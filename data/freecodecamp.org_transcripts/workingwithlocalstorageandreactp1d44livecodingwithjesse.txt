00:05 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jessie sorry about the late start today
00:10 - had some troubleshooting issues with our
00:14 - bulletin app that we're excuse me we're
00:19 - working on converting into react but we
00:22 - did not launch that yet we also wanted
00:25 - to make that a mobile app and a desktop
00:27 - app using react native and electron so
00:31 - we haven't gotten to that yet kind of
00:32 - wish we would have and then I wouldn't
00:34 - have to have this troubleshooting we
00:37 - wouldn't have users with issues the
00:39 - latest issue was someone is using Safari
00:43 - and it's supposed to store some data and
00:46 - local storage so that you don't have to
00:48 - log in every time you should stay logged
00:51 - in for an entire year if you go through
00:53 - the password this login process which is
00:55 - a magic link sent by email but
00:59 - unfortunately it's not working so I've
01:02 - been emailing back and forth trying to
01:03 - figure out what's happening it is the
01:06 - latest version of Safari which is great
01:08 - and now I'm trying to confirm the
01:12 - privacy settings as it's possible the
01:14 - privacy settings are very strict and
01:17 - it's not allowing local storage to work
01:21 - I'm hoping that that's the issue because
01:24 - if it's not I'm out of ideas
01:27 - and I'll probably have to go to this
01:32 - person's office and check the computer
01:34 - myself so hopefully I'll get an email
01:38 - back about that sometime very soon and
01:41 - for today's stream I'm gonna do some
01:45 - things with with cookies we could use
01:48 - local storage for this I guess it
01:50 - depends on what we want to do but I
01:51 - think cookies will be sufficient and
01:55 - we're gonna track whether or not a user
01:58 - has been to our site before if they have
02:02 - been to the site before we're going to
02:03 - show them a different configuration of
02:06 - the homepage then if this is their first
02:08 - time so let me show you
02:12 - the homepage first explain what needs to
02:14 - change and why and then we'll get into
02:17 - some of the code I do want to say thank
02:20 - you to those of you that submitted pull
02:21 - requests over the weekend I've been busy
02:25 - this morning and I have not gotten to
02:28 - review those pull requests but just a
02:31 - little bit that I did see everything
02:33 - looks great so I really appreciate that
02:34 - in a stream later this week I'll go over
02:38 - all this pool requests and and thank you
02:40 - all properly
02:42 - let's see also Harshit finished changing
02:46 - over the resource center project into an
02:51 - electron app so I'm running this now on
02:53 - a Mac so you can see this is it's all
02:58 - working I can download things from here
03:03 - I can send forms actually haven't tried
03:07 - to send the form yet but I'm I think
03:08 - Harsha tried and it did work so yes so
03:13 - this all works as it should which is
03:15 - awesome so I'm gonna do a little bit
03:18 - more testing about that and then
03:19 - hopefully get that out to users as an
03:22 - option so they'll heal her should also
03:24 - finish the react native app as well but
03:28 - I think that when I tried on an Android
03:30 - phone the download feature wasn't
03:32 - working so we'll have to work on that
03:33 - but it'd be nice to offer our users the
03:35 - option of having the mobile app or the
03:38 - desktop app instead of having to rely on
03:41 - their browser and that'll really help
03:43 - users that are having some browser
03:45 - issues with privacy settings or with
03:48 - using an older browser then they won't
03:50 - have to worry about it all right I don't
03:54 - think I've I had a few things to
03:57 - announce I don't think I skipped
03:58 - anything oh the only other thing I
04:03 - wanted to say at the beginning which is
04:05 - just kind of a fun silly thing so I have
04:08 - purchased the domain name JavaScript AF
04:12 - I'm not gonna explain the dot AF part of
04:17 - it if you know then you'll I guess
04:20 - understand why that's kind of funny
04:22 - other
04:23 - I guess you could look it up but I
04:27 - thought it would just be a cool domain
04:29 - to have but I'm not really sure what I
04:31 - want to do with it so I don't know if
04:35 - you'll have any ideas for what type of
04:36 - content should be on JavaScript AF let
04:41 - me know because I I'd like to put
04:45 - something cool on there related to
04:47 - JavaScript and have it be useful so yeah
04:53 - I don't know and if I guess if anybody
04:57 - really wants that domain I could just
04:59 - sell it but I I mean I if I can make
05:03 - some money off that that would be cool I
05:04 - guess but it would also be really cool
05:06 - to actually have a like a useful site
05:15 - Harshit says alert you can't run
05:17 - CloudFlare on AF domains this is bad
05:29 - it hurts to sell it to west boss he has
05:31 - basta si yeah maybe maybe someone will
05:37 - just want to buy it maybe I'll just put
05:38 - it out there on Twitter that I have it
05:41 - if anybody wants it we'll see maybe that
05:46 - could be my personal portfolio side do
05:48 - you think potential employers would
05:51 - think that's funny or would they would
05:53 - that turn them off all right let's see I
06:03 - think sorry I thought I got an email
06:10 - back already about that that issue but
06:17 - it looks like my phone is just behind is
06:20 - getting some old emails
06:28 - okay
06:32 - all right so enough of that let's get
06:36 - started oh I'll go back through when we
06:41 - take our break and reach some warrior
06:43 - suggestions as well and let's see oh I
06:53 - was gonna show you the site first okay
06:55 - let's do that I have it up on my other
07:00 - screen somewhere here we are okay so I
07:07 - made the last time we were working on
07:11 - this we had done this right so that's
07:14 - still there I'm working on adding in a
07:16 - form so that users can request us a
07:20 - mentor training session so I've put in
07:24 - all the server code for setting up a
07:28 - route for that form to go to and then
07:30 - sending it via send grid so I made a new
07:32 - API key if you're interested in learning
07:35 - more about that we did a stream on it
07:37 - earlier so you can go back through the
07:40 - title should be something like using the
07:43 - same grid API something like that and
07:45 - the code is now on the up the upgrade
07:50 - branch so I haven't merged this in the
07:52 - master yet so if you check out the repo
07:54 - in the upgrade branch the last commit
07:56 - was all the code that I added for this
07:59 - so that's available if you want it but
08:03 - today we're going to be working on the
08:04 - home page I'll probably finish up the
08:06 - form later today after the stream
08:08 - assuming I have time so this is what
08:12 - users currently see every user sees this
08:16 - what we're going to change is we're
08:18 - going to keep it like this for new users
08:20 - and then if the user is a returned user
08:24 - we're gonna bring this section up and
08:27 - we're going to display this section as
08:29 - the first section and then the video
08:32 - will be below it so it shouldn't be too
08:35 - difficult probably the most difficult
08:41 - part would just be tracking the user
08:44 - especially if
08:45 - if you've never worked with cookies or
08:46 - local storage or anything like that but
08:51 - I don't think it's going to be a big
08:53 - deal I think we'll get this we'll get
08:55 - through this in today's street so let's
08:59 - get to it
08:59 - let me bring over my plum adoro timer
09:02 - and we'll start it off if you're asking
09:08 - the questions in the live chat now I
09:10 - will get to the questions so just hang
09:15 - on for about 25 minutes and then I'll go
09:18 - back to the questions and answer as many
09:20 - as I can I can also start and grow up
09:26 - and I'm gonna paste a link into the live
09:29 - chat if you follow that link you can see
09:33 - the site as we're working on it when I
09:36 - change something you will see the change
09:38 - you can inspect it with dev tools
09:46 - alright so this was some of the service
09:49 - stuff I was working on let's make it
09:52 - bigger and then move to our our home
09:56 - page index all right I can move this
10:04 - over a bit and let me know if that's
10:07 - large enough so this our own page and
10:18 - for right now we're gonna do everything
10:20 - in this component just to save time
10:23 - might not be a bad idea to make you know
10:26 - kind of a utility component to use but
10:31 - for now this will work what I here's my
10:36 - plan
10:36 - what I think we'll do is in component
10:39 - did mount will check to see will check
10:45 - cookies I'm gonna try to do it with
10:48 - cookies I think but we could do with
10:50 - local storage let me know in the live
10:51 - chat if you see a benefit
10:54 - doing one over the other or if it just
10:57 - doesn't matter I don't really know if
11:00 - there would be any difference between
11:02 - them
11:03 - I know local storage you can put more
11:05 - data in but we really don't need any any
11:07 - data probably just your true or false is
11:11 - all we need
11:14 - but anyway the idea is on component did
11:16 - amount we're gonna check and then based
11:19 - on that I suppose we'll just change our
11:24 - state we'll just add some state here and
11:28 - we'll change the state and then
11:30 - depending on that we can change the
11:37 - position of there's this video but
11:43 - probably this yeah this whole section
11:45 - this whole div section will just change
11:49 - so we can probably should make this its
11:53 - own component if we're going to do that
11:54 - we don't need to if we're just testing
11:56 - but then at some point it would be good
11:59 - to maybe split this out into its own
12:00 - component so it's not taking up so much
12:02 - space especially since we're gonna
12:04 - basically double it
12:08 - Harshit said cookies would get sent to
12:10 - the server which is not required okay
12:13 - maybe we'll do maybe we'll do local
12:16 - storage and yeah which is cool I'm
12:21 - actually more familiar with using local
12:24 - storage than I am with with cookies the
12:28 - harsh it says cookies often get cleared
12:30 - okay all right so let's create a
12:41 - function which check user status
12:50 - [Music]
12:58 - it's
13:02 - how do I always forget to do a how to do
13:06 - an arrow function every time like this
13:18 - why I use arrow functions constantly
13:24 - there we go that's why I just forget the
13:29 - order
13:37 - I've been forgetting weird things lately
13:38 - like yesterday I forgot how to tie a tie
13:41 - for a few minutes I was just and I've
13:43 - known how to tie a tie for years I'm
13:46 - like a slightly afraid and probably
13:49 - irrationally afraid that I have like
13:52 - Alzheimer's starting or something
13:54 - because it does run in my family so now
13:56 - I'm I'm worried about it I really hope
14:00 - that that's not the case I'm only 32 is
14:03 - that even impossible all right so we
14:05 - have the check user status function now
14:07 - and we're going to check local storage
14:12 - all right I do want to do this in a way
14:15 - that to make sure that it doesn't try to
14:18 - do this hmm
14:22 - I don't want it to try to do this server
14:25 - side because we are doing server-side
14:28 - rendering so what does to only happen
14:36 - client-side
14:44 - actually alright I wonder about this so
14:50 - let me know in the live chat if this is
14:53 - not the right way to think about this
14:55 - but users are likely to come to index
14:59 - dodge is the home page first right so
15:02 - that's where they're gonna get a
15:06 - server-side rendered version of this
15:12 - page so we'll component did mount even
15:16 - run in the browser
15:19 - okay harsh it says component did mount
15:21 - does not run on server your right hard
15:24 -  you know what I don't know why I
15:26 - was thinking that I mean we're logging a
15:28 - page view here weird initializing the
15:30 - tabs and this most definitely runs so
15:33 - all right I don't know what I was
15:36 - thinking there but this will work so
15:42 - we're good okay so we're gonna check
15:44 - user status and we'll put that in here
15:48 - as well so that will run and we're gonna
15:57 - do let's just put some some comments
16:00 - here it's gonna be checked check local
16:07 - storage or user let's see if true then
16:23 - display news first
16:37 - user to local stores and set state to
16:48 - false okay so let's let's actually this
16:54 - make state C return user so the default
17:12 - is actually going to be true I guess it
17:19 - doesn't matter what we make the default
17:20 - I was making the default true but that's
17:24 - just how I wrote it here okay
17:33 - uh Hersh it says this does make users
17:38 - does oh okay thank you hard I
17:41 - forgot to write this dot check user
17:45 - status right because these two were
17:47 - importing if you see where he's coming
17:51 - in blog page view and I'm porting an in
17:58 - tab strong I guess I'm not importing and
18:06 - it's just running in a separate
18:07 - JavaScript file but anyway that's why I
18:10 - can just do log page view without this
18:12 - but since we're defining this in here
18:14 - and then we're gonna use this if we end
18:17 - up making this its own component then or
18:22 - a utility function then we can take out
18:26 - this but for now good catch on that are
18:28 -  okay so let's write some of that
18:32 - let's see
18:42 - local storage when you have to get item
18:53 - so how it goes tricky
19:09 - user
19:31 - returned user is true actually thing we
19:36 - don't need to do anything right we may
19:43 - as well do it set the state to true yeah
19:47 - because the user could navigate around
19:52 - and come back so I guess we'll do that
19:55 - you know what I'm gonna use a regular if
19:57 - statement for this true then say this
20:10 - it's states
20:18 - either that's true
20:25 - I need to do this
20:36 - that's good and then else
20:42 - oops
20:43 - and we need to do the local stores local
20:50 - storage set oops
20:57 - set item and we're gonna say return user
21:17 - so no we do it gonna be
21:47 - okay
21:56 - okay
22:01 - let's see all right so we're good there
22:05 - let's grab this
22:17 - why did I do that there that's not what
22:19 - I needed
22:20 - let's bring this here so we still need
22:30 - this to be so either way we're gonna set
22:33 - it to be true afterwards but if it's
22:39 - false so this else means it was false
22:41 - we're gonna add this here so up here we
22:46 - don't need to obviously because if it
22:48 - already found it okay that's good let's
23:00 - see Harshit saying there's a syntax
23:05 - error so have a syntax error somewhere
23:10 - am I supposed to put is it this is
23:14 - supposed to be a string yeah yeah okay
23:20 - okay that's supposed to be a string and
23:25 - I think this is actually supposed to be
23:27 - a string - whoops okay
23:41 - okay in the set stage is correct
23:44 - okay heart should sing that I should
23:47 - wrap the wrap the string in a json.parse
24:08 - okay
24:09 - where which one do I have to wrap in a
24:11 - json.parse
24:26 - essentially I'm not even actually
24:28 - worried about what the value of return
24:30 - user is because if it's false it's just
24:32 - not even going to be there at all so I
24:35 - just need to know if it exists so if
24:40 - that's the case I'm not sure that I I
24:43 - need to put well I mean at this point
24:44 - they ought to just try it out yes then
24:49 - at least it'll be easier for me to see
24:51 - with what the problems are so for now we
24:58 - can just check our state and dev tools
25:04 - to see what's happening before we do
25:07 - anything in the UI okay it looks like
25:11 - there's still a problem on line 33 all
25:15 - right what do I have
25:37 - alright Sim Sim Renji what's what's the
25:40 - problem with line 33
25:49 - so this would be line 33 here
26:02 - all right oh the me window dot local
26:07 - storage
26:12 - so what's the problem with windowed
26:14 - local storage
26:24 - alright let's just save it and then did
26:29 - you see that Harsha did you see it it
26:31 - updated on save it formatted finally got
26:35 - that working thank you for that okay so
26:39 - let's check out hey awesome didn't get
26:44 - any errors very cool and let's go into
26:50 - dev tools and this will be cool if
26:51 - you've never done any troubleshooting
26:54 - with react and chrome dev tools I'll
26:58 - show you how to get to it so you can get
27:02 - the react dev tools so I don't even
27:06 - remember how to get this for Chrome to
27:08 - be honest with you I wish I did cuz I'd
27:09 - like to tell you but it was too long ago
27:12 - that I got it
27:13 - so check out the react dev tools I'm
27:19 - sure you'll it'll be high up in the
27:22 - search results
27:23 - alright so yeah - no let me make this
27:32 - bigger you all probably can't see
27:34 - anything alright so let me expand this
27:37 - we don't need this down here okay so you
27:41 - can see here this looks like your normal
27:43 - your layout of dev tools except these
27:48 - are all the components right so we do
27:52 - see some things like headers and divs
27:53 - and all that but normally in dev tools
27:56 - you wouldn't see all the component names
27:58 - as you can see here we this is our like
28:03 - root component and we can go all the way
28:06 - down here's our layout and let's find
28:11 - our
28:23 - trying to find our main component here
28:32 - it's a suit
28:37 - maybe not
28:43 - some trying to understate see where I
28:47 - stay loose
29:06 - to speak what did we call this component
29:10 - now it's just export default it's just
29:16 - index
29:21 - No
29:27 - I remember we call this maybe I will
29:34 - have to do something in the UI since I
29:35 - can't seem to find my state
30:00 - let's see this should be
30:24 - I had enough we should be somewhere
30:29 - between the nav main it's not where it's
30:33 - gonna be no heroes all right
30:45 - so this is weird I cannot I cannot find
30:50 - the state for that it's possible I'm
30:54 - doing something wrong it happens
30:58 - frequently all right
31:04 - all right harsh it says it is the class
31:06 - one that's what I thought it would be
31:10 - but oh my goodness how did I not see
31:13 - that harshly good job again I'm pretty
31:19 - sure we click that one before
31:21 - anyway I must have just been clicking
31:22 - too fast all right cool so you can see
31:24 - our stake for return user is true which
31:29 - is wonderful and now we can even check
31:32 - in local storage and return user is true
31:37 - wonderful so now we should be able to go
31:41 - in here do whatever you want to do with
31:42 - the UI and let me check my time two
31:46 - minutes we'll see what I can do in two
31:48 - minutes actually let's see if I can get
31:50 - this to work in two minutes I don't
31:52 - really think I can but it'll be fun just
31:55 - to try to do this quickly okay so here's
31:59 - our div and we want to now wrap this div
32:04 - in a ternary that's gonna say this state
32:09 - return user and if it's true then we're
32:16 - going to render this section
32:29 - nope I'm not if it's false I'm going to
32:33 - render this section so let's say the
32:39 - state return user if it's true we're
32:44 - actually going to render the news if
32:46 - it's false we're gonna render this
32:48 - section so let's grab the news down here
32:53 - news announcements
32:57 - okay early yet there we are
33:07 - it's at this stiff
33:11 - it's just
33:17 - think it's this one
33:23 - thanks you okay just copy that and put
33:30 - it here and then down here we're gonna
33:39 - do another ternary and that's gonna be
33:45 - if this state return user is not equal
34:00 - to true what the heck am i doing if if
34:12 - this state return user so if this day
34:21 - return user is false
34:23 - then we're gonna and then we're gonna
34:30 - render this stuff actually
34:36 - this would be so much faster okay let's
34:40 - save it aha I couldn't do it
34:49 - adjacent elements must be wrapped in a
34:51 - closed inside looks like I maybe took
34:57 - one too many divs
34:59 - we're not enough let's pour a div out
35:02 - and see what happens
35:10 - what did I do
35:15 - oh well my timer went off will
35:18 - troubleshoot this after we talk about
35:21 - this so oh well it was fun it was fun to
35:30 - try to do it quickly five minutes in the
35:32 - live chat and then we'll go back to it
35:34 - and figure out what I messed up I think
35:38 - the logic was okay it was just I messed
35:41 - up something with the closing tag a lot
35:48 - of you were saying hi so hey everyone
35:51 - thanks for watching alright real Vignesh
35:57 - says document dot get element by ID some
36:02 - ID inner HTML equals enter HTML plus one
36:05 - can you please explain this statement it
36:12 - looks like somebody was explaining so
36:18 - Dimitri says if inner HTML was a
36:21 - variable then yes
36:31 - this one
36:35 - yeah I'm I'm actually not
36:50 - so you're trying to set the innerhtml of
36:53 - an element with the idea of some ID all
36:57 - right so there's a few things that are
36:59 - weird about that so the some ID has a
37:03 - space there I'm I'm not exactly sure you
37:08 - could do that like it would have to be
37:09 - all together or there's a hyphen in
37:12 - between and then is inter HTML really
37:15 - capitalized like I is capitalized and
37:17 - HTML it could be I just I always thought
37:22 - it would just be lowercase I anyway and
37:26 - then inner HTML plus 1 so normally like
37:32 - what would happen there basically is
37:34 - inner HTML would come up as you're using
37:38 - it there it seems like it's a variable
37:40 - so it will come up as enter HTML zonda
37:42 - fine unless you've defined in or HTML
37:47 - earlier and if you've done that then
37:49 - saying dot inner HTML in your document
37:52 - dot get element by ID is is probably I
37:57 - mean I guess it would still work so if
38:03 - inner HTML is already defined as a
38:06 - variable beforehand and it's a number
38:09 - then that would just increase the number
38:12 - by one if it's a string you would just
38:16 - get the number one concatenated onto the
38:19 - end of it correct I don't know if
38:22 - anybody in the live chat can see that
38:24 - and has a different answer let me know
38:28 - but I think real Vignesh if you're still
38:33 - there
38:33 - and you have like a larger code sample
38:36 - that might help or if you have any
38:39 - response to any of that to clarify that
38:42 - might help
38:47 - all right so here are some ideas for my
38:51 - JavaScript AF domain
38:54 - let's see cloud says maybe fun little
38:57 - code snippets sub in says add cool
39:00 - JavaScript tutorial or should horseshit
39:07 - said sell to west boss Pedro says Don AF
39:11 - is Afghanistan yeah got AF is
39:14 - Afghanistan
39:20 - Clause says that could sell for a lot
39:23 - yeah maybe if it I mean at first I just
39:26 - wanted to buy it because I thought it
39:28 - was fun but yeah you're right I mean
39:31 - maybe someone will want it maybe it'll
39:33 - sell for a lot I just tell them it means
39:39 - at Franciscan yeah that's what I'll tell
39:43 - people at work that it means at
39:44 - Franciscan
39:48 - Andy says react is a good choice but I
39:50 - prefer angular for single page
39:51 - applications
39:52 - I think angular is good - I haven't
39:55 - really worked with the newer versions of
39:56 - angular at all though but I mean a lot
39:59 - of companies and good Deb's use it so
40:01 - I'm sure it's a good option as well
40:18 - John Hanson says doesn't it matter more
40:21 - to what each user expects to see as
40:24 - their personal view of the site cookies
40:26 - set this up easier than doing this in
40:28 - react which may still need a call to the
40:31 - server I'm not sure let's see how this
40:36 - works and see if there's problems with
40:37 - it and it we can always switch back over
40:39 - to cookies if we need to okay him Anshu
40:49 - asks what init tabs means all right
40:53 - let's go back we might as well start
40:56 - this again now we're getting back to the
40:57 - code anyway so here we have a knit tabs
41:02 - this is simply a JavaScript function
41:05 - that I have in another file and all it
41:09 - does is it initializes our tab system
41:13 - which we can't see now I can show you in
41:15 - the live site actually so we have our
41:19 - tabs here so it enables this now this
41:23 - seems really weird in react and it is
41:25 - really weird I don't recommend doing
41:26 - this but this is run by jQuery that's
41:29 - why we did it like that and it is not
41:33 - ideal and I'd love to switch it over to
41:35 - something more proper to react at some
41:38 - point but right now I just need to get
41:40 - this done as quickly as possible so I
41:42 - can get back to the main website project
41:44 - and have that done very soon so that's
41:50 - what it attaches though so I'm gonna get
41:54 - back to the project if I can find a pen
41:57 - I know that I don't have a pen anywhere
42:02 - I need a friend of hence I can write
42:05 - down where I left off sorry I guess it's
42:07 - not gonna happen because I don't have a
42:09 - pen all right
42:11 - blitz
42:16 - let's figure out what I did wrong so it
42:19 - looks like I messed something up with
42:22 - these divs so here's our index this is
42:29 - getting huge
42:32 - we will refactor this at some point
42:35 - hopefully maybe because this is just way
42:39 - too too large all right so here's our
42:41 - main let's scroll all the way up and see
42:44 - what we have
42:45 - after main here just say main main all
42:55 - right so it should be fine that
43:00 - stickiness
43:08 - that's humanity where's the end of
43:13 - stickiness
43:28 - oh there's the end of sticky nevets it's
43:31 - a self-closing tag all right okay so
43:34 - let's make sure we have this close
43:37 - properly we have this div
43:52 - oh this is yeah okay that's closing this
43:56 - out that's fine
44:09 - Oh
44:13 - I think I needed an extra div there okay
44:16 - so I need an extra div there and so down
44:21 - here let's make sure I have the right
44:23 - dose
44:29 - now it looks like I need take these two
44:35 - divs out we put them here let's save it
44:40 - now yay all right cool hmm oops I messed
44:52 - up in my logic all right so this is cool
44:54 - so this works it's up here and then down
44:56 - here we don't have anything so that part
44:59 - works the part I messed up with in my
45:01 - logic was we still want the video to
45:04 - show up we just want it to be below so
45:07 - let's go up to where we did that and
45:09 - what we want
45:18 - really what we can do is completely take
45:21 - this video out of here
45:32 - here we are there's more videos so let's
45:36 - take the video out and put the video
45:44 - here and then I'll clean this up a bit
45:51 - and what we need to do here is say this
45:57 - state return user then we're going to
46:01 - render that this is a little short
46:05 - circuit for your ternary there we are so
46:11 - now we should see a wonderful so we have
46:14 - the news right off the bat then we have
46:16 - our video and then the rest of the page
46:19 - wonderful this works good now let's test
46:25 - out what happens whenever we go back to
46:29 - being a new user just to make sure so we
46:33 - can go into react and we can go back to
46:36 - our component and let's change this to
46:39 - false and now let's see what our page
46:44 - looks like there we are
46:46 - so you can see now we've changed it to
46:49 - false manually and here's how our page
46:52 - looks and this is at the bottom whoa
46:55 - all right you know what that this isn't
46:57 - working only because we changed it
46:59 - manually because it needs component yeah
47:09 - so let's let's refresh so this works now
47:15 - and these do work and let me go
47:19 - I'm gonna use my let's use an incognito
47:24 - window to go to the same place
47:34 - why did it see that
47:41 - look willows should not persist in
47:44 - incognito correct
47:53 - all right we bring up an entirely
47:55 - different browser hmm I think I may have
48:02 - messed something up because here in
48:04 - Safari we have the same thing all right
48:06 - let's take a look back here what we're
48:08 - doing so we're gonna check user status
48:12 - if the get item returned user is there
48:28 - at least that's what I thought it was
48:30 - gonna be
48:56 - oh I never mind
49:15 - all right let's try this
49:19 - try a new incognito window there we are
49:25 - okay all right let me explain what I had
49:28 - done that that was just silly so what I
49:31 - was doing was I was setting the state to
49:35 - true no matter what
49:36 - so if returnin user did exist in local
49:40 - storage we're setting it to true which
49:42 - is correct but then if it didn't exist
49:44 - we're still setting the state to true
49:45 - which is not what we wanted right what I
49:49 - had done I believe was copy and pasted
49:51 - this from here and never change the
49:53 - value so we want to set this to false
49:55 - but then afterwards set our local
49:58 - storage to true now what I want to do is
50:02 - test this out again here let's still
50:06 - check ok all right so this is working
50:12 - and let's double check in another
50:15 - browser so I'm gonna put a firefox this
50:17 - time make sure it all works so let's go
50:23 - I don't know there we go
50:32 - 3,000 all right good so first time we're
50:37 - here we're seeing this and now that's
50:41 - let's go to an interior page and then
50:44 - let's come back great now we're return
50:47 - user right we've come back to this page
50:49 - again and now we have our other view
50:52 - wonderful alright cool so we verified it
50:56 - works we've gotten it to load on three
50:59 - different browsers awesome ok so I'm not
51:05 - the the holo
51:10 - reasoning behind knowing it like this is
51:12 - that the the people who are doing this
51:15 - site for really wanted users when they
51:18 - come back to immediately see what's new
51:21 - what's going on so that's why they
51:23 - wanted this here but they really really
51:25 - liked this video this video explains
51:28 - what this thing is all about so they
51:31 - wanted a nice introduction for new
51:33 - people but then they want to return
51:36 - users to be able to see this so that's
51:39 - when I there was a debate about what
51:43 - section to put at the top and I said
51:45 - well I mean we could just switch it
51:46 - based on whether the users been here
51:49 - already or not so that's why we ended up
51:52 - going with this jammed up being good
51:54 - because then we didn't have to debate it
51:56 - anymore we could move on to other stuff
51:58 - so anyway that was the point of this it
52:02 - works which is great and we got it done
52:06 - pretty quickly so not bad I mean I don't
52:13 - want to make myself sound really good
52:14 - but I'm just like I'm happy when things
52:17 - work out so quickly it's I'm happy about
52:19 - that alright so let's go let me go to
52:25 - the live chat and I'll have have some
52:28 - time to answer some questions so if you
52:30 - have any questions please put them in
52:33 - the live chat now
52:36 - and that's I can remember where it left
52:44 - off here all right I found it
52:51 - Muhammad says hello how's it going
52:54 - thanks for watching Muhammad says all I
52:58 - know is basic basic HTML but I'm a 3d
53:01 - modeler so I don't feel guilty
53:04 - so that wish I could learn this yeah
53:07 - well Muhammad feel free to ask as many
53:10 - questions as you want here I'll do my
53:12 - best to answer them
53:13 - and if you need me to go over something
53:15 - again I mean I can do that sorry
53:45 - alright there's a lot of talk about
53:47 - whether or not I was writing these
53:49 - functions correctly got it oh that's
53:52 - just hey tech says today's question is
54:00 - using cookies in JavaScript yeah
54:03 - basically we were I was thinking we
54:05 - would use cookies but we end up using
54:06 - local storage which is easy either local
54:09 - storage is easier anyway so that works
54:13 - maybe I'll go back and change the title
54:15 - to local storage
54:28 - it's sec a stood
54:31 - I'm using Visual Studio code today to my
54:34 - earlier videos I used atom a lot and now
54:37 - I've switched over to the s code they're
54:40 - both really good Lucas says hi Jesse my
54:46 - name is Lucas and I'm from Brazil I I
54:49 - like so much your your live your code is
54:52 - very good awesome thank you thank you
54:55 - for saying that I really appreciate that
55:01 - see Brooke says hi oh just got back from
55:04 - [Music]
55:06 - kanessa therapy what did I miss
55:10 - can easily repeat I don't know how to
55:12 - pronounce that type of therapy but
55:14 - anyway I'm glad you're back rook I hope
55:16 - everything's going well with your
55:17 - therapy basically we just saved some
55:23 - data to local storage we just wanted to
55:25 - know whether or not a user has been
55:26 - there or not so we really just could
55:28 - save anything we wanted to local storage
55:30 - and just check to see if there is
55:32 - anything in local storage for this
55:34 - domain and then based on that we show
55:37 - the sections on the front page in a
55:41 - different order
55:51 - sumon says Wow how do you maintain such
55:53 - a huge file I do the same thing to ya
55:57 - right now the file is larger than I
55:59 - would like so it's just it's just it
56:02 - makes it difficult the larger the file
56:04 - gets the more difficult I think is to
56:06 - keep in your head where everything is so
56:08 - it's just like extra cognitive load on
56:11 - your mind so I think smaller files are
56:13 - much easier to deal with so there are a
56:16 - few areas in this file right now where
56:19 - we could refactor and make it a lot
56:21 - smaller so I think that's that would be
56:24 - good to do maybe I'll put that in as an
56:30 - issue in the github repo and if
56:32 - anybody's interested you can take a shot
56:34 - at refactoring to be honest with you I'm
56:37 - probably not gonna take the time to
56:39 - refactor right now because I need to get
56:42 - back to my other project so this will be
56:44 - something at least for my to do this
56:46 - this will be something that's like hey
56:49 - if you ever have some time where you
56:51 - don't have anything that's due like
56:55 - right now go back and refactor this
57:03 - sathya says hey how about a session on
57:07 - material UI next with react is material
57:14 - UI next a thing or are you saying like
57:17 - material you I and next with react so we
57:22 - have done some sessions on material UI
57:24 - and next we're going to be we're going
57:26 - to continue working with material James
57:31 - says is this to show how to make a
57:33 - cookie yeah well we ended up going with
57:36 - local storage so local stories
57:39 - essentially does pretty much the same
57:41 - things as cookies doing in some sites
57:43 - I'm not saying they are the same but
57:46 - they are used in the same use cases
57:50 - frequently so we ended up going with
57:53 - local storage - not exactly cookies
57:57 - although in some browsers if you go to
58:00 - empty the cookies it actually empties
58:03 - out local storage
58:04 - well which is odd I think maybe like
58:06 - Internet Explorer does that and maybe
58:09 - like if you use CCleaner on Windows and
58:14 - you go to empty out the I think it's
58:16 - cookies I can't remember for sure but I
58:18 - have come across before that local
58:20 - storage gets lumped into the category of
58:21 - cookies which is kind of misleading I
58:25 - guess but sometimes that does happen
58:38 - I know says hello everybody hey how's it
58:42 - going
58:50 - yes
58:56 - all right I've got a question here in
59:00 - another language ready to google
59:01 - translate that let's see
59:12 - all right so I think maybe my Google
59:14 - Translate is not working properly
59:19 - because it says that the attend read
59:25 - just said what is India doing in the hey
59:28 - so I I'm not really sure I think I the
59:32 - translated it doesn't seem correct so so
59:37 - let me know what that that was really
59:39 - supposed to mean
59:40 - yet and rrah so it says the language is
59:46 - Hindi so if anybody knows Hindi you can
59:49 - let me know Sathya says just fold the
59:57 - code they copy them oh that would have
59:59 - been such a good idea okay I got a
60:03 - customer service Co here
60:06 - hello yeah yeah hey how are you oh yeah
60:17 - definitely
60:19 - so I'm when you come in the marketing
60:22 - department and you you make immediately
60:25 - make a left and I'm the first office
60:28 - there it'll say okay
60:34 - yeah yeah go to the middle down by the
60:37 - the seminar room and then there's that
60:40 - door to go into marketing and
60:43 - development everything yep and I'm first
60:47 - order left my name will be on there all
60:50 - right no problem
60:53 - all right so that's cool so the
60:56 - professor that was having trouble with
60:57 - the bulletin is gonna bring his laptop
61:01 - over here which is awesome because
61:03 - normally I have to go find other people
61:07 - at their office and I I do that just
61:09 - yeah the courtesy you know I say hey you
61:12 - know my sites not working I'll come help
61:14 - you
61:15 - just as soon as for dinner all right
61:21 - let's see
61:36 - all right you all Michael and hard
61:41 - you all saw my my problem before I did
61:45 - so thanks for that I should just looked
61:47 - over let's see
61:55 - ash says I thought this project was done
61:58 - yeah it it was done and launched but
62:02 - then we had a meeting and there were
62:05 - some updates that they wanted so
62:07 - basically like they're adding some
62:10 - things on that they didn't have before
62:12 - so offerings like they have his mentor
62:14 - training going on and they I guess
62:18 - they've gotten some feedback had some
62:19 - new ideas so there's a series of updates
62:22 - that are gonna happen some of them need
62:25 - to happen right now some of them can
62:27 - wait until later and are a little bit
62:29 - more complicated so I'm just gonna do
62:31 - the updates that need to be done right
62:32 - now I'm gonna try to do them now so we
62:34 - can move back into our other project
62:37 - which to be honest with you is is more
62:39 - important right now because it's going
62:42 - to serve a lot more users so it's tough
62:46 - to tell you know a client or somebody
62:48 - like hey I got other projects that are
62:50 - more important because everybody thinks
62:52 - their projects is important which is
62:54 - it's important to them it's true but I
62:57 - want to do at least do something so that
63:00 - I can so we can get some of the features
63:03 - on this site first and then move it over
63:06 - so today I'll probably be working on
63:09 - this site and then maybe tomorrow after
63:12 - I want to be done with it all I will
63:14 - probably have to wait on some feedback
63:16 - and content from them so I can't
63:18 - actually get this stuff live as soon as
63:20 - I want that's but that's kinda how it is
63:24 - I that's how it always is you know if
63:26 - you don't have the content you can't
63:28 - really launch
63:38 - Harshit says there is a delay in
63:41 - switching the views for new users as CDM
63:49 - is not fired immediately use my method
64:01 - all right so hard saying change default
64:03 - state to false and remove set state from
64:08 - else and change default state the Falls
64:11 - all right let's see
64:13 - they were react all right so remove this
64:19 - and then make the default state false
64:35 - okay I like that we got rid of two lines
64:39 - of one minor code just verified still
64:45 - gonna work yeah it still works
64:48 - open up incognito window oh yeah yeah
65:04 - just go in have a seat
65:07 - okay I'm doing a live show here so I'm
65:09 - just gonna finish it up oh it's nice you
65:12 - brought me some beer good didn't have
65:17 - money to go all right everyone so I have
65:23 - a professor here who I'm gonna help out
65:25 - with some issues with that bulletin
65:27 - project that we were working on before
65:29 - and anyway so uh I think I got to
65:34 - everybody's question on how I see your
65:36 - question you know what send me a direct
65:39 - message on Twitter or can you put that
65:40 - question in the comments and I will get

65:45 - and anybody else who has a question that
65:48 - I can't get to right now go ahead and
65:51 - just send me a DM or put in the comments
65:53 - so anyway thank you so much for watching
65:55 - I appreciate all the help it definitely
