00:00 - Hey, welcome to Draft CAD me my name is Mike in this course, I'm gonna cover everything you need to know to get started
00:05 - writing HTML
00:07 - HTML stands for hypertext
00:10 - Markup language and it's basically just a language that we can use to create web pages
00:15 - So if you've ever been on the internet almost every single page on the internet was written in this language called HTML
00:22 - And in HTML you can define the series of HTML tags
00:26 - Which will define the layout and the look and the feel of your website
00:31 - So if you can learn what those HTML tags are and if you can learn where to put them and how to use them together
00:36 - Then you can build your own website. It's actually a lot easier than people think to build a custom website
00:41 - I mean so often people will run off to use like content management systems or they use programs to build websites for them
00:48 - But sometimes it's fun to just go in and get your hands dirty and start building a website from scratch
00:53 - And you're gonna learn how to do that in this course in this course
00:57 - I'm gonna cover the basics of using HTML
00:59 - So from the first lesson on to the last lesson
01:02 - You're gonna be writing HTML you're gonna be learning new tags and you're gonna be learning new ways to manipulate a webpage to make it
01:09 - Look and feel the way that you want it to hTML is an invaluable skill
01:13 - I mean even just putting HTML experience on your resume
01:16 - Could help you get a job one day or it could just be something cool that you could brag to your friends about as awesome
01:21 - As it is
01:22 - I think sometimes people can be a little bit
01:24 - Intimidated to try and learn HTML because it seems like there's so much to learn and it seems so complicated
01:29 - I'm here to tell you that it's actually really
01:31 - Easy to learn and I'm gonna be here with you throughout the entire course walking you through all of the basics. Trust me
01:37 - I've known HTML for a while so I know what's worth learning and what's not we're gonna cover everything that you need
01:43 - We're going to talk about all the important things and by the end of this course, you're gonna have a true and full
01:48 - Understanding of what hTML is how to use it and how to build your own website
01:56 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about choosing a text editor for
02:01 - HTML now whenever you are writing HTML, you're actually writing it inside of what's called an HTML file
02:08 - So this is a file just a lot like a text file but instead of a dot
02:12 - Txt or a dot do CX extension. We have a dot HTML extension
02:17 - so with HTML you're basically just writing these HTML files and then your web browser is able to take those files and
02:24 - Display them as web pages and it's some of this really cool thing
02:27 - but the first step in writing hTML is picking some program that you can use to write these HTML files and
02:34 - There's a bunch of different options
02:36 - when you're trying to choose an HTML text editor and I think a lot of times it can get a little bit confusing or maybe
02:43 - even a little bit overwhelming just because there's so many options and so many people have different opinions on which is the best
02:49 - Editor and you know, what's the best thing for beginners to do in this video?
02:53 - I just want to give you an overview of like what are your options and then maybe give you some recommendations?
02:58 - As far as like where to start so with HTML text editors, really all you need is just a simple text editor
03:05 - so any text editor that you have which is capable of editing files and saving them in different formats is gonna work for you and
03:12 - Generally when you're writing HTML, you don't want to use like a word processing program
03:17 - There's a lot of word processors out there, you know Microsoft Word Google Docs LibreOffice
03:23 - These are like these big word processing programs
03:26 - and
03:26 - This is generally not something that you want to use
03:28 - so you don't want to be typing out your HTML inside of a you know, Microsoft Word, that's
03:33 - Kind of an overkill when you're running HTML the simpler the better
03:37 - So a lot of times for beginners people will recommend that you use the just very simple text editor that you have on your computer
03:44 - On windows it's gonna be notepad on Mac
03:47 - It's like TextEdit and these are just the bare-bones
03:51 - Simple text editors and it's actually more than enough that you need to write
03:55 - HTML and so like I said generally for beginners writing HTML in something simple like notepad or TextEdit
04:03 - really forces you to focus on writing the HTML and you
04:07 - to type out every single line and you have to really look to make sure that everything's formatted correctly and
04:12 - Ultimately, it'll just help you to really grasp the fundamentals
04:15 - But if you're somebody who doesn't want to use like notepad or TextEdit
04:20 - You can actually use a specially designed
04:23 - Program and there's a bunch of these programs out there which are specially designed to write HTML in some of the popular programs
04:30 - There's one called atom sublime
04:33 - Brackets txt regular webstorm. There's a bunch of these different programs that have been developed by different companies and
04:40 - you can go online and do a bunch of research, but
04:43 - Essentially what these are are programs that are especially designed to help you write your HTML
04:48 - So they'll take the HTML and they might display it differently
04:51 - They might give you the ability to use like add-ons or different features that will make writing HTML a little bit easier
04:58 - But as a penalty for that
05:00 - They're also a little bit more complicated to use and so like I said generally for beginners like the less
05:06 - Complicated things are the better. So you may want to err more on the side of doing something simple
05:10 - And then once you learn HTML move up to one of these other programs, I want to show you sort of the difference in what?
05:17 - these might look like
05:20 - So over here, I have TextEdit and this is just the default like text editor on Macs
05:25 - So if I open this you'll see here I have this file and this is actually an HTML file
05:30 - So inside of this file
05:32 - I have written a bunch of HTML and this is like the simplest HTML document you're ever gonna see
05:37 - But this is what writing HTML would look like in something like this
05:41 - and so if I wanted to add some more HTML down here I could just type it out and
05:47 - You know, it's very simple there's nothing to configure there's nothing to add on you just sort of write out your HTML
05:54 - But something more complicated it would be a program like this
05:58 - This is called Adam
05:59 - and this is one of those text editors I was talking about and this makes it you know a little bit easier for you to
06:05 - Write the HTML you can see it's formatted a little bit differently, right? So
06:09 - This is the same code by the way. So over here, these little tags are color. This is colored up here
06:15 - So there's different colors generally programs
06:18 - Like this will allow you to choose different themes so I could you know
06:21 - Make the whole look in the feel of this different. So there's a lot of really cool options and
06:27 - Configuration options that you can use with a text editor like this
06:30 - But we also need to understand is writing HTML and this is doing exactly the same thing as this doing functionally
06:36 - These are the same thing. They're just you know, it's an environment for us to write HTML in so here's my recommendation to you
06:43 - I would definitely recommend and a lot of people recommend this starting with a simple text editor like this. It doesn't have to be
06:52 - TextEdit, but it can be something simple and the whole idea
06:55 - Is that the simpler the better when you're first learning HTML?
06:58 - You don't want to have to worry about you know, configuring different things or working with some heavy text editor
07:03 - you know using something light and simple like
07:06 - TextEdit is just gonna allow you to focus on the HTML and then once you have a grasp for writing HTML
07:11 - And you really feel comfortable doing it. Then you can move up to a program like this now, obviously, that's just my recommendation
07:18 - You don't have to listen to me. And if you do want to choose a program like this
07:24 - Definitely do your research try out a couple different programs see which one fits for you
07:29 - You're gonna hear a lot of people online saying like this text editor is the best that one's the best, you know
07:34 - People always get into little fights about those things. But the best text editor is the one that is right for you
07:39 - And so it's the one that you enjoy using the most
07:42 - Don't listen so much to what other people are saying
07:44 - the best way to pick is just to try a bunch of these different text editors and as you go through this course
07:49 - Even you can try a bunch of different ones and see how you like using each one
07:53 - but again for beginners
07:54 - I would recommend starting simple hTML is a really simple language
07:58 - And so the less you can bog it down with like all these
08:02 - Plugins and add-ons and themes like the better it is because with web development and just programming in general
08:07 - It's usually the simpler and the more straightforward something is the better it is
08:15 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about creating your first HTML file
08:20 - So I'm going to show you how to create an HTML file
08:22 - I'll show you how you can view that HTML file on your web browser and I'll show you how to set up your
08:28 - HTML file with some default HTML code in order to make it work properly
08:34 - So the first thing I'm going to do is create a folder for my project
08:39 - so I'm gonna create a folder that I can put my HTML files in for my website over here in my
08:44 - file explorer I'm just gonna make a new folder and
08:48 - I'm just gonna call this
08:50 - GA underscores site for draft Khadem e site and
08:55 - then now what we can do is open up this folder inside of my text editor so I'm gonna come over here and I'll just
09:02 - this project folder
09:05 - And now inside of this folder I'm gonna create a new file so I'm gonna say new file and I'm just gonna call this
09:15 - Index dot HTML
09:17 - Now the reason I'm naming this file index dot HTML is because generally when you're creating your first web page
09:24 - You want to name it index dot HTML
09:27 - Index that HTML is a special file name that we can use and if a file is named index.html
09:33 - And it's at the root directory of your folder. Then your web browser will think that that's the home page of your website
09:40 - So if you're just creating one web page like this, it's a good idea for us to name it index dot HTML
09:46 - But really you can name it whatever you want. I'm gonna name mine
09:49 - index.html and
09:51 - So now we have our HTML file open. So this is actually a
09:56 - File now that we can use and view on our web browser
09:59 - So if I just came over here and type hello world
10:02 - I can actually take this file and I'm just gonna open it up inside of my web browser
10:08 - So I'm gonna click open open with and then I'll open it with my web browser
10:13 - So I'm going to open it with Google Chrome
10:15 - And now what will happen and you'll see this file will open up and over here on the web browser
10:21 - We have our text. So this is like the simplest
10:25 - purest form of HTML which is just typing out some bare-bones text inside of an HTML file and
10:31 - It'll display here on our screen. But if we want to have an HTML file that's like an official file and that's structured correctly
10:39 - We're actually gonna have to add in some extra
10:42 - Code in here so I'm gonna get rid of this and we're gonna create what's called an HTML tag
10:49 - Now hTML is a language that's used to define
10:53 - Layouts for web pages and we can define those layouts
10:57 - Using things called tags so I can create a series of tags and those tags will basically tell my web browser
11:04 - How I want my website to look and what content I want to have on my website. So
11:10 - in order to kind of
11:12 - Start creating our HTML file. We're gonna have to create a basic
11:16 - Skeleton of HTML tags and these are just standard tags that every HTML file is gonna have and they're basically going to give our browser
11:24 - Different information about what's in our file so up here
11:28 - The first tag that I want to create is gonna be called
11:31 - doctype and we're basically going to define what the document type of this file is gonna be and
11:37 - We're gonna create an HTML file. So i'm gonna type an exclamation point
11:42 - Do see typ e all caps just like that and then I want to say HTML
11:48 - So this tag is basically telling my web browser
11:51 - the type of this document is
11:54 - HTML so, this is an HTML document and
11:57 - Now down here. I can start creating what are called container tags. So this is a single tag
12:04 - We only need one of these tags, but in HTML
12:07 - There's a lot of tags which are called container tags and it basically means that there's two tags
12:12 - So there's a starting tag and there's an ending tag and you can put other tags inside of them
12:17 - So they act as containers for either content or other HTML tags
12:22 - And the first one we're gonna create is just called the HTML tag, so I'm gonna make it less than sign
12:28 - HTML and a greater than sign and now I can close off this tag
12:33 - So this is the starting tag, and I want to create an ending tag
12:36 - So I'm going to create that down here
12:38 - and the way that you create an Tagg is you take the name of the starting tag and
12:43 - You basically just put a forward slash before it and then you type out the name of the starting tag
12:48 - So this is now a pair of tags and you can see the relationship right? So up here. We have the starting tag
12:55 - So hTML is the name of this tag, you could say that this is an HTML tag and this is the ending tag
13:01 - So it uses that same name, but it uses this forward slash
13:05 - so that forward slash is used to denote that this is the ending tag and this HTML tag is
13:11 - Gonna be necessary for any HTML files that you have. This is basically like the highest level tag in our website
13:18 - It's like the overall container tag for our website. And so all of the
13:23 - HTML code and HTML tags are gonna go inside of here
13:27 - So now there's two other sets of tags that I need to create
13:31 - The first set is called the head tags, and the second is called the body tags
13:36 - So in any HTML file, there's two basic sections
13:40 - There's the head of the document and then there's the body of the document and the head of the document
13:45 - Defines data about the document so we can define things like the title of the document we can give the document a description
13:53 - We could define other attributes about the document like maybe an image that's associated to the document
13:58 - We can also use the head to import any resources that we need into our HTML file
14:04 - so you'll find out later that we can actually link this HTML file to other types of files and
14:10 - Inside of the head we can do all of that. So the head is sort of like the settings of the HTML file
14:16 - It's like the command center
14:17 - It's sort of like metadata about the actual file and we can create the head by creating head tags
14:23 - So it's gonna be a less than sign we're gonna type head and now we can close off this tag
14:30 - just like that and
14:32 - Now I'm going to create a body tag
14:34 - So the body tag is where we're gonna put like the meat and the bones of the HTML page
14:40 - So the body tag is where all of our HTML content is going to go
14:44 - Generally, the body is gonna be a lot bigger than the head
14:46 - The body is gonna be where you're actually putting all the content for your web page
14:51 - So anything that's in the body for the most part is gonna show up or at least it's gonna get rendered by the browser
14:57 - Now down here. I'm just gonna make these body tags. So I'm gonna say body and we'll make another closing tag
15:05 - Body and so I'm defining all of these different tags
15:08 - And when I open this file up inside of my web browser
15:12 - The web browser is able to look through all of these tags and figure out
15:17 - information about the page
15:18 - so the web browser can actually like parse through all of these different tags and it can figure out how to
15:24 - Display all of the information so you can define
15:27 - information and you can use tags to
15:30 - help define that information and layout that information differently and the web browser will be able to parse through all of that and basically
15:37 - Decipher it and use it to build a website. So it's really cool
15:41 - Now one thing I want to point out is the way that I'm formatting everything
15:45 - so you'll notice here that I have these HTML tags and
15:49 - Inside of these HTML tags. I have this head tag, and I have this body tag
15:53 - So I want to point out the relationship between all of these tags
15:57 - And I'm also going to introduce you guys to some terminology
16:00 - The first thing you want to notice is that I'm indenting the head tag
16:03 - And I'm indenting the body tag so you can see there's like a couple of spaces here
16:07 - this is basically just a tab and
16:09 - Generally when you're writing HTML
16:11 - You want to indent all of your files? And so the rules for indenting are basically like we have this container, right?
16:18 - So I have this HTML tag and this HTML tag and inside of here. We have the head in the body
16:23 - So any tags that are inside other tags you want to indent and so it's just like this
16:29 - Right this head tag is inside of this HTML tag, so I'm indenting it same thing with the body
16:35 - I'm indenting it and that will basically
16:38 - visually help you to decipher the relationships between the tags and we can actually define the
16:43 - relationships with these tags and one of the most common ways to do that is with like
16:48 - family terminology
16:49 - So we would refer to this HTML tag up here as the parent of this head tag
16:55 - And this body tag, so the body tag is the child of the HTML tag because it's inside of it
17:03 - So if you ever talking to like HTML developers a lot of times, they'll you that terminology
17:07 - they'll say like oh the head tag is the child of the HTML tag so I could ask you like
17:13 - What's the parent of this body tag and the answer would be the HTML tag because the body tag is?
17:19 - Inside of the HTML tag we would also define the head tag and the body tag as siblings
17:25 - So these would be sibling tags because they share the same parent and so you can kind of understand that relationship
17:32 - so if I was to create a series of tags inside of here another tag
17:36 - We can make is like a paragraph. Actually, you would want to put it in the head. We want to put it in the body
17:42 - So I could create a paragraph tag and don't worry too much about what paragraph tags are we're gonna get into that. But this
17:49 - Paragraph tag would be the grandchild of this HTML tag
17:54 - And it would be the child of this body tag
17:57 - So that's kind of like some terminology that you're gonna hear a lot, you know, generally we're defining these
18:03 - HTML tags in terms of like generational syntax, so parent child grandparent you get the point
18:10 - So now that we have this basic HTML skeleton laid out. We essentially have everything that we need for
18:16 - This website and so I can refresh
18:19 - Or I can save this page and I'm actually gonna head over here into my browser
18:23 - And now when we refresh this page, you'll see that nothing happens. So this is a completely blank
18:28 - HTML document it's like the simplest HTML document that we could ever write
18:32 - So I'm gonna show you one more tag that you can use and this is called the title tag
18:38 - So up here in the head of the document. I'm going to create another tag called title and
18:44 - this tag
18:46 - We're gonna put some information in here. So generally when you have HTML tags certain tags are meant as containers
18:52 - So for example, this HTML set of tags is a container
18:57 - It's basically used to hold other tags, but certain tags are used to hold content
19:02 - So this title tag is used to hold text and so inside of these title tags
19:07 - We want to put text and this is going to be the title of my website so I could say like Mike's
19:13 - Website and this is gonna now be the official title of our website and you'll notice that if I come over my web browser
19:20 - Look up here at this tab. You can see the title up here is currently
19:26 - Index.html. That's the name of the file. But when I refresh this file, you'll see that it updates to Mike's website
19:32 - so this is a good example of the browser is able to parse through our website and it's able to read these title tags and
19:40 - figure out what the title of our website is
19:42 - So these are the kind of tags that you can put inside of your head or like title tags
19:47 - You know tags that are defining information about the HTML document
19:51 - And so down here in the body tag, I could put any content that I want to have inside of my web page
19:57 - so I can put like
19:59 - Hello world
20:01 - Down here. And now when I refresh the page, it'll show up in my web browser
20:07 - So that's how you want to go writing out content on your website
20:10 - Any of the content is gonna go inside of these body tags and throughout the rest of this course
20:14 - We're gonna get into all the cool tags that you can put inside this body tag, seriously
20:19 - There's so many of these awesome tags in HTML and there's so many tags that can help us to do awesome things
20:25 - Inside of our web browser. So I hope you stick around and we'll learn how to put stuff inside the body
20:33 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about using some basic HTML tags
20:38 - So we're gonna look at some of the most
20:40 - Common HTML tags that you're going to be using in your website and we'll use them to define a pretty good looking site
20:47 - So by the end of this video you'll have a good idea of how to layout a bunch of content inside of HTML
20:53 - And display it on your browser
20:55 - the first tag that I want to show you is a tag that
20:58 - actually is going to go up here in the head of our document and I'm gonna put it right here above the title and
21:04 - Right now I just have a basic skeleton of an HTML file
21:07 - It's sort of like the simplest version of an HTML file
21:10 - and one thing that I want to do is define something called a meta tag and a meta tag is basically a
21:18 - Tag that defines information about our file
21:21 - So it's giving us metadata so I can use this less than sign and I'm gonna define this meta tag
21:28 - And I'm basically just gonna use this to define the character encoding for my webpage
21:34 - so this is basically just telling the web browser what types of characters I'm using inside of this document so I can say
21:42 - Char set is equal to and then inside of these quotation marks. I'm just gonna say
21:47 - UTF
21:49 - - 8 and this will define the character set for my document as utf-8
21:55 - Which is like a really common character set. It's the character set that I'm using
21:59 - So like I said, this is a meta tag, and it's used to define information about our file
22:04 - I'm gonna define one more meta tag, and this is gonna be a meta description tag
22:09 - and so we can use this tag to basically give a
22:13 - Description for our website and this tag can be used by things like web browsers. So for example, Google
22:19 - Could go into our file look at this meta tag, and it can use it to display information on its search pages
22:26 - So generally when you search for something on Google a lot of times
22:29 - they'll be like a little description of it and they're using this tag from the file so I can say
22:34 - meta and I'm gonna say name is equal to
22:39 - description and now I'm gonna say
22:45 - Content is
22:46 - Equal to and now I can type the description for my website so I could say like this is an awesome
22:54 - Website and now we have this description which is just like this is an awesome website and I'm gonna go ahead and end this tag
23:01 - So I want to show you guys
23:03 - one concept or you know, one thing in HTML, which is
23:08 - HTML attributes now we have these HTML tags. So this is a meta tag right here
23:14 - This is a meta tag, but inside of these tags, we have things called attributes. Sometimes people call them attributes
23:20 - Sometimes people call them properties. Basically, we're passing this tag some information
23:26 - So I have my meta tag, and I'm giving this tag some custom information
23:31 - So inside of this meta tag, I'm telling it what type of information I wanted to find
23:36 - So I'm telling it that I want to define a description and I'm telling it what that description should be
23:42 - So a lot of times in these HTML tags, you can pass them
23:46 - attributes or properties
23:48 - And those tags will be able to use those attributes and properties to do their job
23:53 - So this meta tags job is to define metadata about the file and when we pass it these attributes or properties
24:01 - We're giving it the information that it needs to define that metadata
24:05 - So a lot of times inside of our HTML tags
24:08 - We're gonna have different attributes and we're gonna have to give those tags different information
24:14 - So just keep that in mind and these meta tags kind of do a good job of showing that because they take you like this
24:20 - one takes two attributes
24:22 - So those are two tags that we can define up here in the head of our document now
24:26 - Let's move down into the body of our document and we'll start having some fun
24:31 - So the body of the document is where we can put all of like the actual
24:34 - content for our website
24:36 - so all this stuff that you see on the website is generally gonna go here inside the body now the first tag
24:43 - I want to show you guys is
24:45 - Basically a tag that we can use to define a header or like a title on our website so over here I have this
24:52 - Hello world, but I'm just gonna get rid of that because I don't really like it
24:56 - Imagine that I want to give my website a headache, right?
24:59 - So I wanted to define like the heading for my website well over here
25:03 - I can use something called a heading tag
25:06 - And the way that we write this heading tag is with lesson sign and I'm gonna use this H and then after H
25:13 - I'm gonna give this a number so I can give this a number either 1 through 6 so I can give it a 2
25:20 - 3 4 5 or a 6 and this will basically
25:24 - Spit out a header for our website. So header 1 let's just say that this is gonna be Mike's
25:32 - Website and
25:34 - I'm gonna use this ending tag right here. So this is an example of the tag
25:37 - That's gonna take some text input inside of it. And now when I go over here and I refresh my page
25:43 - You'll notice that Mike's website shows up and it's nice and big right?
25:47 - So I have this nice big header on my website and it's you know
25:50 - The text is really big and it looks really good
25:52 - And in addition to defining an h1, I could also make this an h2
25:57 - And so now when I make this an h2, it's gonna be a little bit smaller
26:00 - So you see that it shrunk a little bit and I can make this an h4, and it's gonna shrink even more
26:07 - and
26:09 - I can go all the way down to an h6
26:11 - Which is the smallest size of header that hTML is gonna allow us to define and that's gonna be a pretty small header
26:17 - So anytime you want to sort of like announce something or you want a like title?
26:22 - maybe like a
26:23 - section of a document you can use these headers and the headers will look a little bit bigger and bolder than just normal text would
26:31 - So in addition to having a header, maybe we'll leave this as an h2. I
26:35 - can also define just regular textual information so I can define like a paragraph on my website and
26:42 - If you're writing like an article or a web page a lot of times you're gonna want to use a paragraph, right?
26:48 - You're gonna want to have some text on your website
26:50 - so I can make what's called a paragraph tag and a paragraph tag is just gonna be
26:54 - P and then we're also going to need an ending tag
26:56 - and now any text that I write in here is gonna go inside of its own paragraph so I could write like this is my
27:05 - paragraph and
27:07 - Now when I refresh my page
27:08 - You'll see that this showed up in its own paragraph. And what's cool about paragraphs is that they'll
27:14 - Automatically sort of format themselves so I could actually make another paragraph right below this
27:21 - So we could say this is another
27:24 - paragraph and this paragraph will automatically space itself out and it'll be
27:30 - Below this other paragraph. Okay, so
27:34 - we have this paragraph and then we have this paragraph and they're kind of just like lined up like that and you can put as
27:38 - Much text as you want inside these paragraphs and generally whenever you're writing out like a block of text you're gonna want to use this
27:45 - paragraph tag
27:47 - Now we can also style some of the elements inside of this paragraph
27:51 - So let's say that I wanted this word here paragraph to be bolded
27:55 - Well, I can use another special HTML tag, which is the bold tag
27:59 - and this will make this word bow so I can do less than sign and the bold tag is just a B and then
28:06 - You want to end it over here?
28:08 - So inside of these open and closed bold tags
28:11 - We can put any of the text inside of a paragraph or inside of another place in our website
28:16 - That we want to be bold. So now when I refresh this page, you'll see that paragraph is bold
28:21 - I can also use another tag
28:23 - so instead of making it bold we can make it italicize so I could use an eye right here instead of a B and
28:30 - now instead of being bold this text is gonna be italicized and you can actually embed
28:36 - these tags inside one another so I could use the bold tags and the italics tags so over here, I'll take this bold tag and
28:45 - I'll take this other ending bold tag and inside of the bold tags
28:49 - I'm gonna put the italics tags and then I'm gonna put the paragraph and
28:53 - Now we'll have a bold italics
28:57 - Paragraph just like that. So it's just
28:59 - Italicizing one of the words and building with a word at the same time
29:03 - So that's a really great way for you to you know
29:05 - You could italicize certain words or you can bold certain words and it really makes it easy just by using those tags
29:11 - Another thing that we can do is we can control the layout of the document
29:16 - So one of the things with HTML is that it lays out our web pages
29:20 - In a very specific way and I want to kind of show you how that happens
29:24 - so when HTML lays out our web page, it basically takes the layout that we define here inside the body and
29:31 - Displays it over here on the web page
29:33 - So the order that we have the elements here in the document is the order that they're gonna show up on the browser
29:39 - So if I was to cut out this paragraph and paste it up here above the header now my documents
29:47 - Layout and structure will reflect that
29:48 - So now the paragraph is gonna be above the website the website header and then this other paragraphs gonna be below it
29:55 - so the way that you order these
29:58 - Tags inside of HTML is the way that they're gonna show up on the website. And the other thing is HTML doesn't necessarily care about
30:06 - The way that we format this file
30:08 - So in other words HTML doesn't care about the whitespace in other words if I made two
30:13 - Extra lines here. You might think okay
30:15 - Now there's going to be two extra lines between the paragraph and the title, right because there's all this space inside of here
30:21 - But that's actually not the case
30:23 - When I refresh the page nothing happens
30:26 - HTML lays itself out and orders itself out using these tags and so it doesn't care about any of this
30:32 - Whitespace that's inside of our files. It really just cares about what's inside these tags
30:37 - So imagine that we wanted to create some whitespace, right? And I'm just gonna put this header back up here
30:44 - so it's a little bit easier to read I
30:48 - Could actually create a new line so let's say here inside of this after this header - I wanted to make a new line
30:55 - I can use another HTML tag which is called a break and the break tag will basically create a new line in our HTML document
31:03 - so I can just do a lesson sign of BR and then we're gonna do a forward slash and
31:08 - we're gonna do a greater than sign and you'll see now when I refresh this page, there should be a space between
31:15 - The title and between this first paragraph so you can see that we have this space here and you can use as many of these
31:21 - Great tags as you want I can make two of them and now it's gonna be even further down
31:26 - So these break tags can be really good to kind of break things up
31:29 - another tag that I can use is called the horizontal rule tab and the horizontal rule tab will basically give us a
31:37 - Straight line right across the website that's going to help us to separate some of our content
31:42 - So I can make that tag
31:43 - I can say HR and then I'm gonna do a forward slash and
31:48 - I'm gonna do a greater than sign and so you'll notice that this HR tag was a lot like that
31:53 - Br tag that we used before and this is another special type of HTML tag
31:59 - So this is a tag that's called a single tag, right so over here in this header two. We have one tag
32:05 - And then we have this other ending tag, but sometimes they'll be tags
32:09 - For example like this horizontal rule tab where you don't really need two tags
32:13 - Like there's nothing that needs to go inside of them. And so it's just gonna be a single tag and a lot of times
32:19 - With these single tags, you will format them this way
32:22 - so you'll write out the name and then we'll use this ending sign and then you use this greater than sign and
32:27 - Actually in certain cases you can actually just get rid of this forward slash but we're gonna keep it in because it's like technically correct
32:34 - HTML so now you'll see that instead of a break here
32:37 - we're gonna have a horizontal line and this horizontal line is basically just something we could use to break up our
32:43 - Content right you could put you could even put like another one in here and it might style it grace
32:49 - You could have like a double line there whatever and the horizontal rule will go all the way across the page
32:54 - There's also a couple other tags that we can use to control the size of our text. So down here in this paragraph
33:01 - Let's say that we wanted to make one of these words bigger. For example, let's say we wanted to make this bigger right here
33:08 - we can use two tags called big and small and they'll actually make our
33:13 - Text a little bit bigger or smaller. So I
33:16 - can do the big tag here and
33:19 - I'll do the ending tag
33:21 - So this works just like all those other tags where anything that goes inside of this big tag is actually gonna get bigger
33:27 - So now watch this this right here
33:30 - When I refresh my page
33:32 - It's actually gonna get a little bit a little bit bigger and you can see that it did and so I could do the same
33:37 - Thing with this is tag down here. Let's make this bigger as well just to really illustrate this
33:44 - and now when I refresh this page
33:46 - The is tag is also gonna get bigger. So it doesn't get that much bigger, but you can use this to kind of
33:52 - Control how the text looks like. Maybe you want some text to be a little bit bigger or smaller
33:56 - I can do the same thing. But with small tags so here on this my word
34:01 - I'm gonna give this a small tag. So we'll say small and then again, we're gonna end it
34:06 - and
34:08 - Now watch the my right here. This is gonna get smaller. So
34:12 - You can see that it shrunk a little bit
34:14 - so using those big and those small tags can help us to control the size of the text on our website we can also use
34:21 - other tags called subscripts and superscripts
34:24 - So this can be used to format like subscripts and superscripts, especially if you're doing something like math
34:29 - You're gonna want to use something like this. So I'm gonna go over here into this paragraph and
34:34 - we'll create a subscript and a superscript so imagine that I wanted to like type out the
34:40 - chemical formula for water right we could say
34:43 - h2o
34:44 - But this too should actually be a subscript, right
34:48 - it should be like a small little too right down below H so I can use this sub tag and
34:54 - I can surround this too with the sub tag and
34:59 - Now this is gonna be like a little bit smaller. So you'll see here we have h2o
35:04 - So it's formatted correctly. I could also do the same thing with a superscript so
35:10 - Another good example would be like math so I could say like maybe we want to write out 10
35:15 - Squared so like 10 ^ - I can use this superscript
35:22 - Tag and this will make this a superscript
35:27 - So now we have 10 squared
35:28 - So these are all like little HTML tags that you can basically just use to
35:33 - Format the text on your website and when HTML was first written you have to understand that websites were just all textual
35:40 - so nowadays, we have like a bunch of images and videos and all these different things on our web pages, but you know
35:46 - Generally HTML was just used to write out text and there were some images and some other stuff
35:50 - But there's a lot of HTML tags that just deal with
35:54 - formatting your
35:55 - So these are all
35:56 - Tags that can come in handy
35:57 - And you can definitely use them to format text inside of your paragraphs or you can use any of these
36:02 - Tags inside of other elements. So I
36:05 - Don't want you to think you can know that you can only use these tags inside of like a paragraph you can use these tags
36:11 - Anywhere that there's text on your website so we could use these up here in the header or you could use them in any other
36:17 - HTML tag that you want so those are there's some basic tags
36:21 - Obviously there's a bunch of these tags that we can learn and we're gonna get into more of them
36:25 - But what you want to do is really get a handle for the basics
36:28 - And so this is really like the basics of HTML things like headers horizontal rules breaks paragraphs
36:34 - Get a handle for the basics
36:37 - and practice like fleshing out different websites using only these things and then when you move on to more complex
36:43 - HTML you'll be better off for it because you know the fundamentals
36:50 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about comments in HTML
36:54 - Now comments are basically little pieces of text that you can write inside of your HTML
37:00 - Which will be ignored by the browser and generally the purpose of comments is for either yourself to read or for other
37:07 - Developers to read so you can write an HTML comment inside of your HTML code and it'll be completely ignored by the web browser
37:14 - But if for example you come back to your code later
37:17 - you might leave yourself a little reminder or you could explain what a little block of code is doing or
37:23 - If you give your file to another developer, you can use comments to give them little notes now
37:29 - I'm gonna show you how you can use comments inside of HTML and then we're also going to talk about the comments best practice
37:35 - so like how can you use comments the best way in HTML the way that you can create a comment is by
37:43 - using a very particular syntax and so I can create a comment by using a less than sign an
37:49 - exclamation point and then two hyphens
37:51 - and so now you can see here in my text editor that the
37:55 - when I put this second - in here like the look of the comment actually changed and
38:00 - That's because now we're in a comment and so any text that I type is gonna be grayed out
38:04 - So this text looks different from the text out here and basically that's just to indicate that okay
38:10 - We have now an HTML comment
38:13 - One of the things I want to point out is that when I created this comment all the code below it
38:20 - Turned also into this little comment. So now what I'm doing is I'm creating an opening tag for a comment
38:27 - so a comment is gonna go inside of these opening and closing tags and I can close off this comment tag by using a
38:34 - Hyphen, - and a greater than sign
38:36 - So now anything inside of these tags is gonna be a comment and I can run these comments down across multiple lines
38:44 - So I can create comments
38:45 - you know that span a couple different lines in our text and like I said comments are basically just
38:51 - special pieces of text that aren't gonna get rendered by the browser so
38:55 - Generally, the browser's not just gonna not gonna look at them. They're just kind of kind of ignore them and
39:00 - In here, you can just put little so I could say like to do like I need to work on this or I could say
39:09 - You know don't display this, you know, really any comment that you want to put I mean
39:14 - It really doesn't matter but comments can definitely be useful and you're gonna want to know how to use comments
39:19 - You can also use comments to comment out
39:22 - Specific pieces of code. So let's say for example that I didn't want this
39:28 - H2 in this horizontal rule to show up
39:30 - so that's like this header over here my website I could take this and surround it with comments and now this
39:38 - basically just won't show up on my website and
39:41 - You can see because the browser is ignoring it
39:43 - So a lot of times people who write HTML in addition to using comments to like write little notes
39:49 - They'll also just use comments to kind of comment out little pieces of code
39:54 - So it's kind of useful, right?
39:55 - Because none of this code is gonna get rendered by the browser now
39:58 - so if I wanted to maybe try a different piece of code or you know
40:02 - Try something else
40:02 - I can comment this code out and it's still gonna be there inside of the HTML file
40:08 - But it's not gonna get used by the browser
40:10 - and another thing a lot of people will do is they'll put like the reason why they comment about so you can just say like
40:16 - redoing this or something and then you know that would mean like you're
40:19 - Rewriting whatever is in here and you just want to have a backup inside the comment. So that's the basics of comments
40:25 - They're really simple, but they're also really powerful now
40:28 - One word of I guess kind of warning and this is sort of like me just talking like with my personal opinion
40:35 - I think when you're using comments, you need to use them sparingly
40:39 - I think some people have a bad habit of just writing out like all of these, you know
40:45 - Really long comments explaining things and doing things, you know personally
40:50 - I think the purpose of a comment is is to explain something that can't be explained with code
40:56 - So just sometimes people will write like a bunch of messy code
40:59 - So they'll write out a bunch of messy
41:01 - HTML and then it'll just write a comment above it being like oh it does this like oh, this is the header
41:06 - Meanwhile, the code is like, you know a complete disaster. It's really messy
41:10 - I'm a big believer in letting the HTML speak for itself
41:14 - And I think it's a decent philosophy to adopt
41:17 - You know when you let the HTML speak for itself
41:20 - You make sure that you write clean and readable
41:23 - HTML and that way when somebody goes to view your HTML document they don't even need any
41:28 - Comments to explain anything because it's all clear
41:30 - You know what?
41:32 - You don't want to be as the guy who writes a bunch of messy code writes a comment telling what it does
41:36 - Because it doesn't help anyone out
41:37 - Right. Sure
41:38 - The comments telling me what this line of code is doing but it doesn't help me if I need to go in there or modify
41:43 - It so before you use a comment try to explain what you're doing
41:48 - using your HTML comments are used for things that can't be explained with the HTML and they can also be used like I said to
41:55 - Comment out lines of code and you know put things on hold for a second hide them from the browser, you know
42:00 - Really? This is all just kind of my opinion and me kind of riffing about comments, but use comments, however you want and
42:06 - Be sure to add them into your HTML files to increase your productivity
42:14 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about styles and colors
42:18 - one of the cool things you can do in HTML is you can actually style the individual elements and when you style
42:26 - HTML elements you can use something called a style attribute and you can actually
42:32 - Give each of these HTML elements certain styling information
42:36 - Now when we're talking about styling HTML
42:39 - There's an entire other subject that you can get into which is called CSS and that stands for cascading
42:46 - Style sheet. So in this lesson
42:48 - I just want to kind of give you an introduction into how you can use basic CSS to style
42:54 - Some of these HTML elements now
42:56 - This isn't a meant to be a full course on CSS
43:00 - And in fact, this draft Academy course is really only meant to be used for HTML
43:05 - We have another course that talks solely about CSS, but just know for now. I want to introduce you to the topic of
43:12 - styling some of your HTML
43:15 - You can see over here. I have this header up here
43:18 - And then I have this paragraph here in my file and I can actually give these two color attributes
43:25 - I can color the text and I can actually give them a background color as well
43:30 - So in this lesson, I'm going to show you how you can start adding some basic colors onto the elements for your HTML
43:37 - But again, keep in mind that this isn't meant to be like a full course on CSS
43:40 - This isn't meant to be a full course on styling. I just want to give you guys an introduction
43:45 - So in here in this paragraph I can pass this paragraph in attribute
43:50 - So in HTML in addition to just defining the tag, you can also give the HTML tag certain information
43:57 - These are called like attributes or properties or some people call them parameters
44:02 - I'm gonna give this something called
44:05 - Style, so I type out style is equal to and now inside of these quotation marks
44:10 - I can type out some different style attributes that I want to give to this element
44:15 - One of them is color and color is going to control the color of the text for this paragraph
44:22 - I can do a colon and now I can basically just type out any color that I want
44:27 - So let's use blue because that's one of my favorite colors
44:31 - So now when I refresh this page, you'll notice that this paragraph over here has turned blue
44:37 - And so instead of just being that boring black color now, it's blue we could also change it to red
44:43 - and
44:45 - Now it will be red so you can use a bunch of these different colors and you can change the color of the text
44:52 - I could also change something called background color
44:55 - so in addition to changing the color to red, let's change the background color to
45:01 - Maybe blue so now I can type out
45:04 - background
45:05 - - color and I can pass in another color. So let's make this blue
45:10 - And so now this paragraph will have its text colored as red and it'll have its background colored as blue
45:17 - Just like that. And so you can use these different color combinations to control the background of the text and
45:24 - the color of the text and you can also use these attributes and other elements so
45:30 - For example, I could use this same thing inside of this header right here. I could say
45:35 - Style, I remember this is just a an attribute that we're passing in I can say color and now we'll make this green
45:44 - So I can make this thing green and I can also use these stylings on these container tags
45:50 - So up here. We have this body tag
45:53 - I could give this a style as well so I can say style and why don't we give this a background color?
45:59 - so I'm gonna give this a background color of
46:02 - Light blue, so I'll say background
46:06 - color
46:08 - light blue and
46:10 - Now what you'll see is the entire body. So the entire body of our HTML
46:15 - So all this stuff is gonna turn blue and that's exactly what happens so you can use this
46:21 - Background color inside of this body tag to control the background of the website
46:26 - And what you'll notice is even though we made the background of the body
46:30 - light blue
46:32 - Since we made the background of this paragraph blue as well
46:35 - It's overriding the styling that we from the body
46:38 - so that's how you can use this style attribute in order to give your
46:43 - HTML elements some basic style and if you want to learn more about styling your elements
46:48 - JAF Academy has a full course talking about CSS where we get into all of this stuff styling your HTML doing all that
46:55 - But for now if you're just trying to learn HTML and I would definitely recommend learning HTML first
47:00 - Just know that you can use these basic coloring styles to change the look in the field of your website
47:06 - Now I want to show you a website where you can go to to find all of the colors that you can use. So
47:12 - this is a website called w3 schools and you can just kind of google search like w3 schools color list and
47:19 - It'll give you a list of all these CSS colors. So again, don't worry too much about CSS
47:24 - Just know that you can use these inside of those style tags
47:26 - So this is just a full list of like the name of the color and if you don't want to pass in the name
47:32 - So like I could say like aqua inside one of those style tags and it would color the text of the background aqua
47:38 - You can also just put these hex tags in there
47:41 - So you could copy this guy and put it in place of the color name and it's still gonna work
47:46 - So that's just some basics on
47:49 - Using color and styling in HTML again. If you're just trying to learn HTML, don't worry too much about
47:54 - styling, but I just wanted to show you guys like the basics of styling an element just so you can kind of like get your
48:00 - teeth wet and start working with
48:03 - styling inside of your HTML
48:08 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about using various HTML tags to layout the
48:15 - structure of your website
48:17 - Now we've looked at some of these basic HTML tags things like body and this HTML tag
48:23 - We also looked at things like headers and paragraphs all these very basic HTML
48:28 - Tags in this tutorial. I want to talk to you about tags that we can use to format the content on our page
48:35 - so these tags are gonna help us to lay out the different content on our website into different sections and
48:42 - Really when we're writing HTML you want to make sure that you're using the right?
48:46 - tags to layout your page one of the most common mistakes that new
48:50 - Developers to HTML make is that they don't use the correct tags and they don't use all of the HTML tags that they have
48:57 - Available to them to layout their pages
48:59 - A lot of times people won't use the right tags
49:02 - Or they won't lay out their pages as well as they could because maybe they don't know about certain HTML tags
49:08 - Or they just don't feel like taking the time to use them
49:11 - But in this tutorial, I want to show you all the tags that you should be using to layout your web pages
49:17 - so
49:18 - The first thing I want to show you is how you can start laying out some of the code inside of your body
49:23 - Now most web pages are gonna have three
49:27 - distinct sections
49:29 - normally, there's a header and the header is like up at the top and generally the header is an element that's on every page of
49:35 - Your website so this could be like a navigation menu
49:38 - Maybe it has some branding information
49:40 - So it has like the name of the website and maybe a logo and you'd have links to like other parts of your websites
49:46 - I mean you guys have seen a website before you kind of know what a header of a website is supposed to look like
49:50 - The next section is the main section. So this is like the meat and the bones of the website, right?
49:55 - This is where all the content is going to go
49:57 - So maybe you have would have like an article you might have different sections of an article some images. Whatever
50:03 - It's like the main
50:05 - section of the website and the third section is the footer and most websites are gonna have a footer right if you scroll all the
50:10 - Way down to the bottom. There's some additional navigational links again. Maybe some branding information
50:16 - May be links to like some social media pages most websites though are gonna implement basic three
50:23 - Section structure the header the main and the footer and HTML has tags that we can use to
50:30 - Define all of those sections so here inside my body
50:33 - I'm gonna start by defining the header and I can just make a
50:37 - Header tag just like this and we'll make two of them
50:41 - and so now any of the code that we want to put in the header of our website is gonna go up in here and
50:48 - Now over here, I'm gonna make a mane and so we have these other tags mane
50:53 - And what you want to do is put all the main content of your website inside of here
50:59 - And finally, we can have the last one which is the footer tag
51:03 - so footer and again
51:05 - I'm just gonna close this off footer so we have this basic three tag layout
51:11 - We have the header. We have the main and we have the footer and these are all sibling elements
51:17 - So they're all they all have the same parent element
51:21 - Which is this body tag and a good practice whenever you're using HTML is to separate the code for these specific area
51:28 - So you want to put all the code for the header of your website?
51:30 - Inside the header tags for the main inside the main tags in the footer inside the footer tags
51:35 - Inside of these different tags we can also define
51:39 - Certain things so imagine that inside of my header tag. I had a
51:44 - navigation menu right a lot of times in a header of a website they'll be
51:48 - Navigation links, so it'll be like here's the home page
51:50 - Then the about page Contact Us page, whatever we would want to put any of those
51:55 - Navigational elements inside of something called a nav tag and this nav tag is used to store navigational elements
52:02 - So if you had like, you know a list of different links inside your website
52:07 - Then you could put them here inside of these nav tag now
52:11 - Obviously the point of this video isn't to show you like how to build a navigation tag or a navigation list
52:16 - I just want to show you what you would need to use for a structure
52:19 - So I'm showing you like how to structure this information. So any
52:23 - navigational items like maybe navigational lists or navigational links are gonna go inside of
52:30 - Have tags and that's a special tag inside of HTML. There's also some other tags that we could use inside of this main
52:35 - So imagine that I had like a blog website and on my blog website. I had a bunch of blog posts
52:41 - Well, one thing I could do would be to use what's called an article tag
52:46 - So I can make an article tag and then inside of those article tags
52:50 - I could write my blog post so I can make a tag called article and
52:55 - Down here. We're just gonna close this and
52:58 - So inside of these article tags, you could put all the text for your article and then the browser would know like, okay
53:05 - There's gonna be an article inside of here. We can also use another tag, which is called a section
53:10 - so
53:11 - generally
53:11 - if you're writing a blog you might have like
53:13 - Different sections on your website and so we can use this section tag to break up our article or really any part of your website
53:21 - into different sections
53:22 - So once again, the section tags don't have to be used with the article tag
53:26 - but they just happen to go together really well and that's on purpose so I could say section and
53:33 - We can close this off and then any of the code for like the first section of your blog post could go in here and
53:39 - Maybe I'll have another section
53:44 - And again, we can just close this off so you can make as many of these section containers as you want
53:50 - You can put all of the content for this section of your website
53:52 - And usually whenever you have a different section, you'd want to include a header for the section so you can clewd
53:59 - Like an h1 or h2 or h3, whatever
54:03 - Header that you'd want to have now
54:05 - I also want to talk to you guys about using headers inside of your HTML
54:09 - documents and this isn't something that is required to do but
54:13 - Generally if you're laying out an HTML page or an HTML article
54:18 - You want to be careful with how you're using your headers?
54:20 - So generally on a web page you want to have one header one and that header one will be like the main
54:26 - Title for the website and then below that header one you would have header twos which is define the different sections of your website
54:33 - So you might have this
54:34 - Top header one and then you'd have header twos and then you have another header two down here and then if you wanted another header
54:41 - Side one of those sections you would use a header three
54:44 - So a lot of times people will recommend using headers in like a hierarchy fashion
54:50 - So you'd want to have like a header 1 and then header 2?
54:55 - header 2 and
54:58 - Then inside of here like another header 3
55:01 - So you'd want to define the headers of your website in this kind of like hierarchy fashion
55:05 - And that's not required like it's not going to change the performance of your website if you don't do that
55:09 - But that's sort of like a best
55:11 - Practice that a lot of people a lot of developers are going to use when they're designing their websites
55:16 - And since we're talking about laying out like the structure of the website
55:19 - I think that's good information to take the heart another tag that we can use to help lay out
55:23 - Our websites is called in a side tag and then a side tag is basically a tag that you can use for any content
55:30 - That's not directly
55:32 - Related to like the main content on the page
55:34 - And a good example of a scenario where you'd want to use in a side tag might be like an advertisement
55:40 - So a lot of websites will have advertisements like you might be using Google Adsense or you know
55:46 - Whatever like if you have an advertisement on your website, you could use and a side tag to define that and the aside tag
55:53 - Basically would just mean like this content is on the page and it's getting shown to the users
56:00 - But it's not directly related to like the core content of our website
56:04 - so those are just a bunch of different tags that you can use to help layout your website and I would
56:09 - Definitely consider using the tags when you're building the basic structure of your website
56:14 - one thing that a lot of people end up doing is they'll just sort of use like
56:18 - general container tags to lay out their website
56:21 - so they won't use the
56:22 - specific HTML tags that HTML has defined for them to lay out their website and one of the advantages of
56:29 - using these tags of you know
56:31 - specifying like this is the section of my website and this is another section of my website because you might say like
56:36 - Why do I have to define all those sections and honestly?
56:39 - like using tags
56:40 - like this isn't necessarily gonna change the look and the feel of your website like
56:45 - you could create a header a main and a footer for your website without using the header the
56:51 - Or the footer tags, the purpose of those tags is one to act for organizations
56:56 - So if you are writing an HTML file one of your goal should be to make the file as readable as possible
57:02 - So when you write the file you want it to be able to be read by
57:05 - either yourself later on or other developers and when you use these
57:10 - HTML tags these structure tags
57:12 - It makes it a lot easier to tell what's going on
57:15 - Right so I can look at your HTML and I can tell like okay. Here's the header. Oh, here's the main
57:20 - So this is where like all of the core content is. Okay. Here's the article and I need to go to the second section
57:26 - Here's the second section. It just makes it easier to
57:29 - Read the file and it just makes the organization more organized and again these tags
57:34 - These structural tags aren't necessarily going to change the look or the feel of the website, but they're extremely useful another reason
57:42 - they're useful is for search engine optimization and search engine optimization is
57:47 - Basically, just how your website is viewed by
57:51 - Search engines. So a lot of well, there's actually more to it than that
57:54 - But that's sort of like the basic idea is like if your site has good search engine optimization
57:59 - Then it'll be really easy for search engines like Google
58:02 - To be able to go read through your site and figure out what it's about and when you use these very specific
58:08 - HTML tags
58:09 - It makes it a lot easier for something like Google to go into your website and figure out the structure of your website and figure
58:15 - Out where all of the content of your website is when you use these HTML tags
58:19 - Something like Google could easily go into your file and figure out like where the article is and it can figure out the different
58:25 - sections of your website and you can figure out like
58:27 - How your website is laid out and then it can use that information to display your website better
58:33 - A lot of people underestimate the power of these HTML tags
58:37 - And so I want to kind of instill in you guys who are watching this video the power that these tags can have you?
58:43 - Definitely want to use things like this to layout your websites
58:46 - Don't listen to people who tell you that they're not important because they definitely are important
58:50 - That's the reason that they're included in HTML hTML is a no-nonsense language. There's not a whole lot of fluff in there
58:56 - So when HTML define something, you know that it's important
59:00 - anyway
59:00 - I would always recommend laying out your files
59:03 - something like this you
59:04 - These different tags if you don't want to you don't want to but I think it takes a little extra time
59:09 - But it can really increase the readability and also the possibility of your file by like search engine
59:17 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about using links in
59:21 - HTML a link is one of the most popular HTML elements and it's used to
59:26 - link your website to other websites on the internet so I could create a link that would bring my users to like google.com or
59:34 - Facebook.com or I could link to other pages on my website
59:38 - So if I wanted to build like a navigational list
59:41 - I could have links to the other pages of my website that users could click and then they go to those pages you can also
59:47 - Link to files things like images or PDFs and you can create those links and then users can look at those images or PDFs
59:55 - So I'm gonna show you how to create a link. We need to use a special HTML tag called a and
60:02 - After a we need to pass this tag some information
60:05 - We need to give it something called an H ref and the href is basically just where we want to link to
60:11 - so the easiest way to create a link would be to create like an external link, so
60:17 - Linking to a page that's not on our website. Imagine. We wanted to create a link that would go to like google.com
60:23 - inside of this href I can just type the address to google.com so I can say
60:28 - HTTP colon forward slash forward slash and you need to make sure that you include this like
60:34 - HTTP or
60:36 - HTTPS part a lot of times when you will give someone a link like you won't include this it would just be like
60:41 - ww-whatever
60:42 - But when you're creating an href and you're creating a link, you need to be very specific about where you want to go
60:48 - So you're going to need to include this part and then I can just type
60:53 - Wwm so what we've effectively done is told this link attribute that we want it to link to this address
61:01 - which is Google and now I'll close this and I can actually
61:05 - close off this entire tag so we can just make this closing a tag and now inside of here I can put any
61:12 - Text for this link so we could say for example
61:15 - Google's homepage now. I also just want to point out that inside of these link tags
61:21 - You can put more than just text so you don't have to just put text you could actually put other
61:26 - HTML elements so I could put like a header in here. For example
61:30 - so why don't we do that will make this a header one and
61:34 - Now when I refresh my page, you'll see that we have this big old link over here
61:39 - it's this big header one and when we click on it, it will link us to
61:43 - google.com so I'm gonna click this and you'll see that we get transported over to
61:48 - Google's homepage, right? So we're over here on Google
61:52 - so that's how you can create a link and basically you can just go to any website that you want come up here to the
61:58 - URL bar copy the URL
62:00 - Including this like HTTP or HTTPS part throw it into the href of your link and you'll be able to link there
62:07 - There's one other thing that we can do though
62:09 - One thing I want you to notice is when I click this link it navigates me away from the website
62:14 - So I click this and all of a sudden we're on Google in certain cases, though
62:19 - You're not gonna want users to navigate away from your website when they click a link right in certain cases
62:25 - You might want this to open up for example in a new tab and the way that you can do that is by giving
62:31 - this a
62:33 - tag another attribute so we can say
62:37 - We want to say target is equal to and now inside of these quotation marks
62:42 - We want to say underscore the link. Ok
62:45 - So when you pass in this underscore blank value to this target attribute
62:50 - This is gonna basically tell the browser to open up this link in a new tab
62:55 - So now when we open up Google it's going to open up here in a new tab and we still have our website open
63:02 - So that's one thing that you can do to make this better
63:05 - And so again inside of this link I can put any HTML elements that I want so I could put like an h1
63:12 - Maybe we wanted to like make this homepage bold. We could put a bold tag in here and
63:17 - You can really like get creative and like style these different links different ways
63:22 - you want to so don't be afraid to put
63:24 - HTML elements inside of these a tags because it's definitely something that you're gonna want to do
63:30 - Another thing that we can do is we can link to other pages on our website
63:34 - So I'm gonna get rid of the text for that link
63:36 - I'm also going to get rid of this target blank
63:38 - And if you look over here in my file explorer my little file tree, you can see that in addition to this index.html
63:46 - File which is the file that we're using right now
63:49 - I also have this page - dot HTML and this page three dot HTML and these are both just like other
63:57 - Web pages that are on my website. So any given website is gonna have a number of web pages
64:02 - you might have like an about page a
64:04 - Contact me page if it's a blog you might have a bunch of like blog articles
64:08 - You get the point a lot of times you're gonna have more than one HTML file for your website
64:13 - And we can actually link between those files and you can use this link attribute to do that
64:19 - So in here in this href instead of linking to Google using this like absolute address I can link to those pages on my website
64:26 - using a relative URL
64:29 - So if I wanted to access this page - for example, let's say that I wanted to link to page two
64:35 - Because the page that I'm currently on and page two are in the same directory
64:40 - I can just type out page twos name so down here I can just say like
64:45 - Page two dot HTML and the browser will automatically know that we want to go here to page two
64:52 - so over here I can just tell you page two and
64:57 - Now in the browser you'll see that we have a link to page two
65:02 - So when I click this it'll bring me over here to page two and you'll notice that inside of page two
65:07 - I've already set up a link inside of here. So here in page two
65:11 - I have another link which is just linking me back to index dot HTML and this is a way that we can create
65:19 - navigation on our site
65:20 - So now I'm over here in page two and I can navigate back to the home page so I can navigate between these two pages
65:27 - on my website I
65:29 - Can also create another link to page 3 so let's do that right here below this page two
65:36 - will make another link this time to page three and
65:40 - One thing you want to notice is that page three is inside of this directory
65:44 - So page three is inside of a folder called dyrone if I want a link to page three
65:49 - I can't just say page three dot HTML
65:53 - Because the browser's not going to know
65:56 - Where this page three is supposed to be we have to tell it exactly where it is
66:00 - relative to the current file that we're on so I can say
66:04 - der one forward slash page three and what this is going to say is
66:09 - We want to go to directory one and we want to link to a page inside of directory one called page three dot HTML
66:16 - So now we should have a link to page three and you can see that showed up right here
66:21 - I can click this and it'll bring us to page three
66:24 - So that's a way that you can link to different pages on your website. You can also create links to files on your website
66:32 - so in our case
66:33 - we just have this little cat picture and this is just kind of like a cute cat and we could actually
66:38 - Link to this picture of the cat on our website, so I'm going to go over here into my index file
66:45 - and we can access this picture the same way that we've been accessing these HTML files so I can just say
66:53 - Instead of dyrone the cat pictures at the same directory so I can just say cat and it's a jpg file so dot jpg
67:02 - Having change this to cat
67:04 - And now I should have a link to this cat picture
67:08 - So I click this it'll bring me to this picture of the cat and I can look at the cat
67:12 - So that's kind of how you can link to
67:15 - external websites other pages on your website and files on your website
67:21 - so in addition to a jpg
67:22 - I could also link to like a PDF or a word document if I had it stored on my website
67:26 - It doesn't matter and that's one of the basics of using links in HTML
67:34 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about using images on your website
67:39 - One of the most common things people want to do when they have a website is put images up there
67:43 - and so today I'm gonna show you the basics of working with images we can talk about
67:48 - Resizing images and basically just placing them on our HTML pages
67:53 - So I'm going to create an image tag down here and an image tag is basically just less than sign. I am G and
68:01 - inside this image tag
68:02 - we actually have to give it a couple pieces of information the first thing we want to give this image tag is the
68:09 - location of the image that we want to show so when you have this image tag
68:13 - You have to basically link it to an actual image
68:16 - And then the HTML will be smart enough to go grab that image and then place it on our web site
68:21 - So I can just say source SRC is equal to and then these quotation marks and inside of these quotation marks
68:29 - We want to put the location of the image
68:31 - Now one of the most basic ways to do this is to link to an image that's on the internet
68:37 - So there's a lot of images on the Internet obviously and we can actually just put the address for an image inside of this source
68:43 - Tag and it'll link us to that image so over here my browser
68:46 - I just have some pictures of dinosaurs and there's a bunch of dinosaurs here
68:52 - here's like a t-rex like really scary so I can just view this image and
68:57 - You can see up here that this image has like an address associated to it, right?
69:02 - So this image is like, you know, obviously it's like this crazy address, but I can copy the address to this image
69:08 - And then I can just paste it onto
69:12 - this source attribute so I can just paste that bad boy right in here and we got this awesome image and so
69:20 - When we want to use an image in addition to specifying the source, I can also specify one more attribute
69:27 - Which is called alt and the alt attribute is basically what's gonna show up if the image can't be found
69:34 - so one of the problems that sometimes you'll run into when you're making your
69:38 - HTML is that an image that you're linking to is like either?
69:42 - Deleted or it's not there or it can't be loaded by the browser. So for example if this
69:48 - The scary dinosaur ever like disappeared like if that person took it off of their website
69:53 - Then it wouldn't show up anymore. And so we have this alt tag as like a backup
69:58 - So whatever text you put inside this
70:00 - alt tag
70:00 - will show up if the image doesn't show up and also it's a good practice always to just have an alt tag and you want
70:07 - to make this like maybe one sentence that's like pretty descriptive so I could just say like a really
70:12 - scary
70:14 - Dino, and now this is like describing the image and sort of like plain text
70:19 - So always want to make sure you have an alt tag and when we have an image, it's just gonna be a single tag
70:24 - So a lot of times an HTML will have like two tags like a starting tag in an ending tag
70:29 - And we'll put some stuff inside of there not the case with an image
70:32 - We can just do this forward slash and we can do a greater than sign and now the tag is gonna be done
70:38 - So it's just a single image tag just like this and obviously it's a pretty long URL
70:43 - Now what this should do is it should go out grab this image and display it on our website and that's exactly what happens
70:50 - So this dino is actually like pretty big you can see
70:53 - Super scary, but now we have this image on our website so we can link to this image
71:00 - Another thing that we can do is link to images that are on our actual computer
71:05 - So instead of linking to an image that's on the internet
71:08 - I can just link to an image maybe that I have like
71:11 - You know for myself
71:13 - So I'm gonna get rid of this source here and I have this image on my little file tree over here
71:19 - it's just this cute cat and
71:21 - I can actually take this cat picture and insert it into my website just like I did with that picture from the internet
71:28 - So inside the source, I'm just gonna link to the image of the cat. So we're just gonna be cat dot jpg and
71:36 - now I'll change the alt so we can just change it from like a really scary dinosaur to really cute cat and
71:43 - When I refresh my page, we'll have the cat picture
71:47 - so one of the problems that you might be noticing with the dinosaur picture
71:51 - and now with this cat picture is that
71:53 - They're kind of big right like this is kind of like a big image and especially that dinosaur picture
71:58 - That was huge took up like the entire Green
72:01 - So one of the things you can do with images is resize them and we can give this image tag a couple more attributes
72:08 - so in addition to defining the source and
72:10 - defining the alt text we can also define a width and a height and the width and the height will control the size of the
72:17 - Image so I can give this a whiff
72:20 - You know
72:20 - I could say actually it's gonna be equal to and
72:23 - we can say maybe like a hundred and we can give it a height and
72:27 - This will be a hundred right so when we kind of shrink it down a little bit and these like 100 what that means is
72:34 - 100 pixels a
72:35 - Pixel is a unit of measurement that we can use in HTML basically like defines
72:42 - sizes and a pixel is kind of hard to explain like how big it is because it's not a
72:48 - Standard unit in other words a pixel could be a different size
72:52 - Depending on the resolution of the screen that you're looking at
72:55 - So a hundred pixels, you know for the most part it's gonna be kind of the same distance on most web pages
73:02 - But it's not like an absolute distance of measurement like a centimeter or an inch
73:07 - so just keep that in mind so I can say a hundred pixel width and a hundred pixel height and
73:12 - Now when I refresh my page the cat is a little bit smaller, right so we can see it a little bit better
73:18 - But we have another problem which is that the cat looks
73:21 - horrible, right
73:22 - I mean it's kind of like smooshed in a little bit and
73:24 - you'll notice if I get rid of this within the height that I'm actually
73:29 - Changing the aspect ratio of the image. So now refresh this you see the image is actually like wider than it is tall. So
73:37 - When you're defining a different width and a height for an image
73:41 - You want to be sure to keep the same aspect ratio?
73:44 - What you can do is you can figure out what the aspect ratio of your image is so over here in this cat
73:50 - jpg
73:51 - you can see down here that the aspect ratio for this image is 300 by 200 so it's like
73:59 - 300 pixels by 200 pixels so it has like so it has a 300 by 200
74:04 - You know aspect ratio or whatever and we can just keep that same aspect ratio
74:10 - inside of our within our height, so put these back in so if it's
74:15 - 300 by 200 we could make it
74:18 - 100 by 66 and this should give us the
74:23 - Correct, like aspect ratio, right? That's the same ratio as 300 to 200
74:28 - So now when I resize the image, it looks great, right?
74:31 - It's just it's a little bit smaller, but it's the same dimensions like it's the same aspect ratio. So
74:37 - That's kind of how you can resize your images
74:48 - You
74:54 - And you can also use other things with images so I could combine this image with a link for example
75:01 - so I could come over here and we can create a link tag and
75:05 - we just say hey and we give this an href and
75:09 - Inside here. I could put like whatever
75:12 - Link that I wanted to for. So for example, I could link this to like this dinosaur picture
75:17 - alright put the URL for the dinosaur in there and
75:23 - We can close off this link and now when I click on the image
75:28 - It will bring me to that picture of the dinosaur so you can make these images like clickable
75:33 - You can really do a lot of stuff with these images and you can embed them inside of other
75:37 - HTML tags so I could put like an image inside of other HTML tags, you know
75:41 - you can put them anywhere you want and
75:43 - images are super powerful and you're definitely gonna want to make sure that you use them on your website and you always want to make
75:49 - Sure that you include this all attribute. This is really important
75:52 - A lot of people get lazy and they don't put it in there, but it's really important
75:55 - and for example
75:57 - if I was to get rid of this cat jpg here and the source you'll see that now what it does is it just
76:04 - Gives me that alt text so it's really important. Just so your website Conte stays together in the case. That an image link is broken
76:14 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about using videos on your website
76:18 - so I'm gonna show you how you can take a video that you have saved on your computer and
76:23 - Put it into your website and then I'm also gonna show you how you can include a YouTube video into your website
76:29 - So let's start with a normal video over here
76:33 - I have this
76:34 - tutorial dot mp4 video and this is just like one of the
76:37 - tutorials that I did for traffic Adam II and I want to include this on my website so I can actually use the
76:43 - HTML video tag and it's just going to be video just like this and I'm going to give this an attribute called source
76:51 - So it's gonna be SRC as equal to and then inside of these quotation marks
76:56 - I want to type in the location of the video. So the relative path to the video from the current file in my case
77:03 - it's just
77:04 - tutorial dot P for and then I can close off this video tag and
77:11 - We're actually gonna need an ending video tag as well
77:14 - Now one thing you might want to do is put some text inside of these video tags
77:19 - And this is text that's gonna show up if the users browser can't display like videos in a certain format
77:26 - This is kind of rare like most browsers are gonna be able to display video
77:30 - But just know that any text that you put in here will get displayed if the video fails for any reason
77:36 - So if I go over here to my website
77:38 - I can refresh the page and you'll notice that the video is gonna show up and it shows up
77:44 - But the problem is if I click on this video, I can't actually play it, right
77:49 - So I keep clicking in the videos not playing and that's because we haven't given this video any video controls
77:55 - So I can come down here and I can actually just give this another attribute called
77:59 - Controls and as long as we type controls in here now
78:03 - This video will be able to have video controls
78:06 - so
78:07 - sometimes you might just want to like store a video on your website and you don't want anyone to watch it or whatever and you
78:12 - Can just use that normal video tag, but if you want them to be able to control the video
78:16 - they need these so now we can click the play button and
78:19 - You can see I'm watching the video I can skip to different parts in the video
78:23 - Over here I can control like the volume I can make get full screen or whatever
78:27 - So now we have like full control over this video. Another thing I can do is control the size of the video, so you
78:36 - Can notice the video is a little bit big if I wanted to give this a different size
78:40 - I can do that so I can give this two attributes a width and I can also give it a height
78:46 - Now one trick is you want to keep the aspect ratio of the video?
78:51 - So I'm just gonna give this a width and the height will
78:55 - automatically adjust to fit whatever width I'm using so we can give this a width of like
79:01 - 300 and this is gonna be 300 pixels. So now when I refresh the page the video is gonna be 300 pixels
79:08 - so it's a little bit smaller a little bit easier for me to see and you can
79:12 - Control the width and the height by just using this width property. Another thing I can do is control the thumbnail of the video
79:19 - So you'll notice that when I refresh the page, it just gives me like a picture of like the first scene of the video
79:26 - but if I have a specific thumbnail, I can also use that on here so over here I can just say
79:33 - poster and inside of these quotation marks
79:36 - I can basically pass this an image file
79:39 - so over here
79:40 - I have this thumbnail image and this is actually the thumbnail for that image on YouTube
79:45 - so I can actually open up my index dot HTML file again, and I can just put in here that
79:51 - thumb dot
79:53 - Jpg image and now when I refresh my page, it's gonna use that thumbnail for the video
79:58 - So actually let me make this a little bit bigger
80:00 - So instead of just showing the first scene of the video like the first image from the video
80:05 - It's actually gonna give me that thumbnail and that can be really useful
80:08 - Another thing you can do is specify whether or not you want this to autoplay so I could say over here
80:14 - Autoplay, and now when I open this page the video is gonna automatically start playing so I can kind of like be useful in certain
80:21 - circumstances you can also tell this to loop so I can say loop here and now
80:28 - When the video is finished playing like if we went all the way to the end of the video
80:33 - It's actually just gonna loop back around so it'll loop around and start playing once it gets to the end so you can see
80:40 - When I got it all the way to the end here it started looping around
80:44 - So those are a couple of the little you know
80:46 - Attributes that you can pass it and there's a couple more I'm not going to get into all of them
80:49 - so that's how you can take a video that's just like stored locally on your computer and put
80:54 - It on your webpage now in addition to doing that. You can also include YouTube videos
81:00 - so this is something that a lot of people are probably gonna want to do a lot of videos are stored on YouTube and you
81:05 - Want to just like include them into your website and YouTube actually makes that really easy so over here
81:09 - I just have this dinosaur video and if I wanted to
81:13 - Embed this dinosaur video onto my website. I can actually just come down here to YouTube
81:20 - And I can click this share button and then down here. There should be an option to embed. So
81:27 - over here it will allow me to
81:29 - Click embed so I can click that and this is actually gonna give me some HTML code so you can see over here
81:36 - This is an HTML tag. It's called an iframe
81:39 - And basically what the iframe tag does is it allows you to like peek into another website?
81:44 - So this will like load up the youtubes website into our website and it'll like center around that video
81:50 - I'm gonna make an entire HTML video just talking about iframes. So don't worry too much about that right now
81:56 - just know that you can copy this code and then we can paste it in and
82:01 - YouTube actually gives you options so you can like uncheck or check these different options and it'll
82:06 - Show a player controls or show the video title and other actions
82:10 - so I'm just gonna copy this and now we can come over here into our
82:15 - HTML
82:16 - and we can just paste all this code in and
82:21 - we'll be able to use the YouTube video and one of the cool things about these YouTube videos is you have all of the
82:26 - YouTube player controls so like I have like the fullscreen YouTube button. I have like the YouTube volume button and all that stuff
82:33 - So it looks really nice if you're just embedding a video from YouTube
82:38 - and with these videos you can also change the width and the height so you can modify both of these values and
82:44 - Make them bigger or smaller. So that's the basics of using videos
82:47 - I think that covers most of the use cases either you have a video
82:52 - That you want to put on your website or you want to put a YouTube video on your website?
82:55 - That's kind of how you can do both of those things
83:01 - In this tutorial
83:01 - I want to talk to you about creating lists in HTML
83:05 - Now HTML allows you to list out a group of items and it provides you with a couple different tags to do that
83:12 - there's a lot of scenarios where you might need to list something out maybe a list of names or the list of steps in a
83:18 - Recipe and you can use specific tags in HTML to format those lists and make them look really good
83:25 - like I said
83:26 - There's a couple different types of Lists that we can define and I'm gonna show you
83:29 - Basically how you can define a list?
83:30 - The first type of Lists is called an unordered list and this is a list that doesn't have a particular order. So
83:37 - imagine you we're making a list of just like a bunch of different items and they didn't have to go in a specific order you
83:43 - Can make an unordered list
83:44 - So we're just gonna type ul and then we're also gonna need a closing tag
83:48 - And we're gonna close that off inside of this unordered list. We can define items for the list
83:54 - So these two tags are basically like a container for the list and inside of here. We're gonna create something called a list item
84:01 - So for each item in the list, we're gonna need this
84:05 - Collection of tags which is to list item tags and in here we can just write out what we want them to be
84:11 - So I could write out like a list of fruits for example
84:14 - so we could say apples oranges and
84:18 - Bananas
84:19 - right, so I'm listing out a bunch of different fruits and
84:23 - If I wanted to I could even make these list items a little bit more complex. So I
84:29 - could include something in here like a link so I can make a link and we could
84:33 - give it an href and I'm not actually gonna give this a real address just because I
84:38 - don't need to and then I can close off this link so you can put like
84:43 - HTML tags inside of these lists items you can really do whatever you want inside of there
84:47 - Now when I refresh the page, you'll notice that we have this awesome list
84:50 - so it's listing out all of these items and you can see this one's a link and
84:54 - Because this is an unordered list. We have these little circle markers that just marks each list item in the list
85:01 - So that's how you can define an unordered list, but what if you want to order the items inside of this list?
85:07 - Right, imagine that you were writing the recipe or something in a recipe. You need to follow steps very
85:14 - Specifically so you can't just skip to like any step you want
85:18 - We get to find an ordered list and in an ordered list
85:21 - We just type oh L and that's gonna stand for ordered list
85:24 - And now what you'll see is all of the items in this list are going to be ordered
85:29 - So its ordered like 1 2 3 so there you know
85:33 - there's a specific order assigned to each element and that
85:36 - Order is basically just the order that these list items appear inside of the ordered list
85:41 - And you can actually change the style of lists. So you notice that we were listing everything out with numbers
85:47 - I can actually change that so I can say type and we can specify a type
85:52 - so the default type is gonna be one just like this but instead of 1 I could say a and
85:58 - capital a is gonna mean that
86:00 - It's just listening it out in alphabetical. So we have like a B and C
86:05 - I can also do a lowercase a and that's gonna be lowercase numbers
86:09 - I can do
86:10 - Uppercase I and this is going to be Roman numerals or I could do a lowercase I and it'll be lowercase Roman numerals
86:17 - So you can change around the style of the list depending on the type of items that you have inside
86:23 - You can also embed these lists so I could put a list inside of a list item
86:29 - So let's put a list inside of this oranges and we could just put another
86:34 - ordered list right so I can make another oh L and
86:37 - We'll close this off and I could define different list items so I could just say like item 1
86:42 - Etc. And now we're gonna have a list inside of this list. So
86:48 - inside of the oranges list item
86:50 - We have another list and it'll start listing out things
86:52 - So you can embed these lists all you want and that can be a really useful thing to do. So
86:57 - Ordered lists and unordered lists are the two most popular types of Lists. You'll see in HTML and
87:02 - 90% of the time you're only gonna be working with those but there's actually another list that
87:07 - Exists and I just want to kind of tell you guys about it
87:11 - You're probably not gonna see this one as much because it's not as popular
87:13 - But at least you can sort of learn what it does
87:16 - So it's called a description list and this is a special type of list to where
87:21 - you can list out items and then you can describe those items so you can create a description list with these DL tags and
87:31 - I'm just going to close this one off and then inside of here we can define not a list item
87:36 - We're gonna define a description term
87:39 - So this is gonna be DT and it works just like a list item does so in here I could just type
87:46 - apples and
87:48 - in addition to a description term
87:50 - We can also give the description term a description so we can describe the description term and we're just gonna type DD
87:58 - and
88:00 - we'll end this off and so here I can describe the apples so I could say like -
88:05 - They are red or something. And now when I go over to my website, you'll see that we have this apples
88:12 - item in the list and then we have the description right below it so I could add in another one for like
88:20 - Oranges
88:24 - And we'll have a couple different items with description
88:28 - So this can be kind of useful if you want to, you know have list items that have descriptions
88:33 - So those are the three basic types of Lists
88:35 - Like I said for the most part, you're probably only going to be using ordered lists or unordered lists
88:40 - Or at least those are the most popular that you're gonna see but description list exists and they're really useful as well
88:46 - So you can now start making different lists in HTML
88:53 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about creating tables in HTML a table is basically a way that you can
89:01 - Format information and display it to your users. So if you ever use something like
89:06 - Microsoft Excel or Google sheets, you're basically working with tables and that's kind of what we're doing here in HTML
89:13 - over here
89:13 - I just pulled up some images of a bunch of different tables and these are just examples
89:18 - Of the kind of things that we can create when we create our tables in HTML so you can layout information in this table
89:26 - format
89:28 - So the way we could table is by using the HTML table tag, and this is kind of a complex tag
89:35 - So you want to make sure that you pay attention to all the components that go into a table?
89:40 - so I'm just gonna create this table tag and
89:46 - Then I'm also going to need an ending tag
89:48 - and so inside of here we can put everything that we want to go inside of our
89:52 - Table and the most basic layout for a table is you're defining a table row
89:59 - So a table row is like a horizontal part of a table, right?
90:02 - It's one entry into the table and we can define a table row using these table row tags. So
90:08 - TR and
90:11 - Ending tags for TR
90:13 - So this is gonna represent like one horizontal row one entry
90:18 - into our table and
90:19 - You can define the individual data for the table
90:23 - In other words like the individual data for each column in the table by using something called table of data. So table data is
90:31 - Just gonna go inside of this tag, so I could create one piece of data. I'm just gonna call this one and
90:37 - That would represent one column in my table
90:40 - So this is like one column and then if I put another table data, it would be like another column in the table
90:45 - So I'm gonna copy this and we'll just paste it below here. We'll call this one too. And
90:52 - I'm gonna do the same thing. We'll do one more and we'll call it three
90:58 - So now when I come over to my website
91:01 - What I should have is a basic table with three entries or columns in one row of information
91:08 - And that's exactly what I have. So I just have 1 2 and then 3
91:14 - Right here. What I could do is I could insert another row into my table, right so I have this
91:20 - initial table row right here if I wanted I could just copy this and I can paste it right below and
91:26 - Now what we're doing is we're defining another row. So if I refresh my page, you can see we have these two rows
91:33 - So why don't we change this to 4?
91:37 - 5 & 6
91:39 - And you can see that the rows in the table are formatted just like they are here
91:44 - So this row was specified first, and it's showing up first in the table
91:49 - Then we specified this row and now that's showing up second
91:52 - So that's the basics of adding data into a table, but we can also take this a step further
91:58 - So if I wanted to instead of just defining data, I could define headers for the data
92:04 - So I'm gonna make another table row
92:07 - and
92:09 - Over here. It's gonna stay a table row, but instead of defining table data, I'm gonna define a table header
92:16 - So instead of TD, it's gonna be th and I'm just gonna change that on all of these
92:23 - And so now I'm gonna change these so these are gonna be like the titles or the titles of each column for our table
92:30 - So I could say like num1 num2
92:34 - And
92:35 - number 3 so
92:37 - basically, they have to list out three numbers and you'll see here that these are now like
92:42 - specified in bold, so these would be like
92:44 - You know the different column titles and then here we have the information for each column
92:49 - One of the other things about tables is that they're really flexible
92:52 - so if I wanted to come over here and add in another or column to the table, all I have to do is just
92:59 - Copy this guy we can just put in another table data entry so we could say like three and a half
93:07 - So now in addition to this three, we're also gonna have another entry in the table
93:12 - But we don't have to have entries for like these table headers or for this other guy
93:17 - You can just put whatever entries you want. And the other cool thing about tables is that they'll resize themselves
93:22 - So as I make this window smaller
93:24 - You'll see that the text inside of this table is
93:26 - Like wrapping around and that's kind of cool so you can compress the table and you'll still have all this
93:32 - Information and you can see that the information below it is actually moving down to accommodate it
93:37 - so tables are actually really responsive so you can define as many
93:40 - Table rows and as much table data as you want and there's actually another thing we can do which is add in a caption
93:47 - So the caption will be like the overall title of the table. So right here underneath the table tag, I'm gonna put these
93:54 - Caption tags. And again, this is like the title of the table so we could just say like
93:59 - list of numbers
94:03 - And
94:04 - Now this table will have a nice caption on it. So
94:08 - you can see the caption will sit like right in the middle right above the table and a
94:12 - lot of times what people will do is they'll make this like a header so you can make this a header -
94:18 - and
94:19 - Now it'll be like this nice big title for our table. So it looks really good
94:24 - So that's the basics of using a table
94:26 - another thing that people like to do is define a table head and a table body and this is just makes it easier for
94:34 - People to read through the tables in the HTML
94:37 - So for example right now it's like not super obvious that this is supposed to be the table
94:41 - Heading and it's not super obvious that this is supposed to be like the content of the table so you can separate the two
94:47 - Sections by specifying the table head and a table body. So up here right underneath the actually right before
94:55 - This caption we're gonna define the table head. So I'm just gonna say tee head and
95:01 - Then below here, I'm gonna say I'm just and this
95:06 - and
95:07 - Now I'll just sort of indent this so it looks a little bit better
95:10 - So this is going to be all the information in the header of the table
95:14 - Now we can create another tag called a table body and it's going to be the same thing. I'm just gonna say
95:21 - T body and
95:23 - Then we'll end the T body down here at the bottom of the table
95:27 - And
95:29 - Again, I'm just gonna kind of indent these things
95:33 - so it's easier to see so now our table is laid out with a head and a body and
95:38 - you'll see that it doesn't change the way the table looks but it just allows us to
95:43 - Format it and organize it a little bit better
95:49 - Now there's one more thing that we can do with tables which is control with something called call span and
95:54 - Call span stands for a column span. So
95:58 - For example, I have this one right here. Right? And this is in the table
96:03 - You'll notice that when we look at the table one takes up exactly one column in the table, right?
96:08 - So it's taking up one column and then in the second column, we have two and then three
96:13 - but I can actually
96:14 - have one take up more than one column so I can come over here in the table data and I can say
96:21 - Call span is equal to and inside of these quotation marks
96:25 - I can just put an integer number so I could say for
96:28 - Example two and now this piece of table data is gonna take up two columns in the table. So
96:34 - You'll see right now. It's taking up one when I refresh the page. It's taking up two now
96:39 - So this one entry takes up two columns in the table, and then everything else gets pushed over to the side
96:45 - so I could also say like three and
96:50 - Now this will take up three columns just like that so you can control how many columns each
96:55 - Individual table data is going to take up and that really allows you to control like every aspect of your table
97:01 - So that's the basics of using tables. I mean you want to just make sure that you're using the right tags
97:06 - I mean tables at least for me have always been like
97:09 - Kind of daunting because there's so many of these like little tags in there
97:13 - But as long as you keep them well indented and you keep them organized then you should have no problem
97:21 - In this tutorial
97:22 - I wanna talk about containers in HTML now a container in HTML is basically a
97:29 - Set of tags that wraps other
97:31 - HTML elements so I can define a starting and an ending tag and then inside of those tags
97:37 - I'll just put a bunch of other HTML elements
97:40 - Generally when you're writing HTML, it's good to wrap your HTML tags in what we would call like a wrapper tag
97:48 - and that's basically just like a set of tags that sort of stores all of the HTML and that's because
97:53 - When you start getting into more advanced HTML and you're looking at things like CSS
97:58 - Which is basically just a language that you can use to style your webpages
98:03 - Usually if you want to apply a certain
98:05 - styling to a bunch of different elements you can just apply it to that wrapper element and all of the elements inside of it will
98:11 - Inherit that style I don't want to get too into like CSS and styling, but just know that a lot of times in HTML
98:18 - It's good to wrap up a bunch of elements into a like overall container
98:23 - And in this lesson, I want to talk to you guys about two of those popular containers in HTML, which are divs and spans
98:32 - And those are both sets of HTML tags that you can use as containers
98:36 - You can put a bunch of different HTML elements inside of a div or a span
98:41 - And then you'll you're sort of like wrapping them up before I get into
98:45 - Divs and spans. I want to talk to you guys about the different ways that
98:49 - HTML elements are displayed and
98:52 - this is kind of an important concept for you guys to understand the difference between a div and a span and this is also just
98:59 - An important concept in general when we're talking about HTML
99:02 - So HTML has two basic ways that it displays elements and keep in mind. There's more than two
99:08 - You can get into a bunch of different other ones
99:10 - but the two main ways like the two ways that you need to know if you want to know HTML are
99:16 - Block and inline. So CSS can display what are called block elements and it can display inline
99:23 - elements now block elements are CSS or HTML
99:28 - Elements that take up the entire width of the page
99:30 - so they're just like a block on the page and inline elements are elements that only
99:36 - As much space as they need so you could have inline elements like sitting right next to each other
99:41 - But you couldn't have block elements sitting right next to each other because the block elements take up the entire width of the page
99:48 - Now different HTML tags are gonna display differently
99:52 - so some tags are block tags other tags are inline tags a good example of this is
99:59 - Paragraphs versus links. So if I was to create two links inside of HTML, I can just make a link and
100:08 - It doesn't really have to link to anything. It doesn't really matter and I'll just say link 1 and
100:14 - I'll make another link down here. I'm just gonna copy this one
100:18 - And we'll call this link 2 when I refresh my page
100:23 - You'll see over here that these the links are actually sitting right next to each other
100:28 - So link 1 is sitting right next to link 2, and this is a good example of two inline elements
100:35 - So these links are able to sit next to each other because they're only taking up as much
100:40 - Space on the page as they need right link one only needs this amount of space
100:45 - So it only takes up that much space if I made the text and link one longer
100:50 - Now it's gonna have to take up more space, but you can see we can still stick link to here right next to it
100:56 - These are like I said inline
100:59 - CSS elements so they can sit in line with each other or they can sit on the same line as a good analogy
101:06 - And now I'm gonna create two HTML paragraphs
101:09 - so when HTML paragraph is in a good example of a block element, so I'm just gonna make one paragraph and
101:17 - Then I'm gonna make another paragraph down here
101:22 - And
101:23 - I'm actually gonna separate these
101:25 - So what you'll notice is unlike these links how they sat next to each other
101:29 - These two paragraphs aren't gonna be able to do that
101:32 - so you can see we have paragraph 1 up here and
101:35 - Even though there's enough room up here in this file to put paragraph 2
101:39 - It's not gonna go there right? So it doesn't matter how small I make paragraph 1 like it doesn't matter
101:45 - How much room there is over here for paragraph two to go?
101:49 - It's never going to go over there because these are block elements. So block elements
101:54 - Like I said, they take up the entire width of the page
101:57 - And so they force the next element to go below them these inline elements. Don't do that
102:02 - So with these inline elements, you can just store them right next to each other in the file
102:06 - and that's the difference between the two main display types in HTML block display an
102:12 - inline display as long as you understand that concept the concept of a block element and the concept of an
102:18 - Inline element then you're gonna understand what spans and divs are used for
102:23 - So the big difference between spans and divs is that spans are inline?
102:28 - Containers and divs are block containers so I can create a span and you just do it by making these span tags
102:37 - And we can make an end one and I can just put some text inside of here. So
102:43 - Let's just say span one and then I'll make another span down here
102:48 - Span two and what you'll notice is when I refresh the page
102:52 - These two spans in other words the elements or the text inside of these two spans is displayed right next to each other
102:59 - Right. So this span is an inline container
103:03 - When I make two divs, I'm gonna make div
103:06 - and
103:08 - I'll do the same thing. So
103:11 - We'll just put some text in here. We can just say div 1 and div 2
103:16 - and
103:17 - Now when I refresh the page, you'll notice that these divs are on different lines
103:22 - So unlike those spans which are inline elements. These divs are block elements
103:27 - So the divs can't be on the same line because they're blocks so div 1 is taking up the entire width of the screen
103:35 - But these spans can because they're in line. So that's the big difference between divs and spans is that divs are
103:42 - Inline or no divs are block elements and spans our inline elements and these are both containers
103:48 - So we can use spans and divs as containers, right?
103:51 - So these are gonna hold either text or they're gonna hold like other HTML elements when you start getting into CSS
103:59 - Which is how you style HTML you can actually apply
104:02 - Styling to these spans as well. So that's another reason why you might use a spin divs are containers as well
104:09 - But divs are block elements. So anything you put inside a div is gonna be like a block element on the page
104:15 - So that's the basic use for divs and spans. You're gonna see these used a lot
104:18 - I think probably divs are used a little bit more than spans are just cuz
104:23 - The circumstances for using spans are a little bit more specific than for divs
104:27 - Generally, if you're defining a like overall container in HTML
104:31 - You just want to use a div and a lot of times if you see people using containers in HTML
104:36 - They're gonna wrap stuff in a div. So just remember that a div is a block element
104:41 - So anything that goes inside of a div is gonna take up the whole width of the screen right that div container
104:46 - Itself is going to take up the width because it's a block element
104:54 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using input tags in HTML
104:59 - Now input tags are basically going to allow you to add elements on your page. Where users can input information
105:05 - so these are things like text boxes or text areas or
105:09 - Checkboxes radio buttons, you know all sorts of elements on the site that users can interact with to enter information
105:16 - Now here's the catch when you're defining these elements in HTML. We're not actually making them functional
105:23 - So if I defined like a text box on my website just because I define it in HTML
105:28 - Doesn't mean that it's gonna work in other words just because you have the text box there doesn't mean someone's gonna be able to type
105:34 - In information and you'll be able to do stuff with that in
105:37 - Order to like get information from a user through these text boxes. You need to use a language called JavaScript
105:43 - But that's a little bit beyond the scope of this course. We're just trying to learn HTML
105:48 - So I'm just gonna show you guys the actual HTML
105:52 - elements that you can use to define these things like text boxes and text areas and
105:57 - Then if you want you can go off and learn JavaScript and you can learn how to get input from them. So
106:03 - Down here. I'm gonna define my first input and all the inputs for the most part
106:08 - We're gonna use the same tag
106:10 - so they're going to use this input tag so I can just say input and I need to pass this a
106:16 - HTML attribute
106:16 - So I need to give it some
106:17 - information we can say type and I need to tell it what type of
106:21 - Input I want to accept and there's a long list of different types of inputs that you can accept in HTML
106:26 - But the most basic one is just text
106:28 - So this will basically create a text box for us and you notice that the input is only one tag
106:35 - It's like a single tag. So we're just ending it over here
106:38 - There's not like another tag another ending tag when I refresh my page
106:43 - you'll see that we have this text box up here and I can actually just start typing in whatever I want inside of here and
106:50 - It's gonna be a functional text box. Another thing I can do is create a text box for a password
106:56 - so something that is really common on websites is to have the user enter a password and
107:02 - What you can do is you can actually hide the text that's getting input into the text box
107:07 - So instead of saying type text we can say type password and you'll see what happens when I come up here. I
107:14 - can type normally in this text box, but when I type down here it
107:19 - Covers these things up. So now they're just like little dots and you can't actually see what's being typed inside of there
107:26 - So that's kind of like a HTML way of hiding the input from a text box
107:31 - another thing we can do is define default content inside of these text boxes so I could give this a
107:37 - value attribute and now we can just define a default value so I could say like
107:43 - enter your
107:45 - User name? Maybe this is like a username prompt and now you'll see that this text is automatically included
107:52 - Inside of that text box without me having to do anything
107:55 - now I can also define something called a
107:58 - Text area and a text area is a lot like an input but instead of just having one single line
108:04 - We can have like a huge block where we can add your text. So this isn't technically an input tag
108:09 - It has its own type of tag, so it's just called
108:14 - Text area and in here we can make two tags. So we're also going to need a closing tag and
108:22 - This text area you'll see is gonna be like a big thing that we can put our text in so
108:28 - Unlike these two blocks right here
108:29 - this text area is a little bit bigger and we can actually
108:33 - resize it so I could take this text area and make it a
108:36 - lot bigger on my page just like that and then I can you know type in whatever I wanted into here and
108:42 - That would basically be a place for me to enter in lots of text. You can also define some attributes for a text area
108:49 - so I can give this a specified number of rows or columns so I could say here Rose is equal to
108:56 - And now we can say like maybe we want it to be like ten rows and we could say columns
109:02 - so remember rows are going down columns are going across we can say
109:07 - Columns and
109:08 - While we make this like 30, so it's really obvious. And now this text area is gonna be really big just like that
109:15 - so it's 30 columns across and ten rows down and
109:20 - You know, you can kind of just like see how that works there and you can also define default text for text images. So
109:27 - Inside of these two text area tags, I could just type, you know
109:31 - enter a
109:33 - Paragraph and now that text is going to be in there by default. So that's the text area field and that's pretty fun
109:40 - There's a couple other
109:41 - Input tags that we can look at so there's different types of input that you can accept
109:47 - And I'm just gonna get rid of this value actually
109:51 - In addition to accepting things like text we can also accept something like a date
109:57 - So a lot of times you might have someone like enter their birthday or something and you can see now
110:01 - The browser is displaying like this little date input for us and you get this a little calendar widget and this is gonna look different
110:08 - on different browsers
110:10 - But for the most part if you use this input type you can control like what the user is going to input
110:15 - so in addition to date we could also do like email and
110:20 - Email is actually pretty similar to just the text box
110:23 - We could also do like a range
110:24 - So this could be like a range of numbers and you can see we have this little slider here
110:29 - We could also do a file
110:30 - So a lot of times on websites you want users to upload a file and you'll see that this actually opens up my little file
110:37 - Browser here and I can click open and it will like grab the name of the file and obviously
110:41 - You know you without JavaScript or another programming language. You can't actually upload these files but point is you can give the actual input
110:49 - prompt for these files and you can also define different types of buttons so I can define like
110:54 - a
110:56 - Checkbox and here. We just have a little box that we could check you could also define a radio button
111:02 - Actually, I want to show you guys the difference between checkboxes and radio buttons. So if I have two checkboxes, I
111:09 - Can check both of them at the same time?
111:12 - Okay, just like that if I have two radio buttons though
111:21 - And if I give them an attribute called name so we can name radio button so I could say
111:26 - Button, and we'll give this one that same exact name
111:31 - You can actually only click on one of these radio buttons at a time
111:35 - So if they have the same name, then I can only click one at a time. So checkboxes
111:40 - You can click as many as you want with radio buttons though, as long as they have the same name
111:44 - You can only check one at a time. We can also define different buttons so I could define like a submit button
111:50 - That's kind of a popular button that people have so if you have a form like an HTML form
111:55 - You can define a submit button so I can just say submit and now we'll get this nice little button here for submitting
112:02 - So there's actually a bunch of these different input types and I have this web page open over here. This is a web page on
112:10 - W3schools and it basically just defines all of the input types for HTML
112:15 - so the address is wz schools comm four slash tag s
112:20 - /a t t underscore input underscore type and down here
112:24 - There's this really good list and it just lists out all of the different types of inputs that you can have
112:28 - So you see like button check box color date file text URL all these different
112:34 - You know types of like text boxes or buttons or little elements that you can use to input information
112:40 - In HTML, so I want to talk to you guys about one more HTML element
112:44 - which is called a form and a
112:47 - Form is basically an element that is going to be used to store all of these inputs, generally
112:53 - so generally if you see people using this form element, they're gonna be putting
112:58 - These input tags inside of here. So a form is like a wrapper for a bunch of the user input and you know
113:05 - I was always saying before like when you really want to like accept input from a user
113:10 - you're gonna need an other another language besides HTML and that's usually where forms are gonna come in handy because
113:17 - Forms can like give information to like your web server or whatever, but you don't have to worry about that right now
113:24 - Just know that a form tag is a lot of times acts as a wrapper for these different input
113:30 - So hopefully you guys, you know got something out of that
113:32 - You can kind of got a little bit of an introduction into these different input tags
113:36 - And now you can style your website so users can input information into it
113:44 - In this tutorial I'm going to talk to you about using iframes in
113:48 - HTML an iframe is an HTML element that's actually able to display another website
113:54 - Inside of your web page so you can effectively embed an entirely different website inside of your own web page, which is pretty cool
114:01 - so you can create an iframe tag pretty much anywhere in your site and
114:05 - It's just I frame like that and then we need to pass this one attribute
114:10 - Which is a source and this is going to be like the website that you want to embed
114:13 - So in my case, why don't we just do the draft Academy website?
114:20 - And
114:21 - then I can close off this iframe tag and
114:24 - You're also going to need a closing iframe tag, so you're going to need one over here
114:31 - now inside of these iframe tags
114:33 - You can put some text and this is text that's gonna get displayed if the user that's on your website
114:39 - Can't view iframes. So maybe their browser just like doesn't support iframes
114:43 - Or maybe they you know have some option toggled where it doesn't view iframes
114:48 - Basically, this code would be displayed to them if they can't view it
114:52 - So now when I head over here, I can refresh this page and you'll notice that inside this little window
114:57 - The draft Academy homepage is displaying but it's like super small
115:02 - so if you want you can come down here and we can resize these iframes so I can give this a
115:07 - Width attribute and we'll just make it a thousand and I can also give it a height attribute
115:13 - And we can make this like 800
115:17 - So now this iframe should display a lot bigger, right? So now I can see the whole website
115:22 - and so this website is
115:23 - Literally embedded inside of my website so I can go to all the different pages of the website
115:27 - It works just like a normal website would but it's inside of our website
115:32 - So another thing you can do is you can control the border
115:34 - So if you look here on this iframe, you can see there's like a little
115:37 - Border around here. It's like this little gray bar
115:39 - It's kind of hard to see but if you want to get rid of that
115:42 - There's another attribute we can pass in we can just say
115:46 - Frame border is equal to 0 and now this will get rid of that little border. So the iframe will just be like
115:54 - Even more embedded inside of the website now iframes are really great and you can pretty much use an iframe for any website
116:00 - But one thing that a lot of websites will do a lot of like big web sites is they'll prevent other
116:07 - Websites from using their websites as iframes. So like if I tried to make this
116:13 - iframe for like Amazon, for example Amazon com
116:19 - Then when I refresh the page you'll see that nothing shows up
116:22 - Right i'm not able to use amazon as an iframe
116:25 - and that's because they have some setting toggled where they don't allow their website to be used as an iframe and
116:31 - Kind of for a good reason. I mean one of the problems or one of the dangers of
116:36 - iframes is that
116:37 - Someone else's website could pose as another
116:40 - person's website so I could create a website and just have an iframe of Amazon's website in my website and I could trick people into
116:47 - Going to my website and they would just think it's Amazon, right? So they'd be like, oh, I'm on Amazon. This is cool
116:52 - Meanwhile, they're on my website and I could like take their data or you know do something malicious to them
116:59 - So that's one reason why people wouldn't want to have iframes and it kind of makes sense
117:03 - But in my case like for traffic Adam e-comm, like I have no problem letting people I frame that so it's available to me
117:10 - Yeah, that's the basics of iframes
117:12 - Like I said it, you know
117:13 - You can resize them you can move them around and they can be a really useful feature in your website
117:21 - In this tutorial I want to talk to you about meta tags in HTML
117:26 - So up here in the head of my website, you'll see that I have this meta tag right here
117:31 - And this is normally a meta tag that's included in most
117:34 - HTML and it's specifying the char set of my file right the character set
117:39 - but in addition to this meta tag
117:41 - We can also define other
117:43 - meta tags and meta tags live in the head of the HTML file and the head is basically just used to like to find
117:50 - Information about the file or do some different like configuration with the file and these meta tags are used
117:57 - for metadata
117:58 - So metadata is like data about data so we can use meta tags to define information about this particular webpage
118:06 - I'm going to show you some of those different meta tags and we'll talk about like how they're used and why they're useful so
118:12 - I'm gonna make a new meta tag, and we're gonna call this one
118:17 - Name, so we're gonna give it a name and we're gonna call it
118:20 - Description so this is gonna be the like full-on description of our website and over here. I'm just gonna type
118:27 - content so this is gonna be the content of the meta tag and here you could type like
118:32 - your description and
118:34 - Most websites are going to have a description and this is something that can be used by for example a search engine in
118:41 - Order to kind of like help to figure out what your website's about
118:44 - so if you give a good description of what your website is doing then a search engine could use that information to
118:50 - kind of
118:51 - figure out where your page should sit and like page rankings and stuff like that and the general rule people usually would say like maybe
118:58 - A hundred and sixty characters for a description is like kind of good
119:02 - um, you don't want the description to be too long like if the descriptions over like let's say 200 characters then most search engines are
119:09 - just kind of gonna ignore it or they might even like penalize you for that and like your search ranking, so
119:14 - Description is very important. Just make sure you keep it brief
119:18 - another meta tag that we can use is
119:21 - for the author so I can say meta name and this is gonna be
119:27 - author
119:28 - And actually I don't think I closed this tag. Yeah, so you can just close all of these like this
119:35 - And then again we can just define the content
119:38 - So this is gonna define like the contour who the author is so I can our case it's me
119:43 - And we can also define some keywords. So
119:48 - this is gonna be
119:51 - Keywords and again content so the keywords can just be stored in like a comma separated list so you could say like
119:59 - HTML, you know?
120:01 - tutorial
120:03 - You know
120:06 - Traffic Adam eats stuff like that. So we're just defining this long list of keywords
120:10 - And again, like the search engine could use those keywords to kind of help index your site
120:14 - now one of the things with this keywords tag is
120:18 - like back in the day a lot of people would just like shove a bunch of keywords inside of there and then their pages would
120:24 - Get like ranked on Google or Yahoo!
120:27 - Like artificially so like all these pages would get ranked
120:30 - Meanwhile, they had nothing to do with the keywords that were on the keyword tag
120:33 - So I think probably most search engines at this point
120:36 - Just don't even like bother looking at the keywords tag
120:39 - But it can be good to have in there just in case and another meta tag that we can use
120:44 - And this one's actually really important and this controls how your website is displayed on
120:49 - different devices so we can say name and
120:53 - It's just called a viewport and this has a couple complicated little options here that we can configure
120:59 - So we can just say content and you want to type out
121:03 - basically just this so it's gonna be with we're defining the width and
121:08 - device width and
121:10 - then
121:11 - initial
121:16 - Scale is
121:17 - Equal to 1.0
121:19 - So this is something that you might see in like HTML files if you're looking at them and basically what this does is it controls
121:25 - how your
121:27 - Website is displayed on different devices
121:29 - So if you didn't have this in here and you went to look at your website on like a mobile device
121:34 - Then the website would just display as it would on a desktop
121:37 - So it would display like really zoomed out and really far away and a lot of times people will design their websites to be
121:44 - To look really good on mobile
121:46 - So like if you designed this website to look really good on a mobile device if you didn't include this lineup in here
121:51 - then it's possible that the
121:53 - mobile device wouldn't display the website in that mobile if you would display it like it would on a
121:58 - Desktops like really zoomed out and it just wouldn't look good. So defining like the width as the device width
122:04 - So the current device that's looking at it allows the HTML to kind of like respond to the size of the screen
122:10 - So this is another important meta tag
122:12 - So these are some basic
122:13 - Meta tags that you can use inside your website and there's a couple more you could just do a Google search and kind of find
122:18 - Like all of the possible meta tags
122:20 - But I would say these like four or five meta tags are like the most commonly used and the most important for your website
