00:00 - Hello World, Shawn Grooms here with Free Code
Camp.
00:02 - And in this video I will be giving you three
tips on how to learn Discrete Mathematics.
00:07 - The first tip is to stay calm.
00:09 - People often hear the word Mathematics and
panic.
00:13 - When you panic, you stop listening.
00:15 - If you stop listening, you can't learn the
material.
00:18 - If you simply stay calm, then you'll be able
to learn the material better.
00:23 - You aren't being graded on the subject so
there's no need to panic.
00:27 - The second is to rewind.
00:30 - You can rewind the videos at any time.
00:32 - When I learned Discrete Mathematics I didn't
have this opportunity.
00:36 - In theory you should be able to learn the
material much faster than I was ever able
00:41 - to.
00:42 - I strongly encourage rewinding the video.
00:46 - Finally, explain.
00:47 - Once you think you understand the material
of the videos you can try to explain the material
00:53 - out loud either to yourself or to a friend.
00:56 - If no one is around, or you feel weird talking
to yourself then you can try and explain it
01:00 - to a rubber ducky.
01:02 - There's a concept in Programming called Rubber
Ducky debugging, which is where programmers
01:08 - go through their code, line by line, trying
to identify bugs in their code by explaining
01:14 - it to a rubber ducky.
01:16 - So similarly, if you go through the material
of the videos, subject by subject, you will
01:21 - soon be able to identify any gaps in your
understanding of the material.
