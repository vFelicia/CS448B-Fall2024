00:00 - hi i'm beau carnes with freecodecamp.org
00:02 - in this course i'll be teaching you how
00:04 - to build a hackintosh
00:06 - a hackintosh is a non-mac computer
00:10 - built with pc parts that runs the mac os
00:13 - operating system
00:14 - in this course we'll be building a
00:16 - computer that runs mac os
00:18 - big sur the main benefit of building a
00:20 - hackintosh
00:21 - instead of just buying a mac is that it
00:24 - is way cheaper
00:25 - in this course we'll be creating a
00:28 - computer that matches the mac pro
00:30 - specs but for less than half the price
00:33 - and you can get the price down even
00:35 - cheaper if you don't need the power of
00:36 - the mac pro
00:38 - i've heard about people creating a
00:39 - hackintosh for less than one hundred
00:41 - dollars
00:42 - it's not illegal to create a hackintosh
00:44 - but it does go against apple's
00:46 - end user license agreement so don't
00:48 - think you can just take it to an apple
00:49 - store for repair
00:51 - also in some place it is it is illegal
00:53 - to sell a hackintosh
00:55 - this course has two parts in the first
00:58 - part i will show you step by step
01:00 - how to build the system that we're
01:02 - turning into a hackintosh
01:03 - in the second part i'll show you how to
01:05 - install the mac os
01:07 - big sur operating system using open core
01:10 - if you already have a computer you want
01:11 - to use you may be able to just skip to
01:13 - the second section to learn how to
01:15 - install mac os big sur
01:17 - many computer parts work for
01:18 - hackintosh's but not all of them
01:21 - in the description i have a link to a
01:23 - page that will show you which hardware
01:25 - works for hackintosh's
01:27 - if you want to be safe you can just use
01:28 - the exact parts i used
01:30 - and in the description i have a link to
01:31 - all those parts but feel free to mix and
01:34 - match
01:34 - just make sure to confirm that the parts
01:36 - you use are compatible with the
01:38 - hackintosh
01:39 - when i show you how to install mac os
01:41 - you can follow along
01:42 - no matter what hardware you use however
01:44 - there are some parts where it does make
01:46 - a difference what hardware you have
01:48 - but i'll point that out and show you how
01:50 - to figure out what to use for your
01:52 - specific configuration
01:53 - also one thing to note is that to
01:55 - install mac os like i show
01:57 - in this course you will have to have
01:59 - access to another computer with mac os
02:02 - we'll be using mac os to create the mac
02:04 - os installer
02:05 - that we'll use to create the hackintosh
02:07 - but maybe of a friend or co-worker that
02:09 - will allow you to borrow their map just
02:10 - for a little bit so you can create the
02:12 - installer
02:12 - i'm going to personally use this
02:14 - hackintosh that i create in this course
02:16 - to do a lot of video editing and
02:17 - graphics so i just wanted to make sure
02:19 - it was powerful enough
02:21 - and that's why i tried to make the specs
02:22 - line up with the low end
02:24 - mac pro with a few upgrades i also
02:27 - wanted to make sure that the computer
02:29 - looked pretty cool
02:30 - many years ago i used to build computers
02:32 - and this is the first one i've built for
02:33 - a while
02:34 - and it was just interesting seeing what
02:36 - things stayed the same and what things
02:37 - have been
02:38 - have changed since then okay let's start
02:40 - by looking at the parts that i chose for
02:42 - the hackintosh
02:48 - okay got this case because i like that
02:50 - has this little window here
02:52 - uh it's going to be cool to be able to
02:53 - see everything inside i have some things
02:55 - that are going to create
02:56 - different lights and make it look cool
02:57 - inside and i said one of my my
03:00 - main things i'm thinking about is what
03:01 - it's going to look like and it's going
03:03 - to fit everything i need
03:04 - and then we got this motherboard here
03:07 - it's going to have all the ports that i
03:08 - need
03:09 - it has some good cooling and i got this
03:12 - gpu cooler and it does have some
03:15 - leds on here so to make it look cool
03:18 - inside
03:18 - and this should be more than enough to
03:20 - cool my gpu
03:22 - and speaking of gpu we got this eight
03:24 - core
03:25 - gpu and it's intel and for
03:28 - hackintosh's intel's are often more
03:32 - likely to work you can always check the
03:34 - description where we hit or i have a
03:36 - link
03:36 - of the different parts are going to work
03:39 - but a lot of different parts will work
03:41 - with the hackintosh
03:42 - and then we have our gpu here now the
03:45 - gpu
03:46 - i got because it was similar to what the
03:49 - mac pro had
03:50 - and also because it was this specific
03:54 - gpu this specific graphics card was on a
03:57 - list of graphics cards that are supposed
04:00 - to work with final cut pro
04:02 - and i'm going to be con commonly using
04:04 - this computer to edit videos on final
04:06 - cut pro
04:07 - so that's why i got this specific
04:08 - graphics card and then we have our
04:12 - hard drive here our two terabyte hard
04:15 - drive
04:16 - now this is a little upgraded compared
04:18 - to the default mac pro hard drive
04:20 - but with doing a lot of video i think
04:22 - i'm gonna need a lot more space
04:24 - and then we got our ram here i got 34
04:26 - gigabytes of ram so this is going to be
04:28 - really good for video editing we're
04:29 - going to need at least 34 gigabytes
04:31 - 64 from my research the next step up
04:34 - that sometimes people get 64. but
04:36 - that's going to be a little overkill we
04:38 - probably won't for my purposes i
04:40 - probably won't need that much ram and
04:42 - you may not even need 32 gigabytes you
04:44 - may be able to get by with 16 gigabytes
04:46 - i'm going to be plugging my computer
04:48 - directly into
04:49 - our network our into our internet
04:52 - instead of using wi-fi i'm going to go
04:53 - right through a cable
04:54 - and i did get the magic track pad for
04:57 - two reasons one i love using the
04:59 - trackpad on my laptop
05:00 - and i want to see how easy it is to get
05:02 - official mac parts to connect to our
05:04 - hackintosh
05:05 - and then i got a power supply so this
05:07 - should be more
05:08 - 650 watts should be exactly what we need
05:11 - or even more than what we need for it to
05:13 - run all these things
05:14 - and then i did get a new monitor so i
05:17 - got full hd
05:18 - so it's going to be more similar to the
05:21 - resolution
05:22 - on my macbook pro okay well let's start
05:24 - by taking the motherboard out of the box
05:27 - and this is a refurbished motherboard
05:30 - but it should work just as well
05:32 - don't need any of these things nope got
05:34 - some cool stickers here
05:36 - so just put all this extra stuff off to
05:37 - the side
05:39 - and we got some cables and what i'm
05:41 - going to do
05:42 - is actually well first i'm going to
05:44 - empty this box
05:48 - got a bunch of things and then i'm going
05:50 - to put it just
05:51 - close the box and i'm going to use the
05:54 - top of this box
05:55 - to do the build on this will be like a
05:58 - little platform
06:03 - and you do have to be careful with
06:04 - static electricity so
06:06 - so you want to touch something metal
06:07 - like maybe the case so i'm going to
06:09 - actually just touch the case to kind of
06:11 - get all the static electricity off or
06:13 - maybe you have one of those little ra
06:15 - there's these little things you can put
06:16 - around your wrist that will help with
06:17 - static electricity
06:19 - but i should be fine for just touching
06:20 - something metal or this case it will get
06:22 - the stick electricity off and won't
06:24 - destroy anything on your any parts so
06:27 - i'm just
06:27 - hold this out here
06:38 - [Applause]
06:41 - okay so that's pretty nice looking we
06:44 - got a lot of different
06:45 - slots to put things in so these are all
06:47 - the built-in stuff
06:49 - see we even even have a usb type-c we
06:51 - have hdmi
06:53 - now we're not even going to use this
06:54 - hdmi because we have the other graphics
06:56 - cards
06:56 - but we'll be using a lot of this usb
06:58 - we'll be using the
06:59 - the ethernet cable port and then we have
07:02 - we have the audio built in here so and
07:06 - we won't be using this slot here
07:07 - obviously because we'll be using the usb
07:10 - and so this is going to have everything
07:11 - we need here okay now i'm going to grab
07:14 - the cpu
07:15 - got the cpu here that's the first thing
07:17 - we're going to install into the
07:18 - motherboard
07:18 - so i got some scissors so i can just
07:20 - kind of
07:22 - open this here and we'll take this out
07:24 - of the box
07:32 - okay and the cpu is just this little
07:33 - thing in here right here
07:35 - i think it's focused yep
07:40 - so this is the cpu we're about to
07:41 - install right in the motherboard
07:44 - okay so we have to pop open this thing
07:46 - right here in the motherboard to install
07:48 - the cpu so this
07:50 - there's a little metal thing that can
07:51 - just move out like this
07:54 - and so this pops open like this and this
07:56 - is right where we put the
07:58 - cpu
08:01 - so let me take the cpu out
08:06 - i just have to make sure the cpu is
08:07 - facing the right direction you see this
08:09 - arrow
08:10 - that's going to go toward the outside
08:12 - and there's these little slots on both
08:14 - sides of the cpu
08:15 - you're going to make sure that those
08:16 - slots line up with the slots right
08:19 - in the motherboard so let me place this
08:21 - right into the motherboard
08:26 - and then we can just close this top
08:29 - thing right down like this
08:32 - and this kind of pushes
08:35 - in place and the cpu is installed
08:39 - okay now that i got the processor in i'm
08:41 - just gonna have to pop this off
08:45 - soon we're gonna install our cooler
08:46 - that's gonna connect right to the
08:48 - processor
08:49 - but first let's install our ram okay
08:52 - next up the ram
08:56 - so again this is 32 gigabyte ram and
08:58 - we're going to install in the
09:00 - motherboard so let me get this opened
09:05 - so there's four ram slots but we just
09:07 - have two sticks of ram
09:09 - so we're going to install in the second
09:12 - and fourth slot
09:13 - which is b2 and a2 that's what they
09:16 - recommend
09:17 - when you don't have four sticks of rams
09:19 - so make sure that this is pushed out
09:22 - on where you're gonna put in the ram
09:23 - here so i just push out all of them
09:26 - and i'm gonna put this one in here first
09:28 - i'll do the
09:30 - a2 now if you have four sticks of ram
09:33 - you just fill in every slot
09:35 - so i'm going to push this in
09:39 - until i kind of hear it clicks and then
09:41 - i can push in this side right here
09:43 - to make sure it's in now i'm going to do
09:45 - the next thing of ram push that in
09:54 - okay and that clicked
09:59 - and the ram is installed okay now we're
10:02 - going to start getting the case ready
10:03 - and then we're gonna get
10:04 - put the cooler on the processor and part
10:06 - of the cooler gets attached to the case
10:09 - so let me grab this now to get the parts
10:13 - of the case off so we can start putting
10:14 - things inside so just unscrew this here
10:22 - okay now let's get the back of the case
10:25 - open
10:27 - put this off to the side so one cool
10:30 - thing about this case is there's a lot
10:31 - of stuff for
10:32 - cable management so we're gonna have all
10:34 - the cables back here to kind of hide
10:36 - them out of the way and we'll put that
10:37 - that back of the case in front of it so
10:39 - we'll kind of hide all the cables that
10:41 - are going everywhere
10:42 - and there's little things to put the
10:43 - cables in and if we already have some
10:45 - cables kind of going right through here
10:47 - so let's turn the case back around
10:53 - okay we'll take this extra packaging out
10:55 - right here
10:58 - and this is just an empty well i guess
10:59 - it's not empty
11:02 - let's see what's in it
11:09 - and here just has some extra cables and
11:12 - some stuff that we'll be using laters
11:14 - and then a manual here
11:17 - now we're going to prepare a case to put
11:18 - things in we could
11:20 - take these fans out temporarily while we
11:22 - put the motherboard in
11:23 - but i'll leave them in for now and then
11:25 - see if we need to just to see we'll see
11:26 - if we can fit the motherboard
11:28 - in or not with those fans there i'm
11:29 - going to take this part off here
11:32 - this is where our cooler is going to go
11:36 - there we go
11:42 - yeah somebody they're supposed to be you
11:44 - still be able to use your hands to
11:45 - untighten these but sometimes they're a
11:46 - little too
11:48 - tight i need to use a screwdriver
11:52 - this bag was in the box i pulled out
11:54 - from behind the case
11:56 - just in that slot and i'm going to get
11:57 - some screws that i'm going to use to
11:59 - attach the motherboard to the case
12:04 - so i think these ones are going to be
12:06 - the screws i'm just going to confirm by
12:09 - putting them in before i
12:10 - put the motherboard up
12:14 - and these are way too big these are not
12:16 - the screws okay let's try again
12:18 - i think now i think that these ones are
12:20 - the screws they're a little smaller
12:21 - let's see if these fit in
12:25 - these are the right size so now i'm
12:27 - going to
12:29 - use these to install the motherboard
12:32 - we've got this motherboard
12:34 - that we're going to install first i'm
12:35 - just going to peel this off
12:38 - and then we have to make sure it lines
12:40 - up and we have all the ports
12:43 - on the side and we have to make sure
12:45 - those
12:46 - ports line up correctly in the case
12:50 - so they go through the back of the case
12:55 - it fit in without having to take the
12:56 - fans off so wait to make sure this is
12:58 - lined up here
13:00 - so you can see there's still a gap up
13:02 - top so i'm going to adjust the
13:03 - motherboard
13:04 - so this part lines up with all these
13:07 - ports here
13:08 - okay we should be very gentle
13:12 - but i got the back is now popped out a
13:15 - little bit
13:16 - so now i'll get a screw on the
13:19 - screwdriver
13:21 - and get one of these screwed in okay i'm
13:24 - gonna try something new i
13:25 - it's i'm gonna actually try putting the
13:27 - case
13:28 - down i think this is gonna make it a
13:29 - little simpler to install i probably
13:31 - should have thought of this to begin
13:33 - with
13:34 - okay now i'm gonna get in here and i'm
13:36 - going to try screwing this in again
13:45 - i got the motherboard installed
13:49 - and next up is this hard drive this
13:52 - solid state drive
13:53 - it's a pcie m.2 and this is there's a
13:57 - lot of different types of hard drives
13:58 - that could work with this motherboard
14:00 - and case combo but this the type we're
14:02 - going to be using is a two terabyte so
14:04 - we just open this up
14:06 - you can see it right in here so let's
14:07 - see how to get this thing installed into
14:09 - this motherboard
14:11 - for this type of hard drive there's two
14:13 - places where it can be inserted into
14:15 - this motherboard
14:16 - one's under this panel and one's under
14:18 - this panel so we're going to take off
14:20 - this panel so we can insert the
14:21 - the hard drive or the solid state drive
14:24 - that is
14:26 - so let's unscrew this
14:32 - so first we're going to insert this side
14:34 - into the slot on the motherboard
14:37 - so let's put over here
14:42 - okay now to hold this in right here
14:45 - we're going to have to put this
14:47 - plate on and this plate's going to
14:51 - there's going to be a screw that'll go
14:52 - right in there and hold it on
14:55 - the back of this actually has something
14:56 - that we can remove
14:59 - and it's gonna help the the solid state
15:02 - drive
15:03 - stick into place better so let's do that
15:10 - now
15:14 - okay the solid state drive is secure
15:17 - now the exact order that i'm installing
15:19 - all these parts in
15:20 - is kind of up to the user you don't have
15:22 - to install things in the exact order we
15:24 - could have put the solid state drive in
15:26 - before we put the motherboard in so it's
15:29 - okay if you do things a little out of
15:30 - order but some things just make it
15:32 - easier
15:33 - like it's easier to put the motherboard
15:34 - in before you put the coolant
15:36 - before you put the cooler on because the
15:38 - cooler is going to attach to here and
15:39 - then it's going to attach the processor
15:41 - but right now we're going to install the
15:42 - power supply
15:45 - so i'll get this opened up
15:57 - okay we got the power supply
16:01 - let's get this put in the computer
16:04 - so we got the case turned around and
16:05 - we're going to insert the power supply
16:07 - the thing is
16:09 - the fan should be pointing toward the
16:11 - bottom of the case toward the floor
16:13 - so i'm just going to slide this in right
16:16 - here
16:18 - and then i'm just going to turn this a
16:21 - little bit
16:22 - so i can start screwing this in
16:28 - the power supply actually came with a
16:30 - bag they had some zip ties and some
16:32 - screws so this is what i'll be using to
16:35 - make sure the power supply secure into
16:36 - the case
16:39 - whoops almost lost on there
16:44 - so i just got to get this screwed in
17:00 - okay we're gonna get some of these
17:02 - cables and we're going to snake them
17:03 - through
17:04 - so we can get them plugged into our
17:05 - motherboard i'm pretty sure we're only
17:07 - going to need this cable the power
17:08 - supply has a few different ones because
17:10 - it just depends on what motherboard
17:12 - you're going to use
17:12 - so we're going to try to snake this
17:14 - through here
17:16 - and we're eventually while we're looking
17:18 - at it there are some other cables here
17:23 - these cables are are for our case so we
17:26 - can see our case has
17:28 - some ports at the top of the case and
17:31 - some of these
17:32 - cables here are going to help us get
17:34 - those working we have to get these
17:36 - plugged into our motherboard
17:37 - so let's see if we can get these plugged
17:38 - into our motherboard and our power
17:40 - supply here
17:43 - so it looks like some of these are
17:44 - connected to our fans
17:48 - but right now i'm going to slide these
17:51 - through here
18:02 - and some of these will wait till later
18:03 - to get installed okay let's turn this
18:05 - around
18:10 - okay let's get our power supply put in
18:12 - first
18:13 - so here's the cable for our power supply
18:17 - so let's see how this is going to go in
18:19 - i'm going to have to
18:20 - kind of turn it a little bit
18:24 - it's going to be a little tricky because
18:26 - like a tight
18:27 - curve here to get in and we just need to
18:29 - get it to snap into place
18:32 - okay our power supply is now going to
18:34 - our motherboard
18:36 - okay i made a mistake before i the
18:38 - second cable coming from the power
18:40 - supply does actually go right into the
18:42 - motherboard
18:43 - and it's it's been a little while since
18:45 - i put together a computer so i forgot
18:47 - about
18:47 - some of these steps but now remember
18:49 - we're gonna put this
18:50 - right through here because it's going
18:53 - we're gonna just
18:54 - it's gonna be in the top corner of the
18:56 - motherboard so i'm going to put that
18:57 - here and i'm going to
18:59 - put this cable through this spot to hold
19:03 - it in place and i'll use this little
19:05 - twisty tie here and let's
19:08 - turn this around okay
19:11 - in this top left corner we can see where
19:15 - we're going to
19:16 - plug in the other cable you can kind of
19:18 - see in the top left corner there's a
19:20 - spot to plug that in
19:21 - so that's what we're gonna do okay i'm
19:23 - gonna grab the cable
19:25 - and twist this around i just used two
19:27 - hands to plug in the cable so we got it
19:28 - plugged in at the top
19:30 - corner of the motherboard there all
19:32 - these cables that were connected to the
19:34 - other
19:34 - ports and stuff on the computer we're
19:36 - gonna have to get these installed too
19:39 - these are actually there's probably we
19:40 - can probably make them come up through
19:42 - here
19:42 - because these are all going to connect
19:44 - at the bottom here
19:46 - so i'm actually going to make these come
19:48 - up in a different spot
19:51 - so first let's get this out
19:54 - and this is going to go right into here
20:02 - got it
20:13 - and then here's another one i think this
20:14 - is the
20:16 - the audio got that put in
20:20 - and next basically i'm just looking at
20:23 - the connections on these cables and
20:25 - trying to figure out
20:26 - which parts of the motherboard that
20:27 - these fit in
20:29 - so here's another one this is actually
20:32 - supposed to go over here
20:34 - but we're going to have to put an
20:36 - adapter so let me
20:39 - pop this out here and then i'm going to
20:41 - put up the other
20:42 - spot other area so here
20:46 - now i'm going to get the adapter so
20:49 - here's the adapter
20:50 - it came with the motherboard and so i'm
20:53 - going to put this into one end
20:54 - and there's these different things here
20:56 - let me turn around this way
20:58 - see we have the hd led power sw plead
21:02 - and the manual for the motherboard
21:05 - shows where i'm supposed to put all that
21:07 - stuff in so i'm going to plug the
21:08 - adapter on one end
21:10 - and then i'm going to use this diagram
21:11 - to figure out where to plug in those
21:13 - other parts
21:14 - those other cables in
21:17 - this corner area right here so let me do
21:20 - that now
21:23 - okay let's get the
21:28 - hdd one
21:33 - okay this power one
21:40 - and now i just got all of them plugged
21:42 - in there
21:44 - okay so now i can just run this cable
21:46 - back out the
21:47 - back
21:50 - there we go okay one of these skills
21:54 - gonna fit right here
21:58 - let's see
22:03 - there we go now
22:06 - you can just kind of pull these through
22:08 - here so they kind of get out of the way
22:09 - a little more
22:11 - now to plug in the cables for these fans
22:13 - these fans have cables that are going to
22:15 - come around and plug in near those other
22:17 - cables we have this cable
22:19 - and we have this other fan cable and i'm
22:22 - going to try to get them both plugged in
22:24 - to the motherboard
22:28 - okay i was looking in the manual for my
22:29 - motherboard and i should have done this
22:31 - first
22:31 - it's showing where all the fan cables
22:33 - should be plugged into for the power
22:35 - and i had it wrong so let me readjust
22:38 - some things here and put the fan cables
22:39 - where they're supposed to be
22:41 - okay i got both the fan cables and this
22:43 - cable i'm actually going to run it right
22:45 - through the top here so it's going to
22:46 - come around here
22:47 - and i'm going to run it right through
22:49 - the top
22:50 - and i'm just going to leave it like this
22:52 - because it
22:54 - takes up some of the slack here and this
22:56 - cable will run
22:57 - kind of the way i was originally
22:59 - thinking right through here
23:00 - so with the two fan cables let me turn
23:02 - this around
23:05 - so if we look at the manual here we have
23:06 - chaffin one and chaff and two
23:08 - that's the chassis or or the case so we
23:11 - see the first one is going to be right
23:13 - over here
23:14 - and then the second one is going to be
23:15 - right here so let's do the first one
23:17 - right here it's going to be right below
23:19 - the processor
23:20 - and it's me right there so let's uh so
23:22 - that's the one that the cable that ran
23:24 - through the top
23:25 - we're gonna plug in right there so you
23:27 - can see it says
23:28 - chat one right there and that's where
23:32 - i'm gonna plug in the cable
23:34 - and i am going to need some more slack
23:36 - so i just let out the slack from the
23:37 - back
23:38 - and i'm going to take this cable and
23:40 - just plug it in right where it says
23:42 - cha one
23:46 - so here's a good close-up of that cable
23:50 - plugged in right there now let's get the
23:52 - other cable
23:53 - plugged in now here's other fan cable
23:55 - according to the manual
23:57 - we're gonna plug it in on this top one
24:00 - here
24:02 - so you can see it from this other angle
24:03 - there's an extra pin
24:05 - sticking out because the spot on the
24:07 - motherboard has four pins but there's
24:09 - only
24:10 - three sections on the cable and that's
24:12 - normal so that's what it should look
24:14 - like
24:15 - okay so we got both fans plugged in
24:18 - both of the case fans okay i have two
24:20 - more major things i need to get
24:21 - installed
24:22 - one the graphics card and then
24:26 - the cooler so i'm going to install this
24:28 - first
24:29 - let's get this open this is going to be
24:30 - one of the most complicated things
24:34 - that that's going to be in our computer
24:36 - and you may not even need
24:37 - a cooler like this this is really if
24:39 - you're going to be doing things that
24:40 - take a lot of power
24:42 - and if you want to try to overclock your
24:44 - machine
24:45 - and you just need to make things a lot
24:46 - cooler you may be able to
24:48 - get by with something a lot simpler but
24:51 - this is what
24:52 - we're going to be installing in this
24:53 - machine and i'll show you how i do that
25:05 - so this comes with quite a few things we
25:07 - have this grill that's going to go up
25:08 - front
25:10 - and then this is the part that's going
25:12 - to whoops
25:14 - this is the part that's going to attach
25:15 - to the processor
25:17 - we have two fans and then we're just a
25:20 - bunch of miscellaneous items that we're
25:23 - going to use during the installation
25:25 - so i'll get rid of this box so just as a
25:28 - little behind the scenes here's my box
25:29 - graveyard right here i have a bunch of
25:31 - boxes and just other things that i keep
25:33 - discarding as i'm building this computer
25:36 - we're going to start by getting the fans
25:38 - installed onto this grille
25:43 - depending on where you're going to mount
25:44 - this is which direction the fan is going
25:46 - to go
25:47 - but since i'm mounting on the front of
25:48 - the machine i will face it like this
25:51 - and then we have our second fan
25:55 - okay we're gonna find these screws that
25:57 - we're gonna use to
25:58 - mount these fans
26:02 - and they just hand tighten so let's put
26:04 - this right in here
26:15 - now i'm going to grab this piece that i
26:17 - took off of the case
26:19 - and we're going to mount this to this
26:21 - piece right here
26:27 - got these screws
26:35 - we're going to put that right into the
26:37 - case here
26:51 - we got the grill installed now we just
26:54 - have to connect
26:56 - the end to the processor
26:59 - now this part we could have done earlier
27:01 - it may have been easier
27:03 - um but with there's these two pieces
27:06 - like this that we're gonna put on both
27:08 - sides
27:09 - okay if you look at this see there's a
27:12 - slot
27:13 - at the top of this and this has to go
27:16 - right into the slot there's gonna be a
27:18 - slot right here
27:20 - i'm going to put it and make it line up
27:22 - with the slot
27:23 - i'm going to get a screw and i
27:26 - should have already had the screw ready
27:28 - i'm going to put this down for a second
27:29 - so we got i'm going to open this little
27:31 - bag of screws
27:32 - and i'm going to put this on here
27:36 - and the screws actually have to go in
27:37 - from the bottom
27:39 - there we go i got the first screw in
27:46 - well let's get this one in
27:51 - tighten that up okay now let's do the
27:54 - other side
27:59 - now this is going to
28:02 - line up right here
28:06 - but we're going to do some things before
28:07 - we put it on there
28:09 - see we have this piece and this piece is
28:12 - going to go on the back of the case
28:14 - let me put this this stuff in here for
28:16 - now
28:17 - i'm going to turn the case around
28:25 - and this piece is going to go in like
28:26 - this these are optional you can pull
28:28 - these off if you want i'll pull that off
28:30 - so it sticks better
28:31 - and we're going to line it right up kind
28:34 - of push
28:35 - that stickiness is going to hold it on
28:37 - and then we're going to turn around and
28:38 - put in some
28:40 - some little screw things
28:44 - okay now we have to install these things
28:46 - open this up
28:48 - and we just screw them in
28:52 - and they're gonna go right into the back
28:53 - that we just put on
28:58 - and i'm holding the back with my other
28:59 - hand
29:01 - they screw into it that one
29:12 - okay now we're going to add some of this
29:14 - thermal compound
29:16 - right to the processor and then we're
29:18 - going to put
29:19 - this onto it after
29:22 - removing this little plastic wrap we're
29:24 - going to put this on to it
29:26 - and then there's going to be
29:31 - four of these little things let's get
29:33 - focused
29:35 - we'll put four of these little things on
29:38 - each corner
29:39 - for the thermal compound they recommend
29:40 - just putting a little pea-sized little
29:43 - dollop on it so let's do that
29:50 - and now it's very important to remove
29:52 - this label here
29:55 - or it's not going to work well
29:58 - okay now this is
30:01 - the moment of truth that to push it onto
30:03 - the thermal compound
30:06 - and basically press it in
30:10 - now let me hold it with one hand
30:13 - and i'm going to start putting these
30:16 - tops on
30:20 - okay got those corners in
30:30 - okay we have two cables coming out of
30:32 - this pump right here that we just
30:34 - put on top of the processor one cable is
30:37 - going to be to run the lights there's
30:39 - going to be a light that light up right
30:40 - on here
30:41 - and the other cable is a power cable so
30:44 - the
30:45 - cable for the light that has the bigger
30:46 - end i'm just going to run this through
30:48 - the top
30:48 - because we're going to bring it down
30:50 - somewhere else later let me just get it
30:52 - through there
30:56 - the other cable is going to be for power
30:59 - so
31:00 - you're going to look for something on
31:01 - the motherboard that says pump
31:03 - and if you look right here i'm just
31:04 - about to get a close-up but it's going
31:06 - to be right here
31:07 - let me show you so you can see right in
31:10 - there it says
31:11 - pump so that's where we're going to plug
31:14 - in the power cord for the pump
31:16 - so let's do that right now so we still
31:19 - to adjust this cable so it's out of the
31:20 - way that goes to the fan right here
31:22 - but we're going to put the pump power
31:25 - cable right above that other cable
31:27 - so
31:30 - okay now we're going to use this fan
31:32 - splitter cable that came with the cooler
31:35 - so we're going to plug this right into
31:38 - the motherboard where the fan power
31:40 - supply is
31:42 - so there's our water pump on the
31:43 - processor if we look right here
31:45 - it says you can see where it says cpu
31:48 - fan
31:49 - so that's the slot where we're gonna
31:51 - plug in that cable
31:53 - okay i'll just plug in just like this
31:57 - and then the other parts of the cable
31:59 - i'm just going to run behind
32:01 - the motherboard
32:06 - these front fans that we installed from
32:08 - our cooler
32:09 - we have all these cables coming off of
32:11 - it so now we have everything ready that
32:12 - we can get the power to these cables
32:15 - uh plugged in so first of all let's get
32:18 - these cables i'm gonna
32:19 - run these cables behind this red thing
32:21 - so we can put them out the back of our
32:26 - case
32:28 - okay now i got the cables run through
32:30 - coming out the back of the case we can
32:31 - turn the case around
32:34 - and we have all the our cables coming
32:35 - out the back now coming out the top we
32:37 - have our cable splitter
32:39 - and then we also have the cables from
32:41 - our fans the power cables
32:43 - so we're going to take the power cables
32:45 - from our two fans
32:46 - and just just plug them into these two
32:51 - ends of the cable splitter
32:56 - okay so now we have our fans powered so
32:59 - we have three more cables that aren't
33:00 - plugged into anything
33:02 - and these are the rgb cables and in the
33:04 - box
33:05 - we have this three-way rgb splitter so
33:08 - we are just going to plug each of the
33:10 - rgb cables
33:12 - into each of the ends of this three-way
33:14 - splitter
33:15 - okay one to here and there are two
33:18 - little arrows
33:21 - i don't know if you can see this but the
33:22 - arrows should line up
33:24 - the arrow should line up that's how you
33:25 - know you have it plugged in right
33:27 - so we have this one
33:32 - and then the third one
33:37 - now the case came with these little
33:38 - plastic things
33:40 - that's to help pull these uh these
33:42 - cables together
33:44 - so we can put this right over the top
33:46 - here
33:49 - and that holds these together put one
33:51 - right here
33:56 - here's the third one so i can hold all
33:58 - these three connections together
34:01 - now i'm just going to run there's one
34:03 - this end
34:04 - we're going to plug into our motherboard
34:06 - i'm actually going to put over here
34:08 - because that's going to be closer to
34:09 - where i'm going to plug it in on the
34:11 - motherboard
34:12 - so let's turn the case around on the
34:14 - bottom here
34:15 - you can see it says
34:18 - that white that white connector says rgb
34:22 - on it so that's where we're going to
34:24 - plug in the cable that we just brought
34:26 - through
34:26 - you want to make sure the arrow on the
34:28 - there's an arrow right here that's going
34:30 - to be on the left side
34:32 - that's going to be where the power is
34:34 - and then the other things are for the
34:35 - different colors
34:40 - okay we have one more thing to install
34:42 - and that is
34:43 - the graphics card so
34:46 - let's see how to do that so let's get
34:49 - this out of its package here
34:56 - so that looks pretty nice it has these
34:58 - connections on the end here
35:01 - and so we're going to have to get this
35:04 - into our motherboard
35:06 - and then we're going to have to power it
35:08 - if you can see this there's a place to
35:10 - plug a power cable in right here
35:12 - so if you see on this side you can see
35:14 - that there's two tabs
35:16 - here that means it's going to take two
35:18 - slots
35:20 - from our case so let's look at that
35:23 - so you can see these things here all
35:25 - each of these can be taken out
35:27 - depending on if what you need to put
35:29 - into there whatever card you have
35:31 - and we're gonna need to take out two to
35:33 - figure out what two to take out
35:35 - let me kind of place this card in here
35:38 - we're gonna put into this slot here
35:40 - and it looks like we're gonna take out
35:42 - the second and third slots the top
35:46 - covering will just stay where it's at
35:50 - so i'm going to take off this one and
35:52 - this one
35:53 - and then we're going to put in the card
35:55 - into this slot here
35:56 - so i had to take out this one and this
35:58 - one so i'll start with this one
36:03 - and then before i put the card in i'm
36:04 - going to have to take out this panel
36:06 - right here
36:07 - so i'll take out these screws let me get
36:10 - a screwdriver to help
36:15 - and i'll slide this well i don't even
36:18 - have to take it completely off i can
36:19 - just slide it
36:20 - over so we're going to put the card into
36:24 - this slot right here
36:25 - we have to make sure that this is popped
36:27 - out
36:28 - so it's see it's kind of goes in and out
36:31 - so it's going to start it out and when
36:33 - we put the card in
36:34 - it will go in and we'll snap in now i
36:37 - got the card
36:38 - and i'm going to push it into the slot
36:40 - so this whole thing
36:41 - pops in and then these metal tabs
36:45 - go into the side of the case so that's
36:47 - what i'm going to do right now
36:49 - to make sure it lines up with this slot
36:56 - and then i have to make sure the metal
36:57 - tabs or the metal part is all on the
37:00 - side
37:04 - and just do it very gently and just push
37:06 - down and wiggle
37:08 - and it goes right in and you can see
37:11 - this tab right here
37:12 - popped down when i push the card in okay
37:16 - now i will turn the case a little bit
37:21 - and i'm going to have to make sure the
37:23 - card is screwed in
37:25 - so put some screws right here
37:29 - so these are the screws that that just
37:32 - held on those little
37:33 - black panels but now i'm using the same
37:37 - screw
37:38 - to screw in the card
37:45 - and looks like there's some damage on
37:47 - this metal thing this is a refurbished
37:49 - card
37:50 - there's currently a shortage of graphics
37:53 - cards
37:54 - so it's it's hard to get good deals on
37:57 - new ones
38:01 - and now i can put this panel back
38:05 - and then twist this and there's one on
38:08 - bottom i don't know if you can see it
38:12 - okay now we have to plug in the power
38:15 - cable right here
38:17 - okay we're back at the back of the case
38:19 - and to get the power to the graphics
38:20 - card
38:21 - we're going to take this cable that came
38:23 - with the power supply
38:25 - and then back here in here there's
38:28 - a place on the power supply to plug in
38:32 - this end so we're going to plug in this
38:33 - into the power supply
38:35 - and then we're going to run it through
38:37 - and then we're going to plug this
38:38 - in to the graphics card so i'm just
38:41 - going to reach in here and plug it in
38:43 - i'm not going to show you because it's
38:44 - just too shadowy in there and it's hard
38:46 - to even get
38:47 - my fingers and the camera in there at
38:49 - once but if you're doing this yourself
38:51 - you'll be able to easily see where that
38:52 - plugs in
38:53 - okay i got plugged into the power supply
38:54 - and then i'll just run this
38:57 - right through here
39:02 - okay got the cable coming through here
39:07 - and this has a thing where it's kind of
39:09 - separated so you are going to have to
39:10 - kind of put them together to plug it in
39:17 - [Music]
39:25 - and it snaps right in there and one more
39:27 - thing i didn't put in the spread earlier
39:29 - this is a
39:30 - wi-fi and bluetooth card that
39:32 - specifically works with mac os
39:34 - so we're going to need to use this most
39:36 - motherboards that have built-in wi-fi
39:38 - and bluetooth
39:39 - it won't work with mac os so we need a
39:41 - card that's specifically going to work
39:43 - with mac os
39:44 - now at first i was thinking maybe i
39:46 - don't have to have wi-fi and bluetooth
39:47 - because i'm going to have
39:49 - my internet connected through a cable
39:51 - but the more i thought about it
39:52 - the more i thought yes i want to have
39:54 - bluetooth it also helps make other
39:56 - features on mac os work like
39:58 - airdrop and i think even imessages
40:14 - this card is going to go into this short
40:16 - slot right here
40:18 - so i just have to pull out the
40:19 - appropriate cover here
40:41 - this cable that came with the card is
40:44 - what connects the bluetooth to the
40:46 - motherboard
40:47 - so we have to plug one part into the
40:48 - card and one part into the usb port on
40:51 - the motherboard
40:53 - the cable is going to plug into the
40:55 - corner of the card right here
41:02 - we're going to plug the other side right
41:04 - into that port that says usb
41:06 - at the bottom of it
41:12 - so the bluetooth cable is installed i'll
41:14 - just do a little bit of cable management
41:18 - here
41:20 - now with the back of the case i just
41:21 - have to screw on these antennas
41:30 - this should be all set up and the
41:32 - computer is pretty much
41:34 - done i think i'm gonna need to test it
41:37 - now
41:38 - now i already said i haven't really
41:40 - created my own computer for quite a
41:42 - while
41:42 - and if i made any mistakes you already
41:44 - know because i would have put something
41:45 - on the screen or somehow indicated that
41:48 - i made a mistake and i had to redo
41:50 - something but i don't know yet
41:52 - so i'm gonna test it this is the moment
41:54 - of truth i'm gonna plug everything in
41:55 - and see if it works
41:57 - okay i got my full hd monitor hooked up
42:00 - to the computer
42:01 - i got my usb keyboard hooked up to the
42:03 - cam with the computer
42:04 - and now i'm just about to hook up the
42:06 - power cable
42:08 - and then i'm going to turn it on
42:11 - turn on the power supply
42:15 - now i'm going to press the power button
42:23 - whoa everything's lighting up
42:28 - i think everything is working that means
42:31 - i can finish the cable management and
42:34 - get the case put back together
42:36 - and then eventually we'll have to do the
42:37 - setup you can see on the monitor i don't
42:39 - know if you can see with a glare but
42:40 - it's saying that
42:41 - new cpu installed please enter setup to
42:43 - configure your system
42:48 - now that i know the computer works time
42:51 - to clean up these cables
43:10 - uh
43:15 - [Music]
43:24 - so
43:26 - [Music]
43:39 - okay now that the computer is built
43:40 - we're going to learn how to install the
43:41 - mac os big sur software
43:43 - this is the part where you're going to
43:45 - need a computer with mac os
43:47 - already on it and we're going to start
43:50 - with
43:50 - downloading some of the software we'll
43:52 - need onto that computer
43:54 - there are links in the description to
43:56 - all the software i'm using
43:58 - we'll get open core and proper tree
44:03 - we'll also need mount efi and oc gen
44:06 - x
44:11 - and you'll soon see what it all does now
44:14 - i'll download the big sur
44:15 - operating system right from the app
44:17 - store
44:18 - if you're not familiar with mac os you
44:20 - can get to the app store by clicking the
44:22 - magnifying glass
44:24 - in the top right corner and typing app
44:26 - store
44:27 - once you get into the app store search
44:29 - for big sur
44:31 - click get
44:34 - and then download
44:38 - now you will need a usb drive it's best
44:41 - if it's at least 16 gigabytes
44:44 - i'm going to format the drive now using
44:46 - disk utility
44:48 - to get into the disk utility just click
44:50 - the magnifying glass and type
44:51 - disk utility make sure that the view is
44:54 - set to show
44:55 - all devices click the usb drive
44:58 - then click erase in the top menu
45:02 - you can call the volume anything you
45:03 - like but i recommend
45:05 - my volume if you want to use the exact
45:07 - command
45:08 - i use later in the video make sure the
45:10 - format is mac os
45:12 - extended journaled and that the scheme
45:15 - is guid partition map
45:18 - then click the erase button after the
45:21 - usb drive is prepared
45:23 - open the terminal in mac os you will
45:26 - need to use a command in the terminal
45:27 - to make the usb drive into a bootable
45:30 - installer for mac os
45:32 - there's a specific command i have to use
45:34 - here check the description
45:36 - for the exact text of the command also
45:39 - this command is specific to big sur
45:41 - if you're installing a different version
45:43 - of mac os i'm going to leave a link in
45:45 - the description
45:46 - for the commands for the different
45:48 - versions if you're installing a
45:49 - different version
45:50 - you'll have to wait a bit for this to
45:52 - install
45:54 - after this is done open the oc gen x
45:57 - program
45:57 - you downloaded earlier to open the
46:00 - program you will have to right-click the
46:01 - icon
46:03 - select open then select open again
46:07 - this program is optional to use
46:10 - the software helps us prepare what we
46:12 - need to install macos
46:14 - on our particular hardware setup
46:17 - it will go out and get everything we
46:19 - need except the ssdts
46:21 - and put them in a folder for you you can
46:25 - also do this in a more manual method
46:27 - by following the open core install guide
46:30 - which i've linked down in the
46:31 - description but this program
46:34 - simplifies things for us on this first
46:37 - screen under system type choose coffee
46:40 - lake
46:42 - this is a reference to the specific type
46:44 - of processor
46:45 - i got for this build if you are using a
46:48 - different processor
46:50 - you may have to select something
46:51 - different here
46:53 - look in your processor's documentation
46:55 - to determine the name of the micro
46:57 - architecture it uses
46:59 - getting this right is very important a
47:01 - lot of these tabs we can keep
47:03 - at the default settings under graphics
47:06 - select whatever green and under audio
47:09 - select
47:10 - apple alc under ethernet
47:14 - select intel mousey you can keep
47:17 - firmware drivers
47:18 - at the default setting the sm
47:21 - bios is important and you have to
47:24 - specify the correct
47:25 - system model for this hardware setup
47:27 - we'll select
47:28 - imac 19 comma 1. if you are using a
47:32 - different processor or a different
47:34 - operating system
47:35 - this could be different to figure out
47:38 - what to use
47:38 - here if you have a different setup go to
47:41 - the open core install guide
47:43 - select the section on the left side for
47:45 - your processor type or chipset
47:47 - in my case it is coffee lake then find
47:50 - the heading
47:51 - platform info scroll down a bit
47:54 - and you will see a table with the sm
47:56 - bios to use
47:58 - so for this build with the big sur
48:00 - operating system
48:01 - we're going to select imac 19 comma 1
48:05 - under system model in the oc gen x
48:07 - program
48:08 - finally we'll click the generate efi
48:11 - button
48:12 - at the bottom now you can open up the
48:15 - efi
48:16 - folder that was just created and see
48:18 - exactly what's in it
48:20 - inside there are many files and folders
48:22 - including an acpi folder
48:25 - that is empty this folder will be filled
48:28 - with ssdts
48:30 - but we now have all the other files we
48:32 - need including drivers
48:34 - texts and a config.plist file
48:38 - which we will be updating in a little
48:40 - bit
48:41 - now we'll get the ssdt files
48:45 - this is different depending on your
48:47 - processor or chipset
48:48 - you can find the exact ones you need in
48:50 - the open core install guide under the
48:53 - acpi heading
48:55 - make sure you're in the section for your
48:56 - processor type
48:58 - there are four needed for the coffee
48:59 - lake system click on the first one
49:02 - ssdt plug
49:05 - then we'll go to pre-built ssdt's on the
49:08 - side
49:09 - and click coffee lake and then i'll
49:12 - download
49:13 - all four of these
49:16 - i have a link in the description to the
49:18 - page with these ssdts
49:26 - once they are all downloaded move them
49:29 - into the efi folder
49:31 - specifically into the acpi subfolder
49:34 - in the oc subfolder
49:39 - now we'll use the mount efi program that
49:41 - we downloaded earlier
49:43 - we'll use it to mount the hidden efi
49:46 - partition
49:47 - on the usb drive we'll right click
49:51 - on mount efi.command and click open
49:54 - then open again
50:00 - if you get an error like i did you can
50:02 - open the folder
50:03 - in terminal and then run the program
50:06 - with python 3
50:08 - using the command python 3 space mount
50:10 - efi dot command
50:14 - once the program's running select your
50:16 - usb drive
50:18 - it should have a name like install mac
50:20 - os big sur
50:21 - since we made it into a bootable
50:23 - installer for mac os
50:25 - in my case it's option 2. i'll put in
50:28 - the password for the computer
50:30 - and now the efi partition has been
50:33 - mounted
50:35 - you now have a mounted efi partition and
50:38 - an efi
50:39 - folder from oc gen x drag the efi folder
50:44 - into the efi partition
50:48 - now we'll open proper tree which we
50:50 - downloaded earlier
50:52 - like before you can open it by
50:54 - right-clicking and selecting open
50:57 - or you may have to run it from the
50:58 - terminal with the command
51:00 - python3 propertree.command
51:06 - go to file open
51:10 - select the efi partition then the oc
51:13 - folder
51:16 - then open the config.p list file
51:21 - the first thing we need to do is to
51:23 - inject all of the files
51:24 - in the efi folder into the config.plist
51:27 - file
51:29 - so we have to go to file then select oc
51:32 - snapshot
51:33 - make sure you're on the efi partition go
51:36 - to the efi folder
51:37 - and then the oc folder and click the
51:40 - choose button
51:42 - a dialog box could pop up here about
51:44 - what version to use
51:45 - if this happens click yes now go back to
51:49 - file
51:50 - then select oc clean snapshot
51:53 - and select choose i mentioned that
51:56 - instead of using the oc gen x
51:58 - program you can manually do everything
52:01 - by following the open core
52:02 - install guide at this point we'll verify
52:05 - that everything got set up correctly
52:07 - according to the official install guide
52:10 - so on the guide for coffee lake we'll
52:14 - verify these
52:15 - quirks are set correctly in the
52:17 - config.plist file
52:20 - let's see do you virtualize mmio set to
52:23 - true
52:24 - enable write unprotector set to false
52:28 - protect ufi services we do need this in
52:31 - our system
52:32 - that's set to true rebuild app memory
52:35 - map
52:36 - set to true sync runtime permissions
52:39 - set to true
52:42 - and now we do need to set up our device
52:44 - properties so that our onboard graphics
52:47 - work
52:48 - we just need to add this row of
52:49 - characters
52:53 - i also have the characters in the
52:55 - description so just copy it
52:57 - and put it into the config.p list under
52:59 - device properties
53:01 - click on add then right click and choose
53:05 - new child under add
53:08 - double click where it says new string
53:11 - and just paste the text
53:13 - into the field and hit enter then select
53:17 - in the next column where it says string
53:19 - and make sure that it is set to
53:21 - dictionary
53:25 - next we need to make another child under
53:27 - it as you can see in the picture
53:29 - in the documentation right click on the
53:32 - text you just added
53:34 - and select new child
53:38 - and then then replace new string with
53:41 - this text here from the documentation
53:44 - just copy the characters also in the
53:46 - description
53:47 - double-click and paste then change
53:51 - string
53:52 - in the next column to data and then add
53:55 - this
53:56 - set of characters right here in the
53:57 - third column
53:59 - again if you have a different processor
54:01 - type you're going to want to
54:03 - read this section in the documentation
54:05 - to make sure you are using the correct
54:07 - values
54:09 - now we'll add another new child make
54:12 - sure the child is under the line that
54:14 - starts with
54:15 - pci and not the one that starts with
54:17 - aapl
54:19 - replace new string with frame buffer
54:22 - patch enable
54:26 - create another new child under the line
54:28 - that starts with pci
54:30 - and replace new string with frame buffer
54:33 - stolen mem now these should both be set
54:39 - to data not string
54:43 - and we need to add these numbers from
54:45 - the documentation
54:47 - in the third column
54:52 - now we'll scroll down to the next quirks
54:54 - section
54:56 - and here they are in the config.plist
54:58 - file and we'll just verify that
55:00 - everything here is set up properly
55:02 - it looks like these are all correct
55:04 - because of the oc gen x program
55:06 - except one more quick thing this disable
55:08 - rtc checksum
55:10 - should be set to true this is a quirk
55:13 - with a specific motherboard i used
55:15 - and i forgot to record myself setting it
55:18 - to true
55:19 - and i'm recording this dialogue later so
55:21 - just know that this one should be set to
55:23 - true
55:24 - now we have to make an update to the
55:26 - nvram section
55:28 - so what do we need you can see that many
55:30 - of these boot args
55:32 - are already here but we still need to
55:35 - add a few
55:35 - so debug equals 0x100
55:39 - we'll just click into here make sure
55:42 - there is one space at the end
55:44 - then copy this over
55:48 - and then the final thing is to add this
55:50 - alcid
55:52 - equals one
55:56 - now we'll change the language to english
56:00 - so next to where it says prevlang
56:03 - kbd change data to string
56:06 - and set the value to en-us
56:09 - colon 1 or colon 0 and hit
56:12 - and hit enter if you need a different
56:15 - language just go to this link
56:17 - and you can find out what you should put
56:18 - in instead
56:21 - the config.plist file is now done so
56:24 - we'll go to file
56:25 - then save we're now completely done
56:28 - setting up our bootable drive so just
56:31 - eject the drive
56:32 - and then you can plug it in to your new
56:34 - hackintosh computer that you just built
56:37 - now that we're on the hackintosh i'm not
56:39 - using screen capture anymore
56:40 - i'm just recording the monitor of the
56:42 - hackintosh using a video camera
56:44 - so the quality won't quite be there
56:47 - until we get this installed
56:48 - and then we'll go back to screen
56:49 - recording so the usb
56:52 - stick is installed into the computer and
56:55 - then i'll start up the computer
56:56 - and then i'll need to get into the bios
56:58 - so to do that just hit the delete key
57:01 - and then we'll get onto the bios
57:04 - and here we are okay so if you get into
57:08 - the bios and you see it like this
57:10 - it's called easy mode we want to go to
57:13 - advanced mode
57:14 - which is right here you can hit f7 or
57:16 - just use your mouse
57:18 - okay so we go over here and set
57:19 - everything up as default
57:21 - load optimize defaults okay i'm going to
57:24 - load them up and hitting enter
57:27 - now let's go over to advanced this is
57:29 - where we need to get started
57:31 - so platform miscellaneous configuration
57:34 - everything here is fine by default
57:36 - cpu configuration all of this is good
57:40 - okay system our vt-d is disabled
57:43 - that's what we want but we want above 4g
57:46 - decoding
57:47 - enabled all right memory configuration
57:51 - everything's fine graphics configuration
57:54 - this is if you're going to use your
57:56 - onboard graphics you would change this
57:58 - to
57:58 - cpu graphics but we're not using the
58:01 - onboard graphics
58:03 - all right we'll go out of here
58:09 - okay a lot of these other ones are fine
58:11 - by default
58:17 - okay down here where it says serial port
58:19 - configuration
58:20 - we're actually going to turn it from on
58:22 - to off we want the serial port to be off
58:28 - okay the next thing we need to update in
58:30 - usb configuration
58:32 - make sure xhci handoff is
58:36 - enabled okay now let's go over to boot
58:39 - boot configuration
58:41 - we want to turn fastboot off so we'll
58:43 - disable that
58:44 - and everything else here is fine
58:50 - secure boot we're going to change
58:51 - something we're going to change the os
58:53 - type to windows uefi mode
58:58 - now we're ready to save changes and
59:02 - reset
59:06 - make sure you have the usb drive in the
59:07 - computer still because we're going to
59:09 - boot
59:09 - right back into the usb drive
59:14 - okay when it boots we'll press the f12
59:17 - key
59:18 - because we want to choose the memory
59:19 - stick to boot into
59:22 - now if you get this error message we'll
59:24 - need to go back to the bios
59:28 - so let's go back into the bios and we'll
59:31 - go over here to secure boot which is
59:33 - under boot
59:35 - and we want to go down here to key
59:37 - management
59:39 - hit that and then click on clear secure
59:41 - boot keys
59:43 - say yes now we won't get that message so
59:46 - save
59:46 - changes and reset and then i'll
59:50 - press the f12 key again
59:54 - okay we come up to our bootloader and we
59:57 - want to choose
59:58 - install mac os that's the external usb
60:02 - drive stick
60:04 - so hit enter
60:07 - and now we're going to load the os
60:16 - okay this is what we like to see once we
60:19 - get
60:19 - to this part it's going to be pretty
60:22 - simple the rest of the time
60:27 - so we'll click on disk utility and click
60:29 - continue
60:31 - and then we'll click this drop down
60:33 - arrow on view
60:35 - and show all devices there are my hard
60:38 - drives
60:39 - if you don't show all devices you don't
60:41 - see your hard drive names
60:43 - so you want to see the root of your hard
60:45 - drive
60:46 - i'm going to erase this one
60:51 - and i just click on erase and then you
60:53 - can call it whatever you want
60:56 - i'm going to call it hackintosh
61:02 - and then you want to choose apfs for
61:05 - your format
61:07 - and for the scheme it should be guid
61:09 - partition map
61:12 - and then click erase
61:21 - alright we're done so we'll click out of
61:23 - here and
61:25 - we'll click install mac os
61:28 - continue agree
61:32 - and agree and this is the hard drive i
61:35 - just formatted so i'm going to choose it
61:37 - and click
61:38 - install
61:41 - this will take a few minutes here it
61:43 - goes pretty quick
61:45 - after the installation finishes the
61:48 - computer will reboot
61:50 - and will come right back up to the boot
61:52 - menu
61:53 - and then you'll we'll click mac os
61:56 - installer
61:59 - it's going to take a little time but now
62:02 - it's like turning on a brand new mac
62:05 - computer
62:07 - so you can just go through the installer
62:09 - like you're setting up a new computer
62:11 - choosing the location choosing any
62:14 - settings that you want
62:15 - choosing any accessibility choosing how
62:18 - you want to connect to the
62:19 - internet i'm just going to kind of go
62:22 - through this part pretty quickly
62:24 - because what you want to choose may be
62:26 - specific to you
62:27 - it's up to you if you want to sign in
62:29 - with your apple id
62:30 - but at this point basically you have a
62:34 - mac computer but once it finishes
62:40 - you'll be into your brand new
62:43 - hackintosh computer running the big sur
62:47 - operating system
62:50 - and now we can finally switch back to
62:54 - screen recording
62:55 - instead of videotaping a monitor
63:12 - ah that's a lot nicer now we're on the
63:14 - screen recording everything's nice and
63:16 - crisp
63:18 - there is one more thing we have to do
63:20 - but first let's just bring up the about
63:22 - the mac and you can see
63:26 - we have the 3.6 gigahertz eight core
63:28 - intel core
63:30 - processor we have the 32 gigabytes of
63:33 - ram we have the radeon rx 580 8 gigabyte
63:38 - graphics card everything looks great
63:42 - now we have to copy the efi folder from
63:45 - the hidden efi partition
63:48 - on our usb stick we're going to need the
63:52 - mount efi
63:53 - program to access that partition so i'll
63:55 - just open up safari search for mount efi
63:59 - go to this link here and then download
64:02 - the zip
64:07 - now open up the folder in my downloads
64:11 - right click on mount efi dot command
64:14 - and go to open and then go to open
64:20 - just hit ok we're going to have to mount
64:24 - two efi partitions we're going to have
64:28 - to mount the efi partition
64:30 - from our hackintosh drive that's the
64:34 - drive that's the name of the drive
64:35 - on our hackintosh we're also going to
64:38 - have to mount
64:39 - the efi partition from our usb disk
64:43 - our usb drive is called the install mac
64:45 - os big sur
64:47 - so first i'll select option 2
64:51 - to mount the efi partition from our
64:53 - hackintosh
64:58 - now i'll choose the new option 2 for our
65:02 - usb drive to install mac os big sur
65:04 - drive
65:06 - okay both efi partitions are mounted
65:10 - so we can close this okay i'll
65:14 - open up the efi partition that's on the
65:16 - desktop here
65:18 - and define the other efi partition
65:22 - once i when i have the finder selected
65:24 - i'll go to the go menu at top
65:26 - and then select computer and you can see
65:30 - now we can see
65:31 - both efi partitions not just the one
65:33 - showing up on the desktop
65:35 - so i will click the other efi partition
65:38 - that's been mounted
65:40 - okay so i have a folder for each efi
65:44 - partition that are that's mounted one
65:47 - efi
65:48 - partition has some folders in it
65:51 - and the other efi partition is empty
65:55 - so let me back up a bit and now i'll
65:57 - drag the efi folder from one partition
66:00 - to the other partition so now both efi
66:03 - partitions
66:04 - have the efi folder in it okay
66:08 - now i can just restart the computer and
66:11 - right after the computer turns off
66:12 - but before it reboots right back up i
66:15 - need to remove the usb drive
66:18 - and if i take the usb drive out then the
66:20 - computer should boot right back up into
66:22 - mac os
66:25 - and there you have it the hackintosh is
66:27 - complete
66:28 - i had no trouble setting up the
66:29 - bluetooth or the wi-fi they just worked
66:32 - and i had no problem connecting the
66:33 - apple trackpad i've been using this
66:35 - hackintosh for a few weeks now
66:37 - and i even used it to edit this video
