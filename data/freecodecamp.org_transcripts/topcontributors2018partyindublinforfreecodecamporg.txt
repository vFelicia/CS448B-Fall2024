44:16 - many contributions to the freco camp
44:19 - open source community and to your own
44:22 - city's local developer communities so
44:24 - many of you are
44:26 - so critical
44:27 - in helping people in your communities
44:29 - realize that they can become
44:32 - developers
44:33 - and giving them actionable advice as to
44:35 - how they can do that
44:37 - so
44:38 - i just want to give a big round of
44:40 - applause for everybody here yeah
44:45 - [Applause]
44:49 - all right well uh we're going to be
44:51 - streaming for the next three hours or so
44:53 - uh
44:55 - two hours and 45 minutes
44:58 - we started a little late thanks for your
44:59 - patience everybody who's tuning in
45:01 - um and
45:03 - it should be really exciting we'll talk
45:04 - about a lot of exciting things before we
45:06 - get started i have some very quick
45:08 - announcements
45:09 - uh things that are coming up very soon
45:12 - that i think everybody who's interested
45:13 - in free code camp should know first of
45:15 - all
45:17 - just like last year when free co camp
45:20 - participated in hacktoberfest
45:22 - and hacktoberfest is the month of
45:24 - october it's a big push to get people to
45:27 - contribute to open source
45:29 - last year free code camps guide
45:32 - was the
45:33 - number one most contributed to open
45:36 - source repo
45:38 - as part of hacktoberfest
45:41 - [Applause]
45:44 - and
45:45 - since then the the repo's gotten
45:47 - 700 7 000
45:50 - 7 000 pull requests
45:53 - yeah so
45:54 - i'll be completely candid it was a lot
45:57 - more than we were ready for
45:59 - and we're still closing all the way like
46:01 - we're back to like october 25th
46:04 - we've been working backward but if you
46:06 - made pull requests back in october don't
46:08 - worry we're gonna get to those soon
46:10 - and
46:10 - we are going to get that all the way
46:13 - down we're working very hard to do that
46:15 - and we're going to make it much easier
46:18 - to contribute to free code camp in
46:20 - october 2018 for the hacktoberfest so
46:24 - the way we're doing that is we're taking
46:26 - a lot of the existing repositories we've
46:28 - got learn we've got curriculum we've got
46:31 - the free codecamp slash recoding at the
46:32 - main repository
46:35 - and then we've got the guide we're
46:36 - working to
46:38 - unify
46:39 - these repos into a single repository
46:43 - that will make it easier
46:45 - for everybody to get the local freeco
46:48 - camp running and to put him on the spot
46:51 - i'd like for stuart to come up and say a
46:53 - few quick words about that
46:56 - let's give it up for stuart
46:58 - stewart taylor he's he's from right
47:01 - just uh
47:02 - three hours away from here near belfast
47:11 - oh yeah so um
47:13 - the idea that the current situation of
47:15 - contributing free code camp is uh if you
47:18 - wanted to have the curricular map up and
47:20 - running
47:21 - and uh that's really
47:25 - sorry yeah so the curricular map if you
47:28 - wanted the curriculum and you want to
47:29 - interact with the server um locally you
47:32 - have to have at least two command
47:33 - prompts open
47:35 - so the idea is we're gonna have
47:37 - just one command that will run the
47:39 - curriculum app which is learn.3.com.org
47:42 - we're going to have the api server
47:43 - running as well
47:44 - and
47:45 - you'll be able to once again edit the
47:48 - curriculum
47:49 - and see the changes live in your browser
47:50 - locally so
47:56 - [Applause]
47:59 - so hopefully that'll make it a lot
48:00 - easier for everybody to contribute to
48:03 - and we are looking forward to your pull
48:05 - requests
48:11 - thank you
48:12 - so yes
48:15 - it will be much easier and
48:17 - our efforts will be focused on a single
48:19 - repository this oktoberfest the core
48:21 - freecodecamp repository which should
48:23 - simplify like we'll have a single
48:25 - contributing.md file that has
48:27 - instructions ideally we'll have a single
48:29 - script that bootstraps your local
48:31 - environment so that you've got your
48:33 - database running
48:34 - and you've got your npm install taken
48:37 - care of and
48:38 - so you're not having to click back and
48:40 - forth and input a whole bunch of
48:42 - commands yourself
48:43 - so
48:44 - that way it will just be much easier to
48:46 - to do the first step to contributing to
48:48 - open source which is cloning the repo
48:50 - and getting it running locally
48:52 - so we're very excited about that effort
48:55 - a couple other announcements since you
48:57 - are watching this on the youtube channel
49:00 - according to like the youtube analytics
49:02 - we looked at free code camp
49:04 - is now the fastest growing programming
49:07 - youtube channel
49:12 - yeah and
49:13 - we're getting about 50 000 new
49:16 - subscribers a month so if if you see
49:19 - like a little subscribe button and it's
49:20 - like red and it doesn't it's not it
49:23 - should be gray and it should say
49:24 - subscribed
49:25 - so just click it and it should do that
49:27 - and you can turn on the little bell
49:28 - thing too and that'll notify you when
49:30 - when we publish new videos which is
49:32 - almost every day
49:34 - we've been publishing
49:36 - comprehensive in-depth tutorials on java
49:39 - c plus plus
49:41 - we recently published uh kind of an
49:43 - anthology video by brianna who's here
49:47 - who who flew in uh from berlin today and
49:50 - it it covers
49:52 - basically how computers work how
49:54 - networks work how how the internet works
49:57 - it covers all that in a nice 25 minute
50:00 - very concise video but we also have
50:02 - videos that are you know eight nine
50:04 - hours long that go into depth and show
50:06 - you how to build full
50:08 - projects and bootstrap developer
50:10 - environments for
50:11 - you know everything from c-sharp to java
50:14 - to node.js
50:16 - and
50:16 - ruby on rails and things like that so
50:18 - we're going to continue to publish
50:20 - incredible
50:21 - comprehensive substantial tutorials
50:24 - all of which will be completely free
50:26 - we're not showing any commercials if you
50:29 - create compelling videos about
50:31 - programming and you're interested
50:32 - we would love to help
50:34 - more people see your instagram content
50:37 - your videos so just reach out to us and
50:41 - we can make that happen but for us

58:56 - awesome well thank you everybody for
58:59 - coming out here uh
59:02 - you all have given up your time you get
59:04 - up your energy you know free code camp's
59:06 - a small non-profit we don't have the
59:07 - resources to fly everybody out and put
59:09 - them up in a nice hotel so you all have
59:12 - figured out ways to come out here and
59:14 - stay and that means an incredible amount
59:17 - to me and to the rest of the free
59:19 - cooking community as well so
59:21 - it's wonderful to be
59:23 - here together in dublin
59:26 - and to be able to mingle and to learn
59:29 - more about one another so i think at
59:31 - this point what i'm going to do is i'm
59:33 - going to get some more english tea
59:35 - all right i'm sorry irish tea
59:39 - i dodged the bullet there right that was
59:41 - that's particularly hazardous um
59:44 - so i'm going to get some more irisd and
59:46 - then we can sit down here on this
59:48 - beautiful couch overlooking this
59:50 - beautiful evening
59:51 - um
59:52 - and
59:54 - i'm going to try to talk to as many of
59:56 - you all as possible and just interview
59:58 - you and learn more about you so anybody
60:00 - who wants to be interviewed uh just kind
60:03 - of when you see that an interview is
60:05 - ending come over and jump on the couch
60:07 - i'll talk to you
60:08 - be assertive
60:10 - [Laughter]
60:11 - don't be shy this is this is gonna be so
60:14 - much fun
60:15 - and uh
60:16 - i see tons of people in chat
60:18 - all of it's super supportive thanks
60:20 - everybody for tuning in and uh yeah
60:22 - we'll we'll make a highlight video like
60:24 - we did with the new york city event and
60:26 - then we'll share that with the community
60:28 - too which should be able to so
60:30 - all of you are able to
60:32 - help
60:33 - give people some context into what they
60:35 - can expect striking out on their own
60:37 - uh
60:38 - trying to learn software development and
60:40 - trying to get their first developer job
60:42 - and i think pretty much
60:43 - pretty much everybody here
60:45 - has
60:46 - their career has directly benefited from
60:48 - taking that jump
60:50 - from saying i can learn software
60:52 - development
60:53 - i can do it i can go out i can get a job
60:55 - i can i can freelance uh i can
60:59 - have a career as a software developer
61:01 - and it's just that that faith in
61:02 - yourself
61:03 - and that willingness to reach out to
61:05 - other people in the community and ask
61:07 - for help
61:08 - and
61:08 - then turn around and help other people
61:10 - in the community do the same and that's
61:12 - precisely the spirit we want to capture
61:15 - and convey to the rest of the free
61:17 - cocaine community which at this point is
61:19 - millions of people around the world
61:21 - um
61:22 - many of whom have never
61:24 - coded before and are eager to get
61:27 - started so we can provide a lot of
61:29 - guidance for them
61:30 - so i'll be right over here in just a
61:32 - minute i'm just going to grab some tea
61:34 - i want to
61:35 - have a special thank you

63:21 - your loss i'm also canadian so that's
63:22 - why the story is there
63:24 - um but yeah so we're going to be
63:26 - setting up here momentarily for the
63:28 - interviews uh the camera i'm going to
63:30 - cut it for a quick second because i want
63:31 - to make a minor modification anybody on
63:33 - the stream is probably seeing a bit of a
63:34 - stutter i'm going to fix that i swear
63:36 - i'll do my best um and we're going to
63:39 - make sure that quincy's all teed up
63:41 - because of his flights and
63:44 - if you knew how long it was for him to
63:46 - get here you'd be like oh here's more
63:48 - tea send them tea
63:50 - but yeah we'll be uh we'll be right back
63:52 - and
63:54 - as i did used to say on saturday
63:55 - mornings
63:56 - after these messages we'll be right back
68:29 - hey
68:30 - i'm here with brianna swift
68:32 - let me pop her information up on the
68:34 - screen for you
68:42 - so brianna
68:43 - welcome
68:45 - you flew in uh today from berlin
68:47 - yeah yeah thank you
68:49 - yes thank you
68:51 - we only have one mike
68:52 - so brianna
68:55 - you have been involved with free code
68:56 - camp since basically the beginning maybe
68:59 - you can just give us a high level
69:01 - overview
69:02 - of your involvement with free code camp
69:04 - and and your transition into being a
69:06 - developer
69:07 - yeah so i found free code camp uh while
69:10 - i was an elementary school music teacher
69:12 - i was trying to learn how to code um i
69:15 - love kids i love teaching music but i
69:17 - knew it wasn't a career that i wanted to
69:18 - do forever so i was like what can i
69:21 - learn how to do
69:22 - without having to quit my job and go
69:24 - back to school because i couldn't afford
69:25 - to do that and i thought the people that
69:28 - make the internet are probably the first
69:30 - ones to put all of that information for
69:32 - free on the internet um so i did code
69:34 - academy mostly javascript type stuff and
69:37 - found my way on to free code camp
69:39 - i was really involved on twitter that
69:41 - was my only community because i was
69:43 - really kind of alone while i was
69:45 - learning
69:46 - and went through the free code camp
69:48 - challenges and
69:49 - as soon as i started doing that i
69:51 - started to get involved more in the chat
69:52 - room which there was no forum at that
69:54 - point and started doing some pair
69:56 - programming and streaming that
69:58 - um
69:59 - so free code camp really not only taught
70:01 - me the fundamentals that i needed for
70:04 - you know for development and for
70:06 - software but also gave me a community
70:08 - and a place to
70:10 - you know commiserate almost with how
70:12 - hard it is to learn how to code
70:15 - yeah and so you said you were a teacher
70:17 - can you talk a little bit more about
70:19 - like where you were teaching what you
70:21 - were teaching
70:22 - yeah so i taught elementary school music
70:25 - which was kindergarten through fifth
70:27 - grade
70:27 - um so like you think recorders or like
70:29 - xylophones that kind of thing and it was
70:32 - in central illinois so pretty rural
70:34 - illinois
70:35 - um
70:36 - which i love there's so many things
70:38 - about it i loved um but the thing as i
70:41 - reflect back on it
70:43 - teaching from my perspective in an
70:45 - elementary school music setting was
70:47 - generally going to be the same thing
70:49 - with of course you know some changes
70:50 - over the years but what really drew me
70:52 - to tech is that i can work from home
70:54 - sometimes you can't work from home when
70:56 - you're teaching kindergartners you kind
70:58 - of have to be in the room
71:00 - and um and then it's always changing you
71:02 - know i always am going to be challenged
71:04 - to learn something new in a hurry and i
71:06 - think that's really exciting
71:09 - yeah and so you said early on you were
71:12 - communicating with other developers on
71:14 - twitter and kind of
71:16 - working to build your own community and
71:18 - your own support network there that you
71:20 - could commiserate with and uh how did
71:23 - you discover free code camp because i
71:24 - think it launched
71:26 - right when you found it you're one of
71:27 - the first few people to find it
71:29 - if i remember right i feel like you
71:31 - tweeted at me i think i was tweeting i
71:34 - was like hashtag like women who code
71:36 - women and tech i was just putting
71:38 - anything out there and i could be
71:40 - misremembering but i feel like you
71:41 - tweeted it and you're like hey you
71:42 - should try free code camp and i was like
71:44 - okay and i did and then i stuck with it
71:47 - i got lucky
71:48 - awesome yeah i saw your energy and
71:51 - i don't remember exactly the the tweet i
71:53 - sent but you know at the time i was
71:55 - reaching out to people who i thought
71:57 - would be good um
71:59 - citizens within the community and who
72:01 - seemed really passionate and energetic
72:04 - so yeah so you joined the free code camp
72:07 - community
72:08 - and i remember
72:10 - early on we were doing like these live
72:12 - coding sessions every tuesday
72:14 - and you quickly took
72:15 - kind of charge on those and you would
72:17 - regularly stream yourself coding can you
72:19 - share a little bit about that
72:21 - yeah yeah so i think my first one was
72:23 - with tarakilabyte with nathan
72:25 - um shout out terry kilbyte um and i was
72:28 - super intimidated at first i was like oh
72:30 - everybody's gonna see how dumb i am
72:32 - everybody's gonna see that i don't know
72:33 - what i'm doing i'm gonna you know talk
72:36 - weird which i'm sure i did
72:38 - but it was really addictive not only
72:41 - because
72:42 - it was really motivating so
72:44 - once you're showing up and people are
72:46 - watching you you have to kind of finish
72:47 - what you're doing
72:49 - but also it's so energizing to see that
72:52 - other people
72:53 - can relate
72:55 - and i found out i'll tell people now if
72:56 - you're ever working on something and you
72:58 - can't
72:59 - you're stuck
73:00 - i think the best thing you can do is
73:02 - live stream because and then there's
73:04 - people here like ben and jonathan
73:05 - specifically and nathan tara kilobyte i
73:08 - would be streaming i don't know why
73:09 - people would be watching me
73:11 - because i was a mess i didn't know what
73:12 - i was doing and they would get so
73:14 - frustrated watching me stream that i
73:17 - wasn't doing it right that they would be
73:18 - like just let me can i can i call with
73:20 - you like can i help you do this and i
73:22 - learned so much in those times like the
73:25 - community of developers is so generous
73:27 - with their knowledge everybody wants to
73:28 - help you so instead of feeling
73:30 - intimidated about streaming like oh
73:32 - they're going to think i'm dumb
73:34 - instead it was like they want to help me
73:36 - learn and get better and they really did
73:38 - it was it was really inspiring and
73:39 - helpful
73:41 - and you took a lot of this inspiration
73:44 - and a lot of your early insights as a
73:47 - new developer and you were able to turn
73:49 - around and teach a lot of other people
73:51 - and the main medium we used for that was
73:53 - video you talk about some of your early
73:56 - videos that we put on
73:57 - uh freako camp's youtube channel
74:00 - yeah yeah so those those are fun i think
74:03 - it's a really fun challenge to take
74:04 - something that is thought of as complex
74:07 - and make it sound really simple uh one
74:09 - of my favorite professors dr robinson at
74:11 - umkc when i was studying music said that
74:14 - you should say anything in seven words
74:16 - or less you can't say it in seven words
74:18 - or less
74:19 - you're not
74:20 - saying it well enough and i know my
74:22 - videos are more than seven seven words
74:24 - but applying that concept to things like
74:26 - what is the internet you know like how
74:27 - do
74:28 - how do all these things work
74:30 - i think it's an exciting challenge for
74:32 - me just intellectually but it also makes
74:34 - these really important tech concept
74:36 - concepts so much more approachable and
74:38 - it's like hey you actually can do this
74:40 - these aren't so complex you don't have
74:41 - to go take you know take a four-year
74:43 - degree to understand this it's a pro you
74:46 - can do this it's okay
74:49 - yeah and
74:50 - based on
74:51 - your videos on youtube and the skills
74:54 - that you were able to build up just
74:55 - learning to code on your own and through
74:57 - different communities
74:58 - you were able to eventually get a job
75:03 - can you talk a little bit about your job
75:05 - and how you got it
75:06 - yeah yes i work at github which is not
75:08 - where i thought i would be working when
75:10 - i started learning to code
75:12 - i'm a trainer so most of the time i'm
75:14 - talking to developers about how to use
75:16 - git and github so regardless of what
75:18 - language they're programming in
75:19 - regardless of what type of projects how
75:21 - big their team is everybody should
75:23 - probably be using version control and
75:25 - git is not the simplest thing to wrap
75:27 - your head around so it's a similar
75:28 - challenge to these computer science
75:30 - concepts like how can we make this
75:31 - simple and approachable
75:33 - um
75:34 - this you know that transition was weird
75:37 - because going from elementary school
75:39 - music teacher to working at github is
75:41 - kind of a jump
75:43 - but
75:44 - but i think working with those videos
75:46 - specifically and saying how can we take
75:47 - these difficult concepts and make them
75:49 - approachable to anybody is something
75:51 - that
75:52 - really primed me for working at github
75:54 - so i think even if somebody's going
75:56 - through free code camp and if you're
75:57 - going through free code camp and you're
75:58 - like i don't know if i necessarily see
76:00 - myself as a full-time developer
76:03 - that's okay like there are so many
76:06 - places for you that are perfect for you
76:08 - that you might just not know exist like
76:10 - i didn't know that this job existed but
76:11 - i love it
76:13 - right and as a trainer it's a
76:15 - combination of doing development and
76:17 - also figuring out ways to teach
76:19 - different mechanics of git and github
76:22 - and and coding best practices
76:24 - things like that
76:26 - can you
76:27 - what would a typical day for you be like
76:32 - it could go a couple different ways um
76:34 - usually it's so if we break it into one
76:36 - or one of two either i'm on site you
76:38 - know with a customer so somebody that
76:40 - their company uses github their company
76:42 - says our developers need to know how to
76:44 - use git and github so i show up
76:46 - let's talk about getting github for the
76:48 - next couple days and we go through some
76:49 - projects and get everybody as up to
76:51 - speed as possible
76:52 - but on the other days um
76:54 - it's resting from travel or what i
76:57 - really love is working on projects of
77:00 - scaling that kind of knowledge um so a
77:02 - really exciting project that we're
77:03 - working on now is called github learning
77:05 - lab that's
77:06 - itslab.github.com and it's free
77:08 - tutorials on how to use github but it's
77:11 - a probot app so it's a github app that
77:13 - will walk you through the process on
77:15 - github so you don't have to go through
77:17 - like all the different rabbit holes
77:19 - which i know i experienced when i was
77:20 - learning to code you go on one tutorial
77:22 - it links you to another tutorial and
77:23 - that links to this other thing before
77:25 - you know it you're reading about
77:26 - something completely different right we
77:28 - try to keep it native to github so you
77:29 - can stay focused on what you're actually
77:31 - trying to learn
77:32 - so we're working a lot on developing new
77:34 - courses for that and i think it's really
77:35 - exciting
77:37 - awesome and one big change
77:40 - going from
77:41 - an elementary school teacher in illinois
77:44 - is now you work for github and github is
77:47 - primarily a remote
77:50 - focused organization can you describe
77:52 - what that means
77:54 - yeah yeah so most of our the majority of
77:56 - github's employees work remotely so we
77:58 - don't have to show up to any specific
78:00 - office the professional services team
78:02 - that i'm on is 100 remote i actually
78:04 - work from berlin now from my home which
78:07 - is amazing
78:09 - working from home is awesome but also a
78:12 - challenge you have to be really
78:13 - organized and keep your own schedule you
78:16 - have to know what you want to accomplish
78:17 - in a given day
78:18 - you know make sure that things are
78:20 - prioritized but it also gives you so
78:22 - much freedom i can work pretty much
78:24 - distraction free in the hours that work
78:26 - for me
78:27 - of course i still have to work with my
78:29 - team it's i'm the only one well there's
78:31 - two of us now on the training team in
78:32 - europe and the rest of them are in the
78:34 - united states so there's a lot of things
78:35 - to work around
78:37 - but
78:38 - i think free code camp in many ways
78:39 - prepared me for that because we were
78:40 - working really asynchronously we weren't
78:42 - in the same office
78:44 - i think things are moving that way in
78:46 - general and technology
78:49 - yeah and i'm a huge proponent of
78:51 - remote working and asynchronous
78:53 - especially i think
78:54 - the ability to to sleep in and if you if
78:58 - you don't feel like getting up and and
79:00 - then just working later
79:01 - or uh you know really drilling in and
79:04 - using your best judgment about when to
79:06 - to say this is a priority i need to
79:07 - finish this even if it means working
79:09 - through the weekend just having that
79:10 - agency and being able to make those
79:11 - decisions for yourself
79:13 - i think that's
79:15 - a really powerful thing for a 21st
79:17 - century knowledge worker
79:19 - and it really empowers them to manage
79:21 - themselves
79:22 - much more than in a traditional office
79:24 - setting where
79:25 - you have a manager and they have a
79:27 - manager and i mean github has embraced
79:29 - managers i know initially they didn't
79:31 - even really have that much in the way of
79:33 - managers but
79:35 - what are some things that uh so i guess
79:39 - what are some things that excite you
79:40 - most about github in the direction that
79:42 - the organization is going
79:45 - that's an exciting question cause i
79:46 - think there's so many things that i'm
79:48 - excited about um
79:51 - anyone i talk to whether they work at
79:53 - github or they work with github is
79:55 - developing something awesome there are
79:57 - so many amazing projects being built on
79:59 - github so many amazing minds using
80:02 - github as a tool you know as a product
80:03 - as a platform really about where they
80:06 - can
80:07 - share ideas and collaborate
80:10 - i think
80:11 - even someone that you know works at
80:13 - github what i envision for the tool
80:16 - is probably only a small percentage of
80:18 - what it's actually capable of once it's
80:19 - in the hands of the brilliant developers
80:21 - that are going to be using it um so i i
80:24 - don't even know if i can imagine it you
80:25 - know even in my wildest dreams i don't
80:26 - think i could really see what's going to
80:28 - happen um things like
80:30 - you know detroit water project you know
80:32 - things that people are building with
80:33 - open source taking it beyond our
80:35 - traditional understanding of open source
80:37 - software open source education open
80:39 - source you know
80:40 - social you know social growth and how
80:42 - can we work better as a global community
80:46 - it's it's so exciting i hope i hope to
80:49 - see that leveraged soon
80:52 - what are your near-term goals
80:54 - for both your time at uh
80:57 - your career github and of course just
80:59 - general
81:00 - projects that are of interest to you
81:04 - so learning lab that i mentioned earlier
81:05 - is a big one um i think there's a
81:08 - there's a lot of potential there to just
81:10 - help
81:11 - help people learn how people teach how
81:13 - people understand same as free code camp
81:15 - right open sourcing education making
81:17 - things more accessible
81:18 - to people that i think if somebody wants
81:20 - to learn something they should be able
81:22 - to learn
81:23 - and it's hard it's not that easy and it
81:25 - should be so i think whether it's at
81:28 - github or
81:29 - something greater than that
81:31 - that's all that's where my goals are at
81:34 - awesome well brianna thank you so much
81:36 - for flying in from berlin and uh
81:39 - you recently got married so i hope your
81:41 - husband is
81:43 - thanks to him for
81:44 - letting us borrow you for a weekend
81:47 - and
81:48 - i am excited to see what you do and
81:51 - certainly we would welcome additional
81:53 - videos on getting github and and other
81:55 - concepts
81:56 - as time permits for you to create them
81:58 - because uh i just sent out a video
82:02 - anthology of it's about 25 minutes and
82:04 - it's a we put together
82:07 - uh i think maybe 20 different videos
82:09 - that you've created
82:10 - over the past few years about how
82:13 - computers work how the internet works so
82:15 - everybody be sure to check that out i
82:17 - think that's pretty prominent on the
82:19 - youtube channel
82:23 - and uh be sure to follow brianna on
82:26 - twitter because she she shares a lot of
82:28 - exciting stuff i'm just gonna pop up her
82:29 - twitter information again real quick
82:31 - it's just briannamarie
82:35 - 132.
82:36 - so thank you so much brianna for joining
82:38 - us awesome thank you quincy thanks
82:39 - everybody hi frico camp bye
82:42 - awesome thanks again thank you quincy
82:49 - hey
82:50 - come on over man have a seat
82:52 - yeah good to meet you in person i'm
82:54 - gonna pull up your name and information
82:56 - i've got this great app that matthew
82:58 - potter put together
82:59 - uh
83:01 - yeah so just have to scroll through here
83:04 - these are in alphabetical order by first
83:05 - name
83:06 - yeah um
83:08 - so while i'm doing this
83:10 - why don't you just tell us a little bit
83:11 - about yourself pete sure uh so my name
83:14 - is pete and i'm a data scientist based
83:15 - in london
83:18 - and i uh write for and help edit the
83:21 - medium publication i've been doing that
83:23 - since about october uh last year so
83:25 - almost a year now and it's it's really
83:27 - fun it's really interesting to see what
83:28 - articles we receive and and you know
83:30 - sort of curating them and helping them
83:32 - to you know the high standards we would
83:33 - like to put up
83:36 - yeah and you have written some
83:38 - incredibly exhaustive
83:41 - articles on different aspects of data
83:43 - science and math and
83:45 - machine learning
83:48 - what got you into the field
83:50 - uh so that's a good question so i
83:53 - originally started out as a as a
83:55 - biologist
83:56 - um and i learned a lot of statistics and
83:58 - a lot of uh
83:59 - you know machine learning concepts but
84:02 - it was really interesting to when i
84:04 - began
84:05 - looking into learning the program it was
84:06 - really interesting to see how there's a
84:07 - lot of overlap between some of the
84:08 - skills i'd learnt and some of the skills
84:10 - i wanted to you know
84:12 - start start working with so
84:15 - yeah it's a field of sort of it's it's
84:16 - it's very fast moving it's it's always
84:18 - something new to learn
84:20 - um it's just thing i find really
84:22 - interesting i've always
84:23 - enjoyed statistics
84:26 - yeah so
84:27 - how do you keep on top of all the rapid
84:30 - changes in the field of machine i mean
84:32 - it's probably one of the most dynamic
84:34 - and
84:37 - rapid growing corpus of knowledge how do
84:39 - you stay on top of that
84:41 - um
84:42 - so i think it's constant reading really
84:44 - um i
84:45 - i always look for new articles which
84:46 - come out
84:47 - um a few of my friends work in research
84:50 - as well so i talk to them and hear you
84:51 - know the latest ideas
84:53 - um but mostly it's it's about reading
84:56 - the documentation as well there's a
84:58 - balance between understanding the theory
84:59 - of machine learning and also seeing how
85:01 - it works in practice and i find for
85:03 - example the scikit-learn
85:05 - documentation is really good when it
85:07 - tells you how to use the the you know
85:09 - the techniques but also explains the
85:10 - background of it as well which i find
85:12 - really interesting
85:14 - so scikit-learn i believe is a python
85:16 - library
85:17 - do you do a lot of your data science
85:20 - work in python
85:22 - uh so
85:24 - mostly python yes i also use r um and
85:26 - sql for uh sort of database of data
85:29 - engineering style work
85:31 - uh so yeah i really really like python
85:33 - that's probably my my you know favorite
85:36 - language
85:37 - um i also know a little bit of
85:39 - javascript i started learning that on
85:41 - the free code curriculum
85:42 - um i soon decided that web development i
85:45 - found i found css too tricky that was my
85:47 - problem so
85:48 - yeah i chose to specialize in data
85:50 - science instead
85:53 - well i would encourage you to um look at
85:55 - into data visualization i think you
85:57 - probably
85:58 - i i haven't read every single one of
85:59 - your articles recently
86:01 - but uh i for a long time i was the one
86:04 - who was
86:05 - actually proofreading and editing them
86:06 - before we published and now we've built
86:09 - up this amazing editorial team
86:11 - uh which led by abby and you're one of
86:13 - the major editors there and it's just so
86:16 - amazing having somebody with so much
86:18 - domain expertise who can really go in
86:21 - and
86:22 - take a good look at these articles
86:24 - and kind of fact check them and make
86:26 - sure that they they look good and
86:28 - representative of the state of the field
86:33 - what is your editorial workflow like
86:37 - about how frequently will you check in
86:39 - and find articles that you're interested
86:40 - in editing and publishing
86:42 - i see so we do receive a lot of articles
86:44 - there's always something to work on
86:46 - um i i try and check in daily i actually
86:48 - take my lunch breaks at work as an
86:50 - opportunity to you know see what there
86:52 - is and review some of the articles and
86:54 - if i see one i think i can i can help
86:56 - you know edit and get to you know the
86:58 - standard we want then i'll you know i'll
87:00 - claim that article and in that evening
87:01 - i'll work on it and
87:03 - send it to abi for you know final review
87:04 - and publishing so it's
87:06 - yeah it's good i think
87:08 - the main bulk of the work is is is fact
87:10 - checking just being sure about what what
87:12 - the author's written is is 100
87:14 - aok to put out
87:16 - and a lot of formatting as well it's one
87:18 - of the things uh i learned from from
87:20 - yourself actually from when i used to
87:21 - publish my articles
87:22 - uh for free when you were running the
87:24 - publication uh the writing style keeping
87:26 - things really you know concise and easy
87:29 - to read there's a lot a lot of our uh
87:32 - readers are
87:34 - international they don't necessarily
87:35 - speak english as a first language so
87:36 - it's very important to make sure what we
87:38 - put out is accessible
87:40 - yeah and what are
87:43 - your favorite types of articles your
87:45 - favorite topics
87:46 - to edit
87:48 - uh it's a good question i i really like
87:50 - uh some more general articles like
87:52 - really sort of
87:53 - like overviews of like why topics i
87:55 - think
87:56 - i think there's a balance as well i mean
87:58 - i really like in-depth tutorial articles
87:59 - as well where you can really see you
88:01 - know at the start what you're going to
88:02 - build and follow them along and see you
88:04 - know how something works in practice
88:07 - so
88:08 - yeah i mean i guess it's
88:11 - hard to pick an exact type of article i
88:12 - really like i think yeah we receive a
88:14 - lot of very varied and very interesting
88:16 - articles
88:19 - aside from contributing to free code
88:21 - camp and
88:22 - editing and writing so many great
88:25 - in-depth articles on statistics and data
88:28 - science and machine learning what are
88:29 - your goals for the rest of 2018 and 2019
88:34 - um so the company i'm working up uh
88:36 - we're a startup and we've recently
88:39 - announced and launched some really
88:40 - exciting products we actually teach kids
88:42 - how to code
88:44 - and
88:45 - we produce computer kits and uh we've
88:49 - got some really exciting products coming
88:50 - out so yeah we're looking to ship those
88:52 - and
88:53 - that's that's why i'm working on
88:54 - 2018. awesome and tell me just a little
88:57 - bit more about like do you have like
88:58 - hardware products
89:00 - or yeah yeah so uh we produce the
89:03 - hardware so we have computer kits and a
89:06 - one kit
89:07 - and we also have a software ecosystem as
89:09 - well so people can go in and they can
89:12 - learn to code and they can share their
89:13 - creations on this online community we
89:16 - have
89:17 - uh and it's it's really interesting
89:18 - there's a lot of synergy between you
89:19 - know what i work on for my day job and
89:21 - you know what free cocam is setting out
89:22 - to achieve as well so
89:24 - yeah i really really enjoy
89:27 - spending all my time doing that
89:28 - basically
89:30 - awesome if if people were interested and
89:32 - i'm not sure how whether the product is
89:34 - totally ready for people to go and buy

93:47 - yeah but uh yeah man thanks so much for
93:49 - flying out so
93:51 - tell us a little bit about what you do
93:53 - you do many things within the free code
93:54 - camp community just give us an overview
93:55 - of some of the things you do
93:57 - yeah so i mean
93:59 - you we met a couple of years back
94:02 - you know
94:03 - free call came was still in its early
94:05 - days and stuff
94:07 - so um so what i do currently is
94:10 - basically run meetups um i'm a core
94:13 - admin um
94:15 - for free call cam johannesburg
94:18 - there's a couple of other guys that some
94:20 - came and went and some are still there
94:22 - but some are dormant some are active
94:24 - when needed
94:26 - when needs be
94:27 - um but i'm generally like you know
94:29 - organize stuff and host the the meetups
94:32 - themselves
94:33 - and it's quite funny and it's very
94:34 - interesting like i mean we've got a
94:36 - community of about 1500 people and we
94:39 - get at least one
94:40 - um
94:41 - someone asking to join like on a daily
94:43 - basis it's just insane which is amazing
94:46 - so which means that you know the word is
94:48 - getting out there and people are
94:49 - recognizing what we're doing and they
94:51 - actually see the value in what we're
94:52 - doing which is fantastic
94:54 - um yeah so like i mean
94:56 - the funny thing is this so you you'll
94:58 - put up like a create an event on
95:00 - facebook and our facebook group so it's
95:02 - free called cam john is back on facebook
95:04 - uh go check it out you know uh we're
95:07 - having our next meet up at the end of
95:09 - this month uh 29th of uh august
95:12 - yeah
95:13 - um anyway so like you'll have a couple
95:14 - of people just like rsvp and they all
95:17 - get all hyped up and excited like yeah
95:19 - i'm gonna do this and then next thing
95:21 - you get like five or eight people to
95:22 - turn up um but it's for me personally
95:26 - like it's it's those sessions that i
95:27 - really appreciate and really enjoy
95:28 - because you sort of like see through
95:31 - um you know like the
95:33 - i don't know how to put it but like it's
95:34 - the people that end up coming eventually
95:36 - coming it's people that are truly
95:38 - passionate and really really believe in
95:40 - you know what free code chem is you know
95:42 - offering is and it sort of like reminds
95:45 - me of of myself like pretty much like
95:47 - two three years ago when i started um i
95:49 - was that guy pretty much like i would
95:51 - rock up and i could be like me and a
95:52 - couple of other people
95:54 - um but like for me it was just
95:56 - you know like just getting in a lot of
95:58 - information getting as much information
96:00 - as possible about you know software
96:02 - development um
96:03 - and as far as i mean you would obviously
96:05 - know that you know the learning never
96:07 - stops right so
96:08 - um so like i really appreciate people
96:10 - that that make it to the to the meetups
96:13 - um and i'll grant it i understand some
96:15 - people cannot you know make it you know
96:17 - they'll have other plans or something
96:18 - comes up and so that sort of thing and
96:20 - so i i get all of that but you know i
96:22 - just shout out and say thank you to the
96:24 - people that constantly come to um to our
96:26 - meetups um and then funny enough i'll
96:29 - tell you just besides about that
96:31 - so i was we had a party at um at my
96:34 - company lost a couple of weeks ago
96:36 - and i mentioned to one of the top guys
96:39 - and i said um
96:40 - i'm going to dublin in a couple of weeks
96:42 - i'm like okay cool like so what are you
96:44 - going to do there and then i obviously
96:46 - had to tell the whole story about free
96:47 - code camp and whatnot and they were like
96:49 - mind blown they're like what why didn't
96:52 - i told you guys but he didn't take me
96:54 - seriously so they were all ecstatic and
96:56 - excited about it and i remember one of
96:58 - the top guys there uh jimmy's like um no
97:01 - dude like seriously when you come back
97:03 - like we don't don't you worry about the
97:05 - next venue you can totally use our
97:07 - office we'll even organize coffee for
97:09 - you guys all right yay
97:11 - so i'm definitely gonna take him out
97:12 - jimmy i'm gonna take you up on that
97:13 - offer okay
97:14 - [Laughter]
97:16 - so yeah now with the community is
97:18 - growing um and we see a lot of people
97:20 - coming in
97:21 - um i mean just trip coming here i'm i
97:24 - met a couple of guys um in in oral
97:26 - timber which is our international
97:28 - airport in joburg
97:30 - um the one guy actually he's he was
97:32 - coming to meet his future colleagues he
97:35 - got a job offer um here in dublin
97:38 - as a back-end developer
97:39 - um but
97:41 - so he obviously told him the reason why
97:43 - i was traveling to dublin as well
97:45 - and he was also like like and it's so
97:47 - funny like when i explain the story
97:48 - because i'm so passionate about it but
97:50 - when it finally hits the chord and you
97:51 - see people's eyes they just like dilate
97:54 - for a second then they're like wow that
97:55 - is just amazing like how come i've never
97:57 - heard about this thing so obviously
97:59 - exchange numbers and whatnot and he's
98:00 - like no no i need to get my uh cousin
98:02 - into this thing
98:03 - and that's what i just told you now like
98:05 - i it happens so often i i love telling
98:08 - this story because i truly believe in it
98:10 - i've been in it um i mean it's been like
98:12 - almost three years now right you're one
98:14 - of the earliest cameras
98:16 - yeah and i still feel like looking
98:19 - looking around you and seeing these guys
98:21 - i mean just
98:22 - doing some incredible work and i'm very
98:24 - passionate about it and
98:26 - i just want to see the next free call
98:28 - chem 2.0 or 2.3.0 whatever how far we're
98:31 - going to take this thing right yeah yeah
98:34 - well we're building uh we're building an
98:35 - events platform that'll make it easier
98:37 - for people in johannesburg when they're
98:40 - just using freecodecamp to
98:41 - it'll remind them hey there's an event
98:43 - in uh you know at the nearby office uh
98:47 - where you're having your next event so
98:50 - i i'm optimistic that that will help
98:52 - even more people who are already in
98:54 - johannesburg who
98:56 - uh don't realize
98:58 - that you're having all these in-person
98:59 - events that will help get them involved
99:01 - as well
99:03 - absolutely
99:04 - um yeah i mean it's um
99:07 - so like so it's another aspect of it i
99:10 - mean it's um we were talking about how
99:12 - else uh myself in the evidence we were
99:14 - talking about how else we can contribute
99:16 - like is is this all we can do
99:19 - you know is is that like how do we take
99:21 - it to the next level and i was like
99:23 - my response to that was like that's a
99:25 - very good question brother what do you
99:27 - think
99:28 - and
99:29 - he's over there so he gave me his peace
99:32 - of mind but like for me i think for now
99:34 - is like we need to continue doing what
99:36 - we've been doing
99:38 - because um personally i mean for me the
99:41 - the reason why i believe in this and why
99:43 - i'm still doing what i what i'm doing
99:44 - now
99:45 - is that i see value in this you know i
99:48 - truly believe like this is
99:51 - um
99:52 - one way that we can
99:54 - and i know it sounds very
99:56 - like up in the sky but i really believe
99:58 - like this is one way of actually
100:00 - tackling poverty
100:02 - um and i see people that are frustrated
100:04 - in their jobs uh people that
100:06 - they just you know they just
100:08 - go to work just for the heck of it but
100:10 - they don't enjoy it you know and for me
100:12 - i strongly believe in that like you have
100:13 - to really enjoy what you do and i
100:15 - absolutely love what i'm doing right now
100:17 - and thanks to free code camp and i think
100:20 - the way just back to my original point
100:22 - was that um how to take it forward is
100:24 - first of all we need to keep doing what
100:26 - we're doing you know don't drop the
100:27 - standard and obviously think of other
100:30 - ways um of how we can improve it um
100:32 - whether it's
100:33 - um i don't know like which just maybe
100:35 - writing articles if you would say you
100:37 - were doing like youtube stuff or you
100:38 - hosting meetups um maybe just you know
100:41 - think of other ways of um contributing
100:44 - more or at least getting other people to
100:46 - feel the same passion that you have so
100:48 - that they can also continue and and
100:51 - contribute to the platform in in
100:52 - different ways
100:55 - yeah and
100:56 - if
100:57 - for those of you who are watching who
100:58 - are interested in some ways you can
101:00 - contribute aside from leading local
101:02 - study groups which i think is probably
101:03 - the most important and immediate thing
101:05 - because that way you're able to actively
101:07 - get people in your community reach out
101:09 - to your neighbors and your friends and
101:10 - get them into coding this is a skill
101:13 - that i i encourage everybody to pick up
101:15 - even if you don't envision yourself
101:16 - working as a software engineer at some
101:19 - point in the future these skills are
101:20 - going to be incredibly helpful
101:22 - regardless where your career is so so by
101:24 - running local study groups like you're
101:26 - doing in johannesburg you can really
101:28 - bring a lot of people in just get them
101:30 - some basic exposure and so they even
101:32 - realize that this is a skill they can
101:34 - learn and build up their confidence
101:36 - so
101:38 - i would say
101:39 - some some ways that your community can
101:42 - absolutely help would be
101:45 - uh adding captions and subtitles i know
101:48 - most people uh in south africa speak
101:51 - english but you also have afrikaans and
101:53 - there are other other local languages
101:54 - that some people in your your study
101:56 - group may know that would that would
101:58 - help and uh
102:01 - of course creating more articles and
102:02 - creating
102:03 - creating videos those would all be
102:05 - tremendously helpful no absolutely um
102:07 - and finally mentioned that that not so
102:09 - long ago in fact i think in preparation
102:12 - of the next meetup um a lady commented
102:16 - on a facebook group and the question was
102:19 - um are your meetups uh suitable for
102:22 - um
102:23 - kids
102:24 - and like that caught me off of god
102:26 - because i like you know it's not
102:27 - something that you know someone asked
102:29 - just like that and it was like
102:30 - and i didn't respond immediately i just
102:32 - thought about it for a second i think i
102:34 - probably slept on it i don't remember
102:36 - exactly but my response to her was very
102:38 - simple i said look um if a person who
102:41 - wants to you know come to our meetups as
102:44 - long as they can read and write um
102:47 - you know i think they're good to go and
102:49 - i strongly believe in that i mean you
102:50 - can correct me from if i'm wrong but
102:52 - like i think
102:53 - um there's no age limit when when it
102:55 - comes to learning and
102:57 - specifically software development as
102:58 - long as you know you can
103:01 - look at code and you can read and you
103:03 - can write i strongly believe that you
103:05 - can actually
103:06 - manage to learn and and
103:08 - you know and code so my advice was
103:11 - basically like look um you know maybe
103:13 - just come because she hasn't been to to
103:14 - the meetup i said look just come to our
103:16 - next meetup check it out and if you
103:18 - think it's suitable for your son
103:19 - or daughter you know then you can invite
103:21 - them the
103:22 - for the next meet up and she's like no
103:24 - well that's that's a good answer so
103:27 - hopefully we'll see her at the end of
103:28 - this month um and hopefully we'll see
103:30 - some kids coming up in the
103:32 - uh in you know in the next meetups um
103:35 - but yeah it's um
103:37 - it's just been incredible i mean the
103:38 - last the last year we we've i think
103:41 - we've done more meetups than we have
103:44 - there was a period where we didn't have
103:45 - as many meetups um but then uh i always
103:48 - take cue from from the community from
103:51 - the the the members of the group
103:53 - um so whenever someone says hey when is
103:56 - the next meet up you know quickly
103:57 - jumping like are you interested should
103:58 - we do it and then we just put it
104:00 - together and and that's how we roll
104:02 - um
104:04 - yeah and i i just i'm looking forward to
104:06 - obviously like
104:07 - continuing having like a more
104:09 - uh regular uh credence uh cadence
104:13 - um
104:14 - and yeah because and also another
104:16 - request that came in in one of our last
104:18 - uh meetups was
104:20 - one of the members said they would like
104:22 - to have more technical uh meetup so i
104:24 - think with um with the offer that i got
104:27 - from my community to to have
104:29 - the next meetup in in the offices that
104:31 - will give us the the space and the
104:32 - environment for you know for something
104:34 - like that to happen so i'm looking
104:36 - forward to that
104:37 - yeah
104:38 - awesome well congratulations on getting
104:40 - your company on board is like a venue
104:42 - sponsor
104:43 - and yeah i totally agree i think if kids
104:45 - are mature enough to come pre-co camp as
104:48 - a community is really aimed at adults
104:50 - primarily there are other great
104:52 - initiatives like code.org khan academy
104:56 - and especially coder dojo i love what
104:58 - coder dojo is doing
104:59 - and hack club is another good one that's
105:01 - focused at the high school level
105:03 - but
105:03 - but
105:04 - we aim to make these events
105:08 - totally
105:09 - uh
105:10 - acceptable for kids
105:12 - and we want to keep them you know
105:14 - professional and friendly and welcoming
105:16 - so yeah absolutely if if somebody has a
105:18 - kid and that they're confident their
105:20 - cake will have a good time and get a lot
105:22 - out of it i would encourage them to
105:23 - bring it
105:24 - richie it's been such a pleasure man
105:26 - thank you so much for flying out here
105:29 - congratulations on all your recent
105:31 - achievements your job
105:33 - and how you're leading the community
105:35 - it's amazing and i think you're really
105:37 - setting an example for so many people
105:39 - around the world who want to create
105:40 - local study groups and and help people
105:42 - in their communities learn to code
105:44 - it's it's only a pleasure quincy like
105:46 - i've i mean we i'm just was thinking the
105:48 - other day like we we made like just a
105:51 - couple of years ago and it's
105:53 - you know our relationship has grown and
105:54 - the community has grown and i've i love
105:56 - everything that um uh yourself and the
105:59 - team have been doing and yeah i'm
106:02 - looking forward to the future and to
106:03 - frequent camp
106:06 - thanks again thank you so much brother
106:07 - yeah likewise bring it in
106:14 - hey hey quincy
106:15 - hey pleasure
106:17 - absolutely
106:18 - well david you are a prolific uh writer
106:22 - among other things
106:23 - and
106:24 - i think you have a very interesting
106:26 - background
106:27 - can you tell the
106:28 - audience a little bit about yourself and
106:30 - how you got into coding and writing
106:32 - about code
106:33 - okay
106:34 - first of all quincy i'm really grateful
106:36 - to you that you created free code chem
106:38 - because i think it was really the major
106:40 - helper for me to switch my careers
106:42 - because as you mentioned i was working
106:44 - as a lawyer i have a law degree and then
106:46 - i was working as a lawyer for two years
106:48 - but then i got eventually a little bit
106:50 - frustrated and i was wondering what to
106:52 - do next so i was checking online courses
106:54 - and stuff and funny thing first i
106:56 - checked some harvard course about
106:58 - cooking about molecular gastronomy and i
107:00 - spent like three months doing that but i
107:02 - said to me okay i cannot be cooked
107:04 - because i'm sweating and in the kitchen
107:06 - there's a lot of hot in here so i
107:07 - couldn't cook so i tried to we're
107:09 - watching for something else and then
107:12 - i find and first some course on udemy
107:14 - about uh programming css html and
107:17 - javascript and i tried that
107:19 - but then it was just a tutorial you know
107:20 - building things that other people built
107:22 - so it was kind of it was great i got
107:24 - motivated but it was just the first
107:26 - level and then i discovered free code
107:28 - camp and those algorithms and it was
107:31 - basically a different dimension for me
107:32 - because before i was just creating stuff
107:35 - according to tutorials but with the with
107:38 - the algorithms i need to really
107:40 - understand and at first i got really
107:42 - frustrated because i think oh my god
107:45 - it's so difficult i cannot be developer
107:47 - but then it really just
107:49 - it was better and better and finally i
107:50 - got really confident
107:52 - and really
107:54 - i started learning to code during the
107:56 - weekends and on the evenings
107:58 - and it eventually took me seven months
108:01 - to switch from a lawyer to
108:03 - or just coding into on the weekends and
108:05 - the night so i'm really grateful for
108:06 - free coach cam because it really
108:07 - motivated me to see all the people doing
108:10 - the same thing
108:11 - that's all though so why i decide for
108:14 - contributing for recode camp by writing
108:16 - articles because
108:17 - you know a free code camp community
108:19 - helped me to become developer and i also
108:21 - wanted to contribute to it by
108:23 - by showing people concepts that were
108:25 - difficult for me so i try to like
108:27 - describe them in a way that are more
108:29 - understandable for me and in a way that
108:31 - i want them to be to see them when i
108:34 - learned them because there were no
108:35 - resources before
108:36 - yeah and that's i think the part of my
108:39 - story and maybe just
108:41 - the
108:42 - the main thing what i
108:44 - decided to change switch the careers was
108:46 - that as a lawyer i didn't see the
108:47 - results of my work
108:49 - and as a as a programmer i mean you
108:51 - write console.log and you see the result
108:53 - it's it's so motivating you just write
108:56 - code and you see the result i love this
108:58 - and this is why i love programming
109:01 - yeah with programming there's a very
109:02 - tight feedback loop
109:04 - you can at any point you can see what
109:05 - the effect is you can push an
109:07 - application live and look at your
109:09 - analytics and see people are using it
109:10 - how people are using it it's
109:13 - it's unlike any other field
109:15 - really i mean you could argue that in
109:17 - teaching you can see you know the
109:19 - students faces and and whether they're
109:21 - comprehending things and see them turn
109:23 - around and apply but there are very few
109:24 - fields where you can immediately get so
109:27 - much
109:28 - feedback on your work
109:30 - i just want to underscore the magnitude
109:33 - of your accomplishment david because you
109:35 - said in seven months
109:37 - just studying nights and weekends while
109:39 - working as a lawyer
109:41 - time
109:42 - you were able to transition into tech
109:45 - and tell us a little bit about what
109:47 - you're doing now
109:48 - okay now i work as a javascript
109:50 - developer
109:51 - for the for the uh digital agency in
109:54 - prague or blueberry and i'm doing
109:57 - typical performance stuff i'm working
109:58 - with react most of the time and now i
110:00 - will basically maybe start with a view
110:02 - as well so i'm really looking forward to
110:04 - it because i never do it and i'm also
110:06 - pretty excited about reason ml yeah and
110:08 - i'm pretty excited that uh in my company
110:10 - we have internal projects where you can
110:12 - try different technologies and we were
110:14 - also able to do it in a company and
110:16 - build our recent application called
110:19 - uh called planning poker about scrum
110:21 - where you do planning poker and about
110:23 - application for that so it was really
110:25 - interesting and um and another thing i
110:27 - love about programming is that
110:29 - is the the way how it progresses i mean
110:32 - when i started programming there was
110:33 - jquery and angular okay that's
110:37 - some react i know what it is and
110:39 - basically it was so fast and now
110:42 - i like how it's moving forward there i
110:44 - mean my to-do list it's so long and i
110:46 - never be able to like to try all the
110:47 - technologies but i love all the people
110:50 - who love what they do and you can learn
110:52 - from them so i maybe i just
110:55 - uh and you ask what i do yeah also right
110:58 - as i mentioned blog posts uh for medium
111:00 - publications and it will help me it
111:03 - helped me it helps me and the audience
111:05 - is because for me when i code something
111:07 - you know where you code something you
111:08 - basically don't care about anything you
111:10 - just said okay it works so that's a good
111:12 - but when you write a blog post about it
111:14 - you need to like really understand you
111:16 - will need to go deeper
111:18 - and eventually after that i even start
111:20 - going to conferences and speak about
111:22 - programming and it really
111:24 - helps me even more because at a
111:26 - conference you have
111:27 - qa right q a people might ask you and
111:30 - this like most stressful thing for the
111:32 - first time because you need to go really
111:33 - deep because people might ask you
111:34 - different questions
111:36 - so i know what i really love about all
111:38 - these stuff record camera conferences
111:40 - that you that i learned something like i
111:42 - share with us and the thing that i just
111:44 - learned it it makes i think more
111:46 - approachable for other people because
111:48 - i'm on this level uh they were there on
111:51 - the level i were before so i'm not that
111:53 - like not that on a high level so i like
111:55 - can understand what they need to how
111:57 - they need to learn so that's why i'm
111:58 - doing it
112:01 - yeah that's great so
112:02 - essentially what you're doing by writing
112:04 - these articles and giving talks at
112:06 - conferences
112:08 - is you're almost over training to make
112:10 - sure you really have mastered something
112:12 - so well that you can explain it and it's
112:14 - interesting because we were just talking
112:16 - with brianna a minute ago and she said
112:19 - you don't really understand something
112:20 - until you can explain it in like seven
112:22 - words
112:24 - and it's absolutely true because so much
112:26 - often when i write article there are i
112:29 - just got stuck and i was thinking
112:32 - why why is it working i mean why why and
112:34 - really forces you because you need to
112:36 - understand to to some person who doesn't
112:39 - know so so many stuff like you do
112:41 - because you are into the topic you truly
112:43 - and write it in the understandable way
112:45 - that's why i think it's like challenging
112:47 - for you to learning new technology
112:49 - because sometimes there are not enough
112:50 - resources and these resources are often
112:52 - right by people who are
112:54 - really good at it
112:55 - but sometimes for you as a beginner it's
112:57 - more challenging so that's why i'm
112:59 - trying to write it for like
113:02 - most approachable as i can that's why
113:04 - i'm kind of perfectionist so like when i
113:06 - write article okay i write it it's not
113:08 - complicated but i spend so much time
113:09 - just to reading it we're reading it
113:11 - sending to my colleagues for
113:13 - proofreading
113:14 - it's like really the right wording
113:16 - article is not the most difficult part
113:18 - the difficult part is just to make it
113:20 - approachable for people coming from
113:22 - different levels of their knowledge
113:25 - well thank you so much david for all
113:27 - your amazing articles that you've
113:29 - contributed
113:30 - and
113:31 - i've enjoyed reading so much so many of
113:34 - them and of course i'm very inspired by
113:37 - your just rapid transition from working
113:39 - as a lawyer
113:40 - uh to working as a as a developer and
113:42 - working with all these cutting edge
113:44 - uh tools you know reason ml very
113:46 - exciting stuff working you said you're
113:48 - getting ready to learn some view so we
113:51 - hope that you'll continue to write these
113:52 - amazing articles yeah i'm looking
113:54 - forward i i was also playing with idea
113:56 - to make some screencasts and i was
113:58 - discussing with with other people here
114:00 - and i think it will be really useful and
114:02 - again
114:04 - again quincy thank you very much for the
114:05 - free codec because it makes really
114:07 - difference for people like on the whole
114:08 - planet i think
114:11 - well thank you so much that means so
114:12 - much to me and i hope you have a
114:14 - wonderful time in dublin are you gonna
114:16 - are you gonna come run with us tomorrow
114:18 - i hope so i i have my running shoes
114:21 - running a running t-shirt and my
114:24 - half of my luggage is just a running
114:25 - stuff so i guess i should because i just
114:27 - brought so much stuff with me
114:30 - well great hopefully it'll be nice and
114:31 - cool here uh the weather is very dynamic
114:35 - in dublin
114:36 - tomorrow it should be nicer i just
114:38 - checked the weather and it should be
114:39 - like not so much clouds or too many
114:40 - clouds so all right well great i'm
114:42 - looking forward to running around
114:43 - phoenix park with you tomorrow me too
114:46 - cheers
114:47 - likewise thanks again david
114:50 - yeah
114:52 - oh perfect
114:59 - hey james phillips thank you
115:01 - doing my best
115:02 - and next we have
115:04 - a man
115:07 - whom i have worked very closely with for
115:09 - years
115:11 - every still
115:13 - thank you so much for making it out here
115:15 - and perhaps you can just give us
115:18 - i'll give you a very quick introduction
115:19 - so evaristo has basically been leading
115:22 - free code camp's data science effort he
115:25 - is one of the most prominent people in
115:26 - the data science chat room on gitter
115:29 - and he's done a number of different
115:32 - analyses both on medium and on kaggle of
115:35 - different data sets we've we've made
115:37 - public
115:38 - um of course when we make
115:39 - data sets public we're very responsible
115:41 - about the disclosure and you know
115:43 - cognizant of privacy concerns and things
115:45 - like that so we have these huge public
115:47 - data sets and every so has analyzed them
115:50 - extensively thank you for joining us
115:52 - every so yeah
115:53 - no not everything i'm eduardo edward i'm
115:55 - sorry yeah yeah i'm eduardo vidis from
115:58 - portugal
115:59 - i'm sorry i gotta make something you
116:01 - make stuff
116:04 - yeah so tell us a little bit about um
116:08 - i feel so embarrassed
116:10 - yeah
116:10 - um so so tell us a little about uh about
116:14 - what you're working on out in portugal
116:16 - uh eduardo and and you're leading the
116:18 - study group there
116:20 - well
116:20 - i first knew free code camp in the
116:23 - beginning of 2017
116:25 - and i was a civil engineering and i was
116:28 - not happy with my career i wanted to
116:30 - reboot into into programming
116:33 - and when i'm at free code camp i'm at
116:35 - the right path
116:37 - to start learning how to program i've
116:38 - tried a lot of boot camps without effort
116:42 - but with free code camp it was very very
116:45 - easy to to follow follow up
116:48 - and and at the same time that i was
116:51 - studying
116:52 - i started to motivate people to study
116:54 - with me
116:56 - i started at the same time as juan
116:58 - enrique and together we started the
117:01 - study group in our
117:02 - city
117:04 - and we impulsionated also the starting
117:07 - of the study group in lisbon the capital
117:09 - of portugal
117:12 - and we are doing
117:13 - that effort
117:15 - every week
117:17 - even after we get
117:18 - got our jobs
117:20 - yeah i've rebooted my career in
117:23 - five months studying
117:25 - more or less 10 hours per day but it was
117:28 - nats it was five months and i got from
117:31 - civil engineering to a front-end
117:33 - developer
117:34 - yeah and so eduardo you said within five
117:37 - months you were able to transition from
117:38 - civil engineer to developer just
117:40 - studying on your own
117:42 - yeah yeah correct uh
117:45 - because when i found uh free code camp i
117:47 - found the right pass i i was in a big
117:49 - doubt of what i should study first and
117:52 - what i should study after that
117:54 - and with frequent camp i got the correct
117:56 - path and i followed that path and it
117:59 - worked very well
118:00 - i also
118:02 - got a mentor uh thank you miguel coque
118:05 - for supporting me
118:07 - uh uh mentor is uh
118:09 - he was very helpful in in my study
118:12 - um
118:14 - and i got the job very quick with
118:16 - with this help and with the help of free
118:18 - code
118:19 - yeah yeah
118:20 - so
118:22 - you even though you've gotten a
118:23 - full-time job and and you've made the
118:26 - successful transition
118:28 - you're still giving back to the
118:30 - community and you're still helping run
118:32 - the local study group talk talk a little
118:34 - bit about the the group and how you how
118:36 - your leadership of it yeah
118:38 - of course we have we have two main
118:40 - events we have one event that we call
118:42 - the social event uh
118:45 - where
118:46 - where we try
118:47 - to join the local community of senior
118:49 - programmers with the students and we
118:52 - have a second event called the study
118:53 - group where we focus just on solving
118:56 - challenges
118:57 - uh and it's working
118:59 - great it's amazing
119:01 - how people are are motivating and are
119:04 - studying and are growing with us
119:06 - step by step and when they are ready to
119:09 - enter in the in in the market we have
119:12 - jobs for them really
119:14 - yeah um it's it's great it's amazing
119:17 - yeah
119:18 - so
119:19 - uh
119:20 - when you say people are able to enter
119:22 - the job market how many people within
119:24 - your study group have gotten developer
119:26 - jobs do you think yeah
119:29 - first quincy let me tell you that we are
119:31 - in the south of portugal so it's a small
119:33 - town like 50 000
119:35 - inhabitants and
119:37 - in the last year we got five five
119:39 - developers ready to start working and
119:41 - they started working so i think it's a
119:43 - nice percentage
119:46 - so basically one out of 10 000 people in
119:48 - your town has gotten a developer job
119:51 - thanks largely to your efforts and your
119:52 - community outreach
119:54 - also
119:56 - after that i started started writing on
119:59 - medium because i felt
120:01 - the the needs to contribute more to free
120:04 - code camp uh so i started to to write
120:06 - about react that's the the main area in
120:10 - which i'm working nowadays
120:13 - yeah
120:14 - well
120:14 - thank you for writing these articles so
120:17 - in portugal of course you speak
120:19 - portuguese and and it's also a huge
120:21 - language in brazil and brazil is i think
120:23 - the third largest country
120:25 - for free co-camp in terms of total
120:27 - number of people who who use it
120:29 - and frequently i talk to developers from
120:32 - portugal
120:33 - from brazil and other portuguese
120:35 - speaking countries
120:36 - and they have there's definitely
120:39 - a strong desire to have to be able to
120:41 - read
120:42 - about technical concepts
120:44 - in their native portuguese
120:46 - and since you've already started writing
120:48 - articles i'm just going to put this out
120:49 - there eduardo would you be interested at
120:52 - some point in potentially writing
120:54 - articles about technology in portuguese
120:56 - yeah yeah of course totally agree with
120:59 - that uh
121:00 - i want to to to start writing in
121:02 - portuguese for the big communities that
121:04 - we have because portuguese is the fifth
121:07 - most spoke spoke language in the world
121:10 - but at the same time i feel the need
121:12 - to motivate people to learn english
121:14 - because when you start working in a
121:16 - remote team or something like that you
121:18 - need to interact with people from all
121:20 - over the world so uh in spite of having
121:24 - uh
121:25 - a way to learn in portuguese you also
121:27 - need to train your english skills
121:29 - i think that that's very
121:31 - that's important to train your english
121:33 - skills
121:36 - of the people
121:38 - uh in your study group
121:40 - that are getting jobs how many of them
121:43 - are getting jobs at local companies
121:45 - versus i don't know how many uh
121:48 - multinational corporations and have like
121:50 - branches
121:51 - there but what would you say the ratio
121:53 - of like local employers
121:56 - and small businesses versus
121:58 - multinational employers
122:00 - okay uh basically portugal is very
122:03 - trendy now so i have some difficulty to
122:05 - do this
122:06 - this this calculus but i can say that
122:09 - three in two got remote jobs
122:12 - in the
122:13 - north of europe um so two are working
122:16 - locally but basically that two local
122:19 - companies are startups that are based on
122:22 - germany or in the netherlands or in
122:25 - sweden
122:26 - so i think
122:28 - we can speak of 100 of international
122:30 - internationalization
122:33 - that's great well what are some of your
122:35 - goals now that you've gotten a developer
122:36 - job you've you've gotten this community
122:38 - running
122:39 - you've proven out
122:42 - the notion that people can
122:44 - come into your community they can learn
122:46 - to code you will help them
122:48 - build up their skills help them build up
122:49 - their network and that they can get jobs
122:51 - now that you've proven that and you have
122:54 - this proven path
122:55 - to help people in your community get
122:57 - developer jobs what are your goals for
123:01 - the near future
123:03 - well for the near future i have to do i
123:06 - have two main goals one is
123:08 - to become a senior developer in my team
123:11 - contributing more for the for the future
123:13 - of the architecture in the web
123:16 - application uh but in a second plan not
123:20 - less important than the first i want to
123:23 - continue thriving and to motivate people
123:26 - uh to learn to how to program on
123:28 - frequent camp i will say i'm a free code
123:30 - camp evangelist because i really believe
123:32 - in free code camp because i've tried a
123:34 - lot of other boot camps and i didn't
123:37 - have uh success and i think free code
123:40 - campf as the the main ingredients uh to
123:43 - turn you into a successful programmer in
123:47 - less than one year
123:48 - yeah so i think people should try free
123:51 - code camp they should join they should
123:54 - try the challenge they
123:56 - they need to speak with people and to
123:59 - surpass the challenges and learn how to
124:01 - program they have everything every tool
124:03 - they need it's on their hands at the
124:06 - first moment they sign up to free
124:09 - all right well thank you so much eduardo
124:11 - for joining us thank you very much i'm
124:13 - sorry for my english i'm not a native
124:15 - speaker your english is excellent
124:17 - thank you very much
124:19 - thank you very much mr larson
124:21 - you're great yeah it was nice to meet

124:27 - course all right well we'll have fun
124:29 - running tomorrow yeah
124:31 - all right
124:32 - awkward fist bump
124:35 - all right next
124:37 - robert have a seat man thank you thank
124:39 - you welcome
124:44 - yeah so uh
124:46 - thank you for flying in from vienna yeah
124:49 - you lead the free cocaine vienna group
124:51 - along with daniel deutsch who who
124:53 - couldn't make it uh he's a student
124:56 - uh tell us a little bit about the
124:58 - origins of free co-camp vienna which i
125:00 - think you said is about three years old
125:02 - now yeah it is it is um
125:04 - yeah it's like there's so much to say
125:06 - but
125:07 - um
125:08 - it basically started i i
125:11 - now have a developer job and i mainly
125:14 - attribute that to free co-cap which is
125:16 - awesome
125:17 - and when i started as a student shortly
125:19 - after there's this there was i think it
125:21 - still is but this is getting started
125:23 - guide and you're getting courage to
125:24 - check up your local group there was no
125:26 - local group but there was a nice guide
125:27 - saying if there is no local group start
125:29 - a facebook group this is how you do it
125:30 - so i did
125:32 - and then
125:33 - no one came so i asked my wife to join i
125:35 - invited her we were two then like this
125:37 - is probably just in the span of a couple
125:39 - of days there were still no more people
125:41 - joining so i got impatient so i think i
125:43 - texted you on gitter or something i was
125:45 - like i don't know if quincy larson will
125:46 - reply to me but he replied and it was
125:49 - awesome and i was asking can i start a
125:51 - meetup.com group because i knew meetups
125:53 - from my city there's a quite a bit of
125:54 - them
125:56 - thinking that that's the way i could get
125:57 - more people involved because i wanted to
125:59 - meet other students right
126:01 - um and then i did that and you replied
126:03 - like yeah of course sure just keep in
126:05 - mind it cost money and stuff and i was
126:06 - like that's fine
126:07 - so that's basically how it started in
126:09 - the format that we have now
126:11 - um we've been going almost three years
126:13 - like this i think november or december
126:16 - and
126:17 - we basically have it where i always try
126:19 - to say that this is the local group for
126:21 - frequent vienna this is a meet-up but if
126:23 - anyone wants to help in any way you know
126:26 - i'm just here now helping it to grow
126:29 - starting and keep it going
126:32 - so we have a format normally now of one
126:35 - or two talks
126:36 - and some group coding or some group
126:38 - discussion whatever people want to do
126:39 - just to keep a monthly thing where
126:41 - people can meet other students which is
126:44 - yeah what i've been doing yeah
126:47 - awesome and
126:48 - so it sounds like you have a very
126:50 - supportive wife who's
126:52 - how has that
126:53 - helped you because i also benefit from
126:55 - an incredibly supportive wife
126:57 - jade i don't know if you're watching
126:58 - thanks
126:59 - uh and i none of the free code camp
127:01 - would be possible if uh if jade hadn't
127:04 - believed in me and
127:05 - let me take an extended uh departure
127:08 - from working full-time so i could so i
127:10 - could build free code camp and start
127:12 - trying to try to build up the initial
127:14 - community um so
127:17 - talk a little bit about your your
127:18 - relationship with your wife and how is
127:20 - she learning to code as well no no
127:24 - yeah i think she could benefit from
127:25 - learning i don't i think she doesn't
127:26 - know what she's missing out on but
127:28 - yeah she's been super supportive um
127:32 - in the beginning there
127:34 - um
127:36 - maybe we can touch a little bit on
127:37 - because i used to work a longer career
127:40 - of all sorts of jobs from
127:42 - theater stagehand to customer service to
127:44 - sales to you know selling newspapers on
127:47 - the phone selling software i was working
127:49 - actually here in dublin for two years in
127:51 - xerox and also in oracle but mainly
127:54 - support or like phone sales so i was
127:57 - exposed to technology and i've always
127:59 - loved computers since young age but for
128:01 - some reason i figured programming was
128:03 - harder than i like i imagined it to be
128:05 - this
128:06 - really hard thing
128:08 - so long story short then back to
128:11 - i was starting a um
128:14 - agency kind of company with a with a
128:16 - friend while working full time so in my
128:18 - spare time and my wife is so supportive
128:21 - so um
128:23 - when she was watching tv or series i was
128:25 - sitting on my computer trying to make
128:27 - some business happen right and i did
128:28 - that before i learned to code with
128:30 - wordpress sites and themes and prepaid
128:32 - you know themes and plugins and stuff
128:34 - and
128:37 - that led eventually to me being curious
128:40 - we are doing shared hosting can i do the
128:42 - hosting myself and we have a better
128:43 - margin so i that's for the first time i
128:45 - get exposed to online courses like
128:48 - treehouse and linux academy where i was
128:50 - realizing it's hard easier than i
128:52 - thought
128:53 - to learn
128:55 - these technical skills that i was
128:57 - interested in but a bit afraid of
128:59 - so that led to me discovering that oh i
129:02 - should probably try and do this with the
129:04 - programming as well again
129:06 - and uh
129:07 - it really clicked with me but it wasn't
129:09 - until i really was like oh i can do this
129:12 - i got the belief that this is not as
129:13 - hard as i thought
129:15 - but it was mainly via free code campus
129:17 - sort of my
129:19 - base or like
129:21 - my go-to place for learning that i kind
129:24 - of got the ball rolling and really got
129:26 - into learning and through all of this my
129:28 - wife has been super supportive because
129:30 - as i said you know like she would do
129:33 - leicester's leisure stuff at the evening
129:35 - and i would you know be on social doing
129:37 - my stuff
129:39 - which works but it can only work for
129:41 - that long kind of you have to find a
129:43 - balance yeah
129:45 - yeah well i wasn't aware that you'd had
129:47 - such a whining career and and done so
129:49 - many different things and it's great
129:50 - that you've worked here in dublin
129:52 - uh
129:53 - so
129:54 - it sounds like are you originally from
129:56 - vienna
129:59 - i'm i'm from norway
130:01 - um
130:04 - i worked here in dublin and that's where
130:05 - i met my now wife she's austrian so we
130:08 - moved to norway we got we established a
130:10 - family and then we moved to
130:12 - vienna her home city like five years ago
130:15 - yeah
130:16 - wow so
130:18 - it sounds like you all have really
130:19 - benefited from the eu's like ability to
130:22 - fluidly move between countries because
130:24 - you've been moving a lot yeah yeah for
130:25 - sure for sure
130:26 - no way it's not in the eu we're in this
130:28 - collaboration like switzerland and uh
130:31 - us and i can't remember luxembourg i
130:33 - think
130:34 - but it makes it basically
130:36 - i can only remember the norwegian one
130:37 - efta but it's something like that
130:39 - e-e-a-a or whatever oh okay yeah i
130:41 - thought it was when i was in customs
130:42 - yeah it's a like special line for people
130:45 - who are in the eu
130:47 - uh
130:48 - switzerland ch yeah and then like the
130:50 - eea yeah i think that's what it is yeah
130:52 - but that's really nice because basically
130:54 - that and schengen so that the passport
130:56 - agreement makes it so it's really easy
130:59 - to visit anything in europe and it's
131:01 - really easy depending on the country to
131:02 - get like a work workers license or just
131:05 - the extended visa you don't even have to
131:07 - apply often so that's nice
131:09 - and yeah so if you're curious about like
131:12 - working abroad then europe
131:14 - europeans should like more europeans
131:17 - should avail of that
131:18 - yeah
131:19 - yeah so
131:21 - now that you're
131:23 - leading the study group what are some of
131:24 - your goals
131:26 - for free co camp vienna and for your own
131:28 - personal career
131:29 - for 2019. yeah oh that's nice um
131:33 - i'm
131:34 - i'm really grateful that i have daniel
131:36 - deutsch with me he's been i think about
131:38 - two years my co-organizer and co-host
131:42 - i also run two other meetups now over a
131:43 - year one is for vue.js and one is for
131:46 - golang
131:47 - which because i love this interjection
131:49 - of meeting people getting to know them
131:52 - help them if i can and this like mix of
131:54 - people in code which is awesome
131:56 - um
131:57 - so i know that even if i take a break or
132:00 - slow down free cold camp vienna is still
132:02 - going to be there because daniel deutsch
132:04 - is just running the show and it's
132:06 - seamlessly it's perfect
132:07 - with the other meetups i'm slowing down
132:09 - now because um i think what i want to
132:12 - happen in let's say 2019 to put a number
132:15 - on it or yeah is to switch
132:18 - a little bit my career from pure
132:19 - developer to doing more developer
132:21 - relations in one form with another my
132:23 - dream
132:24 - future would be where i get to do
132:26 - professionally what i do
132:27 - um
132:28 - as a hobby you know with the meetups so
132:32 - if i can be more you know conferences
132:35 - traveling online forums doing community
132:37 - work and that be the focus of my um
132:40 - yeah professional career that's where i
132:42 - want to navigate towards
132:44 - and but i still want to do some coding
132:46 - even if it's like demos or prototyping
132:48 - or preparing technical talks and stuff
132:50 - like this
132:51 - yeah
132:53 - awesome well thank you so much for

134:31 - it's
134:32 - it's incredibly helpful tell us a little
134:34 - about how you got into tech and how you
134:37 - started
134:38 - deciding to record all this and share
134:40 - all this knowledge okay
134:42 - uh well i wanted to learn and firstly i
134:45 - wanted to learn
134:46 - for me and for myself but i knew that
134:50 - eventually i wanted to find a job and i
134:53 - wanted to be sure that everything i know
134:55 - i can also
134:57 - like
134:58 - go to another person and maybe teach
135:00 - them so i said okay how can i do that so
135:04 - start coding in my computer as always
135:06 - and then i'm going to record these
135:07 - videos and if they're very good then i'm
135:10 - going to upload them so basically that's
135:12 - how i started i wanted to pass this
135:15 - knowledge to other people and make sure
135:17 - that i also know these things
135:20 - that's great and
135:23 - i think it takes a lot of courage to put
135:24 - yourself out there and to record videos
135:28 - about
135:29 - a topic that you yourself or are just
135:31 - learning
135:33 - how did you get the courage to go out
135:35 - there and what was your thought process
135:37 - like
135:40 - because i always wanted to get better i
135:43 - thought that i should start from
135:45 - somewhere i should really start from
135:48 - somewhere because if it's only me that's
135:50 - studying in my own little room then it's
135:53 - not going to be
135:54 - anything i wanted to to pass this
135:57 - knowledge to everyone else and yes
136:00 - i'm still learning i don't know
136:02 - everything in angular but it's something
136:04 - that i like doing so i'm doing it
136:08 - great and
136:09 - your videos have been very popular
136:12 - and we've had so many people who've
136:14 - asked for more
136:15 - content on angular so it's perfect
136:18 - that you started creating these great
136:20 - videos
136:21 - what are some things that you plan to do
136:24 - 2018 is almost over coming into the end
136:27 - of 2018 2019
136:29 - what do you plan to focus on for the
136:31 - near future in terms of creating videos
136:34 - creating articles and
136:36 - teaching other people about technology
136:40 - i have a few plans on my mind
136:43 - as far as angular is concerned i would
136:46 - like to focus more on angular and
136:49 - angular material so i would like to
136:50 - create some videos based on angularjs
136:53 - and maybe mix it with a material library
136:56 - i would really love to do that but other
136:59 - than that i'm also interested in ux and
137:01 - ui design so i was also thinking to
137:03 - contribute and make some videos in ux
137:06 - and ui design
137:08 - and other than that i also have like
137:10 - some plans about teaching maybe
137:12 - javascript like volunteering and i would
137:15 - love to go in some other conferences
137:17 - that i have in mind and maybe if i could
137:20 - help them and also pass some knowledge i
137:22 - would love to do that um it can be quite
137:24 - scary because as you mentioned i'm still
137:26 - learning and i'm still quite new but i
137:29 - believe that if it's something that you
137:31 - love and it's something you like then
137:32 - you should do it no matter what
137:35 - you seem to have a very strong passion
137:38 - for learning
137:39 - and a desire to improve yourself and
137:41 - expand your horizons
137:44 - tell us a little bit more about your
137:46 - background and
137:47 - how you got to be so adventurous
137:51 - uh well it's true i'm very passionate
137:54 - and i really want to improve myself so
137:57 - when i was 18 um i had to make a
138:00 - decision and just study something
138:03 - in my country in greece you have to give
138:05 - some final exams
138:07 - and i wanted to go into an engineering
138:09 - school i wasn't that good and my exams
138:11 - weren't that good so i didn't really
138:14 - pass but then because my sister was in
138:16 - this university i got an opportunity to
138:18 - pass because she was also there and as
138:21 - soon as i got in i really liked
138:24 - everything but the problem was that you
138:27 - only get the basics from back-ends like
138:29 - java and some php and some basics on uh
138:32 - printed development like html css and
138:35 - javascript and then i knew that if i
138:37 - wanted to get a job that wasn't enough i
138:39 - had to study on my own and first i found
138:42 - an article on medium and they suggested
138:45 - free code camp so
138:48 - i went there and i at first i didn't
138:50 - know what freak.com was i started doing
138:53 - the first challenges which was about
138:55 - html and css and so i fell in love with
138:58 - it so i continue building yeah
139:03 - yeah but that's the truth because i i
139:06 - continued building and i saw that i
139:08 - could progress and i could learn stuff
139:10 - and i could have some the most important
139:12 - thing was that i could have some of
139:14 - those projects in my portfolio so i also
139:17 - beat the portfolio and i had these
139:19 - challenges and uh it was really awesome
139:22 - yeah
139:24 - well thank you so much elotheria for
139:26 - coming out here from greece and
139:29 - thank you for everything you're doing to
139:32 - encourage people to learn to code
139:34 - i think a lot of people when they watch
139:36 - your videos
139:37 - they are not only they learn a lot but
139:39 - they get really motivated because you're
139:41 - just such an enthusiastic person and i
139:43 - think that really carries through in the
139:45 - videos
139:47 - all right well are you gonna are you
139:48 - gonna come out and run with us tomorrow
139:50 - i don't think so i have plans so with
139:53 - the family they are here with me so yeah
139:56 - okay wow you said your family came here
139:58 - with you my dad and my sister yeah great
140:02 - well what what is something exciting to
140:04 - do that you plan to do while you're in
140:05 - here in dublin
140:06 - well uh tomorrow we are planning on go
140:09 - on a tour in ireland so not only dublin
140:12 - and i'm really looking forward to it
140:14 - because maybe i won't ever have a chance
140:17 - to visit dublin again or even ireland so
140:19 - i really want to go there i like
140:21 - traveling and exploring so it will be a
140:23 - great opportunity for me to do that
140:26 - awesome well we're so excited that you
140:28 - were able to bring your family with you

140:34 - thank you thank you very much
140:38 - all right i'm going to pop
140:39 - ella theria's information up on the
140:41 - screen i encourage you to follow her on
140:43 - twitter
140:44 - and we're going to get the next uh
140:46 - interviewee
140:48 - oh great thank you you're very fast
140:51 - all right next uh
140:54 - let's bring him in
140:56 - the the man
140:58 - the main man
141:00 - i am thrilled to finally hang out with
141:02 - you in person we've spent
141:05 - my gosh
141:06 - hundreds of hours so many hours
141:11 - oh ben mcmahon
141:14 - yeah ben is
141:16 - a prolific contributor to free co camp i
141:18 - think i've spent more time pairing with
141:20 - him than pretty much anybody
141:22 - in the free code camp
141:25 - uh community
141:26 - let me let me let me just let me just
141:28 - recount some of the things you worked on
141:29 - so
141:30 - you were
141:32 - you were very heavily involved in the
141:34 - javascript curriculum which pretty much
141:36 - everybody who's watching this has
141:37 - probably tried at some point um you
141:40 - created the challenge-o-matic which was
141:42 - the tool to make it easier to contribute
141:44 - challenges which we're not actively
141:45 - using anymore but it's an inspiration
141:47 - for what we're building the the
141:49 - challenge dramatic i think yours was the
141:51 - challenge of
141:52 - 5000 name at all oh that was how i just
141:52 - probably not a fan matic
141:55 - take memories why is it one day i'm like
141:57 - it sounds cool yeah well i think this
141:59 - next one's gonna be challenge-o-matic
142:01 - 5001. perfect that's exactly the very
142:04 - thing should work
142:05 - just start a random high number and keep
142:07 - increasing it yeah that way people will
142:08 - think there have been so many iterations
142:10 - to get us to where it is well tell us a
142:12 - little about yourself you're here in
142:14 - dublin right yes so i am based here i am
142:17 - currently kind of a college student
142:19 - uh detergent my degree is all work
142:22 - placement
142:23 - so i'm currently a working man for a
142:25 - year um
142:27 - in kernel development actually which is
142:28 - a complete pivot from javascript but
142:31 - curl development kernel oh like linux
142:33 - kernel okay i was like girl like the
142:35 - command
142:36 - how much can you really do that kernel
142:38 - development okay so talk a little bit
142:40 - about uh what you're doing with kernel
142:42 - development and where you're working
142:43 - so i'm in arista and there's the
142:45 - networks they've been the same market as
142:47 - cisco and juniper and those guys um
142:51 - mainly what i'm working on is
142:53 - you're most york revolves around you're
142:54 - dealing with you know
142:56 - they're linux boxes but they're links
142:57 - boxes with a lot of network cards which
142:59 - linux you know
143:01 - it works fine with it but it's not you
143:02 - know the first purpose so there are a
143:04 - few tweaks and changes that you made
143:06 - um
143:07 - and yeah that's kind of my day job now
143:09 - at the moment um it's very interesting
143:11 - because i'm learning c and current
143:12 - development
143:13 - and a lot of other concepts all the same
143:15 - time on the job
143:16 - which is an interesting uh take deciding
143:19 - stuff up for about sherlock
143:21 - yeah and
143:22 - so
143:23 - you're
143:24 - doing you you've gone from doing
143:27 - primarily web development which is what
143:28 - you're doing with free code came to
143:30 - really diving many layers of abstraction
143:32 - down i'm on the opposite end of like the
143:34 - spectrum at this stage yeah um no it's
143:36 - something i got a choice when i
143:38 - got the internship there to pick a team
143:40 - when i was going i need to pick
143:41 - something that i know nothing about um
143:43 - interesting that's also how i started
143:44 - free code camp was i tried to help i
143:47 - distinctly remember helping you at like
143:49 - 2 a.m with riding jade
143:52 - five years ago or four years ago now
143:55 - back in the cloud close the streams
143:57 - bring back to all the streams
143:59 - bring back closet streams well i'm happy
144:01 - to report that i no longer live in the
144:02 - bay area in a one bedroom apartment and
144:04 - i actually have an entire house with
144:07 - little kids running around it now so
144:09 - i have a spare bedroom that my in-laws
144:12 - stay in when they visit
144:13 - and i've i can stream from there we
144:15 - should absolutely get on and do a stream
144:17 - at some point there has to be a closet
144:19 - though it's not the same it's not a
144:20 - cloud boat okay so we do have a closet
144:22 - it's just very hot and i'm small what
144:24 - could i say i did my time in the the
144:27 - freako camp closet and now i want to sit
144:29 - in a proper room free close the camp
144:33 - so
144:33 - what are some uh
144:36 - you've been
144:37 - active in the free coaching community
144:39 - you've primarily been focused on your
144:40 - new job
144:41 - and your your internship before that
144:43 - which
144:44 - involved probably an incredible amount
144:46 - of learning
144:47 - are you
144:48 - are you interested in coming back and
144:50 - continuing to contribute to the free co
144:52 - camp community in the near future oh i'm
144:54 - dying to get back uh the problem with
144:56 - working with coding full-time is you
144:58 - have to you do actually have to live to
144:59 - some degree because these days i'll come
145:01 - home and i'll be like i don't want to
145:02 - write any record i want to go to bed
145:04 - um
145:05 - but yeah i'm hoping to find some time to
145:06 - start getting back into it it takes i
145:09 - want to like block off a week or
145:10 - something to reacquaint myself with the
145:11 - code base and stuff before i dive back
145:13 - in because it's definitely changed and
145:15 - excuse me in the
145:16 - year or so i've been on active
145:19 - yeah for about a year
145:20 - well great well uh stuart's actively
145:22 - working on making the curriculum a lot
145:25 - more accessible of course stewart's only
145:26 - a few hours drive from you if you
145:28 - uh ever want to pair a program in real
145:30 - life which is kind of a clean thing that
145:32 - we used to do back in the day right back
145:34 - in the day
145:35 - so
145:37 - i think we should stop
145:39 - talking about tech and talk about this
145:40 - wonderful city
145:42 - that you call home where we're having
145:44 - this event
145:45 - as far as i know you're the only person
145:47 - i've talked to tonight who
145:49 - lives here i've talked to a few people
145:51 - who've lived here uh for shorter periods
145:53 - of time but what is dublin all about if
145:55 - you had to describe dublin how would you
145:57 - describe it
145:58 - jesus was not prepared for that um
146:04 - god one one word okay one word's tough
146:07 - it doesn't have to be one word i didn't
146:09 - impose that restriction
146:11 - i'm trying to be concise though as well
146:12 - like dublin's such a strange place
146:14 - because it's got like you have google
146:17 - and then you'll have like a pub next
146:18 - door with an old man drinking guinness
146:20 - in it it's kind of got like a foot in
146:21 - both of those worlds uh and it's very
146:24 - interesting culturally from that point
146:25 - of view
146:26 - um
146:27 - it's kind of it's a country that's grown
146:29 - up really fast
146:31 - and it's become really progressive of
146:32 - late um
146:34 - so it's it's a it's a happening place
146:36 - for definite um you can't see it anymore
146:39 - but if you looked at the windows earlier
146:40 - you can see cranes everywhere there's a
146:41 - huge amount of construction a huge
146:43 - amount of development
146:44 - um we're very lucky as well like you've
146:46 - no shortage of tech companies around
146:47 - here so for people
146:49 - definitely in europe it's a good
146:51 - destination to kind of pick if you're
146:52 - looking for somewhere to you know
146:54 - start a career in tech because there are
146:56 - a lot of places and they're doing a lot
146:57 - of hiring at the moment um
147:00 - but other than that like i like to think
147:02 - that people are friendly enough they're
147:03 - funny to me because i'm from here i
147:04 - guess but
147:05 - um it's it's definitely an interesting
147:07 - culture it's funny when i go to the
147:08 - states one of the first things i miss is
147:09 - the people and because it's a very
147:11 - different like interpersonal culture
147:13 - there
147:14 - um and it's nice but you do you do miss
147:17 - the the kind of i don't know
147:19 - everything has to be witty only has to
147:20 - be sarcastic all that kind of stuff and
147:22 - it's just it's the funny little things
147:23 - like that just kind of miss
147:24 - yeah so in in dublin people are
147:26 - constantly kind of like it's
147:28 - i mean do you think it's like a city of
147:30 - kind of
147:31 - entertainers and jokers kind of
147:33 - everybody's trying to figure out a
147:35 - clever way to put things
147:37 - well they always kind of portray the
147:39 - irish as that kind of like quick-witted
147:41 - like smart art type of character and you
147:43 - know maybe they're right um
147:46 - i like to think i'm pretty all right
147:48 - but no like huh
147:51 - you probably shouldn't um
147:53 - but
147:55 - no yeah like i think there's a lot of
147:56 - value place
147:58 - placed on your words and you better wait
147:59 - and you know i think it comes across
148:01 - when you meet people they're normally
148:02 - you know decent speakers and you know up
148:05 - for a chat
148:06 - and
148:07 - someone were a bit too up for a chat but
148:08 - that's a different story altogether
148:11 - yeah well what are some things that uh
148:14 - aside from kernel development and
148:16 - hopefully getting back into free cooking
148:18 - contribution what are some areas of
148:20 - technology since you're somebody who
148:22 - is you know at many different places in
148:25 - the stack and has a pretty good
148:27 - bird's eye view on on how things are
148:29 - moving what are some things that really
148:30 - excite you about
148:32 - tech information technology and the way
148:34 - things are going
148:39 - in terms of new things um
148:41 - i guess there's a lot of scope for
148:45 - i guess
148:46 - like this is trying to unlock but the
148:47 - entire integration of
148:49 - technology and people
148:51 - i feel like there's a lot of issues that
148:52 - are not serious enough that they've
148:55 - needed a solution in the past but it
148:57 - becomes so easy to solve that they will
148:58 - be
148:59 - um
149:01 - a great example is the the whole health
149:03 - technology kind of revolution the way
149:05 - everyone's get their heart rate consumed
149:06 - and all that kind of stuff um there's
149:08 - been many cases of people finding that
149:10 - they have asip or atrial fibrillation if
149:12 - you want the full visible thing uh
149:14 - because of their smart watch i think
149:15 - there's an article really recently an
149:16 - apple watch that alerted the person to
149:18 - it um and it's stuff like that that can
149:21 - you know makes huge differences to lives
149:23 - because they're you know if you find out
149:24 - you've atrial fibrillation you need to
149:25 - get it sorted and it's fine
149:27 - if you sort it and if you don't you get
149:29 - yourself a lot of trouble so
149:31 - there's all kinds of applications of
149:32 - health technology in particular that are
149:34 - not only really exciting because they're
149:36 - cool but they're also really exciting
149:37 - because they're good they're doing a
149:39 - good thing in the world
149:42 - that's a really good answer so
149:45 - are you planning to event i mean do you
149:48 - want to like
149:49 - ten years out you're so young first of
149:51 - all i think this uh this guy was one of
149:54 - the youngest free co camp contributors
149:56 - uh how old were you when you started
149:58 - contributing to free cocaine
150:00 - what year is there 2018
150:03 - it was like four years ago almost 16
150:05 - then yeah
150:06 - yeah and so you're you're
150:09 - right at the beginning of your career
150:11 - did you did you end up going to
150:12 - university or yeah yeah so this this
150:15 - year of work is my third year of college
150:17 - effectively and then i have to go back
150:18 - one more year um
150:20 - so yeah i kind of i took the weird right
150:21 - because i did the self teaching and the
150:23 - free code camp and in the classical
150:25 - training as well so i've kind of done
150:27 - all of it
150:28 - in a weird way
150:30 - so
150:31 - knowing that you know techn you know
150:33 - health technology and preventative
150:35 - medicine all that is
150:36 - is an area that there's tremendous
150:38 - potential for
150:39 - improving people's quality of life and
150:41 - it can be you know a huge industry
150:44 - knowing that and knowing what you know
150:46 - about uh kernel development and knowing
150:48 - what you know about web development what
150:50 - would you say the the
150:52 - long-term direction you hope to take
150:54 - your career in at this point is
150:57 - i actually am very happy where i am i'm
150:59 - serious it's a very good company to work
151:00 - for and i find my work really
151:01 - interesting
151:03 - um i try not to worry too much about the
151:06 - future the nice thing about tech is that
151:08 - when you get yourself to a certain
151:09 - standard you don't have to worry too
151:10 - much about you know you're not going to
151:12 - be unemployed probably
151:14 - for any great period of time so i i do
151:17 - like a degree of you know
151:18 - let the river take me wherever and see
151:20 - what happens for now i definitely for
151:22 - the next five years i can see myself
151:23 - staying in arista um but i have no plans
151:26 - even beyond that so i'm looking forward
151:27 - to seeing what opportunities do present
151:29 - themselves
151:31 - all right well thank you so much for
151:33 - joining us here and
151:34 - yeah coming out and giving us some local
151:36 - flavor that's it that's what i'm here
151:38 - for quincy it's great to talk to you
151:39 - live yeah great to talk to you in person
151:42 - in the flesh that's it
151:45 - hey coming up matt
151:48 - yeah
151:49 - welcome
151:51 - matt uh tell us a little bit about your
151:53 - background
151:54 - and what you're doing
151:56 - so i'm i'm originally a music teacher i
151:59 - studied music at university
152:01 - um taught guitar on piano for several
152:03 - years
152:04 - um and then which i still do actually
152:06 - just a little bit um in the evenings and
152:08 - weekends
152:09 - but i realized
152:10 - um
152:12 - it wasn't the career for me i wanted
152:14 - something which had a bit more direction
152:16 - had more of a challenge
152:17 - um
152:18 - and i met a friend who i'd not seen in a
152:20 - long time and
152:22 - he studied music with me and he was like
152:24 - oh i'm a developer now i was like how
152:25 - did how did that happen and uh i knew
152:27 - that well i found a lot of courses
152:29 - online and sort of taught myself and
152:31 - then a couple of years later and
152:32 - developers like that's incredible and uh
152:34 - so
152:35 - i started just looking around different
152:36 - resources um
152:38 - and
152:39 - this was
152:41 - so this was uh like three and a half
152:43 - years ago four years ago
152:44 - um so i was started with
152:47 - a lot of courses on coursera edx and
152:49 - those kind of things which were really
152:50 - good because they had these kind of
152:51 - deadlines so you had to get the
152:55 - project in by a certain time and then
152:56 - people peer-reviewed them um
152:59 - and then listened to a lot of podcasts
153:01 - and i think
153:02 - i feel it was probably javascript java
153:04 - you were on and you were talking about
153:05 - free code camp or maybe it was code
153:07 - newbie maybe both
153:08 - and um and i heard about free code camp
153:10 - and started trying that out and and
153:13 - realized actually this is this
153:14 - incredible free platform um
153:18 - and yeah just got really into it and got
153:21 - quite disciplined about doing it every
153:23 - day
153:25 - and then uh and then i heard about these
153:27 - meetups that were going on and um which
153:29 - at first i was i'm not good enough to go
153:31 - along to these i bet everyone's amazing
153:32 - and
153:33 - you know very
153:35 - uh i was quite intimidated but i forced
153:37 - myself to go
153:38 - and then met people who were very
153:40 - similar to me you know some people who
153:41 - were above me some people who weren't
153:43 - quite where i was and
153:44 - um
153:45 - and found that really and suddenly it
153:47 - was oh you know maybe i can do this and
153:51 - yeah it's gone from there really
153:53 - that's awesome so
153:55 - describe the transition uh
153:58 - you're a musician
154:00 - and just looking at
154:03 - the different steps you would need to
154:04 - take and planning out your progression
154:06 - as
154:07 - it became clearer and clearer to you
154:09 - what you needed to do yeah
154:11 - i think yeah to begin with it's it's
154:13 - fine just to
154:14 - accept you're not going to learn
154:15 - everything in one go i think some people
154:17 - think
154:17 - they maybe do it for a week and think oh
154:20 - i feel like i don't know too much yeah
154:22 - i'm never going to be able to do this
154:23 - it's so this just it can be overwhelming
154:25 - um it's good just to yeah just do it
154:27 - initially which i think i did
154:29 - just to try a few things out and just
154:31 - just enjoy it really not necessarily
154:33 - immediately think i need to do this and
154:34 - become a developer as soon as possible i
154:36 - think it's good to take your time just
154:38 - to
154:39 - yeah try try some things out and but
154:41 - then as you
154:43 - enjoy it more hopefully and get a sense
154:44 - that it is what you want to do
154:46 - trying to um
154:49 - find ways to keep yourself motivated in
154:51 - my case it was initially doing these
154:52 - courses which had deadlines at the end
154:54 - of the week
154:55 - and then in the meetups thinking okay
154:57 - there's another meetup in two weeks i'd
154:59 - like to be able to show
155:01 - something to someone by then
155:03 - you know sometimes you feel like if you
155:04 - go along and you've not done anything
155:05 - since last time it's like oh you know i
155:07 - should have done it it's a nice kind of
155:09 - motivator having some peers around you
155:12 - i think it's very easy to sort of
155:14 - stay by yourself and
155:16 - get a bit isolated but you know what we
155:18 - try and encourage with the meetups is to
155:20 - get people to come along and just
155:22 - you know
155:23 - talk to people um see where everyone
155:27 - else is don't feel shy about it
155:29 - everyone's there to help each other
155:31 - we're not about
155:32 - you know criticizing i mean might be
155:34 - constructive criticism but um
155:37 - yeah
155:38 - so yeah yeah and so
155:41 - your leadership within uh within these
155:44 - meetups and and helping people in your
155:46 - town
155:47 - pick up these skills what are some
155:49 - observations you've had about people
155:50 - who've approached it and how do they
155:53 - generally find out about the events that
155:54 - come to them yeah so we uh so yeah for
155:57 - some more context i've been going to the
155:58 - meetups for about two and a half years
156:00 - but i've only been
156:01 - leading them since the beginning of this
156:03 - year um the person alex who was really
156:05 - great she was running them for a few
156:07 - years
156:08 - but just had a lot on her plate so she
156:11 - looked for a volunteer to to carry to
156:13 - carry on with them and as i was going to
156:15 - them all the time i thought i should do
156:16 - that
156:17 - [Music]
156:19 - ask for observations yeah i mean we get
156:21 - such a
156:22 - huge range of people that come there are
156:24 - people who have surprisingly you get
156:25 - quite a few people who turn up
156:28 - um and they they ask me you know i'd
156:30 - like to learn to co where do i start and
156:31 - okay if you try free code camera like oh
156:34 - there's an online platform they actually
156:35 - don't realize they've heard seen the
156:37 - meetups on
156:39 - meetup.com or i mean we have the
156:41 - facebook group obviously which i
156:42 - moderate and
156:44 - or just like the venues have their own
156:46 - websites and stuff so it's sometimes
156:48 - quite funny when to see the look on
156:49 - their face when to actually see someone
156:50 - for the first time see the curriculum
156:52 - and they're like this isn't all free is
156:54 - it and actually you know you explain yes
156:56 - it is and so that's great um yeah so we
156:59 - get we do get people who are really
157:00 - right at the beginning like that um and
157:02 - again this is
157:03 - what i keep telling i think there's we
157:05 - have
157:06 - i think we're getting on for like 6 000
157:07 - people on the groove but we get about 20
157:10 - to 30 people who actually come and i
157:12 - think there's a lot of people there and
157:14 - this is partly why i'm sitting here is
157:16 - too much i'm trying to make them realize
157:18 - don't be shy you know we'd love to have
157:20 - you um
157:22 - yeah so we do have that we got a lot of
157:24 - people who come
157:26 - who are yeah i mean we very rarely get
157:28 - people who are
157:29 - overly cocky actually most people are
157:31 - a bit unsure of themselves and it's nice
157:33 - to tell them actually no you're doing
157:34 - really well and
157:36 - yeah and we've had a lot of success
157:38 - stories lately i think the last meet up
157:41 - three or four people since the previous
157:43 - one had got jobs
157:44 - since that one so it's always nice when
157:46 - people come along and say hey yeah i've
157:47 - got a job since last time so
157:49 - that's really good to see
157:51 - yeah well that's amazing so
157:53 - having uh 20 or 30 people show up at a
157:56 - meet-up is is really good
157:58 - i talk to people all the time uh who
158:01 - have been working very hard to build up
158:02 - a
158:03 - kind of a critical mass of people coming
158:05 - and it takes a lot of work to to get a
158:08 - group to that size
158:09 - it's you know because it's hard work
158:11 - showing up in a meet-up and you have to
158:12 - put yourself out there you have to learn
158:14 - new things in programming pretty much
158:15 - everything you do you're doing it for
158:17 - the first time
158:18 - uh otherwise you just rerun the script
158:20 - you wrote last time right
158:21 - so
158:22 - uh i
158:24 - let's talk about
158:25 - music specifically
158:27 - and you said you were inspired by your
158:29 - friend who was a musician and how he
158:30 - transitioned into development
158:32 - and the parallels you see
158:35 - uh between
158:36 - music and coding
158:38 - yeah i think
158:40 - certainly self-discipline is a key one
158:42 - like as a kid just getting
158:45 - into the habit of practicing an hour a
158:47 - day of guitar on piano in my case and
158:49 - whatever instrument it may be that's
158:51 - definitely really been a key one is
158:52 - being able to
158:54 - um yeah just just motivate yourself try
158:56 - and
158:58 - sometimes it's a chore sometimes it's
158:59 - really not but but trying to doing a bit
159:02 - every day even if it is just maybe even
159:04 - 20 minutes is better than
159:06 - leaving long gaps and then doing a huge
159:07 - amount you know doing nothing for a
159:09 - month and then spending a weekend solid
159:12 - it's better to do yeah a bit every day
159:14 - or every other day so certainly that
159:17 - kind of thing um other parallels in
159:18 - music i guess
159:20 - patterns looking for patterns and things
159:22 - when i'm looking at chords and scales
159:24 - there's a lot of this kind of i'm i've
159:27 - come from a background i've been quite
159:28 - interested in music theory and that kind
159:29 - of picking things apart and seeing how
159:31 - they work so certainly from that that
159:33 - translates quite nicely into looking at
159:36 - code bases and trying to figure out
159:37 - what's behind the scenes and how that's
159:39 - happening so yeah
159:42 - well what are some of your near-term
159:43 - goals as far as
159:46 - your leadership of the the study group
159:48 - and also just your personal career goals
159:52 - uh as far as the study group um yeah
159:54 - trying to get them get the meetups more
159:57 - regularly we are increasing this now
159:58 - we're getting i've been talking to some
160:00 - more venues around london and so we're
160:02 - not usually we're just in the same place
160:05 - but we're now trying out some other
160:06 - things so that's helping to keep things
160:09 - keep a bit more momentum going getting
160:11 - more people going obviously it's always
160:12 - good and i try and encourage
160:14 - people on the facebook group and our
160:16 - group and people who come
160:18 - this doesn't have to be the only thing
160:19 - go to other meetups or start your own
160:22 - um
160:22 - we're not we don't own the freecode
160:25 - brand you know we're just volunteers and
160:27 - so we do get people who
160:29 - you know
160:30 - after a session go hey you want to meet
160:32 - up
160:32 - the weekend and do some coding and stuff
160:34 - so always constantly trying to encourage
160:36 - that
160:37 - um talking to a few people about maybe
160:40 - doing some some talks and workshops at
160:41 - the moment our meetups are quite loose
160:44 - so
160:44 - which is kind of deliberate because i
160:47 - want to keep them as unintimidating as
160:49 - possible so that and also for me
160:51 - personally when i've been coding all day
160:53 - to go and
160:54 - have like three hours of lectures as it
160:56 - were they can be really great but
160:57 - sometimes you just just want to talk and
161:00 - um and enjoy the social aspect so yeah
161:03 - but but i think maybe we could
161:05 - also be a bit more structured have
161:06 - occasional talks on that kind of thing
161:09 - as far as career i've just started a new
161:11 - job this week so um wow congratulations
161:13 - tell us about that so it's with um it's
161:16 - with a company called bulb who are
161:19 - a green energy company so do 100
161:22 - uh renewable electricity and 10
161:24 - renewable gas
161:26 - so it's quite a good mission which i'm
161:28 - you know quite passionate about
161:30 - um and they're growing at a phenomenal
161:32 - rate so i think they had about a hundred
161:34 - thousand customers at christmas and now
161:36 - it's on to eight hundred thousand so
161:38 - it's um they're
161:40 - hiring more developers they want to you
161:43 - know obviously keep on top of things it
161:44 - was an interesting first week because it
161:46 - was
161:47 - everybody whether you're senior
161:48 - management or
161:50 - entry level
161:51 - does the energy specialist training so
161:54 - um learning about the energy industry
161:56 - and how to deal with customer
161:57 - interactions we haven't even seen the
161:58 - code base yet but so we'll see what it
162:00 - looks like on monday which is going to
162:01 - be fun but it's a really good stack you
162:02 - know react redox and enzyme just node on
162:05 - the back end so lots of good stuff
162:07 - that's great they're working with a
162:08 - contemporary stack so you'll you'll be
162:09 - pretty at home because you've been
162:11 - working with that previously and that's
162:12 - what you learned yeah yeah
162:15 - my previous job was mostly react redux
162:17 - so
162:18 - um quite familiar with that but i've
162:20 - done bits of back end but not too much
162:22 - so it'd be good to have a chance to do
162:23 - that as well and we're doing and it's
162:25 - all in typescript as well which i'm
162:26 - liking more and more that kind of thing
162:28 - so
162:29 - yeah i'm excited about typescript too
162:31 - there's a there's a new version and node
162:33 - that's typescript based i don't know if
162:35 - you've heard about it it's called deno
162:36 - it's like node but up backward
162:38 - or i guess an anagram of node deno
162:42 - i have the subreddit if anybody's
162:44 - interested in posting about deno uh r
162:47 - deno
162:49 - i'm the
162:50 - administrator on that subreddit now so
162:54 - as you learn more about typescript
162:56 - especially i'd encourage you to teach
162:58 - the community about it because that is a
162:59 - topic that i think everybody should get
163:01 - some exposure to we're hoping to add
163:03 - typescript to the free cooking
163:04 - curriculum as well yeah brilliant i mean
163:06 - to be honest i'm
163:08 - pretty much a beginner in it myself i
163:10 - mean i did
163:11 - you know the twitch project i did that
163:12 - for the hell of it i did it in angular 2
163:15 - like two years ago and built that with
163:16 - types where i learned it for that i
163:18 - think it's changed a bit since then i've
163:19 - mainly been using flow in my previous
163:21 - job so but a lot of the principles are
163:24 - quite similar so but it'll be nice so
163:27 - having said that it is good to teach
163:29 - things even if you're not yet an expert
163:31 - because by teaching you do learn
163:32 - yourself so yeah maybe that's a good
163:34 - goal i should set myself is try and
163:37 - teach some people some typescript at the
163:39 - meetups
163:40 - all right matt well uh thanks again for
163:42 - your leadership of the free cocaine
163:43 - london uh group and i popped your
163:46 - information up on the on the screen
163:48 - uh i think are you on twitter oh it's
163:52 - not really not really okay there's a
163:53 - free code camp which we're doing which
163:55 - i'm actually probably
163:57 - not so great at maintaining as the other
163:59 - platforms but um
164:00 - yeah if anything i'm trying to maybe cut
164:03 - down social media just a little bit so
164:05 - but um but yeah i'm i'm on facebook and
164:07 - happy people linkedin obviously i'm
164:09 - happy for people to have me on that
164:11 - right well i would encourage you if
164:12 - you're visiting london which is one of
164:14 - the most popular tourist destinations in
164:16 - the world or if you happen to be in the
164:18 - area
164:19 - um if you happen to live in in the uk
164:22 - and just travel there occasionally
164:24 - i would encourage you to attend one of
164:26 - the free co camp london events i've
164:27 - heard great things about it you've got
164:29 - some amazing photos from your events
164:31 - that i've seen and and
164:33 - i've heard great things about the events
164:34 - from various people have gone yeah
164:36 - likewise if when you're in london please
164:37 - do join us
164:39 - all right well hopefully within the next
164:40 - year or two i'll make it out to one of
164:42 - your events i'd love to go it's a it's a
164:44 - beautiful city it's got so much history
164:46 - fantastic okay
164:47 - okay thanks again matt
164:52 - i'm great this is teemo
164:55 - hey teemo
164:58 - thanks timo uh can you tell me how to
165:01 - pronounce your last name

165:04 - gurenges
165:06 - goodanges teemo gullenges
165:08 - okay and you're from the netherlands
165:10 - yeah from veda from the south of the
165:12 - netherlands
165:14 - okay so from which city in the south
165:16 - netherlands
165:21 - okay
165:22 - so
165:23 - first of all i just want to
165:25 - make sure everybody knows teemo is a
165:27 - prolific contributor i think i was
165:29 - talking about you earlier when we were
165:30 - going around in the circle but you've
165:32 - contributed an incredible amount and if
165:34 - you look on the github repo and look
165:36 - rank everything by commits you're way up
165:38 - there
165:39 - along with ben mcmahon and some of the
165:40 - other people we've talked to tonight
165:42 - so timo
165:44 - you are a young developer who is
165:48 - rapidly
165:49 - learning new skills and contributing to
165:51 - open source talk about how you got
165:53 - interested in technology
165:56 - i've been thinking about that recently
165:58 - and the truth is i don't really know
166:00 - what got me into this just
166:02 - i found out about it i tried it and i
166:04 - liked it and i stuck with it because it
166:07 - seemed fun and
166:08 - yeah i i can't really tell why why i
166:11 - like it but i like it and i think i like
166:12 - solving the puzzle
166:14 - i specifically like helping other people
166:17 - with the things
166:18 - i can help them with but
166:20 - yeah
166:21 - why why programming i i don't know it's
166:24 - just it seemed fun and it turned out to
166:26 - be fun so i stuck with it
166:32 - what are some
166:33 - of the ways that you've contributed to
166:35 - the free cooking community over the past
166:37 - year and a half or so
166:39 - so when it started out
166:41 - almost exactly two years ago now um
166:45 - i started with making small changes
166:47 - mostly to the curriculum uh small fixes
166:50 - to the test mostly so it was a test that
166:52 - was missing correct uh solutions or it
166:56 - was allowing
166:57 - solutions that shouldn't be allowed
166:59 - i try to fix those and that's mostly
167:01 - what i started out doing and then uh i
167:03 - found out about the free guide being
167:05 - developed
167:06 - and actually you had quite a bit of time
167:08 - at the time that it uh
167:10 - was an act of development and uh i got
167:12 - involved and i spent a lot of time
167:15 - on uh contributing to the freakout
167:16 - combine to the platform not the articles
167:18 - the content but to the platform
167:21 - the site around it
167:24 - yeah and
167:25 - the guide specifically what are some of
167:27 - the articles that you wrote that you're
167:29 - particularly proud of
167:30 - i the only article or the only content
167:33 - on the guide that i wrote is the home
167:35 - page
167:36 - which i'm still i'm kind of proud of
167:37 - because i'm sure a lot of people have
167:39 - seen it and it's
167:40 - actually in the past year or so it
167:43 - hasn't changed at all so it's
167:45 - kind of fun but i haven't read any other
167:47 - in any other content for the guide it's
167:48 - the only content i've written so most of
167:50 - your contributions have been to
167:52 - uh the the application itself and yeah
167:55 - yeah exactly yeah i've done a lot to uh
167:58 - just for the looks of this fight for the
168:00 - performance i
168:01 - cut it in half at one point there was a
168:03 - weird issue that made the
168:05 - loading time twice as long as it
168:07 - could be
168:08 - so that's a fun thing i did and
168:10 - lots of stuff around that making the
168:12 - tests better making it making sure it
168:14 - would
168:15 - give better errors when the things
168:16 - failed and
168:17 - that's sort of what i did around the
168:18 - kite
168:19 - yeah so
168:21 - next month
168:22 - we're having the freco camp jam stack
168:24 - hackathon we're going to be building a
168:26 - lot of applications using tools like gas
168:28 - bjs which is what the guide is built on
168:32 - are you do you have any time or energy
168:34 - to participate in that hackathon i think
168:36 - i heard about it and then i checked my
168:39 - calendar i think i could not that was i
168:42 - don't remember but i think it was
168:43 - something that made it so that it was
168:45 - difficult for me to attend but
168:48 - yeah i'd like to and i'd definitely
168:50 - check again but it probably won't work
168:52 - yeah okay well we moved it back a week
168:53 - so now it's november third
168:55 - november third and fourth and even
168:58 - though we're having it in person in
169:00 - san francisco at github we're also going
169:02 - to have
169:04 - a much larger online hackathon and one
169:07 - of the things we're doing
169:09 - is we're building kind of like google's
169:11 - lighthouse score you know how you can
169:13 - you can add like a chrome extension we
169:15 - want to do is we want to build something
169:17 - like google's lighthouse
169:19 - score
169:19 - that checks whenever a page is like
169:22 - redeployed through nullify we create
169:24 - some sort of web hook and then we can go
169:26 - in and we can just run a bunch of tests
169:28 - against it and figure out you know
169:30 - performance
169:31 - how it's doing performance wise how it's
169:33 - doing seo wise accessibility wise
169:37 - and
169:38 - and other like basic security
169:40 - considerations things like that so
169:42 - if you're interested you're somebody who
169:44 - has
169:45 - a ton of experience working with stack
169:47 - and and
169:48 - me and stuart are going to be working on
169:50 - this basically all through the month of
169:52 - october during hacktoberfest
169:54 - putting this tool together to
169:58 - to basically test hackathon projects
170:00 - programmatically would that be something
170:02 - you might be interested in contributing
170:03 - to yeah i think it definitely sounds
170:05 - exactly like the kind of thing i'm
170:06 - looking to contribute to right now so
170:08 - that's really cool to hear about i've
170:09 - been
170:10 - away from the contributing to africa
170:12 - again for a while now and
170:14 - that sounds like right up my alley so
170:17 - yeah i i definitely i'm definitely going
170:19 - to look at what i can do to contribute
170:21 - to that yeah
170:22 - great well we'll plan to include you in
170:24 - some of the meetings that steward and i
170:25 - have um
170:27 - right now we're focused of course on
170:28 - getting the freco camp repo easier to
170:30 - contribute to
170:31 - in preparation for oktoberfest got like
170:34 - a week
170:34 - left but
170:37 - that
170:38 - i'll definitely loop you in because we
170:39 - would totally welcome your help with
170:42 - that you've got so much knowledge about
170:43 - performance and and security and things
170:45 - like that
170:47 - what are
170:49 - currently uh
170:51 - what are you doing
170:52 - uh as a developer and what's your what's
170:55 - the next year and a half or so of your
170:56 - life look like
170:58 - wow that's a different question
171:00 - so right now i work at a very small
171:02 - local software company where the only
171:03 - developers are
171:05 - me my boss
171:06 - and a
171:08 - freelance software developer
171:10 - but it's i'm having a lot of fun there
171:13 - the people there are great so
171:15 - that's fun but the tech is quite old but
171:18 - also because it's such a small company i
171:20 - get to do a lot of different things and
171:21 - i quite enjoy that so
171:24 - um
171:25 - i
171:26 - i'll be looking into progressive web
171:28 - apps and we'll probably be turning our
171:29 - application to progressive web apps i'm
171:31 - quite excited to do that and
171:33 - we have a lot of
171:36 - ui
171:37 - improvements and performance
171:39 - improvements so
171:41 - i really like those areas and
171:44 - also happen to be the areas that we are
171:46 - going to focus on in our application uh
171:48 - at my job so
171:49 - it works out great
171:52 - awesome well timo it's been so wonderful
171:55 - having you fly in
171:57 - from the netherlands hanging out with us
171:59 - what are some things you plan to do
172:01 - while you're here in dublin
172:03 - um i'm usually the kind of person that
172:06 - really plans out in advance what i
172:09 - potentially like to do but for this trip
172:11 - i didn't
172:12 - look at anything at all so i'm leaving
172:15 - monday so i've the old day tomorrow here
172:17 - so i'll probably be at the fun run
172:19 - and uh
172:20 - don't have any idea what i'm going to do
172:22 - tomorrow apart from that but hoping to
172:24 - see do some sightseeing in dublin
172:26 - tomorrow and that's about it really yeah
172:29 - well thank you so much for joining us
172:31 - timo it's great to meet you in person of
172:32 - course and we timo ran into us at the
172:35 - airport actually
172:36 - and we you just saw the free cookie i'm
172:38 - sure he's like hey
172:39 - and i was like oh tivo
172:41 - and uh so yeah it was pretty dramatic uh
172:44 - sudden
172:45 - meeting and uh you came back and hung
172:47 - out at the airbnb with us
172:49 - so
172:49 - yeah we're excited i'm looking forward
172:51 - to running around the park with you
172:52 - tomorrow yeah
172:54 - cheers
172:57 - yeah hey sam sam williams welcome yeah
173:01 - likewise have a seat thank you very much
173:03 - just very quickly we've got 36 minutes
173:06 - left in the venue so we're gonna try to
173:08 - get some more interviews
173:10 - yeah well thanks for all your articles
173:12 - so far sam they've been they've been
173:14 - great thank you and very well received
173:16 - by the community
173:18 - yeah thank you virtually like the first
173:19 - article i wrote i was
173:21 - i wrote it just because i was in china
173:23 - and
173:25 - i hated the great the great firewall of
173:27 - china and i sent it to you and said can
173:29 - you have a look and you said you loved
173:31 - it and actually
173:32 - made me an author on the uh on the free
173:35 - code camp media mask on the medium
173:37 - publication and
173:39 - that just gave me the boost i needed
173:41 - every other article before that i got
173:43 - like five ten maybe fifteen viewers
173:46 - getting on the free code camp thing
173:49 - boosted me and gave me the confidence to
173:50 - write more and that was really big for
173:52 - me
173:53 - right on well so you're somebody who's
173:56 - traveled extensively and
173:58 - seems like you're constantly learning
173:59 - new things and kind of pushing the
174:02 - bounds of your comfort zone you talk
174:03 - about how
174:04 - you came to be and like what what
174:07 - inspired you to to travel and to learn
174:10 - all these new technologies
174:12 - well
174:12 - i'm an obsessive rock climber and that's
174:14 - what got me into travelling and that's
174:16 - what actually got me into software
174:18 - development i worked as an aerospace
174:20 - engineer and
174:22 - i realized that it wasn't what i wanted
174:23 - to do so what i wanted to do was do more
174:26 - travelling and i realized that doing
174:28 - that doing
174:29 - engineering as a career wasn't going to
174:31 - get me there and
174:33 - software development would so i actually
174:35 - used free code camp to teach myself how
174:37 - to do that
174:38 - and after a couple of months of really
174:40 - hard work i managed to get my first
174:42 - software job
174:44 - after that i decided to save up all of
174:46 - my money and go traveling
174:48 - and
174:49 - then after that i was like okay i need
174:51 - to take it to the next level so i spent
174:54 - six months traveling and learning all
174:56 - the newest things i learned i taught
174:58 - myself react through
175:00 - yourselves free code camp and a couple
175:02 - of other resources
175:04 - um i pushed my node skills
175:07 - and i did everything i could and i wrote
175:09 - a lot of articles whilst i was traveling
175:11 - about
175:12 - what it was like to go from i know a bit
175:14 - of html and a bit of css to i want to
175:17 - become a really serious developer and
175:20 - that's a transition that
175:22 - i found quite tricky but
175:25 - hopefully um through those articles have
175:27 - helped some other people like
175:30 - find their pathway from
175:32 - very junior developer through to like a
175:35 - mid-level developer and
175:37 - it's cool because like some of the
175:38 - articles have had comments saying this
175:41 - has really helped this is like giving me
175:43 - a pathway and that's it's just such a
175:45 - good thing to see that other people
175:47 - are making that transition with us
175:51 - so
175:52 - i have to ask as a rock climber uh
175:54 - you know
175:56 - i've i enjoy climbing i enjoy bouldering
175:58 - i am not good at it at all
176:01 - but
176:02 - that is a very itinerant lifestyle
176:05 - you're traveling around from
176:07 - uh climbing location to climbing
176:10 - location probably a lot of national
176:12 - parks and places like that that you you
176:14 - visit you do outdoor climbing as well
176:16 - yeah
176:17 - yeah so i grew up doing indoor
176:19 - competition climbing which was good fun
176:22 - but i realized that when i started going
176:24 - outdoors that was the beauty and scenery
176:27 - outdoors and just climbing on real rock
176:29 - is
176:30 - so much better than climbing indoors
176:33 - so yeah i've been traveling around spain
176:36 - germany france europe i've been across
176:38 - to canada i've been to uh north africa
176:42 - and then this was five months of
176:44 - traveling around asia so like months in
176:47 - china
176:48 - thailand lao
176:50 - vietnam and
176:51 - it's just brilliant fun traveling and
176:54 - the great thing is with traveling and
176:56 - doing software development is that you
176:57 - can take your laptop with you
176:59 - which means you can do work whilst
177:01 - you're traveling i met
177:03 - five or six other developers whilst i
177:05 - was traveling who
177:07 - had their laptop with them and on their
177:09 - rest days would take the laptop out find
177:11 - a quiet corner and would do a day's work
177:14 - and that's how they sustained themselves
177:16 - on their
177:17 - perpetual travels which is a really
177:20 - i think long term is something i
177:21 - definitely intend to do
177:24 - so when i was
177:25 - i spent about five years in china myself
177:27 - uh when i was uh younger like right
177:30 - after college i moved there and i i
177:32 - taught and
177:34 - i was the school director and i did an
177:36 - intensive mandarin program and and uh
177:38 - did an mba
177:40 - but
177:40 - while i was there
177:42 - um
177:43 - i definitely
177:45 - enjoyed it and i
177:46 - thought about just living in different
177:48 - countries for the rest of my life
177:49 - ultimately i kind of settled in the
177:51 - states and i still go back to china like
177:53 - i'm getting ready to move there for like
177:55 - six months or so uh just just to live
177:57 - with the family and give my kids some
177:58 - more exposure to the language but
178:01 - there was this amazing book i read i
178:03 - wanted to see if you'd heard of it it
178:05 - was really inspiring to me at the time
178:06 - it's called vagabonding by ralph potts
178:10 - ralph potts i've never heard of that
178:12 - i've never heard of that book no
178:14 - i think it was kind of a precursor to
178:16 - the digital nomad movement and i'm not
178:18 - sure you know whether it holds up and
178:20 - whether the advice in there is still
178:21 - like best practices and stuff
178:24 - but it definitely opened my eyes to it
178:25 - and now there's this entire digital
178:27 - nomad movement
178:29 - do you identify as a digital nomad and
178:32 - are you parts of it a part of any of
178:34 - those communities
178:36 - uh currently i'm not a digital nomad i
178:38 - have a full-time job in manchester and i
178:40 - love it and it's brilliant but
178:43 - in the future i can definitely imagine
178:44 - myself well my aim in the future is to
178:47 - get to the point where
178:49 - i can comfortably sustain myself
178:52 - in a perpetual travel so i can go around
178:54 - i can live in a city i could live in
178:57 - like
178:57 - i could live in barcelona for a couple
178:59 - of months and then i could move to china
179:02 - and then i could move to chile and i
179:05 - that is the goal to have a digital nomad
179:07 - life where i can work
179:09 - where i want when i want
179:12 - and have complete autonomy of my life
179:16 - outside of
179:17 - like the the constrictions of
179:20 - a traditional job system
179:27 - in manchester
179:29 - uh do you are you able to work remotely
179:31 - at all or do you generally just work in
179:33 - an office
179:35 - currently i work in an office when i
179:36 - started this job i started as what i
179:40 - thought was
179:41 - a low to medium level developer
179:44 - i very quickly got pushed into being a
179:47 - mid to senior level developer like
179:50 - making quite big
179:52 - architectural decisions which
179:55 - turns out i really enjoyed
179:56 - so
179:58 - we've got a really small team and we
180:00 - tend to work all in the office
180:02 - if i want to work at home for a day if i
180:04 - need to i can that's fine but
180:07 - at the moment with the size of the
180:08 - company i work at working at an office
180:11 - especially because it's a 10 minute
180:12 - commute
180:13 - it's not two hours of driving i find
180:16 - it's quite nice to get away from home
180:19 - because that means that when you finish
180:21 - you go home
180:23 - and you can shut off yes occasionally
180:25 - you do have to pop occasionally you do
180:27 - have to pop online because there's a bug
180:29 - on the live system
180:31 - but you can go back but most of the time
180:34 - it's you finish work at the end of the
180:35 - day you go home
180:37 - and being able to fully disconnect being
180:41 - is something i'm actually surprisingly
180:43 - enjoying
180:45 - compared to when i've done a little bit
180:46 - of remote work before
180:50 - well
180:51 - you came from i think you said aerospace
180:54 - engineering
180:55 - so that's a field that's another
180:57 - engineering field uh you know software
180:59 - engineering software development
181:02 - also applies a lot of similar you know
181:04 - math and and
181:06 - kind of engineering principles
181:09 - how much of your aerospace space
181:11 - engineering training has been helpful in
181:14 - moving into software development
181:18 - i think
181:19 - actually quite a lot of it a lot of the
181:21 - problem solving and the
181:24 - ways that you approach
181:26 - technical problems
181:28 - through that we were taught and we
181:29 - practiced through university were
181:31 - actually really like applicable to
181:34 - software development unfortunately
181:36 - they're not actually that applicable to
181:38 - real world
181:39 - engineer like aerospace engineering
181:42 - which is ironic
181:44 - so i think a lot of the skills the
181:46 - problem solving and the approaches and
181:50 - like how to deal with something when you
181:51 - hit that wall that's the kind of thing
181:53 - that you deal with quite a lot at
181:55 - university when you hit a project and
181:57 - you hit that wall how to break through
181:59 - that wall whether it's taking some time
182:02 - off or approaching it from completely
182:04 - different direction
182:05 - yeah like aerospace engineering taught
182:08 - me more about software development than
182:10 - it did about aerospace engineering
182:12 - what would be some advice uh that you
182:14 - would have for other people who have
182:16 - gone into a field of engineering whether
182:18 - it's mechanical engineering
182:20 - or aerospace engineering or petroleum
182:22 - engineering or a field where
182:24 - perhaps growing a lot less quickly than
182:27 - software development is which i think is
182:29 - probably the fastest growing field maybe
182:32 - on earth um what would be your advice to
182:35 - those people who already have kind of a
182:37 - traditional engineering training but are
182:39 - interested in pivoting into software
182:41 - development
182:43 - if you're interested in pivoting into
182:44 - software
182:46 - at all give it a try
182:48 - stuff like free code camp and there's
182:50 - hundreds of other free resources out
182:52 - there they're all absolutely brilliant i
182:55 - learned
182:56 - most of the stuff i know now through
182:58 - free code camp it's free it has
183:01 - step-by-step tutorials that give you
183:02 - really good feedback as you're
183:05 - progressing through
183:06 - and
183:07 - the worst that happens is you try it out
183:09 - you do two or three months
183:11 - and you find that you don't enjoy it

183:16 - learned some new skills but you don't
183:17 - progress
183:18 - if you do enjoy it and you end up moving
183:21 - into software you can end up
183:24 - as a remote developer you could end up
183:26 - traveling around the world you could end
183:27 - up working with chat bots like i
183:29 - currently do and working with some of
183:31 - like the coolest tech like working with
183:33 - ai

183:36 - and doing something that is so beyond
183:40 - what you're constricted to within the
183:42 - traditional engineering roles
183:45 - thanks so much for coming out uh from

184:35 - richard i'm so thrilled we've talked so
184:37 - many times we've been in touch
184:40 - richard is in charge of pre-co camp
184:43 - leads
184:44 - pre-code cam oslo and the free cocaine
184:47 - instagram which has
184:49 - i don't know 10 000 ish
184:51 - like 13 and a half or something now
184:53 - somebody wrote in the 13s i think yeah
184:55 - yeah and it's
184:56 - it's great photos of freco camp events
185:00 - and just beautiful workstations and code
185:03 - setups and things like that yeah all
185:05 - that stuff all the good stuff
185:07 - yeah what are your goals so you really
185:09 - took charge on the instagram and
185:12 - i mean you owned it
185:14 - for
185:15 - you were already very prolific on
185:17 - instagram you had a lot of your own
185:18 - photos you had a ton of followers
185:20 - yourself
185:21 - and you really took the free cocaine
185:23 - instagram which was largely just
185:25 - chilling there because
185:26 - i think i was the only person who had
185:28 - access to it at the time and and
185:30 - and now it's it's quite vibrant and
185:32 - there's a lot of beautiful photos on
185:34 - there
185:35 - can you describe that process of
185:37 - thinking like hey maybe i could help out
185:38 - with this and and how you went about it
185:42 - yes so i think
185:44 - people took it from about three thousand
185:45 - at the time uh are you saying it was
185:47 - like underutilized i think the thing i
185:49 - think you were
185:50 - very um
185:53 - very very good on twitter and things
185:55 - like that that stuff was doing it um and
185:58 - what i was doing on my own instagram
186:01 - uh was just pictures of my code stuff
186:04 - i'm working on
186:06 - um
186:07 - and things like that so
186:10 - we had the conversation about doing some
186:11 - stuff with the free code can't component
186:13 - to it have a lot more of the community
186:15 - stuff in there as well uh trying to re
186:19 - re-upload other people's pictures um
186:22 - re-gram them or whatever they call that
186:24 - um so that's kind of what we tried to do
186:26 - get the community thing more in there uh
186:29 - and just try and
186:31 - try and build that up and have it a bit
186:32 - more of a community a bit more so other
186:34 - people could um
186:35 - you know get involved in that as well so
186:37 - that was the plan yeah
186:39 - yeah and uh early on you you made it a
186:41 - clear point that people could basically
186:43 - add mention free code camper hashtag
186:45 - freak codecamp on instagram and we could
186:47 - basically signal boost
186:49 - their photos and and of course credit
186:51 - them and everything uh
186:53 - are people still doing that pretty
186:54 - regularly we need them to do it more
186:57 - do it more
186:58 - um especially to do with
187:01 - if there's meetups going on
187:03 - that stuff's great so if we've got a
187:04 - meet up and you've got a picture of all
187:05 - the groups and stuff like that
187:08 - we love that stuff so like send those
187:09 - stuff but um
187:11 - yeah
187:12 - i'm constantly going in there checking
187:13 - the hashtags or if you've been tagging
187:15 - us in them directly as well trying to
187:17 - find the good stuff out there and
187:18 - posting it on there so um
187:20 - if if people send me the good stuff then
187:23 - it means i don't have to do anything so
187:25 - that's kind of what we want to do for
187:26 - sure
187:27 - yeah so beyond the instagram
187:31 - you have been leading these two study
187:33 - groups in two very different cities
187:35 - you're originally from leeds but you
187:36 - live in oslo as well
187:38 - yeah so um
187:40 - my kind of journey with the whole code
187:42 - thing started
187:44 - i was living
187:45 - in oslo so i kind of got back round to
187:48 - it uh coding i'd done a little bit when
187:50 - i was very young it was html with inline
187:52 - css so we're talking like 1997 here um
187:56 - so i got back around to it i was
187:58 - actually living in oslo at the time um
188:02 - then
188:03 - i ended up taking over the admin of the
188:05 - oslo group because
188:09 - the person who was running it wasn't
188:10 - really running it so they had a backlog
188:12 - of people they wanted to get into the
188:13 - group
188:15 - but they weren't being accepted so i
188:17 - managed to get hold of the the admin at
188:19 - a time and and
188:21 - get her to add me then i took over the
188:23 - admin of that
188:25 - um then as i was going back to uh leeds
188:29 - so i kind of been in oslo twice
188:30 - basically
188:31 - going back to leeds we had marek who
188:33 - came to the new york
188:35 - show
188:36 - and
188:37 - he was really like i want to do it
188:40 - and it's going to give me a kick up the
188:41 - ass if if if i have this commitment that
188:44 - i'm the person here
188:46 - okay well i'm i'm back in lead so i went
188:49 - over to leeds
188:50 - um got involved in the leeds community i
188:53 - think at that time they just added some
188:54 - more admins to kind of
188:56 - get stuff moving a little bit um because
188:59 - then also when i was there we started
189:00 - doing the coffee and code meet-ups
189:03 - you know we started weekly and doing
189:05 - once a month and
189:06 - trying to find its feet which was great
189:08 - when mike took over that he made it once
189:10 - a week and that momentum was really good
189:13 - so back in leeds
189:15 - we had the first copying code meetup
189:17 - i think after i've been there a month
189:20 - uh then they had me as the admin there
189:22 - so we started trying to do more frequent
189:23 - copy and code stuff there so we're doing
189:25 - it monthly day as well
189:27 - and obviously we've got johnny bissell
189:29 - the famous the legend of johnny bissell
189:32 - the legend uh so
189:34 - if you want to just um
189:37 - message johnny bizzle on twitter and
189:38 - just say ninja i think it's at johnny
189:40 - bizzle i'm sure it is just say you're a
189:42 - legend you know i go there well
189:44 - um and we've got charlie as well a few
189:47 - of the guys
189:48 - who are helping in lead so we've got the
189:50 - coffin codes running there and i think
189:53 - i think that's the good thing about the
189:55 - facebook groups is
189:57 - you can look at all the different cities
189:58 - around the world and there's some groups
190:00 - that are
190:01 - slow and some groups are really going
190:03 - somewhere and it doesn't it doesn't
190:06 - start
190:07 - it doesn't start in the groups it starts
190:09 - outside the groups and when you can
190:10 - start making that community outside the
190:12 - group
190:13 - then it translates to stuff happening in
190:15 - the group so
190:16 - um
190:17 - i said i went back to leeds and we
190:19 - started doing stuff in leeds and i moved
190:20 - back to oslo again
190:22 - and mike did a great job of making the
190:24 - copy and code meetups every week
190:27 - and from then you know i've been
190:30 - i've been back in oslo maybe
190:32 - six months now i think something like
190:33 - that
190:34 - and
190:35 - we're getting between
190:38 - seven and 13 people every single
190:41 - monday night
190:42 - um
190:44 - oslo isn't a big city it's like um 800
190:47 - 000 people so we've got 400 people in
190:49 - the group i think something like that
190:51 - so to have that community of uh people
190:54 - who come in every single every single
190:56 - week is great because
190:57 - it's the motivation to keep going you
191:00 - know
191:01 - even if all we do is just talk rubbish
191:03 - all night and we don't code anything
191:05 - which happens like but
191:06 - for me it happens the majority of times
191:09 - it's made for monday night it's my
191:11 - favorite night of the week i get to go
191:13 - hang out with these guys and we chill
191:15 - you know we'll go down to the lake we'll
191:17 - have some beers by the lake
191:18 - we'll go out and have a party like it's
191:21 - gone beyond
191:23 - we're here to learn to code it's like
191:26 - there's good friendships and i think
191:27 - with
191:28 - um
191:29 - what we're doing also especially there's
191:31 - a very big immigrant population there
191:33 - like
191:34 - as in some immigrant expat community
191:37 - um
191:39 - so it's nice to have something that ties
191:41 - us together and brings people together
191:43 - that
191:44 - uh as a social thing as well you know
191:46 - we've got people from
191:47 - uh not just people from england norway
191:50 - america um
191:52 - you know poland
191:54 - czech republic we've got lots of people
191:56 - that
191:56 - automatically have this connection with
191:58 - you because you code but also
192:00 - it brings together it gives you a good
192:02 - bond which is really cool it's like
192:04 - it's bigger than the sum of its parts i
192:05 - guess you could say yeah for sure
192:08 - yeah so you you just to summarize some
192:11 - of the insights you've shared
192:13 - first of all trying to build a community
192:15 - with like friends
192:17 - in a city first and get coffee and codes
192:19 - going and then try to invite the local
192:22 - facebook group into that rather than
192:24 - trying to post on the facebook group hey
192:26 - i'm trying to have this event if you get
192:28 - a critical mass going first where you
192:31 - have people meeting it makes it easier
192:32 - to bring more people from the community
192:34 - is that kind of what you're saying
192:36 - no i'd say the way we worked it was this
192:39 - i'm gonna go study every monday
192:42 - i don't care if you come
192:43 - i'm going like this is my thing and for
192:47 - me that's a
192:48 - it's one of those things where
192:51 - i had to do it and i motivated myself to
192:54 - go do it
192:55 - and when that when that momentum keeps
192:56 - going you might have one person one week
192:59 - might have no persons the week after but
193:02 - it's it's you're not doing it because of
193:05 - how many people are coming you're doing
193:06 - it because that's what you have to do
193:08 - and i think when you have these groups
193:10 - where people have got
193:12 - good leaders then they're just going to
193:14 - go do it because
193:16 - that's what they're going to do
193:17 - and it happens like
193:20 - even in
193:21 - the facebook groups if you're not
193:23 - um
193:24 - if you're not posting as a leader
193:28 - as a leader if you're not posting and
193:30 - you've got to be the one who's doing it
193:31 - even if nobody else is replying
193:34 - it's almost one of those things like
193:36 - you're so selfishly um
193:40 - blinkered if you like
193:44 - you almost explain you don't even care
193:46 - what's going on you're you've got to do
193:47 - it
193:48 - people might not be replying just keep
193:50 - posting keep posting the article you bet
193:52 - it's like and eventually the momentum
193:54 - will come you know
193:55 - leeds is very similar to oslo with the
193:57 - amount of people it's like 700 000 right
193:59 - so if
194:01 - if those groups can do it and you're in
194:03 - a city of 10 million people it's like
194:06 - you've got you've got such a base than
194:09 - even we had and the only thing that is
194:11 - different is the fact that we went
194:14 - i'm gonna do it and just
194:16 - just do it and don't care if you get any
194:18 - response so yeah just go do it for
194:20 - yourself
194:22 - keep posting make sure i make the event
194:24 - for the coffee and code meetup whatever
194:26 - it is and
194:27 - it's like the what is it field of dreams
194:29 - what's the movie where it's like build
194:30 - it and they'll come
194:32 - exactly that build and they'll come and
194:34 - i have to say uh just a quick
194:36 - observation because we're running out of
194:38 - time we're going to do a big group photo
194:40 - but i have to say that
194:44 - the study groups like where a study
194:46 - group will become huge and vibrant and
194:48 - help tons of people get a job has very
194:50 - little to correlation with the size of
194:53 - the metropolitan area has everything to
194:56 - do with the leadership of that study
194:58 - group and how passionate they are
195:00 - and how willing they are to do exactly
195:03 - what you said like i don't care if you
195:04 - come i'm going to be there so come and
195:07 - code with me if you want but either way
195:10 - i'm going to be there you know
195:12 - rain or shine and that attitude makes
195:14 - all the difference so thanks so much for
195:16 - imparting that in both the oslo and and
195:19 - in the leads groups and i'm hopeful that
195:22 - we can take a lot of your wisdom and you
195:24 - can write some articles and we can use
195:25 - that to help more people create these
195:28 - successful groups thanks so much for
195:29 - everything you're doing richard
195:33 - all right
196:09 - okay we're here with andrei do you have
196:11 - his name up on the screen
196:13 - okay perfect anderla has contributed
196:16 - extensively to free code camp uh through
196:19 - the free co camp guide and also
196:21 - publishing articles on medium tell us a
196:23 - little bit about yourself and how you
196:25 - discovered free code camp and decided to
196:27 - contribute to it
196:28 - okay um at the moment i'm a student
196:31 - actually just started like last week
196:33 - university um the
196:35 - my journey with frequent camp started
196:37 - when i um moved from like g-sharp to
196:40 - javascript because i needed to learn
196:42 - node.js for like a server application
196:46 - and uh i basically discovered frequent
196:48 - camp to learn javascript then
196:51 - i started like reading the articles on
196:53 - the medium publication
196:55 - and when i decided that i wanted to also
196:59 - write articles it just felt natural to
197:02 - go
197:03 - to publish the articles on the media
197:05 - publication
197:06 - and then from there like the involvement
197:09 - with the community just like grew uh
197:12 - gradually um leading to contribute also
197:15 - mainly to the guides repository but also
197:18 - like to the other repositories like
197:21 - smaller contributions
197:23 - awesome well thank you for your many
197:25 - contributions so far what are some areas
197:28 - like when you look at the free code camp
197:29 - community andra what are some areas
197:32 - where you
197:33 - see potential for improvement that
197:36 - you're interested in diving into
197:38 - oh oh okay um i think that the backhand
197:43 - curricula um is like very good on the um
197:48 - beginner level but there are like so
197:50 - many topics that could be covered of
197:52 - course like the uh the work on actually
197:55 - developing the courses is like enormous
197:58 - for example a technology that i'm very
198:00 - interested in is graphql
198:03 - i think that would be a very nice
198:05 - addiction
198:06 - you are also using that internally uh in
198:09 - for the
198:11 - um in the guides repository
198:13 - with gatsby so um
198:15 - very cool technology would like like to
198:18 - see that uh
198:20 - yeah well i will tell you under the if
198:23 - you're interested
198:24 - in helping contribute to that that's
198:26 - like we want to add typescript when we
198:28 - want to add graphql those are the two
198:29 - things that we're most excited about
198:31 - adding to the curriculum of course we
198:32 - have other
198:33 - like things kind of supplementary things
198:36 - but we want both graphql and
198:38 - and typescript to be covered in the core
198:40 - curriculum
198:41 - so yes we would welcome your help and
198:43 - and you're right there absolutely we
198:46 - basically scratch the surface on testing
198:48 - on security on a lot of these major npm
198:53 - modules that people can add that add so
198:55 - much functionality and we'd love to
198:56 - cover a lot more would you be interested
198:58 - in helping with that
198:59 - yeah okay actually there is a i have a
199:02 - graphql article in writing should be
199:05 - published like already a couple weeks um
199:09 - as um helping the curricula i i can do
199:13 - some work the whole like not too much
199:16 - involvement because of like the uh
199:18 - plenty of uh
199:21 - things i have to do in this
199:23 - like
199:24 - period starting university having like a
199:26 - startup in the launching
199:28 - side job
199:29 - really
199:30 - heavy on the schedule

199:35 - think you said you just started school
199:38 - you just started you just started
199:39 - university yeah congratulations yeah how
199:42 - old are you 18.
199:44 - oh wow
199:45 - you're getting really into
199:46 - uh really deep into technology pretty
199:48 - young and that's that's excellent
199:51 - yeah i actually like started my first
199:55 - experiences with coding like at 12
199:59 - the story goes basically oh i like games
200:02 - why not make one and then like i just
200:05 - started with
200:06 - the software that lets
200:08 - you just create the game with drag and
200:10 - drop stuff
200:12 - and then you say oh i want to add this
200:15 - like cool feature i will learn some
200:17 - scripting and then oh program is super
200:20 - cool i will learn this
200:21 - yeah have you uh so are you thinking
200:24 - like game maker or tools like that
200:27 - uh what what did you use early on for
200:28 - building games okay yeah early on i used
200:31 - game maker we actually had an issue
200:33 - because we are three people using game
200:35 - maker
200:36 - but we picked two
200:38 - different versions of a game maker
200:40 - and we didn't know that and so like um
200:43 - at the time uh of course we didn't use
200:45 - gate i didn't even know that git existed
200:48 - and so like sending the versions and
200:50 - loading them into the software
200:53 - like broke the code and we are like
200:56 - these two weeks in which we were like
200:58 - building this very
200:59 - uh basic ai and every time we uh like
201:02 - sent each other the code
201:04 - it broke
201:06 - until we realized oh
201:07 - you're using 8.1 i'm using 8.0
201:12 - wow that's that's kind of uh doesn't
201:14 - sound like they have very good backward
201:16 - compatibility
201:17 - yeah have you looked at uh
201:19 - unity 3d or the unreal engine or any of
201:22 - the more contemporary
201:24 - big developer tools for game development
201:27 - i did something unity but
201:30 - actually in the last three years i
201:32 - haven't done like anything in game
201:35 - development i've been doing mostly
201:38 - back-end
201:39 - work like on an iot framework
201:42 - some front-end work with react for the
201:45 - interface
201:47 - well but you know iot related stuff is
201:50 - of course very
201:51 - interesting and node.js is a powerful
201:53 - tool for doing iot stuff so if if you
201:56 - want to write more about that we'd
201:57 - welcome that if you do want to dive in
202:00 - and do more game development there we've
202:02 - published a lot of videos on game
202:03 - development like build flappy bird uh
202:06 - build you know basic
202:08 - kind of almost programming one-on-one
202:09 - type classes like tic-tac-toe and stuff
202:12 - but we would welcome more in-depth game
202:15 - development
202:16 - especially because it sounds like
202:17 - something that you you're passionate
202:19 - about they got you into coding in the
202:20 - first place
202:22 - yeah i definitely want to get back to
202:24 - game development in the future but not
202:27 - in the short future like
202:30 - when for example the iot framework that
202:32 - i'm building at the moment
202:34 - is like
202:35 - version one ready then we can start to
202:37 - think about okay let's begin another big
202:40 - project
202:41 - until then
202:42 - game development takes really a lot of
202:45 - time so
202:46 - it's on a stop for for now well it's
202:49 - it's great to hear about uh your
202:50 - projects and i'm glad you are staying
