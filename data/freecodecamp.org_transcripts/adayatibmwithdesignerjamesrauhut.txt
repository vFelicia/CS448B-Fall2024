00:00 - hi I'm James Rao I'm a designer at IBM
00:03 - design here in Austin Texas and I'm
00:05 - going to be doing A Day in the Life for
00:08 - free code Camp um it's 8:30 I need to
00:12 - head out so I can stop by the gym before
00:16 - work and sorry about the mess I just got
00:19 - married to awesome person all right
00:22 - let's go and when I say go to the gym I
00:25 - mean go to Chick-fil-A for the
00:27 - breakfast so I'm walking into the office
00:29 - now now uh it's a giant campus actually
00:33 - IBM's not the only person
00:35 - here but what's really funny is IBM
00:38 - originally built this campus uh either
00:41 - in the 60s or 70s and it's right north
00:45 - of it was on the outskirts of Austin
00:48 - when they built it and there really
00:50 - wasn't anything else here and since then
00:54 - now it's the now the largest outdoor
00:57 - mall and office space is right across
00:59 - the street so all of a sudden it's the
01:01 - place to be in
01:03 - Austin uh usually the family people that
01:06 - work here live uh in a suburb north of
01:09 - here and then the people that want to be
01:12 - where it's at live downtown and this is
01:15 - right in the middle which is nice I'm
01:18 - all about the commute so I live like 5
01:21 - minutes down the road from here uh but
01:23 - it's a pretty nice campus uh we got
01:26 - basketball court sand volleyball which I
01:30 - don't really
01:31 - use uh but my favorite part is that
01:34 - there's just so many restaurants in that
01:36 - outdoor mall right across the street to
01:38 - take advantage of for
01:41 - lunch so it's 9:00 a.m. I get into the
01:44 - office eating my
01:46 - Chick-fil-A but really the first task at
01:49 - hand is checking the email and the slack
01:52 - you think I'd have a lot of emails but
01:54 - rarely anymore cuz all of IBM is on
01:58 - slack now crazy promotion I know right
02:02 - so I just have a million slack channels
02:04 - and messages to
02:06 - check we're celebrating our manager
02:09 - recently becoming a design
02:11 - principal one of our teammates decorated
02:14 - her desk celebrating projects she's
02:17 - worked on and now we're all signing
02:18 - little notes for
02:24 - her okay so I've looked through all my
02:27 - emails not many looked through all my
02:29 - slacks
02:30 - lots and now I'm looking through GitHub
02:33 - Enterprise and public GitHub for
02:36 - whatever issues PRS that I need to look
02:40 - at um the GitHub Enterprise I look
02:45 - for mostly PRS for different projects on
02:49 - my wider team that I need to review and
02:52 - then on public GitHub I look through
02:55 - because one of the house chores in my
02:58 - job is uh maintaining a lot of public
03:01 - repos that really are mostly just assets
03:05 - for the IBM design language so that
03:08 - includes things like icons and colors
03:11 - charting Library we've been trying to
03:12 - get off the ground
03:14 - publicly uh
03:16 - and it's kind of a half developer half
03:19 - designer job because we have these build
03:22 - processes that we develop to
03:24 - automatically generate the assets for
03:27 - every change and then on the design side
03:29 - we have to actually make sure they
03:31 - they're usable for when designers are
03:34 - designing designs you know so that takes
03:39 - about like a half hour usually as long
03:41 - as there's not something crazy to look
03:43 - at so right now I'm backseat coating
03:46 - with Trevor uh one of my teammates on a
03:49 - different project we're just trying to
03:51 - make sure his devops go smoothly for
03:53 - this project he's
03:56 - starting so now I'm going to do an
03:59 - exercise for about a half hour of just
04:02 - exploring um content skeletons for when
04:06 - new data and experiences loading in and
04:09 - and see if any best patterns uh come out
04:12 - of this exercise I'm just going to try
04:13 - to keep going as wide as possible it was
04:17 - something I started
04:19 - yesterday so another Project's running
04:21 - into Blu miix
04:23 - problems but the nice thing about being
04:25 - in the studio in Austin is instead of
04:28 - dealing with tech support for it uh
04:31 - we're just going to go down to the Blu
04:32 - miix floor and start asking friends that
04:34 - work for Blu miix and they'll probably
04:37 - solve it in one minute and of course
04:40 - they figured it out in one minute it was
04:42 - no problem um I want to just share with
04:46 - you the entrance to my floor we have two
04:49 - special guests that are always at the
04:50 - entrance we have two of the robots from
04:53 - the Watson commercial that premiered at
04:56 - the last Super Bowl uh with gri fiser
05:00 - uh and they've been here for like over a
05:04 - year now I guess they're permanent guest
05:06 - at the
05:07 - studio so I got a good amount of time
05:10 - left uh before lunch so I'm going to add
05:15 - a uh some search functionality that some
05:18 - uh that a teammate wanted for one of
05:21 - their experiences uh just so they could
05:23 - search between the different users to
05:24 - find
05:27 - them get to eat lunch across the street
05:29 - Velvet Taco with the
05:32 - buds getting back from lunch saying hi
05:34 - to the robots hi robot hi robot that
05:37 - robot's confused all right so I'm back
05:40 - from lunch uh I've got a little bit of
05:42 - time before my first meeting of the
05:43 - afternoon so I just want to give you a
05:45 - tour of the Austin Studio real quick uh
05:49 - as fast as I
05:52 - can so a lot of the this is the seventh
05:55 - floor I work on the eighth floor but the
05:58 - seventh floor is actually full of these
05:59 - Open Spaces where we do a lot of
06:03 - workshops um these workshops are
06:05 - typically client workshops or IBM teams
06:09 - coming to Austin to do a workshop but we
06:12 - also do them for uh where if you're an
06:16 - entrylevel designer hired for IBM it
06:18 - doesn't matter which studio around the
06:20 - world you're being deployed to you
06:22 - always come here for a 3-month design
06:24 - boot camp and so one of those Open
06:26 - Spaces is your home for 3 months where
06:28 - you do a bunch of crazy
06:30 - projects uh we also have this uh media
06:34 - Studio where we're cranking out a lot of
06:37 - digital media for
06:43 - people this is all the colleges
06:45 - represented uh here at the Austin Studio
06:49 - doesn't mean you have to go to to a
06:51 - college but we're very well
06:58 - represented this is our make laab uh we
07:01 - do a lot of screen printing here uh you
07:04 - can and also all sorts of
07:07 - projects you can see some of the
07:09 - examples of the great screen prints that
07:10 - happen here uh back there we got a
07:17 - MakerBot and then this is the eighth
07:20 - floor where I work uh it's a lot more uh
07:23 - actual just product design teams so
07:26 - you'll see a lot more desk down here
07:30 - we've got uh the Power Systems team
07:33 - proud of their Hardware as well as their
07:35 - digital
07:41 - designs this is one of my favorite
07:43 - Corners because we represent Austin with
07:45 - a ACL Music
07:47 - Festival uh with all the posters of
07:50 - every year and then we've got a video
07:52 - game cabinet
08:00 - and then this
08:02 - Feast is H one of those crazy Microsoft
08:06 - hubs I love
08:08 - it we just uh leave a great piece right
08:12 - here for everyone to
08:18 - see and we'll just let whoever the next
08:20 - person is discover
08:22 - that and then this is my little Turf
08:26 - area uh I like to AstroTurf my apartment
08:29 - apartment balconies so I use all the
08:33 - leftover Turf just at my
08:35 - desk uh so I'm back at my computer uh
08:39 - first thing I want to do is we at IBM we
08:42 - have this big uh educational program for
08:45 - front-end developers called petucation
08:48 - where uh we get to present to each other
08:50 - uh new topics across the whole company
08:53 - uh live so right now I want to uh create
08:58 - a proposal for a new one about why CSS
09:00 - and JS is here to stay and uh it's not
09:05 - just a fad it's really exciting work
09:07 - especially uh coming off of a high since
09:10 - styled components version 2.0 just came
09:12 - out and I love it and of course all the
09:16 - submissions for a frontend development
09:18 - education program have to be on a GitHub
09:21 - repo so every submission idea is an
09:24 - issue
09:28 - itself oh
09:33 - so I just finished coding at 400 p.m.
09:36 - today and going to finish the day off by
09:40 - hanging out with my buddy Evan and
09:42 - explaining more about the skeletons we
09:43 - need to
09:45 - design it's getting near the end of the
09:47 - day one last thing I really need to do
09:49 - is clean my desk uh at IBM design we use
09:53 - a lot of sticky notes and my desk is
09:57 - covered in notes from this past
10:00 - week so it's 5:00 on Memorial Day Friday
10:05 - uh for the non-americans watching that
10:08 - means we have Monday off so everyone
10:10 - naturally wants to take uh Friday before
10:13 - for vacation time so that means there's
10:17 - nobody here but that's okay because we
10:22 - get to go now so we're headed out going
10:25 - home going to be
10:27 - safe and and do lots and lots of work
10:30 - over weekend not
10:32 - really one last thing I want to share my
10:35 - favorite sign in this whole studio we
10:37 - have an emergency exit door and if you
10:40 - push it alarm goes off so we never like
10:43 - when people push it but this was how we
10:46 - improved stopping people from pushing it
