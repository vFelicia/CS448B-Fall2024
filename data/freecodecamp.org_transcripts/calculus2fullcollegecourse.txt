00:06 - Hi, I'm Beau with Free Code Camp. This course
is taught by Dr. Linda green. She teaches
00:07 - at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, and she has been teaching calculus two
00:11 - for many years to undergraduate students,
we recommend using a paper and pencil so you
00:15 - can follow along at home. Let's start.
00:19 - This video introduces the idea of finding
the area between two curves. Let's start with
00:27 - some review. in calculus one, you approximate
the area between a curve and the x axis by
00:35 - dividing it up into tall skinny rectangles.
You represented the width of one of these
00:41 - rectangles using the symbols delta x, here
delta x means a small distance along the x
00:50 - axis or a small change in x values. You picked
out an x value called a sample point from
00:58 - each of these little sub intervals along the
x axis, one sample point for each rectangle.
01:05 - The sample point on the x axis for rectangle
number i is denoted by x i star. You use the
01:15 - sample points and the function f to figure
out the height of each rectangle. The height
01:22 - of rectangle number i is given by the functions
value on the sample point f of x star. From
01:33 - this, you calculate the area of each rectangle,
the area of a rectangle is base times height.
01:40 - So the area of the first rectangle is delta
x times f of x one star, the area of the second
01:48 - rectangle is delta x times f of x two star.
And the area of rectangle number i is going
01:56 - to be its base delta x times its height, f
of x i star, and so on, if there are n rectangles,
02:05 - than the last rectangle will have base delta
x and height f of x and star. So the approximate
02:16 - area under the curve is given by adding up
all these areas of all these rectangles. In
02:22 - sigma notation, this can be written as sigma,
the psalm from i equals one to n, the number
02:31 - of rectangles of the area of the rectangle,
delta x times f of x i star. The exact area
02:42 - is then given by the limit of these approximating
areas, as the number of rectangles goes to
02:48 - infinity. That's the limit as n goes to infinity
of this 
03:02 - Riemann sum
03:03 - This video introduces the idea of finding
the area between two curves. Let's start with
03:17 - some review. in calculus one, you approximate
the area between a curve and the x axis by
03:28 - dividing it up into tall skinny rectangles.
You represented the width of one of these
03:33 - rectangles using the symbols delta x, here
delta x means a small distance along the x
03:34 - axis or a small change in x values. You picked
out an x value called a sample point from
03:35 - each of these little sub intervals along the
x axis, one sample point for each rectangle.
03:36 - The sample point on the x axis for rectangle
number i is denoted by x i star. You use the
03:37 - sample points and the function f to figure
out the height of each rectangle. The height
03:38 - of rectangle number i is given by the functions
value on the sample point f of x star. From
03:39 - this, you calculate the area of each rectangle,
the area of a rectangle is base times height.
03:40 - So the area of the first rectangle is delta
x times f of x one star, the area of the second
03:41 - rectangle is delta x times f of x two star.
And the area of rectangle number i is going
03:42 - to be its base delta x times its height, f
of x i star, and so on, if there are n rectangles,
03:43 - than the last rectangle will have base delta
x and height f of x and star. So the approximate
03:44 - area under the curve is given by adding up
all these areas of all these rectangles. In
03:45 - sigma notation, this can be written as sigma,
the psalm from i equals one to n, the number
03:46 - of rectangles of the area of the rectangle,
delta x times f of x i star. The exact area
03:47 - is then given by the limit of these approximating
areas, as the number of rectangles goes to
03:48 - infinity. That's the limit as n goes to infinity
of this Riemann sum
03:49 - of areas.
03:50 - of areas.
03:51 - A limit of a Riemann sum like this is by definition,
an integral. So we can rewrite this using
03:52 - the integral sign as the integral of f of
x dx. And the bounds of integration here,
03:53 - based on our picture are from x equals a 2x
equals b. Notice that when we convert the
03:54 - limit of a Riemann sum to integral notation,
the sample points x vystar just become our
03:55 - variable x, and the delta x becomes our dx.
Now that we've reviewed these ideas of calculating
03:56 - the area under a curve, we're going to use
these same ideas to calculate the area between
03:57 - two curves. To compute the area between two
curves, y equals f of x and y equals g of
03:58 - x, in between the x values of a and b, we
can again divide up the region and a tall
03:59 - skinny rectangles as shown in this picture.
Once again, let's let delta x be the width
04:06 - of each rectangle. And let's let x i star
represent a sample point in the ife interval.
04:18 - So x sub i star is a point on the x axis that
lives in the rectangle number i. Now if we
04:25 - want to compute the area of one of these tall
skinny rectangles, as always, the area of
04:31 - a rectangle is the base times the height.
The base of any of these rectangles is given
04:37 - by delta x. But the height is different for
each rectangle. If I focus on in on rectangle
04:44 - number, I assume this is rectangle number
i right here. It stretches all the way up
04:51 - to F of the sample point f of x by star and
it stretches all the way down. To add g of
05:01 - that x, y star. So the height of that rectangle
is the gap between f of x and g of x at that
05:11 - sample point. In other words, it's the difference,
f of x sub i star minus g of x, y star. Now
05:22 - that we have an expression for the area of
one of these rectangles, we can add up all
05:27 - those areas as before, to get an expression
for the approximate area between the curves,
05:34 - it's just the sum of these areas. And as before,
we can get the exact area. By making these
05:44 - rectangles skinnier and skinnier. By taking
more of them, we take the limit as the number
05:50 - of rectangles goes to infinity of this Riemann
sum. And as always, the limit of a Riemann
05:57 - sum is given by the integral where the exabyte
stars a sample points just become our variable
06:05 - x, and the delta x becomes our dx, let's put
in our bounds of integration, we're told that
06:11 - x goes between A and B, and we have an expression
for the area between our two curves. Actually,
06:19 - this formula only works if f of x is greater
than or equal to g of x on the interval from
06:29 - a to b. That inequality guarantees that this
expression, f of x i star minus g of x i star
06:39 - will be a positive number, we want a positive
height for our rectangle, so that will get
06:43 - a positive area. If instead, f of x is less
than or equal to g of x, then you'll need
06:51 - to switch around your subtraction and take
the integral of g of x minus f of x dx instead,
06:58 - in order to get a positive area. One way to
remember what to do is just to write the integral
07:07 - as the integral from a to b of the top y value
minus the bottom y value, dx. Remembering
07:18 - that you'll need to replace the top y value
and the bottom y value with functions of x
07:24 - before you can integrate.
07:25 - A limit of a Riemann sum like this is by definition,
an integral. So we can rewrite this using
07:34 - the integral sign as the integral of f of
x dx. And the bounds of integration here,
07:40 - based on our picture are from x equals a 2x
equals b. Notice that when we convert the
07:45 - limit of a Riemann sum to integral notation,
the sample points x vystar just become our
07:54 - variable x, and the delta x becomes our dx.
Now that we've reviewed these ideas of calculating
08:03 - the area under a curve, we're going to use
these same ideas to calculate the area between
08:13 - two curves. To compute the area between two
curves, y equals f of x and y equals g of
08:26 - x, in between the x values of a and b, we
can again divide up the region and a tall
08:32 - skinny rectangles as shown in this picture.
Once again, let's let delta x be the width
08:39 - of each rectangle. And let's let x i star
represent a sample point in the ife interval.
08:44 - So x sub i star is a point on the x axis that
lives in the rectangle number i. Now if we
08:52 - want to compute the area of one of these tall
skinny rectangles, as always, the area of
09:00 - a rectangle is the base times the height.
The base of any of these rectangles is given
09:08 - by delta x. But the height is different for
each rectangle. If I focus on in on rectangle
09:17 - number, I assume this is rectangle number
i right here. It stretches all the way up
09:25 - to F of the sample point f of x by star and
it stretches all the way down. To add g of
09:35 - that x, y star. So the height of that rectangle
is the gap between f of x and g of x at that
09:43 - sample point. In other words, it's the difference,
f of x sub i star minus g of x, y star. Now
09:50 - that we have an expression for the area of
one of these rectangles, we can add up all
09:58 - those areas as before, to get an expression
for the approximate area between the curves,
10:05 - it's just the sum of these areas. And as before,
we can get the exact area. By making these
10:11 - rectangles skinnier and skinnier. By taking
more of them, we take the limit as the number
10:19 - of rectangles goes to infinity of this Riemann
sum. And as always, the limit of a Riemann
10:32 - sum is given by the integral where the exabyte
stars a sample points just become our variable
10:38 - x, and the delta x becomes our dx, let's put
in our bounds of integration, we're told that
10:45 - x goes between A and B, and we have an expression
for the area between our two curves. Actually,
10:53 - this formula only works if f of x is greater
than or equal to g of x on the interval from
11:03 - a to b. That inequality guarantees that this
expression, f of x i star minus g of x i star
11:08 - will be a positive number, we want a positive
height for our rectangle, so that will get
11:16 - a positive area. If instead, f of x is less
than or equal to g of x, then you'll need
11:23 - to switch around your subtraction and take
the integral of g of x minus f of x dx instead,
11:34 - in order to get a positive area. One way to
remember what to do is just to write the integral
11:40 - as the integral from a to b of the top y value
minus the bottom y value, dx. Remembering
11:48 - that you'll need to replace the top y value
and the bottom y value with functions of x
11:53 - before you can integrate.
11:55 - Let's look at an example. We want to find
the area between the curve y equals x squared
12:00 - plus x and y equals three minus x squared.
x squared plus x is a parabola pointing upwards.
12:05 - So that must be the red curve here, while
three minus x squared is a parabola pointing
12:11 - downwards. So that must be this blue curve.
We know that area is given by the integral
12:17 - from our starting x value to our ending x
value of our top y values minus our bottom
12:26 - y values, all integrated with respect to x,
our top y values are given by the equation
12:34 - three minus x squared, and our bottom y values
are given by the equation x squared plus x.
12:39 - Now we still need to figure out the values
of a and b, the bounds of integration. And
12:44 - from the graph, it looks like a should be
maybe about negative one and a half, and B
12:53 - should be about one, since that's where the
green area starts and ends in the horizontal
12:59 - direction. But to find exact values of a and
b, the easiest thing to do is to set these
13:05 - two equations equal to each other and solve
for x. So I'll set three minus x squared equal
13:10 - to x squared plus x, I can add x squared to
both sides to get to x squared plus x minus
13:17 - three equals zero. This factors into 2x plus
three, and x minus one, and therefore x has
13:23 - to equal negative three halves and or x equals
one, just like we thought from the graph.
13:31 - So we can finish doing our setup, our bounds
of integration are from negative three halves
13:38 - to one, and I can simplify my integrand here.
This is three minus x squared minus x squared
13:46 - minus x. Or in other words, the integral from
negative three halves to one of minus 2x squared
13:58 - minus x plus three dx. This integrates to
minus 2x cubed over three my minus x squared
14:08 - over two plus 3x, evaluated between one and
negative three halves. Now I just need to
14:16 - plug in my bounds of integration and then
simplify to get 125 20 fourths as the area.
14:25 - Let's look at an example. We want to find
the area between the curve y equals x squared
14:34 - plus x and y equals three minus x squared.
x squared plus x is a parabola pointing upwards.
14:40 - So that must be the red curve here, while
three minus x squared is a parabola pointing
14:47 - downwards. So that must be this blue curve.
We know that area is given by the integral
14:51 - from our starting x value to our ending x
value of our top y values minus our bottom
15:05 - y values, all integrated with respect to x,
our top y values are given by the equation
15:11 - three minus x squared, and our bottom y values
are given by the equation x squared plus x.
15:27 - Now we still need to figure out the values
of a and b, the bounds of integration. And
15:31 - from the graph, it looks like a should be
maybe about negative one and a half, and B
15:41 - should be about one, since that's where the
green area starts and ends in the horizontal
15:50 - direction. But to find exact values of a and
b, the easiest thing to do is to set these
16:00 - two equations equal to each other and solve
for x. So I'll set three minus x squared equal
16:08 - to x squared plus x, I can add x squared to
both sides to get to x squared plus x minus
16:16 - three equals zero. This factors into 2x plus
three, and x minus one, and therefore x has
16:23 - to equal negative three halves and or x equals
one, just like we thought from the graph.
16:30 - So we can finish doing our setup, our bounds
of integration are from negative three halves
16:40 - to one, and I can simplify my integrand here.
This is three minus x squared minus x squared
16:48 - minus x. Or in other words, the integral from
negative three halves to one of minus 2x squared
16:54 - minus x plus three dx. This integrates to
minus 2x cubed over three my minus x squared
17:00 - over two plus 3x, evaluated between one and
negative three halves. Now I just need to
17:06 - plug in my bounds of integration and then
simplify to get 125 20 fourths as the area.
17:13 - In this video, we saw that the area between
two curves in between the x values of a and
17:19 - b can be given by the integral from a to b
have the top y values minus the bottom y values.
17:29 - dx, were the top y values and bottom y values
are functions of x. More specifically, if
17:37 - the top curve is given by y equals f of x,
and the bottom curve is y equals g of x, then
17:47 - this integral is the integral from a to b
of f of x minus g of x, dx. In this video,
17:58 - we'll calculate the volumes of solids of revolution.
A solid of revolution is a three dimensional
18:04 - object that can be formed by rotating a region
of the plane around an axis. volumes formed
18:09 - by rotating a region of the plane around a
line are called solids of revolution. In this
18:16 - figure on the left, this three dimensional
object is formed by rotating a region of the
18:23 - plane shaped like this, around the x axis,
the solid on the right can be formed by rotating
18:30 - a crescent shaped region of the plane like
this, again, around the x axis. If we slice
18:34 - these two solids of revolution, using planes
perpendicular to the x axis, on the left side,
18:42 - our cross sections look like disks.
18:45 - In this video, we saw that the area between
two curves in between the x values of a and
18:56 - b can be given by the integral from a to b
have the top y values minus the bottom y values.
19:05 - dx, were the top y values and bottom y values
are functions of x. More specifically, if
19:12 - the top curve is given by y equals f of x,
and the bottom curve is y equals g of x, then
19:18 - this integral is the integral from a to b
of f of x minus g of x, dx. In this video,
19:23 - we'll calculate the volumes of solids of revolution.
A solid of revolution is a three dimensional
19:33 - object that can be formed by rotating a region
of the plane around an axis. volumes formed
19:43 - by rotating a region of the plane around a
line are called solids of revolution. In this
19:48 - figure on the left, this three dimensional
object is formed by rotating a region of the
19:54 - plane shaped like this, around the x axis,
the solid on the right can be formed by rotating
20:01 - a crescent shaped region of the plane like
this, again, around the x axis. If we slice
20:06 - these two solids of revolution, using planes
perpendicular to the x axis, on the left side,
20:13 - our cross sections look like disks.
20:16 - A disc here means the inside of a circle.
The figure on the right is different because
20:23 - it's hollow inside. And when we slice it by
planes perpendicular to the x axis, we get
20:30 - cross sections that are shaped like washers.
A washer here means the region in between
20:36 - two concentric circles. So for solids of revolution,
the cross sections can have the shape of a
20:43 - disk, or the shape of a washer. The area of
a disk is given by the familiar formula, pi
20:52 - r squared, where r is the radius. And the
area of a washer can be written as pi times
20:58 - r outer squared minus pi times our inner squared,
where our outer is the radius of the big circle,
21:05 - and our inner is the radius of the little
circle. This formula works because the area
21:15 - of the washer is just the area of the larger
circle minus the area of the inside smaller
21:22 - circle. Now we know that the volume of any
solid that can be sliced into cross sections
21:27 - using planes perpendicular to the x axis is
given by v is the integral from x equals a
21:38 - to x equals B of the area of the cross section
at point x, integrated dx. If our cross sections
21:46 - are disks, this formula becomes the integral
of pi r squared dx, where the radius R is
21:51 - a function of x. If instead, the cross sections
look like washers, then the volume formula
21:55 - becomes the integral of pi r outer squared
minus pi r inner squared dx. Again, our outer
22:04 - and our inner are functions of x here. These
formulas work when they solid a revolution
22:12 - is formed by rotating a region around the
x axis or any horizontal line. When we rotate
22:17 - around a horizontal line, then our cross sectional
discs or washers are perpendicular to the
22:21 - x axis and are thin in the x direction. So
it makes sense to integrate dx. If instead,
22:26 - we want to rotate around the y axis or a vertical
line, then our disk or wash our cross sections
22:36 - are going to be perpendicular to the y axis
and are going to be thin in the y direction.
22:44 - So when rotating around the y axis or a vertical
line, we'll need to do our integral with respect
22:53 - to y. Our cross sectional area will be a function
of y will integrate d y and our bounds of
22:58 - integration will have to be Y values, our
formulas will look pretty much the same. We'll
22:59 - just have to calculate our Radia and bounds
of integration in terms of y instead of x.
23:03 - As our first example, let's consider the region
bounded by the curve y equals a cube root
23:07 - of x, the x axis and the line x equals eight.
We want to find the volume of the solid of
23:10 - revolution found by rotating this region around
the x axis. or cross sections here are going
23:17 - to be discs. And these discs are thin in the
extraction. So we're going to be integrating
23:25 - dx, our smallest x value is zero, and our
largest is eight. So those are our bounds
23:31 - of integration. And we want to integrate pi
times the radius squared dx. Now the radius
23:36 - of our disks is given by the y coordinate
on this curve. So we can write r is equal
23:43 - to y, which is equal to the cube root of x
according to our equation. So we can rewrite
23:52 - the volume as the integral from zero to eight
of pi times the cube root of x squared dx,
24:07 - I can pull out the PI and rewrite this integral
using exponents and integrate and then evaluate
24:13 - using bounds of integration to get three fifths
pi times eight to the five thirds minus zero.
24:20 - Now, eight to the five thirds means eight
to the 1/3 raised to the fifth power, eight
24:28 - to the 1/3 is two and two to the fifth is
32. So this expression simplifies to three
24:33 - fifths pi times 32, or 96/5
24:35 - A disc here means the inside of a circle.
The figure on the right is different because
24:39 - it's hollow inside. And when we slice it by
planes perpendicular to the x axis, we get
24:45 - cross sections that are shaped like washers.
A washer here means the region in between
24:49 - two concentric circles. So for solids of revolution,
the cross sections can have the shape of a
24:55 - disk, or the shape of a washer. The area of
a disk is given by the familiar formula, pi
25:01 - r squared, where r is the radius. And the
area of a washer can be written as pi times
25:11 - r outer squared minus pi times our inner squared,
where our outer is the radius of the big circle,
25:16 - and our inner is the radius of the little
circle. This formula works because the area
25:19 - of the washer is just the area of the larger
circle minus the area of the inside smaller
25:24 - circle. Now we know that the volume of any
solid that can be sliced into cross sections
25:29 - using planes perpendicular to the x axis is
given by v is the integral from x equals a
25:36 - to x equals B of the area of the cross section
at point x, integrated dx. If our cross sections
25:42 - are disks, this formula becomes the integral
of pi r squared dx, where the radius R is
25:48 - a function of x. If instead, the cross sections
look like washers, then the volume formula
25:55 - becomes the integral of pi r outer squared
minus pi r inner squared dx. Again, our outer
26:01 - and our inner are functions of x here. These
formulas work when they solid a revolution
26:05 - is formed by rotating a region around the
x axis or any horizontal line. When we rotate
26:11 - around a horizontal line, then our cross sectional
discs or washers are perpendicular to the
26:20 - x axis and are thin in 
the x direction. So it makes sense to integrate
26:34 - dx. If instead, we want to rotate around the
y axis or a vertical line, then our disk or
26:39 - wash our cross sections are going to be perpendicular
to the y axis and are going to be thin in
26:49 - the y direction. So when rotating around the
y axis or a vertical line, we'll need to do
26:55 - our integral with respect to y. Our cross
sectional area will be a function of y will
27:04 - integrate d y and our bounds of integration
will have to be Y values, our formulas will
27:20 - look pretty much the same. We'll just have
to calculate our Radia and bounds of integration
27:29 - in terms of y instead of x. As our first example,
let's consider the region bounded by the curve
27:42 - y equals a cube root of x, the x axis and
the line x equals eight. We want to find the
27:49 - volume of the solid of revolution found by
rotating this region around the x axis. or
27:58 - cross sections here are going to be discs.
And these discs are thin in the extraction.
28:07 - So we're going to be integrating dx, our smallest
x value is zero, and our largest is eight.
28:14 - So those are our bounds of integration. And
we want to integrate pi times the radius squared
28:21 - dx. Now the radius of our disks is given by
the y coordinate on this curve. So we can
28:34 - write r is equal to y, which is equal to the
cube root of x according to our equation.
28:46 - So we can rewrite the volume as the integral
from zero to eight of pi times the cube root
28:58 - of x squared dx, I can pull out the PI and
rewrite this integral using exponents and
29:09 - integrate and then evaluate using bounds of
integration to get three fifths pi times eight
29:15 - to the five thirds minus zero. Now, eight
to the five thirds means eight to the 1/3
29:22 - raised to the fifth power, eight to the 1/3
is two and two to the fifth is 32. So this
29:33 - expression simplifies to three fifths pi times
32, or 96/5
29:39 - pie.
29:40 - pie.
29:41 - As our next example, let's consider the region
in the first quadrant bounded by two curves,
29:44 - the curve y equals the cube root of x and
y equals 1/4 times x. We'll start by rotating
29:51 - this region around the x axis to get this
sort of hollow base shape. Notice that our
29:58 - cross sections this time are shaped like washers,
where the outer circle of the washer is swept
30:03 - out by the curve y equals cube root of x,
and the inner circle is swept out by the curve
30:10 - y equals 1/4 X. We know our volume is given
by the integral of pi times our outer squared
30:18 - minus pi times our inner squared. And since
our washers are thin in the x direction, we
30:23 - know we'll need to integrate dx, our bounds
of integration are just our lowest x value
30:27 - of zero, and our largest x value, which is
where these two curves intersect, which is
30:38 - an x value of eight. We can confirm that the
two curves intersect when x equals eight by
30:42 - setting them equal to each other. And solving
for x, dividing both sides by x to the 1/3.
30:51 - And multiplying both sides by four gives us
four equals x to the two thirds. And raising
30:54 - both sides to the three halves power gives
us x equals four to three halves, or x equals
30:58 - eight.
30:59 - As our next example, let's consider the region
in the first quadrant bounded by two curves,
31:05 - the curve y equals the cube root of x and
y equals 1/4 times x. We'll start by rotating
31:14 - this region around the x axis to get this
sort of hollow base shape. Notice that our
31:20 - cross sections this time are shaped like washers,
where the outer circle of the washer is swept
31:27 - out by the curve y equals cube root of x,
and the inner circle is swept out by the curve
31:41 - y equals 1/4 X. We know our volume is given
by the integral of pi times our outer squared
31:48 - minus pi times our inner squared. And since
our washers are thin in the x direction, we
31:52 - know we'll need to integrate dx, our bounds
of integration are just our lowest x value
31:58 - of zero, and our largest x value, which is
where these two curves intersect, which is
32:07 - an x value of eight. We can confirm that the
two curves intersect when x equals eight by
32:12 - setting them equal to each other. And solving
for x, dividing both sides by x to the 1/3.
32:19 - And multiplying both sides by four gives us
four equals x to the two thirds. And raising
32:25 - both sides to the three halves power gives
us x equals four to three halves, or x equals
32:34 - eight.
32:35 - This confirms we have the correct bound of
integration here. Now we need to figure out
32:42 - a formula for the outer radius as a function
of x and a formula for the inner radius. Also,
32:51 - This confirms we have the correct bound of
integration here. Now we need to figure out
32:56 - a formula for the outer radius as a function
of x and a formula for the inner radius. Also,
33:01 - since the outer circle is swept out by the
curve y equals cube root of x, the outer radius
33:08 - is just given by the y coordinate of this
curve as a function of x, that's the cube
33:14 - root of x. Now the inner radius is given by
the y coordinate of this line, and the y coordinate
33:24 - of this line as a function of x is 1/4 x.
So we set up an equation for the volume of
33:33 - our solid and I routine computation gives
us a volume of 128 fifteenth's times pi. Now
33:38 - let's switch gears and rotate this region
around the y axis instead. Our cross sections
33:44 - are still washers, but this time the washers
are thin in the y direction. So we're going
33:51 - to be integrating with respect to y. Our bounds
of integration are also y values and start
33:58 - at the minimum y value of zero and the maximum
Y value of two, that corresponds to this intersection,
34:05 - where x equals eight, and y, which is the
cube root of x, or 1/4 times x is then equal
34:13 - to two. For this problem, we need our our
outer and our inner to the functions of y.
34:16 - From the picture, we see that our outer is
actually the x coordinate on this line. The
34:21 - line has the equation y equals 1/4 x. And
so x is equal to four y. So that gives us
34:31 - our outer as a function of y. defined our
inner, we can do the same sort of thing using
34:39 - the x coordinate of the curve, y equals cube
root of x. But writing that x coordinate in
34:46 - terms of y, we have y equals the cube root
of x means that x is equal to y cubed. And
34:55 - so our inner is equal to y cubed as a function
of y. putting this all together, we have an
35:01 - equation for volume. We can simplify this
and integrate to get an answer of 512 pi over
35:08 - 21. In this video, we calculated the volumes
of solids of revolution, using the disk and
35:15 - the washer methods, and the following formulas.
One way to calculate the volume of a loaf
35:23 - of bread is to slice it into slices, and calculate
the volume of each slice separately. That's
35:31 - the idea to keep in mind as we cover this
topic, on volumes using cross sections. A
35:38 - lot of three dimensional objects are kind
of like loaves of bread, and can be naturally
35:44 - sliced into slabs or slices like this. Let's
suppose we've sliced our object into n slabs,
35:51 - we'll call them s one s two through sn in
this picture, and is seven, here's s one,
35:57 - here's s two, here's s3, and so on, we'll
assume we've sliced in such a way that each
36:03 - slice is the same thickness, we'll call that
thickness delta x. Well, the volume of the
36:10 - solid is just the sum of the volumes of the
slices. And sigma notation, we can write this
36:14 - as the sum from i equals one to n, the number
of slabs volume of s by the I slab. Now the
36:19 - volume of the slab is approximately its cross
sectional area times its width. By cross sectional
36:25 - area of the slab, I mean the area of the front
or the back part of the slice, where you might
36:37 - spread peanut butter. Well, now, as you've
noticed from making peanut butter sandwiches,
36:42 - the area of the front of the slice might be
slightly different from the area of the back
36:54 - of the slice. So what we'll do is for each
interval, I, each slab will just pick a sample
36:59 - point x vystar, that's in that I've interval,
it could be on the left endpoint, or it could
37:07 - be on the right endpoint, or it could be in
the middle somewhere. And we'll just look
37:13 - at the cross sectional area, I'll call it
a at x, y star that represents the area if
37:23 - I were to go karate chop right at that x y
star and figure out the cross sectional area
37:31 - at that point.
37:32 - since the outer circle is swept out by the
curve y equals cube root of x, the outer radius
37:46 - is just given by the y coordinate of this
curve as a function of x, that's the cube
37:57 - root of x. Now the inner radius is given by
the y coordinate of this line, and the y coordinate
38:06 - of this line as a function of x is 1/4 x.
So we set up an equation for the volume of
38:16 - our solid and I routine computation gives
us a volume of 128 fifteenth's times pi. Now
38:21 - let's switch gears and rotate this region
around the y axis instead. Our cross sections
38:30 - are still washers, but this time the washers
are thin in the y direction. So we're going
38:45 - to be integrating with respect to y. Our bounds
of integration are also y values and start
38:57 - at the minimum y value of zero and the maximum
Y value of two, that corresponds to this intersection,
39:06 - where x equals eight, and y, which is the
cube root of x, or 1/4 times x is then equal
39:14 - to two. For this problem, we need our our
outer and our inner to the functions of y.
39:23 - From the picture, we see that our outer is
actually the x coordinate on this line. The
39:30 - line has the equation y equals 1/4 x. And
so x is equal to four y. So that gives us
39:38 - our outer as a function of y. defined our
inner, we can do the same sort of thing using
39:42 - the x coordinate of the curve, y equals cube
root of x. But writing that x coordinate in
39:51 - terms of y, we have y equals the cube root
of x means that x is equal to y cubed. And
40:00 - so our inner is equal to y cubed as a function
of y. putting this all together, we have an
40:11 - equation for volume. We can simplify this
and integrate to get an answer of 512 pi over
40:21 - 21. In this video, we calculated the volumes
of solids of revolution, using the disk and
40:28 - the washer methods, and the following formulas.
One way to calculate the volume of a loaf
40:33 - of bread is to slice it into slices, and calculate
the volume of each slice separately. That's
40:40 - the idea to keep in mind as we cover this
topic, on volumes using cross sections. A
40:44 - lot of three dimensional objects are kind
of like loaves of bread, and can be naturally
40:47 - sliced into slabs or slices like this. Let's
suppose we've sliced our object into n slabs,
40:54 - we'll call them s one s two through sn in
this picture, and is seven, here's s one,
41:02 - here's s two, here's s3, and so on, we'll
assume we've sliced in such a way that each
41:08 - slice is the same thickness, we'll call that
thickness delta x. Well, the volume of the
41:12 - solid is just the sum of the volumes of the
slices. And sigma notation, we can write this
41:18 - as the sum from i equals one to n, the number
of slabs volume of s by the I slab. Now the
41:26 - volume of the slab is approximately its cross
sectional area times its width. By cross sectional
41:33 - area of the slab, I mean the area of the front
or the back part of the slice, where you might
41:45 - spread peanut butter. Well, now, as you've
noticed from making peanut butter sandwiches,
41:51 - the area of the front of the slice might be
slightly different from the area of the back
41:57 - of the slice. So what we'll do is for each
interval, I, each slab will just pick a sample
42:09 - point x vystar, that's in that I've interval,
it could be on the left endpoint, or it could
42:14 - be on the right endpoint, or it could be in
the middle somewhere. And we'll just look
42:20 - at the cross sectional area, I'll call it
a at x, y star that represents the area if
42:30 - I were to go karate chop right at that x y
star and figure out the cross sectional area
42:35 - at that point.
42:36 - Now we can go back and write our volume as
the cross sectional area at x star times delta
42:45 - x the thickness of the slice. Now this is
just an approximation of volume, because this
42:50 - expression here gives you the volume as if
the slices are very regular, and have the
42:56 - same area from one side to the other. But
it's a good approximation if the slices are
43:00 - thin. And in fact, we can calculate the exact
volume by taking the limit as the slices get
43:11 - thinner and thinner. Or in other words, as
the number of slices goes to infinity. What
43:23 - we have here is the limit of a Riemann sum.
And therefore, we can rewrite it as an integral
43:34 - where the x i star becomes our variable x
and the delta x becomes r dx. For the bounds
43:43 - of integration, we'll just use the abstract
x values of a and b for a real problem. We
43:50 - would fill these in based on In the context
of the problem, this gives us an abstract
43:59 - expression for the volume of a three dimensional
object. But in practice, in order to compute
44:05 - volumes like this, we'll first need a formula
for a of x, the cross sectional area as a
44:15 - function of x. As an example, let's try to
find the volume of a solid whose base is an
44:22 - ellipse given by this equation, and whose
cross sections perpendicular to the x axis
44:27 - are squares. First, let me graph the base,
it looks like an ellipse that's thinner in
44:33 - the extraction than in the y direction. So
something like this. Now sitting above this
44:39 - base, are a bunch of squares. And the squares
are oriented in such a way that they're perpendicular
44:50 - to the x axis. So they're oriented sort of
like this, I'll try to draw a square here,
45:00 - that's supposed to be coming out of the picture
here. And here's another square, again, coming
45:07 - out of the picture. Here's a slightly better
picture that I drew using Mathematica. It's
45:15 - tilted. So we're looking at it from below,
where you can see the ellipse here. And you
45:26 - can see the square cross sections, the x axis
is going in this direction, that's x and the
45:41 - y axis is in that direction. This picture
is actually an approximation of the solid,
45:47 - where they're only about eight or 10 slices,
each one's kind of sick and has the same area
45:56 - on the front and the back. better picture
of the solid is this one. Here, the slices
46:00 - are infinitely thin, but they're still square
shaped. And they're still oriented in such
46:05 - a way that they're perpendicular to the x
axis. Now we know that volume is given by
46:13 - the integral from a to b of area as a function
of x dx. On our lips, the minimum x value
46:20 - is negative two, and the maximum x value is
two. So I can write those in for my bounds
46:25 - of integration. Also, I know that the area
of a square is just the side length squared.
46:31 - So I can write my cross sectional area as
s of x squared, where s of x is the side length
46:39 - of the square as a function of x. Notice that
for different x values, my side lengths are
46:47 - different. But my side length is always twice
the y value twice the distance from the x
46:53 - axis to the y value on the ellipse. So I'll
rewrite my formula as two times y as a function
47:01 - of x squared. I can simplify this a little
bit as the integral of four times y of x squared,
47:12 - dx. Now all I need to do is find a formula
for y as a function of x. And since I've got
47:18 - this equation up here, relating y and x, all
I have to do is solve for y in terms of x.
47:23 - In fact, I can get by solving for y squared,
since I've really got y squared in my formula.
47:28 - solving for y squared, I have y squared over
nine is equal to one minus x squared over
47:33 - four, which means that y squared is equal
to nine times one minus x squared
47:39 - Now we can go back and write our volume as
the cross sectional area at x star times delta
47:48 - x the thickness of the slice. Now this is
just an approximation of volume, because this
47:55 - expression here gives you the volume as if
the slices are very regular, and have the
48:05 - same area from one side to the other. But
it's a good approximation if the slices are
48:11 - thin. And in fact, we can calculate the exact
volume by taking the limit as the slices get
48:14 - thinner and thinner. Or in other words, as
the number of slices goes to infinity. What
48:20 - we have here is the limit of a Riemann sum.
And therefore, we can rewrite it as an integral
48:29 - where the x i star becomes our variable x
and the delta x becomes r dx. For the bounds
48:32 - of integration, we'll just use the abstract
x values of a and b for a real problem. We
48:39 - would fill these in based on In the context
of the problem, this gives us an abstract
48:44 - expression for the volume of a three dimensional
object. But in practice, in order to compute
48:49 - volumes like this, we'll first need a formula
for a of x, the cross sectional area as a
48:53 - function of x. As an example, let's try to
find the volume of a solid whose base is an
49:02 - ellipse given by this equation, and whose
cross sections perpendicular to the x axis
49:12 - are squares. First, let me graph the base,
it looks like an ellipse that's thinner in
49:18 - the extraction than in the y direction. So
something like this. Now sitting above this
49:23 - base, are a bunch of squares. And the squares
are oriented in such a way that they're perpendicular
49:30 - to the x axis. So they're oriented sort of
like this, I'll try to draw a square here,
49:37 - that's supposed to be coming out of the picture
here. And here's another square, again, coming
49:43 - out of the picture. Here's a slightly better
picture that I drew using Mathematica. It's
49:54 - tilted. So we're looking at it from below,
where you can see the ellipse here. And you
50:04 - can see the square cross sections, the x axis
is going in this direction, that's x and the
50:18 - y axis is in that direction. This picture
is actually an approximation of the solid,
50:30 - where they're only about eight or 10 slices,
each one's kind of sick and has the same area
50:37 - on the front and the back. better picture
of the solid is this one. Here, the slices
50:42 - are infinitely thin, but they're still square
shaped. And they're still oriented in such
50:46 - a way that they're perpendicular to the x
axis. Now we know that volume is given by
50:52 - the integral from a to b of area as a function
of x dx. On our lips, the minimum x value
50:58 - is negative two, and the maximum x value is
two. So I can write those in for my bounds
51:03 - of integration. Also, I know that the area
of a square is just the side length squared.
51:08 - So I can write my cross sectional area as
s of x squared, where s of x is the side length
51:19 - of the square as a function of x. Notice that
for different x values, my side lengths are
51:23 - different. But my side length is always twice
the y value twice the distance from the x
51:29 - axis to the y value on the ellipse. So I'll
rewrite my formula as two times y as a function
51:39 - of x squared. I can simplify this a little
bit as the integral of four times y of x squared,
51:48 - dx. Now all I need to do is find a formula
for y as a function of x. And since I've got
51:54 - this equation up here, relating y and x, all
I have to do is solve for y in terms of x.
52:01 - In fact, I can get by solving for y squared,
since I've really got y squared in my formula.
52:08 - solving for y squared, I have y squared over
nine is equal to one minus x squared over
52:14 - four, which means that y squared is equal
to nine times one minus x squared
52:20 - over four.
52:21 - over four.
52:22 - Now I plug this into my volume equation. And
I get the integral from negative two to four
52:28 - times nine, one minus x squared over four
dx. I'll pull out the four times nine that's
52:33 - 36. and integrate. Plugging in values and
simplifying, we get a final answer of 96.
52:39 - Now, how would this problem be different if
we used cross sections that were perpendicular
52:45 - to the y axis instead of the x axis? Well,
for one thing, our picture would look a little
52:52 - bit different. Since our squares would now
be running in the other direction. Since our
52:56 - squares are now fin in the y direction, instead
of the extraction, it makes sense to have
53:01 - the width of a slab B delta y, and to compute
our volume as an integral with respect to
53:08 - y. Our bounds of integration now and they
also need to be Y values. So they run from
53:11 - the minimum y value of negative three to the
maximum y value of three. And our cross sectional
53:15 - area should also be written in terms of y.
area is still side length squared. But now
53:23 - our side length is actually twice our x value,
instead of twice our y value. And we can write
53:30 - our x value squared in terms of our y value
as four times one minus y squared over nine.
53:41 - Therefore, our area, which is our side length
squared, which is 2x, quantity squared, or
53:47 - 4x squared, is going to be equal to 16 times
one minus y squared over nine, we'll need
53:54 - to calculate our volume by taking the integral
from negative three to three of 16 times one
54:02 - minus y squared over nine d y. If we integrate
this, we get an answer of 64. a different
54:10 - answer from the answer to our first problem,
and it makes sense that we get a different
54:17 - answer, because we now have a different three
dimensional object with a different shape
54:21 - and a different volume. In this video, we
saw that if we divided three dimensional objects
54:26 - into slices, then the volume of the three
dimensional object is the integral of the
54:30 - cross sectional area, dx. In this video, I'll
derive a formula to calculate the length of
54:36 - a curve given as a function y equals f of
x. For a curve like this one that's made up
54:45 - of a bunch of straight line segments, it's
easy to calculate the length just by using
54:54 - the distance formula to find the length of
each line segment. The distance formula says
55:00 - the distance between two points x one, y one,
and x two, y two is given by the square root
55:08 - of x two minus x one squared plus y two minus
y one squared. Applying this formula to the
55:17 - first line segment, connecting the points
one, two, and two, three, we get a length
55:20 - of the square root of two minus one squared
plus three minus two squared, which is the
55:27 - square root of two, the length of the next
line segment can be calculated similarly,
55:34 - and the next piece has length two, we don't
even need the distance formula for that one.
55:44 - And the last line segment has a length of
the square to five. If we add up all the lengths
55:49 - of these four line segments, we get a total
length of the curve of two times the square
55:58 - root of five, plus the square root of two
plus two,
56:01 - Now I plug this into my volume equation. And
I get the integral from negative two to four
56:10 - times nine, one minus x squared over four
dx. I'll pull out the four times nine that's
56:15 - 36. and integrate. Plugging in values and
simplifying, we get a final answer of 96.
56:20 - Now, how would this problem be different if
we used cross sections that were perpendicular
56:23 - to the y axis instead of the x axis? Well,
for one thing, our picture would look a little
56:30 - bit different. Since our squares would now
be running in the other direction. Since our
56:35 - squares are now fin in the y direction, instead
of the extraction, it makes sense to have
56:40 - the width of a slab B delta y, and to compute
our volume as an integral with respect to
56:46 - y. Our bounds of integration now and they
also need to be Y values. So they run from
56:51 - the minimum y value of negative three to the
maximum y value of three. And our cross sectional
56:58 - area should also be written in terms of y.
area is still side length squared. But now
57:06 - our side length is actually twice our x value,
instead of twice our y value. And we can write
57:14 - our x value squared in terms of our y value
as four times one minus y squared over nine.
57:23 - Therefore, our area, which is our side length
squared, which is 2x, quantity squared, or
57:31 - 4x squared, is going to be equal to 16 times
one minus y squared over nine, we'll need
57:37 - to calculate our volume by taking the integral
from negative three to three of 16 times one
57:42 - minus y squared over nine d y. If we integrate
this, we get an answer of 64. a different
57:48 - answer from the answer to our first problem,
and it makes sense that we get a different
57:53 - answer, because we now have a different three
dimensional object with a different shape
57:58 - and a different volume. In this video, we
saw that if we divided three dimensional objects
58:05 - into slices, then the volume of the three
dimensional object is the integral of the
58:09 - cross sectional area, dx. In this video, I'll
derive a formula to calculate the length of
58:18 - a curve given as a function y equals f of
x. For a curve like this one that's made up
58:29 - of a bunch of straight line segments, it's
easy to calculate the length just by using
58:36 - the distance formula to find the length of
each line segment. The distance formula says
58:43 - the distance between two points x one, y one,
and x two, y two is given by the square root
58:52 - of x two minus x one squared plus y two minus
y one squared. Applying this formula to the
59:01 - first line segment, connecting the points
one, two, and two, three, we get a length
59:08 - of the square root of two minus one squared
plus three minus two squared, which is the
59:15 - square root of two, the length of the next
line segment can be calculated similarly,
59:22 - and the next piece has length two, we don't
even need the distance formula for that one.
59:29 - And the last line segment has a length of
the square to five. If we add up all the lengths
59:36 - of these four line segments, we get a total
length of the curve of two times the square
59:43 - root of five, plus the square root of two
plus two,
59:45 - we can use the same process to approximate
the length of any curve by dividing it up
59:52 - into n small pieces, and approximate the length
of one small curved piece with a straight
59:56 - line segment. And using the distance formula
to calculate the length of these line segments,
60:04 - in this picture, the curve is divided up into
nine sub intervals. I'll label the corresponding
60:12 - points on the x axis, x zero for a x 1x, two,
all the way through x eight and x nine is
60:19 - B. And I can label the points on my curve.
So here's the sixth point P six has x coordinates
60:27 - xx, and then y coordinate will be f of x x,
since my curve is given by the equation y
60:34 - equals f of x. More generally, I have N sub
intervals. And I'll label an arbitrary point
60:46 - piece of I. The point before it is then a
piece of i minus one. And the length of the
60:59 - ice segment is given by the distance between
P sub i and P sub i minus one. So that's the
61:08 - square root of x sub i minus x sub i minus
one squared plus f of x sub i minus f of x
61:16 - sub i minus one squared by the distance formula.
The total length of the curve can be approximated
61:24 - by adding the lengths of all these line segments
up. So that's the sum from i equals one to
61:32 - N for the N line segments of these lengths.
This is starting to look a little bit like
61:36 - a Riemann sum because of the Sigma sign, but
it's missing the delta x That I usually have
61:42 - out here. So I'm going to use a trick, I'm
going to multiply each term of this expression
61:48 - by x sub i minus x sub i minus one divided
by x sub i minus x sub i minus one. This doesn't
61:55 - change the value of my expression, but it
does introduce a delta x over delta x into
62:01 - my equation, because delta x represents the
width of a sub interval. And that's equal
62:12 - to x by minus x, y minus one, I'm going to
suck the factor in the denominator inside
62:19 - the square root sign, notice I have to square
it, when I pull it inside the square root
62:24 - sign. Now I'm going to rewrite my fraction
inside the square root sign. Now this first
62:32 - fraction is just one, and the second fraction
can be rewritten with a single squared sign.
62:41 - And the second expression should look familiar
to you. It's the expression for the slope
62:45 - of a secant line. At effects, I n x i minus
one are very close to each other, the slope
62:50 - of that secant line is very close to the slope
of a tangent line for at a point in that interval.
63:00 - In fact, you might recall that the mean value
theorem says that the slope of the secant
63:06 - line is actually exactly equal to the slope
of a tangent line. For some point, I'll call
63:13 - it x i star in that interval. So I'll rewrite
my expression for the approximate length of
63:18 - the curve. And since x i minus x i minus one
can be written as delta x, I have a Riemann
63:26 - sum here. So if I want to find the exact arc
length, I just need to take the limit of this
63:34 - Riemann sum. This is the limit as the number
of intervals goes to infinity. We know that
63:40 - the limit of a Riemann sum is given by an
integral. So the arc length is given by the
63:46 - integral of the square root of one plus f
prime of x squared dx, starting from the first
63:51 - x value of A to the last x value of b. And
so we've derived a formula for arc length.
64:06 - Sometimes, this formula is also written with
the alternative notation of dydx, instead
64:14 - of f prime of x. Let's use the arc length
formula to find the length of the curve y
64:24 - equals x to the three halves between x equals
one and x equals four. That's this section
64:32 - of the curve drawn.
64:33 - we can use the same process to approximate
the length of any curve by dividing it up
64:40 - into n small pieces, and approximate the length
of one small curved piece with a straight
64:47 - line segment. And using the distance formula
to calculate the length of these line segments,
64:56 - in this picture, the curve is divided up into
nine sub intervals. I'll label the corresponding
65:06 - points on the x axis, x zero for a x 1x, two,
all the way through x eight and x nine is
65:14 - B. And I can label the points on my curve.
So here's the sixth point P six has x coordinates
65:26 - xx, and then y coordinate will be f of x x,
since my curve is given by the equation y
65:36 - equals f of x. More generally, I have N sub
intervals. And I'll label an arbitrary point
65:46 - piece of I. The point before it is then a
piece of i minus one. And the length of the
65:53 - ice segment is given by the distance between
P sub i and P sub i minus one. So that's the
66:00 - square root of x sub i minus x sub i minus
one squared plus f of x sub i minus f of x
66:11 - sub i minus one squared by the distance formula.
The total length of the curve can be approximated
66:24 - by adding the lengths of all these line segments
up. So that's the sum from i equals one to
66:30 - N for the N line segments of these lengths.
This is starting to look a little bit like
66:35 - a Riemann sum because of the Sigma sign, but
it's missing the delta x That I usually have
66:43 - out here. So I'm going to use a trick, I'm
going to multiply each term of this expression
66:51 - by x sub i minus x sub i minus one divided
by x sub i minus x sub i minus one. This doesn't
66:59 - change the value of my expression, but it
does introduce a delta x over delta x into
67:05 - my equation, because delta x represents the
width of a sub interval. And that's equal
67:09 - to x by minus x, y minus one, I'm going to
suck the factor in the denominator inside
67:18 - the square root sign, notice I have to square
it, when I pull it inside the square root
67:27 - sign. Now I'm going to rewrite my fraction
inside the square root sign. Now this first
67:34 - fraction is just one, and the second fraction
can be rewritten with a single squared sign.
67:41 - And the second expression should look familiar
to you. It's the expression for the slope
67:48 - of a secant line. At effects, I n x i minus
one are very close to each other, the slope
67:58 - of that secant line is very close to the slope
of a tangent line for at a point in that interval.
68:04 - In fact, you might recall that the mean value
theorem says that the slope of the secant
68:11 - line is actually exactly equal to the slope
of a tangent line. For some point, I'll call
68:19 - it x i star in that interval. So I'll rewrite
my expression for the approximate length of
68:21 - the curve. And since x i minus x i minus one
can be written as delta x, I have a Riemann
68:27 - sum here. So if I want to find the exact arc
length, I just need to take the limit of this
68:32 - Riemann sum. This is the limit as the number
of intervals goes to infinity. We know that
68:39 - the limit of a Riemann sum is given by an
integral. So the arc length is given by the
68:44 - integral of the square root of one plus f
prime of x squared dx, starting from the first
68:50 - x value of A to the last x value of b. And
so we've derived a formula for arc length.
69:00 - Sometimes, this formula is also written with
the alternative notation of dydx, instead
69:06 - of f prime of x. Let's use the arc length
formula to find the length of the curve y
69:13 - equals x to the three halves between x equals
one and x equals four. That's this section
69:18 - of the curve drawn.
69:19 - Here's the general formula for arc length.
And since dydx, for our curve is three halves
69:23 - x to the one half, we get that arc length
is the integral from one to four of the square
69:31 - root of one plus three halves x to the one
half squared dx. After simplifying a little
69:39 - bit, we can use use substitution to rewrite
this. So we get the integral from 13 fourths,
69:45 - to 10 of the square root of u times four ninths
do which integrates to u to the three halves
69:54 - divided by three halves, times four ninths,
evaluated between 10 and 13 fourths, which
69:59 - after some computation works out to 1/27 times
at the square root of 10 minus 13, the squared
70:06 - of 13 or approximately 7.6 units, which seems
about right, based on the graph, taking into
70:13 - account the fact that this scale here is by
twos on the y axis. In this video, we found
70:21 - the formula for the arc length of a curve.
If the curve stretches from x equals a to
70:27 - x equals b, then the arc length is given by
the integral from a to b of the square root
70:33 - of one plus f prime of x squared dx. This
video introduces the idea of work from physics
70:40 - and the key role of integration in doing work
calculations. If a constant force f is applied
70:46 - to move an object a distance d, then the work
done to move the object is defined to be work
70:53 - equals force times distance, or in symbols,
w equals F times d. The units of force can
70:58 - be given in metric units, or in bold fashion,
English units. Since force is mass times acceleration,
71:06 - the units of force are going to be units of
mass, which are kilograms, times units of
71:11 - acceleration, meters per second squared. This
collection of units is also called a Newton.
71:16 - In English units, force is given typically,
in terms of pounds. Now the units of work
71:20 - since work is force times distance, and distance
in metric units is in meters. That gives units
71:26 - for work of kilograms meters squared per second
squared, or we can write it work as Newton
71:32 - meters. And these collection of units is also
given its own name, which is the joule. If
71:40 - we're using English units for work, work again
is force times distance. So the units become
71:48 - pounds times feet are usually this is written
instead, as a foot pound. Now, if I give you
71:55 - my weight in pounds, I weigh about 140 pounds.
Those pounds are already and I get it a force.
72:02 - So that 140 pounds, my weight is also telling
the force of gravity on my body. But if I
72:09 - tell you instead, that my mass is 63.5 kilograms,
well, that's a unit of mass not a unit of
72:14 - force. So if I want to know the force, due
to gravity on my body, I'm gonna have to multiply
72:20 - that 63.5 by the acceleration due to gravity,
which is 9.8 meters per second squared. That
72:24 - product works out to be 622.3 kilogram meters
per second squared. Notice that we're now
72:30 - have the right units for force, we could also
say, that's the force of gravity on my body
72:40 - is 622.3 Newtons.
72:42 - Here's the general formula for arc length.
And since dydx, for our curve is three halves
72:54 - x to the one half, we get that arc length
is the integral from one to four of the square
73:03 - root of one plus three halves x to the one
half squared dx. After simplifying a little
73:10 - bit, we can use use substitution to rewrite
this. So we get the integral from 13 fourths,
73:12 - to 10 of the square root of u times four ninths
do which integrates to u to the three halves
73:17 - divided by three halves, times four ninths,
evaluated between 10 and 13 fourths, which
73:23 - after some computation works out to 1/27 times
at the square root of 10 minus 13, the squared
73:29 - of 13 or approximately 7.6 units, which seems
about right, based on the graph, taking into
73:36 - account the fact that this scale here is by
twos on the y axis. In this video, we found
73:48 - the formula for the arc length of a curve.
If the curve stretches from x equals a to
73:59 - x equals b, then the arc length is given by
the integral from a to b of the square root
74:06 - of one plus f prime of x squared dx. This
video introduces the idea of work from physics
74:13 - and the key role of integration in doing work
calculations. If a constant force f is applied
74:22 - to move an object a distance d, then the work
done to move the object is defined to be work
74:30 - equals force times distance, or in symbols,
w equals F times d. The units of force can
74:37 - be given in metric units, or in bold fashion,
English units. Since force is mass times acceleration,
74:45 - the units of force are going to be units of
mass, which are kilograms, times units of
74:53 - acceleration, meters per second squared. This
collection of units is also called a Newton.
75:01 - In English units, force is given typically,
in terms of pounds. Now the units of work
75:07 - since work is force times distance, and distance
in metric units is in meters. That gives units
75:14 - for work of kilograms meters squared per second
squared, or we can write it work as Newton
75:21 - meters. And these collection of units is also
given its own name, which is the joule. If
75:28 - we're using English units for work, work again
is force times distance. So the units become
75:35 - pounds times feet are usually this is written
instead, as a foot pound. Now, if I give you
75:40 - my weight in pounds, I weigh about 140 pounds.
Those pounds are already and I get it a force.
75:46 - So that 140 pounds, my weight is also telling
the force of gravity on my body. But if I
75:51 - tell you instead, that my mass is 63.5 kilograms,
well, that's a unit of mass not a unit of
75:58 - force. So if I want to know the force, due
to gravity on my body, I'm gonna have to multiply
76:08 - that 63.5 by the acceleration due to gravity,
which is 9.8 meters per second squared. That
76:16 - product works out to be 622.3 kilogram meters
per second squared. Notice that we're now
76:22 - have the right units for force, we could also
say, that's the force of gravity on my body
76:28 - is 622.3 Newtons.
76:29 - Now that we familiarize ourselves with units
a bit, let's do some examples. As our first
76:31 - example, how much work is done to lift a two
pound book off the floor onto a shelf that's
76:36 - five feet high? Well, we know that work is
force times distance, and two pounds is already
76:41 - a unit of force. And distance is five feet.
So the work done is 10 foot pounds. Now let's
76:47 - do the same problem in metric units. The two
pound book is actually a naught point nine
76:55 - kilogram book, and we're lifting it off the
floor onto a shelf that's about 1.5 meters
76:59 - high. Well, work is still force times distance.
But now the force is point nine kilograms
77:06 - times the acceleration due to gravity 9.8
meters per second squared, times our distance
77:11 - of 1.5 meters. That gives us a product of
13.23 kilograms meters squared per second
77:25 - squared, or in other words, 13.23 jewels.
In the previous two examples, force was constant,
77:33 - so we could just multiply force by distance
to get work. Now let's consider the case where
77:38 - force is not constant. Let's say a particle
moves along the x axis from a point x equals
77:46 - a to a point x equals b. According to a force,
F of x, that's a function of x and varies
77:51 - with x. How much work is done in moving a
particle although the force is not constant,
77:56 - on the whole interval from a to b, if we divide
up that interval, into a bunch of little sub
78:01 - intervals, each of width delta x, then on
any particular sub interval The force is going
78:08 - to be approximately constant, it's not going
to change a whole lot on a tiny little sub
78:14 - interval. As usual, let's pick a sample point
exabyte star in the eye sub interval for each
78:20 - little sub interval. exabytes star could be
the left endpoint of the sub interval, the
78:26 - right endpoint or any point in the middle.
Now, on the AI sub interval, the force is
78:35 - approximately constant is approximately equal
to f at EXA biostar. Therefore, the work on
78:42 - that I sub interval is approximately equal
to this constant f x sub i star times the
78:52 - distance that the particle is going on that
sub interval, that that distance is just the
78:59 - length of the sub interval delta x. Instead
of thinking of the big picture of the particle
79:05 - going all the way from A to B, I'm thinking
of it going just along the first sub interval
79:09 - with the approximately constant force at a
distance of delta x. And then it's going to
79:14 - go the second sub interval, again, the forces
approximately constant times the distance
79:19 - of delta x. And then we'll do some more work
getting along the third sub interval, another
79:31 - proximately, constant force times delta x.
And so on each little tiny bit of the way,
79:39 - I'll get another little chunk of work. And
then I can get the entire amount of work by
79:46 - adding all those little chunks of work up.
So the total work done is going to be the
80:00 - sum from i equals one to n, where n is the
number of sub intervals of the work done on
80:15 - each sub interval, which is f of x sub i star
times distance delta x. I should say this
80:25 - is approximately the total work, in order
to get the actual total work, we'll need to
80:40 - take a limit as we use more and more skinnier
and skinnier subintervals. So the limit as
80:52 - n goes to infinity of this Riemann sum, the
limit of a Riemann sum is an integral. So
81:03 - we've got the integral of the force f of x,
dx, and we'll integrate between the minimum
81:08 - x value of a and the maximum x value of b.
And that's our formula for work.
81:16 - Now that we familiarize ourselves with units
a bit, let's do some examples. As our first
81:27 - example, how much work is done to lift a two
pound book off the floor onto a shelf that's
81:39 - five feet high? Well, we know that work is
force times distance, and two pounds is already
81:48 - a unit of force. And distance is five feet.
So the work done is 10 foot pounds. Now let's
82:00 - do the same problem in metric units. The two
pound book is actually a naught point nine
82:10 - kilogram book, and we're lifting it off the
floor onto a shelf that's about 1.5 meters
82:18 - high. Well, work is still force times distance.
But now the force is point nine kilograms
82:25 - times the acceleration due to gravity 9.8
meters per second squared, times our distance
82:31 - of 1.5 meters. That gives us a product of
13.23 kilograms meters squared per second
82:37 - squared, or in other words, 13.23 jewels.
In the previous two examples, force was constant,
82:45 - so we could just multiply force by distance
to get work. Now let's consider the case where
82:56 - force is not constant. Let's say a particle
moves along the x axis from a point x equals
83:06 - a to a point x equals b. According to a force,
F of x, that's a function of x and varies
83:15 - with x. How much work is done in moving a
particle although the force is not constant,
83:21 - on the whole interval from a to b, if we divide
up that interval, into a bunch of little sub
83:31 - intervals, each of width delta x, then on
any particular sub interval The force is going
83:38 - to be approximately constant, it's not going
to change a whole lot on a tiny little sub
83:41 - interval. As usual, let's pick a sample point
exabyte star in the eye sub interval for each
83:45 - little sub interval. exabytes star could be
the left endpoint of the sub interval, the
83:50 - right endpoint or any point in the middle.
Now, on the AI sub interval, the force is
83:59 - approximately constant is approximately equal
to f at EXA biostar. Therefore, the work on
84:03 - that I sub interval is approximately equal
to this constant f x sub i star times the
84:10 - distance that the particle is going on that
sub interval, that that distance is just the
84:15 - length of the sub interval delta x. Instead
of thinking of the big picture of the particle
84:22 - going all the way from A to B, I'm thinking
of it going just along the first sub interval
84:29 - with the approximately constant force at a
distance of delta x. And then it's going to
84:41 - go the second sub interval, again, the forces
approximately constant times the distance
84:46 - of delta x. And then we'll do some more work
getting along the third sub interval, another
84:52 - proximately, constant force times delta x.
And so on each little tiny bit of the way,
84:57 - I'll get another little chunk of work. And
then I can get the entire amount of work by
85:07 - adding all those little chunks of work up.
So the total work done is going to be the
85:16 - sum from i equals one to n, where n is the
number of sub intervals of the work done on
85:35 - each sub interval, which is f of x sub i star
times distance delta x. I should say this
85:42 - is approximately the total work, in order
to get the actual total work, we'll need to
85:48 - take a limit as we use more and more skinnier
and skinnier subintervals. So the limit as
85:57 - n goes to infinity of this Riemann sum, the
limit of a Riemann sum is an integral. So
85:59 - we've got the integral of the force f of x,
dx, and we'll integrate between the minimum
86:02 - x value of a and the maximum x value of b.
And that's our formula for work.
86:08 - Let's look at a physical example. How much
work is required to lift 1000 kilograms satellite
86:13 - from the Earth's surface to an altitude of
two times 10 to the six meters above the Earth's
86:20 - surface. We're given that the gravitational
force is F equals g times capital M times
86:25 - lowercase m divided by r squared, where m
is the mass of the Earth, lowercase m is the
86:30 - mass of the satellite, r is the distance between
the satellite and the center of the earth,
86:39 - and g is the gravitational constant. We're
also given numbers for the radius of the Earth,
86:46 - the mass of the Earth, and the gravitational
constant. This problem is different from the
86:53 - problem of lifting the calculus book. When
we lifted a book over just a few meters, the
87:00 - force of gravity was essentially constant
over such a small distance. So we could use
87:05 - the equation work equals force times distance.
But in this problem, since we're moving the
87:10 - satellite a larger distance, the force of
gravity changes with distance. And so we need
87:17 - to use work as the integral of this force
with respect to distance. The distance variable
87:26 - in this problem is R. So I'll rewrite this
using the equation for force and integrate
87:32 - with respect to Dr.
87:33 - Let's look at a physical example. How much
work is required to lift 1000 kilograms satellite
87:39 - from the Earth's surface to an altitude of
two times 10 to the six meters above the Earth's
87:49 - surface. We're given that the gravitational
force is F equals g times capital M times
87:57 - lowercase m divided by r squared, where m
is the mass of the Earth, lowercase m is the
88:08 - mass of the satellite, r is the distance between
the satellite and the center of the earth,
88:17 - and g is the gravitational constant. We're
also given numbers for the radius of the Earth,
88:24 - the mass of the Earth, and the gravitational
constant. This problem is different from the
88:30 - problem of lifting the calculus book. When
we lifted a book over just a few meters, the
88:41 - force of gravity was essentially constant
over such a small distance. So we could use
88:56 - the equation work equals force times distance.
But in this problem, since we're moving the
89:05 - satellite a larger distance, the force of
gravity changes with distance. And so we need
89:11 - to use work as the integral of this force
with respect to distance. The distance variable
89:18 - in this problem is R. So I'll rewrite this
using the equation for force and integrate
89:25 - with respect to Dr.
89:27 - I'm starting at the Earth's surface. So that's
a distance of 6.4 times 10 to the six meters
89:35 - from the center of the earth, since that's
the earth radius. And I'm ending at a height
89:42 - of two times 10 to the six meters above the
Earth's surface. So that's a distance r of
89:54 - 6.4 plus two, or 8.4 times 10 to the six meters
from the earth center. My only variable for
90:00 - this integral is R. So let me pull out the
constants. And I'll rewrite the one over r
90:08 - squared as r to the minus two. Now I can integrate
an R to the minus two becomes r to the minus
90:17 - one over minus one Rewrite one more time and
substitute in for R to get a preliminary answer
90:29 - of negative GE, capital M lowercase n times
negative 3.72024 times 10 to the minus eight.
90:37 - Now I still need to plug in for capital G,
capital M and lowercase m, my negatives cancel
90:44 - here. And I have G is 6.67 times 10 to the
minus 11. capital M, the mass of the Earth
90:52 - is six times 10 to the 24, and lowercase and
the mass the satellite was 1000 kilograms.
91:01 - Multiplying all these numbers together, gives
us a final answer of approximately 1.5 times
91:06 - 10 to the 10th. jewels. To put this number
in perspective, this is about the same amount
91:11 - of work done by a car in a year, or by the
human heart beating for about 400 years. In
91:19 - this video, we saw that for a constant force
work is just equal to the force times distance.
91:25 - But for a variable force work is equal to
the integral of force with respect to distance.
91:28 - This video introduces the idea of an average
value of a function. To take the average of
91:34 - a finite list of numbers, we just add the
numbers up and divide by n, the number of
91:39 - numbers. In summation notation, we write the
sum from i equals one to n of Q i all divided
91:46 - by n. But defining the average value of a
continuous function is a little different.
91:53 - Because a function can take on infinitely
many values on an interval from a to be, we
92:02 - could estimate the average value of the function
by sampling it at a finite Li many evenly
92:15 - spaced x values. I'll call them x one through
x n. And let's assume that they're spaced
92:23 - a distance of delta x apart, then the average
value of f at these sample points is just
92:30 - the sum of the values of f divided by n, the
number of values are in summation notation,
92:34 - the sum from i equals one to n of f of x i
all divided by n. This is an approximate average
92:44 - value of f, since we're just using n sample
points. But the approximation gets better
92:49 - as the number of sample points n gets bigger
and bigger. So we could define the average
92:53 - as the limit as n goes to infinity of the
sample average. I'd like to make this look
93:00 - more like a Riemann sum. So I need to get
delta x in there. So I'm just going to multiply
93:06 - the top and the bottom by delta x. And notice
that n times delta x is just the length of
93:14 - the interval b minus a. Now as the number
of sample points goes to infinity, delta x,
93:19 - the distance between them goes to zero. So
I can rewrite my limit as the limit as delta
93:26 - x goes to zero of the sum of FX II times delta
x divided by b minus a. Now the limit of this
93:33 - Riemann sum in the numerator is just the integral
from a to b of f of x dx. And so the average
93:46 - value of the function is given by the integral
on the interval from a to b divided by the
93:59 - length of the interval.
94:03 - I'm starting at the Earth's surface. So that's
a distance of 6.4 times 10 to the six meters
94:09 - from the center of the earth, since that's
the earth radius. And I'm ending at a height
94:19 - of two times 10 to the six meters above the
Earth's surface. So that's a distance r of
94:28 - 6.4 plus two, or 8.4 times 10 to the six meters
from the earth center. My only variable for
94:36 - this integral is R. So let me pull out the
constants. And I'll rewrite the one over r
94:50 - squared as r to the minus two. Now I can integrate
an R to the minus two becomes r to the minus
95:11 - one over minus one Rewrite one more time and
substitute in for R to get a preliminary answer
95:19 - of negative GE, capital M lowercase n times
negative 3.72024 times 10 to the minus eight.
95:29 - Now I still need to plug in for capital G,
capital M and lowercase m, my negatives cancel
95:46 - here. And I have G is 6.67 times 10 to the
minus 11. capital M, the mass of the Earth
95:55 - is six times 10 to the 24, and lowercase and
the mass the satellite was 1000 kilograms.
96:02 - Multiplying all these numbers together, gives
us a final answer of approximately 1.5 times
96:08 - 10 to the 10th. jewels. To put this number
in perspective, this is about the same amount
96:13 - of work done by a car in a year, or by the
human heart beating for about 400 years. In
96:22 - this video, we saw that for a constant force
work is just equal to the force times distance.
96:29 - But for a variable force work is equal to
the integral of force with respect to distance.
96:36 - This video introduces the idea of an average
value of a function. To take the average of
96:41 - a finite list of numbers, we just add the
numbers up and divide by n, the number of
96:47 - numbers. In summation notation, we write the
sum from i equals one to n of Q i all divided
96:53 - by n. But defining the average value of a
continuous function is a little different.
96:59 - Because a function can take on infinitely
many values on an interval from a to be, we
97:07 - could estimate the average value of the function
by sampling it at a finite Li many evenly
97:15 - spaced x values. I'll call them x one through
x n. And let's assume that they're spaced
97:20 - a distance of delta x apart, then the average
value of f at these sample points is just
97:27 - the sum of the values of f divided by n, the
number of values are in summation notation,
97:34 - the sum from i equals one to n of f of x i
all divided by n. This is an approximate average
97:49 - value of f, since we're just using n sample
points. But the approximation gets better
97:56 - as the number of sample points n gets bigger
and bigger. So we could define the average
98:01 - as the limit as n goes to infinity of the
sample average. I'd like to make this look
98:07 - more like a Riemann sum. So I need to get
delta x in there. So I'm just going to multiply
98:15 - the top and the bottom by delta x. And notice
that n times delta x is just the length of
98:18 - the interval b minus a. Now as the number
of sample points goes to infinity, delta x,
98:26 - the distance between them goes to zero. So
I can rewrite my limit as the limit as delta
98:31 - x goes to zero of the sum of FX II times delta
x divided by b minus a. Now the limit of this
98:45 - Riemann sum in the numerator is just the integral
from a to b of f of x dx. And so the average
98:57 - value of the function is given by the integral
on the interval from a to b divided by the
99:10 - length of the interval.
99:16 - Notice the similarity between the formula
for the average value of a function and the
99:24 - formula for the average value of a list of
numbers, the integral for the function corresponds
99:37 - to the summation sign for the list of numbers.
And the length of the interval B minus A for
99:46 - the function corresponds to n, the number
of numbers in the list of numbers. Now let's
99:52 - work an example. For the function g of x equals
one over one minus 5x. On the interval from
100:01 - two to five. We know that the average value
of G is given by the integral from two to
100:10 - five of one over one minus 5x dx divided by
the length of that interval. I'm going to
100:19 - use use of the tuition to integrate. So I'm
going to set u equal to one minus 5x. So d
100:26 - u is negative five dx. In other words, dx
is negative 1/5 times do. Looking at my bounds
100:32 - of integration, when x is equal to two, u
is equal to one minus five times two, which
100:39 - is negative nine. And when x is equal to five,
u is equal to negative 24. substituting into
100:45 - my integral, I get the integral from negative
nine to negative 24 of one over u times negative
100:51 - 1/5. Do and that's divided by three. Now dividing
by three is same as multiplying by 1/3. And
100:58 - as I integrate, I'm going to pull the negative
1/5 out, and then take the integral of one
101:07 - over u, that's ln of the absolute value of
u, evaluated in between negative 24 and negative
101:14 - nine. The absolute value signs are important
here, because they prevent me from trying
101:22 - to take the natural log of negative numbers.
To evaluate, I get negative 1/15 times ln
101:29 - of 24 minus ln of nine, I can use my log rules
to simplify and get negative 1/15 ln of 24
101:37 - over nine, that's negative 1/15 ln of eight
thirds, and as a decimal, that's approximately
101:45 - negative 0.0654. So I found the average value
of G. Now my next question is, does g ever
101:54 - achieve that average value, in other words,
is there a number c in the interval from two
102:03 - to five for which GFC equals its average value?
Well, one way to find out is just to set GSC
102:11 - equal to GS average value. In other words,
set one over one minus five c equal to negative
102:23 - 1/15 ln of eight thirds, and try to solve
for C. There are lots of ways to solve this
102:33 - equation. But I'm going to take the reciprocal
of both sides, subtract one from both sides
102:42 - and divide by negative five. This simplifies
to three over ln of eight thirds, plus 1/5.
102:48 - What which is approximately 3.25. And that
x value does lie inside the interval from
102:54 - two to five. So we've demonstrated that g
does achieve its average value over the interval.
103:00 - But in fact, we could have predicted this
to be true. Gs average value has to lie somewhere
103:06 - between GS minimum value and maximum value
on this interval. And since G is continuous
103:10 - on the interval from two to five, it has to
achieve every value that lies in between as
103:18 - minimum and maximum, including its average
value. The same argument shows that for any
103:27 - continuous function, the function must achieve
its average value on an interval. And this
103:31 - is known as the mean value theorem for integrals.
Namely, for any continuous function f of x
103:37 - on an interval from a to b, there has to be
at least one number c, between A and B, such
103:46 - that f of c equals its average value, or,
in symbols, f of c equals the integral from
103:55 - a to b of f of x dx divided by b minus a.
This video gave the definition of an average
104:05 - value of a function, and stated the mean value
theorem for integrals. If we rewrite the formula
104:15 - for average value a little, then we can see
a geometric interpretation for average value.
104:19 - The area of the box with height the average
value
104:22 - Notice the similarity between the formula
for the average value of a function and the
104:30 - formula for the average value of a list of
numbers, the integral for the function corresponds
104:40 - to the summation sign for the list of numbers.
And the length of the interval B minus A for
104:48 - the function corresponds to n, the number
of numbers in the list of numbers. Now let's
104:54 - work an example. For the function g of x equals
one over one minus 5x. On the interval from
104:59 - two to five. We know that the average value
of G is given by the integral from two to
105:09 - five of one over one minus 5x dx divided by
the length of that interval. I'm going to
105:15 - use use of the tuition to integrate. So I'm
going to set u equal to one minus 5x. So d
105:24 - u is negative five dx. In other words, dx
is negative 1/5 times do. Looking at my bounds
105:31 - of integration, when x is equal to two, u
is equal to one minus five times two, which
105:37 - is negative nine. And when x is equal to five,
u is equal to negative 24. substituting into
105:44 - my integral, I get the integral from negative
nine to negative 24 of one over u times negative
105:51 - 1/5. Do and that's divided by three. Now dividing
by three is same as multiplying by 1/3. And
106:01 - as I integrate, I'm going to pull the negative
1/5 out, and then take the integral of one
106:10 - over u, that's ln of the absolute value of
u, evaluated in between negative 24 and negative
106:17 - nine. The absolute value signs are important
here, because they prevent me from trying
106:22 - to take the natural log of negative numbers.
To evaluate, I get negative 1/15 times ln
106:33 - of 24 minus ln of nine, I can use my log rules
to simplify and get negative 1/15 ln of 24
106:47 - over nine, that's negative 1/15 ln of eight
thirds, and as a decimal, that's approximately
106:53 - negative 0.0654. So I found the average value
of G. Now my next question is, does g ever
107:03 - achieve that average value, in other words,
is there a number c in the interval from two
107:09 - to five for which GFC equals its average value?
Well, one way to find out is just to set GSC
107:16 - equal to GS average value. In other words,
set one over one minus five c equal to negative
107:25 - 1/15 ln of eight thirds, and try to solve
for C. There are lots of ways to solve this
107:37 - equation. But I'm going to take the reciprocal
of both sides, subtract one from both sides
107:46 - and divide by negative five. This simplifies
to three over ln of eight thirds, plus 1/5.
107:52 - What which is approximately 3.25. And that
x value does lie inside the interval from
107:57 - two to five. So we've demonstrated that g
does achieve its average value over the interval.
108:03 - But in fact, we could have predicted this
to be true. Gs average value has to lie somewhere
108:10 - between GS minimum value and maximum value
on this interval. And since G is continuous
108:17 - on the interval from two to five, it has to
achieve every value that lies in between as
108:28 - minimum and maximum, including its average
value. The same argument shows that for any
108:33 - continuous function, the function must achieve
its average value on an interval. And this
108:36 - is known as the mean value theorem for integrals.
Namely, for any continuous function f of x
108:42 - on an interval from a to b, there has to be
at least one number c, between A and B, such
108:48 - that f of c equals its average value, or,
in symbols, f of c equals the integral from
108:58 - a to b of f of x dx divided by b minus a.
This video gave the definition of an average
109:09 - value of a function, and stated the mean value
theorem for integrals. If we rewrite the formula
109:21 - for average value a little, then we can see
a geometric interpretation for average value.
109:34 - The area of the box with height the average
value
109:40 - is the same as the area under the curve. This
video gives two proofs of the mean value theorem
109:49 - for integrals. the mean value theorem for
integrals says the for continuous function
109:53 - f of x, defined on an interval from a to b,
there's some number c between A and B, such
110:06 - that f of c is equal to the average value
of f. The first proof that I'm going to give
110:15 - us is the intermediate value theorem. Recall
that the intermediate value theorem says that
110:20 - if we have a continuous function f defined
on an interval, which I'll call x 1x, two.
110:27 - If we have some number l in between f of x
one and f of x two, then f has to achieve
110:36 - the value l somewhere between x one and x
two Keeping in mind the intermediate value
110:45 - theorem, let's turn our attention back to
the mean value theorem for integrals. Now,
110:53 - it's possible that our function f of x might
be constant on the interval from a to b. But
111:02 - if that's true, then our mean value theorem
for integrals holds easily. Because f AF is
111:05 - just equal to that constant, which is equal
to f of c for any c between A and B. So let's
111:15 - assume that f is not constant. Well, like
continuous function on a closed interval has
111:19 - to have a minimum value and a maximum value,
which I'll call little m, and big M. Now,
111:25 - we know that F's average value on the interval
has to be between its maximum value and its
111:32 - minimum value. If you don't believe this,
consider the fact that all of us values on
111:40 - the interval have to lie between big M and
little m. And if we integrate this inequality,
111:51 - we get little m times b minus a is less than
or equal to the integral of f is less than
112:02 - or equal to big M times b minus a. Notice
that the first and the last integrals, were
112:12 - just integrating a constant. Now if I divide
all three sides by b minus a, I can see that
112:21 - little m is less than or equal to the average
value of f is less than or equal to big M
112:34 - as I wanted. Now, I just need to apply the
intermediate value theorem with F average
112:44 - as my number L and little m and big M as my
values of f of x one and f of x two. The intermediate
112:58 - value theorem says that F average is achieved
by f of c for some C in between my x one and
113:08 - x two. And therefore, for some C in my interval
a b. And that proves the mean value theorem
113:17 - for integrals. Now I'm going to give a second
proof for the mean value theorem for integrals.
113:24 - And this time, it's going to be as a corollary
to the regular mean value theorem for functions.
113:32 - Recall that the mean value theorem for functions,
says that if g of x is continuous on a closed
113:38 - interval, and differentiable on the interior
of that interval, then there's some number
113:44 - c in the interval, such that the derivative
of g at C is equal to the average rate of
113:51 - change of G, across the whole interval from
a to b. Let's keep the mean value theorem
113:59 - for functions in mind, and turn our attention
back to the mean value theorem for integrals.
114:06 - I'm going to define a function g of x to be
the integral from a to x of f of t dt, where
114:13 - F is the function given to us in the statement
of the mean value theorem for integrals. Notice
114:19 - that g of A is just the integral from a to
a, which is zero. Well, g of B is the integral
114:28 - from a to b of our function. Now, by the fundamental
theorem of calculus, our function g of x is
114:37 - continuous and differentiable on the interval
a, b, and g prime of x is equal to f of x.
114:44 - is the same as the area under the curve. This
video gives two proofs of the mean value theorem
114:52 - for integrals. the mean value theorem for
integrals says the for continuous function
114:57 - f of x, defined on an interval from a to b,
there's some number c between A and B, such
115:08 - that f of c is equal to the average value
of f. The first proof that I'm going to give
115:20 - us is the intermediate value theorem. Recall
that the intermediate value theorem says that
115:25 - if we have a continuous function f defined
on an interval, which I'll call x 1x, two.
115:31 - If we have some number l in between f of x
one and f of x two, then f has to achieve
115:48 - the value l somewhere between x one and x
two Keeping in mind the intermediate value
115:56 - theorem, let's turn our attention back to
the mean value theorem for integrals. Now,
116:01 - it's possible that our function f of x might
be constant on the interval from a to b. But
116:06 - if that's true, then our mean value theorem
for integrals holds easily. Because f AF is
116:12 - just equal to that constant, which is equal
to f of c for any c between A and B. So let's
116:21 - assume that f is not constant. Well, like
continuous function on a closed interval has
116:26 - to have a minimum value and a maximum value,
which I'll call little m, and big M. Now,
116:36 - we know that F's average value on the interval
has to be between its maximum value and its
116:42 - minimum value. If you don't believe this,
consider the fact that all of us values on
116:48 - the interval have to lie between big M and
little m. And if we integrate this inequality,
116:49 - we get little m times b minus a is less than
or equal to the integral of f is less than
116:58 - or equal to big M times b minus a. Notice
that the first and the last integrals, were
117:03 - just integrating a constant. Now if I divide
all three sides by b minus a, I can see that
117:07 - little m is less than or equal to the average
value of f is less than or equal to big M
117:16 - as I wanted. Now, I just need to apply the
intermediate value theorem with F average
117:22 - as my number L and little m and big M as my
values of f of x one and f of x two. The intermediate
117:34 - value theorem says that F average is achieved
by f of c for some C in between my x one and
117:45 - x two. And therefore, for some C in my interval
a b. And that proves the mean value theorem
117:53 - for integrals. Now I'm going to give a second
proof for the mean value theorem for integrals.
118:02 - And this time, it's going to be as a corollary
to the regular mean value theorem for functions.
118:12 - Recall that the mean value theorem for functions,
says that if g of x is continuous on a closed
118:21 - interval, and differentiable on the interior
of that interval, then there's some number
118:28 - c in the interval, such that the derivative
of g at C is equal to the average rate of
118:38 - change of G, across the whole interval from
a to b. Let's keep the mean value theorem
118:46 - for functions in mind, and turn our attention
back to the mean value theorem for integrals.
118:54 - I'm going to define a function g of x to be
the integral from a to x of f of t dt, where
119:05 - F is the function given to us in the statement
of the mean value theorem for integrals. Notice
119:14 - that g of A is just the integral from a to
a, which is zero. Well, g of B is the integral
119:25 - from a to b of our function. Now, by the fundamental
theorem of calculus, our function g of x is
119:35 - continuous and differentiable on the interval
a, b, and g prime of x is equal to f of x.
119:43 - And by the mean value theorem for functions,
we know that g prime of c has to equal g of
119:47 - b minus g of a over b minus a, for some number
c and the interval a b, if we substitute in
119:56 - the three facts above, into our equation below,
we get f of c is equal to the integral from
120:06 - a to b of f of t dt minus zero over b minus
a, which is exactly the conclusion that we
120:19 - wanted to reach. This shows that the mean
value theorem for integrals really is the
120:24 - mean value theorem for functions where our
function is an integral. And this completes
120:29 - the second proof of the mean value theorem
for integrals. So now I've proved the mean
120:37 - value theorem for integrals in two different
ways. And I've used a lot of the great theorems
120:42 - of calculus along the way. In this video,
we'll learn a technique of integration called
120:46 - inner By parts. integration by parts is based
on the product rule for taking derivatives.
120:53 - Recall that the product rule says that when
you take the derivative of a product of two
120:58 - functions, that's equal to the derivative
of the first function times the second function,
121:02 - plus the first function times the derivative
of the second function. If we rearrange this
121:07 - formula, by solving for this last term, we
get f of x times g prime of x is equal to
121:13 - f of x g of x prime minus f prime of x g of
x. Now let's integrate both sides of this
121:27 - equation with respect to x. The integral of
a difference is the difference of the integrals.
121:34 - So I can break up this right hand side into
two integrals. Now the integral of the derivative
121:41 - of f times g is just equal to f times g, by
the fundamental theorem of calculus. And I
121:48 - carry the rest of the formula down. And now
I have a formula relating the integral of
121:55 - f times g prime to the integral of f prime
times G. This formula allows us to rewrite
122:03 - something that might be tricky to integrate,
in terms of something that's hopefully easier
122:09 - to integrate. Although I've written this formula,
using indefinite integrals with no bounds
122:15 - of integration, it would be just as easy to
put on bounds of integration. Now, the fundamental
122:23 - theorem tells us that the integral of the
derivative is the original product of functions
122:30 - evaluated from A to B. There's another version
of this formula that might be a little easier
122:39 - to remember. If we let u equal f of x, and
v equal g of x, then do is equal to f prime
122:51 - of x dx using differential notation, and dv
is equal to g prime of x dx. In this notation,
122:59 - we can rewrite the formula as the integral
of u times dv is equal to u times v minus
123:04 - the integral of v, d U. since V is our G of
X, and D, u is our f prime of x dx. Again,
123:11 - we can include bounds of integration, if we're
working with definite integrals. This will
123:16 - be our key formula for this section. and integrating
using this formula is called integration by
123:19 - parts. Let's use integration by parts to find
the integral of x e to the x dx. Or for formula
123:30 - for integration by parts, says the integral
of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral
123:36 - of the do. So we need to split up our inner
grand x e to the x dx into the part that we're
123:46 - going to call you, and a part that we're going
to call dv. One natural way to split it up
123:54 - is to let u equal x and dv equal e to the
x dx. But another option might be to make
124:05 - u equal to e to the x and dv equal to x dx
bar, we might decide to make you be the whole
124:13 - product, x e to the x and leave dv as just
dx.
124:16 - And by the mean value theorem for functions,
we know that g prime of c has to equal g of
124:19 - b minus g of a over b minus a, for some number
c and the interval a b, if we substitute in
124:29 - the three facts above, into our equation below,
we get f of c is equal to the integral from
124:36 - a to b of f of t dt minus zero over b minus
a, which is exactly the conclusion that we
124:42 - wanted to reach. This shows that the mean
value theorem for integrals really is the
124:47 - mean value theorem for functions where our
function is an integral. And this completes
124:50 - the second proof of the mean value theorem
for integrals. So now I've proved the mean
124:56 - value theorem for integrals in two different
ways. And I've used a lot of the great theorems
125:03 - of calculus along the way. In this video,
we'll learn a technique of integration called
125:13 - inner By parts. integration by parts is based
on the product rule for taking derivatives.
125:22 - Recall that the product rule says that when
you take the derivative of a product of two
125:30 - functions, that's equal to the derivative
of the first function times the second function,
125:37 - plus the first function times the derivative
of the second function. If we rearrange this
125:44 - formula, by solving for this last term, we
get f of x times g prime of x is equal to
125:53 - f of x g of x prime minus f prime of x g of
x. Now let's integrate both sides of this
126:06 - equation with respect to x. The integral of
a difference is the difference of the integrals.
126:16 - So I can break up this right hand side into
two integrals. Now the integral of the derivative
126:24 - of f times g is just equal to f times g, by
the fundamental theorem of calculus. And I
126:32 - carry the rest of the formula down. And now
I have a formula relating the integral of
126:41 - f times g prime to the integral of f prime
times G. This formula allows us to rewrite
126:47 - something that might be tricky to integrate,
in terms of something that's hopefully easier
126:51 - to integrate. Although I've written this formula,
using indefinite integrals with no bounds
126:57 - of integration, it would be just as easy to
put on bounds of integration. Now, the fundamental
127:08 - theorem tells us that the integral of the
derivative is the original product of functions
127:15 - evaluated from A to B. There's another version
of this formula that might be a little easier
127:17 - to remember. If we let u equal f of x, and
v equal g of x, then do is equal to f prime
127:25 - of x dx using differential notation, and dv
is equal to g prime of x dx. In this notation,
127:34 - we can rewrite the formula as the integral
of u times dv is equal to u times v minus
127:46 - the integral of v, d U. since V is our G of
X, and D, u is our f prime of x dx. Again,
128:00 - we can include bounds of integration, if we're
working with definite integrals. This will
128:05 - be our key formula for this section. and integrating
using this formula is called integration by
128:13 - parts. Let's use integration by parts to find
the integral of x e to the x dx. Or for formula
128:24 - for integration by parts, says the integral
of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral
128:36 - of the do. So we need to split up our inner
grand x e to the x dx into the part that we're
128:43 - going to call you, and a part that we're going
to call dv. One natural way to split it up
128:54 - is to let u equal x and dv equal e to the
x dx. But another option might be to make
129:02 - u equal to e to the x and dv equal to x dx
bar, we might decide to make you be the whole
129:11 - product, x e to the x and leave dv as just
dx.
129:14 - Whatever choice we make, we need a u times
dv to be our entire integrand here, and we
129:18 - need dx to be part of dv in order to use proper
differential notation. Let's try using the
129:25 - first choice first. If u is equal to x, then
d u is equal to dx. And if dv is e to the
129:33 - x dx, then we can find V by integrating this
and the integral of e to the x dx is e to
129:40 - the x. plugging into our integration by parts
formula, we have the integral of u dv that's
129:54 - x, e to the x dx is equal to u times v x into
dx minus the integral of vdu. That's e to
130:11 - the x dx. Well, this is looking very promising,
because I know how to integrate e to the x
130:19 - dx. It's just e to the x plus a constant of
integration. And so integration by part has
130:24 - allowed us to compute our integral, let's
check our answer by taking the derivative
130:30 - of what we got the derivative of x, e to the
x minus e to the x plus C is going to be the
130:39 - derivative of x, that's one, times e to the
x plus x times the derivative of e to the
130:53 - x, which is dx, minus the derivative of iliacs,
which is again, the x plus the derivative
131:01 - of C, which is just zero. And since this term
and this term cancel out, we're left with
131:10 - x e to the x, which is exactly what we started
out with as our integrand. So we've checked
131:17 - that our work is correct. Notice that in order
to take the derivative of our answer, we ended
131:26 - up having to use the product rule. And that's
no coincidence, because the formula for integration
131:33 - by parts is really just the product rule used
in reverse. So we were successful in computing
131:41 - this integral using our first choice of u
and dv. But before we leave this problem,
131:46 - let's see what would have happened if we used
a different choice. Instead, if we used you've
131:54 - equal to either the X and dv equal to x dx,
if we done that, then we would have gotten
132:01 - do to be either the x dx, and we would have
computed V by integrating x dx two that get
132:12 - x squared over two. plugging this into our
formula for integration by parts, we would
132:17 - get the integral of udv, that's e to the x
times x dx is equal to u times v, that's e
132:23 - to the x times x squared over two, minus the
integral of vdu. That's x squared over two
132:26 - times e to the x, dx. Now in order to go any
further, we need to be able to compute the
132:35 - integral of x squared over two times e to
the x dx. dividing by two poses no problem,
132:44 - that's just a constant, but the integral of
x squared e to the x that's more complicated
132:48 - than the integral of e to the x times x that
we started with. So we're going the wrong
132:54 - direction here. And this turns out to be a
poor choice of u and dv. I'll let you check
132:58 - that the third choice of u and dv that I suggested
also ends up making things more complicated
133:07 - instead of simpler. So the first choice turned
out to be the best choice for you, and dv.
133:14 - integration by parts works by replacing an
integral of the form u dv by the equivalent
133:19 - expression, u times v minus the integral of
vdu. That's hopefully easier to compute. There
133:24 - are a lot of trig identities that come in
handy when you're doing calculus. But the
133:29 - good news is, if you're willing to do a little
bit of algebra, there are only a few that
133:39 - you really have to memorize. In this video,
I'll tell you my three favorite trig identities,
133:45 - and show you how to derive a bunch more with
very little effort from these three. So I'm
133:51 - going to tell you the three trig identities
that I think everybody should know. Fortunately,
133:54 - all three of them are very easy to remember.
The first one is the Pythagorean identity.
134:01 - That's the identity that says sine squared
of theta plus cosine squared of theta is equal
134:10 - to one. That one's easy to remember, because
it's really just the Pythagorean theorem for
134:16 - triangles in the context of the unit circle.
134:20 - Whatever choice we make, we need a u times
dv to be our entire integrand here, and we
134:28 - need dx to be part of dv in order to use proper
differential notation. Let's try using the
134:34 - first choice first. If u is equal to x, then
d u is equal to dx. And if dv is e to the
134:46 - x dx, then we can find V by integrating this
and the integral of e to the x dx is e to
134:55 - the x. plugging into our integration by parts
formula, we have the integral of u dv that's
135:01 - x, e to the x dx is equal to u times v x into
dx minus the integral of vdu. That's e to
135:09 - the x dx. Well, this is looking very promising,
because I know how to integrate e to the x
135:17 - dx. It's just e to the x plus a constant of
integration. And so integration by part has
135:22 - allowed us to compute our integral, let's
check our answer by taking the derivative
135:27 - of what we got the derivative of x, e to the
x minus e to the x plus C is going to be the
135:36 - derivative of x, that's one, times e to the
x plus x times the derivative of e to the
135:40 - x, which is dx, minus the derivative of iliacs,
which is again, the x plus the derivative
135:46 - of C, which is just zero. And since this term
and this term cancel out, we're left with
135:53 - x e to the x, which is exactly what we started
out with as our integrand. So we've checked
135:58 - that our work is correct. Notice that in order
to take the derivative of our answer, we ended
136:03 - up having to use the product rule. And that's
no coincidence, because the formula for integration
136:09 - by parts is really just the product rule used
in reverse. So we were successful in computing
136:12 - this integral using our first choice of u
and dv. But before we leave this problem,
136:16 - let's see what would have happened if we used
a different choice. Instead, if we used you've
136:25 - equal to either the X and dv equal to x dx,
if we done that, then we would have gotten
136:30 - do to be either the x dx, and we would have

136:36 - x squared over two. plugging this into our
formula for integration by parts, we would
136:41 - get the integral of udv, that's e to the x
times x dx is equal to u times v, that's e
136:50 - to the x times x squared over two, minus the
integral of vdu. That's x squared over two
136:56 - times e to the x, dx. Now in order to go any
further, we need to be able to compute the
137:04 - integral of x squared over two times e to
the x dx. dividing by two poses no problem,
137:10 - that's just a constant, but the integral of
x squared e to the x that's more complicated
137:17 - than the integral of e to the x times x that
we started with. So we're going the wrong

also ends up making things more complicated
137:40 - instead of simpler. So the first choice turned
out to be the best choice for you, and dv.
137:47 - integration by parts works by replacing an
integral of the form u dv by the equivalent
137:55 - expression, u times v minus the integral of
vdu. That's hopefully easier to compute. There
138:01 - are a lot of trig identities that come in
handy when you're doing calculus. But the
138:04 - good news is, if you're willing to do a little
bit of algebra, there are only a few that
138:10 - you really have to memorize. In this video,
I'll tell you my three favorite trig identities,
138:15 - and show you how to derive a bunch more with
very little effort from these three. So I'm
138:25 - going to tell you the three trig identities
that I think everybody should know. Fortunately,
138:29 - all three of them are very easy to remember.
The first one is the Pythagorean identity.
138:34 - That's the identity that says sine squared
of theta plus cosine squared of theta is equal
138:43 - to one. That one's easy to remember, because
it's really just the Pythagorean theorem for
138:49 - triangles in the context of the unit circle.
138:51 - If I draw a right triangle with angle theta
on a unit circle, it's hi partners has length
138:58 - one, because a unit circle means a circle
of radius one. The base of this triangle has
139:01 - length cosine of theta, because by definition,
cosine of theta is the x coordinate of the
139:05 - point on the unit circle at angle theta. Similarly,
the height of the triangle is sine of theta,
139:09 - because sine of theta means the y coordinate
on the unit circle. So by the Pythagorean
139:14 - theorem for right triangles, we know that
sine theta squared plus cosine theta squared
139:22 - equals one, which is exactly the bit beggary
and identity. The second identities that everybody
139:27 - should know are the even and odd identities.
I guess technically, these are two different
139:33 - identities but they go together, so I'm counting
them as one. The even identity says that cosine
139:39 - of negative theta is equal to cosine of Beta.
In other words, cosine is an even function.
139:46 - And the identity says that sine of negative
theta is equal to negative sine of theta.
139:52 - In other words, sine is an odd function. One
way to remember these identities is by looking
139:58 - at the graphs of sine and cosine. Y equals
cosine x has this bilateral symmetry, so it's
140:05 - an even function. And if I look at the value
of cosine at theta, and cosine at negative
140:12 - theta, my graph has the same height. So cosine
has the same value for both of these angles.
140:19 - The graph of y equals sine x does not have
bilateral symmetry, instead, it's got 180
140:26 - degree rotational symmetry, which is characteristic
of an odd function. And if I compare the y
140:31 - values, that theta and negative theta, I see
that the y value at negative theta is exactly
140:38 - the opposite as the y value at theta, and
therefore, sine of negative theta is equal
140:47 - to negative sine of theta. Another way to
understand that, even in odd identities, is
140:55 - by going back to the unit circle. If I look
at an angle of theta, compared to an angle
141:05 - of negative theta, the x coordinate, which
is cosine has the same value for both of these
141:13 - angles. So that means cosine of negative theta
is equal to cosine of theta. the y coordinate
141:21 - instead is the opposite. For negative theta,
versus theta, one of them is positive and
141:30 - one of them is negative, but they have the
same magnitude. Therefore, sine of negative
141:37 - theta is the negative of sine of theta. My
third favorite trig identity is the angle
141:40 - sum formula. Again, there are really two,
one for sine and one for cosine, but they
141:47 - go together, so I'll consider them a single
identity. These identities are easy to remember
141:52 - because there's a song that goes with them.
And the song goes, sine, cosine, cosine, sine,
141:57 - cosine, cosine, minus sign sign, you may recognize
the tune, please sing along with me this time.
142:05 - So remember it 123 go sine cosine cosine sine,
cosine cosine minus sine sine. The only thing
142:15 - you have to remember when you sing the song
is that it gives the sine of A plus B first,
142:24 - and then the cosine of A plus B. So these
are the three trig identities that I think
142:31 - everybody should memorize. Next, I'll show
you how to derive a bunch more trig identities.
142:37 - Pretty simply, from these three. I've written
my three favorite trig identities across the
142:41 - top for easy reference. First of all, we can
derive a couple of good identities just from
142:49 - the beggary and identity. Let's start by dividing
both sides of this identity by cosine squared
142:52 - theta. We can break up the fraction on the
left into sine squared theta over cosine squared
142:58 - theta plus cosine squared theta over cosine
squared theta equals one over cosine squared
143:04 - theta. But sine squared theta over cosine
squared theta is just tan squared theta. and
143:09 - cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta
is one. And one over cosine squared theta
143:14 - is seacon squared theta, since secant theta
by definition is one over cosine.
143:19 - If I draw a right triangle with angle theta
on a unit circle, it's hi partners has length
143:26 - one, because a unit circle means a circle
of radius one. The base of this triangle has
143:34 - length cosine of theta, because by definition,
cosine of theta is the x coordinate of the
143:42 - point on the unit circle at angle theta. Similarly,
the height of the triangle is sine of theta,
143:49 - because sine of theta means the y coordinate
on the unit circle. So by the Pythagorean
143:57 - theorem for right triangles, we know that
sine theta squared plus cosine theta squared
144:03 - equals one, which is exactly the bit beggary
and identity. The second identities that everybody
144:09 - should know are the even and odd identities.
I guess technically, these are two different
144:15 - identities but they go together, so I'm counting
them as one. The even identity says that cosine
144:21 - of negative theta is equal to cosine of Beta.
In other words, cosine is an even function.
144:28 - And the identity says that sine of negative
theta is equal to negative sine of theta.
144:34 - In other words, sine is an odd function. One
way to remember these identities is by looking
144:42 - at the graphs of sine and cosine. Y equals
cosine x has this bilateral symmetry, so it's
144:49 - an even function. And if I look at the value
of cosine at theta, and cosine at negative
144:54 - theta, my graph has the same height. So cosine
has the same value for both of these angles.
145:00 - The graph of y equals sine x does not have
bilateral symmetry, instead, it's got 180
145:09 - degree rotational symmetry, which is characteristic
of an odd function. And if I compare the y
145:16 - values, that theta and negative theta, I see
that the y value at negative theta is exactly
145:22 - the opposite as the y value at theta, and
therefore, sine of negative theta is equal
145:32 - to negative sine of theta. Another way to
understand that, even in odd identities, is
145:37 - by going back to the unit circle. If I look
at an angle of theta, compared to an angle
145:44 - of negative theta, the x coordinate, which
is cosine has the same value for both of these
145:50 - angles. So that means cosine of negative theta
is equal to cosine of theta. the y coordinate
145:54 - instead is the opposite. For negative theta,
versus theta, one of them is positive and
145:58 - one of them is negative, but they have the
same magnitude. Therefore, sine of negative
146:02 - theta is the negative of sine of theta. My
third favorite trig identity is the angle
146:11 - sum formula. Again, there are really two,
one for sine and one for cosine, but they
146:18 - go together, so I'll consider them a single
identity. These identities are easy to remember
146:24 - because there's a song that goes with them.
And the song goes, sine, cosine, cosine, sine,
146:31 - cosine, cosine, minus sign sign, you may recognize
the tune, please sing along with me this time.
146:37 - So remember it 123 go sine cosine cosine sine,
cosine cosine minus sine sine. The only thing
146:44 - you have to remember when you sing the song
is that it gives the sine of A plus B first,
146:52 - and then the cosine of A plus B. So these
are the three trig identities that I think
146:59 - everybody should memorize. Next, I'll show
you how to derive a bunch more trig identities.
147:03 - Pretty simply, from these three. I've written
my three favorite trig identities across the
147:09 - top for easy reference. First of all, we can
derive a couple of good identities just from
147:22 - the beggary and identity. Let's start by dividing
both sides of this identity by cosine squared
147:32 - theta. We can break up the fraction on the
left into sine squared theta over cosine squared
147:38 - theta plus cosine squared theta over cosine
squared theta equals one over cosine squared
147:43 - theta. But sine squared theta over cosine
squared theta is just tan squared theta. and
147:49 - cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta
is one. And one over cosine squared theta
147:53 - is seacon squared theta, since secant theta
by definition is one over cosine.
147:57 - So we found a new identity, a variation on
the Pythagorean identity that involves tangent
148:01 - and secant. Now, what if we wanted an identity
that involved cotangent and cosecant instead?
148:09 - Well, as you might be thinking, we could just
start with the theory and identity. And this
148:18 - time, divide both sides by sine squared of
theta. If we break up the fraction like before,
148:29 - we get one plus cotangent squared theta equals
cosecant squared theta. Since cotangent is
148:36 - cosine over sine, and cosecant is one of our
sign. Next, it's possible to get a bunch of
148:43 - great identities from the angle some formulas.
Let's start by deriving an angle difference
148:49 - formula. If we want a formula for sine of
A minus B, all we have to do is plug in negative
148:59 - B for B In our angle some formula. So we get
sine of A cosine of negative b plus cosine
149:07 - of A sine of negative B. But we know that
cosine of negative B is cosine of B, since
149:13 - cosine is 11. And sine of negative b is negative
sine of B, so that turns this positive sign
149:20 - to a negative sign. And we have an angle difference
formula for sine. Similarly, we can use the
149:28 - angle sum formula for cosine, plugging in
negative B for b. and use the even odd properties
149:34 - to get an angle difference formula for cosine.
Now let's derive a super useful formula, the
149:40 - double angle formula. If we want a formula
for sine of two theta, we can think of that
149:45 - as being the sine of theta plus theta. So
let's plug theta in for a and theta in for
149:51 - B in our angle sum formula. That gives us
sine cosine, cosine sine, which simplifies
149:56 - to two sine theta cosine theta. That's the
double angle formula for sine. That worked
150:03 - out so well, let's try the same thing for
cosine. cosine of two theta is cosine of theta
150:14 - plus theta. And using the angle sum formula,
that's cosine, cosine minus sine sine, we
150:24 - can rewrite this as cosine squared theta minus
sine squared theta, and get our first version
150:31 - of the double angle formula for cosine. But
we could also use the Pythagorean identity
150:37 - to replace cosine squared theta by one minus
sine squared theta. Or if we prefer, we can
150:45 - replace sine squared theta by one minus cosine
squared theta. If we replace cosine squared,
150:53 - we get cosine of two theta is one minus sine
squared theta minus sine squared theta. In
151:02 - other words, cosine of two theta is one minus
twice sine squared theta. And if we go back
151:09 - to the original, and replace sine squared
theta by one minus cosine squared theta, we
151:16 - get cosine of two theta is cosine squared
theta minus quantity one minus cosine squared
151:20 - theta, which simplifies to cosine of two theta
is twice cosine squared theta minus one. So
151:25 - we found one version of a double angle formula
for sine, and three versions for cosine, just
151:30 - using the angle sum formula and the Pythagorean
identity. These last two formulas are particularly
151:35 - useful for integration when they're rewritten
slightly. For this formula, let me solve for
151:40 - sine squared of theta, I get two sine squared
of theta is equal to one minus cosine of two
151:46 - theta. So sine squared of theta is one half
minus one half cosine of two theta. I'll do
151:53 - the analogous thing with this formula and
solve for cosine squared theta
151:56 - So we found a new identity, a variation on
the Pythagorean identity that involves tangent
152:02 - and secant. Now, what if we wanted an identity
that involved cotangent and cosecant instead?
152:09 - Well, as you might be thinking, we could just
start with the theory and identity. And this
152:14 - time, divide both sides by sine squared of
theta. If we break up the fraction like before,
152:20 - we get one plus cotangent squared theta equals
cosecant squared theta. Since cotangent is
152:24 - cosine over sine, and cosecant is one of our
sign. Next, it's possible to get a bunch of
152:32 - great identities from the angle some formulas.
Let's start by deriving an angle difference
152:39 - formula. If we want a formula for sine of
A minus B, all we have to do is plug in negative
152:47 - B for B In our angle some formula. So we get
sine of A cosine of negative b plus cosine
152:59 - of A sine of negative B. But we know that
cosine of negative B is cosine of B, since
153:08 - cosine is 11. And sine of negative b is negative
sine of B, so that turns this positive sign
153:14 - to a negative sign. And we have an angle difference
formula for sine. Similarly, we can use the
153:18 - angle sum formula for cosine, plugging in
negative B for b. and use the even odd properties
153:22 - to get an angle difference formula for cosine.
Now let's derive a super useful formula, the
153:30 - double angle formula. If we want a formula
for sine of two theta, we can think of that
153:35 - as being the sine of theta plus theta. So
let's plug theta in for a and theta in for
153:41 - B in our angle sum formula. That gives us
sine cosine, cosine sine, which simplifies
153:47 - to two sine theta cosine theta. That's the
double angle formula for sine. That worked
153:53 - out so well, let's try the same thing for
cosine. cosine of two theta is cosine of theta
154:01 - plus theta. And using the angle sum formula,
that's cosine, cosine minus sine sine, we
154:08 - can rewrite this as cosine squared theta minus
sine squared theta, and get our first version
154:14 - of the double angle formula for cosine. But
we could also use the Pythagorean identity
154:16 - to replace cosine squared theta by one minus
sine squared theta. Or if we prefer, we can
154:24 - replace sine squared theta by one minus cosine
squared theta. If we replace cosine squared,
154:31 - we get cosine of two theta is one minus sine
squared theta minus sine squared theta. In
154:39 - other words, cosine of two theta is one minus
twice sine squared theta. And if we go back
154:47 - to the original, and replace sine squared
theta by one minus cosine squared theta, we
154:54 - get cosine of two theta is cosine squared
theta minus quantity one minus cosine squared
155:00 - theta, which simplifies to cosine of two theta
is twice cosine squared theta minus one. So
155:08 - we found one version of a double angle formula
for sine, and three versions for cosine, just
155:17 - using the angle sum formula and the Pythagorean
identity. These last two formulas are particularly
155:23 - useful for integration when they're rewritten
slightly. For this formula, let me solve for
155:28 - sine squared of theta, I get two sine squared
of theta is equal to one minus cosine of two
155:36 - theta. So sine squared of theta is one half
minus one half cosine of two theta. I'll do
155:47 - the analogous thing with this formula and
solve for cosine squared theta
155:53 - to cosine squared theta is equal to one plus
cosine of two theta. So cosine squared theta
156:00 - is equal to one half, plus one half cosine
of two theta. That's all the triggers in these
156:07 - we're gonna need. It may seem like a lot,
but remember, they all follow very naturally
156:16 - from my three favorites at the top. Well,
all these formulas are very useful. The ones
156:24 - that are of particular importance for techniques
of integration are the first one, that factory
156:32 - and identity and its various forms. And the
last two. In this video, I told you my three
156:41 - favorite trig identities, the Pythagorean
identity, the even an odd identities and the
156:44 - angle some formulas. From these I derived
a bunch of other identities, including a handful
156:52 - that will be particularly useful as we do
techniques of integration. Remember the angle
156:57 - some formulas, those are the formulas for
computing sine of A plus B, and cosine of
157:02 - A plus B. I like to sing them, sine, cosine,
cosine, sine, cosine, cosine minus sine sine.
157:09 - This video gives a geometric proof of those
formulas. There are many great proofs of the
157:16 - angle some formulas, but I'd like to share
with you one of my favorites for those who
157:23 - are interested. Alright, the angle some formulas
up here, so we'll know what we're trying to
157:28 - prove. To prove these formulas, let me start
by drawing an angle A and angle B on top of
157:35 - that. Next, I'm going to draw a line perpendicular
to this middle line. And I'm going to extend
157:42 - the top line until it meets that perpendicular,
making a right triangle. Finally, I'll draw
157:49 - a rectangle around that right triangle that
just touches its vertices. My rectangle is
157:57 - now divided up into four right triangles.
And I'm going to choose units of measurement,
158:05 - so that the high partners of my middle triangle
has length one. Now let's stop for a minute
158:12 - to think about the angles of these other triangles.
Since the top and the bottom edge of the rectangle
158:20 - are parallel lines, and this high partners
is a transversal. This angle up here must
158:26 - have the same measure as a plus b down here.
Also, this skinny angle here must have the
158:32 - same measure as a down here. Because this
angle is 180 degrees, minus 90 degrees minus
158:37 - this angle here. And this angle A is also
180 degrees, the measure of the angles in
158:43 - a triangle minus 90 degrees minus that same
angle.
158:47 - to cosine squared theta is equal to one plus
cosine of two theta. So cosine squared theta
158:53 - is equal to one half, plus one half cosine
of two theta. That's all the triggers in these
158:57 - we're gonna need. It may seem like a lot,
but remember, they all follow very naturally
159:03 - from my three favorites at the top. Well,
all these formulas are very useful. The ones
159:07 - that are of particular importance for techniques
of integration are the first one, that factory
159:11 - and identity and its various forms. And the
last two. In this video, I told you my three
159:17 - favorite trig identities, the Pythagorean
identity, the even an odd identities and the
159:21 - angle some formulas. From these I derived
a bunch of other identities, including a handful
159:29 - that will be particularly useful as we do
techniques of integration. Remember the angle
159:34 - some formulas, those are the formulas for
computing sine of A plus B, and cosine of
159:39 - A plus B. I like to sing them, sine, cosine,
cosine, sine, cosine, cosine minus sine sine.
159:47 - This video gives a geometric proof of those
formulas. There are many great proofs of the
159:56 - angle some formulas, but I'd like to share
with you one of my favorites for those who
160:04 - are interested. Alright, the angle some formulas
up here, so we'll know what we're trying to
160:08 - prove. To prove these formulas, let me start
by drawing an angle A and angle B on top of
160:17 - that. Next, I'm going to draw a line perpendicular
to this middle line. And I'm going to extend
160:23 - the top line until it meets that perpendicular,
making a right triangle. Finally, I'll draw
160:29 - a rectangle around that right triangle that
just touches its vertices. My rectangle is
160:35 - now divided up into four right triangles.
And I'm going to choose units of measurement,
160:41 - so that the high partners of my middle triangle
has length one. Now let's stop for a minute
160:47 - to think about the angles of these other triangles.
Since the top and the bottom edge of the rectangle
160:59 - are parallel lines, and this high partners
is a transversal. This angle up here must
161:02 - have the same measure as a plus b down here.
Also, this skinny angle here must have the
161:08 - same measure as a down here. Because this
angle is 180 degrees, minus 90 degrees minus
161:12 - this angle here. And this angle A is also
180 degrees, the measure of the angles in
161:23 - a triangle minus 90 degrees minus that same
angle.
161:27 - So I'll label this skinny angle with a. Next,
let's figure out as many side lengths as we
161:36 - can.
161:37 - So I'll label this skinny angle with a. Next,
let's figure out as many side lengths as we
161:45 - can.
161:46 - Based on the middle right triangle with high
partners one, we know that this side length
161:54 - down here must be cosine of B, since adjacent
over hypotenuse is cosine B. Similarly, this
162:03 - side length here must be sine of B. Since
opposite of our hypothesis is sine of B, now
162:13 - we see that sine of B is the hypotenuse of
this right triangle, which means that this
162:18 - little side here has measure sign a time sign
B. That's because the opposite over the hypothesis
162:28 - of this angle has to equal sign a. A similar
argument shows that this side has to have
162:35 - measure cosine A time sign B. Please pause
the video and take a moment to fill in the
162:44 - side length of this right triangle. And this
right triangle, you should be getting sine
162:52 - A cosine B cosine A cosine B sine of A plus
B and cosine of A plus B. But remember, we
162:59 - have a rectangle here. So the opposite sides
have equal length. This tells us that sine
163:03 - of A plus B has to equal sine of A cosine
of B plus cosine of A sine of B, which is
163:12 - exactly the first angle sum formula. Also,
cosine of A plus B, which is this side length,
163:18 - is exactly the difference of this side length
cosine A cosine B minus this side length sine
163:24 - of A sine B. And that's the second angle sum
formula. So I think that's a pretty great
163:36 - geometric proof of the angle some formulas.
This video is about integrating trig functions
163:46 - that involve at least one odd power of sine
or cosine. Let's start by evaluating the integral
163:52 - of sine to the fourth x times cosine x dx.
This integral is a good candidate for u substitution.
164:07 - If we let u equal sine of x Then d u is equal
to cosine of x dx. And we can rewrite the
164:30 - integral as the integral of u to the fourth
do this integrates easily to 1/5 times u to
164:36 - the fifth plus C. And I can convert things
back to x by plugging in sine of x for you,
164:45 - to get 1/5 sine to the fifth of x plus C.
The next integral, the integral of sine to
164:55 - the fourth x times cosine cubed x dx can also
be handled with a similar use of the tuition
165:05 - with a bit more work. First, I'm going to
rewrite the integral as the integral of sine
165:16 - to the fourth x times cosine squared x times
cosine of x dx. I'm rewriting the cosine cubed
165:23 - of x as cosine squared of x times cosine x
in the hopes that I can use cosine of x dx
165:33 - as my d u, like I did in the previous problem.
Now if we have d u, as cosine of x, dx, we're
165:44 - going to need you to be sine of x. But unlike
the previous problem, I can't just replace
165:52 - sine of the fourth x with you to the fourth
and cosine x dx with D, U and be done. Because
166:03 - I've got this cosine squared x hanging around
that I need to deal with. I wish I didn't
166:11 - have that cosine squared x, I wish everything
else over here was just written in terms of
166:17 - sine. Now, as you might realize, it's not
hard for me to get my wish. We know from the
166:28 - Pythagorean identity, that cosine squared
of x plus sine squared of x is equal to one.
166:37 - So cosine squared of x can be written as one
minus sine squared x. Making that substitution,
166:45 - I can now rewrite my integral entirely in
terms of you. And do now if I multiply things
166:55 - out, this becomes easy to integrate, I get
1/5 u to the fifth minus 1/7 u to the seventh
167:02 - plus C. And I can rewrite this in terms of
x.
167:06 - Based on the middle right triangle with high
partners one, we know that this side length
167:14 - down here must be cosine of B, since adjacent
over hypotenuse is cosine B. Similarly, this
167:20 - side length here must be sine of B. Since
opposite of our hypothesis is sine of B, now
167:24 - we see that sine of B is the hypotenuse of
this right triangle, which means that this
167:31 - little side here has measure sign a time sign
B. That's because the opposite over the hypothesis
167:38 - of this angle has to equal sign a. A similar
argument shows that this side has to have
167:49 - measure cosine A time sign B. Please pause
the video and take a moment to fill in the
167:58 - side length of this right triangle. And this
right triangle, you should be getting sine
168:07 - A cosine B cosine A cosine B sine of A plus
B and cosine of A plus B. But remember, we
168:16 - have a rectangle here. So the opposite sides
have equal length. This tells us that sine
168:22 - of A plus B has to equal sine of A cosine
of B plus cosine of A sine of B, which is
168:33 - exactly the first angle sum formula. Also,
cosine of A plus B, which is this side length,
168:42 - is exactly the difference of this side length
cosine A cosine B minus this side length sine
168:49 - of A sine B. And that's the second angle sum
formula. So I think that's a pretty great
168:59 - geometric proof of the angle some formulas.
This video is about integrating trig functions
169:06 - that involve at least one odd power of sine
or cosine. Let's start by evaluating the integral
169:12 - of sine to the fourth x times cosine x dx.
This integral is a good candidate for u substitution.
169:17 - If we let u equal sine of x Then d u is equal
to cosine of x dx. And we can rewrite the
169:27 - integral as the integral of u to the fourth
do this integrates easily to 1/5 times u to
169:36 - the fifth plus C. And I can convert things
back to x by plugging in sine of x for you,
169:46 - to get 1/5 sine to the fifth of x plus C.
The next integral, the integral of sine to
169:52 - the fourth x times cosine cubed x dx can also
be handled with a similar use of the tuition
170:00 - with a bit more work. First, I'm going to
rewrite the integral as the integral of sine
170:06 - to the fourth x times cosine squared x times
cosine of x dx. I'm rewriting the cosine cubed
170:11 - of x as cosine squared of x times cosine x
in the hopes that I can use cosine of x dx
170:18 - as my d u, like I did in the previous problem.
Now if we have d u, as cosine of x, dx, we're
170:25 - going to need you to be sine of x. But unlike
the previous problem, I can't just replace
170:37 - sine of the fourth x with you to the fourth
and cosine x dx with D, U and be done. Because
170:45 - I've got this cosine squared x hanging around
that I need to deal with. I wish I didn't
170:52 - have that cosine squared x, I wish everything
else over here was just written in terms of
170:58 - sine. Now, as you might realize, it's not
hard for me to get my wish. We know from the
171:03 - Pythagorean identity, that cosine squared
of x plus sine squared of x is equal to one.
171:07 - So cosine squared of x can be written as one
minus sine squared x. Making that substitution,
171:13 - I can now rewrite my integral entirely in
terms of you. And do now if I multiply things
171:20 - out, this becomes easy to integrate, I get
1/5 u to the fifth minus 1/7 u to the seventh
171:26 - plus C. And I can rewrite this in terms of
x.
171:30 - To recap, we separated out one copy of cosine
x to be part of our D U. And then we converted
171:36 - the rest of the cosines in the signs isn't
a Pythagorean identity. This allowed us to
171:44 - do use of the tuition with u equal to sine
x and evaluate the integral. This same technique
171:49 - with some modifications works on a lot of
other problems. In this next problem, if we
171:55 - tried separating out one copy of cosine of
x to be part of our do, we'd run into problems,
172:02 - because we just have one copy of cosine x
left. And we can't use the Pythagorean identity
172:09 - can to convert a single cosine into signs.
Well, I guess technically, we could do something
172:15 - like this. But then we'd have to introduce
a plus or minus sign and a square root sign
172:22 - into our integrand, which would make things
difficult to integrate. It's a lot easier
172:28 - if we can just use the cosine squared x is
equal to one minus sine squared x identity
172:34 - to replace our cosines with signs. But this
identity only applies if we have an even power
172:40 - of cosines leftover that we want to convert.
So instead of trying to save out a copy of
172:43 - cosine x, let's say about a copy of sine x
instead. So we'll rewrite our integral as
172:48 - the integral of sine to the fourth of x times
a sine of x. And we'll keep the cosine squared
172:55 - x and the dx. Now we want the sine x to be
part of our D U. So let's set u equal to cosine
173:06 - of x. That way d u is equal to negative sine
of x dx. And so sine of x dx is equal to negative
173:11 - d U. since u is equal to cosine x, this time,
we want to replace all of our stray signs
173:20 - with cosines. We know that sine squared of
x is equal to one minus cosine squared of
173:25 - x by the Pythagorean identity. So let's rewrite
this sine to the fourth as sine squared of
173:32 - x squared. That allows us to substitute in
one minus cosine squared of x for sine squared
173:38 - of x And now we can replace everything with
us and d is I'll bring out the negative sign
173:44 - and multiply things out. One minus u squared
squared is one minus two u squared plus u
173:51 - to the fourth. And this multiplies out to
us squared minus two u to the fourth plus
173:59 - u to the sixth. Now I can integrate, distribute
my negative sign. And finally, plug in cosine
174:07 - of x for you. That completes this problem.
In this video, we'll use use substitution
174:11 - and the Pythagorean identity. To evaluate
integrals with at least one odd power of sine
174:17 - or cosine. The idea is to separate off one
copy from the odd power that one copy becomes
174:24 - part of our D U. and the remaining even power
gets converted using the Pythagorean identity.
174:36 - In this case, we convert sine squared into
one minus cosine squared. This allows us to
174:43 - do the use substitution and evaluate the integral.
In this video, we'll evaluate integrals of
174:51 - trig functions involving only even powers
of sine and cosine. There are three trig identities
174:59 - that will come in handy here, the first ones
that are familiar, the factory and identity.
175:05 - The second one's an identity that allows us
to rewrite cosine squared of x in terms of
175:10 - cosine of 2x. And the third one is in nd that
lets us write sine squared of x. Also in terms
175:19 - of cosine of 2x. The only difference between
the second and third is the fact that one's
175:27 - cosine squared and one sine squared. But the
other difference is the plus sign versus the
175:31 - minus sign here.
175:32 - To recap, we separated out one copy of cosine
x to be part of our D U. And then we converted
175:38 - the rest of the cosines in the signs isn't
a Pythagorean identity. This allowed us to
175:47 - do use of the tuition with u equal to sine
x and evaluate the integral. This same technique
175:53 - with some modifications works on a lot of

176:04 - because we just have one copy of cosine x
left. And we can't use the Pythagorean identity
176:11 - can to convert a single cosine into signs.
Well, I guess technically, we could do something
176:16 - like this. But then we'd have to introduce

176:21 - into our integrand, which would make things

176:30 - to replace our cosines with signs. But this

176:34 - of cosines leftover that we want to convert.
So instead of trying to save out a copy of
176:38 - cosine x, let's say about a copy of sine x
instead. So we'll rewrite our integral as
176:45 - the integral of sine to the fourth of x times
a sine of x. And we'll keep the cosine squared
176:55 - x and the dx. Now we want the sine x to be
part of our D U. So let's set u equal to cosine
177:06 - of x. That way d u is equal to negative sine
of x dx. And so sine of x dx is equal to negative
177:21 - d U. since u is equal to cosine x, this time,
we want to replace all of our stray signs
177:31 - with cosines. We know that sine squared of
x is equal to one minus cosine squared of
177:41 - x by the Pythagorean identity. So let's rewrite
this sine to the fourth as sine squared of
177:52 - x squared. That allows us to substitute in
one minus cosine squared of x for sine squared
177:59 - of x And now we can replace everything with
us and d is I'll bring out the negative sign
178:07 - and multiply things out. One minus u squared
squared is one minus two u squared plus u
178:12 - to the fourth. And this multiplies out to
us squared minus two u to the fourth plus
178:20 - u to the sixth. Now I can integrate, distribute
my negative sign. And finally, plug in cosine
178:30 - of x for you. That completes this problem.
In this video, we'll use use substitution
178:37 - and the Pythagorean identity. To evaluate
integrals with at least one odd power of sine
178:43 - or cosine. The idea is to separate off one
copy from the odd power that one copy becomes
178:49 - part of our D U. and the remaining even power
gets converted using the Pythagorean identity.
178:57 - In this case, we convert sine squared into
one minus cosine squared. This allows us to
179:07 - do the use substitution and evaluate the integral.
In this video, we'll evaluate integrals of
179:13 - trig functions involving only even powers
of sine and cosine. There are three trig identities
179:18 - that will come in handy here, the first ones
that are familiar, the factory and identity.
179:24 - The second one's an identity that allows us
to rewrite cosine squared of x in terms of
179:30 - cosine of 2x. And the third one is in nd that
lets us write sine squared of x. Also in terms
179:36 - of cosine of 2x. The only difference between
the second and third is the fact that one's
179:41 - cosine squared and one sine squared. But the
other difference is the plus sign versus the
179:46 - minus sign here.
179:48 - Let's start with the simplest possible even
power, the integral of cosine squared x dx.
179:54 - According to my calculator, this integral
evaluates to sine x cosine x over two plus
180:00 - x over two. And if I look it up in the back
of my book, I get the integral to be one half
180:10 - x plus one for a sine of 2x. So what's going
on here? Are these two answers really the
180:17 - same? Well, yes, because sine of 2x is equal
to two times sine x cosine x. So if I replace
180:25 - that, here, I get this second answer is equivalent
to one half x plus 1/4 times two sine x cosine
180:35 - x, which is equivalent to the first answer.
Notice that the calculator on the table in
180:47 - the back of the book omit the plus c the cost
of integration, but you should always include
180:53 - them for indefinite integrals. Now let's see
where these answers come from. So let's compute
180:59 - the integral of cosine squared x dx by hand
that is, without the aid of a calculator or
181:06 - computer integral table, the hint is that
cosine squared x is equal to one plus cosine
181:10 - 2x over two, or sometimes I like to write
this as one half plus one half cosine of 2x.
181:17 - So I'll use that identity to rewrite my integral.
Now I can split up the integral using rules
181:24 - about integration. The integral of one half
is just one half x, and the integral of cosine
181:30 - of 2x is one half times sine of 2x. It's possible
to get that answer by use substitution with
181:38 - u equal to x. Or as a shortcut, we can observe
that the derivative of sine of 2x is cosine
181:39 - of 2x times two, the times two comes from
the chain rule taking the derivative of the
181:44 - inside. So to get rid of that, or counteract
that, times two, we have to multiply by one
181:49 - half. In any case, our final answer is then
one half x plus 1/4 sine of 2x plus C. This
182:02 - is the same answer that we can find using
the integral table in the back of the book.
182:09 - Please pause the video for a minute and try
to compute the integral of sine squared x
182:14 - dx. Using a similar technique. You'll want
to use the identity sine squared of x is equal
182:20 - to one half minus one Half cosine of 2x. If
you rewrite the integral, you can integrate
182:26 - like before, and get an answer of one half
x minus 1/4 sine of 2x plus C, the same technique
182:33 - can be used to evaluate a lot of other integrals
involving even powers of sine and cosine,
182:39 - often with a lot more effort. Let's try evaluating
the integral of sine to the sixth x dx. We
182:46 - know that sine squared of x is equal to one
half minus one half cosine of 2x. And since
182:52 - six is an even power, we know we can rewrite
sine to the sixth as sine squared to the x
183:07 - raised to a power, in this case, the power
of three. Now let's substitute in our identity.
183:17 - I think I'm going to factor out the one half.
One half cubed is 1/8. So I'll pull the one
183:30 - eight out of the integral side and multiply
out. Now let me divide up my integral into
183:38 - pieces. And I'll try to handle each piece
separately. The integral of one dx, that's
183:45 - easy, that's x, and the integral of cosine
of 2x, that's going to be one half times sine
183:53 - of 2x, like before. Now to integrate cosine
squared of 2x, we can use the same trick we
184:02 - used to integrate cosine squared of x, cosine
squared of 2x is going to be one half, plus
184:10 - one half cosine of two times 2x. So that's
4x.
184:17 - Let's start with the simplest possible even
power, the integral of cosine squared x dx.
184:27 - According to my calculator, this integral
evaluates to sine x cosine x over two plus
184:37 - x 
over two. And if I look it up in the back
184:49 - of my book, I get the integral to be one half
x plus one for a sine of 2x. So what's going
184:58 - on here? Are these two answers really the
same? Well, yes, because sine of 2x is equal
185:05 - to two times sine x cosine x. So if I replace
that, here, I get this second answer is equivalent
185:10 - to one half x plus 1/4 times two sine x cosine
x, which is equivalent to the first answer.
185:21 - Notice that the calculator on the table in
the back of the book omit the plus c the cost
185:38 - of integration, but you should always include
them for indefinite integrals. Now let's see
185:44 - where these answers come from. So let's compute
the integral of cosine squared x dx by hand
185:51 - that is, without the aid of a calculator or
computer integral table, the hint is that
185:57 - cosine squared x is equal to one plus cosine
2x over two, or sometimes I like to write
186:03 - this as one half plus one half cosine of 2x.
So I'll use that identity to rewrite my integral.
186:12 - Now I can split up the integral using rules
about integration. The integral of one half
186:19 - is just one half x, and the integral of cosine
of 2x is one half times sine of 2x. It's possible
186:25 - to get that answer by use substitution with
u equal to x. Or as a shortcut, we can observe
186:31 - that the derivative of sine of 2x is cosine
of 2x times two, the times two comes from
186:38 - the chain rule taking the derivative of the
inside. So to get rid of that, or counteract
186:45 - that, times two, we have to multiply by one
half. In any case, our final answer is then
186:52 - one half x plus 1/4 sine of 2x plus C. This
is the same answer that we can find using
187:00 - the integral table in the back of the book.
Please pause the video for a minute and try
187:09 - to compute the integral of sine squared x
dx. Using a similar technique. You'll want
187:18 - to use the identity sine squared of x is equal
to one half minus one Half cosine of 2x. If
187:22 - you rewrite the integral, you can integrate
like before, and get an answer of one half
187:25 - x minus 1/4 sine of 2x plus C, the same technique
can be used to evaluate a lot of other integrals
187:40 - involving even powers of sine and cosine,
often with a lot more effort. Let's try evaluating
187:47 - the integral of sine to the sixth x dx. We
know that sine squared of x is equal to one
187:52 - half minus one half cosine of 2x. And since
six is an even power, we know we can rewrite
187:59 - sine to the sixth as sine squared to the x
raised to a power, in this case, the power
188:02 - of three. Now let's substitute in our identity.
I think I'm going to factor out the one half.
188:09 - One half cubed is 1/8. So I'll pull the one
eight out of the integral side and multiply
188:16 - out. Now let me divide up my integral into
pieces. And I'll try to handle each piece
188:24 - separately. The integral of one dx, that's
easy, that's x, and the integral of cosine
188:34 - of 2x, that's going to be one half times sine
of 2x, like before. Now to integrate cosine
188:45 - squared of 2x, we can use the same trick we
used to integrate cosine squared of x, cosine
188:51 - squared of 2x is going to be one half, plus
one half cosine of two times 2x. So that's
188:56 - 4x.
188:57 - And finally, to integrate cosine cubed of
2x, well, cosine cubed is an odd power, so
189:00 - we can use our odd power trick and save aside
one copy of cosine, and turn the remaining
189:03 - cosine squared into one minus sine squared.
So that looks like this. Notice we have one
189:07 - minus sine squared of 2x. Because we're replacing
a cosine squared of 2x. I'll copy the first
189:13 - part down. Now integrate one half to get one
half x, and I'll integrate one half cosine
189:19 - of forex. To get one half times 1/4 sine of
forex, we need the 1/4. To counteract the
189:31 - four that we get by taking the derivative
of sine of 4x. And using the chain rule, we
189:39 - can finish off the integration by using a
use substitution here where u is sine of 2x.
189:47 - And so d u is two cosine of 2x. So we can
replace this integral here with minus the
189:55 - integral of one minus us squared times, one
half do I'll copy the first part down again.
190:03 - and integrate that last part, I'll pull out
the negative a half, and I get you minus 1/3
190:11 - u cubed, I need a plus C. Now. I'll plug back
in for you and simplify a little bit. And
190:22 - I get a final answer of five sixteenths x
minus one for sine of 2x plus 360 fourths
190:31 - sine of 4x plus 148, sine cubed of 2x. Oh,
and we need a plus C here. That's a complicated
190:40 - answer. And it was a complicated computation.
But it was all based on the same sort of tricks
190:45 - as before, using identities like this one,
to handle even powers of sine and cosine,
190:50 - and using the Pythagorean identity to handle
odd powers. In this video, we use these last
190:54 - two identities to rewrite even powers of cosine
and sine in terms of lower powers of cosine.
190:58 - This trick can be used to compute the integrals
of complicated even powers of sine and cosine,
191:07 - provided that you have a lot of time and patience
on hand. This video is about some special
191:22 - trig integrals, namely, the integral of tangent
squared of x and the integral of secant of
191:30 - x. these integrals are special only in the
sense that there's some special tricks required
191:33 - to integrate them. When I come across the
integral of tangent squared X, I find myself
191:42 - wishing that I could integrate secant squared
x instead, because integrating secant squared
191:48 - x is easy. It's just tangent x plus c since
the derivative of a tangent secant squared.
191:54 - But happily, I know how to rewrite tangent
squared in terms of secant, because tangent
192:03 - squared is secant squared minus one. So I'll
just rewrite this integral as the integral
192:13 - of secant squared minus one. And that integrates
easily to tangent of x minus x plus C. The
192:20 - same sort of trick works to integrate cotangent
squared of x, since there's a similar identity,
192:29 - relating cotangent and cosecant every now
and then, you have to integrate secant of
192:38 - x. There's several possible tricks that can
be used to do this. One of them is to multiply
192:46 - secant x by secant x plus tangent x in the
numerator and denominator. Now distributing,
192:51 - we get seacon squared x plus seek index tangent
x in the numerator, and secant x plus tangent
192:58 - x in the denominator. Since secant squared
is the derivative of tangent, and secant tangent
193:05 - is the root of a secant. We can say u equal
to secant x plus tangent x and have d u, sitting
193:13 - right where we want it in the integrand.
193:16 - And finally, to integrate cosine cubed of
2x, well, cosine cubed is an odd power, so
193:22 - we can use our odd power trick and save aside
one copy of cosine, and turn the remaining
193:29 - cosine squared into one minus sine squared.
So that looks like this. Notice we have one
193:33 - minus sine squared of 2x. Because we're replacing
a cosine squared of 2x. I'll copy the first
193:37 - part down. Now integrate one half to get one
half x, and I'll integrate one half cosine
193:43 - of forex. To get one half times 1/4 sine of
forex, we need the 1/4. To counteract the
193:47 - four that we get by taking the derivative
of sine of 4x. And using the chain rule, we
193:52 - can finish off the integration by using a
use substitution here where u is sine of 2x.
193:57 - And so d u is two cosine of 2x. So we can
replace this integral here with minus the
194:04 - integral of one minus us squared times, one
half do I'll copy the first part down again.
194:11 - and integrate that last part, I'll pull out
the negative a half, and I get you minus 1/3
194:19 - u cubed, I need a plus C. Now. I'll plug back
in for you and simplify a little bit. And
194:28 - I get a final answer of five sixteenths x
minus one for sine of 2x plus 360 fourths
194:34 - sine of 4x plus 148, sine cubed of 2x. Oh,
and we need a plus C here. That's a complicated
194:43 - answer. And it was a complicated computation.
But it was all based on the same sort of tricks
194:51 - as before, using identities like this one,
to handle even powers of sine and cosine,
194:57 - and using the Pythagorean identity to handle
odd powers. In this video, we use these last
195:05 - two identities to rewrite even powers of cosine
and sine in terms of lower powers of cosine.
195:11 - This trick can be used to compute the integrals
of complicated even powers of sine and cosine,
195:19 - provided that you have a lot of time and patience
on hand. This video is about some special
195:26 - trig integrals, namely, the integral of tangent

integral of tangent squared X, I find myself

195:51 - x is easy. It's just tangent x plus c since
the derivative of a tangent secant squared.
195:59 - But happily, I know how to rewrite tangent
squared in terms of secant, because tangent
196:07 - squared is secant squared minus one. So I'll
just rewrite this integral as the integral
196:14 - of secant squared minus one. And that integrates
easily to tangent of x minus x plus C. The
196:22 - same sort of trick works to integrate cotangent
squared of x, since there's a similar identity,
196:29 - relating cotangent and cosecant every now
and then, you have to integrate secant of
196:34 - x. There's several possible tricks that can
be used to do this. One of them is to multiply
196:38 - secant x by secant x plus tangent x in the
numerator and denominator. Now distributing,
196:43 - we get seacon squared x plus seek index tangent
x in the numerator, and secant x plus tangent
196:50 - x in the denominator. Since secant squared
is the derivative of tangent, and secant tangent
196:55 - is the root of a secant. We can say u equal
to secant x plus tangent x and have d u, sitting
197:03 - right where we want it in the integrand.
197:06 - So now we just have to integrate one over
u d u, which is the ln of u plus C. And now
197:13 - plugging back in for you, we get that our
original integral of seeking dx evaluates
197:19 - to the natural log of secant x plus tangent
x plus a constant. A similar trick can be
197:32 - used to evaluate the integral of cosecant
x. And that's all for the integral of tangent
197:43 - squared, and the integral of secant. This
video introduces the technique of trig substitution
197:51 - to evaluate integrals involving square root
signs like this one. There are a few trig
198:01 - identities that are especially useful for
this technique. The first one's the Pythagorean
198:07 - identity. And the second is the related identity
that involves tangent and secant. There's
198:12 - also a third related identity that involves
cotangent cosecant. This one could also be
198:16 - used in the method of tree substitution, although
it doesn't come up as often as the first two.
198:23 - As our first example, let's look at the integral
of x squared over the square root of 49 minus
198:34 - x squared. According to Wolfram Alpha, this
integral evaluates to this expression involving
198:41 - a square root expression kind of an as expected
and a sine inverse, which just sort of come
198:52 - seems to come out of the blue here. Let's
see where this answer comes from. Using a
198:59 - trig substitution. The inverse sine function
in the answer gives us a hint that we may
199:08 - want to substitute in something related to
sign, I'm going to substitute in x equals
199:16 - seven sine theta. If x is seven sine theta,
then dx is going to be seven cosine theta
199:27 - d theta. Now I'll substitute in for x and
dx in my integral to get the integral of seven
199:38 - sine theta squared over the square root of
49 minus seven sine theta squared times seven
199:44 - cosine theta d theta. let me simplify a little.
I have a seven cubed in the numerator times
199:51 - sine squared theta cosine theta. And the nominator
I have 49 minus 49 sine squared theta. I'll
199:58 - factor out the 49 here. And since the square
root of 49 is seven, I can pull a seven out
200:04 - of the square root sign. Now here is where
a little bit of magic occurs. I know that
200:09 - one minus sine squared theta is equal to cosine
squared The data by the Pythagorean identity,
200:17 - and the square root of cosine squared theta
is equal to cosine theta, well, actually,
200:25 - it's equal to the absolute value of cosine
theta, which is the same thing as cosine theta,
200:32 - if cosine theta is positive. Or in other words,
if theta is between pi over two, and negative
200:41 - pi over two, for example, I would really like
to replace my square root of one minus sine
200:47 - squared theta by just cosine theta, not the
absolute value of cosine theta. So I'm just
201:00 - going to assume that theta is between negative
pi over two and pi over two when I make my
201:08 - substitution. This might seem like cheating,
but it's actually legit. Because if you think
201:14 - about the unit circle, as theta ranges from
negative pi over two to pi over two, well,
201:20 - cosine is always positive like we want it
to be. But sine is ranging all the way from
201:30 - negative one to one. And so we can actually
achieve all of the x values between negative
201:39 - seven and seven this way, which are the only
x values in the domain of our function anyway.
201:48 - Now if we go back to our integral, we can
actually replace the square root of one minus
201:55 - sine squared theta with a simple cosine theta,
with success successfully gotten rid of this
202:04 - tricky square root sign, which is the whole
point behind trig substitution. Now, if we
202:11 - simplify, we just have to integrate seven
squared sine squared theta, d theta. And this
202:15 - is a familiar problem that we can solve using
another trig identity.
202:21 - So now we just have to integrate one over
u d u, which is the ln of u plus C. And now
202:32 - plugging back in for you, we get that our
original integral of seeking dx evaluates
202:37 - to the natural log of secant x plus tangent
x plus a constant. A similar trick can be
202:43 - used to evaluate the integral of cosecant
x. And that's all for the integral of tangent
202:47 - squared, and the integral of secant. This

203:05 - As our first example, let's look at the integral
of x squared over the square root of 49 minus
203:10 - x squared. According to Wolfram Alpha, this
integral evaluates to this expression involving
203:13 - a square root expression kind of an as expected
and a sine inverse, which just sort of come

in the answer gives us a hint that we may
203:30 - want to substitute in something related to
sign, I'm going to substitute in x equals
203:38 - seven sine theta. If x is seven sine theta,
then dx is going to be seven cosine theta
203:49 - d theta. Now I'll substitute in for x and
dx in my integral to get the integral of seven
204:03 - sine theta squared over the square root of
49 minus seven sine theta squared times seven
204:10 - cosine theta d theta. let me simplify a little.
I have a seven cubed in the numerator times
204:17 - sine squared theta cosine theta. And the nominator
I have 49 minus 49 sine squared theta. I'll
204:22 - factor out the 49 here. And since the square

if theta is between pi over two, and negative

pi over two and pi over two when I make my
205:27 - substitution. This might seem like cheating,

205:32 - about the unit circle, as theta ranges from
negative pi over two to pi over two, well,
205:39 - cosine is always positive like we want it
to be. But sine is ranging all the way from
205:47 - negative one to one. And so we can actually
achieve all of the x values between negative
205:54 - seven and seven this way, which are the only
x values in the domain of our function anyway.
206:02 - Now if we go back to our integral, we can
actually replace the square root of one minus
206:10 - sine squared theta with a simple cosine theta,
with success successfully gotten rid of this
206:17 - tricky square root sign, which is the whole
point behind trig substitution. Now, if we
206:26 - simplify, we just have to integrate seven
squared sine squared theta, d theta. And this
206:40 - is a familiar problem that we can solve using
another trig identity.
206:47 - Now we've got an integral we can compute.
So the integral of one half is one half theta,
206:58 - and the integral of cosine of two theta is
one half sine of two theta. So let me add
207:08 - my constant of integration. And I'm almost
done, almost, but not quite. Because this
207:13 - answer is in terms of theta, and my original
problem was in terms of x. Now I know that
207:25 - x and theta are related, according to this
equation here. So if I solve for theta, I
207:31 - get sine theta is equal to x over seven. So
theta is inverse sine or arc sine of x over
207:40 - seven. So I could just plug in for theta here
and get seven squared, that's 49 times one
207:47 - half sine inverse x over seven minus one half
times one half is 1/4. sine of two times sine
207:58 - inverse x over seven plus C. This is a correct
answer. But it's very awkward looking sine
208:04 - of twice sine inverse x over seven, there's
got to be a way to simplify this. Unfortunately,
208:08 - we can't just pull the two out and cancel
the sign with a sine inverse, because sine
208:15 - does work that way. But instead, we can use
the double angle formula. So we can rewrite
208:21 - sine of two theta as twice sine theta cosine
theta. So let me ignore this line for now.
208:28 - And I'll rewrite the above line as 49 times
one half theta, minus 1/4 times twice sine
208:33 - theta, cosine theta
208:34 - Now we've got an integral we can compute.
So the integral of one half is one half theta,
208:42 - and the integral of cosine of two theta is
one half sine of two theta. So let me add
208:49 - my constant of integration. And I'm almost
done, almost, but not quite. Because this
208:57 - answer is in terms of theta, and my original
problem was in terms of x. Now I know that
209:07 - x and theta are related, according to this
equation here. So if I solve for theta, I
209:16 - get sine theta is equal to x over seven. So
theta is inverse sine or arc sine of x over
209:22 - seven. So I could just plug in for theta here
and get seven squared, that's 49 times one
209:29 - half sine inverse x over seven minus one half
times one half is 1/4. sine of two times sine
209:38 - inverse x over seven plus C. This is a correct
answer. But it's very awkward looking sine
209:49 - of twice sine inverse x over seven, there's
got to be a way to simplify this. Unfortunately,
209:59 - we can't just pull the two out and cancel
the sign with a sine inverse, because sine
210:07 - does work that way. But instead, we can use
the double angle formula. So we can rewrite
210:13 - sine of two theta as twice sine theta cosine
theta. So let me ignore this line for now.
210:15 - And I'll rewrite the above line as 49 times
one half theta, minus 1/4 times twice sine
210:24 - theta, cosine theta
210:25 - plus C.
210:26 - plus C.
210:27 - Now there's one more trick we need to use.
And that trick is to draw a right triangle.
210:37 - I'm going to label the sides of that triangle
using the equation for the substitution we
210:45 - made, or this equivalent forms a little easier
to use. So since sine theta is x over seven,
210:50 - if I label one of my angles as theta, then
the opposite side needs to have a measure
210:55 - of x, and I have partners should have a measure
of seven. You can check that by the Pythagorean
211:02 - Theorem, that means that this bottom side
needs to have a measure of the square root
211:11 - of 49 minus x squared. Notice that that's
exactly the same expression that was in our
211:18 - original integrand. Once we have the triangle
labeled, we can use it to find expressions
211:26 - for sine of theta and cosine of theta in terms
of x. So Sine of theta is opposite of our
211:35 - hypothesis. So that's x over seven. Well,
we already knew that. But now cosine of theta
211:43 - is adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's the
square root of 49 minus x squared over seven.
211:49 - We can use these two equations to substitute
in for sine theta and cosine theta. And to
211:56 - get rid of the, this naked theta here, we'll
still have to use the fact that theta is inverse
212:05 - sine of x over seven. Those substitutions
lead us to this answer. And a little bit of
212:11 - simplification leads us to the same answer
that Wolfram Alpha gave us. This was a complicated
212:19 - problem. But the key step was to use this
trig substitution. And then, that allowed
212:28 - us to use a trig identity in order to rewrite
our square root and get rid of the square
212:37 - root. After that, it was a fairly routine
integration problem, until we got to the point
212:47 - where we had to substitute back in for theta,
and then drawing the right triangle helped
212:55 - us figure out what to do. In this video, we
use two trig substitution to evaluate an integral
213:03 - with a square root and that This video introduces
the method of partial fractions as a way to
213:13 - integrate many rational functions. Recall
that a rational function is a function of
213:16 - the form a polynomial divided by another polynomial.
Let's work out the integral of 3x plus two
213:26 - divided by x squared plus 2x minus three.
According to Wolfram Alpha, the integral evaluates
213:33 - to this expression involving the log of x
minus one and the log of x plus three. So
213:40 - what do x minus one and x plus three have
to do with our original rational function,
213:47 - I challenge you to pause the video for a moment
and try to figure this out. You might have
213:57 - noticed that the denominator x squared plus
2x minus three factors into x minus one times
214:02 - x plus three. Let's look at what happens if
I take two separate fractions, one with denominator
214:07 - x minus one and one with denominator x plus
three and add them up. The common denominator
214:14 - of these two fractions is x minus one times
x plus three. So when I add these fractions
214:22 - together using standard algebra, I should
get a fraction with common denominator, x
214:28 - minus one times x plus three. Well, my original
rational function was just such a fraction.
214:39 - So it seems plausible, that I might be able
to find numbers, a and b, so that these two
214:46 - partial fractions add up to this original
fraction. Let's figure out what numbers a
214:51 - and b might make this work. To solve for A
and B, I'm going to clear the denominator
214:59 - by multiplying both sides of my equation by
this least common denominator, x minus 1x
215:05 - plus three. When I distribute on the left
side, I get x plus three times a plus x minus
215:19 - one times B. And on the right side, my x minus
one and x plus three cancel out to give me
215:30 - 3x plus two. I'll distribute the left side
a little further. And I'm going to group the
215:39 - terms that involve x and the terms that don't
involve x. If I want this equation to hold
215:47 - true for all values of x, then I need the
coefficients of x to be the same on the left
216:03 - and the right.
216:06 - Now there's one more trick we need to use.
And that trick is to draw a right triangle.
216:14 - I'm going to label the sides of that triangle
using the equation for the substitution we
216:23 - made, or this equivalent forms a little easier
to use. So since sine theta is x over seven,
216:33 - if I label one of my angles as theta, then
the opposite side needs to have a measure
216:41 - of x, and I have partners should have a measure
of seven. You can check that by the Pythagorean
216:45 - Theorem, that means that this bottom side
needs to have a measure of the square root
216:52 - of 49 minus x squared. Notice that that's
exactly the same expression that was in our
216:58 - original integrand. Once we have the triangle
labeled, we can use it to find expressions
217:06 - for sine of theta and cosine of theta in terms
of x. So Sine of theta is opposite of our
217:15 - hypothesis. So that's x over seven. Well,
we already knew that. But now cosine of theta
217:21 - is adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's the
square root of 49 minus x squared over seven.
217:28 - We can use these two equations to substitute
in for sine theta and cosine theta. And to
217:35 - get rid of the, this naked theta here, we'll
still have to use the fact that theta is inverse
217:44 - sine of x over seven. Those substitutions
lead us to this answer. And a little bit of
217:53 - simplification leads us to the same answer
that Wolfram Alpha gave us. This was a complicated
217:58 - problem. But the key step was to use this
trig substitution. And then, that allowed
218:03 - us to use a trig identity in order to rewrite
our square root and get rid of the square
218:05 - root. After that, it was a fairly routine
integration problem, until we got to the point
218:08 - where we had to substitute back in for theta,
and then drawing the right triangle helped
218:14 - us figure out what to do. In this video, we
use two trig substitution to evaluate an integral
218:21 - with a square root and that This video introduces
the method of partial fractions as a way to
218:27 - integrate many rational functions. Recall
that a rational function is a function of
218:34 - the form a polynomial divided by another polynomial.
Let's work out the integral of 3x plus two
218:40 - divided by x squared plus 2x minus three.
According to Wolfram Alpha, the integral evaluates
218:45 - to this expression involving the log of x
minus one and the log of x plus three. So
218:53 - what do x minus one and x plus three have
to do with our original rational function,
219:01 - I challenge you to pause the video for a moment
and try to figure this out. You might have
219:09 - noticed that the denominator x squared plus
2x minus three factors into x minus one times
219:15 - x plus three. Let's look at what happens if
I take two separate fractions, one with denominator
219:17 - x minus one and one with denominator x plus
three and add them up. The common denominator
219:23 - of these two fractions is x minus one times
x plus three. So when I add these fractions
219:29 - together using standard algebra, I should
get a fraction with common denominator, x
219:34 - minus one times x plus three. Well, my original
rational function was just such a fraction.
219:39 - So it seems plausible, that I might be able
to find numbers, a and b, so that these two
219:44 - partial fractions add up to this original
fraction. Let's figure out what numbers a
219:50 - and b might make this work. To solve for A
and B, I'm going to clear the denominator
219:57 - by multiplying both sides of my equation by
this least common denominator, x minus 1x
220:02 - plus three. When I distribute on the left
side, I get x plus three times a plus x minus
220:07 - one times B. And on the right side, my x minus
one and x plus three cancel out to give me
220:13 - 3x plus two. I'll distribute the left side
a little further. And I'm going to group the
220:18 - terms that involve x and the terms that don't
involve x. If I want this equation to hold
220:25 - true for all values of x, then I need the
coefficients of x to be the same on the left
220:31 - and the right.
220:32 - So I need a plus b to equal three. Similarly,
I need the constant term to be the same on
220:38 - the left and the right. So I need three A
minus B to equal two. I now have two linear
220:49 - equations in the two unknowns, a and b. So
I can use standard algebra to solve these
221:01 - equations for A and B. For example, if I add
the two equations together, the B and negative
221:08 - b cancel out to give me four A equals five,
and so a equals five fourths. And then I can
221:15 - substitute in this five fourths into either
one of my equations and solve for b. So I
221:23 - was able to find an a value of a and b that
let me rewrite the original fraction as to
221:36 - partial fractions. Let me fill those values
of a and b in here. Now to calculate the integral
221:43 - of my original expression, I can calculate
the integral of my partial fractions. Instead,
221:53 - I split up my integrals here. Now the integral
of one over x minus one is natural log of
222:07 - absolute value of x minus one, you can check
this by taking the derivative. Or you can
222:16 - do a simple use of the tuition where you as
x minus one to compute this integral. Similarly,
222:24 - the integral of one over x plus three is natural
log of absolute value of x plus three. This
222:31 - completes the computation of the integral
using the method of partial fractions. Recall
222:36 - that after factoring our denominator, the
key step in this process was finding numbers
222:42 - a and b that made this equation hold. And
you might wonder, Well, yeah, it work this
222:50 - time. But can we always find numbers a and
b that will work like that? What if our numerator
223:00 - had been something different? What if our
numerator had been instead something like,
223:06 - say 7x minus 15? Could we have still found
an A and B that worked? Well, yes, because
223:15 - we still would have gotten two linear equations
in two unknowns down here, and we would have
223:24 - been able to solve them, we'd get different
values of a and b, but we still would have
223:33 - been able to find a solution. Even if our
numerator had just been a number, like six,
223:40 - we still couldn't use the same method, we
could have thought of this as 0x plus six.
223:45 - And we could have used the same equations
down here, where A plus B would have to equals
223:52 - zero, and three, A minus B would have to equal
six. So we still have two equations and two
224:00 - unknowns to solve for. In fact, if you think
about it for a while, you may be able to convince
224:09 - yourself that this method will always work
if you have two conditions. First, the denominator
224:15 - factors into distinct linear factors. By a
linear factor, I just mean that the factor
224:20 - can be written like a number times x plus
another number, with no x squared or anything
224:26 - in it. And by distinct, I just mean that these
two factors are different from each other.
224:32 - The second condition is that the degree of
the numerator is lower than the degree of
224:40 - the denominator. The second condition guarantee
is that we'll have the same number of unknowns
224:46 - here, A and B, as we do coefficients here,
three, and two, so that we'll have equations
224:51 - that we'll be able to solve for our unknowns.
As a technical note, that distinctness of
224:58 - the linear factors guarantees that we won't
have contradictory equations. If we have these
225:04 - two conditions, then we can proceed to integrate,
like we did in this example. In fact, this
225:11 - method even works if we have more than two
linear factors, in our denominator, we can
225:17 - have three or four, any number of distinct
linear factors, it'll just get a little bit
225:21 - more complicated, because we'll have more
constants and more equations to solve for
225:24 - those constants. There are also several related
methods that allow us to integrate rational
225:30 - functions, even if the denominator factors
into linear factors that aren't necessarily
225:34 - distinct. Or even if we can't get all the
way down to linear factors, and some of our
225:41 - factors have squares in them, or even if the
degree of the numerator is too big. But I
225:49 - won't get into the details of those related
methods. In this video, you'll have to read
225:55 - about them in the book or wait for class or
wait for a future video to find out more.
226:07 - In this video, we integrated a rational function
by splitting up the fraction into two partial
226:13 - fractions.
226:14 - So I need a plus b to equal three. Similarly,
I need the constant term to be the same on
226:18 - the left and the right. So I need three A
minus B to equal two. I now have two linear
226:24 - equations in the two unknowns, a and b. So
I can use standard algebra to solve these
226:28 - equations for A and B. For example, if I add
the two equations together, the B and negative
226:35 - b cancel out to give me four A equals five,
and so a equals five fourths. And then I can
226:43 - substitute in this five fourths into either
one of my equations and solve for b. So I
226:50 - was able to find an a value of a and b that
let me rewrite the original fraction as to
226:57 - partial fractions. Let me fill those values
of a and b in here. Now to calculate the integral
227:02 - of my original expression, I can calculate
the integral of my partial fractions. Instead,
227:07 - I split up my integrals here. Now the integral
of one over x minus one is natural log of
227:14 - absolute value of x minus one, you can check

227:46 - a and b that made this equation hold. And

228:03 - say 7x minus 15? Could we have still found

228:10 - we still would have gotten two linear equations

wait for a future video to find out more.
230:42 - In this video, we integrated a rational function
by splitting up the fraction into two partial
230:47 - fractions.
230:48 - This video is about improper integrals, especially
the first type, which I'll define in a moment.
230:52 - Two examples of improper integrals are the
integral from one to infinity of one over
230:57 - x squared dx, and the integral from zero to
pi over two of tan x dx. What makes these
231:06 - integrals improper? Well, in the first example,
it's this infinity in the bound of integration.
231:13 - And then the second example, is the fact that
the function, tan of x itself goes to infinity
231:19 - on the interval from zero to pi over two where
we're integrating. So an integral is called
231:21 - improper. If either of these two situations
occur. It's called a type one improper integral
231:26 - if we're integrating over an infinite interval.
In other words, there's an infinity or negative
231:33 - infinity somewhere in the bounds of integration.
So the first example, is a type one improper
231:43 - integral. A type two improper integral occurs
when the function that we're integrating itself
231:48 - has an infinite discontinuity on the interval.
by an infinite discontinuity, I mean the function
231:53 - is going to infinity or negative infinity,
this is also called a vertical asymptote.
232:04 - This vertical asymptote could occur in the
interior of the interval we're integrating
232:11 - over. Or, as in this example, it could occur
on the endpoint of that interval of integration.
232:20 - Now, it's possible that both of these situations
could occur for the same integral. And that's
232:28 - also an improper integral. This video will
focus on type one improper integrals. A type
232:35 - one improper integral, asks us to integrate
over an infinite interval. To do this, we
232:41 - take the integral over larger and larger finite
intervals and take the limit. So for example,
232:50 - to find the integral from one to infinity
of one over x squared dx, we'll evaluate the
232:55 - integral from one to some finite number T,
and then take the limit as t goes off to infinity.
233:03 - In symbols, we can write the limit as t goes
to infinity of the integral from one to T
233:08 - of one over x squared dx. Since one over x
squared is the same thing as x to the minus
233:19 - two, we can integrate it to get negative x
to the minus one evaluated between one and
233:26 - T, and then take that limit or rewrite this
as negative one over x and evaluate on the
233:41 - bounds of integration. as t goes to infinity,
one over t goes to zero. So the limit just
233:49 - comes from this expression, which evaluates
to one. If we think of it, the integral is
233:56 - representing area, this is a little surprising.
Even though we're taking the area of an infinitely
234:08 - long region, the area still evaluates to a
finite number of one. In this situation, we
234:14 - say that the improper integral converges.
So in general, the improper integral from
234:22 - some finite number a 
to infinity of f of x dx is defined as the
234:37 - limit as t goes to infinity of the integral
from a to T of f of x dx. We say that the
234:46 - integral converges if this limit exists as
a finite number. And we say that the integral
234:55 - diverges if the limit is infinity, or negative
infinity, or if it doesn't exist. Similarly,
235:00 - we evaluate the integral from negative infinity
to some finite number by taking bigger and
235:07 - bigger intervals that extend off to negative
infinity. That is, this integral is defined
235:12 - as the limit as the left endpoint t goes to
negative infinity of the integral from t to
235:16 - b of f of x dx. We say that this integral
converges if the limit exists as a finite
235:24 - number, and diverges otherwise. So to evaluate
the integral from negative infinity to negative
235:28 - one of one over x dx, we take the limit as
t goes to negative infinity
235:32 - This video is about improper integrals, especially
the first type, which I'll define in a moment.
235:37 - Two examples of improper integrals are the
integral from one to infinity of one over
235:42 - x squared dx, and the integral from zero to
pi over two of tan x dx. What makes these
235:54 - integrals improper? Well, in the first example,
it's this infinity in the bound of integration.
236:02 - And then the second example, is the fact that
the function, tan of x itself goes to infinity
236:05 - on the interval from zero to pi over two where
we're integrating. So an integral is called
236:11 - improper. If either of these two situations
occur. It's called a type one improper integral
236:15 - if we're integrating over an infinite interval.
In other words, there's an infinity or negative
236:18 - infinity somewhere in the bounds of integration.
So the first example, is a type one improper
236:27 - integral. A type two improper integral occurs
when the function that we're integrating itself
236:34 - has an infinite discontinuity on the interval.
by an infinite discontinuity, I mean the function
236:42 - is going to infinity or negative infinity,
this is also called a vertical asymptote.
236:44 - This vertical asymptote could occur in the
interior of the interval we're integrating
236:50 - over. Or, as in this example, it could occur
on the endpoint of that interval of integration.
237:00 - Now, it's possible that both of these situations
could occur for the same integral. And that's
237:07 - also an improper integral. This video will
focus on type one improper integrals. A type
237:11 - one improper integral, asks us to integrate
over an infinite interval. To do this, we
237:16 - take the integral over larger and larger finite
intervals and take the limit. So for example,
237:19 - to find the integral from one to infinity
of one over x squared dx, we'll evaluate the
237:22 - integral from one to some finite number T,
and then take the limit as t goes off to infinity.
237:27 - In symbols, we can write the limit as t goes
to infinity of the integral from one to T
237:30 - of one over x squared dx. Since one over x
squared is the same thing as x to the minus
237:36 - two, we can integrate it to get negative x
to the minus one evaluated between one and
237:45 - T, and then take that limit or rewrite this
as negative one over x and evaluate on the
237:51 - bounds of integration. as t goes to infinity,
one over t goes to zero. So the limit just
237:58 - comes from this expression, which evaluates
to one. If we think of it, the integral is
238:04 - representing area, this is a little surprising.
Even though we're taking the area of an infinitely
238:09 - long region, the area still evaluates to a
finite number of one. In this situation, we
238:16 - say that the improper integral converges.
So in general, the improper integral from
238:25 - some finite number a to infinity of f of x
dx is defined as the limit as t goes to infinity
238:34 - of the integral from a to T of f of x dx.
We say that the integral converges if this
238:47 - limit exists as a finite number. And we say
that the integral diverges if the limit is
238:55 - infinity, or negative infinity, or if it doesn't
exist. Similarly, we evaluate the integral
239:01 - from negative infinity to some finite number
by taking bigger and bigger intervals that
239:06 - extend off to negative infinity. That is,
this integral is defined as the limit as the
239:14 - left endpoint t goes to negative infinity
of the integral from t to b of f of x dx.
239:20 - We say that this integral converges if the
limit exists as a finite number, and diverges
239:28 - otherwise. So to evaluate the integral from
negative infinity to negative one of one over
239:36 - x dx, we take the limit as t goes to negative
infinity
239:43 - of the integral from t to negative one of
one over x dx. Now the integral of one over
239:51 - x is ln of the absolute value of x, which
will need to integrate between t and negative
240:00 - one and take a limit. We evaluate here we
know that ln of the absolute value of negative
240:06 - one, that's ln of one which is zero. A graph
of ln is helpful for evaluating the rest of
240:17 - this expression. as t goes to negative infinity,
the absolute value of t is going to infinity.
240:24 - And so ln is also going to infinity. Therefore,
our limit is actually negative infinity, and
240:32 - so the integral diverges. In this video, we
evaluated improper integrals Which the interval
240:36 - that we're integrating over is infinite by
looking at the integrals over larger and larger,
240:41 - finite intervals and taking a limit. This
video is about type two improper integrals.
240:47 - These are integrals for which the interval
that we're integrating over is finite. But
240:51 - the function that we're integrating goes to
infinity on that interval. To integrate a
240:54 - type to improper integral like this one, or
this one, we integrate our function over a
240:59 - larger and larger sub intervals on which the
function is finite. And then we take a limit.
241:04 - So in this first picture, where the function
approaches infinity, as x goes to be from
241:09 - the left, we can call that moving endpoint
T. and evaluate the integral as the limit
241:14 - as that right endpoint t approaches B from
the left of the integral from a to T of f
241:23 - of x dx. The same definition works if f of
x is going to negative infinity instead of
241:35 - infinity. In the second picture here, we again
want to take a limit of integrals over sub
241:44 - intervals on which the function is finite.
So in symbols, that says that if f goes to
241:50 - infinity or negative infinity, as x goes to
a from the positive side, then the integral
241:56 - from a to b of f of x dx is going to be the
limit as t goes to a from the right of the
242:06 - integral from t to b of f of x dx. As an example,
let's find the area under the curve y equals
242:14 - x over the square root of x squared minus
one between the lines of x equals one and
242:20 - x equals two. That area can be described as
the integral from one to two of our function.
242:27 - But this is an improper integral, because
the function is going to infinity, as x goes
242:31 - to one from the right. So we'll evaluate it
by taking the limit as t goes to one from
242:39 - the right of the integral from t to two of
the function. I'll compute this integral using
242:47 - u substitution, where u is x squared minus
one, and d u is 2x dx. Since I see an x dx,
242:59 - in my integrand, here, I'll solve for x dx,
and I get x dx is equal to one half deal.
243:03 - I'm also going to change my bounds of integration,
when x is equal to t. That means u is equal
243:12 - to t squared minus one. And when x is equal
to two, u is two squared minus one, that's
243:19 - three. So I'll rewrite my integral x dx is
the same thing as one half d u, and my square
243:30 - root of x squared minus one becomes a square
root of u in the denominator. Rewrite again,
243:38 - by pulling the one half out of the integral
and rewriting the square root of u in the
243:43 - denominator as u to the negative one half.
Now I can integrate, I get two times you to
243:50 - the one half evaluated between three and t
squared minus one, my one half and two cancel,
243:55 - and I'll plug in my bounds of integration
here. Now, as t goes to one from the right,
244:01 - t squared is also going to one, so t squared
minus one is going to zero.
244:09 - of the integral from t to negative one of
one over x dx. Now the integral of one over
244:15 - x is ln of the absolute value of x, which
will need to integrate between t and negative
244:21 - one and take a limit. We evaluate here we
know that ln of the absolute value of negative
244:27 - one, that's ln of one which is zero. A graph
of ln is helpful for evaluating the rest of
244:33 - this expression. as t goes to negative infinity,
the absolute value of t is going to infinity.
244:39 - And so ln is also going to infinity. Therefore,
our limit is actually negative infinity, and
244:45 - so the integral diverges. In this video, we
evaluated improper integrals Which the interval
244:51 - that we're integrating over is infinite by
looking at the integrals over larger and larger,
245:01 - finite intervals and taking a limit. This
video is about type two improper integrals.
245:09 - These are integrals for which the interval
that we're integrating over is finite. But
245:17 - the function that we're integrating goes to
infinity on that interval. To integrate a
245:21 - type to improper integral like this one, or
this one, we integrate our function over a
245:29 - larger and larger sub intervals on which the
function is finite. And then we take a limit.
245:41 - So in this first picture, where the function
approaches infinity, as x goes to be from
245:46 - the left, we can call that moving endpoint
T. and evaluate the integral as the limit
245:57 - as that right endpoint t approaches B from
the left of the integral from a to T of f
246:03 - of x dx. The same definition works if f of
x is going to negative infinity instead of
246:11 - infinity. In the second picture here, we again
want to take a limit of integrals over sub
246:19 - intervals on which the function is finite.
So in symbols, that says that if f goes to
246:24 - infinity or negative infinity, as x goes to
a from the positive side, then the integral
246:28 - from a to b of f of x dx is going to be the
limit as t goes to a from the right of the
246:34 - integral from t to b of f of x dx. As an example,
let's find the area under the curve y equals
246:43 - x over the square root of x squared minus
one between the lines of x equals one and
246:55 - x equals two. That area can be described as
the integral from one to two of our function.
247:05 - But this is an improper integral, because
the function is going to infinity, as x goes
247:13 - to one from the right. So we'll evaluate it
by taking the limit as t goes to one from
247:21 - the right of the integral from t to two of
the function. I'll compute this integral using
247:28 - u substitution, where u is x squared minus
one, and d u is 2x dx. Since I see an x dx,
247:38 - in my integrand, here, I'll solve for x dx,
and I get x dx is equal to one half deal.
247:47 - I'm also going to change my bounds of integration,
when x is equal to t. That means u is equal
247:53 - to t squared minus one. And when x is equal
to two, u is two squared minus one, that's
248:02 - three. So I'll rewrite my integral x dx is
the same thing as one half d u, and my square
248:14 - root of x squared minus one becomes a square
root of u in the denominator. Rewrite again,
248:31 - by pulling the one half out of the integral
and rewriting the square root of u in the
248:42 - denominator as u to the negative one half.
Now I can integrate, I get two times you to
248:57 - the one half evaluated between three and t
squared minus one, my one half and two cancel,
249:04 - and I'll plug in my bounds of integration
here. Now, as t goes to one from the right,
249:13 - t squared is also going to one, so t squared
minus one is going to zero.
249:18 - Therefore, my limit is just three to the one
half, or square root of three. And that's
249:23 - the area underneath my curve. This video was
about type two improper integrals, and how
249:26 - to compute them as the limit of integrals
over larger and larger sub intervals on which
249:30 - the function is finite. Sometimes we don't
really care what the value of an improper
249:32 - integral is, we just want to know whether
it's finite or infinite, whether it converges
249:33 - or diverges. In this situation, the comparison
theorem can be very handy. The comparison
249:34 - theorem can allow us to determine if an integral
converges or diverges without actually having
249:39 - to evaluate the integral instead by comparing
it to the integral of a function that we know
249:46 - converges or diverges. So suppose that g of
x and f of x are both positive valued functions.
249:52 - They're both greater than zero for all x's
on the interval A B. And let's suppose also
249:59 - that g of x is less than f of x on that interval
a, b. here, A or B could be infinity or negative
250:09 - infinity. So in the picture, we'll call this
blue function, g of x, and the orange function,
250:16 - f of x. And let's consider the interval from
one to infinity, where g of x is less than
250:20 - f of x, and both of them are bigger than zero.
Now, if we already know that the integral
250:27 - of f of x on this interval converges to a
finite number, then g of x, which is less
250:34 - than f of x also has to converge to a finite
number. So if the integral of f of x converges,
250:42 - then g of x converges. If we turn this around,
we can say that if g of x diverges, so it
250:51 - doesn't converge to a finite number, then
f of x has to diverged also. So in the situation
251:02 - where the integral of the bigger function
converges, or the integral of the smaller
251:13 - function diverges, then we can make some conclusions
about the integral the other function, but
251:20 - you have to be a little careful about this.
Because if instead, the integral of the bigger
251:25 - function diverges, then we really can't make
any conclusions at all about the integral
251:32 - of the smaller function, it could also diverged
or it could be small enough to converge as
251:40 - similarly, if the integral of the smaller
function converges, then we really just don't
251:44 - know anything about the integral of the bigger
function, it could converge, or it could divert.
251:48 - Let's look at an example. Suppose we want
to find out if the integral from two to infinity
251:53 - of two plus sine x over square root of x dx
converges or diverges. Instead of trying to
252:02 - evaluate it, which could get tricky, because
of the sine x and the square root of x in
252:10 - here, I'm going to just try to compare it
to something that I know converges or diverges.
252:17 - The first thing that I notice is that sine
of x is bounded. It's always between one and
252:25 - negative one. And that means that the numerator
two plus sine x is always going to be in between
252:31 - three and one. Therefore, the function two
plus sine x over square root of x is going
252:39 - to be between three over square root of x
and one over square root of x. Here's the
252:43 - general idea of the picture. Now the comparison
theorem tells us that if our function is less
252:57 - than a function whose interval converges,
then the integral of our current function
253:01 - will converge. And if our function is greater
than a function whose integral diverges than
253:06 - the integral of our function will diverged.
So which one of these two inequalities if
253:12 - we want to use depends on what happens to
the integral of these functions on the ends?
253:19 - Now we know that the integral of one over
the square root of x dx from two to infinity
253:27 - has to die verge. That's because this is a
p function, where p is equal to one half,
253:33 - which is less than one, the integral from
two to infinity of three over the square root
253:43 - of x dx also diverges since it's just three
times the other integral. So if we want to
253:57 - compare our function to a function whose integral
diverges, it It better be bigger than that
254:03 - divergent integral in order to get any useful
information out of it being less than a function
254:09 - whose integral diverges doesn't tell us anything.
So we need to focus on this inequality.
254:14 - Therefore, my limit is just three to the one
half, or square root of three. And that's
254:20 - the area underneath my curve. This video was
about type two improper integrals, and how
254:24 - to compute them as the limit of integrals
over larger and larger sub intervals on which
254:30 - the function is finite. Sometimes we don't
really care what the value of an improper
254:38 - integral is, we just want to know whether
it's finite or infinite, whether it converges
254:47 - or diverges. In this situation, the comparison
theorem can be very handy. The comparison
254:50 - theorem can allow us to determine if an integral
converges or diverges without actually having
254:55 - to evaluate the integral instead by comparing
it to the integral of a function that we know
255:02 - converges or diverges. So suppose that g of
x and f of x are both positive valued functions.
255:08 - They're both greater than zero for all x's
on the interval A B. And let's suppose also
255:15 - that g of x is less than f of x on that interval
a, b. here, A or B could be infinity or negative
255:27 - infinity. So in the picture, we'll call this
blue function, g of x, and the orange function,
255:34 - f of x. And let's consider the interval from
one to infinity, where g of x is less than
255:44 - f of x, and both of them are bigger than zero.
Now, if we already know that the integral
255:51 - of f of x on this interval converges to a
finite number, then g of x, which is less
256:02 - than f of x also has to converge to a finite
number. So if the integral of f of x converges,
256:16 - then g of x converges. If we turn this around,
we can say that if g of x diverges, so it
256:26 - doesn't converge to a finite number, then
f of x has to diverged also. So in the situation
256:42 - where the integral of the bigger function
converges, or the integral of the smaller
256:49 - function diverges, then we can make some conclusions
about the integral the other function, but
256:55 - you have to be a little careful about this.
Because if instead, the integral of the bigger
257:01 - function diverges, then we really can't make
any conclusions at all about the integral
257:06 - of the smaller function, it could also diverged
or it could be small enough to converge as
257:13 - similarly, if the integral of the smaller
function converges, then we really just don't
257:17 - know anything about the integral of the bigger
function, it could converge, or it could divert.
257:23 - Let's look at an example. Suppose we want
to find out if the integral from two to infinity
257:30 - of two plus sine x over square root of x dx
converges or diverges. Instead of trying to
257:39 - evaluate it, which could get tricky, because
of the sine x and the square root of x in
257:48 - here, I'm going to just try to compare it
to something that I know converges or diverges.
257:57 - The first thing that I notice is that sine
of x is bounded. It's always between one and
258:05 - negative one. And that means that the numerator
two plus sine x is always going to be in between
258:11 - three and one. Therefore, the function two
plus sine x over square root of x is going
258:18 - to be between three over square root of x
and one over square root of x. Here's the
258:26 - general idea of the picture. Now the comparison
theorem tells us that if our function is less
258:34 - than a function whose interval converges,
then the integral of our current function
258:42 - will converge. And if our function is greater
than a function whose integral diverges than
258:47 - the integral of our function will diverged.
So which one of these two inequalities if
258:54 - we want to use depends on what happens to
the integral of these functions on the ends?
259:02 - Now we know that the integral of one over
the square root of x dx from two to infinity
259:18 - has to die verge. That's because this is a
p function, where p is equal to one half,
259:28 - which is less than one, the integral from
two to infinity of three over the square root
259:32 - of x dx also diverges since it's just three
times the other integral. So if we want to
259:36 - compare our function to a function whose integral
diverges, it It better be bigger than that
259:40 - divergent integral in order to get any useful
information out of it being less than a function
259:46 - whose integral diverges doesn't tell us anything.
So we need to focus on this inequality.
259:54 - And now we can say that, since the integral
from two to infinity of one over the square
260:00 - root of x dx diverges by the P test, the integral
of our function also diverges by the comparison
260:07 - test. In this video, we saw that if we have
two positive functions, and one function is
260:13 - always less than or equal to the other function
on an interval, then if the smaller functions
260:18 - integral diverges, the bigger functions integral
also has to diverge. And if the Biggers functions
260:24 - integral converges, the smaller functions
integral also has to converge. That's the
260:28 - comparison there. In this video, I'll give
some definitions and notation for sequences.
260:33 - A sequence is a list of numbers in a particular
order, the sequence 314159 and So on is a
260:42 - sequence that gives the digits of pi. A sequence
is sometimes described abstractly, with letters
260:48 - in place of numbers, a sub one, a sub two,
a sub three, and so on. Or more concisely,
261:07 - by writing a sub n with these curly brackets.
Here, we're told that the index n ranges from
261:14 - one all the way up towards infinity. Sometimes
the sequence is written just a sub n with
261:19 - curly brackets. Here, it's implied that n
ranges through all positive integers. For
261:26 - these sequences, given by formulas, let's
write out the first few terms. We start with
261:36 - n equals one, and we get a sub one is three
times one plus one over one plus two factorial.
261:47 - That is, for over three factorial. Recall
that three factorial means that we start with
261:56 - three and then multiply with consecutive numbers
all the way down to one, this simplifies to
262:06 - four, six, or two thirds. To find the next
term, a sub two, we plug in two for add, that's
262:17 - seven over four factorial, which is 720 fourths.
Similarly, a sub three is 10, over five factorial,
262:25 - which is 10 over 120, or 112. So the first
three terms of the sequence are two thirds,
262:33 - 720, fourths, and 112. For the second example,
we're asked to start with K equals two. So
262:42 - I'll call the first term, a sub two, and just
plug in two for K, which is five ninths. Since
262:49 - negative one squared is positive one. Plugging
in K equals three, we get negative 6/27, or
262:57 - to negative two nights. For as of four, we
again get a positive number, since negative
262:59 - one to the fourth is positive. And in fact,
as we keep writing down terms, they're going
263:04 - to alternate between negative numbers and
positive numbers, because of the negative
263:06 - one to the K in the definition. Sometimes,
the nth term of a sequence is defined indirectly,
263:16 - in terms of previous terms. This is called
a recursive formula. To write out the first
263:22 - few terms of this recursive sequence, we're
told that a sub one equals two, to find a
263:27 - sub two, we just use the recursive formula
for minus one over a sub one. Since a sub
263:32 - one is two, that's four minus a half, or seven
half, defined a sub three, we just apply the
263:39 - recursive formula again, four minus one over
seven has simplifies to 26/7. Sometimes as
263:41 - possible, describe a sequence with either
a recursive formula, or a closed form non
263:46 - recursive formula. For example, if I look
at the sequence 246 810, I can describe that
263:52 - recursively by saying a sub one is two, and
each a sub n is equal to a sub n minus one
264:02 - plus two. Or I can describe as a closed form
expression by saying the sequence is of the
264:12 - form two times n, where n starts at one.
264:14 - And now we can say that, since the integral
from two to infinity of one over the square
264:19 - root of x dx diverges by the P test, the integral
of our function also diverges by the comparison
264:28 - test. In this video, we saw that if we have
two positive functions, and one function is
264:38 - always less than or equal to the other function
on an interval, then if the smaller functions
264:44 - integral diverges, the bigger functions integral
also has to diverge. And if the Biggers functions
264:53 - integral converges, the smaller functions
integral also has to converge. That's the
265:01 - comparison there. In this video, I'll give
some definitions and notation for sequences.
265:07 - A sequence is a list of numbers in a particular

266:43 - I'll call the first term, a sub two, and just

267:51 - possible, describe a sequence with either
a recursive formula, or a closed form non
267:58 - recursive formula. For example, if I look
at the sequence 246 810, I can describe that
268:05 - recursively by saying a sub one is two, and
each a sub n is equal to a sub n minus one
268:15 - plus two. Or I can describe as a closed form
expression by saying the sequence is of the
268:23 - form two times n, where n starts at one.
268:27 - Now let's practice writing out a formula for
the general term, a sub n of a sequence. For
268:33 - this first sequence, notice that each term
is three more than the previous term. So this
268:40 - is like a linear function with slope three,
each time that n goes up by one, our ace events
268:48 - go up by three. And so I can write a sub n
is three times n plus b, where B functions
268:57 - like my y intercept and a linear equation,
to find B, I can plug in seven, four, a sub
269:06 - one that corresponds to an N value of one,
and I get that B has to equal four. So my
269:15 - general formula is three times n plus four,
where n starts at one. I can check this by
269:23 - plugging in a few values of n, like we did
in the previous example, just to make sure
269:31 - it works. Notice that it would also be possible
to write this as three times n plus seven
269:38 - If we're willing to start with n equals zero
instead of one, if we let n start with zero,
269:45 - then our first term functions like our y intercept.
This is an example of an arithmetic sequence,
269:56 - a sequence for which consecutive terms have
the same common difference. And in general,
270:03 - if A is the first term, and d is the common
difference than an arithmetic sequence has
270:13 - the form d times k plus a, if our index is
K and starts at zero, like it did over here.
270:23 - Or if we'd rather start with an index of one,
we can rewrite that as D times n minus one
270:33 - plus a. Notice these two expressions are exactly
the same, if we just set k equal to n minus
270:40 - one, in particular, the starting value of
n equals one here, if I plug in one for n,
270:46 - I get the equivalent starting value of K to
be zero. Let's read some more formulas for
270:53 - sequences. In this first sequence, notice
that consecutive terms always have the same
270:57 - ratio of 1/10. In other words, each time n
increases by one, a sub n gets multiplied
271:04 - by 1/10. This is the same property that exponential
functions have. And in fact, we can write
271:11 - a sub n in the form of an exponential function
with base 1/10. But we need to multiply by
271:22 - the right initial value, so that when n is
one, we'll get a first term of three, that
271:34 - correct initial value is 30. As usual, we
can check our answer by plugging in a few
271:46 - values of n, n equals 123. And making sure
we get back the terms in our sequence. If
271:53 - we prefer to start with our index at zero,
we can rewrite this as three times 1/10 to
272:02 - the nth power. Since a value of zero for n
in this formula, gives us three, just like
272:08 - a value of one for n in this formula gives
us three. In the second example, we again
272:19 - have a common ratio, if I divide the second
term by the first term, I get a ratio of five
272:33 - halves. And that's the same ratio as I get
when I divide the third term by the second
272:46 - term. So if I use an index starting with zero,
I can write this series as 15 halves, which
272:56 - is the first term times five halves to the
nth power. If I prefer to start with my index
273:04 - at one, one way to do this is to let K equal
n plus one and making a variable substitution.
273:12 - When n is 0k, will be one. And since K is
n plus one, n is k minus one, so I can replace
273:20 - n with k minus one. This gives the following
representation of the sequence. The third
273:26 - example has a common ratio of negative two
thirds. so we can write it as the initial
273:32 - term of three times that ratio, negative two
thirds raised to the nth power, where n starts
273:38 - at zero. Or, as above, we can write it as
three times negative two thirds to the k minus
273:42 - one.
273:43 - Now let's practice writing out a formula for
the general term, a sub n of a sequence. For
273:51 - this first sequence, notice that each term
is three more than the previous term. So this
273:56 - is like a linear function with slope three,
each time that n goes up by one, our ace events
274:05 - go up by three. And so I can write a sub n
is three times n plus b, where B functions
274:15 - like my y intercept and a linear equation,
to find B, I can plug in seven, four, a sub
274:22 - one that corresponds to an N value of one,
and I get that B has to equal four. So my
274:27 - general formula is three times n plus four,
where n starts at one. I can check this by
274:33 - plugging in a few values of n, like we did
in the previous example, just to make sure
274:38 - it works. Notice that it would also be possible
to write this as three times n plus seven
274:44 - If we're willing to start with n equals zero
instead of one, if we let n start with zero,
274:51 - then our first term functions like our y intercept.
This is an example of an arithmetic sequence,
274:59 - a sequence for which consecutive terms have
the same common difference. And in general,
275:03 - if A is the first term, and d is the common
difference than an arithmetic sequence has
275:11 - the form d times k plus a, if our index is
K and starts at zero, like it did over here.
275:21 - Or if we'd rather start with an index of one,
we can rewrite that as D times n minus one
275:32 - plus a. Notice these two expressions are exactly
the same, if we just set k equal to n minus
275:42 - one, in particular, the starting value of
n equals one here, if I plug in one for n,
275:52 - I get the equivalent starting value of K to
be zero. Let's read some more formulas for
276:00 - sequences. In this first sequence, notice
that consecutive terms always have the same
276:10 - ratio of 1/10. In other words, each time n
increases by one, a sub n gets multiplied
276:16 - by 1/10. This is the same property that exponential
functions have. And in fact, we can write
276:24 - a sub n in the form of an exponential function
with base 1/10. But we need to multiply by
276:28 - the right initial value, so that when n is
one, we'll get a first term of three, that
276:35 - correct initial value is 30. As usual, we
can check our answer by plugging in a few
276:41 - values of n, n equals 123. And making sure
we get back the terms in our sequence. If
276:47 - we prefer to start with our index at zero,
we can rewrite this as three times 1/10 to
276:50 - the nth power. Since a value of zero for n
in this formula, gives us three, just like
277:01 - a value of one for n in this formula gives
us three. In the second example, we again
277:07 - have a common ratio, if I divide the second
term by the first term, I get a ratio of five
277:15 - halves. And that's the same ratio as I get
when I divide the third term by the second
277:20 - term. So if I use an index starting with zero,
I can write this series as 15 halves, which
277:27 - is the first term times five halves to the
nth power. If I prefer to start with my index
277:33 - at one, one way to do this is to let K equal
n plus one and making a variable substitution.
277:42 - When n is 0k, will be one. And since K is
n plus one, n is k minus one, so I can replace
277:54 - n with k minus one. This gives the following
representation of the sequence. The third
278:06 - example has a common ratio of negative two
thirds. so we can write it as the initial
278:12 - term of three times that ratio, negative two
thirds raised to the nth power, where n starts
278:18 - at zero. Or, as above, we can write it as
three times negative two thirds to the k minus
278:25 - one.
278:26 - Where k starts at one. Sometimes people like
to write the negative one separately. The
278:32 - negative one to the power makes a series alternate
between negative and positive terms. These
278:38 - three sequences are all examples of geometric
sequences, which are key sequences where consecutive
278:44 - terms have the same common ratio. And in general,
if A is the first term and RS, the common
278:51 - ratio than a geometric sequence can be written
in the form of a times r to the n, where n
278:56 - starts at zero, or as a times r to the n minus
one, where n starts at one. These next two
279:03 - sequences are neither arithmetic sequences
nor geometric sequences. Since they're terms
279:07 - neither have common differences nor common
ratios, but I can still figure out a formula
279:11 - for the nth term just by looking for the pattern.
In this example, since the terms are alternating,
279:18 - if I start at n equals one, I know that 90
to negative one to the nth power to make it
279:25 - start with a negative and then alternate,
positive, negative Again, the numerator looks
279:30 - like it's just twice n. And the denominator
looks like it's always a perfect square, starting
279:36 - with the square of three, so I'll write that
as n plus two squared. The next sequence doesn't
279:41 - have a simple closed form formula, but I can
describe it recursively by saying that a one
279:46 - is negative six, a two is five. And in general,
a n is equal to the sum of the two previous
279:53 - terms, a sub n minus one, plus a sub n minus
two. This sequence is closely related to the
280:00 - standard Fibonacci sequence, which has the
same recursive formula, but different initial
280:03 - values. This video gave an introduction to
sequences, including arithmetic sequences,
280:07 - geometric sequences, and recursively defined
sequences. This video introduces the idea
280:10 - of a series and how to find it sum. For any
sequence, a sub n for n equals one to infinity,
280:17 - the sum of its terms, a sub one plus a sub
two plus a sub three, and so on, it's called
280:27 - a series. Often this series is written in
sigma notation, as a sum from n equals one
280:32 - to infinity of a sub n. Let's look at the
sequence one over two to the n for n equals
280:39 - one to infinity. If we add together all the
terms, we get the series, the sum from n equals
280:48 - one to infinity of one over two to the N,
that is the sum of one over two to the one,
280:56 - that's one half, plus one over two squared,
that's 1/4, plus one over two cubed 1/8 plus
281:02 - 1/16, plus 1/32, and so on. But what does
it really mean to add have infinitely many
281:11 - numbers? How can we figure out what this infinite
song equals? Well, the start out, we could
281:19 - add up finitely, many at a time, may write
down the first half dozen or so terms, that
281:25 - is the ace of ends. And I'll keep adding more
and more of them together one more at a time.
281:37 - But just add the first term, well, that's
just one half. Now add the next term on, that
281:43 - gives me a song of three fourths. If I add
1/8 to that, my son goes up to seven eights.
281:49 - And then I'll add the next one. I get 15 sixteenths,
and so on just adding one more term each time.
281:55 - This process of repeated addition gives me
a new sequence down at the bottom. That's
282:00 - called the sequence of partial sums. And it's
usually denoted by s sub n. So the first term
282:07 - in the sequence of partial sums as S sub one,
just adding together the first term, here's
282:13 - the second partial sum S sub two, adding together
the first two terms. So three means add together,
282:21 - the first three terms, and so on. Let me contrast
the sequence of partial sums with the sequence
282:29 - of terms that we started out with. Those are
denoted a sub n. So here's a sub one, the
282:36 - first term, a sub two, the second term, and
so on.
282:42 - Where k starts at one. Sometimes people like
to write the negative one separately. The
282:48 - negative one to the power makes a series alternate
between negative and positive terms. These
282:55 - three sequences are all examples of geometric
sequences, which are key sequences where consecutive
282:58 - terms have the same common ratio. And in general,
if A is the first term and RS, the common
283:02 - ratio than a geometric sequence can be written
in the form of a times r to the n, where n
283:10 - starts at zero, or as a times r to the n minus
one, where n starts at one. These next two
283:21 - sequences are neither arithmetic sequences
nor geometric sequences. Since they're terms
283:25 - neither have common differences nor common
ratios, but I can still figure out a formula
283:31 - for the nth term just by looking for the pattern.
In this example, since the terms are alternating,
283:38 - if I start at n equals one, I know that 90
to negative one to the nth power to make it
283:46 - start with a negative and then alternate,
positive, negative Again, the numerator looks
283:50 - like it's just twice n. And the denominator
looks like it's always a perfect square, starting
283:55 - with the square of three, so I'll write that
as n plus two squared. The next sequence doesn't
284:00 - have a simple closed form formula, but I can
describe it recursively by saying that a one
284:03 - is negative six, a two is five. And in general,
a n is equal to the sum of the two previous
284:10 - terms, a sub n minus one, plus a sub n minus
two. This sequence is closely related to the
284:13 - standard Fibonacci sequence, which has the
same recursive formula, but different initial
284:18 - values. This video gave an introduction to
sequences, including arithmetic sequences,
284:22 - geometric sequences, and recursively defined
sequences. This video introduces the idea
284:24 - of a series and how to find it sum. For any
sequence, a sub n for n equals one to infinity,
284:38 - the sum of its terms, a sub one plus a sub
two plus a sub three, and so on, it's called
284:45 - a series. Often this series is written in
sigma notation, as a sum from n equals one
284:53 - to infinity of a sub n. Let's look at the
sequence one over two to the n for n equals
285:05 - one to infinity. If we add together all the
terms, we get the series, the sum from n equals
285:11 - one to infinity of one over two to the N,
that is the sum of one over two to the one,
285:22 - that's one half, plus one over two squared,
that's 1/4, plus one over two cubed 1/8 plus
285:28 - 1/16, plus 1/32, and 
so on. But what does it really mean to add
285:40 - have infinitely many numbers? How can we figure
out what this infinite song equals? Well,
285:47 - the start out, we could add up finitely, many
at a time, may write down the first half dozen
285:53 - or so terms, that is the ace of ends. And
I'll keep adding more and more of them together
285:57 - one more at a time. But just add the first
term, well, that's just one half. Now add
286:04 - the next term on, that gives me a song of
three fourths. If I add 1/8 to that, my son
286:09 - goes up to seven eights. And then I'll add
the next one. I get 15 sixteenths, and so
286:15 - on just adding one more term each time. This
process of repeated addition gives me a new
286:22 - sequence down at the bottom. That's called
the sequence of partial sums. And it's usually
286:28 - denoted by s sub n. So the first term in the
sequence of partial sums as S sub one, just
286:33 - adding together the first term, here's the
second partial sum S sub two, adding together
286:38 - the first two terms. So three means add together,
the first three terms, and so on. Let me contrast
286:46 - the sequence of partial sums with the sequence
of terms that we started out with. Those are
286:47 - denoted a sub n. So here's a sub one, the
first term, a sub two, the second term, and
286:52 - so on.
286:53 - Although I can't physically add up infinitely
many numbers, I can observe that as I add
286:58 - up more and more numbers, my partial sums
are approaching the number one. That is the
287:02 - limit, as the number of terms I add up and
goes to infinity of the nth partial sum is
287:06 - equal to one. So it makes sense that if I
could add up all infinitely many numbers,
287:10 - I should get an exact sum of one, the sum
of this infinite series is one. In fact, for
287:14 - this particular series, there's a nice way
to see that the sum is one using geometry.
287:20 - If I draw a square with side length one and
fill in half of the square, that gives me
287:26 - an area of one half. Now if I draw a line
here, that gives me an additional area of
287:31 - 1/4. Here's an area of 1/8 1/16 and I keep
spiraling in here. I keep adding areas that
287:37 - exactly match the terms of this series. In
the limit, I'll have filled in the entire
287:40 - R square, which has an area of one. In this
example, which found the sum of the series
287:44 - by evaluating the limit of the partial sums.
And in general, this is how we find the sum
287:51 - of any series. For any series, the partial
sums of the series are defined as the sequence
287:54 - s sub n, where S sub one is equal to just
the first term, a sub one, a sub two is equal
287:58 - to the sum of the first two terms is a one
plus a sub two, a sub three is a sum of the
288:05 - first three terms. And in general, s sub n
is the sum of the first n terms. I can also
288:10 - write this in sigma notation, as the sum of
say, k equals one to n of a sub k. I'm using
288:18 - a different letter K here as the index, just
because I'm already using n to represent the
288:25 - number of terms that I'm adding up. That sum
of a sub n is said to converge if this sequence
288:33 - of partial sums converges as a sequence. That
is, if the limit as n goes to infinity of
288:40 - the sub ends, exists as a finite number. Otherwise,
if the limit does not exist, or the limit
288:53 - is infinity or negative infinity, then the
series is said to diverged. I want to emphasize
288:59 - that we're talking about the limit of the
partial sums here, not the limit of the original
289:05 - terms as a bad, it's important to keep in
mind when you're working with series that
289:17 - for any series, they're actually two sequences
of interest. There's the sequence of terms,
289:21 - the ace of ends. And then there's the sequence
of partial sums, the S events, it's the sequence
289:29 - of partial sums is telling us what the sum
of our series is. So if the sequence of partial
289:34 - sums converges to a number L, then we say
the cert series converges to L. Or in other
289:42 - words, the sum of the series is out. Let's
look at the series The sum of one over n squared
289:55 - plus n, please pause the video and take a
moment to write out the first four terms and
290:02 - the first four partial sums. The first four
terms are a sub one, a sub two, a sub three
290:08 - and a sub four. So plugging in one for n,
one over one squared plus one, so that's one
290:15 - half, a sub two is one over two squared plus
two, that's one six, Ace of three ends up
290:23 - being 1/12. And a sub four is 1/20. Now S
sub one is the sum of the first one terms,
290:33 - that's the same as a sub one is just one half
290:37 - Although I can't physically add up infinitely
many numbers, I can observe that as I add
290:46 - up more and more numbers, my partial sums
are approaching the number one. That is the
290:52 - limit, as the number of terms I add up and
goes to infinity of the nth partial sum is
291:00 - equal to one. So it makes sense that if I
could add up all infinitely many numbers,
291:07 - I should get an exact sum of one, the sum
of this infinite series is one. In fact, for
291:17 - this particular series, there's a nice way
to see that the sum is one using geometry.
291:22 - If I draw a square with side length one and
fill in half of the square, that gives me
291:26 - an area of one half. Now if I draw a line
here, that gives me an additional area of
291:32 - 1/4. Here's an area of 1/8 1/16 and I keep
spiraling in here. I keep adding areas that
291:39 - exactly match the terms of this series. In
the limit, I'll have filled in the entire
291:44 - R square, which has an area of one. In this
example, which found the sum of the series
291:51 - by evaluating the limit of the partial sums.
And in general, this is how we find the sum
292:00 - of any series. For any series, the partial
sums of the series are defined as the sequence
292:08 - s sub n, where S sub one is equal to just
the first term, a sub one, a sub two is equal
292:16 - to the sum of the first two terms is a one
plus a sub two, a sub three is a sum of the
292:25 - first three terms. And in general, s sub n
is the sum of the first n terms. I can also
292:34 - write this in sigma notation, as the sum of
say, k equals one to n of a sub k. I'm using
292:45 - a different letter K here as the index, just
because I'm already using n to represent the
292:53 - number of terms that I'm adding up. That sum
of a sub n is said to converge if this sequence
293:01 - of partial sums converges as a sequence. That
is, if the limit as n goes to infinity of
293:07 - the sub ends, exists as a finite number. Otherwise,
if the limit does not exist, or the limit
293:14 - is infinity or negative infinity, then the
series is said to diverged. I want to emphasize
293:21 - that we're talking about the limit of the
partial sums here, not the limit of the original
293:26 - terms as a bad, it's important to keep in
mind when you're working with series that
293:33 - for any series, they're actually two sequences
of interest. There's the sequence of terms,
293:38 - the ace of ends. And then there's the sequence
of partial sums, the S events, it's the sequence
293:45 - of partial sums is telling us what the sum
of our series is. So if the sequence of partial
293:52 - sums converges to a number L, then we say
the cert series converges to L. Or in other
294:02 - words, the sum of the series is out. Let's
look at the series The sum of one over n squared
294:08 - plus n, please pause the video and take a
moment to write out the first four terms and
294:15 - the first four partial sums. The first four
terms are a sub one, a sub two, a sub three
294:22 - and a sub four. So plugging in one for n,
one over one squared plus one, so that's one
294:31 - half, a sub two is one over two squared plus
two, that's one six, Ace of three ends up
294:42 - being 1/12. And a sub four is 1/20. Now S
sub one is the sum of the first one terms,
294:48 - that's the same as a sub one is just one half
294:52 - S sub two, is what I get when I add one half
plus one six, that's four, six, or two thirds.
295:00 - To get a sub three, I need to add on the next
term, two thirds plus 112, is 912, or three
295:09 - fourths. And finally, as sub four, I need
to add on the next term, which gives me four
295:15 - fifths. There's a nice pattern going on with
the S events here. For the nth partial song,
295:23 - the numerator is just n, and the denominator
is just n plus one. So the limit as n goes
295:28 - to infinity of the partial sums, is the limit
as n goes to infinity of n over n plus one,
295:37 - which is just one. That means that the sum
of the infinite series is equal to one, by
295:44 - coincidence the same sound as in the previous
example. In this video, we saw that to find
295:50 - the sum of an infinite series, we have to
calculate the partial sums. If we add together
295:59 - more and more finitely many terms, our partial
sum will get close to our infinite sum. And
296:10 - in fact, the sum of our infinite sum is defined
as the limit as n goes to infinity of the
296:19 - partial sum. This video gives some more definitions
about sequences, including the definition
296:28 - of bounded and the definition of monotonic
sequence is bounded above if all of its terms
296:35 - are less than or equal to some number in other
Words, there's a number capital M, such that
296:42 - the term a sub n is less than or equal to
capital M, for all values of the index n.
296:48 - A sequence is bounded below if all of its
terms are greater than or equal to some number.
296:55 - In other words, there's a number lowercase
m, such that a sub n is greater than or equal
297:03 - to lowercase m, for all and we say that a
sequence is bounded if it's bounded both above
297:09 - and below. In other words, all of its terms
are trapped between two numbers. Please pause
297:14 - the video and decide which of these three
sequences are bounded. This first sequence
297:18 - is bounded above by three. Since all of its
terms are less than or equal to three, of
297:26 - course, we could have also used four as an
upper bound, or 100 is an upper bound, but
297:32 - three is the tightest upper bound that we
can use. It's also bounded below by zero,
297:36 - since all of the terms are positive. So we
say that this sequence is bounded. The second
297:41 - sequence is bounded below by one, but it's
not bounded above, since its terms will eventually
297:46 - grow past any potential bound. The third sequence
is bounded below and above. In fact, if we
297:50 - graph n on the x axis and a sub n on the y
axis, then our terms bounce around between
297:59 - positive and negative values. But since we're
always multiplying by negative two thirds
298:04 - to get from one term to the next, the oscillations
are dying down in magnitude. And in fact,
298:12 - the terms can never get above three or below
negative two. We say that a sequence is increasing
298:20 - if each term is less than the next term, that
is, a sub n is less than a sub n plus one
298:29 - for all n. sequences called non decreasing
if each term is less than or equal to the
298:37 - next term. So a sub n is less than or equal
to a sub n plus one for all n. Non decreasing
298:42 - is like increasing, it's just we allow equality
between 2/6 consecutive terms
298:47 - S sub two, is what I get when I add one half
plus one six, that's four, six, or two thirds.
298:57 - To get a sub three, I need to add on the next
term, two thirds plus 112, is 912, or three
299:08 - fourths. And finally, as sub four, I need
to add on the next term, which gives me four
299:16 - fifths. There's a nice pattern going on with
the S events here. For the nth partial song,
299:25 - the numerator is just n, and the denominator
is just n plus one. So the limit as n goes
299:31 - to infinity of the partial sums, is the limit
as n goes to infinity of n over n plus one,
299:38 - which is just one. That means that the sum
of the infinite series is equal to one, by
299:42 - coincidence the same sound as in the previous
example. In this video, we saw that to find
299:50 - the sum of an infinite series, we have to
calculate the partial sums. If we add together
300:03 - more and more finitely many terms, our partial
sum will get close to our infinite sum. And
300:15 - in fact, the sum of our infinite sum is defined
as the limit as n goes to infinity of the
300:22 - partial sum. This video gives some more definitions
about sequences, including the definition
300:30 - of bounded and the definition of monotonic
sequence is bounded above if all of its terms
300:37 - are less than or equal to some number in other
Words, there's a number capital M, such that
300:46 - the term a sub n is less than or equal to
capital M, for all values of the index n.
300:53 - A sequence is bounded below if all of its
terms are greater than or equal to some number.
301:00 - In other words, there's a number lowercase
m, such that a sub n is greater than or equal
301:07 - to lowercase m, for all and we say that a
sequence is bounded if it's bounded both above
301:13 - and below. In other words, all of its terms
are trapped between two numbers. Please pause
301:18 - the video and decide which of these three
sequences are bounded. This first sequence
301:26 - is bounded above by three. Since all of its
terms are less than or equal to three, of
301:34 - course, we could have also used four as an
upper bound, or 100 is an upper bound, but
301:41 - three is the tightest upper bound that we
can use. It's also bounded below by zero,
301:48 - since all of the terms are positive. So we
say that this sequence is bounded. The second
301:55 - sequence is bounded below by one, but it's
not bounded above, since its terms will eventually
302:03 - grow past any potential bound. The third sequence
is bounded below and above. In fact, if we
302:13 - graph n on the x axis and a sub n on the y
axis, then our terms bounce around between
302:27 - positive and negative values. But since we're
always multiplying by negative two thirds
302:33 - to get from one term to the next, the oscillations
are dying down in magnitude. And in fact,
302:40 - the terms can never get above three or below
negative two. We say that a sequence is increasing
302:48 - if each term is less than the next term, that
is, a sub n is less than a sub n plus one
302:56 - for all n. sequences called non decreasing
if each term is less than or equal to the
303:05 - next term. So a sub n is less than or equal
to a sub n plus one for all n. Non decreasing
303:12 - is like increasing, it's just we allow equality
between 2/6 consecutive terms
303:15 - a sequence is decreasing if each term is greater
than the next one. So a sub n is greater than
303:23 - a sub n plus one for all n. And a sequence
is not increasing, if a sub n is greater than
303:31 - or equal to a sub n plus one for all n. Again,
not increasing is like decreasing, but we
303:40 - allow for equality between consecutive terms.
If we were to graph and on the x axis and
303:47 - a sub n on the y axis, then increasing looks
like this just like an increasing function,
303:53 - whereas decreasing would go down non decreasing
would go up possibly with some flat patches
303:58 - and mnandi increasing would go down possibly
with some flat patches, notice that increasing
304:05 - is a stronger condition than non decreasing
since being strictly less than something is
304:12 - stronger than just being less than or equal
to it. For that reason. If a sequence is increasing,
304:18 - it is also non decreasing. And similarly,
if a sequence is decreasing, it is also not
304:23 - increasing. A sequence is called monotonic,
if it is either non decreasing or non increasing.
304:28 - Please pause the video and try to decide which
of the following sequences are monotonic.
304:32 - The first two sequences are monotonic. The
first one is monotonically. Non increasing,
304:38 - since we never increase when we go from one
term to the next. In fact, we could also say
304:44 - that it's monotonically decreasing. Since
we always go strictly down as we go from one
304:48 - term to the next, we never have equality between
terms. The second sequence is monotonically
304:51 - non decreasing. Since we never go down, as
we go from one term to the next, we either
304:54 - go up or stay at the same level. In this case,
however, we could not say that the sequence
305:01 - is monotonically increasing because of the
equality between some pairs of consecutive
305:07 - terms. The third sequence is not monotonic,
the numbers bounce around between positive
305:13 - and negative numbers, and therefore sometimes
we are decreasing while other times we're
305:18 - increasing. And the fourth sequence is not
monotonic, because of the first few terms.
305:23 - However, from the fifth term on the terms
are monotonically, non decreasing. And we
305:31 - could also say monotonically increasing. In
this video, we give definitions for bounded
305:39 - and monotonic sequences. We'll see later that
these definitions can be important for determining
305:46 - when a sequence converges. In class, we talked
briefly about the sequence n minus five over
305:50 - n squared, where n goes from one to infinity.
We want to know if the sequence is monotonic.
305:58 - And if it's bounded. If we compute the first
few terms, the sequence appears to be steadily
306:06 - increasing. But in this case, appearances
are deceiving. And a better way to decide
306:10 - whether it's monotonic is to use calculus
to decide if the associated function f of
306:15 - x equals x minus five over x squared, it is
increasing for x values bigger than one. So
306:21 - let me take the derivative. Using the quotient
rule and simplify, I get that f prime of x
306:24 - is equal to minus x squared plus 10x over
x to the fourth. And now I need to decide
306:32 - is F prime of X greater than zero for x bigger
than one, if so my function, and therefore
306:39 - my sequence will, will be increasing. To check
if f prime of x 
306:51 - is greater than zero, I'll first set f prime
of x equal to zero. So I'll set my ratio here
307:01 - equal to zero, which means my numerator needs
to be equal to zero. And if I factor that,
307:08 - I get that x equals zero, or x equals 10.
307:12 - a sequence is decreasing if each term is greater
than the next one. So a sub n is greater than
307:21 - a sub n plus one for all n. And a sequence
is not increasing, if a sub n is greater than
307:31 - or equal to a sub n plus one for all n. Again,
not increasing is like decreasing, but we
307:50 - allow for equality between consecutive terms.
If we were to graph and on the x axis and
307:55 - a sub n on the y axis, then increasing looks
like this just like an increasing function,
308:04 - whereas decreasing would go down non decreasing
would go up possibly with some flat patches
308:10 - and mnandi increasing would go down possibly
with some flat patches, notice that increasing
308:16 - is a stronger condition than non decreasing
since being strictly less than something is
308:21 - stronger than just being less than or equal
to it. For that reason. If a sequence is increasing,
308:29 - it is also non decreasing. And similarly,
if a sequence is decreasing, it is also not
308:36 - increasing. A sequence is called monotonic,
if it is either non decreasing or non increasing.
308:43 - Please pause the video and try to decide which
of the following sequences are monotonic.
308:50 - The first two sequences are monotonic. The
first one is monotonically. Non increasing,
308:57 - since we never increase when we go from one
term to the next. In fact, we could also say
309:07 - that it's monotonically decreasing. Since
we always go strictly down as we go from one
309:13 - term to the next, we never have equality between
terms. The second sequence is monotonically
309:19 - non decreasing. Since we never go down, as
we go from one term to the next, we either
309:32 - go up or stay at the same level. In this case,
however, we could not say that the sequence
309:43 - is monotonically increasing because of the
equality between some pairs of consecutive
309:48 - terms. The third sequence is not monotonic,
the numbers bounce around between positive
309:51 - and negative numbers, and therefore sometimes
we are decreasing while other times we're
309:53 - increasing. And the fourth sequence is not
monotonic, because of the first few terms.
309:56 - However, from the fifth term on the terms
are monotonically, non decreasing. And we
310:02 - could also say monotonically increasing. In
this video, we give definitions for bounded
310:07 - and monotonic sequences. We'll see later that
these definitions can be important for determining
310:13 - when a sequence converges. In class, we talked
briefly about the sequence n minus five over
310:18 - n squared, where n goes from one to infinity.
We want to know if the sequence is monotonic.
310:23 - And if it's bounded. If we compute the first
few terms, the sequence appears to be steadily
310:30 - increasing. But in this case, appearances
are deceiving. And a better way to decide
310:36 - whether it's monotonic is to use calculus
to decide if the associated function f of
310:44 - x equals x minus five over x squared, it is
increasing for x values bigger than one. So
310:50 - let me take the derivative. Using the quotient
rule and simplify, I get that f prime of x
310:57 - is equal to minus x squared plus 10x over
x to the fourth. And now I need to decide
311:04 - is F prime of X greater than zero for x bigger
than one, if so my function, and therefore
311:14 - my sequence will, will be increasing. To check
if f prime of x is greater than zero, I'll
311:24 - first set f prime of x equal to zero. So I'll
set my ratio here equal to zero, which means
311:32 - my numerator needs to be equal to zero. And
if I factor that, I get that x equals zero,
311:38 - or x equals 10.
311:40 - Now if I draw my number line, since f prime
is equal to zero at zero and 10, it'll be
311:50 - positive and negative in between these values.
And by plugging in values, like x equals negative
312:00 - one, one and 11, I can see that f prime is
negative for x less than zero, positive for
312:09 - x between zero and 10, and negative for x
bigger than 10. In particular, f increases
312:22 - when x increases from one to 10. And then
it decreases. And so the same thing is happening
312:33 - to our sequence. Therefore, the sequence is
not monotonic. We can also use calculus to
312:41 - check if the sequence is bounded. Our first
derivative test shows that our function f
312:54 - of x has a maximum at x equals 10. At least
that's the maximum for x values, ranging from
313:03 - one to infinity. And that's all that's relevant
for our sequence. Therefore, our sequence
313:10 - is bounded above by its value at 10, which
is 10 minus five over 10 squared, or 1/20.
313:18 - Now notice that our sequence and minus five
over n squared is always bigger than zero,
313:26 - for n bigger than five since the numerator
and denominator are both positive in this
313:35 - situation. And since there are only finitely,
many terms where n is less than five, we can
313:44 - just use the minimum of these terms and zero
as a lower bound. The smallest of the first
313:52 - four terms is negative four, which is less
than zero, so that negative four forms a lower
313:57 - bound. So the sequence is in fact bounded.
And somewhat surprisingly, the calculus ideas
314:04 - of derivative and maximum and minimum. In
the past, we've encountered limits, like the
314:09 - limit as x goes to two of x minus two over
x squared minus four. We can't evaluate this
314:18 - limit just by plugging In two for x, because
x minus two goes to zero, and x squared minus
314:29 - four goes to zero as x goes to two. This is
known as a zero over zero indeterminate form.
314:39 - It's called indeterminate because we can't
tell what the limits going to be just by the
314:44 - fact that the numerator goes to zero and the
denominator goes to zero. It depends on how
314:54 - fast the numerator and the denominator are
going to zero compared to each other. And
315:01 - the final limit of the quotient could be any
number at all, or it could be infinity, or
315:08 - it could not even exist. In the past, we've
been able to evaluate some limits in zero
315:14 - over zero indeterminate form by using algebraic
tricks to rewrite the quotients. In this video,
315:18 - we'll introduce lopatok rule, which is a very
powerful technique for evaluating limits and
315:22 - indeterminate forms. A limit of the form the
limit as x goes to a of f of x over g of x
315:30 - is called a zero over zero indeterminate form.
If the limit as x goes to a of f of x is equal
315:38 - to zero, and the limit as x goes to a of g
of x is equal to zero. A limit in this form
315:48 - is called an infinity over infinity indeterminate
form. If the limit as x goes to a of f of
315:59 - x is equal to infinity or minus infinity.
And the limit as x goes to a pub g of x is
316:14 - equal to infinity or minus infinity. We saw
an example of a zero over zero indeterminate
316:19 - form in the introductory slide. One example
of a infinity over infinity indeterminate
316:25 - form is the limit as x goes to infinity of
3x squared minus 2x plus seven divided by
316:31 - negative 2x squared plus 16. Notice that as
x goes to infinity, the numerator goes to
316:37 - infinity while the denominator goes to negative
infinity. In these definitions of indeterminate
316:42 - form, it's possible for a to be a negative
infinity or infinity, like it is in this example,
316:47 - but it doesn't have to be loopy. talls rule
can be applied when f and g are differentiable
316:53 - functions. And the derivative of g is nonzero
in some open interval around a except possibly
317:01 - in a
317:02 - Now if I draw my number line, since f prime
is equal to zero at zero and 10, it'll be
317:11 - positive and negative in between these values.
And by plugging in values, like x equals negative
317:18 - one, one and 11, I can see that f prime is
negative for x less than zero, positive for
317:24 - x between zero and 10, and negative for x
bigger than 10. In particular, f increases
317:29 - when x increases from one to 10. And then
it decreases. And so the same thing is happening
317:36 - to our sequence. Therefore, the sequence is
not monotonic. We can also use calculus to
317:46 - check if the sequence is bounded. Our first
derivative test shows that our function f
317:55 - of x has a maximum at x equals 10. At least
that's the maximum for x values, ranging from
318:01 - one to infinity. And that's all that's relevant
for our sequence. Therefore, our sequence
318:07 - is bounded above by its value at 10, which
is 10 minus five over 10 squared, or 1/20.
318:16 - Now notice that our sequence and minus five
over n squared is always bigger than zero,
318:33 - for n bigger than five since the numerator
and denominator are both positive in this
318:44 - situation. And since there are only finitely,
many terms where n is less than five, we can
318:54 - just use the minimum of these terms and zero
as a lower bound. The smallest of the first
319:00 - four terms is negative four, which is less
than zero, so that negative four forms a lower
319:06 - bound. So the sequence is in fact bounded.
And somewhat surprisingly, the calculus ideas
319:13 - of derivative and maximum and minimum. In
the past, we've encountered limits, like the
319:18 - limit as x goes to two of x minus two over
x squared minus four. We can't evaluate this
319:26 - limit just by plugging In two for x, because
x minus two goes to zero, and x squared minus
319:34 - four goes to zero as x goes to two. This is
known as a zero over zero indeterminate form.
319:42 - It's called indeterminate because we can't
tell what the limits going to be just by the
319:48 - fact that the numerator goes to zero and the
denominator goes to zero. It depends on how
319:54 - fast the numerator and the denominator are
going to zero compared to each other. And
320:04 - the final limit of the quotient could be any
number at all, or it could be infinity, or
320:15 - it could not even exist. In the past, we've
been able to evaluate some limits in zero
320:23 - over zero indeterminate form by using algebraic
tricks to rewrite the quotients. In this video,
320:30 - we'll introduce lopatok rule, which is a very
powerful technique for evaluating limits and
320:38 - indeterminate forms. A limit of the form the
limit as x goes to a of f of x over g of x
320:43 - is called a zero over zero indeterminate form.
If the limit as x goes to a of f of x is equal
320:51 - to zero, and the limit as x goes to a of g
of x is equal to zero. A limit in this form
320:59 - is called an infinity over infinity indeterminate
form. If the limit as x goes to a of f of
321:09 - x is equal to infinity or minus infinity.
And the limit as x goes to a pub g of x is
321:15 - equal to infinity or minus infinity. We saw
an example of a zero over zero indeterminate
321:19 - form in the introductory slide. One example
of a infinity over infinity indeterminate
321:23 - form is the limit as x goes to infinity of
3x squared minus 2x plus seven divided by
321:29 - negative 2x squared plus 16. Notice that as
x goes to infinity, the numerator goes to
321:34 - infinity while the denominator goes to negative
infinity. In these definitions of indeterminate
321:40 - form, it's possible for a to be a negative
infinity or infinity, like it is in this example,
321:46 - but it doesn't have to be loopy. talls rule
can be applied when f and g are differentiable
321:56 - functions. And the derivative of g is nonzero
in some open interval around a except possibly
322:04 - in a
322:05 - under these conditions, if the limit as x
goes to a of f of x over g of x is zero over
322:14 - zero or infinity over infinity indeterminate
form, then the limit as x goes to a of f of
322:27 - x over g of x is the same thing as the limit
as x goes to a of f prime of x over g prime
322:36 - of x, provided that the second limit exists,
or as plus or minus infinity. Let's look at
322:42 - loopy towers rule in action. In this example,
as x goes to infinity, the numerator x goes
322:49 - to infinity and the denominator three to the
x also goes to infinity. So we have an infinity
322:55 - over infinity indeterminate form. So let's
try applying lopi tos rule, our original limit
323:02 - should equal the limit as x goes to infinity
of the derivative of the numerator, which
323:16 - is one divided by the derivative of the denominator,
which is ln of three times three to the x,
323:22 - provided that the second limit exists or as
infinity or negative infinity. In the second
323:25 - limit, the numerators just fixed at one. And
the nominator goes to infinity as x goes to
323:28 - infinity. Therefore, the second limit is just
zero. And so the original limit evaluates
323:35 - to zero as well. In this example, we have
a zero over zero indeterminate form, because
323:46 - as x goes to zero, sine of x and x, both go
to zero in the numerator, and sine of x cubed
323:54 - goes to zero in the denominator. So using
loopy tells rule, I'll try to evaluate instead,
323:59 - the limit I get by taking the derivative of
the numerator and the derivative of the denominator.
324:03 - The derivative of sine x minus x is cosine
of x minus one, and the derivative of sine
324:10 - x cubed is three times sine x squared times
cosine x using the chain rule. Now let me
324:18 - try to evaluate the limit again. As x goes
to zero, cosine of x goes to one, so the numerator
324:27 - here goes to zero. As x goes to zero, sine
of x goes to zero and cosine of x goes to
324:32 - one, so the denominator also goes to zero.
So I still have a zero over zero and determinant
324:38 - form. And I might as well try applying leptitox
rule again. But before I do, I want to point
324:44 - out that cosine of x is going to one. So the
cosine of x here really isn't affecting my
324:53 - limit. And in fact, I could rewrite my limit
of a product as a product of limits, where
325:01 - the second limit is just one and can be ignored
from here on out. Now apply lopatok rule on
325:12 - this first limit, which is a little bit easier
to take the derivatives. And so the derivative
325:20 - of the top is minus sine x. And the derivative
of the bottom is six times sine x times cosine
325:28 - x. Now let's try to evaluate again, as x goes
to zero, our numerator is going to zero and
325:38 - our denominator is also going to zero. But
hang on, we don't have to apply lobby towels
325:43 - rule again, because we can actually just simplify
our expression, the sine x on the top cancels
325:50 - with the sine x on the bottom. And we can
just rewrite our limit as the limit of negative
325:55 - one over six cosine of x, which evaluates
easily to negative one, six. In this example,
326:01 - I want to emphasize that it's a good idea
to simplify after each application of lopi
326:05 - talls rule. If you don't simplify, like we
did here, then you might be tempted to apply
326:13 - lopatok rule and additional time when you
don't need to, which might make the problem
326:35 - more complicated. Instead of simpler to solve
this video, we were able to evaluate zero
326:42 - over zero and infinity over infinity indeterminate
forms by replacing the limit of f of x over
326:50 - g of x with the limit of f prime of x over
g prime of x, provided that second limit exists.
326:59 - This trick is known as lopi tels rule. We've
seen that lopatok rule can be used to evaluate
327:08 - limits of the form zero over zero, or infinity
over infinity. In this video, we'll continue
327:14 - to use loopy towels rule to evaluate additional
indeterminate forms, like zero times infinity,
327:20 - infinity to the 00 to the zero, and one to
the infinity.
327:28 - under these conditions, if the limit as x
goes to a of f of x over g of x is zero over
327:37 - zero or infinity over infinity indeterminate
form, then the limit as x goes to a of f of
327:44 - x over g of x is the same thing as the limit
as x goes to a of f prime of x over g prime
327:54 - of x, provided that the second limit exists,
or as plus or minus infinity. Let's look at
328:03 - loopy towers rule in action. In this example,
as x goes to infinity, the numerator x goes
328:15 - to infinity and the denominator three to the
x also goes to infinity. So we have an infinity
328:29 - over infinity indeterminate form. So let's
try applying lopi tos rule, our original limit
328:39 - should equal the limit as x goes to infinity
of the derivative of the numerator, which
328:47 - is one divided by the derivative of the denominator,
which is ln of three times three to the x,
328:54 - provided that the second limit exists or as
infinity or negative infinity. In the second
328:57 - limit, the numerators just fixed at one. And
the nominator goes to infinity as x goes to
329:02 - infinity. Therefore, the second limit is just
zero. And so the original limit evaluates
329:07 - to zero as well. In this example, we have
a zero over zero indeterminate form, because
329:14 - as x goes to zero, sine of x and x, both go
to zero in the numerator, and sine of x cubed
329:23 - goes to zero in the denominator. So using
loopy tells rule, I'll try to evaluate instead,
329:30 - the limit I get by taking the derivative of
the numerator and the derivative of the denominator.
329:37 - The derivative of sine x minus x is cosine
of x minus one, and the derivative of sine
329:45 - x cubed is three times sine x squared times
cosine x using the chain rule. Now let me
329:53 - try to evaluate the limit again. As x goes
to zero, cosine of x goes to one, so the numerator
329:59 - here goes to zero. As x goes to zero, sine
of x goes to zero and cosine of x goes to
330:10 - one, so the denominator also goes to zero.
So I still have a zero over zero and determinant
330:15 - form. And I might as well try applying leptitox
rule again. But before I do, I want to point
330:23 - out that cosine of x is going to one. So the
cosine of x here really isn't affecting my
330:30 - limit. And in fact, I could rewrite my limit
of a product as a product of limits, where
330:39 - the second limit is just one and can be ignored
from here on out. Now apply lopatok rule on
330:46 - this first limit, which is a little bit easier
to take the derivatives. And so the derivative
330:48 - of the top is minus sine x. And the derivative
of the bottom is six times sine x times cosine
330:55 - x. Now let's try to evaluate again, as x goes
to zero, our numerator is going to zero and
331:04 - our denominator is also going to zero. But
hang on, we don't have to apply lobby towels
331:13 - rule again, because we can actually just simplify
our expression, the sine x on the top cancels
331:24 - with the sine x on the bottom. And we can
just rewrite our limit as the limit of negative
331:35 - one over six cosine of x, which evaluates
easily to negative one, six. In this example,
331:41 - I want to emphasize that it's a good idea
to simplify after each application of lopi
331:45 - talls rule. If you don't simplify, like we
did here, then you might be tempted to apply
331:47 - lopatok rule and additional time when you
don't need to, which might make the problem
331:54 - more complicated. Instead of simpler to solve
this video, we were able to evaluate zero
332:00 - over zero and infinity over infinity indeterminate
forms by replacing the limit of f of x over
332:08 - g of x with the limit of f prime of x over
g prime of x, provided that second limit exists.
332:18 - This trick is known as lopi tels rule. We've
seen that lopatok rule can be used to evaluate
332:21 - limits of the form zero over zero, or infinity
over infinity. In this video, we'll continue
332:30 - to use loopy towels rule to evaluate additional
indeterminate forms, like zero times infinity,
332:38 - infinity to the 00 to the zero, and one to
the infinity.
332:44 - In this example, we want to evaluate the limit
of a product. Notice that as x goes to zero
332:51 - from the positive side, sine x goes to zero,
and ln x goes to negative infinity. Remember
333:00 - the graph of y equals ln x. So this is actually
a zero times infinity indeterminate form.
333:04 - Even though the second factor is going to
negative infinity, we still call it a zero
333:10 - times infinity and indeterminate form, you
can think of the Infinity here as standing
333:16 - for either positive or negative infinity.
It's indeterminate. Because as x goes to zero,
333:19 - the sine x factor is pulling the product towards
zero, while the ln x factor is pulling the
333:29 - product towards large negative numbers. And
it's hard to predict what the limit of the
333:35 - product will actually be. But the great thing
is, I can actually rewrite this product to
333:39 - look like an infinity over infinity and determinant
form, or a zero over zero and determinant
333:45 - form. Instead of sine x times ln x, I can
rewrite the limit as ln x divided by one over
333:51 - sine x. Now as x goes to zero, my numerator
is going to negative infinity. And since sine
333:58 - x is going to zero through positive numbers,
my denominator one over sine x is going to
334:02 - positive infinity. So I have an infinity over
infinity indeterminate form. Now, I could
334:08 - instead choose to leave the sine x in the
numerator, and instead, put a one over ln
334:14 - x in the denominator. If I do this, then as
x goes to zero through positive numbers, sine
334:22 - x goes to zero. And since ln x goes to negative
infinity, one over ln x goes to zero, and
334:28 - so I have a zero over zero indeterminate form.
Sometimes it can be difficult to decide which
334:34 - of these two ways to rewrite a product as
a quotient. One rule of thumb is to take the
334:44 - version that makes it easier to take the derivative
of the numerator and denominator. Another
334:53 - trick is just to try one of the ways and if
you get stuck, go back and try the other.
335:01 - I'm going to use the first method of rewriting
it because I recognize that one over sine
335:10 - x can be written as cosecant of x and I know
how to take the derivative of cosecant x using
335:14 - lopi towels rule On this infinity over infinity
indeterminate form, I can rewrite my limit
335:19 - as the limit of what I get when I take the
derivative of the numerator, that's one over
335:25 - x divided by the derivative of the denominator,
that's negative cosecant x cotangent x. As
335:31 - always, I want to simplify my expression before
going any further, I can rewrite my trig functions
335:37 - in the denominator in terms of sine and cosine.
cosecant x is one over sine x. and cotangent
335:41 - x is cosine of x over sine of x. Now flipping
and multiplying, I get the limit as x goes
335:50 - to zero plus of one over x times the sine
squared of x over negative cosine of x. In
335:58 - other words, the limit of negative sine squared
x over x cosine x, we know that cosine of
336:07 - x goes to one as x goes to zero. So I can
rewrite this as the limit of negative sine
336:19 - squared x over x times the limit of something
that goes to one. So I once again have a zero
336:29 - over zero and determinant form. And I can
apply lopatok rule yet again, taking the derivative
336:36 - of the top, I get negative two sine x, cosine
of x, and the derivative, the bottom is just
336:43 - one. Now I'm in a good position just to evaluate
the limit by plugging in zero for x in the
336:51 - numerator, I get negative two times zero times
one, the denominator is just one, so my final
336:59 - limit is zero. In this limit, we have a battle
of forces. As x is going to infinity, one
337:06 - over x is going to zero. So one plus one over
x is going to one, but the exponent x is going
337:16 - to infinity, it's hard to tell what's going
to happen here. If we had one, to any finite
337:24 - number, that would be one. But anything slightly
bigger than one, as we raise it to have bigger
337:29 - and bigger powers, we would expect to get
infinity.
337:32 - In this example, we want to evaluate the limit
of a product. Notice that as x goes to zero
337:37 - from the positive side, sine x goes to zero,
and ln x goes to negative infinity. Remember
337:46 - the graph of y equals ln x. So this is actually
a zero times infinity indeterminate form.
337:54 - Even though the second factor is going to
negative infinity, we still call it a zero
338:00 - times infinity and indeterminate form, you
can think of the Infinity here as standing
338:03 - for either positive or negative infinity.
It's indeterminate. Because as x goes to zero,
338:08 - the sine x factor is pulling the product towards
zero, while the ln x factor is pulling the
338:17 - product towards large negative numbers. And
it's hard to predict what the limit of the
338:22 - product will actually be. But the great thing
is, I can actually rewrite this product to
338:28 - look like an infinity over infinity and determinant
form, or a zero over zero and determinant
338:35 - form. Instead of sine x times ln x, I can
rewrite the limit as ln x divided by one over
338:41 - sine x. Now as x goes to zero, my numerator
is going to negative infinity. And since sine
338:47 - x is going to zero through positive numbers,
my denominator one over sine x is going to
338:53 - positive infinity. So I have an infinity over
infinity indeterminate form. Now, I could
339:00 - instead choose to leave the sine x in the
numerator, and instead, put a one over ln
339:08 - x in the denominator. If I do this, then as
x goes to zero through positive numbers, sine
339:13 - x goes to zero. And since ln x goes to negative
infinity, one over ln x goes to zero, and
339:20 - so I have a zero over zero indeterminate form.
Sometimes it can be difficult to decide which
339:25 - of these two ways to rewrite a product as
a quotient. One rule of thumb is to take the
339:31 - version that makes it easier to take the derivative
of the numerator and denominator. Another
339:36 - trick is just to try one of the ways and if
you get stuck, go back and try the other.
339:42 - I'm going to use the first method of rewriting
it because I recognize that one over sine
339:52 - x can be written as cosecant of x and I know
how to take the derivative of cosecant x using
339:59 - lopi towels rule On this infinity over infinity
indeterminate form, I can rewrite my limit
340:09 - as the limit of what I get when I take the
derivative of the numerator, that's one over
340:16 - x divided by the derivative of the denominator,
that's negative cosecant x cotangent x. As
340:20 - always, I want to simplify my expression before
going any further, I can rewrite my trig functions
340:27 - in the denominator in terms of sine and cosine.
cosecant x is one over sine x. and cotangent
340:34 - x is cosine of x over sine of x. Now flipping
and multiplying, I get the limit as x goes
340:44 - to zero plus of one over x times the sine
squared of x over negative cosine of x. In
340:52 - other words, the limit of negative sine squared
x over x cosine x, we know that cosine of
340:58 - x goes to one as x goes to zero. So I can
rewrite this as the limit of negative sine
341:04 - squared x over x times the limit of something
that goes to one. So I once again have a zero
341:19 - over zero and determinant form. And I can
apply lopatok rule yet again, taking the derivative
341:24 - of the top, I get negative two sine x, cosine
of x, and the derivative, the bottom is just
341:31 - one. Now I'm in a good position just to evaluate
the limit by plugging in zero for x in the
341:41 - numerator, I get negative two times zero times
one, the denominator is just one, so my final
341:47 - limit is zero. In this limit, we have a battle
of forces. As x is going to infinity, one
341:55 - over x is going to zero. So one plus one over
x is going to one, but the exponent x is going
342:07 - to infinity, it's hard to tell what's going
to happen here. If we had one, to any finite
342:14 - number, that would be one. But anything slightly
bigger than one, as we raise it to have bigger
342:21 - and bigger powers, we would expect to get
infinity.
342:24 - So our limit has an independent permanent
form, it's hard to tell whether the answer
342:28 - is going to be one infinity, or maybe something
in between. Whenever I see an expression with
342:35 - a variable in the base, and a variable in
the exponent, I'm tempted to use logarithms.
342:44 - If we set y equal to one plus one over x to
the x, then if I take the natural log of both
342:52 - sides, I can use my log roles to rewrite that
by multiplying by x in the front. Now, if
342:59 - I wanted to take the limit as x goes to infinity
of ln y, that would be the limit of this product,
343:10 - x times ln one plus one over x. As x goes
to infinity, the first factor x goes to infinity.
343:18 - One plus one over x goes to just one and ln
one is going to zero. So we have infinity
343:25 - times zero indeterminate form, which we can
try to rewrite as an infinity over infinity,
343:32 - or a zero over zero indeterminate form. Let's
rewrite this as the limit of ln one plus one
343:39 - over x divided by one of our x. This is indeed
a zero over zero indeterminate form. So we
343:44 - can use lobi tiles rule and take the derivative
of the top and the bottom. The derivative
343:51 - of the top is one over one plus one over x
times the derivative of the inside, which
343:57 - would be negative one over x squared. And
the derivative on the bottom, the derivative
344:02 - one over x is negative one over x squared,
we can actually cancel out these two factors,
344:09 - and rewrite our limit as the limit as x goes
to infinity of one over one plus one over
344:14 - x, which is just equal to one since one over
x is going to zero. So we found that the limit
344:23 - of ln y is equal to one, but we're really
interested in finding the limit of y which
344:31 - we can think of as e to the ln y. Since ln
y is going to one, e to the ln y must be going
344:39 - to e to the one. In other words, E. So we
found that our original limit is equal to
344:45 - E. And in fact, you may recognize that this
limit is one of the ways of defining E.
344:49 - So our limit has an independent permanent
form, it's hard to tell whether the answer
344:53 - is going to be one infinity, or maybe something
in between. Whenever I see an expression with
344:58 - a variable in the base, and a variable in
the exponent, I'm tempted to use logarithms.
345:04 - If we set y equal to one plus one over x to
the x, then if I take the natural log of both
345:10 - sides, I can use my log roles to rewrite that
by multiplying by x in the front. Now, if
345:18 - I wanted to take the limit as x goes to infinity
of ln y, that would be the limit of this product,
345:28 - x times ln one plus one over x. As x goes
to infinity, the first factor x goes to infinity.
345:36 - One plus one over x goes to just one and ln
one is going to zero. So we have infinity
345:48 - times zero indeterminate form, which we can
try to rewrite as an infinity over infinity,
345:52 - or a zero over zero indeterminate form. Let's
rewrite this as the limit of ln one plus one
345:56 - over x divided by one of our x. This is indeed
a zero over zero indeterminate form. So we
346:01 - can use lobi tiles rule and take the derivative
of the top and the bottom. The derivative
346:08 - of the top is one over one plus one over x
times the derivative of the inside, which
346:19 - would be negative one over x squared. And
the derivative on the bottom, the derivative
346:30 - one over x is negative one over x squared,
we can actually cancel out these two factors,
346:36 - and rewrite our limit as the limit as x goes
to infinity of one over one plus one over
346:44 - x, which is just equal to one since one over
x is going to zero. So we found that the limit
346:53 - of ln y is equal to one, but we're really
interested in finding the limit of y which
346:56 - we can think of as e to the ln y. Since ln
y is going to one, e to the ln y must be going
347:03 - to e to the one. In other words, E. So we
found that our original limit is equal to
347:09 - E. And in fact, you may recognize that this
limit is one of the ways of defining E.
347:18 - In the previous example, we had a one to the
infinity and determinant form. And we took
347:27 - logs and used log rules to write that as an
infinity times zero indeterminate form. Well,
347:36 - the same thing can be done if we have an infinity
to the zero indeterminate form, or a zero
347:41 - to the zero and determinant form. So one to
the infinity, infinity to the zero, and zero
347:48 - to the zero are all indeterminate forms that
can be handled using lobi TAs role. In this
347:55 - video, we saw that a zero times infinity indeterminate
form could be converted to a zero over zero,
348:03 - or infinity over infinity indeterminate form
by rewriting f of x times g of x as f of x
348:14 - divided by one over g of x, or as g of x divided
by one over f of x. We also saw how to use
348:24 - lopi talls rule on these three sorts of indeterminate
forms by taking the ln of y, where y is our
348:31 - f of x to the g of x that we want to take
the limit of this video gives some tricks
348:45 - for deciding whether a sequence converges.
We say that a sequence a sub n converges,
348:51 - if the limit as n goes to infinity of the
terms, a sub n exists as a finite number.
348:58 - Otherwise, we say the sequence diverges. In
other words, a sequence diverges if the limit
349:05 - is infinity, or negative infinity, or does
not exist. More formally, we said the limit
349:11 - as n goes to infinity of a sub n equals L,
if for any small number epsilon, there's a
349:20 - number capital N, such that when the index
little n is bigger than or equal to capital
349:25 - N, a sub n is within distance epsilon of owl.
Saying that a sedan is within distance epsilon
349:32 - of L is the same thing as saying that the
absolute value of a sub n minus L is less
349:38 - than epsilon. Let me draw this as a picture.
If we put in on the x axis and a sub n on
349:45 - the y axis, we can plot our terms a sub n
like this, here, it looks like our a sub n
349:56 - are settling at a particular value, I'll draw
the value on the y axis and call it L. We
350:07 - say that the limit of a sub n is equal to
L. Because for any tiny number epsilon, here,
350:16 - I've tried to draw a distance epsilon above
L and a distance epsilon below, we can trap
350:23 - or a sub ends within epsilon of L by requiring
the index and to be big enough, for the epsilon
350:31 - I've chosen here, are a sub ends are trapped
within epsilon of L, when little n is bigger
350:40 - than equal to three. So there is that big
number n, which is here, like two or three,
350:47 - such that when little n is bigger than that
the a sub n are always trapped within epsilon
350:54 - of L. And if I chosen a tinier epsilon, I
would just have to go a little bit farther
350:59 - out to make sure that my sequence was trapped
within epsilon of n about this is the epsilon
351:07 - definition of a limit. Formally, we say the
limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n is
351:15 - infinity. If for any big number, omega, there's
a number capital N, such that a sub n is bigger
351:20 - than capital N, for a little n bigger than
or equal to capital N. In other words, no
351:25 - matter how big an Omega I originally pick,
my terms a sub n are eventually true. Above
351:30 - omega. Let me draw a picture for this one
too. My terms here again, are drawn in red.
351:37 - And now if I pick a certain height omega,
eventually all my turns will be above omega.
351:43 - And if I pick a different, bigger value of
omega, my terms will still eventually be bigger
351:46 - than omega, I might just need to go further
out in my sequence.
351:50 - In the previous example, we had a one to the
infinity and determinant form. And we took
351:54 - logs and used log rules to write that as an
infinity times zero indeterminate form. Well,
351:58 - the same thing can be done if we have an infinity
to the zero indeterminate form, or a zero
352:06 - to the zero and determinant form. So one to
the infinity, infinity to the zero, and zero
352:10 - to the zero are all indeterminate forms that
can be handled using lobi TAs role. In this
352:17 - video, we saw that a zero times infinity indeterminate
form could be converted to a zero over zero,
352:23 - or infinity over infinity indeterminate form
by rewriting f of x times g of x as f of x
352:32 - divided by one over g of x, or as g of x divided
by one over f of x. We also saw how to use
352:45 - lopi talls rule on these three sorts of indeterminate
forms by taking the ln of y, where y is our

353:00 - for deciding whether a sequence converges.
We say that a sequence a sub n converges,

353:15 - Otherwise, we say the sequence diverges. In

356:02 - And if I pick a different, bigger value of
omega, my terms will still eventually be bigger
356:09 - than omega, I might just need to go further
out in my sequence.
356:17 - For this first value of omega, I would just
need to pick a capital N of about 123456.
356:25 - Once my little ends are all bigger than six,
my Ace events are bigger than that omega,
356:34 - and for this bigger value of omega, I need
to pick a value of capital N of about nine,
356:42 - once my little ends are bigger than about
nine, all my as events would be bigger than
356:48 - this omega. There's a similar definition for
the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n
356:57 - equaling negative infinity. Now we just need
to say that for any big negative number, omega,
357:03 - there's a number. And such that a sub n is
less than omega for a little n bigger than
357:15 - or equal to capital N. Please take a moment
and try to come up with an example of a sequence
357:28 - that converges, a sequence that diverges to
infinity or negative infinity, and a sequence
357:31 - that's bounded but still diverges. One example
of a convergent sequence is a sequence whenever
357:36 - n, this sequence converges to zero, since
the limit as n goes to infinity of one over
357:41 - N is zero. A divergent sequence is two to
the N. Since the limit as n goes to infinity
357:46 - of two to the n is infinity. One example of
a sequence that's bounded, but still diverges
357:54 - is negative one to the n. The sequence alternates
between negative one and one, depending on
358:04 - whether n is odd, or even. So it's bounded
in between negative one and one. But it still
358:12 - diverges because the limit does not exist.
Since the sequence doesn't settle at a single
358:21 - value. The rest of this video will give some
techniques for proving that sequences converge.
358:33 - The first technique is to use standard calculus
tricks for finding limits of functions. Even
358:44 - though a sequence is only defined on positive
integers. Sometimes it's possible to find
358:51 - a function defined on all positive real numbers
that agrees with our sequence on the integers.
359:00 - In other words, the terms as of n are equal
to f of n for this function F. When this happens,
359:08 - then if the limit as x goes to infinity of
f of x equals L, then the limit as n goes
359:22 - to infinity of a sub n also equals out, the
red dots are converging to the same limit
359:30 - as the blue function. So a lot of times, we
can figure out if a sequence converges by
359:38 - replacing the terms a sub n with F of X for
some appropriate function, and then using
359:48 - lobaton ruler, other tricks from calculus
one to show that the function limit exists.
359:52 - Let's try that for the following example.
When the indices are missing, as in this example,
359:59 - we'll assume that n starts at one and goes
to infinity. In order to prove that this sequence
360:08 - converges, let's instead look at the function
f of x equals ln one plus two e to the x over
360:18 - x, where x is a real number. Now let's look
at the limit as x goes to infinity of f of
360:25 - x. That's the limit as x goes to infinity
of ln one plus two e to the x over x. And
360:34 - as x goes to infinity in the x goes to infinity,
so one plus two times e to the x goes to infinity,
360:42 - which means ln of that goes to infinity. So
the numerator is going to infinity as x goes
360:51 - to infinity. And so as the denominator, we
have an infinity over an infinity indeterminate
360:54 - form. So we can apply lobby towels rule and
take the derivative of the numerator over
361:00 - the derivative of the denominator, the derivative
of the numerator one over one plus two times
361:06 - e to the x times two times e to the x using
the chain rule, and the derivative of the
361:12 - denominator is just one. We can take derivatives
here, because we're thinking of x as a real
361:22 - number, not just an integer. Simplifying,
we still have an infinity over infinity indeterminate
361:30 - form. So let's take the derivatives again,
361:32 - For this first value of omega, I would just
need to pick a capital N of about 123456.
361:40 - Once my little ends are all bigger than six,
my Ace events are bigger than that omega,
361:48 - and for this bigger value of omega, I need
to pick a value of capital N of about nine,
361:54 - once my little ends are bigger than about
nine, all my as events would be bigger than
362:01 - this omega. There's a similar definition for
the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n
362:13 - equaling negative infinity. Now we just need
to say that for any big negative number, omega,
362:21 - there's a number. And such that a sub n is
less than omega for a little n bigger than
362:27 - or equal to capital N. Please take a moment
and try to come up with an example of a sequence
362:36 - that converges, a sequence that diverges to
infinity or negative infinity, and a sequence
362:40 - that's bounded but still diverges. One example
of a convergent sequence is a sequence whenever
362:46 - n, this sequence converges to zero, since
the limit as n goes to infinity of one over
362:53 - N is zero. A divergent sequence is two to
the N. Since the limit as n goes to infinity
363:03 - of two to the n is infinity. One example of
a sequence that's bounded, but still diverges
363:07 - is negative one to the n. The sequence alternates
between negative one and one, depending on
363:14 - whether n is odd, or even. So it's bounded
in between negative one and one. But it still
363:19 - diverges because the limit does not exist.
Since the sequence doesn't settle at a single
363:27 - value. The rest of this video will give some

363:46 - In other words, the terms as of n are equal
to f of n for this function F. When this happens,

364:48 - we'll assume that n starts at one and goes
to infinity. In order to prove that this sequence
364:54 - converges, let's instead look at the function
f of x equals ln one plus two e to the x over
365:05 - x, where x is a real number. Now let's look
at the limit as x goes to infinity of f of
365:19 - x. That's the limit as x goes to infinity
of ln one plus two e to the x over x. And
365:29 - as x goes to infinity in the x goes to infinity,
so one plus two times e to the x goes to infinity,
365:39 - which means ln of that goes to infinity. So
the numerator is going to infinity as x goes
365:50 - to infinity. And so as the denominator, we
have an infinity over an infinity indeterminate
365:55 - form. So we can apply lobby towels rule and
take the derivative of the numerator over
366:02 - the derivative of the denominator, the derivative
of the numerator one over one plus two times
366:08 - e to the x times two times e to the x using
the chain rule, and the derivative of the
366:13 - denominator is just one. We can take derivatives
here, because we're thinking of x as a real
366:21 - number, not just an integer. Simplifying,
we still have an infinity over infinity indeterminate
366:29 - form. So let's take the derivatives again,
366:32 - the derivative of the numerator is now two
times e to the x, and the derivative of the
366:40 - denominator is also two times e to the x.
So their limit here is one. Since our function
366:46 - converges to one, our sequence also converges
to one. So this original sequence converges
366:50 - to one.
366:51 - the derivative of the numerator is now two
times e to the x, and the derivative of the
367:00 - denominator is also two times e to the x.
So their limit here is one. Since our function
367:05 - converges to one, our sequence also converges
to one. So this original sequence converges
367:10 - to one.
367:11 - Another technique for proving that sequences
converge is to use the squeeze theorem and
367:14 - trap the sequence between two simpler sequences
that converge to the same limit. In this example,
367:17 - since sine and cosine are both bounded in
between one and negative one, we know that
367:22 - cosine of n plus sine of n can't be any bigger
than two, certainly, or on a smaller than
367:27 - negative two. If I divide all sides of this
inequality by n to the two thirds, we can
367:28 - see that the original sequence is bounded
in between negative two over n to the two
367:34 - thirds and two over n to the two thirds. Notice
that n to the two thirds has to be positive,
367:42 - since as usual, we're assuming that n starts
as one and goes to infinity. And so dividing
367:46 - by n to the two thirds does not switch the
inequality signs. Now it's easy to check that
367:54 - the limit as n goes to infinity of negative
two over n to the two thirds is zero, since
367:58 - as n goes to infinity, and to the two thirds
also goes to infinity. Similarly, the limit
368:02 - as n goes to infinity of two over n to the
two thirds is zero. Since these two limits
368:08 - are the same, we know by the squeeze theorem,
that the limit of our sequence in the middle
368:14 - has to exist at equals zero. Also, it's a
remarkable fact that I won't prove here that
368:19 - if a sub n is bounded, and monotonic, then
it has to converge. You might get some intuition
368:29 - for this fact, by looking at a graph. If the
ace of ends are monotonically, increasing,
368:36 - for example, but are bounded, then there's
no place for these events to go. And they
368:43 - can't oscillate up and down. Because they're
monotonically increasing. So it makes intuitive
368:47 - sense that they have to settle on some limit.
A fun example of this fact is a sequence that
368:52 - starts point 1.1 2.12 3.1234, and so on. Where
we just keep stringing together the counting
368:58 - numbers as our decimal, the sequence is certainly
monotonically increasing, and is bounded.
369:03 - Since every term of the sequence is greater
than zero and less than, say, point five.
369:09 - So we have a bounded monotonic sequence. And
so the sequence has to converge. Now, what
369:15 - it actually converges to is a little mysterious,
since it doesn't converge to some number we're
369:24 - already familiar with like, like, point six,
or pi over three or something like that. But
369:33 - it does converge to some real number. And
that real number is called champion nouns
369:38 - constant. And it has some interesting properties.
And of course, it has a decimal expansion
369:44 - that's easy to to come up with, since you
get it just by stringing together the counting
369:50 - numbers. If you can recognize a sequence to
be a geometric sequence, then it's pretty
369:55 - easy to decide whether it converges or diverges.
Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence
370:00 - of the form a times r to the n minus one where
n runs from one to infinity. Or sometimes
370:08 - it's written as a times r to the n, where
n runs from zero to infinity. Let's try to
370:16 - figure out for what values of our the sequence
r to the n converges. It's not really important
370:26 - here whether and starts at zero or starts
So one, since when we talk about convergence,
370:33 - we're talking about the behavior of the terms
as n goes to infinity. So the first few terms
370:40 - really don't matter. if r is greater than
one, then the sequence r to the n is an increasing
370:45 - sequence. In fact, for the sequence r to the
n, if we replace n with x, and look at the
370:52 - function f of x equals r to the x, that's
an exponential function. And if we're assuming
370:57 - r is greater than one, the base for our exponential
functions is greater than one. So we know
371:07 - that the limit as x goes to infinity of our
to the X is infinity, which means that our
371:16 - sequence r to the n also has to diverge to
infinity.
371:19 - Another technique for proving that sequences
converge is to use the squeeze theorem and
371:23 - trap the sequence between two simpler sequences
that converge to the same limit. In this example,
371:29 - since sine and cosine are both bounded in
between one and negative one, we know that
371:36 - cosine of n plus sine of n can't be any bigger
than two, certainly, or on a smaller than
371:44 - negative two. If I divide all sides of this
inequality by n to the two thirds, we can
371:52 - see that the original sequence is bounded
in between negative two over n to the two
371:56 - thirds and two over n to the two thirds. Notice
that n to the two thirds has to be positive,
372:01 - since as usual, we're assuming that n starts
as one and goes to infinity. And so dividing
372:06 - by n to the two thirds does not switch the
inequality signs. Now it's easy to check that
372:15 - the limit as n goes to infinity of negative
two over n to the two thirds is zero, since
372:25 - as n goes to infinity, and to the two thirds
also goes to infinity. Similarly, the limit
372:36 - as n goes to infinity of two over n to the
two thirds is zero. Since these two limits
372:42 - are the same, we know by the squeeze theorem,
that the limit of our sequence in the middle
372:52 - has to exist at equals zero. Also, it's a
remarkable fact that I won't prove here that
372:58 - if a sub n is bounded, and monotonic, then
it has to converge. You might get some intuition
373:05 - for this fact, by looking at a graph. If the
ace of ends are monotonically, increasing,
373:09 - for example, but are bounded, then there's
no place for these events to go. And they
373:16 - can't oscillate up and down. Because they're
monotonically increasing. So it makes intuitive
373:23 - sense that they have to settle on some limit.
A fun example of this fact is a sequence that
373:34 - starts point 1.1 2.12 3.1234, and so on. Where
we just keep stringing together the counting
373:40 - numbers as our decimal, the sequence is certainly
monotonically increasing, and is bounded.
373:49 - Since every term of the sequence is greater
than zero and less than, say, point five.
373:58 - So we have a bounded monotonic sequence. And
so the sequence has to converge. Now, what
374:03 - it actually converges to is a little mysterious,
since it doesn't converge to some number we're
374:11 - already familiar with like, like, point six,
or pi over three or something like that. But
374:18 - it does converge to some real number. And
that real number is called champion nouns
374:25 - constant. And it has some interesting properties.
And of course, it has a decimal expansion
374:32 - that's easy to to come up with, since you
get it just by stringing together the counting
374:40 - numbers. If you can recognize a sequence to
be a geometric sequence, then it's pretty
374:46 - easy to decide whether it converges or diverges.
Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence
374:52 - of the form a times r to the n minus one where
n runs from one to infinity. Or sometimes
374:56 - it's written as a times r to the n, where
n runs from zero to infinity. Let's try to
375:03 - figure out for what values of our the sequence
r to the n converges. It's not really important
375:09 - here whether and starts at zero or starts
So one, since when we talk about convergence,
375:14 - we're talking about the behavior of the terms
as n goes to infinity. So the first few terms
375:27 - really don't matter. if r is greater than
one, then the sequence r to the n is an increasing
375:43 - sequence. In fact, for the sequence r to the
n, if we replace n with x, and look at the
375:48 - function f of x equals r to the x, that's
an exponential function. And if we're assuming
375:54 - r is greater than one, the base for our exponential
functions is greater than one. So we know
376:02 - that the limit as x goes to infinity of our
to the X is infinity, which means that our
376:11 - sequence r to the n also has to diverge to
infinity.
376:16 - If instead, r is equal to one, then r to the
n is just one to the n, which is just a sequence
376:28 - of ones, so that converges to one. if r is
between zero and one, then r to the n, is
376:34 - decreasing. This time, it's like the exponential
function f of x equals r to the x with the
376:46 - base between zero and one. And so the limit
of that exponential function, as x goes to
376:53 - infinity is going to be equals zero. Therefore,
the sequence also converges to zero. Of course,
377:00 - if r equals exactly zero, and 
the sequence is just a sequence of zeros,
377:11 - so it also converges to zero. Next, let's
look at the case when r is between negative
377:17 - one and zero. Now, the sequence of rd ends
are going to oscillate between positive and
377:22 - negative numbers that get smaller and smaller
and magnitude as n goes to infinity. That's
377:28 - because we get from one number to the next
by multiplying by r, which is a negative number
377:34 - of magnitude less than one. So our limit as
n goes to infinity of our A to the ends, is
377:44 - going to be zero again. Another way of thinking
about this case, is by thinking about the
377:50 - squeeze theorem, since r to the n is always
less than or equal to the absolute value of
377:58 - r to the n, which is o n is always greater
than or equal to negative the absolute value
378:05 - of r to the n. Technically, r to the n is
always exactly equal to the absolute value
378:18 - are the n when n is even, so that art of the
N is positive. And it's always exactly equal
378:30 - to the negative of the absolute value of r,
the N, when n is odd, so that are the n is,
378:40 - is negative. But in any case, the inequality
still does technically hold. And so therefore,
378:46 - since by the squeeze theorem, the limit of
the left terms is zero, and the limit of the
378:53 - right terms is zero. As we noted before, the
limit of the middle term also has to be zero.
378:59 - So our sequence converges to zero. Now, if
r is equal to negative one, then our sequence
379:05 - r to the n is just negative one to the n,
which alternates between negative one and
379:10 - one. And so that sequence diverges. Finally,
if r is less than negative one, then to get
379:19 - from one term to the next, we're multiplying
by negative number that has magnitude bigger
379:24 - than one. And so our terms are going to oscillate
between positive and negative numbers, but
379:32 - they're going to be going up in magnitude.
And so the limit as n goes to infinity of
379:41 - a sub n, does not exist. And we see that our
sequence diverges. If we look through all
379:46 - these cases, we see that the sequence r to
the n converges to zero, when r is between
379:54 - negative one and one. it converges to one
when r is exactly equal to one, and it diverges
380:03 - when r is bigger than one or less than negative
one. All right, then Summary below. In fact,
380:12 - almost the same thing as true, when we look
at the sequence a times r to the n, where
380:23 - A is any real number, the sequence a times
r to the n converges to zero, when r is between
380:36 - negative one and one. it converges to a, when
r is equal to one. And it diverges when r
380:50 - is less than negative one, or greater than
one. This follows because multiplying all
380:55 - the terms in the sequence by a just multiplies
the limit by a and zero times as zero, well,
381:02 - one times i is a. So anytime you encounter
a geometric sequence, that is a sequence that
381:08 - can be written in the form of a times r to
the n,
381:12 - If instead, r is equal to one, then r to the
n is just one to the n, which is just a sequence
381:19 - of ones, so that converges to one. if r is
between zero and one, then r to the n, is
381:27 - decreasing. This time, it's like the exponential
function f of x equals r to the x with the
381:33 - base between zero and one. And so the limit
of that exponential function, as x goes to
381:42 - infinity is going to be equals zero. Therefore,
the sequence also converges to zero. Of course,
381:49 - if r equals exactly zero, and the sequence
is just a sequence of zeros, so it also converges
381:55 - to zero. Next, let's look at the case when
r is between negative one and zero. Now, the
381:57 - sequence of rd ends are going to oscillate
between positive and negative numbers that
382:00 - get smaller and smaller and magnitude as n
goes to infinity. That's because we get from
382:08 - one number to the next by multiplying by r,
which is a negative number of magnitude less
382:17 - than one. So our limit as n goes to infinity
of our A to the ends, is going to be zero
382:23 - again. Another way of thinking about this
case, is by thinking about the squeeze theorem,
382:27 - since r to the n is always less than or equal
to the absolute value of r to the n, which
382:36 - is o n is always greater than or equal to
negative the absolute value of r to the n.
382:43 - Technically, r to the n is always exactly
equal to the absolute value are the n when
382:50 - n is even, so that art of the N is positive.
And it's always exactly equal to the negative
383:00 - of the absolute value of r, the N, when n
is odd, so that are the n is, is negative.
383:07 - But in any case, the inequality still does
technically hold. And so therefore, since
383:11 - by the squeeze theorem, the limit of the left
terms is zero, and the limit of the right
383:17 - terms is zero. As we noted before, the limit
of the middle term also has to be zero. So
383:22 - our sequence converges to zero. Now, if r
is equal to negative one, then our sequence
383:29 - r to the n is just negative one to the n,
which alternates between negative one and
383:36 - one. And so that sequence diverges. Finally,
if r is less than negative one, then to get
383:44 - from one term to the next, we're multiplying
by negative number that has magnitude bigger
383:52 - than one. And so our terms are going to oscillate
between positive and negative numbers, but
383:58 - they're going to be going up in magnitude.
And so the limit as n goes to infinity of
384:05 - a sub n, does not exist. And we see that our
sequence diverges. If we look through all
384:15 - these cases, we see that the sequence r to
the n converges to zero, when r is between
384:25 - negative one and one. it converges to one
when r is exactly equal to one, and it diverges
384:35 - when r is bigger than one or less than negative
one. All right, then Summary below. In fact,
384:44 - almost the same thing as true, when we look
at the sequence a times r to the n, where
384:52 - A is any real number, the sequence a times
r to the n converges to zero, when r is between
385:07 - negative one and one. it converges to a, when
r is equal to one. And it diverges when r
385:13 - is less than negative one, or greater than
one. This follows because multiplying all
385:19 - the terms in the sequence by a just multiplies
the limit by a and zero times as zero, well,
385:30 - one times i is a. So anytime you encounter
a geometric sequence, that is a sequence that
385:35 - can be written in the form of a times r to
the n,
385:40 - you can know that it converges if r is bigger
than negative one and less than or equal to
385:50 - one. This sequence here, although it looks
really complicated, it's really a geometric
385:57 - sequence in disguise. One way to see this
is by simplifying the form of the terms, so
386:02 - this is negative one to the t, e to the t
times e to the minus one over three to the
386:10 - T times three squared. This is the same thing
as negative e over three to the T times one
386:18 - over three squared times E. Now this is looking
like the tail end of a geometric sequence,
386:26 - where A is one over three squared times E,
and R, the common ratio is minus e over three,
386:36 - say the tail end, because we have T starting
at three instead of zero. Now since he is
386:45 - less than three, the magnitude of our is got
to be smaller than one. In other words, our
386:52 - as a negative number, that's between negative
one and zero, and therefore, the tail end
387:01 - of 
this geometric sequence converges. It's kind
387:09 - of interesting to note that we could also
rewrite this geometric sequence if we wanted
387:21 - to, using an index and going from zero to
infinity. And one way to figure out how to
387:28 - do that the are the common ratio stays the
same as negative e over three. But since this
387:36 - version starts at t equals three, the first
term here is really minus e over three cubed
387:38 - times one over three squared E. And that becomes
our value of A. Notice that when n is zero
387:43 - here, I get this value. And when t is three,
here, I get the same value for this sequence.
387:47 - So these sequences are equivalent. But in
any case, for either a sequence, the common
387:52 - ratio, R is negative B over three, and a sequence
converges. Therefore, the final trick that
387:59 - I want to mention for deciding whether sequences
converge or diverge is limit laws, the usual
388:03 - limit laws about addition, subtraction, and
so on hold for sequences as well for functions.
388:07 - So for example, if the limit as n goes to
infinity of a sub n is out, and the limit
388:14 - of b sub n is am than the limit of the sum,
a sub n plus b sub n is going to be equal
388:26 - to L plus m. And the limit of a sub n times
b sub n is L times M. And the limit of C times
388:39 - a sub n where C is some constant is going
to be c times though similar roles holds for
388:51 - subtraction and division. I want to emphasize
that these limit holds hold under the condition
388:55 - that the limits of the component sequences
exist as finite numbers. I can use these limit
389:01 - laws to decide if this sequence converges,
since the limit of the terms is equal to the
389:10 - difference of the limits, provided those limits
exist. Now the first limit is zero, since
389:14 - the degree of the numerator is less than the
degree of the denominator here, and the second
389:24 - limit is also zero. Since this is a geometric
sequence, with ratio of four fifths, and four
389:32 - fifths is between zero and one. Therefore,
the limit of our original sequence must be
389:40 - zero. In this video, we saw several ways to
prove that a sequence converges. We saw that
389:48 - we could use calculus techniques like lopi
taas rule. After replacing the sequence with
389:55 - its associated function defined on real numbers,
we also saw that we could use the squeeze
390:01 - theorem. we noted that all sequences that
are bounded and monotonic must converge. And
390:06 - we saw that geometric sequences always converge
if r is bigger than negative one and less
390:13 - than or equal to one. Finally, we saw that
we can use limit laws to handle sums and products
390:18 - and other conglomerations of sequences. This
video is about geometric series, and when
390:23 - they converge, and when they diverged.
390:24 - you can know that it converges if r is bigger
than negative one and less than or equal to
390:30 - one. This sequence here, although it looks
really complicated, it's really a geometric
390:35 - sequence in disguise. One way to see this
is by simplifying the form of the terms, so
390:41 - this is negative one to the t, e to the t
times e to the minus one over three to the
390:50 - T times three squared. This is the same thing
as negative e over three to the T times one
391:03 - over three squared times E. Now this is looking
like the tail end of a geometric sequence,
391:11 - where A is one over three squared times E,
and R, the common ratio is minus e over three,
391:15 - say the tail end, because we have T starting
at three instead of zero. Now since he is
391:25 - less than three, the magnitude of our is got
to be smaller than one. In other words, our
391:34 - as a negative number, that's between negative
one and zero, and therefore, the tail end
391:43 - of this geometric sequence converges. It's
kind of interesting to note that we could
391:51 - also rewrite this geometric sequence if we
wanted to, using an index and going from zero
392:00 - to infinity. And one way to figure out how
to do that the are the common ratio stays
392:13 - the same as negative e over three. But since
this version starts at t equals three, the
392:19 - first term here is really minus e over three
cubed times one over three squared E. And
392:32 - that becomes our value of A. Notice that when
n is zero here, I get this value. And when
392:41 - t is three, here, I get the same value for
this sequence. So these sequences are equivalent.
392:47 - But in any case, for either a sequence, the
common ratio, R is negative B over three,
393:00 - and a sequence converges. Therefore, the final
trick that I want to mention for deciding
393:08 - whether sequences converge or diverge is limit
laws, the usual limit laws about addition,
393:14 - subtraction, and so on hold for sequences
as well for functions. So for example, if
393:20 - the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n
is out, and the limit of b sub n is am than
393:26 - the limit of the sum, a sub n plus b sub n
is going to be equal to L plus m. And the
393:44 - limit of a sub n times b sub n is L times
M. And the limit of C times a sub n where
393:54 - C is some constant is going to be c times
though similar roles holds for subtraction
393:59 - and division. I want to emphasize that these
limit holds hold under the condition that
394:05 - the limits of the component sequences exist
as finite numbers. I can use these limit laws
394:09 - to decide if this sequence converges, since
the limit of the terms is equal to the difference
394:16 - of the limits, provided those limits exist.
Now the first limit is zero, since the degree
394:24 - of the numerator is less than the degree of
the denominator here, and the second limit
394:30 - is also zero. Since this is a geometric sequence,
with ratio of four fifths, and four fifths
394:44 - is between zero and one. Therefore, the limit
of our original sequence must be zero. In
394:54 - this video, we saw several ways to prove that
a sequence converges. We saw that we could
395:02 - use calculus techniques like lopi taas rule.
After replacing the sequence with its associated
395:06 - function defined on real numbers, we also
saw that we could use the squeeze theorem.
395:12 - we noted that all sequences that are bounded
and monotonic must converge. And we saw that
395:16 - geometric sequences always converge if r is
bigger than negative one and less than or
395:19 - equal to one. Finally, we saw that we can
use limit laws to handle sums and products
395:26 - and other conglomerations of sequences. This
video is about geometric series, and when
395:32 - they converge, and when they diverged.
395:34 - A geometric sequence is a sequence of the
form a a times r, a times r squared, a times
395:43 - r cubed, and so on. For some numbers a and
r. this can be written in the wrapped up notation,
395:51 - a times r to the k, where k goes from zero
to infinity. For example, if a is three, and
396:01 - r is one half, the sequence would be three,
three halves, three fourths, three eighths,
396:11 - and so on, which could be written as three
times one half to the k, where k ranges from
396:18 - zero to infinity. A geometric series is the
series you get by adding all these numbers
396:27 - up. So that would be a plus a times r plus
a times r squared, and so on, which can be
396:38 - written in summation notation is the sum from
K equals zero to infinity of A times r to
396:49 - the K. For our example, our series would be
the following, which could be written as the
397:01 - sum from K equals zero to infinity of three
times one half to the K. Sometimes you might
397:11 - get a geometric series that's in disguise,
like this one. If I write out the first few
397:16 - terms, notice that we're told to start with
i equals two. So plugging in i equals two
397:21 - here, I get negative one, squared over three
to the two times two minus three, that's one
397:26 - over three. If I plug in i equals three, I
get negative one cubed, that's over three
397:36 - to the two times three minus three, or negative
one over three cubed, negative 127. When I
397:44 - go four, I get one over 243. If I look at
the ratio of consecutive terms, negative 127
397:52 - divided by 1/3, is negative one night. Similarly,
the ratio here is also negative one nights,
397:56 - suggesting that we might have a geometric
series with ratio R of negative 1/9. And first
398:03 - term coming from here, of 1/3. But there's
another way to see this that's less arithmetic
398:10 - intensive, and makes use of exponent rules.
If we look at the basic term, and rewrite
398:17 - it using exponent rules, this is three to
the two i times three to the minus three,
398:23 - I can rewrite the three to the two is three
squared to the I and the three to the minus
398:39 - three and the denominator becomes a three
cubed and the numerator. Now I can group together
398:51 - all the pieces that are raised to the nth
power. And write this as negative 1/9 to the
398:59 - i times three cubed, or 27 times negative
one night to the I reading like this, I can
399:07 - see that every time I increases by one, I
get another factor of negative one nine multiplied
399:11 - in my expression. And therefore, the this
is a geometric series with ratio negative
399:17 - one nine, as I saw before, now, you might
think that the first term should be 27. But
399:26 - remember that it doesn't start at zero, it
starts at two. So the first term is going
399:31 - to be what I get I get when I plug in the
first value of i. So that's 27 times negative
399:40 - one nine squared, which works out to 1/3.
as before. So we do have a geometric series
399:45 - with first term of 1/3, a common ratio of
negative 1/9. In fact, we could rewrite it
399:52 - in a more standard form as the sum of 1/3
times negative 1/9 to the k, where k ranges
399:59 - from zero to infinity. Since k equals zero,
and this expression corresponds to i equals
400:06 - two in this expression, k is equal to, can
be thought of as equal to i minus two. And
400:12 - this is really a reindexing tugann simplification
to get from this version to this version.
400:15 - A geometric sequence is a sequence of the
form a a times r, a times r squared, a times
400:21 - r cubed, and so on. For some numbers a and
r. this can be written in the wrapped up notation,
400:28 - a times r to the k, where k goes from zero
to infinity. For example, if a is three, and
400:35 - r is one half, the sequence would be three,
three halves, three fourths, three eighths,
400:42 - and so on, which could be written as three
times one half to the k, where k ranges from
400:52 - zero to infinity. A geometric series is the
series you get by adding all these numbers
401:01 - up. So that would be a plus a times r plus
a times r squared, and so on, which can be
401:07 - written in summation notation is the sum from
K equals zero to infinity of A times r to
401:10 - the K. For our example, our series would be
the following, which could be written as the
401:16 - sum from K equals zero to infinity of three
times one half to the K. Sometimes you might

401:50 - to the two times three minus three, or negative
one over three cubed, negative 127. When I
401:55 - go four, I get one over 243. If I look at
the ratio of consecutive terms, negative 127
402:02 - divided by 1/3, is negative one night. Similarly,
the ratio here is also negative one nights,

404:17 - with first term of 1/3, a common ratio of
negative 1/9. In fact, we could rewrite it

404:40 - two in this expression, k is equal to, can
be thought of as equal to i minus two. And
404:51 - this is really a reindexing tugann simplification
to get from this version to this version.
404:56 - As you may know, a geometric sequence converges
to zero, when the common ratio R is between
405:02 - negative one and one, it converges to a, when
r is equal to one, and it diverges. Otherwise,
405:09 - when r is less than or equal to negative one,
or when r is greater than one. We're assuming
405:20 - here, that A is not equal zero, since otherwise,
we'd have a very boring though convergent
405:28 - sequence of all zeros. I want to restate this
convergence criteria in limit form, since
405:34 - we'll use it later. But it's saying is that
when r is between negative one and one, the
405:43 - limit, as K goes to infinity of A times r
to the K is zero, that's what it means to
405:58 - converge to zero. when r is equal to one,
that limit is equal to A. And when r is less
406:07 - than or equal to negative one or greater than
one, that limit does not exist as a finite
406:14 - number. Now I'd like to find similar rules
in terms of r for when a geometric series
406:22 - converges or diverges. Again, we'll assume
that a is not equal to zero. Since otherwise,
406:30 - I just have a sum of a bunch of zeros, a boring
series that would converge to zero. Our strategy
406:36 - is going to be to find a formula for the nth
partial sum of the series, and then take the
406:47 - limit of partial sums. Since by definition,
that limit tells us whether the series converges
406:52 - or diverges. Before we carry out that strategy,
I want to consider one special case, when
406:57 - r is equal to one, then the series is just
a plus a plus a, and so that diverges to infinity
407:02 - if A is positive, or to negative infinity,
if a is negative, remember, we're assuming
407:09 - that A is not zero. so far is one our series
diverges. And from now on, we'll assume that
407:14 - R is not equal to one. Let's look at a few
partial sums. The first partial sum S sub
407:21 - one, just the first term A, S sub two is a
plus a times R, and so on. In general, the
407:30 - nth partial sum s sub n is a plus a times
r plus a times r squared. And I continue until
407:34 - let's see, the last term will be a times r
to the n minus one, the second last term will
407:41 - be a times r to the n minus two. Notice that
the nth partial sum only goes up to A times
407:46 - r to the n minus one. Since we're starting
at a which is a 10 to the zero. I'd like to
407:56 - write the partial sum in a nicer form, so
I don't have to write all those dots. And
408:02 - to do that, I'm going to use a trick, I'm
going to multiply both sides of this equation
408:12 - by R. So on the left, I get r times s sub
n. And on the right, I'm going to multiply
408:19 - each term by R. So the first term becomes
a times R, the second term A times r squared,
408:26 - a times r cubed, and so on, the second to
last term becomes a times r to the n minus
408:34 - one, and the last term becomes a times r to
the n. Notice that this equation, and the
408:42 - equation under it have a lot of terms in common,
they match up along the diagonals. So if I
408:52 - subtract the second equation from the first,
on the left side, I'm going to get s sub n
408:59 - minus r times s sub n. But on the right side,
a lot of my terms will cancel, this term will
409:08 - cancel the next one, this one cancels with
the previous one. And what I'm left with is
409:13 - just a minus a times r to the n, I get a minus
sign here, because I'm subtracting the whole
409:19 - equation. Now I can solve for a sub n, I can
factor it out. I'll factor out the A also
409:27 - just to keep things tidy. And then I get that
s sub n is a times one minus r to the n over
409:40 - one minus R. I don't have to worry about dividing
by one minus r that can't be zero, because
409:44 - remember, I'm assuming that R is not one.
Now that I have a nice tidy formula for s
409:53 - sub n, I can proceed to take the limit as
n goes to infinity and see if my sequence
410:01 - of partial sums converges or diverges sets
the limit of my formula. And notice that the
410:08 - only part of this formula that depends on
n is the art of the N, a one one minus are
410:18 - all constants as far as n is concerned. So
we can use limit rurals. To take those out
410:24 - of the limit, I can rewrite the limit as a
over one minus r times the limit of one minus
410:32 - r to the n or even better as a over one minus
r times one minus the limit of r to the n.
410:40 - Now this limit I've seen before, right on
this page, is the same as the limit I was
410:42 - considering when I was looking at convergence
of sequences, where I use the same R, and
410:45 - my A is equal to one. So we know that this
limit goes to zero, when r is between negative
410:49 - one and one, and does not exist as a finite
number. when r is less than or equal to negative
410:53 - one, or r is greater than one. Therefore,
the limit of the partial sums is going to
410:56 - equal a over one minus r times one minus zero,
which is just a over one minus r, when r is
410:57 - between negative one and one, and that limit,
will not exist as a finite number. when r
410:58 - is less than or equal to negative one, or
r is greater than one. Since the limit also
410:59 - doesn't exist as a finite number, when r is
one, I can add a little equality sign. And
411:00 - now I've got all this cases for our covered
me write this down as a conclusion. The geometric
411:01 - series converges to a over one minus R.
411:02 - As you may know, a geometric sequence converges
to zero, when the common ratio R is between
411:03 - negative one and one, it converges to a, when
r is equal to one, and it diverges. Otherwise,
411:04 - when r is less than or equal to negative one,
or when r is greater than one. We're assuming
411:08 - here, that A is not equal zero, since otherwise,
we'd have a very boring though convergent
411:10 - sequence of all zeros. I want to restate this
convergence criteria in limit form, since
411:12 - we'll use it later. But it's saying is that
when r is between negative one and one, the
411:17 - limit, as K goes to infinity of A times r
to the K is zero, that's what it means to
411:24 - converge to zero. when r is equal to one,
that limit is equal to A. And when r is less
411:25 - than or equal to negative one or greater than
one, that limit does not exist as a finite
411:29 - number. Now I'd like to find similar rules
in terms of r for when a geometric series
411:33 - converges or diverges. Again, we'll assume
that a is not equal to zero. Since otherwise,
411:40 - I just have a sum of a bunch of zeros, a boring
series that would converge to zero. Our strategy
411:43 - is going to be to find a formula for the nth
partial sum of the series, and then take the
411:47 - limit of partial sums. Since by definition,
that limit tells us whether the series converges
411:51 - or diverges. Before we carry out that strategy,
I want to consider one special case, when
411:57 - r is equal to one, then the series is just
a plus a plus a, and so that diverges to infinity
412:00 - if A is positive, or to negative infinity,
if a is negative, remember, we're assuming
412:01 - that A is not zero. so far is one our series
diverges. And from now on, we'll assume that
412:02 - R is not equal to one. Let's look at a few
partial sums. The first partial sum S sub
412:03 - one, just the first term A, S sub two is a
plus a times R, and so on. In general, the
412:06 - nth partial sum s sub n is a plus a times
r plus a times r squared. And I continue until
412:09 - let's see, the last term will be a times r
to the n minus one, the second last term will
412:10 - be a times r to the n minus two. Notice that
the nth partial sum only goes up to A times
412:12 - r to the n minus one. Since we're starting
at a which is a 10 to the zero. I'd like to
412:15 - write the partial sum in a nicer form, so
I don't have to write all those dots. And
412:16 - to do that, I'm going to use a trick, I'm
going to multiply both sides of this equation
412:17 - by R. So on the left, I get r times s sub
n. And on the right, I'm going to multiply
412:24 - each term by R. So the first term becomes
a times R, the second term A times r squared,
412:25 - a times r cubed, and so on, the second to
last term becomes a times r to the n minus
412:26 - one, and the last term becomes a times r to
the n. Notice that this equation, and the
412:27 - equation under it have a lot of terms in common,
they match up along the diagonals. So if I
412:28 - subtract the second equation from the first,
on the left side, I'm going to get s sub n
412:29 - minus r times s sub n. But on the right side,
a lot of my terms will cancel, this term will
412:30 - cancel the next one, this one cancels with
the previous one. And what I'm left with is
412:31 - just a minus a times r to the n, I get a minus
sign here, because I'm subtracting the whole
412:32 - equation. Now I can solve for a sub n, I can
factor it out. I'll factor out the A also
412:33 - just to keep things tidy. And then I get that
s sub n is a times one minus r to the n over
412:34 - one minus R. I don't have to worry about dividing
by one minus r that can't be zero, because
412:35 - remember, I'm assuming that R is not one.
Now that I have a nice tidy formula for s
412:36 - sub n, I can proceed to take the limit as
n goes to infinity and see if my sequence
412:37 - of partial sums converges or diverges sets
the limit of my formula. And notice that the
412:38 - only part of this formula that depends on
n is the art of the N, a one one minus are
412:39 - all constants as far as n is concerned. So
we can use limit rurals. To take those out
412:40 - of the limit, I can rewrite the limit as a
over one minus r times the limit of one minus
412:41 - r to the n or even better as a over one minus
r times one minus the limit of r to the n.
412:42 - Now this limit I've seen before, right on
this page, is the same as the limit I was
412:43 - considering when I was looking at convergence
of sequences, where I use the same R, and
412:44 - my A is equal to one. So we know that this
limit goes to zero, when r is between negative
412:45 - one and one, and does not exist as a finite
number. when r is less than or equal to negative
412:46 - one, or r is greater than one. Therefore,
the limit of the partial sums is going to
412:47 - equal a over one minus r times one minus zero,
which is just a over one minus r, when r is
412:48 - between negative one and one, and that limit,
will not exist as a finite number. when r
412:49 - is less than or equal to negative one, or
r is greater than one. Since the limit also
412:50 - doesn't exist as a finite number, when r is
one, I can add a little equality sign. And
412:51 - now I've got all this cases for our covered
me write this down as a conclusion. The geometric
412:52 - series converges to a over one minus R.
412:53 - For
412:54 - For
412:55 - r between negative one and one, I can also
say that's the absolute value of r less than
412:56 - one, and it diverges for the absolute value
of r greater than or equal to one. Let's use
412:57 - this fact in this example. Remember that we
decided that this was a geometric series with
412:58 - a common ratio r equal to negative one night,
and we found the first term a by plugging
412:59 - in i equals two, and I got that first term
of 1/3. Since the absolute value of our sales
413:00 - value of negative 1/9 is 1/9, which is less
than one, we know that the series converges,
413:01 - and it converges to a over one minus r, so
that's 1/3 over one minus negative one nights,
413:02 - which is 1/3 over one plus one night, that's
1/3 over 10 nights, which simplifies to three
413:03 - tenths. In this video, we looked at geometric
series, with first term a common ratio R,
413:04 - we saw that a geometric series will converge
if the absolute value of r is less than one.
413:05 - And they'll diverged if the absolute value
of r is greater than or equal to one. In the
413:06 - case that it converges, it converges to a
over one minus r, where A is the first term,
413:07 - and r is the common ratio. This video explains
how to determine whether a series converges
413:08 - or diverges using an integral. Let's start
with the series, the sum of one over n squared.
413:09 - Please pause the video for a moment and think
about why this might converge or diverge.
413:10 - The sum from n equals one to infinity of one
over n squared is closely related to the integral
413:11 - from one to infinity of one over x squared
dx. Let me show you what I mean. In this picture,
413:12 - I've graphed the function y equals one over
x squared in blue. in green, I've drawn a
413:13 - bunch of rectangles, I've divided the x axis
into sub intervals of length one, and so each
413:14 - rectangle has a base of length one, and a
height given by my functions value on the
413:15 - right endpoint of the sub interval. So the
first rectangle has a base of one and a height
413:16 - of one, so it has an area of one, the second
rectangle has a base of one and a height of
413:17 - one over two squared, so that's 1/4. So the
area here is 1/4. The next rectangle base
413:18 - of one again, and a height of 1/9, and so
on. The area of each rectangle is just the
413:19 - same as its height, and its height is just
given by one over n squared for the appropriate
413:20 - value of n In other words, if I write out
the first few terms of this series, it's exactly
413:21 - the same as the areas of my rectangles. And
the sum of my series is just going to be the
413:22 - total green area. Now my integral can also
be thought of in terms of area, this integral
413:23 - represents the area from one to infinity.
Under my blue curve, we know that this area
413:24 - is finite, because we know that this integral
converges by the P test where p is two. Now
413:25 - if I just look at the rectangles, starting
with the second rectangle on, all of those
413:26 - rectangles will lie below the blue curve,
and to the right of the line x equals one,
413:27 - so they will have a smaller area, and therefore
the area of these rectangles from the second
413:28 - one on has to converge to a finite number.
That is, the sum from n equals two to infinity
413:29 - of one over n squared converges. We're interested
in the sum from one to infinity. But that's
413:30 - just the area of this single rectangle plus
the area of all these rectangles with just
413:31 - one more than this sum here. So it also converges
to a finite number. To recap, the chain of
413:32 - logic goes like this. First, we solve the
integral represents a finite area, because
413:33 - of the P test. From that, we can conclude
that the sum from n equals two to infinity
413:34 - of one over n squared represents a smaller
and also finite area. And from that, we can
413:35 - figure out that the sum from n equals one
to infinity has to represent a finite area.
413:36 - So our series converges to a finite number.
Let's look at another example. The sum from
413:37 - n equals one to infinity of one over the square
root of n.
413:38 - r between negative one and one, I can also
say that's the absolute value of r less than
413:39 - one, and it diverges for the absolute value
of r greater than or equal to one. Let's use
413:40 - this fact in this example. Remember that we
decided that this was a geometric series with
413:41 - a common ratio r equal to negative one night,
and we found the first term a by plugging
413:42 - in i equals two, and I got that first term
of 1/3. Since the absolute value of our sales
413:43 - value of negative 1/9 is 1/9, which is less
than one, we know that the series converges,
413:44 - and it converges to a over one minus r, so
that's 1/3 over one minus negative one nights,
413:45 - which is 1/3 over one plus one night, that's
1/3 over 10 nights, which simplifies to three
413:46 - tenths. In this video, we looked at geometric
series, with first term a common ratio R,
413:47 - we saw that a geometric series will converge
if the absolute value of r is less than one.
413:48 - And they'll diverged if the absolute value
of r is greater than or equal to one. In the
413:49 - case that it converges, it converges to a
over one minus r, where A is the first term,
413:50 - and r is the common ratio. This video explains
how to determine whether a series converges
413:51 - or diverges using an integral. Let's start
with the series, the sum of one over n squared.
413:52 - Please pause the video for a moment and think
about why this might converge or diverge.
413:53 - The sum from n equals one to infinity of one
over n squared is closely related to the integral
413:54 - from one to infinity of one over x squared
dx. Let me show you what I mean. In this picture,
413:55 - I've graphed the function y equals one over
x squared in blue. in green, I've drawn a
413:56 - bunch of rectangles, I've divided the x axis
into sub intervals of length one, and so each
413:57 - rectangle has a base of length one, and a
height given by my functions value on the
413:58 - right endpoint of the sub interval. So the
first rectangle has a base of one and a height
413:59 - of one, so it has an area of one, the second
rectangle has a base of one and a height of
414:00 - one over two squared, so that's 1/4. So the
area here is 1/4. The next rectangle base
414:01 - of one again, and a height of 1/9, and so
on. The area of each rectangle is just the
414:02 - same as its height, and its height is just
given by one over n squared for the appropriate
414:03 - value of n In other words, if I write out
the first few terms of this series, it's exactly
414:04 - the same as the areas of my rectangles. And
the sum of my series is just going to be the
414:05 - total green area. Now my integral can also
be thought of in terms of area, this integral
414:06 - represents the area from one to infinity.
Under my blue curve, we know that this area
414:07 - is finite, because we know that this integral
converges by the P test where p is two. Now
414:08 - if I just look at the rectangles, starting
with the second rectangle on, all of those
414:09 - rectangles will lie below the blue curve,
and to the right of the line x equals one,
414:10 - so they will have a smaller area, and therefore
the area of these rectangles from the second
414:11 - one on has to converge to a finite number.
That is, the sum from n equals two to infinity
414:12 - of one over n squared converges. We're interested
in the sum from one to infinity. But that's
414:13 - just the area of this single rectangle plus
the area of all these rectangles with just
414:14 - one more than this sum here. So it also converges
to a finite number. To recap, the chain of
414:15 - logic goes like this. First, we solve the
integral represents a finite area, because
414:16 - of the P test. From that, we can conclude
that the sum from n equals two to infinity
414:17 - of one over n squared represents a smaller
and also finite area. And from that, we can
414:18 - figure out that the sum from n equals one
to infinity has to represent a finite area.
414:19 - So our series converges to a finite number.
Let's look at another example. The sum from
414:20 - n equals one to infinity of one over the square
root of n.
414:21 - Please pause the video for a moment and think
about how you might use an integral to decide
414:22 - if this series converges or diverges. A natural
integral to consider is the integral from
414:23 - one to infinity of one over the square root
of x dx. This integral diverges by the P test,
414:24 - where p is equal to one half, which is less
than one. Let's look at a picture to compare
414:25 - areas. The blue curve here is the graph of
the function y equals one over the square
414:26 - root of x. And here, once again, I've drawn
green rectangles using the right endpoints
414:27 - to get the heights of the rectangles. So the
areas of my rectangles are the same as the
414:28 - terms in my series. As in the previous problem,
if I ignore the first rectangle, then all
414:29 - the rest of the rectangles have an area that's
less than the area under my curve from one
414:30 - to infinity. But there's a serious problem
here, the integral from one to infinity of
414:31 - one over the square root of x dx diverges
to infinity, the area of my rectangles from
414:32 - the second one on might be less than my area
under the blue curve. But being less than
414:33 - something that diverges to infinity, it tells
us nothing, this series could converge or
414:34 - it could diverged. But don't give up hope.
If we just tweak this picture a little bit,
414:35 - we'll be able to get something that we can
use here. In this second picture, I've used
414:36 - left endpoints instead of right endpoints
for the heights of my rectangles. Because
414:37 - my function y equals one over the square root
of x is a decreasing function. Using left
414:38 - endpoints, makes my rectangles have a larger
area than the area under the corresponding
414:39 - section of the curve. let me label the rectangles
with their areas. The areas of these rectangles
414:40 - correspond to the terms in my series. But
now we have that the area of the green rectangles,
414:41 - that total area, that total area is bigger
than the integral from one to infinity of
414:42 - one over x squared of x dx.
414:43 - Please pause the video for a moment and think
about how you might use an integral to decide
414:44 - if this series converges or diverges. A natural
integral to consider is the integral from
414:45 - one to infinity of one over the square root
of x dx. This integral diverges by the P test,
414:46 - where p is equal to one half, which is less
than one. Let's look at a picture to compare
414:47 - areas. The blue curve here is the graph of
the function y equals one over the square
414:48 - root of x. And here, once again, I've drawn
green rectangles using the right endpoints
414:49 - to get the heights of the rectangles. So the
areas of my rectangles are the same as the
414:50 - terms in my series. As in the previous problem,
if I ignore the first rectangle, then all
414:51 - the rest of the rectangles have an area that's
less than the area under my curve from one
414:52 - to infinity. But there's a serious problem
here, the integral from one to infinity of
414:53 - one over the square root of x dx diverges
to infinity, the area of my rectangles from
414:54 - the second one on might be less than my area
under the blue curve. But being less than
414:55 - something that diverges to infinity, it tells
us nothing, this series could converge or
414:56 - it could diverged. But don't give up hope.
If we just tweak this picture a little bit,
414:57 - we'll be able to get something that we can
use here. In this second picture, I've used
414:58 - left endpoints instead of right endpoints
for the heights of my rectangles. Because
414:59 - my function y equals one over the square root
of x is a decreasing function. Using left
415:00 - endpoints, makes my rectangles have a larger
area than the area under the corresponding
415:01 - section of the curve. let me label the rectangles
with their areas. The areas of these rectangles
415:02 - correspond to the terms in my series. But
now we have that the area of the green rectangles,
415:03 - that total area, that total area is bigger
than the integral from one to infinity of
415:04 - one over x squared of x dx.
415:05 - Since this integral diverges, and this series
is larger, it must diverged also. This method
415:06 - of comparing a series to an integral is a
very general method for showing convergence.
415:07 - It's known as the interval test. The integral
test says that if f is a continuous positive
415:08 - and decreasing function on the interval from
one to infinity, and our terms a sub n are
415:09 - equal to f evaluated at n, then if the integral
from one to infinity of f of x dx converges,
415:10 - the series from one to infinity of a sub n
converges. And if the integral from one to
415:11 - infinity of f of x dx diverges, then the series
diverges. Although I won't give a formal proof
415:12 - of this theorem, the logic behind is the same
logic we used in the previous two examples.
415:13 - If the interval converges, we use the picture
here, using write endpoints to draw rectangles.
415:14 - The area of each rectangle is the same as
its height, since the rectangle has base one,
415:15 - and the height of each rectangle is just f
sub n. So the area of the first rectangle
415:16 - is just f sub one, which is a sub one, the
area the second rectangle is F sub two, which
415:17 - is a sub two, and so on. If we focus on the
second rectangle onwards, then the combined
415:18 - area of those rectangles is less than the
area represented by the integral. So we can
415:19 - say the sum from n equals two to infinity
of a sub n is less than or equal to the integral.
415:20 - So the integral converges by assumption, this
series here has to converge, and therefore,
415:21 - our original series from n equals one to infinity
must also converge. If instead, our integral
415:22 - diverges, then we use the other picture, and
we use left endpoints for our rectangles,
415:23 - the areas of the rectangles are still given
by a sub one, a sub two, and so on. But this
415:24 - time, the combined area of the green rectangles,
that area is now greater than or equal to
415:25 - the integral of our function. Since this integral
diverges, the larger area must diverged as
415:26 - well. That's the idea behind the integral
test. And to apply it, we just need to be
415:27 - able to integrate the function that corresponds
to our terms, and check that that function
415:28 - is continuous, positive and decreasing. Actually,
it's enough to check that the function is
415:29 - eventually continuous, positive and decreasing.
By eventually I mean that it has these properties
415:30 - on some interval from R to infinity for some
number R. This is good enough, because then
415:31 - I can always draw the same pictures, just
starting with R instead of one in my picture,
415:32 - and get the integral converges if and only
if the series starting at our converges by
415:33 - the same arguments we use before, but the
series starting at our converges if and only
415:34 - if the series starting at one converges, since
adding on Finally, many extra terms to my
415:35 - series doesn't affect whether it converges
or not. And the integral from R to infinity
415:36 - converges if and only if the integral from
one to infinity converges, because similarly,
415:37 - adding on a finite little piece of area from
one to R, doesn't change the convergent status
415:38 - of the integral. So by this chain of logic,
it's okay if our function starts out increasing
415:39 - for a while, as long as it's eventually positive,
continuous and decreasing. Here's an example
415:40 - of the integral test and action. We want to
know if the sum from n equals one to infinity
415:41 - of ln n over n, converges or diverges. So
let's look instead at the integral from one
415:42 - to infinity of ln of x
415:43 - Since this integral diverges, and this series
is larger, it must diverged also. This method
415:44 - of comparing a series to an integral is a
very general method for showing convergence.
415:45 - It's known as the interval test. The integral
test says that if f is a continuous positive
415:46 - and decreasing function on the interval from
one to infinity, and our terms a sub n are
415:47 - equal to f evaluated at n, then if the integral
from one to infinity of f of x dx converges,
415:48 - the series from one to infinity of a sub n
converges. And if the integral from one to
415:49 - infinity of f of x dx diverges, then the series
diverges. Although I won't give a formal proof
415:50 - of this theorem, the logic behind is the same
logic we used in the previous two examples.
415:51 - If the interval converges, we use the picture
here, using write endpoints to draw rectangles.
415:52 - The area of each rectangle is the same as
its height, since the rectangle has base one,
415:53 - and the height of each rectangle is just f
sub n. So the area of the first rectangle
415:54 - is just f sub one, which is a sub one, the
area the second rectangle is F sub two, which
415:55 - is a sub two, and so on. If we focus on the
second rectangle onwards, then the combined
415:56 - area of those rectangles is less than the
area represented by the integral. So we can
415:57 - say the sum from n equals two to infinity
of a sub n is less than or equal to the integral.
415:58 - So the integral converges by assumption, this
series here has to converge, and therefore,
415:59 - our original series from n equals one to infinity
must also converge. If instead, our integral
416:00 - diverges, then we use the other picture, and
we use left endpoints for our rectangles,
416:01 - the areas of the rectangles are still given
by a sub one, a sub two, and so on. But this
416:02 - time, the combined area of the green rectangles,
that area is now greater than or equal to
416:03 - the integral of our function. Since this integral
diverges, the larger area must diverged as
416:04 - well. That's the idea behind the integral
test. And to apply it, we just need to be
416:05 - able to integrate the function that corresponds
to our terms, and check that that function
416:06 - is continuous, positive and decreasing. Actually,
it's enough to check that the function is
416:07 - eventually continuous, positive and decreasing.
By eventually I mean that it has these properties
416:08 - on some interval from R to infinity for some
number R. This is good enough, because then
416:09 - I can always draw the same pictures, just
starting with R instead of one in my picture,
416:10 - and get the integral converges if and only
if the series starting at our converges by
416:11 - the same arguments we use before, but the
series starting at our converges if and only
416:12 - if the series starting at one converges, since
adding on Finally, many extra terms to my
416:13 - series doesn't affect whether it converges
or not. And the integral from R to infinity
416:14 - converges if and only if the integral from
one to infinity converges, because similarly,
416:15 - adding on a finite little piece of area from
one to R, doesn't change the convergent status
416:16 - of the integral. So by this chain of logic,
it's okay if our function starts out increasing
416:17 - for a while, as long as it's eventually positive,
continuous and decreasing. Here's an example
416:18 - of the integral test and action. We want to
know if the sum from n equals one to infinity
416:19 - of ln n over n, converges or diverges. So
let's look instead at the integral from one
416:20 - to infinity of ln of x
416:21 - over x.
416:22 - over x.
416:23 - This is a continuous function, because it's
the quotient of two continuous functions,
416:24 - and we're starting at an x value of one, so
we don't have to worry about the denominator
416:25 - being zero. It's also a positive function.
Since we know that ln of x is greater than
416:26 - zero for x bigger than one, and therefore
this quotient is greater than
416:27 - This is a continuous function, because it's
the quotient of two continuous functions,
416:28 - and we're starting at an x value of one, so
we don't have to worry about the denominator
416:29 - being zero. It's also a positive function.
Since we know that ln of x is greater than
416:30 - zero for x bigger than one, and therefore
this quotient is greater than
416:31 - zero also.
416:32 - zero also.
416:33 - Finally, let's check if our function is decreasing.
One way to do that is to look at the derivative.
416:34 - If f of x is ln x over x, then f prime of
x by the quotient rule is x times one over
416:35 - x minus ln x times one over x squared. This
simplifies to one minus ln x over x squared,
416:36 - which is negative when one minus ln x is less
than zero, that is one is less than our an
416:37 - x, that is E is less than x. So the function
has a negative derivative and is decreasing
416:38 - whenever x is bigger than E, so it's eventually
decreasing the three conditions
416:39 - Finally, let's check if our function is decreasing.
One way to do that is to look at the derivative.
416:40 - If f of x is ln x over x, then f prime of
x by the quotient rule is x times one over
416:41 - x minus ln x times one over x squared. This
simplifies to one minus ln x over x squared,
416:42 - which is negative when one minus ln x is less
than zero, that is one is less than our an
416:43 - x, that is E is less than x. So the function
has a negative derivative and is decreasing
416:44 - whenever x is bigger than E, so it's eventually
decreasing the three conditions
416:45 - They're met, so we can apply the integral
test. Next, we need to figure out if this
416:46 - integral converges
416:47 - or diverges.
416:48 - This is an improper integral. So by definition,
it's the limit as t goes to infinity of the
416:49 - integral from one to T of ln x over x. We
can use use of the tuition to evaluate it,
416:50 - where u is equal to ln x, d u is equal to
one over x dx. And when x is equal to one,
416:51 - u is equal to ln of one, that's zero, when
x is equal to t, u is equal to ln of t. Substituting
416:52 - in, we get the integral from zero to ln T
of you do this integrates to use squared over
416:53 - two evaluated between ln T and zero.
416:54 - Substituting in our bounds of integration,
we get the limit as t goes to infinity of
416:55 - ln t squared over two minus zero. Now as t
goes to infinity, ln of T also goes to infinity.
416:56 - So ln t squared over two goes to infinity,
therefore, the integral diverges. And so by
416:57 - the integral test, the series also diverges.
In this video, we saw that a series converges
416:58 - if and only if the corresponding integral
converges, provided that the corresponding
416:59 - function is eventually continuous, positive
and decreasing. In this video, we'll determine
417:00 - whether series converge or diverge by comparing
them to more familiar series. Suppose that
417:01 - the sum of a sub n and the sum of b sub n
are series. And suppose that the terms of
417:02 - the series are always greater than or equal
to zero, and that a sub n is less than or
417:03 - equal to b sub n for all n. In the pictures
below, the heights of the blue bars are supposed
417:04 - to represent the ACE events, and the heights
of the green bars are supposed to represent
417:05 - the base events. If we put the pictures together,
we see that the heights of the blue bars are
417:06 - less than the heights of the green bars. So
we have the inequality, zero is less than
417:07 - or equal to a sub n is less than or equal
to b sub n. Since the base of each bar has
417:08 - length one, the height of each bar is the
same number as its area. So when we write
417:09 - the sum from n equals one to infinity, of
a sub n, this represents the area of all the
417:10 - blue rectangles added up the total blue area.
And when we write sum from n equals one to
417:11 - infinity of b sub n, this represents the area
of all the green rectangles, the total green
417:12 - area. Because the blue bars have a smaller
area than the green bars, we can make some
417:13 - conclusions. First of all, if the total green
area is finite, then so is the total blue
417:14 - area. In other words, if the sum of the b
sub n converges, then so does the sum of the
417:15 - A sub N. Furthermore, if the total blue area
is infinite, then so is the total green area.
417:16 - So we can also say, if the sum of the ace
of ends diverges, then so does the sum of
417:17 - the base events. These facts are known as
the comparison test for series and are very
417:18 - useful in establishing convergence. But we
have to be careful not to take the conclusions
417:19 - too far. In particular, if the smaller series
of Ace events converges, then we really can't
417:20 - say anything about the larger series of these
events. The some of the big events could converge,
417:21 - red could diverge. Also, if the larger series
of B sub ends diverges, then we can't conclude
417:22 - anything about the smaller series of Ace events,
the sum of the ACE events could converge or
417:23 - could diverged. When using the comparison
test to establish convergence or divergence,
417:24 - it's handy to compare your unfamiliar series
to a familiar series that you already know
417:25 - converges or diverges. The following series
are especially handy when making these comparisons.
417:26 - First, the geometric series Sum of A times
r to the n, which converges when the absolute
417:27 - value of r is less than one. And second, the
P series, one over n to the P, which converges
417:28 - when p is greater than one. Let's use a comparison
theorem to determine whether the sum of three
417:29 - to the n over five to the n plus n squared
converges or diverges. What matters most as
417:30 - far as whether a series converges or diverges
is the behavior of the terms, when n gets
417:31 - close to infinity, the behavior of the terms
when n is small, the behavior the first few
417:32 - terms doesn't make any difference as far as
whether that series converges or diverges.
417:33 - So I'm going to focus on what happens to these
terms, as n goes to infinity, well, three
417:34 - to the n goes to infinity, and five to the
n goes to infinity, and n squared also goes
417:35 - to infinity.
417:36 - But between five to the n and n squared, five
to the n is going to infinity much faster.
417:37 - So I'm going to say that this five to the
n term dominates the denominator, it's more
417:38 - important. And for that reason, the behavior
of the series we're given should be similar
417:39 - to the behavior of the series, three to the
n, over five to the n, where I've just left
417:40 - out the n squared term, which is insignificant
compared to five to the n when n is large.
417:41 - So I'm going to compare our given series to
this other series, which is a geometric series.
417:42 - In fact,
417:43 - the second series we know converges, because
it has a common ratio of three fifths, and
417:44 - the absolute value of three fifths is less
than one. In order to use the comparison theorem,
417:45 - I'm going to need to compare the terms of
this series to the terms of this series. And
417:46 - I want to show that these terms are less than
or equal to those terms, because being smaller
417:47 - than a convergent series will guarantee convergence
is clear that everything's positive, so we
417:48 - don't have to worry about that. And it's also
clear that five to the n plus n squared is
417:49 - bigger than or equal to five to the n. When
you divide by a bigger number, you get a smaller
417:50 - ratio. So three to the n over five to the
n plus n squared is therefore less than or
417:51 - equal to three to the n over five to the n,
we've shown that the inequality we need holds.
417:52 - And so by the comparison theorem, since the
sum of three to the n over five to the n converges,
417:53 - so does our original series. We've established
convergence using the comparison test.
417:54 - This video was about the comparison test,
the fact that if we have zero less than or
417:55 - equal to A ad less than or equal to bn, and
the sum of the bands converges, then the sum
417:56 - of the smaller series A ends converges. And
if the sum of the ends diverges, then the
417:57 - sum of the larger series diverges. The limit
comparison test gives an alternative to the
417:58 - regular ordinary comparison test for series.
In the previous video, we looked at the series
417:59 - the sum from n equals one to infinity of three
to the n over five to the n plus n squared.
418:00 - And we use the ordinary comparison test and
compare it to the series, the sum of three
418:01 - to the n over five to the n. This worked out
pretty nicely, because the terms here are
418:02 - less than the terms here. And this series
converges. being less than a convergent series
418:03 - ensures convergence. But if we change the
problem very slightly, and look instead at
418:04 - the sum of three to the n over five to the
n minus n squared, look how things start to
418:05 - go wrong. If we now try to compare to the
same series, then we get the inequality five
418:06 - to the n minus n squared is less than or equal
to five to the n, and therefore, three to
418:07 - the n over five to the n minus n squared is
greater than or equal to three to the n over
418:08 - five to the n. Since dividing by a smaller
number gives a larger fraction, but this inequality
418:09 - unfortunately, is not useful to us, being
greater than a convergence series doesn't
418:10 - guarantee convergence or divergence. So we
can't conclude anything Based on this inequality,
418:11 - the limit comparison test gives us one way
around this. The limit comparison test says
418:12 - the following. Suppose that sum of a n and
the sum of bn are series with positive terms.
418:13 - If the limit as n goes to infinity of the
ratio of a n over bn, is a number L, where
418:14 - L is a finite number that's bigger than zero,
then either a both series converge,
418:15 - or both diverge, so they have the same convergence
status. Let's try the limit comparison test
418:16 - on the problem we were just working on. We
still want to compare to the same series,
418:17 - three to the n over five to the n.
418:18 - But this time, we're going to try a limit
comparison. So we're going to take the limit,
418:19 - as n goes to infinity of the ratio of terms,
three to the n over five to the n, divided
418:20 - by three to the n over five to the n minus
n squared, it doesn't actually matter which
418:21 - term goes on the top and which goes on the
bottom, we could instead take the ratio the
418:22 - other way, whatever limit we get, when we
do the ratio, this way, will just be the reciprocal
418:23 - of the limit, we get When do the ratio this
way. So if this ratio is a finite number that's
418:24 - bigger than zero, this ratio is reciprocal
will also be a finite number that's bigger
418:25 - than zero. So I'll just stick with the first
computation. let me simplify by flipping and
418:26 - multiplying, I can cancel my three to the
ends. And now I can actually rewrite this
418:27 - as the limit of one minus n squared over five
to the n. By breaking out my limit, this is
418:28 - the same as one minus the limit of n squared
over a five to the n. And the second limit
418:29 - is an infinity over infinity form. So using
lopi talls rule, carry the one over, I get
418:30 - and get the limit of what I get when I take
the derivative of the numerator and the derivative
418:31 - of the denominator, I've still got an infinity
over infinity and determinant form. So I'll
418:32 - use Libby toss rule again, the derivative
of two n is two, and the derivative of the
418:33 - denominator is ln five times ln five times
five to the n. Now the numerator is fixed
418:34 - at two, while the denominator goes to infinity
as n goes to infinity, therefore this fraction
418:35 - goes to zero. And my final limit is one. Since
one is bigger than zero, and it's finite,
418:36 - it's less than infinity. The limit comparison
test tells me that my original series and
418:37 - my comparison series, either both converge,
or both diverged. But my comparison series
418:38 - is a geometric series with ratio three fifths,
so it definitely converges. Therefore, by
418:39 - the limit comparison test, our given series
also converge us. That's the Limit Comparison
418:40 - theorem in action. The limit comparison test
tells us that for two series with positive
418:41 - terms, if the limit of the ratio of the terms
is some number, which is bigger than zero
418:42 - and less than infinity, then the two theories
have the same convergence status. That is,
418:43 - they either both converge or both diverged.
The limit comparison test is especially handy
418:44 - when the ordinary comparison test doesn't
seem to work when we know what we want to
418:45 - compare to, but we can't get the inequality
to go the right direction. In this video,
418:46 - I'll prove that the limit comparison test
works. The limit comparison test says that
418:47 - if the sum of the ACE events, and the sum
of the B sub ends are two series with positive
418:48 - terms. And if the limit as n goes to infinity
of the ratio, a sub n over B sub n is equal
418:49 - to L, where L is a finite number that's bigger
than zero, then either both series converge
418:50 - or both series diverged. To prove this theorem,
let's start by assuming that all the hypotheses
418:51 - are true. That is, we'll assume all the stuff
in brackets here is true. The limit as n goes
418:52 - to infinity of a sub n over B sub n equals
L means that if I plot the numbers, 123, and
418:53 - so on, on the x axis, so those are the values
of n, and I plot the ratios, a sub n over
418:54 - B sub n, on the y axis, those ratios are going
to settle down to a value of L, as n goes
418:55 - to infinity. Using more technical mathematical
language, it means that for any small
418:56 - number, epsilon that's bigger than zero, we
can trap the ratios within epsilon of L, as
418:57 - long as we go out far enough for our values
of n. That is, there exists a number capital
418:58 - N, such that n over bn is between L plus epsilon.
And l minus epsilon for little n bigger than
418:59 - or equal to capital N. In the picture here,
value for capital N of three would work, because
419:00 - for all little ends bigger than or equal to
three, my ratios are trapped in between r
419:01 - minus epsilon, which is right here, and l
plus epsilon, which is that upper bound here.
419:02 - Let's pick a small enough epsilon. So this
interval here doesn't extend all the way down
419:03 - to zero through zero on the y axis, it just
extends through through positive numbers near
419:04 - owl. Recall that that l itself is a positive
number, so it's possible to trap it in a little
419:05 - interval. That's all positive numbers. For
example, we could pick epsilon to be equal
419:06 - to L over two, for example,
419:07 - that way, the interval that I'm drawing here
would extend down to l minus l over two, which
419:08 - is equal to L over two, and our extend up
to l plus l over two, which is three L over
419:09 - two. So we have that l over two is less than
a n over bn is less than three L over two,
419:10 - four little n bigger than or equal to our
capital N that works for that value of epsilon.
419:11 - Now, I'm going to multiply all three sides
of this inequality by b sub n, recall that
419:12 - b sub n is a positive number, all the series
terms are positive, so that doesn't change
419:13 - around the inequalities at all. So we get
L over two times b sub n is less than a sub
419:14 - n is less than three L over two times b sub
n. And remember that everything here is bigger
419:15 - than zero, since all the ACE events and B
sub ends are positive. Let's think about what
419:16 - this inequality tells us. First of all, if
the sum of the beast events converges, then
419:17 - so does the sum of three L over two times
b sub n, because I'm just multiplying that
419:18 - series by a constant still convergent. But
now my a sub n terms are less than the terms
419:19 - of a convergent series. So by the ordinary
comparison test, we know that the sum of the
419:20 - ACE events converges also. Furthermore, if
the sum of the base events diverges, then
419:21 - we can focus on this part of the inequality,
we know that l over two times b sub n diverges
419:22 - also. And so here we have
419:23 - the ace of ends are bigger than the terms
of a Divergent series, so the sum of the AC
419:24 - bands must diverged, just using the ordinary
comparison test. Now, you might be worried
419:25 - about the fact that this inequality only holds
for little n bigger than or equal to some
419:26 - capital N. So we could rewrite this argument
a little bit to say, if the sum from n equals
419:27 - one to infinity of the base events converges,
then so does the sum from n equals capital
419:28 - n to infinity of b sub n, because adding or
subtracting finitely many terms off the front
419:29 - never changes the convergence status of a
series. After that, we can say well, then
419:30 - so does the sum from n equals capital n to
infinity. Three L over two times b sub n.
419:31 - And so then by the ordinary comparison test,
since this inequality does hold for our little
419:32 - n bigger than or equal to capital N, we can
conclude that the sum from little n equals
419:33 - capital n to infinity of a sub n converges.
And so the sum from n equals one to infinity
419:34 - of a sub n converges Also, since again, adding
or subtracting Finally, many terms from the
419:35 - beginning of a series doesn't change anything
about convergence. We could similarly rewrite
419:36 - the second part of the argument using precise
indices as well. We've shown that the sum
419:37 - of the B ends and the sum of the A ends either
both converge, or both diverged. And that
419:38 - completes the proof of the theorem. In this
video, we prove the limit comparison test
419:39 - using the ordinary comparison test. This video
defines absolute convergence and how it's
419:40 - related to convergence for a series. A series
is called absolutely convergent. If the series
419:41 - of absolute values of the terms converges.
Please pause the video for a moment and try
419:42 - to decide which of the following series are
convergent, and which ones are absolutely
419:43 - convergent. The first series is convergent,
because it's a geometric series with ratio
419:44 - r equal to negative 0.8. It's also absolutely
convergent, because if I take the series of
419:45 - absolute values, that's the same thing as
the series, the geometric series with a ratio
419:46 - of 0.8, which is also convergent. The second
series, the sum of one over the square root
419:47 - of k is not convergent, we can see this by
the P test. Since p is equal to one half,
419:48 - which is less than one. It's also not absolutely
convergent. In this case, the sum of the absolute
419:49 - values of the terms is just the same as the
sum of the original terms, which we already
419:50 - said diverges. The third series is the sum
of negative one to the J times one over j.
419:51 - This is a convergent series by the alternating
series test. In fact, this is the alternating
419:52 - harmonic series. What about absolute convergence?
If we look at the sum of the absolute values
419:53 - of the terms, that's just the same thing as
the regular harmonic series, which diverges.
419:54 - So this series is not absolutely convergent.
Here's a question for you. Is it possible
419:55 - to have a series that's convergent, but not
absolutely convergent? Please pause the video
419:56 - for a moment and try to answer this question.
The answer is yes. We just saw us an example
419:57 - of such a series, the alternating harmonic
series. There are many other examples of such
419:58 - theories. And in fact, there's a special name
for them, they're called conditionally convergent.
419:59 - A series is called conditionally convergent
if it is convergent, but not absolutely convergent.
420:00 - In symbols, that is, the sum of the a ns converges,
but the sum of the absolute values of the
420:01 - a ns diverges. Next question for you. Is it
possible to have a series that's absolutely
420:02 - convergent, but not convergent? This is a
little trickier. But please pause the video
420:03 - for a moment and think about your answer.
420:04 - The answer to this one is no. It's a fact
that every absolutely convergent series is
420:05 - convergent. Let me prove to you why that's
true. Let's suppose that we have a series
420:06 - that's absolutely convergent. That is the
sum of the absolute value of the A ends convergence.
420:07 - We know that the A ends might be positive
or negative, but they do have to lie in between
420:08 - the absolute value of a n and the negative
absolute value of a n. Actually, it's true
420:09 - that a sub n is either equal to its absolute
value or its negative absolute value, but
420:10 - I'm ready This way with inequalities to help
set the mood for using the comparison test.
420:11 - Now, I can't quite use a comparison test here
to prove that the series of Ace events converges,
420:12 - because even though the ace of ends are less
than or equal to the terms of a convergent
420:13 - series, they're not necessarily positive or
greater than equals zero. And the can parison
420:14 - test only applies to series whose terms are
all greater than equal to or equal to zero.
420:15 - But there's a nice trick to get around that
difficulty. And that trick is to add the absolute
420:16 - value of a sub n to all the sides of the inequality.
So then I get zero is less than or equal to
420:17 - a sub n plus the absolute value of a sub n,
which is less than or equal to twice the absolute
420:18 - value of a sub n. Now, since this sum of the
absolute value of f sub n converges, so does
420:19 - the sum of twice the absolute value of a sub
n, since it's just a constant multiple. Based
420:20 - on this inequality, which now does involve
terms that are greater than or equal to zero,
420:21 - I can conclude that the sum of a sub n plus
the absolute value of a sub n converges based
420:22 - on the ordinary comparison test. But now,
the series that we want, the sum of the ace
420:23 - of ends can be written as a difference. And
we know that a series formed by subtracting
420:24 - the terms of two convergent series itself
converges. So this converges, in fact, to
420:25 - the difference of the sobs. We've proved that
if our series is absolutely convergent, then
420:26 - it must be convergent. The fact that absolute
convergence implies convergence can come in
420:27 - handy when you're trying to prove that a series
converges, as in the following example. In
420:28 - this example, we want to prove that this series
is convergent or divergent, but the cosine
420:29 - and sine make things a little bit tricky.
My intuition here is that this series should
420:30 - converge since cosine and sine are bounded.
And so this essentially should behave something
420:31 - like the sum of one over n cubed, which converges
because of the P
420:32 - test.
420:33 - But we can't just compare our series to the
sum of one over n cubed and use the ordinary
420:34 - comparison test like we've done in similar
problems in the past. What's different here
420:35 - is that our terms are not always going to
be positive, because sine and cosine can be
420:36 - positive and negative. And so can there's
some to help us out of this pickle. Let's
420:37 - think about absolute convergence instead.
If we look at the sum of the absolute values,
420:38 - which is the same as the sum of the absolute
value of the numerator, divided by m cubed.
420:39 - Since cosine of n is between one and negative
one, and sine of n is also in between one
420:40 - and negative one, we know that the som cosine
n plus sine of n has to be less than or equal
420:41 - to two and bigger than or equal to negative
two. In fact, it can't even get all the way
420:42 - to two or all the way down to negative two,
we could find that tighter bound if we tried,
420:43 - but this is good enough for our purposes,
this inequality can be rewritten as the absolute
420:44 - value of cosine n plus sine of n is less than
or equal to two. And if I divide both sides
420:45 - here by n cubed, I have an inequality involving
positive terms. So since we know the sum of
420:46 - one over n cubed converges by the P test,
that implies that the sum of two over n cubed
420:47 - also converges. It's just a constant multiple.
And that implies that the sum of my absolute
420:48 - value of cosine n plus sine n over n cubed
converges by the comparison test. Therefore,
420:49 - we know that our series is absolutely convergent.
And therefore, it must be convergent. Since
420:50 - an absolutely convergent series is always
convergent. We've shown that our original
420:51 - series converges. In this video, we saw that
if a series is absolutely convergent, then
420:52 - it has to be convergent But not vice versa.
This video is about the ratio test, a test
420:53 - that can be used to prove that a series converges
or diverges. The ratio test is all about looking
420:54 - at the ratio of consecutive terms. To figure
out how it works, it can be helpful to think
420:55 - about geometric series first, recall it for
a geometric series, the ratio of consecutive
420:56 - terms is given by this number R. And if R
has absolute value less than one, the series
420:57 - converges. Why while if R has absolute value
greater than one, it diverges. For more general
420:58 - series, the ratio of consecutive terms is
not necessarily a constant. But if we look
420:59 - at the limit as n goes to infinity, of the
absolute value of the ratio of consecutive
421:00 - terms, and if we get a limit of L, which is
less than one, then the series converges,
421:01 - just like a geometric series. In fact, the
series is absolutely convergent, meaning the
421:02 - sum of the absolute values of the a ns converges,
and therefore, the sum of the a ns converges
421:03 - also, if instead, the limit as n goes to infinity
of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive
421:04 - terms, is a number l that's greater than one.
Or if that limit is infinity, then just like
421:05 - a geometric series, the series diverges. Finally,
if the limit of the absolute value of the
421:06 - ratio of consecutive terms is exactly equal
to one, or if the limit doesn't exist, then
421:07 - the ratio test is inconclusive. That is, the
sum of the ace of ends may converge. Or it
421:08 - may diverge. And to figure out, which will
have to use a different test or a different
421:09 - argument, let's apply the ratio test to this
series, we'll need to compute the limit as
421:10 - n goes to infinity of the absolute value of
the ratio of consecutive terms. In this case,
421:11 - that's the limit as n goes to infinity, have
the absolute value of n plus one
421:12 - squared
421:13 - times negative 10 to the n plus one divided
by n plus one factorial, all of our n squared
421:14 - times negative 10 to the n over n factorial.
I've just plugged in n plus one for n in this
421:15 - formula to get the a sub n plus one term.
I can simplify this by flipping and multiplying.
421:16 - And I'm going to rearrange my factors. This
expression is equivalent to the previous one,
421:17 - I've just arranged factors so that similar
factors are on top of each other, this will
421:18 - make it easier to cancel things. Now, n factorial
means n times n minus one times n minus two
421:19 - and so on. And n plus one factorial means
n plus one, times n times n minus one, and
421:20 - so on. So if I divide n factorial by n plus
one factorial, all my factors from the numerator
421:21 - will cancel with factors from the denominator.
And I'll just be left with one over n plus
421:22 - one. Also, negative 10 to the n plus one over
negative 10 to the n cancels out to just negative
421:23 - 10 to the One Power, so I can rewrite my limit
as N plus one squared over n squared times
421:24 - negative 10 times one over n plus one, I'm
going to divide my limit of a product into
421:25 - a product of limits. Now as n goes to infinity,
n plus one over n goes to one. So this expression,
421:26 - which is equivalent to the square of n plus
one over N, also goes to one. The limit of
421:27 - the absolute value of negative 10 is just
10. And the limit as n goes to infinity of
421:28 - one over n plus one is zero. Therefore our
limit is one times 10 times zero, which is
421:29 - zero. And since zero is less than one by the
ratio test, we know that our series converges
421:30 - absolutely. This video was about the ratio
test, which focuses on the limit as n goes
421:31 - to infinity of the absolute value of the ratio
of consecutive terms. Depending on whether
421:32 - this limit is less than one greater than one,
or equal to one, we can determine whether
421:33 - the series converges or diverges. Or if we
need to try another test. In this video, I
421:34 - prove the ratio test for convergence and divergence
of series.
421:35 - The ratio test says that for a series, if
the limit of the absolute value of the ratio
421:36 - of consecutive terms is equal to a number
L, that's less than one, then the series is
421:37 - absolutely convergent, and therefore convergent.
If however, the limit of the absolute value
421:38 - of the ratio of consecutive terms is a number
L, that's bigger than one, or is equal to
421:39 - infinity, then the series is divergent. Although
I didn't write it here, if the limit is equal
421:40 - to one exactly, or if the limit doesn't exist,
then the ratio test is inconclusive and can't
421:41 - be used to establish convergence or divergence.
To prove that the ratio test works, let's
421:42 - first assume that the limit is less than one.
This means that if I graph n on the x axis,
421:43 - and my absolute value of the ratio of consecutive
terms, on my Y axis, I get a bunch of dots
421:44 - that settle at a value of L. and this number
L is less than one. Let's pick a tiny number
421:45 - epsilon, so that when I add epsilon to L,
I'm still less than one.
421:46 - So
421:47 - pick epsilon greater than zero, such that
l plus epsilon is less than one. By the definition
421:48 - of limit, if I go far enough to the right
on the x axis, all of my red dots are going
421:49 - to be trapped in between this epsilon interval
around L. In mathematical symbols, this means
421:50 - there exists a number capital N, such that
the absolute value of ratios, the thing that's
421:51 - a limiting to L is between L plus epsilon.
And minus epsilon, for all little n bigger
421:52 - than or equal to
421:53 - capital that
421:54 - I'm going to multiply all three sides of this
inequality by the absolute value of a sub
421:55 - little m, I'm going to focus on the right
end of the inequality, because ultimately,
421:56 - I want to prove that my series is absolutely
convergent. So it's going to be more useful
421:57 - to show that my terms are smaller than things
than to show that my terms are bigger than
421:58 - things. This inequality is true for all values
of little n that are bigger than or equal
421:59 - to capital N. So in particular, it's true
when little n equals capital N. The inequalities
422:00 - also true when little n is equal to capital
N plus one. Here, I've just plugged in capital
422:01 - N plus one for a little n here. And when I
plug it in here, I end up with capital N plus
422:02 - one plus one, which is capital N plus two.
Now if I string these two inequalities together,
422:03 - essentially, I'm substituting in this inequality,
right here, I get the following inequality,
422:04 - which simplifies to give me the absolute value
of a sub capital N plus two is less than l
422:05 - plus epsilon squared times the absolute value
of a sub capital N. Let's try this one more
422:06 - time. Going back to my original inequality
here, I'm going to plug in capital N plus
422:07 - two for lowercase n. And stringing these two
inequalities together, I get that this is
422:08 - less than l plus epsilon cube times the absolute
value of a piece of capital N. And in general,
422:09 - the same reasoning shows that the absolute
value of a sub capital N plus i is less than
422:10 - l plus epsilon to the i times the asset value
of a sub capital N. For any I. With all these
422:11 - inequalities, I'm gradually building up to
series. The first series is the series, the
422:12 - sum of the absolute value of a sub capital
N plus i. Let's start that from i equals one
422:13 - to infinity. And the second series is the
sum of L plus epsilon to the i times the absolute
422:14 - value of a so capital that again, let's start
from equals one to infinity. Now the second
422:15 - series is a geometric series, where r is equal
to L plus epsilon, which is less than one,
422:16 - because remember, we chose epsilon to make
sure that was
422:17 - less than one.
422:18 - Therefore, this series converges. But that's
great news. Because now looking at this inequality,
422:19 - we can show that series one converges, just
using the ordinary comparison test, and recognizing
422:20 - that these terms are bigger than or equal
to zero. So series one converges by the comparison
422:21 - test. But series one is just the tail end
of the series, the sum from n equals one to
422:22 - infinity absolute value of a sub little n.
So this series converges, because it's just
422:23 - finally many terms added on to a convergent
series. And so we've shown that our original
422:24 - series converges absolutely. This proves the
first part of the ratio test. Now let's prove
422:25 - the second part. And let's start by assuming
that the limit is greater than one. This time,
422:26 - since l is bigger than one, we can pick a
tiny number epsilon, so that when we go down
422:27 - from L by epsilon, we don't go as far as the
number one. So we're going to pick an epsilon
422:28 - greater than zero, such that l minus epsilon
is still greater than one. As before, we can
422:29 - use the definition of limit and a little algebra
to get the same inequality as we got before.
422:30 - This time, I'm going to focus on the left
side of the inequality though. Since l minus
422:31 - epsilon is greater than one. This tells me
in particular, that the absolute value of
422:32 - a sub n plus one is always bigger than the
absolute value of as little n for little n
422:33 - bigger than or equal to capital N. This means
that the absolute value of Ace of capital
422:34 - n is less than the absolute value of a sub
capital N plus one, which is less than the
422:35 - absolute value of capital A sub capital N
plus two, and so on. And so my sequence of
422:36 - terms is actually ultimately an increasing
sequence of positive numbers. So my sequence
422:37 - of terms cannot converge to zero, limit as
little n goes to infinity as the value of
422:38 - a sub little n cannot be zero. And so the
limit as little n goes to infinity of a sub
422:39 - little n cannot be zero either. But that means
that my original series cannot converge, it
422:40 - has to diverged by the divergence test, we
still have one detail that consider the possibility
422:41 - that the limit of the absolute value of ratios
is infinity. In this case, the argument that
422:42 - we just used, works almost exactly the same.
If we assume that the limit is infinity, then
422:43 - we can skip this part here.
422:44 - And here, and just note that there exists
some capital n such that the ratios are always
422:45 - bigger than say to for all little n bigger
than or equal to capital N. Since if the ratios
422:46 - are heading towards infinity, they're certainly
going to be bigger than two, eventually. This
422:47 - gives us the same inequality that we need,
I just read a two there. And now as before,
422:48 - we can conclude that a sub n plus one is absolute
value is strictly greater than a sub n is
422:49 - absolute value. In fact, it's greater than
twice of it for all little n bigger than equal
422:50 - to capital N. And we can make the same conclusion
about an increasing sequence of positive terms.
422:51 - That so that the terms can't go to zero, and
the series has to diverge by the divergence
422:52 - test. This concludes the proof of the ratio
test. In this video, we prove the convergent
422:53 - part of the ratio test by comparing our series
to a convergent geometric series, and we prove
422:54 - the divergent part of the ratio test using
the divergence test. This video is a review
422:55 - of all the convergence tests we've talked
about in class. I'll list the test roughly
422:56 - in the order that I would try to apply them.
I like to start with the divergence test.
422:57 - Usually it's pretty easy to check if the limit
as n goes to infinity of the terms is equal
422:58 - to zero. And if not, you're done because the
series diverges. Be careful though. The divergence
422:59 - test can only be used to check for divergence,
it cannot be used to prove convergence, because
423:00 - if the limits of the terms is equal to zero,
the series may converge, but it may still
423:01 - diverge. The next thing I do is to check if
the series is a simple p series, or a geometric
423:02 - series. Remember, a p series is a series of
the form one over n to the p n is our indexing
423:03 - variable P is some number like two or 5.8.
And this is easy to test for convergence since
423:04 - it converges. If p is greater than one and
it diverges, otherwise, a geometric series
423:05 - this is the kind of the form a times r to
the n, where A is the first term, and they
423:06 - start at zero here. So it's the really the
first term and r is the common ratio. And
423:07 - this one's easy to check to because it converges
if the absolute value of r is less than one
423:08 - and diverges otherwise. If the series happens
to be alternating, than the alternating test
423:09 - is a good one to apply next. Be careful, this
test can only be used to prove convergence.
423:10 - If the series is actually alternating. And
this what I call this step size, that's the
423:11 - absolute value of the terms is going to zero
and decreasing, then we can conclude that
423:12 - the series converges. But if some of those
conditions are not satisfied, we can't automatically
423:13 - assume that the series diverges. Well, not
at least by the alternating test, if the step
423:14 - size doesn't go to zero, then we should have
already figured out the series diverges by
423:15 - the divergence test were really, really applying
the divergence test there. And if the step
423:16 - size is not decreasing, not even ultimately
decreasing, then the alternating test is just
423:17 - inconclusive. It doesn't apply, we don't know
yet, whether it diverges or converges, and
423:18 - we have to look for another test. Now if the
series is not one of these nice p series geometric
423:19 - or alternating series, my go to test is going
to be the ratio test. The ratio test is especially
423:20 - good for series with n factorials in them
423:21 - or
423:22 - two to the ends and things with sort of geometric
pieces that are not strictly geometric are
423:23 - good candidates for the ratio test. But be
careful, the ratio test will be inconclusive
423:24 - for like all p like series, so series that
just have you know things like ends and, and
423:25 - maybe the square roots of ends and things
that can be easily compared to a p series
423:26 - are not good candidates for the ratio test.
So if you happen to remember that you can
423:27 - save some time by not trying the ratio test
on those. If the ratio test is not a good
423:28 - candidate or ends up being inconclusive, what
I might try next is one of the comparison
423:29 - tests.
423:30 - So that would be like what I call the ordinary
or the limit comparison test. We generally
423:31 - want to compare two series that we know a
lot about that we know the convergence status
423:32 - of so we would generally want to compare to
either p series or geometric series. The comparison
423:33 - tests are especially good for p like series
that the ratio test is inconclusive for. And
423:34 - to figure out what to compare to it's a good
rule of thumb to consider the dominant or
423:35 - highest power terms. One thing you need to
be aware of when applying the comparison test
423:36 - is that it only applies to series with positive
terms. Of course, the first few terms never
423:37 - matter for series convergence. So it's okay
to apply it if you have eventually positive
423:38 - terms. But if the terms never become always
positive, and they're not strictly alternating,
423:39 - so the alternating test doesn't apply. We
don't have to give up hope we can use the
423:40 - fact that absolute convergence implies convergence.
That's what I try and sort of mine since my
423:41 - seventh test to try. So you can just take
the absolute values of your terms and then
423:42 - maybe use the comparison test. And if that
works to prove convergence, then your original
423:43 - series will converge also. Another method
I haven't mentioned before is to use limit
423:44 - laws to split up the series. So if you have
the sum of two series, say a p series and
423:45 - a geometric series, then a natural thing to
do is to split this up as the sum of two series
423:46 - and use a different method for each piece.
If both pieces converge, like they do in this
423:47 - situation, then the psalm also converges.
Also, if one piece happens to converge on
423:48 - the other diverges, then the sun will diverged.
The only thing to be careful of is that if
423:49 - both pieces diverged, then the psalm may still
diverged. But it may converge because there
423:50 - might be cancellation, one piece might be
diverted into infinity and one piece may be
423:51 - diverging to negative infinity. And that's
an indeterminate kind of form. If none of
423:52 - this stuff has worked so far, I might look
to try the integral test and compare my series
423:53 - to an integral. This is especially handy in
my experience four series with logs in them.
423:54 - So something and also it has to be a series
where the integral of easy compute so you
423:55 - know, something like ln n over n, if you instead
look at the integral of ln x over x, that's
423:56 - pretty easy to compute using use substitution.
And so that would be a good candidate for
423:57 - the integral test. Be aware that the integral
test can only be used when the series terms
423:58 - can be thought of as the functions values
at integers for a function that is positive,
423:59 - continuous, and decreasing. Last on my list
is the method of telescoping series. I put
424:00 - it last only because it's kind of a hassle
to work with telescoping series, but it does
424:01 - have some good points. First of all, using
the method of telescoping series, you can
424:02 - actually compute the sum rather than just
tell if it converges or diverges. The only
424:03 - other tool on this list that will actually
compute the sum of an infinite series is the
424:04 - geometric series test where we have a formula
for the sum provided it converges. Another
424:05 - reason to use the telescoping series is if
you happen to notice that your terms are the
424:06 - difference of related expressions. So something
like the sum of e to the one over n plus one
424:07 - minus e to the one over N might be a good
candidate for telescoping series. Something
424:08 - like the sum of one over n squared minus one
would also be a reasonable candidate, because
424:09 - you can rewrite it using the method of partial
fractions. And using that method well, and
424:10 - the telescoping series stuff will help you
find an actual song. But if you just want
424:11 - to know convergence, it'll be a lot easier
just to use comparison to a p series whenever
424:12 - n squared for this one. So that's pretty much
everything I know about convergence tests
424:13 - for series. If you want to keep watching,
I'll take a look at some examples on the next
424:14 - page. Before you keep watching, please take
a moment to look at these six examples and
424:15 - decide which convergence or divergence test
you might try.
424:16 - Please be
424:17 - aware that for many of these series, there
are lots of tests that will work. So just
424:18 - because you pick a different one than I do
doesn't mean that yours is wrong. I think
424:19 - this first example can be conquered using
the divergence test. My hunch is if we took
424:20 - that limit and use lopi talls rule, we get
a limit of infinity not zero. An alternative
424:21 - though would be to use the ratio test. Because
this is
424:22 - a
424:23 - term that is has a geometric piece as well
as some other stuff. The second example is
424:24 - an alternating series. So my first try is
going to be the alternating series test. And
424:25 - my recollection is it does work to prove convergence
in this case. For this third one, this is
424:26 - the kind that I call a p like series, because
if I just look at the the dominant terms,
424:27 - the highest power terms, I could compare to
the P series, which is one over and squared
424:28 - cubed rooted or in other words, one over n
to the two thirds power. Since this one diverges,
424:29 - I'm gonna expect my original one also diverged,
I probably need to use the limit comparison
424:30 - test because I don't think the inequalities
will go the right direction for the ordinary
424:31 - comparison test. This next one's a perfect
candidate for splitting up into two pieces.
424:32 - This one, the second piece, I could use the
geometric series test to show convergence.
424:33 - And this first one says it has an n factorial
that's a great candidate for the ratio test.
424:34 - This next one's kind of tricky for me. At
first glance, I almost thought it would be
424:35 - a candidate for the integral test. If this
had just been an N instead of an n squared,
424:36 - I might be able to integrate using use substitution.
But because it's an n squared, the integral
424:37 - test would be more tricky to do or I might
have to do integration by parts or something.
424:38 - So I'm gonna stay away from that. And I'm
going to start by trying the ratio test because
424:39 - this does have a geometric kind of like piece
to it. And this last example, I'm going to
424:40 - use the integral test here because I know
like To integrate one over x ln x dx, using
424:41 - the use substitution u equals ln x, apply
and converge, the divergence test is something
424:42 - that takes practice, the more you do it, the
better you'll be at recognizing which tests
424:43 - might apply. But a lot of times, there's no
substitute for just trying the test. And if
424:44 - it doesn't work, it's where it's inconclusive.
Just try something else. Good luck, and see
424:45 - you in class. This video introduces some of
the ideas and key formulas of Taylor series.
424:46 - One of the main ideas behind Taylor series,
the idea of approximating functions with polynomials.
424:47 - So suppose we have some function f of x, we
want to approximate this function with a polynomial,
424:48 - and we'd like the approximation to be good
near x equals zero. And we're going to assume
424:49 - that f prime of zero exists, and f double
prime of zero exists, and F third derivative
424:50 - exists at zero, all of its derivatives, we're
gonna assume exists at x equals zero. Now,
424:51 - if we just want to get F value, right at zero,
424:52 - we can approximate F with the constant function,
y equals f of zero, we can think of this constant
424:53 - function as being a degrees zero polynomial
approximation. But it's a pretty lousy approximation,
424:54 - we can do much better than that, in fact,
we can do a lot better even if we just use
424:55 - a degree one polynomial, that's a linear function.
As you know, the tangent line at x equals
424:56 - zero is a linear function that provides a
pretty good approximation for the actual function
424:57 - when x is near zero least that's the best
approximation you can hope for out of a linear
424:58 - function. The equation for the tangent line
is given by y equals f of zero, plus f prime
424:59 - of zero times x. This comes straight from
the point slope form for a line where m is
425:00 - the slope of the tangent line, that's the
derivative at zero, and the point x one y
425:01 - one is just the point zero, f of zero. So
we get y minus f of zero is f prime of zero
425:02 - times x minus zero, which simplifies to that
equation for the tangent line right there.
425:03 - Notice that the tangent line has the same
value as f of x at x equals zero, and it has
425:04 - the same slope as f of x at x equals zero.
But I'd like to do a little better than this,
425:05 - I'd like to approximate my function f of x
with a polynomial that has the same value,
425:06 - the same slope or first derivative, and the
same second derivative as f of x at x equals
425:07 - zero. It turns out, I can do this with a degree
two polynomial. And I'll show you how, in
425:08 - general, a degree two polynomial, also called
a quadratic is a polynomial of the form P
425:09 - of x equals c sub zero, plus c sub one times
x, plus c sub two times x squared. And I just
425:10 - have to figure out what values of the constants
C sub zero, c sub one, c sub two, will make
425:11 - my polynomial, agree with my function in its
value, first derivative and second derivative.
425:12 - Well, if I want P of zero to equal f of zero,
and that means I want c sub zero plus c sub
425:13 - one times zero plus c sub two times zero squared
to equal s value at zero. In other words,
425:14 - c sub zero had better be equal to f of zero.
But now I also want p prime of zero to equal
425:15 - f prime of zero. P prime of x is equal to
c sub one plus two times c sub 2x. I'm just
425:16 - using my derivative rules on the equation
for p remembering that my C's are constants.
425:17 - Therefore, to evaluate p prime of zero, I
just plug in zero for x, and I get c sub one,
425:18 - but this needs to equal f prime of zero, and
therefore c sub one is equal to f prime of
425:19 - zero. Finally, I want p double prime of zero
to equal f double prime at
425:20 - zero, I can
425:21 - find p double prime of x by taking the derivative
of my derivative, so that gives me two times
425:22 - C two, but that needs to equal f double prime
of zero means that C two had better equal
425:23 - f double prime of zero divided by two. So
now let's look what happened, requiring that
425:24 - P has the same value as zero as f forces c
sub zero to have the value of f of zero, requiring
425:25 - that the polynomial and F had the same first
derivative zero, forces the value of CS of
425:26 - one, two equal f prime of zero, and requiring
that the polynomial and the function have
425:27 - the same second derivative at zero forces
the value of c two to be f double prime of
425:28 - zero divided by two. So we've shown that there
is a secondary polynomial that has the same
425:29 - value first derivative, the second derivative
as F at X equals zero, and there's a unique
425:30 - such polynomial, and it's given by p of x
equals f of zero,
425:31 - plus f prime of zero times x, plus f double
prime of zero over two times x squared.
425:32 - Visually, that second degree polynomials going
to look like a parabola, it might look something
425:33 - like this. Let's play this game again. But
this time, I want to find a degree three polynomial
425:34 - p of x, such that P of zero is the same as
f of zero, p prime of zero is the same thing
425:35 - as f prime of zero, p double prime of zero
is equal to f double prime of zero, and peas,
425:36 - third derivative at zero is the same as F,
third derivative at zero.
425:37 - Graphically, that's going to be a cubic polynomial
that approximates my function, and it's going
425:38 - to be a pretty close approximation. We know
that a three three polynomial in general has
425:39 - the form c sub zero plus c sub 1x, plus c
sub 2x squared plus c sub 3x cubed. And we
425:40 - need to find the values of all the constant
C's. Please pause the video and see if you
425:41 - can figure out the values of those constants,
especially the value of c sub three in terms
425:42 - of the value of f and its derivatives at zero.
If we write down the derivatives of P, we
425:43 - get the following expressions. And if we evaluate
these expressions at x equals zero, all the
425:44 - terms with x's in them vanish. So we get these
expressions. Now, because we want our polynomials
425:45 - value, and its derivatives to match the value
and derivatives of our function, we get these
425:46 - equations from which we can solve for our
constants, c sub zero is f of zero, c sub
425:47 - one is f prime of zero, c sub two is f double
prime of zero over two, and c sub three is
425:48 - the third derivative of f at zero divided
by six. Notice that that number six came from
425:49 - multiplying three times two, and that three
and that two came from bringing down my success
425:50 - of exponents, when I took derivatives, we
can keep track of this process by rewriting
425:51 - c sub three is the third derivative of f of
zero divided by three times two or three factorial.
425:52 - So the third degree polynomial that approximates
our function is p of x, which is f of zero,
425:53 - plus f prime of zero times x plus f double
prime of zero over two times x squared, plus
425:54 - f third derivative at zero over three factorial
times x cubed. I'll write this as P sub three
425:55 - to remember it's the third degree polynomial.
We can repeat this process to get a fourth
425:56 - degree polynomial whose value add zero is
the same as f of zero, and whose first four
425:57 - derivatives at zero are the same as f first
for derivatives at zero. Please pause the
425:58 - video and either work out expressions for
the coefficients of peace and four, or else
425:59 - make an educated guess what those coefficients
should be based on the patterns you say. You
426:00 - should get the fourth degree polynomial has
the same first terms as a third degree polynomial
426:01 - and has a final term of f, fourth derivative
at zero over four factorial times x to the
426:02 - fourth. If we continue this process forever
Finding polynomials of higher and higher degree
426:03 - that match more and more derivatives of f.
Then in the limit, we'll have infinitely many
426:04 - terms that look like this. This is an infinite
series, and it can be written in summation
426:05 - notation as the sum from n equals zero to
infinity of the nth derivative of f at zero,
426:06 - divided by n factorial times x to the nth
power. This works as long as we use the conventions,
426:07 - that the zeroeth derivative means just the
function that zero factorial is equal to one,
426:08 - and that x to the zero is just equal to one,
even if x is zero. This infinite series is
426:09 - called the Maclaurin series for f of x. And
it's also called the Taylor series for f of
426:10 - x centered at x equals zero. Now, so far,
we've been focusing on the value of f and
426:11 - its derivatives at x equals zero. What if
we wanted to approximate f of x near x equals
426:12 - a, please pause the video and write down what
you think the Taylor series centered at x
426:13 - equals A should look like. This is a series
I'll call it T of x, that we want to match
426:14 - F's value
426:15 - at A.
426:16 - and we want all of its derivatives to match
f derivatives at a, it makes sense that this
426:17 - series should have a formula similar to the
formula we just found. But it should involve
426:18 - derivatives at a instead of derivatives at
zero. In addition, the formula needs to involve
426:19 - powers of x minus a, instead of powers of
x. I'll leave you to think about the details.
426:20 - And to verify that this series really does
have the derivatives that we wanted to have.
426:21 - In this video, we tried to approximate a function
by polynomials that had the same value and
426:22 - derivatives at x equals zero. And we ended
up with a formula for a Taylor series at x
426:23 - equals zero, which we generalized to a Taylor
series centered at x equals a. This video
426:24 - defines power series. informally, a power
series is a series with a variable in it,
426:25 - often the letter X, and it looks like a polynomial
with infinitely many terms. For example, if
426:26 - we look at the series, the sum from n equals
zero to infinity of two n plus one times x
426:27 - to the n over three to the n minus one, that's
a power series with variable x. If we expand
426:28 - that out by plugging in values of n, we get
one n equals 01 times x to the zero over three
426:29 - to the minus 1x to the zero is one and three
to the minus one on the denominator is the
426:30 - same as three on the numerator. So we can
rewrite this term as just three. The next
426:31 - term, when n equals one, is three times x
to the one over three to the zero, we can
426:32 - rewrite this as 3x, since three to the zero
is one. The next term is 5x squared over three,
426:33 - and we can continue like this. I want to point
out that when working with power series, x
426:34 - to the zero is always taken to be one, even
though there's a possibility that x could
426:35 - end up being zero, and zero to the zero is
considered undefined in other contexts. When
426:36 - working with power series, x to the zero for
any value of x is one. The next series expands
426:37 - out to one plus five times x minus six, and
so on. This is an example of a power series
426:38 - centered at six because of all the factors
of x minus six. In general, a power series
426:39 - centered at a is a series of the form the
sum from n equals zero to infinity of c sub
426:40 - n times x minus a to the n, where x is the
variable. The cease events are real numbers,
426:41 - they're constants, called the coefficients,
and a is also a real number a constant that's
426:42 - called the center. If I expand out the power
series and read out the first few terms that
426:43 - looks like this, where c sub zero is the constant
term, notice that x minus A to the zero is
426:44 - taken to be one, even when x equals a. If
the power series is centered at zero, then
426:45 - we just set a equal to zero, we can write
this a little more efficiently in the following
426:46 - form. Sometimes you might see a power series
that starts with index of one instead of zero.
426:47 - That's perfectly legit. It just means there's
no constant term. Or if you prefer, you can
426:48 - think of the constant term as being zero.
It's also fun for the index to start at some
426:49 - other positive number.
426:50 - But it's not considered a power series if
the index starts at a negative number, resulting
426:51 - in x's in the denominator. That's all for
the definition of power series. Recall that
426:52 - a power series is a series with a variable
in it. In this example, the C sub n and the
426:53 - A are supposed to be real numbers that are
held constant, so the only variable is x.
426:54 - That's the only place where I can plug in
different values at different times. This
426:55 - video explores the question of for what values
of the variable x does the power series converge,
426:56 - and for what values of x does it diverged.
Let's look at a few examples. First, for what
426:57 - values of x does this power series converge.
There's one value of x that I know for sure
426:58 - it converges for, please pause the video for
a moment and try to guess which value of x
426:59 - I'm thinking of the series definitely converges
when x equals three. If I expand out the first
427:00 - few terms of the series, I get this expression.
then plugging in three 4x, all of my terms
427:01 - vanish to zero, except for my constant term
of one. So at x equals three, the series converges
427:02 - to its constant turn. And in fact, this is
true of any power series all power series
427:03 - converge at their center. But let's see what
other values of exit converges for. Although
427:04 - we have many tests for convergence in our
toolkit, the ratio test is usually the best
427:05 - test to use to determine where of power series
converges. For the ratio test, we need to
427:06 - take the limit as n goes to infinity of the
absolute value of the ratio of consecutive
427:07 - terms. For our example, this is n plus one
factorial times x minus three to the n plus
427:08 - one divided by n factorial times x minus three
to the N. Let's simplify by canceling things.
427:09 - We get n plus one, times x minus three. Now
x minus three is some number. And I'll assume
427:10 - it's a nonzero number, since I already dealt
with the case when x equals three, so I have
427:11 - a nonzero number that stays fixed as n goes
to infinity times a number that's going to
427:12 - infinity. So the absolute value of the product
has to go to infinity, no matter what x value
427:13 - we have, other than the x value of three.
The ratio test says that if this limit is
427:14 - infinity, the series diverges. Therefore,
the power series diverges for all values of
427:15 - x except for three. The only place where it
converges is at the center of three. In this
427:16 - next example, the center of this series is
negative four. So the series definitely converges
427:17 - when x equals negative four. Let's use the
ratio test to figure out what other values
427:18 - of x make it converge. So we'll take the limit
as n goes to infinity of the absolute value
427:19 - of a sub n plus one over a sub n. This works
out to the limit the absolute value of negative
427:20 - two to the n plus one times x plus four to
the n plus one divided by n plus one factorial,
427:21 - all over negative two to the n x plus four
to the n over n factorial. Let's simplify
427:22 - by flipping and multiplying and rearranging
a little. After canceling, we get the limit
427:23 - of the opposite value of negative two times
x plus four divided by n plus one. The numerator
427:24 - of this expression doesn't depend on an n,
so it stays fixed as n goes to infinity, but
427:25 - the denominator goes to infinity. Therefore,
we're dividing some fixed constant by larger
427:26 - and larger numbers, and so this limit is equal
to zero. Once again, the limit doesn't depend
427:27 - on x as value It's always zero no matter what
axis. So by the ratio test zero is less than
427:28 - one, the series converges for all values of
x.
427:29 - Here's our third and last example, in this
example, it's a little trickier to figure
427:30 - out what the center is, one thing we can do
is to rewrite the series in a more standard
427:31 - form by factoring out the negative five, then
we get negative five times x minus two fifths,
427:32 - all raised to the nth power over N, I can
rewrite this again as negative five to the
427:33 - n times x minus two fifths to the n over n.
And in this more standard form, it's easy
427:34 - to recognize that the center is two fifths.
Another way to find the center is just to
427:35 - figure out the value of x, that makes terms
go to zero. So in our case, if we want negative
427:36 - 5x plus two, two equals zero, we need X to
equal two fifths. And therefore, two fifths
427:37 - must be the center, like we found before.
In any case, our series converges for x equals
427:38 - two fifths, for sure, but it might converge
for other values of x. So let's use the ratio
427:39 - test. To find other values of x that make
the series converge. We start off the same
427:40 - way as usual, by taking a limit of a ratio
of the n plus one than n terms. And then we
427:41 - simplify by flipping and multiplying. And
after canceling, we get the limit of negative
427:42 - 5x plus two times n over n plus one as n goes
to infinity, and over n plus one goes to one.
427:43 - And negative 5x plus two doesn't depend on
n. So this final limit is just the absolute
427:44 - value of negative 5x plus two. So by the ratio
test, our series converges when this limit
427:45 - is less than one, and it diverges when the
limit is greater than one, the ratio test
427:46 - is inconclusive when the absolute value of
negative 5x plus two is exactly equal to one,
427:47 - so we'll worry about that case later. Let's
solve the first absolute value inequality.
427:48 - When the absolute value of something is less
than one, that means that the quantity inside
427:49 - the absolute value sign has to be between
one and negative one. So we can rewrite the
427:50 - absolute value inequality as negative one
is less than negative 5x plus two, which is
427:51 - less than one, we can solve this for x by
subtracting two and dividing by negative five.
427:52 - dividing by a negative number reverses the
direction of the inequality signs. So we have
427:53 - that our series converges for these values
of x. Now let's solve the second absolute
427:54 - value and equality. The one that tells us
where the power series diverges, the series
427:55 - diverges when the absolute value of negative
5x plus two is greater than one. When the
427:56 - absolute value of something is greater than
one, that means that whatever is inside the
427:57 - absolute value sign has to either be less
than negative one or greater than one. So
427:58 - we can replace our absolute value in equality
with two inequalities. Negative 5x plus two
427:59 - is less than negative one, or negative 5x
plus two is greater than one. Let's solve
428:00 - these inequalities by subtracting two and
dividing by negative five. And similarly on
428:01 - the other side. So our series diverges when
x is greater than three fifths or less than
428:02 - 1/5. That makes sense, it's kind of the opposite
of where it converges because we're solving
428:03 - an absolute value inequality with the opposite
inequality side. Putting all this information
428:04 - together, we see that our series converges
when x is between 1/5 and three fifths and
428:05 - divert On either side of this interval,
428:06 - we still don't know what happens when x is
exactly equal to 1/5, or exactly equal to
428:07 - three fifths, since those values correspond
to the case when the ratio test is inconclusive.
428:08 - So let's turn our attention to the x values
of 1/5 and three fifths Next, let me write
428:09 - down our original power series, it was the
sum from n equals one to infinity of negative
428:10 - 5x plus two to the n
428:11 - over n.
428:12 - If we want to know if this power series converges
at x equals 1/5, let's just plug in x equals
428:13 - 1/5. This simplifies to the sum of one to
the n over n, which is just the regular harmonic
428:14 - series, which diverges. If we plug in x equals
three fifths, we get this series, which simplifies
428:15 - to the alternating harmonic series. So it
converges. So now we know that the series
428:16 - converges when x equals three fifths and diverges
when x equals 1/5. And our final answer is
428:17 - that the power series converges on the interval
from 1/5 to three fifths, where we use an
428:18 - open bracket, to denote that we exclude the
endpoint 1/5, because the series diverges
428:19 - there, and the closed bracket, square bracket
means that we include the endpoint of three
428:20 - fifths where the series does converge. I want
to make one more observation. Before we leave
428:21 - this example. Notice that the midpoint of
this interval is the number 2/5. Remember,
428:22 - at the beginning of the problem, we calculated
the center of the power series, and it was
428:23 - also two fifths. We'll see in a moment that
this is no coincidence. In fact, the interval
428:24 - of convergence is always centered at the center
of the power series. And we could in fact,
428:25 - describe the interior of this interval of
convergence as the x values for which x minus
428:26 - that center is less than 1/5. Bet is all x
values within a distance of 1/5. From the
428:27 - interval center. We've seen three examples
of power series, and each one converge in
428:28 - a very different way. In general, it turns
out that there are only these three different
428:29 - types of convergence that we've already seen.
It's possible, like we saw on the first example,
428:30 - that a series might converge only at its center.
It's also possible that a power series could
428:31 - converge for all values of x. This is what
happened in our second example. But if neither
428:32 - of these two cases hold, then the only other
possibility is that there exists a number
428:33 - R, such that R is series converges anytime,
where within our units from the center a and
428:34 - the power series diverges for any x values
that are more than our units from the center
428:35 - array. In symbols, I can right there exists
a number are such that the power series converges
428:36 - when the absolute value of x minus a is less
than R, and diverges when the absolute value
428:37 - of x minus a is greater than R, since the
absolute value of x minus a represents the
428:38 - distance between x and a. This was a situation
we saw in our third example. Now in the first
428:39 - case, we say that the radius of convergence
of the power series is zero. In the second
428:40 - example, we say the radius of convergence
is infinity. And in the third example, we
428:41 - say the radius of convergence is our since
our represents the distance from the center
428:42 - of the interval, sort of like the radius of
a circle represents the circles distance from
428:43 - the center. Now the interval of convergence
is the interval of all x values for which
428:44 - the power series converges. So in our first
situation, the interval of convergence is
428:45 - just the number a it's not really an interval,
just a single number, but we call it the interval
428:46 - of convergence anyway, in the second situation,
our interval of convergence is the interval
428:47 - from now negative infinity to infinity. And
then the third situation, the interval of
428:48 - convergence includes this entire interval
here that extends from the number A minus
428:49 - r to the number A plus R.
428:50 - So our interval could be the open interval,
a minus r to a plus R. But it could also include
428:51 - one or more endpoints, so it could be the
closed interval, or it could just include
428:52 - the left endpoint, or just the right endpoint.
In this video, I worked out some examples
428:53 - using the ratio test to figure out what x
values make a power series converge. I also
428:54 - stated the fact that there are only three
options for convergence of a power series,
428:55 - convergence at the center only convergence
for all real numbers and convergence on some
428:56 - finite interval centered at the center of
the power series. This video gives an example
428:57 - of computing the interval of convergence and
the radius of convergence for a power series.
428:58 - To compute the radius of convergence and interval
of convergence for this power series, we start
428:59 - by using the ratio test. So we need to find
the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute
429:00 - value of a sub n plus one over a sub n, where
the a sub ns are the terms for this power
429:01 - series, we can compute a sub n plus one, by
just plugging in n plus one everywhere we
429:02 - see an N in this expression. So that's negative
four to the n plus one, times x minus eight
429:03 - to the two times quantity and plus one divided
by n plus one. We divide all that by the A
429:04 - sub N term, which is just negative four to
the n x minus eight to the to n over n, which
429:05 - I've just copied from the formula here. Now
I'm going to simplify, flip and multiply.
429:06 - And now I'm going to rearrange terms so that
corresponding terms are on top of each other.
429:07 - So I'm going to write negative four to the
n plus one over negative four to the n times
429:08 - x minus eight
429:09 - to the
429:10 - to quantity n plus one, that's the same thing
as two n plus two, over x minus eight to the
429:11 - two n. And then I'll write the N and N plus
one. So that's n over n plus one. Once I cancel
429:12 - terms, I get the limit of negative four times
x minus eight squared times n over n plus
429:13 - one. Now, as n goes to infinity, n over n
plus one is going to one, and the absolute
429:14 - value of negative four is just four. And the
absolute value of x minus eight squared is
429:15 - just going to be x minus eight squared, since
this expression is always positive, so we
429:16 - have our limit. And the ratio test says the
series will converge where this limit is less
429:17 - than one. So next, let's set four times x
minus eight squared to be less than one and
429:18 - solve for x. In other words, x minus a squared
is less than 1/4. Now we can't solve this
429:19 - quadratic inequality by taking the square
root of both sides, that would lead to something
429:20 - like x minus eight is less than plus or minus
the square root of 1/4, which doesn't even
429:21 - make any sense. And it's not true. What we
can do instead is solve the quadratic equation,
429:22 - x minus eight squared is equal to 1/4. And
then use some logic to figure out the inequality.
429:23 - So now that we have an equation sign, we can
take the square root of both sides to get
429:24 - x minus eight is is equal to plus or minus
the square root of 1/4. In other words, x
429:25 - minus eight is plus or minus one half. So
in other words, x is equal to eight plus one
429:26 - half, or eight minus one half. That's either
17 halves, or 15 halves. Now let's go back
429:27 - to the inequality that we're interested in.
Since we know that x minus eight squared is
429:28 - equal to 1/4. At x values of 15 halves and
17 halves, we can test to see whether x minus
429:29 - eight squared is bigger or smaller than 1/4.
by plugging in values in between these numbers,
429:30 - so when x is less than 15, half just by plugging
in a sample value like zero, we can see that
429:31 - x minus eight squared will be bigger than
1/4. Well, when x is between 15 halves and
429:32 - 17 halves, say the value of eight, the plug
in eight and 4x, and see that eight minus
429:33 - eight squared, which is zero, is going to
be less than 1/4. And finally, plugging in
429:34 - a value of x over here, maybe something like
10 for x, we're going to get a value of x
429:35 - minus eight squared, that is, again, bigger
than 1/4. So putting this together, we can
429:36 - see that x minus eight squared is less than
1/4. When x is between 15 halves, and 17 halves.
429:37 - So by the ratio test, our series converges.
For x between 15 halves, and 17 halves the
429:38 - ratio test also tells us the series diverges.
When this expression is greater than one in
429:39 - order other words, x minus eight squared is
greater than 1/4. In other words, for x values
429:40 - less than 15 halves are greater than 17 halves.
Now the only thing we still need to figure
429:41 - out is what happens at the endpoints of the
interval 15 halves to 17 half's recall that
429:42 - our series was given by this formula. So when
x is equal to 15 halves, we have negative
429:43 - four to the n 15 halves minus eight to the
to n over n, which is equal to negative four
429:44 - to the n, negative one half to the two n over
n, which I can rewrite as negative one to
429:45 - the n times four to the n times negative one
to the two N over two to the to n divided
429:46 - by n, which is the same thing as negative
one to the n four to the n, negative one to
429:47 - the two n divided by n times two squared to
the N. Since two n is always even negative
429:48 - one to the two, n is always equal to one.
And since two squared is four, this four to
429:49 - the n on the denominator cancels with the
four to the n on the numerator. So I'm left
429:50 - with the alternating harmonic series, which
we know converges. So the series converges
429:51 - for x equal to 15 halves. Now at x equals
17 halves, we can go through the same computation,
429:52 - just using 17 halves in place of 15 halves,
that changes the negative one half here to
429:53 - a positive one half. And now we have a positive
one to the two n, which is still always one,
429:54 - everything else works the same. And so we
still have a conversion series. So going back
429:55 - up to the top, we know that the series actually
converges for x greater than or equal to 15
429:56 - halves and less than or equal to 17 halves.
That is our interval of convergence. closed
429:57 - bracket 50 and a half to 17 halves close bracket.
That is that the interval of convergence has
429:58 - length one, because 17 halves minus 15 halves,
the difference of the two endpoints is two
429:59 - halves, which is one also, the interval of
convergence has center of eight because the
430:00 - average of the endpoints 17 halves plus 15
halves
430:01 - over two
430:02 - is equal to eight. This should come as no
surprise, because our original series was
430:03 - centered at eight. So if we draw our interval
of convergence on the number line, it's centered
430:04 - at eight, and extends out a total distance
of one unit. In other words, it extends out
430:05 - by half a unit on either side. And so the
radius of convergence is the length of the
430:06 - interval divided by two, or one half. So we
found the radius of convergence. And we found
430:07 - the interval of convergence, which was this
closed interval here. And so that completes
430:08 - the problem. In this video, I'll prove some
of the key facts about convergence of power
430:09 - series. My ultimate goal is to prove that
there are only three possible options for
430:10 - convergence, a power series could converge
only at its center, it could converge for
430:11 - all real numbers. And if these two options
don't hold, then there must exist a number
430:12 - are
430:13 - such that the power series converges for all
x, within our units away from the center a
430:14 - and the power series diverges.
430:15 - for all x,
430:16 - his distance from a is greater than our first
I'll prove some preliminary facts. I'll start
430:17 - with this one. If a power series converges
when x is equal to b, for some nonzero number
430:18 - B, then it also converges for any x whose
absolute value is less than the absolute value
430:19 - of b. To prove this fact, let's assume that
the power series converges when x is equal
430:20 - to b, that is, the sum of c sub n times beats
to the n converges.
430:21 - If a series converges, then the limit of its
terms has to equal zero. Since if the limit
430:22 - of the terms is not equal to zero, the series
would have to diverged by the divergence test.
430:23 - Therefore, by the definition of limit, for
any epsilon, there exists a number capital
430:24 - N, such that c sub n times b to the n is between
zero plus epsilon, and zero minus epsilon
430:25 - for little n bigger than or equal to capital
N. In particular, if we pick epsilon equal
430:26 - to one, this says there exists a capital n
such that negative one is less than c sub
430:27 - n times b to the n is less than one for little
n bigger than or equal to capital N, I can
430:28 - rewrite this statement as the absolute value
of c sub n times b to the n is less than one
430:29 - for little n bigger than or equal to capital
N. Now, if x is any number, with absolute
430:30 - value less than the absolute value of b, we
can write the absolute value of c sub n times
430:31 - x to the n as the absolute value of c sub
n times b to the n times x over a b to the
430:32 - n, just using algebra, I can rewrite this
as c sub as the value of c sub n times b to
430:33 - the n times the absolute value of x over b
430:34 - to the n.
430:35 - For little n bigger than or equal to capital
N, we know that the opposite value of c sub
430:36 - n times b to the n is less than one.
430:37 - So this expression has to be less than the
absolute value of x over b to the n. Now if
430:38 - the absolute value of x is less than the absolute
value of b, this means that the absolute value
430:39 - of x over b is less than one. So the series
The sum of X absolute value of x over b to
430:40 - the n is a geometric series, whose ratio has
absolute value less than one, so it's a convergent
430:41 - series. Now, the ordinary comparison test
tells us that the sum of the absolute value
430:42 - of c sub n, x to the n also converges, because
we know that the terms of that series are
430:43 - less than the terms of our convergent geometric
series. Therefore, our original series The
430:44 - sum of c sub n, x to the n converges absolutely,
and therefore converges. So we've proved the
430:45 - first statement. The second statement says
that if the power series diverges when x is
430:46 - equal to d for some nonzero number D, then
it also diverges. Whenever we have an x whose
430:47 - absolute value is greater than the absolute
value of D. The statement follows directly
430:48 - from the first statement, because suppose
we have the sum of c sub n times d to the
430:49 - n diverges. If the absolute value of x is
bigger than the absolute value of d, and the
430:50 - sum of c sub n x to the n converged, then
by part one, the sum of c sub n, d to the
430:51 - n would have to converge, since the absolute
value of d is less than the absolute value
430:52 - of x. But this contradicts the assumption
that the sum of c sub n times d to the n diverges.
430:53 - And therefore, we know that the sum of c sub
n times x to the n must diverged after all.
430:54 - That's all for the proof of facts about convergence
of series. In this video, we'll talk about
430:55 - power series as functions. Consider the function
defined by f of x is equal to the sum from
430:56 - n equals zero to infinity of x to the n. This
can also be written as one plus x plus x squared,
430:57 - and so on. When we think of this as a function,
the variable x becomes our independent variable,
430:58 - or input variable. So to figure out the values
of f, we can plug in numbers for x and evaluate.
430:59 - Please pause the video and calculate F of
1/3. f of 1/3 is equal to one plus a third
431:00 - plus a third squared, and so on, this is a
geometric series. So it adds up to the first
431:01 - term one divided by one minus the ratio of
1/3. And that simplifies to three halfs. Next
431:02 - question, what's the domain of f of x, we
can think of the domain of a function as the
431:03 - values of the input variable x, that give
us a real number as output? Please pause the
431:04 - video to write down your answer for the domain
of f of x. The series, the sum of x to the
431:05 - n converges when x is between negative one
and one. So for these values of x, we get
431:06 - a finite real number as our answer for f of
x. Also, the series diverges for other values
431:07 - of x. So we don't get a real number answer
when we plug in values of x less than or equal
431:08 - to negative one or greater than or equal to
one. Therefore, the domain of f of x is the
431:09 - set of X values for which negative one is
less than x is less than one, or an interval
431:10 - notation, we can write this as the interval
from negative one to one.
431:11 - And in general, the domain of a power series
is exactly the set of values where it converges.
431:12 - By a closed form expression for f of x, I
mean an expression that doesn't involve a
431:13 - summation sign,
431:14 - I can write the sum of X to the N, without
the summation sign by using the geometric
431:15 - series formula, first term is one divided
by one minus the common ratio of x. This holds
431:16 - for all x values between negative one and
one as usual, where the geometric series converges.
431:17 - Therefore, I can write f of x as one over
one minus x for x values in that interval.
431:18 - Notice that if I just looked at the function,
g of x equals one over one minus x out of
431:19 - context, it would have domain spanning from
negative infinity to one together with the
431:20 - interval one to infinity. Because this function
g of x is defined for all x values that are
431:21 - not equal to one. So f of x and g of x are
not exactly the same function. They have different
431:22 - domains, but they are exactly equal on the
interval from negative one to one. And we
431:23 - say that the function g of x is represented
by the power series, the sum from n equals
431:24 - zero to infinity of x to the n. If we want
to be more precise, we can say it's represented
431:25 - by this power series 4x between negative one
and one. We can think of the partial sums
431:26 - of this series sum of x to the n as a way
to approximate the function, one over one
431:27 - minus x with polynomials. Please pause the
video and write out the first few partial
431:28 - sums, your answers should have Xs. S sub zero
is just the zeroeth term one, S sub one is
431:29 - one plus x, and so on. s sub n is one plus
x plus all the way up through x to the n,
431:30 - an nth degree polynomial. In this figure,
I've drawn the function one over one minus
431:31 - x in blue. And I've drawn the first partial
sum the linear function one plus x in orange.
431:32 - Notice that these two functions are close
to each other when x equals zero, but get
431:33 - farther away from each other when x is far
from zero. In this graph, I've added the next
431:34 - partial sum s two, which is a degree two polynomial,
a quadratic. Here I've got partial sums through
431:35 - s four. And here I've got partial sums through
about s 12. The original function one over
431:36 - one minus x is here in blue on mark over
431:37 - Ed.
431:38 - And you can see that these partial sums are
becoming very good approximations to that
431:39 - original function on the interval from negative
one to one. Now outside that interval, for
431:40 - example, for x values below negative one,
431:41 - our partial sums deviate wildly from our original
function. I want to show one more graph. In
431:42 - this graph, the function one over one minus
x is shown in blue. And the graph of the power
431:43 - series, the sum of X to the N is shown in
orange,
431:44 - the blue function is actually obscured by
the orange function because the two functions
431:45 - are identical for values of x between negative
one and one. The only difference between these
431:46 - two functions, as discussed before, is that
the function one over one minus x is defined
431:47 - for all x values except for the x value of
one. And that's why we can see the blue graph
431:48 - even when x values are less than negative
one. However, the function given by this power
431:49 - series has domain in between negative one
and one, and so it only exists here in between
431:50 - those x values. In this video, I talked about
representing the function one over one minus
431:51 - x with the power series, the sum from n equals
zero to infinity of x to the n. These two
431:52 - progressions are equal for x values between
negative one where the power series converges.
431:53 - I also used a graph to give an idea of what
this equation means. The partial sums drawn
431:54 - in various colors give excellent approximations
to the original function drawn in blue on
431:55 - the interval of X values between negative
one and one. Since the partial sums are polynomials,
431:56 - this gives us a way to approximate this rational
function with simple polynomial equations.
431:57 - The idea of approximating functions with polynomials
is a very important idea that we'll see again
431:58 - and again. This video is about rewriting functions
in terms of power series. All the examples
431:59 - that we'll do in this section will be based
on the formula for the geometric series, the
432:00 - fact that the sum from n equals zero to infinity
of x to the n is equal to one over one minus
432:01 - x. For x between negative one and one. We
want to express the function two over x minus
432:02 - three as a power series. And we want to do
this by using the geometric sum formula. The
432:03 - trick here is going to be to rewrite to over
x minus three, so it looks more like one over
432:04 - one minus something, then we can treat whatever
that something is as x and plug into the formula
432:05 - to get a power series. So that's the idea.
Now I'm starting with two over x minus three.
432:06 - And I don't really like the X minus three,
I'd rather This was three minus
432:07 - x because that reminds me more of one minus
x. So I could rewrite it like this, but my
432:08 - two expressions now are equal. This one's
the negative of this one, so I can fix that
432:09 - by just sticking a negative sign out in front.
Now my two expressions are equal, because
432:10 - I've just multiplied my first expression by
negative one over negative one. To get this
432:11 - expression, but I still don't really like
the three minus x, I wish that were one minus
432:12 - x, it'd be nice if I could just divide the
three by three to get one. But in order to
432:13 - leave the expression on change, I'm going
to need to divide everything by three, both
432:14 - the top and the bottom. This gives me negative
two thirds, divided by three minus x over
432:15 - three, which I can also write as negative
two thirds times one minus x over three. Now
432:16 - if I bring the negative two thirds out front,
I have negative two thirds times one over
432:17 - one minus x over three. Using my geometric
sum formula, this is the same as negative
432:18 - two thirds times the sum from n equals zero
to infinity of x over three to the n, I'm
432:19 - just plugging in x over three 4x. In this
formula, I've now found a power series representation.
432:20 - But I'm going to clean it up a little bit
and make it look more standard, bring the
432:21 - negative two thirds into the summation sign
and distributed my exponent to get x to the
432:22 - n over three to the N. And now I can rewrite
this as negative two over three to the n plus
432:23 - one, times x to the n. To figure out the interval
of convergence for this power series, there
432:24 - are two different approaches that I could
take. First, I could do a standard computation
432:25 - using the ratio test. I'll let you work out
the details yourself. But you should get that
432:26 - the radius of convergence is three, and the
interval of convergence is from negative three
432:27 - to three.
432:28 - A second approach to finding the interval
of convergence is to look at the history of
432:29 - how we made the power series.
432:30 - Our basic template power series was the sum
from n equals zero to infinity of x to the
432:31 - n, which converges when x is between negative
one and one. We then plugged in x over three
432:32 - for x. Well, this good should converge when
x over three is between one and negative one.
432:33 - In other words, when x is between three and
negative three, finally, we multiplied that
432:34 - series by negative two thirds. This doesn't
change the interval of convergence. So the
432:35 - interval of convergence for our final power
series is the interval between negative three
432:36 - and three, just like you could have gotten
from the ratio test. As a second example,
432:37 - let's find a power series representation of
x over one plus 5x squared. Again, we want
432:38 - to use the geometric series summation formula.
So we want to make this expression look more
432:39 - like one over one minus something. Well, one
plus 5x squared is the same thing as one minus
432:40 - minus 5x squared. So if I just wanted a power
series for one over one plus 5x squared, I
432:41 - could do that easily by using the geometric
sum formula, and getting the sum from n equals
432:42 - zero to infinity of minus 5x squared to the
N. All I'm doing here is plugging in negative
432:43 - 5x squared for x in this formula. Since I
want a power series for x over one plus 5x
432:44 - squared, instead, I can just multiply everything
by x. Again, I'd like to clean things up and
432:45 - make this expression look more like a standard
power series. So I'll drag the x inside the
432:46 - summation sign, I can do that because the
summation is over n, which has nothing to
432:47 - do with x. Now I can use my laws of exponents
to rewrite this as negative one to the n five
432:48 - to the n times x to the two n. Now, x times
x to the two n is equal to x to the two n
432:49 - plus one. And so this gives me a good power
series representation for my function. Although
432:50 - the problem didn't explicitly ask for it,
it's a good idea to compute the interval of
432:51 - convergence to see for what values of x
432:52 - this equation actually holds. I'll use the
history approach. We started with our old
432:53 - familiar power series, which converges when
x is between one and negative one
432:54 - with plugged in net Get a 5x squared for x.
So that converges when negative one is less
432:55 - than negative 5x squared is less than one,
which is equivalent to the inequality 1/5
432:56 - is greater than x squared, which is greater
than negative 1/5. Notice that I had to flip
432:57 - around the inequality signs when i divided
by negative five. Looking at a graph of y
432:58 - equals x squared, I can see that x squared
is between negative 1/5 and 1/5. For x values
432:59 - corresponding to this section of the graph
that I'm drawing here in green, or this interval
433:00 - of X values on the x axis that I'm drawing
in pink. To find the endpoints of this pink
433:01 - interval, I just need to find where x squared
is exactly equal to 1/5, which is when x is
433:02 - equal to plus or minus the square root of
1/5. So the x values that satisfy me and equality
433:03 - are the x values in between these two values,
I have negative the square root of 1/5 is
433:04 - less than x is less than the square root of
1/5. Now the last step in my history is when
433:05 - I multiplied everything by x, this doesn't
change my interval of convergence, which remains
433:06 - this interval here. In this video, I represented
several functions with power series using
433:07 - the geometric series summation formula. Although
only a limited class of functions can be handled
433:08 - using this formula, some of the techniques
that I used in the process, like multiplying
433:09 - my whole power series by x or plugging in
an expression for x, some of those techniques
433:10 - can be used in a much broader context to represent
many different kinds of functions as power
433:11 - series. As we'll see. Up to now, we've only
been able to calculate the sum of a few various
433:12 - specific series like geometric series and
some telescoping series. In this video, we'll
433:13 - see how to use Taylor series to find the sums
of other series. Let's start by finding the
433:14 - Taylor series for arc tan of x centered at
x equals zero. Since arc tan of x is equal
433:15 - to the integral of one over one plus x squared,
one easy way to find the Taylor series for
433:16 - arc tan of x is to build it up, starting with
the formula for a geometric series, one over
433:17 - one minus x is the sum from n equals zero
to infinity of x to the n. Now, one over one
433:18 - plus x squared is equal to one over one minus
negative x squared. So I can plug negative
433:19 - x squared in for x in this power series. And
I get the sum from n equals zero to infinity
433:20 - of negative x squared to the n, which simplifies
to the sum from n equals zero to infinity,
433:21 - negative one to the n x to the two n. Therefore,
arc tan of x, which is the integral of one
433:22 - over one plus x squared dx is going to be
equal to the integral of this power series,
433:23 - at least up to a constant, I can integrate
this power series term by term to get the
433:24 - sum of negative one to the n, x to the two
n plus one divided by two n plus one plus
433:25 - a constant. To figure out the constant C,
I can plug zero in for x on both sides of
433:26 - my equation. Since all of my powers of x involve
a positive power of x, even when n equals
433:27 - zero, I've got x to the one, so there's always
at least one copy of x there. So if I plug
433:28 - in x equals zero, all of these terms go to
zero, and arc tan of zero is also zero. So
433:29 - plugging in x equals zero gives me zero equals
the sum of a bunch of zeros plus C. In other
433:30 - words, the constant is zero. Therefore, this
expression right here gives me a Taylor series
433:31 - representation of arc tan. Let's take a moment
to figure out which x values this equation
433:32 - is actually true for. We know that the geometric
series formula holds for x values between
433:33 - negative one and one not including the endpoints.
Therefore, when I plug in negative x squared
433:34 - for x, I get In the equation that holds for
negative x squared between one and negative
433:35 - one, which is equivalent to saying that x
is between one and negative one.
433:36 - And when I take the integral of both sides,
I still get an equation that holds true for
433:37 - x between negative one and one. So I'm guaranteed
that this equation up here holds for x values
433:38 - between negative one and one. But in fact,
it's not hard to check that this series actually
433:39 - converges at the endpoints of negative one
and one. This follows from the alternating
433:40 - series test sets when we plug in x equals
negative one, or x equals one. Either way,
433:41 - we get an alternating series that converges.
So this series converges on the closed interval
433:42 - from negative one to one, and it's equal to
arc tan on that open interval. In fact, it
433:43 - turns out that is equal to our tan
433:44 - even on the closed interval. In particular,
the equation holds for x equal to one. When
433:45 - x is equal to one, that I plug into the equation
to get the arc tan of one is equal to the
433:46 - sum from n equals zero to infinity, negative
one to the n times one to the two n plus one,
433:47 - that's just one over two n plus one,
433:48 - I can rewrite that. Now, arc tan of one is
the angle whose tangent is one. So arc tan
433:49 - of one is going to be pi over four. In other
words, I now have a series that sums to pi
433:50 - over four, let's write out the first few terms
of this series and see what it looks like.
433:51 - The first term is one, the next term minus
a third, plus a fifth minus a seventh plus
433:52 - a ninth, and so on. In other words, multiplying
both sides by four, we get that pi is equal
433:53 - to four minus four thirds plus four fifths
minus four sevenths, plus four ninths, minus
433:54 - 4/11, and so on, if you've ever wondered how
to generate digits for pi, here's one way
433:55 - we found the sum of kind of a natural series
to look at. And we found a beautiful formula
433:56 - for pi.
433:57 - For the next example, let's start by finding
the Taylor series for f of x equals ln x centered
433:58 - at x equals one, we can write out the pattern
of the function and its derivatives. And we
433:59 - soon notice that the nth derivative will have
negative one to the n minus one times n minus
434:00 - one factorial times x to the n. Since we're
centering at x equals one, we'll plug in one
434:01 - and get the nth derivative of f at one is
equal to negative one to the n minus one times
434:02 - n minus one factorial. Therefore, the Taylor
series for ln of x will be the sum from n
434:03 - equals zero to infinity of f to the n at one
over n factorial, times x minus one to the
434:04 - n. Since this pattern for the nth derivative
of f really only works, starting with the
434:05 - first derivative, not with the zeroeth derivative,
I'm going to split out the first term, which
434:06 - is just going to be ln of one, which is actually
zero. And then all the other terms follow
434:07 - the same pattern. And we have negative one
to the n minus one, times n minus one factorial
434:08 - divided by the n factorial times x minus one
to the n. This simplifies to ln of x is equal
434:09 - to the sum from n equals one to infinity of
negative one to the n minus one times x minus
434:10 - one to the n over n. Since the n minus one
factorial cancels with almost all the n factorial
434:11 - leaving just the factor and in the denominator,
so I now have a formula for the Taylor series
434:12 - for ln of x. It's easy to check using the
ratio test that this power series has a radius
434:13 - of a convergence of one and so it converges
when x minus one is between one and negative
434:14 - one. It other words when x is between zero,
and two. And although I won't prove it here,
434:15 - it turns out that this Taylor series really
does converge to its function ln of x. And
434:16 - in fact, it converges to ln x on the interval
for x greater than zero and less than or equal
434:17 - to two. Now, if I plug in x equal to two into
my equation, I get something interesting.
434:18 - I get that ln of two is equal to the sum from
n equals one to infinity of negative one to
434:19 - the n minus one of two minus one to the n,
well, that's just one to the n, which is just
434:20 - one. And so I get ln f two is equal to the
sum of negative one to the n minus one over
434:21 - n. That should be looking familiar to you.
And yes,
434:22 - it's true. This is just the alternating harmonic
series, one minus one half, plus 1/3, minus
434:23 - 1/4, and so on. So Taylor series has given
us the sum of the alternating harmonic series,
434:24 - and it is ln of two. In this video, we use
Taylor series to find the sum of the alternating
434:25 - harmonic series.
434:26 - We also used Taylor series for arc tangent,
to find that the sum of a different series
434:27 - is actually equal to pi. As you get more familiar
with Taylor series, you'll be able to
434:28 - calculate the sum of other series by recognizing
them as the series that you get by plugging
434:29 - in a certain value of x into the Taylor series
of a particular function. For example, if
434:30 - you see the series one, plus one over two,
plus one over three factorial, plus one over
434:31 - four factorial, and so on, you might recognize
that as the number one plugged into the formula
434:32 - for the Taylor series of either dx, in other
words, this series is equal to either the
434:33 - one which is e. for any function f of x, whose
derivatives all exist, we can write down the
434:34 - Taylor series for f of x centered at x equals
a, by using this formula. But just because
434:35 - we can write the Taylor series down, doesn't
guarantee that the Taylor series actually
434:36 - converges to the function we started with.
In this video, we'll address the questions
434:37 - of When can we be sure that the Taylor series
converges to its function? And when the Taylor
434:38 - series does converge? How good is the approximation
by taylor polynomials? or partial sums? In
434:39 - other words, how big is the remainder? The
answer to the question, does the Taylor series
434:40 - always converge to the function that's made
from is unfortunately, no. Sometimes the radius
434:41 - of convergence is zero. And sometimes, even
though the radius of convergence is large,
434:42 - or even infinite, the Taylor series converges,
but it converges to the wrong function. Here's
434:43 - an example of the second situation. If we
look at this piecewise defined function, g
434:44 - of x is defined as e to the minus one over
x squared, if x is not zero, and is defined
434:45 - so that it's continuous at zero to be zero,
when x equals zero, it's possible to work
434:46 - out the value of g prime is zero, using the
limit definition of derivative, g prime of
434:47 - zero is the limit as h goes to zero of g of
zero plus h minus g of zero over h, which
434:48 - is the limit as h goes to zero
434:49 - of e to the minus one over h squared minus
zero over h. I'll rewrite this as the limit
434:50 - as h goes to zero of one over h
434:51 - divided by e to the one over h squared. as
h goes to zero from the positive side, this
434:52 - is an infinity over infinity indeterminate
form. And as h goes to zero from the negative
434:53 - side, is a negative infinity over infinity
indeterminate form. In either case, we can
434:54 - use loopy talls rule to replace this limit
with the limit of the derivatives, which simplifies
434:55 - to a zero over infinity kind of limit,
434:56 - which is equal to zero.
434:57 - In a similar way, it's possible to prove that
the second derivative of g zero is also zero,
434:58 - and so is the third derivative, and so are
all the derivatives of G at zero. Therefore,
434:59 - if we write out The Taylor series is just
the sum of a bunch of zeros or the zero function.
435:00 - Certainly this Taylor series converges for
all x, but it converges to the constant zero
435:01 - function. And that's different from the function
that we started with. In fact, the function
435:02 - that we started with g of x is not zero for
any x,
435:03 - except x equals zero. So the Taylor series
only matches the function at the single point
435:04 - x equals zero and nowhere else. We found an
example where the Taylor series converges,
435:05 - but not to its function g of x. Fortunately,
this behavior doesn't happen for most of the
435:06 - functions that we typically deal with. To
understand better, which Taylor series are
435:07 - guaranteed to converge to their functions,
let's take a look at the idea of remainders.
435:08 - For a function f of x as Taylor series T of
x, the remainder is written r sub n of x equals
435:09 - f of x minus T sub n of x, where T sub n of
x is the nth degree Taylor polynomial. This
435:10 - can be expanded out as follows. Previously,
when we looked at remainders for series,
435:11 - we wrote that the remainder was the infinite
sum, which I'll call s infinity, minus the
435:12 - nth partial sum. The analogous expression
for Taylor series might be the entire Taylor
435:13 - series, minus the first terms up through the
degree and term. But that's not what we define
435:14 - the remainder to be for Taylor series. Instead,
the remainder for Taylor series is the difference
435:15 - between the function and the first terms up
to the degree and term. The reason it's defined
435:16 - a little bit differently is because for Taylor
series, we're super interested in the Taylor
435:17 - series converging to its function. And it's
of less interest whether or not the Taylor
435:18 - series happens to converge to its infinite
sum. Because we define the remainder as the
435:19 - difference between the function and its Taylor
polynomial, it follows directly that the Taylor
435:20 - series for f of x converges to f of x and
an interval around a if and only if the limit
435:21 - of the remainders is zero in this interval,
to see this, just note that the limit as n
435:22 - goes to infinity of the Taylor series equals
f of x, that's what it means to converge to
435:23 - f of x. If and only if f of x minus this limit
is equal to zero. We can rewrite this as the
435:24 - limit as n goes to infinity of f of x minus
the limit as n goes to infinity of T n of
435:25 - x equals zero. Since the limit as n goes to
infinity of f of x is just f of x, there's
435:26 - no ends in this expression. Using limit laws,
we can rewrite this again, as the limit of
435:27 - the quantity f of x minus t and f of x equals
zero. But that's just the same thing as saying
435:28 - that the limit of the remainders is zero by
definition of remainders. So we restated the
435:29 - question about when does a Taylor series converge
to its function? As a question about when
435:30 - does the limit of the remainders
435:31 - equals zero?
435:32 - tailors in equality gives us a bound on these
remainders that can help us answer the question
435:33 - of when the remainders limit to zero. This
bound can also be a useful way to answer the
435:34 - question of how close is the approximation
when we use taylor polynomials to approximate
435:35 - a function. Here's some details about when
this bound holds. Suppose there's a number
435:36 - capital N, such that the n plus one derivative
of X has magnitude less than or equal to capital
435:37 - N, for all X's within a distance d of the
center a as a graph, this means that there's
435:38 - a number capital M. And for all X's within
a distance d of the center a, the graph of
435:39 - the n plus one derivative
435:40 - of f
435:41 - lies between negative m and m. So if such
a number M exists, then the remainder r sub
435:42 - n of x of the Taylor series satisfies the
inequality that the magnitude of r sub n of
435:43 - x is less than or equal to this bound capital
M divided by n one plus one factorial times
435:44 - the absolute value of x minus a to the n plus
one to power for all x's in this interval.
435:45 - of length two D that we're talking about.
Now, in the statement of Taylor's inequality,
435:46 - the number m can be chosen just to work for
a particular derivative. But really nice things
435:47 - can happen if we are able to choose the same
number of M to work for all derivatives for
435:48 - our values of little n. In fact, if all derivatives
are bounded by the same value capital M, then
435:49 - we can guarantee that the Taylor series converges
to the function. That gives us a nice practical
435:50 - convergence criterion that I'll show you on
the next slide. The practical convergence
435:51 - condition says that if there's a number capital
M, such that the magnitude of the nth derivative
435:52 - at x is less than capital M, for all numbers,
x and a certain interval around the center.
435:53 - And for all numbers, and then the Taylor series
for f of x converges to f of x 4x is in that
435:54 - interval. I represent the convergence condition
visually. This time, we're agreeing that all
435:55 - the derivatives are within this bound. So
the original function lies within this bound,
435:56 - and its derivative lies within this bound,
and the second derivative lies within this
435:57 - bound. These are not necessarily accurate
representations of the derivatives. But that's
435:58 - the idea. So as long as the bound holds for
all the derivatives, then the Taylor series
435:59 - converges to the function. And it's not too
hard to prove this practical convergence criteria.
436:00 - From Taylor's inequality. Remember that Taylor's
inequality says that, because of this bound,
436:01 - the nth remainder is bounded by M over n plus
one factorial times the absolute value of
436:02 - x minus a to the n plus one. But it's a fact
that the limit as n goes to infinity of M
436:03 - over n plus one factorial, times the absolute
value of x minus a to the n plus one is equal
436:04 - to zero. And it's not hard to prove this fact,
by looking at the series.
436:05 - And using the ratio test, to show that the
series converges, I'll leave that as an exercise
436:06 - for the viewer. Therefore, by the divergence
test, we know that the limit of the terms
436:07 - has to be zero, which is what we want.
436:08 - Now, because the limit of this expression
is zero, by the squeeze theorem, the limit
436:09 - of the our ends has to be zero as well, which
means that the Taylor series converge to the
436:10 - function. This practical convergence criterion
is a very good way to show that Taylor series
436:11 - converges to their function. But even if it
doesn't hold, it's still possible that the
436:12 - Taylor series may converge to its function,
or in some cases, it may not. Let's use this
436:13 - practical convergence condition to prove the
Taylor series for sine x converges to sine
436:14 - x. Recall the Taylor series for sine x is
given by this equation. And recall also that
436:15 - any nth derivative of x for f of x equals
sine x will have to be of the form sine x,
436:16 - or negative sine x, or cosine of x, or negative
cosine of x. That's simply because when we
436:17 - take repeated derivatives of sine and cosine,
the values cycle around in between those four
436:18 - possible answers. Now, since the absolute
value of sine x is always less than one, or
436:19 - equal to one and same thing for cosine, we
know that the nth derivative of our function
436:20 - has to be bounded by one, so we'll let m be
one. And this bound holds for all x values,
436:21 - all real numbers. Therefore, we know that
the Taylor series converges to the function
436:22 - sine of x. for all values of x. We've used
the practical convergence condition with M
436:23 - equals one to prove this. In this video, we
defined the nth remainder for a Taylor series
436:24 - as a difference between the function and its
nth Taylor polynomial. We also gave a bound
436:25 - on the size of the nth remainder. It's always
less than or equal to M over n plus one factorial
436:26 - times the value of x minus a to the n plus
one where M is a bound on the size of the
436:27 - n plus ones. derivative of x for x within
some distance d of a. Because of this formula
436:28 - for the remainder known as Taylor's inequality,
we can show that
436:29 - if the
436:30 - nth derivative of x is always bounded by the
same M for all x within a certain interval
436:31 - around a, and for all values of n, then the
Taylor series converge to its function. This
436:32 - video introduces the idea of parametric equations,
instead of describing a curve as y equals
436:33 - f of x, we can describe the x coordinates
and y coordinates separately in terms of a
436:34 - third variable t, usually thought of as time.
so we can write x as a function of t and y
436:35 - as a separate function of t. This is especially
useful as a way to describe curves that don't
436:36 - satisfy the vertical line test, and therefore
can't be described traditionally as functions
436:37 - of y in terms of x. A Cartesian equation for
a curve is an equation in terms of x and y
436:38 - only. parametric equations for a curve give
both x and y as functions of a third variable,
436:39 - usually T. The third variable is called the
parameter. That's our first example, let's
436:40 - graph the parametric equations given here
on an x y coordinate axis. We'll do this by
436:41 - finding x and y coordinates that correspond
to the same value of t. For example, when
436:42 - t is negative two, you can calculate that
x, I plug in negative two for t gives you
436:43 - five and y, when you plug in negative two
for t gives you eight. Please pause the video
436:44 - for a moment and fill in some additional values
of x and y. For some additional values of
436:45 - t. Your chart should look like this. And when
we plot the XY pairs and connect the dots,
436:46 - we get something like this. It says this point
over here corresponds to a T value of negative
436:47 - two. And this point over here corresponds
to the t value of two. So if we think of t
436:48 - as time, we're traversing the curve in this
direction, to find a Cartesian equation for
436:49 - this curve, we need to eliminate the variable
t from these equations. One way to do this
436:50 - is to solve for t and one equation, say the
first equation. So two t is equal to one minus
436:51 - x, which means that t is one half minus x
over two, then we can plug that expression
436:52 - for t into the second equation and get y equals
one half minus x over two squared plus four,
436:53 - which simplifies to the quadratic equation,
y equals 1/4 X squared minus one half x plus
436:54 - 17 fourths. Let's try some more examples.
A table of values for the first example helps
436:55 - us draw the familiar graph of a circle of
radius one. This should come as no surprise,
436:56 - since the equations x equals cosine t and
y equals sine t, are familiar from trig as
436:57 - a way of describing the x and y coordinates
of a point on the unit circle. Notice that
436:58 - when t equals zero, our curve lies on the
positive x axis. And as t increases from zero
436:59 - to two pi, we traverse the curve once in the
counterclockwise direction. A Cartesian equation
437:00 - for this unit circle is given by the equation
x squared plus y squared equals one. This
437:01 - follows from the trig identity cosine squared
t plus sine squared t equals one by substituting
437:02 - in X for cosine t, and y for sine t. Please
pause the video for a moment to graph the
437:03 - second curve and rewrite it as a Cartesian
equation. The table of values should help
437:04 - you see that the graph is again a unit circle.
But this time, as t increases from zero
437:05 - to two pi, we actually traverse the circle
twice in the clockwise direction. I'll draw
437:06 - this with a double arrow going clockwise The
Cartesian equation for this graph is still
437:07 - x squared plus y squared equals one. And so
we found two different parameterizations.
437:08 - For the same
437:09 - graph on the x, y axis. Let's take a look
at the third equation. There's no interval
437:10 - value specified for t here. So let's just
assume that t can be any real number.
437:11 - Now as T ranges from negative infinity to
infinity, our Y values, which are given by
437:12 - cosine t, oscillate between one and negative
one, our x values are always the square of
437:13 - our Y values. So the graph of this curve has
to lie on the graph of x equals y squared,
437:14 - which is a sideways parabola. But a parametrically
defined curve doesn't cover this whole parabola.
437:15 - Remember that y is given by cosine of t. So
y can only range between negative one and
437:16 - one. And so we're only getting the portion
of the parabola that I shade in here. As t
437:17 - varies from say, zero to pi, I traverse this
parabola one time. And then as t goes from
437:18 - pi to two pi, I go back again in the other
direction. And as T continues to increase,
437:19 - I traverse this parabola infinitely many times.
The Cartesian equation for this curve is the
437:20 - equation x equals y squared, with the restriction
that y is between negative one and one. We've
437:21 - seen several examples where we went from parametric
equations to Cartesian equations. Now let's
437:22 - start with a Cartesian equation and rewrite
it as a parametric equation. In this example,
437:23 - y is already given as a function of x. So
an easy way to parameterize. This curve is
437:24 - to just let x equal t. And then y is equal
to the square root of t squared minus t, substituting
437:25 - in T for x, the domain restriction in terms
of x just translates into a restriction in
437:26 - terms of t. I call this the copycat parameterization.
Since we have successfully introduced the
437:27 - new variable t, but T just copies, whatever
x does. In the second example, we could try
437:28 - setting x equal to t, then we get 25 t squared
plus 36, y squared is equal to 900. and solving
437:29 - for y, we'd have y squared equals 900 minus
25 t squared over 36. So y is plus or minus
437:30 - the square root of this quantity. This is
a very awkward looking expression. And fact,
437:31 - why is that even a function of t here because
of the plus and minus signs. So let's look
437:32 - for a better way to parameterize this curve.
Because of the x squared and the y squared,
437:33 - this equation is a good candidate for parameterizing
using sine and cosine. In fact, if we divide
437:34 - both sides of the equation by 900, we get
25x squared over 900 plus 36, y squared over
437:35 - 900 is equal to one, which simplifies to x
squared over 36 plus y squared over 25 is
437:36 - equal to one. If I rewrite this as x over
six squared plus Y over five squared equals
437:37 - one, then I can set x over six equal to cosine
of t, and y over five equal to sine of t.
437:38 - And I can see that for any value of t x over
six and y over five will satisfy this equation
437:39 - simply because cosine squared plus sine squared
equals one. This gives me the parameterization
437:40 - x equals six cosine of t, y equals five sine
of t, which is a handy way to describe an
437:41 - ellipse. As a final example, let's describe
a general circle of radius r, and center HK.
437:42 - For any point, x, y on the circle, we know
that the distance from that point x y to the
437:43 - center of the circle is equal to r. So using
the distance formula, we know that the square
437:44 - root of x minus h squared plus y minus k squared
has to equal Are squaring both sides. This
437:45 - gives us the equation for the circle in Cartesian
coordinates. So for example, if our circle
437:46 - has radius five, and has Center at the point
negative 317, then its equation would be x
437:47 - minus negative three, that's x plus three
squared plus y minus 17 squared is equal to
437:48 - 25. One way to find the equation of a general
circle in parametric equations, is to start
437:49 - with the unit circle and work our way up.
We know that the unit circle with radius one
437:50 - centered at the origin is given by the equation
x equals cosine t, and y equals sine t. If
437:51 - we want a circle of radius r centered around
the origin instead, then we need to expand
437:52 - everything by a factor of R. So we multiply
our x and y coordinates by R. If we now want
437:53 - the center to be at HK instead of at the origin,
then we need to add h to our x coordinates
437:54 - and add K to all our Y coordinates. This gives
us the general equation for a circle in parametric
437:55 - equations. to match the Cartesian equation
above,
437:56 - we can write
437:57 - our same example circle and parametric equations
as x equals five cosine t minus three, y equals
437:58 - five sine t plus 17. In this video, we translated
back and forth in between
437:59 - Cartesian equations and parametric equations
with a special emphasis on the equations for
438:00 - circles. This video is about finding the slopes
of tangent lines,
438:01 - for curves to find parametrically. To find
the slope of the tangent line, for a curve
438:02 - y equals p of x, given an ordinary Cartesian
coordinates,
438:03 - we just take dydx or equivalently, we calculate
p prime of x. If the curve is defined parametrically
438:04 - by the equations, x equals f of t, y equals
g of t. To find the slope of the tangent line,
438:05 - we still want to find dydx. But since our
curve is given parametrically, we don't have
438:06 - ready access to the y dx. Instead, we'll need
to calculate it from the Y DT and dx dt, which
438:07 - are easy to get from our parametric equations.
to relate dydx to d y DT and dx dt, we just
438:08 - need to use the chain rule. Recall that the
chain rule says that d y dt is equal to d
438:09 - y dx times dx dt. So rearranging, we know
that dou y dx is equal to d y DT divided by
438:10 - dx dt. And that's how we'll calculate the
slope of our tangent line, we can write this
438:11 - formula equivalently as d y dx is equal to
g prime of t over f prime of t. Now let's
438:12 - use these formulas in an example. For the
list as you figure given by these equations,
438:13 - and drawn below, let's find the slopes of
the tangent lines at the center point with
438:14 - x&y coordinates of zero. And let's find the
way the tangent line is horizontal. The slope
438:15 - of the tangent line is given by dy dx, which
is d y DT divided by dx dt. Now d y dt is
438:16 - going to be cosine of two t times two and
dx dt is going to be negative sine of t. Taking
438:17 - the ratio, we see that dydx is twice cosine
of two t over negative sine of t. Now we want
438:18 - to calculate this slope not when t is zero,
but when x and y are 0x
438:19 - is
438:20 - 01. cosine of t is zero, which is when t is
pi over two and three pi over two. Those are
438:21 - the only two values that work in the interval
of t values that we're interested in. And
438:22 - it's easy to check that when T has these values,
then y, which is sine of two t, is also going
438:23 - to be zero. So we want to calculate d y DT
at t equals pi over two, and at t equals three
438:24 - pi over two. plugging into our formula for
dydx, we get twice cosine of pi divided by
438:25 - negative sine of pi over two, which simplifies
to positive two. And when t is three pi over
438:26 - two, we get twice cosine of three Pi over
negative sine three pi over two, which simplifies
438:27 - to negative two. So our tangent lines at the
origin have slopes positive two, and negative
438:28 - two. Next, let's find where the tangent line
is horizontal. From the figure, there should
438:29 - be four places. If we set d y dx equals zero,
we get that two cosine of two t over negative
438:30 - sine of t needs to be zero, which means that
we need cosine of two t t equals zero, or
438:31 - two t, two equal pi over two, plus some multiple
of pi. Solving for T, we get that T has to
438:32 - equal pi over four, plus some multiple of
pi over two. There are indeed four such values
438:33 - of t in the interval from zero to two pi.
And those are pi over four, three Pi over
438:34 - four, five pi over four, and seven pi over
four, we can find the x and y coordinates
438:35 - of these points simply by plugging in these
values of t into our original equations. Here
438:36 - are the XY coordinates of those four points.
In this video, we saw that for a curve given
438:37 - by parametric equations, the slope of the
tangent line is given by D y dX, which is
438:38 - d y d t, divided by dx dt. In this video,
we'll find the area under a curve defined
438:39 - parametrically. Recall that the area under
a curve y equals p of x defined in usual Cartesian
438:40 - coordinates is just the integral from x equals
a to x equals b of y dx. Or, in other words,
438:41 - the integral from a to b of p of x dx. If
instead, the curve is given by the parametric
438:42 - equations, x equals f of t and y equals g
of t, the area is still going to be the integral
438:43 - of y dx. But now y can be written as g of
t, and dx is going to be f prime of t dt using
438:44 - differential notation.
438:45 - Therefore, the area is going to be the integral
of g of t, f prime of t, dt. And since we're
438:46 - integrating with respect to t, now, our bounds
of integration
438:47 - have to also be t values, I'll still call
them a and b, but I want them to represent
438:48 - t values here. It's important to note that
this is still the area under a curve. In other
438:49 - words, in between the curve and the x axis.
Let's use this formula to find the area enclosed
438:50 - by this list as you figure given by these
equations. by symmetry, it's enough to compute
438:51 - the area under one segment of the lisu curve,
and then multiply that area, which I'll call
438:52 - a bye for now, a is equal to the integral
of y dx. And using our parametric equations,
438:53 - we know that y is sine of two t, and dx is
the derivative of cosine. So that's negative
438:54 - sine of t dt. the rightmost point of the section
of curve that we're interested in Then right
438:55 - here happens when x is one and y equals zero,
it's easy to check that that occurs when t
438:56 - equals zero. The leftmost point of the section
of curve occurs when x and y are both zero,
438:57 - setting both our equations equal to zero and
solving for T, we see this happens when t
438:58 - is pi over two,
438:59 - plus any multiple of pi. So the first time
we reach this point, after the t value of
439:00 - zero is when t is simply pi over
439:01 - two.
439:02 - So we'll set our bounds of integration as
from t equals zero to t equals pi over two.
439:03 - plugging this information into our equation,
we get that the area is the integral from
439:04 - zero to pi over two of sine of two t times
negative sine of t dt. Let's pull the negative
439:05 - sign out and use the double angle formula
to rewrite sine of two t as two sine t cosine
439:06 - t, multiply that by the sine t dt,
439:07 - we can pull the two out and rewrite this as
sine squared of t cosine t dt. And then I
439:08 - use substitution will allow us to compute
the integral
439:09 - we get negative two times the integral from
u equals zero to one of u squared d u, which
439:10 - integrates to negative two u cubed over three,
evaluate between one and zero, which is negative
439:11 - two thirds. Notice I get a negative answer
here. And that's because I accidentally integrated
439:12 - from right and point to the left endpoint
instead of from the left to the right, I accidentally
439:13 - followed the t values in increasing order
when I should have integrated in the other
439:14 - order in order to make the x values in increasing
order. In any case, I can correct this by
439:15 - switching my bounds of integration, or more
quickly just by sticking a negative sign in
439:16 - front and changing my sign. Now I can figure
out the total area inside the list of geo
439:17 - figure just by multiplying by four. In this
video, we saw that the area underneath the
439:18 - curve given in parametric equations, is given
by the integral of y dx, which if x is f of
439:19 - t and y is g of t, this is just the integral
of g of t times f prime of t dt, our bounds
439:20 - of integration need to be t values.
439:21 - In this video, we'll calculate the length
of curves given by parametric equations. As
439:22 - a warm up, let's calculate the length of this
curve graph below. Since it's piecewise, linear,
439:23 - we can just calculate the length of each linear
piece using the distance formula.
439:24 - For example, the length of the first segment
is given by the square root of y two minus
439:25 - y one squared, that's three minus two squared
plus x two minus x one squared, that's two
439:26 - minus one squared, which gives us the square
root of two. Similarly, the second piece has
439:27 - length given by the square root of five minus
three squared plus three minus two squared,
439:28 - which is the square root of five, we can make
similar calculations for the length of the
439:29 - third segment and the fourth segment. adding
these together, we get a total length of twice
439:30 - the square root of five plus the square root
of two plus two. We can use the same process
439:31 - to approximate the length of any curve by
dividing it up into and small pieces, approximating
439:32 - each piece with a straight line and using
the distance formula to find the length of
439:33 - the line segments. If the curve is given by
the parametric equations, x equals f of t
439:34 - and y equals g of t. Then we can write each
of these points along the line in terms of
439:35 - f and g. For example, P of i minus one, we
can write as the x coordinate F. Have t minus
439:36 - one and the y coordinate g of t minus one.
And similarly, p II is going to be x coordinate
439:37 - f of t AI, y coordinate g of t AI. If we think
of t as time, then this is just saying that
439:38 - T sub i is the time at which we get to point
a piece of AI. Now, the distance formula tells
439:39 - us that the length of the line segment from
P sub i minus one to P sub i is going to be
439:40 - given by the square root of x two minus x
one squared. That's f of t sub i minus f of
439:41 - t sub i minus one squared plus y two minus
y one, that's g of t sub i minus g of t sub
439:42 - i minus one
439:43 - squared.
439:44 - Now, the total length of the curve, which
is called the arc length, is going to be approximately
439:45 - equal to the sum of the length of these segments.
This is starting to look a bit like a Riemann
439:46 - sum, but it's missing the delta t. So I'll
fix that by multiplying the numerator and
439:47 - the denominator by delta t. If I suck the
delta t from the denominator, inside the square
439:48 - root sign, it needs to become a delta t squared,
and I get the following expression. If I break
439:49 - up my fractions, I can rewrite this. Now there's
something kind of exciting going on this quotient
439:50 - here looks a lot like a slope. In fact, it's
exactly the expression for the slope of the
439:51 - secant line for the function f that we get
if we were calculating the derivative of f
439:52 - with respect to t. And similarly, this expression,
and here is exactly the expression for the
439:53 - slope of the secant line, we'd get if we were
calculating the derivative of g with respect
439:54 - to t. Because these quotients here, are approximately
equal to f prime and g prime, or more rigorously,
439:55 - because of the mean value theorem, I can replace
my expression with f prime of t i star squared,
439:56 - and g prime of t star squared, where ti star
is some time in the if time interval. Now
439:57 - exact arc length is going to be the limit
of this expression, as the number of intervals
439:58 - goes to infinity. As usual, I can replace
the limit of this Riemann sum with an integral
439:59 - where the bounds of integration are the t
values that get me from the start of the curve
440:00 - to the end of the curve. This arc length formula
has an alternative form, which is the integral
440:01 - from a to b of the square root of dx dt squared
plus d y dt squared, dt. And these are my
440:02 - two versions of this very useful
440:03 - formula for arc length. Now let's use this
formula to set up an integral to express the
440:04 - arc length of this list as you figure
440:05 - since dx dt is given by negative sine of t.
And the Y dt is given by two cosine of two
440:06 - t, our Clank is given by the integral of the
square root of sine of t squared plus two
440:07 - cosine of two t squared dt, we do still need
to figure out the bounds of integration in
440:08 - terms of t. That will make us wrap around
this curve exactly one time. It's easy to
440:09 - check that when t equals 0x is equal to one
and y is equal to zero. So we're at this point
440:10 - right here.
440:11 - The next time that we get to this point, with
an x coordinate of one, we need x equal cosine
440:12 - t to equal one. So the next time will be when
t equals two pi.
440:13 - Therefore, our bounds of integration are going
to be from zero to two pi. It's easy to set
440:14 - up This integral, but it would be very difficult
to actually integrate it. And that's often
440:15 - the case with our clients. But we could use
a calculator or a computer to get a numerical
440:16 - approximation of about 9.4. In this video,
we derive an equation for arc length. This
440:17 - video introduces the idea of polar coordinates.
Polar Coordinates give an alternative way
440:18 - of describing the location of points on the
plane. Instead of describing a point, in terms
440:19 - of its x and y coordinates, those are the
Cartesian coordinates of the point. When using
440:20 - polar coordinates, we instead describe the
point in terms of radius r, and an angle theta,
440:21 - r is the distance of the point from the origin,
and theta is the angle that radius line makes
440:22 - with the positive x axis. Let's plot these
points given in polar coordinates. So the
440:23 - eight here is the value of the radius, and
the negative two thirds pi is the value of
440:24 - the angle theta. The negative angle means
that I need to go clockwise from the positive
440:25 - x axis, instead of counterclockwise like I
normally would for a positive angle. So here,
440:26 - a negative two thirds pi means that I need
to go to this line right here. And the eight
440:27 - of for the radius means I need to go eight
lines out from the origin. So my point should
440:28 - be around right here. The next point has a
radius of five and an angle of three pi. The
440:29 - angle of positive three pi means that I go
counterclockwise starting at the positive
440:30 - x axis, here, I've gone around by two pi.
And here, I've got an extra pi to make three
440:31 - pi. Now the radius of five means I need to
go five units out from the origin. So that
440:32 - puts me about right here. Notice that I could
have also labeled this point with the polar
440:33 - coordinates
440:34 - of five Pi, there's more than one way to assign
polar coordinates to a point.
440:35 - The next point has an angle of pi over four,
and a radius of negative 12. The negative
440:36 - radius means that I need to jump to the other
side of the circle before I plot the point.
440:37 - In other words, instead of plotting the point
at an angle of pi over four and a radius of
440:38 - 12, which would be about right here, I go
to the opposite side of the circle, and plotted
440:39 - at the same distance from the origin, but
180 degrees or pi radians around the circle
440:40 - over here. Now I could have also labeled this
point using a positive radius of 12. And using
440:41 - an angle of pi over four plus pi, or five
pi over four. And in general, a point with
440:42 - polar coordinates of negative r theta means
the same point as the point with polar coordinates
440:43 - r, theta plus pi. Adding pi just makes us
jump around to the opposite side of the circle.
440:44 - To convert between polar and Cartesian coordinates,
it's handy to use the following equations.
440:45 - First, x is equal to r cosine theta, y is
equal to r sine theta r squared is equal to
440:46 - x squared plus y squared, which means that
R is plus or minus the square root of x squared
440:47 - plus y squared. And tangent theta is equal
to y divided by x. Let's see where these equations
440:48 - come from. If we draw a point with coordinates,
x, y, and draw lines to make a right triangle,
440:49 - the height of that triangle is y. The length
of the base is x. And the high partners has
440:50 - length R. Theta is the measure of this interior
angle. From trig, we know that cosine theta
440:51 - is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse, so that's
x over r, which means that x is equal to r
440:52 - cosine theta. Similarly, sine theta is opposite
over hypotenuse. That's why over R, which
440:53 - means that y is equal to r sine theta. That
gives us the first two equations the batang
440:54 - orien theorem tells us that x squared plus
y squared is equal to r squared. And that
440:55 - gives us the third equation. Finally, tangent
theta is opposite over adjacent. So that's
440:56 - y over x, which is the fourth equation.
440:57 - To convert five, negative pi over six, from
polar to Cartesian coordinates, we just use
440:58 - the fact that x equals r cosine theta, and
y equals r sine theta. So in this case, x
440:59 - is equal to five times cosine of negative
pi over six, that's five times square root
441:00 - of three over two, and y is equal to five,
sine negative pi over six. So that's equal
441:01 - to negative five halves, did convert negative
one negative one from Cartesian to polar coordinates,
441:02 - we know that negative one and negative one
are x and y values. So we need to use the
441:03 - fact that r squared is x squared plus y squared,
that is r squared is negative one squared
441:04 - plus negative one squared, or two. Also, tangent
theta is y over x, so that's negative one
441:05 - over negative one, or one. Now there's several
values of r and theta that satisfy these equations
441:06 - are could be squared of two, or negative the
square root of two, and theta could be Pi
441:07 - over four, or five pi over four. Or we could
add multiples of two pi to either of these
441:08 - answers. But not all combinations of r and
theta, get us to the right point. The point
441:09 - with Cartesian coordinates negative one negative
one lies in the third quadrant. But if we
441:10 - use a theta value of say pi over four and
an R value of square root of two, that would
441:11 - get us to the first quadrant. So instead,
we need to use the polar coordinates
441:12 - of square root of two
441:13 - and five pi over four. Or if we prefer, negative
square root of two, and pi over four. We could
441:14 - also add any multiple of two pi to either
of these values of theta, and get yet another
441:15 - way of representing the point and polar coordinates.
This video talked about polar coordinates
441:16 - and converting in between Cartesian coordinates
and polar coordinates using some familiar
441:17 - equations from trig.
