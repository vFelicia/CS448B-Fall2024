00:00 - okay so welcome everyone the quantum
00:03 - computers are coming
00:06 - my name is aleister collinson i'm a
00:08 - senior software developer for xenocode
00:09 - technology and blah blah blah you don't
00:11 - really care about any of that do you
00:14 - there's one thing really that you have
00:15 - to know about me
00:17 - i'm a nerd
00:18 - i'm a huge nerd in fact i'm so much of a
00:20 - nerd that my colleagues call me a nerd
00:23 - and they are you know other computer
00:24 - scientists
00:26 - and mathematicians and physicists now
00:29 - personally i'm not a physicist not at
00:31 - all last time i had any formal education
00:34 - in physics is
00:37 - ages ago
00:39 - but
00:40 - i'm here nevertheless to speak about
00:43 - quantum computers
00:45 - and
00:46 - the good news is you don't have to be a
00:49 - physicist anymore
00:50 - to get into quantum computing it's the
00:53 - time now where being a nerd is
00:56 - sufficient and that's really good news
00:58 - because in looking at you here
01:01 - you're probably not going to need
01:03 - quantum computers for your job yet
01:05 - you're sitting here watching a talk on
01:07 - quantum computers chances are you two
01:09 - are
01:10 - nerds okay so
01:13 - what is a quantum computer let's get
01:15 - started with the
01:16 - the basic term
01:18 - and
01:19 - the easier part of that is what is a
01:20 - computer well
01:22 - this is a computer rather older than
01:24 - what you probably use i hope
01:26 - this
01:27 - one could argue
01:28 - is the first computer ever at least the
01:31 - first
01:32 - uh electronic
01:34 - digital programmable computer the twoso
01:37 - z3
01:38 - and
01:40 - digital
01:41 - or binary is a big point there
01:45 - when we think of binary we normally
01:47 - think of zeros and ones but that's not
01:50 - really true is it
01:52 - we don't have zeros and ones in our
01:54 - computers
01:55 - we have
01:56 - two distinct states and
01:59 - for what we care about it could be a
02:00 - green circle and a red triangle as long
02:03 - as they are distinct
02:05 - that's fine
02:07 - now computers nowadays work with
02:09 - transistors well smaller than those
02:12 - more like this here
02:14 - built into small chips
02:16 - and the way that transistors work is
02:19 - basically that depending on their input
02:21 - they either let a current go through or
02:23 - they don't two distinct states wonderful
02:27 - and this is great for loads and loads of
02:29 - problems
02:31 - i mean the
02:32 - fact that we are
02:34 - where we are with computing technology
02:36 - nowadays is due to the fact that this is
02:38 - such a versatile
02:40 - um
02:42 - a versatile tool
02:44 - but it's not great for everything
02:46 - [Music]
02:47 - and
02:48 - i'm going to show an example of
02:50 - something it's not great at
02:52 - as nerds you may be not that familiar
02:54 - with this but
02:56 - nature
02:58 - okay so nature is not
03:01 - binary
03:02 - let's have a look at a close part of
03:04 - that and try to
03:05 - try to determine where we have forest so
03:08 - this part that's clearly forest
03:11 - this part clearly isn't forest
03:14 - but
03:15 - what about that part i mean you clearly
03:17 - have some trees there right
03:19 - but most of it is grass
03:22 - so
03:22 - where do we draw the line when do we
03:24 - call it a forest
03:26 - and that question where do we draw the
03:29 - line we have to draw an arbitrary line
03:32 - we have to decide
03:34 - how much say trees per square kilometer
03:37 - or whatever counts as a forest
03:40 - and
03:42 - when we have to draw such a line
03:45 - when we have to make a decision we are
03:46 - artificially making our world binary
03:52 - binary problems
03:53 - are great for computers non-binary
03:56 - problems not so much
03:59 - okay so that's the computer part
04:02 - i think we're all up to speed
04:04 - now the quantum part
04:06 - so quantum as you may have guessed is
04:08 - based on quantum mechanics quantum
04:10 - mechanics was first introduced by
04:14 - niels bohr and
04:17 - carl ivana karl heisenberg
04:19 - they worked together
04:21 - in the 1920s came up with
04:24 - quantum mechanics and what they called
04:26 - the
04:28 - the copenhagen interpretation of quantum
04:30 - mechanics named after the city where
04:32 - they worked together
04:34 - now i'm not going to explain all of
04:37 - quantum mechanics partly because as i
04:38 - said i'm not a physicist
04:40 - and partly because even if i were we
04:43 - would need more than the time we have
04:46 - available so i'll give you an example
04:48 - and the example is imagine we have an
04:50 - atom
04:51 - in fact we don't care about the whole
04:53 - atom all we care about is the nucleus
04:54 - here and let's say that our atom is
04:57 - radioactive what does radioactivity mean
05:00 - it means basically that at some point
05:03 - it will decay which means that part of
05:06 - it
05:07 - will radiate away
05:09 - this radioactive particle and alpha
05:11 - particle in this case will leave the
05:13 - nucleus
05:14 - and what remains will be
05:17 - some other
05:18 - element
05:20 - so
05:21 - assuming we have our particle
05:25 - our
05:26 - atom
05:27 - and we wait for a certain time
05:30 - if we look at that particle there are
05:32 - two states we could imagine it being in
05:34 - either it hasn't changed at all
05:36 - or it has decayed right
05:39 - according to the copenhagen
05:41 - interpretation
05:43 - of quantum mechanics it can be both at
05:46 - the same time
05:48 - that is
05:49 - it can be both at the same time until we
05:52 - actually measure it
05:54 - now don't be you know confused by those
05:56 - eyes i'm not stating that there's any
05:59 - connection between consciousness and
06:01 - physics
06:02 - looking is one way of measuring it but
06:04 - anything that relies on its being in one
06:07 - state or the other counts
06:10 - so
06:11 - nevertheless this is a really really
06:14 - weird thing to imagine how can something
06:16 - be in two states at the same time
06:18 - and so schrodinger here in 1935 he
06:23 - thought there was this was pretty weird
06:25 - so he came up with a thought experiment
06:28 - showing how
06:29 - absolutely weird
06:31 - the um the interpretation was
06:34 - that heisenberg and boar had come up
06:36 - with
06:38 - in this experiment which you may have
06:40 - heard of
06:41 - he has a cat and this cat is totally
06:44 - fine it's healthy it's not likely to die
06:48 - within the next hour or so of natural
06:50 - causes
06:51 - and he puts this cat into a box
06:55 - the cat however is not the only thing in
06:57 - the box
06:58 - what else do we have well we have a
07:00 - radioactive
07:02 - source of some kind
07:04 - this is very similar to the radioactive
07:06 - atom we had previously there's just more
07:08 - of them
07:09 - and
07:11 - this source has been chosen in a
07:13 - particular way so that if one hour
07:15 - passes
07:17 - the chance that any of it has decayed is
07:20 - 50 50.
07:22 - okay
07:24 - what else do we have well there's also a
07:26 - flask filled with cyanide gas in there
07:29 - cyanide gas of course highly poisonous
07:32 - it's better if the gas stays in that
07:34 - flask
07:35 - but
07:37 - he added
07:38 - a fourth
07:40 - thing
07:41 - he added
07:42 - a construction which consists of a
07:44 - geiger counter
07:46 - that if it measures any radioactivity
07:49 - we'll
07:50 - use that hammer
07:52 - and what will happen there well
07:59 - dead cat
08:02 - so
08:04 - if we again imagine
08:06 - an hour passes what are the states that
08:09 - we could have well i thought the
08:12 - radioactive isotope has not
08:14 - done anything it's not decayed in any
08:16 - way
08:18 - and the case is fine
08:20 - or
08:21 - well the cat's dead
08:24 - two possible states and according to the
08:27 - copenhagen interpretation we could have
08:29 - both of them
08:30 - together we could have them at the same
08:32 - time
08:34 - i mean how can a cat be dead and alive
08:36 - at the same time right
08:42 - schrodinger wasn't thinking of zombie
08:45 - cats as far as i can tell but
08:47 - it's definitely a weird concept
08:50 - and so
08:52 - he came up with an alternative
08:54 - interpretation because he did believe
08:56 - that the maths behind quantum mechanics
08:59 - was correct he just thought that the
09:01 - copenhagen interpretation was nonsense
09:04 - and the interpretation he came up with
09:07 - is called the many worlds interpretation
09:11 - now
09:12 - before i get into what the mini world
09:14 - interpretation means i have a small
09:17 - disclaimer
09:18 - for us for our purposes the many world
09:21 - interpretation is a model
09:23 - it helps us understand certain aspects
09:26 - of the topic
09:28 - it's really good at that if it's chosen
09:30 - well
09:31 - but models have something else often
09:34 - models are wrong in many ways
09:38 - and that's fine as long as they're wrong
09:41 - in ways that we don't care about
09:44 - and
09:46 - the many world's interpretation for our
09:48 - purposes is
09:50 - right in where it counts it may or may
09:53 - not be correct in all
09:55 - of all
09:56 - i don't know i'm not a physicist and i
09:58 - think even physicists are unsure about
10:00 - this
10:01 - it's certainly right in the ways we care
10:03 - about
10:05 - okay with that disclaimer out of the way
10:08 - what does the mini world's
10:09 - interpretation say well it says first of
10:12 - all take everything there is the world
10:15 - the galaxy the universe i couldn't find
10:18 - a picture of the universe but the galaxy
10:19 - here will work
10:21 - and in this universe among other things
10:24 - you have
10:26 - your cat
10:27 - now
10:28 - when this radioactive event happens this
10:31 - quantum event so to speak
10:35 - you don't get your zombie cat situation
10:38 - rather what happens is
10:40 - that you get two universes
10:43 - and basically that carbon copies of each
10:45 - other with one exception and that
10:48 - exception is the result of your quantum
10:50 - event and everything that followed from
10:52 - that so in one universe you have a live
10:55 - cat
10:56 - in one universe you have a dead cat
10:58 - and of course this can happen again
11:02 - if you have another radioactive event
11:04 - quantum event
11:06 - giving you four universes and
11:10 - again giving you eight universes
11:12 - you get the picture
11:14 - now
11:15 - one thing you may notice on this slide
11:18 - is we have rather many dead cats
11:21 - and uh
11:23 - well that's
11:24 - not that pleasant
11:26 - thing is we have this situation because
11:30 - of biology
11:32 - in our universe at least and probably in
11:35 - all other relevant universes if you have
11:37 - a dead cat and add more cyanide you
11:39 - don't get a live cat
11:42 - that's not how biology works or
11:45 - chemistry or anything luckily for us
11:48 - cats and quantum computers are different
11:50 - in that aspect
11:52 - so
11:54 - now we're getting to the actual meat of
11:56 - the matter
11:58 - what we see here is called a blossom and
12:01 - it's a represent a representation of a
12:05 - qubit a quantum bit
12:07 - that's the
12:08 - equivalent of your zeros and ones your
12:11 - bits
12:12 - or your
12:13 - there is a current and there's no
12:15 - current
12:16 - your green circle and your red triangle
12:20 - this is the equivalent in the quantum
12:22 - computing world so
12:24 - what states can we have in there well
12:26 - first of all you can have a zero state
12:28 - which is represented by
12:30 - your vector pointing
12:32 - to the top there
12:34 - you can have a one state which is
12:36 - represented by pointing to the bottom
12:39 - so that's simple enough but you can also
12:42 - have something that looks like this
12:45 - now this isn't zero and it isn't one
12:48 - it's not really between the two either
12:51 - at least not in this visualization
12:54 - it's somewhere on the sphere
12:57 - and
12:58 - mathematically speaking this is actually
13:00 - a combination of the two base values
13:02 - we're using now if that math confuses
13:05 - you because i mean zero's at the bottom
13:08 - at the top one's at the bottom how can
13:10 - some of that be somewhere else
13:12 - ignore the math we don't need it for the
13:14 - rest of the talk
13:16 - it is a combination
13:18 - it makes sense in the mathematical model
13:21 - the blossphere is a three-dimensional
13:23 - representation of four-dimensional space
13:27 - it gets
13:28 - mathematical
13:30 - um we don't have to care about it
13:32 - what we have to care about is okay
13:35 - assuming we have this
13:37 - qubit
13:38 - what can we do with it
13:40 - and uh if you want to do something with
13:42 - a qubit you need a quantum gate so let's
13:45 - go through a few quantum gates first one
13:48 - i want to show you is the so-called
13:50 - hadamard gate
13:52 - so the hadamard gate operates on a
13:54 - single qubit
13:56 - and basically it imagines that there's a
13:59 - further axis between the x and the z
14:02 - axis
14:03 - and it then spins our vector around that
14:05 - axis
14:07 - now
14:08 - if you are measuring a qubit
14:12 - if it's at the zero position it will
14:14 - give you zero all of the time
14:17 - binary value if it's a one it will give
14:20 - you one all of the time
14:22 - if it's somewhere in between
14:24 - it will give you zero and one with
14:26 - certain probabilities
14:28 - so if we were to measure measure
14:30 - it's at this point
14:32 - in an ideal quantum computer at least
14:34 - you would get
14:35 - zero and one each with fifty percent
14:38 - uh probability
14:42 - this state where you can have
14:45 - zero or one as a readout is called
14:47 - quantum superposition
14:50 - and we'll need that very soon
14:54 - another gate i'll gonna i'm gonna show
14:56 - you is called the pauli x-gate now the
14:59 - x-gate is much much simpler
15:02 - to understand than the
15:04 - uh the hadamard gate because basically
15:07 - if you have it at 0 and apply an x-gate
15:11 - it just takes the x-axis and spins it
15:14 - around there by 180 degrees giving you
15:17 - the opposite value so this is basically
15:19 - just a not
15:21 - around the x-axis
15:24 - not as easy enough to understand right
15:29 - but it gets more complicated if you go
15:32 - to another gate which incorporates part
15:34 - of what you know from the x-gate now so
15:37 - the conditional not or c naught gate is
15:40 - where things get
15:41 - really exciting
15:44 - and basically this operates on two
15:48 - qubits
15:49 - we have the
15:51 - the control qubit
15:53 - at zero here and we have the target
15:55 - qubit
15:56 - and if we apply
15:59 - a c naught with
16:00 - the control qubit at zero
16:03 - well
16:04 - nothing happens everything stays the
16:07 - same
16:08 - if we have
16:11 - a one on the control qubit and apply the
16:14 - c naught
16:16 - it will flip so basically this is the
16:18 - behavior we know from the x gate
16:21 - but what happens if our control q gate
16:24 - is in superposition
16:25 - if it could be measured as 0 or 1
16:31 - we get something like this
16:35 - so we now have two arrows in that second
16:39 - qubit
16:40 - basically it's a bit like this
16:44 - because if you were to measure
16:46 - either of the gates
16:49 - you would get the value
16:51 - of both gates
16:53 - they are combined they are locked
16:56 - together if you have zero in the first
16:58 - one you'll get zero in the second one
16:59 - because nothing happens if you get one
17:01 - in the first one you'll get one in the
17:03 - second one because everything happened
17:05 - this is the situation we had with our
17:07 - radioactive isotope and our cat earlier
17:10 - this is quantum entanglement
17:14 - and
17:15 - quantum entanglement combined with
17:18 - quantum superposition
17:20 - is what makes quantum computers and
17:22 - quantum mechanics in general tick
17:26 - now
17:27 - we don't actually have
17:30 - this until we measure before we measure
17:33 - we basically just have
17:35 - both in superposition
17:39 - and
17:41 - as long as they're in superposition we
17:42 - can do some really funky stuff with
17:45 - these qubits
17:47 - now i've shown you a few
17:50 - quantum gates namely the hadamard and
17:51 - the
17:52 - c naught gate i've shown you one of the
17:55 - three pauli gates there are y and z
17:58 - power gates as well they just spin
18:00 - around their
18:01 - axes
18:03 - by 180 degrees those axis just being y
18:06 - or zed
18:08 - there's also stuff like the identity
18:10 - gate which is the most boring gate ever
18:12 - because it just does nothing
18:15 - um
18:16 - there are phase gates which are
18:19 - pretty exciting you can do some uh
18:22 - pretty neat stuff with those i'm not
18:24 - going to get into the phase gates today
18:25 - but you can read up on them if you like
18:28 - i'll have some material
18:30 - and some links for you later and there
18:32 - are many many other types of gates you
18:34 - can imagine
18:36 - so
18:38 - okay we now know roughly how it works
18:42 - but
18:43 - why do we need this what are the use
18:45 - cases
18:46 - and there are quite a few use cases
18:48 - actually um for example
18:51 - the big one that if you've heard
18:53 - anything about quantum computing you've
18:55 - heard about this it can break encryption
18:58 - and it can break encryption because at
19:00 - least in theory it can break it because
19:03 - it's really good at prime factorization
19:07 - quantum computers can factorize numbers
19:10 - much more efficiently in theory at least
19:13 - than your regular binary computers can
19:15 - do it
19:17 - if you want to know more about that
19:18 - check out shaw's algorithm
19:22 - something you may not have heard of
19:25 - various companies including google and
19:27 - volkswagen are using quantum computers
19:30 - now to assist them in engineering tasks
19:35 - you could
19:37 - simulate
19:38 - molecules and atoms on quantum computers
19:41 - you actually have a quantum state there
19:44 - so you can easily
19:47 - work with quantum
19:49 - properties
19:50 - and this can be really useful in
19:52 - research in physics and chemistry and
19:55 - medicine of course
19:57 - so this could be really really exciting
20:01 - um
20:02 - other than that
20:03 - how about ai or machine learning
20:07 - there are quite a few attempts to use
20:10 - quantum computers in those areas
20:13 - and
20:15 - i think it's pretty safe to say that
20:18 - those will be some of the first fields
20:21 - that will we as developers will really
20:24 - meet quantum computers
20:26 - at least in the wild
20:30 - then
20:31 - you can use it for weather prediction
20:33 - you can use quantum computers for
20:35 - pretty much any field that is
20:38 - nowadays added by heuristics because
20:41 - heuristics are just a shortcut because
20:44 - you are unable to calculate everything
20:47 - but quantum computers will allow you to
20:50 - calculate well not everything but much
20:52 - much more
20:53 - than you can nowadays
20:57 - financial fraud is another use case that
20:59 - some people are looking into
21:01 - again a field where heuristics is large
21:06 - nasa is using quantum computers early
21:08 - quantum computers admittedly
21:11 - in their engineering tasks so that's
21:14 - similar to the volkswagen case and just
21:17 - to jump on the bandwagon
21:19 - quantum computers could break bitcoin
21:22 - so
21:23 - if you have bitcoins you'll probably
21:24 - save for a couple of years until we have
21:26 - quantum computers that are powerful
21:28 - enough but don't wait too long to sell
21:30 - them
21:32 - okay so
21:34 - these are
21:36 - interesting use cases i guess
21:38 - but there's much more that could be done
21:41 - now most people who nowadays are into
21:43 - quantum computers
21:45 - are scientists
21:47 - physicists as i said engineers etc
21:50 - and they come up with
21:53 - solutions to the problems they know
21:56 - we are the ones who will have to program
21:58 - them eventually so
22:01 - we need people who are in the
22:04 - programming field
22:05 - who are in the software development
22:07 - field
22:09 - to
22:10 - have a look at quantum computers try
22:12 - them out work with them see what they
22:15 - can do
22:16 - we will come up with other use cases use
22:18 - cases that so far nobody has thought of
22:22 - and this is basically why i'm doing this
22:25 - talk today because
22:27 - we have to get into quantum computing
22:29 - and we can
22:30 - so
22:32 - um
22:33 - that's why we as a community should get
22:35 - into it why should you personally get
22:37 - into it well there's this wonderful
22:39 - quote from venkat
22:41 - basically if you want to learn something
22:43 - new learn something that's totally
22:45 - different from anything you know
22:47 - because it will help you think
22:48 - differently
22:50 - it's a wonderful quote
22:52 - and
22:53 - believe me quantum computer programming
22:56 - is different from what you know
22:58 - so i'm going to show you two examples
23:00 - today of how you can actually today
23:03 - start programming for quantum computers
23:06 - the first one i'm going to show you is
23:09 - the ibm quantum experience
23:11 - so
23:12 - ibm
23:13 - has built
23:15 - real quantum computers early prototypes
23:18 - but they are real nevertheless and
23:20 - they're basically offering them as a
23:23 - kind of quantum computer in the cloud
23:26 - service
23:28 - how does that work well
23:30 - first of all
23:31 - the computers they built look something
23:34 - like this and
23:37 - for the moments yes i hope they'll
23:39 - shrink considerably um actually this
23:42 - part here
23:43 - most of that is a freezer well a
23:47 - cryostat but basically a huge freezer
23:50 - the chip itself looks something like
23:52 - this this is a seven qubit chip those
23:54 - are the qubits here and it has to be
23:56 - cooled down to
23:58 - well basically as cold as it can get
24:01 - because they are based on
24:03 - superconductivity
24:05 - and superconductivity
24:08 - well it works best if you have really
24:11 - really cold states
24:13 - now you can use this quantum computer
24:16 - well not that specific one but uh ones
24:19 - that they're providing via their website
24:22 - this is uh the entry sites to the
24:25 - quantum experience they have great
24:26 - learning materials there by the way so
24:29 - um if you're interested in this later
24:32 - you can check it out
24:33 - it's great once you log in
24:36 - the place you'll spend most of your time
24:38 - probably is this this is called the
24:40 - quantum composer
24:42 - and up here we have information about
24:45 - the quantum computers that you can use
24:48 - they currently offer for free by the way
24:51 - two different five qubit computers
24:54 - that anyone can use they also have in
24:58 - their quantum experience in theory a 20
25:00 - qubit quantum computer that's only open
25:02 - to their partners
25:04 - and it gives you some information about
25:06 - those computers now i think it's
25:08 - difficult to read but uh the top
25:10 - um
25:11 - quantum computer
25:13 - it's cool down to
25:15 - 0.012
25:17 - kelvins that's colder than in out of
25:20 - space
25:21 - that's why they have this huge
25:23 - cryostat that huge freezer
25:26 - and
25:28 - as you'll see very soon that's still not
25:31 - really enough
25:33 - so the main parts however is this part
25:36 - the composer interface and it's named so
25:39 - because it looks like you know a musical
25:42 - score
25:43 - and you do call the programs often
25:46 - quantum scores
25:48 - also you have here your q gates now
25:50 - you'll recognize some of them there's
25:52 - the h for hadamard
25:54 - there's the
25:55 - the plus symbol that's the c naught
25:58 - um you see the green x that's the x gate
26:01 - and there are some other ones as well
26:04 - so
26:04 - let's say we want to implement an
26:06 - algorithm in this and we'll go with
26:09 - something we already know
26:11 - schrodinger's cat
26:14 - very simple algorithm to implement not
26:16 - much log logic in it
26:18 - but
26:19 - it's a start so what do we need apart
26:21 - from the cat well we need our
26:24 - radioactive matter
26:26 - we need our modified geiger counter
26:31 - we need our cyanide
26:34 - and all of those have to be linked
26:36 - in some way they have to be entangled
26:40 - and if we lay that out
26:42 - in our quantum
26:44 - uh composer it will look something like
26:46 - this so the radioactive meta we already
26:49 - learned that is in quantum superposition
26:52 - so we can achieve that through the
26:54 - hadamard gate
26:57 - we then link
26:59 - all of the other items so the
27:02 - uh the geiger counter and the cyanide
27:04 - and the cat through cnot gates
27:07 - because basically if
27:10 - um
27:11 - if the hadamard reads out as one that
27:13 - means that the
27:15 - radioactive matter has decayed and in
27:17 - that case all the other qubits should
27:19 - also flip they all start out as zero and
27:22 - if the first one flips everything should
27:25 - turn to one and looking into the box
27:28 - is
27:29 - basically this pink symbol here the
27:30 - measurement gate
27:32 - in fact let's measure all of the gates
27:33 - we're modifying here
27:35 - and see what we get now
27:38 - you can run this as i said on a real
27:41 - quantum computer
27:43 - it's sent to their quantum computer
27:45 - there's a scheduling system etc and
27:48 - after a while you get back your result
27:50 - and your results well part of the result
27:52 - will look like this
27:54 - so
27:55 - what does this mean um
27:57 - at the bottom we have the various
28:00 - measurement values ignore the first
28:01 - value because that's the qubit we didn't
28:03 - measure
28:05 - and
28:06 - what we see is here
28:08 - this is the
28:09 - case where everything's zero nothing
28:11 - happened
28:13 - so that's a big peak
28:14 - back here we have the case where
28:17 - everything happened everything's a one
28:20 - cat's dead
28:22 - and each of those two results come to
28:25 - about 30 i think i've ran this test a
28:27 - thousand times
28:29 - and
28:30 - you get 30 each
28:33 - which leaves
28:34 - 40 percent of these results
28:38 - so what are those well
28:40 - those are measurement errors
28:43 - see this is still an early prototype and
28:46 - it makes mistakes
28:48 - and quantum error correction is actually
28:50 - a huge
28:51 - research field right now things are
28:54 - getting better
28:56 - but
28:57 - you do have to keep in mind that
28:59 - you can't believe all of the results at
29:02 - the moment that you're getting there is
29:03 - some randomness in there basically due
29:06 - to the fact among other things at least
29:08 - that it's not at absolute zero it is
29:10 - those you know 21 milli kelvins above
29:14 - zero which isn't much but
29:17 - it's still a bit too warm
29:20 - so that's
29:22 - the quantum experience the other tool i
29:24 - would like to show you today is the
29:27 - microsoft quantum development kit
29:30 - now
29:31 - this
29:32 - the the ibm quantum experience is
29:35 - basically a drag and drop editor you can
29:38 - write
29:38 - regular code as well they have a
29:40 - programming language
29:42 - and it translates back and forth between
29:43 - the graphical interface and that
29:46 - language
29:48 - in most cases at least for learning
29:50 - purposes you will probably use the
29:52 - graphical interface
29:55 - the quantum development kit by microsoft
29:58 - comes with a language called q sharp
30:01 - this looks much more like the code we're
30:04 - used to
30:06 - and as i said it's from microsoft so
30:10 - initially it was only available for
30:12 - windows and i thought during the
30:14 - preparations for this presentation i'd
30:16 - have to tell you well if you have
30:18 - anything but windows tough luck but
30:21 - about a month ago they said hey it's now
30:23 - available for
30:25 - linux and mac os as well
30:28 - so
30:29 - everyone can download it everyone can
30:31 - start playing around with it
30:34 - yes
30:36 - okay so
30:38 - you can do it let's have a look at what
30:40 - it looks like if you actually do do it
30:43 - so
30:44 - the language q sharp is heavily inspired
30:47 - by other.net languages as you would
30:49 - assume
30:50 - and it does actually run inside a.net
30:53 - environment
30:56 - here we have a very simple program most
30:58 - of it's blurred out at the moment
31:00 - it's not something about your eyes it
31:02 - really should look like that and we'll
31:04 - go through the program step by step so
31:07 - what do we have first of all
31:09 - here we're applying a hadamard gate to
31:12 - our isotope h isotope
31:14 - and then we apply the c naught to the
31:18 - isotope and the geiger counter and
31:20 - another c naught to the geiger counter
31:22 - and the cyanide another
31:24 - c naught to the cyanide and the cat you
31:27 - know this
31:28 - and
31:30 - it's just
31:31 - written down as code it's the same
31:33 - algorithm as we did before
31:36 - what else do we have because there's
31:38 - obviously more code well
31:40 - first of all we define a mutable
31:43 - value what we would call a variable in
31:46 - most languages
31:48 - most things in q sharp are immutable by
31:51 - default
31:52 - we want this to be mutable and this
31:55 - variable is supposed to represent the
31:58 - state of the cat is it alive or is it
32:00 - dead
32:03 - this is a simple one it's not a qubit
32:06 - value this is a binary value
32:11 - here we check
32:13 - in the box whether the cat is alive or
32:15 - dead
32:16 - m
32:17 - is the measurement value this is the
32:19 - pink thing you saw in the quantum
32:21 - experience same concept and then at the
32:24 - end we return you know is the cat alive
32:26 - or is it dead
32:29 - okay simple enough what else do we have
32:32 - we have boilerplate basically so
32:36 - here we say
32:37 - this
32:39 - algorithm needs four qubits
32:41 - we have to state explicitly how many we
32:44 - need
32:45 - they will be provided by the language
32:49 - then we give them proper names normally
32:51 - you have an array of qubits and that's
32:54 - fine initially but
32:57 - you can't throw best practices out of
32:59 - the window just because we have a new
33:00 - languages language here we do have to
33:03 - give the
33:04 - the qubits names so we can understand
33:06 - what we're doing
33:10 - then we initialize them all to zero
33:12 - the quantum experience did this for us
33:15 - everything was initially
33:17 - set to zero
33:19 - q sharp does not do this fast we have to
33:21 - do it manually
33:23 - and at the end we're setting them back
33:26 - to zero
33:27 - now the reason we have to set them to
33:29 - zero initially and at the end
33:32 - is basically
33:34 - decay
33:36 - quantum decay means that a qubit will
33:40 - always strive to some kind of
33:42 - equilibrium
33:44 - state
33:45 - we want to make sure it's not in
33:47 - equilibrium but rather it's in a
33:50 - defined states that we can work with
33:53 - and
33:54 - you could leave out language wise the
33:57 - initializing
33:58 - to zero
34:00 - then would you would just get random
34:02 - results
34:03 - q sharp forces you actually to set them
34:06 - back to zero when you're finished
34:11 - and that's basically all of the q sharp
34:13 - code now this runs in the net
34:15 - environment which means we can access it
34:17 - from other.net languages and so here we
34:20 - have a few lines of c sharp code
34:23 - which basically say well here
34:26 - create a quantum simulator to run my
34:28 - algorithm in
34:30 - run the algorithm in that quantum
34:32 - simulator and then tell me what the
34:34 - result is
34:37 - and
34:38 - you can run this code on your computer
34:40 - it runs it
34:42 - just this once in this case
34:45 - and it'll either tell you the cat's
34:47 - alive or the cat is dead
34:49 - and that's it this will run
34:51 - on your computer
34:55 - so
34:56 - we have a quantum simulator here and
34:58 - that may beg the question
35:02 - then why don't we just simulate it why
35:04 - do we need a real quantum computer
35:07 - it obviously works so why don't we just
35:10 - simulate everything
35:12 - and
35:14 - don't have those measurement errors you
35:16 - don't have the hassle it's a huge
35:18 - financial investment
35:20 - that
35:21 - companies like ibm for example
35:24 - and many universities
35:26 - are taking on why do they care
35:29 - and
35:30 - i'd like to go back to a previous slide
35:33 - to answer that question remember this
35:35 - slide
35:37 - now in theory the slide is designed in
35:40 - such a way that when i press my button
35:43 - here
35:44 - it will have a smooth transition from
35:46 - the dead cats to gravestones
35:49 - i clicked
35:54 - yeah that wasn't smooth
35:57 - my computer is having difficulties with
36:00 - powerpoint
36:02 - and
36:04 - what stress would a quantum computer put
36:08 - on a
36:09 - binary computer
36:10 - well ibm actually looked into this issue
36:14 - and they published a paper last year
36:18 - they
36:20 - had two quantum computers that they
36:22 - simulated one of them was a
36:25 - 49 cubit computer and they needed four
36:28 - and a half terabytes of ram
36:31 - one of them was a
36:32 - 56 cubic computer and that needed three
36:35 - terabytes of ram note that this wasn't
36:37 - the same algorithm
36:39 - and maybe the algorithm they used for
36:42 - the latter was more optimized
36:45 - it's still
36:46 - much more than we have on our
36:48 - development machines there are computers
36:50 - with that kind of memory available of
36:52 - course but
36:55 - you don't have them
36:56 - sitting at home i would assume if you do
36:58 - let me know
37:00 - i might come by
37:02 - um
37:03 - so this was a huge success
37:05 - and you'll see why it was a huge success
37:08 - with this line here
37:12 - previously
37:14 - those kind of simulations would have
37:15 - needed eight petabytes of ram for the 49
37:18 - qubits machine and
37:20 - an extra byte of ram for the 56 qubit
37:23 - machine
37:24 - let me repeat that
37:26 - one exabytes of ram
37:30 - can you imagine how much an extra byte
37:31 - is probably not so let me break this
37:33 - down for you one exabyte is a thousand
37:37 - petabytes which is a million gigabytes a
37:40 - terabyte sorry which depending on
37:42 - whether you speak british or american
37:44 - english is a milliard or a billion
37:46 - gigabytes that's 10 to the 18 bytes of
37:50 - ram
37:51 - so intensity 18 bytes that's hard to
37:54 - imagine
37:55 - our universe according to current
37:57 - estimates is
38:00 - 13.7 times 10 to the nine years old that
38:03 - translates to 4.32 times 10 to the 17
38:07 - seconds that's less than half
38:09 - the amount of bytes we have in an
38:11 - exabyte
38:13 - so the improvement that
38:15 - ibm made there by getting it down to the
38:18 - terabyte range is astonishing
38:22 - but
38:23 - as
38:24 - the number of qubits grows that you have
38:27 - to emulate
38:28 - or simulate
38:30 - and as the algorithms grow that you want
38:33 - to simulate on those simulations of
38:36 - quantum computers
38:37 - things will get
38:39 - well even more unrealistic than they are
38:41 - right now
38:43 - so at least for the time being we are
38:45 - stuck with actual physical quantum
38:47 - computers now this
38:49 - here is a 50 qubit quantum computer
38:52 - that's ibm built and until recently i
38:54 - thought this would be the largest
38:56 - machine i'd be able to show you
38:59 - about two weeks ago google came along
39:01 - and said hey
39:03 - we have this thing here we call it
39:04 - bristlecone and it has 72 qubits and
39:08 - apparently very low error rates
39:11 - now when they announced it the testing
39:13 - wasn't fully completed so we can't be
39:15 - absolutely sure what the error rates
39:17 - look like
39:19 - but it's promising
39:22 - note the
39:24 - uh the 50 qubit machine i showed you i
39:26 - think that was from earlier this year
39:29 - this is from two weeks ago things are
39:31 - moving really rapidly
39:34 - um and
39:35 - ibm and google aren't the only companies
39:38 - in the game here for example intel is
39:40 - also working on
39:42 - quantum computers
39:44 - um at the beginning of the the year they
39:46 - introduced a 49 cubits quantum computer
39:50 - after some previous iterations the
39:52 - largest one in the picture is the 49
39:54 - qubit one and um
39:57 - alibaba the chinese internet giant
40:02 - announced
40:03 - in early march that they were offering a
40:06 - quantum computer in the cloud similar to
40:09 - what ibm
40:10 - is offering
40:12 - now as i said earlier ibm
40:14 - to certain partners offers a 20 qubit
40:17 - computer this here
40:19 - offered by alibaba is an 11 qubit
40:22 - computer which is the second largest one
40:24 - available
40:25 - at least it's available to some people i
40:28 - registered with alibaba
40:29 - looked for anything
40:31 - and i could only find this announcement
40:34 - so
40:35 - apparently it is available in theory but
40:37 - only two well probably members of the
40:40 - university with which they are doing
40:41 - this or the research institution i
40:43 - should say
40:44 - um
40:46 - but things are gonna happen
40:49 - quantum computers will become more and
40:51 - more available in the next
40:54 - months and especially years
40:57 - and
41:00 - so this is uh the breaking point this is
41:03 - the point where
41:05 - people like us have to get started and
41:08 - can get started with quantum computing
41:11 - so if you want to get started what can
41:13 - you do well
41:16 - as i said earlier there's
41:18 - the quantum experience you can register
41:20 - there it's all free
41:23 - um and they have great learning material
41:26 - here's the url i will make the slides
41:28 - available online so you don't have to
41:31 - remember that
41:32 - qrl right now great
41:35 - uh great tool for learning
41:37 - there is as i said the ib the microsoft
41:40 - quantum development kit available for
41:44 - yeah sure
41:46 - sure
41:47 - um i'll still speak about the next slide
41:50 - there's the microsoft quantum
41:52 - development kit available for windows
41:54 - mac and linux
41:56 - this also is absolutely free of charge
42:00 - and available under this url if you want
42:02 - to take pictures
42:04 - now would be the time
42:08 - and also
42:10 - about one and a half weeks ago
42:12 - stack exchange who run this tiny site
42:15 - called stack overflow you may heard of
42:18 - um
42:19 - they opened a private beta for a quantum
42:24 - computing
42:25 - site
42:26 - now it's a private beta so you can only
42:28 - join by invitation
42:31 - if you want to join let me know i can
42:34 - i can get an invitation to you and
42:37 - that's
42:38 - uh well the site is at this address of
42:40 - course my invitations aren't um but just
42:43 - let me know
42:45 - and
42:47 - well apart from that i would say
42:51 - it's time to explore try these tools
42:54 - play around with them read the tutorials
42:57 - there's much much more than i got to
42:59 - cover today in the information material
43:02 - provided by for example ibm and
43:04 - microsoft and of course other sources
43:07 - um play around with it and hopefully
43:10 - we'll get some really cool results
43:15 - and
43:16 - now
43:17 - ask your questions
43:26 - that adds two numbers
43:29 - that's a good
43:31 - question um
43:32 - if you want to add two numbers
43:35 - well in theory a very simple adder would
43:38 - be just a c naught if you have
43:40 - zero and zero you get zero if you have
43:42 - zero and one you have one if you have
43:45 - one and zero you have one if you have
43:46 - one and one you get zero because of
43:48 - overflow
43:50 - um
43:52 - but
43:53 - you always have the problem of
43:55 - measurement error here
43:57 - you probably don't want to build
43:59 - something like an adder
44:01 - in a quantum computer
44:06 - um
44:07 - the profile of quantum computing
44:09 - applications for one as i said earlier
44:12 - is anything that's nowadays or many
44:15 - things at least that nowadays you would
44:16 - improve with heuristics
44:19 - um
44:21 - so you'll probably be able to improve
44:23 - those with quantum computers
44:26 - um
44:27 - among these things are
44:29 - well
44:30 - uh prime factor prime factoring of
44:33 - course you can
44:35 - you can do that
44:36 - nowadays you would basically have to
44:40 - try all possible combinations and you
44:42 - can improve that with heuristics but
44:44 - it's
44:44 - it's difficult
44:46 - another issue
44:48 - that can be solved with quantum
44:49 - computers is unstructured search there's
44:52 - an algorithm called grover's algorithm
44:54 - where basically if you have a data set
44:57 - and you know nothing about
44:59 - how it may or may not be sorted
45:03 - with any regular binary computer would
45:05 - you would have to look at each separate
45:08 - entry and check is that the one i'm
45:10 - looking for is that the one i'm looking
45:11 - for is that the one i'm looking for if
45:13 - you have n entries you'd need
45:15 - potentially n tries it's certainly an o
45:16 - of n grover's algorithm can do it in o
45:20 - of square root of n
45:23 - basically
45:24 - by using
45:25 - this
45:26 - uh this state
45:28 - of superposition
45:31 - and looking at several values at the
45:32 - same time
45:34 - so
45:35 - anything that goes into the area of
45:38 - breadth search is a potential candidate
45:40 - as well
45:42 - and there are probably many many other
45:44 - problems you can look at that
45:47 - so simply nobody has really looked into
45:50 - yet i'm pretty convinced that it's
45:52 - possible to write a proper sorting
45:54 - algorithm with a quantum computer i
45:56 - haven't seen anyone do it yet and i
45:57 - haven't been able to come up with one
45:59 - myself
46:00 - but i do think it's possible we just
46:02 - have to find the proper algorithm
46:06 - okay
46:38 - will not be
46:39 - represented
46:48 - okay so basically the question is can
46:50 - quantum computers help with floating
46:52 - points
46:53 - uh decimal representation infinite
46:57 - floating points the answer is i don't
46:59 - know um maybe there's a way
47:02 - i haven't seen anything about that so
47:04 - far
47:06 - in theory
47:08 - i would say it is possible because you
47:10 - could choose some kind of representation
47:12 - within the block sphere
47:14 - um
47:15 - where each points on the sphere is a
47:18 - possible value and that in theory at
47:21 - least
47:21 - would be
47:23 - infinitely many values
47:25 - measuring those is a bit more difficult
47:27 - because you get either zero or one so
47:30 - i
47:31 - can't think of a way to represent uh
47:33 - infinitely long binary number uh
47:36 - floating point numbers off the top of my
47:38 - head but
47:40 - that doesn't mean that there isn't a way
47:42 - to do it
48:03 - okay so basically how do you represent
48:06 - numbers at all in a quantum computer um
48:10 - basically the same way
48:13 - at least you can do it the same way you
48:14 - do with a binary computer because
48:17 - um when you measure your values they
48:19 - will be zero or one you don't get a
48:22 - value on the sphere
48:24 - um
48:25 - you get zero or ones with certain
48:27 - probabilities
48:29 - there may be better ways of representing
48:31 - numbers in quantum computers
48:35 - again i don't know
48:37 - um it's something you can certainly look
48:39 - into there probably is a better way to
48:41 - do it
48:43 - but we're in the early stages where that
48:45 - kind of question
48:47 - is still something
48:49 - that as far as i'm aware hasn't been
48:52 - fully answered
48:54 - so you can go with a basic
48:56 - representation where zeros and ones
48:59 - uh give you your results just like with
49:02 - a binary representation on a binary
49:04 - computer and
49:06 - anything from there onwards
49:09 - is up to research
49:12 - yeah
49:40 - okay
49:41 - so how do cubits work on a technical
49:44 - level
49:45 - um i'm no expert in this field basically
49:49 - i can tell you that there are
49:51 - at least i don't know four or five
49:53 - different ways in which people have
49:55 - started building qubits
49:59 - the
50:01 - super conductor method that is used by
50:05 - ibm and google and quite a few other
50:10 - hardware manufacturers is currently the
50:12 - most successful method
50:16 - how exactly that works i'd have to check
50:18 - myself there are some other ways that
50:21 - don't necessarily require super cooling
50:25 - and
50:26 - those could be very promising in the
50:28 - long run because basically if you want
50:31 - to have
50:32 - a quantum computer with you if you want
50:34 - to have it in your laptop in your car in
50:36 - your phone
50:37 - you don't want to have you know a huge
50:39 - cryostat that you have to carry with you
50:42 - you don't want to have to call it to as
50:44 - close to absolute zero as you
50:47 - can get
50:48 - um
50:50 - currently
50:51 - to my understanding at least those
50:53 - technologies aren't as uh as
50:56 - advanced as the
50:58 - superconducting methods and
51:01 - so we'll have to see where those go
51:05 - does that answer your question great
51:09 - any other questions
51:14 - yeah sure
51:15 - sure
51:24 - with microsoft yes with ibm you can run
51:28 - it on a simulator
51:29 - um basically you have two options when
51:31 - you have your code in the quantum
51:34 - experience you can choose the simulate
51:37 - button and then it will run automatic uh
51:39 - not automatically it will run
51:41 - immediately on a simulator and you'll
51:43 - get back your result in no time
51:46 - you can
51:47 - say run it on the real quantum computer
51:49 - and they have a scheduling system
51:52 - um i'm not going to get into it it's
51:54 - easily explained and then they do send
51:57 - your code to the actual quantum computer
52:00 - they have in their facilities will run
52:02 - your code there and after a while you
52:04 - get back your result and this is actual
52:07 - quantum
52:09 - quantum computing happening
52:12 - that's
52:13 - what we saw when i showed you the
52:15 - results where we had all those errors if
52:17 - you run it on the simulator you get much
52:19 - nicer results
52:22 - which is great for testing but of course
52:24 - if you want a realistic image
52:26 - you should run it on the real device
52:31 - okay anyone else
52:33 - yeah
52:41 - can a quantum computer generate truly
52:44 - random numbers my guess is yes it can
52:48 - i'm
52:49 - no expert in randomness i must admit
52:53 - so
52:54 - you would have to ask someone who's
52:56 - more familiar with what constitutes two
53:00 - randomness but to my understanding yes
53:02 - it can
53:05 - okay anything else
53:08 - that case thank you for listening and no
53:12 - cats were harmed in the making of this
