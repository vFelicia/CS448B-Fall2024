00:03 - hey everybody
00:04 - welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:07 - jesse and today we're gonna do some css
00:11 - uh so
00:13 - not sass or
00:15 - css and js or anything like that just
00:18 - regular
00:19 - css this should be a great stream for
00:23 - beginners
00:24 - because usually if you want to get into
00:26 - web development you start out with
00:29 - html
00:30 - and css
00:32 - so
00:35 - i hope that we have no technical issues
00:38 - with the stream i can see my mic is
00:40 - working today
00:41 - and so far i've not dropped any frames
00:44 - so this might be the first
00:46 - successful stream uh from my my home
00:50 - office which is actually just a corner
00:52 - of my laundry room in my basement right
00:54 - now
00:56 - but don't not going to do a lengthy
00:59 - introduction i think you know we'll just
01:01 - get started i do want to show off my my
01:04 - t-shirt
01:06 - so this is the november
01:09 - t-shirt
01:10 - from the conference at the 2017 november
01:14 - conference so
01:15 - i thought it was pretty cool
01:17 - they had cool stuff there
01:19 - i know uh you've seen
01:22 - i think i've worn other stuff
01:24 - before or put it on instagram or
01:26 - something there's a t-shirt a hoodie
01:29 - a november hat
01:32 - uh i can get socks from that conference
01:35 - the socks were from heroku but
01:38 - anyway
01:40 - just wanted to show that off uh before
01:42 - we get started
01:44 - if you're new to the stream let me just
01:46 - give you a very quick rundown of how
01:48 - things go this stream is not exactly a
01:51 - tutorial uh instead this is my
01:53 - day-to-day work as a front-end developer
01:56 - for a small university
01:59 - so whatever i need to work on that day i
02:01 - just pick whatever i think will be the
02:03 - most interesting thing and then i stream
02:05 - it
02:06 - for about an hour or so
02:09 - but i take breaks to answer questions
02:11 - and i try to narrate what i'm doing
02:14 - so that you know hopefully it's
02:16 - beneficial to you all that watch and
02:18 - then you can give me
02:20 - you know your your feedback and and your
02:22 - help and ideas as i go along so it ends
02:24 - up being very collaborative
02:27 - i time these with a pomodoro timer which
02:30 - means for 25 minutes i i mostly code and
02:34 - don't really look too much at the live
02:36 - chat then i take a little break and i
02:38 - answer questions to live chat then i go
02:40 - back and do another 25 minute session
02:43 - and then after that i go back and and
02:44 - the final part of the stream is just all
02:47 - question and answer
02:48 - and
02:49 - sometimes that takes a long time
02:51 - sometimes it doesn't it entirely depends
02:52 - on you and and your questions
02:55 - this is definitely beginner friendly
02:57 - feel free to ask any questions don't
02:59 - worry about you know if you think your
03:01 - question is is a silly question
03:04 - don't worry about it uh you know we're
03:06 - all trying to learn here and get better
03:08 - and we're always trying to be very
03:10 - helpful if somebody is being
03:12 - uh not very nice in the chat then
03:15 - i will talk to them about that i i've
03:18 - only had to ban somebody once
03:21 - uh so you know we've been doing these
03:23 - streams for almost a year now and so we
03:25 - have a pretty good track record of
03:27 - having you know kind of a positive
03:30 - uh experience here
03:32 - so
03:34 - having said that
03:36 - uh let's get started
03:39 - so i'm going to start my pomodoro clock
03:42 - and i'm going to start out by
03:45 - just showing you what's
03:47 - uh what we're going to work on so i want
03:49 - to go to the
03:52 - major.js page if you all want to follow
03:55 - along uh where you know at home you can
03:58 - go to the github repository that's
04:00 - linked in the description to this video
04:04 - and
04:07 - check out this major.js component that's
04:10 - in the pages folder
04:12 - that's where we're going to spend most
04:14 - of our time well i take that back we're
04:17 - probably going to create a css file and
04:19 - that's where we're going to spend most
04:20 - of our time so
04:22 - it's probably not a bad idea to see if
04:24 - we already have one
04:25 - style
04:27 - that would be under
04:28 - static
04:30 - styles
04:32 - no we don't so we we actually don't have
04:34 - a css file for this component so that's
04:37 - kind of nice we'll start from a blank
04:39 - one
04:40 - and
04:42 - now i'm going to let you see what we
04:44 - need to style it's it's a little bit
04:46 - tricky
04:49 - so we have a lot of freedom with what
04:52 - we're going to turn this into
04:58 - oops
04:59 - let me switch the scene
05:02 - so you all can see
05:07 - and
05:12 - oops
05:17 - there we go
05:19 - okay
05:22 - all right so this
05:25 - is what we currently have this is the
05:27 - the current site that we're redoing
05:31 - so there's this
05:33 - thing here
05:34 - where user can click
05:37 - and
05:38 - get
05:39 - you know potentially what their schedule
05:41 - could be if they decided to come to the
05:43 - university and
05:45 - uh take
05:46 - uh be a classics major right so i got
05:50 - some feedback from some current students
05:53 - and they said that they really liked
05:54 - this
05:56 - and this helped them a lot when they
05:57 - were deciding so
05:59 - i do want to make this
06:01 - nicer
06:02 - this is what it looks like currently
06:06 - so we brought over all the markup
06:09 - and none of the styles
06:11 - so it's just a list
06:15 - so our goal today
06:17 - is to take this list
06:22 - and turn it into something
06:25 - that basically does this it does not
06:28 - have to look like this
06:30 - at all
06:31 - we can completely change how this looks
06:33 - the but it just needs to
06:36 - in a reasonable way that
06:39 - would be nice for a user it needs to be
06:42 - able to display the classes that would
06:44 - be taken during
06:46 - you know during their different years
06:48 - and semesters
06:51 - and
06:53 - we have to work with the existing markup
06:56 - so potentially i could change the markup
06:59 - but
07:00 - there's a lot and
07:03 - we're running out of time before
07:06 - you know launch time so i'm thinking
07:10 - so this probably needs to be launched
07:13 - sometime in
07:17 - maybe this month
07:20 - let me think hold on a second let me
07:23 - when's the first day of
07:25 - summer
07:28 - is it june
07:33 - yeah it's june right
07:35 - so let's let's
07:38 - figure the launch date is going to be
07:39 - sometime in early june
07:41 - uh kind of at the latest
07:44 - so anyway
07:46 - i would like to just work with the
07:47 - markup as is at a later date we can go
07:50 - back
07:51 - and if we want to change markup and
07:53 - organize the data in a better way that's
07:55 - fine but otherwise i've just brought
07:57 - this over
08:00 - as is and that's what we're gonna work
08:01 - with
08:04 - all right michael says june 21st okay
08:07 - i thought it was june
08:10 - i just realized i haven't looked at all
08:12 - at the uh chat since we started so
08:15 - i am going to go back and read this
08:18 - i just want to scan quickly to make sure
08:20 - there's nothing wrong with my stream
08:22 - that you are telling me about
08:44 - okay
08:47 - all right looks like everything's good
08:48 - with the stream
08:50 - so first thing we're going to do is just
08:52 - check out what we have in devtools let's
08:55 - inspect it
08:57 - now i know on some streams i i have
09:00 - a tool running called ngrok that allows
09:03 - you to inspect things on your own
09:06 - computer i don't have ngrok running
09:08 - right now for two reasons one i don't
09:10 - even have it installed or set up on this
09:12 - computer
09:13 - but also
09:15 - i don't think this computer could handle
09:17 - running ngrok and doing a live stream at
09:20 - the same time i would like to test it
09:22 - out at some point it would have been
09:24 - good for this type of stream but
09:27 - uh now it's kind of too late
09:29 - to try it out anyway i didn't really
09:31 - think about it until we already started
09:34 - all right so i'm gonna make this a bit
09:36 - bigger
09:41 - let's see
09:44 - so
09:45 - right now what i'm just looking for is
09:47 - like what markup are we are we dealing
09:50 - with here what does this look like
09:53 - uh so let's see it looks like
09:57 - classics all right so we have an h2 at
10:00 - the top
10:03 - this is good oh and then
10:06 - okay so these are also h2s
10:09 - not really happy about that i mean this
10:11 - is obviously the header for the whole
10:13 - thing so
10:14 - i would have liked it if these were
10:16 - maybe h3s or something but that's what
10:18 - we have and then these are in
10:21 - left title tags so
10:24 - what we've noticed previously that when
10:26 - we're bringing over data from this older
10:28 - content management system called ektron
10:31 - we have a lot of custom elements
10:34 - so this is one of those
10:36 - a left title all right we have break
10:39 - tags
10:41 - we have left
10:43 - interesting
10:46 - we have tags that are just left tags
10:53 - and then
10:54 - wow even all the courses are h2s with a
10:57 - class of title
11:01 - and then a link
11:03 - we have a link tag that has
11:06 - nothing in it
11:10 - it looks like
11:13 - we have display none set on a link which
11:16 - i mean that that obviously makes sense
11:17 - right
11:20 - um
11:21 - okay so i'm assuming we're gonna have
11:23 - some right tags here so let's check it
11:25 - out
11:26 - okay right title
11:28 - and we have some right tags
11:34 - okay this is not
11:35 - this is not terrible let's see if you
11:38 - are
11:40 - okay and then this is a link
11:42 - and i already set up this route so this
11:44 - link actually works
11:47 - so that's what i was doing earlier today
11:49 - i was just going through cleaning up
11:51 - data setting up routes which is what
11:53 - i've been doing pretty much every day
11:55 - the last couple weeks there's a lot to
11:57 - go through
11:59 - all right and then each one of these
12:02 - is in a tab
12:05 - okay uh
12:07 - i think this markup is something we can
12:09 - work with this doesn't look
12:12 - it doesn't look
12:14 - it could have been a lot worse right
12:16 - based on what we were seeing before
12:18 - it could have been worse
12:20 - so
12:22 - i think this will work
12:25 - we
12:26 - should be able to do what we need to do
12:28 - so
12:29 - right off the bat
12:31 - i'm going to tell you what i'm thinking
12:32 - about doing and then you all can give me
12:34 - your feedback and and see if um
12:37 - if you have any you know any input maybe
12:40 - i'm missing something
12:41 - so
12:42 - i mean obviously i'm i'm going to use
12:44 - these
12:46 - left tags
12:49 - and left title
12:50 - for that's where i'm going to attach the
12:53 - positioning to so in our cr css we're
12:55 - going to target these and position them
12:59 - to the left or to the right
13:02 - since there's no like containers
13:07 - i'm thinking this is going to be tough
13:17 - yeah there's no containers around all
13:19 - this which is going to make it a little
13:20 - bit tough
13:22 - maybe we'll just do like old-fashioned
13:24 - floats
13:26 - and see if that works for our right and
13:29 - our left i mean normally i would go with
13:31 - something else
13:32 - but that's going to be maybe my first
13:35 - try
13:37 - and then
13:38 - it looks like these br tags are just way
13:41 - too much space so we may
13:43 - end up
13:46 - just setting these to like display none
13:49 - or something like that
13:51 - let's take it out
13:53 - okay
13:54 - yeah if we set display none on those
13:59 - that's that's a lot nicer
14:02 - alright so just like that that
14:04 - automatically looks more reasonable
14:06 - we're also going to have to change
14:09 - some of the styles
14:11 - on like these titles for semesters and
14:14 - years so right now there's no visual
14:16 - hierarchy in terms of
14:19 - font size font weight color or
14:21 - indentation
14:23 - so
14:23 - all that's going to have to change
14:29 - and then the the link styling will
14:31 - change this is just default link styling
14:34 - uh so we'll we'll switch that up but
14:38 - other than that it's not
14:41 - it's not really terrible uh
14:45 - yeah i don't think that's too bad
14:48 - we'll get that all figured out and then
14:50 - we'll see what it looks like with just
14:51 - having first year first semester
14:54 - and then side by side and then doing the
14:57 - same thing here
14:59 - and then we'll see like do we want to go
15:01 - back to some sort of tabbed version
15:04 - is it okay to just have them all right
15:05 - there
15:07 - i'm not really sure i want to see it
15:08 - first
15:09 - all right so let me look at the live
15:11 - chat since i've been asking a few
15:12 - questions here and see
15:15 - see what you all think
15:26 - all right i see i see a lot of questions
15:28 - in the chat right now so i will get to
15:30 - the questions so um
15:33 - in about
15:36 - about 15 minutes i'll get to the
15:38 - questions so please be patient
15:55 - let's see
16:05 - uh how many says so we'll not modify the
16:07 - html at all
16:09 - if
16:11 - potentially we can modify the html but
16:13 - if we do it it's going to be
16:15 - using javascript in the react component
16:19 - because
16:20 - i have a lot of pages that have markup
16:23 - just like this so i don't want to have
16:25 - to manually go in and and modify it
16:32 - oh and it har should just explain that
16:34 - so sorry i didn't see that okay well it
16:36 - looks like we're good to start in on
16:38 - this so
16:39 - first thing i want to do is is try to
16:41 - get this positioning uh working
16:45 - so let's go
16:47 - you know what let's just try to do a
16:48 - little bit right here in dev tools
16:53 - if you're very new uh to
16:56 - using you know dev tools
16:58 - you know if you just right click on
17:00 - anything in the page and then go down to
17:02 - inspect dev tools will come up if you've
17:05 - never used it before it'll come up and
17:07 - it'll be white instead of a black
17:08 - background you can just go into the
17:10 - settings up here
17:12 - and
17:13 - you can change that to a dark background
17:15 - if you want
17:17 - right so all the changes we're going to
17:18 - do here are just going to be temporary
17:20 - they're only working our browser so you
17:22 - don't have to worry about actually
17:23 - changing or messing up the code and you
17:25 - could do this for any website that you
17:27 - go on uh to just kind of mess with it
17:29 - and see how it works
17:30 - so we're going to take our left tags and
17:34 - let's see actually let me go with the
17:36 - right ones first
17:37 - let's see
17:39 - no i don't
17:41 - with the left
17:44 - so let's try a float left
17:47 - see how weird it looks
17:49 - all right so what did we just
17:53 - we just took all
17:55 - nope that's not gonna work
17:58 - you know what i didn't even think about
17:59 - that
18:03 - okay
18:04 - uh
18:06 - so let's leave that alone for now let's
18:07 - take our right ones
18:09 - let's see what we can do
18:13 - oh harsha says there's 101 people
18:15 - watching which is more i well i haven't
18:18 - even looked at the analytics at all
18:20 - wow
18:22 - so we're we're at 85 right now based on
18:24 - my analytics but that's still a lot of
18:26 - people so um forever new people uh
18:29 - welcome thanks for thanks for watching
18:32 - feel free to put any questions you have
18:33 - in the chat and uh i'll answer them
18:35 - after a little while
18:37 - all right so let's go with our our right
18:39 - tags
18:41 - and
18:43 - let's see what we can do
18:44 - so
18:48 - let's see what we can do
18:54 - hmm
18:59 - so i'm obviously the float's not gonna
19:01 - work right so if we do float right
19:04 - right we're gonna get some weirdness
19:06 - again
19:08 - uh so
19:09 - float is out for what we're doing right
19:11 - now but we could maybe do
19:19 - let's mess with the position oops and
19:21 - that did not
19:27 - position
19:30 - uh absolute
19:32 - no this is not
19:35 - this is gonna be trickier than i thought
19:38 - so the lack of a container
19:41 - is really
19:43 - messing this up
19:59 - all right
20:01 - one thing we can do
20:02 - is see what they used here in the old
20:05 - site
20:07 - assuming that they have the uh the same
20:11 - elements on the page
20:15 - all right
20:17 - oh so this ended up getting interpreted
20:19 - as
20:20 - ul
20:22 - uh unordered list wow
20:26 - okay so it looks like the old content
20:28 - management system
20:31 - took those those custom tags and
20:34 - converted them to
20:36 - normal html tags
20:39 - and ended up
20:41 - wrapping these
20:45 - so think of
20:47 - think of these
20:49 - as like components in react
20:52 - so
20:54 - no actually that doesn't make any sense
20:56 - either
21:01 - i'm not exactly sure how that that
21:03 - worked out because
21:06 - you know there's really not
21:08 - any type of container
21:20 - interesting okay let's start with
21:22 - something easier while we think about
21:25 - how we can do
21:26 - uh how we can do this
21:28 - let's just get
21:29 - uh the headings
21:33 - fixed in terms of
21:35 - uh the size font weight and color
21:41 - i have some ideas for how to handle the
21:43 - positioning
21:45 - but it's going to involve some
21:46 - javascript so i'd rather stick to css
21:49 - for now since that's what i
21:51 - i made the title of this video so i
21:52 - imagine there's a lot of people here for
21:54 - the css
21:56 - so let's do some css then
21:58 - and
21:59 - where are we at sample programs this h2
22:03 - is
22:06 - let's check we don't want it to be too
22:09 - much larger than this so let's look up
22:11 - what we have on this
22:13 - h1
22:15 - okay so we don't have anything special
22:16 - it's just default
22:24 - so probably not not really a bad idea to
22:26 - just keep it as is for now
22:29 - since it's it's the appropriate size and
22:32 - weight in relation to this
22:35 - but these
22:37 - h2s
22:44 - that's why
22:47 - i have an extra title here
22:54 - it's really interesting
22:57 - okay
22:58 - um
23:00 - wow these do not stand out at all
23:11 - all right we're gonna do some weird css
23:13 - here for a second
23:24 - so
23:27 - i'm going to write this
23:30 - let's set up our css
23:32 - our file
23:34 - so we have our styles right now
23:37 - in fact we use are we pulling in any
23:40 - styles
23:42 - okay we're actually pulling in the
23:43 - styles from news.css
23:47 - so you may want to pull
23:49 - those styles over
23:50 - let's make a new file first and we'll
23:52 - call this major.css
23:56 - to match our component of major.css
23:59 - let's check out our news.css
24:04 - and
24:05 - you know what let me make some more
24:07 - space here let's move this over because
24:09 - we're not really using it right now
24:11 - and we'll move our our terminal stuff
24:14 - down
24:17 - and then i'm gonna make this a bit
24:19 - bigger so it'll be easier for you all to
24:21 - see
24:23 - okay hopefully that
24:26 - is uh easier to see
24:28 - so what i'm gonna do is take everything
24:30 - that's currently in news dot css and i'm
24:33 - going to move it over to major
24:35 - dot css because i'm not sure what in
24:38 - this file
24:39 - is really making a difference in our our
24:42 - major uh
24:43 - js component so i'm going to save that
24:46 - let's go over to our component
24:50 - of major
24:52 - dot js
24:55 - sorry that for the lag it's just you're
24:58 - trying to run the live stream and
24:59 - everything else makes it a little slow
25:04 - so
25:05 - we're right now we're bringing in if you
25:08 - don't know what's going on in this
25:10 - particular component don't worry about
25:12 - it if you're not familiar with react you
25:14 - know
25:15 - it's it's totally cool if you don't
25:16 - understand but we're basically just
25:19 - importing
25:20 - styles all right with a link tag so that
25:23 - should be you know familiar to you from
25:25 - just you know writing normal html
25:28 - so we're going to pull in this major
25:31 - dot css file
25:35 - so now
25:36 - anything that we change here will be
25:38 - reflected
25:42 - ah
25:43 - let's see
25:44 - so let's go through this just a bit
25:49 - i'm gonna say okay so right now anything
25:52 - that is displaying is uh root
25:55 - gets display none
25:58 - and we did have something that was roots
26:01 - or was it
26:03 - i thought we had something yeah so
26:07 - it's root tabbed
26:11 - all right
26:13 - um we have
26:15 - probably some of these will be
26:21 - we won't necessarily uh need to keep
26:24 - them but we'll sort that out
26:26 - later on right now let's add some more
26:29 - styles to the bottom so
26:31 - what i want to target are h2s with the
26:34 - class of title
26:37 - so h2s dot
26:39 - title
26:42 - and then i want to say
26:48 - not
26:50 - um what do you want to do this
26:53 - is it first first of type
27:01 - i might have to look up the syntax
27:03 - so what i want to select is all the h2s
27:07 - that have
27:08 - the class of title
27:13 - except
27:14 - not
27:15 - oh you know what
27:20 - i was mistaken this h2 is just stacked
27:22 - so this one doesn't have the class of
27:23 - title
27:24 - so we're gonna we're good then
27:26 - okay that makes this a lot easier
27:32 - so normally i'm not
27:35 - i don't like manipulating h2s
27:40 - uh we still want this title
27:44 - so for in css what we're doing is
27:48 - selecting an h2
27:50 - and then we do dot title
27:52 - this right after that that means any h2s
27:55 - with the class of title
27:59 - if i had a space here
28:01 - this would mean
28:02 - any
28:03 - element with the class of title that
28:06 - exists inside of an h2 so you could see
28:09 - the little tooltip is displaying
28:12 - what it would be but now if we backspace
28:14 - it you can see we're looking for h2s
28:17 - with the class of title and only h2s
28:21 - okay so i know for most of you that's
28:22 - probably
28:23 - you know you're probably familiar with
28:25 - that but i i do want to try to explain
28:27 - as much as i can you know for anybody
28:29 - that's just just curious about
28:31 - web development
28:33 - uh just starting out
28:36 - so right now we're we're targeting
28:39 - these year titles so this first year
28:42 - you know second second year
28:46 - um
28:47 - so we want to make this
28:57 - so let's just test it out here
29:01 - font size
29:04 - 18 pixels
29:06 - okay so we're going to go up from there
29:09 - and let's
29:10 - see let's say 24 pixels
29:14 - i really don't want to go any more than
29:16 - 24 pixels on this one and we could do
29:19 - font weight
29:24 - and let's see
29:26 - 500
29:28 - okay 500 looks good that definitely
29:30 - makes it thinner
29:32 - and then
29:34 - can we do color
29:37 - let's make our color be rgba
29:41 - and we're going to use
29:43 - 0 0 0
29:46 - um
29:48 - 0.87
29:52 - oops i need commas don't i
29:55 - zero
29:56 - zero
30:00 - okay
30:02 - so i wasn't sure if that was the color
30:04 - or not
30:06 - but that's what color i want okay so
30:10 - let's go with that for now
30:13 - and also
30:14 - we need to remember to
30:17 - make those those br tags work so major
30:20 - route 239 br
30:23 - all right so we're definitely gonna have
30:24 - to override this
30:27 - style where is it getting that from
30:30 - that's weird
30:32 - okay so we're copy and pasting that in
30:34 - here
30:36 - and
30:38 - let's just
30:43 - want to fix the
30:46 - indentation on that and then uh
30:51 - let's go with vr
30:54 - display
31:02 - i hate to use important but let's just
31:04 - do it
31:11 - just for time i don't really want to go
31:12 - through this and try to figure out what
31:14 - exactly is going on with this so just to
31:16 - see what it looks like we're gonna go
31:17 - with uh
31:18 - important
31:20 - in there so
31:23 - um let's do a refresh
31:27 - make sure it's working
31:29 - all right cool so now we have
31:32 - we have that and my timer went off so
31:34 - let me take a short break
31:36 - and answer as many questions as i can
31:38 - there's a lot of questions here so if i
31:40 - don't get to yours this time i'll get to
31:42 - it after the second pomodoro session
31:44 - i'll spend the the entire end of the
31:46 - stream just answering questions
31:51 - let's see so i'm not going to read out
31:53 - all the comments just because there's so
31:56 - much in here uh
32:00 - do want to get uh to the questions
32:02 - though
32:06 - although i'll probably read out comments
32:07 - that are
32:09 - either
32:11 - maybe funny or flattering to me
32:13 - personally
32:15 - so
32:17 - for instance klaus says i look way
32:19 - better with the stubble instead of the
32:21 - beard
32:22 - thanks
32:24 - my wife agrees
32:30 - world's asked if i'm in the basement i
32:32 - am i am coding from a corner of my
32:35 - basement
32:37 - uh nilish asks when i'll continue the
32:40 - react testing video uh maybe later this
32:42 - week i was doing i was reading a lot of
32:45 - documentation on testing and i still
32:47 - could not figure out
32:49 - what
32:50 - i have to do
32:52 - uh for the the click
32:58 - i
32:59 - i i don't i'll i have to talk about this
33:01 - for like 20 minutes or not at all so i
33:04 - will do another stream about it when i
33:06 - figure it out
33:08 - uh remy asks how many monitors
33:10 - i have uh right now i have a macbook pro
33:13 - so there's a screen with that and then
33:14 - two external monitors hooked up
33:17 - and that's my setup at my offices as
33:19 - well except it's an imac and then two
33:21 - external monitors
33:23 - the most i've ever used is four monitors
33:25 - that was a really cool setup i'd like to
33:27 - go back to that eventually
33:33 - and it says i look younger without the
33:34 - beard yeah i definitely everybody keeps
33:37 - saying that that i look younger and you
33:39 - probably can't see it on the live stream
33:41 - but i have gray hair in my beard so i
33:44 - definitely look younger because i don't
33:46 - i don't yet have any gray hair like on
33:48 - the top of my head
33:51 - so uh yeah definitely younger
33:55 - solely says shout out from south africa
33:58 - thanks for watching
33:59 - uh thanks for the shout out
34:03 - john says uh it is usually a good idea
34:05 - to draw out a plan what divs hold what
34:08 - headings and some sense of functional ui
34:10 - ux
34:11 - yeah for sure uh normally i'm like right
34:14 - now we're kind of stuck with this markup
34:16 - so normally i wouldn't start like this
34:18 - but
34:20 - many of you if you're actually going to
34:21 - work will probably find yourself in a
34:23 - situation where you don't have control
34:25 - over the markup
34:27 - but you need to style it as best you can
34:30 - and what we're doing now is kind of a
34:33 - good example of how you handle that
34:36 - uh
34:38 - how memory says pure css no bootstrap
34:40 - yep no no bootstrap or nothing
34:44 - yeah we so
34:46 - on the components themselves we have
34:47 - styles from material ui but what we're
34:50 - when we're doing this
34:54 - in terms of like styling the markup
34:55 - that's been imported from the other cms
34:58 - it's it's pretty much all from scratch
35:05 - uh how many asked what material ui is uh
35:08 - it's a um
35:09 - a ui framework for react
35:13 - that uses uh material design principles
35:27 - the lone wolf says can anyone explain
35:28 - what br and link does
35:31 - the br tags are html tags that are
35:35 - supposed to include a line break and
35:37 - potentially like some space in between
35:40 - lines
35:41 - but
35:42 - really it's better to use css for that
35:44 - like margins padding and things like
35:46 - that so
35:47 - uh i
35:49 - very rarely use a break tag
35:52 - uh
35:53 - you know now it
35:54 - correct me if i'm wrong but those were
35:56 - kind of really an older thing
35:59 - that you just you don't really do that
36:01 - much anymore
36:03 - and then the link tag
36:06 - i don't know what they're doing with the
36:07 - link tag in here in terms of what got
36:09 - imported from the old cms but link tags
36:12 - are supposed to be to pull in css files
36:16 - uh
36:17 - saatvik says what does the left tag do
36:19 - it really doesn't do anything right now
36:21 - until we assign it some sort of styles
36:24 - it was a custom tag that did have some
36:26 - meaning in the old content management
36:28 - system but doesn't currently
36:31 - in a new system
36:35 - uh javier says is this a semantic html
36:38 - horrible on purpose
36:42 - i don't know what the designers of that
36:44 - old cms were thinking if they wanted it
36:46 - to be like that on purpose or not
36:49 - uh
36:50 - i don't think i'll ever get a chance to
36:52 - ask him so we may never know all right
36:54 - so my timer went off i'm going to go
36:56 - back and
36:57 - start another pomodoro session and then
36:59 - i'm going to come back to the chat and
37:01 - keep going from where i left off
37:04 - which is
37:06 - i don't think i have a pen or anything
37:08 - here
37:09 - all right so
37:10 - the timestamp for me for where i left
37:13 - off is 2 45 p.m in the chat so
37:16 - let's try to remember 2 45 p.m
37:19 - i bet i can just write it here yeah
37:23 - let's just
37:31 - all right so in my terminal i write 245
37:35 - to remember that that's there
37:38 - and then i'll remember where to go okay
37:39 - so we've got our h2s with the class of
37:43 - title style
37:44 - and we've gotten rid of those
37:47 - those break tags well i i shouldn't say
37:49 - we got rid of them they're still there
37:50 - we're just not displaying them
37:58 - okay so now here's what we have
38:02 - we definitely need to style these
38:05 - and these right we
38:07 - if we're going with a hierarchy here
38:10 - uh it's not
38:12 - it's not looking good so far
38:14 - so our left title and right title are
38:17 - going to get the same styles in terms of
38:19 - font and color
38:21 - so let's test out
38:23 - what we think will look good
38:27 - uh
38:28 - so we'll go with a font size of
38:33 - let's say
38:34 - 20
38:38 - all right 20 pixels a little bit bigger
38:41 - and
38:42 - do we want a different font weight
38:49 - let's see what we want so the last one
38:51 - was what 500 let's try a 400 font weight
38:54 - which is going to be pretty light
38:57 - okay not bad and then let's take that
39:00 - color
39:02 - we want that same
39:04 - color
39:06 - of r
39:08 - g
39:09 - r g b a
39:12 - so
39:13 - this rgba that i'm putting in here
39:17 - if we just did the zero zero zero that
39:20 - would give us pure black
39:22 - but instead we're doing this 0.87
39:26 - all right and that that last one is like
39:29 - the the opacity
39:32 - so
39:33 - what we're doing
39:36 - is essentially making a grayish color
39:39 - but we're not putting a gray hex value
39:41 - in
39:42 - text is actually more readable if you do
39:45 - solid black
39:47 - and you make it a little bit transparent
39:50 - to get your gray if you do a gray hex
39:52 - value
39:53 - it's less readable so i'm not going to
39:54 - do it right now like to demonstrate but
39:58 - you know try it out on your own and try
40:00 - them side by side
40:01 - you'll be amazed at the difference
40:05 - okay
40:06 - so that's not bad it still looks weird
40:07 - because we haven't styled these yet but
40:09 - you know i think we're on the right
40:11 - track so let's copy this
40:14 - and we'll go over to our our file here
40:18 - and
40:22 - let's do left
40:25 - what was that left title yeah left title
40:30 - and
40:31 - we're gonna do
40:32 - um right
40:35 - title
40:38 - so since we put this comma in here
40:41 - it's going to add the same styles
40:46 - for both of these
40:49 - so let's save that
40:51 - just to make sure that styles are
40:53 - applying across the board
41:00 - there we are okay so we have the same
41:02 - styles all the way down good
41:04 - now let's see what we're working with
41:07 - for for these
41:09 - each one of these
41:11 - all right
41:13 - oh goodness
41:14 - um
41:16 - all right this is not too bad so we want
41:18 - to target all h2s that have a class of
41:21 - title that live within a left tag or a
41:24 - right tag
41:26 - so uh we can we can definitely do that
41:29 - so let's
41:32 - let's do this over here it's going to be
41:34 - a little
41:37 - tricky to do it in dev tools
41:40 - not not impossible but
41:42 - let's just do it over here so let's do a
41:44 - left tag
41:45 - and let's say h2
41:48 - title
41:50 - and then let's do a write tag
41:52 - and then we'll say h2
41:54 - title
41:56 - so this
41:57 - will target what we wanted to target we
41:59 - could hover over that so any h2s with a
42:01 - class of title that are within a left
42:04 - tag or
42:06 - a right tag
42:07 - and that's what we're going to go with
42:09 - here and let's
42:11 - based on what we've seen with the other
42:13 - things we styled we can pretty much
42:15 - guess without even looking what's going
42:17 - to work so let's do a font size
42:20 - of 18 pixels
42:24 - and we'll do a font
42:29 - weight
42:31 - and we're going to keep it at that 400
42:34 - pixels if you start to go below below
42:36 - 400
42:38 - it gets a little bit difficult to read
42:41 - if you have a nice screen
42:43 - it's okay and it actually looks really
42:45 - good
42:46 - but for users that have older screens
42:48 - it's
42:49 - it's very hard to to read so
42:53 - although aesthetically i really like how
42:55 - it looks
42:56 - i mean from
42:58 - just out of respect for a lot of the
43:00 - users that may not have
43:01 - you know high definition screens
43:04 - i'm not i'm going to very rarely go
43:06 - below 400 unless we're talking about
43:09 - large font
43:10 - sizes and so finally uh we're going to
43:14 - make the color
43:16 - let's just copy and paste so we don't
43:18 - have to type that out again but i want
43:20 - to try it with
43:22 - a lighter gray color
43:24 - because we need
43:26 - i think we need some differentiation
43:28 - here
43:29 - because we have a lot of
43:31 - levels going on so let's try 54.
43:35 - usually the values i end up using are
43:37 - either 87 or 54. never pure black
43:40 - um
43:42 - and this will give us a lighter gray
43:44 - color that'll still be readable
43:47 - so
43:48 - let me refresh i do have like auto auto
43:51 - refresh set up here but since the
43:55 - uh there's a bit of lag here it's kind
43:57 - of running a little slow from the live
43:59 - stream i just
44:00 - keep doing this you know manually
44:03 - okay
44:06 - so let me zoom in here it's easy to see
44:08 - so right now
44:11 - we do have
44:16 - this font weight looks a little big
44:21 - left h2 title that's interesting why
44:25 - is this
44:33 - did i mess it up
44:35 - oops i put pixels in the font weight
44:38 - uh i'm sure some of you already caught
44:40 - that and put it in the uh in the live
44:42 - chat so sorry if i didn't glance over
44:44 - there but yeah that's
44:47 - can't put pixels in the font weight it's
44:49 - just a regular
44:51 - you know number
44:52 - okay
44:53 - that that looks nicer so this what we
44:56 - have right now uh not too bad
44:59 - well we forgot to style
45:02 - this
45:03 - i'm not that worried about styling that
45:05 - so i'm going to leave that alone for now
45:07 - and let's see so we'll come to the page
45:11 - i just kind of wanted like zoom out and
45:12 - just see
45:13 - the the big picture here so we come to
45:15 - the page we see the mission aims
45:19 - okay and now we go down sample program
45:22 - classics first year first semester
45:25 - second semesters
45:32 - okay
45:34 - it's it's a bit much
45:37 - it is a bit much you know what i wonder
45:40 - let's shrink this down and see what it
45:42 - would look like on a small screen like
45:44 - on a phone
45:46 - uh
45:47 - let's see
45:50 - it's not too bad i think there needs to
45:52 - be uh some some work with the padding
45:56 - and the margins here so we need you know
45:58 - better spacing so it doesn't all run
46:01 - together
46:03 - and i think we don't need
46:05 - links for each one of these so
46:08 - for this
46:10 - oh
46:14 - so for this one
46:15 - it has it here because this whole thing
46:18 - changes
46:20 - when you click it so that's why it keeps
46:22 - repeating that link
46:24 - so we don't need to do that i do want to
46:26 - see what what happens when this goes
46:28 - small
46:31 - okay interesting
46:37 - all right so it it it doesn't display
46:39 - them all
46:41 - but it still has this kind of
46:44 - uh stacked look within each one
46:47 - okay
46:53 - all right not
46:54 - it's not terrible
46:57 - i don't think we're gonna get into doing
46:59 - anything like this
47:02 - right now
47:04 - but i'm gonna keep that open as kind of
47:06 - a possibility here
47:13 - okay
47:15 - all right so let's go back to what we
47:16 - have here
47:18 - and
47:28 - all right let's see where this
47:34 - oops
47:39 - where this is
47:40 - let's inspect that
47:42 - and
47:43 - okay view all
47:44 - so this is within a view all tag
47:48 - and
47:56 - classics classes text
48:04 - that's really weird i don't want it to
48:05 - say that um
48:07 - i don't know why it says that
48:12 - okay so let's take
48:15 - these view all tags
48:21 - and
48:31 - which one are we going to
48:38 - i wonder if we could
48:46 - all right let me let me just get over
48:47 - what i'm kind of thinking now
48:49 - uh so i'm thinking
48:53 - we definitely don't need
48:56 - the same link four times on the page
49:00 - we really just need it one time
49:05 - oh
49:06 - excuse me
49:09 - we need to link one time and my thought
49:11 - was okay well let me hide all of them
49:13 - except for
49:14 - one but i also had a thought that you
49:18 - know the
49:19 - the url for this is going to be pretty
49:22 - predictable it's just going to be
49:26 - classics and classes so potentially we
49:29 - could just put into our
49:32 - indoor component
49:35 - another element there in our component
49:38 - to display it and it can just
49:40 - add in
49:43 - are our slug right for that particular
49:46 - uh page
49:48 - into here
49:50 - and just build the url like that the
49:52 - benefit of doing it that way is that we
49:54 - can use link prefetching
49:57 - so right now this is built in so if i
50:00 - click this we're going to get a page
50:02 - refresh so let's let's see
50:04 - see we get a page refresh
50:09 - which obviously takes longer
50:15 - so we don't really want that
50:19 - yeah so let's do it let's do it like
50:21 - that so
50:23 - first things first let's
50:25 - take view all
50:27 - and we're going to say
50:30 - let's just put it right here with this
50:32 - br
50:39 - all right so view all is gonna be
50:41 - display none
50:43 - and then
50:44 - we'll just put in and that's also gonna
50:47 - solve the problem of the uh the text
50:50 - here
50:51 - being weird like classics classes text
50:53 - doesn't really say to the user what's
50:55 - going to be on that page
51:03 - so i guess i'll have to refresh
51:06 - my auto refresh is just not happening
51:09 - all right there we go so we've gotten
51:11 - rid of that
51:14 - and just to add this in
51:19 - i guess we could add this in quickly let
51:20 - me see how much time i have 10 minutes
51:22 - okay
51:23 - that's enough time we can go back to our
51:25 - major.js
51:28 - and we could see what we're going to get
51:30 - is
51:31 - the id
51:32 - our id i believe is what we're going to
51:34 - want
51:36 - and that would be classics right
51:45 - all right so let's go down here
51:53 - our query
51:54 - is bringing in all this data
52:01 - so after that
52:07 - yeah we can put our
52:09 - other element after that
52:11 - so
52:14 - let's just add a link tag
52:16 - and make sure we've imported our link
52:18 - tag
52:20 - and we have not
52:26 - maybe we can just copy and paste it from
52:29 - an existing component
52:31 - so i know we have
52:37 - the
52:38 - drawer item.js is doing this
52:41 - so
52:45 - we're gonna import link from next link
52:47 - so this part here is getting a little
52:49 - bit more advanced uh we're using react
52:52 - so if you're not familiar with this uh
52:54 - don't worry about it this is definitely
52:56 - not css stuff
52:58 - but i'm just gonna copy and paste a few
53:00 - things
53:01 - just to save time and then we're gonna
53:03 - get back to our css
53:06 - so let's get our link
53:21 - okay
53:23 - and
53:26 - link
53:28 - there we go so
53:36 - all right this will get auto formatted i
53:38 - know it looks weird now but we don't
53:40 - need a key
53:43 - for this
53:45 - oops
53:47 - and
53:48 - we can put
53:51 - no we're going to put that in manually
53:53 - yeah let's do um
53:57 - so this is going to be
54:01 - uh
54:02 - template literal
54:04 - so
54:06 - template literal is when you want to put
54:08 - in a string but you want to also have
54:10 - some javascript in there as well it
54:12 - makes it a lot easier than having to do
54:14 - a normal string and then concatenate uh
54:18 - that together with plus signs
54:20 - with some some javascript
54:24 - so what we want to do is just put um
54:29 - oops
54:30 - let's do
54:31 - [Music]
54:32 - this first part is going to be our
54:37 - our id so this
54:39 - props
54:41 - id actually did we deconstruct
54:48 - yeah this props id okay
54:51 - uh so we have this props id and i forgot
54:55 - i forgot this
54:57 - so when we want to use javascript we put
54:59 - a dollar sign and some curly brackets
55:02 - and then after the next curly bracket we
55:04 - drop right back into stringland and we
55:06 - can just put the string which is
55:09 - which is classes
55:11 - all right so
55:14 - that's what works here
55:16 - uh and let's see
55:21 - let's look over here i'm glad we have
55:23 - this open
55:24 - uh so we did have some weirdness going
55:27 - on where
55:29 - uh we needed
55:31 - we needed to add some things and as page
55:34 - type academics and pages
55:37 - let's
55:38 - let's pull this in
55:41 - just to see
55:49 - okay so
55:52 - are we pulling this in
55:53 - [Music]
55:54 - pulling this in his page
55:58 - is it really paige are we doing this as
56:05 - i
56:06 - think we're doing these classes as a
56:08 - major
56:11 - type
56:20 - nope it's
56:32 - no
56:34 - major
56:36 - id
56:39 - classes
56:41 - uh id is gonna be
56:49 - this props id
56:52 - oops
56:53 - and then
56:55 - hyphen
56:58 - let's change this to template
57:01 - literal
57:03 - syntax
57:08 - oops
57:13 - i'm gonna explain what i'm doing here in
57:14 - just a second
57:16 - and hope that it works uh it's just
57:19 - gonna be
57:25 - course descriptions
57:36 - all right let's save
57:38 - that okay so
57:41 - assuming this is gonna work which i'm
57:43 - assuming here is that uh we're adding in
57:46 - uh the url
57:49 - that'll be seen in the in the browser
57:50 - but we're also adding in this
57:52 - as and this is going to send some data
57:56 - to our
57:59 - um
58:00 - to our router
58:02 - and enable this link to act as
58:04 - client-side routing
58:07 - so
58:09 - that's why we're we're kind of doing
58:10 - this uh if you want to know why we do it
58:13 - like this check out
58:15 - show me what
58:18 - issue or pull request
58:23 - you know what if anybody's interested in
58:25 - the why let me know in the live chat and
58:26 - i will take the time to look up where
58:29 - the you can get more info about this in
58:31 - the repository
58:32 - uh otherwise if nobody's really
58:34 - interested then
58:35 - i'm not going to look it up right now
58:37 - but let's let's see if this even works
58:48 - there we go course descriptions
59:13 - yeah not working
59:17 - i did the wrong thing
59:45 - maybe i should check the server to see
59:47 - if i'm using uh the correct
59:53 - correct words here so
60:00 - majors all right
60:02 - this could be a problem
60:08 - majors
60:13 - all right let's see if that makes a
60:15 - difference
60:25 - uh you know what i flipped them around
60:28 - that's what i was worried about okay so
60:30 - the as url needs to go is the href
60:34 - all right
60:34 - let's switch it
60:37 - i messed it up
60:40 - makes a lot more sense now all right so
60:43 - this needs to be as
60:45 - and this needs to be ahref
60:51 - all right
61:02 - okay now
61:06 - let me refresh make sure
61:08 - this actually went through
61:10 - so it shouldn't
61:15 - so what was happening is it was showing
61:17 - us all those parameters when we hovered
61:19 - over and that's not what it should show
61:21 - us it just shows something that looks
61:22 - like a normal url
61:26 - all right so this now is
61:29 - looking like a normal url
61:34 - and so i'm going to click this and see
61:36 - what happens yeah there we go all right
61:38 - so i don't know if you caught that but
61:41 - what happened was
61:42 - uh hopefully if you saw the last time we
61:44 - tried to load this page it took a while
61:48 - now it was very fast
61:51 - because we never refreshed the page it
61:52 - routed client-side so that's what we
61:54 - wanted to happen
61:56 - let's go back and click it one more time
61:58 - just to see
62:00 - very fast
62:01 - so it's using
62:03 - client-side routing it's using
62:05 - pre-fetching caching so this is going to
62:07 - make the speed just that much faster
62:11 - and
62:12 - because we did it like this
62:16 - where we we put in variables instead of
62:18 - hard-coding this this will now work
62:22 - for every
62:24 - major page
62:27 - so they'll all have this here
62:29 - uh now part of the problem let me see
62:32 - this
62:33 - is the
62:34 - we're gonna have
62:36 - this now at the bottom of here
62:38 - so we'll have to think about what we
62:39 - want to do with that you know maybe we
62:42 - don't have uh
62:44 - these type of things appear on a major
62:47 - page so
62:48 - we'll have to work that out
62:51 - but
62:52 - for now i
62:54 - it looks a lot better so
62:57 - this
63:00 - this is just such a huge improvement
63:02 - over what was there when we started
63:03 - remember we had these huge
63:06 - font sizes and font weights
63:09 - and the spacing was really weird
63:12 - so this is not perfect and it's not
63:15 - really how i want it to be ideally but
63:18 - let's say we ran out of time and didn't
63:20 - get to do anything else with this
63:22 - this is still readable
63:25 - it makes some kind of sense visually
63:28 - so
63:30 - that's
63:31 - i'm okay with that for
63:34 - you know for what it is for right now
63:38 - all right awesome so my timer went off
63:41 - and now for the rest of the stream
63:45 - i'm gonna do questions uh although i
63:47 - probably should commit this so that you
63:50 - all can see all the code i gotta
63:51 - remember 245 is where i left off
63:56 - so let's do a git status
63:59 - if you're not familiar with git this
64:01 - will be like a really really tiny uh
64:03 - basic tutorial so when we use git status
64:07 - is the command in our terminal
64:09 - it shows us that
64:11 - we've modified the major.js
64:14 - file and then we've added a major.css
64:17 - file that's exactly what we worked on so
64:19 - that's that's what i expected to see so
64:21 - that's good
64:23 - let's we need to add these files to the
64:25 - staging area now so we're going to do a
64:27 - git add and i want to add all the files
64:29 - so i'm just going to put a period there
64:32 - hit enter now if we do a git status
64:35 - you can see
64:37 - these are green now they're in the this
64:39 - they're staged right so they're ready to
64:42 - be committed
64:45 - and i'm gonna use this command called
64:46 - yarn cm this does not come with git by
64:48 - default this was in addition just to
64:50 - help us make uh nice commit messages so
64:54 - let's say uh we're gonna add a new
64:57 - feature
64:58 - and
64:59 - uh
65:00 - we're just gonna write a very short
65:01 - statement explaining what we did
65:04 - and we'll just say add
65:07 - styles for
65:09 - uh
65:10 - course for sample
65:16 - sample schedules
65:23 - sample class schedules so you want it to
65:26 - be short but descriptive enough that
65:28 - you'll be able or someone else will be
65:29 - able to go back and read it and say okay
65:32 - i know what that's about
65:35 - so think like one sentence
65:39 - sample class schedules great there we
65:41 - are and
65:44 - are there breaking changes no
65:47 - does it affect any open issues i believe
65:49 - it does
65:50 - let me see
65:52 - i don't think i have that open
65:54 - i do yes
65:56 - let's check out the issues here
65:58 - style sample program sections so that's
66:01 - issue 102.
66:05 - so let's uh say that yes it does affect
66:09 - an open issue
66:10 - and let's say it affects issue
66:14 - uh number 102.
66:19 - now it's going to run
66:22 - some tests
66:24 - and i actually uh i changed one thing in
66:26 - the repository and for those of you who
66:28 - are contributing this should help you
66:30 - out
66:31 - a long time ago just kind of for
66:33 - demonstration purposes i had set the
66:37 - end-to-end testing
66:38 - to
66:39 - not use the headless version of chrome
66:41 - browser so it actually popped up with a
66:43 - browser and you could see it going
66:44 - through the pages and then
66:48 - that was taking longer
66:50 - than it needed to so i went back and i
66:53 - set that to actually use the headless
66:55 - version and it cut the times about in
66:57 - half
66:59 - so if you had a slower computer your end
67:02 - end test might be timing out
67:04 - as they time out after 30 seconds i
67:06 - think so
67:08 - it should be better now if you download
67:11 - the latest changes
67:13 - uh i just committed them
67:15 - right before the stream started
67:18 - so hopefully that will help with with
67:20 - the time
67:22 - so sorry about that i just
67:25 - i didn't realize that
67:28 - i never switched it back
67:31 - which i should have because i could see
67:32 - it happening every time
67:34 - all right so let me go back while that's
67:36 - doing its thing
67:38 - i'm going to scroll back up to is that
67:40 - the timestamp 245
67:44 - and
67:45 - i'm going to answer as many questions as
67:47 - i can here
67:50 - i should be what time is it i should be
67:52 - able to get to all the questions
68:05 - let's see
68:11 - uh
68:12 - hermene says so we'll not modify the
68:14 - html at all uh no not if we can help it
68:23 - uh i'm not opposed to using javascript
68:25 - though to modify it uh so just like we
68:28 - did when we added in that that extra
68:31 - link tag
68:32 - if we do it in a way that could be used
68:35 - across the board on all components i'm
68:37 - okay with that
68:38 - alright so everything passed
68:40 - and
68:42 - now we can
68:44 - do a get push
68:47 - origin and that'll push all our changes
68:50 - right up to our master branch so
68:52 - if you want to check out what we've done
68:55 - you can see it now
68:57 - in our github repo
68:59 - everything is up to date
69:11 - all right so i am skipping over some of
69:13 - the questions because they were answered
69:14 - right away uh by other people in the
69:17 - chat so uh thank you uh for for
69:21 - answering so many questions you are
69:22 - being really helpful when and answering
69:24 - each other's questions
69:32 - well it is
69:33 - you know we did have a lot more people
69:35 - than normal today i don't know what it
69:36 - was uh for anybody who may be here
69:39 - that's not normally here
69:41 - uh could you let me know uh how did you
69:43 - hear about the stream and and what made
69:45 - you decide to watch it today i'm just
69:49 - i have no idea what's different today
69:52 - i mean i haven't checked any messages
69:54 - maybe i got retweeted by somebody with a
69:56 - lot of followers
69:58 - it doesn't even look like that though
70:00 - all right yeah so i'm not really sure
70:08 - uh yeah okay so him emmy is one of the
70:10 - new ones
70:11 - cool thanks for watching
70:16 - so i just heard one of my kids in the
70:17 - background
70:20 - all right he's talking to uh
70:22 - to my wife
70:26 - all right i missed it har [ __ ] had said
70:28 - uh he was gonna go to sleep so uh if you
70:31 - watch the end of this harsha thank you
70:32 - so much for all your help here and in
70:34 - the live chat answering questions and uh
70:36 - thank you for staying up so late in
70:38 - harsh it's time zone it's it's well
70:40 - after midnight um so
70:45 - what is it might be like
70:47 - yeah it's really late it's like the
70:49 - middle of the night
70:59 - i need to get some better lighting
71:01 - see my
71:03 - it's really dark in here all right
71:08 - uh lone wolf says i'm just done through
71:11 - css html bootstrap and the front end
71:13 - course is that enough for me to
71:15 - comprehend all of this
71:16 - um you could probably comprehend all the
71:19 - like the css stuff
71:21 - if you're not familiar with react it may
71:23 - be a little bit more difficult to get
71:25 - what's going on there
71:27 - but
71:29 - i try to do uh his best the best job
71:32 - that i can with explaining things along
71:33 - the way and you can ask you know feel
71:36 - free to ask questions so i'd say give it
71:38 - a shot uh if you find that it's really
71:40 - difficult to follow along then
71:42 - you know hey maybe maybe this stream at
71:44 - this point is not for you but i i do try
71:47 - to do a mix of things that are you know
71:49 - different
71:50 - types of things
71:52 - uh different levels so
71:54 - you know some of them might be good you
71:56 - know for you where you're at right now
71:58 - some of them you know maybe not
72:08 - oh yeah you know what phoenix has a good
72:10 - point
72:11 - um
72:12 - the uh the main benefit i could see to
72:15 - this stream is
72:17 - seeing what it's like for a front-end
72:19 - developer
72:20 - to actually work through issues on a
72:23 - project have things break
72:26 - uh problems come up and you know try to
72:29 - try to just work through it and fix it
72:32 - also the ability to ask questions with
72:34 - so many you know really knowledgeable
72:36 - developers here in the live chat
72:39 - is is good as well
72:41 - um so
72:43 - in the sense of this being like a
72:44 - tutorial for
72:46 - let's say react or anything
72:48 - it's not really that uh but it it can
72:51 - give some
72:53 - i
72:54 - i mean i think it gets some good
72:55 - experiences to you know what do you do
72:57 - when things don't work
72:58 - uh when you have deadlines you know what
73:01 - and you can't get everything done like
73:03 - what do you do how do you handle that
73:05 - um
73:06 - and i try to explain what happens like
73:09 - you know if i have a meeting and
73:10 - somebody wants something changed uh or i
73:13 - disagree with the change but we still
73:14 - have to do it you know things like that
73:16 - that you don't really get in any
73:18 - tutorials or online courses but you deal
73:21 - with
73:22 - you know in in the real world in jobs
73:25 - so we talk about stuff like that so i
73:27 - think that's really
73:29 - even if you don't necessarily understand
73:30 - the coding part of it
73:32 - you know things like that anybody can
73:34 - understand
73:44 - lone wolf asks where do i learn react or
73:46 - angular uh there's a lot of pl so the
73:48 - react documentation itself is really
73:51 - good uh udacity has a react course it's
73:54 - a paid course though i went i did the
73:56 - react nano degree through udacity and i
73:58 - i thought it was valuable uh but you
74:00 - don't have to spend money there's a lot
74:02 - of you know free react courses out there
74:05 - um i think
74:07 - i don't know i know some of you have
74:09 - used some react stuff so if you can
74:10 - think of any good react courses put in
74:12 - the live chat now please uh what else
74:14 - have i used
74:16 - i think codecademy has
74:18 - a react course
74:21 - so
74:21 - you know between some you know youtube
74:23 - videos and some of the documentation and
74:26 - the free courses out there you can
74:29 - you can get some good experience with
74:30 - react i am not as familiar with angular
74:33 - though so i can't help you you know
74:35 - quite as much there
74:37 - in terms of what
74:39 - where good resources are
74:47 - okay john says when you have no
74:48 - container for your markup you can use
74:50 - grid
74:51 - flex will work a bit but not easily all
74:53 - right you know what john i kind of wish
74:55 - i had seen that earlier but
74:57 - all right i'm i'm going to keep that in
74:58 - mind though and then maybe you know
75:00 - we'll try to use grid
75:02 - to um
75:04 - to display those and at least on desktop
75:07 - we can display them in in two columns
75:10 - instead of just one column
75:22 - um
75:23 - solely says
75:25 - uh which cms produced this markup uh
75:28 - it's an old uh dot-net framework based
75:32 - cms called ektron so it's e-k-t-r-o-n
75:38 - so i
75:39 - i almost never come across someone who
75:42 - even has heard of it i never heard of it
75:45 - until i got this job so
75:47 - uh it's
75:49 - i i think it's rare
76:03 - oh meyer says
76:05 - grid does require a parent component
76:07 - holding the children in his case he has
76:09 - none i believe
76:11 - yeah that's true we don't have any um
76:16 - john says it's easy enough to wrap the
76:17 - component in a grid div
76:20 - i
76:22 - yeah you know what maybe the solution is
76:24 - going to be that we may have to add some
76:26 - things
76:28 - with javascript off to see if that's
76:30 - going to be possible
76:40 - uh
76:41 - solely said the the current content is
76:43 - over 500 page in wordpress but it was
76:45 - brought over from an older cms that's
76:47 - correct and it's actually more than 500
76:49 - pages it's uh
76:52 - i haven't really counted but
76:56 - i mean potentially like if
76:59 - we're looking at over a
77:00 - thousand uh so it's it's quite a lot
77:04 - i'm trying to condense it
77:06 - as much as i can and clean up the data i
77:09 - think there's there's a lot that
77:11 - does not need to be split out into
77:13 - different you know pages or posts in
77:15 - wordpress and there's some stuff that we
77:17 - can just completely delete
77:19 - uh so we'll see what the count is once i
77:21 - get it all cleaned up but as of right
77:23 - now we're looking at over a thousand
77:26 - things i don't even have all the data
77:28 - uh transferred over yet
77:34 - uh meyer says i'm getting noise oh okay
77:37 - i'm i'm sorry i didn't see that earlier
77:39 - uh let me know if it's if anybody else
77:41 - was getting noise if you're still
77:43 - getting any noise
77:47 - um let's see if you have questions help
77:49 - me please what javascript framework for
77:51 - css animation is the best or vanilla js
77:54 - is the best way
77:56 - um green sock
77:58 - a lot of people use something called
78:00 - green sock for um for animation or for
78:03 - javascript animation
78:05 - um trying for css animation
78:10 - i'm not sure i mean if you want to mix
78:12 - javascript in as well go try out green
78:14 - suck i'm not sure about a css animation
78:17 - framework though
78:21 - uh lone wolf says any suggestions about
78:23 - how many hours i should dedicate to the
78:25 - free code camp front end course per day
78:28 - uh honestly i would if you can spend an
78:30 - hour a day at it i think that's good as
78:32 - long as you can be consistent
78:34 - uh
78:35 - i mean like it depends on what you're
78:37 - doing like right now if you have another
78:40 - job
78:41 - shoot for an hour a day if you can
78:43 - if you don't have another job and you
78:44 - can dedicate more time to it then you
78:47 - know try to dedicate more time but if
78:49 - you could do an hour a half hour every
78:52 - day that'll keep it in your mind every
78:54 - day and you'll be much more likely to uh
78:57 - to retain the information that that you
78:59 - learn
79:02 - uh flo vest says my raspberry pi arrives
79:05 - in two days any ideas what what i could
79:08 - do with it
79:09 - okay if anyone has any ideas about what
79:11 - to do with a raspberry pi put it in the
79:14 - in the chat please or if you're watching
79:16 - later on you can put it in the comments
79:20 - um
79:20 - yeah
79:22 - you can do one of those smart mirrors
79:24 - with the raspberry pi right
79:27 - i've always wanted to do one of those
79:29 - those look really cool
79:31 - but i guess there's
79:32 - there's so much stuff i
79:34 - that i've seen people do that really
79:36 - cool i guess it
79:38 - kind of depends on
79:40 - how much work you want to do how much
79:41 - money you want to put into it
79:54 - uh solely says which extension adds that
79:57 - tool tip for the h2 title
80:00 - i actually have no idea what extension
80:01 - that is i was surprised when it showed
80:04 - up that's the first time i had ever used
80:05 - it
80:06 - uh let's see
80:08 - let's see what it is
80:10 - let's see if we can see
80:16 - let's check my extensions
80:24 - maybe we might be able to tell just by
80:26 - the titles of the extensions
80:32 - okay
80:33 - uh
80:34 - css to react
80:43 - i'm guessing not
80:45 - only island
80:57 - hmm
81:00 - okay it's not really obvious just for my
81:03 - the names of my extensions what
81:06 - what does that so
81:08 - i'm not sure i don't really want to take
81:10 - the time to go through all of them but
81:12 - i'll leave this on the screen so at
81:14 - least you can see some of the extensions
81:15 - i'm using and try them out
81:27 - so i'm listening to spotify in the
81:28 - background and right now uh a song came
81:32 - on and it's ed sheeran doing a cover of
81:35 - uh britney spears um
81:38 - uh hit me baby one more time
81:42 - it was just so weird to hear that
81:45 - uh
81:46 - all right then
81:54 - um
81:57 - bargov says i'm a beginner i don't know
81:59 - anything but i have a craze about
82:01 - programming please help me to learn
82:03 - uh
82:04 - yeah i mean
82:07 - just stick around the streams and ask a
82:09 - lot of questions
82:11 - if you have any specific questions let
82:13 - me know
82:14 - i'm happy to help and there's a lot of
82:15 - other people here that are you know very
82:17 - helpful
82:20 - lone wolf asked if there's any
82:21 - implementation of jquery here no in this
82:23 - project we're not using any jquery
82:41 - uh
82:44 - bargov says how can i learn this
82:45 - programming
82:47 - um i mean we did a lot of css today so i
82:49 - mean just you do basic css tutorials um
82:53 - phoenix says start free code camp yet
82:55 - actually that's a great place to start
82:57 - go to freecodecamp.org
83:00 - and you know sign up and just do some of
83:02 - the exercises
83:04 - that will get you started you know
83:05 - you'll start out
83:07 - you know with some really basic stuff
83:08 - and work your way up in in difficulty
83:10 - and complexity
83:11 - and
83:13 - that'll give you a really good idea too
83:15 - of uh if this is for you if you know if
83:17 - you really like the work
83:33 - uh vlad
83:34 - asks if there will be training projects
83:36 - on angular
83:37 - i don't plan on doing anything with
83:39 - angular
83:40 - uh for my live streams but we did have
83:43 - um
83:44 - angular video recently
83:48 - on free code camp so if you check back
83:50 - you know through the last maybe
83:52 - just scroll back it's somewhere in the
83:54 - last like 10 videos or so that were
83:56 - released there was one about angular so
83:59 - check that
84:00 - out um
84:04 - i haven't watched it yet
84:07 - but
84:09 - you know that may be a good place to
84:10 - start
84:14 - uh
84:15 - sathvik says which what is good to learn
84:17 - flask i don't really know anything about
84:19 - flask so i wouldn't be able to help help
84:21 - you if anybody knows about flask uh
84:24 - please
84:25 - um
84:26 - let uh
84:27 - saatvik uh know uh here in the uh in the
84:31 - live chat or in the comments of the
84:32 - video
84:34 - uh let's see bargov says why don't you
84:37 - start your own company
84:38 - uh to be honest with you um
84:43 - for my um
84:45 - doing your own company involves a lot of
84:47 - work that's not coding work and i'm just
84:49 - not interested in that work
84:51 - so
84:52 - i don't know if if there was if i had a
84:53 - partner that was interested in all that
84:55 - work meaning like the work of uh doing
84:58 - taxes doing payroll collecting
85:01 - payments from clients
85:03 - uh marketing the company if there are
85:05 - people that were interested in that and
85:07 - i could just do the code i would be okay
85:09 - with that but i was freelance i had to
85:11 - do all that stuff before
85:14 - i just don't enjoy it i'd rather just
85:17 - spend my time doing coding
85:19 - and let somebody else worry about that
85:22 - so
85:24 - that's one of the reasons why i don't
85:25 - start my own company
85:30 - uh
85:31 - hammy says shout out from tunisia happy
85:34 - to be with you uh awesome
85:37 - awesome thank you
85:39 - i'm glad you're with us too
85:42 - john says i know this is a nudge to
85:43 - installing style components but you can
85:45 - then append all the incoming markup tags
85:48 - with styled
85:49 - uh ie cons style left title equals
85:54 - your css here
85:56 - okay
85:58 - i didn't realize we could do that off
86:00 - maybe we'll have to look into that more
86:05 - uh ash ashwini says need help and
86:08 - documentation
86:09 - uh ashwini i'm not sure if you're asking
86:11 - if i need help with documentation or if
86:14 - you're saying that you need help and
86:16 - documentation so
86:17 - um let me know which is which uh
86:20 - we always need help with everything so
86:22 - if you'd like to
86:25 - uh check out the repository for this
86:27 - project or some of the other projects
86:28 - that we've been knowing
86:30 - uh links in the description
86:32 - and uh submit a pull request working on
86:35 - some of the documentation that would be
86:36 - awesome
86:39 - uh it's definitely it's not expected or
86:41 - required of anyone but it's definitely
86:43 - appreciated
86:46 - uh
86:50 - scrub is says uh how did you set up
86:52 - react on salesforce actually i didn't do
86:55 - when we did stuff with salesforce we
86:57 - didn't set up react with salesforce that
86:59 - would be awesome but i never did it
87:03 - we just use like plain
87:05 - css and javascript
87:15 - uh hamami says isn't it better to use uh
87:18 - rem instead of pixels
87:21 - um yeah meyer says yes it's better uh
87:26 - yeah you know what
87:28 - that's something that keeps coming up as
87:29 - well
87:30 - i just use pixels because in my mind uh
87:34 - i ca i know what size in terms of pixels
87:37 - i need and what will work
87:39 - i
87:40 - i haven't used uh em or rem enough to be
87:43 - able to visualize that yet so that's why
87:45 - i just fall back on pixels
87:47 - so
87:48 - i would really have to make an effort to
87:50 - try to use um rem more
87:55 - uh when i could get to that point so
87:58 - especially for streams when i'm trying
88:00 - to talk and do this at the same time and
88:02 - try to do it quickly
88:04 - i just default back to pixels so
88:08 - um and that's just
88:09 - i started out with pixels and that's you
88:12 - know what i use 90 of the time at least
88:14 - so that's that's just kind of where my
88:16 - my mind is
88:23 - let's see
88:25 - oops it
88:26 - it scrolled me down to the bottom and i
88:28 - lost my place let me scroll back uh
88:31 - uh okay
88:32 - john says i guess i'm shocked that those
88:34 - tags are being accepted as html markup
88:36 - the w3 consortium validator would never
88:38 - pass that yeah
88:40 - i
88:41 - i don't worry about
88:43 - that the validator but i mean they're
88:45 - just
88:46 - it probably just reads it as you know
88:48 - custom elements
88:49 - uh which which are okay
89:03 - uh me says if you want uh jesse tell us
89:06 - about some keyboard shortcuts you use
89:08 - um
89:11 - generally what do i use
89:15 - i don't know what i use that's like
89:17 - beyond just the normal stuff um
89:21 - i mean in the terminal obviously you
89:23 - know you use your up and down arrow keys
89:25 - to go through past commands
89:27 - uh use tab for autocomplete a lot
89:30 - so both in the terminal and you know in
89:33 - my
89:34 - my editor
89:35 - other than that i'm not really
89:38 - it would probably help if i did learn
89:40 - more
89:41 - uh more hotkeys but you know right now i
89:45 - you know just use some really basic ones
89:50 - i wish i used more i wish i had a a
89:52 - cooler answer for that but i just used
89:54 - pro you know basic ones that most people
89:56 - know about
89:59 - uh raul says hi nice to see you back um
90:02 - remember me wish me luck sunday is my
90:04 - entrance
90:05 - my my last chance
90:07 - oh okay well good yeah definitely good
90:09 - luck with that
90:12 - and uh let us know if you can let us
90:15 - know how everything goes you know next
90:17 - next week
90:22 - okay so uh ro sharma says
90:26 - i was going through youtube and the
90:28 - title got me okay cool so the title
90:30 - uh so i guess a lot of people
90:34 - you know maybe maybe it was the title of
90:36 - basic css that you know people responded
90:39 - to
90:46 - uh eddie says are you still in school or
90:48 - are you working for a company
90:50 - um
90:51 - yeah so i'm i'm working for uh for a
90:54 - university so i'm a full-time front-end
90:56 - developer uh working for a company
91:00 - uh slowly says i'm i'm new but since i
91:02 - follow free code camp i got a
91:04 - notification from youtube that there
91:05 - will be a basic css styling live stream
91:08 - never done react though but i think i
91:09 - will go back and do it okay cool yeah
91:12 - yeah i didn't really want this to be
91:14 - like about react i wanted to try to
91:15 - stick to the css as much as possible but
91:18 - we ended up having to do a little react
91:19 - stuff at the end
91:21 - uh but you know hopefully it was there
91:23 - was enough css in there
91:26 - that it was maybe useful to some people
91:30 - uh
91:31 - chat play says i subscribe to this
91:33 - channel since i don't know react well i
91:36 - watch recorded episodes from project one
91:37 - okay cool
91:39 - cool
91:41 - uh how many just activated notifications
91:43 - on your channel i'm currently doing the
91:44 - free code camp algorithms flowvest the
91:47 - same
91:53 - cool
91:58 - there was a github link
92:00 - today
92:02 - uh darshan asked where the github link
92:04 - is for the code we developed today it
92:06 - should be in the description to this
92:07 - video so there should be a link to the
92:09 - github repo
92:12 - says is there a standard free code camp
92:14 - link or is the same as airbnb repo that
92:18 - yesterday you posted uh enzyme and just
92:20 - stuff on
92:24 - yeah it should be
92:26 - the link should be in the description so
92:28 - it'll be like uh fus dash marcom slash
92:32 - franciscan uh hyphen reacts
92:36 - uh that'll be the
92:38 - that'll be part of the link it'll be a
92:39 - github link and that'll be the end of it
92:54 - hard knock muscle says if you started
92:56 - your own company what would it be
92:58 - um
93:00 - i guess
93:02 - it would be cool to have a company like
93:03 - based around like a product like let's
93:06 - say
93:07 - i don't know i had a good idea and
93:09 - you could just dedicate time to that
93:13 - i mean i don't know what it would be but
93:15 - you know some sort of web-based
93:18 - you know service or something
93:20 - otherwise
93:21 - you know maybe some sort of agency
93:24 - uh that we did work for i just
93:29 - i don't know i don't know how i really
93:31 - feel about
93:32 - about an agency
93:35 - i've done some work with agencies before
93:37 - and i
93:38 - there there's good and bad to it right i
93:40 - mean it's kind of cool that you get to
93:41 - work on different things
93:45 - uh but
93:48 - yeah i don't know i mean you're always
93:50 - having to look for new clients and so
93:52 - there's not a lot of
93:54 - stability necessarily
93:56 - um
93:58 - yeah so
94:01 - i don't know i'm not really sure but
94:02 - something along those lines i guess
94:04 - would be
94:05 - you know what i'd want to do
94:13 - uh
94:14 - alicia asks are you doing css styling
94:18 - right now
94:19 - um no i mean right we're just kind of
94:21 - doing question and answer stuff right
94:23 - now so if you want to see the css part
94:24 - you can watch the recording so you can
94:26 - go back and watch the beginning and we
94:28 - did that like the
94:29 - the end here we're just doing question
94:31 - answers so if you have any questions uh
94:33 - please you know feel free to put them in
94:35 - the in the live chat
94:46 - uh nino says what would you consider
94:48 - yourself a web designer a web developer
94:51 - um
94:52 - i consider myself a developer that
94:55 - does design occasionally when when i
94:57 - need to
94:58 - so we don't really have where i work at
95:00 - we don't have a dedicated web designer
95:04 - so i do have to do some of that work but
95:07 - it's it's i think a small part of of
95:10 - what i do so i've
95:12 - with a lot of help from google's
95:13 - material design i've developed a style
95:16 - guide for university websites and then i
