00:00 - hello everyone in this video I will be
00:02 - showing you how to make a flappy bird
00:03 - type game in scratch for those of you
00:06 - who don't know what scratches scratch is
00:08 - a block-based programming language where
00:10 - you can drag and drop blocks to create
00:12 - projects it's more of an educational
00:15 - type of visual programming language to
00:17 - teach children how to code
00:18 - there's also a online community where
00:21 - you can view other people's projects and
00:22 - share your own anyways to get started go
00:25 - to scratch.mit.edu which is the scratch
00:28 - website once you're there you can either
00:30 - create a new account by clicking the
00:31 - join scratch button over here or scroll
00:34 - down and download the offline editor
00:36 - which is the same thing if you're using
00:39 - the online version once you have created
00:41 - an account you can click the create
00:43 - button over here to start a new project
00:46 - so let's start by creating the bird so
00:50 - um I'm gonna go to the costumes of the
00:52 - scratch cat
00:53 - and I'm going to delete the second one
00:57 - and I'm going to clear this one and I'll
01:00 - draw my own bird so I'll start by
01:02 - creating a circle
01:05 - let's see about this size I think now
01:09 - I'm going to add a black outline to it
01:13 - right here to maybe a
01:17 - I think size five is good I'll decrease
01:19 - the circle a little bit though
01:21 - maybe to uh
01:24 - this big
01:26 - all right and since I'm making a bird
01:29 - I'll make it yellow on the inside
01:34 - so about this color
01:35 - all right so let's see now I'll draw the
01:38 - eye
01:39 - so
01:40 - um I'm drawing another Circle
01:45 - um I'll make it this big
01:47 - and I'll position this
01:50 - right over here
01:55 - okay
01:57 - I'll actually make this fill black
01:59 - and I'll
02:00 - keep the outline so yeah now I'm going
02:03 - to draw a beak so I'll draw two lines
02:06 - like this
02:09 - okay
02:11 - and I'll make the fill yellow
02:15 - actually the same color as the bird so
02:17 - this
02:19 - and then I gotta make sure the beak is
02:22 - under the bird so I'm going to shift it
02:25 - backwards
02:26 - like that
02:29 - and I think I'm going to add some legs
02:32 - so I'll just draw some quick lines like
02:34 - this
02:39 - and there
02:41 - so yeah this is a really quick uh
02:43 - drawing um I don't want to spend too
02:45 - much time drawing so that's why I
02:47 - quickly created a bird so yeah anyways
02:50 - now I am done and I'm going to go back
02:52 - to the code
02:55 - and now let's start coding the bird
02:58 - so I want the bird to be able to jump
03:00 - when I press the mouse button
03:03 - so to do that let's go to the events
03:06 - and then drag this windfly clicked onto
03:09 - here
03:10 - and now let's go to control and then
03:13 - grab a forever Loop
03:16 - and I'm going to drag and if then
03:19 - statement
03:21 - and then I'm going to go to sensing
03:23 - that's where the mouse down stuff is
03:25 - then I'll drag the mouse down into the
03:27 - if then so pretty much what happens is
03:30 - that when I press the green flag then
03:32 - this keeps checking if the mouse is down
03:35 - so now we want to actually do stuff when
03:38 - the mouse is down so
03:40 - um first of all we want the bird to be
03:42 - affected by gravity so pretty much when
03:45 - the bird falls it falls faster and
03:47 - faster over time so to do that we
03:49 - actually have to create a variable so
03:51 - let's go to variables
03:53 - and let's create one let's call this
03:57 - um
03:58 - uh y
04:00 - velocity
04:03 - and let's select for the Sprite only
04:06 - so pretty much this variable is only or
04:10 - actually a can only be used by the bird
04:12 - so now let's click ok
04:15 - and what our y velocity variable is
04:18 - going to do is that it's going to be the
04:21 - speed of the bird in the Y position
04:23 - which is up and down so pretty much if
04:26 - our y velocity is going to be 3 then the
04:29 - bird is going to move upwards constantly
04:32 - at uh three units and if our y velocity
04:36 - is let's say negative 10 then our bird
04:39 - is going to move downwards constantly by
04:42 - 10 units however we want the bird to
04:45 - move downwards uh faster and faster
04:48 - right we want the bird to fall faster
04:50 - and faster over time so we're going to
04:52 - actually be changing the Y velocity
04:54 - which means that we're going to be
04:56 - changing the speed in which the bird
04:58 - moves down over time so it's like
05:00 - gravity so let's first
05:02 - um set the Y velocity to zero when the
05:05 - flag is clicked
05:07 - and um okay let's make the birds start
05:09 - over here
05:10 - so that's like
05:12 - let's go to motion so
05:14 - negative 172 and 0 in the Y position
05:19 - um and then
05:20 - let's see so
05:22 - what we want is that we want the Y
05:24 - position of the bird to be always
05:27 - changing by the Y velocity variable or
05:31 - the speed so um actually to make this
05:33 - more clear I'm going to rename the Y
05:35 - velocity variable to uh change in y
05:41 - so I think that's easier to understand
05:43 - but anyways let's go back to the motion
05:45 - blocks and what I'm going to do is drag
05:48 - a change Y block
05:50 - drag it inside of the forever Loop
05:53 - and then I'll go to variables and drag
05:56 - the change in y variable inside of the
05:59 - change y by block
06:02 - so what this is is that the Y position
06:04 - of the bird is always going to change by
06:06 - the change in y
06:08 - so now we have to set the values for the
06:11 - change in y so
06:13 - um if we press the mouse button we want
06:16 - to set the change in y by let's say
06:21 - um nine
06:22 - so pretty much what happens is that when
06:25 - we click
06:26 - then the speed of the bird will be going
06:29 - upwards by nine and it would keep going
06:32 - up so let's try it out
06:34 - when we press then it keeps going up
06:37 - like that
06:38 - so yeah but now of course we want the
06:41 - bird to fall so what we can do is
06:43 - actually just drag a change change in y
06:47 - by block and put it in the forever Loop
06:51 - and let's change it by let's say
06:53 - negative zero point eight
06:56 - sorry negative 0.8
07:00 - so since there is gravity we always want
07:02 - the bird to be going downwards
07:04 - so now let's try it out
07:07 - now as you can see it works
07:11 - um there's gravity because uh the bird
07:13 - keeps going down by negative 0.8
07:16 - and then when we press the mouse button
07:18 - then the speed of the bird changes to
07:22 - nine
07:24 - so um yeah that's a really simple um
07:26 - jumping script we have right here
07:29 - and anyways that'll do it for right now
07:31 - uh for the bird
07:32 - so now let's create our pipes where the
07:36 - bird's gonna go through so let's click
07:38 - the button over here and let's create a
07:40 - new Sprite
07:42 - so um I'm just going to draw some simple
07:45 - pipes uh let's see I'm going to draw a
07:49 - rectangle
07:51 - like this
07:54 - and I'm going to make the pipes green
07:59 - and all right
08:02 - now I'm going to add another rectangle
08:04 - put it right here
08:08 - like this
08:11 - okay I'll make the pipes a bit thicker
08:18 - all right
08:22 - okay
08:26 - cool all right so this is going to be
08:28 - the top pipe and now we want the bottom
08:31 - pipe so let's create a new costume
08:36 - actually um let's duplicate this one and
08:39 - then I'm just gonna flip it so let's
08:41 - select the entire thing and then let's
08:44 - uh flip uh vertically
08:47 - and now we have the bottom pipe all
08:49 - right so we have the top and the bottom
08:51 - pipe so let's first name these I'll name
08:54 - this top pipe
08:57 - and this one bottom pipe
09:00 - and all right let's go back to the code
09:03 - so of course we want a winify clicked
09:08 - and um what we want is that we want this
09:12 - Sprite to be creating copies of the top
09:15 - and bottom pipe because we're going to
09:16 - have more than one pipe on the screen at
09:19 - any given time so just to make it easier
09:21 - to manage we don't want the actual
09:24 - Sprite to show so let's go to looks and
09:27 - then hide the Sprite
09:29 - when the flag is clicked
09:31 - and now
09:32 - um we we want the Sprite to keep
09:34 - creating clones so let's go to control
09:36 - and then drag a forever Loop
09:39 - and let's uh go to events
09:44 - um oh sorry not events of control and
09:47 - let's drag a create clone of myself
09:49 - and put it inside of the forever Loop so
09:52 - I'm just going to keep creating clones
09:53 - of the pipe and um we actually wanted to
09:56 - create two clones of the pipe because we
09:58 - have a top and the bottom pipe
10:02 - so if we try it right now then it's only
10:04 - going to create the Clones of the bottom
10:06 - pipe oh of course the pipes aren't shown
10:09 - but um anyways if we do show the pipes
10:11 - let's just drag it when they start as a
10:13 - clone and also a show
10:17 - then the pipes are there's like tons of
10:20 - clones of the pipes like that
10:22 - but we want the Sprite to simultaneously
10:25 - create the top and bottom pipes
10:27 - so uh let's actually first create a
10:30 - variable
10:32 - and let's name this
10:36 - um
10:37 - bottom
10:39 - or top
10:40 - pipe I guess
10:42 - and make sure to select for the swipe
10:44 - only this is very important otherwise it
10:46 - won't work so select for the Sprite only
10:49 - and then click ok
10:52 - and now uh what we want to do is to set
10:55 - bottom or top pipe and then drag it to
10:58 - the further Loop right before it creates
11:00 - a clone of itself
11:02 - and let's set it to top
11:05 - and then let's uh duplicate this
11:09 - and then put it under here
11:11 - and then we want to set bottom or top
11:14 - pipe to bottom
11:17 - and then it creates clone of itself
11:18 - again
11:19 - so I'll explain to you later what this
11:21 - does but pretty much the Clone is going
11:24 - to use this variable to know whether it
11:26 - is the top or the bottom pipe
11:28 - so anyways
11:30 - um let's add a weight in here so let's
11:33 - go to events actually a control
11:36 - and then let's drag a way to one second
11:38 - and I'll change this to maybe three
11:40 - seconds all right and now in the when I
11:44 - start as a clone we want to show it
11:46 - and now we want to add a if else
11:49 - statement so let's drag that
11:52 - and we want to check if it's the top
11:54 - pipe then it switches its costume to the
11:58 - top pipe costume and if it's the bottom
12:00 - pipe then it's going to switch costume
12:02 - to the bottom pipe costume so that's why
12:05 - we use this variable
12:06 - so um let's do that so let's go to
12:09 - operators
12:10 - grab an equals operator drag inside of
12:13 - here
12:14 - and let's go to variables grab the
12:16 - bottom or top pipe variable put inside
12:18 - here
12:20 - and if the bottom or top pipe variable
12:22 - is equal to bottom make sure it's uh
12:26 - spelled the same as how you spelled it
12:28 - here
12:29 - but if it's bottom then we want it to
12:32 - switch costume
12:34 - to bottom pipe
12:36 - and else if it is top then we switch
12:39 - costume to top pipe
12:42 - so it's as simple as that
12:44 - now let's try this out it's not going to
12:47 - work but let's just see how it is so far
12:50 - so as you can see this actually spawns
12:52 - the top and bottom pipe like that
12:55 - all right so now we want the top and
12:58 - bottom pipes to actually be positioned
13:01 - correctly we want the top pipe right
13:04 - here and bottom pipe right here
13:07 - so to do that
13:08 - uh for now let's just go to motion and
13:11 - grab a go to put it after the switch
13:14 - costume to bottom pipe
13:16 - and for the bottom pipe Let's uh
13:20 - let's see
13:22 - let's make it go like right here for now
13:28 - so we want to spawn at the edge of the
13:31 - screen right because the pipes are going
13:32 - to move from the right to the left so
13:35 - exposition
13:37 - 259
13:39 - and Y position negative two one two
13:42 - all right and for the top pipe
13:47 - um let's see
13:49 - let's make it spawn
13:52 - let's say right here so 259 and Y
13:55 - position 54.
13:58 - all right so let's try that for now
14:01 - so as you can see the top and bottom
14:03 - pipes spawn like this
14:05 - and now we want the top and bottom pipes
14:07 - to move to the left side of the screen
14:09 - right so to do this is to um go to
14:12 - control
14:13 - and grab a repeat until block let's put
14:16 - that after the if else statement
14:18 - so what the repeat until block does is
14:20 - that it keeps doing something as long as
14:23 - the thing in here is true and then after
14:27 - the thing in here is false then it runs
14:29 - the code after so of course since we
14:33 - want the blocks to disappear after
14:36 - reaching the left side of the screen
14:38 - uh we want to grab a operator let's grab
14:42 - a lesser than operator put inside here
14:45 - and let's go to motion grab the
14:48 - X position uh block right here drag it
14:51 - inside of the repeat until operator
14:54 - and we want to check if the X position
14:56 - is less than a certain number then the
15:00 - Clones delete itself
15:01 - so let's see let's first show the
15:03 - initial Sprite and let's see
15:07 - right here so if the X position is less
15:10 - than negative 237 then the Clones should
15:14 - delete themselves so let's go to a
15:16 - control
15:17 - and let's grab a delete this clone and
15:20 - drag it after the repeat until
15:23 - so of course we want the pipes to be
15:25 - moving to the left until the X position
15:28 - is less than negative 237. so let's go
15:30 - to motion and let's grab a change X by
15:35 - block and put it inside of the repeat
15:37 - until
15:39 - and let's change it by let's say
15:41 - negative five
15:43 - so we want the pipes to move towards the
15:47 - left by five units until it reaches the
15:50 - edge here and then it hides
15:52 - so yeah let's try it out
15:55 - and as you can see the pipes work like
15:58 - that
15:59 - and we can like increase or decrease the
16:01 - spawn rate
16:02 - so maybe you can wait like one second
16:04 - and we can see
16:07 - there's the pipes like this
16:09 - and they also disappear
16:11 - um once they touch the left edge of the
16:13 - screen and they appear from the right
16:16 - so yeah the pipes seem to be working
16:18 - however we want spawning in the Y
16:21 - position
16:22 - so to do that we actually have to create
16:24 - a new variable so let's create a new
16:27 - variable
16:28 - let's call it
16:31 - random
16:33 - uh
16:35 - y spawn I guess
16:38 - random y spawn position
16:42 - and
16:43 - let's select uh for this file only
16:47 - and then click ok
16:48 - so um what we want to do is to set a
16:52 - random y position for the blocks to
16:55 - spawn from so to do that let's first
16:58 - drag this um into this forever Loop
17:01 - before it creates clones of the pipes
17:04 - and let's go to operators to grab the
17:08 - pick random and put it inside of the set
17:11 - random y spawn position
17:13 - and
17:15 - um let's see let's maybe okay let's deal
17:18 - with this later but let's see the range
17:21 - in which the pipes can spawn so I'm
17:24 - going to show the original Sprite
17:27 - and I'm going to do some testing
17:29 - so let's see
17:32 - um I think the top pipe should be right
17:33 - here around
17:35 - this would be the highest point it can
17:38 - spawn
17:39 - so that's why position 153
17:42 - and
17:44 - the lowest position for the bottom pipe
17:47 - is going to be let's say right here so
17:50 - negative 284.
17:53 - so for now let's just put in uh one what
17:56 - was it again 153 I think
18:00 - yeah 153 to negative 284 I think
18:07 - let's just double check
18:12 - yeah something like that all right so
18:14 - this is going to be the range in which
18:16 - the pipes can spawn
18:17 - but oh yeah one important thing I think
18:20 - to make this easier let's go do the
18:22 - costumes
18:23 - and make sure that the pipes are
18:25 - actually positioned where we want them
18:27 - so
18:29 - let's say uh let's copy this bottom pipe
18:32 - and put it into the top pipe for now
18:36 - and let's say we want our space to be
18:39 - this big right
18:41 - then we want to make sure that the top
18:44 - pipe and bottom pipe are positioned like
18:47 - this in each of their costumes so I'm
18:49 - going to move this to the middle
18:51 - right here
18:54 - okay I think this is the middle
18:57 - all right
18:58 - so right here
18:59 - so now I'm going to delete the bottom
19:01 - pipe
19:04 - or actually not yet I'm going to first
19:07 - duplicate this
19:08 - and then I'm going to delete the bottom
19:10 - pipe
19:12 - and now I'm gonna go to my duplicate
19:16 - and then I'm going to delete the top
19:17 - pipe
19:19 - and now we don't need this extra bottom
19:22 - pipe costume so yeah
19:25 - anyways now we have the top pipe and
19:28 - bottom pipe uh where we want them
19:31 - and I'm going to first rename this to
19:33 - bottom pipe
19:34 - all right cool
19:36 - so of course you can change the space in
19:39 - which is between the top and bottom pipe
19:41 - so that's up to you but yeah let's go
19:44 - back to the code now
19:46 - and let's see let's find our range in y
19:50 - positions again now so
19:54 - um let's see for the top pipe I'd say
19:57 - y position 79
20:00 - and for the bottom pipe I'd say y
20:03 - position
20:04 - negative 79. all right that works well
20:09 - so now because I repositioned these two
20:12 - pipes to where I want them it's now
20:15 - super easy so all you have to do is to
20:18 - go to variables and then drag the random
20:21 - y spawn position into the go to
20:24 - x y and in the Y so let's drag that into
20:27 - here for both the top and the bottom
20:30 - pipe
20:31 - and now let's try it out
20:34 - so
20:36 - as you can see it works however the
20:39 - pipes are
20:40 - um entirely on the screen like there's
20:44 - some empty space
20:45 - but of course we can go to the costumes
20:47 - and change that but at least the random
20:50 - y position works
20:52 - so as you can see they're spawned
20:54 - randomly
20:55 - so to change or actually to fix the
20:58 - problem let's go to costumes
21:01 - and all we need to do is to increase
21:05 - this length of the rectangle so let's
21:08 - drag this entire rectangle
21:09 - down here
21:12 - and I'm going to
21:14 - drag this rectangle upwards like this
21:18 - all right now I'm going to select the
21:20 - entire thing
21:21 - and then drag it back up
21:24 - I think it was right around here
21:28 - uh
21:29 - okay maybe a bit more downwards
21:34 - yeah about right all right and now let's
21:36 - do the same for the bottom pipe
21:38 - move it up here
21:40 - drag the rectangle down here
21:43 - and then drag the entire thing back down
21:46 - so right around here I think
21:50 - so yeah all right looks good
21:53 - um okay I think this one's positioned a
21:55 - bit to the left so I'll move it back
22:01 - maybe this one a bit to the left
22:06 - all right cool
22:08 - so now let's run it
22:10 - and as you can see the pipes now spawn
22:13 - like this they're in a random y position
22:15 - and the entire pipe uh covers like
22:19 - both the top and the bottom edges of the
22:22 - screen so awesome
22:25 - um I think I'm going to increase the Gap
22:27 - a bit because I don't think the bird can
22:29 - go through like very easily
22:32 - or uh if it's possible at all so
22:36 - let's increase the Gap and to do that
22:38 - it's really simple you just move the top
22:40 - and the bottom pipe upwards and
22:42 - downwards so the top pipe upwards like
22:45 - this
22:46 - and the bottom pipe downwards like this
22:50 - all right and make sure your Gap is
22:53 - equal on both the top and the bottom
22:55 - compared to the middle like over here
22:57 - versus over here
22:59 - so yeah it looks about right now let's
23:01 - try it
23:02 - and now the Gap is much larger so
23:05 - awesome
23:08 - um I'll make the bird a bit smaller I
23:09 - think so I'll go back to the bird
23:12 - I'm gonna go to looks and change the
23:15 - size or set the size to maybe 80.
23:19 - okay I think that's better
23:21 - so yeah
23:23 - now I think for the bird
23:25 - it looks a bit like too still when it
23:29 - jumps so I think I'm going to rotate it
23:31 - when it jumps so it looks like it's
23:33 - actually flapping
23:35 - so to do that let's um just go to motion
23:38 - and drag a point in Direction and drag
23:41 - it under the if Mouse down
23:44 - and I'm going to change it to
23:47 - um let's say 45 degrees
23:50 - and what this does is that it's going to
23:52 - change it to like this when it drops but
23:55 - of course we want the bird to rotate
23:57 - back to its original position which was
24:00 - 90 degrees
24:01 - so let's just grab an if statement
24:06 - and then put it inside of the forever
24:08 - Loop
24:09 - and let's go to operators grab a lesser
24:12 - than operator
24:14 - and we want to check if the direction
24:17 - which is in the motions
24:19 - is less than 90
24:22 - which was its starting Direction then we
24:25 - want it to turn uh clockwise
24:28 - let's say three degrees
24:32 - so pretty much if the bird is like this
24:35 - then it's Gonna Keep rotating until it
24:37 - faces the right so let's try it out
24:40 - now as you can see there is some motion
24:42 - with the bird
24:43 - so when it flaps it sort of moves back
24:46 - like that
24:48 - so I think it looks better like this
24:50 - and I might change it to maybe turn four
24:52 - degrees
24:54 - so let's try it all right
24:57 - I think that looks much better
25:00 - so yeah
25:01 - um now
25:02 - let's make a simple lose state so when
25:06 - the bird touches the pipes then let's
25:08 - just stop the game for right now so uh
25:11 - let's see
25:12 - let's drag a if statement inside of the
25:16 - forever Loop
25:18 - and let's go to sensing
25:20 - and it's detect
25:22 - if touching Sprite 2 or the pipes
25:26 - then it's going to stop all so let's go
25:29 - to control
25:30 - and let's stop everything
25:33 - so let's try it out
25:37 - and yeah when it touched a pipe then the
25:40 - entire game stopped all right
25:42 - so okay I'm going to first hide all of
25:44 - my variables
25:46 - all right
25:48 - so now let's try it again
25:52 - okay and when it touched the pipe then
25:55 - the entire game stopped all right cool
26:00 - okay
26:02 - and it's like this
26:05 - okay
26:06 - um I think I'm going to add a simple
26:08 - background so I'll go to backdrops here
26:10 - go to costumes or backdrops and then I'm
26:13 - going to
26:15 - fill it
26:16 - or actually I'll convert to bitmap
26:18 - and then I'll fill this maybe to a light
26:21 - blue
26:24 - let's see
26:29 - like this
26:30 - and all right
26:32 - now we have some simple backdrop
26:35 - so um yeah this is our completed game
26:39 - we're actually not completed but a
26:41 - completed working game
26:43 - so all right cool
26:45 - let's see
26:46 - yeah this is a bit hard right now but
26:48 - you know you can tweak it
26:50 - to change the difficulty to make it
26:53 - easier maybe so yeah
27:01 - this is part two on how to make a Flappy
27:03 - Bird game in scratch in this tutorial I
27:06 - will be creating an infinite scrolling
27:08 - background and a scoring system so the
27:11 - first thing I wanted to add that I
27:13 - didn't do in the last video was to make
27:15 - the bird
27:16 - uh be able to lose when it reaches the
27:18 - bottom of the screen over here
27:21 - so to do that it's actually really
27:23 - simple let's go to operators
27:24 - and then grab an or statement
27:28 - and let's put it over here
27:30 - so
27:31 - if the bird is touching Sprite two which
27:34 - are the pipes or if the bird's y
27:36 - position
27:37 - is less than a certain value
27:42 - um let's see if it's less than
27:45 - negative 171
27:49 - then we want to stop the game
27:52 - so let's try it out if the bird goes to
27:54 - the bottom here then the Game Stops all
27:57 - right so now that we're done with that
27:59 - I'm going to start creating the
28:01 - scrolling background so I was thinking
28:03 - of maybe adding some hills in the
28:06 - background and then making them moving
28:08 - slowly to the left to make it look like
28:10 - the bird is you know moving
28:12 - so let's do that so let's first create a
28:15 - new Sprite
28:17 - and now I'm going to draw my Hills
28:25 - all right so I'm done with my hill and
28:28 - what I did was that I just made a
28:30 - rectangle across the entire drawing area
28:32 - and then I used this v-shape tool to you
28:36 - know add a few points and then I just
28:38 - moved these points around to make it
28:41 - curvy
28:42 - all right so make sure that the width of
28:46 - your Hill is exactly the same width as
28:48 - the drawing area no more no less as you
28:52 - can see I made this very exact
28:55 - so yeah and also make sure that the
28:58 - height of the left Edge over here is the
29:01 - exact same height as the height of the
29:03 - right Edge over here anyways uh this
29:06 - will do for now and let me go back to
29:09 - the code
29:11 - uh so first off I'm going to grab a one
29:14 - fly clicked in the events
29:16 - and then I'm going to make the hills go
29:19 - to zero zero
29:22 - so now it's in the center of the screen
29:23 - and what I want is that I want this hill
29:26 - to constantly move towards the left so
29:29 - to do that let's go to control grab a
29:32 - forever Loop
29:34 - and then let's go to motion
29:36 - grab the change X by block put it inside
29:39 - of the further Loop
29:41 - and let's say let's change X by negative
29:45 - three
29:47 - all right so if we try right now
29:49 - then the hill as you can see always
29:51 - moves towards the left by three units
29:54 - all right so um since I'm going to be
29:57 - testing this hill a lot I'm going to
29:59 - disconnect the code from the chicken and
30:02 - and the pipes
30:06 - so you know it's only the hill and I'm
30:08 - also going to hide the chicken
30:10 - all right
30:12 - so now this is just a hill
30:15 - so yeah all right cool
30:17 - so now that the hill moves now we want
30:20 - the hill to go from the left edge of the
30:22 - screen to the right edge of the screen
30:24 - once it reaches the end over here so to
30:28 - do that let's grab an if statement
30:31 - and let's put this inside of the forever
30:33 - Loop
30:35 - and we want to check if the X position
30:37 - of the hills are less than a certain
30:40 - value
30:41 - so let's go to operators
30:43 - grab a less than operator go to motion
30:45 - grab an X position
30:48 - and let's check if the X position is
30:50 - less than
30:52 - um negative
30:56 - 464. so what I did was that I found the
30:59 - smallest possible value for this right
31:01 - which is a negative 465 and then I just
31:05 - added one so yeah so once the X position
31:08 - of the hills is less than negative 464
31:12 - then we want it to move to the right
31:14 - side of the screen
31:16 - so since I made this hill the exact
31:19 - width of the screen which is 480 pixels
31:23 - or units then what I can do is just
31:26 - simply uh set X to its current X
31:30 - position over here multiplied by
31:32 - negative one
31:34 - so let's go to operators grab the
31:36 - negative one operator
31:38 - drag it inside of the set X2
31:40 - and then go to motion grab the X
31:42 - position
31:43 - and type in negative one
31:46 - all right so let's try it out
31:48 - once the hill reaches the left side of
31:51 - the screen
31:52 - then it teleports to the right side
31:55 - all right so it works
31:57 - it's infinite like this
32:01 - let's see it again
32:03 - and all right it works
32:05 - so uh oh yeah one thing I noticed was
32:07 - that it's not very smooth
32:09 - as you can see here
32:12 - you can see that it sort of gets cut off
32:14 - early before it teleports to the right
32:17 - side so I don't really want that to
32:19 - happen let's say it again as you can see
32:22 - it doesn't completely go off the screen
32:25 - so that's sort of something that scratch
32:28 - has and to actually fix the issue I'm
32:31 - just going to go to looks and grab a set
32:34 - size to block and right before it
32:38 - changes X by negative three and checks
32:41 - if the X position is less than negative
32:43 - 464. I'm going to set size to 150
32:48 - percent
32:50 - and right after the hill moves and
32:53 - checks for all the stuff then I'm going
32:56 - to set the size back to 100 percent
32:59 - so like this before all of your code put
33:01 - in set size to 1 to 50 and then right
33:04 - after put set size to 100 percent
33:08 - so this is sort of complicated to
33:10 - explain but pretty much what this does
33:12 - is that
33:14 - um the set size makes the hills bigger
33:17 - then it's actually supposed to be which
33:19 - is 100 percent
33:20 - so right before it moves it can
33:23 - technically go off screen
33:25 - but then right after it moves it changes
33:28 - back to its original size
33:30 - so you wouldn't even notice that it's
33:33 - 150 of its normal size
33:36 - so let's try it out
33:38 - and let's see
33:42 - now oh oops okay I forgot to change this
33:45 - to if the X position is less than
33:48 - negative 480 or actually a negative 479
33:52 - so since the left edge of the screen is
33:56 - negative 240 and the entire size of this
33:59 - costume is 480 then half of the costume
34:02 - size is going to be 240 and then once
34:06 - you subtract
34:07 - 240 from negative 240 then that is the
34:11 - rightmost edge
34:13 - of the Sprite at the leftmost edge
34:16 - so yeah um that was again sort of
34:18 - confusing uh sorry but it should make
34:20 - sense visually so now let's try it out
34:22 - again
34:26 - and
34:28 - as you can see now the hill smoothly
34:31 - goes from the left side to the right
34:33 - side
34:34 - so let's see it again
34:37 - and all right so it works cool and I'm
34:41 - actually going to quickly add a uh dark
34:43 - green outline
34:45 - because I think the light green uh is
34:47 - sort of too close to the light blue
34:50 - color of the sky so yeah I'm just going
34:52 - to quickly add a line over here
34:58 - all right so I'm done with my outline I
35:01 - just pretty much added a line and then I
35:04 - just reshaped it using this tool to fit
35:06 - the hill
35:07 - all right so now I think it looks better
35:10 - let's try it again
35:12 - and as you can see there's the hill
35:15 - and then teleports back
35:17 - so now we need to add the second Hill
35:19 - because once the hill is moving then
35:22 - there's a lot of empty space and we
35:24 - don't want that
35:26 - so to add a second Hill all we need to
35:28 - do is to go to control and then create
35:31 - clone of myself
35:33 - all right
35:34 - and
35:36 - um we want to make the Clone do the
35:38 - exact same thing as the original Sprite
35:41 - however the only difference will be that
35:43 - the Clone is shifted to the right of the
35:46 - Sprite so let's grab a1sr as a clone
35:50 - then let's go to motion and then let's
35:53 - drag this go to x480 and then y0 and
35:57 - make sure to go to looks grab the set
36:00 - size to 150 put it before the go to XY
36:03 - and then grab the set size 100 and then
36:05 - put it after
36:07 - since uh we want the Clone to go
36:09 - completely off screen so yeah
36:12 - anyway since the Clone is going to have
36:14 - exactly the same code as the original
36:16 - Sprite we're going to create a block so
36:19 - let's go to my blocks and then make a
36:21 - block let's call this uh
36:24 - move
36:25 - then let's click ok
36:28 - all right now we have move and now we
36:31 - want to drag this
36:33 - um set size to 150 and stuff like that
36:37 - into the move and now we can drag our
36:40 - move block inside of the forever Loop
36:43 - and okay so my move block did not appear
36:47 - um that sometimes happens so I'm just
36:49 - going to refresh the page
36:51 - there we go so now there is the move
36:54 - block
36:55 - and let's put this inside of the fur
36:57 - Loop
36:59 - and for the Clone let's just duplicate
37:01 - this forever Loop and then put it under
37:03 - the stuff over here
37:05 - all right so now the original Sprite and
37:08 - the Clone both follow the same uh code
37:10 - in the move block so it's sort of
37:12 - simpler because if I want to change
37:14 - something all I need to do is change
37:16 - this one move block instead of you know
37:19 - changing to separate uh blocks like this
37:22 - so all right
37:24 - now let's see how it looks so as you can
37:27 - see there is now a infinite scrolling
37:30 - Hill background
37:31 - and it looks very smooth and uh yeah
37:36 - all right so I think there's a tiny
37:39 - um difference in the line I just drew so
37:43 - I'm just going to fix it real quick
37:45 - let's see
37:46 - it's over here
37:49 - [Music]
37:52 - okay let's try it again
37:55 - uh yeah you can barely tell that I have
37:58 - two Hills
38:00 - so yeah
38:02 - all right so now that we're done with
38:04 - the hill background we can add the
38:05 - chicken and the pipes back
38:07 - so let's
38:09 - um show the chicken
38:11 - then reconnect the blocks
38:13 - then go to the pipes
38:15 - reconnect the blocks also
38:18 - and now we can try it out and okay the
38:22 - hills are in front of both the chicken
38:24 - and the pipes so we want them to go back
38:27 - so let's go to looks and grab a um
38:31 - go backwards
38:34 - let's say 10 layers to make sure that it
38:37 - actually goes back
38:39 - and now let's drag this
38:41 - um in the when flag clicked before it
38:43 - creates a clone of itself
38:45 - and now it works like this
38:48 - all right cool
38:49 - now we have sort of some Parallax going
38:52 - on which is pretty much um the hill
38:54 - moves to the left slower than the pipes
38:57 - do
38:58 - so uh yeah
39:01 - um
39:03 - now we have our infinite background and
39:06 - now we're going to make a simple scoring
39:08 - system
39:09 - so let's go to the pipes
39:12 - and let's see
39:14 - we want to First create a score variable
39:17 - so let's go to variables
39:19 - then create a variable let's call this
39:22 - score then for all Sprites and then
39:24 - click ok
39:26 - all right so what we want to do is that
39:29 - if the bird goes past the middle of the
39:33 - pipes then we want the score to increase
39:35 - by one
39:37 - so um to do that we have to go into
39:40 - pipes and then we want to check
39:43 - if the X position of the bird is greater
39:47 - than the X position of the pipes
39:50 - so let's go to operators
39:52 - and grab a greater than operator
39:55 - and let's go to sensing
39:58 - grab the backdrop number of stage block
40:02 - and change the stage to Sprite one
40:05 - which is the bird
40:07 - and now we have our X position of Sprite
40:10 - 1. so if the X position of the bird is
40:14 - greater than
40:15 - the pipe X position so motion and then X
40:19 - position
40:20 - then we want to go to variables and then
40:23 - change score by one
40:26 - all right now we want to put this inside
40:28 - of the repeat until
40:31 - and now as the pipes are moving to the
40:33 - left it's going to constantly check
40:37 - so now there's uh one problem though
40:40 - whenever the bird is past the pipes the
40:43 - score goes up by a lot because it keeps
40:46 - checking and the score keeps going up
40:47 - but we only want the score to go up once
40:51 - so um to fix that we can just simply
40:54 - create a variable
40:56 - let's name this already scored
40:59 - so already
41:03 - scored
41:04 - and we want to select for the Sprite
41:06 - only
41:07 - this is very important for the Spy only
41:10 - then let's click ok
41:12 - and
41:14 - let's see where is my variable
41:17 - hmm
41:20 - all right so there it is already scored
41:22 - so
41:24 - um what we're going to do is to first
41:26 - set already scored to no
41:29 - because uh when the pipes spawn then the
41:32 - bird hasn't gone through them yet so of
41:35 - course the bird has not scored so let's
41:37 - set this to no put it um before
41:40 - everything in the uh if and repeat until
41:43 - loops
41:45 - and now we want to check if the bird has
41:47 - not yet already scored then we want to
41:50 - change score by one
41:52 - so let's go to operators grab an and
41:55 - and let's grab an equal
41:57 - and let's go to variables grab already
42:00 - scored
42:01 - and let's check if already scored is
42:04 - equals to no
42:06 - now let's drag this over here into the
42:09 - left side
42:10 - and let's put it back
42:12 - so of course it also checks
42:15 - if the bird has already scored and if
42:18 - it's no then it changes score by one
42:21 - but of course once it changes the score
42:23 - by one then it has scored so we don't
42:26 - want this to call again
42:28 - so we just set already scored
42:31 - to yes
42:34 - so now it's only going to call once so
42:37 - let's try it out
42:41 - all right
42:42 - and it doesn't quite work
42:46 - um the score goes up by two
42:48 - so let's see I think to fix this I'm
42:51 - going to make this
42:53 - um set before the score changes by one
42:55 - now let's try it again
42:59 - okay still does not work
43:02 - um let's see
43:04 - um
43:07 - oh yeah that is because we have both the
43:10 - top and the bottom pipe so it acts as
43:13 - two clones and they both check so what
43:16 - we want to do is either only make the
43:18 - top or the bottom pipe check
43:20 - so let's only make the top pipe check
43:23 - so to do that let's grab another
43:25 - operator grab an and
43:27 - grab an equals and let's see check if
43:32 - the bottom or top pipe is equal to top
43:37 - now let's drag this into the left side
43:40 - and I'll check the entire thing back in
43:45 - let me zoom out a bit
43:47 - all right
43:49 - and now it should work so first it
43:52 - checks if the X position of the bird is
43:55 - greater than the current pipe exposition
43:58 - which means that the bird went past it
44:00 - also checks if the bird already scored
44:04 - and also checks if the bottom or top
44:07 - pipe is equal to top
44:08 - then if all of these are true
44:11 - then it sets already scored to yes and
44:14 - then it changes score by one now let's
44:16 - try it out
44:18 - um first of all I'm going to set the
44:21 - score to zero whenever the five is
44:23 - clicked
44:24 - and now we should be good
44:26 - so
44:28 - as you can see the score changes by one
44:30 - every time
44:33 - so yeah all right it works cool
44:37 - let me try it again
44:42 - and yeah
44:45 - um now I have both my scrolling
44:47 - background and the score counter the
44:50 - game also ends when the bird touches the
44:52 - bottom of the screen like this
44:58 - this is part three on how to make a
45:00 - Flappy Bird game in scratch in this
45:02 - video I will be making the pipes go on
45:04 - screen and off screen more smoothly add
45:06 - a number counter for the score and add a
45:09 - simple blue screen anyways let's get
45:12 - started with the pipes so if you see the
45:14 - pipes right now they sort of suddenly
45:16 - appear at the edge of the screen and
45:19 - they don't really smoothly appear and
45:21 - they also disappear before they can
45:24 - completely go off screen like that
45:26 - so I'm going to fix that so let's first
45:29 - go to the pipes and then let's do the
45:32 - same thing we did for the background so
45:34 - in the last video I made the background
45:36 - be able to go on screen and off screen
45:38 - smoothly by first setting its size to a
45:41 - larger size than the actual size we want
45:43 - and then we uh position the background
45:47 - to where we want it and then we set the
45:49 - size back to its original size
45:51 - so let's do the same thing for the pipes
45:53 - so let's go to the pipes
45:55 - and then um right before it spawns Let's
45:59 - uh go to looks and then grab a set size
46:03 - two
46:04 - and let's change this to like 150
46:06 - percent
46:07 - and then drag it right before go to x y
46:11 - and then let's drag a set size to 100
46:14 - right after the go to XY
46:18 - and now let's change the uh X to like
46:21 - maybe 270 to completely make sure that
46:24 - the pipe is starting off screen
46:27 - and um for the top pipe let's do the
46:29 - same thing so set size to 150 put it
46:34 - before and then set size to 100 put it
46:37 - after
46:38 - so let's try it out
46:41 - and they still don't entirely start off
46:46 - screen so
46:48 - um okay I think it should work after we
46:51 - also set size to 150 percent and 100
46:56 - um before and after it changes X by
46:58 - negative five
46:59 - so let's try it out so let's drag this
47:02 - before we change X by negative five and
47:04 - then drag this after the change X by
47:06 - negative five so now let's try it again
47:10 - and
47:11 - yeah I think that works
47:13 - um the pipes as you can see
47:14 - um Spawn from the right side of the
47:16 - screen uh smoothly
47:18 - they don't you know sort of randomly
47:19 - appear from The Edge so yeah
47:22 - and now let's uh fix the
47:26 - um pipes leaving the screen
47:28 - so right now it's still a bit choppy
47:30 - when they leave the screen like that
47:32 - let's see it again
47:34 - yep so still a bit choppy
47:37 - so to fix that
47:39 - all we need to do is to change this x
47:41 - position to a smaller number
47:44 - so maybe let's say if x position is less
47:47 - than 200 and I mean negative 260.
47:52 - now let's try it out
47:54 - oops okay
47:56 - let's try it again
47:58 - let me first reattach this
48:01 - and all right
48:02 - so let's see
48:05 - and cool they also leave the screen
48:07 - smoothly
48:09 - so yeah I think we uh fixed the pipes
48:13 - and all right now that we have the pipes
48:17 - fixed
48:18 - um now I'm going to make a number
48:19 - counter for the score so instead of
48:22 - using this variable I'm going to use
48:24 - actual numbers and that just makes the
48:26 - game look a bit better so yeah let's
48:29 - first create a new Sprite
48:31 - and just paint 10 costumes with the
48:34 - numbers zero through nine so yeah
48:37 - [Music]
48:41 - and yeah so now I have the numbers one
48:44 - two three four five six seven eight nine
48:46 - and then zero so the uh costume names
48:49 - don't matter but the order matters so
48:51 - make sure it's one through nine and then
48:53 - zero at the end so all right now let's
48:55 - go back to the code
48:57 - and let's first grab a win flag clicked
49:00 - then let's hide the original Sprite
49:02 - because we're going to be using clones
49:04 - for this
49:06 - and then let's create a variable
49:09 - uh let's name this I guess uh digits
49:13 - and then select for the Sprite only
49:15 - remember this is very important for the
49:17 - Sprite only because each clone is going
49:20 - to have a different value for the
49:21 - variable so if we do for all Sprites
49:24 - then it's not going to work because
49:26 - whenever the variable changes in value
49:29 - then all of the Clones are going to have
49:31 - the same value for that variable so we
49:34 - want the Clones to have separate values
49:36 - for the digits variable so select for
49:39 - this file only and then click ok
49:42 - all right
49:44 - by the way if your variable doesn't show
49:46 - up immediately after you created it then
49:48 - you can just refresh the page and it
49:50 - should show up
49:51 - but anyways
49:53 - um let's grab a set digits to block
49:55 - and let's set the digits to one
49:59 - and let's drag this after the hide
50:02 - now uh let's go to control
50:05 - grab a repeat Loop
50:07 - and then let's grab a create clone of
50:10 - myself
50:11 - and then go to variables and let's grab
50:14 - a change digits by one and this just
50:17 - creates 10 clones each with a different
50:20 - value of the digits so anyways now we
50:23 - want the Clones to do stuff right so
50:25 - let's go to events actually a control
50:27 - sorry
50:28 - and then let's drag a 1sr as a clone
50:33 - then we want the Clone to show
50:39 - um or actually uh not show yet but yeah
50:42 - so let's go to control grab a forever
50:45 - Loop
50:47 - put it under the when it starts to clone
50:49 - and then we want the Clones to go to a
50:53 - specific position based on its digits
50:55 - variable so let's go to motion
50:59 - and then drag a go to Y position sorry a
51:02 - go to XY position and then let's go to
51:06 - variables grab the digits variable
51:08 - and then go to operators grab the
51:11 - multiplication operator let's drag the
51:13 - digits variable inside of the left side
51:15 - of the operator
51:17 - and let's say uh
51:20 - let's multiply this by 10.
51:24 - now let's drag this inside of the X
51:28 - position of the go to XY
51:30 - and let's place this inside of the
51:33 - forever Loop
51:34 - so if I just run this
51:36 - what this does is that oops okay I need
51:39 - to show the clones for now so yep
51:43 - all right so if I run this then what
51:45 - this does is that it creates 10 clones
51:48 - and they are all spaced apart by 10
51:51 - pixels and this is because each clone
51:53 - has a different digits value because
51:56 - when I first set digits to one and then
51:58 - created a clone the Clone I created the
52:01 - first time had the digits value set to
52:03 - one but then since I changed digits by
52:06 - one the next clone I created has the
52:09 - value of digits to two now
52:11 - and if I change it again and then create
52:13 - another clone then the third clone I
52:16 - created has the value of digits to three
52:18 - so that's how it works each clone I
52:20 - create has a different value of digits
52:24 - but yeah um anyways now we want the
52:28 - Clones to show or hide based on the
52:30 - score so let's say right now the score
52:33 - is two then we only want the uh ones
52:37 - place clone to show or uh this one and
52:40 - then we want all the other ones to hide
52:43 - so to do that let's grab an if else
52:46 - statement in the control drag that in
52:49 - the further Loop
52:51 - and then we want to check
52:53 - um if the length of the score is less
52:56 - than its own variable of digits so let's
53:00 - grab a lesser than operator
53:03 - and then let's grab a length of
53:07 - and let's go to variables
53:10 - and then drag the score variable inside
53:13 - of the length of
53:15 - drag this into the left side
53:17 - and check if a length of score is less
53:19 - than digits
53:21 - so if it is that means we don't need
53:25 - that number
53:26 - and then we just hide it
53:29 - otherwise we want it to show
53:32 - so now as you can see
53:34 - um since the score was two now only one
53:37 - of the digits to show so let's say the
53:40 - score was maybe uh
53:43 - like 270
53:47 - now all three of them show so yeah now
53:50 - we want these clones to show the correct
53:52 - number
53:53 - so um to do that let's go to looks
53:57 - and if you want them to switch costume
54:00 - based on their uh digit in the score
54:04 - so to do that let's go to operators
54:07 - grab the letter operator or actually
54:11 - letter one of Apple
54:12 - and then let's replace the one with
54:15 - digits
54:16 - and then Apple with score
54:20 - now let's drag this inside of the switch
54:22 - costume tube then let's drag this under
54:25 - the show
54:28 - So based on their own digits uh one two
54:31 - and three they're going to show the
54:33 - letter of the score so one two and three
54:36 - so yeah as you can see this shows the
54:39 - correct score
54:40 - now let's reposition this to the top so
54:43 - um just change this y value to maybe uh
54:46 - 150
54:48 - Maybe
54:50 - 155 and I think that's fine and now we
54:54 - can hide the score variable
54:56 - now um I think I'm going to want my
54:58 - score to be in the middle but however
55:01 - there is a problem
55:02 - so since the score is in the middle when
55:05 - the length of the score increases I
55:07 - still want my score to stay in the
55:09 - middle so right now it's not going to
55:11 - work let's say I set the score to
55:16 - um a really high number
55:17 - let's say like this
55:19 - and this score has a one two three four
55:23 - seven digits so let's set it and as you
55:26 - can see this number is not in the middle
55:28 - because it's still in the same X
55:31 - position
55:32 - so um I want to fix that so that this
55:35 - number is in the middle no matter how
55:37 - many digits the score is
55:39 - so to do that uh let's grab a length of
55:43 - score so length of and then score
55:48 - and we want this to move back based on
55:50 - the length of the score right so
55:53 - um now let's go to operators
55:54 - grab a multiplication operator
55:57 - drag this on the left side
55:59 - and make sure to multiply this by the
56:01 - same number you multiplied the digits by
56:03 - so in my case it would be 10
56:07 - and now we want to subtract this from
56:10 - the original X position so let's grab a
56:13 - minus operator drag this on the left
56:16 - side drag this on the right side
56:18 - and oh yeah one more thing since we want
56:21 - the score to stay in the middle we want
56:23 - to divide this by two
56:27 - so let's put this on the left side
56:29 - and then divide by two all right now
56:34 - let's drag this inside of the minus
56:36 - operator and drag this back
56:39 - so as you can see the number is now in
56:42 - the middle let's try it out so
56:45 - let's say the score is zero
56:49 - then into the middle
56:51 - now let's try uh a hundred
56:53 - still in the middle let's try a thousand
56:56 - and it's still in the middle all right
56:59 - um and just to make this more clear like
57:01 - uh these numbers here I'm just going to
57:03 - create a variable
57:05 - and I'll just name this space
57:08 - between
57:11 - digits I guess
57:13 - then I'll click ok
57:15 - and
57:16 - um
57:18 - I'll just set this to
57:21 - 10
57:23 - and then drag this to replace the tens
57:27 - all right now it's more clear
57:28 - and it's also easier to change because I
57:31 - can just change this variable to
57:33 - increase or decrease the space
57:35 - so I think I'm going to increase it to
57:37 - maybe 12.
57:39 - and all right I think that looks good so
57:42 - yeah now let's try it out
57:45 - and let's see how the score variable
57:46 - works
57:48 - all right it looks pretty good
57:51 - so I'm going to try to get to 10
57:54 - oops okay let me try again
57:57 - so we have zero right now
57:58 - one two three
58:01 - four
58:02 - dang it okay let me try again
58:07 - okay um I don't think I'm gonna get to
58:09 - 10 but uh
58:11 - let's just assume that the score
58:12 - variable Works based on my testing so
58:15 - yeah now that we fix the pipes and added
58:19 - a number counter
58:21 - um now I'm going to add a loose screen
58:23 - so right now when the bird touches the
58:26 - pipes
58:27 - then the Game Stops and that's sort of
58:30 - boring I want the player to be able to
58:32 - maybe have an option to restart the game
58:35 - so to do that
58:37 - um let's create a new Sprite
58:40 - and
58:42 - I'm just going to create a simple loose
58:44 - screen
58:50 - all right so now I have my loose screen
58:52 - and this is going to show up when the
58:54 - game ends so let's go to the code
58:58 - and I actually want this to be
59:00 - transparent so
59:02 - um let's just grab a winfide clicked
59:05 - then let's go to looks
59:08 - um grab this set color effect to zero
59:11 - and change this to Ghost and let's
59:14 - change this to maybe a 50.
59:17 - okay maybe less so 20.
59:20 - and all right maybe a 15 actually
59:23 - and now this blue screen is sort of
59:26 - transparent so now I'm going to create
59:29 - another Sprite
59:31 - and this is going to be for the retry
59:34 - button
59:34 - [Music]
59:39 - all right so now I am done with the
59:42 - retry button and I also changed the
59:44 - loose screen by adding a crying bird so
59:48 - yeah
59:49 - anyways um let's start with the loose
59:51 - screen
59:52 - or actually oh yeah for the retry button
59:54 - I want it to be transparent too so let's
59:58 - also grab a set ghost effect to 15.
60:04 - let me change that to maybe a 25
60:08 - or 30
60:09 - all right so let's go to the loose
60:11 - screen
60:12 - so um we want to First hide this when
60:16 - the flag is clicked
60:17 - however we want this to show when the
60:20 - bird loses
60:21 - so let's go to the bird
60:24 - and
60:26 - right here in the if touching Sprite 2
60:28 - or Y position is less than negative 171
60:32 - we want to broadcast a message to tell
60:35 - the loop screen that the bird lost so
60:38 - let's go to control
60:40 - or actually uh events and then broadcast
60:44 - a new message
60:46 - let's just call this um
60:49 - lose
60:51 - and let's put this in the if touching
60:55 - Spike 2 or Y position is less than
60:58 - negative 171
60:59 - and instead of stop all let's just stop
61:03 - this script so the bird would just um
61:06 - stop all of this and stop moving so yeah
61:10 - all right now in our loose screen we
61:12 - want to grab a when I receive lose then
61:15 - we want the loose screen to show so we
61:18 - just grab a show
61:21 - and this should be good let's also do
61:24 - the same thing for the retry button
61:27 - so when I receive lose then show
61:32 - otherwise when the flag is clicked then
61:34 - hide
61:35 - so yeah let's try it out right now
61:38 - so when the bird crashes into the pipe
61:42 - then there's a you lose
61:43 - and we see that the birds stop moving
61:46 - however the pipes are still moving so to
61:49 - fix that let's just go to the pipes
61:51 - and then grab a when I receive lose
61:55 - then let's uh
61:58 - stop all and change this to stop other
62:02 - scripts in Sprite
62:04 - so by doing that it just stops this
62:06 - block over here and this block over here
62:09 - so now let's try it again
62:11 - when the bird falls let's say
62:12 - then everything stops
62:14 - oh yeah except for the background so
62:16 - let's go to the background
62:18 - and drag a
62:20 - uh when I receive lose
62:23 - then stop other scripts in the Sprite
62:25 - all right let's try it out
62:28 - and now as you can see everything stops
62:30 - now we want this replay button to
62:32 - actually work because right now this
62:35 - doesn't do anything
62:36 - so let's go to the retry button
62:39 - and then let's see
62:42 - um inside of the when I receive lose we
62:44 - want to drag in a further Loop
62:47 - and let's drag in if else statement
62:51 - and then let's go to sensing
62:54 - let's detect if Mouse is down
62:58 - then let's say let's make the retry
63:00 - button a bit darker
63:02 - so let's go to looks
63:05 - and then
63:06 - grab the set color effect to zero drag
63:09 - this inside of the if Mouse down
63:11 - let's change this to brightness
63:14 - and
63:16 - let's set this to
63:18 - maybe negative 10. so this makes it
63:21 - darker let's try it out
63:24 - oh yeah sorry I meant if touching Mouse
63:27 - pointer not if Mouse down so let's
63:29 - actually change that
63:31 - let's go to sensing
63:32 - grab a touchy Mouse pointer and let's
63:36 - replace the mouse down
63:38 - and now let's try it out
63:40 - so as you can see it's now darker
63:43 - however if the mouse pointer is not
63:46 - touching the button anymore
63:47 - we want it to go back to its original
63:50 - brightness
63:51 - so let's go to looks
63:54 - grab the set brightness effect to
63:58 - and let's change it back to zero
64:01 - all right let's try it out
64:03 - and as you can see there's a bit of a
64:06 - button touching effect
64:08 - all right so now we want it to detect if
64:12 - the mouse pointer is down and then we
64:14 - want to restart the entire game
64:16 - so let's go to control
64:19 - grab an if statement
64:21 - put this inside of the if touching Mouse
64:23 - pointer
64:25 - and now we drag the mouse down inside of
64:27 - the if statement
64:29 - and if the mouse is down
64:31 - then we want to let's say broadcast a
64:34 - new message
64:36 - so let's go to events
64:38 - and broadcast a new message let's just
64:41 - say uh
64:43 - play
64:46 - now let's drag this inside of the if
64:48 - Mouse down
64:49 - let's also stop this entire script after
64:52 - it broadcasts play so that it doesn't
64:56 - keep on broadcasting play so let's just
64:59 - drag a stop all and change this to South
65:03 - despite or stop the script
65:05 - so right now it's not going to do
65:08 - anything
65:08 - and that's because we need the Sprites
65:11 - to restart all of their actions when the
65:13 - play is broadcasted
65:15 - so let's first go to the chicken
65:19 - and instead of the win flag clicked
65:22 - let's replace that with the when I
65:24 - receive play
65:27 - like this
65:28 - all right let's do the same for the
65:31 - pipes so instead of the win flag clicked
65:34 - we want the when I receive play
65:38 - then it does all of that and for the
65:41 - background
65:42 - let's replace the win flag clicks
65:47 - and for the number counter
65:51 - replace the win flag clicked
65:56 - and then for the you lose
66:01 - replace the one fly clicked
66:06 - and also for the retry button
66:11 - all right so now that we've replaced all
66:14 - of the windfly clicked with plays that
66:16 - means that now all of this is replayable
66:19 - so as long as we call the play message
66:23 - then all of this is going to restart
66:26 - however uh when we click the flag we
66:29 - still want to broadcast play right
66:31 - because we want to start the game when
66:33 - we click the flag so yeah I'm just going
66:35 - to put this inside of the chicken
66:37 - and now it should work
66:40 - so it starts the game
66:43 - everything works as normal until we lose
66:45 - and then we start
66:47 - and everything restarts however as you
66:51 - can see there are some problems so let's
66:53 - go to the pipes
66:55 - and I think the problem is because the
66:59 - Clones don't get deleted when um the
67:02 - lose message is broadcasted so let's
67:05 - grab a delete this clone after I receive
67:08 - loose so all of the clones from the
67:11 - previous game should get deleted now
67:13 - let's try it again
67:15 - so when the bird crashes the pipe and
67:18 - then restarts
67:19 - then it works
67:21 - all right cool
67:23 - and one thing for the number counter
67:26 - it's actually better to probably add a
67:29 - when flag clicked
67:31 - then um do all this stuff because we
67:35 - only need to do this once when the green
67:37 - flag is clicked so yeah
67:40 - now this should be good so oh yeah since
67:45 - there's also a clone for the background
67:48 - to make sure there aren't any extra
67:50 - clones on the screen when I restart then
67:53 - we want to delete the Clone
67:56 - so yeah
67:58 - uh
68:01 - now I think this should be good
68:04 - oh yeah okay I forgot to stop other
68:07 - scripts in the Sprite for the number
68:09 - counter so let's just do that just in
68:11 - case
68:12 - so when I receive lose then
68:15 - stop other scripts in this Sprite
68:18 - all right and we don't want to delete
68:21 - these clones because we're only creating
68:23 - them once when the flag is clicked so
68:26 - yeah now let's try it again
68:28 - so everything works as normal
68:31 - then when we lose then there's the loose
68:34 - screen and then if we retry
68:37 - then everything works as normal
68:41 - oops okay except for the number counter
68:43 - so let's see
68:46 - okay actually let me just still add a
68:49 - delete this clone after lose and then
68:52 - let's replace the winfly clicked with
68:56 - um when I receive
68:58 - play
69:00 - all right now I think this should work
69:02 - let's try it out
69:04 - so everything works
69:06 - as normal
69:08 - then we try
69:10 - and
69:12 - it works all right cool
69:15 - so now we have a replayable game
69:21 - and okay what happened here
69:23 - that's weird oh yeah that was because my
69:25 - mouse pointer was on the retry button
69:28 - so uh yeah
69:31 - but
69:33 - yeah this works
69:35 - all right let's see
69:40 - and you lose and then we try
69:44 - and then it restarts
69:47 - all right cool
69:52 - this is part four on how to make a
69:54 - Flappy Bird game in scratch
69:56 - in this tutorial I will be making some
69:58 - improvements to the loose screen adding
70:00 - a countdown text and adding a menu
70:02 - screen
70:03 - so first off our clones of the pipe and
70:06 - the hills don't show up when the game is
70:08 - over and that's because we delete the
70:11 - Clones when the game is over since we
70:13 - don't want the Clones to reappear when
70:15 - the game restarts however we still want
70:18 - them to show when the you lose screen
70:20 - pops up but we can't really put the
70:23 - delete this clone after the when I
70:26 - receive play because it wouldn't really
70:28 - work so let's just say um for the pipes
70:30 - for example
70:31 - I move the delete this clone from the
70:34 - when I receive lose to when I receive
70:37 - play
70:39 - then if you try it
70:40 - then we lose and then we start
70:42 - then there's these clones of these pipes
70:45 - and it still doesn't work so to fix this
70:48 - we need to broadcast a message after the
70:52 - when I receive lose but before the when
70:54 - I receive play and this way we can
70:56 - safely delete our clones in between the
70:59 - losing and the play
71:01 - so I'm going to first put this back
71:04 - and all right this also ties in
71:06 - perfectly with making the countdown text
71:09 - because the countdown is going to happen
71:12 - after the you lose but before the game
71:15 - starts so what I was thinking for the
71:17 - countdown is that when the game starts
71:19 - it's going to show up like a three two
71:21 - one start and then the game is going to
71:23 - actually start like this so when the
71:26 - countdown is happening the game's gonna
71:27 - actually be paused but yeah
71:31 - so let's make the countdown text uh
71:34 - let's first create a new Sprite
71:36 - and I'm just going to type in the number
71:39 - three
71:42 - all right
71:43 - I'll make this a bit larger
71:46 - like this
71:47 - and then I'll duplicate this
71:49 - I'll type in two
71:52 - duplicate this again type in one and
71:55 - then duplicate this again
71:57 - then I'll type uh go
72:02 - then I'll make sure to Center this in
72:04 - the middle
72:06 - all right so on the screen over here
72:08 - it's going to be three two one go so
72:12 - this is going to be our countdown text
72:14 - all right so currently when the green
72:17 - flag is clicked we broadcast play
72:20 - however we don't want to do that because
72:22 - we want to broadcast our countdown text
72:24 - to start instead
72:26 - so let's create a new message and I'll
72:29 - just call this
72:31 - um start
72:32 - countdown
72:34 - all right click ok
72:36 - and then when the green flag is clicked
72:38 - we want to actually broadcast start
72:40 - countdown
72:41 - so let's go to our countdown Sprite
72:44 - in our countdown Sprite we want to
72:46 - receive the start countdown
72:50 - and then when it receives it we want to
72:52 - first show it
72:56 - and then let's go to motion
72:58 - make sure it goes to X Y zero zero so
73:01 - it's in the center like this
73:05 - and then we want to go to looks and then
73:08 - switch costume to costume one which is
73:11 - the number three
73:13 - and then go to control
73:16 - let's wait maybe 0.5 seconds
73:20 - and then let's actually duplicate this
73:23 - switch costume and wait
73:25 - so duplicate this and then put it under
73:29 - then we want to switch costume to
73:32 - costume two
73:33 - which is the number two
73:35 - and then wait 0.5 seconds
73:38 - and then duplicate this again
73:40 - switch costume to costume one
73:43 - or actually three sorry
73:45 - and then switch costume to costume four
73:47 - which is the go
73:50 - so it's going to be like this three two
73:52 - one go and then at the end we actually
73:55 - want to hide this so go to looks
73:58 - and then hide it
74:00 - so it's like this three two one go and
74:03 - then hide
74:04 - right so if we try it right now
74:06 - then we have our countdown
74:09 - but we actually want the countdown to
74:11 - start the game after it's finished
74:14 - so at the end over here let's go to
74:16 - events and then broadcast
74:20 - play after it finished counting down
74:24 - so let's try it again
74:25 - three two one go and then the game
74:28 - starts all right cool however we still
74:31 - want the game to initialize when the
74:34 - green flag is clicked because right now
74:36 - there's like nothing right and then when
74:38 - the game starts then everything is put
74:40 - into place but we want everything to be
74:42 - ready when the countdown is counting
74:44 - down like this
74:46 - so to do that it's actually pretty easy
74:47 - we have to just go to Every Sprite and
74:50 - then make sure it's in the correct place
74:52 - when it receives the countdown message
74:54 - so for example in the chicken we want it
74:57 - to set its change in y to zero so that's
75:00 - not moving and then go to this position
75:03 - and then set size to 80. and that's
75:06 - going to be under when I receive start
75:09 - countdown
75:10 - so just change that and then for the
75:12 - rest of the actual moving script let's
75:15 - just drag a when I receive play
75:18 - so by doing this the chicken's actually
75:21 - in its starting position when the
75:24 - countdown happens like this
75:26 - all right cool so now time to do the
75:28 - pipes
75:30 - so let's see
75:33 - um
75:34 - I think for the pipes it's fine because
75:36 - when the countdown is happening we don't
75:38 - want any pipes to spawn so the pipes are
75:40 - okay
75:41 - but let's see the Hills
75:44 - so of course when it receives the
75:46 - countdown
75:48 - we want the hill to be in the middle so
75:52 - go to zero zero and then go backwards 10
75:55 - layers so it's on the very back
75:58 - and I think this is fine and then we can
76:01 - just drag this back inside of the
76:03 - winning receive play
76:05 - and let's see how it looks
76:08 - so the hills in the correct position
76:10 - all right
76:12 - and now I think the only thing missing
76:14 - is the number counter or the score
76:16 - counter
76:17 - so let's go to the score counter
76:20 - and let's see
76:22 - let's change the winner received play to
76:25 - when I receive start countdown
76:27 - so pretty much the score counter creates
76:30 - all of its clones and then the Clones
76:31 - show and stuff like that when the score
76:33 - starts counting down or the countdown
76:36 - Sprite starts counting down sorry so
76:38 - yeah let's try it out now oh yeah and we
76:41 - also need to hide our you lose screen
76:44 - and retry button when the countdown
76:46 - starts so let's go to our you lose
76:48 - Sprite
76:50 - and change the play to start countdown
76:54 - and do the same thing for retry button
76:57 - change the whenever receive play to when
76:59 - I receive start countdown
77:02 - all right let's try it again now there's
77:04 - the countdown
77:05 - and then the game starts
77:07 - all right cool let's try it again
77:11 - there's the countdown
77:12 - and then the game starts
77:15 - all right so the countdown now works
77:18 - when the green flag is clicked however
77:20 - the countdown does not work yet when the
77:22 - retype button is clicked and that is
77:25 - because for the retry button
77:27 - when the button is clicked it broadcasts
77:30 - play but we need to change that to
77:32 - countdown or start countdown so
77:35 - when the mouse is down then broadcast
77:37 - start countdown all right let's try it
77:39 - again
77:40 - so countdown and then let's just say we
77:43 - lose the game then we try
77:45 - and then there's the countdown
77:47 - all right cool so we added the countdown
77:51 - and the countdown seems to work
77:54 - all right but however we still need to
77:56 - fix the problem with the loose screen
77:58 - because the Clones are disappearing so
78:01 - to prevent the clones from deleting when
78:03 - the loose screen starts up let's move
78:04 - the delete this clone into the when I
78:08 - receive start countdown not after when I
78:10 - receive lose
78:12 - so let's first go to our pipes
78:14 - and then where it says delete this clone
78:18 - inside of the when I receive lose let's
78:20 - change this to
78:22 - when I receive start countdown
78:24 - and then delete this clone
78:27 - and same thing for the Hills
78:30 - so instead of the delete this clone
78:32 - inside of the window receive lose we
78:35 - drag a we're actually in here whenever C
78:38 - star countdown then delete this clone
78:42 - all right let's try it now
78:44 - so there's a countdown
78:45 - then let's lose the game
78:48 - and now as you can see the pipes show up
78:50 - and the hill shows up and for some
78:52 - reason our retry button is in the back
78:54 - over here so I'm just going to make it
78:58 - go to the front layer
79:01 - when the lose is received all right
79:05 - let's try it again
79:07 - countdown and then lose the game
79:09 - and then there we go now we have a fully
79:13 - functioning loose screen
79:14 - cool so let me just try it out
79:17 - it's like this
79:20 - and then when the game is lost then
79:22 - essentially everything pauses and it's
79:24 - all good all right so now I sort of
79:27 - wanted to add a bird knockback animation
79:30 - when the game loses for example when the
79:33 - bird crashes into the pipe the bird sort
79:35 - of jumps backwards like that so I'm
79:38 - going to add that let's uh go to the
79:41 - bird Sprite
79:42 - and then since we want the bird to do
79:45 - its animation when the game is lost
79:47 - let's grab a when I receive lose
79:51 - then uh let's make the bird sort of jump
79:54 - so we want to of course
79:57 - change the or actually set the change in
80:00 - y
80:02 - a to let's say seven
80:04 - now we want to go to control and then
80:07 - grab a repeat until block
80:10 - put it after the change in y to seven
80:13 - and then let's repeat until the bird is
80:16 - lower than the bottom edge of the screen
80:18 - so repeat until
80:21 - the Y position is less than
80:24 - uh what is it I think I have it over
80:26 - here oh yeah negative 171
80:31 - all right
80:32 - drag this inside of the repeat until
80:35 - and then after the bird is lower than
80:38 - negative 171 in the Y position
80:41 - then it's going to hide so drag the hide
80:43 - after the repeat until
80:46 - and then while it's still greater than
80:48 - negative 171 then we want it to
80:52 - um just duplicate this so change y by
80:55 - change in y drag inside of the repeat
80:58 - until
80:59 - and then we want to also make sure the
81:02 - change in y is decreasing
81:04 - so also copy this one
81:06 - change change in y by negative 0.8
81:10 - and then drag this inside of the
81:12 - repeating two
81:14 - all right so let's try it out
81:16 - so when the bird crashes into the pipe
81:20 - then it sort of jumps like that all
81:23 - right I think I'm gonna make the bird
81:25 - also go backwards a bit so let's go to
81:28 - motion and then drag a change X by let's
81:33 - say
81:34 - negative one
81:37 - that's drag it in there
81:39 - and let's try it out
81:41 - oops okay and our bird is hidden that is
81:44 - because I hit it over here but then I do
81:47 - not show it again when the game starts
81:49 - so let's go to looks and then grab a
81:51 - show
81:52 - drag it after the when I receive start
81:55 - countdown
81:56 - all right let's try it again
81:58 - there's the bird
82:01 - when it hits the pipe
82:03 - then it does that all right cool let's
82:06 - see it again
82:09 - the bird when it hits the pipe let's say
82:11 - here
82:12 - it sort of jumps backwards
82:14 - all right
82:15 - um and I'm also going to make sure that
82:17 - the bird points in direction of 90
82:20 - degrees when the game starts all right
82:23 - and I think it works
82:29 - so let's see um oh yeah I realized that
82:32 - the score does not reset until the start
82:35 - countdown finishes but we want the score
82:37 - to reset when you start countdown begins
82:40 - so let's see where the score is set oh
82:43 - right here all right and let's actually
82:46 - set the score
82:47 - when I receive start countdown all right
82:51 - now the score resets to zero when the
82:54 - start countdown begins and it should be
82:55 - fine
82:58 - all right cool
82:59 - like this
83:03 - okay
83:06 - and now I sort of remember seeing some
83:08 - bugs when I was play testing this game
83:11 - so let me just try to find them
83:13 - um let's see
83:18 - um oh yeah
83:20 - right there um when you press retry
83:23 - before the bird is finished falling
83:26 - it sort of doesn't work like that
83:27 - because the bird is still falling so
83:30 - let's go to our bird
83:32 - and let's see
83:35 - it stops all other scripts in the Sprite
83:38 - so let's put it before everything over
83:40 - here and that is because when the game
83:42 - restarts while the bird is still falling
83:45 - then the bird is going to keep on
83:47 - falling so we need to make sure that we
83:49 - stop the falling bird Sprite or script
83:52 - and then it should work all right let's
83:55 - try it again
83:57 - so when the bird is falling and then
83:59 - click retry
84:01 - then it works
84:05 - let's see I remember seeing something
84:07 - else that was a problem
84:09 - um I think it was the pipes so let's see
84:16 - um
84:21 - okay I don't see anything right now
84:29 - hmm
84:34 - okay that's a problem so I think when
84:37 - you press retry right after the bird
84:39 - dies then it doesn't work so let's try
84:42 - it
84:43 - oops okay it's right here so I'm just
84:46 - gonna spam click this
84:49 - and then yeah the game doesn't really
84:51 - work
84:52 - so let's see how I can fix this
84:55 - um
84:57 - see it again
85:00 - all right
85:01 - so that just stops working
85:05 - so I think the best way to fix this is
85:09 - to just go to the retry button
85:11 - and then adding a weight let's say 0.1
85:16 - seconds
85:17 - before it runs the code about the
85:20 - touching the mouse pointer and stuff
85:21 - like that
85:22 - so I think this should fix it let me
85:25 - just try it again
85:29 - all right that fixes it
85:31 - so when I click it super rapidly
85:33 - there's no more
85:35 - um weird pipe issues
85:37 - so that's fine
85:40 - all right cool so I think I fixed all of
85:43 - the bugs for now
85:45 - um now I'm going to create a simple menu
85:47 - screen so first of all I need to create
85:49 - a menu button so let's
85:52 - um just duplicate this retry button
85:56 - and then let's go to costumes
86:00 - and I'm going to change this to menu
86:05 - and that should be fun
86:07 - all right so now I'm going to position
86:09 - this
86:11 - downwards a bit
86:13 - maybe right here
86:19 - all right so I'm just going to drag this
86:22 - go to x y
86:24 - let's say after the when I receive lose
86:28 - and for the retry button
86:30 - I'm going to do the same
86:32 - so
86:34 - go to zero zero
86:36 - all right
86:37 - so now I have the retry and menu button
86:40 - so when I click the menu button
86:43 - I want it to broadcast a new message
86:46 - and let's just name this menu
86:49 - when we click the menu button we want it
86:52 - to actually go to the menu so let's go
86:55 - to stage
86:57 - and then I'm going to create a new
86:59 - backdrop
87:02 - and this is going to be my menu backdrop
87:05 - and for now I'm just going to create a
87:08 - rectangle
87:09 - that's
87:11 - the color white
87:13 - or actually a light blue works too
87:17 - it's like this
87:19 - all right
87:23 - a bit wider
87:26 - okay
87:27 - and then I'm just gonna add some text
87:30 - saying menu
87:37 - and
87:39 - this should be fine for now
87:42 - all right so now in our stage we want to
87:46 - make sure that when it receives menu
87:49 - so an event when I receive menu
87:53 - then we want to switch backdrop to
87:55 - backdrop 2 which is the menu backdrop
87:58 - and then when I receive
88:03 - um start countdown which is the game
88:06 - starting with the countdown text
88:09 - then we want to switch backdrop to
88:10 - backdrop one which is our game
88:12 - background
88:14 - so yeah right now it should work with
88:16 - just the background change
88:21 - all right and then menu
88:22 - and like that the menu changes however
88:25 - if we go to the menu we want everything
88:27 - else to disappear so let's go to the
88:31 - Sprites one by one and then make sure
88:32 - the High when they receive menu
88:34 - so let's first go to the bird
88:38 - all right so let's go to events
88:42 - when I receive menu
88:44 - then you want to hide
88:47 - and then
88:48 - go to control or actually events or
88:51 - sorry control and then
88:54 - stop other scripts in Sprite
88:57 - all right so this ensures that nothing
88:59 - else in the chicken Sprite is going to
89:01 - run
89:02 - and that should be fine
89:04 - now let's drag this into also our pipe
89:07 - Sprite
89:10 - and let's add a delete this clone at the
89:13 - end
89:13 - to make sure all the Clones are gone and
89:17 - then drag this into our Hill Sprite
89:20 - all right drag this into our number
89:23 - counter Sprite
89:26 - also our loose screen
89:29 - however we don't need this delete this
89:31 - clone since there are no clones in this
89:33 - blue screen
89:35 - and we also don't need this stop other
89:38 - scripts in Sprite since there are no
89:40 - Loops in here so it's fine
89:43 - and let's go to let's say our number
89:46 - counter and then drag this into our
89:49 - retry buttons right
89:51 - let's take out the delete this clone
89:53 - because there are no clones in this
89:55 - Sprite
89:57 - and
89:58 - I think this should be fine oh yeah also
90:01 - the menu button
90:03 - all right
90:05 - and it should be good let's try it out
90:08 - count down and then lose the game then
90:10 - menu
90:11 - oh yeah this is another bug when you
90:13 - lose the game right win a pipe is
90:16 - spawned then the pipe still uh moves
90:20 - because the stop other scripts in Sprite
90:23 - is called right before the pipe starts
90:26 - moving so yeah I am going to fix this in
90:30 - the next part of the series though but
90:32 - anyways let's go back to
90:35 - looking at the menu so let's try it
90:37 - again
90:39 - when the bird loses then menu
90:42 - then as you can see everything hides and
90:44 - we are at the menu so now on the menu
90:46 - screen we want a play button so to do
90:49 - that let's just copy the menu button
90:53 - and let's go to costumes change this to
90:56 - play
90:58 - or actually start
91:02 - and then let's go to the code
91:04 - and let's see
91:06 - in the when I receive menu we want the
91:09 - button to show
91:12 - and actually do all this stuff so we
91:15 - just take this out and then change the
91:18 - loose to menu
91:19 - and it should be fine
91:21 - and then when the mouse is down
91:24 - we want the start button to broadcast
91:27 - play or actually start countdown
91:30 - and then that should be fine
91:32 - um let's see
91:35 - all right and when I receive start
91:37 - countdown we want the start button to
91:39 - hide
91:41 - and also
91:43 - to
91:44 - stop
91:46 - other scripts in the Sprite
91:49 - oh actually oh we already have it here
91:50 - so it's fine yep that's good
91:54 - and I think we should be good
91:57 - so let's try it out
92:00 - oops okay everything is gone
92:02 - or actually the hills and that's because
92:04 - I need to make sure
92:06 - I show The Hills when the start
92:09 - countdown is received like that all
92:13 - right let's try it out
92:14 - okay
92:17 - then when the bird crashed the pipe and
92:20 - then menu
92:21 - then there's our start button all right
92:24 - and then when we press start
92:26 - then there's our countdown
92:28 - okay everything seems normal
92:32 - and everything seems to work
92:36 - now I'm just going to reposition the
92:37 - start button to maybe the middle over
92:40 - here
92:42 - so right here
92:44 - that is y position 23
92:48 - all right and
92:51 - this should be good
92:54 - menu and then menu all right now since
92:57 - we have a menu when the green flag is
92:59 - clicked we don't want it to start the
93:01 - game but we want it to go to the menu
93:04 - so instead of broadcasting start
93:06 - countdown we want to broadcast menu
93:10 - and now it should be fine so when the
93:13 - green flag is clicked
93:14 - it shows a menu
93:16 - and then we can start
93:18 - all right and our game works like normal
93:23 - and then when the bird crashes it shows
93:26 - the animation and then we can retry
93:31 - and we can also go to the menu
93:34 - all right so there we have it we have
93:36 - our basic menu we have a working retry
93:39 - button and blue screen and we also added
93:42 - some countdown text
93:47 - this is part five on how to make a
93:49 - Flappy Bird game in scratch and in this
93:51 - video I am going to make the menu look
93:53 - better at some sound effects fix some
93:55 - bugs and re-explain all the code in the
93:58 - project anyways let's get started so the
94:01 - first thing I want to fix before I do
94:02 - anything else is that I forgot to make
94:05 - it so that you can't hold the mouse
94:07 - button because right now
94:09 - when you hold the mouse button the bird
94:11 - sort of floats up and we don't want that
94:14 - because we only want the bird to jump
94:17 - once when you tap the button and if you
94:20 - hold the button the bird still only
94:21 - jumps once so that's what we want so to
94:24 - do that we just actually have to go to
94:26 - control
94:27 - and then grab a wait until block go to
94:30 - operators grab a knot
94:33 - and then go to sensing
94:36 - and then grab a mouse down
94:38 - and let's drag this after the set change
94:41 - in y and point in Direction inside of
94:43 - the if Mouse down
94:45 - and now what this does is that after you
94:47 - hold the mouse button down it runs the
94:50 - set change in y and point in Direction
94:52 - and then you have to release the mouse
94:54 - pointer before running this again so now
94:57 - this prevents the player from holding
94:59 - down the mouse button however we can't
95:01 - put this if Mouse down inside of this
95:03 - forever Loop anymore because while it's
95:06 - waiting for not Mouse down then nothing
95:08 - else would run so we want to separate
95:10 - this if Mouse down from the forever Loop
95:13 - and then let's just go to events
95:16 - grab a separate when I receive play and
95:20 - then grab a further loop from the
95:21 - control
95:23 - and then drag this if Mouse down stuff
95:25 - inside of the forever Loop
95:28 - all right now let's try it out
95:32 - all right
95:33 - and then if I try holding
95:36 - then the bird still jumps like normal
95:39 - let me try it again
95:41 - like this if I hold then the bird still
95:44 - only jumps once
95:46 - all right cool
95:48 - so we fixed that problem
95:52 - and something else that may happen when
95:54 - you play the game is that when you lose
95:56 - the game right when another clone of the
95:59 - pipe spawns the cloned pipe keeps moving
96:02 - normally across the screen instead of
96:05 - freezing so let's go to the pipes to see
96:08 - what's wrong
96:10 - um
96:12 - let's see what can we fix in here
96:16 - okay let me first try to recreate the
96:18 - bug so I have to crash into the pipe
96:21 - right when a new pipe spawns
96:24 - okay that was a bit too late
96:26 - let me try it again
96:30 - okay A bit too early now
96:33 - uh let me see
96:37 - okay still a bit too early
96:40 - um
96:43 - okay A bit too late now
96:50 - all right so I managed to get the bug
96:53 - and as you can see the newly spawned
96:55 - pipe keeps scrolling through the screen
96:57 - and we don't want that so let's go to
97:00 - our pipes now
97:02 - and I think what happens is that
97:06 - um
97:07 - the pipe creates a clone at the exact
97:10 - same time that the bird loses and then
97:14 - it's supposed to stop all other scripts
97:16 - in the Sprite
97:17 - but it doesn't stop the create clone of
97:20 - myself because it's the exact same time
97:22 - and then that ends up the newly created
97:25 - clone not stopping all of its scripts
97:28 - and then keep on going
97:30 - so that's the problem I think so to fix
97:33 - that we have to create a new variable
97:37 - and then I'll just call this
97:41 - uh
97:42 - lost
97:45 - and then yep click ok
97:49 - and when the flag is clicked
97:52 - or actually when I receive
97:56 - um play
97:59 - or actually start countdown
98:01 - let's set lost to no
98:05 - and then once the bird crashes into the
98:08 - pipe then we want to set loss to yes
98:11 - so let's go to the bird
98:15 - and then right here in the if touching
98:18 - Sprite 2 which is the pipe
98:20 - then we want to
98:22 - set lost to yes
98:25 - and then do all this all right now let's
98:28 - go back to our pipe
98:30 - and in the Clone over pipe we want to
98:33 - make sure that the pipe only moves if
98:36 - lost is equal to no otherwise we want
98:38 - the pipe to pause so let's go to control
98:41 - grab an if statement
98:43 - and then go to operators grab an equals
98:46 - and then go to variables grab a lost
98:49 - and then check if lost is equal to no
98:53 - then do all of this stuff inside of the
98:55 - repeat until
98:57 - oops I'm going to make sure that I also
98:59 - get the set size to 150 in there
99:04 - all right
99:05 - so let's try it out
99:07 - I'm going to try to make sure the bird
99:09 - loses right when the pipe spawns to see
99:11 - if the problem is fixed
99:14 - all right I'm gonna go to Project view
99:16 - so it's a bit easier
99:17 - and let's try it
99:19 - so
99:21 - let me make sure that the pipe just
99:23 - spawns
99:25 - okay that was a bit too late I think
99:30 - okay A bit too early now
99:36 - okay A bit too early again
99:39 - I think I need to be like one frame
99:41 - later
99:42 - okay that was too late
99:47 - okay so I can't recreate the exact
99:50 - problem that we used to have but I'm
99:52 - pretty sure the problem is fixed so
99:54 - let's go back inside of the project
99:58 - and okay
99:59 - let me first reposition the loose screen
100:02 - I think I accidentally dragged it so
100:04 - I'll just drag it go to zero zero
100:08 - um after the when I receive moves
100:11 - all right
100:12 - and now that I think all of the bugs are
100:16 - fixed I'm going to create a better
100:18 - looking menu
100:21 - [Music]
100:33 - all right so I am done with the menu and
100:37 - I separated the title into a new Sprite
100:41 - so instead of putting it inside of the
100:43 - backdrop I made it its own separate
100:46 - Sprite and that's because I want the
100:48 - title to maybe move around a bit so yeah
100:51 - and I also added some
100:53 - um sun rays and I made these a separate
100:56 - Sprite also because I'm gonna add some
100:58 - ghost effect because I want the Rays to
101:01 - be transparent so yeah anyways I made
101:04 - the button look a bit better and added
101:07 - some hills in the background and yeah
101:09 - all right so I'm gonna first go to the
101:12 - Sunbeam Sprite and then I'm going to go
101:15 - to a control or actually event and then
101:17 - drag a when I receive menu
101:21 - then I'm going to go to looks
101:23 - and then I'm going to set the ghost
101:26 - effect to maybe let's try 50.
101:31 - all right
101:33 - um let's try 40.
101:35 - maybe 30
101:38 - not like 40 better all right and then
101:40 - I'm also going to make them go
101:43 - to the back so go to back layer
101:47 - all right and I think they look better
101:50 - and now for the title
101:53 - I am also going to drag a when I receive
101:56 - menu
101:59 - then I think I'm going to make the title
102:01 - go up and down by a tiny bit so I'm
102:04 - going to
102:07 - um I guess grab a repeat
102:09 - and then I'm going to repeat maybe 10
102:11 - times
102:12 - and I'm going to change y by let's say
102:19 - 0.5
102:21 - and then I'm going to duplicate this
102:24 - and then change y by negative 0.5
102:28 - and let's see how this looks
102:30 - all right so it goes up and down like
102:32 - that
102:34 - okay so I think we can repeat this
102:38 - so let's go to control and then grab a
102:40 - farther Loop and put this around the two
102:43 - repeats
102:44 - and the C
102:47 - and it jumps up and down like that all
102:49 - right
102:51 - um also I'm going to grab a win I
102:54 - receive
102:56 - uh start countdown
102:58 - then I am going to
103:03 - hide the Sprite and then stop all other
103:06 - scripts in the Sprite so in control
103:10 - and then stop other scripts in Sprite
103:13 - and also for my uh sunbeams I'm going to
103:17 - do the same thing so when I receive
103:19 - start countdown
103:20 - then hide
103:22 - and we don't need the stop other scripts
103:25 - in the Sprite because there are no Loops
103:28 - in here so we're fine
103:29 - all right let's see
103:31 - and okay our title is gone and we have
103:35 - to reshow it so let's drag a show after
103:38 - the when I received menu
103:41 - and also a show for the sun beams
103:45 - that should be good
103:46 - all right let's try it out
103:49 - so there's the bouncing title and when
103:51 - we press start
103:53 - then the game starts as normal
103:56 - all right cool
104:00 - so I think this is going to be our title
104:03 - screen now
104:04 - and let's see
104:06 - okay and now I'm going to make some
104:09 - changes to the you lose screen
104:14 - [Music]
104:24 - all right so this is going to be our you
104:26 - loose screen and for the retry and menu
104:29 - buttons I am going to take out the ghost
104:32 - effect so I'm going to set it back to
104:34 - zero so it's fully visible all right
104:38 - and that should look better
104:41 - okay
104:42 - so now we have our updated loose screen
104:47 - so let's see it again
104:51 - and our loose green right here
104:55 - and lastly I am going to now add some
104:57 - sound effects
104:59 - so let's see of course we want a
105:02 - flapping sound effect for our bird
105:04 - so let's go to our bird and then let's
105:06 - go to sounds
105:08 - and now let's create a new sound
105:10 - we can actually choose the sound
105:13 - so the scratch 3.0 editor has a great
105:15 - selection of sounds you can choose from
105:17 - like all of these so I'm going to try to
105:20 - find some maybe flapping sound let me
105:23 - search it up
105:24 - flap okay nothing let me go to effects
105:28 - all right so low whoosh sounds pretty
105:31 - good it sounds like this
105:35 - so let's select this
105:37 - and I'm going to first trim this so
105:40 - let's click this trim tool over here
105:42 - and I'm just going to trim
105:44 - this much of it
105:46 - and then click save
105:48 - and now let's see
105:51 - I might make it slower
105:54 - okay A bit slower
105:59 - okay I think that's fine for now
106:02 - so let's go back to our code
106:04 - and to add the sound it's really easy
106:07 - all we need to do is in our if Mouse
106:10 - down
106:11 - we just want to go to sound and then add
106:14 - a play sound low whoosh so let's put
106:17 - this right after
106:19 - and that should be fine so let's try it
106:21 - out
106:23 - now when the bird flaps
106:26 - there's the low whoosh sound
106:31 - all right cool
106:33 - so I think that sounds pretty good and
106:35 - oh yeah we don't want the sound to play
106:37 - when we're selecting a button though
106:40 - like
106:43 - if we click retry then the sound still
106:45 - plays and we don't want that so let's
106:48 - see
106:51 - um
106:53 - I think in our when I received lose
106:58 - we can go to control and then grab a
107:01 - stop other scripts in the Sprite
107:04 - and let's put it right after it receives
107:06 - lose
107:07 - so this is where the bird sort of jumps
107:09 - back when it like hits a pipe or
107:11 - something so yeah now let's try it out
107:16 - okay
107:18 - and then when it loses
107:21 - there is no more sound
107:23 - and all right it works
107:27 - so our flapping sound works for the bird
107:30 - oops
107:31 - and that should be fine
107:33 - all right so I think I also want a
107:36 - button sound so when we hover over it
107:38 - there's the sort of button click sound
107:41 - effect or something like that
107:43 - so let's see
107:45 - um let's go to sounds again
107:47 - and let's try to find the sound alright
107:49 - so I found a good sound it's called wood
107:52 - tap
107:53 - sounds like this
107:57 - so I think this is going to be when we
107:59 - hover over the button
108:02 - let's see I might make it slower
108:10 - actually this is fine so yeah let's
108:12 - leave it like that okay this is fine now
108:15 - let's go back to the code
108:17 - and in all of our buttons we want to add
108:21 - that would tap sound
108:22 - and okay I think I accidentally added
108:24 - that to the loose screen so oops
108:27 - but we can just drop this sound into our
108:30 - buttons like that
108:32 - so let's do that
108:34 - and in our buttons
108:37 - we can now add this when it's touching
108:39 - the mouse pointer so let's go to sound
108:42 - and then add the start sound
108:46 - would tap
108:48 - let's place this after the if touching
108:50 - Mouse pointer or actually let's not do
108:53 - that because it won't work because since
108:55 - this if statement is constantly checking
108:58 - if it's touching the mouse pointer the
109:00 - sound would constantly play so we don't
109:02 - want that we only want the sound to play
109:04 - once when the mouse enters the button
109:06 - area
109:07 - so let's grab a separate event when I
109:11 - receive lose
109:13 - and then let's grab a forever Loop
109:16 - and we can just grab an if statement and
109:20 - then check if it's touching the mouse
109:22 - pointer
109:23 - then we want to start the sound wood tap
109:26 - and then let's go to control
109:28 - and wait until
109:31 - it's not touching the mouse pointer
109:35 - and now that should be fine so this
109:37 - ensures that the sound only plays once
109:39 - when the mouse pointer enters
109:41 - so let's try it out that is for the
109:44 - retry button so let's go to the retry
109:46 - button
109:50 - and then as you can see
109:52 - the button sound plays
109:57 - all right so let's do the same thing for
110:01 - the menu button let's just drag this
110:03 - inside of the menu Sprite or menu button
110:06 - Sprite
110:08 - and then that should be fine because the
110:11 - menu button Sprite has almost the same
110:13 - code as the retry button Sprite so we're
110:15 - good now let's drag this into our start
110:17 - button
110:19 - okay and then instead of when I receive
110:22 - lose we want this to be when I receive
110:24 - menu
110:25 - now let's try it out
110:29 - okay there's your start button Sprite
110:34 - and okay
110:36 - [Laughter]
110:40 - so this works fine like that
110:43 - however first thing I noticed was that
110:46 - the countdown Sprite showed on the menu
110:49 - so we want to go to events drag a winner
110:52 - receive
110:54 - menu
110:55 - then we want to hide the countdown
110:56 - Sprite
110:58 - all right
111:00 - and a second thing that I noticed was
111:02 - that when the game starts
111:04 - you can still hover over the menu button
111:07 - Sprite because it's still there
111:10 - so let's go to our start button in our
111:13 - menu
111:15 - and let's see
111:17 - oh yeah we have to make sure that when
111:20 - the start button is clicked we want to
111:22 - also
111:24 - um stop other scripts in the Sprite
111:27 - including the button sound effect so
111:31 - yeah that's why this was playing because
111:33 - this forever Loop was still going
111:36 - so now that we added the stop other
111:38 - scripts in Sprite it stops everything in
111:41 - the start button Sprite all right let's
111:43 - try it again
111:45 - so there's our sound effect
111:47 - and okay
111:49 - um let's see
111:51 - oh yeah okay so the stop other scripts
111:54 - in Sprite also stopped this
111:56 - so let's just drag this hide inside of
111:58 - the if Mouse down
112:01 - and that should be fine all right
112:04 - and there we go
112:09 - okay
112:13 - oh and I think the same thing for the
112:15 - mini button
112:16 - so we want to stop other scripts in the
112:19 - Sprite
112:20 - for the menu button and let's also drag
112:24 - the hide inside of the if Mouse down
112:27 - instead of the start countdown
112:31 - and let's check the retry button
112:34 - okay same thing so drag a stop I'll
112:37 - description Sprite
112:40 - and that should be fine oh yeah let's
112:43 - drag the hide inside of the if Mouse
112:46 - down
112:47 - and let's try it again
112:50 - okay
112:54 - all right
112:57 - okay our menu button is still there
112:59 - so let's see oh yeah we still have to
113:02 - include the when I receive start
113:04 - countdown because when we restart the
113:07 - game we still have to hide the menu
113:09 - button so yep my bad let's drag this
113:12 - back
113:13 - let's also drag this inside of the retry
113:15 - button Sprite
113:17 - just in case
113:18 - and that should be fine all right
113:27 - okay
113:29 - the money button is still
113:31 - running okay to fix this we have to go
113:35 - to
113:37 - um control
113:39 - and then stop other scripts in the
113:41 - Sprite win start countdown is received
113:45 - and that should be fine
113:47 - let's do the same thing for the retry
113:49 - button
113:50 - so stop other scripts in Sprite
113:52 - when start countdown is received and now
113:55 - let's try it again
113:57 - okay
114:01 - all right no more
114:03 - button tapping sound effects in the game
114:07 - I mean when the game starts
114:15 - all right
114:24 - and I think that works Okay cool so we
114:27 - have the button sound effect down
114:31 - and now I think I'm going to add a sound
114:34 - effect to when the bird passes a pipe
114:37 - maybe some like
114:38 - high pitched ding sound effect or maybe
114:41 - a bell or something
114:42 - so let's try to find that
114:44 - um let's see
114:46 - let's go to our
114:48 - uh pipe
114:51 - let's see
114:54 - yep so let's go to sounds now and I'm
114:58 - going to find the sound okay I found the
115:01 - sound effect and it's this sort of coin
115:04 - sound effect
115:05 - like that
115:07 - so let's add this
115:10 - and I'm just going to trim this to here
115:14 - and I might make this higher pitched
115:17 - let's see
115:20 - foreign
115:23 - yeah I think a higher pitch sounds
115:25 - better
115:29 - okay and now this is going to be our
115:32 - score increase sound effect so let's go
115:36 - to our code
115:38 - and right in here when the bird passes
115:41 - the position of the pipes
115:43 - then we want to go to sounds and then
115:46 - start the sound of the coin
115:49 - all right let's try it out
115:57 - all right there it is
116:02 - okay
116:04 - that seems pretty good let's try it
116:06 - again
116:11 - all right and one more sound effect I
116:13 - think I will add is uh when the bird
116:17 - crashes into the pipe
116:19 - we sort of need some bump sound effect
116:21 - so let's go to our bird Sprite and then
116:25 - I will find a sound
116:28 - alright so there weren't any small
116:30 - bumping sound effects but I think
116:32 - beatbox one will do so it's like this
116:40 - so I think I'm gonna only use the first
116:43 - part of the sound effect
116:45 - so when it does this
116:48 - okay so right around here so I'm going
116:51 - to trim about this much of it let's try
116:53 - it
116:55 - okay A bit more
116:58 - or here
117:11 - all right so I think this much is fine
117:13 - I'm going to save this
117:17 - all right
117:18 - and let's drag the sound into when the
117:22 - bird crashes into the pipe
117:25 - so right here
117:27 - let's drag the start sound
117:31 - of beatbox one inside of the if touching
117:34 - Sprite 2 which is the pipe or if the Y
117:37 - position is less than negative 171.
117:40 - all right let's try it out
117:48 - okay that sounds pretty good let's try
117:51 - it again
117:52 - when it falls off
117:54 - okay I think that's good and of course
117:57 - you can record your own sound effects if
117:59 - you want you can also find them online
118:01 - there's some good sites where you can
118:03 - download some free sound effects but
118:06 - anyways that's pretty much it so I'm
118:09 - just going to do some more playthroughs
118:11 - of the game
118:12 - so does the menu
118:15 - okay I'm going to go to the project page
118:18 - all right
118:19 - so this is the menu
118:21 - we have our start
118:25 - this is our gameplay
118:37 - all right
118:45 - let's crash into the pipe
118:48 - foreign
118:51 - okay
118:53 - let me retry
118:59 - okay
119:01 - let's go back
119:02 - and let's start again
119:13 - of course you can make the game Harder
119:15 - by decreasing the space between the
119:17 - pipes
119:19 - all right
119:26 - oops that was some lag right there
119:31 - but yeah anyways that's the entire game
119:33 - anyways that's it for this video and
119:36 - that's it for this entire series
