00:00 - there's no such thing as lossless
00:01 - compression with human communication put
00:04 - that on a clip Quincy you should clip
00:05 - that put that out there all right we
00:07 - don't have clips for Clips sake we just
00:09 - want to give you a taste and say oh
00:11 - that's interesting and then come listen
00:12 - to the full conversation so
00:16 - [Music]
00:38 - welcome back to the freeco camp podcast
00:41 - I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and founder
00:44 - of freeco camp.org each week we're
00:47 - bringing you Insight from developers
00:49 - Founders and ambitious people getting
00:50 - into Tech this week we're joined by
00:53 - Jared Santo he's a software engineer and
00:56 - host of Chang log podcast in the Chang
01:00 - log News podcast which is newer and
01:03 - which I listen to pretty much every week
01:05 - uh so Jared
01:08 - welcome excited to be here Quincy thanks
01:10 - for having me yeah man I'm excited to
01:12 - have you back on so for any of you
01:14 - hardcore freeo Camp podcast listeners
01:17 - you may remember that hey didn't fre C
01:19 - Camp do a comprehensive interview with
01:21 - Jared and with his his uh with Adam his
01:24 - partner in crime over there at change
01:26 - log uh and yes I did uh it's like a
01:29 - really comprehensive ensive interview uh
01:31 - episode number 85 I believe so be sure
01:33 - to check that and that contains a lot of
01:35 - Jared's origin story as a developer so
01:38 - we're we're going to be able to kind of
01:39 - jump right past a lot of that and jump
01:40 - into like what's new because that was
01:42 - four years ago uh but before we do just
01:45 - a very quick highlevel explanation Jared
01:48 - of uh who you are what you do and why
01:52 - people like me are listening to you
01:53 - every single week and uh real quick for
01:55 - anybody watching the video for anybody
01:58 - watching the video it may look super
02:00 - dark it's just like storming like crazy
02:01 - outside I haven't heard any T tornado
02:03 - sirens or anything like that uh so
02:06 - hopefully Mother Nature cooperates and
02:08 - we can just uh record this without issue
02:11 - but I just want to let you know that I'm
02:12 - okay I'm not like turning into like a
02:14 - vampire or anything like it's just super
02:16 - dark even though it's like 9:00 am
02:19 - outside yeah
02:21 - Jared all right well thanks for having
02:23 - me always awesome I do recall that deep
02:26 - dive we did I think we all got together
02:28 - in the same room even yes and spent a
02:31 - day at Adam's house you interviewed us
02:33 - for multiple hours we interviewed you
02:36 - for multiple hours and we put out
02:38 - simultaneous shows because it was our
02:39 - 10th anniversary it was your fifth
02:40 - anniversary at free code camp and that
02:43 - was really exciting the nice thing about
02:44 - getting the origin story out of the way
02:46 - you know a lot of times the second
02:48 - superhero movie is better because you
02:49 - don't have to do all that where how did
02:51 - he get here kind of stuff so we can skip
02:53 - past all that it has been 5 years since
02:55 - we last talked I think we're doing
02:58 - mostly the same things that we were
03:00 - doing when you spoke to us last time and
03:02 - hey so are you just like you know a
03:04 - different day still toiling away at
03:07 - trying to change the world one developer
03:09 - at a time we kind of both are doing the
03:10 - same thing different angles right on at
03:12 - that goal and uh still a huge fan of
03:15 - Freo camp and the work that youall are
03:16 - doing I've for a long time had a stock
03:19 - answer for anybody who comes to me and
03:21 - says how do I break into software
03:22 - development and I used to have a hard
03:24 - time answering that because there's a
03:25 - lot of a lot of yah buts and if this and
03:28 - that but now I'm just like
03:29 - freecodecamp.org see you later if you
03:32 - can get through that you'll be well on
03:33 - your way so I appreciate you providing
03:35 - me such an easy answer for folks who are
03:38 - looking to get started but yeah we just
03:39 - been podcasting man we're trying to put
03:41 - out good shows host great conversations
03:44 - keep people up to date with what's going
03:45 - on in the industry and uh trying to make
03:48 - a living doing it yeah well I am really
03:52 - excited to hear a little bit more about
03:54 - how you do that with Adam because you're
03:56 - based in near Omaha Nebraska in the The
04:01 - Once independent city of benington that
04:03 - has since been kind of like aized or
04:07 - what I don't know what verb to use but
04:09 - basically like cities creep outward this
04:12 - happens all the time in Texas and it
04:15 - sounds like Omaha kind of came over and
04:17 - kind of the amoeba that is uh Omaha kind
04:20 - of like swallowed up Bennington right so
04:24 - you're you're now kind of part of that
04:25 - metro area right yeah so Omaha hits up
04:28 - against the Missouri River on the East
04:30 - and so you know we're done growing that
04:31 - way you just can't grow across the river
04:33 - that's a whole different state over
04:34 - there and so Omaha just grows West and
04:37 - then North and a little bit South and it
04:39 - just kind of eats small towns until it
04:41 - becomes a metropolitan area eventually
04:44 - it'll con connect with linkoln which is
04:46 - actually the state capital of Nebraska
04:47 - it's about 45 minute drive on the
04:49 - interstate to Iowa or to Lincoln but
04:52 - eventually I think these two cities will
04:53 - become one giant City and we'll we'll
04:56 - start to look like we have some
04:57 - population numbers but we're still
04:58 - pretty small I mean Midwest so we're not
05:01 - talking New York style
05:03 - Orla well uh you are a resident of that
05:07 - you've lived out there as long as I've
05:09 - known you and something that's really
05:11 - cool about you that a lot of people may
05:13 - not realize you've got six freaking
05:16 - kids I that's a
05:19 - lot that is a lot it doesn't feel like a
05:21 - lot to me anymore even though I know
05:23 - that relative to most families that's a
05:25 - large
05:26 - family um yeah my youngest is five and
05:29 - my oldest just turned 16 so she's out on
05:32 - the uh on the streets now which is a
05:35 - whole different experience as a dad you
05:37 - know Steve
05:39 - around know that job's quote about like
05:41 - children and like it's the first time
05:43 - your heart it's an out of- Body
05:44 - Experience because your heart is out in
05:46 - the room walking around that's a
05:48 - paraphrase of Steve Jobs quote it's that
05:50 - but then when once they're driving it's
05:52 - like they're not walking around the room
05:53 - they're like driving around the city and
05:55 - it's a whole different terrifying
05:57 - experience I'm just getting to live that
05:59 - out for the the first time this year
06:02 - yeah wow yeah so uh I mean that's that's
06:07 - pretty good spread of Ages but like it's
06:09 - not like you accidentally had a kid when
06:11 - you were in like your late 40s and now
06:13 - you got to take care of I've got a lot
06:14 - of friends who are in that boat who they
06:16 - had two kids they thought they were done
06:17 - and then they accidentally had another
06:18 - one so the first thing I did after I
06:20 - have my second kid CU I was like Hey
06:22 - zero population growth achieved you know
06:25 - like I I've done my part on and I went
06:28 - and I got the procedure and now I don't
06:30 - have to worry about accidentally having
06:32 - kids but uh I don't know if you decided
06:34 - at some point to do that but uh sorry
06:37 - I'm not this is not a show where we pry
06:38 - into people's personal medical
06:40 - information it's all good man but I did
06:42 - volunteer that I did it and uh you did
06:46 - like it's all good I think that that is
06:49 - has got to be wild because it first of
06:51 - all it's got to cost a fortune to
06:53 - provide for six kids it it already cost
06:56 - me plenty just providing for two like it
06:59 - maybe you can talk a little bit about
07:00 - what your your day-to-day life is like
07:02 - and like the pressure you feel to be
07:04 - able to provide for a family like this
07:07 - is Brady Bunch sure right I don't think
07:09 - you have like the the living like you
07:11 - know obas on like the lady that lived
07:13 - you the alpar whatever it was the bunch
07:16 - but um but that's like like you're
07:18 - filling up that entire tic-tac-toe grid
07:20 - with family members right
07:23 - basically yeah I mean it's it's a lot
07:27 - you know we uh
07:29 - we don't really worry about it I mean
07:31 - that's just always been my stance so I'm
07:32 - a I'm a Christian guy I believe in God
07:34 - and Jesus Christ and all that and so you
07:36 - know I read the Bible the Bible talks
07:37 - about taking care of your base needs
07:39 - like don't worry about that stuff God
07:40 - will take care of it you go out and and
07:43 - pay attention to these things and just
07:44 - like it it'll be fine and you know I
07:46 - just kind of took that on as true and
07:48 - it's been true though so far in my life
07:50 - and it's served me very well so I don't
07:52 - really think too much about it there are
07:53 - times of course we had an economic
07:55 - downturn I'm sure you felt it I'm not
07:57 - sure you felt it at free code camp but
07:59 - you I'm sure you saw it we've had a lot
08:01 - of layoffs in our industry yeah um and
08:04 - you know we made less money last year
08:07 - way less money than we made the previous
08:09 - year and so that's a little bit scary
08:11 - but you know we were just fine and we
08:12 - just continue to be fine a large family
08:14 - is a cost burden you have to live your
08:17 - life different than most people we
08:19 - homeschool uh so we're at the house a
08:21 - lot but what people don't realize about
08:23 - kids is that they grow up and they
08:25 - become economic powerhouses of their own
08:27 - and actually a family is a huge huge
08:29 - economic Powerhouse once it's
08:31 - established and so we look at it kind of
08:33 - like long-term investing you know it's
08:35 - like the longest term investment you can
08:36 - put out there and actually pays huge
08:38 - dividends in the long run yeah yeah I
08:41 - mean like if you're if you're like kind
08:43 - of founding like a dynasty almost like a
08:45 - like a zatu like like you can have this
08:49 - uh entire kind of like you know station
08:52 - home and then you can have like all
08:53 - these satellite uh households with their
08:55 - own families and stuff like that and
08:57 - that's how like business worked
08:59 - historically the oldest businesses in
09:01 - the world are family businesses that
09:03 - have just passed been passed down from
09:05 - one generation to generation the skills
09:07 - have been transferred the actual assets
09:10 - of the business have been transferred
09:12 - and it just it's a continuation right
09:14 - and like I have profound respect for
09:16 - people who are able to to build that
09:18 - kind of like
09:19 - intergenerational momentum um that's a
09:22 - big part of the American dream in my
09:23 - opinion but it's not just the American
09:24 - dream I think a lot of cultures
09:27 - prioritize building out these robust
09:29 - families where there's some like if you
09:32 - don't have family and you fall on Hard
09:34 - Times that's really tough uh but as long
09:37 - as you have family and they're willing
09:38 - to like help and it just gives you a lot
09:41 - of like wiggle room or you know
09:44 - affordance uh for lack of a better word
09:46 - right so like I mean the pattern is a
09:49 - pattern that I believe in strongly is
09:51 - that the parents provide for the kids
09:53 - and then the kids grow up and then the
09:55 - kids provide for the parents and that's
09:56 - just the circle of life and I think a
09:58 - lot of people have not done that in
10:02 - America in the last 50 years where it's
10:03 - like the parents grow up the kids move
10:06 - out they go somewhere else and now
10:08 - hopefully Mom and Dad have enough
10:10 - retirement have enough Medicare whatever
10:13 - it is to take care of themselves to get
10:15 - into a home and sometimes that's the way
10:17 - it works out I'm not uh hitting on
10:18 - anybody for doing that but I think that
10:22 - because we provided for them everything
10:24 - that they needed in order to succeed in
10:25 - this life that it's not asking too much
10:27 - to in our old age for them to take care
10:29 - of of us and so I look at that as kind
10:31 - of a retirement in a certain sense it's
10:32 - not like I'm going to require it of them
10:34 - or or come over to their house and like
10:36 - say give me money but you know it's just
10:38 - the flow on a pattern that makes a lot
10:39 - of sense yeah I mean like my wife is
10:42 - from China we met in grad school and
10:44 - she's now a nationalized US citizen and
10:47 - like there's very much that like vibe in
10:49 - China that like the family is this big
10:52 - unit and uh as people age like they can
10:55 - move in and you have these
10:56 - multigenerational households and it's
10:58 - actually really good for the kids in my
10:59 - opinion that they're spending so much
11:01 - time with their grandparents and that uh
11:03 - that the the parents who are still in
11:05 - kind of like their their super
11:08 - productive years uh can can actually get
11:11 - some work done and not just totally
11:12 - focus on child rearing because they have
11:14 - the support of the the older generation
11:17 - yeah so and again like my experience is
11:20 - limited to just like being in the US
11:22 - being in China but I imagine a lot of
11:24 - other you know societies work like this
11:27 - and and I do think it is I mean we've
11:30 - had kind of like cautionary tale of like
11:32 - oh we can disassemble families and we
11:34 - can just you know the kids can go off
11:36 - and live in a different city and like
11:38 - you know every the parents go to the
11:40 - retirement homes and all that stuff like
11:41 - I I do think that that to some extent
11:43 - that is uh kind of uh you know a modern
11:47 - uh but retrograde some Modern uh in ter
11:51 - in terms of like you lose a lot when you
11:54 - kind of break break the family down into
11:56 - like different atoms like you're
11:57 - breaking the bonds and you're breaking
11:59 - people people out and right yeah yeah
12:02 - what you end up with unfortunately is a
12:04 - lot of very lonely elderly people there
12:06 - A lot of very lonely elderly people
12:08 - because their families aren't around so
12:09 - I do I agree with you that it's
12:11 - retrograde obviously uh Different
12:13 - Strokes for different folks but I think
12:15 - that that's a great way to live life and
12:19 - to be a family for life not just raise
12:22 - your kids till they're 18 and then you
12:24 - know wipe your hands clean boot them out
12:26 - the door go join the military see you
12:29 - yeah I'm done with you yeah no yeah uh
12:34 - well that's cool so again this is a
12:36 - podcast about software development and
12:38 - we're going to be talking about that I
12:39 - promise but I just wanted to get some
12:40 - insight into to Jared because you are
12:43 - the only person I know like I know tons
12:44 - of people my age who have two kids three
12:46 - kids even four kids but like six kids
12:49 - that's like that's like a serious
12:51 - undertaking and uh I just want to convey
12:54 - the profound amount of respect I have
12:55 - for you being able to uh to raise those
12:58 - kids and uh you know raise them well and
13:00 - not just you know let the kids run
13:03 - around crazily like like in the 70s and
13:05 - 80s it seemed like parents were just so
13:07 - hands off and there's been like that
13:09 - return to uh to like being a little bit
13:12 - more thoughtful about child rearing uh
13:14 - yeah again I don't want to slight like
13:16 - the previous generations and stuff for
13:18 - being lazy but like kidnappings way down
13:21 - you know kids getting hit car by cars
13:23 - way down you know kids uh just getting
13:26 - in Crazy accidents and being like
13:28 - permanently
13:29 - you know eating tons of medicine that
13:31 - used to happen all the time like there
13:33 - are so many kids who are walking around
13:35 - with like lifelong disabilities because
13:36 - they like ate an entire bottle of
13:37 - aspirin like you know uh or you know
13:40 - something like that like that sort of
13:42 - stuff used to happen all the time and
13:44 - life was cheap even here in the United
13:46 - States right like the the wealthiest
13:48 - place in the world it felt like life is
13:50 - cheap and you read about like how things
13:52 - were different in the 60s and70s then
13:53 - you get these old people like oh yeah we
13:54 - just let the kids do whatever let the
13:56 - kids be free I'm like no if you do that
13:58 - the kids are get an accident you're
13:59 - going to get killed um so like I'm much
14:02 - more of a Hands-On parent I don't know
14:03 - how you are but
14:06 - like I I just I think there's profound
14:08 - responsibility in having kids and I
14:10 - think that so many people like not
14:12 - everybody's cut out to be a good parent
14:14 - or they they could be a good parent but
14:16 - they need to actually like you know work
14:19 - at being a good parent it's not like
14:20 - humans are naturally good parents it's
14:22 - one of the hardest things you can do so
14:23 - you can't yeah you have to actually put
14:25 - the work in you have to try hard and uh
14:28 - I think 90% of parenting is just showing
14:30 - up and caring and I think most parents
14:32 - show up and care so a lot of us are
14:33 - doing really well I agree with you that
14:35 - we've kind of swung the other way from
14:37 - like parenting Styles this might tie
14:38 - back into our software conversation
14:40 - because we have kind of a correction and
14:43 - overcorrection uh culture in the in the
14:46 - West in modern times where we're like
14:48 - okay this was the way that they did it
14:50 - and I agree with you that a lot of
14:52 - especially my dad tells me stories of
14:53 - the way that he was raised and it was
14:55 - like he just basically was free roaming
14:57 - around the city of Omaha for days days
14:59 - at a time and like never saw his parents
15:00 - and like there was very hands off right
15:02 - and then we see that you grow up as that
15:05 - and you're like well that wasn't great
15:06 - now I'm going to be the opposite of that
15:09 - and we kind of go to the other side of
15:10 - the pendulum and now we have what you
15:13 - know we call helicopter parenting where
15:14 - you're like basically following your kid
15:15 - around everywhere they go and you're
15:16 - making sure they're all right and you're
15:17 - like overly safety cautious and you know
15:21 - both of those things have their
15:22 - drawbacks and so we try to find a
15:24 - balance I'm also like you very Hands-On
15:28 - um but I also I know that they need to
15:30 - have their freedoms they need to make
15:31 - their mistakes they need to uh be able
15:34 - to handle social interactions without
15:36 - muham and dad there to help them so they
15:38 - can learn how to do that as they grow so
15:40 - it's it's a difficult balance it's hard
15:42 - to strike it right I've Struck it wrong
15:44 - tons of times throughout my years and
15:46 - probably will continue to but um you
15:49 - know parenting is one of the most
15:50 - rewarding things you can do it's also
15:52 - one of the hardest things to do the way
15:53 - this ties back into software I mean the
15:55 - pendulum swing back and forth is just
15:56 - constant in the software world you know
15:58 - I you and I have both been in it for a
15:59 - very long time we've seen Technologies
16:01 - come and go we've seen techniques uh
16:05 - become all the rage and then you know 10
16:07 - years later become not the rage anymore
16:10 - here's a new thing and then a lot of
16:12 - times we return back to the old way and
16:14 - we re invent or we reestablish the way
16:17 - they used to do it and realize there was
16:19 - actually some good things about that and
16:21 - so finding that middle balance is really
16:23 - I think a a thing that comes from
16:26 - experience and a difficult part of being
16:27 - a software developer is not going all in
16:30 - on an extreme because you find yourself
16:33 - out there in the wilderness sometimes
16:35 - yeah and I mean it's very much like you
16:38 - know concentrating your chips on like a
16:40 - specific thing and I mean you could win
16:43 - big if you've just focused on becoming
16:45 - the world's expert on uh large language
16:48 - models for example and then bam that
16:50 - field Bears incredible fruit all of a
16:52 - sudden and you're one of those very few
16:54 - people who can do this job well and has
16:56 - like all the published papers and uh you
16:58 - know knows all the people in the
17:00 - industry and you can basically name your
17:02 - price to go work at like Nvidia or
17:04 - Microsoft or open AI or some place like
17:06 - that right but uh a lot of time like if
17:09 - you were working on a different branch
17:10 - of AI and you spent your entire career
17:12 - doing that and that ended up being one
17:14 - of the branches that hasn't yet borne
17:16 - fruit then you know so but the people
17:19 - who kind of like just were interested in
17:21 - AI in general and didn't specialize as
17:23 - much but like went around and tried all
17:25 - the different things and kind of spread
17:27 - their chips across the entire table
17:28 - those people I think are pretty well
17:29 - suited as well um so so I mean that I I
17:34 - want to make sure that that analogy
17:36 - makes sense that I am it correctly like
17:38 - picking up what you're saying but um
17:41 - yeah don't don't overly specialize and
17:43 - don't jump from one interest like Hacker
17:46 - News thread to the next like like the
17:48 - sky is falling right chicken little
17:50 - syndrome oh my goodness like this
17:53 - technology is going to completely
17:54 - replace react and like all the time I
17:56 - spent learning react is gone or you know
17:59 - even worse like why why should I learn
18:01 - anything everything's just going to be
18:02 - updated right that kind of like
18:04 - paralysis that a lot of developers
18:06 - feel yeah yeah that's the main thing I
18:08 - see with inexperienced
18:10 - developers is this like myopic worldview
18:14 - or like short
18:16 - shortsightedness because they just don't
18:18 - have the longevity that it's required to
18:21 - see things come and go and realize that
18:24 - like everything that goes to number one
18:26 - in Hacker News is not going to
18:29 - completely upend everything you just
18:31 - learned and make you obsolete right
18:33 - react while it's now currently being
18:36 - kind of uh pelted as the technology of
18:39 - choice and people are kind of assailing
18:41 - it with with the the downsides and the
18:43 - problems and here's some of better
18:44 - Alternatives you're starting to have
18:46 - that uh pendulum swing away from react
18:49 - right now but reactjs is so relevant
18:53 - right now and will continue to be so
18:55 - relevant for at least a decade if not 20
18:58 - years even even if other things come out
19:00 - and become that quote unquote new
19:01 - hotness so um a lot of us just need to
19:05 - chill out relax and not adopt every new
19:08 - thing that comes
19:09 - out and that's one of the things that I
19:11 - try to do with change log news is like
19:13 - keep people up to date on what's going
19:15 - on but realize that I'm not adopting
19:18 - most of this stuff you know we don't at
19:20 - change log we write all of our own
19:21 - software our platform is completely
19:22 - custom it's all open source I'm a
19:25 - working developer I have been the entire
19:27 - time I've been doing this podcast and I
19:29 - will continue to because I don't want to
19:31 - become a guy who just talks about
19:32 - software I want to be a guy who writes
19:34 - software and then talks about it I think
19:35 - that's important and I haven't adopted
19:38 - half the stuff that I've covered on
19:39 - change life I mean half is an
19:40 - overstatement you know I adopt like one
19:42 - out of a hundred things I think it's all
19:44 - cool I think you should know about it
19:46 - yeah and maybe you should adopt maybe
19:48 - you shouldn't there's a lot of it
19:49 - depends in there but just because people
19:52 - are excited about something new doesn't
19:54 - mean that new thing is going to actually
19:57 - stick around and provide meaningful
19:59 - value for you in your life in your
20:01 - business in your job Etc so that's a
20:05 - that's a hard lesson to learn I think
20:06 - you learn it kind of by making that
20:08 - mistake a few times yeah like you said
20:09 - Quincy you can make a big bet on
20:11 - something and that could pay off huge or
20:15 - it could be a complete
20:16 - flop and now what you know you want to
20:19 - be able to generalize enough that you
20:21 - can float above the es and flows of the
20:25 - industry yeah well said so let's talk
20:29 - about change log news a little bit and
20:31 - and how you put it together because this
20:34 - is like like uh you know orange juice
20:36 - from concentrate this is like you know
20:39 - open source and technology news from con
20:42 - like it it's difficult to imagine it
20:44 - becoming much more tur than it is how
20:47 - long is the typical episode it's like 8
20:48 - minutes
20:49 - maybe yeah so pretty much always under
20:52 - 10 you know 5 to 10 minutes is kind of
20:54 - The Sweet Spot and then we also have the
20:56 - companion newsletter which goes out at
20:57 - the exact same time so I think we're the
20:59 - only one but we're definitely one of the
21:01 - few if there's more than one who's a
21:02 - podcast and a newsletter at the same
21:05 - time with very complimentary content so
21:08 - the newsletter is longer has more links
21:10 - because I don't want the episode to get
21:11 - too long um but basically the audio is
21:14 - the top five stories out of the
21:16 - newsletter and then the newsletter is
21:18 - those in written form um usually a
21:20 - little bit terser I I'll go into more
21:22 - detail sometimes in audio if I feel like
21:24 - it and then you know more stuff
21:27 - interesting things that weren't necessar
21:28 - top five and so you get more links in
21:31 - there um and that's how it works I
21:34 - basically take the five things that I
21:35 - think are interesting for that week and
21:37 - I distill them down record a show it's 8
21:39 - to 10 minutes you know put it out every
21:41 - Monday yeah and it's so Punchy and like
21:44 - it just flows like I have to compliment
21:47 - your editing uh as I've told you and as
21:50 - I always say on the podcast like I have
21:52 - moved away from heavily editing toward
21:54 - just letting the conversation breathe
21:56 - and letting you hear the ums and O and
21:58 - likes and and you know hearing the real
22:01 - people like none of this is scripted
22:03 - right like that that entire thing that
22:04 - Jared and I that exchange we just had
22:06 - about like families and stuff like that
22:09 - that that was not premeditated at all
22:11 - and I hope you're getting interesting
22:12 - insight into who Jared is as a person
22:14 - you know his his thoughts his beliefs uh
22:17 - his philosophy on life and and similar
22:19 - to me uh and the goal for this
22:23 - conversation is completely different
22:24 - than the goal for the Chang log news and
22:27 - I think podcasting as as a medium is so
22:29 - flexible just like text newsletters
22:31 - right like you and I both have
22:32 - newsletters they're very different like
22:34 - my newsletter is like very turse and
22:36 - it's very focused it's almost like the
22:38 - the polar opposite of yours because you
22:41 - have like a lot of links it's still you
22:42 - know uh groomed to be very like concise
22:45 - and everything like that but You' got a
22:46 - lot more stuff in the newsletter and
22:48 - then the podcast is where it's really
22:50 - tight and concise and for me my
22:52 - newsletter is really tight and concise
22:54 - and my podcast is just like your podcast
22:56 - is really long yeah exactly that's
22:58 - hilarious yeah I didn't I didn't think
23:00 - about like that because you just do the
23:01 - five is the five things you need to
23:03 - learn this week or Camp resources worth
23:06 - your time basically it's just like free
23:08 - courses free books great I've been a
23:09 - long time subscriber of that I did not
23:11 - click your link when you're like come
23:12 - fill out a form cuz I'm not exactly your
23:14 - target audience so I think when you did
23:16 - the Great Purge recently you should you
23:17 - should do that so click it and uh yeah
23:22 - so I'll give context anybody who's
23:24 - interested in my newsletter you may have
23:25 - noticed like hey that's weird Quincy
23:27 - sent out this like link and he said like
23:29 - if you want to keep getting this you
23:30 - have to get this so I had a mailing list
23:32 - of 7 million people it costs a fortune
23:36 - to send 7 million emails each week it's
23:38 - it's like even the absolute cheapest
23:41 - commodity like delivery Amazon simple
23:43 - email service $700 a week which is a lot
23:47 - of money like you can have somebody work
23:49 - a l for you like like maybe not it's
23:51 - based here in the United States but but
23:53 - like you can compensate somebody for
23:54 - their time uh for like an entire you
23:57 - know that's that's that's somebody's
23:58 - salary essentially uh and uh a lot of
24:03 - people were getting it and they were
24:04 - like I don't even remember subscribing
24:05 - to this and yes every single person
24:07 - subscribed there's an opt-in process on
24:09 - free COC it's very transparent it's like
24:11 - do you want to get this email here's
24:13 - what it is and it's like sure no thanks
24:15 - and you know about half of people who
24:17 - signed up for a free Camp account say
24:19 - yes I want this and a lot of people say
24:21 - yes I want this and then they like later
24:23 - change their mind and they unsubscribe
24:24 - but uh I was like well I'm pretty sure
24:27 - because not every time I 10 7 million
24:29 - emails like 7 million people are
24:31 - clicking through to like the you know
24:33 - the Articles um so maybe we could pair
24:36 - this down and we could save everybody a
24:39 - lot of time and energy by not filling
24:41 - the inboxes of people who have since
24:43 - changed their mind and no longer want to
24:44 - get this but don't unsubscribe for some
24:45 - reason right and also 90% of emails that
24:50 - you send out to people are going to end
24:51 - up in Gmail like email is technically
24:54 - like an open protocol 90% of people use
24:57 - Gmail and Gmail was doing weird things
25:00 - where it was like putting my emails in
25:02 - spam even though people were like
25:04 - engaging and replying and stuff like who
25:05 - knows how Gmail's uh email and of course
25:09 - like when I compose these emails I have
25:12 - this big reference of spam words that uh
25:15 - are likely to end you up
25:17 - in the uh you know the spam box and one
25:20 - of them is free which is part of our
25:22 - name right but luckily free code camp
25:25 - that that string of characters does seem
25:27 - to be uh one but still like I can only
25:30 - mention the word free once I just
25:31 - mentioned it in the uh the you know the
25:34 - subject line I I don't ever mention free
25:36 - anywhere else in in the email just
25:38 - because I don't want to get like put
25:40 - into spam anyway sorry we want to learn
25:42 - from you but not just about the minutia
25:45 - of running an email newsletter but that
25:48 - that is something I sent out an email
25:50 - and and uh tens of thousands of people
25:52 - opted back in to continue to receive it
25:54 - but now we spend basically nothing
25:56 - sending the email each week and uh we're
25:59 - less likely to train Google like like
26:03 - fewer people are hitting report spam and
26:04 - stuff like that so yeah it's going to
26:06 - have higher deliverability going forward
26:08 - so it's it's kind of like win-win but uh
26:10 - yeah I just wanted to give you context
26:11 - to that and assure you that like yeah
26:13 - that's what I was referring to as the
26:14 - Great Purge because you went from 7
26:15 - million down to like dozen like you're
26:18 - down in the yeah tens of character or
26:20 - five numbers now yeah yeah but but
26:23 - awesome I mean that that takes some that
26:25 - takes I mean obviously you're taking the
26:26 - financial hit but you know just the lack
26:28 - of ego required to do that I think is
26:30 - Honorable because you're like you know
26:31 - what I want to send it to real people
26:33 - who actually want it they've already
26:34 - opted in once but I'm going to make them
26:35 - opt in a second time and make sure it's
26:37 - super high signal super low noise and I
26:40 - think that a lot of folks would like to
26:42 - just have that 7 million number but
26:44 - they're probably not paying out the sces
26:46 - I just want to be respectful of people
26:48 - like a lot of times people their eyes
26:50 - are bigger than their stomach and I
26:51 - totally get that and I totally like I've
26:53 - been there right um and I unsubscribe to
26:55 - a lot of newsletters that I sign up for
26:56 - too so like same thing like it's just
26:59 - kind of like our privacy philosophy uh
27:01 - if somebody wants to unsubscribe there's
27:02 - a a single link they can click boom
27:04 - unsubscribe we're never going to email
27:06 - you again don't worry about it right uh
27:08 - and and then if you want to delete your
27:10 - account you never have to send free Camp
27:12 - support like hey delete my account
27:14 - delete literally everything you have on
27:15 - me like we get these kind of automated
27:17 - requests people that like sign up for
27:19 - these services to like go delete all my
27:21 - data from the web and they send these
27:22 - annoying emails to everybody and every
27:24 - single small website owner has to deal
27:26 - with these like automated mess Mees that
27:28 - are basically spammed out uh by these
27:30 - Services don't use those Services just
27:33 - just go to freecodecamp.org click
27:35 - settings scroll to the bottom hit delete
27:37 - it's like are you sure hit it it's going
27:40 - to delete not only your uh record but
27:43 - it'll delete like literally everything
27:45 - and and that record even our backup is
27:47 - deleted after like a week so so like
27:49 - literally there will be no Trace that
27:50 - you ever had a free Cod Camp account and
27:53 - it's not like we're like selling your
27:54 - email to anybody or anything like that
27:56 - if you read our pre privacy term
27:58 - they are extremely explicit like we
28:00 - wrote everything because we respect
28:03 - people's privacy and yeah anyway so this
28:06 - is something I feel really strongly
28:07 - about and I'm really irritated when
28:09 - people abuse like LinkedIn like don't
28:11 - get me started on LinkedIn I could talk
28:12 - all day about and they've been sued
28:13 - repeatedly for this but like they abuse
28:16 - your trust and they manipulate you and
28:17 - stuff like that with like these you know
28:19 - ux dark patterns and stuff but freeo
28:21 - games not going to do that we we do have
28:23 - a profound amount of respect for you
28:25 - back to change long
28:26 - news no oh good no ditto I think we're
28:29 - in the same uh spiritual Camp there
28:32 - absolutely we turned off click tracking
28:34 - on all of our emails we don't know what
28:36 - I mean as a author of an email
28:38 - newsletter which is kind of the yindi or
28:40 - Yan Quincy because 90% of the links in
28:43 - our email linked to somebody else's
28:45 - website right we're not linking the only
28:46 - ones that link back to our websites are
28:48 - just like here's the podcasts that we
28:49 - put out this week and then everything
28:51 - else is outbound to somebody else and so
28:53 - uh it is interesting to me as an author
28:56 - of a newsletter to say okay what is
28:58 - everybody what did everybody like out of
29:00 - this issue because I can use that
29:01 - information hopefully to make the next
29:03 - issue better give them more of what they
29:05 - like you know and so that information is
29:07 - interesting to me as an author but uh
29:09 - not interesting enough so we just turn
29:11 - it off and we don't do any link tracking
29:13 - so we have no idea what you're clicking
29:15 - one of the great side effects of that
29:17 - which is a small thing but for me as a
29:18 - nerd is heartwarming and I love it is
29:21 - that when you're reading our newsletter
29:22 - you can actually just hover over the
29:25 - link you know just like good old fasten
29:27 - HTML
29:28 - and it will show you exactly where that
29:30 - link is going versus being some sort of
29:32 - a redirect in between you know there's
29:34 - no redirects or anything like that so
29:35 - you go straight to the website I like
29:37 - that cuz sometimes I look at a link
29:38 - yours are actually just PL text so it's
29:40 - the same thing yeah I'm the only gu even
29:42 - better more big newsletter that just
29:43 - uses plain text and people marketers
29:45 - always send me emails they're like hey
29:46 - what's your email is not optimized I can
29:48 - design it why don't you do tricky
29:50 - tracking and sorry to go off and yet
29:53 - another rant but I'm not going to do
29:55 - anything with that data anyway like
29:58 - it's G to make me feel better I I swear
30:00 - like so much of this data collection is
30:01 - just to make marketers feel better about
30:03 - themselves and it doesn't actually have
30:04 - any like business you know people are
30:06 - going to click on it or they aren't and
30:08 - every single article is so different
30:09 - like how can you like are you going to
30:11 - like create custom emails for people
30:13 - that tend to click on like you know data
30:15 - science related things I mean yeah you
30:16 - could you could definitely do that but
30:18 - um I'd rather just like literally no
30:21 - track just plain text plain literal text
30:23 - no HTML file or anything um and I think
30:26 - it does improve deliverability I of
30:28 - course if you've got a nice looking
30:30 - template like you do looks very
30:31 - professional I think it's totally fine
30:33 - and I applaud you for not invading
30:35 - people's privacy with like trackers and
30:37 - stuff and showing them literally what
30:39 - they're going to get you know when they
30:40 - hover over yours I I I think that's
30:44 - amazing yeah it's a small thing but it's
30:47 - a it's a thing that we do and a thing
30:49 - that I appreciate as a as a reader um
30:52 - but yeah that's the newsletter man it's
30:54 - you know been going on for a long time
30:55 - now Chang log news as a podcast is is
30:58 - like you said kind of opposite of the
30:59 - free code podcast but we have also
31:01 - interview shows that we've been doing I
31:03 - mean our bread and butter over the
31:04 - course of the 15 years we've been a
31:06 - thing are interviews and conversational
31:08 - podcasts so this like highly edited 5 to
31:11 - 10 minute news thing we do on each
31:12 - Monday really is new I think we're on
31:15 - episode 94 of those so we've done less
31:17 - than 100 of those and it was really a
31:19 - break from that uh inside the same exact
31:22 - feed so one of the most recent things
31:23 - we've done with the change log is we've
31:26 - expanded into a two different uh a few
31:28 - different flavors of the same show so
31:30 - you can just subscribe to the change log
31:31 - podcast and on Monday you'll get that
31:33 - brief news episode on Wednesday you'll
31:36 - get our traditional Deep dive technical
31:37 - interview and then on Friday we have
31:39 - this thing we call change login friends
31:42 - which is a talk show and so it's more
31:44 - Freewheel in we bring in recurring
31:46 - guests we talk about what's going on uh
31:48 - in the tech world and just about
31:49 - whatever sometimes um and so it's less
31:52 - of an interview more of a conversation
31:54 - and those are all the same podcast it's
31:56 - the change log you can get them
31:58 - separately cuz some people I just want
32:00 - your interviews man why don't you go
32:01 - back to the old thing we're like well
32:02 - here's a feed for you to just have the
32:04 - interview that's cool you have multiple
32:05 - feeds we may do that at some point if we
32:08 - expand Beyond just having me talking to
32:10 - people and and have like some sort of
32:11 - new sh but like I don't really feel the
32:13 - need to do that because all the open
32:14 - source news is covered by Jared right
32:17 - yeah well thank you yeah I mean it's
32:19 - that's a place where we've been as well
32:21 - I mean we have other shows that we
32:22 - produce like JS party is about web
32:24 - development we have practical AI which
32:26 - is about AI we have go time which is
32:28 - about go and then but the change log has
32:30 - always been kind of like the polyglot
32:32 - overarching you know what's happening
32:34 - across the entire ecosystem or software
32:36 - developers um and a lot of other niches
32:39 - people have asked us please make a
32:41 - podcast for rust you know and I've
32:43 - always been like well that's some pretty
32:44 - good Russ podcasts why didn't you just
32:45 - go listen to those so I don't want to
32:47 - just make a podcast to make a podcast uh
32:50 - we want to fill an actual void and I
32:52 - don't feel like there's a void there
32:54 - people have also asked us to make Elixir
32:56 - podcast because we make pretty good
32:58 - podcasts and we use Elixir and there's
32:59 - people who like elixir and it's like
33:01 - well there's pretty good Elixir podcasts
33:02 - out there so yeah like why I'm happy to
33:05 - just promote you to go listen to those
33:08 - and so yeah um yeah we have expanded the
33:11 - change log to three times a week with
33:12 - the news and the interview and the talk
33:15 - and then we have these like little shows
33:16 - that do specific communities but we feel
33:18 - like you know people are pretty well
33:21 - served in software world with a decent
33:23 - op amount of options for good
33:26 - podcasts they said if anybody wants to
33:28 - get into podcasting like you know I
33:31 - think you and I could both say like it's
33:33 - fun I love listening to podcast I listen
33:36 - to I mean people don't believe me how
33:38 - when I say how many they think I'm
33:40 - exaggerating but I I probably listen
33:41 - like two hours of podcast a day maybe
33:43 - three hours cuz at listen on double
33:44 - speed are you a 2X are you a 3X a double
33:47 - speed I I've tried 3x I feel like I do
33:49 - lose a lot of the information if I go up
33:52 - above 2x um also that's the fastest
33:55 - Apple podcast we you will do I think and
33:58 - I insist on using Apple podcast because
34:00 - that's what most people use right
34:01 - especially outside of the US people
34:03 - aren't using spotify uh they're not
34:06 - necessarily watching this on YouTube
34:07 - though you know people listening to this
34:09 - may be watching this on YouTube like the
34:10 - number one way that people consume
34:12 - podcasts in the United States is through
34:14 - Apple podcast and if you have an iPhone
34:16 - it's built in and it's they keep
34:19 - changing it they keep moving little
34:20 - stuff around it is annoying I know but I
34:22 - insist on using it because that's what
34:24 - other people use and I want to be able
34:25 - to empathize with people like there are
34:27 - lots of spoke tools like listen notes is
34:29 - an amazing tool if you're trying to do
34:31 - research if you really want to like find
34:34 - cuz podcast is you know it's a messy
34:36 - kind of it's hard to search and find
34:38 - good stuff but thankfully listen notes
34:40 - is an amazing search engine uh for
34:43 - podcast run by win Bing Fong who hasn't
34:45 - been on this podcast but he has been on
34:47 - our Chinese language podcast if you're a
34:49 - Chinese speaker go listen to that it's a
34:51 - really great interview I practice my
34:52 - listening comprehension by listening to
34:54 - that uh super chill dude but um I think
34:57 - the the main thing I want to say
34:59 - is um on the Note like there is so much
35:04 - room for interesting Niche podcasts uh
35:08 - if you want to write if you want to
35:09 - create a podcast about you know what
35:11 - it's like to be a developer in Houston
35:14 - or something like that right like the
35:16 - Houston texting could absolutely have
35:18 - its own podcast if they wanted to like
35:21 - and you can go as deep as you want
35:22 - you've got people like me that are
35:24 - already listening like three hours a day
35:25 - we need stuff to listen to you've got uh
35:28 - truck drivers you've got people who uh
35:31 - are just at their jobs all day and are
35:33 - doing something that doesn't require
35:34 - their full attention they can
35:35 - continually listen to podcast it's
35:37 - really probably the most under
35:39 - appreciated and underexplored medium in
35:41 - my humble
35:43 - opinion MH it's a great medium I mean
35:46 - conversations are like as old as time
35:49 - you know and we just as humans we just
35:52 - enjoy conversation we learn so much from
35:54 - conversation and the amount of nuance
35:56 - and care and empathy that you have from
35:59 - just like listening to people talk and
36:01 - and sometimes we hem and we Haw you know
36:03 - and we we beat around the bush and like
36:05 - you can feel that versus the edited uh
36:10 - completely thought out preis you know
36:12 - pre thought out written edited blog post
36:14 - yeah scripted but like the way that you
36:16 - write an article it's like you think
36:19 - about it you write it you you draft it
36:21 - then you rewrite it you edit it blah
36:23 - blah blah and so like people hold that
36:24 - to a higher level of scrutiny there's so
36:26 - much grace in podcast casting you know
36:28 - just hearing a conversation whereas you
36:30 - know so we have this show called go time
36:34 - uh which is all about the go programming
36:35 - language and people who write it Etc and
36:38 - one of their Deals they have this
36:39 - unpopular opinion segment I'm not sure
36:40 - if you've heard this Quincy um it's
36:42 - where they basically they all bring an
36:44 - unpopular opinion to share and related
36:47 - to programing put them out on or is it
36:49 - like pineapple on pizza or like well it
36:52 - can be about anything okay like the show
36:54 - is about you know programming with the
36:56 - It Go and systems and stuff like that
36:58 - but the unpopular opinion is can be
37:00 - about anything so sometimes a lot of
37:02 - times they're about food sometimes it's
37:04 - about go it could be about AI it could
37:05 - be about whatever and all you have to
37:08 - bring something that you think will be
37:09 - unpopular with the gotime audience
37:12 - basically and so a lot of people come
37:14 - with this really Brash oneliner you know
37:17 - and we're going to put that out on
37:18 - social media for we we take a vote
37:20 - afterwards on each one like is it
37:21 - actually unpopular or not and what we
37:23 - find is really fascinating which is that
37:26 - the oneliner is off often unpopular it's
37:29 - like here's my oneliner and people are
37:31 - like no that's wrong nobody liked that
37:32 - yes but then after you say the oneliner
37:34 - everyone kind of sits there and now you
37:36 - got to explain what you think about that
37:37 - one line you know you have to kind of
37:39 - like uh Circle it out flesh it out and
37:44 - often times if you actually listen to
37:45 - the two minutes or what however however
37:47 - long it is of the person explaining
37:49 - their op by the time they're done
37:51 - explain you kind of agree with them it's
37:53 - like yeah okay I can see it like the
37:54 - oneliner was you know essentially vot
37:57 - bait clickbait but then with the Nuance
38:00 - with the full context with the it
38:02 - depends is all that in there it ends up
38:06 - being like well actually that's
38:07 - reasonable and I think that's just a a
38:10 - testament to the the way the podcasts
38:11 - work yeah yeah I mean like I think I've
38:15 - been educated so much by just hearing
38:17 - descending opinions on podcasts over the
38:19 - years and getting that Nuance that you
38:22 - don't get from headlines and what is
38:24 - Facebook Newsfeed you scroll through
38:26 - headlines what is Twitter headlines or I
38:28 - mean like literally tweets have been
38:29 - constrained to where you can only have
38:31 - the headline you can't you have to do
38:33 - like an entire threat if you want more
38:34 - than that it's a terrible medium uh so
38:38 - yeah like Nuance is kind of just lost
38:41 - and you know what gets clicks what gets
38:43 - bubbled to the top
38:45 - is whatever outrages people
38:47 - unfortunately um rage bait rage bait
38:50 - exactly and you know with podcasting
38:52 - it's it's completely different it's like
38:54 - almost like this dark matter of the
38:57 - content world because it's so impen I
39:00 - mean spotify's done a lot to like create
39:01 - like automatic little clips and share it
39:04 - and stuff like that and we don't
39:05 - generally do that we don't like cut out
39:07 - like the highlights of the the video and
39:09 - do that I know you all do that but I
39:11 - like listening to the conversation and
39:12 - its entirety take it all in I it's like
39:15 - when I when I read a book I don't go to
39:17 - the bookstore and get like Cliff Notes I
39:19 - go and read the the actual book you know
39:22 - I want I want to hear everything that uh
39:24 - this author had to say about the subject
39:26 - matter right and so I I do think
39:29 - something's lost when you compress like
39:31 - there's no such thing as lossless
39:32 - compression with human communication
39:35 - uh I like that that's a good quote okay
39:38 - cool is like just a little r that one
39:41 - put that on a put that on a clip Quincy
39:43 - you should clip that put that out there
39:45 - all right uh uh I agree with you we we
39:47 - clip for two reasons uh the first reason
39:49 - is you know we recognize that not
39:52 - everybody has the time to listen to 60
39:54 - 90 you know 120 Minutes um secondly
39:57 - obviously we're trying to draw people in
39:59 - I mean that's the entire reason that we
40:00 - do it like we don't have clips for Clips
40:03 - sake we just want to give you a taste
40:04 - and say oh that's interesting and then
40:06 - come listen to the full conversation so
40:08 - all of that stuff is just pointers back
40:09 - to what we think is really uh the bees
40:12 - knes and that's the full conversations
40:15 - but we realize that yeah some people I
40:16 - mean we have got people that just live
40:17 - off our Clips they're like you have the
40:18 - best Clips I'm like do you listen to the
40:19 - podcast no I just listen to the clips
40:21 - I'm like okay that's weird but I get it
40:23 - you know not everybody has time yeah but
40:25 - the nice thing about podcasting is how
40:27 - Works its way into everything else like
40:29 - it's not a zero some medium you don't
40:31 - have to stare at it you know the video
40:33 - yeah you can put it in a tab in the
40:34 - background now you're basically
40:35 - listening to a podcast but video
40:37 - requires you to stare at it text
40:38 - requires you to stare at it whereas a
40:40 - podcast you can be walking the dog at
40:42 - the park with the kids you can be mowing
40:44 - the lawn working out commuting like all
40:46 - the things it really works its way into
40:48 - your life and I just find that to be so
40:50 - much easier to consume other mediums I
40:54 - mean podcast and it's so intimate is the
40:57 - other thing that people don't appreciate
40:58 - is like you're literally hearing a
41:00 - conversation between me and Jared like
41:03 - where would you hear that you would have
41:04 - to like meet us at some conference in
41:07 - either like Dallas or or in in uh you
41:10 - know Omaha or more likely in like San
41:12 - Francisco or something right um and we
41:14 - you would have to be within earshot and
41:16 - you'd have to stand there at that exact
41:18 - moment that we were talking and you know
41:20 - who knows maybe we'd be getting
41:22 - distracted like all these other things
41:23 - would be happening around us you would
41:25 - not get this conversation anywhere El
41:27 - like this could very much just
41:29 - be Jared and I just catching up on like
41:32 - a video call and it's it's lost of time
41:35 - it was never recorded of course there is
41:37 - like a little bit of a um I guess
41:40 - Observer uh pattern I'm I'm trying to
41:42 - think of like how would you describe it
41:44 - but but like we do know this is being
41:46 - record we don't know we do know that
41:48 - there's an audience here so it does kind
41:50 - of performance we talk about a little
41:52 - bit but uh I mean yeah I would say this
41:55 - like how I am on the podcast is very
41:56 - similar how I am in my day-to-day
41:58 - meetings with different people uh the
42:00 - only thing is like I'll like explain
42:02 - acronyms or I might um you know break
42:04 - out like I'll try to say something in a
42:06 - more simple way or I'll say things like
42:09 - to remind people to give people
42:10 - additional context if they're listening
42:12 - but I mean this is this is who I am and
42:14 - I get the vibe that this is who you are
42:16 - right you're like not guarded or
42:17 - anything you're just like you know
42:19 - exactly chill dude who loves open source
42:21 - software so absolutely so maybe we can
42:23 - talk about the the podcast and its
42:25 - origin story like of course we've
42:27 - already talked about the change log
42:28 - itself but the news show like what made
42:29 - you decide to do a news
42:31 - show yeah good
42:34 - question so we had a newsletter for a
42:37 - long time it used to be called change
42:38 - log weekly and we did probably 400
42:41 - issues of those and that was just our
42:43 - weekly news we didn't have any audio
42:46 - news
42:48 - um and we would sometimes discuss the
42:50 - news so JS party is another podcast that
42:52 - we do it's all about JavaScript in the
42:53 - web and on that show it's more of a we
42:57 - we think of it like a variety show
42:58 - versus the change log wi is
42:59 - conversations that's like we play games
43:02 - you know we make up we we do silly stuff
43:05 - uh we have like formalized debates like
43:07 - there's a variety to it and they're kind
43:08 - of like segmented and like here we're
43:09 - going to do this then this then that and
43:11 - one of the things we do in there we have
43:13 - this thing called story of the week
43:14 - where it's basically like each person
43:15 - brings a story and we try to convince
43:17 - each other that's the most important
43:19 - story of the week and we say why and we
43:21 - basically just discussed the news and um
43:25 - so we had that a little bit like news
43:26 - discussion
43:27 - sometimes you want to just know what's
43:28 - going on other times you want to hear
43:30 - what people think about it you know and
43:33 - we never had just that in audio format
43:35 - so through my editing and and production
43:39 - of JS party and a lot of the different
43:40 - segments that we do and the music and
43:42 - the sounds and all this kind of stuff I
43:44 - just gain the confidence I guess it
43:45 - requires to completely edit and produce
43:49 - my own you know piece of audio from
43:51 - start to finish and thought about giving
43:54 - a try it was actually something that
43:55 - Adam and I is my co-host he's not here
43:58 - today but um partner in crime as you
44:00 - said at the top have wanted to do for a
44:03 - very long time we just couldn't really
44:04 - figure out how to crack that nut how to
44:07 - make it you know how does it make money
44:08 - how does it make it self sustainable we
44:10 - wanted to do daily for a while and it's
44:12 - like can we do a daily news show so we
44:14 - thought about that and it's like well
44:16 - that's biting off a lot is weekly enough
44:18 - so like a lot of just those you know you
44:20 - have an idea and you don't actually do
44:22 - it for a very long time or maybe that's
44:25 - just us and eventually I was like well
44:27 - and Adam one time a couple years AG uh
44:29 - recorded like a thre minute thing that
44:31 - was like a I remember listen pilot of a
44:33 - new show it was like incredibly dense
44:35 - like way too dense it was yeah it was
44:38 - very quick and dense and I was like well
44:41 - that's too fast and too much so it
44:43 - doesn't really provide it's like
44:44 - basically reading the headlines you know
44:46 - and you don't want to just read the
44:47 - headlines cuz you can just do that
44:49 - really quickly yourself what you want is
44:52 - a little bit more of like the why and so
44:54 - that's kind of where the Genesis of
44:56 - Chang log news
44:57 - began and I just tried it one time and
45:00 - put it out there as a pilot on the feed
45:02 - and I'm like let us know if you like
45:03 - this and we got a lot of positive
45:05 - feedback from the listeners and so uh we
45:07 - decideed just to keep going and it's
45:09 - kind of it's morph and changed you know
45:10 - try to make it better over the the
45:13 - course of 94 episodes but yeah that's
45:15 - where that came from and um yeah it's
45:19 - it's fun it's interesting people like it
45:21 - there's people who like it's their
45:23 - favorite thing in the world there's
45:24 - other people who like yeah I could take
45:26 - it or leave it and that's cool yeah um I
45:29 - enjoyed doing it and uh people seem to
45:31 - like it yeah and I have to say like it
45:33 - you put a lot of thought and effort into
45:35 - the production and it's incredibly
45:38 - polished like the sound design like
45:40 - there there's all these kind of like it
45:42 - feels almost like these kind of call
45:44 - back it's always like it's your boy
45:46 - Jared like like there're like almost
45:48 - kind of like memes and catchphrases and
45:50 - stuff that like tend to like happen in
45:53 - there and it it it seems incredibly well
45:56 - thought out and like every moment is
45:58 - like paste and everything uh one of the
46:01 - things I really love about it is like I
46:03 - said the sound design and like the
46:04 - incorporation of lots of clips and and
46:06 - you know ear candy essentially uh the
46:09 - sauce that goes on top of the news right
46:11 - the steak is since from Oma we'll talk
46:14 - about steaks right the steak and then
46:16 - you put like your A1 or your wor this
46:18 - year or your you know custom like sauce
46:21 - I don't know what do people put on
46:22 - steaks out there and again I want to
46:24 - apologize to anybody who in the audience
46:25 - who's vegetarian or Hindu or anything
46:27 - like that but but like please allow me
46:30 - to entertain Jared with this line of
46:33 - questioning yes uh what do people put on
46:35 - steaks here in Oma well of course you
46:37 - have the purists the one that say if you
46:39 - put sauce on it it's because the steak
46:41 - was bad and so it's kind of an in and if
46:43 - you do it at someone's house it can be
46:44 - an insult because you're like oh you're
46:45 - trying to cover up my steak and then of
46:47 - course we have people who put yeah A1
46:49 - bold wores Shire um of course a lot of
46:52 - the the toppings like uh blue cheese you
46:55 - know kind of cheese what do you call
46:57 - those things on a stick yeah like the
47:00 - crumbles blue Crum Crum okay but not the
47:02 - dressing all right like a cream sauce
47:04 - yeah yeah yeah so people do that um I
47:08 - don't know is that is that typical there
47:10 - as well you know in Texas we take our
47:12 - Stak pretty serious I'm one of those
47:13 - purists like I don't put any sauce on it
47:15 - but um same yeah like I just love it
47:18 - like if they did a good job of preparing
47:19 - it and they used like the right
47:20 - seasoning and everything then I'm like
47:22 - wow this tastes amazing and I don't eat
47:23 - a lot of steak I eat it periodic if they
47:26 - don't do it good job and it's all dry
47:28 - and hard you know then what do you do I
47:29 - mean I I send it back Frank take it I'm
47:32 - like send it back I always ask for sake
47:33 - rare I want to taste the blood of the
47:35 - animal that was sacrificed so I could
47:37 - eat that meal I I mean like it may sound
47:39 - silly but like what I'm trying to teach
47:41 - my kids is like like when we walk down
47:43 - the curb we look out for Roly py all
47:45 - life is precious
47:47 - humans like I have two of my brothers
47:50 - are vegetarians right like one of them
47:51 - is even vegan right um they're raising
47:53 - their kids to be vegetarian but like as
47:55 - soon as they come over to Grandma in
47:57 - Grandpa's house they're like eating all
47:58 - the beef jerky and stuff but uh right
48:01 - you know like like I definitely believe
48:03 - that life is precious and like life
48:04 - should not unnecessarily be destroyed
48:07 - like when we walk down the sidewalk we
48:09 - all me and my kids in the morning when
48:10 - we're walking to school we look out for
48:12 - insects and I'm like oh rly poliy look
48:14 - out for the rly poy and we're very
48:15 - careful when we capture like a butterfly
48:17 - we we C captured a butterfly yesterday
48:19 - and we and I say we can only keep the
48:21 - butterfly for one night it stays in the
48:24 - the hotel the lson residence for one
48:26 - night and and then we release it so it
48:28 - can go back and it can find a mate and
48:30 - you know do all its butterfly business
48:32 - because this is just like you know it's
48:35 - not worth us having the joy of having
48:38 - this butterfly captured to you know keep
48:41 - the butterfly from its its own life uh
48:44 - so so I just want to say that like I do
48:46 - have reverence for the animal I never
48:48 - make light of the fact that an animal
48:49 - died so that I could eat meat but I do
48:51 - eat meat and I think that it's you know
48:53 - I'm I'm not going to try to talk people
48:54 - out of being vegetarian I was a
48:56 - vegetarian for like
48:57 - three or four years right and one day we
48:59 - were driving down the road I was you
49:00 - know my friend and I uh you know and and
49:04 - he's just like man like don't you ever
49:06 - just want me we looked over at the cows
49:09 - they were just standing there and like
49:11 - the population of cows is like much
49:12 - higher now than it ever was before
49:14 - humans you cultivated them right and I
49:17 - was like all right all right and I I I I
49:19 - reverted to my meat eating ways um and I
49:22 - think I've been healthier as a result
49:24 - may maybe I yeah anyway sorry this is
49:26 - going to upset a lot of people I don't
49:28 - censor or edit my podcast uh but I did
49:31 - want to kind of justify my carnivorous
49:33 - ways to the audience and the reason I
49:36 - mentioned Omaha and Stak and the whole
49:38 - thing this came up is like Omaha Stakes
49:39 - are held up as like the best like it is
49:42 - steak country right like it's a huge
49:44 - agricultural export for you all
49:47 - right yeah absolutely Omaha Stakes is
49:50 - one of the things we're known for also
49:51 - corn of course the Nebraska Corn Huskers
49:54 - is the name of our uh link you know
49:56 - University of Nebraska football team so
49:58 - people think about corn and they think
50:00 - about steak and they don't think about
50:01 - very much else you know because Nebraska
50:03 - doesn't have too many geographic
50:04 - features or they call it fly over
50:06 - country for a reason you know um but we
50:09 - do have Stakes the reason why you
50:10 - brought it up is you're asking like uh
50:12 - what do you put on your steak about back
50:14 - to the actual podcast like and stuff how
50:17 - do you the the ear candy as I said like
50:20 - how do you make it so compelling and
50:21 - it's like an experience like delightful
50:24 - I'm like walking around you know walking
50:25 - around the neighborhood walking around
50:27 - the gym and like ding you know cool
50:29 - sound bite that I haven't thought of
50:31 - from some '90s movie it's it's cool I
50:33 - mean the the amount of time and energy
50:35 - you put into it it it is definitely
50:36 - worth it for me anyway as a listener
50:38 - maybe you can talk a little bit about
50:39 - that like your philosophy as far as like
50:41 - finding things that is like sounds good
50:44 - enough or is like a pop culture
50:46 - reference that people are actually going
50:47 - to get and it's not from some like Indie
50:48 - movie or something like that it's
50:50 - something people actually like refence
50:51 - yeah that's the hard part so I
50:53 - definitely like I am definitely a
50:56 - reference guy like I
50:58 - love you know the pop culture and film
51:02 - and like all these things and song and
51:05 - of course my pop culture references are
51:07 - all very skewed towards like American
51:10 - grew up mostly in the 90s
51:13 - male right um and so because of that a
51:17 - lot of my references that I throw in
51:19 - when I first started the change doog
51:20 - news it was like really thick with
51:22 - references cuz I love that kind of stuff
51:24 - um pull them in reference things not ODS
51:27 - you know sound bites uh remember like
51:30 - VH1's popup video or whatever it was
51:32 - like I love that show where like in like
51:34 - tell you about that was so cool yeah
51:36 - trivia they have something like that
51:38 - onon xray or something where it's like
51:40 - it tells you kind of IMD that's cool
51:42 - that's a cool feature yeah it'll show
51:44 - like it'll show you who's on screen
51:45 - right now and that kind of stuff I love
51:48 - all that and I really started out I was
51:49 - thick on it I was very thick on it
51:51 - because it was like it was like a a
51:53 - labor of love that I was doing and I was
51:54 - trying something new and I probably
51:56 - overdid it for a while because you know
51:58 - we had some people complain like these
51:59 - references are stupid there's a waste of
52:01 - time like I don't get them and then we
52:03 - have people who love them and so it's
52:04 - kind of torn like well you know which
52:07 - way do I lean because they're not really
52:09 - all that additive except for the ear
52:10 - candy you know sometimes you want that
52:13 - little bit of sprinkle on top and other
52:14 - times you're like oh it's too sweet you
52:16 - know less sprinkles please and so I've
52:19 - kind of chilled out on them I've I've
52:20 - definitely dialed it back but that just
52:22 - comes out of what I would want to listen
52:23 - to I love things where people have taken
52:25 - time to throw in that extra little jab
52:29 - you know just because or make that
52:31 - reference then and if I get it then I'm
52:33 - in and if I don't get it then I might be
52:35 - curious and be like what movie from is
52:37 - that from and I would link up in the
52:40 - transcript where each reference was
52:42 - pulled from so like if you were super
52:43 - into it and you be like what was that
52:45 - sound you can go to the transcript and
52:47 - find the YouTube video which will link
52:49 - you back to the source material and
52:50 - stuff like that so that was awesome I
52:53 - still do it I just do it less than I
52:55 - used to and then the of our sound and
52:57 - stuff is all just like really awesome
52:59 - music and noises produced by breakmaster
53:01 - cylinder who we've had on retainer for
53:04 - years and we just request cool new you
53:07 - know I'm like hey can you make more
53:09 - Droid sounds for me I just need some
53:10 - more droids you know and then like make
53:12 - them shorter make them louder make them
53:13 - cuter make them uglier and like BMC just
53:16 - bumps out new sounds all the time so
53:18 - we're just incorporating those just
53:20 - trying to make it as as good as we can
53:22 - you know yeah shout out to brickmas
53:24 - cylinder and the brickmas cyinder music
53:27 - episode that the change log published a
53:28 - while back that was really cool to
53:30 - listen brickmas cylinder is like a music
53:32 - producer very mysterious character but
53:36 - not that mysterious after you brought
53:38 - them on it was amazing to listen to them
53:40 - and like hear about their process and
53:42 - their their philosophy uh and how
53:44 - they're so uh prolific uh I mean they've
53:47 - done music for so many podcasts like
53:49 - big- time podcasts oh yeah I mean not
53:51 - that the change log isn't a big time
53:53 - podcast but like I know what you mean
53:55 - like like Main media like I don't know
53:58 - if I've heard him on like New York Times
53:59 - or Washington Post but but like I have
54:01 - heard him on some big like proper news
54:04 - well-funded podcasts as well yeah yeah
54:09 - BMC kind of made a living on podcast
54:11 - theme songs specifically and so you'll
54:14 - find a lot of break master cylinder
54:15 - mentions at the end of shows because
54:17 - part of the you know agreement is like
54:19 - well you got to mention the the music
54:20 - produced by at the end people are happy
54:22 - to do it we're happy to do it as well
54:24 - and we first heard about break master
54:26 - cylinder because of the reply all
54:27 - podcast which was on gimlet back when
54:29 - reply all was a thing and gimlet was a
54:31 - thing in the early days of like the
54:33 - second Boon of podcasting and we just
54:36 - hooked up with BMC and a lot of people
54:39 - hire them to do a song but nobody does
54:43 - what we do which is like can you just
54:45 - stick around forever and just keep
54:47 - making music for us and so much we have
54:49 - so much music now original tracks
54:52 - written by and produced by BMC for our
54:54 - shows exclusively that we have a whole
54:57 - another thing called change log beats
54:59 - which is albums we have full length
55:00 - albums there's three of them currently
55:02 - that you can go listen to in Spotify and
55:04 - apple music and wherever you get your
55:06 - streaming music yeah and listen to like
55:09 - just break master cylinder beats you
55:11 - know produce for change log yeah and I
55:13 - love them my kids love them we listen to
55:15 - them in the car it's just cool so that's
55:17 - been an interesting kind of a what do
55:20 - you call it a an emergent phenomenon
55:23 - like it wasn't like we planned any of
55:24 - that it just kind of happened
55:26 - yeah and uh I love chip tune music and
55:31 - uh breakmaster like often incorporates
55:33 - kind of like those kind of blips and
55:35 - like really fast uh arpeggios and stuff
55:38 - uh yeah it's so cool to listen to and
55:41 - that's and then Adam and I are big like
55:43 - I think we're agem mates for the most
55:44 - part
55:45 - Quincy Adam as well we grew up in the
55:47 - late 80s early 90s and so a lot of our
55:50 - influences are um video game references
55:54 - so like we have an entire album called
55:56 - Next Level which is just video game
55:59 - themed songs that we've asked BMC to
56:01 - create over the years like hey make us
56:02 - another one that sounds like Castlevania
56:04 - you know make us one that sounds like
56:05 - Mega Man and we just have been
56:07 - incorporating those into our shows so
56:09 - yeah chip tuni uh8 bit 16 bit yeah a lot
56:13 - of cool stuff awesome well the show is
56:15 - amazing uh I'm excited to continue to
56:18 - listen to it as it progresses but I mean
56:20 - you've definitely found a lane as far as
56:22 - just really quick open source kind of
56:25 - highlights from the the open source
56:28 - Comedia Comedia uh Community there is so
56:31 - much going on in open source like I
56:33 - think people might look at like you know
56:35 - GitHub trending or other places like
56:37 - that just to see what's going on but
56:38 - there's so much going on that is never
56:42 - like really a lighted shined on it and I
56:45 - think it's great that you all are
56:46 - bringing a lot of that stuff to the
56:47 - Forefront and making it much more uh
56:50 - you're surfacing it you're surfacing the
56:52 - hard work of many developers around the
56:54 - world and uh also kind of like providing
56:57 - analysis whereas if you go to like a
56:58 - GitHub Project Read me and you're like
57:01 - why is this important like what is this
57:02 - relevant to me but you know when you put
57:04 - it in the context of Jared breaking it
57:06 - down for you telling you like hey this
57:08 - is cool because XYZ like this is in
57:11 - interesting facts about the project it
57:13 - just brings it to life and it makes me
57:15 - it makes it seem so much more relevant
57:16 - to me as a listener than if I were just
57:18 - you know scroll get up trending all day
57:21 - and like clicking on random projects and
57:22 - stuff yeah yeah so I'm really interested
57:26 - to talk about open source as a whole
57:28 - this is kind of sure so we can move from
57:31 - talking about the change log talking
57:32 - about uh the show which again like link
57:35 - to it in the show notes in the video
57:38 - description like just go listen to it
57:39 - subscribe to it I you will not regret
57:41 - this you're going to learn a lot let's
57:43 - talk about what is going on in open
57:45 - source because I think few people have
57:47 - their finger on the pulse of Open Source
57:49 - like you and Adam do and you especially
57:52 - doing these like Weekly News uh updates
57:56 - like you probably I I will say this and
57:59 - and I would love if somebody challenges
58:01 - me in the comments but I would go so far
58:04 - to say you probably know more about
58:06 - what's going on in open source than a
58:09 - lot of the people working in like
58:11 - developer relations at GitHub or places
58:13 - like that where it's like their business
58:15 - to know what's going on in open source
58:17 - uh right what are the big kind of macro
58:20 - Trend what do you see going on
58:26 - so there's a lot like you said um and of
58:29 - course open source is not just one big
58:32 - Community um probably never was there's
58:34 - lots of it's like made up of subcultures
58:37 - you know so there is no such thing as
58:39 - the open source Community because like
58:41 - if you said where does open source hang
58:43 - out like you might say GitHub but
58:45 - github's not really hanging out very
58:46 - much you can talk and you can post your
58:48 - code but that's not hanging out the
58:50 - answer would be like nowhere and
58:51 - everywhere you know it's it's on Discord
58:54 - it's in slack it's on GitHub it's
58:56 - hanging out in IRC still it's like all
58:58 - over the place so there's the community
59:00 - side but then there's like what's going
59:01 - on what is the community doing well
59:03 - right now there's a a lot of hubub
59:05 - around relicensing so of course open
59:08 - source uh is defined by the the people
59:11 - who maintain the open source definition
59:13 - at open source.org they call themselves
59:16 - The OSI open source initiative and this
59:18 - was defined back in the 90s and has to
59:20 - be guarded to a certain extent because a
59:22 - lot of people are uh trying to come out
59:25 - with products for sale and call them
59:28 - open source and then they aren't
59:31 - actually open source and so there's a
59:32 - lot of conversation about what it means
59:35 - to be open source or just public or free
59:39 - or these kind of things so that's like a
59:41 - Perpetual debate but it's one that's
59:42 - currently under a lot of scrutiny
59:46 - because the recent releases of for
59:49 - instance meta's llama AI
59:52 - model uh was declared as open source but
59:56 - but has a commercial constraint on it
59:57 - Quincy I'm not sure how up to date you
59:59 - are on all this stuff but that
60:01 - particular la oh it's a very specific
60:04 - commercial constraint I I know what
60:05 - you're talking about a very specific
60:08 - commercial constraint which means it's
60:09 - not open source actually it's it's like
60:12 - almost open source but it's not quite
60:13 - but they're going to call it open source
60:15 - and so this goes down to like well what
60:16 - do words mean and what do you get to say
60:18 - about your thing and so it's a huge
60:21 - debate because a lot of the open source
60:23 - definition going back doesn't actually
60:24 - apply to uh language models or any kind
60:27 - of models for that reason they're just
60:29 - kind of like outdated because they
60:30 - aren't just code they're like code Plus
60:31 - data plus training plus you know this
60:33 - other stuff so that's all going on very
60:36 - fascinating and then we have the rug
60:38 - poles you know we have hashy Corp who uh
60:41 - the purveyor of
60:43 - terraform terraform previously open
60:45 - source this is a a uh infrastructure as
60:48 - code tool um that was previously open
60:51 - source and they recently relicensed it
60:55 - so that it's not open Source anymore and
60:57 - this caused a big stir and a fork and so
61:00 - maybe you've heard of open tofu which is
61:03 - the open source Fork which is a response
61:05 - to the relicensing of
61:07 - terraform that's going on and then IBM
61:10 - bot has you Corp subsequently so lots of
61:13 - lots of details on that particular story
61:15 - but like this whole what really is open
61:18 - source and what isn't conversation is
61:20 - very active and vibrant right now and a
61:22 - lot of the AI models are pushing that
61:24 - because there's a lot of value a lot of
61:28 - Goodwill and intrinsic value in the open
61:32 - source brand making something truly open
61:35 - source that um businesses want to have
61:38 - that but they also don't want to comply
61:41 - to it and so there are um what some
61:45 - people call you know attacks on what it
61:46 - is in order to call your commercial
61:49 - product open source when it's not so
61:52 - that's definitely going on have you been
61:54 - privy to any of that conversation so I'm
61:56 - going to kind of like break it down for
61:57 - some of the people who didn't hear about
61:59 - the terms of uh Facebook's I'll call it
62:02 - Facebook instead of meta they Chang the
62:04 - name but it's still the same uh same
62:05 - people involved uh just just because a
62:08 - lot of people might take a cynical look
62:09 - at at meta and like them trying to
62:11 - Rebrand themelves and stuff just like
62:13 - like alphabet technically nobody calls
62:15 - Google alphabet right even though
62:17 - they've got like this holding company
62:18 - and stuff right but anyway sorry I'm not
62:20 - trying to split hairs or attack Mark
62:22 - Zuckerberg even though as anybody knows
62:24 - like I'm not a huge fan of Mark Zu so uh
62:27 - sure so Facebook spent a ton of R&D
62:31 - creating an open source uh llm that you
62:35 - can essentially it's they they've got
62:36 - like different sizes and stuff and you
62:37 - can run and fre C can't use this
62:39 - internally we use it um we haven't
62:41 - jumped on the chat chat bot bandwagon to
62:43 - like have how can I help you with your
62:45 - coding problem or whatever right like
62:47 - now we just use the form and that works
62:49 - better and you're actually talking to
62:51 - real people and you're learning from
62:52 - real people it's creating artifacts it's
62:53 - not just like throw away you know tokens
62:56 - and and also frankly like it cost a
62:57 - fortune to run a lot of these models um
63:01 - but it's really cool that Facebook open
63:03 - sourced it and made it available to
63:05 - everybody so uh at the same time
63:07 - Facebook realizes like hey you know
63:10 - Amazon could just yo like let's go use
63:13 - this and let's build on top of it in in
63:15 - secret and not contribute it back and
63:17 - all that stuff and like let's do all
63:18 - this so they put a limit I think it was
63:21 - it like 700 million if your service has
63:24 - like 700 million users or more or
63:26 - something like that monthly active users
63:28 - or yeah so fre something like that I
63:29 - don't know the exact
63:31 - number mon active users we might be up
63:33 - there in like 10 years or something but
63:35 - uh yeah I'm not that worried about it
63:37 - because we're not using for commercial
63:38 - purposes or anything free cams and
63:39 - charity and uh as a charity we're able
63:42 - to like use all kinds of stuff and it's
63:43 - not for commercial purposes oh yeah uh
63:46 - and and free C Camp as you probably know
63:48 - if you're listening to this we are also
63:50 - open source and we use the most
63:51 - permissive license BSD three uh which is
63:55 - basically MIT it's just there's a little
63:57 - Clause that protects people from
63:58 - pretending they're free Cod Camp because
64:00 - free Cod camps M work so hard to create
64:03 - this you know positive image and
64:05 - encourage people you know this Vibe and
64:07 - we don't want you know frauders to
64:09 - basically pretend they're free C Camp
64:10 - and like try to defraud people and and
64:12 - fortunately if you don't have trademarks
64:14 - things like that like you you get the
64:16 - people that step in like hey I created a
64:17 - free code camp for my community just a
64:19 - thousand bucks your kids can come and
64:21 - like learn to code right and like you
64:23 - get a lot of that stuff but so the only
64:25 - protection on our repo is that you can't
64:27 - pretend to be free Cod Camp you can use
64:30 - our code and lots of people do they they
64:32 - spin up white labeled versions of free
64:33 - Cod Camp to run uh like lots of coding
64:36 - boot camps were doing this for example a
64:37 - lot of universities do this a lot of
64:39 - people who are in prison are using free
64:42 - code Camp running on a local area
64:43 - network and they may have made like
64:44 - slight modifications to that so that
64:47 - people in America you can't have
64:48 - internet access if you're in prison
64:50 - which I I mean I can see the reasoning
64:52 - behind that but they they need to figure
64:54 - something out because it's a huge impact
64:55 - to people being able to retrain and
64:57 - prepare for the outside world anyway uh
65:00 - this is not a discussion about like
65:01 - those kinds of topics but my point
65:05 - is historically open source was open
65:08 - source like this is what open source is
65:10 - you can't call yourself open source if
65:12 - you're limiting the number of users that
65:14 - a company can have uh just because you
65:17 - don't want Microsoft taking your Tech
65:18 - and like you don't want Amazon taking
65:20 - your Tech and stuff like that like very
65:21 - few Services have more than 600 million
65:25 - users a month like I I think there maybe
65:27 - like few handful name them on maybe two
65:30 - hands yeah yeah and like like probably a
65:32 - lot of Chinese companies maybe some
65:34 - Indonesian companies I don't even think
65:36 - Indonesian because there aren't 700
65:37 - million people in Indonesia right like
65:39 - like you're really just talking about
65:40 - like major apps that are designed for
65:43 - you know Mass market like Facebook has I
65:45 - don't know billions of users right like
65:47 - they don't want they don't want people
65:48 - to take their tools and compete with
65:49 - them so that's one thing and then the
65:52 - other thing uh what you said about uh
65:54 - terraform I didn't even realize that was
65:55 - happening you may have mentioned on
65:57 - Chang log news but I didn't realize that
65:59 - uh they had changed the
66:02 - license where do you fall on this you
66:04 - are somebody for whom open source is not
66:07 - only a passion but it's like what you
66:09 - work in like you are swimming in a SE of
66:11 - Open Source and you're you're kind of
66:13 - taking it and interpreting it and
66:15 - Distilling it for other people to to be
66:17 - able to keep up on top of what do you
66:20 - think about some of these changes yeah
66:23 - you just report the news and try to stay
66:25 - objective
66:27 - well no I mean on the new show I do not
66:31 - not even that I mean on the new show I
66:33 - don't think of like I'm a news reporter
66:36 - or a journalist and I'm trying to be an
66:39 - objective person reporting the news I'm
66:41 - like now I'm a podcaster who pays
66:43 - attention to what's going on I'm Just
66:44 - Jared and I'm going to let you know
66:46 - what's going on why it's interesting and
66:48 - maybe what I think about it sometimes I
66:50 - don't say what I think about it
66:51 - sometimes I do just depends on how I
66:52 - feel about certain things but um the
66:56 - first thing is that it's all very
66:57 - complicated you know this is not easy uh
67:01 - open source meets business is one of the
67:02 - most
67:03 - fascinating little uh intersections of
67:08 - things because of how complicated it all
67:11 - is I mean just even your Nuance
67:14 - description of your license you know
67:15 - which I completely understood probably
67:17 - was lost on a few people not because you
67:19 - didn't do a good job but because it's
67:20 - very complicated to say this license
67:22 - means this but you can't do that you
67:23 - know and there's a set of licenses that
67:25 - are are approved by the open source
67:28 - initiative who are the again the people
67:30 - who Define and defend the open source
67:33 - definition and then there are ones that
67:36 - don't and the ones that don't want to be
67:39 - called that they are and there's reasons
67:40 - for that and it's all very complicated
67:42 - so um it's difficult to say exactly
67:45 - where I land I can speak about specific
67:48 - incidents um Adam and Adam coined a
67:50 - phrase that I've been repeating since he
67:52 - coined it which is rug pole not cool um
67:55 - I think that you should come out and be
67:56 - what you are from the start and stay
67:58 - that I think that people that like what
68:00 - hashy Corp did was not cool because they
68:02 - built this huge Community around open
68:05 - source software terraform and then years
68:08 - years later when it became um against
68:11 - their business interest to continue that
68:13 - way they rug pulled they changed it they
68:16 - made it no longer open source and all
68:18 - these people who had given their
68:20 - resources supported the community
68:22 - whatever they've done over the course of
68:23 - years adopted the technology
68:26 - they all had to Grapple with a decision
68:27 - to make well do we now pay Hashi corpse
68:29 - for terraform or do we Fork it and and
68:33 - do our own thing and they decided to
68:34 - Fork it yeah um reddis is the same way
68:37 - reddis was relicensed recently no longer
68:39 - open source and that one's a little
68:43 - Messier because whereas terraform got
68:45 - like one big group of people that all
68:47 - said we're going to Fork you and create
68:50 - a new one redus has had like six of
68:53 - those Microsoft announced one um well
68:56 - Microsoft announced something very
68:58 - similar a team from abws announced one
69:02 - uh Drew devault from Source Hut
69:05 - announced one so now there's like six
69:07 - red as forks and it's like well which
69:09 - one do I pick which one's going to win
69:11 - you know it's kind of Messier and weird
69:14 - and so I think the whole rug pool thing
69:15 - is not cool and I wish companies
69:18 - wouldn't do that um that being said I
69:20 - understand the business pressures that
69:21 - are on them and why they would do that
69:23 - over time as they're giving away you
69:26 - know they're giving away the goods for
69:28 - so long eventually they're like we need
69:29 - to make money off this I mean like just
69:32 - knee-jerk
69:33 - reaction when you're using open source
69:35 - is basically marketing uh first of all
69:37 - if free Cod Camp is incorporating tool
69:40 - like we don't use generally non-op
69:42 - Source tools I I can't think of any
69:43 - proprietary tools we use we use some
69:45 - proprietary software as of service
69:48 - things like like uh like U for example
69:52 - for authentication we use OCTA like
69:55 - ozero OCT acquired ozero a while back I
69:58 - think um so we used that uh and that is
70:01 - not open source to my knowledge uh and I
70:03 - can understand why like for security
70:05 - reasons they wouldn't want to make the
70:07 - entire you know all their security open
70:09 - source necessarily but uh at the same
70:12 - time uh that's like basically it like
70:15 - every database we use every web server
70:18 - every load balancer every uh you know
70:21 - Library we're incorporating into the
70:23 - free code Camp codebase which has more
70:25 - than 50,000 commits uh SL poor requests
70:29 - I think o over time uh maybe that's
70:31 - GitHub issues I don't know how many uh
70:33 - commits we we could take a look at it
70:34 - but it's a lot that we have thousands of
70:36 - contributors right and they have all
70:38 - come to freeo Camp like hey I'm going to
70:40 - invest my scarce time making this better
70:43 - so I can use it and it's going to be
70:44 - available to for example prison systems
70:46 - it's going to be available to uh you
70:48 - know schools that are out in you know
70:51 - places in Middle America or places in
70:55 - you know Latin America Africa uh that
70:57 - just don't have good internet like I
71:01 - think it's like 15 20% of Americans
71:03 - don't have like really high-speed
71:04 - internet they're having to use you know
71:06 - makeshift Solutions like czy like uh you
71:09 - know the Elon mus satellite thing right
71:10 - stlink which is not nearly as good as
71:12 - just having you know cable modem or
71:14 - something like that right like oh for
71:16 - sure yeah if you live in the city you
71:17 - can get like half half a gigabit or
71:19 - maybe a full gigabit and it's not that
71:20 - expensive right but if you're a little
71:21 - farther out it it can become really
71:23 - difficult to get good internet so so
71:25 - like people might be forking Freo Camp
71:27 - to create computer labs so the kids in
71:29 - the neighborhood can go and like learn
71:30 - locally on those computers right um and
71:34 - people are investing this time and
71:35 - energy with the with the understanding
71:38 - that we're not just going to rug pole
71:39 - we're not just to say hey sorry if you
71:41 - want to use free C Camp like you have to
71:42 - pay us a licensing fee right or um like
71:44 - hey we're just not going to support like
71:46 - you're you're orphaned on that like old
71:48 - version or free Cod camp and all the
71:50 - improvements are going to be on free Cod
71:52 - Camp Pro or something like that right
71:53 - like that is
71:56 - rug not I like it so um yeah like my my
71:59 - sentiment is like what hash Corp has
72:03 - done and it sounds like what reddis has
72:04 - done is like a bunch of marketers and
72:06 - money people uh basically said like hey
72:09 - we we got all this out of it let's
72:12 - Slaughter the Golden Goose and like
72:13 - let's see if there are any gold eggs in
72:14 - it what's going to happen the Project's
72:15 - going to be abandoned eventually there
72:17 - will be some people who are so locked in
72:19 - using that that they just grudgingly pay
72:21 - it's going to destroy trust in the brand
72:23 - it's probably going to people are going
72:25 - to be like putting the the company logo
72:27 - of the acquirer on a dart board and
72:29 - throwing darts at it when they're
72:30 - frustrated with it uh I mean it just
72:32 - seems so value destroying to take
72:34 - something that was working fine I people
72:37 - were making money they just weren't
72:38 - making private Equity level money you
72:40 - know uh it seems like a really greedy
72:42 - play uh so so that is my two cents on
72:45 - that uh again I hope that's not too
72:46 - spicy of a take but like if you start a
72:50 - project you were betraying the community
72:52 - by changing the license on it I would
72:54 - say uh
72:55 - so you know freeo camp like I agree
72:57 - especially if you make yeah yeah
72:59 - especially if you have a certain track
73:01 - record in history of being this way then
73:03 - all of a sudden you're like we're going
73:04 - to go 180 and be the other way I mean
73:06 - you wouldn't like that in a relationship
73:08 - right I mean that would be like what the
73:10 - heck why'd you do that to that would
73:11 - like destroy a relationship possibly
73:13 - yeah yeah and then you know then the
73:15 - meta thing or the Facebook thing if you
73:17 - prefer I'll use Facebook either way fine
73:19 - I just want to make sure people know
73:20 - what we're talking about not go to their
73:21 - Rebrand yeah yeah yeah yeah so the the
73:25 - distinction there is that uh if you look
73:26 - at the open source definition the way it
73:28 - starts is that open source software is
73:31 - software with source code that anyone
73:33 - can inspect modify and enhance and So
73:36 - Meta comes out Facebook comes out and
73:38 - with llama and they say hey anyone
73:42 - inspect modify and enhance except for
73:44 - these set of people over here they can't
73:46 - do it and that goes directly against
73:49 - what open source is I mean it does but
73:51 - and so that's fine if they want to do
73:52 - that they're complete they can do
73:53 - whatever they want it's still I a net
73:55 - good over not releasing anything I'm
73:57 - kind of AAG pragmatist but call it
74:01 - something else yeah well I just I want
74:02 - to jump in in Zuckerberg doesn't care
74:04 - though he's going to call it open source
74:05 - till the day he dies he he's just like
74:07 - very pragmatic in everything he does um
74:10 - but but on a net like on a balance I'm
74:13 - very glad that it's available and that
74:15 - you know freeo camp like the other
74:18 - 99.99999% of organizations out there can
74:21 - use it as though it was and you know
74:23 - like these giant corporations that have
74:26 - trillion dollar market caps and stuff
74:28 - they can just trade money back and forth
74:30 - and and figure out a way to make it work
74:32 - right it's not hurting the little guy
74:34 - and it's actually helping the little guy
74:35 - so I would say uh I think that this sort
74:38 - of thing is fine but I agree it should
74:40 - not be called open source it should be
74:42 - called something else uh open source is
74:44 - a marketing term it just poisons the
74:46 - well it like makes people cynical um
74:49 - like I don't want people contributing to
74:50 - free Cod Camp to stop because like hey
74:52 - free Cod Camp's gonna everybody's just
74:54 - gonna grab their their their rugs and
74:56 - they're going to pack up their stuff and
74:58 - they're going to leave with all our
74:59 - contributions in tow right uh so so I do
75:02 - think it it's it harms the ecosystem for
75:04 - sure um but but again I just want to
75:08 - emphasize Facebook was very transparent
75:11 - in what they're doing I don't like the
75:12 - fact that they use the name but like I
75:15 - will be pretty pissed if they go back
75:17 - and they change the terms uh again to
75:19 - like oh actually if you have more than
75:21 - 10 million because we noticed free Camp
75:22 - was using it and we want free Camp to
75:24 - give us money right like I'll be very
75:26 - upset if uh those terms you know keep
75:29 - changing downward and if this is a trend
75:31 - of like kind of like a tightening of
75:34 - like cranking the ratchet yeah yeah
75:35 - because not every like free Cod Camp has
75:38 - a million people that use it every day
75:39 - right but we don't we're not a
75:42 - multi-million dollar like I'm trying to
75:44 - think of any company that has more than
75:46 - a million people who use it every day
75:47 - that doesn't have any money it's like a
75:49 - tiny charity right like there there
75:51 - really aren't very many like Wikipedia
75:53 - is probably the only other website I can
75:55 - think of that has millions of people
75:56 - using it that also doesn't have just a
75:58 - ton of money now and they've gotten some
76:00 - criticism for having a lot of money but
76:02 - like if you if you look at like hundreds
76:03 - of millions of dollars saved at
76:05 - Wikipedia it's a fraction a fraction
76:08 - apple has a 100 billion dollar in cash
76:12 - reserves hundred billion doll that's
76:14 - like the market cap of like 10 of their
76:16 - competitors or something right just in
76:17 - cash so so criticizing Wikipedia for
76:20 - having like $200 million in their
76:22 - endowment or whatever or it's it's to
76:24 - totally different and I I hope people
76:26 - don't fall for that kind of I guess
76:28 - anti- nonprofit rhetoric CU there are
76:30 - some people that just want to watch
76:31 - nonprofits fail they want to see they
76:33 - don't want to believe that Charities can
76:35 - exist and they don't want to believe in
76:36 - altruism and all this stuff and they've
76:37 - got this weird
76:40 - worldview I don't see how calling things
76:43 - open source that aren't open source does
76:45 - further our cause though as developers
76:47 - who believe right the software wants to
76:49 - be free and also believe that if you
76:51 - build something you should be able to
76:53 - get money from it but like monetize
76:55 - something else don't monetize the open
76:57 - source part of it have like an open core
76:58 - model and I think there are lots of
77:00 - companies that have an open core model
77:01 - or my favorite model and I'm not sure
77:03 - how profitable this is but I met with
77:05 - Jeff Atwood founder of stack Overflow uh
77:08 - co-founder actually with with Joel pulin
77:10 - and I've interviewed both of them on the
77:11 - free cooking podcast uh both both
77:14 - interviews that in my humble opinion if
77:15 - you're a serious Dev you should go
77:16 - listen to they drop so much knowledge
77:18 - but I I do see how uh like with Discord
77:23 - it's free it's open source but you can
77:25 - pay them and you get a nice hosted
77:27 - preconfigured setup and like if you're a
77:29 - busy website owner and you don't want to
77:32 - hire like a freelance Dev have to go and
77:34 - configure this and maintain it and stuff
77:36 - just pay them like a hundred bucks a
77:37 - month and they'll handle the hosting
77:39 - they'll handle the security they'll
77:40 - handle everything so I I think that that
77:42 - is a good model and I think the model of
77:45 - like let's just get a whole bunch of
77:46 - critical mass around this project and
77:47 - then we'll just change the license and
77:50 - sell it to IBM I don't think that's good
77:52 - and I think that's really damaging and
77:54 - it may be good for that that individual
77:56 - firm but it's one of those kind of like
77:59 - uh like tragedy of the
78:01 - commons open source is the comment right
78:04 - the term open source the notion that
78:06 - anybody can contribute to software and
78:08 - this process that takes unpolished rocks
78:11 - drops them in the RO rock tumbler that
78:14 - is open source and you pull out these
78:16 - beautiful polished stones at the end of
78:18 - it because you know given enough
78:20 - eyeballs all bugs are shallow you've got
78:22 - all these devs that care that want to
78:23 - make things better that are volunteering
78:25 - their time like that beautiful process
78:27 - that that we started uh that has been
78:30 - part of the hacker ethic ever since you
78:32 - know personal computers arrived back in
78:34 - the 70s like like we're losing that to
78:36 - cynicism we're losing that uh if if we
78:38 - don't protect this definition of Open
78:41 - Source so yes I am absolutely willing to
78:43 - say llama is not open source right if
78:47 - that means that we can keep open source
78:49 - protected in its current state and you
78:52 - know the bureaucrats over at like OSI
78:54 - probably don't get nearly enough credit
78:56 - for like doggedly defending what what
78:58 - seems like a pedantic distinction but
79:00 - you and I know that it's not a pedantic
79:02 - distinction this is if this Falls it's
79:04 - just like a whole bunch of other
79:05 - dominoes are going to fall and we're
79:06 - going to lose what we
79:08 - have right yeah the the strength of the
79:11 - brand of Open Source if I can just use
79:13 - the term brand even though sometimes
79:15 - that's a has a negative connotation but
79:16 - I mean it really is knowing something's
79:18 - open source it immediately speaks to a
79:20 - lot of people about what that means and
79:23 - the strength of that is how clear it is
79:26 - right like when you say open source I
79:27 - know what that means you know what that
79:29 - means and we can and and all let the
79:32 - Goodwill flow right oh yeah we can use
79:34 - it for our website let's grab it you
79:35 - know of course now there's permissive
79:37 - license and there's copy Left Right
79:40 - license and so there's that little bit
79:42 - of a rift inside of Open Source both
79:43 - those are open source things and so
79:45 - there are nuances there but generally
79:47 - speaking saying something open source
79:49 - means so much to so many people and it's
79:51 - very clear and so yes the people who
79:54 - want to muddy that definition and bring
79:58 - things in and call them open source that
80:00 - aren't they will characterize the
80:03 - Defenders of the definition the OSI and
80:05 - people who believe it's important as
80:08 - pedantic stagy you know whatever word
80:11 - nerds like all kinds of things like
80:14 - nobody cares you're the only ones that
80:16 - care it's like they have to care so that
80:17 - the rest of us don't have to think about
80:19 - it and once that Clarity is destroyed
80:22 - now the basically the the term is
80:24 - destroyed and now we don't know what it
80:26 - means you say it's open source I don't
80:27 - really know what that means anymore and
80:29 - we've lost something that's been really
80:31 - a huge value to so many people around
80:33 - the world 100% And I I just want to make
80:35 - it clear like I use the term bureaucrat
80:38 - not pejoratively I actually believe
80:39 - bureaucracies are good in a lot of cases
80:42 - like they slow things down and in a lot
80:44 - of cases that's what you want you want
80:45 - people whose job it is is to be pedantic
80:48 - and to split hairs and and to really
80:51 - make sure that uh nobody's getting away
80:54 - with like you know moving the uh
80:56 - proverbial Overton window to where like
80:59 - oh this is open source now it's okay
81:01 - it's like it's standard for companies to
81:04 - have all these restrictions on their
81:05 - open source software that didn't exist
81:06 - 10 years ago but now exists so I I just
81:09 - want to be clear if anybody from OSI is
81:10 - listening uh when I use the term
81:12 - bureaucrat I'm not using it pejoratively
81:14 - to imply you know some like dber esque
81:16 - figure in a cubic maze somewhere right
81:18 - like right pointy head pointy
81:21 - boss I think that bureaucracy is a lot
81:24 - like the helicopter parenting right like
81:26 - we need some of that but the problem is
81:28 - that we get steeped in too much of it
81:30 - and everything grinds to a complete Halt
81:32 - and which is why so many people see it
81:34 - as a insult to say bureaucrat because we
81:38 - got too much of it we but that doesn't
81:40 - mean we don't want any of it like we got
81:41 - to have it it's important but we got to
81:45 - also keep it in check just like that
81:47 - helicopter Mom or Dad yeah needs to be
81:49 - needs to keep their safety precautions
81:51 - in check right they should be there but
81:53 - too much actually is damaging and so I
81:56 - agree with you I was using it not that
81:58 - way either but people who will Lobby or
82:01 - will lob insults against the OSI and the
82:04 - work they're doing uh will certainly use
82:07 - it in that way now they are working on
82:09 - an open source AI definition it's not
82:12 - out yet they've been working on it for a
82:14 - while we had the executive director of
82:16 - The OSI on the show sometime this year
82:19 - it's in the feed for those who are
82:20 - interested he's going through the
82:22 - process with the community of like
82:25 - okay great we'll do that yeah he's been
82:27 - defining uh trying to Define what it
82:29 - means open source AI because if you
82:31 - noticed when I read that uh that blurb
82:35 - it's open source software is software
82:37 - with source code that anyone can inspect
82:39 - modify andh that leaves out a a large
82:42 - part of what L what these models are
82:45 - right it's not just source code it's
82:46 - more than that and so the current open
82:48 - source definition doesn't exactly map
82:51 - one to one on these models which is why
82:54 - a lot of the clarity is starting to get
82:56 - muddied and so they're working on coming
82:58 - up with an open source AI definition
83:00 - they're working very hard and it's like
83:02 - a lot of con bureaucrats having
83:03 - conversations but people who are well
83:05 - intentioned and doing good work and they
83:07 - need to get it out soon so that we can
83:08 - start to Define what these models which
83:11 - ones are open source and which ones
83:12 - aren't yeah that's cool uh I'm excited
83:15 - to listen to that episode and again I'm
83:17 - going to link that in the show notes
83:19 - anybody who cares about this I I can
83:21 - totally understand like I'm a developer
83:23 - like a lot of the way I describe the
83:25 - audience for the show approximately one3
83:27 - students onethird working devs one3
83:29 - people that are working in other fields
83:30 - that are trying to transition into
83:32 - developer roles and I can totally
83:34 - understand how if you're like a student
83:36 - or you're like somebody TR to transition
83:38 - in the roles you have more urgent
83:40 - considerations then what is open source
83:42 - you know how do you define open source
83:44 - right but uh I do think like sooner or
83:46 - later like like it's good to give you
83:47 - some exposure to these Concepts and to
83:49 - this frankly this Battleground uh for
83:52 - the soul of Open Source uh
83:54 - and maybe we can talk about some of the
83:56 - other things going on in open source so
83:58 - we talked about like relicensing but
84:00 - what are some of the other macro Trends
84:01 - if you will I don't know I don't like
84:03 - that term macr Trend what are some of
84:05 - the other Trends macro Trends sounds
84:07 - very yeah it sounds very uh Harvard
84:08 - School business okay so like uh the big
84:12 - yeah exactly take me back to my
84:14 - economics days um you know the big Rusty
84:18 - right is certainly happening
84:19 - everything's getting Rewritten in Rust
84:21 - this was a big Push by Josh O's and the
84:23 - fine Folks at let's encrypt like let's
84:26 - rewrite a lot of the internet's core
84:28 - infrastructure which is open source
84:30 - projects you know largely let's rewrite
84:32 - them in memory safe languages
84:33 - specifically rust is the one that's
84:35 - getting most adoptions so there's a
84:37 - whole lot of things that we cover it's
84:38 - like it's X but it's written in Rust
84:41 - it's why but it's written in Rust and so
84:43 - that's currently the you know the
84:45 - porting language everyone's porting
84:46 - things to rust um especially things that
84:49 - were written in C and C++ that being
84:51 - said they're porting everything I mean
84:52 - the Linux jel is accep rust now yeah
84:56 - that's a big deal they're like the sest
84:59 - of Open Source like SAI mean like like
85:01 - kind of like very conservative and like
85:04 - Defenders again yeah yeah so the fact
85:06 - that rust has made an impact even over
85:08 - there even Lon of toal seems to be a fan
85:10 - of it uh and it's hard to make that guy
85:13 - happy right yeah encryption stuff you
85:16 - know uh TLS uh web servers load
85:19 - balancers anything that's running you
85:21 - know the core internet infrastructure is
85:24 - seen rewrites and memory safe languages
85:26 - a lot of them in Rust um go as well but
85:30 - rust seems to be the darling right now
85:32 - in terms of languages there's some upand
85:34 - coming languages which are cool gleam is
85:36 - a really interesting language which just
85:38 - hit 1.0 recently uh we have The Gleam
85:40 - Creator on the show last month very much
85:44 - kind of a a working person's language
85:46 - that has learned type safe learned from
85:48 - a lot of other great languages taking
85:51 - cues from Elixir taking cues from rust
85:53 - from go from Ruby uh from typescript and
85:57 - like trying to create one that compiles
85:59 - to earling code actually so it runs on
86:01 - the earling VM which is like rock solid
86:04 - uh actor modelbased BM that's been
86:07 - powering you know telefony for 40 years
86:10 - I don't even know how long so gleam is
86:12 - cool Tel by the way languages telephone
86:14 - related stuff is how describe it's a
86:17 - fancy sounding word but it basically
86:18 - just means like you know uh switch code
86:21 - and like I don't know yeah like
86:25 - yeah things that we don't think about
86:26 - much like uh remember the term pots I
86:28 - fig learned that one in school PS the
86:30 - plain old telephone system which was
86:32 - like you know copper wires I ran around
86:34 - on poles everywhere and now it's all of
86:36 - course fiber optics the different G's
86:38 - right the cellular networks but so
86:40 - Ericson erlang is from Ericson that's
86:43 - the ER Sony Ericson so coming out of
86:46 - that place in the world very much have
86:49 - been like doing hot code deploys since
86:52 - you know you and I were in diaper so
86:53 - these guys know know what they're up to
86:55 - and so the earling is a very Rock Solid
86:57 - virtual machine and um people are now
87:00 - building things on top of earling such
87:02 - as Elixir such as this new gleam
87:03 - language that's so cool I had no idea
87:05 - that erlang came from like Sony Erikson
87:08 - language yeah now I can see why it's
87:10 - like super old it's been around a long
87:12 - time yeah gleam yeah exactly gleam is a
87:15 - cool name like have you ever seen that
87:17 - movie gleam in the
87:18 - cube like uh Gleaming the Cube 1980s is
87:21 - that is that a Christian Slater
87:24 - skateboarding movie I think so is it
87:26 - about skateboarding is it about what's
87:30 - uh what is gleam in the cube I'm
87:31 - forgetting now it's about skateboard
87:32 - remember we Nam an episode Gleaming the
87:34 - yeah I think it's about skateboarding
87:35 - gaming the cube 1989 there's another
87:37 - great skateboarding or not but Christian
87:40 - Slater 80s movie about Pirate Radio
87:42 - called Pump Up the Volume have you seen
87:44 - that oh yeah Pirate Radio I remember
87:45 - that that's a great movie man I have
87:46 - yeah he stuck it to the m Slater was the
87:48 - man back in the day yeah yeah he's a
87:50 - cool dude he's in Mr Robot he's a cool
87:52 - actor um oh yeah he is yeah Mr Rob yeah
87:56 - uh so
87:58 - uh that's another trend is uh erlang man
88:02 - I still can't get over that Erics I I
88:05 - heard that I've heard people talk about
88:07 - so much over the years and I had no idea
88:09 - um plain old telephone system telephony
88:12 - you're like really shaking loose a lot
88:14 - of the connections in my brain I'm
88:16 - really rattling some things in your
88:17 - brain there Quincy other Trends yeah
88:19 - earling is cool so gleam the rust
88:22 - rewrite there's other language coming up
88:23 - there's one called called uh junee which
88:26 - is trying to be be like a rust successor
88:31 - that's got all of the benefits of rust
88:34 - but a little bit easier to use because a
88:36 - lot of the the hurdle learning rust is
88:39 - allegedly High I've never learned it
88:40 - myself so I can't speak to that but um
88:43 - if anyone wants to learn rust free C
88:45 - Camp does have a fully interactive rust
88:47 - course you can go through and you can
88:49 - learn while coding rust uh so just
88:52 - Google you guys have at all now it's
88:54 - crazy we want to be comprehensive uh but
88:57 - it we don't actually have interactive
88:59 - everything interactive is like we we got
89:01 - a grant from replit and we use that to
89:03 - uh fund development of this course oh
89:05 - nice yeah um that's cool very cool so
89:08 - lots of languages but like let's say
89:10 - you're a developer you're parachuting
89:11 - into Tech in 2024 which is when we're
89:14 - recording this and uh there's a whole
89:17 - lot of you know things whizzing past
89:20 - really quickly right it's like it's like
89:21 - The Fifth Element like all those cars
89:23 - and these giant grids and you just
89:24 - emerge from your like little you know
89:26 - glass coffin you're you're the the woman
89:28 - from Fifth Element though spoiler alert
89:31 - You're The Fifth Element
89:33 - right and and you see all this this
89:36 - crazy world run spoiler horn we'll get
89:38 - you yeah yeah U sorry spoiler alert for
89:41 - a 30o put in there but I know you don't
89:43 - edit yeah so um yeah what are the trends
89:46 - that you think that people should be
89:48 - like tapped into like what do you think
89:50 - that people should be paying attention
89:51 - to how do they find the signal in the
89:53 - noise
89:55 - yes so it depends on what area of the
89:59 - industry they're interested in but let's
90:01 - just take one that most of us touch
90:03 - which is web development because that
90:04 - one's pretty common right like if you're
90:06 - developing for the
90:08 - web which is most people um the trend
90:12 - right now is a return to server side
90:15 - rendering away from client side
90:17 - rendering and single page applications
90:20 - uh mostly powered by react but you know
90:22 - angular Ember
90:25 - uh and friends so a long time for a long
90:29 - time we swung away from serers side
90:31 - rendering right we wanted to have a Json
90:33 - API and a rich client that you deliver
90:36 - to the device that then uh handles all
90:39 - the logic and hits the Json API and
90:42 - renders the HTML for you that has a lot
90:45 - of complexity and
90:47 - drawbacks uh especially around routing
90:49 - especially around hydration especially
90:51 - around performance especially on
90:54 - uh resource constrained devices and
90:56 - networks which like Quincy said even in
90:58 - America we got people on slow networks
91:01 - on Old devices but you go outside of
91:04 - even you know First World countries and
91:06 - you find a lot of people on really old
91:08 - phones on slow networks and turns out
91:13 - that good
91:14 - oldfashioned Dynamic websites rendered
91:17 - by a server and then uh fancified from
91:20 - there progressively enhanced is a tried
91:23 - andr method method that I think people
91:24 - are rediscovering at the
91:26 - moment and so what's old is new again
91:29 - and what's interesting is the old things
91:30 - that have been doing it that same way
91:32 - the entire time uh the react team is now
91:35 - you know rolling out react server
91:37 - components this is very much an attempt
91:39 - to stay relevant in a serers side
91:41 - rendered world and I think they might
91:42 - succeed on that just because they have
91:44 - so much momentum but it's complicated
91:46 - because they didn't start there it's
91:48 - difficult to to completely change the
91:51 - direction in which you think about a
91:53 - program
91:54 - and that's what the react team is doing
91:57 - and they're going to have to bring all
91:59 - the react developers along with them to
92:00 - get there and so so many people have
92:02 - been thinking Client First Client First
92:03 - Client First it's very hard to then
92:06 - think server first unless you have a
92:09 - tool kit that makes that easy to think
92:12 - about and so we're starting to see uh
92:15 - tools like HTM X which is doing that
92:18 - we're starting to see Phoenix a live
92:20 - view which is providing that kind of
92:22 - thing we're seeing that return to Ruby
92:24 - on Rails and kind of a Revival of rails
92:27 - right now because it's just so batteries
92:30 - included to do that traditional web app
92:33 - that it serves most people most of the
92:35 - time pretty well yeah and so very much
92:37 - what's old is New Again returning to the
92:39 - server is new and just a more
92:40 - straightforward lifestyle I think yeah
92:42 - so kind of than the way we've been doing
92:43 - it the last decade Back to Basics like
92:45 - let's get back to what worked good
92:48 - enough that was quick that didn't have
92:50 - the ridiculous front end complexity uh
92:53 - like like like it used to be like people
92:55 - would joke like oh you know like I'm I'm
92:58 - a real program I do backend developer
93:00 - you just do front end you know but now
93:02 - front end is like potentially more
93:04 - complicated than back end in a lot of
93:06 - cases so it is yeah so it's really
93:09 - interesting to to hear that like rails
93:11 - is experiencing a Renaissance if anybody
93:13 - listening to this is a rails Dev and
93:15 - they want to potentially create an
93:16 - up-to-date rails app we do have or rails
93:19 - course we do have a lot of requests for
93:21 - people teaching Ruby on Rails uh and our
93:25 - rails courses are sadly kind of outdated
93:28 - because they not that many people have
93:29 - cared about rails it hasn't been super
93:31 - relevant recently right no it hasn't but
93:34 - the to to the credit of the Rails
93:36 - Community there have been lots of shops
93:37 - that have just keep keep on plugging at
93:39 - rails and keep improving it I was a
93:40 - rails developer originally my first
93:42 - software developer job was working at a
93:44 - rails shop like maintaining this pretty
93:47 - large application telepan related
93:50 - application that would handle like yeah
93:52 - yeah pretty cool
93:55 - so other Trends I'm going to keep asking
93:58 - other Trends until you run out of
94:00 - interesting things to say cuz I'm
94:01 - learning a lot from run out of Trends
94:03 - yeah Okay cool so if we leave web
94:07 - development specifically and we go to
94:10 - kind of what we're seeing on the
94:11 - trending
94:12 - Pages um I think you know AI everything
94:16 - this one's obvious but really just
94:18 - trying to integrate different AI tools
94:21 - and and to land on a toolkit that is
94:24 - approachable and usable by most people
94:25 - most of the time really hasn't came out
94:28 - yet I think olama right now is probably
94:30 - the best one in that that place o l l ma
94:34 - it uh provides easy access to llama but
94:37 - also other models like mistol and
94:39 - probably Google stuff if they put
94:41 - anything out there um people are trying
94:43 - to Grapple with how we as working
94:46 - developers should be approaching
94:49 - deploying right productizing Ai and
94:52 - making our projects better with it but
94:55 - there's just a whole bunch of other
94:56 - things that are like you know I've
94:58 - slapped AI on a thing and just a lot of
95:00 - that I mean it's trending I think it's
95:01 - kind of silliness but it's certainly
95:03 - happening and so most of the trending
95:06 - projects on GitHub right now are AI
95:08 - related and it's been that way for a
95:11 - good 18 months and I'm hoping that it
95:13 - ends soon but I don't think it's going
95:15 - to what's your take I have to get your
95:17 - take AI sure in its current iteration
95:21 - lots of chat Bots like maybe people
95:22 - doing stuff on the back end where
95:24 - they're like having the machine talk to
95:25 - itself and like they're using words to
95:27 - get to evoke sentiments among machines
95:30 - so that it can paint in like a certain
95:31 - style or do stuff
95:33 - like what we we can just do a lightning
95:36 - around like like what are the yeah most
95:39 - interesting and impactful aspects of AI
95:41 - what what is stake and what is
95:44 - Sizzle
95:46 - okay so I've heard the current round of
95:50 - models described as calculators for
95:52 - words and that's stuck with me quite a
95:54 - bit I think Simon willson either coined
95:56 - that or told me about it and somebody
95:57 - else coined it but if you think about
95:58 - them as calculators for words now you
96:01 - can start to see especially we're
96:02 - talking language models I'm not talking
96:04 - image models or sound models but you can
96:07 - start to really think about them in a
96:08 - way that's very useful of course uh
96:11 - anything that is is um generating a
96:16 - prompt for you to be creative around
96:19 - whether Pros or code right so as starter
96:22 - uh autocomplete aut complete on steroids
96:24 - I think is a really valuable tool for
96:26 - anybody because now you've got steroids
96:29 - but they're not injected into your body
96:30 - so they're not going to harm you right
96:32 - um they could harm your over too much
96:34 - steroid use can harm your body I mean
96:36 - they they could introduce bad habits
96:37 - like I was talking with the primagen uh
96:39 - the the YouTube Creator and he said that
96:41 - he found that like he he he called it
96:43 - the uh the co-pilot pause like you type
96:46 - something and you just pause and you
96:48 - wait for copilot to do your job for you
96:50 - and it it how it weaken him as a
96:51 - developer but uh and I turn that off
96:54 - honestly I don't do any autocomplete
96:56 - myself but I've never been an
96:58 - autocompleter as a coder I've never been
97:00 - like types what they call it not type
97:02 - sense uh Intellis sense you know like
97:05 - tab I I tab complete but I don't let it
97:08 - like tell me all the functions that are
97:09 - currently available and all that kind of
97:11 - jazz that so many fancy tools provide
97:13 - because I do not like the I like that
97:15 - the co-pilot pause I really dislike that
97:17 - I think if I was less set in my ways a
97:20 - little bit younger a little bit greener
97:22 - in my development so this is is not for
97:23 - everybody but for me I have to stop and
97:26 - then think about something else which is
97:28 - like somebody else wrote some code I
97:29 - should look at right now and I don't
97:31 - like that code or oh I do like that code
97:33 - so the way that I use the tools
97:35 - currently is to go and ask you know so
97:39 - keep it in a tab basically I'm just a
97:41 - chat GPT and a tab guy at this point in
97:42 - my life and I will go and ask it I'll
97:44 - say hey write me a function that does
97:46 - this you know and I'll then I'll look at
97:48 - it and bring it in or not but the pause
97:50 - the co-pilot pause for me it just throws
97:52 - me out of my flow
97:54 - and I found it very distracting not just
97:56 - with co-pilot but I've tried uh Source
97:58 - graphs Cody I tried tab n and I tried
98:01 - co-pilot um as recently as about six
98:04 - months ago so maybe better now it really
98:07 - rips me out because now I'm not thinking
98:08 - about what I was thinking about I'm
98:09 - thinking about what somebody else is
98:11 - thinking about and I have to then decide
98:13 - to use or or destroy you know so I feel
98:16 - that I'm I'm I'm going to start using
98:18 - that phrase co-pilot cause co-pilot
98:22 - pause but as prompt as a I mean
98:24 - especially when I'm writing code that I
98:26 - don't write very often is very nice to
98:29 - just go you know calculate some words
98:31 - for me that I can judge and throw in my
98:34 - code if I want to um huge Boon a huge
98:36 - Boon for developer productivity and I
98:39 - don't see us going back for sure
98:41 - yeah Jared anything else we should talk
98:44 - about before we let you go back to your
98:46 - six kids and uh yeah everything else you
98:49 - got going on you're a busy man producing
98:52 - several podcasts a week being on a lot
98:54 - of these guest podcasts uh did yeah I
98:58 - guess instead of just asking like super
99:01 - open into question let me ask you what's
99:03 - going on at the change log what are you
99:04 - all most excited
99:06 - about okay well uh as we record this
99:10 - we're headed off to Microsoft build next
99:12 - week Microsoft invited us out to their
99:15 - annual developer conference is it a
99:16 - developer conference I don't know their
99:17 - annual conference where they invite
99:19 - people to the podcast AWS rein or what
99:23 - is it
99:24 - it's like a developer FOC I think it's
99:26 - way smaller than reinvent but yeah I
99:28 - would call it developer focused um it's
99:31 - been a few years since we've been there
99:33 - we used to go to it Ann we did it
99:34 - annually for a couple years and then I
99:36 - think pandemic stopped that and now
99:37 - they're inviting us back um they do a
99:40 - bunch of announcements a lot of it's
99:41 - kind of azure focused it'll be AI
99:43 - focused and you know we get a talk with
99:45 - the people moving and shaking inside of
99:47 - Microsoft which we don't otherwise do
99:48 - very often because we do really camp out
99:50 - more on the open source side of things
99:51 - but hey Microsoft is crossed the aisle
99:53 - you know yeah Darth Vader has taken his
99:55 - mask off and he realized that there was
99:57 - good inside him all along um that is
100:00 - such a such a poyant and accurate
100:03 - description of what we went from linux's
100:05 - cancer to Microsoft actually caring
100:08 - about open source and investing in it
100:10 - talk about a 180 you know that's like
100:11 - the rug push you know it's like the one
100:13 - that we wanted instead of the rug P they
100:15 - rug push it's a fine rug woven by my
100:18 - family yes
100:21 - yeah please take it
100:23 - free here's some free Azure credits too
100:26 - please sign up um so yeah it'll be
100:29 - interesting to talk about Azure and kind
100:31 - of what they're up to there because it's
100:33 - not really a world that I live in and
100:34 - I'm always curious um so we're doing
100:36 - that next week so that's kind of what's
100:38 - what's currently burgeoning but you know
100:40 - just trying to find what's interesting
100:41 - in the world and shine a light on it
100:44 - just the same thing we've always been
100:45 - doing uh have as great have great
100:47 - conversations and share them with people
100:49 - who are interested um our community is
100:51 - really thriving you know we have an
100:52 - active slack Community with people who
100:55 - are really cool and they like to hang
100:57 - out we play games in there there's like
100:59 - a Wordle Channel if you're into like
101:00 - daily games where everyone shares their
101:02 - scores there's conversations around our
101:05 - podcast there's like a channel for each
101:06 - language so there's like little sub
101:09 - niches inside of there it's an active
101:12 - slack but it's not a too active slack

101:18 - not paying attention and it's like quiet

102:08 - ideally be like speaking at the
102:10 - conference if if if I can if anybody is
102:12 - running a conference and wants quy
102:14 - Larson to come to your conference if you
102:16 - will I don't even charge a speaking fear
102:18 - or anything I if you fly me out and put
102:20 - me in a decent hotel where I can you

102:24 - before I go on stage let me know I'm
102:26 - open to it uh and uh yeah just reach out
102:28 - to me cuz I do enjoy meeting people I
102:31 - enjoy learning from people and I enjoy
102:32 - having opportunities to be in the same
102:35 - you know under the same giant roof as
102:37 - Jared and be able to catch up with him
102:39 - yeah right and you know potentially eat
102:41 - a steak so yeah yeah yeah and uh I'm
102:45 - just learning so much from you man and
102:47 - both from your podcast and from this
102:49 - past you know hour and a half
102:50 - conversation you and I just had and uh
102:52 - I'm just so thrilled and relieved that
102:55 - you and Adam have figured out a way to
102:56 - make this work you've built a business
102:59 - over the years uh through you know
103:01 - relevant ads that's one of the things is
103:04 - like I listen to a lot of podcasts and
103:05 - it's just like these terrible Spotify
103:07 - ads like random you know products and
103:09 - services I have no interest in but like
103:11 - I actually really you know a lot of the
103:14 - ads we've heard on change log that's
103:15 - probably influenced decisions that we
103:17 - make around SAS products and stuff like
103:18 - oh yeah you know because they they're
103:20 - hip enough to realize like Jared podcast
103:23 - is worth advertising on uh then that
103:26 - means they probably actually know about
103:28 - open source they probably actually care
103:29 - about contributors it's not just you
103:31 - know a bunch of sales people trying to
103:32 - jam unnecessary products down people's
103:35 - throats right so yeah and we're picky as
103:37 - well like we have the great privilege of
103:39 - being able to pick and choose who we
103:40 - work with so we're not going to take uh
103:43 - money from a company that we wouldn't
103:45 - want our listeners to know about and so
103:47 - because of that our ads are pretty
103:48 - relevant we have a we do have a
103:50 - membership which people sign up for
103:51 - which you can make the ads disappear you
103:53 - know like a direct support kind of a
103:54 - thing and so we like that as an option
103:56 - we have people who sign up for that and
103:58 - they're like hey man uh just happy to
103:59 - support you guys but can I turn the ads
104:01 - back on because I kind of appreciate
104:03 - your ads I find out about new products
104:04 - that way and we're like sorry dude that
104:06 - no
104:07 - that's you made them disappear you can't
104:09 - do like you can still subscribe to the
104:11 - public feed but uh it's not how we
104:13 - designed the program it's kind of funny
104:15 - that's a that's a weird Edge case I am a
104:17 - change log Plus+ member I think I have
104:20 - been for several years and uh
104:23 - support frankly I just listen to the ad
104:25 - feed myself I haven't never bothered
104:27 - like getting the ad free feed so so
104:29 - you're one of those you're a supporter
104:31 - that just supports us but you don't
104:32 - actually listen I mean like if the ad is
104:33 - interesting I'll listen to it or I'll
104:34 - just like double tap on my like little
104:36 - iPod thing but uh on a whole I've
104:39 - learned about interesting things and
104:40 - sometimes your little interview SE
104:42 - segments with you know the founder or or
104:45 - some person like the C of yeah is
104:47 - interesting it's the extra content that
104:48 - I'm getting that I didn't even ask for
104:50 - or even know I wanted uh but yeah man
104:53 - I'm like so glad you all are making this
104:55 - work and that uh you're out there not
104:58 - just reporting what's happening but kind
105:00 - of advocating for open source you seem
105:03 - to care about the fabric of the
105:04 - community and to the extent that you're
105:07 - raising awareness of like you know Rogue
105:09 - polls and things like that and kind of
105:12 - I'm not going to say like naming and
105:13 - shaming because you're very diplomatic
105:15 - in how you do it but like just
105:17 - advocating for Developers advocating for
105:19 - people who volunteer their open their
105:22 - time to tribute to open source and again
105:24 - a huge shout out to the thousands of
105:27 - kind folks who donate their expertise to
105:30 - our charity in our community Through
105:32 - open source contributions I mean like
105:34 - this is what separates the developer
105:37 - Community from everybody else like
105:38 - whenever people are coming in the tech
105:39 - they're like I can't believe people are
105:40 - so forthcoming with information like
105:42 - there's so much free learning resources
105:45 - and like people are so chill they'll
105:47 - just like help you out right like you go
105:48 - to a conference and people are eager to
105:50 - help you out this is like part of hacker
105:52 - culture it goes back to 1970s right if
105:55 - you read hackers Heroes of the
105:56 - revolution information wants to be free
105:59 - right like that kind of ethos the the
106:01 - full quote is information wants to be
106:03 - free it also wants to be expensive right
106:04 - and that's why you know you have people
106:08 - deciding making those decisions like hey
106:09 - we've got valuable information we've got
106:11 - valuable software let's change the
106:12 - license and make people give us you know
106:15 - Enterprise you know pay for Enterprise
106:17 - licenses uses and stuff right but but
106:20 - right you all are kind of like helping
106:22 - uh
106:23 - propagate and maintain that culture of
106:26 - giving and uh like kind almost like a
106:29 - post scarcity you know Star Trek type
106:31 - society that open source represents like
106:33 - sure and for that I applaud you
106:38 - sir well thank you I appreciate that oh
