00:00 - this week I've been building note app
00:02 - with
00:16 - [Music]
00:28 - reactjs
00:36 - [Music]
00:43 - so it's like playing
00:58 - Lego
01:04 - [Music]
01:12 - I just finished the first basic version
01:14 - of not app so for today let's call it
01:17 - that day this app uh with the noes is
01:21 - like a short app to practice I've
01:23 - noticed that react has been changing
01:26 - really quickly I mean the tutorial was
01:29 - from this year here and some of the uh
01:32 - some of the comment some of the methods
01:35 - uh were uh outdated I want to style it a
01:39 - bit more uh because the basic
01:41 - functionality is there so I will come
01:43 - back to it
01:46 - [Music]
01:58 - tomorrow
02:01 - [Music]
02:12 - it's Wednesday and I'm pretty excited
02:14 - today because I just found out that
02:17 - there's first 100 subscribers to my
02:21 - channel it's pretty important uh
02:24 - because you know I haven't been a
02:27 - vlogger before and uh the aim of this
02:30 - Vlog is not to be a vlogger but to share
02:32 - the journey to share the story and to
02:34 - motivate others to learn to code and
02:36 - also to motivate myself because I'm
02:38 - taking a lot from your feedback from
02:40 - your uh from your support the thing is
02:43 - that uh it's better to create for people
02:46 - than to create for just only for
02:47 - yourself because I also take a lot of
02:49 - feedback a lot of motivation a lot of uh
02:52 - con a lot of uh advice uh from you I
02:58 - also had some voices from you that uh
03:01 - what I show is helpful is motivating
03:03 - also for you I love feedback or I would
03:07 - say even better I like feed forward so I
03:11 - don't like feedback so thing that's are
03:14 - just only based on
03:16 - feelings um and they don't give any
03:19 - reasoning I like feedback or even better
03:23 - feed forward which is a kind of feedback
03:26 - that that that gives you also the just
03:29 - ification and makes you move
03:32 - forward this feed forward is the kind of
03:34 - feedback for me that that is aimed to
03:37 - make a person to whom you give it uh
03:40 - develop to go further to motivate this
03:43 - person and I love it so I love this
03:45 - constructive feedback because it makes
03:48 - me grow it makes me get motivated even
03:50 - more to what I'm
03:52 - [Music]
03:58 - doing
04:01 - it's Thursday yesterday in the evening I
04:03 - was fighting with modernizer and my uh
04:08 - app I wanted to have the not dragable
04:10 - but uh on mobile it was a bit of a
04:13 - problem because uh this dragable um
04:16 - destroyed the functionality of the
04:19 - buttons that we're working on Hover it's
04:21 - uh just the app for me for practicing so
04:24 - I hope this enough for now and I will
04:26 - continue on adding other
04:28 - functionalities
04:37 - [Music]
04:59 - today I got a great news to share with
05:01 - you I was chosen as M to uh Tech leaders
05:05 - program this is the program organized by
05:07 - the Polish chapter of women in
05:09 - technology and I'm really excited to
05:12 - take part in it so I was chosen from
05:14 - hundreds of people who wanted to become
05:17 - a m as my mentor I chose Eva and I hope
05:20 - to talk with her really soon and the
05:23 - program is totally for free for us when
05:25 - it comes to mentees and I will have four
05:28 - months of work work with Eva and I want
05:31 - to focus on JavaScript with her and I'm
05:35 - really excited because as I read she's
05:37 - also interested in design and she also
05:40 - programs a lot in JavaScript so I hope
05:44 - that these for months uh will be really
05:47 - really U productive and I hope I will
05:51 - develop simply faster having this kind
05:53 - of Mentor uh so it's like a gift like a
05:57 - gift that I
05:58 - got
06:01 - [Music]
06:10 - we have first day in the evening this is
06:12 - how the app looks right now you can drag
06:14 - and drop the notes you can edit
06:26 - them as you see when they are shorter
06:29 - they do not have this ellipses here uh
06:31 - when they are longer than 30 um
06:35 - characters they got a ellipses so I can
06:38 - drag and drop the
06:40 - notes I can delete
06:42 - them I can edit
06:48 - them save the
06:52 - changes I can also clean the
06:55 - board and add just only my notes
07:05 - as you see when I add a new note in
07:07 - order to differentiate it it from the
07:10 - crowd it has got different color
07:15 - but when I edit it the font color is the
07:19 - same as the rest of notes so this
07:21 - brownish color is just only for the
07:23 - state when a note hasn't been changed
07:25 - yet and it's a new Noe the new nodes are
07:28 - distributed randomly so in order to find
07:31 - it on a huge screen it's better to to
07:35 - have a different
07:42 - color I can clean the board and I
07:47 - can add just only my notes on mobile the
07:51 - position of the buttons is an easy to
07:55 - touch area so it's at the bottom you can
07:57 - also add a note delete a note
08:00 - uh or
08:03 - edited it's just emulation here
08:06 - but it shows what I mean and and you can
08:11 - clean the
08:13 - board to make this work
08:16 - I come measured a few times on GitHub
08:20 - this week and I started with set up of
08:23 - react and started with um setting up the
08:28 - notes and basic functionalities I
08:30 - started building this
08:33 - um app using the tutorial uh however I
08:37 - added also additional functionalities
08:40 - like cleaning the board or um optimizing
08:43 - the performance or styling it up
08:47 - differently I also played with set index
08:50 - of them um because I wanted to make it
08:54 - more real um and if you take something
08:57 - from the bottom it should appear
08:59 - at the Top If You place it
09:01 - here I will leave this app for the time
09:04 - being of course you can add a lot of
09:06 - additional functionalities here or
09:09 - customization for users but uh I won't
09:12 - do it now um because the most important
09:15 - name in it was practicing components
09:18 - States and generally doing the app in
09:22 - reactjs this week I was mostly focused
09:24 - on reactjs and building the node app I
09:27 - was also doing some from free out camp
09:30 - map I've been also learning a bit more
09:33 - about build and install tools I know it
09:36 - need much more practice and using in the
09:38 - projects but at least right now I
09:41 - differentiate them more into to install
09:43 - and build so into those who run the
09:46 - tasks for you and into those that just
09:47 - only install the stuff for you some of
09:50 - them are really complex and I don't need
09:51 - them right now for my projects that are
09:54 - quite small but I got a better knowledge
09:58 - of what is for what practice makes
10:00 - perfect so while using them I hope to
10:03 - learn the most next week I'm going to
10:06 - focus on another tutorial uh connected
10:09 - with react and I want to build another
10:11 - small react app uh in order to practice
10:15 - next week we are also having the Meetup
10:17 - of front and Malaga and I hope to learn
10:20 - a lot about marrying SVG with the free
10:24 - JS keep on doing stay motivated and see
10:27 - you next week
10:30 - I almost forgot
10:35 - [Music]
