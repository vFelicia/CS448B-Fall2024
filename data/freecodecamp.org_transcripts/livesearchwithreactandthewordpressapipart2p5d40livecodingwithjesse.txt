00:06 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jesse today we're going to continue on
00:11 - with where we left off in the last
00:14 - stream so I haven't done any additional
00:17 - work with that so you haven't missed
00:19 - anything
00:20 - I have merged a few pull requests so
00:22 - we'll go over those quickly ready the
00:27 - beginning of our first Pomodoro session
00:29 - and what I want to say oh sorry about
00:38 - not being able to stream yesterday I did
00:40 - do a very short stream on my youtube
00:42 - channel if it was about coding on
00:47 - blockchain with aetherium and solidity
00:49 - so just going through a tutorial if
00:51 - you're interested in in crypto or
00:54 - blockchain programming like distributed
00:58 - apps check that out it wasn't a very
01:01 - good stream at a lot of interruptions
01:03 - and things but I guess it's a little
01:08 - introduction to that kind of thing the
01:10 - link to my channel I think is in the
01:12 - description of this video so we're gonna
01:18 - get started soon I'm gonna give
01:20 - everybody a few more seconds to come in
01:22 - I'm sure some people are just getting
01:24 - their notifications that we went live
01:27 - and hey everyone hey Nicki's in the
01:35 - middle of working on a pool request for
01:37 - the routing so iniki's has just added
01:40 - something to the routing hastily typing
01:42 - some explanation on the pr and github I
01:44 - was just looking at that at that pool
01:47 - request actually so I'll hold off on
01:51 - that and wait and maybe I'll check it
01:53 - out later then if you're in the middle
01:55 - of updating it let's see let me make
02:02 - sure
02:10 - all right I got through most of the pull
02:15 - requests that were open so if you if
02:22 - you're working on this code or you have
02:24 - this running you know locally make sure
02:27 - you do a get pull since some of the code
02:30 - is just changed literally you know five
02:32 - minutes ago I was still merging pull
02:36 - requests okay so up to kind of our
02:42 - normal normal numbers here so I guess
02:45 - we'll get started
02:46 - let me get everything set up we have n
02:50 - grok up and running already so I'm gonna
02:53 - paste that in the live chat for you all
02:55 - so you can click on that link that I
03:00 - just pasted into the live chat and
03:02 - you'll be able to see the website as I
03:07 - work on it and actually there's a new
03:11 - feature now on youtube so i think the
03:14 - live chat now gets saved and you can see
03:18 - the live chat as you watch the replay
03:21 - so as everything came through you you'll
03:23 - be able to see it I think that's really
03:25 - cool I haven't tested it out or anything
03:28 - I just saw the message that that's
03:31 - available today so hopefully that'll
03:34 - work
03:35 - that'll be really nice for all the other
03:38 - people watching later on watching the
03:41 - recordings and let's start our timer so
03:50 - if you're not familiar with this dream
03:52 - I'm doing my regular everyday work as a
03:55 - front-end developer and I do my work in
03:58 - Pomodoro session so 25 minutes of coding
04:00 - five-minute break on the stream we do 25
04:04 - minutes of coding but then during the
04:05 - five-minute break I answer questions in
04:08 - the live chat and then at the end
04:10 - whatever questions are left over I just
04:12 - take a long break and answer all those
04:14 - questions so feel free to ask any
04:17 - questions don't worry if if you're new
04:22 - you know ask ask
04:24 - any questions you need to understand I'm
04:26 - more than happy to explain what's going
04:27 - on here so let's start this up we are
04:30 - working with react which is a JavaScript
04:34 - library
04:35 - oops I should bring the site over so
04:38 - everyone can see it huh
04:40 - there we are and I did say I would show
04:45 - you some of the pull requests that we
04:47 - get we have so let me let me show you
04:55 - we've had just recently I just merged in
05:02 - these one two three these three by J
05:07 - Meza Kappa so thank you so much for
05:14 - those and these were some these are some
05:17 - UI things that have really been
05:19 - bothering me but I just didn't really
05:22 - have the time you know to get to them so
05:25 - I really appreciate that because I mean
05:29 - this this really ends up being a big
05:30 - help you know all these these little
05:34 - things make a big difference in the
05:36 - final product like those details you
05:38 - have no idea how annoying it was unless
05:41 - you maybe you do if you're trying to
05:43 - click it when you'd open up the side nav
05:45 - and try to click here and nothing would
05:48 - happen or try to click here and nothing
05:51 - would happen right and you had to click
05:55 - right on the words for the link to
05:58 - actually open so I was giving
06:00 - presentations and I I didn't get it
06:04 - exactly right and nothing would happen I
06:06 - said that is not not a great user
06:08 - experience and definitely wasn't great
06:10 - during my presentation so that's awesome
06:14 - so now this whole thing should be a link
06:17 - awesome and a definite is a link we also
06:21 - have cursor:pointer now over this icon
06:26 - to let people know that it's a link
06:28 - which we didn't have before and we have
06:31 - some styling on our majors pages that we
06:35 - were working on before we had
06:38 - some issues with with the BR tags to
06:41 - wear on other pages on the news pages we
06:44 - didn't want them because there are a ton
06:46 - of BR tags just here and there and
06:47 - making the formatting look awful well we
06:50 - actually do want to be our tags as they
06:52 - are playing an important role on our
06:53 - major pages so those are the things that
07:00 - J Meza CAPA
07:02 - worked on so it really appreciate that
07:05 - anybody that's interested in submitting
07:08 - pull requests you're definitely welcome
07:10 - to if you need some help let me know
07:12 - don't be afraid to submit something even
07:16 - if it's your first time submitting I'm
07:19 - not gonna yell at anybody or get upset
07:21 - if something's done wrong
07:23 - sometimes I'll just accept the pool
07:26 - request and if one or two things need
07:27 - fixed I'll just fix it after I accept
07:29 - the pool request
07:30 - other times I may just point out the
07:32 - things that need changed and you could
07:33 - submit the pool request again so this is
07:36 - very beginner friendly when I help as
07:39 - many people as I can to you know get get
07:42 - pool requests in and build up their
07:44 - portfolios with you know legitimate and
07:48 - helpful contributions to this project
07:51 - and all the other projects that we work
07:54 - on okay so that was a lot of intro oh no
07:59 - oh no I you would only see my face the
08:03 - whole time I'm sorry everyone I'm sorry
08:07 - I didn't have OBS like it was behind
08:12 - some other stuff so I couldn't tell all
08:14 - right sorry buddy real quick
08:18 - this is what I was talking about these
08:20 - entire items now are linked so you used
08:22 - to have to click on just the text now
08:25 - it's a link
08:26 - this now is cursor:pointer and that's
08:30 - pretty much that's pretty much it I had
08:33 - showed that the last three pull requests
08:35 - if you want to see him there
08:37 - the last three closed pull requests in
08:39 - the repo I'm really sorry about that
08:43 - that was bad that was a long time of me
08:45 - showing things so apologies to everyone
08:51 - and John mentioned my gray beard hairs
08:56 - again so I I deserve that one for for
09:01 - making you all stare at my face while I
09:04 - was thought I was showing you my screen
09:08 - okay oh cool so Joey's Joey did the pool
09:14 - of those last three pool crests and he's
09:15 - here Joey thank you so much those were
09:17 - just like perfect exactly what I wanted
09:20 - I really liked it and some of the
09:23 - solutions were totally different than
09:25 - how I thought I would solve it and I
09:26 - really liked it
09:27 - especially how you when you put in the
09:32 - code here I'll show you just quickly how
09:36 - I did this so in a in our CSS our new
09:41 - CSS that we're importing here we
09:45 - basically wanted to keep all the CSS and
09:47 - my thought was well let's make a whole
09:50 - nother stylesheet and import it here and
09:52 - this is so much more simple
09:55 - he just said on the root component and
10:00 - putted this in for all BR tags did
10:05 - display unset that's awesome I didn't
10:08 - even know you could do unset but really
10:13 - cool I think that's oh it's so much
10:15 - better than than what I was thinking of
10:17 - doing so I really love that that's one
10:20 - of the big benefits for me of having to
10:22 - review pull requests I learned so many
10:24 - good techniques from you all what I'm
10:26 - trying to review the pull requests I
10:28 - read pretty much every line of every
10:31 - pull request so now I'm not talking
10:36 - about like NPM packages and stuff that
10:38 - you pull in of course I'm not reading
10:40 - that but like the actual code that was
10:42 - at it I definitely you know check that
10:46 - all right so now cool Joey says it was
10:54 - my first open source contribution other
10:56 - than just fixing Doc's awesome
10:58 - congratulations congratulations I'm
11:01 - really happy for you Joey you didn't
11:03 - text
11:03 - job so you should you should definitely
11:06 - be proud of your your first you know
11:09 - code contribution okay so let's go to
11:15 - our search component in our last episode
11:21 - we were working on this search component
11:24 - and we got it working to the point where
11:27 - we could search for a certain keyword
11:30 - and it would search across multiple post
11:34 - types in our WordPress database and
11:37 - using the WordPress REST API we would
11:41 - get the results back as a JSON file and
11:47 - then we would map over those results and
11:51 - display the titles of each one of those
11:54 - posts that that matched our keyword so
12:01 - now what we would want to do is well two
12:04 - things definitely need to happen right
12:06 - away one we need to figure out why we're
12:09 - only getting ten results no matter what
12:11 - word we put in so it's probably
12:15 - something that I need to add to our to
12:19 - our string to our URL where we're you
12:22 - know sending our requests and secondly
12:26 - we need to make a better looking user
12:29 - interface for this search right now it's
12:31 - a very basic search bar and the search
12:34 - button or not stout at all and the
12:36 - results aren't aren't styled so today
12:38 - will be more about the styling whereas
12:42 - last the last episode the last stream
12:47 - was more about the mechanics of how are
12:51 - we going to format our query and get the
12:56 - data back now we're gonna try to make
12:59 - that data look nice
13:05 - I do I see some questions in there so I
13:08 - just want to let you all know if you've
13:09 - asked a question I will get to those
13:11 - questions as soon as or my timer goes
13:14 - off here this Pomodoro timer
13:22 - okay so let's actually let's try to go
13:25 - to that search page no it's not working
13:34 - anymore
13:42 - what's up with this phase cannot be
13:48 - property data of no
14:04 - hmm
14:13 - that's weird alright let's check out our
14:16 - page here and see what we're doing
14:46 - okay maybe it's trying to read the data
14:49 - here and we don't have it so alright so
14:58 - we're gonna try to do a check here first
15:00 - then see if that exists No
15:19 - okay so say we have stayed at all did we
15:25 - even initial I know we didn't States
15:35 - data
15:40 - let's just initialize data as didn't
16:06 - plan on starting this with an error
16:09 - search gives an error in masters well
16:12 - let's see okay I think it has something
16:17 - to do with at the very end of the
16:20 - episode keep saying episode it's we need
16:23 - to say that the end of the last stream
16:25 - we were already on that page and we are
16:28 - grabbing data without a page refresh and
16:31 - I think that was it like it didn't there
16:35 - was always data there in state so it
16:39 - wasn't causing an error but now that
16:41 - we've just tried to load it again and
16:43 - state is basically empty then we're
16:47 - getting the error so I cannot refer you
16:52 - Tate oh no I think my check is wrong and
16:55 - I should've let's see I need to go back
17:04 - and look how I check for similar things
17:06 - previously since I for some reason just
17:10 - can't remember how I do it
17:18 - and spread it in zero right
17:38 - I don't know I already was doing the
17:42 - check you're right
17:43 - Nicky I already had a ternary there I
17:47 - already was checking for this state data
17:51 - but it wasn't working there we go okay
17:57 - now it works I believe the problem was
18:00 - that I didn't actually have anything
18:02 - here for data so at some point that
18:08 - state does get set but down here it was
18:12 - trying to check to see hey if if if this
18:15 - say data exists you know then move on
18:20 - but there was anyway you get what I'm
18:23 - saying right so we forgot to initialize
18:28 - our state within just data but just
18:31 - having it be an empty array so let's
18:33 - let's just test this verify that's
18:35 - working and there's no more bugs before
18:37 - we move on so just do a simple word yep
18:41 - all right cool
18:43 - so it is working here's what it would
18:48 - gave us alcohol the titles I'm gonna do
18:52 - a refresh yep okay again yep awesome it
18:57 - works so sorry I gotta change my Spotify
19:22 - okay
19:26 - michael says you need to knock on your
19:28 - wall and tell him to keep it down can
19:29 - you hear there is a conversation going
19:34 - on right outside my door to my office so
19:36 - apologies for the noise there all right
19:45 - so let's style let's tie our search bar
19:51 - first we'll get that search looking
19:56 - better actually do you even want that
20:10 - I don't think we need alright let me
20:13 - know what you think do we want a
20:17 - separate search bar on the search page
20:20 - or is it enough to just have a search
20:23 - bar here or here I mean I I guess on
20:30 - mobile I can see an advantage to having
20:32 - another search bar because you would
20:34 - actually I mean either way you'd
20:36 - actually have to click again let me know
20:40 - what you think yeah so what I'm gonna
20:45 - hold off on styling this for now I'll
20:47 - leave it there but I'm not gonna style
20:49 - it if we end up deciding we don't even
20:51 - need another search bar so for now I'm
20:55 - gonna try to give these just some basic
20:57 - style and try to get more than 10 to
21:00 - show up and where is this I think I can
21:08 - look let me look at a previous project
21:18 - because I know we use this previously
21:20 - and we got more than 10 results for sure
21:23 - so we're going to go to this
21:25 - catechetical Institute site where we
21:28 - pulled some code from before and where
21:33 - we pages resources and let's see what
21:40 - we're using here there we are so we have
21:42 - this per page 100 so let's put that in
21:49 - here
21:59 - let's save it and now we go back here
22:06 - let's try it again
22:09 - there we are okay so now we're getting a
22:13 - lot more so essentially we can get 100
22:17 - results back now so we don't even have a
22:22 - hundred piece of content we're gonna
22:26 - eventually I think we'll have to think
22:28 - about like do we really want a hundred
22:30 - results should we go like 20 at a time
22:32 - and then give the option to load more
22:37 - you know do what do we want to go with
22:39 - like infinite scroll style I mean these
22:43 - are all things that we will have to
22:46 - decide but we don't have to decide right
22:50 - now so I just want to bring them up so
22:53 - that we can all think about them but
22:55 - what a better user experience would be
22:57 - and then we can try it out and it you
23:01 - know it's one of those things that could
23:03 - easily be changed down the road where we
23:05 - know if we get feedback from real users
23:07 - you know could definitely do something
23:09 - you know differently okay
23:17 - I check my time all right about six
23:20 - minutes so let's see what we can do with
23:22 - six minutes of your styling some of this
23:28 - first thing we'll do is let's grab
23:31 - another component and pull it in here
23:35 - these are probably going to be these
23:38 - will be cards
23:43 - let's think how we want to display these
23:56 - alright let's just let's go with
23:57 - something really simple for now I think
23:59 - I'm gonna do I'm not gonna try to use an
24:02 - existing component just now originally
24:05 - my idea was to have this all like you
24:09 - know cards of multiple columns of cards
24:13 - but I have a different idea now I think
24:18 - I'm gonna make the search results look
24:20 - more like like a Google search or
24:23 - something similar a users are I think
24:26 - more familiar and comfortable with that
24:28 - so that's what I'm gonna go with for
24:32 - this that also frees us up a bit because
24:36 - with the cards I know if I do the card
24:40 - style I'm gonna get feedback from other
24:42 - people here at the University of you
24:45 - know can we put some images or some
24:47 - video in there then that's that's just
24:50 - going to be a little bit extra you know
24:51 - more things to handle more things to
24:53 - load and I don't know that that would
24:57 - necessarily enhance the experience we
25:02 - could certainly have one type of search
25:05 - that's a video search or an image search
25:10 - that we can have that content but I
25:13 - don't like the idea of mixing the
25:15 - content together and having it display
25:17 - if that does pilot can see it in my head
25:21 - hopefully that makes a little bit of
25:23 - sense but it's difficult to make just
25:27 - text content look good if it's in this
25:31 - kind of masonry layout alongside
25:34 - primarily video content or image content
25:38 - you end up depending on the screen with
25:41 - it just looks weird so I'm gonna try it
25:45 - like this I'm gonna stop talking and try
25:47 - it just try to do something now so let's
25:52 - see yeah I'm in the right spot so right
25:55 - now we just have divs each one of these
25:57 - is a div what we're gonna want to do now
26:00 - though is so we want to keep this as the
26:03 - title certainly
26:12 - yeah let's let's keep this as the div
26:16 - here but then let's make this let's go
26:24 - the mage I'm just gonna make this a span
26:33 - for now
26:38 - and we're gonna call this class name
26:50 - title whoops classes title whoops there
27:00 - we go
27:01 - what does that classes it's not define
27:05 - yeah we didn't define it
27:07 - let's forward some classes
27:18 - oops I put that in the wrongs now that
27:21 - was the right spot but then I also need
27:25 - to bring in with styles
27:50 - ten how you do this what am I doing
27:53 - wrong
28:08 - yeah I'm messing this all up
28:18 - alright let me just go back for now what
28:26 - am I missing from these other pages with
28:32 - style styles
28:34 - I'm bringing in I bring this in oops
28:50 - with styles and now maybe this will be
28:56 - better
28:57 - so don't need a data let's see with
29:03 - styles
29:24 - shoot food is the with root here do I
29:27 - need this
29:36 - let's see alright
29:43 - Jilly saying maybe export default with
29:49 - rude with style stuff it alright let's
29:52 - try that alright let's try that
30:09 - okay cool oops yeah use one okay now
30:19 - we're getting classes is not the fun all
30:22 - right my timer went up went off so we're
30:25 - gonna get this working when I get back
30:28 - and here's why this isn't working
30:31 - I never defined classes okay so I'll
30:37 - define classes when we get back taking a
30:45 - break is nice because when I stop trying
30:46 - to look for the problem and I took three
30:48 - seconds to take a break I realized I
30:50 - never defined it that's why it's saying
30:52 - it's undefined of course all right I'm
30:56 - gonna go to the top of the live chat and
30:58 - answer the first questions first see how
31:01 - far we can get down the the chat gospel
31:09 - says I'm just a beginner in programming
31:12 - I had a study C C++ Java but I couldn't
31:17 - no coding till now okay cool um I think
31:26 - that you're saying that this stream is
31:29 - helping you learn how to code effective
31:31 - coding so that's awesome I'm really glad
31:34 - if that's the case what you're saying
31:36 - I'm really really glad that that helps
31:39 - you out so thanks for watching feel free
31:41 - to ask any questions
31:46 - step 7 it's ste pienso Stepan says hello
31:52 - Jesse I'd like to ask how to learn how
31:54 - to integrate HTML to WordPress how did
31:59 - you learn doing this
32:02 - where'd I learn about this I guess there
32:07 - weren't really a lot of tutorials
32:10 - available when I started to learn I'm
32:13 - assuming you're talking about using the
32:15 - WordPress API like this I started using
32:19 - the API before it was a part of
32:22 - press corps so kind of early on and they
32:27 - were on version two at that point so it
32:29 - wasn't like right at the beginning but I
32:33 - just read through the documentation and
32:36 - tried to find any info I could on on
32:39 - blogs and things like that and then just
32:41 - tested things out so it was kind of it
32:47 - was kind of tough honestly at first
32:50 - there's a lot more information now yeah
32:54 - but I was just kind of you know kept
32:56 - trying out so you definitely need to
32:57 - know how to make you know requests to
33:01 - the API so whether you want to use you
33:03 - know Ajax
33:04 - or fetch or Axios or you know something
33:07 - like that so learn how to make requests
33:11 - API
33:12 - you know calls with JavaScript and then
33:16 - WordPress installs come automatically
33:18 - with the API now so you can get data
33:22 - right off the bat you know with any
33:24 - wordpress site that is up to date
33:35 - Mayor s why won't you develop this site
33:39 - using WordPress or laravel or it's just
33:42 - personal preference well we are kind of
33:44 - so we're using WordPress for the content
33:47 - management and we're pulling data from
33:48 - there I prefer the front-end and you
33:52 - know all the things that the user ends
33:54 - up seeing and is not wordpress i my
34:00 - wordpress i think is great for a lot of
34:02 - use cases but if your goal is to make a
34:04 - site that's very versatile and fast as
34:09 - well as having the capability to be a
34:12 - progressive web app I don't think
34:15 - WordPress is the easiest system to use
34:18 - so that's why I like to go with react
34:21 - react has a lot of those capabilities
34:23 - and depending on how you build it with
34:28 - next or create react app a lot of those
34:30 - capabilities come built in so it it
34:35 - gives me a lot more freedom to more
34:38 - quickly change things and add features
34:41 - than it would if I worked with WordPress
34:44 - now if I was very skilled with PHP it
34:47 - might be easier for me to change a
34:50 - wordpress theme but I'm Way more
34:55 - experienced with JavaScript than I am
34:57 - with PHP so this this worked well for me
35:01 - and I like the fact that my data is
35:06 - decoupled from my the rest of my my
35:12 - front end there because it gives me the
35:14 - ability to pull in data from different
35:16 - sources
35:17 - - totally migrated to something else if
35:20 - I wanted to either with the front end or
35:24 - the back end because they're not tightly
35:27 - coupled like normally in a wordpress
35:28 - install if you do things normally with
35:31 - themes you know the look of your site
35:34 - and your WordPress installation are all
35:36 - together so it would be very difficult
35:39 - to say like hey I love other site looks
35:41 - but you know what I don't want to use
35:44 - WordPress anymore for this I want to
35:45 - switch to
35:46 - let's say Drupal well essentially that
35:50 - means you're going to completely rebuild
35:51 - your site and have to transfer all your
35:54 - data I mean I guess you could
36:00 - potentially say no you have to if you
36:04 - didn't like if you like the look but you
36:06 - didn't want to deal with the WordPress
36:07 - back-end you'd have to redo your whole
36:10 - site this way what we could do is say ok
36:12 - let's transform press data somewhere
36:15 - else and just pull it into the site just
36:19 - like we were doing before might have to
36:23 - change a few things in where we're
36:25 - making the API calls but essentially
36:29 - your site can remain to you from a
36:32 - user's point of view exactly the same
36:33 - even though everything behind the scenes
36:35 - has changed yeah so those are some of
36:43 - the benefits that I see from having them
36:45 - decoupled or not doing it kind of the
36:47 - traditional WordPress way all right
36:52 - obviously as you can see my timers up
36:56 - let's see where I'm leaving off
37:08 - I mean just write down where we're
37:11 - leaving off so I can go right back there
37:21 - okay all right let's go back I do need
37:25 - to take a drink I have a new G fuel
37:28 - shaker by the way so G fuel if you're
37:31 - watching sponsor me this is the New York
37:34 - comic-con shaker which I got for free
37:37 - for ordering G fuel when there was a
37:40 - sale or something some reason today abs
37:50 - like super thirsty my mouth is dry
37:53 - truthfully I think I'm like right on the
37:55 - the verge of being sick I did take some
37:59 - pain medicine because my throat is
38:01 - starting to hurt and kind of swell up so
38:04 - I didn't want it to be a problem for the
38:06 - stream so it took some pain medicine but
38:09 - that's all why you make it through to
38:11 - the weekend I have I have another
38:15 - presentation tomorrow and I need to give
38:21 - that presentation and then I'll be okay
38:25 - I don't know if I'll be able to stream
38:26 - tomorrow though actually because my wife
38:28 - is going on a retreat this weekend so
38:30 - she's gonna be gone overnight on Friday
38:34 - and get back at some point Saturday
38:36 - evening so I need to get out early and
38:39 - get the kids from her and then pick up
38:42 - my older ones from school and my older
38:47 - ones are gonna spend the night at my
38:48 - parents house on Friday so I will still
38:51 - have the baby so it's going to be kind
38:54 - of weird for me to just that me and the
38:56 - baby at home so we'll see how that goes
39:03 - I mean I'm I'm perfectly capable of
39:05 - taking care of the baby but it's just so
39:06 - weird to have like an empty house okay
39:13 - what did I break before we left off
39:16 - another I broke something
39:18 - hello okay this these classes right so
39:24 - let's just pull in well yet am I not
39:35 - using no I'm not using it here where am
39:38 - I using it here classes I guess it would
39:47 - have been faster for me not to try a
39:48 - copy and paste that Oh
40:05 - don't need these all right let's see if
40:11 - that works
40:16 - yeah that works
40:18 - awesome let's get rid of that mess okay
40:23 - so now we can't use these these classes
40:28 - so we're gonna make for now just two
40:32 - spans we're gonna make probably make
40:34 - this atone component at some point there
40:37 - may have been something in material UI
40:40 - that would work better for this like a
40:44 - list component maybe we should use that
40:47 - let me just try this first and then
40:50 - maybe we can check out the mature UI
40:52 - documentation quickly to see if there's
40:54 - something pre-made that might be better
40:57 - for us to use rendered so we need to set
41:03 - a title rendered we need excerpt
41:13 - I don't know if we have suitable
41:15 - excerpts for everything we're gonna find
41:18 - out here in a second
41:28 - Wow okay Wow
41:45 - hmm I was not thinking that we would get
41:49 - HTML tags in with our excerpt didn't
41:54 - really want that
42:00 - okay yeah Joey says need dangerously
42:07 - said innerhtml
42:08 - yeah I am yeah that's what we need to
42:12 - display that properly I I think I don't
42:16 - want the HTML to be rendered so that's
42:19 - this kind of a problem with the data
42:20 - right now there may be a better way in
42:29 - WordPress that I could strip out the
42:31 - tags there hmm yeah often work on that
42:43 - WordPress so for now I will display
42:47 - these until like as is so I'm gonna do a
42:57 - little bit of styling here
43:07 - so let's go title we're gonna make this
43:15 - font size 24 pixels it's got 24 pixels
43:28 - font weight font weight is 400 and I'm
43:41 - messing this up there we go and then
43:55 - let's go and then excerpt is gonna be
44:16 - font size 18 pixels and then weight
44:27 - we're gonna set to 300 okay now let's
44:35 - see what kind of a difference this makes
44:38 - this phone is here Johannes why do we
44:43 - have this in here
44:46 - sake get rid of that okay so this is a
44:55 - little bit easier to see where
44:58 - everything is wow that's huge for an
45:03 - excerpt yeah Wow
45:15 - I'm gonna have some serious data cleanup
45:18 - to do if we're gonna be able to do this
45:20 - search like I wanted to
45:46 - Wow
46:09 - michael says at this point we wouldn't
46:11 - blame you for cursing your predecessors
46:14 - yeah alright how are we gonna handle
46:24 - this okay here's what I'm thinking right
46:27 - now we can't rely on the excerpt or
46:31 - content to be in any type of format that
46:34 - it needs to be in I don't think I'll
46:38 - have time but I still don't have a date
46:40 - for launch so I don't know I don't know
46:46 - when we're gonna launch I need to be
46:47 - kind of ready to launch let's say at the
46:50 - end of this month but we could
46:51 - realistically have two more months I
46:53 - don't know so let's say I only have till
46:58 - the end of this month before we launch I
46:59 - don't think there's any way that I can
47:01 - go through every piece of content and
47:03 - clean this up or even add in an extra
47:07 - field of my own type of description I
47:11 - can't do that so I think we're gonna
47:16 - have to just stick with the titles of
47:18 - the pieces of content
47:27 - yeah it's got to be that so we should
47:33 - have alright let's have the data that we
47:40 - can have this should be somewhat decent
47:43 - the titles they will need some work but
47:46 - that's a lot easier than changing large
47:48 - chunks of text so I I probably would
47:52 - have time to go through and change
47:53 - titles and then the content type so we
47:58 - can display the content type and the
48:02 - title in between those things perhaps we
48:05 - can give the user enough information
48:12 - alright let's do that the third thing
48:14 - that we need to worry about that I don't
48:16 - think will solve today's where do we
48:18 - then send the user right
48:25 - like what right now WordPress has no
48:31 - idea what the page URLs are so when we
48:36 - display this do we are we trying then to
48:40 - send the user to a page and the site or
48:44 - would we want to just display the full
48:48 - content to the user I mean they're gonna
48:53 - expect to go to a page right yeah I mean
49:00 - I think we need some way to link up the
49:06 - main place where a piece of content
49:09 - would exist on the page to a URL
49:17 - based on a content type we should be
49:22 - able to do that okay I just want to get
49:33 - that out there so we can think about it
49:35 - I'm not gonna try to solve that problem
49:37 - today what we are gonna do today is try
49:40 - to pull in content type and let's try to
49:44 - pull in well we already have the titles
49:51 - we're actually we're going to need to
49:52 - put the titles in through what's the
49:58 - dangerousness at enter HTML because we
50:01 - have special characters like this that
50:02 - won't display without it alright so
50:05 - let's do that let's do that now let's
50:07 - get rid of this and instead put item
50:15 - I think it's type so item type and then
50:22 - let's go to to uppercase is a thing
50:28 - right to up for kids so it is alright
50:32 - and instead of this let's put let's call
50:37 - this type and let's change this a bit
50:46 - type and we're gonna make this I guess
50:55 - that's fine we didn't really have to do
50:57 - to uppercase there we could have done it
50:58 - in CSS yeah let's get let's get rid of
51:02 - this because let's do it in the CSS the
51:07 - reason I'm going to do this is because
51:09 - this is gonna come through kind of weird
51:11 - and actually it's probably going to have
51:14 - some hyphens in it so we may need to
51:16 - pull those out but for now let's do text
51:22 - this text transform yeah text transform
51:30 - there's an uppercase or capitalized I
51:36 - think it's uppercase and then for this
51:46 - we need to do dangerously set enter HTML
52:01 - it's an HTML like that yeah equals and
52:05 - then what are we doing in here is it
52:09 - double
52:10 - I think it's double I always have to
52:13 - look this up HTML and I think this is
52:19 - how you do it okay that looks all right
52:28 - and we do that we don't need this here
52:32 - anymore you can just close that tag okay
52:38 - all right
52:51 - okay so yeah I did something with the
52:54 - dangerously set innerhtml they said it
52:57 - okay so it is capitalized I was right
52:59 - the first time so yeah I definitely want
53:06 - yeah I'm gonna need we're gonna need to
53:10 - transform these somehow at the very
53:15 - least I want the send me my door no I
53:22 - think they're just unloading equipment
53:23 - right in front of my door we need to
53:27 - remove the hyphens but I'm not worried
53:30 - about that for now I just want to get
53:32 - this displaying oops no must be in the
53:44 - form of oh I need double double these
53:56 - yeah all right cool so now we have the
54:00 - special characters this fling and now we
54:03 - know what the type is all right
54:09 - wonderful all right let's check
54:23 - I'm checking the live chat just to see
54:25 - if anyone had any suggestions about what
54:29 - you were just doing Joey says react HTML
54:34 - parser might be better practiced and
54:36 - dangerously set in our HTML yeah you're
54:39 - right that could be better
54:40 - usually when I have like when I have
54:44 - control over what data's being pulled in
54:46 - it's coming from from sources they
54:52 - really like media people my team are
54:55 - gonna be the only people who have access
54:56 - to I don't worry about it as much but in
55:02 - general you're right it is a good it
55:04 - would be a better practice to use
55:05 - something a bit more secure
55:21 - I Nicky's trying to get my attention
55:23 - would is let's see
55:42 - alright I'm not sure what was going on
55:47 - all right so this is not shake my time
55:52 - seven minutes yeah this is not really
55:55 - good looking we could make it a bit
55:59 - better I did say we were gonna check out
56:01 - the material UI documentation so let's
56:05 - let's do that quickly now I think I
56:09 - missed I want to see what that pop-up
56:11 - was no anyway demos
56:17 - there's a list yeah it's not really what
56:23 - I want not the grid let's see what the
56:34 - expansion panels look like yeah I don't
56:40 - think I want expansion panels here
56:47 - that's pretty cool
57:00 - okay so I think we're good with what we
57:02 - have what I'd like to do is add some
57:08 - space between these maybe maybe even
57:16 - will try space it first so okay John was
57:22 - trying to get my attention so what let
57:30 - somebody see what's up John okay mark
57:38 - down to JSX will work what all right so
57:47 - what are we what are we gonna use
57:50 - markdown to JSX for
58:07 - let me know why we should use markdown
58:09 - to JSX
58:10 - I'm not I haven't used it before okay so
58:18 - I want to move this up
58:43 - and let's make
58:53 - let's call this classes starts search
59:04 - results so for our search results let's
59:25 - go with margin
59:51 - all right let's check that out see what
59:56 - it gives us okay
60:00 - a little bit more space you can
60:02 - definitely tell what's what
60:10 - actually this entire thing needs to be
60:13 - placed in our kind of grid that we've
60:21 - had on other pages so
60:53 - constant continue let's shout out let's
60:56 - pull this content container out of here
60:58 - and just try it over here on the search
61:08 - and see what we have
61:13 - layouts
61:21 - he puts this
61:27 - yeah
61:36 - shh-shh alright so this is just some
61:39 - like basic layout styling right now we
61:44 - just want to wrap the container or we
61:50 - want to have a container around all of
61:55 - this
62:12 - he was from oops I was using theme is
62:22 - not defined what's I can't use theme
62:37 - I gotta put theme in here okay and my
62:45 - timer is going off now I'll see if that
62:56 - did it No
63:04 - area okay so now we have a little bit of
63:12 - space there so that looks nicer so
63:18 - basically we just we added this
63:20 - container that gives us various widths
63:24 - depending on how large the screen is
63:28 - that's where these theme break points
63:29 - came into play so these are built into
63:31 - material UI so when we bring in theme
63:36 - we're able to use those built in break
63:39 - points and you can see we we made a
63:42 - container out of this div that just
63:45 - contains all that basically everything
63:47 - on our page
63:49 - you know except the the app bar all
63:54 - right so that's that's as far as I think
64:03 - we're going to get today you can see
64:07 - basically where I'm kind of going with
64:08 - this is that we will have clearly marked
64:13 - content types and then titles right now
64:17 - the titles are a bit of a mess but we
64:18 - are going to clean those up and yeah so
64:26 - I think it'll be we're gonna have to add
64:30 - a link to link users to a page that they
64:33 - can get more information obviously and
64:37 - then we still need to create a bunch of
64:40 - ways to sort the data and filter the
64:42 - data okay
64:54 - so let me just let's commit this then
65:03 - I'll go to the live chat answer any
65:04 - questions that anyone has to get an oops
65:12 - yarn see oh I apologize this font was
65:17 - probably a bit too small for you all
65:20 - sorry about that
65:25 - so it's
65:39 - yeah that's pretty much it
65:45 - [Music]
66:01 - okay great that passed ooh kids push all
66:12 - right so all the changes are now in
66:15 - github and I'm gonna scroll back up to
66:22 - where we left off at in the live chat
66:25 - and I'm also gonna take off my sweater
66:27 - it's really hot in here I don't want to
66:29 - turn on the fan and you know have all
66:33 - that extra noise so excuse me a second
66:40 - it's not even really cold enough for a
66:42 - sweater here I don't know what I was
66:45 - thinking when I wore this today okay so
66:59 - we left off
67:07 - now michael has said just got here no
67:10 - Ambridge today ya know Amber's today if
67:13 - you watch the stream that I did
67:14 - yesterday on on my youtube channel my
67:17 - son Ambrose was there he's three and
67:21 - then my daughter Cordelia is one I'm
67:25 - gonna one-and-a-half something like that
67:26 - was also in the in the video my wife may
67:31 - have made it on I don't know if she made
67:32 - it on camera or not she was in the room
67:34 - and so it got a little crazy with with
67:39 - the kids there and at one point Ambrose
67:44 - was running behind me with just the
67:48 - shirt on and nothing else he went to the
67:51 - bathroom and couldn't put his underwear
67:53 - back on luckily it did not get on camera
68:02 - alright let's get I'm just growing down
68:08 - now looking for questions
68:19 - while it says for search page autofocus
68:22 - the input bar that is a great idea I
68:24 - definitely definitely want to do that I
68:27 - think that's that's an awesome feature
68:30 - the website can I use does that and I
68:34 - love it every time I go there I I
68:36 - noticed that and I'm so thankful that it
68:39 - just saves me a click and usually when I
68:42 - go to can I use like I know exactly what
68:44 - I'm looking for I just want to look at
68:46 - it really fast it's perfect so yeah I
68:48 - definitely want to do that that's a
68:55 - great idea
68:58 - smiler says hi cool beard when I saw you
69:02 - last time you were without a beard I was
69:05 - I was that was probably a while back a
69:07 - couple months ago at least yeah so right
69:10 - now I have have the beard I'm thinking
69:14 - maybe I'll keep it for a while I kind of
69:16 - thought about shaving it recently I
69:18 - don't know let me know what you think
69:21 - should I keep the beard should I shave
69:23 - it I don't know why I'm thinking about
69:27 - shaving it may I'm just getting bored
69:28 - with it but let me know what y'all think
69:38 - michael says you don't need a search
69:40 - page you just need a search results page
69:43 - yeah I mean I I agree but you know
69:47 - essentially a search page in the search
69:49 - results page you're going to be the same
69:50 - thing it's just going to be a page
69:53 - wherever you display results you know
69:55 - the only question is are we gonna have
69:57 - another search for or not either way I
70:00 - mean that the page is going to look
70:03 - almost exactly the same
70:32 - I think there's a discussion about
70:34 - buying laptop versus desktops and
70:37 - different things so I'm not going to
70:40 - read through all that hopefully if this
70:42 - new feature works like it's supposed to
70:43 - on YouTube you all that watch this later
70:45 - will be able to read through that
70:48 - discussion as well trade Oz says hi
70:53 - Jesse your thoughts on typescript I have
70:57 - not used tight script myself
70:59 - I mean I've like read over it in some
71:01 - repos they use it
71:02 - I think typescript is a cool idea I
71:08 - could see how it would be useful
71:10 - I don't like it enough for me to use it
71:15 - but I haven't really had a lot of
71:16 - experience with it so I could see why
71:18 - typescript could potentially be a better
71:21 - way to do things so I wouldn't adopt
71:25 - tight script like across the board but
71:28 - potentially like for a specific project
71:31 - it might not be a bad idea to require
71:34 - typescript on on a project yeah so I
71:43 - don't know I kind of think it's so it's
71:46 - correct me if I'm wrong but the
71:49 - typescript could potentially I don't
71:56 - like it it makes your code I don't know
71:59 - how to say this so this is my take on
72:02 - Titan script like I said maybe I maybe
72:04 - I'm wrong I don't know a lot about it
72:05 - but typescript is basically a more
72:08 - strongly typed version of JavaScript I
72:11 - mean it's it's still JavaScript right
72:13 - but it's it's like this layer on top so
72:18 - potentially typescript would have the
72:20 - same advantages as a strongly typed
72:22 - language it would be harder to write bad
72:26 - code or insecure code so that's why I'm
72:29 - thinking like depending on the project
72:31 - if you really needed you know that those
72:36 - type of safeguards I could see it as
72:38 - being important but on most projects I'd
72:44 - prefer to use regular JavaScript
72:46 - it'd be accessible for more people to be
72:48 - able to read the code and contribute so
72:52 - anyway that's my thoughts and if I'm
72:54 - totally missing the point of typescript
72:55 - please let me know I guess I I have not
72:58 - done that much with it and I've seen
73:00 - very little typescript code so I could
73:04 - be getting it completely wrong see
73:12 - michael says this stream reminds me that
73:14 - I'm not the only geek in the world of
73:16 - course I get upset at my son when he
73:18 - only watches youtube videos with people
73:20 - doing things instead of doing things so
73:22 - here I am Nietzsche says how you updated
73:29 - the branch you used for a pull request
73:31 - when updates happened to the master
73:34 - branch while you're working on it
73:35 - something with a git rebase or as simple
73:39 - as a pool what would be the best way can
73:45 - you let me think yeah I guess you'd have
73:48 - to update your your fork with the new
73:53 - stuff and I can't remember I did this
73:58 - like sometime within the last month and
74:00 - I can't remember how I did it I totally
74:06 - how did I do that it's not something I
74:10 - do enough that I remember and I always
74:12 - have to look it up so yeah I mean I
74:18 - would assume however you normally update
74:21 - your fork that's what you would do and
74:25 - just make sure that your particular
74:26 - branch gets updated with with the new
74:30 - stuff as well
74:37 - michael says d fuel when react drains
74:40 - all your health John says I've heard
74:48 - Django is a good alternative to
74:49 - WordPress I've I haven't worked with
74:55 - Django I've heard it talked about a lot
74:59 - or mentioned a lot I don't really know
75:02 - whether or not like it really is it
75:05 - really would be an alternative to
75:07 - WordPress or it exists kind of in a
75:09 - different class so from what I
75:14 - understand Django would be like it's a
75:17 - PHP framework or library so Django might
75:21 - be to PHP what like angular is to
75:25 - JavaScript something like that I don't I
75:29 - don't know if that comparison is correct
75:32 - exactly but yeah so it seems to me
75:36 - though that Jenga would take a lot more
75:39 - knowledge about coding to use and
75:44 - WordPress you don't have to know
75:46 - anything about coding to use WordPress
75:48 - if you really just wanted to so that's
75:50 - why I think WordPress might be in a
75:51 - different class and ennis it's Enes and
75:59 - it says why don't you put semicolons so
76:03 - I'm using JavaScript style guide it's
76:12 - called like standard style so standard
76:14 - yes and you don't need to use semicolons
76:17 - with that so they're all they're very
76:19 - few and rare cases where you actually
76:22 - need a semicolon or else it changes the
76:25 - meaning of your code so of course in
76:28 - those cases I would most certainly use a
76:30 - semicolon but I've never come across one
76:33 - of those cases in my code not that I can
76:36 - remember so I prefer not to use
76:40 - semicolons because given the choice
76:42 - between writing more and that more doing
76:46 - nothing or writing less
76:49 - of course I will choose to write less
76:57 - but I'm cool with people who like
77:00 - semicolons so this is your entirely free
77:05 - tool of semicolons are not in this live
77:07 - chat
77:20 - michael says the difference this is the
77:22 - difference between front-end and
77:24 - back-end devs the front-end devs want to
77:25 - make it look good the back-end devs want
77:27 - it to be right yeah yeah and I'm like
77:38 - stuck in between right now so I I want
77:41 - it to look good MB right let's see Jeff
77:52 - says can you limit the display text to a
77:54 - certain length
77:55 - I can we could definitely limit the text
77:59 - for now though I think I'm gonna try to
78:01 - just not have the text because I mean
78:04 - the date is not in good shape I'm not
78:07 - even sure that all of our data like all
78:10 - of our posts even have Xers I mean we
78:15 - could just pull in the actual text and
78:19 - this give a little bit of it but I I
78:24 - don't know I think it's going to be
78:25 - weird I'd rather show less and have that
78:28 - less look better then just dump a bunch
78:32 - of stuff on the page that potentially
78:34 - might not even make sense
78:45 - see
78:50 - Joey says there's probably an HTML
78:53 - parser package that could be used I did
78:55 - something like that with Python a few
78:57 - years ago yeah yeah for sure and I think
79:02 - someone mentioned it a little later on
79:04 - in the stream michael says don't do it
79:07 - don't do it was it when I was putting in
79:09 - danger as I said enter HTML it's not
79:13 - quite as dangerous as it sounds as long
79:16 - as you for sure know what's going to be
79:19 - put into that that element well Jeff had
79:29 - mentioned putting a link to the page and
79:30 - your attire you're right that definitely
79:32 - needs to go in there
79:43 - josephus is this Quincy no this is
79:47 - Jessie I just volunteer for free code
79:51 - camp camp Quincy is the man in charge so
79:55 - occasionally he does stop in and in the
79:58 - live chat but I don't think he's
80:00 - watching today
80:13 - michael says was the search a big
80:16 - problem in your previous meeting if not
80:18 - why stress it did come up in one of the
80:21 - meetings think yeah you know and I don't
80:27 - remember exactly what we what I even
80:31 - said about it in the meeting but I just
80:35 - know so the search is a feature that we
80:41 - definitely want oh I know
80:43 - I remember now how it came up yes so it
80:45 - is it did come up there right now people
80:48 - weren't happy with the current search
80:50 - and you know they want it to be better
80:52 - so I did talk a little bit about how the
80:55 - search was going to function so I need
81:00 - to you know come through with that at
81:01 - some point the reason I'm focusing on
81:04 - the search right now is because when I'm
81:08 - not streaming I need to be moving data
81:10 - over and getting it in better shape
81:12 - which is pretty boring so I'm trying to
81:15 - do things on the stream that I don't
81:19 - know a little bit more interesting and
81:21 - have some kind of immediate visual
81:23 - feedback so I think that that's better
81:26 - for streaming so that's why I'm working
81:30 - on the search stuff right now
81:32 - it may not be a hundred percent
81:35 - necessary right now at this point but
81:37 - it's definitely a feature that I think
81:39 - we should have for launch people are
81:42 - going to expect the search
82:08 - okay so John was mentioning markdown -
82:12 - JSX a while ago and I had asked him to
82:15 - explain more about it so he says
82:18 - markdown - JSX will make the HTML markup
82:22 - read as JSX markup even though you're
82:25 - bringing it over that string of HTML
82:31 - okay yeah you're right that that would
82:35 - make sense
82:51 - John says you wouldn't have to bring
82:53 - over all the content but maybe a preview
82:56 - of the first few sentences or so as it
82:59 - shows in the search results yeah
83:09 - Nietzsche says yeah strip the HTML tags
83:12 - from the excerpt and truncate the
83:14 - excerpt
83:29 - Michels say did I do the pull request
83:31 - right what pull request did you do pull
83:36 - request through this repo did I miss it
83:46 - or are we talking about a different repo
83:55 - let me know
84:13 - okay Joey says I didn't use yarn cm I'm
84:16 - guessing I should use that for all
84:18 - future commits yeah Joe please use yarn
84:21 - cm for four commits it's it's okay it's
84:25 - not like a huge deal but we're trying to
84:27 - keep kind of a standard commit message
84:29 - structure so yeah try to use that next
84:34 - time oh excuse me
84:55 - he says get that go time for lots of
84:58 - french fries bye everyone please give me
85:00 - feedback on the PR and get up okay I
85:02 - will try my best to look over that pull
85:05 - request and get you feedback sometime
85:08 - today if I can and Wow
85:11 - I really wish I had lots of french fries
85:13 - I'm kind of hungry right now
85:15 - Oh John Hanson says focus on an employee
85:26 - input field will not work and react when
85:29 - set in the HTML input element has to be
85:32 - set in j/s though it can be buggy
85:35 - depending on what else is announcing and
85:37 - how many other listeners are in use okay
85:40 - that's good to know so that that will
85:42 - not be as easy as I thought it would be
85:45 - okay
85:55 - oh I need to correct something I said
85:58 - earlier so Joey and Nino tell me that
86:03 - Django is a Python framework my
86:06 - apologies I was mixing up Django with
86:09 - laravel sorry about that so for whatever
86:14 - reason I mix up Python or Django and
86:17 - Largo so Django is a framework for
86:21 - Python and then if you want a PHP
86:25 - framework laravel is the way to go so
86:29 - that's the better comparison so
86:30 - comparing I believe and maybe I'm wrong
86:33 - on this too please let me know so
86:36 - comparing Django to WordPress I don't
86:40 - think is necessarily like an exact
86:44 - comparison there but laravel and Django
86:48 - would be a better comparison let me know
86:52 - disclaimer here I haven't worked with
86:55 - any of those frameworks so please don't
86:57 - take my word for this I I haven't taken
87:02 - the time to learn about any of this oh I
87:03 - brush it and just say shouldn't say
87:05 - anything I don't want to mislead anyone
87:14 - ok Michael's talking about the node
87:16 - Resource Manager rebo oh ok Oh
87:21 - Michael off to check that out so I've
87:24 - kind of been like honestly I've kind of
87:27 - been putting that stuff on the back
87:28 - burner burner since I already turned it
87:30 - in and I've had you know a lot of
87:33 - requests coming in for this project and
87:36 - then we have that Java Script AF side
87:39 - project as well which I'm finally
87:41 - starting to actually you'll get ready to
87:43 - do some work on because I haven't had
87:44 - time so apologies oh I'll try to take a
87:49 - look at that
87:50 - as soon as I can alright well I am to
87:56 - the bottom of the live chat so thank you
88:00 - everyone for watching and for all your
88:04 - help and your advice definitely
88:08 - I definitely got a lot of good opinions
88:11 - I always like that gives me a lot to
88:14 - think about and the end result always
88:15 - ends up being way better than what I
88:19 - intended I might be back tomorrow
88:23 - tomorrow I got a short day and I have a
88:28 - presentation I can't remember what time
88:30 - my presentation is so if I do stream
88:32 - tomorrow it may be at a weird time maybe
88:35 - not at our normal time but yeah so make
88:44 - might see tomorrow maybe maybe next week
88:46 - either way I hope you all have a great
88:50 - day maybe a great weekend
88:52 - and hopefully I see y'all back here for
88:55 - the next stream or will work again on
88:58 - this search function all right thanks
89:03 - again see ya
