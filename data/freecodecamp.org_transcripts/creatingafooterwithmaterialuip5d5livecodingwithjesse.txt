00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with jesse
00:13 - um
00:14 - today
00:15 - we make a footer so
00:18 - we've completed
00:20 - well pretty much completed the header
00:23 - or the app bar
00:25 - the the drawer
00:28 - which is our side nav
00:31 - now we're going to move on to the footer
00:33 - i like to start with those things
00:34 - because they're going to be pretty much
00:36 - consistent across the entire site
00:39 - so i like to go with those first that
00:41 - gives us more time to look at it
00:43 - you know kind of
00:45 - perfect it you know it'll be tested more
00:48 - just by us looking at it
00:50 - you know constantly and
00:53 - as we're building out the rest of the
00:54 - site
00:56 - so
00:57 - the footer is probably the least
00:59 - important of those
01:01 - three components
01:04 - a lot of people won't even see the
01:05 - footer
01:06 - but it's still nice to have uh it's a
01:09 - place where you can put a lot of the
01:10 - links that you know especially with
01:13 - higher education there's a lot of
01:15 - regulations and things so
01:17 - uh you know we'll put
01:19 - privacy policy and different things like
01:22 - that you know down there at the bottom
01:23 - you gotta have them there but you don't
01:25 - really want to waste
01:26 - you know prying
01:28 - real estate at the top on things like
01:30 - that
01:31 - so basically we're going to make a
01:32 - footer that matches the colors of the
01:35 - university
01:37 - and has space
01:39 - you know for all those links at the
01:40 - bottom
01:41 - maybe um like an address it's nice to
01:44 - have an address there i think it's
01:45 - pretty common that people look
01:47 - um
01:48 - you know at the footer for contact
01:51 - information
01:53 - so that's the plan today
01:55 - i do have a sore throat so i've been
01:58 - taking zinc lozenges and um like cough
02:02 - drops and things
02:04 - so hopefully i have a cop dropping cough
02:06 - drop in right now so if i sound weird
02:08 - sorry it's the cough drop but
02:11 - i want to be able to get through the
02:12 - stream
02:14 - uh
02:15 - without my throat just
02:17 - getting crazy and me losing my voice
02:21 - the weird side effect is though my taste
02:23 - buds like totally don't work
02:26 - um
02:27 - i just tried to drink something and
02:31 - it it didn't taste at all like it
02:33 - normally tastes so
02:35 - anyway
02:37 - um
02:40 - miroslav says drink more tea actually i
02:42 - did have a cup of tea
02:44 - before the stream as well
02:46 - but the tea bag was really
02:48 - old i just found it laying in the bottom
02:51 - of one of my uh one of my drawers here
02:54 - and i thought why not i'll try it and so
02:57 - the tea was really really weak but
03:00 - anyway
03:02 - all right enough about
03:05 - my uh health problems and beverages
03:10 - let's get started um what did i do since
03:13 - the last time oh harshit
03:15 - harshit added end-to-end testing so we
03:17 - have some new testing so if you um
03:20 - have this repo running locally
03:23 - you'll see some new options for testing
03:27 - and
03:29 - i'm getting a weird okay let me show
03:32 - this now let me change my view here
03:35 - and show you this this error that i've
03:37 - been getting
03:42 - and see what you all think about it
03:45 - so
03:48 - check this out
03:51 - i keep getting this error now it's
03:53 - pretty uh self-explanatory it actually
03:56 - says
03:57 - check out this github repo to add this
04:00 - so i haven't added it yet i did check
04:02 - out the repo it seems pretty simple
04:06 - um
04:08 - so right now it's not it's not breaking
04:10 - anything it just brings up you know a
04:12 - million warnings like
04:16 - oh there's a lot of warnings here
04:18 - uh so you probably need to fix that
04:22 - i'll try it
04:24 - you know doing what it says in this repo
04:26 - first and then see how it goes
04:30 - uh i also think that i fixed the problem
04:32 - we were having where the um the styles
04:35 - just went all crazy and our fonts were
04:37 - um
04:39 - were just really huge
04:42 - so i went in and just
04:44 - there's an example in material ui's
04:48 - beta github repo
04:50 - for using material ui beta with
04:53 - next
04:55 - so i went through the um
04:57 - the appropriate files in that repository
05:00 - and then compared them to our files and
05:02 - i went through line by line our files
05:05 - are were almost identical
05:08 - they were really just
05:11 - two lines
05:12 - that were different so i changed those
05:15 - two lines
05:16 - to make them the same you could check it
05:18 - out it's it's my the last commit that i
05:20 - made i changed some some lines in there
05:23 - so
05:25 - since i've done that
05:26 - the problem has not happened again
05:30 - but i certainly haven't tested it
05:32 - thoroughly so we'll see
05:35 - if i don't see the problem
05:37 - you know at all for the rest of the day
05:40 - i'll be pretty confident that the
05:42 - problem has been fixed but it did seem
05:44 - like there were other people that were
05:45 - having that same problem or similar
05:47 - problems
05:49 - so
05:50 - i guess it's somewhat common
05:53 - all right oops i wanted to show you
05:55 - here's the footer that we have now
05:58 - this will give you a preview of kind of
06:00 - what it's going to look like
06:01 - so
06:02 - we're going to go with this green color
06:05 - i don't usually like having giant blocks
06:07 - of the green color but i think it's it's
06:09 - okay with the footer
06:11 - uh somewhat appropriate
06:14 - we'll have that gold border so it'll
06:16 - kind of match you know what we have
06:18 - going on here
06:21 - you know at the top here
06:23 - uh we'll have the same thing also i
06:25 - changed the background image
06:27 - so we've had the same background image
06:29 - for for a long time uh not just for this
06:32 - project but um
06:34 - i think did we use it for home test we
06:37 - did actually it's not showing up so at
06:38 - one point we were using it for that too
06:41 - so anyway i found this cute little pug
06:43 - dog
06:45 - and
06:47 - i might have to change it because it's
06:48 - just so cute i just want to look at it
06:50 - all the time i don't even want to code
06:51 - anymore
06:52 - um
06:53 - but anyway i thought that would be fun
06:55 - to look at
06:57 - my um
07:00 - my wife's parents have a little dog that
07:04 - looks pretty much just like this except
07:06 - their dog is way fatter than this dog
07:09 - um
07:11 - but uh it reminds me of that dog
07:15 - all right so here's what we're gonna do
07:16 - we'll have our regular green color here
07:19 - and then a slightly darker shade of that
07:21 - color down here for kind of like the
07:24 - the sub footer i don't know what you'd
07:26 - really call it
07:27 - um
07:29 - we're gonna have our our copyright stuff
07:32 - and then all these links
07:35 - for all the kind of legal stuff that we
07:37 - need
07:38 - and uh i think i'll just i'll keep this
07:40 - set up for now
07:44 - and uh if we want to change it later we
07:45 - can
07:47 - uh but it would be good if somebody
07:49 - happens to get to the bottom of the page
07:50 - then you know why not give them an apply
07:52 - button and donate button again
07:55 - since uh that's what we
07:58 - that's what we expect to be the main
08:00 - actions that someone would take and the
08:02 - main things that we
08:04 - want them to do when they get to this
08:05 - site primarily apply but then also
08:08 - potentially donate
08:10 - depending on whether they're a
08:11 - prospective student or not
08:14 - all right so that's the plan
08:16 - uh this was done
08:20 - i believe we we use material ui for this
08:23 - so we can't just grab all the code we
08:26 - can grab some of it
08:29 - um
08:31 - yeah some of it like
08:32 - basically the content i guess
08:37 - i'm pretty sure material ui does not
08:39 - have any
08:40 - type of pre-made footer at least they
08:43 - didn't the last time i checked which
08:45 - wasn't that long ago
08:46 - so
08:48 - these are the components we have so far
08:51 - probably what we need to do what we
08:53 - ought to do is maybe just use their um
08:58 - their grid system
09:01 - to build this out
09:03 - so that's my plan
09:05 - if anybody
09:06 - you know has has used material ui and
09:09 - and
09:10 - has done something like this and knows
09:11 - of a better way to do this maybe more
09:13 - simple let me know otherwise
09:16 - uh let's start out by checking out the
09:18 - grid
09:20 - let's see layouts let's check out this
09:23 - grid
09:27 - so we're going to be using a grid
09:28 - component
09:30 - and
09:32 - this is
09:40 - there we go so we'll have these um
09:52 - let's see
09:55 - we can
09:57 - auto layout we can exactly shift
10:00 - available space
10:03 - okay uh so i guess we'll go with this um
10:10 - full width
10:12 - that seems like that'll fit our use case
10:16 - um
10:21 - yeah let's just copy
10:24 - two classes we have going on here
10:26 - yeah we're we're good
10:28 - um
10:34 - let's grab this grid
10:38 - we'll just grab the whole thing
10:41 - and then
10:43 - we'll get rid of what we don't need
10:53 - okay
10:56 - um let's go over oops almost forgot to
10:59 - set the timer
11:01 - uh so
11:02 - we're going to do
11:03 - we're going to break up the stream into
11:05 - 25 minute periods and that'll be broken
11:08 - up by five minute periods in between
11:13 - so
11:14 - 25 minutes of code five minutes of
11:16 - question and answer we'll try to get two
11:18 - sessions in today and then i'll do
11:20 - question and answer after that
11:24 - uh also i see there's a lot of activity
11:26 - in the live chat so um
11:30 - i'll come back to that if you've asked a
11:32 - question already
11:33 - after this 25 minute session i'm gonna
11:36 - come back and go through everything
11:38 - that's already been in the live chat
11:42 - um
11:43 - i see in general a lot of you are just
11:45 - saying hi
11:46 - uh and uh
11:49 - hey everybody
11:54 - actually someone arivan says say hello
11:57 - to us from brazil so i will do that hey
11:59 - um hey everybody in brazil
12:02 - uh everything thanks for watching
12:07 - okay
12:09 - let's copy that and we'll go over to
12:14 - we definitely want to make this its own
12:15 - component
12:18 - so
12:18 - let's go here in components and
12:21 - make a new file
12:25 - we'll call this footer.js
12:31 - for now i'm going to put everything in
12:33 - this footer component but it's possible
12:35 - that we may want to
12:37 - refactor a bit and extract out
12:40 - you know some of what's going to be in
12:42 - the footer component in it
12:45 - that we'll do in this stream extract
12:46 - some of that out
12:48 - and make it into its own components
12:50 - we'll see how large it gets
12:53 - usually i don't like to have really
12:55 - large components uh if if it's avoidable
12:58 - and usually is avoidable
13:01 - all right so let's um
13:08 - actually let's just grab
13:13 - something here
13:16 - this is really big let me grab
13:19 - the drawer is that smaller
13:21 - yeah this looks smaller
13:22 - let's grab this drawer first
13:30 - yeah let's grab the drawer
13:33 - and
13:34 - let's paste that
13:37 - and then
13:39 - that'll save us some time
13:43 - now
13:46 - let's get rid of all this stuff
13:51 - and paste that in
13:54 - and
13:59 - actually we might be able to just keep
14:01 - grid here so let's let's take out drawer
14:04 - as well
14:05 - let's see what it'll look like with just
14:07 - grid
14:09 - let's get rid of some of this stuff
14:11 - and get rid of this
14:16 - footer
14:17 - and let's change this to footer
14:23 - i don't think we need state
14:27 - but we will need
14:32 - we're going to put one function in here
14:35 - and i'm not going to do it yet we'll
14:36 - save it for a little while later
14:40 - um toggle we don't need toggle drawer we
14:43 - don't need to open
14:48 - and
14:50 - let's see
14:51 - this is full nested function we don't
14:52 - need any of these
14:56 - let's grab
15:01 - let's see what we need really search
15:02 - icon button
15:04 - divider
15:07 - we get rid of all of these
15:10 - and this
15:13 - and that
15:19 - and we're not actually using the prop
15:21 - types right now
15:24 - i don't think we'll have any props to be
15:26 - honest with you
15:28 - um
15:30 - well i guess
15:32 - we'll still have the classes
15:34 - did we even have that in the prop types
15:35 - before
15:38 - no we didn't okay so we don't need those
15:40 - either
15:42 - great
15:43 - so now this is looking
15:44 - a lot smaller which is nice
15:51 - and
15:52 - let's see what kind of grid we need so
15:54 - we'll need
15:57 - let's do it like this
16:02 - so definitely we want
16:04 - small
16:09 - let's change this to
16:12 - i'm assuming this is a 12 column system
16:14 - i guess i'll find out in a minute
16:16 - um
16:17 - so if it's a 12 column system i want to
16:19 - change this to be four columns each
16:25 - on a small screen
16:28 - i just want to get some on here so we
16:29 - can see most likely going to be
16:31 - adjusting this at some point and then i
16:33 - would like this to be 12 all the time
16:37 - and that's going to be our bottom
16:39 - our bottom bar there
16:41 - and then we don't need any of these
16:47 - so
16:49 - all right one two three four yep that's
16:51 - what i want
16:53 - glasses paper oh let's get the styles in
16:55 - there
17:06 - you know what i didn't add that root
17:10 - i don't want to add that
17:20 - let's add this uh
17:22 - root um
17:24 - like we have in the example
17:28 - it says
17:31 - class name classes
17:40 - yeah let's add that in
17:44 - may we may not need it but
17:47 - the closer we get to the example the
17:49 - less likely we are to have any problems
17:53 - okay
17:54 - so not bad let's see okay so we do have
17:57 - some text in here
18:00 - i'll leave that in there for now just so
18:02 - we can see it
18:04 - and
18:12 - that looks alright
18:14 - so i'm going to save that and then let's
18:16 - go to our layout component
18:20 - and let's put in
18:23 - below
18:24 - below this part
18:26 - we're going to put in our
18:28 - footer
18:32 - and then we need to import our footer as
18:34 - well
18:36 - so i'm just going to copy what we have
18:38 - here for drawer
18:39 - and then i
18:40 - can
18:42 - put in footer
18:45 - i'm going to save that
18:46 - let's see if we've done anything
18:50 - ah we didn't import grid
18:53 - i'll see when i read the live chat if
18:55 - anybody caught that
19:00 - i thought i had everything okay
19:03 - so let's see
19:07 - let's grab something here
19:12 - make it easier
19:15 - divider and we'll change this to grid
19:21 - and while we're at it let's double check
19:23 - to make sure you don't have anything
19:24 - else in your paper okay so we'll
19:26 - probably need to import paper
19:39 - all right so grid and paper
19:42 - and i think that'll do it
19:48 - yay okay
19:50 - awesome so we have down here at the
19:51 - bottom
19:52 - full width
19:54 - we have our
19:56 - three
19:58 - uh across here like we wanted and then
20:00 - one
20:01 - below obviously this isn't you know this
20:04 - is not how we want it styled but it's
20:06 - just
20:07 - um
20:09 - just the first step in here so
20:12 - at this point
20:14 - we want to do for sure a few things
20:17 - that container that we put in if you
20:18 - remember that that that div that we
20:20 - wrapped everything in i'm kind of glad i
20:23 - did that now because
20:25 - it'll be good to have a wrapper
20:26 - component so that
20:28 - what we'll do is that wrapper component
20:31 - will put our background color of green
20:34 - that hash that's um 21412a
20:37 - um the hex color
20:40 - we'll put that as the background color
20:42 - on that
20:43 - and then
20:45 - we'll put our border on that as well of
20:48 - course we'll take out all these paper
20:49 - styles we'll remove the paper component
20:51 - completely we don't need that
20:54 - and then at the bottom here we'll make
20:56 - sure that there's nothing here no
20:58 - padding margin anything like that so
21:00 - this is flat on the bottom but on this
21:03 - we'll put a background
21:07 - that's just going to be black
21:11 - but it's going to be transparent
21:14 - so it'll show the green behind it but
21:16 - it'll darken it slightly
21:20 - so i think that'll work so
21:22 - for now
21:23 - i'm not going to worry about content
21:24 - let's worry about getting the colors and
21:26 - the positioning down then we can worry
21:29 - about throwing in some of that content
21:33 - all right we got 15 minutes to do this i
21:35 - think we're definitely gonna at least
21:36 - get that part done and then the second
21:37 - pomodoro session uh will probably be
21:40 - where we throw in some links
21:42 - and uh and some of that content
21:46 - okay
21:47 - so we're gonna get rid of paper we don't
21:49 - need that
21:51 - and
21:52 - we also don't need these styles for
21:54 - paper
21:56 - but our roots now we're gonna put a
21:59 - background
22:02 - color
22:04 - of and let me grab
22:08 - let's grab this color
22:10 - here there we go
22:14 - okay so we have our um
22:17 - the color that i'd like to use is
22:19 - already in
22:20 - our theme
22:22 - our material ui custom theme so we're
22:25 - going to use that when we do it like
22:26 - that it allows us then to go back in
22:28 - later on and we can change our primary
22:30 - color and not have to go and change it
22:32 - in every component
22:34 - works basically just like sas variables
22:36 - do
22:39 - i mean not like the inner functioning of
22:41 - it
22:43 - but in terms of being able to change it
22:44 - in one place and have it change
22:46 - everywhere uh it's similar to how the
22:49 - sas variables are
22:50 - okay so we got the background color
22:53 - there we go
22:54 - and we're going to give it a border
23:06 - top
23:07 - and it's gonna be
23:15 - you know what i don't think i can do it
23:16 - like this
23:22 - let me try it like this but i'm almost
23:23 - positive i've tried to do it before and
23:25 - it didn't work so let's try uh border
23:27 - top
23:28 - solid
23:30 - three pixels and then where's our gold
23:33 - color
23:35 - i thought i had it over here
23:38 - and our style guide
23:44 - i have the style guide open somewhere
23:45 - but i don't know where it is so i'm just
23:46 - gonna
23:47 - open it up again
23:50 - i guess i already had that
23:55 - already using it in the at bar component
23:57 - so i could have just grabbed it from
23:58 - there
24:06 - let's see
24:12 - and we need to remove all of these paper
24:16 - uh elements here
24:21 - read this
24:25 - and this as well
24:32 - okay
24:37 - and let's see how that works for now
24:41 - let's go with um
24:43 - let's add one more style and we're going
24:45 - to say this let's call this sub footer
24:53 - and that's going to be that bottom
24:54 - footer
24:57 - and let's put background
25:00 - background color here
25:02 - and
25:03 - let's go with r
25:05 - g b a
25:07 - and we want
25:10 - 2 5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5.
25:15 - um and then let's go with a point
25:19 - zero point
25:22 - one
25:23 - let's see how dark that gets us here
25:27 - okay
25:29 - and let's add that to this bottom one
25:31 - here
25:34 - and so we'll go
25:39 - class
25:40 - name classes
25:43 - sub footer
25:45 - okay
25:47 - save that
25:49 - oh
25:50 - not bad check it out
25:52 - okay so it looks like we have
25:58 - not not perfect here but
26:02 - oh
26:04 - all right so we do have some weird stuff
26:06 - going on
26:08 - we have a little bit of a problem i
26:10 - guess with um
26:12 - being able to scroll over a bit
26:14 - so
26:16 - we'll sort that out at a different time
26:18 - i don't want to get
26:19 - distracted by that right now
26:24 - it looks like that that's affecting
26:25 - everything
26:27 - um
26:28 - yeah but not bad so we have a border so
26:31 - evidently this did work
26:33 - um i don't know what i did last time
26:35 - maybe i'm remembering wrong but looks
26:38 - like that worked awesome
26:39 - uh let's see so put her back
26:46 - interesting
26:48 - all right well let's just put in
26:51 - some
26:53 - some content uh just to get an idea of
26:56 - how it looks so for now i think i'm just
26:58 - gonna put in
27:00 - i'm just gonna put in some divs
27:04 - actually not even that let's just put in
27:05 - some p tags with some lorem ipsum in it
27:11 - don't i have low room
27:19 - i used to have lower mipsum that just
27:21 - popped up
27:24 - guess not
27:26 - all right let's grab some
27:29 - laura mipsum text
27:53 - and
27:54 - i'm going to use
27:56 - bacon ipsum
28:06 - and let's see what that gives us
28:25 - let's see what we have going on here
28:34 - so
28:36 - we have
28:46 - oh goodness
28:48 - i put the uh the wrong um hex
28:52 - wrong colors here
28:53 - uh
28:55 - i'm afraid to check the live chat and
28:57 - see who called me out on that
28:59 - [Music]
29:05 - let's try it like this
29:11 - there we go
29:12 - so i
29:14 - instead of doing black
29:16 - with
29:17 - a transparent black i did a transparent
29:20 - white
29:21 - so anyway
29:23 - i usually never do that by hand
29:26 - i always
29:27 - copy it from somewhere or
29:31 - use the color picker and dev tools
29:37 - okay
29:38 - cool not bad that's that's pretty much
29:40 - exactly what we want
29:44 - i could probably stand to go with a
29:45 - little bit darker color here
29:48 - let's increase this and do a 1.5 or 0.15
29:52 - see how that looks
29:57 - i like that i like that much better
30:00 - okay
30:02 - and
30:04 - that border looks very thin
30:10 - i'm thinking it's not going to work so
30:12 - it works up here i don't want a huge
30:14 - thick border up here and it works it's
30:17 - it's subtle
30:19 - but that's what i want down here
30:23 - we'll leave it like that for now
30:26 - see what i think about it but
30:29 - it may have to make that maybe just one
30:31 - pixel thicker
30:34 - all right let's check my time here wow
30:36 - six minutes okay
30:42 - all right well let's put in some um
30:45 - some text
30:48 - and so we could use the material ui
30:52 - typography component so i guess let's
30:55 - let's check it out
31:01 - it's not here
31:08 - am i missing this
31:15 - style there we go typography
31:35 - all right let's check it out
31:52 - okay so let's try to use typography and
31:55 - maybe give it a um
31:58 - what's the default the defaults body one
32:00 - so we'll just leave it
32:01 - uh blank so we get a default on there
32:04 - and
32:08 - for color
32:15 - actually i don't even know what our
32:16 - secondary set at
32:18 - default we're going to want this to be
32:20 - white
32:29 - okay
32:32 - so for now let's just go in and use
32:36 - typography instead of these p tags
32:45 - oops
32:47 - it's not i wanted to do it
32:49 - like this
32:51 - there we go
32:59 - typography and then we need to bring in
33:01 - typography up here
33:13 - all right let's see if it works
33:16 - did i miss something
33:23 - i didn't really see much of a change
33:33 - let's see what we have
33:40 - let's see what
33:41 - we can do here classes usually stylify
33:45 - the components
33:47 - well let's add a color here
33:56 - footer text and let's go color
34:01 - and let's give it
34:04 - oops
34:08 - okay
34:09 - give it that color we're gonna go font
34:12 - size
34:14 - 16 pixels
34:21 - uh and so then on these typography
34:25 - no
34:26 - just on the first ones
34:29 - we're going to get
34:30 - class
34:32 - name
34:36 - classes
34:39 - let me call this footer
34:45 - footer text
34:48 - all right
34:51 - see what happens
34:54 - oh footer text oops
34:57 - i'm always forgetting the commas here
35:08 - okay awesome so
35:11 - we've got the white text
35:14 - let's check yep we got our font size we
35:17 - wanted uh 16.
35:19 - i may want to make that bigger for the
35:21 - top section
35:23 - leave it smaller down here
35:29 - i think i do i don't know about you but
35:30 - that just looks really small
35:33 - let's bump that up then
35:35 - to 18 and see what it looks like
35:41 - yeah that's that's better
35:44 - [Music]
35:47 - change the line height as well
35:59 - okay
36:04 - all right cool
36:06 - um
36:08 - we definitely need some
36:10 - some padding right
36:13 - need some padding on the sides
36:17 - top and bottom
36:24 - so let's do that for here we can put
36:29 - let's just put some general
36:37 - so we need padding and uh we need our
36:40 - top padding to be
36:42 - let's try eight first we might have to
36:44 - go with 16. so we're gonna go eight
36:48 - and
36:49 - on the sides we are gonna go 16
36:53 - and 16 and we're going to go 16 on the
36:56 - sides especially because we have that
36:58 - scroll bar to deal with
37:02 - and then we'll do 16 on both sides be
37:04 - just to be consistent and then the
37:06 - bottom i want it to be zero for right
37:08 - now because remember we have that
37:10 - section with that different cut
37:11 - background
37:12 - color so
37:14 - we don't want to
37:17 - add padding there because that's going
37:19 - to push that section up and there'll be
37:21 - a small stripe of our original base
37:24 - color so we don't want that so we're
37:26 - going to put the padding directly on
37:28 - that sub footer
37:32 - so padding
37:34 - bottom and
37:37 - that's where we'll have
37:41 - uh
37:42 - eight yeah let's give it eight pixels on
37:44 - the bottom
37:47 - and
37:48 - we want um to push it up
37:52 - push the content up above it right so we
37:54 - have the the
37:56 - padding covered everywhere else except
37:58 - for there
38:00 - so let's do a margin
38:04 - top
38:06 - and
38:08 - first we'll try out
38:09 - 8 pixels and we'll go from there
38:12 - right we want to do a margin and not
38:15 - padding because we did padding top that
38:17 - would make the entire section color
38:20 - included get bigger we don't want that
38:23 - so
38:24 - that's why we went with margin
38:27 - let's save that and see what
38:30 - happens huh
38:33 - okay so we we got a little bit of
38:38 - let's inspect this we got a little bit
38:40 - of what we wanted but not
38:42 - not everything we wanted
38:46 - so we have our padding here
38:49 - so check out that padding
38:53 - whoa
38:55 - and then our margin
39:02 - okay 12.
39:11 - looks like we already had some padding
39:12 - going on there by default
39:15 - so maybe we won't need to do that
39:20 - but i do like the uh the margin
39:24 - all right so let's stop right there
39:26 - because my timer is up i'm going to take
39:28 - a short break now go over some questions
39:30 - in the live chat and then we'll come
39:32 - back and we'll mess around a little bit
39:33 - more with our margin and padding
39:37 - so scroll all the way up
39:40 - and
39:45 - i'll try to get through as much as i can
39:46 - there's quite a bit here in the live
39:48 - chat so we'll see how it goes
39:56 - uh
39:56 - jimmy says hi i'm new hey how's it going
39:59 - uh welcome to the uh welcome to the the
40:03 - live stream
40:04 - and uh feel free to ask any questions uh
40:06 - or put comments in the chat i'd love to
40:09 - hear your opinion on things
40:20 - okay jimmy had asked does does this dude
40:23 - reply so
40:24 - not sure if you're still here jimmy
40:26 - sorry i didn't see that but uh i did
40:28 - explain it earlier hopefully you stuck
40:30 - around and got the explanation that
40:33 - i will i do reply to things in the live
40:35 - chat but during the
40:37 - the breaks that i take to go to the live
40:38 - chat i did try before to
40:41 - you know try to monitor the live chat
40:44 - while i'm coding and uh it ended up
40:48 - not being so good
40:50 - it took forever to code anything
40:53 - and um yeah so i can't can't do that
41:02 - thank you uh for everyone who's giving
41:05 - me suggestions on what to take uh for my
41:07 - sore throat uh
41:10 - i i really appreciate that
41:15 - uh erivon asks what operating system do
41:18 - you guys use to code
41:20 - i'm on mac os right now
41:23 - i almost exclusively use mac to code
41:27 - my servers are usually ubuntu
41:30 - linux
41:31 - and i do have pcs at home but i don't
41:35 - code on them often i
41:37 - i just use them for gaming
41:45 - okay horseshit asked about the end and
41:47 - testing if it works on my machine yes it
41:50 - did work
41:51 - um so
41:52 - yeah it worked it worked perfectly
41:55 - well with the exception of those errors
41:57 - that were on there but that's not due to
41:59 - the testing those errors showed up
42:00 - before i merged your pull request so
42:03 - uh but the the end end testing itself uh
42:06 - worked perfectly so thank you for that
42:08 - hardship
42:12 - rook said that picture is the best the
42:14 - dog yeah that's such a cute dog i want
42:17 - to like get rid of this text now so i
42:18 - could see this dog better
42:28 - oh cool so a heart should ask if we
42:30 - could if i could demo the end end
42:33 - testing yeah so let's do that so
42:35 - i'm going to go yarn
42:36 - test
42:38 - and uh if you have the most the
42:40 - up-to-date version of this on your local
42:43 - machine when you
42:45 - uh when you pull
42:47 - the latest make sure you run yarn to
42:49 - install all the new npm packages
42:52 - but then after you've done that you can
42:54 - type yarn test
42:56 - and we'll see
42:59 - our tests running so those tests passed
43:03 - those were unit tests
43:05 - now this is our end-to-end test so you
43:07 - see it actually did the testing in the
43:09 - browser
43:11 - which is awesome and we can see it even
43:14 - gives us uh
43:16 - timing in milliseconds
43:18 - so
43:19 - really cool
43:22 - if anybody's interested in testing or
43:24 - learning more about it or if you know
43:26 - about it and would like to get some more
43:27 - practice
43:28 - you know feel free to add to the test
43:31 - that we already have on there and then
43:33 - as we add new components if you'd like
43:35 - to write tests for them you know that
43:37 - would be
43:38 - very helpful um
43:41 - i'm still pretty new with testing so
43:42 - i'll do my best to uh
43:44 - keep up to date when we add new
43:46 - components but
43:49 - to to be honest if i'm really like if i
43:52 - have a lot to do the testing is gonna
43:54 - get put off
43:56 - uh that's just i am working on a few
43:58 - other projects right now so
44:01 - i may not be able to put in the time
44:03 - that i i ought to on that
44:13 - uh jesse says uh jesse mcintyre says
44:16 - that pick is awesome philip says i hope
44:19 - the pick is production ready
44:23 - jesse says it's way too distracting
44:31 - yeah as soon as i saw that picture i
44:33 - knew like i have to have this on here
44:38 - okay uh so didn't get through everything
44:40 - in the chat right now but i will after
44:43 - this next pomodoro session
44:51 - so
44:52 - i took a note of where i'm at in the
44:54 - live chat i'll go right back to where i
44:56 - left off uh after the next session
45:01 - and
45:02 - let's see
45:10 - okay
45:11 - all right so
45:12 - we put in some padding and things but it
45:15 - didn't exactly work like i expected it
45:17 - to so
45:20 - let's check out what's going on
45:22 - is it this
45:23 - i might have to pull this over a bit
45:26 - um
45:28 - okay
45:30 - so our footer
45:47 - is supposed to have
45:52 - all right i need to do something else
45:54 - with this
45:56 - let's do it like this
45:58 - um
45:58 - let's take this and dock it to the
46:01 - bottom
46:02 - and
46:03 - let's make this full screen
46:07 - all right
46:08 - so when i do it like this unfortunately
46:10 - i won't be able to make this very much
46:11 - bigger we'd never be able to see
46:12 - anything
46:15 - and also i realize that this section is
46:17 - now covered up
46:19 - but i will do my best to
46:22 - talk about what's going on
46:25 - all right so what we have here that i'm
46:28 - i'm wondering about is we should have
46:31 - padding top
46:33 - left
46:35 - oh goodness it was my mistake i messed
46:37 - it up uh i'm sure you all noticed this
46:40 - already we're mad here
46:46 - all right let's um
46:48 - arrange this a bit better
46:50 - there we go
46:51 - okay so
46:53 - unfortunately i don't know what happened
46:55 - to my brain for a second but this is not
46:58 - how you do positioning
47:01 - so
47:03 - the correct order is
47:04 - top
47:07 - right
47:08 - bottom
47:09 - left
47:12 - why why i didn't remember that at the
47:14 - moment i have no idea but that was our
47:16 - problem so you can see now
47:19 - we have
47:21 - uh our eight or was it eight or sixteen
47:24 - yes sixteen pixels
47:27 - of padding on both sides here
47:30 - and
47:32 - eight at the top
47:34 - at the bottom
47:36 - our container has nothing in terms of
47:38 - padding oh goodness
47:41 - i didn't even think about this but we
47:42 - can't do that right because then we're
47:44 - going to have these little spots here
47:47 - let's fix that
47:50 - so
47:51 - here's what we need to do
47:54 - we have these these grid items here
47:57 - we'll need to put
47:59 - our padding
48:00 - directly into these
48:04 - we can keep top the top padding here
48:08 - so let's do
48:10 - padding top
48:11 - and how did that look
48:14 - okay i think we can go 16 for the
48:16 - padding top so let's do that
48:20 - and then we're going to make
48:27 - let's see footer text
48:31 - let's just go footer
48:34 - footer sections
48:37 - and let's say padding
48:40 - for footer sections and we'll give
48:46 - a we're going to give them padding of
48:53 - zero
48:54 - for the top and bottom and then for left
48:57 - and right let's give them 16.
49:01 - we'll see how this looks
49:03 - it may be too much
49:05 - between sections but uh it's worth a
49:08 - shot
49:10 - so let's put in here
49:13 - in these grids
49:16 - so just those first three
49:19 - class name
49:21 - we're going to say
49:23 - classes
49:25 - dot footer
49:28 - sections
49:31 - great
49:33 - all right now let's see what it looks
49:35 - like
49:36 - and
49:38 - i forgot my comma again
49:43 - goodness
49:46 - i need to get like a little jar on my
49:48 - desk and uh
49:50 - i'll like every time i forget a comma
49:52 - i'll have to put a coin in the jar and
49:54 - then it can go to like some charity or
49:56 - something but then i'll learn my lesson
50:01 - to quit forgetting
50:08 - that didn't work like i wanted it to
50:10 - but i'll learn my lesson to quit for
50:12 - getting the
50:14 - commas in javascript arrays
50:18 - all right let's see
50:20 - here's a grid item
50:24 - oops you know what our padding is being
50:26 - overridden
50:40 - that's fine let's go with a margin
50:43 - instead
50:48 - i don't think we have a margin on any of
50:50 - these yet no no margin but margins will
50:52 - work in this case so
50:54 - yeah let's not try to fight what's
50:55 - already there we'll just switch it up to
50:57 - a margin
51:04 - no
51:07 - all right
51:08 - let's try this let's try to use what's
51:11 - already built in here
51:15 - oh man
51:29 - so
51:41 - okay
51:42 - how about we'll do this
51:45 - let's see if this works
51:49 - instead of putting it on these grid
51:51 - components
51:54 - whoops didn't grab it all
52:00 - instead of the grid components we're
52:02 - going to put these
52:05 - on typography
52:08 - how do we do this
52:10 - can i just do a comma
52:14 - oh goodness no i
52:16 - can't see if i can do a comma
52:20 - classes.
52:24 - footer sections
52:25 - i think i can do that
52:32 - no i can't
52:53 - uh let's oops
53:01 - let's see if that works
53:04 - yeah there we go i need
53:07 - i need to make it an array
53:10 - and then it will work
53:18 - okay
53:19 - all right awesome so we finally got what
53:22 - we wanted that took way longer than
53:24 - expected
53:25 - uh but it's not overall not bad i think
53:28 - we're making pretty quick progress
53:31 - uh
53:33 - and did i find it yes okay i found the
53:36 - issue
53:37 - uh can you all see that here's what's
53:39 - causing
53:40 - our
53:42 - i literally have my face like a few
53:44 - inches away from the screen right now
53:46 - so uh i don't know if you could all see
53:48 - that
53:49 - yeah it's right uh uh right here
53:52 - in the corner the bottom
53:54 - uh right hand corner
53:57 - our
53:59 - our shadow
54:01 - right
54:02 - is not a shadow but you know our
54:04 - i guess our overlay
54:07 - is extending out you know past this
54:10 - so
54:14 - that's where our issue is where we're
54:16 - getting this little section on the sides
54:18 - we definitely don't want that
54:22 - so why is this extending out
54:27 - when
54:28 - oh goodness our grid our grids extending
54:31 - out as well
54:35 - so all of our great items are extending
54:37 - out
54:39 - we don't want that
54:59 - hmm
55:13 - so
55:27 - hmm
55:34 - okay so it's has to do with what's going
55:37 - on here
55:44 - all right
55:45 - let's re uh reload that just to get rid
55:48 - of what i did
56:24 - oh let's
56:26 - continue spacing
56:28 - all right let's check out our grid
56:33 - stuff
56:39 - what's the spacing
57:07 - hmm
57:34 - okay this is our problem here so
57:37 - this is exactly what's happening let me
57:40 - zoom in on that a bit
57:42 - uh so
57:44 - you probably couldn't see this
57:46 - in dev tools because the the
57:48 - it was too small and i think it was
57:50 - covered up by the um
57:52 - by the video
57:54 - feed of my face
57:56 - but there's a negative margin
57:59 - and that's how they're getting this to
58:01 - work so it's the the official width of
58:04 - this grid is
58:06 - 100 of the screen plus 24 pixels and
58:09 - then there's a negative margin all
58:11 - around of negative 12 pixels
58:14 - um
58:16 - so let's see not using the spacing
58:19 - feature and implementing it in user
58:22 - space
58:23 - adding a padding on the parent with at
58:26 - least the spacing
58:34 - value adding overflow x hidden on the
58:38 - parent
58:40 - actually
58:41 - if this works this will be the easiest
58:43 - way let's try it
58:46 - we can try it oops right here in dev
58:48 - tools
58:51 - so the parent
58:53 - would be this so
58:55 - let's go with
58:59 - overflow x
59:02 - hidden
59:06 - all right cool that solves the problem
59:09 - um
59:10 - awesome so we're going to add this here
59:13 - so our root component is our parent and
59:15 - we're going to say
59:18 - we're gonna remember a comma this time
59:22 - overflow x
59:25 - hidden
59:27 - save that
59:28 - and
59:29 - all right
59:31 - so now we don't have our horizontal
59:33 - scroll
59:35 - wonderful
59:38 - we still have what do we have going on
59:40 - here
59:44 - what happened to our
59:49 - our top
59:54 - hmm
59:59 - goodness
60:56 - yeah i want to do this too
60:57 - all right so i'm going to take off the
61:00 - spacing
61:01 - or i think the example said set it to
61:04 - zero i'm going to take that off as well
61:06 - because that's seems like it's
61:07 - complicating
61:10 - a lot of what's going on here
61:19 - so let's check
61:20 - okay good so our padding is now
61:24 - working properly
61:30 - great
61:32 - okay
61:35 - okay
61:36 - great
61:43 - okay
61:44 - that seems to work so um
61:47 - so what we ended up doing then
61:50 - is uh
61:52 - there's this
61:53 - built-in spacing
61:55 - uh property that you can use with the
61:57 - grid container uh component
62:01 - and
62:03 - it was
62:05 - it was kind of messing up what we were
62:07 - trying to do
62:08 - you know manually with our styles here
62:11 - so i just got rid of that
62:14 - i know it's easier for me just to work
62:16 - with the css or the css and js directly
62:21 - uh then to try to figure out
62:23 - you know what i'm what i'm doing here
62:25 - because i know exactly what i want
62:27 - with this
62:29 - footer component
62:31 - so i think it's just going to be a lot
62:32 - faster to do it like this
62:36 - all right let me check my time seven
62:37 - minutes all right
62:43 - okay so let's get some stuff here in
62:45 - this sub footer
62:47 - and
62:51 - yeah that'll be all we
62:54 - will do
62:57 - let's find our example
63:00 - okay yes we just have the copyright
63:03 - and these links
63:15 - let me grab this
63:19 - and for this
63:21 - i want to put a
63:24 - span
63:30 - and within that
63:32 - this is going to be
63:43 - this dot
63:48 - get here
63:50 - and up here
63:53 - we're gonna have
63:55 - get here
63:59 - and
64:01 - this will be
64:08 - what is it
64:10 - i always have to lift this up
64:12 - uh
64:16 - i wonder if we're doing that here
64:18 - already i think we are
64:35 - okay so we just need to get
64:38 - let's say this
64:42 - const
64:44 - uh
64:45 - date
64:48 - today equals new
64:51 - date
64:53 - and then
64:55 - we'll say
65:03 - return
65:04 - i'm going to return
65:08 - date
65:10 - today
65:18 - dot
65:19 - get full year
65:26 - all right
65:33 - all right let's see if that works
65:39 - what do we get yep no it didn't work
66:12 - all right let's see what comes up here
66:23 - so this afternoon components
66:36 - all right what did i do
67:17 - you're still getting it
67:24 - class name looks like
67:35 - and two errors let's see just 44.
67:40 - let's check the first one
67:47 - saying i'm giving it an invalid
67:50 - prop
67:54 - but it's working
68:16 - all right so it's just a prop type thing
68:25 - now this one
68:29 - i'm pretty sure we've done this before
68:31 - in react
68:32 - yeah we have
68:34 - right
68:41 - maybe we haven't
68:45 - uh
68:52 - is this not working
69:18 - hmm
69:22 - okay
69:27 - let me just skip that right now
69:29 - for some reason i'm just not seeing what
69:31 - the problem is i'm sure it's just
69:33 - something silly that i'm forgetting to
69:34 - do or doing wrong
69:36 - um
69:43 - let's
69:46 - we need a little bit of padding here
69:56 - a little bit more than we currently have
69:59 - let's see
70:02 - adding bottom
70:05 - margins up
70:07 - actually yeah we don't have any padding
70:08 - right now so
70:10 - let's add some
70:14 - adding top and let's go with eight
70:17 - pixels on the top
70:20 - good so we have eight on the top eight
70:22 - on the bottom
70:24 - it's pretty slim
70:27 - might have to increase the padding a bit
70:29 - but i i kind of like to have it a little
70:32 - bit more slim i think it looks nicer
70:35 - okay not bad so let's add that padding
70:37 - on the top
70:39 - and that'll be the last thing that we do
70:41 - for uh for this stream in terms of
70:43 - coding
70:48 - let's see you know what we need some
70:50 - padding on the sides as well
70:52 - so
70:53 - let's go ahead and just change
70:56 - our sub footer instead of doing a
70:58 - padding bottom we're just going to do
70:59 - padding
71:00 - and we'll go with that
71:02 - top of 8 pixels
71:06 - and then left and right of 16
71:09 - and bottom of zero since we already have
71:12 - padding on the entire thing
71:15 - wait did we
71:16 - no we didn't
71:18 - are we getting that padding on the
71:20 - bottom
71:32 - oh i had it
71:33 - separately
71:37 - how did i have that stuff for this
71:48 - somehow i had padding bottom on there
71:52 - i'm not sure how
71:53 - okay um
71:55 - let's add eight pixels then and then 16
72:00 - pixels
72:03 - sorry everybody i'm starting a little
72:05 - bit of a headache so i'm just kind of i
72:08 - don't know if i'm making a lot of sense
72:09 - at this point but
72:10 - in general we're getting done what we
72:12 - want to get done okay that looks good we
72:14 - have our
72:16 - the right amount of padding
72:20 - okay
72:21 - all right not bad so
72:23 - uh you know we have
72:26 - you know let's just compare a bit
72:28 - let me get rid of this
72:30 - and uh we'll compare so we have them
72:32 - side by side here
72:34 - uh this is what we are going for
72:37 - and so that looks
72:40 - okay now forget content-wise because i'm
72:42 - not worried about content right now
72:45 - but just in terms of design
72:49 - we basically matched it right we've gone
72:52 - with a little bit thinner subfooter
72:54 - um
72:56 - a little bit thinner of our
72:59 - our top border
73:02 - but
73:04 - we have recreated that design now and
73:07 - this was done with materialized
73:10 - um framework and now we've recreated
73:12 - that with material ui
73:16 - so
73:17 - not bad
73:19 - not bad for uh for two pomodoro sessions
73:23 - and uh especially on a live stream
73:25 - everything takes longer on the live
73:26 - stream
73:28 - okay
73:30 - so
73:32 - let me commit this
73:36 - so you all can see all the code
73:39 - and you know what i'm i'm so sorry i
73:40 - didn't start the ngrok server i
73:42 - completely forgot to start it um
73:46 - my apologies for that
73:49 - like i said i'm just
73:50 - i hope i don't get really sick
73:54 - if i'm gonna get sick i hope i get sick
73:56 - right now and get it over with because
73:57 - we have thanksgiving coming up here in
73:59 - the united states and then uh right
74:01 - after that i have the uh
74:03 - um to talk at the november conference
74:07 - so i wanted one or the other i either
74:09 - need to not get sick or just get sick
74:11 - right now and get it over with
74:13 - um
74:14 - all right anyway let's do a git status
74:16 - and see what's changed
74:19 - layout footer
74:20 - yeah that looks about right
74:23 - git commits
74:25 - and i'm gonna use the am flag to just
74:27 - combine it all into one step
74:30 - git commit am and we'll say add footer
74:35 - components
74:37 - let's run all our tests
74:43 - so now on commit we have what we had
74:46 - before whoa
74:50 - all right okay those are just our normal
74:51 - errors for a second i
74:54 - i got nervous for a second okay so in
74:57 - addition to all the stuff we had before
74:59 - which was our
75:00 - uh unit tests
75:02 - and our auto formatting
75:04 - uh with with linting
75:07 - now we have our end to end tests that
75:08 - run so for now there's not that much
75:11 - going on and i have a pretty fast
75:13 - computer so it all happens quickly
75:17 - hopefully it stays somewhat quick
75:18 - although if we end up getting a really
75:20 - large application at some point on a
75:24 - slower computer
75:25 - that may take longer so
75:28 - but at this point it's entirely
75:30 - manageable
75:31 - and now i'm going to push this up to
75:33 - github
75:39 - awesome so now all the code is available
75:41 - to you at the github repo the links in
75:43 - the description
75:44 - at this point i'm going to try to go
75:47 - through all the questions and comments
75:49 - in the live chat i'll respond to uh to
75:51 - all the questions
75:52 - as best i can
75:54 - uh if
75:56 - for those of you maybe can't stick
75:57 - around for the q a session thank you so
75:59 - much for watching i really appreciate it
76:03 - and i will
76:05 - most likely be back tomorrow around the
76:07 - same time assuming my
76:10 - my sore throat doesn't
76:12 - get any worse
76:15 - all right so i left off here
76:20 - let's see
76:23 - i left off in in a discussion between a
76:25 - few of the uh live chat participants so
76:28 - i'm going to skip through that
76:32 - okay rook said that keyboard shortcut he
76:35 - used
76:36 - uh is super useful so the one where i
76:38 - selected
76:40 - um the text so let's go down here
76:44 - so i would highlight something and then
76:47 - hit command d or control d if you're on
76:51 - windows
76:52 - and it highlights everything
76:56 - that's the same
76:57 - right so it's kind of like doing a find
77:00 - except uh it's a lot faster and it
77:03 - immediately highlights that and then
77:05 - it's i think it's called multiple
77:07 - cursors and then you can see i can go in
77:09 - and tab over or type things right
77:13 - and i can type in three places at once
77:17 - not it's very useful it's not as
77:18 - powerful as doing a you know find and
77:21 - replace
77:22 - but if you only have a few things that
77:24 - you need to change it's faster than
77:27 - doing a find and replace
77:29 - so normally if i have
77:31 - well like less than 10 things that i
77:33 - need to change
77:34 - i do
77:37 - the control d or command d
77:40 - the multiple cursors
77:41 - otherwise
77:43 - i go with the control fine
77:46 - but super useful i remember
77:50 - first time i found out about that it was
77:52 - like blew my mind it's like wow this is
77:54 - the coolest thing
77:55 - i think i found out about it on
77:58 - will stern's
78:00 - youtube channel
78:01 - um
78:02 - it's uh learn code academy
78:05 - and um
78:06 - that was it was just
78:08 - it looked really cool when i saw it for
78:10 - the first time
78:20 - all right
78:27 - and yeah she says hello hey yeshu how's
78:30 - it going
78:43 - and
78:45 - all right n is here she says hey hey
78:47 - anna how's it going thanks for watching
78:49 - also says your project looks cool
78:52 - awesome i'm glad you like it
78:55 - let me know uh if there's any
78:58 - anything i could change with that
79:01 - to make it look nicer
79:12 - okay tim asks uh jesse what's cms so
79:15 - what content management system is the
79:17 - old site using
79:18 - is the database behind it public
79:20 - wondering if it can be just migrated to
79:23 - something else and wrapped into a docker
79:26 - container
79:28 - that's a good thought as far as i know
79:29 - the database is not public i need to
79:32 - double check that on friday
79:36 - i think is it friday no no i think it's
79:38 - next week i think next tuesday i'll have
79:41 - a meeting with some of the people from
79:44 - the it department and i'm going to ask
79:47 - them more about the database
79:49 - at that meeting
79:51 - the content management system is called
79:53 - ektron
79:54 - so e-k-t-r-o-n
79:58 - so
80:00 - i haven't come across many people who
80:02 - have ever heard of it let alone worked
80:04 - with it i try not to work with it as
80:06 - much as possible
80:08 - uh it's it's not very user friendly at
80:11 - least the way it's set up for us who
80:13 - knows maybe there's
80:15 - maybe it can be better than it is but
80:19 - in its current state right now it's
80:22 - it's frustrating for the people that
80:24 - have to manage the content
80:37 - uh yes she says hey jesse why don't you
80:39 - install this package it's a teletype
80:42 - it's an atom package
80:45 - using this people can collaborate with
80:47 - each other actually that looks really
80:49 - cool
80:50 - i might have to try that out
80:52 - i'm not gonna install it right now on
80:54 - the stream but um
80:57 - that sounds like it would be really cool
80:59 - to use especially on like some side
81:01 - projects i could see that being really
81:03 - fun or a good teaching tool that would
81:06 - definitely be a good teaching tool i
81:07 - think
81:08 - my wife's learning how to code
81:10 - when she finally gets to the point where
81:12 - she sets up her own code editor i think
81:14 - that would be really fun
81:16 - um the problem would be getting both of
81:18 - us able to code at the same time uh i
81:22 - don't know what i'd do with the kids
81:23 - but uh i that that could be really fun
81:32 - uh california boy asks how long have you
81:34 - been coding
81:35 - um i've been doing front end stuff for
81:37 - about five years now the first year of
81:40 - that was not really like coding it was
81:42 - just like basic
81:45 - basic css changes to wordpress sites and
81:48 - then gradually i got more into things
81:50 - and so about three years ago i started
81:53 - like very deliberately learning more
81:55 - about javascript and getting more into
81:57 - javascript and at the same time getting
81:59 - more in-depth into css as well
82:03 - and then for sure for the last two years
82:06 - uh maybe a little bit longer than two
82:07 - years
82:08 - i've been doing
82:11 - uh
82:12 - you know more with javascript
82:13 - development
82:14 - and um
82:17 - not reacted first i did a lot of single
82:20 - page apps with um with jo with jquery
82:24 - and then i've moved into react you know
82:27 - over the last year or so
82:32 - if you'd like to know more about my
82:33 - journey to becoming a um
82:36 - uh front end developer i go into more
82:39 - depth about like what i learned and when
82:41 - i learned it uh there's a video on my
82:45 - youtube channel which i think is linked
82:47 - in the description um i think it's
82:49 - called like how i became a front-end
82:51 - developer or something like that but you
82:53 - can check that out and um i think it's
82:55 - only about 10 minutes or so but i i
82:57 - talked more about
82:59 - um when i
83:01 - learned a code and how long it took
83:05 - michael says
83:06 - i keep asking my son why he watches game
83:08 - walkthroughs on youtube and now i
83:10 - figured it out
83:13 - well that that's cool
83:14 - um
83:16 - i never thought of this uh
83:18 - as comparable to a game walkthrough but
83:20 - i guess it's um
83:22 - i guess it is
83:24 - you know now that you say that
83:25 - that's kind of cool
83:29 - uh blake says hey guys what games do you
83:31 - play
83:32 - it's a cool question i don't think we've
83:33 - gotten this one before
83:35 - um
83:37 - right now
83:38 - i'm pretty much limited to mobile games
83:40 - because i just don't have the time with
83:43 - uh with four kids all eight years old
83:45 - and under
83:46 - uh to really like sit down
83:49 - at a you know computer or console to
83:51 - play things
83:53 - uh so mostly some some games on mobile
83:56 - um
83:58 - i like to play games from supercell
84:01 - um
84:03 - trying to think what i
84:05 - i have minecraft on on my phone i play
84:07 - that the kids like to
84:09 - you know to watch when i play that
84:11 - uh my son's been getting into minecraft
84:13 - on the pc
84:15 - uh but i can't i can't help him with it
84:17 - i get motion sick when he plays it
84:19 - and uh lately
84:21 - i've been playing super smash brothers
84:23 - with my son just a bit
84:25 - um
84:27 - and i have an old super nintendo that
84:30 - still works and i've been playing super
84:32 - mario rpg with my son as well
84:35 - i did get the the newest version of
84:38 - starcraft so they they remastered so
84:40 - it's like starcraft remastered i got
84:43 - that and i never played it
84:45 - um i just was so busy with my react nano
84:48 - degree course that i never played it i
84:50 - actually connected with one of my old
84:51 - friends from high school and um
84:54 - we were trying to get together to play
84:56 - online but
84:58 - it's never worked out
85:00 - maybe i have to make a better effort
85:02 - maybe over christmas break or something
85:06 - anyway i'm i'm kind of interested at
85:08 - what games you all play if anybody into
85:11 - into video games and
85:14 - if so would you like to play
85:26 - okay uh yes you asked what testing uh
85:30 - you did so the yarn test yeah so it's
85:32 - set up um let's go to the package json
85:34 - for a second
85:36 - so car should set it up that test runs
85:39 - our unit tests and our unit test is jest
85:44 - we're using jest for that and then we
85:46 - have a test.js file that you know
85:48 - configures all that and then also we're
85:50 - running the e2e so the e2e testing is uh
85:53 - we're using mocha
85:55 - and then if you want to so like all
85:57 - these are available in the github repo
86:00 - so you can check out runner.js and um
86:03 - spec js
86:05 - anything that's dot spec.js so
86:09 - if you want to look you know more into
86:10 - exactly what's going on check those
86:12 - files out
86:23 - let's see
86:34 - michael says i want a two shot of you
86:37 - and harshet
86:47 - all right i don't do i don't understand
86:49 - what you want let me know explain
86:51 - explain that please uh michael
86:55 - uh yes you asked um are are we using
86:58 - webpack what yeah so behind the scenes
87:00 - webpack is going here but since we use
87:02 - next to scaffold things we didn't
87:04 - configure webpack ourselves so there's a
87:07 - webpack config going on here
87:09 - that's just the default from next
87:13 - i believe you can do some custom
87:16 - configuration uh next now has a
87:19 - next.config file i don't think we're
87:22 - yeah we're not using it but if we wanted
87:24 - to do some more custom stuff uh then
87:26 - with our webpack build then we could do
87:28 - that but right now the default is
87:30 - working for us
87:38 - all right i see michael um notice the
87:40 - comma thing so thank you for noticing
87:42 - that sorry i didn't look over at the
87:44 - live chat and see michael also said i
87:46 - thought margins and paddings were
87:48 - completely different they are different
87:50 - let me take a second just to run through
87:52 - some margin and padding stuff
87:55 - um
87:57 - where are we at
87:59 - let's let's check this out well let's do
88:01 - this since we're just working on that so
88:02 - i'm gonna inspect this
88:04 - and
88:05 - yeah let's make sure that we're not
88:09 - let's see if i can increase
88:13 - whoa too big
88:17 - all right so let's try this
88:19 - so
88:20 - this i think is a really great
88:22 - demonstration right here in devtools of
88:24 - how margins and paddings work
88:26 - so
88:27 - we can look you know we'll take a look
88:29 - here
88:31 - actually would be better if we had
88:32 - something
88:33 - let's let's go up a bit
88:35 - so when you have something with a border
88:37 - it's it's better okay so right now
88:40 - this is our container div for our footer
88:42 - and you can see here's our border is
88:44 - this thin
88:46 - gold line
88:48 - so our margin of 30 pixels you see is is
88:51 - that orange area it's outside of the
88:55 - border
88:56 - right
88:58 - and then here's our border three pixels
89:00 - and then inside of the border is our
89:02 - padding right so
89:05 - padding
89:06 - is inside the container
89:09 - right so it's inside the container
89:11 - inside the border and it's between the
89:13 - content
89:15 - and the border
89:16 - margin
89:17 - is outside of the border so it's outside
89:20 - of the width of the
89:22 - container and it's between one container
89:25 - let's say another so
89:27 - your padding actually
89:31 - will
89:32 - increase the container so you see like
89:34 - the background color
89:36 - extends to the padding
89:39 - but margin is outside of that so your
89:41 - background color doesn't affect that
89:44 - okay so that's how
89:46 - margins and padding work so that's why
89:48 - sometimes we go with a margin
89:50 - sometimes we go with padding
89:53 - so
89:54 - it just kind of depends if if you're
89:56 - using a div that doesn't really have a
89:58 - background color
90:00 - you can kind of use margin and padding
90:02 - interchangeably
90:03 - the user won't even know
90:05 - because of you know if you have no
90:07 - background color you know in all your
90:09 - divs that you're trying to space out if
90:13 - you do have a color though then it
90:15 - becomes a lot more important as to
90:17 - whether you use padding or margins if
90:20 - you just use padding it's going to look
90:22 - like there's no space between anything
90:25 - because that background color is going
90:26 - to extend
90:29 - but if you just use margin
90:33 - then you may not get like
90:35 - you know like we have here where we have
90:37 - some space between the content and the
90:39 - background color
90:40 - right so
90:42 - it depends on what you're going for but
90:44 - they are definitely different
90:53 - uh blake said that teletype package
90:55 - could be a reason for switching over to
90:56 - adam for me actually uh i saw on twitter
90:59 - this morning
91:01 - that
91:02 - visual studio code has come out with
91:04 - something similar where you can i didn't
91:06 - check it out for sure i just know what i
91:08 - from what i read on twitter
91:10 - uh that you can
91:12 - collaboratively code on the same
91:16 - uh the same document the same um
91:19 - you know file
91:21 - that's what it seemed like like i said i
91:23 - didn't check it out yet
91:24 - i didn't try to use it yet but so
91:27 - potentially visual studio code can do
91:29 - the same thing now
91:35 - michael also asked what's the purpose of
91:37 - setting a margin
91:38 - um i kind of explained that but it
91:41 - basically like in this case we have a
91:43 - margin because
91:45 - i want there to be space between the
91:46 - footer and the content that's up here
91:49 - but i i don't want
91:52 - the color of the footer to be extended
91:54 - here so i want this this white space
91:56 - between
91:59 - so that's where you would set a margin
92:02 - at least in this case that's why we set
92:04 - the margin we could have different
92:05 - reasons for wanting to do a margin as
92:07 - opposed to padding
92:09 - blake asks if anybody has built a pc i
92:12 - built a pc
92:14 - um it's been a long time it's probably
92:16 - been over 10 years since i built a pc
92:20 - i think it's kind of fun but if you mess
92:22 - up
92:23 - like if there's sparks or something you
92:25 - could really mess up all your stuff so
92:28 - that part is not fun i've done that
92:30 - before and ruined things
92:32 - but if it all goes well then it is kind
92:34 - of it's really fun
92:36 - you know to build everything yourself
92:40 - definitely not as easy as just buying it
92:42 - or have a custom having one made but if
92:45 - you if you like that kind of thing then
92:47 - it it was fun
92:55 - uh john
92:57 - asks is box sizing border box on these
92:59 - elements actually i didn't check that's
93:01 - that's kind of important though i should
93:02 - have checked
93:04 - exciting
93:08 - do we not have box sizing on here
93:18 - it's not making a difference
93:24 - let's look at one of these
93:27 - interior ones yeah it is border box on
93:29 - these grid components
93:32 - box sizing border box yeah so the
93:33 - interior grid components are a border
93:36 - box uh you can see i wonder if i can
93:40 - see if we can get it to change
93:44 - yeah okay so
93:45 - look at this huge difference we have
93:47 - depending on on what we do with our um
93:52 - with our box sizing so
93:55 - in terms of our footer it's actually not
93:57 - causing that much of a difference right
93:59 - now but the rest of the elements on the
94:00 - page are like
94:02 - huge different
94:16 - okay blake sorry your uh your comment
94:18 - about uh with the link to the computer
94:22 - um parts
94:23 - it was hidden
94:25 - so i just unhid it so
94:28 - if anybody wants to check it out
94:30 - um at some point towards the bottom of
94:33 - the live chat uh blake pasted a link
94:36 - asking about
94:38 - what what you all think uh about
94:41 - the parts
94:42 - um that he's thinking of using uh to
94:44 - build a pc
94:49 - uh so nope says
94:52 - tested out firefox quantum and it's
94:54 - three times faster than google chrome
94:58 - that's really cool
95:01 - uh and actually has test results in a
95:04 - video uh on
95:06 - on their youtube channel so let's check
95:08 - that out uh if you're interested and
95:10 - thanks for the info
95:16 - oh no
95:17 - shoot
95:18 - i'm sorry so rook just
95:21 - reminded me
95:23 - that when you do get with the flag am it
95:26 - doesn't add a new file so
95:30 - my footer component did not get added
95:33 - i i do this frequently i should remember
95:38 - so let's do a git add
95:40 - now it's there
95:43 - so now i'm gonna do uh git commit m and
95:46 - let's say

96:08 - day
96:34 - all right now let's do
96:38 - okay push to github all right so now the
96:41 - footer component will be there really

97:00 - cool stuff i'm gonna have to check that
97:02 - out then
97:07 - uh
97:07 - let's see have you ever used bulma css
97:11 - uh if yes what do you think about it
97:13 - i have not used bulma so i i don't
97:16 - really have any opinion about bulma uh
97:18 - because i haven't done anything with it
97:20 - firsthand i i remember checking it out
97:23 - at one point but it's been so long ago i
97:24 - don't i don't really remember what i
97:26 - thought about it
97:32 - uh rick says do you have tests for
97:34 - javascript uh java on public
97:37 - uni github
97:39 - um
97:41 - i think all our tests should be on
97:45 - um on github let's see we have um
97:48 - yeah we should have all our testing
97:49 - stuff
97:51 - on github
98:00 - uh peter says hi jesse do you have any
98:03 - an opinion on linux and the fail of the
98:06 - city
98:07 - uh munich and germany with it regards
98:12 - no i i
98:13 - i actually did not hear anything about
98:15 - that so i'm
98:17 - i'm out
98:19 - i'm at a loss because i didn't hear
98:21 - anything about it so
98:22 - i guess i don't have an opinion
98:24 - in general my opinion on linux is i i
98:27 - really like it
98:28 - for running my servers on it seems to be
98:30 - easy to work with
98:33 - but since i don't really have any
98:35 - information about the particular
98:37 - incident you're talking about i'm sorry
98:39 - but i really can't give you
98:41 - a good answer
98:45 - new york says um i play racing games uh
98:48 - project cars and others with steering
98:50 - wheel and a bucket seat it's really
98:52 - enjoyable that sounds really fun
98:54 - actually that's that's cool
99:02 - let's see dave's talk about super mario
99:05 - bros
99:06 - yeah
99:08 - um
99:11 - let's see yeah actually so
99:14 - i'm gonna share
99:16 - a secret with you all
99:18 - and you cannot tell my eight-year-old or
99:20 - any of my kids not that any of you talk
99:22 - to them
99:23 - but i think
99:24 - i may get my kids
99:26 - the new nintendo the nintendo switch for
99:28 - christmas
99:29 - so
99:31 - i wasn't going to because it's expensive
99:35 - and i don't really have the money to
99:36 - spare right now
99:39 - but my son
99:41 - my oldest raphael who's eight he really
99:43 - wants it and he's been so good lately
99:46 - helping out with the baby and with his
99:48 - younger brother and he's been cleaning
99:50 - he wakes up in the morning before school
99:52 - now
99:53 - every day he's been doing this he wakes
99:55 - up he cleans the bathroom
99:58 - and then
99:59 - reads a book for 20 minutes takes care
100:01 - of his baby sister
100:03 - and his little brother
100:05 - reads his brother a book just been super
100:09 - super helpful so
100:11 - he's acting like that and now i i'm like
100:13 - man i gotta get him something nice so
100:15 - anyway
100:18 - i just wanted to share that with you all
100:19 - because i'm kind of excited about it and
100:21 - i i can't
100:23 - tell my kids be obviously it'd ruin the
100:25 - surprise
100:26 - but if anybody has a switch let me know
100:29 - what you think about it i'm going to end
100:31 - the stream in a minute or so so i may
100:33 - not catch it unless you put in a live
100:34 - chat really quickly
100:37 - but let me know what you think about it
100:38 - is it worth it is it fun
100:40 - what games do you like that you think
100:42 - would be appropriate for little kids
100:47 - are there any games that i should
100:48 - definitely stay away from because
100:49 - they're either not appropriate or
100:50 - they're just terrible games
100:52 - uh anyway let me know because i haven't
100:54 - even used it yet so
100:58 - i'm i i don't really know what's good
100:59 - and what's not good
101:04 - all right
101:06 - um
101:08 - alexandria says hello
101:10 - uh hey how's it going thanks for
101:12 - watching
101:15 - uh eric says inline styles and react yay
101:18 - or nay i don't have a problem with
101:20 - inline styles and react i use them
101:22 - occasionally
101:24 - the only thing is if you need just one
101:27 - element
101:28 - to have a certain style and you don't
101:30 - plan on reusing it anywhere then i don't
101:32 - really see the problem with inline
101:34 - styles at all
101:35 - if you find yourself using inline styles
101:38 - frequently then you probably would be
101:40 - better off using something else could be
101:42 - css and js it could be
101:45 - just a plain style sheet
101:47 - or any of the the many different ways to
101:49 - do css in react
102:00 - uh john says your son sounds like a
102:02 - great person
102:04 - yeah i don't know what happened uh just
102:06 - recently within the past couple weeks he
102:08 - started being super helpful i mean he's
102:10 - always been a pretty good boy but
102:12 - man he just like
102:14 - he just matured all of a sudden um
102:17 - it's kind of bittersweet though like
102:19 - he's not he's not like a little kid
102:21 - anymore he's
102:23 - you know now he's he's way more mature
102:25 - and being helpful so
102:26 - you know it's part of me misses him
102:29 - being little but now i'm just so proud
102:31 - of him now
102:33 - you know for being so helpful
102:35 - uh so anyway
102:37 - yeah so i want him to i want him to like
102:40 - show him how proud i am i can say it to
102:43 - him but
102:44 - i think he'll appreciate it much more if
102:46 - i get him something nice i remember how
102:48 - excited i was when i was about his age
102:50 - and my parents bought me a super
102:52 - nintendo
102:54 - i was just so excited
102:56 - so i think it'd be cool
102:58 - you know to see how excited he gets and
103:00 - his his little brother's uh his little
103:03 - brother and sisters will probably be
103:05 - super excited as well not the baby i
103:07 - mean
103:08 - she'll just chew on the controllers but
103:11 - the other ones will be excited
103:18 - let's see
103:19 - um david says that typography tag sounds
103:22 - like something really interesting
103:24 - yeah i haven't used it that much but it
103:26 - seems like it could be really versatile
103:28 - i'd like to learn more about it so
103:31 - as i use it i'm sure i'll pick up you
103:33 - know more of what it can do and get
103:35 - better with it
103:38 - rook says that's very nice of him those
103:39 - things don't just happen so you and your
103:41 - wife must be good at parenting
103:43 - i don't know about that i tried my best
103:47 - the way i figure you can't really know
103:48 - whether you've done a good job at
103:49 - parenting till till they grow up and you
103:52 - see what they came out as right you know
103:54 - at this point like they're still they're
103:56 - still baking right you don't know
103:58 - whether you've done a good job until
104:00 - until the cookies are done baking and
104:01 - you actually get to taste them right
104:03 - you know so
104:05 - if my kids grow up
104:07 - and
104:08 - have families and they end up being good
104:10 - parents then i'll know that
104:13 - i've been a good parent you know
104:15 - if they grow up and they they're good
104:17 - people then i'll know i've i've done a
104:19 - good job so
104:20 - until then i just
104:22 - trying to do my best
104:26 - david says no problemo we keep the
104:28 - secret thank you i appreciate that
104:31 - uh smilers ask how old are you i am 32
