00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with Jesse it's good to be back I know
00:09 - it's been a while since I streamed maybe
00:11 - glass Wednesday might have been the last
00:14 - stream so a lot has happened since then
00:20 - the first thing I like to do is just
00:22 - catch you up on any all the changes in
00:25 - the site and then we'll move into the
00:29 - routing so just to let you know I've
00:34 - currently broken a lot of stuff on the
00:37 - site I have not committed the broken
00:40 - stuff obviously but that's we're gonna
00:43 - jump right into me being in the middle
00:46 - of setting this up so I'm gonna explain
00:49 - how I got to this point but just wanted
00:53 - to give you all warning so since last
00:58 - week
00:59 - or at some point at the end of last week
01:01 - I gave another presentation
01:06 - about this site got great feedback from
01:09 - that as well everybody who was pretty
01:12 - happy not really a lot of big changes
01:15 - needed to happen so the site still
01:20 - pretty much looks the same if you really
01:22 - want to know about any little details
01:24 - that may have been updated you can
01:25 - always check out the github repo try to
01:28 - have descriptive commit messages when
01:32 - when I can but the updates have been a
01:37 - pretty pretty minimal at this point I've
01:40 - been doing a lot of stuff with just
01:41 - getting links to go where they're
01:45 - supposed to go and I've been working
01:47 - with the routing so not a lot that would
01:49 - actually change the look of the site but
01:53 - I like when I present to a different
01:55 - group I like to try to get the links
01:57 - that that group would be interested in
02:00 - working otherwise I went on I did an
02:07 - interview for a full-stack engineer
02:09 - position
02:11 - I actually made a video on just like a
02:18 - recap of my interview and some advice
02:20 - that I have so that's on my channel so
02:23 - links in the description if you want to
02:26 - check that out
02:28 - it's it's available I that just went
02:30 - live it took awhile to upload and
02:32 - process so it actually just went live a
02:34 - few minutes ago and I think I think
02:42 - that's it for my for my recap I thought
02:46 - there was gonna be more than that
02:51 - alright so let me switch over let me
02:56 - switch over to my other screen so you
02:58 - all can see what's going on also for
03:01 - everybody who's new here this stream is
03:05 - just me going through my daily job as a
03:07 - front-end developer I'm employed
03:09 - full-time at a small University and
03:13 - although today we're gonna be working on
03:15 - some you know back-end stuff
03:17 - occasionally we do occasionally we go
03:20 - full stack here but primarily front end
03:23 - so today the way this is gonna work is
03:27 - I'm I'm gonna set a timer for 25 minutes
03:31 - and we're gonna code for 25 minutes then
03:34 - I'm going to take five minutes I'm gonna
03:36 - look at the live chat answer any
03:37 - questions that you have and we'll
03:39 - probably repeat that twice then at the
03:42 - end I'll answer any questions that are
03:44 - left in the live chat so you have
03:45 - questions go ahead and put them in there
03:47 - and just kind of you know be patient
03:48 - until I can get to them also this is
03:53 - very interactive so if you see that I'm
03:55 - doing something and you have no idea
03:57 - what I'm doing
03:58 - ask a question or if you have a better
04:00 - idea put it in the the live chat I
04:04 - frequently end up changing my plans
04:07 - because someone in the live chat has
04:09 - something better so feel free to to join
04:13 - in and there are a lot of people in the
04:15 - live chat that are more experienced than
04:17 - I am so if you ask a question you may
04:21 - get an answer from one of them that
04:23 - that's you know pretty awesome alright
04:27 - so let me set the timer I'll put it on
04:31 - here on this screen so everyone can see
04:35 - when we go back here someone set that 25
04:37 - minute timer and I'm also going to set
04:40 - this n grukk server now I did let
04:44 - everyone know at the beginning so if you
04:46 - didn't catch it this the site is
04:48 - currently in a semi broken state because
04:52 - I'm messing with some ideas that I had
04:56 - for the router and that it has basically
05:01 - it worked to solve the problem that I
05:03 - was trying to solve but it caused a
05:04 - bunch of other problems while when I did
05:07 - it so now I'm at the point of like how
05:09 - do I make this work in a way that
05:11 - doesn't break other stuff so I'm gonna
05:15 - paste a URL right now onto the live chat
05:17 - and if you go to that URL you'll be able
05:21 - to see the site as I'm working on it and
05:25 - just in case you can't go to that you
05:27 - are right now I will show you what's
05:29 - going on with that I'd say here and this
05:38 - is this is what we have so you'll notice
05:43 - it's going to be hard to see but the URL
05:46 - right now is localhost / academics / ug
05:50 - / majors and we haven't had any URLs
05:55 - like that so far where we had like three
05:59 - three things at the end of the URL the
06:01 - most we've been able to deal with us -
06:03 - so that's why I had to mess with the
06:05 - router to try to get this to work
06:07 - but you can see since I did that our
06:10 - style sheets are coming through and our
06:12 - logos are coming through
06:14 - so basically everything we're trying to
06:15 - bring in from that static folder is not
06:18 - working so at least we're at a point
06:21 - where we know a lot about the problem
06:24 - right so that's a good good starting
06:25 - point so let me go over and show you in
06:28 - the code what's happening so we'll be
06:31 - focusing mostly on on this area here
06:35 - just to make some more space let's get
06:37 - rid of that sidebar we'll shrink this up
06:40 - as well and so this is what I've I've
06:45 - done I've taken this universal route and
06:48 - let me know if this is too small and you
06:50 - can't you can't see what's going on
06:53 - also hey everyone I forgot to say hi
06:56 - everybody's saying hi in the end the
06:57 - chat so so say hello then it just says
07:03 - sup Jesse Pinkman that's a reference to
07:07 - Breaking Bad if you've never seen the
07:09 - show that's why I was definitely not in
07:12 - the show but there is a character named
07:13 - Jesse so I took this Universal route
07:18 - which right now just grabs the type and
07:20 - the ID so in our example here you know
07:25 - the typing the ID would be academics and
07:27 - then ug but then what happens with this
07:29 - majors over here so what I did was I
07:32 - copied and pasted this entire thing and
07:34 - I put in type sub type and ID so now
07:39 - we're getting all three parts of that
07:41 - URL and then I went in and I change did
07:46 - I change
07:46 - I'll know what I changed it back I I did
07:49 - change some things in here and then I
07:50 - realized that I didn't have to change
07:53 - that much so I undid it so basically I
07:57 - copy and pasted that and then now what
07:59 - happens is when I go to see what page I
08:07 - was trying to get to
08:08 - oh that when they when it picks up that
08:13 - the type is academics it tries to send
08:19 - the data to the page component which is
08:24 - what we wanted and I'm still only
08:28 - sending the type in the ID so I just
08:30 - completely skip this sub type here which
08:32 - for this use case works going forward we
08:35 - may run into a situation where that no
08:37 - longer works and we'll have to figure
08:39 - out something better but for right now
08:41 - this works and it just goes through and
08:48 - it does exactly what this other one had
08:49 - done which is simply past the type and
08:53 - the ID into the component from the
08:57 - component we make a call using Apollo
09:02 - and graph QL to WordPress which we have
09:04 - the WP graph QL plug-in installed there
09:06 - and then WordPress sends the data back
09:11 - through the WP graph QL plug-in and then
09:13 - react can render the page and then that
09:18 - page gets sent to the browser to the
09:20 - users browser so all that's still
09:24 - working the problem is somewhere along
09:26 - the line and we can see it here in in
09:29 - the terminal hopefully it's still up
09:32 - here so what's happening is Wow okay
09:39 - there's so much stuff let's see if we
09:42 - can get it okay so we we have this is a
09:45 - good example so anytime we're getting a
09:48 - static file it reads it a static image
09:51 - in an ID because our our routes here in
09:56 - our file so we have the static file and
10:01 - then image everything within our static
10:02 - files is two levels deep so that gives
10:06 - us a URL with those three parts so I I
10:12 - guess what's happening is it's it's
10:16 - trying to take those and treat them as
10:22 - you know our usual route so I have an
10:26 - idea and let's see if we can if this
10:32 - will work if this idea works then this
10:36 - is gonna be like a very special stream
10:39 - that that my idea for the fix actually
10:42 - works so what I'm gonna try to do is
10:50 - just wrap everything in
10:57 - and if stamen so let's say if type so
11:07 - this will be rec params type equals
11:16 - static whoops is sorry is not equal and
11:33 - I'm silly because I already have that if
11:36 - statement right here alright so there we
11:40 - go so nikki is actually the one that
11:44 - created a lot of this so I've done very
11:47 - minimal editing to his original routing
11:51 - function and I forgot it in so he had
11:56 - already come across some of these issues
11:59 - before and put in this as statement so
12:04 - because there were some other things
12:06 - that are doing this so now we're just
12:06 - going to add that at if statement and
12:09 - say if the type is equals static we're
12:12 - not gonna go through this let's see if
12:14 - it doesn't mean let's see if it works
12:16 - oh you know what
12:22 - Nikki's apology apologizing for the
12:24 - spaghetti nassif the code don't even
12:25 - worry about it this is this code is
12:28 - awesome
12:29 - this definitely did what it was supposed
12:30 - to do and you know we've just come
12:33 - across some extra use cases that we
12:37 - didn't even realize at first so we're
12:41 - just gonna have to keep adding on to it
12:42 - I think to handle this
12:44 - AHA yes okay cool so that worked now I'm
12:50 - going to try to go to another page and
12:53 - see if it broke our other pages so first
12:58 - the home page excellent home page seems
13:00 - to be working and now let's go to I
13:03 - think this works yeah this works
13:07 - excellent
13:10 - excellent okay very cool all right cool
13:17 - so that part of the routing works now
13:22 - I'm sure this can be reflected somehow
13:24 - because we have a lot that we're just
13:29 - reproducing here so I don't know that
13:34 - I'm gonna be refactoring this right now
13:39 - during the stream but just just so you
13:43 - know I wouldn't I really would rather
13:46 - not leave it like this that adds quite a
13:49 - bit of length but for now this is
13:52 - working so before I had to do this what
13:56 - I was working on was trying to edit our
13:58 - object here that allows us to put in a
14:01 - lot of different routes and get some
14:05 - more of these pages working so if you
14:08 - weren't if you haven't joined us for
14:10 - some of the previous streams you might
14:11 - not know what we're trying to do here
14:13 - but we're taking an old site and we're
14:15 - completely redoing it so the entire back
14:18 - end the database content management
14:21 - system front end everything totally
14:24 - redone but what we need to do is try to
14:26 - keep the URLs the same because we've
14:30 - this site's been around for a long time
14:32 - it's built up a lot of links some you
14:36 - know external links pointing back to the
14:39 - site so we need to keep those intact and
14:45 - in fact one of the things that the the
14:48 - vice-president of admissions here at the
14:52 - University asked about and he was very
14:54 - positive about the site but one of the
14:57 - things he asked about was is this gonna
14:59 - break any of the links so he was very
15:03 - pleased to hear that we're doing
15:05 - everything we can to make sure it
15:06 - doesn't break the links but that's
15:09 - definitely a concern and that's a
15:11 - legitimate concern you know there's a
15:13 - lot of materials that have links to
15:15 - different parts of the site so emails
15:18 - that go out and printed brochures and
15:21 - things like that
15:22 - those
15:23 - and all be changes because we got a new
15:24 - site you know it can't be changed right
15:26 - away that costs a lot of money and takes
15:27 - time and you can't exactly recall what's
15:30 - already out there if it's already been
15:31 - given to people okay so let's go to the
15:40 - last thing I was working on and this was
15:43 - this this academics link so here's what
15:47 - I was let me just walk you through the
15:50 - last few steps I did so we're all on the
15:51 - same page and I just realized my Spotify
15:55 - has not been going for I think since I
15:58 - started my playlist just ended and all
16:03 - right let's put on something those
16:13 - alright I'm gonna let you decide what
16:15 - I'm gonna listen to so I have some old
16:17 - school 90s rap I have some like dubstep
16:21 - and I have some old school 90s rock
16:25 - music put in the live chat right now
16:28 - what you think I should listen to
16:30 - 90s rap 90s rock or dubstep and I'll
16:41 - check back in the live chat just a
16:42 - couple of seconds whoa looks like rock
16:51 - rock rock rock rock alright cool that
16:54 - this seems pretty all we do have a
16:57 - dubstep we have alright so we have some
17:00 - other things in there but it looks like
17:02 - 90s rock definitely one James s if 90s
17:06 - rap includes Tupac it does it most
17:08 - certainly includes Tupac but I think
17:12 - Rock one out so I'm starting it up now
17:16 - and looks like this is one of those
17:19 - playlists as Spotify just makes for you
17:21 - so it looks like I have Pearl Jam
17:24 - sublime REM Nirvana Red Hot Chili
17:28 - Peppers looks like a decent playlist so
17:30 - far cool
17:41 - all right so here's what I was doing I
17:47 - was tryin to get this route for the
17:51 - majors so it's been a long time since we
17:54 - even checked looked at the routing but
17:56 - basically to get to a page that displays
17:59 - information about a particular major for
18:05 - like a prospective student who wants to
18:07 - check out our what we offer here you
18:10 - just type in the URL so in this case
18:13 - would be localhost / and then like
18:15 - economics or accounting or whatever
18:17 - major we have which is a little bit
18:20 - weird that it's not we it would make
18:26 - more sense if it was like local o slash
18:29 - major slash whatever it is so it made it
18:33 - a little bit difficult so what needs to
18:35 - happen is we need to add routes for
18:37 - every single one of these so for some
18:42 - reason I could not get these routes to
18:43 - work and I worked on it for longer than
18:48 - I want to admit this morning and realize
18:51 - that I simply did not have any piece of
18:54 - content that had the slug of economics
18:57 - that I could grab from WordPress that
19:00 - was probably my problem all along and
19:02 - what I had which is basically this
19:05 - probably works right away it would have
19:09 - worked so anyway so that's what I was
19:15 - going through here but then I also have
19:17 - a page to display all the majors
19:23 - unfortunately when I brought the data
19:25 - over that was in an entirely different
19:26 - category so it's it's like under
19:34 - academics so that's what got me onto
19:39 - this academic section and
19:43 - eventually got me onto whatever that
19:46 - page was that we were just on so let me
19:48 - go back there we go
19:51 - academics undergraduate majors so now
19:55 - [Applause]
19:56 - that's why I even had to mess with this
19:59 - page I don't like this URL but for now
20:03 - like we have to keep it active so what I
20:07 - should be able to do now since I have
20:10 - well let's go to economics since I know
20:13 - that data is correct I should be able to
20:15 - good economics from here and the link
20:18 - was supposed to work
20:31 - cannot query field economics pages it
20:36 - shouldn't be clearing the field
20:37 - economics pages it should be majors
20:40 - unless it's case sensitive I don't know
20:44 - why it would be but I guess we could try
20:46 - it it might be case sensitive no it's
20:53 - not
21:10 - yep I think it's case-sensitive all
21:18 - right so we're gonna have to fix that
21:19 - you know in our routing so it seems like
21:24 - some of the links that we've just
21:26 - brought over from the old database have
21:29 - capital letters in them and all of our
21:35 - lengths here we're checking for
21:37 - lowercase so let's find I want to try to
21:48 - figure out where we can do this so we
21:51 - only have to do it once or maybe twice
21:56 - so let's take it out referenced
22:01 - [Music]
22:15 - maybe I'll just make another let's make
22:20 - another like a variable here I think
22:25 - that'll be the best
22:34 - oh you know what I can't I can't just
22:37 - set type here
22:55 - so what I wanted to do is said let type
22:59 - equals no type
23:20 - let me let me check the live chat
23:24 - quickly here
23:25 - let's see Nicki says at the end where
23:29 - the options object is construction
23:31 - constructed you can lowercase there
23:33 - thank you awesome
23:38 - I knew there had to be there had to be
23:40 - something type so we can go to lowercase
23:56 - to lowercase and I'll also need to do it
24:08 - down here since I now have double and
24:14 - there the ID
24:25 - you know what maybe we ought to do it
24:27 - for the idea as well I don't I haven't
24:35 - come across the case would that be an
24:37 - issue but doesn't take long to put in
24:41 - another to lower case alright so I'm
24:48 - gonna save that and then we're going to
24:51 - give it another try
25:08 - what is the difference here
25:18 - well this is silly
25:28 - and I shouldn't have to manually restart
25:30 - the server but maybe I'll try so let me
25:34 - hit save see Ikki says that an entire
25:43 - object can go and be inlined into
25:46 - rendering cache by the way that's for
25:49 - when it gets refactored okay cool Thank
25:51 - You Nikki all right
26:06 - so I'm just shutting down the server
26:07 - bringing it back up scene if we have
26:20 - now that's that's silly
26:41 - okay
26:44 - so I'm just I'm gonna do this just to
26:52 - test it out and make sure that I'm
26:55 - actually worrying about the right thing
26:58 - so I'm gonna make economics like this so
27:05 - we'll also have the uppercase version
27:08 - and it should work if that's really the
27:11 - issue okay yeah that is the issue so it
27:17 - seems like our to lowercase down there
27:20 - is too late
27:29 - okay I'm gonna check my timer all right
27:34 - about two minutes so about two minutes
27:35 - I'm gonna go back to the live chat so if
27:37 - you put any questions in there just hang
27:40 - on for a few more minutes and and I'll
27:42 - get to those okay so you know down here
27:48 - when I'm changing it to lowercase that's
27:51 - that's too early because it's trying to
27:57 - look things up in this translation
28:00 - object here and it's trying to look up
28:04 - economics with a capital e and it
28:09 - doesn't exist so we need to move that to
28:13 - lowercase up higher
28:27 - this seems like something this really
28:33 - seems like something that later on could
28:35 - be done at the level of nginx which
28:38 - we're going to use as our reverse proxy
28:40 - on the server I'm assuming that we could
28:43 - do something in nginx that would take
28:45 - everything in the URL and make it
28:47 - lowercase before it even gets to this
28:49 - point but I would like this to be
28:53 - functional for the demos coming up the
28:56 - more the site that is functional the
28:58 - better it will seem to the people I'm
29:01 - presenting it to so we can think of
29:07 - something it doesn't have to be a
29:08 - spectacular solution because ultimately
29:10 - it'll probably be temporary until we get
29:13 - this on a real server so that's what
29:16 - we'll do when I come back from this
29:18 - break so let me go back over here have
29:22 - about 15 seconds left so I'm just going
29:23 - to start this break right now and go
29:25 - over to the live chat and I'm gonna
29:30 - start way up at the top so if you asked
29:31 - the question just a minute or two ago I
29:33 - may not get to it in this five minutes
29:35 - but I'll do my best
29:44 - all right so have a question from I'm
29:47 - gonna have to use Google Translate on
29:49 - this because this is not in my normal
29:52 - alphabet so let me get Google Translate
29:54 - going on my other screen bow Don so bow
30:06 - Don asks can I incorporate view will
30:09 - react in one of my simple HTML pages
30:11 - with further upload to basic hosting
30:14 - without changing the web hosting plan I
30:19 - think you can I think there's a way to
30:22 - use react I I don't know very much at
30:24 - all about view so I really can't answer
30:27 - that but in terms of react I think
30:30 - there's a way that you can bring in
30:31 - react to your project just like with a
30:35 - script tag I've never done it though but
30:39 - I kind of remember when I was going
30:41 - through like the tutorial phase of react
30:44 - like the beginner tutorials that there
30:46 - was a way you could do it so if anybody
30:48 - has any experience with that
30:50 - please let bowdoin know and if I yeah I
30:57 - can't remember exactly I suppose the the
31:01 - official react documentation would
31:03 - probably have something in there about
31:05 - it so I would check their IB Shaykh says
31:14 - was that the one you're going for in the
31:15 - last coding session I assume you're
31:17 - talking about the interview thing yeah
31:19 - yeah so I think the last time that I
31:22 - talked to you all in a live livestream I
31:27 - was talking about going on that
31:29 - interview hmm sorry yeah so that was the
31:36 - that was the interview so I'm not gonna
31:41 - say a lot about it in the stream because
31:43 - I just did that video so if anybody I'm
31:48 - sure a lot of people in the stream don't
31:49 - care how the interview went so I'm gonna
31:51 - save
31:52 - and then if you do care check out the
31:54 - video and you can ask me any questions
31:55 - you want about it as well I'm you know
31:58 - I'll answer those michael says congrats
32:05 - on the interviews
32:06 - thanks thanks I appreciate it Alexi says
32:10 - Wow everything is looking really nice
32:11 - yeah the site is actually looking you
32:14 - know pretty nice up maybe I'll go
32:16 - through and just kind of scroll through
32:19 - some of the stuff that that's working I
32:22 - can't remember how much I had done the
32:24 - last time we strained I know I had done
32:26 - some things like before a presentation
32:31 - it gotta make it look nicer and I'm not
32:34 - sure if I showed you all that let's see
32:40 - buh-buh-buh John Shay I'm sorry if I'm
32:44 - mispronouncing your name let me know I'm
32:45 - supposed to pronounce it but it says why
32:47 - so much hard-coded stuff in in the
32:51 - router or lots hard-coded we're really
32:54 - it's because I have to keep these routes
32:56 - from the old site and so far this is the
33:00 - best way that that I've been able to
33:04 - come up with that we you know it's not
33:06 - just me we've other people who've been
33:08 - helping out with it especially Aniki but
33:12 - it's kind of the best way we've come up
33:13 - with to try to keep those routes so we
33:16 - can't really use the default routing
33:18 - system that comes with next jazz because
33:23 - we need to try to keep these routes
33:24 - working from the old site and if you're
33:31 - referring to some of the other interior
33:32 - pages why the charge code is stuff for
33:34 - right now things are hard-coded just
33:36 - because I needed to get them in for
33:38 - presentations but at some point there'll
33:40 - be very very little hard-coded and
33:42 - nearly all the data will be pulled from
33:44 - from elsewhere
33:50 - I John Hanson says have you heard of
33:58 - github probably marked down to JSX
34:08 - bring over the marked up data from
34:11 - WordPress you can override markup to a
34:14 - consistent style and I believe it won't
34:17 - be dangerously set innerhtml okay
34:21 - interesting all right well maybe want to
34:26 - check that out
34:27 - I'm not yeah right now I'm not worried
34:33 - about using dangerously dangerously set
34:36 - enter HTML because I'm pretty much aware
34:39 - of what's what's in the data but yeah at
34:44 - some point that might not be a bad idea
34:46 - to get away from it sorry I'm yawning so
34:54 - much
34:54 - I wasn't feeling well yesterday and I
34:57 - think I'm still not a hundred percent I
34:59 - just kind of sluggish and tired I didn't
35:01 - have any coffee this morning
35:02 - I I'm gonna mark down where I'm at in
35:11 - the live chat and the timers up so I'm
35:13 - gonna have I'm gonna go back to coding
35:14 - numb and then I'll come right back to
35:17 - where I left off and get through the
35:18 - rest of the questions but I'm gonna I'm
35:27 - gonna tell you just I'm gonna take a
35:29 - couple seconds here and tell you why I
35:30 - didn't get coffee this morning and I'm
35:33 - gonna sound like one of the laziest
35:34 - people I'm sure but in the morning
35:38 - usually I drop off my kids at school
35:40 - around like 8 a.m. so I did that this
35:44 - morning if I'm being honest though it
35:46 - was like 10 after a day there I was a
35:48 - little late this morning but so I
35:50 - dropped them off about 10 minutes after
35:52 - 8 a.m. and then I have to drive by a
35:55 - McDonald's to get to where I work and I
35:59 - downloaded this new McDonald's
36:02 - where you can just put your order in the
36:04 - app and then sit in the parking lot and
36:07 - somebody will bring it right out to you
36:09 - right which is which is really cool
36:12 - especially like the weather has been
36:14 - really cold lately so it's nice to not
36:16 - have to go walk through like a slushy
36:18 - icy parking lot you know in my dress
36:20 - shoes right uh-huh and I know I could
36:25 - just go through the drive-thru but this
36:28 - is even better I can just sit there
36:30 - right
36:30 - and I just saying this that sounds super
36:32 - lazy but anyway the app wasn't working
36:35 - today
36:36 - so instead of just going through the
36:38 - drive-thru like a normal person
36:39 - I thought well you know forget this I'm
36:42 - not going I can't use the app and just
36:45 - sit in my car
36:46 - I'm not going so I didn't so I didn't go
36:48 - I didn't get any coffee this morning
36:50 - it's like so I all day I've been wanting
36:55 - coffee and I just haven't had coffee
36:58 - because I'm I was too lazy to actually
37:01 - just sit in my car and drive through a
37:03 - drive-thru anyway I sound so terrible
37:12 - know that I said that out loud but if
37:17 - you haven't used that a bit if the app
37:19 - is actually pretty nice it takes all the
37:21 - pressure off like when you go through
37:22 - the drive-thru it's like you don't want
37:25 - to take too long for your order because
37:27 - people are waiting in the same way if
37:28 - you're in the store like you're in a
37:29 - line and but if you're just sitting in
37:31 - the parking lot on your app like you can
37:34 - take all the time in the world to figure
37:36 - out what you really want I check on my
37:38 - coupons against anyway enough about
37:44 - McDonald but the coffee's not too bad
37:51 - and it's pretty cheap so that's why I
37:53 - just stop there sometimes all right so
37:58 - we all right this is where we're at we
38:02 - need to fix this right so the idea is I
38:09 - just got a little noise in my headphone
38:12 - so we see so Steve I got a message from
38:16 - work okay I don't think so I think it
38:18 - was just Twitter okay
38:21 - Michael Chris's firstworldproblems yeah
38:23 - most definitely a first world problem I
38:25 - just
38:26 - the more I told you about that the more
38:28 - I just felt like dude like I'm so
38:31 - terrible that I'm even complaining about
38:33 - this this this this is not a real issue
38:44 - okay let me get rid of this thing on the
38:47 - side just give us some more space okay
38:51 - so we need to do then is add our to
38:54 - lower case higher up so I guess we can
39:00 - remove it from here so let me just kind
39:07 - of hit undo a bunch of times
39:12 - oops there we go
39:14 - all right so we're gonna get rid of our
39:16 - to lower case there Oh what's up all
39:21 - right is this
39:23 - it's Ju Li oh is it Julio or Julie oh
39:27 - let me know
39:27 - I want to pronounce it right server set
39:33 - k sensitive routing true or case
39:36 - sensitive routing false awesome
39:38 - okay so app dot set case sensitive
39:42 - routing false so cool
39:49 - so you're saying I can just do should I
39:58 - do
39:58 - yeah apt outset or server right now I
40:03 - think probably sir if that's for Express
40:06 - I'm calling Express to the server so
40:08 - let's try it this way first
40:11 - oops server dot sets okay whoops
40:29 - close
40:34 - see if that doesn't Rubin says looks
40:39 - like you have a scar on your face did
40:41 - you slay a dragon yeah I don't know if
40:44 - you could see of like right there is the
40:47 - scar no unfortunately I didn't do
40:50 - anything quite as cool was that although
40:53 - I mean if the dragon was pretty chill I
40:55 - don't know if I really want to slay it
40:57 - but my daughter Cordelia who's one
41:04 - thinks it's hilarious to just like slap
41:07 - you and scratch people right so that's
41:09 - that's what she did so she was just
41:16 - being so sweet sitting on my lap and all
41:19 - of a sudden she's just like BAM and and
41:22 - got me like all down here and then she
41:26 - just smiled laughed cuz I guess that
41:31 - makes sense to a one-year-old actually
41:35 - you know what here's what I'm thinking
41:38 - though the case-sensitive routing might
41:44 - not this still might not solve our if
41:47 - our issue like I mean assuming I did
41:50 - this right and didn't mess something up
41:51 - I still don't think it'll solve our
41:52 - issue because the problem isn't really
41:57 - with the router the problem is in how
41:58 - we're you know we're calling this this
42:01 - object and trying to look up and match
42:03 - things so what we really need to do is
42:05 - make sure that whatever gets passed into
42:07 - this object is lowercase so I don't know
42:11 - that this would would switch everything
42:13 - to lowercase or not if it is and I'm
42:16 - mistaken please let me know but
42:20 - otherwise I think we we ought to
42:24 - manually set yeah we need to manually
42:28 - set this
42:42 - all right I'm gonna try something that
42:44 - right now to me seems really silly like
42:47 - there's no way it would work but we'll
42:50 - see so let's go and type equals
43:19 - I'll try it out hahaha it did work Wow
43:28 - okay
43:30 - I can't sometimes stuff that's just like
43:34 - us there's no way this will work this
43:37 - just seems too easy here's the thing I
43:40 - want to make sure that this will still
43:46 - this will still work so I guess we're
43:49 - always gonna have a tight though aren't
43:50 - we yeah yeah we'll always have a tight
44:01 - should we do the same thing with ID I
44:05 - guess but maybe we should say let's
44:13 - let's make this conditional so
44:27 - whoops
44:38 - so if this exists then we're gonna make
44:42 - it this otherwise it's gonna be null and
44:48 - we'll do the same thing here okay does
45:04 - this make sense so I want to check first
45:12 - because I'm not sure if I would get an
45:16 - error on this but if I try to do to
45:17 - lowercase or something that doesn't
45:19 - exist I'm assuming that that's not then
45:23 - it's not even let me do that
45:27 - oops what's going on here
45:30 - it doesn't like it without it it needs a
45:33 - space there okay and then I can take
45:36 - this and copy it down into our other one
45:41 - down here and yeah so that would work
45:50 - all right Nikki says that that
45:52 - definitely will cause errors so it's
45:58 - good to have the check Michael said that
46:01 - that second one so I did catch that one
46:04 - in the second one so I had typed here
46:07 - and I shouldn't have
46:12 - all right Nikki says type is required so
46:15 - the check should pass always fast in
46:16 - that case that's what I thought
46:20 - that it wouldn't even come through here
46:22 - unless there was a type but I'll leave
46:26 - it in there now
46:28 - let's see I don't think you need that
46:31 - before
46:33 - equals
46:42 - what if it's so we have some some
46:45 - questions your says ah mrs. what if it's
46:47 - not a string it's I don't know I mean it
46:53 - should be a string so it's coming
46:55 - through the the URL I mean can we put
47:01 - anything in a URL I mean yeah
47:05 - technically I could just put numbers in
47:06 - but wouldn't it still come through as a
47:08 - string if it's in a URL I don't know I
47:13 - mean I was just assuming that anything
47:16 - coming through a URL would be a string
47:18 - and ducks she not sure I pronounced that
47:24 - let me know how you'd like it pronounced
47:27 - says I think you don't need that before
47:32 - equals and and null I'm not exactly sure
47:40 - what you're saying I don't know why I'm
47:44 - not I may be I'm just missing something
47:45 - so if you can clarify a little bit I'd
47:48 - appreciate it okay so I'm not sure about
47:58 - this whether or not this is doing
48:00 - anything for now should we I don't know
48:05 - if we should leave it or just get rid of
48:07 - it let me think if there's a case if all
48:14 - our routing is coming through yeah I
48:21 - think we'll probably be fine without it
48:26 - but we can put it back in if we we need
48:29 - to later on
48:35 - I wonder what the default is for Express
48:38 - if the default is is case sensitive or
48:42 - not case sensitive okay here we are and
48:50 - I would like to check out a page that
48:53 - uses both type and ID just to make sure
48:55 - we haven't broken anything so let's go
48:58 - to let's go to our student profile this
49:04 - should use as student profiles yep yep
49:09 - this still works okay cool
49:12 - all right since we have that I did say
49:14 - I'd scroll through this quickly so you
49:16 - all could see what we have so some
49:19 - changes that you may have seen depending
49:22 - on when the last stream you watched was
49:24 - we've gotten rid of all the social media
49:26 - icons up top and our our button up here
49:29 - it's a lot more clean we have you know
49:34 - just four menu items and our our search
49:38 - we've gone to a larger version of the
49:42 - logo that actually says the word
49:43 - Franciscan instead of just F us we still
49:47 - using the F us in this menu and on
49:50 - mobile
49:52 - we've changed up some of the names of
49:55 - the menu items so not not really a big
49:57 - deal but some of them are changed we've
50:00 - added in this xsf us was up here in the
50:03 - button and now it's here
50:05 - I think we've added a few other things
50:06 - and change the name of some things and
50:09 - then on here I did change the buttons so
50:14 - the buttons are now this is I I call
50:17 - them inverted buttons I'm not exactly
50:19 - sure where I got that from I'm I
50:22 - probably got it from somewhere I'm not
50:25 - claiming I made that term up but I've
50:28 - been using it for so long that I can't
50:30 - remember I got it from so anyway these
50:33 - are nice because they show more of the
50:34 - background which is kind of cool I think
50:39 - I'd still like to mess with the fonts
50:40 - and things probably needs a bigger font
50:43 - we've added in a little section to
50:46 - explain a bit
50:47 - more about the university about it in
50:50 - this kind of banner section as well and
50:54 - then I've just taken some of these these
50:57 - student profile cards and instead of
51:00 - using them just for student profiles
51:02 - we've used them for other types of
51:05 - information and that's about it and
51:08 - everything on mobile of course is still
51:11 - you know very much the same I think it
51:16 - actually looks nicer on a phone than on
51:18 - a desktop at this point which is I mean
51:21 - that's how we've been designing it
51:31 - okay let me see all right cool we've got
51:35 - about nine minutes left here all right
51:42 - so I was I believe I was showing yeah I
51:49 - was showing this page and then it didn't
51:51 - work because we had gone - yeah so I was
51:56 - showing the majors page and then
51:58 - clicking the links and majors and
52:01 - realized that that didn't work if the
52:04 - URL was capitalized so that's how we got
52:08 - to here but it was I'm actually really
52:10 - glad that we found that bug better to
52:12 - find it now than you know for someone
52:14 - else to find it in one of my
52:16 - presentations it would have been the end
52:21 - of the world you know I I definitely let
52:23 - people know it's still work in progress
52:24 - but still it's good to good to make the
52:30 - mistake live here in front of all of you
52:32 - on YouTube than to make the mistake in
52:34 - front of 12 people in a conference room
52:36 - on campus right I'm not sure that that's
52:43 - actually better one way or the other
52:52 - all right well actually I just got some
52:55 - feedback on this so let's go over this
52:57 - feedback while we work here and that way
53:00 - you all can contribute here let's see oh
53:08 - Michael did say even though you already
53:10 - did the interview I'm still going to
53:11 - work on the seating manager I've almost
53:13 - got the lube for requested seats for
53:15 - missing something okay cool
53:17 - Michael that's awesome actually for the
53:20 - react version of it I opened up a bunch
53:22 - of issues for stuff that I'd like to do
53:24 - that didn't have time to do so I don't
53:27 - know I keep going back and forth on
53:29 - whether I should keep working on it and
53:30 - I'm trying to think of some like useful
53:33 - thing like if it could fulfill a purpose
53:36 - that you know people need this then I
53:39 - think it'd be cool to you know finish it
53:42 - and they
53:44 - get available to people let's see
53:48 - Michael crew any of Michael was
53:50 - referring to the project that I had to
53:52 - turn in before my interview so if you
53:54 - want to check that out check out my my
53:56 - github account and it's a CD manager so
54:02 - I have nodes seating manager which is
54:03 - the command line version of it and then
54:05 - I react seating manager which is the web
54:07 - app version so you check those out and
54:11 - you know just do whatever you want with
54:14 - them
54:14 - they're definitely available for you to
54:17 - take the code or contribute or do
54:18 - whatever you want they're just kind of
54:20 - fun projects now so Michael says I
54:23 - didn't notice Evangelization I'm
54:24 - starting like faith and life better yeah
54:28 - this was I I usually don't have much of
54:31 - a say and in decisions like this my only
54:34 - thing is please keep them short because
54:36 - it's easier to work with shorter menu
54:38 - items so yeah I don't know if it's going
54:42 - to stay evangelization or not I kind of
54:44 - hope it isn't I did ask in in the
54:47 - meeting where this was decided I said
54:49 - you know is there another word that's
54:52 - shorter than this that we could use so
54:55 - we'll see how it goes yeah I'm with you
55:00 - I'm just not sure I have to be honest
55:05 - with you I think a lot of rethinking of
55:07 - what's actually in these menus needs to
55:11 - happen and I'm not really the person
55:13 - that's gonna be doing that it's gonna be
55:15 - my boss most likely so I kind of hope
55:20 - that happens but right now I I can't
55:24 - really do much about it
55:27 - and Nikki says maybe make the apply
55:30 - button not see-through and the other two
55:33 - inverted the button hierarchy primary
55:36 - versus secondary okay that's interesting
55:37 - so we could have apply so I would kind
55:41 - of look like this so apply would hmm I'm
55:48 - have to think about that and look at
55:50 - that what do you all think does it does
55:52 - it look like to at a place to have two
55:55 - different button styles right next
55:56 - each other or does that make sense and
55:59 - it definitely makes a ply stand out
56:01 - compared to the other ones yeah I'm not
56:08 - sure about it
56:09 - I definitely if the goal is to make
56:13 - apply stand out it definitely achieves
56:15 - that goal I'm just I don't know
56:24 - ix the more I look at it and more I kind
56:27 - of like it alright to think more about
56:33 - that okay cool well let's go all right
56:42 - at about four more minutes
56:47 - Sean saying maybe the logo colors for
56:50 - the button colors yeah we did have the
56:56 - buttons were colored they weren't the
56:58 - logo colors so they were are the this
57:01 - yellow color that's also in our color
57:03 - palette something we definitely could go
57:08 - with colors this is the kind of thing
57:12 - that I actually think this would be
57:14 - great for a be testing so once we do
57:17 - launch try out different variations of
57:21 - these buttons and see which one gets the
57:24 - best response like the most clicks I
57:29 - think yeah I think I'd like to do that
57:32 - so whatever whatever you end up going
57:34 - with for presentations and for launches
57:37 - I guess it won't matter that much
57:41 - because I think it would be worthwhile
57:43 - to test out different variations on our
57:46 - audience so it looks like don't make
57:52 - them transparent maybe a light green
57:54 - background
58:02 - yeah maybe we can mess with different
58:05 - different colors I've got to be careful
58:09 - here though because now that we're
58:12 - talking about different colors and
58:14 - transparencies and things I could spend
58:15 - a lot of time on this alright so I'm
58:19 - gonna make a decision here and just say
58:21 - I like these ideas but I think these are
58:24 - good ideas to implement after we launch
58:26 - and to test them so that way we'll have
58:31 - data if somebody comes back somebody I
58:34 - work with comes back and says what do
58:36 - you do to the buttons they look terrible
58:38 - I can at least say we're testing them
58:41 - and you know based on this data these
58:45 - buttons give us the best response I
58:48 - think that'll be that'll be easier in
58:52 - terms of like right now trying to
58:56 - explain why we do buttons one color the
58:59 - other is just going to be pretty much
59:01 - based on why I think this looks good and
59:03 - that's really kind of a hard argument to
59:05 - win against other people too but if we
59:08 - have data to back it up then you know
59:12 - you can't really argue against that if I
59:14 - say hey we're getting twice the amount
59:15 - of clicks on these buttons and you
59:18 - probably can even if someone thinks the
59:20 - buttons ugly if we're getting more
59:22 - clicks we get more clicks
59:30 - let's see Michael sit no don't do that
59:33 - looking on mobile change the border
59:35 - color and font colors let's see yeah
59:47 - actually let's check this out on mobile
59:48 - to mobile I think is where you really
59:55 - get the benefit of these buttons because
59:57 - the buttons cover up way more of the
60:00 - image on mobile so an inverted button
60:04 - actually is nicer or a you know button
60:14 - with a transparent background Roland
60:21 - says the one filled in is more readable
60:23 - yeah it definitely is more readable I am
60:25 - gonna increase the font size
60:27 - I wanted to increase the font size
60:29 - before but when I did it through these
60:31 - out of alignment and I had a hard time
60:35 - getting them aligned and so I just quit
60:38 - messing with it because I had to go to a
60:40 - presentation and I never got back to it
60:46 - let's see Sean says are the harmony says
60:52 - the font color blends in with the lab
60:56 - coat yeah you're right you're right it
60:58 - does blend in with the lab coat I did
61:00 - put you know the I kind of dark in this
61:04 - image a bit to try to you know combat
61:07 - that but you're right it's not it's not
61:11 - really I mean this image will likely not
61:15 - always be the image in the background so
61:17 - I shouldn't worry too much about it but
61:19 - yeah we do want people to be able to
61:22 - read it now on a phone it's it's harder
61:24 - to tell but like on a desktop you hover
61:28 - over it and then it's it's readable so
61:31 - it's not as much of an issue on a
61:33 - desktop but you don't have that same
61:36 - hover effect that wonderful I guess you
61:40 - can click but at that point it's like
61:42 - why would you click if you can't
61:47 - Sean says yeah true my final thought was
61:50 - maybe a white apply button in the bottom
61:53 - buttons green and then on hover invert
61:58 - well seems like we have way more options
62:02 - than I even thought of so yeah so I
62:06 - think I'm just gonna make sure that I
62:09 - save your comments and then that way I
62:12 - can refer back to them whenever we start
62:14 - doing our testing Michael says didn't we
62:22 - do this last week we were coming up with
62:24 - a bunch of redesign ideas an hour before
62:26 - presentation yep yeah that's true I
62:28 - remember that now yeah some of it was
62:33 - really helpful though and I did actually
62:35 - say in the meeting like oh yeah you know
62:38 - the people on YouTube told me to do this
62:42 - so I didn't take credit for it act my
62:47 - the head of my department actually
62:49 - really liked how clean this looked and I
62:53 - know it was you all that suggested
62:54 - taking out all of those social media
62:57 - icons so during the meeting I took them
63:03 - out during the meeting and and everybody
63:08 - really liked it okay so my timer is up
63:12 - and let me commit this good it's we're
63:23 - gonna add and then I'm gonna do a yarn
63:25 - CM right and that's gonna give us let's
63:29 - make this a bit bigger I don't know if
63:37 - Onis it bug fix let's do a new whoops
63:42 - did I yeah feature so let's say
63:54 - and roster three parameters
64:09 - alright that that's good no okay
64:14 - all right cool so I'm gonna make I want
64:17 - to make sure that that gets up so that
64:19 - you all can check out what we've just
64:20 - done and I've you know what I tell you
64:24 - the truth I see that Michael says it was
64:26 - a bug fix the lower case I didn't
64:28 - remember about the the lower case thing
64:30 - and so after I started typing the
64:32 - message so you are right that would have
64:34 - been better categorized as either just a
64:38 - completely a bug fix or part of it not
64:42 - in part of it but since it was all in
64:43 - the same file we couldn't really
64:47 - couldn't really check it out
64:49 - oh yeah nikki says and the static
64:53 - checking the route Wow
64:55 - it's I should have split everything that
64:59 - we did up into three commits because we
65:04 - did do three like very different things
65:06 - even though it was all based on routing
65:07 - so that would have made it much easier
65:11 - to categorize it and pick a good commit
65:15 - message so I'll have to remember to do
65:18 - that next time to maybe do smaller
65:22 - chunks it was alright so now everything
65:32 - is available in the repository the link
65:34 - is in the description so y'all can check
65:36 - that out if you want you can contribute
65:38 - if you want comment on what we did or
65:41 - you can take the code and use it in your
65:43 - own project if you like it's all you
65:47 - know an open source freely available to
65:49 - use let's say ok so now I'm gonna go
65:56 - through and answer all the remaining
65:57 - questions so if you have any questions
66:02 - please put them in the chat right now
66:06 - ok and I'm good to go I have in about 50
66:13 - minutes I have a meeting so I don't
66:16 - think there's enough questions that
66:17 - it'll take up 50 more minutes but just
66:19 - to let you all know
66:22 - definitely can't go longer than 15
66:24 - minutes all right so I'm going to scroll
66:28 - up a bit and keep going where we left
66:32 - off the last time Aleksey says this is
66:37 - still the Franciscan site looks almost
66:39 - done yeah it is still the Franciscan
66:42 - site and it looks pretty good at this
66:46 - point the thing that so the big things
66:49 - that aren't done right now are all the
66:52 - data is not migrated over and then even
66:55 - the stuff that is migrated over isn't
66:57 - linked up properly so that you can
66:59 - actually get to it from the website so
67:02 - I'm going to be focusing most of my time
67:04 - when I'm not streaming on moving data
67:07 - over and getting that router full of all
67:11 - the routes that we need also Harshit set
67:13 - up for us a file I are actually I really
67:19 - want to show this to you all and because
67:24 - it's it's kind of an important thing we
67:26 - have now that will let our client-side
67:29 - routing work where's my data is it in
67:34 - here I thought it was in there let me
67:41 - shut some of these menu
67:49 - all right here it is so we have this as
67:52 - URL now so not only do we have a link
67:56 - URL but we're also kind of manually
67:58 - passing in some of these things that go
68:01 - into the router so you could see like
68:03 - the the type so we have the page what is
68:08 - going to so basically like what template
68:12 - component do we want to render this data
68:14 - so in this case we want the page
68:16 - component the type meaning the like the
68:19 - graph QL type that we're requesting it's
68:23 - academics pages and then the ID is
68:27 - majors right so that's how we get client
68:31 - side routing to work otherwise I think
68:35 - we are still getting a page refresh when
68:38 - we were clicking that's not what we want
68:40 - so it we should be able to get server
68:44 - side rendered pages on the first load
68:46 - but then after that we shouldn't have
68:50 - another page refresh so in order to make
68:53 - that happen we now have this extra thing
68:57 - so in any of our links we need to add
69:01 - this so for now like we're pulling in
69:04 - data but if we were to manually add a
69:06 - link somewhere like hard-coded and you
69:08 - know we'd have to add this you know it's
69:12 - kind of extra information in so that was
69:18 - pretty good work I didn't even notice
69:21 - what was happening Harsha noticed I
69:22 - believe it was hard to notice it and
69:24 - came up with the fix for that so that
69:26 - was pretty awesome I assume Harshad is
69:28 - sleeping right now he should be is it's
69:32 - pretty late in in the Himalayas right
69:34 - now but anyway our should if you end up
69:39 - seeing this at some point thank you for
69:40 - that but as you can see I don't I don't
69:44 - have it all filled out so I'm gonna have
69:46 - to do that as well
69:59 - Rufus's URL end points aren't dynamic
70:07 - I'm not 100% sure would what you're
70:12 - asking so I let me answer what I think
70:14 - you're asking please let me know if it's
70:17 - not a good answer to your question but
70:20 - the URL endpoints so essentially some of
70:25 - them are and some of them aren't right
70:27 - so like these are going to have to be
70:32 - like there's going to be some like this
70:34 - where you know we're actually hard
70:37 - coding in these routes but then there's
70:39 - also going to be some more like let's
70:44 - see
70:45 - so like HR these human resource pages we
70:47 - have a bunch of pages that are going to
70:50 - be HR slash and then something and
70:53 - that's where the ID comes into play so
70:56 - as long as we have content that matches
71:00 - up with that ID in our WordPress
71:03 - database it can render out thousands of
71:06 - pages that would be like /hr slash you
71:10 - know whatever you want at the end so
71:12 - it's kind of a mix of some hard coded
71:15 - routes and some routes that are I've
71:19 - been calling them parameterised so
71:22 - that's that's kind of where we're at
71:24 - right now and I think I mentioned
71:26 - earlier the reason for that is because
71:29 - we have to keep URLs the same as we've
71:32 - had them before so if we were able to
71:35 - just build the site from scratch and
71:37 - have our own URL structure we wouldn't
71:39 - need all of this stuff unfortunately we
71:44 - we do have to keep the URL structure so
71:46 - we're gonna have kind of a big messy
71:48 - object here and a lot of stuff down here
71:51 - as well but the result is going to be
71:56 - well worth it right we don't want to
71:58 - lose out and have broken links and lose
72:00 - out on SEO and all that so I mean that
72:02 - takes years and years to build up so if
72:06 - we have to spend a few extra hours
72:07 - keeping that it's definitely worth it
72:28 - netskope says I know this is web
72:31 - development but do you have any ideas
72:32 - for a c-sharp project I could do I'm
72:35 - almost one semester ahead of my class
72:37 - and completed my extra projects I got to
72:42 - Wow
72:47 - I'd say truth I don't I don't know I
72:52 - don't have ideas for anything that would
72:53 - be like c-sharp but specifically good
72:56 - for c-sharp what do you all think what's
73:01 - a good c-sharp related project I mean I
73:09 - just kind of know there are always basic
73:10 - ones that people do like do a to-do list
73:15 - or a calculator or you know but those
73:19 - are all kind of boring and really basic
73:26 - rubenesque do you work out a lot I've
73:29 - been working out every day for like five
73:36 - or six weeks now I kind of lost count
73:39 - but pretty much every day one day I just
73:42 - kind of did some stretching because I
73:45 - didn't really have a lot of time but
73:47 - other than that I've been working out
73:48 - every day this morning I did not work
73:51 - out I was tired and my three all just
73:53 - wanted to cuddle so I just counted with
73:55 - him and but I do plan on working out
73:59 - when I get home
74:00 - to keep my street going oh I've been
74:03 - working out I make sure I do a little
74:05 - bit of cardio like at least a half an
74:07 - hour and then I have been doing some
74:10 - weights and things like that so this is
74:15 - all kind of new for me though before
74:17 - that it was very much like I worked out
74:21 - sporadically you know I'd do a couple
74:23 - days here and there and then I might go
74:25 - like two weeks without doing anything so
74:28 - I'm trying I'm trying really hard to do
74:31 - that mostly for my mental health really
74:34 - I mean it's nice to you know be a little
74:37 - bit stronger but
74:39 - it's it helps me with with depression to
74:45 - get that workout in so in addition to
74:47 - medication and counseling you know the
74:50 - workouts a big thing as well so I've
74:51 - been trying to keep my sleep schedule
74:53 - you know on target eating a little bit
74:56 - more regularly and better and then also
74:59 - with with the exercise so so far it's
75:03 - it's pretty good tell you truth lately
75:05 - I've it's like I don't know I haven't
75:09 - been I've been a little bit more down
75:11 - than usual lately I'm not sure why but
75:15 - for the most part over the last month or
75:18 - so I've felt really good
75:33 - okay we have some questions about there
75:36 - was a question a long time ago about
75:38 - react and putting it in a regular HTML
75:41 - project so we'll have some follow-up to
75:47 - that so where do you put react other
75:51 - than a script tag that is don't you just
75:54 - source react start Jess I think it
75:59 - depends it depends on how you're
76:07 - bringing in react so like on a project
76:09 - like this you know we are bringing in
76:12 - react here we're importing it right into
76:14 - the components but we've used create
76:16 - react app on a regular HTML project I
76:20 - suppose you could you could use the CDN
76:23 - like as was mentioned in the live chat
76:25 - as well so I suppose you would just use
76:30 - the script tag and link to the CDN that
76:33 - would be the easiest way to do it
76:39 - BBJ says hello all the way from Nepal
76:42 - hey how's it going thanks for watching
76:44 - Michael says by the way don't use that
76:46 - camera angle for the recap again the
76:49 - gray hairs in your beard really stand
76:51 - out yeah I am
76:54 - so he's referring to the video that I
76:56 - just put on my my chin my youtube
76:59 - channel that was the interview recap so
77:02 - yeah I that was the first time I tried
77:04 - to do a video with my phone so my phone
77:09 - camera is even the front-facing camera
77:12 - is much better resolution than the one
77:14 - on my iMac so I decided to just do that
77:16 - so I literally like just took my I've
77:18 - like a standing desk thing where my
77:20 - keyboard can go up so I put it up to
77:22 - like right here and I put my phone here
77:25 - and so that was the angle that I ended
77:29 - up getting so it wasn't ideal I just was
77:33 - like hey I would rather have like a
77:35 - 1080p quality video so I mean when I
77:39 - record with OBS I can scale up to 1080p
77:42 - but it doesn't look like 1080p because
77:44 - the camera
77:45 - can't capture that so anyway I will take
77:50 - that in consideration and yeah my beard
77:53 - is getting some gray headers in it I
77:57 - look a lot younger I think when I shaved
78:01 - my beard maybe I don't know maybe it
78:04 - does have something to do with gray
78:06 - hairs of course but yeah I'm like maybe
78:10 - a few gray hairs like down here in my
78:13 - beard my wife thinks it's funny
78:21 - suheib SS UHA Y B not sure how to
78:25 - pronounce that very sorry if I mess it
78:27 - up let me know how you'd like me to
78:29 - pronounce it but anyway they say I am 13
78:33 - and I'm watching these videos awesome
78:35 - that's that's really awesome if you're
78:38 - already taking you know coding that
78:40 - seriously that you're watching YouTube
78:42 - videos on it and especially these videos
78:45 - because I know they can my videos can
78:47 - drag on a bit and be a little bit
78:49 - difficult to watch you know but just
78:53 - they're long and sometimes it can be
78:55 - boring especially for working on stuff
78:57 - and it's just not working so anyway I
79:01 - think it's awesome that you're you know
79:04 - watching these videos and learning about
79:06 - coding so feel free to ask any questions
79:08 - I'll do my best to answer and keep at it
79:17 - Aniki says I know what I'm gonna be
79:19 - focused on while watching that video not
79:20 - yeah so everybody go and check out the
79:24 - gray hair in my beard and you know it'll
79:28 - get me more views so it's it's fine if I
79:30 - gotta use my gray beard here to get
79:32 - views then so be it
79:56 - I'm scrolling down and find more
79:58 - questions
80:04 - I'm scrolling through all the discussion
80:07 - about the button colors
80:17 - Kemal says which visual studio code
80:19 - theme are you using the theme is called
80:21 - SETI so SETI
80:24 - it's the SETI theme so it's the same
80:26 - theme that I used when when I'm coding
80:28 - an atom so I've been using this theme
80:31 - for years it was one of the first things
80:33 - I tried out and I just I really liked it
80:35 - and so I've never switched
80:49 - oh I see that Niki already gave the
80:51 - answer thanks for that Niki Jonah says
80:56 - you got any experience deploying to a
81:00 - sure it doesn't work for me with no js'
81:03 - apps I've never tried to deploy an
81:06 - odious app to Azure so I have deployed
81:11 - something no you know what I did deploy
81:14 - note but it was part of like a workshop
81:16 - so I took like steps that were already
81:22 - plotted out for me to do it so I've
81:25 - never tried on my own but I'm it's it's
81:28 - possible I know I'm you know we did it
81:30 - I like so my only experience with it was
81:35 - in a workshop so I'd have to go back and
81:38 - look through all the steps again and
81:40 - that may or may not work in every use
81:43 - case but um I mean it's possible sorry I
81:51 - don't have enough experience that I
81:52 - could give you more you know advice on
81:54 - on that
82:00 - kukuku so CH you KW you let me know if
82:06 - that's not how you pronounce it
82:08 - coo coo says do you know a school
82:11 - available for me I don't I don't know it
82:15 - depends it depends on where like where
82:17 - you're at how much you you have you know
82:22 - time and money you have to be able to
82:24 - dedicate to the school I mean there are
82:29 - some good online you know tutorials and
82:32 - programs available that you could do
82:34 - from anywhere as long as you have an
82:35 - internet connection you know well free
82:38 - code camp is free you could go through
82:40 - and do that it's not exactly a school
82:44 - Udacity has some grade like nano degree
82:46 - courses my wife is just finishing up
82:49 - with she actually just finished this
82:51 - weekend Flatiron school she really liked
82:55 - it so I guess those are theirs so my
82:59 - options if you're looking more like a
83:02 - normal school like a university or
83:04 - something like that then that that
83:07 - probably depends a lot more on on
83:09 - location and you know how much money you
83:12 - have and you know what you want to do
83:15 - with it as well
83:19 - [Music]
83:33 - I'm mission says how is the react part
83:36 - being sent and used I you know what I'm
83:43 - not sure what I was talking about when
83:44 - you asked that question so I'm mission
83:46 - if you could clarify a little bit I'd be
83:49 - happy to answer for you Joey says I have
83:57 - an idea for the hero do feel free to
83:59 - ignore if you at a time background color
84:03 - with background blood blend mode soft
84:06 - light let me see let me see if I could
84:16 - if I can try that out let me see where I
84:21 - have that hero components there's my
84:30 - components there we go
84:36 - all right let's see
84:47 - all right there we go so let's see
84:59 - you know what I may have to I don't know
85:05 - if this will work like this Joey so the
85:12 - dev tools much more readable
85:14 - okay so Joey just did it in dev tools
85:24 - so Joey was that for the entire curative
85:27 - or just for the buttons okay it works
85:30 - with the background image all right
85:33 - let's check this up then so yeah let me
85:39 - try it in dev tools as well that's that
85:41 - would be much easier
86:04 - that definitely is we're readable what
86:11 - do you all think about that
86:48 - Ali says 23 and watching from Turkey
86:53 - lots of thanks for free code camp are
86:55 - you welcome thanks thanks for saying it
86:58 - thanks for watching now michael says the
87:05 - stuff that doesn't work is the best part
87:07 - of your videos we all get to yell out
87:10 - solutions cool Michael says I'm out I
87:14 - got to figure out the loop issue and
87:15 - then work on my Simon game that I
87:16 - haven't worked on for three months to
87:18 - get the front end cert all right well
87:19 - good luck with that Michael John says
87:26 - are you ready to learn webassembly
87:29 - coming to a react environment before one
87:32 - can say
87:33 - supercalifragilisticexpialidocious webOS
87:36 - yeah I need to learn some webassembly
87:38 - stuff I keep hearing so much about it
87:40 - all the time all of us says I would give
87:47 - the apply button more top space yeah it
87:50 - does it could definitely use a little
87:52 - bit more space
87:53 - it doesn't look as bad on mobile though
87:57 - but you're right I think you definitely
88:00 - could use I think this whole thing could
88:03 - use some redoing of space and font sizes
88:07 - I think it's just a little out of
88:11 - balance
88:19 - Aniki says good idea in in that UI
88:23 - details Twitter thread as well d
88:26 - saturated photo plus bold color plus
88:28 - blend mode multiplied great for hero
88:30 - banners and creating high contrast for
88:32 - text Joey says the image gets slightly
88:36 - brighter if you take the gradient out -
88:38 - okay cool John says I don't think CSS
88:43 - image blend mode works across a lot of
88:45 - browsers at this point or we can check
88:47 - it out with with browser testing as well
88:49 - so I'm gonna keep this in mind actually
88:56 - I want to kind of let go yeah it's so
89:03 - much more like the text stands out so
89:07 - much yeah I'm gonna bring this up I'm
89:19 - gonna show this baby to my boss and see
89:25 - what he thinks this is the type of
89:27 - change that I can't just make I think
89:29 - I'm definitely gonna because enough
89:32 - people have seen this hero image and
89:35 - stuff and really liked it so I can't
89:37 - really just slide this change in here
89:40 - but I really like what it's done for the
89:44 - for the readability here
89:47 - and John yet we're gonna have to do some
89:50 - browser testing at some point maybe we
89:52 - could have like a nice fall back as well
89:55 - I'm mission says what I meant before
89:59 - about react was if all your react
90:00 - components were being sent in the public
90:05 - folder do I have this already I don't
90:17 - think I have this compiled or anything
90:19 - oh yeah I do have a look forward
90:30 - now I'm not sure I'm not sure what all
90:34 - ends up being in the public folder once
90:36 - we build it to be honest with you Joey
90:45 - says it could be done in or
90:47 - Photoshop to avoid compatibility issues
90:49 - yeah you're right
90:50 - I I'd rather not I'd rather do it in the
90:53 - code if possible because that way if if
90:56 - we have people who don't know how to use
90:58 - Photoshop or try to upload an image
91:02 - because eventually I think this image
91:04 - you'll be able to change the image just
91:06 - by uploading a new image somewhere so
91:09 - maybe WordPress maybe somewhere else and
91:10 - the image would change I think it'd be
91:14 - better if we kind of automatically get
91:16 - this this effect but love to test it out
91:22 - and yeah it's at first I need to see if
91:25 - this is acceptable and we can even do
91:27 - this and then we can worry about you
91:31 - know browser compatibility and things
91:32 - like that but I am I have a meeting in a
91:40 - like a half an hour and my boss will be
91:43 - in the meeting so maybe I'll just bring
91:46 - my laptop and show show him then all
91:51 - right well I've gotten to the bottom of
91:55 - the live chat so I think now's a great
91:58 - time there in the stream he gave me just
91:59 - a few minutes it's a relaxed before my
92:03 - meeting and get everything ready it was
92:05 - it was really cool talking with you all
92:08 - again I miss you oh I miss I miss
92:11 - streaming and we we actually worked out
92:15 - a lot of stuff so I'm really happy with
92:18 - what with what we've accomplished as far
92:22 - as getting the router working and got a
92:24 - lot of feedback on on this this area of
92:29 - the UI as well which is always welcome
92:32 - because this is the first thing people
92:33 - see you know this could determine
92:36 - whether or not they stay on the site
92:37 - whether they click they scroll down you
92:40 - know so
92:42 - I've said before I think spending the
92:44 - most time on this area and on this page
92:47 - is definitely worth it right so I I
92:54 - think I'll be back tomorrow I haven't
92:57 - checked my calendar for tomorrow yet so
92:59 - I figure though I should be able to get
93:01 - in at least an hour of streaming I'll
93:03 - let everybody know on if you follow me
93:06 - on Twitter on Instagram or if you follow
93:09 - this YouTube channel you should get
93:11 - updates at some point I've been updating
93:13 - on all those places the notification on
93:16 - YouTube will come up automatically if
93:18 - you turn on notifications for this
93:20 - channel so that you'll know whenever I'm
93:23 - going to stream and thank you so much
93:26 - for watching and have a great day
