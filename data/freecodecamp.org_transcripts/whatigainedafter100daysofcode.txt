00:00 - hi good morning my name is illustria but
00:03 - i know it can be a little bit difficult
00:05 - to be pronunciated so you can call me
00:06 - ellie
00:08 - and i'm a front-end developer and today
00:10 - i'm going to tell you my story of what
00:12 - again after 100 days of code
00:16 - so uh does anyone know the challenge 100
00:19 - days of code
00:21 - all right great
00:24 - almost two years ago i was doing my
00:25 - internship in amsterdam
00:27 - and i knew that after my internship i
00:30 - should go back to my country which is
00:32 - greece and find my first developer job
00:35 - but i didn't have a lot of skills and my
00:38 - portfolio wasn't that good
00:41 - so i thought that i should do something
00:44 - to develop myself and develop my skills
00:47 - every morning i read
00:49 - in the medium platform a lot of articles
00:51 - i like doing that and one day i read an
00:54 - article called 100 days of code the
00:56 - challenge and it was written by the
00:58 - creator of a challenge called 100 days
01:00 - of code and he was explaining the rules
01:03 - and the benefits of taking part in it
01:06 - uh the rules
01:10 - like the rules where to code for at
01:12 - least one hour every day and should be
01:14 - outside from your nine-to-five developer
01:16 - job and then post that code on github
01:20 - upload it there and share it on twitter
01:23 - and also follow people there give them
01:25 - feedback
01:26 - and
01:27 - be happy with what you're doing
01:30 - so my next step was
01:32 - challenge accepted let's do this
01:35 - and i started coding every day for at
01:38 - least one hour i was trying to find
01:40 - things that i like maybe it was
01:42 - something from my work that i wanted to
01:44 - get better or something completely
01:46 - different like a new skill a new
01:48 - language and then i would upload the
01:50 - codes on github
01:52 - every time every day and share it on uh
01:56 - twitter and also try to give my feedback
01:58 - there
02:00 - the first couple of days i was quite shy
02:03 - using twitter and i didn't really know
02:05 - how to do that
02:06 - so i was just like like like every post
02:09 - but then as i was uh started connecting
02:12 - with people and started leaving comments
02:14 - and people gave me feedback and i
02:17 - thought that i'm doing something nice
02:19 - and i'm getting better and i should
02:21 - continue doing that so this gave me
02:23 - motive
02:24 - a lot of people
02:26 - either on emails or friends that i was
02:29 - telling them about that i'm doing this
02:31 - challenge were asking me and how do you
02:33 - find where to code or i want to start
02:35 - also coding but i don't know how can i
02:37 - do that
02:39 - for me
02:40 - there are a lot of great sources and
02:43 - they're usually free which is nice and
02:45 - you can learn a lot of stuff there
02:48 - there are online educational platforms
02:50 - like free code camp that i used a lot
02:52 - and
02:53 - udemy udacity coursera future learn and
02:56 - a lot a lot more
02:58 - of course there is youtube that you can
03:00 - find courses for all levels and this is
03:02 - always free and um online communities
03:05 - and here i'm referring to stack overflow
03:07 - like we wouldn't be there if it was on
03:09 - the stack overflow
03:11 - and there are other coding challenges i
03:13 - did the 100 days of code but then of
03:15 - course there are
03:17 - 30 days 30 sides our daily css images
03:21 - and all these challenges gives you an
03:23 - email and in this mail you can find a
03:25 - link or a youtube video or something and
03:28 - you can follow it and also get
03:30 - better you can read books and magazines
03:34 - like one of my favorite favorite books
03:37 - if you're the javascript developer is
03:39 - the a lot in javascript i think it's
03:41 - also well known and those first
03:43 - inspiration i can read blogs browse
03:46 - forums follow your favorite publications
03:48 - on medium or on twitter and
03:51 - read read read of course go to meetups
03:54 - and attending conferences
03:57 - right
04:00 - this is a
04:01 - full
04:02 - mix of everything
04:04 - and so now what did i learn and what did
04:06 - i wanted to learn
04:08 - um the first thing and the most basic
04:10 - thing if you want to be a front-end
04:12 - developer which was my goal
04:14 - is to
04:15 - know the basics like html css and
04:18 - javascript
04:20 - but it's not only this then you have to
04:22 - develop so it's like html5 css3 5
04:25 - bootstrap flexbox and all these kind of
04:29 - beautiful things
04:30 - and uh then i should start using the
04:33 - javascript console more i mean i wanted
04:36 - to do that for a long time but i didn't
04:38 - know how to do it and i saw other
04:40 - developers that were doing it but i was
04:43 - like okay i see all these little pretty
04:46 - tubs there but i don't know what exactly
04:47 - they are doing
04:48 - but it's okay
04:50 - we can do it
04:52 - and then the last thing that i wanted to
04:54 - learn was maybe angularjs or another
04:56 - framework i wasn't sure about it but i
04:59 - learned angularjs and the data
05:01 - visualization library and i learned the
05:03 - d3gs
05:06 - now what did i build one of the first
05:08 - things that i built was
05:10 - i have a search animation here all these
05:13 - images that you can see are made with
05:16 - only css or sscss and some html some of
05:20 - them are very very simple and it can be
05:23 - done in less than an hour but some of
05:24 - them are more complicated so this was my
05:27 - first step learn very good html and css
05:31 - and i built 50 of these images
05:36 - the next thing was javascript
05:38 - and i started building some parts of
05:40 - websites and using my first api calls
05:43 - some of them were very simple and not
05:45 - very good not very stylish
05:47 - but i tried
05:50 - then i started getting into more like
05:52 - games and quizzes my first quizzes were
05:55 - also very very simple only questions and
05:57 - then some answers and the scores
06:00 - but um as i was doing the free code camp
06:03 - uh there were some challenges there and
06:05 - one of them was the simon game and the
06:07 - tic-tac-toe game and i started learning
06:10 - more and more how to code better in
06:12 - javascript and build these games
06:17 - then my next goal was to learn angularjs
06:20 - and once again i started building some
06:22 - small parts of websites
06:25 - and they were very simple but for me it
06:27 - was a big step because it was the first
06:29 - time that i was building something and
06:32 - people liked it i saw it in twitter
06:35 - right and
06:36 - then i thought that i wanted to do also
06:39 - something extra and that was learning
06:42 - data visualization and i chose the
06:44 - library d3gs and this is an example of
06:47 - it
06:49 - and last but not least i built this
06:52 - almost two months ago
06:53 - and it's a screenshot for a game the
06:55 - game is called game of life
06:58 - and uh this game took me
07:01 - one or two days only to understand the
07:03 - rules of how to play it
07:05 - so it was a big procedure for me to
07:08 - learn firstly how to plate it and then
07:10 - how to code it but in the end i learned
07:12 - a lot of things and i think it's pretty
07:14 - cool
07:15 - does anyone know the game
07:17 - game of life
07:19 - it's very complicated
07:22 - very complicated
07:25 - okay so
07:27 - i didn't build all these things in 100
07:30 - days of code like as the challenge said
07:33 - i continue building things after this
07:35 - time
07:36 - so a lot of people ask me
07:39 - what is my motivation and
07:41 - what inspires me and for me it's always
07:45 - an urge to get better and follow my
07:47 - dreams and my dreams is getting better
07:50 - and have a good job and also help others
07:56 - so there is this quote from tim ferriss
07:59 - maybe some of you can find it a little
08:01 - bit arrogant but it says you are the
08:03 - average of the five people you're most
08:05 - associated with
08:07 - and i totally believe this like
08:09 - here today everyone is here because i
08:12 - guess he wants or she wants to get
08:14 - better and learn something more and
08:16 - learn something cool and how can we do
08:19 - that we can socialize and connect with
08:21 - others so i think these quotes really
08:23 - represent what we are doing now and
08:25 - maybe our dreams and our goals
08:29 - and another quote
08:31 - um i would also like to encourage you to
08:34 - take part in this challenge or learn
08:36 - something more or develop a skill
08:38 - but it's like i'm not telling you it's
08:40 - going to be easy but i'm telling you
08:42 - it's going to be worth it because after
08:44 - completing uh this challenge and after
08:46 - learning all these skills
08:48 - i also get socialized a lot more again
08:51 - followers on twitter i found a nice job
08:54 - and it wasn't very difficult to find a
08:56 - job although
08:57 - when i started i was very afraid that i
09:00 - wouldn't be able to do anything
09:04 - so
09:06 - so here i'm going to present some tips
09:08 - and tricks that
09:10 - i believe will help you also to do
09:13 - something great
09:14 - and the first of them is setting your
09:17 - goals and priorities right we can do
09:19 - anything we don't have a specific clear
09:23 - goal in our mind so set your goal and
09:25 - priorities and bits straight with them
09:29 - another important thing that i've also
09:32 - talked about is finding your motivation
09:34 - the motivation can be different for
09:36 - everyone maybe for some of them is just
09:38 - through learning skill to impress their
09:40 - boss or
09:41 - take a promotion or somebody else wants
09:44 - to do a freelancing job to help their
09:46 - family financially and also want to do
09:49 - to have a new skill
09:52 - but motivation
09:54 - as this image shows there can only get
09:56 - you so far when you want to be at the
09:59 - top so it's like when you begin to do
10:02 - something you are yes i'm going to do
10:03 - that and i'm going to kill that and
10:05 - everything will be better but after
10:07 - times passes like your energy goes down
10:10 - down down so what you have to do
10:13 - is be determined you have to be
10:15 - determined and you have to say yes i'm
10:17 - going to do it i'm going to build it i'm
10:19 - going to to make a new skill or
10:21 - something
10:22 - yes and i really like this image here
10:25 - and i'm going to read it it says like
10:28 - how do you program so well practice it
10:30 - must be an ended gift a gift from god
10:32 - its practice a letter understand how
10:35 - people are so talented a mystery at its
10:37 - practice
10:38 - so yes it's practice we are not gifted
10:41 - or at least i'm not gifted
10:44 - but i have practiced a lot
10:47 - and then there is another problem and i
10:50 - think that pretty much most of us have
10:52 - it and it's time management
10:55 - um we don't have the time to build
10:57 - something to learn something or do
10:59 - something cool that you like
11:01 - and for me what helped me is first thing
11:04 - put your phone away set it to silence
11:06 - set it to airplane mode just don't be in
11:09 - the same room with it all right then if
11:11 - you think like one hour is a lot you can
11:14 - use the pomodoro claw the pomodoro
11:16 - technique sorry which basically says
11:18 - that um set a timer for 20 to 25 minutes
11:22 - then take a break for five minutes and
11:24 - continue this for three times and then
11:26 - voila you have your one hour
11:30 - so
11:31 - the last thing is i keep it to do list
11:34 - or a calendar i've read of this thing
11:36 - like a lot of times but i i didn't use
11:40 - to do that
11:41 - in the end i started doing uh starting
11:43 - keeping a calder or to-do list it
11:45 - doesn't have to be something complicated
11:47 - for me the simple the better just write
11:50 - something down and try to stick to it
11:52 - and in the end of the day you can review
11:54 - it and see all the great things that you
11:55 - have accomplished
12:00 - so by doing this challenge i gained a
12:03 - lot of things like i learned to be more
12:05 - optimistic and grateful and connect with
12:07 - people
12:08 - i also did a lot of other challenges
12:11 - like i mentioned 30 days 30 sides
12:14 - and
12:15 - i left to believe in myself
12:18 - i learned no doubt myself so much
12:20 - and of course i met a lot of people with
12:22 - different backgrounds and different
12:24 - aspirations most of them admitted them
12:27 - via twitter or me emails or maybe skype
12:30 - but it was great hearing their stories
12:32 - and what they also want to accomplish
12:36 - now would i recommend
12:38 - signing up for a challenge like this and
12:40 - the answer of course for me is yes if
12:42 - you want to get better improve and learn
12:45 - something do something for yourself then
12:47 - yes you should totally do this
12:50 - uh some against small cheeks and tips
12:54 - like
12:55 - track your progress daily or weekly
12:57 - goals don't get easily disappointed
13:00 - always encourage other and be kind to
13:02 - others and stick your to your goals
13:06 - so thank you very much
13:08 - that was my presentation
