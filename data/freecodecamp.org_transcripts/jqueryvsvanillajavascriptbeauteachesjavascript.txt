00:00 - When jQuery first came out, it made a bunch of things a lot easier than just using normal Javascript.
00:06 - However vanilla Javascript has caught up a little bit with jQuery and a lot of things that jQuery made a lot easier,
00:14 - vanilla Javascript can do it just as easily.
00:18 - Let's go through some of the new vanilla Javascript alternatives to jQuery methods.
00:22 - Well here's how you select an element.
00:24 - So here's a jQuery way of selecting an element, and then here's the vanilla Javascript way of selecting an element.
00:30 - It's only a few more characters to do the Javascript way.
00:33 - Now let's see how to remove an element.
00:36 - So that's how you would remove an element in jQuery.
00:39 - And then let's see how you would remove an element in Javascript. As you can see it's exactly the same.
00:46 - Now let's see how to prepend an element.
00:48 - Let's change this to prepend.
00:51 - Now in the parentheses, we have to put what other element we're going to prepend.
00:56 - And then the vanilla Javascript way.
01:00 - And again it's exactly the same. If you want an insert an element before another element, you can use before().
01:08 - And this time, I'm just gonna copy and paste
01:11 - because it's exactly the same. If you want to replace an element with another element, replaceWith().
01:20 - And again, it's exactly the same with vanilla Javascript.
01:23 - If you want to find the closest ancestor that matches a given selector,
01:28 - you just use closest() and then you pass in the selector div.
01:35 - And again we're just gonna copy and paste because this is another thing that's been implemented in normal Javascript.
01:42 - Now we're gonna go over a few things that are a little longer in vanilla Javascript so jQuery does make them easier,
01:48 - but they're still pretty easy in Javascript. The first one is fadeIn().
01:54 - So here's how you're gonna fade in an element in jQuery.
01:57 - In vanilla Javascript first you're going to have to use some CSS. So you're gonna have to put in the initial CSS here.
02:04 - You're gonna put display: none, opacity: zero, transition: 0.8 seconds
02:08 - So it's not going to be display at the beginning and now you're just going to put in this other code:
02:14 - Elem dot style dot display equals block, so you're going to set the display to block, and then you're just gonna do requestAnimationFrame()
02:19 - and you're gonna set the opacity to 1.
02:23 - So it's gonna start at 0 and go up to 1 in 0.8 seconds. And yet for the fadeIn you still
02:29 - have to select the item. I didn't mean to delete that. Another thing that jQuery has is .animate().
02:35 - So the .animate method would look like this to animate an object:
02:38 - So you're just gonna pass in all the CSS properties you want to animate and the time 1500 milliseconds.
02:46 - Now Javascript now has the web animations API.
02:49 - That makes animation pretty easy, and it gives you a lot more power than the .animate method from jQuery.
02:55 - So here's how you're gonna animate in vanilla Javascript.
02:58 - Again it's dot animate
02:59 - and you just pass in the initial state of the element, the CSS, and
03:04 - then the state of the CSS after it's been animated and then the length of the animation
03:10 - 1000 milliseconds.
03:11 - So another key selling point of jQuery in the past has been AJAX.
03:15 - jQuery made it a lot easier to do AJAX instead of using the XML
03:20 - HTTP request. So here's one of the ways to do AJAX in jQuery.
03:25 - So you're gonna pass in the URL, and then if it's success you're gonna do something with this data.
03:32 - Javascript now has the Fetch API.
03:34 - With the Fetch API, it's almost as simple.
03:37 - See? You're gonna pass in the URL, and then you're gonna put what's going to happen with the data.
03:44 - Now here's the almost catch to doing things with vanilla Javascript:
03:49 - Some of these things are still not supported by Internet Explorer and Edge.
03:54 - However, I say almost catch because pretty much everything can be polyfilled and
03:59 - polyfilling may be easier than you think. There's a website called polyfill.io.
04:05 - If you just put in this one line of code at the top of your website,
04:10 - everything will be polyfilled. It will automatically check which browser the the user of the website has and
04:17 - only bring in the code that's needed for that specific browser.
04:21 - So only brings in the polyfill code that's absolutely necessary to bring that browser up to date.
04:27 - So you may be thinking, "If Javascript has all these things, do I still need to learn jQuery?"
04:33 - Well, it's still good to become familiar with it because jQuery is still used in a lot of websites.
04:38 - So you're probably gonna come in contact with it eventually.
04:42 - You should just know that for a lot of things, you don't even really need jQuery for.
04:46 - This whole video was based on an article by Ollie Williams
04:50 - called "(Now More Than Ever) You Might Not Need jQuery" on css-tricks.com.
04:55 - I highly recommend checking out the original article. I have the link in the description.
