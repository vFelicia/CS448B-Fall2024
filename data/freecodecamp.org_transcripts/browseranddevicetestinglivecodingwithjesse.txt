00:07 - hey everybody its Jesse and today I'm
00:12 - sick so I apologize if I'm a little bit
00:17 - harder to hear today or a little out of
00:18 - it but I don't have time to be sick
00:21 - because we got to launch this site so
00:24 - the site's going to launch tomorrow we
00:27 - need to do some testing I'm going to
00:31 - test using browser stack and also with
00:36 - the device so I have the pixel XL and
00:41 - I'm just I have it connected directly to
00:45 - my iMac and we're going to use dev tools
00:48 - and test on the device I did want to
00:52 - show you how to test simulate an iPhone
00:56 - with Xcode but I tried to start it two
01:00 - minutes ago and it wanted me to download
01:01 - extra stuff for it to work that's not
01:04 - going to happen so sorry about that
01:06 - ideally for it it's better if you
01:10 - actually have a fun and iPhone to test
01:12 - it on if you can get a hold of one I
01:14 - found the simulator isn't always
01:16 - accurate you get the Xcode simulator so
01:21 - some other people that I work with have
01:24 - fun so I'm just going to borrow one of
01:25 - their funds later on and test because
01:28 - based on the analytics for some of our
01:30 - other sites a lot of users are going to
01:35 - be on an iPhone so the browsers that we
01:39 - need to worry about most based on the
01:41 - analytics are chrome which we should be
01:45 - fine in chrome we've been developing it
01:47 - in from the whole way so I'm not as
01:49 - worried about that and Safari
01:53 - specifically Mobile Safari which I
01:56 - always have problems with on my list of
01:59 - least favorite browsers Mobile Safari
02:01 - might be worse than edited Explorer for
02:03 - me so I mean at least worse than
02:08 - Internet Explorer 11 we will try out
02:11 - internet explorer 11
02:13 - I don't think I'm going to bother with
02:15 - edge because our analytics show it's
02:19 - such a small percentage of our users are
02:21 - using edge it's probably not a good use
02:25 - of our time at this point if I had more
02:28 - time I'd maybe give it a try so let's
02:35 - get started with some testing oh hey
02:37 - everybody I just looked at the live chat
02:39 - some people saying hello I've a question
02:44 - for it for all of you if I'm having an
02:50 - issue with one of my other site so I'm
02:52 - going to throw this out there and y'all
02:53 - can think about it and comment or direct
02:55 - message me or something if you have a
02:57 - good answer I'm using I have an app
03:01 - where users have to log in I'm using
03:04 - auth0 for authentication it's one of the
03:08 - magic link logins so they get an email
03:10 - with a link when they click the link
03:12 - they're logged in and it saves
03:14 - everything in the browser's local
03:16 - storage and they're supposed to stay
03:17 - logged in unless they actually log
03:19 - themselves out with the log out button
03:22 - so I'm having two problems one users
03:25 - keep getting logged out and they're
03:27 - saying that they haven't tried to log
03:29 - out they can't remember what they can't
03:34 - remember ever like running some type of
03:38 - program that would have logged them out
03:40 - like cleared out all their local storage
03:41 - so basically they're getting logged out
03:44 - for no apparent reason and I haven't
03:47 - been able to recreate the issue
03:49 - I've tried probably dozens of times have
03:52 - gone to the you know different computers
03:55 - that the actual computers where it's
03:57 - happening for the users and I can't get
03:59 - it to happen again and then the other
04:01 - issue is when they try to log back in
04:04 - and have that that magic link sent to
04:06 - them again they're not seeing the emails
04:09 - I'm using SendGrid for emails and the
04:12 - SendGrid analytics it says that the
04:14 - emails are actually delivered but
04:17 - they're not they're not showing up in
04:19 - their inbox or in the junk mail folders
04:22 - for these people so just just one of
04:26 - anyone
04:27 - using either SendGrid or r0 or both of
04:30 - them together if you've had any issues
04:33 - like that especially issues with local
04:36 - storage being cleared out randomly from
04:39 - the browser or with emails some some
04:43 - people just not getting emails on the
04:45 - same system I'm on the same email system
04:47 - and I tested it earlier I got the email
04:50 - within a minute
04:52 - so I don't the issues so sorry for the
04:56 - little sidebar there let's get back to
05:00 - the testing so basically the first thing
05:06 - I want to do is show you how to set up
05:10 - the a mobile device for testing so
05:13 - there's not a lot you have to do
05:15 - actually on the phone so I'm not going
05:16 - to show you the phone part of it but you
05:20 - can look it up it's usually it's pretty
05:23 - easy you'd have to go into your settings
05:26 - under your advanced settings and there's
05:28 - like a developer mode I think you have
05:31 - to click on the version number in
05:36 - settings like seven times
05:38 - it's really weird I'm this is for
05:40 - Android by the way so I you can hook up
05:43 - an iPhone and do debugging as well but
05:48 - it's a different since I don't have an
05:49 - iPhone right now I'm not going to go
05:52 - over that maybe we'll do it in a
05:54 - different video so basically you have to
05:59 - enable developer options and you do that
06:04 - by I can't remember exactly what you
06:06 - clicked I've already done it but I think
06:08 - it's like the Android version number
06:11 - when you go into settings and about and
06:13 - you have to click it I think seven times
06:15 - and then will ask you do want to enable
06:17 - developer options yes and then you have
06:20 - this extra thing in your menu this extra
06:23 - item so you can go into there and enable
06:27 - USB debugging so that's what you want
06:30 - you want to be able to enable USB
06:31 - debugging so if you haven't Android you
06:33 - want to do this Google enable USB
06:35 - debugging on and
06:37 - and it will let you know exactly what
06:39 - the steps are since I camera I'm almost
06:42 - positive that the way I described it is
06:44 - how it went but it's been so long since
06:46 - I've done it I can't be sure so you
06:49 - probably want to double-check I don't
06:51 - have a link right now so sorry if I if I
06:55 - have time and I remember which I
06:56 - probably want I'll throw the link in the
06:59 - description normally I would throw the
07:01 - link in but I'm just really pressed for
07:03 - time to get this site launched so now
07:07 - I'm going to show you how to link up
07:11 - your device so if you open up dev tools
07:14 - okay which you can just click on inspect
07:18 - anywhere and that will open up dev tools
07:20 - for you
07:22 - let me how's the font on dev tools do I
07:25 - need to make it bigger let me know
07:30 - alright somebody in a live chat said
07:32 - it's not the Android version number it's
07:34 - the compilation number or something like
07:35 - that I think you're right I can't
07:37 - remember it was some some number in
07:40 - there I know that's not great
07:42 - information but I'm you'll be able to
07:46 - find it the information is really easy
07:48 - to find if you want like a step by step
07:50 - if you go to Udacity they actually show
07:54 - you this in in one of their courses they
07:56 - have like a link to a video it's their
08:00 - course on my like mobile is a responsive
08:08 - images something like that sorry that's
08:11 - not good advice I think so let me make
08:19 - this bigger and move this up here so you
08:25 - can see what's going on okay so we have
08:30 - some of the live chat saying we do need
08:32 - it bigger okay that's probably as big as
08:35 - I can make it without blocking out stuff
08:37 - that we need to see so all I've done is
08:41 - I've connected my my phone to the
08:45 - computer so I have for this phone it's
08:48 - one of the USBC
08:50 - so I have a connector that's just a
08:53 - regular USB on one end and then a new
08:55 - USBC on the other end going into my
08:56 - phone so that's plugged in I've enabled
08:59 - USB debugging on my phone now I just
09:03 - open dev tools and I go I click on this
09:06 - it probably will be clicked on by
09:09 - default discover USB devices when I do
09:12 - that then it brings up this pixel so I
09:16 - can see it over here and I'll actually
09:17 - if you click it it will show you open
09:21 - windows that you have I've done one
09:23 - other steps since we're developing this
09:25 - locally if you're not testing a site
09:28 - locally if you're testing a site that's
09:29 - available you know online from a normal
09:31 - URL you can skip this step but since we
09:35 - have a local server running we want to
09:37 - match up the ports so I just used
09:41 - localhost 8080 this first number is for
09:46 - my phone the second one is what port
09:50 - we're running it on so I'm actually
09:51 - running this local server on port 3000
09:55 - so I just I added a rule when I entered
09:59 - these two numbers in now when I go on my
10:03 - phone to localhost 8080 I can actually
10:07 - see the development side I know you guys
10:09 - can't see it I was trying to I have a
10:14 - program there let me share my phone
10:16 - screen but for some reason it wasn't
10:17 - working I kind of think that because I'm
10:20 - using the ports it's like one of the
10:22 - ports that that was also using and so I
10:25 - messed it up but I didn't really have
10:28 - time to troubleshoot so now that you're
10:33 - linked up you can go I can go into my
10:38 - pixel and see I have been saying the
10:43 - port forwarding is working and I want to
10:46 - inspect let's enter URL so you can I can
10:51 - enter this localhost 8080 and click open
11:03 - and this should work okay I guess not
11:10 - there we go it just took a second but
11:13 - see it on my phone it just opened it and
11:16 - now I can see that tab here that
11:18 - localhost:8080 and now I can it inspect
11:21 - okay and now my inspector it's taking a
11:29 - second to load but now this section once
11:33 - it loads this section will actually
11:36 - correspond to what's on my phone so the
11:38 - cool thing is now if I go over and
11:41 - change some Styles here it'll show up on
11:45 - my phone in real time so I can test it
11:49 - out it's a little bit nicer than just
11:52 - kind of shrinking your window because
11:55 - you get to you'll really see like how if
11:58 - you have let's say some type of scroll
12:00 - tracking or click function or something
12:02 - you can see how it is with the touch I
12:05 - know you can simulate some of this with
12:09 - dev tools but if you have a device you
12:14 - don't have to have every device if you
12:15 - just get one device and try things out
12:18 - on it it's really worthwhile so in
12:24 - general I just you know click around and
12:27 - see see what's working what's not
12:32 - working so there's definitely some delay
12:38 - so just a heads-up on that every time I
12:42 - go to click on a link it doesn't refresh
12:45 - right away there's this a delay so
12:55 - alright so I'm not going to spend a lot
12:57 - of time on that I just wanted to show
12:59 - you how to set that up because I didn't
13:02 - get the screen sharing working so it'd
13:04 - be really boring for you all to have me
13:06 - describe to you what I'm saying on my
13:08 - mobile the next way I'm going to test is
13:13 - with browser stacks
13:15 - I have this somewhere where did I put it
13:18 - okay here it is okay so we have thanks
13:30 - for the ports it sorry I'm just checking
13:32 - the live chat for a second make sure
13:37 - okay it looks like there's we don't have
13:39 - any questions or anything everybody's
13:41 - still following alright so I'm going to
13:43 - go in here in a browser stack now I can
13:48 - I normally just use Xcode since I'm on a
13:52 - Mac and I test directly on my Mac
13:54 - instead of going in to a browser stack
13:57 - but since I have have to install updates
14:01 - before that'll work let's go in we'll
14:05 - just try this iPhone 6's I don't have a
14:09 - lot of like really good analytics data
14:11 - on the actual type of iPhone devices
14:18 - exercise I don't know my screen is maybe
14:22 - 27 I sorry I just lost my train of
14:30 - thought if you're just joining in you
14:32 - missed at the beginning I apologize in
14:34 - advance I'm really not feeling well so
14:37 - the the streams going to be a little bit
14:39 - a little bit off I'm just not going to
14:43 - be as as on top of things as I normally
14:45 - would be so you have to wait this is
14:53 - browser stack is it's pretty good hey
14:56 - this is it actually saved the last site
14:58 - I looked at on here probably not me this
15:02 - is a somebody we share an account me and
15:07 - another developer so that's probably
15:11 - it's like he was testing so basically I
15:13 - I have a phone here I don't know if I
15:17 - can make this bigger so I'm sorry if
15:18 - this is small it looks small for me so
15:23 - I'll just give you kind of an idea of
15:26 - how to do this
15:29 - now some things on browserstack allow
15:32 - you to do port forwarding last time I
15:35 - use this which is within the last few
15:38 - months you could not do it with the
15:41 - iPhones so I'm not going to try to do it
15:44 - right now
15:45 - you can do it I think with Windows based
15:48 - things windows-based browsers so you
15:54 - might want to check that out that would
15:55 - also be cool so in this case I'm just
15:57 - going to go to our test you are out and
16:07 - it's it's pretty much up to date there's
16:09 - a couple of things I did that I didn't
16:11 - push to the to the server yet but for
16:14 - the most part test code catechins calm
16:18 - let's see okay it's not it's not working
16:25 - let me go back here and see if it's
16:27 - working on on my brother okay wow it is
16:35 - working let me refresh one more son good
16:43 - thing we're testing let's try to go to
16:47 - maybe one of the interior pages see if
16:50 - we have a better look No
16:53 - all right now we can't open dev tools
16:55 - here so let's open dev tools and see
16:56 - what we're getting
16:57 - can't find variable and it's unexpected
17:01 - NFR this card hmm
17:18 - all right let's see where this is that
17:21 - it's possible it's not showing me hmm
17:35 - let's see I want to go and shovel it
17:43 - looks like it's not even loading I want
17:47 - to check to make sure okay it is loading
17:51 - our our app all right dodge it is okay
18:02 - okay it's linked two of them all right
18:08 - so what did it say 121 this this card
18:13 - team card clickhandler okay
18:22 - yeah the lab says somebody asks is
18:23 - browserstack free there is a free trial
18:25 - it doesn't let you do a lot though so
18:28 - yeah this is not a free tool yeah you
18:31 - can use Xcode to simulate an iPhone on
18:34 - your computer for free if you have a Mac
18:37 - so I would normally I like to use that
18:41 - better than trying to simulate iPhones
18:44 - and browserstack and then if you have a
18:47 - device the actual physical device of
18:49 - course you can test with that but I
18:55 - think probably what's happening with the
18:59 - iPhone and I'll need to I'm going to
19:01 - test this with an actual device just so
19:04 - it's a little bit faster for me after I
19:06 - update Xcode probably what's happening
19:09 - and I don't know why this just slipped
19:12 - my mind before is I'm using a lot of
19:15 - things from es6 I don't know what the
19:19 - coverage is on mobile safari for es6
19:24 - it's possible that that's messing some
19:27 - of this this up
19:30 - I don't know we'll see yeah because the
19:35 - first the first time I use something
19:37 - that's es6 is at line 21 and I'm using
19:41 - let instead of their and that's the
19:44 - first error we got so I'm guessing
19:47 - Mobile Safari does not support let so
19:51 - I'll have to use Babel and transpile
19:57 - that into es5 code and then try again on
20:02 - an iPhone but what we can do is try to
20:09 - go I don't think I have a page that
20:12 - isn't using some type of es6 we can
20:20 - transpile real quick and do it I mean we
20:22 - have that might be worthwhile worthwhile
20:26 - to do so if you've never used es6 or
20:29 - babel before let's try it out okay so
20:39 - you need to let's see let me grab all of
20:49 - my app touches so basically this
20:56 - JavaScript that you're writing in your
20:58 - components you're fine with it's going
21:00 - to be automatically transpired but since
21:04 - we imported this a tas file from our
21:07 - previous static site then we just
21:09 - brought it in and have it in the static
21:11 - folder i next doesn't automatically
21:13 - transpile that for you that's something
21:15 - I'd have to set up probably as an NPM
21:19 - script in the package.json file so I
21:22 - have not set that up yet I've set it up
21:25 - in a previous project at some point I'm
21:27 - probably just going to copy that code
21:29 - into there but I haven't done it yet so
21:32 - what we can do now is just kind of
21:34 - manually transpile this just so that we
21:37 - can do some testing so I just copy this
21:41 - in on this side and you can see
21:44 - using let me make this bigger I'll make
21:49 - this whole thing bigger okay so on this
21:53 - side we have some es6 stuffs we have let
21:56 - what else we have I'm probably using
21:59 - cost in some places too I'm using
22:02 - template literal syntax so we go over to
22:05 - this side we can see that let has been
22:09 - changed into two there and I'm not going
22:15 - to look for the template literal syntax
22:16 - but if you basically what it would do is
22:20 - just use regular quotation marks and you
22:24 - know your plus signs mix in with your
22:27 - variables so your file is going to be a
22:29 - little bit bigger after you do this but
22:33 - older browsers will be able to use it so
22:35 - I'm just going to copy this for now and
22:39 - [Music]
22:40 - let's see what the best way to do this I
22:43 - I'm just going to I'm just going to go
22:52 - and paste this all in and overwrite this
22:54 - file for now because we have this this
22:59 - saves the lemming let me just throw this
23:02 - in another file just to say that okay
23:10 - just in case we need to go back
23:13 - okay so let's save and we're going to go
23:20 - over I'm going to put this on the server
23:22 - really quick it should take probably two
23:25 - minutes - I'll let you guys see this I
23:32 - showed everybody yesterday but just in
23:34 - case you don't know how I'm putting
23:36 - things on the server right now this is
23:41 - the tooth let's make this a bit bigger
23:46 - okay so this is my local machine I'm
23:49 - just going to do a git commit
23:56 - so we're just going to transpile we're
24:02 - going to push that to github and then
24:06 - let's go back here I've just used SSH to
24:11 - go into the server on digital ocean and
24:14 - now I'm in to see them it looks
24:17 - different a username Jessie now we're
24:22 - going to go into our folder and we're
24:28 - going to stop stop our our app for just
24:37 - a minute we'll do a get pool and we'll
24:42 - do we'll do a build as soon as this
24:52 - builds over we'll just start up our
24:53 - server again and then we're good to go
24:55 - with our testing we go right back in now
24:57 - we shouldn't get the errors from the ESX
25:00 - stuff so so I didn't think of that
25:03 - beforehand just working on a lot of
25:06 - other stuff today and I did not think
25:09 - about it okay so Patrick and a live chat
25:16 - says can I use as mobile safari should
25:18 - support let since late last year okay
25:22 - well I'm not sure what the problem was
25:25 - then I mean we're definitely getting an
25:27 - error on the the line that I first used
25:30 - let with so I'm not actually I don't
25:34 - remember what version of Safari I was
25:37 - testing with browser stack it's possible
25:39 - that I was testing an older version
25:41 - we'll go back in and see what the
25:44 - version is all right so now our build is
25:49 - ready let me start everything up and we
25:54 - should be good to go so let's go back
25:56 - over here and let's try oops let's try
26:04 - to go back all right
26:06 - and it works so
26:10 - I'm not sure what what the problem was
26:16 - for sure I think it was let and this is
26:19 - probably just an older version of Safari
26:23 - but now at least we can scroll down let
26:27 - me see if I can make this bigger hmm all
26:38 - right since device is already to actual
26:40 - size so I guess it's not okay so this is
26:44 - browsers iOS 9 so this is Safari in an
26:49 - iOS version 9 what's the newest one is
26:54 - it is 10
26:55 - okay so nice you gather you already
26:58 - uncovered in the live chat support for 4
27:02 - let which is an es6 thing starts in
27:05 - version 10.2 ok and somebody mentions
27:16 - something about the auth0 stuff I don't
27:19 - want to interrupt right now so towards
27:21 - the end I'm going to come back to that
27:22 - thanks for for mentioning that I'll just
27:27 - say for now I'm not using an iframe to
27:32 - log out on the log out is basically I
27:35 - just clear local storage when they click
27:38 - the button but people are saying that
27:40 - they're not clicking the button and the
27:42 - local storage is still being cleared
27:43 - when I go to check their their browsers
27:47 - there's nothing in local storage but I
27:50 - can't get it to clear on you know just
27:52 - on its own again I can't recreate the
27:55 - problem ok so I'm going to scroll down a
28:00 - little bit I realize this is super small
28:08 - yeah and I don't I don't know how to to
28:11 - make this bigger except to I can zoom
28:16 - into the site itself let's see if I can
28:18 - zoom in here all right okay so the
28:22 - uh you know just the zoom from the
28:25 - touchpad on an eye and I like the iMac
28:31 - magic touch pad works okay so we got a
28:34 - little bigger here so I'm just going to
28:35 - scroll you don't get like the real
28:38 - feeling of scrolling I'm you know I'm
28:40 - using my touchpad to scroll but we can
28:44 - do some some clicking around okay so
28:47 - that works yeah it's a little bit weird
28:55 - to try to get the touch the touch stuff
28:58 - down I keep like accidentally clicking
29:03 - where I don't want to click or like
29:06 - double clicking when I don't want to see
29:09 - you Keith
29:12 - maybe it's maybe it's because I zoomed
29:14 - in let me zoom out again and see if I if
29:17 - it's better
29:19 - that's it yeah I can't win if we zoom in
29:23 - the the clicking doesn't work so I love
29:27 - it I'm going to scroll just quickly see
29:30 - if I can find something that looks weird
29:32 - and then if I do I'll scroll in on that
29:35 - I want to try out the side knife and the
29:38 - links so we'll try out this link okay
29:41 - that worked that was cool that was
29:42 - actually really fast okay
29:45 - I'm going to take I'm actually going to
29:47 - take the images out on mobile and just
29:49 - have the title up here because they
29:53 - won't look as good on mobile anyway and
29:55 - I don't I don't want to kill people's
29:57 - data plans by having them load images
30:00 - when they're not necessary all right so
30:03 - this these sections are actually going
30:05 - to change so I'm not that worried about
30:06 - it now I'm just I have some different
30:08 - content I need to put in okay so these
30:11 - cards look good on mobile everything
30:14 - works these are still need to edit these
30:17 - images to make them all square and the
30:19 - same so right now I'm looking for items
30:23 - that I I don't already know about the
30:28 - neat change alright so I am interested
30:32 - in this Oh
30:35 - so that does work if let me zoom in here
30:38 - and show you what's going on with this
30:40 - so this gave me some problems this
30:42 - morning
30:42 - some people have super long titles and
30:46 - they won't fit on the card so if they
30:50 - were rapping below and adding another
30:52 - line or sometimes two lines and then of
30:54 - course the text was spilling out of the
30:56 - bottom of this card so that the solution
31:02 - would have been okay well let's just
31:03 - make the card bigger but the problem is
31:05 - I don't have great quality images to
31:09 - work with so some of the images I have
31:10 - are already less than 100 pixels by 100
31:14 - pixels and so that's what I have here
31:16 - these are 100 by hundred pixels so I
31:18 - wanted to keep this and keep this 100
31:20 - pixels in height so I settled on this
31:23 - which I don't really like this solution
31:26 - but I just don't have time to mess with
31:30 - it more right now so I decided actually
31:32 - on a horizontal scroll so you can scroll
31:35 - over and see the rest of the title so on
31:41 - larger screens this isn't an issue if
31:45 - you think of another solution
31:49 - somebody said truncate in the live chat
31:53 - yeah I could possibly truncate it and
31:57 - then when you click it let me show what
31:58 - happens when you click when you click it
32:00 - it comes up with a modal and gives you a
32:02 - lot more information on the person so I
32:07 - could possibly truncate and then have
32:09 - the full title in the modal I've thought
32:12 - about that I'll have to I don't know if
32:16 - I'll have time to do that before we
32:17 - launch but I'm going to put that on my
32:19 - list I have a Trello board that's
32:22 - keeping track of everything since I'm
32:24 - zoomed in it's not letting me click out
32:27 - there we go
32:29 - so yeah that probably is going to be the
32:35 - best thing just truncate this limited to
32:37 - a certain number of characters and then
32:40 - have the full one
32:42 - be in the in the modal so I like that
32:46 - advise yeah
32:49 - actually that's that's what I did
32:50 - overflow wise scroll somebody mentioned
32:52 - change the font size I don't know the
32:55 - fonts already small I could probably
32:57 - make it smaller and get away with it at
32:59 - least on on mobile there's there's just
33:03 - a lot of overflow yeah I just I wish
33:09 - some of these titles weren't quite so
33:11 - long and it's not just one or two I mean
33:13 - they're like quite a few of these that
33:15 - have the super long titles so I am
33:21 - eventually going to change this for now
33:22 - this is probably how it's going to look
33:24 - for launch since we're launching
33:26 - tomorrow
33:28 - let me check to make sure this works
33:30 - oops maybe it's not working let's see am
33:36 - I getting an error okay when I click
33:44 - this it should open and it's not opening
33:48 - on this phone let me refresh really
33:51 - quick Wow oh that's not refresh that's
33:55 - wish it looked like the refresh button
33:57 - but it's really not okay so let me there
34:02 - we go
34:02 - let me find I've DS the refresh button
34:05 - on the device just to see what's going
34:11 - on okay that did work
34:21 - let's go back I've put in like
34:25 - client-side routing now I'm going to go
34:28 - back into teams to see if it works so
34:30 - the thing with client-side running if
34:32 - you watch yesterday we went over
34:33 - problems that you might have with jQuery
34:37 - ok and I think this is an issue so
34:40 - normally like I would initialize this
34:43 - this click Handler to open these and the
34:46 - document.ready function for jQuery but
34:51 - it's not going to fire like if we're
34:53 - just doing client-side routing and
34:54 - there's no page refresh that function is
34:56 - never going to fire again so the first
34:59 - time it fires it'll be honest different
35:01 - page it won't actually see those
35:02 - sections so it won't have anything to
35:05 - grab onto to to watch so what we have to
35:10 - do is instead use like component
35:13 - component did mount and then call it in
35:16 - there so we pull it out of the document
35:18 - already we put in a separate function
35:20 - that's available globally and then we
35:21 - call it from within our component when
35:23 - it mounts so for some reason either I
35:27 - forgot to do that for this or I didn't
35:29 - it's not working so I need to add that
35:31 - to the list so I'll show you how I keep
35:34 - track of all these things so go over
35:36 - here I have my Trello board so I'll just
35:40 - put it over here and say um fix uh
35:46 - section and look for routines
36:03 - or teams with client-side routing and
36:12 - I'm going to estimate that's going to
36:13 - take one Pomodoro cycle that's what this
36:14 - one is one 25-minute cycle okay somebody
36:23 - else Humberto in the live chat says they
36:27 - like the overflow ellipsis option yeah I
36:31 - think that'll look that'll look ok we'll
36:33 - probably end up going with that at some
36:35 - point and all right so now that that bug
36:40 - is it's tracked I'll get to it let's
36:45 - let's move on I'm actually doing a
36:47 - similar thing in another page so I
36:49 - really want to see if it's working on
36:51 - the other page and did I do it
36:53 - differently on two different pages so
36:54 - we're going to go over to courses and
37:00 - let's see if it works here all right it
37:07 - doesn't so I'm having the same issue on
37:09 - both these pages so let's just go back
37:11 - and add four teams and sort and courses
37:23 - look good
37:29 - all right so good thing this is a small
37:31 - site we're already halfway through it
37:34 - let's check out the events page see
37:37 - what's going on here and not a lot we
37:38 - have that's not bad maybe you could use
37:43 - some padding changes but it it doesn't
37:46 - look too bad
37:48 - that's excellent or to read on that
37:51 - background doesn't it this let me zoom
37:54 - in maybe it's just the zoom so I will
38:01 - try to zoom that was that what's broken
38:08 - I been here for like the frame of the
38:13 - word in YouTube okay oh the YouTube has
38:16 - the YouTube embed messed this up see if
38:21 - we can well it looks like a frozen my my
38:29 - test here so maybe if I can't get this
38:34 - to work again we'll switch and test
38:37 - something else and then come back to
38:38 - this one hmm
38:43 - okay so that's frozen so let's let's
38:47 - switch over now just for a minute and
38:50 - I'll show you what let's check out we'll
38:54 - do Windows 10 and let's check out
38:58 - Internet Explorer 11
39:11 - hopefully I won't have to worry about
39:13 - supporting this for very much longer but
39:16 - you can see I always have issues with in
39:20 - an explorer 11 and mobile safari a lot
39:24 - of the issues I know about beforehand so
39:26 - I can I can edit my my code to make sure
39:31 - that I fix them but you can see like I
39:34 - was using flexbox to vertical line
39:38 - things see it's not working in an
39:41 - explorer 11 so you have to set up
39:45 - alternate styles for internet explorer
39:48 - 11 some padding or something as we
39:53 - scroll down at least this works and
40:01 - let's go go to the home page see how
40:07 - this is gone we have here okay so for
40:16 - some reason the images aren't loading
40:22 - off to check that out we can also we can
40:30 - inspect but the inspector is not is not
40:39 - great for this so you can't have to have
40:42 - a lot of patience to inspect things when
40:46 - you're working with older browsers it
40:49 - said it may take a few minutes to start
40:51 - I don't think I want to wait a few
40:53 - minutes let's just this is good a team
40:56 - now we're also using oh man look at that
41:02 - Wow
41:04 - so that scrollbar shows up because even
41:08 - though we're not actually there's no
41:09 - overflow that scrollbar so show them
41:12 - that's no good all right I'm gonna have
41:18 - to figure out if there's a way to hide
41:23 - the scrollbar
41:24 - and in and explore 11
41:37 - and I don't want to spend too much time
41:39 - I'm going to give myself one Pomodoro
41:42 - session so one 25 minute period because
41:46 - I if I can't find answer quickly I'll
41:49 - probably it'll be a waste of time I
41:51 - don't have all that time right now so I
41:54 - kind of think that you can't hide these
41:56 - but we'll see maybe maybe there's a way
42:00 - I know you could do more with scroll
42:02 - bars and like earlier versions of
42:04 - Internet Explorer I remember making like
42:06 - neon green colored scroll bars made like
42:12 - 15 years ago or so I think but I haven't
42:15 - done that for a while and I don't know
42:16 - if you can still do it let's go to the
42:19 - news page and I just want to see if ok
42:24 - so that's that routing that
42:26 - parameterised routing that we had set up
42:29 - it's definitely working and that's good
42:31 - check our resources ok let's see I want
42:39 - to see if these tabs will all the
42:40 - scrolls like not great on this okay so
42:50 - to see now this isn't working
42:52 - so our our tabs are not working so let's
42:58 - put this oops
43:12 - so as expected Internet Explorer 11 is
43:18 - giving us some some issues it doesn't
43:20 - matter what you do it's your site's
43:23 - never going to look as good and Explorer
43:26 - 11 as it will in more in modern browsers
43:29 - I mean unless your site's really simple
43:31 - it might look exactly the same but you
43:34 - just can't take advantage of all the
43:36 - same things that you normally would
43:39 - would be able to in a modern browser so
43:41 - we're not going to try to make this site
43:43 - exactly the same the percentage of our
43:47 - users that are on Internet Explorer 11
43:50 - is really small if the issues were like
43:54 - a really a big deal
43:57 - like major functionality and menu is use
44:01 - then you can just put a message I hate
44:05 - to do this sometimes you have to you can
44:08 - just pop a message up that detects the
44:09 - browser and says you know hey if you're
44:11 - using Internet Explorer you're not going
44:15 - to have a great experience and then
44:17 - provide a link to download you know some
44:19 - newer browsers you don't even have to
44:22 - write that code yourself there's already
44:23 - some plugins that will just do it for
44:25 - you so I'm going to check the live chat
44:32 - real quick because I just wanted to show
44:36 - you how I'm doing my testing I think
44:38 - it's probably a little bit boring to
44:40 - watch me go through here and just find
44:43 - the errors and log them I'm not actually
44:44 - fixing anything right now so I don't
44:48 - want to spend a ton of time on it I'm
44:50 - going to check the live chat quickly and
44:52 - then I have a video another video from
44:55 - syntax con with some advice for new
44:58 - programmers and this this video is from
45:02 - Kim Creighton shoes and excellent
45:04 - speakers she was one of like the keynote
45:06 - speakers at the conference and she's
45:10 - actually not a coder but she speaks at a
45:12 - ton of coding conferences and it was
45:18 - great if you ever have a chance to see
45:20 - her speak or watch one her videos I
45:22 - recommend it it's like
45:24 - she is nice like perspective on like
45:27 - mentoring and company culture so it's
45:31 - really really kind of cool stuff you
45:35 - don't usually hear at tech conferences
45:38 - okay let me check okay so I was getting
45:47 - some people talking about the question I
45:49 - asked at the beginning about auth0 and
45:53 - in the emails and stuff
45:55 - somebody says could there be a problem
45:56 - with SMTP it's possible okay so I did
46:06 - mention how to do the Android testing
46:09 - and someone a live chat said it's the
46:12 - tutorial on how to do that isn't the
46:14 - responsive design for images course on
46:16 - Udacity that's a free course I did go
46:19 - through that course I recommend it I
46:22 - learned a lot of stuff and a lot of the
46:25 - things in there are still very relevant
46:27 - even though the courses on a probably a
46:30 - couple years old at this point I can't
46:32 - remember when it came out officially but
46:34 - the things that I learned in that course
46:36 - are still still relevant someone
46:43 - mentioned that they don't devote for
46:44 - edge but it can be surprisingly
46:46 - compatible yeah I had a lot of hope for
46:49 - edge but it's just not a lot of people
46:52 - aren't using it based on my analytics
46:54 - for my sites it's there a small
46:56 - percentage of people so that's why I
46:58 - don't usually test things on edge it's
47:02 - just not worth the time you know for
47:04 - like 1% of the users
47:17 - okay
47:27 - okay someone mentioned materialized does
47:29 - have the truncate class that's right I
47:32 - forgot about that so there is a truncate
47:35 - class the only I'll have to see how they
47:40 - do it on with materialized I know there
47:47 - was actually some like CSS truncation
47:50 - that can go on but I don't know what the
47:53 - browser support is but that's a good
47:55 - that's a good point
47:56 - I'm definitely going to going to check
47:59 - that out if someone said that a slow
48:08 - connection they couldn't see the title
48:09 - bar sorry about that oh nice okay John
48:15 - Hanson thank you very much he threw in
48:17 - some of the CSS to be able to hide the
48:22 - scroll bar so that definitely saves you
48:25 - some time and I need some time savers
48:29 - here so I really appreciate that
48:35 - Patrick asked since you're estimating
48:38 - pomodoro cycles to use a Pomodoro clock
48:40 - while you work I do so I use a Pomodoro
48:43 - clock oh let me show you the one I use I
48:48 - use just a super simple web-based one
48:53 - since this tomato timer so it's really
48:57 - bare-bones I can do formula recession of
49:00 - 25 minutes your short break of five
49:02 - minutes or long break of 10 I usually go
49:05 - five minutes between cycles every four
49:07 - cycles I do 10-minute break and I just
49:11 - use this I like it you know runs right
49:13 - in the browser so it's easy I tried out
49:15 - some apps before that have more features
49:17 - but usually I don't use any of the other
49:20 - features so it just kind of clutters
49:21 - things so using this right now at some
49:23 - point I'd like to actually build my own
49:25 - and customize it to exactly what I need
49:28 - but I don't have time for that right now
49:31 - maybe one day okay
49:37 - Paul asks how is he sliding the full
49:39 - screen
49:40 - then right I'm on a Mac so yes so if
49:44 - you're using the touchpad for your Mac
49:48 - on a laptop or on a desktop and you use
49:51 - three fingers and swipe it then that'll
49:54 - that will change it so this is just a
49:56 - three-finger swipe so it's super helpful
50:02 - there is a way to make that work on
50:04 - Windows it's you have to download a
50:06 - program and set it up but I'm pretty
50:08 - sure you can get a similar thing on
50:10 - Windows I mean I don't know what you
50:14 - obviously wouldn't probably would be
50:15 - using a touchpad on Windows desktop but
50:17 - there would be probably some type of key
50:19 - I think there's a key combination like
50:21 - control some there's some like key combo
50:26 - that can do this on a Mac as well if you
50:28 - don't want to use the the swipes okay so
50:39 - get through the live chat if you have
50:41 - anything else to ask go ahead I'll check
50:42 - it one more time after I play this video
50:45 - but let me get with the video going this
50:48 - one's a little bit longer Kim had a lot
50:51 - of good advice so this will be a few
50:53 - minutes most of the other videos have
50:55 - been like a minute or less so let me
50:59 - bring in I'll bring this in and let's
51:07 - make it fullscreen and let me let me
51:13 - play this uh hopefully the audio is is
51:17 - works there's at one point at the end of
51:19 - this I think there's some background
51:20 - noise so I hope you'll be able to hear
51:23 - this and once again this is this is Kim
51:26 - Creighton from syntax con hello everyone
51:32 - I'm Tim Creighton and you can find my
51:34 - Twitter it Khem creative board in this
51:37 - ki elements are elección in one I am
51:42 - here at six hack conference and one of
51:47 - the things that I'm supposed to say
51:51 - what's knowledge now exciting
51:52 - first first of all Benton right I'm a
51:55 - community engineer which means I help
51:57 - community efforts I help people in the
52:01 - technology space embrace change the
52:05 - convoy elusive and diversity diverse
52:07 - when it comes to people there is
52:10 - backgrounds become a welcomed use like a

52:51 - very exciting a friend they I went to
52:54 - their house and they had set it up in
52:56 - their house and I spent two hours plan
52:59 - is free of your system and by the time I
53:02 - was done I was four ounce with but I've
53:05 - had so much fun so I'm really interested
53:07 - in seeing how that technology is that
53:10 - advanced where it will be less about the
53:14 - gear and more accessible to other people
53:17 - how are you using it in just in everyday
53:20 - life it will be very interesting to how
53:22 - they I and a mini reality - I mean a are
53:27 - augmented reality and virtual reality
53:29 - are going to be used in just everyday
53:32 - lives and so the one thing I would tell
53:35 - newbies one of the pieces of Isis that's
53:37 - become is all time is about mentoring so
53:39 - everybody to become creative reading
53:42 - it's virtually impossible for most
53:44 - people who come to you they're very live
53:45 - without on the mentor just for the
53:48 - simple fact that this is like the Wild
53:50 - West
53:50 - there is no there is no defined path
53:54 - winners if you want to be a doctor
53:55 - there's a divine path if you want to be
53:57 - a dentist there's a defined path if you
53:59 - want to be educated in SIA pet if you
54:02 - want to be a developer you go
54:03 - taxi garbage gets to me and wake up
54:05 - today dislike one of your developer and
54:07 - can learn everything you need to learn
54:08 - to be a developer so there's no more fun
54:10 - iPad and without somebody more similar
54:12 - to help guy what you're doing you often
54:15 - find yourself and you've down this
54:16 - rabbit holes or feeling really
54:18 - discouraged and so mentors really help
54:20 - but I'll give you some advice on how to
54:22 - get an intern mentoring it's all the
54:24 - mouth relationships so if one image
54:29 - don't go to some lesson hey I need a
54:30 - mentor this is what I want to learn
54:32 - that's not how that works
54:33 - oh you want somebody who's going to
54:35 - invest in you and your success and that
54:37 - only happens in the care that they care
54:39 - about you know where they're going to
54:40 - care about you is if they have a
54:43 - relationship with you so five ways to
54:45 - volunteer in your community a lot of
54:48 - ways to ask my ways to ask how can I
54:53 - help for you ask them to help you and
54:56 - what happens is you'll find that they'll
54:59 - go to you they'll see this or asking you
55:01 - hey what are you working on how can I
55:03 - help and then it becomes like them
55:05 - you're advocating that's what you want
55:06 - they want your first job to come from
55:08 - your network you don't want to get your
55:10 - first job because it was posted on the
55:12 - website you want to be there so badly
55:14 - about you before they of a full set job
55:16 - you want to be the candidate before
55:17 - their jobs even post it so the best way
55:19 - to do that is to build your
55:20 - relationships and get you over time
55:23 - thank you
55:27 - all right so hopefully that was helpful
55:30 - to some of you I know I am I think a
55:36 - mentor would be really helpful I didn't
55:37 - really have I kind of had a mentor uh
55:41 - but it was more in like in general like
55:47 - digital marketing so search engine
55:49 - optimization and SUV by copywriting and
55:51 - things so I never really had like a
55:54 - programmer mentor and even now I you
55:58 - know I already have a full-time job
56:00 - doing this I can still see the value and
56:02 - having a mentor and I've been able to be
56:05 - somewhat of a mentor to to some some of
56:10 - the students here who are interested in
56:13 - programming and it's it's awesome
56:17 - I mean you know I can see whenever I
56:21 - help people out make it they get through
56:25 - things a lot faster than I get through
56:27 - things because I can point them to a
56:29 - resource that I know is good I know the
56:33 - problems that they'll probably run into
56:35 - before they do
56:36 - so whereas it would take me a long time
56:39 - and I would work through some resources
56:42 - that weren't very helpful before I found
56:44 - the right ones you know if if you're
56:49 - mentoring someone you can help them get
56:50 - through that faster or if you're seeking
56:52 - out a mentor they can help you get
56:54 - through that faster so you just don't
56:56 - waste your time going down dead-end
56:59 - paths people that have been doing this
57:03 - for longer have a much better idea of of
57:06 - the big picture and I can can direct you
57:09 - to where you need to go and what you
57:11 - need to learn so good advice from from
57:15 - Kim and I don't see all right we don't
57:19 - have any other questions in the live
57:20 - chat so I'm going to get to work
57:23 - tomorrow we're going to launch this site
57:25 - so the video that might already be
57:27 - launched by the time I do the video
57:29 - tomorrow I'm hoping it is maybe I'll
57:32 - have to just stay up late tonight and
57:35 - tomorrow and get it launched tomorrow
57:37 - night but hopefully it'll be ready
57:39 - enough to launch thanks for all your
57:42 - help I know you all put in some some
57:44 - really good advice too you know I asked
57:48 - a lot of questions of you this time
