00:00 - in this video i will be using vent
00:02 - diagrams to give a graphical
00:03 - representation of the set operators we
00:06 - learned in the previous video
00:08 - so if you recall the definition of a
00:10 - union b you know that a union b equals
00:12 - the set containing elements x such that
00:15 - x is an element of a or x is an element
00:18 - of b
00:19 - so if we let this circle represent the
00:21 - set a and we let this circle represent
00:23 - the set b
00:24 - then
00:25 - that means that x can land anywhere
00:28 - in any of these circles which is why
00:30 - this right the entire region is shaded
00:32 - red we're saying that this red region
00:35 - represents all possible values of x
00:38 - and if we recall the definition of a of
00:40 - a intersection b
00:42 - that equals the set containing elements
00:44 - x such that x is an element of a
00:46 - and x is an element of b
00:48 - which is why the overlap
00:51 - where a and b overlap is is shaded red
00:53 - we're saying all possible values of x
00:56 - are this red region now the set
00:58 - difference of a and b equals the set
01:01 - containing elements x
01:02 - such that x is an element of a
01:05 - and x is also not an element of b which
01:08 - is why it's just this region here none
01:10 - of the
01:12 - elements are within
01:13 - b
01:14 - the set difference of b and a
01:17 - is
01:18 - the set containing elements x such that
01:21 - x is an element of b
01:23 - and x is not an element of a and finally
01:27 - the symmetric difference of a and b i
01:29 - defined as
01:30 - the union of a minus b and b minus a so
01:35 - we take
01:36 - this region in this region and we take
01:39 - the union of it which is why this is the
01:41 - resulting region there's no overlap
01:44 - between the two
01:45 - now this is a really good way to
01:47 - familiarize yourself with the concept of
01:50 - set operators however don't rely on it
01:53 - you should really focus on the
01:54 - definitions as it will help you out in
01:57 - the long term
