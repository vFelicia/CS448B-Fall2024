00:00 - this course is from treehouse instructor
00:01 - and senior product designer hope
00:03 - armstrong you'll learn all you need to
00:05 - know about creating good typography
00:07 - which is one of the most important
00:09 - aspects of good design
00:13 - [Music]
00:20 - hey i'm hope armstrong a teacher and
00:22 - product designer here at treehouse
00:25 - every day you see typography in action
00:28 - it's on the menu of that restaurant you
00:30 - love eating at it's on road signs you
00:32 - drive by and it's definitely all over
00:35 - that favorite site of yours which is
00:37 - let's be honest tree house of course
00:40 - all that to say typography is everywhere
00:43 - whether people realize it or not
00:46 - something so ubiquitous is often taken
00:48 - for granted but it's really powerful as
00:51 - designs are often mostly comprised of
00:53 - type there's so much to learn
00:56 - first we need to understand what
00:58 - typography is
00:59 - on matthew butterick's site practical
01:01 - typography he defines the term simply as
01:05 - follows typography is the visual
01:07 - component of the written word
01:10 - this means typography comes into play
01:12 - when words are visually displayed on
01:14 - surfaces like screens paper posters
01:18 - signs and more
01:20 - though the words or content of something
01:22 - might remain the same the typography can
01:25 - change let's take a look
01:27 - here's the text i shot the serif we can
01:30 - shape how it looks through typography
01:33 - for example we could increase the size
01:35 - of the text and align it in the center
01:38 - we could change the typeface from
01:39 - georgia to futura and set it in
01:42 - uppercase letters
01:43 - we could also adjust the letter spacing
01:46 - or tracking between characters
01:49 - we could go on forever making different
01:51 - adjustments
01:52 - but i wanted to give you a quick sample
01:54 - of typography and action
01:57 - if you don't know how to do any of these
01:59 - things don't worry
02:01 - we'll cover how to practically apply all
02:04 - of this and more later on in the course
02:07 - so far we've seen that typography
02:09 - involves changing arranging or ordering
02:12 - type
02:13 - but we wouldn't want to do this without
02:15 - a purpose or reason as to why
02:18 - a major purpose behind typography is
02:21 - utility
02:22 - this means presenting the text in a way
02:25 - that is useful clear and legible to its
02:27 - reader
02:28 - the content of a webpage could be
02:30 - incredible
02:32 - but if the typography is lackluster then
02:35 - it's going to be difficult for people to
02:37 - read and navigate
02:39 - they'll either struggle through it or
02:41 - quit along the way
02:43 - both situations are undesirable
02:46 - this is why typography as utility is
02:48 - extremely important to present text in a
02:51 - way that's clear orderly and legible for
02:54 - readers and users of your site
02:57 - another purpose behind typography is
02:59 - designing for an emotional connection
03:02 - type can have a personality or mood
03:05 - it gives off a certain vibe and conveys
03:07 - something to the reader before they've
03:09 - even digested a single word on the page
03:13 - the flavor of your typography should
03:15 - match the voice of your content
03:17 - you wouldn't want something that looks
03:19 - like chocolate ice cream to taste like
03:21 - tater tots
03:23 - let's say you have an official serious
03:26 - business document that's set in a fun
03:29 - quirky typeface
03:31 - although the content might send the
03:32 - right message the design or typography
03:35 - would not at all
03:37 - as you practice typography you'll want
03:39 - to make sure the design aspect of it
03:41 - enhances the message at hand
03:43 - it can keep readers engaged and also
03:46 - create delight in them
03:48 - because so many different things can
03:50 - come into play
03:51 - good typography might seem a bit tricky
03:54 - at first to execute
03:56 - i like to think of it as striking a
03:58 - balance between utility and designing
04:00 - for an emotional connection
04:03 - throughout this course we'll look at
04:04 - different ways to maintain that balance
04:07 - because typography is one of the most
04:09 - important elements of design
04:12 - next i want to make a distinction
04:14 - between typography and lettering
04:16 - these are two fields that are popular
04:18 - today but commonly confused in the
04:21 - industry
04:22 - both deal with letter forms but in
04:24 - different ways
04:26 - typography involves working with
04:28 - pre-made letter systems like typefaces
04:30 - and fonts to layout and arrange content
04:34 - whereas lettering involves crafting
04:36 - letterforms for a single use and purpose
04:38 - instead of utilizing a pre-made letter
04:40 - system
04:41 - this definition is based on joseph
04:44 - alicio's article and the teacher's notes
04:46 - it's great for further reading
04:49 - now that we understand the difference
04:51 - our focus for this course will be on
04:53 - typography and you'll be able to use
04:55 - those terms correctly in your industry
04:59 - lastly let's look at what a typeface is
05:01 - and the elements that define and shape
05:03 - it
05:04 - the terms typeface and font are commonly
05:07 - used interchangeably today but they are
05:10 - distinctly different
05:11 - a typeface is the design of a collection
05:14 - of characters
05:15 - so the term should be used when talking
05:17 - about the look of those letters numbers
05:20 - and symbols
05:21 - for example
05:23 - i dig futura it's such a good looking
05:25 - typeface
05:27 - a font is a single instance or
05:29 - embodiment of a specific weight width or
05:32 - style of a typeface
05:34 - for example
05:36 - the computer file for helvetica bold
05:38 - italic would be a font whereas helvetica
05:41 - would be the typeface
05:43 - next time you're out and about spot some
05:46 - typography you like and take note of
05:48 - what distinguishes it and how it makes
05:50 - you feel in the next video i'll explain
05:53 - how typography relates to the user
05:55 - experience
05:57 - typography makes or breaks a design
06:00 - when done well it elicits emotions and
06:02 - conjures an understanding or connection
06:04 - to a brand equally just as successfully
06:08 - it can slip away unnoticed as it makes
06:10 - reading so easy and pleasurable that the
06:13 - reader doesn't fixate on the letter
06:15 - forms themselves
06:17 - the typography communicates without
06:19 - getting in the way
06:21 - poor typography gives people a lower
06:23 - impression of a brand product or service
06:26 - and even worse it can make an experience
06:29 - difficult or confusing
06:31 - i'll cover three main ways that
06:32 - typography affects the user experience
06:36 - first typography is a major component of
06:39 - branding
06:40 - look at any product you use and observe
06:42 - the typography
06:44 - the company has chosen a typeface that
06:46 - aligns with the brand message
06:48 - it also aligns and differentiates itself
06:51 - from other brands
06:52 - typefaces conjure various connotations
06:55 - that are influenced by culture and
06:57 - cognitive biases and they affect how we
07:00 - feel about the brands
07:02 - second readability is important the
07:05 - shape of letters space between letters
07:08 - space between lines and width of lines
07:10 - all affect a person's ability to easily
07:13 - read text
07:14 - it's so common for us busy humans to
07:17 - quickly scan text instead of reading
07:19 - every word
07:21 - so improving the scan ability of text is
07:24 - something ux designers seek out
07:27 - third let's touch on accessibility
07:29 - accessibility is a core component of
07:32 - product design because it means to make
07:34 - a product or service easy to use
07:37 - designing for accessibility benefits
07:39 - everyone
07:40 - not just those who are differently abled
07:43 - remember that the people who use a
07:45 - product you're designing may have a
07:47 - physical cognitive language or learning
07:50 - disability
07:51 - they may have color blindness low vision
07:54 - or use a screen reader to navigate the
07:55 - web
07:56 - as far as the design goes if you adhere
07:58 - to the best practices of typography your
08:01 - design will naturally be set up to be
08:03 - quite accessible
08:05 - choosing a typeface with distinctive
08:07 - easy to read letters and appropriate
08:09 - contrast then correctly applying heading
08:12 - levels creating clear visual hierarchy
08:15 - maintaining proper alignment and making
08:18 - the text adequately sized will benefit
08:20 - everyone
08:22 - here are a few specific tips
08:24 - people with visual impairments use
08:26 - screen readers which read the text on
08:28 - the screen
08:29 - therefore for non-text-based media such
08:32 - as videos it's advisable to add a way to
08:35 - see the captions or transcripts
08:38 - the same is true for photos which should
08:40 - contain either visual captions or a
08:42 - description implemented with code
08:46 - don't bake text into images
08:48 - add text to websites and apps using
08:50 - markdown such as html so it's accessible
08:53 - to screen readers
08:55 - also text added and markdown can be
08:57 - enlarged whereas raster images get
09:00 - pixelated when enlarged
09:02 - if you must include text and images add
09:04 - the text to the image element with an
09:06 - alt tag when it gets implemented in code
09:10 - when conveying info such as state
09:12 - changes and actions don't rely on just
09:14 - one indicator
09:16 - for example when communicating a status
09:19 - such as a success or error include an
09:21 - additional design change beyond simply
09:24 - color when the design is implemented
09:26 - there are guidelines in place for
09:27 - developing accessible websites
09:30 - if you're interested in the coding
09:31 - details check out the teacher's notes
09:35 - in the upcoming video we'll learn some
09:37 - terms that will help us talk about
09:38 - typography and typefaces
09:41 - now that you understand what typography
09:44 - is let's talk about some of the terms
09:46 - used to describe its different elements
09:49 - this will include typefaces parts of
09:51 - letters layouts and more
09:54 - instead of ambiguously trying to
09:56 - describe something like that low swoopy
09:59 - part of the lowercase y
10:01 - these terms will make it much easier to
10:03 - know what you're talking about as we
10:04 - dive into typography
10:07 - let's look at the numerous elements that
10:09 - shape a typeface
10:10 - first we have the cap height this is
10:13 - simply the height of the capital letters
10:16 - next is the baseline which is pertinent
10:18 - to both the uppercase and lowercase
10:20 - letters as it's the guideline for which
10:22 - the majority of characters rest
10:25 - the height of the lowercase letter set
10:27 - is determined by the lowercase x
10:30 - so this is labeled as the x height
10:33 - the x height varies across typefaces and
10:35 - can greatly affect legibility let's look
10:38 - at that
10:40 - a high x height means the lowercase is
10:42 - larger in relation to the upper case
10:44 - whereas a low x height means the
10:47 - opposite it's smaller
10:49 - when smaller font sizes come into play a
10:52 - typeface with a high x height can help
10:54 - retain legibility because the lowercase
10:56 - is larger in relation to the upper case
11:00 - let's say you have two different
11:01 - typefaces and both are set at 12 point
11:04 - size
11:05 - one could be easier to read than the
11:07 - other due to the higher x height
11:10 - you'll also notice there are certain
11:12 - areas where some lowercase letters
11:14 - descend below the baseline and others
11:17 - ascend above the x height
11:19 - these are called descenders and
11:21 - ascenders respectively
11:23 - the p here has a descender
11:25 - and the d has an ascender you might be
11:28 - wondering how low can descenders go
11:32 - or how high can ascenders climb
11:35 - well that also varies across typefaces
11:38 - in some typefaces ascenders climb up
11:41 - above the cap height and others they sit
11:43 - below
11:44 - and in some cases the cap height and
11:47 - ascenders are aligned this last case
11:50 - though can affect readability and letter
11:52 - recognition
11:54 - for instance let's say you're using
11:56 - helvetica where the cap height and the
11:58 - ascender height are similar
12:01 - you're writing out a headline which
12:02 - includes the word
12:04 - ill
12:06 - the uppercase i
12:07 - and these two lowercase l's are hard to
12:10 - tell apart
12:12 - some might read that as ill but others
12:15 - might read it as the roman numeral three
12:18 - this would be even harder to decipher if
12:20 - the letters appeared mixed up in a
12:22 - coupon code where uppercase lowercase
12:26 - and numbers are present
12:28 - i'm not saying don't use helvetica or
12:31 - typefaces with a similar cap and
12:33 - ascender height
12:34 - i'm saying pay close attention to your
12:36 - ascenders and descenders and know what's
12:39 - at stake
12:41 - let's move on to the next term
12:43 - the typeface we are currently looking at
12:46 - has serifs on it
12:48 - serifs are projections that finish off
12:50 - the main strokes of a letter
12:52 - they can sometimes add legibility and
12:54 - letter recognition
12:57 - for example the problem we just
12:59 - encountered with the ill would not
13:01 - happen here because the serifs are
13:03 - distinctly different on those two
13:05 - letters
13:07 - distinctive character shapes help
13:09 - differentiate letters and serifs help
13:11 - letters flow
13:13 - the shape of letters particularly helps
13:15 - those with dyslexia and reading
13:17 - disabilities
13:19 - other typefaces forego serifs on their
13:22 - letter forms
13:23 - these are called sans serifs sans
13:26 - meaning without
13:28 - next let's talk about contrast
13:31 - contrast can relate to a few different
13:33 - things in typography
13:35 - the first deals with the actual letter
13:37 - forms in a typeface
13:40 - a typeface with high contrast would have
13:42 - thick vertical strokes and then
13:44 - horizontal strokes
13:47 - a typeface with low contrast would have
13:50 - little to no difference in stroke
13:51 - thickness
13:54 - contrast can also refer to the actual
13:57 - text and how it relates to the
13:59 - background
14:01 - pure black text on a pure white
14:03 - background creates high contrast
14:06 - whereas a light gray on a medium gray
14:09 - creates low contrast
14:11 - later we'll look at when creating high
14:14 - or low contrast is appropriate
14:17 - according to the wcag contrast
14:20 - guidelines
14:21 - body text color should have a contrast
14:23 - ratio of at least 4.5 to 1
14:26 - when compared to its background color
14:29 - large text that is 18 points and larger
14:32 - should have a contrast ratio of at least
14:35 - three to one
14:37 - lastly let's discuss color
14:40 - like contrast color can mean a few
14:42 - different things in typography
14:45 - the first is the simplest and is
14:47 - probably what comes to your mind
14:49 - it's the actual color of text such as
14:52 - red
14:53 - blue yellow etc
14:56 - we can create page contrast with changes
14:58 - in color
15:00 - common color blindness conditions
15:03 - include red green and blue yellow
15:07 - people with color blindness have
15:09 - difficulty discerning the differences
15:11 - between the two
15:13 - therefore avoid pairing color text and
15:16 - backgrounds in those colors
15:18 - there are browser plugins and other
15:20 - tools which allow you to test how those
15:22 - with color blindnesses see your design
15:25 - check out the teacher's notes for links
15:28 - the second meaning refers to the overall
15:31 - density of ink or text on a page
15:34 - if we want we can utilize different
15:36 - weights of the typeface at different
15:38 - sizes to create even color on a page
15:42 - we have lighter weights at larger sizes
15:45 - and regular weights at smaller sizes
15:48 - or we can create uneven color by setting
15:51 - our headings to be bolder weights while
15:53 - keeping the paragraphs the same
15:56 - these heavy areas of color can create
15:58 - emphasis if needed
16:01 - when we use this term we'll distinguish
16:03 - its context to avoid confusion
16:06 - there are many other terms used to
16:08 - describe different parts of letter forms
16:10 - and typography
16:12 - if you're hungry for more you can also
16:14 - check out the teachers notes which
16:16 - includes links to a couple of glossaries
16:19 - with what we know now from this video
16:22 - we'll be able to better understand the
16:24 - different types of type in our next
16:26 - video
16:28 - now let's look at the different
16:30 - classifications or types of typefaces
16:33 - you might be wondering why is this
16:36 - important can't i just find something i
16:38 - like and use it
16:40 - well i'm glad you asked
16:42 - knowing different type genres will help
16:44 - you choose a proper typeface for the
16:46 - projects at hand
16:48 - and make you a better designer
16:51 - for instance if you're working with a
16:53 - client who wants the mood of their site
16:55 - to convey eloquence
16:57 - you need to know what classes or styles
16:59 - of typefaces lean towards that bent
17:03 - or if you're designing a site that's
17:05 - heavily influenced by a certain time
17:07 - period you should utilize a typeface
17:09 - that would have been appropriate to
17:11 - genres at that time
17:13 - as i mentioned earlier typefaces have a
17:16 - mood or personality
17:18 - the way their characters look conveys a
17:20 - message to the reader
17:22 - knowing these genres will help us see
17:24 - how our type is talking and what makes
17:27 - it distinct
17:28 - so without further ado let's dive in
17:33 - type has been classified in different
17:35 - ways over the years but for simplicity's
17:38 - sake we'll look at three major genres
17:40 - serif sans serifs and scripts along with
17:44 - their sub-genres
17:46 - up first we'll look at serif typefaces
17:49 - like we learned from our terminology
17:51 - typefaces can have serifs on their
17:53 - letter forms
17:54 - and this would place them in the serif
17:56 - genre
17:58 - simple enough but within this genre we
18:00 - have a number of nuances that will set
18:03 - apart different serifs into sub-genres
18:06 - the sub-genres we'll be covering are
18:09 - humanist old style transitional d-don
18:12 - and
18:14 - after the invention of the printing
18:16 - press in 1450
18:18 - logically the creation of typefaces
18:20 - shortly followed
18:22 - humanist typefaces arose around the
18:24 - 1460s and 1470s with strong calligraphic
18:28 - influence
18:30 - printers were creating typefaces based
18:32 - on the strokes of a pen when drawing
18:33 - letter forms
18:35 - they tend to have diagonal stress
18:37 - lower stroke contrast and a relatively
18:40 - small x height serifs are not as refined
18:44 - these are not as common today but some
18:47 - examples are jensen kennerly and centaur
18:52 - old style came about next in the latter
18:54 - part of the 15th century
18:56 - the letter forms were getting more
18:58 - refined as type and less influenced by
19:01 - calligraphy
19:02 - we see less diagonal stress happening
19:05 - and the serifs have also changed to be
19:07 - more wedge-like
19:09 - some examples include gaudy old style
19:12 - palatino perpetua and plantain
19:16 - this brings us to the 18th century where
19:18 - we see transitional typefaces on the
19:20 - rise
19:21 - the trend of decreasing calligraphic
19:24 - flow continues
19:25 - and here we have vertical stress thinner
19:28 - and flatter serifs along with
19:30 - exaggerated contrast between thicks and
19:32 - thins
19:34 - some examples include baskerville
19:36 - bookmen and clearface itc
19:39 - next we have the done typefaces arriving
19:42 - in the late 18th century
19:45 - the influence of the pen is really
19:47 - nowhere to be found
19:49 - the serifs have become even thinner
19:51 - without any sign of bracketing
19:54 - contrast is taken to the extreme with
19:57 - thick verticals and ultra thin
19:59 - horizontals
20:00 - you might regard these typefaces as
20:02 - reminiscent of the high fashion culture
20:06 - they work great at large sizes with
20:08 - ample amounts of white spaces around
20:10 - them
20:11 - but as body copy at small sizes their
20:14 - serifs and horizontals can quickly get
20:17 - lost
20:18 - some examples include bodhani and dido
20:22 - now we'll head in the opposite direction
20:24 - with slab serifs who have extremely
20:27 - thick slab-like serifs and low contrast
20:31 - these came about in the early 19th
20:34 - century and were heavily used for
20:36 - headlines and advertising because of
20:38 - their bold look at me appearance
20:41 - most of these are utilized at large
20:43 - sizes but a few have been known to also
20:46 - work well in small text sizes
20:49 - some examples of these include rockwell
20:52 - claridin and egypteen
20:55 - next let's move into the new genre of
20:57 - sans serifs
20:59 - these typefaces do not have serifs on
21:01 - their letter forms or literally are
21:04 - without serifs
21:06 - we'll look at grotesque neo-grotesque
21:09 - humanist and geometrics
21:12 - in the late 19th century we see the rise
21:14 - of grotesque sans serifs
21:17 - though we see sans serifs as completely
21:19 - normal today
21:20 - don't forget that there wasn't much of a
21:22 - reference for them when they came about
21:25 - the design of an earlier one axon daw's
21:28 - grotesque has actually been theorized to
21:31 - be derived from didone because the
21:33 - typefaces have similar metrics when the
21:35 - serifs from d'done are removed
21:38 - as we'll see in other genres sans serifs
21:41 - are typically low contrast some examples
21:44 - of grotesque also include franklin
21:46 - gothic
21:48 - the neo-grotas then arises refining some
21:51 - of the peculiarities in early grotesques
21:54 - these are some of the more common
21:56 - sans-serif typefaces and helvetica fits
21:59 - right in there
22:00 - although there is a desire for
22:02 - simplicity here
22:03 - these aren't always great candidates for
22:05 - body copy because of simplicity and
22:08 - similarity in letter forms can often
22:10 - affect legibility at small sizes
22:13 - other examples include univer
22:17 - next we have humanist sands
22:20 - not to be confused with humanist serifs
22:23 - and these get back to some calligraphic
22:25 - roots with greater variations in line
22:28 - widths
22:29 - these are often the most legible of the
22:31 - sans-serif bunch hence their popular use
22:34 - as website body copy
22:37 - so you may be wondering
22:39 - why are they more legible
22:41 - first the modulation of the line
22:44 - thickness creates distinct character
22:46 - shapes
22:46 - this makes it easier to distinguish so
22:49 - it's easier to recognize words
22:52 - second humanist letter forms have wide
22:54 - apertures which for example helps us to
22:58 - avoid confusing a lowercase e as an o
23:02 - examples of humanist serifs include
23:04 - tahoma gill sands and fruity gear
23:08 - next we have our geometrics which are
23:11 - quite popular today
23:13 - as the name implies their letter forms
23:16 - are based on geometric shapes like
23:18 - circles and squares
23:20 - examples include futura bank gothic and
23:24 - gotham
23:25 - now we'll move into our final genre of
23:28 - scripts which are typefaces based on
23:31 - handwriting
23:32 - we'll subset this genre into formal and
23:35 - casual scripts
23:37 - formal scripts are based on letter forms
23:40 - from writing masters in the 17th and
23:42 - 18th centuries
23:44 - they have some contrast between thick
23:46 - and thin as they were inspired by the
23:49 - way a quill or nimble pen would handle
23:51 - the letter forms
23:52 - they tend to be more elegant and work
23:55 - well for events like weddings today
23:58 - casual scripts are a bit freer and well
24:02 - casual
24:03 - they tend to be more lighthearted or
24:05 - easygoing than their serious eloquent
24:07 - counterparts
24:09 - the contrast can range from low to high
24:12 - depending on the typeface
24:14 - they were often inspired by the way a
24:16 - brush or marker would handle the letter
24:18 - forms
24:20 - alright that was a lot to cover
24:22 - i hope it helps you get to know type a
24:24 - little better so we can make smarter
24:26 - choices down the road
24:29 - also think about if there is a certain
24:31 - genre that you naturally gravitate
24:33 - towards
24:34 - in the next video we'll look at
24:36 - designing for print versus digital
24:39 - when laying out or setting type for
24:41 - print the process yields a tangible
24:44 - document such as a piece of paper which
24:46 - has the text as ink on a page
24:49 - this final medium is quite different
24:51 - than a lighted screen displaying a
24:53 - certain amount of pixels to render type
24:55 - on a website
24:57 - now let's look at two main ways web
25:00 - typography differs from print and how we
25:03 - can smartly design with that in mind
25:06 - first let's talk about desktop fonts
25:09 - versus web fonts
25:11 - desktop fonts are used for print layouts
25:13 - and design
25:14 - they are fonts you install on your
25:16 - computer which gives you the ability to
25:18 - use them in word processing programs or
25:20 - design programs
25:22 - the final mediums they can end up on are
25:24 - pages of paper
25:26 - posters billboards jpegs pngs the list
25:30 - goes on
25:32 - desktop fonts were made with those
25:34 - mediums in mind
25:36 - web fonts are font files that are not
25:39 - intended to be used in the same way that
25:40 - desktop fonts are
25:42 - web fonts are created for the purpose of
25:44 - serving up a font on a website or app
25:47 - that might not be installed on a
25:48 - person's computer
25:50 - this is crucial when designing for the
25:52 - web
25:53 - we'll get into where to find web fonts
25:55 - in a bit
25:56 - but for now just know there are several
25:58 - websites that let you download web fonts
26:01 - for free or for purchase
26:04 - in the distant past when creating a
26:06 - website you could only use fonts that
26:09 - were already native to the person's
26:10 - computer
26:12 - also known as system fonts
26:14 - the upside of using system fonts is
26:17 - there's no loading time the fonts are
26:19 - designed for legibility on the devices
26:22 - and users have a familiarity with the
26:24 - font
26:25 - however it limits your choices because
26:27 - you have to use fonts that are native to
26:29 - multiple operating systems on windows
26:32 - and mac
26:33 - now that web fonts are common and well
26:36 - supported you have more control and
26:38 - customization over what your users see
26:41 - when designing for a mobile app the
26:44 - easiest option is to use a system font
26:47 - but if you prefer a custom font look for
26:50 - fonts with an app license
26:52 - this makes it easy to use the font
26:54 - across ios android and other digital
26:57 - publishing platforms
27:00 - when shopping for a web font be sure to
27:03 - inform the client about the ongoing cost
27:06 - some web font licenses are charged based
27:09 - on the number of monthly active users
27:12 - sometimes you'll have a larger budget
27:14 - for web fonts which provides you with
27:16 - some flexibility and options to choose
27:18 - from other times there might not be room
27:21 - in the budget for web font licenses or
27:24 - subscription models
27:26 - if that's the case try to help the
27:28 - client understand the benefits of good
27:30 - typography and why there is a cost
27:33 - associated with web fonts
27:35 - for example i might tell a client free
27:38 - typefaces are fine to use and i will
27:41 - happily go down that route if needed
27:43 - but be aware there's a relatively small
27:46 - number of really good versatile free
27:48 - fonts which limits our options
27:51 - because of that the good ones are often
27:53 - used on many sites
27:56 - which won't do us any favors in
27:58 - distinguishing your site
28:00 - to set your site and brand apart i would
28:02 - recommend going with a subscription web
28:05 - font model
28:06 - although there is some cost i think your
28:08 - brand and users will get much more
28:10 - mileage out of paid web fonts than if we
28:13 - went with free fonts
28:16 - after that sometimes a client makes room
28:18 - in the budget and sometimes they don't
28:21 - in the latter case we'll want to have
28:23 - all these principles we discussed in the
28:25 - back of our minds as we browse free web
28:28 - font sites to find good ones
28:31 - another thing to note about web fonts is
28:33 - this
28:34 - some popular typefaces have desktop
28:36 - licenses but may not yet be available as
28:39 - web fonts
28:41 - in this case you should reach out to the
28:43 - type designer or foundry to see if you
28:45 - can purchase a web font license or find
28:48 - out when one will be released
28:50 - do not try to use a desktop license font
28:53 - and convert it to a web font
28:55 - or serve up desktop font files on your
28:57 - site
28:58 - not only is this not smart but it's also
29:01 - breaking the license agreement for most
29:03 - typefaces
29:06 - lastly let's discuss another difference
29:08 - which is fixed layouts versus fluid
29:10 - layouts
29:12 - in print or graphic design you're
29:14 - designing for a fixed layout meaning the
29:17 - type and elements are arranged in a
29:19 - specific way that's locked into the
29:21 - medium
29:23 - for example if i was laying out a
29:25 - magazine article the type is set in a
29:28 - specific place with an exact width and
29:31 - link to the block of text
29:33 - once that magazine is finalized and
29:35 - printed the type and layout remain that
29:38 - way so you know exactly how the reader
29:40 - is going to see it
29:42 - with the web it's much different
29:45 - users may be viewing your site on a
29:47 - phone tablet or desktop which all have
29:50 - different screen sizes
29:52 - typography that might work great when
29:55 - viewing the site on a desktop computer
29:57 - could take a turn for the worse on a
29:59 - mobile phone
30:01 - with responsive design we can create
30:03 - fluid layouts so that our type and
30:05 - layouts can respond to a user's screen
30:07 - size
30:09 - this gives us a ton of control such as
30:11 - changing font sizes layouts widths and
30:15 - more at certain break points
30:17 - we'll discuss this more later
30:20 - that's it for now and good work
30:21 - finishing this stage
30:23 - i'll see you in the next stage where
30:25 - we'll look at how to choose and use
30:27 - typefaces
30:29 - [Music]
30:33 - with all this talk about fonts you're
30:36 - probably itching to get some new ones of
30:38 - your own
30:39 - you're probably familiar with the
30:40 - standard set of fonts that come on your
30:42 - computer
30:44 - these are called system fonts
30:46 - and android ios windows and mac each
30:49 - have a different selection
30:52 - these are immediately usable on your
30:53 - computer although there is a relatively
30:56 - small selection
30:58 - if you do decide to design with a system
31:01 - font
31:01 - when it's time to develop it with code
31:04 - you can either find a web font that
31:05 - allows everyone to see the font even if
31:08 - they don't have it installed
31:10 - or you can create what's called a font
31:12 - stack in your code
31:14 - it's a list that tells the browser which
31:16 - fonts to use
31:18 - for example
31:19 - you may prefer helvetica which is
31:22 - available on all macs but not all
31:24 - windows computers
31:25 - so you can add arial as a fallback which
31:28 - is available on nearly every windows
31:31 - computer
31:32 - luckily system fonts aren't the only
31:35 - option there are tons of fonts available
31:37 - for download and they're easy to install
31:41 - here's how to install a font
31:44 - find a font foundry or font distributor
31:46 - website
31:48 - then sort by the features you're looking
31:50 - for
31:51 - more on that later
31:52 - when you find the one download and
31:55 - install it on your computer
32:15 - you may notice there is more than one
32:17 - file per font style
32:20 - this can happen if there are different
32:22 - formats
32:24 - here are the common font formats
32:26 - open type truetype
32:29 - eot
32:30 - woof
32:31 - wolf2 and svg
32:34 - files with an otf extension are open
32:37 - type fonts
32:38 - this is the preferred format because it
32:41 - includes the most customization options
32:44 - and has widespread support across
32:46 - platforms
32:48 - files with a ttf extension are true type
32:51 - fonts
32:52 - this is what was used before the open
32:54 - type format while they still work well
32:57 - they don't have the extras that opentype
32:59 - fonts have
33:02 - files with an eot extension use a format
33:04 - created by microsoft they're meant to be
33:07 - used on the web however they only work
33:09 - in internet explorer
33:12 - wolf files are the preferred format for
33:14 - web fonts
33:16 - these files are compressed which means
33:18 - they load faster
33:20 - wolf 2 is a newer iteration of woof the
33:24 - difference is that they're more
33:25 - compressed it's well supported across
33:28 - all the major browsers
33:30 - if you're targeting internet explorer or
33:33 - older browser versions wolfe has the
33:35 - most support
33:37 - svg fonts are not recommended unless
33:40 - you're trying to support very old
33:42 - versions of safari
33:45 - check out the teacher's notes for
33:46 - websites where you can find fonts to
33:48 - download
33:50 - good typography starts with choosing a
33:52 - good typeface
33:54 - no matter how nice graphical elements
33:56 - look on a page a choice of a bad
33:58 - typeface can quickly ruin it
34:01 - when entering into the process of
34:03 - choosing a typeface
34:05 - first ask yourself
34:06 - where will it appear
34:08 - well on the web duh but where on the web
34:12 - what's the context will it be in the
34:14 - navigation or in the paragraphs or in
34:17 - the headlines or all of those
34:21 - answers to these questions will
34:22 - determine if you're looking for a text
34:24 - type face that is engineered for small
34:26 - sizes to a variety of settings
34:29 - or a display typeface which tends to be
34:31 - more flashy and works well at larger
34:33 - sizes
34:34 - these two descriptors deal with the size
34:37 - and function for which a typeface is
34:38 - intended
34:40 - in the next two videos we'll look at how
34:41 - to choose a text typeface and a display
34:44 - typeface
34:46 - it's often smart to choose a text
34:48 - typeface before a display because much
34:51 - of the copy on a site will be set in
34:53 - this choice
34:54 - in his pocket guide on combining
34:56 - typefaces tim brown calls on your anchor
34:59 - typeface because it acts as a reference
35:01 - point for every element in your
35:02 - composition
35:04 - he encourages you to make your body text
35:06 - the anchor if possible
35:09 - so when choosing a text typeface on the
35:11 - web your first priority is legibility
35:15 - if a site's body copy is hard to read
35:17 - then visitors won't stick around for
35:19 - long
35:21 - let's look at a few things to consider
35:22 - in determining if a typeface has good
35:24 - legibility and readability
35:27 - first does the typeface have a good x
35:29 - height
35:30 - an x height that's too low will make the
35:32 - lowercase letters hard to read and tell
35:34 - apart at small sizes
35:36 - an x height can also be too high if it's
35:39 - nearing the cap height making it hard to
35:41 - discern what's uppercase and what's
35:43 - lowercase
35:45 - a general measurement to go by is if the
35:48 - x height is around 60 to 75 percent of
35:51 - the cap height then you've got yourself
35:53 - a good candidate for a text-based
35:56 - next let's consider the white space
35:59 - around the letter forms and its impact
36:01 - on legibility
36:03 - if the space between letters also known
36:05 - as letter spacing
36:07 - is too narrow or too tight then at
36:10 - smaller sizes the letters can get
36:12 - muddled together which hurts legibility
36:16 - looser letter spacing also allows the
36:18 - letter forms to still breathe at small
36:20 - sizes
36:22 - while we do have some control over
36:24 - letter spacing with code it's not
36:26 - advisable to manually letter space body
36:28 - text find a typeface that already has
36:31 - proper looser letter spacing for text
36:36 - next you will want to make sure the
36:38 - typeface has overall even color as it
36:41 - balances the positive space of
36:42 - characters and the negative space of
36:44 - white space
36:46 - you wouldn't want your text to feel too
36:48 - dense in certain areas or characters
36:50 - which can break the reading flow
36:53 - a trick you can employ is to blur your
36:55 - eyes as you're looking at the typeface
36:57 - we'll manually mimic that here
37:00 - do any dark splashes or uneven places of
37:02 - color show up
37:04 - if so you probably want to mark that one
37:06 - off the list
37:08 - avenir next looks quite even though
37:12 - other areas that deal with white space
37:14 - are counters
37:15 - a counter is the fully or partially
37:17 - closed white space inside letter forms
37:19 - like o b or e large or open counters can
37:24 - also aid legibility because they are
37:26 - less prone to close up at smaller sizes
37:30 - let's look at nutraface tube by house
37:32 - industries as an example on x height and
37:35 - white space
37:37 - this family comes with a text and a
37:39 - display version
37:41 - both of them here are set at the same
37:43 - point size
37:45 - but we can immediately notice some
37:47 - differences
37:49 - though the cap heights are similar the
37:51 - text version has a higher x height which
37:53 - helps retain legibility at smaller sizes
37:57 - the letter spacing is looser in the text
37:59 - version than in the display version
38:02 - giving the characters encounters more
38:04 - room to breathe
38:06 - although the display face wouldn't work
38:07 - well at small sizes
38:09 - its lower x height and tighter letter
38:12 - spacing helps greater amounts of text
38:14 - fit into tighter spaces
38:17 - a trait that's beneficial for headlines
38:21 - next you want to think about the mood of
38:22 - the typeface matching the content at
38:24 - hand
38:25 - familiarize yourself with the content by
38:28 - taking the time to read it thoroughly
38:30 - then write down some ways to describe it
38:33 - in your own words is it serious
38:36 - light-hearted witty
38:38 - pointed
38:39 - classy
38:41 - as you peruse typefaces have these words
38:43 - in the back of your mind and see if a
38:46 - typeface speaks in that certain mood
38:48 - consider who your audience is and what
38:51 - kinds of styles of typefaces they might
38:53 - be accustomed to
38:54 - are they doctors lawyers kids
38:57 - are there certain genres that the target
39:00 - industry is known for
39:02 - you might not want to choose something
39:03 - that's been overused but you can still
39:05 - plan to these norms and create
39:07 - familiarity or untrust by choosing a
39:10 - proper type base that speaks in the
39:12 - right mood
39:14 - with text faces it should be noted that
39:16 - mood can be conveyed with the slightest
39:18 - subtleties in the letter forms
39:20 - a simple change in the way a serif is
39:22 - handled can mean the world of a
39:24 - difference in text because there's a lot
39:26 - of it on the page
39:28 - don't go for something that's overly
39:30 - ornate or has a lot of character
39:33 - as it'll have too much going on for body
39:36 - copy
39:37 - in any case the mood of the typeface
39:40 - should fit the content at hand but don't
39:42 - sacrifice legibility just because you
39:44 - like the mood of another typeface better
39:48 - don't forget to make sure the typeface
39:50 - has everything you need
39:52 - you would hate to get halfway through
39:53 - designing a layout and realize the font
39:56 - doesn't contain a certain character or
39:58 - symbol that's needed
40:00 - things to consider are
40:02 - does the typeface have a range of
40:04 - weights
40:05 - does the typeface have italic styles
40:08 - well we need different widths for
40:10 - versatility
40:12 - are small caps necessary
40:14 - what accented characters are included
40:16 - for language support
40:19 - and what kinds of numerical figures are
40:21 - needed
40:22 - to clarify that last note there are a
40:25 - few different styles of numerical
40:26 - figures we'll look at old style and
40:29 - lining figures
40:31 - old style figures vary in height and
40:34 - descend below the baseline at times
40:37 - these are nice for text and body copy as
40:39 - they flow well with the rhythm set by
40:41 - the text
40:42 - and they're necessary when using small
40:44 - caps
40:45 - lining figures all have the same height
40:48 - and baseline and are generally good for
40:51 - display headlines or setting with
40:53 - uppercase only
40:56 - that concludes how to choose a text
40:58 - typeface
40:59 - sometimes designers utilize a versatile
41:02 - text family that works for both small
41:04 - and large text sizes
41:07 - other times a single typeface won't work
41:09 - for all text sizes because weird
41:11 - intricacies can appear in the letter
41:13 - forms at different sizes
41:16 - also you might just want to have some
41:18 - variety with your type so in the next
41:20 - video we'll look at how to choose a
41:22 - display typeface
41:25 - for further study on choosing a typeface
41:27 - there's some great articles and
41:29 - resources in the teachers notes that
41:31 - influence what we discussed here and i
41:34 - highly recommend taking some time to
41:36 - read them
41:38 - now that we understand how to anchor our
41:40 - content with a text typeface
41:42 - let's see how to go about choosing a
41:44 - display face for the web
41:47 - as we saw earlier display typefaces are
41:49 - meant for larger sizes like big
41:51 - headlines site titles or pull quotes
41:55 - this allows for a bit more expressive
41:57 - and creative opportunities with letter
41:58 - forms
42:00 - nice intricacies like thin serifs would
42:03 - be lost at small point sizes but here
42:06 - they can shine
42:08 - big bold condensed decks with narrow
42:10 - counters would close up at body text
42:13 - sizes but here you can soak them all in
42:17 - a nice casual sign painter script would
42:20 - hardly be legible in paragraphs but here
42:23 - it can flow beautifully as a heading
42:26 - so how should we go about choosing one
42:30 - first make sure it's legible and
42:32 - readable
42:33 - just because the type is bigger doesn't
42:35 - mean that every character of a typeface
42:38 - will be legible
42:39 - if a person can't read a headline or a
42:42 - title then the message hasn't been
42:44 - enhanced by good typography it's been
42:46 - lost by bad typography
42:49 - although there's much more room for
42:51 - expression with display type
42:53 - make sure you're choosing a
42:54 - well-designed legible typeface
42:57 - just because something looks cool in a
42:59 - specimen image doesn't mean it'll be
43:01 - usable
43:03 - make use of the tests we talked about by
43:05 - blurring your eyes to see if a typeface
43:07 - has an even overall color in all of its
43:09 - characters
43:11 - most font sites include a type tester
43:13 - with their typefaces
43:15 - write out example headlines to make sure
43:18 - it's evenly spaced and see what sizes it
43:21 - works best at
43:22 - display type should have a bit tighter
43:24 - spacing than text typefaces
43:27 - other things that can help readability
43:29 - and display faces are short ascenders
43:32 - and descenders
43:34 - in the setting of headlines these
43:36 - features help reduce choppiness in the
43:38 - text
43:40 - again one of the big questions we'll
43:42 - want to ask is does the mood of the
43:44 - typeface fit the content
43:46 - for text faces we talked about
43:48 - channeling the mood with subtle nuances
43:50 - in typefaces
43:51 - with display we have a bit more room for
43:54 - expressiveness in the mood
43:56 - we can use the words we came up with
43:58 - throughout our content exercise in the
44:00 - previous video and apply them to our
44:03 - search for a display face that fits the
44:05 - right mood
44:06 - if you're creating a site that's set
44:08 - around a certain time period
44:10 - look for typefaces that are true to that
44:12 - period
44:14 - that will take some research but instead
44:16 - of choosing the mood we think the period
44:18 - should look like
44:19 - we'll be truly conveying what it was
44:21 - like
44:23 - jessica hish has some great thoughts on
44:25 - this which are linked to in the teachers
44:27 - notes
44:29 - next we'll again want to think about who
44:31 - are our readers or users
44:34 - if we're creating a site for people in a
44:36 - specific industry let's say web
44:38 - developers
44:40 - then that affects how we choose a
44:41 - typeface
44:43 - take for instance this example of how to
44:46 - play into the typographic styles people
44:48 - in the web design industry aren't
44:50 - accustomed to
44:51 - let's say we want to display snippets of
44:53 - example code in a blog post
44:56 - coding programs like atom or sublime
44:59 - text are used by web developers and
45:01 - default to monospace typefaces
45:04 - these are fonts originally created for
45:07 - typewriters whose characters all occupy
45:09 - the same amount of horizontal space
45:12 - they're great for code since it's easier
45:14 - to distinguish symbols and layout
45:17 - tabular data in plain text
45:20 - but they wouldn't be a great choice for
45:21 - body text due to decreased legibility
45:24 - and long paragraphs
45:26 - we can still play into that industry
45:28 - norm with our code snippets though
45:31 - by utilizing a mono-spaced font we can
45:34 - typographically make the snippet appear
45:36 - as it would in an actual code
45:38 - environment
45:40 - so take into account who your readers
45:43 - are and what styles of typefaces might
45:45 - be the right fit for their industry
45:48 - i won't fully go into the other
45:50 - priorities again as they were covered in
45:52 - the previous video
45:54 - but similarly to text typefaces take
45:57 - into account the budget and make sure a
45:59 - display face has everything you need in
46:02 - regards to weights styles or accents
46:06 - because display typefaces are used in
46:08 - fewer contacts there's a bit more
46:11 - flexibility here
46:13 - though you'd never want to set body text
46:15 - in all caps you can actually utilize a
46:18 - display face to great effect that only
46:20 - has uppercase characters
46:23 - also it's possible to have good
46:25 - typography with a single weighted font
46:28 - for your display face
46:30 - these situations might not be ideal but
46:33 - they can be worked through
46:35 - lastly there might be a scenario where
46:37 - you land a client who already has a
46:39 - typeface for their brands
46:42 - this process then is sometimes as simple
46:45 - as finding the webfont version of that
46:47 - typeface
46:48 - but other times there might not be web
46:50 - font licenses available for it yet
46:53 - in that case you want to find a typeface
46:56 - that channels a similar mood and style
46:58 - to the print version as you translate
47:01 - their brand for the web
47:03 - you could google alternative to
47:06 - insert typeface here
47:08 - but what's the fun in that
47:10 - utilize all the knowledge you've taken
47:13 - here to make a well-informed decision
47:15 - for an alternative that best spends the
47:17 - client
47:18 - you might arrive at a different
47:19 - conclusion than those online forums
47:23 - later on in the course we'll get into
47:25 - more details on how to pair typefaces
47:28 - but i hope this has helped distill some
47:31 - of the ambiguity around choosing a
47:33 - typeface for the web
47:35 - think about where it's going to live
47:37 - what makes it legible if it's mood
47:39 - matches the content and audience
47:42 - does it have everything you need and
47:44 - what factor will cosplay
47:47 - this is by no means an exact science so
47:51 - have some fun along the way
47:53 - the answers to these questions should
47:55 - help guide you in a good direction and
47:58 - leave room for your own personal taste
48:00 - and design choices
48:03 - next we'll take a look at weights styles
48:06 - and sizes
48:08 - [Music]
48:13 - now that we've looked at some principles
48:14 - and have a background in typography
48:17 - we'll get into how to practically
48:18 - achieve good typography on the web in
48:21 - the next few stages
48:23 - in the previous stage we learned how to
48:25 - choose fonts
48:27 - in this session we'll start with the
48:29 - basics of a font family's weights and
48:31 - styles like bold and italics
48:34 - first it'll be good to mention here that
48:37 - faux bold and faux italic are faux pas
48:40 - which simply translates to
48:42 - don't do them
48:44 - faux bold or faux italic means it is a
48:47 - false bold or fake italic
48:50 - these can occur when you only have one
48:52 - weight and style of a typeface
48:54 - design programs in css have the ability
48:58 - to fake the bold or italic style of that
49:00 - web font but believe me it ain't pretty
49:03 - and it can hinder legibility
49:06 - a faux bold is created by thickening up
49:08 - the original font
49:10 - this can create issues with legibility
49:12 - as counters close up dark patches of
49:15 - color can appear
49:16 - and letters get distorted
49:19 - type designers carefully craft their
49:21 - bold weights to correct these issues
49:24 - faux italic text is created by obliquing
49:26 - or slanting the original font to a
49:28 - certain degree at first glance you might
49:31 - think this looks okay but let's take a
49:34 - closer look
49:35 - italic versions of serif typefaces are
49:38 - actually created in a more cursive style
49:41 - they're not just slanted versions of
49:43 - their regular or roman counterparts
49:46 - their condensed sum and often their
49:48 - letter forms are entirely different
49:50 - altogether
49:52 - notice the changes here such as how the
49:54 - crossbar on the e becomes more fluid or
49:57 - how the f elegantly descends below the
50:00 - baseline
50:01 - because italics are often used for
50:03 - emphasis on the web
50:05 - true italics can better emphasize words
50:08 - or phrases than faux italics because of
50:10 - this
50:11 - for sans serifs this curse of nature is
50:14 - less accentuated
50:16 - so you might think that you can get away
50:18 - with the foe but you can't
50:21 - any time you oblique the font
50:23 - the weight of the letter forms gets
50:25 - unevenly distributed which creates
50:27 - uneven color
50:29 - also
50:30 - certain letters can change entirely in a
50:33 - true italic
50:34 - such as a two-story roman a
50:36 - changing to a one-story italic a again
50:40 - type designers meticulously build italic
50:44 - versions of their fonts correcting these
50:46 - issues
50:47 - so be sure to utilize fonts that have
50:49 - bold and italics instead of trying to
50:51 - fake it
50:53 - this not only gives the user a better
50:55 - experience but it also improves the
50:57 - legibility and readability
51:00 - be aware too that some typefaces online
51:02 - are sold as having italics
51:04 - but really they're just uncorrected
51:07 - oblique versions of their fonts
51:10 - this is why when we discussed using a
51:12 - typeface you'll want to make sure it's
51:14 - well built with all the necessary
51:16 - weights and styles
51:18 - let's unpack that
51:20 - sometimes typefaces have a basic array
51:22 - of weights like normal and bold but
51:26 - other times a family of fawns can range
51:28 - from thin to light to normal to
51:31 - semi-bold to bold to black
51:35 - let's look at the different weights of
51:36 - open sands using figma
51:39 - as you can see there's light light
51:42 - italic regular italic and so on
51:46 - some fonts have additional styles such
51:48 - as hairline which is even thinner than
51:50 - thin
51:52 - an ultra which is even thicker than
51:54 - extra bold or black for this entire text
51:57 - block the family name is said as open
52:00 - sans
52:01 - but the text within is a different
52:04 - weight and or style
52:06 - click into the text to see what it's set
52:08 - to
52:09 - if you see a message about missing fonts
52:12 - download all the styles of open sans
52:14 - from google fonts
52:16 - figma just has a few styles
52:17 - pre-installed
52:20 - in addition to those settings we can
52:22 - also make the text underlined
52:29 - we can format it in all caps this is
52:32 - preferable to typing it in all uppercase
52:34 - letters it's much easier to switch back
52:37 - to title case if you decide to change it
52:39 - later
52:43 - we can also format it in small caps but
52:46 - only if the font supports it
52:49 - we see here that open sans doesn't
52:51 - support small caps
52:54 - let's see it in playfair a google font
52:56 - that supports small caps
53:06 - be careful to not choose four small caps
53:09 - as we want the true small caps designed
53:12 - by the type designer
53:15 - great now you've gotten a handle on the
53:18 - basic formatting options
53:20 - next i'll introduce you to the design
53:22 - project we'll work on in this course
53:24 - as i introduce concepts i'll demo it in
53:27 - a design program called figma
53:29 - to follow along download the project
53:32 - files
53:33 - here we see copy from the science
53:35 - fiction book the war of the worlds
53:38 - i've also added some headings
53:41 - the text is set in alegria from google
53:44 - fonts
53:45 - i chose this typeface because of its
53:47 - roots and literature due to the
53:48 - continent hand being a book its diverse
53:51 - weights italics and the inclusion of
53:54 - small caps and other features
53:56 - we'll use this file to play around with
53:58 - type
53:59 - as you can see
54:00 - all the text is the same size which
54:03 - really flattens the hierarchy
54:06 - i can make the headings bold to stand
54:08 - out
54:09 - but there's even more we can do
54:12 - let's talk about text size
54:15 - when designing for screens in a design
54:17 - program you'll specify text in pixels
54:20 - a pixel is a fixed unit of measure that
54:22 - pertains to media with display screens
54:25 - such as a computer
54:27 - a good rule of thumb is to set your body
54:29 - text anywhere relative to 16 pixels to
54:32 - 24 pixels
54:34 - reader's eyes are usually a few feet
54:36 - away from the screen so these larger
54:39 - sizes are necessary for comfortable
54:41 - reading
54:42 - whereas smaller attacks can strain and
54:44 - tire their eyes
54:46 - this range is diverse too as every
54:49 - typeface is different
54:51 - as we've seen before the x height of a
54:53 - typeface can greatly affect its
54:56 - perceived size
54:57 - so use what you've learned and make a
54:59 - judgment call on what works best
55:02 - when in doubt lean towards the larger
55:04 - size to be safe
55:06 - as the design gets implemented with code
55:09 - the text size will likely translate to a
55:11 - non-fixed unit
55:13 - while pixels make it easy to create
55:15 - exact designs with a fixed unit
55:18 - designs are viewed on a broad range of
55:20 - devices out in the wild
55:22 - but because this is a fixed unit of
55:25 - measure it can create more work with
55:27 - responsive typography which scales text
55:30 - size up or down depending on the
55:32 - screen's size
55:34 - so
55:35 - pixels should be swapped out with
55:37 - responsive units like m's and rims which
55:40 - are relative units for font sizing
55:43 - this is incredibly helpful scalable and
55:46 - powerful for responsive typography
55:49 - but no need to act on that now
55:52 - we'll work in pixels as we design and if
55:54 - you decide to develop with code you can
55:57 - do so with relative units and minds
56:00 - once you've set your body text size it's
56:02 - time to adjust the rest of the text
56:05 - sizing your headings paragraphs and
56:07 - other text elements may seem a little
56:10 - tricky and it's not a great idea to just
56:13 - guess by shooting in the dark
56:15 - this can lead to inconsistent headings
56:18 - and paragraph sizes
56:20 - which is why following a typographic
56:22 - scale can help immensely
56:24 - a scale gradually increases at a certain
56:27 - rate to ensure consistent proportions
56:29 - for your font sizes
56:32 - the classic typographic scale increases
56:35 - in intervals of 1 2 3 and then 12.
56:39 - it's been used for centuries and is
56:41 - reliable to adhere to
56:43 - especially if you're using 16 pixels as
56:46 - your base size
56:48 - 16 pixels is great
56:50 - but i'd like to enlarge the body copy to
56:52 - 20 pixels
56:54 - that size is not in the classic scale
56:57 - but don't fret
56:59 - i'll look at typescale.com to build a
57:01 - typescale
57:02 - this site is incredibly helpful because
57:05 - you can set your base size test
57:07 - different scales and even import google
57:09 - web
57:10 - fonts our base size is 20 pixels
57:14 - let's choose the major third as i like
57:16 - its sizing
57:17 - and we can change the font family to
57:19 - alegria
57:21 - feel free to test out the different
57:23 - scales to see what they look like
57:25 - the perfect fourth and fifth are also
57:27 - commonly used
57:29 - we're now given some sizes in m's and
57:32 - pixels
57:33 - focus on pixels for now
57:35 - ms are important when it comes to
57:37 - implementing it code
57:39 - now let's set the font size for the
57:41 - headings
57:42 - here's the order of the headings by text
57:44 - size
57:45 - title paragraph headings and author name
57:49 - for simplicity i'll round down to the
57:51 - nearest pixel
57:53 - also note that you don't need to use the
57:55 - largest text size you can start and stop
57:59 - anywhere within the scale
58:01 - so long as you choose adjacent sizes
58:04 - the largest heading will be our h1 or
58:06 - heading 1 at 48 pixels
58:10 - the next will be our h2 at 39 pixels
58:13 - and the third will be our h3 at 31
58:16 - pixels
58:18 - then i'll set the body text to 20 pixels
58:25 - i'll go ahead and create a text style
58:27 - for each heading
58:28 - this sets us up for quick edits later on
58:31 - and it keeps the text sizes consistent
58:53 - great now that's set up
58:55 - we still have a ways to go but getting a
58:58 - proper body size and scale is a great
59:00 - place to start
59:02 - once we get a good size for our body
59:04 - text we'll want to take a look at our
59:06 - measure and space
59:08 - we first talk about measure which is
59:10 - also known as line length because it
59:12 - deals with how many characters fit on
59:14 - each line of text
59:16 - then we'll discuss the space between
59:19 - letters
59:20 - these two concepts both work together to
59:22 - create readable layouts which give the
59:25 - type room to brief
59:28 - in elements of typographic style robert
59:31 - bringhurst recommends a measure of 45 to
59:34 - 75 characters per line for a single
59:37 - column of text
59:39 - a measure that's too long can tire out
59:41 - reader's eyes as they have to travel far
59:44 - across the screen and back multiple
59:46 - times
59:48 - when shifting to the next line below
59:50 - they can potentially lose their place
59:53 - a measure that's too short will have
59:55 - readers eyes quickly jumping back and
59:57 - forth to the next line
59:59 - which is again
60:00 - quite exhausting and jarring
60:03 - a measure that's just right will be
60:05 - comfortable to the user creating an
60:07 - enjoyable reading experience
60:10 - remember 45 to 75 characters works well
60:14 - with the mid 60s being ideal
60:17 - if you're working with multiple columns
60:19 - you can shoot for the 40 to 50 character
60:22 - range
60:23 - in our figma file our layout currently
60:26 - isn't very readable the lines of text
60:28 - span the whole page and the measure is
60:31 - well above what's recommended
60:34 - i've placed bold asterisks at the 45th
60:37 - and 75th characters
60:39 - we can remove this later but this guides
60:41 - us and gives us a good idea about where
60:43 - our line should break
60:45 - to determine character counts check out
60:47 - the teacher's notes for a tool
60:57 - if these two asterisks end up on the
60:59 - same line then we know we need to fix
61:02 - our measure
61:03 - now let's determine a good width for
61:05 - this text
61:07 - a good place to start is to multiply
61:09 - your body font size by 30. since the
61:12 - body font size is 20 pixels we could set
61:15 - a max width of 600 pixels
61:18 - the asterisks fall on two different
61:19 - lines which is what we want and the text
61:22 - width feels appropriate
61:24 - always take time to read through a few
61:26 - paragraphs to make sure the measure
61:28 - feels appropriate or needs adjusting
61:32 - although commonly confused tracking and
61:35 - kerning are two different techniques
61:37 - when it comes to typography
61:39 - they both deal with the space around the
61:41 - letter forms but in different ways
61:45 - we'll examine each one along with
61:47 - general rules of thumb for both
61:50 - tracking also known as letter spacing
61:53 - pertains to the amount of space between
61:55 - every character in a particular block of
61:57 - text
61:58 - you could increase or decrease the
62:00 - amount of tracking which will affect the
62:02 - text as a whole
62:05 - tighter tracking will result in a
62:06 - heavier feel
62:08 - whereas looser tracking gives it a
62:10 - lighter airier look
62:14 - for example let's set the title in all
62:17 - caps to make a bold statement
62:19 - now we'll want to tweak the tracking to
62:21 - make it easier to read
62:23 - we can set the tracking in our main
62:25 - title to be greater or less than the
62:27 - font's normal spacing
62:29 - let's add 3 percent to the heading 1
62:31 - style
62:35 - notice how every space between every
62:38 - character is affected as it loosened up
62:41 - now let's change the value to a negative
62:44 - value of negative 3 which will track it
62:47 - inward
62:50 - looks good
62:51 - notice how this also affects how heavy
62:54 - the element feels on the page
62:56 - tighter letter spacing will result in
62:58 - heavier feel
63:00 - whereas looser letter spacing gives it a
63:02 - lighter airier look
63:05 - general rules of thumb are
63:07 - slightly reduce the tracking and
63:09 - headings by three to five percent
63:11 - as type gets bigger the tracking
63:13 - increases
63:15 - sometimes in headings it appears too
63:17 - spaced out
63:19 - tightening the heading to be more
63:20 - compact makes it more solid and more
63:23 - closely resemble the spacing of body
63:25 - type
63:26 - this is also commonly done to logo types
63:29 - do not change the tracking and body copy
63:32 - unless it's absolutely necessary to aid
63:34 - legibility
63:36 - don't track your type out too much as
63:38 - words and spaces will get muddled
63:42 - increase tracking in small caps or
63:44 - uppercase texts by five to ten percent
63:48 - this generally applies to uppercase
63:50 - headlines acronyms and long series of
63:53 - digits
63:54 - if your design program gives you the
63:56 - option of metric or optical tracking
63:59 - choose metric which uses character
64:01 - spacing information inside the font
64:04 - this is valuable information the font
64:06 - designer included
64:09 - optical spacing throws out that
64:11 - carefully crafted information and
64:13 - instead uses an algorithm that tries to
64:16 - guess the kerning of every character and
64:18 - often gets it wrong
64:21 - now let's look at kerning
64:23 - kerning deals with the amount of space
64:25 - between a specific character combination
64:27 - rather than the spacing of a whole body
64:29 - of text
64:31 - in a typeface a type designer sets the
64:33 - space for the left side of a letter and
64:35 - the right side of the letter so that it
64:38 - works best with all the other letters
64:40 - and their spacing
64:42 - certain character combinations can come
64:44 - up that are either too far apart or too
64:47 - close together
64:49 - such as uppercase av
64:52 - uppercase wa
64:55 - or uppercase t lowercase a
64:58 - with kerning character pairs are
65:00 - adjusted to be evenly spaced with the
65:03 - rest of the typeface
65:05 - generally you wouldn't need to adjust
65:07 - kerning if you have a well-designed font
65:10 - if you find off-balance letters you can
65:12 - manually adjust the kerning but if you
65:15 - find a lot then consider switching to a
65:17 - more balanced font
65:19 - so letter spacing affects the spacing of
65:21 - the text as a whole
65:23 - whereas kerning deals with the space
65:25 - between a specific pair of letters
65:27 - now let's move into talking about
65:30 - ligatures
65:31 - ligatures improve the appearance of text
65:33 - for letters that are too close together
65:36 - like the f and the i
65:38 - they create a smoother transition
65:40 - between letters by connecting certain
65:42 - character combinations
65:44 - they can also give the text a nice touch
65:47 - ligatures are mostly found in serif and
65:50 - script typefaces because they aren't as
65:52 - necessary in sans serifs
65:55 - so
65:55 - just because a typeface does not have
65:58 - them does not mean it's a bad typeface
66:01 - in order to utilize ligatures you'll
66:04 - need a typeface that supports them
66:06 - typeface specimen images will often
66:09 - showcase them
66:10 - or you can look through the character
66:12 - map on a typeface to see if they're
66:14 - available
66:15 - here i'm viewing brandontax font on
66:17 - myfonts.com
66:19 - under open type features i see it has
66:21 - ligatures
66:29 - to see it in action i can type the word
66:32 - figs
66:36 - see how the f and i letters combine
66:40 - the type designer decided to hide the
66:42 - dot of the eye when it follows a
66:44 - lowercase f
66:45 - this helps legibility and simplifies the
66:48 - text
66:50 - that's it for horizontal space
66:52 - stick around for the next video where
66:54 - we'll delve into vertical space
66:58 - now let's address the vertical space in
67:00 - our design by adjusting our line heights
67:03 - and looking at vertical rhythm
67:05 - leading also referred to as line height
67:08 - or line spacing deals with the vertical
67:10 - space between consecutive lines of text
67:13 - you might be familiar with it as single
67:16 - or double spacing and document editors
67:18 - like word
67:20 - for reference i've seen well-built
67:22 - typographic sites utilize line heights
67:24 - ranging from 135 percent to 185 percent
67:28 - for body text
67:30 - every typeface is different so line
67:32 - heights can vary 150 tends to be a good
67:36 - starting place and is commonly used
67:39 - figure out a good comfortable leading
67:41 - for your body copy first because it will
67:43 - be paramount to establishing vertical
67:45 - rhythm
67:47 - i'll use a hundred and sixty percent for
67:49 - the body text
67:54 - before we get into rhythm let's take a
67:57 - look at our headings i'll add a bit more
67:59 - text to make them break to the next line
68:01 - so we can set their line height
68:08 - a general rule of thumb is as heading
68:10 - sizes increase your line height should
68:12 - decrease
68:14 - the line height that worked for the body
68:16 - would most likely be too spacious for
68:18 - your bigger headings
68:20 - here i'm setting our heading 1 at 110
68:23 - percent are heading two at 120 percent
68:26 - and are heading three at 130 percent
68:30 - different font sizes and families
68:32 - require different values so be sure to
68:34 - test what works best
68:37 - great
68:38 - now that those are adjusted we can look
68:40 - at our vertical rhythm
68:42 - the space between paragraphs is decent
68:45 - however there's more we can do with
68:46 - grids we'll get into that shortly
68:49 - the spacing between lines of text
68:51 - creates a rhythm that can balance a
68:53 - layout and enhance readability
68:56 - when we read we recognize patterns
68:58 - if a layout has a consistent line and
69:01 - paragraph spacing we develop pattern
69:04 - recognition after reading a few lines of
69:06 - text
69:07 - this will help us identify other
69:09 - identical spaces as part of the same
69:11 - pattern
69:12 - an unbalanced rhythm can disorient the
69:15 - reader
69:17 - vertical rhythm balances the spacing and
69:19 - arrangement of text as the user reads
69:22 - down the page
69:24 - every bit of text has a baseline it sits
69:26 - on
69:27 - if each line of text sits on the
69:29 - rhythmic baseline then you can say that
69:31 - it has consistent vertical balance or
69:33 - rhythm
69:35 - the concept of vertical rhythm applies
69:38 - first and foremost to paragraph text
69:41 - you can also utilize headings
69:43 - subheadings or images to flow in sync
69:46 - with your rhythm
69:47 - but it's often hard to perfectly execute
69:50 - unless a site's content is static
69:53 - robert bringhurst writes that
69:55 - headings subheads block quotations
69:58 - footnotes illustrations captions and
70:01 - other intrusions into the text create
70:03 - syncopations and variations against the
70:06 - base rhythm of regularly leaded lines
70:09 - these variations can and should add life
70:12 - to the page
70:13 - but the main text should also return
70:16 - after each variation precisely on beat
70:19 - and in phase
70:21 - that means it's okay if a heading or
70:23 - image breaks rhythm a bit
70:25 - but most important is your paragraph
70:28 - text returning to its rhythm after that
70:30 - element is introduced
70:32 - this offers consistent predictable line
70:35 - spacing as the reader scrolls through
70:37 - the content
70:39 - next we'll create a consistent rhythm
70:41 - using a baseline grid grids create a
70:44 - system for arranging content on a screen
70:48 - this results in layouts with an inherent
70:50 - rhythm
70:52 - when space is divided into boxes
70:54 - content can be contained in the rows and
70:57 - columns or spread to fill multiple rows
71:00 - and columns
71:01 - there's a long history of grid systems
71:04 - in graphic design
71:05 - and we see them in web and app design as
71:07 - well
71:08 - designing for the web often involves
71:11 - creating a design that will work across
71:13 - multiple devices
71:15 - as such while a website may allow for a
71:18 - multi-column design on a larger screen
71:20 - size such as a desktop
71:22 - the same website on a smartphone may
71:25 - render as a single column so it's easier
71:28 - to read within a limited space
71:30 - baseline grids divide the artboard in
71:33 - relation to the elements on the page
71:37 - we'll start by using layout grid and
71:39 - figma
71:40 - first select the frame
71:43 - now you'll see the layout grid module
71:45 - appear
71:46 - there are three different forms of grids
71:48 - to choose from
71:49 - grid column and row
71:51 - let's choose grid which is a uniform
71:54 - grid that includes columns and rows
71:57 - the size refers to how many pixels apart
72:00 - each baseline is
72:02 - this should correspond to the line
72:03 - height of our body text
72:05 - as mentioned before our line height is
72:08 - 160
72:09 - and the text size is 20 pixels
72:12 - this means the line height comes out to
72:14 - be 32 pixels
72:17 - so
72:18 - that's what we'll want to set our
72:19 - baseline to
72:20 - notice how the lines of text are not
72:22 - sitting on the baseline but rather in
72:24 - between them and they're not
72:26 - consistently in the same place
72:28 - this is what we call poor rhythm let's
72:31 - change that
72:33 - to start let's get our title aligned
72:36 - next we need to adjust the rest of the
72:38 - text
72:40 - we're able to add 30 pixels of spacing
72:43 - in between paragraphs
72:45 - but that's the limit to the control we
72:47 - have if we keep all of this text in one
72:49 - text box
72:51 - so
72:52 - let's break these pieces out into their
72:54 - own text boxes for more control
72:57 - i've done that in this next artboard
73:03 - now we can align them to the grid
73:06 - just align them to the horizontal lines
73:08 - and don't worry about the vertical lines
73:11 - where the planet mars section starts
73:13 - notice how i skip two rows of spacing to
73:16 - give it extra vertical spacing
73:18 - this makes it clear a new section is
73:20 - starting and keeps the headline close to
73:22 - its corresponding intro paragraph if i
73:25 - had left one row before and after the
73:27 - heading i'd run into a ux issue called
73:30 - floating heading
73:32 - this occurs when the vertical spacing
73:34 - above and below a heading makes it
73:36 - difficult to tell which heading belongs
73:38 - to which series of paragraphs
73:41 - alright great we see our rhythm stays
73:43 - intact and we can easily notice where
73:45 - another paragraph starts
73:47 - a text indent is not necessary for
73:50 - leading paragraphs because their start
73:52 - already is noticeable
73:55 - let's take the baseline grid away to get
73:57 - a final look
73:59 - this page has much better rhythm now
74:02 - keep in mind if we were to change any
74:04 - font sizes line heights or margins that
74:08 - will affect vertical rhythm
74:10 - grids are a tool to help us make good
74:12 - design choices but it isn't fail proof
74:16 - something could be perfectly lined up to
74:18 - a baseline but that doesn't mean it
74:20 - feels right
74:21 - go with what feels right
74:23 - this does take some tinkering but don't
74:25 - lose sight of the forest for the trees
74:28 - keep in mind your first priority is
74:30 - making sure your body's rhythm works
74:32 - well with its line height and paragraph
74:34 - structure
74:36 - and as a final note break the grid when
74:39 - necessary this makes a bold statement
74:42 - and is a technique for making an element
74:44 - stand out have fun with it
74:48 - now that you have experience using a
74:50 - baseline grid let's delve deeper into
74:52 - setting paragraphs
74:54 - there are two main options
74:56 - for option one you can simply use an
74:58 - empty line to add space between the
75:00 - paragraphs
75:02 - that's how it is in our project right
75:03 - now
75:05 - as for option two you can indent the
75:07 - first line
75:08 - let's look at some pointers
75:10 - the recommended amount of indentation is
75:12 - 1m
75:13 - or in other words the base size of the
75:16 - body text
75:18 - and now for some don'ts
75:20 - don't indent the first line of the first
75:22 - paragraph
75:23 - after a heading
75:24 - or after an image or any other figure
75:28 - also don't add extra space in between
75:31 - the paragraphs
75:33 - let's see how this looks on our project
75:36 - now i have two paragraphs in the same
75:39 - text box but i just want to apply
75:41 - paragraph indentation to the second
75:43 - paragraph
75:44 - remember leading paragraphs don't get
75:47 - indented
75:48 - so i'll split the second paragraph into
75:50 - its own text box
75:53 - then i'll set the paragraph indentation
75:55 - to 20 pixels remember this matches the
75:59 - body text size
76:06 - and for good measure i'll remove the
76:08 - paragraph spacing
76:13 - then i'll turn the grid back on to align
76:15 - everything again
76:20 - it's up to you which option you prefer
76:23 - just be consistent throughout the design
76:26 - if you can get all these concepts down
76:29 - it'll be no time before you're creating
76:31 - typographically sound designs with good
76:34 - scale and rhythm
76:36 - alright i'll see you in the next stage
76:39 - where we'll get into the details of
76:40 - laying out type
76:42 - [Music]
76:46 - alright you made it this far good work
76:50 - if all this talk about type hasn't
76:52 - gotten you excited already then just you
76:54 - wait in this stage we'll look at the
76:56 - different ways you can layout type in a
76:58 - design
76:59 - first up is typographic hierarchy
77:02 - this concept is crucial to seamlessly
77:05 - guide readers through a page's content
77:08 - hierarchy helps users understand what
77:10 - information is most important to what's
77:13 - secondary tertiary and so forth
77:16 - in this video we'll look at how to do
77:18 - this with weight style size and position
77:22 - in the next we'll continue on the theme
77:24 - of hierarchy with color and pairing
77:27 - typefaces
77:28 - before we jump in let's check out all of
77:31 - these concepts in action at
77:33 - creativemornings.com
77:35 - let's say i wanted to watch this talk
77:37 - that meg lewis did in minneapolis
77:40 - immediately i'm presented with an array
77:42 - of information that's been arranged with
77:44 - hierarchy and minds
77:46 - first my eyes gravitate towards what's
77:49 - biggest boldest and darkest on the page
77:51 - the speaker's name
77:53 - this is the most important piece of
77:54 - information here and creative morning
77:57 - lets you easily know it
78:00 - next my eyes naturally continue reading
78:03 - and move downward to the title of the
78:05 - talk
78:06 - this is of next importance after the
78:08 - speaker name
78:09 - it's smaller but still prominent
78:13 - my eyes are then drawn to the bright
78:15 - block of color holding the white text of
78:17 - the city code
78:18 - it's a nice touch
78:20 - after i've taken all that in and
78:23 - considered if i'm still interested
78:25 - then i can make my way down to the
78:27 - smaller secondary information and read
78:29 - more about the speaker and where exactly
78:32 - the talk was
78:33 - and some more information about what the
78:35 - talk was about
78:37 - we see bold type multiple sizes
78:39 - different colors different positions and
78:42 - different typefaces utilized to convey
78:45 - the hierarchy of information on the page
78:48 - the combination is not only useful to
78:51 - the user it's also downright good
78:53 - looking
78:54 - these concepts can be incredibly
78:56 - powerful to create useful beautiful
78:58 - websites
78:59 - but they can also get out of hand pretty
79:02 - fast if we don't know what we're doing
79:05 - before you begin styling anything it's
79:08 - smart to familiarize yourself with the
79:10 - site's content to get an overall big
79:13 - picture of everything involved
79:15 - it's often helpful to sketch out a
79:17 - wireframe and then go about numbering
79:20 - content elements starting with one
79:22 - what's of most importance
79:24 - to what's of next importance and so
79:27 - forth until every piece of content has
79:29 - been labeled
79:31 - this system will inform us on how we can
79:33 - utilize typography to accentuate our
79:35 - different pieces of content
79:38 - we can create hierarchies simply by
79:40 - waiting certain blocks of text
79:43 - a reader's eyes will be drawn to the
79:45 - bolder elements on the page
79:47 - this hierarchy helps readers make
79:49 - connections between the content and
79:51 - relate certain sections
79:54 - speaking of sections
79:56 - typography is as much about the
79:58 - treatment of the text as it is with the
80:00 - space surrounding the text
80:02 - thus the importance of white space
80:05 - white space is empty space without
80:07 - content
80:08 - and it plays a key role in the
80:10 - readability of a design
80:12 - it gives the reader space to rest their
80:14 - eyes which reduces the feeling of
80:16 - information overload
80:19 - let's look at the white space of the
80:21 - left and right of our type
80:23 - margins or padding should be used to
80:25 - give your type room to breathe
80:27 - if a sentence comes too close to another
80:29 - element then it can disrupt the flow of
80:32 - reading
80:33 - white space is often underutilized in
80:35 - web design which results in cramped and
80:38 - cluttered layouts
80:39 - also it should be noted that white space
80:43 - doesn't have to be white
80:45 - if you have a dark background with
80:47 - lighter text
80:48 - we would still call that area around the
80:50 - text white space
80:53 - let's check out a good example of white
80:55 - space
80:56 - here's an article on it's nicethat.com
81:00 - a creative inspiration blog
81:02 - it's about polisher
81:04 - a renowned graphic designer
81:06 - notice how there are ample amounts of
81:08 - white space around the type
81:10 - the words are not closing in on borders
81:13 - they're given room to live and breathe
81:16 - as you can see white space can clean up
81:18 - a design and give it an elegant
81:20 - professional feel
81:22 - it can also emphasize content by framing
81:25 - it with an empty space
81:27 - now watch as the white space changes as
81:29 - i resize the browser window
81:34 - the content shifts into one column and
81:37 - the white space is maintained although
81:39 - and different proportions to fit
81:41 - comfortably on mobile
81:46 - alright now that certainly got me
81:47 - excited about hierarchy
81:49 - in the next video let's explore what we
81:51 - can do with style weight size and
81:54 - position typographic hierarchy
81:57 - seamlessly guides readers through a
81:59 - page's content
82:01 - bold weight text makes text stand out
82:03 - more while light text makes it recede in
82:06 - comparison
82:07 - an italic style can also be utilized to
82:10 - denote emphasis or set apart the text
82:13 - for example i can italicize the author's
82:15 - name to differentiate it from the other
82:18 - body text
82:19 - a different weight or italic style can
82:21 - be used to carry emphasis
82:23 - but if you overuse it you can end up
82:25 - with an unbalanced hierarchy and layout
82:28 - where everything is important
82:30 - so in turn nothing is important
82:33 - watch out for how dense your typographic
82:35 - color is on the overall page
82:38 - size is next and it can immensely help
82:41 - in guiding your readers through your
82:42 - content
82:43 - this is why headings have a larger check
82:46 - size than paragraphs while headings are
82:48 - often bold a bold weight is not always
82:51 - necessary to convey hierarchy when size
82:54 - is utilized
82:55 - base font sizes should be at least 14
82:58 - pixels
83:00 - lastly let's look at how position can be
83:03 - utilized to present hierarchy
83:05 - when we're discussing position we're
83:07 - talking about the placement and space
83:09 - around the type in relation to the other
83:12 - elements or blocks of type around it
83:14 - let's look at a site that does this well
83:18 - here's a conference website for black
83:20 - futurism
83:22 - the name of the event is big and bold
83:25 - then my eyes are drawn to the dots where
83:28 - i can check out the program schedule
83:30 - the large days of the week make the
83:32 - daily schedules clear
83:35 - the spacing in between each session
83:37 - easily separates the events
83:39 - this is a great practical yet highly fun
83:42 - and bold take on conference website
83:44 - design
83:46 - next let's look at a more experimental
83:48 - design by jen simmons
83:50 - it utilizes the position of type to
83:53 - present hierarchy and differentiate
83:55 - elements
83:56 - when we arrive on the site we
83:58 - immediately see the large bauhaus
84:00 - headline
84:02 - then our eyes move to the german word
84:04 - for exhibition which is rotated 90
84:07 - degrees in position to the right of the
84:09 - red square
84:10 - the intention of this design was to
84:12 - position type in a bold and unexpected
84:15 - way while using the red square as a
84:18 - grounding focal point which the
84:19 - typography dances around
84:22 - let's jump back into our example now
84:24 - so we're actually already utilizing
84:27 - position to differentiate our content
84:29 - and minor ways by separating our
84:32 - headings and paragraphs from one another
84:34 - when we looked at vertical spacing in
84:35 - the last stage
84:37 - i might want to accentuate our title and
84:39 - author name a bit more though so let's
84:42 - see what we can do with its position
84:45 - i'll center align them and give them
84:47 - some more padding
84:59 - great because of its position a reader
85:01 - can now engage this as separate from the
85:03 - main text which further establishes its
85:06 - hierarchy
85:07 - the center align style is also nice
85:10 - because it feels akin to the title of an
85:12 - old book cover
85:14 - positional hierarchy could also be
85:16 - accomplished with borders or line rules
85:18 - above around or below the type to
85:21 - separate a piece of content from the
85:23 - element around it
85:25 - the possibilities are really countless
85:27 - with hierarchy so remember to not make
85:30 - typographic choices just because
85:33 - a good designer knows when and why to
85:35 - say yes or no to an idea
85:38 - have a reason behind why you're bolding
85:40 - or italicizing text
85:42 - or why you're increasing sizes or why
85:45 - you're moving an element to a certain
85:46 - place
85:48 - while we're on the topic of positioning
85:50 - let's cover alignment
85:52 - text alignment can be justified or
85:54 - unjustified
85:56 - but unjustified is typically more
85:58 - readable
85:59 - justified text creates lines of text
86:01 - which evenly touch the left and right
86:04 - side of the column
86:05 - it's commonly used in newspapers since
86:08 - it's an efficient use of space
86:10 - however this can create large unsightly
86:13 - gaps throughout the paragraph
86:16 - these are referred to as rivers because
86:18 - the end result might look like several
86:21 - rivers of white space flowing throughout
86:23 - the text
86:24 - this makes it difficult for people with
86:26 - dyslexia
86:27 - it's not clear where a line of text ends
86:30 - which unfortunately causes them to
86:32 - switch to the wrong line
86:34 - if you must use justified text turn on
86:37 - hyphenation which allows words to break
86:40 - apart and prevent those awkward gaps
86:43 - left aligned text is the default
86:46 - the words evenly align on the left to
86:48 - form a hard line while the right edge is
86:51 - soft and ragged
86:52 - this allows the words to flow naturally
86:55 - but be aware of bad rags such as a wedge
86:59 - shape that creates an unintentional
87:01 - shape
87:02 - left align text can sometimes create
87:04 - rags on the right side which are uneven
87:07 - gaps often caused by long words
87:10 - minor gaps are expected but gaping holes
87:13 - should be taken into account
87:15 - there's really no easy way to prevent
87:17 - them but we can sometimes avoid them by
87:19 - adjusting font sizes and line lengths
87:22 - then there's right aligned text
87:24 - this is when words are evenly aligned on
87:27 - the right while ragged on the left
87:30 - since english is red left or right left
87:33 - align is more legible for this language
87:36 - while right align text can be a novel
87:38 - change from the usual it can be jarring
87:42 - centered text creates a ragged line on
87:44 - the left and the right if you use center
87:47 - text in a layout it's generally
87:49 - advisable to consistently center align
87:51 - all the text
87:53 - for long form text it can be difficult
87:55 - to read
87:56 - therefore i recommend that you don't
87:58 - center aligned paragraphs longer than
88:00 - three lines
88:02 - that's it for the first part of
88:04 - typographic hierarchy
88:06 - i'll see you in the next video as we
88:08 - dive more into the subject and look at
88:10 - caps and color
88:12 - we just looked at how we can create
88:14 - typographic hierarchy through weight
88:17 - style size and color
88:19 - now we'll continue with that theme
88:21 - seeing how we can establish it through
88:23 - caps and color first let's talk about
88:26 - caps and small cap characters
88:29 - think about an email or text you receive
88:31 - that was in all caps
88:33 - that probably felt like someone was
88:35 - either declaring something important or
88:37 - shouting at you right
88:39 - setting type and capital letters can
88:41 - create emphasis authority or hierarchy
88:44 - in your design
88:45 - if you overuse them or commit the
88:48 - hideous crime of setting all your body
88:50 - copy in them then legibility and
88:52 - readability will seriously be
88:54 - compromised
88:56 - they're best used in small doses like a
88:58 - short headline or a title and the
89:00 - navigation to give an official look
89:03 - we can also utilize small caps to spice
89:06 - up and add hierarchy to a design
89:09 - they're a little less in your face than
89:11 - all caps
89:12 - in case you're not familiar with small
89:14 - caps they look like uppercase characters
89:17 - created near a lowercase size
89:19 - often slightly above the x height of a
89:22 - typeface
89:23 - they're not just scaled down versions of
89:25 - the uppercase
89:27 - their weight and spacing have been
89:28 - finessed to match the overall font
89:32 - some design programs have a way to fake
89:34 - the small caps but i don't recommend it
89:37 - like faux weights and styles and ain't
89:40 - pretty
89:41 - small caps are used for abbreviations
89:43 - like asap
89:45 - official titles like the president of
89:47 - the united states
89:49 - headings like the title for a post or
89:52 - the opening line of a book chapter or
89:54 - blog article
89:56 - they work great with uppercase and
89:57 - lowercase letters along with old style
90:00 - figures
90:01 - they also flow great in body copy
90:04 - because of their less obtrusive nature
90:06 - due to their height being closer to the
90:08 - x height
90:10 - let's see them in action on jessica
90:12 - hish's site
90:13 - she uses small caps to grade a veil as
90:16 - she denotes the categories showcasing
90:18 - her recent work here she opens the
90:21 - paragraph with a line set in small caps
90:25 - and she also uses a nice job cap for the
90:27 - beginning letter of the text
90:29 - a drop cap is a large capital letter
90:32 - that typically spans the height of two
90:34 - or more lines of body text we'll take
90:36 - note of this to use in our design in
90:38 - just a bit but first let's look at small
90:41 - caps
90:42 - to use small caps first make sure the
90:44 - font includes support for small caps
90:47 - the good news is that alegria the
90:49 - typeface we've chosen has small caps
90:51 - available in its sister family alegria
90:54 - sc
90:56 - let's use jessica's site as inspiration
90:59 - and add small caps to the start of each
91:01 - paragraph
91:02 - small caps are typically applied to the
91:04 - first line or simply just the first
91:07 - complete thought in the first line
91:10 - with the text selected go to type
91:12 - details and choose small caps from the
91:14 - letter case section
91:36 - oh yeah this is starting to jive really
91:39 - well
91:42 - let's add a drop cap to our text to give
91:44 - it extra emphasis and style
91:47 - there currently isn't an easy way to do
91:49 - this in figma you have to craft each
91:52 - piece
91:54 - i started by breaking out the n into its
91:56 - own text block
92:02 - then i made its text size 108 pixels so
92:05 - it spans three lines of text
92:09 - next i duplicated the first part of the
92:11 - paragraph and cropped down the first
92:13 - three rows
92:16 - i positioned the rest of the paragraph
92:18 - underneath
92:20 - now it appears as if it's wrapping
92:21 - around the drop cap
92:25 - it accentuates the first paragraph but
92:27 - it's now the biggest piece of type on
92:29 - the page
92:30 - don't worry that'll soon change
92:34 - let's look at how to utilize color with
92:36 - type
92:38 - first you'll want to make sure the text
92:40 - color has good contrast with its
92:42 - background color
92:43 - if the contrast is too low then the type
92:46 - and its background color will start to
92:48 - blend together making it hard to
92:50 - decipher
92:51 - if it's too high then it can tire out a
92:53 - reader's eyes due to the bright nature
92:55 - of screens pure black and white work
92:58 - well together in print but on the web
93:00 - you should stick to a subtle black when
93:02 - set on a white background and vice versa
93:06 - on this example page the text has a hex
93:09 - color code of
93:11 - hashtag 333 which is a dark gray
93:14 - and the background is an off-white color
93:17 - at hashtag
93:20 - f9f9f9 almost all popular content heavy
93:23 - websites utilize a light background with
93:26 - dark text for their main body copy
93:29 - versus a dark background with light text
93:33 - don't forget to take into account
93:35 - colorblindness and accessibility with
93:37 - this concept of contrast
93:39 - look in the teacher's notes for a tool
93:41 - that will allow you to test for color
93:43 - contrast scores
93:45 - you'll want a score of aaa for maximum
93:48 - legibility which is especially helpful
93:51 - for long form texts to be read for a
93:53 - significant period of time
93:56 - a score of a a is a good goal for body
93:59 - text
94:01 - a a large is the lowest amount of
94:03 - contrast needed for headlines or texts
94:06 - around 18 pixels
94:09 - with typographic hierarchy more contrast
94:12 - will grab attention whereas subtler
94:14 - contrast will blend in
94:16 - another way to think about this is the
94:18 - primary or important pieces of content
94:20 - should be easily noticed
94:22 - whereas secondary pieces can blend more
94:25 - with the design
94:27 - alright let's jump back into the project
94:31 - i want to give our title and author name
94:33 - further distinction from the text
94:36 - to do this i'll put a dark background
94:38 - color behind the title
94:40 - i'll use a rectangle
94:43 - align it to the baseline grid
94:48 - and set the fill to
94:51 - pound
94:52 - 1e1e1e
94:54 - and more subtle black
94:57 - then i'll set the color of the type to
95:00 - pound
95:01 - f9f9f9 a more subtle white
95:05 - then i'll just align this text back onto
95:07 - the baseline
95:13 - see how that looks
95:16 - all right
95:18 - now i want to make the author name a bit
95:20 - less prominent by changing its color
95:22 - to do that i'll set it to pound
95:25 - 99999
95:27 - which is a mid-gray
95:29 - it's more subdued yet still meets the
95:31 - accessibility guidelines for text
95:33 - contrast
95:35 - it scores at 5.85
95:39 - great now our title is further
95:41 - accentuated because its color contrast
95:43 - is much higher than the author's name
95:46 - the page is getting there but let's
95:48 - spice it up a little more by adding a
95:50 - burnt orangish red color to our heading
95:53 - 2.
95:54 - with mars being the red planet i think
95:56 - it's fitting
96:00 - this color has good contrast with the
96:02 - background and distinguishes our
96:04 - headings further while adding some
96:06 - variety to the design i'll set the body
96:09 - text to a dark gray
96:11 - pound 333
96:15 - pure black on a white background is hard
96:17 - on the eyes and the gray gives it some
96:20 - nuance i'm going to stop here with color
96:22 - as i don't want to go overboard
96:25 - too many colors can make it hard for
96:27 - users to understand typographic
96:29 - hierarchy and it can clutter up a design
96:32 - smart color hierarchy helps users
96:35 - recognize patterns within the page
96:37 - links should look like links and other
96:39 - elements should not
96:41 - if similar colors are used then users
96:44 - may think something is clickable when it
96:46 - in fact is not
96:48 - keeping heading colors persistent can
96:50 - also aid readers in recognizing them
96:52 - quicker
96:54 - just be sure to not only rely on color
96:56 - when signifying status or interactions
96:59 - multiple indicators make your design
97:02 - more accessible
97:04 - that's it for hierarchy remember it's
97:07 - all about balancing and utilizing these
97:10 - different techniques wisely
97:12 - block quotes headings metadata
97:15 - navigation and more are all at your
97:18 - disposal to style so design wisely with
97:21 - a clear hierarchy
97:23 - to close this session i want to give you
97:25 - some encouragement
97:26 - in an article on typekit frank chamero
97:29 - says
97:30 - i'd suggest that most great examples of
97:33 - fine typography are merely designs that
97:36 - have wise typeface choices savvy use of
97:39 - space and a clear hierarchy that's
97:41 - echoed through the structure and
97:43 - presentation of the text
97:45 - you now know how to do all those things
97:47 - with what you learned from the past few
97:49 - stages
97:50 - it'll take some practice for sure but
97:52 - the groundwork is there
97:55 - in the next video i'll cover layout
97:57 - treatments
97:58 - let's go beyond paragraphs any time
98:01 - there's a list you can opt to make it
98:03 - more engaging by styling it as a
98:05 - bulleted or numbered list
98:08 - and pull quotes help break up the
98:10 - monotony of long columns of text while
98:12 - bringing emphasis to a message
98:15 - punctuation requires characters to be
98:18 - positioned outside the margin edge
98:20 - this is commonly used for pull quotes
98:22 - and bulleted lists to create an even
98:25 - visual edge
98:26 - for example
98:28 - hanging quotes keep the left alignment
98:30 - balanced so it increases readability in
98:32 - the text
98:33 - a quotation mark that is flush with the
98:35 - text like we see here can interrupt the
98:38 - left margin and disrupt the rhythm for
98:40 - the reader compared to the one that is
98:41 - not
98:42 - to keep quotation marks clear of the
98:44 - edges we can give the text a negative
98:47 - text indent
98:49 - we also have the option to hang the list
98:51 - markers in lists which can help the flow
98:54 - of text because the margin edge is well
98:56 - defined and continuous compared to one
98:59 - that is indented
99:00 - either one is acceptable so it's really
99:03 - up to us to go with what feels right
99:06 - text and list items should also be
99:08 - consistently aligned
99:10 - if a list item runs more than one line
99:12 - of text and isn't aligned well then
99:15 - renek flow can be interrupted because
99:17 - our eyes look for straight lines
99:19 - make sure the list markers are away from
99:21 - the edges of text which will make for a
99:24 - much cleaner reading experience
99:26 - another layout trick is using horizontal
99:29 - rules to create clear sections of
99:31 - content
99:32 - a horizontal rule is a divider that can
99:34 - spread across a column
99:36 - it can spread the full width or only
99:38 - cover a portion
99:40 - it can be a simple line or something
99:43 - more ornate
99:44 - check out this example by jules forest
99:47 - the horizontal rule above and below the
99:49 - pull quote give the piece visual
99:51 - interest and emphasize the quoted text
99:54 - when combining text with an image play
99:57 - around with how the text wraps around
99:59 - the image
100:00 - in addition to forming rectangular
100:02 - paragraphs around an image you can make
100:04 - the text glide along the edge of the
100:06 - object in the image check out this
100:08 - design by jen simmons
100:10 - the text forms a rounded edge which
100:13 - wraps around the tomato
100:16 - finally the last example i want to show
100:18 - you is tables
100:20 - tables are an excellent way to show
100:22 - tabular data in columns and rows
100:25 - it helps readers compare content as it
100:28 - easily organizes data on the screen
100:31 - the trick with tables is to use borders
100:33 - sparingly
100:35 - check out the pricing table for slack
100:38 - the columns are subtle and the rows are
100:40 - more defined to help you compare the
100:42 - features
100:48 - lastly let's look at how we can
100:50 - establish hierarchy by pairing different
100:52 - typefaces
100:53 - we talked about how to choose a typeface
100:55 - earlier so we're working under the
100:57 - understanding that we should pair it
100:59 - based on the text typeface we've chosen
101:02 - typeface pairs aren't always necessary
101:05 - and beginners are sometimes encouraged
101:07 - to only use one typeface in order to
101:10 - really learn the ins and outs of good
101:12 - typography until they're ready to start
101:14 - pairing type
101:16 - you can start by staying within a
101:17 - typeface and choosing different weights
101:20 - or you can pair a sans serif with the
101:22 - sarah from the same family for example
101:25 - ff meta and ff meta serif
101:29 - typography gets harder to execute well
101:32 - once you throw two or more in the mix
101:35 - but it's well worth the variety
101:37 - here are some basic pairing rules to go
101:39 - by
101:41 - first pair typefaces with similar
101:43 - proportions
101:45 - this means taking into account what we
101:47 - learned about letter forms from our
101:48 - first stage
101:50 - a sans serif type base with a similar x
101:52 - height proportions and contrast to a
101:55 - serif type base can pair well together
101:58 - you can even utilize super families that
102:00 - have multiple weights of sands and serif
102:03 - counterparts that work great with one
102:05 - another
102:07 - pair typefaces with complementary
102:08 - personalities
102:10 - besides the fact that it's incredibly
102:12 - helpful one of the things i really like
102:14 - about hoffler and coast techniques for
102:16 - combining fonts is how they talk about
102:18 - their typefaces personalities or moods
102:22 - check out the link in the teachers notes
102:24 - as you pair typefaces try to classify
102:27 - the mood each one is conveying and see
102:29 - if they jive and play well together
102:32 - pair typefaces from the same historical
102:34 - period jessica hish whose immersive
102:37 - article on typography is linked in the
102:39 - teacher's notes has some great thoughts
102:41 - on this
102:42 - if you're building a site focused around
102:44 - a certain time period then research and
102:47 - find out as much as you can about
102:49 - typefaces in that era
102:51 - you might even find some pics of a
102:53 - storefront or sign with a great typeface
102:56 - pair for inspiration
102:58 - pair typefaces from the same designer
103:01 - type designers often have a certain
103:03 - style that can be found throughout each
103:05 - of their faces
103:07 - the style forms a common bond that holds
103:10 - the two or more together
103:12 - this especially works in your favor if
103:14 - they have a vast array of families to
103:16 - choose from
103:17 - lastly explore more
103:19 - try out different combinations
103:22 - sometimes you can stumble upon a
103:24 - typeface pair you wouldn't have imagined
103:26 - working
103:27 - it's like kale and frozen bananas you
103:30 - definitely thought they wouldn't work
103:31 - together but oh do they make a tasty
103:34 - smoothie
103:35 - a great site i love to peruse is called
103:37 - fontsnews.com
103:39 - it catalogs different typefaces used in
103:42 - print web and all types of media
103:45 - it's great for inspiration on different
103:47 - type combinations and pairs
103:49 - take a few minutes to check it out all
103:52 - right now let's look at our project one
103:54 - more time
103:55 - i've chosen a typeface for the title of
103:58 - our page whose personality i think pairs
104:00 - well with the theme of the content and
104:03 - our serif alegria
104:05 - it's called pathway gothic 1 and can be
104:08 - found on google fonts
104:11 - notice that it doesn't have a bunch of
104:13 - weights or styles but that's ok for this
104:16 - specific use
104:17 - i chose it due to its tall letter forms
104:20 - and no-nonsense look
104:22 - i mean if the worlds are at war then
104:25 - we're not messing around
104:27 - its tough and classy personality
104:29 - complements alegria's elegant and
104:32 - energetic letter forms
104:35 - i'll set the title in this font
104:44 - then i'll adjust our font size to 124
104:47 - pixels as i want the title to really
104:49 - stand out on the page
104:53 - looks great
104:54 - i really like this typeface pair and
104:57 - feel like the body copy keeps our book
104:59 - vibe intact while the title gives it an
105:02 - authoritative look that fits the theme
105:04 - of the content it almost feels like a
105:07 - newspaper declaring a headline
105:10 - when you get back i'll be waiting for
105:12 - you in our next video on how to go even
105:14 - further with typography we'll talk about
105:16 - how to translate all of this to
105:18 - different screen sizes through
105:20 - responsive design discover more grid
105:22 - systems explore variable fonts and get
105:25 - into some finer details of polishing
105:27 - your typography
105:30 - [Music]
105:34 - what might be a joy to read on a desktop
105:37 - quickly becomes a burden for readers on
105:40 - smaller screens
105:41 - white space quickly decreases our large
105:44 - font sizes overtake the screen and the
105:47 - content gets cramped
105:49 - in this video we'll look at how to
105:51 - remedy those problems through responsive
105:53 - typography
105:54 - responsive typography is a subset of
105:57 - responsive design focusing solely on the
106:00 - typography as it responds to different
106:02 - screen sizes
106:04 - it's extremely important and its details
106:06 - are often overlooked
106:08 - creating a pleasant reading experience
106:10 - for desktop browsers is great
106:12 - but we also must account for the other
106:15 - ways someone may be viewing our site
106:18 - here are some pointers for how type to
106:20 - change from mobile versus desktop
106:23 - first text size
106:25 - generally from mobile and large body
106:28 - text size
106:29 - increasing the text size makes it easier
106:31 - to read on a smaller screen
106:34 - as for headings they're often too big on
106:36 - mobile so it's generally advisable to
106:39 - make them smaller for mobile to free up
106:41 - space and make more text fit comfortably
106:44 - on one or two lines
106:46 - tighten the leading since the screen is
106:48 - smaller you'll want to make the best use
106:50 - of that space by tightening the space
106:52 - between the lines
106:54 - since line length is naturally shorter
106:56 - on the small screen you can get away
106:58 - with tighter leading
107:00 - just be careful the leading is ample
107:02 - enough to be comfortable to read
107:04 - pay attention to line length
107:06 - on mobile the number of characters per
107:08 - line should generally fall within 30 to
107:11 - 40 characters
107:13 - adjust padding as necessary
107:15 - you may notice the padding between
107:17 - paragraphs of text is ample on desktop
107:19 - with the same amount of space on mobile
107:22 - creates awkwardly wide gaps
107:25 - ensure clickable elements such as links
107:28 - and buttons are large enough to tap with
107:30 - a fingertip
107:31 - in the human interface guidelines apple
107:34 - recommends a minimum target size of 44
107:37 - pixels wide by 44 pixels tall
107:40 - in android's material design guidelines
107:43 - 48 by 48 dp is recommended
107:47 - dp stands for device pixels
107:50 - pixels and dp are different but similar
107:54 - dp is the resolution in relation to the
107:56 - physical size of the screen
107:58 - devices have different pixel densities
108:01 - check out a link in the teacher's notes
108:03 - to read more
108:06 - in summary as you practice responsive
108:08 - typography adjust the text size leading
108:11 - line length padding and clickable areas
108:13 - necessary
108:15 - your hierarchy might need rearranging so
108:17 - be sure to translate it clearly at
108:19 - different screen sizes
108:22 - lastly your headings are prone to be too
108:24 - big at small screen sizes so don't
108:26 - forget to give them some finesse
108:29 - i hope that clears up responsive
108:30 - typography for you
108:32 - and gives you some simple rules to guide
108:34 - you along as you practice
108:36 - remember to trust your gut too on what
108:39 - looks right
108:40 - in the next video i'll introduce more
108:42 - grid systems
108:45 - earlier you saw how to use a baseline
108:47 - grid to create rhythm and a design
108:50 - now we'll cover some other types of
108:52 - grids
108:53 - now that you know text is easier to read
108:55 - when it's in a column you may find
108:58 - yourself with designs that have white
108:59 - space
109:00 - how can you lay out the text and other
109:02 - content
109:04 - first up the multi-column grid
109:07 - multi-column grids allow you to create
109:09 - hierarchy and integrate text with photos
109:11 - or graphs
109:13 - you can define certain zones for photos
109:15 - and you can allow content to span
109:17 - multiple columns
109:19 - aim for an average of 40 to 50
109:21 - characters per line
109:23 - back to our project here's an
109:25 - alternative way we could lay out the
109:27 - type in a multi-column grid
109:30 - to create this click the plus sign to
109:32 - add another layout grid
109:34 - you'll want to define the columns so
109:36 - they match up with the baseline grid
109:39 - so it's important to see both grids at
109:41 - once
109:43 - select columns and set it to 3 columns
109:46 - for the margin make it 64 pixels so it
109:50 - spans 2 32 pixel squares
109:53 - for the gutter make it 32 pixels
109:57 - this will work best in order to lay out
109:59 - the type with good measure
110:02 - then arrange the content to align the
110:04 - columns while maintaining alignment with
110:06 - the baseline grid
110:08 - for the headline you'll need to adjust
110:10 - the line height and remove any paragraph
110:13 - spacing if that happened to be set on
110:15 - the text box
110:16 - i added a photo of mars to spice up the
110:18 - white space
110:20 - as you work on it it helps to hide the
110:22 - grids to check out how the layout looks
110:24 - without the red guidelines
110:32 - second up is the hang line
110:34 - in the hang line grid you can divide the
110:36 - page horizontally to designate a given
110:38 - area of the page
110:40 - this is called the hang line
110:42 - the area often contains images footnotes
110:45 - asides and so on that complement the
110:48 - main text
110:50 - lastly the modular grid
110:53 - these were popular among swiss designers
110:55 - in the 1950s and 1960s
110:58 - in this style of grid the artboard is
111:00 - divided into consistent divisions
111:02 - horizontally and vertically
111:05 - content can span across sections as you
111:07 - wish
111:08 - that's it for types of grids
111:10 - keep in mind when you design for the web
111:12 - you want to prepare for a range of
111:14 - screen sizes
111:15 - for instance a mock-up for a responsive
111:18 - website design could be in three parts
111:20 - a desktop design with a three column
111:22 - grid
111:23 - a tablet design with a two column grid
111:26 - and a mobile design with a one column
111:28 - grid
111:29 - if you're interested in learning more
111:31 - check out designers gerschner and
111:32 - mueller brockman for inspiration
111:35 - i put some links in the teacher's notes
111:37 - stay tuned for the next video where
111:40 - we'll look at the super cool world of
111:42 - variable fonts
111:44 - variable fonts are another tool you can
111:46 - add to your responsive toolkit
111:49 - a variable font is a single font file
111:52 - that behaves like multiple fonts
111:54 - this is done with axes that can be
111:57 - adjusted to change aspects of the font
112:00 - common axes include weight width optical
112:03 - size italic and slant
112:07 - a variable font can have a single axis
112:09 - or multiple axes
112:11 - consolidating multiple fonts into one
112:14 - has a performance advantage as the file
112:16 - size is smaller and more efficient
112:19 - it also allows for more variations and
112:21 - type styles dynamically on the screen
112:25 - one use case for this is adjusting the
112:27 - font depending on the reader's device
112:30 - for example you could heighten the x
112:32 - height on smaller screens
112:34 - or you could condense and expand
112:36 - character widths as the viewport narrows
112:39 - and widens
112:41 - let's see some variable fonts in action
112:44 - 4day has the ability to adjust between
112:46 - serif and sans-serif designs
112:49 - as well as different weights
112:53 - devot vore oscillates between a
112:55 - geometric slab serif to a decorative and
112:58 - ornamental font
113:11 - and it can get even more experimental
113:14 - check out this font called in the pines
113:17 - which looks like branches growing
113:31 - i hope that inspired you to check out
113:33 - more variable fonts there are so many
113:35 - creative typographers in the world and i
113:38 - encourage you to be inspired by the
113:40 - fonts you can include in your next
113:41 - project
113:43 - i'll see you in the next video as we
113:44 - look into the finer details of
113:46 - typography
113:48 - now for the fine details of typography
113:51 - to really send your designs into a
113:52 - polished state
113:54 - 1. pay attention to danglies a dangly is
113:58 - a piece of text that awkwardly appears
114:00 - on its own line
114:02 - it can be a single word that wraps into
114:04 - the next line
114:05 - or a single line of text that flows to
114:08 - another column this imbalance can
114:10 - interrupt reader flow and impair
114:12 - readability
114:14 - historically these have been called
114:16 - orphans and widows
114:18 - although that's unkind terminology so
114:20 - i've switched to this inclusive language
114:22 - coined by design leader melee co
114:26 - for example
114:27 - let's look at this static headline that
114:29 - describes a section on a website
114:32 - the last word wraps to a new line on a
114:34 - common desktop screen size
114:37 - adjust the text box to allow it to flow
114:40 - in a single line
114:41 - keep in mind in a design program we have
114:44 - a lot of control over the layout
114:47 - but when it becomes a live product that
114:49 - people use
114:50 - it's not possible to fine tune it for
114:53 - every situation
114:55 - for example
114:56 - we can set these blog article headlines
114:59 - to a reasonable text size so that most
115:02 - headlines fit comfortably on the carts
115:04 - but in reality headlines of various text
115:08 - links will be inserted here
115:10 - and some will appear with a dangly
115:13 - dynamic content can only be controlled
115:15 - to a certain extent
115:17 - in addition there are a wide range of
115:19 - screen sizes and device orientations
115:22 - and it isn't feasible to perfectly plan
115:25 - the text wrapping for every scenario so
115:28 - avoid danglings wherever possible for
115:31 - common screen sizes but also accept that
115:34 - you can't completely eradicate them
115:38 - two use proper punctuation
115:41 - a few common pitfalls are not using the
115:43 - correct quotation mark apostrophe mark
115:46 - and dash
115:47 - the preferred quotation mark is called a
115:49 - curly quote
115:51 - this differs from straight quotes which
115:53 - are used in coding
115:54 - notice how the open and closed quotes
115:57 - are different design programs have an
115:59 - automatic way of turning quotation marks
116:02 - into curly quotes
116:03 - in figma go to the menu in the top left
116:06 - corner
116:07 - click preferences and make sure
116:09 - substitute smart quotes is turned on
116:12 - otherwise you can manually insert smart
116:14 - quotes with your keyboard
116:16 - check out the teacher's notes to see
116:18 - what keys to press
116:20 - if you need to interrupt the text do not
116:22 - use a hyphen a hyphen is the short line
116:25 - on your keyboard which is used in
116:27 - hyphenated words such as part-time
116:29 - musician
116:31 - then there are n and m dashes
116:34 - n dashes are a bit longer than hyphens
116:37 - and are used to indicate a range of time
116:40 - or numbers like one through ten
116:43 - m dashes are even longer and indicate a
116:46 - break in thought
116:48 - for example
116:49 - it's such a beautiful day in the park
116:52 - hey is that squirrel wearing a fedora
116:55 - check out the teacher's nose for the
116:57 - keystrokes
117:00 - another feature of open type is
117:02 - stylistic alternates
117:04 - when a font has this feature it means
117:06 - there is more than one option for a
117:08 - given character for example
117:11 - a font can have several different m's to
117:13 - choose from
117:15 - let's look at an example
117:17 - railway is a google font with this
117:19 - feature
117:21 - go to type details and toggle on and off
117:23 - the stylistic set 1.
117:27 - see how the letter forms change such as
117:29 - the uppercase w and g
117:33 - i put them next to each other so you can
117:34 - compare
117:37 - right you've made it
117:38 - in summary we analyzed the content chose
117:41 - a typeface pair to work with put
117:43 - together a color palette
117:45 - set up our web fonts and typographic
117:47 - scale
117:48 - laid out type with good measure and
117:50 - rhythm
117:51 - create a typographic hierarchy in the
117:53 - design and polished it responsively
117:56 - i hope you all leave this course with a
117:58 - better understanding of typography and
118:00 - know how to execute it well
118:02 - go forth creating designs with nice type
118:07 - [Music]
118:15 - hi i'm hope
118:16 - in this practice session you'll practice
118:18 - typography here's a design for a news
118:21 - article
118:22 - we'll be using this design to practice
118:24 - typography skills do you see anything
118:26 - that can be improved from a typography
118:28 - standpoint
118:30 - think about how you might improve it
118:32 - download the project files and you'll
118:34 - see a couple figma files
118:36 - open up the file that's labeled before
118:39 - and make the improvements
118:41 - if you haven't used figma yet you can
118:43 - open a free account when you have a
118:45 - solution check out the next video and
118:47 - i'll share my solution
118:51 - how did you do were you able to rework
118:53 - the typography
118:54 - let me show you what i did
118:56 - first i noticed the text was set in a
118:58 - single font ariel
119:00 - this is a generic font so it isn't
119:03 - giving the design much character
119:05 - it's also more dynamic to choose a pair
119:08 - of fonts that work together
119:10 - so i knew i wanted a bold display text
119:12 - for the header and an easy to read font
119:15 - for the body text
119:18 - i landed on patua one for the headline
119:20 - and meriwether for the body text which
119:23 - are both available for free via google
119:25 - fonts as a reminder to find an
119:28 - appropriate font for body text look for
119:30 - a font family that contains a range of
119:32 - weights including regular italic and
119:35 - bold also look for low to moderate
119:38 - stroke contrast meaning the text looks
119:40 - balanced and even with little variation
119:43 - of stroke width
119:44 - to further optimize for readability look
119:47 - for large counters and a tall x height
119:50 - for resources to find fonts and font
119:52 - pairings check out the teachers notes
119:55 - by the way let's briefly chat about
119:57 - typescales
119:59 - when i changed the headline to patua 1 i
120:01 - increased the text size because i
120:03 - noticed the design had a low type ratio
120:06 - the type ratio is the difference between
120:08 - the largest and smallest font size
120:11 - so in this case the largest was 30
120:14 - pixels and the smallest was 12 pixels
120:18 - new sites are designed to grab attention
120:21 - therefore it's good to aim for a high
120:23 - type ratio
120:24 - so i made the headline 60 pixels
120:30 - next i wanted to make the body text even
120:32 - more readable by increasing the space
120:34 - between wrapped
120:38 - lines the 18 pixel body text was
120:41 - previously set to auto line height and i
120:45 - increased it to 30 pixels
120:47 - generally you'll want to set line height
120:49 - to 130 to 150 percent of text size
120:53 - although you can play around with it as
120:55 - it's not a hard rule
120:57 - i also softened the body text color
121:00 - it was all solid black which reads a bit
121:03 - harsh on the white background
121:05 - i knocked it down to a dark gray to
121:07 - retain the contrast while giving it a
121:09 - softer edge
121:11 - next i noticed the wide width of the
121:13 - paragraphs
121:15 - my eyes are working hard to scan back
121:17 - and forth over such a wide distance
121:20 - i shorten the paragraphs to a more
121:22 - comfortable width
121:23 - then i rearranged the images and related
121:26 - stories to fit in the white spaces
121:28 - created by the text columns
121:33 - at this point it was looking much better
121:36 - although i wanted to add more visual
121:38 - treatment to really spice it up i added
121:41 - a drop cap which is a classy old-timey
121:44 - print technique where the first letter
121:46 - of a paragraph is an enlarged capital
121:48 - letter
121:49 - the size typically spans two or three
121:51 - lines of text
121:53 - to ease the transition between the drop
121:55 - cap and the following text i capitalized
121:58 - the first significant series of words
122:01 - it's best to use small caps for this
122:03 - since they're specifically designed to
122:05 - be uppercase letters which scale down to
122:07 - lowercase height
122:09 - the meriwether font doesn't support
122:11 - small caps so i use regular capitals
122:15 - regular capitals make the text stand out
122:18 - a bit more than small caps
122:20 - but i like the charm this technique is
122:22 - adding to the design and is better than
122:25 - trying to do a faux small caps
122:28 - the last bit of flourish i added to the
122:30 - body text was the pull quote a pull
122:32 - quote is a statement that's emphasized
122:34 - in an article
122:36 - this breaks up long values of text
122:38 - making it more scannable and
122:40 - entertaining to read
122:42 - finally the last section i improved was
122:44 - the intro text
122:46 - the hierarchy of this text was unclear
122:49 - making it feel out of balance and
122:51 - difficult to decipher
122:55 - i de-emphasize the date and time by
122:58 - making the text smaller and lightening
123:00 - the text color
123:01 - i chose a gray which is lighter than the
123:03 - primary text color yet still dark enough
123:06 - to provide enough contrast
123:09 - i also moved it above the headline since
123:11 - i wanted to create a pattern which
123:13 - allows for a longer title to wrap i
123:15 - didn't want this text to get in the way
123:18 - as for the author's name i tucked it
123:20 - below the subheader to create a balanced
123:22 - layout and an appropriate hierarchy
123:25 - i also softened it by applying the
123:27 - secondary text color
123:29 - that's it for the changes
123:31 - by the way i recommend using styles and
123:34 - figma
123:35 - by defining text and color styles you
123:38 - can define styles once and allow them to
123:40 - trickle through the elements across
123:42 - multiple artboards
123:44 - this makes it much easier if you decide
123:47 - to switch fonts or tweak a color later
123:49 - on
123:50 - instead of changing it for each
123:52 - individual element you can adjust the
123:54 - style in one spot
123:56 - for more info on this check out the
123:58 - teacher's notes
123:59 - if my design looked really different
124:01 - from yours don't worry
124:03 - remember there are lots of different
124:06 - solutions to this and the important
124:07 - thing is to just keep practicing
