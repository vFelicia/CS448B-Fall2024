00:00 - this video is about how to write clean
00:01 - code in your formatting and comments
00:05 - first formatting formatting is
00:07 - subjective the main point is not to
00:09 - argue over formatting just choose a
00:11 - certain type of formatting between you
00:13 - and your team and just go with it it's
00:16 - important to be consistent I'm just
00:18 - going to go over a few things about
00:20 - formatting one is that you should use
00:22 - consistent capitalization so here's an
00:24 - example of the bad way um you can see
00:26 - there's two constants here so you could
00:28 - choose either ways as long as you're
00:30 - consistent but we're going to change
00:32 - this to
00:33 - days in month okay and down here we have
00:38 - two arrays and we have the songs array
00:41 - and the artist array we're just going to
00:42 - make this not capitalized so it'll be
00:44 - consistent now we have two functions
00:46 - this one's camel case this one's not so
00:48 - let's change this so it's consistent and
00:51 - then we have two classes uh just make
00:53 - sure they're consistent if this is
00:55 - lowercase this should be lowercase next
00:57 - up is function collar and Coles should
01:00 - be close together ideally the caller
01:03 - should be right above the call E we tend
01:06 - to read code from top to bottom so it
01:08 - should make sense just reading down how
01:09 - the code supposed to go together so
01:11 - let's look at this bad example we have a
01:13 - bunch of functions and we're going to
01:15 - change the order here you can see that
01:17 - this uh perf review function calls three
01:20 - other functions so we're going to just
01:21 - cut that out and put that
01:24 - first and the first function it calls is
01:27 - get peer reviews so let's put that one
01:29 - right after after the per
01:32 - review and this calls look up here so
01:34 - we'll put that one next it's already
01:36 - next and now the next one that this per
01:39 - riew function calls us get manager
01:40 - reviews so we'll put that
01:44 - next and this is going to call lookup
01:46 - manager so that's next and now this
01:49 - calls get self review which we will put
01:52 - last here so now we've reordered the
01:55 - functions in this so it makes more sense
01:57 - it kind of reads in order now now we're
02:00 - going to move on to comments only
02:02 - comment things that have business logic
02:04 - complexity comments are an apology not a
02:07 - requirement good code comments itself so
02:10 - let's look at a piece of code here we
02:12 - have this function hash it and then look
02:14 - at the first comment the hash well we
02:16 - can tell it's the hash that's what the
02:18 - name of the variable is so let's take
02:19 - that one out and then we have length of
02:21 - string well we can see just by reading
02:23 - the Str the code that this is the length
02:25 - of the string so we don't need that
02:26 - comment this says Loop through every
02:28 - character in data yeah I think most
02:30 - people know that four means it's a loop
02:32 - so we can take that one out um get
02:34 - character code well this says right here
02:36 - care code at so see a lot of comments
02:38 - are unnecessary make the hash well we're
02:40 - saying hash equals something so we must
02:42 - be making the hash this is the only
02:44 - comment we're going to keep convert to
02:46 - 32-bit integer because this may be a
02:48 - little less obvious to some people what
02:50 - it means so you can still keep some
02:52 - comments just nothing that's pretty easy
02:55 - to figure out just by looking at the
02:56 - code the next thing is don't leave
02:58 - commented out code code in your code
03:00 - base that's why we have Version Control
03:03 - so if you have this function do stuff
03:05 - and then you had all these other
03:07 - functions and you're not using them
03:08 - anymore so you commented them out uh
03:10 - just get rid of them because you can
03:13 - always go back using your version
03:15 - control system to previous versions and
03:17 - you don't need to keep that in your code
03:19 - next up is don't have Journal comments
03:21 - this is another thing that you should
03:23 - use your version control for use git log
03:25 - to to get the history of your code so
03:28 - you don't need to have the history re
03:30 - write in your code so we're just going
03:31 - to delete all these and then the last
03:34 - one is avoid positional markers so this
03:36 - right here these are these are markers
03:38 - just to so you can see where in your
03:40 - code you are pretty easily but they just
03:43 - add noise you should let the functions
03:44 - and variable names and just how you
03:46 - format the code give your the structure
03:48 - to your code so you don't need these
03:51 - well thanks for watching this has been
03:52 - the last video in my clean code series
03:55 - all these videos were based on Ryan MC's
03:57 - great article on the topic you can check
04:00 - the link in the description to see the
04:01 - original article my name is Bo KS don't
04:04 - forget to subscribe and remember use
04:06 - your code for good
