00:03 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:06 - Jessie I'm Jessie and I apologize for
00:10 - being 7 minutes late I I had so many
00:15 - things happen all at once right when I
00:17 - was going to start so really sorry it
00:20 - got a couple emails from work and had to
00:24 - respond to those and I've I'm getting
00:29 - errors when I try to commit and when I
00:34 - tried to start the stream the button to
00:35 - start the stream was was like grayed out
00:37 - and I I couldn't get it to start it
00:40 - turns out I just had to refresh the page
00:41 - and it worked but anyway I'm sorry that
00:46 - was really late apologies for that but I
00:52 - was kind of freaking out beforehand
00:53 - because my the project wouldn't wouldn't
00:56 - run at all so I mean that was that was a
00:59 - big deal because we wouldn't really have
01:01 - much of a show if that was the case all
01:06 - right let me check I'm gonna check the
01:12 - live chat really quick because there's a
01:13 - lot in there
01:24 - okay all right so for those of you who
01:29 - haven't seen this show before I'm gonna
01:34 - do some coding and then I'm gonna answer
01:38 - some questions and then do coding and
01:40 - then answer some questions and I'll
01:41 - break it up with a timer so I'm gonna do
01:44 - a 25 minute timer which I'm going to
01:45 - start now and I think maybe I should
01:53 - move I'm gonna move the timer to one of
01:55 - my other screens and we'll just leave
02:04 - the code on this screen let me make this
02:07 - bigger so y'all can see today's
02:10 - livestream is only gonna be around an
02:13 - hour long which is pretty close to what
02:15 - our normal is but I do have to go
02:18 - somewhere shortly after that today so
02:25 - gotta make sure I don't lose track of
02:27 - time all right
02:31 - so I think that should be big enough for
02:34 - everyone to see
02:35 - just to show you what what has gone on
02:38 - and what some of the errors were I
02:40 - upgraded to next version 6
02:42 - I believe it's 6.0 1 is the official
02:47 - version so if anybody is upgrading your
02:51 - react or your next projects to 6 watch
02:54 - out for this it may not affect all of
02:56 - you but if you have a babel RC file and
03:01 - you have these presets the presets need
03:06 - to be arrays so what I had was I had
03:12 - just strings and not arrays and it would
03:15 - not start the server at all it would try
03:17 - to start and then it would exit so that
03:22 - would my issue was simply IDs just
03:26 - needed to be a race so if you're having
03:29 - some similar issues
03:30 - try putting all your values for your
03:34 - presets and your babel others RC file
03:38 - into make him erase now I'm also getting
03:42 - another error so I thought that fixed
03:44 - the problem but when I wanted to commit
03:46 - really quickly before the stream so that
03:49 - you all didn't get the same error if you
03:52 - tried to load this project but my tests
03:55 - failed and I think it's it's a similar
03:58 - issue so I didn't get to completely fix
04:01 - this before I started the stream but it
04:04 - says it couldn't find preset and
04:06 - relative to the directory users Jessie
04:10 - our projects trances can react so this
04:18 - is why I'm assuming that we we have this
04:21 - file here we have tests we have presets
04:23 - and so I'm wondering if this is also an
04:30 - issue and we're gonna try we need to
04:38 - troubleshoot this first before we move
04:40 - on otherwise I'm just gonna push this
04:43 - same error up to github and I don't want
04:47 - to do that I'd rather fix it so this is
04:49 - gonna be CSS hopefully we can fix this
04:52 - in a minute or two if I can't fix it in
04:54 - a minute - I'll just hold off and I
04:57 - won't commit anything and I'll fix it
05:00 - later and then commit all my stuff later
05:03 - but if we can fix it quickly I think
05:07 - it'll be better more rides if I never
05:17 - listen to different rate all right so
05:21 - it's looking for before there all right
05:32 - so let's see
05:37 - Oh quick
05:48 - it's
06:01 - yeah
06:16 - okay so Harshit said that he had the
06:20 - same issue all right awesome hard [ __ ]
06:24 - let me check out says check out the
06:27 - babel RC in JSA f so let's go let me
06:35 - pull over a browser window and we'll do
06:42 - this together so some of you I'm sure
06:46 - have heard me talk about this project
06:48 - before but Carson and I and Niki
06:53 - JavaScript er have been working on a
06:56 - side project called JavaScript AF so
07:01 - this is where we're gonna go right now
07:03 - to get the fix for our issue so I need
07:11 - to go into the front-end correct and if
07:17 - you check this out and github before
07:19 - check it out again and it's a lot easier
07:22 - to contribute now it's all in one repo
07:25 - the backend the front-end are no longer
07:27 - separated all right let me see the
07:40 - difference here let's get rid of that
07:43 - glad I don't have to go through that I
07:46 - wasn't looking forward to it
07:50 - okay let's copy make sure yes
08:08 - just don't copy style confinement stuff
08:11 - okay yeah I didn't yeah I didn't get the
08:14 - style component stuff so whoops
08:18 - and I need one more of those
08:23 - I believe am I good maybe I didn't need
08:28 - one more all right
08:35 - I was kind of one two three four five
08:42 - she goes here and then six go slowly up
08:46 - there seven all right yeah that should
08:50 - work okay let's start that and let's
08:56 - rerun this so I'm gonna do yarn CM and
08:59 - then I'm gonna give it the retry flag
09:02 - hopefully this will work and then we can
09:04 - get started on our CSS so if you were
09:07 - here for just the CSS stuff sorry for
09:12 - the wait it looks like it's working now
09:15 - and it's gonna happen no it still failed
09:24 - I hopefully I didn't get the same error
09:27 - as for finding invalid property of the
09:30 - fault
09:32 - yes all right did I mess it up
09:51 - mmm
09:57 - alright let me verify that this actually
10:00 - is still loading the page and if it is I
10:05 - think we'll just move on to that
10:09 - localhost let's go
10:37 - all right so if this is still loading I
10:40 - think we may just go on to the CSS okay
10:53 - all right so I'll work on that later on
10:55 - if anybody is having similar problems
10:58 - and is really interested on how we fix
11:00 - that just ask me later on and hopefully
11:07 - I'll have that fixed later today okay so
11:11 - here's the page we're gonna go to and we
11:14 - were working on this a little yesterday
11:17 - but we're gonna work on it from a
11:19 - different angle we're gonna do the CSS
11:20 - we were doing it JavaScript and data
11:24 - stuff yesterday so today we'll work on
11:28 - the CSS so this would be a good stream
11:31 - if you're kind of new maybe you're not
11:32 - that great with react or JavaScript but
11:35 - you do know CSS or you're at least
11:36 - learning it then we can see I think I
11:44 - had its didn't have education faculty I
11:48 - don't know if I have this data linked up
11:51 - we'll find out in a second if not I can
11:55 - switch to a different Department yep
12:01 - don't have it all right so let's go with
12:03 - oh I know I know who's English English
12:11 - faculty there we are
12:14 - me too okay harsh it says I need two new
12:22 - dependencies Babel core and Babel just
12:24 - wish the versions in there okay I'll
12:26 - grab those in a little bit okay so this
12:34 - is the page as it is right now it
12:38 - doesn't look great and so just a quick
12:41 - recap of how we got to this point we
12:44 - created some cards we used some pre-made
12:47 - components and then added our own stuff
12:51 - as well and then we're just pulling some
12:54 - data using graph QL
12:57 - we're pulling some data from a wordpress
12:58 - installation and we're getting a lot of
13:04 - markup and then we use some regular
13:06 - expressions to pull out the pieces of
13:08 - the markup that we wanted and this is
13:10 - what we have and we have a couple
13:12 - problems here so the big problem is we
13:16 - have these images and they're obviously
13:18 - different shapes and sizes so what we
13:21 - need to do is create a way to display
13:25 - this that will look good no matter what
13:29 - shape and size image we have okay the
13:37 - hard should I see I see you have the fix
13:40 - I just want to get do a little CSS stuff
13:42 - because I I advertise the stream as CSS
13:46 - so I don't want to get too far off right
13:50 - now maybe I'll try it a little later on
13:54 - in the stream
13:55 - I'll do the fix all right so here's what
14:02 - I'm thinking
14:04 - we can maybe actually you know what we
14:19 - had this issue before we had this issue
14:22 - on a different project let's take a look
14:24 - at a different UI we created a little
14:28 - less than than a year ago so let's go
14:33 - here to khattak addicts comm and this
14:37 - was our first project we did on the
14:39 - stream we had the same issue with really
14:43 - similar components similar similar data
14:46 - and so this is what we had we tried to
14:51 - go with a cart approach but because we
14:54 - have different size and shapes in terms
14:58 - of images it wouldn't work so we ended
15:01 - up going with these rows instead
15:04 - and also we wanted to make sure that all
15:08 - of our text was aligned properly so we
15:13 - obviously couldn't put the images on
15:14 - this side we had to move them that this
15:16 - side I think this is probably the model
15:20 - that we ought to go with so what we'll
15:24 - do is we're gonna we're gonna switch
15:27 - around the mark up a little bit to make
15:30 - it easier to apply our styles but we're
15:33 - basically gonna follow this and we may
15:37 - even come in and grab some styles that
15:40 - we used here so maybe like this little
15:42 - line here might not be a bad idea to
15:44 - just pull the Styles instead of trying
15:46 - to recreate it but unless anyone has
15:50 - objections I think this is the route
15:52 - that that we're gonna go with so since
15:56 - we already did all the work to do this
15:58 - you know what why not use that as the
16:00 - basis for what we're gonna do here it'll
16:02 - be nice and create some consistency
16:04 - between two different sites that are
16:06 - both University sites for Franciscan
16:12 - University so always good that provide a
16:16 - familiar user experience across you you
16:21 - know different sites okay so let's look
16:26 - at the actual file the mark-up for this
16:29 - to see what we need to change because I
16:32 - think this is gonna take a bit more than
16:34 - just CSS we'll have to move around some
16:39 - things in the markup so I'm gonna leave
16:40 - these pages up I'm not gonna close them
16:42 - out since we'll probably be editing them
16:44 - later on to fix our error but right now
16:49 - let's go to I thought I had these pages
16:55 - up maybe I don't
16:57 - [Music]
16:58 - faculty list that's not it I just open
17:06 - it up here no my my node modules folder
17:12 - got open
17:14 - that's the worst and you have to scroll
17:17 - for three days
17:18 - um okay where are my components that's
17:24 - what we want to be components and here's
17:26 - our new component that we've created
17:28 - just in the last few days and that's
17:30 - that list card item and if we turn this
17:35 - into a list row item we'll probably end
17:37 - up changing the name I'm just gonna
17:39 - leave it for now but here's what we'll
17:44 - do right off the bat let's check out
18:02 - no this isn't it faculty list item
18:05 - that's what it is it wasn't Lascar died
18:07 - in this faculty list items so sorry
18:11 - about that let's see okay yeah this
18:18 - looks way more familiar I was scrolling
18:20 - through that component like I don't
18:21 - remember any of this from from yesterday
18:25 - all right so we're not gonna have a card
18:29 - anymore so let's get rid of what we're
18:34 - doing here in terms of setting up a card
18:37 - and let's switch it out and for now
18:42 - let's just add divs so I'm just gonna
18:48 - select whoa didn't realize there wasn't
18:53 - oh I see what it is let's add some divs
18:58 - I need to go way up here to card and
19:01 - change this to do and let's make sure we
19:05 - do the same here we'll do do alright so
19:12 - this will be our outermost container and
19:14 - then we have some things in here like
19:16 - card actions I'm actually really
19:21 - interested to see what things look like
19:24 - if we just remove the outer card and we
19:28 - leave the other things in there oops I
19:32 - capitalized Dave I don't know what I was
19:33 - thinking and so we don't need card so
19:45 - let's just import card actions apart
19:48 - content so let's just see what it does
19:54 - we should have gotten Auto refresh it
19:57 - looks like there we are nice okay this
20:01 - is what I was hoping would happen so
20:04 - we've actually kept a lot of the styles
20:07 - here like for for the button here that's
20:10 - that's exactly what I wanted so that's
20:14 - good news
20:15 - you know one thing that we're not
20:17 - getting though that we did get before is
20:21 - we had a we had more info showing up
20:25 - let's see why we're not getting that
20:28 - info also I don't know if you notice
20:30 - this I installed we had a talk yesterday
20:33 - about how my imports are a mess and so I
20:38 - went ahead and did a setting so I
20:42 - upgraded my Visual Studio code and I
20:45 - notice there is a new setting to where
20:46 - you could if you turned it on it would
20:50 - auto organize all your imports the only
20:54 - problem is that it also adds semicolons
20:56 - which we have set for there not to be
21:01 - semicolons so I I don't know
21:05 - so my in court it seems like my imports
21:09 - can either be organized with semicolons
21:11 - or not organized without them I'm hoping
21:14 - that it'll just get Auto formatted once
21:16 - it gets committed and then it'll be okay
21:19 - all right so why are we busy are we
21:26 - missing some of this
21:39 - yeah we should we should be getting the
21:42 - title right in there and for some reason
21:52 - we're not I mean we're still getting the
21:56 - image obviously unless for some reason
21:59 - it's the font is white and I just can't
22:03 - see it would be odd but I guess it's
22:07 - worth checking
22:21 - okay it it looks like yeah we're not
22:26 - getting me yeah it should be here should
22:33 - be in this pizza we're not getting sorry
22:35 - that the dev tools font is probably
22:37 - insanely small not string that up again
22:45 - okay so here where there should be
22:47 - content there's not
23:05 - all right let's play around with this
23:07 - just for a second to see why this isn't
23:12 - coming in still nothing okay there we
23:20 - are so we got something this time why is
23:29 - there so much going on this time all
23:35 - right so now let me try to put this back
23:37 - in because this should be what we want
23:40 - basically where the title gives us an
23:46 - array of two values and we don't want to
23:51 - we want one okay
23:52 - great that works not really sure what
23:54 - was going on there but this gives us
23:56 - what we want and it gives us what we
23:58 - need to continue on with our styling so
24:00 - in terms of markup let's let's try to
24:05 - make this a little bit easier for to
24:09 - handle with our CSS so let's grab this
24:19 - div that is our image and let's throw it
24:25 - down here below our card actions it's
24:32 - this word now we want it down here so
24:38 - we're gonna throw it down below here and
24:41 - I'm gonna get rid of this we were
24:42 - keeping it to test it out but now that
24:45 - we're not gonna use a card I don't think
24:47 - we will use it that'll just clean up our
24:50 - component a bit
24:56 - we have about two more minutes before I
24:59 - do some questions from the live chat so
25:03 - hang in there if you have some questions
25:05 - and okay there we are so now we have our
25:11 - images below which in in terms of the
25:16 - flow of you know the this site is will
25:19 - obviously be a left to right site that
25:22 - makes more sense with the markup okay
25:25 - now let's get into some of the styling
25:30 - that we could do we have a few options
25:32 - we could style you know completely
25:36 - custom with CSS well we could maybe take
25:39 - advantage of some of things we have
25:44 - available to us with material you I I
25:46 - think I want to just do some regular CSS
25:49 - styles though so what we'll do is we
25:55 - will we already have some class here
26:01 - class of card on everything and did we
26:08 - did we wrap this in anything else we did
26:11 - not great but what we did do in our
26:17 - faculty list component where we're
26:20 - pulling this in oops that's our faculty
26:22 - this query let's get rid of that for now
26:24 - here's our faculty list component what
26:28 - we did was we put our all our faculty
26:35 - stuff in this masonry layout this
26:38 - masonry flat with the grid so we want to
26:42 - you know stop doing that and we'll keep
26:47 - this container
26:49 - we'll take out masonry right and then
26:55 - for our grid we can keep the grid and
27:01 - that won't really be an issue if we want
27:08 - but what we need I guess we need a grid
27:15 - container what we need to do is get rid
27:19 - of this and let's let's bring back and
27:27 - just call this but let's say that see
27:29 - what happens I think we're gonna need a
27:31 - container though for a grid also we're
27:33 - gonna get it's not gonna like that we
27:35 - took out masonry
27:47 - oh maybe it just automatically took it
27:49 - out for me awesome okay so now you see
27:54 - these all are a hundred percent of the
27:59 - width of the container so that's what we
28:02 - want it these are now rows okay so
28:05 - that's a that's a good first step next
28:11 - step after we take a little break for
28:13 - questions is going to be getting these
28:14 - images over here and getting them to be
28:17 - not quite so large once we get those
28:21 - over there then we can work on how to
28:25 - display this information and and the
28:29 - most attractive way possible so let me I
28:36 - guess I don't have to do anything on the
28:37 - screen let me go over to the chat and
28:39 - I'm gonna start up at the top I'm gonna
28:41 - scroll through look for any questions
28:43 - I'm gonna set a five-minute timer and
28:48 - we'll see how much I can get through
28:49 - five minutes and I need to make sure I
28:53 - keep an eye on the clock I have my phone
28:55 - here okay it's 11:35 my time 11:35 a.m.
29:01 - so gotta make sure I don't go really
29:06 - don't go past noon too much so so what
29:14 - as it was a feast for days asked what is
29:17 - the age of consent for CSS in the US is
29:21 - this obviously a joke but that's that's
29:23 - good one see
29:35 - so see a lot of you saying hello hey
29:38 - everybody
29:39 - we have someone I is it's aya Z if I'm
29:45 - mispronouncing that please let me know
29:46 - it says hi I'm new welcome thanks for
29:50 - watching and thanks for letting me know
29:53 - you're here in the chat is si I don't
30:00 - know something about coding okay so if
30:02 - you're beginner feel free to ask
30:04 - questions I'll do my best to answer them
30:05 - and explain what I'm doing there's a lot
30:07 - of other people in the chat that are
30:08 - very helpful lord dragon as how often
30:16 - does this happen and I'm assuming Lord
30:19 - dragons talking about the errors and
30:20 - things that were happening yeah it's I
30:25 - don't know I mean errors like that I
30:29 - mean that was pretty serious the whole
30:30 - site was like wouldn't start that's not
30:32 - that often but you know things do mess
30:35 - up so almost all these things don't go
30:40 - exactly according to plan so these these
30:43 - are I will say these are real projects
30:45 - that I'm doing for my employer so I
30:48 - don't rehearse any of this so when I
30:51 - mess up we fix it together here on the
30:56 - stream and I I mess up a lot so that's
31:00 - that's what you get here so it's not
31:01 - exactly a well planned out tutorial but
31:05 - it is an authentic glimpse into what I
31:09 - do as a my titles front-end developer
31:12 - but we do back in at times as well let's
31:20 - see alright Phoenix says the
31:26 - notification from YouTube came on time
31:28 - today which is awesome yesterday had an
31:30 - issue where Phoenix didn't get the
31:31 - notification or didn't get it till
31:33 - really late so I'm glad you got it I
31:35 - asked us how can I get started with
31:37 - coding I as I think if you go to free
31:41 - code camp org and go through some of
31:45 - those exercises that's a really easy way
31:47 - to get started
31:49 - it's easy in terms of setup you just
31:51 - need a browser and an internet
31:52 - connection and you could start there so
31:55 - if you just work your way through some
31:58 - of those challenges and free code camp
32:01 - and then their lessons I think that'll
32:05 - give you an idea for you know maybe do
32:07 - you like it this is something you want
32:09 - to pursue further and then you know you
32:11 - can keep going further on and progress
32:13 - like that yeah John says another bit of
32:21 - advice to new people put your seat belt
32:23 - on it's a ride a knowledge ride I like
32:26 - that one
32:38 - uh JJ solo says looks like a hacker and
32:43 - not a web coder haha I didn't realize it
32:47 - looked like a hacker so I don't know if
32:50 - that's a compliment or not but let's
32:53 - take it as a compliment so evidently I
32:55 - look like a really awesome hacker
33:12 - Christian asks what is the difference
33:14 - between material UI and bootstrap yet so
33:19 - hardship gives an answer here material
33:21 - UI is based on Google's material design
33:23 - framework and material UI also is
33:26 - designed to work in with react
33:28 - components so bootstrap on the other
33:32 - hand is its own as don't style and it's
33:36 - also designed to work on almost say like
33:42 - let's say sites websites that don't have
33:45 - a particular JavaScript framework it or
33:48 - library like angular react to you so a
33:51 - bootstrap is easier to use for just a
33:53 - plain JavaScript HTML CSS site although
33:57 - I do believe there are versions out
34:00 - there that can be used with things like
34:03 - angular and react alright so I didn't
34:10 - get to all the questions but I will
34:12 - after our next session is over or I will
34:18 - at least try to get to everything right
34:19 - now I just started another 25-minute
34:21 - Pomodoro session we're gonna get back to
34:23 - the code and let's see oh did you all
34:32 - y'all heard the alarm from oh I forgot
34:34 - my my laptop speakers must still be on
34:40 - and my headphones which are normally in
34:43 - my laptop or in my phone so that I don't
34:45 - waste any computing power on running
34:49 - Spotify alright so our next step then is
34:56 - to display this on this side over here
34:59 - so let's just do a little bit of work
35:01 - right here in dev tools so I think it's
35:04 - it's always very useful to do working
35:07 - dev tools by the way if you haven't
35:10 - already done so it might not be a bad
35:11 - idea to check out the the latest in
35:17 - what's available in dev tools so at one
35:20 - of the sessions at the Google i/o
35:22 - conference they did a
35:25 - on the new stuff in in dev tools so you
35:31 - that's on the Google Developers YouTube
35:34 - channel so check that out definitely
35:37 - worthwhile a lot of cool tools so I'm
35:42 - still not familiar enough with them to
35:44 - use them yet but I think I might need to
35:46 - watch the talk again in practice but
35:50 - definitely some good stuff so let's see
35:52 - what we can do here and here's what I'm
35:57 - gonna try first
35:58 - let's give let's let's try using a bit
36:01 - of flexbox here okay unfortunately well
36:05 - are we already using flex nice
36:11 - let's give it a display flex okay and
36:17 - then let's set my on the top oops I
36:25 - don't want to be I'm one step up from
36:30 - where I want to be I actually want to be
36:31 - down here so we'll give this a display
36:34 - flex hey already looking like a little
36:41 - better here so we'll give this a display
36:43 - flex and let's see okay so by default
36:59 - let's see flex direction
37:07 - let's just go these are the options we
37:09 - have we could do a column which is what
37:11 - we had before we don't want call them
37:13 - reverse which flips the site flips the
37:20 - content and then we could GU row or row
37:24 - reverse so we want row which we'd
37:27 - defaulted to anyway so we're gonna go
37:29 - with that but that just gives you an
37:34 - idea of your options and let's see just
37:37 - justified content here's some some other
37:40 - options we can go with so you can see we
37:42 - can Center our content and flex it so
37:45 - it's it's not actually that great to use
37:50 - right now because there's not a whole
37:52 - lot of space right but what what I would
37:57 - like to do is set things to the left
38:01 - okay there'll be a line left and then
38:05 - let's go down to this and for this one
38:10 - let's say justify self and we'll go
38:16 - rights that should have done that maybe
38:21 - there's just not enough space not yeah
38:23 - it should have adjusted interesting
38:35 - I got a I shouldn't have to do this yeah
38:45 - i what am I doing wrong just fat content
38:50 - okay
39:02 - the first two times inside the same diff
39:06 - okay so John's saying the first two need
39:09 - to be inside the same div all right so
39:12 - that's messing things up alright let's
39:15 - go ahead and adjust the mark-up a bit so
39:19 - that we can get a better result and then
39:23 - also let's do the the mark-up first so
39:30 - down here within our faculty list item
39:33 - component which now or is gonna be a row
39:41 - basically we need to say have our card
39:54 - actions and our card content in the same
39:58 - div so let's just create a div here and
40:07 - class name equals classes that's Louis
40:25 - we'll call it text content and that'll
40:29 - give us something to use as a class here
40:31 - and when we need it down here yeah this
40:41 - is where we need our end all right
40:46 - is that it let's see
40:56 - I think so alright let's go back over
41:00 - here we can see already this is aligning
41:04 - much more nicely for us so now we only
41:08 - have two kind of sub groupings here
41:14 - within our list actually what's this
41:18 - happen there we are there's the div um
41:24 - I'm looking at so within this div we
41:29 - only have two sections two divs now
41:31 - better direct children and that's better
41:34 - that's what we want so let's go back to
41:38 - here to this one and so if you hear the
41:44 - vibrating noise I'm getting a phone call
41:45 - but I don't know who it is I'm not gonna
41:47 - answer it so what I want to do justify
41:53 - self and I wanted to see if that would
41:57 - work it looks like it's still not
41:58 - working so it looks like John had some
42:01 - other things see what he said between Oh
42:14 - excellent
42:15 - John you are awesome so we can use this
42:19 - justify content space between to
42:22 - basically get the the effect we want so
42:25 - let's take what we've done here and
42:27 - apply it in our actual project and let's
42:33 - let's see how it looks on all of these
42:36 - next step after that we'll be tackling
42:38 - you know these images we need to make a
42:41 - the maximum height to the images the
42:44 - width is gonna be okay and as long as
42:48 - it's not outrageous you know any width
42:50 - will do but we do need a maximum height
42:53 - so let's go ahead and do that I think
42:56 - the way let's see display for X [ __ ]
42:59 - sticks are just like content space
43:00 - between okay I can remember that so what
43:05 - did we name this outer div I believe
43:10 - our classes card yeah which we had yes
43:21 - with 100% on so now with our with 100%
43:26 - we're gonna add this now I do have to
43:30 - say this is gonna look a little bit
43:31 - different than normal CSS so I had
43:33 - anticipated we would be using a regular
43:35 - stylesheet but after looking at the
43:37 - markup and working with it I think this
43:39 - will be the better way to go so this is
43:41 - actually using CSS as JavaScript
43:47 - essentially this is JavaScript object
43:49 - but in terms of what we call things and
43:52 - the values we give them it's gonna be
43:54 - pretty much the same as normal CSS so
43:57 - let's go with display flex and we had
44:07 - what was it I already forgot it I
44:10 - thought I could remember it Oh flex
44:11 - direction Rho which we don't need
44:14 - because it's gonna be there by default
44:16 - so let's leave that out and then we need
44:18 - justify content C and we're gonna camel
44:24 - case because we're in JavaScript land
44:26 - right now and in hyphens mean minus
44:30 - signs and we're gonna do the space
44:32 - between we can leave the hyphen in but
44:37 - in this case because we put it in single
44:40 - quotes which makes it a string in so
44:42 - that's okay all right so we have that
44:44 - and then if you remember we made another
44:47 - div and we called that it was text
44:53 - content right so we're gonna say for our
44:57 - text content actually do we need to do
45:00 - anything with that no we don't and we
45:08 - don't need that okay great so we
45:10 - actually don't need this which is
45:14 - wonderful
45:15 - less whoops I got rid of the comma that
45:18 - I needed let's save that and then I'm
45:20 - gonna do a hard refresh or just a
45:23 - fresh and that'll just get rid of
45:25 - anything that we had left over here in
45:27 - chrome so that it doesn't interfere and
45:29 - we know for sure that this is our stuff
45:32 - that we put in our project and not our
45:34 - test stuff in chrome and nice one thing
45:41 - I don't understand that why this is
45:43 - happening but we keep getting alternate
45:46 - order for this data so I think maybe at
45:52 - the later time what I'm gonna have to
45:55 - address that but not bad not bad so
46:04 - let's let's shrink these down let's at
46:07 - least see what what the height is for
46:10 - these looks like 300 pixels so let's see
46:15 - if we put a max height on these images
46:21 - let's see what we get so once again
46:24 - we'll do it in dev tools first we may
46:27 - even be able to do it on the detail
46:29 - image you let's let's do that since we
46:31 - can grab it from from the tag name and
46:39 - apply it everywhere and let's set max
46:41 - height 300 pixels whoa let's get our
46:56 - image here
47:10 - alright let's try it again let's put our
47:17 - 300 pixels here okay much better much
47:21 - much better okay so it's it's still not
47:25 - gonna be the most visually appealing
47:27 - thing so at some point it might be nice
47:30 - to go in and what we would need really
47:33 - is to look up or in our photo archive if
47:35 - we actually have photos that are more
47:38 - like this for these professors and then
47:42 - if we don't we'll need to get our
47:45 - photographers to set up appointments
47:48 - with these professors to take you know
47:50 - professional photo that would give us
47:53 - what we need for kind of for
47:54 - Standardization of the site but doing it
47:58 - this way does allow us to have various
48:01 - sizes of images and it doesn't throw off
48:05 - our entire layout so I think we're gonna
48:10 - go with this for now the only thing I'd
48:12 - like to add is that kind of horizontal
48:14 - line in here so we'll do that and then
48:20 - once again we've lost the we've lost
48:25 - some of our data so yeah that's that's a
48:30 - problem for later on
48:31 - I'm not going to tackle that during this
48:33 - stream okay so let's add this style up
48:40 - now into our component so we're gonna go
48:44 - down here Oh actually no we're getting
48:48 - we're gonna need to add some CSS in here
48:51 - into a CSS file so what we'll do it
48:57 - we'll do it in here
48:59 - so in our faculty list component I
49:03 - believe we're already bringing in styles
49:06 - here's our Styles so let's make a CSS
49:10 - page this faculty list okay yeah so what
49:19 - we want
49:21 - actually let's let's do it like this I
49:23 - want to keep whatever styles we have in
49:25 - faculty and then I want to see if we can
49:28 - bring in another style sheet and we'll
49:33 - call that faculty list and this is gonna
49:37 - seem like overkill right now but we'll
49:39 - probably end up adding styles to this so
49:42 - don't don't worry about it and if it
49:47 - does end up being overkill dev - style
49:49 - sheets will we can refactor hmm sorry
49:56 - about the yawn alright so we need to
49:59 - actually create this so we're gonna go
50:01 - into our static styles and we're gonna
50:05 - add another page and we're gonna still
50:08 - call this faculty list dot CSS and now
50:16 - see it's open and we're gonna we're
50:18 - gonna say in our faculty list dot CSS
50:21 - anything that's in this detail oops and
50:27 - what's what is a detailed view image
50:31 - element and it's an image we're gonna
50:38 - MIT set it at a max height of 300 pixels
50:47 - and let's save that we'll see see what
50:53 - happens here let's give it a refresh to
50:55 - get rid of what we've just done here all
51:01 - right wonderful so that's been pooled in
51:03 - oh and for a second we actually had the
51:07 - data that we wanted and what happened
51:09 - what happens happening weird and in this
51:14 - component so at least we have hmm there
51:23 - were images looking better better than
51:28 - they were and you can see this CSS has
51:32 - now successfully been imported
51:35 - here and if we we look we can see in dev
51:40 - tools that it's pulling that from
51:42 - faculty list dot CSS see we can see it's
51:45 - right here and we still as well have our
51:55 - other other styles being applied that
52:02 - were already there as well as our Styles
52:05 - here and then any inline styles that we
52:09 - may want to use those are applied as
52:11 - well so we have a lot of different
52:12 - levels of styles going on okay Harshit
52:17 - said check the console which is a great
52:19 - idea to see what what may be going on
52:21 - here did not match okay it says warning
52:29 - prop dangerously set enter HTML did not
52:32 - match server client interesting so it
52:42 - looks like that is why I'm getting this
53:08 - I said I
53:26 - yeah all right so something's wrong with
53:29 - the way I'm pulling in this title
53:31 - content so it looks like it's pulling it
53:35 - in initially but then it's taking it out
53:37 - because it's not matching what we'll
53:42 - divers on the server so anyway we'll
53:45 - we'll tackle that let me check how much
53:47 - time we have in this comodoro session
53:50 - okay about only about five more minutes
53:52 - so basically at this point I'm just
53:55 - gonna go I'm gonna do some more
53:57 - questions because I need to end the
53:59 - stream in a few minutes anyway so if I
54:02 - were getting all the data here that I
54:04 - would like to have then we may do a bit
54:08 - more styling just to make sure
54:09 - everything lines up and we would add
54:10 - that horizontal in here but basically
54:12 - it's gonna end up looking somewhat like
54:16 - this which I think will look pretty nice
54:21 - the only adjustment to make them may be
54:23 - made is like right now compared to the
54:26 - text the images are quite large you
54:28 - might not be a bad idea to maybe shrink
54:30 - these and do max height of maybe 250
54:33 - pixels that way more faculty members can
54:35 - be displayed at once you know you could
54:39 - see them on one screen there wouldn't be
54:41 - the oldest space here so that I mean
54:44 - there there are some things that
54:45 - definitely could be done to improve it
54:48 - so right now I need to hurry through the
54:55 - rest of this live chat so normally I
54:57 - like to take my time and answer all the
54:59 - questions but unfortunately today I
55:01 - cannot and I actually completely forgot
55:05 - I had somewhere to go until I already
55:09 - started the stream and then I I got a
55:12 - message on my phone that I had that I
55:17 - had an employment and I panicked for a
55:21 - second and thought when is it when is it
55:23 - and but I I still had time to stream
55:26 - just a quick one all right I'm trying to
55:29 - figure out where I left off in the chat
55:36 - okay the Stevens here Steven says hey
55:39 - hey how's it going
55:43 - deepak says thank you so much for
55:45 - sharing your time with us all you're
55:47 - welcome well I mean that you all are
55:50 - sharing your time as well so I
55:52 - appreciate that
55:54 - appreciate you all watching in and
55:56 - helping me so don't this is definitely
56:01 - not a one-sided thing here
56:12 - well Michael said why not set max height
56:15 - of road of to 300 to scale everything
56:17 - down yeah I guess I could have tried
56:19 - that although when we tried to set the
56:21 - container did for this image down to 300
56:24 - the image is just kind of bled out
56:25 - anyway so anyway I mean this this works
56:30 - as it is I suppose but but had I seen
56:35 - that message earlier I probably would
56:36 - have tried it oh and then John said the
56:42 - same thing set it on the outer div group
56:47 - and let me try to pronounce this it's
56:50 - gee you are you Raj guru rush I'm gonna
56:56 - say guru Raj let me know if that's not
56:59 - how to pronounce it says please make
57:00 - shopping cart app with angular 6 and
57:02 - nodejs and latest material design I
57:06 - haven't worked with angular for a long
57:10 - long time let alone angular 6 so I don't
57:12 - think I'll be making that anytime soon
57:16 - so if anybody else has anything like
57:18 - that they're working on with egular
57:23 - please let us know
57:37 - see
57:55 - Michael creo says dr. John Homs yes we
58:00 - have a dr. John homes or homes or
58:08 - whatever you want to pronounce it I
58:09 - don't know
58:26 - okay Michael good thinking on that
58:29 - michael says the faculty right now are
58:32 - being brought in by their faculty ID and
58:34 - so that's how they're ordered but they
58:36 - should be ordered by last name
58:38 - alphabetically so we will do that
58:41 - actually I need to check what the
58:43 - current order is on the main website
58:45 - that's that's live the one that will be
58:47 - replaced and see if they actually are an
58:52 - alphabetic order there or if there's a
58:54 - different order I hope itself abetik oh
58:56 - I don't want to do a custom order for
58:57 - everyone all right looks like there's
59:00 - two more questions and then I have to be
59:03 - finished Matthew says what do you
59:07 - recommend if my job discourages asking
59:10 - for any mentorship in my programming
59:12 - skills I hear that it's really key to
59:17 - help help me grow but my boss wants me
59:20 - to be a 100% independent what do I do
59:27 - I would say that the best thing that you
59:30 - could do maybe is find information that
59:33 - shows how much mentoring will help you
59:37 - and really how being 100% independent
59:41 - will make you less productive because I
59:43 - definitely believe it will so I don't
59:45 - offhand know of any studies or
59:47 - information that I can point you to but
59:49 - I'm sure it's out there so I would maybe
59:51 - find that share that with your boss I
59:55 - mean you you know your boss better than
59:57 - I do of course so I don't know the best
60:00 - way to approach him with that
60:01 - information you may not want to just
60:04 - confront him with it maybe you wanted to
60:05 - slip in little comments here and there
60:07 - to warm him up I don't really know but
60:10 - you know you you want to show your boss
60:15 - how this will make you a better employee
60:17 - because that's probably what he's
60:19 - worried about you know and then if you
60:21 - can convince him of that then he should
60:25 - be okay with with mentorship and if he
60:32 - isn't still okay with it then then come
60:35 - ask me and we can think about a strategy
60:39 - for the next
60:42 - Phoenix says hey Jesse just an update on
60:44 - my 30 days 30 sites it's going good but
60:47 - it looks like I am doing 30 days 30
60:50 - landing pages ha ha hey well it's it's
60:55 - still coding still coding every day
61:03 - okay that's CSS file you created was
61:06 - there a period in front of that class
61:08 - attribute and in from the image or I
61:10 - don't understand that
61:11 - where was it thoughtfully CSS no no
61:16 - period because the actual name of the
61:18 - elements is detailed view image right so
61:23 - we can see here the detailed view image
61:26 - so we're not targeting a class we're
61:29 - targeting in elements so I mean this
61:32 - technically is completely okay I believe
61:35 - in html5 it became okay
61:38 - don't I'm not sure that that's exactly
61:41 - when but so this wouldn't pass like I
61:46 - don't know what are those HTML
