00:00 - Hey i'm back with my third dear, erm, dear Preethi series and
00:04 - This time I'm going to answer your question another question I get pretty frequently actually
00:08 - so this one this
00:10 - Writer said, "I know HTML, CSS Javascript Jquery blah blah blah
00:16 - I followed lots of tutorials to make simple sites and but now I'm stuck. What do I do next what can I use
00:24 - to start building something like I want to actually build something."
00:29 - I've kind of like this question a lot and I've also been in his position before as well
00:35 - so you might you know you might be in the same position where you've kind of gone through a bunch of
00:41 - Tutorials you learned a bunch of stuff
00:43 - you maybe spent a bunch of time learning syntax and things like
00:47 - Conditionals and data types and classes and so forth so you kind of collected a bunch of knowledge here
00:53 - And there we are like what what's kind of next, right?
00:57 - You actually want to build something, but it feels like you have a bunch of disparate knowledge
01:01 - And you don't know how to put everything everything together. I think the answer to this will be a little bit different for everyone because
01:09 - There's no way I can sit here and tell you the exact steps of what to do next
01:13 - but I'll kind of give you a framework for how to think about your next step once you've kind of reach this position where you're
01:18 - no longer just learning the basics, but you want to get to the next step so
01:22 - First thing I would say let's take a step back and remember
01:25 - Why you want start learning end up learning to program in the first place, right?
01:29 - So I think I obviously agree that everyone should learn to program
01:33 - But I think it's a good starting point to understand what you personally want to get out of it
01:39 - Are you trying to be the best designer? Are you trying to be a web developer?
01:42 - Are you trying to be a mobile developer, so you can build a mobile app or are you trying to just use?
01:49 - Programming for your own personal hacks that you want to script up or are you trying to maybe build your grandma's website for her bakery?
01:57 - Whatever it is
01:58 - think about think back to the time that you
02:01 - started programming and think back to the time of why you got so motivated to learn to program and
02:06 - Personally I want to learn to code because I want to build this learning app
02:10 - Where I can use writing techniques to help you or anything that you've ever read
02:15 - And I was really passionate about being bringing this idea to life and I want to learn the skills to bring this idea to life
02:22 - So for me it made sense to learn web development and so depending on what you're trying to accomplish
02:27 - you can figure out what you need to learn right and
02:31 - Regardless of whether it is honestly
02:33 - it doesn't matter just remember that goal and keep it in the back of them ask back of your mind because that's
02:38 - What's going to make motivate your day to day
02:40 - So that's the big picture and then before going to that huge lofty goal that got you started
02:45 - You think smaller right you have to get started somewhere?
02:48 - So personally what I did was I choose a problem that I want to solve at work so at the time
02:54 - I was working in Andreessen Horowitz and I want to build a web application
02:58 - That would help entrepreneurs understand
03:01 - software as-A-service
03:03 - metrics so one of my focus areas when I was there was I'd focus on sas businesses and a lot of
03:09 - entrepreneurs sometimes didn't really understand how to analyze the businesses and how to how to
03:14 - Understand the metrics and I kind of want to create this website that would have
03:18 - Like a flow diagram those clickable and you can get the definitions you can get the relationships between the different metrics and so forth
03:26 - so is this kind of pretty simple web web app one single page web app and
03:31 - For you. It doesn't really matter what you pick as your first project honestly just pick something that
03:38 - You care about enough that when stuff goes wrong because stuff will go wrong. You're still motivated and inspired to keep going and
03:47 - Frankly, it's not like this is the last application you're ever going to build right you're just going to build a ton more
03:51 - this is just the first one so you start somewhere pick something that you care about and
03:55 - Maybe over time you can even rebuild that better and better two three four times as you become a better programmer
04:02 - So so I had this idea of this application
04:05 - So what I did was I mapped out the idea. I figured out who the target users are for the features
04:10 - I want this app to have what is the functionality?
04:13 - I want to have the look and feel of it for me design and the look and feel things really motivate me
04:19 - I get really motivated by
04:21 - Seeing something beautiful. So that's something that I really want to accomplish with this application and then drawing some rough sketches
04:28 - And then I try to put together just like the HTML skeleton for it sells it here's the header. Here's the
04:35 - Body user Subheaders. Here's the different boxes where these?
04:40 - Metrics will go, and I had like a side navigation, so I started floating the basic HTML together?
04:46 - Then I added a bunch of CSS for the visual stuff and making it look pretty
04:51 - And then lastly I was able to go on to add Javascript, so the core thing is I started very simple
04:57 - I knew I just wanted a single page. I didn't want to have to deal with
05:01 - Routers and all that I had no servers back-end. It was all just front-end and Javascript HTML and CSS and
05:09 - Once I got this version out then I started to kind of layer on other stuff
05:14 - So I want to learn how service work
05:16 - And I wanted to I was holding a lot of their logic in the data in the front-end
05:21 - and I want to really store that and have a server handle a lot of this logic and data and
05:25 - So what I did was I learned node. I went through a few tutorials and
05:31 - went through the documentation
05:32 - And then I figured out just like with a lot of fiddling and learned how to add a node server
05:37 - And it got that node server working, and I remember the moment that I got working I was like oh my God
05:41 - This is awesome, and then next up was I learn how to build an api, right?
05:46 - so I had a simple router and I built an api and then I figured out how to get the
05:51 - Front-end to talk to the Api and
05:54 - That was like a big moment for me, and then I was like okay. I'm storing a lot of my
05:59 - Definitions and data on in like a local file
06:02 - I want to move this to a database, so then I went through a bunch of tutorials to learn my sequel
06:07 - I learned my sequel, and then I learned how to set up a my sequel server with node and
06:13 - Plug those together and got those to talking to each other and that was like another aha moment and over time
06:20 - I just kind of continue to add more and more complexity and I even sure to add an additional
06:25 - Page the Front-end so that required me to learn how to use a router and how to navigate between those two pages
06:31 - And so that was kind of like the full stack process for how I got this goes back application running
06:37 - And then I also learned a little bit of basic testing after that because I've heard the testing is good
06:42 - And I really wanted to get in the habit of doing TDd. So I learned about testing and added tests
06:49 - And then finally got this application running locally
06:53 - the overall Key Was
06:55 - Just to get a basic web application running to keep it manageable right it took me about a week to get the initial
07:02 - MVp of the front when I'm working and another week to get the backend working because as
07:07 - Not only I did have to get working
07:08 - but I had to learn all this stuff on my own and
07:11 - then the last step was to actually learn how to deploy this so that I can share with my
07:15 - Friends or my sister or whatnot and so what I was like doing was I was doing much like googling to understand how to like
07:23 - Deploy a Web application and
07:25 - I read a bunch of tutorials on go to Roku and digitalocean and I want to be super Fancy
07:31 - I want to be legit, so I think I'm going to deploy with you. They do digitalocean and frankly
07:35 - It was a little bit too complicated for me at that stage
07:38 - I couldn't really understand everything that was going on in some residual digitalocean documentation and everything I
07:45 - Was still just like putting things together? It was a little bit hazy
07:48 - so I was like you know what I'm just going to scratch this and
07:51 - I'm going to use heroku which was like. You know it took me like half an hour to deploy in heroku
07:55 - It was like simple, and then you know later on as I got better
07:58 - I was back, and I learned how to use digital ocean and much more complicated deployment processes
08:03 - But I want the lesson I learned there was like when you're beginning
08:07 - You kind of get all like shiny object syndrome
08:09 - And you want to use all these sophisticated tools that you hear about and and stuff but I would just say start with the basics
08:15 - Get things working and so the simpler the better and really the goal is always just to finish and not make it too complex where?
08:22 - You get like so frustrated and just like never finish and give up
08:26 - So yeah, I remember when I deployed it my like eyes lit up
08:29 - and I was like it was the best feeling ever I was putting the link to all my friends and my boyfriend my sister and
08:34 - Everything and it really gave me the motivation to keep going
08:38 - Whereas if I had started with this big
08:41 - Ambitious project, I honestly probably would not have ever finished and I was just given up
08:46 - 1/3 of the way through or something but with the accomplishment of getting through each layer each step along the way. I just
08:53 - Motivated enough to kind of finish
08:58 - Another thing that I do when that when I was in that stage of like, okay, I know a lot of things
09:02 - But I don't know what to do next is I would learn from other people by reading other people's code
09:08 - So whether that's open source repos or examples that you find online like I know the react and redux repos for example
09:15 - Have a lot of examples of sample applications
09:18 - I would kind of read through those and really try to understand how people think through
09:22 - putting different parts of the application together
09:24 - And honestly I would copy a lot of the parts of the code that I thought was useful or that I liked or like their
09:31 - programming style
09:32 - And honestly it's totally okay to copy when you're learning
09:35 - This is how a lot of us learn even some of the best programmers that I know today that are like
09:40 - Kernel Developers at Google
09:42 - they started off by
09:43 - Copying other people's code and just like playing around with it and like changing some parts and learning how that works and so forth
09:49 - So it's okay to learn from other people's code and copy it as a beginner and then over time as you get better
09:55 - It's hard to write just as good code if you practice more and more
10:00 - and
10:02 - Another recommendation that says don't get stuck forever
10:05 - If you are if you ever get stuck as you're trying to build your first second or third, or whenever web application
10:11 - Then make sure you have like a process for how you go about debugging this stuff, right?
10:16 - First like look at the problem that you're running into and really think about it
10:20 - What what could be causing it like write it down maybe and like think about all the possible ideas you have for what could be causing?
10:26 - this this really forces you to think about the problem and
10:30 - Next time you run into this you'll know like oh, hi, remember this because I wrote it down
10:34 - And I I remember thinking through how to solve this problem
10:36 - and it'll be much easier to solve the next time and
10:39 - Then other things are like learn to use the chrome debugger in the web app like I mean that's a huge lifesaver a no-brainer
10:45 - and
10:47 - learn to use the internet I often find so many beginners who just like get stuck and really just don't use the internet enough and
10:54 - I'm honestly there's so many answers online just learn from other people there's people have run into you
10:59 - There's 99 likely, 99 percent likely chance  that someone has run into the problem
11:03 - You're running into especially if you're a beginner and building pretty simple and basic to leverage them leverage the internet
11:10 - And if you really can't come to any answers
11:14 - Asking opens open those communities or free in the free code camp communities ask on Stack overflow
11:21 - Ask someone else try try to find someone that you can ask so in conclusion
11:26 - there's really no simple answer to
11:28 - Ok what do I do next? How do I get to the next step how do I become a better developer?
11:32 - I learned all the basics
11:34 - instead
11:35 - Depending on your skills and depending on how much you're willing to learn and what your initial goals for learning to
11:42 - Program was just pick a project
11:45 - and build something and start small, I'm slowly slowly layer up, and I would say if
11:54 - You've kind of done this process, and you made it through building your first application. You want to go even deeper
12:00 - One thing that I did was I would do I try to I started researching like Javascript books
12:05 - good books that explain like basic computer science concepts or design patterns and really read through those and then try to be building your
12:13 - applications once you've kind of learned some of these new
12:16 - Concepts because it used to see how how much better you're getting day-By-day and week-By-week
12:21 - By the week as you learn your things
12:24 - And look your you know as you're kind of going through this process
12:28 - Which is one of the hardest parts of going from like a beginner to like an advanced beginner kind of stage?
12:33 - You'll hit a lot of oh my God this sucks so much
12:37 - I want to give up moments, but you'll also have those moments. Who are like you're like. Oh, wow this is so amazing
12:42 - I don't want to put this down and so every time you have that shitty moment where you're like
12:48 - Oh, I don't want to do this. This is really frustrating and getting stuck. I feel dumb
12:52 - Think about all those awesome moments
12:54 - You're going to have and really let those motivate you because honestly
12:58 - programming is really about this couple of
13:01 - Amazing moments you have that are just like you don't want to give those up for the for for the world?
13:06 - But you have to put up with a lot a lot of shitty stuff
13:09 - Along the way to get those but it's totally worth it because the feeling of like building something it is unbelievable
13:16 - and I'm addicted to it now and I hope that
13:19 - by building your first or second or third web application you will get addicted to that feeling -
13:25 - I think that's it for this one, and I hope you enjoyed it
