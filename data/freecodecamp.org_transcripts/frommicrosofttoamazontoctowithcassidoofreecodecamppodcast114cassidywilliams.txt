00:03 - [Music]
00:26 - welcome back to the free Cod Camp
00:28 - podcast each week we talk with
00:30 - developers entrepreneurs and ambitious
00:33 - people who are getting into Tech this
00:34 - week I'm joined by Cassidy Williams AKA
00:39 - cassid do Hello thank you for having me
00:43 - yeah we're thrilled to have you here
00:44 - cassid where does that name come from
00:46 - that's your handle on Twitter and Tik
00:48 - Tok and all the things uh it came from
00:51 - my mom actually she would say like how
00:53 - do you do cassad do and I picked it as a
00:56 - username in college and it just kind of
00:57 - stuck everywhere awesome awesome yeah
01:00 - and everywhere indeed that's one of the
01:02 - things I want to just start off by
01:03 - talking about like how you are
01:06 - ubiquities I can't really even think of
01:08 - any developers who are on more platforms
01:11 - and and like putting out more stuff than
01:14 - you so just some quick background on
01:16 - Cassidy she's been a developer for more
01:19 - than a decade she's worked at tons of
01:21 - big companies she's worked at lots of
01:22 - small companies as well she's currently
01:24 - the CTO of a tech startup uh so yeah
01:29 - let's talk about all these places you
01:31 - are so you I guess my first exposure to
01:34 - you was maybe like four or five years
01:36 - ago like watching the short kind of Tik
01:38 - Tok videos and hearing about this
01:40 - developer who was like Making Waves on
01:42 - Tik Tok on the talk right I don't use
01:45 - Tik Tok myself uh I watch Like These two
01:47 - or three hour long video essays on
01:49 - YouTube and stuff but uh certainly a lot
01:52 - of people were sharing it and it was
01:53 - also making its way onto Twitter and
01:55 - like Reddit and places like that that I
01:56 - would normally see it so maybe you can
01:59 - talk about like content creation and
02:02 - like how you became so prolific with
02:04 - your crazy you know Dad joke humor my
02:08 - memes yeah your memes yeah yeah and so I
02:12 - feel like I always made memes but Tik
02:14 - Tok just made it easier to make more um
02:17 - where I I even loved making videos a ton
02:21 - just when I was young but video editing
02:23 - takes time uh as you probably know and
02:25 - so I I kind of stopped but it was always
02:28 - like a fun thing that I did um and then
02:32 - yeah when I when I got Tic Tac I was
02:33 - like wow this editor is so easy and I
02:35 - just started recording silly ones that I
02:38 - had ideas for back in I think it was
02:40 - like mid 2019 when I started and things
02:43 - kind of exploded from there I never
02:44 - intended to be a content creator it was
02:46 - just kind of me joking around about the
02:49 - state of development and went from there
02:52 - yeah so maybe talking a little bit about
02:54 - content Creation in general like what
02:57 - are some of the
03:00 - cassid do memes that people may have
03:02 - seen like the the short videos like is
03:04 - there one that it just like completely
03:06 - blew up that you were like wow like I
03:09 - had no idea this many people would
03:11 - appreciate this developer humor yeah I
03:14 - think this was like the second or third
03:16 - one I made where it was me singing the
03:19 - song Impossible from a Cinderella movie
03:22 - where it's just someone repeating
03:24 - impossible a bunch of times and it's
03:25 - when your code works on the first try
03:28 - and it was just a bunch of people going
03:29 - like impossible impossible and it just
03:32 - keeps repeating it and it's true because
03:35 - you should always be suspicious if your
03:37 - code just works on the first try it's
03:39 - also you're also like o I'm a genius but
03:41 - also I'm probably not what's going on um
03:44 - so I think that one related a lot and
03:46 - then I also uh I do a Halloween Tik Tok
03:50 - every year where I admit I don't make as
03:52 - many as I do as I did before because I
03:55 - just have less time but I still always
03:57 - do one on Halloween where I do a CSS
04:00 - trick and I hide the word boo somewhere
04:03 - in the Tik Tok at some point and uh as
04:07 - you do the CSS trick the word boo
04:09 - appears and I scream at the end that
04:11 - that one I feel like a lot of people
04:13 - they're just like I look forward to this
04:14 - one every year because I can't figure
04:16 - out what it is until I see it and so
04:18 - that one's pretty fun too yeah
04:20 - interesting so you kind of like
04:23 - recurring uh themes and Rec even like
04:26 - recurring kind of inside jokes from the
04:28 - cassid C
04:30 - Universe yeah there there's some where I
04:32 - definitely it's like such a specific
04:35 - joke where I'm just like hm there's
04:36 - maybe 10 people in the world who will
04:38 - actually get this joke but it's funny to
04:40 - me so I'm going to do it anyway where
04:42 - like one of them was very specifically a
04:44 - reference to the Dream Girls Musical and
04:46 - then if you know that Musical and the
04:49 - lyrics that I am singing in there and
04:51 - you know react and how the use effect
04:53 - hook works it's a really funny joke and
04:57 - it like combines the two of them but
04:59 - yeah there the people who got it they're
05:01 - like oh my gosh this is so specific but
05:03 - this is hilarious and then everyone else
05:04 - is
05:05 - like good
05:07 - job you know that the definitely a lot
05:11 - of them are Hit or Miss but it's it's
05:12 - fun to just kind of laugh at a very
05:14 - serious industry sometimes like as a
05:17 - very amateurish dad joke and I only do
05:19 - it among family you're not going to see
05:21 - me trying to crack dad jokes generally
05:23 - in like the free C Camp newsletter or on
05:25 - the free C Camp podcast or right
05:27 - anywhere where you get your weekly do
05:29 - Quincy Larson right um I am very scared
05:33 - of just like getting the Crickets effect
05:35 - because I was like too many references
05:37 - deep and like at what point does a joke
05:39 - become too esoteric and you're like I
05:42 - really don't have confidence that this
05:44 - is going to land with even like one out
05:46 - of every 10 people that like do you have
05:49 - like some heuristics that you use when I
05:51 - just make the joke anyway cuz if I'm
05:54 - laughing at it I know that I can have a
05:56 - good time and and like there there's
05:59 - some specific people who like my husband
06:01 - or my sister or something they will all
06:03 - they will always be just like oh my gosh
06:05 - that was dumb but I know exactly what
06:06 - you're referencing and so like I I I've
06:09 - got a few people in in my back pocket
06:11 - where I can be like you'll laugh at this
06:13 - and then most people where they're just
06:14 - like no Cassidy I'm okay with that I
06:17 - just kind of make the joke anyway yeah
06:19 - so to some extent like you can be your
06:21 - own barometer of relevance and trust
06:24 - that your life is experience is
06:26 - overlapped with enough other people that
06:28 - like you know you've got some audience
06:31 - out there that is going to appreciate it
06:33 - and sometimes like the most geeky if I
06:36 - can use that term like of humor it
06:39 - brings people together who feel like I
06:41 - thought I was the only one who was
06:43 - interested in Doctor Who and right or
06:46 - who had this experience or something
06:48 - like that yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly or
06:51 - like greatest showman in typescript or
06:53 - something like that like yeah you you
06:56 - never know who it might work for and at
06:58 - the same time if anything future me will
07:01 - laugh at the joke and so I I make the
07:03 - joke anyway awesome yeah that's a great
07:06 - Philosophy for being is just like I have
07:09 - faith that other people are going to be
07:12 - similar enough to me in some specific
07:14 - way that like it'll it'll work
07:17 - out I want to talk so I mean there's so
07:20 - many things we can talk about because
07:21 - there's just so many interesting
07:22 - Dimensions to you uh but one thing that
07:25 - is really interesting is just the extent
07:28 - to which you put yourself out there
07:30 - there are plenty of people who got a CS
07:32 - degree a computer science degree from
07:33 - like a good Public University here in
07:35 - the US and got good jobs at developers
07:38 - maybe got an uh internship in Microsoft
07:41 - right those coveted internships in big
07:44 - Tech that you got as a university
07:46 - student and they're just like cool I'm
07:49 - set I can write my own ticket I can get
07:51 - on the train and
07:53 - just enjoy my hobbies and work you know
07:56 - a reasonable amount of work and you know
07:58 - eventually retire and I can just be a
08:00 - professional Dev like I I suspect a lot
08:03 - of people go into like Fields like
08:04 - Dentistry or medicine or maybe even law
08:07 - just because they are remunerative
08:09 - stable careers where people are always
08:11 - going to have cavities you know like
08:14 - dentist are not going to go yeah yeah
08:16 - they'll always have teeth maybe they
08:17 - won't always have cavities but get the
08:20 - nanites in there cleaning the teeth for
08:21 - us but
08:23 - um a lot of people choose CS precisely
08:26 - because it's a stable income if they're
08:28 - like a first generation American or
08:30 - second generation and and they've got a
08:31 - lot of family to take care of like yeah
08:34 - uh for example a significant chunk of
08:36 - the Indian economy historically has been
08:38 - doctors Engineers people that are living
08:41 - in the United States who are making a
08:42 - lot of money and then remitting a lot of
08:44 - that back to their families their
08:46 - extended families I'm married to an
08:48 - immigrant so that's very real yeah I am
08:52 - too uh my wife uh uh she actually
08:55 - immigrated after we met in graduate
08:57 - school and we got married
08:59 - uh almost 20 years ago and then we moved
09:02 - back to the us and we went through the
09:03 - lengthy Green Card process and then the
09:06 - naturalization process she's a US
09:08 - citizen today uh but but yeah
09:11 - like I could totally understand if
09:13 - you're coming from that perspective of
09:15 - you didn't grow up you know middle class
09:18 - in like New York City or Los Angeles or
09:20 - something and you don't really have a
09:21 - lot to fall back on just getting a safe
09:23 - career like frankly being a developer is
09:26 - basically the safest career you can get
09:28 - in this sense that like I always like to
09:31 - say the Act of automating things is the
09:34 - last thing that will be completely
09:35 - automated and software Engineers are
09:37 - doing the automation so by definition
09:39 - like they'll be that's the last job that
09:41 - will ever exist probably right um but
09:44 - you have not rested on your laurels and
09:47 - you have not just checked out and just
09:49 - focused on you know living the good life
09:51 - and and making a lot of money as a
09:52 - developer and having cool creative you
09:54 - know self-actualizing work you've gone
09:57 - out there and you know put your
09:59 - reputation and like all this stuff on
10:01 - the line by attempting to make funny
10:03 - jokes on the internet where people might
10:05 - be mean to you
10:07 - right yeah what what drove you to do
10:10 - that so it wasn't so much me just being
10:14 - like I'm going to be funny and who cares
10:16 - what people say I think it was more just
10:20 - I a lot of the stuff that I do put out
10:23 - there I want to make Tech more
10:25 - accessible in general and so like I have
10:27 - a Weekly Newsletter and every single
10:29 - week I share like weekly links and a
10:32 - practice coding question and with the
10:34 - jokes I want Tech to not be as scary
10:37 - because honestly it's a very very
10:39 - serious industry that like you deal with
10:41 - certain bugs and you might think I'm the
10:43 - only one who's dealt with this and
10:45 - you're not like whe whether it's the
10:47 - paranoia of your manager calling you
10:49 - into a meeting or just your code not
10:52 - working on the first try or you suddenly
10:54 - saying like oh I I'll never be
10:56 - interested in some language and then you
10:58 - try it you're like wait I am it's
11:00 - amazing and and there there there's so
11:02 - many different things where uh I think
11:05 - especially in the pandemic so many
11:07 - people were very very isolated and uh a
11:10 - lot of the work that I've done it
11:12 - started pre- pandemic but continued and
11:14 - and I went a bit harder on it to try to
11:17 - provide resources to people that I wish
11:18 - I had when I was learning yeah so that
11:21 - that's a big idus is like I want to make
11:24 - sure people have resources that I wish I
11:26 - had when I was
11:27 - learning yeah I mean it's very similar
11:30 - to free obviously like I learned code
11:32 - you can probably relate yeah um so was
11:36 - that the main reason is just like
11:38 - because a lot of the things you're doing
11:40 - like you're putting out learning
11:41 - resources and you know I would consider
11:43 - you an educator even though it sounds
11:44 - like you're mainly like an I mean you're
11:46 - I guess uh you worked in developer
11:49 - myself as an educator too so yeah yeah
11:54 - so I guess what were your roots in
11:58 - wanting to do that of course you start
11:59 - with this abstract goal I want to make
12:01 - it easier for people who are going
12:03 - through a journey similar to my own what
12:06 - what were the early days of content
12:08 - creation Cassidy like yeah content
12:11 - creation Cassidy who is she um I first
12:16 - started let's let me think I guess when
12:18 - I was in college I that's when I started
12:21 - doing things like uh being a TA for
12:25 - people or or a peer mentor for for
12:27 - people when I say ta teacher assistant
12:29 - and kind of just helping other students
12:31 - and stuff and um even earlier than that
12:35 - uh I we're going way back in high school
12:37 - when I was first getting interested in
12:40 - coding and stuff and there was no free
12:42 - code camp or anything like that at that
12:44 - point for me where I was just kind of
12:46 - like blindly trying to code uh and learn
12:48 - things I got involved with an
12:49 - organization called ncwit the national
12:52 - Center for Women and it and they were so
12:55 - helpful not so much to be just like this
12:58 - is how you code but like they got me
13:00 - connected to a lot of people who are so
13:01 - helpful to be just like this is
13:03 - something you should know or or like
13:04 - this is this is a thing that you should
13:06 - talk about or this is a thing that you
13:08 - should remember um just mentors even if
13:12 - it was just a a one hour mentorship
13:15 - session or or just something in passing
13:18 - and I think just being engaged with them
13:22 - from an early age just because I truly
13:25 - randomly saw their website and I was
13:27 - like I should try to apply for a SC
13:29 - um it it kind of just snowballed from
13:32 - there where uh one of the mentors that I
13:35 - had said lift as you climb where just as
13:37 - you move up in the industry you should
13:39 - try to lift other others up with you um
13:42 - and because as you move up in your role
13:45 - or somewhere there's going to be someone
13:47 - filling in the space behind you at all
13:49 - times and and it just benefits everyone
13:52 - over time um and yeah I think that was
13:54 - just something that hit me hard early
13:57 - and I kind of just rolled with it where
14:00 - after being super involved in high
14:02 - school and in college with NC Wht and I
14:03 - still am to this day not as much as I
14:06 - used to be but I do like resume
14:08 - workshops with them and stuff um it it
14:12 - just kind of snowballed where I was like
14:14 - oh well now that I'm in college I can
14:15 - give talks to high school students so
14:17 - that way they know like what to major in
14:18 - in college and I wrote blogs for my
14:21 - college to on like what the computer
14:23 - science major is like and then I started
14:27 - to like do aot of networking and meeting
14:29 - with people especially at internships
14:31 - and stuff in college and then from there
14:34 - as I got to see people in the industry
14:37 - before graduating I saw so many people
14:39 - where they were coding but they weren't
14:41 - just coding and I was like you know I
14:43 - like the idea of coding but not just
14:45 - coding and seeing what that could be and
14:47 - that led me to start doing Dev advocacy
14:49 - and stuff and the again it kind of just
14:52 - snowball where from there I was just
14:54 - like okay I'll go to hackathons and be a
14:55 - mentor okay and then from there I'll
14:57 - speak at conference and maybe teach some
14:59 - people things and then I started
15:02 - teaching online classes and I first
15:04 - started my newsletter because I thought
15:06 - oh I could teach people on the side of
15:08 - my online classes promote my online
15:09 - classes but then also help people out
15:11 - and so it just kind of kept growing over
15:14 - time where it it started with people
15:16 - helping me and then me realizing I
15:18 - should help others as well wow yeah it
15:22 - it sounds like you had uh a lot of
15:24 - people that were very inspiring to you
15:27 - and that you got hooked up early on with
15:29 - people who were kind of in your corner
15:31 - and could relate to a lot of the
15:33 - challenges you were facing and uh that I
15:37 - love what you said like lift as you
15:38 - climb that's such an amazing like I mean
15:41 - makes sense from like a rock climbing
15:42 - thing like you might have two people
15:43 - that are tethered together and like so
15:46 - you you climb up and and they're there
15:48 - to like help you in case you fall like
15:50 - they're provide some security because
15:52 - they're also connected to the wall and
15:53 - stuff I mean I've never
15:57 - G
15:59 - there's so many people where they
16:00 - probably don't realize the impact that
16:02 - they had on me where it was just like
16:05 - one person was an upper classman just at
16:07 - my school where where she was just
16:10 - helpful enough I was just like okay I'm
16:12 - going to listen to what she said and and
16:15 - the sometimes you never know like what
16:18 - small pieces of advice will hit and then
16:20 - carry you on and and that uh that kind
16:24 - of stuff I want to be able to provide
16:25 - advice that I wish I had um to as many
16:28 - people as I can yeah yeah and it sounds
16:31 - like you're reaching a lot of people
16:32 - just to put things in context like the
16:35 - degree of impact you're having uh not
16:37 - just as a developer not just as a CTO
16:39 - developer Advocate but creating courses
16:42 - teaching people how to code um you've
16:45 - got a ton of people of course watching
16:48 - your Tik Tok videos and by extension you
16:50 - know the videos are cross posted on
16:51 - Twitter I often see them like like
16:54 - you've got the pinned C locks oh yeah I
16:57 - encourage everybody to check out the the
16:59 - link to Cassidy's Twitter uh Cassidy's
17:02 - Twitter in the uh in the show notes
17:04 - because uh just checking out that one
17:06 - it's just you play all these different
17:08 - characters and and that's one of the
17:10 - things I don't know if that's like a Tik
17:11 - Tok thing but it'll be like one person
17:13 - playing like all these different roles
17:15 - and uh maybe they're wearing uh like a
17:17 - hat in one or they're wearing many wigs
17:20 - I I I think wigs are so fun and so I'm
17:22 - just like this is a good opportunity to
17:24 - just have a different hat yeah I mean
17:26 - it's it's like a campy way of so
17:28 - economizing like because you don't need
17:30 - to get more people involved you can
17:31 - really DIY it you can literally be this
17:34 - sole writer producer director actress
17:38 - like actor all all those different
17:40 - things in the show and you don't need
17:43 - really anybody's permission to do
17:45 - anything and then you just have like the
17:46 - editing tools you make it and then you
17:47 - you Syndicate it across all these
17:49 - different things of course you've got
17:50 - your newsletter that I'll like I enjoyed
17:53 - reading some of the back issues of it
17:54 - always includes a joke it's worth
17:56 - signing up just for the joke
17:59 - definitely just read it to scroll to the
18:01 - joke yeah yeah I mean at least they're
18:05 - reading it and getting some uh benefit
18:07 - from it yeah yeah hey if anything what's
18:10 - fun is I I used to only do Tech jokes or
18:13 - or like most of them would be Tech jokes
18:15 - but then a bunch of people started
18:16 - saying like thank you so much for these
18:17 - jokes I read it to my grandma every week
18:19 - and I'm just like oh my gosh I'm going
18:20 - to do non- Tech jokes so you can read
18:23 - more to your grandma but uh yeah the
18:26 - jokes are great yeah uh like free C Camp
18:29 - my email every week includes a quote of
18:31 - the week and and recently of course I
18:33 - quoted one of your quotes about like
18:35 - some joke you made about get and uh it
18:37 - it was something about like I don't want
18:40 - to misquote it do you remember I
18:41 - honestly I literally wrote a blog post
18:43 - about get like a half hour before this
18:46 - recording so it could be anything yeah
18:49 - there are lots of like uh puns that you
18:51 - can make around get especially because I
18:53 - I think like there's so many weird mixed
18:55 - analogies in get and so many of the
18:57 - commands it's like like how did you go
18:59 - like get blamed that was a real head
19:00 - scratcher like such a rude way blame
19:03 - someone yeah I I saw someone made like
19:05 - an alias where it was get props and it's
19:07 - the same thing as blame it just makes
19:09 - you feel a little better about it yeah
19:11 - the toxicity of tech is built right into
19:13 - the tools themselves blaming people
19:16 - though um yeah I uh so you also stream
19:21 - on Twitch and I'd be curious to learn I
19:23 - haven't actually watched any of your
19:25 - streams yet I'm hoping to catch them
19:26 - like I don't spend a lot I watch vods on
19:30 - um YouTube that people upload video on
19:32 - demand so I never watch I watch
19:34 - everything on YouTube like double speed
19:36 - it twitch it's just like onx is too slow
19:39 - for me like no offense if anybody here
19:41 - is like finding this conversation
19:42 - dragging a little bit just go and bump
19:44 - the speed a little bit and I promise
19:45 - it's like way more everything is more
19:47 - interesting at 2x um and I do that for
19:50 - all my podcasts like basically every
19:52 - piece of content my wife won't even
19:53 - watch movies with me anymore CU I double
19:55 - speed them um oh gosh movies too
19:58 - sometimes you know it depends on like if
20:00 - it's like you know like a a late night
20:02 - kind of like guilty pleasure like watch
20:04 - of some 8s or a really really really
20:07 - slow movies where it's like we're
20:09 - walking across the sand Blade the new
20:11 - Blade Runner one was slow as heck um it
20:13 - was a good movie but it was
20:15 - slow like man AB some respectful
20:18 - people's time I'm sure like all the the
20:20 - you know filmmakers in the audience are
20:22 - like crying don't you yeah but anyway I
20:26 - do stream yeah talk about that yeah so I
20:29 - and I admit I've slowed down a little
20:31 - bit because I had a baby and it's not as
20:33 - easy to live stream weekly but I've been
20:36 - trying to get back to my regular weekly
20:38 - Cadence of streaming and it kind of
20:40 - started where once again I I thought it
20:42 - might be useful to teach people
20:44 - something and then kind of talk about it
20:45 - and so typically what I would do when I
20:49 - first started streaming um myself I had
20:53 - streamed before like with my sister and
20:54 - stuff Tech things but um I I would talk
20:59 - for like a half hour to an hour about
21:01 - like whatever questions people had
21:03 - jobwise or or technical questions
21:06 - opinions about the latest hot new
21:08 - JavaScript library or something like
21:10 - that and then after that I'd go into
21:12 - some project that was like recurring
21:14 - weekly and everything and I admit I
21:16 - leaned more towards the first part
21:19 - because people were so they had so many
21:21 - questions um for a while until a lot of
21:23 - my stream ended up being mostly just
21:25 - like a Q&A session seeing what like what
21:27 - questions can answer for people or just
21:29 - hang out and co-work um but then yeah
21:32 - some other ones where it's I'll be like
21:34 - I really want to work on this library
21:35 - today so I'm just going to code and I'll
21:38 - check out the chat and see if yall have
21:39 - questions from there but yeah it's it's
21:41 - a very casual stream I I admit I should
21:44 - probably be more like consistent about
21:47 - it there have been times where I'm just
21:48 - like I'm not streaming this week because
21:49 - I have a really good sandwich here's a
21:51 - picture of it see you next week and so
21:53 - like it really just varies from from
21:56 - week to week but uh yeah it's it's fun
21:59 - to just kind of chat with people in the
22:00 - community especially once again it's a
22:03 - very remote World um especially uh post
22:06 - pandemic we're still kind of in it eh um
22:09 - and and being able to interact with
22:11 - people in the community yeah yeah so
22:14 - being out there especially like real
22:16 - time communicating with chat and uh as
22:19 - you're on stream like doing Q&A sessions
22:21 - or just live coding and answering
22:22 - people's questions as they fire them in
22:25 - uh I did stream for like a couple years
22:28 - years uh while I was building a lot of
22:30 - the early versions of free Cod camp but
22:32 - it just um I got some the same question
22:35 - so many times over and over I'm like I'm
22:37 - just going to write articles and writing
22:39 - articles like I I got a lot more I guess
22:41 - help helped a lot of people more a lot
22:44 - definitely I I have like an ask me
22:46 - anything repo on GitHub you can go to
22:48 - cast.
22:49 - run um I I have like an ask me anything
22:51 - repo where it's like frequently asked
22:53 - questions and then also yeah if I get a
22:55 - question repeatedly I'm just like okay
22:57 - I'll write a blog and then I can just
22:58 - kind of link it to people so I don't
22:59 - have to keep me saying it what questions
23:01 - do people ask I'm just curious like what
23:04 - would be the most asked question about
23:06 - you that is not specific to like how do
23:09 - I get you know fix get detached head or
23:11 - something but like not a technical
23:13 - question but just a question about you
23:15 - in general yeah um I should pull up my
23:18 - repo but uh let's see people often ask
23:21 - like startups versus big companies
23:23 - people often ask like should I get a
23:25 - computer science degree um they often
23:29 - ask what mechanical keyboard should I
23:31 - buy yeah uh what's it like being a woman
23:34 - in Tech
23:37 - uh should I write a cover letter for my
23:40 - job okay so practical uh you know yeah
23:43 - so so some some of them are practical
23:45 - some are very specific to my experience
23:48 - okay cool well we are going to talk
23:50 - about several of those things that just
23:52 - mention I can just link to this episode
23:54 - yeah mechanical keyboards something that
23:57 - you're interested in uh something that I
24:00 - I happen to have a mechanical keyboard I
24:01 - just use it when I'm on a PC and when um
24:04 - but I I have these little remote Mac
24:06 - ones like this because they're Compact
24:09 - and yeah chick you're like ah Sak
24:14 - blue no like like what is your interest
24:17 - in and how did they come about in
24:19 - mechanical keyboards it really just
24:22 - spiraled where I it started with me just
24:24 - wanting a pretty keyboard where I was
24:26 - just like my desk should be cuter and I
24:28 - always have just like a really boring
24:29 - looking keyboard and then I realized you
24:31 - could customize keyboards and then I
24:34 - just kind of took a nose dive deep into
24:37 - the entire keyboard Community where um
24:40 - there was a point I I lived in New York
24:42 - for several years and then moved to
24:43 - Seattle and I remember one of my
24:46 - co-workers that I was speaking to in New
24:48 - York right before moving he had the
24:50 - coolest keyboard and I just started
24:52 - asking questions like okay you 3D
24:54 - printed that and what switches are these
24:56 - what does this mean and so I just asked
24:57 - him a bunch of questions and then moving
24:59 - to Seattle Seattle is a hobbyist city
25:03 - I've said it before and I will always
25:05 - say this people are so into their
25:06 - hobbies in Seattle where and anything
25:10 - that you could be interested in you will
25:11 - find people interested in that where
25:13 - it's I admit it's kind of hard to make
25:15 - friends outside of of just the hobby but
25:18 - the hobby itself huge and so when I got
25:21 - to Seattle I just went in deep where I
25:23 - ended up being like on the board for
25:25 - nonprofit that taught kids Electronics
25:27 - via soldering mechanical keyboards and
25:29 - reran the Seattle mechanical keyboard
25:32 - Meetup that had like 3 to 400 people
25:34 - bringing their keyboards and that's a
25:36 - lot of people for a keyboard meet up my
25:37 - goodness like it was amazing and and
25:40 - like we had talks on like manufacturing
25:42 - and on stenography and and and so many
25:44 - cool things and and yeah I just kind of
25:46 - got really really deep and then I
25:48 - started designing keycaps because
25:50 - keyboards are expensive and I was just
25:52 - like if I design keycaps maybe I could
25:54 - get some free key caps so I'm not
25:55 - spending too much money that did not
25:58 - help me but hey some some of the key
26:02 - casts behind me I designed those ones I
26:05 - designed those ones I like it it just
26:08 - kind of became a fun thing where I just
26:10 - got really involved with this community
26:12 - that likes making things pretty and
26:15 - functional it's it's reminds me of just
26:17 - like Legos but with more electronics and
26:20 - it's very fun yeah I suppose as a
26:23 - developer you're kind of a crafts person
26:25 - and your tools of the trade your keybo
26:29 - right like that's that's how you kind of
26:30 - interface with the machine is uh and
26:34 - typing keyboards are never going to go
26:35 - out of style because you can type so
26:37 - efficiently and I love typing like
26:39 - whenever I need to think I open up a
26:41 - text editor I just start typing and and
26:43 - that's kind of like I use the pages kind
26:45 - of like an external brain for organizing
26:46 - my ideas I love typing uh what is it
26:50 - about typing and like keyboards that
26:52 - just you think get so many people to
26:54 - care about the kind of tool that they're
26:57 - using because you said it you had 400
26:59 - people in Seattle by the way I'm
27:01 - interested like this is the first time
27:03 - I've ever heard the notion of Seattle is
27:05 - a developer or like I'm sorry like a
27:07 - hobbyist city do you think that has
27:08 - something to do with like all the rain
27:09 - and people staying indoors more yes I
27:11 - 100% that that's exactly what it is I
27:14 - think people are just like well we can't
27:15 - go outside because it's so rainy I guess
27:17 - we're going to get really into this one
27:19 - specific thing I and and there might be
27:22 - some seattleites who disagree but I'm
27:25 - going based on a lot of experience and
27:27 - what I saw
27:28 - um and yeah anyway typing is just it's
27:32 - something that you do it's something fun
27:34 - and also I'm going to shill my startup a
27:36 - little bit to talk about thinking out
27:38 - things but anyway uh
27:40 - yeah when I type on a mechanical
27:43 - keyboard and depending on the different
27:45 - switches all of my keyboards have
27:46 - different switches and different feels
27:48 - and stuff it's it's just kind of fun
27:51 - because it feels different depending on
27:54 - the keyboard that you use and some
27:55 - keyboards make you feel more productive
27:56 - some some are more loud some are more
27:58 - quiet I'm using a quiet one now because
28:00 - whenever I do recordings I have a
28:02 - silenced keyboard because I don't want
28:03 - to be clack clack clack that kind of
28:05 - stuff and so it's it's just kind of fun
28:08 - to have different options and different
28:10 - feels as as you type and and some
28:13 - keyboards I genuinely just type faster
28:14 - on and so I can type at the speed of
28:17 - thought kind of like what you're were
28:18 - saying yeah I when it comes to just like
28:22 - whistling while you work kind of like
28:24 - you're you're going to spend so much
28:26 - time typing like I don't know how do you
28:27 - have any idea like how many key strokes
28:29 - you make on your average day have you
28:30 - ever tried tracking that or anything
28:31 - like that I haven't I should but there's
28:34 - a lot yeah I I imagine you're just
28:37 - constantly typing and like that little
28:39 - tactile feedback it's just like people
28:41 - get really into their cars and like like
28:44 - having the the feel of the car against
28:46 - like exactly how much it slides how it
28:48 - feels when you're accelerating or when
28:50 - you're Switching gears and stuff like I
28:51 - can imagine like developers get the same
28:53 - thing cuz you're kind of doing a lot of
28:55 - those cheaper than a car yeah yeah well
28:57 - how much would like a like a middling
29:00 - mechanical keyboard like a starter
29:02 - mechanical keyboard start you can start
29:04 - relatively cheap I I actually just
29:05 - helped a friend buy one who has never
29:08 - gotten a keyboard before and and I think
29:10 - it was like $40 and and it was it's a
29:12 - nice keyboard like that's going to last
29:14 - for a long time um it they get pricey I
29:18 - I've I've typed on keyboards like at
29:21 - these meetups where it's like oh this is
29:23 - a $3,000 keyboard you type it you're
29:26 - just like oh that's why this is nice but
29:29 - I don't $3,000 keyboard I don't I don't
29:32 - need to go that far but I get it yeah so
29:36 - if money is No Object and you want to
29:37 - have like the best feel then yeah people
29:41 - people spend a lot of money on their
29:43 - Hobbies right I I think that's a
29:44 - reasonable use of of funds uh so let's
29:48 - talk a little bit about uh your startup
29:50 - because you mentioned that you're you
29:52 - know you're CTO and you it's you have uh
29:56 - wall jump many times from company to
29:58 - company over the years and you're like
30:01 - really high up now you're basically it's
30:03 - the Pinnacle as a developer unless you
30:05 - want to go find your own company uh the
30:07 - the pinnac and a lot of Founders are CTO
30:09 - as well maybe you could talk a little
30:10 - bit about that and ideation and and just
30:13 - getting your thoughts down on paper yeah
30:17 - cont contenda is that what it's called
30:19 - contenda yeah but uh we we're in a
30:21 - pivoting stage so we're building an app
30:23 - called brain story and we're uh speaking
30:26 - getting ideas down on paper that's what
30:28 - brain story does so sh'll Break um what
30:32 - we do at uh on brain story is you just
30:35 - talk to your browser about an idea you
30:37 - have and it could be you could be
30:38 - brainstorming like a whole new side
30:40 - project a blog post a conference talk
30:43 - you could just be wanting to talk out
30:44 - while you want to prep for a podcast or
30:46 - a meeting and as you talk it helps guide
30:50 - you uh as you as you speak where I could
30:52 - I could say to brain I'll be just like
30:55 - okay I know I want to build this feature
30:56 - in a side project but I don't know what
30:58 - the UI should look like it just asks me
31:01 - questions like okay well what's the most
31:03 - important thing about this UI and it so
31:06 - it it uses AI but it's not generative AI
31:08 - it just talks back to you and forces you
31:10 - to talk and then as you talk out your
31:12 - ideas Eureka you get answers and so I
31:16 - use it to write and speak and do a lot
31:18 - of things so what you're telling me is
31:20 - I'm spending all this time prompting AI
31:23 - but AI could be prompting me exactly yes
31:27 - and and and yeah and and I think that's
31:29 - the main differentiator and that's why
31:31 - we're we're trying to gear it more
31:32 - towards like students and non-technical
31:35 - people because a lot of developers will
31:37 - be just like well I could just build
31:38 - this with GPT I'm just like kind of but
31:41 - it's once again you're not prompting the
31:43 - computer the computer's prompting you to
31:45 - speak it's it's we call it iterative AI
31:47 - instead of generative AI yeah um but
31:50 - anyway startup things I uh I've been
31:54 - with contenda for a long time for for
31:57 - about three years but I actually started
31:58 - as an adviser for them um and we can get
32:01 - into advisory things in a bit but um my
32:05 - CEO she was a part of my patreon group
32:08 - which I have a patreon where I can help
32:10 - people like with resume reviews and have
32:12 - a Discord group and stuff so just to
32:14 - give people some context like maybe they
32:15 - would subscribe and like pay you you
32:17 - know $1 a month and then if they're at
32:19 - the higher tier maybe they get like a a
32:22 - oneon-one call with you every month or
32:25 - something like that and yeah and so like
32:27 - cheapest one is literally the lowest
32:28 - tier that patreon will give me and it's
32:30 - $2 a month and that just gives you
32:32 - access to the Discord and having that
32:34 - little pay wall is really good for
32:36 - keeping spammers out and so that that's
32:38 - that's that one but then yeah if you do
32:40 - $15 a month I'll review your resume and
32:42 - so we'll all the community to like give
32:44 - you tips and then there's like an
32:46 - interview prep one where like I'll get
32:48 - on one-on-one calls with you for as long
32:49 - as you do it to help interview prep with
32:52 - you um so anyway that's that's what that
32:54 - is and so anyway my CE she was a part of
32:58 - this patreon and she was just playing
33:00 - video games and kind of chilling in the
33:01 - group and she noticed that I was mailing
33:03 - stickers to everybody in the group by
33:05 - hand which took a lot of time and um she
33:09 - said hey if I build something that helps
33:11 - you mail stickers to people would you
33:13 - use it and I said yes cuz I'm getting a
33:15 - hand cramp from writing envelopes um and
33:18 - so she built a tool that we now call
33:21 - contenna which which mailed stickers to
33:24 - people and it did so well it actually
33:27 - helped lewig on Twitch break the world
33:28 - record for the most number of
33:30 - subscribers um which was cool but
33:32 - stickers don't really like Venture scale
33:35 - and so it she I I was an adviser at that
33:39 - point trying to like give tips as she
33:41 - was kind of working on this and then uh
33:43 - she had founding Engineers to help out
33:45 - and they ended up building tools for
33:46 - like helping you retain subscribers as a
33:49 - Creator and then eventually before the
33:51 - gpts came out it was transforming
33:53 - content where you could say like turn
33:55 - this podcast into a Blog post or turn
33:57 - these videos into tweets or something um
34:00 - and then the gpts came out
34:02 - and all of a sudden everybody knew about
34:04 - Ai and so there's so many pivots in
34:06 - there to try to be just like here's how
34:08 - we're different here's how you could do
34:10 - this but um because Chad gbt and all
34:12 - these tools came out the differentiating
34:15 - factors were getting Slimmer and Slimmer
34:17 - and so we were pivoting more and more
34:19 - again um and we had a developer API and
34:22 - in this time I joined as CTO um and so I
34:25 - I've been I've been full time as CTO for
34:28 - over a year now year and a
34:31 - halfish time isn't real but
34:33 - anyway not after the pandemic yeah
34:37 - seriously though it's it's wild um but
34:39 - anyway we had a developer API with our
34:42 - previous product and we thought oh let's
34:44 - build just like mini apps on top of our
34:46 - Dev API and see what could work and we
34:49 - had built this tool that we designed to
34:51 - help high school students write college
34:53 - essays um where it wouldn't write the
34:55 - essay for them but they could could just
34:57 - talk out like essay questions um and
35:00 - figure out like how they might want to
35:02 - frame their essay and it worked so well
35:04 - we were like wait a minute this could
35:05 - apply to others too and so we we thus
35:08 - brain story was born and it's just helps
35:11 - you talk out your ideas for anything and
35:14 - people have used it to plan D and D
35:16 - campaigns some people use it to like
35:18 - write literal like standup comedy sets
35:21 - um there's a big like contingent of like
35:23 - sports psychology like improving your
35:25 - mindset around certain by just talking
35:27 - it out performance Coes yeah yeah ex
35:30 - which is really just therapy but it's
35:32 - like therapy for professionals yeah
35:35 - exactly uh honestly there there was one
35:37 - user that where we were doing like a
35:39 - user test and she said I think this
35:40 - knows me better than my therapist we're
35:42 - like no this isn't a therapist we don't
35:44 - want that legal burden but uh that's
35:46 - what brain story is and and it's been
35:48 - really fun to work on very cool it is
35:50 - cool like you know just to give context
35:53 - if anyone hasn't heard the term pivot
35:54 - like a lot of times startups early on
35:56 - they everybody's trying to get traction
35:58 - right they trying to get a whole lot of
36:01 - people to you know essentially like use
36:04 - their product or you know better yet
36:05 - give them money so that they can go and
36:08 - they can get more funding and they can
36:09 - expand and you know do all these things
36:11 - that that startups do and uh so a pivot
36:14 - is just generally where you completely
36:16 - change your product or maybe it could be
36:18 - a smaller pivot like instead of doing
36:21 - like something in the same space you you
36:23 - your solution is slightly different you
36:25 - take a different approach AI caus a lot
36:27 - of companies to Pivot over the past few
36:29 - years uh and uh you know it also costs
36:33 - companies like Che that like you know
36:36 - would help people with their uh their
36:40 - homework and stuff uh you don't need to
36:43 - pay for you know answers to test
36:46 - questions and stuff like that so you can
36:47 - cheat on your test if you got like
36:49 - something like uh a foundational llm
36:52 - that can like help you just answer all
36:54 - the questions real quick and like teach
36:55 - you that stuff right so
36:57 - um yeah it's been quite tumultuous uh
36:59 - but I'm glad to hear that you all have
37:01 - been able to actually not only pay it
37:03 - but also incorporate some similar
37:06 - approaches even if you're not using like
37:07 - an llm per se uh I'm not sure do you do
37:10 - you all use llms at all yeah we we do
37:12 - some under the hood we we've done so
37:15 - many things custom where we're like now
37:17 - we're just like dang GPT makes this easy
37:19 - and so there we we uh do have some gupt
37:22 - stuff under the hood but a lot of it
37:24 - we've we've built in housee yeah and
37:26 - just to be like I have a policy like on
37:28 - the podcast I always explain acronyms
37:30 - even though I've said it probably a many
37:31 - times llm large language model uh gp4
37:35 - being uh probably the most popular large
37:37 - language model so um and spoiler alert
37:41 - we we do have an interview with uh the
37:44 - first developer Advocate uh at open aai
37:48 - uh and she and I are neighbors we were
37:50 - just talking recently we're like so we
37:52 - live less than 10 minutes apart Chicago
37:55 - Connection wow Patrick being the person
37:57 - we're talking about yeah
37:59 - um you've lived in so many cities I know
38:01 - this is like a really bad transition
38:03 - you've lived in so many cities like so
38:05 - you grew up in Chicago then you moved uh
38:08 - to Ohio to go to Ohio say Iowa I always
38:12 - get those four letter O names mixed up
38:14 - Iowa State uh and then while you were
38:17 - there you of course got your CS degree
38:18 - and you've lived in like where what are
38:20 - other major cities of a bunch of cities
38:23 - yeah so so I've lived I yeah moved to
38:27 - Iowa for school and then for my
38:29 - internships I lived in Minneapolis
38:30 - Seattle and then the San Francisco Bay
38:32 - Area um I also lived in Spain for a good
38:35 - chunk of time for studying abroad and
38:38 - loved it that was amazing everybody
38:39 - should study abroad if they have the
38:40 - opportunity it's it's so great and I've
38:42 - gone back to Spain so many times since
38:44 - like it it I've maintained friendships
38:46 - there H it was the best um and then I
38:50 - lived in New York City after graduation
38:52 - for three years three or four years you
38:55 - lived in like every major city except
38:56 - for Dallas pretty much and then and then
38:58 - I lived in I lived in Seattle after that
39:00 - and then in the pandemic moved back to
39:02 - Chicago yeah wow so you you've like hit
39:06 - basically every major city and one of
39:08 - the things that is that really intrigues
39:10 - me about your career this past decade
39:13 - plus that you've been working in Tech is
39:15 - that you've changed jobs a lot and
39:19 - there's conventional wisdom that like oh
39:21 - you get a job and you keep it for at
39:23 - least two years you don't have gaps you
39:25 - don't have uh you know you don't want to
39:27 - have to explain your your job changes to
39:30 - uh some HR person because it's an
39:32 - awkward conversation but um you know did
39:35 - they quietly push you out and then you
39:37 - just resigned and made it look like you
39:39 - Chang jobs or like there's always that
39:40 - suspicion like looming over like why
39:42 - this person keeps changing jobs are they
39:43 - just not a good fit or are they overly
39:46 - careerist and they're just trying to
39:48 - ascend the ladder as quickly as possible
39:50 - like why have you changed job so much
39:54 - and like and what do you think are the
39:57 - stigmas around that and do you think
39:58 - they're warranted yeah yeah I think
40:01 - there are stigmas around it and and for
40:03 - some of them yes like I will say if you
40:06 - see a bunch of people work I I've talked
40:08 - to people I'm just like all of your jobs
40:10 - have been like two months or less that's
40:13 - very short I I try to I try to stay a
40:16 - little bit longer at places and I never
40:18 - go into a job thinking like I'm going to
40:20 - be out of here in a year I I always try
40:22 - to to stay as long as possible but just
40:24 - life happens and I think just as an
40:27 - aside it's really good to do like life
40:30 - audits to be like are you going in the
40:32 - direction where you want to be going um
40:34 - and is your job stopping you from doing
40:36 - that um and so after college I went to
40:38 - venmo and I was a Dev Advocate there it
40:41 - was really fun I I was working on the
40:43 - product itself um I built blocking so if
40:45 - you ever block someone but no that was
40:47 - me um cool and then uh also how does
40:50 - that work you block people they can't
40:51 - send you money anymore or do people send
40:53 - you money like is there a messaging
40:55 - client or something
40:57 - well people would like be annoying
41:00 - people or harassing people by just
41:01 - sending one cent at a time with like
41:03 - annoying payment messages ah people
41:07 - people be annoying but anyway um so
41:10 - loved being at venmo it was a really
41:12 - really cool place to work they were
41:14 - bought out and um them right yeahp right
41:19 - yeah PayPal bought them and and this was
41:21 - before eBay and PayPal split and stuff
41:23 - and and they were actually bought by a
41:25 - company named Brain tree and PayPal
41:27 - bought them we jokingly called it ventry
41:30 - palb because it was venmo brain tree
41:31 - PayPal eBay and then like PayPal and
41:34 - eBay split while I was there chaotic
41:36 - time so a lot of chaos that was
41:38 - completely out of your control and and
41:40 - you just want to like work on product
41:42 - and yeah there's probably all kinds of
41:43 - org changes and like they ended up
41:46 - discontinuing the API and as a Dev
41:48 - Advocate what are you supposed to do if
41:50 - the API is going away like that kind of
41:53 - stuff and so I ended up leaving because
41:55 - like I was talking to fellow co-workers
41:58 - on like the brain tree and PayPal side
41:59 - and they're just like they're not going
42:00 - to be supporting you much longer if you
42:03 - have an opportunity you should probably
42:06 - get out of Dodge and so that's why I
42:07 - ended up leaving um yeah and and I'm so
42:09 - grateful to them they were they were
42:10 - really kind people who I still keep in
42:12 - touch with who were like looking out for
42:14 - me in that regard and um so anyway yeah
42:17 - I left that's not the only time your
42:18 - company that you've been working at has
42:20 - been acquired right like is that
42:22 - happened another time that's yeah so
42:24 - that that's happened that happened again
42:25 - so after venmo I went to a company
42:27 - called clarify they're an AI startup um
42:30 - I think they're series C now they do
42:32 - cool like image recognition things I I
42:34 - loved working there too I actually
42:36 - worked with my sister there for a little
42:37 - bit of time before she went off to
42:39 - Google and um I moved and remote work
42:43 - wasn't as much of a thing then and so I
42:45 - was moving from New York to Seattle and
42:47 - that is what caused me to do that job
42:49 - change where just personal life things
42:52 - and so after that I went to a company
42:53 - called L4 L4 digital which was a
42:56 - creative Agency on Seattle Super loved
42:59 - that too it was also bought
43:01 - out and so that that one was bought out
43:04 - by a a large company based in Argentina
43:07 - called glent and um it was it was cool
43:10 - kind of being involved with them but uh
43:12 - they were very quickly changing a lot of
43:15 - the company culture and everything and
43:18 - and uh it it just it just wasn't the
43:21 - kind of environment that I was really
43:23 - wanting to stick a part of but I but I
43:24 - really enjoyed that job cuz I was an
43:26 - engineering manager there as well as
43:27 - just engineering on a bunch of cool
43:29 - client projects um but yeah eventually I
43:32 - was just like the I think I was there a
43:35 - little more than a year and a half but
43:37 - the large company changes were uh kind
43:41 - of messing with the the culture enough
43:43 - that I decided to go and then I went to
43:45 - Amazon which was a bad choice um for me
43:49 - I'm sure there are people who love their
43:50 - jobs at Amazon and are there for a long
43:52 - time but I knew like two weeks in that
43:55 - they pay very well but at what cost and
43:58 - it was like truly a golden handcuff
43:59 - situation and so I tried to stick it out
44:02 - but there came a point where I was just
44:04 - like the money is not worth it I'm
44:06 - really unhappy here um and so I quit
44:09 - after about seven months at Amazon and
44:11 - then went to Coden which was awesome
44:13 - yeah codepen amazing tool C is such a
44:16 - great tool yeah and I I still talk to
44:19 - those people to this day like literally
44:21 - yesterday um they're they're such a
44:23 - great team and I really loved working on
44:24 - codepen um building out features and
44:27 - stuff and it was just a straight up
44:29 - software engineering role not Dev
44:30 - advocacy or anything but as a result I
44:32 - was kind of missing the dev advocacy
44:34 - stuff um and so I would like still
44:37 - occasionally speak at conferences and
44:39 - and uh do more developer facing things
44:41 - and that was where I started doing the
44:43 - Tik Tock and and just started kind of
44:46 - doing more public things while also
44:47 - working on the product um but they
44:50 - needed they needed someone who's just
44:52 - software engineering who who wasn't
44:53 - doing the dev advocacy stuff and and uh
44:56 - are doing like the public speaking
44:58 - things and we we kind of tried to see if
45:00 - there was a balance there and and
45:02 - honestly there just wasn't there were
45:04 - just like we're so sorry but we can't
45:05 - really support like you going to
45:07 - conferences and stuff we need you to be
45:09 - engineering and um so we parted ways I I
45:13 - I was just like I love you guys but I'm
45:15 - going to go do something for developers
45:17 - because I really like the teaching
45:19 - aspect um and uh yeah the that one was a
45:23 - shame because I I really loved working
45:25 - at codepen I just wanted to be working
45:27 - with developers more and um so then I
45:30 - went and became a full-time teacher and
45:32 - so I I was teaching at a company called
45:34 - react training full-time and it was
45:37 - great I was I was traveling a ton and
45:39 - just giving workshops on how to write
45:41 - react better all the time um that is
45:44 - where I started live streaming a bit
45:45 - more on on the react side too it was
45:47 - great um and then the pandemic happened
45:51 - and uh at that I guess that puts a Kash
45:53 - on like a lot of the activity that you
45:55 - would have
45:56 - as a teacher if you're doing like
45:57 - inperson workshops and stuff it did yeah
45:59 - I was I was doing so much iners stuff
46:02 - that like I called 2020 in January I was
46:05 - like this is going to be my year of
46:06 - travel I'm going to do like a last Terra
46:08 - and then I'll stop and so like I went to
46:11 - Austria I went to Boston I went to SF I
46:13 - went to France I went to Ireland I I
46:15 - went to Hawaii I was traveling a ton
46:17 - just in January and February and then in
46:19 - early March I was coming back from
46:21 - Dublin I was going to be home for three
46:22 - days then go to Spain and then shut down
46:26 - and everything started shutting down
46:29 - and digital workshops weren't just
46:31 - simply weren't as much of a thing at
46:34 - that point people probably were less
46:35 - inclined to pay a lot of money companies
46:38 - were probably less inclined to send
46:40 - their employees to something that is
46:42 - just a virtual webinar type thing and so
46:44 - like within two weeks react training had
46:47 - to shut down cuz we just W two weeks
46:49 - well at least I mean kudos to them for
46:51 - rep recognizing the writing on the wall
46:54 - that this was going to be a big thing
46:56 - the biggest thing that's happened in our
46:58 - lifetime probably hopefully the biggest
46:59 - thing that will happen in our lifetime
47:01 - yeah it was it was wild and and it was
47:04 - such a shame too cuz we said at the
47:05 - beginning of March we're like we have so
47:07 - many workshops in March we just have to
47:08 - get through March and then we'll have
47:09 - runway for like two or three years and
47:12 - we couldn't get through March so um
47:14 - anyway that that that is what led me to
47:17 - leave react training because the company
47:19 - shut down and uh then I went to NFI
47:21 - after that and nlii was great I I was
47:24 - doing Dev advocacy on act in xjs there
47:27 - and had a blast and and I did that for
47:29 - for a while um and then after like
47:33 - almost two years I was just starting to
47:35 - burn out a ton because I moved up into
47:38 - management as like a director of Dev
47:40 - experience there and uh it was just it
47:42 - was so much work um but it was like a
47:45 - combination of doing the director work
47:47 - and the individual contributor work um
47:49 - where I was still like coding writing
47:52 - blog posts doing all these things but I
47:53 - was also in meetings like
47:56 - so so many meetings like 11 to 15
47:58 - meetings a day it was like like 10
48:02 - minute meetings or like how are you
48:03 - doing no they were not I I like it was
48:06 - it was too much and and the it was the
48:09 - kind of thing where I really loved the
48:11 - product and working on it I just
48:13 - physically couldn't handle it anymore um
48:15 - and so I ended up I ended up leaving
48:18 - because I I was just burning out but I'm
48:20 - to this day I'm still an adviser for
48:21 - them where like I still talk with them
48:23 - regularly and stuff and have a great
48:24 - relationship with them because I do like
48:26 - the product and what they're doing I
48:27 - just was so tired yeah they're they're a
48:30 - cool company and you know I as I always
48:33 - like to tell the tale of me being in
48:35 - hackathons with Matt bman the founder uh
48:39 - and they've been a supporter of Freo
48:40 - Camp early on uh as well and we we have
48:43 - used their tools over the years um so
48:46 - many things to talk about so many things
48:48 - and I I still have two more jobs to go
48:50 - okay go ahead let's continue yeah and so
48:53 - after that I I considered starting my
48:55 - own thing and like took a little break
48:57 - cuz I was like maybe I will maybe I will
48:59 - then I didn't and I ended up going to
49:01 - remote remote.com to uh I was ahead of
49:04 - developer education there and I was
49:06 - going to see like okay what what
49:08 - resources can I provide for remote
49:10 - developers remote grew so fast where
49:14 - when I first started talking with them
49:16 - in like early pandemic days just like
49:17 - friendly they were at like 25 people
49:20 - then when I interviewed it was more like
49:22 - 200 people wow which was quite a big
49:24 - jump but
49:26 - I joined they were at a thousand people
49:29 - they exploded in growth you can't gr
49:32 - that quickly without making a lot of bad
49:34 - hires in my opinion like I just don't I
49:36 - don't believe for a second that an
49:38 - organization can grow that quickly
49:39 - without cracks forming I it was yeah and
49:42 - unfortunately I think I kind of was
49:43 - falling through some of those cracks
49:44 - where like everybody was so kind and and
49:48 - there's such lovely people there which
49:49 - once again still stay in touch with them
49:51 - um but it just grew so fast and and
49:56 - I would be working on something like I I
49:58 - ran like the devs for Ukraine conference
50:00 - to uh help support developers there and
50:02 - people there to raise money and I I was
50:04 - able to do some cool initiatives but so
50:07 - many things I was just like hey this is
50:09 - like the plan for this and people would
50:11 - say Cassidy that's awesome we don't have
50:13 - time for that because it was growing so
50:15 - much um and so anyway I really liked it
50:19 - there but it just it was so much um and
50:23 - then this is where like the personal
50:24 - things came into play I got pregnant and
50:28 - I was just like is this the kind of role
50:30 - that I want to continue doing while I'm
50:33 - pregnant and will I have the flexibility
50:35 - to like be able to take care of my kid
50:37 - and stuff and um that's when I started
50:40 - talking more with contendo where I've
50:42 - been I had been an adviser for them for
50:45 - a year a year and a half for them at
50:47 - that point and um they had been talking
50:50 - to me about how they wanted to find a
50:51 - CTO to fill in some gaps and so as I was
50:55 - talking with them I was like so what if
50:57 - I was that CTO and and uh we kind of
51:00 - talked as a whole team and it just kind
51:02 - of was a very natural fit where I knew
51:04 - everybody really well I had met with
51:06 - them in person a bunch of times and and
51:09 - we we were like friends in addition to
51:11 - colleagues and stuff and yeah it just
51:14 - seemed like the right fit and I've been
51:16 - with them ever since awesome so many
51:18 - different stops your journey uh
51:21 - and uh I'm going to link to your
51:24 - LinkedIn in case anybody wants to to
51:26 - follow you there or like read through I
51:28 - was in I was like you know she's she's
51:31 - younger than I am uh I don't know I'm
51:32 - not going to ask your age but you're
51:34 - like way younger than me and yet youve
51:35 - worked at like 10 times as many places
51:38 - as I am I think it's it's wild like I
51:40 - think there were like 20 plus entries on
51:42 - your like experience so many of it is
51:45 - like advisory roles and like parttime
51:46 - things too but yeah I and it like when I
51:50 - go into the story like that companies
51:52 - never question why I have such a big
51:54 - resume they're just like oh well of of
51:55 - course oh yeah that makes sense like
51:56 - it's it's never me just saying I wanted
51:58 - more money so I left it's it's usually
52:01 - you have good reasons for every single
52:02 - thing and one of the two of the reasons
52:04 - that I do want to drill deeper into one
52:08 - is you know the notion of culture which
52:10 - a lot of people uh who are privileged
52:13 - just like culture doesn't even exist
52:15 - what is that it's like nonsense you know
52:16 - Corp culture always exists yeah what are
52:20 - what you would call cultural indicators
52:22 - uh and and maybe we can back up and we
52:24 - can talk about if you don't mind me just
52:27 - saying your experience in Tech as a
52:30 - woman because women uh I don't like it
52:34 - but women are a minority in Tech I think
52:38 - they depending on like maybe maybe you
52:41 - have like a good estimate of the number
52:43 - of women in Tech or the proportion of
52:45 - women in last stat I saw was 133% 133%
52:49 - yeah and there was like a stack Overflow
52:50 - survey a few years ago where like 6% of
52:53 - the respondents were women or something
52:55 - like that that it was like really low um
52:57 - and of course like I can tell you like
52:59 - fre Co Camp we're very proud that about
53:00 - a third of the people learning on free
53:03 - Camp are women that's not 50% but right
53:06 - but still that's good proportionally
53:08 - compared to a lot of the industry and
53:10 - it's going to be a multigenerational
53:12 - effort to get more women into Tech uh in
53:14 - my humble opinion uh there are lots of
53:17 - cultural things and a lot of economic
53:18 - reasons and a lot of just like systemic
53:22 - you know bias reasons uh but maybe you
53:24 - could talk a little bit about your own
53:26 - kind of like entree into Tech and the
53:28 - first time that you felt like wow I I
53:31 - didn't realize there were so few women
53:32 - in Tech yeah I found out early on that
53:37 - there were not many women in Tech
53:39 - because I took AP Computer Science in
53:40 - high school where I first started coding
53:43 - before that where I was just like oh
53:45 - wait you can make websites and I was
53:47 - really excited to play around with with
53:50 - HTML CSS JavaScript and just kind of was
53:52 - figuring things out and was having a
53:54 - blast doing it and then when I realized
53:56 - that my school was offering AP Computer
53:58 - Science I was like oh I'm going to take
54:00 - that and and it'll be great and
54:02 - literally the first thing that the
54:04 - teacher said in the class on the first
54:06 - day was as you can see we have a girl
54:08 - this year I was like oh and uh yeah that
54:13 - that that was a very rude awakening
54:15 - where it just the that was the theme for
54:18 - a lot of girl this year that's wild yeah
54:23 - that that was my first like group inter
54:25 - action um but that is how I found NC wit
54:30 - which I mentioned earlier where where
54:31 - like and what what is National Center
54:34 - for Women in it I'm going to link to
54:35 - that yeah they're awesome they they have
54:38 - uh awards for high school girls every
54:40 - year and then they also have a
54:42 - Collegiate organization they they're
54:45 - they're a research organization so they
54:46 - put together really good uh research um
54:50 - and informationals that companies can
54:52 - use and stuff they're they're a really
54:53 - great orc but any anyway I first got
54:57 - involved with them because in that class
54:59 - when I would like finish an exercise and
55:01 - had time I would just start like looking
55:03 - up like how do how do I find other girls
55:07 - because I just didn't know where they
55:09 - were um and yeah so that that's how I
55:12 - first got involved with NY wit um
55:14 - because I was looking for a community
55:16 - where I didn't have one yet so you were
55:19 - not content to just accept that like
55:21 - okay everybody I interact with is going
55:23 - to be a dude you very early tried to
55:26 - like build connections with other women
55:28 - at Tech yeah and like I'm okay with I'm
55:32 - okay with hanging out dudes and I kind
55:34 - of have to be because because of the
55:36 - nature of tech and and so many of my
55:39 - college courses there would be like one
55:41 - or two of us or or something just funny
55:44 - story recently I was I was just walking
55:45 - around in Chicago and I saw one of the
55:47 - girls where she was like the other one
55:49 - in my course and we looked at each other
55:51 - like you live in Chicago hi and like we
55:54 - just hadn't seen each each other since
55:56 - college and it was cool to be just where
55:58 - like we were introducing our husbands
56:00 - and we were just like she was the other
56:02 - one we this is great um the bond it's
56:06 - it's forever but uh
56:09 - anyway it it was something where like I
56:12 - knew there had to be something out there
56:14 - and then luckily there was and it's
56:16 - something where in general I think you
56:18 - should have a community no matter the
56:21 - industry to stay in it where people have
56:24 - your back um where like whe whether
56:27 - whether it's a diverse one or not it
56:29 - should be a diverse one but you know
56:30 - like it it's having a community that can
56:34 - check on you and be just like hey how
56:35 - did this thing go I know you were
56:36 - worried about it or hey good luck on
56:39 - your job interview this day or or let's
56:42 - talk through this problem you're having
56:43 - or something Have having that kind of
56:45 - community is so so valuable and I think
56:48 - is particularly pretty hard again in
56:50 - this post-pandemic world but again
56:52 - that's why I have like my patreon
56:54 - Discord group we have we are such a
56:57 - great Community where it's just us
56:58 - talking about this is this is what I'm
57:00 - trying to learn right now and uh there's
57:02 - there's so many good ones associated
57:04 - with free code camp and on Twitter and
57:06 - and various places have having those
57:08 - communities is so important and that's
57:11 - that's been something that has been so
57:13 - helpful to me throughout my career yeah
57:16 - and so you've talked a little bit in the
57:18 - past about like kind of cultural
57:20 - indicators that you look for to
57:21 - companies you even tweeted a few days
57:23 - ago I think I was scrolling through your
57:25 - Twitter earlier that you think that
57:27 - companies should offer three different
57:29 - things and if they don't offer at least
57:31 - two of those three things you shouldn't
57:32 - consider them as like a serious
57:35 - opportunity uh maybe do you recall what
57:38 - those three things were yeah and so that
57:40 - that's while you're at the company or
57:42 - while you're interviewing they should
57:43 - have good pay good culture and good
57:45 - growth opportunities yeah two out of
57:48 - three is pretty good all three would be
57:50 - great um but if if you're at a company
57:53 - and you realize oh I only have one out
57:55 - of three or something or or I don't have
57:57 - any of these or or something you might
57:59 - want to question why you're there that
58:01 - doesn't necessarily mean jump ship
58:03 - because having a job is good but yeah if
58:07 - you if you don't question those kinds of
58:09 - things then you will be stuck in a
58:11 - situation that's not serving you well
58:14 - yeah well I would argue that like just
58:16 - from looking at the job application you
58:18 - can probably figure out the compensation
58:20 - if they publicly list that and you you
58:22 - might even be able to surmise like
58:24 - software engineer 2 probably leads to
58:26 - software engineer 3 probably leads to
58:28 - like Engineering Management you know
58:30 - role uh so like assuming it's like a big
58:34 - tech company and that people do
58:35 - gradually rise up the ranks
58:39 - um that is that's basically two of them
58:41 - that you can kind of surmise just from
58:43 - doing a little bit of research but
58:45 - culture is a little bit trickier and how
58:48 - would you establish whether a company
58:50 - has a you know a healthy culture that's
58:53 - like conducive to being able to work and
58:55 - be sane and stuff like that how would
58:57 - you figure that out if you were on the
58:59 - outside and you were looking at a
59:00 - company and considering applying what
59:02 - what are the uh kind of the telltale
59:04 - signs of like potentially toxic culture
59:08 - yeah well so first of all one that I've
59:11 - seen and where I've actually like gone
59:13 - in the other direction is where they say
59:14 - oh we don't really have a culture
59:16 - yet all companies have a culture like if
59:20 - you say that there is no culture that
59:22 - means that there might not be a great
59:23 - culture like like all companies have
59:25 - have some element of culture there um
59:27 - but then I also I'm very curious to sus
59:30 - out how people communicate across an orc
59:33 - um and so I typically one question that
59:35 - I actually ask in job interviews is
59:38 - what's the most important thing the
59:40 - customer the product or the employees
59:42 - and none of those answers are wrong like
59:45 - those are all actually like they're
59:46 - they're all three important but if you
59:48 - were to pick one what what is the most
59:49 - important customer product or employees
59:52 - um and what's interesting about the
59:54 - answers is how people answer them and if
59:57 - that answer is consistent across
59:58 - interviewers where like when I
60:01 - interviewed at Amazon every single
60:03 - person said the customer like it was a
60:05 - very very clear customer Obsession right
60:07 - I customer Obsession that's what they're
60:08 - all about yeah and and so you know that
60:12 - they communicate well on that front and
60:14 - granted the culture wasn't that great
60:15 - when I was at Amazon but it it it was a
60:18 - good indicator of how people
60:19 - communicated and when people answer that
60:22 - question differently then it's
60:24 - interesting to see okay why do you why
60:26 - do they answer it differently how did
60:27 - their answers differ um when they
60:29 - explain it because sometimes the the way
60:31 - they explain it you're just like oh it
60:33 - makes sense why this person would answer
60:34 - this way and this person would answer
60:35 - this way but um again none of those
60:38 - answers are wrong but it's useful to see
60:40 - we're like when I internet into it I
60:42 - I've been doing this for a lot many
60:43 - years now internet into it everybody
60:45 - said oh the employees are number one and
60:48 - and here's why I think it and and it's
60:51 - it's cool to see how people communicate
60:54 - about what their environment is and then
60:57 - one last one that uh that I like to ask
60:59 - is just if you had a magic wand and
61:01 - could change anything about the company
61:03 - what would you change um and seeing
61:05 - people do that where like like it's not
61:08 - necessarily a bad thing but what what is
61:09 - the magic wand that that thing that you
61:11 - would change people's answers there are
61:15 - very good ways to sus out how things are
61:18 - where sometimes people are just like I
61:20 - would get rid of this group in the
61:23 - company where where it's just like I I
61:24 - don't want we have too many product
61:27 - managers or something um sometimes the
61:30 - answer has been I don't like that we're
61:32 - under the fist of capitalism I would
61:33 - probably wish away our VCS or something
61:36 - like that and and you can kind of see
61:38 - what is the thing that drives uh culture
61:42 - or NE anything negative or or something
61:44 - at the company and so anyway those are
61:46 - the questions I answer and it's been
61:47 - pretty helpful for those are great
61:49 - questions um especially like what would
61:51 - you wish away man
61:55 - like when you as that I was like what
61:56 - would I
61:58 - well we're not interviewing me here but
62:01 - one thing I would wish away is the
62:02 - complexity of the US immigration system
62:06 - I would I would love to be able to say
62:07 - to everybody who works at freeo Camp
62:09 - we're going to get you and H1B visa and
62:11 - if you want you can come and live here
62:12 - in the US um so that unfortunately
62:15 - that's yeah I mean you you probably I
62:18 - don't know how much of the immigration
62:20 - system you've had to go through with
62:21 - your husband but it was it's been it's
62:24 - been
62:25 - yeah yeah it's quite complicated to uh
62:28 - to get even like so we have a team
62:31 - member here in the US and sorry I'm not
62:34 - going to like bash the us but I will
62:36 - bash the US immigration system that is
62:37 - one thing that I've I think that's fair
62:39 - it's within my right as a US taxpayer as
62:42 - somebody who works to you know make this
62:44 - country better that I can complain about
62:47 - the immigration system so uh we have a
62:50 - team member who is working she's also
62:52 - working at Salesforce uh she's working
62:53 - parttime at free Co Camp developing some
62:55 - courses and she you know studied in the
62:58 - US she's worked as a software engineer
63:01 - at Salesforce for like four years um
63:05 - actually it may not be four years but
63:06 - she's the four years that she's been
63:08 - here in the US she's applied to the H1B
63:13 - Lottery and she every single time she
63:15 - has not gotten it and this is absolutely
63:17 - the kind of like well-educated like
63:20 - highly compensated like expert that the
63:23 - US
63:26 - yeah and she's going to have to move to
63:27 - Canada if she doesn't win this time like
63:29 - there's like a limit in the number of
63:30 - times and Salesforce actually has like
63:32 - an entire like plan in place for uh
63:35 - employees who can't get an H1B Visa
63:37 - through the lottery uh despite spending
63:39 - you know tens of thousands of dollars
63:41 - and everything to try to get help them
63:42 - get that they have to move up to
63:44 - Vancouver from the San Francisco Bay
63:46 - area and they have to continue working
63:48 - from the Vancouver you know satellite so
63:50 - it's just one of those things it's like
63:51 - why does America shoot itself in the
63:53 - foot with this terrible immigration
63:55 - system but anyway I'm sorry I'll stop
63:57 - venting but but that is my magic that
63:59 - would be a great magic wand I would like
64:01 - to borrow that one that's one of the few
64:03 - things that like me as like a founder
64:05 - and like executive director which is
64:07 - basically the charity equivalent of a of
64:10 - a CEO like that's one thing that I feel
64:12 - completely powerless over uh I can
64:14 - change so much and like like we we work
64:17 - very hard to attract lots of women to
64:19 - work at free C Camp and and as I may
64:21 - have said earlier we're like nearly half
64:23 - women on our team both engineering and
64:26 - instructional and you know we're proud
64:29 - of that and yeah it takes a concertive
64:33 - effort to not only uh encourage women to
64:37 - join your team but to retain them over
64:40 - time because yeah uh it sounds like some
64:43 - of your cultural experiences I mean like
64:47 - when you look at culture like how much
64:49 - of it has come down to like they they do
64:51 - they have systematic bias against women
64:54 - at some of these organizations you
64:56 - worked at I don't want you to have to
64:57 - like Lobby
64:58 - specific lob specific accusations or
65:00 - anything but I left Amazon for a reason
65:05 - like and and luckily like with with some
65:08 - of the organizations sorry there's a big
65:10 - siren coming out outside so no worries
65:13 - we're in Chicago after all and it's a
65:15 - big city like a do you live in the BBS
65:17 - or I live in Chicago proper yeah oh wow
65:20 - yeah it's and it's great I just happen
65:22 - to live somewhat near a fire St so
65:25 - that's why we have some Sirens but
65:27 - anyway um luckily I think in a lot of my
65:31 - jobs it hasn't been too bad relatively
65:34 - speaking like like
65:36 - I I have no room to complain because
65:40 - people close to me have gone through so
65:42 - much worse that being said it exists
65:45 - there there's there's definitely
65:47 - systemic biases and very unkind people
65:52 - in the world who who let those biases
65:53 - the affect their decisions and and the
65:55 - words they say and the things that they
65:56 - do um and yeah when when I I'll just a a
66:02 - brief vignette when I was at Amazon like
66:05 - there was a point where I was for
66:07 - example supposed to run an event for a
66:09 - bunch of uh customers who were building
66:11 - on top of the echo devices I'm not
66:13 - saying her name because she's back there
66:14 - and she'll talk back okay um but anyway
66:17 - I was I was running inent it was a big
66:19 - deal like I was literally reporting
66:21 - certain findings to the s team which is
66:23 - the people who reports Jeff Bezos like
66:25 - it it was a big event and people weren't
66:27 - responding to my emails and I was like
66:29 - you need to submit your talks to me so I
66:30 - can put together this and and like make
66:33 - sure that these technical areas are
66:35 - covered and stuff people just wouldn't
66:37 - respond to me and I remember talking to
66:40 - my manager saying like hey do I need to
66:42 - build some clout here or something to so
66:44 - that way people respond he said oh it's
66:46 - cuz you're a woman we have a problem
66:47 - with that here like cool great well at
66:50 - least he acknowledge that it's a known
66:52 - issue but yeah do something about it
66:54 - what the heck so and like he he replied
66:56 - all to my group email to all of these
66:58 - people saying Hey give Cassidy the info
67:01 - they would say okay hey Dave here's the
67:02 - stuff like within an hour after me him
67:05 - they wouldn't add addressing him not me
67:07 - and like there were that that's like a
67:10 - very brief small minor thing but there
67:13 - was so much more that happened beyond
67:15 - that that like it it just it was
67:17 - miserable and and unfortunately like
67:21 - that was nothing compared to what some
67:22 - of the women on my team were going
67:24 - through there or my own sister was going
67:26 - through there yeah let's talk about your
67:27 - sister a little bit too she's somebody
67:29 - we I mean you've mentioned her a couple
67:31 - times but she followed very closely in
67:33 - your footsteps it sounds like or as you
67:35 - said before we met she followed in her
67:36 - own footsteps tell us a little bit about
67:38 - your sister footsteps yeah yeah and so
67:41 - my sister and I were were pretty close
67:43 - in age and we both majored in computer
67:44 - science that Iowa State um and uh we've
67:48 - worked together multiple times and then
67:51 - all and really diverged because we both
67:53 - like very different environments where
67:56 - um she and I both worked at clarify the
67:58 - startup and then we also both worked at
67:59 - Amazon together and uh I love startups
68:03 - she loves big companies so she she's
68:06 - kind of collected like The Infinity
68:08 - Gauntlet of big companies where she's
68:09 - worked at Apple Microsoft Google Amazon
68:12 - and now meta got to catch them all wow
68:14 - that's that's impressive like the entire
68:17 - Fang basically she's literally all the
68:19 - like she doesn't have Netflix but once
68:20 - she does she's done she she's made it
68:23 - but but yeah so she she must get a lot
68:26 - of recruiters reaching out to her my
68:28 - goodness I can only imagine and I hope I
68:30 - would like to think that her recruit
68:32 - like in recruiting like one of the big
68:35 - things the signal is where they already
68:36 - work because if they're good enough to
68:37 - work there there's a good chance they're
68:39 - good enough to work here like I can
68:41 - imagine she has a very easy time getting
68:43 - jobs if she does have a hard time
68:45 - getting jobs she's also just really good
68:47 - at what she does yeah and so and and
68:49 - it's fun cuz she and I work together
68:51 - really well like it's it's really fun to
68:53 - do things with her like when we were
68:55 - both at clarify we would sometimes give
68:57 - talks together um which was a blast
68:59 - because that people would approach us
69:01 - being like how long did you rehearse
69:02 - that your back and forth was amazing and
69:04 - we were just like we didn't we're
69:06 - related we've been practicing this for
69:09 - decades um and uh yeah and when we both
69:12 - worked at Amazon we did like a live
69:14 - stream for the echo showing people how
69:16 - to how to work with like buttons and
69:17 - stuff together and that was so fun too
69:19 - so we we really enjoy working together
69:21 - but we like very different work
69:22 - environments yeah where uh like my my
69:26 - mom says like I'm like the wild west
69:28 - cowboy and she's the one who's like an
69:30 - English writer where she prefers like a
69:32 - lot of structure big organization all
69:35 - that and I kind of just don't want
69:37 - anybody to bother me as I do what I want
69:39 - to to start that's so interesting that
69:41 - you all have very similar like I would
69:43 - imagine probably pretty similar
69:44 - upbringing both growing up in Chicago
69:46 - both studying at the same school both
69:48 - studying in the same field working at
69:50 - some of the same companies and yet it
69:52 - sounds like personality wise and
69:54 - certainly in terms of preferences for
69:55 - career You're So Different yeah yeah
69:59 - exactly and like there's a lot of
70:01 - similarities don't get me wrong like we
70:02 - both married software engineers and and
70:05 - uh do have a lot of similar hobbies and
70:07 - stuff but yeah she she and I are very
70:10 - different in what we like in terms of
70:14 - what makes us productive and everything
70:16 - and and we both are very interested in
70:20 - Dev advocacy and teaching and helping
70:21 - developers but she approaches from a I
70:24 - have a big company with all of these
70:26 - resources if I can like play the system
70:28 - well enough I can offer this many
70:30 - resources to people and with me I like
70:33 - the scrappy approach where it's just
70:34 - like what can I do to provide these
70:36 - resources to people and and the we we
70:39 - both have varying levels of success with
70:41 - different approaches stuff but it it
70:43 - works well for both of us yeah it sounds
70:45 - like it um I mean you both obviously
70:48 - have these story careers and it's so
70:50 - interesting to see like how you've
70:53 - diverg
70:54 - one thing that I would like to talk
70:56 - about because you talked about
70:57 - productivity and you also alluded
70:59 - earlier to burnout is you are somebody
71:02 - who is like you have a literal baby like
71:06 - I think he said is like nine months old
71:08 - yeah and you also are a CTO and you're
71:12 - also creating all this content pretty
71:14 - reliably uh on like all these different
71:17 - platforms
71:18 - like how do you avoid burnout when
71:21 - you're doing all those things and have
71:23 - you ever gotten close to burnout and
71:25 - since you were getting close and like
71:27 - been able to pull back before you go
71:29 - over the burnout Cliff so to speak and
71:31 - have to like climb your way all the way
71:33 - up the mountain again yeah I've really
71:36 - had to learn how to say no um I think my
71:39 - my two biggest burnout times where um
71:42 - one point at venmo I I was saying yes to
71:45 - everything because I was like if I do a
71:47 - lot of work now while I like am young
71:49 - and have energy it'll be good for me
71:51 - later in very yes but it was terrible
71:53 - for me healthwise where like there was a
71:55 - period where I spoke at an event for 14
71:58 - days straight like including the
71:59 - weekends in addition to the 9 to-5 job I
72:02 - I just I was doing way too much and I
72:04 - just burnt out so hard after that I like
72:07 - ran off to Florida to hang out with my
72:08 - grandpa after that that's wild 14 man
72:13 - how did you like get from event to event
72:15 - was it just like was it all in like the
72:16 - Bay Area or some kind of Cal it was
72:18 - mostly in New York City and then yeah
72:20 - there was there's I think there's a
72:21 - little bit of travel like by train at
72:23 - point I don't even remember all of them
72:25 - because it was a bad choice um anyway so
72:30 - that that was a big one and then um I'm
72:32 - not counting College I kind of burnt out
72:34 - at one point in college it was fine I
72:36 - almost went blind but then I went moved
72:37 - to Spain and I was fine um and then uh
72:40 - the next one was at NFI I was really
72:42 - close to burning out and again that's
72:44 - why I ended up leaving where I still
72:46 - loved that team and everything but I was
72:48 - just I I had to for my health I had to I
72:51 - had to go um and and I think yeah now I
72:55 - see the signs more where I'm just like
72:56 - oo I need to cut back on this or that
72:58 - and and I think a lot of burnout it
73:00 - doesn't come from doing a lot because
73:02 - kind of like you said I I tend to do a
73:04 - lot but it's more doing a lot that isn't
73:07 - aligned with your values yeah and that
73:09 - isn't aligned with what's important to
73:11 - you we like my Weekly Newsletter it's a
73:14 - lot of work because it's weekly and
73:16 - there's there's a lot to do with it and
73:17 - stuff and I manage sponsors and and all
73:20 - of the interview practice question
73:22 - responses and and various content things
73:25 - like that but it's something that's
73:27 - important to me it's something that I
73:28 - ultimately like doing and my like goal
73:31 - of helping developers it works towards
73:34 - that goal and so it it doesn't cause me
73:36 - to burn out um and if I were to do
73:40 - something that is
73:42 - not aligned with what matters to me
73:46 - where it's it's truly just like I know I
73:47 - can do this but it's it's a ton of work
73:50 - I think that's that's what would cause
73:52 - me to burn out more interesting so doing
73:54 - things that are not aligned with your
73:55 - values that don't feel like they're
73:57 - advancing what you care about advancing
74:00 - that seems to be uh a theme but like are
74:02 - there any signs you said that you kind
74:03 - of saw the signs yeah uh of burnout and
74:07 - like what are the signs people should be
74:08 - looking for not caring
74:11 - anymore I feel like I feel like that's
74:13 - probably the biggest the biggest sign
74:16 - red flag thing that you could see where
74:18 - where if you start to be like resigned
74:20 - to this is this is just how it is I just
74:23 - don't care anymore I'm just kind of
74:24 - going through the emotions that's the
74:25 - biggest one for me cuz though I don't
74:28 - think like work should be everything to
74:30 - you I don't think that it should be like
74:32 - the thing that you only care about it
74:35 - it's something that you it's something
74:36 - that you do for so much of your life you
74:38 - should care about it a little bit and uh
74:42 - if you simply just don't care anymore
74:44 - it's it's kind of like the the opposite
74:46 - of Love isn't hate it's indifference
74:48 - it's it's that kind of stuff where where
74:51 - if you if you truly are just
74:54 - I I can tell when I'm starting to get to
74:56 - a burnout point where like if I'm in a
74:58 - meeting or something I'm just like none
74:59 - of this matters I don't know why like
75:02 - like you you kind of just like start to
75:04 - feel that and and I feel like that's for
75:06 - me that's the biggest number one sign
75:08 - more than any like tiredness or or
75:12 - stress things yeah I'm just trying to
75:15 - think of like if you find yourself in
75:17 - that situation where you feel you're
75:19 - just getting more distant from the task
75:21 - at hand you're carrying less about the
75:23 - outcome of different things uh good news
75:27 - resonates less positively with you it
75:29 - doesn't really lay bad news you feel
75:32 - numb what um what can you do to like
75:35 - shake that up like obviously burnout you
75:38 - you finished College despite getting
75:40 - almost going blind you said yeah is
75:44 - there is that a long story or is just
75:45 - like long story short I took way too
75:48 - many courses because I knew I was going
75:52 - to be moving to Spain and I wasn't
75:55 - sleeping I was sleeping on average like
75:57 - between 1 and 3 hours a night at the
75:59 - most and yeah almost went blind don't do
76:02 - that kids like you went to the doctor
76:04 - and they said if you keep doing this
76:05 - you're going to lose your vision like
76:06 - what like how do it wasn't so much if
76:08 - you keep doing this it was one day I
76:10 - couldn't open my eyes and they were like
76:14 - I I remember I went to vacation with my
76:17 - family and I had to wear an eye patch
76:18 - the whole time because like I literally
76:20 - couldn't open one of my eyes anymore and
76:22 - like we were at like a literally like a
76:24 - doctor in a poblo and he was just like
76:27 - something's wrong with your eye like the
76:28 - whites of my eyes were gray and and like
76:31 - they were just my eyes were
76:32 - disintegrating anyway you should sleep
76:36 - that's the that's the conclusion there
76:38 - okay yeah sleep PSA Public Service
76:41 - Announcement please sleep everybody
76:43 - sleep eight hours if you can yeah but
76:46 - but to answer your question though about
76:48 - like what you can do um first of all
76:52 - lean on your community I've said that
76:53 - before I feel like the the first answer
76:56 - that a lot of people might shout is
76:58 - self-care but if you shout self-care at
77:01 - someone who could use a community um
77:03 - that that's that's doing a disservice to
77:06 - that person it's it's really important
77:07 - to have people around you who can kind
77:09 - of talk to you and and like kind of kind
77:12 - of give you a reality check and and and
77:15 - be there for you but then also on the
77:17 - self-care front do things that you like
77:20 - and and just say no to certain things
77:22 - and be just like I need to step back
77:24 - from this or something and build a Lego
77:27 - set go travel and run off to Florida to
77:30 - see your grandpa like do do do something
77:33 - that that is very unrelated to work
77:35 - sometimes for me it's truly just like
77:37 - I'm going to just watch a K drama on
77:38 - Netflix I I I'm gonna do K my mom loves
77:42 - those they're so good but but yeah like
77:45 - like do do something that is like just
77:48 - for you to remind yourself I am a person
77:51 - Beyond this thing that I am not like
77:53 - doing and and sometimes like when I
77:56 - start approaching that moment I just do
77:58 - one of those things and I'm okay like a
78:00 - week later um and if it's something
78:03 - that's more prolonged and heavy that
78:05 - it's much harder to to fight against
78:07 - that but it's now acknowledged in
78:11 - multiple countries now that burnout is a
78:13 - real mental condition that that you need
78:15 - to fight against and you need to try to
78:18 - be proactive in leaning on the people
78:21 - that you care about be around people who
78:22 - care about you and do things that you
78:24 - care about yeah yeah I mean I I like to
78:27 - say that like you can accomplish so much
78:29 - in your life life is so long it's almost
78:32 - ridiculous how long life is and I say
78:33 - this as like a 43y old man who like
78:36 - can't believe that like if everything
78:38 - goes well I've got like a whole another
78:40 - 40 50 years to look forward to uh
78:43 - because it feels like life has been
78:45 - forever especially during the pandemic
78:46 - when time slowed down you can accomplish
78:49 - so much if you just don't burn out and
78:51 - just put forth like a consistent effort
78:53 - over time that's one of the things that
78:55 - really inspires me about you is you have
78:58 - kept going in terms of your newsletter
79:01 - for example you have kept going in terms
79:03 - of streaming in terms of creating these
79:05 - videos like you you you're not the kind
79:07 - of person who seems to get bored of
79:09 - something and just completely starts
79:11 - from fresh and like jumps from one fan
79:13 - flight of fantasy to the next like
79:15 - you're you're incredibly consistent over
79:17 - time and that's how I know that like I'm
79:21 - going to be excited to watch a cuz good
79:23 - things are are coming to you I want to
79:26 - talk about advice for people out there
79:28 - who may not feel that good things are
79:30 - coming to them and may not know how to
79:33 - get in the Rhythm like people that just
79:34 - got a CS degree and are having trouble
79:37 - uh applying for jobs people that are
79:38 - transitioning into Tech having
79:40 - difficulty applying for jobs there's
79:42 - like this kind of miasma in the air like
79:45 - oh Tech is dead like Developer jobs
79:48 - don't go there go go back to like
79:50 - culinary school or what real estate
79:52 - whatever kind of crap advice people are
79:54 - getting in my humble op like I don't
79:55 - want to B like don't go to culinary
79:57 - school I heard from so many chefs that
79:58 - like nobody goes to culinary school but
80:01 - like but yeah like like how do you
80:04 - counter that and how do you reassure
80:05 - people that no this The Sun Will Come
80:08 - Out Tomorrow you know it's just a rainy
80:10 - day yeah and that's that's the thing I
80:13 - feel like a lot of new devs or people
80:15 - who haven't been through a few spells of
80:18 - the oh no Tech is dying the they're
80:21 - they're just like oh my gosh Tech really
80:22 - is dying I'm kind of just like it's died
80:24 - before it's but it keeps coming back
80:27 - there like we are in an increasingly
80:30 - digital world and Tech is going nowhere
80:33 - like sure we're going there's like waves
80:35 - of layoffs and stuff happening economies
80:37 - come and go but it's going to come back
80:41 - and you might as well be prepared for
80:42 - when it does and and I already like
80:44 - knock on wood who knows what's going on
80:46 - but uh it feels like it's already coming
80:49 - back uh like jobs wise and stuff I was
80:52 - talking to a friend yesterday where she
80:54 - was saying I don't know if I should quit
80:55 - my job she saw my tweet about like the
80:58 - three things that you should have in a
80:59 - role and she's like I have barely one of
81:01 - these I but like I'm afraid to apply and
81:05 - I said I think things are coming back
81:07 - and she messaged me like two hours later
81:09 - saying oh my gosh there's so many jobs
81:11 - what nobody's talking about how many
81:12 - people are hiring right now everybody's
81:14 - just talking about the layoffs don't
81:15 - listen to the the loud people shouting
81:19 - that the sky is falling like keep an eye
81:21 - out for good opportunities because there
81:23 - are so many uh you just have to know
81:25 - where to look and you also don't have to
81:28 - work at a very traditional tech company
81:30 - you don't have to work for like the
81:32 - microsofts and the apples you could work
81:34 - for a company like General Mills which
81:36 - is where one of my internships were food
81:38 - compan company lots of tasty breakfast
81:41 - cereal oh my gosh I had so many snacks
81:43 - there it was an amazing place to work I
81:45 - loved General Mills um but anyway like
81:48 - if I move to Minneapolis Sunday it's
81:49 - because I want to work there um there
81:52 - there's there's so many companies out
81:54 - there that can offer you good pay work
81:57 - life balance that aren't tech companies
82:00 - um they a good culture good good
82:02 - learning opportunities and and you just
82:04 - have to be willing to look where where
82:06 - one friend of mine uh was so burnt out
82:09 - by the tech industry he was just like I
82:11 - I feel like I need to quit software
82:12 - engineering but I like software
82:14 - engineering but I'm just tired of this
82:15 - environment and and he decided to just
82:18 - look into health and be like well where
82:20 - how can I help like doctors and stuff
82:22 - without actually having to become one
82:24 - and now he works for a health tech
82:25 - company where it's very separate from
82:28 - the shouting on Twitter and and like the
82:30 - the what is the next thing after react
82:33 - type conversations and he loves it where
82:35 - he's able to do these skills that he has
82:37 - but he's working at a company that's not
82:40 - Tech related he's just using his Tech
82:41 - skills and and the stat that I've always
82:44 - heard is like two-thirds of Developer
82:46 - jobs are outside of what we
82:47 - traditionally consider Tech General
82:50 - Mills is not a tech company
82:53 - you know I would not argue that the car
82:55 - companies are tech companies or that
82:57 - Finance is Tech you know uh we we had a
83:01 - long conversation about this the other
83:02 - day uh I genuinely believe that uh if
83:07 - you're just looking at the big companies
83:09 - that are just doing these kind of
83:10 - layoffs like um a lot of which is like
83:13 - you know fast follower kind of like hey
83:15 - it's okay to lay people off CU you know
83:17 - this company just did so we're going to
83:19 - do it too right um and and a lot of
83:21 - employers will use like the the economy
83:23 - as an excuse for um just basically
83:26 - trying to have additional bargaining
83:28 - power over job candidates and things
83:30 - like that uh I love what you say don't
83:33 - listen to the loud people shouting that
83:35 - the sky is falling like don't listen to
83:38 - them the future is bright and one of the
83:40 - things that people shout a whole lot is
83:42 - AI is GNA take our gerbs right I mean
83:46 - what are your
83:47 - thoughts yeah it is but um like it's
83:50 - gonna improve but yeah
83:53 - I mean like that is probably the most
83:55 - common question I get uh every week I
83:58 - get dozens of emails I'm not
84:00 - exaggerating because I I send like 7
84:02 - million emails my email list is really
84:03 - big and uh when people reply they're
84:06 - like hey is any of this even matter like
84:09 - aren't the AI just going to be able to
84:11 - do everything the developer can do and
84:13 - better like uh they have this kind of
84:15 - old John Henry kind of like driving
84:17 - spikes uh thing in their mind but that's
84:21 - not how software works
84:23 - and you know I I don't want to answer
84:25 - the question before I ask it but like
84:27 - what would you say to somebody who feels
84:29 - like they skills are going to be quickly
84:31 - outmoded by Ai and that in the future
84:34 - nobody's going to have a job and stuff
84:35 - like what would you say to them because
84:38 - I think my my pet theory is that it's
84:42 - very easy to procrastinate learning to
84:44 - code because it's such a big ambitious
84:46 - Endeavor and it's it's really good like
84:49 - copium if you will to to just say like
84:52 - well
84:52 - it doesn't matter if I learn to code
84:54 - anyway because the jobs aren't going to
84:55 - be there so therefore my decision to
84:57 - play video games yeah exactly like what
85:01 - do you think yeah Tech isn't good or
85:03 - Tech is going to keep going on and AI is
85:06 - probably not going to take your job AI
85:08 - is a really good tool and I feel like
85:10 - you can use it as such where like I'm
85:12 - sure when someone invented the crane
85:15 - there are a bunch of construction
85:16 - workers saying like oh no what are we
85:18 - going to do this big heavy thing is
85:20 - going to lift a big heavy thing and and
85:22 - I won't lift a big heavy thing now
85:25 - they're just using that tool to help
85:26 - lift the big heavy things kind of like
85:29 - when Alpha go came out uh I play Go
85:32 - daily I love playing go it's like that
85:34 - grid with the black and white pieces and
85:36 - back in like very accurate portrayal in
85:38 - that uh Knives Out movie yeah that was
85:42 - that was so fun I made a Kickstarter for
85:44 - go back in the day and used a clip from
85:45 - it but anyway um it's it's such a fun
85:48 - game this Alpha go bot like beat out so
85:52 - many different players but that doesn't
85:54 - mean that people stop playing go it's
85:57 - it's still such a fun and interesting
85:58 - game and now Alpha go is great at
86:00 - teaching you moves there are some moves
86:02 - that professionals were just like this
86:04 - is the correct move in this scenario for
86:06 - hundreds of years and then alphago
86:09 - changed that for the first time and
86:11 - people were just like wait we just never
86:13 - saw that you can use these tools to
86:16 - unlock different ways of thinking and
86:18 - different ways of being productive where
86:21 - I think like GitHub co-pilot is a really
86:23 - good example where it is a co-pilot it's
86:26 - a thing that can help you write things
86:28 - it's not always going to be right you
86:30 - are ultimately in the driver's seat
86:31 - building something but it can help you
86:34 - where like I don't need to write yet
86:35 - another sorting function or I don't need
86:37 - to write yet another hello world react
86:40 - component that I can just add stuff to I
86:42 - can I can do that and you can let it be
86:44 - a tool that you use to get your ideas
86:47 - across and be more productive on things
86:50 - it doesn't have to be this thing that's
86:52 - it's just going to take your job and I
86:55 - don't think it's going to take your job
86:56 - for a while cuz some of the codes where
86:59 - I've been just like oh AI wrote this for
87:01 - me amazing has been so bad or later I'm
87:04 - just like wait why did I listen to the
87:06 - AI llms large language models are very
87:10 - good at predicting what the next word
87:11 - should look like but that doesn't mean
87:13 - it's the right word and they are so bad
87:17 - at math and I use math as an example
87:19 - because math is a very precise thing if
87:21 - you
87:23 - have it do like a demo function for
87:25 - something a lot of the answers are going
87:28 - to be wrong because it's not actually
87:30 - executing code it's not actually doing
87:31 - the logic just does what it thinks the
87:33 - logic should look like and so anyway all
87:36 - that being said yes it's getting better
87:38 - and better but that just means that you
87:41 - can use it to solve more interesting
87:44 - problems 100% agreed use AI as a tool
87:48 - don't use it as an excuse not to learn
87:50 - ma math programming computer science you
87:53 - should still learn these skills and um I
87:56 - hope that you know people will follow
87:58 - you and watch many of your amazing
88:00 - videos maybe even join your patreon
88:02 - community because it sounds like
88:04 - Community is like a big deal in cat City
88:07 - Williams land and the fact that you've
88:09 - had that Community there you've you've
88:11 - helped Yourself by having that community
88:13 - and other people in your community are
88:15 - helping one another um Community
88:18 - self-care is no substitute for having
88:21 - other people who have your back and
88:23 - having that feeling that you're part of
88:24 - a tribe and you can help other people
88:26 - and they'll help you that General Vibe
88:29 - of reciprocation so I've learned so much
88:31 - from this conversation with you and I'm
88:33 - going to encourage everybody to check
88:34 - out the show notes below where I've
88:36 - included lots of links to interesting
88:38 - stuff about Cassidy uh and I I just want
88:41 - to thank you for your time because you
88:42 - know you're a busy mom CTO you're doing
88:46 - all these things and I feel very
88:48 - grateful that you've taken the time to
88:50 - come on the free code Camp podcast
88:52 - thank you so much for having me it was a
88:54 - really fun time well everybody until
88:57 - next week happy coding
89:00 - bye
