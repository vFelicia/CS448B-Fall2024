00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:08 - going to deploy our app
00:11 - so if this is the first time watching
00:13 - just a little recap we are on day eight
00:16 - of a project we're building a web app
00:20 - game it's just a very simple math game
00:23 - to help uh children who are new at math
00:27 - learn addition and subtraction
00:29 - multiplication and division
00:31 - so we build out
00:33 - basic functionality
00:36 - really really basic ui
00:39 - and i'd like to actually deploy this
00:42 - so that i can start testing it with my
00:44 - kids and you all could check it out and
00:48 - play it
00:50 - um
00:51 - or give advice on what which should be
00:53 - the next set of updates
00:55 - uh without having to actually actually
00:58 - pull down the code and run it locally
01:01 - so
01:03 - that's the plan for today we're going to
01:05 - deploy
01:06 - uh before we start i just want to give a
01:08 - shout out because we had another pull
01:10 - request uh so uh seduce i'm not sure i
01:14 - pronounced that it's s-i-d-o-u
01:18 - so let me know how to pronounce that if
01:19 - you're watching or if someone knows how
01:21 - to pronounce that because i'd love to
01:23 - get it right
01:24 - um we had a pull request and it's a
01:26 - restart button so we didn't have a
01:29 - button once you won the game you had to
01:30 - manually refresh the page to go back
01:33 - now we have a restart button button
01:35 - which is a great idea
01:37 - so just want to go through this really
01:39 - quickly
01:40 - is to bring everybody up to speed on
01:42 - what's changed
01:43 - so in our app.js file we now have this
01:49 - handle restart function
01:52 - and that just dispatches an action
01:56 - okay and here's the actual button so
01:58 - just a normal react native button
02:01 - it even has the accessibility label
02:03 - which is awesome
02:07 - and when you press the button it just
02:09 - calls that handle restart function
02:11 - all right and then that triggers the
02:13 - action here in our reducer our
02:15 - appreducer.js
02:18 - and
02:19 - that's going to
02:21 - change our state
02:23 - at some point restart state
02:27 - so we have our mode and our operator so
02:30 - remember the mode is whether it's like
02:32 - multiplication addition you know
02:33 - whatever and then our operator is the
02:36 - actual sign
02:38 - uh
02:38 - that will appear in the ui
02:41 - all right so that's awesome i've already
02:43 - merged this pull request so if you're
02:45 - trying to follow along definitely do a
02:47 - git pull
02:49 - um
02:50 - update or if you forked update your fork
02:53 - uh because those those changes are now
02:55 - in there and that's what
02:57 - what we're gonna work with today uh and
02:59 - hopefully what we're gonna push
03:02 - so uh i see a lot of people are in chat
03:06 - what's up everybody um
03:09 - if you have any questions i'll get to
03:10 - those uh after our first break
03:13 - uh so it looks like
03:15 - there were some questions some of them
03:16 - got addressed by other members of the
03:18 - community here so i think we're good
03:20 - right now somebody just asked for a link
03:22 - to this repo it's in the description to
03:24 - this video
03:25 - along with some other links uh to some
03:27 - of the tools i use
03:29 - some of my social media accounts my
03:31 - youtube channel so this
03:34 - i try to put every link that you might
03:35 - want from the stream in the description
03:37 - so check there first if it's not there
03:39 - then you know by all means ask and i'll
03:41 - i'll put a put the link in the chat or
03:44 - put another link in the description
03:46 - i'm going to start my timer
03:49 - so when this timer is going this 25
03:51 - minute timer
03:53 - i'm mainly just going to be focused on
03:55 - the code and i'm not going to glance
03:57 - over at the chat often once the timer
04:00 - goes off i'm going to go back to the
04:02 - chat and i'm going to try to get through
04:04 - as many of the chat messages i can
04:06 - within like five minutes and then we'll
04:08 - go back to the code
04:09 - uh today we might not
04:12 - we'll see i don't anticipate this work
04:15 - going longer than one 25 minute period
04:17 - and the rest can be for questions but
04:19 - you never know i could mess something up
04:21 - and it could take a lot longer so that
04:24 - if you've seen my previous streams then
04:26 - you know that messing stuff up is
04:29 - uh a frequent occurrence uh on the
04:31 - streams
04:33 - uh let me check
04:36 - i was just checking the stream health
04:37 - quickly before i got started i don't
04:39 - want to get into anything if you all can
04:42 - actually see what's happening all right
04:44 - so here here's our app right um i just
04:47 - want to verify like
04:49 - the things are working before we deploy
04:50 - so let's just go through a round and hit
04:53 - that restart button and then we can
04:55 - deploy
04:57 - um let's see oh you know what i still
05:00 - haven't implemented the enter key to be
05:02 - able to work here and i keep forgetting
05:04 - to do that
05:05 - um
05:06 - so if somebody wants to make an issue in
05:09 - the github repo about that right now
05:11 - then that would be awesome otherwise
05:12 - i'll try to remember to do it this time
05:17 - all right we got that one right
05:19 - i keep trying to hit enter i know it
05:21 - doesn't work
05:25 - all right so now
05:27 - cool it says victory and we have a
05:29 - restart button we can restart yeah and
05:31 - it goes back
05:33 - awesome
05:34 - now let's check out deployment
05:36 - so i don't know if if anyone remembers
05:38 - when we first started this project
05:41 - we did
05:42 - uh we used create react app
05:45 - and
05:46 - it's like in our package json
05:49 - this this might look familiar if any
05:51 - this is like the standard create react
05:53 - app package json the only thing that
05:55 - we've added really i think is
05:58 - react art and
05:59 - react native web everything else is
06:02 - exactly as it is normally in create
06:04 - react app
06:06 - so i thought
06:08 - hey
06:09 - we probably could just deploy this like
06:11 - any
06:12 - create react app app
06:14 - so
06:15 - i've gone to the create react app docs
06:17 - and i went to the deployment section and
06:20 - i'm going to scroll down
06:21 - and get to the some of our different
06:24 - options so you can see we can do azure
06:26 - there's firebase
06:29 - but we're going to try github pages okay
06:31 - so i i considered a few other options
06:33 - for deployment but i think github pages
06:35 - would be nice because it'll keep it all
06:36 - centrally located in github right now
06:39 - um
06:41 - and this is a nice feature like to demo
06:45 - because this costs nothing
06:48 - it's it's pretty simple
06:50 - and it's linked up to your your git
06:52 - commit so every time we push to master
06:55 - it will update our github pages
06:58 - so
07:00 - i think that's probably
07:02 - the simplest way to go at this point
07:06 - all right so a few changes we need to
07:07 - make we need to add this home page
07:10 - right to our
07:12 - package.json so let's just copy and
07:14 - paste and update
07:17 - a bit here
07:19 - so
07:20 - this we can we can add this wherever we
07:21 - want i'm going to add it in right here
07:24 - so we have a home page and this is i got
07:28 - to replace with my username so
07:33 - jessie r weigel and then the name of the
07:35 - app which is
07:39 - battle math
07:42 - i'm going gonna save that i'm i'm gonna
07:44 - double check that i named the github
07:46 - repo the same thing though too
07:48 - yeah battle math
07:50 - occasionally i'll have the project
07:52 - folder locally be named something
07:53 - different than the
07:55 - the github repo so
07:57 - always worth a double check okay so
07:59 - that's step one done
08:03 - can y'all see this font is it too small
08:05 - let me know if it's too small make it
08:07 - bigger
08:10 - you can also go here if you want i'll
08:12 - put the link in the chat right now if
08:14 - you want to check out
08:16 - these um
08:18 - these docs yourself
08:21 - so
08:26 - uh whenever you run npm run build you'll
08:28 - see a cheat sheet with instructions on
08:29 - how to deploy to github pages
08:32 - okay cool
08:33 - um
08:34 - but let's add our deploy scripts
08:37 - right
08:41 - so we're getting we need to add gh pages
08:43 - first of all so the it's a package right
08:46 - so let's go here
08:48 - to our terminal
08:52 - yarn add gh pages so we are using yarn
08:55 - instead of regular npm for this project
08:57 - so i i prefer yarn but regular npm is
09:02 - will definitely work
09:04 - all right cool so now you can see we
09:05 - have gh pages as a dependency
09:11 - and
09:12 - we need to add some scripts so we're
09:14 - going to add a pre-deploy
09:16 - and deploy
09:19 - which this is going to come out weird
09:21 - because of that plus sign but we'll deal
09:22 - with it let me get in there
09:27 - and just
09:29 - deploy
09:35 - okay
09:36 - i was just reading with this set down
09:38 - here and this is only for github user
09:40 - pages and not
09:42 - project pages so we should be good with
09:44 - just this this deploy script
09:46 - all right so let's add these
09:51 - i'm addies here at the bottom let's do
09:53 - that
10:01 - okay so we have our pre-deploy which dis
10:03 - runs our build
10:06 - right
10:07 - and then we have our deploy
10:10 - which will actually
10:11 - use gh pages
10:15 - and deploy
10:17 - i'm assuming build here would be
10:20 - trying to find our build directory right
10:26 - and
10:29 - final step deploy the site by running uh
10:32 - npm run deploy or in this case we can
10:33 - just run yarn deploy
10:36 - and
10:37 - since we set up that pre-deploy and
10:38 - everything
10:40 - i believe
10:43 - this will
10:45 - save us from having to
10:47 - um
10:49 - manually do a build first right so
10:53 - i think the way it'll work is if i hit
10:55 - deploy it'll run plea pre-deploy
10:57 - automatically first
10:58 - let's verify that
11:00 - make sure i save this yep and let's do
11:02 - yarn
11:03 - deploy
11:08 - yep so it looks like it's it's running
11:09 - the build first so now we can see we
11:12 - have a build folder that's appeared
11:15 - what it's doing here is it's going to
11:16 - take
11:18 - all of our components and everything and
11:22 - turn it into
11:23 - a
11:25 - set of javascript files right and so we
11:29 - could looks like it's done so we could
11:30 - check it out so you can see we have
11:33 - a bunch of these like settings files we
11:34 - have an index.html so this can run as a
11:37 - static website basically like you could
11:39 - spin up nginx and just point it to your
11:42 - index.html and it would work
11:47 - so
11:48 - all of our actual files that we made are
11:51 - now in our css and js and you can see
11:53 - they've been
11:56 - so we have our map files
11:58 - but we also have this which is
12:01 - minified
12:03 - javascript
12:05 - and this is all the stuff that we've
12:08 - that we've written
12:10 - uh
12:12 - but it's all kind of condensed down
12:14 - right
12:15 - and we can check out our css this is
12:17 - minified you know css it's all in one
12:20 - line
12:21 - right
12:24 - so that's all that actually gets pushed
12:26 - when you create
12:28 - when you when you use react it's just
12:30 - some javascript and css files just like
12:33 - like that
12:34 - um so it's pretty cool
12:38 - now we have another step on the github
12:41 - side of things
12:42 - so
12:43 - we need to
12:44 - um make sure that we enable github pages
12:48 - the the branch
12:50 - so we'll go into github
12:53 - it should already be yep already in
12:55 - there uh so let's go to the settings for
12:57 - this project
12:59 - so these are the the particular project
13:01 - settings not your your uh profile
13:03 - settings
13:05 - so i think it's on the main page here
13:08 - yep
13:08 - github pages
13:10 - all right great so it automatically did
13:12 - this uh which is awesome
13:14 - um
13:15 - that might be like the default now
13:18 - for some reason i remember like years
13:20 - ago
13:21 - you had to manually set it you couldn't
13:23 - just default it to that but i think
13:25 - maybe that changed or maybe i'm crazy
13:27 - and i'm remembering wrong but it seems
13:29 - to me like at one point this was
13:30 - necessary uh to enable that um and you
13:34 - could point
13:35 - um
13:37 - to different brand you can still point
13:38 - to different branches it looks like all
13:40 - right cool
13:42 - um
13:46 - that should be it let's double check in
13:47 - the docs here but i think that's it
13:50 - all right we don't have to worry about
13:51 - client-side routing at least not yet
13:53 - because we have no routing going on
13:55 - right this is all just one page the url
13:57 - does not change at all if you did have
14:00 - some routing going on it's a little bit
14:02 - more difficult to use github pages but
14:04 - not
14:05 - impossible
14:08 - okay we have no problem so far so we're
14:10 - not going to troubleshoot and that's it
14:12 - okay and you can see there are other
14:13 - options like if you want to deploy in
14:14 - heroku
14:16 - netlify
14:17 - now
14:18 - now was probably what i was going to go
14:20 - with if we didn't do github pages i love
14:23 - now you could check out like some of my
14:24 - earlier streams i i use it
14:28 - that's a great a great way to deploy
14:31 - very simple um s3 cloudfront surge i
14:34 - have you surged before i i usually use
14:37 - search for my presentations like my
14:39 - conference talks and stuff uh i always
14:41 - do my slides as react repos
14:45 - and i deploy them like
14:47 - with with search
14:50 - oh and you can publish to npm that's
14:53 - pretty cool i didn't realize that was
14:55 - oh i guess it's not built built-in
14:57 - functionality
14:59 - so you have to use a tool okay
15:00 - all right awesome now we should be able
15:03 - to go here
15:04 - and see our site
15:07 - alright awesome and you can see
15:09 - everything's small again because i
15:10 - didn't
15:11 - increase the size artificially but
15:14 - let's just test it out make sure it
15:16 - works um
15:18 - what's that 11
15:21 - 4
15:24 - let's get one wrong
15:27 - cool
15:29 - 12.
15:35 - six
15:37 - all right awesome
15:38 - and we should be able to switch
15:40 - and get these crazy changes
15:45 - alright cool
15:46 - so now
15:47 - let me put that link
15:49 - in
15:50 - the
15:54 - there in the the chat and i also want
15:56 - this link to show up
15:58 - um on our github
16:00 - repo so
16:03 - let's go back in here and let's provide
16:06 - here our website right
16:09 - and we may as well give a little
16:10 - description
16:23 - there we go so now
16:24 - when anyone comes to our our repo
16:27 - uh not only can they see our code but
16:29 - they could click right here to get
16:32 - uh the actual app
16:34 - okay um so that's cool and i mean of
16:37 - course you can put any url you want
16:39 - there you're not limited to github pages
16:41 - um let's see
16:44 - okay we still don't have
16:46 - still i still haven't changed the uh the
16:48 - readme
16:50 - and
16:52 - let's add that issue that i keep talking
16:54 - about right here um
16:56 - so
16:57 - um
17:00 - add
17:01 - sorry
17:03 - what a terrible uh mistake to make on
17:05 - the keyboard if anybody caught that that
17:07 - was like
17:08 - those keys are right next to each other
17:10 - um
17:11 - add
17:12 - submit
17:14 - on enter
17:20 - enter key press
17:22 - okay
17:27 - oh cool wow related issues
17:31 - that's interesting yeah i'm gonna try
17:32 - that has anybody seen this this is a new
17:34 - feature
17:35 - github um
17:37 - will
17:39 - automatically try to find
17:42 - related issues so that you don't make
17:46 - like the same issue again
17:48 - in our small repo not a big deal but on
17:50 - bigger repos this is a big deal of
17:53 - people duplicating issues instead of
17:54 - looking through the backlog of issues so
17:57 - uh yeah i'll definitely try that that's
18:00 - cool
18:01 - uh
18:03 - i'm gonna submit that
18:05 - great
18:07 - all right so now we have two issues
18:14 - and
18:20 - let's see let's check our labels
18:23 - see if we can
18:27 - i want to label both of these
18:29 - as
18:31 - good first issues
18:38 - so they're both pretty pretty basic and
18:43 - help wanted
18:44 - okay
18:46 - oops i didn't
18:48 - i wanted to actually label them as help
18:50 - one and all right label
18:52 - help wanted
18:55 - there we go
18:56 - okay so
18:57 - i like to keep the issues labeled uh in
19:00 - the repos and that way people who come
19:02 - can see
19:05 - uh what issues
19:06 - i would actually want worked on if
19:09 - anyone's interested in working on them
19:10 - sometimes people put in an issue
19:12 - and
19:13 - it it may not be something that i even
19:16 - want in the project
19:18 - but this way everybody knows like
19:20 - yes i do want to help on this issue so
19:22 - it's it's up for grabs and also label
19:25 - these as these are good first issues
19:27 - they're pretty easy this one is
19:29 - involves no coding it's it's just um
19:32 - writing in english
19:36 - although if we want to have readme in
19:37 - different languages i'm cool with that
19:39 - too
19:40 - um
19:41 - and then this one is add submit on enter
19:43 - keypress so a little bit more code
19:45 - involved but this is a pretty common
19:48 - thing uh that we need done in react
19:50 - so um not shouldn't be a too difficult
19:54 - thing to to add in
19:58 - all right let's see
20:04 - sorry about the yawns again
20:08 - all right so here's what i'm going to do
20:10 - we've gotten that done without running
20:12 - down our timer
20:13 - so
20:14 - i'm going to go to the chat now and
20:15 - answer all the questions and we're going
20:17 - to see how much time we have left at
20:19 - that point and determine whether or not
20:21 - we want to code more or
20:22 - just save it for
20:24 - for the next stream
20:27 - okay
20:29 - uh let's see i'm scrolling all the way
20:32 - up to the top try to get through all the
20:34 - chat at this point so if you do have any
20:36 - questions you can put them in the chat
20:37 - now
20:39 - um i'll take you know any questions fine
20:42 - as long as it's not like inappropriate
20:44 - right
20:49 - um sohail wants suggestions for python
20:53 - courses
20:54 - um
20:56 - you know what the
20:59 - udacities
21:00 - udacity has some free courses along with
21:03 - paid nanodegree programs but their intro
21:06 - to computer science i believe is done in
21:08 - python so you would learn python syntax
21:11 - alongside of learning a lot of computer
21:13 - science concepts so i i recommend that
21:24 - we did have a question about like can i
21:26 - watch this even if i've never learned
21:28 - react native and yeah definitely
21:30 - it got answered by other people in the
21:33 - chat which is awesome thank you but just
21:36 - for anybody else who maybe is not
21:37 - looking at the chat
21:39 - don't worry if you don't know react or
21:40 - react native or even javascript or
21:42 - anything right ask as many questions as
21:44 - you need to
21:47 - a lot of this stream is just
21:49 - figuring out problems and figuring out
21:51 - problems is the same no matter what
21:53 - programming language you're using
21:58 - and really in this stream like we didn't
22:00 - even do any javascript stuff we we
22:02 - edited a package json file right this
22:05 - was deployment
22:07 - which
22:09 - in this case required no coding changes
22:24 - edwin says sup
22:26 - how's it going thanks for watching
22:34 - rabbitworks says what's up hey how's it
22:36 - going
22:37 - humberto's here how's it going
22:42 - let's see
22:45 - um
22:47 - someone asked what's this website
22:50 - uh
22:51 - yeah so if you didn't catch at the
22:53 - beginning there
22:54 - it's a game it's a
22:56 - a math game
22:58 - which
22:59 - now we we have it here a basic math game
23:02 - for children it's built with react
23:03 - native web
23:05 - which allows you to build and react
23:06 - native but run it as a web app in a
23:09 - browser
23:11 - we will do builds for android and ios
23:14 - later on too so
23:16 - those are coming
23:17 - and uh if we can think of something else
23:19 - to build to i'm open to doing that too i
23:22 - i actually do want to try out there's a
23:24 - way that you can do a windows 10 app
23:27 - um so i want to try that as well so
23:31 - there'll be more
23:32 - deployments to different uh platforms
23:36 - coming up
23:41 - joodle says i've never watched before so
23:45 - well welcome thanks for watching
24:03 - um there's some discussion about a
24:04 - windows forms app tutorial
24:08 - uh so my moon says anyone know the react
24:11 - and
24:12 - ask.net full stack tutorial
24:15 - um
24:18 - yeah isn't there one
24:19 - i thought there was a video that on on
24:22 - the free code cam channel here that came
24:24 - out like that
24:25 - uh umberto says
24:28 - there was a full c sharp project
24:30 - tutorial by i am tim cory
24:33 - but this his tutorial is for a windows
24:35 - forms app
24:37 - i don't know if you're asking something
24:38 - showing both react and ask.net yeah
24:40 - actually you can do a windows forms like
24:43 - app
24:44 - um
24:45 - and
24:47 - use a chromium embedded framework so
24:49 - there's it's
24:51 - it's called cefsharp cefsharp
24:55 - and
24:56 - you can basically point it to a url with
24:59 - your react app but run it
25:02 - as a windows forms app on windows
25:05 - so that's that's possible
25:08 - it would be like
25:10 - similar to what you can do with electron
25:13 - except you wouldn't actually have your
25:15 - app like
25:16 - packaged right
25:18 - it would be running elsewhere
25:32 - um there actually is a
25:34 - electron.net
25:36 - that lets you use
25:38 - dotnet
25:39 - i believe.net core but i'm not 100 sure
25:43 - but i'll let you use net
25:46 - and
25:47 - react
25:48 - or whatever javascript you want
25:53 - bundle it like an electron app
25:56 - and then run it run it on windows
26:01 - can you hack nasa for me
26:03 - no i can't and even if i could hack nasa
26:06 - i don't think i would do it because i'd
26:08 - get into a lot of trouble for that
26:10 - um
26:12 - we had a question about what what is a
26:14 - react native web app so since i just
26:15 - answered that uh i'm going to skip that
26:17 - question hopefully
26:19 - um so master asked that hopefully you
26:21 - caught the uh the answer there um akeem
26:25 - says this is first time watching welcome
26:26 - akeem thank you so much for watching
26:30 - um
26:31 - let's see
26:33 - rabbitworks says are you going to make
26:34 - this mobile friendly like what was the
26:37 - point for react native for just building
26:39 - a web app okay so
26:42 - like i i think i just mentioned this
26:44 - we're we're gonna do
26:45 - mobile apps
26:47 - um as well and maybe desktop apps so
26:51 - this is just stage one uh i think in
26:54 - some of the like the earlier streams
26:56 - like day one or day two i explained more
26:58 - about like why
27:00 - um
27:02 - why i'm doing it like this so if you
27:04 - want a fuller explanation then
27:06 - check that out there but yeah we're
27:09 - the web is just the first step for this
27:11 - project
27:21 - um umberto had tried to post a link to a
27:24 - net project uh tutorial and it got
27:26 - blocked so i just uh showed that link so
27:30 - if you're interested in that scroll up a
27:31 - little bit and find umberto's link
27:35 - it's it's now visible
27:52 - no face says how's it going you still
27:54 - need to improve the colors yeah for sure
27:57 - we need to improve the colors i know i
27:58 - said i would
28:00 - uh maybe be able to look up some color
28:02 - schemes but i i didn't things have been
28:04 - really busy at work
28:06 - and at home
28:08 - for those of you don't know i have four
28:09 - kids
28:10 - uh and they're all
28:12 - small so nine and under uh so i
28:14 - obviously am busy with that but also i'm
28:16 - in the process of buying a new house uh
28:19 - for my family so we're trying to pack up
28:21 - everything now and i'm talking with like
28:24 - banks to get a loan and a realtor and
28:27 - insurance people so
28:29 - it's been busier than normal i'm also
28:31 - trying to be healthy so i've been going
28:33 - in a couple days a week going into work
28:35 - early and working out at the gym there
28:37 - so
28:38 - i have less time than normal
28:41 - so
28:42 - i'm trying to keep up with the stream as
28:45 - best i can because i i think it's it's a
28:47 - really awesome thing and uh so
28:51 - i'm gonna keep trying to make sure i
28:52 - carve out some time for this stream but
28:54 - i don't have a lot of time to work on
28:56 - this project
28:57 - aside from my stream time
29:07 - run says hello from japan hey how's it
29:09 - going what time is it right now in japan
29:16 - uh dave asked does anyone know if these
29:18 - are recorded here yes they are so you
29:21 - can check it out all the videos of this
29:23 - project are in their own playlist
29:26 - i think it's
29:28 - react native web project playlist or
29:30 - something like that and then every live
29:32 - stream that i've ever done for free code
29:34 - camp is in a giant playlist called live
29:36 - coding with jesse
29:41 - and i also have
29:43 - other live streams and tutorial videos
29:46 - on my youtube channel the links in the
29:47 - description
29:52 - uh mustafa says udemy has some great
29:54 - python courses okay so i haven't checked
29:56 - out any python courses on udemy or udemy
29:59 - i don't know how you say that i've heard
30:01 - both um
30:02 - but
30:04 - i've seen some other good courses on
30:05 - there for other languages so that's
30:07 - probably a good place to check
30:09 - um
30:10 - dave says thanks for this jesse is this
30:13 - a series
30:15 - and uh for bass foundational idiots like
30:18 - me know nothing about react
30:20 - uh well don't be so don't be hard on
30:22 - yourself
30:23 - um
30:25 - yeah this series i i want this it is a
30:27 - series and i want this series to be as
30:31 - beginner friendly as possible
30:33 - um
30:34 - we work on stuff sometimes that's really
30:36 - beginner friendly and sometimes we work
30:38 - on
30:39 - things that are
30:41 - um more advanced
30:43 - uh but i'm always open for questions
30:46 - even if you have a question you think is
30:48 - just so basic don't worry about it
30:51 - i'd love to answer the question there
30:53 - are probably
30:54 - um
30:56 - a lot of other people that are have the
30:58 - same question either live or that we'll
31:00 - watch later
31:02 - so and it's good and it's a good
31:03 - opportunity for me to
31:06 - make sure i understand the basic stuff
31:09 - um as i explain it right and it helps me
31:12 - to realize what i don't know
31:14 - you know if i get questions i have no
31:15 - idea what they are then
31:17 - i know where there are like holes in my
31:19 - learning right so it's
31:21 - i love the questions and um if there's
31:24 - anything i can do
31:25 - to help for beginners like speak up
31:28 - i mean i want to make real projects so
31:30 - it can't always be beginner level but i
31:33 - still want to try to be helpful
31:40 - okay dave said there are also python
31:42 - courses in edx and coursera
31:44 - and free okay
31:46 - um
31:47 - m-i-u-p
31:49 - all caps says uh is coding hard
31:52 - uh i'll say this
31:53 - it can be
31:55 - right um
31:56 - there are parts of coding that seem
31:59 - pretty easy and there are parts that
32:00 - seem pretty hard
32:01 - uh it it just kind of depends on what
32:03 - you're working on like
32:05 - and when i first started out a lot of it
32:07 - seemed hard
32:09 - now that i've been doing it for a while
32:10 - there's a lot of stuff that's easy but
32:12 - now there's even more stuff that i
32:14 - didn't even know about
32:15 - that is hard right so
32:18 - um
32:20 - that's i think that's cool though right
32:22 - there it's there's always a challenge in
32:25 - programming
32:26 - um
32:27 - so it's like anything if you want to be
32:29 - good at it you have to practice so i'm
32:31 - not going to say it's impossible
32:34 - it's because it's certainly not it's
32:35 - doable for anybody
32:37 - but it just takes work
32:55 - facundo says can you clean your room
32:57 - it's disgusting
32:59 - you can't even see it
33:02 - i have a bookshelf
33:04 - and some uh
33:07 - some tablecloths hanging up
33:10 - anyway this is my basement so this is
33:12 - not my room it's a corner of my basement
33:14 - right now so
33:15 - i am going to get a real office when i
33:17 - move
33:18 - um
33:19 - i'm going to have space
33:21 - to build an office so this is just
33:23 - temporary
33:28 - um
33:30 - let's see
33:34 - no faces how about have math questions
33:36 - moving down or across the screen and you
33:38 - must answer each question before they
33:40 - reach the edge of the screen
33:42 - that would be a cool mode i don't want
33:43 - that to be the base mode because um
33:46 - that's like an added level of stress for
33:49 - people who are just learning but i think
33:50 - that would be a cool like advanced mode
33:55 - we also we have people saying hello from
33:57 - just all over the world so i'm kind of
33:58 - just skipping those for time but i do
34:00 - see them and hello i appreciate it
34:15 - let's see
34:18 - um creative girl says hello is the free
34:21 - co
34:21 - curriculum uh the same as the free
34:24 - character and coke videos free code cam
34:26 - videos on youtube um no so the the
34:28 - curriculum is is different
34:30 - um it
34:32 - it covers a lot of stuff so basically
34:34 - like full stack web development is
34:35 - covered in the curriculum it is um
34:39 - i guess we should just go there right
34:40 - now
34:42 - so freecodecamp.org has this uh this
34:45 - curriculum
34:48 - so if you
34:52 - if you like kind of go through a little
34:54 - bit uh let me try to find one
34:56 - i wonder if it'll let me just go into
34:58 - one
34:59 - there we go so
35:00 - like in in a lot of the lessons
35:04 - it gives you a little instruction here
35:06 - and then you have a little spot where
35:08 - you can like type stuff
35:10 - uh and it will show up here
35:13 - right so you have like a code editor and
35:15 - then it live refreshes
35:17 - all right and then some of the later
35:19 - lessons
35:20 - you actually have
35:23 - um
35:24 - there's the projects running libraries
35:27 - so you'll you'll have
35:29 - these objectives user stories so
35:32 - you build it on your own using your own
35:34 - tools
35:36 - right
35:38 - but yeah they're not linked to the
35:40 - videos the videos could be helpful
35:41 - resources to learn how to do that but
35:44 - they are
35:45 - separate separate programs
35:47 - good question
35:50 - um
35:52 - the valerie i don't i'm sorry i'm
35:55 - messing up your name v-a-l-e-r-i-n
35:58 - says uh first time watching this uh
36:01 - thanks for watching
36:02 - and i hope you like it let me know if
36:05 - there's anything anything i can do to
36:06 - make it better
36:07 - um
36:08 - let's see
36:11 - it says how long will this video be uh
36:14 - we'll probably go for another
36:16 - i think i'm almost to the bottom
36:17 - something in like maybe another 10
36:19 - minutes
36:23 - let's see
36:24 - um
36:26 - uh fakie says
36:28 - p7 stands for part seven
36:31 - um
36:32 - project seven all right yeah maybe i
36:34 - should explain that so the videos all
36:36 - have
36:36 - um
36:38 - this
36:39 - it'll have like to today's is p7d8 so
36:42 - that's project seven day eight so this
36:44 - is the seventh project that i've done on
36:47 - free code camp um live coding with jesse
36:50 - series
36:51 - and this is day eight
36:56 - so that's another good question
36:59 - so each project
37:02 - has its own
37:04 - playlist
37:07 - but also if if you were just looking at
37:09 - the big playlist of all the projects you
37:12 - could easily see which project
37:14 - and which day of the project were on
37:24 - um
37:26 - cuadwell says got four kids two bro i
37:29 - feel you all right you know how it is i
37:31 - love them i love i love kids i love my
37:33 - kids but four kids is
37:36 - um
37:37 - is a lot of work like i want to
37:40 - like i want to make sure i spend time
37:42 - with each kid
37:43 - every day
37:44 - so
37:46 - a lot of the time that i do have
37:48 - where i don't have to work
37:50 - um
37:51 - is taken up by that
37:53 - uh so it's just like yesterday i came
37:55 - home
37:56 - um and
37:59 - my two-year-old wanted me to read her a
38:01 - book
38:02 - and then my nine-year-old has been doing
38:04 - some like really basic computer
38:06 - programming and building like minecraft
38:08 - stuff and he wanted to show me all the
38:09 - stuff that he did so i went there then i
38:11 - went back out and read my four-year-old
38:13 - a book
38:14 - um and then
38:16 - i
38:17 - um
38:18 - grabbed something to eat really quick as
38:20 - i was starving and uh
38:23 - then i went and sat down and helped my
38:25 - uh seven-year-old with her math homework
38:28 - and then at that point it was time to
38:29 - get them all ready for bed so i did all
38:32 - that so it's just um
38:35 - uh it's busy right like you just
38:37 - you know if you're trying to be a good
38:39 - dad and spend time with your kids like
38:40 - there's not a lot of time left for
38:42 - anything else
38:45 - but again like
38:47 - i love the kids like
38:49 - i love being able to spend time with
38:51 - them so
38:52 - um not a complaint just
38:54 - just the way it is
39:00 - um
39:02 - yo says uh
39:04 - hello what i miss um
39:08 - we deployed to github pages that's
39:10 - pretty much what we did today
39:12 - so if you want to see how that went uh
39:14 - you could always check out the uh the
39:15 - replay of this that will be available a
39:17 - few minutes after i end the stream
39:20 - uh
39:22 - majid says i'm studying unity 3d i want
39:25 - help please i don't know anything about
39:27 - that so i can't help you but if anybody
39:30 - else is watching um and can offer some
39:32 - help you know throw a comment here in
39:34 - the in the chat please
39:37 - mario says thumbs up for you thank you i
39:39 - appreciate that
39:40 - uh
39:42 - we have a question not sure how to
39:44 - pronounce that so
39:45 - uh but the question is hello can i pass
39:48 - my app and react js to react native is
39:51 - this easy
39:53 - it depends on how big your app is and
39:55 - how much you've done
39:57 - you can't
39:59 - there's not an easy way to convert
40:01 - react app to react native app
40:04 - as far as i know
40:06 - if it was a small enough react app
40:09 - maybe it would be doable um
40:12 - like i've i've done it
40:14 - but i've never done it with a
40:17 - full-on fully developed app right it's
40:19 - usually like at an early point in the
40:21 - project i make the switch
40:24 - so yeah it may be difficult to do it's
40:27 - not impossible to do but it may be
40:29 - difficult
40:36 - on mpg
40:38 - says um
40:41 - in terms of performance is there any bad
40:43 - side effect for running python node.js
40:45 - php or other as a service in the same
40:47 - machine
40:49 - um
40:51 - i don't really know i mean the more
40:52 - stuff you run on a machine like you're
40:55 - gonna have performance
40:57 - effect but it just depends like what are
40:59 - you running and how powerful is that
41:01 - machine
41:06 - uh the rasboy says is it open source yep
41:09 - yeah everything we do on the stream is
41:11 - open source
41:12 - so feel free to use it for whatever you
41:14 - want i don't think i added a license yet
41:17 - uh
41:18 - we should do that release making s let's
41:21 - make another issue for that
41:26 - and mit
41:30 - add mit license
41:35 - i'm a new issue all right now at least i
41:37 - won't forget to do that
41:46 - dave says wow you made my day i can't
41:48 - believe this is free plus my monthly
41:50 - donation to free code camp um that's
41:53 - awesome that you donate to free code
41:54 - camp so uh thank you for that
41:57 - but yeah everything free code camp does
41:59 - is is free
42:02 - hey nikki's here says uh good morning um
42:06 - or noon what what time is it where
42:08 - you're at everybody well where i am it's

43:09 - donchi says uh it's 2pm in germany
43:14 - that's cool jeremy i had the opportunity
43:17 - to go speak at a conference in germany
43:19 - um
43:20 - at the
43:21 - end of so like in november maybe i think
43:23 - it was november
43:24 - i was in munich it was awesome
43:26 - um
43:28 - i really liked it there
43:32 - uh creative girl says i have a problem
43:34 - about the method of learning code what's
43:36 - the effective way just following
43:38 - tutorials learning on free code camp and
43:40 - knowing the whole curriculum from start
43:41 - to finish is boring
43:43 - yeah i
43:44 - doing the entire curriculum from start
43:46 - to finish
43:47 - you know i
43:49 - i didn't do that right so usually like
43:52 - you do some stuff on the curriculum you
43:53 - do some real projects you switch it up
43:56 - with some videos some other tutorials
43:59 - like that's the route that i went like i
44:01 - learned what i had to learn to get
44:02 - projects done
44:04 - because i was freelancing at the same
44:05 - time as i was learning right
44:07 - um so
44:09 - yeah i would say switch switch up your
44:12 - modes of learning whether it's
44:15 - tutorial
44:16 - uh like free code cam tutorial or video
44:20 - or a blog post a book you know whatever
44:23 - if you get too bored with one switch it
44:25 - up to the other you know that's totally
44:26 - fine sometimes you just need to work on
44:28 - a project you know and just like
44:31 - try stuff see if it works look at
44:32 - documentation right um
44:35 - you know do what you have to do to keep
44:37 - things like fresh for you
44:39 - um you know you definitely aren't
44:42 - you don't have to stick with just doing
44:44 - the curriculum all the time you know
44:47 - hopefully that helps answer your
44:49 - question a little bit uh let me know if
44:51 - it doesn't
44:54 - uh min says hola amigo
44:56 - hola
45:01 - let's see
45:05 - muhammad says sadly i have to go back to
45:07 - work is this going to be available later
45:09 - yes it definitely will be the recording
45:10 - will be available
45:13 - james says it's 4 p.m in kenya
45:20 - uh varun says when will the next project
45:22 - start uh whenever we get done with this
45:24 - one so i'm not sure
45:26 - i just depends on how this goes you know
45:28 - if if it gets fun and we start working
45:30 - on it and adding features maybe it'll go
45:32 - for a little while
45:33 - um
45:35 - if it doesn't seem like there's a lot of
45:36 - interest then we'll figure out another
45:38 - project to start and to work on
45:43 - it's it's
45:45 - pm in indonesia all right that's a huge
45:48 - difference
45:51 - um
45:53 - let's see
45:57 - is it difficult going from react to
45:59 - react native so this is from tom
46:01 - um no i don't it's not very difficult at
46:04 - all there's just a few things that are
46:06 - different
46:07 - um
46:08 - once you kind of get past those few
46:10 - things it's very very similar like your
46:12 - life cycle methods are the same the way
46:14 - state and props work is the same right
46:16 - it's
46:17 - most of the core react concepts are
46:19 - exactly the same
46:22 - uh nikki says what are your thoughts on
46:24 - google stadia from a technical
46:25 - standpoint i think it's awesome but i'm
46:27 - also scared for everything it means like
46:29 - you own nothing everything can be
46:31 - monitored etc
46:33 - actually wow i never thought about that
46:35 - that's a good point so yes so if you
46:38 - haven't seen google stadia
46:39 - look for it on youtube i'm sure there's
46:42 - a lot of videos about it
46:44 - but it's like basically google will live
46:47 - stream games
46:48 - not just like watching somebody else
46:50 - play but you can play the game as a
46:53 - stream in your browser so you don't need
46:55 - a powerful pc or the latest console to
46:58 - play
46:59 - the best games
47:01 - you know at high resolutions
47:04 - you just basically need something
47:05 - capable of
47:07 - streaming content so that could be a
47:09 - phone tablet
47:11 - television
47:14 - obviously a computer right
47:18 - i think that's awesome i think it is
47:20 - really cool that you don't have to put
47:21 - that big investment into hardware to be
47:23 - able to play
47:24 - but i didn't think about that idea that
47:26 - yes like you won't own any games
47:29 - so that does kind of stink although any
47:32 - more like
47:34 - you don't really have physical so many
47:36 - things are digital downloads now
47:38 - it's almost to that point i mean i know
47:41 - like technically you own it and you've
47:42 - downloaded it but
47:44 - i don't know for me mentally i'm like
47:46 - more used to that part but the idea too
47:48 - that everything is monitored
47:51 - guess that's weird i mean i do take it
47:53 - for granted like any game you play
47:55 - online can already be monitored but now
47:58 - i suppose like even an offline game
48:01 - would be monitored as well
48:04 - uh so yeah i didn't think about that
48:07 - so i don't know what i think about that
48:09 - because i just
48:11 - i have to think more on that
48:13 - um
48:15 - probably my gut reaction is like you
48:17 - know what like
48:20 - what
48:22 - i guess it doesn't really matter if
48:24 - google knows like what video games i
48:25 - play um
48:27 - but there could be some issues that i'm
48:29 - just not thinking about
48:30 - uh so
48:32 - yeah i guess there's good and bad to it
48:35 - uh let's see h s
48:38 - b e t e i'm not yeah i don't know that
48:41 - how to say that name but anyway says
48:43 - you're doing the lord's work man with a
48:45 - uh like a fist emoji so thank you i
48:47 - appreciate that
48:49 - um
48:50 - run says it's 10 12 p.m in japan
48:53 - i am sleepy but i want to watch this
48:55 - video all right that that might be the
48:57 - biggest time difference right 10 12 p.m
49:01 - yeah that's that's pretty crazy
49:04 - um dave says how many coffees have you
49:07 - had pre-9am to be pumped enough to do
49:10 - this are you an early bird it's 12 13
49:12 - a.m in australia wow
49:15 - wow that's
49:17 - okay so
49:19 - actually
49:20 - i haven't had any coffee so um
49:22 - like for for catholic people right now
49:25 - it's it's lent and during that time of
49:27 - the year like
49:29 - we we give up something
49:31 - um
49:34 - we it's been like a sacrifice right we
49:36 - give up so i decided that i'm only gonna
49:38 - drink water
49:40 - throughout the time period of lent so i
49:43 - actually haven't had any coffee i
49:45 - haven't had any coffee for weeks now
49:47 - and i love coffee
49:49 - and my wife makes espresso every morning
49:51 - and i smell it and it's i always smell
49:53 - it at work
49:56 - but it's a little sacrifice really like
49:58 - it's not
50:00 - compared to what a lot of other people
50:01 - do on a daily basis like it's not a big
50:04 - deal but
50:05 - it is hard in the mornings right like
50:07 - trying to get pumped in the morning is
50:09 - difficult
50:14 - normally i would have definitely had
50:15 - like at least a couple shots of espresso
50:25 - dave says what did you do jesse to get
50:27 - where you are from square one did you
50:29 - have a different career um
50:31 - like do you have a blog
50:33 - um etc so i do have a youtube channel
50:36 - and i do have some videos on that
50:38 - channel kind of explaining like how i
50:40 - got here so you check those out
50:42 - i think i have a whole video on like my
50:44 - path to becoming a developer
50:46 - so
50:47 - you get a better explanation there but
50:49 - like the short explanation is like i
50:51 - started freelancing
50:53 - um i have a business degree originally i
50:57 - had a couple of just kind of like
51:00 - jobs just to pay the bills right a
51:02 - manager at a fast food place a waiter
51:05 - um i was a high school teacher for a
51:07 - little bit and then i decided like
51:10 - i hooked up with um
51:13 - a friend of mine uh who had a media
51:15 - marketing business and needed someone to
51:17 - do some like freelance contracting work
51:20 - so
51:20 - that's how i got into the coding stuff
51:23 - and started getting my own clients
51:25 - um and then eventually got a full-time
51:27 - job
51:28 - as a front-end developer and now i'm a
51:31 - software engineer
51:33 - so
51:34 - that's like the very short version of my
51:35 - story like i said you can get a longer
51:37 - version on my youtube channel uh links
51:39 - in the description to my channel
51:43 - um
51:44 - [Music]
51:46 - zelalum says how about java uh i haven't
51:49 - done anything with java so
51:52 - um
51:54 - sorry about that i'm not the person to
51:55 - ask about any java stuff
51:57 - um donchi says how can i get started to
52:00 - contribute to open source when do i know
52:02 - i'm ready you're ready when you
52:07 - get a pull request merged right like
52:10 - that's it you know don't
52:12 - try
52:13 - the worst that can happen if you submit
52:15 - a pull request is it doesn't get merged
52:17 - right so just if you see a project and
52:20 - you think like hey i think i can do this
52:22 - i think i can fix this issue just give
52:24 - it a shot try it
52:26 - right like
52:28 - so you don't get it merged like maybe
52:30 - somebody will be mean to you right
52:32 - hopefully it wouldn't happen but it's
52:34 - possible but that's bait that is the the
52:36 - worst thing that could happen really
52:38 - uh and that's not that bad so just give
52:41 - it a try
52:43 - maybe
52:44 - they'll come back and say actually could
52:46 - you fix this or that right and then hey
52:48 - that's awesome because now you're you're
52:50 - getting like some mentoring happening
52:52 - right
52:53 - um
52:54 - but give it a shot maybe you'll get
52:56 - accepted and then once you get that
52:57 - first pull request accepted and merged
52:59 - like you've contributed to open source
53:01 - you're an open source contributor so
53:04 - it's it's definitely a scary thing to
53:07 - get started it was for me for sure
53:10 - but
53:12 - i'd say the only way to know when you're
53:14 - ready is is to actually do it you know
53:16 - give it a try
53:20 - um
53:22 - let's see
53:25 - wired roach says it's 9 16 p.m in the
53:27 - philippines
53:28 - uh let's see do you have any advice for
53:30 - freelancing i'm not sure where to start
53:32 - but i
53:32 - really want that real world experience
53:37 - i'd say the best thing to do would be
53:39 - talk to people in your local area even
53:41 - like talk to family just let people know
53:43 - that you're interested you're interested
53:45 - in doing some work
53:47 - if you really really can't find any work
53:49 - anywhere you could always pick a company
53:51 - that has a terrible website
53:53 - redo their website without even asking
53:56 - them like just do a prototype and then
53:59 - show it to them and say like hey this is
54:01 - what i did or would you be interested in
54:03 - anything like that
54:05 - at the very worst they say no and you've
54:07 - gotten some good practice right
54:09 - um you could try some of those
54:10 - freelancing websites
54:13 - i have didn't ever really have that much
54:15 - luck with the freelancing websites but
54:17 - you know some people
54:19 - some people do um so that's another
54:21 - option
54:22 - but really like just trying to make
54:24 - those connections among friends family
54:26 - people in your community that will
54:28 - spread and then that like they'll tell
54:31 - other people like hey i know this person
54:33 - that can do this work
54:34 - and that's how you'll really start to
54:36 - get uh more freelance business
54:40 - uh i stay julian says do you know how to
54:43 - connect my sequel to json
54:46 - um
54:48 - i
54:48 - i mean i don't know what the official
54:50 - way to do it but i mean basically like
54:53 - if you had an api that would accept json
54:56 - and then save it to a mysql database
54:58 - like that's that's the way to do that
55:00 - you could pretty much do that in
55:01 - whatever language you're comfortable
55:02 - with
55:04 - so
55:05 - i i don't
55:07 - i mean like step by step i don't know
55:09 - like
55:10 - off the top of my head how i would code
55:12 - that but
55:13 - um
55:14 - that would be
55:16 - that would be my approach if i had to do
55:18 - that
55:19 - i would say like all right let's
55:21 - set up my sql backlink and connect it to
55:24 - an api that accepts json
55:26 - and then
55:27 - puts the data in the database right
55:34 - uh robust misconception says jokes aside
55:37 - how long will it be until web
55:38 - development is
55:40 - um
55:42 - fully automated
55:44 - uh actually will it ever be
55:46 - i don't know if it'll ever be but who
55:48 - knows right like trying to predict what
55:50 - will happen in the future is
55:52 - i mean just you're just guessing right
55:54 - um
55:55 - yeah so i don't think it's going to be
55:57 - fully automated mated anytime soon
56:01 - but will it ever be i don't maybe
56:05 - oh also i skipped one uh robust
56:07 - misconception says it's uh 1420 in north
56:10 - macedonia
56:12 - uh
56:20 - reacts
56:21 - uh is is react
56:24 - a bit hard to learn for the first time i
56:26 - know javascript but i'm not an expert i
56:28 - don't think react is actually that hard
56:30 - to learn
56:31 - um
56:33 - it's it's not like you pick it up
56:35 - immediately right it takes a little bit
56:37 - of work but i don't think it's it's too
56:39 - difficult so like don't be afraid to
56:41 - learn react it's it's pretty
56:45 - the concepts are pretty straightforward
56:47 - it's just a matter of like shifting the
56:48 - way you think about how to interact with
56:50 - the dom
56:52 - and once you understand like
56:54 - that you only ever change state and
56:56 - never change the dom directly
56:59 - then i i think
57:01 - it starts to like make sense um and it's
57:04 - it's easier to reason about so
57:07 - um
57:08 - but i'd say like
57:10 - you know only one way to find out how
57:12 - hard it is and that's that's to try it
57:14 - right
57:18 - um oh um nikki says in response to the
57:21 - question we had about um contributing to
57:24 - open source uh nikki says a good way to
57:26 - start is to contribute to documentation
57:28 - it's often overlooked and almost always
57:30 - appreciated especially in a friendly
57:32 - environment like the freecodecamp.org
57:34 - guide that is great advice for sure
57:40 - uh muhammad says just joined what are
57:42 - you doing um we're just doing some
57:44 - question and answer right now earlier in
57:46 - the stream we did deploy um
57:48 - our web app uh to github pages
57:52 - um so if you're interested in checking
57:53 - that out you can watch the recording
57:55 - later on
57:58 - um
58:00 - julian says is it possible to make a web
58:03 - in three days to make a website in three
58:05 - days yeah for sure it's possible um
58:09 - a simple website is is pretty easy to
58:11 - make it just it depends on what you need
58:13 - it to do
58:15 - dave says on scrimba tutorial i saw
58:18 - react but i'm not sure the benefit since
58:20 - it looks like javascript and html why
58:23 - learn another framework not joking just
58:25 - confused a little all right yeah that's
58:27 - a legitimate question so
58:29 - um react
58:30 - definitely has some benefits right it's
58:32 - it's um
58:36 - let's see
58:39 - it's definitely a very different way of
58:41 - making websites than just straight
58:43 - javascript and html for sure um like
58:46 - technically speaking there are
58:48 - definitely some performance improvements
58:49 - and things because of the way it
58:51 - actually handles
58:52 - rendering things in the dom
58:55 - uh
58:56 - it
58:57 - also allows for server side rendering
59:00 - like really easy so if you're trying to
59:02 - make a
59:03 - progressive web app or single page
59:05 - application
59:06 - it's a lot easier to make that search
59:09 - engine friendly
59:11 - with react than it would be like let's
59:13 - say if you made your own
59:14 - like javascript web app or even using
59:17 - something like jquery or something right
59:19 - so
59:19 - um
59:21 - there there are definitely benefits so
59:26 - i guess
59:29 - i'm trying to think of a resource that
59:30 - would list them i don't know about a
59:31 - resource right now
59:33 - and um
59:36 - but that is a good question like why
59:37 - another framework right
59:40 - um but yeah i would there's
59:43 - uh
59:45 - in general
59:46 - like i would say yeah like why why learn
59:48 - another framework that's usually my
59:50 - mentality too
59:51 - um but i do believe that react fills
59:56 - a
59:56 - it has a purpose and it makes
59:59 - making web apps a whole lot easier like
60:01 - i from from coming from making web apps
60:04 - with just regular javascript or a bit of
60:06 - jquery and html to then making web apps
60:09 - with react
60:11 - uh
60:12 - it's so much easier with react right
60:14 - things that were
60:16 - the source of a lot of frustration and
60:18 - bugs now like
60:20 - i don't even have to think about and it
60:22 - just works right really really simple
60:28 - all right uh ibrahim says hey i just did
60:31 - my first pull request on this project
60:32 - should i comment or something else uh to
60:35 - point to related issue um
60:40 - oh awesome
60:41 - yeah you can
60:42 - you can add it to an issue if you just
60:45 - comment with um like the number of the
60:47 - issue i think it'll automatically tag it
60:50 - um
60:52 - yeah i think it will
60:53 - uh but anyway that's awesome thank you
60:56 - so much
60:58 - uh so i'll um
61:00 - i'll get that pulled in soon or maybe
61:02 - i'll pull it in like live on the next
61:04 - stream but i definitely appreciate that
61:07 - um
61:11 - i think cozy
61:13 - thing cozy sorry if i'm mispronouncing
61:15 - that says getting uh advice on getting
61:18 - an internship as a front-end developer
61:19 - if i have html css javascript basics and
61:22 - es6 c some vam and some python um
61:27 - i would like
61:28 - apply so first of all like keep applying
61:30 - for internships but also try to like
61:33 - network and get um
61:35 - so if there's any conferences you can go
61:37 - to or meetups or events
61:40 - try to go to those try to talk to people
61:42 - that
61:43 - may be looking for interns right like
61:46 - let people know be active on social
61:49 - media like especially twitter
61:52 - and let people know
61:54 - that you want an internship
61:57 - so that's it i mean sometimes it takes a
61:59 - while and you gotta you gotta do a lot
62:00 - of
62:02 - you know trying to connect with people
62:05 - but that's
62:06 - that's definitely the way to go
62:09 - um
62:11 - nice
62:12 - nicely says
62:14 - sorry about the pronunciation says what
62:16 - do you think is the best marketing
62:18 - strategies to sell our web mobile app
62:21 - development service
62:23 - um
62:25 - i don't know
62:29 - i guess it depends like on what market
62:31 - you're targeting if it's just maybe like
62:32 - small business markets then
62:35 - you know you could like locally go to
62:37 - like um
62:39 - uh business groups like a lot of times
62:41 - cities have a chamber of commerce that a
62:43 - lot of business leaders are in sometimes
62:45 - you can convince the chamber of commerce
62:47 - commerce to let you speak at one of
62:49 - their meetings and demo what you're
62:51 - doing
62:52 - um
62:53 - you could
62:55 - just cold call a lot of businesses you
62:57 - know just call them up say here's my
62:58 - product can i get a
63:00 - you know can i do a demo can i do
63:02 - something right like
63:04 - um that's hard work it takes a lot but
63:07 - that
63:08 - that also is a possibility
63:11 - um you could think about doing targeted
63:13 - advertising
63:14 - right so those would be off the top of
63:16 - my head those are my my ideas
63:19 - but you know i haven't
63:22 - i haven't been in the freelance business
63:24 - for a while so i guess i'm a little bit
63:26 - rusty on like marketing myself and my
63:28 - services
63:31 - so i would definitely get another
63:32 - opinion too
63:34 - run says which is easier python or
63:36 - javascript
63:38 - um
63:39 - i don't i don't really know i mean
63:41 - python syntax is kind of cool because
63:43 - you don't really have a lot of special
63:44 - characters
63:46 - but
63:48 - i don't know if that necessarily makes
63:50 - it easier
63:54 - all right
63:55 - let me i'm going to log in real quick to
63:57 - my email for work to make sure i'm not
63:58 - missing anything important
64:09 - i'm almost
64:10 - done with the live chat here
64:14 - uh let's see
64:16 - daniel says amazing work jesse i'm
64:18 - almost done with the full stack track of
64:20 - free code camp what advice can you give
64:23 - to a nigerian looking for work in the
64:25 - u.s
64:26 - um
64:28 - i guess like just keep working on
64:30 - projects
64:31 - um definitely like work on your your
64:33 - written and spoken english
64:36 - for sure you're written english right
64:38 - because people won't
64:40 - um
64:41 - if they're looking at a resume or
64:43 - something and they see that the english
64:44 - is not exactly right like that might
64:47 - have a negative impact i mean it
64:49 - you know so just make sure like in terms
64:52 - of like the american style right of
64:56 - of writing right try to like
64:59 - match that
65:00 - because i do like i see resumes from
65:04 - people from other countries and a lot of
65:06 - times they're way different than what
65:07 - people in the u.s expect so like make
65:09 - sure
65:11 - that you look at like u.s type of
65:14 - resumes online and try to match that
65:16 - right because that can be a big turn off
65:18 - to employers if they see something
65:20 - really different and they think like
65:22 - you know doesn't this person know you're
65:24 - not supposed to do that or right so like
65:27 - i would say that would definitely be
65:28 - helpful like as a non-coding thing but
65:30 - in terms of coding like
65:33 - always be working on projects make sure
65:35 - you put it out on github open source if
65:37 - you can
65:38 - uh so that
65:41 - people in the us can see how good your
65:44 - your quality of work is and then you
65:46 - know just keep applying to like
65:48 - everything that you can think of don't
65:50 - be afraid to apply to stuff that you
65:52 - don't feel like you're qualified for
65:54 - you never know you you could definitely
65:56 - get
65:57 - you know someone could give you a shot
65:59 - um
66:00 - so just keep keep after it
66:05 - um karth karthikey says can i add mit
66:09 - license on your project
66:10 - um yeah for sure that would be awesome
66:13 - thank you
66:14 - uh
66:15 - fn cozy says does experience always
66:18 - count i am second year student doing
66:20 - software dev uh i have more knowledge of
66:22 - languages than personal projects
66:24 - experience
66:25 - yeah well i mean you got to think of it
66:27 - this way right like
66:29 - it's hard for a company to know your
66:31 - knowledge of languages
66:33 - it's much easier to be able to see
66:35 - someone's github portfolio or see the
66:37 - projects they did right so it's all
66:39 - about what can you prove to an employer
66:42 - so
66:43 - you need to have something to show your
66:46 - knowledge right
66:48 - so that's why
66:49 - the the actual projects and things are
66:52 - are important
66:53 - so
66:54 - um
66:55 - yes like you may get coding interviews
66:57 - and stuff but
66:59 - being able to even get to the point of
67:01 - having an interview
67:02 - somebody's going to look at your resume
67:04 - and they're going to want to see your
67:05 - projects and stuff before they even
67:07 - think about actually talking to you
67:10 - so
67:11 - try to make sure you do have projects
67:14 - like i know for me if i'm looking at
67:16 - resumes and i see somebody doesn't even
67:18 - have a github uh
67:21 - um
67:23 - github
67:24 - account at all like they don't even show
67:26 - it to me like i'm way less likely to
67:28 - recommend that that person actually be
67:30 - interviewed
67:31 - because
67:32 - i then have no idea if they really know
67:35 - what they're talking about
67:37 - right
67:38 - so that would be my advice is
67:40 - you know at least from my perspective
67:43 - that's what i look at it's like i want
67:45 - to see the code because the code is to
67:47 - me is the proof
67:48 - uh that you
67:50 - actually know what what to do
67:54 - um
67:55 - all right cool okay so i've gotten
67:57 - through all the questions so i'm gonna
67:58 - finish up now and uh get to work on
68:02 - some more react native uh for my my
68:04 - normal job
68:06 - and i'm gonna try to be back

68:11 - have to go into work friday so i'm i may
68:13 - not be able to do a stream but anyway
