00:00 - hello world in today's video we are
00:02 - continuing with s free and we are going
00:05 - to perform some basic operations on a
00:08 - file like getting the file from the s
00:10 - free bucket and saving the file back to
00:12 - this free bucket this video we are
00:14 - continuing with s 3 but this time we are
00:17 - going to perform basic operations on
00:21 - this free bucket from the lambda so we
00:24 - are going to create a bucket from the
00:26 - server list channel then we are going to
00:28 - give permissions to our lambda to
00:30 - perform operations in that bucket then
00:33 - we are going to create a new file if
00:36 - there is known or and get it we are
00:40 - going to perform some operations on the
00:41 - file and then we are going to save it
00:44 - back and by the end you will get back a
00:48 - sign or L and this is the public or L
00:51 - sign with I am permissions so you can
00:55 - share private files in the open Internet
00:58 - securely so I will show you how to do
01:02 - everything step-by-step and we will be
01:04 - using the AWS SDK for node as we are
01:08 - we're using for dynamo for other things
01:11 - as well so let's go to the code so let's
01:14 - get start as always by creating a new
01:16 - directory where we are going to put our
01:18 - project I will call it several s as free
01:21 - operations you can put any name you want
01:23 - and I will get into that directory I
01:25 - will create a node project and p.m. in
01:29 - it - yes and we then will create a
01:33 - server less project using the template
01:36 - from AWS and node after everything is
01:39 - done when we get into our project that
01:42 - we just created with the free files with
01:45 - package.json 100 Jas and several s you
01:47 - know as always the first thing we need
01:49 - to do is to go to the several SML and
01:51 - change the name of the solace project
01:55 - now I will set the region to Ireland you
01:59 - can put any reason you like but I like
02:00 - airline is closed and then I will pick
02:03 - my profile we got her many and I will
02:05 - just put default remove some of the
02:07 - comments
02:08 - the next thing I want to do is I want to
02:10 - modify them default lambda and change
02:15 - the name to a pen text and then add an
02:17 - HTTP event there will be a put to a path
02:22 - called a paint pen text so whenever we
02:27 - call this endpoint and we passed some
02:31 - text then these text will get appended
02:34 - to file and we can get the file or a
02:39 - public URL back so now I will create a
02:43 - bucket and to create a bucket you just
02:47 - need to use the cloud formation template
02:49 - to put something like these in the
02:52 - server Lezama in the resources property
02:55 - you just put as free operations bucket
02:58 - that's the name of the resource in the
03:00 - in the llam√≥ and then you put the bucket
03:03 - name and I will put several SS free
03:06 - operations bucket you can put any name
03:08 - you want if you pick this name this will
03:10 - be taken by me because name of the
03:12 - buckets are global in all AWS this will
03:15 - create a private bucket for your account
03:18 - with all the default properties if you
03:19 - want to have more detail in your
03:21 - properties you can add whatever you want
03:23 - in this template and it will create a
03:25 - bucket for you the next thing we want to
03:27 - do is we want to give permissions so
03:30 - lambda to write in this bucket and to
03:33 - get the items in this bucket and to do
03:36 - that I will just add permissions in the
03:40 - I am roll off the server less yeah Mel I
03:43 - will add these free actions that this
03:46 - lambda can perform to list the bucket to
03:48 - get the object to put the object and
03:50 - into the resource packet that we just
03:53 - created if I was doing this in
03:54 - production I will have this name as an
03:57 - environmental variable but I think for
04:00 - now I don't want to add that complexity
04:02 - to this code but if you are interested
04:05 - on learning a little bit more about
04:07 - environmental variables just let me know
04:09 - in the comments and I can make a whole
04:10 - video out of them now we are going to
04:12 - our handle Cheers our several HTML is
04:15 - ready and I'm going to change the name
04:17 - of the lambda to from hello to append
04:20 - text and there
04:21 - we are going to create a new file that
04:24 - is the one that will be performing all
04:26 - the operations in the industry
04:29 - I just put manage file you can put any
04:31 - name something better I sure they're
04:33 - better words for this it's just very bad
04:35 - at naming stuff takes me hours so I just
04:38 - pick any name and I will put this manage
04:40 - file and I will create it and in there
04:44 - we will put all the operations that we
04:46 - want to do into our s free to get
04:50 - started we need to require in our file
04:53 - AWS and s free module and then I will
04:56 - create two two constants that will be
04:59 - the bucket name and the object the file
05:02 - name this see Sara will be using if I
05:06 - will be doing it production I will be
05:08 - using environmental variables for now I
05:10 - just have it here and then we will have
05:12 - one main method that it will be called
05:16 - append text and in that method we can we
05:19 - want to do these things first we want to
05:22 - get the file and then we want to append
05:26 - some text to it file so it will be a
05:28 - basic txt file plain text when the pen
05:32 - time textured file in the new line for
05:35 - example and I want to say the file again
05:38 - into the the bucket and then we want to
05:41 - get oral the public URL for this this
05:44 - file so we will do this a chain of
05:48 - promises so we will have four promises
05:51 - chained together that will be performing
05:53 - different things the first thing we want
05:56 - to do is to get an object to do that we
05:58 - will be using this function called get
06:01 - s3 object and the only thing that this
06:03 - is doing is calling the AWS SDK get
06:07 - object with the bucket there is a
06:10 - constant and Hakeem and I just put the
06:13 - response condom type it's a plain text
06:15 - but that's not really needed and I'm
06:19 - making a promise of this so this is
06:20 - returning a promise the next thing we
06:23 - want to do is we want to you want to
06:26 - append some text to that to that file
06:30 - so this get as free object will be
06:33 - returning buffer
06:36 - and this buffer we can then pass to this
06:42 - function append text and we will first
06:47 - have no no information in there so that
06:49 - this buffer will be undefined it will be
06:52 - not found and then we just return the
06:55 - text that we want to append and then if
06:58 - there is something in the buffer we just
07:01 - convert it to string and if it's encoded
07:05 - with ASCII this will be we just append
07:08 - in a new line but text so this is the
07:11 - way to confer to transform a buffer to a
07:14 - string this will just do what we need to
07:16 - do if you want to do more complex
07:18 - operations for example if you are
07:20 - working with images you can do exactly
07:22 - the same get object and maybe the
07:24 - different content type and then here you
07:26 - can do it like resizing an image or
07:29 - whatever or if you are doing something
07:31 - more complex with text or it will be a
07:33 - shayzon this is the function that can be
07:36 - creative as this is a demo I'm just
07:38 - doing something super simple the next
07:40 - thing we want to do is we want to save
07:42 - that file into the bucket again so that
07:46 - will save using the s3 put object
07:51 - function will say the body into the
07:53 - bucket with the content I'm plain text
07:55 - the key will be the exactly same and the
07:58 - body is the one that we got from the
08:00 - append text and the last thing we want
08:02 - to do is to get the sign Aurel this is
08:05 - the public URL for that file sign with
08:07 - your with proper keys so this will
08:11 - expire in time so you get earn well that
08:15 - you can share with other people now you
08:17 - go back to our s3 object so so in the
08:21 - beginning we'll have an empty fold an
08:23 - empty bucket and there will be no file
08:26 - so basically if we try to get this this
08:28 - file we will see that there will be an
08:31 - error so what if there is the file is
08:34 - not there so then we need to handle this
08:35 - error will be only happening once but as
08:39 - we are creating everything from from the
08:42 - code we need to handle that case so here
08:45 - if there is an error like the file not
08:47 - found for example we
08:49 - just can't create the fire layer with
08:51 - nothing on it so then when the next step
08:54 - comes we can append text to it and
08:57 - everything is nice so now we construct
09:00 - the chain of promises that we need this
09:04 - is exactly the same where I was in the
09:06 - comment first we get the object then we
09:08 - append the text then we save the object
09:12 - back and then we get the sign over and
09:15 - that's what we will be returning to the
09:18 - handler Jia's one thing you might be
09:20 - interested in knowing what is inside the
09:22 - AWS SDK in that's free so just go to the
09:26 - documentation and take a look at it it's
09:28 - very complete you can find everything on
09:30 - it and just showing you a bit here but
09:33 - you'll find all these operations and
09:35 - there's a lot of different things you
09:37 - can do so I encourage you to take a look
09:39 - at it and learn how it works because
09:40 - it's very very convenient and leave you
09:43 - the link in the description box so you
09:46 - can find it also the code will be in the
09:49 - description box as always so you can go
09:51 - and check it from github so now we have
09:52 - our manage file done if and save and we
09:57 - go back to our handler tears then I can
09:59 - call that before returning the response
10:01 - so we only send a response when there
10:04 - append text is completed and we can
10:07 - remove a little bit what is in the body
10:09 - to just return the result that is the
10:13 - sign Errol and now we format it a bit we
10:17 - have the missing brackets the last thing
10:19 - is to grab the text that we want to
10:23 - append that I will put it in the query
10:25 - parameters you can put it anywhere else
10:28 - but I like it from there so I will just
10:31 - deploy and we can try it on the postman
10:34 - and see how it works I will speed this
10:36 - up for you because the deployment takes
10:38 - a little while and I don't want you to
10:40 - wait so now this is deployed we just
10:43 - grab the URL that we get from the
10:45 - endpoint and we put copy paste it in
10:49 - postman and we can add the text at the
10:52 - end of a query string parameters I will
10:54 - put Ola and then I get oral bug I just
10:58 - click there and I can request that file
11:00 - and we can say hola
11:02 - and then if I go on food marzia get the
11:08 - same moral back and then I can see what
11:12 - is inside although Mars here and I gave
11:15 - food full bar and if you can put as many
11:18 - things as you and it will just return
11:20 - always them they were up so that's very
11:23 - simple if you go to your AWS account you
11:26 - will see also the bucket is created the
11:28 - file is created you can check it out
11:30 - from there as well this was the video
11:31 - for today I hope you enjoyed it if you
11:33 - did give a big thumbs up
