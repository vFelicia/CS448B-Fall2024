00:00 - hello world in today's video i want to
00:03 - do a very basic video on how to set up
00:05 - your computer to get started with
00:08 - serverless framework so what i'm going
00:09 - to do in this video is first i'm going
00:11 - to show you which formula i'm using then
00:13 - i will be installing some packages that
00:15 - you need in order to install serverless
00:19 - and also i will install atom that is my
00:21 - default text editor this is one of the
00:23 - videos that you will want to watch if
00:25 - you are starting with summerless also if
00:27 - you want to get started and you don't
00:29 - know how to configure your aws account
00:31 - and how to create it go and check the
00:33 - link i'll leave you in the card and also
00:34 - in the description box below these two
00:37 - videos together we left your environment
00:39 - ready to get started you will have a
00:41 - working serverless framework and working
00:44 - aws account so now let's go to the
00:46 - computer screen and let's get this
00:48 - rolling so now i'm in the computer and
00:51 - the first thing i want to do is to
00:53 - install the terminal i like to use
00:54 - because in mac i don't like the mac
00:56 - terminal so we'll install this item too
00:59 - and
01:01 - for that i'm going to the web page where
01:02 - item is and i'm gonna just download it
01:05 - and then i run the installation process
01:07 - as any other mac package if you want to
01:09 - see how i configure my item because i
01:12 - don't use the default configuration
01:14 - let me know and i can make a video about
01:16 - that is pretty simple now when my ad
01:18 - term is config it's downloaded and
01:20 - installed i'm going in download atom
01:22 - because atom is a cool text editor that
01:25 - i like to use i will download it and
01:27 - when it's ready i will also install it
01:29 - and get it ready after atom and the
01:31 - terminal are installed then i will go
01:34 - and
01:35 - install
01:37 - homebrew that is a package manager for
01:39 - mac and with that i will install node
01:42 - so i just follow the instructions in the
01:44 - web page
01:45 - and i continue everything that it says
01:48 - there and it installs homebrew
01:50 - and with that i can then install
01:52 - different packages that are needed in
01:55 - order to install serverless or any other
01:57 - development environment so i like to use
02:00 - homebrew
02:01 - you can also get node from other places
02:04 - but this is the way i like it
02:06 - so after the homebrew finish updating
02:09 - and getting configured then i will
02:11 - install node using it it takes a while
02:15 - so i will speed this up for you because
02:17 - it doesn't make sense for you to watch
02:19 - the whole installation of my different
02:21 - packages that homebrew needs after it's
02:24 - done then we can go and install
02:27 - node we just type brew install node and
02:29 - as easy as that node comes and it's
02:32 - installed
02:33 - brew works for a lot of different
02:35 - libraries that you might need so you
02:37 - will enjoy using it for
02:39 - for other things as well and this will
02:41 - download the latest version of node into
02:44 - my computer after it's done
02:47 - then we are ready to install serverless
02:48 - serverless is a node library so we're
02:51 - going to install it as a global
02:54 - package in our computer so we just do
02:57 - npm install minus g serverless and we
03:00 - download serverless package in our
03:02 - computer as a global nori that we can
03:05 - use from anywhere when that's done then
03:07 - we are going to configure our
03:10 - credentials our aws credentials in the
03:12 - serverless package that we just
03:14 - downloaded and for that you need to have
03:15 - an aws account if you don't have one and
03:18 - you don't know how to do it just follow
03:20 - the instructions that i leave in the
03:21 - card or in the comment box below so we
03:24 - follow the instructions that are in the
03:26 - in the serverless page that is to set up
03:28 - your provider credentials and for that
03:31 - there is a lot of information that you
03:33 - can follow or we just can do one magic
03:36 - line and leave you all these links in
03:39 - the description box so you can find them
03:41 - but it's as simple as that that is the
03:43 - line that we want to use to configure
03:45 - our credentials or less config
03:46 - credentials than the provider and the
03:48 - secret to find the
03:50 - credentials you need to go to your aws
03:53 - account that you created go to i am
03:56 - and then go to
03:58 - your user security credentials and you
04:02 - can create a new access key so you
04:04 - follow the video that i
04:05 - recommended in the card you may have
04:08 - already the csv file downloaded so you
04:11 - can just open that and you don't need to
04:12 - do this step when you open that file you
04:15 - will see that there is a
04:17 - an api key and a secret so you just need
04:20 - to put that in the
04:22 - line and in this case i will just do
04:24 - serverlessconfig credentials providers
04:27 - and that's all then if you open your
04:29 - file the aws credentials then you will
04:31 - see that the credential is configured
04:33 - there then we can verify that everything
04:35 - is configured properly so we just can
04:37 - create a new serverless project and we
04:40 - just do that sls create as always
04:42 - template aws node.js and then the name
04:45 - of the project and it will be my first
04:47 - sls project and
04:49 - we can just open that in atom and we are
04:52 - going to configure an api gateway so we
04:55 - can test this so i will put an api
04:57 - gateway here this is not a video about
05:00 - how to make serverless
05:02 - projects but i was just to show you that
05:04 - you can just deploy this after
05:07 - to verify that everything is properly
05:09 - configured so i'm just making a very
05:11 - simple api gateway and
05:13 - then we can deploy if everything deploy
05:17 - then everything is properly configured
05:19 - and we can go to our aws account and
05:21 - check that we have the lambda and we
05:23 - have the api gateway and we can also
05:26 - run that url that api gateway is giving
05:29 - us to make sure that there is something
05:32 - really in return so i will speed up the
05:34 - deployment and we will go just to the
05:36 - end when we get the service information
05:38 - we just copy paste that url and we see
05:41 - that there is something coming back if
05:43 - you want to remove the service we just
05:44 - do sls remove and it will remove
05:46 - everything from the aws account so our
05:50 - aws account will be clean
05:52 - you don't need to do this this is just
05:54 - because i want to show you how to clean
05:56 - your environment after running some
05:58 - tests
05:59 - this was the video for today i hope you
06:01 - like it if you did give a big thumbs up
