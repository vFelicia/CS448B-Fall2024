00:00 - Hi, my name is Chris Gagne and I'm an Agile Coach.
00:03 - Today, I'll talk about the working agreement. The working agreement is a documented set of ground rules
00:09 - that the team creates and follows in  order to improve their productivity and happiness.
00:15 - Think of some of the things that slow your team down.
00:17 - For example, some teams find that their meetings are more productive when everyone puts away their phones and laptops
00:23 - unless they need them for the meeting. Other teams find that having individuals come too late to their stand up limits their usefulness.
00:30 - The best way to create a working agreement is to use a little bit of reverse psychology.
00:35 - Get together as a team and brainstorm all the ways that your team can fail.
00:40 - Then prioritize the five most significant risks to your team based on their likelihood of occurring and the severity of their impact.
00:48 - Then come up with a specific rule that would prevent that from happening.
00:54 - So, for instance, perhaps the team agrees that having people working on their laptops during the meeting is a big risk to their productivity.
01:00 - They then create a rule that says the only person would should have their laptop open
01:05 - is the person presenting their screen to the rest of the team.
01:08 - All other electronics should be put away.
01:11 - If there's a production issue, the person working on the issue should leave the room, so as not to distract everyone else.
01:17 - See if you can come up with about five to seven rules to help with the top five risks you've identified,
01:23 - then post this in a conspicuous location.
01:26 - If you're co-located, write each role on a sticky note and paste it on the wall near your desks. If you're distributed,
01:33 - create a page in your wiki or a similar space.
01:36 - The whole team is responsible for holding each other accountable and following the working agreement.
01:42 - Be polite and ask each other to follow the rules that you agree to.
01:46 - Escalate only as a last resort.
01:49 - Review your working agreement regularly, at least once every sprint at the retrospective.
01:55 - The team can add or remove items to the working agreement at any time, so long as there is general consensus.
02:02 - If your team creates and uses a working agreement diligently, you will soon find that your team is happier and more productive.
02:11 - Best of luck!
