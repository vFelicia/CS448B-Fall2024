00:00 - well good morning
00:03 - i last spoke at this conference a couple
00:06 - of years ago and and talked about iot
00:09 - uh and today i'm excited to be back to
00:11 - talk about sort of the continuing
00:13 - evolution or
00:14 - revolution of the overall end-to-end
00:17 - architecture and as jim said the
00:19 - importance of the edge
00:23 - you know and
00:24 - we've talked about this coming flood of
00:26 - devices
00:28 - you know 50 billion devices connecting
00:31 - driving traffic you know and the number
00:33 - of devices is an amazing thing
00:36 - but even more than that
00:38 - it's not the devices so much it's the
00:40 - amount of data
00:41 - that is just growing exponentially
00:45 - you know and i think we've kind of
00:47 - thought about the internet up until this
00:50 - point
00:51 - as being sort of person driven traffic
00:54 - i'm uploading videos i'm watching videos
00:56 - i'm using facebook or twitter or surfing
00:58 - the web or whatever
01:00 - and that traffic is continuing to grow
01:03 - you know we're expecting to see
01:05 - a gigabyte and a half of traffic per day
01:07 - per person by 2020 which is a lot
01:11 - but that is going to be completely
01:13 - dwarfed by the data generated by devices
01:17 - and you know a few examples of that you
01:20 - look at a connected airplane
01:22 - five terabytes of data per day generated
01:25 - by that aircraft every single aircraft a
01:28 - smart hospital
01:29 - three terabytes of data per day
01:32 - a connected factory three petabytes of
01:35 - data per day you know imagine a factory
01:37 - that's got thousands of connected
01:39 - devices inside of it and they're all
01:40 - generating data and you're using that to
01:42 - improve your processes
01:44 - a self-driving car you know something
01:46 - that's probably been talked about more
01:48 - than these other use cases
01:50 - generating four terabytes of data per
01:52 - day per car so just an absolute
01:55 - explosion in the amount of data
01:57 - that's going to be generated and
01:59 - obviously
02:00 - with that amount of data being generated
02:02 - you can't just send all that data to the
02:04 - cloud and do analytics on it there and
02:06 - i'll talk about you know there's a
02:07 - variety of reasons for that beyond the
02:09 - fact that no matter how fast your
02:11 - network is you just simply can't
02:12 - transport that much data you know in
02:14 - that time frame so this is going to
02:16 - drive change in
02:18 - some of the technologies that we're all
02:20 - working on you know and as obviously i
02:23 - don't need to tell you open source is
02:25 - the foundation of
02:27 - the end-to-end network that we have
02:29 - today from the devices to the network to
02:31 - the cloud
02:32 - and that's going to continue to be true
02:35 - we've got some great technology building
02:37 - blocks
02:38 - already but there's new use cases and
02:41 - new requirements that are coming and
02:43 - things that we all need to work on to
02:45 - enable this evolution to the edge and
02:49 - i'll talk about a few examples of that
02:50 - and some of the things we're working on
02:52 - and obviously looking forward to all of
02:54 - your collaboration as we work to build
02:56 - this new set of open source technologies
02:59 - for this world to come
03:03 - so cloud computing up until now you know
03:05 - as you're all familiar with
03:07 - has mainly been focused around
03:09 - you know we generate data with devices
03:11 - my mobile device
03:13 - we send that into the cloud where it's
03:15 - stored and then we use compute cycles to
03:18 - do analytics and extract value you know
03:20 - lots of examples of this this is the
03:22 - world that we're all very very familiar
03:24 - with
03:25 - and as we look forward
03:27 - we're going to see that sort of
03:29 - storage computation and analytics
03:32 - capability extend out it's going to
03:35 - extend out to the edge and to the things
03:38 - themselves you know if you think back to
03:40 - those examples i gave of where this data
03:42 - is being generated think of the the
03:45 - autonomous car as a great example
03:47 - that's going to start to look like sort
03:49 - of a mini data center mini cloud on
03:51 - wheels it's going to have
03:53 - all of those capabilities to store and
03:55 - do computation and analytics locally
03:58 - as well as being connected to the cloud
04:00 - to do other
04:01 - computation and analytics you know if
04:04 - you're if you're in a car and you've got
04:06 - cameras and radar and lidar and you're
04:08 - gathering all that data you need to make
04:10 - real-time decisions on how to steer the
04:12 - car
04:12 - and you can't send that data up to the
04:14 - cloud and wait for an answer back on
04:16 - which way to turn
04:17 - that's just not going to work right the
04:18 - latency requirement is way too tight to
04:20 - ever do that and yet of course you're
04:22 - going to be using lots of cloud services
04:24 - as well
04:26 - so you'll have that sort of rolling data
04:28 - center device that's kind of a combined
04:30 - edge device doing a bunch of computation
04:33 - that architecturally kind of looks like
04:35 - a data center and you're going to need a
04:36 - lot of those same capabilities but at a
04:38 - different scale
04:40 - you know if you think about the
04:41 - connected factory or the connected
04:43 - hospital
04:44 - you're going to have a whole collection
04:46 - of devices that live inside of those
04:48 - environments
04:49 - that maybe aren't capable of doing a
04:51 - bunch of compute themselves but you'll
04:54 - see them connected to local edge devices
04:56 - that are going to do some local
04:57 - analytics
04:58 - maybe you don't want to send
05:00 - all of the patient data into the cloud
05:02 - because of privacy concerns you're going
05:04 - to do some analytics on that locally and
05:06 - then some of that data will go to the
05:08 - cloud so we're evolving to this
05:10 - architecture where you've got
05:12 - storage compute and analytics
05:13 - distributed across the end to end
05:15 - network and that's going to drive a need
05:17 - for some new capabilities and new
05:18 - technologies
05:22 - and why is this coming now you know i
05:24 - think we've talked about some of those
05:25 - reasons
05:26 - as these new use cases evolve the
05:29 - autonomous car the connected plane
05:32 - you've got this need for speed and and
05:34 - latency and locality of compute that's
05:37 - going to drive you to do some of these
05:39 - functions at the edge
05:41 - security and privacy you know maybe i
05:43 - don't want to send all of my data
05:46 - into the cloud because there's privacy
05:48 - and security concerns i want to be
05:50 - careful and and thoughtful about what do
05:52 - i compute locally what do i share out
05:53 - into the cloud
05:55 - uh scalability you know with the
05:57 - incredible explosion of data that's
06:00 - being generated you just simply can't
06:03 - transport all of that data into a
06:04 - central place you've got to be able to
06:06 - spread that computation and analytics
06:08 - throughout the entire end-to-end network
06:10 - you know which is also related to cost
06:12 - you know the network bandwidth even with
06:14 - 5g is going to continue to be
06:17 - a precious resource and so we need to
06:19 - use it carefully and balance what we
06:21 - compute locally versus what we send over
06:23 - the network so we're starting to see
06:24 - this happen you know this is already
06:26 - starting to come to be but over the next
06:28 - five years this is going to become more
06:30 - and more of a requirement more and more
06:32 - common you simply won't be able to
06:34 - deliver
06:35 - these new usages unless we're able to
06:38 - create this world of an end-to-end
06:40 - spectrum of compute and analytics and
06:42 - storage of data
06:46 - so what kind of technologies do we need
06:48 - to do this
06:50 - and we have a number of them already you
06:52 - know containerization and orchestration
06:55 - ai and machine learning we're using all
06:57 - of those already and in those cases this
07:00 - is more of an adaptation you know we've
07:02 - got
07:03 - great set of building blocks open source
07:05 - technologies
07:06 - but these are different use cases
07:08 - different scale different requirements
07:10 - so we're going to need to do some
07:11 - adaptation in these areas
07:13 - 5g networking is going to be an
07:16 - essential part of this if you think
07:17 - about autonomous vehicles and how they
07:19 - communicate to the network and with each
07:21 - other
07:22 - 5g is going to play a very big role in
07:24 - that and as you heard from arpit there's
07:25 - a bunch of open source technologies in
07:27 - the software defined networking space
07:30 - that are essential you could never build
07:31 - out the 5g network using proprietary
07:34 - hardware and software it's way too
07:36 - expensive and too slow so open source is
07:38 - going to play a key role there
07:40 - functional safety is another i think
07:42 - really interesting space you know we at
07:44 - intel have been working a lot in and
07:46 - around the autonomous vehicle
07:49 - and we're seeing this really interesting
07:51 - transformation you know as the software
07:54 - workloads inside of the car
07:56 - become orders of magnitude more complex
07:59 - you know traditionally the function only
08:01 - safe systems in a car you know think
08:03 - about the the software that's running
08:05 - your your instrument panel your
08:06 - speedometer and tachometer for example
08:08 - which is has to be safety certified
08:10 - those have traditionally been
08:11 - purpose-built real-time operating
08:13 - systems really small footprints simple
08:16 - but the next generation of cars the
08:18 - software complexity is so much bigger
08:21 - and the people building those systems
08:22 - would love to use a fully featured fully
08:25 - capable operating system like linux
08:27 - but linux is not safety certified or
08:30 - certifiable today
08:32 - and i think that's a big challenge for
08:34 - all of us and we've started to work on
08:36 - this
08:37 - how do we make
08:38 - and create an ecosystem around linux
08:40 - where linux can actually be safety
08:41 - certified and deliver all of the value
08:44 - that we built in linux and the kernel
08:46 - and the core libraries into an ecosystem
08:48 - that's really eager to have that
08:50 - capability but can't use it today i
08:52 - think this is going to take years for us
08:54 - to actually turn into a reality we're at
08:56 - the very beginning of that
08:58 - time sensitive networking again if
09:00 - you're moving real-time data around a
09:02 - vehicle for example you need to be able
09:04 - to do that with latency guarantees and
09:06 - bandwidth guarantees and then finally
09:08 - how do we get all of these devices on
09:10 - board i'll talk a little bit more about
09:12 - those as well
09:14 - so let me click in and just talk about a
09:16 - few things that we're working on
09:18 - related to this space so containers
09:21 - we've been doing some work on
09:24 - containers for the last
09:26 - couple of years and particularly looking
09:28 - at the security aspects of containers
09:31 - so you know linux containers you're
09:33 - running your containers on top of a
09:34 - common kernel which gives you great
09:37 - scalability very lightweight
09:39 - but if that kernel is compromised the
09:41 - security of all of those containers is
09:43 - at risk
09:44 - so obviously we've had virtual machines
09:46 - forever for more than 15 years
09:49 - and we've built inside of the intel
09:51 - platform hardware capabilities to help
09:53 - make those virtual machines secure
09:56 - so we had a couple of engineers aryan
09:58 - vandeven and a couple other folks at
09:59 - intel that looked at you know why can't
10:01 - i apply this hardware capability against
10:04 - containers and that essentially is what
10:06 - clear containers is
10:08 - you know so it's a container
10:10 - that uses the underlying virtualization
10:12 - hardware to deliver security that's very
10:15 - similar to a virtual machine but it's as
10:17 - lightweight and fast as a container
10:20 - it's hosted at clearlinux.org it's an
10:22 - open source project
10:24 - and we'd actually have a demo of it out
10:25 - in the in the demo area if you want to
10:26 - see it in action in terms of how it can
10:28 - fort
10:29 - some of the kernel exploits that could
10:31 - be used to attack containers so a really
10:34 - cool example of how do i make a
10:35 - container more secure and take advantage
10:38 - of some of the underlying hardware
10:39 - capabilities
10:42 - orchestration we've got orchestration
10:44 - solutions for the cloud today we've been
10:46 - working on building a very lightweight
10:48 - orchestrator it's called chow cloud
10:50 - integrated advanced orchestrator
10:53 - we we did it initially and did some
10:55 - trials within openstack to show how we
10:57 - could scale up to very large numbers of
10:59 - nodes in a very fast time frame but
11:02 - we're really focusing this on the edge
11:03 - use case now so how do i create an
11:05 - orchestrator that's really well suited
11:07 - for
11:08 - this very lightweight kind of small
11:10 - footprint
11:11 - context rather than a large data center
11:14 - so another thing that we're working on
11:15 - developing kind of looking forward at
11:16 - the edge use case also hosted on
11:18 - clearlinux.org
11:21 - ai and machine learning we've got some
11:23 - great open source frameworks already and
11:25 - our work has been mainly to plumb our
11:27 - hardware acceleration into those
11:28 - frameworks so if you're running
11:31 - tensorflow or cafe or whatever your
11:33 - favorite framework is you can take
11:35 - advantage of the underlying hardware
11:36 - acceleration whether that's on a xeon or
11:39 - an fpga or a purpose-built accelerator
11:41 - we're going to continue to do that i
11:43 - think what's going to happen kind of
11:45 - uniquely at the edge is you're going to
11:47 - see these frameworks certainly running
11:48 - at the edge to do inference but also
11:51 - combined inference and training as you
11:53 - start to look at how do i do more
11:55 - real-time adaptation of my neural
11:57 - network at the edge or maybe i have data
11:59 - in my training set that i don't want to
12:01 - expose because it's
12:02 - there's privacy or security concerns so
12:04 - you're going to start to see these
12:05 - workloads running more and more at the
12:07 - edge and also together both the training
12:09 - part creating the model and the
12:11 - inference part where you're using the
12:12 - model and we're going to continue to
12:14 - work on making sure that these
12:15 - frameworks run great on top of our our
12:17 - hardware platforms
12:20 - 5g we talked about
12:22 - coming in terms of driving a great
12:23 - amount of bandwidth the other thing
12:25 - that's really unique about 5g is it's
12:27 - not only continuing to grow the mobile
12:29 - bandwidth but it's also providing some
12:31 - really unique new capabilities for
12:34 - both massive machine-to-machine
12:36 - communication and also ultra ultra
12:38 - reliable low latency communication so
12:41 - you can imagine if you have a bunch of
12:42 - autonomous vehicles driving down the
12:43 - road they can actually use this ultra
12:45 - reliable low latency
12:47 - flavor of 5g to talk with each other and
12:49 - to do coordinated actions so we think
12:52 - this is really exciting you know we're
12:53 - obviously
12:54 - very actively involved in driving the
12:56 - overall 5g standardization but also
12:58 - working on a bunch of the open source
13:01 - software-defined networking technologies
13:03 - that are going to be needed to build
13:04 - these networks going forward
13:07 - time sensitive networking again inside
13:09 - of an autonomous vehicle if you're
13:11 - moving sensor data around in real time
13:14 - just regular old ethernet isn't good
13:15 - enough you need to have latency
13:17 - guarantees you need to have bandwidth
13:19 - reservation so you're absolutely certain
13:21 - that your critical data is delivered
13:23 - where you need it to go
13:25 - with the right timeliness so there's
13:27 - been standards work going on here for a
13:29 - while in the avenue group avnu and we
13:32 - are working in the open avenue project
13:34 - which is building out all of the linux
13:36 - infrastructure that's required to fully
13:38 - support time-sensitive networking in a
13:41 - linux platform
13:44 - and then finally device onboarding you
13:46 - know back to this world of 50 billion
13:49 - connected devices one of the biggest
13:52 - challenges is how do i get these devices
13:53 - onto the network in a secure fashion how
13:56 - do i get them on the network
13:57 - transparently and with zero touch
14:00 - so we've been working on some
14:02 - new capabilities that use a hardware
14:04 - chain of trust where you can ship out a
14:06 - device turn it on have it
14:09 - be onboarded into the network securely
14:11 - and transparently without any
14:12 - interaction
14:14 - in a way that doesn't cause security
14:16 - vulnerabilities you know a lot of times
14:18 - today this is done
14:19 - using it using a default password maybe
14:21 - or it requires some human interaction
14:24 - you know if you're going to onboard 50
14:25 - billion devices there can't be any
14:27 - humans involved so we've been working on
14:29 - integrating this with for example the
14:31 - open connectivity foundation and the
14:33 - iotivity project so kind of an ongoing
14:35 - project to solve one of the really hard
14:37 - problems in deploying all of these edge
14:40 - devices securely across the network
14:44 - so there's a lot of work going on
14:45 - already in this end-to-end space and
14:48 - we're involved in driving you know some
14:49 - of the projects that i mentioned but
14:51 - also working in many many of the open
14:53 - source projects as we work to evolve the
14:56 - technology to support what we think is
14:58 - going to be one of the really big
15:00 - next use cases around edge computing and
15:03 - i'm really excited to collaborate with
15:04 - all of you to make that a reality
15:08 - so we've got as i mentioned in the booth
15:10 - just outside the door we've got a demo
15:12 - of the clear containers and some other
15:13 - cool demos that show some of this
15:16 - want to make sure you're aware there's a
15:17 - diversity and inclusion lunch panel on
15:19 - thursday a really important subject so i
15:22 - hope you can all attend that on thursday
15:23 - afternoon
15:24 - and with that thank you all very much
15:27 - [Applause]
