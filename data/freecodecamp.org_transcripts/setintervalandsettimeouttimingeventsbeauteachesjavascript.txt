00:00 - there are two timing events that are
00:02 - part of the window object that both
00:04 - allow execution of code at specific time
00:07 - time intervals
00:08 - the two timing events are set timeout
00:11 - and set interval
00:12 - for set timeout you pass in a function
00:15 - in milliseconds and the program will
00:17 - wait the specified number of
00:18 - milliseconds and execute the function
00:20 - let's see some code
00:22 - okay here's the set timeout function it
00:24 - could be
00:25 - window.settimeout but the window is
00:27 - implied you pass in the name of the
00:29 - function which is by
00:31 - and then here's the function down here
00:33 - you also pass in the milliseconds here
00:36 - so
00:37 - after
00:38 - 3 000 milliseconds which is three
00:40 - seconds it's going to run the function
00:44 - by which this is just going to
00:45 - console.log goodbye but before that it's
00:48 - going to console.log hello
00:50 - so let's run that
00:53 - one
00:54 - two
00:55 - three
00:56 - so you saw it said hello and then
00:58 - goodbye it is possible to stop the
01:01 - function from running after the set
01:03 - timeout is called
01:05 - you must assign the set timeout to a
01:08 - variable so luvvar
01:13 - so we've set that to var timeout id
01:16 - and then we're going to call
01:18 - cleartimeout and pass in the variable
01:26 - so let's try that
01:28 - it's going to say hello but it will
01:30 - never say goodbye because we've cleared
01:32 - the timeout the set interval function
01:35 - is similar you pass in a function in
01:37 - milliseconds but the program will
01:40 - execute the function continuously
01:42 - waiting the specified number of
01:44 - milliseconds between each function here
01:47 - we're creating a timer we're going to
01:49 - set the count to zero
01:51 - and we're going to call set interval
01:53 - pass in the counter function and 1000
01:56 - milliseconds that's one second so every
01:59 - one second it's going to call this
02:01 - counter function where it's going to log
02:04 - count it's also going to increment count
02:07 - one
02:09 - and we're going to set it to an int id
02:12 - up here i already have a button
02:15 - so
02:16 - in the button we have an on click event
02:19 - that says clear interval with an int id
02:23 - the end id is down there we can stop the
02:25 - timer by clicking the stop timer button
02:28 - and it won't go on forever so let's run
02:30 - that and see how that works
02:33 - well you can see it's counting every
02:35 - second but if i click the stop time
02:38 - button
02:39 - it stops so clear interval just stops
02:42 - the function in the set interval from
02:44 - running well that's all for now thanks
02:45 - for watching my name is beau carnes
02:48 - don't forget to subscribe and remember
02:50 - use your code for good
