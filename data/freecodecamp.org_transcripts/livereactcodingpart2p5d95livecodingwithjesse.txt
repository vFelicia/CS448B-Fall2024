00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:07 - and today we're going to be working with
00:10 - react and i'm trying to get this project
00:13 - ready that we've been working on for
00:15 - months and months
00:17 - since the beginning of the year
00:19 - and
00:20 - so i just have a bunch of things on my
00:22 - list
00:23 - that need finished up some of them are
00:25 - just minor changes other ones a little
00:27 - bit bigger we're just going to see how
00:28 - many we can get through today
00:32 - for those of you who are new to the
00:34 - stream
00:35 - this is me doing my
00:37 - daily work as a front-end developer
00:40 - so this is not rehearsed
00:44 - we're gonna make mistakes
00:45 - i don't always know what what i'm gonna
00:47 - do going in like today i'm not exactly
00:49 - sure how much we'll cover
00:51 - i do my best to try to explain things as
00:54 - i go along
00:55 - feel free to ask any questions if you
00:57 - have questions
00:59 - i split things up by pomodoro sessions
01:02 - so we'll do a 25 minute session of code
01:04 - where i won't really look at the live
01:06 - chat that much
01:08 - and then i'll take a five minute break
01:10 - i'll catch up on the chat answer a few
01:11 - questions
01:12 - and then we'll go back and forth between
01:16 - the 25 minutes of code and five minutes
01:18 - of questions uh until i feel like
01:20 - stopping and then i'll finish up with
01:22 - all the questions uh before we end the
01:25 - stream
01:27 - so
01:31 - let me explain very quickly what we're
01:33 - working on
01:35 - and
01:35 - what i hope to accomplish at least in
01:37 - the first pomodoro session
01:40 - so
01:41 - we are working on a react
01:43 - website
01:45 - it will be the main website for a small
01:47 - university
01:48 - that i work for
01:50 - and
01:51 - we are getting data from wordpress
01:55 - and we're pulling it into
01:57 - this react uh website with graphql and a
02:01 - rest api
02:03 - uh what else we doing that's that's good
02:06 - enough for now we're not really going to
02:07 - work with any back end stuff so i don't
02:09 - need to explain everything if you're
02:10 - interested in that you can check out
02:12 - some of the previous shows or ask me and
02:14 - i'll explain it later on but for today
02:17 - uh we're going to be working mainly just
02:19 - on the front end side of things with
02:21 - react some components
02:24 - some styles we are using material
02:27 - material ui
02:28 - it's a library of react components to
02:31 - give your app a
02:33 - material design style
02:36 - i did recently upgrade to the latest
02:38 - version of material ui so it's version
02:40 - three
02:42 - so
02:43 - this is all the the newest stuff
02:46 - and
02:48 - uh yeah let's get started so i'm gonna
02:51 - switch over
02:53 - so y'all can see
02:55 - what's on my screen
02:57 - and i'm gonna make this a bit bigger
03:00 - okay let me know if that font size needs
03:03 - to be larger than that
03:05 - i'll try to
03:08 - shrink down everything
03:12 - as much as possible
03:15 - all right so almost
03:17 - uh everything that you see on my screen
03:19 - is available in the github repo i did
03:22 - make just a few changes that i didn't
03:24 - push to github yet
03:26 - uh and that's simply right here you can
03:28 - see with this blue bar i added in uh
03:31 - some grid containers and
03:34 - a button so that's we're going to start
03:36 - out now we're going to add in a few more
03:37 - buttons make sure they link to the right
03:39 - place
03:41 - and that'll be the the starting point
03:43 - we're in the footer.js component so the
03:46 - link to the github repo is in the
03:47 - description if you'd like to follow
03:48 - along
03:49 - i can also start this ngrok server
03:53 - um let me start my pomodoro session and
03:56 - then i'll start ngrok
03:58 - oh i can't remember i started ngrok
04:00 - let's see if it's in there we go
04:03 - i can never remember the command because
04:04 - i always just have it ready so let's
04:07 - start that up now i'm going to copy and
04:09 - paste this link in the live chat if you
04:12 - click this link or copy and paste it
04:13 - into your browser you'll be able to see
04:15 - the website that we're working on as
04:17 - we're working on it
04:19 - one other big change that has happened
04:21 - since the last time i i streamed was
04:24 - that
04:25 - i tried out google app engine so i had a
04:28 - few phone calls with some
04:29 - representatives from google cloud
04:32 - and
04:35 - they
04:36 - kind of filled me in on some of the
04:37 - options that i had for hosting this and
04:40 - so i decided to
04:42 - try out app engine instead of using now
04:46 - for deployment and hosting i really like
04:48 - it it's very fast it'll consolidate all
04:51 - my billing into one place instead of
04:53 - having
04:54 - multiple companies
04:56 - so i think i'm going to go with that
04:59 - so i haven't switched over
05:01 - the url yet from now to app engine but
05:05 - that will be happening soon
05:08 - so i'll probably do
05:10 - i'll probably
05:12 - do some work with that on a live stream
05:14 - when it gets close to the time to launch
05:16 - which should be pretty soon
05:18 - i had a lot of meetings recently
05:22 - uh with changes to the website so
05:26 - um the launch will happen within the
05:28 - next few weeks
05:30 - unless i have more meetings and
05:31 - something else changes i suppose
05:36 - okay
05:38 - uh let me
05:40 - let me double check okay so that seems
05:42 - like it's working for you all
05:46 - and i want to show you on the for those
05:48 - of you who can't open that link i do
05:50 - want to show you on the screen what this
05:52 - is going to look like
05:53 - so
05:55 - we're working on the footer right now
05:56 - you see i had some lorem ipsum
05:59 - with so it's called bacon ipsum it's
06:01 - laura mipsum
06:03 - uh filler text with uh the names of
06:07 - various meats in there
06:10 - uh so i'm replacing that with this you
06:12 - see i've already put in the address and
06:14 - this is
06:16 - properly formatted
06:18 - right so according to
06:21 - what schema.org says so that that can
06:24 - get picked up by search engines and
06:26 - display properly
06:28 - all right so we've done that and now i
06:30 - just want to put in a few buttons
06:32 - uh to request info and then over here
06:34 - i'm just gonna put a very short list of
06:37 - some other links
06:39 - um
06:40 - probably
06:41 - links to like the privacy policy and
06:43 - things like that you know your standard
06:45 - stuff that most websites have in the
06:47 - footer
06:48 - that's what we're gonna have for now
06:50 - we'll have some different stuff in there
06:52 - after we launch most likely uh we're
06:54 - gonna maybe have a small contact form
06:57 - but for now this is what we're gonna go
06:59 - with for for launch so i need two other
07:01 - buttons it's going to mimic what we have
07:03 - here request info apply and visit
07:06 - and really i'm going to have the same
07:08 - setup here of
07:10 - request info
07:11 - being large and then these two buttons
07:14 - being half the width
07:17 - so we got request info in there it
07:20 - it just the button just has the
07:22 - appearance it's not linked up to
07:23 - anything yet so we'll have to put that
07:25 - in but for now
07:27 - let's just get everything in here
07:29 - and then we can work on the rest of it
07:31 - i'll probably want to
07:34 - center this
07:37 - inside of here
07:38 - otherwise it's going to look
07:41 - a little bit odd so let's get the
07:44 - buttons in there and then we can work on
07:46 - on centering things i also i've been
07:49 - developing things kind of in this view
07:52 - mobile first view
07:53 - so i'm probably going to stick with this
07:56 - although it may be hard to see on the
07:58 - stream so
07:59 - i am going to kind of toggle back and
08:01 - forth just so that i get an idea of how
08:04 - this will look
08:05 - uh on a mobile
08:07 - environment as well
08:09 - so for now i'm i'm going to just zoom in
08:11 - on this section so you all can see it
08:15 - but let's go in here and
08:17 - so we have this
08:18 - grid item
08:21 - in material ui it comes with this grid
08:24 - system these grid components right so
08:27 - we
08:28 - have this grid container
08:31 - for the footer
08:32 - and then within it we're splitting the
08:34 - footer up into three sections on a large
08:37 - screen on a small screen
08:39 - each section takes up the full width
08:41 - right
08:43 - so
08:44 - within that middle section of the three
08:47 - we've put another container and then we
08:50 - have another grid item this first one is
08:51 - going to take up the full width all the
08:53 - time but we're going to make two more
08:55 - that are going to take up the full width
08:57 - on a small screen
08:58 - but on a larger screen it's only going
09:00 - to take up half the width
09:02 - all right that's how we're going to get
09:03 - the buttons so it'll be one button on
09:05 - the top and then
09:07 - two buttons underneath
09:10 - we also want to make sure that we pass
09:12 - in the correct info
09:15 - so
09:15 - this is a
09:17 - component that we've created called this
09:19 - inverted button and that basically just
09:21 - gives us these styles
09:23 - material ui does have a button they
09:25 - didn't when we started this project but
09:27 - they now have a button called an
09:28 - outlined button uh it's a button variant
09:32 - on that
09:33 - the button component
09:34 - i i'm not
09:37 - i kind of like the style better maybe
09:39 - just because i'm used to it because i've
09:40 - been using it so their outline button is
09:42 - a little bit different so i've decided
09:44 - to just stick with our inverted button
09:46 - for now
09:48 - and
09:49 - at some point maybe we'll switch it up
09:51 - but this works for now we've already
09:53 - created this component so it'll be less
09:55 - work to just use this
09:56 - than to try to modify the styles of
10:01 - the
10:02 - material ui button
10:06 - um so let's go to that component just
10:09 - for a second to see what we need to pass
10:11 - in
10:14 - actually we can check here
10:18 - because we have these buttons yep here
10:20 - we are so we can pass in
10:22 - an href
10:24 - a title
10:26 - yep that works let's do that then i'm
10:29 - going to just grab these from here
10:33 - i'm sorry i need to change my uh
10:36 - my playlist here
10:37 - the throwback thursday playlist on
10:39 - spotify is playing me like all these
10:42 - slow jams and
10:44 - i've got nothing against slow jams but
10:47 - they're just not great to code to like i
10:50 - need energy right
10:52 - you know what i'm saying
10:53 - uh so let's
10:56 - let's switch it up
11:00 - okay
11:06 - so let me add these i want to add it
11:08 - here to this button because i'm going to
11:10 - copy and paste all this and
11:12 - the more complete this one is then the
11:14 - less i have to modify everything
11:17 - so
11:18 - i'm going to change this to
11:24 - just include this
11:27 - right because they're they're all going
11:28 - to have different
11:30 - different um values for these so let's
11:33 - just leave it like this for now
11:36 - and
11:39 - we're going to copy the whole grid
11:42 - at some point it might not be a bad idea
11:44 - to pull all this data in
11:47 - uh from
11:48 - from our api
11:50 - from wordpress but for now i'm just
11:52 - trying to get this launched i don't have
11:54 - a problem hardcoding this right now
11:57 - eventually it'd be great to have as much
11:59 - as possible
12:01 - be editable from within our cms
12:05 - but
12:06 - that that me
12:08 - that way if anything needs to change
12:10 - like for the text content we don't
12:12 - actually have to change our code which
12:14 - is a good thing
12:16 - uh that's a good goal to have but not
12:18 - necessary before launch
12:21 - all right so let me change
12:22 - these let me double check and see what
12:25 - we have here okay apply and then visit
12:28 - so
12:30 - this one's gonna say apply
12:32 - oops
12:34 - and this one will say
12:36 - visit
12:40 - and
12:41 - we're going to add in here so that on
12:44 - small screens
12:47 - let's have
12:48 - let's take up 6
12:51 - right so six columns
12:53 - which would be half
12:59 - we'll see how this looks i think a small
13:01 - screen will be a good place to have this
13:03 - break point but if it's too narrow then
13:05 - we can always
13:06 - go up and say that that break will take
13:08 - place at the medium size
13:13 - and
13:15 - i'll leave out the titles and the ahrefs
13:17 - for now because we're just trying to get
13:20 - things
13:21 - uh to look right and that's just a
13:24 - matter of copying and pasting i can
13:25 - always do that later
13:28 - let's see
13:30 - all right that's good let's save that
13:32 - and then check it out two we have okay
13:36 - cool so
13:37 - we now have these buttons
13:40 - definitely need to make some adjustments
13:42 - though this doesn't look good at all
13:45 - right
13:47 - so let me double check how it looks on a
13:49 - small screen too
13:52 - yeah not great it doesn't look good
13:56 - so
13:58 - let's change this a bit
14:03 - and
14:05 - let's see
14:09 - you know what let's go in here
14:12 - first we'll try to make some changes in
14:15 - dev tools
14:18 - this will enable us to change things
14:21 - just a a bit more click quickly than we
14:24 - could
14:26 - with our code and we won't have to keep
14:27 - flipping back and forth between screens
14:30 - so i wanted to double check and make
14:32 - sure that this was set to display flex
14:35 - it is uh which i figured it was
14:39 - and
14:41 - let's see how we can do this so
14:45 - we can go with
14:49 - let's try flex
14:54 - let's see justify content and see what
14:56 - this is going to do for us
14:59 - no um
15:01 - align items
15:08 - okay that's not doing anything either
15:11 - um
15:14 - all right let's try this
15:17 - display flex
15:19 - line items
15:24 - huh there we go
15:27 - okay
15:29 - so
15:30 - usually i have to play with flexbox a
15:31 - little bit i'm still you know i'm not i
15:34 - don't use it enough and i'm not that
15:35 - good with it to just know exactly what i
15:37 - need at first so
15:39 - what we did here was we set this
15:43 - div which our is our container div for
15:45 - this button
15:47 - all right
15:48 - we set this div to be display flex and
15:51 - then we could
15:53 - use the flexbox
15:54 - positioning uh for this so
15:58 - we set justify content to center you see
16:01 - that move the button right into the
16:03 - center
16:04 - okay so
16:06 - let's
16:08 - do something similar with these but what
16:11 - we're going to do is
16:15 - i'm going to say display flex we're
16:17 - going to justify content
16:19 - and for this one we're going to say flex
16:21 - end
16:22 - and for this one
16:27 - oops
16:28 - yeah
16:30 - actually this one works as is we don't
16:32 - need to say anything
16:33 - all right but what we do need to say
16:39 - all right before i get too far ahead of
16:40 - myself let's go back and add these
16:43 - styles in
16:45 - in here so
16:46 - uh what i want to do is
16:58 - let me add in some some styles here so
17:00 - let's say
17:03 - am i actually using white i think i am
17:07 - yeah i am okay
17:09 - i will get rid of it then so let's just
17:11 - say um
17:16 - flex container
17:19 - we're going to create the style called
17:20 - flex container and this is just going to
17:22 - give it a display
17:24 - oops
17:27 - flex
17:29 - i need to put that
17:31 - okay so if you've never done styles like
17:33 - this with react
17:35 - basically these are um
17:38 - very similar to normal css but it's in
17:41 - the form of a javascript object so the
17:44 - syntax is going to look a little
17:45 - different we use camelcase
17:48 - right
17:48 - and then we have to put most of our
17:52 - values here in
17:55 - quotation marks
17:58 - but we can take this then this flex
18:01 - container class
18:02 - and add it onto
18:04 - our grids
18:07 - and i'm going to use my multiple cursors
18:09 - here
18:10 - to say
18:13 - we go class name
18:14 - and we're going to say classes dot flex
18:20 - container
18:24 - and let's save that
18:29 - and
18:31 - we should see
18:32 - let me refresh this to get rid of what
18:34 - we did over here
18:39 - hmm what did i do
18:40 - here okay
18:43 - i don't know why that was so slow
18:45 - but
18:46 - it should work now
18:56 - okay
18:58 - so if we inspect those containers they
19:01 - should all have display flex yep
19:04 - so this display flex on this one on this
19:07 - one and on this one
19:12 - and
19:13 - now
19:14 - we can add our other
19:17 - uh styles in here
19:19 - so what i want to do now is i'm we're
19:22 - gonna have this this class name but also
19:24 - i'm gonna use the style tag this is just
19:26 - gonna demonstrate another way you can do
19:28 - styles in react and basically it's an
19:31 - inline style
19:33 - but we're still gonna use that
19:34 - javascript
19:35 - object uh syntax here
19:38 - so we're going to say style
19:40 - we're going to put double curly brackets
19:42 - so the first curly bracket is
19:44 - means that hey we're going to do some
19:46 - javascript so we're telling
19:49 - react we're about to do some javascript
19:50 - and then that second bracket is
19:53 - object notation right it's going to say
19:55 - this is an object so within that object
19:57 - we're going to have key value pairs just
19:59 - like a normal object right and our our
20:02 - key in this case is going to be
20:07 - justify
20:09 - content
20:11 - and then our value is going to be center
20:16 - i think that's what we need center i'm
20:18 - going to copy and paste this
20:22 - down here
20:26 - to
20:28 - this grid as well
20:31 - and for this one we needed to say flex
20:34 - end
20:35 - okay now this should
20:37 - give us now our
20:40 - alignment that we had
20:42 - before
20:44 - hopefully
20:49 - there we are see so this gives us our
20:51 - alignment
20:52 - okay so
20:54 - normally uh so if i have a
20:58 - style that i want to apply to multiple
21:00 - components it makes sense to put it down
21:03 - here and add it as a class
21:06 - if i have a style that i'm going to use
21:07 - once
21:08 - and it's just one thing then i usually
21:11 - do it in line like this
21:13 - if i were to apply let's say two or
21:15 - three
21:16 - like three or more things to a component
21:19 - even if i'm only going to apply it to
21:20 - one one component or one element i'll
21:23 - probably make it a class as well it can
21:26 - get pretty messy if you start to put a
21:27 - lot of stuff in line like this so
21:31 - for me for the way i do things this
21:33 - makes sense
21:35 - if we end up adding in some other stuff
21:38 - we'll just move it down it's not a big
21:40 - deal
21:41 - it's you know copy and paste
21:44 - so this is how i like to work
21:48 - there's there's not really a consensus
21:50 - on what is the absolute best way to do
21:52 - styles in react right now
21:55 - so
21:56 - i use a variety of ways usually on the
21:58 - same project even within the same
21:59 - component
22:01 - and until there's some consensus about
22:03 - the best way which honestly may never
22:05 - happen i'm just going to keep trying out
22:07 - different ways and doing what works
22:10 - for my projects
22:12 - okay just want to let y'all know if you
22:14 - haven't put anything in the live chat
22:16 - and i haven't read it uh i'm
22:19 - i'm gonna check the live chat here in
22:21 - about six and a half minutes okay so uh
22:25 - just hang in there
22:26 - uh just a few more minutes
22:30 - okay
22:31 - so next step then is uh we don't want
22:33 - this still looks terrible right we don't
22:35 - want this so
22:37 - we need to
22:40 - put some space in here
22:43 - so we need some padding between there
22:45 - let's try 8 pixels
22:47 - and if that's too tight we'll jump we'll
22:49 - bump it up to 16 pixels and just see how
22:51 - that looks after that then we're gonna
22:54 - make it so that these buttons
22:56 - uh align properly uh with this top
23:00 - button so basically like
23:02 - the width of this top button should be
23:05 - the same as the width of both these
23:07 - buttons and the padding in between them
23:10 - all combine
23:11 - if that doesn't make sense right now it
23:13 - will once you see it
23:15 - so again let's just test this out here
23:18 - in dev tools first
23:20 - and make this a bit bigger might be too
23:22 - small
23:23 - um
23:25 - so
23:26 - in dev tools
23:28 - let's take this button here
23:31 - and
23:32 - let's add
23:33 - some let's go margin
23:39 - i'm just gonna add eight pixels in here
23:42 - and
23:44 - then down here
23:47 - let's add
23:54 - 8 pixels
23:56 - and we'll do the same thing for this
23:57 - button
23:59 - and we'll just see how it looks first
24:01 - then we'll adjust
24:06 - okay
24:09 - let's zoom out
24:11 - actually i i like that
24:14 - i like how that looks let's switch it up
24:16 - for a second and see how it looks here
24:19 - it's gonna be weird see so we're gonna
24:21 - have to put in a media query here and
24:23 - switch up how they're aligned but for
24:25 - now
24:28 - that the at least the spacing between
24:30 - them is acceptable
24:34 - okay
24:35 - all right so that looked good so i think
24:37 - if we go with just a standard eight
24:39 - pixels around all of our buttons that'll
24:42 - work and fortunately we already have a
24:46 - class on all our buttons right this
24:48 - inverted button dart class
24:50 - so i'm just going to add to that class
24:54 - a margin of
24:57 - 8 pixels
25:00 - remember
25:01 - our comma
25:03 - when we save that
25:06 - that should work i'm not going to check
25:07 - because it's
25:08 - i'm like 99 sure that'll work
25:11 - okay
25:12 - now
25:15 - we want to make sure that
25:17 - our buttons are all aligned like in
25:19 - terms of a width right
25:24 - so to do that
25:28 - i guess there's some different ways we
25:29 - could do it
25:32 - um let's see what this looks like
25:37 - let's just we'll play around a little
25:38 - bit see what this will look like
25:40 - so let's take this button and um
25:44 - let's just
25:45 - i don't think it's going to look good
25:46 - like this but i just want to try it
25:48 - right so
25:49 - uh let's go with with
25:52 - 100
25:54 - oh that's huge okay too big
25:57 - too big
25:58 - hmm
26:10 - so we could go with a fixed width or a
26:12 - percentage with
26:15 - i guess it'll probably be easier
26:19 - if we go to fix with let's see what we
26:20 - have up here i mean we obviously
26:23 - achieved this up here i just don't
26:24 - remember how we did it
26:26 - um
26:27 - let's see
26:35 - okay so i did go with the fix with
26:40 - all right well let's just try that
26:42 - let's just let's try fix with
26:44 - so
26:49 - we can try with with
26:55 - 200 pixels
26:57 - okay actually that's that's not too bad
27:01 - uh in terms of
27:03 - this working here
27:06 - so if we had 200 pixels as the width
27:08 - here each one of these buttons would
27:10 - need to be
27:11 - 100 pixels but
27:14 - since we have 16 pixels of
27:17 - margin in here we'd have to subtract
27:20 - that so that would be eight off of each
27:23 - button
27:24 - so we want to make each button 92 pixels
27:27 - and that should that should work
27:30 - so
27:32 - let's do this then
27:35 - on our button itself
27:39 - let's go
27:40 - let's make sure i'm on the right button
27:42 - here
27:44 - on our buttons
27:47 - i'm going to do our multiple cursors
27:49 - again to select all of them at once
27:52 - and we're going to do style
27:55 - equals we're going to use our double
27:57 - brackets here
27:59 - and
28:00 - let's say width
28:04 - is going to equal
28:06 - 92
28:08 - pixels
28:10 - so these two are going to stay 92 and
28:12 - for this one
28:13 - i'm going to switch it up and say 200.
28:17 - now when i save that hopefully
28:22 - it works
28:25 - well let's see
28:26 - did it work
28:31 - is that lined up yeah it is lined up
28:34 - cool that worked
28:36 - okay
28:36 - so we have
28:40 - all of our buttons here
28:43 - nice
28:45 - all lined up properly
28:47 - let's check it out for mobile
28:49 - it's going to look bad so this still
28:51 - looks bad so
28:53 - we need to
28:54 - switch it up for mobile which is going
28:57 - to be basically we're just going to work
28:59 - with some media queries here and what is
29:01 - this pixel 2 let's let's drop down
29:03 - i mean the pixel 2 is a pretty wide
29:05 - phone let's go to a very narrow phone
29:09 - because if it works for a very narrow
29:10 - phone we'll know that it'll work for a
29:12 - little bit of a wider phone if we're
29:14 - going to drop down here this is only 320
29:16 - pixels
29:17 - uh and across in width and that's the s
29:21 - the narrowest phone that i know of
29:24 - right so i i don't know at least the
29:27 - last time i checked there was no other
29:29 - viewport that had it it was more narrow
29:31 - than that so if it works here it'll work
29:32 - for everything
29:34 - um so given that
29:37 - we may be able to do
29:41 - really what we could do is is keep
29:45 - the same alignment
29:49 - even on a on a phone
29:51 - that might be the easiest thing to do so
29:53 - that we would actually have that
29:56 - yeah
29:57 - um
29:58 - let's let's try that here
30:01 - my my timer just went off so i'm going
30:04 - to go back to the live chat
30:06 - in just a second
30:07 - but
30:10 - if we get rid of
30:13 - this
30:32 - did i mess that up
30:38 - extra small 12
30:40 - oops
30:42 - yeah that was not what i wanted to do
30:45 - um
30:46 - what i want to do
30:52 - oops that's not gonna work
30:54 - i wanna
30:55 - make this six
30:58 - yeah and then get rid of
31:00 - this
31:01 - okay
31:07 - there we are
31:16 - there we go okay so now we have these
31:19 - buttons here there's still some issues i
31:21 - think with uh spacing between the
31:23 - sections but
31:26 - not bad
31:28 - not sure if i like it centered either
31:30 - but
31:32 - uh i i think it's it's okay for now it's
31:37 - it's decent
31:38 - okay let me
31:39 - put on my
31:41 - my five minute timer now i'm gonna go to
31:44 - the chat get through as many things as i
31:45 - can
31:48 - uh
31:50 - abdul
31:51 - rahman says hi jesse thank you for
31:54 - sharing your live video with us i get my
31:56 - motivation from your videos because
31:57 - you're showing us how to how a developer
32:00 - works and gets into some code issues and
32:03 - mistakes thanks oh you're welcome i'm
32:06 - i'm glad this is uh this is helpful for
32:08 - you and helps um
32:11 - helps motivate you
32:14 - see ahmed says what do i need to learn
32:16 - before starting in react
32:18 - html css javascript
32:21 - so
32:23 - at least the basics of those right the
32:26 - more you know about html css and
32:28 - javascript the easier react is going to
32:30 - be but you certainly don't need to be an
32:32 - expert first
32:35 - uh
32:36 - babashov says hi from
32:39 - azerbaijan
32:40 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing any of that
32:42 - uh but
32:43 - uh how's it going thanks for watching
32:47 - uh mun griffin says thank you i've been
32:50 - watching your videos oh you're welcome
32:52 - thanks for watching
32:55 - uh
32:57 - pose posey says only basic javascript
33:00 - then you can start react.js yeah yeah
33:02 - for sure just learn
33:04 - you know if you want to know the bare
33:05 - minimum to start react is just basics of
33:07 - javascript
33:10 - let's see uh ackee says what's free code
33:13 - camp uh free code camp is a non-profit
33:16 - organization and our goal is to
33:20 - help people learn how to code for free
33:22 - so freecodecam.org has a bunch of
33:25 - lessons
33:27 - you can take to learn how to code online
33:31 - we have this youtube channel with a ton
33:33 - of content we have a medium publication
33:36 - which lots of blogs and tutorials there
33:38 - we have a forum where you can ask
33:40 - questions uh we also have a podcast
33:43 - and
33:44 - there are free code camp meetup groups
33:46 - all over the world so there are a lot of
33:49 - different ways that free code camp is is
33:51 - helping people to learn how to code
33:54 - and
33:55 - actually there's going to be a free code
33:56 - camp hackathon in san francisco at the
33:58 - end of october so uh you could check
34:01 - that out as well if you're in san
34:04 - francisco i think there's going to be an
34:07 - online portion of the hackathon so even
34:08 - if you're not there in san francisco you
34:10 - can still participate so check that out
34:13 - um
34:14 - i don't remember what the link is but if
34:16 - you look it up free code camp hackathon
34:17 - i'm sure it'll come up
34:22 - uh
34:23 - nilesh says do you have the correct
34:25 - folder structure for react
34:27 - i don't i don't really know
34:29 - as far as i know
34:32 - there's not a standard react folder
34:33 - structure maybe i'm wrong about this but
34:35 - it kind of depends on what
34:38 - you use to bootstrap your react
34:40 - application
34:41 - right so if i'm using next js like like
34:44 - i am
34:46 - uh usually we have this uh pages folder
34:50 - and you wouldn't normally have a pages
34:53 - folder if you let's say you use create
34:54 - react app you may have a folder that
34:56 - would say views instead of pages so you
34:58 - may not have it at all so
35:00 - um
35:02 - you know this is the structure that i
35:04 - use
35:05 - if
35:06 - i'm using
35:08 - next js
35:14 - let's see
35:17 - uh ab let's see
35:20 - abby just says thank you for this you're
35:22 - welcome you're welcome thanks for
35:24 - watching uh knitting says this channel
35:27 - changed my life
35:28 - uh can you say my name yeah nitin verma
35:32 - so hopefully i'm saying that correctly
35:34 - uh please let me know if i'm not and
35:37 - i'll try to say it correctly next time
35:38 - but i'm i'm really glad that this
35:40 - channel has helped you out hopefully
35:44 - it's changed your life for the better
35:45 - i'm assuming that
35:48 - andrew says i've really enjoyed using
35:50 - emotion for css and js i'd really love
35:52 - to help with some contributions on this
35:54 - project jesse but i'm a little
35:56 - intimidated by open source
35:58 - andrew um you know check out the
36:01 - issues on our github repo and see if
36:04 - there's an issue that maybe you think
36:06 - you could handle
36:07 - and if you have any questions just
36:09 - comment on that issue i'll do my best to
36:11 - help you through it and um
36:14 - you know see if you'd if you'd like to
36:15 - contribute
36:17 - and that goes for anybody else if if you
36:20 - see something on the project where you
36:21 - you'd like to work on just you know let
36:23 - me know uh yeah check out the github
36:26 - repo and
36:27 - you know i'll try to make it as easy as
36:29 - possible for you to contribute
36:32 - um
36:34 - delian says thank you for sharing that
36:36 - knowledge you're welcome
36:38 - brandon says first time tuning in for a
36:40 - stream have been going through some of
36:43 - the pre-recorded videos this looks like
36:45 - a valuable experience to see the process
36:46 - in action oh cool well i i hope it is
36:49 - valuable uh for at least some of you uh
36:52 - so i appreciate you saying that
36:54 - uh
36:56 - so
36:57 - sofiane
36:59 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing that but it
37:01 - says what is your style syntax since
37:03 - it's not css
37:05 - um well this is jsx is the the syntax
37:09 - that we use in our react components
37:11 - and
37:15 - i'm not even sure what exactly the name
37:17 - is for doing css like this
37:21 - in jsx
37:23 - um
37:24 - is it
37:25 - cs i don't know if it's css and js or
37:29 - i don't really know to be honest with
37:31 - you if somebody knows how what the name
37:32 - of this is let me know i just i know how
37:34 - it works i just don't know what it's
37:35 - called
37:42 - let's see
37:48 - um
37:51 - ramen says sir i know a little more
37:53 - javascript can i learn react yeah if you
37:54 - know some javascript certainly you can
37:56 - you can start learning react
38:00 - um
38:05 - see groovy tuber says can you also
38:07 - upload a video on competitive
38:08 - programming um i don't have a video on
38:11 - competitive programming i don't really
38:13 - know that much about it but if if
38:15 - somebody out there has some good content
38:17 - on that um you know get in touch with
38:21 - uh
38:22 - somebody from our
38:25 - probably like quincy or beau from free
38:27 - code camp and
38:29 - let them know what your content is and
38:31 - maybe it can be put on our channel as
38:33 - well
38:35 - okay
38:36 - i'm gonna
38:37 - go back to the code now for let me check
38:39 - the time
38:41 - okay yeah let's do one more pomodoro
38:43 - session we might not even do a full
38:45 - pomodoro session
38:46 - um we're just going to try to finish
38:48 - this up a bit
38:50 - and
38:53 - then i'll answer some questions because
38:55 - really
38:57 - i actually have put in most most of the
38:59 - time i need to today in the office so i
39:01 - can go home soon
39:03 - uh
39:04 - let's see
39:08 - okay
39:09 - so for now this is okay looking
39:13 - i'm not 100 thrilled with it but
39:15 - like i said we want to launch soon so
39:17 - the goal isn't get things perfect the
39:19 - goal is get things acceptable right
39:22 - there are certain key places on the site
39:24 - that we really wanted to look very nice
39:26 - but then there are other areas that
39:29 - we can work on even after launch the
39:31 - footer is one of those areas where
39:34 - a lot of people are never even going to
39:35 - see it so
39:37 - this does not need to be perfect right
39:40 - now
39:41 - so we just have one more section left
39:43 - that doesn't have
39:45 - real content yet and that's this section
39:47 - of the footer
39:48 - so
39:49 - i would like to
39:51 - have this on another screen let me pull
39:53 - this
39:54 - so
39:56 - on the current site which is
39:57 - franciscan.edu the footer has
40:00 - links for contact us privacy policy
40:03 - directions non-discrimination statement
40:05 - and consumer information
40:07 - so it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to
40:10 - put in those same links over here
40:14 - i do want to double check and see
40:16 - if we have any of those links here
40:20 - no we don't okay yeah so i think we
40:22 - definitely want to put those links in
40:23 - the footer i like legally those are some
40:26 - pretty important links so
40:30 - let me do this i think i'm just going to
40:32 - do a regular um
40:34 - unordered list
40:36 - i'm i'm not even going to try to check
40:38 - out the materialized components for this
40:41 - because
40:42 - i'm not trying to do anything fancy i
40:44 - just need a list
40:47 - so
40:50 - let's go to our code here
40:51 - in our footer and this section
40:54 - and let's put in
40:57 - a ul
41:00 - oops why didn't that automatically make
41:05 - there we go ul and let's make an li
41:11 - okay
41:12 - and then within our yeah there we go
41:14 - within our li we want
41:17 - i want to link you know we're probably
41:20 - going to use let's use link tags
41:26 - and
41:28 - i don't think i have the links here i
41:30 - don't
41:31 - let's import
41:33 - our link tag
41:34 - which i think i have in here
41:39 - i don't
41:43 - i need to find a place where i'm using
41:45 - this
41:47 - link tag
41:51 - maybe here
41:53 - now
42:09 - all right let's see
42:13 - i have it here
42:20 - there we are
42:21 - so we're going to import link from next
42:24 - link
42:26 - so what this is going to do
42:35 - huh
42:36 - just full i don't know why i imported
42:38 - this and then
42:41 - i'm not using it let me get rid of that
42:42 - then
42:45 - so what this is going to do by using
42:46 - this link tag is it's going to let us
42:48 - pre-fetch content
42:53 - that way if a user ends up clicking on
42:55 - this what is going on here
42:58 - oh i messed this up because i don't have
43:00 - the closing tag
43:03 - there we are so if a user ends up
43:05 - clicking on one of these links the load
43:07 - time is going to be pretty much
43:08 - instantaneous because the data will
43:11 - already be loaded in in the background
43:14 - so i like to use these link tags
43:16 - um whenever i can
43:19 - and
43:21 - let's also make sure we grab
43:26 - so we need an href
43:29 - is that all we need
43:36 - i actually think we'll need more than
43:37 - that
43:44 - so because of the way we're doing
43:45 - routing we we need more than just the
43:47 - href on our link tags for them to work
43:49 - properly so i'm going to go to this
43:51 - drawer item
43:53 - and see what else we need there we are
43:56 - so we need
44:00 - this stuff
44:04 - and let's add this in now
44:09 - link and then within the link we're
44:12 - going to put an a tag
44:16 - okay and we'll just give it some text
44:22 - uh let's just say
44:24 - what's that first one contact
44:34 - okay so one of these the ahref is going
44:37 - to be
44:38 - like what actually shows up in the url
44:41 - or in the in the url bar right
44:44 - the next thing is going to be
44:51 - when we say as
44:54 - that's going to be what actually gets
44:56 - um
44:58 - put into like the router like where are
45:00 - we going to get this data from
45:02 - so
45:05 - for ahref
45:08 - i'm gonna have to look
45:10 - contact okay so in this case the href
45:13 - it's really easy we just do contact
45:16 - right
45:17 - uh the contact page but
45:19 - let me go to
45:22 - let's go to this drawer menu let's pull
45:23 - this over so you can see the ads url is
45:26 - gonna look more like this
45:28 - right
45:32 - so let's just copy and paste that so
45:34 - under our page type we're going to say
45:36 - about pages and the id that we want to
45:39 - get for that content id is going to be
45:41 - contact
45:43 - i don't know if this is 100 correct
45:45 - right now but i'm just going to use it
45:47 - just as an example
45:50 - let's see how it looks
45:55 - and
45:58 - item is not defined what i leave in
46:00 - there oops
46:01 - and we don't want
46:03 - we just want to say prefect prefetch is
46:06 - true right
46:09 - so you don't necessarily have to say
46:11 - prefetch equals true you could just put
46:14 - prefetch but i believe for newer
46:17 - versions of react um you're gonna want
46:20 - to put
46:21 - equals true i can't remember the details
46:23 - i just vaguely remember
46:26 - learning somewhere along the line that
46:28 - this is the way we want to do it now
46:31 - so that's what i'm going to do
46:32 - all right so
46:34 - we have our contacts and it gives us
46:39 - it's giving us the wrong thing
46:42 - it is
46:43 - okay
46:45 - why is it doing this
46:49 - i have these backwards
46:53 - so let's switch these up so this needs
46:55 - to say as
46:57 - yeah this makes more sense so
47:03 - so we want to get this contact content
47:05 - but we wouldn't put it as
47:07 - this this url all right let's let's save
47:11 - that and then go back here and make sure
47:13 - we're getting the right yep now it'll
47:14 - say contact i don't know if this will
47:16 - work
47:18 - hey it works wonderful
47:21 - so i did get it right
47:25 - um let's check our console and see if it
47:28 - is actually
47:30 - you all cannot appear as a descendant of
47:32 - p okay
47:34 - let's get rid of
47:35 - this typography
47:41 - or at least
47:45 - yeah let's get rid of typography for
47:47 - here since that was causing an error
47:53 - and
47:54 - let's refresh that
47:56 - see what we get now
47:58 - div cannot appear as a descendant of p
48:01 - i guess we can get rid of our typography
48:04 - component
48:07 - or else
48:09 - here
48:21 - okay
48:23 - um
48:24 - let's see what we get now
48:30 - all right cool
48:31 - not too bad we don't have errors here
48:35 - let's check our network
48:37 - and see
48:44 - i want to try to see where
48:51 - that's weird
48:52 - usually i can see what pages are trying
48:55 - to be pre-loaded
49:04 - oh you know what we're on dev mode so
49:07 - it's not going to preload uh i can't
49:08 - test it out now um
49:11 - so
49:12 - on the
49:14 - versions of the site that i actually
49:16 - have like live at a url then i could see
49:18 - if this would work so i'm not going to
49:20 - check it now because i'd have to deploy
49:22 - this you can see some of our styles are
49:24 - messed up now
49:25 - but what we can do though is just put in
49:29 - so
49:30 - where i had this um
49:37 - footer sections
49:40 - and then
49:48 - footer sections footer text
49:54 - all right let's let's do that
49:56 - um
49:58 - actually i mean it'd be easier to copy
50:00 - and paste this so let's bring this back
50:02 - in just for a second
50:03 - so i can pull this class name out
50:08 - and then now
50:16 - let's see what i can get away with here
50:19 - if i put this
50:22 - on
50:26 - on the grid container
50:30 - let's see what it'll do
50:32 - if i get away with putting it that high
50:34 - up and it still works yeah it worked
50:35 - awesome okay
50:39 - let's see we still have some odd styling
50:41 - going on here because we have the a tag
50:43 - in the list so
50:46 - let's just add in a few more
50:49 - oops
50:52 - so these allies we're gonna copy and
50:54 - paste these
50:56 - and because we need let me see
50:58 - one two three four we need four more of
51:00 - these
51:02 - one two
51:04 - oops
51:08 - three four
51:10 - okay so we need four of those
51:13 - see how that looks let me check my time
51:15 - while i'm over here all right about 12
51:17 - minutes
51:20 - okay all right there we are
51:27 - so here's our list and
51:33 - we need to
51:37 - change
51:51 - all right so on our ul let's go with uh
51:54 - style
51:57 - um
52:02 - list
52:03 - style
52:08 - none
52:09 - let's see if that works
52:11 - and they have to say list style type
52:13 - nope that works cool
52:15 - so we got rid of those little circles
52:17 - and then now we also need
52:20 - you know what let's see if this will
52:21 - work on the ul uh
52:24 - we may have to put it down lower like on
52:26 - the a tag but if we can get it to work
52:28 - on the ul that'll be great
52:30 - uh so let's go color
52:34 - and fff is going to be white
52:37 - let's see if that'll work for us
52:42 - look like it did not work let's inspect
52:45 - just to make sure
52:49 - yep so it's being overridden by
52:52 - by this
52:53 - [Music]
52:55 - okay
52:56 - so we are going to need to
52:58 - go back i guess it doesn't matter the
53:00 - footer is on every page now
53:03 - so let's get rid of that
53:08 - and instead
53:09 - on our a
53:12 - tags we're going to need to put our
53:15 - color there
53:23 - and actually since we have this color
53:25 - white i guess we could just use that
53:27 - so
53:28 - on all of our a tags
53:30 - [Music]
53:34 - let's drop down and put
53:37 - class
53:40 - class name
53:43 - now
53:44 - i would say this normally i wouldn't
53:46 - hard code a list like this out we'd
53:48 - probably just want to do a one-time map
53:51 - over um
53:53 - in an array
53:55 - that would give us all this information
53:57 - so like an array of objects and then
54:01 - only have this markup
54:03 - you know
54:04 - once right and it would map over
54:07 - but for now since there's not that many
54:09 - items i'm just going to do it like this
54:11 - all right eventually
54:13 - it will be mapped over data that we're
54:15 - getting from
54:17 - [Music]
54:19 - from our our graphql api
54:22 - no there we are
54:27 - okay
54:28 - so our class name and i don't i don't
54:31 - want those i want
54:33 - classes
54:36 - dot white
54:44 - there we are and that'll show up um
54:47 - better
54:52 - i mean it does show up better but it's
54:53 - definitely not
54:56 - great
54:58 - what's uh
54:59 - let's see what this is
55:05 - all right font size is okay but it looks
55:07 - like maybe it could use a bit bigger
55:09 - font weight so let's go with font weight
55:13 - 400
55:16 - see what that gives us
55:19 - all right 400 is definitely more
55:20 - readable
55:25 - yeah let's go with 400.
55:27 - so
55:28 - here where we have our class name
55:31 - classes white we're also going to say
55:34 - style
55:37 - and we're going to say font weight
55:42 - and we're just going to say 400 we don't
55:45 - need to put that in quotation marks
55:47 - because it's just a number right so that
55:50 - that'll work
55:51 - um if it had
55:53 - let's say
55:55 - any type of string any type of
55:57 - characters uh
55:59 - that were letters we would have to put
56:01 - it in
56:02 - quotation marks
56:05 - all right now we'd close that out with
56:07 - our double brackets hit save
56:09 - there it is
56:11 - just to kind of get an idea
56:13 - i'm going to change a few of these
56:15 - so that it's not just contact because it
56:18 - looks weird right now
56:23 - privacy privies
56:26 - yeah that's how you spell privacy
56:29 - um
56:34 - directions all right just a few
56:37 - just to see
56:40 - okay
56:41 - all right not bad um there's too much
56:44 - padding
56:45 - on the top i do want to see why that's
56:47 - there
56:49 - it looks like that's on the ul itself
56:52 - so let's
56:54 - get rid of that
56:56 - and do we need it on the bottom two
57:01 - no we don't really need that on the
57:02 - bottom i think we're fine
57:05 - with the normal amount of padding oh
57:07 - what happened here
57:11 - okay something happened here
57:16 - let's fix that as well
57:22 - oh attack
57:28 - all right
57:38 - okay so we don't want it on there
57:42 - okay
57:44 - all right so for some reason
57:59 - footer sections
58:01 - so we've given this container div
58:06 - container grid that
58:09 - maybe that was a mistake
58:12 - good
58:14 - item
58:18 - yeah you know what this needs to be
58:21 - outside of here then
58:25 - see what it does now put it outside
58:28 - there we are
58:30 - okay
58:31 - yeah so we needed that to be outside of
58:33 - the main container
58:34 - div so if you didn't see what just
58:37 - happened we had a margin here because
58:40 - this section was actually inside of the
58:43 - container div for all these sections and
58:46 - that container div had a
58:49 - margin here 16 pixels so once we moved
58:51 - it outside of that container it was free
58:54 - to take up the full width right
58:58 - okay
59:01 - now let's get rid of that
59:03 - and it should be
59:04 - looking pretty good
59:07 - so on our ul
59:12 - let's just add one more style here and
59:14 - this is going to be margin
59:18 - zero
59:22 - and if that takes care of our problem
59:25 - great we're good okay so the margin is
59:27 - knocked off the bottom
59:29 - this is a lot thinner i probably would
59:31 - want to make this margin a bit bigger if
59:34 - i was like really trying to make this
59:35 - perfect i would want it to match this
59:38 - margin on the top but for now i'm okay
59:40 - with it
59:43 - yeah so that's pretty good uh what i
59:44 - would need to do here obviously is put
59:46 - in the correct text
59:49 - and all the correct info for the links
59:52 - for these things in the footer
59:55 - and i might think about
60:00 - maybe centering this uh but doing it in
60:03 - a way where
60:05 - it would still be straight along this
60:07 - edge right
60:08 - if that makes sense
60:11 - other than that that's fine for the
60:13 - footer maybe you could see like
60:15 - this needs to be up on the same line as
60:18 - the rest of this street address so the
60:20 - zip code needs to be up
60:23 - um
60:25 - yeah
60:28 - these links need the the right urls as
60:31 - well
60:35 - not bad
60:40 - okay cool um
60:45 - let me take
60:47 - all right about three minutes uh and
60:49 - this time i'm going to
60:52 - commit this
60:53 - and then push it to github so if you're
60:55 - not familiar with how that works in
60:57 - github then
60:58 - um
60:59 - i'll try to explain what i'm doing as we
61:01 - go along so we're going to get status
61:03 - just to see what's changed so
61:05 - as expected we've only changed this one
61:07 - component our footer.js component
61:10 - so we're going to do a git add and i'm
61:12 - just going to put in a period and
61:14 - that'll just add everything which in
61:16 - this case is just one
61:18 - one file you can actually put in the
61:20 - name of the file if you just want to add
61:21 - one among many files one or two or
61:24 - however many you want
61:26 - and then i'm going to say yarn cm
61:30 - actually first i'm going to do yarn unit
61:34 - u so i'm going to update our snapshots
61:38 - for our unit tests
61:40 - uh
61:41 - just to make sure
61:43 - that what we've changed isn't uh messing
61:45 - anything up so you can see the
61:47 - index.test.js has been updated because
61:49 - we have we're using this footer
61:51 - component in index
61:53 - so
61:54 - if we hadn't have updated it when we
61:56 - tried to run all of our tests to make
61:58 - sure that our changes didn't break
62:00 - anything it would have failed to test
62:02 - right so that's why we're running that
62:03 - first
62:05 - now i'm going to do another get ad
62:07 - because our snapshot
62:10 - has been updated so you can see here our
62:13 - snapshot for index.js has been updated
62:16 - now we can do yarn cm
62:19 - which is basically just like running a
62:21 - git commit with a a message
62:24 - but this is just gonna walk us through
62:26 - how to craft a really nice commit
62:29 - message so we're gonna say we're gonna
62:31 - add a new feature
62:32 - all right and i'm going to skip the
62:34 - scope we're only dealing with one
62:36 - component it's it's okay it'll be
62:37 - obvious what component was changed
62:40 - and now i'm going to say that we
62:42 - see add buttons
62:45 - and
62:46 - um link list
62:48 - to
62:49 - footer
62:50 - okay
62:51 - just basically describing what we did
62:53 - right we're going to say we're going to
62:55 - do this like present tense right so
62:57 - that's why we say add buttons a link
62:59 - list a footer let's hit enter i'm not
63:01 - going to put a longer description right
63:02 - now because it's not very complicated
63:04 - what we did
63:05 - if it was more complex it would be a
63:07 - good idea to put a long description
63:09 - there
63:10 - uh we didn't break anything so we're
63:12 - going to go no with that and we didn't
63:13 - have any issues as far as i remember
63:16 - that dealt with this footer so i'm going
63:18 - to say no to that as well if we did have
63:20 - an issue we would just reference that
63:22 - issue number
63:23 - and then
63:24 - it would automatically put a little note
63:27 - in that issue
63:28 - with a reference to this commit or if we
63:31 - had said fix and then put the issue
63:33 - number it would have automatically
63:34 - closed that issue for us which is pretty
63:37 - awesome so you can see that we passed
63:41 - all our our unit tests
63:43 - we also pass our end to end tests
63:46 - and
63:48 - now we can just do a get push
63:51 - and that's going to push all our changes
63:53 - up to our github repository so now you
63:56 - all can check out that repo and
63:58 - everything that we've done today will be
63:59 - there
64:00 - obviously need to
64:02 - perfect that a bit need to finish out
64:05 - adding in some data but the basic layout
64:07 - right the markup is going to remain the
64:09 - same
64:12 - okay
64:13 - so
64:15 - now i'm going to take the rest of the
64:16 - stream
64:19 - to
64:21 - answer questions and let me just show
64:23 - you
64:25 - i'm going to show you briefly i haven't
64:26 - showed it for a long time what i'm doing
64:28 - here so we're going to add content to
64:30 - footer i estimated that this will take
64:32 - me two pomodoro sessions and we just
64:34 - spent two pomodoro sessions on that so
64:36 - i'm going to say it took two out of two
64:38 - this is in my trello board right and now
64:42 - um
64:43 - actually be honest i'm gonna leave this
64:45 - in in progress since i still have a bit
64:47 - of content to put in there
64:49 - probably if i didn't do it live i could
64:51 - have got it all in but as i'm explaining
64:53 - things it does take a bit longer so
64:56 - this is going to be in my column of in
64:58 - progress right
65:00 - once we're done with it we can move it
65:01 - to completed if it needs testing i'll
65:03 - move it to testing first okay but this
65:06 - is my trello board and has all the stuff
65:08 - that needs to be done assigned to the
65:10 - people that need to do it my to-do list
65:12 - my ready for dev stuff this is all stuff
65:14 - that i i really want to get done this
65:16 - week
65:17 - okay and then here's my completed list
65:19 - and each one of these that i'm working
65:21 - on has estimates for how long it will
65:23 - take and then once i'd actually do it i
65:26 - say here's how long it actually did take
65:28 - and these are broken down by pomodoro
65:30 - sessions okay and then not only that
65:32 - but then also here
65:35 - i have my project timesheet so we can
65:37 - see today's date uh august 30th which is
65:41 - uh my daughter gemma's birthday she just
65:44 - turned seven today and then i have my
65:46 - time which i'm a little bit behind my on
65:49 - how much time i've been spending but uh
65:51 - let's just say we took about 50 minutes
65:55 - right two pomodoro sessions for this and
65:58 - let's see
65:59 - [Music]
66:02 - footer
66:03 - add content to footer so i'm keeping
66:05 - track of every day how many how much
66:07 - time i spend now this doesn't take into
66:09 - account things like uh meetings which do
66:12 - take up a lot of time or any
66:14 - correspondence for the site
66:16 - and um
66:17 - so i'm not perfect with this so usually
66:19 - this is this estimate is less time than
66:22 - it really takes but so far on this
66:24 - project it's over 250
66:27 - hours of work
66:28 - um
66:30 - like i said minus meetings
66:32 - and usually like some research time and
66:35 - stuff like that
66:36 - um
66:38 - so that's how i keep track of things
66:41 - for my projects i do this for all of my
66:43 - projects
66:48 - all right so let's go back to
66:51 - the live chat
66:54 - i'm going to scroll back up to where i
66:55 - left off
66:57 - so if you have any other questions right
66:58 - now feel free to put them in the live
67:00 - chat now and i'll try to get to
67:02 - everything
67:08 - uh this office says hi from india hey
67:11 - how's it going thanks for watching
67:14 - uh phillips says i know some view how
67:16 - different between viewing react react i
67:18 - haven't used view before so i don't
67:19 - really know how different view and react
67:22 - are so sorry has anybody used view and
67:24 - react and can give us a comparison of
67:26 - you know how how similar or different
67:28 - they are
67:31 - uh
67:33 - martial
67:34 - sorry if i'm pronouncing that wrong
67:36 - but says
67:37 - i was just checking how to contribute on
67:39 - open source but i couldn't find any
67:41 - videos for beginners you have any
67:42 - recommendations thanks
67:44 - um
67:47 - you know what off the top of my head i
67:48 - can't think of any videos
67:50 - i'm pretty sure i have seen some out
67:52 - there though on how to contribute
67:54 - um
68:00 - yeah there's got to be some i'm
68:01 - surprised there's not one on the free
68:03 - code camp youtube channel to be honest
68:05 - with you so if you haven't searched
68:07 - through free code camp
68:09 - uh try it try that
68:14 - conrad asks if i've tried styled
68:15 - components yes i have you styled
68:17 - components on a react native project
68:19 - that i was working on a few months ago
68:21 - uh i i kind of like styled components
68:24 - it's a little bit different so i'm not
68:29 - i'm not great with style components yet
68:33 - but it's something i would like to work
68:35 - more with
68:39 - uh fuzzy and says thanks for your
68:42 - helpful tips you're welcome
68:44 - uh thanks thanks for saying that thanks
68:46 - for watching
68:48 - uh ultravid says i'm totally new to
68:50 - coding but i want to learn more i know a
68:51 - little html all right cool well that's a
68:53 - good place to start
68:55 - i definitely recommend going to
68:56 - freecodecamp.org and checking out the
68:58 - lessons and it'll start you out with
69:00 - html move into css and then into
69:03 - javascript and and beyond um so if you
69:06 - want to learn more
69:08 - definitely check that out
69:11 - robert says
69:12 - uh would you make a video about redux in
69:15 - the future uh maybe maybe if we use
69:17 - redux i do have a video on my youtube
69:20 - channel
69:21 - uh so i believe there's a link to my
69:23 - youtube channel in the description
69:25 - uh it's i
69:27 - if you search jesse weigle on youtube
69:29 - you'll probably find it
69:32 - but i have a video and i think it's
69:34 - react native live coding is the title of
69:36 - the video
69:39 - is that what it is
69:42 - no you know what that's not it
69:43 - uh well that is a video on my channel
69:45 - but the one where i use redux is on the
69:48 - free code cam channel if you search
69:50 - react native and redux
69:52 - you should see one of my videos where we
69:54 - work with react native and redux so
69:57 - check that out
70:00 - i may do more in the future
70:03 - but for now you can check that out and i
70:05 - think it was maybe project three
70:09 - i think that's what it was
70:15 - let's see
70:16 - um so
70:20 - so sofiane says thank you has jsx style
70:24 - advantages
70:25 - um on css there are some advantages so
70:30 - if if what you're creating with the
70:32 - styles is just a javascript object like
70:34 - i'll go i'll show it again here on the
70:36 - screen
70:37 - then you can do
70:39 - javascript right so so any calculations
70:42 - you could normally do with javascript
70:44 - functions whatever you could do inside
70:47 - here
70:48 - and
70:49 - so you so you could do more
70:52 - than you could normally with with css
70:54 - more like dynamic things right
71:05 - um vishal says please upload a video
71:07 - about how to build programming logic
71:13 - i
71:13 - don't have a video about that the other
71:15 - thing is too um you know i'm one of many
71:18 - contributors to free code camp so a lot
71:20 - of this stuff like there may be videos
71:22 - about this already on free code camp
71:24 - that i don't even know about because we
71:25 - have so much content here on the youtube
71:27 - channel
71:33 - uh
71:35 - call your says please
71:37 - tell me which website is best for
71:39 - learning html css
71:41 - i'm new to coding and which language i
71:44 - have i first have to learn
71:47 - check out freecodecamp.org
71:49 - and go through their html and css
71:51 - lessons and see what you think
71:55 - uh robert also mentions codeacademy yeah
71:58 - that's that's also a good place to go
72:00 - i've i've done their lessons as well
72:05 - the latest music also recommends
72:07 - w3schools
72:09 - uh i i did use those
72:11 - back in the day
72:13 - i i prefer free code camp and codecademy
72:15 - over w3 schools to be honest with you
72:18 - the only advantage i saw with w3schools
72:20 - is uh
72:23 - their lessons seem to have a lot more
72:24 - reading at least they used to a lot more
72:26 - reading and less hands-on stuff so if
72:29 - you only have time to read and not to
72:31 - actually type or anything
72:33 - then there are things you could read
72:35 - there
72:36 - um i find that uh mozilla developer
72:39 - network has more detailed information
72:42 - which sometimes is overwhelming if
72:44 - you're starting out though but if you
72:45 - wanted more details
72:47 - check them out instead of
72:49 - schools
72:54 - um so according to you which programming
72:56 - language should i go with first
72:59 - um it for sure if you want to do
73:01 - anything with front-end web development
73:03 - go with javascript
73:05 - if you're not sure what you want to do
73:07 - go with javascript because it's so
73:09 - versatile and can be used
73:11 - really for nearly anything that you
73:13 - would want to use a programming
73:14 - programming language for
73:16 - if you know specifically what you want
73:18 - to do then there may be another
73:20 - programming language that is is better
73:22 - suited to that thing so for instance
73:25 - um data science seems to rely
73:28 - more on an r
73:30 - uh python same like machine learning
73:33 - relies a lot on python
73:35 - if you want to work with like dot net
73:37 - framework stuff maybe you want to try uh
73:40 - c sharp
73:41 - uh if you're into wordpress or drupal
73:44 - you want to go with php right so it
73:46 - depends on what you want to do but just
73:48 - in general
73:50 - uh javascript is a good thing to go with
73:53 - because
73:54 - you know if you're doing anything on the
73:56 - web you're probably going to need to
73:57 - know javascript at some point
74:04 - okay robert also reiterated that mdn is
74:07 - is a better resource
74:09 - than
74:13 - let's w3schools
74:17 - uh
74:19 - kyug says one more thing which
74:21 - programming language is good for app
74:22 - development
74:24 - it depends on what you want to do if you
74:26 - want to use react native to develop apps
74:28 - then javascript is great
74:30 - if you want to develop just ios apps
74:32 - then maybe you want to learn swift
74:34 - if you want to develop android apps then
74:37 - you could learn java or kotlin
74:40 - right um
74:42 - so there are a lot of options
74:44 - right i
74:46 - i like using javascript with react
74:48 - native for mobile apps because
74:51 - you just learn javascript and you can
74:54 - make apps for android or ios
74:58 - and that's especially good if you don't
75:00 - really know what you want to specialize
75:02 - in one or the other right you know
75:04 - basically you get
75:05 - you get to do more
75:07 - with learning only one language great
75:14 - vibe says how do you start how do you
75:17 - start learning programming
75:20 - i don't know if you're asking in general
75:23 - like how would you start learning
75:24 - programming or you want to know like my
75:26 - personal story so i'm gonna say like in
75:29 - general
75:30 - check out freecodecamp.org i know i keep
75:32 - saying that but it's a great resource
75:34 - um
75:36 - and that will get you a nice intro to
75:37 - programming
75:38 - you know if you want to do you could do
75:40 - udacity for their courses you could do
75:43 - codecademy for their stuff too
75:45 - uh free codecamp is not the only
75:47 - resource out there but it is free
75:49 - and i think it's quite good
76:07 - let's see
76:13 - uh and emery says you can also use solo
76:16 - learn okay so i haven't used solo learn
76:18 - but there's another i guess another
76:20 - recommended resource there for memory
76:33 - uh emory also is asking what the name of
76:35 - the software is and then later on says
76:36 - visual studio code it is visual studio
76:38 - code
76:46 - uh cali says html and css are both
76:48 - interlinked right
76:49 - yeah so um html is like your your
76:53 - markup for the page right so
76:56 - if you're building a house html is is
76:58 - like your frame the wood that you would
77:00 - use right the bricks for the house
77:03 - css would be like the paint
77:05 - right
77:06 - um the decorations in your house right
77:09 - so
77:10 - css makes html look nicer when it's
77:13 - rendered in the browser to the user
77:15 - right
77:17 - javascript would be like all the moving
77:20 - parts and things like the electricity in
77:22 - the house the thing that opens your
77:23 - garage door the lights you know the
77:26 - switches right that's what makes things
77:27 - move
77:28 - it makes things happen
77:38 - mishra says thank you for being live and
77:40 - teaching us about react yeah no problem
77:42 - thank you for watching
77:47 - uh calyuk says some websites only teach
77:50 - html while others only css where to get
77:52 - both at the same time uh yeah free code
77:54 - cam for sure you can get both at the
77:56 - same time it's going to start with html
77:58 - and then very quickly go into css as
78:00 - well
78:02 - which is the right way to go i mean you
78:03 - definitely want to learn html first
78:05 - otherwise css doesn't really make much
78:07 - sense because css is going to
78:10 - um do things
78:13 - it's going to build on your html
78:15 - right css targets html elements if you
78:19 - don't know what an html element is it's
78:21 - going to be difficult to understand what
78:24 - css is doing
78:39 - these
78:54 - um david asks what's the framework
78:56 - you're using for adding the git commit
78:58 - details like that uh it's called
79:01 - committed
79:02 - so i'll show you my package json
79:08 - here we go
79:10 - commit is in
79:14 - i'll paste that in
79:16 - in the live chat too
79:32 - let's see
79:33 - raul says what programming language is
79:35 - this it's javascript in particular it's
79:38 - a javascript library called react and
79:41 - the syntax is jsx
79:59 - see
80:00 - the non-jay says hey jesse how are you
80:03 - not bad uh pretty busy lately but uh not
80:07 - not too bad
80:08 - um
80:10 - so here's like a few minutes about me
80:13 - since dante asks how i'm doing and i
80:15 - haven't talked with you all for a while
80:17 - so
80:18 - me
80:19 - personally been pretty busy my
80:22 - my prolonged
80:24 - trip to utah and then to new york city
80:27 - threw me completely off my schedule
80:30 - so finally getting back on my schedule
80:32 - of getting good sleep and i'm back on my
80:35 - diet
80:36 - and i need to get back on my workout
80:38 - routine not quite back there yet
80:40 - my wrist is still healing from the
80:42 - surgery still hurts so i won't really be
80:45 - able to work out like a hundred percent
80:48 - um
80:50 - and then
80:51 - i'm going to
80:53 - uh
80:54 - try to get this website launched as fast
80:56 - as i can i guess
80:58 - assuming that nothing else happens like
81:01 - in terms of like changes or anything
81:03 - that get requested
81:05 - which keep up it keeps happening
81:08 - um
81:09 - yeah but that's what's going on with me
81:11 - thanks for asking
81:13 - how are you doing dinanji
81:16 - uh see brandon says what is your setup
81:19 - hardware was i'm looking into purchasing
81:20 - a new macbook air but i'm not sure if it
81:22 - will be powerful enough for web
81:24 - development and running windows 10 and
81:25 - parallels
81:27 - um
81:28 - the macbook air can definitely do web
81:30 - development but i have no idea about
81:32 - running windows 10 as well
81:35 - i don't really know about this my setup
81:37 - in my office
81:39 - at work is a
81:42 - an imac with 32 gigs of ram
81:45 - uh and it can handle two external
81:48 - monitors you know plus the imac one and
81:51 - streaming and it's fine
81:52 - i have a macbook pro
81:55 - that is also fine with two external
81:57 - monitors for web development but when i
81:59 - try to live stream as well
82:02 - it gets a little sluggish
82:04 - so
82:06 - but i i've never tried to also run
82:09 - windows 10 on either of these machines
82:17 - mammy says i've learned so much
82:20 - just watching
82:22 - then then i could do i really appreciate
82:24 - your help so much
82:25 - um
82:27 - so thank you
82:28 - oh you're welcome thank you so much for
82:30 - saying that
82:33 - um
82:35 - ilya says where do you live
82:37 - i live in the united states in ohio so i
82:40 - live in a a small city called
82:42 - steubenville ohio it's right on the
82:44 - eastern border of ohio and if you're
82:46 - familiar with pittsburgh which is a much
82:48 - bigger city that's like the closest big
82:50 - city to me
82:52 - i'm actually pretty close to uh to
82:55 - pittsburgh
82:56 - so if i drive
82:58 - maybe about a half hour drive
83:01 - i'm in pittsburgh so
83:05 - not sure if that helps you figure out
83:06 - where i'm at but that's that's where i
83:08 - am
83:13 - uh rohit says can we use python for
83:15 - android application development
83:17 - i've never heard of anybody using python
83:19 - for that but
83:21 - it maybe is possible i've i've never
83:24 - never really thought of it though
83:26 - usually for android if you're gonna do
83:28 - it like completely native then you are
83:31 - gonna use java or kotlin
83:34 - if you
83:35 - want to use javascript you could use
83:38 - something like
83:39 - ionic
83:41 - or
83:42 - react native
83:46 - dead zombie recommends checking out the
83:48 - net ninja on youtube uh for beginners uh
83:52 - stuff so i'm assuming like html
83:53 - javascript css
83:58 - okay danko says it is possible to use
84:02 - python for android application
84:03 - development um but it's it's not great
84:07 - not exactly what he said but or with
84:09 - with days he or she said i'm not sure
84:12 - um
84:14 - let's see
84:15 - joseph says hello hey joseph how's it
84:17 - going
84:19 - uh joseph s is that styled components or
84:22 - emotion
84:23 - uh neither i'm not using either one of
84:25 - those right now
84:27 - no least not on this project
84:31 - uh calyuk says you have cleared 99 of my
84:34 - doubts thanks brother god bless love
84:37 - from india oh thank you
84:39 - thank you i appreciate that
84:41 - i'm glad i could help
84:45 - uh world says how do you avoid getting
84:47 - bored of coding hmm
84:51 - i don't know i mean i like working on
84:52 - new things
84:53 - i like coding
84:56 - um
84:58 - other things too like there are some
85:00 - specific tasks that are really boring
85:03 - but coding in general i'm always excited
85:04 - about because i can always do um
85:07 - like new things you know
85:09 - i always try to use some new technique
85:11 - or new technology and every time i do a
85:14 - new project
85:15 - uh also like for boredom listening to
85:18 - good spotify playlists while i'm trying
85:19 - to do the really boring stuff helps
85:21 - caffeine helps
85:24 - um stuff like that so
85:27 - and i generally like i like coding if
85:29 - somebody really didn't like it i could
85:31 - definitely see boredom being um like a
85:34 - bigger issue
85:37 - really it says tell me about python i
85:40 - don't know that much about python i've
85:41 - only done limited stuff with it uh the
85:44 - thing about python that i remember most
85:46 - is that
85:47 - there's not a lot of special characters
85:49 - for the syntax like for instance with
85:51 - javascript you're using a lot of
85:53 - different brackets curly brackets you
85:55 - know regular brackets
85:57 - parentheses and things like that with
86:00 - python a lot of your syntax is
86:02 - determined by
86:04 - your indentation
86:06 - so you're not going to have a bunch of
86:08 - semicolons everywhere in python so
86:10 - that's it's kind of interesting
86:13 - i liked python when i did use it but i
86:15 - just don't have any need for it and most
86:18 - of the work that i get paid for
86:21 - uh this shawl says can you teach some
86:23 - advanced c and c plus plus concepts
86:25 - i'm not i'm not really qualified to
86:27 - teach c in c plus plus it's been so long
86:30 - since i've used either one of those
86:32 - languages and even when i did use them
86:34 - it was just very basic so um
86:37 - you know maybe somebody else on the free
86:40 - code camp channel has already done
86:41 - something about that or will do
86:43 - something but
86:44 - um
86:45 - i i'm afraid that i wouldn't be such a
86:48 - great teacher on those things
86:50 - gabriel says have you ever implemented
86:52 - authentication and authorization with
86:54 - graphql
86:56 - as you did
86:57 - um
87:00 - i guess not really
87:02 - normally on projects where we've had
87:04 - stuff like that with graphql um
87:07 - harshit who watches the stream and
87:10 - contributes frequently harshid has
87:12 - handled that
87:14 - so i can't really help with that
87:17 - i wish i could
87:19 - world says why did you go to utah seems
87:22 - kind of random okay so react rally is
87:24 - held in salt lake city utah
87:27 - so i was at the reactor rally conference
87:29 - in salt lake city and then went uh to
87:34 - right after that i went to new york city
87:36 - for a free code camp top contributor
87:39 - uh meetup
87:40 - uh that was held in in brooklyn in new
87:42 - york city
87:44 - so that's why i was i was gone it was
87:46 - the longest i've ever been away from
87:48 - uh from my family
87:50 - uh on my own and so that was a little
87:52 - bit weird it was a bit a bit lonely
87:54 - um but it was awesome to meet a lot of
87:58 - other developers and free code camp
87:59 - contributors it was cool to see like i'd
88:02 - never been to utah
88:03 - you know let alone salt lake city
88:05 - um
88:07 - so it was cool to see that area of the
88:09 - country much
88:11 - uh different even like the climate's
88:13 - different um just
88:16 - the the landscape the plants like
88:18 - everything's so different in utah from
88:20 - where i am i live
88:22 - and i haven't been in new york city in
88:23 - 13 years so going back to new york city
88:25 - was fun i'd actually never been to
88:27 - brooklyn i'd only been to manhattan
88:29 - before so
88:30 - uh that was cool it was really cool i
88:32 - walked i just spent a lot of time
88:34 - walking around
88:35 - i walked around a little bit in in salt
88:37 - lake city but i i just
88:39 - spent like a whole day at night just
88:41 - walking around new york just checking
88:42 - everything out
88:43 - uh
88:44 - it was cool
88:48 - um let's see
88:50 - uh
88:51 - meek x says if you use the cdn for react
88:55 - and only
88:56 - one js file for all the code how do you
89:00 - link all the navigation links to the
89:02 - different parts of that page
89:11 - hmm
89:16 - i don't know
89:20 - i mean i guess
89:22 - if within your one file you broke things
89:25 - out into different components
89:28 - right but it was within one file like
89:30 - you defined multiple components in the
89:31 - one file
89:32 - your navigation could probably call
89:36 - those different components
89:38 - right
89:40 - i'm not 100 sure but that's how i would
89:43 - go about it i i suppose
89:53 - uh nikhil says hi hey how's it going
89:58 - uh
89:59 - solrav says best books to learn coding
90:02 - uh if you're trying to learn javascript
90:04 - i would check out the you don't know js
90:06 - series which is available for free
90:09 - online
90:10 - or you could get the book and the
90:12 - eloquent javascript book which is also
90:15 - available for free online or you can pay
90:17 - for the print copy
90:18 - those those two books you don't know js
90:21 - is really a series of books but those
90:22 - two resources uh
90:25 - i've been impressed with and i've i've
90:27 - read through those i like them
90:29 - i don't know if i finished eloquent
90:31 - javascript though to be honest with you
90:33 - so
90:34 - or you don't know js to be honest with
90:36 - you i'm not sure if i finish either one
90:38 - of those those books other series of
90:40 - books but i really liked what i did read
90:42 - of them
90:44 - um
90:45 - let's see
90:49 - and nico also said best book for react
90:52 - i've never read any books about react so
90:54 - i i really don't know if anybody else
90:56 - has any recommendations please you know
90:58 - put them in the in the chat now or in
91:00 - the comments the video if you're
91:01 - watching this later on
91:04 - uh
91:05 - mammy says if you are bored
91:07 - you do not like it i do not get bored
91:10 - and can't do it it makes you think you
91:12 - ponder
91:14 - yeah that's true right if you really
91:16 - like something you're not going to get
91:17 - bored with it
91:18 - um
91:19 - i mean there there are some parts about
91:22 - coding that are kind of boring
91:24 - um but usually those are things that you
91:27 - could probably just write a function to
91:30 - do for you right so depending on how you
91:32 - approach it it may or may not be that
91:34 - that boring right
91:38 - uh robert says i think boredom comes
91:40 - from too much studying when people apply
91:42 - the knowledge they've obtained and try
91:43 - to to troubleshoot that's when you won't
91:45 - be bored anymore
91:47 - yeah that actually that makes a lot of
91:48 - sense like actually building something
91:51 - is usually like never boring like trying
91:53 - to just read through material and learn
91:55 - that can be boring so i do recommend
91:58 - learning programming mostly by actually
92:01 - building things and then only reading
92:03 - about something when you need to use it
92:06 - uh that seems to be the way you'll
92:08 - you'll learn a lot
92:10 - more quickly that way and you'll build
92:12 - cool stuff while you're doing it
92:15 - nikhil asks what's python used for uh
92:18 - robert says python used for basically
92:19 - everything yeah i mean but you can do a
92:21 - lot of different stuff with python in
92:23 - particular python does seem to be used
92:26 - for uh machine learning
92:28 - uh quite a bit
92:29 - but it yeah it's also
92:32 - i mean you could you could build any
92:34 - anything with python
92:36 - really like any
92:38 - background says what ide do you use for
92:41 - coding
92:42 - uh this is visual studio code
92:47 - uh nikhil says but why he said not for
92:49 - android well android
92:52 - so like certain platforms you use a
92:54 - certain language so like android uses
92:56 - java or kotlin um
93:00 - ios uses swift
93:03 - if you want to do a wordpress website
93:06 - it's built with php so like certain
93:08 - platforms have already been built around
93:10 - a certain programming language right
93:13 - um
93:15 - if you wanted to build an entirely new
93:18 - mobile operating system you could
93:20 - certainly build it in python right
93:23 - but since the android operating system
93:25 - is already built in a certain way then
93:27 - it only runs certain code right so
93:30 - there's probably some way to build an
93:32 - app for android in python and then have
93:35 - it converted to stuff that the android
93:38 - operating system can handle
93:41 - probably java
93:42 - right
93:43 - hopefully that makes sense
93:49 - all right and that's it that's the oops
93:51 - actually um
93:53 - this shawl says what is the spring
93:55 - framework i don't really know i've heard
93:57 - of it but i have no idea what it is i
94:00 - can't even remember where i've heard it
94:01 - now
94:02 - uh
94:04 - i am
94:06 - amin or amine i'm not sure how to
94:08 - pronounce that says thank you for
94:09 - everything jesse from morocco
94:12 - oh you're welcome thank you for uh for
94:14 - watching morocco is one of the places
94:16 - that i really would like to visit i've
94:17 - seen a lot of cool
94:19 - uh tv shows about like people taking
94:21 - trips to morocco and it seems like a
94:23 - really
94:24 - really cool place cool like culture and
94:26 - food and everything so anyway
94:28 - maybe one day i'll get a chance to go to
