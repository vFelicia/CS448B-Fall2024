00:00 - this will be a ui and ux design tutorial
00:04 - that takes you from being xero to a hero
00:06 - in creating a website from the ground up
00:09 - we're gonna do this in several parts
00:12 - first we're gonna have a look at how to
00:14 - do a wireframe so that we can make the
00:17 - website design and sketch it out we're
00:19 - going to turn this into a light mock-up
00:22 - using figma where we essentially plan
00:24 - out the elements that we want to create
00:27 - in this design and finally we're going
00:29 - to create all the images and text to
00:32 - turn this into a fully fledged website
00:34 - design
00:35 - this whole process will be done over an
00:37 - hour where i'll take you through every
00:39 - single step so that if you need to
00:41 - understand how that process goes the
00:43 - design thinking the user interface the
00:46 - user experience between each part then
00:49 - this video will help you out now my name
00:51 - is adrian i do videos around design and
00:54 - development you can check out my channel
00:56 - in the link in the description below and
00:58 - it's a channel that does all sorts of
01:00 - stuff from design to development
01:03 - and if you're looking to improve your
01:04 - skills as well but this is the free code
01:07 - cam channel and this channel has great
01:10 - resources as well for all things
01:12 - development related so hopefully this
01:14 - will be an introduction to improving
01:16 - your designs in general whenever you're
01:18 - jumping into any type of project
01:20 - before we get started make sure you guys
01:22 - hit like and subscribe and without
01:24 - further ado let's just jump straight
01:26 - into it
01:30 - if you're planning on designing or
01:33 - developing a website before you get
01:34 - started it's really important to be able
01:36 - to do wireframing so that both you and
01:39 - the client has a good idea of what it is
01:41 - exactly that you're building and how
01:43 - it'll work
01:44 - in this video i wanted to talk a little
01:45 - bit more about wireframing what it is
01:48 - how it works and we'll even build out a
01:50 - wireframe so you guys can see the full
01:52 - process and we'll build this example out
01:54 - over here
01:55 - if you haven't heard of me before that's
01:56 - fine i'm adrien from australia i do
01:59 - videos around design and development and
02:00 - you can check out my channel in the
02:02 - description below but without further
02:03 - ado let's just jump straight into it if
02:06 - you haven't heard of wireframing before
02:08 - that's fine what it is is essentially a
02:10 - visual blueprint for how the website
02:12 - will work as well as the pages
02:13 - themselves and it also works as a schema
02:17 - for the functionality of a system so
02:19 - that you get a better representation of
02:21 - what's going on it's really useful and
02:23 - it's really easy to do as well it can
02:25 - take a number of forms you could just
02:27 - use a piece of paper and sketch it out
02:30 - or you could use your ipad or even one
02:32 - of the third-party websites which allow
02:34 - you to do wireframing these days we're
02:36 - going to take a look at a few of these
02:38 - examples to see how we can build our own
02:40 - wireframe but if you want to get started
02:42 - on your own you can get started with
02:43 - just a piece of paper and if you're
02:45 - worried that you're not a ui designer
02:47 - and a graphics designer in general and
02:49 - you're not too sure what's going on well
02:51 - you don't have to worry about any of
02:53 - that because wireframing doesn't require
02:55 - really any understanding of ui you just
02:58 - need the bare essentials of being able
03:00 - to draw boxes in circles we're not going
03:02 - to look into colors we're not going to
03:04 - look into content or logos or any of
03:06 - that wireframing is just the way that
03:09 - the pages will work and anyone who's
03:12 - doing design or development will be able
03:13 - to jump straight into it so let's take a
03:16 - look at how we get started by creating
03:18 - our very first wireframe
03:20 - in this example i'm going to be using my
03:23 - ipad and i'm going to be using an
03:25 - application called concepts which is
03:27 - just made for drawing but i'll put a
03:30 - link in the description below so that
03:32 - you guys can download it if that's
03:33 - something you guys want to use otherwise
03:35 - you can use a pen and paper just as well
03:39 - the very first thing i like to do before
03:41 - i even begin my wireframing and
03:43 - something that i think is really
03:45 - important is creating your site map
03:48 - the sitemap gives your entire website
03:50 - direction so that you know what pages
03:53 - you're building
03:54 - and with most sitemaps the very first
03:56 - thing that you start off with is a home
03:59 - page every other page flows out of that
04:02 - home page so you want to begin with that
04:04 - and the very first thing you want to do
04:06 - is probably write out the most important
04:09 - pages you have so besides the home page
04:11 - this is usually things like the services
04:14 - page or the product page or the contact
04:16 - us page these pages are the core of your
04:20 - website and if you're doing an
04:22 - application in this case maybe these are
04:24 - your main screens that you want to route
04:26 - to
04:27 - but these are the ones that have sub
04:29 - pages under them as well
04:31 - by creating a sitemap just very simply
04:34 - and visually like this you'll be able to
04:37 - show and represent how all the pages
04:39 - work together if there are some pages
04:42 - you can branch them out as well and if
04:44 - some pages are linked to others sideways
04:46 - you can draw arrows to represent that
04:50 - in this example we're going to just
04:52 - start off with something very simple so
04:54 - what i want to be able to do is just an
04:56 - about us page maybe a features page and
04:59 - a home page and what we'll do is we'll
05:01 - design these as wireframes once we draw
05:03 - out the sitemap and we might even create
05:05 - a responsive design for them but to
05:08 - start off with let's create and finish
05:10 - up this site map just to see what we're
05:12 - going to be creating in this video today
05:15 - now that we have the site map done let's
05:18 - start off with our very first page and
05:21 - the first page we usually start on is
05:24 - the home page the home page usually
05:27 - represents the design that we're going
05:29 - to be utilizing for the rest of the
05:31 - pages and two of the most important
05:34 - parts of a home page are the header with
05:38 - its navigation and menu as well as its
05:40 - footer because that's going to exist on
05:43 - most of the other pages
05:44 - what we'll start off doing is creating a
05:48 - layout here for the home page and
05:50 - usually what i like to do is create it
05:52 - so it's quite wide we can zoom into it
05:55 - and we have enough there for almost 12
05:57 - columns so that if we want to use things
05:59 - like bootstrap or other tools to do the
06:03 - layout they're ready to go otherwise we
06:05 - can always do our own layout for the ui
06:09 - for the first part of this layout what i
06:12 - want to be able to do is create a
06:13 - section here for the logo as well as the
06:17 - menu
06:18 - and what you'll do in wireframing
06:20 - usually is just create basic
06:22 - representations of these so in this case
06:25 - i'm just using a circle with the letter
06:27 - l there to represent where the logo will
06:30 - go and for the menu i'm just drawing out
06:32 - a number of boxes here with a shaded one
06:36 - representing the current one we're on
06:38 - and this will later be filled out with
06:40 - things like home about and other
06:41 - sections that we might have pages for
06:43 - but it gives us a quick representation
06:46 - of what the header will look like
06:48 - after we've finished designing the
06:50 - header we can start looking at creating
06:53 - the main hero image and the hero image
06:56 - these days are a big gigantic image that
06:58 - sort of runs behind the very front of
07:01 - the website as well as near the header
07:05 - and a lot of the cases these days you'll
07:07 - find that the menu actually sits on top
07:09 - of that header image well sometimes
07:11 - people like to place it in below
07:14 - and a lot of these headers as well
07:16 - sometimes are sliders so what i'm going
07:18 - to do is in this example i'm going to
07:20 - draw an arrow to the left here and the
07:22 - right and i'm going to represent this
07:24 - with a number of dots as well as the
07:27 - text here to say that this will be a
07:28 - slider image and people will be able to
07:30 - slide between different options here
07:33 - now that we've done this top header
07:35 - section with our hero banner we can
07:37 - start moving on to the next section here
07:40 - on our home page
07:41 - and when we're designing a website
07:44 - usually the next thing that you want to
07:45 - be able to do is either a call to action
07:48 - or a bit of information about a website
07:52 - and this is really well represented with
07:54 - maybe an image a large title and some
07:57 - descriptions about what the website will
07:59 - be so what we're going to do is we're
08:01 - going to create a box here with a
08:03 - crosstalk to represent where we'll place
08:05 - an image and we're going to create a
08:07 - title section here which will have
08:09 - slightly larger fonts and a few lines to
08:12 - represent maybe some description or text
08:15 - will later fill in in this section
08:18 - now that we've got this section in and
08:19 - we're going to be creating more sections
08:21 - out it's good to be able to label our
08:23 - sections so that for anyone coming in
08:26 - from a third point of view they'll be
08:27 - able to know what each section is so
08:30 - what i'm going to do here is i'm going
08:31 - to create out labels for each one of
08:33 - these we'll have labels here for our
08:35 - menu for our hero banner and in this
08:38 - case for our about us section that way
08:41 - later when we need to reference it we
08:43 - can point it out and if someone is
08:45 - coming in they'll be able to identify it
08:47 - immediately
08:48 - now let's take a look at creating our
08:51 - next section over here and what i want
08:53 - to be able to do is usually i break them
08:56 - into line items because sometimes you'll
08:58 - be able to copy paste them across to
09:01 - other parts of the website and also
09:03 - really segregates them but in this case
09:06 - when you create the website later on
09:08 - with the ui and the u um ui design you
09:10 - might not need those section breaks but
09:12 - now we'll just create one more here and
09:15 - in this case i want to create a section
09:17 - break here for maybe something like
09:19 - testimonials or sponsors in this example
09:22 - for a wireframe we will have lots of
09:25 - sponsors to identify so i'm going to
09:27 - represent a nice big box here that's
09:29 - grayed out as a maybe h1 or h2 maybe
09:32 - even a h3 tag here that'll represent
09:35 - that as sponsors later on and i'm gonna
09:38 - draw a number of boxes because we'll
09:40 - have about 12 or so sponsors and each
09:42 - one of these will follow that similar
09:44 - column design that you would expect when
09:46 - you're doing bootstrap or you can fit
09:48 - about 12 columns in a single section and
09:51 - with this done we'll be able to fill out
09:54 - this section quite neatly and we'll be
09:55 - able to identify it as a sponsor section
09:59 - now this is really quick and simple and
10:01 - you can see that even the line isn't
10:04 - that accurate and this is more or less
10:07 - done in just a few seconds the goal
10:09 - isn't here to have a perfect ui with
10:12 - perfect box shadows and backgrounds and
10:14 - colors it's really just to give a
10:16 - representation of how you plan the
10:18 - workflow of the website to be when
10:21 - you've got that workflow down you can
10:23 - move sections around you can move maybe
10:25 - the sponsor section up or down or to a
10:28 - different page entirely but the plan
10:30 - here is to give a representation of that
10:32 - section
10:33 - later if the client come back comes back
10:36 - and they only want three sponsors or two
10:38 - sponsors you can simply update the
10:40 - layout and maybe provide something
10:42 - different in that case the other thing
10:44 - i'm going to do in here is i'm going to
10:46 - add a button here to our about us
10:48 - section and this will simply be so that
10:51 - there is a small call to action there
10:53 - that if someone wants to learn more
10:55 - information about that about a section
10:57 - they can go to there
10:58 - let's take a look at creating a third
11:01 - section here
11:02 - this next section will be our footer
11:05 - section where we'll finish up the
11:07 - website design at least here on the home
11:09 - page and when you're doing the wireframe
11:12 - for a footer there's usually a few
11:14 - things you want to make sure that you
11:16 - add in there i think that having the
11:18 - logo reset and placed in there again
11:21 - sometimes in a reverse color is a good
11:24 - idea as well as maybe having a contact
11:26 - form and a site map so the first thing
11:28 - here i'm going to do is i'm going to
11:30 - create a small contact form which will
11:32 - have a shaded out title with some inputs
11:35 - and a button to submit
11:37 - since we want to show that this footer
11:39 - will have a darker color what i want to
11:41 - be able to do is show this visually so
11:44 - i'm going to draw a few lines here to
11:46 - represent that this might have a
11:48 - different shade or maybe it'll have a
11:50 - dark theme or something different in
11:52 - general just so that the footer stands
11:54 - out on each one of the pages
11:56 - once we've done that the next section
11:58 - here i'm going to create will actually
12:00 - be the site map now we don't have to
12:02 - give the actual pages in here i'm just
12:04 - going to draw lines to represent all the
12:06 - pages we might want to represent and
12:08 - sometimes you might want to limit down
12:10 - your site map just to the core essential
12:12 - pages but this is just a representation
12:14 - that will be having that in there and
12:17 - finally what i like to do is display the
12:19 - logo here last and the logo will also
12:23 - have a bit of information underneath and
12:25 - usually the last bit of information i
12:27 - like to include is maybe the phone
12:29 - number as well as the email address so
12:32 - that if someone's looking to contact
12:34 - their website service or product
12:36 - directly they'll be able to do that
12:37 - immediately sometimes it's good to have
12:40 - this on the header as well but at least
12:42 - this finishes up our footer section and
12:45 - this means that most of our home page
12:47 - here is now done and as you can see
12:50 - we've got our slider image about us
12:52 - section some sponsors and a simple
12:54 - footer
12:55 - i know that some people like to keep
12:58 - pages for the home page just a single
13:00 - maybe height and width where you might
13:02 - not even have any scrolling whereas
13:04 - other people might have parallax
13:06 - scrolling that might go and reach 20
13:09 - screens in height but sometimes that's
13:11 - too much so you have to make sure you
13:13 - balance it out
13:14 - now since we're doing wireframing one of
13:17 - the important things i think is
13:19 - worthwhile doing is labeling most of the
13:21 - content the content we're working with
13:24 - this labeling is not really for us but
13:26 - it's more for the people viewing this
13:28 - who might not be web developers so what
13:30 - i'm going to do is i'm going to select a
13:32 - different color here in our tools and
13:34 - i'm going to basically start drawing out
13:37 - arrows to represent what some of the
13:39 - items here are
13:41 - and this will just be visually really
13:43 - simple sometimes you can do this on a
13:45 - separate layer so you can hide it later
13:47 - but i usually like to make it clear and
13:49 - defined so that if there are any
13:51 - questions then they'll be immediately
13:53 - answered by this labeling so here i'm
13:55 - going to label that the contact us form
13:58 - the footer as well as the business
13:59 - contact information and i'll work my way
14:02 - up so that if there are any other things
14:04 - that might be worth representing like
14:06 - the phone number and the email address
14:08 - they'll be really obvious and they'll
14:10 - stand out
14:12 - the other thing i like to do is maybe go
14:14 - through some of the other sections here
14:16 - as well if we're going to do good
14:19 - labeling we need to make sure that we
14:20 - represent what some of these section
14:23 - legends essentially are so in this case
14:26 - like the darker block here will be a
14:28 - title whereas these small boxes will be
14:30 - logos of the sponsors themselves and
14:33 - this just makes it a little bit easier
14:35 - to read
14:36 - let's go through our design here and
14:38 - clearly define each one of these so in
14:41 - this example this will be an intro title
14:44 - and we're going to have some
14:45 - introduction text here as well to
14:48 - represent what this information is
14:51 - finally let's go through and label this
14:53 - last image here on our left and what i
14:56 - want to be able to do is just show
14:57 - clearly that this will be an image that
14:59 - will represent the business or the
15:01 - information about the business in a
15:03 - particular way images are hard things
15:05 - sometimes people really want to have the
15:08 - ability to change an image to fit what
15:11 - information it's matching and sometimes
15:13 - they don't even have that so they use
15:14 - stock photography and during wireframing
15:17 - it's really not important which image
15:19 - you select it's more about labeling what
15:22 - you'll be doing and where it'll be laid
15:24 - out and later on when the client figures
15:26 - out what they want to do with all the
15:27 - imaging that's when you can do all of
15:28 - that
15:29 - finally let's quickly mock up our slider
15:32 - image in here and just say that there'll
15:34 - be multiple slides here so we'll need
15:36 - multiple images to display this home
15:38 - page and that finalizes most of our home
15:41 - page here and now that we're done with
15:43 - that i think we can move on to our next
15:45 - section when creating websites we do
15:49 - have a number of different page layouts
15:52 - and usually what we have is we have a
15:54 - internal page maybe a blog page a
15:57 - contact us page and a features page and
16:01 - each one of these will have slightly
16:02 - different layouts and in this case one
16:05 - of the difficult layouts to do is
16:07 - actually the features page this is the
16:09 - page that really has to promote your
16:12 - product or your website so what we
16:14 - usually like to do is we like to make it
16:16 - a little bit more interesting with more
16:18 - photos and text and call to actions to
16:21 - really engage the customer or the user
16:23 - of the website
16:25 - what i'm going to do to create this page
16:27 - is i'm going to copy over the header
16:29 - section we want to keep a consistent
16:32 - header throughout all our web pages so
16:34 - in most cases i will be copying this
16:36 - across what's going to be different
16:38 - about this page is that we're not going
16:40 - to have that very large slider that we
16:42 - had on the home page
16:44 - instead we're going to have a title
16:46 - section here and i'm going to define
16:48 - this by creating a separate section in
16:50 - here and labeling it with the page title
16:53 - with a darker shade there to represent
16:55 - that h1 element
16:57 - this will later on be themed based on
17:00 - the colors that people might want to use
17:01 - for the features page but for the time
17:03 - being we'll just keep it black and white
17:05 - just so that we know that the title will
17:07 - be in there
17:08 - for the features page when we're
17:10 - creating different sections we need to
17:12 - really visually represent those in this
17:15 - case i want to represent the features
17:17 - page with a number of large images and
17:20 - large blocks of text to really show off
17:23 - what this product or service will be
17:25 - defining so what i'm going to do is i'm
17:27 - going to have a large square box here
17:29 - which will represent the image as well
17:31 - as a large title and a description
17:34 - and this will be our very first service
17:36 - in here in this case sometimes services
17:39 - have some bullet points to show off what
17:41 - they do so i'm going to create some
17:43 - bullet points in here and each one of
17:45 - those bullet points might have a tiny
17:46 - little icon or image as well
17:49 - and this creates our very first section
17:52 - here for a feature image but what's
17:54 - really cool now is that we can reuse
17:56 - this to create the next section for our
17:58 - next feature so what i'm going to do is
18:00 - i'm actually going to just copy over the
18:02 - layout that i previously used for the
18:04 - very first feature and i'm going to copy
18:06 - over the image as well and in this case
18:09 - i'm going to reuse them but slightly
18:11 - different i'm going to actually place
18:12 - them on opposite sides this will make
18:15 - the page just a little bit more
18:17 - interesting without actually trying to
18:19 - redefine it and it keeps things
18:21 - consistent as well
18:23 - now if we have a number of services we
18:25 - can actually just copy page copy paste
18:29 - each section down below once we've done
18:32 - this we'll have a very simple
18:34 - representation so that the user will
18:37 - understand what's going on on this page
18:39 - let's label this though for someone who
18:42 - might be viewing this wireframe we'll
18:45 - show off that this will be feature 1
18:47 - feature 2 and feature 3.
18:50 - and later on we can find images and text
18:52 - to do this but for the time being this
18:55 - gives us a clear indication of what the
18:58 - features page will look like
19:00 - the only thing that this page is now
19:02 - missing is the footer but we can copy
19:06 - that across really easily so what i'm
19:08 - gonna do is i'm actually just going to
19:10 - grab the footer here from our home page
19:13 - and we're going to copy that across
19:15 - straight across to our
19:18 - new features page and we'll be able to
19:20 - copy this across to all the other pages
19:22 - that we make
19:23 - we might not need some of that
19:25 - additional markup that we created there
19:27 - on the home page because it's a little
19:29 - bit redundant but what we can do and i
19:32 - can see that is missing is maybe a
19:35 - copyright section because whenever you
19:37 - do have a footer you do usually have all
19:39 - that information in there but usually
19:41 - also have a really small section there
19:43 - for a copyright so let's actually create
19:46 - that and that'll be just something
19:48 - really small on f1 size which is usually
19:50 - just a bit smaller than what the default
19:53 - font size is on a website
19:55 - and we'll just represent that with a
19:56 - single line but we'll mark it up to say
19:59 - that this will be the copyright section
20:02 - and let's also copy that across to our
20:05 - features page just so that it's
20:07 - consistent all the way throughout
20:10 - you'll find that when you're doing
20:11 - wireframes you can just do this in a few
20:14 - seconds and later when you're doing the
20:16 - actual layout and ui maybe in adobe xd
20:19 - or figma you can create out different
20:22 - section components which you'll really
20:24 - easily be able to add to other pages but
20:26 - in this case we'll just do it quickly
20:28 - and manually
20:29 - our features page and home page are now
20:31 - done but right now we don't know how we
20:34 - get from one page to another page so
20:37 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
20:38 - just draw out some really large lines
20:40 - here to show how you navigate from one
20:43 - page to another the first will be here
20:45 - in our header where we'll design a line
20:47 - to show that one of the header items
20:49 - will take us to the features page
20:51 - and the other will be just in the about
20:53 - us section where when we select the
20:55 - button it'll also take us to the
20:57 - features page
20:59 - now that we've represented
21:00 - now that we've represented the
21:02 - navigation here on our wireframing we
21:04 - can move on to the next page the next
21:07 - page i want to create here is our about
21:10 - us page
21:11 - and actually
21:13 - maybe no maybe let's try a different
21:15 - page let's try doing a contact us page
21:18 - this one is actually underrated but it's
21:21 - one of my favorite pages i know that
21:23 - whenever i'm visiting a website or a
21:25 - service and i want to get in contact
21:28 - with them especially if they're a local
21:29 - near my area the contact us page is
21:32 - probably one of the very first ones i go
21:34 - to because i just want to give them a
21:35 - call or an email
21:36 - so in order to create this let's just
21:39 - simply copy out our header here again
21:42 - the contact us page has usually a number
21:44 - of elements so the header and the footer
21:47 - are the first to most basic ones and
21:48 - since we've designed those already i
21:50 - usually just copy them across for each
21:52 - page i do
21:53 - the other x the other aspects are the
21:56 - contact us page i usually like to add in
21:59 - are the
22:00 - the phone number the email maybe a form
22:04 - to represent maybe a contact form that
22:06 - you might want to simply fill out as
22:07 - well as a map i think a map is important
22:10 - especially if your business is local or
22:12 - your website is doing a local service
22:15 - and people need to be able to get to it
22:17 - so let's copy out a small section here
22:19 - for our title like we've done similar to
22:21 - the features page again so that it's all
22:24 - consistent and then let's create some of
22:28 - those other elements so in this case
22:30 - let's create out a representation for
22:34 - the map in this case i'm just going to
22:36 - do it similar to what i did with the
22:38 - images on the home page in the features
22:40 - page where it's just a large box we do
22:43 - know google maps usually has a little
22:45 - box at the top left to represent the
22:47 - address but this should visualize that
22:49 - and we should be able to add some markup
22:51 - here as well to let people know that
22:54 - this will be a google map that they'll
22:55 - be able to actually click to and get
22:57 - directions straight to this business
23:01 - next up let's create this section here
23:03 - for maybe the contact us information so
23:07 - in this case i'm going to do a small
23:08 - little icon here and maybe this will be
23:10 - like a font awesome little phone or
23:12 - something like that with the phone
23:14 - number here and maybe we'll use another
23:17 - one just like this with maybe an
23:19 - envelope to represent the email address
23:22 - which we can add in the line below with
23:24 - these two being the most important we
23:26 - usually always add them at the very top
23:28 - and straight after that some people just
23:30 - like to send a message through a simple
23:33 - contact us form now in this case we
23:35 - already have a contact us form here on
23:38 - the footer so sometimes when you don't
23:40 - have those in the footer you can add
23:43 - them here to the contact us page but in
23:45 - this case since we already have one i
23:48 - think it might be a little bit redundant
23:49 - to add another one but what i might do
23:51 - is just add one in visually as a
23:53 - representation of what it should look
23:55 - like if we didn't have one in the footer
23:58 - and in this case it'll just be a few
24:00 - checkboxes with maybe a larger one here
24:02 - which might be a text area where people
24:04 - can fill it out with a slightly darker
24:07 - call to action button which will be the
24:09 - contact form submit button and this
24:11 - should finalize our contact us page as
24:14 - you can see it's a lot smaller than our
24:16 - home page and our feature page but it's
24:19 - because it's straight to the point it
24:20 - gives the information that we're trying
24:22 - to provide here straight away
24:24 - and in this case let's do some
24:26 - navigation to show how we'll get to that
24:29 - contact us page and in this case it'll
24:31 - just be selecting the menu at the top
24:33 - right to make sure that we're browsing
24:35 - straight there
24:36 - usually sometimes you also might have a
24:39 - contact us page somewhere near the
24:40 - footer but we'll keep it nice and simple
24:43 - in this case
24:44 - now that we have our home page and our
24:47 - features page and our contact us page
24:49 - done i think this is more or less most
24:52 - of our content done in general
24:54 - what we could do is we could lay out
24:57 - some of our components here just so it
24:59 - looks visually a little bit better
25:01 - if you're doing out wireframes usually
25:04 - you'll want to do quite a few pages you
25:07 - want to do internal pages category pages
25:09 - maybe product pages and lots more
25:13 - and the other thing you'll want to do is
25:14 - you want to make sure that you also
25:16 - create ones which might be responsive
25:18 - this means that you might want to create
25:20 - one ready for a tablet or a mobile phone
25:22 - let's take a look at how we can quickly
25:24 - do an example of a mobile responsive
25:27 - design for the home page because i think
25:29 - that would be useful just so that the
25:31 - user or the person viewing this
25:33 - wireframe gets a better representation
25:35 - of how the design adapts when you go
25:38 - down to a scroll smaller screen size so
25:40 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to put
25:41 - in a label here for mobile version
25:44 - and what i want to be able to do is
25:46 - create slightly smaller
25:50 - a slightly smaller width it'll be what
25:53 - you would expect for a mobile phone so
25:55 - it'll probably be a lot longer than the
25:58 - actual home page
26:00 - and we'll probably have to add slightly
26:02 - different elements in this case the very
26:04 - first element that we want to do when
26:06 - we're doing a mobile responsive design
26:08 - is a button for the menu and a second
26:11 - button for an interaction usually to
26:14 - call the service or business or maybe to
26:17 - email them or something like that
26:19 - we'll add the logo in the middle here
26:20 - because it'll probably be very small
26:23 - we'll have to make sure it has enough
26:24 - room
26:25 - and we'll still draw that little square
26:27 - in the background to represent the
26:29 - slider image which will be a lot smaller
26:32 - sometimes you don't even have sliders on
26:34 - the mobile version and you just have a
26:36 - single image let's put some markup here
26:38 - to represent what each one of these
26:41 - items are and in this case it'll just be
26:44 - the mobile button which will expand out
26:47 - the mobile menu as well as the phone
26:49 - number or mobile number depending on
26:51 - what it is let's draw out an l just
26:54 - there to represent the logo and have a
26:57 - look at creating our next section here
26:59 - our next section was an intro section
27:02 - which had an image it had a title a
27:04 - description and a button
27:06 - now since we don't have that same wide
27:09 - angle that we do on a desktop we really
27:11 - have to collapse this down to a single
27:13 - column and row and in this case what
27:16 - we're going to do is we're going to
27:17 - rearrange some of the content so it
27:19 - makes a bit more sense sometimes people
27:21 - put the image first but there's no
27:23 - context to that so what you want to do
27:26 - in this case is put the title with a
27:28 - description in first and then the image
27:30 - can follow this
27:32 - these will all be collapsed down to a
27:34 - single column so that they fit in nicely
27:37 - and they'll flow on based on the
27:39 - information that they provide
27:41 - let's actually copy out an arrow to show
27:44 - that this is the responsive version of
27:46 - this same content when we go to a
27:48 - responsive version we usually make the
27:50 - margins from the top to the bottom a bit
27:52 - smaller as well as the font size and the
27:54 - image is a bit smaller so as you can see
27:56 - this section is almost the same size as
27:59 - the previous section but obviously this
28:01 - might work differently in practice it
28:03 - depends on how you're arranging the
28:05 - content
28:06 - the next section here was the sponsor
28:08 - section and when we're collapsing down
28:10 - this section since the sponsors already
28:13 - are quite small we'll actually be able
28:15 - to fit about two in on the mobile design
28:18 - if you were to go up to a larger size
28:21 - maybe a tablet view or something like
28:22 - that maybe you could even expand them
28:24 - out to four or six items per row but in
28:27 - this case we'll just stick it in with
28:29 - two items or in this case maybe three
28:32 - items i don't know three looks like it's
28:34 - just barring the edge of what's possible
28:37 - but at least it doesn't make this
28:39 - section too large finally let's take a
28:42 - look at the last section here which is
28:44 - the footer and for the footer yes the
28:47 - contact us form is a little bit in the
28:49 - way so let's move that out of the way
28:51 - and let's create out this footer now
28:54 - since this footer actually does have
28:56 - quite a lot of content it's probably
28:58 - going to take up a lot more space
29:01 - the very first thing here we'll want to
29:03 - add in is our contact us form so let's
29:06 - represent that with a title a few inputs
29:09 - a text box and a button and after we
29:12 - create this we can move on to the site
29:15 - map and this will be the next main
29:18 - column here that we want to provide and
29:20 - this column will again have more or less
29:23 - the same information we could even copy
29:26 - paste it across and sometimes you might
29:29 - not even want to have so many items you
29:31 - might hide out one of the columns if you
29:33 - don't want to use them but in this case
29:35 - i do want to use them so i'm just going
29:37 - to create this next section here as a
29:40 - site map
29:41 - so let's put in a header section here to
29:44 - represent that and let's put in a few
29:46 - lines here to represent the menu items
29:48 - for that site map
29:50 - and finally let's create our last
29:52 - section here which will be for the logo
29:55 - and the contact information so in this
29:58 - case since we're on the mobile design we
30:00 - could make the logo here for this footer
30:03 - section
30:04 - full width or we could make it half
30:06 - width and we can create icons here for
30:09 - the phone number in the email
30:11 - and that finalizes our mobile design
30:14 - we now have our home page with a mobile
30:16 - version our features page and our
30:17 - contact us page and these are the basic
30:20 - building blocks to create out the rest
30:23 - of the website
30:25 - what i'm gonna do is put a copy of this
30:28 - wireframe as an svg in the description
30:31 - of this video so you guys can check it
30:33 - out i've done lots of wireframes in the
30:35 - past sometimes i just simply use a piece
30:38 - of paper and pen to create them whereas
30:40 - other times i might create something in
30:42 - figma or a third-party tool but the goal
30:45 - here isn't to essentially use a certain
30:48 - tool to do it it's more about creating a
30:50 - simple view for yourself and the client
30:53 - to present as a plan of what you're
30:55 - building for your next website or
30:57 - application
31:02 - we're going to be looking at creating
31:03 - the ui for these wireframes i want to
31:06 - design something which looks a little
31:08 - bit better is more professional and it's
31:10 - a closer step towards building out a
31:13 - full website design
31:15 - in this stage we're going to create the
31:16 - prototype ui
31:18 - for this wireframe it's not going to
31:20 - involve any colors or images or content
31:23 - it'll more be a version or a next
31:25 - iteration of that wireframe where we're
31:28 - creating it in a design tool like adobe
31:30 - xd or in this case figma i'm going to
31:33 - take you through the whole process of
31:34 - designing this and if you haven't heard
31:36 - of me before i'm adrian from australia i
31:39 - do videos around design and development
31:41 - and you can check out my channel in the
31:42 - description below but without further
31:44 - ado let's just jump straight into it to
31:47 - create our website design we're going to
31:50 - use a design tool called figma and this
31:53 - is very similar to sketch or adobe xd if
31:56 - you've used those in the past it allows
31:59 - you to create a mock-up of the website
32:01 - design on an artboard which actually
32:04 - exists in your web browser so you can
32:06 - use this on windows or mac or anything
32:08 - in general and you can edit this in real
32:11 - time and even collaborate with other
32:12 - people and if you want to sign up it's
32:15 - also free you don't have to pay anything
32:17 - we're going to sign up here with our
32:19 - google account and we're going to create
32:21 - a new board to start our ui design once
32:24 - you've logged in you want to go up here
32:26 - to drafts and hit the little plus sign
32:30 - and this will create a brand new figma
32:32 - file
32:33 - in this case we're going to give it a
32:35 - name so up here where it says untitled
32:37 - we'll call this maybe free
32:40 - code camp website
32:42 - ui and we can start coding this up but
32:46 - we don't need any code we can just use
32:48 - design to do this let's take a look at
32:51 - the different tools that figma provides
32:53 - for us at the top here we've got the
32:55 - selector tool which will be able to move
32:57 - different shapes and items we also have
33:00 - a scaling tool
33:02 - over here we have a frame and the frame
33:04 - is used to create new frames or canvases
33:07 - to create our designs on
33:09 - over here we've got our shapes so these
33:11 - are things like squares and circles and
33:13 - lines and other objects that we might
33:16 - want to do such as images and finally
33:18 - here we've got our custom shapes text
33:20 - and moving the artboard around finally
33:24 - over here we've got our comment section
33:26 - but we're not gonna really use this this
33:28 - is more if you have a group of people
33:30 - and you need to leave markup and notes
33:33 - for others to review for your design
33:36 - let's start off here by selecting the
33:38 - frame tool and on the far right here
33:40 - we've got a number of options we've got
33:42 - designs here for maybe phones or tablets
33:45 - or even desktop if you're doing a design
33:47 - for maybe something like a piece of
33:49 - paper you can do that too in our example
33:52 - we're just going to grab the desktop
33:54 - size over here to design our canvas i'm
33:57 - going to make a small revision to this
33:59 - however for the width here i'm going to
34:01 - do this to 1980 because this is the
34:04 - normal monitor width that you ex
34:06 - essentially usually use when you're
34:08 - doing a website design and the other
34:10 - thing here is the height i'm going to
34:12 - also make this 1980 and we might also
34:15 - increase this a little bit as we work
34:17 - through it but this gives us our first
34:19 - frame that we can work on and this will
34:21 - be the home page so over here you can
34:23 - see a desktop desk 1. we're going to
34:26 - rename this and we're going to call this
34:27 - home page and this will be our first
34:30 - canvas we can work on
34:32 - now we've got our design that we did
34:34 - before on the ipad when we did the
34:37 - wireframe and what we want to be able to
34:39 - do is replicate that same design in a
34:41 - better sort of mock-up here for this ui
34:44 - design so i'm going to take you through
34:46 - that but before we get started let's
34:48 - open up and have a look at that
34:49 - wireframe to see what we need to build
34:51 - out what's really cool about figma is
34:54 - that we can literally copy paste content
34:56 - straight in there from our computers we
34:58 - can even drag and drop it so here i have
35:00 - the previous wireframe we did and i'm
35:03 - going to copy paste this just here to
35:05 - the left that we can use as a reference
35:08 - and we can see here we build out a home
35:10 - page a features page a contact page and
35:12 - a mobile version if you haven't seen
35:14 - that video i'll link it in the
35:16 - description below but what we're going
35:18 - to do is we're just going to use the
35:20 - home page here as reference and i've got
35:23 - a separate svg just for that which we're
35:25 - going to copy out here to the right
35:28 - and using this reference we'll start
35:29 - building out a ui against this so that
35:32 - we can create something which is
35:33 - visually just a little bit better and
35:35 - more professional as well that we can
35:37 - show off to our client as the second
35:39 - iteration of our design
35:41 - let's begin by dragging our actual svg
35:44 - here into our page
35:47 - and what i want to be able to do is
35:49 - create out each one of these sections
35:52 - but before we do this normally when
35:54 - you're creating a website then you're
35:56 - using a framework for the layout maybe
35:59 - something like bootstrap with rows and
36:01 - columns so let's create a little bit of
36:04 - a grid layout here there's an option
36:06 - here on the far right called grid layout
36:08 - and i'm just going to select one in here
36:11 - it does a default 10 pixel by 10 pixel
36:13 - grid but we want to customize it to be
36:16 - our own so in this case i'm going to
36:18 - select columns and fold columns i'm
36:20 - going to do 12 because that's what
36:23 - normal bootstrap uses
36:25 - of course the width for this is a little
36:27 - bit too much so i'm going to reduce it
36:29 - down and we're going to select a gutter
36:31 - of 15 pixels and maybe a width of about
36:35 - 80 or 90 here just to represent our
36:38 - columns of course this can change
36:40 - depending on what you're using but this
36:41 - should just get us started the next
36:44 - thing we'll want to do is create here
36:46 - our section for the slider image and i'm
36:50 - going to select the box tool here at the
36:52 - very top left and we're going to drag
36:54 - and
36:55 - pull down to the bottom right here a
36:57 - nice big box
36:59 - this is a little bit too big right now
37:00 - so i'm going to reduce this down to
37:02 - maybe 800 pixels
37:04 - and we're also going to give it a
37:06 - slightly lighter tint so here in the far
37:09 - right in the fill section we're going to
37:11 - change the c4c4 hex color to just eee
37:16 - and that should be a lot more visible
37:18 - now
37:19 - the next thing i want to be able to do
37:20 - is have a look at creating a menu
37:23 - and to do this we select this box tool
37:27 - once more and we're just going to drag
37:29 - it and follow our columns here we might
37:32 - not use all the columns we might just
37:34 - use most of them here and we'll give
37:36 - this maybe a height of about 60 pixels
37:39 - so let's update this here on the far
37:41 - right
37:42 - the next thing we're going to do is
37:43 - select the box tool but drop it down and
37:46 - select a circle and for this circle this
37:48 - will be the logo so i'm just going to
37:50 - pull it in here from the top left
37:52 - and this might just pop in here as two
37:56 - columns in width with one column here
37:58 - having a space between our menu and our
38:00 - logo
38:01 - and it'll be another circle in here so
38:04 - we can see that a lot better let's take
38:06 - out the grids here so we can see these
38:08 - items a little bit clearly
38:11 - here we go and we can see we've got our
38:13 - logo and our menu placeholders there
38:16 - for our logo i'm going to select the
38:19 - text tool here and i'm going to type in
38:21 - logo just anywhere here on the page
38:24 - when we zoom in now to maybe say 75
38:28 - let's just do that here at the top right
38:31 - and have a look we can pull this
38:33 - straight here towards our logo and our
38:36 - circle and we'll make this a little bit
38:38 - bigger i'm going to make it 24 pixels
38:40 - maybe even 48 pixels and i'm just gonna
38:44 - put this right on top of the circle
38:46 - i'm gonna give it a slightly lighter
38:48 - shade so maybe something like 999
38:52 - and it'll just go over here we can add
38:54 - it in later
38:55 - the other thing i'm going to do is i'm
38:57 - going to group these two items right now
38:59 - this is just called an ellipse and a
39:01 - logo for text but i'm going to select
39:03 - both of them and hit ctrl g and this
39:06 - will now be a group and for this group
39:08 - i'm going to label it logo just so that
39:10 - we can be able to use this later on if
39:12 - we do we can always expand it out here
39:14 - on the left or double click on it to
39:16 - access the items inside
39:19 - now for the menu i want to be able to do
39:21 - the same thing so what i'm going to do
39:23 - is grab the text item here and i'm going
39:26 - to put in a few different pages since we
39:30 - know which pages we want to use it'll be
39:32 - pretty easy we've got the home page
39:35 - which we've already built
39:36 - we'll have an about us page
39:38 - we'll also have a features page and
39:42 - maybe we'll have a contact us page
39:46 - let's create one more item in here
39:49 - and normally the final item we might
39:51 - have is something like pricing or maybe
39:54 - purchase and this is usually on most
39:57 - websites just so that it takes us to
39:59 - where we need to go
40:00 - now that we have all the menus done all
40:04 - we need to do is space them out equally
40:06 - because right now they sort of don't
40:09 - have the correct amount of spacing
40:11 - there's a few ways we can do this we can
40:13 - pull one of the items from the very
40:15 - left here and we can do one two three
40:18 - four which is 40 pixels from the left
40:20 - then we can apply the same to the
40:23 - boundary so we'll do one two three four
40:25 - here
40:26 - but since this is padding from the left
40:28 - here we'll do another one two three four
40:30 - so that should be about 80 pixels then
40:33 - when we do the next unit over here we
40:35 - should be able to apply the same amount
40:37 - of padding figma actually has some tools
40:40 - here that automatically tell you how
40:43 - much padding is applied so here we had
40:45 - 82 so i'm just going to reduce that by 2
40:47 - pixels for both of these
40:50 - and that should be just about right so
40:52 - if we have a look now it's 80 and 80.
40:55 - let's move this down as well so it's on
40:57 - the same line height and we can then
41:00 - browse over here to the purchase one
41:02 - also put in 80 pixels so here is 80
41:06 - here let's double check that's 80 as
41:08 - well it doesn't seem to be 80. let's
41:11 - have a look 79
41:14 - 80 80 and this one over here will be 80
41:18 - as well
41:19 - then we can move this menu in just a
41:22 - little bit so this should be about 80
41:24 - pixels as well from the far right and
41:26 - finally we want to highlight our active
41:29 - item which is the home page so i'm going
41:31 - to copy over this box and i'm just going
41:33 - to create another one on top here and
41:35 - this one will have a darker shade so
41:37 - maybe something like 666
41:40 - and we're going to invert the color here
41:43 - for the home so that'll be white on dark
41:46 - gray
41:47 - now with that done we have our menu more
41:49 - or less complete we can reduce the
41:52 - height a little bit so instead of 80 we
41:54 - could push it down to maybe 60. let's
41:57 - actually move it down just a tad here we
42:00 - can see that it's fitting in quite
42:01 - nicely there
42:03 - the next thing we can do is have a look
42:05 - at creating our slider here because
42:07 - right now it doesn't look like much of a
42:08 - slider so in order to do that what i'm
42:11 - thinking is maybe create a couple of
42:14 - those arrows here on the left and the
42:16 - right now there's a few different ways
42:18 - we can do this we could go to font
42:20 - awesome for example we go chevron left
42:23 - here
42:24 - and this is a icon here we can use from
42:27 - font awesome we can actually download
42:29 - the svg in here when we do we can
42:32 - literally drag and drop it straight into
42:34 - our design over here right now it's a
42:37 - little bit too big so i'm going to
42:38 - resize it down just a tad maybe down to
42:41 - about say let's see we'll lock in the
42:44 - resizing tool here and i think for the
42:47 - width i'm going to do 40 pixels and the
42:49 - height can stay at 64. and that's just
42:52 - about right and we're just going to
42:53 - center this here to our slider
42:57 - we'll also give it about a 40 units
42:59 - there from the left
43:00 - and we'll also reduce its color so here
43:03 - on the right i'm going to give it a 50
43:05 - opacity just so that it's not fully
43:08 - black we could even reduce this down a
43:11 - little bit more maybe at 33 percent and
43:13 - that's just enough to give it a bit of a
43:15 - great tint but it'll also blend into the
43:17 - background later if we add an image in
43:19 - here we can copy over the same chevron
43:22 - and place one here to the far right
43:25 - i'll give this another 40 pixels and
43:27 - i'll also rotate it so it's pointing to
43:30 - the right side and finally we might add
43:33 - a few little dots here to the bottom of
43:35 - our slider which might be about 22
43:38 - pixels in width and height and we'll
43:40 - copy them over just so that they can
43:42 - represent the slides themselves and
43:45 - which one is the current active one so
43:48 - let's do that just over here and we can
43:51 - give them about 10 pixels of space in
43:54 - between
43:55 - and with that done i'll also color in
43:59 - the very primary one here with that dark
44:01 - gray tint
44:03 - so that's our slider done for our home
44:05 - page it's also our logo and our menu
44:07 - done
44:08 - and this looks pretty accurate comparing
44:11 - with our slider image the only other
44:13 - thing we could do in here is maybe some
44:15 - hero text so in here i'll just put in
44:18 - hero title and i'm going to give it a
44:20 - slightly larger font size maybe like 72
44:24 - pixels will be just about right and
44:25 - maybe a heavier weight at maybe bold
44:28 - hero title example can be our primary
44:32 - text here if we
44:34 - open up the the frame here with the
44:37 - columns and make that visible we can
44:39 - make sure it's aligned properly here to
44:40 - the left
44:42 - and i'm going to copy this over and make
44:44 - a smaller one here
44:46 - and this one i'll give it a regular
44:48 - weight and this can be a hero
44:51 - sub
44:53 - title
44:54 - description
44:56 - beautiful we'll also give this a
44:58 - slightly uh
45:01 - slight opacity at maybe 66
45:04 - and we can turn off the grids over here
45:08 - now so we can take a look at that
45:09 - and in terms of a slider this is pretty
45:11 - good i'm pretty happy with this hero
45:14 - banner slider and navigation we can take
45:16 - a look at creating the next section in
45:19 - our design here and the next section if
45:21 - we take a look at it it's actually doing
45:23 - the about us section where we've got an
45:25 - image on the left we've got a title a
45:27 - description and a button and this should
45:29 - be pretty easy to do using our column
45:32 - design so let me pull this in here to
45:34 - the right so we can start working on it
45:37 - so i'm going to copy over this entire
45:40 - section that we had here for our hero
45:43 - and create this one with a slightly
45:46 - lighter tint maybe something like f1 f1
45:49 - f1
45:50 - this way we can see that we do have a
45:52 - height to it but we're going to work
45:55 - within the bounds of that height just so
45:57 - that we don't make anything too large or
45:59 - too small but it's consistent with all
46:01 - the other sections
46:02 - what we want to be able to do is open up
46:05 - our rows here
46:06 - and for our rows i want to be able to
46:09 - see them
46:10 - and i want to work within the bounds of
46:12 - them
46:12 - and by rows i of course mean columns but
46:15 - you get the idea what we're going to do
46:18 - is we're going to create a square here
46:20 - to represent the image and this will
46:22 - span about four columns i'm just going
46:25 - to center this inside this section right
46:28 - over here
46:29 - and the next thing i'm going to do is
46:30 - create a description section where i'm
46:33 - copying out the hero description and
46:36 - pasting it just here on the right with
46:38 - maybe a one column gap
46:41 - i'm going to bump this height up a
46:43 - little bit so that it's got less margin
46:45 - between the title and the description
46:48 - and i'm also going to copy out this
46:50 - description create another one here
46:52 - which might be 24 pixels in width or
46:56 - font size anyway and we're gonna expand
46:58 - out this section let's jump in on the
47:01 - lorem ipsum website here and let's copy
47:04 - over our favorite bit of text we're
47:07 - going to paste it here in the
47:09 - description and anyone who wants to can
47:12 - edit this in the future but it gets our
47:14 - description up and running
47:16 - i don't want so much content so i'll
47:17 - remove some of it but below here if we
47:20 - take a look we are almost getting the
47:23 - design the same here as our wireframe
47:26 - what we need though is a button so i'm
47:28 - going to copy over this image i'm going
47:30 - to pull it here over to the right
47:32 - and i'm going to give it a height of
47:34 - about the same as the menu which was 60.
47:37 - we're gonna reduce the width a little
47:39 - bit here and we're going to add some
47:41 - text here to put on top of the button
47:44 - here we go
47:46 - and in this case i'm going to do
47:48 - something like read more this is pretty
47:50 - standard the only other thing i might do
47:52 - here is bump up the text just a little
47:54 - bit to maybe
47:57 - 28 28 does just about right
48:00 - let's resize the text sizing
48:03 - box over here and let's also center this
48:06 - read more section
48:08 - this button here i feel like it'll do a
48:10 - lot better if it's a darker shade so i'm
48:12 - going to make it a 666 with the color
48:15 - for the readme being a white color and
48:18 - that way you can stand out just a little
48:20 - bit more so that way we've got this
48:22 - section done here and it's starting to
48:24 - look pretty good i'm pretty happy with
48:27 - it so far and i don't think we need
48:28 - anything else it gets us started for
48:31 - this introduction section
48:33 - i only think that the title here for the
48:35 - hero is a little bit too large because
48:37 - we've already used this large size on
48:39 - the hero image so what i'm going to do
48:41 - is i'm going to bump this down just one
48:44 - lot of units to maybe 64 pixels or maybe
48:47 - even 48 pixels
48:49 - 48 might be a little bit too
48:51 - low so i'm going to reduce it down to
48:53 - say
48:54 - 60 and this one over here maybe 236
48:58 - that way they don't look a little bit
49:00 - too overwhelming they still fit within
49:02 - the confines of this section but they
49:05 - don't overwhelm you similar to how the
49:07 - hero section is meant to be a lot larger
49:10 - now let's take a look at this section
49:13 - without any grids implemented i'm gonna
49:17 - re turn them off over here
49:19 - and i'm also going to take off this gray
49:22 - color for the background of this section
49:24 - and we can see that it's looking pretty
49:27 - good if we take a look at our original
49:30 - version here we can see that we have
49:32 - quite a bit of padding here from the top
49:34 - to the bottom that's almost 200 pixels
49:37 - but we could reduce that in the future
49:39 - it's more about keeping this section
49:41 - similar
49:42 - i'm going to copy over this section but
49:45 - before i do uh we should really have a
49:48 - look at how we're doing the grouping on
49:50 - the left here because right now it's a
49:52 - big mess and we don't know what anything
49:54 - is so what i'm going to do is grab the
49:56 - common items in this section by shift
50:00 - selecting them
50:01 - and i'm going to group them with control
50:03 - g
50:04 - and in here i'm going to do about us
50:06 - section
50:08 - this will be a clear indication of what
50:09 - this section is because right now we're
50:12 - not too sure
50:13 - in here we can give some more labels as
50:15 - well
50:16 - so this might be the image
50:18 - over here for the readme i'm going to
50:20 - group that as well and we'll do this as
50:22 - read
50:23 - me button
50:25 - and then finally we've got one more
50:27 - rectangle here and we'll call this bg in
50:30 - case we do want to add a background
50:31 - later
50:32 - if you're feeling particularly
50:35 - ambitious you can also reorder these
50:37 - things so they make sense logically so
50:40 - for example the title might go first the
50:42 - description second the text and the
50:45 - button last with image here being first
50:48 - being on the left of these columns
50:51 - and that's our section done here the
50:53 - other thing we can do is actually lock
50:54 - it into place so that way we can't
50:56 - select it or move it about anymore
50:59 - this will be a good idea to do as well
51:01 - here for this main hero section so i'm
51:04 - going to grab a lot of these elements
51:06 - here so that we can group them all
51:08 - together
51:09 - that way they can exist as they need to
51:11 - so we'll call this hero section
51:14 - the other thing we have to do is the
51:16 - same here for the menu so i'm going to
51:18 - group these and call this menu and we'll
51:20 - pull this up above our hero section and
51:24 - we could even pull it inside the hero
51:26 - section but normally since we'll be
51:28 - using this menu outside for other pages
51:31 - it might be useful just to have it
51:32 - outside
51:33 - the same goes here for the logo so i'm
51:35 - going to pull that outside as well
51:37 - that covers most of our section here for
51:40 - the hero and for the about us section so
51:43 - let's actually lock these into place so
51:45 - we can begin working on the next section
51:47 - i'm also going to increase the height of
51:50 - the homepage here to 250
51:53 - or 2600 pixels
51:55 - and this will give us room to create the
51:58 - section here for the sponsors
52:00 - so what i'm going to do is copy our
52:03 - about us section and i'm gonna drag it
52:05 - in here below
52:07 - but i'm gonna make a few changes to it
52:10 - so over here if we have our button for
52:13 - readme i'm going to
52:15 - take that out
52:17 - the one here for the description i'm
52:19 - going to also remove that
52:21 - we'll only be left with the hero title
52:23 - and subtitle
52:24 - i'm also going to put this up all the
52:27 - way to the top of this section and i'm
52:29 - going to try and center these so that
52:32 - they exist right in the middle of our
52:34 - page if we move it across we should have
52:38 - figma essentially tell us by a red
52:40 - border when it's ready there
52:42 - finally i'm going to enable our columns
52:45 - here again so that we can see them
52:47 - and this image that we have here for our
52:50 - design we're going to shrink this down
52:52 - to be essentially two columns in width
52:55 - and we're going to copy this across so
52:57 - let's actually copy this in here and
53:00 - i'll keep copying this across until it
53:02 - spans all of our row here
53:06 - and these will be our sponsors now you
53:08 - can see that we've fit most of them in
53:11 - here
53:11 - and i think that's pretty good the only
53:13 - other thing i want to do with this
53:15 - section is possibly give it a slight
53:18 - background tin i'm going to grab the
53:20 - same tint we used here for our header
53:22 - but now that we have applied a bit of
53:24 - the tin we are going to have to expand
53:26 - it out just a little bit so that the
53:29 - title section there has the same sort of
53:32 - height as it does in the other section
53:34 - so i think that's about 200 pixels let's
53:37 - move all of these down
53:39 - and that's looking a little bit better
53:40 - there since this isn't a hero title
53:44 - example this is about
53:46 - us i'm going to rename all this rename
53:48 - this to about us example
53:51 - and about a subtitle
53:54 - for this section here i'm going to do
53:56 - this as the
53:57 - sponsors example
53:59 - and the sponsor's description
54:03 - let's center this and
54:05 - since this is a line left in terms of
54:07 - text there's a tool here that gets us to
54:10 - align at center so i'm going to apply
54:12 - this both to the title and the subtitle
54:15 - and i'm going to move them again into
54:16 - the center so that they're working
54:18 - properly and that should be just about
54:21 - there
54:22 - we also want this to have a little bit
54:25 - less padding from the bottom there so
54:27 - i'm thinking just about 200 pixels
54:34 - and that's just about right
54:36 - but it feels like it's too many pixels
54:39 - i'm gonna maybe make it only a hundred
54:41 - and that's about a hundred there
54:43 - so that's pretty good there for our
54:45 - sponsor section i'm just gonna move the
54:48 - images up just a tiny bit i'm gonna redo
54:51 - how centered this is so that it just
54:54 - does look centered so
54:56 - that's all done and we can move on to
54:59 - our final section which is actually our
55:02 - footer so we're almost done for this
55:04 - design and it's starting to come out
55:05 - pretty good
55:07 - let's remove the columns over here to
55:09 - have a look at the sponsors section
55:11 - and the thing about this is that if we
55:14 - take a look at the batter section it's
55:16 - got about 200 pixels of padding there
55:18 - from the bottom and the top but for this
55:22 - sponsor section it's only about 100
55:24 - pixels
55:25 - and this is because there's less content
55:27 - so it's got a bit less room to breathe
55:30 - there simply because it's not
55:32 - overwhelming with content the more
55:33 - content you normally put into a design
55:36 - the more padding you want to make sure
55:37 - that you're adding in so that everything
55:39 - stays consistent in here i just want to
55:42 - make sure it's just about 100 pixels so
55:44 - that's looking good
55:46 - now for the footer a footer design it
55:49 - normally has a much darker tint to it
55:52 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
55:53 - copy over this home box that we created
55:56 - earlier i'm going to use this as the
55:58 - baseline for our footer over here so
56:00 - let's actually cut and paste this in
56:02 - here below i'm also going to make it a
56:05 - little bit bigger here so i'm going to
56:07 - expand this out just here to the bottom
56:10 - and that should get our footer section
56:12 - ready now if we take a look here in our
56:15 - wireframe we're using a logo
56:17 - a contact form and a site map
56:20 - since we already have a logo here i'm
56:22 - gonna actually copy this across and
56:25 - we're gonna paste it here below we can
56:27 - see that that automatically looks okay
56:31 - the next thing i want to do is this
56:33 - rectangle i'm just going to group it in
56:34 - its own section here and i'll call this
56:37 - footer bg for the time being and the
56:40 - logo i'm just going to move in here and
56:41 - we're going to group this whole thing as
56:43 - footer
56:45 - for this section i want to open up the
56:48 - columns here again so we can see what
56:50 - we're working with
56:52 - and we want to design something around
56:54 - these columns so if we take a look at
56:57 - the actual svg here that we created
57:00 - before
57:01 - and how it's designed we can see that we
57:04 - have the three columns here
57:06 - so the first one will take up four
57:08 - columns
57:10 - the next one will take up another full
57:12 - column so let's let's do that over here
57:15 - i'm just going to
57:16 - block them out so i can see how much
57:19 - space they're taking up
57:21 - and there we go
57:23 - so those are the columns we'll be using
57:25 - so in here i want to put my first title
57:29 - so i'm just going to apply that possibly
57:32 - let's move the logo here to the left
57:34 - and let's put in these titles so for the
57:36 - title here i might copy over this large
57:39 - text that we use for our sponsors and
57:41 - just drag it in below we'll move it up
57:44 - here into the group but instead of being
57:46 - a black color i'm gonna make it a white
57:48 - color just so that we can see it
57:50 - properly so here i'm just gonna select
57:52 - white and for the description here i'm
57:55 - going to set that to white as well
57:57 - i'm going to pull this in over to the
57:59 - left so it's aligned left and i'm also
58:01 - going to give it some padding here from
58:03 - the top
58:05 - and this is about 10 pixels worth of
58:07 - padding and i think that sorry 100
58:09 - pixels worth of padding which i think
58:11 - should be just enough
58:13 - here i'm gonna write in contact us and
58:16 - let's just set this to be a line left
58:18 - and we'll move this back over here to
58:20 - the left and here i can write something
58:23 - like send us a message
58:26 - i'll also align this to the left here
58:28 - and we'll make sure that it just starts
58:30 - off here near the column
58:32 - so that's looking good the next part
58:34 - that i want to do is copying this over
58:37 - and creating a bit of a site map so here
58:40 - i'm just going to type in site map
58:43 - and
58:44 - all our pages
58:46 - and finally we've got our logo over here
58:49 - we do also want some contact information
58:51 - below our logo so i'm just going to copy
58:54 - over this subtitle text and in here
58:57 - we're going to put in a phone number in
58:59 - this case i'm just going to make one up
59:01 - but that should get us up and running
59:04 - the only other thing that we have in
59:06 - here is actually a little icon there for
59:09 - the phone so i'm going to jump into font
59:12 - awesome to get that
59:14 - over here i'm just going to type in
59:16 - phone on their website and it should pop
59:19 - up with a few icons here i'm just gonna
59:21 - grab the very first one to download and
59:23 - i'm gonna just drag and drop that in
59:26 - we'll set the color here to be white and
59:28 - i'm just gonna resize it down here to
59:30 - about 36 pixels
59:33 - and we'll just align that just to the
59:36 - left of our column here we can pull in
59:38 - the phone number just a bit and that
59:40 - looks good
59:41 - we can then copy this across and we can
59:44 - do another one here and the second one
59:46 - might be the email address so here i'll
59:48 - type in email at address.com
59:51 - and we can fill that in later but we'll
59:53 - probably want an icon for that too
59:56 - so over here let's do envelope and i'm
59:59 - going to probably select the very first
60:01 - one over here as well
60:03 - and i'll just click to download that one
60:05 - i'll see if i can drag and drop that in
60:08 - and that has not appeared at all i'm not
60:11 - sure what happened there but that's okay
60:13 - we'll just delete this phone over here
60:15 - and i'm gonna drag it in once more and
60:17 - i'm gonna set the height and width here
60:19 - to 36 pixels
60:22 - great we'll also change the color here
60:24 - to be white and i'll just drag that here
60:27 - next to the email so we've got the email
60:29 - and the phone now done
60:31 - let's do the contact us section now for
60:34 - this section we'll have some forms here
60:37 - so as a form input i'm going to actually
60:40 - create a box here and i might give it a
60:43 - white color
60:44 - this will represent the input and i'll
60:46 - just increase the height here to about
60:48 - 60 so it's consistent with the rest of
60:50 - our buttons and stuff
60:51 - and i'll also put a placeholder text in
60:54 - here for this maybe i'll write something
60:56 - like full name
60:58 - and we can make this a little bit
61:00 - smaller maybe 24 pixels
61:03 - and we'll also give it a slight shade so
61:07 - maybe a 50 opacity will apply then
61:10 - there is our first input i'm going to
61:13 - copy that across and create a second one
61:16 - here and for this second one i'll do
61:18 - your email
61:22 - and we'll maybe create one last one here
61:25 - and this last one we can actually give
61:26 - it one more column for the sizing here
61:29 - and a little bit more height maybe 120
61:31 - in this case
61:33 - and what this can be is our message
61:36 - so let's pass that in here
61:38 - finally we'll need a button people can
61:40 - click on so i'm gonna copy over this
61:43 - input one more time
61:45 - and this time we'll drag it here in
61:47 - below and i'm gonna reduce this width
61:50 - here to two columns and i'll type this
61:52 - in as maybe submit now we want this
61:55 - button to stand out a little bit we
61:57 - don't want it to be the same as our
61:58 - inputs so what i'm going to do is i'm
62:00 - going to give it a nice dark color
62:03 - not exactly black but like a dark gray
62:06 - which is a 333 in the hex colors and
62:08 - we'll change the font color here to be
62:10 - white at 100 opacity so that way we can
62:13 - see it standing out there
62:15 - so that's our contact form done that
62:17 - looks pretty good let's fill out our
62:19 - site map over here i'm going to copy the
62:22 - full name text over here and this can be
62:25 - used for our links i'm going to set this
62:27 - to a full white 100 opacity color
62:31 - and in here i'm just going to put in a
62:33 - couple of links this doesn't have to be
62:36 - anything special
62:37 - just copy out the same links that we had
62:40 - on our header here
62:42 - but uh what we can do is maybe we can
62:45 - play around with the sizing just a tad
62:47 - because it does feel like it's a little
62:49 - bit too small
62:50 - but once we do i can see that that's
62:53 - looking much better as we have more
62:54 - pages we could fill this out and we
62:56 - could even embed it indent it if we had
62:58 - sub pages but this is enough for our
63:01 - footer design here the only thing we're
63:03 - missing now is a copyright section so
63:06 - i'm going to actually create this at the
63:07 - very bottom here and i might give it a
63:10 - 100 pixels of height here
63:13 - and we'll give it a darker shade so what
63:15 - i'm thinking here is maybe the 333 color
63:18 - that we use for our submit button
63:21 - and let's copy over maybe our text here
63:24 - for our subtitle and place this above
63:27 - the element
63:29 - and what we want to do is just put in a
63:31 - generic copyright message in here so
63:33 - something like copyright 2020
63:37 - all
63:38 - rights reserved
63:40 - company
63:41 - name
63:42 - beautiful we can even put in a copyright
63:45 - icon for that but for now i'm not going
63:47 - to worry too much about it it's also a
63:49 - little bit too big copyrights are
63:50 - usually a lot smaller so i'm going to
63:52 - reduce this to 24 pixels
63:55 - and i'm also going to center the text
63:58 - and center the positioning here so that
64:00 - it's exactly in the middle of our page
64:03 - so that looks much better
64:05 - now with our footer done we're mostly
64:07 - done with our home page and this has
64:09 - actually turned out quite good
64:11 - we can have a look at all the elements
64:14 - here and what we can see is that in
64:16 - terms of the spacing the only
64:18 - issue i have here is maybe this about us
64:21 - section is just a little bit too big i'd
64:24 - like maybe for there to be about 100
64:27 - pixels from the top and the bottom
64:28 - because that 200 is almost too much so
64:31 - what i'm gonna do is actually move this
64:33 - section up a little bit and we'll make
64:35 - sure that it's a hundred pixels from the
64:37 - top
64:38 - one two three four five six seven eight
64:41 - nine ten
64:42 - and this square here i'm gonna resize it
64:44 - and just go one two three four five six
64:47 - seven eight nine ten beautiful
64:49 - and then we can move all the other
64:51 - elements up here so that is looking much
64:56 - better now let's just make sure we grab
64:57 - all of these and move them up
65:00 - so if we have a look now we have
65:02 - consistent spacing between each section
65:04 - we've got our header and footer and we
65:06 - just resize our
65:08 - our frame here a little bit just to cut
65:10 - out the bottom bit here
65:12 - now that we're finished with the home
65:15 - page let's take a look at our original
65:17 - wireframe and how it's been applied to
65:20 - our ui over here originally we had our
65:23 - slider image here and we've applied that
65:26 - with our logo and our menu here at the
65:28 - top and that's come across quite well we
65:30 - added some awesome icons here on the
65:32 - left and the right but we've also added
65:35 - in some text here and this is pretty
65:37 - important because a lot of the times
65:38 - when companies do have images they also
65:42 - want to carry across a statement and
65:44 - this will do that
65:46 - in terms of the next section here for
65:48 - about us we've followed the grid
65:50 - structure here of column design and
65:52 - we've made sure that everything is
65:53 - consistent so that later if you want to
65:55 - do a responsive design each one of these
65:57 - columns can break into a row
65:59 - and for the sponsors section we haven't
66:02 - added 12 sponsors in there we've just
66:04 - done six usually sponsor images are
66:06 - pretty big and if you have them really
66:08 - small you won't be able to see them
66:10 - properly this way by just having six
66:12 - right here they fit into that column
66:14 - design a lot more neatly and if we
66:16 - wanted to we could add more but they can
66:18 - also collapse down much easier too
66:20 - and finally we have our footer over here
66:22 - where we've had a contact us form a site
66:25 - map a logo and some contact information
66:28 - there's room here for growth as well if
66:30 - the site expands out further or at least
66:33 - these are the basics of what you would
66:35 - expect in a footer as well as our copy
66:37 - right there at the very bottom
66:42 - the design for any website or app is one
66:44 - of the most important steps before
66:46 - developing it we all know how hard it
66:48 - can be to change things down the track
66:50 - and this is why i always like to measure
66:52 - twice and cut once we've been looking at
66:54 - this series where we've been putting
66:56 - together a website design we've done the
66:59 - wireframe for it as well as a small ui
67:01 - prototype in this video we're going to
67:03 - be doing the full mockup for this
67:05 - website design this will involve adding
67:07 - in actual pictures and content and other
67:09 - things to flesh it out here are the
67:11 - items we were working on previous videos
67:14 - here we can see the example of the
67:17 - wireframes we've created for a home page
67:19 - a features page and a contact us page as
67:22 - well as a responsive mobile menu
67:25 - if we go across here we can see how in
67:28 - the next video we actually built out a
67:30 - small ui
67:32 - prototype for this one here we've got a
67:34 - bit more of a idea of what the pages
67:37 - will actually look like
67:39 - we're going to use this as reference and
67:42 - copy this out to create our actual
67:44 - mock-up in today's video this will
67:47 - involve filling out real content which
67:49 - will mean that we probably need this
67:51 - website to have some sort of a meaning
67:53 - or a real logo with an actual bit of
67:56 - content here
67:57 - now i'm doing my own sort of a website
68:01 - recently it's called enhance ui and it's
68:04 - going to be designed for developers so i
68:06 - think this will be a perfect example
68:08 - where we can fill out some content and
68:10 - build it around that sort of a brand
68:13 - the first thing i'd like to be able to
68:14 - do is pull in a logo over here right now
68:18 - we just have a placeholder for one i've
68:20 - actually got a logo ready to go so i'm
68:22 - just gonna drag and drop it right into
68:24 - here and we're going to make it around
68:27 - the same size here and this will just
68:30 - fit in nicely there
68:32 - the other thing i want to be able to do
68:33 - is change the background now we're
68:36 - working with a much darker shade here so
68:39 - this gray here probably won't work very
68:42 - well so what i'm going to do is i'm
68:43 - going to select this layer here and i'm
68:45 - just going to grab the background color
68:47 - of 1e1e1e
68:49 - which is what we're using for this
68:50 - example
68:51 - i'm also going to grab the title and
68:53 - subtitle here and i'm going to select
68:56 - both of these to have a white color
68:58 - because right now they're not very
68:59 - visible
69:00 - and this gets us started with this
69:02 - section over here
69:04 - the next thing i'd like to do is add a
69:06 - bit of a background to it so here we've
69:08 - got a few different options we could add
69:10 - maybe a background color or a background
69:13 - image and in this case i'd like to be
69:15 - able to grab a background image for it
69:17 - so i've got another image which i've
69:19 - gotten ready here and i'm just going to
69:21 - drag it in we're going to move this
69:23 - layer just beneath our rectangle here
69:26 - and place it in here just like this and
69:28 - this should fit in quite nicely now
69:31 - we've got an example of how a background
69:34 - image and some text here can fit in very
69:37 - well for our header section and all we
69:39 - really need to do is clean up maybe the
69:41 - menu and the title here
69:43 - so for the title bit i'd like to write
69:46 - in something like
69:47 - design for developers
69:50 - and for this learn how
69:53 - to enhance your website
69:57 - so there's our title and description and
70:00 - the only other thing i want to do is
70:01 - maybe throw in an image of a book in
70:04 - here so in this case i've got another
70:06 - image ready to go with the book that i'm
70:09 - working on for this website which is
70:11 - just over here and it's already got a
70:12 - bit of a box shadow which we can apply
70:15 - and as we can see these elements have
70:17 - fit in quite nicely and give us an
70:19 - example of what this will look like
70:21 - the only thing left here is this menu
70:24 - and right now we can't see it very well
70:26 - in this gray sort of a format so what i
70:28 - might do is double select it here and
70:31 - change the background color to either
70:32 - black or white depending on what works
70:36 - right now it feels like neither of them
70:37 - work so i might play around with a few
70:39 - different colors the blue here that
70:41 - we're using for the side does look
70:42 - pretty good so i might use that blue
70:44 - here with the white for the current item
70:47 - we might make the text here a black
70:50 - while the other text items here we might
70:53 - make a white color and that stands out
70:55 - quite nicely
70:56 - the only other thing i feel like we're
70:58 - missing is that maybe this logo here is
71:00 - a little bit too big so i'm going to
71:02 - reduce it down just a tad so it's almost
71:05 - the same size as our menu over here and
71:07 - that pretty much does our uh image here
71:10 - it's it's okay because we've got this
71:13 - slider section here and we might not be
71:15 - using this so i i could change this to a
71:18 - white color and we might leave it for
71:20 - the time being we might have a look at
71:21 - doing other sliders in the future here
71:24 - but i think that's enough to get us off
71:26 - the ground
71:27 - the next bit we have here is this about
71:29 - us section and we've got a small area
71:32 - here for images what i might do for this
71:35 - image is just put in a placeholder for
71:37 - the book once more
71:39 - so in this case i might do something
71:41 - like grab this design image that i've
71:45 - created as part of the book
71:46 - and place it in here
71:48 - by doing so we almost don't have enough
71:51 - room but what we could do is we could
71:54 - move this image next to the rectangle
71:56 - and mask it so i'm just going to do that
71:58 - i'm going to select both of them i'm
72:00 - going to do use mask and then that fits
72:02 - in quite nicely in there
72:05 - there we've got an example of one of the
72:08 - pages from the book
72:09 - and i think that seems to work quite
72:12 - well the next thing we want to do is for
72:14 - this about us section we want to give it
72:16 - a bit better of a title
72:18 - since we both have some content here for
72:22 - a main title and a subtitle what i'm
72:24 - going to do here is just copy in a main
72:27 - title
72:28 - and then add a subtitle which gives a
72:31 - little bit more information for it
72:33 - finally we might also give it a bit of a
72:35 - description so i'm just going to paste
72:38 - in a bit of content here to get us
72:40 - started with that
72:42 - we've got this section almost done the
72:44 - only other thing we might do is make it
72:47 - a little bit bigger so i'm going to drag
72:49 - down some of these elements here so that
72:51 - we have a bit more room to play around
72:53 - with
72:54 - so here i'm just going to move this more
72:56 - button down just a tad
72:59 - and for this section here i might also
73:02 - highlight some of the prominent areas
73:05 - like for example my name over here which
73:07 - i might want to stand out so i'll also
73:09 - build that
73:10 - and otherwise that looks pretty good
73:13 - now with that done we might move this
73:14 - button back up a little bit and we can
73:16 - also increase this mask a little bit so
73:19 - for this i'm gonna grab this out and
73:22 - just increase the height here at the top
73:24 - and at the bottom and now that looks
73:25 - like a full on page
73:27 - the only other thing here is that this
73:29 - button is still gray and it doesn't seem
73:31 - consistent with the overall theme with
73:34 - this theme we've got a bit of blacks and
73:36 - whites and blue so i'm going to keep
73:37 - that consistent throughout the design
73:40 - so this takes up our
73:42 - slider here and our about us section and
73:44 - we can move this sponsored and site map
73:47 - section back up
73:49 - now previously we did have a sponsored
73:52 - section over here and this was more or
73:55 - less for when we were doing
73:58 - sponsors but in my book here i don't
74:00 - actually have any sponsors so instead
74:03 - what i might do is turn this into
74:04 - testimonials uh here i'll also put in a
74:07 - small description so maybe what other
74:10 - people are saying
74:12 - and instead of having say all these
74:14 - boxes we might reduce this down to just
74:17 - a couple
74:18 - so here i'm gonna just have maybe one
74:21 - here that spans four columns one here
74:24 - that spans four columns and one here
74:27 - that spans four columns
74:29 - for each one of these we might put in
74:31 - some text and we might also change the
74:33 - background color for this
74:35 - so for the background color i might do
74:37 - the blue here just so that it stands out
74:39 - a bit more and for the text i might set
74:41 - both of these as white so that they also
74:44 - stand out nicely
74:46 - we'll also make sure that we center this
74:48 - because right now it's a little bit
74:49 - off-center but that's looking much
74:51 - better
74:52 - then for these items here i'm just going
74:53 - to select them to have a white
74:55 - background and we can put our
74:57 - testimonial quotes inside of there we're
74:59 - still aligning to our column design here
75:02 - but we're just repurposing the content
75:04 - based of what we're going to put in here
75:06 - i've got a few different bits of
75:08 - testimonials that i'd like to put in so
75:10 - let's actually grab our text tool over
75:12 - here and put in a small bit of text here
75:15 - i'm going to reduce the font size here
75:17 - to about 18 pixels and we'll also do the
75:20 - opacity to about 66
75:23 - and finally we'll just center this over
75:25 - here
75:26 - the first testimonial that we have here
75:29 - is from traversing media from brad so
75:31 - i'm just gonna put this in just below
75:34 - and make it bold so that we can see what
75:36 - he's been saying we've got two more
75:38 - testimonials which i'm going to put in
75:41 - and one is here from
75:44 - web dev simplified so i'm just going to
75:48 - copy over these two
75:50 - and we're going to reuse them as we need
75:53 - so let's just paste them here
75:55 - and here
75:57 - let's also move them up a little bit
75:59 - just so that they all align about 15 to
76:01 - 20 pixels from the top
76:03 - and let's copy over this content over
76:06 - here so that's nice i've got a little
76:08 - bit too much text there so i'm going to
76:10 - reduce that just a tad and let's put in
76:13 - web dev simplified in here
76:16 - and for our last we've got a guy here
76:19 - called deved
76:20 - and dev ed also had some nice things to
76:23 - say so we'll paste that in here
76:26 - and
76:26 - that should be it for our testimonials
76:30 - and finally we've got our site map here
76:32 - now this doesn't change too much i'm
76:34 - just going to make this that same dark
76:37 - color that we were using here in our
76:39 - header content
76:40 - and we're going to copy over our logo
76:43 - that we had and replace the one over
76:45 - here with this one over here
76:48 - great
76:50 - i don't really have a phone or email
76:53 - just yet but the rest of our content is
76:56 - still mostly the same so i'm just gonna
76:59 - copy it across
77:01 - and move it up a little bit just so that
77:04 - it fits in nicely so there it is
77:07 - and i think that's about it we don't
77:10 - really have to change our footer here
77:12 - with this copyright
77:14 - and this finishes up our design
77:17 - now that the desktop version is done we
77:19 - can take a look at creating a mobile
77:21 - version for this website to do this
77:23 - we're going to select the frame and
77:24 - we're going to select an iphone over
77:26 - here on the right
77:27 - i'm just going to expand this out to
77:31 - the bottom over here and we can start
77:33 - filling it out with content
77:35 - the first thing we'll do is probably
77:37 - grab the hero section and paste it in
77:39 - here the problem with this hero section
77:41 - right now is that we're actually
77:44 - utilizing too much width and height
77:47 - i might actually reduce the height here
77:49 - just a tad so it's about the same as
77:51 - before and i'm also going to redu remove
77:53 - the slider
77:55 - the content in here also doesn't fit in
77:58 - very nicely right now we could probably
78:01 - make it smaller so for this description
78:03 - here i might just change it to 24 pixels
78:07 - and for this one over here maybe to 48
78:09 - pixels and we'll break the line on both
78:12 - of them that way we can see them here we
78:15 - could also center them and that way they
78:17 - might look a little bit better
78:18 - and finally we can copy over this image
78:21 - and also make it a little bit smaller
78:23 - and just place it in below so that seems
78:25 - to look pretty good
78:27 - we also have our logo which we can copy
78:29 - across
78:30 - and like all mobile websites they also
78:32 - need a bit of a hamburger menu and a
78:35 - hamburger menu is pretty simple it's
78:37 - just three lines so let's actually
78:39 - create three white lines here at the top
78:42 - left and this can later expand out to
78:45 - our mobile menu so i'm just gonna copy
78:47 - paste this across a few times
78:49 - and we should see it pop up let's grab
78:52 - one here one here we'll give it just a
78:55 - little bit of spacing
78:57 - and let's do the same amount of spacing
78:59 - for this line and there's our mobile
79:01 - menu nice and simple to do i'm just
79:03 - going to move this here to the top left
79:06 - and the header section is more or less
79:07 - done now
79:09 - let's take a look at doing this uh about
79:11 - section
79:12 - so like previous we can just copy across
79:15 - some of the content but in this case i'm
79:17 - going to copy over the text first with
79:19 - this read more button
79:21 - and i'm just going to paste it in here
79:23 - we're going to reduce the font sizes
79:25 - again so here i'll do 48 pixels this one
79:29 - here can be 24 pixels and this one here
79:32 - can possibly be 18 pixels we'll collapse
79:35 - down the width for each one of those so
79:38 - they might break the line a little bit
79:40 - but we'll also get a little bit of
79:41 - padding here on the left and right and
79:43 - that seems to fit in quite nicely the
79:45 - only other thing i want to do is change
79:47 - this uh this read
79:50 - more button and in this case i might
79:52 - want to make it smaller
79:54 - and to do that i'm going to scale it
79:56 - just a tad down here
79:59 - also since we're centering most things
80:01 - i'm going to center this as well and all
80:04 - of that looks good besides the title
80:06 - here which we need to expand out a
80:07 - little bit
80:08 - this read more also it doesn't seem to
80:10 - be centered very well so i'm just going
80:12 - to manually center that
80:14 - and there we go so we've got our learn
80:16 - more content looking pretty good over
80:18 - here
80:19 - i'll finally copy across this image that
80:22 - we had and for this image i'm also going
80:24 - to make it a little bit smaller by
80:26 - scaling it down here and just moving it
80:29 - below our section so now it's nice and
80:32 - centered and we can move on to the next
80:34 - part of our website which is the
80:36 - testimonials
80:37 - one thing to note is that each one of
80:39 - these sections might sometimes stay the
80:42 - same height or sometimes get a little
80:43 - bit bigger depending on how many columns
80:45 - and how much content you have in there
80:47 - but it shouldn't matter too much as long
80:49 - as it's useful on the mobile version
80:51 - for the testimonials i'm going to copy
80:53 - over the whole item here
80:56 - but since there's so much i might
80:58 - actually just copy it bit by bit so
81:00 - first let's copy over this background
81:02 - and place it in here
81:05 - and right now it is not appearing
81:07 - because it's not in the right place i'm
81:09 - not sure where it's gone here
81:12 - so here's the background and here is our
81:16 - iphone
81:17 - and what i want to be able to do is copy
81:19 - this background right in here and move
81:21 - it in
81:22 - there we go that looks much better now
81:25 - so for this testimonial section
81:28 - let's copy over these titles and we'll
81:30 - paste them in here
81:32 - once again we'll have to reduce the font
81:34 - size so here i'll do 48 pixels for the
81:37 - testimonial i'll center it and this one
81:39 - here i'll do 24 pixels and i'll center
81:42 - that as well
81:43 - and then we can just copy them over
81:45 - these ones actually could probably fit
81:47 - in nicely as they are now so i'm going
81:50 - to copy over this section here
81:53 - and we'll paste it in with a little bit
81:55 - of padding from the left and the right
81:57 - and make it a little bit taller
81:59 - and then we can just copy over the text
82:01 - here we almost don't need to even change
82:03 - that that seems to fit in perfectly as
82:05 - it is now
82:07 - we could reduce it just to one
82:09 - testimonial but in this case i want to
82:11 - keep all three so i'm just gonna copy
82:14 - this across and give it some margin here
82:16 - from the top
82:17 - let's copy our second testimonial in
82:20 - here and our third
82:22 - and i forgot to keep the
82:24 - the person here so let's copy that
82:26 - across one more time
82:29 - and
82:30 - that is definitely not seeming to copy
82:33 - across properly i'm not sure what's
82:34 - going on there
82:36 - uh it's gone a bit wonky
82:41 - let's try that one more time
82:44 - so i'm just gonna grab it over here copy
82:46 - it down
82:47 - and grab this one
82:49 - and copy it across
82:51 - and there we go
82:53 - let's close off this section here give
82:55 - it a little bit of padding from the bot
82:57 - bottom and finally we just need to do
83:00 - our footer design now
83:02 - so for our footer
83:04 - we could copy across the whole section
83:07 - because we need the contact us the form
83:09 - the site map
83:10 - and the logo so let's do that we'll need
83:13 - to make this whole section a bit longer
83:15 - to be able to fit it all in
83:18 - and to do this now we simply copy across
83:21 - each one of these elements across or
83:23 - even reuse some of the elements we have
83:26 - and update the colors that we have on
83:28 - them so in this case i'm just going to
83:30 - create the rectangle over here to start
83:32 - off at this level
83:34 - and then i'm just going to copy over
83:36 - each one of these columns which is easy
83:39 - enough
83:40 - then when we copy it across we'll see
83:42 - that it just should fit in nicely some
83:45 - things we might need to adjust so for
83:47 - example with the inputs i would normally
83:50 - recommend them to have a full width
83:52 - and all of these texts again i would say
83:55 - would be recommended to update their
83:57 - sizing just so that they're all
83:59 - consistent and everything updates
84:01 - accordingly
84:02 - so there's our contact us let's copy
84:04 - over our sitemap we'll put this one
84:06 - below
84:08 - i'm just going to reduce the size on
84:10 - that one as well
84:13 - and finally here we've got our about
84:16 - site map section
84:19 - and our logo which we can paste here
84:21 - below
84:23 - and our phone and email which i'm just
84:25 - going to
84:26 - copy across over here
84:28 - so that's more or less all of this done
84:31 - uh
84:32 - we just have our copyright section here
84:35 - at the very end which we can copy across
84:40 - and let's put this into our design over
84:43 - here just at the very very bottom
84:46 - and let's copy over this one and we can
84:49 - make this font size a little bit smaller
84:51 - as well and that should almost fit in
84:53 - there it probably needs to break a line
84:56 - and have a little bit more room
84:59 - but it seems to have fit in there just
85:01 - okay
85:02 - i'm going to actually make it a little
85:03 - bit bigger so to do that let's select
85:06 - the frame here at the top
85:08 - let's make the frame a little bit bigger
85:11 - and then that'll give us just enough
85:12 - room there for the copyright section to
85:15 - fit in
85:16 - great so that's the mobile version done
85:19 - and as you can see it's followed more or
85:21 - less the same principles here
85:25 - the only other thing is sometimes when
85:26 - we increase the size of our page some of
85:29 - these elements might go a bit weird uh
85:32 - and this is just a figma thing so i'm
85:34 - just gonna fix that up
85:36 - and i think that's more or less that
85:38 - done
85:39 - i hope you guys enjoyed this video this
85:42 - figma design i'm gonna share in the
85:45 - description below so you guys can have a
85:47 - look at it and you can do your own
85:49 - iterations of it based on the initial
85:52 - design that we had as well it's really
85:54 - fun and simple to play with and it gives
85:56 - you an example of how we can create a
85:58 - mock-up really quickly based from a
86:01 - simple ui prototype
86:03 - in the next video we might take a look
86:04 - at maybe building this out using html
86:07 - and css or even putting it into a
86:10 - framework like react or maybe even
86:12 - wordpress but hopefully this is an
86:15 - introduction to show you just how
86:16 - important it is to be able to do design
86:19 - in simple steps
