00:00 - in jQuery the animate method performs a
00:03 - custom animation of a set of CSS
00:05 - properties this method changes an
00:08 - element from one state to another with
00:09 - CSS Styles the CSS property value is
00:13 - changed gradually to create an animated
00:15 - effect only numeric values can be
00:17 - animated such as margin being 30 pixels
00:20 - string values cannot be animated um such
00:23 - as when you're setting the background
00:24 - color to blue or red or something like
00:26 - that so here's the basic syntax here so
00:29 - first you're going to have your element
00:30 - selection and then it's going to be
00:32 - animate and then you're going to pass in
00:35 - your properties your CSS properties that
00:37 - you want to change and then there's
00:38 - three optional things you can pass in
00:40 - the duration easing and complete that's
00:44 - just a callback function that it calls
00:46 - when the animation is complete and
00:48 - there's also another syntax uh this one
00:51 - where you pass in the properties just
00:53 - like before and then you pass in the
00:56 - options this is just a JavaScript object
00:58 - you pass in with V various key value
01:01 - pairs for different options this just
01:04 - allows you to have a little more control
01:06 - than the first method because there's a
01:08 - lot of different options you can pass in
01:10 - almost all the options have to do with
01:13 - calling a callback function at various
01:16 - points in the animation if you want more
01:18 - information about the options you can
01:20 - use for that you can check the link in
01:22 - the description so let's look at this
01:24 - example down here well first of all on
01:26 - our page we just have the the Run button
01:29 - and the hello div block and then I just
01:32 - have some basic CSS in here to style
01:35 - things our JavaScript down here we're
01:37 - going to select the the go button and
01:40 - we're going to add a click function so
01:42 - on click it's going to run this function
01:44 - here now inside the function we are
01:47 - going to select the block which is the
01:50 - the hello block and we're going to run
01:53 - animate the first thing we pass in is
01:56 - the properties we have some key value
01:58 - pairs that show the CSS property we're
02:00 - going to animate over the course of the
02:02 - animation it's going to put all these
02:05 - CSS properties to this value so it
02:08 - starts at opacity 100% but we're going
02:11 - to set it to 50% so it's going to start
02:14 - at 100% And gradually go to 50% here
02:18 - margin left now uh just so you know on
02:20 - CSS it would be margin Dash left but in
02:24 - jqu you take off the dash and then you
02:26 - capitalize the first letter of the
02:28 - second word so you can see we use a
02:31 - slightly different thing instead of
02:32 - margin left 50 it's margin left plus
02:36 - equals 50 so it's just going to add 50
02:39 - pixels to whatever the margin already
02:41 - was for the opacity it's always going to
02:43 - go to 50% and then height it's also
02:46 - going to go to a specific thing 400
02:48 - pixels and then the next item you pass
02:51 - in is the duration so I pass in 3,000
02:54 - that's 3,000 milliseconds or 3 seconds
02:57 - then we pass an easing easing is either
02:59 - going to be swing or linear swing is the
03:02 - default so if you don't pass in anything
03:04 - here it'll just be swing or linear so
03:07 - linear just moved at a constant rate
03:10 - swing kind of eases in a little bit to
03:13 - the beginning and the ending and then
03:15 - the complete that's the Callback
03:17 - function we're going to add at the end
03:19 - which we are going to select this which
03:21 - is the div block that we're animating
03:24 - and after that we're going to add
03:26 - another HTML code we're going to add
03:28 - this animation complete div so let's uh
03:31 - see what this is going to look like hit
03:33 - the Run button and you can see the
03:35 - opacity changes the margin left changes
03:38 - the height changes and then the
03:39 - animation complete runs at the bottom
03:42 - now let's see what happens when I hit
03:43 - the Run button
03:46 - again so as you can see the opacity did
03:50 - not change the height did not change but
03:53 - the margin left changeed when I press
03:54 - the Run button again that's because we
03:56 - have this plus equals 50 so just adds 50
04:00 - to whatever the value was but the other
04:02 - values are just set so it's not going to
04:04 - change those things and you can see it
04:06 - added the animation complete div at the
04:08 - end again so there's two of them now I'm
04:10 - going to take off this easing one so
04:13 - it's going to default to swing so let's
04:16 - see what that looks like it's just a
04:18 - little
04:22 - different so you can see just at the
04:24 - beginning and ending of the animation
04:26 - it's a little slower now I'm just going
04:28 - to actually change this animation to
04:30 - show you how you can chain animations so
04:33 - I'm just going to get rid of all this
04:36 - and then I'm going to do
04:39 - animate we're going to set the width to
04:41 - 90% I'm just going to copy this and then
04:44 - paste it a few times we're going to
04:47 - change the font
04:50 - size so now you can see I've changed
04:52 - these animations so we're going to
04:55 - change the width then the font size then
04:57 - the Border left left width let's see
04:59 - what that looks
05:04 - like so you can see it ran one animation
05:07 - after the other when you just chain them
05:09 - by adding animate and putting the next
05:11 - animation there and obviously within
05:14 - each animation you can animate more than
05:16 - one property but this is just an example
05:18 - with one property okay that's the basics
05:21 - of the animate method in jQuery again
05:24 - check the link in the descriptions for
05:26 - the other options you can use to pass in
05:28 - which are mainly about different
05:30 - callback functions you can use at
05:32 - various points in the animation my name
05:34 - is Bo KS thanks for watching don't
05:36 - forget to subscribe and remember use
05:38 - your code for good
