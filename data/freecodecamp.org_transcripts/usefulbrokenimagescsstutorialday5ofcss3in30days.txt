00:00 - hey everyone what's up welcome back to
00:02 - day five of css3 in 30 days today we're
00:05 - going to be building something super
00:07 - simple
00:08 - and super easy but it's really really
00:10 - meaningful and can really kind of take
00:12 - your websites or your applications to
00:15 - the next level when it comes to user
00:17 - experience now let me show you what i
00:18 - mean jump over here into my browser
00:20 - we're going to do something called
00:22 - useful broken images now whether it's a
00:24 - typo in the image tag source or the
00:26 - image tag itself was misplaced or
00:28 - removed on the server
00:31 - images break all the time on the web
00:33 - the problem is the browser's default way
00:35 - to display a broken image is typically
00:38 - pretty darn ugly you know where you have
00:40 - that little like screen shot it shows
00:42 - like a little image thumbnail with like
00:43 - a crack through the middle or a rip and
00:45 - it just it's a broken image icon and it
00:47 - doesn't look very good sometimes it's
00:49 - just
00:50 - the browser's default way of displaying
00:52 - that kind of looks bad you can fix that
00:55 - however and actually use it as an
00:57 - opportunity to enhance the user's
00:59 - experience on your web pages with css
01:02 - now that's your challenge this lesson so
01:04 - you kind of take you know
01:06 - when websites throw you lemons you
01:08 - create lemonade right so we're going to
01:10 - be creating useful broken images let me
01:11 - show you
01:12 - this is a standard broken image
01:14 - it cannot find this image on purpose i
01:16 - coded it improperly so it's finding an
01:18 - image that is not located on the server
01:20 - anywhere
01:21 - this is what it looks like looks
01:23 - terrible
01:24 - it makes you look bad but if you scroll
01:26 - down here check this out
01:29 - flying eagle not found with a nice
01:31 - little icon a camera with an x and then
01:33 - a nice dotted line around it it's just
01:35 - it looks nicer
01:37 - now the image isn't there so that sucks
01:39 - but it's pulling in information and
01:41 - notifying the user of what happened
01:44 - this is a much more fluid and positive
01:47 - user experience let's find out how to
01:49 - code that right now shall we over here
01:52 - in our code editor i have my number five
01:54 - useful broken images
01:56 - course files go ahead and download that
01:58 - it's in this module you can click to
01:59 - download it it'll give you a dropbox
02:01 - link something really simple so you can
02:03 - download the useful broken images and
02:05 - index is the markup it's very simple all
02:08 - it is is an image tag with no with uh no
02:11 - image there so
02:12 - there's no image on the server called
02:13 - broken image i did that on purpose and
02:15 - then an alt attribute that's important
02:17 - because we're going to be using that in
02:18 - css
02:20 - that's all it is sandbox is where we're
02:21 - going to be coding up our uh styles and
02:24 - final is the final result so let's go
02:26 - ahead and do that code our styles right
02:28 - here first thing we're going to be doing
02:30 - is selecting a class just called image
02:33 - now i could have just selected the image
02:34 - tag but i just wanted to do it this way
02:36 - and we're going to say position relative
02:39 - the display will be inline block the
02:41 - font size let's do something like 0.7
02:44 - rim
02:45 - text align
02:46 - center
02:48 - text transform
02:50 - uppercase and save
02:53 - now if we head over to our browser
02:54 - you're going to see here
02:55 - uh that it's changed the
02:58 - the default style of the broken image
03:00 - now i want to make that font size a
03:01 - little bit bigger so i'm actually just
03:02 - going to say one rim and that should
03:05 - make it the default size i like that
03:06 - okay and now what we're going to do this
03:08 - is easy we're almost done image the
03:11 - after sudo element
03:14 - we're going to say display inherit so
03:16 - we're going to inherit the inline block
03:18 - style we're going to position
03:20 - absolute
03:22 - top 0
03:23 - left 0
03:25 - we're going to do width 100 percent
03:27 - min width it's going to be a minimum of
03:30 - 200 pixels padding will be 10 20 10
03:34 - and 45 to account for the icon that
03:36 - we're going to put in the left side
03:38 - we're going to go border oh we need a
03:40 - semicolon up here that's why
03:42 - border
03:43 - dashed dash to one pixel triple eight
03:46 - and then we're gonna say background
03:49 - color
03:50 - is gonna be
03:52 - f zero f zero f zero
03:54 - and then the background
03:56 - image we're gonna pull that url called
03:59 - no image
04:00 - dot png right here in our useful broken
04:02 - images folder directory background size
04:05 - for that image is going to be 10
04:08 - background repeat no repeat background
04:11 - position
04:12 - we're going to put it at 15 pixels in
04:14 - the x 10 pixels on the y z index 1
04:18 - and the content this is going to be cool
04:19 - so i'm going to save that actually save
04:21 - so far and see what we have now you can
04:25 - see there's nothing there
04:26 - we did all these styles but nothing
04:27 - showed up
04:29 - that's because we didn't do the content
04:31 - property yet so you always have to do
04:32 - content on an after or before pseudo
04:34 - element
04:35 - back here in the code editor simple we
04:37 - could do something like content to empty
04:39 - string
04:40 - now if we head back you'll see that
04:42 - something is appearing but it's this
04:44 - obviously doesn't look very good so
04:45 - we're going to fix that by adding text
04:47 - within that element
04:49 - and we're going to we're going to adjust
04:51 - that so so here in content
04:53 - we're going to do the double string and
04:56 - then
04:57 - right after that we're going to say
04:58 - attribute so it's the attribute value
05:01 - for the content property
05:02 - and we're going to say alt so what's
05:04 - that doing it's looking for the html
05:06 - attribute alt
05:08 - the value of it so here the alt flying
05:11 - eagle
05:12 - so it's looking for that attribute alt
05:14 - so it's going to grab that value and put
05:16 - it as the content and then after that
05:18 - another string to close one double
05:20 - string to close that previous one
05:24 - and then
05:25 - not found and then close the string one
05:27 - more time so how does this work so we
05:29 - have an open
05:30 - uh double string
05:32 - which closes over here
05:34 - but we also have another set of strings
05:36 - in here that wrap around the attribute
05:39 - alt so it's just something that we kind
05:40 - of have to do
05:42 - it's like concatenating the text so
05:45 - attribute alt so the alt text
05:48 - not found save that
05:50 - go over here to our browser check it out
05:52 - flying eagle not found we got that icon
05:54 - from our useful broken images directory
05:57 - nice and now if we had a different image
05:59 - let's go to our index and i'm just going
06:00 - to add another image here and say broken
06:03 - image 2
06:04 - and change the alt text to like let's
06:07 - just say paddle board and then i'm going
06:09 - to put uh a break tag save that check it
06:12 - out in the browser so paddle board not
06:14 - found now they're stacking on top of
06:15 - each other the reason why that's
06:16 - happening is because these are the after
06:18 - pseudo elements the actual image itself
06:22 - so if i inspect this
06:24 - the image itself is is this large and
06:27 - then the after pseudo element is that
06:29 - size so the image they're actually
06:32 - stacking on top of each other perfectly
06:33 - but it's the after pseudo-element that's
06:35 - conflicting so we just give the image
06:36 - some space around it so here i'm just
06:39 - going to say margin images will have
06:41 - like a margin of 0
06:44 - 0 40 pixels and then that should solve
06:47 - the problem there we go so over here we
06:49 - got some space nice looks great so that
06:53 - is day five useful broken images that's
06:56 - all we had to do is really simple but
06:57 - very powerful because hey it's nice to
06:59 - have a nicer
07:01 - user experience and we can do that with
07:03 - our broken images you didn't maybe you
07:05 - didn't know that you could do that and
07:06 - it's a pretty cool trick that's useful
07:07 - in your web development in your your
07:09 - portfolio your website apps applications
07:12 - client sites so hopefully you enjoyed
07:14 - the useful broken images lesson hang
07:16 - tight for tomorrow we're going to do day
07:18 - six and we've got some more fun stuff to
07:20 - code up in css i'll catch you there bye
07:22 - now
