00:04 - hello everyone welcome to another
00:06 - episode of connecting the dots today on
00:08 - the show we have april april thank you
00:11 - so much for joining us how are you i'm
00:13 - done all right yourself i'm doing great
00:15 - i uh i'm so thrilled to have you on the
00:17 - show i've been following your career for
00:18 - a long time i think you're doing some of
00:21 - the most interesting work in tech right
00:23 - now and i'm really really excited to
00:26 - talk about it um so for those of us who
00:29 - aren't familiar oh no i have echo
00:31 - so for those of us who are not familiar
00:33 - with your your background and your
00:34 - career
00:36 - what are you doing for work right now
00:38 - well give me one second i am picking up
00:41 - everything you're saying sorry
00:44 - plus like twice oh no yeah i have an
00:47 - echo
00:48 - one moment
00:59 - i had the youtube open in the background
01:00 - so it started playing again
01:02 - you hear it well i had it for a minute
01:04 - but it's it's off for me now
01:06 - okay how did you turn yours off because
01:08 - i can't even adjust my
01:10 - um i just i had to mute the the youtube
01:13 - channel like if you've got the youtube
01:15 - open in the background somewhere
01:17 - oh i'm still getting it
01:20 - um let me check if there's anything i
01:22 - can
01:25 - i don't think there's anything that i
01:26 - have on that would be going through to
01:28 - you
01:31 - see the chat's not getting an echo this
01:34 - is the only screen i have open
01:40 - uh
01:41 - nope
01:45 - hmm
01:46 - this is interesting
01:49 - okay it's only me
01:52 - one second everyone i'm trying to get to
01:54 - my audio settings to see
01:56 - if there's anything weird happening in
01:58 - there
02:00 - and
02:04 - did it just start when we went live
02:08 - speak for me yeah can you hear me
02:11 - i can
02:13 - i turn
02:14 - i turn down
02:16 - there's two zooms on my computer that's
02:18 - weird one says zoom it says zoom
02:19 - meetings all right we're good to go so
02:22 - re-say what it was that you said yes
02:25 - okay sorry about that so
02:27 - um
02:28 - yeah the the question i had is is for
02:30 - those of us who aren't familiar with
02:32 - your career do you want to talk a little
02:33 - bit about what you're doing right now in
02:34 - your job yeah so right now i'm a senior
02:37 - cloud advocate at microsoft with the
02:39 - spatial computing technology team
02:42 - and i work on
02:44 - a majority of my job is creating content
02:46 - to help new people learn about the mixed
02:49 - reality space as well as some of the
02:51 - different tools that we offer with
02:53 - microsoft
02:54 - and in addition to that engaging with
02:57 - the developer community seeing what
02:59 - people are building and just helping
03:01 - people in general with getting started
03:04 - yeah and mixed reality is is interesting
03:07 - because i feel like so mixed reality is
03:10 - is that kind of an umbrella term for
03:12 - like virtual reality augmented reality
03:15 - um kind of anything you would do with uh
03:18 - with a either a device like a headset
03:20 - like an oculus rift or even the stuff
03:22 - that you would do on your phone with
03:23 - like um like tabletop games where you
03:25 - play with your camera and stuff is that
03:26 - right yeah and it's it's a spectrum
03:28 - that's how you can look at it so on one
03:30 - side you have augmented reality and then
03:32 - on the other end you have virtual
03:34 - reality so
03:35 - with augmented reality um you're able
03:39 - the spectrum kind of like
03:41 - depends where you're on the spectrum but
03:42 - with augmented reality that's when
03:44 - you're able to do things with um as you
03:47 - mentioned your devices
03:49 - while also more or less blending in the
03:52 - real world
03:53 - as
03:54 - far as virtual reality on the other end
03:56 - that's when like you're fully immersed
03:59 - in a um
04:01 - in a environment and you don't have that
04:04 - access to the real world around you so
04:07 - that's when you get more into your vr
04:08 - headsets right um somewhere in the
04:11 - middle is spatial computing and that's
04:12 - the area that i work in and with spatial
04:16 - you start getting into an area where
04:18 - your holograms are going to be spatially
04:21 - aware as well which is
04:23 - really cool and something that i've been
04:24 - working on lately so
04:26 - i would say probably one of the most
04:28 - coolest uh examples i've seen of that
04:31 - is when i met the folks over at
04:33 - magically
04:35 - for the very first time i tried one of
04:36 - their devices
04:38 - there were these like little like
04:41 - knights
04:42 - that like appeared in the actual room
04:45 - yeah and they were just like fighting
04:47 - with each other and they actually knew
04:49 - what was actually real in the actual
04:51 - world so they would avoid actual objects
04:54 - and they could like hop on top of stuff
04:56 - and do things so it was pretty cool
04:59 - that's more so the area that i typically
05:02 - focus on but i do things within um vr as
05:06 - well and um ar2 but yeah yeah so
05:11 - what a what a fascinating space and i
05:12 - feel like we've seen a couple things
05:14 - like this uh like isn't the new mario
05:16 - kart
05:18 - kind of the the spatially aware um where
05:21 - you you set up the the cart in your
05:23 - living room and then you can like crash
05:25 - into your coffee table and stuff
05:26 - yeah i believe i've seen that i'm not
05:28 - big on gaming like at all but
05:31 - i believe i've i've seen that um
05:34 - in videos but if that's the premise of
05:37 - it then yeah that's essentially what it
05:39 - is is um yeah making your hologram
05:42 - spatially aware yeah that is whatever
05:44 - yeah
05:44 - it that feels so much like the future
05:46 - and and that so that's something that to
05:48 - me feels like
05:50 - really unapproachable like i if i was
05:52 - gonna try to do that i don't even know
05:53 - where i would start and so
05:56 - like
05:57 - is this a space that you would recommend
05:58 - for people to to get into and try
06:01 - yeah i honestly would say give it a try
06:04 - i've only been working in this space
06:05 - since the summer of 2019 so i myself am
06:09 - still pretty new to it and
06:12 - as time has gone by since then until now
06:14 - there are way more resources available
06:17 - on the internet for how to get started
06:19 - whether you're doing some of the um
06:22 - some of the learning paths on unity
06:25 - i'm a unity person so i can't speak to
06:27 - working within unreal or um with web but
06:31 - unity i know provides different
06:34 - tutorials that you can take a look into
06:36 - and then also with microsoft we do as
06:38 - well so aside from our mixed reality
06:40 - documentation and our uh journey paths
06:44 - for folks who are getting started i have
06:46 - a police car going by so sorry about
06:48 - that
06:49 - but um we have that to help you get
06:51 - started and then um i also authored to
06:54 - learn modules on microsoft learn that
06:56 - are also available for getting started
06:58 - and our mixed reality team has done the
07:01 - same thing as well so
07:03 - it depends on
07:06 - you know where you land for learning but
07:08 - i would highly highly suggest starting
07:10 - with learning c sharp if anything
07:14 - and then from there start learning uh
07:16 - unity if that's your chosen platform and
07:19 - or unreal and then from there start to
07:21 - get into the concept of what mixed
07:23 - reality is and dive a little deeper with
07:25 - what you can do with that very cool and
07:27 - and so do you see this as being like it
07:30 - seems like we're seeing more and more of
07:31 - this so do you see this as being a
07:33 - growth area in tech where there's going
07:34 - to be a lot of hiring and opportunity
07:37 - yeah and it's actually an area that we
07:39 - classify within my organization at
07:41 - microsoft as emerging tech if you will
07:44 - so
07:45 - it's one of those things where within
07:47 - recent years we've started seeing more
07:49 - and more companies create products if
07:52 - you will and tools and software around
07:54 - it it's like that brand new it's in a
07:57 - sense it's like that brand new thing but
07:59 - it's also not brand new this technology
08:01 - has been around for years it's just that
08:03 - more so in recent years more folks are
08:07 - starting to get involved with developing
08:09 - in that space or even creating in that
08:11 - space and so as more companies come out
08:14 - with um with even more advanced
08:16 - technology in that area you're going to
08:19 - see
08:19 - more folks uh start to
08:22 - learn those skills and then you'll see
08:24 - more jobs uh open up and hopefully in a
08:27 - postcode world you'll see even more of
08:29 - that opportunity to find different
08:31 - companies to work with but it's
08:33 - definitely an emerging technology at the
08:35 - moment yeah and that's kind of exciting
08:38 - too because you know one of the things
08:39 - that that can feel a little daunting
08:41 - especially for someone new in the
08:42 - industry is it feels like there are a
08:45 - whole lot of people looking for that
08:46 - first shot and not a lot of jobs and so
08:50 - so it sounds like there's an opportunity
08:51 - here where companies are just starting
08:54 - to adopt mixed reality so there's not
08:57 - there aren't a lot of people who could
08:58 - say that they are senior
09:01 - spatial computing engineers right
09:03 - nobody's been doing this for more than a
09:05 - year or two
09:06 - so
09:07 - that's it what a great opportunity to
09:09 - come in and be one of the first to yeah
09:11 - you know to be an expert before experts
09:14 - are really commonplace
09:16 - yeah and there's a lot of opportunity
09:18 - there and for the folks who
09:21 - have been working in the space um you
09:23 - know since the dawn of time they're all
09:25 - they're also really good resources uh
09:28 - for for learning and getting started
09:31 - it's just that the number of folks who
09:33 - have been doing it for years is
09:35 - significantly smaller than the folks who
09:37 - just started working in the space within
09:38 - the past like five years or so yeah yeah
09:41 - that is super exciting
09:43 - um yeah and so so i think like
09:46 - your your career is is fascinating to me
09:49 - because you've managed to get to this
09:51 - amazing job at one of the best known
09:53 - companies in the world you're working
09:54 - with this bleeding edge technology and
09:57 - in you know doing these really
09:58 - incredible groundbreaking things
10:00 - and you you come from a non-traditional
10:03 - background right like your your master's
10:05 - degree is in in luxury fashion right yep
10:08 - um so i would love to hear a little more
10:10 - about that story
10:11 - uh
10:12 - what kind of how did you end up going
10:15 - from
10:16 - working in luxury fashion to to just
10:18 - getting into tech at all
10:20 - yeah so like
10:22 - most folks in college um some of us have
10:26 - to work
10:27 - and so i took on a part-time job working
10:31 - in the luxury
10:32 - retail space because i figured i'm sorry
10:35 - that was my phone because i figured that
10:37 - if i am going to have to work now then i
10:39 - might as well do it somewhere that i
10:40 - like so yeah i started working in retail
10:42 - but at that point i didn't have any
10:44 - aspirations to work in fashion it was a
10:47 - way for me to make money and get
10:48 - discounts on clothes but as um retail
10:52 - has this thing where it kind of like
10:54 - sucks you in and you next thing you know
10:56 - you wake up and you've been there for
10:57 - like five years and that's what happened
10:59 - to me because over time i started to
11:01 - fall in love with it and i was working
11:04 - in menswear as well as visual
11:07 - merchandising
11:08 - and as time went on and i finally
11:11 - graduated from undergrad
11:13 - i started to more so have a reality
11:16 - check with my potential financial
11:18 - prospects of working in that space and
11:21 - how long it would realistically
11:22 - realistically take to get where i wanted
11:24 - to be
11:25 - and the fact of the matter is that
11:28 - either i wouldn't be making as much as i
11:31 - would prefer
11:32 - or it would take me just a very very
11:35 - long time to get to um to get to that
11:38 - level so i turned towards tech because i
11:41 - also had a certificate in business
11:43 - project management from undergrad
11:45 - and at the time i only thought of
11:47 - project management from a business
11:49 - perspective but when i was doing my job
11:51 - search everyone was asking for it
11:53 - experience and i'm like my professors
11:55 - never mentioned this at all
11:58 - so
11:59 - i
12:00 - felt a little discouraged because i said
12:02 - you know i'm not
12:03 - technology illiterate but it's also not
12:06 - something that i have on paper that i
12:07 - can take to um you know a recruiter or
12:10 - an employer and say look i understand
12:12 - computer so
12:16 - so um what i ended up doing was finding
12:19 - an internship and when
12:21 - i interviewed for that internship i made
12:24 - sure to mention how everything i had did
12:27 - in fashion
12:28 - um
12:29 - could be transferred over to the tech
12:31 - industry so having transferrable skills
12:34 - was definitely helpful
12:36 - and then during that very first
12:38 - interview for that internship with um
12:41 - the woman who became my manager
12:43 - i
12:44 - had
12:45 - made it very clear that i was also
12:48 - looking for something permanent and that
12:50 - this wasn't just like a six-month
12:52 - internship and then i go back to like
12:53 - living life i made it clear that you
12:56 - know i want a career and
12:58 - literally in i don't know
13:01 - five months of being in that four or
13:03 - five months of being in an internship i
13:05 - got a full-time offer
13:07 - and from there that's really where
13:09 - things kicked off but i did have a stint
13:12 - where i went back to fashion for a bit
13:15 - and
13:16 - i was also in the midst of completing my
13:19 - master's degree in luxury fashion
13:21 - management because i said uh i just want
13:23 - to work in fashion now
13:25 - reality hit
13:27 - and
13:28 - uh
13:28 - the same thing came back around for me
13:31 - whereas it was like oh that's his
13:33 - financial parts not going to be the best
13:35 - i took a massive pay cut when i left
13:37 - tech and went back to fashion
13:39 - and i got burnt out because i was
13:42 - working
13:43 - two jobs just to equate to the um income
13:47 - i had from when i was working in tech
13:49 - and it was literally this sort of
13:52 - schedule i would wake up early in the
13:54 - morning
13:55 - go to um i worked at club monaco and did
13:57 - visuals there go to club monaco do
13:59 - visuals and then from there um i would
14:02 - go to equinox because i managed the
14:04 - retail store at equinox and i would
14:06 - spend all day there and then um
14:10 - sometimes from there depending on the
14:12 - schedule i would go back to club monaco
14:15 - and work um you know there until the
14:17 - evening but it was always some sort of
14:19 - like rotation and then plus i was doing
14:22 - school so as you could imagine that um
14:26 - is a lot became overwhelmed
14:28 - i'm not the type that asked for
14:30 - financial help so it took a lot of um a
14:34 - lot of me to ask my parents at that time
14:36 - to help out so they started helping out
14:38 - but then i said okay i can't rely on
14:41 - anyone to pay any of my bills so i came
14:44 - back to tech
14:45 - [Laughter]
14:47 - and uh you know time went by
14:50 - i had different roles in tech and you
14:52 - know now today i'm here
14:55 - with microsoft so
14:57 - you know taking chances is one thing i'm
15:00 - a big fan of i've taken way too many
15:02 - chances but i feel like that's really a
15:05 - way for you to learn that
15:08 - you know which what isn't isn't going to
15:09 - work out yeah
15:11 - i mean it's so it's such a good point
15:12 - and i think that's like
15:14 - that willingness to to take risks and
15:17 - and be willing to to throw yourself all
15:19 - the way into something is it makes such
15:22 - a big difference yeah
15:23 - because you know if you only go halfway
15:25 - in then you're you're hedged and you
15:28 - can't like fully embrace something so i
15:30 - i i love to see
15:32 - when somebody's like i don't know if
15:33 - this is going to work but i'm going to
15:34 - try yeah and i like to tell folks i'm
15:37 - like i know some folks they're um
15:40 - they're hoping to transition into tech
15:42 - like now and i'm like i've done it twice
15:45 - so
15:47 - yeah so if i can do it then i feel like
15:50 - other people can also do it because i
15:52 - didn't have a technical background so i
15:53 - feel like others could also can also do
15:56 - it as well
15:57 - and you said something that i think is
15:59 - so so critical that i'd love to dig into
16:01 - a little bit more which is you you said
16:02 - when you were having that interview one
16:04 - of the things that you talked about was
16:05 - your transferable skills how all the
16:07 - things that you worked with in fashion
16:09 - were going to transfer into a job in
16:11 - tech yeah can you talk a little bit more
16:13 - about what some of those skills were and
16:16 - how they transferred
16:17 - yeah so the internship that i um
16:20 - received was in i.t project management
16:23 - ironically because i had no i.t
16:25 - experience but i had project management
16:27 - experience so during that interview i
16:29 - tied a lot of what i did as a visual
16:31 - merchandiser
16:33 - into managing a project because visual
16:35 - merchandising for those who don't know
16:37 - what that is it's um if you ever go into
16:40 - stores or look at the store windows and
16:42 - everything looks pretty and wonderful
16:44 - and all the shirts are folded perfectly
16:46 - and all the in-store displays are cool
16:47 - and awesome that's what i did so you
16:50 - don't just go right into it there's a
16:52 - plan as well that's involved and so it
16:55 - takes a lot of planning a lot of
16:56 - execution and a lot of that relates to
16:58 - project management so i tied in a lot of
17:01 - that aspect and then i also tied in my
17:04 - customer service skills as well which is
17:07 - also a really big one because as a
17:08 - project manager you're essentially the
17:11 - face of the project and you interface a
17:13 - lot with
17:14 - customers whether or stakeholders if you
17:16 - will whether they're internal or
17:18 - external so being able to work with
17:22 - various personalities being able to
17:25 - speak with folks who are higher than you
17:27 - in terms of the leadership skills if you
17:30 - will
17:31 - and just overall in general having
17:34 - communication skills was really big so
17:37 - um i feel like working in luxury fashion
17:39 - was probably like the best way to get
17:41 - that experience because everyone's
17:43 - privileged so working with the luxury
17:45 - audience is is um
17:47 - is it's very uh niche i would say
17:51 - and you you you really develop a way to
17:54 - uh communicate with folks so bringing
17:57 - those bringing those two areas of where
17:58 - i worked
18:00 - in was very very helpful with
18:02 - translating that to how i could relate
18:04 - that to working as a project manager
18:06 - even in the tech space yeah yeah and i
18:09 - think like it's so important to bring
18:11 - those sorts of things up because that
18:12 - what you talked about like how do you
18:14 - talk to somebody who's in a position of
18:15 - authority like that ability to manage up
18:18 - is so important and it's so easy you
18:21 - know for a lot of people i know who have
18:23 - worked in retail or they worked in
18:24 - restaurants you've developed that skill
18:26 - when you deal with an irate customer
18:29 - that's a valuable skill and if you just
18:31 - brush that off it's going oh well i just
18:32 - used to work in a restaurant
18:34 - you're selling yourself so short yeah
18:37 - yeah i mean like when people if you
18:38 - think about it how many hopefully people
18:40 - do is too often but like even at
18:42 - restaurants how many times have you gone
18:44 - in and just disliked something and
18:47 - wanted to like tell
18:49 - your your server like oh this was bad
18:52 - can you take it back like yeah that
18:54 - that's that's what we deal with for
18:56 - those of us who work in retail in the
18:57 - restaurant industry but
18:59 - over time you are you find a way to
19:02 - overcome those battles and i think it
19:05 - really does build a tough skin but it
19:06 - also
19:07 - um builds up your communication skills
19:09 - with people
19:11 - absolutely i think that's such a such a
19:14 - like
19:15 - incredible thing to just focus on like
19:17 - really really dig into what have you
19:20 - done in your previous role that that
19:21 - already prepared you for for what you're
19:23 - about to do yeah exactly um so on that
19:26 - on that like i feel like the dealing
19:28 - with with
19:30 - uh difficult people is is a is a pretty
19:34 - like headline banner kind of thing but
19:36 - one that i'd love to ask is like what's
19:38 - a skill that crossed over uh because i
19:40 - mean you've got you've got experience
19:42 - from like you you're you have one degree
19:45 - in public policy one degree in luxury
19:47 - fashion what do you what would you say
19:49 - is the the skill from a non-tech career
19:52 - or
19:53 - kind of experience that was most
19:55 - surprising that's been really useful to
19:57 - you in tech
20:00 - i would say there's two actually um
20:03 - because if you look at both degrees my
20:05 - first degree that i got from my
20:06 - bachelor's um
20:08 - it was uh international business well no
20:10 - no no global business and public policy
20:13 - which is international business
20:15 - so a lot of
20:17 - the
20:18 - um a lot of the knowledge that i
20:20 - acquired as it relates to the business
20:22 - um space and how you run a business that
20:25 - is actually
20:27 - very very huge um especially in the area
20:29 - that i work in within cloud advocacy
20:31 - because it's not just us creating videos
20:33 - or writing tutorials you have to truly
20:35 - understand the business needs and how
20:37 - what everything that you're doing rolls
20:39 - up into what the business goals are
20:42 - so
20:43 - i know with some folks it's a little
20:44 - harder to grasp that when they are
20:47 - starting within their first corporate
20:48 - role even for something such as like
20:51 - social media for example um you have to
20:54 - adhere to a voice and branding and
20:57 - guidelines when it's coming from like a
20:59 - corporate account for example what
21:01 - you're doing your personal life that's
21:02 - that but when you're doing something um
21:05 - in my case if i were to do something
21:06 - like a microsoft channel i need to
21:09 - ensure that i'm also in alignment with
21:11 - how the company
21:13 - presents itself so there's the business
21:15 - side and then for the um luxury and
21:19 - fashion management side that i have
21:21 - we had a period of time in our program
21:24 - where we had to end up learning like the
21:27 - adobe creative suite and
21:31 - branding as well so
21:33 - even though i hated working in adobe
21:36 - especially illustrator at that time
21:38 - it was one of those things that was
21:40 - really helpful nowadays also with
21:42 - branding because i mean i can't tell you
21:45 - like how many times i use um any of the
21:48 - creative cloud
21:50 - programs today literally before you and
21:52 - i started chatting today i was in
21:54 - premiere pro editing videos so a lot of
21:57 - what i learned in that grad program i'm
21:59 - doing today and then also from that
22:02 - branding aspect it's helped me um
22:05 - develop a way that i present myself
22:07 - um to the world that also
22:10 - prevent that prevents it also creates a
22:12 - sort of
22:13 - familiarity whenever you see something
22:16 - that i create and it's like it it's like
22:18 - you look you can look at it and say oh
22:20 - yeah april did that um i think that's
22:23 - also very very helpful um as you're also
22:26 - in your job search as well because it
22:29 - does create a sense of cohesion in uh
22:32 - the way you present what you're doing
22:33 - primarily if you're working in advocacy
22:36 - um i would say or like as like developer
22:38 - evangelism and things of that nature
22:41 - but yeah between having business acumen
22:44 - uh
22:45 - and knowing how to use creative tools
22:48 - and branding
22:49 - were like the like i said three things
22:51 - they're like the three things that um i
22:54 - would say i didn't expect to bring over
22:56 - into working in tech but they play a
22:58 - really big role in what i do today
23:00 - absolutely yeah i think that's the the
23:02 - idea of being able to bring
23:04 - a consistency to work i think is such a
23:08 - you can always feel it when somebody has
23:10 - a kind of a signature spin on the way
23:12 - that they present to the world
23:13 - and we don't always notice it we just
23:15 - can we just kind of in our the back of
23:17 - our heads we go oh yeah i recognize this
23:18 - work yeah um and so being able to create
23:22 - that field being able to create that
23:24 - consistency
23:25 - that's that's a superpower yeah it is it
23:28 - truly is
23:29 - and and like kind of on that note you
23:31 - you're
23:32 - kind of a polymath like in in the sense
23:34 - that you so you've got this this career
23:37 - tech uh career in tech where you're
23:39 - you're working in mixed reality you're
23:41 - kind of on on one bleeding edge there um
23:44 - you are also like to look at your social
23:46 - media you're doing so many things you
23:48 - you make your own clothing you you do
23:51 - photography you are writing books on
23:53 - python like you've got so much material
23:56 - in so many different directions
23:58 - um
24:00 - how do like i have two questions about
24:02 - this but the first one is how
24:04 - how do you approach learning so many
24:07 - different things yeah
24:09 - so
24:10 - i have a stem from my childhood my
24:13 - parents were the sort of parents that
24:15 - let me
24:16 - try and do whatever i want i didn't have
24:18 - any constraints over any of the
24:20 - activities that i wanted to try out i
24:22 - think that's very
24:24 - very very impactful as you get older at
24:27 - least for me as i got older and that
24:29 - carried over into my adulthood because i
24:31 - had so much freedom when i was younger
24:34 - and so now that i'm an adult
24:36 - whenever anything seems cool that i want
24:38 - to try out i carry that mentality of
24:41 - okay how do i get started to try it and
24:43 - you know not everything that i do i end
24:45 - up falling in love with but i can at
24:47 - least say i tried it so uh yeah for that
24:52 - i often get asked that question i'm like
24:54 - you can thank my parents for that
24:59 - cool so and then the the second question
25:00 - that i have is that you know i i think
25:02 - there's a lot of times a sense of
25:04 - pressure when you are on social media in
25:07 - tech to
25:08 - um you know you'll see people uh stick
25:11 - to tech and i so i'm personally very
25:13 - opposed to this but i i i love seeing
25:16 - that you bring your whole self into into
25:20 - your twitter profile and and so i'm
25:21 - curious how do you think that that has
25:23 - impacted your ability to grow in your
25:25 - career yeah
25:26 - so i will say to start off
25:29 - to not be your whole self is exhausting
25:32 - i don't know how people can have
25:34 - multiple uh
25:36 - internet versus real life personalities
25:39 - uh i think it's not worth
25:42 - doing that because it's tiring you know
25:45 - can you imagine if you had to be two
25:46 - people so um so for me i think it's very
25:51 - important that i do present all my
25:54 - interest in who i am because
25:56 - when it is time to uh move into a
25:59 - particular role for example assuming
26:01 - let's say
26:02 - that you know the team you work with
26:04 - they've been familiar with your uh you
26:06 - know your online content and your online
26:08 - presence but then if you start your
26:09 - first day at work and it's like who is
26:11 - this because they're not the same person
26:14 - right like that's a problem you know so
26:16 - i feel that
26:17 - for me to share
26:19 - um what i do online for me to interact
26:21 - with folks and engage with folks the way
26:23 - i do online
26:24 - when people do meet me in real life it's
26:27 - like oh it's the same person and it's
26:30 - that consistency across the board
26:32 - because
26:33 - i i again i don't have the time to
26:38 - switch personalities uh depending on the
26:40 - situation
26:41 - but i will say it's also been very
26:44 - helpful because it's also what
26:47 - people who um i've worked with as
26:49 - managers you know they expect and
26:51 - anticipate and they like it
26:52 - uh which is also really great as well
26:55 - i'm not asked to you know tone this down
26:57 - a little bit or you know we thought that
27:00 - you know you would do it like this but
27:02 - we're not really seeing that it's like
27:04 - i've gotten hired in both of my roles at
27:06 - microsoft because working in mixed
27:07 - reality is my second role at microsoft i
27:09 - got hired in both roles with the
27:11 - expectancy to bring who i already was to
27:14 - the space that i was working in so yeah
27:16 - i would say it's definitely worked in my
27:18 - favor that is i i think that's such an
27:20 - important thing too because you know the
27:22 - the fact that you got brought in
27:24 - because of who you present online that's
27:27 - a differentiator you know if we're
27:29 - looking at five people with with an
27:31 - identical resume
27:33 - um
27:34 - the thing that we're going to make a
27:35 - decision on is is which person looks
27:37 - like they're going to make a bigger
27:38 - impact and if you can see the whole
27:40 - person
27:41 - then you can better assess that impact
27:43 - and so
27:44 - three people have edited themselves down
27:45 - to just their tech chops and you know
27:48 - one person is being an entire person i'm
27:50 - immediately more
27:52 - uh interested in talking to the person
27:54 - who who isn't just going to argue with
27:56 - me about whether or not we should use
27:58 - you know semicolons or not
28:00 - you're about
28:01 - [Laughter]
28:06 - um but yeah so i think i i like i i love
28:09 - this so we've got a couple questions
28:10 - coming in from the chat that i'd love to
28:12 - ask uh
28:13 - somebody has asked what kind of schedule
28:15 - do you follow uh on like a day-to-day
28:18 - or do you follow a schedule
28:20 - um i am a highly
28:23 - organized scheduled person because if
28:26 - i don't have a schedule
28:28 - things
28:29 - are forgotten and i always say if it's
28:30 - not on my calendar i don't know about it
28:33 - um
28:34 - i will like preface this and say i did
28:36 - at one point in life try to not be so
28:40 - scheduled and everything fell into
28:42 - shambles so um i've definitely
28:45 - re-adopted um organizing everything and
28:47 - a typical day for me if we're talking
28:49 - about super typical
28:51 - um i wake up i sit on instagram and
28:54 - twitter for about
28:56 - let's say i wake up around like usually
28:57 - six that's just my internal clock sit on
28:59 - instagram and twitter until about 8 30 i
29:02 - know that's bad
29:03 - and then from there i get up shower it's
29:06 - nine o'clock my day starts at nine i
29:08 - don't prefer like i don't prefer and i
29:10 - usually don't take meetings before nine
29:13 - and um depending on what the day is
29:16 - usually i'm working on content so some
29:18 - days i'm writing tutorials uh this week
29:21 - uh yesterday for example i even tweeted
29:23 - that i was recording like 14 videos over
29:25 - the span of the entire day so um you
29:28 - know one day might just be all recording
29:30 - videos another might be all focused on
29:32 - editing videos like that's what i'm
29:34 - working on today
29:35 - and i
29:37 - like to just really focus on one thing
29:39 - um in one day of course sometimes i'll
29:42 - need to uh
29:44 - to do a little do multiple things in a
29:45 - day and of course there's meetings as
29:47 - well but i try to minimize when i'm
29:49 - working on for work uh each day so that
29:52 - way i'm not like switching gears every
29:54 - so often and just in like you know this
29:56 - eight hour work day yeah after that um
30:00 - it also depends on the day it is since
30:02 - i'm writing a second book now sometimes
30:05 - i just focus on that but for the
30:07 - weekends i don't do anything work
30:09 - related i don't do anything tech related
30:12 - unless it's like for my book of course
30:14 - but
30:14 - usually that's when i sew i do any sort
30:16 - of crafting um
30:18 - [Music]
30:19 - prior to these times i would go out and
30:23 - hang out around la
30:25 - but uh that's really how my life is run
30:29 - yeah yeah i can i mean i i love the
30:32 - honesty of that answer of like you know
30:34 - spending time on social media in the
30:36 - morning i feel like a lot of people just
30:37 - skip that part right and and i mean i'm
30:40 - the same way you know i i wake up early
30:41 - and then i the first thing i roll over
30:43 - and i grab my phone and then i just look
30:44 - at twitter
30:46 - i'm there between that and youtube
30:48 - videos because also i don't spend all
30:51 - day during like the day on social media
30:54 - i know some folks um you know it's a
30:56 - comfort zone for them while they're
30:57 - working but for me once that nine
31:00 - o'clock hour hits in the morning
31:03 - i might hop on twitter
31:05 - for like a scrolling session of maybe
31:08 - three tweets or to respond to any like
31:10 - notifications and then i'm right off of
31:12 - it so that little period that i have in
31:14 - the morning of instagram twitter and uh
31:19 - and youtube that's really the extent of
31:21 - my like social media um engagement for
31:25 - the day now that's that's probably i
31:27 - find that if i'm disciplined i do the
31:29 - same but when i'm not disciplined i'll
31:31 - i'll like have it open in another tab
31:33 - and it just tanks my productivity
31:35 - because i every time i get even a little
31:37 - bit bored i'm like maybe i'll just
31:38 - scroll for a minute and then i get
31:40 - nothing don't do it
31:44 - um so another another question from uh
31:47 - arjeets is
31:48 - is a degree important for a job or is
31:51 - skill enough to get a job in a big
31:54 - company so i feel like we we
31:56 - this is actually a great question
31:58 - because did your degrees play a factor
32:01 - in you getting your your microsoft job
32:03 - even though they weren't
32:04 - cs degrees
32:06 - no
32:07 - not at all um
32:09 - but what i will say when people ask this
32:11 - question is it highly depends on the
32:13 - company that you're applying to because
32:15 - there's no one answer for every single
32:18 - company in tech that is something that i
32:20 - would highly suggest you do as much
32:22 - research um in as you possibly can
32:26 - when you're in that applying uh phase
32:28 - for a job now for my particular roles
32:31 - that i've had at microsoft i'm not sure
32:34 - 100 sure if either my degrees were
32:36 - evaluated however there was more so a
32:39 - heavy and
32:40 - a heavy emphasis
32:42 - on my project management background
32:44 - which was experience so i worked in the
32:47 - project management space for
32:50 - five six years before i came to
32:52 - microsoft so um you know i definitely
32:54 - had the experience
32:56 - in that and then coming into cloud
32:58 - advocacy um a lot of it was focused
33:01 - around my
33:03 - creating content um while creating
33:05 - content abilities and then realistically
33:07 - when i came into the um xr space
33:10 - by that point only had six months of
33:13 - working in anything mixed reality in my
33:15 - own free time so it wasn't as though i
33:18 - had you know massive big projects and
33:21 - you know i've deployed this to this
33:23 - platform and then i've had 80 million
33:25 - people do it like no i didn't have any
33:26 - of that and i also didn't have a degree
33:28 - in it as well so a lot of it was
33:31 - learning once i got hired but
33:34 - you know when people are looking for um
33:36 - for for potential hires
33:38 - it comes down to what that role entails
33:42 - and what the job description is so for
33:44 - me working in uh advocacy
33:47 - um it's it's that engagement with the
33:50 - community can you build a community
33:53 - can you um
33:55 - engage a community but then there's also
33:58 - that technical part too because the only
34:00 - way i can talk to community is by
34:02 - understanding the tech right so uh you
34:04 - know coming into mr i mean i had a
34:07 - python background but i didn't have a
34:09 - c-sharp so um you know i had that drive
34:13 - on my own for six months to learn
34:16 - everything before coming into space and
34:19 - by that point my now manager we had
34:21 - already connected in real life um
34:24 - as well as my skip manager who was his
34:26 - manager so
34:28 - since i'm very open about my learning
34:30 - you know they always saw what i was
34:32 - working on in learning so when it came
34:34 - time to do this internal transition at
34:37 - microsoft
34:39 - there there was
34:40 - essentially you know there was no need
34:42 - to bring up this portfolio of projects
34:44 - because they now have seen six months of
34:47 - me actually doing stuff so they didn't
34:50 - have to go you know find any of it
34:52 - because it was just there
34:54 - so
34:55 - so what you're bringing up i think is is
34:57 - such a like
34:59 - a fantastically important point whether
35:01 - you're doing it internally like you did
35:03 - or externally like um you know we see we
35:06 - see folks uh tweet about their learning
35:08 - journeys the 100 days of code people on
35:11 - free code cam sharing as they learn all
35:13 - these different processes to to not only
35:16 - try to learn something new but to share
35:19 - what you're learning as you learn it and
35:22 - you know as you just said that makes
35:23 - such a big impact on your ability to get
35:25 - that opportunity yeah
35:27 - because i think something that that is
35:29 - really important about your story of
35:30 - getting into mixed reality is that you
35:33 - you got there
35:35 - without a degree
35:37 - and without experience so what you got
35:40 - that job on
35:41 - was
35:42 - proving your willingness to do the work
35:45 - yeah and i feel like that is one of the
35:47 - most valuable things
35:49 - like you know i know you weren't going
35:50 - in as a junior but for all the people
35:52 - who are looking for their first role in
35:54 - tech sorry give me one second someone
35:55 - ring the doorbell oh
35:58 - um just because i don't have to get up
36:00 - one second let me check the ring sure
36:03 - uh but for you know for everybody
36:05 - watching here you know the the
36:07 - if you don't have the opportunity to to
36:10 - show a resume that has a bunch of work
36:12 - on it if you if you don't have years of
36:15 - experience to support your your lack of
36:17 - a resume then you have the ability
36:19 - instead to to demonstrate this work in
36:21 - public to show this drive you're doing
36:23 - the work you're showing up repeatedly
36:26 - you're willing to make that effort and
36:28 - that is a huge differentiator yeah it
36:30 - does make a difference and i would say a
36:33 - lot of what i've experienced
36:35 - um definitely heavily ties to working in
36:39 - uh evangelism if you will because it is
36:41 - a very public role
36:43 - you're you're very often in front of
36:45 - people so
36:46 - uh
36:48 - it's something whereas
36:51 - if that's the sort of area that you want
36:52 - to work in there needs to be that social
36:56 - aspect to it that ability to feel
36:57 - comfortable speaking with folks and it's
36:59 - not always speaking to like huge
37:00 - audiences it can be really as small as
37:03 - like a meet up or you know if you have a
37:06 - if you have
37:07 - any sort of like group that you know you
37:10 - present to maybe like 20 people every so
37:12 - often like it doesn't have to be some
37:14 - massive audience that you have but it is
37:16 - that comfort and ability to um to to put
37:19 - yourself in front of folks and to help
37:22 - share um knowledge with others because
37:24 - for me
37:25 - in the area that i work in like we don't
37:27 - sell products um within cloud advocacy
37:30 - sure but we do expose people to
37:33 - technology and uh that's why for me uh
37:38 - you know living out loud online and what
37:40 - i was doing what i'm doing in tech it
37:42 - really played a big role in uh me
37:44 - getting to where i am now in cloud
37:46 - advocacy mm-hmm yeah i think that's a
37:49 - that's like a just a great
37:51 - it's a great outlook
37:53 - um
37:54 - so i think one one other question that i
37:56 - have is is to kind of turn around all of
37:58 - your experience and let's talk to the
38:00 - the people watching right now because i
38:01 - think a lot of them are in the free code
38:03 - camp program and and looking for that
38:05 - first opportunity so we talked about
38:07 - social media presence bring your whole
38:09 - self be a full person we talked about
38:11 - the learning in public show your work
38:14 - um
38:15 - what other tips would you have for
38:16 - somebody who's looking for that first
38:18 - opportunity how can they stand out if
38:20 - there are a lot of people applying for
38:22 - that same role
38:23 - networking
38:26 - networking is how i got my my very first
38:29 - role at microsoft
38:31 - i didn't cold apply
38:32 - and i know for some folks
38:34 - cold applying which cold applying is
38:37 - when you apply to a position without any
38:41 - sort of connection or referral to anyone
38:43 - in that company
38:44 - and i've done code for applying many
38:47 - times in my um in the years i've worked
38:50 - in tech but i've always found that
38:52 - networking to be
38:53 - the most beneficial and i've also found
38:56 - it to be one of the
38:58 - quicker
38:59 - ways for me to find employment
39:02 - but with networking it's a two-way
39:05 - relationship you do have to understand
39:07 - that and you also
39:09 - should not be in a position just to use
39:11 - someone because they work at xyz company
39:13 - i would highly suggest developing some
39:15 - sort of relationship with the person
39:17 - first yeah and um and then from there i
39:21 - would say
39:22 - if it feels right and if you're
39:23 - comfortable and if you're applying to
39:26 - let's say a role with their company
39:28 - at that point i think it's okay to to
39:31 - reach out from a hey i want to apply to
39:34 - this can you tell me more about working
39:36 - with the company so on and so forth
39:38 - usually mostly if you start the
39:40 - conversation like that it'll probably
39:42 - end in the person themselves asking do
39:44 - you want a referral um if the
39:46 - conversation doesn't quite go that way
39:48 - after a continued conversation about the
39:50 - company
39:51 - feel free to ask i mean does it hurt to
39:53 - ask but i also feel like that should not
39:56 - be the very first thing you do upon
39:57 - meeting someone is asking like hey can't
39:59 - get me a job um at xyz company so
40:02 - networking is great um and it doesn't it
40:05 - isn't something that's also um
40:08 - instant gratification either i've known
40:10 - people that you know i've known for
40:12 - years and
40:14 - a um there there wasn't a need to
40:17 - potentially ask for help on anything
40:19 - career related until like years later
40:21 - for example
40:22 - so it's something where you really want
40:24 - to foster that relationship don't just
40:27 - forget about the person you know
40:29 - after 10 minutes of having a
40:31 - conversation with them at a conference
40:32 - for example like continue there check in
40:34 - on them
40:36 - um chat without really anything but
40:39 - having that relationship first before
40:41 - having that
40:43 - need to ask for something is super
40:45 - crucial
40:46 - and
40:47 - networking also helps with you know
40:50 - getting that resume on top of the other
40:52 - resumes in the pile
40:54 - as well um but also recognize that it's
40:56 - not always a guarantee that you're going
40:58 - to be hired you know i've um when i was
41:01 - looking for my first role at microsoft i
41:03 - interviewed with a couple other
41:04 - companies and they were all
41:07 - from networking opportunities which you
41:09 - know i never applied to any company
41:11 - either in that time it was more so i
41:13 - connected with folks online
41:15 - and um you know they were kind enough to
41:18 - refer me for interview and i had
41:20 - interviews and this was like pre where
41:23 - i'm at now times like i didn't have like
41:25 - the 22
41:27 - k followers that i had now i was still
41:29 - in like smaller numbers so it wasn't a
41:31 - matter of being some like big known
41:33 - person it was just connecting with the
41:35 - right people and um
41:37 - that's i think that's like a really
41:39 - great way to bump up your resume um i
41:42 - know that everyone's comfortable doing
41:44 - that completely understand
41:46 - so if that's the case i would say
41:49 - anytime companies hold any type of um
41:53 - events or workshops where you actually
41:55 - have the chance to speak with people who
41:56 - work at the companies that's a great
41:58 - opportunity to learn more about what's
42:00 - available and then hopefully um you know
42:02 - get to know someone that way
42:05 - and uh if
42:07 - if communicating engaging with others
42:08 - just 100 not your thing because you're
42:11 - not comfortable doing that
42:13 - i will say you you will definitely need
42:15 - most likely a strong portfolio to help
42:19 - you um really get noticed and even with
42:21 - that
42:23 - make sure whatever you're presenting
42:24 - your portfolio is something that you
42:26 - would feel comfort that you would feel
42:28 - 100 proud of if you had to present it to
42:31 - like a ceo for example right it needs to
42:34 - be something
42:35 - that is uh it doesn't have to be 100
42:38 - fully polished and deployed somewhere
42:40 - that people are downloading it's great
42:42 - if it is but it needs to be something
42:43 - that's polished um and relatable uh even
42:47 - to what the company does as well because
42:49 - it then puts the hiring manager in that
42:52 - mindset of okay they already don't work
42:54 - in this particular area so that learning
42:57 - curve would be super low so yeah let's
43:00 - bring them in so hopefully that tackles
43:02 - for the people who are super social and
43:03 - then people who are not as
43:05 - social
43:06 - and i think like you know you you bring
43:08 - up a lot of really really good points
43:09 - here so so one that i uh just to to
43:12 - repeat like networking is a long game
43:15 - it's it's not something that you're
43:16 - going to say oh i want a job next week
43:18 - let me start networking today yes yeah
43:21 - think of it more like building
43:22 - friendships right like you're trying to
43:24 - make connections to people not because
43:26 - you want stuff from them right because
43:28 - it's good to have friends and then yeah
43:31 - having more friends means later there's
43:33 - a decent chance you know somebody who
43:34 - knows somebody who can get you that
43:36 - intro and so it's not a transactional
43:39 - thing it's it's making your life better
43:42 - you're you're finding people who have
43:43 - similar interests that you like talking
43:45 - to
43:46 - um and uh so peanut butter in the chat
43:50 - has a great question
43:52 - [Applause]
43:54 - it's a great name
43:55 - uh but they ask how are you connecting
43:58 - with others online like especially now
44:00 - given that we're in
44:02 - covid times we're not getting the
44:03 - opportunities where we could show up at
44:06 - a conference or a meet-up and they're
44:07 - kind of the casual coffee chats so
44:10 - if you're shy if you're not super
44:12 - comfortable just like blasting into
44:13 - somebody's dms and being like hey i'm
44:15 - jason
44:16 - um
44:17 - where where would you recommend going
44:19 - like what are the strategies that you're
44:20 - using to to meet people yeah so um
44:24 - i will say i'm usually everywhere so i
44:26 - don't want to give
44:27 - like 100 that response but
44:30 - um i can give that after after i talk
44:32 - about for folks who aren't as social
44:34 - first so i will i will help those people
44:36 - out first
44:37 - there are significantly smaller
44:39 - communities that you can take part in
44:41 - whether it's on discord for example um
44:44 - there's slack and i will say most likely
44:47 - regardless of the area in tech that you
44:49 - work in or um
44:51 - pursue to work in there's some small
44:54 - community somewhere and one of these
44:56 - chatting platforms that isn't
44:57 - necessarily twitter that you can take
44:59 - part in and
45:01 - typically those are what i like to call
45:03 - safe spaces for um the area of tech
45:06 - where it's okay to ask questions it's
45:08 - okay
45:08 - to um to really bring that beginner
45:11 - mentality there and then you start to
45:12 - get more comfortable hopefully with
45:14 - people so if you're not into like the
45:16 - really big groups of um engagement folks
45:19 - there's that which i find to be um you
45:22 - know definitely helpful for for those
45:25 - who who don't want to be in that
45:27 - one-on-one conversation with someone it
45:29 - really becomes um you know like a group
45:31 - conversation at that point so it doesn't
45:34 - it doesn't feel as awkward sliding into
45:36 - someone dms and having this like
45:38 - one-to-one conversation yeah so there's
45:40 - that
45:41 - um for for those though who you know who
45:44 - do want to be everywhere i would say
45:47 - for me because i do work in the xr space
45:50 - alt space vr has been um a place where
45:53 - i've met folks i've i've gone to both
45:56 - large and small events in
45:58 - alt space and
46:00 - i would say
46:02 - usually when i've gone to set events
46:04 - it's probably because i did some talk of
46:06 - some sort so i end up chatting with
46:09 - people afterwards because they have
46:10 - questions so there's that
46:12 - but for the larger alt-space um you know
46:15 - hangouts where i didn't do any sort of
46:17 - presenting
46:18 - um you know people people literally they
46:21 - will come up and talk to you um as well
46:24 - and it's one of those things where you
46:26 - see a group of people talking just hover
46:28 - over there
46:30 - and see what's going on and you know say
46:32 - stuff so that's another way i've got to
46:34 - meet people
46:35 - um
46:35 - twitch has been another way as well when
46:38 - i was streaming um because it's so
46:40 - public anybody hops into the chat and
46:42 - then you start getting used to seeing
46:44 - the same people there
46:46 - and then finally there's twitter um
46:48 - whether it's a conversation that people
46:50 - are having around tech or around
46:52 - something like silly or something you
46:55 - know that's a serious topic that's an
46:57 - opportunity to start speaking with folks
46:59 - and you can continue to start speaking
47:02 - with people um
47:03 - and even like uh like chloe for example
47:06 - i mean i met her definitely before covet
47:08 - but we met on twitter and like we're
47:11 - best friends now so
47:12 - it's it's there's opportunity in a lot
47:14 - of social areas to meet folks whether
47:17 - that's
47:18 - um with large
47:20 - online gatherings or even smaller and
47:23 - intimate
47:24 - yeah i i think some of the ones that
47:26 - i've seen um are like discord there are
47:29 - a lot of small community discords
47:31 - popping up around different interest
47:33 - groups and so if you know
47:35 - i i personally i'm a big fan of of just
47:38 - being part of conversations like on
47:40 - twitter it's really low stakes to to
47:43 - reply don't
47:44 - spam replies but like if somebody says
47:46 - something and it's something that you're
47:48 - working on or that you're interested in
47:50 - respond like we that that's why you know
47:52 - we're on twitter twitter is not a
47:54 - broadcast only medium it's a discussion
47:55 - medium um but if you're worried about
47:57 - twitter
47:58 - there are discords that are much much
48:00 - much smaller groups and a lot of them
48:03 - operate with really strict uh codes of
48:05 - conduct so that they are
48:07 - they're not only like safe spaces in the
48:09 - sense that everybody's talking about the
48:10 - same things but there's safe spaces in
48:12 - the sense that you will get bounced if
48:14 - you're out of line yep you will
48:15 - definitely be put out
48:17 - and that's that is also really really
48:19 - important because then you can go in and
48:21 - know that you know nobody's going to
48:22 - nobody's going to come down on you
48:24 - nobody's going to go after you it's a
48:25 - place where people who are interested in
48:27 - things want to talk yeah even like um
48:30 - just brought up one and i've been
48:31 - slacking on being as active on there
48:34 - just from life but even like dev2 for
48:36 - example with that platform um
48:39 - i'm a moderator on there and i've like
48:42 - seen different like moderator chats and
48:44 - like it's like a serious thing like you
48:46 - just can't come on there and harass
48:48 - people and you know be this big like
48:51 - bully like that's just not allowed
48:54 - so um i feel like it's it's definitely
48:56 - more comfortable for folks who are
48:58 - trying to find
48:59 - um you know that place where they can
49:01 - fit in and feel comfortable
49:04 - absolutely yeah i think that is that is
49:06 - absolutely fantastic and it kind of
49:08 - plays into you know there's a follow-up
49:10 - question from uh newcomb i hope i just
49:13 - said your name right i'm sorry if i
49:14 - didn't uh about um how to make a
49:17 - reputation for yourself
49:19 - and and so
49:21 - what we've talked about with networking
49:23 - there's a there seems to be a point in
49:25 - in my experience at least where somebody
49:28 - goes from being someone i've never heard
49:29 - of
49:30 - to being a name i've i've kind of heard
49:33 - suddenly to being someone that i
49:34 - recognize yeah
49:36 - you know and and i think that like there
49:37 - are some some really notable stories you
49:39 - mentioned chloe chloe is a great example
49:41 - of this where i feel like three years
49:43 - ago i i don't know that i'd ever met or
49:45 - heard of chloe and now yeah she's she's
49:47 - doing these amazing things she was just
49:49 - interviewing bill nye like i was there
49:51 - too oh my god
49:54 - what an amazing thing that was right
49:57 - like yeah and and it's um and and all of
49:59 - that
50:00 - kind of
50:01 - builds this reputation so
50:04 - what do you where do you think that line
50:05 - is and how do you move from from
50:07 - networking to to building a reputation
50:10 - so i will first start by saying be
50:13 - mindful that there's two type of
50:15 - reputations there's a good reputation
50:17 - and a bad reputation
50:19 - and
50:20 - it is very easy i will say to build a
50:22 - bad reputation depending on um just the
50:26 - way things play out in um i'll say like
50:29 - the online space for example
50:32 - but
50:33 - there's also the good reputation side of
50:36 - it as well um
50:38 - but to build i won't talk about how to
50:40 - build a bad reputation because i won't
50:41 - help anyone here but to build a good
50:43 - reputation
50:45 - um
50:47 - a lot of it comes down
50:49 - to
50:50 - uh
50:52 - what are you doing in the community you
50:54 - know what are you doing in the tech
50:56 - space
50:57 - and
50:58 - you know are you using your skills for
51:00 - for social good for example um are you
51:05 - are you able to or are you engaging in
51:08 - topics that impact us like when i say us
51:11 - i mean everyone who works in tech for
51:13 - example
51:15 - um are are you doing
51:17 - things with your skill sets
51:20 - that um are helping other people grow
51:22 - for example and then like once you make
51:24 - it in tech are you doing things to help
51:27 - you know uplift others and bring others
51:29 - along with you in that journey
51:31 - so it's not like you must do this only
51:34 - one thing and now you have reputation
51:35 - for yourself it's i think a really a
51:37 - combination of things but
51:40 - um if if you come to notice the people
51:42 - who have good reputations uh in this in
51:45 - this industry
51:47 - they're most likely folks who are
51:49 - doing things to help others
51:51 - realistically um
51:53 - i mean i could probably give you a
51:54 - laundry list of things that people are
51:55 - doing
51:56 - but it's really folks who are doing
51:58 - things to help others along either in
52:01 - their journey or
52:03 - as i hate to say this phrase but making
52:04 - the world a better place so
52:07 - i mean i i'm fully on board with you for
52:09 - that and i think like
52:11 - a way that it differentiates in my head
52:12 - is that you know networking is an active
52:14 - activity you are participating in
52:16 - networking i'm reaching out to you i'm
52:18 - talking in a community reputation is
52:21 - what happens when you're not there what
52:22 - do people say when your name comes up in
52:24 - conversation does your name come up in
52:26 - conversation um and and i think that
52:29 - that reputation gets built on
52:31 - how people feel
52:32 - when you are networking if i if i come
52:35 - into a conversation and and i can manage
52:38 - to do something that makes you feel
52:40 - better
52:41 - then later if my name comes up
52:45 - you're going to remember that our our
52:46 - interaction was good it was a positive
52:49 - outcome and then you're going to say oh
52:50 - i like them they they were helpful
52:53 - um and if our interaction wasn't good
52:55 - then the opposite happens yeah and
52:57 - we're never going to get all good or all
52:59 - bad like it's always going to be a blend
53:01 - but we can always try to make sure that
53:02 - we're trending toward better how can we
53:05 - think about the way that an interaction
53:06 - we're about to have is going to make the
53:08 - people on the other end of that
53:09 - conversation feel are we making people
53:12 - feel
53:12 - smart capable like they're going to get
53:14 - somewhere or are we trying to make
53:16 - ourselves feel smart and make them feel
53:18 - small those are all going to influence
53:20 - your reputation and
53:22 - you know people talk about that you if
53:23 - you are present in a community people
53:25 - will talk about you when you're not
53:26 - there and you want to make sure that
53:28 - that's positive that yeah
53:31 - and i would say even like especially
53:33 - within the tech area because it's just
53:34 - so many things happen
53:36 - um
53:37 - even folks who are
53:39 - um you know controversial and things
53:42 - that they share
53:44 - um you know being controversial honestly
53:46 - can have a negative or a positive
53:48 - connotation and um you know it could be
53:52 - statements expressed that are
53:54 - controversial to one audience um but
53:56 - they're things that they're statements
53:58 - that help people in the long run or it
54:01 - could be uh controversial things said
54:03 - that are super negative which i'm sure a
54:05 - lot of us see on twitter as well so um
54:08 - you know i i say that because it doesn't
54:11 - mean you have to be this bubbly
54:13 - um you know happy-go-lucky percy person
54:15 - 24 7 for example um i don't even think
54:18 - that's like a thing that is like
54:20 - realistic or authentic or human
54:23 - but uh you know you can you can speak up
54:27 - um
54:28 - as well uh on on on topics especially if
54:31 - you feel very strong about something but
54:33 - uh just also do keep in mind that
54:37 - how it's perceived by people it's going
54:39 - to vary um you'll have people who love
54:41 - that you said certain things and you'll
54:43 - have obsess a subset of people that's
54:45 - just like oh no i don't like that they
54:48 - said this blah blah blah blah so it
54:51 - really goes
54:52 - both ways um
54:55 - but that also feeds into reputation as
54:57 - well
54:58 - yeah absolutely i think that's that's an
55:00 - excellent point um so we're we're kind
