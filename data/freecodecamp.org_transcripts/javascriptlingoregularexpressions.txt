00:00 - in this video we're going to talk about
00:02 - regular Expressions also known as regex
00:05 - regex has a really different format than
00:08 - everything else in JavaScript so it has
00:09 - kind of a steep learning curve and can
00:11 - be a little bit intimidating personally
00:13 - I'm very intimidated by regx though I
00:15 - know it can be a very useful tool and
00:16 - I've used it a lot
00:18 - successfully what you can do with regx
00:21 - is match replace search and split
00:24 - strings which can be one of the most
00:26 - difficult forms of data to manipulate in
00:28 - JavaScript the times this be useful if
00:31 - you have a website and you want users to
00:33 - create a password and you want their
00:35 - password to have at least one number and
00:37 - at least one capital letter you can use
00:39 - regex to make sure that their entry
00:41 - matches those qualifications for it to
00:43 - be valid there's like I said a lot of
00:46 - ways to use regex but the most common is
00:48 - when you're validating user inputed
00:50 - information I want you to remember this
00:53 - because when you get to the regx
00:54 - challenges don't worry it's going to be
00:56 - okay I know it looks really different
00:59 - and also if you're ever trying to do
01:00 - something like validate user information
01:02 - on your website or your web page or your
01:04 - bonfire whatever think about rigex
01:07 - because it might be a really efficient
01:08 - way to do what you're trying to do
