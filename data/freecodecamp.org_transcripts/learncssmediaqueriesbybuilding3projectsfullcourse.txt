00:00 - understanding css media queries is
00:02 - essential if you're going to create
00:03 - responsive websites
00:05 - joy does an excellent job explaining how
00:07 - they work in this comprehensive course
00:10 - hey guys joy here in this video we're
00:12 - gonna learn css media queries and we're
00:14 - gonna also build three practical
00:15 - projects so let's go
00:17 - okay the first question is what are css
00:19 - media queries and why should you even
00:21 - care if you want to make responsive
00:23 - websites like this you can see that this
00:25 - is the desktop version and this is the
00:27 - mobile version for the same website you
00:29 - might be in situations where you have to
00:31 - design four different version of the
00:33 - same website one for the tablet one for
00:35 - the desktop one for the laptop and
00:38 - another one for the mobile version so
00:40 - these are all possible using css media
00:42 - queries and you should definitely learn
00:44 - it so we're building this website on
00:46 - project two on the third project we're
00:48 - gonna be building this so this is the
00:49 - mobile version and this is the desktop
00:51 - version
00:52 - and we're gonna build this on the first
00:54 - project you can see that when we drag
00:56 - the window over here you can see that
00:58 - our numbers i mean the width of our
01:00 - window changes live like this and also
01:03 - the color of the background changes
01:05 - depending on the breakpoints we have
01:07 - defined on our media queries don't worry
01:10 - we're going to discuss that also
01:12 - so at the bottom we can see that we have
01:14 - define our breakpoints over here and
01:16 - depending on that our colors will change
01:19 - so we're going to learn first of all
01:21 - little bit and then write little bit of
01:23 - code so little bit of learning little
01:25 - bit of doing
01:27 - by the way i have an entire article on
01:29 - css media queries through illustrations
01:31 - i beautifully explain each and every
01:33 - aspect of css media queries so that you
01:35 - can either revise or learn media 4 is
01:38 - very easily quickly and efficiently if
01:41 - you're new to the channel feel free to
01:42 - subscribe because i post videos based on
01:44 - practical wave projects so that you can
01:46 - level up your coding skills if that's so
01:48 - interesting hit the subscribe button and
01:50 - join my gang and without further ado
01:52 - let's get started
01:54 - all right boys and girls before coding
01:56 - first of all we need to set up our
01:57 - environment to do that come to the
01:59 - window over here right click create a
02:02 - new folder okay and then name it
02:03 - anything you wish i'm gonna name it
02:05 - project one
02:07 - project one like this and then i'm gonna
02:09 - open it on
02:11 - vs code right click and you're gonna get
02:13 - this option of open with vs code if you
02:16 - don't get it what you're gonna do is
02:17 - you're gonna open a vs code
02:21 - then you're gonna click this file option
02:23 - over here and then open folder
02:28 - okay so come to the desktop and then you
02:30 - can see the project one over here select
02:33 - folder
02:35 - and now we can see that it has opened
02:37 - our folder over here click this plus
02:39 - sign
02:40 - and write index.html
02:46 - okay and then
02:47 - for this project we're gonna use sas not
02:49 - css because it is more powerful and it
02:52 - has more options than regular css even
02:55 - if you're a beginner start learning sas
02:57 - along with css because it's going to be
02:59 - very handy and it's going to
03:01 - save you a lot of time so click this
03:03 - icon again and write style
03:06 - dot s-c-s-s
03:08 - okay and then we're gonna create for
03:11 - another file named main.js
03:14 - main.js the main purpose of creating
03:17 - this javascript file is that um
03:20 - if you come back over here you can see
03:22 - that this is loading live okay so if i
03:25 - resize the window you can see the value
03:27 - live for this we're gonna use javascript
03:30 - so don't worry about it it's very little
03:32 - javascript on project two we're gonna
03:34 - learn how we can make responsive images
03:37 - along with our responsive website so for
03:39 - that you need to download some images
03:41 - the images are on my github repository
03:43 - the link of the github repository is
03:45 - given in the description down below so
03:47 - once you click on the link you're gonna
03:48 - copy the link from here control c and
03:51 - then if you scroll down you're gonna
03:53 - find these steps or you can follow along
03:55 - with me you click on down get you go
03:58 - there and
04:01 - you paste the link that you copied
04:02 - earlier over here and you click this
04:04 - download option and it's gonna create
04:07 - the folder why are we doing this that's
04:10 - because github doesn't have a direct
04:12 - download link let me show you if i go
04:14 - back you can see that we don't have a
04:16 - download option over here
04:18 - all right so now you're going to drag
04:20 - this outside
04:22 - it is actually a zip file so media query
04:25 - project is the name of the folder over
04:27 - here it contains uh five images
04:31 - okay so once that's done you're gonna
04:34 - rename the folder and name it to
04:37 - uh images wait if you rename
04:40 - if you click on here or you can also
04:43 - click f2 to rename the file i mean
04:46 - folder so you're gonna write images like
04:49 - this and now what you can do is you can
04:51 - either drag this inside or you open vs
04:55 - code over here
04:56 - and then
04:58 - you drag the images folder over here to
05:01 - copy it
05:02 - so
05:03 - now you're gonna click copy folder like
05:05 - this and now your project folder should
05:07 - look like this
05:08 - okay and now you write this sign and
05:11 - then hit tab
05:13 - this is emmet if emma doesn't work for
05:15 - you search google why emmett is not
05:18 - working on vs code you're gonna find
05:20 - appropriate solutions now what you're
05:22 - gonna do is you're gonna link the sas
05:25 - and the javascript file inside the html
05:28 - follow me link you hit tab okay and then
05:31 - you write style dot sas like this so we
05:34 - are linking this sas file inside our
05:37 - html and in order to link the main.js
05:41 - come below the body over here
05:43 - at the middle over here okay so you
05:45 - write script ah there is the option
05:49 - and over here you write main.js like
05:52 - this
05:53 - ctrl s and we are done
05:55 - change the document to media query
05:57 - practice
06:02 - and inside over here you write dot
06:04 - container
06:06 - p a i n e r tab container tab and then
06:09 - inside over here we're gonna create a
06:11 - div with the class name text like this
06:13 - dot text tab
06:16 - and over here you write hello
06:18 - screen
06:22 - ctrl s and then
06:25 - below the container not inside the
06:26 - container below the container you're
06:28 - gonna create a d with the id size like
06:31 - this follow me hashtag size
06:34 - tab so this is an id and don't forget
06:37 - that this is not inside over here not
06:40 - inside the container it is outside the
06:42 - container over here okay
06:44 - so this will carry the width of our
06:46 - window let me show you again if you come
06:48 - back to this pane over here
06:51 - you can see that this is actually
06:53 - showing us live okay
06:55 - and
06:57 - this is our id inside our html which is
06:59 - uh this one we're gonna style this and
07:02 - then give it some function inside the
07:04 - javascript
07:05 - so control s we are done with our html
07:08 - and now come to the sas part oh you also
07:11 - need to download some extensions so if
07:13 - you can't see this activity bar over
07:16 - here what you're gonna do you click this
07:18 - view and you click appearance and you're
07:20 - gonna get this activity bar okay
07:23 - and if you can't see actually
07:25 - if you can't see the blue ribbon over
07:27 - here you come to view and then
07:30 - appearance and then you hit that
07:33 - status bar okay so this is called status
07:36 - bar and this is called activity bar
07:39 - so you come over to extensions
07:41 - and you hit
07:43 - you write live
07:45 - says
07:47 - not live says sorry sass compiler okay
07:51 - and you're gonna get this
07:53 - over here
07:54 - uh not this sorry live says compiler
07:58 - you're gonna install live sas compiler
08:00 - okay and the next thing that you're
08:02 - gonna install is
08:05 - live server
08:12 - or this one you're going to install this
08:14 - one once you have installed the
08:16 - extensions come back to our sas file and
08:18 - we also need to remove the default
08:20 - styles of our browser in order to do
08:22 - that you hit start curly braces and you
08:25 - set margin padding to zero pixels each
08:27 - to do that m0px tap p0px tap and set the
08:32 - box size into border box to do that both
08:34 - side tap okay bobo
08:38 - our tab which is borderbox emmett does
08:40 - all the shortcuts for us
08:43 - now we're gonna set the font family
08:45 - inside the body as sans serif okay s a
08:48 - and s
08:50 - save like this we're gonna set the font
08:53 - size to 35 pixels like this f size tab
08:57 - 35 pixels
08:59 - all right we're done styling
09:03 - our default styles you hit save and then
09:07 - what you're gonna do you can see this
09:09 - small option over here which is watch
09:11 - sas you're gonna click this okay
09:14 - so once you have clicked on it you're
09:16 - gonna get two files generated over here
09:18 - which is style.css and style.css
09:22 - why is that that's because the browser
09:25 - can't run our sas file directly needs to
09:28 - convert from sas to css and then we can
09:31 - see it on our browser that's why it is
09:34 - generating us this file over here and
09:36 - you can see that this is all css
09:37 - converted css from sas to css so now
09:41 - you're going to come back to our
09:42 - index.html
09:44 - and from here
09:46 - you're going to remove the s and convert
09:48 - it to
09:49 - css from sas
09:51 - control s don't forget to save okay and
09:54 - now you're gonna run this on our browser
09:56 - in order to do that you can either get
09:58 - an option over here which is open live
10:01 - server or if you can't see the option
10:03 - over here like myself you're gonna what
10:05 - you're gonna do is right click over here
10:08 - and you can see this option open with
10:10 - live server click on it
10:15 - and now it is running on live server on
10:17 - our browser congratulations
10:20 - okay so now let's come back to our vs
10:23 - code the next thing that we're going to
10:25 - do is come to main.js and we also need
10:28 - to now come back to the main.js file and
10:31 - over here we're going to write some very
10:33 - little bit of javascript so that we can
10:35 - actually run this on our
10:38 - project which is this one
10:40 - which is
10:41 - which will show us the life value of our
10:44 - width of our screen so you have to do
10:46 - that follow along with me so first of
10:49 - all you write window don't worry i'm
10:51 - going to explain little by little what
10:53 - each line means so window dot on
10:56 - resize equal to screen okay and then
11:00 - write window
11:02 - dot on load
11:05 - equal to screen
11:07 - okay and then we're gonna create a
11:09 - function over here function named screen
11:13 - okay
11:14 - and inside over here you're gonna write
11:16 - my
11:17 - width
11:18 - equal to
11:20 - window dot
11:24 - inner
11:25 - width over here okay okay now let me
11:29 - explain the javascript what i have
11:30 - written
11:31 - so let's start with the window thing
11:33 - over here this entire vs code is a
11:35 - window okay this entire google chrome is
11:38 - a window
11:40 - so now on resize and on reload let me
11:43 - explain to you so if you come back to
11:45 - our browser over here i mean the project
11:48 - one if you resize it like this and now
11:51 - you can see that value changes so it is
11:54 - happening live so the function over here
11:58 - on load is working on resize what is
12:01 - happening if you
12:02 - stretch it like this on resize is
12:05 - working so it is loading live so which
12:08 - is
12:09 - um this one on load and my width equal
12:12 - to windows inner width is working to
12:14 - show us the length from here to here
12:18 - i mean the width so that's how this
12:20 - thing is working and now we also need to
12:22 - display it on our browser
12:24 - so let me come back to our project so we
12:28 - want to display it over here okay in
12:30 - order to do that
12:31 - um we're gonna write we need to target
12:34 - our id over here which is this one okay
12:38 - in order to target that exact thing what
12:40 - you're gonna write is document
12:43 - dot get element by id that's because it
12:46 - is an id if it was a class then we would
12:49 - have written get element by class name
12:52 - don't worry about this i'm gonna create
12:54 - an entire video on this topic in the
12:56 - future so you're gonna write quotes and
12:59 - then size over here because the name was
13:02 - size and then dot inner
13:04 - html like this so the main purpose of
13:08 - inner html is to insert text
13:11 - inside our div with the class name of
13:14 - size over here okay and now we're gonna
13:16 - write equal to and now we're gonna write
13:18 - some text okay with
13:21 - colon
13:23 - okay and then you're gonna hit plus sign
13:27 - let me save it and show you what is
13:29 - happening
13:30 - i remove the plus and just colon okay
13:33 - and now back to the browser we can't see
13:36 - anything because we made a mistake over
13:38 - here that's why we can't see anything
13:40 - you write screen ctrl s and now we can
13:42 - see our text over here all right and now
13:46 - what we're gonna write is we want it
13:49 - um
13:50 - we want the width to be shown over here
13:52 - in order to do that
13:54 - um what you're going to write is
13:56 - you hit plus sign over here and you
13:59 - write the name of
14:00 - this variable okay so you write my width
14:05 - like this ctrl s and now we can see the
14:08 - value over here so this is the pixel
14:10 - value
14:11 - um you come back to vs code and you
14:13 - write another small word plus
14:17 - and then quotes
14:19 - pixels px control s
14:23 - and now it is displaying successfully
14:25 - now let's bring it at the middle at the
14:27 - center over here okay so come back to vs
14:30 - code um let me remove this because we
14:32 - don't need the activity bar and we also
14:35 - don't need this bar from here the status
14:37 - bar all right and we're also done with
14:40 - the main.js file we don't need it so you
14:42 - can
14:43 - minimize it
14:44 - okay and if you want to minimize this as
14:46 - well you hit ctrl b if you hit ctrl b
14:50 - again then this panel will come back
14:53 - okay so ctrl b
14:55 - and now on the sas file you target the
14:59 - container text and the size hashtag size
15:02 - so dot
15:03 - container container curly braces like
15:07 - this
15:09 - you target the text dot text like this
15:12 - and you target the size hashtag size
15:15 - like this all right
15:17 - so now we want the hello text to be at
15:18 - the very center in order to do that
15:20 - first of all we need to define the size
15:22 - i mean the height of our container if
15:25 - you don't you find the height what
15:26 - happens is let me show you
15:28 - let's define some border around our
15:31 - container okay
15:32 - border of let's say 4px solid
15:36 - red okay ctrl s
15:38 - minimize this
15:40 - and now we can see that the container is
15:42 - just this portion of our
15:44 - browser but we want it to be at the
15:46 - maximum otherwise we can't work properly
15:49 - so in order to do that come back to vs
15:51 - code you set the height over here to 100
15:54 - vh which is the whole screen height
15:57 - control s
15:59 - and now we can see that the container
16:02 - has stretched from here
16:04 - to here and now we can work with our
16:06 - project successfully back to vs code you
16:08 - remove the border from here ctrl s
16:11 - and you can see the text has our width
16:14 - has come to the very bottom over here we
16:16 - want it to be at the very center and
16:18 - this one over here as well so come back
16:20 - to vs code you can center the hello text
16:23 - in two ways you can either use the
16:25 - display grid or you can also use the
16:27 - display
16:28 - flex let me show both of them okay first
16:31 - write d flex okay tap if you write
16:35 - justify content to center then it is
16:37 - going to work on the x-axis okay let me
16:41 - show you
16:42 - so you can see that the hello screen has
16:43 - moved to the center of the x-axis this
16:46 - is the x-axis and this is the y-axis all
16:49 - right so now back to vs code if you want
16:52 - to keep it at the center along the
16:54 - y-axis what you have to write is align
16:57 - con
16:58 - align items center
17:01 - ctrl s minimize this and let's see you
17:03 - can see that this is at the very center
17:06 - and if you want to use the grid what you
17:09 - have to write is d
17:11 - grid
17:12 - tab display grid and place items in the
17:15 - shorthand of both the x and y axis so
17:18 - place
17:19 - content
17:20 - center like this
17:22 - and you
17:24 - comment this from here ctrl s minimize
17:28 - it and you can see that it's still
17:29 - working and now we need to place this
17:31 - text at the very center
17:33 - over here at the bottom of hello screen
17:37 - back to the
17:38 - back to vs code um you come at the
17:41 - bottom over here you write first of all
17:43 - position absolute post apps tap position
17:47 - absolute and then top
17:49 - 50 or not 50 um 60
17:52 - like this left 50 percent
18:00 - like this and let's see what is giving
18:02 - us the result
18:04 - um you can see that it is over here but
18:06 - we want it to be at the very center but
18:08 - it is not working why is that let me
18:10 - explain to you on the x-axis i have
18:12 - defined 50 percent so from here to here
18:15 - it is 50
18:17 - but actually this is the center okay it
18:20 - should have worked from here to here but
18:23 - it is working from here to here so in
18:25 - order to fix that you have to write the
18:27 - transform property
18:29 - transform and then translate x which is
18:33 - the x-axis you can also work with the
18:35 - y-axis but not for this tutorial i'm
18:37 - gonna make an entire video on the
18:39 - transform property so make sure to
18:41 - subscribe so that you can get an update
18:43 - about this okay so translate x minus 50
18:47 - okay ctrl s and now we can see that our
18:50 - problem has been solved over here
18:53 - back to over here you also set the font
18:55 - size to 35 pixels font size 35 pixels
18:59 - like this ctrl s and we are done come
19:02 - back to the container over here and you
19:04 - give it a color of bgc tap um set it to
19:08 - white for now uh if i come back to my
19:11 - blog over here i have defined a lot of
19:13 - colors um wait so these are the colors
19:16 - over here i'm gonna copy it from here
19:17 - don't write right now i'm gonna give you
19:19 - a moment so control uh copy from here
19:23 - come back to our vs code on the sas at
19:26 - the very top okay
19:28 - over here i'm going to paste it over
19:29 - here now pause the video take a moment
19:31 - to write these lines of code over here
19:33 - and don't forget to write the dollar
19:35 - sign otherwise it is not going to work
19:37 - so these are called variables
19:39 - so i'm storing our color hex values over
19:42 - here and then we're gonna use it all
19:44 - along inside our project every time if
19:46 - you need to change something you don't
19:49 - have to go through and read the entire
19:51 - document what you have to do is you just
19:53 - change over here and then the entire
19:55 - document will be changed that's why sas
19:58 - is more powerful than regular css and it
20:01 - saves us a lot of time we're gonna also
20:03 - define our breakpoints inside variables
20:06 - and then we're gonna use it to define
20:08 - our media queries i'm gonna show that to
20:10 - you don't worry about this and yeah i
20:12 - got these colors from this website over
20:14 - here which is coolers dot co let me show
20:16 - you if you visit the website you can
20:18 - find tons of colors over here you can
20:20 - choose any color you want
20:22 - for your projects link of this website
20:24 - will be given in the description down
20:26 - below so that you can go and check it
20:28 - out okay now back to vs code on the
20:30 - container you remove this let me show
20:32 - you a sample of how these variables work
20:34 - so it was hashtag
20:36 - fff which defined the white color and if
20:39 - you want to bring this color one over
20:42 - here i don't know what is the name but
20:43 - let's say this is purple because i'm
20:45 - seeing purple over here so if you want
20:47 - to bring that purple color over here
20:49 - what you have to write is
20:51 - dollar
20:52 - sign color
20:54 - 1 ctrl s and now you can see that the
20:57 - color 1 which is the purple color has
21:00 - been applied over here oh come back to
21:02 - the vs code and on the hashtag size you
21:06 - change the color to red so that we can
21:09 - better see what we are trying to do
21:11 - ctrl s and now we can see that we have
21:14 - achieved our desired result okay now
21:17 - we're done with our setup let's start
21:18 - the tutorial
21:20 - let's say that i'm your friend and you
21:21 - don't even recognize me in this case
21:23 - what i have to do is i have to tell my
21:25 - name to you my name is joy in the same
21:28 - way we have to tell the browser that we
21:31 - are defining a media query that's why we
21:34 - write the term at the red media to tell
21:36 - the browser that recognize this this is
21:39 - a media query and then we write
21:41 - conditions over here like screen
21:44 - and then
21:46 - max
21:47 - width
21:48 - let's set it to let's say
21:50 - 768 pixels and we also write the min
21:54 - width over here let's say it was let's
21:56 - say 768 pixels like this so this
22:00 - media query at the right media query is
22:02 - a declaration telling the browser that
22:05 - we are starting a media query from here
22:08 - and these are our conditions the screen
22:10 - which is the media type and max width
22:13 - mean with these are our conditions don't
22:15 - worry about this i'm going to explain in
22:17 - details about each and every
22:19 - condition over here okay and then inside
22:22 - this curly braces
22:23 - we're gonna define our styles over here
22:26 - okay your styles are here
22:30 - so once the browser recognizes our media
22:32 - query
22:33 - and then if our styles i mean if our
22:36 - conditions are met then all the styles
22:39 - that we have defined here will be
22:41 - applied on our browser
22:43 - as simple as that and you might have
22:46 - seen these operators the coma and the
22:48 - and operator
22:50 - let me explain this to you right now
22:52 - let's say you have gone to a restaurant
22:54 - and you have ordered two things burger
22:56 - and a pizza so write this
22:59 - burger
23:01 - and
23:02 - pizza okay
23:04 - let's say that your friend has ordered
23:06 - burger pizza and coca-cola like this
23:11 - burger
23:13 - you write coma okay pizza
23:16 - and
23:17 - cooka
23:18 - sorry
23:20 - hookah hold on like this
23:23 - so let's see what is happening
23:25 - burger and pizza two different commands
23:28 - okay it is separated by what a and
23:32 - and these three things you see these are
23:34 - separated by a comma and the end
23:38 - in the same way these are our commands
23:40 - okay
23:41 - so if you have if you have uh let's say
23:44 - that just two commands so what we're
23:46 - gonna write is the and operator over
23:49 - here okay but if you have three or more
23:53 - then you're gonna use the comma and the
23:55 - end operator like this so let's say you
23:57 - have three commands so control v which
24:00 - is the
24:01 - main weight you're gonna write and over
24:03 - here and
24:05 - you're not gonna write n you're gonna
24:06 - write comma over here and then it's
24:08 - gonna work so let's remove them i hope
24:11 - you understood the operators coma and
24:14 - the and operator now let's discuss about
24:17 - the media type in total you have four
24:19 - options all print screen and speech
24:22 - don't worry about all of these values
24:24 - because you're gonna use the screen
24:26 - option
24:27 - to make responsive website for
24:29 - electronic devices
24:31 - even if you don't declare the media type
24:34 - it's gonna set it to all this one
24:36 - automatically so skim through this chart
24:39 - over here i hope you understood the
24:41 - media type over here you can write
24:42 - either screen
24:44 - or or you can keep it blank and it's
24:47 - gonna automatically define it to all now
24:49 - let's discuss about the max width
24:51 - function what this does is it creates us
24:53 - a border okay so when we are inside that
24:57 - border it's gonna work but if we go
24:59 - outside that border it's not gonna work
25:01 - so see this illustration over here you
25:04 - can see that the styles are applied
25:06 - inside this 500 pixels but if we go
25:08 - outside the border of 500 pixels it is
25:11 - not gonna apply the styles it's gonna be
25:13 - blank white let me show you a demo about
25:15 - this so over here you write brackets
25:18 - max width
25:20 - let's say to um 500 pixels over here
25:24 - okay ctrl s
25:26 - you come back to our results screen over
25:28 - here you can see that this is a purple
25:29 - color and let's say that um
25:32 - we're gonna set it to bgc
25:35 - tab
25:36 - okay let's set it to uh the hashtag
25:39 - sorry not hashtag dollar sign color one
25:42 - like this okay ctrl s and you come back
25:44 - to our container over here so you remove
25:47 - this from here
25:49 - and you write uh hashtag
25:51 - fff which defines the white color okay
25:55 - now minimize this and you hit f12
25:59 - f12
26:00 - and now if we resize the window
26:03 - oh that's because you also need to write
26:04 - the name of the selector in order to do
26:07 - that uh what you're going to do is you
26:09 - remove this over here and you're gonna
26:10 - write the selector the container
26:12 - selector okay dot co and e i n e r over
26:17 - here curly braces
26:19 - and then you divide if and then you
26:21 - define it over here like this ctrl s and
26:23 - now it's gonna work okay now minimize
26:26 - this so this you can see that we have
26:28 - set our boundary to 500 pixels as long
26:31 - as we're inside the 500 pixels the color
26:33 - will be applied but if we go outside
26:36 - then it's not gonna
26:37 - get applied so you can see that we are
26:39 - at 787 pixels and the color is not
26:42 - getting applied if you resize the window
26:44 - like this
26:46 - you can see the color is getting applied
26:47 - which means that we're inside the border
26:49 - it is 447 pixels but if we go outside
26:53 - the border
26:54 - um wait let me resize this
26:56 - this is
26:58 - 499 pixels and it is the color purple if
27:02 - you resize it
27:04 - it is 579 pixels and it is white the
27:06 - color is not getting applied i hope you
27:09 - understood the max width function let's
27:11 - talk about the main width function so
27:13 - this is the same thing
27:15 - inside the border it is not going to
27:17 - work if you go outside the border then
27:19 - it's gonna work
27:20 - let me show you a demo and then you're
27:23 - gonna get
27:24 - clear about this okay now come back to
27:27 - vs code and from here you write min with
27:29 - okay let me give a practical demo
27:33 - let's say that i am over here i live in
27:35 - bangladesh and we don't have starbucks
27:38 - so outside my border let's say this is
27:40 - america okay so america has starbucks so
27:44 - inside the border here i am if i go
27:46 - outside the border
27:48 - which is if i go to america then i'm
27:50 - gonna get starbucks but if i stay inside
27:53 - the border
27:54 - then i'm not gonna get in starbucks in
27:57 - the same way inside the mean width our
27:59 - styles will not get applied but if we
28:02 - get outside the border our styles will
28:04 - get applied
28:06 - okay
28:07 - so now on the vs code we just change the
28:10 - mean width from max width you come back
28:12 - to the result screen over here
28:14 - did we save it no we didn't save it this
28:17 - is very crucial you need to save your
28:18 - code otherwise it's not going to work
28:21 - control s
28:22 - come back to the browser and now
28:25 - we are actually outside the border which
28:28 - was our border 500 pixels okay so now
28:31 - you resize the window like this um
28:34 - so we are inside the border and our
28:36 - styles are not getting applied but if
28:39 - you resize the window let's say uh 480
28:42 - 489 pixels this is
28:45 - inside the border okay outside the board
28:48 - inside the border outside the border i
28:50 - hope you understood the mean with
28:52 - function and now we're gonna write the
28:54 - code itself to be honest there is no
28:56 - such thing as a standard media query
28:59 - breakpoints because of various screen
29:02 - sizes on the market for this tutorial
29:04 - i'm gonna use the official bootstrap
29:06 - five breakpoint chart if you click this
29:09 - link over here
29:11 - then you can see the various standard um
29:14 - screen break points
29:16 - defined by bootstrap five
29:18 - so if you scroll down you can see all
29:20 - the values over here
29:22 - and we're gonna define all of these
29:24 - breakpoints inside variables so that we
29:26 - can easily manage our code so if you
29:29 - scroll down you're gonna find all of
29:31 - these values over here so i'm gonna copy
29:33 - them ctrl c and at the very top okay i'm
29:37 - gonna paste it over here
29:39 - review
29:41 - now pause the video
29:43 - and write these values over here
29:45 - and also don't forget to write the
29:47 - dollar sign at first otherwise it's not
29:49 - going to work
29:51 - so this is the breakpoint for the mobile
29:53 - version
29:54 - this is the break from the this is the
29:56 - breakpoint for the tablet laptop and the
29:58 - desktop version 576 pixels and so on now
30:02 - how we're gonna use this is if you come
30:05 - back to the media query at the very
30:07 - bottom you can see that this is 500
30:09 - pixels okay so this is writing directly
30:12 - instead of writing directly over here we
30:15 - write the variable okay dollar sign
30:18 - mobile
30:19 - b-i-l-e like this and automatically the
30:22 - 576 pixels which is this one this value
30:26 - is 576 pixels is applied over here okay
30:31 - now the cool feature of writing like
30:33 - this is that if you need to change
30:35 - something let's say you need to change
30:36 - the media query you have to go through
30:38 - all these lines of code you have to read
30:40 - all of them
30:41 - which is a very big headache so if you
30:44 - write like this using variables throw
30:47 - says if we need to change something you
30:49 - don't have to go through all of the
30:51 - files all of the lines of code you just
30:53 - need to change it over here
30:55 - how simple is that that's why you should
30:56 - use sas
30:58 - even if you're a beginner all right then
31:00 - let's complete our project one and let's
31:02 - move to project two okay
31:04 - so in order to complete this
31:07 - uh
31:08 - not mean with we're gonna write max with
31:10 - okay and then we're gonna set the color
31:12 - which is uh i have to originate on the
31:14 - comment so color one is for the mobile
31:17 - version color two for the tablet and so
31:19 - on so in order to do that uh this is
31:22 - actually perfect and then we're gonna
31:24 - write at the red
31:26 - media
31:27 - for the tablet
31:29 - max width
31:32 - dollar sign tablet
31:34 - like this and over here you're gonna
31:36 - write container
31:38 - and curly braces bgc tab and define
31:42 - dollar sign color to over here okay a
31:46 - very quick tip
31:48 - if you want to define media queries
31:50 - first you're gonna write the biggest
31:52 - screen at the first and then smallest
31:55 - screen at the bottom it's a descending
31:58 - order
31:58 - so the largest will be at the first and
32:01 - descending decending and the smallest
32:03 - will be at the bottom if you don't do
32:05 - this then it's not gonna work let me
32:07 - show you a demo
32:08 - okay so you come back to the browser um
32:10 - over here so the color one which was
32:14 - purple color it is not working look look
32:17 - the color is not even changing
32:19 - but if you write it in the reverse order
32:22 - let me show you so this is the mobile
32:24 - smallest one first largest one later but
32:28 - if you write in the reverse order ctrl x
32:31 - and you paste it over here ctrl v ctrl s
32:35 - and then minimize it and now it's
32:37 - working look
32:39 - resized it this is purple color look um
32:42 - look it's 567 pixels if you resize it
32:46 - then it's gonna change the color over
32:47 - here
32:48 - and on the 768
32:51 - i guess yes 768 mark then it's gonna
32:54 - change the color back to white which is
32:57 - the default color we defined it over
33:00 - here on the container which is this one
33:02 - and let's define our desktop and laptop
33:05 - as well first smaller screen first okay
33:10 - not screen
33:12 - max
33:13 - with
33:14 - sorry
33:15 - with
33:17 - dollar sign laptop like this and over
33:20 - here we're gonna write dot com day near
33:24 - curly braces then bgc
33:27 - bgc tab
33:29 - dollar sign
33:31 - color
33:32 - free ctrl s
33:34 - okay the
33:36 - then
33:37 - copy this
33:38 - paste it over here you just change the
33:41 - value from here to desktop okay
33:44 - and then the color will be color number
33:46 - four ctrl s and we're done with our
33:48 - project one let's go and test it so you
33:51 - resize the window
33:53 - you can see the color is changing
33:55 - perfectly okay so this is desktop
33:57 - version this is the laptop version
34:00 - tablet
34:01 - mobile i hope you understood project one
34:04 - let's move on to project two so we're
34:06 - gonna be building this for project two
34:08 - let's start
34:10 - minimize this
34:12 - come back to our vs code control b okay
34:17 - now what we're gonna do we're gonna
34:18 - remove some code from here okay so
34:20 - remove these variables we don't need
34:22 - them anymore
34:24 - okay so over here we can keep it
34:28 - you need to change the font size from
34:30 - here okay
34:32 - and don't delete this uh it's not
34:34 - working that's because
34:36 - uh we also need to change this media
34:39 - queries from here that's because we
34:41 - don't need them so in total we have four
34:43 - media queries
34:44 - from the project one delete them and
34:47 - don't remove the size from here
34:48 - otherwise we can't see our width of our
34:51 - screen live
34:53 - okay minimize this just don't remove it
34:56 - and remove all of the code from here
35:00 - and then ctrl s back to index dot html
35:03 - don't remove the size from here okay you
35:06 - just remove this text from here
35:10 - ctrl s all right so we are pretty much
35:12 - done back to the
35:14 - design now on the project you can see
35:16 - that we have the logo over here and the
35:18 - menu items over here let's consider this
35:21 - header
35:22 - okay and the content over here the
35:25 - image and this text over here is the
35:27 - main and this this one
35:30 - which contains the social media links
35:32 - will be our footer header
35:34 - main and the footer okay so in order to
35:37 - create them come back to vs code and
35:39 - inside the container we're gonna create
35:42 - three classes with the class names of i
35:44 - mean we're gonna create three divs with
35:46 - the class names header main footer
35:48 - so dot
35:49 - header
35:51 - tab
35:52 - dot main tab okay
35:55 - oh sorry
35:57 - and dot footer control sorry tab
36:02 - so we have header
36:04 - main and footer okay so inside over here
36:07 - we're gonna write the logo and menu
36:09 - items for this project i'm gonna use the
36:12 - bam naming system even if you don't
36:13 - understand that don't worry just follow
36:15 - along in in the future video i will show
36:18 - you how you can use the bam naming
36:19 - system
36:20 - now write dot header
36:23 - dash dash
36:24 - logo tab
36:26 - and now over here we're gonna write the
36:28 - logo which is uh mia ruma okay you write
36:32 - mia
36:34 - rumor over here
36:36 - and now we're gonna write the menu items
36:38 - in order to do that dot header
36:41 - that's there's menu okay tap
36:46 - hit enter and over here you write dot
36:49 - header dash dash menu
36:52 - hyphen star three okay now it's gonna
36:55 - create us three divs so over here you
36:58 - write
36:58 - one
37:00 - then two three okay you write over here
37:04 - home
37:05 - on a serial okay
37:07 - portfolio
37:11 - and over here we're gonna write contacts
37:15 - all right so we are actually done with
37:17 - our header section we can minimize it
37:19 - ctrl s let's go and see what we have
37:22 - created so far uh we don't need this and
37:25 - we have created all of this right now
37:28 - don't worry about them we're gonna style
37:30 - them now we're gonna write the main
37:32 - section okay so over here
37:34 - now inside the main section we're going
37:37 - to create two divs
37:38 - image and text so image will be over
37:41 - here on the left side and the text will
37:43 - be on the here right side so in order to
37:45 - do that write dot
37:48 - main
37:49 - dash dash
37:50 - star 2 tap so we're gonna put the image
37:54 - over here and the text will be over here
37:57 - txt okay so we're gonna clip it so we're
38:00 - gonna keep this blank because we're
38:01 - gonna use the background property
38:03 - background image property to insert the
38:06 - image over here
38:08 - all right and inside the main text what
38:11 - we're gonna write is main
38:13 - dash dash text
38:16 - hyphen star um
38:18 - how many how many texts do we have let's
38:21 - see
38:22 - one
38:23 - two
38:24 - three and four
38:26 - so in order to write this four we're
38:28 - gonna create four divs inside over here
38:31 - four tap okay
38:33 - one two three four so first one was
38:37 - hello and the hand wave we're gonna um
38:40 - go to google
38:42 - and
38:43 - write hand wave hand
38:45 - with emoji
38:48 - like this
38:51 - you copy this
38:52 - icon from here
38:54 - ctrl c
38:57 - paste it over here ctrl v
39:02 - and over here we're gonna write um
39:05 - mia
39:06 - ruma
39:07 - and
39:09 - we're gonna write span tag over here in
39:12 - order to convert the text to red color
39:15 - okay so s p a n
39:18 - span and it's gonna create that
39:20 - automatically we have to just cut it
39:23 - from here and paste it over here ctrl f
39:27 - and i'm a designer
39:29 - was the text i guess let me check
39:33 - uh it is a a designer from
39:36 - tokyo japan
39:37 - a
39:38 - b e s i g n e r
39:41 - f r o m and over here we're gonna write
39:44 - tokyo japan
39:51 - let's see what we have created so far so
39:53 - these are the unstyled text over here
39:56 - we're gonna style them don't worry and
39:58 - now we also have to write something
40:00 - inside the footer and first write dot f
40:04 - double o t e r we have four social media
40:06 - icons
40:08 - dash dash dribble d-r-i-b-b-l-e

40:19 - twitter okay so insta is first
40:25 - instagram
40:29 - tap okay and then over here we're gonna
40:32 - use the image
40:33 - tag to insert the image
40:36 - and dot footer
40:39 - in order to create
40:40 - the remaining
40:42 - divs automatically you hit star three
40:45 - tab okay instagram
40:48 - twitter what was next i
40:50 - forgot um

41:00 - d r i b b b l e three b's okay
41:05 - and behind say
41:08 - the hands okay so inside this tags we're
41:11 - gonna create the image tag okay img tab
41:14 - so keep it blank for now we're not gonna
41:16 - insert anything
41:18 - img tap okay
41:22 - img tap
41:25 - and img tap ctrl s let's see what we
41:28 - have created so far it looks quite ugly
41:31 - but don't worry we're gonna style them
41:34 - okay so we're actually done with the
41:35 - html come to
41:37 - style.css and we're gonna target the
41:40 - classes over here okay so right dot
41:43 - container
41:45 - over here and the header dot header
41:50 - dot main
41:53 - and then dot footer
41:55 - over here okay so let's first style our
41:57 - header okay
41:59 - ctrl s but before everything else you
42:02 - need to set the height otherwise it's
42:04 - not going to work i have shown this to
42:06 - you on the first project okay so 800 vh
42:10 - con uh hundred vh tab so ctrl s
42:14 - and now let's go back first things first
42:17 - we're gonna use the display flex
42:19 - property okay
42:20 - now back to our project on the header
42:23 - section uh let me actually show this to
42:25 - you live
42:26 - by live i mean that let me write over
42:28 - here let me show you over here okay so
42:31 - you hit ctrl b there's an extension
42:33 - named text pins d e s k
42:37 - p i n s so if you
42:39 - click over here you can see the window
42:41 - is vanishing over here so i'm clicking
42:43 - here i'm clicking here the window is
42:45 - vanished so what text pin does is let me
42:48 - show that to you um here is a text pin
42:51 - let me enable it
42:53 - okay so i'm enabling this pin inside
42:55 - this vs code and now let's click outside
42:59 - you can see that
43:00 - the window is not vanishing it is
43:01 - staying and on its place permanently
43:04 - okay so now i'm gonna keep it over here
43:07 - and i'm gonna show this to you live over
43:08 - here what is happening behind the scenes
43:12 - okay so now inside the header we're
43:14 - gonna write d
43:16 - flex okay
43:17 - ctrl s and now you can see that
43:20 - this
43:21 - menu items were here and now it has
43:24 - shifted over here the default value of
43:26 - flex direction is row so write it
43:28 - anyways even though there will be no
43:31 - uh changes
43:34 - flex direction row
43:36 - ctrl s and now we can see no changes
43:38 - because that's the default value anyways
43:41 - and now what we're going to do is we
43:42 - want
43:43 - the menu and the
43:45 - logo to be stretched from the very left
43:48 - to the very right so in order to do that
43:50 - inside the header you're going to write
43:52 - justify content let me bring the vs code
43:55 - over here so that you can actually see
43:58 - what i'm doing justify content it will
44:01 - be a space between
44:04 - ctrl s and now you can see that
44:07 - the logo is over here and our menu items
44:10 - are over here okay
44:13 - and now we also want
44:15 - our menu items to behave like a row
44:18 - instead of behaving like a column in
44:20 - order to do that if you can recall the
44:22 - head
44:23 - if you can recall the menu items are
44:25 - inside the header
44:27 - which was that
44:28 - so come over here uh let me maximize it
44:31 - to show you how to write the selector
44:34 - for the logo and the menu items to do
44:37 - that
44:38 - and
44:38 - dash dash
44:40 - logo okay curly braces so this one is
44:43 - actually equivalent to writing dot
44:46 - header
44:49 - dash dash logo
44:51 - i mean look so this end is actually
44:54 - getting extended from here to here so
44:57 - this is actually a shorthand i mean
44:59 - shortcut that's why sas is much better
45:01 - than regular css
45:03 - let's remove this
45:04 - in the same way we're going to target
45:06 - the
45:07 - menu and dash dash menu like this ctrl s
45:12 - and now
45:13 - we're going to style this okay in order
45:15 - to do that i mean in order to target
45:17 - that what you have to do is you have to
45:20 - come to end dash dash menu you write d
45:24 - flex
45:25 - tab
45:26 - and flex direction say to row which is
45:28 - the default value anyways ctrl s
45:32 - and now we can see that this is style
45:33 - like this
45:34 - and let's change the font size as well
45:37 - for the logo and the menu items in order
45:39 - to do that you come to the logo and you
45:41 - write f size tab
45:44 - okay
45:45 - for vw we're gonna use the vw units okay
45:49 - we reload control f
45:51 - and for the menu we're gonna write 2.5
45:54 - vw
45:55 - f size tab
45:58 - 2.5
46:01 - 2.5 vw control s
46:04 - and we're gonna use some gaps between
46:06 - our menu items in order to do that come
46:09 - over here you write gap
46:12 - 15 pixels you can change the value as
46:14 - you like perfect it looks quite good now
46:17 - what you're gonna do is you're gonna
46:18 - divide the screen
46:20 - between the rows what i mean by that is
46:23 - you come back to vs code and over here
46:25 - on the header section you write h
46:28 - 10 percent okay ctrl s and then you're
46:31 - gonna create border so in order to
46:34 - create the border we're creating a
46:36 - border over here that's because we want
46:38 - to see exactly what we are doing and
46:40 - where the code is getting applied so
46:42 - right
46:43 - border
46:44 - 2px solid red control s
46:49 - resize this and now we can see that this
46:51 - is our header section it is taking 10
46:53 - percent of the entire screen and we can
46:56 - see that how things are working over
46:58 - here you can see that
47:00 - this
47:00 - menu items are not at the exact center
47:04 - over here so in order to do that you
47:06 - come to back to vs code and
47:09 - and header menu not here sorry on the
47:12 - header section you have to write align
47:15 - items center so you write
47:18 - um sorry
47:20 - align
47:22 - items oh sorry
47:25 - center over here like this ctrl s and
47:28 - now you can see that and now you can see
47:29 - that the items has moved from the top to
47:32 - the center if i uh uncomment this then
47:34 - you can see the difference okay let me
47:36 - uncomment this ctrl s and now see the
47:38 - difference okay let me uncomment this
47:40 - again ctrl s and now we can see that it
47:43 - has moved to the center again
47:45 - we're gonna do the same thing for the
47:47 - main and the footer as well so
47:49 - height we're gonna define it a percent
47:52 - 80 percentage like this ctrl s and for
47:56 - the footer section height of 10 percent
47:59 - okay
48:01 - control s so 10
48:03 - 80 percent 10 percent in total 100
48:06 - and let's define the borders as well so
48:09 - that we can see what we are doing
48:12 - border
48:13 - 2px
48:16 - solid
48:18 - black
48:19 - like this and for this section
48:22 - border
48:24 - 2px solid green like this ctrl s and
48:29 - let's see what we have done so far so
48:31 - this is
48:32 - the main and this is the footer section
48:36 - over here we're gonna have our
48:38 - social media icons
48:41 - okay now let's tell them first let's
48:44 - insert the image so in order to do that
48:46 - come back to vs code and let me just
48:50 - resize this so that you can also see the
48:52 - code and the result
48:56 - so
48:56 - what you're gonna do is you're gonna
48:58 - click the small icon over here and
48:59 - minimize everything okay and now
49:02 - everything will be on its position
49:04 - okay so inside the main first of all
49:07 - we're gonna target the
49:09 - image and then target the text in order
49:11 - to target them you write and dash dash
49:14 - image curly braces and then and dash
49:18 - dash text so this one is targeting text
49:21 - and this is targeting the image okay
49:23 - curly braces ctrl s and inside over here
49:26 - you're going to write bgi
49:28 - you hit tab okay so inside over here um
49:32 - let me maximize this and you hit ctrl b
49:36 - and inside the images folder so we're
49:39 - gonna use this image this is the
49:41 - portrait of this young woman this one
49:44 - over here is love the lady
49:46 - so um you come over here in order to
49:49 - target that exact image you write dot
49:52 - slash
49:53 - select this folder images folder and
49:56 - then in order to target that lovely lady
50:00 - you're gonna write
50:01 - portrait.png or select this from here
50:04 - and now it has
50:05 - all right let's see and now we can see
50:08 - nothing that's because we need to set
50:10 - either the width or the height depending
50:12 - on the
50:13 - orientation
50:15 - so in order to do that um
50:17 - come back to vs code first of all you
50:19 - need to know the orientation how we want
50:21 - it we want the image to be here and the
50:24 - text to be here okay so display flex
50:26 - will be the flex direction will be row
50:29 - row okay
50:30 - so in order to do that um come to the
50:32 - main and over here you write d
50:35 - flex
50:36 - okay tap
50:37 - and flex direction would be
50:40 - row like this ctrl s
50:42 - and now we're gonna divide i mean
50:45 - distribute the width
50:47 - 50 percent for the image 54 50 percent
50:50 - for the text in order to do that this is
50:52 - the image okay you're gonna write with
50:55 - fifty percent over here okay let's
50:57 - maximize this w fifty percent
51:00 - tap and then width will be
51:02 - fifty percent over here okay tap ctrl s
51:06 - resize this and now we can see the image
51:09 - over here it looks ugly but if you want
51:11 - to work around here what we can do is um
51:15 - [Music]
51:16 - we have to set
51:19 - the
51:20 - background size to contain
51:23 - bg
51:24 - s tab to contain ctrl s
51:27 - and now it looks better but it is
51:29 - getting repeated in order to stop the
51:31 - repetition you're gonna write bgr tab
51:34 - which is background repeat set it to no
51:36 - repeat bgr tab now repeat ctrl s and now
51:40 - we can see that the image is not getting
51:42 - repeated and over here you can see this
51:45 - there is no gap okay it looks quite ugly
51:48 - if you want to
51:49 - give some margin over here resize this
51:52 - come over here you set it to this is the
51:56 - zero pixels for the top bottom if you
51:59 - write five pixels over here then five
52:01 - pixels of padding i mean margin is
52:04 - getting applied here here so first top
52:07 - bottom zero pixels
52:09 - left right five pixels okay control s
52:12 - minimize this let's see what happens on
52:15 - our browser and you can see that five
52:17 - pixels is getting applied over here
52:20 - all right it looks quite good
52:22 - let's actually remove the border from
52:24 - the header because we're done with our
52:26 - header um in order to do that onto the
52:30 - header and just remove them goodbye ctrl
52:33 - s
52:34 - let's go back and it looks good by the
52:37 - way whatever you have written so far is
52:39 - 100 responsive till 4k display do you
52:42 - want to see a demo let me show you
52:45 - f12
52:46 - hit f12 and you go to
52:49 - till 4k you can see that even in 4k it
52:52 - looks good why is that that's because we
52:54 - have used the vw unit which is view port
52:59 - width viewport width that's why you can
53:01 - see that even on the 4k display it looks
53:04 - quite good and look and look i have
53:06 - refined no units for this
53:08 - text over here
53:10 - not even over here do you even remember
53:13 - the font size of our width it was just
53:15 - 35 pixels and this is the default value
53:18 - and this is 4vh this is 2.5 vh
53:23 - now the background size with the value
53:26 - contain which is uh let me show you this
53:28 - line over here i'm sorry let me actually
53:31 - find out this this line over here the
53:32 - background size contain itself is highly
53:35 - responsive
53:37 - so even if you resize the window you can
53:38 - see the image is getting adjusted
53:41 - according to the screen size you can see
53:43 - that it is shrinking
53:45 - at the same time if you stretch the
53:47 - window it's gonna enlarge it itself so
53:49 - that it can fit the window well you can
53:52 - see that it is working like that and our
53:54 - fonts are also responsive it is working
53:57 - according to that if you resize the
53:58 - window the fonts will get smaller and if
54:02 - you resize it again then it's gonna get
54:03 - bigger which is highly responsive even
54:05 - on the 4k display can you imagine that
54:08 - okay now um come back to vs code and
54:12 - let's work with our uh we're actually
54:15 - done with this section the image and
54:17 - we're gonna work with um
54:20 - the mobile version at the very last and
54:22 - first of all we need to change the text
54:25 - okay now you close the developer tools
54:28 - and you come to
54:31 - um
54:32 - we can we can actually remove the border
54:34 - from here as well ctrl s and on the text
54:37 - which is inside this main
54:39 - you create border so that we can see
54:42 - what we are trying to do okay
54:45 - border we're going to set it to red
54:46 - color okay 2px solid red like this ctrl
54:50 - s and now we have the border over here
54:53 - so that we can actually see
54:55 - where our text are going okay now let's
54:58 - come back to vs code and we want our
55:01 - text to be at the very center in order
55:04 - to do that you can either use the grid
55:07 - or you can use flexbox so we're gonna
55:09 - use the grid because i showed you both
55:12 - beforehand okay you can use anything you
55:14 - want so inside the text you write
55:16 - d
55:17 - grid okay and place
55:21 - oh
55:22 - let's actually use the flex okay
55:25 - because a lot of you don't know
55:27 - how to use the display grid so justify
55:30 - content center
55:32 - okay
55:33 - align items sorry
55:37 - center like this control s
55:40 - and now we can see that uh the thing is
55:43 - actually behaving like a row but we want
55:45 - it to behave like a column in order to
55:47 - do that we're gonna write uh flex
55:50 - direction which was the default value it
55:53 - was row we want to write it column
55:56 - ctrl s
55:58 - and now it looks quite good i mean it
56:00 - looks much better than before and now
56:03 - we're gonna give responsive font sizes
56:05 - to each of this text over here okay
56:09 - so let's come back to vs code and if you
56:12 - can recall on our html um let's go to
56:16 - the main section so the
56:18 - so the text actually looks
56:20 - so so the text have these classes okay
56:23 - in order to
56:24 - target those classes um you come to the
56:28 - and
56:29 - sorry the dot main section and come to
56:32 - the text over here
56:33 - and
56:35 - at the bottom of this you write and
56:38 - hyphen
56:41 - one it is
56:42 - targeting our hello text over here okay
56:46 - let me actually
56:47 - resize this
56:48 - so curly braces you're gonna write it
56:51 - over here and you're gonna set the font
56:53 - size
56:54 - to 10vh sorry vw not vh vw viewport with
56:59 - ctrl f and now we have a very big hello
57:03 - text over here in order to target the
57:05 - remaining three lines over here what you
57:07 - have to write is
57:09 - and hyphen two coma
57:12 - and hyphen 3 comma and hyphen 4
57:16 - curly braces and we're going to set the
57:18 - phone size to 5 vh f size tab
57:22 - 5
57:23 - v sorry not vh vw okay vw control s and
57:28 - now it looks quite good um yeah it looks
57:31 - good
57:32 - and i actually forgot to write something
57:35 - inside the text i mean inside the image
57:38 - over here which is the background
57:40 - position bgp tap let me resize it what
57:44 - we have to write is left and center
57:46 - don't worry i'm going to explain that to
57:48 - you okay you write left
57:51 - center okay
57:52 - ctrl s and let me actually remove all
57:56 - the guides from here and just put guide
58:00 - on our image in order to do that you
58:02 - come to the image okay you write border
58:06 - 2px solid
58:09 - red okay and remove the red color from
58:12 - the text ctrl s and you minimize this
58:15 - and you can see that our image let me
58:17 - actually remove the black color guide as
58:20 - well which is over here
58:21 - uncomment i mean comment this
58:24 - minimize and you can see that we have
58:26 - some gap over here okay that's because
58:28 - we're dealing with portrait images we're
58:30 - not dealing with landscape images okay
58:33 - if you hit f12
58:35 - me actually show you if i resize the
58:37 - window you can see that our image is at
58:39 - the exact center to the left paint to
58:43 - the left center but if you uh remove
58:46 - that line
58:48 - which you're thinking that this is
58:49 - unnecessary line of code uh let me
58:52 - resize this
58:53 - uh drag it over here
58:56 - at the top so that you can see
58:59 - um let me
59:02 - comment this line of code ctrl s and you
59:04 - can see that image is moving from here
59:07 - to the very top over here
59:09 - and if you
59:11 - uh uncomment this ctrl s and you can see
59:14 - that image is getting over here but if
59:17 - you write bottom
59:20 - it has in total four options top
59:23 - right
59:24 - bottom
59:25 - left the first value sorry
59:28 - let me
59:30 - maximize this the first value works on
59:32 - the x-axis and the
59:35 - right value works on the y-axis i have
59:38 - an entire video on background properties
59:40 - link will be given in the description
59:42 - down below go and check it out if you
59:43 - want to make responsive images for your
59:46 - responsive website

59:49 - background position property now let's
59:51 - work with our footer section okay you
59:54 - cross this
59:55 - developer options you remove the guides
59:58 - from here okay in order to remove the
60:00 - red colored guide we can see it is here

60:18 - um in order to remove this you just come
60:21 - come to the index.html we don't need to
60:23 - remove anything except you just comment
60:25 - this line of code okay ctrl s you come
60:28 - back to the browser and everything is
60:30 - gone and if you want to bring it back
60:33 - you just uncomment this line of code
60:34 - over here and it's gonna come back

61:24 - dot slash
61:26 - images p hands
61:29 - control s
61:30 - control b and let's see what happens
61:34 - oh you can see that this is extremely
61:36 - big that's because this is 512 pixels
61:39 - each
61:41 - icon
61:42 - so we need to uh we can see that this is
61:45 - behaving like a column okay
61:47 - like this but we want it to behave like
61:49 - a row so in order to do that come back
61:52 - to vs code um it is actually the footer
61:55 - section okay so you minimize this like
61:57 - this uh minimize and inside the footer
61:59 - section
62:00 - um
62:01 - in order to target all of them you write
62:04 - d grid okay tap the default value is
62:06 - flexed
62:07 - the default value of flex direction is
62:09 - row right anyways
62:12 - direction row control s minimize this
62:16 - and we actually can't see any difference
62:19 - because it is extremely big
62:21 - so let's actually reduce the size okay
62:24 - in order to do that you follow along
62:26 - with me you write square brackets class
62:29 - equal to
62:31 - sorry a power sign equal to double
62:33 - quotes you write footer f double o t e r
62:37 - dash dash what it's gonna what it is
62:39 - gonna do is it's gonna target all our
62:42 - classes which contains our images okay
62:46 - and curly braces over here and you write
62:49 - the image tag img curly braces and
62:52 - you're gonna set width
62:54 - to
62:55 - 5.3
62:57 - vw which is the responsive size
63:00 - ctrl s minimize this uh let's see oh it
63:04 - is actually not working why is that
63:06 - let's go and check it out
63:08 - oh sorry i wrote the wrong thing not
63:10 - great it's gonna be flex
63:12 - sorry sorry
63:13 - uh let's go and check it out uh minimize
63:16 - this
63:17 - ah it's working perfectly fine
63:20 - okay the next thing that we're gonna do
63:22 - is it is actually not at the center okay
63:27 - in order to do
63:28 - i mean in order to place it at the
63:30 - center just like the header one which i
63:33 - explained to you on the header section
63:35 - so what you have to do is um resize this
63:38 - come over oh sorry
63:44 - let's come
63:45 - over
63:46 - here on the footer you write
63:49 - align item center okay align
63:53 - items
63:54 - center like this ctrl s and it's gonna
63:56 - be at the center on the y axis okay and
64:00 - we're gonna place some gap between our
64:02 - icons in order to do that we're gonna
64:04 - write
64:05 - gap of 20 pixels okay like this ctrl s
64:09 - and we can see that we have some gaps
64:11 - between our icons over here and we're
64:13 - gonna place them
64:15 - on the right side in order to do that
64:17 - we're gonna write justified content
64:19 - right or sorry
64:22 - we're gonna write justify content flex
64:24 - end flex and ctrl s
64:29 - and now we can see that it is over here
64:31 - but we want this to be over here not
64:34 - over here in order to do that we're
64:36 - gonna set some margin of 10 pixel margin
64:39 - right
64:40 - right with me m right tap okay margin
64:44 - right set it to 10
64:46 - not pixels sorry it's percentage
64:49 - 10 percentage control s
64:52 - and let me minimize it and you can see
64:53 - that it looks quite good i'm gonna
64:55 - remove the guide from here okay in order
64:57 - to remove the guide you know the drill
64:59 - we just remove this from here
65:02 - let's minimize this and you can see that
65:04 - our website is done it looks quite
65:06 - beautiful if you hit f12 let's resize it
65:10 - even on the 4k display it looks quite
65:12 - good let me show you you come to 4k you
65:15 - can see that uh you
65:17 - focus over here it is written 4k it
65:20 - looks quite good and let's resize this
65:23 - using this guides over here this is
65:25 - laptop large
65:27 - okay it looks good and let's go to
65:30 - laptop
65:31 - of 1024 pixels it looks good as well
65:35 - let's go to the tablet version it looks
65:38 - uh quite uh little shrunk
65:41 - if you resize the window that at at some
65:44 - point it will look quite ugly i oh i
65:46 - actually forgot to remove the bottom
65:48 - from here that's why it looks quite ugly
65:50 - come to the main
65:52 - and image so left bottom change it to
65:56 - center
65:57 - control s
65:59 - okay it looks quite good right now it is
66:02 - loading oh yes it's over here it resize
66:04 - the window
66:05 - at one point you can see that the text
66:08 - looks quite horrible that's because it
66:10 - is very small and it is hard to read
66:12 - that's why we're gonna
66:14 - create a custom media query for the
66:17 - mobile version so in order to do that um
66:20 - we just keep it over here as it is
66:23 - and we also need to change the design
66:26 - for the mobile version okay so if you
66:28 - come to our uh
66:30 - sigma file over here you can see that we
66:32 - don't have any menu items we don't have
66:35 - any menu item options
66:37 - for our mobile version just the
66:40 - logo over here no hello text just the
66:44 - text of our miya rooma a designer from
66:46 - japan and our social media icons pretty
66:50 - simple so in order to implement that um
66:53 - first of all you come to our vs code at
66:57 - the very bottom okay let me maximize
66:59 - this at the very bottom over here we're
67:01 - going to create a media query so and
67:04 - media we're going to set the max width
67:06 - to 650 pixels okay
67:08 - max width
67:10 - of 650 pixels
67:12 - the curly braces over here and now we
67:15 - can target the header along with its
67:17 - logo and text i mean the menu items in
67:20 - order to do that dot header
67:23 - curly braces in order to target the logo
67:27 - and dash dash
67:29 - logo over here earlier basis
67:32 - and in order to drag in the menu items
67:34 - dash dash menu okay so over here you're
67:36 - gonna write display none and it's gonna
67:38 - remove the menu items on the mobile
67:41 - version so d
67:43 - non tap control s if you resize the
67:46 - window so you look it over here okay
67:49 - it's 320 pixels okay if you resize it uh
67:52 - you can see that there is no menu items
67:54 - over here but if it goes above 650
67:58 - pixels then we can see our menu items
68:02 - it is 646 pixels over here you can watch
68:05 - it
68:06 - you can see the
68:07 - menu items has reappeared
68:10 - okay
68:11 - and if you go
68:13 - and we can see everything and now it is
68:15 - gone okay now we want the logo to be at
68:17 - the very center in order to do that come
68:19 - back over here inside the media query
68:22 - inside the dot header selector you write
68:25 - justify content center and it's gonna um
68:30 - center it
68:31 - to at the very
68:32 - center over here now come back to vs
68:35 - code we also need to change the logo
68:37 - font size
68:38 - in order to do that you write f size tab
68:42 - change it to 40 pixels ctrl s let's go
68:45 - back
68:46 - and we can see our logo is 40 pixels and
68:48 - it looks quite good but it's not
68:50 - responsive if we even shrink it that's
68:53 - because it's gonna look very ugly if we
68:55 - use the vw unit in a future video i'm
68:58 - gonna explain to you all the possible
69:00 - css units and what it does so make sure
69:03 - to subscribe to the channel so that you
69:05 - can get an update about the video
69:07 - now let's bring the image over here and
69:10 - it will be
69:11 - circular
69:13 - so in order to do that come back to vs
69:15 - code
69:16 - let's minimize this the header section
69:19 - and over here you're gonna target the
69:21 - dot main section okay curly braces and
69:24 - in order to target the image you write
69:26 - and dash dash
69:28 - image curly braces to target the text
69:30 - you write and dash dash text over here
69:33 - then curly braces control s
69:35 - and we're not gonna see any changes
69:37 - because we didn't even do anything
69:40 - okay resize the window bring this back
69:43 - and um
69:44 - let me keep it over here so that we can
69:47 - see actually what happens
69:50 - first of all uh
69:51 - we need to change the orientation it is
69:54 - currently on the row but we want it to
69:56 - behave like a column so in order to do
69:58 - that um come over here on the main
70:01 - section you write flex direction column
70:04 - flex direction
70:06 - column
70:08 - like this ctrl s and then let's see what
70:10 - happens we cannot see the image okay so
70:13 - in order to bring back the image you
70:14 - come to this section and you write
70:18 - width set it to 200 pixels 200 pixels
70:21 - and set the height to 200 pixels as well
70:24 - ctrl s let's see what happens
70:27 - um here is our image by but we want it
70:30 - to be at the very center in order to do
70:32 - that i'm back to vs code you're gonna
70:35 - write over here okay justify content
70:38 - center okay
70:40 - and then align items center okay i'm not
70:44 - gonna save it let me actually resize it
70:46 - so that you can see what happens if i
70:48 - save it after writing those code so let
70:51 - me uh keep it over here wait a second uh
70:54 - let me control f
70:57 - and you can see the image and the text
70:59 - has appeared on the very center over
71:01 - here
71:02 - now let's resize our social media icons
71:04 - in order to do that come back to vs code
71:07 - um
71:08 - come at the very bottom okay minimize
71:11 - this this is not done okay we're gonna
71:13 - come back here and style it okay
71:15 - so at the bottom right dot footer like
71:18 - this
71:19 - and in order to target all the images
71:21 - you write square bracket plus
71:24 - power sign equal to double quotes
71:28 - footer
71:29 - dash dash okay then curly braces will be
71:32 - over here
71:33 - and now
71:35 - you're gonna write image and then we're
71:37 - gonna set the width
71:39 - to 45 pixels okay
71:41 - and set the height to 45 pixels as well
71:45 - px tab ctrl s
71:48 - now let's go back and see what happens
71:50 - um perfect but it looks quite ugly
71:52 - that's because of
71:54 - of the 10 pixels of
71:56 - i mean the 10 percent margin over here
71:58 - okay in order to remove the margin what
72:00 - you can do is come to the footer section
72:03 - over here and set the justify content to
72:05 - center that's because previously it was
72:08 - on the uh left side okay and set the
72:12 - margin to zero pixels okay now it's
72:14 - gonna work
72:15 - let's go back and it looks uh beautiful
72:19 - now let's resize our text and
72:22 - make the image circular so come back to
72:25 - vs code
72:26 - uh you
72:27 - minimize this
72:29 - this is done the header section is done
72:31 - as well okay come to the main section
72:33 - and over here you're gonna write border
72:36 - radius hundred percent okay
72:39 - percent
72:40 - ctrl s
72:43 - and uh we can see that we have a little
72:46 - bit of
72:47 - distortion over here in order to fix
72:50 - that what you have to do is um you write
72:53 - bg
72:54 - step and set from content to hundred
72:57 - percent like this ctrl s let's see our
73:00 - changes now it's perfectly fine
73:03 - okay we're done with our images come
73:05 - back to our vs code or we also forgot to
73:08 - write the background position it should
73:10 - be on the center bgp tap
73:13 - center as well center like this and it
73:17 - will be
73:18 - perfect
73:19 - um let me see ah yeah it's good
73:22 - let's resize our text over here
73:25 - first of all we're gonna set the width
73:26 - to hundred percent previously it was
73:28 - fifty percent
73:30 - w hundred percent tap okay ctrl s and
73:33 - we're gonna remove the hello text in
73:35 - order to do that and hyphen one curly
73:39 - braces d
73:40 - not tap like this and it's gonna remove
73:42 - our hello text from there let me let us
73:46 - see okay you
73:47 - previously we had the hello text now it
73:50 - is gone
73:51 - come back to vs code
73:53 - now target the remaining three other
73:55 - text in order to do that write and two
73:59 - comma and
74:00 - hyphen three comma and hyphen four okay
74:04 - curly braces like this and we're gonna
74:06 - set the font size to 30 pixels f size
74:10 - tab 30 pixels ctrl s
74:13 - now let's see our result it looks
74:15 - beautiful
74:16 - this is the mobile version if you resize
74:18 - it
74:19 - it's going to give us the
74:21 - tablet version over here let's go to the
74:23 - 4k it looks quite beautiful for the 4k
74:25 - version you can also customize the gaps
74:28 - as you like it is completely up to you
74:30 - if you resize the window then it looks
74:33 - beautiful and it resizes when we resize
74:36 - the window
74:38 - perfectly fine this is the 4k view
74:41 - this is the large laptop view this is
74:44 - the laptop view of 1024 pixels the
74:48 - tablet view you can click this guides
74:51 - over here and it's gonna
74:53 - show us the result accordingly and then
74:56 - the mobile view this is the large if you
74:59 - resize it then it looks quite good as
75:01 - well
75:02 - i hope you understood the second project
75:04 - now let's start the third and last
75:06 - project
75:07 - on the third project we're gonna be
75:09 - building this layout over here so get
75:11 - your vs code ready now come back to vs
75:13 - code and remove everything we don't need
75:15 - anything we ctrl s
75:17 - delete ctrl s okay
75:19 - and on the index what we are going to do
75:22 - is we are going to remove the
75:24 - container from here
75:26 - because there is a lot of code and you
75:28 - write container again dot
75:30 - container tab okay after removing
75:34 - everything inside
75:36 - the previous container okay container
75:38 - and now what we're gonna do is we're
75:40 - gonna create three rows why is that if
75:42 - you go back to our design
75:44 - um
75:46 - not here sorry
75:49 - uh this one
75:51 - if you come back to our design we're
75:53 - gonna create three roles right now
75:54 - because we have
75:56 - row one
75:57 - row two row three that's why so come
76:00 - back to vs code
76:02 - uh maximize this
76:04 - you can write first of all dot row
76:07 - one
76:10 - okay in order to write it quickly you
76:12 - write star three tap okay
76:14 - so we have
76:16 - uh row one
76:18 - two three okay and now inside the rows
76:21 - we're gonna create three boxes okay
76:24 - in order to do that write dot vox
76:28 - hyphen star three tab okay we write one
76:31 - two three and inside here you write a
76:36 - b
76:37 - and c over here
76:39 - all right similarly on the row two and
76:42 - row three we're gonna create boxes and
76:44 - then inside there we're gonna create
76:46 - letters okay dot box
76:49 - hyphen star three tap
76:52 - four five six
76:55 - d
76:57 - a
76:59 - f over here
77:01 - and
77:02 - on the last row dot box
77:06 - hyphen star three tab
77:09 - seven eight nine
77:12 - g
77:13 - h
77:15 - i okay ctrl s let's go back to our
77:17 - browser and see what we have created so
77:19 - far and it looks quite horrible but
77:22 - don't worry don't panic we're gonna
77:24 - style them now come to our browse
77:27 - vs code come over here you write star
77:30 - first of all remove all the default
77:32 - browser settings okay m0px
77:35 - tap p0px tab both side tab bobo tab
77:41 - okay
77:42 - body say to ff tap
77:45 - sense i actually did a mistake deleting
77:48 - the previous styles of our css we should
77:51 - we should have not deleted everything
77:53 - my apologies my bad and now for the font
77:56 - size we're going to set it to 55 pixels
77:58 - so that you can actually see what is
78:00 - happening
78:01 - f size tab 55 pixels control s let's go
78:05 - back to the browser and see what is
78:07 - happening
78:08 - there we go we have it
78:11 - now what you're gonna do is we're gonna
78:12 - individually target container row and
78:15 - box in order to do that you write dot
78:17 - container
78:19 - curly braces dot
78:21 - row
78:22 - curly braces oh no not this one sorry
78:27 - you write square bracket
78:29 - plus
78:30 - power sign equal to double quotes you
78:33 - write row hyphen okay curly braces and
78:36 - it's gonna target all our rows in order
78:39 - to target all the boxes
78:41 - curly braces sorry it's square bracket
78:44 - class
78:45 - power sign equal to
78:46 - box
78:48 - hyphen curly braces okay
78:51 - now the very first thing we're to
78:53 - position our
78:55 - letters from being in a column shape to
78:57 - a row shape in order to do that
79:00 - maximize this
79:01 - later the letters are inside the box and
79:04 - the box are inside the row okay
79:07 - so inside the row here
79:09 - so what you're going to write is d
79:11 - flex not this one sorry d flex tab
79:15 - display flex set the flex direction to
79:18 - row like this and
79:20 - the rows are inside the column okay
79:23 - sorry the rows are inside the container
79:25 - and inside the container the rows should
79:28 - behave like a column in order to do that
79:31 - d
79:33 - flex tab
79:34 - flex direction set it to column like
79:38 - this ctrl s let's go back
79:40 - ah it looks quite good
79:43 - and now we want to create boxes around
79:45 - our letters
79:47 - so first things first what we're gonna
79:48 - do is we are going to set the height of
79:50 - our container in order to do that we
79:52 - write height 100 vh control s and now in
79:56 - order to create the boxes we have to set
79:59 - the color first so bgc tap
80:01 - c4 c4
80:04 - okay ctrl s
80:06 - and now let's see what we have created
80:08 - so far
80:11 - oh it looks quite terrible over here but
80:13 - don't worry and what we're gonna do is
80:16 - we're gonna set the width of this
80:18 - individual boxes and the height so in
80:21 - order to do that you're gonna write
80:23 - width
80:26 - so first of all bracket and right
80:28 - hundred percent and in total how many
80:30 - boxes do we have we have three boxes so
80:33 - divide the entire screen with divided by
80:36 - three
80:37 - for one column i mean for one row okay
80:42 - then
80:43 - save it let's go back to the browser and
80:45 - see what we have created this is the
80:47 - result so far
80:49 - and let's create some border so that we
80:51 - can see what is happening
80:53 - so border
80:56 - two pixels solid black
81:00 - like this ctrl s and we also need to set
81:03 - the height as well so height will be in
81:05 - the similar calculation 100
81:08 - divided by 3 that's because we have
81:10 - three boxes three rows three by three
81:12 - columns i mean three by three
81:14 - grid layout ctrl s
81:17 - and let's go back to the browser and it
81:20 - looks quite terrible why is that oh i
81:23 - made a mistake over here it's not
81:24 - percentage value it's gonna be viewport
81:27 - height or vh so
81:30 - write vh over here and let's see what is
81:32 - happening oh it looks perfect in order
81:35 - to position the text at the very center
81:37 - what you have to write is
81:39 - come over to the box at the bottom you
81:41 - write d
81:43 - great or you can also use the flexbox
81:46 - model as well
81:48 - but i'm going to use the grid place
81:50 - items right center
81:53 - control s let's see what we have done ah
81:55 - it looks perfect as well
81:57 - now we're gonna create some gap between
81:59 - the rows okay this is row one row two
82:02 - and this is row three okay
82:04 - between the rows is gonna be 30 pixels
82:07 - gap in order to do that you write
82:09 - gap uh 30 pixels over here control s
82:12 - let's see what we have created we have
82:15 - gap between rows okay but we also need
82:17 - gap between our columns okay i mean our
82:20 - boxes in order to do that come here uh
82:23 - to the box not to the box but inside the
82:26 - row uh you write cap
82:29 - 30 pixels okay ctrl s let's see what we
82:31 - have created
82:33 - ah it looks quite good but if you want
82:35 - to give some margin around our uh entire
82:38 - container what we can do is you come to
82:41 - at the very top over here you can write
82:44 - five pixels of margin just resize it and
82:47 - looks you can change the value as how
82:49 - much you like but for this i'm going to
82:51 - set it to 5 pixels okay
82:53 - but let's actually set it to a little
82:56 - bit more let's do 30 pixels and let's
82:58 - see what happens
83:00 - it looks quite horrible oh my god let's
83:02 - set it to 10 pixels and let's see it
83:05 - looks good not quite bad not quite good
83:08 - it looks optimum no worries
83:12 - and now if we set
83:14 - and now if we click f12
83:16 - we can see that it looks quite ugly if
83:18 - we resize it we want to make a desktop
83:22 - version for this layout so let's set our
83:25 - standards to um 650 pixels okay on 650
83:29 - pixels we're going to create this layer
83:31 - over here the mobile layer so in order
83:33 - to do that
83:34 - um
83:37 - come back to vs code over here at the
83:40 - very bottom okay over here you're gonna
83:42 - write at the red media
83:46 - and set the max width
83:49 - to
83:50 - 650 pixels like this curly braces and
83:53 - first things first let's understand the
83:55 - theory okay the rows are behaving like a
83:58 - column okay which is the behavior we
84:01 - want on a mobile version but the boxes
84:03 - are behaving like a column but we want
84:05 - the boxes to behave like a row like this
84:08 - so we need to change the behavior of our
84:10 - boxes i mean the rows okay
84:12 - in order to do that um come to our media
84:15 - query over here and you target the rows
84:18 - okay
84:19 - class
84:21 - power sign equal to
84:22 - double quotes
84:24 - row
84:25 - hyphen okay so your bases and you set
84:29 - the
84:30 - flex direction to
84:34 - column like this okay ctrl s and let's
84:36 - see what happens
84:41 - resize it ah it looks quite good
84:44 - it is actually not behaving
84:47 - as expected so in order to change it
84:49 - come back to our
84:51 - vs code you remove this line of code
84:53 - from here we don't need it okay keep it
84:56 - keep the container inside the media
84:58 - query blank and come at the very bottom
85:00 - over here you write called square
85:03 - bracket class
85:04 - power sign equal to double quotes and
85:07 - you target the box i mean all the boxes
85:10 - and we're gonna set the width to 100
85:12 - percent previously it was 33.33 let me
85:16 - show you if you scroll up
85:18 - uh above the media query it was the box
85:21 - over here the width and height was 33.33
85:24 - sorry point three three percentages each
85:27 - now we're gonna set it to maximum which
85:29 - is 100 percent
85:31 - over here okay so ctrl s
85:33 - resize the window let's see what happens
85:35 - ah it looks quite good as well
85:39 - uh let me resize the window okay it is
85:42 - behaving as expected i actually
85:44 - mistakenly uncommented the margin from
85:47 - here
85:48 - let me just bring it back besides the
85:51 - window it looks quite good
85:56 - and you can see the results so this is
85:58 - the mobile version so we have
86:00 - successfully completed our third project
86:03 - so we're done with the tutorial if you
