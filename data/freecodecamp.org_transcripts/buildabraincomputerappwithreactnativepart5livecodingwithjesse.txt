00:04 - hey everybody
00:05 - it's jesse welcome to live coding with
00:07 - jesse
00:09 - and we have a lot to do today i want to
00:11 - get this app
00:13 - submitted to
00:14 - the app store today
00:17 - and i'd love to do it while i'm on the
00:18 - stream
00:20 - uh so i think
00:23 - let's see
00:27 - so if y'all can hear me put something in
00:30 - the chat
00:31 - the um
00:33 - live stream is
00:35 - analytics look a little bit weird
00:37 - uh
00:38 - but let me know
00:41 - uh otherwise i'm gonna get started i see
00:44 - there's a lot of people in the chat
00:45 - saying hello so hey everybody
00:48 - just a quick um
00:50 - a quick intro
00:52 - we've been working on this app for this
00:54 - is the fifth live stream all right cool
00:56 - looks like you can hear me for some
00:57 - reason my um
00:59 - video preview
01:01 - in the um
01:02 - like the stream settings panel is saying
01:04 - the video is private
01:06 - uh which is really odd since obviously
01:08 - you all are in the chat
01:10 - but i've never had it show that before
01:12 - all right so
01:14 - we've been working on this app for five
01:16 - live streams now and um
01:21 - we are using
01:23 - we're connecting a react native app
01:26 - that's built with expo
01:29 - with a brain computer interface
01:31 - called the
01:33 - notion by
01:34 - a startup company called neurocity
01:37 - and we've successfully connected it so
01:40 - that
01:41 - it
01:42 - measures we wear this device it measures
01:44 - our level of focus and when we drop
01:46 - below a certain level the screen changes
01:49 - to red and it makes the device vibrate
01:53 - so
01:54 - just really kind of like bare
01:57 - uh essential functionality
01:59 - and now i want to actually put it out
02:01 - there so we can test it on devices
02:04 - so we got a lot to do before we can put
02:06 - it out there and i've been going over
02:08 - some of the documentation just so that i
02:11 - have some idea of this process this is
02:13 - my very first time actually publishing
02:16 - so i've i've made a few apps that that
02:18 - definitely work and i can run on devices
02:21 - but i've never actually gone through the
02:22 - step of putting it out to the app store
02:24 - and there's a few extra things you need
02:26 - to do to get your app from working to
02:29 - publishable so that's what we're going
02:31 - to do today
02:32 - i'm going to set a
02:35 - a timer
02:36 - and
02:38 - here on one of my other screens
02:41 - and when that timer goes off so it's
02:43 - going to be 25 minutes when that timer
02:44 - goes off i'm going to go over to the
02:45 - live chat i'm going to answer some
02:46 - questions so there's a lot of you in the
02:48 - chat i see you and i'm not going to
02:52 - ignore you forever
02:53 - i'm just going to focus on doing the
02:56 - work for about 25 minutes and then i'm
02:57 - going to go to the chat answer as many
02:59 - questions as i can so feel free to ask
03:01 - as many questions as you want in the
03:03 - chat i will get to them and
03:05 - you know keep it keep it positive and
03:07 - try to keep the spam down uh the last
03:10 - couple of streams it's been a little bit
03:11 - weird we've had a lot of uh people
03:13 - spamming the chat and by that i mean
03:16 - they're just they keep saying the same
03:18 - things over and over again or just
03:20 - typing in a bunch of nonsense over and
03:21 - over again it makes it really hard to
03:23 - read the chat for everybody watching so
03:26 - try to keep that to a minimum uh if i
03:28 - see that you're doing that then i will
03:32 - um
03:33 - stop you from being in the chat
03:35 - so
03:37 - uh i really i won't even mention
03:39 - anything like i'm just gonna stop you
03:40 - from being in the chat so
03:42 - um
03:43 - there's not gonna really be a warning i
03:45 - don't have time
03:47 - for that
03:48 - especially if we get a lot of people in
03:49 - the stream like we have right now so
03:52 - um
03:53 - if it gets too bad i might have a
03:55 - moderator
03:56 - but really it's never been a problem
03:58 - before i mean we've done like literally
04:00 - hundreds of streams and it's only been
04:02 - the last few streams it's been a problem
04:04 - so
04:05 - obviously any type of like bad language
04:08 - or you know saying mean things to each
04:10 - other stuff like that you're gonna be
04:12 - out of the chat so let's keep it all
04:14 - positive
04:15 - okay
04:16 - all right so let's get started
04:18 - if you want to try to follow along this
04:20 - project is on github i believe i put a
04:23 - link in the description to the the code
04:25 - on github so you can check out the code
04:27 - i'm also going to be on
04:29 - [Music]
04:30 - the
04:31 - on expo so their documentation let me
04:34 - put the link to the docs
04:36 - that i'm using
04:38 - in the
04:40 - chat so i got a lot of these windows
04:43 - open for things that we need to do
04:45 - and so i'm going to be jumping around a
04:47 - little bit
04:49 - but this is where i started at the link
04:52 - i just put in the chat
04:54 - so
04:55 - this started this is where i started
04:57 - we're going to start from here so we're
04:58 - starting with um
05:00 - deploying the app
05:02 - right so from deploying the app
05:04 - i believe i went to distributing
05:07 - or deploying
05:10 - yeah this is the distributing so we need
05:12 - to create native builds
05:16 - so to build the app
05:19 - i told you there's gonna be a lot of
05:20 - jumping around here the docs for expo
05:22 - are actually really good but it's
05:24 - there's a lot of steps here
05:26 - so
05:28 - we we've
05:29 - i believe we do have the expo cli
05:32 - installed
05:34 - um
05:35 - already which actually i can let me
05:37 - double check that now
05:40 - make sure i have it installed
05:46 - i know i have installed one of my
05:47 - machines i actually might not have it on
05:49 - this one so we might need to do that
05:52 - whoops
06:02 - let's make some space here because we're
06:04 - going to be in the in the terminal a bit
06:06 - more than normal so i want to see all
06:08 - right it looks like
06:10 - yeah we have this installed otherwise we
06:12 - wouldn't be getting all of this stuff
06:14 - so
06:15 - yeah
06:17 - i believe we have
06:18 - this expo
06:28 - now it says for windows users
06:30 - we need to have um
06:34 - wsl enabled
06:37 - so we need to do that so this step if
06:40 - you're on a mac or if you're on linux
06:42 - you probably won't need to do this step
06:43 - if you're on windows you need to do this
06:45 - step so let's do this
06:47 - um so i have the documentation open
06:49 - already for this we need to install the
06:51 - windows uh
06:52 - subsystem
06:53 - uh for linux so
06:56 - i'll make this a bit bigger
06:58 - i've never done this before let's see
07:00 - let's see if it works
07:01 - so we need to copy this and run it in
07:03 - powershell as an admin so let's try to
07:06 - open
07:08 - windows powershell and let's see if we
07:11 - can run as administrator
07:14 - yes all right so we're running
07:17 - powershell as an admin
07:19 - let's see if i can make it bigger all
07:21 - right i don't know how to make it make
07:22 - the text bigger but i'm just copying and
07:24 - pasting
07:25 - what i just got out of this window on
07:28 - the right hand side
07:30 - and
07:32 - enable windows optional feature
07:35 - cool all right so it looks like it's
07:36 - doing something here
07:40 - let's see do you want to restart the
07:42 - computer to complete operation now oh no
07:44 - i gotta restart
07:48 - i was afraid this was gonna happen
07:50 - ah it does it says restart right there
07:53 - i didn't i was reading through all these
07:54 - documents as fast as i could right
07:56 - before this and i didn't see a restart
07:58 - all right it looks like we're going to
07:59 - have to restart so here's what i'm going
08:01 - to do
08:02 - i'm going to restart which basically the
08:04 - stream is just going to freeze up for
08:05 - like a second the restarts on this
08:08 - machine because it's pretty new are
08:09 - actually very quick
08:11 - so um
08:13 - let's just get it over with now
08:16 - um let's restart i should be back hang
08:18 - in there for maybe like
08:20 - i don't know two minutes at the most and
08:22 - um
08:24 - and we'll do this restart
09:43 - all right cool can you all hear me now
09:45 - am i back
09:49 - it looks like i'm back
09:50 - so uh
09:58 - i'm gonna keep going
10:00 - all right sweet back up yeah actually
10:03 - the the thing that took me the longest
10:04 - that was a really quick restart was that
10:06 - it restarted me and um
10:08 - by default my youtube account is set to
10:10 - my personal account so it tried to log
10:13 - me back into the free code camp um
10:15 - control panel
10:17 - but it wouldn't let me in because i
10:18 - wasn't free code camp so
10:21 - um i switched to my phone for a second
10:23 - just to give you all an update
10:25 - but anyway it's working now so let me
10:28 - turn the stream off on my phone
10:31 - and
10:32 - let's bring to get rid of my vpn and
10:36 - bring up my code
10:39 - sweet
10:43 - actually honestly like
10:45 - uh if you get a good windows system
10:48 - uh restarts are really fast it used to
10:50 - be windows for like super hard to
10:53 - restart
10:55 - sweet
10:56 - um
10:57 - looks like there's a vs code extension
10:59 - for the windows linux subsystem so i'm
11:02 - just going to install it
11:05 - because it seems like
11:14 - cool i'll read about more about that
11:16 - later on
11:17 - um but i guess it's good to have
11:21 - semantic highlighting has been applied
11:23 - sweets
11:27 - all right
11:28 - so now that we have that we can continue
11:30 - on we need to install a linux
11:32 - distribution i think i'm gonna go with
11:34 - uh ubuntu because that's what i'm used
11:36 - to using
11:38 - uh out of out of any linux distro um i
11:41 - don't really know if anybody has any
11:43 - suggestions as to whether to install
11:45 - ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 let me know in the
11:49 - chat i've used 16 more often
11:52 - um
11:53 - but i don't really know what the
11:55 - difference is in upgrading to 18 so
11:58 - i'm gonna have to make a decision here
12:00 - in like
12:01 - three minutes so just let me know
12:12 - let's go 16 or 18.
12:14 - all right so
12:16 - looks like we got one vote for 18. i'll
12:18 - go with 18. i mean honestly it's
12:20 - obviously the the new the newer version
12:22 - so may as well go with the newer version
12:24 - i'm open this in a new window so i can
12:25 - keep the documentation open
12:29 - and uh let's read the next it looks like
12:31 - we open it up we just get it
12:33 - it installs it and then we initialize
12:36 - which i already have those that
12:38 - documentation open as well so we'll do
12:40 - the initialization it looks like
12:41 - everybody's saying 18.
12:43 - cool
12:45 - gam002 says do debian it's the most
12:49 - stable
12:51 - if i had more time to research maybe i'd
12:53 - think about debian but for right now
12:55 - like it's been a while since i used
12:57 - ubuntu but i'm more familiar with all
12:59 - the commands and stuff so i think i'm
13:00 - just gonna go with ubuntu not i don't
13:02 - really think
13:04 - that we're gonna have to do that much
13:05 - with it i think it just needs to be
13:07 - installed to do the rest of the steps
13:08 - for expo
13:09 - um
13:11 - but let's get that and get it started
13:14 - yeah let's open microsoft store
13:20 - get it
13:25 - install
13:34 - all right it's going pretty quick it
13:35 - doesn't seem like it'll be too too much
13:37 - longer so once we get this we need to
13:39 - initialize so let's look at these steps
13:41 - while we're waiting for the install
13:43 - and um
13:52 - all right so we'll launch it
13:53 - and
13:56 - i need to set up an account
14:02 - update and upgrade the packages
14:04 - hopefully this doesn't take too long
14:10 - and that's it
14:11 - all right that's that's pretty seems
14:13 - pretty easy
14:14 - um we probably can just get that started
14:16 - and then move on to another step and
14:18 - while we're waiting for that to finish
14:20 - this is uh really sweet um
14:25 - uh colors they got look at this they got
14:27 - the weather on here i wonder how they
14:29 - had that all set up
14:30 - anyway that's pretty cool
14:33 - this is kind of cool i'm actually glad
14:34 - i'm getting installed i'm installing
14:36 - this i'm going to probably play around
14:37 - with this
14:39 - after the stream
14:41 - um
14:42 - okay cool
14:45 - so almost done with the uh installation
14:48 - looks like maybe 75 of the way down
14:50 - there
14:51 - so we'll get to that in a second i think
14:54 - we can get rid of this step we can get
14:56 - rid of this step now
14:58 - and what else can we get rid of
15:02 - yay
15:03 - all right so let's launch it
15:06 - so installing this may take a few
15:08 - minutes so not a problem we got other
15:10 - steps that we can do that don't depend
15:11 - on the step yet
15:14 - so
15:15 - there's a guide here to deploying to the
15:19 - app stores
15:21 - and
15:23 - there's a lot of stuff making sure it
15:24 - works on different phones
15:26 - i'm gonna skip over a lot of that
15:28 - because really
15:30 - this for this first mvp launch like it
15:34 - just needs to work on my phone all right
15:36 - that was really fast enter a new
15:38 - username
15:41 - alright
15:42 - i'm just going to enter
15:46 - my name
15:48 - and
15:49 - i'm going to create a password with
15:52 - lastpass
16:05 - [Music]
16:15 - and let's paste that in there
16:18 - see if it lets me paste
16:22 - cool
16:25 - what
16:28 - all right so i guess it's not allowing
16:30 - copy and paste
16:31 - so
16:32 - i'm just gonna have to type in a
16:33 - password
16:43 - all right cool
16:45 - sweet so we're in now we need to do
16:48 - our app get
16:50 - so
16:52 - we're gonna copy this we're gonna do
16:53 - sudo which like lets you run as an admin
16:56 - and then update and
16:58 - uh upgrade all our apps
17:00 - let's paste that
17:02 - why is it not letting me paste anything
17:06 - dang it
17:08 - all right well i'll just type it then
17:11 - sudo apps
17:15 - upgrade
17:25 - oops i messed it up update
17:29 - and
17:36 - upgrade
17:42 - all right cool
17:43 - that's doing its thing
17:46 - oh looks like uh sameep says control
17:49 - shift
17:50 - copy and paste for copy and pasting and
17:52 - linux terminal oh and michael says to
17:54 - all right sweet thank you for that
17:57 - i will definitely
17:59 - be using that in the future
18:02 - all right so we just need to wait for
18:03 - that and
18:05 - one of the next steps we need to have is
18:07 - an app icon and a splash screen so
18:12 - i'm going to go with the
18:14 - um it says we need to provide something
18:16 - that's at least 512 by 512 pixels
18:20 - um but we need uh 1024 by 1024 for ios
18:24 - so eventually we're going to be on ios
18:26 - so i think we're just going to go with
18:27 - 1024x1024
18:30 - i do you want to continue
18:32 - yes let's continue
18:36 - so
18:40 - i have a free
18:44 - um image editing software
18:47 - called uh so g-i-m-p
18:50 - i'm just gonna use that
18:52 - let's see
18:53 - i think i already started a didn't save
18:57 - i started like right before the stream a
18:59 - template but
19:01 - we can just create it again so
19:03 - i'm just going to create one that's the
19:05 - dimensions we want
19:07 - 10 24 by 1024 so now we have this we
19:11 - have our background
19:13 - and uh let's let's just make a solid
19:15 - color background
19:17 - i don't know what color to do
19:19 - uh
19:20 - let's just
19:24 - got it there we go there's our our paint
19:25 - bucket
19:27 - uh
19:28 - color fill
19:30 - there's a pattern fill
19:32 - well what patterns can we do
19:38 - background background color fill fill
19:40 - whole selection
19:41 - all right
19:43 - what colors right now we have black and
19:45 - red
19:46 - or black and white let's change it to
19:48 - something else
19:50 - um
19:51 - how about just this blue color let's use
19:53 - blue
19:54 - i think our buttons blue in our app so
19:56 - that's like the only color we're using
19:58 - other than like the the red color so
20:00 - let's do that
20:03 - oops
20:04 - why is that not filling
20:08 - um
20:11 - there we go
20:12 - all right so we got our color here
20:14 - let's make a new layer
20:17 - a new layer
20:19 - and let's call this layer text
20:23 - and inside our text layer
20:26 - let's add a text box
20:30 - and
20:31 - i'm just going to type in our text box
20:33 - um
20:37 - s f
20:41 - and the color we're gonna
20:43 - we're gonna make the color white
20:45 - so we can actually see it
20:47 - and let's make the text like
20:49 - i don't know like 100 pixels
20:52 - and let's use
20:55 - um
20:57 - there we go let's use this font
21:02 - i don't know why i can't see it
21:14 - oops because the color got changed
21:27 - there we go
21:34 - you can tell i'm not like
21:36 - i'm not at all very skilled at this kind
21:39 - of work so
21:41 - my icon is just going to be letters
21:45 - and we're just gonna make big letters
21:53 - on a background
21:55 - because i i'm not skilled at anything
21:58 - artistic so eventually it'd be cool to
22:01 - like get a real icon but for right now i
22:04 - just need to get something done
22:07 - actually let me let me check back in on
22:08 - this linux thing
22:10 - cool looks like everything ran all right
22:12 - so i think we're we're good and we're
22:14 - good with linux i'm gonna leave it open
22:15 - just in case there's another step that i
22:17 - forgot about but i think we're good and
22:20 - everything's fine for that step of
22:22 - getting the linux distro running
22:24 - uh so let's see
22:27 - that looks like
22:29 - pretty much in the center i'm not too
22:31 - worried about it
22:33 - so we can export this as so we can do is
22:37 - first first thing we can do is save and
22:39 - let's save this as
22:41 - just sf.xcf so that way we can come in
22:44 - and edit it if we need to
22:47 - and then we're going to export it
22:49 - as a ping
22:51 - so sf.png
22:57 - okay so we have that exported

23:12 - the chat
23:14 - i'm gonna answer some questions when we
23:15 - come back we're gonna take this same
23:17 - design here and just change the
23:19 - dimensions and we're gonna make a splash
23:21 - screen
23:22 - and then we should have everything we
23:24 - need to go forward with
23:26 - doing our first like build
23:29 - maybe we might use the android simulator
23:31 - in android studio to do one test run
23:33 - before we actually deploy it but we're
23:35 - getting close to being able to deploy
23:37 - this
23:38 - all right so let's see
23:39 - the chat

24:05 - they're asking like in this live stream
24:06 - will you learn web development um this
24:08 - one
24:09 - probably not because we're doing a lot
24:11 - of like setup work there's not really a
24:13 - lot of code going on in this stream
24:16 - but in the previous streams we do a lot
24:17 - more code so you might learn a little
24:19 - bit more uh from that
24:21 - uh
24:23 - let's see
24:25 - uh i'm a full stack mern web developer

25:45 - you know try to help help out where you
25:47 - can
25:54 - all right
25:59 - someone asked what coding language this
26:00 - is uh the app is built with javascript
26:03 - so with uh react native
26:05 - all right somebody's
26:08 - spam in the chat see let's uh
26:12 - we're gonna hide that so
26:15 - let's see
26:23 - amir asks if there's a playlist of this
26:25 - you know what now that we have uh you
26:27 - know we're up to five streams now uh i
26:29 - think i will make a playlist of this so
26:31 - that'll be coming i'll try to make a
26:33 - playlist at some point today for it
26:37 - someone asks what this app will be able
26:38 - to do
26:40 - um
26:42 - this app will be able to track the level
26:44 - of focus that you currently have on
26:46 - whatever you're doing and then warn you
26:48 - when your level of focus is dropping
26:55 - uh charbelle says what are you using for
26:57 - rendering react native
26:59 - um i'm not i'm not exactly sure what you
27:02 - mean by rendering react native but uh we
27:04 - use um expo
27:07 - uh
27:08 - so that's
27:10 - i don't know if that's exactly what you
27:11 - mean but that
27:13 - let me know if that answers your
27:14 - question
27:18 - uh benson asks if it's morning or night
27:20 - uh it's
27:21 - 12 30 p.m where i'm at right now
27:32 - uh bloody creature says uh don't waste
27:35 - your time self-taught programming takes
27:36 - too long
27:38 - um well it does take a while but uh i
27:41 - don't think it's a waste of time like to
27:43 - be honest with you um teaching myself to
27:45 - program was a huge thing like
27:48 - in terms of being able to provide for my
27:50 - family like
27:51 - if you take like the job i had before i
27:54 - started to teach myself programming and
27:56 - the job i have now i make about five
27:58 - times as much money per year now as i
28:01 - did before
28:03 - and that was just from self-taught
28:05 - programming so it took me a while took
28:08 - me a couple years i didn't get there
28:10 - overnight i had
28:11 - jobs in between
28:13 - um but
28:15 - you know it's it definitely is better
28:17 - like
28:18 - you know i didn't have to spend any
28:19 - money on going to university
28:22 - uh or all that time i was able to make
28:24 - money the whole time so uh i don't think
28:27 - self-taught programming it takes too
28:29 - long or is a waste of time is actually
28:32 - a really good way for me to keep working
28:35 - and keep learning and keep paying the
28:37 - bills and providing for my family
28:40 - without having to go into debt from
28:41 - student loans and stuff and now like
28:44 - uh i'm i'm very lucky i'm i'm able to
28:47 - make more money you know from my family
28:50 - than i ever thought i would be able to
28:53 - so
28:54 - yeah it worked out for me
29:03 - let's see
29:04 - a lot of people are asking like what
29:06 - we're doing for this app so i explained
29:08 - that a couple times already so um i
29:10 - guess if if you're just joining and you
29:12 - didn't hear the explanations you can
29:13 - always rewind it like before beforehand
29:16 - in the uh stream to hear the explanation
29:19 - and then come back to the
29:20 - like what we're doing now um if you're
29:23 - joining a little bit late and want to
29:24 - catch up you can always like
29:26 - rewind the stream to the beginning and
29:28 - then play it on double speed and then
29:30 - you'll you'll get everything that
29:31 - happened and you'll catch up with us uh
29:33 - on the live so i recommend doing that if
29:36 - if you join like in the middle and
29:37 - you're totally lost that's a good option
29:43 - let's see
29:45 - blazing up says never even heard of
29:47 - react native before is it good um i i
29:50 - think it's good i think if you already
29:51 - know javascript uh then it's a really
29:54 - really good way to build
29:57 - native apps
29:58 - [Music]
29:59 - without having to learn different
30:01 - languages
30:02 - for android and ios
30:07 - oh no my timer quit again
30:09 - all right that's it i'm done with this
30:11 - timer this is like three streams in a
30:13 - row now that my timer quit working
30:16 - so i gotta find a new timer
30:18 - that one is just not working for us
30:22 - i thought it had been a long time here
30:25 - all right so i didn't get through all
30:26 - the questions i'm going to stop and get
30:28 - back to the code now uh i'll come back
30:30 - to the questions though
30:35 - all right so we've saved this as our app
30:38 - icon now we need to do a
30:41 - um
30:42 - let's find this
30:47 - we need to do
30:48 - a splash screen which i also have up
30:51 - here
30:53 - actually well let's let's uh upload this
30:55 - while we're waiting
30:57 - so i found this this site which is app
30:59 - icon generator which you upload your
31:01 - icon in 1024 by 1024 pixels and then
31:04 - it'll give you icons in different sizes
31:07 - and files so uh let's let's do that um
31:11 - we're going to name it
31:16 - so let's upload our file which we named
31:24 - what do we name it
31:28 - it should be right here
31:31 - unless it went to a different
31:33 - folder
31:36 - now the default folder to save those
31:38 - files is right here
31:40 - that's really odd
31:42 - let's look in our our folder system then
31:56 - that's weird let me export it again
32:00 - see where it went
32:01 - sf.png
32:04 - oh it went into documents that's weird
32:07 - for some reason the default folder was
32:09 - documents
32:16 - all right so we'll go to documents
32:20 - [Music]
32:22 - sf
32:25 - area
32:26 - and i want to name it the same thing
32:28 - that we have
32:29 - in
32:31 - our app currently just to like save time
32:34 - so it's icon.png
32:42 - generate these i'm not going to worry
32:43 - about the ios stuff for now
32:46 - we'll do
32:48 - um probably like a different stream at
32:50 - some point and do the ios build and
32:53 - everything
32:54 - uh
32:55 - all right so we have our icons and i
32:58 - want to
32:59 - unzip these
33:01 - oops
33:04 - i think i opened this twice yeah i did
33:06 - all right so
33:11 - what did it send me
33:14 - wow
33:16 - send a lot of different files here let's
33:18 - let's see what the heck it said
33:24 - i just want
33:29 - that's crazy all right well let's just
33:30 - extract them all for now
33:35 - so we can take a look at them here see
33:38 - what we want
33:40 - bring this over
33:42 - app icons
33:44 - all right so this one looks like
33:46 - play store that's what we really want
33:49 - uh so i'm just gonna grab that one i
33:52 - think
33:57 - yeah for now i'm just grabbing this one
33:59 - i think we just need one for now
34:03 - i actually think
34:05 - what is the difference with this
34:12 - yeah maybe we didn't need to do that
34:21 - you know what
34:23 - i'm not going to use those
34:25 - i thought we'd we'd get like different
34:27 - ones that would have been that would
34:28 - have worked but i think i'm just going
34:30 - to
34:32 - pull over uh the file that we made
34:35 - so in our documents
34:39 - and
34:40 - so we have this sf
34:43 - and i'm gonna pull that over to our
34:45 - assets
34:47 - and
34:49 - i'm going to delete this icon
34:52 - and i'm going to rename this one
34:57 - there we go so now that'll be our icon
35:00 - and we can move on to our splash screen
35:06 - let's see this is the icon page
35:11 - we could just get rid of this page we
35:12 - don't need that anymore
35:14 - uh splash screen okay
35:18 - add a splash screen
35:23 - i thought i had this open already
35:26 - i guess not
35:33 - all right 1242 by 2436.
35:39 - all right now this is for ios but i i
35:41 - read through this a little bit uh
35:43 - earlier i just kind of skimmed through
35:45 - it and i believe this will also work for
35:47 - android
35:48 - so
35:49 - we're gonna we're gonna try to do that
35:51 - as well so let's go back to our image
35:53 - editor
35:55 - there we go yep
35:58 - and
35:59 - let me
36:03 - [Music]
36:04 - i'm gonna pull this out we don't need
36:06 - the full screen
36:07 - i'm gonna shrink it up a little bit so
36:09 - we can see
36:11 - our instructions as well 12 24 okay
36:16 - so let's take our background
36:17 - and let's see if we can resize it
36:39 - oh i don't think i can from there let's
36:41 - talk about let's see if we can do it
36:43 - here
36:47 - image
36:50 - canvas size yeah
36:52 - all right cool let's change the canvas
36:55 - size
36:56 - to
36:58 - we want width to be
37:00 - 1242 pixels and
37:04 - we're going to be 24
37:06 - 36 pixels tall
37:11 - let's resize that and let's let's put
37:13 - the sf part
37:15 - right in the middle
37:21 - that looks
37:23 - that looks okay
37:29 - all right
37:31 - all right cool so now we have um
37:35 - a different size we have our background
37:37 - here let's see if we can fill in our
37:39 - background with
37:44 - with this color i don't know if we can
37:48 - um color
37:51 - yeah it's not gonna let us
37:52 - what do we need to do here
37:56 - let's
38:00 - scale layer
38:02 - change size resize layer to the size of
38:05 - image
38:08 - see if that'll work sweet that works
38:10 - alright cool
38:12 - all right awesome
38:14 - so we resized our background layer now
38:17 - let's export this
38:20 - and let's just export this
38:23 - i guess we could say
38:28 - we'll go sf splash
38:31 - i'm saying sf because i've i've decided
38:33 - to name the app stay focused i don't
38:35 - really know if there's another app named
38:36 - meta or how that works but
38:38 - that's just the name that i uh
38:41 - thought of
38:43 - yep export
38:47 - all right now
38:49 - let's move this over
38:56 - oops
38:58 - oh there it is
39:07 - let's delete our splash
39:09 - and
39:10 - change this to
39:13 - splash
39:14 - [Music]
39:17 - cool
39:20 - all right so
39:22 - we should have what we need and
39:25 - i think our
39:28 - app.json already is showing
39:30 - what we need so yeah
39:32 - so our splash
39:34 - it's already there uh background color
39:39 - actually so let's change our background
39:41 - color to match what we made the
39:42 - background color for our app
39:45 - we should be able to find that out i
39:47 - think from
39:49 - this
39:54 - what's the current there we go
39:58 - there's a hex color
40:04 - cool
40:07 - let's save that
40:09 - that might be the only code change that
40:11 - we need to do
40:17 - all right cool
40:26 - and
40:28 - i think we're just going to leave
40:29 - everything else for the splash screens
40:32 - as
40:34 - like the defaults
40:36 - and we're going to be done with that
40:37 - step
40:39 - and
40:42 - let's see actually we're done with this
40:44 - as well
40:46 - let's get rid of that
40:48 - deploy
40:59 - all right yeah a lot of this stuff
41:07 - i'm not going to worry about for now
41:25 - okay
41:26 - we need android permissions
41:28 - we might need permissions for that
41:30 - vibrate feature
41:45 - yeah let's let's check out our
41:46 - permissions here
42:06 - okay so we do have vibrate
42:09 - all right let's add that then
42:22 - [Music]
42:23 - whoops forget the
42:25 - comma
42:29 - [Music]
42:32 - android and then
42:34 - [Music]
42:40 - permissions
42:42 - and permissions is an array
42:45 - of strings
42:50 - vibrates
42:52 - okay
42:55 - all right so we should be good there
42:57 - let's get rid of that
42:59 - and
43:01 - comment at projections
43:03 - i'm not going to worry about the ad
43:04 - projections until
43:07 - we uh
43:08 - we get rejected so let's get rid of that
43:12 - all right let's talk about
43:14 - okay so
43:15 - way back to where we started here
43:18 - we're still on step one
43:20 - installed it uh install g expo click
43:26 - okay so i am using yarn let's just go
43:29 - ahead and be 100 sure that we have
43:31 - installed this
43:34 - and we're going to do a global install
43:39 - uh it's just gonna work without let's
43:41 - see if it works without me
43:43 - running this as an admin
43:48 - it might give us an error
43:50 - if i'm not an admin
43:54 - if it does no big deal we'll just reopen
43:56 - uh
43:57 - as an admin
44:02 - all right we've already
44:05 - i believe configured app.json
44:09 - well let's see
44:12 - for android at least
44:13 - looks like we're going to need to have a
44:15 - package
44:17 - name and a version code
44:19 - i don't think we have that yet so
44:22 - um
44:23 - let's try that
44:25 - let's create a
44:27 - package
44:31 - and i guess i'll just use the
44:35 - um
44:38 - your company dot your app name
44:41 - um
44:42 - i don't know what my company name is
44:43 - going to be
44:48 - just name it after myself and your app
44:50 - name
44:52 - stay focused
44:55 - and then
44:59 - version
45:04 - code is going to be one this version one
45:09 - there we go
45:10 - save that
45:12 - all right
45:13 - still fetching packages
45:17 - all right we'll give that another minute
45:18 - if nothing happens then maybe i'll stop
45:20 - it and then do it oh cool
45:24 - just being too impatient there looks
45:26 - like it's still doing its thing
45:29 - um
45:30 - see i'll do i'm going to stop maybe in
45:33 - like
45:34 - 10 minutes and get back to some
45:36 - questions so hang in there if you uh if
45:38 - you're asking some questions i will get
45:40 - to the chat again and and like
45:43 - 10 minutes
45:45 - so about 1 p.m eastern time i'm gonna
45:47 - stop and do questions i went over a
45:49 - little bit on the last question so sweet
45:52 - all right so we're definitely installed
45:54 - now
45:55 - it looks like maybe i didn't have uh
45:57 - this installed globally i think maybe i
45:59 - just had it installed uh locally like on
46:01 - this package
46:03 - so good thing we went through that
46:06 - so that should work
46:08 - and
46:13 - name icon and version are required
46:17 - slug is the url name that you ask
46:19 - javascript is pub just publish to
46:24 - let's see if we have
46:26 - slug right stay focused
46:32 - just double checking to make sure we
46:33 - have what we need
46:38 - it looks good i'm not worried about ios
46:40 - for right now
46:46 - uh sdk version do we have that yeah we
46:49 - do okay
46:58 - let's take out ios from our platforms
47:01 - for right now since we're not targeting
47:03 - ios
47:05 - at the moment
47:07 - we'll just do android and web
47:13 - alright
47:14 - we can start the android build
47:23 - uh okay all right this is interesting
47:25 - let's let's take the time to fig to
47:27 - understand this here uh because we are
47:29 - building for android so we can do a
47:31 - build apk or an android app bundle
47:34 - app bundles are recommended but you have
47:37 - to make sure the google play app signing
47:39 - is enabled for your project you can read
47:41 - more about it here
47:48 - okay it looks like we'll need a key
47:50 - store um that they will generate for us
47:53 - which is sweet because i don't know what
47:55 - that is
47:57 - if you let expo generate a key store for
47:59 - you we strongly recommend that you later
48:01 - fetch the key store and back up your key
48:03 - store all right we'll do that and we'll
48:05 - i'll save it in lastpass
48:09 - we'll need that to update the app
48:18 - all right cool let's just get down wait
48:20 - for it to finish building
48:51 - okay
48:52 - so we can call a web hook
48:56 - that'll let us know when the build is
48:58 - done i'm not going to worry about that
49:02 - and we can test it
49:04 - we'll definitely want to test it
49:08 - and then we'll submit it okay so
49:10 - here's what we're going to do first
49:11 - we're going to test uh
49:14 - we're going to test it
49:15 - before we go through the build because
49:17 - the build seems like it may take a
49:19 - little bit
49:20 - but then
49:22 - test and then we'll run this
49:26 - and uh so let's let's do the test
49:30 - and this is going to be
49:32 - actually let's do
49:33 - let's commit the the changes we made
49:38 - we need to get add git commit
49:42 - we have this message uh
49:45 - and um
49:48 - add icons and
49:54 - update app.json
49:56 - we're gonna push that to github
49:59 - so
50:00 - that's push and now let's run yarn start
50:10 - and
50:11 - let's try to run this on
50:14 - the
50:14 - android
50:18 - emulator
50:28 - all right looks like i'll have to start
50:29 - it first so let's do
50:31 - android android studio
50:36 - this would be a nice test of the power
50:39 - of this computer to see if we can run
50:41 - all this um
50:45 - we need to do
50:47 - abd manager and i already set up a uh
50:51 - a test pixel device so let's start that
50:55 - up
50:57 - hey it was already running the previous
50:59 - version before we did all the uh
51:02 - all the updates here
51:05 - all right so now that that's running we
51:06 - should be able to run this again i'm
51:07 - just pressing the a button as a shortcut
51:10 - to start this up i could come over here
51:11 - and press the emulator button
51:14 - all right so now
51:18 - we should get a connection here
51:22 - at some point
51:26 - it's possible that we might need to
51:30 - refresh the app which we can do
51:33 - let's do a refresh now
51:35 - there we go
51:36 - all right so now it's going to load the
51:38 - new stuff
51:39 - sweet
51:40 - um so now we have the new stuff here uh
51:43 - we can try to link let's try to link our
51:45 - device and actually log in once
51:47 - and see if that
51:50 - just to run through make sure we don't
51:51 - get any crazy errors or anything right
51:55 - so i need to go on my other screen here
51:57 - and grab some of my info
52:04 - so i'm going to grab device id
52:07 - and
52:09 - password
52:11 - oops
52:13 - no let me paste
52:17 - it's not letting me paste no
52:19 - there's gotta be
52:20 - there's gotta be a uh setting on here to
52:22 - let me paste stuff in here
52:25 - um
52:28 - there's some is there a keyboard option
52:40 - no
52:41 - all right
52:49 - there we go well at least i found the
52:52 - found the dark theme
52:56 - uh if i have to actually type out this
53:00 - is gonna it's gonna take five minutes to
53:02 - type everything out
53:11 - that's crazy
53:18 - you know what actually
53:19 - there we go there's the paste all right
53:22 - if i hold in for a second it just hit me
53:25 - like oh maybe i have to pace like i do
53:27 - normally on an android device and that's
53:29 - you just hold in
53:31 - the the button like you're tapping like
53:33 - a long tap and then you get paste so
53:37 - crisis averted
53:40 - i just should like not make my password
53:43 - 70 characters long and then maybe i'd be
53:45 - all right
53:49 - i just listened to too many hacker
53:51 - podcasts and now it's made me paranoid
53:53 - about
53:54 - making my passwords very long
53:58 - but i figure like if we're dealing with
53:59 - data from my own brain i should have
54:01 - long passwords right
54:06 - sweet all right let's see so setting a
54:09 - timer for a long period of time multiple
54:11 - minutes is performance correctness issue
54:12 - on android let's read this what it's
54:15 - saying
54:16 - as it keeps the timer module awake and
54:18 - timers can only be called when the app
54:20 - is in the foreground okay that's fine
54:27 - so set timeout do we have a set timeout
54:29 - in our app
54:31 - oops
54:33 - i don't need that
54:41 - all right so we don't actually have a
54:43 - set timeout in our code so i'm guessing
54:45 - that's in maybe one of the packages
54:47 - we're using so can't really do anything
54:49 - about that so i'm gonna
54:51 - i'm gonna dismiss that
54:54 - all right cool so this looks good we're
54:56 - logged in um
54:58 - i don't
54:59 - actually have the
55:01 - headset on so let me let me turn the
55:03 - headset on
55:04 - just so that we can verify like with
55:07 - with data
55:11 - if if we're gonna get um
55:14 - like if it will work with the data once
55:16 - we do that we can actually do the build
55:19 - another way i could test this is i could
55:22 - link i could hook up my android phone
55:25 - by a usb cable to my computer and we
55:28 - could test like that but if i did that
55:30 - you all wouldn't be able to see it so
55:32 - that's why i'm not testing that way we
55:34 - did that a couple of streams ago and it
55:36 - it did work with the previous version of
55:39 - the app none of the logic has really
55:41 - changed too much so i think it's it's
55:43 - fine it'll still work
55:45 - uh what i don't think we can test is the
55:48 - vibration feature
55:49 - so i don't know if we're going to see
55:51 - anything at all when the app is supposed
55:53 - to vibrate
55:54 - um but
55:57 - the uh this notion device is starting
55:59 - this is the brain computer interface
56:00 - i'll put this on in a second and we
56:02 - should see some real data from this
56:05 - as soon as the operating system on this
56:07 - is started then we'll we'll go forward
56:10 - with it
56:11 - while i'm waiting for that which should
56:13 - only be a few more seconds i'll check
56:15 - the chat
56:24 - all right um i got some questions about
56:26 - what am i building it's a brain computer
56:30 - app that checks your level of focus if
56:32 - you want to know more about it you can
56:34 - check out previous streams or
56:36 - go to like the beginning of this stream
56:38 - and you should be able to get
56:40 - a better explanation
56:43 - while i'm waiting for the device to
56:45 - start too i want to remind everybody
56:46 - that if you're interested in this
56:48 - particular device the the notion from
56:50 - neurocity you can check out my youtube
56:53 - channel the links in the description i
56:54 - did a more in-depth review of this
56:57 - device and showed off some of the stuff
56:59 - that it can do
57:00 - so
57:02 - check that out
57:04 - i also do some coding tutorials i just
57:06 - did one on typescript like an intro to
57:08 - typescript i did a video on uh
57:11 - javascript documentation cool it's
57:13 - online so let me put this on
57:17 - so if if you at all like what i'm doing
57:19 - here please check out my my channel as
57:21 - well and i'm trying to do
57:24 - since everybody's in quarantine i'd like
57:26 - to do some type of content probably like
57:29 - a live stream or a video every day i'm
57:31 - going to try to alternate between live
57:32 - streams on free code camp and a video on
57:35 - my own channel
57:36 - so
57:38 - hopefully it's it's helpful to some
57:40 - people especially if you're quarantined
57:41 - by yourself i'm hoping that maybe this
57:44 - is like
57:45 - you know a little bit of interaction
57:47 - with with other developers you know with
57:49 - me and with the people in the live
57:50 - stream
57:51 - um
57:52 - i know it's it's probably tough
57:55 - uh tough for a lot of people right now
57:57 - so
57:58 - i'm not a doctor i'm not a mental health
58:00 - expert uh but i do know how to code so
58:03 - i'm i'm gonna do that
58:05 - all right this looks like it's working
58:07 - so as i suspected we're not really
58:09 - getting the vibration
58:11 - because it's a simulator
58:14 - so
58:15 - but since i successfully tested the
58:17 - vibration
58:18 - before on on a real device then i'm just
58:21 - going to assume that it works
58:24 - so
58:26 - cool
58:27 - that works
58:29 - all right i'm going to test logging out
58:30 - now
58:33 - oh okay you know what when we log out
58:35 - nothing happens on the screen
58:40 - that's interesting
58:45 - i think maybe we should have something
58:46 - happen on the screen otherwise users
58:48 - would have to like close the app
58:50 - something needs to happen let's fix that
58:52 - before we before we do anything else
58:54 - because i think that's that's a big deal
58:56 - i'm going to take this off just for now
58:58 - so i can put my headphones back up
59:00 - um
59:02 - yeah i think that that's actually a pr
59:04 - that would be a pretty annoying thing if
59:06 - the user had to you know like constantly
59:09 - restart
59:10 - every time they want they logged out so
59:13 - uh let's let's fix that
59:16 - now and
59:20 - let's see how we can do that so
59:23 - when we log out
59:25 - what would change
59:27 - so let's see right now the um the login
59:31 - page
59:33 - is shown
59:36 - if we don't have a user
59:40 - so what is logout do
59:42 - so notion log out
59:47 - let's find our logout function
59:56 - oh we just directly call notion.logout
60:01 - let's see what we could do
60:11 - i think if if we create a function
60:14 - that's a log out function
60:17 - and we add notion.log out
60:27 - then
60:28 - we can also manually clear the user
60:32 - and that should that should fix it so
60:35 - let's add a logout function
60:40 - i'm going to do a log out and
60:44 - it's going to take
60:45 - no parameters
60:48 - and
60:50 - we're going to do a notion.log out and
60:53 - we're also going to set user back to
60:56 - let me see what we have
60:59 - we're going to set it back to null
61:04 - oops set user
61:09 - no
61:11 - okay
61:12 - let's save that
61:16 - and see like a lot of stuff is happening
61:19 - here we should be able to see
61:21 - oops
61:23 - permission denied for what
61:30 - let's dismiss all that
61:32 - let's do a refresh
61:34 - [Music]
61:40 - it looks like
61:45 - all right let me uh copy my password
61:47 - again
61:55 - [Music]
62:07 - okay
62:11 - now when we log out this time it should
62:12 - go back to our other screen
62:14 - okay cool it did
62:17 - oh no but we're automatically getting
62:18 - logged in
62:30 - and we're getting
62:31 - we're getting a warning
62:49 - okay let's
62:52 - i think warnings are okay uh and it
62:54 - won't like crash our app so i'm okay
62:56 - with that for right now
62:58 - if we get any
63:00 - any red colored notifications that are
63:02 - errors then i'll be more worried but i
63:04 - do want to see um
63:07 - so we we had the issue of the auto
63:09 - logging in happening
63:11 - and i want to want to make sure that
63:14 - we're not doing that anymore so
63:17 - we had that happening because of uh
63:23 - i believe it was
63:28 - notion login
63:32 - was it this one was automatically
63:34 - logging in
63:37 - i think it was
64:27 - all right let's see um
64:29 - let's see if this will work i'm i'm
64:32 - thinking that if we take out user and
64:35 - set user
64:36 - as
64:37 - things that we need to track in here
64:41 - that
64:43 - that might solve our our issue
64:49 - because this won't reset
64:52 - let's see
65:01 - all right cool so it didn't log us in
65:03 - let's submit this
65:05 - and let's log out
65:07 - cool
65:08 - all right so now
65:10 - everything was still saved which is
65:11 - actually pretty useful um
65:15 - and
65:16 - it's not it's not doing that so let's
65:19 - try to
65:21 - let's manually refresh
65:24 - just to verify
65:31 - all right and the thing is
65:33 - it's making us log in again
65:37 - we did want to avoid that
65:39 - we wanted to avoid having to log in
65:40 - again so i thought we had it
65:43 - we did have it set up so that if we had
65:46 - the device id we would get a new notion
65:49 - and we would set notion
65:57 - which that's actually kind of weird
65:59 - that our auto login is not working
66:03 - let's test this
66:04 - let's run on a web browser too because
66:06 - we had it working on a web browser
66:10 - can't be reached why not
66:34 - okay looks like it's got to build
66:36 - i wonder if i can run it on web and
66:39 - android at the same time
66:41 - all right so this is automatically
66:44 - linking
66:54 - it has it
67:05 - okay
67:08 - all right
67:14 - all right there is some weirdness going
67:16 - on with um
67:20 - automatically starting but at least like
67:22 - it does seem to be saving
67:25 - so it's it's saving the id which i'm
67:28 - okay with that
67:30 - if the user happens to have a password
67:32 - manager they can save their password
67:35 - so
67:36 - i'm okay with that for now
67:41 - all right oops i went over time i'm
67:43 - gonna go back to the chat now i
67:44 - apologize i totally lost track of time i
67:46 - shoulda i should have checked the chat
67:48 - like 10 minutes ago
67:49 - uh so let me go to the chat now and um
67:53 - take about five minutes here in the chat
67:57 - um
68:00 - hey david uh corbin's here he says hey
68:04 - jesse keep up the great work thanks man
68:06 - good to see you in here
68:08 - i work with david he is like a uh a
68:12 - kubernetes expert
68:17 - um
68:19 - moshiko says how do you manage to stay
68:20 - focused over time
68:22 - um
68:23 - i don't know uh
68:24 - i guess uh
68:27 - when i really need to stay focused like
68:28 - i'm gonna be honest i take um
68:31 - i take like a supplement called g fuel
68:33 - that's a bunch of b vitamins and like
68:36 - other vitamins and caffeine and it does
68:38 - help me stay focused so
68:41 - that's that's what i do when i really
68:42 - need to focus um other than that i
68:46 - i don't know i just like take breaks
68:48 - when i need to um
68:52 - yeah
68:54 - uh
68:57 - boym lol says how many years of
69:00 - experience do you have
69:03 - um
69:05 - i don't know it's been a lot it's been a
69:07 - long time it's been a long time
69:09 - maybe seven
69:10 - i'm trying to think back to when i
69:12 - started
69:13 - um
69:15 - from the time when like i actually
69:16 - started getting paid to do coding like
69:18 - consistently i'm gonna say like
69:21 - somewhere around sevenish years
69:27 - uh as she says uh it's my first live
69:30 - session on free code camp oh
69:31 - congratulations welcome thanks for
69:33 - watching
69:36 - uh
69:37 - gamm002 says how many hours of coding
69:39 - experience would you have approximately
69:41 - oh i i have no idea i'd have to do some
69:44 - serious math
69:45 - and an estimation work on that one i
69:48 - don't know i mean i guess like
69:51 - so if i've been coding for about seven
69:52 - years full time
69:55 - then
69:56 - i mean you figure i wouldn't say that i
69:59 - would have like 40 hours a week of
70:00 - coding because so much time is spent in
70:02 - meetings and things like that like
70:04 - let's just be like very conservative in
70:07 - our estimate and say estimate 20 hours a
70:09 - week coding
70:11 - let's factor in vacations and sick days
70:13 - let's say like
70:14 - 20 hours per week coding
70:17 - and 50 weeks a year
70:20 - for seven years
70:21 - so uh let me get my calculator out
70:24 - because i don't want to make
70:26 - simple math mistakes live on youtube
70:29 - right
70:30 - so
70:31 - let's do this 20
70:33 - times 50
70:35 - times seven
70:37 - uh all right we're going to say 7000
70:40 - coding hours
70:43 - so uh
70:45 - i guess that's a lot of hours
70:48 - right
70:49 - and i mean that's definitely a really
70:51 - big estimation right because
70:53 - there were probably some weeks when i
70:55 - did less than that and some weeks when i
70:57 - did more than that
70:59 - but
71:00 - that's my best estimate of of coding
71:03 - which
71:05 - i probably have done more than that
71:08 - because 20 hours a week is not really
71:10 - that much and there's been times when
71:12 - i've been working full-time coding and
71:14 - then also have an extra part-time
71:16 - project on the side
71:19 - but
71:21 - that's
71:22 - that's a decent estimate i'd say i have
71:24 - at least seven 000 coding hours
71:27 - at this point
71:30 - bart says hey from france hey how's it
71:32 - going
71:33 - uh i ir
71:35 - a ayr how do you pronounce ayr but
71:38 - anyway says what resources did you use
71:40 - to study um free code camp so free
71:43 - cocaine.org has a great curriculum
71:45 - which is i really like it i used that i
71:49 - used udacity has free code or free
71:52 - courses a lot of youtube videos
71:54 - there's a youtube channel called learn
71:56 - code academy that i really liked
71:59 - um
72:00 - there's a youtube channel called devtips
72:02 - that i liked to watch um
72:06 - let's see codecademy uh had some great
72:09 - free content
72:10 - and then of course like documentation
72:13 - um stack overflow
72:15 - uh articles and stuff mozilla developer
72:17 - network so those are all like my main my
72:19 - main
72:20 - resources uh
72:22 - yeah
72:24 - let's see and then actually like
72:26 - building projects is a great resource
72:30 - let's see opinion on types
72:33 - so meep says what's your opinion on
72:35 - typescript will it replace javascript in
72:37 - the next five years
72:39 - uh i don't think it will replace
72:40 - javascript like
72:43 - yeah i i mean i don't really know the
72:45 - numbers i haven't looked into it that
72:47 - much but i doubt that it will replace
72:49 - javascript
72:55 - charbelle says make a new timer yeah i
72:57 - could make a new timer somebody that
72:59 - used to watch the streams a lot his
73:00 - name's harshit um he made a uh a timer
73:04 - for me but i forgot the url so i just
73:07 - need to figure out what the url of it is
73:09 - and um and go to that timer that one
73:12 - always worked really well
73:16 - all right i'm gonna that was about five
73:19 - minutes of
73:20 - um
73:22 - chat so i'm gonna go back now because we
73:24 - we need to build now
73:26 - so the um
73:29 - i guess i should say like keeping the
73:31 - user logged in
73:32 - is not working exactly like we had it
73:34 - working before but it's
73:37 - it's still saving the id
73:40 - so
73:41 - i'm okay with that and then like i said
73:43 - if the user has some sort of password
73:44 - manager they could save their their
73:46 - other credentials in here and i think
73:48 - that would be okay
73:53 - maybe we could potentially give the user
73:55 - an option to stay completely logged in
73:57 - all the time on a future update
74:01 - but i don't want to make that the
74:02 - default
74:06 - so i'm going to leave it off for now
74:07 - plus i just really want to get this
74:09 - bundled up into the app store like i
74:11 - said we are having some error messages
74:13 - come up i shouldn't say air we're having
74:14 - some warnings come up
74:17 - which i'm okay with for now uh as
74:20 - because i don't think it'll crash our
74:22 - app
74:23 - i think we'll be we'll be all right so
74:24 - we're not having any crashes
74:26 - so um
74:28 - i think we're good to keep on on going
74:31 - let's do uh
74:35 - we're gonna have to save the changes
74:36 - that we just made
74:40 - we're gonna do an am flag for our commit
74:44 - and
74:46 - let's do
74:48 - fix because this was a bug um
74:54 - let's see
74:55 - take
75:03 - so
75:04 - i'm committing this and it says it's to
75:07 - take user back to login screen after
75:08 - logging out
75:10 - i'm going to push that
75:13 - if you want to see the code that i'm
75:14 - pushing
75:15 - then check out the github repo the links
75:17 - in the description
75:20 - all right let's go to
75:23 - i'm gonna
75:24 - shut down now our our expo server
75:28 - and close out
75:30 - i have a lot of windows here that are
75:32 - not necessary right now so
75:35 - i don't need this right now
75:38 - we did that
75:41 - um
75:45 - i don't think we need this
75:47 - and bundles
75:51 - i don't think we need this i'll keep it
75:53 - i must open it for a reason so i'm going
75:54 - to keep it up for now now we're going to
75:56 - do a build
75:57 - so let's run the expo build for android
76:04 - and then
76:05 - it looks like we're gonna have to answer
76:06 - some questions for this and let it run
76:09 - for a little bit and while it's running
76:10 - i can answer some more questions
76:12 - so we're gonna do expo build android
76:17 - and
76:19 - i guess we'll have to make a new expo
76:20 - account because i don't think i ever
76:22 - made one just crazy that i never made
76:23 - one because i've been using expo for
76:25 - years
76:26 - but i'm almost positive i do not have an
76:28 - account so let's make a new one
76:35 - it's cool that i don't have one because
76:36 - then we get to go over the whole process
76:37 - live
76:38 - username
76:40 - i'll just say j weigle
76:42 - and password
76:46 - i'm gonna make a password over here with
76:49 - lastpass so i can have lastpass generate
76:52 - secure passwords
77:04 - jay weigle already exists
77:06 - interesting
77:08 - let's see if i have an expo account
77:11 - uh
77:13 - expo dot io
77:15 - see if i can log in
77:17 - uh forgot
77:19 - password
77:20 - email
77:22 - jessie gmail.com
77:27 - all right i'm gonna open my email on
77:29 - another screen here
77:33 - evidently i do have an expo account
77:36 - well maybe i do maybe somebody just
77:40 - used the name jygo for an account
77:43 - well i do have a password
77:47 - so i'm going to reset my password here
77:49 - on this other screen
77:50 - and
77:52 - i'm going to use that new password that
77:54 - i just made
77:56 - and
77:56 - save password
78:00 - and i'm adding this account
78:02 - to
78:03 - lastpass so we'll have it
78:06 - cool
78:07 - let's log into my account
78:09 - [Music]
78:10 - suite i have no builds
78:16 - all right cool
78:18 - so let's try this now
78:21 - and let's pick the right answer log in
78:24 - with existing account
78:27 - uh
78:29 - jay weigl
78:31 - here's the password
78:35 - sweet
78:37 - let expo handle the process definitely
78:44 - build ios bundle i said android
78:49 - set expo debug true in your dev
78:51 - environment to view the stack chase what
78:53 - happened
78:55 - [Music]
79:04 - hmm maybe i hit the wrong
79:08 - did i hit the wrong thing
79:14 - oh okay once
79:16 - i thought it would just automatically
79:17 - pick that
79:18 - uh answer
79:21 - is one
79:21 - gonna work no it said false
79:24 - why did it say false all right what am i
79:26 - doing wrong here everybody
79:30 - let's make this bigger
79:36 - all right so it says
79:38 - let's try this again
79:40 - expo build android
79:45 - just there's a new version of expo cli
79:48 - available like we literally just
79:51 - installed this globally how did we get
79:53 - the older version
79:58 - all right let's do this let's get the
79:59 - new version first of all
80:03 - well let's try to npm install it this
80:05 - time how about that
80:08 - we used yarn before
80:10 - maybe
80:12 - maybe i had installed it with npm
80:14 - originally and for some reason it's
80:16 - using that one instead of the yarn one
80:19 - i mean you all saw me
80:21 - not that long ago install this so
80:26 - while that's going
80:27 - then we will
80:31 - let me double check
80:34 - so
80:35 - start the build
80:37 - expo build android right
81:00 - okay
81:01 - um
81:03 - wow this is taking
81:08 - well we'll see let me go to the chat
81:11 - i'll answer some questions and then if i
81:14 - get through all the questions and we're
81:15 - still not finished with this then we'll
81:17 - we'll handle that if it happens
81:28 - um
81:31 - we have a question that says
81:34 - can can you loop through an array of
81:35 - audio files hello from france hey how's
81:38 - it going
81:39 - um
81:40 - i'm assuming you can loop through an
81:42 - array of anything
81:45 - i'm not sure like how the audio files
81:48 - are
81:51 - like the format or anything like i don't
81:53 - have experience with that but if you
81:54 - have an array like i'm assuming you can
81:56 - loop through it
82:01 - um valentino says what's a brain
82:03 - computer
82:06 - jj says what's a computer this is the
82:09 - brain computer
82:11 - it
82:12 - reads your brain waves
82:14 - and then sends them wherever you want
82:15 - them to go like in terms of to an app or
82:18 - a website or something like that
82:21 - you can learn more about this i did a
82:23 - video review on my youtube channel the
82:24 - links in the description for my channel
82:26 - so you can check out to learn more it's
82:28 - called the notion and it's built by a
82:30 - company called nerosity
82:39 - wizock says react native was fun but
82:41 - flutter was better i haven't i haven't
82:43 - had a chance to use flutter yet i've
82:45 - heard good things about it um still
82:47 - using react native so um
82:50 - yeah can't really comment too much on
82:51 - that but
82:53 - um
82:54 - yeah i've
82:55 - what do you all think about flutter i
82:57 - don't want to start a battle between
82:58 - react david and flutter because i think
82:59 - they're both good
83:01 - um but what a if if any of y'all have
83:03 - used it you know what do you think
83:05 - uh tasha says what database are you
83:07 - using currently i have no database set
83:09 - up for this particular app uh so
83:12 - no no database um i don't know what th
83:15 - the neurosc device
83:17 - is has like its own um operating system
83:22 - and server and they they might have a
83:25 - database running on here and i don't
83:26 - know what it is but
83:28 - um
83:29 - in terms of like what we built for this
83:31 - app i don't have anything uh for a
83:34 - database
83:38 - arif says why why am i here
83:41 - uh obviously because you wanted to watch
83:43 - some code right or it was an accident in
83:46 - which case welcome and
83:48 - feel free to ask any questions if you
83:50 - have them
83:52 - uh lrj says i am human uh excellent so
83:56 - am i
84:01 - dl
84:02 - td says y'all so smart wish i can catch
84:04 - up oh don't worry about it we're not
84:08 - it's
84:08 - this is the fifth stream that we've done
84:11 - so like uh if if you if anybody can like
84:14 - jump right in and understand what's
84:15 - going on at this point then you have to
84:17 - be like very smart and experienced at
84:18 - this so um
84:20 - feel free to ask as many questions as
84:22 - you can
84:23 - or as you want to um
84:26 - and
84:27 - you know go back and you'll watch the
84:28 - previous streams definitely recommend
84:30 - watching them at double speed that'll
84:32 - help you to catch up
84:34 - and
84:35 - i i think the streams are easier to
84:37 - watch in double speed like i i talk kind
84:39 - of slowly i take my time so
84:42 - double speed is better
84:45 - [Music]
84:47 - uh pap stew says can you suggest to me
84:50 - some good channels or websites for
84:51 - android development i don't know too
84:54 - much about specifically android
84:55 - development uh he says using java or
84:58 - kotlin
85:00 - yeah i don't know for sure
85:02 - so um
85:04 - i know the free codecamp youtube channel
85:06 - that i'm on right now does have some
85:09 - videos about different types of
85:11 - development so we probably have
85:13 - something about java and kotlin so i'd
85:14 - check that out other than that though i
85:16 - don't really
85:17 - know too much about
85:20 - resources for that
85:27 - let's see
85:33 - a few people join saying hello so hey
85:35 - how's it going
85:40 - uh xx snooki says do you have any tips
85:44 - for people learning c sharp
85:47 - uh
85:48 - not really
85:50 - what is this telling me
85:53 - let's
86:00 - i'm gonna close this since we can't
86:01 - connect to the server anymore so
86:04 - there we go
86:13 - there we go
86:14 - closing
86:16 - closing a few things
86:17 - i thought it just occurred to me that
86:19 - hey if i close all this other stuff
86:20 - maybe this will install more quickly so
86:23 - actually it did so let's uh let's try to
86:25 - run
86:27 - let's try to run this again see if we're
86:30 - on the right version now and if that
86:32 - makes a difference
86:34 - right because if if we're using the
86:35 - latest instructions it's possible that
86:37 - because i was on an old version that's
86:39 - why it wasn't working i i don't know
86:41 - it's just a thought
86:44 - um
86:45 - i want to
86:47 - see
86:48 - answer so i'm trying to go up and down
86:51 - to see if i can
86:54 - change this like up and down but that's
86:56 - not working
86:57 - so i guess
87:00 - let expo handle the process
87:03 - let's see
87:08 - huh
87:13 - why is it doing this
87:16 - all right we're gonna we're gonna have
87:17 - to go into um
87:23 - go into research mode here for for a
87:25 - minute
87:26 - uh so let's see
87:32 - and one thing i don't understand is why
87:34 - it keeps trying to build the ios bundle
87:36 - when we're trying to just do android
87:43 - let's see what we can get
87:46 - alright cool
88:02 - okay
88:03 - looks like we need to start expo
88:06 - so let's run expo
88:14 - kind of odd i would have thought we
88:15 - didn't want it running when we do the
88:16 - build but i guess that is not the case
88:18 - so we want to and that this makes sense
88:21 - right if it's trying to connect
88:25 - then we definitely want it running
88:27 - alright cool so let's try it again
88:53 - i still
88:54 - i don't like that it automatically put
88:56 - in false for me here
89:06 - because i think i need the keystore
89:12 - so while this is doing its thing i want
89:14 - to look
89:15 - um
89:19 - look this up and see if anybody else is
89:21 - having issues with that
89:45 - hmm
90:02 - this up already
90:41 - all right well i guess
90:44 - when this is all over we'll try to grab
90:46 - our key store see if it exists otherwise
90:48 - we have to figure something out for our
90:50 - key store
90:51 - it seems like as long as we can
90:59 - when we have to upload
91:03 - otherwise feel free to upload your own
91:11 - that's weird
91:17 - oh well
91:19 - all right while that's happening
91:22 - let's let me go back to the chat
91:27 - [Music]
91:28 - all right the last question was uh do
91:30 - you have any tips for people learning c
91:31 - sharp
91:32 - um i don't really know i guess um
91:35 - just similar tips for learning anything
91:37 - try to do a little bit with it every day
91:39 - uh just keep on like try to try to build
91:42 - real projects with it
91:48 - one future says how can i improve redux
91:52 - skill example or project redux is hard
91:54 - i'm a junior front end deaf
91:56 - yeah i guess um for redux try to start
92:00 - out with something very simple because
92:01 - redux is difficult so try to start out
92:04 - with a simple project once you see it
92:06 - all working together on a project it
92:08 - gets a lot easier
92:10 - uh but you know i definitely
92:12 - try to find some sort of tutorial
92:14 - that'll give you a very simple project
92:16 - um you know you can check out like the
92:18 - redux documentation and go through that
92:20 - it's
92:21 - it redux is going to take a while for
92:23 - you to understand it's just kind of
92:25 - difficult at first
92:26 - so uh don't be discouraged if it's if
92:29 - it's taking a while
92:30 - like it's it is complex
92:37 - solo code ninja says hello brother hey
92:39 - how's it going
92:42 - xero says uh you can build ios apps on a
92:45 - pc no i don't think you can
92:47 - i think you could just build um android
92:50 - although expo might let you build like
92:56 - maybe expo like build it on their
92:58 - servers i'm not really sure how that'll
93:00 - work with with expo but i'm um
93:03 - i'm worried about building the
93:06 - android stuff right now i assumed i
93:09 - would have to switch to my my mac to do
93:11 - the ios stuff
93:19 - uh zanik says uh
93:21 - what up can you do html please i don't
93:24 - do much like straight html uh on on my
93:27 - live streams
93:29 - uh mostly i'm doing react native
93:31 - nowadays
93:33 - chinmay says uh how much did it cost oh
93:36 - the i assume you're talking about this
93:38 - spring computer interface i believe it
93:39 - was like a thousand dollars somewhere
93:41 - around there
93:42 - um this was like one of like the first
93:44 - test devices i don't know what the
93:46 - retail price is going to be once they
93:48 - they actually have them
93:50 - available
93:53 - like the finished product available
94:00 - chinmay says flutter is amazing still
94:01 - growing
94:02 - yeah that's what i thought too like i
94:04 - think flutter will be
94:06 - a legitimate like competitor to react
94:09 - native or i don't want to say competitor
94:11 - because
94:12 - that's like the wrong way to look at it
94:14 - i think it'll be
94:15 - a more legitimate option once the
94:18 - community grows
94:20 - right one thing i think react native has
94:23 - that flutter doesn't yet just because
94:25 - it's a lot older is a much bigger
94:27 - ecosystem more packages available
94:31 - and
94:32 - flutter will flutter will get there
94:34 - right as long as it keeps getting
94:36 - growing
94:37 - and more people using it it'll get there
94:39 - it's just it takes time
94:42 - so
94:43 - i think
94:44 - right now
94:45 - the flutter ecosystem is just
94:48 - it's just not quite as big right and i
94:51 - mean that comes with there's good and
94:53 - bad about that like if you want to get
94:54 - in and really have an impact on an
94:56 - ecosystem it's way easier to get in on
94:58 - an early ecosystem like flutter than it
95:01 - is on something like react native
95:02 - but if you just want to get in and build
95:04 - stuff
95:05 - the odds of you finding ready-made
95:08 - a you know examples and libraries to do
95:10 - what you want to do on a younger project
95:13 - are lower than on an older project so it
95:16 - just it really depends on what you want
95:17 - to do
95:21 - chinmace is waiting for webrtc on
95:23 - flutter good so like that's a good
95:24 - example it's just
95:27 - depending on what you want to do
95:29 - it may not be available for a younger
95:31 - project
95:32 - it's not to say it's a bad project it's
95:34 - just
95:35 - it's going to take time for people to
95:37 - start developing all the things that
95:39 - they need
95:43 - let's see
95:52 - let's see
95:56 - mr now now
95:58 - i'm not sure to pronounce your name
95:59 - apologies for that says uh what about
96:02 - algo should i have to learn it before
96:04 - studying programming
96:05 - you mean like algorithms
96:08 - no you definitely don't need to learn
96:09 - that before you start programming um you
96:12 - can start building stuff without that
96:15 - cmo says how to learn spring boots
96:18 - i don't know because i don't really know
96:20 - it a lot of people that i work with use
96:22 - it
96:23 - but i i don't know very much about it at
96:25 - all
96:26 - if anybody else knows more about it
96:28 - please let us know in the chat
96:31 - um
96:32 - mag mala says
96:34 - bruh i just learned drop down menus on
96:37 - html this is definitely out of my range
96:40 - oh
96:41 - well
96:42 - feel free to ask questions and watch if
96:45 - you want to i understand if it's if it's
96:47 - a little out of your range but uh
96:49 - congrats on learning drop down menus and
96:52 - uh that's that's definitely a good skill
96:54 - to have when building websites
96:56 - um but yeah i i really hope that these
96:59 - streams will be good for people at any
97:01 - skill level
97:03 - because i i do my best to explain what's
97:05 - happening
97:06 - and
97:08 - i do take any questions so
97:10 - uh i guess
97:12 - you don't don't try not to feel
97:13 - intimidated if you're just starting out
97:15 - and i'm happy to explain what's going
97:18 - on uh vivec says will you do any machine
97:21 - learning projects on the live stream
97:23 - i might
97:24 - i might we'll just see you know how this
97:26 - goes i think
97:27 - the data from the brain computer
97:29 - interface
97:30 - you could do some really cool machine
97:32 - learning stuff with that
97:33 - so i'm thinking like
97:35 - that's a possibility at some point and
97:38 - there's some other things that
97:40 - i think could be cool with machine
97:41 - learning that i'd like to do so i don't
97:43 - have any plans to do it in the immediate
97:45 - future but
97:47 - you know it is on my mind for some some
97:49 - projects that i've thought of
97:51 - uh brian says love from kenya love
97:53 - coding oh awesome thank you
98:02 - uh adrian says what react redux package
98:05 - is the best easy peasy
98:08 - um
98:10 - i'm not sure what you mean by react
98:12 - redux package
98:14 - if i i guess if i were to start out
98:16 - i would use create react app
98:19 - to uh to get started
98:21 - i believe there's now a react
98:25 - redux starter with create react app
98:27 - where it'll
98:28 - it'll scaffold out a react app with
98:31 - redux already kind of connected i
98:33 - haven't used it yet i just read about it
98:35 - so if i remember correctly i think that
98:38 - that is out there now that would
98:40 - probably be the best way to get started
98:41 - with reactant redux
98:50 - okay i can monitor the progress of the
98:52 - build at the url
98:56 - which i think i already have that open
98:57 - though right
98:59 - [Music]
99:01 - sweet
99:05 - build details
99:07 - building
99:09 - creating key store keystore created
99:11 - successfully key source and sources oh
99:13 - cool so evidently we did get the
99:15 - keystore created
99:17 - somehow although it was not obvious from
99:20 - here
99:21 - so
99:22 - let's let's check out some of the info
99:24 - we're getting from this so we're not
99:26 - really getting great info in the console
99:29 - which is cool they got this this thing
99:31 - here so
99:33 - um
99:35 - let's see so we got the keystore
99:36 - starting the build process
99:38 - icon setup
99:42 - native modules
99:46 - whoa
99:49 - whoa build is finished
99:50 - sweet
99:53 - nice build successful

100:06 - and it's uploaded now to
100:08 - s3
100:11 - very cool
100:14 - all right so let's let's go to the next
100:16 - step here
100:18 - um all right so we've built
100:21 - it's finished building
100:24 - let's test it
100:25 - to run it on your android device make
100:27 - sure you have android platform tools
100:28 - installed along with adb and then just
100:30 - run adb install
100:33 - with usb debugging all right i'm gonna
100:35 - plug my device in
100:38 - and then i'm gonna try to install this
100:40 - that we've just made
100:44 - on my android device
100:47 - and uh
100:50 - let's see
100:53 - i need to need to plug it in
100:56 - in the back of my
101:00 - computer so i i forgot to bring i was
101:03 - going to
101:03 - switch this up
101:07 - and have a
101:09 - usbc cable
101:10 - but i forgot to bring it
101:14 - so now i need to
101:15 - find my
101:17 - other cable that is usb on one end and
101:19 - usbc on the other end
101:24 - all right found it i need to unplug
101:26 - something
101:28 - that
101:29 - is in
101:34 - hopefully y'all heard what i was saying
101:36 - i was in front of the mic but
101:39 - okay
101:44 - all right
101:45 - plugging that in
101:49 - [Music]
101:51 - and
101:54 - and i do have a robe on it's cold in my
101:56 - basement so
101:58 - it's not it's not that professional but
101:59 - this is how i
102:01 - i like the streams to be authentic and
102:02 - this is how i often code so
102:05 - it is authentic
102:07 - all right so i have that plugged in now
102:09 - i need to
102:11 - run
102:12 - the
102:13 - adb install sweet so let me move
102:21 - let me get rid of that let's turn that
102:23 - off and i'm just going to go out
102:33 - downloads
102:35 - and let's see what we called it
102:39 - stay focused with all kinds of stuff so
102:42 - let's see
102:44 - adb install and then the file name so
102:46 - let's let's do that
103:00 - i'm pretty sure i had adb
103:03 - working
103:05 - adb
103:08 - huh
103:11 - i thought i ran an adb command not that
103:12 - long ago all right let's see
103:16 - how do i get adb to install the
103:21 - android platform tools
103:25 - let me open up my android studio
103:54 - tools
104:09 - all right let me let me do a little
104:11 - search here
104:14 - what was it called
104:16 - android platform tools
104:35 - she get the latest sdk platform tools
104:37 - for interest us sdk manager
104:48 - all right so android studio has an sdk
104:51 - manager let's see if we can
104:54 - and from the sdk manager
104:57 - we can get to tools
105:20 - see how this goes
105:36 - i should have gotten these
105:38 - when i downloaded
105:46 - i downloaded this so
105:52 - let me see if anybody
106:00 - oh barratt says maybe you installed adb
106:02 - for windows system but not for ubuntu
106:09 - yeah
106:11 - that's possible let's see
106:27 - oh sdk tools
106:46 - android sdk command line tools it said
106:48 - not installed so let's let's try to
106:51 - download this
107:14 - cool
107:16 - that's kind of odd
107:17 - i would think something like that like
107:19 - should have been the default
107:21 - but
107:22 - i guess not
107:28 - all right cool that was fast
107:31 - all right now let's see i might have to
107:34 - restart the terminal
107:38 - yeah or just start a new one let's see
107:41 - if i got
107:44 - see
107:56 - adb hmm
108:05 - try
108:05 - i doubt it would work in my linux
108:07 - subsystem
108:15 - hmm
108:23 - oops that was accident
108:27 - um
108:30 - maybe i'll just try to do it this way
108:35 - see if it works
108:57 - i thought i just did this
109:12 - oh it already exists
109:14 - why didn't it not
109:16 - write in an update
109:22 - that's sweet
109:29 - oh there we go
109:37 - now how do i install that
109:43 - uh cmo says add adb in variable
109:46 - environment
110:00 - um
110:27 - i wonder if i actually have access to
110:29 - any of the android tools
110:36 - that's very weird
110:46 - nothing
110:51 - man it says add to environment path
111:11 - let's see
111:22 - all right
111:23 - add adb
111:29 - all right let's see
111:41 - all right cool let's try this
111:48 - open windows explorer
111:52 - right click my pc
111:58 - properties
112:03 - advanced system settings
112:06 - environment variables
112:11 - we got
112:15 - path
112:17 - double click it
112:21 - okay
112:29 - browse
112:32 - whoops
112:39 - see program files adb fast
112:56 - oh
113:06 - hmm
113:50 - hmm
113:51 - i'm not seeing
113:54 - where to add this
114:06 - hmm
114:13 - oh man just copy the downloaded folder
114:15 - path and add us a new path
114:18 - oh that's right we did download that
114:48 - okay all right that'll add it to windows
115:02 - path oh okay i totally didn't see this
115:05 - first section
115:14 - that seems like the easier one
115:24 - but it looks like we don't have the exes
115:26 - we just have the dlls
115:29 - unless um
115:31 - oh actually
115:34 - fastboot adb application
115:38 - yeah we could copy that to
115:41 - c windows and it should be good to go
115:43 - from the command line
115:49 - actually let's do that
115:52 - let's just copy
115:54 - i'm going to copy those and then
116:00 - windows
116:02 - oops no no no cancel that
116:15 - all right so either way
116:16 - that should work at least for the
116:18 - windows part
116:19 - which is fine because i'll do
116:22 - a command prompt and let's see if we can
116:23 - do it now
116:25 - adb yes it works
116:31 - all right cool so we got a lot of stuff
116:33 - going on here okay
116:38 - oh goodness
116:42 - okay so
116:44 - back to
116:46 - where we need to go for
116:51 - there we go
116:56 - ah no i forget it's this actually let me
116:59 - look here
117:03 - cool i have adb here as well which is
117:05 - sweet so i'm already in the downloads
117:06 - here so let's just rerun this command
117:09 - that we just ran
117:12 - cool
117:13 - so this should perform an install
117:18 - on my phone
117:22 - success all right so how do i actually
117:24 - run this then
117:35 - hmm
118:01 - all right let's verify
118:08 - okay so i have a device
118:23 - oh
118:36 - hmm
118:50 - it says it's installed but i don't
118:52 - i didn't see anything happen
118:56 - on my phone
119:16 - interesting
119:19 - okay
119:22 - let's troubleshoot that then
119:32 - uh
120:06 - okay let's see
120:11 - madness says it's much easier to have a
120:13 - copy of the apk on your phone and then
120:15 - install it manually
120:17 - i could probably do it through uh google
120:19 - drive right
120:24 - you could upload the apk
120:34 - i'll do that
120:36 - on my other screen i'm just uploading
120:38 - the apk
121:01 - oh there we go it works
121:09 - it's in the process of uploading i guess
121:11 - i'll start it on my device in
121:17 - all right cool so it uploaded
121:19 - let's go to google drive
121:24 - i mean i would like to know why it's not
121:26 - working but you know just to get this
121:28 - started
121:29 - we can do the upload here
121:33 - let's see
121:35 - where's my google drive
121:52 - i'm gonna download this
121:56 - downloading it to my device now
122:10 - cool download worked
122:20 - all right
122:22 - i'm installing
122:32 - so we'll say as i'm installing this
122:34 - twice it opened just to give me like
122:36 - security warnings because this three
122:38 - times
122:39 - um
122:41 - it's it said there's security warnings
122:43 - here
122:44 - but it's opening so i don't know if you
122:46 - can see that
122:47 - it is open on my machine
122:50 - so um
122:52 - that's that's pretty cool let's uh
122:57 - i guess i
122:58 - can i'm going to try to run this on my
123:02 - device so i'm going to copy and paste my
123:05 - um
123:09 - my key or my like my device id
123:12 - into google keep so that i can easily
123:15 - copy and paste it into my phone
123:18 - and try it on my phone
123:20 - [Music]
123:27 - let's see
123:32 - cool google keep syncs very quickly
123:37 - it's really good for this kind of stuff
123:40 - all right i pasted that in let's put my
123:42 - email in
123:44 - and uh password i'll go into my lastpass
123:48 - and say
123:50 - nope i need
123:58 - um
124:03 - nerosity
124:09 - all right hopefully this is the right
124:10 - password
124:15 - nice
124:31 - all right cool so it's working
124:33 - so obviously i'm getting it's vibrating
124:35 - i know if you can hear that
124:38 - you can hear that on the mic now it's
124:40 - vibrating and uh i don't have the
124:42 - headset on so obviously like i'm not
124:44 - focused right and it's giving me this
124:46 - red this red message sweet i'm gonna log
124:49 - out now so it stops with all this
124:51 - vibrating
124:52 - oh no i logged out and it's still
124:54 - vibrating in red
124:56 - that's a bug
125:01 - but at least the vibrating only goes on
125:03 - for
125:04 - maybe like 10 seconds at the most maybe
125:07 - less than that
125:08 - uh but
125:10 - all right that's cool
125:16 - all right very cool
125:17 - so it works and uh
125:20 - i believe i have like a stay focused
125:23 - icon now in my phone which is really
125:26 - sweet
125:27 - see if i could find it
125:32 - yeah this so the little sf isn't an icon
125:34 - very cool
125:36 - all right so that works
125:38 - i'm going to
125:40 - go through the next step now of um
125:44 - let's get rid of this
125:46 - and
125:49 - submit it
125:50 - uploading apps
126:02 - so
126:04 - to upload the previously built
126:05 - standalone adapter apps where you simply
126:06 - run expo upload android
126:10 - uh but i thought we have to do
126:15 - we have to create an account download
126:17 - this json private key after that you
126:19 - have to create an app on google click
126:20 - console and upload your app manually at
126:21 - least once all right so we got to go to
126:23 - google play console
126:27 - which
126:28 - cool
126:33 - now i already signed up for an account
126:35 - on here so
126:38 - you would have to do that step let's
126:40 - create an app we're gonna call it stay
126:42 - focused
126:53 - short description
127:07 - alert you when you start to lose focus
127:10 - and the full description is
127:13 - works with the
127:17 - generosity
127:19 - motion
127:24 - q2
127:33 - there you go
127:40 - current level of focus
127:49 - [Music]
128:05 - nice vibrates all right cool
128:09 - all right
128:10 - graphic assets
128:21 - screenshots
128:24 - all right we gotta add at least one
128:26 - phone screenshot
128:27 - [Music]
128:29 - all right
128:30 - well
128:32 - i guess i'll uh take a screenshot from
128:34 - my phone then and
128:37 - download that
128:49 - all right all right i guess i'll upload
128:51 - the screenshot to
128:54 - um my google drive so that i can get it
128:57 - back down there
129:05 - [Music]
129:13 - all right i know it's been a while since
129:14 - i've gotten to the chat so i'll get back
129:16 - to the chat in just a minute
129:18 - let's try to get this screenshot
129:21 - uploaded
129:27 - all right so the screenshot's being
129:29 - uploaded to google drive i got my drive
129:31 - open on my other windows so i should be
129:33 - able to see when it gets there yep it's
129:35 - there
129:36 - now i'm going to download that
129:37 - screenshot
129:44 - and should be able to
129:49 - there we go
129:51 - uh oh need to resize your screenshot
129:59 - uh okay
130:01 - it's too big
130:05 - feature graphic
130:10 - goodness i need all this stuff
130:13 - to application
130:18 - productivity
130:21 - content rating
130:29 - man there's a lot of stuff to do this
130:32 - all right well let's just keep going
130:33 - then
130:35 - all right
130:36 - uh hi-rez icon let's see if we can use
130:39 - that uh icon that we created
130:47 - dimensions required are 5 12 by 5 12. uh
130:51 - okay
130:53 - so
130:55 - let's take
131:02 - pixlr
131:05 - [Music]
131:08 - all right so if i'm just resizing stuff
131:10 - i like to use pixlr
131:14 - i can figure out how to get logon pixlr
131:17 - editor
131:21 - which one is the
131:27 - i don't remember this is different than
131:29 - what i
131:31 - was looking for
131:32 - maybe
131:36 - open image
131:38 - let's open this one
131:41 - image
131:42 - image size
131:48 - there we go
132:11 - all right
132:12 - hopefully that'll work
132:24 - so this is probably boring
132:26 - i didn't realize uh
132:28 - how much was involved and now this one
132:30 - needs to be
132:32 - minimum length 320.
132:37 - interesting
132:38 - all right
132:39 - at least two screenshots are required
132:48 - oh we need at least two huh all right
132:52 - well i guess i'll take another one then
132:55 - let me do one logged out i guess there
132:58 - we go
133:02 - um
133:27 - okay
133:29 - so
133:30 - let's go into the editor then and uh
133:34 - let's get a new image
133:37 - and
133:41 - i'm gonna upload this image so we got
133:43 - this screenshot
133:49 - uh yeah we want a new size and it needs
133:52 - to be
133:53 - what was it three
134:01 - minimum length for any side 320
134:04 - max length for any size
134:06 - 3840
134:09 - so what do what do we have
134:18 - that seems like it fit though didn't it
134:25 - let's try that again because um
134:29 - it's between 320 pixels and 3840 pixels
134:35 - let's try that let's try that again
134:38 - see what it says you need to resize your
134:41 - screenshot
134:44 - max aspect ratio two to one maybe when
134:47 - maybe we're not hitting the aspect ratio
134:55 - let's see image size
135:04 - um
135:13 - let's see if we can
135:17 - google play
135:30 - uh let's see
135:36 - let's see if we got something that will
135:37 - do it for us app screenshot builder
135:40 - i don't want to create an account
135:49 - no no
135:57 - all right let's see
136:00 - uh harish says
136:02 - use bulk resize photos.com
136:05 - okay i'll try that
136:21 - actually what about this one
136:34 - cool
137:11 - see this is cool now what can i do with
137:13 - this
137:24 - if this worked that's going to be
137:27 - that's gonna be sweet

140:52 - all right let's save draft now i would
140:54 - hate to actually lose anything we've
140:56 - done here
140:57 - all right so so far i think we've got
140:59 - everything
141:01 - that we need up to here
141:03 - i guess we don't need tags
141:06 - content rating
141:08 - what are we gonna do here
141:12 - you must upload an apk before taking the
141:15 - content rating questionnaire okay
141:17 - that looks good that's good then
141:19 - so we'll skip that for now
141:22 - website i don't have a website please
141:24 - provide an email address
141:26 - there we go phone number hey now you all
141:29 - know my phone number
141:30 - um privacy policy
141:36 - if you wish pride policy policy please
141:38 - send it below
141:40 - um i don't have one right now hopefully
141:43 - that won't be an issue
141:48 - uh where can i go
141:53 - where can i upload this apk
141:59 - did i miss it
142:08 - hmm
142:43 - let's do a beta release i'm guessing a
142:45 - beta release would have less
142:49 - restrictions
143:10 - i don't know let me see
143:13 - for production
143:22 - all right let me go back i'm gonna go
143:24 - back to the chat before i do anything
143:26 - else just to see if anybody has anything
143:28 - like to say about this particular
143:30 - process right here
143:34 - let's see
143:53 - oh haru says you could use a policy
143:55 - generator and add the google doc link
143:58 - oh that's a great idea
144:02 - let's do that
144:21 - oh
144:34 - yes
144:42 - i don't have a company name
144:52 - no

147:48 - let's just put this in
147:55 - a google doc
148:08 - blank
148:29 - awesome that was a good idea
148:33 - let's let's go to the store listing and
148:36 - now we'll add in a privacy policy
148:41 - save that as a draft
148:42 - okay excellent
148:48 - now i need to
148:52 - i need to figure out i guess i gotta go
148:54 - to the app releases
148:58 - all right
149:01 - for internal testing within minutes
149:12 - i mean
149:13 - how
149:18 - i just wonder which one would be the
149:19 - best to do
149:21 - so did the google lock let me see let me
149:23 - go back to expo and see
149:29 - api access create a service account
149:31 - create new project
149:40 - all right
149:44 - let's do the api access and create a
149:46 - service account
150:02 - pretty i'm not sure if i was
150:04 - allowed
150:05 - to
150:08 - uh have this this looks like the public
150:11 - key
150:14 - so i guess it's fine that's in there
150:16 - um
150:28 - come here baby
150:30 - you want to say hello
150:36 - hey
150:38 - i'm building an app

150:48 - pretty cool
150:50 - how you doing today
150:51 - good good
150:53 - you say hi to everybody hi
150:58 - all right
151:03 - let's see daddy one of these
151:08 - what are these
151:11 - daddy what are these what are those
151:14 - that's a brain computer you want to wear
151:16 - it yeah
151:18 - it'll read your brain what do you think
151:22 - see you want to see it on the screen
151:23 - yeah
151:25 - all right
151:25 - look
151:34 - all right let's show you brainwash
151:38 - cool
151:38 - let's show this right now look this is
151:40 - uh cordelia my daughter is wearing the
151:42 - headset and this is these are her
151:44 - brainwaves
151:46 - well they were until i moved the screen
151:48 - let's start it again
151:51 - uh
151:52 - did something happen
151:58 - see if the signal quality is okay
152:10 - it's probably too big let me shorten it
152:12 - up for you baby
152:13 - okay there we go all right put your head
152:16 - put your head down there we go
152:19 - okay
152:21 - let's see if we get some better signals
152:23 - here
152:26 - your hair's a lot longer than mine too
152:30 - might be a problem
152:33 - hope it's almost out of batteries i left
152:35 - it on this whole time
152:37 - there you go we got some brainwaves oh
152:39 - we got a little bit
152:44 - got a little bit going on i don't know
152:46 - what the problem is
152:48 - how to refresh
152:53 - [Music]
152:56 - there we go
153:03 - that's crazy your brainwaves look pretty
153:05 - crazy huh
153:12 - what's your brain doing
153:15 - taking
153:16 - food from my
153:18 - belly you want to put this on crooked
153:20 - too i think
153:24 - there we go it's probably going to run
153:26 - out of batteries but that's kind of cool
153:28 - yeah i'll put this on the other screen
153:29 - and you can see
153:31 - you can keep looking at it how about
153:32 - that
153:34 - and they keep looking at your brain what
153:36 - it's doing making all those colors
153:40 - okay so
153:42 - anyway i followed a couple of links and
153:44 - got to this in terms of like the first
153:45 - thing so i guess there's two things to
153:47 - do one is create this account and then
153:50 - that way we don't have to keep manually
153:51 - uploading we can just use the expo
153:53 - command line to do it
153:58 - then we can
154:01 - then we can do the manual upload for the
154:03 - first time so
154:05 - let's do these steps
154:07 - and
154:09 - you know what's going to be crazy is
154:10 - after all of this
154:12 - we're still not going to have the app
154:14 - ready until they actually do the review
154:16 - so it'll take
154:18 - um
154:18 - a while
154:20 - before we get it actually in the uh in
154:23 - the app store i want to close out
154:26 - all these that we're not using now
154:29 - ah let's see
154:30 - [Music]
154:39 - okay
154:44 - okay
154:46 - all right let's see
154:50 - settings api access create service
154:52 - account let's just let's split the
154:54 - screen here so we can
154:57 - follow the instructions

160:48 - manager
160:51 - so
160:56 - role is release manager
160:59 - i guess i'm just going to keep the
161:00 - defaults
161:02 - and add a user
161:09 - all right cool
161:13 - now
161:14 - we can manually upload
161:17 - so let's go to
161:19 - the manual upload instructions
161:26 - so many instructions i definitely need
161:27 - to do this again like very quickly with
161:30 - like make another app because otherwise
161:32 - i will forget so much of this i do have
161:34 - some other apps that i never quite got
161:37 - finished maybe i'll try to finish them
161:38 - and do it
161:40 - what's the matter it won't turn on
161:42 - oh you know what because i i turned off
161:44 - the power strip because the fish tank
161:46 - was being really noisy
161:48 - why don't you go upstairs and play on
161:49 - the chromebook
161:52 - you want to see if you can play on the
161:53 - chromebook
161:55 - no you want to go tell the other kids
161:57 - that i'm i build an app
161:59 - for the phone

162:01 - no
162:04 - oops
162:07 - you want to play something
162:09 - go see if rafael will let you play the

162:12 - you'll see if he'll turn it on for you
162:14 - you play mario
162:19 - tell him i told you too
162:29 - all right let's see
162:32 - get your app ready for testing your
162:34 - productions
162:37 - all right so we did the create
162:38 - application
162:43 - take the content rating questionnaire
162:44 - and set up
162:46 - so i believe we created the store
162:48 - listing
162:51 - right so we did all that next steps take
162:53 - the content rating questionnaire
162:59 - so how do we do it
163:06 - all right sign it in place select an app
163:12 - all right let's go into our play console
163:14 - we'll move it over here
163:16 - select an app
163:19 - stay focused
163:20 - hey
163:22 - now on the left menu click store
163:24 - presence
163:26 - content content rating
163:31 - you must upload before taking questions
163:34 - all right well i guess we gotta upload
163:35 - then
163:41 - let's
163:43 - it's very odd to
163:45 - manage apk files
163:47 - [Music]
163:54 - all right well i guess let's let's do
163:56 - the releases then
163:58 - and uh
164:02 - production track
164:07 - you have released it hasn't been rolled
164:09 - out
164:32 - i which one is this the key that
164:36 - we created
164:47 - uh dimitri says you need to do
164:49 - everything that's more called the gray
164:50 - checkbox
165:07 - step requirement if you're using the
165:08 - recommended app publishing format to
165:10 - android bundle
165:12 - yeah i mean i think i'll go with that
165:14 - one then
165:22 - okay on the left hand side oh thank you
165:24 - dimitri so demetrius everything that has
165:25 - this little gray checkbox needs to be
165:27 - done before we can distribute the app
165:29 - thank you that's very helpful
165:32 - all right so let's accept that
165:38 - cool
165:41 - let's browse files
165:43 - and get this apk
166:03 - see what this is
166:22 - all right i wonder if this isn't gonna
166:23 - work because
166:25 - we have a different key we're not using
166:27 - that key
166:29 - we'll see
166:34 - um
166:36 - release notes this is
166:44 - initial release
167:22 - okay view warning message
167:35 - all right so we could use the android
167:38 - app bundle
167:43 - all right let's see
167:47 - which i thought we were we did read
167:49 - about that
167:51 - and
167:54 - i thought we were going to try to do
167:55 - that
168:28 - all right let's let's try this then
168:32 - maybe we didn't build the right one
168:45 - i think we need to start uh let's see
168:52 - whoops
168:53 - oh i forget
169:32 - all right cool
169:33 - let that run for a minute while we
169:36 - take care of some of the other stuff we
169:37 - need to
169:42 - there we go
169:44 - all right
169:45 - so let's get
169:46 - back to that let's see if we could do
169:47 - this yep cool
170:00 - okay
170:01 - app category
170:09 - no no no
170:11 - no
170:12 - no
170:14 - no
170:18 - no
170:31 - cool
170:34 - cool looks like a good rating
170:38 - nice
170:45 - all right let's get that one done
170:47 - have content
170:56 - well let me start that
171:06 - okay
171:07 - about this one
171:10 - it's free
171:11 - and
171:19 - no ads
171:44 - integrate my services with app actions
171:48 - i don't really know what that is
171:51 - do not prove my application
172:02 - all right that looks good
172:11 - okay
172:16 - all right cool eventually i do want to
172:18 - use this with android auto but
172:20 - it's not ready for that yet
172:27 - all right cool that saves let's go back
172:30 - to this cool
172:31 - target audience
172:33 - uh i guess it's not what are your target
172:36 - age groups 18 and older
172:39 - i mean
172:41 - let's just do 18 and older how about
172:43 - that
172:45 - no
172:50 - there we go all right cool
172:54 - and we got the release and
172:57 - expo
173:05 - whoa
173:20 - all right
173:22 - all right cool so looks like we got
173:24 - everything we need right now
173:26 - um this
173:28 - except this build
173:29 - this
173:30 - newer build
173:32 - um
173:35 - where's what part is it at running
173:36 - gradle
173:38 - all right so got through a bunch of
173:40 - steps
173:47 - so basically we got a
173:49 - warning
173:50 - on our
173:55 - on our release
173:59 - um
174:01 - saying that we could have done it
174:02 - basically better if we used a different
174:07 - a different apk so i thought like hey
174:09 - maybe we just
174:11 - do this but
174:13 - it's still building
174:15 - so
174:17 - i guess if the build doesn't succeed
174:21 - very soon i'm just gonna
174:23 - do this just to kind of try it out for
174:26 - our first try and i could always try to
174:28 - upload the other build later on
174:39 - so i think that's probably
174:43 - demetrius says going straight to
174:44 - production not the best idea
174:46 - yeah i wasn't really sure what the uh
174:51 - if i should try production first or not
174:53 - like
174:56 - the app is just uh
175:00 - very basic
175:04 - and there's not going to be a big
175:05 - audience because you need the nerosity
175:07 - device
175:08 - to use it
175:12 - i thought about doing a beta
175:16 - what do y'all think let's let's uh
175:18 - decide here so
175:19 - who thinks we should go straight to
175:21 - production or should we go to beta or
175:24 - even alpha
175:26 - um
175:28 - so basically the options are should we
175:30 - go to
175:30 - should we do beta
175:33 - okay so beta track is public i kind of
175:35 - do want it to be public for everybody
175:36 - that has a nerosity notion device to try
175:39 - it so the options are either
175:41 - beta or production at this point
175:47 - so let me know what you think
175:56 - and i'll check this
176:00 - this is still
176:01 - still working
176:06 - oh okay we've got some
176:11 - all right it's actually pretty close in
176:13 - terms of votes here uh between beta and
176:17 - production it looks like
176:20 - one for
176:23 - one for beta i'm assuming dimitri is
176:26 - leaning towards beta since he's the one
176:27 - that said production isn't a good idea
176:30 - so
176:32 - beta has one two three four votes
176:35 - production all right production only has
176:37 - two so um
176:39 - let's give it
176:43 - just another like few seconds
176:47 - we have a vote for gamma all right
176:50 - again
176:52 - uh harris says for this kind of app i
176:54 - would pick production nothing to risk at
176:56 - all
176:57 - i mean yeah that's i mean i kind of
176:58 - thought like
177:00 - nothing risk how about
177:05 - okay productions making a comeback now i
177:07 - think we're about
177:08 - about even
177:12 - i just wonder what let me
177:14 - i want to
177:16 - see what the difference would be
177:18 - because
177:19 - it seems to me that
177:25 - if everybody if it's still like
177:27 - available
177:31 - then
177:33 - i guess beta would be fine because i
177:34 - would like let the users know to like
177:36 - hey this is
177:38 - the very first like
177:41 - um
177:42 - oh dimitri says one difference between
177:44 - production and beta is an app store
177:45 - there's a text beta in the title
177:48 - yeah i
177:49 - i could see like
177:52 - it's true i don't want people to think
177:53 - this is a completely finished app so
177:55 - maybe beta is the right way to go
177:57 - because there are definitely more
177:58 - features i want to add we didn't really
178:00 - try to make it look amazing
178:02 - um yeah i think
178:08 - i think we can try beta so we definitely
178:09 - want to do open beta maximum number of
178:12 - testers
178:14 - if you set the maximum it needs to be at
178:16 - least a thousand uh
178:20 - all right that's i don't really care how
178:21 - many people use this i don't know how
178:23 - many i'll just put that in
178:25 - uh feedback
178:27 - i guess
178:48 - all right and let's edit release
178:53 - all right so that's enabled
178:56 - let's
178:58 - and
179:11 - i guess one
179:21 - all right so initial release one and
179:23 - then
179:25 - all right so that's still not hey it
179:27 - finished all right cool
179:29 - let's try this one then
179:50 - all right so we're going to try to
179:50 - upload the new one we'll see if this
179:53 - this goes well now technically we didn't
179:56 - test this one
179:57 - so
179:59 - this is definitely the beta
180:01 - all right
180:02 - yeah this is it
180:05 - and this is an aab not an apk so it's
180:08 - the
180:09 - i guess the newer
180:11 - version that's recommended
180:15 - so it's uploading pretty quickly
180:17 - should be ready soon it looks like we
180:19 - completed all the other steps
180:22 - so this might be the last step
180:27 - and this has been quite a long stream
180:29 - how long have we been going for
180:34 - i don't even know what's the time
180:53 - three hours
180:54 - yeah that sounds about right we started
180:56 - at noon yeah a three hour stream
180:59 - crazy
181:00 - i'm like super hungry and actually i was
181:03 - supposed to
181:07 - there's a like an online meetup for this
181:10 - neurocity notion device that
181:13 - i can't remember if it started at two or
181:15 - three
181:15 - either way i think i'm late for it at
181:17 - this point all right it starts at three
181:19 - so
181:20 - i'll be i'll be fashionably late
181:24 - processing
181:32 - uh-oh
181:34 - you need to use a different version code
181:36 - for your apk or your bundle because you
181:37 - already have a version of this code one
181:39 - oops
181:42 - um
181:47 - oh no wait a second different version
181:49 - code
181:51 - is that gonna does that mean
181:54 - if that means i have to rebuild it then
181:56 - i'm definitely not doing that
182:02 - uh where's the
182:03 - code at
182:05 - app json i'm afraid
182:08 - yeah version i i think we had to bump
182:10 - the version so i'm just gonna go back to
182:12 - the old the other one or i could remove
182:14 - it
182:17 - i say at this point i just used the
182:20 - one that we already uploaded that worked
182:24 - with the apk version code one
182:30 - and then because i don't want to go
182:31 - through rebuilding again that took like
182:33 - seven minutes to build that's i don't
182:36 - wait another seven minutes all right
182:38 - we'll try that one
182:42 - all right
182:50 - there we go
182:52 - and review
182:57 - [Music]
183:03 - all right which
183:05 - we know that that was the case so
183:15 - oh cool i can
183:19 - full roll out seconds ago
183:32 - okay dimitri says it's practically
183:34 - impossible to change the key with which
183:35 - you sign your app so be careful not to
183:37 - leak or lose it all right good um
183:42 - good tip thank you for that
183:46 - so do i need to create the release now
183:47 - or what
183:49 - set the next step
183:56 - all right we did that
184:03 - next steps
184:10 - publish your app
184:18 - i guess we do a release now
184:24 - no we just did one
184:26 - so did it did it actually release
184:30 - yeah i'm assuming that like release
184:33 - means it's it still needs to be reviewed
184:35 - and it's not actually available
184:45 - no production releases i understand that
184:52 - okay so we have beta
185:03 - cool
185:05 - so it's pending
185:07 - so they're reviewing the app so
185:08 - basically at this point i think
185:10 - everything we can do has been done
185:12 - uh the app review has to happen before
185:15 - it gets
185:17 - it gets launched so
185:19 - um this could take a while
185:23 - so i think
185:25 - there's other stuff that i want to do
185:27 - for the app
185:28 - i don't know if we'll hold off on that
185:30 - until
185:31 - we get here back from the release or
185:33 - we'll just keep working on it i'll i'll
185:36 - figure it out uh but
185:39 - yeah at this point i'd say we're gonna
185:42 - just gonna finish up the stream so um
