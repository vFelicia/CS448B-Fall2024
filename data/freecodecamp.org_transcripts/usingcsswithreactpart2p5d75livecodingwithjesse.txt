00:07 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:11 - and today we're going to do some css so
00:14 - our last stream which i think was
00:18 - friday thursday or friday of last week
00:21 - we started doing some css work so we're
00:23 - just gonna continue on with that
00:26 - uh since the other work that i've been
00:28 - doing lately is kind of boring
00:31 - and not really stream worthy so i'm
00:33 - saving
00:35 - some of the
00:37 - the work that might be a little bit more
00:39 - interesting and easier for beginners to
00:41 - follow along with
00:44 - so
00:46 - over the weekend i had a conference uh
00:50 - pittsburgh tech fest and i gave a talk
00:52 - there about
00:56 - basically a lot of stuff we've been
00:57 - doing over the last few months so using
00:59 - react and graphql to get data from
01:02 - wordpress
01:05 - uh so if you're interested in that talk
01:07 - check it out it's on my channel a link
01:09 - to my channel is in the description
01:12 - and it should be the last video that i
01:15 - that i did it should be right there
01:17 - on the
01:18 - home
01:24 - page i don't i can't see the live chat
01:27 - right now i'm trying to get that
01:29 - set up and then we'll start
01:39 - okay
01:41 - um also uh if you if you do follow me on
01:44 - twitter you may have seen this message
01:46 - earlier if you don't follow me on
01:48 - twitter and you'd like to uh link to my
01:51 - twitter is in the description as well
01:56 - but i have an idea for a project that i
01:58 - think will be pretty cool and i'll keep
02:00 - you all filled in on on how it's going
02:02 - but for now i'm just looking for advice
02:06 - so what i'd like to do is use some
02:08 - machine learning
02:10 - to
02:12 - predict whether or not a customer
02:15 - will convert whether they'll
02:18 - take the desired action
02:21 - based on some information they provide
02:23 - in an online form
02:25 - so i'd like to do it in javascript
02:27 - i've gotten
02:28 - i was thinking about using brain.js
02:31 - i saw some videos on it it seemed pretty
02:34 - easy to work with but i've also gotten
02:36 - some suggestions to use tensorflow.js
02:40 - so if anybody has any other suggestions
02:42 - or advice
02:44 - or any good resources for me
02:46 - let me know in the live chat or in the
02:48 - comments or wherever you'd like
02:51 - but i think that could be a pretty
02:52 - valuable
02:53 - uh tool
02:55 - for
02:56 - uh for businesses i know a lot of the
02:58 - bigger companies already have things
03:00 - like this they either pay us you know
03:02 - for an outside service to do it or they
03:04 - do it in house but i'm thinking this
03:06 - could be targeted more towards um like
03:09 - smaller businesses
03:11 - uh trying to make it
03:13 - you know somewhat user-friendly
03:17 - and
03:19 - you know the the big problem is for
03:20 - small businesses is just getting the
03:22 - amount of data needed to really make a
03:24 - good
03:25 - uh prediction with it
03:28 - but i do have some data that i'm
03:29 - thinking of working with
03:31 - that i think will be enough to get
03:32 - started so at least for testing you know
03:35 - for us
03:36 - i'll already have the data that i need
03:40 - um okay
03:42 - oh
03:43 - i forgot my my spotify i forgot my music
03:46 - uh the microphone finally started
03:48 - working
03:49 - on my mac
03:51 - at least i think it is it seems like
03:53 - y'all can hear me so
03:55 - now i can listen to spotify on my phone
03:59 - which definitely helps
04:02 - do most other people listen to music
04:04 - while you code let me know in the chat i
04:06 - just always assume that that's like a
04:08 - normal thing that people do but
04:10 - i've gotten so used to it now that
04:13 - it's just like constant
04:17 - and
04:18 - let's see
04:25 - okay
04:40 - all right so i'm just taking a glance
04:43 - here at the chat and then we're going to
04:44 - get started with this
04:46 - uh matthew asks about how about that new
04:48 - free code camp content yeah i haven't
04:51 - i've just looked at a little bit of it i
04:53 - haven't had a chance to try any of it
04:55 - yet i'm thinking about doing a series
04:58 - where i work my way through the new
05:00 - content maybe even do it live
05:04 - that would probably be on my own channel
05:08 - but if anybody would be interested in
05:10 - something like that let me know and then
05:11 - i'll i'll think more seriously about
05:14 - doing it
05:24 - oh wow michael said my live stream was
05:26 - thursday wow so it's been a while sorry
05:28 - about that
05:29 - um
05:31 - i don't remember why i didn't stream on
05:32 - friday to be honest but yesterday i had
05:35 - a doctor's appointment that was an hour
05:37 - away
05:38 - in the morning
05:40 - and uh the doctor's appointment took
05:41 - longer than i thought because i had to
05:42 - get blood taken and then i got back
05:45 - to work
05:46 - uh
05:48 - stopped at the store to get something to
05:51 - eat for lunch i got to my office ate
05:53 - lunch in my office and then had
05:56 - two meetings back to back and then a
05:58 - third smaller meeting that was
06:00 - no i was not expecting
06:04 - and then i had to
06:05 - watch the kids because my wife took my
06:07 - son to karate so it was a very busy day
06:10 - if i would have been able to fit a
06:12 - stream in it would have been really
06:13 - short
06:14 - um
06:15 - so as it was i ended up getting
06:18 - i needed to get paperwork done um
06:21 - that was due by the end of the day
06:22 - yesterday
06:24 - so anyway
06:26 - i don't like to have that long of a span
06:28 - between streams but
06:30 - it happened
06:44 - oh that's it michael thanks that's what
06:47 - i remember so i did do a stream on
06:49 - friday i just forgot about it but i did
06:51 - it on my channel so that was when we got
06:53 - ready for the uh for the talk that i did
06:56 - thank you
06:59 - just
07:01 - uh i don't know what's up with me
07:03 - i just the weekend was was rough it was
07:06 - so busy
07:08 - uh i needed like another weekend to
07:10 - recover from my weekend
07:12 - all right so let's let's get this
07:14 - started seems like i've been talking too
07:17 - much
07:19 - at the beginning here
07:20 - um
07:24 - okay
07:27 - i'm gonna switch scenes
07:29 - all right
07:32 - i'll make this a bit bigger for everyone
07:34 - [Music]
07:37 - i think that's that's probably good
07:40 - on size let me know if it's not
07:43 - not sure i could go much bigger than
07:45 - this and still kind of see what's going
07:47 - on
07:47 - uh for for the last hour or so i've been
07:50 - working on these these routes so i've
07:52 - been going into wordpress cleaning up
07:55 - data making sure the slugs are correct
07:58 - and uh actually just deleting a lot of
08:00 - posts that
08:01 - were either not needed or
08:04 - i could combine with other posts
08:07 - so the data came over very like
08:09 - fragmented and lots of different posts
08:11 - so i've been able to combine a lot and
08:13 - then also add routes
08:16 - so i've been running into this issue
08:17 - where
08:18 - uh there'll be two and sometimes
08:21 - completely different
08:22 - urls for the same content
08:25 - so i have
08:26 - modern languages
08:29 - and
08:30 - mod lang lit
08:32 - both go to the same content and not only
08:35 - that but then on top of that so if you
08:37 - go like
08:38 - franciscan.edu modern languages slash
08:42 - uh
08:43 - classes
08:44 - it should it takes you the same place as
08:46 - if you did
08:48 - mod lang lit slash classes
08:51 - so like this whole tree of pages
08:54 - has
08:55 - double urls
08:57 - and
08:59 - i'm not sure which one
09:01 - is even the
09:03 - the right one
09:06 - i believe that depending on what link
09:08 - you click on on the current site it
09:10 - would take you to one or the other and
09:12 - it doesn't redirect
09:15 - so it's a bit of a mess but i'm glad i
09:18 - found that
09:19 - so that i can add this in
09:21 - trying to avoid
09:23 - broken links as much as possible
09:28 - all right so that's what i've been
09:29 - working on so the last few commits
09:30 - you'll see in the repo uh are basically
09:34 - just that
09:36 - so
09:36 - not really that much to catch up on
09:38 - uh in terms of work on the github repo
09:43 - um
09:44 - what do you think
09:46 - yeah oh you can find the link to the
09:48 - github repo in the description
09:51 - uh also if anybody's been
09:55 - uh worried about microsoft and github or
09:57 - excited about it or anything let me know
10:00 - in the chat that might be cool to talk
10:01 - about i know there's not a lot of
10:03 - details available yet but
10:06 - uh i'm kind of interested to see what
10:08 - you all think
10:12 - i don't have any plans to move my repos
10:15 - yet
10:16 - um
10:18 - i at least for the for franciscan
10:21 - university's repos
10:23 - i know um
10:25 - you know we use a lot of microsoft stuff
10:27 - like office 365 so
10:30 - i don't really see an issue with leaving
10:32 - those repos on there in terms of my
10:34 - personal repos
10:36 - i'm not really worried about it
10:38 - until there
10:39 - some reason to be worried about it you
10:41 - know
10:44 - but i would like to hear what you all
10:45 - think
10:48 - all right so
10:50 - i just started a pomodoro uh timer
10:58 - oh nikki has a good point says does
11:01 - microsoft buying github mean the atom
11:03 - editor is doomed uh use visual studio
11:06 - code anyway but still
11:07 - that's a great point i did not even
11:09 - consider that yet
11:12 - uh
11:13 - but yeah uh
11:15 - you know because they're
11:16 - let's say like
11:17 - i thought about electron because github
11:20 - you know built and maintains electron
11:22 - but microsoft uses electron for for
11:25 - several products
11:27 - and actually
11:29 - that microsoft hosts an electron
11:30 - conference i i believe
11:33 - um or at least they sponsor it and they
11:36 - contribute to uh the project
11:39 - so
11:40 - i thought oh okay well that's actually
11:41 - not a bad deal
11:43 - but i didn't think about adam whereas
11:45 - you know visual studio code is direct
11:47 - competitor to adam
11:51 - i would i would hate to see adam go away
11:53 - i don't use it much anymore either but
11:55 - it's it's good to have options you know
12:10 - all right
12:12 - so this is the last page i was working
12:13 - on this made this is probably a good
12:16 - page for us to check out so
12:18 - uh if you're just joining us you didn't
12:20 - catch the last stream where we did css
12:22 - basically what we're going to do is just
12:24 - go through the site and find things that
12:27 - look
12:29 - like they need a little work so
12:31 - it doesn't have to be perfect
12:33 - but if it looks broken we are definitely
12:35 - fixing it
12:36 - so i'll just scroll through this page
12:38 - quickly
12:41 - uh right off the bat i i see some
12:43 - inconsistencies in spacing
12:47 - i i really don't like this long list but
12:49 - right now
12:53 - i i don't want to deal with that right
12:55 - now
13:01 - yeah
13:02 - all right there's nothing on the page
13:03 - that absolutely looks broken but you
13:05 - know what i i do remember something i
13:06 - noticed earlier
13:08 - uh so when we go to you know one of
13:11 - these
13:12 - and we go to click let's say on
13:15 - undergraduate we get a weird color
13:17 - i don't know if you caught that on the
13:19 - on the screen but uh it's almost like a
13:22 - pinkish color
13:24 - so
13:32 - i i want to change that i want to try to
13:34 - see if we can see it i'm going to zoom
13:36 - in and click to see if you all can see
13:39 - it as well
13:40 - uh if you want to check out the website
13:42 - you can go to
13:43 - dev.franciscan.university i'll put it in
13:45 - the
13:46 - live
13:47 - live chat in just a second
13:49 - okay do you see that that actually looks
13:51 - orange on on that screen
13:54 - uh
13:55 - depending on what screen where did this
13:57 - take me
13:58 - i think i accidentally clicked on
14:00 - something
14:01 - all right so let me do um
14:11 - all right so if you go to the link that
14:12 - i just put in the live chat you can
14:14 - browse through the site
14:16 - as well
14:20 - so
14:24 - i believe that we changed this at one
14:26 - point and i don't know if it reverted
14:28 - back or because we added some of these
14:31 - extra
14:33 - drop downs if that had anything to do
14:35 - with it
14:38 - but
14:40 - oh
14:42 - looks like that page does not work
14:46 - good to know i have a list of all the
14:47 - pages that don't work so
14:49 - i'm not i'm not worried about
14:51 - you know taking note of that right now
14:58 - ali ali a fanboy says
15:02 - ajax with a heart yeah this
15:04 - ate my ajax yolo shirt it's uh you only
15:08 - load once
15:09 - yeah
15:10 - so this is actually an eventbrite shirt
15:12 - so i got this uh at
15:15 - the first syntax con
15:18 - um from
15:21 - uh ben alegbedu who uh who works at
15:25 - eventbrite does a lot of conference
15:26 - talks
15:30 - if you don't follow ben on twitter you
15:32 - should he's a nice guy he's got a lot of
15:34 - good info uh i think his twitter handle
15:36 - is ben nvp
15:42 - all right so let's go into code and uh
15:45 - let's
15:47 - let's check out
15:50 - our theme
15:52 - and see if we can just fix it here
15:59 - let's see
16:02 - so
16:08 - i doubt it's a problem with our theme
16:10 - because
16:14 - it looks like the style works like if
16:16 - you could see that on
16:18 - other click events
16:20 - we we do have proper colors so
16:27 - yeah maybe we'll have to go right into
16:28 - the component
16:33 - actually you know where we should go
16:34 - let's go to the documentation
16:38 - that might save us a lot of a lot of
16:40 - searching
16:41 - um
16:43 - there we go
16:53 - let's look at
16:57 - i don't remember what that's called oh
16:59 - nikki says he uh
17:01 - says i know how to fix that give me a
17:02 - sec to look it up
17:09 - okay
17:11 - cool
17:12 - all right i'll give nikki a second
17:15 - to to let us know about that um
17:20 - ali also asked where are you from
17:22 - right now i'm streaming from ohio
17:26 - from steubenville ohio
17:28 - which is right on the
17:31 - eastern border
17:32 - so
17:34 - right next to where pennsylvania and
17:36 - west virginia meet
17:38 - so i'm pretty close to pittsburgh
17:40 - originally i am from west virginia
17:44 - and those are all of course in the
17:46 - united states
18:14 - okay
18:16 - let's see what
18:18 - this is
18:25 - button
18:28 - he had a a few people coming in saying
18:30 - hello hey everybody
18:32 - uh thanks for watching
18:44 - all right so the drawer
18:55 - all right so the side list
18:57 - we need to check the list components
18:59 - then
19:13 - because i believe what we've done is
19:14 - just we've nested lists
19:27 - oh if we actually if we just nested
19:29 - lists we may
19:30 - may be able to just see this easily
19:42 - okay
19:44 - so let's check our
19:48 - tour item.js
20:02 - okay so this is a hover color
20:10 - okay nikki saying find the css for that
20:13 - link and apply color inherits to it
20:16 - okay
20:17 - um let's see where
20:23 - back up and go to drawer
20:26 - let's see what we've done here
20:36 - um
20:55 - interesting all right let's go back in
21:00 - here sub item
21:03 - icon container
21:16 - that's odd i i don't actually see
21:18 - anything that would make the top links
21:21 - um
21:28 - change michael asked which page you
21:31 - working on i couldn't see when you
21:32 - started
21:33 - okay
21:35 - um
21:37 - this
21:38 - i'm not really on any page i'm just
21:39 - looking at uh this side
21:42 - side navigation
21:46 - all right sneaky so see the external
21:48 - link css class there okay
21:57 - was it on the back on this other one
22:03 - oh there we go external link color
22:05 - inherit that's the same thing okay
22:08 - all right cool thank you
22:10 - thank you nikki
22:20 - uh okay i see
22:22 - uh because we manually put in those
22:24 - external links down here didn't we
22:29 - yeah we did
22:31 - okay so we put that class right on the a
22:33 - tag
22:35 - all right that's that's uh super helpful
22:41 - all right so let's check our a tags here
22:43 - and see what classes so we do have a
22:45 - class as sub link
22:48 - on our a tags
22:51 - and
23:00 - i believe those are the only a tags we
23:03 - have
23:04 - just double checking
23:08 - okay
23:11 - so on our sub link
23:16 - let's try to put that in there
23:19 - and
23:20 - let's save that and then we'll try it
23:22 - out
23:33 - okay
23:39 - great
23:40 - and then let's try a sub link
23:44 - awesome
23:48 - let's make sure just try a couple more
23:50 - yeah
23:51 - awesome
23:52 - great job nikki
23:54 - um
23:55 - that's really cool that that was a very
23:57 - easy fix
24:02 - very easy fix so
24:05 - wonderful
24:09 - at one time we uh we actually had a
24:12 - issue open for that so let's check the
24:14 - issue and uh see if it's still open we
24:17 - can close it
24:23 - and i'm going to check on my timer
24:25 - all right so in about 11 minutes i'm
24:27 - going to come back to the chat and
24:29 - answer a few questions uh for a little
24:31 - while
24:33 - so
24:34 - let's see here we are
24:43 - issues
24:45 - oh wow i didn't realize
24:48 - i have three pull requests
24:50 - if you've submitted poor crafts recently
24:52 - uh sorry that i haven't checked them and
24:54 - pulled them
24:55 - uh merged them yet uh i'll um i'll try
24:58 - to get that done
25:00 - after the stream
25:03 - all right so
25:05 - the regex oh actually i got a pull
25:08 - request about this so i'm excited to to
25:10 - review that
25:15 - faculty titles not displaying oh
25:19 - i you know what i figured out how to fix
25:21 - that bug because i was having the same
25:23 - blood bug on my presentation slides
25:26 - um so i stayed up really late on friday
25:29 - and figured it out so this might be a
25:30 - good one to uh to fix soon
25:35 - before i forget how i did
25:54 - all right cool so we don't have an issue
25:56 - for that anymore
25:59 - um like i said i think someone it may i
26:01 - think it may even have been nikki
26:03 - actually fix that at first but then i
26:06 - broke it again once i added in that
26:08 - other stuff
26:09 - and then carry over the styles so we can
26:12 - go ahead and
26:14 - commit this change
26:18 - so we are using git as our version
26:21 - control for this project so we can check
26:23 - get status
26:25 - here in our terminal that's integrated
26:28 - right in here with visual studio code
26:30 - and we can see that we have made a
26:32 - change to that drawer item.js
26:34 - and
26:37 - we can do a git add
26:40 - all right to get that file ready
26:42 - uh and then we're gonna do yarn cm
26:44 - because we have a little custom script
26:46 - set up
26:48 - to help us make well-formatted commit
26:51 - messages
26:53 - um
26:54 - so it's a
26:56 - shoot
26:57 - oh well
26:58 - i guess it's not really a new feature uh
27:01 - it's a color change so i don't know if
27:02 - you want to say that's a feature or not
27:04 - so
27:11 - change on
27:13 - on click color
27:21 - of your sub items
27:23 - all right
27:27 - yeah i guess feature is an okay thing to
27:30 - do i mean it wasn't exactly a bug or
27:32 - anything
27:40 - oh michael said uh i've almost figured
27:42 - out the first issue but i'm not quite
27:44 - there yet
27:45 - my regex food is terrible
27:51 - yeah i thought let's let's check that
27:52 - out for just a second here
27:54 - uh that pull request
27:57 - because i thought one of these was about
27:59 - that
28:08 - all right let's let's check the file
28:10 - let's see what's going on
28:14 - all right so
28:18 - we now have
28:25 - okay cool so we have this regular
28:27 - expression here
28:29 - and then we're replacing all that with
28:32 - this
28:39 - interesting
28:50 - that's really i mean this this regular
28:52 - expression is is definitely beyond uh
28:55 - what i've ever done
28:57 - um
28:58 - so that's really awesome yeah so i'm
29:01 - gonna have to test that out
29:04 - it looks like
29:09 - there's a little way to test it here i
29:12 - know this is a little off topic of this
29:14 - today's stream
29:15 - um
29:17 - but since since we were talking about it
29:19 - i figured why not just test it out
29:24 - and uh we had to wait a second for this
29:26 - to go through anyway all right so that
29:27 - worked it passed all the tests
29:29 - and
29:30 - so let's push that
29:32 - up to github
29:44 - all right cool so it did match that
30:15 - uh
30:16 - okay interesting
30:18 - so
30:21 - well here's here's what i guess i'm
30:22 - assuming is is happening
30:24 - um
30:27 - this
30:29 - here this uh a dollar sign
30:32 - three
30:34 - must
30:36 - i i guess that's putting in the third
30:38 - capture group
30:39 - so with one two three the third capture
30:42 - group is what grabs the
30:44 - uh the url
30:47 - uh for this link
30:50 - so by by using this we're actually able
30:53 - to insert
30:54 - like a variable whatever is captured in
30:57 - there remember that was the issue that
31:01 - this was the issue that caused me to
31:02 - give up on using a regular expression
31:04 - because
31:06 - i had no idea how to do it
31:08 - but i did know how to do it uh in
31:10 - javascript
31:11 - so uh but this this is definitely the
31:14 - better solution so
31:16 - we'll probably go with that i'm not
31:18 - gonna merge this now
31:20 - um it's it's off topic for what we're
31:22 - doing right now but then also um
31:24 - any like
31:26 - stuff i do on the command line goes
31:28 - really slow when i'm trying to stream so
31:30 - uh let's go back to our
31:33 - our css
31:37 - so
31:38 - we've accomplished that
31:40 - and
31:43 - i'm gonna refresh because for some
31:44 - reason it's not
31:47 - it's not closing the drawer when i click
31:56 - okay michael creel says i thought we
31:57 - were only trying to replace the intext
32:00 - yes
32:05 - yeah that's what we were trying to do
32:07 - but
32:10 - i guess in a sense that's exactly what's
32:12 - happening again but it's it's
32:15 - the end result is the same
32:17 - okay so the end result is that
32:21 - all the markup stays the same except the
32:24 - inner text
32:30 - but the process to go about that is
32:34 - is a little bit different with that
32:36 - regular expression
32:37 - um
32:39 - so
32:41 - i said i
32:42 - i don't know that i would have come up
32:43 - with that
32:45 - but i like it
32:51 - which i mean i'm assuming that it all
32:52 - works uh it seems like it will so i'll
32:55 - just off to test it and then if
32:57 - everything does work i will
33:00 - merge that pull request later on
33:03 - all right so we already checked this
33:04 - page uh let's go through
33:07 - i want to try to find some pages that we
33:09 - haven't really seen before
33:16 - nikki said added the title prop to or is
33:19 - that already there accessibility for the
33:21 - win
33:22 - i don't remember if that was there or
33:23 - not but uh it should be there
33:25 - if it wasn't
33:29 - all right let me check uh
33:32 - i think we already checked some of these
33:34 - pages um
33:37 - so i'm not gonna do this top two
33:43 - all right we have nothing there right
33:45 - now
33:46 - we have to build that out
33:50 - employment in hr
33:54 - okay
33:56 - that's good yeah i kind of i think we
34:00 - i think we looked at this stuff already
34:02 - faculty openings i don't think this page
34:04 - works no it doesn't
34:24 - all right
34:26 - consumer information
34:30 - all right not bad
34:33 - yeah this page didn't turn out too bad
34:35 - at all
34:40 - let's see if any of these pages work
34:44 - uh so i'm just gonna open a bunch in
34:46 - some new windows assuming that they're
34:48 - interior pages
35:09 - all right
35:13 - nope that does not work
35:18 - whoa
35:22 - all right
35:24 - well
35:25 - it's not the worst thing ever
35:31 - but uh
35:34 - the way these are
35:36 - like this i guess is centered and this
35:39 - one is
35:40 - i wonder if these are just set to be
35:42 - like right on the end of this line
35:47 - of both these lines
35:52 - no no we may be able to work on these
35:54 - but my timer just went off so
35:57 - let's take a five minute break and do
35:59 - some uh question and answer
36:01 - i'm gonna scroll all the way to the top
36:03 - see if there's any questions um if you
36:05 - have any questions that you'd like for
36:07 - me to answer please put them in the chat
36:09 - now
36:27 - nikki says writing a blog post about
36:29 - using keyboard shortcuts to get things
36:32 - in code done faster what are your
36:34 - favorites
36:35 - ah interesting if anybody has any
36:37 - favorite
36:39 - keyboard shortcuts to get things done uh
36:42 - let let nikki know in the chat
36:45 - charlie what
36:48 - it's kind of hard to think about
36:51 - you know because you get used to him
36:52 - it's kind of thing like you just do it
36:53 - you don't
36:54 - at some point you just stop thinking
36:56 - about it as
36:58 - some trick you know
37:00 - um
37:02 - i don't know probably the thing i use
37:04 - the most that saves me time is multiple
37:06 - cursors so on a mac with visual studio
37:09 - code it's command d now i have the atom
37:11 - keyboard shortcuts enabled since i was
37:13 - used to using atom so i don't know what
37:16 - it is on visual studio code by default
37:19 - but you know command d to do the
37:20 - multiple cursor thing
37:22 - is uh really helpful
37:26 - and i don't know i mean aside from that
37:28 - all the normal ones right
37:30 - uh
37:31 - you know control f for for finding
37:34 - things i probably use that
37:38 - that might be what i use the most also
37:40 - of course copy and paste but everybody
37:42 - knows those ones
37:43 - um
37:45 - yeah if i think any other ones i'll let
37:46 - you know
37:56 - oh wow uh nikki does not listen to music
38:00 - while coding interesting
38:21 - michael says i heard that gitlab had a
38:22 - spike in activity in the last two days
38:24 - not sure if it was real
38:26 - um
38:30 - yeah i don't know i mean
38:33 - even before the announcement was like
38:35 - official you had people talking about
38:36 - going to uh to get lab
38:40 - i mean i
38:42 - i don't know i it reminds me a little
38:44 - bit it's definitely not the same
38:47 - situation but it reminds me a little bit
38:49 - of
38:51 - when everybody said they were going to
38:53 - leave facebook you know a month or two
38:55 - ago
38:56 - and
38:59 - like i i didn't leave facebook and
39:01 - obviously like a lot of people just
39:03 - didn't leave facebook but in in terms of
39:05 - like
39:06 - i don't know in terms of the people on
39:07 - twitter that i follow and on instagram
39:10 - you know there were some
39:12 - there was some like
39:13 - reaction strong reactions to it like i
39:16 - just deleted it you know
39:17 - um
39:19 - i think this is gonna end up being a
39:20 - similar thing like they're gonna be some
39:22 - really vocal people who are like i'm
39:24 - definitely moving uh but you're gonna
39:27 - see like the vast majority of
39:29 - people probably end up staying
39:32 - uh with github
39:34 - uh
39:35 - if if if not for any other reason than
39:37 - just it takes a while a lot more effort
39:40 - to move than to stand still right
39:42 - like there has to be a really good
39:44 - reason for people to move
39:47 - and
39:49 - i don't think they're
39:52 - i mean microsoft hasn't done anything
39:53 - yet there no decisions have been made
39:56 - there's uh so we just don't know what's
39:58 - going to happen
39:59 - if something drastic changes with github
40:02 - yeah then people more people might move
40:04 - but if it stays largely the same
40:07 - just the fact that microsoft owns it i
40:09 - don't think is going to be enough for
40:10 - anybody to move especially with
40:13 - i mean how many developers use visual
40:14 - studio code now
40:16 - right it's you know there are
40:19 - open source microsoft tools that are
40:21 - widely accepted by developers you know
40:24 - why couldn't github be that too
40:27 - right
40:28 - um
40:29 - i don't know so i think
40:31 - it could be awesome
40:34 - it could be like hey github's the same
40:36 - except better because now there are more
40:38 - resources behind it and that would be
40:40 - great
40:42 - uh or
40:43 - you know it could end up being bad it
40:45 - just depends on what's decided upon so
40:48 - it seems like
40:49 - at least for now at least till the end
40:51 - of the year
40:53 - things aren't going to change that much
40:56 - so i think they're going to take it kind
40:58 - of slow in the transition at least
40:59 - that's what i read
41:01 - so
41:04 - that's my opinion on it which
41:07 - what do i know so just take that for
41:09 - what it is
41:14 - uh
41:15 - tomiwa says
41:17 - i think they should just keep uh both
41:21 - running on separate teams i think that's
41:22 - where we we were talking about visual
41:24 - studio code and adam i think that's a
41:26 - good idea at least at first keep them
41:29 - both running uh on separate teams
41:32 - and
41:34 - you know just kind of see where it goes
41:35 - from there
41:38 - you know if
41:40 - i mean they're very similar applications
41:43 - they both run on electron they both do
41:45 - the same thing so
41:47 - i guess long term if it ends up being
41:49 - that the best of one just gets absorbed
41:52 - into the other
41:53 - that would make sense i don't know if it
41:55 - would be a good thing
41:58 - but it would make sense
41:59 - uh if it if it happens
42:10 - all right so my five minute timer is up
42:13 - i'm gonna reset my pomodoro timer
42:15 - after this 25 minute session is over i'm
42:18 - going to come back to the chat and
42:19 - answer whatever questions are still
42:21 - remaining
42:25 - all right so for this page
42:27 - i actually like really hate to work on
42:29 - this page because it's it's a standalone
42:31 - page styles i do for this aren't going
42:33 - to carry over into anything else
42:35 - so it's like
42:36 - we don't get that much for the amount of
42:38 - work that we're going to put into this
42:40 - so
42:42 - i think we're not gonna do it
42:44 - this is the page that we have to have
42:47 - uh
42:48 - for
42:49 - for our accreditation or membership in
42:52 - these organizations
42:53 - uh so we have to display this somewhere
42:56 - but nobody looks at this
42:58 - except for
43:00 - possibly the people that police
43:03 - organizations to make sure that they're
43:05 - displaying these things
43:06 - uh i'm not
43:08 - i'm not really a fan of these things
43:10 - they actually cost a lot of money
43:13 - just to be able to display this
43:15 - and
43:16 - so i don't know i've argued in the past
43:19 - that prospective students high school
43:21 - students
43:22 - don't care at all about these things
43:25 - uh and
43:27 - so it's a waste to have them but
43:31 - um
43:31 - [Music]
43:33 - that's not what what people think so
43:36 - what other people think in my
43:37 - organization so we're still going to
43:39 - continue to pay a lot of money for these
43:41 - and display them
43:42 - for the time being but
43:45 - my advice to just hide them somewhere
43:48 - um was taken mainly because
43:51 - those those little things that show up
43:53 - in there they load so many scripts those
43:56 - aren't just images
43:58 - so many scripts get loaded it was
44:00 - slowing down we had them on the main
44:01 - page it was slowing it down
44:02 - significantly and it's already slow
44:06 - so at least
44:07 - at least my idea to take him off the
44:09 - front page was uh accepted
44:21 - all right so
44:22 - this
44:32 - actually this is really interesting
44:37 - i'm just looking at the url path to
44:40 - these
44:41 - as you know we set up a
44:43 - google cloud storage bucket
44:45 - to store all kind of the images and the
44:47 - pdfs that are on the current site and i
44:49 - don't believe that i got that file
44:52 - because i i didn't think there was
44:53 - anything live on the site that was using
44:55 - this file this was this folder was
44:58 - supposed to be for the admin panel of
45:00 - the old cms
45:02 - so evidently some files got in there
45:10 - that's a really weird path
45:18 - you know what i don't i don't know if
45:20 - you all can see this or not but i don't
45:21 - think that's an actual path
45:32 - all right i'm gonna i'm not gonna work
45:34 - worry about that right now but that
45:35 - could be kind of a big issue if all the
45:37 - pdfs if if we're not given the real path
45:40 - and instead we're given the path to a
45:42 - dot aspx file
45:44 - that then pulls in that data given an id
45:48 - um that's going to be a problem
45:54 - oh same thing here
45:58 - yeah this is
46:00 - that's not good
46:12 - okay well at least i mean these pages uh
46:14 - in terms of how they look are acceptable
46:19 - yeah but the urls are
46:22 - for these pdfs or not
46:25 - uh the only thing i see that's really
46:26 - weird here is the spacing
46:29 - and i'm not sure why
46:32 - let's just check the code out for a
46:33 - second
46:41 - and
46:47 - why are there
46:48 - breaks between all of these
46:55 - that's insane okay
46:57 - um
47:00 - all right so it looks like whenever this
47:03 - came over
47:07 - wow
47:09 - i'm sorry this is too small for you all
47:11 - to see uh let me make this bigger so you
47:13 - can see what i'm looking at and just how
47:15 - insane this is
47:17 - um this is how the content came over
47:20 - when we uh pulled the content over from
47:22 - the main site with all these breaks in
47:25 - between
47:31 - that
47:34 - that's just
47:36 - all right so
47:39 - evidently yeah we have so we have
47:40 - already had these breaks set to display
47:42 - none which is good
47:44 - um
47:45 - but yeah i'm gonna leave this like this
47:47 - for now
47:51 - because once again this is one of those
47:53 - one-off pages that nobody really looks
47:54 - at anyway but we just have to have
47:58 - same way with this page
48:01 - you know
48:03 - it's all just legal
48:05 - stuff
48:13 - wow that's really small
48:15 - man i guess
48:21 - oh goodness yeah these are pdfs also
48:24 - i'm assuming they're pdfs i can't even
48:26 - tell really
48:27 - um
48:28 - but they they don't have real
48:31 - urls either
48:34 - okay
48:37 - pages all right
48:39 - and
48:42 - all right
48:43 - so all those pages were okay i'm glad i
48:45 - looked at them though because now i
48:47 - realize uh the issues that we have with
48:50 - um
48:52 - with those urls
48:55 - all right so let's check out the next
48:57 - set i really thought there would be more
48:59 - issues with styling to be honest
49:02 - i think we've gotten pretty lucky with
49:04 - some of these pages
49:06 - um
49:11 - let's check out this directions and
49:13 - attractions
49:15 - accommodations
49:21 - there we go
49:23 - that's an external link
49:27 - and
49:28 - so is that
49:31 - oops
49:38 - oh cool actually that's not bad even you
49:40 - know the way the image is set up now i
49:42 - definitely want to check this out though
49:44 - um
49:46 - on a smaller screen
49:50 - really it's what i should be looking at
49:52 - first okay
49:54 - that's not bad i was just i was worried
49:55 - that it would be aligned uh to the
49:59 - right instead of left but
50:01 - this i think may be taking advantage of
50:04 - some of those styles that we created
50:06 - um
50:08 - last week
50:10 - i'm gonna double check
50:17 - yep yeah those are our styles from
50:19 - before which is great so
50:22 - uh these styles are
50:24 - being applied elsewhere and they're
50:26 - doing what they're supposed to be doing
50:29 - all right
50:31 - cool
50:35 - and
50:36 - okay this is not too bad
50:38 - i'm not
50:41 - i'm not a fan of all this italics
50:45 - but
50:46 - uh like i said we are um
50:51 - we're looking for things that absolutely
50:53 - look broken
51:01 - oops
51:09 - all right let's try this page
51:20 - wow
51:21 - okay uh we are gonna work on this page
51:23 - because this page is gonna be important
51:26 - to
51:27 - uh the president of the university and
51:29 - some of the people that are higher up
51:30 - because they're really focusing on
51:33 - these things they call the the charisms
51:35 - of the university so
51:37 - we're going to work on this page even
51:39 - though it's you know it's basically one
51:40 - of those one-off pages that
51:43 - doesn't really get very much traffic
51:48 - but in this case the traffic that these
51:50 - pages do get
51:53 - is important
52:01 - all right so
52:04 - we can see we have h5s
52:08 - and h6s
52:11 - uh that h1 looks okay
52:15 - the h2s the size is okay
52:19 - but uh we'll see we may have to adjust
52:20 - the h1 and h2 depending on how big we go
52:23 - with
52:24 - uh our h5s and sixes
52:27 - uh so
52:29 - let's let's work with this h5 first
52:33 - and let's go
52:35 - let's go to the font
52:37 - size
52:38 - of let's try 18 just to start
52:42 - oh actually i think 18 looks okay and
52:46 - then
52:47 - font weight of
52:49 - 300 is gonna be
52:51 - thin
52:53 - let's try four see what it looks like
52:57 - four yeah i think four is more
52:59 - acceptable
53:02 - yeah four makes a lot of sense right
53:04 - there
53:16 - okay
53:19 - all right let's figure out what um
53:23 - style sheet we should use so what's this
53:25 - being used for department
53:28 - so for some reason the department style
53:30 - sheet is being applied here
53:34 - i get that the page is being applied
53:35 - here
53:37 - that's weird all right let's check let's
53:40 - check this out uh so we have about
53:43 - visions of charism
53:45 - uh let's go to our
53:49 - drawer menu.js and this should tell us
53:54 - what we're using to render this page
54:04 - you want another one of those
54:06 - where'd you get that one
54:10 - yeah i have another one come here you
54:12 - want to be on youtube
54:14 - i'm good at the other
54:15 - my oldest son is is here
54:18 - he's asking me for some of the stuff the
54:20 - the conference swag that i got
54:22 - you know what i think
54:25 - i have it down here i'll give it to you
54:27 - i'll give it to you a little bit here
54:30 - say hi you're right there down in the
54:32 - corner there this is raphael that's my
54:34 - oldest
54:37 - you want to say anything to people on
54:38 - youtube
54:39 - i don't know you don't know all right
54:42 - you want to hang out for a little bit
54:44 - okay
54:45 - so raphael here's what we're trying to
54:46 - do
54:47 - you see how on this page watch that cup
54:49 - and stuff in
54:50 - it let's put it over here
54:53 - um
54:54 - do you see how
54:56 - these
54:57 - are really small
54:59 - so we're trying to change that so
55:00 - they're not really small
55:02 - and so right now um
55:05 - we've we figured out some code to use to
55:07 - change it but we just need to figure out
55:08 - the right place to put it
55:10 - uh so we're gonna look here and what was
55:13 - the title of that page
55:14 - it's a vision charisms
55:17 - so
55:19 - actually we can just do a control fine
55:23 - division
55:26 - and charisms
55:30 - page type about pages
55:42 - about pages
55:45 - all right let me check
55:49 - our server
56:09 - see
56:24 - i know where i need to check um
56:28 - about
56:35 - i should have a route that is just for
56:38 - about
56:40 - and then we can see what it's
56:42 - what um component is automatically being
56:46 - rendered
56:52 - all right let me just scroll up because
56:54 - i think it's at the top
57:09 - maybe i don't have it
57:17 - check the bottom here
57:21 - all right let's uh
57:33 - yeah it should be rendering
57:36 - to page all right well let's just look
57:38 - at page i mean it's possible that
57:42 - i've
57:44 - i've loaded that css and page
57:51 - i did
57:52 - so for some reason in the page.js
57:57 - component i'm loading the department css
58:01 - uh style sheet as well
58:04 - i don't remember why i'm doing that so
58:06 - i'm gonna leave it there for now
58:09 - uh but maybe i'll go back and look at
58:11 - the uh get get history for this
58:14 - component
58:15 - and see when i did that and maybe it'll
58:18 - maybe then i'll remember why it's there
58:20 - if it's a mistake i'll take it out but
58:22 - for now let's put these styles in the
58:24 - page.css
58:28 - so we need to find our static folder
58:31 - let's close up some of these
58:38 - there we are static styles and then
58:41 - let's find that page dot css
58:45 - what do you think right there
58:50 - we think about this work
58:53 - that's a lot it's a lot
58:55 - a lot of stuff yeah did you do all of
58:57 - that
58:59 - yeah
59:00 - the people in the stream helped too
59:02 - all right so i'm just gonna put it down
59:04 - here at the bottom and we're gonna say
59:06 - h5 and i really hope that i copied those
59:09 - styles
59:10 - no i didn't okay uh i think it's easy to
59:13 - remember though i believe we went with a
59:15 - font
59:16 - uh size
59:20 - oops font size of 18 pixels
59:25 - and a font
59:29 - weight
59:34 - weights of 400.
59:43 - all right so let's save that and do a
59:45 - refresh
59:46 - see if it works
59:49 - yeah it worked
59:51 - okay cool
59:57 - now let's look at these h6s
60:00 - these are really tiny
60:04 - and but let's see what we can do
60:07 - so font size
60:09 - i'm gonna go start at 18 pixels and see
60:12 - how that looks
60:15 - actually that's that's not too bad but i
60:17 - only because it has that bold
60:20 - uh you know font weight
60:24 - let's see if we drop it down to like 400
60:27 - if it's still gonna look like
60:31 - actually that's that's not bad
60:33 - uh let me let me bump it up
60:36 - i'm trying to avoid making them so big
60:38 - that i have to adjust these uh larger
60:40 - headings but if we can go to 20
60:45 - actually i like that and then
60:48 - uh i want to see where all this padding
60:50 - is okay wow that's a lot of padding we
60:53 - definitely uh or i'm sorry margin we
60:56 - don't need that much margin um so i'm
60:58 - gonna leave the margin top for now and
61:01 - let's just go with margin bottom
61:04 - oops
61:07 - margin bottom uh let's let's try eight
61:10 - pixels oh yeah that's a lot better
61:16 - yeah that's so much better
61:18 - uh we're gonna go with eight i think i
61:20 - could go even further because it looks
61:21 - like
61:22 - i think there's some margin there on
61:24 - those p's yeah
61:26 - uh so let's go down further
61:33 - um
61:35 - can we go down there that low one
61:41 - okay
61:42 - uh we probably can just go to zero then
61:44 - margin bottom zero
61:52 - yeah i'm gonna go margin bottom zero
61:54 - since we have such a large margin that
61:56 - seems to be
61:59 - by default here
62:02 - yeah
62:03 - oh just in the user agent so
62:06 - yeah i'm gonna set a margin bottom zero
62:08 - on those i'm a little bit afraid that
62:13 - these styles are gonna mess things up on
62:15 - other pages though
62:18 - so we're gonna have to make sure as we
62:21 - click around that we
62:22 - we check
62:23 - uh but
62:25 - you know they definitely need to be
62:26 - bigger no matter what page they're on
62:28 - that font size was just unacceptable
62:32 - so
62:34 - i think this will be
62:37 - i think this will be okay that i mean
62:39 - that looks
62:40 - a lot better
62:43 - okay so let's move these over here
62:48 - throw in our h6
62:50 - and then
62:52 - put the styles in
62:55 - oops and
62:57 - i need to clean up
62:59 - i
63:00 - i need to get a plug-in
63:03 - or something that auto-formats my
63:06 - css
63:09 - that would be nice
63:11 - all right so that's in there let's do a
63:14 - refresh just to make sure
63:28 - yep great
63:33 - okay
63:36 - uh jeff miller says doesn't prettier do
63:38 - css
63:39 - yeah actually we are using prettier
63:41 - probably just need to set that up then
63:46 - nikki says shouldn't h6 be smaller than
63:48 - h5
63:49 - you are correct
63:51 - you're entirely correct and normally i
63:54 - would say yeah we're going to do that
63:56 - for sure but in this case the mark that
63:58 - we're given doesn't make sense
64:01 - so
64:03 - like this
64:05 - is not really a heading
64:07 - this is
64:11 - i i don't even know like
64:13 - maybe i would make this a block quote or
64:15 - something
64:16 - if i was gonna do it
64:18 - um
64:21 - yeah so this should not be an h5 it's
64:23 - it's not a heading
64:25 - um
64:26 - these are headings
64:29 - for each one of these little sections so
64:33 - or actually better yet if they're going
64:34 - to list charisms this
64:37 - should be like
64:38 - a dictionary style list i forget what
64:41 - the
64:42 - the html tags are so anyway
64:45 - there are better ways that would make
64:47 - more sense to set up this html so
64:50 - i entirely agree
64:53 - that the h6 should normally be smaller
64:55 - than an h5
64:57 - um
65:00 - but
65:02 - we're just doing what we have to do to
65:04 - make this look okay with the markup
65:06 - we're given
65:07 - and then we're going to go back like
65:08 - over the course of the next year
65:11 - i or someone else i can hire
65:14 - is going to go in here
65:16 - and make sense of all this markup
65:20 - and
65:21 - we won't have silly things like that
65:23 - happening you know eventually
65:32 - and actually since this is kind of like
65:34 - a one-off page we maybe could have gone
65:36 - in and actually adjusted this but i
65:38 - don't want to get into a habit of doing
65:40 - that because then the site will never
65:41 - launch
65:43 - um
65:44 - okay i'm gonna check my timer oh we only
65:46 - have about a minute left so i'm just
65:48 - gonna commit this change
65:51 - and then i'll uh i'll answer some
65:53 - questions and uh then we'll we'll wrap
65:55 - up the stream
66:01 - all right let's do a git status
66:03 - there we go that's that's what we want
66:05 - to see uh just that css files changed
66:09 - and we'll do a git
66:11 - add
66:13 - yarn cm
66:16 - and
66:19 - let's uh
66:21 - i guess we can do a fix for this that
66:23 - was obviously
66:31 - i i guess uh
66:32 - a ui bug right
66:34 - a design bug i don't know
66:37 - um so let's say uh fix
66:43 - heading
66:44 - um
66:48 - sizes and
66:58 - weights okay so that's going to do its
67:01 - thing
67:03 - and i can start answering questions now
67:05 - and as soon as that's done i'll just
67:07 - i'll push it up to the repo
67:09 - and um
67:11 - and then that way everything will be
67:13 - available to you all
67:34 - john hanson says you need it need a
67:36 - visual studio code extension for color
67:38 - highlight
67:40 - yeah you know what i had that on adam
67:41 - and it was pretty awesome that would be
67:43 - cool to have one on visual studio code
67:45 - but i'm kind of like
67:47 - i'm trying to not have um
67:51 - extensions that i don't need running
67:53 - because it does tend to slow things down
67:55 - and since i already have issues with
67:57 - trying to stream on on this laptop
68:00 - uh i probably won't do it here
68:02 - i have no problems adding in more stuff
68:04 - on my uh my imac at work though because
68:07 - it can handle it
68:14 - coding in caffeine says hi developers
68:16 - and coffee drinkers yeah i have uh
68:19 - my iced espresso here
68:25 - so i'm i'm with you today
68:27 - um
68:29 - rahul says when will this project be
68:31 - over
68:32 - i really hope we get this thing launched
68:34 - before july
68:36 - uh it
68:38 - based on my initial plans it would have
68:41 - been launched already
68:42 - um
68:44 - some things happened we were surpr i was
68:46 - surprised by the quality and amount of
68:48 - data to be honest with you and then i
68:50 - also had expected to be able to hire on
68:53 - some student workers and that just
68:54 - didn't happen
68:55 - so
68:58 - uh so it got extended out
69:00 - i mean if it ultimately helps
69:02 - you know make this a better
69:04 - you know better project a more smooth
69:06 - launch i guess it's okay but i i really
69:10 - i don't i start to get nervous when a
69:12 - project drags on you know i just want it
69:14 - to launch
69:16 - um
69:17 - i get what happens is like the longer
69:19 - you wait to develop a project uh it just
69:22 - makes you nervous become because it'll
69:24 - start to become outdated
69:26 - before it even launches right
69:28 - uh you don't want it to get so old
69:31 - that you have to at some point go back
69:32 - and completely redo the project
69:36 - but it but you don't want to launch
69:38 - something outdated so it's almost like
69:40 - you'd have to at some point
69:42 - also
69:44 - the project goes on and on people keep
69:45 - coming up with you know new ideas for
69:47 - things to do
69:49 - i don't like that i'd rather launch it
69:51 - and then any changes are going to be
69:53 - based on user feedback and analytics
69:55 - data and not just on well what if we did
69:58 - this or that
70:04 - all right so i'm pushing that up to
70:05 - github that will be ready in just a
70:07 - second
70:12 - uh coding and caffeine says love
70:14 - material by the way
70:18 - thank you
70:23 - nikki says all that pr for prettier
70:25 - eslant you can postpone i was just
70:27 - trying that out on a different project
70:30 - than the one i used as a sample for a
70:32 - blog post oh okay
70:35 - all right thanks
70:50 - uh john hanson says don't know if it
70:52 - would be a small change to give a hover
70:54 - to your anchor tags a darker color oh
70:56 - you know what i i we were talking about
70:58 - that last week weren't we um
71:01 - yeah i don't think it would be too
71:02 - difficult of a thing to change so that
71:04 - might be something uh
71:06 - that we do
71:08 - uh at some point
71:10 - i i think it would be good though
71:14 - the world's asked how do you get react
71:15 - into production mode
71:17 - um
71:18 - yeah so
71:20 - it depends on what you used to
71:22 - to to build it with so
71:25 - we use next so if we check out the
71:27 - package json it'll
71:29 - it'll tell basically we we just run this
71:31 - command and it does all the
71:34 - um
71:35 - transpiling and minifying concatenating
71:38 - everything uh so
71:41 - we just type in build
71:44 - right uh
71:46 - i think if it's if you use create react
71:48 - app it's also build
71:50 - um so of course it'd be yarn build or
71:53 - npm uh run build or something like that
71:58 - if you set it up from scratch then i
72:00 - guess you'd make the build command
72:02 - whatever you wanted it to be
72:13 - alright
72:31 - uh michael cruz said i had to do
72:33 - something and then i see jesse's mini me
72:35 - on the stream
72:41 - yeah he's off of school now so this is
72:43 - your first week off of school right yeah
72:46 - yeah
72:47 - what you been doing now that you don't
72:48 - have school
72:53 - i'm not coding right now anyway there we
72:56 - go you're playing outside and stuff yeah
72:58 - that's good
73:10 - uh
73:12 - gorov g-a-u-r-a-v i'm sorry if i'm
73:15 - messing up your name uh please let me
73:17 - know how to pronounce it if i am
73:19 - anyways this looks clean isn't it
73:22 - so i i guess you're saying the site
73:23 - looks clean uh if so uh thank you that's
73:26 - definitely uh what i was going for as a
73:29 - clean uh interface
73:34 - oh john hanson said nikki's blog is
73:38 - helpful nikki i'm going to check that
73:39 - out for sure
73:42 - i'm pretty sure you gave me the link to
73:43 - that before
73:45 - if you didn't give it to me and if you
73:48 - did is it cool if you give it to me
73:49 - again
73:51 - i'm gonna check the my twitter dms after
73:53 - this to see if you gave me the link
73:55 - already uh in twitter
73:58 - or i'll just check your twitter profile
74:00 - how about that
74:01 - and it's i i you probably have it linked
74:04 - from there so
74:06 - don't worry about it yeah but i
74:08 - definitely want to check it out though
74:11 - uh jeff miller says uh jesse i owe you a
74:14 - docker compose file for local minecraft
74:17 - server oh yeah yeah i mean don't don't
74:20 - worry about it i mean i don't i don't
74:21 - want you to
74:23 - you know take a bunch of time out of
74:24 - your schedule to do that but if you get
74:26 - a chance uh that would be really cool
74:28 - you hear that he's remember i told you
74:31 - someone from the live stream was gonna
74:32 - uh help and give us a file so we could
74:35 - create a minecraft server
74:38 - maybe maybe
74:40 - um so we'll create it and it'll run on
74:43 - like one of these computers
74:45 - so like we'll just at home we'll be able
74:47 - to play it
74:48 - cool yes it'll just be for us
74:52 - so then you don't have to worry about
74:53 - anything like any bad guys on the
74:55 - internet or anything yeah yeah
74:58 - it'll be cool we could uh
75:01 - we could build awesome things huh
75:06 - all right
75:08 - oh okay uh nikki's blog is uh nikki
75:12 - i pronounce your last name
75:14 - aha let me let me spell it out anyway
75:16 - because if if you can see the string now
75:20 - obviously you could copy and paste that
75:21 - if you're listening you'll probably need
75:23 - me to spell it anyway so it's
75:24 - n-i-c-k-y-m-e-u-l-e-m-a-n
75:30 - dot
75:31 - netlify.com
75:34 - blog
75:39 - yeah so i'm gonna copy and paste that
75:41 - into my browser right now so i don't
75:43 - forget
75:56 - okay
75:57 - um
76:00 - michael says since all the questions on
76:02 - your stream talks were about graphql if
76:06 - you get good at explaining it you'd have
76:07 - a niche you could dominate
76:11 - yeah i guess so um i did get talks about
76:14 - graphql i think i um
76:16 - i think i could have done better talk if
76:18 - i would have
76:22 - if i would have explained more about
76:23 - react and graphql and how they work at
76:26 - first because it seemed like the the
76:28 - people in the audience
76:32 - some of them i had never even used react
76:34 - before and a lot of them had never used
76:36 - graphql before
76:38 - so
76:39 - so the kind of the rest of the talk was
76:42 - a little hard to follow because
76:44 - i had assumed in order to get through
76:47 - all of the material on time i had to
76:50 - assume that the audience would have
76:52 - already set up certain things on their
76:54 - own
76:55 - so
76:58 - i don't know maybe i i could have uh
77:00 - kind of front loaded to talk a little
77:02 - bit more with some explanations so i
77:04 - mean really that
77:06 - i actually have taken that same content
77:09 - and uh i want to present it as a like a
77:12 - three to five hour workshop
77:15 - and really go through and actually build
77:17 - out a whole like demo project with
77:20 - everyone
77:21 - so that that i think would really be a
77:24 - better
77:25 - a better fit
77:27 - uh but still at least i think
77:30 - the audience members got ideas for
77:32 - what's possible
77:33 - so they'll definitely have to learn more
77:35 - about react and graphql if they want to
77:37 - do it on their own
77:40 - but
77:41 - but perhaps now they they see that
77:44 - something is possible and not that
77:46 - difficult to do that maybe they didn't
77:48 - even realize was was a thing before
77:53 - and that's i think that's valuable
77:59 - oh okay jeff says uh for what it's worth
78:02 - i use this docker image and
78:04 - uh has
78:06 - linked up okay cool i'll have to look up
78:07 - that docker image um so actu i have
78:10 - docker
78:12 - which i think
78:14 - i'm probably gonna run this on one of my
78:16 - windows machines i think i have docker
78:18 - running on one of them
78:21 - or installed but it's been quite a long
78:23 - time since i've developed anything so i
78:25 - have to probably do some updates
78:28 - um but
78:30 - i could probably test it on this mac
78:31 - though
78:33 - all right well i've gotten to the end of
78:34 - the live chat
78:35 - and
78:37 - uh i think this was a cool stream uh
78:39 - just you know basic css stuff but
