00:02 - all right in this video we are going to
00:03 - talk about the sources tab so I'm going
00:06 - to command option I which is my favorite
00:08 - way to open up Dev tools and it's
00:10 - already on sources here so the sources
00:13 - tab is pretty interesting it from the
00:16 - sound of it it's where you go to look at
00:18 - each of the sources you can look at each
00:20 - of the public documents that the page
00:22 - has loaded and that's true but when
00:23 - you're going to use it is when you're
00:25 - really trying to debug something the
00:27 - bigger your program gets the harder it
00:29 - is to find what's broken if something
00:31 - stops working that can be a huge time
00:34 - sucker but the sources tab is an awesome
00:36 - tool for helping with just
00:39 - that so what we're going to do here is
00:41 - we can set something called Break points
00:43 - looks like there's already some set up I
00:45 - was messing around on here a little bit
00:46 - earlier so I'll say um I want line 18 I
00:49 - just clicked it over here and now it's
00:51 - over here when I refresh the
00:54 - page it's going to stop at each of these
00:58 - places it says it's paus
01:00 - and when that happens I can go to any of
01:02 - these other tabs and see exactly what's
01:05 - going on that's a big deal because it
01:08 - allows you to really go step by step in
01:10 - your code and look at the big picture at
01:13 - a very specific moment in your codes
01:17 - run you can set your breakpoints based
01:19 - on a JavaScript event excuse me based on
01:22 - a specific line of code based on
01:25 - something to do with the Dom and
01:26 - manipulating n which we'll get to in
01:28 - other videos it is a really versatile
01:30 - tool and what I want you to remember
01:32 - about the sources tab is it is really
01:34 - helpful in debugging your code
