00:00 - after selecting a dom element you can
00:02 - set and get the css styles of that
00:05 - element so here's the html here and the
00:08 - html is being rendered down here and you
00:12 - can see that we have an id of line for
00:15 - this paragraph tag and we have an id of
00:18 - attribute here for this paragraph tag
00:21 - here we have an inline style
00:24 - making this bold
00:25 - and if you look up this at the css we've
00:28 - also added this css here so we've
00:30 - created the body
00:32 - and made the font size 30 pixels i'm
00:35 - just going to close this css here you
00:37 - can see for the javascript we've already
00:40 - selected two things so in the line
00:43 - variable we've got element by id line
00:46 - that's this first one the first
00:48 - paragraph tag then we get element by id
00:50 - attribute that's the the second
00:53 - paragraph tag here
00:54 - so i want to change the css style of the
00:58 - line
00:59 - so look we have line dot style dot color
01:03 - so line refers to this variable right
01:06 - here that get element by id line then
01:08 - you put style because we're changing the
01:10 - style and then we want to change the
01:13 - color
01:13 - style and we're going to set that to red
01:16 - so if i run that you'll see now we have
01:19 - red text
01:21 - you can also change this to background
01:25 - and we're going to make the background
01:26 - red
01:27 - there are a lot of different words you
01:29 - can put here to change the different css
01:32 - style elements
01:34 - if you check the link in the description
01:36 - you can see a list of all the css style
01:38 - elements that you can change
01:40 - now here's another example we're going
01:42 - to set the attribute let's get element
01:46 - by the attribute here
01:48 - the style and the box shadow we're going
01:50 - to set this to this box shadow
01:53 - and now we have a box shadow down here
01:55 - so here we're just setting one style
01:57 - property at a time
01:58 - but there are two ways that you can set
02:00 - a lot of style properties at once
02:04 - and we're using
02:05 - line.style.css
02:08 - and then you can see i've put in
02:11 - multiple styles
02:12 - color blue
02:14 - and then you separate with a semicolon
02:16 - border and adding a border here
02:19 - or you can set the attribute of style
02:23 - you set attribute now notice we don't
02:26 - have the word style anymore it's just
02:28 - attribute dot
02:30 - set attribute and we're attributes just
02:33 - a name from up here but you always have
02:35 - to use this set attribute and set the
02:37 - attribute of style and then you can put
02:40 - multiple styles that you want to set
02:42 - here one thing about this though that
02:45 - you need to know is that once we've run
02:49 - this you can see that we have the styles
02:51 - here this line is no longer bold we have
02:56 - an inline style up here
02:58 - to make this line bold
03:00 - but when you set all the styles at once
03:04 - with either css text or set attribute
03:07 - it's going to remove any inline styles
03:10 - and just replace all of the inline
03:12 - styles with whatever you are setting
03:15 - here
03:15 - sometimes it can be better just to set
03:17 - one style at a time if you don't want to
03:19 - get rid of the other styles that already
03:21 - exist now let me show you two ways you
03:24 - can figure out what styles are already
03:28 - on an element okay i've opened up the
03:30 - log here and i'm going to put
03:34 - okay console.log line.style so up here
03:39 - we were setting
03:41 - line.style.background to equal red and
03:43 - now we're just going to console.log
03:44 - console.logline.style
03:47 - now if i put
03:48 - line.style.background it will just show
03:51 - what the background color is but if i do
03:54 - line.style and don't put dot background
03:56 - it's going to show every style element
03:59 - so let me run that i can show you that
04:01 - and if i expand this this is another way
04:04 - of seeing every style element that you
04:06 - can set with javascript and this is
04:08 - going to show a list of every style
04:10 - element and you can see we have border
04:12 - left here this is set
04:14 - border color is black a lot of things
04:16 - though are not set you can see a lot of
04:18 - these just have an empty string we don't
04:21 - have anything set for most of these but
04:22 - we do have the color
04:24 - as blue
04:25 - one thing that you'll notice here if i
04:28 - go back to the css over in the code and
04:31 - we see we have font size 30 pixels
04:34 - well let's look at the font size in here
04:38 - font size is showing as an empty string
04:41 - here that is because when you are
04:44 - logging the style or working with this
04:47 - style here it's only going to show the
04:50 - inline styles and remember this up here
04:54 - is
04:54 - adding an inline style
04:57 - this will not show any other styles that
04:59 - just happen to be on the element for
05:02 - instance it's not going to show this
05:03 - style because it's not an inline style
05:06 - it just happens to also apply to that
05:08 - element now there is a way to get all
05:11 - the styles even styles that are not in
05:14 - line on the element and that's with get
05:17 - computed style so let me show you that
05:23 - now this is a little different i'm not
05:26 - calling it on the line variable that i
05:28 - set up here i'm actually calling it on
05:30 - the window object window dot get
05:33 - computed style and then i have to pass
05:36 - in
05:37 - the dom element i have to pass in this
05:39 - line variable that we created up here to
05:42 - get the computed style on the line
05:44 - and now it's going to show
05:48 - everything even computed styles so as an
05:51 - example if we go down to
05:54 - yeah font size font size is 30 pixels
05:58 - and now none of these are showing empty
06:01 - strings because everything is something
06:03 - we even have a height of 36 pixels
06:06 - now we never set the height of 36 pixels
06:09 - that's just the actual height so
06:11 - everything like before when we
06:13 - console.log just style a lot of them
06:17 - would be empty strings because they were
06:18 - never specifically set but when we use
06:21 - get computed style it's going to show
06:24 - what the style is even if you never said
06:26 - it
06:27 - well thanks for watching check the
