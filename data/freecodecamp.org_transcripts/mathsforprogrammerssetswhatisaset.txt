00:00 - Hello world! Shawn Grooms here again with Free Code Camp and in this video I'll be
00:04 - explaining what sets are. A set is a
collection of distinct objects called
00:09 - elements or members. An element is
essentially anything you want it to be
00:13 - and for example elements could be
numbers, letters, variables, more sets, or
00:19 - nothing at all. Sets are usually denoted
by capital letters such as capital A
00:25 - capital B, C, E, or F and we say that the
set contains elements. For example, we
00:33 - could say that the set A equals the set
containing the element 5 or we can say
00:38 - that 5 is an element of A. Now, I will be
inttoducing a lot of symbols like this
00:43 - this just means is an element of and
it'll save us a lot of time in future
00:48 - videos and I don't have to write out is
an element of each time so that will
00:53 - come in handy. So, what does the set
actually look like?
00:57 - Well, there are two common types of
  for sets and the one
01:01 - I'm interested in this video is roster
notation and it looks like this: it's just
01:04 - curly braces with elements inside
separated by commas, which is very
01:09 - similar to JavaScript - the only
difference being that in math we use
01:13 - curly braces and in JavaScript we use a
square bracket. So, now let's just walk
01:22 - through these. So, the set A
equals the set containing the element 5
01:27 - - that's how you would read this. The set B
equals the set containing the elements 2, 3,
01:32 - and 4. The set C equals the set
containing elements d, f, and g. Now, d, f, and g, they're
01:40 - not - they don't have to be variables.
They're either variables or they could
01:44 - be characters - it just depends on the
context. The set E contains no
01:49 - elements in this case which has an
impact that you'll see in future videos.
01:53 - Finally, the set F equals the set
containing elements A, B and C. In this case,
02:00 - our elements are sets so we would read
this as F equals the set containing the
02:07 - set containing the element 5, the set
containing elements 2, 3, and 4,
02:12 - and the set containing d, f, and g. So, in the next video i'll be going over a
02:18 - different form of set notation in
addition to introducing you to some
02:23 - common sets and this will set us up
02:25 - eventually my goal is to bring us up to
being able to define and understand
02:31 - algorithms and this is where we have to
begin.
