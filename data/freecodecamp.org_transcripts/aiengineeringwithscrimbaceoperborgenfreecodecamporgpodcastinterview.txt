00:00 - [Music]
00:15 - I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of
00:17 - freeo Camp each week we're talking to
00:20 - developers entrepreneurs and ambitious
00:24 - people who are getting into Tech and
00:26 - today we are thrilled to welcome PA
00:30 - borgan great to be here yeah and and uh
00:34 - we are so excited to have you here of
00:36 - course per is the founder of scrimba he
00:39 - is a software engineer turned Tech
00:42 - founder uh who's gone through like y
00:44 - combinator runs a very popular website
00:47 - uh that teaches coding we published many
00:50 - of those courses on the free code Camp
00:53 - YouTube channel and I'm just thrilled to
00:56 - sit down and talk with you because we've
00:57 - never had you on the on the podcast yet
00:59 - after more than 100 episodes so it feels
01:03 - like a bit of an
01:05 - Omission yeah also just note that I'm
01:07 - recovering from like a pretty serious
01:09 - cough that had me like completely
01:11 - debilitated for like a week so if I have
01:13 - a coughing fit or anything uh just know
01:14 - that I'm fine I'm just Echoes of my
01:17 - previous Illness but um per where where
01:21 - you are are are you over in Oslo right
01:24 - now yes we are based uh here out of Oslo
01:28 - where the founding team is from and and
01:30 - where yeah we all live awesome well I'm
01:33 - very interested as an American uh in you
01:37 - know I'm I'm from Scandinavia originally
01:39 - my family came over from Sweden which I
01:41 - know is different from Norway but uh I'm
01:44 - I'm always very interested in in that
01:45 - kind of region you know the land of
01:47 - Vikings and uh I know that Norway is a
01:50 - very small country but it's a it's a
01:52 - very influential country on the world
01:54 - stage and it has a ton of natural beauty
01:57 - so I have to ask what was it like
01:59 - growing up in
02:01 - Norway so uh I'm from the capital uh
02:04 - Oslo uh from the city so to be honest I
02:08 - don't I I I never really went to the the
02:11 - most beautiful places uh until I was uh
02:14 - an adult or not not not much at least
02:18 - but uh of course it's it's a great place
02:21 - to live uh good uh good good system uh
02:25 - welfare system but but with freedom as
02:28 - well and with uh skiing and nature and
02:33 - yeah great place you should you should
02:35 - come and visit us awesome it's
02:38 - definitely on my bucket list of places
02:40 - to visit uh so how would you compare
02:42 - like the Norwegian Tech scene uh with
02:45 - San Francisco in Silicon Valley where I
02:46 - know you've spent quite a bit of time
02:48 - over these past few
02:49 - years yeah so it's um much smaller of
02:52 - course and it's it's quite um it's less
02:57 - ambitious I would say or at least when I
02:59 - started out uh as a founder and like 10
03:02 - years ago or so uh there was a lot fewer
03:05 - startups and every time we I've gone to
03:07 - San Francisco have been been coming back
03:10 - super pumped and and twice as ambitious
03:13 - uh which is a sometimes a good thing
03:14 - other other uh at other times it's uh
03:17 - you want to be a bit more frugal and
03:19 - care about the fundamentals and and the
03:22 - next step and not the big dream so um I
03:25 - think we've kind of with scrim bot tried
03:26 - to struck a balance between being
03:28 - inspired a little bit by the the
03:30 - American ambition and and also by by the
03:33 - like uh down toe
03:35 - uh way of running companies in Norway
03:38 - but it is changing it it's becoming more
03:40 - and more uh International startups out
03:43 - of scan or out of Norway Sweden has had
03:46 - many over the last decades but but
03:48 - Norway's been lagging a little bit
03:50 - behind but it it's it's getting better
03:52 - yeah yeah well Norway of course is like
03:55 - an economic Powerhouse like per capita
03:57 - GDP I think is maybe the highest in the
03:59 - world
04:00 - uh and a lot of that is because you all
04:02 - have all this abundant mineral wealth
04:06 - did uh did you hear about like the
04:08 - discovery of the massive phosphate
04:10 - reserves and some of these other Rare
04:11 - Earth minerals uh I think it was maybe
04:14 - off the coast so so I have this thing
04:17 - right now where I actually don't read
04:19 - the news it's kind of my my New Year's
04:20 - commitment where I try to stay away from
04:22 - the news because it just kills my
04:24 - productivity so I've heard a little bit
04:27 - about it but to be honest you probably
04:29 - know more about it than I do okay cool
04:32 - well that that's interesting so you
04:33 - completely cut the news out of your
04:35 - day-to-day is that like a New Year's
04:37 - resolution yes that what I meant yeah
04:39 - resolution that's the word it is uh so
04:42 - because I just find that it's such a
04:44 - struggle to to stay productive with all
04:46 - the The Temptations out there H and and
04:49 - news and social media being the like the
04:51 - most important ones got to got to kind
04:54 - of make some rules for myself in order
04:56 - to stay away from it yeah I can
04:58 - definitely relate to that uh like I have
05:01 - kind of like tuned out a lot of the
05:04 - election related news here in the United
05:06 - States cuz I already know how I'm voting
05:08 - so it's not going to change anything so
05:10 - uh why spend a whole lot of time like
05:13 - going over the the Gory details of the
05:15 - you know Democratic process um I I
05:18 - realize that that may sound like a very
05:19 - privileged take but um I've got a lot of
05:22 - stuff to do and I can't be following the
05:24 - every uh the every unfolding of all
05:27 - these different uh you know drama that
05:30 - are that are going on I can just read
05:31 - about it in Wikipedia few years from now
05:34 - and figure out what the conclusion was
05:36 - without having to go along for the
05:37 - entire ride so yeah or like watch the
05:39 - evening news or something if a couple of
05:41 - times a week that's more that's what
05:42 - people did back in the good old days or
05:45 - good old it did like 20 years ago and
05:49 - that worked totally F pre social media
05:52 - days yes yeah so I'm very interested in
05:57 - delving into your background because you
05:58 - have a pretty unique background uh among
06:02 - Tech Founders and developers so you
06:05 - actually studied economics in college
06:09 - but then you went and you worked as a
06:11 - software developer for like five years
06:13 - maybe you can talk about how you got
06:15 - into coding and how you were able to get
06:18 - those those first few jobs as a
06:19 - developer maybe you can just kind of
06:21 - give us like an origin story if you will
06:24 - yeah so so I didn't work as a software
06:26 - developer for five years actually it was
06:29 - short than that it was like uh between
06:32 - one and two years after I I graduated
06:34 - from the boot camp and then um I've been
06:36 - coding at scrimba for like the last
06:38 - seven years here and there of course but
06:40 - but now now you go to a boot camp then
06:43 - yeah or it was a free peerto Paar driven
06:46 - boot camp in London so it was like no
06:48 - teachers and just a bunch of people
06:50 - thrown together uh who who um got a task
06:54 - every week like this week you're going
06:56 - to build a blog or an e-commerce site or
06:58 - whatever and it was our responsibility
07:00 - to learn from each other and help each
07:02 - other and kind of uh together build that
07:05 - that Weekly product it's called s like
07:08 - cool kind of what was it Founders and
07:11 - coders yeah I've heard Founders and
07:12 - coders yeah yeah and and that always
07:14 - like struck me because it's it's free
07:15 - and it's it's kind of peer-to-peer based
07:18 - it's very different from the
07:19 - conventional coding boot camp models
07:21 - that we had like in San Francisco for
07:23 - example um exactly so you hung out there
07:26 - with a bunch of other ambitious people
07:28 - who were trying to learn coding and
07:31 - essentially you kind of like selftaught
07:34 - in tandem yeah um I did that and that
07:38 - was kind of coming off the back of uh
07:40 - running a startup that failed uh with
07:42 - with the same co-founder that I started
07:44 - scrimba with a bit later but we we we
07:47 - tried to build like kids apps uh on
07:49 - iPhone and iPad and and books and old
07:51 - fairy tales and stuff like that we we
07:54 - did kids entertainment essentially um
07:57 - that failed um and I felt really almost
08:01 - at the time almost a bit stupid for not
08:03 - knowing how to code I felt like what am
08:06 - I doing in this tech industry and
08:08 - working with products if I really don't
08:10 - know how to like build uh anything or
08:14 - debug anything or fix anything so I just
08:17 - had a a strong urge to to learn to code
08:21 - H and that's so then I went uh to
08:24 - Founders and coders was fantastic and
08:26 - got a job at a startup when I came back
08:28 - to Oslo
08:30 - uh and worked there for uh a little over
08:32 - a year and then cindra and I kind of uh
08:35 - got the band back together and and and
08:37 - did another um startup attempt which
08:40 - just went uh went better yeah absolutely
08:44 - well that that's a really cool so it
08:46 - kind of like your your um I guess
08:48 - imposter syndrome as a Founder who
08:50 - couldn't code compelled you to like show
08:53 - that up so that you can code and of
08:55 - course now you code all the time and
08:57 - you've built out this skill set this
08:58 - developer mindset and actual kind of
09:01 - Hands-On understanding of implementation
09:04 - details of apps to the point that you
09:06 - even taught courses and things like that
09:08 - so uh yeah that's really cool maybe you
09:10 - can talk about your co-founder a little
09:12 - bit like how did you how did you two
09:13 - meet yeah so we met at um coworking
09:17 - space in Oslo when the the startup scene
09:20 - in Oslo was very small so it was a kind
09:22 - of the almost the only co-working space
09:25 - for Founders in OSA at the time and he
09:28 - was um he was working on his own project
09:31 - I was working with the kids books and we
09:33 - kind of realized that his skill set and
09:35 - um our and the business uh we me and we
09:39 - had a third Co co-founder that we had
09:41 - built at the time was very like
09:43 - complimentary so we kind of got together
09:46 - and and started that company and what's
09:50 - interesting is that he's he's a
09:52 - brilliant engineer like the best
09:54 - engineer I've worked with and he
09:57 - actually after uh the first company
10:00 - failed he went off and um worked on his
10:04 - own self-made programming language and
10:06 - started Consulting with his own
10:09 - self-made programming language which is
10:11 - like a terrible idea for the people he
10:13 - consults for because he was the only
10:15 - person who knew how to to write code in
10:17 - that
10:18 - language so he he then needed to um
10:22 - create documentation for that uh and
10:25 - started realizing that writing
10:27 - documentation is really boring so he
10:29 - started recording videos to teach people
10:31 - about this language which is called
10:34 - imba uh but just realizing or just
10:37 - trying to record videos he realized what
10:39 - a bad process it is for both the
10:41 - teachers and the students to record uh
10:44 - coding tutorials because as a teacher
10:47 - you have to like be really careful about
10:49 - setting up your system correctly about
10:52 - editing the video about making sure
10:54 - everything is polished about not talking
10:56 - yourself into a corner and there's tons
10:58 - of like
10:59 - uh adjacent skills that you need in
11:01 - addition to being like good at
11:03 - explaining
11:04 - things and uh once you've done all of
11:07 - that and spent like an hour creating
11:09 - like 10 minutes of of of a polish
11:11 - tutorial it ends up as a video which
11:13 - isn't interactive for the student either
11:16 - so it's it's kind of taken all the data
11:17 - and reduced it to dead pixels all the
11:20 - metadata so it's a bad experience for
11:22 - the student and for the teacher and
11:24 - that's what what made him like hm maybe
11:27 - we can make a coding tutorial in like
11:29 - video based coding tutorials in a better
11:31 - way and kind of rethink it from first
11:34 - principles and he did that and kind of
11:36 - invented the prototype for for scrimba
11:38 - which eventually then became yeah the
11:40 - company we are today yeah yeah and I I
11:42 - remember very early days like that I was
11:44 - just floored by this technology because
11:46 - it I mean at a fundamental level it
11:48 - wasn't anything
11:50 - technologically uh you know fancy it was
11:52 - just like what you said revisiting video
11:56 - from first principles and saying like
11:57 - hey why don't we you know sync up like
12:00 - this HTML with this audio essentially
12:04 - exactly and and for anybody out there
12:06 - who hasn't used scrimba you should go to
12:08 - scrimba and use it and just get a feel
12:10 - for how you press play sound starts
12:12 - playing you know slides can pop up and
12:14 - you can pause it at any point and and
12:16 - the actual Dom is being manipulated so
12:18 - that the code in the code edor editor is
12:21 - editable and you can just click play and
12:24 - it'll just keep going but you can pause
12:27 - it at any moment it it
12:29 - code is like unique in this perspective
12:31 - that like you couldn't do this if you
12:33 - were like having like uh maybe you could
12:35 - do it with like a video game system like
12:37 - where you like sync the video up uh like
12:39 - like speed demo archive like the old
12:41 - Quake demos they were literally
12:43 - coordinate data for where the person was
12:45 - like bunny hopping over and shoot rocket
12:47 - jumping and stuff and you could kind of
12:49 - pause it and you could you could like
12:50 - look around and stuff that's basically
12:52 - like what you did for coding in the
12:54 - sense that coding is just text and it's
12:58 - it's not that heavy and you can just
13:00 - render it in the Dom where it lives
13:02 - JavaScript is like the language of the
13:04 - web right so it's just like a web native
13:07 - I almost consider scrimba more of a dis
13:10 - a discovery than an invention in the
13:13 - sense that nobody thought to do it that
13:15 - way yeah but that's like cindra uh my
13:18 - co-founder he's he's the kind of guy who
13:20 - who really when he sees something broken
13:23 - he just like gets an urge to fix it and
13:25 - and then turn or rebuild it uh based on
13:29 - first principles and I think something
13:31 - you said there which is like the uh the
13:33 - weight of it h is key because a scrim is
13:37 - essentially just some tiny very very uh
13:40 - optimized pieces of data uh that uh kind
13:44 - of describe the changes that are
13:46 - happening in the Dom and makes it feel
13:48 - and look like a video H so so so kind of
13:51 - the bandwidth you need to watch a scrim
13:53 - compared to a video is like two orders
13:55 - of magnitude less which is part of the
13:57 - reason we've seen great success like all
14:00 - over the world in areas especially where
14:02 - the the internet internet access is slow
14:05 - yeah yeah because I I remember that was
14:07 - one of the big selling points of
14:09 - scrimber early on is like it's like 1%
14:11 - of a YouTube video in terms of bandwidth
14:14 - consumption and a lot of that is because
14:16 - video you're you're being very uh I
14:20 - guess uh imperative in the sense that
14:24 - you're telling every pixel what it's
14:25 - supposed to look like and yes there's
14:27 - like a compression algorithm and stuff
14:28 - like that but for the most part you're
14:31 - literally tracking like billions of
14:33 - pieces of data for like a short video
14:35 - right yeah um so it's inherently data
14:39 - intensive whereas yeah audio is a tiny
14:43 - fraction you know especially if you're
14:44 - using like uh like I think we use 96
14:47 - kilobytes for our podcast for example 96
14:50 - kilobit per second or something like
14:52 - that that's tiny that's like uh half a
14:55 - megabyte per minute uh video I mean
14:59 - once you add you and me on the screen
15:01 - and stuff it's probably like closer to I
15:05 - don't know 10
15:06 - megabits per 10 megabytes per minute or
15:09 - something like that at least uh it just
15:12 - dramatically changes it so that was one
15:14 - of the huge killer uh I guess
15:18 - applications for scrimber early on was a
15:21 - lot of folks don't live
15:23 - in San Francisco where they have gigabit
15:26 - internet and it's trivial for them to
15:28 - like watch 4K video on YouTube or
15:31 - whatever right A lot of people are you
15:35 - know putting money onto a phone card on
15:37 - like a data plan so they can you know be
15:39 - able to text and and maybe read some
15:41 - textual articles like Wikipedia or
15:43 - something and make some phone calls and
15:45 - stuff and scrimba is something that is
15:48 - kind of within their budget like even if
15:50 - you are on one of those kinds of plans
15:53 - where where you're paying and and the
15:55 - data prices in some parts of the world
15:57 - are exorbitant but that's it is what
15:59 - they it is what it is right like you
16:01 - have to kind of adapt to that and so
16:03 - scrimba has represented like this huge
16:05 - windfall for people who don't have a lot
16:07 - of data yeah and and just as a final
16:11 - thing uh which we haven't actually
16:12 - leaned into but also which is very uh
16:15 - real is the the the computational power
16:19 - and the and the um the electricity that
16:21 - is used like the the carbon footprint
16:24 - essentially of um serving a scrim and
16:27 - sending it over the network
16:29 - is also a lot less I mean I would assume
16:32 - those two um graphs would scale like
16:35 - like the size uh and and the carbon
16:38 - footprint as well so but we haven't used
16:40 - we should probably have used that in our
16:42 - marketing a lot more but we haven't done
16:44 - that but that so so many so many I
16:46 - remember in the beginning cnra just
16:48 - explained all these benefits and the
16:50 - list goes on like with metadata
16:53 - and yeah the bandwidth the carbon
16:56 - footprint so much so was kind of even
16:58 - though I was a little bit scared for
17:00 - like jumping on a new startup at the
17:03 - time I remember that was kind of what
17:05 - convinced me when I realized that this
17:06 - is just like a fundamentally better way
17:09 - of doing it and if we don't build it
17:11 - someone else I I thought at least would
17:13 - eventually as you said discover this and
17:16 - build them themselves but but it is
17:19 - actually quite quite a lot of difficult
17:21 - technicalities in it like making um a
17:24 - prototype is perhaps not that hard but
17:27 - making it uh polished and work well with
17:29 - the cursor and responsiveness and all
17:32 - that is and bundling and running the
17:35 - projects has has shown to be quite a
17:37 - challenge we spent a lot of time and
17:39 - money U yeah making it work well yeah
17:43 - well I'm you know I'm kind of surprised
17:46 - that like a whole bunch of other
17:47 - companies didn't see this and
17:48 - immediately clone what you were doing uh
17:51 - but I'm not that surprised in the sense
17:54 - that like you think that like there's
17:55 - going to be this really intense
17:56 - competition when you have something that
17:58 - people want but like a lot of big
18:00 - companies and stuff they're just
18:01 - distracted they got all these other
18:02 - things going on and uh yeah like they're
18:05 - going for like I guess more mass market
18:08 - like the audience for people learning
18:09 - the code is relatively small there are
18:12 - only about 30 million professional
18:14 - developers in the world I'd estimate
18:16 - that there are another 30 million or so
18:18 - people that are trying to actively learn
18:19 - to code and um that's not like Facebook
18:24 - or Instagram type total addressable
18:26 - markets right so I think a lot of people
18:29 - just it doesn't occur to them as like a
18:31 - niche that's worth going after which is
18:33 - good you know for you and me because we
18:35 - we can serve those people without having
18:37 - to deal with like a whole lot of
18:39 - competition yeah I I think another thing
18:41 - there is it's very hard for us to expand
18:44 - our catalog because we have to add
18:46 - support for every single thing we we uh
18:49 - we want to create a course on as opposed
18:51 - to a video based platform where you can
18:53 - create courses on anything you can
18:55 - because you just record a video of it so
18:58 - so for that reason it's kind of been
18:59 - hard for us actually to go more into the
19:01 - to the B2B and the Enterprise Market
19:03 - where they have very wide requirements
19:06 - in terms of what kind of clippers and
19:07 - stuff like that we are the niche is kind
19:10 - of yeah protecting us a bit Yeah but to
19:14 - be fair what you're offering is very
19:17 - different from what they're offering
19:18 - because you know to some extent like
19:21 - video courses that have a teacher
19:24 - explaining a concept and maybe have some
19:26 - project that you Cod along home you
19:28 - could argue that that's somewhat
19:29 - commoditized in the sense that anybody
19:31 - can sit down and create a really killer
19:34 - tutorial and publish it on YouTube and
19:36 - get an audience right so but to actually
19:39 - build what you've built which is like
19:42 - very thoughtfully deliberately designed
19:45 - interactive pedagogy that is very
19:48 - difficult you need people that have
19:50 - thought a lot about that or who have
19:51 - like you know a lot of teaching
19:53 - experience and a lot of software
19:54 - development experience who can kind of
19:56 - figure out an optimal way to do that and
19:58 - that's something like to talk about fre
20:00 - go for a second that's something we're
20:01 - very proud of is our core interactive
20:03 - curriculum we we use YouTube as kind of
20:06 - like u a place where we can have videos
20:09 - on every topic but when it comes to the
20:10 - core topics that we think every
20:12 - developer should learn you know the git
20:14 - and the Linux and the SQL and the Python
20:16 - and the JavaScript HTML CSS like we can
20:20 - really take time to build like a
20:22 - deliberate curriculum that teaches those
20:25 - skills in an interactive way and so see
20:28 - in many ways what scrimba is doing is
20:31 - like a different form of interactive
20:33 - than what free C Camp is doing but it's
20:35 - incredibly
20:36 - valuable yeah and I mean free cold cam
20:39 - has been an inspiration for us uh ever
20:42 - since we started giving out courses so
20:43 - yeah the admiration goes uh both ways
20:47 - for
20:47 - sure yeah and I I should point out that
20:50 - that uh you have personally taught some
20:52 - of the courses on the Freo Camp YouTube
20:55 - channel and uh and some of your you know
20:58 - I think Bob zerol yeah is that his name
21:01 - yeah yes amazing teacher like so many so
21:04 - many great teachers coming out of the
21:06 - scrimba camp that are um hanging out and
21:09 - helping kind of essentially take the
21:11 - existing learning resources and Port
21:13 - them to kind of like almost backward
21:15 - compatibility you're back porting them
21:17 - to the old video format but it's still
21:20 - cool to have them in video because that
21:22 - reaches a whole lot of people that are
21:23 - on YouTube and then hopefully many of
21:25 - those people go and do the interactive
21:27 - versions of those courses on scrimba
21:30 - yeah yeah so I have so much I want to
21:34 - talk to you about I want to be mindful
21:35 - of your time but uh maybe you could just
21:38 - very quickly uh tell us like what are
21:41 - some of the the main advantages of
21:44 - learning on scrimba as opposed to
21:46 - watching like the video version of a
21:48 - scrimba
21:49 - video yeah so um the key point is that H
21:54 - you are forced to get your hands on the
21:56 - code uh yeah hands on the keyboard sorry
22:00 - um and write code we kind of have this
22:02 - internal rule where if the student
22:05 - hasn't coded the concept or the learning
22:08 - objective in mind for the scrim then we
22:10 - don't consider it to have been taught we
22:13 - haven't like forced them to like now you
22:15 - take over and do this Challenge and then
22:18 - I will come and show you the solution
22:19 - afterwards like don't skip over it
22:21 - because the only one you're fooling by
22:23 - doing that is yourself so it's kind of
22:26 - that which is the core benefit uh most
22:28 - people um um talk about when they when
22:31 - they try scrimba and and report back
22:34 - that they love but also as you said we
22:36 - put a lot of cont like a lot of effort
22:39 - into our courses into making them uh not
22:41 - like most other courses out there at
22:44 - least most other courses when we started
22:46 - out uh because we we never teach things
22:50 - just for the sake of of teaching the
22:52 - theory it's always an underlying purpose
22:55 - for why we're teaching something it's
22:57 - like it's like it's it's almost not like
22:58 - you're coming to us to learn JavaScript
23:00 - it's like you're coming to us and yes
23:02 - the course is called learn JavaScript
23:04 - but once you're into the course it's
23:05 - like hey how about how cool would it be
23:09 - to have this little blackjack game or
23:12 - this little app that actually solves a a
23:15 - use case in your business for tracking
23:17 - sales leads in your Chrome extension
23:19 - like imagine building something like and
23:21 - having something like that that would be
23:23 - valuable right okay what do we need to
23:26 - learn in order to do that well we need a
23:28 - list of leads how do we represent a list
23:32 - in programming well that's now we got to
23:33 - learn about a Race So it's always that
23:36 - way attacking it from the problem and
23:38 - then down to the what code you need to
23:40 - learn and never like you're going to
23:42 - learn JavaScript here are the five main
23:44 - data types Primitives and complex data
23:47 - types like we very like opinionated in
23:50 - that kind of way of teaching and I think
23:53 - it it's not for everyone but we have
23:55 - definitely found our kind of uh yeah
23:58 - niche in the market of people who like
23:59 - to learn that way yeah awesome well one
24:02 - thing that uh I'm very excited to talk
24:04 - with you about is the burgeoning field
24:07 - of AI engineering now yeah AI
24:10 - engineering of course my friend uh I
24:12 - guess our mutual friend Sean Wang
24:15 - recently had a big AI engineer Summit uh
24:18 - in San Francisco were were you there no
24:21 - froa our co-founder third co-founder he
24:23 - was there okay cool yeah I didn't I
24:26 - didn't get to make it but I did talk to
24:27 - him on a previous episode of the free
24:29 - cam podcast about AI engineering but you
24:32 - are teaching it and yeah you've made it
24:35 - a core focus of scrimba you know you're
24:38 - a a smaller company you have limited
24:41 - resources in terms of what topics you
24:42 - can teach and you decided this is what
24:46 - we're investing our scarce time energy
24:49 - teaching talent in and you've created an
24:51 - AI engineering uh curriculum yeah can
24:55 - you talk a little bit about what a AI
24:58 - engineering
24:59 - is yeah so I think most people who hear
25:02 - uh the phrase AI engineering uh thinks
25:05 - it's more like an AI researcher or
25:07 - machine learning researcher meaning a
25:10 - person who uh trains models and um
25:14 - writes algorithms for for for AI models
25:16 - and it deploys the models and like stuff
25:19 - like that that's not that at all uh it's
25:23 - much much easier than that it's all and
25:25 - it's much closer to a web developer role
25:28 - it is all about taking the these um AI
25:31 - apis that are out there these days or or
25:33 - or you could host them your the open
25:35 - source versions yourself but not like
25:37 - not train them uh yourself and not write
25:40 - the algorithms for them yourself it is
25:42 - about being that kind of top um final
25:46 - layer or final ux layer where you take
25:48 - this amazing new technology and build
25:51 - Next Generation apps with it using like
25:54 - text voice images everything that is
25:57 - popped up over the last few years in
25:59 - generative Ai and it's like it's just so
26:02 - exciting what you can do with it and and
26:04 - and it's a feels like a green field out
26:06 - there where you can just pick new
26:09 - business areas and and industries which
26:12 - haven't gotten AI properly applied um or
26:16 - there AI hasn't been applied to it yet H
26:19 - so so we we just see so many
26:20 - opportunities out there and and had I
26:22 - been a beginner and I today I would have
26:25 - jumped on it immediately uh cuz I think
26:27 - it's great for people's web developers
26:29 - careers these days so so that's why
26:32 - we're we're we're kind of going all in
26:33 - and we want to be the best place to
26:35 - learn that uh because while it isn't
26:38 - that hard to learn uh actually it is
26:41 - very overwhelming and easy to go into uh
26:44 - kind of RAB go down rabbit holes uh and
26:47 - get confused and get paralyzes by
26:49 - analysis and stuff like that yeah so we
26:52 - trying to yeah that that's why we're
26:53 - we're going all in yeah so maybe you
26:56 - could talk a little bit of about uh you
26:59 - said it's not that hard to learn uh but
27:02 - what to learn specifically and not yeah
27:05 - you know getting Hacker News syndrome
27:07 - where you're just looking at like the
27:08 - latest release of whatever oh I need to
27:10 - learn this you know focusing on the core
27:12 - skills the foundation upon which you can
27:14 - build out the rest of your skill set uh
27:17 - maybe you could talk about what those
27:18 - core skills of an AI engineer is and
27:20 - just to be completely clear AI engineer
27:23 - is somebody not necessarily a machine
27:25 - learning engineer as you said who's
27:27 - actually training models but other
27:29 - skills to be able to essentially create
27:32 - like good output from AI or or relevant
27:35 - out output I mean that's how I would
27:37 - very naively describe it does does that
27:39 - make sense uh please feel free to extend
27:42 - that definition no no it makes sense I
27:44 - but I would say not just create relevant
27:47 - output but create uh experiences from it
27:51 - because it I think I think it it one
27:54 - thing that was an epiphany for me was
27:56 - that chat GPT 3.5 uh when like when chat
28:00 - GPT came and it was like GPT 3.5 and not
28:04 - 3.0 yes it was better than 3.0 but I
28:08 - think the actual true um um Innovation
28:13 - there or or just as big of an innovation
28:16 - was the the ux the fact that you just
28:18 - chatted with it I mean if had you tried
28:22 - gpt3 in the playground or or a gpt3
28:25 - based product two months before chat GPT
28:28 - was launched it or I at least got
28:31 - equally mind blown uh when I when I saw
28:34 - that so the techn take off the yeah the
28:37 - user
28:38 - experience uh so that is being able to
28:41 - have a discussion and be able to drill
28:44 - deeper into it because I also like used
28:46 - like the various playgrounds from the
28:48 - previous versions of GPT and I was like
28:50 - this is cool but this is not ready I
28:52 - don't see how I could really use this
28:54 - Beyond you know creating spam or
28:56 - something like that but but once I
28:58 - really sat down especially with GPT 4 in
29:00 - in the but but you're right chat GPT was
29:04 - the key Innovation and open AI didn't
29:07 - see it as the key Innovation they were
29:09 - just like oh this is just some tech demo
29:10 - essentially is is my understanding is
29:13 - kind of how they shipped it but once
29:15 - they saw the usefulness in terms of
29:17 - being able to have conversations is
29:19 - great I you know I use GPT I don't know
29:21 - 10 15 times a day to to ask about
29:24 - various things I use it all the time in
29:26 - language learning for example like full
29:27 - discussions with it in foreign languages
29:29 - and that's incredibly helpful it's like
29:32 - having like a language tutor for free
29:34 - right uh so but not to get too too deep
29:38 - into that but I I think what what you
29:41 - just said there that the chat interface
29:44 - and the ability to iterate on your
29:46 - initial prompt and to delve deeper and
29:48 - to branch and all that stuff that that
29:50 - was a huge Revelation for me personally
29:52 - it sounds like it was for you as
29:54 - well yeah it was H and
29:57 - um I think there's so many more
30:00 - discoveries in that application or ux
30:02 - layer uh to to be found over the next
30:05 - few years and and very often you also
30:09 - need uh in order to to make to get a
30:13 - great experience you also need the
30:15 - context of the product you're working in
30:17 - so yeah it works well to to use chat GPT
30:20 - uh alongside when you're for example
30:22 - coding but when you try
30:25 - copilot or or or any of these other
30:27 - uh tools coding tools that really put it
30:31 - in put the AI in context for you then
30:34 - you realize oh wow this is much better H
30:37 - and I think that goes for all Industries
30:40 - and professions uh that will be uh over
30:42 - the next few years
30:45 - um heavily changed uh as a consequence
30:48 - of this so and what does that mean well
30:50 - it means that there's a ton of work for
30:52 - developers to do in order to build these
30:55 - features and discover these features and
30:57 - especially now that multimodality with
31:00 - voice is is becoming more and more uh
31:03 - streamlined as well yeah just it's like
31:06 - being back in in like right after app
31:08 - store was launched I think and there
31:10 - just like so many opportunities out
31:12 - there yeah now one thing I'll push back
31:15 - on about the App Store is a lot of the
31:19 - best immediate applications that came
31:21 - out of the App Store were just folded
31:23 - back into iOS itself for example there
31:26 - was a time when you could publish a
31:28 - flashlight app and get millions of
31:29 - downloads and everybody be like oh this
31:31 - is amazing because all you're really
31:32 - doing is using like the the API to like
31:35 - turn on the LED on the back of the thing
31:37 - right and you create a cool you could
31:38 - have the coolest flashlight interface in
31:40 - the world but if you open up your phone
31:44 - and uh now you just swipe down and you
31:46 - can just hit the flashlight button and
31:47 - that's so much easier than trying to
31:49 - find a specific flashlight app and going
31:52 - to the trouble of installing it and all
31:53 - that like and GPT is already kind of
31:56 - like like like or I guess the GPT
31:58 - Company open AI has already kind of like
32:00 - demonstrated uh a willingness to quickly
32:03 - like grab some of the most killer apps
32:05 - and like fold them into chat GPT itself
32:08 - for example like do you think that um
32:11 - there's going to be like these obvious
32:13 - kind of applications that are going to
32:16 - get folded in but then if you look at
32:18 - the App Store obviously plenty of apps
32:19 - have prospered uh it's it's like a
32:22 - multi- billion dollar a year ecosystem
32:25 - at this point you you think similar like
32:27 - that GPT specifically and and some of
32:30 - the other llms will have these big app
32:33 - ecosystems or are you thinking more like
32:35 - more like building Enterprise apps on
32:38 - top of these or
32:40 - both yeah so I
32:43 - mean probably both things will happen
32:48 - like open AI will take a lot of the use
32:51 - cases and just fold it into chat GPT and
32:54 - that'll kill a lot of startups
32:57 - that most likely they were already
33:00 - trying to do it it simultaneously I
33:03 - think as well like as I said with with
33:05 - the context being the product as well
33:08 - for example what I've used and I'm
33:09 - really impressed by is Loom if you've
33:11 - tried that um video service you easily
33:14 - create videos and uh they've just
33:16 - integrated AI in such a useful and good
33:19 - way where it
33:20 - automatically creates chapters and
33:23 - summaries and edits and like so many
33:25 - things it does and it it like chat GPT
33:29 - or or open AI couldn't have done that
33:31 - without building a full like Loom
33:33 - competitor and they can't build
33:35 - competitors for all companies in the
33:37 - world uh I think and and I think it's
33:39 - that that'll just be a losing game I
33:42 - think yeah awesome well I'm very excited
33:45 - to see what happens with the ecosystem
33:48 - I'm also excited to see what happens
33:50 - with open source models have you been
33:52 - following development of these open
33:55 - source foundational models
33:58 - yeah so I think it like was quite
34:01 - surprised at how quickly they kind of
34:05 - catched up to to chant
34:07 - GPT at least I mean it still is the gold
34:11 - standard with GPT 4 but um I wouldn't
34:15 - have thought straight straight out of
34:17 - like U 202 at the end of 2022 that uh
34:20 - llama for example that Facebook would
34:22 - come with with with such a good model
34:24 - just a few months after it feels like
34:26 - feels like they all knew this was coming
34:28 - and they were ready there someone just
34:30 - need to needed to take the first step
34:32 - and then all the others came with their
34:33 - own Foundation
34:35 - models but yeah so I've been following
34:37 - that and I think there's many
34:38 - interesting things uh with that and has
34:41 - for example the cost which turns out to
34:44 - be uh quite challenging when using open
34:49 - AI huge element uh of it uh having the
34:52 - control uh internally of the model
34:55 - yourself uh having being able to put
34:57 - your own guard rails around it to to a
34:59 - larger degree yeah and also running it
35:01 - on device I think is super interesting
35:03 - which I've been been checking out or
35:05 - experimenting with in the browser for
35:07 - for one I'll add one thing I'll just
35:10 - jump into ad being able to add your own
35:11 - proprietary data to it without worrying
35:13 - about it leaking uh and being
35:16 - extractable from you know gpc4 like like
35:19 - you can kind of like get it you can do
35:21 - tricks to get it to reveal it training
35:23 - data and stuff like that and if you
35:24 - could do that and your data that you've
35:26 - put it into GPT 4 GPT 5 or whatever is
35:30 - part of the training data or or that
35:32 - some of the information you've already
35:33 - used somehow made it into the next
35:35 - version proprietary you know Trade
35:37 - Secrets could essentially be extracted
35:40 - that way so it's a security
35:42 - consideration um sorry I didn't mean to
35:44 - derail but but no no but it's a great
35:46 - Point like so running on device your own
35:49 - data your own guard rails um so many
35:52 - reasons why having your own model that's
35:56 - potentially running on on your own
35:57 - servers is Superior in a lot of use
36:00 - cases and of course cost uh because
36:03 - gp4 it's expensive to run a model that
36:06 - massive uh it occurred to me that a lot
36:08 - of people may not even know what some of
36:10 - these terms that we're using like
36:12 - Foundation model mean so figured maybe
36:14 - we could do a quick uh question and
36:16 - answer session where you could quickly
36:18 - Define some of these terms that people
36:21 - are likely hearing when they hear about
36:22 - AI engineering let's start with
36:24 - Foundation
36:25 - model yeah so so that's the kind of uh
36:28 - models that can do not one thing not one
36:32 - narrow use case but they are kind of
36:34 - foundational they have some kind of
36:36 - generalized intelligence I would say h
36:39 - and they can
36:40 - do language uh they can talk as a human
36:44 - they can do generate code uh they can
36:47 - they are multimodal much of the or many
36:50 - times multim modals they can deal with
36:52 - images uh and stuff like that so kind of
36:55 - more general not the old kind of narrow
36:58 - classification AI that can just spot a
37:01 - cat in an image and just do that no a
37:03 - foundation model can do many different
37:06 - things okay and what is
37:10 - embedding yeah so an embedding is I
37:14 - think it's a ma mathematical expression
37:16 - which um means to take one object and
37:20 - put it into a new space just a bit
37:23 - abstract but um essentially what it
37:25 - means is that you take from for example
37:27 - one object a paragraph about uh dogs for
37:31 - example and you turn that into you
37:34 - transform that into just a long array of
37:37 - uh numbers of floating Point numbers and
37:40 - those
37:42 - numbers then are a representation of the
37:45 - underlying meaning of that sentence they
37:48 - are an embedding of that paragraph uh
37:51 - but they are of course in a different
37:52 - space since they're now numbers and not
37:54 - like
37:55 - text yeah so that they can
37:58 - essentially play a part in I guess the
38:00 - weightings and how the neural network
38:03 - decides what output to get um
38:07 - and oh go ahead no because then you can
38:10 - actually it's quite cool to see see
38:11 - visualizations of this which we have in
38:13 - our our embeddings course uh where you
38:15 - kind of see that it's very easy Once you
38:17 - have something in an array of numbers
38:20 - it's very easy to mathematically compare
38:22 - the two and the distance between the two
38:24 - so that's how the AI can know that once
38:27 - it has two array two embeddings one of
38:30 - dog and one of cat and one of Saturn
38:33 - it'll it'll see that mathematically dog
38:35 - and cat are closer to each other than
38:38 - Saturn and know that oh these two things
38:40 - make are somewhat semantically connected
38:44 - and what is r a rag as some as people
38:47 - sometimes refer to it
38:50 - quickly so it's one of these uh threel
38:54 - acronyms that scare beginners off but
38:57 - aren't really that complex I feel like
39:00 - developers sometimes like try to come up
39:02 - with with with three-letter acronyms
39:04 - that are uh just to make it hard for
39:06 - people to kind of to understand what
39:08 - they're doing it's not just developers
39:09 - the government loves to come up with
39:11 - three-letter acronyms in the military
39:12 - and yeah maybe maybe it's a human thing
39:16 - to the kind of uh Define The In Crowd
39:18 - and the out crowd anyway okay I'll get
39:21 - to the point so um rag retrieval
39:24 - augmented generation imagine that you
39:26 - have a company uh and you have a bunch
39:29 - of internal data that and you want to
39:31 - create a knowledge Bank where where
39:33 - employees can ask for example like uh
39:36 - what's the vacation policy or refund
39:39 - policy for receipts and blah blah blah
39:41 - that that's obviously data that don't
39:44 - live in chat gpt's uh model or live in
39:48 - their model it's data that lives in a
39:50 - vect or that lives um when you use rag
39:54 - in a vector database in the form of a
39:56 - embeddings so uh rag means that you when
40:00 - you ask the question about what's our
40:01 - vacation policy like the app heads over
40:04 - to a vector database and figures out
40:07 - through your your question and the
40:09 - embeddings that are there and the ma
40:11 - mathematical calculations for for for
40:14 - calculating distance between embeddings
40:16 - it it manages to find the the the
40:19 - information it needs to reply to your
40:22 - question with the the kind of close data
40:25 - that you have in your
40:27 - company uh and and then you then you use
40:30 - chat GPT to or or whatever AI API
40:33 - whatever Foundation model you use to to
40:35 - turn that into more of a conversational
40:37 - reply with the the the data that you
40:40 - fetched via the like the rag um approach
40:44 - if that made sense so rag is essentially
40:47 - a way that you can uh take your own data
40:50 - and get it uh where it can easily
40:53 - quickly interface as opposed to I mean
40:55 - GPT 4 for example can now go and
40:58 - searching with Bing and can pull stuff
41:01 - up too like if I ask like what's the
41:03 - vacation policy of fre C Camp uh or
41:05 - something like that uh then it could
41:07 - potentially scav the web and find that
41:10 - particular thing but it's so much faster
41:12 - if you've got retrieval augmented
41:15 - generation right um rag so it's just one
41:19 - of those things that speeds things up
41:20 - and and ultimately reduces cost because
41:23 - one thing that people may not realize
41:24 - when they're using chat GPT is
41:26 - every single query costs like I don't
41:28 - know like 20 cents or something it's it
41:31 - adds up very quickly like just sitting
41:33 - there talking about like He-Man or
41:35 - something or like the Doom Eternal like
41:38 - lore or something like that which I was
41:40 - I was talking with it about yesterday
41:42 - like that I I cost open AI probably like
41:45 - four or five bucks for my discussion
41:47 - there right and that's why they're
41:48 - taking so much money because it's very
41:49 - expensive but R offers a way to
41:51 - potentially dramatically reduce costs um
41:55 - when you're yeah and also
41:56 - less hallucination as you kind of as
41:59 - it's able to get the the right data uh
42:01 - in the prompt like so the result from
42:04 - from from querying the vector databases
42:06 - so then used in The Prompt so to make
42:09 - the prompt more uh specific and um yeah
42:12 - yeah so I mean you mentioned the term
42:15 - hallucination which is a fun way it we
42:17 - come up for like essentially returning
42:19 - misinformation uh yeah but uh
42:22 - models hallucinated all the time early
42:25 - on uh and yeah like GPT 4 has gotten way
42:29 - better about that by the way like and it
42:30 - may not just be that gp4 has gotten
42:33 - better but also subconsciously like I
42:35 - might just say oh I think that's wrong
42:37 - like I doubt it more so like as people
42:40 - use these models they're going to become
42:41 - more uh skeptical and they're going to
42:42 - give her intuition for like okay does it
42:45 - really know what it's talking about or
42:47 - is it just is it just uh you know
42:50 - spitballing here you know uh and yeah so
42:55 - there are so many things you can do do
42:56 - to reduce those hallucinations and if
42:58 - you're talking about like a customer
43:00 - facing app you don't want it to like
43:02 - hallucinate your price of some product
43:04 - or something like that that could
43:06 - potentially be very catastrophic uh or
43:09 - you don't you don't want us to like
43:10 - hallucinate like legally binding
43:12 - contracts or something like that right
43:15 - um so yeah that is something that well
43:18 - let's talk a little bit about like AI
43:20 - engineering and like what it is that AI
43:23 - Engineers seek to do because we already
43:26 - have you know chat GPT and and we have
43:29 - the open AI
43:30 - API obviously using AI apis like that
43:34 - are part of the AI engineer role but
43:38 - maybe you can talk about like what the
43:40 - main work to be done what the open roles
43:42 - are talk about the field of AI
43:44 - engineering and maybe give people who
43:48 - are watching this listening to
43:50 - this a pitch for why they should
43:52 - consider becoming AI Engineers if
43:54 - they're already working as a front-end
43:55 - developer a full stack
43:57 - developer yeah so why should they I
44:00 - think uh economically it's a good idea
44:03 - because there are just so many managers
44:06 - and uh business owners out there today
44:09 - who feel that uh the AI train is leaving
44:13 - the station and their company is not on
44:16 - it but maybe their competitors are so
44:19 - being a little bit cynical using that uh
44:22 - kind of uh anxiety uh that is in a lot
44:27 - of companies these days with good reason
44:29 - I would say
44:31 - h it will definitely help your career if
44:34 - you're the kind of person that can step
44:35 - up and say hey actually I know some
44:38 - really cool features and and Next
44:39 - Generation things we can build into our
44:41 - or at least experiment with uh in our
44:44 - product by using these API because I
44:46 - know all about rag I know how to create
44:48 - an AI agent I know the AI safety prompt
44:52 - injection uh risks we need to think
44:54 - about uh and I know how to do open
44:56 - source models for example I mean if you
44:58 - if you can come with a pitch like that
45:00 - to your to your boss or to to to a
45:03 - company you want to work for I think
45:05 - it's it's definitely going to open doors
45:08 - uh yeah and it's it's what I would do
45:09 - when I if I had been a beginner now and
45:11 - actually it's also what I would do
45:13 - hadn't I been uh running scrimba I would
45:16 - just probably spend all my time just
45:18 - experimenting with building new kinds of
45:20 - experiences so so that's a fun part I I
45:23 - think um it's it's a lot of fun and and
45:26 - uh it's good for good for your career
45:28 - that's um I think why why people should
45:30 - jump on it so how would you recommend
45:33 - somebody who's interested in breaking
45:34 - into Tech maybe they're learning the
45:36 - code how would you recommend they start
45:39 - using Ai and how do they what should
45:42 - they do to get on the fast track to
45:45 - understanding these tools and being able
45:46 - to leverage
45:48 - them yeah obviously I got to plug our
45:51 - scrimba AI engineering path that that'll
45:53 - kind of take you take you on the fast
45:54 - lane but uh all that aside assuming that
45:58 - you've actually uh learned it one way or
46:01 - another I think there's so many cool
46:03 - things you can do to get attention these
46:05 - days and and get get kind of a an edge
46:09 - on the rest of the um on the rest of the
46:12 - market or the rest of the job Seekers
46:13 - out there what I would have done today I
46:16 - would have actually found my ideal
46:20 - company that I wanted to work for and
46:23 - then I would have uh thought as an AI
46:25 - engineer a what does what what does the
46:27 - dream product or what's one one AI
46:30 - product that this company should have or
46:32 - that it will have in three years maybe
46:35 - it's you want to really want to work for
46:37 - for the biggest law firm in your uh your
46:40 - town right then then I would like okay
46:43 - what's what's an like Law plus AI
46:46 - there's just so many ideas so many
46:48 - things you can do to help lawyers draft
46:51 - documents or read through uh previous
46:54 - law uh law documents ments about um
46:57 - right yeah about um what's the word
47:02 - president uh pres president yeah for
47:05 - example like that or legal president so
47:08 - many things that can be done uh or or
47:11 - marketing tools like quickly help you
47:13 - with your your uh problem uh with your
47:16 - tax problem or just b a bot for that
47:19 - whatever there's so many ways you can go
47:22 - to companies these days and say hey look
47:24 - at this prototype I've built
47:26 - you should really have such a tool in
47:29 - house how about you just hire me and
47:31 - I'll start building these kinds of
47:32 - things for you that that's how I would
47:34 - would try to get my foot in the door in
47:36 - the tech industry today had I been a
47:38 - complete beginner wow okay so just a
47:41 - just a recapitulate what you just said
47:43 - instead of applying you know through web
47:46 - forms or or going to networking events
47:48 - you can do that too but like to build a
47:51 - prototype specifically for the company
47:53 - and say hey have you considered adding
47:55 - this this to this product and using that
47:59 - as a way to potentially get hired on to
48:01 - build precisely that so almost kind of
48:03 - like inventing your own job within that
48:06 - company and your own product or
48:08 - extension of an existing
48:10 - product exactly you could even I mean if
48:13 - you really want to go go the last mile
48:16 - you deploy it with their design on a URL
48:19 - that resembles theirs and like just send
48:21 - it over to them as if fully branded
48:24 - product as well and yeah
48:26 - just don't try that with so many doors
48:29 - cuz in software they created like a a
48:31 - version of Mario that ran on uh windows
48:34 - or or Doss I guess and and Nintendo was
48:37 - like don't distribute this or we'll sue
48:39 - you so it won't it may backfire in some
48:42 - situations but like if you're
48:43 - approaching like probably a big American
48:45 - tech company maybe they'll be more
48:46 - acceptive
48:48 - sorry that person's career though that
48:50 - did it I mean they went on to create
48:53 - great things and it bolstered their
48:54 - reputation uh for being the first you
48:57 - know company to essentially get
48:59 - sidescrolling games working on Doss so
49:03 - yeah yeah I mean it worked out fine for
49:05 - them obviously they're all who who was
49:07 - it did you say in software the the
49:09 - creators of Doom and oh oh oh yeah all
49:13 - those games yeah but but originally they
49:14 - were I read that book masters of Doom
49:17 - but uh forgot about that chapter amazing
49:20 - book so uh it's been an amazing time
49:24 - talking with you I've learned so much
49:26 - about a AI engineering and where you
49:30 - think things are heading we've also
49:31 - heard a whole lot of practical tips for
49:34 - how you can incorporate AI into your
49:36 - daily workflow and potentially learn
49:39 - these tools and go out and create a role
49:41 - for yourself at your dream company so uh
49:45 - per I just want to thank you again for
49:46 - coming on the free code Camp podcast
49:49 - it's been a pleasure man likewise and uh
49:53 - thank you so much for for having me and
49:54 - for being a scrimba supporter ever since
49:57 - uh day one yeah yeah again just I love
50:01 - the invention the discovery that is uh
50:04 - scriba so it's it's been amazing to
50:06 - follow your journey over the years and
50:09 - uh excited to talk with you again in the
50:10 - future um everybody watching this until
50:15 - next week happy
50:16 - coding happy coding
