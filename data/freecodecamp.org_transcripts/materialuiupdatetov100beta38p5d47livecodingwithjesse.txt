00:05 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:09 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today I'm
00:12 - streaming from a recliner in my basement
00:15 - and I guess I do have a robe on so I'm
00:22 - gonna try to stream if you all have seen
00:24 - streams in the past when I tried to
00:26 - stream from home
00:27 - we'll be had some problems with quality
00:29 - of the stream so I've turned down the
00:32 - settings from you know what I've used in
00:35 - the past hopefully it'll work keep me up
00:39 - to date on how it's looking on your end
00:42 - I've been testing it out for maybe the
00:45 - past you know five minutes or so and I
00:49 - don't sometimes it's write it in you
00:52 - know all right
00:53 - sometimes it drops down so it's just not
00:57 - I'm not sure I don't have very much else
01:01 - running on my on my computer this may be
01:04 - a good excuse to buy a more powerful
01:06 - computer also sorry about the background
01:10 - noise so my home office is also in the
01:14 - laundry room and there's laundry running
01:16 - right now I think it's almost finished
01:18 - though so let me know if the noises is
01:23 - too terrible and maybe I could just shut
01:27 - it off but I think it should be done in
01:29 - a few minutes okay all right so I'm
01:35 - trying to check the analytics just to
01:37 - see what kind of quality or getting
01:40 - alright it's not looking really good I
01:42 - don't have a lot of data right now but
01:43 - it's it's not looking great okay we do
01:47 - have some 720p streams going alright
01:55 - okay it looks like okay John saying
01:59 - there is some lag here okay I was hoping
02:03 - this would work
02:07 - but they have to try to figure something
02:10 - out if I want to be able to do these
02:12 - from home so let's give it a shot today
02:17 - the what we're gonna try to do today is
02:21 - upgrade to material UI version the the
02:28 - beta version points was a 3/8 yeah point
02:32 - three eight all right so there are some
02:36 - breaking changes and I'll bring those
02:40 - over on the screen in a second I have
02:42 - them on my my other screen but that's
02:45 - we're gonna do today so I'm right off
02:47 - the bat we're just gonna start with that
02:48 - we're gonna update on a separate branch
02:51 - and we're gonna see how many things
02:53 - break and so alright cool the washing
03:02 - machine it's now finished so hopefully
03:05 - it'll help with the background noise my
03:08 - setup too it's not as good as my work
03:09 - setup I don't have an external mic so if
03:13 - I'm gonna do this more from home I think
03:15 - I'm gonna get a camera and a mic that'll
03:21 - be a little bit better but for now
03:25 - hopefully this will work well enough and
03:29 - let's see oh let me switch screen so
03:33 - y'all can see what I see all right so
03:35 - here's our package.json this is what we
03:38 - have right now it's your UI beta 29 so
03:43 - we're trying to upgrade all the way to
03:46 - 38 so let's see how many breaking
03:49 - changes we have before we start this
03:53 - let's pull this over let's try to zoom
03:59 - in all right so let's let's go all the
04:02 - way down to the version we're on now and
04:03 - just kind of go up and see what we're
04:05 - what we're dealing with so if you want
04:08 - to check this out just go to the
04:10 - material UI repo on github and click on
04:17 - the releases and you can see all this as
04:19 - well
04:22 - while I'm scrolling I tested out
04:25 - deploying this site using now and it
04:29 - worked I ran it through some issues what
04:33 - one mainly is now runs by default HTTP
04:38 - we're still pulling data from that test
04:41 - WordPress server that is not HTTP so
04:48 - probably gonna get the WordPress on to
04:51 - its own
04:52 - droplet at some point and give it a real
04:57 - URL you know with encryption Wow
05:03 - okay it took awhile to get there all the
05:05 - way down to the bottom so this is where
05:07 - we're at now but anyway I was impressed
05:10 - with how easy it was to deploy to now
05:12 - I'm and how fast it was you all know we
05:16 - have done pretty much no optimization
05:18 - for speed yet and it was really fast
05:21 - so I'm super happy about that so we'll
05:27 - probably be doing more with that as we
05:29 - get closer to the launch date which is
05:31 - still to be determined
05:34 - okay so we're just gonna look for
05:36 - breaking changes there we are so
05:42 - breaking changes so we'll have to keep
05:46 - in mind buttons I don't think we're
05:51 - using tabs we definitely are using
05:54 - typography okay so that need to keep
06:00 - that in mind I'm just gonna scroll
06:02 - through it quickly right now and that
06:07 - way like will at least have in mind what
06:09 - to look for when we update it and we're
06:11 - trying to look for things that are
06:12 - broken and then as we deal with each
06:15 - issue we can read you know more in-depth
06:19 - into each thing as we need to fix it let
06:22 - me start my poem with or a timer as well
06:26 - maybe area so if you're asking questions
06:31 - right now in the chat I do Pomodoro
06:33 - session
06:34 - so after 25 minutes I'll take a little
06:38 - break I'll come back to the chat and
06:39 - I'll answer any questions that you all
06:41 - have so please be patient and I will get
06:45 - to your questions okay well it's gonna
06:56 - be a lot of breaking changes
06:57 - okay so icons are we I think we're using
07:02 - SVG icons which I believe is a separate
07:07 - it's a separate thing okay maybe some
07:15 - changes to the themes all right Wow
07:22 - we'll see okay let's keep going another
07:29 - breaking change okay for more buttons
07:38 - okay so we're changing to using variant
07:41 - for a lot of these so we had we had seen
07:45 - this change before at some point oh yeah
07:51 - we were looking something up in the
07:53 - documentation and they were telling us
07:54 - to use variant but we hadn't updated to
07:56 - that version yet so so we were aware of
07:59 - this we'll definitely have to keep that
08:02 - in mind that's I mean that's gonna be
08:07 - something that will for sure need to
08:08 - update and yeah that one is know
08:13 - breaking changes alright here's more
08:17 - breaking changes
08:27 - okay we may have to switch up our type
08:31 - for our inputs we don't have too many
08:36 - inputs we do have a few the alright no
08:40 - change is there just a small breaking
08:45 - change here
08:57 - okay so just don't have a font size
09:00 - property I'm not sure if we were using
09:03 - that anyway so I think we're fine here I
09:07 - if I remember correctly I'm pretty sure
09:09 - we use CSS to change the font size all
09:14 - right getting close more breaking
09:17 - changes
09:32 - interesting
09:47 - okay let's see alright alright we're
09:56 - gonna have a lot of stuff to deal with
09:58 - this might be more than one day of
10:03 - working through these changes so
10:05 - definitely going to do this on a branch
10:06 - this is not gonna be something that we
10:11 - want to do on our master branch it
10:14 - potentially this this could be breaking
10:17 - things for you know a few days until we
10:20 - get everything sorted out alright so
10:22 - let's get to the code and let's let's go
10:27 - to our docks here this is the
10:28 - documentation for material UI just to
10:31 - show you you know how we how we update
10:35 - this we're just gonna get material UI at
10:38 - next and that's gonna give us the latest
10:43 - pre-release and that's what we want so
10:47 - you know we go into this and we use
10:49 - things that are still in beta this is
10:52 - what you you deal with this is kind of
10:54 - the cost of of using the latest thing so
10:58 - you know that was that was something
11:00 - that we are willing to work with but
11:02 - we're definitely gonna have to you know
11:04 - keep up with this I just checked in the
11:09 - lab chat it's uh someone says speak
11:12 - Hindi please unfortunately I do not know
11:15 - how to speak Hindi so apologies for that
11:19 - I know there are a lot of viewers from
11:23 - India but I don't I don't know really
11:29 - anywhere it's at all in Hindi so sorry
11:33 - about that okay alright so this is how
11:39 - it looks now I just wanted to take one
11:41 - last look before we potentially mess it
11:43 - all up alright so here is our terminal
11:49 - and we have the package.json file open
11:52 - so we should see this switch over to the
11:55 - new version when we run this so I'm
11:57 - gonna do a yarn ad and I'm just gonna
11:59 - paste that
12:00 - material.you I next end right there I
12:07 - did notice okay Nikki says the page is
12:12 - skipping so drunk dropping frames oh
12:14 - yeah you know what I do have a yeah it's
12:19 - showing up like a point six percent
12:22 - point seven percent yet for some reason
12:25 - actually this makes sense so while this
12:28 - is running I'm dropping frames IIIi
12:34 - think the problem is the problems
12:40 - definitely with with my computer I mean
12:48 - my internet connection is fine to handle
12:49 - this and I me very obviously frames drop
12:54 - when we run things so michael says
13:00 - branch yeah i forgot to make the branch
13:01 - will make it after this so i frequently
13:07 - forget to do a branch when i'm doing to
13:09 - change or i start to make a change and
13:11 - don't realize like how much of a change
13:13 - it's gonna be beforehand so there you
13:18 - can make a branch afterwards and
13:21 - everything will work so what we're gonna
13:24 - do now and you can see we've we've
13:26 - updated to beta 38 that's awesome so now
13:33 - what we're gonna do instead of saving
13:36 - what we've done on the master branch we
13:40 - are going to make a branch now so we're
13:44 - going to do git branch let's say get
13:49 - check out we're gonna do beef leg that
13:52 - way we'll go right into the new branch
13:54 - and let's call this mui 38 and that way
14:09 - we know exactly what was going on here
14:10 - on this branch
14:11 - hopefully we won't need it for that long
14:15 - okay so now we have on this branch all
14:20 - the changes that we want when I go back
14:22 - to the master branch we'll be back on
14:26 - that beta 29 and I can just run yarn
14:30 - again to change the packages on this
14:34 - machine and really everywhere else you
14:37 - know it'll be fine since we haven't
14:39 - pushed any of this yet so so anyway if
14:43 - you have run into the situation like
14:45 - that that's all you need to do just
14:49 - don't commit anything a master just make
14:53 - your branch switch over to your branch
14:56 - and do all your commits there and then
14:58 - you come back master will be clean with
15:01 - with no changes so it looks like yeah
15:08 - the stream the frame rates not doing too
15:10 - well it's starting to get better now all
15:16 - right sorry about that is at least it is
15:19 - the audio at least working so somebody
15:21 - let me know in the live chat please as
15:24 - long as the audio is working I think
15:26 - it's worthwhile to keep the stream going
15:28 - and I'll do my best to describe
15:30 - everything in case the the video is is
15:35 - lagging a lot maybe at the end of the
15:40 - stream we can go on Amazon and look for
15:42 - new computers no I don't know if you
15:45 - heard that that was my wife in the other
15:46 - room saying no
15:56 - okay cool so the audio is good alright
15:59 - so we'll keep going this is not ideal
16:01 - but I'll do my best to narrate so let's
16:08 - check out what actually happened let's
16:11 - let's click around ok I'm gonna do a
16:20 - refresh just to I shouldn't need to
16:23 - refresh cuz we have you know like the
16:25 - hot reloading and stuff but sometimes it
16:29 - requires a refresh
16:40 - okay so far it's just really slow no
16:46 - weird air is on this face we'll just
16:48 - scroll a bit if I can okay okay this all
17:03 - looks pretty good cool very cool
17:12 - even our buttons the buttons are custom
17:16 - so that makes sense that they work let's
17:18 - try to our side over here okay things
17:27 - are really slow that's most likely just
17:29 - my computer though you gotta remember to
17:35 - change that hover color Wow super slow
17:44 - okay all right not bad wow wow this is
17:55 - really not bad I just want to double
17:56 - check and make sure yeah we do we do we
17:58 - upgraded all right you know what let's
18:04 - go to that search page because we have
18:06 - some inputs happening there so let's see
18:12 - there's a search page I'm not running
18:16 - any rock today too so I don't know if
18:18 - anybody asked about that yet but since
18:21 - my computer can't even handle what we're
18:24 - doing right now I'm not gonna attempt to
18:27 - run in Grug so sorry about that Matthew
18:35 - says to check the frame rate you know
18:38 - what I I turn the frame rate down to 30
18:41 - and I mean is what's the video like if
18:48 - you go below 30 frames per second is it
18:52 - watchable I mean
18:54 - how low can I reasonably go I wonder I
19:06 - have a a Windows machine that has what
19:12 - used to have pretty decent RAM in a
19:14 - graphics card it's a little bit old but
19:19 - I may be able to get better performance
19:22 - out of it so maybe I ought to try to
19:25 - install everything I need on that and
19:27 - try to stream from that at some point so
19:31 - that's another option I'll have to get
19:33 - used to it
19:33 - the developing on Windows again ok so
19:38 - alright cool it looks like we click
19:42 - things work kind of ok yeah that wow
19:58 - that does work that's amazing and
20:02 - everything looks pretty much the same as
20:06 - we've had it we're not even getting
20:10 - we're not even getting any errors I mean
20:17 - is it possible that we could be this
20:20 - lucky Matthew says do you have slack
20:23 - open or a bunch of chrome tabs open
20:25 - you know I closed out almost all my tabs
20:27 - let me double check I'm gonna double
20:30 - check just to make sure I don't have
20:31 - anything like minimize that I forgot
20:34 - about all right so at my timer you -
20:39 - yeah
20:40 - nothing nothing out of the ordinary
20:44 - what's this one ok I can't close this
20:48 - stuff so I found two tabs that I didn't
20:51 - need so we'll close that down almost up
20:55 - running I have Spotify running maybe I
20:57 - should turn off Spotify - alright sorry
21:00 - music Spotify is off
21:07 - okay I think that's about all I can do I
21:11 - could turn off I term too and then run
21:16 - the server all right I don't know we'll
21:20 - see maybe turn it Spotify off will help
21:25 - maybe I'll try running Spotify from my
21:27 - phone next time alright so Niki notices
21:33 - the color of the checkboxes is different
21:35 - okay I thought that might be the case I
21:39 - couldn't remember exactly what color we
21:41 - had okay alright so we noticed one one
21:47 - thing so far let's check out maybe some
21:50 - of this
21:52 - alright that looks good I want to check
21:55 - this again because I didn't really look
21:57 - that closely yeah that works
22:02 - Wow okay so so far the only thing that
22:14 - we've noticed is the color on checkboxes
22:19 - is different which I'm really glad
22:21 - something's different I was starting to
22:23 - worry that we didn't actually update
22:25 - anything somehow it just didn't work
22:29 - okay wow I I mean this is good this is a
22:39 - really good surprise I just thought
22:41 - based on you know all the breaking
22:44 - changes document it I just assumed that
22:46 - stuff would be really messed up Wow I
22:56 - mean let's let's take a look somewhere
23:00 - that we know we're using some things
23:02 - that change so there were some things
23:03 - that changed about buttons you know let
23:06 - me check my timer all right eight
23:08 - minutes Oh
23:09 - in about eight minutes I'm going to come
23:11 - back to the live chat answer a bunch of
23:13 - questions and we may wrap things up
23:15 - early since we don't have a lot of
23:17 - issues and
23:18 - is kind of not going too well
23:25 - so yeah let's check out our hero
23:31 - component that's I think we have buttons
23:34 - in there now we did use that custom
23:39 - button so oops that so we are okay so
23:48 - we're importing our custom version of
23:51 - that button so maybe that is why our
23:55 - buttons still work because we yeah that
24:01 - is what okay so our buttons are all
24:04 - gonna work that are using this one
24:06 - because this was a modified version of
24:08 - the regular button component so this has
24:12 - not changed at all even though the
24:15 - regular button component did change so
24:17 - we'll just have to decide if we want to
24:19 - update this based on the changes or not
24:22 - but I guess that explains that
24:25 - typography has changed so we can check
24:28 - out what's going on with typography the
24:32 - thing that I believe we did though is we
24:39 - we did use a lot of custom CSS to kind
24:43 - of override things so I think that's I
24:46 - mean I don't know if you all have any
24:49 - theories on why everything still looks
24:52 - okay let me know but to me that seems to
24:54 - be the best explanation is that we just
24:56 - overrode a lot of this stuff and it's so
25:08 - we were okay I just saw something funny
25:12 - in the live chat so I just got to say
25:14 - this so Michael says professor Bonjour
25:17 - doesn't teach French does he know so
25:22 - Andy Bonjour he used to work in my
25:26 - department and then he got really fancy
25:29 - and got a degree and became a teacher
25:31 - but he's
25:32 - good guy my son and one of his sons
25:35 - they're best friends but no he does not
25:37 - teach French he's in the Communication
25:39 - Arts Department he does video stuff but
25:43 - and he has a really epic beard too much
25:45 - longer than mine he's a good guy but we
25:48 - do have a dr. Plato who does teach
25:54 - philosophy so I mean that's perfect like
25:58 - he was destined to be a philosophy it's
26:00 - philosopher you know from birth
26:06 - Nietzsche says in the student profile
26:08 - card variant changed okay so we have the
26:13 - change here with typography - I want to
26:16 - go back since I have a typography
26:18 - component here I want to go back and see
26:20 - what changed so let's check that out
26:31 - okay so instead of type we're gonna have
26:35 - variance that's so odd it's still
26:43 - working I mean if they say breaking
26:46 - change that usually means like it's not
26:49 - there's no backwards compatibility right
27:09 - now let's just check I think we were
27:12 - looking at this see how it still looks
27:15 - fine I mean let's use variant and see
27:21 - what happens so I'll just do these top
27:24 - two we'll save that and see if there's a
27:34 - change
27:42 - wait a second for this reload here
27:56 - oh okay Wow all right so that changed
28:02 - things a lot I'm definitely gonna undo
28:10 - that
28:29 - I'm running yarn again just to be sure
28:37 - yeah I mean I I was pretty sure that it
28:41 - works but okay so I don't think I'm
28:47 - gonna change things over to variant
28:49 - right now maybe with new components will
28:53 - use variant instead I mean obviously
28:55 - when we go to the docs we're gonna be
28:56 - using the new stuff recommended by the
28:58 - docs which will be the latest so you
29:02 - know we'll do that but in terms of what
29:06 - we have already nikki says in student
29:12 - profile carl card variant changed the
29:21 - cards i mean it it looks it looks okay
29:25 - tell me what else would have the other
29:28 - thing I can see and this may have
29:29 - already been like that before is this
29:32 - could probably do with a little bit of a
29:35 - heavier font weight just for readability
29:42 - but other than that it looks okay hmm
29:48 - all right let me check okay so I only
29:51 - got about a minute minute 30 left so I'm
29:55 - just gonna go to the live chat now and
29:58 - I'm actually gonna shut down some of
30:03 - what I have going on here so I'm gonna
30:04 - shut down my local development
30:09 - environment here and shouldn't have done
30:13 - that
30:14 - because I needed to run tests shoot all
30:17 - right let me let me spit it back up
30:21 - again yeah so yeah if you try to commit
30:32 - things if you're if you're committing to
30:35 - this project you do need to have the
30:38 - server running
30:42 - to run all the tests so you won't be
30:45 - able to commit without it I mean you
30:48 - could force the commit but usually don't
30:52 - want to do that okay all right so let's
30:57 - at least commit this get Ad and let's do
31:04 - whoops yarn see em
31:18 - okay sure now what is it
31:43 - what the name is
31:55 - I guess we'll call it a chore for right
31:56 - now
32:06 - [Music]
32:25 - breaking changes yeah oh yes it does
32:43 - affect an open issue what is that issue
32:47 - I can't remember the name of the issue
32:53 - let's try to get back
33:05 - I'm sorry the number of the issue
33:28 - well this issue's kind of old because we
33:30 - were gonna update to beta 33 so issue 81
33:53 - all right there we Michael Patterson
34:01 - just asked about an end Rock link
34:03 - I'm not running in got a knock right now
34:05 - because I'm I'm streaming from my laptop
34:08 - that's not very powerful so I didn't
34:13 - want to try to run and rock as well I
34:15 - mean I I didn't think he could handle it
34:16 - in stream at the same time
34:19 - all right impasse we are passing Wow I
34:23 - really just take for granted how nice my
34:28 - my iMac is at work and so I try to do
34:32 - stuff like this and see how long it
34:34 - takes so for those of you that have
34:37 - slower machines I admire your
34:43 - determination and patience because this
34:47 - stuff takes a long time
34:56 - Wow okay while I wait on that I'm gonna
35:02 - start in on the live chat so I'm gonna
35:12 - scroll all the way up to the top and try
35:15 - to answer all the questions if you have
35:17 - a question you know please put it in the
35:19 - live chat now I'll do my best to answer
35:24 - it and we have a lot of really
35:25 - knowledgeable people in the chat that
35:28 - can also help answer the questions
35:50 - Ricardo says greetings from Venezuela
35:52 - hello thanks for watching
35:57 - gamer D asked why the background is all
36:01 - black I'm not sure if you mean the
36:04 - background to my screen why it's all
36:10 - black I was running the dark thing on
36:12 - github and I'm running dark themes on
36:16 - pretty much everything so that could be
36:18 - it if you mean why the it's black behind
36:22 - me and in my little video in the corner
36:24 - I usually work with the lights off to
36:27 - cut down on the glare on the screen so
36:31 - that's that's why it's it's so dark I
36:35 - pretty much the only reason you can see
36:38 - my face is because of the lighting from
36:40 - the monitors you can see the light
36:43 - changes as I switch from a dark screen
36:45 - to a lighter screen
37:06 - Oh after all that we didn't pass
37:16 - Oh timeout all right let's just force
37:20 - this because it's so slow I'd hate to do
37:27 - that how do we force it with that let's
37:34 - see if we can do this I can't remember
37:49 - what the area no verify I'm not sure if
37:56 - this will work is it working
38:11 - or is it gonna try to run everything
38:13 - again I hope it doesn't try to run all
38:21 - the tests again well it is going a lot
38:28 - faster the Sun alright so Gannon for you
38:35 - I'm assuming that's Gannon from The
38:38 - Legend of Zelda videogames so awesome
38:40 - I'm a big fan of those began in four
38:43 - uses hello first time I see the
38:45 - livestream from you so I want to thank
38:47 - you for taking the time for streaming
38:49 - and a heart emoji so hey I appreciate
38:53 - that I'm really sorry that the first
38:55 - live string you see is such poor video
38:57 - quality I sorry I just got distracted by
39:10 - that error message but anyway I
39:11 - appreciate you saying that and welcome
39:13 - to the stream hopefully you can make it
39:15 - for more streams and for sure if you
39:17 - have any questions about anything that
39:19 - I'm doing just just let me know I'm
39:20 - happy to go you'll go back over things
39:28 - alright I'm not gonna mess with this any
39:31 - more during the stream I'm just gonna
39:36 - let it do its thing and fix it
39:38 - afterwards
39:52 - oh okay
39:57 - Matthew uh sorry I didn't see this
39:59 - message earlier but Matthew Potter is
40:03 - saying when he had this similar problem
40:06 - he switched to Firefox and completely
40:10 - got out of chrome and that fixed
40:12 - everything that's not a bad idea if I
40:15 - switch to a more lightweight less
40:17 - resource-intensive browser then it might
40:23 - work all right that we're pretty we're
40:28 - almost done the stream so I'm not gonna
40:29 - try it right now but that's a great idea
40:33 - all right I'm gonna do a little bit of
40:36 - research and and find out what browser
40:38 - uses the least amount of resources and
40:40 - still can handle the code that we're
40:43 - using if you all know what browser is
40:47 - ahead of time let me know it will save
40:48 - me some time in research but that's a
40:51 - great idea I mean every little bit can
40:53 - help I suppose all right it looks like
40:56 - that actually went through awesome so
41:00 - let's do good all right so now what
41:10 - we've done which isn't really much we is
41:14 - now on github github so if you want to
41:17 - check it out
41:17 - and pull it down to your local machine
41:19 - and and see what's happening feel free
41:23 - and if you want to use any of the code
41:26 - in any of the repos that I have or that
41:28 - are in the fus marcom or getup
41:30 - organization you know feel free it's
41:33 - it's all it's all open source I think we
41:41 - have put would MIT license on everything
41:48 - haiya coding in caffeine is here it says
41:51 - hi code eaters and coffee drinkers cool
41:55 - good to have you
42:04 - okay Blake says the Spotify web player
42:08 - takes up less resources than the desktop
42:14 - app is that that makes sense I didn't
42:17 - think about that so maybe I'll I'll use
42:19 - that as well I I don't really need the
42:22 - music and I could run it off of my phone
42:25 - so I'll maybe I'll just try to run off
42:30 - my phone next time our Blake saying
42:37 - there is a terminal B Eska yeah I well I
42:40 - mean I'm using terminal D s code and
42:43 - then I was also using these terminals so
42:46 - let me just get rid of this right now
42:50 - yeah there we go let's make sure shut it
42:58 - down okay
43:05 - there's one more thing shutdown at DISA
43:15 - sorry if I'm mispronouncing that but
43:17 - Odysseus says you should stream on
43:19 - Twitch - you know what a while back I
43:22 - did make a twitch account because I had
43:25 - thought about the streaming on there as
43:27 - well but just I haven't done it yet I'm
43:31 - still kind of open to the idea of doing
43:33 - it but it's just one more place to have
43:37 - to organize things so not really sure I
43:40 - mean if if I was gonna stream on Twitch
43:42 - maybe I would do some different content
43:44 - maybe not exactly the same stuff that
43:47 - I'm doing now on maybe I'll play like
43:51 - old-school Starcraft on Twitch and just
43:57 - not even do coding or do a totally
43:59 - different type of coatings
44:23 - Andrew asked if I tried lowering the
44:25 - bitrate I did I did lower the bitrate as
44:27 - well so this bit rate and the bit rate
44:32 - is significantly lower than what I use
44:34 - on my my iMac and I think I did switch
44:39 - to 30 frames per second on my iMac as
44:41 - well so the frame rates the same but I
44:43 - mean maybe I could try for a lower
44:45 - bitrate it's just only I mean I wanted
44:48 - to at least make it possible for people
44:50 - to stream 720p I think the the font is
44:54 - just too fuzzy if you go lower than that
44:58 - so I need to keep the bitrate high
45:01 - enough to achieve 720p so maybe I'll
45:03 - look up exactly what range I need to be
45:06 - in for that and see if I can lower that
45:07 - a little bit more okay Nikki says the
45:11 - Firefox developer edition okay cool
45:16 - or oh michael says firefox Kuantan and
45:19 - Chrome Canary depending okay I do I
45:23 - don't know if I have canary on this
45:25 - machine I think I just have canary at
45:28 - work but I'm wondering you know what I
45:31 - do want to try Firefox quantum so
45:33 - Firefox dev Edition and Firefox quantum
45:35 - which one's faster of the two does
45:37 - anybody have experience with that also
45:44 - Gurpreet Singh says hi hey how's it
45:47 - going welcome to the stream so I've
45:53 - gotten to the bottom of the live the
45:55 - live chat I'm just gonna give it you
45:57 - know a few more seconds because I know
45:59 - there's a delay to see if anyone has
46:01 - anything else to say about Firefox
46:03 - quantum and the Firefox dev edition and
46:09 - then I'll probably wrap things up who
46:13 - knows a little bit shorter stream than
46:14 - normal really so sorry about the quality
46:18 - I'm definitely gonna try to change some
46:22 - things and get that fixed before I
46:23 - attempt to stream again
46:30 - Oh Matthew says the video is is really
46:34 - smooth now what was the solution ah I
46:37 - think the solution was just shutting
46:39 - down as much as I possibly could and not
46:42 - doing any worse so I'm I'm barely even
46:46 - moving my mouse right now so I really
46:50 - think that's that's it so really I I
46:59 - mean the only thing I did you saw it on
47:01 - the screen is I completely shut down my
47:04 - I term so I was using I term too so
47:09 - maybe maybe I'll do that I have no
47:13 - problem not running I turn to I just I
47:17 - don't know if I can run to terminal
47:20 - windows in vs code maybe I'll just look
47:22 - it up and see because I need the run the
47:25 - local dev server in one and then still
47:28 - be able to use get in the other okay
47:34 - Nicki says it's the same quantum is the
47:36 - name for the new Firefox okay cool all
47:39 - right yeah I had that really confused
47:41 - all right so so basically Nicki and
47:44 - Michael you were both talking about the
47:46 - same version of Firefox correct which is
47:49 - called Firefox quantum I think I'm gonna
47:53 - load that like as soon as I in the
47:55 - stream I'm just gonna load it so I don't
47:56 - forget well I mean I'm really glad the
48:02 - stream is going well now too bad I'm
48:06 - ending it right when it started to have
48:08 - good quality but I really think I could
48:11 - notice you know OBS if you used it you
48:14 - know it shows you your framerate
48:16 - statistics and everything you know right
48:18 - there and as I would do stuff you know
48:21 - over here and in the terminal even like
48:24 - doing stuff in chrome like hitting the
48:26 - refresh button I can see the framerate
48:29 - like the percentage of frames that I was
48:31 - dropping just start going off and then
48:35 - whenever I stopped doing that you could
48:36 - see it go down so definitely I mean
48:42 - maybe his computers
48:44 - just just can't handle it oh cool Blake
48:52 - says you can run multiple terminals in
48:54 - Visual Studio code awesome it seems like
48:57 - something that you would expect to be
48:59 - able to do I just didn't never took the
49:01 - time to look it up so I I appreciate
49:03 - that you let me know about that I think
49:08 - yeah there's really not gonna be any for
49:10 - me to run I term too anymore if I can do
49:12 - that alright so the plus sign is gonna
49:25 - give me another term what oh that's cool
49:32 - and I can split it what this is so cool
49:42 - Wow what all right this is it was so
49:53 - this made it for me so worth it to
49:56 - stream now that I know that that is
50:00 - awesome so let me see how let me give
50:05 - credit alright so a few of you were
50:07 - telling me about it so Blake saying you
50:09 - can do it and Nicki says you can even
50:12 - split the windows Michael said the plus
50:14 - sign next to the drop down awesome so
50:17 - Blake Nicki and Michael thank you so
50:20 - much for that that's gonna be super
50:22 - useful for me and it'll be one less
50:25 - program that I need to run now which is
50:28 - really cool Nicki's also saying alright
50:35 - so Andrew says bitrate for 720p is whoa
50:40 - 2,500 to 4,000 whoa yeah there's no way
50:45 - I can get that bitrate on this machine
50:48 - [Music]
50:50 - Nicki says try streaming with the
50:52 - special h.264 thing options
50:57 - [Music]
50:59 - CRF or something option in OBS oh yeah
51:04 - let me check that option for a second I
51:06 - remember seeing that where it is
51:13 - [Music]
51:21 - all in the encoder okay yeah I'm not
51:25 - using it right now maybe I'll have to
51:27 - use that then alright I'll try that so
51:32 - definitely I have a lot of good ideas
51:34 - for how to make the stream quality
51:36 - better next time so first I'm gonna try
51:41 - to make it work with this laptop and
51:43 - just by adjusting settings and doing
51:45 - some there changing what browser I use
51:48 - and if that still doesn't work then I'm
51:51 - gonna try using a different computer I'm
51:54 - going to switch to a Windows desktop
51:55 - that should be a little more powerful
51:59 - than then the laptop so that's the plan
52:05 - for the next time I stream I'm gonna be
52:07 - doing probably more streams from home
52:11 - then I then I normally do so I
52:13 - definitely want to get this working so
52:15 - like I said I'm potentially gonna get
52:19 - you know a a more kind of decent setup
52:23 - than I have right now huh I mean I have
52:25 - the laptop in my lap so I apologize for
52:27 - any shaking I know that would probably
52:31 - make me motion sick apologize maybe I'll
52:35 - try to get better lighting as well
52:36 - better mic things like that alright so I
52:43 - think that's it for me there's no more
52:45 - questions in the live chat thank you all
52:46 - so much for hanging in here I mean I
52:48 - can't believe how many people are still
52:49 - viewing even after the the terrible
52:52 - quality of the stream so I really
52:54 - appreciate you all putting up with that
52:55 - Oh Andrew says just googled it again and
53:00 - you actually only need 1500 minimum for
53:04 - 720p ok that's that's much more doable
53:08 - so thanks for that Andrew I really
53:11 - appreciate that alright so I'm going to
53:16 - end the stream thank you all so much for
53:18 - watching for your patience and for your
53:20 - help this ended up being way easier than
53:23 - expected I'm sure as we keep going we'll
53:27 - probably find some other things that
53:29 - maybe don't work like we wanted them to
53:32 - work that we just couldn't see right
53:34 - now so I'm not saying it's completely
53:38 - like a hundred percent works but it's
53:40 - way better than I expected
53:44 - [Music]
53:46 - cool alright now the stream is perfect
53:49 - yeah so alright so evidently it is
53:52 - possible to stream with this computer I
53:55 - just need to do nothing so if I'm gonna
54:00 - talk only then I can stream all right so
54:04 - anyway thank you so much for watching
54:05 - and I will see you all tomorrow
