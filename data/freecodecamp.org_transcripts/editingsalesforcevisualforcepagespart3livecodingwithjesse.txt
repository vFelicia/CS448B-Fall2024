00:09 - hey everybody welcome to live-streaming
00:12 - with live coding with Jessie and today
00:17 - we're just going to continue on with
00:18 - what we were doing yesterday I haven't
00:21 - yeah I don't think I've done anything
00:25 - since yesterday it's been working on
00:28 - other things so there's nothing to catch
00:34 - you up on
00:34 - only if you haven't seen any of these
00:37 - the last two streams we're working on an
00:41 - application page so it's basically just
00:45 - a big forum a really big forum well it's
00:51 - a big forum and this is running in
00:54 - Salesforce which is a platform that a
00:59 - lot of businesses use in particular the
01:03 - type of page in Salesforce is called a
01:06 - visualforce page and they have this
01:08 - templating system I think they call it
01:11 - Apex it has these apex tags and we'll
01:14 - see that in a minute when we get to the
01:15 - code but today we're not really going to
01:17 - be messing too much with that we're
01:19 - gonna deal almost exclusively with CSS
01:23 - maybe maybe completely CSS so this
01:28 - should be nice for those of you that
01:31 - maybe aren't really confident in you
01:33 - know your JavaScript skills or using you
01:37 - know frameworks JavaScript frameworks
01:40 - you might be a little bit more confident
01:43 - with your CSS skills so should be able
01:45 - to follow along a little bit better and
01:47 - I'll try to explain everything as I go
01:50 - along and explain the reason why I'm
01:54 - changing the styles and and how I'm
01:58 - doing it all right
02:10 - okay so I'm just getting my my other
02:13 - screens ready they gave everything ready
02:16 - so let's get started I'm gonna start
02:20 - this timer I have all of our tasks here
02:23 - that we're gonna work on so we're just
02:24 - gonna work our way down this to-do list
02:26 - and see how many we can get get finished
02:29 - and really this to-do list includes
02:33 - pretty much everything that we need to
02:35 - do to complete this project so this
02:36 - might be the last day that we're working
02:38 - on it
02:39 - we'll see you ever know for sure
02:42 - occasionally you run into some things
02:44 - that she didn't realize we're there or
02:50 - we didn't realize would be a problem I
02:56 - already see something I forgot forget to
03:12 - we're gonna make that logo larger all
03:14 - right let's start with that actually
03:17 - because that's right here at the top in
03:21 - the corner here so I usually like to
03:25 - kind of start with the header anyway and
03:29 - then work my way down so we'll probably
03:32 - start with this get this completed and
03:34 - then we'll work over to this side side
03:37 - nav here will complete the styles on
03:40 - that and then we'll finish up a few
03:41 - things that need done within the form
03:44 - itself okay so let's take a look then
03:47 - whoops in progress
03:50 - and let's take a look at what's going on
03:57 - here and why it's so small
04:00 - okay so we have a container div
04:15 - try to see what with where is it giving
04:19 - these let's just go down one and see
04:27 - okay it looks like it's getting these
04:30 - from here yep okay interesting so
04:36 - there's some media queries being used
04:37 - here that's defining the width of that
04:41 - icon and the height so let's move this
04:45 - around a bit and see what changes with
04:48 - these media queries okay they don't have
04:51 - any smaller yeah they do it just changed
04:54 - it yeah okay 768 pixels we change once
05:01 - we get down here the logo just there's a
05:06 - good set to display none I'm gonna think
05:09 - about changing that you probably should
05:16 - change that but for now let's let's
05:19 - stick to the task here let's change this
05:22 - first and so what we'll do is grab this
05:32 - we may as well keep this media query
05:36 - because maybe we will want a smaller
05:39 - logo on a smaller screen we'll see we it
05:44 - may be the case that we can just keep
05:45 - the same size on both screens but it'll
05:48 - save us a little bit of typing later on
05:50 - if we just bring that media query right
05:52 - over okay so let's see I'm gonna keep
06:01 - this with the nav but within that bar
06:03 - style so when I get down here I'm gonna
06:09 - make another section within here just
06:11 - just in in my comments and call this the
06:16 - interior nav
06:22 - let's so sentir your top nav because we
06:25 - do have a side nav and we don't once
06:38 - when you copy media queries from dev
06:40 - tools it doesn't get everything that you
06:42 - need so if you copy it over and it's not
06:47 - working it's probably because you don't
06:49 - have that other set of brackets so if
06:52 - you notice when I when I brought it in
06:55 - it just had the media query and it did
06:58 - not have these little curly brackets so
07:02 - I had to add them so if you've been
07:06 - working with dev tools I'm sure you've
07:07 - already encountered that but it might
07:09 - save you a little bit of frustration at
07:12 - some point why am i okay shoot I was
07:21 - editing directly the wrong file so let
07:25 - me copy this over I wondered what my
07:28 - indentation was like that and that's why
07:31 - it's wrong file so luckily we didn't
07:36 - change that much pretty easy to copy
07:37 - that over and so now that we I know we
07:42 - have that in there let's kind of mess
07:46 - with this now and then we can put in the
07:49 - new values when we get what we want here
07:53 - so I'm just going to change the width
07:56 - and let's do height:auto that's
08:05 - interesting
08:09 - very interesting okay 100% Wow
08:20 - okay we're gonna have to let's go with
08:26 - this then we'll select the heights
08:38 - interesting
08:49 - I am going to have to set I thought it
08:52 - was odd that they were setting both the
08:54 - width and the height like that evidently
08:56 - the way they have this set up you have
08:59 - to do it so let's let's try it okay
09:08 - actually that looks fine I just kind of
09:13 - guessed and figure you have to adjust
09:15 - this but I think that looks fine alright
09:20 - let's keep those those numbers then so
09:23 - we got 150 and 113 I forgot to mention
09:35 - the beginning I merged another pull
09:36 - request on our other project on our
09:38 - bulletin project that we were using
09:41 - react and graph QL doing some password
09:46 - lists log in through through email links
09:51 - so Harshad had another pull request and
09:54 - he implemented a print view I have a lot
09:58 - of people who are used to printing the
10:01 - bulletin from back in the days when it
10:03 - was just a Word document and they still
10:06 - want to print it so shortly after I
10:08 - launched the current version of the
10:10 - bulletin I decided to implement a
10:14 - printer-friendly view and so that's why
10:18 - we had this I really do want to keep it
10:20 - because I had several people ask very
10:25 - politely for it so thank you harsh it
10:29 - for implementing that view it looks
10:31 - great I issued about that just to add in
10:36 - a few things and fix some positioning
10:38 - things so I think we already have
10:39 - someone who's Whelan's here to to do
10:42 - that so thank you for that I can't
10:45 - remember the name off the top of my head
10:48 - but you know who you are if you're
10:49 - watching so I appreciate that
10:53 - okay that's not bad while we're here
10:55 - let's just check out well let's just go
10:59 - really big
11:02 - okay that works that works just kind of
11:06 - making sure we don't have a third media
11:09 - query and it looks like we don't so when
11:12 - we get down to here though I think I'd
11:15 - like to display the logo and that may
11:18 - require us to make this header a bit
11:21 - bigger I'm okay with that though I think
11:25 - it's important that we we still have
11:28 - some continuity with our branding even
11:31 - on the interior pages and I know that my
11:36 - bosses would agree about that so that's
11:40 - what we'll do
11:50 - I let's see if we need to set yeah all
11:55 - right well let's set our within our
11:57 - height like we did last time
12:07 - let's go with let's try 100 okay I guess
12:17 - we won't need to with this this time
12:19 - just the height so first thing I'm gonna
12:21 - try to make this small that's
12:25 - interesting
12:32 - alright we're gonna have to change the
12:34 - background sighs I could have typed that
12:42 - out faster then it took me a tab down
12:44 - there so we need to change the
12:46 - background size here whoops background
12:51 - sighs let's see interesting
13:04 - we are
13:13 - there we go it would just wasn't working
13:16 - because I was putting it on the wrong
13:17 - thing okay there we go this is what
13:24 - background has contained there we go
13:30 - okay so this is what we have here let's
13:37 - see that that small but that will be on
13:43 - a mobile device so I think it's you know
13:47 - potentially it's reasonable to have a
13:50 - smaller logo a user will have the device
13:55 - closer to their face than they would a
13:57 - computer screen or something like that I
14:01 - think that works I think we're gonna go
14:05 - with that and if we get some feedback
14:08 - that it needs to be bigger we can always
14:10 - do that but we'll go with this and then
14:11 - we won't even have to mess with the
14:13 - height okay that works so let's go let's
14:22 - just double check and make sure that we
14:26 - can put this height here and it still
14:27 - works and it does we're gonna grab these
14:31 - two let's just grab the whole thing here
14:38 - okay and we're still within our our top
14:43 - and a half here and let's put this here
14:48 - the media query below it you know what
14:53 - I'm gonna keep this here even though
14:56 - we'll be we already have it elsewhere
14:58 - because I just like to keep all of my
15:00 - custom styles in the same spot and then
15:03 - I can remove this from the area where I
15:07 - had this previously okay great so let's
15:16 - do a little test and copy these over
15:21 - and then we'll copy it over into
15:27 - Salesforce make sure that all our styles
15:33 - are being applied correctly
15:43 - okay
15:53 - oh okay and that is not being applied
15:56 - correctly
15:59 - that's all that's
16:10 - all right let's let's do a hard refresh
16:12 - here okay maybe I messed something up
16:19 - when I copy and paste of this okay
16:24 - that's that's there it's definitely
16:27 - there
16:33 - alright let's try it again then copy and
16:36 - paste and quicksave okay
16:44 - try it again
16:56 - alright let's inspect it should be this
17:05 - style tag yep
17:06 - alright let's go down to this place yeah
17:09 - actually so we do we have this we have
17:14 - these styles here why aren't they being
17:16 - applied target X header University icon
17:24 - um let's try this
17:32 - I'm not 100% sure this is the problem
17:35 - but it's worth a shot
17:51 - nope thought it might have been throwing
17:56 - an error okay well let's see let's see
18:03 - if the other one is being applied nope
18:08 - it's not interesting all right let me
18:16 - check the live chat in case you all saw
18:18 - something that that I didn't see oh no I
18:21 - forgot to start my timer I even moved it
18:23 - over here in the corner so you all can
18:24 - see it and I forgot we're gonna have to
18:27 - keep an eye on the clock but 218 right
18:29 - now let me set this 10-minute timer and
18:31 - that'll be right about the time when I
18:33 - started coding so thanks for for asking
18:38 - about that Harshit let me check hey
18:45 - everybody I see several of you were
18:46 - saying hello
19:00 - haha alright it says I now have 41
19:04 - commits in the bulletin you have 21 I
19:06 - know I know you've done quite a bit of
19:10 - work I am I told everyone and we had a
19:13 - department meeting yesterday and I told
19:15 - everyone that I you were doing a
19:18 - significant amount of the work for this
19:21 - bulletin and they were all impressed so
19:25 - so I'm not taking credit for your work
19:28 - making sure that that everyone here
19:31 - knows not just the work that Harsha does
19:33 - but the work that all of you do so I do
19:36 - not mind sharing credit at all okay
19:46 - Sebastian says I see some angular stuff
19:48 - there yeah there's some angular going on
19:50 - here
19:51 - so yeah this this is built with with
19:57 - angular oops it's not showing up
20:00 - properly when it's small yeah so let's
20:04 - see yeah so we've got angular here and
20:07 - jQuery the moment for the dates and then
20:10 - here's that Apex pages that's a
20:12 - Salesforce thing yeah speaking of
20:18 - angular we had a new video out this past
20:21 - week setting up an angular project so if
20:23 - you're interested in angular check that
20:25 - out I never really do any angular stuff
20:27 - so for any angular people that might be
20:30 - watching you can check that video out it
20:32 - it's one of just check the the last like
20:35 - several videos it'll be in there the
20:38 - title is really obvious but that's
20:45 - really cool cuz we didn't we didn't
20:47 - really have a lot of angular stuff going
20:48 - on until now shoot all right let's
20:54 - troubleshoot this hmm okay so I'm gonna
21:00 - check let me look in this style tag
21:03 - again to see if we've made any mistakes
21:10 - actually let me see this I believe is
21:13 - being applied correctly where's our a
21:17 - tag okay here so our a tag is being
21:20 - applied correctly I'm basically trying
21:24 - to see how far down the page is there an
21:27 - error
21:29 - [Music]
21:40 - hmm
21:50 - all right let's all right so that's way
21:53 - at the top yeah that's way way to talk
22:04 - I'm thinking did we miss I'm thinking we
22:09 - messed up our syntax somewhere but just
22:12 - it doesn't look like it these are all
22:14 - things we did yesterday that worked the
22:20 - only things that we've added but this
22:23 - year so
22:42 - I'm not 100% sure this is entirely
22:44 - necessary but I I see that almost always
22:50 - so MIT it's worth a shot I don't see how
22:53 - that could have messed up the previous
22:54 - code though the previous Stiles okay
23:02 - you know what let's let's inspect that
23:07 - element
23:30 - we're gonna have to expand this so I can
23:35 - get that okay so that's alright
23:52 - yeah in Hughes
24:18 - okay so that's already showing up in the
24:20 - page and it's at the bottom okay we've
24:24 - got some things overriding our styles so
24:28 - let's take that out completely or we can
24:37 - comment it up these are all commented
24:39 - out so that's fun
24:41 - okay so let's dig in to Salesforce a bit
24:43 - and find where this is is being put in
24:46 - and let's take it out let's see okay
24:53 - so let me think all right let's go into
25:03 - our our visualforce pages sorry this is
25:09 - so small I'll try to make it bigger the
25:11 - medium crease the font size okay we need
25:18 - action is that we may be able to get
25:21 - this quickly if I go back to the main
25:26 - page sometimes it'll show me what I've
25:33 - there we go
25:34 - default I think this is it yep yeah this
25:42 - is it - anyway it shows my recent item
25:46 - so luckily I had checked this page out
25:49 - recently enough that it was still here
25:52 - save me a lot of time looking for it
25:54 - okay wow that's so useful for custom CSS
25:59 - as sarcasm really I mean how can you put
26:05 - custom CSS and the box of the small I
26:08 - know you can resize it but the default
26:11 - should be like at least that big okay
26:15 - let's just comment this out
26:21 - the reason I'm commenting it out and not
26:24 - taking it out completely is that this
26:28 - this was put in here by the company
26:30 - that's doing this so target X is the
26:33 - company that made this application
26:38 - portion that works with Salesforce but
26:41 - then another company called Jenzabar is
26:43 - reselling that to my University so we
26:47 - don't work directly with target X we
26:49 - work with Jenzabar so the ghent the
26:53 - person at Jenzabar that's in charge of
26:55 - helping us left all this code here as a
26:58 - little helper
26:59 - so that I didn't have to look for where
27:01 - to do these things so that's why I'm
27:03 - leading it here in case I ever get stuck
27:06 - and don't know where to change something
27:08 - I can come back here and it's all you
27:10 - know has some helpful comments so that's
27:12 - why I'm keeping it like that otherwise I
27:14 - would just get rid of it okay all right
27:22 - now let's refresh and see what happens
27:37 - haha not expected at all
27:40 - okay I didn't think that would happen
27:42 - because I thought we yeah we are
27:45 - bringing in that background image here
27:51 - alright let's see maybe this is being
27:53 - inserted somewhere else further down the
27:55 - page as well interesting okay this is a
28:07 - good sign though no it's not that's the
28:10 - old stuff we're still not getting any of
28:12 - our newer stuff
28:25 - okay finally here we did get some of the
28:28 - new stuff here okay so you see it is
28:30 - being that's really odd okay we just
28:37 - need to get a little bit more specific
28:40 - with our style so I'm not gonna even
28:44 - look at these anymore let's just let's
28:45 - just do this I mean I don't really like
28:49 - doing this often but this isn't a usual
28:58 - situation where we have access to all
29:00 - the files and my timer just went off so
29:08 - I'm going to test this and no matter
29:10 - what happens we're just gonna answer
29:14 - some questions oh okay we have something
29:17 - all right great
29:22 - this is very slow to update I mean on
29:26 - how many people are gonna be moving this
29:28 - back and forth like that but okay I'm
29:36 - not exactly sure why this isn't working
29:38 - here oh you know we forgot to take out
29:40 - display:none as soon as we get back from
29:45 - the question/answer we got to remember
29:47 - display:none needs to be changed to
29:50 - display whatever we want we'll see which
29:54 - display works the best there okay short
30:00 - break and I'm gonna go through the live
30:03 - chat answer any questions that you've
30:05 - had so far then we'll do another
30:06 - 25-minute session we'll finish up with
30:09 - that header should be just one more
30:11 - thing needed for the change and let's
30:15 - mark down that we did spend so far one
30:22 - Pomodoro cycle on that okay let's see
30:29 - hard asks okay some gist jitan says
30:36 - can you read this yes I can read
30:38 - this so let me know if you have any
30:45 - other questions of more than happy to
30:46 - answer them and welcome I haven't seen
30:49 - you in the chat before so thanks for
30:51 - joining us so hard should I ask if
30:55 - there's any big work left in the
30:57 - bulletin project like authentication I
30:59 - might do that this weekend you know what
31:02 - hard should I I'll think I'll think
31:09 - about some stuff and maybe put some
31:11 - issues in and if I think about what I'm
31:12 - streaming I'll I'll say something maybe
31:16 - in the question and answer session at
31:18 - the end we can take a look at the site
31:20 - quickly and maybe go over some things
31:22 - and that way you or anybody else that
31:23 - wants to work on it over the weekend can
31:25 - do that I as I said before about that
31:29 - project I really want to tie it into the
31:33 - login system that we have at the
31:34 - University it's saml-based I just I need
31:41 - to get some information from the IT
31:43 - department I can't implement that I
31:46 - can't do anything from my end unless I
31:48 - get the right info so I'm still working
31:51 - on that info I do have a meeting and the
31:56 - head of the IT department and the
31:58 - second-in-command that the IT department
31:59 - will be there but it's not until
32:00 - November 7th it's about something else
32:03 - but I could definitely ask them if I
32:05 - haven't got the info by then I hope I
32:08 - get the info sooner than that but I
32:11 - don't have very much hope that you know
32:13 - it's it's 2:30 p.m. here on a Friday so
32:16 - I don't think I did very much done now
32:20 - if I especially after the stream
32:21 - everybody would probably be gone so
32:24 - probably next week I'll reach out to
32:27 - them again and maybe meet with some of
32:30 - them and talk about it so there is more
32:33 - authentication work that that needs to
32:35 - be done I hope but I don't really have
32:37 - enough info right now for us to get it
32:40 - to work or test it out or anything like
32:41 - that
32:55 - Harshit also asked what's the plan for
32:57 - deployment of the bulletin okay I don't
32:59 - have a date yet for deployment so yeah
33:04 - so in terms of a date there's no hard
33:05 - you know date for that when we do deploy
33:09 - we're going to deploy it just like we've
33:11 - done in some of the previous projects
33:13 - we're gonna have we're going to set up a
33:19 - droplet on digital ocean with Ubuntu
33:24 - we're obviously running node we're gonna
33:27 - run nginx as a reverse proxy we'll set
33:29 - up an ssl with that and probably it will
33:33 - end up being a bulletin Franciscan
33:35 - University and then we'll just set up a
33:38 - redirect for the current URL because the
33:40 - current URL is Franciscan University /
33:43 - bulletin but with the way we have things
33:45 - set up ladies I can't do that if we want
33:49 - to put this on digitalocean so we'll
33:51 - just set up a redirect for the current
33:54 - URL to redirect to the other one and yes
34:00 - I mean it's not really anything we
34:02 - haven't worked on before we don't need
34:04 - it to handle a really heavy load you
34:07 - know the university has around 500
34:09 - employees and so there's not really
34:13 - going to be that many people on this
34:15 - site at any one time so we should be
34:18 - able to just to run a five dollar
34:19 - droplet
34:34 - now I should said try important to
34:36 - override I know I try to avoid using
34:43 - important whenever I can though so it
34:44 - would it may be have saved some time and
34:46 - we may end up having to resort to that
34:48 - anyway but since in that case I could
34:51 - get rid of some code and I was going to
34:55 - get rid of that code anyway at some
34:57 - point I figured we may as well do that
35:00 - it makes everything look a lot cleaner
35:02 - in the end rooks said what is that a CSS
35:12 - CSS box for ants it needs to be at least
35:14 - three times bigger I know right
35:17 - it was crazy like maybe they just don't
35:21 - expect people to even use that and so
35:24 - they just made it small let's say I only
35:31 - have a few more comments left so I know
35:33 - my timers up but I'll just get through
35:34 - the rest of them inna says how was your
35:37 - day Jesse actually today wasn't bad
35:41 - actually if you all don't mind I mean
35:43 - let me tell you a story for two minutes
35:46 - here because I did have a little
35:48 - excitement today so I come into work and
35:54 - I'm working for a little while and then
35:57 - I get a call from my wife who says she
36:01 - was upstairs with with the two littlest
36:03 - ones with the baby and with my
36:05 - three-year-old and all of a sudden she
36:07 - heard the door alarm go off so I have a
36:10 - alarm on the house and even if the
36:11 - alarms not said it still makes a noise
36:13 - like a doorbell annoys when somebody
36:17 - opens the door and then a voice says
36:18 - which door was open so it said the
36:21 - basement door came open so she looked
36:23 - out the window to see if I was home
36:25 - didn't see my car got scared and took
36:28 - the kids and ran it across the street to
36:30 - the neighbor's house who I guess my wife
36:34 - has the code for their garage door
36:36 - opener because she takes care of their
36:38 - dog whenever they're away so she goes
36:40 - over the neighbors house and calls me
36:42 - I'm at work I'm saying well I don't know
36:47 - what to do I'll just
36:47 - come check it out so I drove home went
36:51 - through the whole house to make sure
36:52 - nobody was there nobody was there I
36:54 - think what happened is my wife just was
36:56 - holding the baby when she came in and
36:59 - did not close the door and you know just
37:02 - kind of it closed but it didn't latch
37:04 - all the way so the wind probably blew
37:06 - and blew it open but anyway uh-huh
37:09 - I had to go home and and protect my my
37:12 - family so but I did get to see the baby
37:17 - and my three-year-old and my wife so
37:20 - that was kind of cool I got to see them
37:22 - so anyway so that's how my day was so
37:27 - far and yeah not bad I've been a I wrote
37:34 - a gist that fixed what I think was an
37:38 - error in materialized CSS I wrote this a
37:41 - long time ago and I just just now the
37:46 - the maintainer czar their post we don't
37:48 - think that it's a problem they think
37:50 - that it's not a bug and it should be
37:52 - like that so anyway we disagree on that
37:55 - point but I still put my gist in the
37:57 - issue so that other people could use it
38:00 - if they were having the same problem so
38:03 - anyway I've been going back and forth
38:04 - with someone on there trying to help
38:06 - them to use that so that's kind of cool
38:08 - because I like I mean I took the time to
38:11 - put that on there so I'm really happy
38:12 - that somebody's actually using that
38:14 - although I do kind of wish they put it
38:16 - they merge it but I mean hey it's their
38:18 - repo they can run it however they want
38:21 - anyway thanks for being patient through
38:25 - my story let's get back to the code
38:30 - actually meet so harsh it says may I
38:32 - submit a pull request having sam'l
38:34 - boilerplate yeah definitely yeah I mean
38:37 - that'll that'll set us up that it'll be
38:39 - easier later on when we do get the info
38:41 - we need so yeah for sure
38:43 - I appreciate that
38:49 - Harshit says consider vulture comvee ult
38:53 - are calm it's cheaper than digitalocean
38:57 - okay has anybody use that website before
39:00 - V ult are calm let me know if you have
39:03 - and how you like it I just got to make
39:07 - sure that it's it's good quality since
39:09 - it's for the University I I got to be
39:13 - able to justify to the IT department
39:15 - while we're using this and is it safe
39:19 - and who else uses it and they're very
39:22 - security conscious so anyway as long as
39:27 - it's all cool and it checks out I'm
39:30 - definitely open to it but I mean for the
39:32 - university of five dollar droplet on
39:34 - digital ocean is not really a huge
39:36 - expense although I'm personally I'm more
39:41 - than happy to try it out for my side
39:44 - projects and things alright let's go
39:46 - back to this first things first where's
39:49 - that display:none get out of here
39:52 - alright okay cool so display:none was
39:59 - our problem let's get rid of that and
40:01 - say whoops what do we want to say let's
40:06 - see what it it's automatically going to
40:09 - hear display:block all right great
40:12 - we will set it to display block where we
40:16 - add
40:23 - oh right here very what my cursor is on
40:25 - what I'm thinking
40:28 - display:block all right I'm not even
40:32 - going to check that I'm almost positive
40:35 - that it's gonna work
40:38 - actually now I'm not I'm gonna check it
40:40 - now I don't remember before the the
40:44 - break exactly how much we we worked out
40:49 - in terms of the overrides
41:05 - it's okay looks like it worked wonderful
41:11 - alright let's move let's move this over
41:16 - to the done right we've already tested
41:19 - it now it's done I'm not gonna I'm not
41:23 - gonna change this amount of time we took
41:27 - since we only went over by a minute or
41:29 - so all right so next one fix button
41:33 - colors on the application of let's go
41:35 - for that all right and then let's put
41:44 - all these side nav ones on deck here and
41:47 - ready for dev saina saina saina
42:00 - okay
42:05 - so the button colors obviously are not
42:08 - what we want let's think about what
42:10 - color we want do we want to go with the
42:15 - yellow I think it's either going to be
42:21 - that yellow color or with a green color
42:29 - hmm I think I'll go with the yellow for
42:35 - now since we're already using it for the
42:36 - other buttons just for consistency and
42:38 - then we can always change it later if we
42:41 - if we feel like we need to forget X
42:46 - button header okay let's grab that class
42:49 - and as you can see I've been editing in
42:55 - this file so I think I think I'm just
42:58 - gonna edit in this file to take out one
43:00 - step from our flow here and then I don't
43:05 - know at the end of every day I can just
43:07 - copy it over here if we really want to
43:09 - keep a separate CSS file but I think it
43:11 - might be better to just keep all this in
43:13 - style tag in the head like we're doing
43:17 - since that's the way we're building it
43:19 - and testing it then it's most likely to
43:22 - be reliable like this I'm afraid if we
43:24 - move it into an external CSS file and
43:27 - then bring it in it it'll get overridden
43:32 - by a lot of other styles and we'll have
43:34 - a mess
43:36 - okay where mine is my button styles
43:46 - that's not it
43:49 - I think they're down here there we go
43:54 - button styles let's add this in oops
44:01 - and we're gonna add it in here as well
44:19 - all right
44:24 - so that should do it
44:32 - let me make this a bit smaller
44:44 - whoa
44:52 - interesting
44:55 - all right so that didn't work probably
45:00 - let's see I'm guessing that the styles
45:13 - interesting
45:38 - all right are they have going on here
45:55 - all right let's I think we're gonna have
46:04 - to use important here so it looks like
46:09 - the hover is working so that is turning
46:13 - a different color but we're gonna have
46:17 - to use important for the non hover State
46:23 - so so important on our color and on our
46:34 - background color if you're not familiar
46:37 - with important important overrides
46:41 - everything in CSS so even in line styles
46:46 - so if you really need something to apply
46:48 - use that but use it sparingly because
46:51 - you'll never be able to change this it
46:53 - totally breaks the cascading nature of
46:56 - cascading style sheets so normally you
47:00 - want the cascading yeah so that's why I
47:04 - try not to use it because it makes
47:06 - things difficult later on to change but
47:12 - sometimes you have to do it and in this
47:14 - case I don't think we have another
47:18 - option unless we want to take a lot of
47:21 - time to try to find out where all this
47:24 - markup is coming from and change that
47:26 - and I don't think it's that important to
47:31 - take that much time
47:38 - okay interesting so we still have some
47:42 - things that aren't being applied
47:51 - we still have that weird effect which I
47:55 - definitely want to get rid of we have
48:03 - this is that supposed to be a shadow or
48:06 - a border that's weird
48:10 - let's see where that's coming from
48:12 - oh my goodness it's a blue box shadow
48:17 - wow I've never seen anything like that
48:24 - that's a weird shadow too I mean aside
48:28 - from the color it's just really odd
48:31 - anyway okay so we're gonna have to get
48:37 - rid of that box shadow why is it not Oh
48:59 - where is this being pulled in from
49:06 - grid framework I got to see where on the
49:10 - page this is coming in it
49:20 - no just no finding this
49:28 - for some reason the search is not
49:31 - working come on
49:40 - actually you know what I think it's
49:41 - searching there we go
49:55 - interesting it must be being pulled in
50:00 - some other way
50:08 - alright let's find all our style tags
50:17 - six-six style tags you gotta be kidding
50:19 - me
50:20 - alright there's nothing in that one this
50:22 - one's above ours we need to look for
50:24 - ones that are below our style tags so
50:29 - I'm sorry
50:30 - that's a script tag now that's weird so
50:42 - we have our head tag here and then we
50:44 - have our body but then within our body
50:46 - we have a bunch of meta stuff and more
50:49 - tags ah that's a mess okay so we've got
50:57 - our first one our second one third one
51:00 - is ours the fourth one
51:17 - okay so I don't think we're dealing with
51:20 - any of these yet but it's good to know
51:23 - it's there now we should have one more
51:27 - and we already commented all this out
51:36 - that's really odd let me check the live
51:39 - chat here and see if you all saw
51:41 - anything that I didn't yeah hard
51:51 - you're right it is a source map that's
51:53 - why I started to look in here manually
51:59 - because I thought well here's what I
52:02 - thought of one that it is a source map
52:04 - because it had the dot less at the end
52:06 - right but I thought even if it's being
52:12 - pulled in anywhere on this page as as a
52:15 - link it shouldn't be overriding what
52:19 - we're doing so maybe somehow they're
52:22 - pulling it in and putting it inside a
52:24 - style tag but we can see that's not the
52:27 - case we just went through every style
52:28 - tag so yeah let's do that
52:31 - let me see I'm not I never use source
52:36 - Maps so I need to figure out where I can
52:39 - turn this off at
52:53 - I said I want this there we go
52:58 - okay all right source maps are off now
53:03 - hopefully we'll be able to see where
53:05 - this is really coming from whenever I
53:11 - work on projects like this that are old
53:13 - projects that I need to do things with
53:16 - it feels like I'm a detective
53:18 - it's like a puzzle like I'm trying to
53:20 - figure out where the things are it's
53:28 - kind of fun when it works out not so fun
53:31 - when you spend hours trying to figure
53:32 - out something but so far we haven't
53:35 - really spent that much time trying to
53:37 - figure anything out where was that
53:39 - button header there's our button right
53:45 - all right let's scroll down no all right
53:50 - let's refresh because it's still showing
53:52 - me the less file
53:58 - what's it's still showing less files
54:13 - no no still gotta be kidding me
54:17 - all right let me look
54:48 - all right
54:56 - hard good good IRS it yeah okay I'm
55:03 - so glad you saw that I turned off
55:06 - JavaScript source Maps not CSS source
55:09 - maps so thank you for catching that hard
55:14 -  I would have been searching for a
55:17 - long time in vain okay cool
55:21 - now let's let's give it a refresh whoa
55:28 - let's go back here
55:36 - and let's see where this is coming from
55:42 - okay these are our styles
55:57 - where is this coming from
56:06 - I guess these aren't ourselves these are
56:10 - ours okay I was mistaken these are ours
56:14 - these are the ones that are overriding
56:16 - ours and they are in a style tag we just
56:18 - missed them though they're not what this
56:25 - is so weird
56:29 - this should not be overriding our Styles
56:32 - our styles are down here right I thought
56:40 - they were I guess not
57:14 - all right let's go back here oops not
57:18 - well it'll be easier to see here okay
57:39 - better nav nav or
58:13 - I
58:18 - I really hate to do this because
58:19 - obviously you don't want to put style
58:22 - tags in the middle here but I think this
58:24 - is the only way that we're gonna be sure
58:26 - that we're overriding a lot of stuff so
58:28 - here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna move
58:29 - our style tag down here if I put our
58:32 - style tag right here above the nav we
58:36 - might have a shot at having it be above
58:40 - I'd rather not have to put it inside the
58:42 - nav but if I do I will just it's just
58:46 - gonna look terrible inside than that but
58:47 - anyway I think we'll do it now the
58:52 - reason I I'm gonna do this even though I
58:54 - wouldn't normally put a style tag in
58:56 - here is because the way that the
58:57 - document is being put together the style
59:00 - tags are already all messed up you have
59:02 - multiple places throughout where there
59:05 - are style tags so I don't have control
59:07 - over that I can't change that so I
59:10 - shouldn't be too worried about it
59:12 - okay let's change this and hopefully
59:18 - this will solve our problem there we go
59:24 - we can leave our link tag up here that's
59:26 - fine now let's bring this in save it
59:35 - copy it and alright now let's see what's
59:44 - going on
59:53 - it's how is it worse no what is going on
60:16 - okay
60:20 - but none of my styles here now I am us a
60:26 - copy and paste wrong right that's insane
60:37 - no that's
61:02 - okay there's our font dashboard so I get
61:07 - it you I already check that the style
61:13 - and these are not it right here's the
61:17 - one that we wanted to get below here's
61:23 - our header we should be inside that
61:43 - hmm
61:45 - all right for some reason it doesn't
61:48 - like it that we put that style in here
61:54 - let's move it somewhere else
62:07 - all right I'm gonna try it in here
62:17 - if this doesn't work I may just have to
62:19 - throw some more importance in there wow
62:26 - did I copy this over or not now I can't
62:31 - even remember and let's make sure we do
62:38 - a hard refresh
63:06 - style oops gonna check the style tags
63:11 - yeah we're missing one see before we had
63:13 - six and now we have five so that style
63:16 - tag that we're trying to move around
63:17 - will not work if we put it down lower in
63:21 - here
63:30 - so
63:32 - potentially we could put CSS down at the
63:37 - bottom here we have this portion here
63:41 - that's being added it would work I know
63:43 - where I need to put this but I'm
63:46 - hesitant it already is taking so long
63:51 - for the styles to actually get applied
63:53 - I'd rather not add to that time at all
63:57 - by moving on the further down the page
64:29 - hmm all right let's
64:37 - let's move it back to where we know it
64:39 - works first of all
65:04 - all right so you got ourselves back
65:07 - that'll be a good place to start from
65:10 - let's do another question and answer
65:14 - sessions I'm gonna set my my five minute
65:20 - timer right now but I'm still I'm trying
65:23 - to fit decide whether or not I want to
65:24 - do another Pomodoro session of keep
65:30 - looking the wrong spot of CSS so I'm not
65:34 - not hundred percent sure this one's
65:38 - taking way longer than anticipated and I
65:43 - know I estimated one but I thought it
65:44 - would be before one okay let me scroll
65:52 - up a bit and it's actually not a lot in
65:57 - the live chat so oops maybe we will do
66:03 - some more some more coding
66:14 - nan says that styling tags are a mess
66:18 - yes is they
66:31 - Harshit a switch mouse and keyboard I
66:33 - use I use the what do they call it the
66:37 - magic trackpad or something like that so
66:40 - the Apple trackpad thing that you can
66:45 - get with with Macs
66:47 - so that's what I use the gestures are
66:52 - nice so it was really weird to get used
66:55 - to coding with this at first but I've
66:58 - been using it for about a year and a
67:00 - half mount and it's just really fast to
67:04 - like swipe between screens you know and
67:07 - do things like that so I've gotten used
67:13 - to it
67:17 - does anybody else use a trackpad when
67:20 - they're coding or is it you know mainly
67:21 - use use a mouse and my keyboard is just
67:24 - it's nothing special the keyboard is
67:27 - just the basic Apple keyboard so I mean
67:34 - it it has the number pad on it that's
67:37 - the really special thing so I've been
67:43 - one to try out one of these mechanical
67:45 - keyboards that I see everybody talks
67:49 - about how awesome they are so I want to
67:55 - try it out they're kind of expensive and
67:59 - a lot of them look really cool so maybe
68:04 - uh maybe I'll try it out I'll try one
68:09 - out one day
68:14 - Harshit said i mostly use keyboard for
68:16 - us all stuff yeah I've heard that that
68:20 - that ends up being a lot faster horses I
68:23 - rarely touched them off yeah that would
68:30 - be a lot faster I've heard especially
68:34 - people that use them they like never
68:37 - need to touch the mouse they can do
68:39 - everything from the keyboard so that's
68:41 - cool I can see the benefits of that for
68:48 - now this this works for me I'd have to
68:50 - make like a deliberate effort to try to
68:53 - switch up how I do with the so if I
68:57 - think it'll really help speed up my my
69:00 - dev process here then I'm willing to try
69:02 - something else but for now this works
69:05 - for me like I said I probably I'd like
69:09 - to try out a new keyboard but we'll see
69:14 - I'll just maybe have to wait and see if
69:16 - one's on sale and it's it's good quality
69:18 - I really like I've seen some keyboards
69:25 - that look like they're from a typewriter
69:27 - so they look really old-school I think
69:30 - that looks cool I would I would want to
69:35 - try that or try to make that or
69:37 - something
69:40 - rook says hi is that how the screen
69:43 - sometimes slide halfway across yeah
69:45 - that's I do the little slide thing so it
69:50 - is cool and that's one thing like when I
69:54 - had a mouse I used to do this with the
69:56 - keyboard I think you can do like control
69:58 - and then the number keys but one thing
70:01 - you can't do with that is you can't
70:03 - slide halfway across and check what's
70:05 - going on here so like there's you don't
70:08 - have as much control with the keyboard
70:11 - for things like this sometimes you like
70:16 - I don't need like I don't need to go
70:19 - completely up here I just need to peek
70:21 - really quick and see what's behind
70:23 - something so
70:26 - it's not it's not a huge difference but
70:30 - it makes a little bit of difference
70:35 - Sahil says Trello does help yeah
70:38 - definitely Sal says I mean for one
70:41 - person on a single project Oh does
70:43 - Trello help sorry I misread that first
70:45 - one it's a question the question is does
70:47 - Trello help for one person on a single
70:49 - project yeah definitely Trello is very
70:52 - helpful so this is how I set up all my
70:54 - Trello boards for for projects that I'm
70:57 - doing this is the the Kanban style I do
71:01 - add this column here you don't
71:03 - technically need all these columns for
71:06 - for Kanban but this is I like to set it
71:08 - up and how I learned to do it it's very
71:12 - helpful for me to keep track of
71:14 - everything I can easily at a glance see
71:16 - how much more I have left in my project
71:19 - how much I've done it's a very nice
71:21 - visual reminder once this done section
71:25 - gets really long it's it's cool because
71:28 - you just get the feeling like I've done
71:31 - all this work it's a sense of
71:32 - accomplishment even though you haven't
71:34 - finished the project yet you can still
71:36 - see all the work that you put into it
71:40 - so I recommend this even if you're the
71:44 - only person on the project it'll keep
71:46 - you on track and it gives you a nice
71:50 - record you know in addition to your
71:53 - commit history and things like that but
71:56 - this gives you a nice record and it
71:58 - helps me you know I can i can put to-do
72:01 - lists in here I can put attachments if I
72:05 - wanted to I could I could allow somebody
72:08 - else to see this even if they're not
72:10 - working on the project maybe like let's
72:13 - say somebody who's handling the
72:14 - photography or the content for the site
72:18 - maybe able to put their stuff in here so
72:20 - even if they're not a developer still be
72:25 - useful so anyway I really like this and
72:30 - I imagine if you had more than one
72:32 - person this would be even more useful so
72:36 - that
72:36 - anybody could automatically see what's
72:39 - going on with the project and if
72:41 - somebody's working on something or not
72:44 - so I like it
72:50 - it helps me but you have to you just
72:55 - have to be consistent and use it
72:57 - occasionally I'll have a project where I
72:59 - just quit using the board and then
73:02 - obviously there's you know there's no
73:04 - benefit to it let's see Harshit says you
73:11 - can annoy people with them meaning the
73:14 - mechanical keyboard especially the
73:16 - Cherry MX red switches okay that's what
73:20 - that's what I wondered so if any of you
73:23 - have experience with a mechanical
73:24 - keyboard let me know so I guess I have
73:27 - two questions one is the noise really
73:31 - that bad now I work in an office by
73:34 - myself I have walls the ceiling a door
73:37 - so it's probably not the noise issue
73:40 - won't be a problem when I work at home I
73:44 - usually work in the basement so probably
73:47 - not a problem either but I mean is it so
73:51 - loud that I would hear it over my
73:53 - headphones and it would annoy I would
73:55 - annoy me myself right that's my first
74:00 - question number two if I was to get one
74:03 - what are the best kinds of switches
74:05 - because I hear like all these different
74:07 - colors for switches which ones are the
74:11 - best
74:15 - okay so I'll let everybody answer that
74:17 - and I'll move on here Brian asks how are
74:19 - you peaking you mean this so hold on a
74:25 - sec I'll show you
74:30 - okay all right this will be easier to
74:33 - see so I move three fingers across like
74:39 - like this you can't see it on my other
74:42 - screen because someone I'm a couple
74:44 - screens over so I just move three
74:48 - fingers and then I can peek so you need
74:53 - a trackpad I think you can do it on the
74:55 - Magic Mouse as well because you can do
74:58 - touch gestures on the mouse
75:03 - hello okay the expose gesture that's
75:06 - three fingers straight up so this one
75:09 - just move them straight up
75:25 - okay Robert says read drag red dragon
75:30 - mechanical keyboard is what I use it's
75:33 - only $39 I replaced my Corsair with the
75:36 - red dragon okay that's that's a pretty
75:39 - reasonable price compared to what I've
75:41 - seen for for other mechanical keyboards
75:44 - so so Robert so would you would you
75:49 - recommend it is it does it give you a
75:52 - better experience when you're typing is
75:54 - it a noticeable difference or you know
75:57 - is it worth it all right rook says the
76:04 - Cherry MX blue or the clicky
76:06 - tactile ones okay oh man Sahil says that
76:12 - once made a Trello board for my friends
76:14 - for university project but no one even
76:16 - bothered I know how that is I tried to
76:18 - get other people that work here to use
76:20 - Trello for things before nd use like
76:25 - Google sheets and edit things you know
76:28 - on the Google sheet instead of emailing
76:31 - something back and forth or worse
76:32 - printing it out and just sending it to
76:35 - people we've actually had people burn
76:41 - files on CDs to share them and this is
76:43 - within the last two years so the
76:46 - situation is I totally understand the
76:49 - situation of trying to get people to use
76:51 - some technology that will make things go
76:54 - faster and be more productive and then
76:57 - nobody wants to to use it like I'm gonna
77:02 - make my my face smaller because it just
77:08 - feel weird I'll leave it a little bit
77:10 - bigger since I'm talking and not coding
77:13 - but I was looking at my the the video
77:17 - feed and just not used to me being the
77:21 - focus
77:27 - okay so Robert says there they are noisy
77:31 - so that use a logitech wave at work
77:34 - Harshit says some coders do not use
77:36 - mechanical keyboards on their YouTube
77:38 - bits and livestream oh that you know
77:40 - what that's a good idea actually I
77:42 - didn't even think about that but so it
77:45 - would probably be good then to have a
77:46 - either a backup keyboard at work or just
77:48 - not use it at work and you should use
77:51 - the if I'm going to use mechanical
77:54 - keyboard maybe just use it at home
77:57 - Carson says the Cherry MX brown are the
78:00 - best okay cool so what what makes the
78:04 - brown the best sorry for all the
78:06 - questions about that I'm sure I could
78:08 - look this up on my own but I think it's
78:10 - cool to get advice from from you all
78:15 - especially if you have experience with
78:16 - them
78:30 - all right rook says for mechanical
78:32 - switches go to stores that have them and
78:34 - fake type away really the best luck
78:37 - that's a great idea this is just this
78:41 - kind of goes to show like how much
78:42 - Amazon has changed the way I think it
78:45 - never occurred to me that I could go to
78:47 - an actual store and type on a keyboard
78:51 - before I bought it
78:52 - in my mind I'm just thinking like I'm
78:55 - just gonna buy this off of Amazon like I
79:00 - the only store I ever actually go to in
79:03 - person is the grocery store that's
79:05 - that's it I buy everything else from
79:08 - Amazon okay Harshit says that corsair
79:17 - mechanical keyboard costs $170 whew
79:21 - that's more than I'd like to spend on a
79:23 - keyboard especially if I already have
79:24 - one that that is sufficient I would
79:27 - definitely have to have significant
79:29 - proof that that keyboard would be much
79:32 - better for me oh okay so I guess Harshit
79:39 - saying that now Windows has the same
79:41 - gestures that's awesome before I am I
79:45 - downloaded some some program that let me
79:48 - use gestures on Windows and it wasn't as
79:51 - good as the Mac but that's really cool
79:54 - that they have them natively
79:58 - okay so hard should ask which one do I
80:01 - find better github or Trello for a
80:05 - github projects or Trello I'm gonna tell
80:07 - you right now if I had to pick right now
80:09 - I'd pick Trello but I'll only use github
80:14 - projects just for the last what like
80:17 - week or two so I don't think I've really
80:20 - given it a fair shot so maybe in a
80:24 - couple of weeks I'd have a better
80:26 - opinion if I really force myself to use
80:28 - get up projects I think if I found a way
80:34 - on github projects to actually track my
80:39 - my Pomodoro cycles
80:43 - then I would probably like it a lot more
80:45 - so I either need to find something that
80:48 - does it in a very similar way or better
80:50 - way that I could do it on Trello or make
80:53 - something so this is just a chrome
80:59 - plug-in that does this right now so
81:02 - potentially I could just make a plug-in
81:04 - that would do the same thing but for
81:07 - github pages so if I really start I'm
81:13 - sorry not github pages github projects
81:15 - if I really start to like get up
81:18 - projects maybe I'll make try to make
81:22 - something like that
81:23 - I don't know otherwise I'm going to go
81:27 - I'm going to probably use both and I
81:31 - it's really nice though that it's
81:34 - integrated everything with github is
81:35 - integrated so it's right there on the
81:37 - repo it's convenient for people who come
81:41 - to the github repo and want to
81:44 - contribute to the project and not have
81:45 - to go somewhere else
81:47 - so I like that we'll see I really want
81:51 - github projects to work and be the thing
81:54 - that I can use so I'm gonna give it I'm
81:56 - gonna give it some time and and try it
82:01 - out a little bit more
82:07 - okay harsh it says for the keyboards
82:09 - switches the mechanism feels different
82:12 - for each okay the MX browns are still
82:17 - tactile but quieter than the blues okay
82:20 - now our suit says it's personal
82:21 - preference all right
82:24 - Robert says I think it's worth it
82:26 - because I like the tactical feedback I
82:28 - did not want to pay a hundred dollars to
82:30 - replace Mike or Sarah so I went with the
82:32 - red dragon and it works just as good as
82:35 - the Corsair okay cool so what oh yeah
82:43 - that was going to be my next question
82:45 - and you've already answered it so
82:47 - awesome Robert says the red dragon has
82:50 - fake red switches so I'm assuming
82:52 - they're they're not the the Cherry MX
82:55 - brown switches then they're there
82:59 - there's some type of off-brand okay
83:11 - all right cool you know what actually
83:14 - maybe that might be a good way to start
83:16 - out just to get a cheaper one even
83:17 - though it's not like the best switches
83:19 - that everybody says you need and then at
83:22 - least I can get an idea of whether I
83:24 - even like that and then maybe maybe if I
83:34 - really like it then I can justify paying
83:37 - more money for the for the chariot brand
83:42 - switches it could be a work expense I
83:50 - might be able to deduct that from my
83:52 - taxes that is another cool thing when
83:59 - you freelance be sure depending on your
84:02 - tax laws where you're from you can save
84:06 - money on your taxes by making sure that
84:09 - you deduct all work expenses which can
84:12 - include if you work out of your house
84:13 - part of your internet bill potentially
84:18 - even part of your rent if you have a
84:20 - dedicated working space you know bills
84:24 - for your computer for all your your
84:29 - servers you know if you're getting like
84:32 - digitalocean AWS something like that
84:34 - so another I didn't talk about that when
84:38 - we talk about freelancing before but
84:39 - you're gonna have to deal with taxes if
84:42 - you freelance unless you pay somebody
84:43 - else to do it
84:50 - okay so brooke says the patent expired
84:52 - on the cherry MX switches so now a lot
84:58 - of other manufacturers are making them
85:01 - okay that's kind of cool so potentially
85:04 - they could be close to the same quality
85:08 - that's interesting I think it's worth a
85:11 - shot then I don't know if I'll get it
85:14 - anytime soon I got Christmas coming up
85:16 - so I got a save up some money and buy
85:21 - presents for all the kids and everybody
85:23 - so maybe after that I'll be looking to
85:26 - get get a keyboard all right well I'm to
85:33 - the bottom of the live chat we've been
85:35 - streaming for about an hour and a half
85:37 - now so I think I think I'm not gonna do
85:41 - any more coding it's probably obvious at
85:44 - this point you know on this stream right
85:46 - now I'll probably be able to do a little
85:50 - bit more work on this before I leave
85:53 - today and I'm gonna do some digging
85:57 - around in Salesforce because that's kind
85:59 - of boring for you all to watch I'm gonna
86:01 - do some digging around and see how much
86:03 - I can actually edit of this and maybe we
86:09 - can we can get this looking a little bit
86:11 - nicer and sort it out so because it's
86:13 - it's kind of a mess and the mark-up is
86:16 - just it's weird so oh okay sorry how
86:21 - should I almost forgot so harsh it's
86:23 - reminding me that to bring up the
86:25 - bulletin and plan that out all right
86:27 - totally forgot really glad you reminded
86:30 - me all right so I have the bulletin up
86:33 - right here all right let's see so all
86:41 - right so aside from the what we already
86:46 - discussed at the beginning of the stream
86:47 - about the sam'l authentication stuff
86:56 - here's what we still need I see they
87:00 - make a search this way the search is
87:03 - probably
87:03 - the biggest most complicated thing that
87:05 - we need right now so the search I'd like
87:09 - to have it be a live search so when you
87:13 - type I mean we definitely want to
87:15 - debounce it so it doesn't or throttle it
87:18 - so that it doesn't come up with it
87:23 - doesn't send like a million requests but
87:28 - we're gonna have to hit that graph QL
87:30 - endpoint to get what we need so yeah so
87:42 - that's what we're gonna do
87:42 - we'll need some type of live search
87:44 - feature as a model this live search is
87:50 - gonna function almost exactly like the
87:54 - way we did it on project one so I guess
88:02 - yeah it's gonna function like that
88:05 - Harshit says there is already data in
88:07 - there yeah well here's the thing of this
88:11 - there's a lot of posts so if we can
88:15 - bring in all of the posts that are in
88:19 - WordPress then that's fine if we just
88:24 - filter what we have but do we really
88:29 - want to pull all those posts every time
88:36 - somebody comes to the site because
88:39 - normally people are just going to see a
88:40 - small fraction of the total available
88:42 - posts so I guess it's going to be a
88:46 - trade-off is do we want to keep it
88:48 - really light and only pull in some of
88:51 - the posts that people are likely to want
88:53 - to see and then just make another call
88:56 - when they go to search or do we want to
89:01 - pull in everything all the time so I
89:06 - don't know I don't know what would be
89:08 - better but either way we need to be able
89:14 - to get
89:17 - have you user type something in and then
89:21 - automatically have these cards pop up so
89:25 - it would be like basically once they
89:27 - type in three characters or more if they
89:30 - stopped for I don't know 400
89:33 - milliseconds after typing then it runs a
89:36 - search something like that so anyway
89:45 - that's their what I'd like to have
89:48 - happen is if you click search it just
89:51 - extends it either can do one of two
89:53 - things you can just extend out a search
89:55 - box here obviously it needs to be like
89:58 - the material design style or it can
90:02 - change out this entire thing and make it
90:05 - one big search with an X over here and a
90:09 - search button over here when you click
90:12 - the button and that's another thing it
90:14 - needs to happen on first button click it
90:16 - needs to open up the search and then the
90:19 - search thing needs to remain here or
90:21 - slide over and then you need to be able
90:24 - to click on that to initiate a search
90:26 - once you've typed in what you want
90:28 - obviously a live search is it's going to
90:33 - be an option there and it's going to
90:34 - automatically come up but the live
90:38 - search is only going to happen if you
90:40 - search for something that's three or
90:42 - more characters on the off chance that
90:44 - somebody's I've sent two characters and
90:46 - wants to search for that they need to
90:47 - hit the search button which why would
90:49 - you ever search for some those two
90:51 - characters but you never know maybe it's
90:53 - two really weird characters okay so
90:58 - that's the search like I said if you
91:01 - check out that project one the
91:03 - catechetical Institute page it's Caddick
91:05 - etics com I guess we should bring it up
91:10 - right now so we did this on the
91:15 - resources page we have the search if you
91:19 - see I can type that in and right nothing
91:22 - comes up
91:27 - so anyway so that's where you'd look for
91:35 - for that let's see I don't think we're
91:39 - actually going to do classic mode the
91:45 - help page we're not going to do that yet
91:48 - because I think oh that the current help
91:50 - page is based on the current site so it
91:53 - has some tutorial videos and things on
91:54 - there I'm going to redo all that because
91:56 - we're not going to have the same issues
91:58 - that we have with the old site so we'll
92:02 - hold off on that until we're close to
92:04 - being finished the filter by date so as
92:09 - long as a user needs to be able to pick
92:12 - either a month in a year and we just get
92:16 - all the posts from that particular month
92:17 - or if we want to we can allow them to
92:20 - pick a date range so down to the day and
92:25 - they can pick a date range so either one
92:28 - of those are fine
92:29 - probably the month year thing will be
92:32 - the easiest and then the current
92:35 - bulletins needs to only get the bulletin
92:38 - items for the past week I already have
92:41 - some logic in the current bulletins
92:43 - project so I'll probably share that
92:44 - logic with you all sometime next week
92:46 - and see if we can just recycle that and
92:48 - apply it to what we're doing here it's
92:51 - it's a little weird and kind of specific
92:54 - to our situation so just I guess hold
92:56 - off on that and until we can look at
92:59 - what we're doing now and see if that'll
93:01 - work if we need to to make it better so
93:06 - anyway that's kind of the plan I think
93:10 - that covers the biggest things and yeah
93:17 - I mean I'll be doing a lot of little
93:18 - adjustments here and there to make
93:22 - things look nicer or make the text more
93:24 - readable and things like that you know
93:29 - just small small adjustments
93:33 - so cool okay let's see okay heart should
93:42 - say an Apollo 2 came out interesting I
93:45 - should said it's crab Redux should we
93:49 - migrate oh man
93:51 - I don't know I'm I'm not mice I'm not
93:58 - necessarily interested in migrating this
94:00 - project right now since we're already in
94:02 - the middle of it but I'm open to
94:06 - suggestions if you all think that I
94:08 - really should migrate it we can think
94:11 - about it if any of you want to attempt
94:14 - to migrate it that's that's totally fine
94:18 - with me if that's something that you
94:19 - would like to do and like to try to do
94:23 - but I'm happy to just leave it as is for
94:26 - this project and then migrate maybe the
94:29 - next time we use it we'll use the the
94:32 - newest version okay all right now I am
94:42 - at the bottom of the live chat and I'm
94:44 - really gonna in this time what's today
94:49 - Friday alright it's Friday so I hope you
94:54 - all have a nice weekend
94:57 - I'll be back Monday and hopefully you
95:02 - all I'd like to see what you all do over
