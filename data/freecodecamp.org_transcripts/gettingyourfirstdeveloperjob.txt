00:00 - hi everyone my name is christine and i'm
00:05 - a front-end web developer
00:07 - i actually just started programming six
00:10 - months ago and i found my first
00:13 - dev job about three months so now i've
00:15 - been a web developer for about
00:17 - three to four months now and i really
00:20 - love it
00:21 - so
00:22 - this talk i'm just gonna give a little
00:24 - background
00:25 - about myself and my interest in coding
00:29 - and also
00:30 - how what i did to
00:32 - land my first
00:33 - job
00:36 - so i graduated from the university of
00:39 - oklahoma about four years ago with the
00:42 - political science degree and i didn't
00:44 - really know what exactly to do with a
00:46 - political science degree i was confused
00:49 - and lost
00:50 - and
00:51 - so
00:51 - i decided that
00:53 - i wanted to be a lawyer or
00:56 - be a makeup artist be other different
00:58 - things i had so many different hobbies
01:00 - that i wanted to do
01:02 - and i contemplated thought about it and
01:04 - i realized that those are the type of
01:06 - jobs that i might not be interested in
01:08 - the long run
01:10 - and so i got into
01:12 - coding when i landed my first job in the
01:15 - marketing
01:17 - field and i worked with html templates
01:20 - in wysiwyg and a lot of the stuff that i
01:22 - did before was mainly just
01:26 - coding uh the tables inside the wysiwyg
01:29 - very simple stuff
01:31 - and
01:32 - i realized that i wanted to do more in
01:33 - life i didn't want to stay at my old job
01:36 - because
01:37 - you know i just feel like i would
01:38 - plateau quickly
01:40 - so i looked around for different types
01:43 - of classes i looked into getting a
01:45 - computer science degree but i realized
01:48 - that you don't really need a computer
01:49 - science degree to do web development
01:52 - and i really like web development
01:53 - because i like art and design so i feel
01:56 - like that would be something i'm good at
02:00 - so i looked around online for some
02:02 - classes
02:04 - and a lot of the classes were really
02:05 - expensive one class to learn javascript
02:07 - was about two grand that i saw
02:10 - and so i was like you know i feel like i
02:12 - could find something else you know maybe
02:14 - try different routes some other classes
02:16 - that may be cheaper
02:18 - and then i saw ok coders which is where
02:20 - i met carson he was one of my
02:23 - instructors at ok coders and had helped
02:25 - me a lot throughout my journey so i just
02:28 - want to say thank you carson very very
02:29 - much
02:31 - but uh so i found ok coders and it's
02:34 - basically a six month
02:37 - module or six modules six months long
02:40 - bootcamp class every saturday
02:42 - and you learn everything about web
02:44 - development starting with beginning with
02:46 - html css
02:47 - you learn how to use your command line
02:50 - you learn how to use your github where
02:52 - you push all your files
02:54 - and
02:55 - into github and then also
02:57 - javascript libraries which is really
02:59 - really important if you're looking to be
03:02 - a front-end developer
03:05 - so yeah
03:06 - i attended bootcamp for about six months
03:09 - and a lot of the work i had to code i
03:12 - have to practice coding every single day
03:15 - and get better
03:16 - the classes were only four hours long
03:19 - every week and i knew
03:20 - that you have to put
03:23 - extra work
03:24 - into
03:25 - um
03:26 - you have to put in the extra work
03:28 - outside of class
03:30 - so
03:31 - you know i studied a lot i
03:34 - read all my documentation that's
03:36 - probably the most important thing is
03:38 - reading your documentation starting out
03:41 - and that's what i did i use all my
03:43 - online resources i practice on
03:45 - codeacademy udemy
03:48 - lynda.com those are great if you want to
03:50 - get into coding those are great online
03:53 - resources to take and practice on
03:57 - i also asked a lot of help from people i
04:00 - joined teclahoma met a lot of the great
04:02 - developers in the community
04:04 - and just getting advice from people or
04:07 - people who have experience in this type
04:09 - of career really helped me
04:12 - love being a developer even more
04:14 - the excitement of
04:16 - you know seeing people creating
04:18 - so many cool
04:20 - uh things
04:22 - it's just sorry i got nervous but
04:24 - creating a lot of cool things is just
04:26 - amazing and and i think that's why we
04:28 - all want to be developers is that we
04:30 - want to create something and build
04:31 - something of our own
04:33 - and so um anyways i practice a lot and
04:37 - then i was also looking for a job at the
04:39 - same time knowing that i'm probably not
04:41 - qualified
04:43 - but i gave it a shot anyways i just kept
04:45 - trying and
04:47 - i attended job fairs
04:49 - and brushed up my resume
04:52 - i created a portfolio
04:54 - i created a lot of side projects and
04:56 - pushed everything to my github to show
04:59 - that i put in a lot of work
05:01 - even if i know my code wasn't that great
05:03 - i just
05:04 - pushed everything
05:06 - into my github and then
05:09 - finally got my first dev job
05:12 - at a marketing company who's willing to
05:14 - take this opportunity
05:16 - opportunity on me even though they know
05:18 - that i'm probably i'm still really new
05:20 - and not
05:22 - fully qualified um i got the job and
05:26 - i was really excited
05:29 - got a little
05:30 - content and about two weeks ago i
05:33 - actually almost lost my job
05:36 - because i wasn't practicing
05:38 - enough outside of work and that's the
05:41 - most important things that i want to
05:42 - tell you guys starting out as a
05:44 - developer if you have not much or no
05:46 - prior program experience you have to
05:50 - practice even when you get the job you
05:52 - have to practice outside work
05:54 - and i just i got to continue i was too
05:57 - happy and i relaxed and then
06:00 - you know i was in a very tough spot
06:03 - where they said that i need to improve
06:05 - or it just won't work out
06:08 - and i was given two weeks to show
06:11 - improvement at my job
06:13 - and i did it
06:14 - and
06:18 - it was
06:19 - very
06:20 - it was a lot of work um i just whatever
06:23 - i did at work i showed them and i had
06:27 - better communication with my senior
06:29 - developers that's also one important
06:32 - thing that you guys have to know is
06:33 - communication with your fellow
06:35 - developers
06:36 - that was one thing that i didn't do very
06:38 - well i i was the type of person that i
06:41 - wanted to learn everything my front-end
06:43 - skills weren't even that great and i
06:45 - wanted to learn to do php and sql and
06:47 - all the backend
06:49 - and i took in work that i don't even
06:52 - know what i was coding they gave me php
06:55 - and sql and i'm just sitting here trying
06:56 - to figure it out when i realized that
06:59 - sometimes you have to say no when you're
07:01 - not ready for something you have to say
07:03 - no
07:04 - and so i was honest to them and said hey
07:06 - i'm i'm not ready for this yet
07:08 - and i need to practice on my front-end
07:10 - skills and that's what i did
07:13 - so
07:14 - when you get your new job when you get
07:15 - your developer job make sure you are
07:18 - fluent with all your languages before
07:20 - jumping into something else
07:22 - for me i just
07:24 - i just wanted to learn everything i
07:26 - couldn't say no because
07:28 - i was scared to say no i wanted
07:30 - i wanted to learn everything and be good
07:32 - at everything and sometimes you know
07:36 - it's you have to take it one step at a
07:38 - time i thought being a developer means
07:40 - you have to know you know react you have
07:42 - to know angular even though at my job we
07:45 - use jquery like i wanted to learn react
07:48 - and angular i want to do all these
07:49 - things but i know i have to take it one
07:52 - step at a time and that's the important
07:54 - thing
07:55 - another thing is besides that
07:59 - is getting feedback from your senior
08:02 - devs and
08:03 - you know just your fellow developers
08:05 - that you're working with especially when
08:06 - you're new getting feedback is great
08:08 - knowing your work process like how
08:11 - you're doing always ask them like how am
08:13 - i doing do you think i'm doing okay
08:15 - because i know everyone has their own
08:17 - different techniques
08:18 - so it's best to just have a good
08:20 - communication and getting feedback
08:23 - from your peers
08:25 - and another one is never stop practicing
08:29 - always keep learning i'm still in the
08:31 - learning process right now i mean a
08:33 - couple weeks ago i
08:36 - was here trying to debug a bootstrap
08:38 - carousel and i felt embarrassed
08:41 - debugging a bootstrap carousel because
08:43 - i'm like well this is so simple like why
08:46 - can't i get it but i learned that it's
08:48 - still a learning process for me i'm
08:50 - still i'm still learning i'm still
08:52 - continuing to grow and sometimes it's
08:54 - okay to ask for help even something so
08:57 - simple like bootstrap carousel or
08:59 - learning how to use bootstrap it's
09:01 - never embarrassing to ask questions
09:03 - because you actually learn from asking
09:05 - questions just don't ask the same
09:07 - questions over and over ask and absorb
09:09 - that's the most important thing
09:12 - but yeah and then another thing is oh
09:15 - yeah this is probably important too but
09:17 - try to use the same ides as your fellow
09:20 - developers i know we all have
09:22 - you know a preference that we use like i
09:24 - like visual studio code um that's just
09:27 - my preference but i know like at my job
09:29 - and stuff we use php storm or like adam
09:33 - and stuff like that i just think it's
09:35 - you don't you don't have to do it but i
09:38 - think it helps with the workflow and the
09:39 - process when you use the same ide as
09:41 - your fellow peers
09:43 - that usually helps a lot
09:46 - and then another tip is
09:49 - when you get your first project it's
09:51 - always good to whiteboard it out draw a
09:54 - map of how you're going to build your
09:56 - website you know have an idea before you
09:59 - actually start coding
10:01 - that was my mistake too is i didn't
10:03 - really have an idea
10:04 - and so i kind of just start coding
10:06 - random things when you have to wipe word
10:08 - it out you have to talk to your boss
10:10 - don't try to take initiative with
10:12 - anything
10:13 - not well don't try to take initiative
10:15 - with everything
10:17 - beside and not letting your fellow
10:19 - developers know always always try to
10:22 - wipe board it out
10:24 - and then another thing is um biddle law
10:27 - side projects
10:29 - if you have anything you're interested
10:30 - in building do it after work hours you
10:33 - know take the weekend off don't go out
10:35 - with your friends like if you have to
10:38 - improve you have to just start
10:40 - practicing more and more build something
10:41 - cool like i want to eventually build an
10:43 - app but i don't know what happened yet
10:45 - but
10:46 - um another thing is don't be afraid to
10:49 - try new things um code something
10:51 - different don't code the same thing over
10:53 - and over
10:54 - right now since i'm still pretty new i
10:56 - am practicing on building my jquery maps
11:00 - i built a couple maps before
11:02 - and
11:03 - but i'm still practicing i'm
11:05 - not that great with the map i'm learning
11:07 - how to style maps with javascript so
11:10 - build something new try something new at
11:12 - least every single week and you'll get
11:14 - better and just learn that way
11:19 - let's see what else
11:35 - okay but yeah it's um so that's
11:39 - all i really have with the tips and
11:42 - advice
11:43 - and my story is just really practicing
11:46 - using your online resources
11:49 - talk to your peers
11:50 - also have good communication with your
11:52 - boss
11:54 - when finding a job push yourself out
11:56 - there join organizations that's what i
11:59 - did you know i joined teclahoma i joined
12:01 - free code camp i talked with my
12:03 - instructors that's the most important
12:05 - thing it's just communicating with
12:07 - fellow developers
12:08 - that could give you really good advice
12:10 - and also
12:11 - don't take criticism
12:13 - as an insult always take criticism as
12:16 - something you can prove and learn from
12:18 - and that's
12:20 - the most important thing is um
12:22 - and then
12:24 - yeah getting
12:25 - feedback positive side projects
12:29 - draw a map
12:32 - yeah that's
12:34 - really all that i have i know it's kind
12:36 - of short but if anyone has any questions
12:40 - or yeah
12:43 - well my interview was actually very
12:46 - short
12:47 - i didn't really take a test or anything
12:48 - i know some companies require you to
12:50 - take a test i actually
12:52 - took a test a couple weeks before that
12:55 - with an hr recruiter when i was trying
12:56 - to find a job
12:58 - just testing my javascript
13:00 - and i did alright on that but they
13:02 - didn't hire me on
13:04 - another company
13:06 - saw that i was very motivated to learn
13:09 - and try new things and also they liked
13:12 - the fact that at my previous job i wore
13:14 - many hats like i did all the digital
13:16 - content at my job and
13:19 - i was lucky enough because the company i
13:20 - work for really needed someone
13:23 - and so i got the job as a web developer
13:29 - yeah
13:30 - and that's
13:31 - i just told them my experience and
13:33 - everything gave him my portfolio
13:36 - and then yeah
13:37 - from there
13:45 - the most useful thing that i did was
13:47 - mainly
13:49 - reading my documentation
13:51 - in the beginning
13:53 - i can't i can't say this enough but
13:56 - reading your documentation is so so
13:58 - important that's what i spent my time
14:00 - doing
14:02 - outside of work now is just reading
14:04 - through everything carefully and even
14:07 - though i was in boot camp class i missed
14:08 - like the little things here and there
14:10 - because i was trying to
14:12 - code out my portfolio but even when i
14:15 - coded out it still wasn't it wasn't good
14:17 - i did a lot of
14:19 - what i did
14:20 - was i would always inspect right click
14:23 - inspect in my console and then just go
14:25 - in there in a debug but when you
14:26 - actually read your documentation clearly
14:29 - and thoroughly it really helps you to
14:31 - understand
14:32 - what you're doing a lot more so i can
14:34 - just code it out now fluently rather
14:36 - than having to inspect all the time
14:39 - and so i did that and then
14:41 - just practice a lot online outside of
14:44 - work
14:45 - that was probably the most useful things
14:46 - that i did as a developer
14:51 - yes
15:04 - well it's like so like on bootstrap
15:06 - saying
15:07 - you know it gives you all the elements
15:08 - and stuff so they have um your columns
15:11 - how to build bootstrap columns um how to
15:14 - do responsive media queries and stuff
15:17 - like that when you really read it
15:18 - through it helps you understand how to
15:20 - build
15:22 - your columns on your web page when i
15:24 - started out i didn't know that
15:26 - in every div container there are 12
15:29 - columns
15:30 - and
15:31 - reading that part made me understand
15:34 - that now instead of having to inspect my
15:35 - element every time i know that if i were
15:38 - to build two comps it's just
15:40 - automatically column md6 column md6
15:43 - and so forth so it's like reading your
15:45 - documentation really helps you
15:47 - understand that and also
15:49 - once you get your html css and
15:52 - those skills down it'll help you
15:54 - understand javascript more because
15:56 - you'll learn how to use dom elements and
15:58 - that's the key thing
16:00 - so yeah really read your documentation
16:03 - man
16:06 - anybody else
16:13 - yeah well now eight months
16:15 - because i've been in my job for about
16:17 - three and a half months now
16:19 - but i got actually got my first job at
16:22 - my last module
16:24 - coders bootcamp class so
16:26 - yeah
16:28 - yes
16:35 - you just have to show
16:38 - oh
16:42 - i'm sorry sorry can you say it
16:45 - oh okay
16:46 - sorry
16:54 - okay so he said that when you're a new
16:57 - developer what does your company expect
17:00 - out of you when you first started versus
17:03 - three months in
17:04 - so when you first started they want you
17:06 - to get to get familiar with their
17:09 - process of working
17:11 - and also how they you know just really
17:14 - focus on their software um i'm not sure
17:16 - how other jobs are but i know my company
17:19 - we use a software where we import all
17:22 - our code codes in and the software was
17:24 - built by our
17:26 - lead senior developer
17:28 - and so that's the main thing is when you
17:30 - first started out is learning how to use
17:32 - the software where to place your header
17:34 - code where to place the footer where do
17:36 - you place your link tags and everything
17:38 - in that where do you place your
17:39 - javascript that's the most important
17:41 - thing and then further down the line
17:44 - progress is
17:46 - you know they expect to see progress
17:48 - from you you know stop
17:50 - putting in-line styles in your html
17:52 - start using css morse start writing
17:55 - multiple css to make the codes short and
17:58 - clean
17:59 - and so from it's just really
18:01 - building more and more experience seeing
18:03 - um not more experience i'm sorry uh just
18:06 - seeing progress
18:09 - yeah
18:10 - yes
18:17 - uh someone from twitch said what
18:19 - frameworks in javascript you would like
18:22 - to use um so i'm really into react um i
18:26 - want to get to learn react more
18:29 - that's something i want to eventually do
18:32 - but hopefully react in angular something
18:34 - i'm interested
18:36 - once i get my jquery down
18:39 - yeah
18:40 - thanks
18:44 - anybody else
18:48 - oh okay yes
18:57 - he said what skill set did i learn from
19:00 - star space 40
19:01 - teclahoma star space 46 is the
19:04 - organization that i could apply to my
19:07 - job um honestly it's how to start out
19:09 - and find a job like how to connect i got
19:11 - a lot of advice from kimberly too she's
19:14 - great she's great

19:25 - too
19:26 - and building my resume always link your
19:30 - github you know your portfolio on top of
19:32 - your resume so that people can see that
19:34 - the first thing that was something i did
19:36 - that on my resume but i linked my
19:38 - portfolio in the back and you don't want
19:40 - to do that smart to do in the front so
19:42 - that everybody could see
19:44 - um and a lot is just like you know help
19:47 - like debug learning how to use my
19:48 - console that's what i learned
19:50 - and yeah
