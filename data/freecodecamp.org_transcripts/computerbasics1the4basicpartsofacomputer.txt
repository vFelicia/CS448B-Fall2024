00:00 - Hi, I'm Briana from freeCodeCamp
00:02 - and today we're going to talk 
about the basics of computer hardware.
00:05 - Computers are made up 
of four basic parts:
00:07 - The Input/Output, CPU, 
and Memory.
00:11 - The Input is what you're 
putting into the computer.
00:14 - Think about mouse, keyboard, 
microphone,
00:18 - any way you're getting 
data into the computer.
00:20 - The Output is what you're 
watching on your monitor
00:23 - or listening to on 
your speakers.
00:25 - These can both be any format 
like text, numbers,
00:29 - videos, images, what-have-you. 
It doesn't matter.
00:32 - The CPU stands for 
Central Processing Unit
00:35 - and that's what we all think of 
when we think of a computer.
00:38 - It's what does the functions.
00:39 - It's what runs the software.
00:41 - It manipulates the data.
00:43 - The Memory is where we 
store data and information.
00:46 - Now the CPU has exclusive 
access to this memory.
00:49 - You can't get to the Memory 
from the Input
00:51 - or from the Output 
without the use of the CPU.
00:54 - So just to review we've got 
four basic parts of a computer:
00:58 - the Input/Output, 
CPU, and Memory.
