00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30
00:02 - days today is day number 10 and we are
00:04 - going to be
00:05 - creating
00:07 - a pricing table you know when you
00:09 - download software or purchase a product
00:12 - and there are different tiers of options
00:15 - that you can purchase of that specific
00:16 - product or service
00:18 - well we're going to create one of those
00:20 - pricing tables in css3 so let's jump in
00:24 - here and see what the final result looks
00:26 - like so here we have a basic pricing
00:29 - table we have two options we have basic
00:31 - and awesome we have the title of the the
00:34 - card here and then we have the price
00:37 - and then we have the
00:39 - you could see uh alternating backgrounds
00:41 - we got a darker gray and then the basic
00:43 - color darker gray and then the
00:46 - call to action button so these outline
00:48 - the features and the benefits of the
00:49 - specific product
00:51 - and then we have the awesome package
00:52 - which includes more and it's just
00:55 - the reason why this one is bigger and
00:57 - has a larger
00:59 - card and it stands out more is because
01:01 - you kind of want your customers to lean
01:03 - towards that option make it so that both
01:06 - options are available but one of them
01:09 - stands out you'll see it often when you
01:11 - purchase a product and it says this is
01:13 - the most popular option
01:15 - so they want to highlight it so that all
01:17 - three options aren't just monotonous and
01:19 - there's a little bit of difference in
01:20 - the pattern so it's a pattern disrupt
01:22 - and it lets you
01:24 - focus on one or the other specifically
01:26 - the one that is um
01:29 - better
01:30 - so we're going to create that up here in
01:32 - the sandbox you can see it's just some
01:34 - basic text so we're going to turn this
01:36 - basic text
01:37 - into something really pretty with css3
01:41 - so if we jump over into our sandbox you
01:44 - can see here we have 10 pricing table if
01:46 - the code editor looks different to you
01:48 - i'm using brackets right now adam wasn't
01:50 - playing atom atom wasn't playing very
01:53 - nicely with me
01:55 - when i was recording this lesson so i'm
01:56 - switching over to my second favorite
01:57 - code editor which is brackets
02:00 - and it's also free you can download
02:02 - brackets if you like brackets
02:04 - so 10 pricing table make sure you
02:06 - download that in the lesson folder that
02:08 - will be available
02:10 - to go ahead and download that 10 pricing
02:12 - table and then open up your sandbox.css
02:15 - for your styling if you want to look at
02:17 - your index.html you can see how the
02:19 - pricing table works out
02:21 - it's just a series of divs
02:23 - uh
02:24 - wrapping within each other nested within
02:26 - each other the
02:27 - naming convention pricing table we have
02:30 - pricing block
02:31 - header pricing heading the pricing price
02:35 - and then the currency value duration if
02:37 - i were to scroll down to the final
02:38 - version this might help you see it a
02:41 - little bit better
02:43 - so for example we have the pricing price
02:46 - the the
02:47 - currency the value the duration
02:50 - right here the pricing body
02:53 - the un
02:54 - unordered list and then we have the
02:56 - pricing footer which includes the select
02:58 - button
03:00 - and and that's all that's how that works
03:03 - so that's the html very straightforward
03:06 - jump into your sandbox and we're going
03:08 - to start coding this up right away so
03:11 - let's start with
03:12 - the class of pricing dash table
03:17 - and that's going to be margin
03:19 - 60 pixels
03:20 - auto
03:24 - let's go ahead and select pricing dash
03:26 - table
03:29 - excuse me after pseudo class
03:31 - pseudoelement
03:33 - display
03:35 - table
03:38 - content
03:39 - and empty string
03:41 - and clear
03:44 - both
03:47 - okay let's continue on we're going to
03:49 - select the pricing
03:51 - dash table
03:53 - and here we're going to use a child
03:55 - selector
03:57 - so this basically selects divs where the
03:59 - parent is
04:00 - all divs where the parent is the pricing
04:03 - table
04:05 - so that is that selector
04:07 - and we're going to say display block
04:10 - we're going to float that left
04:12 - we're going to give it a width of 48
04:17 - minimum height of one pixel so it
04:19 - doesn't collapse on itself
04:21 - uh background color whoops white that's
04:24 - triple f and then color triple five save
04:28 - that in your browser here you'll see
04:30 - that it's starting to look a little bit
04:31 - like something
04:33 - uh it's everything's floating each of
04:35 - these tables or these divs within the
04:37 - pricing table are floated and the
04:39 - background here is that is white so it
04:41 - stands out in contrast
04:44 - on everything else here
04:46 - let's carry on pricing dash table
04:49 - child selector div and then the
04:51 - colon not selector
04:54 - so basically this means
04:56 - a div that is not and then you can give
04:59 - uh you can pass in some information here
05:02 - to let it know what it is not so let's
05:04 - let's break this down we're going to say
05:05 - not
05:06 - last
05:07 - child so this says
05:09 - select the pricing table
05:11 - uh any children that are a div of the
05:14 - pricing table but not
05:16 - the last child this could be an id or a
05:19 - class but we're going to specifically
05:21 - choose
05:23 - not last child
05:26 - because we don't want the last child to
05:27 - have this style
05:29 - a nice little css3 trick there
05:31 - margin
05:33 - right is going to be two percent so on
05:36 - all those divs but not the last child so
05:38 - really not the second element
05:42 - now we're going to say pricing dash
05:44 - block
05:45 - we're selecting that specifically
05:49 - and we're going to say
05:50 - text align center
05:53 - border radius let's do five and then
05:56 - overflow
05:57 - hidden
06:00 - now let's save this you can see it's
06:01 - starting to come together we're starting
06:02 - to get some basic shapes here
06:05 - excuse me if i do this random little
06:07 - cough here and there just getting over a
06:09 - cold so i'm trying my best to suppress
06:10 - it anyway uh basic and awesome you can
06:13 - see that the white and they got the
06:15 - the margin here and the round border
06:18 - radius looking pretty good
06:21 - let's go back here
06:22 - and now we're going to select the
06:24 - pricing dash header
06:26 - the height will be auto
06:30 - padding
06:31 - 30 pixels 20 pixels 40 pixels
06:36 - text transform will be uppercase
06:40 - and save that let's keep going there's
06:42 - nothing really that nice to look at
06:44 - quite yet
06:47 - now we're going to select the pricing
06:50 - header
06:52 - and then a descendant
06:53 - will be pricing dash heading
06:58 - so in that we're specifically selecting
07:01 - if you look here in the browser
07:03 - we're specifically selecting the pricing
07:05 - header pricing heading so this is the
07:07 - header itself
07:08 - as you can see
07:10 - but then we're specifically selecting
07:11 - the header within that
07:13 - heading
07:15 - so basic and awesome is what we're
07:17 - selecting and we're going to say font
07:18 - size let's do 1.4
07:21 - rem
07:22 - relative to the root font size and then
07:26 - font weight is going to be
07:28 - let's say bolt
07:31 - okay
07:32 - let's carry on
07:35 - let's select the pricing price
07:38 - and that is going to be
07:40 - the color of triple seven
07:45 - and then we're going to select pricing
07:46 - price
07:48 - child selector
07:49 - span
07:52 - we're going to say display
07:53 - inline block if you go over here to the
07:56 - browser pricing price is the entire
07:58 - element itself
08:00 - pricing price span is each of the
08:04 - elements within that so the dollar sign
08:06 - the the the dollar value and the slash
08:10 - month
08:11 - text
08:12 - we want that to be inline block so we
08:14 - can specifically
08:15 - uh manipulate those
08:17 - items those elements so now we're going
08:20 - to go pricing dash price double
08:22 - underscore currency now we're going to
08:24 - say margin top 10 pixels and below that
08:27 - we're going to say vertical align top
08:31 - font size
08:34 - to rim
08:36 - font weight
08:37 - bold
08:39 - line heights just one so we can keep
08:41 - everything nice and lined up nice and
08:44 - tight opacity 0.6
08:47 - 0.6
08:50 - okay
08:52 - let's move on we don't need to look over
08:54 - at that right now
08:56 - after currency let's do the pricing dash
09:00 - price double underscore value
09:02 - so that is the numeric value font size
09:05 - nice and big
09:06 - five ram
09:07 - font weight
09:10 - um let's do bold i like bold
09:14 - really highlight that price
09:16 - and line height
09:18 - one there we go so now head over to the
09:21 - browser
09:23 - and check this out i'm going to remove
09:24 - line height and show you what just
09:25 - happened this is what it was before
09:28 - uh without the line height just the
09:30 - basic default uh
09:32 - baked in line height for the browser but
09:34 - if i add line height one it's lining
09:36 - that up nice and that's what we want
09:39 - okay now head back here into your code
09:41 - editor i'm going to code up pricing dash
09:44 - price double underscore duration so this
09:46 - is the duration of that price because
09:48 - it's a monthly payment plan
09:51 - or a subscription in this ma in this
09:53 - example
09:54 - we're going to say margin top
09:57 - i'm going to go
09:58 - 10 pixels as well vertical align top
10:02 - now head over to your browser i'm going
10:03 - to show you what just happened there
10:05 - this is vertical align top if i remove
10:06 - vertical align top
10:09 - that's what happened but if i add
10:10 - vertical line top it pops up there and
10:12 - that's what we want we want that to be
10:13 - up at the top
10:14 - near the currency
10:16 - just looks nice
10:18 - font size 1.4
10:23 - rim
10:24 - line height again one to make everything
10:26 - nice and lined up and opacity for this
10:29 - one as well 0.6
10:32 - cool so that is the price head over to
10:34 - your browser and check it out
10:36 - that looks nice
10:38 - and tidy
10:40 - the pricing and the title so let's move
10:42 - down to the benefits and the features
10:44 - here
10:45 - the body of the actual price
10:48 - pricing table so now we're going to say
10:49 - pricing dash
10:51 - body
10:52 - and the
10:53 - unordered list
10:55 - and that's going to be a list style of
10:57 - none
10:59 - just to remove that option margin 0
11:03 - padding 0
11:05 - save that keep going down we're going to
11:07 - say pricing dash body
11:10 - uli
11:12 - we're gonna go
11:14 - display block
11:16 - padding 10 on the top and bottom 20 on
11:18 - the left and right
11:20 - beauty and then margin zero
11:25 - okay
11:26 - now we still got more to do let's go
11:28 - down below that and we're going to say
11:31 - pricing dash body uli and then we're
11:34 - going to select the nth child and then 2
11:37 - n that means every second
11:41 - child element
11:44 - and we're going to style every second
11:46 - one
11:47 - like so now check this out head over to
11:49 - the browser this is what's nice about
11:50 - brackets when you're doing the live
11:52 - preview you click on the selector and it
11:54 - actually highlights what you're
11:55 - selecting so you can see in real time
11:57 - what's happening and i like this so i
11:58 - can show you how this actually affects
12:01 - the nth child 2n selector look how it's
12:04 - selecting every second child so in the
12:06 - basic element there's only one second
12:09 - child whereas in the awesome pricing
12:12 - table there are two so it does the every
12:14 - second element and if there were more it
12:16 - would keep going so it's a nice way of
12:18 - dynamically selecting something a nice
12:20 - css3 trick
12:22 - background color
12:25 - we're going to make that white
12:28 - every second one
12:29 - and then what we're going to do check
12:31 - this out pricing dash body
12:34 - we're going to select uli and child
12:36 - again
12:37 - but what we're going to add here is 2n
12:40 - plus 1. now watch this if we head over
12:43 - to our browser watch what this does
12:46 - so now watch what this is doing it's now
12:48 - it's selecting essentially
12:50 - 1 3 five so it's selecting the you know
12:53 - instead of every second it's doing every
12:55 - second plus one so that includes the
12:57 - first one the third one the fifth one
12:59 - the seven and so on and so forth
13:02 - now we wanna do is give that a
13:03 - background color
13:04 - of we're going to say f8f8f8
13:08 - just slightly darker a little bit more
13:11 - shading
13:12 - now if we save that check it out in the
13:14 - browser it's very subtle but it's a nice
13:15 - way of giving some visual reference to
13:19 - each line especially if you want to
13:20 - compare
13:21 - primary feature primary feature these
13:24 - benefits these bonuses you know and then
13:26 - so on and so forth it's a nice way of
13:29 - outlining that
13:30 - okay now we're almost done we're going
13:32 - to jump down into our pricing
13:35 - footer
13:37 - nice and simple we're going to say
13:39 - padding 40 pixels 0 0
13:42 - give it some space let's move on
13:47 - we're gonna style up our pricing
13:51 - button
13:53 - uh comma that we're gonna say pricing
13:56 - button and then the link
13:59 - and then another comma we're gonna say
14:00 - pricing dash button
14:03 - and then visited
14:06 - okay and in there let's style it up like
14:07 - so display block padding 20 pixels all
14:11 - around
14:12 - text
14:13 - decoration none because it's a link and
14:15 - we don't want that
14:16 - that style text transform uppercase make
14:19 - that nice and uppercase
14:22 - background color we're going to say
14:26 - triple three kind of that dark gray
14:29 - and then color
14:31 - white
14:32 - all right so check that out in the
14:34 - browser both of them look the same now
14:36 - we've got our basic style but now what
14:38 - we need to do is uh style that popular
14:40 - version the more popular one the the
14:43 - awesome one as we called it
14:46 - so it's the class in html is pricing
14:50 - dash popular so the popular option
14:53 - and we're going to say this one
14:55 - has
14:57 - margin top negative 20 pixels we're
14:59 - going to bump it up a little bit
15:01 - to give a little bit of an offset
15:04 - and now we're going to say
15:05 - pricing
15:07 - dash
15:09 - popular
15:11 - and then we're going to do descendant
15:12 - selector and say pricing
15:15 - dash header
15:17 - and we're going to style that by saying
15:19 - padding top 50 pixels we're going to
15:22 - give that more
15:24 - breathing room the reason why we're
15:26 - doing that is check this out pop over
15:27 - into the browser if i remove this
15:29 - padding top
15:30 - because we have this offset it's up here
15:32 - 10 pixels now we can't compare
15:35 - and contrast each of the benefits
15:37 - they're actually offset but if i give
15:38 - this some more space i want this primary
15:41 - feature to line up with this primary
15:42 - feature so by adding our padding top do
15:44 - you see what happens now it's perfectly
15:46 - lined up so now if we keep adding
15:49 - benefits on either of these packages
15:52 - those are going to line up and so that's
15:53 - a little trick to do that just some
15:55 - basic measurements and basic math
15:58 - all right back in our code editor here
16:00 - we're going to go pricing dash popular
16:02 - we're selecting that the whole time here
16:03 - now and then pricing dash footer
16:06 - now we're just doing things to make it
16:07 - look a little different padding top 60
16:10 - pixels on this one as well just more
16:13 - breathing room
16:16 - and then now we're going to do is we're
16:17 - going to go pricing popular
16:19 - pricing dash price
16:22 - the color of that price i want it to be
16:24 - something that stands out
16:25 - ff
16:26 - 888 so it's gonna be like a salmon color
16:31 - and the
16:33 - uh we're gonna jump down below that
16:35 - we're going to say
16:37 - pricing
16:39 - popular
16:41 - pricing
16:42 - [Music]
16:43 - dash button
16:45 - and that's going to be background color
16:47 - we're going to use that salmon color
16:48 - again
16:49 - ff8888
16:51 - and the color we're going to say
16:54 - white
16:55 - is the text of that button itself
16:58 - and now we want to be able to
17:00 - have a hover state for that button so
17:03 - pricing dash
17:04 - popular
17:07 - and then pricing
17:09 - button and the hover state and that's
17:12 - going to be
17:13 - color
17:14 - we're going to go
17:16 - ff 8888 and then the background so
17:19 - that's the text color will be that but
17:21 - the background let's use the same
17:24 - order
17:26 - background will be
17:28 - triple three the same as the default
17:30 - button state but the color will flip of
17:32 - the text color
17:34 - okay now save this
17:36 - check it out
17:38 - both of them now essentially are done
17:40 - but if i change if i try and make these
17:43 - responsive they don't look very good as
17:45 - you can see especially as you start to
17:46 - get into like a
17:48 - iphone size
17:49 - so we want to fix that
17:52 - by doing some basic media queries here
17:54 - what we're going to do
17:56 - is i'm going to say media
17:58 - screen and
18:00 - max width
18:02 - uh 1023 kind of like a
18:05 - tablet
18:07 - and i'm going to style this up by saying
18:08 - pricing table
18:12 - is going to be
18:15 - margin
18:16 - auto
18:18 - let's keep going
18:20 - pricing table
18:22 - child selector div so all divs that have
18:25 - a parent of pricing table
18:27 - float none we want to remove that float
18:29 - and we want the width to span the entire
18:31 - container so 100 percent
18:33 - below that we got pricing dash table
18:36 - child selector div not
18:39 - last child so we're just going through
18:40 - and re-selecting what we just styled up
18:44 - in our css3
18:46 - i'm going to say margin right
18:49 - and we're going to remove that and the
18:50 - margin bottom we're going to say 20
18:53 - pixels because now they're going to
18:54 - stack and we want 20 pixels of space in
18:56 - between the two
18:58 - so that is going to be good let's keep
19:01 - going
19:02 - we're going to say pricing body
19:04 - we're going to say max dash width 100
19:08 - overflow hidden sorry
19:11 - white space
19:14 - no wrap so let's see what this looks
19:15 - like so far let's make this 10 23
19:18 - roughly here
19:20 - there we go so you can see now it stacks
19:23 - and now looking here
19:25 - at the basic one there's supposed to be
19:26 - some space here
19:28 - there's 20 pixels of margin at the
19:30 - bottom of this top pricing table but
19:32 - it's not actually pushing it down and
19:33 - that's because this
19:34 - awesome
19:37 - element
19:38 - it has negative top margin so we're
19:40 - going to solve that here go back to our
19:43 - code editor and we're just going to say
19:44 - margin bottom
19:46 - 40 pixels and that's basically just
19:48 - going to give it another 20 pixels we
19:50 - could have also said that the the
19:52 - popular option doesn't have a margin top
19:54 - and
19:55 - in fact why don't we just do that we'll
19:56 - say margin bottom 20 pixels but we're
19:59 - going to specifically select
20:02 - it's going to come up here but we'll
20:03 - just
20:04 - jump in and add that style
20:06 - it's going to be pricing dash popular
20:10 - and that's going to be
20:14 - margin top 0. that'll solve the problem
20:17 - there we go
20:18 - let's get back to what we're doing here
20:19 - with the pricing body so after pricing
20:22 - body we're going to do a couple do a
20:23 - couple more things really quick
20:25 - and then we're going to call that a
20:27 - lesson so pricing body uli
20:32 - display inline block
20:36 - and then we're going to say
20:38 - vertical align middle
20:43 - and then we're going to go pricing
20:45 - dash body
20:47 - ul
20:49 - li not
20:51 - first child
20:54 - and that is going to allow us to say
20:56 - margin
20:57 - left
20:58 - negative 5 pixels what we're trying to
21:00 - do here is you might be wondering why
21:02 - are these stacking sideways like that we
21:04 - want them to be a really short element
21:06 - here but check this out in the final
21:07 - version i actually wanted to scroll like
21:10 - this so that means we need to
21:13 - give this an overflow x scroll so let's
21:16 - go back to pricing body and we're going
21:19 - to say under overflow hidden we're going
21:21 - to say overflow
21:22 - x
21:23 - and auto that should give us the option
21:26 - of when we are scrolling
21:29 - of scrolling those features it's kind of
21:31 - a thing that like apple does and you
21:33 - know it's kind of a neat mobile
21:34 - convention so just to wrap up here
21:37 - uh let's find our spot again so we did
21:40 - the first child
21:41 - just a couple more things
21:43 - we're gonna go pricing body ul
21:47 - li nth child two n so every second one
21:51 - what's happening background color
21:54 - it's gonna be e eighty eight e eight
21:57 - just darken it a little bit more
21:59 - just to stand out
22:02 - we're going to go pricing footer
22:05 - the padding top will be zero
22:10 - to remove that padding and then we've
22:12 - already did the margin top for the
22:13 - pricing popular
22:15 - last not but not least pricing popular
22:18 - and then pricing header
22:22 - we're gonna copy that
22:24 - and within that we're going to go
22:25 - pricing footer so we're going to select
22:27 - the header and footer in the popular
22:31 - element and say
22:32 - padding
22:35 - top
22:37 - 30 pixels
22:38 - done
22:39 - that's all the styles check it out in
22:41 - our browser the final result
22:45 - we have their basic and our awesome and
22:48 - every new elements here every new
22:50 - feature gets added so that when you're
22:51 - on your mobile device you can scroll
22:53 - that left and right
