00:07 - hey everybody its Jessie and it's good
00:12 - to be back I have a good weekend I hope
00:14 - all you had a good weekend as well today
00:22 - we're gonna start by going over a pull
00:26 - request so I got a really big pull
00:32 - request let me bring this over and y'all
00:37 - can check this out it's you can see
00:40 - there's a lot it's lot going on here
00:44 - okay so this pull request 41 so if you
00:49 - want to check it out the link to the
00:51 - repo is in the description and I I went
01:00 - over all of it this morning but I
01:05 - haven't merged it yet because there's
01:08 - there's a lot going on here and there
01:10 - are some big decisions made so I thought
01:14 - I'd like to give all of you an
01:16 - opportunity to give me some feedback let
01:20 - me know what your opinion is before we
01:22 - merge it since it's such a significant
01:25 - change to the project so just to give
01:29 - you well I'll go over and let you see if
01:35 - you can't bring this up on your own
01:37 - computer right now I'll bring it up so
01:41 - really appreciate this pull request that
01:44 - definitely addresses a lot of things
01:46 - some things that I had kind of realized
01:49 - but just figured out I'll do that later
01:51 - and there's some other things that I
01:53 - didn't even realize yet like for
01:56 - instance I had just done this I think on
02:00 - Friday and didn't even notice that I was
02:03 - getting this warning so I don't know
02:07 - maybe at some point I probably would
02:09 - have seen that but it's nice that this
02:12 - was caught
02:13 - so soon but so some of these are I think
02:18 - may help with some errors that have been
02:22 - reported or people are trying to run
02:24 - this trying to you know clone the repo
02:27 - and and start it up and they're getting
02:30 - some errors so I think this this issue
02:36 - here is probably where some of the
02:41 - errors were coming from so I know I had
02:44 - somebody recently on I think it was
02:48 - Twitter messaged me about it
02:50 - yes I think it was Nathaniel who's in
02:53 - the in the live chat you know frequently
02:56 - had a similar issue where basically I'll
03:02 - show you since I have it up now so
03:06 - basically was saying handle close isn't
03:08 - defined so this seems like that would
03:12 - fix it would fix that problem but here's
03:17 - the so here's some of the things that
03:21 - I'm not sure about and you know if you
03:24 - have a chance to go through and let me
03:28 - know what you think I'd really
03:28 - appreciate that but it is it is a lot so
03:32 - I'm gonna try to point out just a few of
03:35 - the areas that I'm not sure about I
03:37 - don't maybe understand fully and that
03:39 - way it'll narrow it down a bit if you
03:41 - don't really want to take the time to go
03:42 - through all of it maybe if you could
03:46 - just check out the few sections that I'm
03:48 - not sure about that would be helpful and
03:51 - one of the things I'm not sure about so
03:53 - I'm I'm sure that this change will fix
03:56 - some of those errors from from what I've
03:59 - seen and what I've read about it after
04:02 - I've done a bit of research to try to
04:05 - figure out exactly what's what the issue
04:07 - was so I know before in a lot of videos
04:13 - before we've been using arrow functions
04:16 - because it helps with this right inside
04:19 - the the function so we get the right
04:21 - value for this but evidently there are
04:24 - some problems
04:26 - with using arrow functions as well that
04:28 - I was not aware of so I'll show you I
04:33 - just did something so the new way so
04:37 - basically and you can see how so the
04:41 - pull request is from Matt right so you
04:42 - can see how Matt redid everything to
04:44 - this way but I just wanted to understand
04:47 - it myself so I was already adding this
04:50 - hover effect and I figured well okay
04:53 - well normally I would do this with arrow
04:54 - functions but I'm gonna try it this
04:56 - other way so basically we bind this
05:00 - inside this constructor and then instead
05:05 - of using arrow functions here we just
05:08 - use normal functions and then we call it
05:13 - you know normally down here so I am
05:15 - checking for a prop because I don't want
05:18 - the hover effect to be the default but
05:20 - basically it's just this onmouseout or
05:23 - onmouseover alright see I mean you can
05:26 - get the you get the point let me make it
05:29 - a bit bigger just in case you can't you
05:33 - can't see so I mean if you've been
05:34 - following these videos or you use react
05:37 - on your own you could probably see
05:39 - what's going on here the alternative
05:43 - being so right now in side nav right
05:45 - we're not binding this in the
05:47 - constructor we're just going handle
05:50 - clothes for we're putting in putting
05:52 - this in the Aero function I mean we're
05:57 - still calling it down here the the same
05:59 - way right so that's one of the things
06:04 - I'm just I'm not sure about what are the
06:06 - pros and cons of each I mean the the
06:10 - very the obvious thing is that this is a
06:13 - shorter way of doing things obviously
06:17 - especially you start to get more of
06:19 - these you know can really add up
06:21 - so aside from from this being the
06:24 - shorter way you know look is there some
06:28 - way I guess what I'm wondering is is
06:30 - there some way to keep this okay just
06:34 - like this the nice
06:38 - you know just one line really easy but
06:43 - then still avoid any errors that might
06:46 - arise from this so like the air that
06:48 - Nathaniel was having in particular where
06:50 - it it won't load the page for him and
06:54 - keep saying that it's not found so
06:57 - that's the one thing I'm a little bit
06:59 - I'm unsure about I try to do some
07:02 - research but just really didn't find a
07:07 - definitive answer so I'm I'm fine with
07:10 - doing it like this but I kind of want to
07:12 - get I want to get to the bottom of the
07:14 - issue and figure out like is there one
07:16 - way that is recognized as the best
07:20 - practice I know sometimes that there's
07:23 - there's not a way so that's I mean
07:25 - that's just how it is sometimes there's
07:27 - it's debated and I'm okay if it's
07:29 - debatable then I'm fine with going this
07:32 - way because I'd rather you know add
07:34 - another line or two and make sure that
07:37 - there are no errors that's that's fine
07:39 - with me but I thought this would just be
07:43 - a good time to to see all right how
07:46 - should we really be doing this so that's
07:50 - one issue the other issue that I wasn't
07:54 - sure about let's see
08:02 - I guess there's two more I wasn't sure
08:04 - about so this is so Matt's adjusted the
08:08 - components to initialize state in the
08:10 - class constructor so we are using the
08:14 - constructor here we're using the
08:15 - constructor here but I know in other
08:19 - components were not let me try to find
08:24 - one where we're not inside
08:35 - I guess we are in a lot of them so maybe
08:43 - I don't have one that I'm using that's
08:48 - easy to find oh here we go alright so
08:54 - here's the example so instead of doing
08:56 - this where I've just set state very
09:00 - simply instead using the constructor and
09:07 - using this set state so from what I
09:12 - understand and what I've seen in the
09:13 - pool request everywhere that I've done
09:15 - this has now been changed to use the
09:18 - constructor is that what I should be
09:21 - doing and this this really is not so
09:24 - much me like calling into question the
09:25 - pool request or doubting that at all
09:27 - because I think it's really solid and it
09:29 - definitely shows like Matt knows what
09:31 - he's doing and he did take the time you
09:34 - know to explain and not even just in the
09:37 - pool request but in comments to previous
09:41 - videos and things so this is more for my
09:44 - understanding of how have I been doing
09:46 - it wrong should I be doing it better I
09:49 - mean I want to do it better you know for
09:51 - myself because I want to do good work
09:53 - but also if I'm going to be putting this
09:55 - stuff on YouTube I don't want to mislead
09:57 - anyone into doing the wrong thing so
10:02 - that's another thing I'm just I'm not
10:05 - sure about I had been using this and
10:08 - it's been working right I haven't been
10:10 - getting any errors but maybe there's
10:12 - some there's some problem with this that
10:15 - I'm not aware of and I should be doing
10:17 - this all the time instead of this so
10:21 - that's number two number three is
10:23 - there's not really going to be any
10:25 - demonstration I just just need to say it
10:27 - so matt has ejected create react app so
10:33 - if you remember I don't know one of the
10:35 - the first few videos that we did for
10:38 - this project we actually tried to eject
10:42 - it so we did it we made a whole nother
10:46 - project folder in clone
10:48 - this project into that folder we ejected
10:51 - and then we compared side-by-side the
10:53 - the structure of the folders right so
10:57 - the reason that he ejected has to do
11:02 - with the sass files so he I guess and
11:08 - this is where like his his abilities
11:11 - definitely go beyond my own in terms of
11:14 - setting up web pack because I'm not
11:16 - really that great with web pack so I'm
11:20 - definitely going by his explanation
11:23 - because I've never done this with web
11:25 - pack but it seems like what's going on
11:28 - is that the Styles can be so like
11:36 - there's no more CSS files when we're in
11:39 - development and the sass it's just sass
11:43 - files so I mean I guess that's cool
11:46 - saying basically that when you go to
11:47 - build then they'll be CSS files but not
11:50 - during the dev process which should
11:53 - speed things up also the the way the
11:59 - sass files are set up is is different so
12:03 - let me show you and of course you know
12:06 - this is all available you can check this
12:07 - out or on your own but everything's set
12:10 - up like this now and you can see there's
12:12 - some comments for explaining how to
12:15 - import files and so I guess I would I
12:22 - wouldn't have to import any more into my
12:25 - components I could just use it all so
12:29 - this part I'm not gonna lie I'm I'm not
12:32 - exactly sure how this is gonna work just
12:34 - from reading this I'm sure if I tried to
12:36 - use it you know I catch on but anyway as
12:41 - you can see this is a really big pull
12:44 - request a lot of stuff has changed so
12:48 - definitely didn't want to just merge
12:50 - this in and say hey everybody hope you
12:52 - had a nice weekend everything's changed
12:56 - so that said there's definitely some
13:00 - good thing I think
13:01 - some good things in here and then
13:03 - there's some things that I'm just not
13:04 - sure about and it might be just because
13:06 - of my inexperience so I'm gonna leave it
13:10 - all to you let me know I don't think I'm
13:13 - gonna make a decision on this yet I
13:14 - think I'm gonna you all can let me know
13:19 - what you think in the live chat we're
13:21 - gonna do some code on on some other
13:23 - components so I'm just gonna jump right
13:24 - into what I was working on I just said
13:27 - my Pomodoro cycle and right when I
13:31 - started so this is kind of nice because
13:33 - this has been my little break in between
13:34 - we'll go right back into another one and
13:36 - start coding and that'll give you all a
13:39 - chance if you want to to check out the
13:42 - the pool request on github and then
13:46 - maybe later on either in one of the
13:48 - breaks between coding sessions or at the
13:51 - end then maybe we could try to come to
13:54 - some sort of consensus and that might
13:57 - not be a bad idea in case of people that
13:58 - can't watch until later they can still
14:01 - have a chance to join in so I will take
14:07 - a look at what's going on in the live
14:09 - chat since I started and then then I'm
14:14 - gonna start my timer and and get to work
14:17 - we're gonna be working on that generic
14:19 - card component I'll show you I already
14:22 - showed you how may the hover effect so I
14:24 - don't really need to go over that again
14:25 - but I would like to show you what I've
14:27 - done so far and making them I would like
14:30 - to have the option to make them links
14:32 - like the entire card be a link that you
14:34 - could click on I know that's not the
14:36 - normal I mean normally with material
14:40 - design you have little buttons at the
14:41 - bottom and you click those but I think
14:46 - yeah I'm pretty sure I've seen in apps
14:49 - like mobile apps Google Apps where you
14:54 - can click and the entire card is a link
14:57 - I'm thinking in particular the news so
15:01 - it still might be within the parameters
15:03 - material design but you'll see what I if
15:05 - you don't order to get what I'm saying
15:07 - then you you'll see in a minute I had
15:11 - someone in here at a few hours ago
15:15 - giving a bunch of emojis and things so
15:18 - that was kind of funny to see that but
15:21 - no one no one was in there and I didn't
15:23 - really see it until the person already
15:26 - left so let's see aside from that let's
15:33 - see
15:38 - both are correct okay
15:41 - hey everybody I see people were saying
15:44 - hi
15:57 - okay all right I'm getting some good
15:59 - feedback already basically just to sum
16:03 - up just for time it seems that the way
16:08 - that we have been doing things is
16:09 - allowed with the es es2016 syntax okay
16:21 - so some of the newer JavaScript syntax
16:24 - allows what we have been doing and so
16:30 - some of the stuff I guess that's in this
16:33 - pull request works as well but it's an
16:38 - older way of doing things so okay well
16:44 - at least I know I haven't been
16:45 - misleading people and doing the wrong
16:46 - thing I still really do want to know if
16:49 - I guess what with the what the error was
16:54 - coming from and how do I avoid that
16:58 - using the new syntax
17:10 - okay all right I'm going to so far a
17:14 - really good feedback thank you I'm gonna
17:17 - keep thinking about this as well while
17:20 - we're doing the other stuff because to
17:23 - be honest with you like I really I
17:26 - really appreciate all the effort that
17:29 - this took that Matt put into this so I
17:33 - almost kind of wish it were split up a
17:38 - bit into different pool requests you
17:46 - know because then I could pull in just
17:47 - the things that I know I want for sure
17:49 - and then have a little bit more time to
17:51 - think about the other stuff
17:53 - so I don't know if Matt's watching or
17:57 - not and I'd really I'd hate to ask him
17:58 - to redo it and split it up because he
18:00 - put so much work into it but we'll see
18:04 - well I don't want to decide yet it will
18:06 - give it will give it a little bit of
18:07 - time to think about it
18:16 - okay so let me show you I'm gonna pull
18:20 - this over to the side for now let me
18:23 - show you what I've been working on so
18:25 - here's the the nice hover so now if you
18:30 - do want to add a hover to any time
18:34 - you're using the generic card component
18:36 - and I mean this is in my project or if
18:39 - you clone this project and you want to
18:40 - use it to start so I know there are some
18:43 - people that have cloned this project in
18:45 - the previous project and are just
18:47 - modifying it and using it as the basis
18:49 - for another project which i think is
18:52 - really really cool I've gotten to see
18:53 - some some of you have sent me links
18:57 - either to a live demo or the repo and
19:00 - I've been able to like clone it and run
19:02 - it and it's really really cool seeing
19:05 - how you modified what I've done made it
19:07 - better adapted it so anyway if anybody's
19:10 - going that and you haven't told me about
19:11 - it I definitely want to know because I
19:13 - think it's really cool but anyway in let
19:20 - me show you how to use this
19:21 - okay so right now I'm using the generic
19:24 - art component in posters j/s so I have
19:28 - put in the actual content that is that
19:31 - it's supposed to be in there got rid of
19:33 - all the lorem ipsum and now if you add
19:36 - hover Abul to the generic art component
19:40 - you get that that hover effect which
19:42 - material UI has built in this depth or
19:46 - it's the z-depth but it's on the paper
19:49 - elements you can't use it on the card
19:51 - you have to use it on paper so I had to
19:53 - wrap this in paper and the only thing I
19:58 - had to do I don't think I had to change
20:04 - anything else yeah everything else I
20:08 - think stayed the same yeah because we
20:12 - had bound the styles to get some of the
20:15 - other things working like our flexbox
20:17 - stuff too whatever the the div is that's
20:21 - an immediate child of our other div so
20:26 - like our container did
20:29 - here this column so when we switched it
20:32 - off for paper when all this gets
20:34 - converted to just plain HTML it's still
20:37 - just a div so since we set up our Styles
20:40 - like that it was actually kind of nice
20:41 - had we added the style directly to the
20:46 - card in some other way or you know with
20:48 - a class it actually would have been more
20:50 - work so I didn't do that on purpose
20:53 - but it ended up being working out well
20:55 - we did have to get rid of the Box shadow
20:58 - on the card because we were having a
21:00 - double box shadow so that's kind of the
21:03 - only thing we had to we had to change
21:06 - from the default behavior of the card
21:09 - but otherwise that's working well so
21:12 - what I'm what I'm using now is okay I
21:18 - just got Sebastian just popped into
21:20 - Instagram and sent me a message so all
21:23 - right I got a Sebastian cool thank you
21:27 - so what I'm trying to do now is make it
21:31 - so that these can be links so I'd like
21:35 - for users obviously when it when they
21:37 - get that little hover effect that should
21:39 - immediately say this is clickable right
21:42 - that's why I'm adding the the hover
21:44 - effect also obviously the cursor changes
21:48 - so I want this to be a link and you can
21:52 - see I've already it I've already done
21:54 - that here it's linking out somewhere
21:56 - this is also linking this one uses a
22:00 - regular just a tag and then this one is
22:03 - using the react route or link component
22:07 - but here's the problem that I just
22:10 - noticed literally two minutes before I
22:12 - started this stream I thought like hey I
22:14 - got this I'm gonna be able to commit
22:16 - this before the stream and then I
22:18 - noticed this our flexbox stuff that was
22:21 - giving us a uniform height for all of
22:27 - our cards is not working which I kind of
22:31 - anticipated but I was a part of me was
22:35 - hoping it would just work I did think it
22:38 - would might not work
22:44 - let's see so that's that's basically our
22:49 - first challenge and I just remember that
22:51 - I forgot to set my Pomodoro timer so I'm
22:53 - setting it now and I'll bring it over
22:56 - here CEO can see yes so that's our
23:01 - challenge we want it to be a link but we
23:04 - also want the Flex bug stuff to still
23:06 - work so here's what I'm thinking
23:10 - I'm thinking that I'll move instead of
23:12 - wrapping things in a link here which
23:16 - honestly kind of makes it a bit more
23:18 - messy why not make it an option within
23:23 - the component so that I can pass a prop
23:25 - saying you know it's like probably I
23:30 - could just pass the prop giving the URL
23:32 - and then if that URL is there then it
23:37 - will use the link if not it won't be a
23:42 - link so my first attempt at a twitch
23:45 - I've I've since gotten rid of because it
23:47 - didn't work was I I tried to put in like
23:50 - within JavaScript in here in a ternary
23:54 - just to put a beginning link tag and
23:57 - then put the closing a tag down here
24:00 - that didn't work so I never really tried
24:06 - it before but I got an error when it got
24:08 - to the the a tag that was just the
24:11 - closing one so the slash a and I got an
24:15 - error there so I guess it just it can't
24:18 - handle I guess having the tags within
24:26 - JavaScript dependent on you know whether
24:29 - or not in this case we have a URL so the
24:34 - other option I'd rather not do this but
24:37 - the other option would be just to
24:39 - completely copy this and have a version
24:42 - that would use that would have the link
24:46 - in there I'd rather not do that I
24:52 - actually I just thought of another
24:54 - option that might be better I could take
24:55 - all of this
24:56 - card stuff and make it a constant and
25:01 - then at least I wouldn't have to copy
25:05 - all of this so not really sure maybe
25:11 - there's another maybe there's another
25:15 - way to do this so I'm gonna check let's
25:21 - see I'm gonna check the live chat just
25:26 - really quickly just in case anyone has
25:30 - pointed something obvious out that I'm
25:32 - missing
25:50 - and someone with the the tag lol lol
25:55 - which I've seen before which I'm not
25:58 - sure if it's if it's meaning to be laugh
26:00 - out loud laugh out loud or not but
26:02 - they're saying some really like
26:04 - depressing stuff and that's live chat
26:06 - which I'm not going to share because he
26:07 - wants to be depressed but it's like
26:10 - ironic right because they're they're
26:13 - tagged on YouTube oh well anyway I
26:16 - thought it was ironic all right so let's
26:20 - do this
26:29 - tyronn says can you put your cards in a
26:32 - div and then call display flex well I I
26:36 - could so I I kind of thought of that too
26:38 - like okay well what if I just put a div
26:41 - around here like a container div but
26:44 - then I thought okay well that's just
26:46 - going to be another level of divs that I
26:49 - have here that's just going to kind of
26:50 - make this a little bit more messy so I
26:55 - think I kind of want to put I do want to
27:01 - have this option in the component itself
27:04 - and that was kind of the whole point of
27:05 - this component was we wanted to have one
27:07 - component that could do anything you
27:09 - would want to do with a card
27:10 - you just had to pass in the right props
27:13 - so that was the idea I'm actually not
27:17 - sure like was that a good idea I don't
27:20 - know I think it's useful in terms of
27:22 - performance
27:23 - I don't really know enough to know
27:25 - whether or not this is more performant
27:28 - than doing it the normal way with
27:29 - materiai and importing all the different
27:31 - parts of the card but this is kind of
27:35 - like a really simple react app I don't
27:38 - think we're gonna have to optimize for
27:40 - performance like a lot we're not I don't
27:45 - know sometimes projects that are really
27:47 - simple it's just not worth it to try to
27:49 - think about stuff like that early on you
27:52 - know just get it done and then go from
27:54 - there
27:54 - all right so let's some first things
27:59 - first I want to test it out and just
28:01 - make sure what I'm trying to do is going
28:03 - to work so I am actually just gonna copy
28:05 - all of this stuff and just see if it
28:08 - works and then we can work on
28:10 - refactoring it to make it hopefully a
28:13 - lot smaller so this is going to be our
28:18 - normal let's go let me get rid of that
28:22 - space and we'll need we can keep paper
28:28 - as the element that's around at all and
28:34 - we're gonna copy this
28:40 - now let's see we want to check for I
28:51 - think I'll have two different option
28:54 - because we're gonna end up either using
28:55 - an a tag or a length tag depending on
28:58 - whether it's an external link or an
28:59 - internal link so I'm gonna need to check
29:03 - yeah I'll need to check for that as well
29:06 - so we'll have to pass that in as a prop
29:09 - so they'll actually be two different
29:10 - props that will get passed in it'll
29:13 - either be for an external link I think
29:15 - we'll call it URL and then those you
29:18 - could just put the URL in for an
29:20 - internal link we'll call it let's call
29:23 - it link I guess we could I guess we call
29:25 - it internal link an external link that
29:28 - might be better okay that would be more
29:31 - descriptive and obvious so in turn
29:45 - let's see if internal link mm no I just
29:57 - let's see internal link or
30:11 - Pixar Inc
30:16 - No
30:21 - all right I'm not gonna get complicated
30:24 - first let's just see the do the first
30:26 - thing if it's an internal link then we
30:31 - want to whoops wrong thing there we go
30:36 - send its own link we want to render this
30:41 - with
30:50 - with the a tag
31:06 - all right so if if the internal link
31:12 - prop is passed then it will be the href
31:17 - for this a tag and
31:31 - if it's not present then it's gonna
31:39 - render what we had there already okay
31:57 - alright I'm gonna say that I should make
32:00 - sure don't get errors okay great now
32:02 - there is yet and let's get rid of this
32:11 - and we'll test out our internal internal
32:21 - link equals if I stood ice yeah let
32:28 - me grab that link address gonna put that
32:34 - in there and now let's save it and it
32:38 - should be the same great okay so it is
32:40 - the same you can see that's that's
32:43 - working and these other cards are not
32:47 - links we hover over them and not links
32:49 - great so that part is working okay
32:58 - so I guess for the sake of anyone who's
33:01 - not that familiar with reactor what
33:03 - we're doing I'm not gonna be able to
33:06 - explain everything that's going on but
33:07 - let me try to explain a little bit so
33:10 - what we've done here is basically like
33:12 - in NFL's statement but it's with what's
33:15 - called the the ternary operator so
33:17 - basically when we see that question mark
33:21 - and then : here that means if internal
33:26 - link is is true so if it exists right if
33:29 - it has a value then we're going to do
33:32 - this this first thing else we're gonna
33:37 - do this second thing okay that's what
33:38 - we've done now this is really nice but
33:41 - it's not going to be enough because we
33:43 - want to do three things so we want to
33:48 - check if there's an internal link or if
33:54 - there is an external link
34:08 - the reason being I'd like to use what we
34:10 - need to use the link component actually
34:16 - what would make this really easy and I
34:18 - should just check this let's try this
34:20 - right now here's here's my idea that
34:24 - could just make this whole thing a lot
34:25 - more simple if we use the link component
34:28 - but we pass in this as the href will it
34:37 - still navigate because I think so we're
34:42 - doing that right here and if we inspect
34:44 - it we can see that we're actually
34:52 - getting an a tag and then this is the
34:54 - href so I say that's worth a shot
35:00 - because we'll be able to keep it really
35:01 - simple just really simple ternary yeah
35:06 - let's let's try that and in that case we
35:12 - won't even have to have two different
35:13 - props which I kind of didn't want
35:14 - because that's one more thing that you
35:16 - have to try to remember as a prop so we
35:20 - can change the prop to just be linked
35:28 - and let's change this to linked
35:39 - and then our age link
35:46 - and then this is going to be I believe
35:49 - it's too I have I think I have
35:53 - documentation for a crowd or open on my
35:55 - other screen I do so our link is going
35:58 - to be yes it is too and we need to
36:06 - import this
36:07 - so let's import have it up here yes I do
36:11 - great so we can remove yeah we can get
36:18 - rid of this here we're not going to use
36:20 - it here anymore but we're going to use
36:21 - it here so hopefully I hope you can see
36:32 - and I'm sure a lot of you can already
36:35 - appreciate this but by doing it this way
36:38 - and including it in this component we
36:41 - can use this component in a lot of
36:43 - different places and not have to worry
36:45 - about including you know these things
36:48 - and wrapping things so we're simplifying
36:54 - every single time this gets used now it
36:57 - will be more simple to use already we
37:00 - won't have to include things if we would
37:02 - have continued with what we are doing
37:04 - here and and wrapping this you know in
37:07 - our posters j/s component and then we'd
37:10 - also have to do the same thing in any
37:12 - other component we had so it takes a
37:15 - little bit more work at first not that
37:18 - much more work but I think in the long
37:21 - run it definitely helps alright so I'd
37:27 - like to remove this okay should we put I
37:36 - guess we are using is exact let's see
37:44 - this exact true I just can I put it like
37:49 - that and I was just thinking do I pass
37:56 - in true as a string or do I pass in true
38:00 - within JavaScript oh well I'm not
38:03 - getting any errors like this and I'm
38:05 - assume that there's type checking and
38:08 - react router so I guess this works
38:18 - actually not I just think about it I'm I
38:20 - may be getting a warning
38:21 - I just haven't looked at the console in
38:23 - a while all right so now we're gonna
38:26 - pass in what we had before
38:30 - oops link is not defined yeah it is
38:35 - defined now did I take it out yeah okay
38:41 - and what did I call that I think the
38:48 - slash
38:53 - so there's actually a page for poster
38:55 - videos that I completely forgot about
38:57 - and I hadn't shown any of you so that's
38:59 - one more page who have to work on
39:00 - fortunately we should just be able to
39:03 - copy exactly what we did in the tutorial
39:06 - page and just use it I think there's
39:09 - maybe four videos maybe five I don't
39:12 - know no more than five videos that we'll
39:16 - just put in a page this won't be
39:19 - difficult alright and that I ever
39:23 - changed this no let's change this oops
39:28 - link alright let's make sure we've saved
39:31 - everything let's see alright great no
39:36 - errors so we have this one and this one
39:39 - let's see so I can't click this because
39:41 - I haven't actually made the page yet so
39:43 - it's not gonna take nanny to the page
39:47 - great so these are actually links they
39:50 - work I guess I could click great the
39:56 - only thing that I'm not doing now that
39:58 - it might be nice to do is open the
40:02 - external links in a new window I'm not
40:08 - sure I don't know if that's gonna be a
40:10 - huge deal that would be something that
40:13 - would be nice I would say that's
40:17 - something that it could be added like to
40:19 - the list of things to do to finish this
40:22 - up and really make it polish at the end
40:25 - but I don't need to ship with that
40:27 - feature I don't know let me know maybe
40:30 - you disagree on that because I would
40:37 - need then to check assuming that I don't
40:39 - want people to have to put in another
40:41 - prop I would probably have to check to
40:48 - see if it's a full URL I guess that's
40:54 - how I would do it to make to see if it's
40:56 - HTTP or HTTPS
41:01 - and that still wouldn't be a foolproof
41:03 - check right somebody could enter in I
41:06 - don't know I'm probably overthinking
41:08 - this anyway basically I think that's
41:11 - mission accomplished right we have our
41:15 - our flex box stuff that's giving us the
41:19 - same height for up for all our our cars
41:23 - is working again our links are working
41:28 - our hovers working so I think that's
41:33 - good
41:33 - let me check I'm going to check the live
41:35 - chat really quick just to make sure I
41:37 - didn't make any mistakes before I commit
41:39 - this
41:51 - oh cool Patrick had a good thought and
41:53 - you had this you had this way before I
41:56 - did Patrick so good job on that sorry I
42:00 - didn't look over and see it but he said
42:02 - I can check I can just use one prop URL
42:07 - and then I can check if the value starts
42:09 - with a slash and that's how I can
42:12 - determine whether its internal or
42:13 - external that's better I think that
42:15 - would be more reasonable than checking
42:17 - for HTTP or HTTPS yeah I like that idea
42:41 - breakpoint said page not found is on the
42:44 - github page not the previous code with
42:47 - the es6 syntax github pages doesn't play
42:51 - nicely with react router I believe and
42:53 - could be the cause yes that's so
42:58 - reacts the routing is a bit messed up
43:03 - for the github pages thing
43:15 - okay all right cool so it looks like
43:26 - looks like I haven't I haven't messed
43:28 - this up
43:29 - too much so I do have some good ideas
43:31 - for ways to improve it but in terms of
43:34 - basically doing what we wanted to do at
43:36 - this point I think I'm safe to commit
43:39 - this and then possibly revisit it with
43:42 - some of those improvements namely making
43:48 - it basically setting target --blank
43:50 - to make things open a new window if it's
43:53 - an external link and then open in the
43:56 - same window if it's an internal link
43:58 - which is a pretty standard behavior that
44:00 - users expect I think I know I'm a little
44:04 - bit annoyed if I click a link an
44:06 - external link and it doesn't open in a
44:08 - new in a new tab so I don't know about
44:14 - you but that's that's what I've come to
44:15 - expect and I I like it that I like that
44:19 - so let me let me make this bigger there
44:25 - we go and let's check the status okay
44:33 - and so we're just doing to get commits
44:38 - we're adding at the same time and
44:40 - putting our message in all at the same
44:42 - time and let's see
44:55 - should I call the ocean feeling okay I
44:59 - think that's about right
45:27 - all right great everything past it works
45:30 - and I will push it up to github alright
45:39 - awesome so now that is up on github and
45:46 - two minutes actually I'm gonna I'm gonna
45:51 - do my break right now because if you
45:53 - remember I did forget to start my timer
45:55 - so it's been longer than 25 minutes so I
45:58 - don't want to start something new with
45:59 - two minutes left anyway so we're gonna
46:01 - do the short break I'm gonna take five
46:03 - minutes I'm gonna try to catch up in the
46:04 - live chat after that five minutes we're
46:07 - gonna go back and do another 25 minute
46:09 - session of coding after that we'll see
46:12 - we might be finished at that point I do
46:15 - want to make sure I get done in time to
46:17 - go home and take my son to karate on
46:21 - time today so it's not gonna be a super
46:24 - long stream definitely like to keep it
46:27 - under an hour and a half today so I
46:30 - think if that's the goal then probably
46:33 - just one more appointment or recession
46:35 - will be all we'll be able to fit in I
46:38 - just got a message that the stream
46:40 - status is now bad so in terms of quality
46:44 - let me know what it looks like for you
46:47 - all I'm not sure why OBS which is the
46:51 - the streaming software is telling me
46:53 - that I still have good quality going
46:56 - through so over 5,000 kilobits per
46:59 - second so I'm not sure what's going on
47:01 - there okay let's see I'm gonna scroll up
47:08 - a bit so I don't miss anything
47:15 - let's see I say it says I'm interested
47:20 - in contributing to this project that's
47:24 - awesome thank you yeah definitely check
47:28 - out github check out the repo see where
47:30 - you can contribute if you're if you
47:33 - don't really know where you can
47:34 - contribute let me know like send me a
47:36 - message and I could maybe give you some
47:39 - ideas of things that that could be done
47:44 - so yeah but definitely I would I would
47:48 - like it if you'd contribute umberto says
47:52 - for all the dotnet developers out there
47:54 - dotnet core 2 was just released a few
47:56 - hours ago so that sounds cool I don't
47:59 - really use dotnet often I see I did have
48:03 - to work with net last week uh-huh just
48:07 - for a bit I didn't really do much with
48:09 - it I actually just walked into
48:10 - somebody's office who was having trouble
48:12 - with it and they just showed me what
48:15 - they were trying to do that wouldn't
48:17 - work and then it worked
48:18 - so I I don't I didn't really do anything
48:21 - but it worked so that was that's the
48:25 - extent of my DUT and that experience
48:36 - okay Alejandro says guys do you think an
48:41 - IQ of 106 is good enough to be a
48:42 - programmer let's see I'm sure you you
48:45 - got some responses in the live chat my
48:47 - response to that question is going to be
48:53 - well first of all assuming that the IQ
48:56 - assessment is accurate right because I'm
48:59 - I don't know like if you get an official
49:02 - IQ test I suppose like you could maybe
49:05 - trust the accuracy of that although I
49:07 - mean it depends on different factors
49:08 - everybody some people just have a bad
49:10 - day right so assuming it's not just one
49:13 - of these online IQ tests it's not
49:15 - official and that is really the IQ which
49:19 - I'm a bit skeptical of but if it is then
49:22 - I would say it's it's fine to be a
49:24 - programmer I I guess I kind of think of
49:31 - it in terms of mental capacity and IQ I
49:34 - like to make an analogy to like physical
49:38 - capability in sports right there are
49:42 - definitely been instances where people
49:44 - who aren't physically like really big
49:47 - are able to let's I mean I'm from the
49:49 - United States and I played football
49:51 - which I you say American football
49:55 - so I'm most familiar with that so I'm
49:58 - gonna say that analogy of the sorry
50:00 - because I know a lot of you are not from
50:02 - the other states you might not be
50:03 - familiar but basically if you're not
50:04 - familiar with it
50:05 - the bigger you are usually it's a lot
50:08 - easier to play football if you're bigger
50:11 - right so people who are bigger usually
50:16 - don't have to work as hard to be good
50:18 - but there are lots of examples of people
50:20 - making it all the way to professional
50:23 - football and they're not really that big
50:27 - but they put in a lot of work so I think
50:33 - it's possible to be a good developer
50:36 - even with a lower IQ but you may have to
50:40 - put in more work so I don't think that
50:45 - there's like a cut-off of like a if your
50:47 - IQs this don't even
50:48 - no it's just just you got to work right
50:51 - so it's Sammy with a nice boy like if
50:54 - you're short and you want to play a
50:55 - basketball well like you better really
50:57 - work on your shooting because you're not
51:00 - gonna be really close dunking the ball
51:02 - or anything like that you're gonna be a
51:04 - three-point shooter or something you
51:05 - know I don't really know what sports you
51:07 - all are into what metaphors would work
51:10 - for you but I think that that works as
51:15 - well with with mental capacity to a
51:17 - certain extent so anyway and I'd say
51:22 - this like I'll take somebody with a low
51:24 - IQ that loves coding and has it really
51:27 - like a desire to learn and a hunger for
51:30 - learning I'll take that person over
51:32 - somebody who's a genius and thinks they
51:36 - know is ever they know everything and
51:38 - doesn't really take the time to learn
51:40 - learn new things right I mean that's I
51:45 - don't know
51:46 - that's my it's my opinion on it there
51:48 - are other things other than just IQ that
51:51 - go into being a good programmer so
51:54 - anyway I took up all my time on one
51:56 - question sorry about that but I don't I
52:01 - thought it was a kind of an important
52:03 - question
52:08 - all right
52:13 - okay one last thing I just saw Sebastian
52:17 - said I just submitted a PR a pull
52:18 - request adding react helmet make sure
52:22 - everything is okay because I have some
52:23 - issues when I pulled your new code okay
52:26 - cool thank you Thank You Sebastian
52:28 - actually that's really cool that you
52:32 - added react helmet I'm assuming that
52:36 - react helmet is with helmet J s right so
52:45 - I'm going to check that
52:52 - maybe it's Sun show you changed your
52:55 - says document heading take some attacks
52:56 - oh okay
53:01 - anyway my other screen I just checked
53:03 - react helmet because I was mistaken and
53:06 - I thought that that was just using
53:08 - helmet je s with react but it's not
53:22 - oh okay is this the same thing that we
53:25 - had on a previous project all right cool
53:29 - I'll check out that PR thanks thanks
53:32 - Sebastian if you're not familiar I was
53:34 - thinking about helmet J s which is like
53:39 - security for node apps so which I've
53:43 - been thinking about including in this
53:45 - project but I mean at this point I don't
53:48 - really need it but before we actually
53:49 - put it on a server I've been thinking
53:51 - about including that if anyone has
53:53 - experience with that I let me know did
53:57 - do you like it have you worked with it
53:59 - how easy or is it to work with is it
54:02 - effective based on the documentation it
54:06 - seems like it would be a good thing to
54:09 - have and it wouldn't really take that
54:10 - long to set up all right let's start the
54:14 - Pomodoro timer for our second coding
54:19 - session I'll come back to the live chat
54:21 - at the end so don't worry if I didn't
54:24 - get to your question yet I'm gonna go
54:25 - back through everything at the end try
54:28 - to get to all the questions all right so
54:32 - we could can we do I'm trying to think
54:38 - of something that would be interesting
54:40 - to do that we haven't done
54:51 - hmm actually let's let's link up this
54:53 - video page let's actually create the
54:55 - page and we'll add in some of the videos
54:57 - and then we'll get to show how to add a
55:00 - route with react router so that might be
55:04 - kind of cool to do I know we did it
55:06 - early on we added react router and did
55:09 - that but I imagine there's probably some
55:12 - people who just started watching who
55:13 - maybe hadn't seen that early on so maybe
55:16 - this will be useful ok so let's go over
55:23 - just just show you what we were doing
55:26 - with react router we can check out side
55:29 - nav j/s and inside nav you can see we're
55:34 - bringing in actually did we bring this
55:39 - in no we have it all in smaller
55:42 - components so we are we gonna have to
55:43 - get sidebar item nav link this time
55:54 - where did we put all our routes oh did
55:56 - we leave our routes in I'm sorry we left
55:59 - them an app there is all our routes
56:05 - okay awesome okay so here's where we put
56:11 - all of our routes we're gonna need
56:16 - another route and I think what did I
56:22 - mean post your videos so I think that's
56:27 - what I put the name is so just to give
56:31 - you kind of a review we're importing
56:33 - browser router route and switch from
56:36 - reactor outer dome okay so see we've
56:40 - wrapped everything in browser router and
56:49 - now we can just put we'll just copy and
56:52 - paste to add another route and
57:03 - those two videos
57:12 - and it's going to be the component
57:13 - poster videos which we haven't made yet
57:15 - so let's make that and okay so in the
57:21 - views folder that's where we're putting
57:22 - all of our all of our views obviously
57:26 - we're gonna want to put post their
57:28 - videos j/s so we're gonna say touch
57:34 - source views coaster touch is now we
57:48 - have posted videos Jess
57:50 - great so I am going to go to our videos
57:59 - page oh wait it was tutorial that's what
58:04 - we called it so I'm gonna go to a
58:06 - tutorial page let's move it over here
58:08 - and then riaf in this one there we go
58:16 - and since these pages are going to be
58:20 - pretty similar I'm just gonna copy
58:23 - everything and paste it over here and I
58:29 - am gonna be able to get rid of some of
58:30 - this so we're not gonna need this
58:33 - paragraph and
58:37 - [Music]
58:43 - we may not need so many divs since we
58:49 - removed that paragraph you'll see
59:00 - we're gonna need to change the name
59:10 - okay so now we have this page we should
59:13 - be able to navigate to it
59:14 - let me alright we should we've taken out
59:18 - the paragraph so we'll know what the
59:22 - page what page we're going to whoops
59:26 - supposed to videos is not defined should
59:34 - be helps did we not
59:42 - we do oh we did not pull it in so sorry
59:47 - I forgot a step so let's let's back up a
59:50 - bit if you remember we we copied this
59:53 - route we put it down here I'm not even
59:56 - gonna look at the live chat right now
59:57 - cuz I'm sure you all caught that and now
59:59 - we're trying to tell me but we did not
60:05 - import it so let's do that now and we're
60:12 - going to import those two videos now
60:24 - it's there we go it works now and if you
60:27 - remember we already added the link with
60:30 - the correct correct route so when we
60:34 - click this we should go to that page
60:36 - great and there we go so we have
60:40 - basically the same content as our
60:42 - tutorial page except we've removed the
60:44 - text all right so what we want to do
60:48 - then I don't think I've shown you the
60:50 - page that that actually has the videos
60:53 - so let me show it to you
61:01 - and I had I think I mentioned earlier
61:04 - but I had actually forgotten that this
61:07 - page even existed
61:08 - and so I happened to click on that link
61:14 - okay so here's the page and so we just
61:19 - have video videos for tutorials for each
61:23 - one of each one of these things and okay
61:29 - so right now we have them all in one
61:31 - card I'm not sure if I like that I think
61:41 - I'd rather have them be multiple cards
61:45 - so each one would be well not not
61:48 - exactly a card right it's just going to
61:50 - be a video with with a box shadow so
61:55 - let's try to do it like that and I know
61:59 - we have labels yeah so we'll add this I
62:08 - think maybe we'll put this as an h2 at
62:10 - the top and then these can be h threes
62:14 - below I have been kind of going with a
62:17 - left align style for for everything so
62:23 - I'm switching from the center line to
62:25 - the left align I'm not a hundred percent
62:28 - sure about it but we'll see how it looks
62:32 - it won't be too hard to go back through
62:35 - and and Center everything if later on we
62:38 - decide that it it looks better centered
62:41 - okay but for now we're gonna one two
62:44 - three four okay so we need four videos
62:49 - so let's let's copy some of this so the
62:53 - first thing I want to do is put in our
62:55 - headers so I can just copy the at our h3
63:01 - component along with everything else
63:02 - just go back to poster videos let's see
63:06 - where we can put this that makes sense
63:08 - that looks
63:09 - looks good so actually since we did have
63:12 - this this paragraph down here that
63:15 - seemed to work and it was within this
63:19 - container div let's try it there so we
63:26 - would say h3 yeah we're gonna an h3 and
63:28 - that first video was PowerPoint right
63:39 - let's see how that looks okay that's not
63:46 - bad it's really some bit small so I've
63:49 - noticed something a little bit odd
64:03 - so my all of my H tags were looking
64:07 - really small way smaller than they
64:09 - normally would be with let's say like a
64:12 - materialized framework which we had used
64:15 - before so what I what I had done so I
64:22 - noticed on one page the H tags were not
64:25 - small they were much bigger and the
64:27 - normal size that I would expect them to
64:28 - be I think it was an h2 and on another
64:30 - page it was really small so I checked
64:32 - them out and the only difference was
64:33 - that on one page the a stag was within a
64:35 - component that had a class of flow text
64:38 - so I tried adding the flow test class to
64:41 - the one that was smaller and it made it
64:43 - look bigger
64:43 - I actually I looked through what was
64:46 - happening in dev tools with which CSS
64:48 - was getting applied and it it looked
64:50 - weird in that nothing from the flow text
64:54 - was actually being applied it was all
64:56 - crossed out
64:57 - you know how things look crossed out on
64:58 - dev tools if it's not in use so it was
65:01 - all crossed out but it had a very
65:05 - obvious effect so not really sure what's
65:09 - going on there maybe it's just some type
65:11 - of bug with dev tools that it's it's
65:14 - crossing it out when it shouldn't be
65:15 - anyway I'm not that worried about it
65:18 - because it works like that so I'll show
65:22 - you the difference you see how that
65:25 - that's much bigger than it was so I'm
65:31 - just gonna have to remember to put flow
65:33 - text on everything which I don't mind
65:35 - flow text even on H tags because it does
65:37 - shrink them down on smaller screen sizes
65:40 - if you're not familiar we imported we
65:43 - brought over the flow text classes from
65:46 - materialise which is a material design
65:49 - framework similar to bootstrap but with
65:52 - material
65:52 - design so material you I didn't have
65:57 - something like that at least I I'm not
65:59 - aware that they have something like that
66:01 - but it's basically make it makes your
66:03 - font responsive so depending on the
66:06 - width of the screen your font is a
66:08 - different size okay so actually I like
66:14 - that I think that that looks okay so
66:17 - let's copy this and we should be able to
66:22 - just copy this container right yes I
66:32 - think so I think I want to keep it all
66:35 - within this wrapper because we have some
66:37 - vertical alignment going on here it
66:40 - won't really matter that much because
66:41 - this is always gonna be taller than the
66:44 - screen but just so that I don't really
66:47 - have to mess with that let's keep
66:49 - everything within that container okay so
66:57 - this should just give us an idea whoops
66:59 - not what we wanted at all
67:01 - so is that probably because of the Flex
67:07 - that we're using so we could probably
67:11 - fix this with just with flexbox stuff so
67:14 - let's give that a shot before I get
67:18 - changing the mark-up yeah that's got to
67:23 - be something with flex because we're
67:25 - giving it a width 100% all right so
67:31 - let's see the line rather yeah
67:39 - all right so let me see in the live chat
67:41 - who is okay breakpoint just asked about
67:48 - the Instagram the Instagram live feed
67:51 - only they only let you do live stream
67:53 - for an hour so I usually just let it go
67:55 - for an hour and then turn it off I don't
67:56 - I don't try to restart it so I sorry you
68:00 - missed the live stream on Instagram but
68:05 - it's only there for an hour okay oh you
68:10 - know what actually I have a guide to
68:12 - flexbox up on my other screen that I
68:14 - never closed out from Friday Oh Patrick
68:19 - city's never been able to find the
68:20 - Instagram feed I'm not really sure the
68:26 - inst I think if you would do if you
68:31 - would search for my Instagram name which
68:34 - I don't remember what it is but it's in
68:36 - the description it should come up as one
68:41 - of the top ones right I
68:43 - I don't really search that much on
68:44 - Instagram so I'm not I'm not entirely
68:46 - sure but I think if you search the exact
68:49 - name then it should come up okay
68:59 - [Music]
69:16 - all right so on my other screen I'm
69:18 - looking at
69:19 - some of the flexbox properties because I
69:23 - can never remember which witchcraft via
69:28 - switch alright let's try this
69:53 - No okay what else I need to do
70:38 - mmm
70:50 - yeah okay so Berto says you can try it
70:53 - try with of 100 VW because 100%
70:58 - translates to 100% of the container
71:00 - that's true
71:02 - but it should so the container div is
71:05 - much bigger so I'm thinking the problem
71:08 - is with Flex something going on with
71:15 - Flex box so let's take off I guess I can
71:19 - I can test this out easily
71:24 - where's my Flex deal and after there we
71:28 - go see so if I take off flex see it's
71:31 - working it's working fine which bad
71:35 - maybe I'll just do that that seems like
71:41 - a much easier solution let's just do
71:43 - that there's we don't really need flex
71:45 - box here there's no sense in vertically
71:47 - aligning these because they're gonna
71:51 - extend that they're much taller than
71:53 - anyone's viewport is gonna be so let's
71:59 - remove the v/line wrapper which will get
72:06 - rid of the display flex
72:16 - I great that works I make sure okay
72:23 - this is behavior we want okay so
72:26 - normally I wouldn't I wouldn't do it
72:28 - like this so I would probably I guess
72:34 - each one would be its own column with
72:37 - the width of 100% but it looks like this
72:40 - is all working out fine the only reason
72:44 - I like to do it like that is
72:45 - occasionally I've run into issues where
72:47 - if I didn't keep the structure of like
72:50 - container row column like the
72:52 - materialized grid structure I would have
72:55 - some on a small screen a very narrow
72:58 - screen you could scroll horizontally and
73:01 - there's this white space and I found
73:03 - that if I always put everything within
73:05 - that structure I don't have that problem
73:07 - seems like I'm not really having that
73:10 - problem here which is okay although I
73:15 - guess I am this should work though
73:19 - because it's not like I'm going outside
73:20 - that structure everything is still
73:22 - within the column so in this case I
73:24 - think we'll be fine the problems that
73:28 - I've had when I've tried to let's say
73:29 - just put an H tag like right within the
73:32 - container and not within a row and then
73:36 - if it's a large amount of text and the
73:38 - age tag then it it goes over but I think
73:42 - we should be fine I do want to put an H
73:48 - in h2
73:56 - let's see where I can put this h2 that
73:59 - would make the most sense maybe I can
74:06 - put it in this
74:15 - mmm I think I wanted yeah I think I can
74:22 - do it like this
74:49 - I can't remember with this page is
74:51 - called poster video tutorials okay and
75:01 - since we're not really gonna do that
75:05 - that vertical-align i guess we don't
75:10 - need this get rid of that and then we
75:24 - can get rid of all of this and this and
75:34 - we can now make this a stateless
75:40 - functional component so let's do that
75:44 - and we want to find another stateless
75:49 - functional component so I can just copy
75:51 - it
76:05 - button
76:14 - did I not make anything see the social
76:17 - component I thought I at least had some
76:21 - of them like that oh well you know I
76:31 - have a lot of them in that pool request
76:36 - which I put on my other screen
76:39 - I guess copy and pasting only really
76:47 - saves you time if you can find what you
76:50 - want a copy
76:59 - alright let's just just type it out
77:03 - there it is
77:05 - yes okay so what we want to do your
77:10 - student side here for now
77:26 - are we even yeah we're not even taking
77:30 - any props right
78:10 - all right see if I did that right
78:16 - hey awesome I did
78:23 - all right cool so I didn't really do a
78:27 - great job of explaining what I was doing
78:29 - so let me take a moment just to explain
78:32 - so we had had in there a little bit of
78:38 - JavaScript to check on the heights of
78:41 - things and the heights of the header and
78:43 - then deduct that from the height of our
78:47 - container
78:48 - okay that was to ensure that when we
78:52 - vertically aligned something it actually
78:54 - was look like it was vertically aligned
78:57 - on the screen and it wasn't thrown off
78:59 - because of the height of the container
79:01 - also it was on on screens where the
79:06 - content didn't take up the entire height
79:08 - what was happening was our container was
79:11 - extending down below even though there
79:13 - was no content there so you would still
79:15 - see the scrollbar you wouldn't see it on
79:17 - a Mac but on Windows and Linux you would
79:19 - see the scroll bar in the browser which
79:22 - made you think you could scroll but you
79:23 - could only scroll down a bit and there
79:25 - was nothing there so I didn't really
79:27 - want that so we had trying to queue it
79:30 - added that in was it it may have been
79:33 - Sebastian if it wasn't Sebastian and I
79:36 - forgot who really did it I apologize but
79:44 - we didn't need that right so well this
79:46 - pages has enough content that that was
79:49 - not necessary so we we took it out since
79:52 - we took it out we didn't need state
79:54 - anymore because you can see that was
79:56 - using state to have this top coordinate
79:59 - so we when we took out state then we no
80:03 - longer needed to have this as a class we
80:06 - could make it a stateless functional
80:08 - component which is a little bit cleaner
80:13 - you can see how we've we've done that
80:16 - we're able to remove a line here two
80:20 - lines here and then of course the few
80:22 - lines down at the bottom where we have
80:23 - all our closing brackets and parentheses
80:25 - so I just cleaned it up a bit so
80:32 - hopefully it's easier to follow with
80:35 - a bit of explanation and let's see -
80:42 - once I actually don't want this margin
80:46 - bottom zero anymore that was also part
80:50 - of trying to make sure that we don't
80:52 - have this overflow that causes a
80:54 - scrollbar so that yeah there we go that
80:59 - added just a bit at the bottom which is
81:02 - nice it actually could it could do with
81:05 - a bit more here at the bottom I'm not
81:07 - really gonna mess with it now I think
81:08 - it's it looks fine
81:12 - great okay so we have our actually see
81:16 - this this is not really small again what
81:20 - happened to our flow text
81:29 - who
81:37 - for some reason our float X is not
81:40 - getting applied how how it was that's
81:50 - odd cuz here this time it actually is
81:54 - showing that floats X is getting applied
81:57 - which is different than what it was
81:59 - before but for some reason right like
82:04 - this font size should be closer to 40
82:07 - for an h2
82:17 - hmm all right well I'm gonna have to
82:22 - check that out later because our our
82:24 - timer is up and I'm probably going to
82:31 - depending on how long the question
82:32 - answer session is I may finish this up
82:35 - and commit this we'll see hopefully I
82:38 - can I can get the right videos in here
82:42 - at least and the right headers and yeah
82:50 - that'll be good for the for the rest of
82:51 - the day I'm gonna try to get this
82:53 - finished for now I'm gonna go over to
82:56 - the live chat I'm gonna answer the
82:57 - questions if you're just here for the
82:59 - coding that portion of the stream is
83:02 - over
83:03 - so if you need to de quit watching now
83:06 - totally understand thank you for
83:09 - watching and you know come back again
83:12 - some other time I should be doing a
83:14 - stream again tomorrow and mostly every
83:18 - weekday around 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time
83:21 - if you can stick around and you have any
83:24 - questions please put them in the live
83:26 - chat now if for some reason you can't
83:29 - put them in the live chat or you can't
83:31 - stick around to hear the answer you can
83:32 - also send them to me on Twitter either
83:35 - an or a tweet or a direct message or in
83:38 - any other social media that you like I'm
83:42 - pretty flexible whatever your favorite
83:44 - is just find me on it and message me
83:46 - there alright so I'm going to get to it
83:49 - I'm scrolling back up to where we left
83:51 - off the last time I checked the live
83:54 - chat and I'm just going to go down
83:55 - through and try to get get to as many
83:58 - questions as I can
84:15 - all right see
84:38 - okay kevin has a great idea so kevin
84:42 - says we should do a contribute MD that
84:45 - says the steps to prepare your
84:46 - environment to work in the repo so
84:49 - install get note clone the repo npm
84:51 - install NPM start but very detailed
84:53 - that's a really good idea so I've
84:57 - actually I've thought before at various
85:02 - times that I should do that because well
85:06 - before I started doing the videos I
85:08 - thought it'd be a good idea because I
85:10 - would like to get some interns or
85:13 - student workers in here I'd really like
85:15 - to help the computer science students to
85:18 - get some real experience and some
85:21 - projects for their portfolio but a lot
85:24 - of them have no idea how to use git or
85:27 - github or NPM or any of that stuff they
85:29 - just they don't do that in any other
85:30 - classes so anyway I think it's a great
85:33 - idea and if I thought it would be useful
85:37 - before this but now that you know we're
85:40 - really working on these projects
85:41 - together with all of you watching now
85:43 - what makes even more sense to do that so
85:47 - I will try I'm gonna put that on my
85:51 - Trello board I'm gonna do that right now
85:53 - so I don't forget that's also something
85:57 - that if if any of you like writing out
86:01 - like technical this would I guess be a
86:04 - bit of documentation if you like doing
86:06 - that then please feel free to to do that
86:12 - that I imagine it would be the type of
86:14 - thing that would be changed and made
86:18 - better and more comprehensive as time
86:21 - goes on so but to start with something
86:23 - just very basic would be better than
86:25 - nothing to help people out so anyway
86:29 - I'll put it on my list to do if any of
86:32 - you you're interested and want to get to
86:34 - it before I get a chance to then that's
86:36 - awesome so let's say I'm actually I'm
86:39 - gonna copy and paste exactly what you
86:42 - would you put in here Kevin cuz I don't
86:47 - think I could put it any better than
86:48 - that
86:48 - understood
86:53 - and I'm gonna give myself maybe like two
87:01 - Pomodoro sessions and this is just to
87:05 - get something there to start out with if
87:07 - I was trying to make it really good I
87:10 - would give myself more time but for now
87:13 - just to get it started I don't want to
87:16 - put a big number here and intimidate
87:17 - myself and then I'll never do it
87:20 - so anyways there I won't forget it by
87:25 - the way if any of you want to check out
87:26 - this Trello board that I'm using to kind
87:29 - of keep track of this project the link
87:32 - is in the description let's see so
87:38 - anyway thanks Kevin
87:39 - for mentioning that
87:52 - okay let's see
87:59 - okay cool it looks like refactored
88:02 - genetic hard cool Patrick just linked
88:06 - just about the the card server some
88:13 - refactoring there which that's awesome
88:15 - so check that up okay cool let me bring
88:24 - this over
88:28 - so anyway awesome thank you this is that
88:37 - that card that we just made but cleaned
88:39 - up so this is like I was saying to make
88:44 - all this card stuff into a constant and
88:47 - then that way and our actual you know
88:50 - return here see how much more clean that
88:54 - is right that's instead of having all of
89:00 - this in there twice right now we just we
89:04 - just have this really so much more clean
89:09 - thank you
89:22 - okay there's some stuff with so for the
89:26 - Instagram profile let's say there's some
89:28 - confusion so I'm looking at it on an
89:32 - Android app so I don't know if the iOS
89:34 - app is is very different but like when I
89:38 - go to a profile if somebody has a live
89:42 - stream or a recording of a live stream
89:44 - up there's a little icon it looks like
89:46 - the YouTube icon and a ring that's kind
89:51 - of like red purple it changes colors a
89:56 - bit around the users profile picture so
90:01 - if you click that then you'll be able to
90:03 - see it so there's no there's no text or
90:06 - anything like that it's just that ring
90:08 - around the around the profile that lets
90:11 - you know that there's something to see
90:31 - okay I just see Sebastian was saying
90:38 - that I do not need the parentheses if
90:42 - I'm just throwing the arrow function
90:44 - right so let's see what time it is yeah
90:49 - oh and that's since I'm not passing
90:56 - anything in I don't need that oh cool so
91:08 - I'm Bert Oh
91:10 - actually I'm Berto asked does float X go
91:14 - on the div as in float X h2 yeah that's
91:19 - actually a good point let's try to put
91:25 - flow text up up here oops and then I can
91:32 - get rid of this completely let's see if
91:38 - that makes a difference all right cool
91:41 - great job Humberto catching that so
91:44 - evidently flow text does not work if you
91:48 - put it directly on the div which how did
91:52 - it I thought it did something to that
91:54 - age three maybe I'm just I don't know
91:58 - maybe my lies are just being fooled
92:02 - there and in doing let's see okay yeah I
92:05 - guess not I actually kind of liked that
92:08 - better when it was a smaller so like
92:13 - this the font weight was lower but I can
92:17 - change that later awesome okay so good
92:24 - to keep in mind you can't use float X on
92:27 - the h2 which is interesting I you can
92:30 - use float X on P tag and it will work
92:33 - but evidently in the H tag it does not
92:36 - work cool
92:41 - Joseph says hi Jesse just want to let
92:44 - you know that I love to to hear you and
92:47 - listen awesome
92:49 - I'm glad glad you enjoy listening to the
92:52 - stream thanks for saying that that
92:55 - really means a lot to me so all the the
92:59 - positive comments really mean a lot so I
93:01 - actually recently I've had not a lot of
93:05 - comments but a few comments basically
93:07 - saying Jesse you talk too much just code
93:10 - and don't talk so which my first
93:16 - reaction is usually like just just now
93:18 - which is kind of to laugh at it but
93:23 - that's about like the extent of the
93:25 - negative comments that I've gotten which
93:27 - I feel really lucky about that but
93:30 - anyway my point is like the positive
93:32 - comments really really mean a lot and
93:34 - they counteract any like somewhat
93:36 - negative comments in terms of just my
93:39 - morale and my desire to keep doing this
93:42 - so anyway I really appreciate that thank
93:47 - you
93:58 - oh cool when I'm bear testers a hundred
94:00 - percent agree with us his comment oh
94:02 - thanks I'm bear to appreciate that
94:04 - oh cool Patrick has submitted a pool
94:10 - request for the gist that is it still up
94:15 - here yeah yeah yeah awesome that's cool
94:21 - actually I I was hoping that you would
94:23 - do that because I mean obviously I could
94:26 - have just copy and pasted this in but
94:27 - then you wouldn't know if it wouldn't
94:29 - have been credited to you it would have
94:31 - been my commit so I'm glad that you're
94:32 - gonna do that and then you know it'll be
94:35 - on record for all time that you
94:36 - submitted that and that was your work
94:38 - and I liked it better like that that
94:41 - you'll have credit for it
94:47 - cool alright so I've gotten to the end
94:53 - of the live chat which that's cool not
94:55 - really a whole lot of questions today
94:56 - which sometimes that happens not really
94:59 - sure what what causes is sometimes we
95:05 - just have like a never-ending list of
95:07 - questions and sometimes it's it's almost
95:09 - nothing but it's good today because I
95:12 - didn't want to do a long stream anyway
95:14 - so we're about it a little over an hour
95:17 - and a half with the streams end up being
95:18 - a decent decent length of stream anyway
95:21 - so tomorrow I should be able to stream
95:25 - at the same time I'm actually I'm gonna
95:29 - check my calendar on my other screen
95:30 - really quickly so I can give you a more
95:32 - accurate let's see yeah I don't I don't
95:36 - have anything on my schedule right now
95:38 - so it should be 2:00 p.m. tomorrow I'll
95:40 - put out a tweet about it and I'll try to
95:43 - schedule it as early as I can tomorrow
95:44 - morning
95:45 - wait a second no tomorrow I'm not at
95:50 - work sorry
95:55 - I don't know what I was thinking
95:56 - tomorrow I'm not working so tomorrow
95:59 - there's no stream I'll be back on
96:01 - Wednesday and it should be a normal
96:03 - frame so one of the perks of working at
96:06 - a Catholic University is that we get
96:09 - extra holidays
96:10 - there are these Catholic holy days that
96:12 - we get off that no one else really gets
96:15 - off so tomorrow I don't work because
96:18 - it's the Feast of the Assumption so I
96:23 - don't have to work tomorrow so that's
96:26 - cool I'll get to hang out with my kids
96:28 - but I won't get to hang out with all of
96:31 - you which is a slight letdown for me but
96:35 - I'll be back on Wednesday and oh I had
96:41 - to add a few more things let me read the
96:43 - last few comments here
96:48 - Joseph says I think 10 positive comments
96:50 - will erase one negative comment in your
96:52 - memory yeah it's like that unfortunately
96:55 - that seems like it is it seems like the
96:57 - negative comments stick in your mind
96:59 - more I really try to fight against that
97:01 - though and stay positive about it so
97:04 - hopefully my ratios a little bit better
97:06 - than 10 to 1 but yeah that's that is how
97:11 - it how it is so I really appreciate all
97:14 - the positive comments and umberto says
97:17 - wait tomorrow's a holy day of obligation
97:18 - yes it is tomorrow is a holy day of
97:21 - obligation these things too Tuesday I
97:24 - don't really know it might depend on
97:27 - your particular diocese and whether or
97:30 - not they move it but since it's a
97:32 - Tuesday I doubt it would get moved like
97:36 - to the nearest Sunday so anyway so yeah
97:41 - if you do happen to be Catholic
97:42 - tomorrow's a holy day of obligation so
97:47 - Catholics are supposed to attend Mass on
97:50 - that day
97:51 - but I think that's that's it that's all
97:57 - I have so anyway and enjoy enjoy your
98:02 - break from the livestream tomorrow
98:05 - and I'll try to enjoy and have a good
98:07 - time with my family as well and thank
98:11 - you so much for all your help and all
98:14 - your encouragement and the live chat
98:16 - really appreciate that and I'll be back
98:21 - Wednesday most likely same time 2 p.m.
98:25 - Eastern thanks again and have a great
98:29 - have a great two days
