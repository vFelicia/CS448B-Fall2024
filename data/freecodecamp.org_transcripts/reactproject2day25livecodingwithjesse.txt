00:06 - hey everybody's Jessie and today we're
00:11 - gonna do some security work for our file
00:16 - uploader so we we built the uploader
00:19 - using node and we didn't even do any
00:23 - type of security at first we just got it
00:25 - working and left it alone for a while
00:27 - now I want to go back to it and I want
00:31 - to white make a whitelist for the
00:33 - different file types that were in accept
00:35 - set a maximum file size and we'll see
00:41 - what else we could put on here that's
00:42 - that's reasonable
00:44 - for for security and if you all have any
00:47 - suggestions or experience with node and
00:51 - file uploads let me know you can check
00:55 - out the code our server dot J's file in
01:01 - the repository the link is in the
01:04 - description so I've changed it slightly
01:08 - from from what's in the repo so I
01:11 - haven't committed any of this yet I'm
01:13 - doing this all on a separate branch and
01:17 - what's the name the file type check is
01:23 - the branch name so that that branch is
01:27 - committed to the repository but there's
01:30 - a little bit that hasn't been committed
01:32 - yet so you'll be able to see most of
01:35 - this file and I'll show you the parts
01:37 - that have changed yesterday I mentioned
01:41 - that I was having some trouble with the
01:44 - server and it wasn't working and I had
01:48 - an idea of what it was and it turns out
01:51 - I was actually right about what the
01:54 - problem was I just missed a step so it
01:56 - did have to do with that home page in
01:58 - package.json that was added to give us
02:01 - support for github pages but so what I
02:05 - had done and I mentioned yesterday was I
02:07 - took out that part of package JSON the
02:10 - home page
02:10 - part and then I tried to run the server
02:14 - again well with the step that I missed
02:16 - was building so I didn't rebuild before
02:21 - I've tried to run it so it was still
02:24 - using the old build that had the
02:26 - homepage set from package.json so once I
02:31 - rebuilt after removing it everything
02:34 - works so for now we're gonna leave out
02:37 - that homepage we're getting to the point
02:39 - where we'll probably have a version on a
02:42 - real server soon so we won't we won't
02:47 - need the github pages version when we
02:51 - have that we can just link to that so
02:56 - for now if you I guess if we really
03:00 - wanted to we could probably keep one
03:02 - branch with that in there but I don't
03:05 - know let me know I don't know if
03:07 - anybody's going to the github pages page
03:10 - or not if if a lot of people are using
03:13 - it then maybe I'll make another branch
03:15 - otherwise I'll just wait a little while
03:16 - until I get the server up and running
03:18 - for this all right so I'm gonna check
03:23 - the live chat quickly say hello okay so
03:33 - have a question so Andy says Dee's
03:35 - create react app for all your projects
03:37 - and the answer is no i you i also use
03:42 - next jazz for some projects if I need
03:46 - server-side rendering I use next if I
03:49 - don't need server-side rendering I
03:51 - usually use create react app Ivan create
03:58 - react app I don't really know for sure
04:01 - but it just it seems this is gonna seem
04:06 - weird because it makes a lot of
04:07 - decisions for you but it seems like I
04:09 - have more freedom with create react app
04:11 - in terms of what I want to use like for
04:14 - instance I can use react router Redux
04:18 - I'm sure there's a way to do that with
04:21 - next
04:22 - but next comes with routing new things
04:23 - built-in so I experiment with more
04:28 - things when I use create react app so I
04:31 - don't I'm not sure that that's a great
04:34 - reason to choose one or the other but
04:37 - that's what that's what I've been doing
04:39 - and it's nice to try out different
04:42 - different things
04:48 - alright so Matteo is joining us from
04:54 - from Italy for the first time live
04:57 - welcome it's a I'm glad you could you
04:59 - could join us Brett said first time on
05:02 - the livestream as well awesome so we
05:04 - have at least two first-timers so
05:06 - welcome that's exciting
05:12 - alright so first thing we'll do is let
05:16 - me go over briefly a pull request that
05:19 - we got actually within I think we got it
05:22 - within the last hour and I was able to
05:25 - merge that and that's part of the the
05:29 - master branch now so well we got a lot
05:34 - more so john s is the first time a
05:39 - metamer not sure how to say that is
05:42 - first time to so awesome that's really
05:47 - exciting sometimes I wonder if I said
05:50 - the same people watching or if I do get
05:52 - new people so alright ones first time
05:56 - Christian first time wow this is really
06:00 - cool I'm excited
06:02 - alright so since there's so many
06:04 - first-timers let me take a few seconds
06:06 - just to explain now I'm you may it's
06:10 - maybe your first time live and you may
06:12 - have watched this before so sorry if
06:13 - this is a repeat but the way this this
06:17 - show works so basically you're watching
06:20 - me do my everyday job I'm a front-end
06:22 - developer at a university Sebastian says
06:26 - it's his first time yeah yeah so my goal
06:34 - this is not really a tutorial the
06:36 - goal is just to give you an idea of what
06:37 - things are like for me I don't really
06:39 - know if I have kind of an average
06:42 - experience as a developer or not I've
06:44 - usually worked alone and that's why I
06:47 - kind of felt the need for something like
06:49 - this because I don't really know what
06:51 - it's like for other developers I've
06:53 - always been freelance or now in my
06:56 - current role I'm the only front-end
06:58 - developer there is you know there's one
07:02 - other person that does a lot of
07:04 - development work but we usually work on
07:05 - separate projects so I don't really have
07:09 - a team so I thought it would be cool to
07:12 - just share what I'm doing and it's kind
07:14 - of built into this team now where we
07:17 - have a lot of different people
07:19 - contributing to the project and helping
07:21 - out in the live chat so I try to keep it
07:24 - kind of this as interactive as possible
07:27 - where I take your suggestions and a lot
07:30 - of your suggestions get incorporated I
07:31 - learn a lot from you all hopefully you
07:34 - all can learn something from me or at
07:36 - least learn from my mistakes which I
07:37 - make frequently and I don't obviously
07:41 - it's live I don't edit anything out so
07:44 - the format is I give a little
07:46 - introduction a review pull requests and
07:48 - then we get to the code will code for
07:51 - usually about an hour maybe sometimes
07:53 - more every 25 minutes I take a five
07:56 - minute break to check the live chat and
07:58 - answer questions and then at the end
08:00 - whatever questions are left over I just
08:02 - take that time to answer all the
08:04 - questions usually I can get to all of
08:05 - them
08:07 - it's very rare maybe like two or three
08:09 - times it's happened that I couldn't get
08:11 - to all the questions so so don't worry
08:13 - about putting any questions you have in
08:15 - there be patient if I don't get to them
08:17 - at first though if there's a lot of
08:18 - questions in there I may not get to
08:20 - until the end but I'll do my best to get
08:23 - to get to everything the recording of
08:27 - this will be available on the free code
08:28 - camp Channel
08:29 - just a few minutes after the stream ends
08:33 - ok so I think that's all the normal
08:36 - stuff that that I need to say about the
08:41 - stream so
08:44 - [Applause]
08:45 - I see there are some questions and so
08:48 - I'm gonna get to those I'm gonna start
08:50 - into the code and then I'll get to those
08:53 - on my first break so just tank hang in
08:56 - there a bit also there's a lot of really
08:58 - knowledgeable people in the live chat so
09:00 - sometimes they get to the questions
09:01 - before I do and give great answers
09:03 - better answers than I could could give
09:06 - so make sure you check if you ask you a
09:09 - question you know keep an eye on a live
09:11 - chat and you'll probably get some some
09:13 - really good answers ok so first things
09:18 - first
09:20 - let me just show you this pull request
09:30 - and I'm getting it ready on my other
09:34 - screens and then I'll pull it over ok so
09:42 - this is the pull request we get so Thank
09:43 - You Sebastian and you can see here you
09:46 - can check it out pull request number 53
09:48 - if you want to see the files to change
09:50 - and everything but basically added some
09:53 - padding and we had talked about that
09:57 - maybe last week sometime or earlier I
10:00 - think it was last week at a page title
10:08 - had some consistency with the way we
10:11 - were using map from lodash and corrected
10:17 - my spelling for the SVG and we I wasted
10:25 - so much time because of a typo but if
10:29 - you was it last week yeah so really nice
10:36 - pull request Thank You Sebastian also I
10:40 - forgot to mention this yesterday and I
10:42 - think it'll be really helpful for a lot
10:44 - of you it certainly will be for me and I
10:47 - have no idea how I forgot to mention
10:49 - this because it was so awesome
10:51 - but as kind of a note on the end of the
10:56 - description of Matt's pool request
10:58 - yesterday he added some stuff about
11:01 - Redux he actually made a repository all
11:06 - about it's basically just an example of
11:08 - using redux and it's really well
11:11 - commented so if you're interested in
11:14 - learning Redux check that out you can
11:17 - the links here and I I forked it as well
11:21 - so it's it's on my github profile too
11:26 - but really really cool and useful I had
11:30 - mentioned last week that I was having
11:31 - trouble with Redux on the Udacity react
11:35 - nanodegree course and Matt last week had
11:40 - said it had offered to help and then
11:43 - without me even asking just provided so
11:47 - much so I really appreciate that and I
11:50 - haven't had time to work on that course
11:52 - yet but I'm gonna work on it probably at
11:56 - some point this week hopefully I'll have
11:58 - some time on the weekend as well and I'm
12:01 - definitely going to go through that
12:03 - repository and you know learn as much as
12:06 - I can okay let's get started I do want
12:14 - to apologize to anyone who was watching
12:18 - the Instagram stream yesterday which if
12:22 - you're not familiar with that my on
12:24 - Instagram I have a second stream at the
12:26 - same time as this one and you can see my
12:30 - face if you're interested in that but
12:34 - it's just kind of a like novelty type of
12:37 - fun thing so but anyway I had the wrong
12:41 - camera on so everybody was looking at my
12:44 - desk instead of my face for the first
12:45 - few minutes so sorry about that I just I
12:47 - didn't even notice it until a few
12:49 - minutes in
12:50 - but today the streams good how-to right
12:54 - off the bat alright so here's my here's
13:00 - what I've added so let me show you what
13:06 - I brought in so I brought in
13:08 - this file type package so with this
13:12 - package at least for my understanding
13:14 - what it's supposed to do is read a
13:16 - stream read the just enough of bytes to
13:21 - know what type the file is and so I
13:25 - thought yeah definitely I want that but
13:27 - then I couldn't get it to work probably
13:30 - because I was trying to read files that
13:34 - were not being streamed in then I found
13:38 - on Stack Overflow someone trying to do a
13:40 - similar thing and you can just check
13:43 - right from formidable which is what
13:47 - we're using to handle or form data you
13:51 - can just check the file type now here's
13:53 - the thing I'm not sure about on the
13:55 - formidable documentation it mentions
13:59 - that doing it this way so just getting
14:02 - the file type is not it says it's the
14:09 - file type is it as reported by the
14:12 - client let me see I have the
14:15 - documentation up on my other screen I
14:17 - want to read you with what it says
14:19 - exactly
14:28 - type it says the M IME type of this file
14:33 - according to the uploading client so I
14:38 - wasn't sure what that was saying exactly
14:41 - is the and here was my worry was if that
14:48 - is is that being sent client-side could
14:52 - that be faked would it be more reliable
14:55 - to try to get that file type plug-in
14:57 - working because that's actually reading
15:00 - the bytes of the file instead so let me
15:03 - know what you think about that if you
15:06 - have any experience with that I think
15:08 - I'm gonna go with this for now and maybe
15:11 - try to do a little bit more research
15:14 - I've already read through a lot of stuff
15:17 - without without really finding a
15:20 - definitive answer but for now I'll I'll
15:25 - try this out and hopefully this works
15:31 - and you know I don't want I'm not like
15:39 - really really worried about malicious
15:42 - files and things
15:43 - I mean I'm reasonably worried about it
15:46 - but it wouldn't be the end of the world
15:47 - this is going to be on its own separate
15:49 - server not connected to anything else
15:51 - that has to do with any of our sites or
15:53 - databases or anything so even if it were
15:56 - to happen which I'm gonna try my best to
15:58 - make sure it doesn't happen
15:59 - but even if something were to happen
16:01 - it's going to be contained which is good
16:05 - but I'd still like to do it the best way
16:07 - possible if I can so if you know of any
16:13 - resources that I can use to learn more
16:15 - about this you know please please let me
16:19 - know alright so we're going to go along
16:21 - with with this so right before I started
16:25 - this dream I just added this in here
16:29 - from the stack overflow question and
16:33 - what I'm doing is I've just created a
16:38 - constant called type
16:40 - and actually copied and pasted and say
16:49 - here we go I wanted it to be called file
16:51 - type
16:51 - okay so file type equals this this is
16:54 - from formidable that we can go file dot
16:56 - type now that will give us something
17:00 - like image slash in PNG right jpg
17:05 - something so that that's what it'll
17:07 - it'll give us but I don't want to have
17:10 - to type image slash for everything to
17:12 - check so that's where we're doing the
17:13 - split in the pop so that it returns
17:18 - something like this which is a little
17:22 - bit easier to check so all basically
17:24 - most of this if not all of it
17:29 - well not all of it I did change a bit
17:31 - but most of it is just copy and pasted
17:33 - right from Stack Overflow and for the
17:35 - most part unedited so I figure we'll try
17:39 - it out and I'm gonna upload some files
17:44 - and see if this will actually work
17:47 - basically what we're doing is checking
17:50 - for the file type if it is one of these
17:53 - types then we'll go ahead with this
17:57 - otherwise we'll console.log incorrect
18:02 - file type and we'll also make sure we
18:07 - check the uploads directory to see what
18:13 - is actually been uploaded and let me
18:16 - yeah I definitely want to
18:22 - I want to delete that because that that
18:27 - one's going to be the unsupported file
18:28 - type all right so I've there's not
18:34 - really any sense pulling the the site up
18:38 - on the screen right now because all I'm
18:40 - gonna do is just hit hit the submit
18:43 - button
18:44 - but I'm will look at the output here and
18:49 - this is what we really want to look at
18:53 - so let me make sure I'm uploading
18:55 - something with a different file site
18:59 - alright so I'm just uploading a bunch of
19:01 - things with one dot xcf file whoa an
19:09 - error occurred let's see
19:18 - maybe I didn't hit save
19:20 - I thought I fixed that all right let's
19:24 - hit save and chat again there we go
19:31 - alright so let's see what happened okay
19:37 - so once it got to here its we see it
19:42 - says incorrect file type and then we do
19:47 - we get a message we still got a message
19:49 - that it's uploaded but it should not
19:51 - have actually uploaded that's right and
19:56 - it did not upload so we will have to I
20:01 - guess we could probably change this so
20:08 - that it checks the same thing I'm not
20:14 - sure that it really matters whether or
20:15 - not we have this anyway we're not this
20:19 - is nice for testing but we're not really
20:22 - gonna see this for most of the time so
20:26 - this will probably get removed at some
20:28 - point anyway so I'm not too worried
20:29 - about that right now but we can confirm
20:31 - this is probably too small for most of
20:34 - you to see but there are no dot x CF
20:38 - files in the uploads folder
20:46 - all right and I forgot to start my
20:49 - Pomodoro timer all right I'm gonna do
20:53 - just a ten-minute right now since I
20:56 - forgot to start it and after the ten
20:58 - minutes I'll do my five-minute break and
20:59 - I'll go back to the live chat since
21:02 - we're about 20 minutes in anyway that
21:05 - that'll be close to what it would have
21:08 - been if I would have remembered to start
21:09 - it all right so that's the kind of the
21:18 - first layer that I wanted to do
21:21 - obviously this needs cleaned up we need
21:23 - to add more things to this list just
21:25 - figure out what I want on this list and
21:28 - and add it all I'm sure there's a better
21:33 - way to do it than this this is going to
21:35 - get really long and let's see it would
21:44 - be nice to also do the same type of
21:46 - validation client-side is to let the
21:49 - user know if they're trying to upload a
21:51 - file that's the wrong type so we may not
21:53 - get to that today but I just wanted to
21:55 - mention that that that's that's going to
21:58 - be a good thing to do otherwise people
22:00 - are going to upload a file thinking that
22:02 - it worked
22:03 - and it's not going to work and that
22:06 - could result in some confusion we don't
22:12 - want to rely on the client side stuff we
22:15 - definitely want the server side as well
22:18 - and let's go with let's try to limit the
22:23 - file size now so formidable comes with
22:28 - let me try to find there we go
22:32 - I'm going to bring over the
22:33 - documentation on formidable so we can
22:36 - all make sure we're all looking at the
22:37 - same thing so
22:41 - sighs so this we can get the file size
22:50 - right from here there's also an option
22:57 - so we can also limit the fields side so
23:08 - I'm not I guess I'm not super worried
23:11 - about the fields but there's already a
23:14 - default max in here so I'm not gonna
23:17 - change this right now I'm okay with this
23:20 - default max right and this says accept
23:23 - file so this doesn't really have
23:24 - anything to do with the files it's just
23:25 - the fields so the defaults fine but what
23:33 - we want to do is check the file size and
23:36 - then reject any files let me think what
23:41 - a reasonable sizes I'll just put just
23:48 - any size in there for now just to test
23:50 - it make sure you have it working and
23:52 - then I'm gonna check to see what what
23:56 - size limit I have in place currently for
23:59 - the the older version of this that's
24:02 - live right now and I'll probably stick
24:05 - with the same size limitation since you
24:09 - know users are already familiar with
24:12 - that the other thing that I'll mention
24:18 - why well it's in my head is we're gonna
24:21 - want to change the file names so as far
24:28 - as I understand security wise the reason
24:32 - you'd want to change the file names is
24:35 - potentially so like we want users to be
24:38 - able to access these files right so I
24:40 - want people I want to be able to access
24:44 - the files on people in my department to
24:45 - be able to access the files on the
24:47 - server by the link in case for some
24:49 - reason the files don't get transferred
24:51 - over to our project management system so
24:56 - that folder where the files are is going
25:00 - to be accessible so I don't want
25:01 - somebody uploading something and then
25:04 - trying to run it so we're going to
25:06 - change the file name alright so they
25:10 - won't they won't be able to just type
25:12 - the file name the day enter in and run
25:14 - it they'll have no idea what the file
25:15 - name is that file name is going to get
25:19 - sent the new file name will get sent in
25:23 - the email that's going to go to our
25:25 - project manager so she'll be able to
25:28 - click on those links the user is going
25:31 - to get sent the old file names just so
25:34 - that they can confirm that those were
25:35 - the files that they intended to send but
25:38 - they're not going to be able to click
25:40 - the link and check their files out so
25:43 - that should you know prevent some
25:46 - malicious activity I suppose and correct
25:50 - me if I'm wrong but that that was my
25:52 - understanding of the benefit of changing
25:55 - file names and I guess there's also a
25:57 - benefit of people not over writing files
26:01 - if they happen to upload a file with the
26:04 - same name it would overwrite the file
26:05 - that was in there so this way files are
26:09 - going to have a unique name and you
26:13 - won't have you know either of the
26:15 - problems that I just mentioned alright
26:18 - but first let's check out where the file
26:20 - size alright so I'm just going to
26:26 - console.log file size just to make sure
26:33 - that it is working
26:37 - I think it will I really don't have any
26:40 - reason to doubt that this would work but
26:45 - rather check it out now okay
26:51 - all right so it's not working in there
26:55 - probably because we have it in file
26:58 - begin let's see
27:15 - all right so we need some other way to
27:18 - check the file size
27:28 - I mean obviously if I put it here then
27:35 - we should get the real file size right
27:41 - so we're getting that here but at that
27:44 - point the files already been uploaded
27:48 - and we want to stop it from even being
27:50 - uploaded
27:59 - it seems like I'm missing something
28:01 - that's really obvious here right there
28:03 - should be a way to limit the file size
28:50 - yeah I think I still have yeah I still
28:53 - have the stackoverflow question where I
28:55 - got the the previous code from as well
28:58 - I'm interested to see how they're
29:01 - handling that
29:12 - so it looks like they're not they're not
29:15 - checking size at all all right let me
29:21 - check the latch act quickly
29:23 - and I'm about to the end anyway so I
29:26 - want to see if anyone's put anything in
29:32 - here about about our problem
30:06 - okay
30:08 - all right so looks like you have some
30:11 - suggestions so thanks John Hanson
30:13 - suggested sanitizing fields and suggest
30:20 - github.com dome purify so I'll check
30:26 - that out thank you for that let me let
30:31 - me go ahead and do my five minutes now
30:32 - so we'll take a break from the code for
30:35 - five minutes and I'm going to answer
30:36 - questions in the live chat then we'll
30:39 - come back and try to figure out what to
30:44 - do about this file size and actually
30:52 - maybe I'll explain when we come back
30:54 - I'll explain a little bit about how
30:57 - we're uploading files in the first place
30:59 - because if you didn't catch the the
31:02 - episode whenever we did that then you
31:05 - may may be a little bit confused if
31:08 - you've never handled file uploads and
31:09 - node
31:21 - makalah says I'm of you I'm a huge a s
31:24 - user but I like Jesse that's cool I
31:27 - really I appreciate you saying that
31:31 - that's cool
31:46 - Christian says this is pretty nice thank
31:48 - you
31:49 - thank you I appreciate you saying that I
31:56 - Abdul Azeez says I joined free code camp
31:59 - last week and I'm excited awesome
32:02 - awesome
32:03 - glad you glad you joined I hope you're
32:06 - making it through the the exercises and
32:10 - everything and feel free to ask any
32:12 - questions
32:21 - Christian says the idea about the team
32:24 - sounds fantastic yeah I actually the
32:29 - team thing came as kind of a surprise to
32:33 - me so well the first thing was I didn't
32:36 - know if anybody would even want to watch
32:37 - this at all
32:39 - and the first week or so I had there
32:42 - were maybe like two streams where I had
32:45 - no one watched at all and then I had
32:47 - just maybe like one or two people that
32:49 - watched consistently and then whenever I
32:53 - got invited to do this for the free code
32:55 - camp Channel I got a lot more viewers
32:57 - you know just because of how well-known
33:00 - free code camp is at that point it
33:03 - really started it started to pick up and
33:06 - feel more like a team when people
33:09 - started contributing to the project both
33:11 - from pool requests and from suggestions
33:13 - and the live chat from you know messages
33:16 - on Twitter and things so now that team
33:19 - is just kind of grown and yeah I can't
33:23 - take credit for planning that at all it
33:25 - just it happened it's been it's been
33:28 - great and I've learned so much from the
33:33 - suggestions and all the code that has
33:35 - been contributed because obviously I go
33:38 - through it all I can't just merge stuff
33:40 - in without looking at it and to get when
33:43 - I go through it all I have to try my
33:44 - best to understand it all as well so I
33:47 - know my my coding has gotten at least I
33:51 - think it's gotten a lot better maybe one
33:53 - day I'll go back and
33:54 - watch some of the first dreams and
33:55 - compare and maybe you all have seen some
33:59 - sort of change if you've been watching
34:00 - from the beginning but yeah that's been
34:04 - a really really pleasant surprise
34:07 - having you know this community now
34:16 - Sergey asks what do you think about
34:19 - react Redux and rxjs I I like them
34:28 - i I think I really enjoy working with
34:37 - react Redux is confusing to me at this
34:40 - point I guess the big picture concepts
34:43 - of Redux are not that confusing like I
34:46 - get the flow of everything but the
34:49 - actual implementation of particularly
34:53 - trying to get data from an API and then
34:56 - put it in the component right now I'm
34:58 - getting the problem where my components
35:03 - are rendering before the data comes in
35:05 - and then they don't they don't ever get
35:09 - the correct data so I'm missing
35:12 - something somewhere along the way so I
35:14 - don't know if it's in my reducers or my
35:17 - actions or what so that's just kind of
35:21 - the the thing that I'm working with
35:23 - right now that's confusing to me I'm not
35:25 - really sure you know how to troubleshoot
35:27 - and the best way to go about that so I'm
35:30 - not to that point I think at least for
35:33 - me when I work with something new a lot
35:36 - of what I'm doing at first is just
35:38 - trying to adapt what other people have
35:40 - done without fully understanding
35:41 - everything after you work with it for a
35:44 - long time is after I work with it for a
35:46 - long time I get to the point where I can
35:48 - start doing my own thing more at that
35:52 - point then it's it gets a lot easier
35:56 - when something goes wrong but I'm at
35:58 - that first stage right now where since I
36:01 - don't fully understand everything when
36:04 - something goes wrong then
36:06 - it's really hard to figure out why it
36:08 - went wrong and sometimes you know I'll
36:11 - change something without even realizing
36:14 - you know what it does but I mean that's
36:17 - how you learn it's just it's this second
36:22 - project for the Udacity course is taking
36:24 - a lot longer than I had hoped it would
36:26 - take just because of that because of
36:28 - having to troubleshoot what I'm doing
36:30 - with Redux so anyway don't know how
36:33 - great of an answer that was to your
36:35 - question but let's just I guess a little
36:37 - bit of what I think about react and
36:41 - redux all right so I'm gonna go back to
36:49 - the code now I didn't make it through
36:51 - everything that's currently in the live
36:52 - chat but I'll come back to it I'm
36:55 - actually I'm gonna write down the
36:56 - timestamp for where I left off
36:59 - so I don't forget and I'll be able to
37:02 - get back to it more quickly on our next
37:05 - break so let me start up our 25 minute
37:08 - timer and as I mentioned a few minutes
37:12 - ago let me just take a moment just to go
37:16 - through what what we're doing so we have
37:23 - a form so we have this form and when we
37:28 - hit submit the form goes to our uploads
37:38 - path and so everything within so we're
37:42 - using Express so we're using nodejs
37:47 - right which is JavaScript running on the
37:49 - server side we're using Express with
37:52 - that okay and a bunch of other stuff to
37:54 - help us make handling forms easier so in
37:59 - particular formidable we're doing some
38:02 - things with that so we're using send
38:05 - grid to send mail okay but you know
38:09 - basically the main thing we're doing is
38:12 - we're listening for for that uploads
38:19 - let me see where it's at I lost it for
38:22 - when something comes in to that uploads
38:25 - directory and then we're going to do
38:29 - some stuff if that happens so in
38:31 - particular we're using formidable to
38:35 - handle that form data all right so that
38:38 - that helps take care of some things for
38:40 - us and then well particularly what we're
38:47 - working on right now is what do we do
38:49 - with the files so on file begins so when
38:54 - we varied the first time we start to get
38:56 - a file and we're uploading it right to
39:03 - our upload directory with with a certain
39:06 - file name and right now we're just
39:07 - keeping the same name and and that's our
39:12 - file uploader basically so that's what
39:14 - we started with and it works I mean down
39:16 - here we're just console logging the file
39:17 - name down here we're making an array of
39:22 - the files because we use that later on
39:25 - when we want to send things to different
39:27 - places so we're this is where we're
39:32 - getting all the values of all the other
39:35 - inputs and we're creating a string out
39:42 - of all those inputs and adding breaks in
39:45 - between it and then that way we can send
39:46 - this data in a more readable format and
39:50 - then down here we're doing some sending
39:56 - emails right so we're sending that
39:59 - string and we're also sending file names
40:02 - and then we're also sending some things
40:05 - to our project management system which
40:08 - is called rike so we're sending that
40:11 - same data that we send the email but in
40:13 - addition we're also sending the actual
40:15 - files so that's pretty much everything
40:19 - that's going on in our server dot J's
40:24 - file so if you haven't seen one of these
40:27 - or worked with one before I said what it
40:29 - might look confusing it is it's
40:31 - JavaScript
40:33 - and it's using a lot of different
40:35 - packages from from NPM but you know the
40:38 - basics of what's going on I think it or
40:41 - not it's not that hard to understand so
40:46 - hopefully you know that was a decent
40:48 - overview for you to understand the
40:52 - context of what we're doing and now
40:56 - we'll get back to ok file size that's
41:00 - what we want so we tried putting getting
41:07 - the file size on file begin that's not
41:09 - gonna work because the file has just
41:11 - begun being loaded being uploaded and
41:15 - it's showing up as zero what we want is
41:19 - to get the file size let's see
41:32 - let's get the fuss re I just I just got
41:35 - distracted I looked over at the lab chat
41:37 - and saw someone Christian s are you in
41:40 - are you Jesse in San Francisco I am NOT
41:45 - in San Francisco I am in Ohio right now
41:47 - house quite far away from San Francisco
41:52 - but I like San Francisco it's a really
41:55 - nice City I like that there are very few
41:58 - traffic lights and a lot of stop signs I
42:01 - think that's really cool and all the
42:04 - streets are in like an alphabetical grid
42:06 - and in numbered so you really can't get
42:09 - lost there's a lot of other really cool
42:13 - things about San Francisco but I just I
42:16 - that was just really cool to me anyway I
42:23 - guess I'm gonna have to do some some
42:27 - googling here quickly see
42:39 - all right so here's my I don't know if
42:42 - you actually want to see my googling but
42:44 - just in case here it is so not bad we
42:50 - got some stuff it's pretty old so let's
42:53 - go for past year so cynical edition okay
43:02 - yeah this is yeah this is what I want
43:10 - looks like some people are using jQuery
43:14 - I don't want jQuery we're not using
43:18 - jQuery all right well let's see what we
43:22 - have these first two
43:35 - I mean I'd rather this is all client
43:39 - side of course I think we should have a
43:44 - client side check but I'd rather have
43:49 - both the server side and client side
43:52 - check yeah so maybe I should be more
43:55 - specific in node
44:42 - okay this see so we are we we are we do
44:47 - have FS already
45:12 - okay so this person is trying to do the
45:15 - same thing that I want to do want to
45:19 - check it without actually uploading it
45:24 - the state class will not upload the file
45:27 - as I think all right well let's check
45:32 - that documentation then all right so
45:39 - we're checking the documentation for
45:44 - getting the file size
46:02 - mmm
46:45 - all right yes we can try this
46:47 - [Applause]
47:00 - all right so let's see what what did
47:12 - all right I'm gonna move this over to my
47:15 - other screen so I can keep looking at it
47:17 - while we
47:25 - while we test it out
47:50 - all right let me see someone just asked
47:57 - in a live chat to see the website so
48:01 - here's the at least one page in the site
48:08 - I'm eating some suggestions here and the
48:13 - live chat so let me check them out
48:28 - oh okay so Brett's saying to use the on
48:34 - progress and and check it like that okay
48:41 - cool
48:44 - hey Phillip how's it going - Phillips in
48:47 - the live chat says it's been a while
48:51 - yeah it's been a while hopefully
48:53 - everything is going well with you
48:55 - welcome back
49:05 - alright so that's always formidable here
49:11 - we go alright so let me show you what I
49:15 - think it's down here what we're talking
49:18 - about okay so we were checking this
49:27 - we're gonna use this to check on our
49:32 - file size and see how we're gonna do
49:36 - this
49:37 - well let's copy it first and play around
49:40 - with it okay
50:04 - alright let's just put this in here for
50:06 - now and let's console.log
50:51 - all right so let's just check out what
50:54 - we get when we do this so this should
50:59 - the documentation says for each chunk of
51:02 - data that's downloaded this should give
51:05 - us values okay so submit that awesome
51:20 - all right great so we are getting
51:24 - received and expected nice so really as
51:39 - long as we know the expected I guess we
51:47 - could roll right away we could rule out
51:49 - a file if the expected amount of data is
51:51 - more than our cap and then we did
51:54 - further check it to make sure that the
51:58 - received amount of data is under the cap
52:00 - so I don't know if it's possible but
52:03 - maybe the expected data it could be
52:07 - incorrect and file the real file size is
52:10 - much bigger so I can see value in
52:13 - checking both
52:22 - all right awesome so thank you Brett
52:26 - that was definitely what we needed all
52:28 - right so now let's just figure out how
52:30 - we're going to hook this up into what
52:33 - we're currently doing the the easiest
52:38 - thing would just be to put this this
52:40 - form on right in here I don't really
52:45 - think that'll work but it's it's such an
52:47 - easy thing that I think it's worthwhile
52:50 - to just try it even though I have just
52:54 - really small hopes of it actually
52:55 - working but let's give it a shot hey
53:03 - well we didn't get an error there which
53:04 - is nice
53:13 - that's interesting it did it actually
53:17 - work
53:18 - I was compared mm-hmm
53:36 - okay
53:40 - maybe that did work
53:48 - I I did not think it would work but if
53:53 - it did that's great
53:57 - see so it's always worthwhile to just
54:00 - try something especially if it if it
54:04 - doesn't really take that long to test it
54:06 - and know if it works or not all right so
54:08 - I think this works just like this which
54:12 - makes it a lot easier so what we can do
54:16 - then is now obviously there's always
54:21 - time to refactor so if you're looking at
54:24 - my code during this and thinking like
54:27 - what is he doing
54:29 - certainly I'm definitely I'm open for
54:33 - well number one for me refactoring but
54:36 - also if anybody else really wants to
54:38 - refactor you know this is available on
54:41 - github for pool requests and I
54:43 - appreciate that so for now I guess I'll
54:48 - leave this logs in and let's put let's
54:58 - see
55:05 - if bytes expected or just I don't know
55:13 - what we want to set the limit as I want
55:17 - some of these to not go through so
55:27 - respected it's greater than just cut
55:33 - this down oops
55:37 - I'm here or fights received
56:00 - then we will actually upload and let's
56:10 - also
56:16 - [Music]
56:18 - yeah we'll be able to see what gets
56:20 - uploaded so let's save that and deletes
56:26 - I think we can just delete let's delete
56:37 - everything out of here then it'll be
56:40 - really obvious what makes it in whoa so
56:47 - [Music]
56:51 - there we go
56:53 - okay all right so everything's deleted
56:57 - now and we'll be able to see what gets
57:05 - uploaded let me see it may not upload
57:12 - anything I'm not sure what all these
57:16 - sizes are but yeah let's see
57:32 - actually not I'm looking at this
57:45 - it's really odd that each one of these
57:47 - files is exactly the same size that
57:49 - makes me think that something's wrong so
57:54 - let's give it a shot
58:06 - okay it's alright cool so nothing was
58:09 - uploaded which is what we expected I
58:11 - definitely want to see though what size
58:14 - these files really are
58:25 - so I'm gonna try to find these files see
58:32 - which ones are trying to upload activity
58:36 - for
58:47 - yeah something's wrong because these
58:50 - files are definitely different sizes
59:05 - all right so what's going on
59:12 - so even when we had it let's
59:15 - double-check back to this the first time
59:31 - I want to check the first time we had
59:33 - this where it was outside of the other
59:37 - function
59:45 - there we go all right so we had for that
59:50 - first file 21 okay so it was already
59:55 - happening then
60:04 - hmm
60:15 - all right
60:23 - let me think about this I'm not exactly
60:28 - sure what the problem is
60:38 - it's which which should be happening
60:49 - it's this let's let's look at the
60:53 - documentation it doesn't say much about
60:55 - it I did it doesn't say that this is for
61:07 - every file individually is it possible
61:13 - that this is for everything in the form
61:16 - being sent
61:33 - yes
61:46 - all right well I know I guess we can
61:48 - test this let's remove one of these
61:52 - files so we're gonna go from day for to
61:58 - day seven instead of day eight now if it
62:03 - was giving us the total of all of this
62:06 - it should be different right otherwise
62:09 - if it's something else going on
62:11 - like for instance maybe it's just
62:13 - telling us the value for this first one
62:16 - over and over again then it should still
62:19 - be the same
62:27 - all right
62:29 - okay all right so we got a different
62:32 - value now all right I do want to test
62:40 - one thing and my test was a bit flawed
62:41 - so on the off chance that it was
62:43 - actually giving us the value of the last
62:45 - one over and over again let's do it
62:47 - again where we take the first one off
62:49 - but keep the last one and see what we
62:51 - get
63:02 - okay and that's a different value as
63:05 - well so what what it seems like is
63:11 - happening is that this is not this is
63:19 - not the value
63:25 - I mean
63:34 - yeah this makes sense yeah I think this
63:41 - is giving us the total bytes received
63:43 - not per file if you notice and I didn't
63:46 - notice this before is that this this
63:49 - number keeps going up even regardless of
63:54 - what's being said here when this file
63:56 - actually it's uploaded it just keeps
63:57 - going up and up and up so at first I
64:01 - thought for some reason that it was
64:02 - restarting every time and I just was not
64:05 - paying enough attention but this is
64:09 - giving us the total for everything if
64:19 - that's the best we can do that's not
64:21 - terrible we could just set a max which I
64:27 - mean how would that be different than
64:29 - setting a limit to the number of files
64:31 - and then a max per file it really
64:35 - wouldn't be I guess it doesn't
64:40 - necessarily matter one way or another
64:42 - you know if we set a one megabyte limit
64:45 - and a 10 file limit or if we just set a
64:47 - 10 megabyte total limit it still still
64:52 - gonna be the same I guess it would be
64:56 - less confusing to the user if we could
64:58 - set a per file limit but if we can't
65:05 - this will still work so my timer did go
65:08 - off that was a really fast 25 minutes so
65:11 - let me go back to the live chat and I
65:17 - will scroll up to
65:26 - let's see
65:31 - I'm going to scroll up to the point in
65:34 - the live chat we're in Eastern time it
65:36 - was eight minutes after two so I'm about
65:41 - an hour behind in a live chat and let's
65:45 - try to answer some more questions
65:58 - Brett says learned yarn from you Jesse
66:01 - awesome cool although now people were
66:03 - telling me to use the latest version of
66:05 - NPM instead of yarn but I've seen mixed
66:08 - things about that some people were
66:09 - saying yarn is still faster I don't
66:11 - really know I probably won't change for
66:13 - this project I'm used to the yarn
66:17 - commands now so maybe for a future
66:19 - project I'll try it
66:24 - Igor's asks what's the point of this app
66:28 - basically the main point of the app is
66:30 - to allow users to submit requests for
66:34 - work to my department so I work in the
66:37 - marketing department and we do a lot of
66:39 - different things both print design and
66:42 - writing and videos photography and
66:49 - websites so people will be able to use
66:53 - this form it'll send all the data
66:56 - directly to our project management
66:58 - system and from there our project
67:01 - manager can assign the project to the
67:04 - the correct people it's also a resource
67:10 - where people can download things so
67:13 - logos university logos and the the guide
67:21 - for for writing I guess there's a
67:25 - writing guide for official guidelines
67:27 - for university correspondence and things
67:29 - so there's some other things as well
67:32 - there
67:41 - oh it seems the audio was cutting out
67:44 - for Mandela effect conference so it
67:50 - looks like it's not cutting out for
67:52 - anybody else so I'm guessing then it's
67:55 - not something on my end so sorry about
67:57 - that I'm not really sure if I could do
67:59 - anything about it
68:07 - get success boy you've made me love
68:10 - coding love you brother I'm pretty
68:12 - grateful to you oh that's awesome thank
68:14 - you so much for saying that
68:16 - I really really appreciate that that's
68:20 - that's cool I'm glad sometimes I worry
68:23 - that my streams get boring especially
68:25 - when I can't figure out what to do but
68:30 - if I've made you love coding then I must
68:33 - be doing something right so that's
68:36 - awesome
68:55 - it's
69:01 - Brett says Brett was having a
69:03 - conversation with someone else it was
69:05 - also from San Francisco but he mentioned
69:08 - in that conversation that I like Jesse
69:10 - strange because he goes through the
69:12 - bumps in the road yeah my streams are
69:15 - very bumpy sometimes that was the point
69:19 - I I definitely it's intentional that I
69:23 - don't prepare beforehand for two reasons
69:26 - one of them is a very selfish lazy
69:28 - reason and one of them is a useful
69:30 - reason the lazy reason is if I don't
69:34 - prepare beforehand then I don't have to
69:35 - take time to prepare right so it's I can
69:38 - do these videos without without as much
69:41 - work which is kind of necessary if I if
69:44 - I had to pre-record videos and edit and
69:45 - do everything then there's no way I
69:47 - could do this everyday for a couple
69:49 - hours but the the more useful reason at
69:55 - least for all of you is I wanted you all
70:00 - to see what it's like for me and how
70:04 - often I make mistakes and have to work
70:07 - through that because the pre-recorded
70:10 - tutorial videos that are out there are
70:12 - really awesome and I benefited greatly
70:14 - from them but you get the feeling
70:17 - especially when I was starting out you
70:20 - get the feeling like everybody else
70:22 - knows what they're doing and you don't
70:24 - because you you know I messed up a lot
70:26 - and they never mess up and realistically
70:31 - they have time to edit I mean I'm sure
70:33 - that you know five-minute video takes a
70:36 - lot longer than five minutes to do
70:37 - because their mistakes but those get
70:40 - edited out you don't see those so I
70:42 - really wanted you all to be able to see
70:44 - the mistakes so I was a little bit
70:47 - nervous at everyone thinking that I was
70:49 - a noob because I make so many mistakes
70:51 - but I've gotten over that now and in
70:56 - fact no one calls me a noob you are very
71:00 - understanding of the mistakes and I
71:03 - think that's that's part of the
71:07 - uniqueness of this of this stream
71:15 - is uniqueness a word I'm not sure it
71:20 - just sounded weird when I said it okay
71:37 - I'm gonna I'm actually really close to
71:39 - being at the bottom of the live chat so
71:41 - I'm just going to take another few
71:43 - seconds and look at this if there's any
71:45 - questions before I go back to the code
71:50 - Jordan says hello from Tennessee hey
71:52 - how's it going I've got relatives in
71:56 - Tennessee and who else Patrick Patrick's
71:59 - in Tennessee too right yeah
72:41 - okay I'm glad I looked down because
72:43 - there's a lot in here talking about what
72:46 - was just going on so it seems like you
72:49 - all figured out what was going on before
72:50 - I did
73:03 - that's just great until 2:30 then not so
73:06 - great without sugar yeah that's uh
73:10 - that's kind of what I was getting at
73:12 - when I was talking about refactoring is
73:14 - this better get at it in later sometimes
73:19 - when I'm really trying to do things I
73:21 - just fall back on the very basics of
73:23 - JavaScript just to get it to work
73:26 - because I know I'm comfortable with the
73:29 - basics and I don't want to be
73:31 - troubleshooting for something and it's
73:33 - just me not remembering how to do some
73:35 - es6 thing
74:01 - okay so let me I didn't get through all
74:04 - the questions let's go we'll probably do
74:08 - see what time it is first hmm I think
74:19 - I'll do one more session of coding I'd
74:23 - really like to get this working and then
74:27 - we'll go go back to the live chat and
74:30 - answer questions so let me start this up
74:32 - one more time and let's see so I see
74:38 - Joseph has said there's a max file size
74:43 - option for note formidable incoming form
74:46 - and is that the one we looked at
74:58 - next file size
75:03 - that's all I did not see the max file
75:06 - size option
75:15 - yeah so I'm not seeing the max file size
75:17 - is am I missing it somewhere
75:30 - okay so it's it's not it's not in here
75:33 - yet but is it let's see can I use it
75:38 - let's see
76:22 - is it in there
76:51 - yeah it's definitely in there nice
76:57 - that's awesome
76:59 - Joseph that's amazing so basically in
77:06 - the documentation for formidable it does
77:09 - not say anything about a max file size
77:11 - option but Joseph checked out the actual
77:15 - source code and found it so you can see
77:18 - it here in incoming form so I don't know
77:24 - why I didn't just do this right off the
77:26 - bat but this is really useful to just
77:28 - search an entire repository for
77:29 - something so right here under max field
77:33 - size there's an option for max file size
77:37 - really awesome so this is cool because
77:41 - this means a lot of the stuff that we
77:45 - just tried to do we can just remove and
77:48 - make this so much more simple so we
77:52 - should be able to just follow the
77:55 - implementation for the field size and
77:59 - instead put file size so hopefully
78:07 - that'll work let's try it out oh excuse
78:11 - me host yawning all right let's get rid
78:15 - of a bunch of this stuff
78:25 - it's
78:28 - actually let's keep this and want that
78:31 - stuff
78:40 - okay awesome and where's our
78:48 - documentation imax file size
78:59 - oops actually this way I want to be is
79:02 - to stop there
79:09 - so we should just be able to go form dot
79:11 - max file size let's just copy this and
79:16 - then change it
79:33 - there we go let's put it up here
79:47 - okay cool
79:52 - now let's test this out so actually
80:01 - probably doesn't matter we can just keep
80:04 - could've just kept the ones we had but
80:08 - let's make sure all right so this is
80:10 - empty submit awesome check it out okay
80:18 - and
80:45 - all right I don't think that should have
80:47 - worked maybe let's check the versions
80:56 - were using
81:12 - alright there's the latest version but
81:17 - yes I mean this hasn't been updated in a
81:20 - while so that should be in there
81:38 - hmm
81:41 - all right let me check so Joseph said he
81:43 - saw it in a pull request that had been
81:45 - merged so let me check it out
81:57 - there we go
82:00 - let's check out what they say not much
83:34 - hmm
83:44 - okay so maybe it's a little bit more
83:47 - complicated it looks like
84:15 - it looks like motor actually has better
84:23 - better limits for this
84:30 - I remember I remember we were first
84:33 - looking into this we were trying to
84:36 - decide between these two
85:00 - Hey
85:03 - okay so basically for whatever reason
85:08 - this didn't work when I just did it but
85:12 - even if I can't get it to work it seems
85:16 - like this is not I don't it's not going
85:22 - to be great for security and if the
85:29 - other way that we are doing it might
85:31 - actually be better but if we can do both
85:36 - that would be the best
86:05 - alright let's see I just saw in the live
86:12 - chat ok Joseph said make it really small
86:15 - that's a good idea that'll definitely
86:17 - tell me if it's working or not
86:21 - yeah let's make this really small so how
86:28 - about this that's pretty small all right
86:39 - oops should've deleted these first let's
86:46 - delete them
86:53 - I'm gonna delete all of them
87:00 - there we go all right let's try not oh
87:10 - there there okay yes it's definitely not
87:13 - working
87:25 - keep losing my place
87:36 - hmm
87:45 - that's a
87:58 - okay Brett says the comment said to
88:01 - check the content length in the dark
88:03 - header that would be a way to reject
88:05 - before downloading starts okay just so
88:15 - so I guess says love you Jesse even
88:19 - though you are in your left brain which
88:23 - one's the left I can't remember there's
88:25 - a difference between left and right ones
88:27 - like more creative and but I can't
88:29 - remember which ones which so which one's
88:30 - the left brain supposed to be
88:44 - it's
89:27 - did they also so Brett okay so I guess
89:37 - as left is for logic right is for pure
89:40 - love and creativity
89:54 - yeah oh my creativity I guess I'm I have
89:59 - a little bit of creativity when I'm
90:01 - doing the design stuff I saved most of
90:07 - my creativity for the kitchen I like to
90:10 - cook
90:23 - okay Joseph says checkout issue 324 all
90:27 - right let's do that
91:13 - all right awesome awesome Thank You
91:17 - Joseph I asked if I could talk about
91:28 - myself
91:30 - maybe a little a little bit after this
91:32 - session so in eight minutes I'll talk
91:35 - about myself a little bit if you want to
91:37 - know anything specific ask it now I mean
91:41 - otherwise like I guess a lot you could
91:45 - talk about
92:39 - all right this should not work because
92:44 - when we checked file size and file began
92:46 - it was always zero we can try it again
92:51 - though I mean I'm gonna scroll down
92:53 - obviously this is not the less the last
92:56 - word on this
93:35 - I'm sorry there's there's been a lot of
93:38 - me reading documentation today I know
93:44 - that's probably not very fun to watch I
93:48 - probably should just enter this dream
93:50 - after the last one and read all this
93:52 - stuff on my own
94:16 - oh then area yeah this is what happened
94:20 - to us on file begin the file size is
94:23 - zero Oh
94:34 - swish some water and if we end up having
94:42 - to switch I mean I guess that would be I
94:46 - guess it would be okay but I'd rather
94:50 - not I don't know maybe it wouldn't be a
94:53 - big deal
94:53 - hopefully we can find a different
94:54 - solution now
95:14 - okay so let's check this out
95:27 - I wish this wasn't an image Wow
96:12 - mm-hmm
96:15 - well they have about three minutes since
96:18 - this Pomodoro session is over I don't
96:21 - think that we're gonna get this working
96:26 - in that amount of time
96:52 - all right yeah
96:56 - I think I'll have to read a little bit
96:58 - more try this I'm also gonna look into
97:00 - using a motor see how hard it would be
97:04 - to switch if the switch is easy and we
97:08 - could still do everything we want then
97:10 - it might take less time to just switch
97:12 - than to figure out how to do this
97:16 - especially if it ends up being that the
97:19 - way military does it is more secure than
97:23 - what we would be able to do it was
97:25 - something like this so because this is a
97:32 - lot of code to do what you can do in you
97:35 - know a very short line with mole tears
97:38 - so I have used multi before so I'm not
97:41 - completely unfamiliar with it okay all
97:47 - right well I'm gonna go I'm not really
97:50 - gonna get much done in two minutes so
97:53 - I'm just gonna go back to the live chat
97:55 - and oh well sometimes that happens I
97:58 - really try to get things done but we did
98:01 - at least figure out we figured out a lot
98:05 - of stuff didn't get everything completed
98:07 - but made some good progress on
98:09 - understanding how formidable works and
98:14 - so hopefully I can build on a lot of
98:19 - that and I think thanks for you know
98:24 - everyone helping me out with that and
98:25 - really finding some good stuff in the
98:27 - documentation so let me go I'm gonna
98:32 - scroll up a bit to where I left off
98:36 - and go through some questions so so the
98:40 - coding portion is done for now
98:42 - if you don't want to stick around for
98:44 - the question an answer that's fine thank
98:47 - you so much for watching and tune in
98:50 - again sometime if you can otherwise if
98:54 - you have a question put it in the live
98:55 - chat now I'll do my best to answer it
98:57 - and if if you would rather ask it
99:01 - privately you can direct message me on
99:03 - Twitter or some other social media
99:07 - I'm I'm pretty much on all the the main
99:10 - social media channels okay so what I
99:15 - leave off 312
99:18 - okay so David asks do you have any
99:22 - advice for beginners I'm 16 and want to
99:25 - become a web so I software developer and
99:27 - still deciding whether I need to go to
99:29 - your university or not so let me see so
99:35 - there was one at least one response I
99:38 - can see to that so let me read the
99:39 - response first before I I talked about
99:42 - it so Mandela effect conference says if
99:46 - it is paid paid for go then if you want
99:50 - to try programming take nine hours a
99:52 - semester and go to boot camp and then
99:54 - look for an internship all four years
99:56 - that you were in university yeah so
100:08 - I agree saying that if it's pagan so if
100:12 - you happen to get scholarships or
100:14 - somehow if it's paid for then it might
100:19 - not be a bad idea to go it does somewhat
100:23 - depend on your situation right if for
100:27 - some reason like you really need money
100:30 - now then even if your school is paid for
100:36 - then you still may not be able to afford
100:40 - it right because there's there's other
100:42 - expenses involved that sometimes that
100:44 - don't get paid for and then there's the
100:49 - you know all the time you spend it in
100:51 - your classes you won't be able to work
100:53 - or make money so there could be some
100:56 - situations where even if school is paid
100:58 - for you and want to but in general I
101:00 - would say in majority of situations if
101:02 - it's paid for you may as well do it
101:04 - because it's a huge value and if you if
101:09 - you take like the cost of school into
101:11 - consideration you'd be making more money
101:15 - doing that then you could probably make
101:17 - doing anything else at that point in
101:19 - your life so that said if you have to go
101:25 - into debt to go to school and what you
101:27 - really want to do is be a web developer
101:30 - or a software developer then I don't
101:32 - really recommend going to school going
101:35 - to university I would recommend like
101:38 - while you're already doing free code
101:40 - camp so go through that I've I've read
101:44 - stories of people who've gone through
101:46 - free code camp and gotten jobs really
101:51 - soon afterwards so that's definitely
101:53 - possible I would just say work with free
101:56 - code camp stuff take advantage of all
101:59 - the free resources you can online do
102:02 - freelance work to build up your
102:03 - portfolio and apply to any job that
102:07 - you're interested in just apply don't
102:10 - worry if you don't meet all the
102:12 - qualifications you know
102:13 - know what could happen and so anyway
102:17 - that's my advice I mean you're only 16
102:19 - so you know at this point you're
102:22 - probably in high school so you do have
102:25 - some time to work on things before you
102:27 - really have to decide about college you
102:30 - know at least you know at least a year
102:33 - or two depending on what would grade
102:37 - you're in right now so you could work on
102:40 - your coding and even probably pick up
102:44 - some clients build your portfolio a bit
102:45 - and then you'll probably have a much
102:47 - better idea of of what you really want
102:49 - to do hopefully that's helpful Phillips
102:56 - says your videos are super realistic
102:57 - that's what makes them great yeah this
103:00 - is like legit reality TV here right yeah
103:04 - this is a hundred percent what I
103:09 - actually did the only difference between
103:10 - unknowing now and what I do the rest of
103:13 - the day is that I don't talk to myself
103:15 - in my office when i'm not streaming and
103:18 - i don't narrate what i'm doing
103:21 - otherwise it's pretty much the same and
103:25 - i don't have all of you helping me so
103:27 - that that's another big difference
103:28 - that's a benefit to me
103:39 - Raphael says hello everyone hey Raphael
103:41 - glad you could join I love the name
103:46 - Raphael I named my first son Raphael
104:16 - all right so I'm down to the bottom here
104:20 - of the live chat and this is where I go
104:24 - to ask me to talk about myself a little
104:25 - bit okay so let me do that well let me
104:38 - answer there's an easy question here
104:39 - I'll answer first before I get to that
104:41 - one Navan says what's the tool you used
104:44 - to record sessions
104:46 - it's called OBS so I think it works for
104:50 - for Mac and Windows
104:53 - I'm ever checked if it works on Linux or
104:55 - not not sure but OBS it was fairly easy
105:00 - to set up I had to mess with the
105:02 - settings a little bit to get it right
105:05 - but now that I have the settings right
105:08 - it's pretty easy cool and Navin also
105:15 - asks hi once again it's one month like
105:20 - we started 100 days of code would
105:22 - request you to make one session it will
105:25 - be an honor for us please I'm not
105:30 - exactly sure what you're asking so
105:33 - request you to take one session what
105:36 - sessions are so anyway Navin if you
105:40 - could elaborate a little bit on your
105:43 - last comment there about the 100 days of
105:47 - code and everything that would be good
105:50 - because I'm not exactly sure what would
105:54 - you're asking all right so while I'm
105:57 - waiting on the oh okay so Navin says we
106:02 - do online sessions from free code camp
106:07 - from the free code camp algorithms ok
106:12 - cool
106:20 - so
106:24 - all right so let me let me know if I'm
106:27 - wrong on this so is are you saying you
106:29 - have basically like it would just be a
106:34 - session of doing a free code camp
106:37 - algorithm online
106:50 - hey Brett I'll see you sir Brett's gotta
106:52 - go thank you so much Brett you were like
106:55 - a really big help and I really
106:58 - appreciate it so hopefully I could see
107:00 - you back here again okay so I'm okay
107:05 - Navin that seems that seems pretty cool
107:08 - could you so my length to my Twitter is
107:15 - in the description could you direct
107:18 - message me there with more details and
107:20 - time to kind of like get a better idea
107:23 - of exactly what's going on and let me
107:29 - know or I mean if you if you get find me
107:32 - on another social media or email or
107:34 - something that works too but usually
107:36 - Twitter is the most reliable way for me
107:39 - to answer so just let me know let me
107:42 - know some more details we could talk
107:43 - about it but that sounds pretty cool I'm
107:46 - definitely interested all right so I
107:49 - goes let me get C to your question a bit
107:52 - about myself so I just wanted to know a
107:55 - little bit about me also said I will
107:58 - start computer science University in a
108:00 - week so good luck with that just don't
108:04 - know what to expect at the Uni all right
108:09 - so anyway so I'm not I'm not sure
108:13 - exactly what area of my life that you
108:19 - would want to know about but I guess
108:23 - I'll just give you really general
108:26 - general overview so I'm gonna set a
108:29 - timer for five minutes
108:31 - because otherwise I'll just go on and on
108:34 - you all probably know by now that I can
108:36 - I can talk when I get into something so
108:41 - yeah so if you want to know about my my
108:46 - coding journey I did a video on my own
108:52 - channel about like when I first learned
108:53 - to code and kind of the steps along the
108:55 - way to where I am so I'm not gonna go
108:57 - into that so much since you can already
108:59 - watch that that's on my my
109:02 - which i think is linked in the
109:04 - description but basically all right
109:11 - here's the basics my name is Jessie and
109:13 - I I was born and raised in West Virginia
109:17 - in the United States and I had I live in
109:22 - Ohio now I work at a university I'm a
109:25 - front-end developer I'm married I have
109:28 - four kids from the ages of eight down to
109:31 - nine months old not sure if that's the
109:35 - information you expected but anyway yeah
109:42 - I am I I do live streams now and which
109:49 - is crazy because I'm normally pretty
109:50 - private before I did this I really never
109:54 - posted very much on social media I was
109:58 - very nervous about anyone even seeing my
110:00 - code if I would go to a conference
110:04 - I like usually didn't talk to a lot of
110:08 - people you know so it was a little it
110:14 - was kind of odd and like a
110:15 - spur-of-the-moment decision almost like
110:17 - one day at one morning I think I had
110:20 - thought about it occasionally but I
110:22 - remember one morning waking up and
110:24 - getting ready for work and thinking like
110:26 - oh I'm gonna do this and then I just
110:28 - came in and and did it like that was it
110:32 - yeah so yeah so I was somewhat
110:35 - introverted and I mean I mean like I'd
110:40 - be fine if I didn't leave my house very
110:42 - often like so not that I don't like
110:45 - people I mean I love people and I
110:46 - usually am fine when I'm around people
110:49 - and get into it it's just the act of
110:50 - actually going out to go do that do
110:53 - something it's like jumping in a pool
110:56 - like I don't want to jump in a pool if
110:59 - it's cold but usually once you jump in
111:01 - and get used to the water it's fine
111:03 - that's kind of how I am with like social
111:06 - situations like rather a little bit hard
111:09 - for me to leave but once I'm there I'm
111:11 - okay
111:12 - so
111:15 - yes so that's I guess a little bit about
111:19 - what I'm kind of about how I am NOT on
111:25 - the stream I mentioned earlier that I
111:27 - really like cooking so I've worked at
111:29 - restaurants before never as a chef but
111:33 - just other pretty much everything else
111:35 - you can do at a restaurant besides being
111:38 - a chef and so I've kind of picked up so
111:44 - that's kind of my other passion you know
111:47 - my other hobby besides coding that I'm
111:50 - really into I don't really get to do it
111:53 - as often as I can because I'm usually
111:55 - working but when I do get to do it it's
111:59 - it's really fun I do some gaming not
112:05 - really a lot
112:06 - I enjoy Starcraft which is an old-school
112:08 - game from the 90s not Starcraft 2 I mean
112:13 - that the original Starcraft and then
112:15 - otherwise I'm pretty much confined to
112:17 - mobile games which I know people say
112:20 - that's not really gaming but when I'm
112:24 - busy and I have four kids it's like so
112:26 - much easier just to play on a phone in
112:29 - one hand while I'm holding a baby and
112:31 - the other hand helps pass the time when
112:36 - you're walking around at night trying to
112:37 - put a crying baby to sleep so anyway so
112:43 - I'm almost done with my five minutes of
112:45 - me so obviously there's a lot more to
112:48 - tell
112:48 - it's just China just kind of throwing
112:51 - out whatever I could think of for right
112:53 - now let's see I'm 31 I don't know if
112:58 - I've ever said I would I am so 31 years
113:01 - old let me think
113:06 - my favorite sport is American football
113:09 - although I rarely ever watch it and
113:12 - certainly don't play it anymore do you
113:17 - think
113:18 - I used to be a high school teacher I've
113:24 - been a high school teacher before I've
113:26 - been a manager at a fast food restaurant
113:30 - I've done a lot of things I used to be a
113:34 - day trader in the stock market so anyway
113:37 - but five minutes is up so I know that
113:41 - was kind of all over the place and
113:43 - didn't necessarily have anything to do
113:44 - with coding but if you want to know
113:46 - about more of coding related things
113:48 - about me then check out my my channel I
113:51 - have at least one video about that yes
113:57 - so I go said you are 31 and wow you have
114:01 - four kids and you worked a lot of places
114:02 - yeah I got married when I was 21 so got
114:07 - started early with being married and
114:11 - having kids and yeah so I jumped around
114:15 - in jobs quite a bit I was only a manager
114:18 - at a fast food place for a few months
114:21 - and that was just not really my thing
114:23 - although I got free food which was
114:25 - awesome that was the best part about the
114:28 - Chuck and I've worked at different
114:34 - places the day trading stock burger
114:39 - thing was really awesome for a while
114:40 - until I lost most of my money and then
114:44 - it wasn't so awesome but good thing my
114:49 - wife was very patient with me whenever
114:50 - that happened yeah I was a high school
114:56 - teacher for a little over three years
114:58 - so that was my longest the longest stay
115:00 - at any job unless you count my high
115:03 - school job with I worked for a city in
115:07 - West Virginia called weirdin so the city
115:10 - of Weirton had me I was a maintenance
115:13 - person basically and I cleaned up
115:15 - playgrounds I did that for like six
115:17 - summers in a row so anyway I've gone
115:22 - over my time so I'm gonna I'm gonna stop
115:24 - now if anyone if anyone wants me to do
115:30 - that again just let me know
115:31 - in the in the live chat so I try to keep
115:36 - it centered on code mostly since this is
115:39 - free code camp but I'm not opposed to a
115:43 - few minutes of talking about me only if
115:46 - you're really interested otherwise I'm
115:49 - not gonna definitely not going to do it
115:52 - so anyway I guess I thank you you're
115:55 - welcome no problem all right so I think
116:04 - I've answered all the questions and
116:13 - let's see yeah I think sorry I'm just
116:18 - just checking my calendar on my other
116:21 - screen to see make sure I can stream at
116:24 - the same time tomorrow
116:28 - actually yeah tomorrow might be a little
116:31 - bit different time for a stream mm-hmm
116:35 - it might be a morning in am stream
116:37 - eastern time so I'll try to get in early
116:39 - and let you all know as soon as I can
116:42 - because I have I have to do an interview
116:45 - for a candidate for a web developer
116:48 - position that we have open right around
116:50 - the same time I normally stream so I
116:52 - don't really want to risk it and if that
116:55 - goes longer than expected then I won't
116:57 - be able to stream so probably plan on
117:00 - doing a stream tomorrow morning eastern
117:02 - time maybe like 10:00 a.m. somewhere
117:06 - around there Eastern but so I'll see
117:12 - y'all then hopefully I can get some of
117:14 - this figured out that we worked on today
117:15 - and let you know how it went but anyway
117:21 - thank you so much for watching and for
117:23 - all your help
117:24 - I really appreciate that and I'll be
117:27 - back tomorrow
117:28 - have a great day
