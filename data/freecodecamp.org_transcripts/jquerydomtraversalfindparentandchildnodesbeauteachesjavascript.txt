00:00 - hello
00:01 - this video is all about traversing the
00:03 - dom using jquery it's all about trying
00:06 - to find specific html elements based on
00:09 - the relation to other elements you can
00:12 - find parent elements child elements i
00:15 - have this html set up in here to show a
00:18 - lot of different
00:19 - parent elements and child elements you
00:21 - can see how one element is related to
00:23 - another because these green boxes
00:26 - basically show what elements contain
00:28 - other elements i just have css that
00:31 - applies to everything to make this all
00:33 - work here so you can see this div is the
00:36 - parent of this unordered list here
00:39 - and you can see
00:40 - this unordered list is the child of the
00:44 - div here we have a bunch of children of
00:48 - this span also all these elements here
00:52 - in the middle are siblings of each other
00:55 - they're all on the same level you can
00:57 - see that same thing in the html that's
00:59 - how you can tell parents and children
01:01 - okay i'm gonna bring up the javascript
01:03 - here so we can just focus on the jquery
01:05 - we're gonna use i've already added
01:07 - jquery to the project you can check my
01:09 - first video in the series to learn how
01:11 - to do that okay i just pasted in some
01:14 - code here we have the jquery selector to
01:16 - select the the li element and here's
01:19 - here's the new thing we're learning dot
01:21 - parent now we're going to get the parent
01:24 - of the li element and then we're just
01:26 - going to change the css we're going to
01:29 - change the color chocolate and
01:31 - the border is also going to be changed
01:33 - to chocolate i decided to use a tasty
01:35 - color this time so let's run that
01:39 - and you can see the parent of the li
01:41 - element has turned to chocolate so
01:44 - here's the li element and here's the
01:46 - parent the ul element now if i change
01:49 - this to span here
01:51 - i run that
01:52 - the interesting thing about that is
01:54 - there are two spans we have the span
01:56 - here and we have the span here the
01:58 - parent of this man is the li the parent
02:00 - of this span is the other span another
02:03 - thing we can do is instead of using
02:04 - parent do parents plural with an s at
02:07 - the end that's going to get all the
02:09 - parents all the way up to the root
02:11 - element so if i run that
02:14 - you can see now there's a bunch of
02:15 - things even things that we didn't even
02:17 - know about including this other div here
02:20 - have turned to chocolate border
02:22 - now another one we can do to find
02:24 - parents let's find the parent of the li
02:26 - element so instead of parents here we're
02:28 - gonna do parents until
02:30 - so this is going to find all the
02:32 - elements between two so starting at the
02:35 - li element and going to let's do the div
02:39 - element so let's see what happens there
02:41 - okay so it started at the li element
02:44 - it ended at the div element every
02:46 - element in between is just this ul
02:48 - element okay the the children method
02:51 - goes in the opposite direction so
02:53 - instead of the parents until i'm gonna
02:54 - change this to children
02:56 - and we're not gonna put anything in the
02:58 - parentheses here and let's run that and
03:00 - see what happens
03:02 - and as you can see this only is going to
03:04 - traverse a single level down in the dom
03:06 - tree so we're just going to get the span
03:08 - element if there were multiple li
03:10 - elements we would get the children of
03:12 - each of those elements now i'm going to
03:14 - change this to span
03:16 - so now we're going to get the children
03:17 - of the span elements
03:20 - and you can see all of these are the
03:21 - children of the span elements there's a
03:23 - bunch of children this of the span
03:24 - elements so inside the parentheses here
03:27 - we can put specifically which child we
03:29 - want so i'm going to put
03:31 - h2
03:33 - and then run that
03:35 - and now it's only selecting the child of
03:38 - a span element that's an h2 element
03:41 - i'm also going to show you about find
03:43 - so i'm going to start this at ul and
03:46 - we're going to find all children
03:49 - after the ul element that are specific
03:52 - elements in this case i'm going to do
03:55 - span
03:56 - so we're going to start the ul element
03:58 - and then we're going to find all
04:00 - children that are span elements all the
04:02 - way down so let's run that
04:05 - so we found this span and this span and
04:08 - if you want to find all children
04:10 - not just the span elements you can put
04:14 - an asterisk here
04:16 - so it starts with the ul element then it
04:18 - finds all children that are any type of
04:21 - element and make some chocolate
04:23 - okay now we're going to talk about
04:24 - siblings i was telling you earlier that
04:27 - all these ones in the middle are
04:28 - siblings of each other i'm going to put
04:31 - h2 here and i'm going to use the method
04:34 - siblings
04:35 - nothing will be in the parentheses this
04:37 - time
04:38 - and we get all the siblings of the h2
04:40 - element not the h2 element but all the
04:43 - siblings are now chocolate and you may
04:45 - want to just get specific siblings so
04:49 - i'm going to put p
04:51 - for the paragraph tag now we're just
04:53 - getting the siblings of an h2 element
04:55 - that are paragraphs
04:57 - i'm going to delete this here we're
04:59 - going to keep selecting the h2 element
05:01 - but now i'm going to show you the next
05:03 - method
05:04 - so the next just gets the next sibling
05:08 - so we were started on the h2 element and
05:10 - the next sibling is the h3 element
05:13 - and there's also
05:15 - next all
05:18 - so we started the h2 element and then we
05:20 - get all the rest of the elements
05:22 - afterwards that are siblings
05:24 - and then we have next until
05:27 - this time i'm going to start the span
05:29 - element
05:31 - and if i go back into the html you'll
05:34 - see that this first span element has the
05:37 - class child
05:39 - so i'm gonna do span dot child to select
05:43 - just this span element just the child
05:45 - span element and not the parent span
05:48 - element and we're using the next until
05:51 - method next until
05:53 - h3
05:56 - so we start this this span here and we
05:58 - select all the elements between the span
06:00 - and h3 which is just h2
06:03 - if we put a paragraph tag in here
06:07 - then we'll also select the h3 afterwards
06:10 - so i showed you next next all and next
06:12 - until the same things work with prev
06:15 - preval and prev until that just gets the
06:18 - previous element or all the previous
06:21 - elements or a previous until an element
06:24 - so i'll just give you one example of
06:26 - that
06:27 - just the prev if we run that we start
06:29 - this span and the previous element is
06:31 - the paragraph again you can also do prep
06:34 - all preventive okay those are all the
06:36 - main methods for traversing the dom
06:38 - finding parent and child elements check
06:40 - the description for a list of all the
06:43 - the methods we went through thanks for
06:44 - watching my name is beau carnes don't
06:47 - forget to subscribe
06:48 - and remember use your code for good
