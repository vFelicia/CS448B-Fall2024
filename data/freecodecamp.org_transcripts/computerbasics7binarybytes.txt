00:00 - hi I'm Brianna with free code camp and
00:02 - today we're going to be talking about
00:03 - the very most basic level the computers
00:06 - can understand other languages like
00:08 - JavaScript the most basic thing like
00:11 - we've already talked about is a bit up
00:13 - or down 1 or 0 on top of that we've got
00:16 - the biked 8 bit put together all letters
00:20 - numbers and symbols can be broken down
00:22 - into bytes that the computer can
00:24 - understand the most basic level so that
00:27 - means all of the letters and symbols
00:29 - that you're using in your JavaScript can
00:31 - be translated into byte now there are a
00:34 - lot of languages that the computer uses
00:36 - at the most basic levels to run just the
00:39 - operating system but what I want you to
00:41 - get away from this lesson is that
00:43 - everything in your computer boils down
00:44 - to binary bytes
