00:09 - hi my name is luke siciliano i'm a web
00:11 - developer and i'm also self-employed
00:13 - i've decided to do this video for free
00:15 - code camp on the topic of how you can
00:17 - make money as a freelance developer or
00:19 - as someone who has just started up their
00:20 - own independent development business
00:22 - i feel that this is an important topic
00:24 - to talk about because a lot of people
00:27 - learn to code and then strike out on
00:29 - their own and quickly realize that
00:31 - running a business is a whole lot
00:33 - different than learning the code or
00:35 - working at dev job somewhere so the goal
00:38 - of this video is really to provide some
00:41 - tips and some framework for those who
00:43 - have decided to strike out on their own
00:44 - to hopefully make the whole venture a a
00:47 - little bit more enjoyable and be and
00:49 - most importantly a little bit more if
00:50 - not a lot more profitable
00:52 - so in this video we're really going to
00:54 - talk about a few different things
00:57 - number one is we're going to lay out
00:59 - some basic rules for making money as an
01:01 - independent developer and you may think
01:04 - well making money is easy i do work for
01:06 - people and i make money well some
01:09 - developers make a lot more money than
01:10 - others and the things we're going to
01:12 - focus on in that segment will touch on
01:14 - why and how you can actually increase
01:16 - your profits and make more money as a
01:18 - developer the second thing we're going
01:20 - to talk about is planning your new
01:22 - business and what i mean by this is
01:25 - the fact that you don't want to just run
01:26 - out and you know hang up your sign and
01:28 - say woohoo i'm in business now you
01:30 - really need to have a plan in place that
01:32 - deals with things such as what type of
01:34 - customers are you going to serve what
01:36 - types of services are you going to offer
01:39 - and you know what kind of company are
01:40 - you going to form and so on so forth if
01:43 - you have all those things nailed it from
01:45 - the get-go then you wind up making a lot
01:47 - more money and having a lot less stress
01:48 - on the back end so that's the second
01:50 - thing we'll be talking about
01:52 - the third thing we'll be talking about
01:54 - is actually getting started and at that
01:56 - point you've made your plan you've
01:58 - decided who you're going to serve what
01:59 - services you're going to offer and all
02:01 - that good stuff but now you've actually
02:02 - got to form the business you've got to
02:04 - get your infrastructure in place and all
02:06 - those things and that's what we'll be
02:07 - dealing with in that part of the video
02:10 - and in the fourth segment of this video
02:12 - we'll talk about managing your business
02:14 - on a day-to-day basis from both an
02:16 - administrative standpoint as well as a
02:19 - development standpoint and you're gonna
02:21 - find that doing both are equally
02:23 - important and if you manage yourself on
02:25 - a day-to-day basis correctly you can
02:28 - really make a lot more money
02:30 - so before we dive into it let's talk
02:32 - about who this video is for
02:34 - if you're someone who has already
02:36 - decided i'm going to
02:38 - go the freelance route i'm going to
02:40 - start an independent development shop or
02:42 - you've already done that you know in
02:44 - other words you're already on your own
02:45 - somewhere then this video is for you if
02:48 - you are debating
02:50 - whether or not you want to be a
02:51 - freelance developer whether or not you
02:53 - want to start your own dev shop or just
02:55 - kind of debating whether you want to get
02:56 - a job for somebody
02:58 - and that's a topic i've already
02:59 - discussed in a prior video and we're
03:01 - going to link to that in the description
03:03 - below with a time stamp so i would
03:05 - suggest watching that portion of that
03:07 - video before deciding whether or not
03:10 - you know this video is appropriate for
03:12 - you so
03:14 - with all that said let's get to it and
03:16 - good luck
03:27 - okay so the first thing we're going to
03:28 - talk about is the three basic rules to
03:30 - making money as a freelance developer
03:33 - and you've gotta nail all three of these
03:34 - things otherwise you're really gonna
03:36 - find yourself feeling like you're always
03:37 - stuck in second gear if not first gear
03:40 - and you're gonna feel like you just
03:41 - can't get ahead in your business and you
03:42 - may very well quit right because what
03:45 - happens when you feel like you're not
03:46 - getting ahead you certainly don't want
03:47 - to continue with something so
03:49 - understanding the three rules to making
03:50 - money as a freelancer is key before we
03:52 - get into
03:53 - anything else so what are the three
03:55 - rules number one is understanding that
03:58 - the amount of money you're going to make
04:00 - is in direct proportion to the amount of
04:02 - value you provide to other people so in
04:04 - other words you other person provide
04:06 - value okay that's rule number one
04:09 - rule number two
04:11 - is understanding the need to focus on
04:14 - your highest paying activities which may
04:16 - sound like duh but you would be
04:18 - surprised at how many people struggle in
04:20 - that area and rule number three is the
04:23 - need to understand that you have a
04:25 - full-time job and put in the time as
04:27 - soon as you strike out on your own again
04:29 - may sound common sense but you would be
04:31 - surprised so let's go ahead and take a
04:33 - look at each of these three rules all
04:35 - right
04:36 - and again you have to do all three
04:39 - number one
04:40 - the amount of money you're going to make
04:42 - is in direct proportion to the amount of
04:44 - value you provide to other people
04:47 - what do i mean by this
04:48 - and first thing you got to do is put
04:50 - yourself in the shoes of a customer all
04:52 - right the customer doesn't care about
04:54 - your experience the customer doesn't
04:56 - care about you know what languages you
04:59 - know they don't care about how much time
05:00 - you're going to put into something
05:02 - all that matters to them is the amount
05:05 - of value their business receives from
05:07 - the product you provide to them right
05:10 - let's say for example you're building an
05:12 - app for
05:13 - let's say a little restaurant
05:15 - and uh you know the restaurant owner
05:17 - says hey i want an app where people can
05:19 - order food online i want an app where
05:22 - people can make reservations online uh
05:24 - see my menu things of this nature
05:26 - somebody comes along and offers to build
05:30 - this app in a content management system
05:32 - like
05:33 - wordpress or joomla or something like
05:36 - that and they tell the restaurant
05:37 - whether they'll do it for three thousand
05:39 - bucks
05:40 - you come along and you tell the
05:42 - restaurant owner that you'll build them
05:44 - something from scratch you'll write your
05:45 - own html you'll write your own css
05:47 - you'll write your own javascript
05:49 - and you're gonna charge them five
05:51 - thousand dollars
05:52 - well
05:53 - here if your five thousand dollar app is
05:55 - right here and someone else's three
05:57 - thousand dollar cms bait pace app is
06:00 - right here
06:01 - and you provide
06:02 - no more functionality and no more value
06:05 - to the client in other words you don't
06:06 - make the client's business any better
06:08 - with your app than this person does with
06:10 - their app
06:11 - then
06:12 - all that all you've done is propose
06:14 - something that's more expensive right
06:17 - if you're not providing additional value
06:19 - to your customer they're not gonna pay
06:21 - more money
06:22 - okay why would i pay five thousand for
06:24 - something i can get the exact same
06:25 - functionality for three thousand
06:28 - um
06:29 - so what you've got to understand is the
06:31 - more you improve the customers situation
06:34 - the more money that customer is going to
06:37 - be willing to pay you okay so in other
06:40 - words it's not about what you think is
06:41 - important it's about what the customer
06:43 - sees as value so instead of saying
06:47 - mine's better because i'm not using a
06:49 - cms and i'm writing it i'm writing all
06:51 - the code myself again that doesn't make
06:53 - the customer's situation any better
06:54 - right
06:55 - but i hear from developers all the time
06:57 - and i've had many conversations with
06:59 - freelance developers who really do think
07:01 - that simply by
07:03 - coding things from scratch instead of
07:05 - using you know different tools that
07:07 - they're somehow providing a better
07:09 - product like well these are people who
07:11 - don't understand it's about providing
07:12 - value to the customer so if you're going
07:14 - to write something from scratch for the
07:16 - customer what you need to do is explain
07:19 - how your app provides value that the
07:21 - other one doesn't so for example hey
07:24 - that person's building you an app in a
07:26 - content management system here are some
07:28 - of the limitations in the content
07:30 - management system it may limit you in
07:33 - terms of how you want to grow your
07:34 - business
07:35 - with the app i'm going to write for you
07:37 - however you won't have those limitations
07:40 - and then you explain to them about how
07:42 - your app provides additional value that
07:43 - the other one does in other words value
07:45 - meaning your app allows their business
07:47 - to grow more than the other app does
07:49 - okay so
07:50 - taking the approach of understanding
07:53 - that you've got to explain value to your
07:54 - customers
07:56 - is how you're going to make more money
07:58 - always put yourself in your customers
08:00 - perspective and ask yourself what is it
08:01 - the customer is looking for what does
08:03 - the customer see as valuable the more
08:06 - you provide that value to the customer
08:08 - the more the customer is going to be
08:09 - willing to pay you okay that's rule
08:11 - number one provide value to the customer
08:14 - rule number two
08:15 - is the fact that you need to focus on
08:17 - your highest paying activities
08:20 - way too often i mean way too often
08:23 - people get themselves in this trap of
08:25 - focusing on work that has the highest
08:28 - total price tag
08:30 - but doesn't necessarily pay the most per
08:32 - unit of input
08:34 - let's use a simple example let's say
08:36 - i'm going to write a dinky little app
08:37 - for somebody pretty simple um it's only
08:40 - gonna take me maybe five hours uh i'm
08:42 - gonna charge them twenty five hundred
08:44 - bucks for it let's say
08:46 - that's five hundred dollars an hour
08:47 - right
08:48 - now let's say but it's also only twenty
08:50 - five hundred dollars
08:52 - now let's say the opportunity to write
08:54 - another app comes along
08:56 - and on that app i'm going to charge
08:59 - 50 000
09:01 - but i have to put in a lot and i mean a
09:04 - lot more time for obvious reasons on
09:07 - that big app
09:09 - well the first app you know let's say i
09:11 - made
09:12 - 2505 hours
09:14 - okay it's 500 an hour
09:16 - second app let's say when i sat sit down
09:18 - and look at it later i realized i only
09:20 - made 350 an hour on it
09:22 - a lot of people will get in the trap of
09:24 - saying
09:25 - well you know i made more money over
09:27 - here because i made 25 000 as opposed to
09:29 - 2500
09:31 - but what they're not recognizing is
09:34 - that you only have so much time in the
09:35 - day you only have so many resources to
09:37 - go around and you need to put those
09:39 - resources into the higher value
09:41 - activities so
09:43 - one was just enough the higher dollar
09:45 - amount in that scenario was just a
09:46 - chance to work more basically so what
09:49 - you want to do is look at the kinds of
09:51 - services you're providing
09:53 - and let's say you're providing three
09:54 - different services four different
09:56 - services to customers
09:57 - whatever service you're providing pick
09:59 - the one that pays the most
10:01 - per hour of input per resource that you
10:04 - put into it and do more of that so
10:08 - using my scenario from a minute ago
10:10 - the 2500 app that you can get done in
10:12 - five hours go out and find as many
10:14 - customers as you can to churn those apps
10:16 - out forget that larger work just try to
10:18 - turn those other things out in mass
10:20 - because again you make more per unit of
10:22 - input
10:23 - on those
10:24 - think of it in these terms
10:26 - if you have a choice of going to a job
10:28 - that pays you ten dollars an hour and
10:29 - you can work all the hours you want you
10:31 - have a choice of going to another job
10:33 - that pays you 15 an hour and you can
10:35 - work all the hours you want
10:36 - i would hope you would go to the 15 an
10:38 - hour job all the time and never show up
10:40 - at the 10 hour job again right
10:42 - i mean that's only common sense so
10:45 - you've got to take this same approach
10:46 - into your freelance business whatever's
10:48 - paying you the most focus on that and do
10:51 - as much of that as you humanly can we're
10:53 - going to talk a little bit more about
10:55 - this in a little bit later section in
10:57 - this course but for right now understand
10:59 - that the second rule of making money is
11:02 - focusing on the
11:04 - activities that pay you the most per
11:06 - unit of input your highest value
11:08 - activities okay so rule number one
11:11 - provide value to the customer
11:13 - rule number two
11:14 - is focused on the activities that are of
11:16 - the highest value to your freelancing
11:18 - business
11:20 - rule number three
11:21 - is you've got to put in the time again
11:23 - that may sound simple but you would be
11:26 - really surprised
11:28 - once you decide to go out on your own
11:31 - you have a full-time job you need to
11:32 - work full-time at your business this may
11:34 - sound like a sound like a shock but you
11:36 - don't get paid for not going to work
11:38 - okay
11:40 - so
11:41 - let's say
11:43 - you've got two customers
11:44 - um you're just starting out
11:47 - and
11:48 - right now those two customers keep you
11:50 - busy for say 15 hours a week
11:53 - a lot of developers are going to do that
11:55 - 15 hours of coding work and you know
11:57 - customer service every week and then
11:59 - after that just kind of sit around
12:00 - twiddle their thumbs
12:02 - you know wait for more work to come in
12:04 - the door
12:05 - but again what they don't understand is
12:07 - like i said once you strike out on your
12:09 - own you have a full-time job so let's
12:12 - just say you call a full-time job 40
12:14 - hours a week
12:15 - well if your customers are only taking
12:17 - up 15 hours a week that means you have
12:19 - 25 more hours that you need to be out
12:20 - trying to hustle up more business so
12:23 - 15 hours working for customers 25 hours
12:25 - trying to hustle up more business equals
12:27 - your 40 hours and think how many more
12:29 - customers you'll have
12:30 - if you put in that time in other words
12:34 - there is something you can be doing on
12:36 - you know to fill up your hours and make
12:38 - it a full-time job treat your business
12:41 - like a full-time job you're not going to
12:42 - make any money unless you work at it and
12:45 - as silly as that may sound again you
12:48 - would be surprised i i've talked to
12:49 - small business owner after small
12:51 - business owner after small business
12:52 - owner who doesn't work 40 hours a week a
12:55 - lot of times they don't work 30 hours a
12:56 - week
12:57 - and they're wondering why they're not
12:58 - making any money well you don't make
13:00 - money for not working okay so rule
13:03 - number one
13:04 - focus on providing value to your
13:06 - customer understand that your customer
13:09 - only cares about the value they receive
13:11 - and focus on providing as much value to
13:13 - them as humanly possible
13:15 - rule number two is identify the
13:17 - activities in your business which pay
13:19 - you the most per unit of input your
13:21 - highest value activities to yourself and
13:23 - focus on those
13:24 - rule number three is put in the time
13:27 - if you follow those three things
13:29 - you really are going to be ahead of a
13:32 - very large percentage of other freelance
13:34 - developers out there and i mean a very
13:36 - large percentage of them you are ahead
13:38 - of the game
13:39 - from the get-go just by understanding
13:42 - those three things okay and because
13:44 - you're going to understand those three
13:45 - things that's why you're going to do
13:46 - well
13:47 - working for yourself
13:49 - so now that we've talked about the three
13:51 - basic rules of making money let's talk
13:53 - about the planning stage of your new
13:54 - business
14:06 - okay let's go ahead and talk about the
14:07 - planning stage of your new company and
14:10 - what i mean by the planning stage is the
14:13 - fact that these are uh tasks and plans
14:16 - you should have in place before you even
14:18 - start taking customers if you do already
14:20 - have customers which is common freelance
14:23 - businesses then before you go out and
14:25 - try to bring in a whole lot
14:27 - more business you should really be
14:28 - knocking out the things we're about to
14:30 - talk about
14:31 - the reason why i say it's common for
14:33 - people to already have customers before
14:34 - they've planned out their business is a
14:36 - lot of times people start freelancing as
14:38 - a result of getting a random phone call
14:40 - and someone asking to complete a project
14:43 - and then bam next thing you know you're
14:45 - a freelancer
14:46 - so wherever you're at in your business
14:48 - whether you've already got your first
14:49 - customer or two or whether you're
14:51 - decided to strike out on your own and
14:54 - have not done so yet the following tasks
14:57 - that we're about to talk about are
14:58 - things that you need to get planned and
15:00 - in order before you start trying to take
15:03 - customers at any kind of scale okay um
15:06 - so we're really going to talk about four
15:08 - total things
15:09 - excuse me
15:10 - when it comes to planning your business
15:13 - number one is funding your operations um
15:16 - you may be thinking well what funding
15:19 - we'll talk about that in a minute number
15:21 - two is deciding what niche you're going
15:24 - to serve in other words you're not just
15:26 - going to provide random services to as
15:28 - many people as possible you want to
15:29 - actually pick a niche that you're going
15:31 - to serve and stay within that lane
15:33 - number three is figuring out what
15:35 - services you're going to offer within
15:38 - that niche and number four
15:41 - is going ahead and getting your company
15:43 - formed once you've got all those things
15:45 - figured out so
15:47 - let's go ahead and look at each of these
15:49 - things in turn
15:59 - okay so the first thing we need to talk
16:01 - about is how you're going to find your
16:02 - new business
16:03 - and
16:04 - right now when you hear that you might
16:06 - be thinking
16:07 - what funding is involved as a freelancer
16:09 - all i need to write code is my laptop
16:11 - and i already have that
16:13 - you will quickly be surprised at how
16:14 - fast expenses do start to add up for
16:17 - even someone who's self-employed you're
16:19 - going to have different service costs
16:23 - those service costs can include paying
16:24 - an accountant at the end of the year
16:26 - they can include paying for liability
16:29 - insurance for your business
16:30 - they can include the cost of a payroll
16:33 - company because you're going to want to
16:34 - form what's called nest corp which we'll
16:36 - talk about a little later um also if
16:39 - you're going to uh
16:41 - rent server space you're going to that's
16:44 - the service you're going to pay for in
16:45 - other words expenses will add up a lot
16:48 - faster
16:49 - than you may think
16:51 - and the one thing i cannot stress enough
16:54 - is that you want to be profitable from
16:57 - day one in your business and
17:00 - profitable every essentially every month
17:03 - after day one
17:04 - and month one
17:06 - it's really common in the technology
17:09 - industry for people to think it's okay
17:11 - to lose money for the sake of growth
17:14 - that is not okay it is not okay i know
17:16 - there are some big companies that have
17:18 - operated that way but trust me that is
17:20 - the exception it is not the rule
17:22 - contrary to what you see in the media
17:25 - what i would strongly suggest is for
17:27 - that you read a book called profit first
17:29 - we're going to link to it in the
17:31 - description below it talks a lot about
17:33 - why it is not okay
17:35 - for you to ever be losing money so in
17:38 - other words you want to be profitable
17:39 - from day one
17:40 - and you want to
17:44 - never be unprofitable okay
17:46 - so
17:47 - since you need to be profitable from day
17:49 - one the first manner of business is
17:52 - figuring out how to fund your operations
17:55 - do not go into debt to start your
17:57 - business okay
17:58 - mark cuban is on record as saying that
18:01 - only idiots would uh take out a loan or
18:04 - worse yet use a credit card to start a
18:06 - business
18:07 - if you take out a loan trust me the bank
18:10 - doesn't care if you are making money or
18:12 - not you've got to make those payments if
18:14 - you borrow money from relatives
18:16 - if you want you know not paying your
18:18 - relatives back might be a good way to
18:20 - destroy your relationship with them and
18:22 - if you start using credit cards next
18:24 - thing you know you're paying extremely
18:25 - high interest rates so do not go into
18:28 - debt
18:29 - it's essentially digging yourself into a
18:31 - hole that can be
18:32 - very difficult to get out of
18:35 - if you're someone that's just starting
18:36 - out and you've already got your first
18:38 - customer
18:40 - then whatever they're paying you
18:42 - essentially needs to sit in your
18:44 - business bank account and not go into
18:45 - your pocket it needs to sit in your
18:47 - business bank account and serve as a
18:50 - source of funding for when you get your
18:52 - next client if
18:54 - you don't have your first client yet and
18:56 - you're striking out on your own then as
18:59 - we talked about in our last section you
19:00 - need to be working 40 hours a week at
19:02 - your new business but you also need to
19:04 - be making some other money on decide to
19:06 - support yourself so whether that's for
19:08 - some kind of side hustle whether it's
19:09 - driving for uber or whatever
19:12 - you need to be
19:14 - self-funding in this in other words your
19:16 - business needs to fund itself and if
19:18 - you're just starting out
19:20 - then you need to fund your new business
19:22 - from whatever your other form of
19:24 - employment or
19:25 - income is in other words
19:27 - be uh self-funding and profitable from
19:30 - day one do not take out debt do not take
19:33 - out loans this is something
19:35 - i cannot stress enough
19:37 - so
19:38 - best ways to
19:40 - fund your new business
19:42 - there are quite a few like i said if you
19:44 - have a full-time job and you've decided
19:47 - to go the freelance route
19:50 - then guess what you now have two
19:52 - full-time jobs stay at your current job
19:55 - while working full-time at your
19:57 - freelance gig until you're in a spot
19:59 - where you can quit the full-time job
20:01 - which if you're hustling up at the
20:03 - freelance gig and working full time at
20:05 - it you will be able to quit your
20:06 - full-time job pretty quickly okay
20:09 - so
20:10 - your current source of your current
20:11 - employment
20:13 - can be a form of funding uh if you've
20:16 - got your first client again what they
20:18 - pay you should just sit in the operating
20:19 - account there's funding for your
20:20 - business don't take it out and spend it
20:23 - leave it in there to fund the business
20:26 - if you don't have a job currently and
20:29 - you
20:30 - are striking out on your own as a
20:31 - freelancer and you don't have any
20:33 - clients then again what you need to be
20:35 - doing is driving for uber or finding
20:37 - other ways to make money and live off of
20:39 - that
20:40 - and live off of that and leave some in
20:42 - the um you know in your reserve so you
20:44 - can also fund your business going
20:46 - forward but fund your business with cash
20:48 - that you have in cash that you earn do
20:50 - not fund it with debt that is something
20:52 - i cannot stress enough
20:54 - one of the best ways
20:56 - to make sure your freelance business
20:58 - fails is to start taking on debt okay
21:01 - and just think of it like this it's
21:02 - pretty hard to go broke if you don't
21:04 - know anybody any money right
21:06 - when you think of people who go broke
21:08 - it's usually because of that
21:10 - avoid debt in your new business i can't
21:12 - stress this enough this is something i'm
21:14 - not going to go on and on about instead
21:16 - again read profit first it's linked to
21:18 - in the description below
21:20 - okay so since we've talked about the
21:23 - biggest rule of funding your business
21:25 - avoid debt and fund it from
21:27 - other sources let's go ahead and talk
21:28 - about picking a niche for your new
21:30 - business
21:41 - okay so let's talk about choosing a
21:42 - niche for your new freelance business
21:45 - and what do i mean by niche by niche i
21:47 - mean you need to select a
21:50 - relatively narrow group of customers
21:52 - you're going to serve
21:53 - and or a relatively narrow group of
21:56 - services you're going to provide you do
21:58 - not want to take the approach of saying
22:01 - i need work i will take whatever is
22:02 - available and whatever comes in my door
22:05 - picking a niche is this strategy for
22:07 - making more money taking whatever comes
22:09 - in the door is a strategy for making
22:11 - less money
22:12 - so let's look at two things number one
22:14 - let's figure out why it is you need a
22:16 - niche in the first place and number two
22:18 - let's go about how you pick that niche
22:19 - okay
22:20 - so number one why do you need a niche in
22:23 - the first place well as i just said a
22:25 - second ago it leads to you having a less
22:27 - scalable business let's use a really
22:29 - simple example suppose
22:31 - i own a restaurant and i come to you and
22:33 - i say hey i want you to build me an app
22:35 - that for my restaurant that does a b and
22:37 - c
22:38 - okay to get that app working you may
22:40 - have to incorporate some third-party
22:42 - applications into it which means you
22:44 - have to go out and research those
22:45 - third-party applications you have to
22:48 - figure out what you need to do to
22:49 - incorporate them in the app when you
22:50 - build it and so on so forth
22:53 - you also might not know anything about
22:54 - the restaurant industry and as a result
22:56 - of that you need to take the time to
22:58 - learn a lot about the industry in
22:59 - general so you can learn about my
23:01 - business and build me a quality app
23:03 - and you charge me
23:06 - five thousand dollars for my app
23:08 - now later when the second restaurant
23:10 - comes along and wants a similar app
23:13 - you're already familiar with those
23:14 - third-party applications you already
23:16 - know a little bit about the restaurant
23:17 - industry that is all learning that you
23:19 - do not have to do a second time in order
23:22 - to charge the same amount of money the
23:24 - second time when you're building that
23:25 - second application so in other words by
23:28 - staying within the niche under this
23:30 - example restaurants you make more money
23:33 - unless you make uh more money by
23:36 - providing the same service in less time
23:38 - right to the second customer that's what
23:40 - happens when you choose a niche you're
23:42 - not in a state where you're constantly
23:45 - learning new languages learning new
23:46 - applications learning new industries and
23:49 - so on so forth the value of experience
23:51 - allows you to scale up your business and
23:52 - make more money by charging the same
23:54 - rate for your services but getting
23:56 - things done in less time okay
23:58 - what happens when you don't pick a niche
24:00 - well then you're constantly learning new
24:02 - languages you're constantly dealing with
24:03 - different kinds of businesses
24:05 - you're less likely to be able to reuse
24:07 - old code bases that you've written and
24:09 - so on so forth so picking a niche allows
24:12 - you to build a scalable business i
24:14 - cannot stress that enough
24:16 - now
24:17 - it is really really easy
24:19 - when you're first starting out to say
24:21 - i'm gonna take whatever comes in the
24:23 - door
24:24 - right
24:24 - um because after all you're just
24:26 - starting out you need clients but let's
24:28 - look at what that leads to
24:30 - you take whatever comes in the door as i
24:32 - said a minute ago you have to maybe
24:33 - learn a new language you have to learn
24:35 - some new frameworks you have to learn
24:37 - new applications you have to learn about
24:40 - a new industry
24:41 - and as a result you make some money but
24:43 - you don't make
24:44 - as much as you could the second time
24:46 - around right
24:47 - and now when your second client comes in
24:49 - the door the problem is because you're
24:50 - just taking anything and not sticking in
24:52 - a niche
24:53 - your second client is in an industry or
24:55 - field that has nothing to do with the
24:56 - first one so again you gotta learn some
24:57 - new applications and learn some new
24:59 - frameworks so on so forth you're
25:01 - constantly in a state of
25:04 - working
25:05 - more hours for less money and as a
25:07 - result of that you never get ahead and
25:09 - because you never get ahead you find
25:11 - yourself saying i need work so i'm going
25:12 - to take whatever comes in the door and
25:14 - it just becomes a vicious cycle that you
25:15 - literally never get out of so
25:17 - while it may be tempting to say i'm
25:20 - going to come whatever or i'm going to
25:21 - take whatever comes in the door i should
25:23 - say
25:24 - because i need money right now you have
25:26 - to recognize that that is a trap and it
25:28 - becomes very difficult to get out of
25:30 - taking work simply because it's
25:32 - available when it's outside of a niche
25:34 - you want to serve is like stepping over
25:36 - a dollar to pick up a dime it is not a
25:38 - good idea to step over a dollar and pick
25:40 - up a dime so when you get those work
25:42 - opportunities early on
25:44 - that are outside of the niche you're
25:45 - trying to serve
25:47 - it's hard but it's important to say no
25:48 - and trust me i completely understand it
25:50 - is hard to say no to revenue it is hard
25:52 - to say no to a potential customer but if
25:54 - it's outside that niche you want to
25:55 - serve whether that niche is working with
25:58 - a particular class a customer or
26:00 - providing a particular type of service
26:02 - or a combination of both it's important
26:04 - to say no when something falls outside
26:06 - your niche i just cannot stress that
26:07 - enough picking a niche means a more
26:10 - scalable business
26:11 - so how do you go about picking that
26:13 - niche right um that's a that's an
26:15 - important question
26:17 - uh that's really a broad topic and which
26:20 - could probably be
26:22 - i would say the subject of a second
26:24 - extremely long video
26:26 - the general rules i'll give you for
26:28 - picking a niche are
26:30 - pick something that you either are
26:31 - either one of two things one interested
26:33 - in it or
26:35 - two uh passionate slash you get excited
26:38 - about it um
26:39 - you know or you're good at it i guess
26:41 - would be a third thing so why do i say
26:43 - to pick something that you are
26:45 - excited about passionate about something
26:48 - your excuse me something you're really
26:50 - good at or something you have a
26:51 - particular skill set at
26:53 - number one is the fact that those are
26:55 - going to be things that you're likely to
26:57 - stick out the grind through right
27:00 - think of it like this if you're trying
27:02 - to do something that you're not good at
27:03 - and you're not excited about start and
27:06 - you're in those hard days of starting a
27:08 - business where the chances you're going
27:10 - to stick with this thing that you're not
27:11 - any good at and not excited about when
27:13 - you're already facing the struggles of
27:15 - starting a business the chances of you
27:16 - sticking with that aren't very good
27:17 - right
27:18 - so by picking something that you're
27:19 - either good at or excited about the
27:22 - chances are you're going to stick it out
27:23 - you know through the grind a lot more
27:26 - number two is the fact that if you're
27:28 - picking something that you're already
27:29 - good at and passionate about you're
27:31 - gonna find that that gives you the
27:33 - ability to provide more value than your
27:34 - competitors in that area so you're going
27:37 - to have a competitive advantage in large
27:39 - part because you are willing to put in
27:40 - that time so willingness to stick it out
27:43 - competitive advantage are the two big
27:44 - reasons why when choosing a niche you
27:47 - need to pick something that you're good
27:48 - at something that you're passionate
27:49 - about
27:50 - something that just kind of gets you
27:51 - excited um so on so forth the things i
27:54 - mentioned
27:56 - one interesting question i would say i
27:58 - get a lot is
27:59 - well
28:00 - how do i pick a niche and then i say
28:03 - what i just said i say well what are you
28:05 - excited about what do you like to do
28:06 - what are you good at
28:08 - and people didn't look at me a little
28:10 - bit confused and just to be frank
28:13 - the question of what do you like to do
28:14 - shouldn't be a hard question i mean what
28:16 - is it you like to do right
28:18 - um
28:20 - you know find things you are interested
28:22 - in personally
28:23 - and then try to make those your business
28:25 - and then that's something you're going
28:26 - to be more likely to stick with
28:28 - over time don't over complicate the idea
28:30 - of finding something that interests you
28:33 - and then just kind of rolling with it i
28:34 - cannot stress that enough so number one
28:38 - pick a niche number two
28:40 - is when you're picking that niche find
28:42 - something you're interested in something
28:44 - you're excited about
28:45 - um you know so on something you enjoy so
28:48 - on and so forth okay so now that that's
28:51 - out of the way let's get on to the next
28:52 - part of our video
29:03 - okay now that you've decided what niche
29:05 - you're going to serve it's important to
29:06 - figure out what services you're going to
29:08 - offer to that niche and then how you're
29:09 - going to charge for those services so
29:12 - let's look at each of those and we're
29:14 - really going to break this part of the
29:15 - discussion down into three sections the
29:17 - first section is going to be what
29:19 - services to offer the second section is
29:21 - going to be how to charge for those
29:23 - services and then the third part is
29:26 - going to be the need to make sure you're
29:27 - adding recurring revenue okay
29:29 - so let's look at each of these in turn
29:31 - number one what services should you be
29:34 - offering your potential customers that
29:36 - are within the niche you've picked out
29:37 - for yourself
29:39 - well what services to offer really comes
29:42 - down to three things and the first of
29:44 - these three things is how much are you
29:47 - interested in the work
29:48 - the second of these three things is to
29:51 - what extent is it scalable the third of
29:53 - these three things is to what extent can
29:56 - you outsource some of the work those
29:58 - three things decide what services you
30:00 - should be offering your niche let's look
30:02 - at each of those
30:04 - the reason why your level of interest is
30:06 - important when you're deciding what
30:07 - services you're going to offer is simple
30:09 - if you're performing work that you find
30:11 - boring that you find dull that you don't
30:13 - care about whatsoever the chances of you
30:15 - wanting to stick with it long term and
30:17 - build a business are slim to none to
30:20 - if there was a way to say negative it
30:22 - would probably be negative
30:24 - think of it like this if you have a nine
30:25 - to five job you certainly don't want to
30:27 - go to something that's completely boring
30:28 - every day right well
30:30 - trying to do that in the grind of your
30:32 - own business is even harder so when
30:34 - deciding what services to offer it needs
30:36 - to be something that interests you
30:37 - number one
30:39 - even if something interests you though
30:41 - to have a viable business it needs to be
30:42 - something you can scale out in other
30:44 - words something you can do at scale and
30:47 - the scalability of your idea really has
30:50 - two components to it
30:52 - number one is the fact of is or is the
30:55 - question of is there enough of a
30:56 - customer base out there you may
30:59 - perform a task for somebody and really
31:01 - enjoy the work and then find out it's
31:02 - just something that doesn't come up that
31:04 - much if there's not enough of a market
31:06 - out there that's not something you're
31:07 - going to be able to do at scale
31:09 - but the other aspect of scalability is
31:12 - the extent to which you can
31:15 - do the work without having to completely
31:16 - do everything over each time so in other
31:19 - words if you want to build a particular
31:21 - type of app for somebody
31:23 - and you realize it's a code base you can
31:25 - reuse and build similar apps for a large
31:28 - number of other people that's scalable
31:31 - because you're reusing that code base
31:32 - for similar customers over and over and
31:35 - over again so in other words you make
31:37 - more money off the second customer then
31:39 - you make off the first customer you make
31:41 - more money off the 10th customer than
31:42 - you make off the second one because
31:44 - you're refining this process every time
31:46 - because you're charging the same amount
31:47 - of money for the app each time right
31:49 - so scalability which again is size of
31:52 - the market and your ability to not have
31:55 - to replicate or to not have to
31:58 - start work over every time
32:00 - those are really how you look at the
32:02 - scalability aspect of this okay
32:05 - and number three in there again when
32:07 - deciding what services to offer is to
32:09 - what extent can you outsource some of
32:11 - this work
32:13 - even if you work 24 7 365 there are only
32:16 - so many hours in the day which means you
32:18 - can only take on so many customers if
32:20 - you want to make money as a freelancer
32:23 - and eventually
32:25 - scale up into a larger business you're
32:27 - going to have to get some of the work
32:29 - off of your plate so you can continue
32:30 - focusing on high value activities
32:33 - so
32:34 - when you're putting together a service
32:36 - that you're going to offer you need to
32:37 - say how much of this work can be
32:39 - performed by
32:41 - people
32:42 - that maybe have like entry-level coding
32:44 - skills
32:45 - how much of it can you outsource for you
32:47 - know like a decent price to other
32:48 - developers and so on so forth if for
32:51 - some reason you look at your service
32:53 - offering and realize it just cannot be
32:54 - outsourced
32:56 - in any way or that there aren't even
32:58 - components of it that can be outsourced
33:00 - that's probably not a good service
33:01 - offering to get into
33:03 - if you have something you're interested
33:05 - in if you have something you can scale
33:08 - and you have something where at least a
33:09 - good chunk of the work can be outsourced
33:11 - at a later time now you have something
33:13 - that a you can make a lot of money off
33:15 - of and b eventually scale into a larger
33:18 - business and that's why you're going to
33:20 - do that three-part analysis in deciding
33:23 - what services to offer within your
33:24 - nation again not to sound too repetitive
33:26 - but that three-part analysis is
33:29 - your level of interest the extent to
33:31 - which you can scale it out
33:33 - and the extent to which you can
33:34 - outsource some of this work
33:37 - so that's how you decide what you're
33:39 - going to offer once you've decided what
33:40 - you're going to offer it's important to
33:42 - look at how you're going to charge for
33:43 - it and i cannot stress enough it's
33:46 - important to charge flat fees or charge
33:49 - a set price for products as opposed to
33:51 - charging say by the hour
33:54 - charging by the hour would be
33:57 - you know telling someone you'll build
33:58 - them an app and you'll charge them x
34:00 - number of dollars per hour and at the
34:02 - end of the day you know you give them a
34:03 - bill
34:05 - and again the problem with this is the
34:07 - fact that there are only so many hours
34:09 - in a day you're trading time for money
34:11 - which is always a losing proposition by
34:13 - charging flat fees
34:15 - you get to take advantage of the work
34:17 - you have already done so for example if
34:20 - you build an app
34:22 - that serves a particular type of
34:23 - business you charge the business three
34:25 - thousand dollars for that app
34:27 - and then
34:28 - later on a second similar business comes
34:30 - along and wants a similar app
34:32 - you've already done a good amount of the
34:34 - work okay so
34:36 - you can reuse a lot of that code base
34:38 - and then charge three thousand dollars
34:39 - for an app the second time
34:41 - and the customer the second customer
34:44 - should say is still getting full value
34:45 - even though you're charging them three
34:47 - thousand dollars because they're getting
34:49 - the value of your expertise you became
34:51 - an expert in this area the first time
34:53 - you built the app they're getting the
34:54 - fact that you would have already worked
34:56 - any bugs out of the app because you
34:59 - probably debugged it as part of dealing
35:01 - with the first customer and so on so
35:03 - forth so by charging flat fees you what
35:06 - you make more per unit of your own input
35:08 - and you actually give better value to
35:10 - the customer so it's good for both sides
35:12 - you make more profits the customer gets
35:15 - a better experience
35:17 - and then the last thing i'll say when it
35:18 - comes to
35:20 - choosing what to offer
35:21 - pricing that offer is third thing would
35:24 - be the need to add recurring revenue and
35:27 - this is revenue where you don't
35:29 - necessarily have to make a brand new
35:31 - sale every month in order to bring in
35:34 - some
35:35 - income into your business
35:37 - and one of our businesses for example
35:39 - we have virtual private servers and then
35:42 - we
35:42 - offer the clients the option to have us
35:45 - host their app on our servers which we
35:47 - do and then so we essentially resell
35:49 - server space and then the clients pay a
35:52 - flat fee for that every month so
35:54 - on top of the fact that we just have
35:56 - money coming in every month for new
35:58 - sales to new customers there's a certain
36:00 - aspect that we can just count on coming
36:02 - in every month
36:04 - you know again for that recurring
36:05 - reselling revenue having recurring
36:07 - revenue really helps to kind of take out
36:09 - some of the highs and lows of working
36:11 - for yourself otherwise you might have
36:13 - months where you make a whole lot and
36:14 - months where you make a little having
36:16 - that recurring revenue really gives you
36:18 - some flexibility to let you kind of go
36:20 - along
36:21 - with your business okay so we've just
36:23 - talked about what services to offer how
36:26 - much to charge and we've talked about
36:28 - the need for recurring revenue so
36:31 - with all of that said let's get on to
36:33 - the next part of our video
36:44 - okay now that we've talked about what
36:46 - services you're going to offer and how
36:48 - you're going to charge for those
36:49 - services we need to talk about actually
36:51 - forming your business and this is going
36:53 - to be the last part of our discussion in
36:55 - the planning stages of starting your own
36:57 - freelance enterprise okay
36:59 - so
37:00 - forming your business really takes on a
37:02 - couple of different things number one is
37:05 - choosing the type of business entity
37:07 - you're going to use for
37:08 - your company and number two is actually
37:12 - getting it formed uh
37:14 - here's the one thing i want to stress
37:15 - before i get into these is
37:18 - this video should not be considered
37:19 - legal advice
37:21 - i'm not holding myself out as someone
37:23 - licensed to give you advice in forming a
37:26 - company on legal consequences and things
37:28 - of that sort those are things that
37:30 - should really be discussed with an
37:32 - attorney
37:33 - i cannot stress that enough that there
37:36 - can be serious consequences to
37:38 - choosing the wrong wrong form i should
37:40 - say for your business so it's always
37:42 - good to
37:44 - discuss these kinds of matters with a
37:45 - business lawyer
37:47 - when it comes to
37:49 - picking a business entity it's not a
37:50 - matter of just running out and starting
37:53 - to service clients once you decide to
37:55 - become a freelancer
37:57 - in most places you're going to need some
37:59 - kind of a business license okay working
38:01 - without that business license can be a
38:03 - crime in some places and usually is
38:06 - but also you want to really start to
38:08 - think about forming a company and in
38:10 - other words instead of just going out
38:12 - and
38:13 - getting a business license and working
38:14 - as a sole proprietor
38:16 - there can be benefits to forming a
38:18 - company such as a corporation or an llc
38:20 - which is a limited liability company
38:22 - um forming an s corp or forming some
38:25 - other kind of corporate entity
38:27 - again the kind of it that excuse me the
38:29 - kind of entity you choose is going to
38:32 - depend on the overall goals of your
38:34 - business and that's why it's best to
38:36 - talk to a lawyer what we do in our
38:38 - company is we've chosen to operate as an
38:41 - llc a limited liability company
38:45 - the benefits of an llc are number one it
38:48 - is an actual separate entity in other
38:50 - words it's considered a separate legal
38:52 - entity from my partners and i so what
38:55 - the llc means is that when our customers
38:59 - sign a contract they don't sign it with
39:01 - us as individuals they sign it with the
39:03 - llc they don't pay us as individuals
39:05 - they pay the llc when
39:08 - business expenses come up they don't get
39:10 - paid by us personally they get paid by
39:13 - the llc the llc has its own bank account
39:15 - and things of that nature um if the if
39:19 - you know we need a contract for services
39:21 - like if we have to rent server space the
39:23 - llc signs the contract with somebody
39:26 - else not you know we don't sign that as
39:28 - individuals
39:30 - the many benefits of having an llc
39:33 - include protections from liability so
39:36 - like let's say for example we were to
39:38 - sign a long-term contract with a vendor
39:41 - let's say we signed uh signed up for
39:43 - server space and had to sign a one year
39:45 - commitment for that
39:47 - and let's say after six months
39:50 - for whatever reason our business fails
39:51 - and we don't want to be in business
39:53 - anymore and the server space vendor
39:55 - decides to
39:57 - try to take us to collections or to even
39:59 - sue us to collect the rest of the money
40:01 - they were owed they could only sue the
40:03 - llc they could not sue us as individuals
40:05 - generally speaking so in other words it
40:07 - protects your individual credit your
40:09 - individual assets and um things of that
40:13 - nature can also protect you
40:15 - under the right circumstances from
40:17 - liability from your clients so you know
40:19 - if a client ever comes along and says
40:20 - hey you know i hired joe developer to do
40:23 - the software work for me and he bungled
40:25 - my app and i'm suing them for damages
40:28 - well if they're contracted with an llc
40:29 - generally speaking they can sue the llc
40:31 - and not the individual so having an llc
40:35 - really does provide you
40:37 - with liability protection which can be
40:39 - really crucial when you're going into
40:40 - business
40:42 - one of the other big benefits of having
40:43 - all
40:44 - an llc which again is what we have
40:47 - is that comes with several tax
40:48 - advantages
40:50 - namely allows you to save on uh what
40:53 - would be self-employment taxes that you
40:55 - would pay if you're just working as a
40:56 - sole proprietor
40:58 - the discussion on how uh
41:01 - having an llc can save you on
41:03 - self-employment taxes it can be quite
41:06 - lengthy and i've actually done a
41:07 - separate video
41:08 - on that previously for free code camp
41:10 - we're going to link to that video in the
41:12 - description below okay so when you're
41:14 - trying to decide what to do i would
41:16 - suggest watching that video but again
41:17 - the first thing i would suggest you do
41:19 - is talk to some kind of business law
41:21 - attorney or corporate counsel on what is
41:23 - the best fit for your particular
41:26 - situation in your particular location to
41:28 - meet your particular goals
41:30 - so
41:31 - the one thing i want to stress in this
41:33 - is
41:34 - don't just run out and start doing work
41:37 - figure out what kind of entity it is you
41:39 - should probably form and get that entity
41:42 - formed before you
41:43 - go out and
41:45 - and get the appropriate licenses before
41:47 - you go out and start trying to
41:50 - hustle up work for your new business
41:52 - so
41:53 - now that we've talked about the need to
41:55 - form some kind of business sanity or to
41:57 - minimum get the appropriate licenses
41:59 - we're all done talking about the
42:01 - planning stage for your new business
42:03 - your new business is officially planned
42:04 - congratulations it is now time to
42:07 - actually get started on doing some work
42:08 - and making some money so let's get to it
42:22 - okay at this point of our video we've
42:24 - just talked about the planning stages of
42:25 - your business in other words you've
42:27 - decided to become a freelance developer
42:29 - and you've done all that initial
42:31 - planning
42:32 - so you can have a business that's going
42:34 - to run well and run properly and be well
42:36 - thought out and you're not just going to
42:37 - go out and try to open up your own shop
42:39 - and haphazardly go about your business
42:41 - in other words because you've planned
42:43 - things out you're set up for success
42:46 - now we need to talk about some things
42:47 - you need to do initially to actually get
42:49 - the doors open to your new enterprise
42:51 - okay
42:52 - and those three those
42:54 - areas that you need to get knocked out
42:57 - first are going to really fall into two
42:59 - categories one is administrative tasks
43:02 - that you need to get set up and ready to
43:04 - go before you start taking customers and
43:06 - the second is marketing items that you
43:09 - need to get set up and ready to roll
43:11 - before you start taking customers
43:13 - and the third thing i would say you need
43:15 - to do on top of those is before you even
43:17 - start taking a customer is decide right
43:19 - now you're going to be a continuous
43:21 - learner and i'll talk about all three of
43:24 - these in a minute and what i mean by
43:26 - each of them but the one thing i want to
43:28 - stress before we get into
43:30 - your checklist and things to do when it
43:32 - comes to starting your own business
43:34 - is the importance of starting off on the
43:36 - right foot okay in other words you need
43:39 - to have
43:40 - all your
43:41 - administrative and clerical and legal
43:43 - requirements met before you start taking
43:46 - customers you need to have a lot of your
43:48 - marketing infrastructure in place before
43:51 - you go out and start taking customers
43:54 - and you also need to be just learning
43:55 - about new things before you start taking
43:57 - customers the reason i say especially
44:00 - when it comes to
44:01 - your administrative and marketing stuff
44:03 - that you need to have these things
44:04 - organized and have all your ducks in a
44:06 - row before you really start trying to
44:08 - run your business is because if you
44:10 - don't get these things organized now
44:12 - then running your business later is
44:14 - going to be
44:16 - much harder just think of it like this
44:18 - um you know you don't get you don't get
44:22 - very well organized uh when you start up
44:25 - shop as a result there were documents
44:28 - you were supposed to file with the irs
44:30 - or the secretary of state that didn't
44:33 - get filed but then you just started
44:34 - taking customers right and then you're
44:37 - right in the middle of a coding project
44:39 - and you get a notice from the secretary
44:41 - of state that some items need to be
44:43 - taken care of immediately otherwise you
44:45 - will no longer be legally allowed to do
44:47 - business
44:49 - this means you would have to stop your
44:50 - coding project in the middle of what
44:51 - you're doing to go deal with an
44:53 - administrative headache that should have
44:54 - been dealt with before as a result
44:58 - your project's probably going to be
44:59 - delayed to the client the client is
45:01 - going to be unhappy you may have to give
45:02 - them a partial discount if not
45:05 - a refund and it's just going to create a
45:07 - whole host of headaches for you okay so
45:10 - in other words by having all your
45:12 - administrative tasks lined up completed
45:16 - those initial tasks just done and
45:18 - organized
45:19 - you help avoid those fires from popping
45:22 - up later that you then have to stop what
45:23 - you're doing and put out and by being
45:25 - organized in the beginning you make more
45:28 - money later and the same is true with
45:29 - your marketing if you've got your
45:30 - marketing infrastructure in place then
45:32 - you don't have to stop what you're doing
45:34 - later in in a mad panic to try to drum
45:36 - up clients okay
45:37 - so
45:39 - the one thing again i just cannot stress
45:41 - enough is
45:42 - get your all your get all your ducks in
45:44 - a row and get organized before you even
45:47 - start taking customers so again let's
45:49 - look at it from an administrative
45:51 - standpoint a marketing standpoint and
45:53 - then things you need to be learning
45:54 - about on an ongoing basis
46:06 - okay when starting your company there
46:07 - are going to be several essentially what
46:09 - i call administrative tasks that you're
46:11 - going to need to get taken care of and
46:13 - out of the way and again as i stress in
46:15 - the introduction of this section you
46:16 - want to get these tasks taken care of
46:18 - now so that they don't become problems
46:20 - later so by getting all these things out
46:23 - of the way you can actually focus on the
46:25 - important thing which is doing dev work
46:27 - okay
46:28 - so there's a few different things you
46:30 - want to get out of the way up front
46:32 - number one is you got to decide if
46:35 - you're going to form a company or work
46:36 - as a sole proprietor i talked at a
46:38 - previous section of this video
46:41 - about why we use an llc in our business
46:44 - talk with an attorney or a lawyer um you
46:46 - know get a consultation with a business
46:48 - law lawyer about whether you should form
46:51 - a corporation whether you should form an
46:52 - llc uh you know uh whether you form some
46:56 - kind of partnership in other words talk
46:57 - to an attorney to see what's best for
47:00 - your particular situation uh we use an
47:02 - llc in our business and i know a lot of
47:04 - times that's what an attorney is going
47:06 - to suggest to you but talk to a lawyer
47:07 - and figure out what actually is the best
47:10 - course for you given your particular
47:11 - needs your particular circumstances the
47:14 - laws and regulations of where you live
47:16 - and so on and so forth
47:18 - so number one is get your company formed
47:20 - but
47:21 - after your company is formed it's
47:24 - important to make sure that you're
47:25 - keeping up with the
47:26 - business requirements of wherever you
47:29 - live so for example in ohio where i live
47:32 - once you form your company and you get
47:33 - your business license you don't need to
47:35 - renew your business license every year
47:37 - but there are other states where you do
47:39 - need to renew your business life license
47:41 - every year in nevada
47:43 - for example along with renewing your
47:45 - business license every year you have to
47:46 - file what's called a list of officers
47:49 - every year so the reason i'm telling you
47:51 - all this is
47:53 - the
47:53 - to stress the importance of the fact
47:55 - that
47:56 - the rules and regulations you have to
47:58 - follow are going to be different
47:59 - depending on where you live so it's
48:02 - really important that you know the
48:04 - regulations and rules of where you live
48:06 - and you keep up with them and again
48:07 - having a lawyer will help you to do
48:09 - these things
48:10 - if you don't keep up
48:12 - with those regulations and you might
48:13 - lose your ability to do business um if
48:16 - you're you know if you're in a place
48:17 - that you have to renew your business
48:19 - license every year and you don't renew
48:21 - it you may actually be committing a
48:22 - crime by engaging in business without
48:25 - having the appropriate licensing so in
48:27 - addition to getting your company formed
48:30 - make sure you're
48:32 - aware of your local regulations and that
48:33 - you're keeping up with them so number
48:35 - one is decide what kind of entity you're
48:37 - going to form and keep up with your
48:40 - local rules and regulations
48:42 - number two is to get a separate address
48:44 - for your business
48:47 - generally speaking i personally consider
48:49 - it a bad idea to use your home address
48:51 - as your business address there's no
48:53 - reason you can't but that means for
48:55 - example putting your home address on
48:57 - your company website that means putting
49:00 - your home address on any contracts you
49:03 - sign with clients that means having
49:04 - business mail
49:06 - come to your house so on so forth
49:09 - for just personal peace of mind reasons
49:11 - it can be a good idea to have a separate
49:14 - address for your business and then also
49:16 - if you're going to be forming a separate
49:18 - entity like an llc there may be other
49:20 - benefits to having a separate address
49:22 - and you'd want to talk about those
49:25 - benefits with an attorney as well
49:27 - in terms of where to have a separate
49:29 - address uh lots of uh
49:32 - excuse me
49:33 - lots of freelance developers will use
49:36 - just a post office box since a lot of
49:38 - freelancers are working out of their
49:39 - house if you're working at a shared
49:41 - space such as a wework or a regis a lot
49:44 - of times you can have that shared office
49:45 - space and receive mail there so if
49:48 - you're considering one of those kinds of
49:49 - spaces ask them what kind of services
49:52 - they offer in terms of you know using uh
49:55 - their addresses your business address
49:56 - receiving mail there and
49:58 - things of that nature so post office box
50:01 - some kind of shared office space
50:04 - there in other words there are low cost
50:06 - options for having a separate mailing
50:08 - address
50:09 - for your business
50:11 - third thing is to get a separate bank
50:13 - account for your company for this you'll
50:15 - need an ein from the irs that's an
50:18 - employer identification number you'll
50:20 - need that ein if you are starting a
50:23 - separate entity such as an llc or
50:25 - corporation or something like that
50:28 - you want to have a separate bank account
50:29 - for your business for a few reasons
50:32 - number one if you're starting a
50:34 - separate entity such as an llc or
50:36 - corporation
50:37 - that entity is a separate you know
50:40 - essentially a separate person from you
50:42 - so your bank account needs to be kept
50:44 - separate from that
50:45 - number two it helps you keep your book
50:47 - straight in terms of
50:49 - uh what's a personal expense and um
50:51 - what's a business expense number three
50:53 - having a separate account for your
50:55 - business allows you to stay a lot more
50:56 - disciplined
50:58 - when it comes to budgeting your business
51:00 - finances
51:01 - one of the biggest reasons though for
51:02 - having a separate bank account is the
51:04 - legal reasons that an attorney will tell
51:06 - you about you protect yourself and your
51:08 - business by
51:10 - having a separate account for your
51:11 - business and that is something to talk
51:14 - about with a lawyer
51:15 - after you've started a bank account and
51:18 - you know you've got your business
51:19 - address and all that stuff there are
51:21 - certain software
51:23 - software services and just professional
51:25 - services you want to sign up for
51:28 - you know for your new business and that
51:29 - brings us to the fourth thing on my list
51:31 - which is software and services that you
51:34 - need to sign up for the first of those
51:36 - is to get some type of a business suite
51:38 - such as g suite from google or office
51:40 - 365 from microsoft
51:43 - these will make it much easier for you
51:44 - to have a branded email
51:46 - so in other words instead of
51:49 - you know
51:50 - instead of your personal email or
51:51 - instead of new developer at gmail.com
51:54 - you know you can actually have an email
51:56 - on your own domain which you don't have
51:57 - to have a business suite like g suite in
51:59 - office 365 to do this obviously but it
52:02 - makes managing your email easier and the
52:03 - big benefit of those
52:05 - types of business suites is they include
52:07 - other services such as
52:09 - uh calendaring uh uh cloud drive storage
52:13 - and a few other things that are specific
52:15 - to business um i'd
52:17 - they're relatively inexpensive and i
52:19 - would strongly suggest signing one of
52:21 - them up we use g suite in our business
52:23 - and it makes our life a whole lot easier
52:26 - you want to sign up for your accounting
52:28 - software that is
52:30 - uh you know how you're going to do your
52:32 - bookkeeping there are a lot of options
52:34 - here there's quickbooks online there's
52:36 - wave apps there's freshbooks we
52:38 - personally use wave in our business i
52:40 - find it to be very easy to use and the
52:42 - price is right because it's free
52:44 - for you know for certain services so
52:47 - again we use wave but that's not what
52:49 - you have to use but definitely you want
52:51 - to sign up for accounting software um
52:54 - you know so you can do your uh
52:56 - you know so you can do your uh
52:57 - bookkeeping i can't stress enough the
52:59 - importance of regular bookkeeping and
53:01 - that's something we'll talk about a
53:03 - little bit later in this video the next
53:06 - thing you want to sign up for is credit
53:07 - card processing uh you know you sign up
53:10 - for square uh get credit card processing
53:12 - through into it wave who we do our
53:14 - accounting through also offers credit
53:16 - card processing
53:17 - your clients are going to pay you with a
53:19 - credit card or debit card the
53:21 - overwhelming majority of the time um and
53:24 - so a you want to have something where
53:25 - you can send them an online online
53:27 - invoice all the services i just
53:28 - mentioned do that you want them to be
53:30 - able to pay it online with credit card
53:31 - or a debit card one of the reasons i say
53:34 - to get this set up now even if you don't
53:36 - have a customer is
53:38 - just think about it for a minute it's a
53:39 - little bit awkward if
53:41 - client number one calls you talks to you
53:43 - on the phone says okay i want you to
53:46 - build my app you tell them it's three
53:47 - thousand dollars and they say great send
53:49 - me an invoice and you don't even have
53:51 - your software set up yet to send them
53:53 - the invoice so in other words get your
53:55 - software set up now and your billing set
53:57 - up now and your credit card processing
53:59 - all set up now
54:01 - and you can send them the invoice right
54:03 - away it doesn't take long to get this
54:05 - stuff signed up so just get it done now
54:07 - there is no reason to be doing it later
54:10 - when you know when you need to send some
54:11 - to the client just get out of the way
54:12 - and sign up right now
54:14 - the next software next service i should
54:17 - say you're going to want to sign up is a
54:18 - payroll service we use the full service
54:21 - payroll
54:23 - offerings from intuit which is the
54:25 - parent company of quickbooks
54:28 - if you are starting an llc an s corp
54:31 - or uh an llc to be taxed as an s corp i
54:34 - should say or a corporation you're going
54:37 - to need to pay yourself as an employee
54:39 - and again the specifics of that or
54:41 - something to talk about with a lawyer
54:43 - but you are going to need to pay
54:45 - yourself as an employee in addition to
54:48 - taking distributions from the business
54:50 - and
54:52 - once you start doing payroll as an
54:54 - employee you'll find there is just a lot
54:56 - of paperwork that's got to be filed with
54:57 - the irs get filed with the state and
55:00 - your local governments and all that fun
55:01 - stuff
55:02 - by having a payroll service to do that
55:04 - for you you save a massive amount of
55:06 - time
55:07 - we pay a fee every month
55:10 - to intuit full service payroll and they
55:12 - take care of all of our paperwork for us
55:14 - i mean 100 of it and it just makes our
55:17 - life so much easier it is so worth the
55:20 - cost and it allows us to stay in
55:22 - compliance in terms of everything we
55:24 - need to be filing
55:25 - in terms of payroll so there are other
55:28 - services you're going to need to sign up
55:30 - for and other software products you're
55:31 - going to need to
55:33 - sign up for but the ones i would stress
55:35 - immediately to make sure you're ready to
55:37 - roll with are again
55:39 - your business suites this is g suite
55:41 - office 365
55:43 - zoho any of those companies that have
55:45 - similar offerings excuse me your
55:48 - accounting software we use wave but
55:50 - again there's offerings such as
55:52 - quickbooks online uh freshbooks and
55:54 - several others sign up for a credit card
55:56 - processor such as with uh stripe
55:59 - wave
56:02 - square
56:03 - uh into a cr into it credit card
56:06 - processing any of those and the fourth
56:08 - one um on that list is to get signed up
56:10 - for a payroll service i just cannot
56:13 - stress all those things
56:14 - enough
56:16 - the next thing you're going to want to
56:17 - do as part of your administrative task
56:20 - getting going this is the fourth thing
56:22 - on our list remember first one was get
56:24 - your company an entity formed and know
56:25 - your licensing requirements second one
56:28 - was get your business address third one
56:30 - was get your bank account set up
56:33 - fourth one i'm i'm sorry so fourth one
56:35 - was your software and services fifth
56:37 - thing you're going to want to do
56:39 - is
56:40 - uh get your contracts ready these are
56:42 - the contracts you're going to send to
56:44 - customers so in other words let's say
56:45 - i'm your customer i call you i say i
56:47 - want you to build an app for me and then
56:49 - uh you give me a quote me three thousand
56:52 - dollars i say great send me over a
56:54 - contract so i can sign it this is a form
56:56 - contract that you will send me
56:59 - or mostly form contract at least that
57:00 - you would send me to
57:03 - for me to sign agreeing that you're
57:05 - going to do the work and what i'm going
57:06 - to pay you and so on so forth
57:09 - there are places you can get these types
57:10 - of contracts such as legalzoom
57:13 - there are problems with
57:14 - just getting forms off the internet
57:16 - though they may not be the right call
57:18 - for your situation it is very much worth
57:21 - the money to pay a small business lawyer
57:23 - to look over some for
57:25 - form contracts for you and give you some
57:27 - feedback and help you make sure you're
57:29 - on the right track in terms of the forms
57:30 - you're sending off to potential clients
57:32 - to sign so
57:34 - you know like i said you can pull a form
57:36 - off of legalzoom
57:38 - my strong advice would be to talk to an
57:39 - attorney though and have them go over
57:41 - any contracts uh that you may be
57:43 - thinking of putting in your document
57:45 - bank to send the clients and then you
57:47 - know once the attorneys reviewed them
57:49 - you know you can start sending them off
57:51 - and because contracts are so important
57:53 - in your business
57:54 - what we're going to do is at the end of
57:55 - this section of our video we're going to
57:57 - have a separate lecture from an attorney
57:59 - named carrie ross carrie is a business
58:01 - law attorney in the dayton ohio area and
58:04 - she's been kind enough to put together
58:05 - some information on things to look out
58:07 - for and to make sure of when you're
58:09 - putting together the contracts
58:12 - the next thing and last thing on my list
58:14 - to sign up for and this is item number
58:16 - seven
58:17 - is insurance for your business
58:20 - uh specifically professional liability
58:22 - insurance
58:23 - what this is some what this does i
58:25 - should say is it allows you to be
58:27 - protected from liability in the event
58:29 - that one of your customers ever sues you
58:31 - so let's say you know a customer hires
58:33 - you to build a website and they say hey
58:37 - you know you did something wrong as a
58:39 - result they don't appear in search
58:40 - engines or
58:42 - um you know they hire you to build an
58:44 - app and
58:46 - they claim you did something wrong and
58:47 - they lost business as a result of it and
58:49 - then they want to sue you
58:52 - having insurance it means that you could
58:54 - just turn the lawsuit over to your
58:56 - insurance
58:58 - even if you don't agree with the lawsuit
58:59 - again your insurance will cover it and
59:01 - your insurance would pay all your legal
59:03 - bills i mean we've never been sued in
59:05 - our business
59:06 - but given a really small cost of
59:08 - carrying insurance it just lets me sleep
59:10 - better at night so i think right now our
59:13 - premiums just went up so right now we're
59:15 - paying call it a hundred dollars a year
59:17 - it's really not very much at all in the
59:20 - grand scheme of things so sign up for
59:22 - professional liability insurance um for
59:25 - your business uh just call geico or you
59:28 - know any similar company and
59:30 - they can get you pointed in the right
59:31 - direction as to who you want to sign up
59:33 - for with that so your administrative
59:36 - tasks again to get out of the way before
59:39 - you even start taking customers are get
59:41 - your company formed and know your
59:44 - legal requirements get a business
59:46 - address get a business bank account get
59:48 - your required or needed software and
59:50 - services signed up get uh your contracts
59:54 - that you're going to be sending clients
59:55 - ironed out preferably reviewed by an
59:58 - attorney and also get an insurance
60:01 - policy signed up and as i mentioned a
60:04 - moment ago let's get to attorney kerry
60:05 - ross for her lecture on contracts in
60:07 - your business
60:24 - hi my name is carrie ross i'm a business
60:27 - attorney and an estate planning attorney
60:29 - with ross legal services in dayton ohio
60:32 - i've been asked to speak with you today
60:34 - about the importance of written
60:36 - contracts in your software development
60:38 - business
60:39 - we're going to talk about a few key
60:41 - points in this segment
60:43 - first the importance generally of
60:46 - well-written contracts throughout all
60:48 - aspects of your business and then
60:49 - specifically in connection with your
60:51 - software development services
60:53 - second we'll talk about typical formats
60:56 - for
60:57 - development service contracts and some
60:59 - key provisions that you may want to
61:00 - include in your form to use with your
61:02 - clients
61:04 - last we'll talk about some resources
61:05 - available to you
61:07 - for purposes of preparing your contract
61:10 - to use with your clients
61:12 - the first thing i'll say is
61:14 - having a well-written contract
61:16 - is very important
61:18 - for all aspects of your business
61:20 - you might be entering into a lease for
61:23 - office space employment agreements
61:25 - hiring your own independent contractors
61:27 - or simply purchasing goods
61:30 - in each case
61:32 - review the contract negotiate it make
61:35 - sure that the final product matches what
61:37 - your intentions are so that the contract
61:39 - cannot be questioned
61:42 - a purpose of a contract is to
61:44 - memorialize your business transaction
61:46 - it's your reference guide throughout an
61:49 - ongoing transaction if there's a
61:51 - question about who's obligated to do
61:53 - what and when
61:55 - it's also your first line of defense in
61:57 - the event of a dispute your contract may
62:00 - even have provisions that say what to do
62:03 - in the event of a dispute do you have to
62:05 - go to arbitration for example or are
62:07 - there notice requirements before you can
62:09 - take any kind of legal action
62:13 - when not reduced to writing
62:15 - a handshake deal or something you've
62:17 - agreed to via email or if it's just
62:21 - poorly written in a written contract
62:24 - you're open to
62:26 - disputes he said she said problems
62:28 - coming up down the road
62:30 - including maybe not getting paid maybe
62:32 - having to sue someone or being sued for
62:35 - breach of contract or maybe additional
62:38 - damages and sometimes it's all of the
62:40 - above
62:41 - a real world example in the software
62:44 - development field
62:45 - would be if you agreed to develop an app
62:48 - for a customer
62:49 - and it has certain functionality
62:51 - delivery dates you comply with all of
62:53 - that
62:54 - at the end of the agreement once you've
62:56 - delivered your app and been paid you're
62:59 - asked to provide ongoing maintenance and
63:01 - rather than memorializing the terms of
63:03 - that specifically in a contract
63:06 - you think that everything's gone well
63:08 - with this customer you agree to provide
63:09 - maintenance
63:11 - two or three years go by
63:13 - and all of a sudden the technology on
63:15 - which your app was based is being phased
63:18 - out it no longer functions
63:20 - and your client is looking to you to say
63:23 - g as part of your maintenance maybe you
63:25 - need to rebuild the entire app and you
63:28 - may say well that wasn't in the scope of
63:30 - the maintenance agreement so where do
63:32 - you look you look at your written
63:33 - contract and if you haven't memorialized
63:35 - the terms of that clearly you could be
63:37 - left in a lurch
63:39 - so at this point let's turn our
63:41 - attention to
63:42 - the typical format for software
63:44 - development contracts and some key
63:46 - provisions you may want to include
63:58 - so as we discussed in the last section
64:00 - your written contract with your customer
64:02 - is going to be the place where you
64:03 - protect your business's interest and in
64:06 - the context of app development or
64:09 - software development you're protecting
64:12 - you your talent is what's delivering the
64:14 - project and the product at the end of
64:16 - the day so that's really what your
64:18 - contract is geared to protect
64:21 - clients will ask you to provide a
64:23 - contract nine times out of ten unless
64:25 - you're working with the microsoft's or
64:28 - amazons or large development houses of
64:30 - the world
64:32 - your clients will not normally have
64:33 - their own development contract form so
64:36 - you want to be prepared when you make
64:38 - that sales pitch in advance so that
64:40 - you're not holding up your sales process
64:42 - or closing your deal
64:44 - because you need to go back to the
64:45 - drawing board and come up with your own
64:46 - contract
64:48 - if a client does present you with their
64:50 - own form it's really important to read
64:53 - this closely understand what you're
64:54 - agreeing to
64:56 - before you finalize it
64:58 - you may not feel like you have that much
65:00 - leverage and you may not
65:02 - but as long as you know what you're
65:03 - signing ahead of time and make sure that
65:05 - it's not going to impact your activities
65:07 - going forward then that's important
65:10 - things to watch out for would be
65:12 - restrictive covenants that prevent you
65:14 - from
65:16 - creating the same or similar
65:18 - software or applications for people in
65:22 - competing industries
65:23 - so non-competes non-solicitations those
65:26 - types of things should really be watch
65:28 - outs
65:30 - the common format that i typically see
65:33 - for services agreements
65:35 - is an independent contractor agreement
65:37 - plus a statement of work that is
65:39 - attached to the back of it you can call
65:41 - it an independent contractor agreement
65:43 - you can call it a services agreement
65:45 - software development agreement that
65:47 - really doesn't matter as much as the
65:48 - fact that you're going to have your
65:50 - general basic terms that stay for the
65:53 - most part the same from customer to
65:55 - customer in your independent contract
65:57 - agreement and this attachment on the
65:58 - back where you can customize the
66:00 - transaction to match what you're
66:02 - actually being asked to perform
66:05 - common provisions that you would see
66:07 - within the independent contractor
66:09 - section clearly you're going to identify
66:11 - the parties the date you're signing the
66:13 - agreement in each of these right off the
66:15 - bat
66:16 - but in the contractor agreement section
66:18 - you'll cover things like termination
66:20 - rights who has the right to end the
66:22 - contract for what reasons and what
66:25 - procedures in place when that happens do
66:28 - you get paid for partially completed
66:30 - work
66:30 - or how does that work
66:33 - things like insurance
66:35 - indemnification obligations where you're
66:38 - risk sharing with the other side in case
66:40 - something goes wrong those would be
66:42 - negotiated in your independent
66:43 - contractor agreement
66:45 - if you're granting any warranties for
66:47 - your work or specifically saying you're
66:50 - not granting warranties for your work
66:52 - that's typically handled in this section
66:54 - as well
66:56 - a word of caution there depending on
66:58 - where you are most state statutes have
67:01 - specific requirements that imply certain
67:04 - warranties unless you disclaim them
67:05 - specifically and if you are going to
67:08 - disclaim them you may have to write that
67:10 - in a certain way in your agreement to
67:12 - make it enforceable so please check in
67:15 - with local council or really do some
67:17 - statutory research if you have that
67:19 - available to you to make sure you're
67:21 - complying with the restrictions
67:23 - you may also handle things such as the
67:25 - venue for any lawsuits that potentially
67:28 - come up
67:28 - governing law that would apply to your
67:30 - contract particularly if you're located
67:33 - in different states than your customer
67:36 - or alternative dispute resolution
67:38 - provisions that may require arbitration
67:40 - or mediation prior to
67:43 - starting a lawsuit
67:45 - now the statement of work
67:47 - is the juicy part this is where you get
67:49 - to customize the work or customize the
67:52 - language to match the work you're
67:54 - performing so you really want to get
67:56 - into the deliverables here in specific
67:59 - detail what are your deliverables and
68:02 - when are you expected to deliver them is
68:04 - this
68:05 - a
68:05 - pretty specific
68:07 - project that's due all at one time is it
68:10 - a phased timeline for delivery
68:13 - what is due when
68:14 - and what are your obligations
68:17 - related to that payment terms you want
68:20 - to make sure that you're specifically
68:22 - saying when you want to get paid and for
68:24 - what if you're delivering parts of the
68:26 - project along a timeline will you get
68:28 - paid as those things get delivered do
68:31 - you get paid on an hourly rate a flat
68:33 - fee rate
68:34 - what are the terms of your payment and
68:36 - when are they due
68:38 - and keep in mind if this is your form
68:40 - start where you want the payment terms
68:42 - to start and let your customer negotiate
68:45 - a change from there if needed
68:48 - you may want to deal with specifically
68:50 - customer responsibilities depending on
68:53 - what you're doing you may need the
68:55 - customer or a customer representative
68:57 - assigned to you
68:58 - to provide you with information or
69:01 - access to systems to make sure their app
69:03 - works what happens if they don't do that
69:06 - and that delay is your timeline are you
69:07 - responsible or are they responsible
69:10 - here is also the place where you deal
69:12 - with ongoing obligations
69:15 - after the ultimate project is delivered
69:17 - will you be maintaining the project are
69:19 - you responsible for updates for the
69:21 - project
69:23 - do you have any kind of other ongoing
69:25 - application or i'm sorry ongoing
69:27 - obligation
69:28 - uh after the delivery is done
69:31 - so these are the kinds of things that
69:32 - you're going to want to really nail down
69:35 - inside of your independent contractor
69:37 - agreement and the attached scope of work
69:51 - so
69:52 - now we've gone over the need for written
69:54 - contracts throughout your business and
69:56 - we've specifically talked about the
69:58 - format you may want to use and some
70:00 - provisions that you might include in
70:02 - your software development agreement to
70:03 - be used with your own clients
70:06 - this may seem pretty overwhelming at
70:08 - this point a lot to think about the good
70:10 - news is there are some resources
70:12 - available to help you as you start to
70:14 - develop your own form the first and most
70:16 - obvious choice is to contact an attorney
70:19 - to help prepare the contract on your
70:21 - behalf you can explain your needs what
70:23 - the contract will be used for and have
70:26 - the attorney prepare that with those
70:27 - views in mind
70:29 - this may not be in your budget i
70:31 - understand that it is possible to
70:33 - negotiate a flat fee with a lot of
70:36 - attorneys which may save you some money
70:38 - over an hourly rate arrangement it may
70:40 - also be possible to negotiate a reduced
70:44 - rate for a start-up business
70:46 - if this is still not within your budget
70:48 - i would encourage you to contact your
70:50 - local chamber of commerce or if you have
70:53 - like we do in dayton

71:14 - numerous internet resources that you can
71:17 - use to start a form
71:20 - such as nolo.com might be a good
71:22 - starting point you can find these forms
71:25 - and i keep stressing starting point
71:27 - because as i mentioned in the previous
71:28 - segment there are specific statutory
71:31 - requirements depending on what kind of
71:34 - services you'll be offering and what you
71:36 - want your contract to cover i would
71:38 - encourage all of you to at least have an
71:40 - attorney read your form remembering that

71:48 - over again with your clients

71:54 - contact me directly good luck
72:05 - okay a big thanks to kerry for talking
72:07 - about the importance of contracts and
72:08 - what to look for in a written contract
72:10 - now let's talk about what you need to be
72:12 - doing to market your new business
72:21 - okay now that you're ready to start up
72:22 - as a freelance developer let's talk
72:24 - about some things you need to get out of
72:26 - the way immediately so that you'll be
72:27 - able to market your business
72:29 - properly and there are other items other
72:32 - than the ones i'm going to talk about
72:34 - which you'll need however these are just
72:35 - the ones i'm stressing in this video
72:38 - some of them may seem obvious but you
72:39 - would be surprised how many people
72:41 - decide to open up their doors without
72:43 - having all these items
72:45 - for lack of a better word ready to go so
72:48 - let's go over a few things to make sure
72:50 - you have you know before you start
72:51 - trying to market yourself to customers
72:53 - number one is you need a website for
72:56 - your new business number two is need a
72:58 - branded email you need a phone number
73:01 - uh you need to have business cards you
73:03 - need to sign up your various review
73:05 - profiles on uh websites such as google
73:08 - my business and
73:10 - yelp and
73:12 - things of that nature
73:13 - you need to flush out your linkedin
73:15 - profile
73:16 - and again these are just some of the
73:18 - must-haves i mean obviously
73:20 - there are other ones so
73:21 - let's go through each of these in turn
73:24 - number one
73:25 - start a start a website for your new
73:27 - development business you would be
73:29 - surprised i have actually seen people
73:31 - who go out and hold themselves out as
73:33 - freelance software developers freelance
73:35 - web developers and they haven't they
73:38 - have not actually put up a website for
73:40 - themselves or if they have just to be
73:42 - frank it looks like garbage so put up
73:45 - something nice um your website is
73:48 - important for multiple reasons number
73:50 - one it's essentially your storefront
73:52 - right
73:53 - think of it like this if you were going
73:55 - to hire somebody to build you a website
73:57 - would you be a little concerned if they
73:58 - didn't have a nice website for
74:00 - themselves of course you would so have a
74:02 - website up for yourself before you start
74:04 - trying to hustle up business
74:06 - and
74:07 - make it nice make it look like you
74:09 - actually know what you're doing make it
74:10 - look like it's something you actually
74:11 - care about
74:13 - if you're looking for inspiration or
74:15 - patterns or even
74:17 - some good foundational templates
74:19 - to use for a website for yourself i
74:21 - would suggest going to the website html5
74:24 - up
74:25 - these are free html5 templates that
74:29 - again are pretty good to use uh you know
74:32 - if you want to just get something up
74:33 - quicker and sooner rather than later
74:35 - again that website is html5 up
74:38 - or at a minimum
74:40 - you know if that's at a minimum i should
74:42 - say
74:43 - or build yourself something really nice
74:45 - from the ground up again this is you
74:48 - showing off yourself as a developer so
74:51 - have a website and make sure it looks
74:53 - nice
74:55 - number two is a branded email for your
74:58 - business
74:59 - um
75:01 - you gotta realize as a freelance
75:02 - developer you're gonna be dealing with a
75:04 - lot of people who can
75:06 - barely use a computer or barely use
75:08 - their newfangled smartphone so
75:11 - you know having a branded email goes a
75:13 - long way towards validating you with
75:15 - people
75:16 - um if you email somebody from
75:19 - you know your name at gmail.com you
75:22 - might as well be emailing them from
75:23 - brand new developer at gmail.com it goes
75:26 - a long way towards legitimizing you
75:29 - having a branded email we talked a
75:31 - little bit in the last section about
75:33 - signing up a business suite such as g
75:35 - suite or office 365 you'll get a branded
75:38 - email as part of that but don't start
75:40 - emailing potential clients and
75:41 - interacting with potential clients from
75:44 - um you know a free email account such as
75:46 - gmail yahoo you know outlook.com or
75:49 - anything like that the third thing to
75:51 - get is a phone number dedicated to your
75:54 - business
75:55 - there are a lot of reasons uh to keep
75:58 - your cell phone and your
76:00 - business line separate
76:02 - do you want your
76:04 - personal number on your website probably
76:06 - not uh
76:08 - there
76:09 - do you want to be able to go out at
76:11 - night and have your phone ring and not
76:13 - be sure if it's a customer or if it's
76:16 - just a friend of yours or a family
76:17 - member calling i'm sure you would like
76:19 - to be able to separate your work in your
76:20 - business lines
76:22 - fortunately having a separate business
76:24 - phone number doesn't require you to go
76:26 - out and pay for a second cell phone you
76:28 - certainly can if you want but you don't
76:29 - have to
76:30 - you can use a free service from google
76:32 - called google voice and that will allow
76:35 - you to essentially have a free
76:37 - voice over internet line
76:39 - that will go to your cell phone so
76:41 - you'll
76:42 - basically have two numbers on your cell
76:44 - phone google voice again is free
76:47 - you know you can talk and text talk text
76:49 - make calls from it receive calls um you
76:52 - know uh my wife has a google voice line
76:54 - uh for her business on her phone and
76:57 - it's free it's easy to use i mean i
76:59 - would suggest for uh your business phone
77:01 - number uh using google voice uh
77:04 - the next thing you're going to want to
77:05 - get is business cards
77:07 - you're going to be dealing especially as
77:09 - a freelance developer you're going to be
77:10 - dealing with or are likely i should say
77:13 - to be dealing with a good number of
77:15 - local businesses
77:16 - and
77:17 - it is important to be able to hand them
77:19 - a business card uh with that being said
77:22 - i personally don't think it's worth it
77:23 - to
77:24 - spend a lot of money on your business
77:26 - cards you can get something that's
77:27 - adequate from vistaprint
77:29 - you know usually 50 bucks for a few
77:31 - hundred cards uh
77:34 - but having a business card that you can
77:35 - hand out is definitely important you
77:37 - will be surprised at how many people say
77:39 - to you oh okay do you have a card and
77:41 - you looks kind of silly if you don't
77:43 - have a business card to hand them so
77:45 - have your business cards with you and
77:47 - you know like ready to roll before you
77:48 - even start trying to hustle up business
77:51 - the next thing you're going to want to
77:53 - do is get your various review profiles
77:55 - lined up these are your profiles on
77:58 - websites such as yelp um the review
78:01 - section of the facebook page for your
78:02 - new business uh the review section on
78:04 - google my business
78:06 - and things like that these are places
78:08 - where
78:09 - uh your customers will leave you good
78:11 - reviews you're going to want to ask them
78:13 - for reviews we'll talk about that a
78:14 - little later but as i said these are
78:16 - places for your customers to leave you
78:18 - good reviews after you've completed work
78:20 - for them
78:22 - it's important that you get these review
78:23 - profiles signed up
78:25 - and they be proactive about getting
78:26 - reviews from customers
78:28 - because
78:29 - there are there are meaningful number of
78:31 - people who will not want to hire you
78:33 - unless they can find
78:34 - good reviews um about your services
78:37 - and the reason i say to get your review
78:39 - profile signed up before you even get
78:41 - your first customer is because then you
78:43 - are ready to ask that customer for a
78:45 - review
78:46 - you don't want to you know finish your
78:48 - first customer's project and then you
78:51 - know and then um
78:53 - not be in a position to ask them for
78:54 - reviews because you haven't even signed
78:56 - up the profiles yet so before you even
78:58 - start going out and trying to hustle up
78:59 - business
79:01 - get your review profiles signed up the
79:03 - primary ones i would focus on are
79:06 - again google my business
79:08 - yelp uh the review section of your
79:11 - facebook page um you know those would
79:13 - probably be the big ones
79:15 - uh the next thing is to
79:17 - completely flush out and uh
79:20 - uh come and uh kind of
79:23 - make your linkedin profile look really
79:25 - nice and complete make it really clear
79:27 - what skills you have uh you know hey you
79:29 - know if you hey i know css i know
79:32 - javascript i know html
79:35 - you know i'm fluent in other languages
79:38 - make sure those are all listed on your
79:40 - linkedin profile make sure your linkedin
79:41 - profile says that you are available for
79:44 - uh freelance work any certifications
79:47 - you've gotten from free code camp make
79:48 - sure your list those are listed on your
79:51 - linkedin profile there are also
79:53 - quick certification tests you can take
79:55 - from linkedin for example uh they have
79:58 - one for css uh only takes a few minutes
80:00 - to do maybe a half hour to do the test
80:03 - and you'll have a
80:05 - note citation on your linkedin page
80:07 - saying that you're
80:08 - you're considered certified in css
80:11 - and if as i said have your profile say
80:13 - that you're available for freelance work
80:15 - and you'll be surprised at how many
80:16 - people just start randomly reaching out
80:19 - to you through linkedin
80:21 - um you know for potential freelance work
80:24 - and also link even if someone's not
80:25 - reaching out to you linkedin is
80:27 - a place where people are going to look
80:29 - to validate you in addition to looking
80:31 - at the
80:32 - review profiles i mentioned a minute ago
80:35 - so those are the initial must-haves in
80:38 - terms of
80:41 - being ready to market your new business
80:43 - again just going through them real fast
80:45 - in order get a website up
80:47 - go to a website such as html5 up if
80:50 - you're looking for inspiration or for
80:53 - a quick template you can grab
80:55 - get a branded email again g suite office
80:58 - 365 zoho those kinds of services uh are
81:01 - going to give you that anyway get a
81:03 - phone number for your business uh
81:04 - dedicated to your business uh i would
81:06 - suggest using google voice that's what
81:08 - my wife uses in her business i've used
81:10 - it in the past it's free so i don't
81:12 - really see any reason starting out to
81:14 - pay for something get business cards
81:16 - again something from vistaprint is
81:18 - typically fine get your review profiles
81:21 - signed up uh
81:24 - you know we're talking about uh yelp the
81:26 - facebook review section google my
81:28 - business and get your linkedin profile
81:30 - completely fleshed out and nicely filled
81:31 - out and you do those things and you're
81:33 - in a good spot to start marketing
81:36 - start i gotta stress marketing your
81:38 - business so
81:40 - with all that said let's talk about why
81:42 - the last stage of getting your business
81:45 - officially started is to begin a process
81:48 - of lifelong learning and then we'll be
81:50 - done with this module
81:58 - okay so the last part of getting your
82:00 - business started is
82:02 - recognizing that you are now going to
82:05 - have to be a lifelong learner if you
82:06 - want to be a successful freelancer
82:09 - and
82:10 - what do i mean by this i mean the fact
82:13 - that
82:14 - successful business people
82:16 - are always trying to learn about new
82:18 - topics uh rel that in some way relate to
82:21 - their business
82:22 - it is a mistake to think that
82:25 - okay i'm
82:27 - you know finishing or i have finished uh
82:29 - the coding education i'm going to do at
82:31 - free code camp and i'm now done and i'm
82:34 - ready to strike out into the world
82:36 - completing free code camp is not the
82:40 - end of uh
82:42 - learning how to code
82:43 - it is the beginning of starting a career
82:46 - as a coder in other words it is just the
82:49 - first step and now you've got to start
82:51 - learning about a whole lot of other
82:52 - topics if you want to be successful as a
82:55 - freelancer because what you will quickly
82:58 - find out and when i say quickly i mean
83:00 - almost immediately find out
83:02 - once you go out on your own is that
83:04 - there is a whole lot of things that
83:06 - going to be go into being a business
83:09 - person
83:10 - uh besides learning how to code so
83:13 - one thing i cannot stress to you enough
83:16 - is um
83:18 - in your spare time just be reading on a
83:19 - regular basis uh you know try to read 30
83:22 - to 45 minutes a day at a at a minimum
83:25 - and i gotta stress the at a minimum and
83:27 - when i say read i don't mean um
83:29 - you know just random articles and
83:30 - magazines or fiction books or whatever
83:33 - uh i would really suggest trying to
83:35 - learn um as much as you can about people
83:38 - who have been very successful in their
83:40 - fields look at what traits made them
83:42 - successful and then try to emulate those
83:44 - traits
83:45 - in your own business and there's also
83:48 - just a lot of other books you can read
83:49 - that
83:50 - help you figure out what it is that
83:53 - successful people do in terms of the
83:55 - habits they keep the thing i can't
83:57 - stress enough is that you would when you
83:59 - read about successful people and people
84:02 - who have
84:03 - achieved a lot what you will see is
84:06 - common patterns common behaviors and
84:08 - common habits between all of them and it
84:11 - is important to remember that
84:13 - those people don't have
84:15 - those habits because they're successful
84:17 - they're successful because they have
84:18 - those habits so if you choose to have
84:21 - those habits in your own business and in
84:23 - your own life you can be
84:25 - successful as well so
84:27 - my my advice is just read early read
84:30 - often um about people who have been
84:33 - successful in their field and it doesn't
84:34 - even have to be a successful software
84:36 - developer like bill gates i mean just
84:37 - people who have been successful in
84:39 - any kind of business
84:41 - a few books i would suggest to get
84:44 - started with if you haven't read these
84:46 - already
84:47 - number one is profit first
84:50 - what this is is a book that talks about
84:55 - essentially
84:56 - accounting in your business but also how
84:58 - to set up a financial budget for your
85:00 - business
85:01 - a lot of businesses go out of go out of
85:04 - business due to poor financial
85:06 - management and now that you're a
85:08 - freelancer you are a business person
85:10 - like it or not and you don't want your
85:12 - business to fail due to poor financial
85:14 - management profit first does a pretty
85:17 - good job of putting together a system
85:19 - that is easy for people to follow um
85:23 - so if you're somebody who already has a
85:25 - lot of discipline and is already really
85:28 - good with managing finances and
85:30 - you're good at keeping personal and
85:32 - business finances separate on top of
85:33 - that
85:34 - this may not be the book for you but
85:36 - that being said i am willing to put a
85:38 - large number of people watching this
85:40 - video would be open to admitting that
85:41 - they've struggled with personal
85:43 - financial management at some point so
85:45 - reading profit first is good in a sense
85:47 - that it will give you an easy to follow
85:49 - system and just follow the system and
85:51 - your business's finances will take care
85:53 - of themselves so profit first is book
85:55 - number one
85:57 - book number two is how to win friends
85:59 - and influence people
86:01 - this is a good one to read because it
86:04 - really goes a long way in terms of
86:06 - giving some tips that can be useful in
86:09 - dealing with potential customers dealing
86:11 - with people after they've become your
86:13 - customers
86:14 - dealing with other vendors and just
86:16 - individuals you're going to have to deal
86:18 - with in the business world on
86:20 - you know just on a daily basis while the
86:23 - book isn't specifically about dealing
86:24 - with people in a business setting it
86:26 - really gives a lot of great information
86:28 - on how to deal with individuals in
86:30 - different situations in a broader
86:31 - context and if you're somebody that
86:35 - feels like how do i endear myself to
86:37 - people how do i sell how do i make
86:38 - people want to hire me this is probably
86:41 - a good book to read so number two is how
86:43 - to win friends and influence people by
86:45 - dale carnegie
86:46 - number three is the millionaire next
86:48 - door
86:49 - this is a book in which
86:52 - many millionaires were studied over a
86:54 - long period of time and it'll really
86:56 - dispel a lot of
86:58 - common misperceptions about individuals
87:01 - who are millionaires how they became
87:03 - millionaires the habits of millionaires
87:05 - and things of that nature it'll also go
87:08 - a long way in showing how millionaires
87:10 - stay millionaires through certain
87:12 - financial habits
87:13 - i personally think this book should be
87:15 - required reading before anyone graduates
87:17 - from high school in the united states
87:20 - so it's one i certainly cannot suggest
87:22 - enough that people should be read
87:25 - reading
87:26 - number four is a small time operator
87:29 - this is a book that deals with small
87:31 - business in general
87:33 - um
87:34 - everything from habits you should be
87:36 - keeping uh in terms of financial
87:38 - management to day-to-day operations to
87:40 - getting your taxes paid on time to you
87:43 - name it for anyone who has never worked
87:45 - for themself and is now going out as a
87:46 - freelance developer small time operator
87:48 - is a must read
87:51 - number four is the
87:53 - i'm sorry number five
87:54 - is the innovators by walter isaacson
87:57 - this is essentially a history of uh
88:02 - computing and computer science and it
88:04 - goes all the way from the creation of
88:06 - the
88:07 - first computer and the concepts of the
88:09 - first computer of ada lovelace all the
88:11 - way up through
88:12 - essentially where we are today and it'll
88:15 - really give you an appreciation of how
88:18 - no one person not even steve jobs not
88:21 - even bill gates not even name an
88:23 - individual
88:25 - no one person had
88:27 - an outsized
88:29 - impact on computing and has really just
88:31 - been kind of a brick by brick building
88:33 - of
88:34 - uh
88:35 - you know of uh computer science from the
88:37 - from its founding and through now and it
88:38 - really just gives you an appreciation
88:41 - of uh what what different individuals
88:43 - has done it's an inspiring book to read
88:46 - and i i just think it's a muslim must
88:48 - read for anyone who's just learned to
88:50 - code and is striking out on their own
88:52 - and the final book i would suggest
88:54 - reading is the everything store which is
88:57 - a story about amazon and the founding of
88:59 - amazon by jeff bezos and how the company
89:02 - grew uh to where it is today the thing
89:04 - you will really take away from this book
89:06 - when you read it is that amazon got
89:09 - where it is today in large part by a
89:11 - never-ending focus on customer service i
89:13 - mean
89:14 - whether it's just you as a freelance
89:16 - developer
89:18 - you know
89:19 - in your basement writing code or whether
89:20 - you're jeff bezos writing amazon running
89:23 - amazon and everything in between
89:26 - customer service has to be your prep
89:27 - number one priority there's can be no
89:30 - other priority that comes before
89:31 - customer service and reading the
89:33 - everything store will really uh help you
89:36 - understand this so like i said these are
89:39 - just a few suggestions um to get started
89:42 - and i would really suggest reading 30 to
89:44 - 45 minutes a day um
89:46 - for those of you watching this video
89:49 - you know if we could line everybody up a
89:50 - year from now for people who have
89:52 - succeeded as a freelancer and people who
89:54 - haven't i guarantee you the people who
89:56 - have succeeded have probably read more
89:59 - consistently than the people who haven't
90:01 - so you know with all of that said let's
90:03 - move on to the next part of our lessons
90:13 - okay we're to the point of our lessons
90:14 - where we're going to talk about how to
90:15 - get clients for your new business after
90:18 - all as a freelance web developer
90:19 - freelance software developer you're not
90:21 - going to be in business very long if you
90:22 - don't have customers right so really
90:24 - we're going to look at a few things
90:26 - number one we're going to look at how to
90:27 - get customers in the short term because
90:30 - you need revenue today and number two
90:32 - we're going to look at how to build your
90:33 - business over the long term how you get
90:35 - customers over the long term is going to
90:37 - be very different than how you
90:39 - immediately get customers today for
90:41 - your short term startup business all
90:43 - right so
90:44 - before we dive into those let's look at
90:46 - number one why is it important to
90:50 - understand the difference between the
90:51 - long term and the short term and then
90:53 - let's quickly talk about how to sell
90:54 - your services to people once you
90:56 - understand the
90:57 - need to focus on the long term
91:00 - you'll see the difference between that
91:01 - and short-term business building and
91:03 - then you'll also see that once you know
91:05 - how to sell yourself to people you can
91:07 - just be far more effective in terms of
91:09 - growing your business so first
91:12 - the need to focus on both the short-term
91:14 - and the long term in your business
91:17 - the need to focus on the short term is
91:19 - obvious right because as i said a moment
91:21 - ago if you don't have customers today
91:22 - you're going to be in business for about
91:23 - 30 seconds so you need to get customers
91:26 - today no one disputes that
91:29 - you may not be taking your dream jobs
91:31 - you may not be getting
91:32 - the work that is your first choice but
91:34 - you need work so
91:36 - again you're gonna
91:38 - go about doing things to get work today
91:42 - that are
91:45 - getting you work through not necessarily
91:47 - the most uh how shall we say sustainable
91:49 - ways okay but again you need work today
91:52 - so that's what you're gonna do
91:54 - over the long term however you're going
91:56 - to build a brand meaning that you're
91:58 - going to build a business where instead
92:00 - of you going out and getting work
92:02 - through non-sustainable means people are
92:04 - just coming to you and you're getting
92:06 - the work without having to put much
92:07 - effort into getting it this is work that
92:09 - will be higher paying this is work more
92:11 - along the lines of what you want to be
92:13 - doing long term and more importantly
92:16 - if you're not putting time and resources
92:17 - into getting that work it becomes much
92:19 - more profitable for you so
92:22 - if you only focus on the short term
92:25 - you can get some business and that's
92:26 - what you're going to have to do in the
92:28 - beginning but if that is your sole focus
92:30 - and you're confident you're just
92:32 - constantly and i do mean constantly
92:34 - in that state of trying to hustle up new
92:37 - work looking for the next job things of
92:39 - that nature and you just never really
92:41 - get your business out of second gear if
92:43 - however you keep your focus on building
92:45 - a long-term brand you grow your profits
92:48 - in your business really fast so that's
92:50 - why it's important to in the short term
92:53 - go out and get some clients do what you
92:54 - have to do to hustle up work but also be
92:56 - building a long-term brand so
92:59 - i cannot stress that enough
93:01 - number two is how to actually sell
93:03 - yourself to customers
93:05 - and eat whether you're trying to sell
93:07 - the people in the short term or whether
93:09 - you're trying to sell the people in the
93:10 - long term i cannot stress enough
93:13 - that you need to view yourself as a
93:15 - problem solver we talked about this in
93:17 - an earlier section of the video when we
93:19 - were talking about the need to provide
93:21 - value to your clients
93:24 - when you are selling yourself to your
93:25 - clients and trying to sell your services
93:27 - to a client what you need to do is come
93:30 - to learn about the client's business and
93:32 - identify the client's problems and
93:34 - explain how your software is or your
93:37 - website or whatever you're building
93:39 - explain how your product is going to
93:41 - solve those problems okay don't come to
93:44 - them and say here's my experience here's
93:46 - what i've done
93:48 - say you have this problem here's how i'm
93:51 - going to solve it people are going to be
93:53 - much much much and i mean much more
93:55 - receptive to that kind of an approach
93:58 - and you'll wind up doing
93:59 - a lot more in sales
94:01 - this is something i talked about at
94:02 - length in a previous video for free code
94:04 - camp and we're going to link to that
94:05 - video in the description below so we
94:07 - don't rehash too much of it here but
94:09 - when selling yourself to customers i
94:11 - cannot stress enough present yourself as
94:13 - a problem solver so in short
94:16 - you need customers in the short term
94:19 - we're going to talk in a moment about
94:20 - how to get those
94:22 - it's important that you keep a focus on
94:24 - building your brand long term and when
94:26 - selling yourself to customers it's
94:28 - really important that you present
94:29 - yourself as a solver of their problems
94:32 - all right so with all that said let's
94:34 - get on to how to build your business
94:35 - over the short term
94:44 - okay let's take a few minutes to talk
94:45 - about some things you're going to do to
94:46 - get clients in the short term as we just
94:48 - said in our intro the need to get
94:50 - clients in the short term for your
94:51 - freelance business is obvious right
94:53 - because after all if you don't get
94:54 - clients immediately you're not going to
94:56 - be working for yourself for very long
94:58 - so in just a moment i'm going to get
95:00 - into five different ways that you can
95:02 - go about getting clients immediately
95:04 - getting customers today and generating
95:06 - some revenue before i get into that
95:08 - though the one thing i want to stress is
95:09 - that the things you're going to do in
95:11 - the short term to get clients are going
95:13 - to be a little more labor intensive and
95:15 - a little more costly than the things
95:16 - you're going to do
95:18 - over the long term to get your business
95:20 - and that's all right again
95:22 - these things like i said while they in
95:24 - the short term while they may be costly
95:25 - while they may be time intensive the
95:27 - bottom line is they're necessary
95:29 - because if you don't have clients today
95:31 - you are not going to do that very well
95:34 - and you're not going to be around for
95:35 - very long so let's look at five things
95:38 - you can do in the short term to get
95:41 - clients for your startup business
95:43 - number one is simply gonna be people you
95:46 - know and i'll talk about this in a
95:48 - minute you're just gonna put put out
95:50 - there to people you know that you're now
95:51 - engaging in this kind of work
95:54 - number two is to be lead websites such
95:57 - as upwork and fiverr we'll talk about
95:59 - those in a minute number three is going
96:01 - to be leveraging your linkedin profile
96:04 - number four and people are surprised
96:06 - when i say this is going to be
96:07 - leveraging websites such as craigslist
96:09 - and number five is gonna be good
96:11 - old-fashioned networking so let's go
96:13 - through each of these in turn
96:15 - number one is as i said just putting
96:18 - your name out there to people you know
96:20 - you would be surprised at how much work
96:22 - you can get by simply making everyone
96:25 - you know aware of the fact that you are
96:27 - now engaging in this type of work i'm
96:30 - not suggesting that you go around the
96:32 - friends and family members and
96:34 - continuously harass them into letting
96:36 - you do build them a website or letting
96:38 - you do something for them what i'm
96:40 - saying though is that you need to simply
96:42 - put out there hey just so you know i'm
96:44 - available to do this type of work let me
96:47 - give you a few examples of what i mean
96:49 - by that in one of our businesses
96:52 - our main service is building websites
96:54 - for
96:56 - very small to medium-sized companies and
96:58 - usually you know kind of like the small
97:00 - mom-and-pop shops type companies
97:02 - so
97:03 - just as an example when we started that
97:06 - business i made i just kind of casually
97:08 - mentioned to one friend of mine hey just
97:10 - so you know we're going to be doing this
97:12 - type of work you know like etc etc
97:15 - if you know anybody that needs that kind
97:16 - of work just let me know and very
97:19 - quickly that friend said to me
97:21 - that her her mother had actually
97:23 - recently started a church and then we
97:24 - wound up building a website for the
97:26 - church i also mentioned to a neighbor
97:29 - that i was doing this type of work and
97:31 - very quickly that led to another
97:33 - referral the same thing and i had
97:35 - similar situations with other people
97:37 - that we knew
97:38 - so when i told people hey we do this
97:41 - kind of work that was going to be the
97:43 - only time i tell them i'm not going to
97:44 - like sit there and tell them over and
97:46 - over i'm not going to like harass them
97:48 - i'm not going to sit there and say just
97:49 - a reminder i do this kind of work just
97:51 - casually make people aware
97:53 - that you're doing this type of work and
97:55 - do it in a way where you don't sound
97:56 - like you're trying to sell them
97:57 - something again hey just letting you
97:59 - know and you will be surprised how
98:01 - quickly referrals can come in that way
98:04 - as i said we started that little side
98:05 - project business i just talked about and
98:07 - very quickly we started getting
98:08 - referrals simply by letting people i
98:10 - know
98:11 - know that we were doing this kind of
98:12 - work so just putting yourself out there
98:15 - like that can go a long way and i can't
98:17 - stress that enough as
98:19 - a place to start
98:20 - the second place to
98:23 - look for
98:24 - getting clients for your business is
98:26 - lead service websites such as upwork and
98:28 - fiverr what
98:30 - up work is it's a website where
98:33 - essentially people looking for services
98:36 - such as web development or software
98:37 - development will go on upwork
98:40 - state what it is they want and what
98:42 - they're willing to pay and then you can
98:43 - go online and bid on the job a lot of
98:46 - times you'll be
98:47 - bidding on work at a dollar amount for
98:50 - which is way less than what you would
98:51 - normally charge for this kind of work
98:53 - but again in the beginning it's
98:55 - work so you know it can generate some
98:57 - revenue for you while you're getting
98:59 - started
99:00 - the thing that i would say is important
99:02 - to do when you're using websites such as
99:06 - upwork from tac
99:08 - things of that nature is to make sure
99:11 - that your profile on the site is fully
99:13 - completed make sure you list all your
99:14 - experience include examples of your work
99:16 - and um things of that nature make sure
99:19 - make sure people review you on those
99:21 - sites after they're happy with your
99:23 - services all those kinds of things will
99:25 - make your bidding process
99:27 - more effective so
99:29 - the upside of these kinds of services is
99:32 - the fact that
99:33 - people go on there looking for the
99:35 - services you're providing so it makes
99:38 - finding a customer a lot easier the
99:40 - downside is again you're working for a
99:42 - reduced rate a lot of the time and
99:44 - you're also paying for the lead so it's
99:47 - not going to be the most profitable
99:48 - thing in the world but in the short term
99:49 - it is work to do and it is money to be
99:52 - made
99:52 - another option as i mentioned a second
99:54 - ago is fiverr fiverr works a little
99:56 - different than a website such as upwork
99:58 - what fiverr is is
100:00 - you essentially go online create a
100:02 - profile people can come to your profile
100:04 - and say what they're willing to pay and
100:06 - then
100:07 - fiverr will take a cut of that so
100:11 - again you're usually going to wind up
100:12 - working for reduced rates on a website
100:15 - such as fiber and on top of that you're
100:17 - paying a percentage to fiber so
100:20 - when you're looking at those kinds of
100:21 - things it's important to consider the
100:22 - reduced profitability weight against the
100:25 - fact that the customers are typically
100:27 - being or essentially i should say being
100:29 - brought to you so again pros and cons on
100:31 - those
100:32 - third thing on our list is leveraging
100:34 - linkedin it's really important to on
100:38 - your linkedin profile
100:39 - make sure that you are stating that you
100:42 - are a freelance developer that you work
100:43 - for yourself put the name of your
100:44 - business on there and make sure you list
100:46 - in your bio and in your bylines that you
100:49 - are available to do this kind of work on
100:51 - a freelance basis
100:52 - make sure you're including all your
100:54 - qualifications uh include examples of
100:56 - your work on your linkedin profile and
100:58 - there is such a shortage right now of
101:00 - software developers and web developers
101:03 - that you will be surprised at how many
101:04 - people will reach out to you and ask if
101:06 - you are available to
101:08 - do work for them so linkedin is a good
101:11 - way uh to get business again just as i
101:14 - said make sure your profile is filled
101:17 - out all the way on there
101:19 - number four and this is one that people
101:22 - kind of raise an eyebrow when i say it
101:24 - is to
101:25 - have a nice ad on your local craigslist
101:28 - section so for example if you live in
101:32 - name of city go on the name of city page
101:34 - for craigslist
101:36 - and you know under certain the services
101:38 - section you can put in that you are
101:41 - available to do web design or whatever
101:42 - kind of work it is you're doing
101:45 - don't just put up a quick craigslist
101:46 - post saying
101:48 - that hey i do this work call me at this
101:50 - number
101:51 - actually take the time write out a nice
101:54 - ad put it on craigslist include a
101:55 - graphic uh
101:57 - the craigslist supports a graphic uh at
101:59 - a width of 450 pixels at a height of 600
102:02 - pixels put a nice graphic on there
102:04 - put
102:05 - as i said a nice ad on there and you
102:08 - will be surprised at the fact that you
102:09 - get some calls through there
102:11 - to this day craigslist remains a
102:14 - highly valuable and highly underutilized
102:17 - resource for getting work
102:19 - now the work you're going to get through
102:20 - craigslist is not going to be the most
102:22 - profitable type of
102:24 - work there is these are typically going
102:26 - to be
102:27 - low dollar websites um you know people
102:30 - want to spend a few bucks for just some
102:32 - basic coding or something like that
102:34 - again it's not you're certainly not
102:36 - going to get rich off it's not going to
102:37 - be all the money in the world but it
102:38 - only costs you five dollars to run the
102:40 - ad and
102:41 - you will get some work out of that
102:44 - the important thing is to post
102:45 - consistently and to stick with it
102:48 - the last thing on our list
102:51 - is good old-fashioned networking and by
102:53 - networking i mean going out and meeting
102:56 - with other business owners to drum up
102:59 - work for yourself
103:01 - what i don't suggest for networking is
103:04 - going door-to-door or going around at
103:06 - different kinds of businesses trying to
103:08 - introduce yourself i also don't suggest
103:11 - going to functions that are mostly
103:13 - attended by other developers
103:16 - that is something i see in a lot of
103:17 - different professions so for example
103:19 - attorneys tend to network with other
103:21 - attorneys
103:22 - uh you know accountants tend to network
103:25 - with other accountants a lot of software
103:27 - developers tend to network with other
103:28 - software developers and to be honest
103:30 - that's just not a very effective way of
103:33 - leveraging networking into getting
103:35 - customers instead what you want to be
103:37 - doing is
103:39 - meeting with people who in turn work
103:41 - with your customers so for example if
103:44 - you are
103:46 - let's say
103:47 - starting up a freelance web design
103:48 - business and
103:50 - what you might want to do is get hooked
103:52 - up with a digital marketer who doesn't
103:54 - actually do web design but maybe manages
103:56 - pay-per-click or something for somebody
103:58 - those type of people are almost always
104:00 - looking for people to build websites on
104:02 - behalf of their clients so that would in
104:03 - turn be
104:05 - a good referral source for you
104:07 - one of the best ways
104:09 - or i should say best resources
104:12 - to
104:13 - find good networking opportunities is a
104:15 - group called bni that's business
104:16 - networking international they're
104:18 - throughout the united states and with
104:20 - lots of local chapters and pretty much
104:22 - everywhere so
104:24 - go on bni's website and find local
104:26 - chapters in your area and join up there
104:29 - is an annual fee for joining bni it is
104:31 - well worth it
104:33 - the idea of bni is
104:36 - has a few aspects to it number one
104:38 - is they only allow
104:41 - one person in a chapter per an area so
104:44 - for example if you join bni as a web
104:46 - designer they're not going to allow
104:48 - another web designer in that chapter so
104:51 - which a lot gives you some exclusivity
104:53 - and
104:54 - for obvious reasons is good for you
104:57 - and then you'll have a chapter with one
104:59 - web designer one auto mechanic one
105:01 - accountant one finance manager one
105:05 - local doctor just name that one real
105:08 - estate agent just name the type of
105:10 - business and he will have one of each in
105:11 - there and then once you attend it and
105:13 - then you'll attend weekly meetings and
105:15 - once you attend these weekly meetings
105:17 - the goal of bni is for
105:19 - everybody in the group to essentially
105:22 - open up their referral books to one
105:24 - another so in other words
105:26 - you are
105:28 - a web designer in the bni group
105:30 - friend of yours needs an auto mechanic
105:32 - you refer them to the auto mechanic in
105:34 - the bni group
105:36 - the auto mechanic nobody knows somebody
105:38 - who
105:39 - needs their house painted so he refers
105:41 - them to the house painter in the bni
105:44 - group it turns out that there's a
105:47 - doctor in the or
105:50 - you know physician in the bni group
105:53 - and
105:54 - it turns out he knows somebody that
105:55 - needs a website he just refers the site
105:59 - he refers them to you so in other words
106:02 - it's not something where
106:03 - person one and person two are directly
106:05 - referring things to each other all the
106:07 - time it's just that everybody in the
106:08 - group is referring things to other
106:10 - people in a group and a lot of that
106:12 - business will have a way of coming back
106:13 - to you
106:14 - so attending a networking group such as
106:16 - bni is a really good start for a way to
106:20 - get business in the short term
106:23 - networking can be very very time
106:25 - consuming so that is why i've got it on
106:28 - our list of things to do to build
106:29 - business in the short term it is a very
106:32 - time consuming so
106:33 - a lot of people like to say well i go
106:36 - out and i network because it's free well
106:38 - it's only free if you value your time at
106:40 - zero okay and your time is worth a whole
106:42 - lot more than zero so in the short term
106:45 - networking functions and networking
106:47 - events and joining networking groups is
106:49 - an okay way to get business but as you
106:51 - build a brand long term those are things
106:53 - that you're going to want to get away
106:54 - from
106:55 - so to sum up we're really talking about
106:58 - five ways
106:59 - to
107:00 - build business and grow your company
107:02 - over the short term
107:04 - number one is people you know as i said
107:07 - just put it out there that you're doing
107:08 - this kind of work you know uh don't
107:10 - harass your friends it's a good way to
107:12 - make sure they're not your friends
107:13 - anymore
107:14 - number two
107:15 - excuse me is using services such as
107:19 - upwork thumbtack and fiverr
107:21 - number three is leveraging linkedin
107:24 - number four is a website such as
107:26 - craigslist and number five is good
107:28 - old-fashioned networking so now that
107:31 - we've gone over all of those let's talk
107:33 - about how it is you're gonna build your
107:35 - brand over the long term which will
107:37 - greatly increase your profits
107:46 - okay let's talk about building your
107:47 - business over the long term now and
107:49 - having a long-term sustainable business
107:52 - is going to look a lot different than
107:54 - the things you're doing to get business
107:56 - in the short term
107:57 - as we talked about in the last section
107:58 - of our video your short-term business
108:00 - activities are really going to focus on
108:02 - using lead websites going to networking
108:04 - events things that are either very
108:06 - expensive things that are very time
108:08 - consuming things that lead to you taking
108:11 - work at reduced rates
108:13 - those are all good ways to make a few
108:15 - bucks today to keep your new business
108:17 - running and to help you make a little
108:19 - extra money while you're focusing on
108:21 - building a long-term brand
108:23 - the reason why building a long-term
108:25 - brand is so important is having an
108:28 - actual brand that you have ownership and
108:30 - control of allows you to number one
108:34 - charge more for your services you'll
108:36 - actually be charging more of what you
108:37 - deserve to be making for the work you're
108:39 - doing
108:40 - number two
108:41 - it also allows you to save time and
108:44 - resources on getting work in other words
108:47 - instead of you putting out money instead
108:49 - of you putting out a lot of time to get
108:51 - work people are going to be coming to
108:53 - you so think of it like this people
108:54 - coming to you and saying let me pay you
108:56 - full price as opposed to you going to
108:58 - people and saying
108:59 - here's uh reduced work i can do so for
109:03 - obvious reasons having a brand is way
109:06 - way way and a whole bunch of ways more
109:09 - profitable than the things you're going
109:11 - to need to do in the short term so while
109:14 - you're engaging in those short term
109:16 - activities
109:17 - that we talked about in the our last
109:20 - section i cannot stress enough that you
109:22 - need to be making time for the long term
109:24 - activities that were
109:26 - about to talk about and if you don't
109:29 - make time for those long-term activities
109:32 - next thing you know you've been
109:33 - freelancing and working for yourself for
109:35 - five years and you are still
109:37 - engaging in those short-term activities
109:39 - and not making very much money
109:41 - that can be a trap that is actually very
109:43 - easy for people to fall into so the best
109:46 - thing you can do is just set aside the
109:48 - time every week to say you know what i
109:50 - don't care how busy i am i'm going to
109:53 - focus on these
109:54 - long-term activities so what are the
109:57 - long-term activities that
110:00 - you're going to engage in to
110:02 - make sure you're building a brand and
110:03 - that you're charging more for your
110:04 - services and that you're not putting
110:06 - time and effort into
110:07 - getting customers number one is simply
110:10 - building a referral base and we'll talk
110:12 - about that in a second number two is
110:14 - going to be leveraging a blog for
110:16 - yourself and number three is going to be
110:18 - leveraging platforms such as youtube if
110:21 - you focus on these three things then
110:23 - next thing you know like i said people
110:24 - are coming to you instead of you going
110:26 - to them and people are paying you more
110:28 - instead of less
110:29 - so let's look at each of these in term
110:32 - again number one is simply getting
110:35 - referrals from people and getting repeat
110:37 - business referrals and repeat business
110:39 - i'm saying that so saying that so many
110:41 - times because it's so important it's so
110:42 - important i'm going to say it again
110:44 - referrals and repeat business
110:46 - here's the important thing to understand
110:48 - about getting referrals from former
110:50 - customers and having other former
110:52 - customers come back to you to do
110:53 - additional work in the future
110:57 - when you look at very successful
110:58 - businesses
111:00 - they don't get a proportionately higher
111:03 - number of phone calls and what i mean by
111:05 - that is let's say you've got developer
111:07 - one and developer two here's developer
111:09 - one here's developer two
111:12 - this developer does
111:15 - five times the revenue every year of
111:17 - this developer let's go with 5x that
111:20 - does not mean that this developer gets
111:23 - five times as many
111:24 - brand new client calls
111:26 - every month as this developer if you
111:29 - want to get to where you are making
111:31 - substantially more than other people you
111:34 - have to do it by
111:36 - getting referrals from former customers
111:38 - and getting repeat business from former
111:40 - customers it is simply too expensive and
111:42 - too time consuming to constantly be
111:45 - getting brand new business that's not
111:47 - stemming from work you have already done
111:49 - it's just not possible to succeed
111:51 - without doing that think of it in these
111:54 - terms
111:55 - a customer comes to you
111:58 - wants a website you build it for three
112:00 - thousand dollars right you do a really
112:02 - good job for that customer
112:04 - three to six months later that customer
112:07 - refers you to somebody
112:09 - you then build that person a website for
112:10 - twenty five hundred dollars
112:12 - three to six months later that second
112:15 - customer the referred one they refer you
112:17 - somebody
112:18 - you build that one
112:20 - website for say three thousand dollars
112:24 - your marketing or whatever you're doing
112:25 - to get clients from the outside world
112:28 - only yielded one phone call it yielded
112:30 - the phone call from the very first
112:31 - customer however by doing good work that
112:34 - one customer turned into three new
112:35 - customers or i'm sorry two new customers
112:37 - and a total of three customers
112:39 - and as a result of that you also have
112:42 - three potential referral sources out
112:44 - there right now all from one phone call
112:46 - right
112:47 - and some of that
112:48 - can also happen with repeat business and
112:51 - so on so forth in other words if you get
112:54 - one phone call you do a great job for
112:55 - the person and over the course of three
112:58 - or four years you know you do three or
112:59 - four different projects for that person
113:01 - one phone call yielded three or four
113:03 - different jobs essentially so
113:06 - that kind of an approach and focusing on
113:08 - referrals and repeat business is the way
113:11 - to grow your business exponentially
113:14 - so how do you make sure you're getting
113:15 - referrals and repeat business
113:18 - well it may sound simple but you'd be
113:19 - surprised the first thing is good
113:21 - old-fashioned customer service
113:23 - call people back
113:24 - return respond to people's emails
113:27 - be honest with them about how long
113:29 - something is going to take
113:31 - do what you're say you're going to do if
113:33 - you tell somebody you're going to have
113:35 - something done by thursday have it done
113:36 - by thursday if you're not going to have
113:38 - it done by thursday make sure you call
113:40 - them thursday and or email them thursday
113:43 - and explain to them that this isn't done
113:45 - i'm sorry here's why it's not done
113:47 - here's when it will be done don't make
113:49 - them chase you around saying hey you
113:51 - said this was going to be done on
113:52 - thursday where is it good old-fashioned
113:54 - customer service and saying
113:57 - that that what you're going to do and
113:59 - doing it
114:00 - are the most sure-fire ways to lead to
114:03 - that repeat business and those referrals
114:06 - that we just talked about i cannot
114:07 - stress this enough
114:09 - you may think duh when i'm saying
114:11 - provide good service to people but you
114:13 - would be surprised at
114:15 - how few people out there actually
114:17 - provide the kind of service that you
114:18 - would probably want to receive yourself
114:20 - so going that extra mile going above and
114:23 - beyond can really go a long way and as
114:27 - simple as that sounds
114:29 - it takes work to you got to remember it
114:30 - takes work to provide good customer
114:32 - service right so do that work and put in
114:34 - the time and you will be shocked at how
114:36 - fast your business grows um
114:38 - and this is true whatever industry
114:40 - you're in whether you're a freelance
114:41 - developer of some sort whether you're a
114:44 - real estate agent whether you are
114:46 - you know
114:47 - an accountant or some other type of
114:49 - professional i just cannot stress enough
114:51 - good service leads to a whole lot more
114:54 - business and that is how you grow your
114:56 - business exponentially through referrals
114:58 - and repeat business so that's number one
115:02 - number two for building your freelance
115:03 - business over the long term is
115:05 - leveraging a blog
115:07 - and by this i mean you need to be
115:09 - blogging regularly attach your blog to
115:11 - your website you need to be blogging
115:13 - regularly on issues important to your
115:15 - customer base
115:16 - one of the big mistakes a lot of people
115:18 - make with a blog is
115:20 - they start writing on things that they
115:22 - think are interesting
115:23 - the focus of your blog needs to be
115:24 - providing useful information to your
115:26 - customer base and this is something i
115:29 - see all the time
115:31 - like for example i have on our blog
115:34 - on our business for our business which
115:36 - deals primarily with software answers
115:38 - for law firms we have provided a lot of
115:40 - information about how law firms can be
115:43 - more efficient in their day-to-day
115:44 - operations we've written a lot of
115:46 - information about
115:49 - how they can leverage different software
115:51 - applications in a law firm and so on so
115:54 - forth
115:54 - attorneys doing google searches on
115:57 - making their practices more efficient
115:58 - then land on those articles and they
116:01 - explore our blog further
116:03 - when they start to look at some of the
116:04 - solutions we provide they realize that
116:06 - they may need our services and they pick
116:07 - up the phone and call us so in other
116:09 - words by providing useful information
116:12 - to our customer base through a blog our
116:15 - customer base lands on our website they
116:17 - then turn and they in turn then call us
116:20 - so leveraging a blog that provides
116:23 - useful information to your customers is
116:26 - one of the best ways to get business and
116:28 - this winds up being incredibly time
116:30 - effective there are blog posts that i
116:32 - wrote three four five even in some
116:34 - instances even six years ago that are
116:37 - still yield still yielding phone calls
116:39 - to our business today so in other words
116:41 - a couple hours to write a blog post five
116:44 - years ago
116:45 - people are still calling us because we
116:46 - own it no one can take it away from us
116:49 - okay that is incredibly time effective
116:51 - in terms of
116:52 - going out and getting a business
116:54 - in addition to a blog another great
116:56 - source to leverage is youtube uh youtube
116:58 - is one of the most popu actually one of
117:00 - the most popular search engines in the
117:01 - world people go on youtube all the time
117:03 - looking for information if you're gonna
117:05 - do a youtube channel to drum up business
117:08 - the thing i cannot stress enough is just
117:11 - like with a blog
117:12 - provide information that is useful to
117:14 - people so again provide information that
117:17 - your potential customers are looking for
117:20 - so for
117:21 - example let's say
117:23 - you want to focus on
117:25 - websites for small businesses
117:28 - which is something we do in one of our
117:30 - businesses i'm just using this as an
117:32 - example i want to build websites for
117:34 - small businesses i start a youtube
117:35 - channel on it
117:36 - a lot of small businesses might be
117:38 - trying to do their own website say with
117:40 - wix or like wordpress or something like
117:43 - that and then they'll get frustrated
117:45 - with it and
117:47 - maybe decide to call a developer
117:49 - so what we can do in our business is do
117:51 - a youtube channel on how to's like
117:53 - here's how to do x in your wix website
117:55 - here's how to do why in your wordpress
117:58 - website and then those
118:01 - small businesses
118:02 - start to use our youtube channel as a
118:04 - resource to meet their needs and over
118:06 - time when they realize that wix and
118:08 - wordpress actually can't meet their meet
118:10 - their needs fully or their needs go
118:11 - beyond wix or wordpress they then turn
118:14 - around and call us because we're the
118:15 - people they've been getting information
118:17 - from
118:17 - this whole time so again providing
118:19 - useful information to people is the best
118:23 - way to
118:24 - leverage a youtube channel so
118:27 - doing these three things i've just
118:28 - talked about
118:30 - really again i can't stress enough
118:31 - allows you to build a brand
118:33 - it results in people coming to you
118:35 - instead of you going out hustling up
118:36 - work and it allows you to charge more
118:38 - for your work
118:40 - so while you're growing your business in
118:42 - the short term and while you're doing
118:43 - the things you need to do to get clients
118:45 - in the short term the things you need to
118:47 - be focusing on
118:49 - is
118:50 - making sure you're building a referral
118:51 - base and a repeat business base and you
118:54 - do that by providing the absolute
118:55 - highest levels of customer service
118:58 - meeting your deadlines and doing the
118:59 - things you say you're going to do
119:01 - you want to leverage a blog
119:03 - again while you're busy in your business
119:04 - you need to make sure you're setting
119:06 - aside time to blog and that you're
119:08 - writing on issues that are answering
119:10 - your clients questions addressing your
119:12 - clients concerns and providing the kind
119:14 - of information your potential clients
119:16 - are looking for you want to apply that
119:18 - same approach to the third thing which
119:20 - is a youtube channel and again providing
119:22 - value and usefulness to people is the
119:24 - best way to make sure that
119:27 - they are
119:28 - excuse me that they are
119:30 - potentially interested in calling you
119:32 - if you do these three things
119:35 - you start to see yourself as i said
119:36 - having a brand
119:38 - that in turn leads to more leads to much
119:40 - more money it also leads to you having
119:41 - much more time because you're not doing
119:43 - things like going to networking events
119:44 - and
119:45 - the other things that you have to do to
119:46 - get business in the short term
119:49 - so with all of that said let's move on
119:51 - to the next part of our video which is
119:54 - how to go about managing your business
119:56 - on a day-to-day basis
120:06 - okay we're on to the part of our video
120:08 - where we're going to talk about managing
120:09 - your business on a day-to-day basis and
120:12 - we're going to break that down into two
120:14 - parts first we're going to talk about
120:17 - managing your administrative tasks on a
120:19 - day-to-day basis and by administrative
120:21 - tasks i mean anything that is not
120:23 - actually related to development
120:26 - things such as filing your businesses
120:28 - taxes doing your bookkeeping filing
120:30 - paperwork with your secretary of state
120:32 - so on so forth so managing those kinds
120:34 - of tasks and the second thing we'll talk
120:36 - about
120:38 - will be managing your substantive work
120:39 - on a day-to-day basis and your
120:41 - substantive work is the actual
120:43 - development work and you want to make
120:44 - sure you're doing that in a way
120:46 - that yields as much profit as possible
120:48 - so we'll talk about administrative and
120:50 - substantive and how to make sure you're
120:52 - managing yourself now before we get into
120:55 - those two things the biggest point i
120:57 - want to stress is that it's time for you
120:59 - to start thinking of yourself as a
121:00 - business person it's really common for
121:03 - me to have conversations with
121:05 - self-employed individuals who will say
121:07 - something like well i'm not a business
121:09 - person i'm a software developer or i'm
121:12 - not a business person i'm a real estate
121:15 - agent or i'm not a business person i'm
121:16 - an attorney or something like that
121:19 - once you start working for yourself if
121:22 - you take the attitude of
121:24 - you know i'm not a business person i'm
121:26 - an ex
121:28 - then you really don't need to worry
121:29 - about being a business person and i say
121:31 - that because you're going to be out of
121:32 - business so fast that the problem of
121:34 - being a business person will take care
121:35 - of itself
121:37 - and when i say that i don't mean it to
121:39 - sound to flip but
121:42 - it really is true and the people who
121:45 - succeed as freelance developers and
121:48 - essentially and eventually i should say
121:50 - grow their freelance business into a
121:52 - real business are the ones who
121:53 - understand that
121:55 - as soon as you strike out on your own
121:56 - whether you have one customer whether
121:58 - you're running microsoft you are now in
122:00 - business for yourself
122:02 - okay so you need to understand that
122:05 - things like working efficiently and
122:06 - dealing with your administrative tasks
122:08 - those aren't optional these are things
122:10 - you're going to have to do and you just
122:12 - don't have a choice in the matter
122:13 - anymore and that is a choice you made
122:15 - once you decided to strike out on your
122:17 - own so understand that you are a
122:19 - business person doing so will one
122:21 - allow you to stay in business and to
122:24 - allow you to make a lot more money so
122:26 - with all that said let's move on to how
122:28 - to manage your administrative affairs on
122:30 - a day-to-day basis
122:39 - okay so we're going to talk about the
122:40 - importance of dealing with your
122:41 - business's administrative affairs on a
122:44 - day-to-day basis and the reason i am
122:47 - talking about this first
122:49 - before i get into talking about how to
122:51 - manage your substantive work is that the
122:55 - administrative work is a crucial topic
122:57 - to
122:58 - address lots and lots and lots and a
123:01 - whole bunch of lots of businesses
123:03 - especially freelance developers get
123:06 - themselves in trouble
123:07 - not because they're bad at development
123:09 - or they service their customers poorly
123:11 - it's because they do a really bad job at
123:13 - their administrative work and then that
123:14 - creates problems down the road for
123:17 - example suppose
123:19 - just as a hypothetical you need to file
123:21 - a document with the secretary of state
123:23 - and you fail to do so and you're right
123:26 - in the middle of a coding project for
123:28 - somebody and because you didn't file
123:30 - that document to secretary of state six
123:32 - months later while you're in the middle
123:33 - of that coding project
123:35 - a notice shows up from the secretary of
123:37 - state saying you've lost your right to
123:39 - legally do business so now you need to
123:41 - put that coding project on hold
123:44 - and take a day or two to deal with uh
123:47 - your administrative snafu
123:49 - as a result of this you miss a deadline
123:51 - to the customer the customer is unhappy
123:54 - uh you know obviously the customer is
123:55 - never going to refer you anybody the
123:57 - customer is never going to uh you know
124:00 - come back to you again for more work and
124:03 - that's just a simple example of how not
124:05 - dealing with administrative tasks can
124:08 - get in the way of you doing your
124:10 - substantive work and i totally
124:13 - understand
124:14 - that it's not fun to do administrative
124:17 - tasks right it's not fun to
124:19 - you know fill out stuff for the
124:20 - secretary of state it's not fun to do
124:22 - your bookkeeping it's not fun to do
124:24 - those kinds of things that's not why you
124:26 - signed up for free code camp that's not
124:28 - why you became a software developer in
124:30 - the first place but unfortunately those
124:32 - things are part of the job and if you
124:34 - don't pay attention to them
124:37 - failing to complete those administrative
124:38 - tasks timely and to handle them
124:40 - correctly
124:41 - will lead to problems with your actual
124:43 - substantive business okay so this is why
124:46 - i'm talking about the administrative
124:48 - tasks first
124:50 - so
124:50 - the first administrative issue i'm going
124:52 - to talk about
124:54 - in the management of your business is
124:56 - the biggest one and that's your
124:58 - day-to-day financial management
125:00 - i could do easily a very long video
125:03 - course on how to manage your freelance
125:06 - business from a financial standpoint
125:09 - and
125:10 - because it would be so long i'm not
125:11 - going to dive into all of it now what
125:13 - i'm going to do is suggest you read a
125:15 - book which i suggested earlier in this
125:17 - course and that book is called profit
125:19 - first what profit first does
125:22 - is it lays out a framework which can
125:25 - manage your businesses finances for you
125:27 - so in other words it puts a framework in
125:28 - place you follow the framework and your
125:32 - business's finances kind of manage
125:34 - themselves at that point
125:36 - and financial management is one of the
125:39 - biggest things where a lot of people get
125:41 - themselves into trouble one of the
125:43 - biggest things you want to avoid is
125:45 - what's called bank balance accounting
125:47 - and lots of small business owners are
125:49 - guilty of this where they go online they
125:51 - look at their bank account they see a
125:53 - balance you know on the screen and they
125:55 - just assume that's that's how much money
125:57 - they have without any thought of you
125:59 - know what they've got to be paying
126:00 - what's coming out of it and
126:02 - so on so forth following the
126:05 - methodology laid out in profit first can
126:08 - a help you avoid bank balance accounting
126:10 - but also just help you make sure that
126:12 - your business is staying on
126:15 - path
126:16 - and in addition to reading profit first
126:20 - just remember that your businesses bank
126:22 - account is not your personal bank
126:24 - account you just can't go rate it
126:25 - whenever you want some money what you
126:27 - want to do is set up a system where
126:30 - you're only allowed to take a certain
126:31 - amount of money out of the business at
126:33 - any given time and a certain amount of
126:35 - money has to stay in the business at a
126:37 - given time and the profit first book
126:39 - really does a good job of laying all
126:41 - that out for you so if you can avoid
126:43 - financial mismanagement you will avoid a
126:46 - lot of the problems that or i should say
126:49 - administrative problems that get
126:51 - freelance developers into trouble and
126:54 - what i would suggest to you as an easy
126:55 - to use method for making sure you
126:59 - are following good financial management
127:00 - habits
127:01 - for your business is to read profit
127:03 - first and follow it again it's not
127:05 - enough to read the book you actually
127:06 - have to follow
127:08 - the methodology it's laying out for you
127:12 - the second big part in addition to
127:15 - following a methodology like the one in
127:17 - profit first to making sure that your
127:19 - finances are managed properly is to do
127:22 - your accounting regularly this is so
127:24 - important i cannot stress it enough do
127:26 - your accounting regularly you should be
127:28 - using bookkeeping software like wave or
127:30 - quickbooks or something of the sort in
127:32 - our business we use wave
127:35 - and i see way way way way way too many
127:38 - small businesses that don't do their
127:41 - books until the end of the year or even
127:43 - worse at the end of the year
127:45 - they essentially just print off all
127:46 - their bank statements and dump it on an
127:48 - accountant and say okay here figure out
127:50 - how much money i made last year well
127:53 - not doing the books in your business on
127:55 - a regular basis
127:57 - means you never actually know
127:59 - if you're making money or not and if you
128:01 - are making money how much you're making
128:02 - and if you're losing money how much
128:04 - you're losing and then it becomes easy
128:06 - for you to think well it seems like i'm
128:07 - doing good
128:09 - well seem can be a very tricky thing and
128:11 - you can get yourself in a lot of trouble
128:13 - by going off of how things seem what you
128:16 - need is objective data in front of you
128:17 - in other words you need a monthly
128:19 - statement showing here's how much money
128:21 - my business took in here's how much went
128:23 - out here's how much i've made here's how
128:25 - much i lost you've got to do your books
128:28 - on a regular basis
128:29 - if you get up and
128:32 - the first thing every day before you
128:34 - start work just do your bookkeeping for
128:36 - the day before in other words download
128:38 - the prior days transactions and
128:40 - reconcile them in your accounting
128:42 - software then you get in the habit of
128:44 - doing that and your books are just done
128:46 - all the time and it doesn't take more
128:47 - than a few minutes a day when you're
128:49 - just starting out if you have very few
128:51 - transactions at a minimum do your books
128:53 - once a week or at worst once a month but
128:56 - do your books on a regular basis i
128:58 - cannot stress this enough that is the
129:00 - only way you're actually going to know
129:02 - how much money you're making or how much
129:03 - money you're losing and what you need to
129:06 - adjust another benefit of doing your
129:08 - books on a regular basis is it also
129:09 - helps you catch expenses you might not
129:11 - realize you've signed up for that you're
129:12 - still paying so
129:14 - do your books regularly so in terms of
129:16 - managing your finances
129:18 - read profit first
129:20 - follow the methods laid out in profit
129:23 - first
129:24 - avoid using your personal bank account
129:26 - or i'm sorry your business's bank
129:28 - account as a piggy bank you can't just
129:30 - rate it whenever you want
129:33 - and the fourth part of managing your
129:35 - finances is doing your books daily
129:37 - so that's keeping your finances in order
129:39 - which again is one of the biggest
129:40 - administrative problems that
129:43 - a lot of freelancers run into
129:45 - and in terms of the second aspect of
129:49 - your administrative problems or
129:51 - administrative tasks i should say that
129:53 - you've got to manage on a day-to-day
129:54 - basis
129:56 - that is just really all the different
129:58 - things that come with being a small
129:59 - business person too having to file your
130:02 - business license every year if you're in
130:03 - a state that requires that two having to
130:06 - file any documentation you need to file
130:09 - with
130:10 - county sales tax boards let's say you'll
130:12 - find that as an entrepreneur there is an
130:16 - endless flow of paperwork that you need
130:18 - to fill out and you need to stay on top
130:20 - of it so the best thing to do is don't
130:24 - take the approach of i'll do this later
130:27 - when a piece of paper comes across your
130:28 - desk and you look at it and you say oh
130:31 - okay i have to file something with the
130:33 - secretary of state just deal with it on
130:36 - the spot don't let these things pile up
130:39 - okay letting these kinds of tasks pile
130:41 - up is another of the big mistakes i see
130:44 - from entrepreneurs and again they might
130:47 - find out they've lost the ability to do
130:48 - business legally because they've let
130:50 - these things pile up if you just deal
130:52 - with them as soon as they come up
130:54 - then they're done you don't have to
130:56 - worry about them they're
130:57 - just taken care of and they probably
130:59 - don't even take that long
131:00 - what takes a long time is when you let
131:02 - these things grow into a stack this high
131:04 - and then you have to stop everything
131:05 - you're doing and spend days if not weeks
131:07 - dealing with all that stuff so deal with
131:09 - your administrative tasks as they come
131:12 - up just treat them as a priority that
131:13 - has to be dealt with
131:15 - because by getting them out of the way
131:17 - you can focus on the substantive work
131:19 - more okay so deal with those things
131:22 - immediately after they arise that is
131:25 - just something it is so important
131:27 - and if you do that you will have an
131:29 - advantage over other freelancers so in
131:32 - short if you want to get a leg up
131:35 - in your new business you got you have to
131:37 - take your administrative test seriously
131:40 - you have to manage your finances
131:41 - appropriately which cut which entails
131:43 - everything we just talked about reading
131:45 - profit first following the methods in it
131:48 - not rating your bank account doing your
131:50 - books on a regular basis and you have to
131:52 - deal with your administrative tasks as
131:54 - soon as they come up and if you need
131:56 - help with them
131:57 - retain a business lawyer to help you
131:59 - okay but if you do those things you
132:02 - prevent your administrative tasks from
132:04 - getting in the way of your actual
132:06 - business and then you make more money
132:08 - so with all that said let's get on to
132:10 - our accounting and financial management
132:12 - course from aaron lear of kpi
132:14 - bookkeeping
132:16 - hey code campers my name is aaron lair
132:18 - i'm the owner of kpi bookkeeping and
132:20 - consulting and i'm excited to go over
132:22 - with you today how to manage your
132:23 - finances as a freelancer i know this
132:26 - isn't everyone's most exciting or
132:28 - favorite topic but it is so important if
132:30 - you can get off on the right step and
132:32 - create good habits you'll be so much
132:34 - more ahead of other freelancers as well
132:36 - as business owners because you will know
132:38 - your income your expenses you'll know
132:40 - how to manage them and you'll know what
132:42 - decisions to make and what changes to
132:45 - make within your freelancing business so
132:48 - i'm going to divide this up into three
132:50 - topics uh this first one's just going to
132:51 - be the real basics 101 second topic
132:54 - we're going to do a brief overview of
132:56 - your chart of accounts or your income
132:58 - and expense buckets and once you get
133:00 - inside your accounting software and then
133:03 - the third topic we're going to cover a
133:04 - profit and loss statement just kind of
133:06 - how to read it and what it looks like
133:08 - all right i hope you find this helpful
133:10 - and best of luck thanks
133:17 - okay so if there are just three things
133:20 - to do if you don't want to watch
133:21 - anything else past this just three
133:23 - things
133:24 - is number one keep your business and
133:27 - personal finances separate number two
133:30 - save at least 25 30 of your gross income
133:33 - and number three have an accounting
133:35 - software and actually use it
133:38 - so let's get back to number one um
133:41 - keeping your business finances separate
133:43 - um from your personal
133:45 - so this one is
133:47 - just if there's one thing you do just at
133:49 - least do this one this is huge it'll
133:51 - save you so much time so much of a
133:53 - headache and money when it comes to
133:55 - getting your taxes done
133:57 - and it's as simple as when you're ready
133:59 - to start freelancing go open your own
134:01 - business bank account checking business
134:04 - checking account and savings account
134:07 - and any
134:08 - business transactions you occur those
134:10 - all need to come out of that business
134:12 - account as well as if you need to get a
134:13 - credit card open a credit card just for
134:16 - your business expenses
134:17 - and then keep all of your personal
134:19 - expenses separate just like the way
134:20 - you've had them running through your own
134:22 - personal accounts
134:24 - this will be huge when it comes to tax
134:26 - time and you'll be able to separate the
134:28 - differences between your freelancing and
134:31 - business activities versus your personal
134:33 - activities
134:35 - number two
134:37 - save 25 to 30 percent of your gross
134:39 - income for taxes
134:41 - i know that sounds like a lot i know it
134:43 - sounds crazy but it's definitely
134:46 - something you need to do
134:48 - and i also think you really need to
134:49 - factor this in when you start to
134:53 - give quotes and create your pricing
134:55 - structures
134:57 - the government wants right off the bat
135:00 - 15.3 percent for self-employment tax now
135:03 - that other 10 to 15 percent is just on
135:06 - the other income you receive
135:09 - so
135:10 - this is why you want to set up that
135:12 - savings account so as you get your
135:13 - business income coming into your
135:15 - business checking account i would say
135:17 - immediately or at least once a week take
135:19 - that income take that percentage of 25
135:22 - to 30 percent and then dump that right
135:24 - into your savings account so you're into
135:27 - your business savings account so that is
135:30 - stored away tucked away for taxes
135:33 - and then when tax time comes there's no
135:35 - big surprises you've got the money
135:38 - you're good to go
135:39 - um so that is huge i think this one
135:42 - surprises a lot of people a lot of
135:43 - freelancers they don't realize how high
135:45 - self-employment taxes and how much taxes
135:48 - will be taken out so do keep that in
135:50 - mind when you go to price when you
135:52 - create pricing structures
135:54 - and then number three have a accounting
135:56 - software and actually use it so i get a
135:59 - lot of clients that have accounting
136:00 - softwares they have things maybe synced
136:02 - up but they're not necessarily using it
136:05 - and i understand you get busy and if you
136:07 - can't use it or you don't know how then
136:09 - then reach out and get some help with it
136:11 - but when you go to select an accounting
136:14 - software
136:15 - i would get three major things one it
136:18 - can connect to your bank accounts and
136:19 - credit cards so these are typically
136:21 - gonna all be your cloud-based accounting
136:23 - um accounting software programs number
136:25 - two you can send your invoices from that
136:28 - platform or software whichever you
136:30 - choose
136:31 - and it has a pay now feature this will
136:33 - save you so much time and hassle as far
136:35 - as tracking your your invoices and then
136:38 - number two is you can pull a profitable
136:40 - loss report at minimum and profit law
136:42 - support ideally you'd like to be able to
136:44 - pull a balance sheet and a cash flow
136:46 - statement but you at least want to be
136:47 - able to pull a profit and loss report
136:50 - okay so let's move on to
136:53 - some accounting softwares
136:55 - um
136:55 - these are just a list of probably my top
136:57 - four
136:59 - the first two wave and freshbooks these
137:02 - are great for if you're just starting
137:03 - out they're
137:04 - very user friendly they've got a great
137:06 - interface on them um
137:09 - they're for the most part pretty
137:10 - intuitive i'm going to go over a little
137:12 - bit of things you need to to keep your
137:14 - eye on on the next video but these are
137:16 - great to just get started
137:19 - that you can invoice from them
137:21 - you can receive payments it'll track you
137:23 - can connect all your bank accounts and
137:26 - credit cards so these are great starters
137:29 - now if you
137:31 - you know let's say you want something
137:32 - you just want to stick with one and you
137:34 - want something that can grow with you
137:36 - those next two would be quickbooks
137:37 - online and xero
137:40 - these are great for more full-on
137:41 - businesses i mean you can still use them
137:44 - as a freelancer
137:45 - um these are more robust there's a lot
137:48 - more kind of going behind the scenes and
137:50 - i would say if you're just starting out
137:52 - they might have a little more too many
137:53 - more bells and whistles than you might
137:55 - need but that doesn't mean you can't use
137:57 - them you can still certainly use them
137:58 - you might want to get some training on
138:00 - those and even if you feel like you need
138:01 - to get training on the other two wave
138:03 - and fresh books i would definitely
138:05 - reach out and look for those
138:08 - but going back to quickbooks and xero
138:10 - these are great but again these will
138:12 - grow with you so you might not need
138:14 - these starting out you can certainly
138:15 - start in them but they're
138:17 - they will grow once you start having
138:19 - employees and you've got a lot more
138:21 - going on within your
138:22 - finances so this is just a brief
138:25 - overview um the next step or the next
138:27 - video we're going to get into is i'm
138:28 - going to kind of get into
138:30 - once you're in your accounting software
138:32 - what you really need to do and what you
138:34 - need to watch out for all right
138:36 - thanks
138:38 - let's move into your accounting software
138:40 - so you know how to get paid faster you
138:42 - know how to manage your receipts
138:44 - let's move into that accounting software
138:46 - and kind of get an idea of what we're
138:48 - looking at and what we're dealing with
138:50 - so just a warning this is a brief
138:53 - overview this is not going i'm not
138:55 - getting into any particular software so
138:59 - i do want to advise you that if you have
139:01 - questions
139:02 - reach out get help or get training from
139:05 - someone or take a course if you feel
139:07 - like you need to kind of get a better
139:09 - grip on this because if you start this
139:11 - out right it'll be much easier for you
139:13 - in the long run okay let's get started
139:16 - so
139:17 - what we're looking at right here is
139:19 - what's called a chart of accounts i'm
139:21 - going to just refer to these as income
139:22 - and expense buckets
139:24 - but these are chart of accounts
139:27 - a lot of these are going to be
139:28 - pre-loaded in your accounting software
139:32 - i will attach a pdf of this into
139:36 - this program but i want you to take a
139:39 - good look at the types so
139:42 - we've got income you can call this
139:45 - income or client
139:47 - sales or services that's going to be a
139:49 - revenue type any kind of expenses such
139:52 - as insurance or office supplies or rent
139:55 - those are all going to be expenses
139:58 - so as i said these will be already
140:01 - most of these a lot of some of them will
140:03 - be loaded in your accounting software
140:05 - you can change the names of them you can
140:08 - add more to them but as you start to do
140:12 - that
140:12 - use this as a guide as to what kind of
140:16 - type what
140:18 - one put a name on it whatever name you
140:20 - want and then you're going to use the
140:21 - type of account it's going to be
140:24 - and you can put it you can put a
140:25 - description in it's not a have to but
140:27 - this is very important because this type
140:29 - is going to tie to all your reports
140:32 - so depending on the type that will tie
140:34 - to your whether it falls on the p l the
140:37 - profit and loss report the balance sheet
140:41 - or the cash flow statement most of the
140:42 - time they're either going to just fall
140:44 - on the profit and loss or the balance
140:45 - sheet
140:47 - um so
140:49 - these are general expenses this is
140:51 - revenue
140:52 - um
140:53 - let's go to this next page okay so right
140:56 - here on owner's contribution or owner's
140:59 - pay
141:01 - this is labeled as equity this type is
141:03 - called equity and the reason for that is
141:05 - because this is not an income event so
141:08 - if you were to add money which would be
141:10 - owner's contribution add money into your
141:12 - business account
141:14 - that would be considered you're adding
141:16 - equity into your account if you were to
141:18 - take money out
141:20 - or to pay for any kind of personal
141:22 - expenses from your business account i
141:24 - don't recommend doing that on a daily
141:26 - basis or on a regular basis but if you
141:29 - made a slip up and you accidentally had
141:32 - an amazon account that got charged to
141:34 - your business account but it was a
141:36 - personal
141:38 - amazon purchase you could take that
141:40 - amount and code it to personal expenses
141:43 - or owner's pay
141:45 - um
141:46 - and those would not be that would not be
141:48 - considered an expense because you're
141:50 - it's the equity out of out of the money
141:53 - out of your business account
141:56 - these others right here some of these
141:58 - are kind of accounts that are working in
142:00 - the background so as you put in an
142:02 - invoice
142:04 - that accounting software is
142:05 - automatically going to code that invoice
142:07 - under the type accounts receivable
142:10 - because you're waiting for that money to
142:11 - come in you're waiting for it to be
142:13 - received to you
142:15 - accounts payable any kind of bills you
142:17 - owe if you go in and put a bill in but
142:19 - you haven't paid it yet and this isn't a
142:22 - necessary way of doing this you can
142:23 - certainly do it that way
142:25 - it definitely helps with your cash flow
142:27 - but if you're just paying your expenses
142:30 - as they come that's fine too but if you
142:32 - do decide to put your bills in
142:34 - and then pay later that would be an
142:36 - accounts payable
142:38 - and that will be labeled as accounts
142:40 - payable and that kind of automatically
142:41 - happens in the background of your
142:43 - accounting system
142:45 - um if you have any loans that's going to
142:47 - be a liability
142:49 - any taxes now taxes can be
142:51 - both a liability or an expense that's
142:54 - something you probably need to talk to
142:55 - your accountant to as far as how you're
142:57 - managing your filing and when you're
142:59 - filing your taxes that makes a big
143:01 - difference any large pieces of equipment
143:04 - are going to be considered assets
143:08 - and then retained earnings so retained
143:10 - earnings is any money that you
143:13 - made from the previous year so let's say
143:14 - at the end of your p l
143:16 - you had a positive of ten thousand
143:18 - dollars
143:19 - on december 31st of 2018 so come january
143:23 - 1st of 2019 that 10 000 is now going to
143:26 - move into retained earnings and now that
143:29 - p l will essentially start at zero
143:34 - so again use this as a guide um i will
143:37 - have a pdf of this and when you get into
143:39 - your
143:40 - your accounting software you're going to
143:42 - want to create these buckets or name
143:45 - them and like i said a lot of them will
143:46 - already be present
143:48 - um
143:50 - but use this as a guide to make sure
143:51 - you've got the right type so then your
143:53 - reports
143:55 - are correct as well
143:56 - okay um i have a weekly checklist a
143:59 - monthly checklist
144:01 - and a quarterly checklist so weekly you
144:03 - want to review your outstanding invoices
144:05 - and make any follow-up calls as needed
144:08 - you want to make sure you're organizing
144:09 - your receipts sort your bank
144:10 - transactions in your within your
144:12 - accounting software that's
144:14 - taking all those
144:17 - income and expenses and sorting them
144:18 - into those buckets we just talked about
144:21 - pay any bills and don't forget to pay
144:23 - yourself
144:24 - you can pay yourself monthly if you want
144:26 - to do it that way weekly if you have a
144:28 - good client flow it's not bad to pay
144:30 - yourself weekly because it kind of just
144:32 - helps you stay on track and helps you
144:33 - know your cash flow a little better
144:36 - monthly you want to reconcile your bank
144:38 - and credit cards this is so important i
144:41 - could create a whole other video on this
144:43 - i'm not going to
144:44 - but i suggest you really look into doing
144:46 - this is reconciling those banking credit
144:48 - card accounts against your bank
144:50 - statements and your credit card
144:51 - statements is like a big double check of
144:53 - what's going on within your accounting
144:55 - programs
144:56 - um review your profit and loss review
144:59 - your income i'm sorry review your
145:01 - expenses and subscriptions
145:04 - sub
145:05 - subscription creep is real i've seen it
145:08 - a lot so make sure you stay on top of
145:10 - those subscriptions and
145:12 - you know what you're using and ditch any
145:14 - of the ones you are not using
145:16 - and then after you review all that get a
145:18 - good idea of your cash flow once you
145:20 - kind of get a good grip of your expenses
145:22 - you'll really start to know what your
145:24 - cash flow situation will be like as well
145:26 - as staying on top of those invoices any
145:29 - overpaid invoices
145:31 - so quarterly you want to make sure you
145:33 - pay your quarterly taxes you want to
145:36 - review those pricing structures
145:39 - and then
145:40 - another one that i have not mentioned
145:42 - that's pretty important is
145:44 - make sure all your clients have a w-9
145:46 - from you so any client that you pay or
145:50 - i'm sorry that you invoice over six
145:51 - hundred dollars they should be
145:53 - requesting a double knight excuse me a
145:56 - w-9 from you
145:58 - um
145:59 - if they do not be prepared they may be
146:01 - requesting it around mid to in january
146:04 - that's when we have to file those w9 so
146:06 - keep that in mind if
146:08 - on my next point if you
146:11 - ask for any help or you get any 1099
146:13 - contractors to help you out you need to
146:15 - ask them for a w-9 and it's just a
146:18 - one-sheet
146:19 - irs document
146:21 - that basically just says you're an
146:23 - independent contractor
146:25 - um you can look it up google w9 and it's
146:27 - one of the first two or three things to
146:29 - pop up in google um
146:31 - you need that as well and you as if you
146:35 - hire any 1099 contractors you need to
146:38 - make sure you file those typically it's
146:40 - the last week of january i'm not going
146:42 - to be a specific date because the dates
146:43 - change every year
146:45 - around the last five days of january
146:48 - those need to be filed they're very easy
146:49 - to file it's 1099 filings is what
146:52 - they're called um
146:54 - so be prepared you're going to get asked
146:56 - that from your clients and if you happen
146:58 - to need to get any help with coding or
147:01 - design work for a client that you're
147:03 - working on you you need to make sure
147:05 - they hand you a w-9 as well
147:08 - all right that should wrap up your
147:10 - checklist let's dive into the p l
147:13 - all right you've made it we're not at
147:15 - our last video
147:16 - um so i'm going to talk about the profit
147:18 - and loss on this one and hopefully this
147:20 - will kind of wrap up everything and help
147:22 - you understand why it's important to do
147:25 - good financials and really pay attention
147:28 - to those income and expense buckets okay
147:30 - so let's get started
147:33 - okay so as you'll see on the left there
147:35 - is a profit and loss example of a profit
147:37 - loss statement
147:38 - i have blocked out the names any dates
147:40 - anything that could possibly reveal
147:41 - whose profit and loss this is
147:45 - so let me just start off with saying why
147:47 - you want to run a profit and loss
147:50 - i think we all want to do what we love
147:53 - doing and i'm assuming you love being
147:55 - coders but i also think we all need to
147:57 - know how much money we're making
147:59 - and a profit and loss is going to tell
148:01 - you that it's going to take your income
148:03 - minus all your expenses and then tell
148:05 - you what is left over
148:07 - and the more you focus on this
148:10 - the more you're going to be able to
148:11 - realize
148:12 - what changes you need to make maybe what
148:14 - kind of pivots you need to make with
148:16 - pricing maybe where you can cut back on
148:18 - expenses where you could actually add
148:20 - more in expenses so
148:23 - a profit loss is very important in terms
148:25 - of giving you a snapshot of where you
148:28 - are and you can pull a profit and loss
148:29 - on a weekly basis on a monthly basis
148:31 - quarterly yearly
148:33 - it'll just tell you exactly how much
148:35 - money you've brought in and how much
148:36 - you've brought out
148:37 - this will help with cash flow i'm not
148:39 - going to tell you this is the best
148:41 - report i'm going to tell you that a cash
148:42 - flow statement is a best report for cash
148:44 - flow but for just getting started this
148:47 - will give you an idea at least on your
148:49 - expenses what you could expect each
148:51 - month or even each week
148:54 - so this is why it's important to have an
148:56 - accounting software that will provide a
148:58 - profit and loss statement for you
149:00 - i also suggest in terms of getting
149:02 - overall health of your business and
149:04 - trying to make business decisions just
149:06 - is pulling a balance sheet and a cash
149:09 - flow statement and if you don't
149:10 - understand those to have someone help
149:12 - you understand those and make uh
149:15 - decisions moving forward
149:17 - anyway that's my soapbox let's get
149:19 - started on the profit and loss so profit
149:21 - loss you're going to have top line is
149:23 - going to be on your income you might
149:25 - have different income
149:27 - types client services client design work
149:30 - client code work however you want to do
149:32 - that but
149:34 - that is going to go back to those
149:36 - revenue buckets so that's why back in
149:38 - the other video when i talked about the
149:39 - buckets that's what's forming this p l
149:42 - in the background okay
149:44 - so you're gonna see revenue
149:46 - slash income and expenses so that's why
149:49 - that's important to make sure those
149:50 - types
149:51 - back on the previous video are correct
149:54 - so all of that information lands on the
149:56 - right report
149:57 - okay so you've got your income
150:00 - cost of goods and i'll get to this in
150:02 - just a minute and then your general
150:03 - business expenses so cost of goods is
150:06 - going to be
150:08 - if you have any kind of product that you
150:10 - have to purchase and then you
150:13 - sell that product to your client that is
150:15 - going to be your cost of goods sold i
150:18 - don't think most of you will incur any
150:20 - of this if you're just doing
150:21 - service-based business you're producing
150:24 - websites and
150:25 - codes and apps and things like that you
150:28 - really shouldn't have any cost of goods
150:30 - but that's just what that is here for
150:32 - um
150:34 - so you'll have top line income cost of
150:36 - goods and now you have a gross profit
150:38 - and then from that gross profit these
150:40 - are going to be your general expenses
150:42 - your rent your phone your internet your
150:45 - insurance anything that you incur on a
150:47 - regular basis or any kind of business
150:49 - doesn't have to be regular basis any
150:50 - kind of business expense
150:52 - and then that at the bottom that will
150:54 - give you your net operating income so
150:55 - this is going to tell you this 8 000
150:59 - and 99.38 is going to tell you how much
151:02 - money you brought in in that given time
151:04 - period whatever given time period you
151:06 - selected
151:08 - okay so
151:10 - profit and loss statement should only
151:12 - have your business related expenses
151:14 - income and expenses
151:15 - um
151:18 - in terms of what it should not have i'm
151:20 - going to jump back to that interest
151:21 - expense in just a minute but i'll go
151:23 - ahead and i'm going to go ahead and jump
151:25 - to the loan payment first so if you have
151:28 - a loan
151:30 - a loan payment is a little interesting
151:31 - in the fact that you have to have you
151:33 - kind of have to split that payment and
151:35 - you put the principal amount to a
151:36 - liability account and the interest
151:39 - amount can be on an expense account and
151:41 - you can see that loan interest amount on
151:43 - the profit and loss but the principal
151:45 - amount
151:47 - is on the balance sheet
151:49 - i know that's a little confusing if you
151:51 - have any loans i would suggest getting
151:53 - help setting that up once you get it set
151:55 - up it's not that hard to manage but
151:56 - that's just something that i see a lot
151:58 - of mistakes made so bottom line is don't
152:00 - put the entire loan amount on the profit
152:02 - and loss statement it is not an expense
152:06 - it's kind of a mix of an expense and a
152:07 - liability i'll leave it at that for now
152:10 - i don't want to get too far in the weeds
152:11 - with that um
152:13 - profit laws should not have your owner's
152:15 - pay so again this goes back to that
152:16 - previous video about how the owners pay
152:19 - is equity anything equity related will
152:21 - be on a balance sheet so if you want to
152:23 - pull up your running owner's payout or
152:26 - running owner's contribution you will
152:28 - find that on your balance sheet as long
152:30 - as it's coded to equity
152:32 - mileage is not on a p l i get that
152:34 - question asked quite a bit
152:36 - you can't really put that on a profit
152:38 - and loss you can track it i would
152:40 - suggest using mile iq but you cannot
152:42 - really put it on them on a profit loss
152:44 - so if you have mileage if you are
152:46 - running from client to client track that
152:49 - mileage and turn that into your tax
152:50 - accountant
152:52 - and then bottom line is any expenses
152:55 - that you do not feel confident in
152:57 - justifying to the irs should not be on
152:59 - your profit and loss
153:01 - period so
153:04 - if you
153:05 - i get a lot of clients that try to want
153:07 - to put
153:08 - their kids soccer club
153:10 - in their business they want to expense
153:12 - that out because they want to call it
153:13 - networking or they want to put their
153:14 - botox so they want to put every amazon
153:16 - charge they've ever had to their profit
153:19 - and loss and label it as office expenses
153:23 - i'm never going to tell clients what to
153:25 - do but i will tell you this is
153:28 - you always
153:29 - want to feel confident and if you were
153:31 - to ever to face an audit which i ever
153:33 - hope you do not have to do but if you
153:34 - ever have to face an audit that you can
153:36 - comfortably and confidently say that it
153:38 - was a business expense here's my receipt
153:41 - and here's my invoice so just keep that
153:43 - in the back your mind
153:45 - if you ever in question on i don't know
153:47 - if it's a businessman's i don't know if
153:49 - it's personal i don't know how to code
153:50 - this just keep that in the back of your
153:51 - mind
153:53 - and then
153:55 - one other item
153:56 - that
153:57 - depending on how you have your books set
153:59 - up is any kind of what they call bad
154:02 - debt so if you have any lingering
154:03 - invoices let's say they're six months
154:06 - old or old or
154:07 - a year or even more that you have not
154:10 - gotten paid on you know you're not going
154:12 - to get payment on i would bring that up
154:14 - to your tax accountant when you go to do
154:16 - taxes that may affect your taxes
154:19 - a little bit for the better it may not
154:21 - it really depends on how you have your
154:22 - book set up so i didn't really want to
154:24 - list that on there because it could be
154:26 - different for everyone's situation in
154:27 - terms of how their accounting
154:30 - is set up that really gets into accrual
154:32 - basis versus cash basis i don't want to
154:34 - get too far into that because
154:36 - everybody's going to be different but
154:37 - just keep that in mind keep track of
154:39 - those
154:41 - and just if you do have any lingering
154:43 - invoices bring that up to your attacks
154:44 - account and just let them know and see
154:46 - if they have any suggestions
154:49 - all right well i really hope this helped
154:51 - you all um
154:52 - please reach out if you have questions
154:55 - get training if you're not sure on what
154:57 - you're doing i know it's a lot but if
154:59 - you just start off on the right foot and
155:02 - you start these good habits
155:04 - it'll make your life so much easier and
155:06 - you will save money in the long run and
155:08 - you'll be that much more ahead of the
155:10 - game because you're going to know where
155:11 - you stand financially what decisions you
155:13 - can make how you can start to price
155:16 - where you can cut back and how you can

155:25 - little bit of research

155:40 - okay a big thanks to aaron now let's
155:42 - talk about how to manage your dev work
155:44 - on a day-to-day basis
155:52 - okay so it's time to start talking about
155:54 - how you're going to manage your
155:55 - substantive work on a day-to-day basis
155:57 - and by substantive work i mean the
155:59 - actual dev work which is the whole
156:01 - reason you started free code camp and
156:03 - got into being a developer in the first
156:05 - place
156:06 - and managing your deb work appropriately
156:09 - daily will allow you to maximize your
156:11 - profits
156:12 - and proper management of your day-to-day
156:14 - activities really focuses on two things
156:16 - first is the fact that you have to put
156:19 - in the time in other words you know you
156:21 - have to put the time into your business
156:22 - you have to go to work
156:24 - you would be surprised at how many
156:26 - entrepreneurs don't even put in a
156:28 - 40-hour work week and the second thing
156:30 - is you have to make sure you're working
156:32 - efficiently
156:34 - and why do i say that both of these are
156:36 - important putting in the time and
156:38 - working efficiently
156:40 - think of it like this
156:41 - suppose
156:42 - you go to work and i go to work and
156:45 - you're 25 more efficient than i am
156:49 - and you work 30 hours a week and i work
156:51 - 40 hours a week
156:52 - well if you're 25 more efficient than me
156:55 - then in 30 hours a week you will
156:57 - accomplish
156:58 - what takes me 37 and a half hours
157:01 - but because i went to work for 40 hours
157:02 - in a week i'm going to accomplish more
157:04 - than you and because i'm going to
157:05 - accomplish more than you i'm going to
157:06 - make more money
157:08 - so
157:09 - with that being said
157:11 - if you and i both go to work for 40
157:13 - hours and you're 25 percent more import
157:16 - or efficient than i am
157:18 - then in 40 hours you will accomplish
157:21 - what takes me 50 hours so this is why if
157:24 - you can work efficiently and put in the
157:26 - time
157:27 - you will make an astronomical amount of
157:30 - profits compared to what you would make
157:32 - otherwise
157:33 - now i think it's important to stress
157:35 - these things because
157:37 - you would be surprised at how many
157:39 - people don't put in 40 hours a week into
157:41 - their business
157:42 - so
157:43 - just as an example if you're going to
157:44 - work and you're not uh you know keeping
157:47 - track of your time which a lot of
157:48 - self-employed people don't it can be
157:49 - easy to feel like oh man i worked a lot
157:51 - today when again at the end of the day
157:53 - you're really not putting in as much
157:54 - time as you thought you did right
157:56 - so
157:57 - making sure you're putting in the time
157:59 - and tracking the time is
158:01 - rule number one so let's start by
158:03 - looking at that and then let's look at
158:05 - what you need to do in terms of making
158:08 - sure you're working efficiently and
158:10 - we'll give some tips for improved
158:11 - efficiency
158:22 - okay so the first part of being
158:23 - successful on a day-to-day basis is
158:25 - putting in the time when it comes to
158:26 - your business and putting in the time
158:28 - means that you've got a certain number
158:30 - of hours that you're going to work and
158:32 - that is just going to be a minimum that
158:33 - you're going to work every week there
158:34 - may be some weeks where you have to work
158:36 - more right because you may have a
158:37 - deadline you have to meet
158:39 - a project may be taking longer than
158:40 - expected and you have to work over to
158:42 - meet that deadline or something of that
158:44 - nature but the crucial part is to pick a
158:46 - number of hours you are going to work
158:48 - every week and make sure you put in
158:50 - those hours so in other words let's say
158:54 - you're
158:55 - you're going to work 40 hours a week at
158:57 - your business you get all your
159:00 - development work done in let's just say
159:02 - 30 hours then that means you've got 10
159:05 - hours left that you need to be devoting
159:06 - to marketing your business you know
159:08 - that's you use that extra 10 hours to
159:09 - write blog posts make youtube videos uh
159:11 - go to networking events
159:13 - things of that nature so
159:15 - again
159:16 - set a number of hours that you're going
159:18 - to work every week and make sure you are
159:20 - putting in those hours and there is
159:22 - always something for you to be doing so
159:25 - there's are what there are ways for you
159:26 - to make sure you meet those hours me
159:29 - personally in my business i'm i put in a
159:31 - minimum of 43.3 hours every week
159:34 - and when i tell people that number
159:36 - sometimes i get weird looks because 43.3
159:39 - is obviously not a round number
159:41 - where i came up with that is the fact
159:43 - that by working an extra 3.3 hours per
159:46 - week
159:47 - i wind up accomplishing in 12 months
159:50 - what would take someone working 40 hours
159:52 - a week
159:53 - 13 months
159:55 - in other words 3.3 hours more a week
159:57 - adds one more working month to my year
160:00 - and i find that combining that with
160:02 - trying to work efficiently really
160:04 - increases the amount i produce over a
160:06 - year over the course of a year i should
160:08 - say and as a result
160:09 - my income goes up so pick a number that
160:12 - you're going to put into your business
160:14 - and make sure you stick with it again if
160:16 - you don't have work to if you don't have
160:18 - development work to do put that extra
160:20 - time
160:21 - into marketing your business
160:24 - now
160:25 - it's really important that you do this
160:27 - in a way so that you avoid burnout let's
160:30 - say you decide you're going to work 45
160:32 - hours
160:33 - in a week
160:35 - you know on average okay and then let's
160:37 - say you have a week where you work 47
160:40 - well that means you can go ahead and
160:42 - take off two hours in another week and
160:44 - still be averaging 45 so in other words
160:47 - when i say i work 43.3 hours a week over
160:50 - the course of a year i make sure i
160:52 - average 43.3 some weeks i might work
160:54 - more some weeks i might work less if
160:56 - deadlines make me work more one week the
160:58 - next week i might take some time off or
161:00 - things of that sort so pick a number and
161:04 - stick with it and
161:06 - make sure that you put the time into
161:08 - something trust me there will always be
161:10 - something you can be doing
161:13 - in your business
161:15 - i cannot begin to tell you how many
161:17 - entrepreneurs i see who
161:19 - don't don't
161:21 - essentially know how much they work in a
161:22 - week like if you were to ask them how
161:24 - many hours do you require that you work
161:26 - in a week
161:27 - they don't have a number which i can
161:29 - understand someone saying they don't
161:30 - know how many hours they work in a week
161:32 - as a required number
161:34 - but then they also don't have for
161:35 - example set times of when they start
161:37 - work in the morning they don't have set
161:39 - times of when they go home they don't
161:42 - have set vacation schedules or
161:44 - requirements or anything like that so
161:46 - think of it like this
161:48 - those entrepreneurs
161:50 - don't get to work at any particular time
161:51 - just they just get to work whenever they
161:53 - feel like it
161:54 - they leave whenever they feel like it
161:57 - at the end of the week they're not
161:58 - making sure they've worked a certain
162:00 - number of hours
162:02 - and they just take vacation time
162:03 - whenever they want
162:04 - and people wonder why so many small
162:06 - businesses fail well one of the reasons
162:08 - why so many small businesses fail is
162:10 - just to be frank people who start up
162:11 - their own business don't put in the time
162:14 - so
162:15 - pick a number of hours
162:16 - stick with it
162:18 - and then make sure you're meeting those
162:20 - requirements and if you do that
162:22 - this may sound really simple
162:24 - but you will be ahead of a lot of your
162:27 - competition because your competition is
162:29 - just not going to put in the time it's
162:31 - just not going to happen
162:33 - put in the time for your business and
162:35 - you increase your chances of success
162:38 - just exponentially i can't stress that
162:40 - enough if you fail there's pretty good
162:42 - chances because you weren't putting in
162:44 - the time so again
162:47 - if you're going to make a full-time if
162:48 - you've decided to make
162:50 - your new development business a
162:52 - full-time job
162:53 - my suggestion is actually put your hour
162:56 - requirement a little bit over 40 hours
162:57 - because 40 hours is considered a normal
162:59 - work week right so
163:01 - challenge yourself a little bit do a
163:03 - little bit more again i get an extra
163:05 - month a year only by doing an extra 3.3
163:07 - hours a week if you say 3.3 hours a week
163:09 - sounds like a lot ask yourself how much
163:11 - time do you spend looking at facebook
163:12 - how much time you spend you know
163:14 - watching television i mean how much time
163:16 - do you spend you know engaging in other
163:18 - you know like idle activities just cut
163:20 - out a few of those things and make sure
163:21 - you're putting the time into
163:23 - growing your business and then if when
163:25 - you combine those hours with
163:27 - high efficiency you'll produce so much
163:29 - that so many people are going to look at
163:30 - you and go how did that person produce
163:32 - all that they just won't understand it
163:34 - and they and you will understand it was
163:36 - a
163:36 - function of the time you put in plus the
163:38 - efficiency so pick a number of hours and
163:42 - stick with it and hold yourself to it
163:44 - show some discipline you know get your
163:46 - work ethic in and put put in that work
163:48 - ethic and you will succeed
163:50 - so
163:51 - with all that being said now let's take
163:53 - a dive into how you can actually make
163:55 - sure that those hours are going to be
163:56 - working are going to be spent doing
163:58 - something efficient
164:10 - okay in our last segment we talked about
164:12 - the need to put in the hours when it
164:13 - comes to your freelance business but now
164:15 - let's talk about how you can be
164:16 - productive when you're putting in those
164:18 - hours
164:19 - it's i'm going to talk about this
164:20 - because it's really important to
164:21 - remember that putting in time
164:24 - it does not necessarily equal getting
164:26 - stuff done
164:28 - um i've seen plenty of situations where
164:30 - someone might actually spend literally
164:32 - 14 15 16 hours a day at work
164:35 - and leave the day leave at the end of
164:37 - the day accomplishing virtually nothing
164:40 - i actually know of entrepreneurs who and
164:42 - i feel bad for them literally work 16
164:45 - hours a day probably six to seven days a
164:48 - week and are just so inefficient in
164:50 - terms of how they go about their day
164:52 - that they accomplish probably what an
164:55 - efficient person would accomplish in a
164:57 - 30 hour work week so if you take putting
165:00 - in the time and combine it with
165:01 - efficiency that's how you become
165:03 - productive and that's how you make more
165:05 - money so the thing i can't stress to you
165:07 - enough again is you got to put in the
165:09 - time but don't think simply because
165:10 - you're putting in the time
165:12 - that you're being productive you have to
165:14 - put in the time but you also have to be
165:16 - efficient in your use of that time in
165:18 - other words you need to produce a lot
165:20 - per hour so think of it like this
165:24 - let's say you put in a lot of time let's
165:26 - say you put in 50 hours a week
165:30 - and now let's say you're
165:32 - twice as productive as
165:34 - somebody else
165:36 - that means in other words that you get
165:38 - twice done in an hour what someone else
165:39 - gets done in an hour which there are
165:41 - people that inefficient so there will be
165:43 - people that you're doubling their
165:44 - productivity
165:46 - if you put in 50 hours you're twice as
165:48 - productive as somebody else
165:50 - they have to go to work for 100 hours to
165:53 - you know accomplish uh you know what you
165:55 - did in 50 and if they're only working a
165:58 - 40 hour work week it takes them two and
166:00 - a half weeks to accomplish what you
166:01 - accomplish in one work week and that's
166:03 - how you make a lot more money you know
166:05 - as a freelancer as a self-employed
166:08 - developer so again
166:12 - just simply going to work
166:13 - does not mean you're getting stuff done
166:15 - you have to be efficient in your use of
166:16 - time
166:17 - so let's look at a few pointers and
166:19 - again these are just a few this is by no
166:21 - means an exhaustive list let's look at a
166:23 - few examples in terms of how you can be
166:25 - more efficient with the use of your time
166:28 - number one is what i call the ohio
166:30 - method ohio stands for only handle at
166:34 - once i'll talk about what this means in
166:35 - a minute
166:36 - number two focus on completing one thing
166:39 - at a time don't always have nine
166:41 - different projects that you're trying to
166:42 - complete simultaneously
166:45 - number three when problems come up deal
166:47 - with them immediately
166:48 - and number four is going to be improved
166:50 - management of communications and by this
166:52 - i mean things like email text messages
166:55 - so on so forth
166:57 - if nothing else
166:59 - if you nail those four areas
167:01 - you will be working so much more
167:03 - efficiently than so many people out
167:05 - there that at the end of the work week
167:06 - people will just wonder how you got so
167:08 - much done and the answer to how you got
167:10 - so much done will be
167:12 - you didn't let time just waste away to
167:14 - and get lost to inefficiency all right
167:16 - so let's look at each of the things i
167:18 - just mentioned in term number one the
167:21 - ohio method ohio this stands for only
167:24 - handle at once
167:25 - and this
167:26 - concept applies to anything whether it's
167:28 - an email whether it's a piece of paper
167:31 - sitting on your desk um you know an
167:34 - issue that comes up or anything
167:36 - don't deal with issues more than once so
167:38 - think of it like this a piece of paper
167:41 - comes in you open it open up the letter
167:43 - it's something from the secretary of
167:44 - state saying you've got to file
167:47 - something to renew your business license
167:49 - well don't just set it over here because
167:52 - as soon as you do that
167:54 - now then when you decide to deal with it
167:56 - later you've got to pick it up and read
167:58 - it again which means you took the time
167:59 - to read it when you first opened it and
168:01 - then you took the time to read it uh
168:04 - when you deal with it the second time so
168:05 - you're reading the thing twice instead
168:07 - of once right
168:08 - so when as soon as you pick up a piece
168:10 - of paper
168:12 - deal with it and under that scenario
168:14 - envelope comes in i open it i read it
168:18 - it's from the secretary of state's
168:19 - office saying hey you've got to renew
168:22 - your business license
168:24 - i'm immediately going to put this down
168:25 - i'm going to go online i'm going to
168:27 - renew my business license it's done i
168:29 - only touched that piece of paper once in
168:31 - other words i only handled it once
168:34 - think of how many times in your life
168:35 - have you opened an email
168:37 - read the email
168:38 - and then said i'll deal with this later
168:41 - right well then when you go to deal with
168:43 - it later you have to read the email
168:44 - again which again you just read the
168:45 - email twice
168:47 - so imagine if you could cut your time
168:49 - spent reading email in half right so
168:52 - only handle it once applies to anything
168:54 - from
168:55 - a piece of administrative paperwork to
168:59 - emails to you name it anything that
169:02 - comes across your desk only handle it
169:04 - one time now this can be something that
169:08 - can be like very
169:10 - for lack of a better word difficult for
169:13 - people to implement because it's really
169:15 - easy for something to come in and you
169:17 - look at it and go i don't have time to
169:18 - deal with this and you said it over here
169:19 - then you don't have time to deal with
169:20 - the next thing you set it over here you
169:22 - don't have time to deal with the next
169:23 - thing then like you set it over here and
169:26 - then you go to work on something and you
169:27 - work all day and like you finish that
169:30 - okay but then later on
169:33 - when you look at these again i don't
169:34 - have time to deal with this so you move
169:35 - it back over here next thing you know
169:36 - you've just moved the same pile of
169:38 - papers back and forth five times and
169:39 - think of all that time you've wasted and
169:41 - you felt busy but all you were doing was
169:43 - moving those papers back and forth which
169:45 - is again a massive massive waste of time
169:48 - so you've got to be disciplined in the
169:50 - sense that you're not going to pick
169:51 - something up unless you're prepared to
169:52 - deal with it and then when you do deal
169:53 - with it or i should say when you do pick
169:55 - it up you do deal with it that's
169:57 - something again it can be easy to go i
169:59 - don't have time for this
170:01 - you don't have time
170:03 - not to do things that way your time is
170:05 - so precious you have to get things
170:07 - handled once and only once okay so
170:09 - follow the ohio method that's rule
170:11 - number one only handle it once
170:14 - rule number two is focus on one thing at
170:17 - a time
170:18 - and by this i'm talking about in your
170:20 - development work you need to have one
170:23 - project finish it move on to the next
170:25 - project finish it move on to the next
170:26 - project finish it so
170:29 - like with us for example like let's say
170:31 - we've got i'm making up a number let's
170:33 - say we've got
170:34 - four clients we're building websites for
170:37 - the you know i don't work on client
170:38 - number one a little bit one day work on
170:40 - client number two a little bit
170:42 - of that day same day work on client
170:44 - three a little bit because all you've
170:45 - ever got that way is a little bit of
170:47 - each thing done
170:49 - and the reason that's bad is
170:52 - it requires a lot of mental energy to
170:53 - switch from one project to the next to
170:55 - the next and so you're constantly like
170:57 - getting an efficiency drain by switching
171:00 - projects like that instead what we do
171:02 - let's say we have four websites we're
171:04 - working on
171:05 - we finish the first one we work on it we
171:07 - finish it done out the door then we work
171:10 - on the second one finish it out the door
171:12 - third one finish it out the door so on
171:14 - so forth and if somebody calls and wants
171:17 - a project we tell them okay you're
171:19 - number five in line and we adjust the
171:21 - delivery date accordingly when they ask
171:23 - when can we have it by we give them an
171:24 - honest delivery date because we say
171:26 - we've got four people
171:27 - ahead of you you know just to give an
171:29 - example
171:30 - so
171:31 - don't jump from project to project and
171:33 - as you get busy you're going to have
171:35 - two three four and more projects under
171:38 - contract that you know you're going to
171:40 - be working on get one done then move on
171:42 - to the next one get it done then move on
171:44 - to the next one get it done and so on
171:47 - and so on and so on and if you've got a
171:49 - bunch of projects already
171:51 - lined up to do and somebody calls you
171:53 - wanting more work be honest with them
171:55 - about a delivery date say i've got this
171:57 - many ahead of you and here here's what
171:58 - comes next all right so one thing at a
172:01 - time and it again
172:04 - saves you all that mental energy of
172:05 - switching from project to project to
172:07 - project which is just a huge you know
172:09 - efficiency drain at the end of the day
172:12 - number three when problems come up
172:14 - deal with them immediately and
172:17 - here's what i mean by this is
172:20 - uh it's really easy for you know some
172:23 - for something to come up and then for
172:25 - you to say okay i'll deal with this a
172:28 - little later well if it's a problem and
172:30 - you put it off until later the problem
172:32 - only gets bigger the problem compounds
172:34 - so now it becomes a bigger issue to deal
172:38 - with
172:39 - and that can become a bigger issue to
172:41 - deal with in terms of money it can
172:42 - become a bigger issue to deal with in
172:44 - terms of time it can become a bigger
172:47 - issue to deal with in terms of you know
172:49 - other things so
172:52 - let me let me give you an example
172:55 - easy example i like to use something
172:57 - comes in from the secretary of state
172:59 - saying you've got to send a piece of
173:01 - paper in to renew your business license
173:04 - and
173:06 - things fall through the cracks and it
173:08 - doesn't get done so now you're late
173:10 - sending in your business license you get
173:12 - a notice from the secretary of state
173:14 - saying
173:15 - um
173:17 - you know
173:18 - you are now
173:19 - going to have to pay an extra 100 for
173:21 - your business license that's a problem a
173:23 - problem has just arisen you now have to
173:25 - get your business license renewed and
173:27 - there's an extra amount um associated
173:29 - with it by dealing with things as soon
173:32 - as you get them then bam they're taken
173:34 - care of right uh you know if you get an
173:36 - unhappy customer get them on the phone
173:38 - right away get it dealt with you're like
173:40 - right away if you see things in your
173:42 - business that seem like they're causing
173:44 - an efficiency eliminate them on the spot
173:46 - don't say oh man we really got to clean
173:48 - up that process no eliminate them right
173:49 - there on the spot don't let them cost
173:51 - you more time as things go on when
173:53 - problems come up get them dealt with and
173:55 - get them dealt with on the spot i cannot
173:58 - stress that enough
174:00 - number four is your management of
174:02 - communications and this is a big one
174:05 - communications are one of the biggest
174:08 - things that can make you feel busy even
174:10 - though you're not actually producing
174:11 - anything all right
174:13 - so
174:14 - let's look at the two ways that you can
174:16 - manage your communications in a way that
174:18 - will greatly and i do mean greatly
174:20 - greatly greatly
174:21 - uh increase your productivity all right
174:24 - and the first thing you can do in
174:25 - managing your communications is avoid
174:27 - real-time communication platforms like
174:29 - slack uh google hangouts and and things
174:32 - of that nature where it's more of a chat
174:35 - than it is um you know like a formal
174:37 - message
174:39 - it's really easy
174:41 - like on a service like slack for example
174:44 - to constantly see messages coming
174:46 - through and then when someone gets a
174:47 - message others are prompted to respond
174:49 - and so on so forth and you wind up
174:51 - having a much higher message volume than
174:54 - you would through a medium such as email
174:57 - and the thing is number one every time
174:58 - you get one of those messages you become
175:00 - highly distracted and it gets hard to
175:02 - get back to what you were doing and you
175:03 - get into a workflow and number two the
175:06 - overwhelming majority of those messages
175:08 - you're getting through a real-time
175:09 - service such as slack aren't actionable
175:11 - anyway they're just noise okay so
175:14 - you're basically filling your day with
175:16 - noise
175:17 - which makes you feel busy but again you
175:19 - don't actually produce anything avoid
175:21 - real-time communications altogether i
175:24 - cannot stress that enough we do not use
175:25 - them in our businesses we don't use
175:26 - slack we don't use google hangouts we
175:28 - don't use
175:29 - any of those things
175:31 - and on the subject of communications
175:34 - manage your email properly so and what i
175:36 - mean by that is
175:39 - go through your email one to two times a
175:41 - day or however often you feel is
175:43 - appropriate but set aside
175:44 - set times that you're going to go
175:46 - through your email
175:47 - and avoid your email during all other
175:50 - times think of it like this
175:53 - you sit down
175:54 - you open your inbox
175:56 - you get a message from a client
175:59 - you respond to it
176:01 - client responds back you respond to it
176:03 - again client responds back you respond
176:05 - again client response back
176:07 - okay that's three or four emails from
176:09 - the client you had to read
176:11 - and that's three or four responses
176:14 - you've had to write
176:15 - now we all know a lot of people use
176:17 - email in a way where as soon as a
176:19 - thought enters their head they gotta
176:20 - fire off an email to somebody about it
176:22 - right
176:23 - if you say i'm only gonna go through my
176:25 - email once a day and that's it so like
176:27 - let's say for example you're gonna go
176:28 - through your email at three in the
176:30 - afternoon from three to four you're
176:31 - gonna clear your email
176:33 - when you get up and or get to work i
176:35 - should say in the morning
176:37 - you've got
176:38 - one one email in your inbox from joe
176:40 - client
176:42 - during the course of the day joe sends
176:43 - you three or four more emails
176:45 - well now at you know three or four in
176:47 - the afternoon when you're gonna go
176:49 - through your email
176:50 - you can read all four or five emails joe
176:52 - sent you at one time and then you can
176:55 - send them a consolidated response to all
176:56 - of them right
176:58 - so in other words you get to type one
176:59 - response
177:00 - as opposed to
177:02 - typing three or four or five
177:04 - individual responses that becomes a huge
177:06 - time saver and the other thing is you
177:09 - actually have less email to read by
177:12 - following that
177:14 - approach because if joe is going to
177:15 - email you three four or five times
177:17 - during the day anyway
177:19 - if you're responding to each of those
177:21 - then he's likely to respond to your
177:23 - responses so you go from getting four or
177:25 - five emails in a day from joe to getting
177:26 - 15 right
177:28 - so you greatly reduce
177:30 - the number of emails
177:32 - you have to read
177:34 - by going through your email
177:36 - once a day or twice a day and but again
177:39 - leaving your inbox closed at all other
177:42 - times or if it's not going to be closed
177:44 - at least not responding so set aside set
177:47 - times that you're going to respond to
177:49 - email and then go through it using the
177:51 - ohio method which we discussed a minute
177:53 - ago so if an email asks you for
177:55 - something don't just respond and say
177:56 - i'll get back to you on that respond
177:58 - with what the email actually asks for
178:00 - and only go through that inbox once a
178:02 - day and you will be surprised at how
178:03 - much less time you spend
178:05 - than your competitors going through
178:07 - email
178:08 - so
178:10 - let's put together everything we just
178:12 - talked about
178:13 - let's say your competitor does not
178:16 - follow the only handle at once method
178:18 - which was number one
178:20 - which means
178:21 - your competitors that work 40 hours a
178:23 - week
178:24 - and they probably spend 10 hours just
178:25 - moving the same stack of paper back and
178:27 - forth like we talked about right so
178:29 - number one they don't follow the ohio
178:30 - method so how much time are they losing
178:32 - there
178:33 - number two your competitors
178:35 - jumping between projects all the time
178:37 - which means they don't produce as much
178:39 - right
178:40 - so let's say they lose
178:42 - you know an hour a day moving the paper
178:44 - back and forth by not using the ohio
178:46 - method let's say they lose 30 minutes of
178:48 - productivity a day
178:50 - by
178:51 - jumping from project to project now
178:53 - they've lost an hour and a half of
178:55 - productivity you know a day
178:57 - let's say they don't deal problems
178:59 - immediately and as a result the problems
179:01 - become more time consuming later let's
179:03 - add 15 minutes or up to an hour and 45
179:05 - minutes a day now let's suppose that due
179:08 - to inefficient communication practices
179:10 - which is what we just talked about with
179:11 - real-time communication services and
179:13 - email let's say
179:15 - they lose another two hours a day
179:17 - in an eight hour day we've just lost
179:19 - probably three to four hours three hours
179:21 - 45 minutes for you so call it three to
179:24 - four hours
179:25 - to essentially
179:26 - inefficiency so
179:28 - if you go to work for eight hours and
179:30 - that person goes to work for eight hours
179:33 - and they're losing let's say four hours
179:34 - of their their data inefficiency and
179:37 - you're not
179:38 - you're gonna produce twice as much as
179:40 - they are in an hour day
179:42 - which means you're going to make twice
179:44 - as much money as they do working the
179:45 - same amount of hours
179:48 - now combine that with the last section
179:49 - of our video where we talked about the
179:51 - need to put in a few extra hours and
179:53 - combine that
179:54 - extra productivity with
179:57 - those extra hours and actually know your
179:58 - income shoots through the roof right
180:01 - so
180:02 - again
180:03 - time but also productivity so focus on
180:07 - the tips we've just talked about
180:09 - in this and you are going to be fine
180:11 - so and you will actually see your income
180:13 - go up substantially
180:15 - well this is going to wrap up our course
180:17 - on how to succeed as a freelance
180:19 - developer i hope you found this helpful
