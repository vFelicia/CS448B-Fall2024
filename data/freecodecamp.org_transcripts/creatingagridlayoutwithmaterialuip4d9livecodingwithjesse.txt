00:06 - hey everybody and welcome to live coding
00:10 - with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're
00:16 - going to make a grid layout material UI
00:22 - is the framework that we're using the
00:27 - style or react app and they have this
00:31 - grid component built in so we're gonna
00:38 - use that but we're gonna make it
00:43 - possible for the user to switch between
00:45 - views so the grid view will be one
00:48 - possible view of several so we'll
00:52 - probably just work on two views today
00:53 - the grid view and then the main view
00:56 - which will probably will be the default
01:00 - we've already seen that so probably we
01:05 - won't really need to work on it that
01:06 - much but we will need to make sure that
01:09 - we can switch back and forth so I
01:11 - haven't decided yet with the best way to
01:13 - do that is and by that I mean how are we
01:18 - going to handle how that information is
01:22 - passed between components in terms of
01:25 - what the view should be so I'm gonna
01:28 - start by telling you what I think the
01:35 - the solution could be and then getting
01:38 - feedback from you all and depending on
01:41 - what feedback I get that'll determine
01:43 - how we solve that problem so say just
01:50 - today is Friday the 13th so I'm not
01:52 - really superstitious at all but if you
01:57 - are superstitious about that sort of
01:59 - thing watch your back today
02:01 - cuz it's Friday the 13th uh-huh all
02:06 - right let me take the live chat real
02:08 - quick to say hi
02:12 - world says you look less tired today
02:14 - okay that's cool I'll take that I'm
02:21 - actually I was trying to think if I got
02:26 - a sleep I don't even remember how much
02:28 - sleep I got I was up earlier than normal
02:33 - with kids but I think I got at least 7
02:39 - hours so let's see I'm surprised I think
02:49 - I actually looked really weird on this
02:51 - camera because I got different lighting
02:52 - coming from my screens depending on
02:54 - whether I have a light screen or a dark
02:56 - screen so it's always odd to see myself
03:00 - like that oh okay all right let me let
03:07 - me fill you in on what happened
03:08 - yesterday so Sebastian asked about the
03:10 - issue with the resource center that we
03:12 - looked at at the end of the stream
03:14 - yesterday so I had actually forgotten
03:16 - about that until you brought it up so
03:21 - and it looks like my mic is still
03:23 - popping I wonder if maybe it's it's not
03:31 - my phone
03:31 - so the phone's far away the cords
03:35 - farther away than it's ever been
03:38 - hmm if it keeps popping if it keeps
03:45 - popping and it gets really bad let me
03:48 - know and I will just switch over to the
03:53 - the built-in mic all right it's good now
03:55 - okay yeah he said if it gets really bad
03:57 - I'll just switch over I'm using an
03:59 - external mic now but I could just use
04:01 - the one that's built into the iMac and
04:04 - the mic I got it wasn't really that
04:06 - expensive so if it's if it's breaking
04:09 - then I guess that's what I get from
04:11 - buying a cheap mic okay so here's what
04:16 - the problem was so we had correctly set
04:24 - up the
04:25 - max file size in the in our server Jas
04:30 - file this was for the our last project
04:33 - project 2 which was the Resource Center
04:35 - we had set up a file upload form and we
04:38 - used form Z was it forms e no no we use
04:42 - form Z for client-side form validation
04:46 - server side we used formidable SWE's
04:50 - node formidable and we set our max file
04:55 - size and we had it said it's something
04:58 - very reasonable I can't remember exactly
05:00 - what it was but it should have been able
05:02 - to handle the amount of data that was
05:05 - going in so I it occurred to me that oh
05:11 - maybe nginx needs to be said and I
05:15 - looked it up and it turns out the
05:17 - default max upload size for nginx is one
05:22 - megabyte so anytime someone was
05:26 - exceeding that one megabyte either with
05:30 - one file it was big or the total of all
05:33 - files that were being uploaded then it
05:36 - was failing not it wasn't even getting
05:41 - you know to our server das file it was
05:44 - failing at our nginx level which we were
05:47 - using as a reverse proxy on that
05:49 - digitalocean droplet so I just looked up
05:54 - how to increase the the max upload size
05:59 - so I increased the max upload size and
06:01 - then I increase the the time out I
06:03 - forget what it was called but basically
06:05 - I increased the amount of time it would
06:08 - allow something to be uploaded that
06:11 - fixed the problem so that was it and I
06:14 - think it was Sebastian was it you who
06:16 - said it was probably the the upload size
06:18 - so you were you're definitely right
06:21 - about that I just was thinking that
06:23 - somehow it was in our server J's file
06:25 - that we had mess it up but we didn't
06:27 - that was that was fun it was with nginx
06:31 - and that was entirely on me because I
06:35 - don't think I set up that server on the
06:36 - stream so had I done so
06:38 - one of you all will probably would have
06:40 - thought of it but I didn't so we're
06:43 - gonna have to keep that in mind for this
06:45 - project because we will of will we have
06:48 - a file upload I think we might I'll have
06:54 - to double check on the other we're not
06:55 - gonna work on it today so it doesn't
06:56 - matter but I'll double check on the live
06:58 - version of this project and see if we
07:01 - have a file upload ok so let's see ok so
07:12 - it wasn't you so somebody said something
07:14 - about file upload so I don't remember
07:16 - who it was but whoever it was you were
07:18 - right see everybody are giving it to you
07:24 - hey Gideon she's late today don't worry
07:27 - you you weren't that late just a few
07:30 - minutes ok oh ok awesome
07:34 - fontsize is that better does that work
07:44 - ok alright let's get started and I am
07:50 - gonna remember to set my timer today so
07:54 - I want to do kind of a shorter stream
07:56 - today depends on how things go but it's
07:57 - Friday and I want to go home and see my
08:01 - family so so I don't want to stream for
08:04 - a really long time because I wanted to
08:07 - want to get out of here uh-huh
08:09 - so we're gonna do at least one session
08:14 - maybe two we'll see how it goes
08:18 - ok so let's get started let me show you
08:21 - what's going on right now I have done
08:23 - some things so far depending on how much
08:27 - time we have at the end I might review
08:29 - the pull request but just be aware we've
08:31 - I've merged two pool requests one from
08:33 - Harshit one from Sebastian and both
08:37 - awesome pool requests so you can review
08:42 - those as pour quest six and seven we're
08:46 - going to see some of the changes because
08:48 - we're going to be working on the same
08:49 - files that were changed
08:52 - but I'm not gonna try to go home right
08:57 - now but I will go over them later if we
09:01 - have time
09:02 - okay so here's kind of a demonstration
09:04 - of using this grid component so hard
09:08 - should actually put the grid component
09:09 - in on his pull request so I modified it
09:12 - slightly but that was part of his pull
09:17 - requests you can see you can see the
09:20 - other part as well so we now have a
09:22 - responsive sidebar so it automatically
09:26 - hives or shows depending on screen width
09:29 - so that's awesome that's exactly the
09:33 - behavior that we wanted from that
09:34 - component so so thanks again for that
09:39 - Harshit and it's actually those were the
09:46 - those are the big parts of this pull
09:47 - request so I guess we did review it at
09:51 - least from this end of things
09:52 - so basically when we have the grid view
09:55 - we want things to stack up like this and
09:58 - let me see we'd probably when the screen
10:02 - got this big we probably want to go even
10:04 - smaller but I just put some numbers in
10:09 - there just to to demonstrate so we
10:12 - dropped down to two columns that we drop
10:14 - down to one and then when we go to our
10:20 - our default view is going to look like
10:23 - what we have here so this is what we
10:28 - want our default view to look like and
10:30 - then we've just seen the grid view so
10:32 - those are the two views that we want we
10:34 - want to be able to talk them with toggle
10:35 - them from this button up here I can zoom
10:41 - trying to zoom in here and it's not
10:43 - working I don't know what's going on the
10:47 - batteries are almost dead on my trackpad
10:49 - there we go so I may have to change out
10:52 - the batteries here in the middle of
10:53 - stream but when we press this what we
10:56 - want to happen is that icon will change
11:04 - because the second click will take you
11:09 - back to the default view so we'll have
11:10 - two icons that change in and out
11:12 - depending on what you click here then
11:15 - obviously we want all of these cards
11:20 - that have our posts to go to the new
11:23 - layout based on the click so here's what
11:26 - here's what I'm thinking about actually
11:31 - I wrote this down so I wouldn't forget
11:33 - um
11:34 - so actually wrote it down on a piece of
11:37 - paper with a real pen so really
11:41 - old-school today haha so here's what we
11:45 - need we need to be able to pass the the
11:50 - value so I don't know we're gonna state
11:53 - or something but we need the components
11:57 - to be aware so we need obviously this
12:01 - app bar component to be aware of what
12:04 - the user selected for the view the view
12:06 - type the the layout type we also need
12:10 - this category J S component to be aware
12:13 - of the layout type so what we need then
12:21 - and then with this we go a couple of
12:24 - ways so do we just have the state exist
12:30 - in the app bar component and then pass
12:32 - it down as a prop to our category J S
12:36 - component because this app bar I believe
12:40 - lives in our layout or layout component
12:48 - so potentially the state could exist at
12:51 - the layout component and be passed down
12:53 - as a prop to our app bar and if you're
12:58 - not familiar with react this is probably
13:00 - really confusing I'm gonna describe this
13:02 - now but then we're actually going to go
13:03 - in and do the code and hopefully it'll
13:05 - be less confusing for you so that's one
13:10 - option right we just take the the parent
13:14 - component of both of those and we have
13:16 - the state there we
13:17 - pass it down as props that's a
13:21 - possibility the other possibility is do
13:28 - we have our global or store basically so
13:31 - I know we're not using Redux directly
13:34 - now because we switched out for Apollo
13:36 - which uses Redux behind the scenes
13:39 - anyway so I guess what my question is is
13:42 - if we wanted to have a global store that
13:46 - would hold that value so that any of our
13:48 - components could have access to it would
13:53 - we be able to do that with Apollo or
13:56 - would we need to bring react back into
14:00 - the or redux I'm sorry Redux back into
14:03 - the picture and use Redux for that or or
14:10 - is that unnecessary now we will have we
14:16 - will have some other views and
14:18 - potentially we might have some other
14:20 - data that should be in some sort of
14:22 - global store so Redux if it has to be
14:26 - Redux and we can't do it with Apollo
14:29 - Redux may seem like overkill for this
14:32 - one thing but I suspect we're going to
14:35 - have some other pieces of data that
14:36 - would be useful to having a global store
14:43 - so I'll let you you all think about that
14:49 - if you have any thoughts just put it in
14:51 - the live chat for now we may as well
14:55 - spend some time getting this grid layout
14:58 - to look how we want it to look and
15:03 - that'll give us all some time to think
15:05 - about what we want to do I mean we can
15:08 - always implement one solution and then
15:10 - switch later if we need to but I was
15:14 - actually I was gonna try to do it
15:15 - earlier and then I thought no I want I
15:17 - want advice from you all on this before
15:20 - I before I actually implement it so
15:25 - let's get to some code
15:29 - let's see since we're gonna be working
15:30 - on this first let's check this up now
15:32 - here's the the thing that I'm not sure
15:35 - about I did mess around with this a
15:37 - little bit and I kept getting errors and
15:39 - I decided to just remove what I was
15:41 - doing and I figured we'll redo it on the
15:43 - stream and it'll be easier for everyone
15:45 - to follow so in our category J s let me
15:54 - make some space here in our category J s
16:02 - file right now you see some of the stuff
16:07 - has changed but basically the the main
16:09 - thing here is that we've imported this
16:11 - grid component so first we have this
16:15 - container this grid container if you
16:17 - want to check out what's going on look
16:19 - at the docs for material UI make sure
16:22 - you go to the newest version the beta
16:24 - version and then check on the under the
16:26 - Layout tab you can see more about this
16:28 - grid there's a lot of other options we
16:31 - could do but for now we're using this
16:33 - grid container and then for each of our
16:37 - posts we're gonna have this grid item
16:42 - right so each post each card will be
16:47 - wrapped in this grid item and right now
16:49 - we have it set on small screens to take
16:51 - up 12 so this is a column thing much
16:53 - like we used with the column classes in
16:57 - materialized CSS very similar to that so
17:02 - we have extra small is takes up 12 so
17:05 - the full width then half width on small
17:07 - and then a third on medium screens I'm
17:12 - assuming large is LG so let's go with
17:16 - large and we'll just pop put in four
17:20 - right here so I think I want that anyway
17:23 - let me put in the N grok link I forgot
17:26 - to do that at the beginning so I already
17:28 - started it up before the stream and
17:36 - okay if you're not familiar with how we
17:40 - do things I look at the live chat again
17:43 - after our Pomodoro session is up so in
17:46 - about 15 minutes I'll get to the live
17:47 - chat so please don't think that I'm
17:50 - ignoring you I will get to all the
17:53 - comments and questions in the live chat
17:55 - soon okay so since we've wrapped that
18:00 - component let's I want to go ahead and
18:02 - see what this looks like with four yeah
18:04 - okay it's four obviously we don't have
18:06 - enough posts to really see the four
18:08 - columns but you can you can guess write
18:11 - it there would be two more okay so
18:22 - here's the the first thing that I need
18:28 - to do we need to handle so if we're
18:30 - going to keep it like this we need some
18:33 - way to either change these values or
18:39 - just make use a ternary right like an if
18:43 - statement and render it this way or the
18:46 - original way we were rendering it like
18:49 - yesterday right how we render it on the
18:51 - home page because here's what happens
18:56 - let me move make large 12 so this is
19:00 - what happens if we just try to change
19:01 - the value to 12
19:03 - it gets really big so we don't want that
19:09 - so if there's some way I mean
19:18 - realistically we could just set a max
19:20 - width on the cars right I guess that's
19:26 - an option
19:33 - I'm assuming that this would just be
19:35 - positioned in the middle we can let's
19:37 - try that let's sit on Macs with I have
19:48 - dev tools open on my other screen here
19:50 - so I'm just gonna set a max width and
19:54 - dev tools just to try it out go 500
19:57 - pixels okay so it actually isn't it
20:05 - doesn't get centered I'm not sure if we
20:09 - could okay so we could potentially just
20:17 - give it a max width of however many
20:20 - pixels we want and then a margin:0 auto
20:23 - and that that would work okay that's not
20:32 - bad
20:37 - that's actually not too bad my initial
20:40 - idea was to just have basically
20:44 - duplicate this take out the grid and
20:48 - then render one of the other based on
20:50 - the view but if all we have to do is add
20:55 - or take away those two lines of CSS that
21:02 - just may be the simplest approach that
21:03 - would result in the least amount of code
21:08 - so
21:16 - let's do that
21:27 - who
21:38 - okay so I think that's settled
21:42 - now let's see okay Omar says you could
21:50 - do like the the column offset John
21:54 - Hanson says you could flex justify items
22:06 - okay and Sebastien says there is
22:08 - something built in alright let's check
22:10 - that out
22:11 - I'd much rather work with what's built
22:12 - into material UI rather than just use
22:15 - some CSS to override I mean this in this
22:20 - case the override is just like really
22:22 - obvious and easy but still I think if we
22:26 - can use what's built in the material I
22:28 - we have less of a chance of like weird
22:31 - things happening in our UI that are that
22:36 - we haven't thought of you know on some
22:37 - browser screen with device combination
22:40 - we might have something weird happen we
22:44 - won't know about it we're less likely to
22:46 - have that happen if we don't try to
22:48 - override things in material UI okay so
22:52 - let's check it out then
23:03 - where we had layouts grid
23:18 - should we use the center then
23:38 - okay Sebastian says the last one is demo
23:45 - okay where we have things centered all
23:47 - right let's see what it what it looks
23:49 - like
24:05 - all right so if we justify:center in a
24:11 - line Center then so I guess this would
24:19 - be basically what we need just a it's
24:28 - just a five direction
24:40 - okay let's try it out so is that again
24:56 - okay so this is a container it's just
24:58 - inside sorry that's probably really
25:00 - small I'm I didn't even think about it
25:02 - okay let's see I do want to set this is
25:08 - I don't want these centered there we go
25:13 - I didn't want them centered on the page
25:15 - you remember we tried that on a previous
25:17 - project and it was it seemed like a good
25:19 - idea but then we actually look at it it
25:21 - was really weird okay so we do just want
25:25 - justified center okay
25:37 - alright let's try it this should be
25:39 - pretty simple I think if we just say
25:42 - justify let's separate this out a bit
25:53 - and it is Center right yet Center
26:06 - okay
26:08 - check it out now okay it looks like
26:20 - we would probably still need a max-width
26:26 - but it should be centered now so if we
26:28 - give it the max width and it's not
26:47 - yeah okay so what happened to great dude
26:54 - you just fess in it
26:55 - all right let's look back here and see
26:56 - if we miss something
27:12 - all right let's make sure we have
27:13 - direction row as well
27:24 - ro
27:33 - all right I'm just gonna put the
27:35 - max-width right on these because it's
27:41 - getting annoying to do it every time
27:46 - whoops style
27:58 - all right
28:05 - now that's weird
28:15 - I guess I could put it on here
28:25 - all right cool that works
28:36 - let me go back actually not that did not
28:42 - work I wanted it to work we need all
28:51 - right let me check the live chat and see
28:53 - if I'm missing something that you all
28:56 - have seen
29:24 - okay
29:27 - Blake asks what's the material UI link
29:30 - its material - UI calm all right let's
29:42 - think maybe this isn't going to be the
29:44 - the simplest way
29:55 - all right let's see yeah so it's messing
30:04 - up what we're doing here the max width
30:09 - is but this max width has no effect
30:26 - hmm
30:28 - so let's get rid of this
30:39 - I want to inspect this quickly and see
30:43 - what's happening with that max with and
30:46 - if it's being applied anywhere
30:49 - all right so never grid and then within
30:56 - that
31:19 - okay I see all right we're a little bit
31:23 - stuck right so I've just manually set
31:29 - max with and dev tools and you'll see
31:31 - the highlighted portion right now is the
31:34 - the div that is from the grid component
31:38 - and then this div that's highlighted now
31:42 - is the card component so you could see
31:48 - the the orangish part there is is the
31:51 - margin so the grid I don't know if the
31:57 - grids gonna be able to Center this the
31:58 - way we wants so we might be better off
32:01 - just doing a little bit of our own CSS
32:14 - yes the Sebastian says the problem is
32:16 - that the large 12 will use full width on
32:19 - the large screen and that's it but if we
32:22 - want it to be one column then we have to
32:28 - use the 12
32:40 - okay all right let's see
32:58 - alright let's get rid of this for now
32:59 - actually this might not be applying
33:01 - because it's possible that we're not
33:04 - passing the styles on to the dis
33:07 - component to left to remember that now
33:15 - so I guess I'll leave this in here for
33:17 - now okay my timer is up let's do five
33:24 - minutes a question answer and that'll
33:26 - give us all a minute to think about this
33:29 - as well really I probably should just do
33:32 - something so that we can move on and we
33:34 - can always change it if we want to later
33:41 - on all right let me scroll up and stop
33:45 - going through here
33:58 - I see a lot of you also saying hi hey
34:00 - hey everybody I see some some new people
34:08 - in the live chat I haven't haven't seen
34:10 - the names before so welcome thank you
34:12 - for for joining us for the live stream
34:31 - Nikhil says me maybe the sidebar could
34:35 - be improved in terms of user interface
34:37 - yeah I think it could it's it's still
34:40 - work-in-progress now so I'm not I want
34:45 - to get all of our options on the sidebar
34:49 - first and then I'm gonna adjust it at
34:53 - that point so this this is not going to
34:56 - be it's um its final form so I
35:02 - definitely agree with that okay
35:09 - Sebastian says so earlier when I was
35:11 - talking about whether or not we have a
35:14 - global store or we just pass things down
35:17 - as props to components from a parent
35:21 - component Sebastian says if you have a
35:24 - global store then yes include it there
35:26 - if not you can use react state directly
35:28 - and switch components based on the state
35:30 - I think that's that's going to be the
35:37 - simplest way to do it is just to keep
35:40 - the state and the parent component and
35:42 - pass it down to the child components and
35:46 - if it gets more complex later on we
35:50 - could always add Redux if we have to
35:56 - xavier says what's your opinion on CSS
35:58 - grids okay and rook asks for some
36:07 - clarification saying do you mean the CSS
36:10 - feature called grid or the thing
36:12 - bootstrap and other CSX CSS frameworks
36:15 - do let's see okay it doesn't look like
36:21 - Xavier responded so Xavier I'm gonna
36:26 - assume that I just answered both either
36:30 - way so if we're talking about the grid
36:33 - structure that's common among CSS
36:35 - frameworks I think it's really easy to
36:37 - work with
36:39 - so despite my problems with this this
36:43 - framework here I I like them I think it
36:48 - makes it very easy to do responsive
36:52 - layouts I haven't worked directly with
36:56 - the the new CSS feature that is grid
37:00 - that much at all I basically just kind
37:02 - of read a little bit about it so
37:04 - honestly I think any new feature of CSS
37:07 - is a good thing right it you don't have
37:10 - to use it so it's not it's not really
37:14 - bad because you could just choose not to
37:16 - use it but since it's there you have the
37:18 - potential to use it on something so I'm
37:23 - hopeful that it'll be very useful so I
37:27 - just need to learn a little bit more
37:29 - about it before I start using it
37:34 - Blake's asks can you change the color of
37:36 - the wave effect on the category buttons
37:39 - probably oh yeah yeah I can definitely
37:44 - change it it will change at some point
37:53 - see
38:08 - all right Nikhil says could something
38:12 - like an image holder be used here like
38:14 - when the website loves their these
38:17 - frames slash image holders present then
38:20 - the image loads that might speed up the
38:22 - website a bit improve the UI yeah let me
38:29 - think yeah we might might be able to do
38:37 - that I'll probably wait till later on if
38:40 - everything runs really fast then I
38:43 - probably won't bother implementing
38:46 - something like that but if we are
38:50 - running into some performance issues
38:51 - then that would be good to to have in
38:54 - there what do they call it premature
39:00 - optimization right so yeah but that'll
39:04 - be good to put in if we need it later on
39:08 - if we have time
39:23 - okay I'm almost to the bottom of the
39:25 - live chat so my timer went up but I'm
39:27 - just going to answer these last few rook
39:31 - ass is that dark github theme a standard
39:34 - feature the white is kind of blinding
39:36 - yeah it's not a standard feature it is a
39:41 - I have this plug-in called tampermonkey
39:45 - that lets me run scripts on certain
39:48 - pages so I use that plug plug in with
39:53 - another thing called github dark so with
40:00 - those two things it gives me all these
40:02 - options of various like a dark theme but
40:07 - I could I could change it so I they have
40:11 - pre-made themes but then also you could
40:15 - customize it even further if you wanted
40:17 - to
40:25 - I never tried any of these other things
40:27 - maybe I should try them one day anyway
40:32 - so that's it
40:40 - okay michael says hey Jesse I never
40:43 - catch these live love the streams always
40:45 - catch them later the same day oh well
40:47 - I'm really glad that you could be here
40:49 - live for this dream that's awesome
40:58 - Nino says is this video for advice or
41:01 - front end for advance front end it just
41:05 - depends on what we're working on so
41:07 - sometimes we work on more advanced
41:09 - topics for front end occasionally we do
41:11 - work back in and DevOps stuff mostly
41:15 - front end though sometimes we go over
41:16 - some basic front end stuff so it just
41:18 - kind of depends on what we're working on
41:20 - day to day for this
41:23 - I don't know this stream falls maybe
41:26 - somewhere in the middle I don't really
41:27 - think it's that advanced but if you're
41:29 - not familiar with react some of it might
41:31 - be kind of confusing so hang in there
41:35 - and ask you so many questions as you
41:37 - want if anything is confusing let's see
41:43 - alright last question and then we're
41:44 - going back to the code in actually so in
41:52 - is it pronounced in uh or or ina
41:56 - let me know I don't want to I don't want
42:00 - to mess it up
42:08 - all right let me start the timer
42:15 - first is correct
42:17 - inna okay awesome yeah if I ever
42:22 - pronounce any of your names incorrectly
42:25 - call me out on it let me know I I want
42:28 - to get them right okay so I guess we're
42:36 - doing two Pomodoro sessions I know I
42:37 - said I was gonna do one but now that I'm
42:39 - into it I want to get something done
42:42 - here okay I just saw it Anna kills
42:51 - comment here about the logo and the
42:56 - adjacent top RSS okay watch this said
43:10 - where's my there we go here it is okay
43:13 - um yeah actually you know what I was
43:15 - looking at this earlier today and I kind
43:17 - of thought the same thing what do you
43:18 - all think is it okay that these are
43:20 - different sizes or would it look a lot
43:22 - better if let's say this line lined up
43:25 - with with the bottom of the app bar so
43:28 - we'd either make the logo smaller or the
43:30 - app bar bigger I like the size for the
43:33 - logo I'm a little hesitant to make make
43:37 - it smaller I think it could be slightly
43:39 - smaller so maybe it needs to be a
43:41 - compromise where we meet right about
43:42 - here I'm a big fan of a slim taut nav
43:46 - but in this case this does look a little
43:50 - weird let me know what you'll think
43:52 - potentially though it might not look
43:55 - quite as weird if we take out this line
44:01 - we'll see I want to know what you all
44:04 - think and then maybe we could try some
44:07 - several different options not on today's
44:09 - stream but on another stream we'll try
44:12 - it out okay so let's get this thing done
44:16 - here because I spent a whole Pomodoro
44:19 - session just trying to get this lined up
44:21 - in the middle okay I see there's a lot
44:26 - of stuff coming up in the live chat now
44:28 - just want to let you know for those who
44:29 - are just joining us I will get to all
44:32 - your questions in the live chat as soon
44:34 - as this Pomodoro session is over so I
44:37 - just started one so we have in 23
44:39 - minutes I'm going to go back to the live
44:40 - chat I'm gonna answer everything so if
44:42 - you can't stick around to hear the
44:43 - answer live you can hear the answer
44:45 - later on when this the recording of the
44:49 - stream is available on the free code
44:51 - camp YouTube channel all right let's do
44:55 - this
44:55 - so here's what I'm gonna do for now just
44:57 - so that we can get something that works
44:59 - and worried about how we're gonna handle
45:02 - state because that was that's really the
45:04 - big issue that I'm more concerned about
45:07 - this is this issue is like we know how
45:12 - to make it work we're just trying to
45:13 - figure out the best way to do it
45:15 - so for now
45:19 - Center all right we can get rid of this
45:27 - right because we didn't hoops not all of
45:30 - that we can get rid of these I don't
45:33 - think we were actually we actually need
45:36 - that also we can get rid of this oh no
45:42 - you know what I think I want to keep
45:43 - that yeah let's keep that here and then
45:50 - yeah and then we'll give it a margin of
45:57 - zero Otto all right so that's how we'll
46:01 - settle it the zero means top and bottom
46:03 - margin is 0 and then Auto means it just
46:08 - automatically fills in the left right
46:10 - margin equally but now we need to
46:13 - actually pass these in to that component
46:15 - so let's check out our post preview
46:16 - component which I don't have it up right
46:23 - now so let's go back to hear those
46:26 - preview ok so let's see all right we
46:31 - actually we have styles here class name
46:56 - let's see if that's enough to do it I
46:58 - don't remember how I've done this in the
47:00 - past
47:00 - oops styles not too fine up
47:13 - awesome that did it okay let me explain
47:15 - what I did in case you're not familiar
47:16 - with react so in our category ojs file
47:19 - we had put this style these styles right
47:23 - and think of this as just inline CSS
47:26 - it's really a JavaScript object but
47:29 - that's how how we do it in react so
47:32 - initially it didn't work because this
47:36 - component it wasn't really rendering
47:39 - anything to the Dom right it was it was
47:41 - rendering this component this post
47:43 - preview component and then on this
47:45 - component what really ends up getting
47:47 - rendered is you know this card which in
47:50 - itself is a whole other component so
47:52 - there's a lot of layers to it but
47:53 - basically what we needed to do was pass
47:56 - it the style so we're passing the Styles
47:58 - down from parent to child component and
48:00 - at first it didn't work because with
48:04 - this component instead of having to type
48:06 - this props style we bring everything in
48:11 - here and then we don't have to type this
48:15 - props so really useful to do it that way
48:22 - just in terms of in this case it
48:24 - wouldn't been a big deal but if you have
48:26 - to type the same prop over and over
48:27 - again or a lot of props you can save a
48:29 - lot of a lot of characters by doing it
48:32 - like this okay so that's what we did so
48:35 - now what we have then we can go so you
48:41 - can see it still works so we should be
48:47 - able to keep let's just let's try this
48:52 - actually this might have just simplified
48:54 - things a lot for us so if we go back to
48:57 - three with this one great
49:06 - all right so what this means is we
49:11 - actually only need to change one thing
49:14 - in this component we can leave these
49:16 - styles here that's not a problem all we
49:21 - have to do is change this value we'll
49:26 - probably want to change it across the
49:28 - board yeah we'll probably want to change
49:34 - it across the board to twelve but now we
49:42 - don't have to worry about changing any
49:44 - styles all right so let's do this now
49:49 - we're gonna go all the way up to our
49:51 - parent component for all of this so if
49:56 - you see our layout so this is where
50:02 - we're actually rendering this component
50:05 - so this is the category component and
50:07 - this is a stateless functional component
50:09 - but then we also have this render
50:12 - categories okay and that's a child
50:17 - component of of category right but we
50:22 - also wrapping this in layouts layout is
50:26 - where we bring in our app bar as well so
50:32 - let's see
50:39 - actually it might be a little bit more
50:40 - complicated than I thought so
51:13 - so lay out
51:28 - I'm trying to think of whether or not
51:31 - the state should live in layout or it
51:33 - should it live in cat category I would
51:40 - rather have it live in layout because I
51:42 - want this these views to persist across
51:47 - you know the home view and category
51:52 - views and whatever other thing we have
51:53 - so we will have some other things let's
51:58 - see
52:21 - okay
52:24 - okay so here's the thing how if we make
52:28 - the state live and lay out is there even
52:31 - any way for me to pass something from
52:40 - lay out to you know any of these
52:48 - components
52:59 - see
53:05 - I don't know it is kind of looking like
53:08 - maybe we should have a global store my
53:10 - thing is is this basically if we have
53:14 - the state live here in Category then
53:18 - we're going to have the state living in
53:21 - two different places so we're going to
53:22 - have it here in Category and then we're
53:24 - also going to have it in you know the
53:26 - regular home view so we're gonna have to
53:31 - have it at home you as well let's see
53:40 - yeah
53:49 - so we're now gonna have consistency
53:52 - across state we don't want two different
53:54 - states we're not really going to be able
53:59 - to keep them in sync
54:11 - I mean I guess we could but we're gonna
54:15 - be repeating a lot of a lot of markup so
54:18 - I mean I was just thinking like let's
54:20 - say that we had we had this state exist
54:23 - at each of our views all right which is
54:26 - repetitive and then we had some sort of
54:30 - on click that got passed up up to the
54:40 - parent component right so we had like
54:43 - what the on click handler would live in
54:45 - the parent component and get passed down
54:46 - as a prop right but we'd have to have
54:49 - that same one and every parent component
54:51 - every one of our views so that's not
54:53 - good all right I could clone elements as
54:59 - Photoshop
55:00 - okay so hard should just posted some
55:02 - stuff some code in the live chat so
55:06 - let's see saying react clone element
55:09 - this props children logged in this state
55:13 - look
56:04 - all right so so you're saying that here
56:09 - we could pass props to the children if
56:16 - if that's the case that's actually
56:18 - exactly what we need
56:22 - all right let's try it out so let me go
56:35 - I'm gonna copy this and paste it in here
56:51 - for now let's see layout type and for
57:03 - now I'll just say grid I have a C okay
57:15 - it didn't like that you didn't like this
57:23 - react
57:50 - let me see I just looked up on my other
57:54 - screen one of my other screens how to
57:58 - pass props with this props children or
58:02 - state
58:50 - okay I see need this
59:05 - we're calling element Davis frosty
59:21 - we might need to map over this react
59:39 - all right let's see
59:53 - okay
60:06 - Ishod this okay so from the example that
60:15 - i just saw and stackoverflow they were
60:21 - we're mapping through and and then
60:27 - cloning the element so it said that you
60:29 - have to clone it because of the I guess
60:32 - the the children are immutable so you
60:34 - can't directly do anything and I guess
60:39 - that's not working either I don't think
60:42 - it likes you
60:43 - us using react inside there so if we
60:48 - pull this out let's put it up here
61:01 - and each other
61:10 - okay
61:22 - let's try like that
61:28 - I don't know doesn't want us to put
61:30 - anything in here what is the problem
61:42 - most
62:45 - that's really weird get rid of this
63:04 - that's so weird what why is it not upset
63:09 - about this but it was upset before
63:23 - okay child is not defined no I'm fine
63:34 - 9:36
63:44 - equals
64:00 - hmm
64:05 - I don't know maybe I wonder how old this
64:07 - is saw that oh hello okay harsh it
64:27 - is uh submitting a pull request bulletin
64:36 - me eggs okay not yet are you working on
64:41 - a pull request for that then let me
64:44 - check my time two minutes okay
64:51 - all right so for now
65:28 - I
65:30 - let's try this now
66:46 - the
66:54 - okay Savior says you you wouldn't have
66:59 - that this problem with CSS grids well
67:02 - it's not it's not the layout anymore
67:05 - that's the problem it's it's trying to
67:09 - pass the state I can't believe I'm
67:18 - saying this now but redux would probably
67:21 - make this simpler this because Redux was
67:26 - so hard for me to grasp it was so
67:28 - complex but they're they're probably and
67:38 - I just I know how I would do this in
67:40 - redux
67:46 - alright let's just get rid of this and
67:50 - go back to how it was where it worked
67:54 - and
68:05 - all right
68:07 - okay so here's what I'm gonna do
68:13 - it's Friday I'm not gonna work on this
68:15 - anymore we're gonna come back on Monday
68:20 - now if if anybody wants to submit a pull
68:23 - request to try to fix this
68:27 - that's wonderful if not I think on
68:31 - Monday unless I come up with another
68:33 - idea I think on Monday I'm just going to
68:37 - bring redux back in or figure out a way
68:42 - to access the global store that Apollo
68:45 - is using and add to it and I'm just
68:50 - gonna have this in here because this is
68:52 - a perfect candidate for something that
68:54 - should be in a global store it's
68:56 - something that needs to be accessed by
68:58 - multiple components and it's gonna have
69:00 - to be passed you know down several
69:03 - components so you know that's that's one
69:06 - of the big benefits of Redux is when you
69:08 - have something like that you don't have
69:10 - to keep passing you know things back and
69:14 - forth between you know several levels of
69:18 - components so that's the plan right now
69:23 - at this point I'm gonna go to the live
69:27 - chat I'm gonna check out all the
69:29 - comments and questions answer as many as
69:31 - I can and then then I'm gonna finish up
69:35 - so that I can get out of here and enjoy
69:39 - the weekend although tomorrow I'm
69:42 - probably just gonna code all day so it's
69:43 - not like I'll be doing that much
69:45 - different but I'll get to code all day
69:47 - from a recliner in my basement so much
69:51 - more comfortable okay I'm gonna go back
69:56 - up to where I left off let's let me
70:02 - commit this the that way you all can see
70:04 - everything oops oh you know what I have
70:09 - my my terminal my other screen all right
70:14 - let's bring this in
70:18 - get status
70:21 - all right so we've changed our press
70:25 - preview in a category yep that's what
70:30 - exactly we wanted to change let's see
70:36 - what did we do
71:01 - oops
71:09 - okay all right so everything should be
71:12 - up now on github and okay now let me go
71:19 - to the live chat
71:40 - okay Blake s could you send the link for
71:47 - github styles yeah let me find it
72:04 - you have dark
72:11 - I'm pretty sure this is it I'm gonna
72:13 - paste it in in here and if you're
72:16 - watching this later and can't see the
72:18 - live chat if you just search github dark
72:23 - github dark theme for me it was the very
72:26 - first thing that came up it's a github
72:28 - repo okay John Henson says CSS greed is
72:38 - less code it has a fair learning curve
72:40 - though it's a game changer it is a must
72:42 - learn as it will work on all new
72:44 - browsers very soon
72:46 - I'm gonna have to take the time to learn
72:49 - it here sometime soon Xavier says I
72:53 - agree CSS grids are much easier to work
72:55 - with and many grid systems and the most
72:56 - common frameworks cool ok anna says I
73:03 - enjoy your stream awesome I'm glad that
73:06 - you enjoy it see and it says your
73:14 - English is great I would hope it would
73:17 - be great since I'm I had to take English
73:20 - class every year of my life for the
73:24 - first I don't know since I started
73:28 - school and up until I was 18 I guess
73:38 - Nina says how long have you been coding
73:42 - I started learning how to code when I
73:50 - was a teenager but it was just really
73:53 - basic stuff so I don't even think I'll
73:55 - count that I did a little bit in college
73:58 - with C++ but I didn't really start to
74:05 - code until maybe like five years ago and
74:07 - I would say like really seriously doing
74:11 - JavaScript coding or attempting to do
74:14 - JavaScript coding for about three years
74:16 - now before that the two years before
74:20 - that I did some but a lot of what I did
74:23 - was basic team LCS
74:25 - WordPress theme customization which
74:29 - which is fine and you know I made money
74:32 - doing that and a lot of people make
74:34 - money doing that but you don't really
74:36 - need to use a lot of like more in-depth
74:40 - you know coding with that so so I'd say
74:45 - more realistic measurement is like three
74:48 - years of full-time like dedicated work
74:53 - with coding mainly JavaScript dead
75:02 - zombie says I just want to say how
75:03 - grateful I am for your tutorials I
75:06 - recently started working as a junior
75:08 - front-end dev and watching you helps me
75:11 - so much
75:11 - Oh awesome well congratulations on the
75:14 - job really happy for you and I'm really
75:18 - glad that I could help so awesome I mean
75:21 - that's like exactly why I initially
75:24 - wanted to do this dream is to help out
75:30 - to help out and just show people
75:33 - especially people who were newer just
75:37 - what it's like for what for what I do
75:45 - and see
75:58 - okay in Ashe do you have a mentor sadly
76:04 - I don't really have a mentor I had kind
76:08 - of a mentor so I had a friend and he was
76:10 - actually younger than me but I'd known
76:12 - him since I don't know probably my early
76:17 - teenage years and I was good friends
76:20 - with his older brother and he's the
76:23 - reason that I started actually doing
76:25 - coding for a living I didn't have a job
76:28 - at the time and I had two kids and a
76:31 - wife and I really needed to get a job at
76:34 - make some money and he brought me on
76:37 - with his he had like a media marketing
76:40 - company and he brought me on and
76:43 - basically I did work for him but he paid
76:46 - me to learn you know it was an hourly
76:48 - job and he would say take a couple hours
76:51 - I'll pay you for it and learn how to do
76:54 - this thing or that thing and then he'd
76:56 - give me work based on that so that was
76:57 - really awesome he taught me a lot about
77:00 - contracts and and clients about search
77:03 - engine optimization and different things
77:05 - like that so in terms of like JavaScript
77:08 - coding not necessarily a mentor in that
77:11 - but in just a lot of other things that
77:15 - that happened he was a mentor to me also
77:19 - a really good friend so that's the kind
77:23 - of the closest I've had to a mentor but
77:29 - it'd be cool I mean I've gotten advice
77:31 - from people who have been doing this for
77:33 - a lot longer than me or who are a higher
77:36 - level skill wise than me I wouldn't
77:39 - really say mentorship just you know
77:41 - advice here and there
77:52 - Wow so dead zombie says one guy who's
77:55 - been working for three plus years as a
77:57 - front-end dev has been assigned to me
78:00 - cool so assigned as your mentor just to
78:05 - clarify so I understand that's really
78:07 - cool to be like I said I don't I haven't
78:10 - really had a mentor in terms of coding
78:12 - specifically with with JavaScript but
78:15 - from everything I've read about
78:18 - mentorship and how important it is like
78:20 - it can be a huge help
78:46 - jamjam Euler sorry for mispronouncing
78:49 - that so Jam Euler says do you have any
78:53 - course on Android development sorry for
78:56 - asking something awkward oh no don't
78:58 - don't be sorry at all that's that's
78:59 - definitely not not awkward feel free to
79:02 - ask anything
79:03 - I don't currently have any courses on
79:07 - Android development and I don't think
79:09 - like me personally I don't have it I
79:12 - don't think that free code can't does
79:14 - but I'm not a hundred percent sure if
79:16 - they do it would probably be some sort
79:19 - of video series or potentially like I
79:23 - don't know blog posts about it in the
79:26 - free code camp medium publication so I
79:31 - don't know I would maybe check the
79:32 - playlist on this YouTube channel to see
79:34 - if there's something I am working right
79:37 - now on learning react native which can
79:41 - be used for android development so I
79:43 - really hope to be using some react
79:45 - native stuff on a stream at some point
79:47 - potentially we might turn this project
79:50 - or another one of our projects that
79:53 - we've already done into an Android app
79:56 - in an iOS app with react native so if
80:00 - you can't find something you know right
80:03 - now you know hopefully within the next
80:07 - I don't know month or two maybe I could
80:11 - I could squeeze it in so I don't
80:13 - actually have any official projects or
80:16 - directives from my boss to do an app but
80:19 - I think we could work it in to spend a
80:22 - little bit of time here and they're
80:23 - working on it I think that would be nice
80:25 - that would be the kind of thing that I
80:27 - could just kind of surprise my boss with
80:28 - and say hey I've been messing around
80:30 - with this check it out and I think he
80:33 - would be happy with it
80:35 - at that point when he saw it then he
80:38 - would probably say okay keep working on
80:40 - this and then we could we could do more
80:42 - with it
80:47 - oh so you all heard the vibration when
80:51 - someone was calling on my phone yeah I
80:53 - normally don't answer during the stream
80:55 - unless I think it's really important I
80:58 - think that was just a spam caller though
81:03 - I wouldn't have answered it anyway even
81:06 - if I wasn't streaming
81:15 - okay lucky says it's asking about what
81:20 - the theme is in Visual Studio so yeah
81:23 - Blake said this is Adam so yeah this is
81:25 - Adam and not Visual Studio sometimes I
81:27 - do use Visual Studio but I'm not for
81:29 - this project
81:30 - the theme is SETI so SETI is the theme
81:35 - oh wait a second all right so hard
81:51 - should just pasted some new stuff in
81:54 - okay Murphy or seven
82:05 - hold on a second that's he was going on
82:18 - all right let's check this out quickly
82:25 - okay so this ended up working cool I'll
82:34 - merge this in a second I'm just going to
82:35 - copy and paste it real quick just so
82:37 - that I can show on the stream that it
82:38 - works
82:39 - actually let me alright let's just merge
82:42 - this right now we'll merge there quit
82:46 - like okay so I know I said yesterday
82:48 - normally you'd want to test it out but
82:50 - literally one line has changed right I
82:52 - could see what line that is so we're
82:55 - safe to to merge this in all right now
83:05 - let's pull it in isn't good amazing he
83:13 - just said live collaboration right here
83:15 - on the stream with code being pulled in
83:18 - so that's really cool thanks hardship
83:20 - for the code let's check it out NoHo
83:31 - what is this she like this for you kind
83:33 - of from the files define it that's
83:38 - ridiculous let me reach there at the
83:40 - server because I that shouldn't have
83:42 - anything to do with what we're doing
83:57 - Oh after I just said now I feel silly
84:07 - cuz I just said oh we don't have to
84:09 - worry about it it's just one line what
84:11 - is how you all saw it
84:15 - you you saw the you the code right this
84:24 - was it
84:25 - we a clone element this cross your
84:28 - intestine what all right I'm just going
84:36 - back to the live chat right now
84:51 - all right love you finish in the live
84:54 - chat alright so for now
85:08 - let me just revert yeah let's revert
85:13 - this I just want to make sure that it
85:17 - was this and not something else
85:20 - weirdness happening okay so alright so I
85:36 - have to merge this now right yeah
85:44 - all right our common history is gonna be
85:47 - a little messy
85:51 - all right so let's double check make
85:53 - sure okay yeah it definitely was
85:56 - something all right so anyway we'll
85:59 - figure this out after the stream well
86:01 - not really I figured out on Monday let
86:04 - me finish with the live chat okay okay
86:13 - in ass do you have any trouble with
86:14 - deadlines no not really
86:21 - the deadlines here are not always like
86:25 - strict deadlines so I don't really have
86:28 - a problem so I should say like in terms
86:31 - of the initial deadlines for projects I
86:33 - don't always meet the initial ones but
86:36 - that's because the scope of the project
86:37 - usually changes at some point and
86:41 - because it changes then we change the
86:44 - the launch date accordingly because it's
86:46 - just not realistic anymore
86:47 - also I'm usually waiting on other people
86:50 - for approval for different things so a
86:52 - lot of times I have everything done
86:55 - before it it actually needs to launch
86:59 - but then because I have to wait on more
87:01 - information or different things it
87:04 - doesn't launch on time I mean in that
87:07 - case you know what can I do
87:09 - it's I'm waiting on people that are my
87:12 - superiors to get back to me with the
87:14 - okay that we can launch this so
87:17 - generally though I do launch things on
87:19 - time so it hasn't been an issue there's
87:24 - never been a time where you know I've
87:26 - been reprimanded for not making a
87:28 - deadline usually it's been the opposite
87:32 - and and people have been pleasantly
87:34 - surprised at how quickly I can get
87:36 - things done so not all the time but a
87:41 - lot of times so luckily is that I'm
87:44 - getting a lot better at correctly
87:46 - estimating how long things will take
87:48 - it's taken me a long time to get to that
87:50 - point when I can estimate correctly but
87:53 - I would say if you're giving an estimate
87:55 - of how long something should take always
87:57 - over s
87:57 - to make things complications always
88:00 - arise in projects so very rarely where
88:04 - everything go perfectly according to
88:05 - plan so factor that into your time if if
88:07 - you need to give time estimates you know
88:12 - definitely definitely give yourself some
88:17 - allowance for that unexpected element
88:19 - that always seems to happen all right
88:28 - Blake says I have my portfolio running
88:31 - off a github repo with pages running but
88:35 - I want to run it off of the username
88:37 - repo what is the best way to do it
88:51 - okay it looks like rook already answered
88:54 - and says basically create a repo with
88:56 - your your username github io as the name
89:00 - and enable pages okay cool
89:04 - I didn't realize you could do that so
89:06 - thanks thanks rope for that answer
89:18 - Harshit says what plans about the server
89:20 - how will you protect the wordpress api
89:24 - it still returns to four or three yeah
89:27 - it does still return a four or three I'm
89:29 - not sure if that's something to do with
89:31 - the plug-in so probably when we get
89:37 - closer to the time when this will
89:38 - actually launch I'll worry more about it
89:40 - if it's still we're turning the 403 but
89:42 - until that time I'm just going to
89:43 - continue to upgrade the plug-in when new
89:45 - upgrades come out and because I think
89:47 - they're aware of the problem I do need
89:49 - to double check in the slack Channel but
89:55 - I'm pretty sure someone's already
89:56 - reported the issue it might be reported
89:59 - on github as well so I think it's being
90:02 - worked on and this project the WP graph
90:06 - QL plug-in project seems to be pretty
90:09 - active there's always activity on the
90:12 - slack Channel at least every day so I'm
90:16 - that it probably should be fixed I would
90:19 - think before we're ready to launch in
90:21 - terms of the server we do need to figure
90:24 - something out about WordPress so I don't
90:26 - know if if you've realized this or not
90:28 - yet but potentially right if we want
90:32 - this to be a login only site so we don't
90:37 - want anybody to be able to see this
90:39 - except users who can log in that's fine
90:42 - but what if somebody knows how to use
90:44 - the WordPress API or graph QL and
90:48 - decides they're going to try to pull
90:50 - data from our WordPress installation now
90:52 - normally that would be a very kind of
90:56 - remote possibility right because we
91:01 - could certainly not advertise the URL at
91:07 - all we can make if some crazy long URL
91:09 - that no one would ever guess try to hide
91:11 - it like that but potentially someone
91:16 - could still get it there's still a
91:17 - chance so it's it's not enough to just
91:20 - have our react portion of this password
91:24 - protected we have to have some way to
91:26 - protect it from the WordPress end so
91:29 - that's something we're going to have to
91:30 - think
91:30 - about I think we have multiple options
91:35 - on how to do that so we will get to that
91:39 - at some point I'm still not hundred
91:43 - percent sure how I want to do it though
91:44 - so if anyone has any ideas about that
91:48 - let me know we'll talk about it in an
91:52 - upcoming stream or like I said I do have
91:57 - some ideas I just kind of need to test
91:59 - them out and see if they'll work with
92:02 - with the graph QL plugin that we're
92:06 - using world says what's the advantage of
92:17 - using material UI instead of some other
92:18 - framework like flex box or bootstrap for
92:27 - material UI they have react components
92:29 - built in so that's a huge advantage if
92:33 - you're using reacts otherwise so some
92:39 - frameworks rely on jQuery to do some
92:42 - things and or or not or potentially
92:45 - vanilla JavaScript but either way you're
92:47 - not really supposed to manipulate the
92:49 - Dom through other means all Dom
92:52 - manipulations should be done the react
92:55 - way within your components otherwise it
92:58 - messes up Reax ability to have an
93:01 - accurate picture of the state of the Dom
93:03 - at all times so it's better to use a
93:08 - framework that is made for react and
93:11 - works within those constraints then you
93:13 - use another one it's not impossible
93:14 - though if you check out project one we
93:17 - used a just a regular non react
93:20 - framework materialized CSS that's very
93:22 - similar to bootstrap and we made it work
93:27 - with react it worked I mean the site's
93:32 - functional it's been live for a couple
93:34 - of months now
93:36 - we've had no problems with it so it's
93:39 - just better to do everything right the
93:42 - react way Oh her shirt says tell me I
93:47 - will work on it this weekend I'm not
93:56 - sure at what point what I was talking
93:57 - about when you made that comment so
93:59 - harsh it let me know what what in
94:02 - particular were you saying that you
94:04 - would work on I mean there's definitely
94:09 - definitely love to work on still and if
94:12 - you're willing to work on it this
94:12 - weekend that would be amazing
94:21 - Eric's Eric asks how hard is it to learn
94:24 - react from using angularjs let's see I I
94:37 - don't know that I'm the best to answer
94:39 - this because I knew it allure before I
94:43 - started using react but I was not an
94:46 - experienced angular developer you know
94:48 - by by any means at all I just kind of
94:50 - messed around with it on side projects
94:52 - and wasn't very successful so if you
94:58 - know angular I don't think it'd be that
95:00 - hard for you to figure out react but
95:02 - they are different so you won't be able
95:06 - to just come straight over and say okay
95:09 - this in angular equals this thing and
95:12 - react exactly right so it's a little bit
95:14 - different mindset but if someone has the
95:16 - skills to be able to learn angular I
95:18 - have no doubt that they also have the
95:20 - skills to be able to learn react so I
95:23 - wouldn't worry too much about it if you
95:25 - were trying to make the switch but I
95:31 - would say like just be open to thinking
95:36 - about things differently with react than
95:40 - you did with angular so like don't think
95:42 - there's going to be like I said those
95:44 - exact correspondence to the way you do
95:48 - things are
95:49 - things work so but I don't think someone
95:53 - who knows angular would have any issues
95:54 - and learning react let's see so you sick
96:01 - I'm not sure I pronounce this Sokka sick
96:07 - soch I si si so anyway says hello from
96:11 - Russia thanks for your streams hey
96:14 - welcome and how's it going in Russia
96:21 - thank thanks for saying that you're
96:24 - welcome I'm glad that you're you're
96:25 - watching the stream and that you joined
96:29 - us here in the live chat
97:06 - oh cool okay Anna says thank you for
97:09 - your stream have a good day and weekend
97:12 - oh you welcome thanks for watching being
97:15 - a live chat and you have a great weekend
97:17 - as well oh okay okay so hard she was
97:23 - talking about the plugin yeah so
97:29 - syndication
97:44 - okay so hard is commenting a little
97:47 - bit about this authentication and our WP
97:51 - graph he'll plug in so hard says my
97:56 - idea is to screw up the plug-in and
97:58 - write our custom graph QL query this way
98:02 - we will use authentication on the server
98:04 - like like a loss 2.0 plug-in okay
98:13 - I'm open I'm open to it
98:20 - Xavier asked Jesse what is it you want
98:24 - to try to do with your grid layout I
98:26 - kind of want to give it a shot with CSS
98:28 - grids over the weekend okay so basically
98:30 - I want to I guess I can show you on this
98:40 - other site let's see this will probably
98:46 - the easiest way to just show you
98:56 - okay so here's the current bulletin this
99:00 - is the default view right which looks
99:02 - pretty much like the default view we
99:04 - have now and then when you click on this
99:05 - icon for grid view it goes like this
99:08 - and then you can go back to what I'm
99:11 - calling list view and of course it's
99:15 - responsive so even if you were in good
99:17 - view and you went down to mobile size it
99:19 - would only take up one you know one
99:22 - column so as you get smaller you have
99:24 - less columns so that's that's basically
99:26 - what I'm trying to accomplish that we
99:29 - can click a button and have the view
99:31 - switch
99:45 - all right awesome
99:49 - okay JV or says challenge accepted how
99:52 - hi cool
99:56 - that's it I'm at the bottom of the live
99:58 - chat so it's after 4:00 p.m. on a Friday
100:06 - almost time for me to get out of here
100:09 - so thank you so much for watching for
100:14 - joining the live chat for helping me
100:16 - thanks for the pool requests this was a
100:19 - really nice stream I liked it we didn't
100:23 - get that much done but we talked about a
100:26 - lot of issues that we're gonna face in
100:28 - the future and we have some ideas so I
100:31 - like that we're on a good track here and
100:34 - some new people today in the live chat
100:37 - so that's always awesome I enjoy meeting
100:40 - you virtually here so I'll be back
100:45 - Monday and until then have a great
100:49 - weekend
