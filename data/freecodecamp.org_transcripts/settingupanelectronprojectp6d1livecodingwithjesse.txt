00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse
00:10 - i'm jesse
00:11 - today we're going to do something new
00:13 - that we've never done on the stream and
00:14 - something that i've never done
00:17 - we are going to start building
00:20 - an electron app
00:23 - so
00:24 - if you're not familiar with electron
00:27 - i'll take a minute here and explain to
00:29 - the best of my ability what electron is
00:32 - so
00:34 - electron was developed by github
00:36 - specifically to build atom their editor
00:40 - but now it's been used for a lot of
00:41 - other things so if you ever use the
00:44 - slack desktop app or visual studio code
00:47 - and there's a lot of other things
00:49 - get cracking
00:52 - so
00:54 - it's it's a way to use html css and
00:57 - javascript
00:58 - to build
01:00 - applications that run on the desktop
01:03 - so
01:04 - they run
01:05 - like native applications native desktop
01:08 - applications
01:10 - and a lot of most people can't tell the
01:12 - difference
01:14 - so
01:16 - we're going to use that we're going to
01:17 - take in a project that we've already
01:19 - done in react which is the resource
01:22 - center
01:24 - and we're going to make a
01:26 - desktop
01:28 - app version of it
01:30 - so we're still going to use react
01:32 - uh we'll probably use create react app
01:35 - and then but we're also going to use
01:36 - electron with it
01:38 - so since i've never set up a project
01:40 - like this before i'm not sure how long
01:42 - it'll take we're going to try to get as
01:43 - much done as we can today i do have a
01:46 - meeting at three
01:48 - so that's
01:50 - um so it's 1 30 my time
01:54 - so in less than an hour and a half
01:56 - because it's a little after 1 30. i have
01:58 - to be at a meeting so i'm thinking maybe
02:00 - two pomodoro sessions
02:03 - and then questions after
02:06 - so
02:08 - that's the uh that's the plan today
02:11 - i'm let me show you
02:13 - what i'm using so let me switch up here
02:16 - so i can see what i see
02:19 - all right so this is the article that i
02:21 - found that i'm going to use now if
02:23 - anybody has used electron before
02:25 - specifically electron with react
02:28 - let me know if there's some better way
02:31 - to do this that you know of otherwise i
02:33 - mean i've spent not a really long amount
02:36 - of time but i spent a little while
02:38 - checking out different articles and
02:41 - different github repos on ways to start
02:43 - up your project with react and electron
02:46 - so
02:47 - this is what i found this article from
02:50 - react to an electron app ready for
02:52 - production and it has this awesome
02:54 - picture check that out i want that as a
02:56 - sticker
02:57 - on a laptop
03:00 - that would be sweet
03:02 - um
03:03 - is there some company where i can just
03:04 - send a picture into and they'll print me
03:06 - out a laptop sticker
03:08 - there's got to be something like that
03:10 - out there
03:11 - but uh
03:12 - that's a cool one
03:14 - anyway
03:15 - i don't know who drew this i don't want
03:16 - to just steal it off to
03:19 - ask permission i guess see who who made
03:22 - that anyway
03:24 - enough of the sticker stuff so i'm going
03:26 - to pull this off the screen
03:28 - and then so i'll have more room to work
03:30 - with at first we'll just be working in
03:32 - the
03:34 - in the terminal here
03:35 - and then we'll switch over to our code
03:37 - editor at some point assuming we get far
03:39 - enough to to do that
03:42 - um so these instructions came out
03:44 - june 13th of this year so they're not
03:47 - really really up to date but
03:49 - um
03:50 - i think they should they should work
03:53 - um i was looking through it they are you
03:55 - know they're using
03:59 - it seems like pretty up-to-date stuff i
04:01 - know you know we've had a major react
04:04 - you know update with version 16.
04:07 - um but we're gonna give it a shot
04:10 - and as long as it's still early on in
04:12 - the project if we find out like today or
04:16 - you know maybe the next day or something
04:17 - that hey there's some better way to do
04:19 - it then
04:21 - we haven't lost very much time we'll
04:22 - just wish to that
04:24 - okay i'm sure if you've watched before
04:26 - you've all seen me totally switch up a
04:29 - project
04:31 - even a week or two weeks in
04:33 - um
04:34 - all right awesome so we got decent
04:36 - number of viewers hey everybody uh
04:39 - especially if if you haven't joined
04:41 - before i'm about to start doing some
04:43 - coding
04:44 - and during that time i'm not really
04:46 - going to look at the live chat much so
04:47 - if you ask a question just hang on for a
04:49 - little bit
04:50 - after 25 minute period is up which i'm
04:52 - going to start a timer right now for
04:54 - that so after this 25 minute period is
04:56 - up i'll go back to the live chat read
04:58 - through as much as i can answer as many
05:00 - questions as i can then i'm going to do
05:02 - another 25 minute session of coding and
05:04 - then at the end of that i'll answer all
05:05 - your questions
05:08 - unless i get a lot of questions because
05:10 - i i do have to get my meeting but
05:12 - usually i can answer all the questions
05:15 - so let's get started
05:17 - let me make this a bit bigger i want to
05:19 - make sure everybody can
05:21 - see
05:23 - um also we did get some pull requests
05:27 - so
05:29 - we got a lot of pull requests that i
05:30 - merged
05:32 - maybe if we have time later on i'll go
05:34 - through what happened because there were
05:36 - several projects that i got pull
05:38 - requests so
05:40 - um i'll catch
05:43 - i'll try to catch you all up on on what
05:45 - went on if i don't have time today then
05:46 - we'll just catch up tomorrow
05:49 - all right so
05:51 - first things first let's go into our my
05:53 - projects folder so i'm going to cd
05:55 - projects
05:57 - all right now
06:00 - we're just going to do a simple create
06:02 - react app right we've done this before
06:04 - so let's use create react app
06:13 - and
06:15 - let's do
06:17 - what should we call this um
06:20 - let's stick with
06:24 - let's go with rc electron so the
06:27 - resource center electron so we know what
06:29 - we're using
06:30 - and
06:32 - let's see
06:35 - yeah that's that's all we should need so
06:37 - this when i hit enter
06:39 - um it should create a folder for us
06:41 - called rc electron
06:44 - and then within that folder it's going
06:46 - to give us everything we need to have a
06:48 - react app and in fact it will be a
06:50 - working react app
06:53 - but we can't stop there because we
06:54 - wanted to also
06:56 - work on a desktop
06:58 - with electron
06:59 - so as soon as this is finished we're
07:02 - also going to add electron okay so you
07:05 - can see when you fin if you haven't used
07:06 - this before it's kind of nice when it
07:08 - finishes
07:09 - it tells you
07:10 - exactly what was created and where it's
07:13 - at
07:14 - tells you commands to get started
07:17 - you'll be using start the most
07:20 - out of any of these you may never use
07:21 - eject
07:23 - and then even get let you
07:25 - tells you right away just type these two
07:27 - things and you'll be good so first thing
07:30 - we're going to do
07:31 - is what it says
07:33 - we're going to do rc electron so now
07:35 - we're in that folder
07:37 - if i um
07:38 - show all the files you can see we
07:40 - already have a readme package.json
07:43 - got a node module so we have
07:46 - every like i said everything we need for
07:48 - react app
07:50 - so now let's do the electron part
07:52 - i'm going to copy and paste
07:55 - because it's a a lot and i don't want to
07:57 - mess it up so i'm going to copy and
07:59 - paste and then we'll go through it so
08:00 - we're going to do a yarn add
08:03 - right so if you use npm you can do npm
08:06 - install and it'll do the same thing
08:08 - so we're installing we're adding the um
08:12 - npm packages for electron we're going to
08:15 - use the electron builder which this will
08:17 - help us whenever we actually want to
08:18 - make this a
08:20 - an app that can run
08:22 - natively
08:23 - we're going to get weight on and
08:25 - concurrently
08:26 - and then we're saving these as uh dev
08:29 - dependencies
08:31 - so you'll see uh what we're getting
08:33 - these for in a minute that's gonna help
08:35 - with um
08:37 - like our scripts
08:39 - let's see so let's hit enter
08:41 - i have a lot to
08:44 - install hopefully doesn't take too long
08:59 - all right well that's going i'll check
09:01 - the live chat whoops it already worked
09:03 - awesome so i don't think we got any
09:06 - errors
09:07 - awesome uh now we need to add one more
09:09 - thing um yarn out electron
09:12 - is dev
09:13 - i honestly have no idea what this thing
09:15 - does but it says to download it in a
09:17 - tutorial and i did not even see it
09:20 - mentioned when i read through the
09:21 - tutorial which
09:23 - i admit i didn't read every word of this
09:26 - so
09:27 - i expect that i'm going to mess up at
09:29 - some point during this at least once so
09:31 - just fair warning to everybody
09:34 - but that's kind of what this stream's
09:36 - all about i mean we do want to make cool
09:38 - stuff uh and then hopefully we all learn
09:40 - something but
09:42 - i mean really like the stream is so you
09:45 - all can see me mess up right and then
09:47 - try to get out of it together
09:51 - okay
09:55 - awesome we have everything cool we need
09:57 - to add an electron
10:00 - dot js file
10:06 - so that
10:08 - electron works with create react app so
10:11 - you'll be able to see what this file is
10:12 - in a minute
10:13 - let's um
10:15 - i'll tell you what let's do this
10:20 - i talked to i know a lot of you have
10:22 - been recommending visual studio code and
10:24 - i talked to some people
10:26 - at that november at the conference and
10:29 - they were saying you know some of them
10:31 - had switched from adam to visual studio
10:33 - code and they're saying how much they
10:34 - like it so
10:36 - i went ahead and i
10:40 - i downloaded some
10:42 - react
10:43 - plug-ins for visual studio code
10:46 - and i haven't tested them out yet
10:49 - but i think
10:50 - it would be cool
10:52 - to try to do this project in visual
10:54 - studio code
10:56 - let me pull it over here first
10:58 - so
11:02 - let's go
11:03 - with
11:05 - let's open this project
11:11 - i folded a workspace
11:17 - and
11:19 - where we have projects
11:21 - and then here's our rc electron project
11:24 - let's add it
11:25 - awesome
11:31 - so let's go in our public folder and we
11:34 - want to add
11:38 - let's make this big
11:40 - there we go and then i can
11:43 - increase the font size
11:46 - great
11:51 - all right so now hopefully y'all can see
11:54 - and i'm going to add a new file
11:57 - and we're going to call this file
12:01 - electron.js
12:09 - and then i'm going to paste this in so
12:12 - let's check this out i haven't even
12:14 - looked at this file yet let's look at it
12:15 - a bit and see what
12:17 - uh what's going on here so one of the
12:22 - plugins that i downloaded
12:25 - comes with
12:26 - this this stuff so it tells me how big
12:29 - all these things i'm importing are which
12:32 - i think is really cool
12:35 - probably won't really
12:37 - make a difference
12:38 - unless you know we import something and
12:40 - it's like
12:42 - huge and then maybe we might think about
12:44 - trying to use something else
12:46 - but i thought it was pretty cool
12:48 - actually used a thing called what was it
12:50 - called uh
12:53 - food truck
12:54 - react food truck
12:56 - so you just pull you get the plug-in
12:59 - called react food truck
13:02 - and then it installs a bunch of other
13:04 - react plug-ins i'm not going to go
13:05 - through them all now but they all seem
13:08 - super helpful
13:09 - so that's where i got most of these
13:11 - plug-ins that i'm using
13:13 - so if anyone's interested in that if you
13:15 - want more info i can i guess i'll just
13:19 - send a link right now
13:22 - let me put the link in the live chat
13:24 - right now so you all can check that out
13:25 - if you want
13:29 - there we go so it's in there now
13:31 - all right so let's let's go through this
13:34 - and
13:36 - make this one here we go
13:40 - let me know if you can't see if the font
13:42 - is too small
13:46 - so
13:49 - well i just glanced at the live chat and
13:51 - it is harsh it's birthday
13:53 - happy birthday
13:56 - so harsh you're 16 now
14:00 - right
14:01 - let me know if i'm wrong
14:04 - but
14:05 - oh no the link's a 404 page
14:09 - no let me see
14:15 - why is it a 404 page
14:19 - let me get rid of all that junk at the
14:21 - end of the link and see if it still
14:22 - works no it doesn't
14:26 - um
14:30 - all right
14:31 - here i'm just going to paste the title
14:34 - in here if you try to google that title
14:37 - then
14:38 - i'm hoping it'll come up i don't know
14:40 - what's going on with the link it works
14:42 - it works on my machine right
14:46 - i hate saying that
14:48 - but in this case it's true
14:50 - um all right so
14:54 - so we're bringing in electron obviously
14:57 - um
14:59 - electron.app
15:01 - browser window
15:04 - also so if you don't know
15:07 - i guess electron does what it does
15:09 - because it's built on top of
15:11 - chromium which is like
15:13 - um
15:15 - i guess like the core code of chrome the
15:18 - chrome browser something like that i'm
15:20 - not really an expert on all how that
15:22 - works but
15:23 - you can make a javascript css html
15:28 - app
15:29 - and then it runs on chromium
15:32 - but it runs in such a way that it looks
15:35 - and behaves like a native app like you
15:37 - you can have access to like the file
15:39 - structure and things like that
15:41 - uh i believe okay so like i said not the
15:44 - expert first time i'm working with it
15:46 - but i'm
15:47 - that's
15:48 - at least kind of big picture how it
15:50 - works so
15:52 - not only you know do you get the app but
15:54 - you also get chromium bundled with it
15:56 - which is basically the reason why i want
15:58 - to do this because then we i do not have
16:00 - to deal with
16:03 - outdated browsers and issues with that
16:05 - because we've had a really big problem
16:09 - with computers on campus here at the
16:11 - university i work for having
16:13 - very outdated versions of browsers like
16:15 - i'm talking about browsers that came out
16:16 - in 2007 right
16:19 - so we don't have to worry about this at
16:21 - all
16:22 - and i
16:24 - i came up with this idea at november
16:27 - talking with someone who actually works
16:30 - on the electron project they work for
16:32 - github
16:34 - um
16:37 - sharon
16:38 - i can't remember her last name but
16:39 - anyway she was one of the speakers at
16:41 - november so if you check out the
16:43 - november site and the speakers i'm
16:45 - pretty sure she's the only speaker named
16:46 - sharon and she's from github
16:49 - so uh anyway
16:52 - so
16:53 - based on what she was saying about
16:55 - electron it just occurred to me wait
16:56 - that could solve a lot of our problems
16:59 - so anyway
17:00 - that's why i thought we should do it and
17:02 - it'd be cool to learn how to do this
17:05 - um
17:06 - okay so anyway
17:12 - okay cool so it looks like this is just
17:14 - kind of setting up electron and setting
17:16 - up everything to run so
17:19 - great
17:20 - um
17:22 - let's move on
17:33 - all right so let's go to our
17:34 - package.json
17:37 - and we need to configure that
17:40 - to actually know where this file is
17:42 - right and use it
17:44 - so here we go package.json
17:48 - great
17:49 - all right so
17:52 - we're gonna add
17:54 - actually i should
17:56 - i think there's a completed repo
18:02 - of this there we go there is an example
18:04 - repo which is going to be super helpful
18:06 - you know how in
18:09 - when you're using a tutorial they just
18:10 - give you tiny snippets and it's not
18:12 - always that obvious where the snippets
18:14 - are supposed to go
18:16 - uh so
18:18 - i am going to
18:19 - also have the
18:21 - repo open
18:24 - at the same time
18:26 - so i could see like the final picture
18:29 - and
18:32 - what's going on with that
18:35 - okay cool
18:39 - so
18:40 - let's put in
18:42 - main
18:43 - oops
18:46 - main
18:46 - and then
18:48 - public
18:54 - public electron.js so that just tells it
18:57 - where that file is
18:59 - okay and
19:11 - so now we're going to add a script
19:20 - whoops
19:22 - sorry i'd scroll down too far i'm not
19:25 - there yet
19:27 - um
19:30 - we're still going to add a script though
19:31 - i'm going to copy and paste this because
19:33 - this is long and complicated
19:36 - so let's see
19:43 - in our
19:44 - scripts
19:46 - here we are
19:47 - in our scripts i'm going to add this
19:50 - after eject
19:52 - we could put it anywhere but i'm gonna
19:54 - add it there
19:55 - and
19:57 - if you see we have this big string and
20:01 - then
20:04 - we should be able to run after we do
20:06 - this so let me save this
20:08 - and
20:12 - let's run it let's run this script and
20:14 - see what happens
20:16 - we're not finished setting it up yet but
20:23 - this is good for dev at least
20:26 - it should be
20:27 - all right so would we just call that
20:28 - script
20:30 - electron dev
20:33 - all right so
20:35 - yarn
20:38 - electron
20:39 - dev
20:44 - all right
20:45 - no errors so far
20:48 - oh something's already running on 43 000
20:50 - no
20:51 - what i have running
20:53 - i have way too many terminal uh tabs
20:56 - open
20:57 - all right
21:01 - all right let me turn this off
21:09 - oh okay i got it i got it it was our um
21:14 - it was our next uh app that we're
21:16 - building for that main site all right so
21:18 - let's let's try it now
21:20 - um
21:23 - there we go
21:36 - yeah
21:38 - cool and it runs it on the network too
21:42 - very cool um
21:44 - let me do this and then also
21:47 - let me run it on uh on ngrok and see
21:52 - see what that's like
22:07 - all right check it out
22:11 - we have a react app running
22:14 - on localhost
22:17 - let me put this i got my android
22:20 - going
22:23 - on another window here
22:26 - let me paste in
22:29 - the url
22:36 - alright so if anybody wants to check it
22:37 - out
22:40 - uh there's the link in the live chat and
22:42 - grock lets you all um inspect this
22:47 - and
22:49 - let's see
22:52 - yeah where did the window go
22:59 - and i have it running in the browser but
23:01 - it's not running
23:05 - it's not running like you a normal
23:07 - electron app would run
23:09 - so
23:12 - i'm trying to check out my windows here
23:14 - and see where
23:16 - it popped up
23:23 - where are you
23:38 - so i have an electron
23:40 - icon
23:44 - here you may not be able to see it
23:48 - it's probably underneath all right so
23:50 - you might you can barely see it right
23:52 - there in the
23:53 - uh bottom right hand corner
23:57 - but why is it not showing me anything
24:00 - all right let's move around a bit and
24:02 - see
24:03 - no
24:04 - no
24:09 - yeah
24:11 - let's move that over here
24:13 - while we're while we're here let's move
24:15 - this over
24:18 - okay
24:19 - um
24:23 - let me before i
24:25 - keep searching let's just read this
24:27 - output and see if it says anything
24:29 - um
25:03 - all right so
25:06 - i don't see anything in the
25:11 - hmm
25:13 - sorry i don't see anything in the
25:15 - tutorial that we're following
25:18 - that we did wrong
25:22 - trying to scroll back up yeah it looks
25:24 - like
25:25 - everything was fine
25:29 - so
25:32 - i guess we could just try it again
25:37 - let's do that
25:39 - let's try it again
25:41 - and
25:43 - let me make sure i'm not running
25:45 - anything else
25:48 - i don't think i am
25:49 - okay
25:52 - and
25:55 - oops let's see here
25:58 - um i'm gonna exit this out too i highly
26:01 - doubt that's affecting it but that was
26:03 - our um
26:05 - our app we our react native app i have
26:08 - it running on expo
26:12 - all right so let's get out of this
26:20 - let's try it again
26:23 - that's weird there we go
26:33 - oh let me check the live chat just see
26:34 - if anybody has any
26:36 - ideas um
26:42 - i see michael's idea have you tried
26:43 - turning it off and back on again that's
26:45 - a good idea
26:49 - where
26:54 - all right so
26:58 - hmm
27:07 - why is it showing sound coming from my
27:09 - react native debugger that's weird
27:11 - let's
27:12 - get out of there
27:14 - okay
27:15 - actually i didn't check on this screen
27:17 - let me check on this screen just in case
27:19 - no nothing
27:21 - hmm
27:25 - all right let me
27:27 - i'm gonna quit the electron um
27:30 - that was open in the bottom and then try
27:33 - this again
27:34 - see if it makes a difference
27:39 - i knew something would go wrong when
27:40 - we're setting this up
27:43 - let me check the live chat again
27:45 - check my time
27:46 - all right so in about two minutes i'm
27:48 - gonna go over the live chat and try to
27:49 - read through all your comments and
27:51 - questions
28:08 - okay that's interesting so i am getting
28:11 - the
28:12 - electron coming back up in
28:22 - um electrons coming back up
28:26 - in my my task bar
28:28 - or whatever it's called at the bottom of
28:30 - the mag
28:31 - window
29:07 - really uh okay it looks like
29:19 - all right here's the link okay so
29:20 - harshit has a link to
29:23 - the quick start guide
29:33 - let's check this out
29:38 - no i'm again a 404.
30:19 - all right so let
30:20 - me let's do the break okay and let me go
30:24 - to the live chat so if you're asking
30:25 - questions i'm going to try to get to
30:26 - them right now
30:28 - i'm going to scroll up a bit
30:31 - and
30:34 - oh cool i was asking about making a
30:37 - sticker and brian said sticker mule all
30:39 - right i have to check that out thank you
30:47 - okay
30:48 - um
30:50 - michael was asking about like what's
30:52 - going on with this project what project
30:54 - is it so yeah it's we're just gonna take
30:56 - the resource center that we've already
30:58 - built and react and we're going to make
31:01 - it
31:02 - uh an electron version of it
31:05 - so
31:06 - we're still gonna have that resource
31:08 - center site
31:09 - available for the browser but we're also
31:12 - gonna have
31:14 - a mobile app
31:16 - and we're gonna have a desktop app
31:39 - oh okay so yarn said
31:42 - i tried to give you all a link earlier
31:44 - to a visual studio code package and it
31:46 - didn't work but yarn said
31:49 - that
31:50 - if you google it and then click the link
31:53 - it's the same link but it doesn't give
31:55 - the 404 error so i know isn't that
31:58 - that's weird like
31:59 - it it works anyway
32:01 - uh-huh so i guess it will work if you
32:04 - google it
32:06 - i should ask if i've checked polyfill.io
32:08 - i did check that out harshit i just
32:10 - didn't have time
32:12 - uh to actually get it
32:15 - to put it on that project and test it
32:17 - out so
32:18 - um
32:19 - i will get to that at some point
32:25 - sorry
32:28 - um
32:36 - brian says still using netscape
32:38 - navigator is there a better browser
32:41 - yeah i mean what
32:42 - why did we ever need anything else
32:44 - besides netscape navigator
32:50 - [Music]
32:51 - john b says you should update the ie6
32:54 - it's the best
32:56 - michael says you're going to use visual
32:59 - visual studio instead of atom for a
33:01 - project based on chromium interesting
33:03 - actually visual studio code is also
33:05 - based
33:07 - on on chromium so they're both electron
33:11 - apps which is interesting because i've
33:13 - heard people complain about atom and
33:16 - atom is so slow and electron is so slow
33:19 - but then you have visual studio code
33:20 - that people say so fast and it also runs
33:24 - on electron
33:25 - right
33:26 - so i don't think the problem is electron
33:28 - it's probably just how you use electron
33:32 - right
33:32 - and since atom was like one of the i
33:35 - think the first
33:37 - electron
33:38 - app
33:40 - maybe
33:41 - there's some legacy stuff for
33:43 - optimizations that it's just still there
33:46 - visual studio code's a lot newer
33:48 - i don't know i don't really know but
33:49 - that'd be my guess to explain the
33:51 - difference
33:56 - brian says john b do you have a set of
33:58 - floppies for ie6 you could send me
34:06 - see
34:20 - let's see
34:25 - all right steve stevie came in and says
34:28 - um why why electron
34:31 - um
34:33 - i want to use electron
34:35 - the idea is basically if i use electron
34:38 - then the people who will download this
34:40 - app i don't have to worry about their
34:43 - versions of their browser right because
34:45 - they're going to have chromium
34:47 - installed with this so
34:49 - uh
34:50 - i'll just get around all the problems
34:52 - that i've been having with
34:54 - people using really really old browsers
35:02 - uh gander7 asks which tutorial are you
35:05 - following i'm gonna throw this up on the
35:06 - screen now
35:07 - uh i'm using this tutorial
35:10 - from react to an electron app ready for
35:13 - production i guess i can paste this in
35:16 - as well if you all want to see it
35:20 - and
35:23 - stephen also asked just for some context
35:25 - on the video is this the first time
35:27 - you're using electron yes definitely the
35:30 - first time
35:32 - um
35:33 - michael says i'm confused what is is not
35:36 - happening okay so
35:38 - base let me let me scroll down and show
35:40 - you what's supposed to happen is i'm
35:41 - supposed to get a window like this
35:44 - so it's supposed to look like
35:47 - a native app and not a browser window so
35:50 - i can open this in a browser window
35:52 - which is awesome but it's not really any
35:54 - different than you know whatever we've
35:55 - done in the past with react what we
35:58 - wanted to see was this browser window
36:00 - pop up automatically so what we do have
36:04 - is that electron starts
36:06 - which is good we can see it
36:08 - here
36:10 - in the bottom right hand corner there
36:12 - that's electron that's the electron that
36:14 - we have uh loaded into our node modules
36:17 - but
36:19 - there's no window coming up
36:23 - so we've got to figure out why that is
36:29 - all right and didn't quite get through
36:31 - everything so i'm gonna make a note of
36:33 - where i'm stopping and then come back to
36:36 - it after our next 25 minute coding
36:38 - session
36:50 - okay
36:52 - and i'm going to scan quickly to see
36:54 - what you are saying about our specific
36:56 - problem here
37:19 - on the link i just pasted it looks like
37:21 - it's a 404 as well what is up with
37:24 - both of those links were from medium i
37:26 - think
37:27 - i don't know what's going on with that
37:29 - um i guess
37:31 - you can try to search then
37:34 - from react to an electron app ready for
37:36 - production i guess it's probably the
37:38 - same problem we had before
37:47 - all right
37:55 - so let me
37:56 - i'm gonna get several different
37:58 - suggestions it looks like so let me
38:04 - let me see
38:11 - local dependencies
38:17 - all right let's try
38:18 - it looks like rook has something that's
38:21 - we can try uh very easily to see if
38:24 - it'll work so
38:26 - um let's do this
38:44 - all right so that's where the shot
38:46 - because it's just
38:48 - such a simple fix if it works
38:50 - so let me
38:53 - close that out and then i want to make
38:55 - sure okay so that electron's gone from
38:58 - the taskbar that's good
39:00 - now let's start it up again
39:03 - see what happens this time
39:08 - so if this works it'll be awesome
39:09 - otherwise i'll go to some of the other
39:11 - suggestions that you'll have in there i
39:13 - always like to try the easiest thing
39:15 - first
39:17 - it doesn't always work but if it does
39:19 - then you save a ton of time
39:26 - okay so this is opening again
39:28 - and we still have
39:31 - no looks like nothing
39:35 - let me check my other screens just to be
39:38 - sure
39:39 - and
39:40 - i don't see anything
39:46 - yep
39:48 - not seeing anything okay well that was
39:50 - worth a shot
39:53 - let's um
39:55 - let me just remove that
39:57 - before i forget so we're
39:59 - have the same thing
40:01 - let me i'm going to check
40:03 - so the tutorial came with a repository a
40:07 - github repository so here's the finished
40:10 - package.json from
40:12 - that repository so maybe there's
40:14 - something in here
40:16 - that didn't get put in
40:20 - um in the tutorial
40:23 - or got maybe updated afterwards
40:25 - so let's compare here i'm gonna move i'm
40:28 - actually gonna move this on my other
40:29 - screen so i can compare it with what i
40:30 - have
40:32 - um
40:48 - interesting
41:02 - react
41:09 - so
41:32 - hmm
41:54 - okay
41:56 - it doesn't there's a bunch of other
41:57 - stuff in this
41:59 - package json so um
42:02 - let me copy and paste that link as well
42:04 - hopefully this one will work
42:09 - there's other stuff in here from later
42:11 - on the tutorial and that's
42:13 - basically for when we want to package
42:15 - this up
42:16 - when we're finished with it
42:18 - so we don't need it now but it looks
42:20 - like of the things that that we've done
42:23 - so far that we needed
42:26 - it's all
42:27 - fine it's the only differences are
42:29 - versions
42:30 - so there are some differences in the
42:32 - versions that we're using
42:36 - um
42:38 - it's possible that that
42:40 - that's the problem i was a little
42:41 - worried about this because the tutorial
42:44 - was from june
43:06 - all right let me check back in the live
43:08 - chat we'll go to the next suggestion
43:10 - here
43:32 - so
44:17 - all right let's see
44:21 - all right so a few of you are saying so
44:24 - george and at ashish are saying
44:29 - uh that
44:32 - they think i did not save the
44:34 - electron.js file i really hope that that
44:37 - is the issue
44:38 - so let's try it again now that i've
44:40 - saved it
44:44 - if that was it i'm going to be really
44:46 - happy and i'm going to laugh oh that was
44:50 - it
44:50 - [Music]
44:52 - yes
44:54 - i'm so glad that that was it
44:56 - i mean it
44:57 - it's so silly and i'm sorry that
45:00 - we
45:01 - wasted so much time
45:04 - check it out
45:05 - here we go we have a desktop app
45:10 - built with react
45:14 - so yeah it's it works and you can see
45:17 - this is running in
45:20 - the electron
45:22 - window so it's not like
45:25 - right it says electron up here right and
45:30 - awesome
45:34 - all right
45:39 - thanks again uh george and
45:43 - ashish um
45:46 - you all were right on target that was i
45:49 - i can't believe you caught that
45:51 - and i can't believe i forgot to save it
45:53 - so
45:54 - uh sorry
45:56 - i think i already said i'm sorry but
45:57 - i'll say it again in case i didn't i am
45:59 - sorry that i forgot to save this
46:02 - and we spent so much time
46:04 - [Music]
46:07 - all right
46:10 - okay
46:11 - great
46:13 - um
46:17 - i gotta take a drink of
46:19 - my g-fuel energy stuff because i just
46:22 - feel like yawning all the time and now
46:25 - it's a good time to take a little break
46:40 - so again
46:43 - if anybody's watching from g fuel
46:46 - i'd be happy to drink this on every show
46:48 - if you sent me some for free
46:51 - just putting that out there
46:54 - um
46:59 - all right
47:01 - great
47:02 - well let me think
47:04 - let me think what we should do next then
47:08 - i really thought like oh that's it like
47:10 - we're not getting anything else done
47:12 - all right let me check my time okay so
47:15 - it is 2 18 p.m my time so we are on
47:18 - track uh
47:20 - i'm pretty sure i will be able to make
47:22 - it to my meeting
47:24 - on time
47:27 - okay
47:28 - so we have what 14 more minutes in this
47:30 - pomodoro cycle great
47:32 - let's figure out what we're going to do
47:34 - then
47:37 - so i'm not going to touch this file
47:39 - again
47:41 - since it's working i don't want to mess
47:43 - it up
47:45 - let me
47:48 - get rid of some of these things that i'm
47:49 - not using
47:51 - okay so now
47:52 - let's check out let me close this we
47:55 - don't need it and let's check this out
47:57 - right we have a normal
48:00 - see our app.js right this is a normal
48:04 - um
48:05 - react app right
48:08 - so
48:09 - this should be
48:12 - uh yeah i mean i'm assuming that this
48:14 - should work out
48:15 - just like normal
48:16 - i
48:17 - also am assuming that there are probably
48:20 - some things that you can do with
48:23 - electron
48:24 - to work with some of like the underlying
48:27 - stuff in the operating system
48:30 - so
48:31 - if we need to do that which we might
48:33 - then
48:34 - we'll we'll get to that
48:37 - uh but for now
48:39 - um
48:41 - yes alright harshit you know exactly
48:44 - where i was going with that right
48:46 - so harsh it says copy your build files
48:48 - from the resource center to the public
48:50 - folder and you'll be good to go exact
48:53 - yes
48:54 - i it's just
48:56 - right when i opened this up
48:58 - i started thinking wait a second we use
49:00 - create react app for the resource center
49:04 - already
49:05 - so this will definitely work
49:07 - so let's do that
49:09 - let's first
49:12 - um
49:14 - let me find i think i still have it open
49:18 - bulletin franciscan
49:20 - i do not have it open
49:22 - okay
49:23 - uh
49:24 - let me
49:28 - let me open this up then
49:35 - uh
49:37 - i'm just gonna grab the resource center
49:40 - code from github
49:44 - and
49:48 - the so on my other screen that's that's
49:50 - what i'm getting right now so i
49:53 - we do need to bring in some stuff from
49:55 - the package json
49:59 - um
50:01 - probably a lot of stuff
50:06 - uh
50:13 - well um
50:23 - what do i need to bring it
50:26 - all right let me just bring in
50:28 - some of the ui stuff because now that i
50:30 - look at this
50:33 - like we have a formidable package json
50:36 - file here
50:38 - uh for that
50:39 - resource center
50:41 - so
50:43 - i'm not gonna pull everything over right
50:44 - now
50:48 - um
50:50 - okay what's harsh it's saying
50:52 - um
50:55 - arson says we bootstrapped
50:57 - uh sorry a harsh it says only the build
50:59 - files not the source
51:04 - no need of source
51:06 - really we can just bring over the billet
51:09 - files
51:14 - all right well let me
51:17 - get the build faucet
51:29 - uh hopefully i built this
51:32 - somewhere so let's go
51:39 - i'm looking for the
51:41 - project folder on my other screen here
51:45 - resource center
51:55 - food
51:58 - okay
52:00 - and
52:05 - okay
52:07 - let's copy that and
52:10 - see where we're at
52:20 - all right hold on
52:22 - i'm reading your stuff harsha don't
52:23 - worry
52:26 - um
52:27 - okay so copy the build files to the
52:31 - public folder
52:33 - all right
52:34 - let's grab these now
52:37 - let me make sure it's in here
52:59 - all right so evidently i can't just copy
53:00 - and paste right into there
53:02 - so let me find the right folder in my
53:05 - file structure
53:07 - uh this shouldn't take long here it is
53:11 - there we go um yeah let's replace
53:14 - replace replace
53:19 - okay
53:21 - see what's gonna happen
53:26 - i suppose
53:29 - and run app in production
53:40 - all right so what do i do to run this
53:50 - ah
53:54 - okay so first it says in the build
53:57 - folder uh okay
54:00 - so not in the public folder in the build
54:02 - folder
54:04 - all right
54:08 - whoa
54:14 - no
54:19 - what just happened
54:40 - hmm
54:50 - i can't
54:52 - dang it
54:53 - all right so
55:01 - all right let's find
55:04 - what did we have before
55:06 - index
55:14 - hang it
55:19 - okay
55:25 - all right says change the dev stuff from
55:28 - line number 13.
55:38 - are we talking about line number 13 in
55:40 - our package json or in another folder
55:43 - or another file i mean
55:50 - and electron.js okay
55:54 - line 13
55:58 - okay so this is set
56:00 - for the build
56:02 - file
56:04 - okay
56:11 - all right let me grab that build folder
56:14 - and bring it in the whole folder this
56:16 - time
56:33 - okay so we should have a build folder
56:35 - now
56:39 - why didn't it show up
56:41 - let's see electron build
56:51 - that's weird
56:52 - um
56:56 - all right so
56:58 - harsh is saying remove
57:01 - local oh okay
57:03 - okay
57:04 - um
57:08 - i'll just do this that'll work right
57:11 - because it'll flip around that ternary
57:17 - alright so let's start this again
57:20 - see what happens
57:40 - all right so i'm getting something so
57:43 - it now says resource center
57:46 - did it say resource center before i
57:48 - don't even remember
57:49 - um
57:50 - i don't think it did
57:52 - it did open so here's where it opened at
57:56 - um
57:57 - it didn't
57:58 - really do anything
58:00 - let's check out our
58:05 - it actually shouldn't be running should
58:07 - it
58:08 - yeah it should not well i mean
58:14 - should we have it
58:19 - oh okay it because it's yarn start so
58:21 - that that does make sense um
58:26 - all right then
58:35 - all right how do i open dev tools
58:38 - in here there's got to be ah
58:56 - okay
58:59 - i i thought i saw something about
59:02 - devtools late i think it was later on in
59:06 - the uh
59:07 - in the thing so actually there's a lot
59:09 - more to this tutorial so maybe
59:11 - maybe i should have gone through the
59:13 - whole thing first
59:16 - ctrl shift i
59:33 - all right so that's not working for me
59:35 - so let's do
59:43 - okay
59:58 - right so let's
60:04 - see the top bar
60:11 - yes awesome
60:14 - great job
60:16 - uh thanks harsh it
60:18 - so the top bar did have an option
60:21 - to open dev tools so
60:25 - where is my dark theme at come on
60:33 - what
60:34 - is it gonna work
60:36 - no i can't do the dark theme on here
60:40 - i don't know we might just have to quit
60:41 - this project
60:43 - you can
60:45 - can't work with all this white
60:47 - um
60:49 - all right so let's see what's going on
60:54 - okay
60:56 - all right this makes sense um so since
60:59 - we didn't actually build things
61:01 - we just transferred this over
61:04 - uh these files
61:07 - static css main
61:12 - no wait a second they should still be
61:13 - there
61:15 - i still can't see it in there
61:18 - dang it um
61:27 - all right let me find it
61:29 - build
61:30 - static
61:32 - css
61:44 - now
61:45 - they're there i can see them
61:47 - in the file structure
61:57 - hmm
62:11 - all right so why
62:17 - food
62:25 - maybe i need
62:32 - i should say change it to file protocol
62:35 - in the files
62:41 - i am not sure
62:44 - hardship i'm not sure what your um
62:47 - what you're asking me to do so sorry
62:49 - about that
62:51 - uh
62:52 - could you explain it to me
62:55 - a little more
62:56 - please
63:13 - michael says after everything else this
63:15 - morning the lack of a dark theme in
63:17 - devtools might make you quit
63:19 - i just sat coming
63:24 - i will really quit over um
63:27 - the lack of a dark theme
63:50 - oh okay i get it harsh all right this
63:53 - will be let me check my time
63:55 - this will be the last thing i do if it
63:57 - works awesome if not
63:59 - we'll just continue this a different day
64:02 - so harsh is saying change it from
64:06 - http
64:08 - to file
64:10 - because this thinks
64:14 - it's a plain url and this thing ccp is
64:17 - playing europe okay
64:23 - so let's see
64:26 - change
64:27 - okay yeah so it is saying file here now
64:30 - where
64:33 - um
64:42 - all right so
64:45 - where am i
64:50 - i'm gonna look for this at
64:54 - why can i still not see this folder
65:03 - i want to like refresh
65:25 - oh well i'll just open it manually
65:39 - there is a refresh icon in here
65:42 - oh there it is
65:45 - yes awesome thank you again
65:48 - uh harshit
65:52 - in case you didn't catch it earlier i am
65:54 - going to use visual studio code now
65:56 - which is not my normal editor so
65:58 - if i make mistakes in here i blame it on
66:00 - that
66:01 - [Laughter]
66:03 - all right let's check it out and see
66:05 - [Music]
66:07 - we should be trying to get the files
66:10 - somewhere in here
66:11 - right
66:16 - there we go um so if we change this to
66:21 - file
66:24 - right and what it was is saying
66:30 - the file
66:35 - i have all the slashes
66:42 - sorry
66:57 - me
67:02 - and what else were we looking for
67:06 - maine
67:08 - and static
67:11 - there we go
67:14 - um
67:16 - do we need these slashes probably not
67:19 - right
67:22 - or do we
67:24 - see if this will work
67:27 - three slashes
67:41 - all right let's try that
67:42 - so cameron cameron's saying three
67:45 - slashes
67:46 - we'll give it a shot
67:48 - and
67:50 - whoa
67:51 - couldn't select your background color
67:52 - from the all right
67:54 - just close this for now
68:00 - see what happens
68:09 - all right so still same thing let's see
68:12 - what the errors are this time though
68:16 - um
68:17 - where did we find that
68:19 - before
68:24 - there we go
68:27 - hey the dark theme it came back okay so
68:31 - the project is saved now
68:35 - um
68:43 - okay john b says the triple slash is
68:46 - normal for the file protocol and header
68:49 - in chrome when the path is localhost
68:54 - remove the slash
68:57 - how many of the slashes
69:07 - jordan says hi hey jordan how's it going
69:13 - all right uh let's try to remove
69:16 - one slash now
69:27 - oh okay harsh say move move all remove
69:29 - all the slashes all right
69:35 - and like
69:37 - remove everything
69:42 - all right
69:45 - let's try that then
70:01 - as she says
70:03 - ngrok now shows resource center that's
70:05 - cool
70:15 - all right we'll give it a shot
70:24 - all right
70:27 - cool check it out
70:30 - oh nice
70:32 - look at that
70:34 - look at that
70:40 - it's working

71:06 - wow
71:09 - very cool
71:10 - so i mean we have some
71:13 - some stuff right
71:15 - uh that's not exactly working correctly
71:18 - but
71:20 - a lot of the content is there
71:23 - there's some weird stuff yeah there's
71:26 - some weirdness going on with the hover
71:28 - so it's not perfect but
71:32 - i mean that's a lot like that's that
71:34 - saved a lot of time
71:36 - very cool
71:40 - all right okay cool so
71:42 - that's all i'm going to do today as far
71:44 - as code for the rest of the time

72:57 - okay cool
72:58 - i'm gonna switch back over to this and
73:01 - i'll go back to the um the view of my

73:35 - out native bass
73:39 - i've not checked it out
73:44 - maybe i have to check that out
73:46 - it says it uses next which is cool
73:48 - because i'm already familiar with next
73:53 - uh so thanks everyone for uh for
73:56 - you know this all the suggestions we
73:58 - were trying to figure out what was going

75:07 - i'm i'm glad you liked it
75:09 - i have not seen it but
75:12 - now maybe i'll check it out
75:33 - oh i see harshad had an idea to try this
75:35 - on a clone of the resource center
75:39 - actually
75:40 - that would have been a much better idea
75:44 - would have resulted in the same thing
75:46 - right but instead of having to copy and
75:47 - paste stuff i would have
75:50 - yeah
75:51 - that would have been cool too
76:24 - uh it's some
76:26 - at some point rohan said time to update
76:28 - your resume
76:30 - i'm not i don't know what that was in
76:32 - reference to so if you're still watching
76:33 - let me know i'm not sure what i was
76:35 - talking about at that point in the live
76:36 - chat
76:38 - or maybe rohan's not even addressing
76:40 - that to me i'm not sure let me know
76:42 - please
76:47 - dimitri said how to be so cool coder
76:50 - like he
76:51 - um
76:52 - [Music]
76:54 - i don't know about being cool but
76:56 - um
76:58 - dimitri if you're still uh here watching
77:01 - us
77:02 - i would try if you want to start out
77:04 - being a coder
77:06 - i don't know how much you know already
77:08 - but if you're just beginning check out
77:10 - freecodecam.org
77:13 - sign up
77:14 - try out some of the exercises they're
77:16 - pretty um
77:18 - they're pretty easy at first and then
77:20 - get harder but that might give you an
77:22 - idea of maybe
77:24 - if you kind of like that kind of like
77:26 - front end uh programming stuff there's a
77:29 - lot of other things to do but
77:31 - check that out i guess there's a ton of
77:33 - other resources so if you're interested
77:35 - let me know send me something on twitter
77:37 - or you know here in the live chat or
77:39 - something and um i'd be happy to talk to
77:41 - you and figure out what you're
77:42 - interested in and points you the right
77:44 - direction maybe
78:06 - i see sanjay's said hi just joining the
78:09 - stream what has been happening since the
78:10 - start of the stream um it looks like
78:13 - cars should give gave an answer there um
78:16 - that was good basically says we
78:17 - bootstrapped an electron react project
78:19 - yep that's pretty much it we just did
78:21 - the basic setup uh create react app
78:24 - and we added an electron
78:27 - and then that gave us
78:30 - we've copied over some files from
78:31 - another project
78:35 - and that gave us kind of a basic
78:37 - basic app there's still some things that
78:39 - aren't working right and we haven't even
78:41 - tested out the forms at all so there's
78:43 - still some work to be done but
78:45 - we definitely saved a lot of time with
78:47 - actually building things out and
78:49 - designing
79:09 - uh let's see i've got some writing in
79:14 - maybe is that cyrillic characters so let
79:17 - me get out
79:18 - my trusty google translate here
79:21 - and see what that is
79:35 - so it looks like uh
79:37 - ilia says uh glory to ukraine
79:41 - all right so i guess elias from ukraine
79:44 - cool thanks for watching
80:10 - oh cool michael said i'm off to try the
80:12 - pomodoro clock on free code camp
80:15 - awesome i probably not still listening
80:18 - since you said that 10 minutes ago but
80:20 - uh good luck with that and once you
80:23 - finish it i'd love to see it if you have
80:25 - it publicly available or on github or
80:27 - something so
80:29 - um let me know if you're cool with me
80:31 - looking at it
80:41 - uh nino says how long have you been
80:43 - coding
80:44 - um
80:46 - five years
80:47 - but the first like year
80:50 - i wasn't
80:51 - i was working on websites but it was
80:53 - mostly like css stuff really basic
80:56 - um
80:57 - i don't i don't know
81:00 - some i don't know if you call css work
81:03 - and html stuff coding or not so
81:06 - depending
81:07 - you know but definitely for the last
81:09 - like
81:10 - solid like three years of javascript
81:14 - and i've been a full-time front-end
81:16 - developer for a little over two years
81:17 - now
81:21 - um harshit says can you show us the
81:24 - react native stuff is it working native
81:27 - bass and splash screen stuff yeah it's
81:30 - working it is working
81:33 - let me i turned off the server
81:36 - let me
81:37 - let me turn it back on so i'm gonna turn
81:39 - off this
81:41 - for now
81:42 - because they're both trying to run on
81:44 - poor 3 000
81:48 - all right
81:50 - control
81:51 - what is this
81:54 - devs
81:59 - [Music]
82:02 - all right it's just gonna run i'll try
82:05 - to run it in the emulator but last time
82:07 - i tried to do that it's um
82:10 - oh shoot am i starting the wrong thing
82:14 - i think i am
82:17 - i am
82:19 - hold on i have it over here
82:23 - there we go
82:29 - um anyway last time i tried to start the
82:32 - ios emulator it didn't work so
82:36 - i'll give it a shot again if not i'm
82:38 - just gonna have to put my phone up to
82:40 - the
82:41 - camera which i know is not ideal
82:44 - um
82:45 - actually i could use
82:47 - i might have a better option we'll see
82:49 - let's see what happens i i have a
82:52 - simulator come on work this time
82:55 - hmm okay did not work this time maybe i
82:57 - have to update some stuff
82:59 - let's go with because of a problem
83:02 - that's very descriptive
83:06 - it's a simulator cannot be open because
83:08 - of a problem
83:10 - all right um
83:13 - you know what we'll probably let's save
83:14 - this for another stream because
83:19 - i could probably try to open it while
83:20 - i'm answering other questions but i have
83:22 - a meeting in six minutes right now so
83:24 - um
83:28 - let me
83:29 - i'll try to get it on here
83:34 - all right
83:35 - so let's
83:38 - here you check this out here if it is
83:41 - going to work you'll you'll see it work
83:42 - i'll keep reading
83:45 - um let's see
83:51 - nino says what other technologies do you
83:53 - know
83:54 - um
83:56 - no
83:57 - something went wrong no
84:04 - all right try it again
84:06 - it was it seriously just worked earlier
84:08 - uh today
84:10 - um
84:13 - let's see
84:14 - where's okay i know um so in addition to
84:18 - html css and javascript all right i'll
84:20 - just show you all um tomorrow
84:23 - um
84:24 - i would love to show you right now i
84:25 - just uh don't have time to
84:28 - figure out why this isn't working
84:30 - um
84:32 - so in addition to html javascript css i
84:34 - know a little bit of php
84:37 - um a tiny tiny bit of c-sharp
84:41 - i once made a calculator in c plus plus
84:43 - but i don't remember pretty much any of
84:45 - it now
84:47 - um
84:49 - that's about it i've done like super
84:50 - basic things in java and in python
84:54 - um so
84:56 - i think that's that's it like coding
84:58 - wise
84:59 - uh nina says do you have a website or
85:00 - portfolio i do have a website that
85:03 - that's old and hasn't been updated in a
85:05 - really long time it's just
85:07 - jesseweigle.com if you want to see it
85:09 - don't laugh when you see it
85:11 - actually you can laugh if you want to
85:13 - it's
85:14 - like i said it's been a really long time
85:17 - uh since i worked on that site
85:20 - a better thing is to check out my github
85:22 - page
85:23 - which is linked in the description
85:26 - check that out that has my recent
85:29 - projects in it
85:32 - let's see
85:34 - dimitri says why you so relaxed
85:40 - um
85:45 - i don't know this is just my normal
85:47 - i'm not really sure why you're asking if
85:50 - i'm so relaxed
85:52 - um i mean i'm generally a pretty relaxed
85:56 - person
86:03 - let's see
86:09 - i should ask if i had xcode installed i
86:11 - do have xcode installed but it's
86:12 - possible that it needs updated
86:15 - rohan said use visor to mirror the
86:17 - screen i do have visor i just didn't
86:18 - think i'd have time to get it started
86:26 - all right
86:28 - okay three minutes to my meeting so i
86:29 - really do have to go now thank you
86:31 - everyone for watching uh and for
86:33 - participating a live chat you all helped
86:35 - so much when i was messing things up
86:38 - uh but it's really cool first time ever
86:41 - for me and for the stream we got a uh an
86:44 - electron app started and it's actually
86:46 - running right now
86:47 - on my imac
86:49 - and um
86:50 - well it was running i just shut it off
86:52 - but it was running
86:54 - and uh we had styles there were buttons
86:57 - and links and they worked so
86:59 - really cool i'm excited about that uh we
87:01 - got further along than i thought we
87:03 - would which is great
87:05 - and tomorrow i'm not sure what we'll be
87:08 - working on tomorrow because we have a
