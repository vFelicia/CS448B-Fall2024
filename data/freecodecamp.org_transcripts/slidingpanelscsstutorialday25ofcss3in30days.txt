00:00 - good day everybody welcome back to css3
00:01 - in 30 days today's day number 25 and
00:04 - we're going to be coding up some sliding
00:05 - css3 panels let me show you what that
00:07 - looks like here we go down in our final
00:09 - result i basically just have an image
00:12 - and when you hover over that image bam
00:15 - an element slides
00:17 - in to frame with some text so this one's
00:19 - sliding from the top when you slide when
00:21 - you hover back out it slides back out of
00:23 - the frame sliding from the right
00:26 - sliding from the bottom
00:27 - and sliding from the left so maybe
00:30 - already you have some ideas of how you
00:32 - might want to use this
00:33 - the fact is in css3 it's incredibly easy
00:36 - to code this up typically you'd use a
00:39 - plug-in or you'd write some javascript
00:41 - or jquery to achieve this effect but in
00:44 - css3 like i said it's incredibly easy
00:46 - it's slim and lightweight and i want to
00:48 - show you how to do that right now so up
00:51 - here in the sandbox you'll see what
00:53 - we're going to be working with is an
00:54 - image with some text above that
00:56 - and we're going to hide that text into
00:58 - an element we're going to slide that in
01:00 - from the top bottom left and right
01:02 - over here in our code editor go ahead
01:04 - and download 25 sliding panels and get
01:06 - it queued up in your favorite code
01:08 - editor
01:09 - and here in our index.html let me just
01:11 - show you the markup so you're familiar
01:13 - here in the sandbox we have a section
01:16 - with a level four heading that says
01:17 - slide from top
01:19 - that doesn't really matter that's just
01:21 - telling you what each section will
01:24 - include it's this element that matters
01:26 - to you right here the div with the class
01:27 - of slide
01:29 - and then slide top right bottom and left
01:32 - respectively within that div we have a
01:34 - div with the class of slide content and
01:35 - some text and then an image with the
01:38 - source of a placeholder image that i
01:41 - pulled from place img.com
01:44 - and that's a free placeholder website
01:45 - you can use that for your own
01:46 - placeholders i'm using that in this
01:48 - project
01:50 - and again you can put any image you want
01:51 - in there it doesn't really matter it
01:53 - doesn't have to be an image it can be
01:54 - content so let's get started over here
01:57 - in our sandbox
01:59 - let's start right from the top we're
02:01 - going to say class of slide
02:03 - we're going to go position relative
02:06 - display inline block
02:08 - and overflow hidden that's because we
02:11 - want that element on the inside of slide
02:14 - to be out of view when it's not within
02:16 - that frame and now we're going to say
02:18 - slide and then image
02:20 - we're going to say display inline block
02:23 - this one's going to be vertical align
02:26 - middle
02:27 - and that's going to align that
02:29 - image within the middle of the element
02:32 - if you're uncertain about how a style
02:34 - works whether in this video
02:36 - or any of the videos or just in your
02:38 - projects
02:40 - take it out reverse engineer the the
02:43 - work that you create so if you don't
02:44 - know what this specific
02:47 - property does then remove it and see how
02:49 - it affects the output and then add it
02:51 - back in modify the values and see and
02:54 - experiment that's how i learned as a web
02:56 - developer as i started building more and
02:57 - more projects so and that's how i
02:59 - encourage you to also learn how to
03:01 - understand css properties and values
03:03 - okay vertical line middle
03:06 - now we're going to jump in and maybe
03:08 - let's just see what that looks like if
03:09 - it does anything so over here in our
03:11 - final result in the sandbox rather
03:14 - you're going to see that it doesn't
03:16 - actually do anything so far because
03:18 - we're not telling it to do anything
03:19 - specific we're not actually modifying it
03:22 - too much so let's move on to the
03:24 - class of slide
03:26 - dash content
03:28 - and we're going to say position
03:31 - absolute because we're going to move
03:32 - that content the content is that pink
03:34 - box that's going to slide in and out
03:37 - we're going to say top
03:40 - 0
03:41 - left 0
03:44 - right 0 and bottom zero
03:47 - so it's stress so they're all anchored
03:50 - so each side is anchored to every
03:52 - respective side if that makes sense
03:56 - width 100
03:59 - height 100 we just want to make this
04:01 - expand to the full size of its parent
04:03 - element slide
04:06 - and now what we want to do is give it a
04:07 - z index of
04:10 - one so it's just in front of
04:12 - everything we're going to use flexbox
04:16 - here display
04:17 - flex
04:19 - align items this is a flexbox property
04:21 - flexbox based properties we're going to
04:23 - align the items
04:24 - center
04:27 - justify the content center
04:30 - and then text align center
04:32 - just covering our basis here let's see
04:33 - this looks like so far
04:35 - look at this so this is what it's
04:37 - starting to look like
04:38 - it's dead center if i were to remove the
04:40 - last few
04:41 - properties here
04:43 - maybe even if i took out display flex as
04:44 - well so let me take all of this out so
04:47 - there we go you can't really see any
04:48 - change when i take out flex but watch if
04:50 - i took flex out and tried align item
04:52 - center it's not going to do that it's
04:54 - not going to vertically align that but
04:56 - if i go display
04:57 - flex
04:59 - those that align items is now going to
05:01 - work
05:02 - nice i like it typically in the past
05:04 - you'd have to make it
05:05 - display table and then have another
05:07 - element within there that says display
05:08 - table cell and then vertical align
05:10 - middle
05:12 - but this is way more lean
05:14 - using flexbox and it's better it's
05:15 - better to use flexbox rather than trying
05:17 - to go back to old school css table
05:20 - technology
05:22 - all right especially because tables are
05:23 - used for data whereas flexbox is
05:25 - specifically for visual modification all
05:28 - right
05:28 - now let's keep going and i'm going to
05:30 - say padding i want uh whoops i want to
05:32 - stay in slide content
05:35 - i want to give it a background color
05:36 - actually i want to see
05:39 - i want to see that uh
05:41 - background pink color so 225 comma 35 69
05:46 - and 0.9 a little bit see-through
05:49 - and then we're going to give it a
05:50 - padding of 20 pixels so that it doesn't
05:52 - over
05:53 - so it doesn't go out into the edge of
05:55 - the
05:56 - parent
05:57 - the text color to be white
06:00 - and i want to give it a box size box
06:03 - sizing
06:05 - of border box because that padding i
06:06 - don't want to have it be 100 wide plus
06:09 - 20 pixels i just want it to be 100 and
06:11 - the padding within it
06:13 - i write
06:15 - transition
06:17 - transform
06:17 - [Music]
06:19 - s seconds and then ease
06:22 - so that's going to transition the
06:24 - transform property
06:26 - that we
06:28 - that we did we add transform property
06:30 - yet no but we will
06:32 - upon hover so
06:34 - save that let's check it out so now
06:36 - we've got that style it looks good
06:39 - but now what i want to do is hide it
06:42 - and then have it slide in when i hover
06:45 - so let's make that happen so now i'm
06:47 - going to say slide
06:49 - hover
06:51 - and then i want to say slide dash
06:53 - content so now what i'm going to do is
06:55 - say transform
06:57 - translate and the translate
07:00 - value
07:01 - allows us
07:03 - to
07:05 - position where we want to see
07:08 - this animation so zero
07:11 - and zero now what that means is upon
07:13 - hover i want it to go to zero and zero
07:14 - that's x and y
07:16 - but here
07:18 - let's say
07:20 - directions
07:21 - now what i want to do is say
07:23 - slide dash top and then slide dash
07:25 - content so i'm specifically styling the
07:28 - slide top element here and i'm going to
07:30 - say
07:31 - transform
07:33 - translate
07:35 - so this is by default this is not on
07:36 - hover i'm specifically targeting
07:39 - each uh
07:40 - each element now
07:42 - i want to say translate 0 and negative
07:44 - 100 percent
07:47 - save that
07:48 - that's going to move it up
07:51 - 100 of its size its height
07:53 - so now there we go slide from top you
07:55 - don't see the element you just see the
07:57 - image of the cat hover
07:59 - slides down just like that why do we use
08:01 - translate because the animation is much
08:04 - more smooth it goes by points of pixels
08:07 - rather like fractions of pixels rather
08:09 - than one pixel 2 pixel 3 pixel and it's
08:11 - a lot smoother of an animation
08:14 - especially when you have like a retina
08:16 - screen and you have really high a really
08:18 - nice video card and all that sort of
08:20 - stuff
08:21 - using translate is better for animations
08:23 - versus using position for animation so
08:26 - maybe we can have a look at that let me
08:27 - make this animation go really really
08:29 - slow 10 seconds let's see what that does
08:33 - so
08:34 - very very smooth
08:36 - i don't even see any clunks at all now
08:38 - if i were to use
08:40 - let's say
08:41 - instead of transforms let's hide this
08:44 - and let's just use something like top
08:47 - negative 100
08:49 - and then if i go
08:51 - top actually this would be negative 100
08:54 - and this one will be zero and take
08:56 - transition let's go all
09:01 - so i can already see chunks you might
09:03 - not see it in the recording i've got a
09:05 - retina screen
09:06 - um and it's a really large monitor so i
09:09 - can actually see
09:10 - i can see the the clunkiness if you made
09:13 - this go slower like really really slow
09:16 - something like 100 seconds we're not
09:17 - going to wait that long and then checked
09:19 - it out
09:21 - you're literally going to see it go down
09:23 - and
09:24 - you can actually see that
09:27 - see how it's going down
09:29 - it's just that's what the animation is
09:30 - actually doing if you're using uh top or
09:33 - the position that position property so
09:35 - we're actually going to change this to
09:38 - let's go back to translate and see if
09:40 - that actually makes a difference and i'm
09:42 - going to uncomment these
09:44 - remove this oh this is actually
09:46 - transform okay now let's check it out
09:50 - amazing difference
09:52 - proof is in the pudding right here so
09:54 - you can now see
09:56 - how that is literally
09:58 - sliding down like
10:00 - liquid even if it's if it's a slow
10:02 - animation maybe you're animating a scene
10:04 - of elements like a background scene of
10:06 - clouds and a mountain and mario running
10:08 - across the screen or something you would
10:10 - use transform and translate because
10:12 - that's going to slowly smooth it's going
10:16 - to be a smooth animation whereas when
10:18 - you use the top or bottom or left or
10:20 - right and use pixel values or percentage
10:22 - value values that's going to be a clunky
10:24 - animation this is just sliding down just
10:27 - super smooth so that is proof right
10:30 - there why you'd want to use transform
10:33 - translate
10:34 - for or any other proper translate 3d
10:37 - translate y and all these sorts of
10:38 - things these values
10:40 - for animations because it's very clear
10:43 - the difference in the animation so let's
10:46 - put that back
10:47 - to 0.3 seconds save that
10:50 - bam it's just nice
10:52 - really liking this okay so now all we
10:54 - got to do is just
10:56 - going to copy this
10:58 - paste it a few more times change the
10:59 - value from slide top to slide right and
11:01 - then slide bottom and then slide left
11:05 - and then you guessed it all we're doing
11:06 - is changing these values so slide top is
11:08 - fine
11:09 - we want to change slide right to x value
11:12 - negative 100 and the y value would be
11:15 - zero
11:16 - and then if you wanted slide bottom
11:18 - we're gonna do
11:20 - um and let's see here we're gonna go
11:23 - zero and one hundred percent
11:28 - and i was wrong here so side right is
11:30 - actually 100
11:32 - that way to the right
11:33 - and then bottom is 100 down slide left
11:37 - will be uh negative
11:40 - let me see negative 100 on the x and
11:43 - then zero on the y
11:46 - save that let's see if all of these work
11:48 - now we got slide from right beautiful
11:50 - slide from bottom perfect slide from
11:52 - left awesome now what if you wanted to
11:53 - slide from the top left top right bottom
11:55 - left or the bottom right you'd simply
11:58 - let's just use one of these for example
12:01 - um we're going to use just this one i'm
12:03 - going to say 100 and negative 100 let's
12:06 - see what that does that's the slide left
12:09 - see how it's coming from the top left
12:12 - that's what is happening there you just
12:14 - have to change these translate values
12:16 - the x and y i'm just going to switch
12:17 - that back and there we go slide left
12:19 - bottom right and top there we go there
12:22 - are sliding content panels with css3
12:25 - these are incredibly useful you can use
12:26 - them for displaying your services
12:28 - portfolio pieces let's say you're
12:29 - showing a picture of your portfolio and
12:31 - when you hover over it content panel
12:33 - slides in
12:34 - uh displays the title and a button to
12:36 - click here maybe you're just playing a
12:37 - product and you're selling something
12:39 - the price comes in with the call to
12:41 - action to purchase whatever it is that
12:43 - you want to do using these sliding
12:45 - content panels they're incredibly
12:46 - versatile i highly recommend you use
12:48 - these in your own projects and as you
12:50 - can see the css is way way way easy you
12:53 - don't need any plugins or any javascript
12:55 - or jquery plain vanilla straight up css3
12:58 - so thanks for joining me today in day
13:00 - number 25. see you tomorrow we're
13:02 - closing in on the home stretch here day
13:04 - 26 coming up see you there bye now
