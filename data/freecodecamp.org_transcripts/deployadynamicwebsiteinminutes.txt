00:01 - did you know it's possible to build a
00:02 - dynamic website in minutes without the
00:05 - use of heavyweight
00:06 - tools I'll show you how right now first
00:10 - let's grab a basic bootstrap template
00:12 - let's go to start
00:28 - bootstrap.css
00:30 - and unzip
00:32 - it now that I've unzipped
00:35 - it I can
00:37 - just drag the index to
00:40 - Chrome and this is what it looks like so
00:44 - it's got basic introduction it's got the
00:46 - portfolio Elements which I can click on
00:48 - to
00:49 - enlarge and it has an about section and
00:54 - it has a contact form unfortunately this
00:56 - contact form won't work because it's PHP
00:58 - and we don't want to have to mess with
01:00 - PHP we'd rather just have it work
01:02 - without PHP so there's a great tool for
01:05 - us to be able to use Dynamic forms on
01:09 - the web without any hassle at all it's
01:12 - called
01:12 - power. let's go to
01:16 - Power first we're going to create an
01:28 - account now we'll click sign up
01:33 - and we're going to choose from these
01:36 - different uh Dynamic elements we're
01:38 - going to choose contact form and we
01:40 - could use all these different Site
01:42 - Builders but we're just using ra HTML
01:43 - here so we can click VI
01:56 - tutorial all right and here is a quick
01:59 - tutorial so what we're going to do is
02:01 - we're going to add this script power. JS
02:04 - to our HTML at the bottom of the
02:07 - body so let's just open up index we're
02:11 - going to use a text editor I personally
02:13 - like adom which is a free text editor
02:15 - from
02:18 - GitHub and we'll scroll to the bottom of
02:20 - the
02:22 - body and we will just paste in power.
02:27 - JS next what we're going to to do is
02:31 - we're going to add an HTML
02:35 - element uh it's the Power contact form
02:38 - so let's go ahead and grab
02:39 - that and let's go ahead and put that in
02:43 - the contact form
02:48 - section so here's a contact Section what
02:51 - I'll do is I'll just delete everything
02:53 - out of
02:54 - this actually yeah I'll delete
02:57 - everything out of the contact Section
02:59 - except for the container I'll I'll keep
03:00 - the
03:05 - container and just paste it in here and
03:08 - save it and
03:10 - now let's see if we can add one more
03:13 - thing while we're here I really like to
03:16 - have a Twitter tool and there's a
03:18 - Twitter feed tool here
03:21 - too so basically we've already got pojs
03:24 - so all we need to do is add a Twitter
03:27 - feed div I'm not sure that this will
03:29 - look great right but basically I'm just
03:31 - going to put it right underneath the
03:32 - contact form for the purpose of
03:35 - demonstration so now we can save this
03:38 - and we can go to a tool called bit
03:43 - balloon bit balloon. comom makes for
03:46 - really easy
03:49 - deployment except you have to have the
03:52 - website maximized in order to be able to
03:54 - drag and drop it here so now I'm just
03:57 - going to take my entire folder
04:01 - this whole start bootstrap template
04:03 - freelancer thing and I'm going to drag
04:04 - it here it's going to give me a warning
04:07 - about us having Dynamic Pages um the PHP
04:10 - don't worry about that because remember
04:13 - we overwrote the PHP with the Power
04:17 - contact
04:28 - form
04:31 - and it's done so it'll give us a funny
04:33 - little name here and we can click on it
04:36 - and just open up the website and this is
04:39 - live on the internet we'll scroll
04:41 - down we'll see here our contact form
04:44 - that we can edit in line using
04:51 - power let's just change the
04:56 - uh let's change the background color
05:01 - just to show you how real time this is
05:03 - ugly purple all right and then we can
05:06 - just save
05:07 - it and close it and then here's the
05:10 - Twitter feed and right now it's
05:12 - power. but let's change it to
05:15 - me so we'll just do
05:18 - content and I'll just change this to
05:22 - oia or better yet let's do free code
05:27 - Camp save it
05:30 - you can see this is a live page on the
05:32 - internet with a working contact form
05:35 - I'll show you it
05:43 - works submit
05:46 - it and these are my Twitter this is my
05:49 - full Twitter feed which I can click on
05:51 - and it'll take me to actual
05:54 - tweets and I can retweet things from
05:58 - here if I were logged in um so now let's
06:02 - go to Power and let's check and see that
06:05 - the form came back the uh the email that
06:08 - I
06:21 - sent so my contact forms right
06:27 - here and I can mod here as well but what
06:31 - I really want to do is see my responses
06:34 - you can see that I've already received
06:35 - this response so again just to
06:40 - conclude you can
06:42 - create Dynamic websites in minutes using
06:46 - nothing more than
06:48 - HTML
06:50 - CSS and power. JS the power. tool and
06:56 - you can deploy it instantly with bit
06:58 - balloon to a real life place on the
07:01 - internet you can actually go to this URL
07:03 - if you want and check out this website
07:05 - it's live and it should remain live
07:07 - forever enjoy
