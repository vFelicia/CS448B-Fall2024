00:02 - hey what's up welcome back to css3 at 30
00:05 - days today we are going to be doing
00:07 - something really fun and that is
00:09 - creating a
00:11 - pac-man animation we're going to make a
00:13 - little pac-man chasing the blinky ghost
00:16 - across the screen and it's gonna be a
00:18 - lot of fun now what is pac-man uh if you
00:20 - don't know what pac-man is
00:22 - then google it i don't know anyone who
00:24 - doesn't know what pac-man is pac-man is
00:26 - a classic arcade game
00:28 - it's timeless it's a little yellow
00:30 - chomping uh ball that eats little
00:32 - pebbles along this maze and there's
00:35 - ghosts chasing him and when he gets a
00:37 - special pebble he gets to chase the
00:39 - ghosts and eat the ghosts and get bonus
00:40 - points really fun simple little game and
00:43 - we're just going to create a nice simple
00:45 - animation of pac-man moving along a pat
00:48 - moving along a path chasing the ghost so
00:50 - check this out in my browser and i'm
00:52 - going to show you what we're making
00:53 - check it out right here here it is
00:56 - now there are
00:58 - a number of things going on here all of
01:00 - this
01:01 - this entire thing is css
01:05 - just css there's no javascript nothing
01:07 - like that it's purely css
01:09 - animations and css3
01:12 - and that's what's exciting about it so
01:14 - let's check out what's going on here we
01:15 - have the path in the background with
01:17 - these little pebbles it's very simple it
01:18 - looks like he's eating them we also have
01:20 - a circle here and that circle is
01:22 - chomping
01:24 - and moving as well so a couple things
01:26 - there then we have this ghost blinky
01:29 - what blinky is doing is
01:31 - uh quite literally blinking colors so
01:33 - he's moving along the timeline as well
01:35 - along the path and he's blinking colors
01:37 - in and out from red to hot pink
01:40 - and he also has big googly eyes and his
01:43 - pupils are moving back and forth so he's
01:46 - got a number of things going on i
01:47 - haven't seen a css tutorial online yet
01:51 - other than this one where
01:53 - they
01:54 - code the ghost as well i've only seen
01:56 - css pac-man animations
01:59 - in varying degrees uh in different
02:01 - examples but i haven't seen one with the
02:02 - ghost so i wanted to throw the ghost in
02:04 - here because it's kind of exciting
02:06 - all right so let's get coding let's make
02:08 - our pacman and let's make our goats and
02:10 - let's animate them right now so jump
02:11 - over here in your code editor download
02:13 - 17 pacman you got the three files there
02:17 - again give you a moment to download
02:19 - those files and come right back here
02:22 - and and then i'm going to show you
02:23 - what's going on here so we've got our
02:24 - index file with some markup and i'm
02:26 - going to show you what's going on in
02:28 - terms of the html
02:30 - this is what the html looks like for the
02:32 - pacman we have a div with the class of
02:34 - path wraps everything that is the
02:36 - container which is simply that black
02:39 - path right here
02:41 - with the dots inside then we have div
02:43 - with the class of pac-man that is
02:44 - pac-man that's it for pac-man
02:47 - then we have a div the class of ghost
02:48 - which wraps uh a div with the class of
02:50 - eyes and div with the class of skirt so
02:53 - the eyes are the eyes and the pupils
02:56 - the skirt is the the bottom of the ghost
02:58 - those triangles that look like a skirt
03:01 - so and that's it for the markup you
03:04 - don't have to code it because it's
03:05 - already there this isn't an html course
03:07 - it's a css course but just to show you
03:08 - how simple the html is and all the magic
03:11 - happens in css jump into your sandbox
03:14 - okay so let's get started let's jump in
03:17 - and say we're going to start with path
03:20 - and that path is going to be a
03:22 - position of relative
03:25 - a width of 100 a height of 100 pixels
03:29 - a background of triple three but
03:31 - whatever color you want it to be works
03:33 - as well padding 20 pixels all around box
03:36 - sizing i want to be border box because i
03:38 - want it to be a fixed 100 pixel height
03:41 - if i
03:42 - don't declare border box i'm going to
03:44 - have 140 pixel height element because
03:47 - the padding adds to that height so i
03:48 - want it to be border box to keep that
03:50 - padding within it so the element is 100
03:52 - pixels height max
03:55 - overflow hidden very important because
03:58 - when the ghost when blinky and pac-man
04:00 - go off the screen out of the element i
04:02 - want them to disappear not slide outside
04:05 - and be visible and be kind of odd
04:07 - it would look like a little glitch
04:10 - so that's it for the path save that
04:12 - check it out here in the browser it's
04:14 - just gonna be a big long um
04:16 - like a dark gray rectangle all right
04:19 - jump back in here i'm just gonna
04:21 - tab in one and say path
04:24 - virtual element after
04:26 - content
04:27 - empty string
04:28 - position relative note position absolute
04:33 - okay
04:34 - display block
04:36 - border top
04:38 - 12 pixels dotted white what we're making
04:40 - here are those little pebbles along the
04:43 - middle of the path
04:45 - now if i say width 90 i have to give it
04:48 - a width because of the condition that
04:50 - it's in it's an after virtual element
04:53 - that you cannot see until you give a
04:55 - width
04:56 - and or a height
04:58 - so we got the width uh and the height is
05:00 - the 12 pixels of the top border so
05:03 - simply i'm creating an element
05:05 - that is
05:06 - just a top border
05:08 - the width is 90
05:10 - if we save that and check it out here in
05:11 - the browser we've got it right here
05:12 - we've got our 12 pixel dotted border
05:15 - we've got our 20 pixel padding on the
05:17 - left and the top as you can see very
05:19 - clearly
05:20 - the problem is is that this is not
05:22 - centered within the path
05:25 - vertically or horizontally so let's deal
05:27 - with that right now over here in the
05:28 - code editor simply going to say
05:31 - top 50 that's going to push it down 50
05:34 - percent of
05:35 - the height of that parent element
05:37 - and left five percent because
05:40 - we are ninety percent width if we want
05:41 - to fill a 100 width if we push it over
05:43 - five percent there's also five percent
05:45 - on the other side so now we're perfectly
05:47 - centered in terms of the top fifty
05:49 - percent we're going to have a little
05:51 - problem save that check it out it's
05:53 - perfectly centered horizontally but
05:54 - we've got too much space in the top
05:56 - that's because it's going 50 percent
05:59 - down from the top of this element so
06:01 - this actually here to here is exactly 50
06:04 - but i want it to be 50 from the center
06:07 - of these these uh dots
06:09 - because those dots are 12 pixels in
06:11 - height half of that if we bring it up
06:13 - half of those pixels it's going to be
06:15 - perfectly centered so margin top
06:17 - negative 6 pixels save that bam now we
06:20 - are perfectly centered both vertically
06:22 - and horizontally all right now let's get
06:25 - down to the fun stuff let let's create
06:27 - pac-man
06:29 - there's pac-man we're gonna say position
06:32 - absolute
06:33 - zed index 99 so he's always on top of
06:36 - everything top 50 we want him down 50
06:40 - from the
06:41 - top of the the path and now um that's it
06:44 - for now now you're not going to see
06:46 - pac-man because he is simply just a
06:48 - position a z-index and a top
06:52 - value there's nothing
06:54 - showing us visually that it's pac-man
06:56 - where that's going to come into play is
06:58 - the before and after virtual elements so
07:02 - let's go down
07:04 - and style those up we're going to say
07:05 - pac-man
07:07 - before and
07:09 - pac-man
07:11 - after
07:13 - in here we're going to give him content
07:14 - of an empty string display block and
07:17 - we're going to say height 0
07:19 - width 0 this is weird why are we doing
07:21 - this
07:22 - well we're actually going to create
07:24 - pac-man out of a border not actually out
07:28 - of creating a background color
07:31 - okay so we're gonna say position
07:33 - absolute
07:36 - and then we're gonna go border solid 30
07:39 - pixels yellow
07:42 - that save that check it out in the
07:44 - browser it's going to give us a yellow
07:45 - square
07:46 - and that's because we have we have a 60
07:48 - by 60 element because there's
07:52 - uh there's a border top there's a border
07:54 - left there's a border bottom and there's
07:55 - a border right of 30 pixels so now what
07:57 - we're going to do
07:58 - is
08:00 - we're going to remove certain sides of
08:03 - the border in order to give us the
08:05 - illusion or make it look like we have
08:07 - half circles now what do i mean by half
08:09 - circles i'm styling both before and
08:11 - after with these identical styles so
08:13 - there are two elements on top of each
08:14 - other if i move one over say pac-man
08:18 - after and i give him margin left of like
08:22 - like 65 pixels save that check it out in
08:25 - the browser i moved him over
08:28 - just enough so you can see there's two
08:30 - and so now now we're gonna leave it like
08:32 - that for now and then style it up so you
08:34 - can see what they both look like let's
08:36 - go back here to before and after and
08:38 - let's say margin top i want it to be
08:41 - negative 30 pixels so he's centered in
08:43 - that path
08:45 - border radius
08:47 - 100 should do the trick or 50
08:51 - 50 is fine should give us a perfect
08:53 - circle if i save that and check it out
08:55 - in the browser we got two perfect
08:56 - circles sitting in the middle of the
08:57 - path now let's remove some sides of the
09:00 - border
09:02 - border right
09:04 - color
09:05 - transparent
09:09 - save that
09:10 - check it out so i removed the right
09:12 - border of the four sides and now it
09:15 - actually looks like pac-man we're not
09:17 - going to stop there because we actually
09:19 - want two parts to this pac-man a top
09:21 - part and a bottom part
09:23 - and we're gonna make those chomp
09:24 - together
09:26 - in this manner i don't really know if i
09:28 - were just to have one chunk out of one
09:30 - side of a circle i don't really know how
09:32 - to connect those in an animation but
09:33 - what we can do is create two of these
09:36 - elements and animate them individually
09:38 - so it looks like there's a chomping
09:40 - animation
09:42 - this
09:42 - method specifically
09:45 - i'm going to give credit to travis
09:47 - nielsen of dev tips
09:49 - in his css animations tutorials on
09:52 - youtube check him out
09:54 - uh he created a pac-man loader and he
09:57 - did basically pac-man he called him a
10:00 - chomper chomp chomp
10:02 - and um
10:03 - he used the before and after virtual
10:05 - elements and animated those individually
10:07 - so uh i am going to give credit where
10:09 - credit is due
10:10 - this specific part is uh inspired by
10:12 - travis so thank you for that um the rest
10:15 - of it however is a mishmash of me just
10:17 - jamming and trying to figure out how to
10:19 - make this work
10:20 - so
10:22 - let's show you what's going on border
10:23 - right color we're also going to say
10:25 - border
10:26 - bottom color is transparent now watch
10:29 - what happens save that check it out bam
10:31 - now we've got two half circles because
10:33 - we cut out two parts of the border but
10:34 - now what we're going to do is make the
10:37 - the after virtual element
10:41 - uh have kind of an inverted version of
10:43 - that so we can you'll see what i mean so
10:45 - let's give the after pseudo element the
10:47 - border color of yellow to reset it back
10:50 - to a circle there it is
10:52 - now what we're going to do is say border
10:55 - right color
10:56 - is transparent
10:58 - and the border
11:01 - top color
11:03 - is transparent as well
11:05 - if i save that and check it out now we
11:07 - got the other side now this will make a
11:10 - lot more sense if i remove this margin
11:13 - left of pacman after and now they're
11:16 - connected and they look like a pac-man
11:18 - all we have to do now is animate those
11:21 - two separately to rotate
11:25 - a certain amount of degrees
11:27 - on both sides so it looks like a chomper
11:30 - let's do that right now so simply go up
11:32 - to
11:33 - the pac-man before after and we're going
11:35 - to give it an animation so animation
11:38 - we're going to name it mouth
11:40 - top and we're gonna do it over 0.7
11:44 - seconds
11:45 - ease
11:46 - infinitely
11:47 - infinite
11:49 - save that it's not going to work until
11:50 - we define a keyframe so go to the bottom
11:52 - and add your keyframes at the bottom of
11:54 - your style sheet that's usually a good
11:55 - place to do it keyframes this one's
11:57 - called mouth top
11:59 - and now it's just simply playing with
12:00 - timelines so we're going to say
12:03 - at the
12:04 - 50
12:06 - point of the timeline so this goes from
12:08 - 0 to one hundred percent
12:11 - you can also define it based on uh
12:13 - seconds i believe but anyway
12:15 - we got fifty percent way through the
12:17 - animation
12:20 - we are going to say transform this is
12:22 - just css rotate
12:25 - i'm going to say 44 degrees
12:27 - specifically chose that number for a
12:29 - reason i'll show you why
12:30 - save that refresh in your browser now
12:33 - it's all rotating 44 degrees
12:36 - but i want the bottom mouth to rotate
12:38 - negative 44 degrees so that one goes up
12:40 - rather than down as well so simply all
12:42 - we have to do is well while we're down
12:44 - here in the keyframes let's define
12:46 - another keyframe copy this one in fact
12:48 - save you some typing paste it call it
12:50 - mouth bottom
12:53 - rotate it negative 44 degrees
12:55 - scroll up to your before and after
12:58 - copy this style right here
13:00 - paste it in the after pseudo element
13:02 - style and change the name to mouth
13:04 - bottom same exact animation just
13:07 - inverted save it check it on the browser
13:09 - bam just like that chomping perfectly
13:12 - now why did i choose 44 well let me show
13:14 - you what happens when i do 46 degrees
13:17 - look at the back end the rear end of
13:19 - pac-man there's a little bit of a oops
13:23 - a little bit of a line that appears
13:24 - there and that's not okay
13:26 - 45 degrees shows the same hair line just
13:28 - a little smaller 44 degrees was the
13:30 - perfect number where i found no line at
13:32 - all where the mouth closed the most
13:36 - okay now all we have to do is move him
13:38 - so let's create another keyframe here
13:40 - and let's call it
13:42 - keyframes
13:43 - move
13:44 - forward
13:46 - and i'm just going to say at
13:49 - zero percent
13:50 - uh of the animation i want pac-man to be
13:54 - negative 20
13:55 - position i'll show you why in a moment
13:59 - and at 100
14:00 - i want him to be at left 100
14:03 - so that the left side of pac-man is
14:05 - going to be 100 so he's going to be off
14:07 - of the screen so if i
14:10 - save this and move up to pac-man
14:13 - give this an animation
14:16 - of
14:19 - animation
14:20 - we called it move forward
14:23 - five seconds linear and infinite save
14:27 - that check it out in the browser watch
14:28 - what happens see how he's coming out
14:30 - from off of the screen on the left side
14:32 - and then disappears on the right that's
14:34 - exactly what we want let me show you in
14:36 - that keyframe what happens if the left
14:37 - is actually zero percent what you might
14:40 - think he starts
14:42 - his left side of the element starts
14:44 - right here
14:46 - so he goes off screen but then just
14:48 - appears
14:49 - out of nowhere and it's not smooth
14:52 - but if we have it left negative 20
14:55 - where we know he's off the screen
14:59 - that's gonna solve the problem he slides
15:00 - out so he goes off the screen
15:03 - like that comes back out gently i like
15:06 - it
15:07 - you might even sample 10 and see what
15:09 - happens there
15:10 - if you wanted you could play around with
15:12 - a number maybe that looks a bit more
15:14 - like he's half off there and half coming
15:16 - out
15:17 - that works too so
15:20 - that's it for move forward now that's it
15:22 - for pac-man actually so
15:24 - we made a pac-man animation
15:26 - i could have left it here but i thought
15:28 - nah i wanna make a ghost and i wanna
15:30 - make that ghost run so let's do that
15:34 - and now we're gonna start styling up
15:35 - this ghost
15:37 - okay so now we're gonna say
15:39 - ghosts
15:42 - should have just called him boo
15:44 - ghost position
15:46 - absolute zed index 99 so he's on top of
15:50 - the screen as well top 50
15:53 - left twenty percent
15:56 - i'm doing that because i want him in
15:57 - front of pac-man i'll show you i'll show
15:59 - you a bit here
16:00 - margin top we're gonna bring him up
16:02 - negative 35 pixels because i want the
16:05 - height to be
16:07 - 70 pixels in height
16:09 - and the width to be 60 pixels in width
16:11 - so margin top is half of 70 so that it's
16:13 - perfectly aligned vertically in the
16:15 - center if i save that and go back here
16:19 - you actually won't see anything
16:20 - because we haven't given him any colors
16:23 - so let's go back to the ghost here again
16:25 - let's go background red let's get make
16:27 - him red save that now check out your
16:28 - browser so we've got a
16:30 - rectangle a red rectangle so now we just
16:32 - need to shape him out so let's say the
16:35 - border top
16:37 - uh
16:38 - the border top left
16:40 - radius is 70 pixels
16:43 - and the border top right radius is 70
16:46 - pixels watch what happens just the top
16:48 - rounds out the top left the top right
16:51 - that looks nice
16:53 - and
16:54 - now
16:55 - let's start
16:56 - shaping him out a little bit more he
16:58 - needs to have that skirt and the eyes
17:00 - so let's
17:02 - let's use as minimal amount of markup as
17:04 - possible
17:05 - and let's say uh goes before now what
17:08 - we're going to do
17:09 - is
17:10 - say goes before and then ghost
17:13 - after
17:15 - and now we're going to use this use the
17:18 - ghost before and after for
17:20 - the
17:21 - the googly eyes the the
17:23 - the white part of his eyes
17:26 - or her eyes
17:27 - content
17:29 - uh empty string position absolute
17:32 - background white
17:34 - height 25 pixels and width 20 pixels i
17:37 - want them to be not a perfect circle i
17:39 - want them to be like a long like a long
17:42 - eyeball
17:45 - border radius uh we're going to make
17:47 - that 100
17:48 - perfectly round
17:50 - uh rounded edges all over the place save
17:52 - it let's check it out see what happened
17:54 - here so we have the right shape i think
17:56 - that's the shape i want
17:58 - both of them are right there they're
17:59 - stacked on top of one another so we're
18:00 - going to have to move that
18:02 - so go back here in your code editor and
18:05 - let's simply say top
18:07 - 15 pixels from the top and then left
18:10 - we're going to go four pixels from the
18:12 - left now really i'm just styling this is
18:14 - where i want the before
18:16 - i to be i want the after eye to be over
18:19 - a bit so simply go down here we're going
18:20 - to declare
18:21 - a ghost
18:23 - after pseudo elements virtual element
18:27 - you know what i mean
18:29 - and we're just going to say left 28
18:31 - pixels that's the only thing we need to
18:32 - change save that check it out we've got
18:35 - our two white eyes starting to come
18:36 - together it looks pretty cool
18:38 - all right
18:40 - now let's style those eyes so i have an
18:44 - element called eyes
18:47 - in the markup but i want to use the
18:48 - before and after virtual elements as
18:50 - well so we're going to go eyes
18:52 - before
18:54 - and eyes
18:55 - after
18:56 - okay now again as usual content empty
18:59 - string so it can be visible on the
19:01 - screen position absolute so we can move
19:02 - it around wherever we want it outside of
19:04 - the flow of the document
19:06 - background blue we want blue eyes
19:10 - heights 10 pixels so these are the
19:11 - pupils
19:12 - i probably could have called these
19:13 - pupils but oh well
19:15 - width 10 pixels border radius 100
19:20 - that's border radius
19:21 - 100
19:23 - and uh save that let's see what's
19:25 - happening okay so there's our little
19:26 - blue eye up there we need to move it
19:28 - down and over a bit so back here
19:30 - top 25 pixels and left 5 pixels save
19:34 - that
19:36 - there it is
19:38 - looks good i don't think i need to do
19:40 - anything else with that one now i just
19:42 - need to move the second eye the after
19:45 - uh virtual element over
19:47 - so i'm going to say eyes
19:50 - after
19:52 - and left is going to be 30 pixels and
19:54 - that will move him over
19:57 - to the right spot i believe save that
19:59 - refresh
20:01 - uh it's i don't i don't see it
20:04 - i think this is a z-index problem go
20:06 - back here and both of them going to say
20:07 - that index 99 again save that bam there
20:10 - it is it was just hidden behind the i
20:12 - you couldn't see it so i needed to move
20:14 - that pupil forward using z-index that
20:17 - was important okay
20:19 - now
20:20 - uh we have one more thing to do here
20:22 - with the the look of this little blinky
20:26 - is the skirt is what i called it so
20:28 - let's go down another style here oops
20:31 - not there let's do it after the eyes
20:34 - and let's go skirt
20:38 - position
20:39 - whoops let's go position absolute
20:42 - height zero
20:44 - width zero
20:46 - uh border solid 10 pixels
20:50 - triple three doing this because i'm
20:52 - using borders for this
20:54 - and let's save that and see what it is
20:56 - so there we go we have a 10 pixel border
20:59 - that is 333 the color of the background
21:01 - so it looks it's gonna look like it's
21:03 - see-through the it's gonna look like
21:05 - we're creating those triangles so we
21:06 - have a square in order to create a
21:08 - triangle out of the border we need to
21:10 - remove the one of the sides so that you
21:12 - can see through it to see the red so
21:14 - watch this we're going to go border
21:17 - top
21:18 - color
21:20 - transparent
21:24 - and save that
21:25 - so okay now you can't really see
21:27 - anything there we're going to move it
21:28 - down to the bottom we're going to say
21:29 - bottom negative 10 pixels let's go
21:31 - bottom 0 to see where it is there it is
21:33 - but we want him to beat that to be down
21:35 - more so negative 10 pixels is the height
21:37 - of that element
21:40 - that should do the trick so there we go
21:42 - so we got one there but now we need to
21:44 - do a couple more so you can see how this
21:46 - is working as pac-man passes through him
21:48 - you can actually see where it's
21:50 - where it is okay
21:52 - so now what we need to do is simply
21:55 - uh style so we styled skirt with that
21:58 - style but now we're going to style the
21:59 - before and after
22:01 - virtual elements
22:02 - as well
22:04 - before
22:06 - and skirt
22:08 - after
22:09 - and now we're going to do is again
22:10 - content
22:12 - position at absolute
22:15 - height zero width zero
22:18 - border is gonna be solid 10 pixels
22:20 - triple three
22:23 - come to think of it i could have just
22:25 - styled this in a much more efficient
22:27 - manner why don't i go like this
22:30 - i'm gonna copy that i'm gonna remove all
22:32 - these styles for now
22:34 - i'm gonna paste this right there
22:37 - so all those have that style
22:40 - and i'm gonna move these slightly in a
22:43 - sec so save that check it out in the
22:45 - browser
22:46 - okay so you can't see them there because
22:47 - they're all stacked on top of one
22:48 - another so now all we got to do is style
22:50 - each of these individually so i'm going
22:51 - to split these out okay so now we're
22:54 - going to say before
22:55 - is going to have a left
22:59 - position of
23:01 - 10 pixels gonna move over 10 pixels and
23:04 - then the after is going to be moved
23:06 - over uh left 30 pixels
23:10 - save it let's check it out
23:12 - okay you don't see it because
23:15 - these actually have to have these are
23:17 - virtual elements so they have to have a
23:19 - content
23:21 - so simply all we're gonna do here is uh
23:25 - content empty string copy that
23:28 - after this is gonna have content empty
23:30 - string save that bam there it is just
23:32 - like that so now we have the three
23:34 - little uh
23:36 - skirt
23:38 - frills
23:40 - uh
23:41 - that
23:42 - make up this ghost so now this ghost
23:44 - looks done so now all we gotta do is
23:46 - move the ghost google his eyes and flash
23:50 - his color
23:53 - we already created the move animation so
23:55 - let's just move him
23:58 - uh so let's see what happens if we go
23:59 - back up to
24:01 - the
24:02 - ghost right here and wait here it is and
24:07 - let's give him the animation
24:09 - of
24:10 - animation
24:11 - move forward
24:13 - five seconds linear
24:15 - infinite
24:17 - save that and let's see what happens
24:19 - okay he's moving but where's pac-man
24:22 - pac-man is hiding directly behind him so
24:24 - that's a problem we need to separate
24:26 - them so what i'm going to do is just
24:29 - simply delay how long
24:31 - pac-man takes
24:33 - until he starts his animation
24:35 - you don't have to do anything really
24:36 - extra you just go up to pac-man
24:39 - and let me see here animation
24:42 - let's just have another line here called
24:44 - animation delay
24:47 - i'm going to delay him 0.8 seconds you
24:50 - can delete him however long you want
24:52 - and it will space him out from the ghost
24:54 - watch this
24:56 - okay
24:57 - do you see what has happened now they're
24:58 - spaced apart but when i refreshed look
25:01 - where pac-man was he was just sitting
25:02 - there and then he disappeared off the
25:04 - screen negative 20 and then started his
25:06 - animation that looks bad so all we have
25:08 - to do is move pac-man by default
25:12 - 20
25:13 - left off the screen so he's just going
25:14 - to be
25:15 - left negative 20
25:18 - save that
25:19 - now when he's waiting for his animation
25:22 - he's going to be off the screen and then
25:23 - he's going to come out
25:25 - so now perfect so now if i delay this
25:27 - longer like say two seconds
25:30 - these are going to be spaced apart a lot
25:32 - more
25:34 - like that
25:36 - and now looks like the ghost is chasing
25:37 - him i mean maybe that's fun maybe that's
25:39 - a cool way of doing it maybe you want to
25:40 - delay like 2.5 seconds
25:43 - see what that looks like
25:44 - halfway it's coming out and that looks
25:47 - like the ghost is chasing him
25:49 - and now like he's chasing the go
25:50 - whatever you want to do works totally
25:52 - fine i'm going to leave mine with
25:53 - something like maybe one second for now
25:56 - okay
25:57 - now
25:58 - the ghost needs to um
26:00 - let's make him
26:01 - [Music]
26:02 - flash let's make him blink
26:06 - blinky all right let's scroll down to
26:09 - the ghost
26:10 - we're going to create an animation
26:12 - called color swap or blink maybe you
26:15 - want to call it blink whatever works for
26:17 - you so let's go back to the ghosts and
26:20 - let's give him an animation so we did
26:21 - move forward but we're actually going to
26:22 - do another one you can do a comma and
26:24 - add another animation very easily just
26:26 - like this so we're going to say
26:28 - um
26:29 - you could say color swap like this you
26:31 - can call it
26:32 - blink you know blink is kind of a fun
26:34 - one
26:36 - blinky sure let's call it that
26:38 - and we're gonna say 0.5 seconds
26:41 - uh is how long it will take linear is
26:43 - the is the arc
26:45 - and infinite we're going to have it
26:47 - happen forever
26:48 - so save that uh we need to actually
26:50 - create that animation now called blinky
26:52 - so go down create a keyframe call it
26:56 - blinky
26:58 - and all we're going to do for blinky for
27:01 - swapping the color is halfway through
27:02 - the animation timeline change the
27:04 - background to hot pink
27:07 - halfway through it's going to swap to
27:09 - hot pink and then swap back to its other
27:11 - color so save that check it out so now
27:14 - he's blinking and you can change that
27:16 - color to whatever you want you can
27:17 - change it to i don't know like
27:19 - triple three i don't know what's going
27:20 - to happen
27:22 - looks like he kind of like disappears
27:23 - into the
27:24 - into the background which is kind of
27:26 - cool i kind of like that and maybe if i
27:28 - sped up the animation time i don't know
27:31 - like 0.2 seconds let's see what happens
27:35 - you know that's something
27:37 - 0.4 seconds let's see
27:39 - yeah i like that one that looks fun
27:41 - but you can have whatever color swap you
27:43 - want
27:44 - and um okay so that's good now what we
27:47 - got to do is we've got to make his eyes
27:50 - move back and forth so we got to make
27:51 - those little peepers uh move left and
27:54 - right
27:55 - so
27:56 - what we're going to do is go to the
27:59 - ghosts
28:00 - pupils which are eyes
28:04 - okay
28:05 - and let's
28:06 - go with before and after and we're going
28:09 - to say animation
28:11 - we're going to start with peeper left so
28:13 - the left peeper
28:14 - 0.7 seconds linear
28:17 - infinite again
28:20 - okay and now the we have to create an
28:22 - animation called paper left
28:26 - and so now if we just started with that
28:28 - let's go down the bottom create a
28:29 - keyframe
28:31 - called
28:32 - keyframes
28:33 - paper left and then what we're going to
28:35 - do with paper left
28:37 - is
28:38 - at zero percent comma and 100 percent so
28:42 - the left position of that is gonna be
28:43 - five pixels and that's because the
28:44 - position of the left eyeball is actually
28:48 - five pixels so i want it to be at its
28:50 - five pixel default state and then move
28:53 - over a little bit so let's move it over
28:56 - uh people left at the 50
28:59 - mark of the timeline i wanted to move
29:01 - over
29:02 - left let's move it over a little bit so
29:05 - sorry not that long i want it to be 10
29:06 - pixels
29:08 - over so if i save that we've already got
29:10 - that set up refresh so now you see how
29:13 - that eyeball is going back and forth but
29:15 - now the the right eyeball is not there
29:18 - so that's because it's getting the same
29:21 - animation as the left peeper so we want
29:24 - to separate that and have it have its
29:26 - own animation so while we're down here
29:28 - let's copy this
29:30 - and do another keyframe called peeper
29:33 - right
29:34 - and the left
29:36 - the zero and 100 percent part of the
29:38 - timeline is going to be 30 pixels from
29:40 - the left because that is the default
29:43 - state of the right eyeball
29:45 - up here you can see i after left 30
29:48 - pixels so we want it to start there and
29:51 - then move over probably 8 pixels and
29:53 - then do that so let's scroll back down
29:55 - to paper right the left position won't
29:57 - be ten percent uh save this actually
29:59 - we're gonna have to add that style uh so
30:02 - copy paper left on this one and and the
30:04 - after add paper
30:06 - right save that and watch what happens
30:09 - right here so that's super weird
30:11 - unless that's the style you're going for
30:13 - but obviously it's not what we're going
30:14 - for so paper right the the 50 mark the
30:18 - left position
30:19 - make it 38
30:20 - pixels so now they're going roughly the
30:22 - same you can see they're both
30:24 - they're off a little bit so maybe
30:26 - if i did this 35 pixels it's going to be
30:28 - the same distance so they're both going
30:29 - to move exactly the same
30:31 - way
30:33 - so now they're moving at exactly a
30:35 - uniform speed and distance and pace
30:38 - they're identical
30:39 - but if you want to give them a little
30:40 - bit more of a googly googly eye look you
30:43 - can have it move
30:44 - a little bit few more pixels so now they
30:46 - look a little bit
30:48 - you know a little bit more googly
30:49 - looking
30:52 - yeah
30:54 - interesting up to you however you want
30:56 - to do it you can even go something like
30:58 - this like top
31:00 - i don't know i don't know what's going
31:01 - to happen here what's the top uh the top
31:05 - by default for this is 25 pixels so
31:08 - maybe we move it to
31:11 - 20 pixels
31:13 - let's see what happens
31:15 - so that eyeball is like doing like a
31:17 - little
31:18 - it's kind of cool
31:21 - i'm gonna take that out okay save that
31:24 - and
31:25 - really
31:26 - refresh that's it
31:28 - so we have our pac-man
31:31 - chomping moving along the top the path
31:33 - going off screen coming back out from
31:35 - the beginning we have our blinky ghost
31:37 - all css flashing
31:40 - moving and his eyeballs are moving back
31:43 - and forth
31:44 - and that is really
31:47 - cool that's really quite something
31:49 - that's it for today this was a big
31:52 - lesson
31:53 - but i really enjoyed making this so i
31:55 - really wanted to give it the time of day
31:56 - so that you can
31:58 - create something really interesting show
32:00 - your friends show your mom and uh
32:03 - they'll really think you're cool that
32:04 - you spent a lot of time
32:07 - on your computer making pacman
32:09 - [Music]
32:14 - john
