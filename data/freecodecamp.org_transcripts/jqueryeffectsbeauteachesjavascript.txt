00:00 - in this video i'm going to talk about
00:02 - effects you can do in jquery we just
00:04 - have a few elements on the page i have
00:06 - an image an h1 tag and then a paragraph
00:10 - that you can see on the page there and
00:12 - i'm going to first talk about the hide
00:14 - event
00:16 - so we'll just type in the jquery
00:18 - selector and then we're just going to do
00:20 - a dot hide
00:22 - and that's it so if i run this code with
00:25 - just the image.hide it's going to hide
00:27 - the image the image just disappears you
00:29 - can see now it's like that image isn't
00:31 - even in the code there and if you need
00:34 - help adding jquery to your website you
00:36 - can check out my first video on jquery
00:38 - where i show you how to add jquery
00:41 - after you hide an element you can show
00:44 - the element so i just have to select it
00:46 - again
00:48 - and then just do dot show
00:50 - and now you're barely even going to be
00:52 - able to tell anything because it's going
00:53 - to hide it and then show it right away
00:55 - so hide and show just hides and show
00:58 - instantly but you can use animation in a
01:01 - couple of ways so you can pass in
01:04 - arguments to hide and show so it won't
01:06 - do it instantly i can pass in
01:09 - slow to make it a slow effect or fast
01:13 - to make a fast effect you can also use
01:16 - normal so let's see what that looks like
01:20 - see it disappeared slowly and then it
01:22 - came back quickly so instead of putting
01:25 - words slow and fast you can also put the
01:27 - number of milliseconds so i'm going to
01:29 - put 500 milliseconds to hide it that's a
01:32 - half a second and then 1 500
01:35 - milliseconds to show at 1.5 seconds so
01:37 - let's see what that looks like
01:41 - okay so you can really do any speed you
01:44 - want by just passing in a number like
01:46 - that and let's just see what that looks
01:47 - like if i do it on the h1 tag so here
01:50 - i'm going to change this to h1
01:52 - and let's try that
01:55 - so you can see it looks actually kind of
01:57 - different on the h1 so the show and hide
01:59 - effect use a combination of slide and
02:01 - fade effects with the the slide effect
02:04 - it's actually just changing the height
02:06 - really quickly so it's lowering the
02:08 - height and to zero and with an image
02:11 - when you lower the height it also
02:12 - automatically changes so it changes the
02:14 - width but with an h1 when you change the
02:16 - height it does not automatically change
02:18 - the width so that's why the h1 looked
02:20 - like it was just coming straight down
02:22 - and up and then the image looked like it
02:24 - was going into a little corner so show
02:26 - and hide used slide and fade at the same
02:29 - time but you can also use one or the
02:32 - other so instead of hide or show i'm
02:33 - going to use slide up
02:35 - or i can use slide down
02:39 - so now it's not going to change the
02:41 - opacity at all it's just going to slide
02:44 - up and down and you can still use the
02:45 - slow normal or fast or you can use
02:49 - specific number of milliseconds with
02:50 - this so let's see what that looks like
02:55 - and so it just slides up and down
02:58 - or you can use the fade out and fade in
03:01 - fade out
03:03 - and fade in
03:06 - and you can do a combination of the
03:08 - milliseconds and also i'm just going to
03:09 - put normal here
03:12 - for the amount of time
03:15 - so see it didn't slide at all just
03:17 - change the opacity another thing you can
03:20 - do is the toggle a toggle is just going
03:23 - to change the display based on the
03:25 - current visibility state so if it's
03:28 - currently hidden it will show the
03:30 - content if it's currently shown it will
03:32 - hide the content so we put toggle
03:35 - and this time i'm not going to pass in
03:37 - anything
03:38 - so if i toggle it it's just going to
03:42 - you can see really quick it went off
03:44 - and then came back on it came back on
03:46 - because of the fade in so toggle is just
03:49 - going to make it disappear if it's
03:50 - already appeared but you can also pass
03:52 - in speeds here so i'm going to pass in
03:54 - some milled seconds up at 700
03:56 - milliseconds let's see what happens now
04:00 - so it's going to hide
04:02 - and then fade in
04:04 - high so it's kind of weird that it's
04:06 - going up and then when you fade in it
04:08 - starts at full height and then
04:11 - the opacity goes 100
04:13 - but i can also put toggle here
04:18 - using toggle here is just like putting
04:20 - hide or show
04:22 - but it just does the opposite of
04:24 - whatever state it's currently in you can
04:26 - also do
04:27 - slide toggle or fade toggle so if it's
04:30 - slid down it will slide up if it's slid
04:33 - up it'll slide down or fade toggle if
04:35 - it's disappeared it will reappear if it
04:38 - is reappeared it will disappear
04:40 - okay now i want to talk about doing
04:42 - something after an animation completes
04:44 - so if we hide this element
04:46 - and then we're going to do a fade in
04:50 - so i'm going to fade in for a thousand
04:51 - milliseconds so
04:53 - nothing fancy here is just going to fade
04:54 - in just like that and now we're going to
04:56 - do a method chaining so if you do method
04:58 - chaining you can put in a lot of methods
05:00 - at the same time so i'm going to add a
05:02 - class
05:04 - blue
05:05 - now i'm going to quickly go up into the
05:07 - css here and for a class blue
05:10 - i'm going to change the background to
05:12 - blue
05:13 - and you'll see it's going to fade in and
05:15 - it's going to add the class blue so
05:16 - let's see what happens here
05:18 - and actually to make this
05:20 - more apparent i'm going to change the
05:22 - amount of time to 2000 milliseconds
05:27 - so you can see even though
05:30 - the fade in comes before the ag class
05:33 - they basically happen at the same time
05:35 - so this starts to fade in and then adds
05:37 - the class right away before the fade in
05:39 - is even done if you want to defer an
05:41 - action until after an animation has run
05:43 - to completion you need to use an
05:45 - animation callback function
05:47 - so
05:48 - you can put a callback function as the
05:50 - second argument passed any of the
05:52 - animation methods let me give you an
05:54 - example after the milliseconds i'm going
05:56 - to put a comma and now i'm going to put
05:58 - in the callback function
06:01 - let's see
06:05 - okay so now um we have this selector as
06:08 - this and this is just going to apply to
06:11 - what we're doing the animation on which
06:13 - is the h1 and now we're going to add the
06:15 - class blue so let's see what happens now
06:17 - run that
06:19 - so it fades in
06:20 - and then the background turns blue
06:23 - now one thing you can do is stop an
06:26 - animation so what i'm going to do here
06:32 - i'm going to attach a click event to the
06:35 - image the free code camp image and then
06:38 - in the function we're going to stop the
06:40 - animations
06:43 - we select the image tags and the on
06:45 - click will run this function where we
06:47 - select the h1 tag and do dot stop it's
06:50 - gonna stop the animation happening on
06:52 - the image so i'm gonna run this and
06:53 - while it's fading in i'm gonna press the
06:55 - image i just click the image and you can
06:57 - see it's slightly faded right now and it
07:00 - never add the class of blue
07:03 - so if i run
07:04 - this again you can see the full
07:05 - animation
07:08 - run it again and i'm going to click the
07:10 - image and it stops in the animation
07:12 - before it finishes it does not and it
07:14 - never gets the callback function so it
07:16 - never adds the class of blue the last
07:18 - thing i'm going to show in this video is
07:19 - the delay method so if you use delay
07:22 - it's going to introduce a delay between
07:24 - animations so let me show you an example
07:26 - of that
07:31 - so look at the paragraph at the bottom i
07:33 - know there's some other animations
07:34 - happening but when i run i get this
07:36 - again it's going to hide the paragraph
07:38 - for a half second and then it's going to
07:40 - delay for full seconds and then it's
07:42 - going to show for 0.3 seconds so those
07:45 - are the basics of javascript effects you
07:47 - can also do a few more custom effects
07:49 - with the dot animate method
07:51 - well thanks for watching my name is beau
