00:00 - hi i'm quincy larson i'm the teacher who
00:01 - founded free code camp five years ago
00:04 - and i am thrilled today to bring you
00:07 - this video it's very different from what
00:09 - we've been publishing on freecodecamp's
00:11 - youtube channel for the past five years
00:13 - we've been publishing in-depth tutorials
00:16 - and full courses on python java
00:21 - javascript
00:22 - kotlin a whole lot of different topics
00:24 - and we've also been covering important
00:26 - libraries like pytorch
00:28 - pygame tensorflow things like that so uh
00:33 - hang on mike i need to give my kid a
00:34 - little push
00:37 - hi quinn you ready
00:42 - higher lee
00:45 - all right i'm going to get back here
00:46 - where it's less windy so um
00:48 - we are going to be uh
00:51 - in this episode interviewing some of the
00:53 - most interesting people in open source
00:55 - that would be of course adam stokovic
00:57 - and jared santo from the legendary
01:01 - changelog podcast if you haven't heard
01:03 - the change log it is
01:05 - the
01:06 - preeminent podcast
01:08 - on open source software and
01:11 - pretty much every major open source
01:13 - maintainer has been on there at some
01:15 - point dan abramoff dhh yehuda katz
01:18 - and then of course a whole lot of
01:20 - maintainers you haven't heard of they
01:22 - have hundreds of episodes and this is
01:24 - their 10-year anniversary so
01:26 - uh i drove down to houston texas hung
01:29 - out with them in the studio and we
01:30 - recorded
01:31 - five hours of interviews okay i
01:33 - interviewed them for like two and a half
01:34 - three hours then they turned around and
01:36 - interviewed me for like an hour and a
01:37 - half
01:38 - all of that is going to be on this video
01:40 - i've added timestamps below
01:42 - so you can jump
01:43 - wherever you need to go
01:45 - in the video uh and just a quick heads
01:48 - up this is not a
01:50 - visually stunning video this is three
01:53 - people sitting in a studio
01:56 - talking into microphones
01:58 - i would encourage you to consider doing
02:01 - the dishes
02:02 - maybe uh going to the gym maybe
02:06 - driving to work doing other things while
02:08 - you watch this video because just
02:09 - sitting there staring at the three of us
02:11 - sit in our chairs for five hours
02:14 - would not be the best use of your time
02:16 - so
02:18 - listen to this in the background while
02:19 - you do other uh things that don't use
02:21 - your brain fully so you can still pay
02:23 - attention to the interview and um enjoy
02:26 - i think you're gonna learn a lot and i
02:28 - learned a lot about uh both adam and
02:30 - jared they had never done an interview
02:32 - like this where they talked about their
02:34 - background adam was in the military
02:36 - jared was like a recipient of several
02:39 - scholarships and he has some interesting
02:41 - stories behind that and that's how he
02:43 - was able to go to school and then just
02:45 - how they got into software development
02:46 - what kind of freelance projects they've
02:48 - been doing the story behind the
02:49 - changelog all this stuff it's so
02:50 - fascinating and uh so again
02:53 - enjoy the video and remember like after
02:55 - this we're gonna go straight back to
02:56 - publishing full-length courses uh this
02:59 - is just a one-time video so uh but i
03:02 - think you'll really enjoy it and have
03:04 - fun happy coding everybody
03:08 - hey welcome to the free code camp
03:09 - podcast we have a very special podcast
03:12 - today
03:13 - we are interviewing
03:15 - the founder of the changelog and his
03:18 - sidekick
03:19 - so i'm going to
03:21 - introduce them properly in a moment but
03:22 - i just want to welcome you this is a
03:24 - special episode of the freecodecamp
03:26 - podcast because we're technically on
03:27 - hiatus for the rest of the year while we
03:29 - handle a whole lot of other burning
03:30 - fires but i have been a huge
03:34 - fan of the change log ever since i
03:36 - started my developer journey back in the
03:39 - early 20 teens
03:41 - and
03:43 - this show has been a huge window into
03:45 - the world of open source development for
03:47 - me and i've learned so much
03:49 - from somebody the masters of open source
03:52 - development by listening to the
03:54 - changelog
03:55 - and
03:56 - today i am thrilled to
03:59 - flip it and ask a whole lot of questions
04:02 - to the creators of the show and
04:04 - celebrate their
04:05 - 10 year
04:07 - anniversary how many podcasts you know
04:09 - of that have not gone on to ten years
04:11 - not very many no
04:13 - all right so first uh adam stokovic the
04:16 - founder of the change log
04:18 - and the host for the past 10 years uh
04:20 - and jared santo who has stepped in and
04:24 - been a huge force in the change log
04:28 - over the past few years
04:29 - and we're going to learn a whole lot
04:31 - about them let's go
04:33 - first
04:34 - adam i just want to
04:36 - learn a little bit about you like sure
04:37 - what was your early life like adam
04:40 - you want to go back to like the
04:41 - beginning beginning like early life i
04:43 - mean like eight five what year if there
04:46 - were any really formative experiences in
04:48 - your childhood go for it but uh yeah
04:51 - i would say
04:53 - for me probably the one thing that
04:56 - wouldn't seem obvious is i grew up poor
05:00 - like
05:01 - from a town that
05:03 - people
05:04 - either go to jail
05:05 - become alcoholics
05:08 - you know just not a lot of hope and i
05:11 - came from a place where i would say that
05:13 - to be where i'm at today
05:15 - if people see me that i met and went to
05:18 - school with years and years ago just
05:19 - don't believe it you know
05:22 - um
05:23 - my dad died when i was really young so
05:25 - it was a big part of my life to have
05:27 - a father figure missing in my life
05:29 - my mom was amazing she uh she raised me
05:32 - my brother
05:33 - uh single mom you know and i love her
05:37 - she's uh she's since passed away in 2008
05:39 - but she was always my encourager always
05:42 - my believer in me
05:44 - and uh
05:45 - and quite honestly she's the reason why
05:48 - i'm at where i'm at because
05:50 - i guess ages ago when blogging was cool
05:52 - right back in like 2003 2004 cool right
05:55 - yeah when it became when it was the the
05:57 - era of blogging the vlogo sphere right
05:59 - yeah it's the blogosphere um
06:02 - i had a blog right and it was i didn't
06:05 - live right next to my mom anymore i had
06:07 - moved and was enough i was about five
06:09 - hours away so i had to have a blog to
06:12 - you know keep up with family it was
06:13 - where we posted our family pictures and
06:14 - just did whatever and i shared my
06:17 - thoughts and i got really into
06:19 - web design through wordpress and the
06:22 - theme kubrick if anybody remembers
06:24 - kubrick i do i work over here uh that
06:26 - was an entry point for me that's how i
06:27 - learned css by like looking at
06:30 - that css and be like what is margin what
06:32 - is padding all that stuff and so i got
06:34 - really curious about web design and you
06:36 - know just all that stuff and got really
06:38 - into it and then i got really busy at
06:40 - work and just sort of like didn't have
06:41 - enough time because it was just a hobby
06:43 - for me at the time
06:44 - and my mom's like you know you're not
06:46 - doing this anymore why not you know this
06:48 - and that and i'm like i just have time
06:49 - for it's no big deal whatever she's like
06:51 - but you're really good at it
06:53 - and like
06:54 - she's like you're really good at it you
06:56 - shouldn't stop you shouldn't quit you're
06:57 - really good at this you should find a
06:58 - way to do this more and you know it was
07:01 - literally that moment when she said that
07:03 - that i sort of internalized that as like
07:05 - huh okay mom says i should do it
07:08 - i should do it and literally if if she
07:10 - didn't say that
07:11 - and i know how silly blogging would have
07:13 - been at that that time it was not even a
07:15 - cool blog it was just yeah my family
07:17 - blog it was like nobody should ever read
07:19 - it not interesting thoughts at all but
07:21 - she's like you should keep doing this
07:23 - and that's
07:24 - that's probably one of the most
07:25 - formative things for me i would say to
07:27 - get me to hear there's a couple other
07:29 - things of course too but that
07:30 - specifically around web design web
07:32 - development and like pursuing it deeper
07:34 - was that moment
07:36 - yeah so
07:38 - you touched on the fact that you were
07:39 - working and you were working in another
07:41 - field and just pursuing software
07:43 - development
07:44 - as a
07:46 - passion
07:49 - let's back up a little bit to you know
07:51 - high school you're in this town where
07:53 - generally people don't go on to bright
07:55 - features
07:57 - how did you
07:58 - break out of that
08:01 - sheer luck
08:02 - sheer luck
08:04 - god's will
08:05 - um
08:07 - i would just say gosh man i just you
08:09 - know i look back on those times
08:12 - so i was the person that
08:14 - didn't have any money for college
08:17 - and my friends many of my close friends
08:19 - had some sort of
08:21 - plan because their parents were
08:23 - fortunate enough to have money the bank
08:25 - and make that plan for me i didn't have
08:27 - that plan i didn't even have great
08:29 - grades in high school i was terrible
08:31 - and not because i wasn't smart but
08:33 - because i just didn't have anybody
08:34 - really assigned for my mom and a couple
08:36 - others like really helped me to apply
08:38 - things and when i graduated high school
08:41 - i barely graduated it was terrible like
08:43 - i missed so many days of school the last
08:44 - year of my high school year like i just
08:46 - didn't want to be there anymore i wanted
08:47 - to move on to whatever was next
08:49 - and
08:51 - when i left high school this is like
08:52 - going super deep but when i left high
08:54 - school i i kind of told myself
08:57 - you know i need to make a plan and so
08:59 - the cool thing to say would be i'm
09:00 - taking a year off you know prior to
09:02 - going to college i just didn't have any
09:04 - money to go i didn't have a plan like
09:05 - how am i going to get there
09:07 - and so
09:08 - uh i spent the next year after high
09:11 - school sort of like
09:13 - making some sort of plan i worked at uh
09:16 - this place called reese brothers where
09:18 - they did telemarketing hey i was a
09:20 - telemarketer once at one point in my
09:21 - life i actually may have called you at
09:23 - one point to ask you about at t long
09:25 - distance it was probably like 10 cents
09:27 - or whatever and i can give you a great
09:28 - deal if you bought today hey that's how
09:30 - that worked uh but yeah i was a
09:32 - telemarketer
09:33 - got done with that and then i became a
09:35 - pizza guy
09:37 - i started to like toss pizzas and flip
09:39 - them and spin them there was a local
09:41 - mama pop
09:43 - local mom pop pizza joint what's it
09:45 - called
09:46 - i forget
09:48 - but it was amazing amazing they had this
09:50 - thing called a red top it's amazing
09:51 - pizza
09:53 - and then
09:54 - my roommate at the time because i'd
09:55 - moved out of my home and uh went and got
09:57 - an apartment with a buddy of mine and
09:59 - all that good stuff well he was in the
10:00 - national guard
10:02 - and i come from a family that has
10:04 - you know all of the all of the men in my
10:06 - family have all been in the military my
10:08 - dad my grandfathers my brother my uncles
10:12 - so it wasn't like this legacy thing but
10:14 - i was like hmm
10:16 - i gotta do something
10:18 - maybe i'll make enough money to buy a
10:19 - car i was really motivated by money in
10:21 - the car and like some sort of like uh
10:23 - money for college and so the sgli bill
10:25 - was an option then and so i was like
10:27 - well all right i'll go in the military
10:29 - so i went to the military full-time uh
10:31 - in 1998 and so i was in the army for
10:34 - three and a half years they had this
10:35 - special program where you can go into
10:38 - uh it was training plus three years or
10:40 - something like that and so i went in for
10:41 - training which was about six to eight
10:42 - months and then three years of service
10:45 - so it's around three and a half almost
10:47 - four years not quite four years so
10:48 - typically the term of service is four
10:50 - years that's why i'm making a big deal
10:51 - about it because anybody listening would
10:53 - be like i thought four years was the
10:54 - minimum well i kind of got off a little
10:57 - bit there by shaving a few months off
10:59 - but went to bosnia you know
11:02 - did all sorts of cool stuff in the in
11:04 - the army went over in europe
11:06 - uh
11:07 - gosh that's a lot of fun so i mean the
11:09 - military jared knows i've told jared
11:11 - this story at least but the military for
11:13 - me was
11:14 - um there was a moment when i was in this
11:17 - thing called ait advanced individual
11:19 - training everything in the military is
11:20 - an acronym so there's always like
11:22 - something you know you got
11:24 - art you know ucmj you know that's the
11:27 - the rule set essentially the the
11:29 - government for lack of better terms the
11:30 - the laws
11:32 - um
11:33 - what am i getting at so when i was in
11:35 - eit the drill sergeant like i was just i
11:37 - was even though i went in the military i
11:38 - was trying to like do something i didn't
11:40 - really apply myself to be the best
11:43 - soldier i was still sort of like
11:44 - figuring it out and i wasn't doing a
11:46 - great job i was
11:48 - late not prepared not the best at
11:50 - physical fitness you know so i was like
11:53 - the lower echelon of soldier and so one
11:56 - day
11:56 - i'm standing in the in the third uh the
11:59 - third line of formation and the drill
12:01 - sergeant says stokoviak front center
12:04 - your first squad leader now and so that
12:06 - means that you're now
12:07 - the leader of the first squad and
12:09 - there's like usually like you know three
12:11 - or four squads so like three different
12:12 - lines so if you think of a formation
12:13 - it's the rows or squads and so if you're
12:16 - on the if you're on the
12:18 - the if you're facing the formation on
12:20 - the far left side that's the first
12:21 - person and that's the person that's in
12:23 - charge of that squad so i got i got
12:25 - basically made under the person who is
12:27 - in charge of the unit i was the second
12:30 - income command for lack of it better
12:31 - terms and i didn't do anything to
12:33 - deserve it or earn it he just gave it to
12:35 - me
12:36 - and uh and like from that day on i was
12:39 - like i'm a leader now i have to be a
12:42 - leader how do i be a leader how do i
12:44 - lead how do i
12:45 - what's it look like what does a leader
12:47 - look like how do they talk how do they
12:48 - walk how do they act
12:51 - and so it sort of reshaped my formation
12:53 - of what it meant to lead i started to
12:55 - uh you know press my uniform shine my
12:58 - boots you know they call it dress right
13:00 - dress in the military be very you know
13:03 - you know all the angles are squared and
13:06 - whatnot so
13:07 - i just
13:08 - i just i guess i was given an
13:10 - opportunity to lead which is why i'm a
13:11 - huge advocate for
13:13 - you know just helping somebody that
13:15 - doesn't even think they deserve it or
13:17 - know how to do it give them a chance you
13:19 - know encourage them into a leadership
13:21 - position
13:22 - and uh
13:23 - i was not the best i probably failed a
13:25 - lot
13:26 - and that didn't matter though because
13:28 - because
13:29 - where i'm at today as a man as a dad as
13:31 - a father
13:32 - as a leader of any sort is because of
13:35 - some of those moments
13:36 - we must have seen a lot in you if he
13:38 - gave you that responsibility so it's
13:40 - possible that i don't think he did
13:42 - honestly
13:43 - i don't think he did i i don't think i
13:46 - deserved it at all he wasn't like oh he
13:48 - looks good let's get him up here i think
13:49 - he was just like rando and i was just
13:51 - having a draw and i think i was telling
13:53 - jared this story of the day like he's
13:54 - like would you would you say would you
13:57 - would you thank him today or something
13:58 - like that yeah well we were talking
14:00 - about people who influenced us in our
14:01 - lives and the question is should you go
14:03 - back to that person because you don't
14:05 - you don't appreciate it then i mean
14:07 - sometimes you do but especially as a
14:08 - young person we just don't appreciate
14:10 - what we have
14:11 - the opportunity is given to us and the
14:12 - question is well now that we have we
14:14 - look back and i say we're talking about
14:15 - a teacher of mine shout out to mr kasner
14:18 - in uh
14:19 - high school there he is a guy who like i
14:21 - was like wow i didn't realize it but
14:22 - you're he was a good teacher and he
14:24 - impressed things upon me
14:26 - and the question was well would you go
14:27 - back to that person if you could and
14:28 - just thank them
14:30 - because now you have that appreciation
14:32 - and that was what i was asking you and i
14:34 - would and i was like well you know what
14:36 - i did today i was googling
14:38 - drill sergeant hillard you know the
14:40 - person's name that that did this
14:43 - and i was like what's what's really
14:45 - interesting as somebody in that position
14:47 - he probably has no idea he changed my
14:49 - life
14:50 - and i mean like yeah this these things
14:52 - happen out there
14:54 - that we don't get that feedback loop
14:55 - like as software developers and people
14:57 - who you know deal with teams and flows
15:00 - and frameworks and systems we we crave
15:02 - that feedback loop and it's a
15:05 - it's a
15:06 - built-in mechanism into the human brain
15:08 - to desire and need that feedback loop
15:10 - right to have relationship is a key
15:13 - humanistic feedback loop
15:15 - find a human in solitary confinement
15:17 - whether they're in the you know in the
15:19 - caves or in you know
15:22 - um
15:23 - in prison or something like that
15:25 - you find somebody super alone you're
15:27 - going to find somebody seriously dealing
15:28 - with some mental issues because of that
15:30 - solitary that because of that that
15:32 - soleness
15:33 - and uh
15:35 - yeah i don't think he he has any any
15:37 - idea that uh he influenced my life so
15:39 - well
15:40 - which is crazy
15:42 - to me
15:43 - yeah the the feedback loop
15:46 - is very loose in the real world
15:48 - especially among i mean who knows were
15:50 - you able to find him on google are there
15:52 - so many
15:56 - as a matter of fact i kind of got scared
15:57 - for a second because i did find an
15:58 - article from the base i was at that was
16:01 - tragic and i started reading through it
16:03 - and thank god his name wasn't in it it
16:05 - was something else
16:07 - you know sad about the situation but i
16:08 - was like gosh here i am looking for this
16:10 - person and something bad happened to
16:12 - them or whatever you know you find
16:14 - somebody's obituary you know and it's
16:16 - kind of terrible too because like if
16:18 - you're out there and you're listening to
16:19 - this you're thinking man there's
16:20 - somebody who influenced my life
16:22 - try to thank them if you can because
16:25 - i mean the last thing i would want is to
16:27 - find that person's obituary and it'd be
16:28 - too late you know if i could find them
16:32 - somehow some way i would be like thank
16:34 - you so much for
16:36 - sharing leadership with a crap soldier
16:39 - like me because wow it changed my life
16:42 - it's a great reminder i'm gonna have to
16:43 - put that on my to list because i've got
16:45 - a lot of people myself
16:47 - who have steered me in the direction a
16:49 - lot of teachers
16:51 - a lot of employers and managers yeah um
16:54 - so you get back from the army you did
16:57 - your three years and and your uh
16:59 - your education before that
17:01 - um did you end up going to school or
17:03 - what did you do from there that's funny
17:05 - um
17:06 - so that's actually the next part that
17:08 - got me to where i'm at closer to today i
17:10 - was i would say at least so here
17:12 - specifically geographically in texas
17:14 - so um
17:16 - for a little while there i lived in
17:18 - canada
17:20 - and that's a really long story and i
17:22 - don't feel like going into that but
17:24 - i went from the military to florida
17:26 - because a good friend of mine that i
17:27 - grew up and went to high school
17:29 - this is one of the people who had a plan
17:30 - had parents with money and they sent
17:32 - them to college to school
17:34 - and so instead of going to school i went
17:36 - to the military this person my good
17:37 - buddy uh donald kilgore you know donald
17:39 - yeah we work with dk quite a bit he uh
17:43 - he went to film school in orlando
17:45 - florida at a place called full sail
17:47 - really well known for audio visual
17:49 - directing film all that good stuff and
17:51 - so i left the military with like this
17:53 - sgli bill thinking i'm gonna go to
17:55 - florida and i'm gonna go to film school
17:56 - i'm gonna go to audio school so i i'd
17:58 - wanted to do either directing of films
18:01 - or getting to like audio stuff around
18:04 - films i loved it i didn't know how to do
18:07 - it but i like the idea of it which is so
18:09 - ironic of what i do now
18:11 - at least one component of my job and uh
18:15 - yeah i never went to school
18:16 - i never went i never ended up making it
18:18 - there which is kind of an interesting
18:20 - story if you want to go there i can i
18:21 - can take it to like the next
18:23 - i would say if we had to like
18:25 - uh fasted my skill set one of my biggest
18:28 - skill sets is sales and just
18:30 - relationships and partnerships i love
18:32 - that kind of stuff
18:33 - and i'd mentioned
18:35 - uh reece brothers and
18:38 - doing telemarketing well i'd always been
18:42 - i'd always like to help people and so i
18:44 - think when when you say well sales is
18:46 - really just trying to help people solve
18:47 - their problems it's not about getting
18:49 - jared to buy something he don't want to
18:50 - buy
18:51 - with money he don't have you know it's
18:53 - it's about he has a problem i can help
18:56 - solve that problem that's sales to me
18:58 - and that's what we do we solve people's
18:59 - problems in a lot of ways
19:01 - and so
19:02 - um
19:04 - i uh
19:07 - kind of a long story about i'll make it
19:08 - really short i had a friend who was
19:10 - trying to be a dj
19:12 - and we were at
19:14 - uh a club
19:15 - early in the day kind of like seven
19:17 - o'clock
19:18 - times people are into the club you know
19:20 - it's not the time you want to be a dj
19:22 - and so we were there i see him talking
19:24 - to this guy at the bar i see him go back
19:26 - and do his thing and i go over and
19:27 - introduce myself because i'm i'm like if
19:29 - you're a friend of my friend you're a
19:31 - friend of mine kind of kind of person
19:33 - and so i went over and i introduced
19:34 - myself as hey i saw you talking to my
19:35 - buddy dion my name is adam etcetera or
19:38 - whatever and
19:40 - long story short this person's name was
19:41 - sean hughes another person that i would
19:43 - love to see again and thank
19:45 - uh because that day he was i was at a
19:47 - crossroads of like what i was doing
19:49 - which was basically nothing i had no
19:51 - real ambition at the time
19:53 - i was like i'm really hating what i'm
19:54 - doing now i'm thinking about getting the
19:55 - car sales
19:56 - so car sales right i love selling hey
19:59 - people need cars i can help you solve
20:01 - your problem by getting a great car
20:02 - whatever but car sales is generally
20:05 - not the most fun sales job it's got a
20:08 - lot of
20:09 - just a lot of achiness to it so yeah you
20:11 - know
20:11 - it doesn't have a great uh
20:13 - a great reputation for being a great job
20:16 - you can make a lot of money but it may
20:18 - not be the best job for you and so long
20:19 - story short i meet sean he's like don't
20:21 - get into car sales i've been in the car
20:22 - sales it's terrible don't do that i tell
20:24 - you what
20:25 - come in on monday this is friday come in
20:28 - on monday to my office
20:30 - he's selling a great
20:32 - young man got a great head on your
20:33 - shoulders i got something i'm working on
20:36 - at a company called muzak i'd love to
20:38 - interview you for this thing we have
20:40 - going on
20:41 - so that's another like huge moment my
20:43 - life where i went from like no direction
20:46 - to direction
20:47 - i go in on monday meet with sean it's a
20:50 - great office it's a legit job or you
20:52 - gotta dress nice right and you get a
20:54 - computer like you know to be like i'm
20:56 - not talking to a pos which is a point of
20:58 - sale system or you know which is nothing
21:01 - wrong with that it was just the next
21:02 - direction for me
21:04 - um because at the time i was i was a
21:06 - server i was serving you know waiting
21:08 - tables doing that kind of stuff in
21:09 - orlando making good money because lots
21:12 - of
21:12 - hospitality around that area but yeah
21:16 - this guy man hired me into this position
21:18 - it was an lapd program called leads
21:20 - appointments deals proposals so more
21:23 - acronyms not in the military this time
21:25 - but leads appointments deals proposals
21:27 - that's what it was all about i was
21:28 - basically inside sales for account
21:31 - executives
21:32 - and i learned the ropes of this business
21:34 - if you haven't heard of muzak if you've
21:36 - been into say old navy or banana
21:38 - republic or any sort of like upscale
21:41 - retail environment they put the sound
21:43 - systems in they put the music in and
21:45 - that's what i learned how to do like
21:47 - this sort of like um
21:50 - a soundtrack to evoke an emotion right i
21:52 - started getting into user experience
21:54 - this whole aspect of design and stuff
21:55 - like that music had a really good brand
21:57 - design i always thought it was elevators
22:00 - that's where it began okay so it began
22:02 - in like the early 1920s gotcha as a
22:06 - combination of music and kodak because
22:08 - the person who founded muzak
22:11 - it was a whole different era but he
22:13 - loved the he loved he loved music and he
22:15 - loved kodak
22:17 - so he just put them together
22:18 - music there you go not the silliest
22:21 - uh company name origin sorry yeah you
22:23 - could do worse you could do worse and so
22:26 - you know i got into sales there i
22:28 - started making good money
22:30 - and uh
22:31 - yeah that's that's i never made it to
22:33 - school though so the interesting to
22:35 - answer sort of a long-winded version of
22:37 - like did you go to school the answer is
22:39 - no but i found a really awesome job that
22:41 - helped me learn all sorts of skill sets
22:43 - that i literally use today yeah to help
22:45 - build our business
22:47 - yeah and i guess to some extent like
22:48 - they used to say going to the military
22:50 - was like an alternative to going to
22:52 - school because you learn a lot of the
22:52 - same things right you learn how to uh
22:55 - structure how to operate and structure
22:57 - and everything
22:58 - um and by the time you'd already
23:00 - traveled around the world and done a lot
23:02 - of things to expand your horizons anyway
23:03 - yeah i'd seen i was used to traveling i
23:05 - was used to being
23:07 - a vagabond for lack of better terms you
23:08 - know just pack a bag and go somewhere or
23:10 - take a few things only
23:12 - very i've slept in some really weird
23:15 - places and i've also showered
23:18 - and not showered in some really weird
23:20 - places so i've actually the longest
23:23 - stretch i've gone for not showering is
23:24 - about three and a half weeks what wow we
23:27 - were on a field problem and you were
23:29 - lucky it was just like a certain kind of
23:30 - field problem where we had to it was
23:32 - simulating
23:33 - a real world in-battle environment kind
23:36 - of thing
23:37 - and we were learning because we're going
23:38 - to bosnians we had to train so when you
23:40 - go in the military you just don't know
23:41 - how to be a soldier and how to do these
23:43 - things and go overseas and do different
23:45 - stuff you have to train to do these
23:47 - things so we went to
23:49 - training to learn how to you know go
23:51 - overseas and kind of simulate that now i
23:53 - showered over there which is
23:55 - awesome
23:56 - but during this what they call them
23:57 - field problems during this field problem
24:00 - yeah i didn't shower i mean
24:03 - a wash rag to myself maybe a little bit
24:05 - like a legit in the shower shower
24:09 - i might be pushing a little bit at least
24:10 - two weeks maybe three weeks yeah and i
24:13 - don't know if i could do it like it was
24:14 - tough i'd be knocking myself over every
24:16 - time i lifted my arm everybody smelled
24:18 - yeah i was gonna ask if it wraps around
24:20 - like it's bad for a while but eventually
24:21 - you just kind of get used to it it goes
24:23 - back to normal yeah it's kind of like uh
24:25 - yeah after a while
24:26 - it just sort of like normalizes i will
24:29 - say that when the field problem is over
24:31 - and we all got back to the barracks
24:32 - the first few in that immediately went
24:35 - and showered
24:36 - came out from their shower and then
24:37 - everybody else is still coming in you're
24:38 - like oh my gosh you guys smell so bad
24:41 - like it was it was pretty bad at that
24:43 - point you can smell the difference
24:44 - and the line for that shower must have
24:46 - been like tightly packed everybody's
24:48 - like anticipating the hot water yeah
24:50 - yeah this
24:52 - i may forget that i don't really know
24:54 - but i'm sure you blocked it out there's
24:56 - always a line it's like a line to
24:58 - brush your teeth even yes yeah yeah
25:02 - so
25:03 - how did you transition from
25:05 - doing sales for music and you said doing
25:07 - some some kind of in the direction of
25:10 - user experience design yeah choosing
25:12 - music and and trying to evoke specific
25:15 - emotions and communicate certain things
25:17 - how did you
25:18 - explain the process of transitioning
25:20 - from that to getting more and more
25:22 - passionate about tech and ultimately
25:24 - um doing what you're doing now yeah it's
25:26 - it's interesting that uh
25:28 - one of the things that made me realize i
25:30 - was more geeky than i'd ever thought i
25:32 - was because i was never like i guess
25:34 - just when i grew up computers weren't
25:37 - around everywhere to sort of like easily
25:39 - stumble into or more easily get into you
25:42 - know and so you almost had to really try
25:44 - and so at the the first time i had a
25:46 - phone
25:47 - was at this job
25:48 - they gave me a cell phone it was next
25:50 - tell that told how long ago it was it
25:52 - was a next telephone
25:53 - phone a next telephone it was crazy and
25:56 - the very first time i had my own laptop
25:58 - was at this job the ver the first time i
26:01 - like really used a computer for anything
26:03 - that was
26:04 - not like online chats or just whatever
26:07 - dinking around
26:08 - was at this job so i'd kind of gotten
26:11 - into there's a uh i don't know if it's
26:14 - still around but it was called act and
26:15 - act database it was like a maybe you
26:17 - know this you've seen it jared but it
26:19 - was a databasing system for like a basic
26:21 - crm
26:22 - and that i started to tinker with that i
26:24 - was never really good at it but i
26:25 - started taking some classes around it
26:26 - and just realized that i had this
26:29 - sort of inkling into like a geek or what
26:31 - i considered a geek at that time geeky
26:34 - things you know and uh muzak had a
26:36 - really interesting brand a really clean
26:38 - design a really uh a real focus on
26:42 - uh how they say things and it's funny
26:44 - one thing we actually have that's
26:46 - a behind the scenes repo on github it's
26:48 - it's a a repo we call one voice so that
26:51 - jared and i can sort of like say the
26:53 - same things and sort of define the same
26:55 - things around our business to say when
26:57 - we talk to somebody around
26:59 - a partnership or a sales opportunity or
27:02 - you know our guest guide various things
27:04 - are in this so that jared and i can have
27:06 - you know and begin to develop one voice
27:08 - for whomever sort of leads commands and
27:10 - interacts with you know these levels of
27:13 - our our business
27:14 - and so that's something that they had
27:16 - they actually had this entire book
27:17 - called one voice and i was like that's
27:19 - really interesting how much you think
27:20 - about
27:22 - uh the emotion that you want to invoke
27:25 - as a part of your brand you know who you
27:27 - say you are really mattered to music
27:30 - and they could have just been they had
27:31 - some really good branding people right
27:33 - and people believed in it but hey i
27:35 - drank the kool-aid man i was all in it
27:36 - so that that's kind of what got me into
27:38 - it but
27:39 - um
27:41 - i'd actually
27:42 - i mentioned at some point i moved to
27:44 - canada
27:45 - uh i moved to canada uh as part of my
27:48 - job and they had an affiliate there and
27:50 - i was working in canada
27:52 - and uh long story short this is when
27:55 - george bush was president
27:58 - the americans did not have a great
27:59 - reputation abroad whether it was canada
28:02 - europe wherever else at least from from
28:05 - my perspective because
28:06 - people would not buy from me because i
28:08 - was an american right so i like was an
28:10 - amazing salesperson killing it like i
28:13 - think at age 21 when i was working at
28:15 - muzak in the united states i was making
28:18 - like 80 90k a year
28:20 - in sales like
28:22 - i was just doing it for like full-time
28:23 - sales for like less than a year almost
28:26 - barely two years if that so i was really
28:28 - killing it i was like
28:29 - top five in the country
28:32 - for you yeah and then going there and
28:34 - it's nothing against canadians but i i
28:36 - was i i felt really
28:38 - um
28:40 - i don't know how to describe it i just
28:42 - felt i i just felt like really sad that
28:44 - that these people would not buy for me
28:46 - because
28:47 - of where i'm from and because i have an
28:49 - american accent and i'm not canadian and
28:51 - don't say hey i love canadians they're
28:53 - amazing
28:54 - and i was like okay i just can't make
28:56 - ends meet so long story short i i went
28:58 - there
28:59 - to to work for this company there and i
29:00 - just couldn't cut it and so i knew
29:02 - somebody who who ran this it business
29:04 - which is really where my
29:06 - story of technology and like true web
29:09 - and software and stuff became a thing
29:11 - and like networking because this
29:12 - business was called it weapons
29:14 - they were
29:16 - i.t
29:17 - weapons you get it right okay
29:20 - it was pretty cool
29:21 - it was pretty cool they did citrix they
29:23 - did vmware they did like watch uh watch
29:26 - guard like so they did hardware and
29:28 - software they would do large scale
29:30 - citrix implementations and this is when
29:32 - it was all about uh
29:34 - thin client fat
29:36 - what's the other server yeah like the
29:39 - you did all of it on servers so citrix
29:41 - was like you know you had a thin client
29:42 - that was you know kind of stupid and all
29:44 - that was just a terminal to right your
29:45 - server and so everything was server
29:47 - based and it's just an interesting area
29:49 - this is around
29:51 - 2003 2004 2005 time frame so that's kind
29:55 - of the error then
29:57 - i learned about servers what they were
29:59 - all that good stuff and it's it's just
30:01 - pretty crazy to think like
30:03 - this job at it weapons started to open
30:04 - up doors into into software hardware
30:06 - technology and
30:09 - at one point
30:10 - i didn't even know what a server was
30:11 - like i hear it i hear people say server
30:14 - but like
30:15 - what's a server
30:16 - so
30:17 - so ultimately of course you went on to
30:20 - found one of the most important uh
30:23 - podcasts about software in my opinion
30:26 - and yet you were working in sales
30:29 - yeah there must have been a pretty big
30:31 - transition there yeah just just give us
30:33 - some broad strokes about how how you
30:35 - went about getting more technical this
30:36 - was kind of interesting too because i i
30:38 - kind of
30:39 - stumbled into it right like when i was
30:41 - working at i.t weapons i was
30:44 - learning more i was starting to take
30:45 - over the website for it weapons and i
30:47 - was starting to deploy it and stuff like
30:48 - that which was like basically just
30:50 - dragging and dropping an ftp it was
30:52 - really you know it was those days kind
30:54 - of thing it was a self-built php kind of
30:57 - just a rendering kind of situation so it
30:59 - was really interesting that that's like
31:01 - how much things have changed um
31:05 - i started getting more and more
31:06 - responsibility there around that kind of
31:08 - stuff and sort of like defining where
31:10 - the brand went how we spoke uh we would
31:13 - have in office um
31:16 - kind of like conferences for lack of
31:17 - better terms where i would organize them
31:18 - i would like get the people there to
31:20 - speak from citrix from watchguard from
31:23 - you know from vmware or whatever and i
31:25 - would coordinate people and i would
31:26 - coordinate the clients and just kind of
31:28 - like start layering on all these
31:29 - different things of like biz dev design
31:33 - sales
31:34 - you know all that kind of stuff
31:36 - and then a buddy of mine which
31:38 - ultimately came here to texas i was in
31:40 - canada a buddy of mine started reaching
31:42 - out to me about like
31:43 - i don't know why he asked me these
31:45 - things but like he's like hey i got this
31:47 - issue with this webpage i'm making can
31:49 - you help me and i just started to solve
31:50 - his problems and he's like hey can you
31:53 - just build these things for me i've got
31:54 - some clients and like so next thing you
31:56 - know i started to just like moonlight
31:58 - and freelance in web design
32:00 - and developments i would design it i
32:02 - would develop it i would ship it i would
32:04 - support it and i would help you know to
32:07 - some degree even land the deals you know
32:08 - so sort of like full full spectrum of
32:11 - like identify people to work with
32:14 - understand what their problem set was
32:15 - design something to fit it and then
32:17 - build it and make it and ship it and
32:18 - support it
32:19 - and
32:20 - after a while he was like do you just
32:22 - want to because he's a good buddy of
32:23 - mine i grew up with him i was kind of
32:24 - telling you that some of my friends had
32:26 - plans he was the one that had a plan
32:28 - went to school
32:29 - and he was the one that went the full
32:30 - sale his name is donald kilgore love
32:32 - donald
32:34 - he's like you just want to like become a
32:36 - partner in my business and help me do
32:37 - this and so we did started landing some
32:39 - really big clients i think probably the
32:42 - biggest deal we landed
32:44 - was like
32:45 - twenty or thirty thousand dollars and i
32:47 - was like for a website that was a big
32:49 - deal it was an rv dealership here in
32:51 - texas called demontron they're really
32:53 - well known around here they have
32:55 - chrysler jeep ford whatever and they
32:58 - have an rv place and so we built out and
33:00 - this is actually leading into rails too
33:02 - because this is like 2005.
33:05 - david had recently just said whoops and
33:07 - we were all watching you know i'm saying
33:09 - right right david had him on our hands
33:10 - that's right david hartman video details
33:13 - vlogging in five minutes yeah
33:15 - and so we had we had built this version
33:17 - of uh
33:19 - of de montron and we didn't really like
33:21 - how it was functionality and so that's
33:23 - when rails was really cool i started
33:25 - getting into that more i reached out to
33:27 - some people and kind of put together a
33:29 - team i was on the front end and they
33:31 - were building up the back end we built
33:33 - out this really awesome site in rails
33:36 - and i think i just kind of stumbled into
33:38 - it because i wasn't trying to be even
33:40 - though i know i said my mom said i'm
33:42 - really good at it i wasn't really
33:43 - thinking i would be a web developer i
33:45 - kind of like just was doing it was into
33:48 - like biz dev i really like to create and
33:50 - develop relationships and i just see
33:52 - that as like one more way to do it
33:53 - because one i could do it well no one
33:56 - else was really doing it i had an
33:57 - opportunity i can cultivate clients i
34:00 - can do a lot of these interesting things
34:01 - and
34:02 - the door just opened up yeah and i
34:04 - imagine a lot of the job was
34:07 - communicating with the clients and
34:09 - understanding their needs and you know
34:11 - you've got to watch out for hours even
34:13 - like like on the phone for hours talking
34:16 - through things and
34:17 - figuring things out and and a lot of
34:19 - iteration a lot of feedback from them so
34:21 - it's really fun so would you say rails
34:23 - was one of the key
34:25 - inspirations for you starting a podcast
34:28 - around open source i mean rails is one
34:30 - of the most important open source
34:32 - projects it's brought so many people
34:33 - into the fields
34:35 - it revolutionized yeah a lot of uh crud
34:37 - based web apps were built for sure so a
34:40 - little piece of the history is so the
34:41 - person that i hired
34:43 - to work with me on the rail site his
34:44 - name is josh owens he's pretty prominent
34:46 - in the javascript and i believe like
34:48 - meteor space now
34:50 - um i think he still lives in in
34:53 - ohio i can't recall maybe columbus area
34:56 - um
34:58 - he had a podcast
35:00 - that began in 2004 called the web 2.0
35:03 - show so i don't know if you know this
35:05 - quincy but at one point the web was just
35:07 - 1.0
35:08 - and then then it became 2.0 and that
35:11 - just meant that we had gradients and
35:12 - like rounded corners what version are we
35:14 - on at this point who knows you know yeah
35:18 - who knows don't use an html5 and css3
35:21 - right there you go that's right and so
35:23 - he had a show a podcast called the web
35:25 - 2.0 show it was one of the very
35:27 - earliest first technical or tech or
35:31 - software focus podcast and at that time
35:33 - you didn't have to do much because you
35:35 - just had to be a podcast you could be
35:36 - terrible quality sound wise great
35:38 - content it didn't matter you had all the
35:40 - listeners because
35:41 - there was no one else doing it and so
35:43 - his partner had quit and this is how i
35:45 - got into podcasting and
35:47 - more specifically how i got into like
35:48 - talking to people that weren't just like
35:51 - my buddies nearby
35:53 - about software technical related things
35:55 - and so i became his uh his co-host
35:59 - i think in like late 2005 early 2006. i
36:02 - literally been podcasting since like
36:03 - 2005. i can say 2005 because at least
36:06 - like november 2005 not all the whole
36:08 - year but i can claim 2005. yeah wow so
36:11 - you were on the ground floor yeah
36:12 - podcasting as a
36:14 - medium yeah yeah i mean
36:17 - in a lot of ways i mean i can remember
36:18 - using a really crappy
36:21 - uh snowball it was like a white
36:22 - microphone it was crappy to me because
36:24 - you can see the mics we're using now and
36:26 - over time i had to learn about audio too
36:28 - things that i never even really cared to
36:29 - learn about that you sort of had to
36:32 - had to be forced to learn these things
36:34 - just by way of producing audio and
36:38 - now
36:39 - you have to deliver a show that sounds
36:42 - really good we used to get away with it
36:44 - before we can like not that we wanted to
36:46 - but we could ship something to our
36:48 - listeners that wasn't
36:49 - immaculate sound quality you know but
36:51 - now we kind of feel like we're because
36:54 - of what listeners desire and demand and
36:56 - because so many people are doing it well
36:57 - and it's also a lot easier to produce it
36:59 - well
37:00 - you know now we i couldn't think of like
37:02 - shipping like if you go back and listen
37:03 - to the web 2.0 show you'll hear what i'm
37:05 - talking about
37:07 - yeah yeah even even some of the earlier
37:09 - episodes of the changelog listening to
37:11 - them i mean there's it's just night and
37:12 - day yeah today in the production quality
37:14 - it's it's funny you go back and listen
37:16 - to episode number one
37:18 - and then even go from one to just 100
37:21 - just go on the on the hundreds go to one
37:23 - 100 200 and 300 what would like 367 will
37:27 - ship this week i believe
37:29 - so yeah
37:31 - the way the way the change all came
37:32 - about was was uh i was working with a
37:35 - buddy named netherland and when
37:38 - netherland win netherland kind of like
37:41 - the netherlands but netherland
37:43 - and uh i think he used to say that too
37:46 - uh
37:47 - he goes by penguin p-e-n-g-w-y-n
37:50 - on on twitter to look him up but uh
37:53 - he was at an interesting space because
37:55 - he ran a consultancy
37:57 - uh called squeegee now wins got some
37:59 - really interesting witty humor so it was
38:01 - called squeegee because he liked to like
38:03 - clean things and make things nice
38:05 - and their brand was
38:06 - like a lot like you might imagine like
38:10 - a cleaning products brand so like kind
38:11 - of like [ __ ] and shiny and it was
38:13 - really interesting i loved uh i love
38:15 - that aspect about it but he was in this
38:16 - crossroads because he had just decided
38:18 - to leave his consultancy and sort of
38:20 - like go a new direction
38:22 - and so did i
38:24 - and so we were sort of both in this sort
38:26 - of like let's establish our name for
38:28 - ourselves let's kind of like you know
38:29 - etch out some new territory and
38:31 - obviously i had a background in at least
38:33 - doing something with podcasting and
38:35 - stuff like talking about things
38:37 - and i was like what if
38:39 - we were both talking about how fast open
38:40 - source is moving
38:42 - and i'm like you know what people just
38:43 - need is they just need like a
38:45 - a way finder through the version so if
38:48 - something changes
38:49 - if you know rails 1.0 versus 1.8 or
38:52 - whatever it might be you know somebody
38:54 - just needs to sort of like chronicle
38:56 - the change log of a of a of a software
38:59 - product or software open source whatever
39:01 - like someone needs to sort of like tell
39:02 - that story that's what what's missing
39:04 - what happened here and what happened
39:06 - here and what's happening between
39:08 - people don't have that
39:10 - and so i was like what if we just did a
39:11 - show called changelog so it was just
39:14 - changed like a first and one was like
39:16 - what about
39:17 - the change law
39:19 - this is like the opposite of the
39:21 - facebook facebook that's right change
39:22 - log 2 the change log sounds more
39:25 - definitive yeah and so we were the
39:27 - change log and as a matter of fact
39:30 - it's really funny because it began as
39:32 - we still own these domains yeah when did
39:33 - you get changelog.com because that's a
39:34 - really good domain yeah it took it took
39:36 - a couple years and it wasn't very
39:38 - expensive there's a story behind that it
39:39 - had the changelog.com yeah it began it's
39:42 - changelogshow.com and that was actually
39:44 - what our original
39:45 - uh google account was set up under our
39:47 - email was actually adam at changelog
39:50 - show and then we aliased the
39:52 - changelog.com and then eventually i'm
39:54 - like you know what we just need to
39:55 - shorten it to just change log
39:57 - on twitter and wherever we can and so
40:00 - we only really did that because they
40:01 - became available to us somebody
40:03 - uh on twitter gave that handle to us
40:06 - thank you i can't recall your name but
40:07 - we wrote about this it's never heard
40:09 - about somebody on twitter actually
40:10 - responding did they just voluntarily or
40:12 - they just gave it to us yeah they were
40:14 - they were in software and said they
40:15 - liked what we're doing they're like i
40:17 - see that you're going to use it for good
40:18 - things it's not like you just want it
40:19 - because you're some jerk or whatever and
40:21 - so they knew we had good intentions um
40:25 - changelot.com was owned by somebody else
40:28 - in software
40:29 - and they
40:31 - i don't think they were really
40:32 - interested in selling it until i made
40:33 - him an offer and then he agreed to it we
40:36 - go we got chainsaw.com for a thousand
40:38 - dollars wow a thousand dollars yeah what
40:40 - year was that
40:42 - uh i want to say like 2015 maybe not
40:45 - that long ago yeah maybe 2014.
40:47 - man what 2014. these are some really
40:49 - chill people because i mean that's a
40:51 - great deal yeah he could have he could
40:53 - have seen like well the writings on the
40:54 - wall you've been doing this for a while
40:55 - you're probably going to keep doing this
40:56 - you're you know
40:57 - i want more than a thousand bucks but
40:59 - it sounds like he believed in the
41:01 - mission if you want to give you that
41:02 - kind of price yeah
41:04 - i don't think he believed in the mission
41:06 - i i think he just saw us as
41:08 - someone who could do something with it
41:10 - that wasn't just
41:12 - i guess i don't know just something
41:14 - useful
41:15 - and
41:15 - we were willing to give him what what he
41:17 - desired which was a thousand bucks and
41:19 - we ended up using cdu s-e-d-o to do the
41:23 - sort of the whole
41:24 - um
41:25 - in you know what's the uh the escrow
41:27 - kind of situation where we put the money
41:29 - in there
41:30 - he's able to collect the money or
41:31 - whatever and then it's it's a nice easy
41:33 - way so i recommend if you're gonna buy a
41:34 - domain from somebody i don't have all
41:36 - the details but that's how we did it i
41:38 - would use
41:40 - i would do it that way if you don't know
41:42 - the person do it with some sort of like
41:44 - exchange scenario somebody in the middle
41:46 - that can facilitate it and
41:48 - i don't know if they would actually like
41:50 - press charges that they didn't follow
41:51 - through but there's something there's
41:52 - some sort of commitment well if with an
41:54 - escrow in the middle they can hold the
41:55 - funds yeah yeah i mean it's especially
41:56 - if it's like an international
41:58 - transaction which court you go to yeah
42:00 - dispute things you know yeah exactly
42:02 - smart but change law.com was pretty cool
42:04 - we we even had it was a big move
42:07 - you helped you did all that
42:09 - tell us some of the technical parts of
42:10 - that i mean what was the five years ago
42:12 - just like a lot of lottery a lot of
42:14 - redirect lottery before we dig in all
42:16 - that
42:18 - so of course i listened i had to listen
42:20 - to the first episode of
42:22 - the change log for uh doing the research
42:25 - did you like it i mean it was it was
42:26 - pretty rough i pulled it up on like i've
42:28 - got a i've got a podcast tool that just
42:30 - makes it really easy to pull up uh old
42:32 - podcasts i don't know how they archive
42:33 - it because even when i go on like
42:35 - itunes and try to scroll all the way
42:36 - down it doesn't go all the way back
42:38 - which kind of it's disappointing jerry
42:41 - can share some reasons why at length and
42:43 - in detail but yeah yeah but uh i was
42:46 - able to find it and pull it up and uh
42:48 - we'll link to it in the show notes if
42:49 - you want to give it a listen just to
42:51 - hear that it's really easy
42:52 - to com slash one yeah oh really yeah
42:55 - it's really easy that's a good path um
42:58 - but uh
42:59 - yeah so david berwin i'm sorry neverland
43:02 - yeah
43:03 - sounds like a really cool guy he
43:05 - ultimately went to get a job at github
43:07 - right yeah
43:08 - there's some story there too we can go
43:10 - into a little bit of that so um
43:13 - when i became uh close friends we had
43:16 - actually done some
43:17 - uh some teaching together so when was
43:19 - more developer less designer and less
43:22 - front end but he really had a an eye for
43:25 - aesthetic and an eye for design and he
43:28 - loved to always tinker
43:30 - and he was and if i had to describe he
43:31 - was always like a
43:33 - a minimalist approach to things
43:35 - but not
43:36 - you know he wasn't the kind of developer
43:38 - like i can't touch css or he just loved
43:40 - to like dive into things and he just
43:42 - thrived at that and so we did a um
43:46 - we did a a class at lone star ruby
43:50 - conference in a couple other places i
43:52 - want to say called design eye for the
43:54 - dev guy or gal
43:56 - and it's quite a name which was yeah it
43:58 - was pretty funny and so what we wanted
44:00 - to do is like just help software
44:02 - developers who are just primarily in in
44:05 - code and back-end type stuff and not at
44:07 - all in the front end
44:09 - feel a bit more comfortable with early
44:11 - technologies like sas pre-pre-compilers
44:16 - stuff like that
44:18 - and this is early days of sas this is
44:20 - even before like the scss syntax so like
44:22 - this was
44:23 - super early days so
44:25 - one side small tangent would be that
44:28 - before there was the change log i
44:30 - actually wanted to do a sas podcast but
44:33 - nobody would do it with me
44:35 - so
44:36 - so i i died on that sword and instead
44:38 - decided to do this uh this show
44:42 - uh the change law because uh i had a
44:44 - partner who would be willing to work
44:45 - with me on it so there you go no one was
44:47 - really interested in the sas i was like
44:50 - why don't you just do a css show and
44:51 - there's css tricks and i'm like yeah but
44:53 - chris is nobody i'm just kidding
44:55 - right chris is not nobody he's the man
44:57 - yeah listen chris we love you that's
44:58 - right that was like 2009 though so like
45:00 - where css tricks is today to to where it
45:02 - was then oh yeah chris has done an
45:04 - amazing job so it just we were all early
45:07 - days and that was like before it's where
45:09 - it's at now and so there was just
45:12 - the field was more green there was a lot
45:14 - more opportunity you know in terms of
45:15 - like making carving right whereas now
45:18 - like
45:19 - we wouldn't start a front-end focused
45:21 - website or podcast like that like chris
45:24 - would do you know because
45:26 - somebody started doing it doing it well
45:27 - we would do something else that where
45:29 - there's a hole to fill not
45:31 - not to cramp in on somebody else's style
45:33 - yeah you know open source was clearly
45:35 - something that needed something yeah and
45:36 - it was moving so fast github i mean this
45:38 - the show began in 2009
45:41 - and github had just become a thing in
45:42 - 2008 and a little bit more history going
45:45 - one layer deeper so on the web 2.0 show
45:48 - we actually met up with chris
45:50 - weinstroth and tp dubs tom preston
45:53 - warner uh
45:55 - three months after github was founded
45:56 - wow and we had them on the web 2.0 so if
45:59 - you want to go back and listen to some
46:00 - really interesting old days of github
46:03 - not owned by microsoft not bought for
46:05 - billions
46:06 - like dreamers like these were developers
46:08 - who were like wow we somehow found a way
46:11 - to tie in like this front end and this
46:13 - collaboration and get and like it was
46:15 - before
46:16 - all these visions and dream had come to
46:19 - fruition like they have before they
46:20 - invented the request and so that's to me
46:23 - that's super cool that that's what
46:24 - really got me into like loving this
46:27 - medium was because even with our show we
46:29 - can go back and like chronicle
46:32 - the paths of some developers you know
46:34 - we've had some people on four times
46:36 - three times several times we've seen
46:39 - not only their changes as uh as
46:41 - individual people but the software they
46:44 - command or the things they maintain the
46:45 - communities they lead it's just really
46:47 - interesting i love the fact that we get
46:49 - a chance to be kind of what that drill
46:51 - sergeant was to to me
46:53 - the encourager right we like to shine
46:54 - our light in places where it's not
46:56 - always being shined
46:58 - and just encourage people to press
47:00 - forward to congratulate them for working
47:01 - really hard
47:02 - maintainers who don't get any things we
47:04 - love to pat them on the back and say
47:05 - keep going you're doing an awesome job
47:07 - and just do what we can to put more uh
47:10 - focus on the things they're working on
47:13 - fun fact so
47:16 - github had their own podcast in the very
47:19 - very early days of github called get
47:21 - splosion
47:23 - which was
47:24 - chris wanstroth and tom preston warner
47:26 - and pj hyatt the three founders of
47:28 - github
47:29 - basically just sitting in a room and
47:30 - talking to each other it was very
47:32 - low rent and it was very
47:34 - raw and i think it's disappeared off the
47:37 - internet once they probably raised
47:38 - funding and started probably more
47:40 - corporate probably alive i used to
47:41 - listen to that
47:42 - it was very raw and i loved it i just
47:45 - thought of that when you talked about
47:46 - their early days
47:47 - show they actually had their own show
47:49 - about git and github and they really
47:51 - just hung out anyways yeah if you can
47:53 - find that send us links i'd love to
47:55 - listen to it again it's some interesting
47:56 - content but yeah it's probably gone oh
47:58 - i'm sorry i didn't interrupt one more
48:00 - layer to his story though in speaking to
48:02 - github and podcast we were actually
48:04 - syndicated for a while onto github.com
48:07 - explorer ah so for a while there like
48:09 - they you know this is early days too so
48:11 - they they were just they love what we're
48:13 - doing they love the change law they love
48:15 - what we're trying to do about open
48:16 - source and sharing you know all the
48:18 - things happening and they're like
48:19 - let us help you somehow
48:21 - and so they syndicated the the most
48:23 - recent five episodes were on
48:26 - github.com explorer now it's not there
48:28 - anymore so if you go there don't be
48:29 - disappointed i am but
48:31 - um you know if anybody at github wants
48:33 - to you know reignite i'm just kidding
48:36 - no that's some prime real estate right
48:37 - there yeah it was
48:39 - such an interesting time then too
48:41 - because
48:43 - that github was not at all the github it
48:44 - is today which doesn't mean it's bad or
48:46 - good it just means that it was
48:48 - interesting because
48:49 - we could work with
48:51 - the it was ran by developers and not
48:54 - like oh business people are bad but it
48:55 - was like people who want to help other
48:58 - developers do well and do cool things
49:00 - they were willing to share
49:02 - you know what they were doing and
49:04 - and prop up the show for a while there
49:06 - people actually thought the change was
49:07 - owned by github that's how closely
49:09 - things were and so it's just
49:11 - an interesting time i appreciate the
49:13 - time we were on explorer
49:15 - but it was just really interesting that
49:17 - they were able to share that and it was
49:19 - developers who ran it not some
49:21 - bureaucrats or
49:22 - vc that didn't have this humanity
49:25 - connection to us as software developers
49:27 - just trying to like at that time this
49:29 - show was just a hobby like it was after
49:31 - that it became a business for like a
49:33 - better terms
49:35 - yeah you know
49:36 - yeah and
49:38 - that's what i'm really excited to talk
49:40 - about next so of course there was kind
49:42 - of like a urban dictionary has this
49:45 - definition of this word called pod fade
49:47 - yes
49:48 - essentially a podcast will start
49:50 - publishing less and less frequently and
49:51 - maybe they won't admit to themselves
49:52 - that they're that the best days of the
49:54 - podcast are behind them but
49:56 - maybe they are kind of heading toward
49:58 - the door so to speak so often times with
50:01 - a pod fade there will be a long gap and
50:03 - there'll be one last episode in which
50:05 - the podcast announces that it's
50:07 - returning yes
50:09 - that is when you know you have a podcast
50:13 - apology sorry we've been so quiet we're
50:15 - back and that's that's the end but that
50:17 - happens a lot on youtube too yes we had
50:20 - that but we continued yeah so let's talk
50:22 - about that struggle for the soul of the
50:25 - changed log
50:26 - ah okay so um
50:28 - slight backstory on that too so wen and
50:30 - i both
50:32 - uh met this guy named uh josh cofer who
50:35 - was starting a non-profit he actually
50:37 - met win first and win and i were both
50:40 - freelancing as i mentioned and doing the
50:42 - change law podcast as a hobby fun thing
50:44 - just to do
50:45 - and uh
50:48 - and when was building his team
50:50 - for
50:50 - pure charity this this non-profit that
50:53 - josh koffer was forming
50:55 - to be a place for nonprofits to coalesce
50:58 - to get information on how to best
51:00 - fundraise how to lead their charges how
51:02 - to
51:03 - unify
51:05 - their followers their supporters for
51:06 - lack of better terms um william was like
51:09 - first you know one of the first picks i
51:11 - was a second hire after him so i guess i
51:13 - was first pick
51:14 - um he's like adam do you want you know
51:16 - do you want to do this this kind of
51:17 - thing and so next thing you know we're
51:19 - working for this you know this
51:20 - non-profit called pure charity
51:22 - and uh when was cto i think i was like
51:26 - you know ux design or something like
51:27 - that i don't remember what my title was
51:28 - doesn't matter
51:30 - the point was was that we were just sort
51:32 - of like
51:33 - fleshing out our careers a bit more and
51:35 - about two years pass
51:37 - and the majors call right wins in the
51:40 - farm club at pure charity the majors
51:42 - github calls and says hey when uh you
51:44 - want to come up to san francisco we want
51:46 - to talk to you about some things and so
51:48 - long story short he got called up to the
51:50 - majors he couldn't say no it wasn't it
51:51 - was we both loved we were doing it pure
51:53 - charity but he couldn't say no to it
51:54 - yeah and it was a
51:56 - you know
51:57 - like any podcast it's just a hobby you
51:59 - only have so much love for it and so
52:01 - much time for when you have family you
52:03 - know you've got your career you've got
52:04 - other things and so we was like hey i'm
52:06 - out of time i just can't do this anymore
52:08 - and i think that was around
52:10 - september 2012
52:12 - and uh
52:13 - and
52:14 - and i was kind of bummed i'm like hey i
52:16 - get it i don't have a lot of time for it
52:17 - either
52:18 - and then i sat in this sort of lull for
52:20 - a while just thinking like
52:23 - you know it's not worth much but would
52:24 - anybody want to buy it like should i
52:26 - keep it going what should i do with it
52:28 - you know i know it's i know what it
52:30 - means to so many people and what it
52:31 - could mean if we just keep it going and
52:33 - so i was just really in this whole
52:35 - space where i was just questioning
52:37 - whether it made any more sense for me
52:40 - because i'm definitely you know more on
52:42 - the design front-end side than developer
52:44 - side
52:44 - and jared has to remind me all the time
52:46 - to drop my impostor syndrome and say
52:48 - dude your developer
52:50 - because i
52:51 - at least even right now i feel less
52:53 - developer than i had been before but i
52:55 - was always more on the front end
52:57 - user experience sort of like
52:59 - biz dev side of things relationship side
53:01 - of things how should it look how should
53:03 - it function how can we deliver it then
53:05 - the follow through then the doing part
53:06 - of software
53:08 - and i've i've worked with great people
53:10 - but it's just not where i shine i can do
53:12 - it but i shine better in other areas and
53:14 - so i was like
53:16 - am i an imposter by just keeping this
53:18 - thing going what can i do yeah man that
53:21 - is some hardcore imposter syndrome and i
53:22 - totally yeah there have definitely been
53:24 - deaths with free code camp as well uh
53:26 - where i felt so like a total imposter
53:28 - yeah um but
53:31 - thank goodness you didn't sell it
53:34 - because i
53:35 - there's no way that anybody could have
53:36 - taken it over and brought it to such
53:38 - heights as it is today but thank you um
53:40 - so that's something i'm extremely
53:42 - grateful for that you that you stuck
53:44 - with it um
53:45 - yeah so you stuck with it and and
53:49 - a phone call or
53:50 - tell us the story behind jared entering
53:52 - the stage
53:54 - i'll tee it up uniform and get okay my
53:57 - teep is super short he emailed win yeah
54:00 - and went forward the email to me
54:03 - that was it
54:04 - yeah so i was a listener
54:06 - and i was tracking the blog so win has
54:09 - an uncanny skill of finding new things
54:12 - the gems yeah he could find gems
54:15 - and you know over the years i've tried
54:17 - to imitate that and i've gotten pretty
54:19 - okay at it but i like to find things too
54:21 - you know a new open source project here
54:22 - a new technique a great blog post
54:25 - and so i was following the blog mostly i
54:27 - was i'm also a podcast junkie was back
54:29 - then still that's why i know about git
54:30 - splosion where most people don't even
54:32 - realize that was a podcast i'm like the
54:33 - github guys have a podcast i'll listen
54:35 - to it
54:36 - and so i was a listener of the show and
54:39 - i really appreciated the blog because i
54:40 - was in omaha nebraska doing my thing
54:43 - writing software for people and i very
54:45 - much felt like i was on an island so to
54:48 - speak in the open source world
54:50 - i i cut my teeth on unix and and linux
54:53 - networks and i was a vim guy early on i
54:55 - was just always in open source like i
54:57 - learned perl and then i learned ruby and
54:59 - then rails blew my mind and i was
55:00 - building rails websites and so i was in
55:02 - the open source universe i didn't even
55:04 - really realize that like there was much
55:07 - else even though there's this entire
55:09 - microsoft side of things that i just
55:10 - didn't people started talking about c
55:12 - sharp and i didn't know what they're
55:13 - talking about early on
55:15 - um
55:16 - and then
55:18 - it started to fade and the blogs were
55:20 - coming less and less often and the
55:22 - podcast was happening less and less
55:24 - and i was running my own uh a single
55:28 - person consultancy basically making
55:30 - uh web apps for people
55:32 - and i had known wynn because
55:37 - of ruby i believe i think he had a ruby
55:39 - gem that i used
55:41 - and i can't remember which one it was he
55:43 - actually was involved in the twitter gym
55:44 - for a while yeah he was um and i
55:46 - remember i had you know contributed to
55:48 - that and then basically followed each
55:50 - other on twitter
55:51 - and i started listening to his podcast
55:52 - and he started reading my blog or
55:54 - something anyway we were just mutual
55:56 - connections there
55:57 - and i didn't even know about adam very
56:00 - much except for he was the guy that was
56:02 - always talking to win win did a lot of
56:03 - the interviews on the show back then
56:05 - um i knew that adam was involved in the
56:07 - change log and when the changelog was
56:09 - winning adam but i didn't know who adam
56:11 - was and knew who win was and so when it
56:13 - started to fade out basically i had the
56:17 - capability of just helping out with the
56:19 - blog because i had my own business and
56:21 - so i could fill in gaps and i could do
56:23 - that kind of work and so i just offered
56:25 - i just emailed win i was like hey i see
56:27 - you guys are like struggling to keep it
56:28 - going can i help you know because i can
56:31 - i can blog once a week or whatever it is
56:33 - and so when had i think had actually
56:35 - moved on already i just it was all
56:37 - behind the scenes he was already working
56:38 - in github or something and so he just
56:40 - forwarded he's like hey man thanks for
56:42 - reaching out
56:43 - and he forwarded me to adam and andrew
56:45 - who was also a co-host at the time yeah
56:47 - um because andrew and i were together
56:49 - pure charade as well yeah andrew thorpe
56:50 - and so that's how i got involved was was
56:52 - through that yeah
56:54 - i didn't want to see it die a listener
56:57 - this could be you this is amazing so
56:59 - this this this reminds me of like the
57:01 - story of like you know judas priests how
57:03 - like the robert halford had to leave the
57:04 - band for whatever reason and they found
57:06 - a guy who was running the he
57:09 - he was the singer of a tribute band for
57:11 - judas priest okay and he became the
57:13 - singer of christ
57:15 - it's like a cinderella story and it
57:16 - sounds kind of like this was a
57:17 - cinderella story you're listening one
57:19 - day you're listening to the change log
57:21 - the next day you're on the change slot
57:23 - yeah it was very surreal the first time
57:25 - that i was on the show because i i wrote
57:27 - for the website for a while before i was
57:30 - on the show because andrew was at pure
57:32 - charity andrew moved on to stripe i
57:34 - think he went to yeah he went to work at
57:35 - stripe wasn't going to co-host anymore
57:38 - and
57:39 - uh eventually i came into the co-host
57:41 - role but i remember the first time i was
57:42 - on it was like a reunion episode with me
57:44 - you steve nick and kenneth reitz yeah
57:47 - kenneth reed and andrew was on the show
57:48 - as well yeah five of us and we were just
57:50 - kind of shooting the poop it's supposed
57:52 - to be live every week and it was the
57:53 - first and only live show yeah i could be
57:56 - wrong but
57:57 - but we had ambitions but it was very
57:59 - strange hearing my voice on the show
58:00 - that i've been listening to for all the
58:01 - times you know that was back in uh 2012
58:04 - 2013 time range was when i
58:06 - got involved so
58:07 - yeah well give us a little bit more
58:08 - background about yourself because
58:10 - to even get in the position where you
58:12 - were
58:13 - contributing to these these libraries uh
58:15 - like the twitter gym for example someone
58:18 - i used uh early on as a developer as
58:20 - well so i didn't even realize it until
58:22 - you said it but i've used some of your
58:23 - code
58:24 - um
58:26 - yeah how did you how did you ramp up
58:27 - what's your what's your origin story
58:30 - so it's somewhat humorous to me that
58:31 - you're asking both of us about our
58:33 - origin stories we used to do origin
58:35 - stories on the show that's true in fact
58:37 - you were on the show about four years
58:38 - ago we have got your your origin story
58:41 - as well
58:42 - and we stopped doing those over time
58:44 - because we found that they were kind of
58:45 - hit or miss
58:46 - uh the first one that i remember was
58:49 - kong or mash ape i think ahmad nasrid
58:51 - yeah he had an amazing origin story
58:55 - uh i missed that one i was so bummed
58:56 - yeah i interviewed him by myself and i
58:58 - was like adam this guy had a mate we
58:59 - have to ask everybody their origin
59:01 - stories it's so cool
59:02 - and then we started asking more and more
59:04 - people and it became to where like
59:06 - somebody would have an amazing one the
59:07 - other one would be very boring and
59:09 - straightforward and so that's what
59:10 - you're running into right now because
59:12 - adam just had his origin story from
59:14 - poverty and the military and all these
59:16 - things and my origin story is very
59:18 - status quo for
59:21 - somebody in america and growing up in
59:22 - the 90s i was
59:24 - raised by two parents who
59:27 - loved each other and loved me this
59:28 - coming up on their 50th
59:30 - anniversary in the suburbs of middle
59:33 - america
59:34 - uh
59:35 - pretty typical public school education
59:38 - you know went to college learned some
59:40 - stuff got into got into technology and
59:42 - here i am i mean there's not much
59:44 - there's not much to dig into that's
59:46 - unique or different
59:48 - um
59:48 - and so i don't i don't think we need to
59:50 - cover too much
59:52 - well the one piece of your history that
59:53 - i do like that's kind of interesting is
59:55 - um
59:56 - is
59:57 - the government job you have planned for
59:59 - you after school that's that's an
60:00 - interesting caveat that
60:02 - i don't know how much you want to share
60:03 - about sure that's an interesting caveat
60:04 - to your story yeah absolutely so there
60:06 - are there are some things in there that
60:08 - that we might be able to to dig into so
60:10 - i've always considered myself to be a
60:12 - cautiou a cautious opportunist
60:15 - and so when i see
60:17 - opportunities in my life i just kind of
60:19 - cautiously
60:21 - go into them versus either like
60:23 - rambunctiously going in or jump right in
60:25 - or go or not go in
60:27 - so like that's kind of where i've been
60:29 - and even with the changelog this was not
60:30 - like i decided hey this is going to be a
60:33 - new part of my career i was just more
60:34 - like i could contribute to the blog like
60:37 - i saw a need and i kind of started then
60:39 - it just like slowly slowly steamrolled
60:42 - and so that's the story of my education
60:44 - as well
60:45 - i didn't i wasn't into software i wasn't
60:47 - into technology
60:49 - i got my first computer i was 18 years
60:50 - old which is relatively late for a lot
60:52 - of developers
60:53 - the only thing i did on it was napster
60:55 - you know pretty much and then i play
60:57 - video games
60:58 - um
60:59 - a friend of mine in high school
61:02 - told me i should apply for a scholarship
61:04 - there's a thing in omaha called the
61:06 - walter j scott scholarship walter scott
61:08 - is a guy who's done very well for
61:11 - himself and uh has a scholarship for
61:14 - certain students to go into
61:16 - technology
61:17 - industry and then stay in omaha is kind
61:19 - of his deal that's cool
61:21 - i had never heard of it my friend said
61:22 - hey you should try this out it's an i.t
61:24 - thing and i was like i.t what's that it
61:26 - was
61:27 - you know
61:28 - internet things right i mean i was
61:30 - actually planning on being an architect
61:31 - that was
61:32 - but i wasn't like passionate about art
61:34 - you know in school they kind of like
61:35 - make you pick something
61:37 - and uh i had done pretty good on the cad
61:40 - machine like i could dr draw a thread
61:42 - you know i remember my my cad design
61:45 - teacher was like you're gonna make a
61:46 - great architect one day i'm like okay
61:48 - i'll be an architect
61:49 - and that was like the extent of my
61:51 - passion for architecture but i was like
61:53 - okay i could do that looking back i
61:55 - think i was just good at manipulating
61:56 - the computer to make a thread design not
61:58 - the actual design itself so i was
62:00 - probably just better at cad than i was
62:01 - at architecture
62:03 - because i i do have a knack for these
62:05 - things but i just didn't know it anyways
62:07 - my friend
62:08 - chad told me about this scholarship
62:11 - and my pre my other friend aaron had
62:12 - gotten the scholarship a year earlier
62:14 - it's for people who test pretty well on
62:16 - on scores
62:19 - and aaron tested very well and i thought
62:21 - if he could do it i could do it that was
62:22 - kind of my my attitude so i applied for
62:26 - the scholarship got the scholarship and
62:28 - it included you know like a computer and
62:30 - stuff like that full ride to you
62:32 - university of nebraska so that was
62:34 - really cool and that's really what got
62:36 - me into software at all i was management
62:38 - information systems
62:39 - i was it's which is kind of like
62:41 - computer science but it's not computer
62:43 - science it's like
62:45 - they try to sell as the best of both
62:46 - worlds of like business and computer
62:48 - science together i found out that's
62:51 - actually means like the least of both of
62:52 - those worlds right like you're not a
62:54 - computer scientist you're not a business
62:56 - person either and so it's kind of like
62:57 - just a lukewarm version of either of
62:59 - those other majors right
63:01 - don't recommend it just go computer
63:03 - science if you are going to go to a
63:04 - four-year
63:05 - school second that recommendation
63:07 - um or just start off recode campaign uh
63:11 - and i didn't really learn yeah in the
63:13 - second day i would encourage people to
63:15 - still go to school if you have the
63:16 - resources to go to school yeah i would
63:18 - too
63:19 - um
63:20 - well there's lots of routes so i
63:21 - actually i'll say this
63:23 - everybody needs something a little bit
63:25 - different
63:26 - and so for some people a free code camp
63:28 - is like 100 the way to go even if they
63:30 - have the resources for some people
63:32 - a uh a boot camp like an in-person
63:35 - immersive but still short thing is great
63:37 - way to get started they can go from
63:38 - there for other people they may need you
63:40 - know a four-year degree before they go
63:42 - into it your age matters your life
63:44 - circumstance matters absolutely and so
63:45 - there really is not like a
63:47 - a single solution to rule them all which
63:49 - is why i love how many options there are
63:51 - and how it's like an ecosystem anyways a
63:52 - little bit off topic i like that though
63:54 - i mean
63:55 - a lot of facets to how you can learn
63:56 - that's what's important right the
63:58 - important thing to communicate is
63:59 - there's not one way that that rules all
64:02 - your way may be different than mine or
64:04 - jared's or quincy's
64:05 - and it's just a matter of persevering
64:07 - through it getting over the humps and
64:08 - hurdles right that
64:10 - sometimes i mean that's why it's hard
64:13 - because hard things if it was easy
64:15 - everyone would do it it's hard because
64:17 - it's worth doing so persevere
64:20 - find some friends or your tribe to
64:23 - you know guide you through or support
64:25 - you through you know get get people
64:27 - around you mentors all that stuff so
64:29 - there isn't one way that's the best fit
64:31 - for everybody
64:33 - yeah so i cautiously walked into that
64:34 - opportunity and it worked out and that
64:37 - moved me off the architecture track and
64:38 - into the computer world so to speak i
64:41 - didn't really learn very much about
64:43 - computer systems
64:44 - in the first few years of my college
64:47 - it's just a unfortunate fact some of
64:49 - that was me a lot of that was the school
64:52 - my last year i found another potential
64:55 - scholarship and i liked scholarships
64:57 - because uh it's free money
64:59 - and
65:00 - uh this one was cool so the one a cool
65:02 - thing about the walter scott scholarship
65:03 - is it's uh stackable and there's
65:05 - actually a term i can't remember what it
65:06 - is but certain ones you get like a full
65:08 - ride and you're done you can't actually
65:09 - get other scholarships well for
65:11 - enterprising students who would rather
65:13 - get scholarships than like jobs like
65:15 - myself
65:16 - uh
65:17 - you could find ones that stacked and if
65:19 - you can get those then you're basically
65:20 - getting more money so i found another
65:21 - scholarship
65:23 - called the
65:24 - national science foundation scholarship
65:26 - for service
65:27 - and it was all about information
65:28 - assurance and so this was like a push
65:30 - into
65:32 - getting
65:33 - some of these cs people and mis people
65:36 - into software security so assurance that
65:39 - your software is information assurance
65:41 - yeah but it's like quality assurance and
65:43 - information security yeah
65:45 - matched up exactly it's like how sure
65:47 - are you and can you can we be sure about
65:49 - our systems and so it was very much a
65:51 - a a government thing
65:54 - um
65:55 - it was two years
65:56 - of schooling which stacked on top of my
65:59 - other scholarship
66:00 - with a concentration on information
66:02 - assurance which was a new thing at the
66:03 - university at the time i think it still
66:04 - exists but it's basically i learned
66:06 - penetration testing
66:08 - securing and hardening systems you know
66:10 - defense in depth all these security
66:12 - concepts
66:14 - um
66:15 - and then i was supposed to go into
66:17 - two
66:19 - attached to that is two years to work
66:21 - with
66:22 - a government agency
66:25 - upon graduation
66:27 - so
66:28 - it was really great i actually learned a
66:29 - lot in that program you learn the the
66:32 - really nitty-gritty of how systems work
66:34 - networks especially and how insecure
66:36 - they are and ways that you can pick
66:38 - those things apart
66:39 - um
66:40 - upon graduation there was a hiring
66:42 - freeze in the
66:44 - in the government and so we had a
66:46 - circumstance where you know sometimes
66:48 - the right hand doesn't know what the
66:49 - left hand is doing well on the right
66:50 - side
66:51 - of the government's hands they were
66:53 - creating a new scholarship for service
66:55 - to get all these new bright young minds
66:57 - to go work for a three-letter agency and
67:01 - on the left-hand side they had a hiring
67:03 - freeze on so we were the first class
67:06 - that did the scholarship there's 200 of
67:08 - us nationwide
67:09 - and there were no jobs
67:11 - for us but we had this
67:14 - agreement commitment yeah a commitment a
67:16 - two-year commitment
67:18 - and so it was kind of like make you peel
67:20 - potatoes for two years well they wanted
67:22 - us to wait
67:24 - sit around and wait really they expected
67:26 - you to wait for just two years before
67:27 - starting your career yeah sit around and
67:29 - wait
67:30 - so
67:31 - that was unfortunate so i was in this
67:32 - weird like uh
67:34 - no man's land where i was graduating
67:37 - i had this commitment but there was no
67:40 - job to actually fulfill a commitment and
67:42 - so what was i supposed to do well
67:44 - uh in that time frame this is like when
67:46 - i was in the 21 to 23
67:49 - time reign time range uh at age 22 i
67:52 - became a christian and i started to
67:53 - attend a local bible
67:56 - church
67:57 - in omaha and i really felt like it was
67:59 - important for me to stay there
68:01 - while i was there i met
68:03 - the pastor who's also an i.t guy
68:06 - and ran a software company with
68:09 - a networking need
68:11 - and he was like i'll put you to work
68:14 - and even it's great really he's like
68:15 - yeah in fact you can work for me as long
68:17 - as you want and then if they come
68:19 - knocking
68:20 - then you can just leave like you know
68:22 - most
68:22 - people it's hard to find a job in that
68:24 - place because like by the way i might
68:26 - have to quit at any moment's notice and
68:27 - go work for the government he was like
68:30 - he did that for me oh stand-up guy yeah
68:32 - he's spectacular changed my life in many
68:34 - ways that guy his name is john malone
68:37 - and
68:39 - he also thought it was ridiculous that
68:41 - they were
68:43 - basically holding this commitment to us
68:45 - and so he helped me petition the school
68:47 - and the system and basically they let a
68:49 - lot of us just off our commitment
68:50 - because there's no jobs and so he was
68:52 - instrumental in you know providing for
68:54 - me during that time period and then also
68:57 - helping me to get that commitment raised
68:59 - and so
69:00 - i just kept working for him i was like
69:02 - well
69:03 - this worked out pretty well uh he helped
69:05 - me out when i was in a bind he's a
69:07 - software guy he from way back in the day
69:09 - he knows all the the nuts and bolts of
69:12 - like the old school software guys
69:14 - and he's got work for me to do so i just
69:16 - worked for him for a while
69:18 - um i was never really considered myself
69:20 - a programmer back then i was kind of
69:23 - like a
69:24 - networking scripter i consider myself a
69:26 - scripter it's funny how reluctant people
69:29 - are to consider themselves developers or
69:31 - developers
69:32 - like i'm not quite a developer i know
69:34 - like i took some of the developer like i
69:36 - took c plus plus and i took
69:38 - uh c programming which i actually liked
69:40 - more than c plus plus we can we could
69:41 - talk about that but
69:43 - and
69:45 - i learned pearl
69:46 - and as a penetration tester as a person
69:48 - who's like trying to break into systems
69:50 - and stuff
69:51 - or find holes or even as a script kitty
69:54 - like there's a reason why they're called
69:55 - script kitties because they don't have
69:56 - the skills of a cat but they got the
69:59 - scripts and so i would learn scripts i
70:01 - would read scripts i would write scripts
70:03 - i consider myself like an automator and
70:05 - so i i wrote a lot of perl scripts
70:07 - um and then i found the ruby programming
70:09 - language and i was like why would i
70:10 - write perl scripts when i can write ruby
70:12 - scripts kind of the spiritual successor
70:14 - to ruby yeah
70:16 - yeah i borrowed a lot of the great
70:18 - things from pearl and then discarded
70:19 - some of the things some of the warts
70:21 - um
70:22 - [Music]
70:23 - and so
70:25 - i started writing ruby i knew some pearl
70:26 - i knew some ruby i considered myself a
70:28 - networking guy like i ran some mail
70:29 - servers and i would automate a lot of
70:32 - things around that job so while i was
70:33 - working for john i automated a lot of
70:35 - the things that he had for me to do on
70:37 - the network and so i could either
70:39 - twiddle my thumbs at work because i had
70:42 - automated all my my responsibilities or
70:45 - i could consid continue learning my skit
70:47 - you know establishing my skills and so
70:50 - i was tweaking wordpress blogs mostly my
70:53 - blog it's kind of like pimp my blog
70:54 - early in the day yeah where i had this
70:56 - blog it was probably slightly
70:58 - better than adams in terms of like
70:59 - content because it was like a i was
71:01 - trying to write interesting things it
71:03 - wasn't what you said it's like family
71:04 - photos and stuff pretty much yeah a
71:05 - little bit more an occasional personal
71:07 - thought but nothing very profound and i
71:09 - was writing about software and just
71:11 - blogging
71:12 - and i really want is a wordpress site i
71:14 - really wanted my
71:16 - latest i remember when i started
71:17 - realizing oh i can just program websites
71:20 - there's like a flip in my mind and it
71:22 - was uh i wanted my most recently played
71:25 - itunes songs in the sidebar of my blog
71:28 - because back this is the blogosphere day
71:30 - yeah you were trying to share kind of
71:31 - the little things i wanted to pit my
71:33 - blog like i wanted cool stuff in my
71:35 - sidebar
71:36 - and so i had to basically start writing
71:39 - php like i wrote a wordpress plugin or
71:41 - something like that
71:42 - and it talked to the you know the the
71:45 - imac at my house i came here exactly the
71:46 - details
71:48 - and i got it done you know and that was
71:51 - really cool and then i was like okay
71:52 - what else can i do with my blog you know
71:54 - start like integrating the flickr stuff
71:55 - into this right all these masters not
71:58 - instagram flickr that's right back in
71:59 - the flickr days
72:01 - all the math and we were just mashing
72:02 - stuff up back then that was the cool
72:03 - thing open apis mash them up come up
72:05 - with something new i loved that stuff
72:08 - yeah and so that's when i started
72:10 - thinking you know what i could just do
72:11 - this for other people
72:13 - because uh it's pretty cool
72:16 - and i saw the power of the web platform
72:18 - really and i was like every business
72:20 - needs something like this or could or
72:22 - could be advantaged by having one like
72:24 - today it's kind of table stakes to have
72:26 - a certain you know web
72:28 - presence but back then we're talking
72:29 - 2006 it was not table stakes it was
72:32 - advanced it was a competitive advantage
72:34 - you know
72:35 - so i started helping people do that kind
72:37 - of stuff i learned ruby on rails and
72:39 - because i had this job where i was doing
72:41 - networking but also this boss who was
72:43 - like hey you've you've achieved all
72:46 - these goals that we need if you can go
72:48 - make money another way go ahead and go
72:49 - do that and so i started bringing
72:52 - basically freelance consulting clients
72:54 - into his business
72:56 - and operating on like a one-on-one basis
72:58 - with them and i did that for years and
73:00 - that's kind of
73:01 - from that mill eventually i i went out
73:03 - on my own and started my own
73:05 - entity
73:06 - uh doing very similar work bought my
73:08 - customers from him uh you know
73:12 - still great friends to this day it
73:13 - wasn't like that uh
73:15 - started doing it on my own and in that
73:17 - circumstances when i was like
73:19 - fly away a bird fly away yeah exactly
73:22 - you graduated yeah so yeah under those
73:25 - circumstances i could help out with the
73:27 - change log
73:28 - and so that's in 2012 is when i
73:31 - hooked up with adam and went you know
73:33 - you're hearing this somewhat for the
73:34 - first time right i mean and kind of i am
73:36 - too it's i'm kind of mind blown that
73:39 - what's interesting about
73:40 - the story of success right this
73:43 - overnight success actually took many
73:44 - years and then you when you dig into the
73:46 - details you get to see all the little
73:48 - things
73:49 - that sort of
73:51 - had to happen to make things yeah
73:54 - successful or happen right like if
73:57 - jared wasn't fortunate enough in those
73:58 - ways to have a good friend given that
74:02 - opportunity him thrive in it and then
74:04 - excel at it to a point where he can
74:06 - actually go off on his own and have that
74:09 - freedom and flexibility well geez i mean
74:13 - he would have never emailed wynn i would
74:14 - have probably pod faded forever right
74:16 - you know and it would have been just a
74:19 - dead dog yeah you're right i mean what
74:21 - i'm getting from hearing your respective
74:23 - origin stories is there are so many
74:26 - people along the way yeah who
74:28 - were almost guarded
74:30 - in a way yeah and
74:32 - cleared the path for you to go toward
74:35 - your destiny of uh running the change
74:37 - log together yeah one more aspect that
74:38 - jared's story that he's not sharing yet
74:40 - i'm sure he might is the same person
74:42 - john told him what enough communicator
74:44 - he was that's right and he's the person
74:46 - that sort of like gave that insight to
74:47 - jared so sometimes you have these these
74:49 - truths about you
74:50 - that you don't know right it's kind of
74:52 - weird to like know you but not know all
74:55 - of you and somebody else sees this thing
74:56 - in you
74:57 - and he shares this with jared that he's
74:59 - a really good communicator tell the
75:00 - story of course but you know and it sort
75:02 - of like gave jared a new perspective on
75:04 - right how he could be as good as he is
75:06 - in software and technology but then also
75:08 - a good communicator and to bridge those
75:10 - two yeah so that was one of the insights
75:12 - that john gave me uh at some point
75:14 - camera exactly when i've been working
75:16 - for him for a while i'd known him for a
75:18 - while
75:18 - and we were good friends
75:20 - and he saw my
75:23 - programming skills which are you know i
75:26 - would say average to slightly above
75:28 - average like i can i can throw down but
75:30 - i'm not gonna blow anybody away okay
75:33 - there's hundreds if not thousands of
75:34 - better developers out there
75:36 - maybe tens of thousands i don't know we
75:38 - don't yeah we don't measure these things
75:39 - point is is like could i be the best
75:42 - software developer in the world no but i
75:45 - can hold my own and then on the other
75:47 - side with communication skills and the
75:50 - ability to to write well to think
75:53 - you know off the top of your head to
75:54 - speak to people in ways that they
75:55 - understand
75:56 - uh am i the best at that no i'm not the
75:59 - best at that either but there's very few
76:01 - people that kind of play in both of
76:03 - those playgrounds i mean the stereo type
76:06 - of a developer which i believe we're
76:08 - finally starting to break out of that
76:09 - mold and i love it there's so many
76:11 - different kinds of developers now but
76:12 - it's like the
76:13 - the anti-social you know person in their
76:16 - basement
76:17 - very doesn't want to talk to people
76:18 - wants to just i just want to code all
76:20 - day and drink mountain dew like that
76:21 - stereotype uh there's some truth in
76:24 - stereotypes right uh
76:26 - generally there's truth and then
76:28 - specifically they're they're wrong
76:29 - they're false but the general truth
76:31 - there is that developers are not the
76:33 - best communicators and so there's very
76:35 - few good developers who can also
76:37 - communicate and so john said to me i
76:39 - didn't realize any of this i'm looking
76:40 - back at it realizing he said
76:42 - where you're going to succeed in this
76:45 - industry is that you can be
76:47 - you can bridge the gap between
76:49 - developers and
76:51 - communication skills
76:53 - and i was like oh cool maybe you're
76:55 - right oh cool
76:57 - and then it's like well a podcast about
76:58 - software development yeah i guess that
77:00 - does
77:00 - kind of make sense in retrospect so yeah
77:02 - he definitely
77:03 - made me aware of that as a possibility
77:06 - you know i didn't even think about it
77:08 - so yeah we've had you know i think
77:09 - everybody has
77:11 - influencers or enablers or
77:14 - you know that drill sergeant that says
77:15 - you're a leader now yeah uh i think
77:17 - everybody has those stories and
77:19 - sometimes it takes introspection and
77:21 - reflection to actually think about that
77:23 - you know because
77:24 - so much we're just like iterating
77:26 - forward yeah and not looking back
77:28 - so lots of people yeah
77:31 - thank god for him too i mean geez
77:34 - you know that's why i think it's so
77:36 - important if you're in that position
77:37 - that's why i made that point earlier and
77:39 - to make it again is that if you're in
77:40 - that kind of position
77:42 - to um to enable somebody what a blessing
77:46 - it is to enable somebody
77:48 - the feedback loop is nice it's a nice to
77:50 - have it's not a need to have in if
77:52 - you're in that position because
77:53 - just help people along the way i mean i
77:55 - can't even imagine how many people have
77:56 - listened to your show or our show or
77:59 - have been influenced by free code camp
78:00 - or the changelog or whatever we're doing
78:02 - that we've never even heard of that like
78:05 - their lives have literally changed and
78:07 - we don't even know yeah you know we just
78:09 - gotta show up every day
78:11 - do what we do
78:12 - you know if we say we're gonna do it do
78:14 - it if they say we're gonna be there be
78:15 - there
78:16 - and just
78:18 - help people to find respect you know
78:21 - compassion
78:22 - empathy and
78:24 - and
78:25 - sometimes even the benefit of the doubt
78:27 - you know yeah not everybody's bad and
78:29 - everybody's good but uh finding that
78:31 - balance and uh encouraging somebody and
78:33 - being that person that's
78:35 - that's what i that's what i love most
78:36 - about
78:38 - what we do is is being able to
78:40 - to influence people's lives yeah and to
78:43 - love on people
78:44 - and i know we're not we're not to that
78:46 - part of the interview yet but i'll just
78:47 - say the the impact that you've had with
78:49 - free code camp in the first five years
78:51 - we'll get to that later yeah i mean it's
78:54 - it's amazing to watch what you've done
78:55 - there and and the amount of people whose
78:57 - lives you've helped i mean it's
78:58 - it's astounding i mean i've read those
79:00 - numbers that you put in that blog post
79:02 - and i was just like wow that's this is
79:04 - some serious impact and like
79:06 - you know that tide is rising a lot of
79:09 - people's ships and it's it's really cool
79:11 - so
79:12 - thank you props to you on that thanks
79:13 - i'm uh doing my best just like you all
79:16 - right trying to be consistent yeah the
79:18 - three c's right yeah well why don't you
79:20 - just go since we mentioned the 3c yeah
79:22 - this is something that i
79:24 - i had
79:25 - kind of just kind of recognized whenever
79:28 - i thought about the recipe for success
79:30 - when it comes to producing a podcast or
79:33 - basically any sort of piece of content
79:35 - you have
79:36 - uh basically three c's you got quality
79:39 - content
79:40 - or just content
79:41 - produced on a consistent basis
79:44 - to a community of people so if you're
79:46 - producing content that's good that
79:47 - people want to consume enjoy share
79:51 - like whatever it might be
79:53 - on a consistent basis or at least
79:55 - something where you set an expectation
79:57 - you know hey i'm going to do a show
79:58 - every week and then that's your that's
80:00 - your rhythm that's your cadence and then
80:02 - if you wrap all that around to
80:04 - a community or either develop a
80:06 - community or do it for a community
80:09 - then you're going to have some success
80:10 - because that's all it takes
80:12 - you could be talking about
80:15 - knitting you could be talking about
80:16 - software you could be talking about uh
80:18 - cameras and lighting you could be
80:20 - talking about microphones whatever if
80:22 - you do that on that kind of rhythm that
80:25 - kind of basis with that kind of focus
80:27 - you'll find success
80:30 - and that's
80:31 - and that's not easy to do either no it's
80:32 - not the three c's is it's nice to
80:34 - remember them and it's it it is somewhat
80:37 - easy to say even though you throw the
80:38 - cue in there that makes you up but it's
80:40 - easy to say but especially the
80:42 - consistency part like you said quincy
80:44 - you're just trying to be consistent yeah
80:45 - and like even now we've transitioned
80:47 - into like a full-blown business and like
80:50 - we're established we've been here for 10
80:52 - years but like consistency
80:54 - you know
80:55 - quality content is hard as well i feel
80:57 - like we've gotten better at that over
80:58 - the years and you can you can develop an
81:00 - eye for it and sometimes you still
81:02 - strike out or in our case an ear yeah or
81:04 - an ear for it um
81:06 - community is something that comes
81:07 - naturally to people who commune with
81:09 - other people yeah yeah you have to put
81:11 - effort into that and it doesn't come
81:13 - without effort
81:14 - but
81:15 - it's not as hard as consistency
81:18 - consistency consistency is so hard and
81:20 - that's why the pod fade is like a word
81:21 - in urban dictionary i would say
81:23 - for me i think that
81:26 - the harder thing is community
81:29 - because it's not like field of dreams
81:30 - build it when they come it's you've got
81:31 - to be there you got to show up every day
81:34 - you got to be invitational you're saying
81:35 - the consistency
81:37 - i think it plays the community that's
81:38 - right that's right man they're all three
81:40 - hard yeah so i find it
81:43 - i i find it personally for me
81:46 - it's been a little easier to be
81:47 - consistent with quality content and
81:50 - harder to be part of the community and
81:53 - develop that yeah that's just you know
81:55 - that's me just like with learning you
81:57 - have different paths for me that's the
81:59 - area where i
82:00 - fail more often i think or or don't
82:03 - thrive as well yeah well let's talk
82:06 - about how
82:08 - jared came on board and
82:10 - you had circumstances that were
82:12 - propelling you to professionalize the
82:14 - change yeah if you will
82:16 - well i think when win left it it
82:18 - certainly put a kink in my
82:20 - thought pattern for it like i had made
82:22 - some money um
82:25 - just enough to sort of like you know
82:26 - server cost pay the bills make it
82:28 - somewhat worth it it wasn't like we
82:30 - could leave
82:31 - uh our full-time jobs and even remotely
82:34 - consider doing that as a full-time thing
82:36 - you know we had some early sponsors we'd
82:38 - work with github early for different
82:39 - things when they were promoting github
82:41 - jobs
82:42 - um
82:43 - you know and even then we didn't have a
82:45 - keen eye on how to best partner with
82:47 - brands
82:48 - to help them share their messages in
82:50 - ways that developers really want to hear
82:53 - so relevance is one but then also
82:55 - not objectifying like oh you should get
82:58 - you know just i don't know just finding
82:59 - a way to humanize these businesses and
83:01 - help them reach developers in ways they
83:02 - just weren't able to in other ways like
83:04 - it's not a display ad it's not this or
83:06 - whatever
83:07 - and i think when it became a business
83:10 - the
83:11 - the one thing for me personally which is
83:13 - sort of embarrassing to even mention as
83:14 - i mentioned i was a freelancer for a
83:16 - while and didn't really have a in quotes
83:19 - job i was my own self-employer so to
83:21 - speak
83:22 - um
83:23 - you know i didn't do the best i could
83:25 - have done with filing my taxes properly
83:27 - and paying my taxes properly and you
83:29 - know thank god the government has an
83:31 - option where you can establish a payment
83:33 - plan and i did
83:34 - but that didn't mean that the tax debt
83:36 - was gone right away so i had accumulated
83:38 - a little bit of tax debt
83:40 - having
83:41 - essentially bloodied my knuckles as a
83:42 - freelancer i didn't do things so well
83:44 - learned learned how to do it better and
83:46 - then corrected those things but
83:48 - yeah and and this happens to a lot of
83:50 - freelancers
83:51 - the the us tax code is
83:54 - complicated yeah it is but lately uh you
83:57 - know well even as a nonprofit that
83:59 - doesn't have to pay taxes we still spend
84:01 - a huge amount of time yeah figuring out
84:03 - like how to report everything yeah big
84:05 - big event over here
84:06 - keep that designation right that's
84:08 - that's even it too like the difficulty
84:10 - of
84:11 - reporting it especially as
84:14 - uh someone who's only collecting 1099s
84:17 - uh that's really difficult it really is
84:20 - and like you're so focused on just like
84:22 - at least for me my experience was so
84:24 - focused on just
84:26 - showing up and doing that i felt like
84:28 - gosh i just
84:29 - could taxes be a little easier to do
84:31 - and so
84:32 - i just didn't do them
84:35 - for for like a couple years that's no
84:36 - big deal but the point was this
84:39 - what started to to move it into this
84:41 - full-time business you know even an
84:43 - option for it was you know one obviously
84:47 - we heard the baxter jared and all these
84:49 - things sort of orchestrating and coming
84:50 - to be but then two i had just been
84:52 - recently married my wife and i we met in
84:54 - 2010
84:56 - we got married in 2012 and this is
84:58 - around that time i mentioned when
84:59 - stepped away late 2012 and i would say
85:02 - 2012
85:03 - to 2013 was the years we began to to
85:06 - formulate what has become a business
85:08 - you know it been in place since 2009
85:11 - didn't really become anything
85:13 - business substance until 2012 2013
85:16 - and that's my wife saying hey you can't
85:18 - do my wife just help me as a man guard
85:21 - my time because
85:23 - as somebody who's just ambitious you
85:26 - will often just throw yourselves into
85:28 - things that you probably shouldn't say
85:30 - yes to you probably should say no more
85:32 - often and you know to help me understand
85:34 - that and guard me from that she said
85:37 - if you're gonna do this if you're gonna
85:38 - take time away from our relationship our
85:41 - future etc
85:43 - you got to find some way to make it make
85:46 - money you know make it worth it and so
85:49 - what was really interesting about that
85:50 - is having the heart to love on and care
85:52 - for a community and show up and do these
85:54 - things basically for free no one
85:56 - downloads a podcast and pays a buck
85:57 - right it's all for free but somewhere
86:00 - along the lines we've got to find a way
86:02 - to make a business model or develop a
86:03 - business model that can
86:05 - help us do what we plan to do which is
86:07 - create this awesome content and thrive
86:09 - in the community do it consistently like
86:10 - the 3c say
86:12 - but
86:13 - have a model that allows us to to
86:15 - operate that way and so that was the
86:17 - hardest part was figuring out what that
86:18 - model was
86:20 - it gets kind of easy because sponsorship
86:22 - for podcast seems to be the most
86:25 - typical
86:26 - uh especially now that it's kind of
86:27 - become a thing
86:29 - you know earlier 29 uh 2009 2012 even in
86:33 - that era there wasn't a lot of podcasts
86:35 - it was still early it was before serial
86:38 - and the big boom of podcasts and
86:39 - whatever so
86:40 - you know
86:42 - obviously it would make sense to build a
86:43 - business model around
86:45 - around sponsors now
86:47 - early version was like
86:49 - no sponsors
86:51 - members only kind of thing and in all
86:54 - honesty i would love to run a membership
86:56 - driven only kind of business that maybe
86:59 - not love it would be nice it would be
87:01 - fortunate to do that but it's just not
87:03 - it's just not enough to to do what we
87:05 - try to do and and
87:07 - so especially back we've tried some
87:09 - different models we've tried it yeah
87:10 - this is true this was pre-patreon yeah
87:13 - this was pre
87:14 - uh
87:16 - really the modern era of the web where i
87:18 - think people are more forward to support
87:20 - things that they love because they don't
87:22 - want them to go away um
87:25 - back then it was
87:26 - more random like it just wasn't
87:28 - something that people are used to doing
87:29 - yeah and so maybe now it would be more
87:31 - feasible whereas when we tried it right
87:33 - which was around the time that i joined
87:35 - 20 2012 i remember the announcement was
87:37 - i wasn't there yet it was like member
87:39 - supported only right and i was like
87:41 - really and i was even a die-hard
87:43 - listener i don't think i signed up
87:45 - so like it's really hard that's terrible
87:46 - yeah sorry man i signed up
87:48 - for five bucks
87:50 - it was hard to get people it was a hard
87:51 - sell back then maybe it's easier now but
87:53 - uh
87:56 - so so a membership program didn't work
87:58 - out the way you hoped it would but you
88:00 - were quick to adapt right
88:02 - well we had to i mean if we were gonna
88:04 - so if i was following my wife's advice
88:06 - hey if you're taking my time away from
88:08 - our time with you know as a relationship
88:11 - and growing our marriage
88:13 - then i've got to find a way to make this
88:15 - succeed as a business
88:17 - and i thought memberships would work i
88:18 - was really
88:20 - hopeful that it would i still as jared
88:23 - said i think we've we've now come into a
88:25 - new world where they're more possible
88:27 - and you also have this sort of new
88:29 - change where people want to support the
88:31 - things they love
88:33 - and i think we have a small amount of
88:35 - people globally that would want to give
88:38 - that to us and i don't want to take the
88:39 - opportunity away the problem i think was
88:41 - that we were relying on that completely
88:43 - as a business model
88:45 - and that just didn't it just didn't work
88:47 - as a
88:48 - solo business model they just it needed
88:50 - more
88:51 - more than that
88:52 - and i think for us i mean
88:54 - there's a lot of opportunity on the
88:56 - table there's so many businesses out
88:57 - there that are trying to reach software
89:00 - developers you know stable partners of
89:02 - ours like leno digitalocean fastly
89:05 - rollbar
89:06 - um
89:08 - git prime and help me if i'm forgetting
89:10 - some because i mean it's not like a long
89:12 - exhaustive list i'm trying to like thank
89:13 - everybody but like some really
89:15 - strong businesses that want to help
89:18 - brands like ours do what we do and at
89:21 - the same time reach an audience they
89:22 - couldn't otherwise reach there's that's
89:24 - something that's something we can latch
89:26 - on to
89:27 - uh fast that i mentioned in particular
89:29 - hey if you listen to our show you might
89:31 - have heard this phrase before bandwidth
89:33 - for change levels provided by fastly
89:35 - learn more at fasta.com you know we move
89:37 - fast and fix things here change a lot
89:38 - because of roll bar head to robot a
89:40 - comment check head to robot.com and
89:41 - check them out and uh you know was the
89:44 - last one we're hosting
89:49 - that's right that's right and so you
89:52 - know stole that i have that idea from
89:54 - lee laporte i mean gosh lee laporte is
89:56 - an icon in
89:58 - podcasting podcasting right tech
90:00 - podcasting right if you listen to their
90:02 - show you know net cash you love
90:05 - pass you trust from people you love
90:06 - that's right there you go yeah they just
90:08 - changed using podcasts now i think they
90:10 - yeah he was stuck on a netcast they were
90:12 - really tears he was stuck yeah he had a
90:14 - chip on his shoulder he got over it yeah
90:16 - yeah yeah but then catfly was one of
90:17 - their core partners i'm like well we if
90:20 - so if i want to build a business around
90:21 - this we've got to find some i can
90:23 - remember talking to you about this i'm
90:24 - like do you think we can get somebody to
90:26 - do this and give us money every month
90:29 - and and like
90:31 - other people that advise us that's
90:32 - probably not possible good luck well we
90:34 - did it you know and uh we find ways to
90:38 - support our business
90:40 - in in ways that just i'm astounded
90:43 - honestly
90:44 - and we're really fortunate we've done a
90:46 - great job you know forging not just
90:48 - sponsorships like that's the sort of the
90:50 - industry term that's known
90:52 - you know we're interested in sponsorship
90:54 - whatever but we look at it more like
90:56 - partnerships you know we thrive
90:59 - our business
91:00 - even personally we thrive on
91:02 - relationships and so we want to work
91:04 - with brands that know who we are know
91:07 - what we're trying to do want to support
91:09 - that but then also get paid a dividend
91:11 - by being able to
91:13 - in
91:14 - in authentic ways speak to the global
91:17 - audience we've been able to cultivate
91:18 - over these years right you know and do
91:20 - that in a way that doesn't objectify our
91:22 - audience or only come in for
91:25 - these reasons like there's it's got to
91:27 - be more to it than just that you know
91:28 - and we help them speak to software
91:31 - developers in ways that
91:33 - that that are relevant yeah
91:35 - i think it's worth pointing out that
91:37 - podcast advertising really works
91:41 - in ways that other forms of advertising
91:43 - don't really work yeah and so the medium
91:46 - is
91:46 - is suited very well
91:49 - for that style
91:50 - uh
91:51 - campaign because
91:53 - you are in you're going directly into
91:55 - people's ears you know week by week time
91:58 - by time
91:59 - and
92:00 - if you can be a staple and supporting a
92:02 - show that people love and are getting
92:03 - for free and so they i think as
92:04 - listeners i'm like i said i'm an old
92:06 - podcast junkie i know a lot of the
92:08 - sponsors who are supporting the shows
92:09 - that i love
92:10 - and i am fine with transferring a little
92:12 - bit of goodwill to that company it's
92:14 - like yeah casper supports this show you
92:17 - know we a lot of the mainstream tech
92:19 - podcasts have very the
92:21 - usual suspects of sponsors right casper
92:24 - squarespace audible like these are
92:26 - brands that have
92:28 - years and years of goodwill because
92:30 - they've been supporting the shows that i
92:31 - love and because they have
92:34 - their hosts the people that i love their
92:36 - shows talking about their brands it's
92:39 - just a very effective thing yeah and so
92:41 - people the reason why i think podcasts
92:43 - are
92:44 - uh such a vibrant ecosystem right now is
92:48 - it's very good for consumers because
92:49 - it's on-demand
92:50 - niche like listen to what you want none
92:53 - of the stuff you don't want it's really
92:54 - low overhead for consumers compared to
92:57 - radio in terms of ads
92:58 - like compare it to the radio ads where
93:00 - they're yelling at you for like seven
93:02 - minutes of the 30. yeah um and then on
93:05 - the on the actual sponsorship side they
93:06 - really work like these sponsorships work
93:09 - whereas display ads and other things
93:11 - just haven't had the roi like the roi is
93:14 - there for the companies that believe in
93:15 - it yeah we've been able to really help a
93:18 - lot of businesses like that like
93:20 - a recent example that i was really
93:22 - stoked about was kubecon so
93:25 - the clouded community computing
93:26 - foundation has this conference every i
93:28 - guess a couple times a year sometimes in
93:31 - europe sometimes united states
93:32 - and uh we've been very good friends with
93:35 - the linux foundation over the years and
93:37 - then that also bleeds into the cloud
93:39 - native computing foundation
93:41 - and their conference kubecon which we've
93:43 - gone to we love going there we're
93:44 - actually going back this year gerhard
93:46 - lazu is representing us this year so
93:47 - that's awesome
93:49 - but
93:50 - we have just ran some promos for them to
93:52 - promote hey if you're thinking about
93:54 - attending use our code save 10 percent
93:56 - get the early bird pricing for extended
93:58 - times whatever it might be
94:00 - and you know join this kind of community
94:01 - and
94:02 - and help them share the invitation with
94:04 - the larger community
94:05 - and their feedback to us was like your
94:08 - code was the most used
94:10 - over all the people that we used in
94:12 - these promotional ways and i just love
94:14 - that because
94:16 - for one everybody attending is to save
94:18 - ten percent but then two like it it's
94:20 - proof
94:21 - that we actually can help
94:23 - uh willing community people in in the
94:26 - software world to
94:28 - uh hear something on a podcast and
94:30 - actually take action and and it's not
94:31 - like
94:32 - i'm selling jared something he doesn't
94:34 - want with money he can't he doesn't have
94:35 - or even something generic right like if
94:37 - i'm listening to go time and i hear an
94:39 - ad for kubecon like i'm super interested
94:41 - in kubecon like oh great it's coming up
94:43 - it's going to be in brussels so i'm not
94:44 - sure where it is but you know answer
94:46 - that amsterdam
94:47 - go to that these are not burger king ads
94:49 - or right crest you know we've considered
94:51 - the impossible burger ad though
94:55 - no i'm just kidding i'm just kidding
94:57 - so anyway that was a joke it's proven to
94:59 - be a very viable model for for you know
95:02 - it really is a win-win-win just to use
95:04 - michael scott's phrase because the
95:06 - sponsors do and our partners win because
95:09 - of the results like that we win because
95:10 - we're making a living off of it and our
95:12 - listeners get free shows consistently
95:15 - quality content right and they you know
95:18 - we put out 60 to 90 minute shows and
95:20 - you're gonna listen to two or three ads
95:22 - in a 90-minute show we're not asking
95:25 - very much
95:26 - and those ads are incredibly pointed and
95:28 - valuable like it's content it's like oh
95:30 - that's interesting i i'm i'm interested
95:32 - in that so it's not annoying it's yeah
95:34 - so i think everybody wins i like the
95:36 - model and that's like what they found
95:38 - with advertising is if it's relevant
95:40 - then it's less
95:41 - irksome right and in this case with
95:44 - podcasts podcasts can be hyper targeted
95:46 - like this is a podcast about open source
95:49 - software right i mean you could never
95:51 - get that level of grading reality with
95:53 - like
95:54 - tv that's right yeah that's why some of
95:56 - the larger more mainstream podcasts
95:57 - struggle
95:59 - with the sales to the sponsors because
96:01 - they don't have the targeted audience
96:02 - they have huge audiences but they aren't
96:04 - targeted so you'll hear a lot of
96:05 - mainstream ones like even mainstream
96:07 - tech like the verge cast which is a
96:09 - pretty mainstream tech news and
96:10 - commentary show they will you'll hear
96:12 - them asking their listeners to take
96:14 - surveys and stuff because they have a
96:16 - more generic mainstream listener base
96:19 - they don't know exactly who they're
96:20 - talking to
96:21 - well when you have a show called go time
96:24 - about the go programming language and
96:26 - kubernetes and these things you know
96:28 - exactly who's listening to that show
96:30 - yeah and so you don't have to survey
96:31 - them you know
96:33 - that's the value of a niche yeah
96:35 - speaking of go time i think this is a
96:37 - perfect opportunity
96:38 - for me to ask at what point so you had
96:40 - the change log yeah
96:42 - that is the granddaddy of uh open source
96:46 - podcast we call it our flagship show
96:48 - that's a flagship show
96:50 - and now you have several you have
96:53 - several that were shorter period like
96:55 - request for commits which was one of my
96:56 - personal favorites yeah uh learned a ton
96:59 - from that one me too um but how did you
97:02 - go about creating additional shows and
97:04 - and how do those all work
97:07 - let me take this one
97:09 - go for it okay
97:10 - so we have been working with uh brian
97:13 - kettleson and eric st martin of of
97:15 - gophercon uh it was their
97:18 - second year actually i think the reason
97:20 - we even did the show
97:21 - it begins because brian kettleson hopped
97:24 - in our issues
97:25 - and and github in our pink we had a ping
97:27 - repo where we would say hey community if
97:29 - you have some ideas suggestions whatever
97:31 - we've since moved it to different ways
97:33 - but we used to have a repo on our github
97:37 - org called ping
97:38 - which is that's another win thing
97:40 - honestly
97:41 - he's so awesome but uh
97:45 - brian kelson reached out to us on our
97:47 - issues there and said hey
97:49 - if you haven't thought about it yet you
97:50 - should come to gophercon this is our
97:52 - invitation to you and that's what i love
97:54 - about brian too is he's like he is like
97:56 - the
97:57 - uh the mack daddy of like
97:59 - and you can i'm showing my age here too
98:01 - because that's that's
98:03 - a 90s thing he's the mack daddy of like
98:05 - inviting people in right i love that
98:07 - about brian and eric uh and he he
98:10 - reached out to us we had them on the
98:12 - changelog talking about gophercon they
98:14 - invited us up to their conference we
98:16 - went out there and did some fun stuff if
98:18 - you go to change.com films you'll
98:20 - probably see some cool stuff we've
98:21 - actually done some video work there with
98:23 - them and
98:24 - and and whatnot and so we just sort of
98:26 - fell in love with the go community you
98:28 - know they're
98:29 - really i would say different than other
98:31 - communities because they just they just
98:32 - seem very
98:34 - it's like once you i don't know how to
98:37 - describe it maybe you can help me jerry
98:38 - but just very
98:40 - very protective
98:42 - and very close tight-knit very
98:44 - tight-knit yeah enthusiastic yeah and
98:47 - it's like once you're in you're in and
98:49 - we just loved uh their you know that
98:52 - conference uh everyone who went through
98:54 - it we just loved how people
98:56 - collaborated and mingled together and
98:57 - had fun together it was just such a fun
98:59 - conference and i don't know if it was
99:01 - the conference and the community but we
99:02 - just sort of fell in love with that
99:04 - we're like well once we we always had
99:06 - desires to expand we're like well the
99:08 - next one we do makes sense to be
99:11 - a go podcast of sorts
99:13 - but jared you came up with a name so i
99:15 - mean
99:16 - take it take it from there yeah what an
99:17 - amazing name it is too it's go time it's
99:20 - go time yeah it seems obvious in
99:21 - retrospect uh naming is one of my
99:23 - favorite things
99:24 - naming things is hard as we all know as
99:26 - developers
99:27 - and so i love to do it because i like
99:29 - challenges and
99:31 - sometimes it takes a thousand bad names
99:33 - for one good one to be born and we've
99:34 - definitely been through those thousand
99:36 - bad names because we have a portfolio of
99:38 - shows now in addition to just the go
99:41 - thing happening
99:43 - we have with the changelog one
99:44 - opportunity a week to to spot to
99:47 - spotlight something
99:49 - and we it's very polyglot as you know as
99:51 - a listener we don't have i mean open
99:53 - source is kind of the crux of the matter
99:55 - but we even go beyond that and and we've
99:57 - even changed the word to software
99:58 - development in terms of the things that
100:00 - we talk about because
100:01 - uh even though open source basically
100:03 - permeates all software development
100:05 - it's bigger than just open source even
100:07 - now just because our interests have
100:08 - grown over the years that being said
100:10 - that's 50 weeks a year that's 50 shows a
100:12 - year if you take a couple weeks off
100:14 - and there's so much more things to talk
100:16 - about there's so much more things to
100:17 - spotlight and we had a lot of listeners
100:19 - who's like hey i love the changelog i
100:21 - would love to hear more but more about
100:23 - this topic
100:24 - or more about that topic because if we
100:25 - covered go or a specific language even
100:29 - for four weeks straight to be like well
100:30 - did this turn into a go podcast or are
100:32 - you still
100:33 - sort of multifaceted like you like you
100:35 - say you are and so
100:37 - you have to there's one way you can
100:38 - diversify you can either diversify and
100:40 - add more shows to that particular
100:42 - podcast and just diversify
100:44 - by i guess multiplication
100:47 - just picking some words dividing by
100:49 - multiplying
100:50 - yeah
100:51 - you know we could ship more shows a week
100:53 - long but then we would have to have like
100:55 - series and like people do seasons
100:57 - there's lots of different ways of
100:58 - slicing it
100:59 - but what we thought would be a lot
101:01 - cooler is instead of the two of us doing
101:03 - more shows because you hear our voices
101:05 - all the time anyways and we're here to
101:06 - spotlight the guest like we want more
101:08 - voices that's what we've always been
101:10 - about when we have the opportunities
101:12 - like more voices more people different
101:14 - voices than ours
101:15 - and so let's you know exp let's extend
101:18 - our network and our production skills
101:21 - and our the tastes that we have and the
101:23 - interest that we have to other people
101:25 - and let's enable them to do shows and so
101:27 - that's what really became the portfolio
101:29 - now some of us are on like i'm on js
101:31 - party regularly adam has a show called
101:33 - brain science that's himself and muriel
101:36 - reese and so it's not like we're not on
101:37 - those shows but we don't you know it's
101:39 - not like the change they're different
101:41 - shows they're different people and we've
101:42 - been able to expand the number of voices
101:45 - on our network to much larger than ours
101:47 - and so that's pretty cool i think yeah
101:49 - and one thing that i think is really
101:51 - cool is you figured out ways to take
101:53 - that kind of like cool fractal logo
101:55 - and create variations of like radial
101:58 - symmetry yep um
102:01 - each
102:01 - i mean i'm wearing the changelog shirt
102:03 - yeah this is my new one by the way
102:06 - my old ones right here that uh i got
102:08 - four years ago it's been washed about a
102:10 - hundred times but for everybody who's
102:11 - watching love it
102:13 - this is what it looked like this is in
102:15 - the you've even got a framed one over
102:16 - here
102:17 - uh but yeah
102:20 - adam sent me this after i was on the
102:21 - changelog that was your old school
102:23 - credentials right there yeah that's
102:24 - right the og og
102:27 - yeah but the way that you've branded
102:29 - them all and they've all got really cool
102:31 - short punchy names and uh
102:34 - and they have kind of a consistent sound
102:36 - and a big part of that cohesive
102:37 - consistent sound is
102:39 - brakemaster cylinder yeah can you tell
102:42 - us about brake master cylinder not much
102:44 - because we don't know much honestly
102:46 - what's the mysterious the mysterious
102:48 - great master cylinder well you know
102:51 - it's interesting because i obviously
102:53 - heard of brake master cylinder through
102:56 - gimlet media and the work they've done
102:58 - with reply all and startup and other
103:02 - shows so that's where i learned a
103:03 - barbecue master cylinder
103:05 - and
103:06 - just one crazy night on the internet
103:08 - like most things happen i was like
103:11 - just figuring out break master cylinder
103:13 - you know the kind of stuff they're into
103:15 - or whatever
103:16 - and i'll i turn up their website and
103:18 - there's like an invite to reach out and
103:20 - i didn't i thought was like typical
103:22 - contact me kind of scenarios where you
103:24 - reach out and they just never talk to
103:26 - you right there's no response well like
103:28 - the very next day brakemaster gets in
103:30 - touch and says i love what you're doing
103:32 - let's work together
103:34 - i didn't expect that uh that turns us
103:36 - into the scenario where jared and i are
103:38 - sort of riffing with breakmaster on some
103:39 - different ideas for
103:41 - brand new
103:42 - music for the changelog podcast and i
103:45 - think was a good time no time in rc and
103:48 - the reason why go time was so important
103:49 - so this was kind of a
103:51 - a milestone for for me or like okay
103:53 - we're going to do this for real because
103:55 - up until this point so the original
103:57 - change dog had the california song which
103:59 - is has a tight story with adam uh and a
104:02 - band that he knows and all that but then
104:03 - we also just had some like adam would go
104:05 - out onto i don't know sound forest or
104:07 - what are these websites like yeah like
104:08 - the the sound equivalent of the forest
104:10 - premium beat yeah and just buy something
104:12 - you know and you get it it's a royalty
104:14 - or it's a you pay a license yeah but
104:16 - it's not an exclusive license and so he
104:18 - would just pick music he likes we put
104:20 - that at the front of our shows that
104:21 - would be our theme song it was like that
104:22 - for a very long time and in fact when we
104:23 - expanded from just the changelog go time
104:25 - was our second show when we did go time
104:28 - adam found this song that was
104:31 - sorry it's all right don't worry it was
104:33 - uh beloved and it was probably on the
104:36 - first i don't know 10 to 20 episodes yep
104:39 - enough people were like don't change
104:42 - anything yeah so we had some resistance
104:43 - on that one but what happened was
104:45 - because it's just a sound clip that you
104:47 - can buy a license to anybody can do that
104:49 - and it showed up in a commercial
104:52 - what commercial was that disney yeah
104:53 - disney so somebody was tasteful one of
104:56 - the go time listeners is like why is the
104:57 - go time theme song on this disney
105:00 - commercial
105:01 - and we were like okay that was what it
105:03 - was like we have to get our own music
105:04 - yeah it was and it happened with our
105:06 - show or our uh music on the channel too
105:09 - it was
105:10 - a john deere commercial or a craftsman
105:13 - lawnmower commercial
105:15 - and it was like this grungy rock kind of
105:17 - uh
105:18 - and then also that that can put people
105:20 - off too if it's too rough
105:22 - it's not really inviting
105:24 - with everything about the music so what
105:26 - was funny about that was it become clear
105:28 - we weren't unique and right if we had
105:30 - licensed music we wouldn't be unique
105:32 - right so we started working with
105:33 - brakemaster cylinder and with the
105:35 - changelog and rfc which was uh a great
105:38 - show and had i think to this day the
105:40 - best the best music which we don't use
105:41 - now because that shows retired but we
105:43 - should somehow remix that uh it was
105:45 - green field like okay people knew the
105:48 - changelog song but we weren't trying to
105:49 - like they weren't in love with it so we
105:50 - could just start yeah and with new shows
105:52 - it's always brand new with go time the
105:54 - go time crew the listeners who as we
105:56 - said is a very tight-knit and
105:58 - enthusiastic and like very active
106:00 - audience they already loved this song
106:03 - and now we had to replace it with a
106:04 - custom song and so we asked brake pastor
106:07 - cylinder to basically like do a
106:08 - different version like make a remix of
106:10 - it make it break master but make it us
106:13 - but also make it kind of sound like the
106:14 - one that's already out there yeah and uh
106:16 - some people didn't even notice when we
106:17 - swapped it in but some people were mad
106:19 - some people yeah we always when brave
106:21 - master hands us anything to listen to
106:24 - i'm always like doesn't have enough bmc
106:26 - in it can you do it like these glitches
106:28 - like bmc's just break master children's
106:30 - is known for certain things yeah
106:32 - and we're like can you bring in some of
106:34 - these you know trademark break master
106:36 - cylinder stuff so we always love
106:40 - you know to speak
106:41 - very well of brave master cylinder we
106:44 - keep saying this name we don't know
106:47 - guy girl we're not sure
106:49 - if it's one person many people
106:52 - we've never met them we don't really
106:54 - have a first name basis at all besides
106:56 - maybe breakmaster that might be first
106:58 - name right just cutting off cylinders
107:00 - you know
107:01 - but they're in our slack so hey if you
107:04 - if you're out there you're like i want
107:05 - to talk to break master cylinder well go
107:07 - to change.com community doing that hop
107:10 - in our slack and
107:11 - dm or say hello that's just that easy
107:13 - but i'm always talking to breakmaster
107:15 - about different stuff we're working on
107:16 - or just catching up they'll just reach
107:18 - out and say hey how you doing and we'll
107:20 - have like a 20 minute conversation and
107:22 - like three weeks go by and that happens
107:24 - again or something like that so
107:25 - yeah but
107:26 - so easy to work with
107:28 - so not even like what i
107:30 - what often happens with creatives is
107:32 - they're very attached egotistically to
107:34 - what they've done like their creations
107:36 - are often a
107:38 - variation of their identity with break
107:40 - masters there's there's like a zero of
107:41 - that they just throw it out they're just
107:42 - like you don't like that cool let's keep
107:44 - breathing let's keep roofing let's go
107:45 - they're kind of yeah professional
107:47 - detachment from yeah artistic work
107:49 - always willing to like break master is
107:52 - the
107:52 - one of the scenarios where i can see
107:53 - they always deliver way more than you
107:56 - expect them to like they just want to
107:57 - keep delivering more and more value
108:00 - that's a that's a lesson to be learned
108:02 - always deliver more value to the people
108:04 - you're working with and
108:06 - if you can't code reviews are hard
108:08 - you're reviewing somebody's music that
108:09 - they're creating for you is incredibly
108:11 - difficult and it's custom and you don't
108:13 - even know we don't even have the
108:14 - language to describe you know and i i'm
108:17 - expecting from breakmaster's side
108:18 - similar to a code review or even a
108:20 - feature review with the user you can't
108:21 - spread that language too yeah you can't
108:23 - do that like you're almost offended by
108:25 - how
108:26 - juvenile you know the feedback is like
108:29 - yeah
108:30 - exactly so when you're trying to give
108:31 - feedback i can imagine from the other
108:33 - side like who are these fools you know
108:36 - like i don't like that hi-hat at eight
108:38 - seconds you know like whatever like how
108:39 - do you
108:40 - we're always like yeah it's not it's not
108:42 - grooving enough you know make it a
108:43 - little more poppy like the stuff you're
108:44 - saying it's very difficult so yeah very
108:46 - extreme grace and they're talking like
108:48 - time code and and uh
108:51 - and maybe even like majors or minors
108:53 - right or we're like take that
108:55 - wubble wubble take that wubble wubble
108:56 - out of there you know the naming is even
108:58 - cooler too like when brakemaster hands
109:00 - us new stuff to listen to
109:02 - it's always got these unique names
109:03 - attached to it and it's like this one
109:05 - with a little bump bump bump or
109:06 - something like like the the file name is
109:08 - literally named some really interesting
109:09 - stuff so it's just a
109:12 - a lot of fun work with breakmaster and
109:13 - and i'll say
109:15 - you know
109:16 - having
109:17 - having done all of our shows redone the
109:20 - song for the changelog and all that
109:22 - stuff like having only brakemaster
109:24 - cylinder stuff
109:26 - it would be a sad day in our history if
109:29 - we never got to have a break and i'm
109:31 - kind of getting a little bit weird about
109:32 - it but like if something ever happened
109:34 - to brakemaster and we couldn't ever work
109:36 - with them again for whatever reason
109:37 - whether it's
109:38 - they move on or something bad happens
109:40 - who knows i would be really it would be
109:43 - a day i'm worn like i love working with
109:45 - them and they produce the best stuff and
109:47 - we wouldn't use any other music besides
109:49 - breakmaster cylinder music
109:51 - that's a that's a pretty strong
109:52 - endorsement yeah
109:54 - yeah
109:55 - just because they're just so easy to
109:57 - work with they get our they get our dna
109:59 - they get our branding they get what
110:00 - we're trying to do and i just feel like
110:02 - they just add this
110:04 - this special flair that like you'd
110:06 - mention the artwork well there's a
110:07 - reason why because we we sat down in a
110:10 - room for two days basically in a bunker
110:11 - with jake stutzman and uh was it the
110:14 - guy's name
110:16 - micah yeah micah i can't remember his
110:17 - last name though like a frost or fost
110:20 - something like that can't recall but
110:21 - mike you're awesome too but we basically
110:23 - sat down and said hey who are we how can
110:26 - we understand uh what we want to be and
110:28 - how can we create a brand both a visual
110:30 - brand and a voice you know how we speak
110:33 - brand
110:34 - and you know from that we got our
110:36 - artwork we got these concentric circles
110:38 - we got this framework for developing new
110:40 - album art and then from that we also
110:43 - knew well if we're this unique here we
110:45 - have to be this unique in our music too
110:47 - you know the ways we audibly present
110:50 - ourselves
110:52 - yeah
110:53 - well it shows and and also the the
110:56 - design of
110:57 - the changelog.com
110:59 - uh
111:00 - that
111:01 - everything kind of reinforces that
111:03 - visual design that visual identity that
111:05 - you all have established for yourself
111:07 - and
111:08 - now
111:09 - i really want to learn more about the
111:10 - website my understanding is
111:13 - it's written in elixir it's snappy
111:16 - and
111:17 - it just has really good clear
111:19 - user experience like you
111:21 - know exactly what is going to happen
111:23 - when you click on different things and
111:24 - everything's pretty clear
111:26 - it for me it's been a real benchmark uh
111:29 - and and we've
111:30 - taken a lot of inspiration uh from it
111:32 - with with free code camp and and our
111:34 - recent um
111:36 - our recent efforts at at redesigning and
111:38 - simplifying and things like that so
111:40 - thank you yeah yeah
111:42 - who did most of the design like what's
111:45 - the story behind the platform
111:48 - so it's a everything's a team effort and
111:50 - i think uh one thing that you might
111:52 - notice through this conversation is that
111:53 - we do sweat the details we have a few
111:55 - sayings that we use internally one is
111:58 - uh slow down to move faster
112:00 - uh we also say uh what's the one stop
112:03 - slow
112:05 - well slow and steady wins the race yeah
112:06 - a lot of stuff about being slow
112:08 - slow down and check yourself and check
112:10 - yourself that's my favorite yeah so yeah
112:12 - because we can get uh we can get moving
112:14 - to we can get out over our skis a little
112:16 - bit well all too often in anything you
112:18 - feel like especially when there's
112:19 - opportunity and you're ambitious
112:21 - all too often do the opportunities trump
112:24 - your ability to say no right and the
112:26 - next thing you know you're going in
112:27 - places you don't really want to for
112:29 - other reasons and it's like if you feel
112:31 - pulled
112:32 - in anything you're doing beyond your
112:34 - capacity slow down and check yourself
112:36 - right that's what we said that's right i
112:38 - got to do the hand like that slow down
112:39 - and check yourself yourself because if
112:41 - you have you know some dna and some
112:43 - guidelines so if we know that we want to
112:45 - you know slow down to move faster or
112:48 - retreat to attack or to
112:50 - slow down or slow and steady wins the
112:52 - race if we have those as sort of like
112:54 - underlying mantras to ourselves
112:56 - well time we get pushed beyond those
112:58 - yeah slow down and check yourself yeah
113:00 - and it's worth reminding ourselves of
113:01 - these things because we are in an
113:03 - industry that moves so fast yeah and the
113:06 - the pressure is to i mean move fast and
113:08 - break things as the unfortunate you know
113:10 - slogan of a major player in our industry
113:13 - uh which we don't like that saying at
113:15 - all
113:16 - um
113:17 - so slow down and
113:19 - and move faster that way even when you
113:20 - think about software development
113:21 - practices right like thinking things
113:23 - through up front is slower but you also
113:25 - move faster in the long run setting up
113:27 - that test harness right before you move
113:29 - on to writing the code is slower
113:32 - but you all you move faster in the long
113:33 - run i mean people who are tdd advocates
113:36 - they will say the same thing like you
113:37 - think through things first and you move
113:39 - a little bit slower and it seems like
113:40 - you're not getting that head of steam
113:43 - but you know two weeks from now two
113:45 - months from now two years from now
113:46 - you're moving a lot faster and so like
113:48 - the brand is an evidence of that it's
113:50 - like we took the time we slowed down
113:52 - spent two days in a room and then many
113:54 - more beyond that you know that was like
113:56 - the foundation of like building this
113:59 - system and this design
114:00 - and then we can extend it over time we
114:02 - can move faster on new things we have
114:04 - all this stuff in place
114:06 - and so a lot of the website is a result
114:08 - of those initial branding discussions a
114:10 - lot of the design is done either by jake
114:13 - or by cody peterson who is a long time
114:15 - contributor uh and really co-laborer
114:18 - with us on the project he does a lot of
114:20 - our front end a lot of our design work
114:22 - and then added on myself
114:24 - whether it's giving feedback or cranking
114:26 - out the code that renders the pages
114:29 - so i've done a lot of the actual
114:31 - software work on
114:33 - building the elixir app
114:35 - but everything we do is team efforts
114:41 - i think one interesting thing to note is
114:42 - uh
114:43 - is the fact that jared said earlier
114:46 - i was a pearl guy then i was a ruby guy
114:48 - and so i built the site in elixir
114:51 - i mean that this doesn't equate but
114:53 - maybe you can sure why
114:54 - yeah i mean so i've always like i've
114:56 - always been a polyglot and i like
114:58 - programming languages i like the go
115:00 - programming language even though i don't
115:01 - write it on a daily basis i liked uh i
115:04 - like
115:05 - i like a lot of languages and so i've
115:07 - never found one that didn't have any
115:09 - redeemable qualities
115:11 - i even like aspects of php even though
115:13 - it has probably less redeemable
115:15 - qualities and with regard to syntax than
115:17 - many others slight dig i like php too
115:22 - we talk to a lot of people about
115:23 - programming languages i mean that's one
115:25 - of the things about our work is we're
115:27 - exposed to everything
115:29 - in fact i was just thinking about
115:30 - something that came mainstream recently
115:32 - and i was like we did a show on that
115:34 - three years ago like not boasting but
115:36 - just like reality like we are uncovering
115:38 - things before they blow up in fact we
115:40 - have a changelog nightly one of our
115:42 - emails that goes out every single night
115:44 - it's whole point is to it automatically
115:46 - just gets the most start repos on github
115:49 - before they blow up is the idea or like
115:51 - right as they are and maybe those things
115:53 - are going to go on the greatness maybe
115:54 - they aren't we'll pick through them and
115:55 - try to find someone that are interested
115:56 - in interesting yeah but it's an
115:58 - indicator so we're just just because of
115:59 - what we do and and and
116:02 - uh our show we're just at the forefront
116:04 - and so we talk to a lot of people about
116:05 - programming languages
116:07 - and uh some people assume therefore
116:09 - we're like
116:10 - deep into these things or we adopt
116:12 - everything
116:13 - and it's like no like
116:16 - 99 of the stuff we hang up the call on a
116:18 - wednesday afternoon i'm like adam i
116:19 - gotta check this thing out because we
116:21 - just spent 90 minutes with person who's
116:23 - got something cool they created yeah
116:26 - and i'm excited because i get excited
116:27 - about you know cool stuff
116:29 - uh jam stack i remember actually i think
116:31 - that was the one where jam stacks be
116:33 - coming to be like a mainstream top
116:35 - you guys rebuilt your stuff in jam stack
116:37 - we did the show on jam stuff two years
116:39 - ago at least two and a half years ago
116:41 - and that's just because i saw this
116:43 - matching magazine i mean they were the
116:44 - really the ones that were forfeiting
116:45 - that with netlify we had the lfi team on
116:48 - we talked about jam stack and now it's
116:49 - becoming a thing that but then there's
116:51 - other things that we talk about and they
116:52 - don't become a thing so that's just a
116:55 - fact of how the industry works
116:57 - point is we don't like then adopt all of
116:58 - the stuff that we talk about that would
117:00 - be you know impossible and ridiculous to
117:02 - do but there are certain things that you
117:04 - know catch your eye and almost nothing
117:07 - do i follow up on because we move on to
117:09 - the next week or the next show
117:10 - and we have other things to do but
117:12 - elixir actually did
117:14 - catch my eye and i tried it
117:17 - and i fell in love with it
117:18 - and i wanted to use it
117:21 - and so that's why i was writing an
117:22 - elixir and it extends from ruby like it
117:25 - takes yeah it takes a lot of information
117:26 - created by
117:28 - a prominent member of the ruby community
117:30 - and so it
117:32 - it looks rubyish when you look at it but
117:35 - the more you get into it yeah but it's
117:36 - not ruby it's interesting it's almost
117:38 - kind of like there's this uh dna that
117:41 - goes back to pearl through ruby and now
117:43 - to elixir
117:44 - yeah and the thing about the elixir uh
117:46 - combination there is it's like a i
117:49 - wouldn't call it a facade
117:50 - but it's more like a carrot on a stick
117:52 - like it's like uh
117:54 - it's like something that attracts you
117:55 - and you're like ooh this is interesting
117:57 - and then as you figure it out you're
117:59 - like actually this isn't what i thought
118:00 - it was but it's still very interesting
118:02 - it's almost like i mean calling it
118:04 - lipstick would be
118:05 - another bad analogy but there's
118:06 - something to it where the ruby
118:08 - relationship is there because jose who
118:10 - created elixir
118:12 - knows ruby inside out and he knows all
118:14 - the best stuff and so when you see it it
118:16 - almost looks like ruby code but then
118:17 - when you start to learn it you realize
118:19 - oh this is something completely entirely
118:21 - different and yet i feel at home even
118:23 - though i'm in a completely new paradigm
118:25 - which is functional programming
118:27 - yeah
118:29 - changelog.com of course is open source
118:31 - you've got a whole lot of contributors
118:33 - not only contributing to that platform
118:36 - itself but also contributors who are
118:38 - hosting shows yeah
118:40 - who are some of the key people within
118:42 - the changelog somebody to name
118:45 - somebody a name so many we've mentioned
118:47 - a few by name cody peterson is a key
118:49 - player on the website with the brand
118:51 - with the design work jake
118:53 - was crucial to developing the changelog
118:56 - brand guidelines and the album art
118:59 - bmc we talked about in great great depth
119:02 - gerhard you mentioned gerhart is going
119:04 - to kubecon on our behalf he's been
119:06 - working with us for a couple of years on
119:08 - infrastructure really helping us
119:10 - uh roll out since well i guess when we
119:12 - first brought the site on 2016 on node
119:15 - yeah exactly so i didn't really unders i
119:18 - didn't really know how to roll out an
119:19 - elixir app uh in a way that was
119:21 - uh
119:23 - old school i'm very old school like ssh
119:25 - into the box and like you know run uh to
119:28 - start apache or index by hand
119:31 - and that just uh
119:32 - isn't really the smart way to do things
119:34 - if you can do them better so gearheart
119:35 - has really helped us pave the way of
119:36 - like doing smart ways of rolling out uh
119:39 - our infrastructure over the years and uh
119:42 - is going to be representing us at
119:43 - kubecon which is very cool so thanks to
119:45 - gerhard
119:46 - um
119:47 - and then as you said we have more than
119:49 - just our one show now so we have a
119:50 - couple shows which are panel shows and
119:53 - we love the variety there so js party
119:55 - which is all about javascript and the
119:56 - web has nine regular panelists
120:01 - myself being one of them any particular
120:03 - episode has three or four people on it
120:05 - sometimes it was a guest so we just kind
120:07 - of like mix and match
120:09 - really borrowing from the the cheers
120:11 - model as i call it remember the show
120:13 - cheers yeah where you just want to go
120:14 - where everybody knows your name the idea
120:16 - there is is that
120:18 - you're at a party or you're at a meeting
120:20 - go time's the same way by the way now um
120:22 - you go to a place where you want to hang
120:24 - out with people and it's like it doesn't
120:25 - have to be the exact same voices every
120:26 - single time but there's like regulars
120:29 - and there's that familiar voice and
120:32 - it's a place to go where you're going to
120:33 - get variety but you're also going to get
120:35 - familiarity just like cheers when you go
120:37 - to the bar
120:38 - and go back and watch the show some
120:40 - episodes are out this person some are
120:41 - about that person and so that's really
120:43 - the model that we came up with for js
120:45 - party which is
120:47 - like
120:48 - they don't have to be the exact same
120:49 - hosts every single time but you should
120:51 - have regulars and so we have nine people
120:53 - who kind of just like mix and match and
120:55 - then we invite guests uh we could
120:57 - definitely name each and every one of
120:58 - those
120:59 - uh i just go good luck yes
121:02 - i don't even know
121:03 - i mean i know the names but yes i don't
121:04 - have them in my mind
121:06 - for us to book dj good job kevin ball
121:08 - goes by kay ball
121:10 - nick niecy who's a fellow omahan
121:12 - uh is on the show boy
121:14 - oh wait that's his
121:16 - uh tag line chris hiller
121:18 - yep christopher hiller bone skull he's
121:20 - the the one of the maintainers of the
121:22 - mocha js test library
121:25 - um
121:26 - divya sasidaran yep
121:28 - short div on twitter she's awesome she's
121:30 - on the show have we gotten to nine yet
121:32 - myself
121:33 - uh
121:34 - emma vaticand emma vatican
121:37 - yep and i think that rounds it out for
121:39 - now
121:40 - i was counting my rogers
121:42 - michael rogers yeah see i was counting
121:44 - on my fingers but it wasn't actually
121:45 - counting i was just doing the ritual
121:47 - yeah yeah and so i lost count
121:49 - rachel white who hasn't been back but
121:51 - she's trying to come back yep uh it's
121:53 - been a while she's been on but i love
121:55 - hearing from her as well she's got an
121:56 - awesome laugh i love her life
121:58 - uh and so much fun too i'll try go times
122:01 - geez i'm gonna probably stumble on some
122:03 - of these matt ryer of course uh
122:06 - i love matt
122:08 - uh
122:09 - john calhoun johnny borsuko
122:11 - carmen ando
122:13 - uh ashley mcnamara
122:16 - jbd
122:19 - that's six mark bates smart fates
122:24 - that's the cast i think so if i'm if i'm
122:27 - i might i think i feel like i'm missing
122:29 - one
122:30 - do you say johnny i did
122:32 - okay
122:34 - i should pull up the website well and
122:35 - obviously the original cast can't forget
122:37 - those guys
122:38 - carlesia pinto you got brian kettleson
122:41 - you got yorkshire martin now you know we
122:43 - started that show
122:44 - you know three how many years ago
122:47 - many years ago
122:48 - by 2015 maybe four 2016 we launched that
122:52 - show
122:52 - and you know we learned a lot of things
122:54 - from from ds party not to sort of
122:56 - explain why the cast is different but
122:58 - just to sort of like evolve that a bit
123:00 - we learned some things about js party
123:01 - and the fact that like this whole cheers
123:03 - motto that jared has just mentioned but
123:05 - it's
123:06 - it's really nice to hear more than just
123:08 - a few voices
123:09 - um and then also sort of what i look at
123:11 - is like representation of a community
123:14 - you know so rather than just you know
123:16 - one or two or three people that are
123:18 - always on the show why not have a
123:20 - rotating cast like we've learned from gs
123:21 - party but
123:22 - but one layer past that is like those
123:24 - are people that are out in that
123:26 - community sort of bringing their
123:27 - perspective to it
123:29 - and then even bringing in content or
123:31 - different topics that the three people
123:34 - or the two people or whatever don't
123:36 - always see it sort of gives you a larger
123:38 - more wider perspective and then also
123:41 - this opportunity of fresh voices more
123:43 - voices more representation
123:45 - and that's why that shows also evolved
123:47 - to sort of like borrow and learn from a
123:49 - lot of what jesus part has gotten right
123:51 - it's also worth pointing out as a
123:52 - podcast hack that in addition to all
123:55 - those things that we just described
123:56 - which are great virtues of that format
123:59 - is that we want to have great people on
124:01 - all of our shows and the thing about
124:03 - great people is they're very busy
124:06 - and so it's very difficult to get the
124:08 - same great people week by week at the
124:10 - same time to show up and do a show
124:12 - prepared and all the things are required
124:14 - to put together a good show
124:16 - so
124:17 - we learned that because we started those
124:19 - shows with less cat a smaller cast and
124:22 - so one of the things we adjusted it's
124:23 - worked out very well is like with three
124:25 - great people it's hard to get all three
124:26 - of those together all the time and so
124:27 - scheduling is one of the major
124:28 - challenges of podcasts another reason
124:30 - for pod pod fading with nine people
124:34 - so much easier we can get three people
124:35 - together out of nine yeah and and it's
124:37 - less pressure on us as panelists and
124:39 - even if they're unprepared or not as
124:41 - well prepared as they like to be it's
124:43 - not especially if you've got a lot of
124:45 - jelly or
124:46 - cohesion in the in the
124:48 - the folks involved it gets a lot easier
124:50 - to sort of like throw a show together
124:51 - last minute if if it came down to it
124:54 - right you know it's just a lot more
124:56 - flexible too
124:57 - yeah and less pressure on us as
124:59 - individuals so one of the things about
125:01 - the consistent evil podcast is let's
125:03 - face it you're just not excited to do it
125:05 - every single week
125:06 - or you have a conflict or that topic is
125:09 - not necessarily something you're into or
125:11 - that guest is somebody that's rubbed you
125:12 - the wrong way or what there's a thousand
125:14 - different reasons
125:15 - and if you're the only person that does
125:17 - the show well you're gonna do that show
125:18 - yeah right but if you have a cast of
125:21 - nine
125:22 - you know uh somebody could take a month
125:24 - off
125:25 - and the show goes on yeah and like we
125:27 - want the shows to go on and so that's
125:29 - one of the reasons that's the other
125:30 - reason why we've moved to in those
125:33 - particular shows a panel format also
125:35 - just to spread the burden because what
125:36 - would happen in this in that case isn't
125:38 - just that they
125:40 - couldn't show up is that they would feel
125:41 - guilty for not being able to right right
125:44 - and then that leads to a you know a
125:46 - spiral of burden burnout guilt all these
125:50 - things that sort of like plague us this
125:52 - sort of
125:53 - uh self voice saying you should do this
125:56 - or you should do that you should you
125:58 - know all these things that make you feel
126:00 - bad for not doing the things you want to
126:02 - do because you have ambitions you got a
126:04 - busy schedule or you got a new job or
126:05 - whatever it might be
126:07 - um we like that because somebody could
126:09 - be a panelist on one of our shows
126:11 - and take a quarter break you know like
126:13 - they've got a teaching thing or a new
126:15 - job spun up or they've got some travel
126:17 - planned no big deal
126:19 - it gets a lot easier to collaborate work
126:22 - with us because
126:23 - we're flexible you know we we're
126:26 - for lack of a better chance we say
126:27 - family first is the easy way to say that
126:29 - but yeah you know you both have kids
126:31 - yeah right so you can empathize with
126:34 - life like absolutely life period yeah i
126:36 - mean you got a sick kid you got vacation
126:39 - you got whatever you know going to see
126:41 - parents going to see family whatever it
126:43 - might be
126:44 - we want to bake that in so because i
126:46 - think what happens is you start to form
126:48 - relationships that get very rigid and
126:50 - very tested because you just can't
126:53 - measure up every time you're not excited
126:55 - about the topic you've got a busy
126:56 - schedule whatever it might be
126:58 - if you bake that flexibility into how
127:00 - things work now that those shows in
127:02 - particular work well now the change of
127:03 - jared and i essentially talking to
127:06 - somebody that has
127:07 - several shows where i can't show up or
127:08 - i'm busier or whatever might be it
127:11 - jarrah takes over no problem or i'll
127:13 - take a show by myself whatever but it's
127:15 - different for those shows that's not how
127:16 - we do those shows those shows that are
127:18 - more community-focused shows need that
127:21 - one it needs that community
127:21 - representation but then also that
127:23 - flexibility to enable people to say yes
127:26 - and be a part of it yeah there's
127:27 - something important there beyond
127:29 - changelog with regard to sustainability
127:32 - in your work because as you can tell we
127:34 - care about this work a lot
127:36 - and it's
127:37 - something that started as a hobby and
127:38 - was a passion and we're so passionate
127:40 - about the things that we're doing
127:42 - but we do not want to create a thing
127:44 - that then becomes our lives and defines
127:47 - us as humans and we wouldn't want that
127:49 - for any of our collaborators as well we
127:51 - live in an industry and we serve an
127:53 - industry that deals with burnout all the
127:56 - time yeah in fact
127:57 - i got sick of talking about i got burned
127:59 - out on talking about burnout because i
128:00 - just because all of our guests are
128:02 - people who are in this circumstance and
128:04 - they're all having the same terrible
128:05 - sort you know thing happened to them and
128:08 - uh you know it's a huge topic of
128:10 - conversation on our shows and in our
128:11 - industry in general because it's a thing
128:13 - that's happening on a way too frequent
128:14 - basis
128:15 - and we want to be in this for the long
128:17 - haul we we can't allow ourselves to burn
128:18 - out by
128:20 - going non-stop you know that's why it's
128:22 - one of the slow down to go faster right
128:24 - slow and steady wins the weights we have
128:26 - to remind ourselves that we it's okay to
128:28 - move a little bit slower because we have
128:30 - these other things yeah and so we try to
128:32 - maintain even though we have the
128:33 - complete flexibility flex flexibility
128:36 - and freedom to work all the hours or do
128:38 - whatever we want is like let's maintain
128:40 - a consistent schedule and not burden
128:42 - ourselves too much
128:44 - because that will first of all burn us
128:46 - out but also it's going to reflect onto
128:48 - the people who collaborate with us right
128:50 - and they're not full-timers right
128:52 - they're they have jobs they have open
128:53 - source projects they're coming on our
128:55 - shows because this is something they
128:56 - want to do yeah but you know that that
128:58 - can create like adam said the guilt and
129:00 - the
129:01 - shame the shame and like we don't want
129:03 - it we don't have anything to do with
129:04 - that stuff so so essentially through
129:05 - having just like a really
129:07 - like a lot of redundancy is the word i'm
129:09 - i'm hearing like you have a lot of
129:12 - people who
129:13 - can step in if somebody doesn't feel up
129:15 - for it or if somebody needs to take a
129:17 - break just by
129:19 - it's almost kind of like a a big
129:21 - distributed system in a way it kind of
129:24 - is yeah you've got like a pub sub system
129:26 - where right you publish and some people
129:28 - sub to that
129:30 - like they're like all right i'll take
129:31 - this gig here right coughing on this
129:33 - podcast yeah i mean for instance kubecon
129:35 - like we would love to be at kubecon the
129:36 - timing doesn't make as much sense adam's
129:39 - having a baby i've traveled a lot this
129:40 - year one of the things we do is we'll
129:42 - talk about conferences we limit our
129:43 - travel because that's another aspect
129:45 - like we love to go to conferences and be
129:47 - in the community love it a lot but we
129:49 - limit that ourselves because well every
129:52 - time we go to a conference we're leaving
129:53 - our family right okay so that's a
129:54 - circumstance where like we want to
129:56 - personally be at kubecon but that's not
129:58 - going to work out and so we have gerhard
130:00 - who's over in london doesn't get to come
130:02 - to the states as often it's going to be
130:03 - in san diego he'd love to have a trip to
130:05 - san diego and he's going to be there and
130:07 - and so that's a situation where it's
130:09 - like okay that makes sense and we've
130:12 - just kind of slowly you know built these
130:14 - relationships with folks where
130:16 - uh
130:16 - it's a win-win-win
130:18 - win but what's also cool too
130:20 - specifically with gerhart is that it
130:22 - gives us a chance to sort of like invite
130:24 - him in further to the fold like he's
130:26 - already worked with us and done tons of
130:28 - amazing things for us to help us with
130:30 - our infrastructure
130:31 - but from a content perspective we've had
130:33 - him on the show we've talked about
130:35 - change law's infrastructure but nothing
130:36 - specific to like giving him
130:39 - more opportunity so to speak yeah and so
130:41 - this was a chance for us to say hey we
130:43 - can't make it there and rather than
130:44 - being like oh we just won't go or you
130:47 - know we're stretching our limits and
130:50 - going and burning and trying to go like
130:52 - well who would be better to go for us
130:54 - and and also have other wins
130:57 - or win wins behind behind the thing so i
131:00 - mean i love the fact that one gerhard is
131:02 - ready to go and he's excited because i
131:05 - see him behind the scenes and the emails
131:06 - and stuff like that planning his trip
131:08 - and he's fired up right and so a year
131:11 - from now we may have a whole new thing
131:12 - we're talking about because
131:14 - of these
131:15 - you know the you know just like with the
131:17 - drill sergeant this invitation to come
131:18 - in gerhard's already a leader in other
131:20 - ways it's not we're inviting the
131:21 - leadership it's right it's the
131:22 - invitation into into the family deeper
131:25 - you know more things and we think of it
131:27 - like a family really i do and i know
131:29 - jared as well yeah that's great to give
131:31 - people opportunities to uh just take on
131:33 - more and more responsibilities and also
131:35 - just
131:36 - to travel yeah yeah and and truth be
131:39 - told he'll speak much better about
131:40 - kubernetes than i will yeah
131:42 - just saying
131:43 - so
131:44 - on the topic of conference just real
131:46 - quick
131:47 - you all do go to a lot of conferences
131:48 - yeah and i'm glad to hear that you have
131:51 - uh recognized that you don't want to go
131:53 - to all the conferences right because we
131:54 - want to go to all but we don't want to
131:56 - yeah yeah exactly yeah and the same
131:59 - thing with me like i just uh need to
132:01 - spend time with my family too and and
132:03 - the travel time and especially depending
132:05 - on where you're going the jet lag yep
132:06 - has consequences as well so what are
132:09 - some conferences that you
132:11 - all try to make it to
132:13 - regularly or what would you say yeah
132:14 - that's that's the first question i'll
132:15 - ask you another question about
132:16 - conversation in a second
132:18 - so i would preface by saying that our
132:20 - circumstances are unique
132:22 - similar to education where each person's
132:24 - different so when it comes time to like
132:26 - pick a conference go to a conference you
132:27 - have to ask yourself what are you trying
132:28 - to get out of the conference like what
132:30 - are your goals and that will inform
132:31 - which ones are a good fit because
132:33 - there's so many shapes and sizes
132:35 - for us
132:37 - i line it up with the change log the
132:39 - show which is broad and polyglot and
132:43 - open source focused and community
132:45 - focused and so we try to find
132:48 - conferences that are along those lines
132:49 - also because we only get to go to a
132:51 - couple a year
132:52 - you know we kind of say like maybe four
132:54 - a year once a quarter makes sense we
132:55 - don't always hit that fall time seems to
132:57 - be like there's lots of conferences in
132:58 - the fall so we tend to go a little bit
133:00 - more than is that we tend to go a little
133:02 - bit bigger conferences because we want
133:03 - to meet more people right we want to see
133:05 - more listeners or meet people that can
133:07 - become listeners and so uh staples for
133:09 - us i mean the the staple for us has been
133:11 - ozcon yeah yeah we've gone up
133:13 - o'reilly's oscon the last four years
133:15 - straight i think maybe three yeah yeah
133:18 - since 2016 every year yeah so oscar's
133:21 - the big one um
133:23 - it's always about
133:24 - kubecon we've been this will be our
133:26 - third year back
133:28 - and then um gopher gone go for con and
133:31 - all things all things open
133:33 - and and oscar and all things open have a
133:34 - lot in common i would say yeah gophercon
133:37 - is obviously a language-oriented
133:39 - conference so it's different than the
133:40 - other ones yeah and then kubecon is
133:42 - obviously kubernetes and all the cloud
133:45 - native which is a big thing yeah but
133:47 - it's not as like
133:49 - cross-sweeping as as as the open source
133:51 - focused ones so those are the ones that
133:52 - we always try to get to
133:54 - um non-interactive two we've i've went
133:56 - to that one one time
133:58 - kabal went there last year and i think
134:00 - nick's going there this year so this is
134:01 - our third time going to it's changed to
134:04 - the name of it so i think this year's
134:06 - iteration is just node i don't know if
134:08 - it's known interactive or not but it's
134:09 - always been just notice known as node
134:11 - interactive but since javascript and
134:15 - node and the
134:16 - js foundation and jquery foundation have
134:19 - sort of like changed and merged and
134:21 - stuff like that it's it had some naming
134:23 - changes too
134:24 - so awesome and my other question
134:27 - regarding conferences would be
134:29 - what would be your advice to somebody
134:31 - out there who's listening who has been a
134:32 - developer or is getting into software
134:34 - development because you all know a lot
134:36 - about different conferences out there
134:38 - yeah what would be a good
134:39 - first conference and what would your
134:41 - advice be to them if they wanted to
134:43 - attend one of those conferences
134:45 - so
134:46 - first i will small plug we have an
134:47 - entire episode of js party called the
134:49 - conference scene
134:51 - which we do we do an hour or four of us
134:53 - about this specific topic so go listen
134:55 - to that if you want the long-winded
134:57 - version sure short link to that yeah
134:58 - cool so short-winded and my advice would
135:01 - be pick something a small single track
135:04 - the cool thing about single track is
135:06 - that you don't have any decisions to
135:07 - make because the less you know the
135:09 - harder it is to make decisions what do i
135:11 - want to go you know and there's the fomo
135:14 - of like there's three tracks which i
135:16 - might miss the good thing
135:18 - a single track has a shared experience
135:20 - everybody saw the exact same thing and
135:22 - so it's a much easier to make
135:23 - conversation yeah because you saw the
135:25 - exact same talk that person did and you
135:27 - don't have to say hey did you hear what
135:28 - chris coyer said they're like no i was
135:30 - in the other track oh okay we can't be
135:32 - friends right so awkward yeah so single
135:35 - track is great for people just getting
135:38 - in like for your first conference
135:40 - smaller size is great because it's just
135:43 - less intimidating more one-on-one
135:45 - opportunities um so you know 200 people
135:48 - fought to 500 versus like a 5 000 person
135:50 - convention so 200 is really tight yeah
135:52 - 500 is a little bit more loose but still
135:54 - small enough mm-hmm
135:56 - uh and then you know
135:58 - other aspects is like regional is fun
136:00 - because you don't travel as far so like
136:02 - it's less of a
136:03 - the worst thing is like well i spent a
136:04 - bunch of money i took three days off of
136:07 - work and i traveled across the country
136:09 - and i didn't have a good time right it's
136:11 - a little bit less risk if it's like well
136:12 - i drove an hour and attended one so i
136:15 - there's a community aspect to the local
136:17 - conferences if you have a language you
136:18 - like like if you're into javascript then
136:20 - you're going to find a javascript
136:22 - conference in your local region that's a
136:24 - great option
136:25 - um
136:26 - that would be my advice
136:28 - mine is very similar
136:31 - okay small conferences are cool
136:32 - especially start i got fond memories of
136:35 - actually
136:36 - uh
136:37 - future of web apps also known as foa uh
136:41 - 2010
136:42 - uh
136:43 - man met some awesome people allen branch
136:45 - steven bristol
136:47 - and several other people and like
136:48 - they've they were
136:50 - quintessential friends very influential
136:52 - i've gotten some of the best advice
136:54 - in my life from stephen bristol
136:57 - just because we literally met at a
136:59 - conference because we had a podcast
137:01 - called the web 2.0 show and they wanted
137:03 - to meet
137:04 - this these two dudes behind this show
137:06 - that didn't have a gigantic audience but
137:08 - just enough just enough is all it took
137:10 - and they became great friends and for a
137:13 - while there i was going to smaller
137:14 - conferences like that like lone star
137:16 - ruby conference a couple different uh
137:19 - javascript conferences i think js
137:21 - what was it uh texas js or
137:24 - something yes txjs
137:26 - was uh was started here that's somebody
137:29 - else uh
137:31 - on on jesus party
137:33 - started texas j house yeah uh alex
137:35 - sexton maybe yeah alex sexton
137:37 - um that's one more name for him
137:40 - i'm
137:42 - but the point is is just that
137:44 - i met some amazing friends like
137:47 - it maybe i was fortunate that
137:49 - you know just that conference i got to
137:51 - meet people at the same conference i
137:53 - also got to meet gary vaynerchuk and
137:55 - kevin rose we had a podcast about uh
137:58 - with them
137:59 - at that conference i happen to have lost
138:01 - my voice at that conference so i sounded
138:03 - like dmx
138:05 - and kevin said so which was pretty cool
138:07 - too but kevin rose gary vaynerchuk and a
138:09 - bunch of other fun people we've kathy
138:11 - sierra who's like a an icon in user
138:14 - experience and just i mean just amazing
138:16 - so i mean some really cool people over
138:18 - the years that
138:19 - uh you know it was a smaller conference
138:21 - maybe 500 people but you know i got to
138:23 - meet some really really good friends
138:25 - yeah personally so that's that's my
138:27 - personal experience from it
138:28 - awesome one piece of advice before we
138:30 - move on we those are advice on like
138:32 - which conferences to go to but when
138:34 - you're at the conference so nothing
138:35 - noteworthy ever happened when you stayed
138:37 - inside your comfort zone right you're
138:39 - not going to come back home and tell
138:40 - your significant other or your friends
138:42 - some great story because you went to a
138:43 - conference and you attended some talks
138:45 - and you didn't talk to anybody and then
138:46 - you went to the hotel then you flew home
138:48 - or whatever the logistics were right
138:50 - parties you have to actually push
138:52 - yourself outside of your comfort zone
138:54 - and it's not going to feel good because
138:56 - that's what comfort zone means right
138:58 - but
139:00 - this is your opportunity to meet you
139:01 - know people face to face in the flesh
139:04 - whether it's someone you look up to or
139:06 - somebody who is sitting by themselves
139:08 - and needs someone to talk to like if
139:09 - you're going to go to the conference
139:11 - like we can get virtual conversations
139:13 - all day long we get them
139:15 - and they aren't always that great as
139:16 - evidenced by the conversations that we
139:18 - have online but in conferences
139:20 - face-to-face you can have amazing
139:21 - conversations with amazing people but
139:23 - not if you just go and you're a
139:24 - wallflower yeah and so if you're going
139:26 - to go and you're going to put in the
139:28 - effort and the money and all these
139:29 - things
139:30 - you have to push yourself outside your
139:31 - comfort zone otherwise you're not going
139:32 - to get out of it which you can yeah i
139:35 - got one more uh extra on top of that not
139:37 - just that but
139:38 - we learned from eric holster
139:40 - this thing called the pac-man rule right
139:42 - so if you're you know this one i've
139:45 - never heard this no okay i'll give you
139:46 - the short version there's a whole
139:48 - podcast about it we'll point back to
139:49 - we'll add more links to the show notes
139:51 - but
139:51 - uh eric holster was a big fan of
139:54 - inviting people and including people and
139:56 - if you're if you can imagine
139:58 - uh being at an after party or some or in
140:00 - the hallway track whatever it might be
140:02 - and you got a circle of people and
140:04 - there's no openings you don't feel
140:05 - invited to come in right you don't get
140:08 - invited to come into that space so if
140:10 - you leave that wedge there that pac-man
140:12 - shape well there's room for one or two
140:14 - more and as they and the circle just get
140:16 - bigger and bigger but you always have
140:17 - that gap in there to invite people in so
140:20 - he gave uh talks about it he wrote a
140:22 - blog post about it we had a podcast
140:24 - about the talks and the blogs and that
140:26 - just you know inception now you're
140:27 - having a podcast about the podcast
140:28 - that's right that's right
140:30 - but the point is is like you know if
140:32 - you're at a conference
140:34 - describing jared's scenarios one more
140:36 - layer to that is like always leave space
140:38 - to invite one more into the ground if
140:40 - you're staying in a circle look around
140:41 - and see if you can make more of a
140:43 - pac-man shape because that invites one
140:45 - more person in
140:46 - yeah so that's a great tip yeah i've
140:48 - heard like kind of keeping your body
140:49 - language open where you keep your feet
140:51 - out yeah point your toes pointed out
140:53 - um that that also makes people feel more
140:56 - welcome also just saying hi yeah
140:59 - hey how are you that's a good tip yeah
141:01 - looking at people making eye contact
141:02 - with them yeah yeah well these are they
141:05 - seem like obvious things but they aren't
141:06 - easy and we've all been in the awkward
141:08 - circumstance where like you're
141:09 - approaching a circle and there's no gap
141:11 - there and you're like do i what you know
141:14 - do i just hang out
141:16 - until they let me ease in right there's
141:18 - all these awkwardnesses it's already
141:20 - hard enough to get outside your comfort
141:22 - zone and like approach somebody who may
141:24 - reject you or whatever the fears are but
141:26 - when there's no like
141:28 - openness from the group it's even harder
141:30 - anyways we're rambling on i mean it
141:31 - takes me it took me years to get
141:33 - comfortable just approaching developers
141:35 - at a developer conference
141:36 - and uh now when i go to some
141:39 - non-developer thing where you know
141:41 - nobody knows anything about me or and
141:43 - i'm just like some interloper right then
141:45 - i have to reapply all those strategies
141:48 - again to like break into circles and
141:49 - talk to people yeah so it's hard every
141:51 - time yeah it gets easier but it's never
141:53 - easy yeah it's good practice though yeah
141:55 - for sure we're also in
141:57 - in many cases distributed environments
141:59 - or very virtual environments so
142:02 - the awkwardness is going to be there
142:04 - it's going to be there so
142:06 - i guess just own it
142:08 - embrace it embrace it
142:10 - yeah speaking about speaking of
142:12 - embracing things
142:13 - uh you know you all have embraced a lot
142:15 - of changes right there at the beginning
142:16 - of the change log that's right name
142:19 - and
142:20 - you're heading into a new decade a new
142:22 - era of the changelog and uh you know it
142:25 - looks like the field is very open and
142:26 - you've got a lot of possible things you
142:29 - could do with the next 10 years
142:32 - what are some
142:35 - the ambitions or areas that you want to
142:38 - explore or
142:39 - charts you know
142:40 - courses that you've already charted that
142:42 - you're planning to head in that you can
142:43 - share with us
142:47 - i'm usually
142:49 - more visionary
142:51 - and have like some sort of cast but i
142:53 - feel like
142:54 - we're doing what we need to be doing
142:56 - right now
142:57 - and for me that's okay because
143:00 - i think we do a lot and
143:02 - you know i've got a growing family and
143:04 - so personally right now i feel like i'm
143:06 - a little short-sighted on my vision
143:08 - i like what we're doing i think there's
143:10 - a lot of things we can improve on we
143:11 - mentioned the fact that our co-base is
143:13 - open source
143:14 - uh every year we like to participate in
143:16 - oktoberfest we like to invite people in
143:17 - to contribute
143:19 - there's always room for more shows but
143:21 - we're also not trying to grow our
143:24 - podcast count tremendously i think over
143:26 - the next several years we might grow by
143:29 - one maybe two shows a year or
143:32 - basically as topics or interests
143:35 - you know kind of come to come to
143:36 - fruition
143:37 - i would um
143:40 - i would like to
143:42 - to maybe do a bit more on the membership
143:44 - side
143:45 - and then invite people in in that way
143:47 - because there's so many people to reach
143:48 - out and say how can we help you how can
143:50 - we support you and in all honesty the
143:51 - best thing we can say right now is like
143:53 - if you make lists of podcasts if you're
143:54 - on twitter if you tell somebody about
143:56 - your favorite things and we're one of
143:58 - those things that's the best way but for
144:01 - some people that's not enough right they
144:03 - they actually want for some reason to
144:05 - give you money or some sort of exchange
144:07 - of value and i think we got to find find
144:10 - out if it's not just money or some other
144:12 - ways we got to find some way to exchange
144:13 - value with our listeners beyond us
144:17 - freely giving our podcast to the world
144:18 - it's got to be something where they can
144:20 - come in and do something of value
144:22 - whether it's monetary whether it's
144:23 - contribution to the code base whether
144:25 - it's something involving in the
144:26 - community uh a lot of opportunity is
144:29 - also on the written side we'd love to
144:31 - find more people to share their big
144:32 - ideas uh through our platform so there's
144:35 - a lot of things i think in that area
144:37 - that would make sense to to to expand
144:39 - more growing by more podcast isn't that
144:41 - interesting to me right this very moment
144:43 - it's already hard yeah so
144:46 - i think we have a good portfolio i'm
144:48 - proud of it i think we serve a lot of
144:50 - niches i wouldn't say that we're
144:52 - comprehensive like every developer niche
144:54 - there are there are a couple of holes if
144:57 - i if you if you if you pin me down i
144:58 - could name a couple of holes in our
145:00 - lineup but
145:01 - um
145:02 - i think revisiting memberships at this
145:03 - point makes sense because of the
145:06 - kind of the sea change and the attitude
145:07 - towards memberships and i think we can
145:09 - provide unique value to a paid
145:11 - membership that we didn't provide back
145:13 - then i think there are people who would
145:14 - love to support us in that way
145:16 - especially if they get some add-ons and
145:18 - some maybe like an ad-free option or
145:21 - something like that
145:22 - create your own feed like these kind of
145:24 - ideas are things that we're tinkering
145:25 - with where we could revisit that and
145:28 - really serve more directly i mean i love
145:30 - the idea of like just directly serving
145:32 - your audience yeah you know every single
145:33 - time like the period security of that i
145:35 - don't think we would ditch our current
145:37 - model because this model works it's
145:38 - sustainable we've proven that out but we
145:40 - could augment and provide options uh so
145:43 - that's something that that we're
145:45 - interested in i think personally i agree
145:47 - with adam that i'm not
145:48 - like super stoked to add a bunch of new
145:50 - podcasts um maybe just focus on growing
145:53 - vertically versus horizontally at this
145:55 - point i in terms of my own interest i
145:57 - would love to do more writing
145:59 - um i've just in the last uh six months
146:02 - or so maybe even less been able to
146:04 - finally become full-time on changelog
146:05 - and
146:06 - slowly wind down my consulting company
146:09 - which was a long burn but we're like
146:10 - basically down there at that point so i
146:12 - can concentrate fully on changelog i
146:14 - have lots of
146:15 - things to say and and to write i just
146:17 - don't have often the time to write them
146:20 - and so i'd love to be able to execute on
146:21 - more of those opportunities and
146:24 - use use our writing as a way to
146:26 - uh
146:27 - really augment the shows and like bring
146:29 - people back to the shows so yeah let me
146:32 - let me say this to it real quick because
146:33 - you mentioned earlier with when jared
146:36 - came on to the team
146:37 - you know while you were speaking one
146:39 - thing i was thinking to an adjective to
146:41 - describe jared would be instrumental
146:43 - right like if it weren't for we didn't
146:45 - even talk about me going full time ever
146:47 - in this in this conversation which is
146:50 - it doesn't need to go that far but the
146:51 - point was was that jared was a source of
146:53 - encouragement for me he was like
146:55 - i was working at pure charity and so
146:57 - just a quick version of the story and
146:58 - this is
146:59 - basically me giving jared a long thank
147:01 - you
147:02 - is that uh an appreciation too because
147:05 - he's an amazing partner and i couldn't
147:07 - do this alone that this would not be
147:09 - what it is if it was adam solo
147:11 - uh it just wouldn't
147:13 - and i'm so thankful for jared but
147:15 - ages ago he was like dude we can do this
147:17 - you could do this you could do this
147:18 - whatever i forget the exact wording but
147:21 - but i've always been an entrepreneur but
147:23 - i wasn't like
147:25 - yeah i want to quit my job that's cushy
147:27 - because i was working for a non-profit
147:29 - it was amazing work i loved what we were
147:30 - doing i loved the team we were building
147:32 - i love what i was building i love what i
147:33 - was doing
147:35 - and then one day i just loved this a
147:36 - little bit more
147:37 - and i was like you know what you're
147:38 - right and then it for me
147:41 - a silent partner for me at least
147:43 - not a contributor to a show but a huge
147:45 - contributor to my life as my wife if it
147:47 - weren't for her if it weren't for jared
147:49 - encouraging me and saying you should do
147:51 - this we can do this and for my wife to
147:54 - agree
147:55 - uh and believe in me
147:57 - i wouldn't have done it
147:58 - honestly so thank you bro oh you're
148:01 - welcome and i'm glad that you made that
148:03 - leap because you know a few years later
148:05 - it's allowing me to make that leap i was
148:06 - already
148:07 - out there on my own at that point and so
148:09 - there was like i didn't have the the i
148:11 - mean we all know that resistance yeah of
148:13 - like when are you are you going to or do
148:15 - i or don't i or when do i
148:17 - and so
148:19 - i already had the confidence i was like
148:20 - you know i'm out here swimming in the
148:21 - water and everything's fine you know the
148:23 - water is warm out of stuff yeah and i
148:26 - was in that water and i was like i like
148:27 - that water too but now i've got this
148:29 - warm water and i just was less also you
148:32 - know newly married so it was just like
148:35 - timing but uh i i still have mad respect
148:38 - for pure charity the team that runs that
148:40 - i mean i still consider them all friends
148:42 - they do amazing things as a matter of
148:44 - fact a community member uh
148:46 - beverly nelson she's done some stuff
148:48 - with it's been a while she's been really
148:49 - busy but she is cto
148:52 - cto at pure charity she began
148:56 - i don't want to say just as a developer
148:58 - in a negative way but she kind of came
148:59 - in
149:00 - when we had a budding team she came and
149:03 - was very instrumental and i don't think
149:06 - then you know she would have believed
149:07 - that she would have been cto at some
149:08 - point now she's cto of pure charity
149:11 - that's awesome yeah and we love beverly
149:13 - she's amazing
149:14 - yeah well it sounds like you all have a
149:17 - lot of people
149:18 - who have been on the periphery or
149:20 - directly involved with the change log
149:22 - over the past 10 years
149:24 - and i
149:25 - want to wish you all
149:27 - a
149:28 - fun prosperous
149:30 - next 10 years to the life of the chinese
149:32 - vlog i'm going to be listening
149:34 - i know that a lot of the people in the
149:35 - free code camp community
149:37 - learn about
149:39 - open source and learn about software
149:41 - development in general and get
149:42 - introduced to a lot of the people whom
149:45 - you've interviewed uh you know dhh you
149:48 - had yehuda cats on a while back
149:50 - just a ton of really
149:52 - like developers developers
149:55 - um and they're able to uh get a lot of
149:58 - exposure to those people and a lot of
149:59 - inspiration for those people so i just
150:01 - want to thank you again for everything
150:02 - you're doing for the community and um
150:06 - you know long live the change log 10
150:08 - years
150:09 - 10 more years of awesome learning that's
150:11 - right well quincy thank you you've
150:12 - always been
150:15 - a staple for us to you've always
150:17 - encouraged us and congratulated us along
150:19 - along the way too we're obviously huge
150:21 - fans of free code camp we can't say it
150:22 - enough and we just thank you for
150:25 - caring enough about us for one to drive
150:28 - from your place to my place here in
150:30 - houston we are in for lack of better
150:32 - terms adam's studio yeah uh you know so
150:36 - he came here we flew jared in forever
150:39 - i mean this is your studio that's right
150:40 - that's right
150:41 - well i almost called it like you know
150:43 - change like hq but it's not bad
150:51 - but you know we really appreciate you
150:53 - know the time
150:55 - that you've put into this too the
150:57 - research
150:58 - and just sharing
151:00 - uh sharing your community with ours
151:02 - honestly we really really appreciate
151:04 - that we can't thank you enough
151:06 - all right well hey
151:07 - adam jared it's been an absolute blast
151:10 - everyone uh still with us thank you
151:12 - again for listening to the free code
151:15 - camp podcast
151:16 - uh
151:17 - be sure to check the show notes where
151:18 - we'll have links to a lot of the
151:19 - different episodes of the change log
151:22 - that we mentioned here and and some of
151:23 - the articles as well
151:25 - also if you're not subscribed to the
151:27 - change log be sure to subscribe to it
151:29 - the free code camp podcast will come
151:31 - back in early 2020
151:33 - we're just as i said doing a lot of
151:35 - other things but in the meantime if you
151:36 - can just tell your friends about the
151:37 - change log tell your friends about free
151:40 - code camp
151:41 - that would mean the world to us
151:44 - have a fun day and happy coding
151:50 - four years ago
151:52 - four years ago we talked to you
151:54 - and since then you have literally blown
151:56 - up in many good ways
151:57 - now if he literally blew up wouldn't he
151:59 - have exploded and his guts worn out okay
152:02 - figuratively literally
152:04 - jared's always i always do that to him
152:06 - he is although technically you're right
152:07 - literally can mean the exact opposite
152:09 - right well it depends what dictionary
152:11 - right in this case blowing up meaning
152:12 - that
152:14 - let's start over again gosh
152:16 - i was digging that flow oh you were yeah
152:18 - i would keep it then we'll keep it
152:20 - jared likes we'll keep it but but
152:22 - seriously four years ago we had a
152:23 - conversation with you much different
152:25 - free code camp today than four years ago
152:29 - what are you doing that's so great what
152:31 - are you doing that so well that has
152:32 - gotten you toward your ad not just you
152:34 - but the rest of everyone the
152:35 - contributors were pretty skeptical were
152:37 - we not
152:38 - i mean we tend to be at times skeptical
152:40 - we're paid to be yeah we're paying to be
152:42 - skeptical well there's lots of stuff
152:44 - that comes out and certain things last i
152:45 - think we're talking about that earlier
152:46 - in the other show
152:48 - by the way kind of a companion podcast
152:50 - going on right here so definitely listen
152:51 - to the other one as well
152:53 - links will be cross-posted that's right
152:55 - show notes check them out i mentioned
152:56 - that lots of stuff hits our radar and
152:58 - some things last and other things don't
153:00 - and i know one of the things we were
153:01 - talking about then four years ago now
153:04 - links in the show notes the original
153:06 - quincy larson episode
153:08 - apologies by the way it's been four
153:09 - years for us to get you back it should
153:10 - have been much faster yeah we usually
153:12 - have the be backs back sooner you're
153:13 - still here you've blown up you did not
153:16 - fail to sustain so so now you agree with
153:17 - you blew up i do okay good i do well i
153:20 - think the different stuff i'm guessing
153:22 - is that
153:23 - then was just one pillar
153:25 - right now you got many more people
153:28 - that happened
153:30 - why does that work
153:31 - yeah so
153:34 - 2014
153:35 - uh almost exactly five years ago we
153:38 - launched just the curriculum itself we
153:40 - had a chat room right uh so free people
153:42 - coming to free code camp
153:44 - and they work through the curriculum and
153:46 - they would ask questions in a chat room
153:49 - which was originally hip chat and then
153:50 - it was slack and then it was getter we
153:52 - still use getter but now the main thing
153:54 - is the forum so the curriculum was the
153:57 - the original pillar of freco camp and
153:59 - now we have a second pillar which is the
154:01 - forum uh which is growing really rapidly
154:04 - and we've got a lot of exciting things
154:05 - going on there that i can talk about and
154:06 - then the third pillar is the
154:09 - publication uh freecodecamp.org news
154:13 - um so you find it interesting that that
154:14 - forums
154:16 - are cool again
154:18 - they're always cool-ish i mean
154:20 - to some degree sure like i think social
154:22 - media is quintessential
154:24 - community of the internet to a certain
154:26 - degree yes but then you have social
154:28 - networks and you got groups within those
154:29 - networks so it's like you know what is
154:31 - truly a forum so you're saying in this
154:32 - case
154:33 - a literal forum yeah a self-hosted place
154:37 - where people can have threaded
154:38 - discussions right over long periods of
154:40 - time
154:41 - that's indexed by google
154:43 - that has its own search tools that has
154:45 - accounts
154:46 - uh that has moderator tools all those
154:48 - things where
154:49 - the organization who's hosting that
154:52 - forum
154:53 - has control play control yeah if you
154:55 - contrast this with like you know a
154:57 - subreddit or if you contrast this with a
154:59 - facebook group
155:00 - a forum
155:01 - gives a lot more organization a lot more
155:03 - power to the organization and also means
155:05 - that you know the data stays on that
155:07 - server with that organization it's not
155:09 - being used for
155:11 - advertising curious how you host it what
155:13 - do you do yeah we
155:15 - so we use discourse which is a really
155:17 - popular form tool yeah created by
155:19 - uh jeff atwood and his is a partner sam
155:22 - i can't remember sam's last name saffron
155:24 - sam saffron thank you and they are
155:27 - really solid developers and they also
155:30 - know a lot about online communities with
155:32 - you know stack overflow being one of the
155:33 - bigger ones so uh a lot of the same
155:36 - defaults that they bring to the table
155:38 - are what we use so yeah what about
155:40 - literal hosting though like do you host
155:42 - it yourself what do you what's your
155:44 - what's your architecture aws or
155:46 - yeah so it's it's a docker image and we
155:48 - just we have it on digitalocean okay so
155:51 - we use a lot we publish this whole
155:53 - organization like
155:55 - visualization of free code camps
155:57 - architecture
155:59 - and discourse
156:01 - supports our instance so that's like
156:03 - that 80 bucks a month i see cool
156:06 - for us to have a hosted uh digital ocean
156:08 - i was asking that because this course
156:10 - does have like a like a service version
156:12 - right yes their own host so you're not
156:14 - hosted by them you host your own but
156:15 - they said they support it they support
156:17 - well in the sense that like we
156:19 - every six months there's some huge thing
156:21 - i start messaging them on their own meta
156:23 - discourse yeah like hey yeah yeah
156:25 - exactly yeah and we have ssh access but
156:27 - if if there's something catastrophic we
156:29 - you know
156:30 - we can ask them to go click flip the
156:33 - switches right so the buck doesn't stop
156:35 - at you in terms of the you host it but
156:37 - you got help well free code camp the
156:39 - forum is one of the bigger ones uh i
156:42 - think there are probably some big like i
156:43 - know blizzard and described
156:45 - so we're getting about five million
156:48 - views a month on the forum nice
156:52 - and it's pretty big
156:54 - i assume there's a lot of recurring
156:55 - active i mean there's lots of
156:56 - conversations yeah forum hits some
156:58 - people are just googling they find a
156:59 - solution in a forum but there's a lot of
157:01 - people that are actually like actively
157:02 - part of the community posting answers
157:04 - posting questions on the daily yeah at
157:06 - any given time there might be
157:09 - 60
157:09 - 80 100 people logged in using the forum
157:13 - so let me go back and collect ecliptic
157:15 - guy let me go back and clarify the
157:17 - skepticism because it wasn't that we
157:18 - were skeptical of the concept or the
157:20 - idea of free code camp it was really
157:22 - just like the will it continued to last
157:24 - because you're a non-profit there's lots
157:26 - of startups that are also non-profits
157:28 - they're just they don't want to be
157:29 - nonprofits but they are but we talked
157:31 - about the sustainability of like you
157:33 - pouring yourself into this we didn't
157:34 - know it was pretty new at the time all
157:36 - you had was curriculum and it was like
157:38 - is this going to be a round right we're
157:40 - also putting a ton of time into and it
157:42 - seemed like a lot of work
157:44 - and anytime you see those those things
157:46 - it's just the rest before
157:47 - maybe yeah for burnout yeah exactly or
157:50 - or uh goat farming in the horizon right
157:52 - right but you're still here you're still
157:54 - standing so i guess that's maybe the
157:55 - question is not extending he's thriving
157:58 - fair enough striving what have you found
158:00 - what's working what how did you get to
158:02 - this point you know you have a probably
158:04 - a team you have lots of i know you have
158:05 - lots of people that are working on it so
158:07 - how would you figure out that way yeah
158:09 - well
158:10 - last time i was on
158:11 - youtube were both asking lots of very
158:14 - similar questions about sustainability
158:16 - because we do yeah and and you since
158:19 - you've had the whole request for commits
158:21 - uh series which is phenomenal i
158:23 - recommend everybody check it out
158:24 - and i listen to that and nadia eggball
158:27 - and michael rogers and uh
158:29 - you know that was really helpful for me
158:31 - as well just thinking about uh open
158:33 - source and sustainability yeah uh since
158:36 - i visited we finally got the 501c3
158:39 - status which is the u.s government's
158:42 - tax-exempt
158:43 - status code it's the same one that like
158:45 - doctors without borders
158:47 - and the red cross and all these big ngos
158:50 - have right so now if you donate the free
158:52 - code camp you can deduct it from your
158:53 - taxes and we ourselves don't have to pay
158:55 - taxes which is a huge
158:57 - savings absolutely yeah it makes a big
159:00 - difference so uh we were able to
159:05 - shift from just selling merchandise
159:07 - which was the only way we were
159:08 - sustaining free code camp which you know
159:10 - spoiler alert it was barely covering
159:13 - even the servers let alone you know
159:15 - payroll and other things and i i put a
159:18 - lot of my savings uh into it i put about
159:20 - 150 000
159:22 - into free code camp which keep in mind i
159:24 - was a teacher and a school director
159:26 - that's like
159:28 - i was basically saving every half of
159:30 - everything i earned for like 10 years
159:32 - yeah that was the money that i had and
159:33 - we were gonna use that to get a house
159:35 - and or a down payment on a house in
159:37 - california
159:38 - um but
159:39 - did that keep you up at night like were
159:41 - you were you were you confident you were
159:43 - gonna find that that thing that works or
159:45 - were there nights where you're like you
159:46 - know what i'm just wasting my savings
159:48 - away well so i wasn't
159:50 - i never thought it was wasted because
159:51 - people were benefiting tremendously but
159:53 - i was worried that i it was not going to
159:55 - work out and i was going to have to go
159:56 - get a job but really that's like
159:58 - that's a very nice
160:00 - first world problem to have like oh my
160:02 - gosh if this fails then you have to go
160:04 - out and get a nice job as a software
160:06 - engineer right but i mean 10 years of
160:08 - your savings gone is beyond that what
160:10 - he's saying is that that doesn't
160:11 - outweigh the risk of of loss and i i
160:15 - guess to some degree the belief in what
160:17 - you were doing enough to keep going what
160:20 - you've done
160:21 - yeah yeah it could have been nice though
160:23 - yeah that kind of risk that kind of that
160:25 - kind of
160:26 - any fear anything like where you were
160:27 - like twitching oh yeah it was a long and
160:29 - and i had my first child
160:31 - about one year in it gets deeper uh so
160:35 - you know that was and we were living in
160:36 - a
160:37 - we were living in the bay area in a
160:39 - one-bedroom apartment yeah it was like
160:41 - 700 square feet and we had a baby in
160:43 - there and i was just on my laptop all
160:46 - day long every day just crunching
160:49 - trying to reassure my wife
160:52 - that we would pull through and
160:54 - everything would be okay now she had a
160:56 - job at a tech company doing accounting
160:58 - and
160:59 - she as a result we had health insurance
161:02 - so our position was already better than
161:04 - a lot of americans and we both had lots
161:07 - of options so i just want to
161:09 - emphasize that like we were coming from
161:11 - a position of great flexibility and
161:14 - privilege yeah that a lot of people do
161:15 - not
161:16 - enjoy so i don't want to sound like at
161:18 - all
161:19 - um because really i mean worst case
161:22 - scenario i i had like standing offers
161:24 - from different companies that would have
161:25 - probably hired me and
161:27 - all those things but free cocaine was
161:29 - doing great people were using it people
161:31 - loved it and i knew that we could make
161:33 - it work where there's use there's
161:35 - usefulness
161:37 - yeah so what what financially made it
161:40 - work finally like it's working now right
161:42 - yeah yeah we're break even essentially
161:44 - so
161:46 - what we did was uh as soon as it became
161:49 - clear that we were gonna get our tax
161:50 - exempt status not that we actually got
161:52 - it quite yet but before that we'd always
161:55 - been just shifting
161:56 - if you want to support free co camp here
161:58 - donate money instead to women who code
162:00 - or donate money to hack club or donate
162:04 - money to
162:05 - hacker dojo or some of these other
162:06 - non-profits that are helping in
162:08 - developer education because
162:10 - we really wanted to make sure that
162:11 - people were able to deduct things and
162:13 - and the money was going to in to a
162:15 - proper non-profit so once we got that
162:17 - nonprofit status you know retroactively
162:19 - all all the donations to us were tax
162:21 - deductible and i remember just holding
162:24 - my newborn son
162:25 - and holding up the the certification
162:28 - that i got from the us government
162:30 - and that was kind of the light at the
162:31 - end of the tunnel and from there we just
162:35 - worked really hard to get a whole lot of
162:37 - people doing monthly recurring donations
162:39 - to us which is beneficial not only
162:41 - because
162:42 - a lot of people can afford you know five
162:44 - twenty even twenty five dollars we had a
162:46 - few people giving like 250 a month
162:48 - a lot of people can afford that and
162:50 - uh it says it's monthly it gives us the
162:54 - ability to project out and budget
162:56 - and for an organization like us like we
162:59 - just need to be able to budget we're not
163:01 - trying to make huge fixed
163:04 - cost investments yeah we're just paying
163:05 - for servers we're paying for people to
163:07 - be working on free code game full time
163:10 - so let me throw a number at you here
163:12 - this comes from your five years of free
163:14 - code camp post which is on change dog
163:16 - news also in the show notes for those
163:18 - who missed it
163:19 - more than 40 000
163:21 - free code camp graduates are now working
163:23 - in tech at companies like apple google
163:25 - microsoft amazon and spotify surely many
163:28 - other companies as well that's an
163:30 - astronomical number 40 000 those are
163:32 - people who've been certified through the
163:33 - program
163:34 - many of them have gotten certifications
163:35 - that includes
163:37 - everybody who's in our
163:38 - linkedin alumni network which is like 60
163:41 - 000-ish people
163:43 - who are working now in technical roles
163:46 - uh not everybody
163:48 - ultimately got the certification because
163:50 - if you get a job like you're a graduate
163:52 - all right let me explain the graduation
163:54 - certification it would be a ends to um
163:56 - or a means to an end once you have the
163:57 - end you're not gonna like well i really
163:59 - need my fcc certification right yeah
164:02 - a lot of people get the job and then
164:03 - they'll come back and gradually try to
164:05 - finish it what's that not that fcc
164:07 - this is yeah i mean of course not the
164:10 - federal communication just in case he
164:11 - was thinking like did they start
164:13 - what yeah when were you fcc this is
164:15 - audio and this is the airwaves the
164:16 - internet airwaves that's right yeah okay
164:19 - so but still i mean 40 000 people that
164:21 - is to me
164:23 - a huge amount i mean what does that feel
164:25 - like do you feel those numbers or they
164:27 - get so big at a certain point that it's
164:28 - kind of like another drop in the bucket
164:31 - i mean some some numbers are hard to
164:32 - actually like i don't know like reify in
164:35 - your mind well
164:37 - i'm
164:38 - you know extremely blessed and i just
164:40 - feel incredibly
164:42 - grateful that there are so many people
164:44 - out there who bother you know emailing
164:47 - me or tweeting at me or sharing these
164:49 - stories of their transitions from you
164:51 - know working in accounting
164:53 - being a trucker
164:54 - working in manufacturing uh all these
164:56 - different fields that they've gone from
164:58 - to doing software development and yeah
165:01 - so that's interesting it contextualizes
165:03 - those numbers when you're getting
165:04 - practically every day i get an email
165:06 - from somebody saying hey i just was able
165:08 - to do this you know thanks again and
165:10 - then i'm able to follow up and say like
165:12 - oh yeah can you tell me a little bit
165:14 - more about how you
165:15 - um how you made this transition or can
165:17 - you post it on the forum because a whole
165:18 - lot of people are in the process of
165:20 - trying to make this transition yeah and
165:22 - so
165:24 - the number isn't abstract i mean it's
165:25 - abstract that it's that large
165:27 - but i have so many concrete examples of
165:30 - that every day that drive home to me
165:33 - and
165:33 - so for me you know it's just it's a it's
165:36 - a dream come true i never would have
165:38 - imagined that we would have anywhere
165:40 - near
165:41 - the scale of people
165:43 - being able to uh accomplish new things
165:45 - and you know provide for their families
165:47 - in new ways and actualize themselves and
165:50 - be creative in new ways so
165:52 - yeah it's just been a huge honor and a
165:54 - huge blessing so one of the challenges
165:57 - that we've seen people facing coming out
165:59 - of non-traditional education backgrounds
166:02 - such as i have a free code camp
166:03 - certification or some sort other boot
166:06 - camp or i'm self-taught
166:08 - is that
166:09 - that hiring process is difficult for
166:11 - them uh for lots of reasons one of the
166:13 - reasons is that companies and
166:15 - organizations aren't
166:16 - always on board with hiring i mean
166:19 - more people are looking for senior
166:20 - developers than junior developers and uh
166:23 - people who going through free code camp
166:24 - sounds like they're having success
166:26 - getting hired
166:27 - do you help them on that side of things
166:30 - or is there like a community support i'm
166:32 - wondering like if there's like tips and
166:34 - tricks or how are people having that
166:35 - level of success like yeah i got through
166:37 - the program and i got a job because like
166:40 - you said the job is what most of us are
166:41 - after and so i'm just curious if there's
166:43 - like if the community helps on the job
166:45 - side or if it's just like once you're
166:47 - through the program
166:48 - you just are competent enough to get
166:50 - yourself a job yeah that's a great
166:52 - question we've kind of made a like a
166:54 - neutrality
166:55 - setup where we don't we don't
166:57 - specifically guide people to specific
166:59 - companies
167:00 - um we try we we thought about we built
167:03 - out of a job board and we were going to
167:05 - have it to where people could apply for
167:06 - jobs directly through free code camp but
167:09 - we just thought about like
167:10 - you know if somebody has a negative
167:11 - experience or
167:13 - if there are people out there who are
167:15 - you know that you read about a lot of
167:17 - these silicon valley companies that
167:19 - basically just pretend that they've got
167:21 - all this vc funding and things like that
167:23 - and then the funny never materialized
167:25 - these people have moved to this
167:26 - expensive city and and basically get
167:28 - stiffed on their on their paycheck uh
167:30 - you know we didn't want to be
167:32 - associated with any sort of like
167:35 - project like that so we just decided you
167:37 - know we're not gonna
167:38 - we're gonna leave the job
167:40 - board stuff and the recruitment stuff to
167:42 - the experts and we're just going to
167:45 - focus on training people now we do have
167:48 - interview preparation section
167:50 - uh that has
167:51 - hundreds of additional algorithm
167:53 - challenges uh we've got like we've
167:56 - updated a lot of the project euler
167:58 - problems uh rosetta code problems and
168:00 - made them interactive with like tests
168:02 - that you can run right in the browser
168:03 - instead of having to
168:04 - uh you know
168:06 - the old interface for project wheeler
168:08 - was
168:09 - it's like a 20 year old website
168:11 - but it's just like you enter a number
168:13 - and it tells you whether you're right or
168:14 - wrong it doesn't give you any more
168:15 - feedback than that and it just takes a
168:17 - long time to enter it
168:19 - so rather than having to do all that
168:21 - coding locally and then go and type a
168:23 - number into a web form and see if you're
168:25 - right uh we we just modernized it and
168:28 - made an interactive experience but so
168:30 - we've got lots of interview preparation
168:32 - stuff we've also got at this point
168:35 - probably hundreds
168:37 - of i got a job type posts on the forum
168:40 - and we've got lots of articles from
168:42 - people who transitioned successfully
168:44 - from other fields into tech who
168:46 - successfully got jobs at amazon or
168:48 - google or other places like that telling
168:51 - how
168:52 - they went through that process like
168:54 - especially the thing that people
168:56 - underestimate the most it's just the
168:57 - sheer numbers game that the modern
168:59 - job uh the modern
169:01 - developer job application process
169:04 - constitutes
169:06 - is quite often for like somebody who's
169:08 - finished free code camp or somebody
169:09 - who's gone to a boot camp to have to
169:11 - apply to hundreds of jobs and
169:14 - then they'll start to get uh interviews
169:16 - and then they'll start to get offers but
169:18 - we just try to
169:20 - instill in people the notion that this
169:22 - is hard
169:23 - this is not easy anybody who tells you
169:25 - it's easy to go out and get a developer
169:27 - job
169:28 - they're probably trying to sell you
169:29 - something because it's not easy that's
169:31 - right
169:33 - so
169:34 - we have all these resources and we have
169:36 - a supportive community who's there to
169:38 - share in your accomplishments and you
169:40 - can just read lots of anecdotes that
169:42 - realize the statistics that we all know
169:44 - that there are a tremendous number of
169:46 - developer jobs at all different levels
169:48 - uh certainly there are a lot of middle
169:51 - tier and senior jobs and the senior ones
169:54 - are the ones where the recruiters most
169:55 - actively go out and aggressively try to
169:57 - recruit people but there are definitely
170:00 - tons of small medium level businesses
170:02 - that just need somebody you know the
170:04 - church or the
170:06 - um local
170:08 - food bank or the other
170:10 - organizations that want to have a nice
170:11 - website or
170:13 - just need somebody to help set up like a
170:15 - facebook group or configure like a wix
170:18 - website or something like that from your
170:20 - vantage point can you see trends there
170:22 - in terms of it getting
170:24 - by no means is it easy but are we
170:27 - is it trending up in terms of those
170:29 - entry level opportunities in your
170:30 - opinion or is it just kind of been like
170:32 - a steady churn
170:33 - obviously this would be
170:35 - from your vantage point not like it's
170:36 - like based on numbers but
170:38 - so
170:40 - i could look at the numbers and we do
170:42 - have quite a bit of data that we've made
170:43 - public we
170:45 - for the last three years we didn't do it
170:47 - this year just because we've already
170:49 - done it so many times and there was
170:50 - already so much data it's a lot of work
170:52 - uh we we did what's called the new coder
170:54 - survey and it shows like how many you
170:57 - know it asks about 50 questions we had
170:59 - like 30 000 respondents this is really
171:01 - nice huge data set yeah
171:03 - significant
171:05 - from a statistical standpoint
171:07 - um and if you dig into that you can see
171:09 - like how many months of experience
171:11 - people had before they you know started
171:14 - applying for jobs or how long they've
171:15 - been working in for jobs and you can you
171:17 - can sort of play with the numbers and
171:18 - figure that out i don't have like a
171:20 - really well informed answer on that
171:22 - a lot of what i hear is just at the
171:24 - street level people like saying that
171:26 - they got a job or people saying they
171:27 - haven't gotten a job yet
171:29 - um
171:30 - it's in reality is messy and every
171:32 - employer is different every country is
171:34 - different too they you know european
171:36 - uh and i say european that's really like
171:38 - a collection of
171:40 - city states right
171:41 - um and then you know you go to india you
171:44 - go to china you go to all these other
171:45 - countries where free cooking is really
171:46 - big and
171:47 - and the market's completely different
171:49 - i've been to startups in like shanghai
171:52 - uh where i walk in the room and half the
171:54 - people working in the developer bullpen
171:57 - are free cocaine grads wow right so so
171:59 - there are definitely jobs
172:01 - out there uh for people it's just a
172:04 - question of
172:05 - what those jobs look like and how many
172:07 - applications you have to make and how
172:09 - many people are competing for those same
172:10 - jobs
172:12 - i will say this though getting a job i
172:15 - think a lot of people think it's all
172:16 - about your skills but it's really about
172:17 - three things in my opinion it's about
172:19 - your skills
172:20 - it's about your reputation
172:23 - and
172:24 - it's about your network
172:25 - whom you know
172:28 - if you know the right people you can get
172:30 - in
172:31 - even with subpar skills subpar
172:33 - reputation if you have a great
172:35 - reputation you may not be the best
172:36 - developer but people know who you are
172:38 - from your blog posts or from your
172:40 - youtube channel for your podcast or or
172:42 - just from your open source projects that
172:43 - you've contributed to everyone wants to
172:46 - de-risk a choice right and the rate the
172:48 - risk of choice is by
172:49 - some sort of assurance or certainty
172:52 - right so if you have a decent reputation
172:55 - you can kind of bet that you're a decent
172:57 - person yeah
172:59 - de-risking is exactly what i think
173:01 - employers are trying to do they're sure
173:02 - they're just trying not to make the
173:03 - catastrophic choice that results in them
173:05 - having to
173:07 - terminate somebody yeah pay a whole
173:09 - bunch of severance and then go through
173:11 - the entire job
173:12 - all over again yeah and it's it's costly
173:15 - it's funny
173:16 - that uh who you know comes so
173:19 - it makes sense but we try to be in a
173:20 - world where
173:21 - it's not about
173:23 - who you know because it's it almost
173:24 - seems unfair
173:26 - and yet it totally still is the facts
173:28 - right right that's what i mean like so
173:30 - if you don't know the right kind of
173:31 - people you can't build your reputation
173:33 - properly or at least maybe add to an
173:35 - area where you have less reputation you
173:37 - have somebody vouching for you for like
173:38 - a better term if you have a network
173:40 - it's a network of people
173:43 - to some degree associating with you
173:45 - they're they're fine they're therefore
173:47 - kind of adding to your reputation that
173:49 - you're trustworthy that you're right
173:50 - somebody worth betting on or taking a
173:52 - risk on yeah and this is why like the
173:54 - local markets are so important yeah
173:56 - people focus so much on silicon valley
173:58 - and like the hyper competitive like
173:59 - trying to get a job
174:01 - offer from google or facebook or amazon
174:03 - but
174:05 - if you go to a lot of communities like
174:07 - we're here in houston
174:08 - right and i live in i live in the dallas
174:10 - metropolitan area
174:12 - and jared lives up in omaha like these
174:14 - are all completely different tech
174:15 - ecosystems with different employers
174:17 - different hiring cultures um different
174:21 - circles of people that meet together for
174:23 - tech talks and and events and
174:26 - different professional groups i mean
174:28 - like if you learn your local meta and if
174:30 - you're content to stay in the city
174:32 - you're you are in currently
174:35 - um
174:36 - there won't necessarily be like a clear
174:38 - road map for you to get to that job but
174:40 - if you pound the pavement and if you get
174:42 - to meet people i think that things will
174:44 - work out for you because you're already
174:45 - doing a lot more work than most job
174:47 - applicants plus like you said uh
174:50 - many companies that aren't traditional
174:51 - software companies need software people
174:54 - and so as you know the old saying go
174:56 - software see in the world every company
174:57 - is becoming a software company well
174:59 - there's a lot more competition to work
175:00 - at the software company right they need
175:02 - developers because they develop software
175:04 - for a living but a lot of companies that
175:07 - just need like one or two people
175:09 - and maybe their bar is a little bit
175:11 - lower the competition is going to be
175:12 - less maybe you have a friend who works
175:14 - there like there's just lots of those
175:16 - would you might consider non-traditional
175:18 - software opportunities where it's like
175:20 - well maybe they're not a software
175:21 - company but they have software needs and
175:23 - i bet you can pitch in there maybe even
175:25 - more so than you could at the place that
175:27 - has 100 developers already yeah
175:30 - if uh if getting a developer job is
175:33 - hard
175:34 - does that mean that it's got something
175:36 - broken in the system
175:38 - and if if you say yes what is that and
175:41 - if no then move on
175:44 - so if it's hard to get a job that way
175:45 - what's
175:46 - it's somewhat of an indicator that
175:48 - there's a broken system yeah i mean
175:49 - there's broken processes something's
175:51 - broken what makes it so difficult aside
175:54 - from
175:55 - reputation network skill it's it's hard
175:58 - here in the us
176:00 - again and i have lots of friends in
176:02 - china and in india and places like that
176:04 - where i think it's comparatively easy
176:06 - not in every city in those countries but
176:08 - in a lot of markets it's just much
176:10 - easier to go out and get a job uh in the
176:13 - us we have like a combination of like
176:16 - benefits and like
176:18 - the legal framework and all these things
176:19 - make hiring and firing very difficult so
176:22 - because it's it's difficult to bring
176:25 - some it's costly to make a mistake yeah
176:28 - really so that makes employers really
176:29 - risk-averse even in a field where
176:32 - there's so much demand and also
176:34 - employers to some extent are operating
176:36 - under pattern recognition so they're
176:37 - like oh this person has worked at this
176:39 - company right that's like the biggest
176:41 - indicator of your likelihood of success
176:42 - who have you worked for and are do they
176:45 - have similarly stringent uh hiring
176:48 - requirements uh so if you've worked at
176:50 - google there's a very good chance that
176:51 - you're going to be a good employee at
176:53 - you know xyz corp as well so um
176:57 - i and these are things that i think
176:59 - there's a great
177:01 - she writes a lot of articles for
177:03 - pre-cocaine's publication as well uh
177:06 - alien lerner
177:07 - she does interviewing.io
177:09 - and she's written a ton of articles that
177:11 - are much more data driven on this but i
177:13 - i wouldn't say hiring is broken
177:16 - that's kind of a strong word but i would
177:17 - say there are very clear ways in which
177:20 - things can be improved without having to
177:22 - completely overhaul
177:23 - you know the way that we handle labor in
177:25 - the united states for example uh just
177:28 - pair programming or doing more take home
177:29 - assignments rather than doing whiteboard
177:31 - uh challenges would be one i think
177:33 - fairly obvious improvement because that
177:35 - is heavily biased toward recent college
177:37 - graduates who just spent a whole bunch
177:38 - of time
177:39 - but basically going ad nauseam through
177:42 - uh algorithms for like tests and stuff
177:44 - like that
177:45 - it doesn't work as well when you're
177:46 - hiring somebody who's
177:48 - who's been out of the job market for a
177:49 - while if they just had a kid
177:51 - or somebody who has just been working
177:53 - for a long time but hasn't
177:54 - interviewed for jobs recently
177:56 - your mission isn't to
177:59 - get people hired it's to educate
178:03 - would you say that would you agree with
178:04 - that or is it kind of
178:06 - part of both sides so
178:07 - you know you don't really help place so
178:09 - you're not
178:10 - it's sort of part of it's it's implied
178:12 - by your efforts so our official mission
178:15 - is just to help as many people as
178:16 - possible learn to code
178:18 - i think it's written at the bottom of
178:20 - every single page in our footer that's
178:22 - our official ngo's mission yeah that
178:24 - said
178:25 - virtually everybody who uses
178:27 - freecodecamp dreams of one day becoming
178:30 - more technical now whether that's
178:31 - actually being a software engineer yeah
178:34 - or
178:36 - just you know being a designer who can
178:38 - code or a marketer who can code
178:41 - or
178:42 - somebody who wants to build like a cool
178:44 - interface for their drone that they're
178:46 - flying around as a hobby yeah somebody
178:48 - who wants to build an alexa app just to
178:50 - impress their kids
178:51 - you know there are so many different
178:54 - use cases for
178:56 - programming knowledge but it's all a net
178:59 - positive i like to say that
179:01 - you know
179:02 - back in the
179:03 - 1600s
179:05 - you didn't need to be able to read to go
179:07 - out and work right but the people who
179:10 - did sit down and take the time to learn
179:12 - to read were infinitely
179:14 - not infinitely but they were
179:15 - dramatically better off as a result same
179:17 - thing in the 1920s if you learned how to
179:19 - drive a car suddenly you had all these
179:21 - new opportunities open to you and
179:23 - more recently like the 1990s people
179:25 - really learn how to use spreadsheets
179:28 - they learned how to use word processors
179:31 - they learned how to use like these slide
179:33 - based tools like powerpoint and that
179:35 - opened up so many opportunities for
179:37 - people so yeah you can get by without it
179:39 - you could be
179:41 - you know a congress person
179:43 - a congress person in 2019 who doesn't
179:45 - know how to type and just relies on the
179:46 - secretary to do the typing for them
179:48 - right but
179:50 - real life like you're better off
179:53 - just gathering those additional skills
179:55 - and i think that
179:57 - soon people will awaken to the fact that
180:00 - being able to code is very helpful and
180:02 - it does give you a whole lot of
180:03 - additional options
180:05 - so figuring out the financials is one
180:06 - aspect of sustainability another aspect
180:09 - is making it so that quincy doesn't have
180:11 - to do all the work
180:13 - and surely you have a team at this point
180:15 - and lots of people contributing so like
180:17 - to hear the different roles who's
180:18 - involved in the and then as a follow-up
180:20 - to that
180:21 - how you inspired them to get involved in
180:23 - free code transmission absolutely yeah
180:25 - so freecodecamp currently we have a lot
180:28 - of active contributors
180:30 - um
180:31 - and i'm extremely grateful for all of
180:33 - them and we're getting ready to
180:35 - maybe by the time this
180:37 - episode goes live we'll have our
180:39 - uh top contributors for 2019 we've got
180:42 - some really nice backpacks that we're
180:44 - going to ship to them
180:46 - to recognize their efforts to say 2019
180:48 - top contributor it's got the free code
180:50 - camp logo and and these are the same
180:52 - backpacks that we sold a few months ago
180:54 - we're actually
180:55 - running a second run of those two since
180:57 - we're going to be printing some
180:58 - these top controller ones but
181:01 - there are seven people who work for free
181:03 - code camp full time including myself and
181:06 - they are all generalists
181:09 - in the sense that they all wear a lot of
181:12 - hats
181:13 - everybody
181:14 - comes up through free code camp as
181:16 - contributors after a few years of
181:17 - contributing
181:19 - if they
181:20 - seem to be particularly capable
181:23 - or
181:23 - particularly
181:26 - passionate then
181:28 - and we have the resources
181:30 - then we will bring them on and so
181:32 - currently the team is is again me doing
181:36 - just
181:37 - everything like i do support and i also
181:39 - do
181:40 - uh
181:41 - i'm overseeing a couple different
181:42 - projects within
181:44 - then we have beau carnes who is running
181:47 - the frico camp youtube channel which
181:49 - recently became i think the biggest
181:51 - programming channel on youtube it's got
181:53 - 1.4 million subscribers now
181:56 - there's a channel called the new boston
181:57 - that hasn't been updated like four or
181:59 - five years and they have more
182:00 - subscribers than we do but other than
182:03 - them i think we're the biggest
182:04 - uh so beau runs that he creates a lot of
182:07 - the videos he does a lot of the editing
182:09 - for our contributors and
182:12 - uh beau also is working with a
182:14 - curriculum so beau worked as a teacher
182:16 - for
182:17 - i think five or six years prior to
182:19 - joining free code camp a public school
182:21 - teacher up in michigan
182:24 - we have abby
182:25 - abigail renomeier she is based in
182:28 - portland and she
182:30 - worked as a
182:32 - archaeologist
182:35 - before
182:36 - she has like a
182:38 - totally different background
182:40 - but she had been
182:42 - editing
182:43 - thousands of articles for the free code
182:45 - camp publication
182:46 - and
182:47 - she kept doing it and i was like hey you
182:49 - want to do this full-time so she's been
182:51 - doing that she also runs the podcast so
182:54 - if you've listened to the free co-cam
182:55 - podcast there's a good chance you've
182:56 - heard her interviewing people
182:58 - and
183:00 - then we have ahmed
183:02 - abdul sahab
183:04 - he's in turkey
183:05 - i recently immigrated to turkey
183:08 - and he is doing some exciting things
183:11 - over there uh
183:13 - he does a lot of the design like when we
183:16 - overhauled freco camp's visual design uh
183:19 - he did a lot of that work and he also
183:21 - does a lot of
183:23 - just like the day the in and out
183:25 - code maintenance
183:27 - um then we have murgesh mahapatra who is
183:31 - in bengaluru or bangalore
183:33 - and he
183:35 - does pretty much everything regarding
183:37 - the core code base and like all the
183:39 - servers and
183:40 - he uh he's the person we call if
183:43 - something catastrophic happens
183:46 - and then
183:47 - we have uh christopher koishigawa who's
183:51 - in south korea
183:53 - and he was working as a
183:55 - teacher for the last six years and
183:57 - started contributing a whole lot to our
184:00 - to our interview prep section and so we
184:03 - brought him on so he and bo are working
184:04 - together on the updated curriculum which
184:06 - i can talk about in a minute and then we
184:08 - also have uh mia lu
184:11 - who is based in hangzhou
184:14 - in china and she's running the free code
184:17 - camp china team and we basically have
184:19 - like a completely parallel organization
184:21 - in china and we've got chinese language
184:24 - forum chinese language publication and
184:26 - chinese language curriculum
184:28 - and that's you know hundreds of
184:30 - thousands of people using that
184:32 - so
184:33 - i think i got everybody
184:36 - it is hard to always remember everybody
184:38 - on the spot yeah
184:40 - as we experienced recently as well so
184:43 - that's amazing you have a parallel
184:44 - organization in china just curious in
184:46 - terms of the free code camp alum or even
184:49 - just the users
184:50 - i mean your team is spread abroad and so
184:54 - is where's your biggest audience like do
184:56 - you have the foothold in india is it
184:58 - india india and the united states are
185:00 - like neck and neck sometimes india gets
185:02 - there are more people in india sometimes
185:03 - there are more people in the us
185:05 - uh and then nigeria's third
185:07 - and china
185:09 - um and then is that based on just visits
185:11 - or how do you how do you
185:13 - use
185:14 - logged in use yeah like time on site
185:16 - yeah right so you have chinese
185:18 - translation do you have
185:20 - translation into other languages as well
185:21 - or just
185:23 - yeah it was a great question what we're
185:24 - trying to do is just really make sure
185:25 - that we have everything rock solid in
185:27 - chinese and chinese
185:29 - is
185:30 - bigger than most of the other world
185:32 - languages combined
185:33 - uh it's second only the english if you
185:35 - look at wikipedia usage and this is what
185:37 - we used for our metrics i like to to
185:39 - plan internationalization we looked at
185:42 - how wikipedia was being used and
185:44 - and we looked at like the world language
185:46 - usage for different uh translations of
185:49 - wikipedia
185:50 - um and then we looked at like the total
185:52 - number of speakers of those languages
185:53 - that were using the internet actively
185:56 - um
185:56 - china is just exploding in terms of
185:59 - people
186:00 - adopting technology and they're very
186:03 - enthusiastic about it
186:06 - and
186:07 - a lot of them are getting great jobs and
186:08 - there's a lot of money going into
186:11 - just a lot of different aspects of like
186:13 - um artificial intelligence like machine
186:16 - learning essentially yeah um
186:19 - the real machine learning and also the
186:20 - ifs
186:21 - and then statements and stuff like that
186:23 - um and then also
186:25 - there is a whole lot of um
186:28 - expertise in china uh india a lot of the
186:32 - great indian engineers stay here and a
186:34 - lot of the chinese engineers go back to
186:36 - china and create companies so
186:38 - uh
186:39 - you know
186:40 - i'm trying to think of some uh
186:42 - some names of famous engineers who've
186:45 - left like google or have left like
186:47 - teaching at stanford uh who've gone back
186:49 - to china but there are a lot of really
186:52 - promising companies over there
186:54 - so
186:55 - we wanted to do china first
186:57 - um i personally maybe i'm a little bit
186:59 - biased because i lived in china for like
187:01 - five years my wife's chinese and i'm
187:04 - just very optimistic about the future of
187:05 - china they've
187:07 - over the course of the past 30 years
187:09 - they've taken
187:11 - hundreds of millions of people from
187:13 - subsistence art agriculture
187:16 - and they've transformed into a
187:17 - manufacturing center in the world and
187:19 - now they're transforming into much more
187:21 - services and creative based economy
187:25 - and
187:26 - learning the code is going to be a big
187:27 - part of that for sure can you speak to
187:29 - the the need for
187:31 - native language curriculum like
187:34 - specifically with what i've heard at
187:35 - least with china is that
187:37 - there's
187:38 - you know this desire obviously a massive
187:40 - amount of people there but most of the
187:43 - documentation
187:45 - a lot of the books tend to be
187:48 - are more likely to be in english can you
187:50 - speak to the the need for native
187:51 - language curriculum yeah well it's
187:53 - always easiest to learn in your native
187:55 - language just one less thing you need to
187:56 - worry about
187:58 - uh a lot of people more than a billion
188:00 - have
188:01 - chinese is there
188:03 - they're mainly more than a billion yeah
188:05 - yeah i mean if you include if you
188:07 - include like written chinese like there
188:08 - are a lot of right spoken dialects
188:11 - on earth six point five seven billion
188:13 - people yeah you're behind
188:15 - it's like seven and a half or eight yeah
188:17 - yeah it'll be eight and like ten or
188:18 - fifteen
188:20 - stats machine here okay but the point is
188:22 - is that that's quite a lot of people i
188:23 - mean more than a billion people yeah
188:25 - that's a massive amount of people that's
188:27 - like
188:28 - i'm gonna say one half facebook but i
188:30 - can't remember facebook facebook i think
188:31 - is 2.5 billion
188:34 - gosh that's crazy
188:36 - yeah it would make sense too it's
188:38 - interesting too to hear your insights on
188:39 - the choice
188:41 - to use a massive um
188:44 - global site like wikipedia as an example
188:48 - to say a smart you know why did you
188:51 - choose where did you choose first under
188:53 - what circumstances
188:54 - because in a lot of ways what you're
188:56 - doing is creating a wikipedia for like a
188:57 - better terms for software developers
188:59 - right curriculum is very much like that
189:01 - wikipedia has been a huge influence on
189:03 - us and of course wikipedia is mostly
189:05 - open source as well and they're also a
189:07 - non-profit so right
189:09 - in many ways if wikipedia hadn't proved
189:11 - out the concept that you could have a
189:12 - donor-supported commons
189:14 - of
189:15 - learning material in their case more
189:17 - encyclopedic in our case more procedural
189:20 - skill focused
189:21 - uh learning
189:23 - you know free co camp probably we
189:25 - wouldn't have attempted it because we
189:27 - needed that proof of concept i'm not the
189:29 - kind of person who's going to throw
189:30 - their entire livelihood
189:32 - behind like a totally wild guess but
189:36 - i sensed
189:37 - i guess correctly in retrospect that
189:38 - there would be demand there and that
189:40 - people would be people who were
189:42 - graduating from free code camp and going
189:43 - out and getting these great jobs would
189:44 - turn around and donate back to the
189:46 - organization and it would be sustainable
189:48 - do you see somebody
189:50 - utilizing free code camp and maybe a
189:52 - boot camp as well or some sort of
189:54 - intensive is there is there a scenario
189:56 - where it's only free code camp i know
189:58 - you're not trying to do that because
189:59 - you're very community minded and
190:01 - oriented but is the
190:03 - is the intention to be free co-camp
190:05 - alone or is it sort of like a companion
190:07 - to other learning opportunities so i've
190:09 - always viewed pre-co camp as a core
190:11 - curriculum if you will and a lot of
190:13 - coding bootcamps do use free codecamp as
190:15 - either part of their curriculum or
190:16 - they'll use it as their pre-course work
190:17 - and we have a really good relationship
190:19 - with a lot of coding bootcamps and i'm
190:21 - very excited about the future of coding
190:22 - bootcamps really anything that can drive
190:25 - down the cost of adult education
190:28 - the hardest part about that too is is
190:30 - curriculum development yeah right like
190:32 - if you have to start from scratch every
190:34 - time you want to start up another boot
190:35 - camp opportunity in your neck of the
190:37 - woods whether it's here in the states or
190:39 - elsewhere abroad
190:41 - you know if you can shrink that time
190:42 - from
190:43 - you know desire to teach to teaching
190:46 - it's a it's a leg up on on opportunity
190:49 - yeah i'd agree it's the hardest part but
190:51 - it's not the most important part the
190:52 - most important part is the interpersonal
190:54 - relationships that you know a teacher
190:57 - professor has with their students and
190:59 - that students have with one another
191:01 - and uh you know the counselors that help
191:04 - you prepare for the job search and all
191:06 - the other things that a university or a
191:08 - coding boot camp or um any sort of adult
191:11 - education program can add like the value
191:13 - added the curriculum itself
191:15 - really if you think about it
191:17 - very few people actually design
191:18 - curriculum in the sense that most
191:20 - universities have textbooks yeah right
191:23 - and like everybody like you go to econ
191:25 - 101 and everybody has you know the same
191:28 - textbook regardless which university
191:29 - you're studying at uh for the most part
191:31 - so yeah free code camp can be a free
191:35 - interactive
191:36 - textbook that these organizations can
191:38 - use and of course it can be used on its
191:40 - own just like i could go to a library
191:42 - and crack open a textbook and learn
191:44 - economics or i can learn you know how to
191:47 - program and see just from a textbook or
191:49 - from some sort of
191:51 - static resource the the main advantage
191:52 - with freecodecamp of course is it's
191:55 - experiential it's project focused
191:58 - and things stick a lot better when
191:59 - you're actually building how do you keep
192:01 - it fresh how do you keep it relevant
192:03 - current
192:04 - and maybe the naysayers saying oh your
192:07 - curriculum is not current enough or it
192:09 - doesn't is not idiomatic enough yeah
192:12 - how do you how do you push back the
192:13 - haters basically well we just focus on
192:15 - fundamentals uh we're not going to be
192:17 - covering bleeding edge
192:19 - tools for the most part like
192:21 - i believe that everybody needs to just
192:23 - get a really strong foundation first and
192:25 - most of what constitutes foundational
192:28 - knowledge as a developer stuff that was
192:30 - figured out in like the 60s and 70s and
192:32 - in the case of mathematics
192:34 - sometimes hundreds of years ago
192:36 - thousands of years ago right so what
192:38 - we're teaching is just the most
192:39 - ubiquitous tools that are the most
192:41 - generally applicable i think node.js is
192:44 - to a large extent one kind of the web
192:46 - server
192:46 - war if you will uh and
192:50 - uh javascript is useful for pretty much
192:52 - any kind of web development uh we're
192:54 - getting ready to introduce python as
192:56 - well as a core part of the curriculum so
192:58 - currently it's six certifications each
193:00 - certification
193:02 - requires you to build five projects and
193:04 - get all their test passing so we're
193:05 - adding four additional python focused
193:08 - certifications uh so right now our
193:10 - certification just for people who aren't
193:12 - aware
193:13 - front end
193:15 - specific we have the responsive web
193:17 - responsive web design
193:19 - we have
193:20 - javascript algorithms and data
193:22 - structures then we have
193:25 - front-end libraries data visualization
193:27 - with like d3js primarily and then we
193:30 - have the the full stack focus ones which
193:32 - are apis and microservices and
193:34 - information security and quality
193:36 - assurance so we're going to add four
193:38 - additional python ones that will be
193:40 - either at the end of that or we'll be
193:42 - we'll kind of break up those but we're
193:43 - adding
193:44 - uh
193:46 - we're adding scientific computing with
193:47 - python
193:49 - we're adding
193:51 - data analysis
193:53 - uh we're adding information security
193:54 - with python and we are adding
193:57 - machine learning using tensorflow keras
194:00 - and potentially scikit-learn
194:03 - so we're adding lots of tools but these
194:05 - are not tools that are like
194:07 - groundbreakingly new these are things
194:08 - that academics and practitioners in the
194:11 - field have been using for years
194:15 - what about things like
194:17 - the small things like
194:19 - i think of the javascript syntax and the
194:21 - updates to the language i mean the nice
194:22 - thing about web development is mostly
194:24 - additive
194:25 - like new technologies add on top of html
194:27 - and on top of css with trends in
194:30 - javascript i think the the big change
194:31 - between callbacks to promises to async
194:34 - away like those are things that do get
194:36 - outdated do you just like churn it out
194:38 - and keep it updated or do you not fight
194:40 - those battles what do you do there so we
194:42 - we just update uh like if if one thing
194:45 - like for example css variables
194:47 - we're probably going to rip out our sas
194:49 - section at this point because css is
194:51 - getting so many of the core features
194:52 - that like those pre-processors yeah and
194:54 - they're taking sass out yeah it's about
194:56 - time
194:58 - i told you nobody want in this show
195:00 - never mind
195:01 - yeah and then like like we still have a
195:03 - bootstrap section but probably just
195:05 - going to teach flexbox and grid and
195:08 - stuff like that so so we do go through
195:10 - an update and like like you just asked
195:11 - specifically as new features are added
195:14 - to es6 or es2019 or whatever they're
195:16 - calling it this year right um
195:19 - we'll just go and update the individual
195:21 - lessons and we kind of update them in
195:24 - situ and add additional
195:26 - lessons if necessary
195:28 - the entire curriculum is about to become
195:31 - completely project oriented this is
195:32 - something we started at the beginning of
195:34 - the year we're rewriting our lessons to
195:36 - all be
195:37 - building projects so instead of
195:39 - learn javascript and here are 200
195:42 - javascript lessons that are tangentially
195:44 - related
195:45 - go through them
195:47 - it's learn javascript by building a
195:49 - role-playing game yeah nice and so
195:51 - you'll build like a role-playing game
195:53 - you learn basic javascript from that
195:54 - you'll learn typography from building a
195:56 - usda nutrition label you know you'll
195:58 - you'll learn all these different things
196:00 - through projects and currently the
196:02 - curriculum is like
196:04 - 30 certification projects and a whole
196:05 - bunch of lessons soon it'll be 30
196:08 - certification projects and
196:10 - also a whole bunch of practice projects
196:12 - like 30 or 40 practice projects so those
196:15 - will all be interactive with tests the
196:17 - entire time and you'll build the
196:19 - projects one line at a time one passing
196:21 - test at a time it's so much easier to
196:23 - learn
196:24 - when you have
196:26 - some sort of like
196:27 - concrete expectation or visual
196:30 - in mind you know like giving somebody a
196:33 - goal
196:34 - and not just abstract thoughts of like
196:35 - oh here's you know as you said 200
196:38 - different
196:39 - tangential lessons on javascript it's
196:41 - more like
196:42 - here's what we're learning in order to
196:44 - build something like this that you've
196:45 - seen in the real world you may have even
196:47 - used in the real world
196:48 - you know nutrition labels for example
196:50 - what was that one for those tables uh
196:52 - learning typography typography yeah yeah
196:55 - like visual hierarchy yeah that makes
196:56 - sense yeah so we've got
196:59 - i mean this is all of course open source
197:01 - it's only github so if you want to see
197:03 - exactly how our curriculum is coming
197:04 - along you can check it out
197:06 - um
197:06 - and we're gonna keep plugging away at it
197:09 - like i said chris christopher koei
197:11 - shigawa and beau carnes are working on
197:13 - this basically full time doing
197:14 - instructional design they're both
197:16 - trained classroom teachers who've also
197:18 - learned uh web development on their own
197:21 - through frico camp over the years and
197:22 - through other resources so
197:25 - should be really really solid and even
197:28 - if it's not totally solid when it
197:29 - launches that's the great thing about
197:31 - open source it'll
197:33 - gradually
197:34 - accrue a whole bunch of improvements and
197:37 - eventually it will be great
197:41 - eventually great it's like eventual
197:42 - consistency exactly greatness
197:46 - so in addition to the refresh of the
197:47 - curriculum you also launched a brand new
197:49 - refresh to the learning platform you're
197:52 - now buzzword compliant because you're on
197:53 - the jam stack yeah you want to talk
197:55 - about some of the new infra and the code
197:57 - and what you're doing there yeah
197:58 - absolutely so
197:59 - jam stack javascript
198:01 - apis and markup is what jam stacks
198:04 - stands for
198:05 - my friend
198:07 - matt billman over at netlify
198:10 - coined that term in a bar at some point
198:12 - i don't remember the exact story but um
198:14 - he uh
198:16 - he's been a big proponent of just like
198:18 - the security and the performance boost
198:20 - that you can get from just you know
198:23 - doing everything at build time and then
198:25 - just serving like the static files
198:27 - essentially right so now free coke if
198:29 - you go to freecodegame.org and you go
198:30 - into learn app
198:32 - uh pretty much everything is
198:34 - pre-packaged and you get the entire
198:37 - application
198:38 - uh it just loads and it'll work offline
198:41 - it won't work offline perfectly right
198:42 - now but we're working on getting it to
198:44 - be like a offline first app
198:48 - so there are a lot of advantages and a
198:50 - lot of those advantages
198:51 - have to do with the fact that
198:54 - we don't have to sorry that little thing
198:56 - threw me off
198:57 - text message okay
198:59 - yeah uh
199:00 - a lot of those advantages just have to
199:02 - do with the fact that we don't spend as
199:04 - much money on servers yeah we can cache
199:06 - everything has that been like a
199:07 - substantial difference for spending like
199:10 - i mean
199:10 - it's been like 5 000 bucks a month on
199:12 - servers what are you spending now that
199:13 - you're on jam
199:15 - i think we're spending like
199:16 - 4 000 but we're still doing a lot of the
199:18 - optimizations
199:20 - gradually it'll reduce yeah wow
199:23 - yeah eventual greatness eventual
199:25 - greatness curious why
199:28 - you know if you have such a
199:30 - massive global audience why
199:33 - and this is just the
199:35 - the uh
199:37 - partnership personality in me comes out
199:39 - as like why you wouldn't reach out to
199:41 - someone in that business to
199:43 - establish some sort of partnership and
199:44 - make that zero or very low
199:47 - if anybody is listening who's like in a
199:50 - position to grant a whole lot of credits
199:52 - yeah or uh do something we'll take them
199:54 - yeah we'll take them we use all that we
199:56 - can get from like amazon
199:57 - azure
199:59 - google cloud like we use all the credits
200:01 - we can get we we just need a lot are you
200:04 - uh
200:05 - picky on platform are you picky as long
200:07 - as it's reliable so okay azure is where
200:10 - a lot of our stuff is hosted digital
200:11 - oceans where some of us hosted we we
200:14 - have to be very mindful about what
200:15 - services we we look at where like how
200:18 - critical they are so far
200:20 - azure in my experience has been
200:21 - incredibly reliable
200:23 - and aws is really reliable too
200:25 - um but we decided to like locate most of
200:28 - our database and our servers in azure
200:30 - because they gave the most generous
200:31 - credits candidly they give they give
200:33 - every non-profit like 3 500 4 000 a year
200:36 - in credits and that that's a big big
200:38 - head start and so we locate everything
200:41 - in the same data center it reduces
200:42 - latency
200:44 - so if we had like a significant offer
200:47 - of credits we might be able to relocate
200:49 - the entire
200:50 - stack for like learn over to a different
200:54 - place but we'd want to we wouldn't want
200:55 - to do a piecemeal just because the
200:56 - introduction of latency and additional
200:58 - security
200:59 - risks and stuff like that but either way
201:01 - with the new stack you've definitely
201:03 - been able to shrink said budget so yeah
201:06 - and this is just day one like this is
201:08 - the very beginning is there a stack
201:09 - though i mean isn't that the point of
201:10 - jam stack as you do it when you build
201:12 - and then well you said most of your
201:14 - stack is we still have like servers that
201:16 - like are these like things that are like
201:17 - apis yeah yeah so whenever you complete
201:20 - it whenever you complete jam a lesson
201:22 - for example that writes back and if it
201:24 - can't establish connection with server
201:26 - just stores in like local memory or i
201:28 - think local storage is what we use and
201:30 - then when it re-establishes connection
201:32 - then it pushes so we're building out all
201:34 - that kind of uh you know
201:36 - redundancy and and targetedness
201:38 - right
201:40 - very cool so any drawbacks on the jam
201:42 - stacks so far like things that you're
201:43 - like oh we didn't see this one coming
201:45 - caching validation is always challenging
201:47 - like you you push a bunch of changes and
201:49 - they're cached on cloudflare or netlify
201:52 - cdn or something and you just have to
201:53 - wait till it propagates or hey try
201:56 - refreshing and we're working on figuring
201:57 - out a way to do that so we don't have to
201:59 - tell people try doing a hard refresh
202:02 - you know
202:02 - web developers least favorite phrase yes
202:04 - try refreshing because we hate saying
202:06 - that because like it's like it means
202:07 - turn it off and on again right it's kind
202:09 - of like the yeah i kind of failed at the
202:11 - cash invalidation part
202:12 - hard refresh you have to teach people
202:14 - how to hard refresh versus regular
202:16 - refresh yeah i've been there yeah i've
202:17 - done
202:18 - that so that's that's been the biggest
202:20 - drawback but i mean a whole and then
202:22 - like like i think netlify was like under
202:25 - like a ddos attack the other day and
202:27 - like we we had some
202:28 - some uh
202:29 - like uptime issues with that but again
202:32 - it's like they're doing the best they
202:34 - can they're a pretty small organization
202:36 - compared to like the awss of the world
202:39 - um
202:40 - we just want to be there to support them
202:41 - and uh we're just grateful that like you
202:43 - know netlify discourse a whole lot of
202:45 - other organizations have given us
202:47 - in-kind
202:48 - uh sponsorship in a sense they're not
202:50 - giving us money but they are giving us
202:52 - like servers and services that makes a
202:54 - big difference yeah
202:57 - so the third pillar of what you're up to
203:00 - we've talked about the learning platform
203:02 - the forums we touched on at the very
203:03 - beginning of the conversation we haven't
203:04 - talked much about
203:06 - the publication yeah yeah that's a big
203:08 - part of free code camp is we have
203:10 - freecodecamp.org news
203:13 - and we have hundreds of authors who are
203:15 - publishing articles there
203:16 - every week not not like active we don't
203:19 - get hundreds of articles every week
203:20 - we're going for quality over quantity
203:22 - it's not an open publishing platform
203:24 - where you can just like sign in and
203:26 - start publishing
203:27 - with uh
203:29 - with the publication you have to apply
203:31 - and we're really selective i think like
203:34 - we had five percent selectivity so
203:36 - most people they'll submit a whole bunch
203:38 - of writing samples we'll force them to
203:39 - read our style guide and all that stuff
203:41 - make them jump through all the hoops if
203:42 - they want it badly enough then
203:45 - we'll give them a
203:46 - conditional account like a contributor
203:48 - account and then they can write drafts
203:50 - and we can look at those and if the
203:52 - moment we see one of the drafts that
203:53 - we're like yeah this is ready to go this
203:55 - is solid we do a little bit of editing
203:57 - publish it and then we give them full
203:59 - access to our google analytics so they
204:00 - can see exactly
204:02 - who's reading their articles like
204:03 - basically everything google analytics
204:05 - tracks and we've got a bunch of
204:06 - additional custom filters and stuff
204:07 - making it really simple for them uh
204:09 - that's the only tracking we use by the
204:11 - way
204:12 - we use google analytics because
204:14 - at this point it's the only like
204:16 - server-side analytics are great but you
204:18 - just don't have enough information for
204:20 - the authors to be able to understand
204:22 - their readership
204:24 - this process of collaboration or lack
204:26 - thereof if there isn't any on the edit
204:29 - process how do you handle that do you
204:31 - have sort of baked in processes where
204:34 - you're giving them feedback and
204:36 - suggesting edits or do you make the
204:37 - edits and say this is how it is how does
204:39 - that how's that relationship yeah we
204:40 - make the edits for them uh and then we
204:42 - tell them what else we made generally
204:44 - uh if usually the edits are
204:47 - are seemingly unimportant but actually
204:50 - really important like the headline is by
204:51 - far the most important thing to the
204:53 - point that i'm practically the point
204:54 - where i was just like i'm just going to
204:55 - write the headlines for you because like
204:58 - that's all 90 of people see especially
205:00 - in the age of like apple news and reddit
205:01 - and all these aggregators people just
205:04 - scroll through headlines and that's
205:05 - their news like very few people actually
205:06 - click through do you actually say
205:08 - anything like a headline
205:10 - is a suggestion from them and it is
205:13 - let's say for like a better terms it's
205:15 - um
205:16 - it's uh in your hands at the end
205:20 - yeah what they write may actually become
205:22 - the headline but it's actually just a
205:24 - suggestion yeah we're clear that like
205:26 - essentially they're they're writing and
205:29 - to save a whole bunch of back and forth
205:31 - a bunch of communication overhead that
205:32 - slows things down
205:34 - we just
205:35 - apply the edits ourselves yeah um and
205:39 - people understand that they appreciate
205:40 - it because they understand that we care
205:42 - a lot about quality and we want to get
205:44 - their article read by as many people as
205:46 - possible the way we do that of course is
205:48 - after they they publish it uh we
205:50 - publicize it through our twitter account
205:52 - which i don't know how many followers it
205:54 - has a lot is it like it has a high level
205:56 - of engagement let's let's say that like
205:57 - generally when we tweet something it
205:58 - gets retweeted like
206:00 - 10 to
206:01 - sometimes 100 times and uh we also
206:05 - um have a huge linkedin alumni network
206:07 - and we get like 2 million impressions a
206:09 - month just off linkedin posting things
206:11 - on linkedin so and then of course i have
206:13 - my email blast that i send out and i've
206:14 - got like a mailing list of like 2.5
206:16 - million people so a lot of people click
206:19 - through and read those articles that i
206:21 - choose for the weekly email blast so
206:23 - it's worth it we're giving them a
206:24 - megaphone to reach a whole lot of people
206:26 - and to really raise their profile in the
206:28 - developer community
206:29 - and they take that
206:31 - opportunity seriously yeah what kind of
206:33 - pieces are you looking for because i
206:34 - know i remember in your post you
206:36 - mentioned like journalistic kind of
206:37 - stuff eventually or i don't know
206:39 - eventually we'd like to have explanatory
206:41 - journalism
206:42 - where we take like net neutrality for
206:45 - example i wrote uh
206:48 - maybe like 10 000 words about net
206:50 - neutrality and it put everything in
206:51 - context right during the peak of
206:53 - like people asking about net neutrality
206:55 - and curious about it and
206:57 - it was it put it in a historic context
206:59 - with all the other mediums
207:01 - that preceded it the other media that
207:03 - preceded it like radio
207:05 - cable stuff like that and uh so that
207:08 - would be kind of like the archetypal
207:09 - like if i was going to lead by example
207:10 - i'd say we should be writing in-depth
207:12 - articles like this um and there are
207:15 - plenty of other publications that write
207:17 - really like new york times uh the wall
207:20 - street journal a lot of them will just
207:21 - have really in-depth
207:23 - articles that put things in a historical
207:25 - context it's not just like this happened
207:26 - and this happened this happened it's
207:27 - like this happened and here's why that's
207:29 - significant from a historical
207:31 - perspective or here's what that means so
207:34 - explanatory technique
207:36 - uh technology journalism
207:38 - explanatory technology journalism that's
207:40 - that's
207:41 - kind of our aspiring goal one of our
207:43 - goals is to get people to actually come
207:44 - to freecodecamp.org every day and have
207:47 - something new and exciting that they can
207:49 - learn
207:49 - right now people just blow through the
207:51 - curriculum and they get a job and
207:52 - they're like awesome yeah free coq i use
207:54 - that back in 2017 i hear that all the
207:56 - time yeah
207:57 - we're still doing a lot of exciting
207:58 - stuff we're still here i was gonna ask
208:00 - you about that because
208:01 - it's one thing to you know if your
208:03 - mission is to educate as a primary
208:06 - mission and you mention the three
208:07 - pillars
208:08 - it's going to be very difficult to keep
208:09 - a captive audience because of what you
208:11 - just said so it's very easy for people
208:14 - to be transient given that their goals
208:16 - and their means have been covered and
208:18 - they're gone yeah so you know it makes
208:20 - sense i almost want to ask you like
208:23 - you got curriculum you got the forum and
208:24 - then you have publication
208:26 - you know how much thought that you put
208:28 - into that
208:29 - because it's pretty smart because you're
208:32 - you're answering my question without
208:33 - even answering it by uh
208:35 - by this publication being there and
208:37 - free code camp news being there because
208:39 - you're bringing them back whereas before
208:41 - they didn't have a reason to come back
208:42 - and now they do and you're sort of
208:44 - keeping them captive when yeah when
208:46 - before they were just
208:48 - you know they've they've learned they've
208:50 - gotten their job they've moved on and
208:52 - they've said hey i learned about it back
208:54 - then and that's it now yeah and there's
208:56 - always more stuff to learn right like i
208:58 - learned a lot about quantum computing in
209:00 - the past few weeks i learned a lot about
209:02 - uh you know
209:04 - micron length semiconductor
209:06 - manufacturing and stuff like that right
209:09 - so there's always new stuff that's
209:12 - coming out i mean technology by
209:13 - definition is new so there's always new
209:15 - stuff and just being able to explain how
209:19 - you know you orchestrate
209:21 - with kubernetes or how a docker
209:23 - container works what's the difference
209:25 - between a docker image and uh you know a
209:28 - docker container right or a docker
209:30 - instance i can't even remember all the
209:32 - different terms associated
209:34 - you need an article do you have um
209:36 - you've mentioned a free code camp
209:38 - mission but do you it seems like the
209:40 - roles of these pillars
209:42 - are
209:43 - distinct so do they have their own
209:45 - agenda that feeds into a sort of
209:48 - main or corporate agenda like why these
209:50 - three yeah yeah so
209:52 - we are strong believers in content i
209:54 - think that
209:55 - uh
209:56 - one of the biggest tragedies is that so
209:58 - much of the rewards of the web have been
210:01 - accrued by platforms that are basically
210:03 - just aggregating other people's content
210:05 - if you look at like facebook and all
210:07 - these companies uh they're benefiting
210:09 - from providing the basic infrastructure
210:11 - you could argue that you know medium
210:12 - fits that boat quora
210:14 - they just create the software everybody
210:17 - else comes and adds the content and
210:19 - people don't care about the
210:20 - infrastructure that much they really are
210:21 - there for the content right it's it'd be
210:23 - like you saying like netflix should
210:25 - accrue 100 of the value because they
210:26 - created such a great streaming platform
210:28 - and like the hollywood movie company
210:31 - shouldn't get anything because hey they
210:33 - just created the content content's free
210:34 - right or cheap but content is it content
210:38 - is not a commodity really good con and
210:40 - content is
210:42 - incredibly valuable and if you look like
210:43 - there's the information for example it's
210:45 - like this news publication that charges
210:47 - like hundreds of dollars a year to get a
210:49 - subscription the economist historically
210:51 - has always charged like 150 200
210:53 - a year right for a subscription and i
210:55 - think we're going to see more and more
210:57 - of these publications that are like this
210:58 - is really high quality so we're not
211:00 - going to give it away for free at the
211:01 - same time there are publications that do
211:03 - give it away for free yeah like pro pro
211:05 - publica and uh you know the guardian and
211:07 - places like that and that's because
211:09 - they're fully donor supported they can
211:10 - do that and free code camp of course
211:12 - being fully donor supported by you know
211:14 - small individual donors we're a
211:16 - grassroots organization we can do that
211:18 - we can make everything free and we can
211:19 - provide tons of content from our
211:21 - community and from ourselves like like
211:24 - paid staffers like me who are writing
211:26 - articles and things like that yeah
211:28 - so let's talk about donations real quick
211:30 - and then we'll switch gears because they
211:31 - do want to talk about meet up you
211:32 - mentioned platforms yeah so
211:35 - five bucks a month let's just say i go
211:37 - and sign up for recurring i'm in i like
211:39 - your mission i got the cash i'm gonna
211:41 - give you five bucks a month where does
211:42 - that money go
211:43 - yeah great question so first we've got
211:45 - seven people
211:47 - uh okay first let me talk big numbers so
211:49 - so everybody understands free code
211:51 - camp's 2019 budget was 373 000
211:56 - that may sound like a lot of money
211:58 - but i know developers in silicon valley
212:00 - who personally make more money than that
212:02 - a year sure
212:04 - that is maybe
212:06 - payroll for like three or four people
212:09 - right um and we're figuring out a way to
212:11 - like stretch it across seven people and
212:13 - we're also paying you know tens of
212:15 - thousands a year in servers
212:17 - so
212:18 - the answer is like 100 of that gets
212:21 - consumed by
212:22 - the by what is traditionally called
212:24 - programs when you analyze a non-profit
212:26 - there's fundraising there's
212:28 - administration and there's programs and
212:30 - we don't really have administration we
212:32 - don't do fundraising we just that we
212:34 - have quincy larson saying please donate
212:36 - to our non-profit please sir you know
212:38 - right we don't have a pr firm we don't
212:40 - have a marketing department
212:42 - uh you could argue that we could do
212:44 - better and we could raise more money but
212:45 - that introduced a lot of complexity to
212:47 - the organization and right now everybody
212:49 - who works at free code camp came up
212:50 - through free coq
212:52 - right never cleaner
212:54 - yeah i get it and i would say like
212:56 - i know a lot of non-profits that do the
212:59 - fundraising side
213:00 - and of course it's a it's it's akin to
213:02 - like a bootstrapped company getting vc
213:04 - funding i mean there's like some analogs
213:06 - there but it's different but you could
213:07 - at least i mean but the small the
213:09 - hardest way is the individual recurring
213:11 - donations versus
213:13 - having a person on staff maybe it's you
213:15 - or maybe it's somebody who's really good
213:16 - at going around to the big
213:19 - donors yeah to the foundations
213:22 - maybe that's the reason why well part of
213:24 - it was his response my point is you
213:25 - could get like a one million dollar
213:27 - grant maybe yeah but
213:29 - we'd be beholden to those organizations
213:31 - and also like that would
213:33 - kind of spoil us that's why going out
213:35 - and fighting in the field to like earn
213:38 - people's donations regular people people
213:40 - who are just working day jobs have kids
213:42 - feeding paying mortgages but they're
213:44 - like hey yeah i can spare five bucks for
213:45 - free co-camp a month or yeah it's the
213:48 - end of the year and i can just give them
213:49 - a thousand bucks or ten thousand bucks
213:50 - what about those companies though
213:51 - they're
213:52 - reaping the benefits
213:54 - of
213:55 - your work that's fine it's like a you
213:58 - know a positive externality for them
214:00 - right
214:01 - it's consumer surplus for them but
214:02 - there's uncaptured
214:05 - opportunity there i mean you could argue
214:06 - the same thing with wikipedia i mean how
214:08 - much value do you think wikipedia has
214:09 - bestowed upon the world by making it to
214:11 - where i can get good factual information
214:13 - within seconds from a relatively
214:15 - objective arbiter of truth
214:18 - yeah there's a whole lot of value that
214:20 - is not captured but that's that's kind
214:21 - of the point
214:22 - yeah but then they also have to put
214:24 - jimmy whale's face on wikipedia for like
214:26 - one month every year and bug the dog do
214:28 - out of their users when they could just
214:30 - do these other things such as some
214:32 - tasteful ads you know no use no no i i'm
214:34 - just no problem with advertising i think
214:36 - it's a great model especially for
214:37 - podcasts but but also you know like if
214:39 - you if you don't have the invasive ad
214:41 - networks and stuff i think i think
214:43 - ethical advertising could be uh i think
214:45 - i know you've decided to go pretty much
214:46 - ad free like across the board i think
214:48 - it's an admirable decision that being
214:50 - said we're back i cut you off on the
214:52 - donations thing like you pretty much
214:53 - that whole five bucks is going right
214:55 - towards programs yes and
214:57 - uh
214:58 - there's no fluff there's no like there's
215:00 - nothing else it's all right there we are
215:01 - extremely lean
215:04 - we're living lean uh i mean we we did we
215:06 - have in-depth discussions about whether
215:08 - to like pay for like a 20 a month
215:10 - service because it's like oh really yeah
215:13 - yeah i mean things are
215:15 - we just want to operate really
215:16 - efficiently like a lot of my heroes like
215:18 - you know sam walton for example kind of
215:20 - walmart on this notion of thrift and you
215:24 - can argue that like walmart has
215:26 - um not been the best employer
215:28 - or the best uh patron of of different
215:31 - communities that it's been in but you
215:33 - it's hard to argue that it hasn't been
215:35 - good for the end consumer because
215:37 - they've managed to drive down the prices
215:38 - of so many things absolutely and save
215:40 - people an incredible amount of money
215:42 - like especially families these are
215:44 - corporations that could probably make a
215:46 - lot more money uh but they're choosing
215:48 - to
215:49 - kind of
215:50 - be broader and more resilient to changes
215:53 - in the economy and things like that
215:55 - um
215:56 - that's a trade-off yeah it's it's a
215:58 - trade-off but with free code camp we're
216:00 - never going to capture all the value we
216:02 - don't even if we can capture like just
216:04 - to give you an idea less than point one
216:06 - percent
216:07 - uh i'm sorry it's it's about point five
216:09 - percent of our monthly active
216:12 - users
216:13 - donate yeah so it's it's just a fraction
216:15 - if if i can
216:17 - get a little bit better
216:18 - right well you're going to my next
216:20 - question and so let's talk about scale
216:21 - how do you what are the conversations
216:23 - you have with yourself yeah or anyone
216:25 - else in the team about like okay if when
216:27 - you said your budget was 375 000 a year
216:29 - or you're 787 right last night never
216:32 - this year this year this year 373 sorry
216:35 - 373. so
216:37 - is that is that equate to revenue
216:40 - and i guess the second question might be
216:42 - you know when you talk about
216:45 - growth of
216:46 - revenue or income dollars however you
216:48 - describe it in non-profit senses
216:50 - um
216:51 - what are the ways in which you make that
216:52 - number grow yeah so we just get more
216:55 - people using free go campus as simple as
216:56 - that the more people that use free code
216:58 - camp a certain percentage of them will
217:00 - go out and get great jobs and turn
217:01 - around and donate like sometimes we hit
217:04 - you know like a windfall like i was
217:06 - saying earlier uh we had somebody who
217:08 - donated ten thousand dollars earlier
217:09 - this month john wong sean wang um he's a
217:12 - uh
217:13 - he went through a free code camp he
217:15 - works at netlify
217:17 - and he had money at the end of the year
217:19 - and he wanted to donate to a high impact
217:21 - charity free coat camp just to put our
217:25 - efficiency our capital efficiency in
217:26 - perspective
217:28 - we have delivered 1.1
217:30 - billion
217:31 - minutes of instruction this year
217:34 - that's the equivalent of 2 000 years of
217:36 - learning in one year
217:39 - we've done that for 373 000
217:42 - that's the equivalent of 50
217:45 - hours of instruction for every dollar
217:47 - spent
217:49 - now you're putting in terms i like to
217:50 - hear so if you go to like five bucks
217:52 - feel a lot bigger yeah so your five
217:54 - bucks each month is essentially paying
217:56 - for an entire classroom of people to
217:58 - learn that's that's interesting i i like
218:00 - the fact too that uh
218:02 - that i lost my thought that uh
218:05 - i'll get in just a second
218:11 - well i lost it
218:12 - all right
218:13 - i'll get it back in just a second yeah
218:15 - uh
218:17 - one thing that uh is important to note
218:18 - also
218:21 - is that
218:23 - these people are able to do it for free
218:25 - and the scale that we're
218:27 - operating at you know it's not only
218:29 - self-paced and free
218:31 - and fully interactive
218:34 - it's just incredibly cheap like
218:38 - to put that 50
218:40 - hours per dollar in perspective
218:43 - in the united states the average cost of
218:45 - having
218:47 - a child in a public school
218:50 - is 10
218:53 - per hour per child
218:55 - so free code campus several orders of
218:57 - magnitude more efficient than like and
219:00 - granted they're trying to accomplish
219:01 - totally different things we don't have
219:02 - classrooms we don't have
219:04 - a teacher with a student-teacher ratio
219:06 - of like 17 to one or whatever
219:09 - we just do instructional design and
219:10 - people work through it at their own pace
219:12 - but it's because of those concerted
219:13 - decisions that we're able to be
219:15 - dramatically more right efficient these
219:17 - are all conscious decisions we've made
219:20 - because our ultimate goal is scale our
219:22 - ultimate goal is helping as many people
219:24 - as possible for as little money as
219:26 - absolutely necessary which brings me
219:28 - back to what i forgot
219:29 - i like the fact that you're focused on
219:31 - those two metrics you grow the number of
219:33 - free co-camp
219:34 - you know i i guess interested people
219:36 - users however you want to describe it
219:38 - and then that obviously impacts the
219:41 - ratio of donors and you can sort of like
219:44 - grow that one to grow this one or you
219:46 - can grow this one too i mean like
219:47 - meaning you know if you grew the amount
219:49 - uh from five percent
219:52 - point five percent 25 says that yeah
219:54 - okay
219:55 - geez if you double that if you double to
219:57 - one percent right i mean so you can sort
219:59 - of focus on those two metrics either
220:01 - grow the
220:02 - total captive audience or grow the you
220:05 - know the ratio of donors
220:08 - that's
220:10 - i like the simplicity of focusing on two
220:12 - things rather than
220:13 - so many other things yes to grow to
220:15 - scale yeah yeah and that's why i'm
220:18 - reluctant to bring in like you know a
220:20 - fundraising expert or uh right you know
220:23 - to try to court like personally fly
220:25 - around and meet with the ceos of all
220:26 - these different houses if you can get by
220:28 - without it it's obviously better than
220:30 - not have to do that and it seems like
220:31 - you're on that path you have these two
220:33 - numbers
220:34 - uh the higher leverage one is honestly
220:36 - the percentage yeah but uh you seem to
220:38 - be pretty good at growing the top end
220:40 - funnel at this point yeah all these
220:41 - people using it you've also been very
220:43 - patient
220:45 - so based on four years ago we talked to
220:47 - you
220:48 - and you're also and i don't want to use
220:50 - this word
220:51 - too loosely but you're not greedy
220:54 - right like there are some people that
220:56 - just
220:57 - and maybe it's i don't know really how
220:59 - you describe greed where it's not
221:02 - um egregious or so like where it's
221:04 - overly greedy yeah you know like yeah
221:06 - level yeah
221:07 - right you know you can have
221:09 - capitalistic ambitions and not be greedy
221:12 - you know you seem to have a patience
221:15 - that is uncanny
221:17 - well i avoid that i'd where it's not not
221:19 - everybody has the kind of patience you
221:20 - have like
221:22 - i don't i don't i couldn't do what
221:24 - you've done
221:25 - yeah well i managed you know for-profit
221:28 - companies before i started freako camp
221:30 - like as a school director essentially
221:31 - like it was a private uh intensive
221:33 - english program and you know i had to
221:35 - make sure that we had like a a good even
221:37 - day and you know all those metrics that
221:39 - matter so
221:40 - and i i have kind of a traditional
221:42 - business background in addition to my
221:44 - education background
221:46 - uh so
221:47 - i can understand
221:48 - the physics of business so to speak
221:50 - and that's really helpful because that
221:52 - gives me some perspective
221:54 - and it's kind of like if you're a jazz
221:56 - musician if you don't know how to play
221:57 - you can just do chromatic skill play
221:58 - whatever it doesn't sound good but
222:01 - if you do know how to play you know
222:02 - exactly how to break the rules and how
222:04 - to bend the rules to make it sound
222:06 - really cool
222:07 - uh so that's
222:08 - like to some extent the fact that i'm
222:10 - older i'm you know i'm going to turn 40
222:13 - next year
222:14 - that
222:15 - gives me a huge edge because i've got
222:16 - the like the life experience i had run a
222:18 - lot of organizations before free code
222:21 - camp so i knew like the people part of
222:23 - it and the budgeting part of it so
222:26 - i guess in some respects one of the
222:28 - reasons i'm more patient is i'm more
222:30 - confident in the state of the world and
222:31 - how things work and fit together
222:34 - and also you know i had
222:36 - my wife who has the patience of job
222:38 - and she
222:40 - had a job with benefits and and we had
222:42 - health insurance for our kid and for
222:44 - ourselves and so
222:46 - i didn't need to
222:48 - you know
222:49 - run out and buy that ferrari or whatever
222:51 - it is that you know startup people do
222:53 - when they when they exit like free code
222:55 - camp will hopefully go on forever and
222:57 - hope
222:57 - hopefully at least for the rest of my
222:59 - life which i'm hoping to live to be you
223:01 - know 90 100 like
223:03 - uh hopefully i can continue to be
223:05 - involved in leading or helping somebody
223:08 - else lead the organization for the rest
223:09 - of my life so
223:11 - everything is long term this is not a
223:12 - problem that's going to magically solve
223:14 - itself you look at how long it's taken
223:17 - to get people to you know to even get
223:19 - literacy to the rate it is yeah after
223:21 - 400 years right
223:23 - um this is going to be an ongoing
223:25 - challenge to teach people about
223:27 - technology
223:28 - we probably have people coming into
223:31 - developer land at a faster rate than the
223:33 - birth rate at this point
223:35 - just a
223:36 - thought a thought exercise think about
223:38 - which one's actually
223:39 - happening faster so i think maybe
223:42 - converting more developers then we're
223:44 - birthing them at this point so huge
223:45 - massive
223:46 - forward-looking opportunity as well and
223:49 - impact so
223:50 - let's
223:51 - do a hard cut to uh can i ask one
223:53 - question before the hard cut yes real
223:55 - fat i don't think it'll take you long to
223:57 - answer this one
223:58 - it's probably really easy even for you
224:00 - have uh have you gotten offers or people
224:04 - venture capital anybody that's come to
224:06 - you and said quincy i will buy what you
224:08 - got i would give you know whatever have
224:10 - you got something
224:11 - like how often do you get i'm not gonna
224:12 - say the names but we've had some big
224:15 - companies that like have approached us
224:17 - um
224:18 - for like aqua hire i guess i don't know
224:20 - how it would work i mean this is before
224:22 - we got the tax exempt status uh but once
224:25 - we got that people just left us alone
224:27 - because it
224:28 - you can in theory unwind an ngo like if
224:31 - somebody wanted to acquire the red cross
224:33 - it'd be like this bureaucratic you know
224:35 - nightmare and you spend so much time i'm
224:37 - sure but it is possible to convert yeah
224:39 - but that's never going to happen here uh
224:42 - and
224:43 - i'm grateful that you know those
224:45 - organizations saw value in free code
224:47 - camp but that's not where we're going
224:49 - like we don't want to be you know free
224:50 - code camp by
224:52 - acme corporation yeah or something like
224:54 - that right i just would imagine the
224:56 - offers are a plentiful
224:59 - and the temptation is is uh is very i
225:02 - mean it's not really for me
225:04 - it could be i mean for some depends yeah
225:06 - i
225:07 - i'm just a simple dude like i like
225:09 - hanging out with my kids i like reading
225:11 - books and
225:12 - uh going for runs you know i mean
225:15 - i don't know
225:16 - because i'm in this very fortunate
225:18 - position where i live in a really
225:20 - advanced country with rule of law
225:23 - order like
225:25 - you get more money it's almost like an
225:27 - insurance policy right like if i get
225:29 - cancer i'll be able to pay for all my
225:30 - chemotherapy and my radiotherapy
225:33 - uh
225:34 - or any surgeries necessary right if my
225:36 - kids get cancer i'll be able to pay for
225:38 - that so money at some point like just
225:40 - becomes a score a number that uh in
225:42 - theory you can dip into if you really
225:44 - need to
225:45 - i don't think that
225:48 - that really applies to me i'd much
225:50 - rather just be a normal person and have
225:51 - a normal kind of middle class
225:54 - middle american life then
225:57 - be cruising around in a ferrari in san
225:59 - francisco or something yeah yeah
226:02 - our left go ahead okay hard left turn so
226:05 - closing in closing we're going to talk
226:07 - about this topic because you're not busy
226:08 - enough
226:09 - with free code camp you decide you know
226:11 - what we want to do we want to disrupt we
226:13 - want to disrupt meet up with an open
226:14 - source
226:16 - event planning platform for not just for
226:20 - developers but for everybody to be able
226:21 - to just set up their own instance with a
226:23 - docker container tell us about yeah a
226:25 - chapter
226:26 - and why you're doing this and uh how it
226:29 - relates to
226:30 - at least relates to the current you know
226:31 - to the recent changes in media i'm not
226:33 - sure if it's actually inspired by that
226:34 - if you're already working on it and
226:35 - you're like oh this is opportunistic
226:37 - tell us the story of chapter real quick
226:38 - yeah so
226:40 - meetup
226:41 - was acquired by wework a couple years
226:43 - ago wework as we all know was not worth
226:47 - as much as they said it was pretty
226:49 - disastrous uh reversal reverse ipo yeah
226:53 - yeah it's it's one for the history books
226:55 - but anyway we work of course
226:58 - uh and as of october when i made this
227:01 - announcement uh
227:02 - it was a few hours after meet up and
227:04 - announce that they were enacting this
227:06 - new policy
227:07 - that they were going to
227:09 - charge everybody a two dollar rsvp
227:13 - fee whenever they rsvp'd for an event
227:16 - now free code camp grudgingly has
227:19 - 40-ish
227:20 - meetups on meetup most of our study
227:23 - groups are organized on facebook because
227:24 - it's free but some meetups will pay the
227:27 - 20 a month to have a meetup
227:30 - page which i think is ridiculous that it
227:32 - costs that much money but it does and
227:35 - people are willing to pay for it so
227:38 - we quickly did some back of the envelope
227:39 - calculations and based on the number of
227:41 - events we had it would have cost us like
227:43 - twenty thousand dollars
227:45 - extra every year not just to us but to
227:47 - the entire community in aggregate if
227:49 - they were all paying and that's two
227:50 - bucks is essentially yours to
227:52 - potentially get as a donation so just
227:55 - yeah oh there's just money in their
227:56 - pocket that they shouldn't have to spend
227:58 - to rsvps
228:02 - for the platform the infrastructure that
228:04 - hasn't changed the only notable thing
228:06 - that meetup has done in the past 10
228:08 - years was get acquired by wework
228:10 - they have been exactly the exact same
228:12 - website yeah in terms of product in my
228:14 - humble opinion and i say this is
228:16 - somebody who's been using meetup for
228:17 - that yeah i could say that as well
228:19 - because there's like
228:20 - i recently as part of this was like i
228:22 - thought i closed my account i double
228:23 - checked on it i didn't know like i'm
228:24 - closing because i thought i did before
228:26 - i think when they were acquired by we
228:28 - work it was just like i never knew they
228:29 - got acquired i just this was the first i
228:31 - had heard i mean i just been a yeah a
228:33 - grudging meet-up user as well just more
228:35 - from the they've done some other stuff
228:37 - too i i can't recall what but it was
228:39 - like you know what i
228:41 - you know if i'm if it wasn't like oh i'm
228:43 - canceling
228:44 - you know uh meet up from my life it was
228:47 - more like i don't use the platform
228:49 - anymore i don't find value in it and i'm
228:52 - like wow if i if you leave a profile
228:54 - somewhere at least your data is still
228:55 - there so there's still this
228:57 - um
228:58 - opportunity for them to use you
229:00 - when you've since gone away so my
229:02 - thought was like i'm gonna pull my
229:04 - account and not do that anymore well
229:06 - what i love about the open source
229:07 - community is like we don't have to put
229:09 - up with that stuff if we don't want to
229:11 - that being said somebody has to step up
229:13 - and like throw some code on the table or
229:15 - a spec on the table yeah you know that's
229:17 - one of the things we talked with uh
229:18 - siege bot about what they're doing with
229:21 - the federated you know replacement for
229:23 - the package management uh what's it
229:25 - called a camera with the name of it all
229:26 - of a sudden
229:27 - yeah and tropical topic yeah you know
229:28 - and just the fact that it's like well we
229:30 - could all sit around and complain hey as
229:32 - people who talk in the microphones a lot
229:34 - some something that we do is the easiest
229:35 - thing for us to do is to complain yeah
229:37 - we complain quite a bit but in the open
229:39 - source world it's like hey we can
229:40 - actually solve some of these problems
229:41 - and that's why i was just
229:43 - impressed by the announcement and you
229:44 - guys at least beginning of an effort to
229:46 - say you know what meetup has value these
229:49 - this is the thing that needs to exist
229:51 - but it's not like it's irreplicable or
229:53 - replaceable so
229:55 - it's not that complicated so yeah
229:58 - we quickly made an announcement like i
230:00 - thought about it really hard
230:02 - i
230:03 - just decided yes this is important
230:05 - enough this is going to make a big
230:06 - enough difference for just us that it's
230:09 - worth having self-hosted chapter
230:11 - management tool i mean that's what it is
230:14 - it's for multi-chapter organizations so
230:16 - we're not trying to boil the ocean and
230:17 - just say we're all events everywhere
230:19 - just like meetup is right we're just
230:21 - focused on like you know the ymca or the
230:24 - boys and girls club of america or rotary
230:26 - club
230:27 - lions club some of these other
230:28 - organizations that have lots of chapters
230:30 - they can just have their own server
230:32 - they can have full control of the data
230:34 - and people can go there and set up
230:36 - events and and they can have chapter
230:38 - organizers and uh then
230:41 - they can have some discovery within
230:43 - their own organization and they can just
230:44 - have a little subdomain or sub directory
230:47 - that's like you know ymca.com chapter or
230:50 - women who code
230:51 - org slash chapter or something like that
230:53 - right
230:54 - so
230:55 - as far as how i was coming along
230:57 - i tweeted out this kind of somewhat
230:59 - angry tweet by quincy larson uh
231:02 - relatively emotionless tweet standards
231:05 - um
231:06 - and a lot of people were like yeah
231:07 - that's messed up you know like it was
231:09 - like a i think it was a tweet of the
231:10 - screenshot of like the meet up
231:12 - their announcement cheerful announcement
231:14 - oh great news i'm worried is everybody
231:16 - right yeah this is actually gonna
231:18 - slightly reduce your cost as an
231:20 - organizer and pass like massive costs
231:21 - onto the community but anyway uh
231:24 - a lot of people retweet it and i had a
231:26 - little link to a discord room which uh
231:28 - discord is not open source course but it
231:30 - is pretty convenient for just organizing
231:32 - an impromptu thing i've used it for
231:34 - hackathons and stuff um so everybody
231:36 - jumped in there and we got like a
231:38 - thousand people jump in most of them
231:39 - just of course promptly left and forgot
231:40 - about it but some of them stayed and we
231:42 - started brainstorming like what kind of
231:44 - tools are we going to use what what's
231:45 - the user
231:46 - story you know what are they going to
231:48 - look like who are the roles
231:50 - and we quickly got a lot of stuff ironed
231:52 - out like at the schema
231:54 - got uh
231:56 - like an api documentation up got an api
231:59 - up
232:00 - um so now we're just building a lot of
232:01 - the additional functionality we need for
232:03 - our mvp but soon it'll be out and of
232:06 - course it won't be amazing right off the
232:08 - bat but eventually it'll be great i love
232:10 - this of course it won't be amazing
232:12 - there's a theme but eventually it'll be
232:13 - great that's right i like that theme for
232:14 - the show eventual greatness
232:19 - so
232:21 - how do people get involved i mean
232:22 - typical github flow like
232:24 - find chapter in the show notes and like
232:26 - get involved because it's a thing that
232:28 - uh we could all could use and if you
232:30 - could use it and you want to have
232:32 - seems like to me
232:34 - pretty easy entry low hanging like
232:36 - collaborator fruit like hey here's a
232:37 - pretty open project that's still getting
232:39 - itself figured out that's the best time
232:41 - to get involved because like huge impact
232:43 - like you can be you can be a big
232:44 - contributor early on
232:46 - uh check out chapter from the free code
232:49 - camp crew
232:51 - yeah
232:52 - is it
232:53 - would you say it's a meet-up alternative
232:56 - though
232:56 - well
232:57 - i have a question if if the answer is
232:58 - yeah then i gotta call it i mean it's
233:00 - for our purposes yeah as a as an ngo
233:03 - that has lots of chapters around the
233:05 - world absolutely like we're not gonna
233:06 - use meat up anymore you're solving your
233:08 - own problem first and hopefully this the
233:09 - problem you have is is multiplied by
233:12 - many others yeah well i'm confident it
233:14 - is yeah sure it is but even if only we
233:16 - used it internally it still be it's just
233:18 - fine twenty thousand dollars in savings
233:20 - and also the pride of us being able to
233:21 - go in and tweak things and not having
233:23 - all of our user data just be like
233:25 - owned by wework and they're desperate
233:27 - you know cash squeezing efforts so what
233:30 - about more traditional meetups so like
233:33 - we have the nebraska javascript meetup
233:34 - it's just a very typical javascript
233:36 - meetup is chapter it's not multi-chapter
233:39 - it's just like well we do a meetup ever
233:40 - and you can you can run like
233:42 - you can run your own instance it's just
233:43 - 20 bucks for whatever five bucks to get
233:46 - like a tiny little server that'll run it
233:47 - yeah we're trying to like make it as
233:49 - compact as possible like instead of
233:51 - using
233:52 - uh elasticsearch for example we're just
233:54 - gonna use postgresqueries um so little
233:57 - tweaks like that that just reduce the
233:58 - number of services we have to have
234:00 - running in it in a docker container yeah
234:03 - has the idea of federated ever yeah made
234:05 - it into the into and how did that go
234:08 - i mean not necessarily from a
234:09 - technological perspective but just like
234:11 - a way that you can opt into being part
234:13 - of a shared discovery network right
234:15 - exactly right because the main benefit
234:17 - of meetups yeah exactly discovery yeah
234:19 - right
234:20 - that's the that's the only benefit i
234:22 - mean if you if you have your own
234:24 - organization you already have a mailing
234:25 - list of tons of people your people know
234:27 - your website and they're visiting it
234:28 - already then you don't need to worry as
234:31 - much about discovery but it's it's still
234:32 - a nice thing to have well you still go
234:34 - there and check your interests too so if
234:36 - a new group comes up near you
234:38 - geographically
234:40 - let's say my interests are javascript
234:42 - and ruby well anytime anything touches
234:44 - those two
234:45 - areas then i'm going to get notified so
234:47 - it
234:48 - you wouldn't want to just prop up your
234:50 - tent without an audience
234:52 - and
234:54 - no opportunity for
234:56 - discovery yeah yeah you wouldn't i was
234:58 - curious about that i mean this could
234:59 - eventually come to
235:02 - a displaced
235:04 - meet up in a lot of respects but that's
235:06 - not our goal at this point even though
235:07 - initially i was like so angry at meetup
235:09 - i was like yeah let's let's just create
235:10 - a made-up killer but that's not how i
235:12 - think like when i'm thinking
235:13 - clear-headedly and i don't see red
235:15 - um i think i think practically what can
235:17 - we do for our organization what can we
235:19 - do for our community and this is a right
235:22 - scope right scale tool
235:24 - right that's going to work for them
235:26 - well it's been five years four since we
235:28 - last talked five since the inception
235:30 - this is your fifth year anniversary
235:33 - uh similar question in the companion
235:34 - podcast you asked us which was hey
235:37 - what's the next five years like for you
235:38 - what what's the future hold for you are
235:40 - you
235:41 - lack of visionary like i am currently or
235:43 - are you visionary and you've got lots of
235:45 - ambition
235:46 - i have an incredible amount of things
235:47 - i'd like to do a lot of it comes down to
235:50 - how much we have in our budget because
235:52 - we don't want to overextend ourselves
235:53 - we're a tiny organization we want to
235:55 - make sure everything we do we do
235:57 - properly and that we're not spreading
235:59 - ourselves too thin so
236:02 - if we can continue to grow our budget
236:03 - we'd like to
236:04 - do a lot more
236:06 - explanatory journalism and explain a lot
236:08 - more about technology and put tech news
236:11 - in context
236:13 - through really in-depth primers
236:15 - we'd like to create a lot more really
236:17 - good first party courses and we'd like
236:19 - to create a lot more interactive
236:21 - curricula
236:22 - we'd love to be able to figure out a way
236:24 - that we could pay for servers so that we
236:25 - could actually have
236:27 - linux focus challenges uh get focused
236:30 - challenges all these things that require

236:46 - browser-based python tools
236:48 - but
236:50 - we'd really like to be able to actually
236:52 - have full development environments like
236:54 - on a server that is showing up
236:56 - on freecodecamp that you yourself have
236:58 - your own little mini you know
236:59 - compartment on the server it costs a lot
237:01 - of money yeah so yeah
237:03 - if we if we're able to increase the
