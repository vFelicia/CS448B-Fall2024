00:01 - in this video I'm going to teach you how
00:05 - to create a website just like other
00:07 - professionals do it now you will find
00:10 - yourself tempted to memorize the code
00:11 - but in reality most programmers don't
00:15 - memorize the code at all they usually
00:17 - follow documentation and anytime they
00:19 - want to remember something they just
00:21 - copy it from the other files so don't
00:23 - feel tempted to memorize everything to
00:26 - get started you want to go ahead and
00:27 - open your web browser because we're
00:30 - going to install the required software
00:31 - but before we do so I want to go ahead
00:34 - and talk to you about HTML which is the
00:36 - first language you're gonna have to
00:37 - learn in order to create a website so
00:39 - hTML is not a programming language
00:42 - instead it's a markup language so
00:44 - basically a markup language is like the
00:47 - outside template of your website so to
00:50 - give you a demonstration on how this
00:51 - will work let's visit a very simple
00:55 - website like like for instance this
00:58 - website what saw out if I were to click
01:01 - on I want to open a source code so yep
01:04 - you're gonna right click on the web page
01:06 - and click on View page source
01:08 - all right there we go this is more
01:10 - legible so if we scroll down everything
01:13 - it's from here down until about here is
01:17 - HTML then we have HTML right here
01:22 - downwards so this may look a little
01:25 - tempting but don't worry this is a very
01:28 - large website very large scale it has a
01:30 - lot of JavaScript a lot of indentation
01:33 - so there's no need to worry about doing
01:37 - this and has some styling in the middle
01:38 - so it's not like pure HTML so no need to
01:42 - compare but every web site is so
01:45 - basically the every web site has to be
01:48 - outputting in HTML because the browser
01:50 - can only read HTML now for this course
01:53 - you will need a browser and a text
01:54 - editor so for a browser I have Google
01:57 - Chrome but you can choose your own so
01:59 - for our text editor we will be using
02:02 - visual studio code so you can go
02:04 - together from code visual studio
02:09 - now you want to go ahead and download
02:11 - this please just do the code and then so
02:15 - while you're setting I have it installed
02:17 - already but while you're setting it up
02:18 - it'll ask you an option to add it to
02:21 - like the file context menu like with LC
02:23 - like open with Co which is generally
02:26 - this so if I were to open my file
02:28 - explorer like here for instance I can
02:31 - just click on open a code and I'll be
02:33 - able to open it with Visual Studio
02:34 - coding on your on your desktop or
02:37 - anywhere you want to create a file I
02:39 - mean this is where we're gonna store our
02:40 - website a basically a new folder this
02:43 - and you want to call this folder web
02:46 - development course so inside of that
02:48 - folder now today we're gonna be creating
02:50 - three websites in which two websites are
02:54 - just sand boxes so they're not gonna
02:55 - look very pretty
02:56 - the first website is gonna be called
02:59 - it's going to be called HTML sandbox now
03:03 - you can do the manual way of creating
03:05 - folder but if you want you can follow
03:08 - along and download get bash from I'll
03:12 - show you where you can get it from just
03:15 - search on google get bash this the
03:19 - second link and it's download the
03:21 - Windows version and then you can get get
03:24 - bash and then so these are basically
03:27 - Unix commands available on Windows so
03:30 - this will allow you to do is use like
03:33 - sort of like Linux commands on a Windows
03:36 - system so I'm gonna go ahead and make
03:39 - the font size bigger so you can read it
03:41 - alright so now you want to go in and you
03:44 - want to create a new file inside of this
03:46 - folder so for the UNIX command for
03:49 - creating a new file is touch and then
03:53 - the name of the file which is index out
03:55 - HTML which one Korea but we do not want
03:57 - to create inside this folder we will
03:59 - create a new folder which is a directory
04:02 - in which you will say make door so
04:04 - basically make directory what do you
04:06 - want to call your folder well I want to
04:08 - call it
04:09 - HTML underscore sandbox and you'll see
04:15 - it's created here now we want to get
04:17 - inside our folders you can create our
04:19 - next files now we want to go ahead and
04:22 - see
04:22 - so basically go into that folder in
04:24 - which what we call but well I should say
04:26 - you don't remember what you call this
04:28 - folder and you don't have this open so
04:31 - you can use a command called LS it'll
04:34 - tell you what folders you have so you
04:35 - can see here I have HTML sandbox so now
04:38 - I'm going to basically do CD into HTML
04:41 - underscore sandbox
04:43 - now I'm inside of HTML sandbox and you
04:47 - can clearly verify for right here so
04:49 - inside of here I want to talk about in
04:52 - that's how HTML so index.html is the
04:55 - entry point for a website home page so
04:57 - whenever you upload the website to a
04:59 - server to a service whatever it's gonna
05:02 - look for index.html to load your web
05:04 - page so basically your home page now you
05:07 - do not want to call it home dot HTML the
05:10 - server is not going to know which file
05:11 - to open you're just going to show a
05:13 - directory list of files and then let the
05:15 - user decide but we do not want to let
05:17 - the user decide on what file to open in
05:19 - which we will specify index.html now you
05:25 - can go ahead now we can do an LS here
05:27 - and see we have index.html and if I were
05:31 - to open this you will see index our HTML
05:33 - now at this point you can go ahead and
05:36 - right-click inside the folder and click
05:37 - on open with code but if you follow the
05:40 - other method of just using windows
05:43 - itself it's simple just new new folder
05:46 - and just follow along now for a dog dog
05:48 - HTML extension now you may not have this
05:51 - available at your first just want to go
05:54 - down to view and write and check file
05:57 - name extensions which will allow you
05:59 - this now you can either right click in
06:03 - here and fold and click on open with
06:05 - code but I'm not gonna do that
06:07 - if you have git bash and you and when
06:10 - you were installing visuals to your
06:11 - clothing and clicked on add visual
06:13 - studio to pass then you should be able
06:16 - to do code and then dart for inside this
06:18 - folder and they'll open visual studio
06:20 - code on its own now you'll see that
06:24 - visual studio code that it displays
06:27 - index.html now do not be worried by just
06:29 - looking at the format this text editor
06:31 - is mate might be overwhelming for some
06:34 - of you but don't worry it's
06:36 - simple now one extension busy extension
06:40 - so let me talk with sentience for a
06:41 - while so extensions are like add-ins for
06:44 - a text letter which make them more and
06:45 - more powerful so you can see here have a
06:47 - couple of extensions but one extension
06:49 - we will need it's called live server
06:53 - right here so you want to go ahead and
06:56 - click install and install and
06:58 - automatically but if so basically I will
07:00 - show you them what the live server does
07:02 - so you have two options of viewing that
07:05 - so go ahead and type hello world here to
07:07 - stimulate that and now go ahead and go
07:10 - back to your files and now you have two
07:12 - options you can either open this file
07:15 - manually double clicking now the
07:18 - downside to opening like that is almost
07:20 - split screen for a second the downside
07:23 - for opening that way is let's just a
07:25 - triad whole world and I save here so if
07:28 - I do say ctrl s for save I had to come
07:31 - back here and reload which can be tiring
07:35 - as soon as you get into more so what
07:38 - that so what live server does for us is
07:40 - it allows us to just right click and
07:43 - click on open with live server so inside
07:48 - a live server you can see it has went
07:51 - ahead and opened it for us now if I were
07:55 - to split screen these now it will give
07:58 - me some alerts to let me know about so
08:00 - now I can just gonna do how I can like
08:03 - remove the house and then do control s
08:05 - and visual pseudocode and it should
08:09 - automatically so it won't automatically
08:11 - reload right now until we get into
08:14 - talking about the structure of a web
08:17 - page then I'll show you reloading but
08:19 - basically if I click ctrl s inside a
08:21 - code editor it should automatically
08:23 - reload the browser so now if you want to
08:26 - increase the font size which is inside
08:28 - of file preferences and settings and
08:31 - you're gonna control the font size so
08:32 - I'm going in for this purpose of the
08:34 - video I'm your 20 all right so now this
08:39 - should be pretty big all right now let's
08:42 - going to talk about the structure of a
08:44 - web page so each web page has a
08:46 - structure and now we're creating HTML
08:50 - file but there's different types of HTML
08:53 - and now we're learning html5 which is
08:55 - the latest everyone use is everyone's
08:57 - using it basically so every webpage is
09:00 - displayed in that and Google and all
09:02 - browsers are supported now here's one
09:04 - thing if you if you haven't just defined
09:07 - like Chrome as your default browser and
09:08 - it opens live server and edge just going
09:11 - to copy the URL close out of it open
09:15 - Chrome paste it in just give it a second
09:20 - and ocean this should be fine now we
09:24 - want to declare this document as an
09:26 - html5 document so there's this weird
09:30 - syntax you have to learn its angle
09:32 - bracket open explanation point doctype
09:34 - and HTML now once again just in case if
09:38 - you is doctype and then HTML now you do
09:41 - not have to do capitalize as i sometimes
09:44 - become lazy and just do like that
09:47 - totally dependent on you but the main
09:50 - point is you're getting the main point
09:51 - of doctype and an HTML so basically this
09:54 - is declaration of the defines that this
09:57 - is an html5 document so no one can come
10:00 - now and say there's a HTML for HTML 3
10:02 - which ever like it doesn't matter now we
10:06 - want to create the roots of this web
10:08 - page so our roots live inside an element
10:11 - called HTML so now all elements come in
10:14 - pairs so if I were to do HTML so I start
10:18 - angle bracket HTML sound watch what
10:21 - happens as soon as I break my right
10:22 - angle bracket automatically the ESCOs
10:26 - tries to be helpful and gives us the
10:30 - second pair so now all elements come in
10:32 - pairs so it makes sense why I did that
10:34 - now if you press ENTER between it
10:36 - creates this space which is totally fine
10:38 - the space is totally fine in which
10:40 - inside we're gonna call something called
10:42 - nesting elements so we're gonna nest
10:44 - another element inside of this so now we
10:48 - want to where would we define the web
10:50 - page title because if we go here you can
10:52 - see visual studio code as its own title
10:54 - but here we have like 127.0.0.1 port
10:58 - number 550 500 index our HTML this is
11:01 - not very user friendly so inside if you
11:04 - here we want to go to head element so
11:08 - now the same thing press enter in
11:09 - between elements which will give you the
11:11 - space inside a head elements we can
11:13 - define the meta information the titles
11:15 - style sheets everything so mostly
11:18 - anything that isn't displayed on the
11:21 - webpage is usually going to be in here
11:22 - and it's like external so we can go in
11:26 - and create a title element and now let's
11:28 - call this title hello world and if I
11:33 - save not reload here hello world now I
11:38 - can change this to anything and call it
11:40 - HTML and now if I save here it
11:42 - automatically reloads here because it
11:45 - has the necessary tasks to reload but
11:48 - now I'm we're just gonna stick to the
11:49 - title HTML sandbox because this is only
11:52 - has our sandbox where we play with HTML
11:54 - code we creating you we like create
11:56 - elements all that fun stuff don't worry
12:00 - it's not gonna be hard this is a
12:01 - challenge so now inside of here we don't
12:04 - create a body so now body is where the
12:07 - elements are visible to the user so if I
12:10 - do body now inside of your you can do
12:12 - this is everything you type in here
12:15 - gibberish even is displayed to the user
12:18 - all right but this is very small but I'm
12:21 - gonna teach you tags that will make a
12:23 - very bigger now let me save this once
12:27 - again hTML is on the more go so right
12:31 - now our webpages are not going to look
12:33 - as beautiful until we get to something
12:35 - called CSS which is cascading style
12:37 - sheets now do not worry about CSS right
12:40 - now as I will go over that in this video
12:43 - don't worry but you'll eventually get to
12:45 - that so I want to go ahead and teach you
12:49 - something on so mouse display element on
12:52 - a web page so gonna do h1 once again
12:56 - visual studio code becomes helpful so
12:59 - let me explain to you what's going on so
13:01 - we're in jizan type go ahead and type
13:02 - hello world and then you have like you
13:06 - have hello world displayed on your
13:07 - browser yeh so just have created your
13:09 - first web page now let me tell you what
13:13 - is basically happening here so here's
13:15 - what you're saying
13:17 - hey browser this is html5 document so
13:20 - this tag you're telling the browser this
13:23 - is html5 and then now we're calling for
13:26 - browser again disturbing the browser
13:27 - again and be like hey browser here's the
13:30 - root of our webpage and then hey browser
13:33 - take our meta information and our title
13:35 - a browser
13:36 - I want this title to be the title of my
13:39 - webpage now hey browser close the header
13:42 - because I finished my meta and then now
13:45 - we're hey browsers start to open
13:47 - workspace we're gonna start and then
13:48 - each one so this is a one heading so
13:54 - this is a largest heading available in
13:56 - HTML so you're basically saying the
14:00 - brother hey browser
14:01 - give me a heading one by declaring this
14:04 - so anything inside is h1 is gonna look
14:07 - very similar until you get into CSS but
14:09 - this is one heading this is one element
14:12 - you just have successfully created an
14:14 - HTML element that displays on a web page
14:16 - so now this isn't very helpful to us
14:19 - just learning h1 so let's just say I
14:22 - want to comment this so comments are
14:24 - useful to let like if I other developer
14:26 - was to come over and wants to see how
14:28 - much work you put into your webpage they
14:31 - can come over and then see that oh so
14:34 - this means this that means that
14:36 - basically so how will we put this in
14:40 - like human form like how will we tell
14:42 - another human that this is an h1 element
14:45 - that says our world without it them
14:48 - actually open the code so that's where
14:50 - comments come in so we go laughing go
14:52 - bracket exclamation point double hyphens
14:57 - and then inside it there you can type
14:59 - anything so videos to your code has
15:01 - become inside you that and then so
15:04 - basically that's the beginning of that
15:06 - comment and then you can close a comment
15:07 - just like that and then inside of this
15:10 - you can put a comment so we're gonna say
15:12 - hello world
15:14 - okay now comments are not displayed to
15:17 - the user so everything in the comment is
15:20 - going to be displayed here not hear
15:23 - anything on comments is only displayed
15:25 - to the developer that's working inside
15:27 - the code editor so while this is not you
15:30 - fall at the moment where doesn't start
15:32 - so now we want the clip now to declare a
15:34 - comment inside Visual Studio code the
15:36 - fastest way is to control and then you
15:40 - might press ctrl on your keyboard and
15:41 - then forward slash and increase the
15:44 - automatic comment so let's talk about
15:46 - all of our headings so I'm gonna create
15:48 - a comment of headings so now we couldn't
15:53 - merrily type out h1 which takes a lot of
15:56 - time but I want to show you visuals to
15:57 - your code shortcut just type h1 and then
16:00 - tab it will create this h1 element for
16:03 - us so inside of this h1 I want to go so
16:08 - we're creating like a cheat sheet
16:09 - sandbox sort of thing so it's like easy
16:11 - for you to study with so I won't put
16:14 - some text in here which is gonna help
16:17 - you understand h1 so this is a heading
16:20 - with an h1 time so you can put almost
16:23 - anything in the sound of h1 so any word
16:26 - add anything you basically want but for
16:29 - the purpose of this video I'm just gonna
16:31 - put heading with h1 tags so like we know
16:34 - that's the h1 like you do not want to
16:36 - mess this up so now we're using our
16:39 - short cover and create another element
16:41 - which is the h2 which is going to be
16:44 - smaller than our each one but not
16:46 - significantly so heading with h2 time
16:51 - and it's definitely it is smaller now
16:54 - you will see that by default some of
16:58 - these have like space in between of them
17:01 - now we can get rid of that space using
17:03 - CSS but don't worry we'll get to that as
17:06 - well the next element you want to create
17:08 - is a h3 so this is a heading with an h3
17:12 - tag now you can go on out going to now
17:15 - there's six types of heading so you can
17:17 - go ahead and move on and create your own
17:19 - element until it's eight six so going to
17:23 - explore alright so now we have created
17:25 - six different headings now you can see
17:28 - eight six it's pretty tiny I'm pretty
17:30 - sure no one's to read that on a web page
17:32 - so for that that's what CSS exists so
17:36 - you know how to deal with this mini
17:38 - eight six which in reality I haven't
17:40 - used a six and a long time since doing
17:42 - web development
17:43 - so now we've I've showed you headings
17:46 - but it doesn't look very pretty like
17:49 - headings
17:50 - they're like bolded so you don't want
17:52 - your text like that so that's why
17:53 - paragraphs exist so put another comment
17:55 - and I'm gonna say paragraph so now
17:59 - there's only one time to remember about
18:01 - paragraph so yeh we don't have to
18:02 - remember too much so you want to pee cow
18:05 - now inside these P tags we want to go
18:09 - ahead and type any paragraph one so
18:12 - inside this is a paragraph but that
18:14 - isn't very helpful at all
18:17 - now that is helpful indeed but it isn't
18:20 - very helpful to us to like display like
18:23 - a paragraph so now there's a now let's
18:26 - just say we're prototyping a website
18:27 - like testing a website to see how it
18:29 - will look and play around we might not
18:31 - have content so for that reason Visual
18:34 - Studio has a very handy tag which is
18:38 - Laura and then now how many words you
18:41 - want so we can see even 3,000 words 3
18:44 - million whatever but I want 30 words
18:47 - alarm so you do Lauren 30 tab and just
18:51 - develop 30 words and lorem ipsum which
18:53 - is dummy text basically so now this is
18:57 - how a paragraph look like now Google
18:59 - Chrome might prompt you to translate the
19:01 - page just because lorem is not pure
19:04 - English but yeah you don't have to worry
19:06 - about that now let's talk about links so
19:11 - now you go on a web page on visuals to a
19:14 - web page again now we just find a link
19:17 - to click on well let's look on our
19:20 - privacy there's privacy statement so now
19:24 - it basically takes you to an external
19:26 - page now we can do accomplish the same
19:29 - thing with our website so you want to go
19:32 - and put a comment for links and then
19:35 - here the links have it so now they're
19:37 - there used a a tag with H ref is where
19:42 - you're pointing to so why are you
19:44 - pointing to which is href and then
19:47 - closing time so now inside of a crowd
19:52 - that's where you put where you want to
19:54 - go you can so if I were to go
19:57 - and like let's just say you were extra
20:00 - now this was your website and you told
20:02 - someone to go to Google calm
20:05 - number one they just have left your
20:07 - website so you just lost a visitor
20:09 - apparently just because you made them
20:10 - click on that link so now there's a
20:13 - really easy way to make this open in a
20:15 - new tab in which is so now elements have
20:19 - attributes so attribute is define very
20:21 - different things so we have an attribute
20:23 - which is called target now if I type in
20:25 - target visual studio code we'll add an
20:27 - equal sign and then the quotation
20:30 - basically this href is also attribute
20:32 - for this link so inside of here
20:35 - just type in underscore blank now
20:39 - there's would be something different if
20:42 - I click on clicked me we're in a new tab
20:45 - so we still have that visitor that came
20:47 - to our website so let's review what we
20:49 - have learned so the first thing that I
20:52 - taught you guys was that every file that
20:55 - that is a HTML file must have the
20:58 - extension dot HTML now sorry if you
21:00 - can't see this but it's really small the
21:02 - dot HTML is right here it is literally
21:05 - everywhere reminding you that you need
21:07 - dot HTML now the first time that we
21:11 - learned when creating a web site was the
21:13 - doctype HTML now this declares his file
21:16 - as an html5 document and not a XHTML
21:19 - file document so we are writing HTML
21:22 - file 5 and not any other time and then
21:26 - first begin the roots of the document
21:28 - like basically the beginning and the end
21:30 - point of the document is HTML the tags
21:33 - the HTML now we learned also that HTML
21:36 - tags come in pairs like always and then
21:38 - the head tag same thing in pairs is Z
21:43 - like where the titles held a meta tag
21:46 - everything now here's one topic I
21:48 - haven't talked about and that is nesting
21:50 - elements so here you will see that the
21:54 - title tag is actually nested inside the
21:56 - head tag and so is all this nested
22:01 - inside the this stuff is nested inside
22:05 - of the body to the body is nested inside
22:08 - the HTML tag
22:09 - head tag is also nested inside HTML and
22:12 - everything is basically one hierarchy
22:15 - now here's one thing I haven't talked
22:18 - about and that is the indentation so you
22:21 - want to keep your file neat and clean so
22:24 - it is easy to read now if I were to go
22:27 - ahead and now indentation not important
22:30 - for the browser so you can literally do
22:32 - is basic rewrite just the whole entire
22:36 - thing that we have written so far in a
22:38 - very ugly format so just watch how ugly
22:43 - it could get and you will soon to find
22:47 - out that it is impossible to nearly read
22:49 - and then we had to get out the head
22:53 - they're gonna get into the body tag and
22:56 - then inside of here we have to put an h1
22:58 - that says hello world so now this might
23:02 - be one line so yeah but just by looking
23:06 - at this if I had more of this so like if
23:09 - I put let's just say all this in there
23:11 - but let's just I was four more elements
23:14 - you can clearly see that it is becoming
23:17 - hard to read and we won't know where
23:19 - elements end we got soon as we get into
23:22 - the harder elements it will become
23:24 - harder to read so that's why indenting
23:26 - documents is better so if I was to go
23:28 - ahead and indent this a little bit maybe
23:33 - not the best intention but a lot better
23:37 - they're a lot more suitable to me so
23:41 - number one you do not want to do this
23:42 - how to doc types and one document to
23:45 - HTML and two bodies and two heads that
23:48 - will confuse it but yeah you can you can
23:51 - clearly take away that indentation makes
23:54 - the document easier to read and so does
23:56 - nesting so nest so every time you Nessa
23:59 - element inside an element just have it
24:01 - over it will be so much easier so now
24:04 - let's move on to something with
24:06 - organization so we want to organize our
24:10 - like let's just say one McCrystal it's
24:12 - now you can create a list but what we
24:15 - have learned just by using paragraphs so
24:17 - we can say list item
24:20 - this item so you can sort of create a
24:24 - list I mean not the best list of the
24:27 - world but hey it's a list alright so
24:31 - instead we're going to learn something
24:35 - proper so let's include our comment for
24:38 - lists now we have two types of listen
24:40 - hmm
24:40 - so if we have two types so now you have
24:44 - unordered list and order the list so now
24:50 - on the order list have a tag of UL while
24:53 - order lists have a tag of oh well so now
24:56 - inside of each list you still use the
24:59 - same tag so you nest list items inside
25:02 - of a list container basically so you're
25:04 - basically clearing a container so let's
25:06 - start with an unordered list so you well
25:08 - now inside of here we're nesting so
25:11 - we're gonna be nesting upon list item so
25:14 - let me go ahead and like save so we can
25:17 - get rid of this but anyway let's move
25:19 - let's type in Li so this is list I saw a
25:22 - lie stands for list item so it's gonna
25:24 - comment that up your li stands for list
25:27 - item so inside of each list item you can
25:30 - inside of every alike of one list item
25:34 - or many as you want but I would
25:36 - understand why would you want to do that
25:38 - so inside this Li let's do list item one
25:41 - and you will see they have some pre
25:45 - format tation like we get this bullet
25:48 - point for free and basically we almost
25:50 - did nothing except by ul and Li now here
25:54 - let me teach you one interesting thing
25:55 - if I were to create an li without it it
26:00 - creates it but it doesn't have that nice
26:02 - indentation of going on to the right
26:04 - like it will just stay like that so you
26:07 - can do allies basically which will
26:09 - create a bullet point but it's better to
26:10 - do inside a ul so it looks more
26:12 - indicated but once again just CSS this
26:15 - won't be wrong
26:16 - so let's just create larger list
26:23 - now you can get the idea of what I'm
26:26 - talking about now this is a nautilus how
26:29 - about odorless well we already mentioned
26:31 - that order list or oh well tax so let's
26:34 - do oh well inside if you're going to the
26:36 - same allies so we'll do list item one
26:41 - list item two now guess what an order
26:45 - list will look like I haven't told you
26:47 - what order list looks like so I want you
26:50 - to pause the video and think about it
26:51 - how would an order list look like
26:53 - alright so order list spoiler alert
26:57 - has numbers now for you guys to not look
27:01 - all the way this down so now you don't
27:04 - have to copy this time and quickly do
27:07 - some funky magic
27:11 - there so you guys do not have to you do
27:17 - not have to copy this don't worry but I
27:18 - just did this so you don't have to keep
27:20 - on looking on the bottom so if you have
27:23 - order list so bees have numbers
27:26 - basically now basically the purpose of a
27:29 - list is to organize your data and while
27:32 - this is pretty good organized let's talk
27:35 - about text formats text formatting like
27:37 - bold in our words italics underline
27:40 - highlighting subscript superscript like
27:43 - if you're like creating a Matthew close
27:46 - you might want to do exponents or
27:47 - subscripts whatever so I'm Creole create
27:51 - a common for text formatting now some of
27:54 - the most popular tabs for text
27:56 - formatting will be if you want to bold
27:58 - your text you will want to use the
28:01 - strong ties and then if you wanted to
28:07 - italic your text you would use the e/m
28:11 - tags if you wanted to underline your
28:16 - text you would you will use au tags if
28:22 - you wanted to highlight your text or
28:26 - highlight you would use the mark tags
28:31 - and then if you wanted to add a
28:36 - subscript so that will be a small number
28:38 - on the bottom which you'll see in a
28:40 - second you will see subtext and then if
28:45 - you want it to superscript which is like
28:47 - an exponent you will do the soup tags
28:53 - now let's going to test some of these
28:55 - tags out so we're going now these can be
28:57 - nested inside of a paragraph and these
28:59 - are some inline elements which I'm going
29:02 - to mention right now
29:03 - so basically inline elements are
29:06 - elements that stay on the same line so
29:08 - for instance a tags are also in line but
29:14 - since its parent was a block level
29:17 - element a block level element basically
29:19 - means it's gonna be honest um on line
29:22 - then this moved on the next
29:25 - so let me show you how that will look
29:26 - like so if I were to go in and create a
29:30 - paragraph inside this paragraph we're
29:33 - gonna type this board is going to be and
29:35 - then inside of here
29:36 - let's go in create a strong tax for
29:38 - bolding this text bold so this is an
29:43 - inline element it did not move to its
29:45 - own line like it did not do this so it
29:49 - did not move to his own line has said it
29:51 - stayed on the same line and it took the
29:53 - same amount of width as it needed it's
29:55 - like this thing did not take up like a
29:58 - whole entire space so look if I were to
30:00 - continue typing after the strong to this
30:02 - it still it took up the space and needed
30:05 - that's a inline element well block line
30:08 - element just takes up a whole new line
30:10 - so that is bold now it's going to look
30:14 - at italics this is a table italicized
30:25 - then let's gonna look at sorry this now
30:32 - we're gonna look at underlined so
30:34 - underlined it which is gonna be the you
30:36 - tax really easy to remember now it's
30:42 - gonna look at a tag I haven't talked
30:46 - about sorry which is a small tag
30:48 - so basically dislike smalls your text up
30:51 - we will see in a second but we use the
30:55 - small ties so really easy I remember so
30:58 - first that we'll just use small small
31:06 - small now you can use actually use all
31:11 - these extra tags on your own but if so I
31:14 - could do strong this text is bold you
31:19 - could do that you could do but then
31:22 - these will have like their own type of
31:24 - styling like they won't be a paragraph
31:26 - tag like you can do this to this Texas
31:29 - italics and then you could also do this
31:35 - text is underlined but many times you
31:39 - won't want to do it with an element and
31:41 - now you can see these are inline
31:43 - elements so they don't go on their own
31:44 - line automatically so they just continue
31:47 - after one another even though they're on
31:49 - separate lines now let's talk about
31:51 - spacing I could press 100 inners and
31:54 - then even have a small tag down here and
31:57 - to save this and it still comes here but
32:00 - what happened to all these spaces I have
32:04 - like I worked so hard to create these
32:06 - well apparently whitespace does not
32:09 - matter to the browser instead for that
32:11 - reason we have something called line
32:15 - breaks now you will see I did not put a
32:18 - I did not put an ending time so I did
32:20 - not do this now that is in correct
32:23 - format but this is a self closing time
32:27 - so busy self-closing tags close
32:29 - themselves like you won't need anything
32:31 - else so if I were to go ahead and create
32:33 - this break tag this is a line break you
32:36 - won't see anything happen but if I was
32:38 - to go ahead and do like a paragraph with
32:41 - lorem 20 and then like for like couple
32:46 - line breaks under that as well now you
32:50 - can do them on the same line and then we
32:52 - do lorem 10 again we have all this extra
32:55 - space due to this break so I could even
32:58 - to prove it to you do this and we still
33:02 - have extra space build our line break so
33:07 - there are auto closing tags so we can
33:09 - gonna talk about line breaks right now
33:11 - beforehand and say they're self closing
33:14 - and create and use the BR tag all right
33:24 - now let's going to move back so let's go
33:26 - back to the small tags I was talking
33:28 - about so let's go back up here to our
33:31 - disk and box now let's not talk about
33:32 - the highlighting example so this word is
33:35 - going to the
33:38 - we do mark tag highlight it and then
33:44 - voila just Texas highlighting now it's
33:48 - gonna do a subscript so this word is
33:53 - going to be a sub so just subscript and
34:00 - then this is a basically a subscript let
34:04 - me zoom in more this is a subscript
34:08 - basically but what though that so
34:15 - subscript is basically it goes below the
34:19 - word sorter and then we have another
34:22 - paragraph time this is gonna be a
34:24 - superscript basically like an exponent
34:28 - sooo first correct exactly so this is
34:33 - raised basically alright now we have
34:37 - talked about most of the text formatting
34:40 - I want to talk about grouping your
34:42 - elements but while we were talking on
34:45 - line breaks what if you want a straight
34:47 - line like your separate your content
34:49 - with well that's why what's like a
34:55 - charge exists so these are visiting
34:57 - lines to separate your content and they
35:03 - use the HR tab these are also self
35:05 - closing so so clothing so I can go in
35:10 - and put an HR between let's just sit
35:12 - here and if we get a pretty
35:15 - organizational line here now I'll move
35:19 - this so now let's go back and see where
35:22 - we could actually use the line HR so we
35:25 - can do a chart here
35:26 - HR here to separate our content width so
35:30 - we know what we're talking about this is
35:32 - all this this is all text formatting
35:37 - now if we go back our content looks a
35:40 - lot more organized like it's a lot
35:43 - easier to read instead of the other
35:45 - gibberish now here I kind of went on my
35:50 - own so I might want to do HR now so this
35:56 - is great right now at the moment so
35:59 - let's move on to grouping our elements
36:02 - so you want to group your elements a
36:04 - little like let's just say you had a
36:06 - blog article which we're about to write
36:09 - so there's an element for this is called
36:12 - a div so a div is basically and does
36:17 - nothing except it groups your elements
36:19 - so we can do div and then we can go
36:21 - ahead and group our elements so we'll go
36:23 - ahead and add a h1 say this is some text
36:29 - now we're running an article later but
36:33 - we can do like P then lorem xx and then
36:37 - you go see here this text will always be
36:41 - inside this div so it's a lot easier to
36:43 - see what's going on now how can we like
36:47 - get our groups our name so think back to
36:50 - elementary school when your teacher
36:52 - divided you guys into groups now inside
36:55 - of these groups you guys had to decide a
36:57 - name now basically that's what we're
36:59 - gonna do be doing we're gonna add an
37:00 - attribute to our div so an attribute to
37:03 - our discipline now these so attributes
37:05 - to a div that give it a name or called
37:08 - classes and ID's now you may be thinking
37:12 - what do these do well they actually they
37:15 - are therefore to identify a group of
37:18 - elements for a single purpose so
37:22 - basically for like multiple purposes or
37:27 - so you might we will catch on these
37:29 - classes and ID's in CSS more and
37:32 - JavaScript and by the way javascript is
37:35 - a programming language used with HTML so
37:37 - let's gonna create let's just create a
37:40 - h1 again we'll just call it hello and
37:43 - then a pair
37:44 - when Lauren like lorem 20 what's
37:49 - happening there and then let's create
37:55 - another paragraph to simulate this so
37:58 - Brenda have to paragraph let's add an HR
38:00 - to divide our content there so you can
38:04 - see we're like using what we're learning
38:06 - to help us learn more stuff now let's go
38:08 - add your view to this div so I'm gonna
38:10 - start with a class now a class is
38:14 - basically a name so let's just give this
38:18 - element like this whole entire group a
38:21 - name so we just called it the hello
38:23 - alright so now we can catch on this
38:25 - later with the hello but let's just
38:27 - create another one of this to show to
38:31 - simulate ID and an ID it's basically so
38:34 - basically the difference between ID and
38:36 - a div is that a div and sorry an ID in
38:42 - the class is that a class is you can be
38:45 - most used multiple time so let's just
38:47 - say we were saying that this is a
38:49 - article while she's saying no let's call
38:52 - this a hello live right just like we did
38:54 - before but let's just call now we can ID
38:57 - v to be more specific like this is all
39:00 - about your you like you don't have to
39:02 - use ID that don't even just rely on
39:04 - classes all the time but we can call
39:06 - this like hello - this is a second hello
39:08 - but Hello is more my class is more like
39:12 - general so like you can use this class
39:14 - any else where you want when ID is
39:17 - unique to itself stuff like a driver's
39:19 - license is unique to you like you can
39:21 - give it to your son and tell them to
39:23 - drive now using what we have learned we
39:28 - can actually create a blog article so we
39:31 - can put an HR and then call it a blog
39:33 - article now it won't be the prettiest
39:35 - blog article but hey it'll be an article
39:38 - so let's start with a div and let me
39:40 - teach you a quick shortcut if after it
39:42 - if I put a dot so that's how you
39:44 - identify classes you're gonna after that
39:47 - dot you can actually create the class
39:49 - name so we can call it article tab and
39:52 - then I press ENTER here to get the
39:54 - spacing voila so our class
39:58 - our class is article now so it already
40:00 - gave that identification now inside of
40:02 - here let's put in a ch3 with some title
40:06 - and then let's do a small tag and we'll
40:09 - now let's gonna say it is post and
40:11 - usually use small tagging the blog for
40:14 - who was opposed to by so let's call it
40:16 - let's say it's post by nano and if I
40:18 - were to scroll down here we have this
40:21 - extra space in between bubbling get rid
40:23 - of that with CSS which we're not gonna
40:26 - get into right now and then we create a
40:28 - paragraph tag for the article content
40:30 - and dual-arm 20y does not want to work
40:35 - there we have just created an article
40:38 - but lushes saying we want to link this
40:42 - to an external page so we use the a now
40:44 - whenever you're testing like you're
40:46 - building a website prototyping basically
40:48 - you can use a hash sign instead of an
40:50 - actual link so it will still work just
40:52 - like a normal link except it just won't
40:54 - go anywhere except we'll just take it to
40:56 - talk to page apparently yeah but it just
41:00 - doesn't go anywhere so you can have a
41:02 - link without it going anywhere so this
41:05 - is our mini blog article HR again and we
41:08 - have a blog article now you see how this
41:10 - line is sort of close to this well with
41:12 - CSS you could fix that but with HTML
41:15 - just put a blame break looks even now
41:19 - now we talked about lists which are
41:22 - great ways to organize your content but
41:25 - let's talk about tables now tables are a
41:30 - great way to organize your content but
41:34 - the tags for the table are pretty hard
41:36 - to remember and then we're also running
41:38 - out of time so let me going to create a
41:41 - table tag now this just identifies the
41:45 - table and then now we want a table head
41:47 - that is where the content will be bolded
41:49 - and that'll be like the top content of
41:52 - your table so let's do a tea head
41:55 - exactly you're behind remember this now
41:57 - let's create a table role so basically a
41:59 - row is this way call them this way but
42:03 - you don't create columns and you do
42:06 - create columns but you can create them
42:08 - right now so to create a table head
42:11 - column you do th and then let's go to
42:16 - fictional table for like a customer list
42:18 - so ID and for like they're like IDs like
42:22 - one two three four let's have another
42:24 - table head what column for our name and
42:28 - then for their phone number this is the
42:32 - end of your table head now also buddy
42:33 - now if I were to save this these columns
42:38 - are bolded that's the purpose of having
42:39 - th and T table head now how about a
42:43 - table body well we can do the same and
42:46 - then here's one thing I messed up I'm
42:50 - sorry you want to create a table also
42:53 - and copy this create a table row and
42:55 - then put it now that you look a lot
42:58 - better and then you're going to fix the
43:00 - indentation by using shift tab to go
43:03 - back now inside this table body when
43:05 - create a table row every time you're
43:07 - creating new row remember table row
43:09 - table book and then in stuff now we're
43:12 - going to change up a bit so we're going
43:14 - to create a regular table content so
43:16 - we're gonna do TD tag inside the CD
43:18 - tagging up some anything so we put one
43:20 - here for instance and then next TD tag I
43:23 - put Smith and then the next TD tag I put
43:27 - the number if I say hey you can see it
43:33 - displays here now this is very very ugly
43:36 - but this can be easily fixed with CSS so
43:39 - don't worry so let's create another
43:42 - table row and then in here I'll another
43:45 - TD they'll be one and then I'll have
43:49 - another TD which will be Smith and
43:52 - another TD which will be another weird
43:54 - phone number so I'll just come up with a
43:57 - weird one
44:04 - and then yeah sorry this should be Tom
44:09 - this should've been - okay now let's
44:13 - gonna now let me teach you a little a
44:15 - visual studio code shortcut so if you're
44:17 - using those students code you can go
44:19 - ahead and highlight this TR edit press
44:23 - ctrl shift and then down now this will
44:27 - create another table row for you go to
44:30 - three and then this can be used on any
44:32 - line of code and then we'll do David at
44:35 - this and then we'll just do 99 now this
44:39 - looks pretty ugly but don't worry CSS
44:43 - can easily fix that now let's move on to
44:48 - something that I think many people
44:52 - should be excited about and that is
44:53 - buttons now apparently sorry but there's
44:57 - only one type of button as you can
44:59 - create and I'll be with a button tag and
45:01 - then we'll call this whoops a button is
45:05 - clicked and I was gonna create our HR
45:07 - here I've discussed earlier about now
45:10 - just like everything else the buttons
45:13 - can take attributes too so we'll do
45:15 - another button and then let's take an
45:17 - attribute of disabled and it'll say this
45:20 - abled as our name now you can see I
45:24 - cannot no longer click on that now let's
45:27 - create another button and we can do it
45:29 - we can give it up attribute or reset
45:35 - and then Risa alright let's move on to
45:39 - the next type of stuff now I'm gonna
45:43 - start speeding up a bit because I think
45:45 - you guys got the drill of HTML and then
45:47 - if you want to look into this more on
45:50 - future I want to review or something
45:51 - there's a really helpful website so let
45:54 - me just show you guys you can go ahead
45:56 - and visit w3 schools calm and then they
46:02 - have an HTML reference list so
46:04 - everything I have talked about can
46:06 - probably be found in here if not then I
46:09 - mean I probably talked something wrong
46:11 - but most likely it should be found in
46:14 - here if you want to review it can be
46:16 - easily found in here so let's just move
46:20 - on to forms and then we'll go ahead and
46:24 - like then we'll have to start we'll just
46:30 - move on so let me find my notes all
46:35 - right so forth so for form a form has
46:39 - starts with the form tag so when you
46:42 - think both as soon as I press tab on
46:44 - visuals through your code it gives me
46:46 - this action attribute now by default
46:50 - it's not like so if you have created a
46:52 - website with Webley Wix you would have
46:55 - never had to dealt with this so like you
46:57 - go to this create a form and then it'll
46:58 - be submit when ever come someone comes
47:00 - you can submit it and you won't have to
47:01 - give me care about it apparently but now
47:04 - in HTML is all about your own database
47:07 - so like so right now you can be cannot
47:10 - submit this form anywhere but I'll show
47:12 - you really cool way you could submit
47:14 - this form but it won't submit it will
47:18 - instead will just create like our own
47:19 - search box sort of thing for Google
47:21 - search box so you'll see later in the
47:25 - tutorial so and here usually people will
47:29 - pull like form dot PHP or something but
47:32 - since we have none of that we can go and
47:33 - get rid of that we won't have even care
47:35 - about that so inside of these form tasks
47:37 - now inside of a form you might you might
47:41 - see the label book let's go and create
47:42 - our a chart here before doing that so
47:46 - inside we can gonna put a label
47:48 - now our label how the automatic
47:51 - attribute as well this is a four
47:52 - attribute now you now the four attribute
47:56 - is basically the name of us so I want to
47:59 - create feel for first name but if I save
48:01 - nothing shows because the 4rq boot is
48:04 - not displayed to the user instead
48:06 - between these tags is whatever displayed
48:08 - to the user so instead of label first
48:11 - name now you do not need this if you do
48:13 - not want it and then it'll still look
48:17 - the same but hey Japan now it's going to
48:21 - create our input now you will see an
48:25 - attribute is known as text a type which
48:29 - is text so now there's different types
48:31 - of types in HTML let me show you so so
48:35 - we just got a form here's our input now
48:37 - you're going to input unless anything
48:39 - almost anything so now you will see this
48:48 - is on the same line but how do we learn
48:51 - to like break your lines or some sort
48:53 - well we learned with the break the BR
48:56 - tag which is line break now this is
48:58 - still touching which I do not like
49:00 - another line break this still looks ugly
49:03 - but I see ie 34 into CSS so it's no big
49:08 - deal why so now someone now there's more
49:12 - types so one of the types of input there
49:17 - is an email type which is amazing now
49:19 - let me talk about the shortcut I just
49:22 - did so I did input and then colon and
49:25 - then you have all these types seriously
49:29 - you're gonna play all all around but now
49:32 - I can type in the type on one so let's
49:34 - do email type and then press tab it
49:37 - gives these two extra so we learned
49:39 - about one attribute which is the ID
49:41 - attribute and then the second attribute
49:44 - is the name attribute so basically
49:46 - you're just giving this field a name
49:48 - like you just gave yourself a name when
49:50 - you were born now you're giving this
49:52 - thing a name which you're not even
49:55 - worried about and then it creates an
49:58 - email field but let's gonna create a
50:00 - label so we know what we're talking
50:01 - about
50:02 - so email now this looks ugly break and
50:08 - then you need another break here and
50:13 - then we need another break here to
50:16 - situate that issue there we go now by
50:20 - default this comes with some validation
50:22 - so I cannot I can just do Jo at
50:26 - gmail.com this will let me through but
50:30 - if I were to do like Jo
50:33 - if I press ENTER yeah we're going to
50:37 - need some advice so don't worry let me
50:41 - make sure that I'm not screwing up all
50:47 - right yeah we're gonna get some
50:49 - abundancy now lets going to talk about
50:50 - the summit but I'm like because we need
50:52 - one right now apparently so it's an
50:55 - input type so we do input : summit for
50:58 - this is shortcut now by what these
51:00 - shortcuts are because we were using
51:02 - Emmet which is pre-installed and visuals
51:04 - to go so no needed work now there's
51:06 - value attributes a new one so if I were
51:08 - to just save we have a blink button but
51:11 - the value is what's displayed to the
51:13 - user so we'll say some it there I was
51:17 - going to add another line break to make
51:19 - it look good
51:20 - so now if I were to just say Jo and
51:23 - click Submit it gives me this amazing
51:27 - alerts like pre color everything so well
51:32 - you know you might want to use an email
51:34 - attribute the next time you do it now
51:36 - there's one type of attribute I think
51:38 - you're gonna love and that is you just
51:40 - have to put this here and this is the
51:42 - required attribute so if I were to
51:44 - submit this form without it which
51:46 - apparently did apparently but let's just
51:49 - say I put like a a a and then click
51:54 - Submit apparently I didn't work oh wait
51:57 - we put this required on the submit
52:00 - button so obviously you click on the
52:01 - submit button why did I even do that so
52:07 - now if I were to sum it please fill this
52:09 - field out this is a required field
52:11 - now if I were just say a it still it's
52:14 - like there's
52:15 - odd sign you can't so I can do act and
52:17 - then it's still bugging me saying that's
52:20 - not completely I can do Gmail calm and
52:22 - it'll probably let me submit yep
52:24 - probably submit and it did but
52:27 - apparently did not go anywhere because
52:28 - we have nothing to find so now you could
52:33 - now we can sit here all day defining
52:35 - attributes and all but if same website
52:38 - again now in here they have they talked
52:42 - about forms so if I were just go ahead
52:45 - and show you so this is under the HTML
52:47 - tab and then we went to HTML forms or
52:51 - input attributes here that so we just go
52:55 - into forms we have like hundreds of
52:58 - difference so I will talk about not any
53:01 - more of these forms but you can get them
53:02 - all from here like copy and paste Lorne
53:05 - it's pretty simple stuff and then you
53:07 - have improved attributes which I talked
53:09 - about one right now and that would so
53:12 - you have a disabled attribute your size
53:14 - max links and then you have like
53:17 - autocomplete your min max disabled
53:20 - amazing so quick we just talked about it
53:22 - required and let me talk about one more
53:24 - attribute which is the placeholder so
53:28 - let's just say you wanted your customer
53:31 - to enter this data in some sort of
53:34 - format so we use placeholder and we'll
53:36 - say enter first name and then we'll like
53:39 - have like xxx to show it and then like
53:43 - they can enter so that was amazing
53:45 - but before so before this even existed
53:48 - in HTML you had to do this through the
53:51 - JavaScript and then now there is one
53:54 - type of attribute which is a value
53:55 - attribute and we'll say enter first name
53:57 - but you will find this immediately this
54:00 - is basically playing tax this is not
54:02 - anything so when you click on it you'll
54:04 - still have it
54:05 - that's why placeholder is a valuable
54:07 - resource because it works it just works
54:13 - so let's quickly do a select list so I'm
54:18 - not leaving you hanging anywhere so a
54:20 - form select list I will quickly speed
54:23 - through this so we have a select
54:27 - and then you have all these extra
54:30 - attributes which once again they're now
54:32 - required by default we do option and
54:35 - then let me teach you omit abbreviation
54:37 - shortcut so if I were to do option and
54:40 - then I want to create three options I
54:43 - just do the asterisk sign and then three
54:49 - if I took that we got three options but
54:54 - they do nothing apparently so I just
54:56 - have to do option one option two and
55:03 - then option three
55:07 - and then here's our select list but
55:11 - let's just say but sometimes on websites
55:13 - you're not allowed to click on the first
55:14 - one and then there's like a weird new
55:17 - type so we can actually have an option
55:18 - and then we can have an attribute of
55:21 - disabled and then we'll say select like
55:27 - we're gonna do like - - select to make
55:29 - it look professional but you will soon
55:31 - to realize it's only visible here not
55:34 - anywhere else so being added another
55:38 - attribute which is a selected attribute
55:40 - save and then this is pre-selected so
55:43 - this option will be pre-selected and
55:45 - then your user cannot click on this they
55:47 - have to choose one of this one of these
55:50 - all right now this does look weird since
55:53 - the submit button this is after the
55:55 - submit so I can just copy the submit
55:56 - button and then move it down here
56:01 - alright so now let's talk about text
56:04 - areas which or four messages basically
56:07 - still be kind of label for message and
56:09 - it's a message and then yeah we're gonna
56:14 - you line breaks apparently because CSS
56:18 - is not available at the moment so if I
56:21 - were to do in line break there so inside
56:25 - of here let's do a text area now text
56:28 - areas are not self closing and I can get
56:31 - rid of all these attributes you want
56:32 - able to care about them and then you
56:34 - have to put nothing but for a line break
56:36 - and then here
56:39 - this is extendable and you said this is
56:41 - a message it has this weird font which
56:44 - can also be fixed with CSS so no big
56:47 - issue right now we're going to CSS later
56:50 - now let's go ahead and yeah there's a
56:55 - lot of solace so there's a lot of what's
57:01 - called input types that you don't have
57:04 - to worry about now let's talk about
57:06 - images so we do if we talk about so we
57:09 - can create an image tag with IMG tap now
57:13 - in now this is a new attribute just like
57:15 - our href attribute this is a source
57:17 - attribute so inside of here we put our
57:19 - image so we can just go to Google and
57:21 - say image literally with our images and
57:23 - just find a good image so I like let's
57:26 - just say we like that image I just click
57:28 - on a copy image or address and paste it
57:31 - in here and if I say we will hopefully
57:34 - see it but this number one this image is
57:37 - way too big number two let's talk about
57:40 - this attribute the alternate text
57:42 - attribute so if I were to say image of
57:46 - night sky let's just say you know if it
57:50 - was probably not and if I save you will
57:54 - see nothing yet
57:55 - but let's just say there was an issue
57:56 - loading the image let's just say I had a
57:59 - mistake and I made a stupid mistake well
58:02 - we will have this text and stuff so you
58:05 - just still get the message out to your
58:06 - user in some way all right now let's go
58:11 - ahead and so let me go in same images
58:15 - and it's gonna do a break time to
58:19 - actually space it out all right so now
58:24 - we're going to do that our nap ball
58:26 - creating a nav bar no I think you're
58:29 - gonna be pretty excited about learning
58:30 - by the nav bar
58:31 - so basically nav bar has an HTML tag of
58:35 - math if I do mouse inside of here it's
58:39 - an unordered list now in now won't
58:41 - create links so we use the a tag inside
58:44 - of a lie
58:44 - and then in here we don't specify where
58:48 - we want to go
58:48 - so index.html is gonna be our home so
58:51 - now
58:52 - here is where you put it home so we just
58:57 - click on home we're back to our home
59:00 - page now let's create a new page now to
59:02 - create a new page of an HTML document
59:04 - you go here a new file inside the same
59:08 - directory the same folder about dart
59:11 - HTML now let me teach you a vs code
59:16 - shortcut is or M a shortcut in other
59:19 - words if you do shift 1 or exclamation
59:22 - point basically now you will see M an
59:25 - abbreviation just click on new tab and
59:28 - you get a predefined template ready to
59:32 - go so I'm going to say this my about
59:35 - page and I'm ready to rock and roll
59:38 - I'd say about something just say about
59:40 - pain now let's head back to index.html
59:43 - and let's create another navbar item and
59:48 - we called about our HTML and then I do
59:51 - about given about now if I click on
59:56 - about what about that yay so we have
59:59 - just created our about page so this is
60:01 - really cool now I want to go ahead and
60:05 - get to talk about basically like section
60:10 - structuring and everything so if I was
60:12 - to go back to this website and I want to
60:16 - show you guys I'm just if I go back to
60:17 - the home page and I do like learn there
60:22 - will be an image here or it used to be
60:26 - there I hope still there
60:35 - it's probably yeah
60:39 - so exactly so it gives you this thing
60:43 - gives you a lot of information like you
60:46 - don't even need my hope you could just
60:49 - have read this but you know it's great
60:52 - to watch a video and learn you can do it
60:54 - anywhere almost someone's a formatting
60:57 - where would I be exactly it's somewhere
61:01 - definitely but let's just look it up on
61:05 - Google so we'll do a HTML page structure
61:09 - probably somewhere
61:16 - something like this if I can
61:29 - there there we go this is what I'm
61:31 - looking for so if I were to just open
61:33 - this in a new tab so you can just do
61:38 - open image a new tab so I can zoom in
61:41 - now so you'll see this is how you like
61:44 - basically create a web page you have
61:46 - your header on top nav and then section
61:49 - article footer aside so now I do not use
61:53 - the article tag I use so basically I
61:55 - create this whole area as a section this
61:58 - is my horse right now Bart is my aside
62:00 - and it's my footer so to give you an
62:02 - idea what I mean
62:03 - I mean none of this will be structured
62:05 - this way until you CSS so I can go in
62:09 - and structure it header now inside this
62:11 - header I like having my navbar so I just
62:14 - do now have now inside of my navbar
62:18 - so you can see they use the exact same
62:20 - time now the inside navbar we can create
62:24 - our nav bar just as I've taught you guys
62:27 - and we'll do index.html and then this
62:31 - will be our home page and then let's do
62:35 - about dot HTML that will be my about
62:39 - page now if I were to look back here in
62:43 - the sandbox and let's go into about me
62:46 - this might include on home and we're
62:49 - here yay and then outside of my nav and
62:53 - outside of my header now let's have a
62:55 - title quickly so inside the header let's
62:58 - put an h1 for inside a header obviously
63:01 - I'm saying my about page and then if I
63:06 - was to go to about it is there now it's
63:11 - outside my header loss critter section
63:12 - inside this section we might want a
63:15 - paragraph that says this is an about a
63:19 - section and then we have another
63:21 - paragraph for like lorem 20 30 something
63:28 - like that and then outside the section
63:31 - let's put it aside so this will be like
63:33 - your sidebar but it won't look like a
63:35 - sidebar so if you occur in like a blog
63:38 - or something you Marvin like have links
63:41 - to external
63:42 - categories are talking about something
63:44 - so you might want to Li and then you'll
63:47 - see like item one as you're a sidebar or
63:51 - like it would be like item two there so
63:57 - this like your snap aside to even though
63:59 - it doesn't look like it now footer
64:01 - there's something really cool about the
64:03 - footer now I want you to know so I can
64:05 - do copyright so this inside a paragraph
64:08 - tag now if you do now we one create that
64:11 - see with the circles of the copyright
64:13 - symbol you can do ampere stamp copy
64:16 - semicolon and then we do 2019 and we get
64:21 - that simple so you know a little trick
64:24 - and then we can do all rights reserved
64:27 - now on maybe the best webpage but hey is
64:30 - pretty good all right so so far we can
64:36 - create a website I mean not the best
64:39 - looking but hey it's a website so why do
64:42 - you care so now let's move on to the CSS
64:47 - so the thing I've been bragging about
64:48 - all along and you'll see why I've been
64:51 - bragging about so we could apply CSS
64:54 - directly to this file but I want to keep
64:56 - just like a separate notes for you guys
64:58 - so go ahead and close this folder in
65:00 - your text editor and go in and close out
65:02 - of your text editor and then going to
65:05 - now you can keep your browser open but
65:07 - this one close the tab because that live
65:10 - service off and then everything I talk
65:13 - about is fountain can be found at w3
65:15 - schools thing so let's just go back to
65:18 - our folder structure and and then we're
65:22 - gonna move on to basically where you
65:27 - store that project which was right on my
65:30 - desktop HTML sandbox and let's move now
65:34 - it's been create a new folder so outside
65:36 - of HTML sandbox so we're in here when do
65:39 - needle and then folder run call this CSS
65:46 - underscore sandbox and then here just
65:49 - going to open this with your code editor
65:55 - so create a new file so now we're going
65:58 - to start with our HTML because you need
66:00 - an index on an HTML file to um you know
66:05 - what's a call like link your CSS to
66:09 - because you cannot create a website
66:10 - without the index.html file so now let's
66:15 - create a style dot CSS file but before
66:18 - you do that create a new folder for your
66:20 - CSS stay organized
66:22 - one word stay organized inside of that
66:25 - folder you can gonna create your style
66:27 - of CSS all right so now so now let's
66:31 - move back to the nefesh ml we can use
66:33 - that shortcut i've taught you and then
66:35 - what's gonna name is our CSS sandbox
66:38 - now we're gonna medially go press open
66:42 - open with live server now this will open
66:46 - not if you in your default browser but I
66:50 - will going to open up on here so now
66:57 - inside of here I want to create a header
67:01 - and that was pretty div and we'll give
67:05 - it a class of header by the way you can
67:08 - give this also a class of main header or
67:10 - an ID also of main header so I can have
67:14 - like multiple so instead like header
67:15 - main so we can have like multiple
67:20 - classes and ID's between and I won't
67:22 - code in one more class let's just say
67:24 - not just only main header you can say
67:26 - like title you can do that too that'll
67:28 - be two classes is that one so inside
67:32 - this header I want to create an h1 that
67:36 - says my web site alright so once again
67:44 - very ugly looking download resets the
67:48 - size so it'll be easier now we gave this
67:51 - thing a class of header but before we do
67:54 - that you can actually target these
67:56 - elements B so let me teach you one way
67:59 - of doing CSS and that is with the style
68:03 - of attribute so adding a style now let's
68:06 - just say I want to make
68:07 - is the color of its own font color so
68:09 - they'll be color red if I save CSS
68:13 - applied alright very lucky now we could
68:17 - even do let's just say font size and
68:21 - make that 20 pixels there but that's not
68:26 - big different hundred pixels there
68:28 - actually be a lot better to read all
68:30 - right but that looks very ugly so now
68:32 - you can do all that
68:34 - the second way of applying CSS is so
68:37 - basically our main goal is to keep your
68:40 - CSS separate from your HTML so if I were
68:43 - to create a style tag in there twice now
68:46 - learn this new syntax so what should say
68:49 - on target this header so just the
68:52 - element header so I would use header
68:55 - curly brace braces and enter so we can
68:58 - get this nice format inside of here you
69:01 - can have multiple CSS Styles per
69:03 - attribute so you will see I targeted the
69:06 - element header here but if I want to
69:09 - target the class of header I put a dot
69:12 - for class let's just I want to target
69:14 - the idea of header which it doesn't
69:16 - exist right now but you could add it
69:19 - hash tag for ID
69:21 - alright so real easy right now we're
69:22 - just targeting regular header and then
69:25 - we want the color of it to be green
69:29 - alright doesn't look really good by red
69:32 - so get the point now the third way to
69:36 - supply CSS which is the most recommended
69:38 - is your external but how do we link this
69:42 - file inside of here because if I were to
69:45 - go ahead and do header and if I did
69:49 - color to be red nothing's done like
69:54 - nothing's happening here and that is
69:57 - because we haven't linked it so if I do
69:58 - a link tag now I can say start I can now
70:05 - get to go to this folder so the C is
70:08 - inside the CSS folder so if I were to do
70:10 - CSS style of CSS if I press save we have
70:15 - a color
70:18 - all right so that's now being learned
70:24 - about one attribute which is color now
70:25 - how am I gonna get rid of this now the
70:28 - first thing I want to do is get rid of
70:31 - something I want to get rid of this
70:34 - default margin that a house and padding
70:37 - whatever it has so to get rid of
70:40 - something default so like basically the
70:42 - roots are like the root of your root is
70:45 - a fasters curly braces and not even sent
70:49 - margin : zero so no more margin so now
70:54 - is gonna get rid of padding which I'll
70:57 - explain later
70:58 - so now explain padding quickly it's
71:02 - gonna create a div with the ID so let's
71:04 - use ideals practice already skills and
71:06 - call a box and more specifically box one
71:10 - so now box one it doesn't display yet
71:13 - because we had to create box one because
71:15 - is it empty so there's an attribute of
71:18 - sounds gonna do a background color
71:21 - attribute which will make it red
71:24 - now still doesn't display because there
71:26 - is nothing in here so if I was to put an
71:28 - age let's just I was to put hello it
71:31 - would display with the background of red
71:34 - but that's not very helpful now I'm
71:38 - trying to display how padding works so
71:41 - I'm inside I'm just gonna saying I can
71:43 - put box basically all right so you see
71:46 - this element so it has box right now
71:50 - this back has a background color of red
71:53 - so with margin if I was use margin watch
71:57 - what happens so I can do margin top and
72:00 - let's do 10 pixels we move from the top
72:05 - so this thing moved away from the top if
72:07 - I were to do 30 pixels it really went
72:11 - further away from the top if I was to do
72:13 - margin bottom with you and I see let's
72:14 - do margin left this thing move left away
72:17 - but let's just say I want to keep this
72:19 - red color consistent right like I did
72:23 - not want to move the red close by when
72:25 - you move the element inside so I can do
72:27 - padding top it'll be closest to 10
72:30 - pixels
72:31 - we had this color I'm gonna be
72:32 - padding-bottom that is we had that color
72:35 - too
72:36 - I'm gonna do padding left ten pixels we
72:40 - got that - I can do padding right which
72:42 - you won't see at a moment but ten pixels
72:45 - now you can see that all this it's the
72:50 - same ten pixels so there's an easier way
72:53 - to write this so you could have done
72:54 - padding basically and instead 10 pixels
72:56 - 10 pixels 10 pixels for all four but
73:00 - being it was shortened to see one more
73:02 - 10 pixels and then if I were to comment
73:05 - it so basic comment this is the same
73:07 - shortcuts of control and a forward slash
73:09 - but this is how comments look like
73:12 - so there's app for slash asterisk
73:14 - asterisk for slash so if I were to
73:17 - comment that out it's the same to prove
73:19 - it to those of you who don't believe
73:21 - comments do anything get rid of the same
73:25 - patent so I can do 20 pixels same thing
73:28 - so this is pretty consistent so that was
73:32 - padding and margin so I can get rid of
73:36 - that now I want to create a nice-looking
73:39 - header so if I can go now the font let
73:42 - me talk mention about font this font is
73:44 - very ugly
73:45 - Times New Roman I do not like it I'll be
73:47 - surprised if you like it
73:48 - so let's target our body all right this
73:51 - this is like the main so I want the font
73:54 - of the whole entire web page should be
73:56 - the same if I can do body and let's do
73:58 - font family now by default visual studio
74:02 - code gives you all these options
74:04 - Alfonse and now let's gonna choose
74:06 - sans-serif this is much better in my in
74:12 - my vision oh so this looks a lot better
74:17 - now let's gonna give this a background
74:19 - color oh let's just give it so now it's
74:24 - not all about colors so let's not like
74:26 - that by the way yeah sorry
74:28 - so to give this my website a background
74:32 - color about we just learned something
74:35 - you can get body go back on coloring the
74:37 - whole webpage will be that color so if I
74:39 - was to get rid of that and let's target
74:41 - our header but more specifically on
74:43 - targeted class
74:44 - so we've learned so I want here's one
74:48 - rule use classes and ID's more than the
74:51 - actual element will make your life a lot
74:53 - easier so dot header so inside of this
74:57 - header we'll go ahead and say well I
75:00 - want souls to save to get rid of that
75:02 - let's do a background color of hash tag
75:07 - see you cc or three three three sorry
75:11 - all right now you can get all these hex
75:15 - these are called hex hex colors so we're
75:18 - gonna do a hex color and then like pick
75:20 - your own color so Google has a pretty
75:25 - good format for choosing so colors so
75:28 - like this is your hexadecimal value that
75:31 - you would use alright so let's move back
75:34 - to our web page and then now here's one
75:38 - thing you realize that you're realizing
75:41 - there's not much space the font isn't
75:44 - the right color everything so if you
75:47 - recall from the first example you can
75:49 - change the color of elements
75:51 - it's a font color white I'm still this
75:54 - looks kind of ugly so let's do padding
75:56 - because we want the background color to
75:58 - extend it listed 10 pixels padding so
76:01 - all around not too bad those do 20
76:06 - pixels even better so this looks a lot
76:12 - better than this this is a lot now lets
76:20 - them do something more better so red
76:22 - looks a lot vibrant now let's add some
76:26 - content to play around with so let's so
76:29 - I want to style a list or more
76:33 - specifically let's top buttons so
76:36 - something that's very exciting to style
76:38 - will be a button and let's go say button
76:42 - now the first thing we do not want
76:45 - inside the header we want to criticize
76:48 - ssin
76:50 - there and then if we can fix this by
76:53 - shift-tab
76:55 - now first thing you'll realize when I'm
76:58 - zoomed in only a hundred percent so
77:01 - normal the button is really small has no
77:03 - margin so we might want to use margin on
77:05 - the button
77:06 - so let's gonna target a button because
77:09 - buttons are like general so you don't
77:11 - specifically want like you'll want a
77:14 - button to be like the same everywhere
77:17 - like you want to want your one area have
77:19 - a button that's like nine huge and
77:21 - another one be small you want them like
77:23 - all similar so for this button this give
77:26 - us some margin Barwon and i want to give
77:27 - this a margin top of 10 pixels all right
77:30 - margin left 10 pixels now to increase
77:36 - select the size of this button you have
77:38 - two ways you can use height and the
77:41 - width property so we can do height of
77:42 - this to be like 20 pixels and then the
77:44 - width to be 20 pixels but as really
77:48 - small so let's do 200 pixels and then
77:53 - just to be hundred but that's pretty big
77:55 - still it's a fixing pistol all right
77:57 - this is pretty okay let's do 25 and then
78:01 - just to be 75 I can see I can play
78:05 - around with this button all day but we
78:07 - have a better way to do this I mean just
78:09 - do padding basically and then for a top
78:13 - and bottom so on so let's see let me
78:15 - show you yeah so let's do top and bottom
78:17 - padding to be let's do 30 pixels top and
78:21 - bottom padding and then 40 pixels left
78:26 - and right all right that's kind of big
78:28 - exactly so you don't split these in half
78:30 - since they're not what you think they'll
78:33 - be it's still big but you're
78:38 - accumulating music all right this is a
78:39 - good side buddy now if I were to zoom in
78:42 - this button has a weird border so we can
78:46 - get rid of that border or going to
78:47 - create a new border so because a border
78:49 - property and unless it say none no
78:52 - border all right we got rid that border
78:53 - yay now let's go ahead and do a good
78:59 - nice background color I did not like the
79:01 - background go let's do the hashtag
79:03 - see see all right let's do three two
79:05 - three and let's give it a color
79:07 - attribute a white so the text inside is
79:10 - white and then looks a lot better than
79:15 - used to but in a hundred percent
79:18 - actually looks a lot better
79:20 - let's give it a radius border radius
79:22 - like make us circular so we can do
79:23 - border radius and then it's dependent on
79:27 - pixels so let's do five pixels border
79:29 - radius and you can already see this
79:32 - buttons kind of rounded looks a lot
79:34 - better
79:36 - let's do ten pixels we need to even do
79:40 - 30 pixels now looking the better we can
79:43 - even do 50 pixels now you can do
79:45 - percentages so I'm going to look 50
79:47 - percent which will make it like a weird
79:48 - circle you can do a hundred percent
79:51 - which is the same but you can actually
79:53 - do 25 percent yeah is like your weird
79:56 - stuff I think 25 pixels looks pretty
80:00 - good but five pixels looks better if you
80:03 - like a box button where I go along and I
80:13 - wrong
80:21 - all right so our border radius is 5
80:23 - pixels so this looks pretty nice but
80:25 - here's one thing might be realizing
80:27 - there is no like cursor place like if
80:29 - you were to click on like you don't
80:31 - necessarily need a cursor click since
80:34 - most of Chrome doesn't do it but like if
80:36 - you were on a website and you want to
80:38 - click on something your cursor turns
80:40 - like that well that's why you get a
80:42 - property of pointer no cursor and then
80:48 - we can say pointer so I want to cursor
80:50 - be pointer when you on it so whenever on
80:53 - this button little cursor yeah now so
81:00 - you will see that most buttons like
81:02 - anything that you almost hover on hover
81:05 - is the new ones like when you put your
81:06 - mouse over as a different color or like
81:09 - a different style to it so to access
81:13 - this in your styling we do button :
81:15 - hover so almost anything can have a
81:18 - hover State so with this let's change
81:22 - the background color to be transparent
81:26 - so but then we lose the text so we want
81:31 - to change it to black all right still
81:36 - good but that doesn't look very
81:37 - beautiful now let's add a border of
81:41 - let's do late one pixel border so we
81:45 - want to solve it and then we want it
81:47 - black all right those do that all right
81:50 - now bad but you'll see it's kind of
81:52 - moving and to show you that is actually
81:55 - moving do a paragraph or lorem 10 let me
81:57 - share all right look watch what happens
82:00 - to the paragraph the paragraph moves and
82:02 - that is because there's no border
82:04 - defined previously so it adds an extra
82:07 - one pixel to it which moves everything
82:10 - by one pixel so for that reason you can
82:14 - have a one pick so you want to have a
82:16 - one pixel border that just solid as well
82:19 - and transparent so no color and then now
82:23 - it looks a lot better now this is also
82:27 - very fast-moving so you can have a
82:30 - transition property
82:32 - now don't worry if you do not understand
82:34 - everything all this can be found in the
82:38 - w3 schools so now what trap is it
82:42 - smoothly feeds in so it kind of had that
82:47 - animation - so basically get this done
82:49 - and animation amazing so you have that
82:53 - as well which I mean looks amazing I
82:59 - like stir this all day so we have to
83:03 - style the button now you guys you get
83:05 - like the basic purpose of CSS so far now
83:09 - we can actually so I want to go in and
83:13 - style form so forms are very ugly by
83:15 - default and you can see this text like
83:17 - she looks pretty good if I show you the
83:20 - section actually looks pretty good so
83:22 - let's go to style form so form so once
83:26 - again we have that action which we don't
83:28 - need now the label for first name so
83:31 - let's recreate that form we were trying
83:32 - to create before and this time we're not
83:34 - have no line breaks no none that so
83:37 - input text and then look how it
83:38 - placeholder - will sing into her first
83:41 - name and then was to label yarn so for
83:45 - last name last name and it'll be like
83:50 - input type text and then we live like an
83:53 - art placeholder for entire last name and
83:59 - then have another label for email and it
84:06 - will mean looks an email address and
84:11 - then let's do input type of email and
84:16 - then have a place holder of enter email
84:19 - address let's gonna all right so I did
84:23 - not apply any styling on this and let's
84:26 - have an input for submit and put submit
84:30 - with the value of submit and then let's
84:34 - give it a class so now let me go to move
84:37 - back so looks like I say classes are
84:39 - general what if we give this a class
84:42 - with dot so we make this element styling
84:45 - into a dart so a class based
84:47 - just for class so this button change
84:48 - back but what if we give this to class a
84:50 - button and you will see our submit
84:56 - button gets default because the default
84:59 - thing now it's gonna make our button so
85:01 - we want to make a display so we want it
85:04 - to be a block line element all right
85:06 - so block so this is on its own line
85:08 - automatically right now it's gonna play
85:10 - with our form that with you earlier
85:12 - create we just created so we do form and
85:16 - let's start so now I want to give us a
85:18 - margin all round of 10 pixels so this is
85:22 - moved around but I want a margin top to
85:24 - be even more so let's make a 20 pixel
85:27 - margin top all right now let's do
85:31 - nothing else here let's move on to our
85:33 - inputs so you're gonna like nest
85:35 - elements just like an HTML your nesting
85:36 - elements here now this is an input we do
85:40 - not want to play with this so if we can
85:42 - do bracket and we just give it a type so
85:45 - I wanted to type to be only the inputs
85:50 - our text and then we can do a comma for
85:53 - another one and we'll stay input that
85:56 - and we'll say type equals for email
85:59 - because and then now we can do curly
86:02 - braces so we can actually target to
86:04 - three elements all at the same time for
86:07 - the same silent just because of that
86:09 - alright so before we move on to this
86:12 - let's target our labels and make them a
86:15 - display a block and then let's make them
86:18 - have an all around margin of ten pixels
86:22 - but only on the top and bottom not on
86:24 - the left or right all right let's give
86:27 - this five pixels instead all right so
86:31 - let's give these forms inside a padding
86:34 - of all around of so on not all right so
86:37 - on top and bottom
86:39 - I want 20 pixels and I'm left and right
86:42 - let's just do yes I could so 20 pizzas
86:46 - tops in bottom but nothing on the left
86:47 - or right all right that looks pretty
86:50 - ugly ten I think eight will look amazing
86:55 - there's seven there got seven looks a
86:57 - lot better all right don't worry we'll
86:59 - get a margin too
87:00 - so we'll get the marginal ten pixels and
87:03 - then zero left to right all right
87:06 - let's actually give this a margin three
87:08 - pixels luckily that was a lot better so
87:12 - now let's give it a width so there's a
87:14 - new attribute so we talked about this
87:16 - for width let's give it a 100% width so
87:19 - the whole entire page basically now this
87:24 - looks okay so we actually just created a
87:26 - really good form so test yeah I know
87:29 - whatever now let's give it a border
87:33 - radius so let's make a look even better
87:36 - let's give it a border radius of five
87:38 - pixels now you will see this ugly stuff
87:42 - so we just got a very ugly looking form
87:44 - but I can actually do border and let's
87:48 - fix that so we do one pixel border which
87:51 - is gonna be solid it'll make it hashtag
87:55 - CCC all right so pretty good so far but
88:02 - let's give it margin so let's give it
88:07 - padding on the left or right of one
88:09 - pixel alright so that looks a lot better
88:15 - it's a little sulfur here's our form so
88:18 - this looks a lot better so we did like
88:21 - nano and they're productions and then
88:23 - like nano productions add in gmail.com
88:29 - plate what is our email address yeah
88:34 - I'll figure that out but yeah so
88:37 - basically we just dialed our form so
88:40 - this may look a lot better broad kind of
88:43 - zoom in like if you were to zoom out a
88:48 - bit so this looks a lot better trust me
88:53 - like this looks a whole lot better than
88:57 - the previous form if you have seen
88:59 - alright so this is most we talked about
89:04 - a lot of attributes so far now let's go
89:07 - ahead
89:08 - now table styling lovely can actually
89:11 - create a quick table alright so I do not
89:15 - want to waste much time though so table
89:17 - inside this table let's just go ahead
89:19 - and do a tea head
89:22 - Deonte age only like first name day
89:27 - something like last name and then tea
89:31 - body well I like tea or teeny well like
89:35 - love it
89:36 - um and then anything will be Smith then
89:40 - he another table row you know like TD
89:44 - will be like John and then another TD
89:48 - would be like role whatever alright so
89:53 - we have this form now first of all the
89:54 - font looks a lot better so this looks
89:56 - pretty good I don't know what to say but
89:59 - alright so with the table let's make
90:02 - this a width of a hundred percentage
90:03 - like alright there we go we got a lot
90:06 - more spacing I'll give this a border or
90:09 - one pixel solid and let's do like
90:11 - hashtag thing to do alright pretty good
90:15 - but I want to give us some margin so
90:18 - let's give it actually let me teach you
90:22 - something real cool so if I were to do
90:23 - margin of nine to five same width of
90:25 - ninety percent and if we did margin Auto
90:30 - it's already Center so basically we have
90:32 - centered this and one way or the other
90:35 - and then let's target our tables T arms
90:39 - let's see if they can get a border of
