00:00 - Hello world, in this video I'll be
introducing interval notation and talk
00:04 - about some common sets. This will lay the foundation for the next video on set
00:09 - builder notation. The beauty of interval
notation is that allows us to officially
00:13 - described all numbers between two values.
Suppose we want to say that the variable
00:19 - X is between Zero and 1.
00:22 - Well, we could do just that we can say
that X is an element of the
00:26 - interval Zero, 1. Or, which is really saying X
is greater than Zero and X is less than 1.
00:33 - Likewise, if we wanted to say that X is
greater than or equal to Zero and X is less
00:38 - than 1 then we have to switch this to a
square bracket. All we're doing is we're
00:43 - now including the number Zero in the
interval. Also we can include Zero and we
00:49 - can also include 1 in the interval by using
square brackets on both sides. So it's
00:53 - greater than or equal and
less than or equal to. And now talk about
00:59 - some common sets, the first one being the
null set, which is the same thing as the
01:02 - empty set, which is just there are no
elements contained within the set and
01:08 - this will come in handy future. The funny
N here is the natural numbers, which is
01:14 - the set containing elements 1, 2, 3, and then
these thre e dots here called an ellipsis,
01:20 - which tells us that the pattern
continues. So, N is the set containing
01:26 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 all the way up to infinity. This funny N with a Zero is the natural
01:34 - numbers, however it includes the value
Zero within the set. So it's 0, 1, 2 in the
01:41 - ellipsis tells us all the way to
infinity in an integer Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4,
01:46 - 5, 6. And finally, we have all the
integers positive and negative and non
01:51 - which is Zero, negative 1, negative 2 all the
way down to negative infinity, and Zero, 1, 2,
01:57 - 3, 4, all the way up to infinity.
