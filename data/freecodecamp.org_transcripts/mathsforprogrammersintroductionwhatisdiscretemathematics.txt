00:00 - In this video, I will be explaining what Discrete
Mathematics is, and why it's important for
00:04 - the field of Computer Science and Programming.
00:07 - Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics
that deals with discrete or finite sets of
00:11 - elements rather than continuous or infinite
sets of elements.
00:15 - Imagine trying to run a program that requires
an infinite number of executions to complete
00:20 - a task.
00:21 - It's obvious to say, that the program would
run forever and the task would never be completed
00:25 - because there is an infinite number of executions.
00:28 - In order to avoid this problem, we approximate
the continuous sets with discrete sets.
00:33 - Now you may be thinking, I never use math
that involves infinite sets, but I promise
00:39 - that you do.
00:40 - The simplest example is with a circle.
00:43 - A circle by definition is an infinite number
of points equally distant from a fixed point.
00:50 - The problem with this is that if we try to
write a program that prints out all of these
00:55 - points, it will run forever because there
is an infinite number of points and therefore
00:59 - an infinite number of executions.
01:02 - So, this is physically impossible, that's
why if we zoom in here, you can see that when
01:09 - you come down here, there is all these points,
but in reality we should have even more points
01:14 - between these points.
01:15 - And if we zoom in on those, we should have
more points between those points, and we can
01:19 - never complete the task.
01:21 - Now we've all seen circles on computers, how
is this possible, because we just established
01:27 - that it's impossible.
01:29 - The answer is, is that there is approximations.
01:32 - For example, consider regular polygons.
01:36 - Regular Polygons, like a triangle, or a square,
or a pentagon.
01:40 - They don't really look like circles.
01:42 - However, if you keep increasing the number
of vertices.
01:47 - Eventually you will get hexagons, octagons,
decagons, hexadecagons, icosagons.
01:54 - You can see that these regular polygons, the
more and more you increase the number of vertices,
01:59 - which the vertices are equally distant from
a fixed point, they will eventually approximate
02:04 - a circle, and eventually they will be indistinguishable
to the naked eye and will look identical to
02:10 - a circle.
