00:07 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with Jessie and today we're going to try
00:15 - to get the authorization working the
00:20 - user login for our app and so I've done
00:25 - some troubleshooting today and I think
00:27 - I've ruled out the the email as the
00:31 - issue so yesterday we were thinking that
00:34 - there was maybe a port that was blocked
00:37 - that was stopping emails from working
00:39 - but that's not the case so I was able to
00:42 - test that out and on the master branch I
00:46 - don't have the login implemented but the
00:51 - email is there when you submit the form
01:00 - that I was going to show you but I can't
01:02 - log in right now so if we could log in
01:05 - there's a form all right so we can get
01:08 - to it on the master branch I can submit
01:11 - it successfully and I can get the email
01:13 - so that works so it's not the email so
01:16 - we have to look elsewhere so I did kind
01:21 - of scatter i scattered console logs all
01:25 - over the place throughout some of our
01:28 - node files here and I didn't I didn't
01:36 - come up with any definitive but I think
01:40 - it may have something to do with the
01:43 - database connection let me show you my
01:48 - my logs here so this is what I keep
01:51 - getting
01:57 - let's see here we go so this this error
02:01 - is is coming from client dot J s
02:05 - that's the area that I keep getting
02:07 - every time I try to log in so between
02:13 - what I was able to do with all the
02:14 - console logs and be able to successfully
02:18 - send emails and this error message that
02:22 - leads me to believe that maybe it has
02:24 - something to do with how we're
02:26 - interacting with with that database so I
02:29 - figure that's not a bad place to start
02:31 - with our troubleshooting
02:35 - so let's it was not much to see here
02:40 - just you know we can submit see actually
02:48 - let me restart this because we're not
02:54 - gonna get this will refresh
03:19 - all right let me check the live chat
03:21 - before we get started and then I'll
03:23 - start my timer and we'll do 25 minutes
03:26 - of in this case troubleshooting we may
03:29 - or not may or may not be writing that
03:32 - much code so you could see this is this
03:36 - is what happens when you submit we just
03:37 - keep getting the same error sorry it's
03:46 - just everything set up hey everybody
03:50 - CEO saying hey air in the live chat
04:00 - sebastian is asking if the the pool
04:04 - request he submitted to fix that UI
04:06 - glitch that was happening with the the
04:08 - drop down for to log out so i did emerge
04:15 - in that pool request i as far as i know
04:22 - it was working alright i didn't have
04:24 - time to test it that much so it was only
04:28 - really minimal changes just to CSS so i
04:32 - figured there's no harm in and merging
04:34 - it in but my take truth my browser stack
04:38 - has been insanely slow lately so if
04:43 - you're not familiar browser stack you
04:45 - can run you can test your websites on
04:48 - all different types of browser operating
04:53 - system device combinations so it's like
04:57 - you through your browser you can log in
05:01 - to these other devices and test it so
05:03 - for whatever reason it's just been
05:05 - really weird and slow and hard to test
05:08 - so i didn't test it yet just because I'm
05:09 - tired of the frustration of working with
05:12 - that
05:12 - so anyway it's it's in the master branch
05:16 - now so if anyone once has the code on
05:21 - your machine and you're running an on
05:23 - Mac please let me know if you see
05:26 - anything weird when you click on that
05:29 - that menu to
05:31 - logout but I think it should be fun
05:51 - okay
06:00 - all right so I have some some comments
06:03 - pertaining to the troubleshooting so
06:06 - let's just go right into that and and
06:08 - check out these comments I'm going to
06:10 - start my timer after this 25 minutes is
06:13 - up I'm going to take five minutes and go
06:15 - through the questions in the live chat
06:17 - so if you ask a question I will get to
06:20 - it eventually just hang in there and and
06:24 - you'll get your answer if you can't
06:25 - stick around for the answer just check
06:28 - out the recording of this video which
06:30 - will be available here on the free code
06:32 - camp YouTube channel
06:33 - shortly after I finished the stream
06:37 - alright so okay so Paco asks did you try
06:45 - to connect your mom go on another port
06:51 - okay no I haven't let's see and Harshit
06:59 - is asking about a user I've already
07:02 - created a user in the in the
07:05 - database so I'm using M lab just the
07:13 - free version of M lab just to set up a
07:16 - testing database so I do have a user
07:21 - created and that's the the user that I'm
07:26 - working with for for my database so
07:33 - where you have to put in your database
07:34 - user and password that's that's what I
07:37 - am using
07:46 - okay Sebastian followed up with
07:50 - initially talking about pull requests
07:52 - yes the white space was gone so there's
07:56 - no white space any there anymore they're
07:58 - on a Mac so that that issue was cleared
08:01 - up so thank you
08:33 - let's see
08:53 - okay so I'm trying to I'm trying to sort
08:56 - out Harshit is the one that that coded
09:00 - this pretty much everything having to do
09:04 - with the back end was done by Harsha so
09:07 - I'm trying to read these comments
09:10 - helping me out here so so harsh it's
09:16 - saying check your dot and file okay so
09:19 - what what do I need to check the string
09:22 - I have checked the string it's it's
09:25 - worth double-checking okay I should
09:30 - saying to use use his connection string
09:35 - okay let's see I have my dot M file open
09:45 - on my other screen obviously so that I
09:52 - don't show everybody all my stuff
10:01 - to
10:04 - okay cool so harsh it's going to message
10:07 - me the info so that I can I can try it
10:12 - with with his database info that's
10:15 - actually a good idea and then that old
10:17 - that should help us narrow down the
10:20 - issue
10:47 - okay so let me see while I'm waiting on
10:50 - on a Harsha - send me that info okay
10:55 - cool I just got it
10:57 - anyway I was going to say when we
11:00 - probably later on whenever I finish up
11:04 - with the coding and we do a question and
11:06 - answer session I'm gonna let you know
11:07 - how everything went with that react
11:09 - native that just to make a lungs long
11:14 - story short it passed the code review so
11:18 - it's officially accepted I've completed
11:19 - all the project for that nano degree
11:21 - which is awesome
11:23 - there's definitely a lot of work that I
11:25 - still would like to do on it and I got
11:27 - some really great feedback from my
11:29 - reviewers so I maybe I might actually
11:33 - turn that into some issues on the github
11:36 - repo and then if anybody would like to
11:37 - work on it with me then at least you'll
11:40 - know some of the things that need the
11:45 - need work alright so I got Harshit I got
11:48 - your your info I'm going to paste that
11:52 - now into my dot and file
12:08 - okay I'm saving that and let me let me
12:17 - restart this so you start this wait for
12:25 - that to refresh
12:33 - okay alright let's give this a shot now
12:59 - okay so waiting
13:08 - okay not sent let's see yep we got the
13:12 - same same error
13:24 - okay so since this same login info works
13:28 - for Harshit on his machine then it's
13:33 - probably it probably doesn't have
13:35 - anything to do with my my login
13:37 - credentials for the database it has
13:42 - something to do I guess with my
13:45 - development environment so well at least
13:50 - we've we've ruled that out okay
14:32 - okay hard sing hard code the string for
14:35 - now okay I can hard code it I will I'll
14:40 - do that on my other screen let's see
14:49 - actually let me yeah
15:16 - okay
15:23 - oops
15:35 - we
15:38 - first that
15:50 - okay still same there well almost the
15:59 - same we had a bit more up here the last
16:00 - time
16:02 - Eric connecting the TV
16:13 - interesting
16:20 - I'm going to try that one more time I'm
16:23 - just wondering why we got different
16:25 - messages
16:38 - okay
16:50 - okay
17:05 - hmm
17:25 - all right
17:37 - I'm gonna get off of this I don't want
17:39 - that off day Esther refresh and show
17:42 - harsh it's trying to use memory store
17:48 - for now I'll different Express session
17:57 - okay physically listen reacts yeah so
18:01 - dragon hunter the the repo is bulletin
18:05 - react
18:08 - okay so harsh is saying try to use a
18:11 - memory store for now from Express
18:15 - session okay you're gonna have to help
18:18 - me out with that because I've this is
18:20 - the first time I've used and
18:23 - Express so let's see
18:34 - okay so I'm going to remove i'll go from
18:37 - exposition
18:46 - I make that big here sorry that was
18:49 - probably too small for everybody
18:51 - I had it smaller earlier there we go
18:56 - okay okay so harsh the same I'm removing
19:02 - so I'm not sure exactly where to remove
19:05 - if if I remove this will that do the
19:07 - trick are there other places where I
19:09 - need to remove it from I'm gonna take
19:19 - that out now and I figured I'd get some
19:27 - sort of error okay so first we remove
19:35 - that okay cool
19:50 - okay so there's another place where we
19:52 - have to do this that's okay dragon
19:57 - hunter the branch someone right now is
19:59 - it's actually harsh it's pull request
20:05 - let me let me send you what PR is that
20:10 - 44 let me send you the get command I'm
20:15 - going to take by the gate command if
20:16 - anybody does want to check this out
20:17 - but you're not familiar with how to do
20:19 - this I'm just going to type it right
20:20 - into the live chat it's get fetch origin
20:27 - pull 44 and then age okay so get fetch
20:45 - origin pool and then 44 I'll put this up
20:49 - on the screen too if anybody wants to
20:50 - see this later on so this is what I'm
20:54 - doing git fetch origin pool so you're
20:57 - gonna pull request number 44 and then
21:00 - head and then at the end here you can
21:02 - name this whatever you want but that's
21:03 - what the branch is going to be called on
21:05 - your local machine so this is what I
21:06 - named it on my local machine but you can
21:09 - name it whatever you want after you pull
21:11 - this down you can switch to that branch
21:13 - make sure you run npm install or yarn
21:16 - because there's a lot of packages and
21:19 - then you should be able to to work on on
21:24 - this or at least follow follow along
21:27 - with what we're doing
21:34 - okay all right so let me go back to this
21:39 - John Hanson says I remember seeing
21:41 - something when using react with express
21:43 - and connecting through MongoDB there can
21:46 - be a shared connection issue between
21:47 - Express and react which can default on
21:50 - the same localhost 3000 okay so maybe
21:54 - maybe we're dealing with with a known
21:57 - issue here that's good to know because
21:59 - there'll probably be some some
22:02 - information about how how to fix it down
22:06 - let DVD compass see where was let
22:14 - me let me go back one so there was one
22:17 - other thing that I had to comment out
22:27 - well let's connect to the database from
22:29 - a GUI first okay
22:42 - we compass
23:13 - be able to
23:21 - could I use instead of compass the bongo
23:26 - DB compass could I just use the command
23:28 - line could I use the shell let me pull
23:42 - pull one over to my other screen here
24:09 - Harshit saying it will be very hard as
24:11 - you don't have longer that well wedding
24:14 - we should I mean all we really need to
24:17 - test is whether or not I can actually
24:20 - connect right so that that might be the
24:27 - only reason I'm asking is because I
24:28 - don't want to go through the to get the
24:32 - free version of Compass TV
24:37 - compass is like you gotta fill out all
24:41 - your contact info and everything so I
24:43 - was just going to try to avoid that and
24:46 - I wanted to download the show anyway
24:55 - oh here we go found another place where
24:57 - it's gonna let me download it without
24:59 - that alright I'll try that then I don't
25:01 - know what that other page was but it
25:03 - wanted a lot of contact info okay oh
25:09 - yeah now it's making me do this again
25:33 - I'm gonna show
25:41 - so I'm trying to install the shell
25:44 - but the the documentation page was just
25:48 - saying how to use it and not how to
25:49 - install it
26:30 - cool I think I could just use brew to
26:33 - install this let's see
26:59 - okay so I'm gonna try to use homebrew
27:01 - homebrew to install this
27:12 - okay cool let's see
27:19 - all right harsh dude I got your link I'm
27:21 - going to open this on my other screen
27:27 - okay so if you're just joining us you're
27:29 - not sure what's going on when installing
27:31 - some tools to help us test our database
27:34 - connection so I have a few things going
27:42 - right now so whatever tool ends up
27:45 - getting downloaded faster is what we're
27:48 - going to use
28:11 - all right so the compass is has
28:15 - three minutes left on the download
28:16 - homebrew is now about 15% done
28:21 - downloading so
28:33 - so we'll see see what happens it's a
28:36 - race so if you've never used homebrew
28:42 - here's what's going on here so if you're
28:45 - on a Mac you can use homebrew to install
28:47 - packages so there are different reasons
28:50 - why you might want to use home homebrew
28:52 - but it can be it can be useful so I just
28:58 - ran brew update which just updated
29:00 - homebrew it's good good there if you
29:04 - don't run homebrew often it's a good
29:06 - idea to just do a brew update every time
29:08 - you're going to install something new
29:09 - and then I'm doing brew install MongoDB
29:11 - so waiting on that looks like it's still
29:16 - saying three minutes left on the
29:18 - Compass something like the the home brew
29:25 - install might might win the race here
29:28 - okay let's see
29:39 - [Music]
29:42 - harsh harsh is saying check out all
29:44 - changes you might have done some
29:46 - breaking change is possible all I really
29:50 - added in were console logs and I think I
29:52 - actually got rid of all those so it
29:55 - should be everything should be exactly
29:58 - the same
29:59 - I can always pull the pull the branch
30:05 - down again
30:22 - sirrah mad
30:36 - okay
30:39 - all right so now we reverted all right
30:44 - so we do have Brian's asking about
30:46 - homebrew so while we're waiting for this
30:48 - to install we may as well talk about
30:50 - number so homebrew helps you it's been a
30:55 - while since I even read anything about
30:57 - homebrew but from what I remember when I
31:01 - was first researching this homebrew who
31:04 - helps you use C you install these
31:09 - packages but you do it in a way that
31:11 - protects your system so I don't know if
31:13 - sandboxing is the right word but I guess
31:20 - it's it's somewhat similar to that also
31:23 - it makes it easier really easy to update
31:25 - things so like if you install yarn
31:28 - through homebrew and you want to update
31:30 - yarn you just run the update through
31:33 - homebrew so there's no sometimes yarn
31:37 - for whatever reason can be tricky at
31:39 - least I've it's been tricky for me
31:41 - probably because on some of my scenes I
31:43 - use homebrew and some of machines I use
31:45 - I installed it other ways so anyway I'm
31:50 - gonna do my 5-minute break now and I'll
31:52 - just continue talking about homebrew for
31:54 - a minute here but it just kind of makes
31:59 - it easy to be able I mean you can see a
32:01 - lot of the packages here that are
32:03 - available
32:06 - this kind of simplifies installing
32:10 - packages you know you don't have to go
32:11 - like read the docs on how to manually
32:13 - install any of these it just it's there
32:15 - and it works so anyway I don't use it
32:20 - for everything but it is convenient for
32:23 - some things all right let me scroll up
32:27 - and see what questions you all have and
32:32 - try to answer as many as I can here in
32:34 - this little break
32:46 - Oh Goo's says I can't learn vanilla
32:50 - JavaScript could you guys help me yeah I
32:57 - would say if you're having trouble with
32:59 - vanilla JavaScript I mean you can
33:00 - certainly ask any questions here in the
33:02 - live chat or you know ask me questions
33:05 - on Twitter or something like that but I
33:09 - think checking out free code camps
33:15 - javascript exercises is a good way to
33:17 - get your hang of get the hang of all the
33:20 - syntax and run through some algorithms
33:22 - and things there are other great
33:24 - resources so code Academy has some nice
33:28 - like in browser tutorials and there's
33:32 - certainly a lot of YouTube videos
33:34 - there's a great JavaScript series here
33:37 - on free code camps channel that that Bo
33:40 - recorded so you know check that out
33:43 - there's also some good open source books
33:46 - so the you don't know J S series is
33:50 - available for free on github that's a
33:52 - great series so there's a lot of
33:54 - different things you could do to learn
33:56 - JavaScript it kind of depends on your
33:58 - preferred learning style I would say for
34:02 - me things I like the videos and I like
34:05 - reading and all that and the in browser
34:08 - exercises but I don't feel like I really
34:10 - get them the concepts and so I start to
34:13 - use it in my own projects and and need
34:15 - to modify things you know based on the
34:17 - project requirements then I find myself
34:20 - really getting the hang of these
34:22 - different concepts so no matter what you
34:24 - do to learn at first I would try to
34:27 - spend some time every day just you know
34:30 - a little bit of time every day actually
34:31 - using those concepts if you can it'll be
34:34 - much easier to keep those learn those
34:37 - concepts and remember them if you do a
34:39 - little bit every day as opposed to you
34:41 - know maybe taking one day a week and
34:43 - spending hours learning so that's that's
34:47 - just kind of some basic advice if you're
34:51 - having issues with a specific part of
34:54 - JavaScript you know that
34:56 - you know or let us know here in the live
34:58 - chat and I mean we could help you with
35:00 - that okay Blake asked about end rock at
35:13 - the beginning and Rock is the the
35:16 - service that I'm using to be able to let
35:20 - you all see on your computer in your
35:23 - browser the projects that I'm working on
35:25 - locally and you can inspect them however
35:29 - it's not really going to be of that much
35:31 - use right now because of the way we have
35:33 - the servers running so we will be using
35:37 - it in the future but for right now it's
35:42 - not it's not really gonna work and it
35:47 - has nothing to do with n grog and rocks
35:49 - working perfectly it's just what we have
35:51 - one on right now with the project
35:54 - Fernando says I'm from Argentina
35:57 - I need a job
36:02 - Fernando let's see if you if you're on
36:07 - Twitter and you wanna if you send me a
36:13 - tweet with I'm sorry if you tagged me in
36:16 - a tweet that maybe has a link to your
36:20 - github repository or your portfolio
36:22 - website and just saying the tweet like
36:25 - you know I'm looking for work this is
36:27 - what I do I'd be happy to retweet you I
36:29 - don't have that many followers I'm like
36:32 - just under 600 right now but maybe some
36:35 - of my followers may retweet as well and
36:37 - some of my followers do have a lot more
36:40 - followers on their account so that may
36:43 - help I don't I don't know of any jobs
36:44 - available right now and I'm not really
36:46 - in a position to make hiring decisions
36:48 - on my own where I'm working right now
36:51 - but I'd be more than happy to just try
36:53 - to get your name out there on Twitter a
36:55 - little bit more so my link to my Twitter
37:01 - account or at least my name on Twitter
37:03 - is is in the description for this video
37:08 - okay
37:19 - all right so that time is up let's do
37:22 - one more session hopefully we can get
37:25 - things something figured out in this
37:27 - session so let me scroll back down and
37:30 - let me grab let's see I have all my
37:34 - database info open on another screen so
37:40 - let me grab this and paste this in here
37:55 - okay all right so now that I have the
37:58 -  shell I'm going to let me get all
38:11 - the all the info in here just to just
38:17 - take me just a second I'm going to I'm
38:20 - going to build the string that I need to
38:22 - put in there on my other screen and then
38:27 - I'll paste it into the terminal
39:17 - okay so I'm not I'm not going to do this
39:21 - on the screen I'm doing some another
39:22 - screen because I have all my database
39:24 - info in here but right now it's it's in
39:29 - the process of connecting so let's see
39:32 - what happens I don't know how long it
39:34 - normally takes to connect
39:48 - okay actually interesting okay so we I
39:56 - did get by an error that gives me a
39:59 - little bit more information here
40:12 - hmm
40:18 - okay so is definitely the problem I
40:23 - think is with connecting to the database
40:25 - let's see oh there's a lot of capital
40:30 - letters in the live chat right now so
40:32 - let's see what har should say okay so
40:36 - harsh is saying that we should run a
40:39 - local database all right so let's do
40:44 - this
40:52 - start dB
41:00 - okay
41:35 - okay all right so we've started MongoDB
41:42 - let's see
41:50 - changing to mondo vocalist bulletin
42:08 - okay
42:24 - all right let's whoops
42:35 - okay so let me let me repeat what's
42:42 - going on in the live chat here sorry I
42:44 - think I've been pretty silent trying to
42:46 - read this so for everybody they can't
42:48 - see the live chat so what we're going to
42:52 - try to do is locally run a database so
42:55 -  DB which we can do now since we
42:58 - installed everything so we're going to
43:03 - start this so we've run on my other
43:05 - screen I guess I could pull this over
43:07 - now because I don't have any special
43:14 - there we go okay so let me the the zoom
43:21 - one i therm is a little odd but anyway
43:27 - alright so I was pasting the wrong stuff
43:29 - in here but basically an R should let me
43:33 - know so I did Bruce services start
43:35 - MongoDB and it started a database and
43:38 - then I mistakenly pasted this in here
43:41 - before I saw your comment about where to
43:43 - put that so let's
43:57 - yeah okay so I've done the brewery
44:01 - services start MongoDB and I'm gonna put
44:08 - I'm going to change the dot n file
44:30 - okay so I've changed the database in the
44:35 - dot M file all right now let's restart
44:41 - the server whoops
44:42 - I have it here
44:45 - oh no sorry start this up rates alright
44:59 - as soon as this refreshes we'll test it
45:00 - out
45:09 - okay I'm seeing some hopeful things in
45:12 - the console yes I hate okay so it says
45:18 - the email has been sent
45:19 - let me verify that I have my email upon
45:23 - on the other screen and yes okay I have
45:26 - the token and let me grab this token and
45:32 - we'll paste it in over here so everyone
45:34 - can see awesome
45:40 - all right really cool so let me recap
45:44 - just I guess I didn't need to zoom in
45:49 - that much but let's recap would just
45:52 - happen
45:53 - so our it seems that our whole problem
45:55 - for the last or at least not not our
45:58 - problem it works your Harshit right away
46:00 - but for me for some reason and possibly
46:03 - this has to do with with my network here
46:05 - although I did try it on another network
46:08 - so maybe it's not I'm not sure what the
46:10 - issue is but for whatever reason we
46:16 - couldn't connect to the database that I
46:18 - was trying to run through a service
46:19 - called M lab so instead we installed
46:24 -  with homebrew and then we just
46:28 - started up locally a database then I
46:32 - replace the local database in our DB
46:37 - hosts and our dot M file and that's the
46:40 - dot n files where you put information
46:42 - that you want to pull in as variables
46:44 - but you want to keep that secret so you
46:46 - don't put the dot end file in your
46:48 - github repo and nobody ever sees that
46:51 - okay get it it allows you to pull that
46:54 - into your source code but it remains
46:58 - hidden and you can still have things in
47:01 - your repository on github and you don't
47:05 - have to risk exposing API keys or
47:09 - passwords or anything like that so
47:11 - anyway so we changed our den file and
47:14 - then we're able to connect to the
47:15 - database so the authorization works as
47:21 - stated and you know exactly how how it
47:25 - was supposed to work so thanks harsh it
47:26 - great job on that so awesome
47:33 - well this is awesome so what I wanted
47:37 - let's let's test some of this out right
47:42 - great so you see we were able to log in
47:45 - let's check out let's check out where
47:49 - this is being stored at you have this on
47:54 - local storage or in cookies
48:19 - cool
48:21 - all right so okay heart should say we
48:28 - should test the form submission - that's
48:30 - a good idea so the form submission was
48:33 - working before let's test it again just
48:35 - to make sure I'm just gonna put some
48:38 - things in here and submit all right
48:41 - submitted let's double check my email
48:45 - yep I got it
48:47 - actually let's try to do that with a
48:49 - file as well so let's see let's send so
49:03 - I'm gonna send something okay this is
49:08 - reasonably thin this is something that a
49:11 - PDF is something something we'll
49:13 - probably get sent frequently so all
49:18 - right and
49:33 - okay cool when the attachment did come
49:35 - through great
49:47 - awesome okay okay so all that works all
49:55 - right so we may as well merge this now
49:58 - so let's go back to our our console and
50:03 - what I'm gonna do first and I always do
50:07 - this always do this when I have branches
50:13 - that I'm merging is first we're going to
50:15 - merge master into our other branch and
50:19 - then if something really goes wrong at
50:21 - least we haven't messed up our master
50:23 - branch right so let's do get merge
50:29 - master all right why are you up to date
50:32 - I actually merged beforehand so I was
50:35 - almost positive that was going to work
50:37 - sometimes you may have merged conflicts
50:40 - in this case there was there was nothing
50:42 - harsh it does a good job of keeping
50:44 - everything merged so anyway let's go
50:49 - let's do a git checkout master up master
50:57 - and now we'll get merge h off great okay
51:05 - let me just double check we should be
51:07 - all up to date with our packages but
51:09 - never hurts to run it again great we are
51:13 - up to date and now we'll do a git push
51:15 - origin master all right that's going to
51:18 - push our code up to github and then if
51:20 - anybody happens to be looking at this
51:21 - pull request it will change from open to
51:24 - merge whenever we do this so we don't
51:26 - even have to do anything in github right
51:31 - from the command line it's it's going to
51:32 - be taken care of all right great
51:39 - okay now here's the thing though we
51:47 - there's some things that will probably
51:50 - change just so that we can all work on
51:53 - this and test it out so for instance
51:55 - right now you have to put in a
51:56 - Franciscan University email address
52:00 - now granted you could have it sent to
52:03 - mail trap so like there are ways but I
52:06 - think it's it's probably a good idea to
52:09 - make some changes hopefully I can get
52:11 - those changes done today probably not
52:12 - doing the stream just to make it
52:15 - possible I guess to skip the login since
52:21 - we know it works basically so y'all can
52:23 - get in and you're locally on your
52:26 - machines and do you know check out other
52:28 - things and do other type of work so
52:30 - we'll see about that so for now just be
52:33 - aware that it's going to make you log in
52:35 - now if you try to download this okay so
52:41 - let me bring over I guess I don't have
52:45 - to bring over I just want to grab one
52:52 - more pull request and that's the last
52:57 - one that we currently have open which it
52:59 - feels really good to get all these pull
53:00 - requests taken care of I've been so
53:02 - behind on getting things merged and
53:04 - really it was it was this request that
53:07 - we just sorted out now that was making
53:09 - me fall behind the most I just kept
53:14 - trying to troubleshoot and didn't
53:16 - realize until we're there today that it
53:17 - was most likely a database thing okay so
53:23 - let's grab this poor request 47 and this
53:29 - is where har should implemented the
53:30 - masonry layout if you're not familiar
53:32 - with that it with what that is hopefully
53:34 - you'll see an example in just a minute
53:36 - so let's do a git fetch origin pool 47
53:44 - since it's pool requests 47 Ted and then
53:48 - we'll call this H masonry all right
53:53 - you don't have to name it H masonry you
53:56 - can name it whatever you want but I kind
53:59 - of like to put the first letter of the
54:02 - name of the person who's doing the pool
54:04 - request and then it just helps me keep
54:06 - straight who who did what and it helps
54:09 - me to be able to remember and give
54:11 - credit to the
54:12 - a person for doing this pool request so
54:15 - now let's check out let's do a get check
54:17 - out that new branch that we just created
54:19 - masonry and now whoops I keep forgetting
54:25 - I have the have a sent another screen
54:29 - recognized for your component oops I got
54:31 - to do a yarn it's a good idea to just
54:38 - run yarn all the time when you're
54:40 - pulling that down because if you don't
54:41 - need it it won't hurt anything but if
54:44 - you do need it it'll prevent you from
54:46 - maybe trying to troubleshoot something
54:49 - that you really shouldn't have to worry
54:52 - about because it should have been all
54:54 - taken care of
54:55 - oops let's try to restart before we do
55:08 - anything else
55:23 - okay great this is another thing that I
55:26 - found just from experience when you
55:29 - update when you switch to a new branch
55:31 - and you run yarn sometimes it's a good
55:34 - idea just to restart your server I know
55:37 - I've been very frustrated for a minute
55:39 - when things don't work and then luckily
55:42 - just a restart has been able to fix
55:45 - everything so try to do those two things
55:47 - run yarn or run NPM install and then
55:49 - restart the server before you try to
55:51 - troubleshoot anything it could save you
55:53 - a lot of time I know I've wasted a lot
55:55 - of time when I've forgotten to do that
55:58 - okay so anyway here's what we're talking
56:01 - about with masonry layout check that out
56:04 - that's just that looks cool write that
56:09 - all the cards just kind of flow so we
56:13 - had we talked about CSS grid so maybe it
56:16 - would be a good idea to explain the
56:17 - differences between what's going on here
56:19 - and CSS grid because certainly CSS grid
56:23 - is much more simple to to implement but
56:30 - what we had when we had the the grid was
56:35 - first initially when we implemented the
56:38 - grid we had these big gaps so we would
56:41 - have you know one two three and then our
56:43 - second row of three wouldn't start till
56:45 - here so it looked okay for these cards
56:48 - but then for this card there is this big
56:50 - white space then Harshit was able to set
56:53 - a uniform height for these and that got
56:58 - rid of our gaps but then on cards like
57:01 - this we would have a huge white space
57:03 - within the card so what what masonry
57:13 - does and behind the scenes what's going
57:16 - on here is using some JavaScript to
57:19 - position these so this is not CSS
57:22 - positioning each one of these actually
57:24 - has a position I mean I can you can
57:27 - actually see it happening in the console
57:31 - let's see
57:34 - maybe try to get to the right spot here
57:38 - and okay I guess the the first card is
57:48 - not really that useful to look at
57:50 - because all right so let me let me make
57:54 - this a bit bigger see all can can see it
57:56 - and then it'll be it'll be really
57:59 - obvious what's going on behind the
58:00 - scenes in just a second so let's bring
58:04 - this over I'm looking right here at this
58:08 - this positioning so it's absolute
58:10 - position right now it's left four
58:13 - hundred and some four and twenty six
58:14 - pixels top zero so as we move you can
58:21 - see the pixels changing so that's three
58:26 - eighteen three fifty so and now we have
58:30 - our top change so the absolute
58:34 - positioning is constantly changing based
58:37 - on the screen the screen size so that's
58:42 - that's the difference there is the CSS
58:46 - grid of course is CSS based positioning
58:48 - and this is certainly it uses CSS right
58:52 - which we're saying position:absolute
58:53 - left top those are CSS attributes but
58:59 - javascript is directly controlling those
59:01 - so anyway that's how you deal with
59:06 - masonry masonry can be a pain at times I
59:09 - know in previous projects we had
59:14 - implemented this with react before and
59:19 - it took a while to get that that was
59:20 - with project one it took it took a
59:22 - little while to get it working and I've
59:25 - tried to implement this with with some
59:27 - jQuery stuff before it's definitely it
59:30 - can be a pain at times especially if you
59:31 - have images to get the positioning
59:34 - correct you you need to be able to have
59:38 - everything get repositioned whenever the
59:40 - image is actually load there's a helper
59:42 - library for that as well but there's a
59:44 - lot of different things that could go
59:48 - when you're using this but I think the
59:49 - end result is is worth it and there's
59:54 - cool things you could do with this like
59:56 - like filtering to you know have things
60:00 - just switch around you know on the fly
60:04 - it looks nice there's different types of
60:08 - transitions that you could use so this
60:11 - there's different options so anyway
60:14 - really nice great work on that hard
60:17 - I really like that
60:19 - and you can see you know our ListView is
60:21 - still just regular ListView but when we
60:25 - go back to grid view much nicer so great
60:30 - that's great job and we should have the
60:32 - same thing here when we go to our
60:34 - categories as well right now we don't
60:38 - really have enough posts to be able to
60:39 - see you know the full grid in action
60:41 - here but very nice okay
60:46 - let me check my time all right so this
60:48 - I'm almost done with this 25 minutes so
60:50 - I'm just going to go into the live chat
60:52 - now and answer some of your questions so
60:54 - basically we've achieved what we met
60:56 - what we wanted to achieve we've
60:59 - successfully troubleshooted what was
61:01 - wrong with our auth and with our log in
61:05 - system and the problem ended up being
61:07 - just for some reason I can't connect to
61:10 - a remote database so we had to run it
61:13 - locally so everything seems to be
61:16 - working with that we're able to get this
61:19 - grid layout in and I guess we could
61:22 - merge that in right now as well since I
61:24 - have a minute left it'll only take a
61:26 - minute to merge so let's go ahead and
61:29 - and merge that while we're here so first
61:32 - let's do a git merge master all right we
61:39 - have a conflict all right this is cool
61:40 - I'm really glad we had a conflict ok
61:44 - hard saying to try the logout ok cool
61:47 - off shar the logout let me finish this
61:49 - merge and then we'll try that ok
61:55 - Harshit also wants to make sure that
61:57 - that it is known that
61:59 - to use materialized for masonry yeah I
62:01 - did see that that comment in your pool
62:04 - request so how should saying is a real
62:07 - pain yeah I do I appreciate all the work
62:10 - I mean I I know I've I've had a lot of
62:15 - pain in dealing with this as well both
62:17 - with react and with without react with
62:21 - with some javis a query based single
62:25 - page apps that I made before before I
62:28 - started streaming so I definitely
62:31 - appreciate all the work that went into
62:34 - that
62:35 - so let's um let's see oops
62:44 - trying to find oh here we go alright
62:47 - where's their merge conflict that it was
62:48 - in that CSS file was it not okay alright
62:53 - cool so here if you've never seen a
62:56 - conflict emerge conflict it can look
63:01 - different depending on what editor
63:03 - you're using but basically you're gonna
63:06 - have sections from each and then you're
63:10 - gonna have a section where it gets kind
63:12 - of telling you here's what we think it
63:14 - should look like and so you get to
63:17 - choose what you want so let's check out
63:19 - what's going on here so our head is
63:24 - going to be our current branch so our
63:26 - current branch is that masonry branch
63:31 - so whatever branch your own is the head
63:32 - and then our other branches our master
63:36 - branch so that's what we have currently
63:38 - on a master branch so probably what we
63:41 - want to do is keep whatever's in the
63:46 - master branch so yeah we don't want all
63:54 - this stuff so what we're gonna do then
63:55 - is use master ok so you won't always
64:03 - have that option it does depend on what
64:05 - you're doing with your or what kind of
64:07 - editor you're using my packages that you
64:09 - have so you may have to manually
64:12 - get rid of manually delete that but in
64:14 - this case we can just click use me and
64:16 - it handles it for us which is nice so
64:18 - now we have this padding right important
64:21 - I do believe we want to keep that but
64:24 - let's see oh no we do we need that we
64:33 - have it on body let me double check so
64:36 - let's double check in I guess I can just
64:40 - run this on the on my other screen let
64:47 - me double check quickly what we have
64:49 - here yes
64:54 - oops I need index that's CSS okay we are
65:03 - gonna keep that we are gonna keep this
65:11 - right let me check the live chat quickly
65:13 - Sebastian will know more than anyone
65:15 - whether or not we need to keep this so
65:17 - Sebastian if you're still with us in the
65:20 - live chat let me know I mean this is not
65:24 - really a big deal this is not hard to go
65:27 - back in and change this let's see we'll
65:35 - just we'll keep this in for now if we
65:37 - notice that something weird is happening
65:38 - with it we can always take it out but
65:40 - anyway now I've saved that and we can
65:46 - see if we go back in here we're gonna
65:54 - commit so let me double check and make
65:57 - sure ok was just with index it'll tell
66:00 - you what files have have conflicts so
66:02 - since it was just indexed on CSS we fix
66:05 - those conflicts let's go in here and get
66:09 - commit I'm gonna do a git commit I'm
66:12 - gonna put the commit message right in
66:15 - line here and say
66:37 - okay it's running our tests great okay
66:42 - awesome so the merge has worked
66:44 - now let's well let's quickly just double
66:48 - check and make sure everything's working
66:49 - I don't really have any reason to think
66:53 - that it wouldn't work but worth a shot
66:58 - and then we can also test out our logout
67:01 - as well all right looks good looks good
67:12 - great what else did we have this bad all
67:18 - right wonderful
67:20 - all right let's test our logout okay
67:24 - great we're able to log out and we'll
67:28 - just test a login great that was nice
67:30 - and quick we have our our token here and
67:40 - awesome loves us right back in wonderful
67:45 - okay now let's do get checkout master
67:49 - and we'll do a git merge H mace H
67:57 - masonry awesome now we have the masonry
68:03 - branch here and we can do a git master
68:11 - awesome so now everything should be
68:14 - up-to-date we'll have all our pull
68:16 - requests merge for the bulletins react
68:19 - wonderful okay we do still have we have
68:23 - one issue open and there's certainly
68:26 - more that needs to be done so maybe I'll
68:28 - try to add some more issues in here so
68:32 - if anybody would like to work on them
68:34 - you can work on them if anybody needs to
68:38 - get those last few pull requests in
68:40 - before for hack tober fast to get your
68:43 - t-shirt maybe I'll try to put in some
68:46 - some some of them are going to be more
68:48 - difficult some of the issues
68:49 - maybe you'll try to put in some easy
68:51 - ones if anybody's kind of new to coding
68:54 - but still wants to get the pull requests
68:57 - in also I still don't have all my pull
69:01 - requests in so if anybody has a project
69:03 - that you need some help with and would
69:05 - like me to open a pull request for your
69:07 - project let me know send me a link to
69:11 - your repository and let me know what
69:17 - need what you need work on so now that
69:20 - I've finished my class I may have a
69:23 - little extra time to work on stuff like
69:26 - that so I probably won't be able to like
69:30 - do anything really significant but you
69:35 - all helped me out so much it'd be cool
69:38 - if I could help you out with something
69:39 - as well all right so let me go through
69:45 - the live chat now and that'll be the
69:51 - last thing that we do let's see so if
70:00 - you have any questions please put them
70:03 - in the live chat now I'll do my best to
70:05 - answer all the questions if you don't
70:07 - have a question please consider sticking
70:09 - around and helping to answer some of the
70:10 - questions I'd love to have your
70:11 - expertise to help give the best answers
70:15 - we can to everybody that's that's asking
70:17 - questions but if you can't stick around
70:22 - you can always catch the Q&A session
70:26 - later in the recording and please join
70:29 - us again tomorrow should be around the
70:31 - same time today was a little later than
70:34 - normal but I like to stream around 2
70:36 - p.m. Eastern Time we may will probably
70:42 - end up working on some UI stuff tomorrow
70:43 - I haven't decided for sure but maybe
70:49 - we'll work on some of that we've had
70:51 - some heavy back-end stuff lately so it
70:54 - might be nice to switch it up do some
70:57 - some front end you know CSS work so but
71:02 - let me know if anybody
71:03 - as anything specifically they'd really
71:05 - like me to go over tomorrow let me know
71:07 - in the live chat right now or send me a
71:09 - message on Twitter and if if it's doable
71:12 - within the scope of the project I'd be
71:14 - more than happy to to steer the stream
71:17 - in that direction okay let me find where
71:21 - I left off
71:22 - there we are
71:25 - oh you know before I forget yesterday I
71:33 - had I think it was harsh it asked about
71:37 - freelancing and then I had someone on
71:38 - Twitter as well asked about freelancing
71:40 - so we'll see how much time the
71:43 - question/answer takes maybe I'll talk
71:45 - about it now but I've been thinking
71:46 - maybe I should do a video a short video
71:49 - and put it on my own YouTube channel
71:51 - about my experience as a freelancer and
71:53 - my advice to anybody that wants to be a
71:56 - freelance web developer so if you think
71:59 - you might be interested in that let me
72:01 - know if nobody's really interested maybe
72:03 - I won't take the time to do it but
72:05 - otherwise if you think it might be
72:07 - helpful for you I did freelance I was a
72:10 - freelance web developer for three years
72:12 - so and I still do freelancing on the
72:15 - side so I'm certainly not the best there
72:19 - is but I have a lot of you know
72:22 - experience about five years of
72:24 - experience so that at least I could give
72:28 - you some advice over the areas where I
72:30 - made mistakes in some of the areas where
72:32 - I was successful
72:58 - all right still I'm scrolling down
73:00 - looking for questions a lot of this
73:02 - section of live chat I was interacting a
73:05 - lot during the the coding so things that
73:09 - we've already talked about I'm just kind
73:11 - of skipping it over okay actually Rohan
73:19 - has a good comment here so previously we
73:23 - were talking about homebrew and I was
73:28 - trying to explain a little bit about
73:29 - what it does but I like what Rohan says
73:32 - here he says homebrew is a package
73:34 - manager for apps for mac just like NPM
73:39 - is for node packages so on Linux you
73:43 - would have apps and YUM so if you think
73:50 - of it like that I think that's
73:51 - definitely on the right track that'll
73:53 - make it easier if you've never done
73:55 - anything with homebrew basically the
73:58 - same thing does a very similar thing and
74:01 - then what is
74:02 - I forget the one that's for PHP but PHP
74:04 - has something similar
74:22 - okay rook asks if there's a Windows
74:25 - counterpart for homebrew Rowan says it's
74:29 - chocolaty okay that's awesome
74:31 - I've actually didn't know that I haven't
74:33 - really done anything on Windows for a
74:35 - few years now but when I did a lot of
74:39 - development on Windows I had no idea so
74:41 - that's that's awesome so for everyone on
74:44 - a Mac check out homebrew for as a
74:46 - package manager but if you're on a
74:47 - Windows machine check out chocolaty hug
74:54 - harsh it reminded me that my timer was
74:57 - not visible so sorry about that
74:59 - I always forget I just I gotta get used
75:02 - to putting it somewhere else I'm seeing
75:10 - all the horseshit trying to get my
75:13 - attention typing in in all caps so sorry
75:16 - for all the stress that my inattention
75:20 - cost you there I appreciate you being
75:22 - persistent in trying to get my attention
75:24 - though
76:07 - okay earlier I was checking I think I
76:11 - was checking on a different screen but I
76:13 - was mentioning local storage and cookies
76:17 - so I wanted to know where the where the
76:21 - login information was being stored so if
76:23 - you didn't if you didn't catch that I
76:26 - was able to log in on this tab and then
76:31 - this tab was still on the login screen
76:33 - and I just refreshed I was automatically
76:35 - logged in basically there's a cookie
76:41 - stored now currently the the live
76:44 - version of this that's a non react very
76:47 - uses local storage to accomplish the
76:50 - same thing basically to store user data
76:52 - so that the login session can persist so
76:58 - as long as you don't log out or clear
77:00 - your cookies then it should persist so
77:03 - actually not sure is if anyone has any
77:06 - opinion on which is better to use
77:07 - cookies or to use local storage let me
77:10 - know I'd be interested to see if there's
77:14 - if there's some good reason to use one
77:16 - or the other I know I believe cookies
77:21 - that have to be smaller so you have the
77:23 - opportunity to store more in local
77:25 - storage in this case we're not really
77:27 - storing that much so it shouldn't be an
77:29 - issue but if anyone's work with that or
77:32 - has any opinion on that please let me
77:35 - know
77:58 - okay Harshit earlier i was talking about
78:02 - how there might be an issue for for
78:05 - someone else to log in and Harshit said
78:07 - i i was setting up said you said that
78:11 - you need the franciscan needy you
78:13 - off-guard i simply implemented it yeah
78:18 - yeah don't worry i'm not upset that you
78:20 - implemented it i'm actually really glad
78:22 - that you did that because that's exactly
78:25 - what we need for when this goes live I
78:28 - was just trying to think of an easy way
78:30 - for other people to be able to
78:32 - contribute to the project maybe without
78:35 - having to set up a database and
78:37 - everything because I still want this to
78:39 - be as beginner-friendly as possible you
78:42 - know there's some there's some little
78:44 - things that people who are new could
78:45 - could contribute to the project but they
78:49 - may not be able to figure out I mean I
78:51 - did a whole database thing I needed your
78:54 - help to figure that out as well so I
78:56 - just wanted to try to think of some way
78:58 - to make it a bit easier so I'm thinking
79:00 - maybe maybe I could put something into
79:04 - where it checks whether it's in
79:05 - development mode or production and if
79:07 - it's in dev mode we just disabled the
79:09 - log in and then if it's in production
79:12 - then then it is enabled and then that
79:18 - might be the better way so we'll
79:20 - definitely still want to enable it and
79:22 - test it before we go live with it but
79:25 - when we're doing like UI work and things
79:28 - maybe we can just just disable that I
79:33 - know it's a tional II it's a pain like
79:36 - on the live version if I want to use I
79:40 - have authentication enabled all the time
79:43 - even if I'm running it locally and it's
79:46 - tough if I use like browser stack to
79:49 - test the browsers and browsers that
79:51 - don't have my local storage data so I
79:56 - have to log in I have another email sent
79:59 - and log in again on every different
80:01 - machine I want to be on if I want to
80:03 - test it on a phone or something like
80:05 - that so I end up having to log in quite
80:08 - a bit so it
80:12 - be cool if we came up with a simple way
80:14 - to disable the login for testing
80:17 - purposes so anyway I just don't want you
80:21 - to think that that was wrong to
80:24 - implement that that was perfect that was
80:25 - exactly what I wanted
80:38 - okay rooks asking what all those
80:40 - warnings actually mean the incorrect
80:42 - peer dependency yeah let's check that
80:44 - out but look at all these things all
80:49 - right let me read down and see if
80:50 - anybody else said anything
80:59 - and see
81:04 - okay I don't it looks like dragon hunter
81:07 - said I can RM RF node modules and then
81:10 - run yarn so would that get rid of this
81:14 - I'll try that out okay so actually this
81:19 - would be cool to run so if you end up
81:20 - having weird problems with your node
81:22 - modules I have done this in the past and
81:25 - it has fixed some of my problems
81:26 - it doesn't always but occasionally
81:28 - basically this is like completely wiping
81:31 - out all your node modules and
81:32 - reinstalling everything and starting
81:34 - from scratch let's do it it's not gonna
81:36 - hurt the project it's just going to take
81:38 - a couple minutes to get everything back
81:39 - but what you're using so we're going to
81:43 - use this RM RF oops RF do not use this
81:48 - unless you're really sure because what
81:50 - this is going to do RM is just remove
81:53 - right but this is gonna remove
81:55 - everything in a folder so all subfolders
81:59 - all files everything so only use this if
82:04 - you're really sure that you want
82:06 - everything to be gone alright this stuff
82:08 - does not go in the recycle bin this is
82:10 - gone like forever gone so having said
82:15 - that I know that I'm okay with my node
82:19 - modules being gone I've done this you
82:21 - know plenty of times so our node modules
82:25 - and when we when I run this everything's
82:28 - going to be gone and our node modules
82:29 - folder is gonna be gone so let's go CD
82:41 - right I can't I can't even get to that
82:44 - that that doesn't exist okay our node
82:46 - module so now we're gonna run yarn and
82:50 - know we're still getting the same errors
82:52 - okay so I guess I didn't fix it it's in
82:56 - Korea dependency hmm I don't really know
83:00 - what the issue is maybe if I updated all
83:03 - of our packages it might work I'm a
83:05 - hesitant to do that right now because
83:08 - but sometimes when you upgrade packages
83:11 - they break something if they're breaking
83:12 - changes within the packages so I'd
83:16 - rather not do that
83:18 - at the end of the day the end of a
83:19 - workday hum but let's just double-check
83:25 - everything still works it should work so
83:28 - let's refresh alright great still works
83:33 - see all right let's go back to the live
83:38 - chat
83:39 - oh cool dragon hunter says actually that
83:46 - grid is neat so a good job yeah
83:47 - definitely good job harsh it really like
83:50 - that
83:58 - okay rook said I just got an email from
84:00 - Codecademy that they teach grid now on
84:03 - their CSS court course doing that later
84:06 - get course first awesome yeah that
84:09 - that's the CSS grid is really good for a
84:14 - lot of things this is probably one of
84:15 - the very few use cases that I would want
84:18 - to go with something else just for this
84:19 - in particular CSS is it's good it's
84:25 - great it's always getting better but
84:27 - there's still no easy way to do
84:30 - something like this with CSS and be able
84:35 - to have as much control over layout as
84:38 - you could you know we're doing this with
84:41 - JavaScript
84:53 - okay John Hanson says grid so CSS grid
84:57 - has grid Auto flow row column row dense
85:02 - column dense which gives very tight fit
85:04 - and you can set min max on the rows and
85:06 - columns cool actually I would love to
85:10 - see an example of some something like
85:13 - this done with CSS grid if it's possible
85:17 - to do something that that truly looks
85:19 - like this if there's a pure CSS way to
85:23 - do it I'm I'm definitely open to it
85:35 - so I'm not aware at least the last time
85:38 - I tried to implement something like this
85:40 - which is normal CSS as far as I could
85:44 - tell with with researching it there was
85:46 - not a way to get this exact layout but
85:52 - maybe maybe something's happened since
85:53 - then with with CSS grid that allows it
86:16 - Blake says my droid is isn't displaying
86:19 - all my categories actually if you like
86:24 - if you're having trouble with with some
86:27 - of your files send me send me a link to
86:30 - your repo let me know what's going on I
86:33 - can take a look at it if you want me to
86:39 - harsh it says so so you now like
86:42 - password this NPM module I I don't have
86:47 - an opinion about it yet because I've
86:50 - only worked with it in terms of just
86:52 - reading the documentation to be able to
86:54 - understand what you did and try to
86:57 - troubleshoot so I don't know that I've
86:59 - used it enough to reasonably have an
87:02 - opinion about it but it's definitely
87:04 - working to do what we wanted to do in
87:08 - terms of the password let's login so I
87:09 - do like the results
87:19 - Harshit says will I get a t-shirt this
87:23 - as I have 20 PRS yeah I'm for sure you
87:26 - have you have enough full requests just
87:28 - on this project alone I mean I'm
87:31 - assuming you did sign up for hack tober
87:33 - fest so assuming you signed up you'll
87:36 - definitely get to keep this shirt
88:01 - okay so on Hanson saying so in react to
88:05 - change state on an imported component on
88:08 - click go up the Dom to retrieve a key
88:11 - value then uses that key to array dot
88:16 - fine using the key to locate it and pull
88:20 - in the data I'm not sure I'm not really
88:29 - sure how that works behind the scenes so
88:31 - I'm not I don't know that I could
88:34 - comment enough on the mechanics of what
88:37 - is happening behind the scenes within
88:38 - react okay cool it looks like a few of
88:43 - you are interested in freelancing advice
89:08 - oh cool thanks Harsha I mentioned
89:11 - there's a package manager for PHP but I
89:13 - couldn't remember it was its composer
89:15 - all right that makes sense I am I was
89:18 - thinking it started with like a calm I
89:21 - was thinking compass but I knew it was
89:22 - and I was just thinking that because we
89:24 - used something called compass earlier at
89:28 - least we're going to use it so awesome
89:30 - it's called composer for PHP so for any
89:32 - p8 I know we have some PHP people that
89:34 - watch the stream so if you haven't
89:37 - already used a check out composer as a
89:39 - package manager for PHP oh cool and
89:43 - Zuber mentions that rails have gem so
89:47 - gems the package manager and for dotnet
89:49 - the package manager is nugget awesome
89:56 - thanks for that Zuber I don't know that
89:59 - I've seen you that much in the live chat
90:01 - commenting so I don't know if if you're
90:03 - new here to the chat are you just
90:06 - usually not able to comment in the live
90:09 - chat that frequently but anyway welcome
90:11 - and thanks for contributing okay in ass
90:21 - where do you find customers for
90:23 - freelance projects okay cool I'll answer
90:27 - like I said I think I'm going to do a
90:28 - video and in going more depth into this
90:31 - but I'll definitely answer this about
90:33 - freelancing right now so the questions
90:37 - where do you find customers for
90:40 - freelance projects so I'm just going to
90:43 - speak from my experience and and maybe
90:45 - try to give some advice some more
90:47 - general advice but for me I'll tell you
90:52 - I'll tell you what didn't work so I got
90:56 - I think I got one customer through my
91:02 - website through the contact form on my
91:04 - website only one ever now I'm sure that
91:10 - my website helped because people could
91:13 - go there first and check me out or you
91:16 - know whatever it probably did help but
91:20 - the contact form on my
91:22 - it was not really that useful I did sign
91:27 - up for several different freelancing
91:31 - sites so I think I did just call it
91:35 - freelancer maybe it was called
91:37 - freelancer so I did that one I did she
91:41 - was the other one they still send me
91:43 - messages all the time no I can't
91:48 - remember what it was okay so I basically
91:50 - did one where they send you potential
91:54 - customers and you can bid on the project
91:57 - so basically you have to buy like tokens
91:59 - to be able to bid on it I only got one
92:02 - customer from that and it was a really
92:04 - small customer I don't think I made more
92:06 - than $100 off of working with that
92:09 - customer so that wasn't great the same
92:14 - thing with the freelance website I
92:16 - didn't really have a great experience it
92:19 - seems like you have to to get projects
92:22 - you just have to undercut everybody else
92:24 - in terms of price so low that it's it's
92:27 - basically like working for free it takes
92:30 - a lot of work to get enough reputation
92:32 - on those things
92:33 - so I don't personally recommend that
92:36 - unless you really have nowhere else to
92:37 - go and you just want to get some work
92:39 - for your portfolio then you know go
92:43 - ahead and go to those freelance websites
92:44 - what works for me the most was personal
92:51 - connections and I know when I heard this
92:56 - when I was starting out freelancing I
92:58 - always I didn't want to hear that right
93:00 - because I want to just be able to sit at
93:03 - my computer and code and get customers
93:05 - but that's not really how it how it
93:07 - works freelancing is about selling
93:10 - yourself just as much as it's about
93:11 - coding so you have to be willing to talk
93:18 - to people and let them know what you do
93:19 - and you know be able to show them some
93:23 - of your projects basically to talk about
93:25 - how great you are and how great work you
93:28 - have so if you're not comfortable with
93:30 - that I would rethink freelancing or at
93:32 - least think of a different
93:34 - so here's what I did starting out that
93:36 - really helped me I found someone who was
93:40 - willing to do the work to find customers
93:42 - and then they would give me the projects
93:47 - to work on but they needed a go-between
93:49 - between the customer and between me so I
93:51 - didn't have to handle contracts I didn't
93:54 - have to go to meetings with a customer
93:55 - I rarely had to speak on the phone with
93:58 - customers or email with them this person
94:01 - did all the work now the downside of
94:02 - that is that I made a lot less than I
94:05 - could have if I had done everything but
94:08 - it was nice because I got to focus all
94:10 - my energy on my time on just doing the
94:13 - work doing the coding so I was able to
94:15 - learn a lot more than I otherwise would
94:17 - have if I had to handle everything now
94:20 - through that I was able to build up my
94:22 - portfolio and focus on the coding and
94:26 - then I was able little by little to get
94:30 - some clients so at first maybe it was
94:32 - through family connections I just let my
94:35 - people in my family know you know aunts
94:37 - uncles cousins you know hey I'm working
94:39 - on this and then they would mention it
94:42 - to people that they knew so I got some
94:45 - work from that didn't make a ton of
94:47 - money off of it but I was still trying
94:49 - to build my portfolio I was able to
94:53 - through social media let people know
94:56 - what I was doing so I reached an even
94:59 - bigger audience of people that I still
95:01 - knew in real life and his friends with
95:03 - but then they could bring me connections
95:06 - so I had some of my best clients came
95:09 - from a connection of someone who was a
95:11 - former student of mine when I used to
95:13 - teach high school their boyfriend needed
95:16 - a website and then I did a website for
95:21 - their boyfriend their boyfriend's one of
95:23 - his best friends needed a website for
95:25 - their company saw what I did and then
95:28 - wanted me to work on their websites so I
95:30 - ended up getting into the New York City
95:32 - market through them even though I live
95:36 - far away from from New York City then
95:40 - through them the CEO of that company his
95:45 - his mom and
95:47 - dad runs several other companies in New
95:50 - York and I was able to do websites for
95:53 - them that ended up being one of my best
95:55 - clients I made the most money off of it
95:57 - was very very nice working relationship
96:02 - steady income the biggest client I ever
96:06 - had in terms of money I got because
96:11 - through social media
96:13 - someone who my wife went to college with
96:16 - worked for a company and her father was
96:19 - the CEO of the company found out through
96:23 - my wife that I did websites because she
96:27 - had just asked on social media hey does
96:29 - anybody know anything about websites my
96:31 - wife is able to say yeah got a client
96:33 - from that that was when I did that
96:35 - website and finally finished it and got
96:38 - paid that increased my income by 25%
96:44 - that year just from that one website so
96:47 - basically my point is my best clients
96:52 - came from personal connections sometimes
96:56 - I didn't actually know the people but
96:57 - people I knew knew those people so like
97:02 - I said maybe you might be comfortable
97:03 - this maybe you won't but what you really
97:05 - should be doing if you want to make
97:07 - freelancing work is talking about what
97:11 - you do to the people around you you
97:13 - don't have to be annoying about it you
97:15 - don't have to only talk about that but
97:16 - make sure that everybody on social media
97:19 - knows who you are and what you can do
97:21 - make sure that all your friends and
97:24 - family know what you can do and that's
97:28 - going to be your best clients if you
97:29 - want to advertise otherwise so I did
97:31 - paid ads on on Facebook on Twitter on
97:34 - LinkedIn Google Ads
97:37 - I did all those different ads I did not
97:42 - get customers from those ads was it was
97:46 - a good experience I learned how to use
97:49 - all this products and be able to advise
97:51 - clients on on how to use them search
97:54 - engine optimization it helped to get my
97:57 - website up to you know the
97:58 - first page of Google near the top for my
98:00 - local area but my best clients weren't
98:04 - from the local area anyway so that
98:06 - really wasn't it wasn't a big deal so
98:08 - all those things are good because
98:10 - clients will expect you to have them
98:12 - they'll expect you to have good SEO
98:13 - they'll expect you to have you know a
98:16 - good presence on social media and stuff
98:17 - and if you don't have that they might
98:19 - start to doubt well like does this
98:21 - person really know what they're doing
98:22 - they can't even manage their own website
98:24 - and brand so you have to do those things
98:27 - but don't expect that those things are
98:29 - going to bring you in a ton of clients
98:31 - maybe if you were well-known enough at
98:33 - some point it would help but at first
98:35 - personal connections are where it's at
98:37 - so I went on for a long time about that
98:40 - sorry but it's really important the
98:44 - other option that you have I mentioned I
98:46 - found someone who is willing to be the
98:48 - go-between between the clients and I
98:51 - there are services that do that as well
98:54 - if you can't find a personal connection
98:56 - that would want to do that for you so
98:59 - top towel is an organization that you
99:02 - you take a series of tests so that they
99:05 - know that you're a good developer and
99:06 - then they set you up with clients they
99:09 - handle all the contracts with clients
99:11 - they're the ones that pay you directly
99:13 - the clients don't pay you directly so it
99:17 - cuts down on a lot of that stuff that is
99:20 - not always easy to deal with right if
99:23 - you I've had situations where clients
99:25 - didn't pay me when they were supposed to
99:26 - pay me and it can be a mess and it
99:28 - really is stressful when you're counting
99:30 - on income for your family and you know a
99:34 - company is not paying you so that's a
99:37 - tough situation that's another thing I
99:39 - do recommend always always have a
99:41 - contract I I worked without contracts
99:44 - for a long time and I never had problems
99:45 - and I thought it was fine until somebody
99:48 - decided not to pay me and after that I
99:51 - never did work without a contract so you
99:55 - might be able to get lucky for a while I
99:57 - got lucky with it for like two years but
100:02 - then I had a client not pay me and it
100:04 - just it took forever to get paid luckily
100:06 - I did finally get paid but
100:08 - months after I was supposed to receive a
100:11 - payment so anyway I know I just threw a
100:15 - lot at you hopefully I'll have some time
100:18 - to put that in a more organized format
100:20 - in a video at some point but let me know
100:24 - if you have any other questions let me
100:27 - know maybe it'll be good I can write all
100:29 - the questions down and then try to make
100:31 - sure I answer them in my video
100:48 - Blake asks what should I use for
100:49 - wireframing on Windows for free um hmm
100:56 - I'm not sure of Windows what does the
101:02 - thing Adobe came out is it called Adobe
101:08 - XD it was something like that but I
101:12 - don't know if it was free it might have
101:14 - just been free when you they were
101:15 - testing it so I'm not sure I don't have
101:22 - anything that I use for Windows so I
101:24 - don't know of anything but if anyone
101:28 - else knows of anything good and free to
101:31 - do wireframes on Windows please put that
101:34 - in the lab chat now
101:46 - okay John Hanson says I think the big
101:49 - guys like Google are pushing for
101:50 - developers to use local storage dragon
101:53 - on it says go for local storage or local
101:56 - forage module okay cool yeah maybe we'll
102:07 - maybe we'll check into that it's
102:09 - switching it over to local storage
102:13 - Harshit says it would definitely be
102:14 - harder to set that up so we'll check it
102:17 - out
102:21 - maybe we'll see how difficult it will be
102:23 - if it'll be worth it to set it up I'm
102:25 - for this project I'm not worried one way
102:28 - or the other if we're gonna switch it
102:31 - over I would want to do it because if
102:33 - that's the the best practice to do then
102:36 - I think it would be cool to do that on
102:38 - the stream just to show this is how we
102:42 - should do things but otherwise I think
102:44 - cookies will be more than adequate for
102:47 - this use case rohan says the it's quite
102:54 - the irony because most of google
102:56 - services rely heavily on cookies most
102:58 - don't even touch local stores yeah
103:00 - you're right actually
103:02 - that's definitely true
103:22 - rook says Google is weird like that they
103:24 - don't even use angular from what I've
103:26 - heard oh yeah I don't I don't know I
103:29 - usually check with which sites are made
103:32 - out of I haven't done that for a while
103:33 - with Google Sites
103:46 - everyone says using Google API is it's
103:48 - quite common that you can see them say
103:50 - to do the opposite of what they usually
103:52 - say you would usually do really
103:55 - frustrating but that's Google they use
103:57 - angular across many things now
104:06 - okay so dragon hunter says HTTP only
104:09 - cookies are not vulnerable to XSS
104:12 - attacks cross-site scripting attacks but
104:15 - to CSRF attacks so the session could be
104:18 - hijacked okay actually to be honest with
104:22 - you for this project the data is not
104:26 - really sensitive most of the data that
104:29 - ends up in the bulletin is also publicly
104:31 - available through other channels so I'm
104:33 - not that worried about it to be honest
104:35 - with you I never thought that this
104:37 - bulletin should have to be password
104:39 - protected that was a decision made
104:40 - higher up and I fought against it but I
104:43 - lost so I'm not super worried about the
104:49 - security in terms of if somebody really
104:52 - wants to find out you know the what's
104:54 - going on in the bulletin like they're
104:57 - gonna know the dates of when you can go
104:59 - get training on PowerPoint and they're
105:02 - gonna they're going to know what open
105:04 - positions that we have at the University
105:06 - which you can already find out on the
105:07 - main website they're gonna see the
105:10 - chapel's schedule for when they're there
105:12 - are mass times which you can already see
105:13 - on the main web site so there are very
105:15 - few things it I would argue there's
105:18 - pretty much nothing that should that
105:21 - couldn't be public knowledge but anyway
105:25 - I was told that an easy password
105:27 - protected so that's what I'm going to do
105:28 - and I'm gonna provide a reasonable level
105:30 - of security but I'm not going to kind of
105:34 - over engineer this so that we're
105:35 - protected from all everything that could
105:38 - possibly happen if at some point we end
105:40 - up working with more sensitive data then
105:43 - definitely yes I think we should be as
105:45 - safe as we can but I think it
105:48 - potentially could be a waste of a waste
105:52 - of our time to really try to you know
105:55 - make this solid and you know airtight
105:57 - and no one can get in
106:10 - Harshit says I remember some guy named a
106:12 - folder it's the the little Tod icon and
106:16 - and he did RM RF tilde and his whole
106:20 - date it was wiped yeah yeah that you
106:23 - could literally wipe out everything on
106:25 - your hard drive with RM RF so like don't
106:28 - use it unless you for sure know what's
106:31 - going on dragon under says to choose
106:38 - between CSRF and XSS definitely take
106:43 - measures about XSS and forget about CSRF
106:47 - soar local storage all the way
106:56 - okay rook says I heard some guys on the
106:59 - syntax podcast talking about how scary
107:01 - our MRF is they suggest using something
107:06 - called trash it's on brew okay cool
107:08 - oh maybe I'll look into that right now I
107:13 - I rarely use RM RF when I do use it
107:16 - obviously like I I'm very careful about
107:18 - it but if I find myself having to use it
107:21 - more often might not be a bad idea to
107:23 - switch to something a little safer
107:40 - dragon hunter says is there a yarn lock
107:44 - like npm yeah yes there is a yarn lock
107:50 - file and then in a new version of NPM
107:52 - there's the equivalent file ok harsh
107:59 - it's saying basically since I'm using
108:01 - react 16 many packages are not updated
108:04 - that so that's that's probably why I'm
108:06 - getting the warnings okay dragon owner
108:17 - says our MRF node modules works with NPM
108:19 - it seems to not with yarn yeah I mean I
108:22 - guess if you really wanted to get rid of
108:23 - it you should get rid of your yarn lock
108:25 - file too so you could R get rid all the
108:28 - node modules and your yarn lock and then
108:31 - you could reinstall the from that way if
108:34 - you really wanted it to be totally clean
108:36 - slate all Roland says you could also use
108:44 - the force flag to force reinstall of all
108:47 - node packages all right good to know
108:50 - thanks your honor
109:34 - okay I think I think John Hanson is is
109:37 - explaining more is his question earlier
109:39 - about react like moving up to get I
109:44 - don't remember exactly what it was but
109:46 - he's saying vanilla Jas allows easily
109:50 - moving up and down the Dom to create
109:52 - comparison statement is true Falls to
109:54 - render an object I'm not sure if it's
109:56 - smart to do the same in react okay I'm
109:59 - not sure I might need to see a use case
110:01 - to give a decent answer to that so
110:05 - anyway so John if you if you have a use
110:10 - case then maybe I could I could give an
110:12 - opinion on that
110:28 - okay world's us how much would you
110:30 - charge or get for an average project
110:33 - okay I'm going to be I'm going to be
110:34 - completely honest here about what I
110:39 - charge and what I get so I'm not going
110:41 - to name names of clients and they may
110:43 - not want people to know what they what I
110:45 - get paid but I'll try to be vague about
110:47 - that but I'll tell you so when I started
110:49 - out five years ago I started out working
110:54 - getting work from someone else for $10
110:57 - an hour so which is a little bit crazy
111:02 - right I had two kids at the time and
111:07 - I've didn't pay $10 an hour or working
111:10 - less than full time doing this web work
111:14 - but the deal was basically the guy he
111:19 - knew me personally but he had no proof
111:22 - of my skills he just knew that back in
111:25 - high school I was smart and I was into
111:29 - technology stuff and he knew he could
111:31 - trust me so started me out and would say
111:35 - like hey I'll pay you $10 an hour but
111:39 - what I'll do is you know if you have a
111:41 - project that I need you to work on and
111:43 - you don't know how to do it I'll say you
111:45 - know take two hours I'll pay you for two
111:47 - hours to learn it and then do it right
111:49 - so I was able to learn a lot so I
111:52 - considered it like an internship only a
111:55 - paid internship which it really was kind
111:59 - of like that I learned a lot now what a
112:01 - you did say as well is that every slide
112:04 - on three months or something I'd be up
112:06 - for a race so I ended up making more
112:10 - than that quickly now along the way I
112:17 - moved up certainly whenever I got my own
112:19 - clients I would charge more I got to the
112:23 - point where one of my last projects that
112:26 - I worked on I ended up I did a react
112:30 - site that pooled data in from the
112:32 - WordPress API very similar to what we
112:36 - did on
112:38 - one of that we worked on it was actually
112:43 - it was almost identical in terms of the
112:46 - structure of the project as project one
112:50 - which was the catechetical Institute
112:51 - website and this project I did and I
112:54 - believe I made eleven thousand seven
113:04 - hundred dollars something like that
113:07 - somewhere around so like around twelve
113:10 - hundred dollars or twelve thousand
113:12 - dollars for that website so there was a
113:16 - whole range of stepping up what I would
113:20 - charge people and then it did sometimes
113:23 - depend on who I was doing the work for a
113:27 - nonprofit occasionally I would do work
113:31 - for free for a non-profit if I really
113:33 - wanted to Baal volunteer or I would at
113:36 - least I would give a discount sometimes
113:39 - if you know someone that was family or
113:42 - friend wanted something give him a
113:43 - discount but in general when you're
113:47 - freelancing it's always best to charge
113:50 - more than you think it's really worth
113:54 - because you have to consider more than
113:57 - just the project at hand because there's
113:59 - going to be over it so there's going to
114:01 - be meetings with the client phone calls
114:03 - you know Skype you know video
114:05 - conferencing there's going to be work on
114:08 - you getting a contract made and
114:11 - discussing that getting that sign you're
114:14 - gonna have to spend time sending bills
114:17 - making sure your client actually sends
114:19 - the bills so reminding them about that
114:23 - potentially even having disputes over
114:26 - billing there's going to be all this
114:29 - extra stuff then you have to worry about
114:30 - doing your taxes there's all this other
114:34 - stuff that's involved that you need to
114:37 - account for in the price so you're
114:40 - always going to end up charging more as
114:42 - a freelancer then you'd be willing to
114:43 - accept as a salary if you are on
114:46 - somebody's payroll and then don't forget
114:48 - about insurance as well health insurance
114:52 - you know sometimes your employer would
114:55 - cover that but now you are your own
114:56 - employer so always factoring more at
114:59 - this point in my with my work I would
115:04 - probably depends on the project
115:07 - potentially if it was some project I was
115:09 - really passionate about maybe I would I
115:13 - would do it for less but I wouldn't even
115:14 - consider doing work for anyone right now
115:16 - for less than $100 an hour
115:18 - if I was going hourly if we're talking a
115:21 - flat rate I mean I don't know that it
115:26 - would be worth my time to work on
115:28 - anything for less than like $5,000 I
115:32 - just wouldn't want to I just wouldn't
115:35 - want to deal with the whole process of
115:36 - building trust with a client and
115:38 - contracts and billing and all that in
115:40 - taxes unless I was making a decent chunk
115:43 - of money like I said it depends on the
115:47 - project if something I really wanted to
115:48 - work on then I would probably be willing
115:50 - to do less if something happened and I
115:54 - really needed money I'd probably be
115:55 - willing to do less but that's where I'm
115:57 - at right now I have income coming in
116:00 - that I'm able to pay my bills so I'm in
116:02 - a different position if I was at a point
116:05 - where I really needed to build up my
116:06 - portfolio I'd probably be willing to
116:08 - work for Less also it depends on where
116:11 - you're at if I lived in San Francisco I
116:13 - would I would never work for that little
116:17 - I would work one even more money because
116:19 - the cost of living is so much more I
116:21 - happen to live in the part of the United
116:23 - States where the cost of living is
116:24 - pretty low the area I live is
116:27 - economically depressed so I can I can
116:32 - charge less people in big cities would
116:35 - obviously want to charge more and then
116:36 - depending on what country you're from I
116:38 - it depends I don't know what you know
116:41 - the economies could be entirely
116:42 - different so anyway I could you know
116:47 - keep that in mind especially if your
116:49 - area like my area is economically
116:52 - depressed try to build up your client
116:54 - base outside that area for me I ended up
116:57 - building a client base in New York City
117:00 - I actually also had a client that she
117:04 - was based in Hawaii
117:06 - but she traveled quite a bit so I don't
117:09 - know how often she actually lived in
117:11 - Hawaii but those clients ended up being
117:14 - the most profitable because they for
117:18 - their market my prices seem like really
117:20 - good prayer for them for me I'd make
117:24 - from them more than anybody else was
117:26 - willing to pay in my local area so it
117:29 - was a great deal for both of us
117:30 - you know they were getting a better deal
117:32 - than they could get in their area and so
117:34 - was I so those kind of seek out those
117:38 - kind of deals and then you know you and
117:41 - the client can both be really happy
117:43 - about about what you're making hopefully
117:49 - that helped the original question was
117:50 - how much you charge or get for an
117:52 - average product project so that was
117:54 - probably way more than you wanted from
117:57 - that question but I hope it it helped
118:00 - you out at least some Blake as our vem
118:11 - and Emax considered code editors slash
118:14 - IDs
118:15 - I think the minimax would fall under the
118:19 - code editor category I don't think
118:23 - they're considered IDs I don't use them
118:27 - though I mean I've tried out vim but I
118:29 - don't actively use them so I don't know
118:33 - maybe for some I know there are some
118:36 - people who watch a stream that do use
118:38 - them so please correct me if I'm wrong
118:41 - about that
118:59 - okay harsh it's asking a question about
119:01 - a specific piece of code so let me let
119:05 - me get this on the screen
119:18 - okay let me pull this over here all
119:23 - right so let's check this code out so
119:24 - Harsha's question is okay so she's a
119:35 - verified label I have set up GPG keys
119:39 - what do you think about this
120:10 - actually I've never used these before so
120:12 - let me see
120:34 - okay cool so I I mean I think that's
120:38 - cool that's fine to do what's the what's
120:41 - the main benefit of the GPG key
121:20 - well okay so earlier I mentioned Adobe
121:23 - XD I didn't I didn't know what the
121:24 - status of that was so it seems like the
121:26 - beta version is is still free so if I
121:30 - guess if you can get ahold of the beta
121:31 - version then then you could use it John
121:38 - Hanson says true Jesse talking about
121:40 - what you do and know is a great selling
121:43 - strategy I've had offers to build sites
121:45 - I've had to turn down as I've got my job
121:48 - beside some websites or beyond my skills
121:51 - yeah actually that that reminds me is
121:54 - well if even if you know other
121:56 - developers and get to talk to them they
122:00 - may send you projects like I know I've
122:03 - had people ask me about doing websites
122:08 - for them and I've just been too busy at
122:10 - the time and so I've passed those
122:12 - projects along to other developers that
122:15 - I know and sometimes it works out really
122:19 - well for those developers so if you get
122:22 - to know other developers and let them
122:25 - know that you're you're open annoying
122:28 - work if they trust you and they've seen
122:30 - what you can do and they know it's good
122:32 - work then they probably will have no
122:33 - problem sending people to you so that's
122:38 - that's another good way to find work
122:57 - heart should ask if I've installed
122:59 - compass not yet it finished downloading
123:01 - I didn't saw at the but Harsha says you
123:05 - should see the database structure there
123:06 - ok cool off to check it out
123:20 - let's see if this bulletin was a real
123:24 - project how much would you have charged
123:27 - okay let me think about this
123:31 - the bulletin so the bulletin site is
123:41 - basically a blog site right it's a blog
123:45 - site it's set up WordPress if two
123:47 - different servers to set up probably not
123:50 - going to run load balancing it's not
123:52 - that important that it needs it
123:55 - I set up the SSL now the complicated
124:03 - thing I guess is the login but we may
124:07 - even have more to login then we
124:10 - currently have depending on on what
124:11 - happens with the IT department here
124:15 - let's see we have custom stuff done on
124:21 - the WordPress end so there is going to
124:22 - be custom post types who are already
124:24 - running the graph QL plug-in so it's a
124:31 - significant project I mean this this
124:33 - would be this project I'm thinking right
124:38 - now obviously is depending on the
124:42 - organization and and fact there's you
124:44 - know such as my time and things like
124:47 - that but I'm thinking this website would
124:49 - probably end up being you know more
124:54 - closer to like a ten thousand dollar
124:59 - site so our baby set that as a minimum
125:01 - of 10,000 dollar site I mean that's just
125:06 - kind of off the top of my head if I was
125:07 - really gonna price this out I would I
125:09 - would sit down and so like you know I do
125:13 - with my Trello boards and I break things
125:16 - down if I was really gonna give an
125:18 - estimate I would break all the work down
125:20 - like that estimate how long I take
125:22 - everything factoring in the
125:25 - obviously delays that normally happen
125:27 - and the other stuff that you need to do
125:29 - on a project so but a very loose
125:32 - estimate would probably be I probably
125:34 - wouldn't do it for less than than 10,000
125:39 - so that would I mean and that also
125:42 - includes like you know I'm doing this
125:44 - for clients so there would be rigorous
125:45 - testing there would be training involved
125:47 - I would probably do training videos and
125:49 - some in-person training for whoever is
125:51 - going to be you know inputting the data
125:53 - so it's not necessarily just the
125:56 - development I would include that in the
125:58 - cost as well but anyway that's what I
126:02 - would charge now but they said it does
126:06 - really make a difference there are times
126:07 - when if I'm really busy and someone
126:11 - wants me to do a website I I'll quote
126:14 - them something more than I normally
126:16 - would because my time is more scarce
126:20 - therefore it's more valuable to me so to
126:24 - make it worth my while to work on that
126:26 - project which basically means for me is
126:28 - I'm not gonna see my family while I'm
126:30 - doing that work right so so for me it's
126:36 - I guess there's two there's two sides to
126:39 - the pricing is how much value can you
126:40 - bring to the client which is important
126:42 - because that's what they care about but
126:44 - then there's also how much do you value
126:46 - your own time which is also important
126:48 - because that's what you care about so
126:50 - you need to think about both things and
126:52 - as long as what you value your time to
126:56 - be corresponds roughly to what they
126:59 - think the value you're gonna bring to
127:01 - them through your website is going to be
127:03 - then everybody's happy
127:04 - right so you just gotta meet up you have
127:11 - to find clients that kind of match up
127:14 - with with that so I mean obviously when
127:17 - you're thinking about how much you're
127:18 - gonna charge like you do think about
127:20 - your own experience and your skills as
127:22 - well but because that will help you to
127:26 - convince people that you're worth that
127:28 - much anyway hopefully that helps I don't
127:33 - know how much would you all charge where
127:36 - you're from your area
127:38 - and your skill set what do you think so
127:40 - if anybody has any estimates I know it's
127:43 - really hard to make estimates right on
127:44 - the spot
127:45 - but if anybody has estimates about what
127:48 - it would be like in your area of the
127:50 - world in terms of price let me know I'm
127:53 - really interested to hear that
128:16 - okay so the GPG code just actually
128:18 - verifies that that's really the person
128:21 - that says it is okay cool
128:23 - that's what I figured I just kind of
128:25 - want to know if there was some other
128:26 - reason so yeah I like that that's cool
128:36 - dragon owner said you should do some
128:38 - podcasting you sound like an authority
128:40 - figure I don't know about that I don't
128:47 - actually have any authority
128:49 - I guess my if I have authority it would
128:52 - only be if if people value what I say
128:54 - that would be the only authority that I
128:56 - that I would have but I have experience
128:59 - though so for whatever that's worth like
129:03 - I can definitely give that
129:20 - michail says hey Jesse watching project
129:23 - 2 day 2 now and saw that you went live
129:25 - not really have a chance to watch online
129:27 - but thanks make good work keep it up
129:30 - Oh awesome thanks for stopping and in
129:32 - saying that I really appreciate that and
129:34 - hopefully you can join us live at some
129:36 - point and let me know what you think or
129:38 - any questions that you have we're
129:39 - suggestions but anyway yeah thanks again
129:44 - Blake says $10,000 as well
129:47 - Harshit says you know $10,000 is a year
129:50 - income in India I didn't know that but
129:56 - that's that's cool to know world says it
130:02 - used graph q oh and react yeah I mean
130:06 - think about I think that's an important
130:11 - point to remember a world sang use graph
130:13 - QL and reacts like a client might not
130:17 - necessarily know what graph QL and react
130:20 - is or even care but as a developer like
130:23 - we know the value in that that reacting
130:25 - graph QL are really the technologies
130:30 - that are I don't want to say emerging
130:33 - because Reax been around for a while and
130:34 - graph heels been around for a while but
130:36 - in terms of like very widespread
130:37 - adoption you know the vast majority of
130:42 - the internet is still jQuery territory
130:44 - right I mean as much as developers you
130:48 - know kind of want to stay away from it
130:49 - realistically it's used on a huge
130:52 - portion of the internet right so some of
130:54 - these newer technologies that aren't
130:58 - really new to us because we're
131:00 - developers but in the grand scheme of
131:01 - things in terms of how much they're
131:04 - really used on the internet they they
131:05 - are pretty new they're pretty cutting
131:07 - edge so the value of being able to use
131:12 - those technologies I think warrants a
131:17 - higher price tag now you may have
131:20 - trouble convincing the average person
131:22 - the average client of why this is
131:26 - important for their site how will this
131:28 - will help their site to be better right
131:31 - so
131:33 - while for a project like this maybe it
131:36 - would be hard to find a client who's
131:37 - willing to see the value in this and
131:39 - want to pay that much so but if I were
131:43 - to do a site that had everything that
131:44 - we're doing using all the technology
131:46 - that we're using I would want to charge
131:48 - at least $10,000
131:51 - so there's definitely that do I think I
131:54 - could find a client locally that would
131:56 - pay ten thousand no not in my local area
131:58 - could I find one somewhere else
132:00 - definitely I've no doubt about it I've I
132:04 - personally have have known I know what
132:10 - companies have paid for websites I've
132:12 - worked on those websites as a
132:14 - subcontractor I know so I I know enough
132:17 - to know that there are a lot of
132:19 - companies out there government
132:21 - organizations and institutions that are
132:23 - willing to pay an obscene amount of
132:25 - money for products that aren't even
132:27 - really that good
132:28 - so if you're starting out $10,000 seems
132:33 - like a lot especially if you're dealing
132:35 - with like local small businesses but
132:38 - when you get to another level of client
132:40 - which should be the goal he really want
132:42 - to make money when you get up there to
132:44 - the larger organizations ten thousand
132:47 - dollars is nothing to them you know
132:50 - you're they're dealing with budgets of
132:51 - millions of dollars so if they're gonna
132:55 - they're gonna drop a hundred thousand
132:57 - dollars on a website and budget that out
132:59 - and saying okay we're gonna do a website
133:01 - every three or four years we're gonna
133:03 - get an update a hundred thousand for
133:05 - this you know so it you know it breaks
133:07 - down to you know maybe 20,000 a year
133:10 - 25,000 a year and they're gonna think
133:12 - that's not really a big deal right that
133:14 - doesn't even cover our electric bills
133:16 - you know they're they're gonna think in
133:18 - terms of I'm gonna spend twenty five
133:22 - thousand dollars a year on a website I
133:24 - buy one truck for my company and it's
133:27 - probably gonna cost me $20,000 $25,000
133:30 - right and they're mine like you got to
133:34 - put it to them like that right the
133:35 - website is the public face of a business
133:37 - how much do people spend on building a
133:40 - building for their business and making
133:42 - it look nice millions right I'm
133:46 - have homes that are in the millions of
133:47 - dollars so a business to build their
133:49 - actual physical business will think
133:52 - nothing about spending millions on it
133:54 - their website they're going to be able
133:56 - to reach more people so put in terms
133:58 - like that of how important it is ten
134:03 - thousand dollars is nothing I can come
134:05 - out with ten thousand dollars to some
134:07 - companies and they would laugh at me and
134:08 - say no because they're thinking the work
134:12 - that this guy's doing must be terrible
134:14 - if he thinks he can only get ten
134:15 - thousand dollars off of this right so
134:18 - when you when you're thinking about
134:20 - things like that don't get discouraged
134:26 - try to think in terms of what what are
134:32 - the budgets for these companies you know
134:35 - now if you're dealing with a really
134:37 - small business that has three employees
134:40 - and stuff yeah don't walk her in and say
134:42 - I'm gonna build your website and it's
134:44 - gonna cost ten thousand dollars they're
134:45 - gonna say you got to be kidding me like
134:48 - my rent every month is less than a
134:49 - thousand dollars I'm not going to pay
134:51 - you ten thousand dollars for a website
134:54 - because potentially that could be around
134:56 - here where I live
134:57 - that's really it's reasonable as some
135:00 - people have really low rents for their
135:02 - buildings so because the area is so
135:04 - depressed and other areas the United
135:05 - States that's kind of ridiculous but
135:08 - anyway just try to think like I mean I
135:12 - guess I'm trying to like give you a
135:14 - little pep talk at least to keep your
135:16 - mind open to the reality of what
135:19 - businesses spend and how they're
135:22 - thinking and what they are already
135:24 - paying for products so don't sell
135:27 - yourself short just because something
135:31 - might seem easy right to us building
135:33 - this there have been some there's been
135:35 - some trouble right there's been some
135:37 - hard things right that grid layout that
135:39 - masonry layout was a pain for Harshit to
135:41 - put in and the the author the whole
135:45 - authorization login system was really
135:47 - impressive and that took some time but
135:51 - really for us this seems like oh no big
135:54 - deal we do this every day but there's
135:56 - not a whole lot of people in the world
135:58 - that can
135:58 - this kind of thing and and do it
136:00 - professionally and be trustworthy and
136:02 - have it work and be able to handle a lot
136:05 - of people that there's value in that
136:10 - especially yeah big businesses see value
136:12 - in that so don't sell yourself short
136:15 - anyway I keep going off on these big
136:18 - tangents I need to just make this
136:19 - freelancing video and and then direct
136:21 - you all to that or my live streams are
136:23 - gonna end up being three hours long
136:25 - every day okay okay so for this same
136:34 - project rollin is saying in India if he
136:38 - were to try to sell the same project he
136:41 - would charge about three thousand five
136:43 - hundred US dollars equivalent now in
136:47 - India
137:04 - Rowland says there really isn't much
137:06 - demand for webpages or services here in
137:08 - India small businesses will go for the
137:09 - cheapest bidder and large companies have
137:12 - their own team or will contract with the
137:14 - whole team John Hanson says great advice
137:19 - awesome thanks for that yeah I mean
137:22 - hopefully the worst the client can say
137:25 - if you come out with a really outrageous
137:27 - offer that's our offer that seems
137:30 - outrageous to them you know a quote for
137:32 - a price the worst they can do is say no
137:34 - but you know so what they say no maybe
137:41 - you don't really want to work for a
137:43 - company that doesn't value what you do
137:45 - enough to pay you would what the work is
137:48 - really worth so so you just don't be
137:52 - afraid it's a bad path to go down to
137:55 - constantly be apprehensive about what a
137:57 - client's gonna think is reasonable and
137:59 - try to always undercut yourself because
138:02 - you go down that path and where does it
138:04 - stop you end up doing quality work for
138:07 - less money than you should and then you
138:11 - get the type of client who doesn't value
138:12 - your work so even though you know you're
138:15 - giving them a great deal they don't
138:17 - understand that and that's not really
138:19 - the type of client you want to be
138:20 - involved with I've been there I've been
138:22 - involved with that type of client you're
138:24 - giving them a great deal and and they're
138:25 - trying and then at the end of the day
138:27 - what they do is they try to you know if
138:31 - if you're saving them a thousand dollars
138:33 - off of what they would pay they're still
138:35 - gonna try to squeeze out you know an
138:37 - extra hundred dollars off you in the end
138:39 - and said well I'm not paying for this
138:40 - because something's off with it right
138:43 - that's what that's what ends up
138:46 - happening so just go for good quality
138:52 - clients that are willing to pay with
138:54 - something's worth and you'll be much
138:55 - happier if you have to take the the
138:58 - cheaper stuff to build your portfolio up
139:01 - there's nothing wrong with that if you
139:02 - have to take some of that stuff to pay
139:04 - the bills and take care of your family
139:06 - there's nothing wrong with that I've
139:07 - been there and I've done that but when
139:09 - you get to a point where you're
139:11 - comfortable enough with your finances
139:13 - that you can afford to take some risks
139:15 - go for the bigger clients and then
139:17 - once you get there and get those clients
139:19 - in your portfolio it'll be a lot easier
139:24 - uh okay let's see Blake says thanks did
139:33 - you see the link for the repo I did not
139:39 - see the link for the repo did you paste
139:43 - them in live chat I missed it
139:49 - if you could paste it again that'd be
139:50 - great I could try to go back through and
139:52 - look for it but it'll be more of a sure
139:55 - thing if you could paste it again Oh
140:03 - Harshit says yes you tried doing UI for
140:05 - emails tomorrow if you really want me to
140:08 - do you eyes for email I will do that but
140:11 - for those of you that have worked on UI
140:13 - for emails you understand where I'm
140:15 - coming from I'm sure if you haven't
140:17 - you'll see it's not it's not the easiest
140:21 - thing but I'll do it if that's what if
140:24 - this what you all want to see okay cool
140:27 - thanks Blake I got the URL now all right
140:36 - haha world says companies aren't
140:39 - apprehensive in selling you a smartphone
140:40 - for a thousand dollars yeah you're
140:43 - absolutely right I mean think about
140:45 - think about what companies expect you
140:47 - all to pay for their services and then
140:52 - you know maybe it'll make it easier for
140:57 - you to to charge them more
141:13 - all right so a Blake Blake let me know
141:17 - what in particular you want me to check
141:18 - out on this on this repo and I'll try to
141:21 - check it out
141:22 - and you can you don't have to tell me
141:24 - now if you want to make an issue on the
141:27 - repo then we could like we could talk
141:29 - about it you know in the comments of
141:31 - that issue if you want however you want
141:33 - to do it
141:54 - okay well I'm to the end of the live
141:59 - chat now I think we had a great chat we
142:01 - probably spent more time talking than we
142:02 - did with coding but today I feel like is
142:06 - the first time in a while that we
142:07 - accomplished everything that we wanted
142:08 - to accomplish actually a little bit more
142:11 - I didn't even expect to do the masonry
142:13 - layout and get that all merged in so we
142:15 - actually accomplished even more I know I
142:17 - ended up talking a lot so sorry if it
142:21 - was too much but I hope I helped some of
142:24 - you out and sharing my experiences with
142:27 - with freelancing but this dream has been
142:32 - really long and I'm actually like really
142:35 - hot and sweating right now because it's
142:37 - all in my office I didn't want to turn
142:38 - the fan on and mess up the audio so I've
142:42 - got to get a drink and get out of this
142:43 - office my wife just called me too so I'm
142:48 - gonna see what she needs and I'll be
142:51 - back tomorrow thank you so much for all
142:55 - your help
142:56 - Harshit especially thank you in
142:58 - Sebastian for your pool requests you all
143:01 - have been great and I mean Harshit I
143:04 - knew you're talking about freelancing
143:06 - stuff and you're still a student and
143:07 - you're young so that makes it hard but
143:09 - you have skills
143:10 - you definitely have skills so you just
143:15 - need the right connections and I think
143:17 - you'll be fine and in terms of doing
143:20 - work right now though when you're young
143:21 - this is a great opportunity to study and
143:24 - work on those side projects that you
143:26 - really really want to if you need the
143:29 - money I totally understand if you got to
143:31 - take some projects but otherwise I
143:32 - wouldn't worry about freelancing so much
143:34 - right now I would worry I would try to
143:37 - take advantage of this time in your life
143:39 - to work on things that you really want
143:41 - to work on because once you start
143:43 - working for clients you don't have the
143:45 - same amount of freedom like you could
143:46 - now so but anyway I think you have a lot
143:50 - of talent and I think so many of you in
143:53 - the live chat and the watch the shows
143:55 - have so much talent I'm always impressed
143:57 - with with which you all show me so
144:00 - anyway thank you and I will be back
144:06 - tomorrow
144:07 - so until then
144:08 - have a great day
