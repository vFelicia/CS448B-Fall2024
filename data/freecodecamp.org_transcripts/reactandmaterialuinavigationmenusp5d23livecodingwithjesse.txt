00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:05 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:08 - going to do some
00:10 - work with our navigation
00:13 - so this will be more proper front-end
00:15 - work
00:16 - i know we've been doing some back-end
00:18 - work lately
00:21 - but
00:22 - today we're going to get back to the
00:23 - front end
00:25 - and i think i finally sorted out all the
00:28 - issues that i've been having uh with
00:31 - stream quality
00:33 - so i should be running now assuming that
00:36 - your internet connection is fast enough
00:38 - it should run
00:39 - at 1080p 60 frames
00:42 - frames per second
00:45 - the problem uh didn't have anything to
00:47 - do with my settings in obs uh it was
00:50 - with my computer so
00:53 - uh what i found was
00:55 - depending on what i had running
01:00 - i would drop a lot of frames uh so
01:04 - i've turned off
01:07 - all the programs that i don't need
01:09 - and i've closed out
01:12 - most of the tabs that i could
01:15 - and i tested out i'd i'd close
01:17 - everything and it would work i'd open
01:18 - more stuff and it didn't work so
01:21 - so far this works i tested earlier for a
01:23 - little while and it worked the whole
01:25 - time i tested it just this past half
01:27 - hour and only for a few seconds did it
01:30 - drop frames so i think we're good
01:34 - and
01:35 - i don't know really what changed the
01:37 - only thing i did differently on my
01:38 - computer other than close out a lot of
01:40 - things which we already tried before
01:42 - was uh i downloaded the latest update
01:45 - uh for the mac os
01:48 - so there was when i came in this morning
01:49 - there's an update available so i just
01:51 - went ahead and did that
01:53 - straight off and
01:57 - that that seemed to do something because
01:59 - my fan wasn't running
02:02 - you know
02:03 - basically it's been running
02:05 - really hard
02:07 - the whole time i've been using it for
02:08 - the last week
02:10 - so that's all
02:12 - all sorted out hopefully
02:15 - and
02:17 - so we'll get started i don't have
02:20 - anything going on so depending on how
02:22 - the stream goes you might be able to do
02:24 - a longer stream today uh we'll just see
02:29 - uh so let me check the live chat
02:32 - here for a second
02:34 - um
02:38 - not sure i'll see this one live
02:41 - all right so if you you are gonna be
02:43 - able to watch live that's cool
02:45 - thanks for uh for stopping in and saying
02:47 - hi
02:48 - and um as you all know you can always
02:51 - check out the recording later
02:53 - um
02:54 - savage banana says howdy complete noob
02:57 - here done a few bits on free code camp
02:59 - about to do a boot camp looking forward
03:01 - to watching you this evening even though
03:03 - i probably won't understand now i'll be
03:05 - soaking it in all right awesome thanks
03:07 - for watching and feel free to ask as
03:09 - many questions as you want don't worry
03:11 - if you think it's a noob question or
03:13 - something
03:14 - i'm i'm happy to explain something and
03:16 - go over anything that you need
03:19 - all right john said the stream's going
03:20 - well peter says it's looking clean too
03:23 - awesome
03:24 - the ninja says this channel is dope
03:26 - thank you i appreciate that
03:30 - uh abu says will you start coding now
03:33 - i will i will start coding and um
03:36 - as always i know there's some of you
03:37 - that don't like the talking part and you
03:39 - just like the coding part
03:40 - so if that's the case i mean i really
03:43 - love when you can watch live that's
03:44 - awesome
03:45 - but if if it does bother you all the
03:48 - talking uh then
03:50 - feel free to watch the recording
03:52 - and you can just skip ahead
03:54 - and um
03:56 - basically anytime you see just my face
03:58 - and no code then you're safe to skip
04:00 - that
04:02 - and that's totally fine i understand
04:04 - there's not really enough time in the
04:05 - day to listen to me go on and on anyway
04:08 - all right so let's get started
04:12 - and let's change my screen
04:16 - so
04:17 - i'll explain what we're going to do
04:20 - briefly
04:21 - and then we'll we'll get to it
04:24 - so we already talked about
04:26 - what we want to do with this navigation
04:27 - in previous streams
04:29 - in case you've forgotten or you didn't
04:31 - catch that stream here's what's going to
04:33 - happen when we click on one of these
04:35 - links
04:37 - it's going to open up this side
04:40 - drawer
04:41 - and we're gonna have the same links as
04:43 - top level navigation here so it'll say
04:46 - it won't say inbox it'll say about
04:48 - academics admissions faith and life
04:50 - and they'll all be
04:53 - expandable
04:55 - so open up this side navigation with the
04:58 - correct item expanded and all the
05:00 - options shown
05:02 - for instance if i clicked about
05:04 - the about option would be expanded
05:07 - everything else
05:08 - would be not expanded
05:12 - uh so
05:13 - that's the goal what i want to do now
05:15 - the reason i decided to switch and do
05:17 - this today instead of working on some of
05:18 - the stuff we have been working on is
05:20 - well two-fold one
05:22 - the stuff that we've been working on
05:24 - lately is going to get real repetitive
05:26 - we've worked out a lot of the
05:28 - you know kind of tough problems that
05:30 - we've had
05:31 - mostly to do with routing and bringing
05:32 - data over now it's just a matter of
05:35 - taking the time to actually do that i
05:37 - don't want to make boring streams of me
05:39 - just constantly doing the same thing
05:41 - over and over again
05:42 - and the second reason is i'm starting to
05:44 - show people this site so i showed my
05:46 - boss's site last week and
05:49 - one of the things that we went over is
05:51 - the menu and i went to click these and i
05:53 - i remembered oh we never made that work
05:57 - and he had asked it was a bit
06:00 - uh we had i discussed it before my boss
06:02 - but it was a long time ago so i had to
06:04 - go over again
06:05 - when we click this then it's going to do
06:07 - that so i think it would be a lot easier
06:09 - when i start to show it to more people
06:11 - to just have it working even if the
06:12 - links don't even go anywhere yet
06:15 - which they won't because we haven't
06:17 - built out you know most of the site yet
06:20 - but i want the functionality to work i
06:21 - think it'll be a lot easier to show
06:23 - people than to explain it
06:25 - so that's what we're going to do
06:28 - and
06:30 - let's see
06:32 - yeah let's check out the component it's
06:34 - been a while since we've even worked on
06:36 - these so i don't remember what we set up
06:38 - in the components
06:40 - and i'm going to be looking at them
06:42 - with fresh eyes basically
06:45 - so we have our app bar component
06:48 - which
06:49 - [Music]
06:51 - is where we'll have
06:55 - all right the wrap bar and our drawer
06:56 - are going to be the two components we're
06:58 - going to be working in today the most
07:00 - i already have this running let me get
07:02 - ngrok started for you all
07:15 - and i'm going to paste the link here in
07:16 - the live chat and you all can click on
07:19 - that link go to it
07:21 - and
07:25 - um
07:27 - let's see
07:30 - all right it looks like it is working
07:33 - great
07:35 - so anyway
07:37 - if you're not familiar with ngrok just
07:39 - click the link you'll be able to see
07:40 - this site
07:41 - as we're working on it and test out the
07:43 - changes you can inspect it in dev tools
07:47 - so it'll be a lot more interactive if
07:50 - you're able to to do that
07:55 - all right so let's check out
07:57 - if we have anything set up already so
07:59 - here's all our font icons now this
08:02 - component could definitely use some
08:03 - refactoring to clean it up a bit that's
08:05 - going to happen at some point but
08:09 - my opinion is
08:10 - if you have a deadline you have to meet
08:13 - you get everything working first you can
08:15 - always go back and refactor later but if
08:17 - you spend all your time refactoring and
08:19 - you don't get the project done
08:21 - nobody's gonna care the user's not gonna
08:23 - care when you try to explain to him
08:25 - about refactoring ah the stream's
08:27 - lagging again isn't it
08:30 - no
08:31 - why is it lagging maybe ngrug
08:33 - all right you know what let me shut down
08:35 - ngrok for a second
08:37 - and see if that made a difference
08:41 - because that was really the only
08:43 - different thing that we did right
08:45 - i've changed nothing else
08:59 - wow the video is lagging again
09:06 - have i
09:14 - try to think did i do anything else
09:16 - i don't think i did anything
09:19 - no
09:39 - why
09:40 - why
09:41 - why does it happen now what else is
09:43 - running on my machine
09:45 - it's nothing
09:49 - i guess i could turn off spotify
09:51 - let's turn spotify off
09:56 - um
09:57 - i'm not gonna have my music
09:59 - alright so spotify's off
10:04 - i guess that wasn't it i'm going to turn
10:06 - chrome canary off
10:09 - oh was that what i was using
10:13 - i didn't realize that was a canary
10:14 - window
10:15 - um
10:18 - and that's it i can't
10:20 - i can't turn anything else off
10:42 - um
10:47 - all right i guess i could draw
11:01 - all right am i back
11:10 - let me know if you can hear me
11:13 - obs is saying that everything's fine
11:18 - all right cool
11:21 - all right looks like this will work now
11:23 - and
11:26 - i'm gonna turn my spotify back on
11:29 - because
11:31 - that was not the problem
11:46 - all right cool
11:48 - i really thought i had that figured out
11:50 - this time
11:52 - oh well try again tomorrow
11:58 - unless i really like figure out
12:00 - something significant that fixes this
12:02 - i'm just gonna stream at 720p again
12:06 - tomorrow and not not risk it
12:09 - savage banana says try streaming at 30
12:12 - frames per second
12:13 - um yeah maybe i'll maybe i can try 1080p
12:17 - but at 30 frames per second
12:19 - see if that'll work
12:22 - i actually didn't even see a setting
12:23 - though for the frames per second which
12:25 - was weird
12:29 - it's possible i'm just looking
12:33 - in the wrong place
12:38 - oh well
12:39 - um
12:44 - all right
12:48 - so let's go
12:50 - let me start a timer
12:52 - so i can know when to come back
12:55 - and
12:56 - answer some questions
13:01 - see
13:12 - i'm gonna go i think this is harsh it
13:14 - right hard [ __ ] this is yours right
13:17 - the
13:17 - essays or pompom.now
13:23 - let's start this one
13:24 - i was using using three different
13:26 - pomodoro timers
13:28 - and uh two of them from that you all
13:31 - made and one of them that i had been
13:34 - using
13:35 - using for years
13:39 - i don't actually i don't know about
13:40 - years how long i've been to a pomodoro
13:41 - definitely more than a year
13:44 - potentially not longer than two though
13:49 - all right
13:53 - let's see
13:57 - all right let me make this a bit bigger
13:59 - so you all can see
14:01 - especially now that we've dropped the uh
14:03 - the video quality a little bit
14:07 - so hopefully that's
14:09 - large enough for you let me know if it's
14:11 - not
14:13 - so let's find our
14:18 - our menu
14:19 - see if we have any click handlers
14:21 - already on here that we can work with
14:22 - otherwise we'll make some
14:25 - let's see svg this is a search
14:32 - all right great so here's where we have
14:34 - this
14:37 - so it looks like
14:42 - all right it looks like we're using uh
14:44 - the typography component that comes with
14:46 - material ui
14:47 - to create an a tag
14:51 - and
14:57 - all right so right now just has an href
15:05 - okay
15:10 - i suppose we don't even really need it
15:12 - to be a link
15:16 - but for now
15:18 - let's
15:24 - let's see where the
15:26 - oops let me bring this
15:28 - back up
15:29 - i forgot we shut it down
15:32 - localhost
15:33 - 3
15:34 - 000.
15:36 - and let me try to bring ngrog back up
15:40 - because i don't think that was actually
15:42 - the problem
15:48 - all right so the links now
15:51 - um
15:52 - in the live chat
16:08 - all right i was just inspecting
16:11 - the this uh this is the li and this is
16:14 - just the a
16:16 - uh the a tag
16:18 - so i was wondering what would be better
16:21 - to put the link on
16:26 - or to you know have the click area
16:39 - hmm
16:42 - all right let me know what you all think
16:45 - uh
16:47 - i guess it would be
16:50 - either way it really doesn't matter i
16:52 - suppose
16:54 - except we may have a slightly larger
16:57 - area would we
16:59 - no we wouldn't
17:01 - i think it would be the same
17:08 - alright so it doesn't matter
17:18 - so let's try to do a
17:22 - an on click
17:30 - should we do an on click or non-touch
17:32 - [Music]
17:41 - anything
17:43 - untouched
17:45 - i was looking at a project that i did
17:47 - earlier and we were using on touch tap
17:49 - instead of
17:52 - on click but i can't remember why
17:56 - so i'm just going to go with on click
17:58 - and
18:02 - what we can always change it back if we
18:03 - want
18:06 - video section
18:09 - oh okay uh savage banana found the
18:11 - settings
18:12 - for the frames per second and it's on
18:14 - the
18:17 - um
18:18 - it's in the video section you know that
18:21 - that makes sense now i remember a while
18:23 - ago i had to go to the video section to
18:25 - change some stuff and i
18:27 - i remember because i thought it was it
18:29 - was weird that it was in there instead
18:30 - of the streaming
18:33 - all right harshit says that was mature
18:35 - ui uh 0.26 it's fixed
18:39 - with uh with one okay so
18:42 - we had to use it
18:44 - in a previous version but you don't have
18:46 - to use it now awesome
18:49 - uh thanks for that hardship
18:51 - all right so let's say
18:54 - um
19:08 - open side drawer
19:10 - this
19:12 - dot open side drawer all right so we
19:15 - haven't made it yet but
19:16 - we need to make it and we need to have
19:20 - we're going to pass it something huh
19:27 - yeah we have to pass it something
19:40 - all right so
19:45 - this dot open side drawer
19:47 - and
19:50 - passion
20:08 - hmm
20:22 - um
20:39 - all right so i'm just going to use the
20:40 - name
20:43 - which in this case is faith in life
20:46 - i'm gonna pass that in as a string
20:55 - we'll have to figure out maybe a better
20:57 - way to do this so we don't have to
20:58 - manually type it out but just to
21:01 - get it working first
21:04 - this should work for us
21:09 - so obviously i'd rather have a lot of
21:11 - this stuff in data files
21:14 - and then bring it in instead of having
21:17 - it all hard-coded
21:26 - i would have thought we already had some
21:28 - things built out for this
21:37 - uh all right i was thinking for some
21:39 - reason we had to have some type of click
21:41 - handler to open up the side drawer but
21:48 - we're pulling it in
21:54 - pulling that in from
22:06 - somewhere else i guess
22:13 - um
22:34 - okay
23:07 - i um think if we're going to need to
23:12 - what's this for sorry i'm trying to
23:15 - think out how this works uh we need
23:20 - so we need to be able to share what's
23:22 - going on with two components the app bar
23:24 - and the drawer so i'm assuming they're
23:25 - both tied together in the layout
23:28 - for drawer so i'm just wondering if this
23:30 - should all live in the layout
23:32 - which is where we're getting toggle
23:34 - drawer from
23:35 - so that's
23:37 - as expected i suppose
23:42 - yeah so maybe this is where the um
23:48 - where that should live
23:55 - yeah that makes sense
23:57 - um
24:02 - actually we already have an expansion
24:06 - for the drawer
24:11 - change handle click so the handle click
24:13 - we have in the drawer already expands
24:15 - the items so this is really what we want
24:17 - to use anyway
24:20 - let's pull this up into layout
24:26 - and then from app bar we should be able
24:28 - to just call this
24:30 - function and at the same time uh
24:34 - so we'll call
24:36 - this function and we'll call
24:40 - um
24:41 - the drawer toggle
24:43 - so we'll basically use what we already
24:45 - have
24:50 - i think that'll be the best way to do it
24:56 - all right john has some so faith in life
24:58 - link text should have white space no
25:02 - wrap
25:04 - all right cool thank you um
25:07 - i'll add that in
25:10 - i want to do this first why it's in my
25:11 - mind so i don't lose what i just
25:14 - what i just thought of
25:19 - all right so let's grab
25:21 - our handle click state open items the
25:24 - state open items
25:39 - all right so let me see how we need to
25:44 - pull this out i'm going to try to go
25:50 - i don't know if i could put these two
25:52 - side by side maybe if i close this it
25:54 - would work
25:58 - let me try it out
26:02 - oops
26:04 - this one's
26:08 - layout
26:10 - okay
26:28 - okay uh john has a question that has to
26:31 - do with what we're about to attempt says
26:33 - is it the best practice for a stateful
26:36 - uh furthest up container to control any
26:39 - actions below it pass with props
26:41 - if you need to share
26:46 - if you need to share the state
26:48 - then yes it should be in the parent uh
26:51 - but you you
26:52 - shouldn't get crazy with it so you
26:54 - shouldn't be passing things up like five
26:57 - components
26:58 - like five parent components
27:00 - and that's where things like redux come
27:02 - in and help simplify things so that you
27:05 - don't have to pass everything up
27:08 - from child to parent several levels up
27:10 - because then it can be really confusing
27:14 - and difficult especially if you're going
27:15 - to change something
27:17 - it trying to remember and and go in in
27:21 - every component and make sure
27:23 - you're still passing things down
27:24 - properly is can be difficult
27:28 - uh so i guess
27:30 - so we're not really using redux we're
27:32 - using
27:35 - what is it har should help me out here
27:36 - because harsh is the one was telling me
27:38 - about it
27:39 - so apollo
27:42 - now handles state in a similar way to
27:44 - redux so i guess we could do some of
27:47 - that i haven't worked with it exactly
27:50 - yet but i know that there was
27:52 - some significant update to where you can
27:55 - handle stuff but for now we only need to
27:57 - go up one
27:59 - component just to the parent so
28:02 - i'm totally fine with that
28:08 - if there's some reason why you all think
28:10 - that we should try to use something else
28:12 - to manage state
28:13 - instead of you know just passing it with
28:16 - with props then
28:18 - i'm definitely open to suggestions but i
28:20 - think this should work out in this case
28:22 - all right so here's our layout component
28:24 - this is our parent
28:26 - so what we want to do is add
28:28 - our handle click
28:32 - yeah our handle click
28:35 - we're going to add this over here i'm
28:37 - going to briefly keep the handle click
28:39 - here
28:40 - so that way
28:42 - i can see the original uh and if we edit
28:45 - this
28:46 - i can just go back quickly but then
28:47 - eventually we'll just remove this
28:51 - so what we want to do is pass down
28:53 - uh the handle click
28:55 - so
28:56 - just like we're we're handling we're
28:58 - passing down this toggle drawer
29:02 - so we have this
29:04 - toggle drawer and we're also passing
29:06 - down the state
29:10 - of this so we have this drawer uh true
29:13 - or false whether it's open or close
29:15 - we're gonna do the same thing
29:18 - we need to
29:21 - i'm gonna say handle click
29:29 - i guess we call it
29:35 - let's make this a little bit more
29:36 - descriptive
29:39 - because that's
29:41 - we're gonna have multiple click events
29:42 - going on
29:44 - uh so let's call it
29:49 - expand
29:50 - menu
29:53 - yeah that works
29:58 - expand menu
30:00 - and
30:01 - for expand menu
30:05 - this set state
30:14 - so let's make open
30:18 - open items
30:30 - that's odd how does this
30:32 - sorry i want to see how this behaves now
30:35 - we only have one item
30:41 - all right what i'm worried about here is
30:42 - our open items is just a true or false
30:45 - so i'm wondering if that works with
30:47 - multiple items
30:49 - so let's
30:53 - let's try that
30:55 - check that out quickly
31:08 - list item
31:21 - this class
31:32 - all right let's throw this in here just
31:34 - to see
31:45 - uh okay
31:47 - it's
31:48 - as i thought
31:50 - uh right now this is opening and closing
31:57 - everything
32:02 - which is not what we want
32:06 - we need to change that
32:18 - all right that's fine it's going to be a
32:19 - little bit more complex
32:24 - all right here's
32:26 - so we can do
32:38 - hmm
32:46 - all right what i'm thinking is
32:48 - so number one i want to separate this
32:51 - out
32:52 - into its own component this is way too
32:55 - much to have all of this in this
32:57 - component
32:58 - so the entire
33:01 - for sure we'll grab this whole list item
33:03 - and then the collapse
33:07 - component that comes with it
33:13 - and then we may even want to separate
33:15 - out
33:20 - this collapse as well
33:30 - yeah
33:31 - all right let's do that
33:33 - this is already
33:36 - a bit of a mess
33:41 - all right so let's open up a new
33:43 - tab here
33:59 - list item
34:02 - down to
34:08 - oops
34:15 - labs
34:17 - all right now here's what i
34:20 - we're gonna have to wrap this
34:23 - in a div
34:25 - hopefully it doesn't mess up how this
34:27 - works
34:29 - or how it looks
34:35 - yeah i don't i don't see how we could do
34:37 - that differently
34:40 - um so let's
34:42 - let's make
34:47 - we're gonna call this
35:18 - and
35:21 - render
35:26 - see how we do it
35:28 - yeah
35:29 - return
35:41 - all right great now we can
35:48 - copy and paste this down
35:57 - draw item
35:59 - and
35:59 - let's give it
36:01 - we need react
36:07 - and
36:09 - with styles
36:14 - and
36:16 - link
36:17 - for sure we need link
36:22 - wait are we using link i thought we were
36:24 - but now that i see it
36:27 - we're not all right we're not
36:30 - we need lists
36:33 - yeah we do need list and list item
36:38 - collapse
36:45 - expand less explain more
37:01 - and
37:06 - we need the divider
37:08 - i don't think so
37:11 - at least not yet
37:17 - all right now let's save this
37:22 - our components
37:23 - i'm going to call this
37:28 - drawer item
37:32 - dot js
37:35 - yay all right
37:41 - what did i mess up
37:43 - something
37:48 - oh that's right i need to put this in a
37:50 - div
38:02 - oh i think this is just indentation
38:07 - which
38:10 - all right
38:16 - fix in that problem six all in problems
38:20 - yeah let's see that all right great
38:23 - um
38:26 - classes is not defined so we need to
38:29 - make sure we bring
38:30 - that over
38:34 - classes
38:44 - oops all right the timer went off so let
38:46 - me stop here
38:48 - i'm gonna take five minutes i'm gonna
38:49 - answer any questions uh that you all
38:51 - have and then we'll come back and
38:54 - finish this up as much as we can
38:59 - also when i come back from the
39:00 - five-minute break maybe i'll take time
39:02 - to explain a little bit of what just
39:03 - happened if you're not familiar with
39:05 - react
39:06 - then this was probably
39:09 - confusing
39:14 - there we go there's a timer
39:16 - all right i'm gonna scroll up to the top
39:18 - and and try to get through as many
39:19 - questions and comments as i can if i
39:22 - don't get your question or comment
39:23 - during this five minute break i will uh
39:26 - most likely get to it in the next one
39:28 - at the end of the stream i'll get to all
39:30 - the comments and questions so just be
39:32 - patient if you can't stick around you
39:34 - can always check out the recording of
39:35 - this uh later on it'll be available on
39:38 - this channel the free code camp youtube
39:40 - channel
39:45 - um
39:47 - samir asks uh hi jesse i'm new to react
39:50 - where can i start
39:53 - um you can always check out the official
39:55 - react documentation like on the react
39:58 - website
39:59 - uh it's not bad i remember when i was
40:01 - first just new and started reading it it
40:03 - was over my head but they do have some
40:05 - beginner
40:06 - tutorials on there
40:09 - so depending on how good you already are
40:10 - with javascript you may do better with
40:13 - that than i did
40:16 - free code camp has a beta curriculum
40:18 - that you can preview and work on
40:21 - they have some react lessons on there i
40:23 - have not gone through them myself
40:25 - but i see other people on twitter have
40:28 - you know talked about going through them
40:31 - so they seem to be good
40:33 - uh
40:34 - code academy has an in-browser react
40:37 - course
40:39 - and i'm trying to think what else
40:44 - i think those are the main resources if
40:46 - you want to spend money on a course i
40:48 - did go through the
40:51 - udacity react nanodegree
40:53 - if you want to know more about that
40:55 - check out my channel i did do a short
40:57 - video of what my review of that
41:00 - nanodegree program so
41:02 - i'm not going to go over it again since
41:04 - i already have that available but you
41:05 - you can check that out the link to my
41:07 - channel is in the description for this
41:09 - video
41:11 - uh so that's where i would start out now
41:14 - uh if there are also some videos on this
41:16 - channel
41:18 - that go over you know react basics
41:20 - so you could check those out as well and
41:22 - you're more than welcome to watch these
41:24 - streams and i'll do my best to explain
41:26 - everything be sure to ask a lot of
41:28 - questions uh because i'll
41:31 - answer as much as i i possibly can
41:48 - let's see
41:50 - viconius says why programmers haven't
41:53 - got girls
41:55 - i
41:57 - i i have a wife so
42:00 - i'm a programmer and i have a wife so
42:02 - i'm not sure i'm not sure why other
42:04 - programmers might not have them i don't
42:06 - really know i mean
42:08 - i don't know that there's anything
42:10 - inherent to programmers that would make
42:11 - them not have growth i think it's just
42:13 - like a joke
42:15 - um
42:17 - i guess if you spend all your time
42:19 - inside programming then
42:22 - you might be a lot more pale than people
42:24 - like maybe i don't know
42:27 - i'm just messing around now i don't
42:28 - really know
42:29 - um the ninja says in reply says who
42:32 - jesse has a house full of hot shakes
42:35 - that's not
42:37 - i would say singular one hot chick my
42:40 - wife is very hot so
42:42 - i don't have a household i just have one
42:45 - and then uh
42:46 - i do have daughters but
42:48 - uh
42:49 - nobody say that they're they're hot
42:51 - don't talk about my daughters like that
42:54 - my daughters
42:56 - are six and one and a half so
42:59 - uh there's still
43:01 - tiny little people right now
43:05 - um
43:07 - let's see
43:14 - all right there's a lot of comments
43:16 - about the stream whenever it was lagging
43:20 - king mobile says hi to all hey how's it
43:22 - going thanks for watching
43:36 - uh superman says can you give me your
43:38 - opinion on vue.js
43:41 - i i have not used view
43:44 - i haven't even really seen tutorials
43:46 - about vue
43:47 - but i've seen a lot of people who i
43:50 - developers who i do respect that respect
43:52 - their opinion i think they're good
43:53 - developers and they really like vue
43:56 - so
43:57 - my opinion on it now
44:00 - is just
44:01 - i've heard good things about it it seems
44:03 - like it's a good framework
44:06 - so if you want to give it a shot i say
44:07 - go for it
44:09 - i'd like to try it out at some point but
44:10 - i don't have any plans to do it right
44:12 - now i i think that i'm still not
44:15 - where i want to be with my skills and
44:17 - react so the limited time that i have to
44:19 - be able to
44:21 - you know put into
44:23 - kind of training and studying more
44:25 - i'm going to put into react right now
44:28 - and you know maybe one day i'll go with
44:30 - you
44:30 - but i don't have anything against you i
44:32 - haven't to be honest with you i haven't
44:33 - heard anything negative about view it's
44:35 - all been good stuff
44:38 - so if anybody has used view uh would
44:41 - like to put your opinion in uh please
44:44 - put in the live chat now if you're
44:45 - watching the recording later on uh go
44:47 - ahead and put it in the comments and i
44:50 - think that would be helpful for anybody
44:51 - that's you know wondering about you if
44:53 - somebody who's actually used it would
44:55 - weigh in
44:56 - preferably somebody that's use you and
44:58 - react to give uh maybe a comparison
45:02 - all right so my five minute timer is up
45:04 - i'm going to jot down quickly where i
45:06 - left off in the live chat help me get
45:08 - back to it after our
45:10 - our next session
45:26 - all right
45:34 - oh hey i just noticed
45:36 - like 10 minutes ago quincy stopped in
45:39 - i'm not sure if he's still here so
45:42 - but if you are hey quincy thanks for the
45:44 - retweet
45:46 - i appreciate that
45:50 - yo if you don't know who quincy is he's
45:52 - the the founder and head of free code
45:54 - camp so
45:56 - i wouldn't be doing this stream here if
45:57 - it weren't for quincy
45:59 - and uh so i always appreciate when
46:02 - quincy stops in it's always exciting
46:05 - and go ahead and follow quincy on on
46:07 - twitter if you want to find out
46:09 - everything that's going on with free
46:10 - code cam uh he's always
46:12 - always tweeting about all the different
46:14 - things they're doing so that's so much
46:16 - going on here free code camp now
46:18 - um you know we've had the forum for a
46:20 - long time
46:21 - we have the youtube we have two youtube
46:23 - channels now one for talks and one you
46:26 - know this channel that we're on
46:28 - and um
46:30 - have a medium publication with blogs of
46:33 - a podcast now
46:35 - the new beta curriculum is being worked
46:37 - on and is going to come out soon
46:40 - i'm probably missing some other things
46:42 - that we're doing but there's just so
46:43 - much with free code cam uh so if you if
46:47 - you haven't checked out the rest of what
46:49 - is there then
46:50 - you know please please check it out
46:52 - there's so much more
46:54 - and better stuff than than just what i'm
46:56 - doing here on the stream
47:02 - all right so
47:04 - one problem that we had before we
47:06 - stopped is that when we put more than
47:08 - one collapsible item in here
47:10 - right now the way we have it set up they
47:12 - both
47:14 - open and close the same time
47:16 - so we need to fix that but first we're
47:18 - going to clean some stuff up
47:20 - so we've extracted out
47:23 - all the the code we need to make one of
47:26 - these these elements click and
47:29 - everything below it included
47:32 - and we've extracted that out into its
47:33 - own component
47:36 - and
47:37 - we're not
47:38 - we don't have everything uh ready yet we
47:40 - see we still have some little red
47:41 - squiggly lines which means we have
47:43 - errors mainly these aren't defined
47:46 - so we need to define
47:52 - let's see
47:59 - a stylus theme
48:04 - i'm wondering if any of these had to do
48:06 - with your image form control nested
48:13 - i think nested
48:17 - yeah we need to pull the nested clasp
48:19 - but i don't think we'll need any of the
48:21 - other ones
48:25 - so let's bring this in now
48:28 - and then we'll remove what we don't need
48:42 - let's double check
48:47 - yeah that was the only place we were
48:49 - using classes
48:53 - and we need to bring in also
49:02 - dance classes
49:03 - we're open
49:16 - oops
49:17 - a new version of java is available i do
49:20 - not want java
49:22 - run me later
49:24 - why do i still have a java on my
49:25 - computer anyway
49:27 - anyway it popped up on my other screen
49:31 - um
49:39 - i think the open
49:40 - referred to the drawer yeah it did so we
49:43 - don't need open
49:44 - we don't need toggle drawer
49:46 - let's just bring in classes
49:49 - wonderful and style so all right so now
49:52 - we have everything that we need
49:56 - and we may be able to get rid of this
50:02 - let's get rid of this
50:05 - and see
50:10 - that's this in that list item
50:15 - all right great we can get rid of this
50:19 - this was just that
50:21 - that second one we brought in
50:36 - okay
50:37 - so that shortened up our component a
50:39 - little bit
50:45 - nice we may even pull this out at some
50:47 - point i'm okay with it there for now
50:52 - this is that
50:53 - search uh so this is our logo at the top
50:56 - and this is that search input
51:01 - so that's what we're talking about so
51:02 - you see everything below it now has been
51:04 - taken out
51:06 - so first let's just try to put this back
51:09 - in and see
51:11 - if it
51:12 - if it works oh no we didn't have
51:15 - we need this toggle drawer
51:27 - all right we will have to pass toggle
51:29 - drawer down
51:32 - so let's put that back in here
51:37 - toggle drawer and
51:40 - what we call the other one
51:47 - right now it's handle click but we don't
51:49 - want it to be called handle click right
51:50 - we want it to be
51:54 - open
51:56 - item
52:04 - all right yeah we're going to call it
52:06 - open item
52:34 - all right so we have
52:36 - our handle click is now going to be
52:43 - actually our handle click is going to
52:44 - get passed down as a prop from our
52:46 - layout
52:47 - right i'm you know i'm going to check
52:49 - the live chat so i i
52:52 - if you have any questions put them in
52:53 - the live chat i'm going to do a better
52:55 - job of checking back in there to make
52:57 - sure that i'm not losing you feel free
53:00 - to ask questions i'm just gonna really
53:04 - quickly scan through
53:05 - the last few comments
53:16 - turn
53:28 - okay rook says uh that handle click
53:31 - function please change that set state
53:33 - call to the function version
53:42 - uh okay so rooker we're talking about
53:46 - this handle click
53:51 - just to be sure if it's this one uh just
53:54 - let me know that i have the right one
53:56 - this this may be the only one that we've
53:58 - seen
54:00 - but we're actually going to take this
54:02 - out completely from here
54:05 - and we're going to move it up to layout
54:09 - let me grab that we may have done it did
54:11 - we do it already
54:14 - i think we did
54:17 - x
54:18 - expand menu
54:20 - is that what we did
54:22 - we did i went over here and i called it
54:24 - expand menu
54:46 - all right so rook is saying
54:49 - there's a
54:51 - recommended way to update the state
54:53 - based on previous state
54:55 - and so let's
54:58 - let's do that
55:02 - let's set states
55:06 - let's do that here
55:09 - just to show um
55:11 - if you can't see the live chat now
55:13 - i'll kind of type it out for you
55:16 - so
55:17 - this is our previous state
55:22 - and
55:24 - so we can
55:26 - we're going to pass in our previous
55:28 - state
55:31 - and
55:33 - we can
55:35 - update our object so then we would put
55:38 - what open
55:44 - let's see if we've called previously
55:46 - this parameter you can say so our open
55:48 - items is going to be
56:04 - this would be the same name
56:12 - so we do it like this open items equals
56:32 - would need to be something like this
56:35 - and rook's explaining
56:39 - this avoids issues with set state being
56:42 - asynchronous and batching
56:45 - set state calls by default
56:50 - okay great
56:52 - open item preview save on all right
56:54 - awesome so this was uh
56:56 - the correct yeah this is the correct way
56:59 - thanks rook
57:00 - uh i appreciate
57:02 - i appreciate you pointing that out
57:04 - that's cool yeah i um
57:08 - i knew that we could get the previous
57:10 - state i'd never used it before
57:12 - i didn't realize that there was
57:14 - a better performance with this
57:17 - so i'm glad i'll try to keep this in
57:19 - mind and use it it'll probably take me a
57:20 - while before i'm used to this way
57:23 - but i will try to use it
57:26 - uh would it would this way be the best
57:28 - way just by default
57:30 - oh no what did i do
57:33 - would this be the best way by default
57:35 - or should i stick with kind of the
57:37 - normal way unless i
57:41 - i was already using it up here
57:43 - i i probably didn't write this uh one of
57:45 - you probably wrote this and
57:47 - i just merged the pull request but
57:50 - i didn't realize i was already using it
57:54 - uh also i don't need these parens
57:57 - parentheses here
58:10 - same thing just avoids issues when you
58:12 - change database on previous date okay
58:14 - cool
58:15 - um so i will
58:18 - do my best to learn this way and keep
58:20 - using it
58:23 - all right so
58:24 - let me say this expand menu
58:30 - you know what i want to say expand item
58:34 - i think i like that better
58:40 - because really it's a menu item it
58:42 - happens to have a sub menu inside it but
58:46 - i think i like item better since we're
58:48 - calling this a drawer item
58:51 - all right x
58:53 - expand
58:55 - expand item
59:12 - um
59:34 - let's see
59:46 - oh okay rook says you also get access to
59:48 - props in that function as a second
59:50 - argument uh it's not used in a handler
59:52 - right now all right cool that's useful
59:59 - all right so right now
60:02 - the expanding
60:05 - uh and collapsing is was handled
60:09 - in our drawer
60:11 - by
60:12 - state
60:12 - we had open items
60:15 - so what we're going to do now is
60:18 - all right let's do it like this
60:21 - state
60:23 - equals
60:29 - open items
60:33 - why is that defaulted to true
60:44 - you think you'd want it to be defaulted
60:46 - to false right
60:48 - i wanted false
60:51 - maybe just for an example we had it
60:52 - defaulted to true all right so i'm going
60:54 - to put that in here
60:56 - but then
60:58 - i'm going to do a um
61:10 - yeah
61:11 - that's how we'll do it
61:17 - wait a second
61:37 - i just confused myself okay
61:41 - let me explain what i was what i'm
61:43 - thinking here why just confuse myself
61:47 - so our problem was we had both opening
61:49 - at the same time both items would open
61:52 - and close at the same time so my
61:54 - solution i was thinking is let's
61:56 - separate it out into another component
61:58 - let's handle state and that component
62:00 - and then each component
62:02 - each expandable menu would handle its
62:04 - own state and that would work but
62:07 - the problem is that we also need to be
62:09 - able to change the state of that item
62:11 - from another component
62:13 - it's going to be
62:16 - our our app bar component
62:21 - so that that was the issue
62:44 - so it's easy to do it in here if all the
62:46 - states internal the hard part is getting
62:48 - the click to work
62:56 - all right we'll take it one step at a
62:58 - time let's break it down first let's
63:00 - just get this to work
63:02 - we're going to pretend right now like we
63:04 - don't have to do the other step and
63:05 - that'll just simplify things we'll get
63:07 - it to work
63:08 - then we can go to step 2 and figure out
63:12 - how to
63:13 - change the state
63:15 - from outside this component
63:20 - all right so
63:22 - what we'll do then is
63:32 - drawer
63:45 - all right so for now we know we're not
63:46 - going to keep it in here but for now
63:48 - let's just put this in here just to make
63:50 - sure that
63:52 - uh we haven't messed anything up when we
63:55 - move this component over so we should
63:57 - save that that should work
64:00 - and then
64:07 - here we're going to
64:12 - add in
64:14 - let's see
64:16 - bringing in components oops
64:19 - yeah and drawer we are right
64:31 - sorry i'm thinking out loud a bit
64:35 - i've been working so much with the
64:37 - importing data and things i haven't
64:39 - actually worked with react components
64:41 - like this for
64:43 - for a while probably like definitely
64:45 - before before christmas
64:48 - all right so we're going to import
64:51 - drawer item
64:55 - and
64:56 - it's in the same folder
64:58 - so we just need to do
65:01 - dot slash
65:03 - drawer item
65:05 - and then down here we can add a few
65:10 - drawer items to the bottom of our list
65:16 - draw item
65:18 - oops
65:27 - all right so we'll add three of them in
65:28 - there
65:29 - so you save that save that
65:31 - and
65:32 - let's see
65:33 - oops
65:38 - i guess those colors are right
65:41 - i think my colors are a little off from
65:43 - what i used to use in my other editor
65:47 - so sometimes i think i have errors and i
65:49 - really don't
66:00 - all right let's see
66:02 - oops
66:04 - i didn't want to save this yet
66:08 - all right
66:12 - i gotta accidentally save that
66:18 - no
66:33 - all right cool
66:36 - all right so it still opens
66:41 - no
66:43 - all right so our clicks don't
66:44 - work all right i'm glad we um we tried
66:48 - this out
66:49 - first because
66:52 - we did something and the clicks don't
66:54 - even work
66:58 - all right so let's take a look
67:00 - at our drawer item
67:03 - so we do have a state the state's open
67:05 - items
67:08 - oops pretty state open
67:12 - items that's probably our problem
67:20 - no
67:23 - okay so i thought that was the problem
67:25 - because we
67:26 - were trying to change something in state
67:30 - this thing previously open items
67:32 - all right that looks fine
67:38 - let's try out
67:40 - expand item
67:48 - oh expand
67:50 - yeah expand item
67:55 - oh that's right we don't
67:57 - this isn't in props right now and then
68:03 - where's our on click
68:11 - yeah our on click should say this
68:18 - expand item
68:29 - all right so there we go now it works
68:32 - and since each component
68:34 - is handling its own state
68:38 - then they open
68:42 - independently
68:43 - awesome
68:44 - okay so that works uh the reason it
68:46 - didn't work
68:47 - at first was because
68:51 - one i wasn't even changing the right
68:54 - state i was
68:55 - i just had the word open here i didn't
68:57 - have open items so that was a problem
68:59 - and then also our on click
69:02 - was trying to call a function called
69:04 - handleclick which didn't even exist
69:07 - because we changed the name to expand
69:08 - item so those are the
69:10 - the two issues
69:15 - alright so now that that works
69:19 - let's take the next step
69:22 - and see if we can
69:25 - when we click one of these have this
69:27 - open and then have a change so i'd say
69:29 - the first step is
69:30 - let's just
69:32 - make it so that when we click one of
69:33 - these
69:34 - the drawer opens
69:36 - we'll try to do that we'll test that if
69:38 - that works then we'll move on and try to
69:40 - do this and we'll see how much time we
69:42 - have i want to commit this right now
69:45 - since we've kind of got to a point where
69:48 - things are stable and they work
69:50 - and it is an improvement over what we
69:52 - had we're not all the way there yet but
69:54 - i think this is a good point to commit
69:58 - um
70:00 - i'm going to do a git add
70:04 - so what i just did was i added any new
70:07 - files
70:08 - um
70:10 - and basically added any files
70:13 - uh
70:14 - to be ready to be committed and then i'm
70:16 - going to do git commit m which means
70:19 - just i'm going to put my commit message
70:21 - in that's what the m
70:22 - does
70:24 - and i'm going to say
70:27 - create
70:39 - create your item component
70:42 - that's pretty much what we did
70:44 - all right now it's going to run through
70:46 - all our tests so if you want to
70:48 - contribute to the project
70:51 - we got hit with these this is i'm glad
70:53 - this kind of hap this happened like this
70:55 - so if you want to contribute to the
70:56 - project when you go to commit
70:59 - which i encourage anyone who wants to
71:01 - contribute please do especially if you
71:02 - haven't contributed to a project before
71:04 - in github
71:05 - the projects we do on the stream i think
71:07 - are a great chance for you to just get
71:09 - started so i'm not going to get upset if
71:11 - you
71:12 - do a pull request and it's
71:14 - it doesn't work
71:16 - i'll try to help you through it if you
71:18 - have any questions let me know
71:20 - i've had
71:21 - a handful of people submit their first
71:24 - pull request
71:25 - on the things that we work on in the
71:27 - stream and i'm always really happy when
71:29 - that happens so if you want to submit a
71:31 - pr
71:32 - let me know if you need help i'm here to
71:34 - help you but if you do on pretty much
71:37 - all our projects we have some automated
71:39 - testing and linting and formatting
71:42 - so
71:43 - a lot of what you see here is is that
71:45 - going on
71:46 - but i messed up so it's not going to let
71:49 - me commit until i fix this
71:51 - so let's fix it and run it again and
71:54 - it's going to check everything and make
71:55 - sure i did it right
71:57 - this is kind of a good like safety net
72:00 - so that
72:01 - code that obviously doesn't work doesn't
72:04 - get into the project it makes it a
72:06 - little bit easier for me to review the
72:08 - pull requests because there's certain
72:10 - things i know are already going to be
72:12 - there and i don't have to check on
72:15 - so
72:16 - let's see where we're at so it tells us
72:18 - now it's eslint has found some errors so
72:20 - these are basically um
72:23 - like
72:24 - errors that break the rules of es land
72:26 - so obviously these errors haven't caused
72:29 - our application to crash
72:31 - but we don't want this kind of stuff in
72:33 - our code we want it cleaned up
72:35 - so we have some
72:37 - some things that we've defined but never
72:39 - used so we don't want to do that
72:42 - so let's find out where it's at
72:44 - they're all in this drawer.js component
72:47 - so we only have to look in one place
72:49 - which is good and it tells us exactly
72:51 - exactly where
72:52 - they all are
72:54 - so let's check it out line by line i'm
72:56 - going to shrink this a little bit so we
72:57 - can see
72:58 - this is our drawer.js component let's go
73:01 - up here and we have lines 6 seven eight
73:03 - and nine
73:05 - so on line six
73:07 - and it's actually highlighting it here
73:08 - in red
73:10 - so if i would have been more careful and
73:11 - checked before i tried to commit we
73:13 - would have seen it
73:14 - but let's get rid of that list item
73:16 - since we're not using it anymore
73:18 - and these are all things that we took
73:20 - out and moved over to this component
73:22 - that's why we don't need them anymore
73:25 - and now i'm just going to get rid of
73:27 - all these lines
73:30 - and
73:30 - save okay i can verify that everything's
73:34 - still working by going back to my
73:35 - project
73:38 - all right great it still works and now
73:41 - i don't have to type everything in again
73:43 - i'm just going to hit the up arrow key
73:44 - on my keyboard and it brings up that
73:47 - last message that git commit message
73:49 - this will save you a lot of time i was
73:51 - talking to somebody yesterday who didn't
73:53 - know about that on the command line and
73:55 - it's always great when you first learn
73:57 - about that
73:58 - and also the autocomplete
74:01 - like if you hit tab it auto completes
74:03 - when you first learn about that it like
74:05 - changes your world it was so cool to see
74:07 - somebody
74:08 - like learn that
74:10 - for the first time
74:12 - so i'm gonna hit enter again it's going
74:13 - to run through our tests
74:15 - let's make it a bit bigger
74:18 - there we go so
74:19 - i made it through
74:21 - prettier which auto formats i made it
74:23 - through eslint which that's what i got
74:25 - caught at the last time now it's
74:27 - actually running tests so it's opening
74:29 - up
74:30 - a browser it's loading the page and
74:32 - checking to make sure certain elements
74:34 - are actually on the page so you can't
74:36 - see it now the browser opened up on my
74:38 - other screen
74:40 - but it actually i just saw all these
74:42 - tabs open in the browser and different
74:44 - pages in the site load you don't have to
74:46 - have it open up uh there's some options
74:49 - you can run it so you don't see it
74:51 - but
74:52 - you can see it checked our faculty page
74:54 - we don't have tests for all our pages
74:56 - yet
74:57 - that's one of the areas where maybe i
74:59 - should make some issues in the github
75:01 - repo anybody that really wants to write
75:03 - the test feel free
75:05 - but we did test we tested three pages
75:08 - our faculty
75:09 - and it says uh
75:11 - this page can be seen at
75:14 - this ura faculty sum id
75:17 - so whatever id we want to test
75:19 - and it displays the correct data
75:22 - the index can be seen at the correct url
75:24 - which is the root
75:26 - and then page two can be seen at slash
75:28 - page
75:29 - right so
75:31 - we passed all our tests
75:34 - now we're ready to commit or ready to
75:36 - push this so we're going to get push
75:39 - origin
75:41 - and we could type in master here since
75:43 - we want to push it to the master branch
75:45 - but we don't have to we can just use the
75:46 - shorthand hit enter it'll automatically
75:49 - push to master i do need to put in my id
75:52 - since i restarted my computer earlier
75:55 - so let me
75:56 - on my other screen here i'm going to
75:57 - open up
75:59 - lastpass
76:00 - if you're not using a password manager
76:02 - like lastpass i do recommend it
76:05 - that way you can use super long
76:07 - ridiculous passwords and you don't have
76:09 - to remember them you have to remember
76:11 - one your super long ridiculous lastpass
76:13 - password
76:15 - but then
76:16 - all your other ones are covered
76:18 - hmm for some reason
76:23 - lastpass is not opening
76:31 - what did i do
76:36 - all right let me try to open in a
76:37 - different window
76:39 - no
76:51 - all right let me go to this
76:57 - last
77:12 - okay rook says you don't even have to
77:14 - use get push origin you can just use get
77:17 - push and that will work that's really
77:19 - cool i didn't know that
77:21 - um
77:22 - i'm gonna have to log into the desktop
77:24 - version of lastpass since my
77:26 - extension isn't working my chrome
77:28 - extension
77:31 - when i was shutting down clone chrome
77:33 - windows before uh from the task manager
77:36 - in chrome
77:38 - maybe i accidentally did something that
77:40 - messed up lastpass i don't know
77:43 - um
77:44 - actually
77:49 - maybe i just go to the chrome extensions
77:51 - page
77:54 - after i just gave this big uh
77:56 - deal on
77:59 - everybody used lastpass and now it
78:00 - doesn't work
78:20 - hmm
78:25 - i can open up the options for lastpass i
78:27 - just can't open last
78:47 - oh well
78:56 - uh harshit says are you in lastpass
78:57 - premium i am in lastpass premium i could
79:00 - just open it on my phone and type in the
79:02 - password i guess
79:05 - let me do that
79:06 - i was just trying to get out of typing
79:08 - in that big password but
79:11 - hello um
79:36 - all right
79:38 - let me type this in now
80:05 - all right that should work
80:07 - what
80:15 - no
80:17 - all right well let's try to just type
80:18 - get push
80:22 - let me try to type it again maybe i did
80:24 - it wrong
80:44 - yeah it worked this time
80:47 - awesome
80:50 - sorry for the uh the delay okay
80:53 - so
80:56 - that's that's there and that's push to
80:57 - get up so you all can see all the code
80:59 - that we just did you can check it out
81:00 - yourself
81:02 - you can clone the project
81:04 - contribute use it for whatever you want
81:08 - everything's totally
81:10 - open source
81:12 - we use the mit license you can do
81:14 - whatever you want
81:15 - uh i will say like the obviously the
81:18 - logo doesn't fall under that right
81:21 - that's the university's logo um and then
81:23 - like university images but
81:26 - the code itself is mit
81:30 - all right let me
81:31 - let me set my five minute timer i'm
81:33 - gonna go through some questions and then
81:35 - figure out whether or not we want to
81:36 - continue with this and try to get some
81:38 - more to work or maybe we want to save
81:40 - that for tomorrow's stream
81:43 - so if you have an opinion about that let
81:45 - me know
81:47 - i know
81:48 - it can be a long time to watch a stream
81:51 - we've been going for almost an hour and
81:53 - a half now
81:54 - so let me know if you'd rather have me
81:56 - split it up and do some today and some
81:57 - tomorrow or just do it all today
82:18 - uh let's see dinesh asks are you a react
82:22 - developer
82:24 - i guess so
82:25 - um
82:27 - i mean officially i'm a front end
82:29 - developer and i do a lot of react stuff
82:32 - so i think it would be accurate to say
82:34 - i'm a react developer
82:37 - if anyone disagrees with that let me
82:38 - know
82:39 - i'm not really sure what qualifies i'm
82:41 - going to be a react developer but i
82:43 - develop things with react
82:49 - all right john hanson says so i should
82:51 - mostly pass up with props in the
82:54 - functional uh dumb components
82:57 - uh if a component view container needs
83:01 - state to make it standalone component
83:03 - then let them hold their own functions
83:07 - um let me read that again
83:11 - that's props
83:15 - yeah so your your stateless functional
83:17 - components definitely just do props
83:20 - right they're not going to have state
83:32 - yeah so if you need a
83:36 - if you need something to have its own
83:38 - state you can put the functions in there
83:40 - like we did with these list items all
83:42 - right now obviously
83:43 - either later today or tomorrow we're
83:45 - gonna have to deal with the other things
83:46 - that we wanted to do
83:48 - and it may need to change but for now
83:50 - that was the simplest way to get the
83:52 - behavior that we wanted that each
83:54 - component handles its own state
83:58 - john hanson says jesse is a react king
84:02 - i don't know about that
84:04 - uh i'd be happy if i was like
84:07 - i don't know a react duke what are all
84:10 - the titles of royalty right maybe i'm
84:12 - down a little lower
84:14 - um
84:16 - dinesh says
84:18 - as i can
84:20 - see on both the screens you might be
84:22 - working on html and some js framework is
84:26 - that correct which framework is of
84:28 - javascript is it uh it is react so we
84:31 - are using react
84:36 - all right
84:51 - all right let me uh so quincy was in the
84:53 - chat a little while ago and uh quincy
84:55 - did say we're just getting started
84:56 - exciting things in the pipes for
84:59 - 2018. so that's cool i'm excited to see
85:03 - what what happens
85:05 - so i'm not in the loop with all the
85:06 - secret free code camp new stuff coming
85:09 - out so i'm just as excited as any of you
85:11 - might be
85:13 - um
85:14 - let's see
85:18 - let's see
85:24 - let me know if i mispronounced that but
85:26 - anyway they say hey i was making a
85:28 - twitter clone with react.js and material
85:31 - you lie but i couldn't get the twitter's
85:34 - navigation icons like home icon etc how
85:38 - do i get those icons
85:40 - hmm
85:45 - with an ad like
85:47 - icon is like for twitter no
85:50 - i accidentally closed out my
85:53 - my youtube window
86:17 - so i always wondered if my stream would
86:18 - still work if i closed out of youtube
86:22 - and it looks like it did still work
86:27 - let me know did the stream stop at all
86:30 - like a few seconds ago
86:47 - see
86:57 - all right i'm trying to look at the the
86:58 - bottom of the live chat and see if it
87:01 - stops
87:10 - all right cool
87:11 - that was really weird uh so i
87:13 - accidentally closed the tab and now it
87:15 - says that it looks like my stream has
87:17 - restarted
87:18 - from my
87:20 - admin screen
87:23 - because it's saying i've only been
87:24 - streaming for one minute
87:26 - but based on what you are telling me i
87:29 - guess it didn't stop at all
87:31 - i'm just worried because i don't want
87:32 - there to be two videos
87:35 - of this this stream later on
87:38 - uh so as long as that doesn't happen i
87:39 - think it's it's okay uh so anyway the
87:42 - question was about the icons for twitter
87:45 - so the reason i accidentally closed my
87:46 - windows because i was going to open a
87:47 - new tab and look at the twitter icons
87:50 - so i could better answer the question
87:52 - and i accidentally closed out
87:55 - youtube
87:57 - um
87:58 - i don't know where you would get the
88:00 - icons for twitter
88:02 - they may not be available for public use
88:05 - so i would just be careful about that
88:07 - uh you could certainly get some icons
88:10 - that would
88:11 - do that like you have a there's a home
88:12 - icon right you could probably find a
88:15 - little icon of a house somewhere it
88:17 - might not be exactly what's on twitter
88:19 - but i would just be careful
88:21 - to find out if you're allowed to use the
88:23 - twitter icons or not
88:26 - and i mean you may be able
88:31 - i don't know if you'd be able to check
88:33 - in the code if they would
88:35 - have a comment somewhere in there or
88:36 - even
88:39 - i don't know if these are svgs or what
88:45 - i just
88:46 - just opened devtools to see
88:51 - oh it looks like a font icon
88:57 - all right so
88:58 - twitter's using i guess their own font
89:00 - icon set for that
89:04 - so maybe do a search for twitter font
89:06 - icons
89:12 - all right
89:13 - um
89:15 - my time's up i'm just i'm going to go
89:17 - down through
89:19 - how about we'll do this i'm going to go
89:20 - down through i'm going to answer all the
89:21 - questions and everything once we get to
89:23 - the end
89:24 - i'm gonna see how i feel how tired i am
89:27 - streaming takes a lot out of you um it
89:30 - really realistically i'm just sitting
89:32 - here talking and typing but like
89:34 - mentally
89:35 - it's draining to try to focus on the
89:38 - code and the live chat and talk
89:40 - so i might not be up for doing more code
89:43 - after this but there's a lot in the live
89:44 - chat so i want to make sure i get to all
89:46 - your questions we can always finish what
89:48 - we're doing here tomorrow
89:54 - let me check
90:06 - all right stephen says uh jesse just a
90:09 - quick question having a hard time
90:10 - learning javascript any ideas on what i
90:12 - should do i get the concepts just not
90:14 - how to use it
90:16 - um maybe
90:18 - if you need a little help about how to
90:19 - use it maybe check out some
90:22 - like practical projects that use it
90:25 - maybe where they walk you through some
90:27 - of it
90:28 - so
90:29 - maybe like a video where it walks
90:31 - through making a or an actual project
90:33 - would be good
90:35 - and then
90:37 - maybe you could go along with the video
90:39 - like type things out along with the
90:40 - video
90:42 - or
90:43 - you know then go from watching the video
90:45 - to trying to do it on your own in your
90:47 - own way something like that might help
90:49 - you make the connection between
90:51 - you know being able to do like some of
90:53 - the algorithm challenges to actually
90:55 - being able to build things on your own
90:57 - so i know there are some videos
91:00 - on this channel
91:02 - i know beau has some videos and some
91:04 - other people have videos on actually
91:06 - making projects step by step uh that use
91:09 - javascript
91:11 - so maybe try one out
91:13 - some of them might be too advanced so
91:15 - just you know try a few of them out and
91:17 - see what you can do with it
91:20 - i that's probably the best way uh to do
91:23 - things right i think that's like natural
91:25 - learning for people
91:27 - even when we're little we learn by
91:29 - watching other people doing things and
91:30 - then we try it out ourselves so
91:33 - i think that's that's
91:35 - everybody's different but that might be
91:37 - a more natural way is to watch somebody
91:39 - else do it and then try it out as you
91:42 - get confident then you can do your thing
91:45 - and and be more creative with it
91:49 - so anyway i hope that advice works
91:51 - steven uh try it out if it doesn't you
91:54 - know come on back ask me again maybe
91:56 - something specific i could help you out
91:58 - with
91:58 - if if you need it
92:08 - let's see
92:15 - savage
92:17 - savage banana said pics of life or riot
92:21 - i said earlier
92:24 - let's talk about my wife earlier in the
92:26 - stream so
92:27 - um
92:31 - it wouldn't be that hard to figure out
92:32 - who my wife is um
92:35 - we uh follow each other and like each
92:38 - other's stuff on twitter and instagram
92:40 - and facebook
92:42 - so um
92:45 - if you really wanted to figure out who
92:46 - my wife is and find pictures you could
92:48 - find it i'm not going to share them with
92:50 - you but
92:51 - it's not like it's it's a secret
93:01 - let's see
93:08 - uh rick says catch you later have a
93:10 - meeting uh see you rick thanks for
93:12 - joining us good luck with your meeting
93:22 - oh okay we have a little bit more
93:23 - context on stephen's question earlier so
93:26 - um steven's working on the
93:29 - wikipedia viewer in the free code camp
93:32 - challenges and um just
93:35 - not getting it all to work together the
93:37 - right way
93:40 - um
93:42 - great and angel had an idea of um maybe
93:45 - ask someone in the free code camp
93:47 - community to do some peer programming it
93:50 - could help i i think that's a great idea
93:52 - that's even better than watching a video
93:55 - uh if you really need some some help you
93:57 - know one-on-one help
94:00 - i'm sure there's a there's some videos
94:02 - out there people actually building the
94:03 - wikipedia viewer
94:05 - i always have mixed feelings about that
94:07 - when i go through
94:08 - the free code camp challenges or
94:10 - anything like that i always like to try
94:13 - to do it on my own before i look at how
94:16 - anyone else did it uh especially i don't
94:19 - mind as much looking at the ui but
94:21 - looking at the code
94:23 - i'd rather not do it
94:26 - i suppose if i'm stuck on the same
94:28 - problem for a really long time it makes
94:30 - more sense to just look at how someone
94:32 - else did it but
94:35 - but having somebody else there with you
94:37 - to just help when you need it i think
94:39 - would be preferable
94:48 - um someone asked about my code editor it
94:51 - is visual studio code
94:55 - oh i do want to share some good news i
94:56 - don't know if this person wants this
94:58 - announced so i'm not going to say a name
95:00 - but somebody who frequently is in the
95:02 - live chat
95:04 - for these streams
95:05 - just got a developer job
95:07 - uh and told me about it
95:10 - within the last few days
95:12 - so really excited about that uh
95:15 - congratulations you know who you are
95:18 - uh if you're cool with me saying your
95:20 - name just let me know
95:21 - uh but anyway really excited that has
95:24 - happened you know several times now
95:26 - where you know someone who's watched the
95:27 - live chat
95:29 - uh was able to get a job
95:32 - it's always really cool when that
95:33 - happens so any good news like that you
95:36 - know if if you
95:37 - if you're comfortable sharing i'd love
95:39 - to hear about it as i get really excited
95:42 - about about stuff like that
95:44 - i think it's cool when like we all
95:47 - develop in our coding and you know our
95:49 - careers develop
95:51 - so
95:53 - anyway again congratulations just
95:55 - thought i'd share that with you all
95:58 - you know a little little inspiration if
95:59 - you are looking for a job now
96:02 - people are getting jobs i'm not saying
96:05 - that it has anything to do with my
96:06 - stream it'd be cool if it did but
96:10 - probably not
96:12 - but
96:12 - people are getting hired it happens
96:15 - keep at it and
96:17 - if you're looking for a job it'll happen
96:19 - just keep keep trying
96:27 - is
96:43 - uh stephen says do so how much
96:45 - javascript do i need to know before i
96:47 - should move to react my ultimate
96:50 - goal is to jump into react
96:54 - uh
96:55 - let's see
96:59 - and
97:00 - in response john says i went from jquery
97:03 - to javascript in about three months i'm
97:06 - doing fairly well with react after four
97:08 - months time
97:09 - yeah i would say
97:13 - i've heard people say that you should
97:16 - get really good with javascript before
97:18 - you go to react and i respectfully
97:21 - disagree with that opinion
97:23 - i think
97:24 - once you know enough javascript to
97:26 - understand the basics of react you're
97:28 - okay to go and do react
97:31 - you will get better with javascript as
97:33 - you do react you'll use different parts
97:35 - of javascript that you never use before
97:37 - when you do react
97:39 - the only thing i would warn against is
97:41 - don't just do react and forget about the
97:43 - rest of javascript actively try to learn
97:46 - more javascript because one day
97:49 - no one will use react
97:51 - probably not going to be anytime soon
97:53 - but at some point your career there'll
97:54 - probably be some other thing
97:56 - and it'll be a lot easier for you to go
97:58 - from react to the other thing
98:01 - assuming the other thing's javascript
98:02 - based which probably will be
98:05 - but it'll be a lot easier for you to go
98:07 - from react to the other thing if you
98:09 - have a good foundation in javascript
98:11 - so
98:13 - just to sum up my advice is
98:15 - go for react as soon as you can start
98:17 - understanding it
98:18 - but keep up your learning of vanilla
98:20 - javascript along the way
98:24 - all right let's see john hanson says
98:26 - awesome jesse a good example of
98:28 - troubleshooting and react thinking
98:30 - ah thanks i appreciate it i felt like
98:35 - i felt like i was in trouble there for a
98:37 - little bit
98:38 - and
98:39 - i kind of looked over and saw how many
98:41 - people are watching it's like ah
98:43 - all these people are gonna think i don't
98:44 - know what i'm doing
98:48 - but that's kind of the draw of the
98:49 - stream right uh to see me struggle
98:52 - through
98:54 - but i was rusty i felt really rusty
98:56 - doing react stuff i was just forgetting
98:58 - like simple things so
99:00 - that long like winter break just
99:03 - uh i i guess i forgot a lot more than i
99:06 - thought i did
99:08 - but that through it we did it helped
99:10 - once i try to break it up into smaller
99:12 - steps
99:14 - so that's
99:15 - good a good tip break things up into
99:17 - small steps one at a time
99:20 - you'll have
99:22 - logical places to do a commit and break
99:26 - it up
99:27 - and
99:29 - you feel less overwhelmed
99:35 - uh
99:38 - miss
99:40 - miss alex says i didn't understand
99:44 - um i'm not sure what you didn't
99:46 - understand if you're still watching
99:48 - could you let me know
99:50 - like more specifics about what you
99:51 - didn't understand i'd be happy to go
99:53 - back and explain something
99:55 - or you know go through a part of the
99:57 - code or anything you need
100:09 - uh rook says those error messages are
100:11 - nice they tell you the file the line and
100:13 - the character spot the column yeah for
100:16 - sure they're they're really nice saves a
100:19 - lot of time rook says is that link
100:21 - clickable the error link let's see
100:25 - uh
100:26 - where's this
100:28 - checker terminal
100:36 - so these aren't clickable but maybe
100:37 - you're talking about the error that
100:39 - comes up here
100:41 - let's try let me do something
100:43 - [Music]
100:45 - that gives me an airline
100:49 - i can't click on that pop-up
100:52 - maybe
100:56 - let me try to do
101:03 - do something like this
101:13 - all right it doesn't look like anything
101:15 - in here is clickable
101:18 - whoa
101:20 - oh that was the get i've never typed
101:23 - clicked on the the get thing all right
101:25 - i'm just going to get out of there
101:26 - because
101:28 - it's confusing me
101:30 - um
101:32 - change 101 let's get out of here
101:34 - it was just showing me the changes that
101:36 - i made all right cool
101:40 - anyway rook
101:41 - i don't know if i was trying to click
101:42 - the right thing but it didn't look like
101:44 - any of that stuff was was clickable
101:53 - you know what all this calculating stuff
101:56 - is not working right i wonder if
101:59 - some of my plugins in visual studio code
102:01 - are what's causing my computer
102:06 - to run
102:09 - maybe
102:13 - this plug-in is cool but i really don't
102:15 - need it maybe i should go in and shut
102:17 - off some of the stuff i don't really use
102:22 - all right i'll have to check on that
102:25 - just a thought
102:33 - so harsh it said
102:35 - yeah rook that's amazing so it is
102:37 - clickable i must have just been trying
102:38 - to click the wrong thing then huh
102:48 - uh
102:59 - how to get the terminal on visual studio
103:01 - code to look like in the video
103:04 - you know what
103:05 - i got these colors from udacity's
103:09 - intro to get in github
103:11 - course it's a free course check it out
103:14 - um
103:15 - i think they have two get courses now
103:18 - the older one was taught by two women
103:21 - so do that one if you want to know these
103:23 - colors
103:24 - and they gave some an example
103:27 - file to change all your colors for your
103:29 - terminal
103:30 - and i just took the example i didn't
103:31 - even really change it i just like the
103:33 - colors
103:34 - so that's where i got it from
103:36 - the git and github
103:39 - areas i think it's called intro to get
103:40 - in github
103:41 - on udacity it's one of their free
103:44 - courses
103:58 - so earlier i was talking about tests and
104:01 - writing tests for this and harshit says
104:03 - jesse you also haven't written a test
104:06 - yet with a little winking smiley face
104:09 - oh [ __ ] you are right
104:13 - oh man i just got called out
104:16 - yeah i have not written a test yet i i
104:18 - will say this i have slightly modified
104:21 - some existing tests
104:23 - not for this project but for previous
104:26 - ones
104:27 - but i haven't written one a test on my
104:29 - own so
104:31 - horseshit keeps me honest
104:33 - i didn't i didn't say i wrote a test i
104:36 - just encouraged everyone to write tests
104:41 - yeah so i need to learn more about
104:43 - writing tests myself
104:47 - and uh yeah harshit has i've done all
104:49 - the tests for this project so thank you
104:51 - for that
105:11 - okay oh um
105:13 - i guess so we used get push earlier that
105:15 - only works if you have set the tracking
105:18 - branch already
105:20 - so thanks uh harshit and angel for
105:24 - clarifying that
105:36 - my phone got the oreo update i hate
105:38 - these new emoji
105:44 - i don't remember what the emoji were
105:45 - like was like before the oreo update
105:49 - maybe that's better
105:52 - uh
105:53 - then i won't be bothered by the new ones
106:20 - uh all right so um
106:22 - o o u s s uh os
106:26 - let me know if i'm pronouncing that
106:28 - wrong i'm not really sure how to
106:29 - pronounce that but anyway
106:30 - they say can i tell you something i
106:32 - subscribe to your channel but i never
106:33 - watch your videos this is mainly because
106:35 - they look too advanced
106:38 - uh and the thumbnails do
106:40 - and uh miss a lot of fundamental stuff
106:42 - in my opinion
106:45 - um
106:47 - uh when i watch some of your tutorials
106:49 - uh you go too fast but i still watch
106:51 - some of your videos though i'm not
106:53 - really hating on your channel i respect
106:54 - what you do alright cool i appreciate um
106:57 - the constructive criticism uh yeah so
107:02 - i will say this
107:04 - if if i ever go too fast you're welcome
107:06 - to ask some questions ask me to go back
107:09 - i'm i'm happy to do that
107:10 - but also
107:12 - so the different videos on this channel
107:14 - on free code camp channel serve
107:16 - different purposes
107:17 - if you maybe want a more fundamental
107:19 - tutorial check out some of bose
107:22 - javascript videos
107:24 - i mean it depends on what you want to
107:25 - learn but for instance beau has a lot of
107:28 - basic level javascript all the way up to
107:30 - more advanced stuff
107:32 - this particular series live coding with
107:35 - jesse is not really a tutorial it's more
107:38 - of just showcasing my everyday work so i
107:41 - think the biggest benefit to this aside
107:43 - from the awesome community that we now
107:45 - have you know around this the show is
107:49 - that i mess things up frequently
107:52 - and then we get to work through them
107:54 - live so you kind of get an idea that
107:56 - usually in tutorials you don't have that
107:58 - happen they're well organized and things
108:00 - work
108:01 - whereas with this stream things don't
108:03 - work
108:04 - and we have to work at them often or
108:07 - sometimes we just have to make things
108:08 - work and it's like this is as good as
108:10 - it's going to get right now when we have
108:12 - to
108:13 - you know think of the trade-offs between
108:16 - doing it one way or another
108:18 - so not everything is perfect
108:20 - so
108:22 - that's it it makes sense that sometimes
108:25 - it seems like it goes too fast or we
108:27 - miss you know go skip over fundamental
108:29 - things
108:32 - uh so
108:33 - i still appreciate you saying that and
108:35 - like i said
108:36 - if you ever want me to explain anything
108:38 - more
108:39 - or go back and do something again let me
108:42 - know i'm happy to do that
108:44 - uh but again i i really appreciate you
108:46 - saying that and the way you said it was
108:48 - very respectful i
108:50 - i definitely appreciate that uh so thank
108:52 - you
109:01 - kamal says
109:03 - uh hey jesse you're doing great work
109:05 - please organize this tutorial in an
109:06 - organized manner react part and material
109:09 - ui part uh would be a great help
109:17 - um
109:20 - kamal says i mean make the react and
109:22 - material ui part uh combined playlist in
109:25 - an organized way
109:26 - uh okay um
109:31 - yeah let me
109:36 - i can probably separate out the
109:37 - tutorials in a better way
109:40 - right now
109:41 - i have like i say what project it's from
109:44 - so the title will say like this this one
109:46 - i think was
109:48 - p5d23 so it's project five day 23.
109:51 - what i will do
109:53 - and i know i've been saying i'm gonna do
109:54 - this and i just haven't really taken the
109:56 - time to is go through and separate every
109:58 - project out into its own playlist
110:01 - i hadn't thought about doing anything
110:02 - like this before but it's a possibility
110:05 - that potentially i could separate out
110:07 - certain topics into their own playlists
110:10 - as well
110:11 - i don't know
110:12 - that might be more confusing but i could
110:14 - do something like
110:16 - here's where we do just all back end
110:18 - stuff here's where we everything where i
110:21 - handle like
110:22 - sending emails from a server or file
110:25 - uploads so there are some things that we
110:27 - seem to be doing like every project
110:31 - that could be i don't know let me know
110:33 - what
110:34 - what do you think would be the best way
110:35 - to organize these i'm still going to
110:36 - have the one big playlist that's just
110:38 - live coding with jesse so you can see
110:40 - everything in one spot
110:42 - but i definitely think it would be good
110:43 - to have playlists for each project is
110:46 - there any other way that i should try to
110:48 - organize these as well
110:50 - i pro i can't go crazy with it because
110:51 - it's not my channel i share it so i
110:53 - don't want to make a million playlists
110:55 - but
110:56 - you know if there's any reasonable way
110:57 - to organize it i'm i'm definitely um
111:01 - open to suggestions
111:17 - okay
111:41 - all right blake's here hey blake how's
111:42 - it going
111:52 - oh okay so kamal said please make a
111:55 - playlist for react.js material ui
111:57 - combined i don't know where to start
111:59 - it's all messed up uh wordpress react
112:02 - node i want react.js only please make a
112:05 - specific playlist for that
112:07 - hmm
112:09 - all right yeah i'll have to think about
112:11 - how to do that
112:13 - because there are times when we switch
112:15 - back and forth so it may be a little bit
112:17 - hard to just isolate
112:19 - react because there are some streams
112:21 - where we'll do node react wordpress all
112:24 - of it in one stream
112:27 - uh sometimes it's hard to just stick to
112:29 - one one thing
112:32 - i'll keep that in mind and i'll i'll try
112:34 - to think about how i could organize them
112:36 - there are definitely some videos that
112:38 - are like obviously one thing or the
112:40 - other
112:41 - they could maybe go into a playlist
112:56 - john hanson says a pinch of clothes is
112:58 - great when making a slow cook stew yum
113:01 - i don't know where that
113:03 - i guess are you cooking john i don't
113:06 - maybe i missed something in the chat
113:09 - um
113:12 - oh says did i did he answer my question
113:14 - i was gone for a second i did answer
113:16 - your question
113:18 - i'm not sure you can always check the
113:20 - recording
113:25 - uh let's see
113:34 - oh umberto says i found out recently
113:36 - that our contract is getting renewed
113:38 - i have no idea for how long yet but
113:40 - hopefully that means i get to keep my
113:42 - job for a while longer umberto that's
113:44 - awesome
113:45 - really awesome
113:47 - um
113:50 - yeah so i mean i guess
113:53 - let me know
113:54 - let me know if you do get to keep it and
113:56 - if you're back in the market looking for
113:58 - job let me know too uh i'd be happy to
114:00 - like
114:01 - i don't know retweet stuff for you help
114:04 - you get some exposure
114:09 - savage banana says becca yeah that's
114:13 - uh yeah my wife's name is becca so i
114:15 - guess you did go and look it up on
114:17 - social media
114:20 - um
114:28 - all right cool
114:31 - harshit says all right we might be on to
114:33 - something now harshit said that that
114:35 - import cost plug-in is cpu intensive uh
114:39 - and it crashed um
114:42 - it crashed his computer once so remove
114:44 - import cost
114:45 - all right cool
114:46 - so uh either today or tomorrow i'm gonna
114:49 - try to run on 1080p
114:52 - with that plug-in gone and then see if
114:55 - it makes a difference
115:04 - let's see
115:14 - hershey said i messed up pronunciation
115:16 - of kamal sorry about that let me know
115:18 - how i'm supposed to pronounce it
115:19 - properly
115:20 - uh i really i do care about pronouncing
115:23 - uh everyone's name right so
115:25 - uh let me know don't be afraid to
115:27 - correct me if i if i ever say your name
115:29 - wrong
115:43 - all right so uh oh says
115:46 - um i think kamal is right when you
115:49 - organize your projects in their own
115:50 - playlist it would be more attractive and
115:52 - more inviting
115:53 - uh the thing is i'm a software engineer
115:55 - and worked with javascript a lot
115:58 - with but with the new es6 and the new
116:00 - things like babel and import and export
116:03 - and how that stuff works uh like
116:06 - that freaks me out
116:07 - sometimes or the observed thingies
116:10 - it's not that i don't understand
116:11 - javascript just the new things that
116:13 - javascript frameworks offered
116:15 - but if you have videos or tutorials
116:18 - where you group them in playlist they
116:20 - would be so much better in my opinion
116:23 - so i work mainly with c sharp and php
116:26 - okay cool that's good that's good to
116:28 - know thanks for the clarification
116:30 - um yeah so
116:32 - i would say
116:34 - probably it would be more
116:36 - like i can still look at maybe
116:38 - organizing things differently but
116:41 - i would
116:42 - i would say trying to maybe find some
116:44 - specific videos maybe in like bose
116:47 - javascript playlist
116:49 - that have to do do with es6 and some of
116:52 - the newer things might be more helpful
116:53 - to you
116:54 - and then if you want to still watch the
116:56 - stream which is awesome if you do
116:59 - it will help you to understand more of
117:00 - it and i'm still open answering any
117:02 - questions that you have as well
117:08 - nikola says it's it's kind of hard to
117:11 - give a name to a live stream because you
117:13 - don't know exactly what you will finish
117:15 - at the end yeah for sure
117:18 - the hardest part about live streaming is
117:20 - figuring out what title to give the
117:21 - videos
117:22 - no lie that's the hardest part
117:25 - because you're right i just never know
117:27 - sometimes i title a stream and then i
117:30 - don't even get it to work at all or
117:33 - we end up having like some bug and we
117:35 - fix that so
117:38 - that is the hardest part
117:42 - even if i did organize them in the
117:44 - playlist i'd probably still have some
117:45 - things that weren't right
117:48 - because of that because sometimes we
117:50 - just don't actually do what the title
117:51 - says we do and then i never go back and
117:53 - change it which i should
117:58 - uh all says i study now as a software
118:01 - architect and
118:03 - my sequel
118:04 - database and stuff anyways yeah
118:07 - that was that was it i think one more
118:10 - thing my pronoun my name is pronounced
118:12 - like
118:13 - us
118:14 - okay cool
118:16 - thank you for the pronunciation i'll do
118:18 - my best to try to remember that us
118:20 - us
118:22 - okay
118:23 - awesome
118:24 - uh john says yes cooking painting and
118:27 - thinking code soon off to the gym
118:29 - wow that's impressive cooking painting
118:31 - and thinking about code
118:34 - that's that's really impressive i um
118:38 - uh
118:39 - i don't know if i can handle all that at
118:41 - once and still
118:42 - you know not burn the food
118:49 - all right harsh it says to paste and see
118:53 - the pronunciation and translate
118:55 - all right cool let me do that right now
119:23 - come on
119:30 - all right
119:32 - i'm trying
119:33 - i'm trying to listen and get it right
119:37 - it's really like subtle
119:52 - all right i don't know i'm trying my
119:54 - best to get it right i'm having trouble
119:55 - with that one though
119:59 - um
120:00 - let's see
120:09 - let's see
120:10 - harshad said uh
120:12 - to john hanson i looked at your website
120:14 - your oil paintings are awesome they are
120:16 - awesome uh check out john's website if
120:19 - you're into artwork uh he's a really
120:21 - good artist
120:23 - and if you still haven't checked out his
120:24 - light bright react app on codepen check
120:28 - that out as well
120:29 - i tweeted about it
120:31 - last week or something so check out my
120:33 - twitter and scroll down a bit and you'll
120:35 - see a link to it
120:38 - um
120:44 - says thank you for answering my
120:45 - questions jesse you're welcome thanks
120:47 - for watching the stream and being so
120:48 - active in the chat i really appreciate
120:51 - it
120:51 - all right so i've gotten to the end of
120:53 - the live chat and
120:55 - i tell you what
120:57 - i think i'm gonna wait till tomorrow to
120:58 - finish up with with what we're doing
121:01 - uh cause i'm a little bit tired i'd like
121:03 - i'd like a little break like to get
121:05 - something to eat
121:06 - and
121:07 - also
121:08 - now it gives me a good title for the
121:11 - stream tomorrow because i can use the
121:13 - same title and just put part two
121:16 - so that
121:18 - that makes it a lot easier for me
121:21 - um oh yeah one more question vivek says
121:24 - bro tell me how
121:26 - can i do my best in python
121:29 - uh well i don't know a lot about python
121:32 - specifically i do like python i've used
121:34 - it a little bit
121:36 - but i can give you some general advice
121:39 - on how to how to do your best
121:41 - and uh i should make a video about this
121:43 - because i think i've said this
121:45 - you know a few times now in the stream
121:48 - at different times but
121:51 - when you're trying to learn any coding
121:52 - stuff
121:53 - python included
121:55 - uh when you your strategy for for
121:57 - learning more i think should be
122:00 - if you can break it up and learn a
122:02 - little bit every day
122:03 - that's so much better than maybe like
122:06 - let's say every saturday just doing all
122:08 - day on saturday
122:10 - your brain will when your brain's trying
122:12 - to learn something new it's trying to
122:13 - make these little pathways and
122:15 - connections right with with the neurons
122:17 - in your brain i'm not a scientist so if
122:20 - i'm not using the correct terms
122:23 - i mean it is what it is but
122:25 - uh
122:26 - the more you make pathways like think of
122:28 - um
122:29 - if you're taking a hike in the woods
122:31 - right
122:32 - if you walked over the grass every
122:34 - single day a little bit every day
122:37 - the the grass and everything would get
122:39 - beat down and there'd be a path
122:41 - if you only did it once a week it
122:43 - probably wouldn't wouldn't happen the
122:45 - grass would have enough time to grow up
122:47 - and so you wouldn't have that nice path
122:49 - it's the same way with your brain
122:51 - so that will help if you can do a little
122:52 - bit every day if you can do a lot every
122:54 - day it'll help even more
122:56 - but that's my my number one piece of
122:58 - advice when you're trying to learn
123:00 - something you'll retain the knowledge so
123:02 - much better and try to build on it right
123:04 - so when you learn one thing
123:06 - don't just move on to another concept
123:08 - and never use it again try to
123:10 - immediately apply what you learned to a
123:12 - project
123:14 - so do your tutorials but then try to
123:16 - have a project going at the same time
123:17 - and apply it that helps so much when i
123:20 - was learning react with udacity
123:23 - i would immediately use what i learned
123:25 - in udacity
123:26 - on my projects at work and the stuff we
123:28 - did in the stream
123:30 - and so i remembered it so much better so
123:32 - then when i actually got to the point in
123:34 - the udacity course where i had to build
123:35 - my own project
123:37 - i had retained a lot of the knowledge
123:39 - from the lectures and and the little
123:42 - exercises that we had done along the way
123:44 - because i'd already used it
123:46 - so
123:47 - that's just kind of my general advice
123:51 - i think it can be applied safely to a
123:53 - lot of different things in programming
123:56 - and probably to other fields as well
124:00 - um
124:01 - i mean i don't know if if you have like
124:03 - any specific areas about python i don't
124:05 - know how much i can help because i
124:07 - i don't know that much about python
124:10 - [Applause]
124:12 - um harshit says here's some more
124:14 - specific advice this is good so harsh it
124:15 - says make servers or learn ai
124:18 - says there's a huge scope for python
124:21 - nikola says which time tomorrow will you
124:23 - stream uh in your time um
124:27 - i'm trying to stream
124:30 - i've been trying to stream earlier
124:31 - around noon it seems like a better time
124:33 - for um
124:35 - for time zones that are like
124:37 - in india and in
124:39 - that area of the world
124:41 - so
124:43 - maybe noon or one
124:45 - p.m eastern time in my time
124:50 - so sometimes i have things going on and
124:52 - i can't stick to a time
124:54 - but
124:55 - expect it sometime around there
125:01 - uh vivek says which field is more
125:03 - appropriate in the future ai or
125:04 - networking
125:06 - i don't know ai just it seems like it's
125:09 - really cool these days uh so harsha's
125:11 - answer is good says ai is really hot
125:13 - these days but there's always need of
125:15 - networking
125:17 - yeah
125:18 - yeah i mean i tend to agree it does
125:24 - i i think they'll both still be
125:26 - you know useful and around for a long
125:28 - time
125:28 - if i had to pick honestly
125:32 - assuming that i could safely get a job
125:34 - in either one and support my family i'd
125:36 - pick ai because that just seems
125:39 - it seems really cool to work on
125:44 - harshad also says you should be good at
125:46 - math and math for ai okay it's cool it's
125:48 - good to know
125:50 - that's some good specific advice there
125:55 - harshad also says networking is easier
125:57 - to learn
126:02 - uh abby schick says
126:04 - ionic or react native for android i
126:07 - recommend react native
126:09 - i think react native has some advantages
126:11 - over using ionic uh it lets you use like
126:15 - some more of like the lower level stuff
126:18 - um that you know
126:20 - won't necessarily have access to if
126:22 - you're using ionic now i haven't checked
126:24 - into ionic for years so maybe it's it's
126:28 - different now but as far as i know
126:30 - i think react native gives is is the
126:32 - better way to go
126:39 - uh vivek says what time do you stream in
126:42 - india
126:43 - um
126:44 - i don't know for sure there might be
126:46 - multiple time zones in india but
126:49 - for harsh it's time zone
126:51 - um
126:53 - which i need harsh it's in the himalayas
126:55 - but
126:56 - for that time zone
126:58 - noon would be like 11 p.m
127:01 - right
127:03 - let me know horizon uh is 12
127:06 - my 12 p.m my time 11 p.m for you
127:13 - it's somewhere around there it might not
127:15 - be exactly 11
127:16 - uh but i think it's that's close
127:22 - vivek says i'm stuck in many things so i
127:25 - can't decide my my future
127:28 - uh yeah that's tough vivek i mean right
127:30 - now just do what you can with what you
127:31 - have and don't worry about what you
127:33 - can't control you know
127:35 - um
127:37 - that way at least you can make progress
127:39 - with with what you do if it turns out
127:41 - you can end up doing more and have you
127:43 - know some more freedom in your decisions
127:45 - at some point then you'll be prepared
127:51 - uh
127:51 - [Music]
127:53 - let's see xavier says any way to
127:56 - contribute to your projects there used
127:58 - to be an option in free code camp to
127:59 - make websites for charities like for
128:01 - free
128:02 - um yeah i'm not sure how that works with
128:05 - the charities thing in free code camp
128:08 - but you can definitely contribute to
128:09 - these projects
128:12 - check out the repositories that we have
128:16 - and
128:17 - you know
128:18 - go to the link check out that whole
128:20 - github organization
128:22 - and any of the repositories just look at
128:25 - the
128:27 - uh look at the issues that are open and
128:30 - you can take one of those and work on it
128:31 - or if you notice some glaring flaw
128:34 - you can open your own issue and you'll
128:37 - work on that if you want
128:39 - if you need any help or ideas just just
128:41 - let me know
128:47 - oh cool good to know vivek says there's
128:49 - only one time zone in india it's gmt
128:53 - all right very good to know
129:01 - that's cool that's nice there's one time
129:02 - zone in the in the u.s we have so many
129:05 - time zones sometimes it's
129:07 - when you're traveling
129:09 - in within the country like it can be
129:11 - confusing um sometimes
129:15 - as you pass through time zones it's like
129:18 - depending on which way you're going it
129:20 - either seems like you gained a lot of
129:21 - time or you lost a lot of time
129:31 - um
129:32 - abby scheck says which library should be
129:34 - used for employing
129:36 - machine learning and web apps
129:39 - uh i i really don't know i don't know
129:41 - enough about that
129:44 - i know
129:45 - there is some uh machine learning
129:48 - javascript libraries out there
129:51 - i'll i don't remember offhand what
129:53 - they're called though uh but they do
129:55 - exist if you're gonna use them in web
129:56 - apps you may as well use javascript
130:00 - because you're going to be using it
130:01 - anyway since it's a web app
130:04 - so that would be my recommendation i
130:06 - don't know if you could run machine
130:07 - learning stuff client-side i assume
130:10 - you'd have to run it server side with
130:12 - node
130:13 - um
130:14 - i don't know it it would kind of be cool
130:16 - if there's a really something really
130:18 - lightweight that you could do basic
130:19 - machine learning stuff in the client but
130:21 - i i don't think that exists i think it's
130:23 - too resource intensive
130:40 - oh wow vivek says it's 1 15 a.m
130:44 - uh
130:45 - it is
130:46 - it is 2 46 p.m
130:49 - right now where i am
130:57 - abby
130:58 - asks is it advisable to learn two
131:00 - javascript frameworks at the same time
131:03 - um
131:05 - i wouldn't try to do it myself
131:08 - i'd rather focus on one and learn it
131:10 - really well the only way i would do that
131:12 - is if i um i wasn't sure whether i
131:14 - wanted to do one or the other and i just
131:16 - wanted to learn the basics of both to
131:18 - make a decision
131:20 - uh but i think it's better to choose
131:23 - i always i i think i mentioned this
131:24 - before in a stream but i i read it
131:26 - really like an old book once uh but it
131:29 - was about
131:32 - basically like ways to live your life to
131:34 - help like improve your brain um and your
131:37 - intellect and
131:40 - uh it was one of the things that it had
131:42 - said
131:43 - was was basically and this is in my own
131:45 - words
131:46 - was
131:47 - if you really want to be good at
131:49 - something you have to say no to
131:50 - everything else
131:52 - so
131:53 - right if you really want to be good at
131:55 - react you say no to angular and view if
131:58 - you really want to be you know and it
131:59 - works with anything in life not just
132:01 - programming it doesn't mean you can't do
132:03 - those other things but you can't do it
132:05 - at the same level right you have to
132:07 - focus there are some people who can be
132:09 - good at a lot of different things
132:12 - but if they would just pick one they
132:13 - could be great at it
132:15 - so if you want to really be great and
132:17 - like one of the best at something you're
132:19 - gonna have to pick other things
132:21 - um
132:22 - which is like
132:24 - i mean that that's kind of freeing and
132:26 - restrictive in the same time because it
132:29 - almost gives you license to be able to
132:31 - focus and you'll be okay with that um
132:34 - but but you do have to decide
132:37 - uh so i guess just think about that some
132:39 - people would may rather just be kind of
132:41 - good at a lot of things
132:43 - or even really good at a lot of things
132:45 - but to get to that best level you do
132:48 - have to choose and so that's why i would
132:51 - say
132:52 - learn one framework well
132:55 - and be really awesome at it
132:59 - that's what i would do
133:01 - but lisa it does depend a little bit on
133:03 - your goals and what your intention is
133:05 - for learning both of them
133:08 - all right i mean
133:09 - if you're in a a company that uses both
133:11 - obviously you have to learn both if
133:13 - you're a freelancer and you want to open
133:15 - yourself up to more clients yeah learn
133:17 - both but if you have the freedom to be
133:19 - able to pick one and stick with it
133:22 - i i would do that
133:30 - oh vivec says for machine learning
133:32 - tensorflow is good it's uh developed by
133:34 - google that's right yeah i
133:37 - i do remember hearing good things about
133:39 - tensorflow haven't used it yet but i've
133:41 - just heard good things
133:44 - uh hardship says javascript is terrible
133:46 - in machine learning use python
133:49 - it says 95 percent uses tensorflow
133:53 - hardship is making an ai chat bot
133:56 - vivec asks where i lived in america i
133:58 - live in ohio
133:59 - i actually live right on the border of
134:01 - ohio and pennsylvania and west virginia
134:04 - like they all meet at one place
134:06 - so i live the the big city that i'm
134:09 - closest to is pittsburgh
134:11 - so i'm pretty close to pittsburgh
134:14 - and
134:16 - so i'm in the eastern time zone so like
134:18 - new york city is in the same time zone
134:21 - that i'm in the whole east coast of the
134:22 - united states is in that time zone
134:31 - all right
134:33 - hey har [ __ ] harshest said stephenville
134:35 - ohio you remembered yes
134:37 - stephenville was a small city uh like i
134:41 - don't know like sixteen thousand people
134:43 - in steubenville i think
134:48 - vivek says uh ohio have their own
134:51 - university yeah so
134:52 - ohio has um
134:55 - a lot of universities so there's a
134:57 - university here in stephenville and
134:59 - that's what that's the university i work
135:01 - for it's uh franciscan university of
135:02 - steubenville there's a and it's so it's
135:05 - an independent
135:07 - school but there are state schools that
135:09 - are like government funded so ohio state
135:13 - is the big state school i believe it's
135:15 - the largest university in the state of
135:16 - ohio
135:18 - and then there's there's a lot of other
135:20 - small universities
135:25 - so
135:26 - small and there are some other state
135:28 - universities as well so there's there's
135:30 - a lot but
135:32 - [Music]
135:34 - ohio is one of the more important states
135:37 - in the united states
135:38 - uh several like major cities and things
135:43 - i'm not originally from ohio though i'm
135:45 - from west virginia which is one of the
135:46 - least important states
135:50 - but i i love it i love my home state
135:53 - um
135:54 - vivek says what job do you do i am a i'm
135:57 - officially a front end developer but
135:59 - realistically i i do a lot of back end
136:01 - stuff as well
136:04 - but my title is front and developer and
136:06 - if you'd like to know more about what i
136:07 - do just check out the stream because i'm
136:09 - streaming this from my job
136:12 - so this is my my actual work that i'm
136:14 - doing each day on the stream
136:18 - stuff you don't see are basically me
136:19 - sitting in meetings
136:21 - answering emails and uh sending messages
136:24 - on slack
136:26 - but like my real work is is exactly the
136:29 - same as what i stream
136:36 - let's see
136:38 - um
136:39 - here's another question and wow all
136:41 - right i'm gonna have trouble with this
136:42 - name i'm gonna do my best
136:44 - red jesh rajesh khannan
136:49 - really sorry if i messed that up um says
136:51 - how to improve my web design skill
136:54 - if you want to know more about design i
136:55 - recommend
136:56 - read through some the material design
136:59 - documentation just to get an idea of
137:01 - like the the logic behind design which
137:04 - you have to think about
137:06 - uh and then check out
137:07 - some other designs um so
137:12 - like there are websites that like give
137:14 - awards for the best website designs like
137:16 - check those out just kind of look at
137:19 - what's new and design things you like
137:21 - and don't like
137:22 - um and and then just try things out
137:27 - um
137:28 - you'll get a feel once you look at
137:30 - enough
137:32 - design and work with it enough you'll
137:33 - start to get a feel for what works and
137:35 - what doesn't just by looking at it
137:37 - you'll be able to look and say no those
137:39 - colors don't work i need more white
137:41 - space uh this needs to be a few pixels
137:43 - one way or the other like it takes a
137:46 - while to get that but eventually like
137:49 - you'll get it and i'm not saying i'm the
137:50 - best at design but you know i'm
137:52 - definitely at the point where i can look
137:54 - at something and say this will look
137:55 - better if it were adjusted a few pixels
137:57 - or those colors definitely don't work
138:00 - um
138:01 - and
138:02 - at that point and then you know even
138:04 - beyond i'm sure there are people that
138:06 - are even so much better at that and can
138:08 - come up with an awesome design like
138:10 - you know right off just off the top of
138:13 - their head on a piece of paper or
138:14 - something but that would be my advice
138:16 - just kind of check out the designs that
138:19 - are prominent now
138:21 - read about like why they do it and check
138:24 - out some of the websites that are really
138:26 - getting
138:28 - like recognized for having good design
138:40 - uh
138:40 - let's say
138:42 - yes
138:45 - abby six says how to make svg responsive
138:48 - and web pages
138:51 - um harshad said media queries yeah media
138:53 - queries so
138:55 - i'll tell you what check out some of the
138:57 - videos by sarah drazner
139:00 - um
139:02 - she's really good with svg's
139:04 - and
139:05 - so check out some of her stuff i've
139:07 - heard some of her talks before where she
139:09 - covers like responsiveness and svg's and
139:12 - it's actually a lot better to use svg's
139:15 - as opposed to normal images if you want
139:17 - things to look great on different
139:18 - screens because there's
139:21 - i don't know there's really cool stuff
139:22 - that you can do
139:25 - there's so much you can do with svg so i
139:27 - check out some of her stuff if you want
139:28 - to learn more about it but
139:30 - essentially yes like media queries work
139:32 - a lot using like percentage widths
139:36 - instead of
139:37 - um
139:39 - like a fixed width
139:41 - you know helps a lot
139:44 - uh but i think was sarah drazner yeah
139:46 - that's d-r-a-s-n-e-r
139:53 - uh vivek says bro you live in america
139:56 - it's great but i live in india it's also
139:58 - great but i want to get a job in google
140:00 - california
140:02 - yeah um
140:04 - it'd be great to work at google uh they
140:06 - have
140:07 - you make a lot of money there's um
140:10 - like a great a lot of like perks to
140:12 - working at google like you most likely
140:14 - have access to a lot of awesome
140:16 - technology
140:18 - they also have a lot of different
140:19 - locations worldwide as well so
140:22 - i mean it'd be cool to live in
140:23 - california i wouldn't want to live there
140:25 - though because it's really really
140:26 - expensive to try to find a house or an
140:28 - apartment in california but google does
140:30 - have other locations like they actually
140:33 - have a location in pittsburgh which
140:35 - would be really cool to work at i could
140:37 - i could live in the same house i live in
140:39 - now and just commute into pittsburgh and
140:41 - work at google there
140:43 - if they'll they'll have me if anybody
140:44 - from google is watching
140:47 - i mean
140:49 - give me a call
140:50 - maybe we'll see
140:54 - uh i like my job right now and where i'm
140:56 - at but i probably would not turn down
140:58 - something from google it's just a great
141:00 - opportunity
141:02 - um
141:03 - assuming i would even good enough to
141:04 - work there i don't know about that
141:08 - um
141:10 - let's see
141:17 - whoa
141:18 - uh all ozos just
141:21 - put a lyric up from country roads which
141:24 - is basically like the the theme song of
141:26 - my home state of west virginia
141:29 - so
141:30 - you you just made my heart feel like
141:34 - longing for my homeland right now just
141:36 - from that lyric so i'm gonna like be
141:39 - singing that song all day every true
141:41 - west virginian knows all the words to
141:43 - that song and can sing it whenever it
141:45 - comes on
141:47 - so
141:50 - how did you know about that
141:52 - song um
141:55 - well i really i appreciate that that's
141:57 - awesome you put that in there
142:00 - um
142:05 - let's see
142:21 - oh yeah so they're saying sarah drazner
142:23 - works at microsoft yeah yeah she works
142:26 - at microsoft she's really active on
142:28 - twitter as well uh you check out her
142:29 - twitter stuff she has she's spoken at a
142:32 - ton of different conferences so she's on
142:34 - a lot of different youtube channels
142:36 - for different things she i think she has
142:39 - a talk on free code camps talk channels
142:42 - so free codecam has two different
142:43 - channels if you check out their talk
142:45 - channel
142:46 - um
142:48 - then uh i think she's on there
142:53 - but yeah everything i've ever seen her
142:54 - do with svg's is just amazing
143:11 - i should say jesse they will probably
143:13 - not hire a react engineer
143:15 - as facebook yeah i don't
143:17 - i assume i'd be doing other things and
143:19 - and not react i don't does google use
143:21 - react for anything i don't know maybe
143:23 - they do
143:24 - um
143:26 - yeah so maybe i'd be doing other stuff
143:27 - but
143:28 - i mean they gotta have people writing
143:30 - javascript right they have a lot of
143:32 - websites so i'd probably be doing
143:33 - something with javascript
143:36 - i do use a lot of material design
143:39 - and google uh
143:41 - google invented that so
143:44 - maybe maybe there's a show for me
143:46 - um
143:49 - john hanson says it's for you google's
143:51 - calling yeah
143:54 - be crazy if they actually did call me
143:56 - during a stream at some point
143:59 - um
144:01 - all right
144:03 - i've gotten to the end of the live chat
144:05 - finally
144:06 - all right so i think i'm going to stop
144:07 - for real this time
144:10 - uh thanks everyone for watching
144:12 - uh we
144:16 - we did some good stuff
144:18 - uh didn't get everything done that i
144:20 - wanted to but
144:22 - um the work that we did it worked so
144:25 - that's that's a plus
144:27 - so i'll be back tomorrow i'm going to
144:29 - try to stream sometime around like noon
144:32 - or 1pm
144:34 - uh
144:36 - another question
144:37 - um
144:39 - says would you recommend for me to go to
144:41 - into app academy
144:44 - um
144:46 - i'm not sure exactly what app academy is
144:48 - but
144:49 - my recommendation for any type of thing
144:51 - like that or boot camp or something is
144:53 - check it out to make sure that they're
144:54 - legitimate and see like do people really
144:57 - get jobs from this
145:00 - check on the price if you can afford it
145:02 - and you can take the time and it seems
145:04 - like it's a reputable thing
145:06 - then go for it
145:08 - i've never done anything like that
145:11 - uh so i can't tell you personally but
145:13 - like my wife's doing a boot camp right
145:15 - now and she seems to be really happy
145:16 - with it so
145:19 - um without knowing more details that's
145:21 - just kind of my general advice
145:26 - uh
145:27 - all right so now
145:29 - let me get out of here i'm really hungry
145:31 - at this point so i actually do want to
145:33 - end the stream
145:34 - uh and get something to eat so
145:38 - thanks so much everyone for watching
145:40 - i'll be back tomorrow until then have a
145:42 - great day
