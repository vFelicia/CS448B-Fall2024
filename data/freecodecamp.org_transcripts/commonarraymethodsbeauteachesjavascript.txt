00:00 - Tinh common array methods I'm gonna go
over some of the most commonly used
00:03 - array methods in JavaScript the first
one is going to be a raid is pushed the
00:07 - push method this just adds a new element
into the end of an array and if I
00:15 - console that lock that you can see now
it's ABCD and you can see that started
00:25 - off as just ABC the next one I want to
show you is a pop pop removes the last
00:30 - element in an array and returns that
element now run that we're gonna see
00:41 - that we have the D and then if I just
cancel that log the array again you will
00:49 - see that now the array doesn't have that
the D on there because it's been popped
00:53 - off the push and pop changes the
original array now next one is concat
00:59 - which concatenates two arrays first I
have to make a new new array so I have
01:11 - the first array okay
all right - if I run that we're gonna
01:17 - see ABC v/q one thing interesting about
that is that it does not affect the
01:23 - original array so if I just console dot
log the second array we'll see that it's
01:32 - still GQ the next one I'm gonna go over
is its join this joins all the elements
01:37 - in an array to create a string and also
does not modify the original array Sofia
01:45 - run that you can see at the end we just
have the string ABC and if we put
01:49 - something I joined this with just a
empty string but I can also put
01:53 - something in here like an exclamation
point I can run them and you can see now
01:57 - there's an exclamation point between
each item in the array and that that
02:00 - string and the original array stays the
same
02:02 - next up is reverse which just reverses
the elements in an array
02:12 - if I run that you can see at the bottom
CBA and that does change the change
02:18 - their array so if I console dot log the
array now you can see at the NCBA CBA
02:29 - the shift function is going to remove
the first element in the array in return
02:33 - that element so the first Elm is C
because we reversed an earlier before we
02:43 - reverse that array to see ba now it's
returning that first element C and if we
02:48 - just console dot log that array again we
will see that it is the C is removed so
02:55 - if you look at the bottom just gonna be
be a for the array I'm shift adds a new
03:00 - element to the beginning of your right
and returns the length of the modified
03:03 - array so at the end is just gonna say 3
because remember before the array was ba
03:10 - so this is or added the P to end to make
three elements in the array so if we
03:19 - just log that array we'll see P be a and
the P at the beginning of the array
03:26 - slice is going to select part of an
array in return that new already you've
03:30 - selected in the original array remains
unchanged slice is going to accept two
03:34 - arguments the start and the end minus
one
03:37 - let me give you an example so it's going
to start at the index one and then the
03:48 - second argument is the end - one two -
one is me one so this is only gonna be
03:53 - one character of the array because you
always because this it's this minus one
03:57 - for the end character let me get console
that log date so you can see that this
04:01 - is the original rate pba and we're gonna
start at index 1 starts index 0 then we
04:07 - have index 1 and then we're going to end
at the index 2 minus 1 0 1 2 minus 1 so
04:14 - we can end at the same character that we
started at so it's only going to return
04:17 - B if we change the second argument to 3
then it's going to be PA instead of a
04:24 - and slice does not change the original
ready
04:28 - so the original array is still gonna be
PBA now I'm gonna show you sort was just
04:33 - sorting array so first I'm gonna push a
few more letters onto the array you see
04:47 - at the end a BF IP so that's all sort of
even though you can see that I add F at
04:52 - the end it ended up sorting everybody it
was PBA this is what the array started
04:57 - off as because this Mike Winston slice
is something it's not going to change
05:01 - the original array so it we had this and
we added a F and then it's sorted to be
05:06 - like that and you can see that sort does
change the original array the last one I
05:11 - want to tell you about is splice splice
is very similar to slice but it's going
05:16 - to modify the original array instead of
just returning a new array also the
05:22 - arguments are going to be a little
different
05:31 - the first argument is going to be the
start index also as to the second
05:37 - argument is the number of items to count
from the starting point to remove so if
05:42 - I put two that means two items are going
to be removed
05:44 - starting at the set the second index I
put three then three ends will be
05:48 - removed and then the third argument is
any items you want to add so I'm going
05:55 - to add Jase nuggets and it's going to
return the items that were removed and
06:03 - then I'm going to log the array so if
you can see first it removes fi because
06:14 - it started off with this array and we
went to this index two if we have zero
06:19 - one two we remove two items one two F&I
and that's what it returns for this
06:25 - first console log and then we're going
to console dot log the new array which
06:29 - is be a be jeaious nuggets because it's
going to insert it at the index that we
06:34 - had up here which is the second index
and we're still gonna have the P on here
06:39 - well thanks for watching
