00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:12 - with Jessie and today we're going to go
00:16 - over well we're gonna start with
00:21 - continuing where we left off yesterday
00:23 - and then when I get to the question
00:26 - answer session I want to go over some
00:27 - changes that I made on project project 2
00:32 - so I had a meeting this morning and had
00:35 - some additional project requirements so
00:39 - I'm not gonna code anything but I just
00:45 - want to go over a few things that I did
00:47 - because I think they were they'll be
00:50 - kind of useful so sorry I didn't have my
00:52 - camera working when I started it should
00:54 - be working now I was just reading about
00:57 - a way to use your phone as your webcam
01:02 - so if I can get that working I might try
01:05 - that and then maybe I won't have
01:06 - problems with the webcam anymore and it
01:08 - should be a much better picture too
01:10 - because I think I know I could record 4k
01:15 - video so I have no idea how many
01:17 - megapixels my phone is but it's it's
01:19 - definitely better than my built-in
01:21 - webcam on my iMac to everyone I see some
01:28 - people saying hi in the live chat there
01:30 - so all right let's um let's get started
01:36 - and let me bring let me bring over my
01:44 - my timer bring the timer over and let's
01:49 - organize our windows so you don't have
01:51 - to flip around so much so we'll bring
01:54 - over
01:54 - let's bring over the code here and bring
01:58 - that over there we go so here's just
02:01 - what we had so far I think we I think I
02:09 - accidentally searched so let's go to I
02:20 - think that was the URL hopefully there
02:26 - we go that's it all right so this is a
02:28 - South where we we yesterday doesn't look
02:31 - like much but we learned a lot about how
02:35 - this thing is structured so the plan
02:40 - today is to Pomodoro sessions of code
02:42 - and then a question answer session I
02:45 - think when we do that that gives us a
02:47 - nice about about an hour and a half
02:49 - at least unless there's like no
02:53 - questions and then we're maybe we'll be
02:55 - at like an hour and 15 minutes but I
02:57 - think that's a nice length a nice length
03:00 - for the show it gives us a long enough
03:01 - time to get get something done I get
03:04 - some questions in but it's not so long
03:06 - that I think it seems like too daunting
03:08 - if for someone to watch the replay so
03:13 - I'm gonna start my first Pomodoro
03:15 - session after this one's over I'll take
03:17 - five minutes and answer some questions
03:18 - so if you ask something in the live chat
03:20 - and I don't get to it just wait and I
03:22 - will get to it you know after the timer
03:25 - is up and then at the end I'll try to
03:29 - get to every question so if you can
03:31 - stick around till the end I'll
03:33 - definitely get your question answered
03:34 - and no-beard notice that I that I saved
03:41 - yeah I did out my I was just really busy
03:44 - with well with work and my family and
03:48 - the the nanodegree program I just hadn't
03:53 - shaved in like a week because every time
03:56 - I got up to get ready
03:58 - work I was always running late from like
04:01 - staying up late trying to trying to do
04:03 - this work so anyway so I finally got the
04:06 - shape that was nice but let's get
04:09 - started
04:11 - let's see we are today going to try to
04:16 - well first thing we should do is make
04:20 - this visible right because we're not
04:22 - really gonna know if we've done anything
04:24 - right unless this is visible I mean we
04:27 - can see the we can see here in dev tools
04:34 - that what we've done is actually being
04:37 - inserted properly into the Dom but for
04:40 - some reason we can't see it so let's
04:43 - figure that out first it hopefully
04:45 - should only take a few minutes then
04:47 - we're going to define those find those
04:51 - points where the data from the content
04:55 - management system is being inserted into
04:58 - the current menus and we're going to
04:59 - take those and we're going to plug them
05:01 - in with that repeater component that we
05:04 - found yesterday and we're going to try
05:07 - to plug them in in our side nav where we
05:09 - want those fields to be and hopefully
05:12 - it'll work out that all the links that
05:14 - were in the other menu are now going to
05:16 - be in our menu and they're all going to
05:20 - look right so if if you're not familiar
05:22 - with what we're doing this is the menu
05:25 - that we're going for and I'll show you I
05:31 - can show you the menu that we're coming
05:33 - from so we're one of this we want the
05:35 - links to be on the side here also a
05:39 - search bar there when you click this
05:42 - it'll actually open up the side knife
05:45 - and then this side which is taking a
05:51 - significant amount of time to load this
05:53 - time you can see this that was that was
05:55 - insane we didn't even see anything but
05:57 - white for I wasn't counting but that was
06:00 - at least five seconds maybe more but
06:03 - anyway this is our current navigation
06:05 - and we want to go to this
06:10 - okay so let's check out just right here
06:16 - in dev tools what's going on and the
06:23 - first thing I want to do
06:26 - let's see where all right work we're out
06:34 - from here
06:36 - many contents that's a bunch of stuff
06:47 - there we go so we're up here everything
06:49 - below here is the main content which
06:52 - that's not what we're dealing with right
06:53 - now we are dealing with the the header
07:00 - which I guess is inside of here yep
07:03 - here's our header okay oh you know what
07:11 - I just remembered now that we never
07:15 - imported our style so we're gonna use
07:17 - materialized and we never brought it in
07:21 - so let's do that
07:22 - I suspect that once we do that things
07:25 - are gonna look a lot different let's see
07:28 - I hope they look a lot different because
07:30 - they should so let's grab from
07:32 - materialized the CSS and JavaScript for
07:40 - now I think I'm just gonna load it from
07:42 - a CDN might think about probably in the
07:45 - end we're just gonna host it ourselves
07:47 - and we're gonna pull out everything that
07:50 - we're not using to trim it down a bit
07:52 - but for now we'll go with the CDN and
07:55 - then that way we'll have access to
07:57 - everything while we're developing
07:59 - I think that'll just it'll be faster
08:01 - than having to go and grab things and
08:03 - put it I've tried it both ways I've
08:05 - tried starting with nothing and pulling
08:06 - in what I want and I try starting with
08:08 - everything and then pulling out what I
08:09 - didn't use I think it does go faster if
08:13 - you start with everything so materialize
08:18 - there we go getting started okay little
08:27 - versions one one is coming soon I wonder
08:31 - how sin but for this I'm fine with I'm
08:38 - fine with using whatever version where
08:39 - we have access to okay so this is whoops
08:45 - I did not want to save would almost
08:47 - musta hit can command s instead of
08:50 - command C so I'm gonna copy that and
08:53 - we'll put that in
09:01 - now I don't want to put it in here
09:07 - actually I'm almost kind of thinking
09:10 - this over just coming from like the
09:12 - react world so I was working all morning
09:16 - on react and just thinking of like
09:20 - importing our styles and things right
09:22 - into the component that we need I'm
09:24 - wondering if it would be good to import
09:28 - the stuff right in this main nav
09:30 - component that way if there's any pages
09:34 - we don't use the main nav I guess we
09:37 - wouldn't now you know it that's that's
09:40 - nonsense because we're gonna end up
09:42 - using this throughout so we're gonna use
09:46 - these styles so if I was only in ez
09:48 - styles for the main nav it would make
09:50 - sense that that old thing might not have
09:54 - made sense I was just kind of thinking
09:55 - out loud but basically I was I was
09:58 - thinking that if I put the Styles that I
10:01 - needed just in that component then I
10:03 - wouldn't load them on pages where I'm
10:05 - not using that component but I'm
10:08 - probably gonna use that same header on
10:10 - every page and I'll probably use these
10:15 - styles from materialize for a lot of
10:18 - other things so I'm just gonna put it in
10:21 - main master test oops not that one this
10:25 - one okay so we can see everything else
10:30 - that we have I'm gonna put these right
10:32 - now below this is quite a large there we
10:40 - go I'm gonna put it right at the bottom
10:42 - so that way I know we're gonna override
10:44 - a lot of this and then whatever custom
10:47 - styles we need to use we'll put it under
10:51 - under these to be able to override the
10:54 - things and materialize mm-hmm so how
10:59 - excuse me and that should that should be
11:05 - good hopefully we can get rid of a lot
11:09 - of the styles that are that are
11:11 - so we saw like I know I saw a custom
11:15 - Styles being imported let's see yeah
11:25 - here so we have a lot of different
11:27 - styles coming in you can see at one
11:30 - point I actually went in and I tried to
11:34 - clean this up so we have like the all
11:36 - these bundled I think it was interesting
11:40 - what I found was that there wasn't it
11:43 - actually loaded more slowly when I
11:45 - bundled them all together so that's why
11:48 - these are commented out not so I'd like
11:50 - to test it again and and see what
11:53 - happens because that was kind of odd
11:55 - that you know they're like that and I
11:58 - went through and I meant if I'd a lot of
12:01 - these so a lot of these are the minified
12:03 - versions even if they don't say men so
12:07 - but we'll go through a later on after we
12:09 - get it looking like we want to we'll go
12:10 - through and try to get rid of as much as
12:12 - we can
12:13 - alright so that should have loaded let's
12:22 - refresh
12:27 - whoa all right okay so it's looking
12:38 - pretty bad but we have something on the
12:40 - on the screen at least so we can see
12:42 - that we have you know we have some of
12:44 - these links we have this is an SVG it's
12:50 - supposed to be the Facebook icon okay so
12:58 - what we have I do have some Styles that
13:03 - I did not import it just let my mind
13:05 - until now that I had made some custom
13:08 - styles for that header I didn't bring
13:10 - those in so I need to bring those in I
13:13 - need to check to see if I did any
13:15 - JavaScript that I need to bring in as
13:17 - well and that should help get these you
13:21 - know down to normal size and get our
13:23 - colors right however we still have I
13:29 - think we'll still have some work to do
13:32 - here because we have some weird stuff
13:33 - going on I suspect that we'll see what
13:38 - happens when I bring in the other styles
13:40 - but I suspect that maybe there's some
13:43 - conflicts and you know maybe there's
13:49 - some really specific CSS selectors in
13:51 - the custom CSS that was already on this
13:55 - site maybe they used important a lot and
13:57 - it's overriding some stuff so we'll just
14:00 - we'll have to deal with that the tricky
14:03 - part is we have to deal with it in a way
14:06 - that doesn't mess up other parts of the
14:09 - site so it's gonna get I don't know it's
14:16 - gonna be touchy it's it's I don't know I
14:19 - think it'll be fun though I know it at
14:23 - my meeting earlier when I told everyone
14:27 - in my department that I started working
14:28 - on this they were all excited so that's
14:33 - that's cool I like to work on projects
14:37 - like that so we'll be at main that
14:47 - I guess I can import it here I was once
14:49 - again trying to decide whether I should
14:50 - just import this here but I probably
14:52 - have some styles that I'll end up using
14:54 - so we need to do is find here we go
15:01 - here's what we have for the for that nav
15:05 - so if you remember yesterday we pulled
15:07 - the mark up for it but not the style so
15:12 - let's grab our CSS and it looks like
15:21 - most of this I'm just gonna copy and
15:27 - paste all of it right now it's not that
15:29 - much there's some stuff that I don't
15:31 - need yet but I will need later like the
15:33 - footer and then the loaders I might keep
15:38 - the loader we'll see I don't know that
15:42 - it would make sense on this site I use
15:48 - it a lot when I have sites with that I
15:50 - have like client-side navigation but I'm
15:53 - not sure how well it would work out
15:55 - we'll see oh okay yeah most of this
16:02 - makes sense to keep so let's pull this
16:05 - over and
16:12 - let's make whoops I'm sorry I went to
16:15 - the wrong wrong place I have a lot going
16:17 - on over here on this screen and if we
16:24 - can make
16:33 - I wonder where the rest of these files
16:35 - are our house that is there we go
16:44 - alright this looks like the place
16:46 - alright so let's add a file in here new
16:53 - file we should call this I don't know I
17:05 - guess it doesn't matter new design I
17:17 - will call that not not very creative but
17:21 - it'll work for now I was thinking about
17:23 - putting something like Jesse's awesome
17:25 - theme or something but it's not it's the
17:28 - University site I don't I don't really
17:32 - want to mess with that okay cool I like
17:39 - how that looks
17:39 - it's a little bit different than Adam
17:41 - just how they how things get highlighted
17:43 - and it's not bad I wanted I think I want
17:48 - to try to match my theme that I use an
17:51 - atom with the theme I used in Visual
17:52 - Studio code since I'm used to it yeah it
17:57 - looks a little weird sometimes so I've
18:00 - been using this other theme for a long
18:02 - time for years all right so here's our
18:05 - CSS let's check out the JavaScript see
18:11 - if we have anything that's going to
18:12 - apply okay so I have this I like to put
18:17 - this on all of my sites and at least all
18:19 - the ones that I'm using jQuery with and
18:21 - it just keeps the copyright date current
18:24 - and you know everybody puts a copyright
18:27 - date in the in the footer
18:39 - you know we do have some things that
18:40 - I'll need to use yeah this is I have
18:44 - those links in the in the top nav when
18:49 - you click them it automatically opens
18:50 - that side nav so I'm definitely going to
18:52 - have to have to do that although I'll
18:58 - have to check at one point materialize
19:00 - change their API when it comes to
19:02 - modal's so I can't remember if I did
19:06 - this before or after that change
19:08 - occurred so if the modal is not working
19:11 - the first thing I'll check is you know
19:14 - how we're doing this
19:15 - well then I'll check the materialized
19:17 - docs because I had that happen on a few
19:19 - of my sites when I went to up update to
19:22 - newer versions of materialized all right
19:27 - let me make sure that coffee that
19:29 - alright we're gonna do the same thing
19:31 - we're just gonna make a custom
19:32 - javascript file so let's see where we're
19:36 - bringing in the mmm J's vendor well I'll
19:41 - find this a Jas file so that'll work
19:43 - there we go alright so let's make a new
19:50 - file let's call this new design Jas and
20:00 - then we'll copy that save alright now we
20:06 - just need to pull these in so I'll just
20:11 - OOP someone I'll copy this and
20:20 - I'll make it new design touch a s and so
20:27 - now we're bringing in our JavaScript and
20:29 - let's find our CSS and let's I want to I
20:40 - want to bring this down below so yeah
20:42 - here's what CSS oops oh this is right I
20:49 - didn't make it new design dot CSS and
20:54 - let's do the same thing with our
20:56 - JavaScript and that'll be it'll be
21:00 - better we'll have all of our stuff all
21:02 - together right here at the bottom it'll
21:05 - be easy for us to find it okay not
21:14 - indentation and stuff is not pretty
21:17 - right now what the heck no I gotta
21:24 - change my settings here might add key is
21:27 - set to actually tab instead of two
21:29 - spaces like I usually have it so I need
21:32 - to need to do some work on that alright
21:36 - so now let's refresh and see what we
21:39 - have
21:48 - okay a lot better not not what we want
21:53 - yet but it's a lot better okay yeah
22:00 - we're on our side now it's not working
22:02 - let's check our console and see what
22:03 - errors we have all right a lot of stuff
22:10 - wow that's huge
22:14 - okay okay we don't have the image that
22:21 - makes sense
22:26 - velocity is not defined
22:45 - smashing
22:57 - so I know it's not a function okay
23:04 - all right so we've got a lot of stuff
23:07 - going on
23:16 - okay okay I just checked the live chat
23:20 - Alberto says do you have jQuery imported
23:23 - above material je s I I don't know let's
23:27 - check that out yeah actually we do so we
23:36 - have we have this above let's check them
23:41 - it materialized Docs and see if we need
23:44 - a certain version of jQuery
24:05 - Wow okay so it's saying jQuery 3.2.1 I
24:12 - don't want to have to use multiple
24:15 - versions of jQuery I don't really know
24:19 - what the compatibility is I mean we
24:22 - could try we could try to pull in this
24:25 - jQuery and see you know what I'm a
24:30 - little bit worried too about this side
24:32 - nav is not a function so let's check out
24:36 - the documentation
24:44 - dear
24:51 - so now there we go
25:02 - okay well so that is in there it's it's
25:06 - still it's still side nav
25:29 - interesting
25:50 - well
26:04 - all right let's let's check on that
26:06 - modal right now while we have the dogs
26:08 - open okay I do have the newer yes so we
26:20 - initialize it with dot modal okay it
26:25 - should be all right then
26:44 - okay all right this is gonna be it's
26:52 - gonna be some work all right well let's
26:54 - just go through let's check what version
27:02 - of jQuery I was using and what version
27:05 - materialized I was using on this other
27:11 - this oversight here
27:13 - okay so this was that that demo site I
27:17 - showed at the beginning that had the
27:19 - version of the header that we want
27:22 - I'm gonna check I'm hoping that in
27:29 - somewhere I have a version number maybe
27:32 - maybe I'm pulling it from the CDN here
27:34 - oh it's it's possible that the code I
27:48 - just copied over the JavaScript have
27:49 - some es6 stuff that's not working I'll
27:53 - have to double-check materialise okay
28:00 - ninety-eight point we could try pulling
28:08 - this version of materialized in to see
28:12 - if if this works better with what we
28:17 - have I mean I'd rather use the newer
28:18 - version if I can but just to get things
28:20 - working at first to try to narrow down
28:23 - the problem I'll bring this in and then
28:32 - Oh comment didn't work off the check
28:43 - what's the hotkey to comment in Visual
28:46 - Studio code I don't know what am i
28:51 - showing this I'm sure this is plain text
28:53 - maybe that's why let's highlight this as
28:59 - HTML yes there we go
29:03 - now let's see if the comment works ok
29:06 - now it works that makes sense ok let's
29:12 - try this then hopefully this address
29:15 - works for the CDN I don't see why it
29:17 - wouldn't and now let's give it a restart
29:22 - and that'll be the last thing we do
29:24 - before I had set the five-minute timer
29:29 - Wow I think we actually have more errors
29:34 - now
29:41 - okay we did get rid of at least one
29:44 - thing that was up there so maybe we
29:47 - don't have more maybe they're just in a
29:49 - different order that's done you know
29:51 - there's not a function
29:59 - I should check to see how many of these
30:01 - errors are happening anyway and yeah
30:10 - actually it will do that after we do all
30:14 - our five minutes a Question and Answer
30:16 - I'm just gonna comment out the things
30:18 - that we've imported and I'm I'm going to
30:22 - see how many errors we have just
30:25 - naturally because some of these may not
30:28 - even be our fault alright so let's take
30:33 - five minute break for questions I'm just
30:38 - going to scroll up to the top of the
30:39 - live chat and go on down the list do as
30:42 - many as I can
30:48 - James says hi there what are you working
30:51 - on just came in here we have an existing
30:57 - site so Franciscan ddu is our existing
31:00 - site it's built on a really old content
31:03 - management system that's a dotnet
31:05 - framework based the system's called
31:08 - Ektron and I have to work within that
31:10 - system to try to make it look nicer be
31:14 - more user friendly and most importantly
31:17 - load faster so right now we're just
31:20 - we're we're working from the top down
31:22 - basically and we've started with the
31:24 - header actually we might the next thing
31:27 - we might do is the footer and then we'll
31:29 - work on the middle we'll see but we just
31:33 - started with the header and working on
31:35 - the side nav as well and so we have hmm
31:44 - sorry this is a big yawn I don't know
31:47 - why I'm yawning so much I got it I got
31:49 - sleep finally last night so anyway we
31:54 - have HTML CSS JavaScript c-sharp some
31:59 - dotnet template things that I don't
32:02 - really know enough about dotnet or a
32:04 - cron to know whether or not this is
32:05 - Ektron specific stuff or whether this is
32:07 - stuff that's common to everything built
32:10 - with dartnet I don't really know but
32:12 - we've been working through and
32:13 - to figure it out and I'm gonna try to
32:15 - make the best of what we can with this
32:18 - site to try to buy us some time until I
32:22 - can clear out the schedule well really
32:25 - my boss can clear out my schedule so I
32:27 - can redo the site completely
32:42 - Sarris Manny says free code camp is
32:45 - amazing yeah it is isn't it and I say
32:49 - that not to say myself is amazing but
32:51 - the everybody the organization as a
32:53 - whole is amazing a lot of awesome
32:58 - volunteers just doing great stuff
33:11 - okay else also says I'm doing my
33:14 - intermediate projects check it out do
33:17 - you have advice for someone who's
33:19 - starting in free code camp my advice if
33:21 - you're starting with the free code camp
33:23 - lessons is do a little bit every day
33:28 - it's much better to work for for it an
33:31 - hour or half-hour every day then - once
33:35 - a week you know do a large chunk like
33:39 - you know even if you did eight hours
33:41 - let's say every Saturday you're much
33:43 - more likely to remember and retain the
33:45 - knowledge if you did a little bit every
33:46 - day instead of just one large thing I
33:49 - mean it's kind of the same thing as
33:51 - working out right if you worked out a
33:53 - little bit every day your body is gonna
33:55 - like that better and you're going to be
33:57 - healthier in the long run than if you
33:58 - just did the crazy workout once a week
34:02 - for one thing you're gonna be really
34:04 - sore if you try to do it like that but
34:09 - your brains I think is the same way and
34:12 - in terms of a little bit of practice
34:16 - frequently is better than a lot of
34:18 - practice infrequently so that's my
34:22 - advice that's my main advice and other
34:23 - than that just stick with it and I would
34:26 - say try your best to do the exercises on
34:29 - your own first
34:30 - because you can definitely find answers
34:33 - for everything you know you can find it
34:36 - out there but I don't you're losing
34:43 - something if you just try to get answers
34:45 - from other people to quickly write your
34:49 - programming is it's not necessarily just
34:54 - about knowing syntax and things like
34:56 - that but it's problem-solving if you're
34:59 - good problem solver all that other stuff
35:00 - can be figured out you know that can be
35:02 - looked up but if you know we'll have all
35:05 - the syntax memorized but you're not a
35:08 - good problem solver you you end up you
35:10 - won't be good you won't make good things
35:12 - because every time you're faced with a
35:15 - new problem you you won't be able to you
35:19 - gonna be able to solve it so anyway
35:22 - those are my
35:24 - if I thought about it more maybe I'd
35:26 - have better advice for you but just kind
35:27 - of off the top of my head just a little
35:29 - bit every day
35:30 - and try to do as much as you can on your
35:32 - own don't let yourself get stuck on one
35:35 - problem for a really really long time
35:37 - like if you you know if you're stuck on
35:40 - one algorithm for days then I'd say you
35:43 - know just move on right but don't give
35:46 - up after five minutes right and I mean
35:50 - it'll be up to your level of patience I
35:52 - guess to decide at what point exactly
35:54 - you would look you know try to get help
35:56 - but I think you just get more out of it
36:00 - if you to really try to do the work
36:03 - yourself
36:11 - okay
36:23 - all right I was just looking I was
36:24 - almost to the bottom of the live chat so
36:26 - I just wanted to scan it really quite
36:27 - see if there's anything else that I
36:31 - should answer right now before we move
36:32 - on
36:42 - okay this is useful John Hanson says you
36:46 - can just update to the latest jQuery is
36:48 - fully backwards compatible that's
36:50 - awesome
37:01 - John also asks have you ever used the
37:03 - step function built into Chrome
37:04 - developer tools for JavaScript debug
37:06 - debugging it helps pinpoint yeah
37:10 - actually I have used it I don't use it
37:13 - often my like fall back is always
37:16 - console.log right I know everybody says
37:19 - that there's better ways to do it but
37:21 - it's just when you have a bug in you're
37:24 - frustrated that's not really the time
37:26 - that you want to try out something new
37:27 - and like have even more trouble trying
37:30 - to figure out a new technique so you
37:31 - just fall back on console look but
37:34 - anyway I'm there's so much stuff going
37:36 - on here that actually might be might be
37:38 - useful all right let me start up my
37:44 - Pomodoro session again and let's I just
37:51 - thought of this I had my live chat on
37:56 - the on this the screen on the side and
37:59 - so I'm constantly looking to the side
38:01 - I'm never really looking at the camera
38:02 - so now I'm gonna move my live chat up to
38:05 - the top of my middle screen my main
38:07 - monitor and then that way it'll be
38:09 - easier to just appear like I'm not
38:13 - talking like off to the side all the
38:15 - time and I'll be more in line with the
38:17 - mic so all right let's see oh okay I
38:23 - know what we're gonna do I'm very
38:25 - curious to see which of these errors is
38:29 - there no matter what we do
38:39 - if anybody listens to Spotify the
38:43 - throwback Thursday playlist this week I
38:46 - was it was a good one it reminds me of
38:49 - when I was in probably sixth grade
38:52 - seventh grade something like that so a
38:56 - lot of memories of former days and Spice
39:00 - Girls were a big deal there were three
39:02 - Spice Girls songs on there so I remember
39:06 - how much everyone loved them interesting
39:20 - it's possible that I removed out
39:24 - carousel I remove the code for the out
39:30 - care or so but didn't get everything
39:33 - let's check this out
39:36 - hero slider aisle carousel what - F
39:39 - which is yeah I can definitely get rid
39:45 - of that because we're not we don't even
39:47 - have that on the page anymore all that
39:50 - stuff okay and main content so it's the
39:54 - end it's at the end of the main content
39:57 - I don't know if that's gonna it's gonna
40:01 - let us check this out in this file but
40:04 - it's worth a shot
40:06 - let's this main master yeah but scroll
40:09 - down now we'll have to check out the
40:18 - main content that component we'll do
40:23 - that later I'm not worried about it but
40:25 - at least we saw that in fact a lot of
40:28 - the errors are probably caused by what
40:30 - we're trying to bring in all right let's
40:34 - try then to use let's try to go with the
40:40 - newer version of materialized and let's
40:43 - bring in a newer version of jQuery and
40:49 - see if we can I don't want to load two
40:52 - at once so let's see where that other
40:54 - version was so much stuff
41:12 - where are they pulling that in
41:18 - whoa maybe I'm not bringing jQuery in
41:22 - anywhere this was commented out that's
41:30 - interesting it's possible that jQuery is
41:32 - being brought in somewhere else let me
41:34 - let me check because I don't know why I
41:40 - would have completely commented out J
41:43 - quick
41:55 - thank is this and whoa tickly tickly -
42:00 - unless what that is and this is okay
42:06 - that's just our materialize it's
42:08 - Facebook stuff interesting let's go to
42:12 - our network JavaScript
42:23 - see here we go so we do have jQuery I
42:27 - have no idea what version of jQuery this
42:29 - is jQuery 1.10.10 in it alright let's
42:48 - check our jQuery thought Min Dutch ass
43:09 - it's in the head
43:13 - we should be able to see this why are we
43:20 - seeing this
43:45 - okay I guess it's being brought in by
43:53 - something in here
44:00 - meta data
44:09 - let's check out where this metadata is
44:12 - coming from
44:35 - you
44:48 - actually let's check out shake this out
44:52 - soon and see mater there we go metadata
44:59 - one is coming from here
45:24 - okay so we have
45:39 - all right I'm I'm checking the live chat
45:43 - real quick see if anyone said anything
46:13 - okay
46:19 - how much I'm not sure what's getting
46:22 - pulled in here
46:33 - I mean I assumed that this was where
46:37 - everything was getting pulled in from I
46:39 - could check it again okay so this
46:46 - favorite shortcut icons is this here
46:50 - so between viewport and favorite
46:54 - shortcut icons everything is getting
46:56 - pulled in by this eye so I assume so all
47:01 - of this so all of this is getting pulled
47:07 - in from somewhere else
47:16 - interesting
47:31 - okay all right so Umberto says he's
47:39 - never seen that so he's guessing that
47:41 - it's something from my CMS I yeah let's
47:45 - I'm gonna try one more thing
47:56 - oops
48:00 - I don't want that us once that and let's
48:12 - see Wow there we go
48:17 - let's see where else we can find this
48:45 - okay
49:08 - Wow this this is in a lot of places I
49:14 - don't think the tests these seem like
49:18 - they're all tests so let's scroll up a
49:21 - bit test as inflated for control
49:34 - I don't share this one up
49:59 - okay
50:13 - this does look like a lot of what was
50:15 - being yeah you know what this is not I
50:26 - don't think this is being used anymore
50:28 - because I've removed this code unless
50:31 - there's some part of the site that is
50:33 - still being used that I don't have found
50:35 - which is possible but in any case this
50:37 - is not where that's being brought in
50:39 - front you can see this this site is kind
50:48 - of a maze with all the stuff going on
51:03 - these all look like they're tests
51:24 - ooh
51:34 - it was fine page layout
51:41 - just feel like following a trail here
51:45 - wait a second why is that already in
51:49 - there yeah all right
51:57 - being able to search through all those
52:00 - the whole project at once is so useful
52:04 - all right
52:27 - I think
52:30 - this is not what we're looking for all
52:33 - right so let's go back to what we had
52:35 - before
52:38 - what are you looking at here
52:50 - before we looking for
52:55 - jQuery is so we want to find
53:06 - it's a page layout PB test SPX and then
53:13 - CMS login we could try CMS login or PB
53:22 - test all right
53:30 - you would think that a test page would
53:32 - not be something live but this is the
53:34 - file structure and this is weird in the
53:36 - names of files so I'm not gonna take
53:38 - take for granted that that would is
53:41 - probably not anything live let's try it
53:49 - out
54:09 - last one which I think it was that yeah
54:23 - all right let's see
54:36 - actually not I think about it I do I
54:42 - would have all the login stuff here so
54:44 - let me open this up in an incognito
54:47 - window so that I get rid of all the
54:51 - login stuff I mean I probably should
54:55 - worry about the login stuff at some
54:56 - point because people are still gonna
54:58 - have to you know login but most people
55:01 - won't so for now just to make
55:03 - troubleshooting easier we're gonna try
55:07 - to not have all this stuff load
55:09 - hopefully it doesn't load for users who
55:13 - who aren't logged in there we go
55:28 - well
55:38 - that's interesting
55:42 - all right let's check out elements
55:50 - jQuery wow it is still loading this
56:16 - that's interesting it's not in there
56:19 - anyway you know those those test files
56:24 - were actually now that I think about it
56:27 - they're probably testing what gets
56:28 - rendered so that's not where we want to
56:32 - look anyway we're interested in where
56:39 - this this metadata is I'm sure we
56:47 - bringing this in here at all no no I
56:51 - forgot we're bringing it in from the
56:53 - other place okay
57:53 - okay
57:56 - I'm not sure I'm not sure right now
58:01 - where that is coming from so yeah let's
58:08 - let's try to do something and then I can
58:11 - search for that later on actually let me
58:16 - see I'm Barrett oh saying a lot of stuff
58:17 - and I know then he knows c-sharp so let
58:21 - me check out what he's saying yeah it
58:30 - says whoa are they importing them in
58:31 - each page individually this one is not
58:35 - using master that's a relief to hear
58:37 - that it's not being used no wonder
58:39 - people don't like dotnet MBC is much
58:41 - better organized in my opinion yeah yeah
58:46 - and you know what honestly it's it's the
58:50 - organization of a lot of stuff is not
58:53 - great a lot of our older stuff is just
58:56 - not great so it's it's not even
58:58 - necessarily the fact that it's dotnet
59:01 - it's just there's a lot of stuff going
59:06 - on on top of like the Ektron system and
59:10 - then we had it modified I mean I wasn't
59:12 - here for this from from what I've heard
59:14 - when it was first put in place it was
59:16 - then modified by the company that set it
59:18 - up with some some custom things then
59:21 - people that worked here tried to patch
59:24 - it up and fix it and make it do other
59:26 - things and so there's a lot of stuff
59:30 - going on and there's no consistency in
59:32 - naming or anything it's um
59:35 - there are literally pages that someone
59:39 - like winning and viewed source and
59:41 - copied all this stuff and then use that
59:43 - as the template for a page and then
59:47 - popped in so it's just weird there's
59:49 - weird stuff going on so we're gonna run
59:53 - into stuff like this so but I mean I
59:57 - like I you know the whole point of this
60:00 - stream like I frequently say is just to
60:03 - see what it's like you know what my day
60:05 - is like and I imagine I'm not the only
60:08 - developer that
60:09 - to come in and work with legacy systems
60:11 - and you know can't just start from
60:13 - scratch so the last project and the
60:16 - project before that we were able to
60:18 - basically start from scratch and just
60:19 - build it up and that's awesome we can
60:22 - make all the decisions on how we want to
60:24 - build it unfortunately for this one we
60:26 - can't so it's definitely it's fun to try
60:30 - to have to hunt for things and see how
60:32 - it was done as long as I can find it in
60:35 - the end it's it's fun but it can make
60:38 - things slow and frustrating all right so
60:45 - let's um let's try bringing in another
60:51 - version of jQuery and let's just see
60:55 - what happens so I think I have
60:59 - materialized most of that below here huh
61:04 - yeah some materialized here I guess I
61:10 - can get rid of that and I can get rid of
61:12 - that and they had whoops
61:20 - under getting started I think they had a
61:22 - link yeah so let's just use this for now
61:28 - since that's the one that they were
61:30 - recommending and I don't want to like in
61:39 - production use two versions of jQuery
61:41 - but I just want to see what's what we
61:47 - can do right now to get things at least
61:50 - working a little bit and then try to
61:53 - mess mess around from there and see if
61:57 - we can get something that works it's not
62:06 - working
62:10 - oh okay we got some different things now
62:22 - mmm
62:30 - I do wonder why while we're getting some
62:35 - of this stuff whoops
62:45 - I'm wondering where this is coming from
62:58 - interesting
63:05 - this shouldn't be pulled in right now
63:07 - right maybe maybe there's this stuff
63:13 - that we put in down here is pulling this
63:15 - ends though oh yeah nondescript stuff
63:33 - we're not in the main one sorry I was
63:36 - looking at the wrong thing yet you need
63:41 - to go to the main nav
63:51 - so actually I think yeah it's probably
63:54 - coming from here we're still pulling
63:58 - these in
64:21 - it's
64:25 - fixes
64:36 - okay
64:43 - yeah I think it's this
64:51 - okay
65:06 - actually it shouldn't be right where do
65:10 - we put this uh so this is inside the
65:12 - header so it should not be outputting
65:15 - anything outside the header right this
65:18 - is where it ends
65:35 - all right my timer is up so I'm gonna
65:38 - finish this up in just a minute
65:58 - I just want to see what is over here I
66:03 - think what it was probably happening is
66:07 - that side nav takes up space and then
66:12 - the JavaScript in materialized pushes it
66:17 - over and that JavaScript we're getting
66:21 - an error and it's not running and so
66:23 - this is staying out so it's pushing
66:25 - everything over and so that's why I mean
66:29 - this button doesn't work right because
66:30 - this never initializes since
66:32 - everything's pushed over that's why this
66:34 - is going off the side there so I think
66:37 - that's our problem our main problem is
66:40 - the JavaScript just is not running
66:43 - because it looks like all the CSS is
66:46 - fine right we're still getting we were
66:51 - getting some weird stuff from what's
66:53 - already there so you can see on hover
66:55 - it's changing the blue which it
66:56 - shouldn't do so but other than those few
67:00 - things our CSS is fine
67:06 - it's just the JavaScript it's not
67:08 - running
67:26 - can I try
67:44 - let's try
67:49 - wanna try this with our new version of
67:52 - jQuery and see if it makes a difference
68:07 - okay no difference there and last thing
68:12 - and then I'll be done let's not use this
68:15 - version of jQuery and instead let's
68:20 - uncomment that
68:31 - no still still not working
68:43 - although actually this is I had
68:45 - forgotten that this is the way it works
68:47 - but whatever version of jQuery we load
68:50 - last seems to be the version that it's
68:52 - trying to use so let's get to know I
68:58 - want to get rid of this because really I
69:01 - mean this is the only error that we're
69:04 - getting right now
69:18 - so I also figure out where this is and
69:20 - remove it
69:33 - the others checking to see if it wasn't
69:36 - that al carousel wasn't loading anywhere
69:39 - else but I'm gonna see it okay all right
69:45 - now it's time for questions and I'm I
69:53 - think I got through a lot of them so it
69:55 - probably won't be a very long
69:57 - question-and-answer session so if you
69:59 - have a question you think about asking
70:00 - it put it in there now because once I
70:03 - get to the bottom I'll probably go on
70:06 - for like three minutes longer than I
70:07 - should and then I'll end and turn the
70:10 - stream off but I don't want you to miss
70:14 - out in case you want to ask something so
70:16 - if you're not interested in the question
70:18 - answer session thank you so much for
70:19 - watching and I'll be back tomorrow so
70:22 - hopefully you can join in then if you
70:25 - don't have a question but you are
70:27 - knowledgeable and like to help answer
70:28 - questions that would be awesome it's
70:31 - definitely way better when we get a
70:33 - variety of of opinions and in answers
70:37 - right I mean we can't all be experts at
70:39 - everything so it's better when we have
70:42 - people that know about different areas
70:46 - all right so let's let's go oh you know
70:51 - what I just remembered
70:52 - I told you I told you all at the
70:54 - beginning that I was going to show you
70:56 - what I did on project two because I
71:00 - thought it was really interesting so let
71:01 - me take I'm only gonna spend at most
71:03 - five minutes on this so I'm setting my
71:05 - five minute timer so I don't keep going
71:07 - for too long and let me show you as
71:12 - quickly as I can what I've done so
71:16 - here's our service request form okay and
71:19 - I've added in a few things so now
71:21 - they're automatically if you mark a
71:23 - field is required and asterisk is going
71:25 - to be there so that's I don't know it's
71:36 - it's a simple improvement but I'll show
71:38 - you how I did it in in react I mean it's
71:40 - kind of cool it's not super complex but
71:42 - I just like how it's done also I've
71:45 - added this if you click
71:47 - photography now you have two more
71:49 - required fields that pop up so and some
71:55 - of them don't and some of them do but
71:58 - this was some feedback I got earlier
72:01 - today that the video people and the
72:05 - people in charge of photography both
72:06 - want more information but it doesn't
72:10 - apply to everything so I thought that
72:12 - was kind of cool so I just want to show
72:16 - you oh the other thing that I did was I
72:18 - changed the field the validation so I
72:21 - don't know if you remember I think this
72:22 - happened once before if I were to do
72:24 - something like this and have a space it
72:26 - would have marked the name as being
72:29 - invalid so it's not it wasn't obvious
72:35 - from the name of the validation that it
72:38 - would do that but it did so I had to
72:41 - change it from like alpha to is words
72:45 - something like that and if you change it
72:47 - to is words then it lets you put spaces
72:50 - so a lot of these I just removed the
72:52 - validation completely because there
72:54 - really wasn't anything built into
72:56 - formzee that would fit because really in
73:02 - these you know primary target audience I
73:05 - they could type a paragraph that had
73:07 - numbers letters special characters at
73:09 - that point what am I really you know
73:11 - trying to validate there and remember
73:14 - write the validation client-side is
73:15 - really nothing nothing to do with
73:17 - security because people can get around
73:18 - it it's more just to be helpful to the
73:20 - user so anyway so I decided to take off
73:25 - the validation except for some obvious
73:27 - places like email phone actually I took
73:32 - it off a phone too because somebody
73:34 - might put want to put their extension
73:36 - here so they might write ext period and
73:38 - then a number which would be invalid so
73:41 - anyway so I took it off of a lot of them
73:44 - but it's really nice that it will be on
73:46 - email though and then that way it'll
73:48 - force people if they accidentally mess
73:50 - up their email or something I mean it
73:53 - won't check if they misspell something
73:55 - but at least it'll if they left out a
73:58 - dot or
73:59 - something really important would it
74:01 - would let them know all right so here's
74:05 - how I did it whoops okay so I've added
74:16 - in in in the data for the check boxes
74:20 - this is the coolest thing I did so I'm
74:23 - going to show this just to make sure I
74:24 - get it in I've added in this conditional
74:27 - fields that's an array of objects and
74:29 - you see the objects are exactly the same
74:31 - data that I'm passing in up here for the
74:35 - other text boxes right so I've added
74:41 - into the service request form here where
74:45 - we have check boxes and right so here's
74:49 - where we're pulling in the check boxes
74:55 - there's some more space here so you can
74:57 - see so within this right where we're
75:04 - checking for all that data in here the
75:06 - check box data in here and where we're
75:08 - looping over that and when we get down
75:12 - to here I check to see if there are
75:14 - conditional fields if there are
75:15 - conditional fields then I check to see
75:22 - through this state ok I check to see if
75:30 - the check box is checked
75:33 - that's what this does okay that's not
75:35 - really obvious right away but that's
75:36 - what this is doing so it checks the
75:39 - check box and so if there are
75:42 - conditional fields for that particular
75:43 - check box data and then if the check box
75:47 - is checked then it renders everything
75:51 - that's under conditional fields so since
75:53 - it's an array of objects we can do a map
75:55 - on there and then we map and we just
75:57 - pull in that same formzee text component
76:00 - that we've used at the top for the you
76:02 - know for the name email and all that and
76:04 - then we just pass in our props and since
76:07 - we we did it the same way I guess this
76:09 - is almost completely the same
76:12 - I've added some different styles just
76:16 - because of where they're at in between
76:17 - those checkboxes and I've also added in
76:22 - for the required we have for the
76:25 - floating label Texas field field
76:26 - required if if it's true then we do
76:30 - field name plus and asterisk if it's
76:33 - false we just put field name so that's
76:35 - how I did those asterisks as well yeah
76:42 - so that's how I ended up doing it I
76:43 - tried a couple different ways before
76:44 - that that didn't work and then it
76:46 - finally hit me that this was the
76:47 - simplest way and it would work and I
76:49 - can't believe I didn't think of it
76:51 - sooner so I actually tried like passing
76:53 - in all of this stuff as data in a string
76:58 - which was ridiculous and obviously
76:59 - didn't work and I tried putting this in
77:04 - in our icon check box thing but then I
77:07 - would have to been passing information
77:09 - back and forth about the state of of
77:16 - those text fields right because remember
77:17 - they're controlled components so right
77:20 - we're putting in the value whatever gets
77:22 - typed in there goes into state and then
77:24 - the value of that input comes from state
77:27 - right so I'd have to pass that back and
77:28 - forth from the parent component which
77:30 - was service request AAS so that was
77:33 - ridiculous as well when the simple thing
77:37 - was just to put it in there
77:39 - unfortunately that was the third thing I
77:40 - thought of but it was still cool to go
77:43 - through here and just kind of see what's
77:44 - possible and not possible so anyway just
77:49 - thought I'd share that with you all the
77:51 - it's all on github now so if you want to
77:54 - check it out a little bit more detail
77:56 - you can do that all right now I will go
78:00 - to the questions and let's see I got to
78:07 - figure out where I left off it
78:20 - okay Carlos asked what version of jQuery
78:22 - I'm using I assume that you saw
78:25 - embarrassed this looks like 1.1 yeah so
78:27 - there are multiple types so there was I
78:30 - commented out one one point eleven
78:33 - something and then so it was falling
78:34 - back to an older version one point ten
78:37 - something to the evidently I was using
78:41 - one point ten without realizing it at
78:43 - first and then you know we tried we
78:46 - tried at version three nothing gave us
78:50 - the result that we wanted so off to do
78:52 - some more troubleshooting
79:16 - okay Evo says or I bow I'm not sure I'm
79:21 - not sure which way to pronounce that
79:25 - it's Ivo says hi Jessie long time no see
79:28 - the good old memories working with
79:30 - asp.net in school still haunt me to this
79:35 - day
79:36 - hey I just noticed my camera didn't
79:39 - freeze up at all during the stream so
79:41 - hopefully it lasts and I'm still going
79:43 - to try to use my phone next time but I'm
79:46 - glad I didn't have to restart it
80:00 - all right so uh Abdul Azeez says hi
80:04 - Jesse is it not possible to work with
80:08 - the computer I see you are working with
80:11 - two computers another question is what
80:15 - is the difference between free code camp
80:17 - and github
80:18 - okay so Ebola answered the saying github
80:22 - is a code repository storing code and
80:27 - free code campus community of developers
80:28 - yeah yeah that's that's pretty much it
80:31 - right you can store your code using git
80:34 - on github
80:36 - yeah and free code camp is a lot of
80:39 - different things go on I think its main
80:40 - the main thing it's known for is its
80:43 - courses so it's coding exercises but
80:47 - there's also a lot more going on now so
80:49 - they have a really active forum they
80:51 - have medium publication so lots of blogs
80:57 - and then of course we have the YouTube
81:00 - channel now that's really picked up and
81:01 - we we have a lot of videos every week
81:04 - and yeah so it's just we a loved one or
81:08 - not and then there are also groups free
81:11 - code camp groups that meet up frequently
81:15 - so all over the world so this it's a lot
81:20 - we got a lot going on and also I'm not I
81:26 - don't understand what you mean by your
81:27 - first question about working with two
81:30 - computers are you saying I think I'm
81:37 - trying to see if you can see my other
81:39 - computer in the background if that's
81:41 - what you're talking about I do mainly
81:44 - just work with one computer and that's
81:46 - fine one computer with three monitors
81:49 - and then the computer behind me is just
81:52 - an old Windows laptop connected to an
81:55 - external monitor so I don't go crazy
81:58 - trying to do things on one screen and I
82:01 - just use that for testing and in fact
82:03 - something happened and it isn't
82:06 - connecting to the internet anymore so it
82:08 - hasn't been able to connect to the
82:09 - for at least six months so I really
82:11 - haven't even used it and I think I'm
82:13 - better off because it's so old I'm
82:15 - afraid it'll get a virus if I try to
82:17 - connect to the internet anyway it's just
82:19 - and it's super slow so I don't really
82:22 - need to use it that much anymore because
82:24 - I have browser stack for testing and
82:27 - it's faster for me just to open browser
82:30 - stack on this computer and test then to
82:33 - get that thing started up and connected
82:38 - anyway I assume that's what you were
82:41 - referring to if not let me know and
82:44 - maybe clarify a little bit more for me
82:53 - nova glow asks what kind of degree or
82:56 - training did you get to become a
82:57 - developer okay so my training was for
83:09 - the most part informal I do have I have
83:13 - a video on my channel the links in the
83:14 - description on how I became a front-end
83:16 - developer so if you want a more in-depth
83:19 - answer I think that's maybe like I don't
83:22 - know a 10 to 15 minute video of me
83:24 - talking about it but basically other
83:26 - than a little bit of training in HTML
83:30 - and CSS in high school and one
83:32 - programming course in college where we
83:35 - use C++ all of my training has been just
83:39 - online either taking mostly free courses
83:43 - online reading you know reading blogs
83:46 - reading free JavaScript books
83:49 - documentation things like that and just
83:52 - learning by trial and error on a lot of
83:54 - projects I was lucky enough to have
83:59 - basically the role of a subcontract
84:02 - subcontractor for a lot of things so I
84:04 - got a lot of work doing just so many
84:07 - different things you know relating to
84:09 - websites everything from writing blogs
84:11 - for companies doing SEO work all the way
84:13 - to JavaScript stuff and I get paid for
84:17 - that and I was able to spend a lot of
84:19 - time learning and
84:20 - didn't have to worry about billing
84:21 - clients or trying to market myself or
84:23 - going to meetings or anything like that
84:25 - because I had someone else that was
84:28 - doing all that I got paid a little less
84:30 - because of it but it freed me up to
84:33 - spend a lot of time being able to learn
84:36 - and get paid while I was doing it so
84:38 - that's that's mostly where I really went
84:41 - through a lot of my learning now that
84:42 - I'm employed full-time as a front-end
84:44 - developer I've learned a lot while I'm
84:46 - going through projects and sometimes if
84:48 - things are a little bit slower I can
84:50 - spend some time like doing more targeted
84:52 - learning so doing some free code camp
84:54 - exercises or catching up on you know
84:57 - videos from from conferences that are on
85:00 - YouTube and things like that sometimes
85:03 - I'm able to take some time you know
85:05 - maybe like on my lunch break or
85:08 - something I watch some tutorial videos
85:10 - so just here and there I picked things
85:12 - up you know when I needed although I am
85:14 - taking a Udacity nano degree course
85:16 - that's about the closest thing to formal
85:18 - training that I've that I've had so
85:21 - anyway like I said you can watch that
85:24 - video too if you want to hear some more
85:26 - about it and I didn't mention my I just
85:34 - looked at your question again you asked
85:35 - what kind of degree I had I have a
85:36 - degree in business so it's not really
85:40 - related to confuse
86:01 - whoa Evo Eva just had a great idea I
86:06 - love this idea so Eva says you can also
86:11 - try to hack it by overriding the jQuery
86:14 - nsj file in the UX folder but that is
86:18 - just the ultimate hack I like that that
86:22 - is like it's it's a little bit sneaky
86:25 - but it's it's so simple that's like the
86:29 - I still would like to know where it's
86:31 - coming from cuz it'll always bug me if I
86:33 - don't find out but just to get things to
86:37 - the point where we aren't loading a
86:39 - bunch of different versions of jQuery
86:40 - and we have a new version that's that's
86:44 - a great idea I'll just keep a backup of
86:46 - the other version in case it breaks a
86:48 - bunch of stuff which it shouldn't but
86:51 - all right I think that's that's the best
86:55 - idea that I've heard today
87:09 - John Hanson says would it be a good idea
87:11 - to comment out the template variables
87:13 - then bring them back one by one unless
87:15 - there are too many of them yeah actually
87:19 - I thought about doing that I think if we
87:23 - had more time I probably would have done
87:24 - it because that right we're kind of
87:27 - getting towards the end there I'm gonna
87:31 - say I'm I'm gonna do a lot of a lot of
87:34 - searching so we'll see we'll see what's
87:39 - going on I think I'm right after the
87:42 - stream I'm gonna stop working on on my
87:44 - work stuff and I'm gonna start working
87:46 - on my project for Udacity but then
87:49 - tomorrow when I come in I think all
87:51 - morning I'll either be searching for the
87:56 - answer to this or I'll be finishing up
87:58 - some things on that Resource Center on
88:00 - project to which there's not really that
88:04 - much left to do but hopefully I'll find
88:07 - it and then we can actually work on
88:10 - something I'm running out of titles to
88:13 - put in my video I just put it in today's
88:15 - video about the side nav I'll just have
88:17 - to put part two at the end I guess
88:27 - oh okay
88:30 - John Hanson said I could browse our hard
88:33 - reload to clear the cache if it's
88:35 - holding on to jQuery version actually
88:37 - that's a good idea but I think I have it
88:39 - yeah yeah I have it so that if I have
88:43 - dev tools open nothing gets cached so
88:46 - that's really helpful so check out that
88:48 - setting if you if you're not familiar
88:51 - with it already because you almost never
88:53 - want the cache working when you're
88:56 - developing so so nothing should have
88:59 - been cached I'll probably try it though
89:07 - later on because you never know I mean
89:09 - it's uh it's always worth trying too
89:11 - hard refresh just in case Shay says hey
89:21 - Jesse thanks for these thanks for the
89:23 - videos would you mind giving a brief
89:24 - description of doing local development
89:26 - versus using code pen or cloud 9 etc or
89:32 - could you point to the best place to
89:34 - read up on how to do a simple project
89:36 - locally set up the local O's for testing
89:39 - etc okay yeah I'll try to explain this
89:43 - briefly also so at the end of those
89:46 - sentences is etc' period right which is
89:50 - etc now this is totally unrelated to
89:53 - code but you may have heard from
89:57 - previous streams that I used to teach
90:00 - Latin right and that's a Latin word at
90:02 - cetera but it always bugs me when I hear
90:05 - it because everybody except for one
90:07 - person I've ever heard pronounces it etc
90:09 - but if I were teaching Latin and I
90:12 - wanted to say that I would say etc right
90:15 - so I don't want to say it like that and
90:17 - sound weird so I still say etc but
90:21 - anyway it always bothers me so this I
90:25 - basically still want to know does anyone
90:27 - else pronounce it like the proper Latin
90:30 - way I'm wondering especially like people
90:32 - whose
90:34 - maybe a Romance language is their first
90:37 - language I'm thinking they would be more
90:39 - likely to pronounce it properly and
90:41 - maybe it's just Americans speaking
90:44 - English they can't pronounce it right I
90:45 - don't know anyway
90:47 - and Latin has multiple pronunciations
90:50 - depending on what type of Latin you're
90:52 - studying so I guess it's I shouldn't be
90:55 - too weird about it all right so I'm
91:04 - gonna try to take there are a couple
91:05 - parts to this question so I guess I'll
91:09 - talk about the doing like cloud
91:12 - development like in browser development
91:15 - with code pen and cloud 9 so I would say
91:18 - this code pen in cloud 9 urns are in two
91:20 - different classes right so in terms of
91:24 - ease of use I'd say there's like a
91:25 - spectrum right and the easiest would be
91:29 - something like code pen or jsfiddle
91:34 - would also be in there I think there's
91:36 - some other ones but basically you just
91:38 - can write code and immediately see the
91:41 - result usually you have like three
91:43 - windows one for HTML one for CSS and one
91:46 - for JavaScript like three little frames
91:49 - and then there's another frame that
91:51 - shows the result it's super easy so
91:54 - basically you're just working with three
91:56 - files it does let you import other
91:58 - libraries and it's actually really easy
92:00 - to do in code pen I haven't used a
92:02 - fiddle in a long time so it might be
92:03 - easy in there as well but there are some
92:07 - limitations right I mean you're you're
92:09 - limited I would never do a really big
92:12 - project in there right with that needed
92:14 - a complex folder structure as last time
92:19 - I use something on code pen like you
92:21 - can't host files there you have to
92:24 - import them also so it's limited but
92:27 - it's really easy you just need a browser
92:29 - to get started and then a little bit
92:31 - harder to use is cloud9 or things like
92:35 - cloud 9 where you have what basically
92:39 - looks like what you see on on the screen
92:41 - right now but it runs in your browser
92:43 - all right which is actually kind of
92:45 - interesting because this
92:46 - is running on chromium right I think the
92:49 - s code is an electron app so technically
92:52 - this is running in a browser - right so
92:55 - but anyway you you all probably know
92:58 - what I'm talking about right it's not
93:01 - running in this is running on my
93:03 - computer essentially like a native
93:07 - desktop app but cloud9 would run in your
93:11 - browser you'd open up your browser you
93:12 - type in the URL it's c9 IO login and
93:17 - there you are and you'd see something
93:18 - like this and you'd actually see I got
93:20 - rid of it on Visual Studio code but at
93:23 - the bottom you would see a terminal that
93:26 - you could type real commands and it's a
93:28 - Linux server so you could type in all
93:31 - your normal Linux commands you can load
93:33 - things with NPM you have all your folder
93:38 - structure over here and you have your
93:40 - code here and you also could have
93:41 - another window to have the live preview
93:44 - and you could split the window out in
93:46 - fact and you know put it on another
93:48 - screen if you want but it basically
93:51 - completely mimics your local development
93:54 - environment you're still somewhat
93:57 - limited because I guess it depends on
94:01 - what version if you pay for you know
94:03 - faster server more space it could be
94:08 - really nice but you still have you
94:12 - you're going through the internet right
94:13 - so there's always going to be that I
94:15 - guess would you call latency right then
94:17 - that lag I mean it's not bad if you had
94:19 - a good connection but you have to be
94:23 - connected so you couldn't you couldn't
94:27 - develop you know offline like that
94:32 - the Third Way and then maybe there's
94:35 - more ways that I don't know about is
94:37 - you've developed locally and I may I say
94:39 - that's the hardest because you have to
94:42 - set up cloud 9 sets up a lot for you but
94:45 - locally you have to set everything up
94:46 - like if you want to develop let's say
94:48 - react like we are doing for our last two
94:50 - projects you'd have to have a computer I
94:53 - mean it doesn't really matter if it's
94:54 - Windows or Linux or Mac but you'd have a
94:57 - computer you need to be able to install
94:59 - node
95:00 - in npm and then you need to install all
95:05 - your your other packages yourself it's
95:11 - on your machine it's taking up your
95:13 - space on your computer like you know you
95:16 - have to have a separate terminal I mean
95:19 - a lot of like Visual Studio code comes
95:21 - with the terminal and stuff but to be
95:22 - honest with you I'm Way more satisfied
95:24 - with using I term two separately then
95:27 - using this I mean especially if I want
95:30 - to do some stuff in the terminal and I'm
95:31 - not actually using atom or Visual Studio
95:33 - code I don't have to open that up just
95:36 - to do it so so now you have two
95:39 - different programs right you're running
95:41 - us you got to run a server on your own
95:44 - machine to do local development so you
95:45 - can see like it just grows in complexity
95:49 - the cool thing though about cloud 9 and
95:54 - things like cloud 9 are that you could
95:56 - potentially do like real development
95:59 - with you know loading and PIM packages
96:01 - and all kinds of cool things that you
96:03 - couldn't do with code pen but you could
96:06 - do it on something like a Chromebook
96:08 - where you know you normally don't have
96:10 - access to load something like node and
96:13 - an NPM and all that stuff on a
96:14 - Chromebook I know there are ways to
96:16 - unlock it but let's say you didn't want
96:19 - to void your warranty you could do it in
96:22 - browser potentially you could do it on a
96:25 - tablet it would probably be harder
96:27 - depending on what kind of tablet you had
96:29 - but you know you could do it there I've
96:31 - never tried to open up cloud 9 on a
96:34 - phone but that I mean it might be
96:36 - possible so anyway hopefully that helps
96:39 - that ended up being a really long answer
96:41 - I probably could have made a whole video
96:43 - out of that but anyway that's that's my
96:48 - opinion on that also the other part of
96:53 - that question was could you point to the
96:56 - best place to read up on how to do
96:57 - simple project locally set up a local
97:00 - host for testing I would
97:08 - trying to think where I saw I I would
97:14 - like to do some videos on that but I'm
97:16 - they're not doing them yet as you all
97:18 - you all know who's been watching I
97:20 - really want to do a lot more videos but
97:22 - I just have not had time so I don't know
97:25 - when that'll happen but until then I
97:27 - think we'll stern who does the what is
97:33 - it learn code Academy YouTube channel
97:36 - will stern made a bunch of videos on
97:40 - setting up development environments and
97:42 - things but they're kind of a little bit
97:45 - older than maybe a few years old so but
97:48 - it'll get a lot of the concepts will be
97:51 - there right I mean he goes into like
97:53 - webpack but he also goes over gulp and
97:56 - grunt and things like that so you'll
97:58 - you'll get an idea for what's out there
98:00 - and how to do it and then you can maybe
98:04 - read up on some newer things if you want
98:06 - to but you should be able to get the
98:07 - basics there you know if you like that I
98:10 - don't I don't really know of anything
98:12 - offhand like for you to read I'm sure
98:15 - there's a lot of good stuff out there I
98:16 - just learned how to do all that from
98:19 - YouTube videos but that's a good place
98:21 - to go and let me know if you have any
98:26 - other question if you try it out and
98:27 - have other questions and stuff just let
98:29 - me know in the live chat or you can
98:31 - message me on Twitter or something and
98:33 - help you out if I can okay just a few
98:40 - more things here in the live chat I'm
98:42 - down to the bottom now Ali says let's
98:46 - see okay this was in response to someone
98:53 - else's question in the live chat so I'm
98:54 - not gonna I'm not gonna read that okay
99:00 - ebo says sometimes with these kinds of
99:01 - projects I just feel it saves you a lot
99:03 - of stress and hassle if you just start
99:05 - over I definitely agree and if I could I
99:11 - would just start developing the new site
99:13 - right away honestly I think it's
99:19 - somewhat of a waste of time
99:20 - for me to do this now because I hope to
99:23 - redo the main site within the next like
99:26 - year or so and oh hey I think my
99:29 - daughter is at the door so hold on a
99:31 - second me open the door look you can see
99:45 - Thanks there you go yeah the cameras
99:57 - right over that green light is yeah so
100:01 - what do you think you're gonna say
100:04 - something there the people on YouTube on
100:08 - YouTube there are 21 people watching
100:11 - right now yeah so this is Gemma my
100:17 - daughter Gemma and this is my son
100:19 - Raphael up here so they they just
100:22 - brought me some food because I'm gonna
100:23 - stay here at the office late and work on
100:26 - my my project for Udacity so it's a lot
100:30 - easier to get worked on here at home
100:33 - there's too many kids I normally like
100:36 - having all the kids around but not if at
100:38 - work to do just let you come in by
100:42 - yourself but I kind of couldn't do well
100:47 - I'm gonna finish up my youtube show now
100:49 - do you guys have to go
101:05 - okay alright that was fun
101:09 - um yeah my daughter Gemma wants to be
101:13 - like a YouTube chef like make cakes and
101:17 - stuff so there's a youtuber named Gemma
101:21 - whose show her show is cupcake Gemma and
101:23 - she has like some bakeries in England
101:26 - and my daughter Gemma loves that show so
101:29 - well maybe one day I'll make Gemma
101:32 - YouTube channel I bought her all kind of
101:33 - baking stuff for her birthday it was at
101:36 - the end of August so so we'll see anyway
101:40 - I'll give you back to the coating now to
101:43 - only only have just maybe two questions
101:47 - left
101:48 - oh okay so the last thing Evo was saying
101:53 - it's better just to start over sometimes
101:57 - okay now I remember already basically my
102:00 - opinion is that I should not be trying
102:02 - to fix this site that instead I should
102:05 - just start on the new site and we could
102:08 - probably get a new site up and running
102:10 - and like probably I'm gonna say like six
102:15 - months not that it would take me six
102:17 - months but just there are so many people
102:20 - that are going to be involved in making
102:21 - decisions on that that I know it will
102:25 - take forever to get approval for stuff
102:27 - so because really we've already done
102:33 - stuff even on this stream that we could
102:35 - use to build our own site like if we
102:38 - took if we took what we did for that
102:41 - project one right and use next J as some
102:44 - server-side rendering with next and and
102:47 - react and just linked it up with a
102:49 - content management system through an API
102:52 - like WordPress or something else then we
102:55 - basically have the site I mean the main
102:58 - site right now Franciscan ddu has like
103:01 - three thousand plus pages maybe more
103:03 - than that but in reality they're you
103:06 - know we don't create all those pages
103:08 - right we create a home page template and
103:10 - then just a few other templates for the
103:12 - different types of pages and then those
103:14 - just
103:14 - populated with data from the content
103:17 - management system so the hardest part of
103:19 - that whole process would just be getting
103:20 - the data that's in the extra on CMS
103:23 - right now and getting it transferred to
103:27 - something better I don't want it to stay
103:30 - on there I don't want it to be hosted on
103:34 - campus anymore because it's it's slow
103:36 - the time the first byte is just
103:38 - unacceptable so that's the biggest thing
103:42 - and once I have that down actually
103:44 - developing the site it's not really a
103:46 - big deal so to me you know spending
103:50 - weeks on this is just kind of it's time
103:55 - that I could that I could already have
103:57 - that other site ready so I mean yeah
104:01 - I'll get this done a little bit faster
104:03 - and there'll be a slight increase in
104:05 - speed it'll look nicer but right now
104:09 - it's just like it's it's like putting a
104:12 - bandaid on something like underneath
104:14 - still needs it's it's still damaged it
104:17 - still needs work it's you know it's
104:18 - still slow yeah so anyway that's that's
104:24 - my opinion about this and so and I'm I'm
104:30 - comfortable saying this on YouTube
104:31 - because I've already said this to my
104:33 - boss and this other people that that
104:36 - work here's but that's how it is right
104:42 - when you when you work with other people
104:44 - you can't always do it however you want
104:46 - to do it sometimes you got a you know
104:48 - you got to wait and you got to do other
104:49 - things and anyway so we'll do the best
104:53 - we can you know and I think it's gonna
104:58 - it's going to be good and people are
105:01 - gonna be impressed users are gonna have
105:03 - a great a much better experience so is
105:05 - it is it the best thing we could do
105:06 - right now
105:07 - no but it's gonna it's gonna be better
105:13 - ok Tony yes how long have you been
105:18 - coding I think like five years I don't
105:25 - know every time I get asked this after
105:27 - think about it
105:28 - I just need to write it down and just
105:30 - stick it you know on my desk let me try
105:35 - to think so I've been at this position
105:36 - as a front-end developer for a little
105:39 - over two years before that yeah before
105:42 - that I think it was about three years
105:43 - that I was doing some website related
105:47 - stuff so I wasn't really doing like
105:51 - advanced coding stuff the whole time
105:54 - when I started out it was you know kind
105:57 - of maybe just customizing some WordPress
105:59 - themes just really minimal CSS work you
106:03 - know minimal HTML almost no JavaScript
106:06 - and then I started to get more into it
106:10 - so I started a lot better with CSS and
106:13 - then started getting in JavaScript and
106:16 - now obviously you all see what I do I've
106:20 - been you know I've been streaming all
106:22 - summer so you know I think you have a
106:25 - good idea of where I'm at now so but
106:28 - basically it's been like a five-year
106:29 - span of but I would say three years I've
106:34 - been like really trying to learn
106:35 - JavaScript as much as I could you know I
106:38 - can't always do what I want because it
106:40 - depends on the projects that I have but
106:43 - three years really for the JavaScript
106:46 - but just in terms of like web design and
106:48 - development in general five I did do
106:52 - stuff here and there before that and as
106:55 - I mentioned earlier I have a video on my
106:57 - own channel and I think the title was
106:59 - how I became a front-end developer and I
107:01 - go into it more in terms of like the
107:03 - points in my life where I actually did
107:05 - do web development work because there
107:09 - were some other other points like in
107:11 - high school and college and stuff that I
107:13 - did some stuff with that
107:20 - okay Ali says code pen allows asset
107:23 - hosting if you use projects rather than
107:26 - pens okay cool
107:29 - is that a new feature did I just miss
107:32 - that before like I said I haven't used
107:34 - code pen in a while but that that's
107:36 - really cool and is that a paid feature
107:38 - or can you do that on the free version
107:41 - now anyway that'd be good to know so I
107:44 - said earlier that you can't host files
107:46 - on code pen but I was mistaken so I
107:49 - guess there is a way I'm not sure how to
107:51 - do it but I think there is a way so
107:53 - that's that's good that's really awesome
107:55 - I see a lot of people doing the early
107:57 - free code camp lessons when they're
107:58 - first going into code pen aren't sure
108:01 - how to get images in there sometimes I
108:04 - see questions about that so okay Ali
108:10 - says you get one free project okay so
108:12 - you can do one one free project and
108:14 - actually host files there and then I
108:19 - guess if I don't know how much it costs
108:21 - but you could you know get the pro
108:23 - version and have more okay I see several
108:30 - people were saying that my kids are cute
108:32 - thank you
108:33 - yeah I think I did an alright job on on
108:36 - the kids so far none of them are I
108:40 - haven't messed any of them up yet
108:43 - hopefully I don't my oldest is only
108:46 - eight so I have a while to go okay
108:52 - nobody said I didn't know you had
108:53 - children I actually have four children
108:55 - so you saw my oldest too
108:57 - so Raphael Gemma and then I've Ambrose
109:02 - who's three and Cordelia who's about to
109:05 - turn one in a few weeks she'll turn one
109:09 - on October 5th so yeah so I'm busy
109:17 - alright I've gotten to the bottom of the
109:21 - live chat so I'll be back tomorrow
109:28 - and hopefully I'll have this to the
109:31 - point where we're not getting errors and
109:34 - we can actually start to work on things
109:36 - a little bit more alright so huh
109:42 - nope you just said I am shocked you
109:45 - shocked that I have four kids okay now
109:54 - I'm getting a few more things in the
109:56 - last here's Ali says that's impressive
110:01 - how often you stream and have four kids
110:03 - me actually so me being able to stream
110:06 - this much is really due to my boss
110:09 - letting me stream at work which is
110:12 - really awesome and he's a smart guy and
110:15 - he so he realized right away that me
110:20 - streaming would would not only be good
110:22 - for me and good for you know hopefully
110:25 - good for you all if you know you can
110:27 - learn learn about what I do or at least
110:29 - learn from my mistakes
110:30 - and but it would also be free publicity
110:34 - for the University so just to put it in
110:36 - perspective I think the university's
110:38 - YouTube account has maybe 20,000
110:40 - subscribers free code camp has over
110:43 - 200,000 subscribers so it's it's a
110:50 - little bit of like you know hey this
110:53 - will be good for university but also and
110:55 - this was unexpected at first I've gotten
110:58 - so much help on my projects by pool
111:01 - requests and by you all you know helping
111:03 - that it's really been a huge benefit to
111:06 - to the University you know to my
111:09 - department and in all our projects so I
111:13 - hope that he continues to let me do this
111:16 - and so far everybody's excited I I
111:19 - mentioned you you all in meetings
111:22 - frequently and sometimes even by name
111:25 - and I'll say you know hey so-and-so
111:27 - submitted a pull request and it was
111:29 - awesome or you know and everybody's
111:32 - really excited about that so your your
111:35 - you don't get to interact with other
111:37 - people here at the department but they
111:40 - know that you're there and that
111:41 - help and they're all happy and excited
111:43 - about it so anyway so I hope I can keep
111:45 - doing this if it ever happened that it
111:47 - wasn't allowed to do this at work
111:48 - anymore then I probably wouldn't be able
111:51 - to stream this frequently I just have to
111:54 - see it at that point I would I wouldn't
111:56 - want to stop streaming but you know it
111:59 - would be different the schedule would be
112:00 - different the projects would be
112:01 - different but hopefully that won't
112:02 - happen and I'll keep I'll keep doing
112:04 - this but yeah so that's how I can stream
112:08 - with four kids
112:13 - let's see us Sarat says can I be as good
112:18 - as you in two months with six hours of
112:20 - coding a day with consistency I may be I
112:24 - mean it just it depends on how fast of a
112:28 - learner you are what your background is
112:30 - already like what level you're out in
112:32 - terms of your skills with coding I so I
112:38 - don't know there's going to be it in
112:43 - terms of like just coding you can
112:46 - definitely get so like if you wanted to
112:48 - focus on just react and build react
112:50 - stuff you could definitely get there but
112:52 - there's gonna be like a broad area that
112:54 - you just can't get without time and that
112:57 - there's certain things like having
113:01 - persevered through like projects that
113:03 - are really hard or dealt with clients
113:05 - that are really difficult or like
113:08 - there's so many things that you can't
113:12 - just do it you know it just it's
113:14 - something that happens to you and it it
113:17 - makes you better it changes the way you
113:19 - look at things so things like that you
113:22 - obviously can't get by just training
113:24 - hard for you know for a couple of months
113:26 - but like as I was trying to say a few
113:30 - seconds ago like if you wanted to focus
113:32 - on a specific area you could definitely
113:34 - get as good or better than me quickly
113:37 - you know my five years of coding has
113:41 - been spread out over so many different
113:42 - things like I did a lot of search engine
113:45 - optimization work copywriting and a lot
113:51 - of WordPress stuff I was trying to learn
113:54 - angular at one
113:55 - time it's just been spread out over so
114:01 - many areas that I definitely think it's
114:04 - possible to get really good better than
114:07 - me at one particular area if you were to
114:09 - focus on that whereas I never really was
114:11 - able to focus until I started working
114:13 - here and really narrow down like this is
114:16 - going to be our stack this is what we're
114:18 - going to use and being able to commit to
114:20 - it which right now it's basically
114:22 - committing to reiax you know when you
114:26 - commit it's tough because you're
114:27 - basically saying no to everything else
114:29 - but by doing that it allows me to focus
114:32 - and get better it allows the people
114:34 - around me that are going to work with me
114:35 - to be able to know and for me to be
114:38 - predictable in my work so anyway so yeah
114:44 - it's entirely possible but I would say
114:46 - it's only possible in the sense that you
114:48 - would have to concentrate on one area
114:50 - and and there are some experiences you
114:55 - just can't recreate so how much that
114:59 - contributes to me being a better coder
115:00 - or not I don't know but I mean I'll tell
115:02 - you this like when you bring down
115:04 - somebody a business's email system for
115:08 - three days you definitely never ever
115:11 - mess with MX records again without
115:14 - copying them down first so like there
115:17 - are things like that that just like see
115:20 - her into your mind like something that
115:22 - needs to be done and yes I did do that
115:24 - before so it was it was a business in a
115:29 - big city in the United States that made
115:32 - a lot of money and I have no idea how
115:34 - much money that I actually cost them but
115:37 - I I did pay for them to hire somebody
115:41 - else to fix it so and that other person
115:46 - made a lot more per hour than I did so
115:48 - that but I think I got off easy on that
115:51 - because I still worked with that client
115:54 - for a long time after that it's actually
115:57 - one of my best clients so anyway so let
116:03 - me see I don't think there's any other
116:06 - okay one more
116:07 - course keep you in more questions hey
116:10 - it's fine
116:14 - [Music]
116:17 - okay so Hodor says quick question can
116:21 - link your coding environment which
116:23 - extensions are you using on on paceman I
116:27 - think there's a command to get a list of
116:29 - extensions okay yeah I'll have to there
116:32 - there is a way to get a list of
116:33 - extensions I'll probably get you the
116:35 - atom extensions because I haven't really
116:37 - loaded anything on Visual Studio code so
116:40 - that wouldn't be a useful list but I'll
116:43 - have to get my list of atom extensions
116:46 - and I'll put them I'll probably make a
116:49 - gist and have it in in github
116:53 - you know linked up to my profile so I'll
116:57 - have to remember to do that I'm I don't
116:59 - know if I'll get it done you know this
117:01 - week but it'll be on my list of stuff
117:03 - and I'll make sure I say something on
117:07 - the live stream about it no BS is what
117:09 - time in your country here 156 a.m. no
117:17 - beer are you in India or close to India
117:19 - because I'm pretty sure that's the time
117:22 - zone there it is four o'clock here yeah
117:28 - it's a 358 p.m. where I'm at I'm in
117:32 - Eastern Standard Time so there's the
117:35 - same time zone as New York and the east
117:37 - coast of the United States oh cool no
117:44 - beer is in Bangladesh so yeah I've had
117:48 - enough viewers from India that I I
117:51 - always remember what time it is in India
117:55 - and when I tell people like they look at
117:58 - me really weird like why would you know
118:00 - what time it is in India so I think it's
118:02 - cool it's cool to know that let's see
118:07 - okay zanny says why are you using
118:10 - classic ASP because I'm forced to that's
118:15 - so this is it's a pre-existing site that
118:20 - that
118:20 - kind of old and I just have to make the
118:23 - best of it so I'm just gonna try to
118:27 - clean it up make it faster make it more
118:29 - user-friendly and so I can't there's
118:33 - some things that I can't change on it
118:35 - and there's a lot of things that just
118:36 - aren't really worth it to dig into
118:38 - because this site won't last much longer
118:40 - if I'm not working on a new site
118:42 - sometime within the next year I will be
118:45 - very surprised because I've been I've
118:48 - been planning it like since before I
118:51 - even got the job here I remember before
118:53 - the interview I did a huge report on all
118:56 - the things that would change on this
118:58 - site and I turned that in on my in my
119:01 - interview to the person who's now my
119:03 - boss and yes and I actually I went
119:10 - through I think I even had code samples
119:11 - of like code that they could use to
119:14 - change the site right now so I think
119:19 - that that helped me get the job they
119:21 - were they like that but I'm ready it's
119:26 - been like over two years that I wanted
119:28 - to change the site so I don't want to
119:30 - wait another year so anyway that's why
119:32 - I'm stuck with with the classic ASP and
119:35 - I'm not really interested in trying to
119:37 - figure out how to change it
119:40 - so it is it is what it is right now but
119:43 - we're gonna make the best of it and and
119:45 - try to make this site I want to try to
119:47 - shock people that are used to this site
119:50 - with the new thing I want them to think
119:53 - that I completely redid the site but in
119:55 - fact we just are gonna change a few
119:57 - things you know to make it better so but
120:03 - I really enjoy doing things that other
120:04 - people think you can't be done right so
120:08 - I mean I know you all realized that
120:10 - these things are possible but a lot of
120:11 - people who aren't really into web
120:13 - development sometimes just they just
120:15 - assume that things can't be done because
120:17 - they may have been told by at some point
120:19 - by a developer like all we can't do that
120:21 - and who knows why that developer said
120:24 - that maybe they just meant you don't
120:26 - have the money for me to do that or
120:27 - I don't have the time or maybe they
120:29 - didn't have the skills to do it or
120:31 - didn't want to do it who knows but it's
120:33 - happened frequently at the University
120:34 - here that people have said I'll say well
120:36 - why don't we do this and I say all I
120:38 - know we can and sometimes it's literally
120:41 - as easy as 10 minutes in dev tools and
120:44 - you can find a fix those moments are
120:47 - really awesome when I get to see
120:49 - somebody sits like I wanted to do this
120:51 - for years and you just did it in 10
120:52 - minutes like those are really cool those
120:56 - are the moments that I like I write down
120:57 - or I usually don't write it down I put a
121:00 - note and Google keep just so I remember
121:01 - and then on bad days I can look at that
121:03 - and say like oh I did do something
121:05 - awesome but anyway I'm to the bottom of
121:10 - the live chat for real this time so I am
121:14 - gonna go now unless somebody sneaks a
121:17 - question in there before I can be
121:19 - finished but thanks again for watching
121:23 - thanks for all your help and for all the
121:27 - all the questions you all have great
121:28 - questions today and I know I talked for
121:31 - a little while on the question so sorry
121:35 - sorry if I talk too much
121:37 - I know occasionally I'll have people in
121:38 - the comments or in the live chat telling
121:40 - me I talk too much but it's not it's not
121:43 - a tutorial stream you know it's it's I
121:46 - like this question answer thing and I
121:48 - think it's it it makes this stream more
121:50 - unique if it was just me trying to teach
121:52 - you how to code it would not be a great
121:53 - stream because there's so much I still
121:56 - need to learn but my personal experience
122:00 - is unique to me and you can't get that
122:01 - anywhere else so if I share that then
122:04 - there might be some value here all right
122:07 - so I'm going to go now I'll be back
122:14 - tomorrow thank you so much for watching
122:17 - and have a great day
