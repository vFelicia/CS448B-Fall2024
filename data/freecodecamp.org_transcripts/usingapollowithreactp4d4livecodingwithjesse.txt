00:11 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:14 - with Jessie and today we're going to
00:18 - continue on with what we're doing
00:20 - yesterday with graph QL and WordPress
00:23 - and react but I got a pull request from
00:28 - Harshit so we're gonna go over that so
00:31 - we have I have on a on a separate branch
00:36 - right now that pull request and I
00:41 - haven't merged it yet partly because
00:42 - I've been working on other things and I
00:45 - didn't really have time to but I did
00:46 - have time to start to go through this
00:49 - pull request a bit and it looks great
00:55 - I'm just trying to get my head around
00:57 - what's going on because I've never
00:58 - worked with this before so just to sum
01:02 - up the pull request what he's done is
01:05 - he's taken out Redux and instead we're
01:11 - just using Apollo to work with our with
01:17 - graph QL and it's interesting
01:23 - I'll show you so we have some new dev
01:28 - tools stuff going on here with our
01:30 - Apollo tools but if we go back to our
01:33 - Redux you can see we actually have the
01:38 - state showing up here like it would
01:40 - normally so in the description for the
01:44 - pool request this is pull request one in
01:46 - the github repo that's linked in the
01:48 - description if you want to check out
01:49 - what was changed but Harshit mentions
01:54 - that there is basically redux is being
02:03 - used by apollo anyway behind the scenes
02:06 - so that makes sense so I want to check
02:11 - this out and I want to get a
02:13 - opinion on you know whether or not is
02:19 - this is this the best route to go just
02:22 - to completely cut out Redux and work
02:26 - with Apollo and because I I don't know
02:29 - because I haven't worked with it before
02:30 - and let me lay out before before we do
02:34 - our first session and basically the
02:36 - first session is going to be going
02:38 - through some of this code before we even
02:39 - start to code anything else just so that
02:41 - we're all on the same page but what I'm
02:47 - thinking is would there be some reason
02:52 - down the road that we would want to use
02:55 - redux as well and if that's the case
03:00 - should we try to incorporate redux right
03:04 - off the bat or should we wait and if we
03:06 - need it then bring it in so that's kind
03:10 - of what I'm thinking about right now
03:13 - so I'll give everyone a chance to you
03:16 - know think about that if you've if
03:19 - you've worked with with redux and Apollo
03:22 - before just let me know or if it's
03:25 - better just to go with Apollo and and if
03:27 - we can accomplish the same things with
03:29 - Apollo that we could with redux then I
03:32 - just need to learn how to do it like
03:35 - that then okay cool all right Harsha
03:39 - says it's not that complex of an app
03:41 - you're right yeah it's not really
03:42 - complex I think I mentioned yesterday
03:44 - it'd be I'd like to add a little bit
03:47 - more complexity to it but for now it is
03:50 - and really we're just getting data about
03:52 - posts from WordPress and we're
03:55 - displaying those posts and then
03:57 - everything else is really just we want
04:01 - to allow users to search for posts and
04:03 - we want them to be able to filter posts
04:05 - based on categories based on date and
04:08 - then beyond that we just want to display
04:11 - those posts in different ways which
04:13 - really doesn't have much to do with with
04:16 - our store or where the data is that's
04:18 - more of just make creating different
04:23 - views and putting that same data into
04:26 - the views
04:26 - different ways okay all right let's let
04:34 - me bring over my my timer or is it that
04:38 - all right let's bring over my timer I'm
04:42 - gonna start this Pomodoro timer so we'll
04:44 - do 25 minutes of coding or at least code
04:47 - review and then I'm going to take a
04:49 - five-minute break answer any questions
04:52 - that are in the live chat and then we'll
04:53 - come back and do another 25 minute
04:55 - session we'll probably just do two
04:57 - Pomodoro sessions of coding today we'll
05:01 - see how it goes but we'll do at least
05:04 - two and let's see it looks like my
05:13 - analytics may be off occasionally
05:14 - they're off at the very beginning of
05:16 - this dream but it looks like we have a
05:18 - lot fewer people than we normally do so
05:22 - let me know did you all get a
05:25 - notification occasionally if I if I
05:29 - don't schedule the stream until later in
05:31 - the day sometimes the notifications
05:34 - don't go out normally it looks like I
05:36 - got one on my phone but anyway I still
05:41 - have to do work whether or not anybody's
05:42 - watching so we're definitely gonna
05:43 - continue okay cool Kevin's here hey
05:47 - Kevin and Kevin did get a notification
05:49 - so alright okay awesome so I see some
05:57 - more people in here now yeah my
05:59 - analytics are definitely off because
06:01 - there are more people talking in the
06:03 - live chat hadn't been registering on the
06:07 - the YouTube analytics so I'm not gonna
06:10 - stress this for now I do want to
06:13 - remember to start my and Rock server so
06:16 - I'm going to do that right now and I'll
06:20 - copy the link in so in the live chat
06:26 - there's now a link you can click that
06:30 - and then you can see in real time all
06:32 - the changes that we're making you can
06:34 - inspect it in dev tools and
06:39 - it'll be a lot easier to kind of see
06:42 - what's going on all right so let's go
06:46 - through some of some of the code if you
06:51 - want to look at it more on your own like
06:54 - I mentioned earlier check out who
06:56 - requests one in the github repo that's
06:59 - linked in the description and then
07:00 - you'll be able to see the explanation
07:03 - and exactly what was changed but I'm
07:06 - going to go through some things let's
07:10 - see let's get rid of I'm gonna get rid
07:12 - of some of the stuff that is not there
07:16 - anymore it's not needed I think this one
07:19 - also is not needed so big the big thing
07:25 - to notice right off the bat is we have
07:27 - no more actions or reducers okay so if
07:30 - we're not using redux we don't need any
07:31 - of that Redux stuff so that's all gone
07:35 - we also don't need this
07:38 - this API utility okay so that's gone as
07:44 - well you'll notice that the components
07:49 - are all much smaller and let's go back -
07:55 - here we go alright so we do have a few
07:59 - things and I guess I'll start with this
08:03 - one because it's up here not sure if
08:04 - it's the best order but so we have a
08:07 - graph QL folder now and within that we
08:10 - have mutations which there's nothing in
08:13 - this file yet but under our queries
08:17 - under posts you can see just like
08:21 - yesterday whenever we we put in a query
08:25 - structure - just like this well I don't
08:28 - think we had the featured image in there
08:29 - but basically we structured I like this
08:30 - to get the data back so now we have two
08:33 - queries that are built out here so
08:37 - single post query to get a particular
08:43 - post so we're passing in an ID here and
08:47 - then we get all posts here so we're just
08:50 - asking you know for all the posts
08:52 - I mean this is so far I haven't used
08:58 - graph QL very much at all but I'm liking
09:02 - this you can look at this and
09:04 - immediately know all right I know
09:07 - exactly what data I'm gonna get back
09:09 - that's cool it's not always so apparent
09:12 - with the REST API
09:15 - you know the WordPress REST API I could
09:19 - look at the URL that I'm putting in and
09:22 - know that I'm getting posts but I
09:24 - wouldn't necessarily know you know all
09:27 - the other stuff that I'm getting unless
09:28 - I'm already familiar with what I get
09:30 - back from that API so I really like that
09:32 - it makes it you know easy to know
09:34 - immediately what's going on and let's go
09:38 - here we have our Apollo client so where
09:42 - as yesterday we had a lot of this stuff
09:44 - in our app dot J's file now we just
09:51 - import all of that in so it cleans up
09:54 - the Abkhaz file a bit we imported in
09:57 - we're still we're bringing this in in
10:00 - the same way but we no longer are
10:02 - passing in the store so other than that
10:08 - I mean well with the exception of
10:10 - removing all the stuff that pertain to
10:11 - Redux it's pretty much the pretty much
10:14 - the same here so now let's actually
10:16 - check out our home component where we're
10:20 - displaying some of this stuff so if you
10:22 - notice on the on the site I'm not sure
10:28 - where the site said I had it up I'll
10:34 - have to oh it's a funny I way too many
10:37 - things open on my other screen here all
10:43 - right here we go so the site now it's
10:47 - actually it's pulling data from
10:48 - somewhere else not from from my web site
10:50 - so that's why it's all different but you
10:53 - can see for this home page it's just
10:57 - displaying all the posts right so it's
11:00 - using that first query that gets all the
11:02 - posts and then if we click inside it
11:05 - then it takes us to a single post page a
11:08 - post detail page that uses that second
11:11 - query that passes actually passes the ID
11:15 - which we can see the post ID here and
11:18 - gets the information all right so that's
11:23 - what's going on
11:24 - in terms of how it how it looks and
11:26 - here's the code for that
11:38 - okay that's interesting I didn't notice
11:41 - it like I said I didn't really have a
11:42 - chance to go through everything in here
11:44 - current user okay so it looks like this
11:50 - is in here for when we implement the
11:53 - login system so probably correct me if
11:56 - I'm wrong
11:56 - Harshit but this is probably not doing
12:00 - much of anything right now since we
12:02 - don't have a login system hooked up this
12:10 - is not the good
12:18 - wait harsh it says this isn't the code
12:21 - okay you know what maybe he's still
12:24 - displaying the the code the previous
12:26 - code let me reopen that there we go
12:39 - that's it okay cool yeah that that
12:43 - looked a little odd I guess I had put
12:44 - that in there yesterday and didn't
12:46 - remember that I did it okay I think that
12:50 - was the example I copied and pasted from
12:52 - somewhere okay thanks for letting me
12:55 - know about that
12:58 - okay so here's what's going on now so
13:03 - we're bringing in graph QL and this from
13:12 - what I understand and just the
13:15 - disclaimer here I'm seeing a lot of this
13:18 - for the first time so this is definitely
13:20 - going to be a learning episode for this
13:24 - stream here but from from what it looks
13:29 - like is we're bringing in graph QL here
13:34 - and we're calling that query get all
13:39 - posts and then what I'm assuming happens
13:42 - because otherwise I I don't know how the
13:45 - data would be displayed is that when we
13:46 - do that those posts end up getting into
13:53 - here's props
13:54 - so this props data and then under posts
13:57 - we'll have all our posts so correct me
14:02 - if I'm wrong but I I mean that just
14:04 - doesn't seem like obviously it has to be
14:08 - getting into props somehow so I think
14:10 - that's it so we can determine what query
14:14 - we want so I think I close that window
14:18 - out but if you remember we had our
14:20 - queries so get all posts that's that's
14:27 - what we're using down here
14:29 - and cool I like that so added a little
14:35 - loading thing so if there are no posts
14:37 - we're loading if there are posts then we
14:40 - actually display the posts I like that
14:42 - that's nice you can see really clean
14:45 - definitely clean things up a lot so I I
14:48 - like this so I still need to learn more
14:51 - you know to to work with it myself but I
14:55 - do really like this the other one that
14:58 - will have some code with them let me
15:01 - okay and we're bringing in that query
15:02 - and okay so we're using the constructor
15:08 - bind okay we're doing the loading thing
15:14 - up here like this alright so down here
15:18 - we're doing a single post detail but
15:20 - then options match okay so we're
15:29 - grabbing the ID from our match params
15:36 - we're passing in like that okay
15:43 - I'm gonna check out the the other file
15:49 - here I want to check these out side by
15:51 - side why did that not work
16:04 - all right so something's up with with
16:07 - Adam from so I guess I'm not gonna do
16:10 - this side by side right now
16:27 - all right that's that's interesting to
16:29 - me that that it gets passed in like this
16:34 - I would have thought that we would have
16:37 - passed it in more like a regular
16:39 - function but instead it's like the
16:44 - second argument of this graph QL hmm all
16:55 - right so that's something I'll have to
16:57 - I'll have to look up more but basically
17:01 - I mean that's that's it that's pretty
17:06 - much all that was added to be able to
17:08 - get everything to display like you know
17:10 - like you can see on the site if you go
17:13 - to the the link posted earlier so let's
17:21 - forget to start my timer so I'm just
17:25 - gonna keep an eye on the time for now
17:27 - and then I'll start the timer for the
17:31 - next one let's see
17:42 - all right she's checking the live chat
17:44 - briefly okay all right so I guess what
17:53 - what I'd like to do now then is try to
17:59 - hook this up with as much as cool as all
18:02 - this these comic books are I would like
18:06 - to hook this up with the data that we
18:10 - are working with yesterday and also at
18:15 - some point we need to we need to hook
18:20 - ups either a custom post type or if we
18:22 - can stick with posts we need to have
18:24 - some custom fields for the posts so
18:29 - we're gonna work on that I don't know if
18:31 - we'll get into that today but let's get
18:38 - some data in there some of the other
18:40 - data in there and I don't know I mean I
18:47 - guess if if I can wrap my head around
18:49 - how things are working and there's
18:51 - really no reason why we couldn't start
18:53 - to actually build this out a little bit
18:55 - more with with a UI that's closer to
18:59 - what it's actually gonna be like so so
19:05 - let's start on that I need to grab let's
19:08 - see I believe that or Apollo client is
19:15 - where we can put this in yep that's it
19:17 - so there you go Jessie why google.com
19:23 - slash graph QL and let's see what we get
19:31 - so far I just get a lot of loading
19:33 - loading all right so do nothing so far
19:39 - let's let's see what's going on whoa
19:44 - fail to fetch that's interesting
20:00 - hmm
20:04 - it's my site down I'm just going on
20:12 - I must say still working
20:17 - hmm
20:39 - okay for some reason this is not working
20:45 - that's good that's really good
21:00 - let me make sure this plugin is still
21:04 - active yeah okay yeah so I'm not really
21:14 - sure not sure what the problem is
21:17 - let's go let me do here let's find our
21:21 - queries you know opposed let's try to
21:24 - run this here okay yeah we're still not
21:28 - getting anything
21:39 - let's run this again interesting
21:52 - hmm
22:06 - okay maybe
22:18 - oops it's not what I wanted when it
22:20 - posed alright for those edges
22:33 - hmm
23:25 - interesting
23:28 - okay well we could just go back to using
23:33 - the other one for now and then I can
23:37 - look into what's going on that'll
23:44 - probably be the best thing to do for now
23:50 - so let me
23:58 - let me just go back let's go back to
24:05 - this
24:14 - and
24:22 - sorry
24:36 - yep
24:37 - okay so that is working
24:47 - let's try to get some categories as well
24:58 - some wonder you know pose
25:05 - let's try to make another query and
25:13 - let's say categories let's see what we
25:23 - need for category there we go categories
25:26 - I just know
25:40 - mmm
26:03 - you see
26:18 - maybe there are no categories in here so
26:21 - that's why I'm not getting categories
26:32 - hmm
26:42 - okay that's what hard she said no
26:44 - categories okay well um we are going to
26:48 - need categories at some point so we can
26:50 - grab this and at least make it who hard
26:57 - says otherwise I would have built that
26:58 - too for you thanks I appreciate that
27:02 - it's probably good that there's some
27:04 - stuff that I still need to build that
27:05 - way I'll learn I'll learn how to do it
27:08 - too so let's put that in so we have our
27:12 - posts jeaious
27:14 - so let's make a categories dodge ass and
27:20 - and then we could make I mean we won't
27:23 - really be able to test it out because
27:25 - there are no categories but once I
27:27 - figure out what's going on with the
27:31 - WordPress my wordpress site and why I
27:33 - can't get data from it
27:35 - then we can test it out with categories
27:37 - but if we use this as an example I'm
27:41 - sure it'll work when the time comes
27:43 - so let's inquiries let's make a new file
27:48 - we're going to call this categories and
28:04 - oops I wanted to see those let's just
28:13 - copy everything paste it in there and
28:18 - then we'll also get get this again and
28:27 - we'll paste it in instead of instead of
28:35 - this one
28:42 - get all categories and categories and I
28:53 - guess we can we can also get a single
28:55 - category I I don't know that we would
29:02 - need to I'm not gonna put that in now
29:04 - because I I can't really see a case
29:06 - where we would need to get a single
29:09 - category by ID so I'm going to leave it
29:13 - off for now
29:15 - and let's just export this really I want
29:25 - more than the ID let's at least try to
29:29 - get the slug and what else I guess I'm
29:37 - not sure if the it would be category
29:40 - name or if it would be category title
29:43 - because I haven't seen that data
29:56 - okay let me keep an eye all right so
30:01 - it's it is time for me to do a five
30:04 - minute break for question and answer so
30:06 - let me do that now and I'm going to
30:10 - scroll up to the top of the live chat
30:12 - here and just go down through see if
30:14 - there's any questions I can answer
30:25 - okay so Rolando would like to know of a
30:29 - simple tutorial to begin learning reacts
30:36 - so there are some good YouTube videos
30:39 - that are introductions to react learn
30:42 - code Academy is a YouTube channel that
30:45 - has some good in sure to react videos
30:48 - they are a few years old but the the
30:52 - general concepts of react are still the
30:54 - same even though maybe some of the
30:56 - syntax will be a little bit different
30:58 - you know in the current version also I
31:05 - think there are some react videos on the
31:08 - free code camp channel sorry it seems
31:17 - like this time of day I'm just I'm
31:19 - always yawning no matter what even if I
31:22 - get enough sleep or enough caffeine in
31:25 - this yawning yeah like what else else is
31:30 - good for reacts if you like kind of like
31:33 - the in-browser tutorial stuff code
31:36 - Academy has has yeah they have an
31:44 - in-browser tutorial I haven't checked it
31:46 - out for a while I did it when it first
31:48 - came out so they may have more than one
31:51 - out now so those are the ones that just
31:54 - come into my mind
32:06 - okay
32:15 - okay Marco asked how is this loading
32:18 - page being displayed and I think we I
32:21 - think I showed that could but let's
32:24 - we'll take a look at it again in case I
32:26 - didn't really explain it but you can see
32:29 - here is where the loading takes place so
32:31 - it's just simply checks to see if if
32:34 - they're posed so basically if if there
32:38 - aren't any posts yet in this props data
32:41 - posts then it's displays loading
32:46 - otherwise if posts exists then it
32:50 - displays everything so initially when
32:52 - everything loads there won't be post
32:54 - right because we still have to tell
32:56 - graph QL to use this query to get the
33:00 - data but then once the data comes in
33:02 - then it gets put into props then it will
33:07 - it will display so that's where the
33:10 - loading is coming in John lund said you
33:18 - sound a bit English Jessie I like I've
33:21 - never even been to England so I don't
33:23 - know but I actually really like to watch
33:26 - a few English youtubers that have
33:30 - cooking shows
33:31 - maybe it's rubbing off on me I don't
33:34 - know but I'm not now in English I would
33:40 - say if there's any influence on my my
33:43 - accent my pronunciation of words it
33:45 - would probably be a Pittsburgh influence
33:48 - because I live pretty near to Pittsburgh
33:59 - but I know if anybody has ever been to
34:02 - Pittsburgh you know they they have quite
34:04 - a few words that are very unique to
34:06 - Pittsburgh and I'm not I don't usually
34:09 - use the Pittsburgh slang terminology but
34:12 - I grew the people that live right across
34:14 - the street from me growing up were like
34:16 - they definitely had the Pittsburgh
34:18 - accent used all the Pittsburgh words so
34:21 - it could have rubbed off on see our Toro
34:28 - says asked you know you took all the
34:30 - Redux code up yeah so well I didn't
34:33 - harsh it did in his pool request and
34:35 - that's what we're checking out right now
34:36 - but yeah so it looks like we're not
34:38 - we're not gonna use Redux we don't
34:42 - really have to
34:50 - okay all right kevin says by the way
34:53 - that gql stuff is a tagged template
34:57 - string okay let's check that out because
35:02 - I did wonder about that all right Shh
35:04 - all right I'm not familiar with tagged
35:07 - template string so I may have to look
35:10 - that up interesting
35:21 - cool alright so my five minutes is up
35:24 - so I'll come back to the live chat and
35:27 - go through the rest of it after our next
35:29 - coding session but for right now let's
35:39 - go back so we should be save that and
35:46 - cool all right I just scrolled down to
35:48 - the bottom of the live chat now I'm just
35:50 - gonna mention the last two comments
35:52 - before I start the next session here
35:53 - because they're awesome so haha
35:56 - checkpoint says you guys are amazing and
35:59 - I appreciate that thanks for saying that
36:05 - and then Silas has finally caught your
36:08 - livestream so awesome really glad that
36:12 - you could catch the livestream it's
36:14 - awesome so I feel free to ask any
36:16 - questions or contribute in the live chat
36:20 - ok oh I did I do have to ask a question
36:26 - I told a friend of mine that I would ask
36:31 - if anyone knew of any good beginner
36:34 - resources or books on on a VBA so I
36:39 - guess they're gonna try to learn that so
36:42 - anyway let me know I don't know if
36:44 - anybody knows but I have no idea of any
36:46 - resources on it so he had he had asked
36:49 - me about it two days ago and I forgot to
36:53 - ask yesterday so if anybody knows let me
36:56 - know otherwise you don't worry about it
36:59 - I'm sure it'll be all right he's smart
37:01 - guy all right
37:09 - so at this point I don't really want to
37:12 - spend a lot of time troubleshooting my
37:14 - wordpress site I don't I don't really
37:17 - think that would be we're allowed to do
37:18 - at this point especially since I'm not
37:21 - at first I'm just gonna do a little bit
37:23 - of research so that's not really not
37:25 - good - like what somebody else Google I
37:28 - don't think that's that's very fun so
37:30 - let's do some some UI stuff which maybe
37:43 - we should bring in material UI so if
37:53 - you're not familiar with material you
37:55 - I'll bring it up so material - you i.com
38:03 - for our last project we used this
38:07 - version of material UI the old version
38:11 - and this is simply a framework of react
38:13 - components that follow the material
38:18 - design guidelines but I'm thinking
38:22 - yesterday I did some do some reading of
38:26 - the documentation of the newest version
38:29 - of material you I and I think I think we
38:35 - may use this they have some they have
38:41 - some good stuff in here so we're gonna
38:44 - try to use this I know last time we
38:45 - tried to use this that it just came out
38:47 - and it didn't really go so well but I
38:48 - think at this point there should be
38:50 - enough information out there that I can
38:54 - that I can get at or actually let me see
38:58 - okay harsh you're just putting a live
39:00 - chat you need to downgrade WP graph QL
39:03 - okay is that gonna fix the issues that
39:07 - we're having okay I wish looked up a
39:14 - little bit farther
39:17 - oh okay so it looks like there's some
39:22 - sort of breaking change all right what's
39:24 - worth a shot to check this out
39:26 - WP graph QL github see they have a
39:34 - change
39:50 - okay
40:21 - all right this looks like maybe this is
40:23 - our problem I request an Authenticator
40:28 - for three session
40:53 - hmm
40:57 - okay releases all right so miss that
41:05 - okay
41:54 - it's just thing okay
42:02 - I forgot to start it again better set my
42:05 - timer let me start the timer for 25
42:07 - minutes all right so I'm actually I'm
42:11 - not going to reset or go back to a
42:17 - previous version right now there's
42:21 - basically I'd like to stick with the
42:23 - most current version and then just do
42:27 - whatever I need to do to my WordPress
42:28 - installation to make this work obviously
42:30 - there's something you can do to make it
42:32 - work because it's working with you know
42:36 - the demo WordPress installation so I
42:40 - think I'd rather do that and be able to
42:43 - stick with the newest version but this
42:51 - may point me in the right direction to
42:53 - see what I need to do but for now let's
43:01 - let's bring this in thank you
43:10 - Kevin just reminded me that my face was
43:12 - covering the timer again thanks for that
43:15 - I'll get used to that eventually
43:18 - I just extremes
43:22 - without my face being there for so long
43:24 - now I just can't can't seem to remember
43:27 - this there I hope I don't make any weird
43:29 - faces because I forget that you all can
43:32 - see me so let me know if I'm doing
43:36 - something strange okay
43:49 - haha oh man okay so this is the problem
43:54 - so Harshit says the demo uses the older
43:57 - version that's why it works
43:59 - haha okay that makes so much sense now
44:10 - all right we know what I'm gonna do
44:12 - actually at some point in the maybe I
44:18 - might not get to it today but hopefully
44:20 - you know before the next stream on
44:22 - Monday I'm gonna reach out to the
44:25 - creator of this plugin so the the person
44:28 - who created this plug-in got a hold of
44:31 - me on Twitter yesterday afternoon and
44:36 - actually gave me access to the slack
44:39 - channel for this for this plug-in and
44:45 - offered to to talk to me and even
44:49 - potentially talk on the stream and
44:51 - explain more about the plug-in and how
44:53 - to use it so I'll reach out to him and
44:59 - it's his name's Jason ball so I'll reach
45:03 - out to Jason and just kind of ask him
45:06 - what's up with the new version and and
45:07 - how do I get it working and then and
45:12 - we'll get that all sorted up and I also
45:19 - think I'm gonna submit a pull request to
45:21 - update the documentation a little bit
45:23 - because I we had a little bit of trouble
45:26 - in trying to get that to work yesterday
45:28 - I don't think the documentation needs a
45:30 - lot of work in terms of my documentation
45:34 - I mean the stuff that they have in the
45:36 - readme on github the actual
45:38 - documentation you click you can click
45:40 - through to get to their site on is it's
45:43 - not bad but some of the stuff in the
45:45 - video I think would be good to have in
45:48 - the in the readme in the github repo
45:51 - okay
45:55 - so let's do that so anyway thanks are
45:58 -  for for all the info as well it's
46:00 - like saving me so much time of
46:03 - troubleshooting so let's bring in I
46:08 - gotta go to my terminal first should we
46:20 - merge this now or should we just keep
46:22 - words so I made another branch called
46:24 - Note redux I guess I don't have to merge
46:31 - it right now during the stream but I'm
46:33 - just thinking are we 100% sure you know
46:38 - we want to go with this and we won't
46:39 - want to go back to what we had before
46:41 - I'm pretty sure that we want to go with
46:43 - this but I'll hold off and merge it
46:47 - later for now I guess we can install
47:02 - this as well
47:57 - that's interesting
48:01 - I don't think I've ever brought in a
48:04 - Google font with NPM I'd like to try it
48:12 - though
48:28 - okay so we're going to try to bring this
48:29 - in and then we can just import this into
48:32 - our route component and then I I suppose
48:35 - we'll be able to use it so that's seems
48:43 - convenient give it a shot
48:45 - okay and where's our app touch yes we'll
48:49 - bring it in here
48:59 - okay
49:18 - all right so let's we'll just put in
49:22 - just very basic stuff how to get started
49:25 - so just make sure yeah that's it that's
49:31 - all for installation and
49:53 - interesting so they have a create react
49:58 - app example
50:07 - okay so nothing there
50:13 - to death
50:28 - hmm
50:45 - it's interesting this is definitely
50:47 - different than than the other version
50:50 - that we had used all right so let's just
50:55 - bring in let's bring you some components
50:58 - that we know we'll need so we'll
50:59 - definitely need that top at bar
51:04 - here we go so let's bring that in to get
51:10 - nuts
51:28 - okay yeah so this is what we'll want and
51:41 - Wow quite a bit okay
52:08 - all right let's bring that into we don't
52:11 - want to nap Jess let's put it in home I
52:14 - eventually at some point we'll probably
52:16 - have a layout component so we don't have
52:18 - to bring this in all the time or you
52:20 - know but for now I don't mind doing it
52:24 - like this just to make it make it easy
52:28 - to adjust until we get it to a point
52:29 - where you know we really like how it
52:31 - looks so let me listen for now okay I
52:42 - thought I had pasted that copy something
52:44 - different let me bring this in now let's
52:49 - see there
52:59 - let's see if we won okay yeah let's
53:03 - bring these in first
53:17 - all right so hopefully our app will look
53:23 - a little bit more exciting here in a
53:25 - minute thanks let's do that a bit
53:44 - I'd say that and see if we get errors
53:49 - yeah classes is not defined that when
53:52 - you find
53:54 - oops and pace practice
54:21 - all right let's see if we get it now
54:41 - all right so we're getting some errors
54:43 - and you can see if you if you've clicked
54:47 - on the the n grok length in them you
54:50 - could probably see these as well we'll
54:53 - just go through some of these errors 935
55:02 - all right so we're getting miss there we
55:08 - go that's what I missed
55:09 - I'm sure somebody in the lab had already
55:11 - caught that
55:27 - how about I just
55:36 - hooves
56:01 - so this is not to find where we
56:12 - what did I just do I took out the wrong
56:15 - thing button app bar is not this
56:27 - I'll put it I put it in the right spot
56:42 - oh you know what I didn't did I yeah
57:09 - see if we Stuart
57:19 - no we do in fact need that let me check
57:22 - the hi chefs
57:25 - oh did I not bring in I think I need to
57:36 - bring in prop types I'm pretty sure we
57:38 - don't
57:51 - right didn't prop types you used to be a
57:54 - part of react and then now now you
57:58 - actually have to bring them in correct
58:29 - okay
58:31 - let's give this another shot
58:48 - hmm
58:58 - wait a second huh oh my goodness all
59:04 - right I feel really silly right now
59:06 - obviously because the components name is
59:09 - button a part and this okay all right oh
59:22 - my goodness
59:27 - so we don't even really need that but
59:29 - just to get it to work let's what you
59:35 - know you're happy
59:56 - yes
60:16 - I'm pretty sure we got pretty much
60:20 - everything from this
60:38 - all right how are we going to do this
60:48 - all right
60:53 - okay question alright so it seems like
60:58 - I've missed this here at the bottom we
61:02 - have to do you know we have to say which
61:05 - style styles and then button at bar but
61:08 - how do we combine that with what we're
61:10 - doing here
61:34 - I seriously doubt
61:42 - see
61:50 - I thought we could just put them
61:51 - side-by-side I mean I guess it's worth a
61:58 - shot
61:59 - we're already getting there there's no
62:04 - way that's gonna work let's see what we
62:06 - get
62:07 - yeah it's not gonna work I'm gonna make
62:09 - this work
62:19 - you didn't wrap it with him Eli provided
62:28 - that let's see
62:36 - yeah I don't think we needed to I mean
62:41 - let me check this example again see what
62:47 - they did here yeah so they've wrapped
62:52 - they didn't wrap the root component in
62:54 - anything there you can check our pages
62:58 - shoot they did here
63:08 - see if he did
63:27 - who
64:12 - I could try to do it sir alright so hard
64:16 -  put in the in the live chat try it
64:19 - like this
64:20 - but I've we're still not we still don't
64:23 - have styles in there let's see what
64:27 - happens
64:30 - hmm
64:34 - okay so when we do it like that we're
64:37 - not getting the the post spec I don't
64:48 - know I'm thinking about just going back
64:50 - to the old material you are again let's
64:58 - see
65:13 - see what they're doing for the
65:14 - components
65:30 - Oh
65:33 - so this is where they're wrapping the
65:35 - the theme and everything
65:46 - the
65:49 - all right I definitely don't have enough
65:52 - time in this pumping or a session to
65:54 - deal with this okay hmm
66:07 - okay I still have to look into that let
66:11 - me know what you think though because
66:12 - I'm about to do a question and answers
66:15 - is it worth it to try to do the latest
66:19 - version of material UI or should I just
66:22 - go back to the old version that we've
66:24 - used before potentially just waiting
66:28 - until it's not in beta anymore and then
66:35 - using it let's see then I go back I try
66:45 - to get back to see what version run
66:52 - yeah we're it's still in beta okay
66:57 - anyway let me know about that so I'm
67:00 - gonna switch over to the question and
67:02 - answer session
67:03 - so yes so if you can stick around for
67:10 - your question answer session and even if
67:12 - you don't have a question you can help
67:14 - answer questions that would be awesome
67:15 - would definitely value your opinion
67:18 - otherwise thanks for watching it was
67:23 - kind of a mixed bag today I had some
67:27 - cool stuff with with Apollo and getting
67:30 - things to work not I didn't really do
67:33 - much
67:34 - Harshit did most of the work and then
67:37 - completely failed and trying to get the
67:39 - new version of material material UI it's
67:45 - a work but hopefully hopefully it'll be
67:50 - better on Monday anyway let's get
67:54 - started I'm gonna scroll up and pick up
67:57 - where I left off answering questions
68:01 - alright okay so Brett says it's graph Q
68:06 - I'm making a second API call to get the
68:08 - featured image and that Kevin responded
68:15 - the featured image link is fetched in
68:18 - the single API request but the actual
68:21 - image is loaded in a different request
68:25 - started by the image tag okay that makes
68:33 - sense
68:34 - Brett says says my fetch calls only have
68:39 - the ID of the featured image in there
68:42 - the WordPress REST API and have to make
68:44 - another call to get the image URL yeah
68:47 - so yeah that is interesting so that's
68:51 - true in the with the REST API you don't
68:54 - actually get the image URL by default
68:56 - with the post so you can get a plug-in
68:59 - that will give you that data or you can
69:02 - make a second API calls since you will
69:04 - have the the image ID but let's see what
69:08 - we're getting yeah let's see what we're
69:14 - getting with that one call my queries
69:19 - you know it's not working because of
69:22 - error let's go back I'm just gonna take
69:32 - a lot of this out of here just so we can
69:34 - get something that works
69:46 - okay now let's see if we can get this so
69:51 - let's run this so this is the get all
69:53 - post query and we can see the data that
69:56 - we're getting back let's just get rid of
69:59 - this the day that we're getting back
70:02 - does have the source URL so probably
70:08 - what's happening is that the way that
70:10 - this plug-in is built to get the data
70:14 - from WordPress is it does actually give
70:18 - you the URL so it's a little a little
70:21 - different than the WordPress API which I
70:24 - mean this actually makes a lot of sense
70:26 - I I read some issues and the reasoning
70:29 - on why they didn't include the URL in
70:32 - the post but it I don't know it seems to
70:35 - me like the URL is so much more useful
70:38 - than the image ID like why wouldn't you
70:41 - want that included with you know the
70:43 - post request but anyway but that is
70:48 - there so you don't need a second API
70:52 - call
70:58 - so Marco says so basically when using
71:01 - graph QL with Redux and Apollo I can
71:03 - just remove Redux from my project it
71:07 - seems it seems like you could there
71:10 - potentially depending on how complex
71:12 - your project is there may be some
71:14 - reasons for using it I would think
71:20 - there's probably some things that you
71:22 - would want hmm sorry there's probably
71:30 - some things that you would want globally
71:32 - available in the store that you're not
71:35 - necessarily getting from graph QL in
71:38 - that case then I think you know maybe
71:42 - you would want to use Redux
71:44 - with with Apollo with graph QL unless
71:48 - there's some way using Apollo to add
71:51 - things to the store now they're
71:56 - necessarily being dated you know that
72:00 - you get from graphic UL I don't know yet
72:03 - I haven't got that far with it
72:29 - okay so we had a question earlier from
72:34 - Rolando about resources for learning
72:36 - react and Marco says traversée media is
72:41 - a great channel to learn react so I
72:43 - haven't seen anything from traversée
72:45 - media myself but I guess check it out
72:48 - Marco says they're good resource
73:06 - fairest Moss says why do you guys keep
73:09 - labeling these as with react shouldn't
73:11 - it be with webcam or something um any
73:16 - Kevin responds react is a JavaScript
73:19 - framework or library I'm with you there
73:22 - Kevin I always go back and forth on
73:24 - calling things frameworks and libraries
73:26 - but anyway reactors JavaScript framework
73:29 - created by Facebook to make web
73:30 - development easier
73:31 - jesse is using it in this project so and
73:34 - Ferris says okay thank you for
73:37 - clarifying that yeah I guess that's if
73:41 - you're not familiar with the names of
73:42 - the technologies that we're using the
73:44 - titles of these videos are probably Oh
73:45 - nonsense
73:47 - I mean you just can't explain everything
73:49 - in a title so sorry about that
74:06 - okay no beers here it says sorry I've
74:09 - been busy busy for last two weeks so
74:13 - that I can't watch your live session oh
74:15 - it's cool no beer don't worry about it I
74:18 - mean we definitely like to have you
74:19 - around for the live session but I
74:21 - totally understand if you can't be here
74:22 - I know I'm super busy all the time if I
74:27 - couldn't do these live sessions at work
74:29 - then there's no way I'd be able to do it
74:31 - for you know one to two hours every
74:35 - every weekday so totally understand
74:40 - about being busy let's see fastest on e
74:49 - says semicolon is missing no actually I
74:54 - don't use semicolons normally it looked
74:59 - weird for for a few minutes there
75:00 - because I was copy and pasting in code
75:03 - that was using semicolons so it it
75:06 - probably looked a mess but kevin says
75:11 - semicolons are never missing unless you
75:13 - miss them
75:14 - I like that Kevin s yeah so you don't
75:19 - really need semicolons I know there's
75:24 - some case and I know we've had it before
75:26 - in the live chat where it would might
75:31 - mess things up if you don't use a
75:32 - semicolon but I can't remember that
75:35 - cases offhand but I remember thinking
75:37 - wow I've never had that particular case
75:40 - come up for me so most of the time
75:43 - you're alright with leaving out
75:44 - semicolons but we are accepting of
75:49 - different coding styles here on the free
75:52 - code camp live stream so if you like
75:55 - semicolons that's cool and you can hang
75:57 - out with us too and if you don't like
76:00 - semicolons then that's cool too I don't
76:06 - think it matters that much as long as
76:08 - you're as long as your code works I
76:10 - think that's more important
76:16 - okay and actually I got through all the
76:19 - the questions so must be it's a slow day
76:25 - here with actually I just checked
76:26 - assuming my analytics are right now we
76:28 - do have a lot less viewers than normal
76:33 - so that would explain why there is not
76:35 - as much activity in the live chat we did
76:39 - get one more question so John Hanson
76:41 - says I read that full understanding of
76:44 - JavaScript isn't needed to work and
76:45 - react as it's a library to me it still
76:50 - feels too much a mystery it does things
76:52 - like magic at times is it better to
76:54 - build my es6 first hmm
77:03 - knowledge of es6 definitely helped me
77:06 - with react but I don't know this is
77:12 - necessary like there's always gonna be
77:13 - some magic
77:14 - I have heard I've heard the argument
77:16 - before that like you got to really
77:18 - understand what's going on I mean I used
77:20 - to hear years ago when I mean jQuery is
77:24 - still a big thing but before react was
77:27 - really big I guess I would I was more
77:31 - into jQuery and I would hear people say
77:33 - you know you really should read the
77:36 - source code for jQuery and understand
77:38 - how it works behind the scenes and I
77:41 - mean that's okay but to me it's like
77:43 - jQuery was awesome starting out because
77:46 - you didn't have to know how it all
77:47 - worked it just worked and you could use
77:49 - it so if if you go behind the scenes and
77:54 - read everything and how would they do it
77:56 - it was jQuery then why not just write it
77:58 - in vanilla JavaScript and not import all
78:01 - of jQuery if you know how to do it so I
78:04 - don't necessarily agree with that
78:06 - argument if if your goal is to learn how
78:09 - everything works in and out then yeah go
78:12 - for it but if your goal is just to make
78:14 - things that work you don't need to know
78:18 - all the magic behind the scenes if you
78:20 - do would you be better at it probably
78:23 - there's definitely in particular what
78:27 - - - performance so if you don't
78:31 - understand things right behind the
78:32 - scenes you may not realize why doing
78:34 - things one way is you know way more
78:36 - performant than knowing them another way
78:38 - right because you don't know what's
78:41 - going on you just do something and it
78:42 - works right so when it comes down to
78:44 - things like that
78:45 - a better understanding will definitely
78:48 - help but you know we're talking about
78:51 - usually with those questions the
78:53 - difference of milliseconds on small
78:55 - projects that's not a big deal I mean if
78:58 - you're not working on really huge
78:59 - projects you know all that adds up and
79:02 - you know you really you know if saving a
79:05 - few milliseconds makes a big difference
79:08 - saving a little bit of you know
79:10 - computing time makes a big difference
79:12 - but if you're just starting out in
79:15 - building some projects with react and
79:16 - they're not huge and they're not you
79:19 - know not really important in the sense
79:21 - that like a lot of people are dependent
79:24 - on it for let's say like banking or
79:29 - medical things or things that you know
79:32 - potentially could have a huge impact on
79:33 - people's lives then I I say don't worry
79:36 - about it you know you can use it as long
79:38 - as you can use it enough to build
79:40 - something with I don't think there's
79:41 - there's anything wrong with that and
79:43 - then as you use it your knowledge will
79:45 - increase so I just say if you're going
79:49 - to use it and you're not confident in
79:51 - your knowledge of es6 or of other
79:52 - JavaScript just make sure that you build
79:56 - up that knowledge as you go I think it
80:02 - would it would be wrong to just try to
80:03 - do reactant and never try to learn
80:06 - although I think it would be really hard
80:08 - to do react and not learn more about
80:10 - JavaScript as you're doing it I think
80:13 - that just it just happens naturally as
80:15 - you learn to do more things with react
80:17 - so anyway that's my opinion about it I
80:19 - know people would disagree cuz I've read
80:21 - and heard other opinions about that but
80:24 - there's something to be said for the
80:26 - confidence builder of actually making
80:28 - things making things that work and are
80:31 - cool you know at some point you just got
80:33 - to take that step and just start using
80:35 - things trying them out yeah maybe you
80:38 - don't understand completely how it works
80:40 - but
80:41 - like you don't need to I mean we don't
80:43 - really need to you know you don't write
80:45 - you don't need to know everything about
80:47 - electricity and how it works to be able
80:51 - to use you know a computer or I mean
80:54 - think about all the things that go into
80:55 - a computer working we don't need to know
80:57 - all that stuff or does that do you know
81:00 - all the NPM packages that you have going
81:02 - on behind the scenes and how they work
81:04 - no of course not
81:05 - right if somebody did know all that
81:07 - stuff could they make something that's
81:09 - really performant probably but that's
81:14 - just it's just crazy to learn all that
81:16 - so at some point you have to say you
81:19 - know what I'm you know here's where my
81:23 - skill level is at right now I'm gonna do
81:25 - what I can with this and I'll learn as I
81:28 - go along anyway that kind of turned into
81:30 - a rant a little bit at the end so a husk
81:33 - sorry about that but anyway so I would
81:40 - say don't be afraid to try out react and
81:42 - do some things with it and you'll pick
81:45 - up what you need to pick up as you go
81:48 - along let's see John Hanson says true
81:53 - thanks problem is there's too much poor
81:54 - documentation waste people saw problem
81:57 - solved with examples it's hard to sister
81:59 - yeah definitely I agree yeah from that
82:03 - from that perspective it can be really
82:09 - hard to learn things with react if
82:11 - you're not familiar with es6 and you see
82:13 - all these examples with es6 in them then
82:17 - you you really have two issues one like
82:19 - you know I haven't saved since Monday
82:26 - yeah I think I saved on Monday and then
82:29 - didn't save possibly Saturday I can't
82:34 - remember I like sitting down to Shaving
82:37 - like once a week now I've just gotten
82:38 - really lazy about it
82:45 - it's alright I mean luckily where I work
82:47 - there's no real policy on whether or not
82:50 - you have a beer to shave or anything
82:52 - like that so I could grow a giant bushy
82:54 - beard if I wanted to
82:56 - uh-huh but my wife wouldn't like that
83:00 - she's not a fan of the beard okay
83:04 - Oh horseshit says we'll be making
83:06 - another pool with the Mui awesome
83:08 - actually horseshit if you do that I'm
83:10 - going to be so happy if you get this
83:14 - this material you guys stuff working
83:18 - yeah I'll be awesome let's see okay well
83:24 - now I've again gotten to the bottom of
83:27 - the live chat so I guess I'm gonna go
83:33 - for real this time
83:34 - and I had a great time talking to you
83:36 - all so the actual coding portion of it
83:38 - for me was a bit disappointing just
83:40 - because my contributions all didn't work
83:42 - uh-huh but I did like the
83:46 - question-and-answer I enjoyed talking
83:48 - with you all I mean I really talked a
83:51 - lot but I like the questions that we had
83:56 - so it's Friday we got a nice weekend
84:01 - coming up and I'll be back on Monday but
84:05 - a Sebastian's here yeah you're late
84:07 - Sebastian I started early
84:10 - so you missed missed it basically if you
84:16 - want to know what we did this session
84:18 - check out pool request one on project
84:21 - four on the the react bulletin project
84:28 - because the thing that harsh the stuff
84:31 - that Harsha did in full request one is
84:33 - pretty much all that I got to work today
84:36 - everything I tried did not work so she
84:40 - didn't miss much there okay John Hanson
84:45 - says it's Thanksgiving holiday in Canada
84:47 - this weekend so happy Thanksgiving to
84:50 - you Jesse awesome Happy Thanksgiving
84:52 - so yes everyone oh my
84:56 - their neighbors in Canada have a happy
84:59 - Thanksgiving this weekend
85:05 - cool all right yeah so everybody have a
85:08 - great weekend especially those in Canada
85:10 - I have a great holiday weekend and I'll
85:13 - be back Monday and hopefully I'll have a
85:18 - more successful a time one one day but
85:22 - sorry I couldn't find the button to end
85:25 - this dream so I was just kind of
85:27 - stalling all right but anyway have a
85:29 - great weekend I see you all on Monday
