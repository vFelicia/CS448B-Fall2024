00:07 - everybody welcome to lab coding with
00:09 - Jesse I'm Jesse and I'm so glad to be
00:13 - back after it's been a while I think the
00:16 - last time I streamed was the 19th of
00:20 - July so if you don't know I had surgery
00:26 - on my wrist and I will spare you the
00:29 - sight of my my scars for my surgery I
00:32 - just got my stitches out this morning
00:34 - and so it's been a little rough trying
00:38 - to type my wrist is finally getting to
00:41 - the point where it's strong enough that
00:42 - I could tight for a while so doctor said
00:46 - probably like six weeks before it's
00:49 - actually starts to feel better than it
00:51 - did before the surgery and probably
00:53 - won't be like really feeling back back
00:56 - to normal for about three months so I'm
00:59 - just gonna take it easy not lift lift
01:02 - heavy weights or anything like that but
01:04 - you know typing should be okay I was
01:08 - able to do some work from home so I'm
01:10 - gonna catch you up on what I've done and
01:13 - then we'll get to it and we'll start
01:16 - working on this the search component
01:20 - that we worked on a while ago and then
01:21 - we just kind of left it there because we
01:24 - needed some work with the data before we
01:26 - could really finish it so we finally got
01:28 - that work done now we're gonna go back
01:29 - and finish it so hey everyone see a lot
01:32 - of people saying hi Julia
01:34 - so glad that you could make it to to a
01:37 - stream so that's awesome
01:40 - Phoenix hey I guess I'm just gonna say
01:44 - hi to everybody
01:46 - all right cool so for those of you who
01:50 - are new this is how it goes
01:53 - after I do a little explanation of
01:55 - what's been done since the last stream
01:57 - we're gonna do a 25-minute Pomodoro
01:59 - session of coding and then I'll take a
02:02 - five-minute break and answer all your
02:03 - questions will do another 25-minute
02:05 - Pomodoro session of coding and then
02:07 - after that we'll just do a question and
02:09 - answer session where I'll answer all
02:11 - your questions until there are no
02:13 - more so if you do have a question and it
02:16 - seems like I'm ignoring you
02:17 - I am but just for 25 minutes and then
02:20 - I'll answer you okay so let me let me
02:28 - think what I've done all right so here's
02:30 - some stuff that may be important for you
02:33 - to know if you are actively working on
02:36 - this project locally I upgraded a lot of
02:39 - things a lot of packages so I've
02:42 - upgraded next I've upgraded react I've
02:45 - upgraded material UI so you definitely
02:49 - need to run yarn or npm install if
02:54 - you're going to pull this down if you've
02:56 - already had it because a lot of things
02:59 - have changed I've been working mainly
03:02 - with I guess the menus right so the side
03:09 - menu if you notice has all new
03:12 - navigation and almost all of the links
03:15 - work now there's some that I just don't
03:17 - have content for yet but that that's
03:21 - pretty much sorted out now that took a
03:23 - while I've also moved I've got a little
03:28 - bit more organized I went back to using
03:30 - the Trello board so let me know if
03:32 - anybody's interested in and having a
03:34 - link to the Trello board to see where
03:35 - we're at and what still needs done in
03:37 - the project I can definitely share that
03:39 - I took care of some of the issues on
03:41 - github and I also added a few more
03:42 - issues so if you're interested in
03:44 - helping out a contributing check out the
03:46 - issues there there may be some new ones
03:47 - that you know you you may be interested
03:51 - in helping with okay that's that's an
03:55 - okay summary I'm sure I'm forgetting a
03:57 - lot of things but of course you can all
04:00 - check out the commit log on github if
04:02 - you really want to know you know
04:04 - specifically what's changed let me get
04:06 - my face off the screen here and look at
04:09 - some code all right I'm gonna start my
04:12 - Pomodoro timer and I'm also gonna start
04:19 - what do we have
04:21 - and grok let me make sure I have this
04:26 - yeah have the dev server server running
04:28 - let's start n Gras
04:31 - I'm about to paste this link in the live
04:33 - chat if you click on this link or copy
04:36 - and paste it in your browser you will be
04:38 - able to see the website and it will
04:40 - update as I'm changing it locally so
04:44 - you'll be able to click around go to any
04:46 - page that you want inspect it with your
04:49 - own dev tools it kind of makes it a
04:51 - little bit more interactive than just me
04:54 - coding and in you watching okay so let's
05:01 - go to this search page I haven't had
05:06 - been able to do any coding yet this
05:08 - morning I've been doing mostly paperwork
05:10 - since I had this is the first day back
05:13 - in the office since the 19th so I'm late
05:17 - on some of my paperwork let's see okay
05:22 - so here's the search page let me make
05:23 - this a bit bigger also not sure if any
05:30 - of you are from or around Salt Lake City
05:34 - Utah but I'm gonna be there for react
05:36 - rally is it next week
05:39 - it can't be next week that'd be I think
05:41 - it is though alright so I think next
05:43 - week I'm gonna leave I think the 13th my
05:46 - flight goes out so I'll be in Salt Lake
05:48 - City for a couple days so let me know if
05:50 - if you're there if you're in the area if
05:52 - you want to hang out or something and
05:53 - then I'll be in New York right after
05:56 - that so if anybody is I'll be staying in
06:00 - Brooklyn for a couple days so let me
06:03 - know if anybody's in that area wants to
06:05 - hang out you know we try to get together
06:08 - have some coffee do some coding or
06:10 - whatever okay I don't need this right
06:16 - now so let's kind of move that over and
06:17 - make some room let me know if this font
06:19 - needs to be even bigger okay so here's
06:24 - what's going on in this component so you
06:25 - can see we've already done quite a lot
06:27 - with this just to break it down we're
06:30 - using the WordPress API
06:34 - to get data from WordPress which we're
06:37 - using as our content management system
06:39 - and this search base let me show you the
06:44 - the front-end how this looks so I don't
06:49 - have a link to it so you need to
06:51 - manually type in search so at the end of
06:56 - that end Rock link that i typed in if
06:57 - you do slash search you'll come to the
06:59 - search page alright and this is just a
07:01 - live search so so as you type it will
07:08 - pop up with the results it should it's
07:11 - actually going quite slow so I may have
07:14 - to think about some way to fix that I
07:18 - think because we've added so many
07:20 - different post types but if you remember
07:23 - how it was before now there's a lot more
07:27 - information different post types that
07:32 - are now showing up in the search and
07:35 - then we have this sorting but we also
07:38 - have these filters and these are the
07:41 - ones that we put in a while ago so you
07:43 - see we can filter and just get you know
07:46 - what we want here
07:47 - so we need to add a lot more filters now
07:50 - that we have a lot more content types
07:52 - right so that's what we're gonna do I
07:56 - want to try to accomplish that now
07:58 - there's still a few other things I'd
07:59 - like to do with this page but the
08:01 - primary thing now are getting these
08:03 - filters in there okay so here's what's
08:08 - happened so far we have I've added in
08:19 - some things into state our initial state
08:24 - under these check boxes but then I
08:29 - thought hmmm
08:34 - sorry about that I've been trying to
08:36 - hold back a yawn for a couple of minutes
08:37 - now my sleep schedule has been all
08:41 - messed up since I've been off so I
08:43 - didn't get that much sleep last night so
08:49 - what I was thinking is instead of
08:51 - manually entering a lot of these
08:53 - different types in here you know maybe
08:57 - we could do something programmatically
09:00 - so I down at the bottom of this
09:02 - component we can see all the different
09:07 - post types that we have now so I don't
09:12 - think we need to filter by all of these
09:14 - post types some of them are things that
09:18 - it's not really likely that somebody
09:20 - would even filter by that but a lot of
09:22 - these will become filters okay so I
09:32 - think I have two check boxes in the
09:37 - state to create the form controller so I
09:41 - think what we're gonna do is actually
09:44 - let's look at this are these the only
09:46 - ones I want to have now let's try it out
09:50 - on here so we already have Department
09:52 - major and faculty that are check boxes
09:55 - but what I'd like to do is instead of
09:56 - just having these let's say manually put
10:00 - in which I'll scroll down a second to
10:01 - show you what I mean by that I'd like to
10:04 - just map over these and create the check
10:06 - box elements out of that so let's scroll
10:10 - down and find that I really want to
10:13 - refactor this it's too big it's not
10:17 - necessary right now just need to get it
10:20 - to work first and then we can refactor
10:22 - all right where's uh here's our filters
10:27 - so you can see we have these form
10:32 - control labels so right now I have three
10:35 - form control labels here so it's it's
10:37 - hard coded but I think what we could do
10:40 - what makes a lot more sense is just map
10:43 - over the the check box
10:47 - labels that the names that we have in
10:49 - state and then we'll have them all in
10:52 - there later on if we want to add more it
10:55 - will make it easier it'll cut down on
10:57 - the overall size of this component so
10:59 - that's the that's the plan for now I
11:06 - just happened to glance over and I at
11:09 - the live chat and no beer says a long
11:11 - time do you remember yeah for sure I
11:12 - remember so how's it going over here
11:15 - thanks for joining us
11:19 - okay so here's what we're gonna do we're
11:23 - gonna say this state it's going to
11:31 - JavaScript land first if you're in react
11:33 - and you put these little curly braces
11:35 - here then you can write JavaScript
11:37 - inside of those curly braces so we're
11:42 - gonna do map oops this state checkboxes
11:48 - dot map okay so map is gonna kind of
11:52 - like a loop right it's going to loop
11:54 - over everything and let us do stuff
11:56 - inside of there so we get to when we use
12:02 - a map the the first word that we're
12:06 - gonna put the first string or variable
12:08 - let's say that we're gonna put in here
12:09 - is basically anything we want it to be
12:11 - but that's gonna be the name for each
12:13 - item okay that I maps over so in this
12:16 - case I you know what I think I'll just
12:20 - put item a thing about putting checkbox
12:25 - but that's kind of long I like item
12:26 - better here and we're gonna use an arrow
12:28 - function okay and that arrow function
12:35 - when we use that it's going to
12:36 - automatically return whatever is in
12:38 - there so you don't need to actually
12:46 - write the word return and have it have
12:49 - it go in there
12:50 - okay so now we have the form control
12:52 - label and we need to use this item to
12:59 - get what we need
13:01 - so states so we want to keep that this
13:04 - state but it's gonna be actually we know
13:19 - we may have this maybe a little bit more
13:21 - tricky than I thought let me see
13:34 - yeah we're gonna need to do it like this
13:46 - yeah so let's just copy this for now so
13:52 - I'll explain this in a second I'm glad I
13:56 - caught that earlier okay so here's what
13:58 - you really need to do so you do to
14:01 - object entries this state checkboxes and
14:04 - we're going to map over them here okay
14:07 - and then we're going to get the key and
14:08 - the value
14:09 - okay that's gonna allow us to so the
14:20 - first way I believe what was going to
14:22 - happen is we were just going to get a
14:23 - bunch of falses as our initial values we
14:25 - weren't going to get the actual name
14:28 - that we wanted for the checkboxes in
14:29 - this case we're going to get the name so
14:31 - the key is going to be the name so let's
14:43 - let's get rid of this stuff okay
14:56 - all right so we have our form controller
14:58 - let me hit save so we get
15:01 - what does it sound cheap Rob so mad
15:05 - because I don't have a key
15:06 - all right let's give it a key so our key
15:18 - in this case is just going to be key
15:25 - okay and then all right these are just
15:30 - the indentation things right yeah all
15:34 - right now we could say for checked so we
15:44 - need to check to see if this check box
15:46 - is supposed to be checked and these are
15:48 - I can't believe just slip my mind
15:52 - controlled components
15:54 - I believe that's called let me know if
15:56 - you know what I'm trying to say and I'm
15:58 - saying it wrong but I believe it's
16:02 - controlled components
16:03 - basically what the value of this check
16:07 - box is determined by the state so when
16:10 - you click the check box it doesn't
16:12 - immediately cause a check what it does
16:15 - is it changes state and then a state
16:17 - change triggers re-render of the react
16:19 - component and when that rerender happens
16:22 - this check box this value for checked it
16:26 - goes to state to see whether it should
16:28 - be checked or not whether it should be
16:30 - true or false okay then that's when the
16:36 - the check box will actually get checked
16:38 - or not so from a user's perspective
16:40 - nothing changes but in the background it
16:44 - definitely is a different flow all right
16:50 - so I'm wondering if
16:54 - now let's just let's keep it like this
16:56 - so I think this will work
17:00 - once I really sure but let's try it
17:04 - he whoops I'll see if that works and
17:08 - then on change this handle change and we
17:13 - need to pass it the the name here so
17:16 - we're going to say key and for value
17:21 - we're also gonna say key and then for
17:31 - our label we're gonna say key and we'll
17:36 - use a CSS to make that capitalized for
17:41 - now it's just gonna be all lowercase
17:44 - just like it is in state okay now we can
17:47 - remove these two form form control
17:53 - labels and oops I think I deleted a form
18:03 - group yep I did okay let me know if you
18:11 - have any questions about that I seems
18:14 - like I went through kind of fast and
18:15 - there is quite a bit to this component
18:17 - if you've never seen it before so just
18:19 - let me know and I can definitely go back
18:21 - over it a little bit more slowly and
18:24 - let's see trailing spaces
18:34 - all right for whatever reason my Auto
18:36 - formatting indentation is not fixing
18:39 - this those red lines are just for
18:42 - indentation so hey cool look at that so
18:45 - our checkboxes are there now for our
18:48 - filters let's see if it actually does
18:51 - anything though so first of all I'm just
18:53 - going to check for an error when we want
18:54 - to use the checkboxes cool so check out
19:03 - console it's warning me about a key for
19:09 - up here let me remove this first let's
19:15 - refresh this may have been old warnings
19:21 - all right cool so we don't really have
19:25 - those warnings those are old so we have
19:28 - fixed that
19:35 - hmm area okay so it seems like this is
19:39 - going a little bit slow okay all right
19:47 - but that part works so that's cool that
19:48 - was actually the most complicated part
19:50 - of what I wanted to do today let me
19:52 - check my time oh yeah we're good at
19:54 - plenty of time let's clean this up then
19:56 - with a little bit of CSS and we just
20:01 - need to have this capitalized so we can
20:05 - test it out right now should be what is
20:10 - it text oops
20:14 - text transform capitalize there we go
20:16 - yep that's it
20:17 - okay yeah so let's go ahead put a text
20:21 - transform capitalize on these and we can
20:23 - do it right here on the well actually
20:31 - let's see if we could do it on here
20:33 - these components are material UI
20:38 - components I'm assuming that it'll just
20:41 - pass that style prop on down but I'm not
20:44 - exactly sure and the reason I'm going to
20:47 - do this in line is because it's only one
20:50 - thing we're adding on there usually I
20:53 - don't like to put a like make a whole
20:56 - nother class for one thing and react
20:58 - it's actually I mean it's arguable here
21:02 - but it's somewhat easier to read if you
21:06 - see the whole component here with the in
21:07 - line style and you can you can do it but
21:10 - if it starts are going to be two three
21:11 - four and line styles that's way too much
21:13 - it clutters things up and in that case
21:15 - we would end up putting it down here
21:17 - with the rest of our style C so we can
21:20 - add you know a lot of them and it's not
21:23 - really a huge deal in terms of clutter
21:26 - okay so in this case we'll do text
21:29 - transform and we'll say capitalize
21:38 - all right I'm assuming I spelled that
21:41 - right we'll find out in a second
21:42 - yeah all right cool
21:47 - Department made your factory isn't it
21:49 - awesome all right so this is basically
21:52 - our search page right now I'm not like a
21:55 - hundred percent thrilled with the way
21:57 - this looks it looks super plain so any
21:59 - ideas you all have to make this page
22:02 - look a little bit nicer I'm definitely
22:04 - open for that I do want to talk I guess
22:10 - for a second about why this is so slow
22:12 - and see if any of you all have any ideas
22:15 - for how we can make this faster so it
22:18 - was way faster originally and here's
22:25 - what I think happened so let's go up to
22:29 - our search string so we're adding on to
22:32 - the end of this string like all these
22:35 - different post types right so we
22:38 - actually have to say I want to search
22:40 - each individual post type like we can't
22:43 - just do a search for all of them at once
22:44 - the API doesn't allow that so this is
22:48 - how I had to do it so what that ends up
22:50 - creating hope leus was shown and that
22:56 - word
23:02 - she's the that should be
23:14 - trying to get this there we got one of
23:17 - those two faculty no I don't want that
23:21 - right now let me refresh so we we get
23:23 - rid of a lot of this there we go
23:28 - all right look how long this is I'm
23:31 - gonna copy this area all right let me
23:38 - copy this and just throw it in here in
23:44 - wow I have so much stuff all right so
23:50 - look at this look how long this is look
23:53 - at how many different post types it has
23:55 - to go through and I'm talking about on
23:57 - the WordPress side of things with the
23:59 - API it has to go through all of this so
24:02 - I think that's what's slowing it down so
24:08 - if anybody is knows about PHP databases
24:12 - WordPress and has any ideas of how we
24:14 - can make this faster let me know let me
24:17 - share with you one idea that I have so
24:24 - from what I've heard okay from other
24:27 - people that do kind of really advanced
24:29 - things with WordPress the folder
24:31 - structure in the WordPress database it's
24:33 - a my sequel database so sorry I don't
24:36 - mean that the table structure is not as
24:40 - efficient as it could be so potentially
24:44 - what's possible and I know people have
24:46 - done this is to change the structure to
24:49 - make it work more efficiently
24:51 - I'd really would not like to get into
24:53 - doing that but that's maybe one possible
24:58 - solution to basically customize the the
25:05 - database for this type of thing for
25:10 - search right I don't know let me know if
25:15 - anybody has ever even heard of that
25:16 - being done or what you think I know
25:18 - there is a plugin that was shared with
25:22 - me certainly if you did that Christian
25:25 - may have shared
25:27 - I don't know if he's here right now in
25:28 - the stream but I believe he shared it on
25:31 - one of the issues and in the github repo
25:34 - I think so I'll have to go back through
25:36 - and find it so we may be able to use a
25:38 - wordpress plugin to do this and not have
25:40 - to like manually manipulate the database
25:42 - so I think the speed is just it's a
25:47 - problem it's it should definitely not be
25:49 - that slow all right let me check it time
25:54 - like five minutes all right to know
25:57 - about five minutes I'm going to go to
25:59 - the live chat and answer all your
26:01 - questions so hang in there if you have
26:03 - if you have questions oh wait a second
26:05 - Rohan says cache the output of the
26:09 - WordPress API and say that server-side
26:20 - okay actually I kind of like that idea
26:22 - all right let's think about that idea
26:25 - also I just saw Jeff said there's a
26:27 - graphic you'll plug in we are using the
26:28 - graph QL plug-in but unfortunately the
26:30 - graph QL plug-in does not support search
26:33 - like this so that's why we had to use
26:35 - the API so basically for the rest of
26:37 - this app we are using graph QL and then
26:41 - for the search we're using the WordPress
26:43 - API we may have to use it in some other
26:46 - places too which we'll probably get into
26:49 - that in a different stream all right
27:02 - let's let's clean this up just a bit
27:06 - while we're waiting for the the timer to
27:14 - go off here I mean we can potentially
27:19 - try to save a little bit of time with
27:23 - this debounce I mean if we drop this
27:29 - debounce down to 300 milliseconds it
27:34 - could save us some time I don't think
27:36 - it's good I don't think that's the
27:37 - problem though it's not it's not the
27:39 - debounce it's a problem let's make down
27:53 - so see
28:01 - yeah it's still not
28:11 - does that even change it okay that was a
28:16 - little bit better
28:25 - you know what we also probably should do
28:27 - is put in loading indicator I mean
28:31 - that's it it would at least indicate to
28:34 - the user that something's happening so
28:39 - let's let's check that out do we have
28:42 - loading somewhere else we do where else
28:48 - are using loading I think on some of the
28:52 - pages so the timer's going off right now
28:53 - when we come back we'll probably end up
28:56 - doing is adding in some sort of loading
29:00 - indicator because regardless of whether
29:02 - we get the speed thing fixed it's still
29:04 - a good idea all right
29:08 - let's do five minute break so I'm not
29:12 - sure what kind of music y'all are into
29:13 - but there's a really good eighties
29:15 - playlist I've been listening to on
29:16 - Spotify it's called all-out 80s so if
29:18 - you enjoyed in the 80s check that out
29:21 - right now that's what I'm listening to
29:22 - you right now okay I'm gonna scroll all
29:26 - the way up to the top and work my way
29:27 - down and get through as much as I can in
29:29 - these five minutes probably won't get to
29:30 - everything because there's a lot but
29:32 - just hang in there and then after the
29:34 - next pummelo recession I'll go through
29:35 - everything yeah so alright yes some
29:41 - people asking if I'm okay
29:44 - so yeah my wrist is okay the surgery was
29:47 - successful is just gonna take me a while
29:48 - to get fully recovered so for now it
29:50 - actually feels worse than it did before
29:52 - the surgery but I'm hoping it will get
29:55 - better the thing that kind of stinks is
29:57 - like I was finally getting back into
29:58 - exercise and lifting and now like I
30:01 - won't be able to lift anything heavy so
30:04 - I won't be getting swole anytime soon
30:17 - okay an AK says can someone point me to
30:20 - the best way to learn Python please okay
30:22 - I personally don't know Python I've used
30:24 - it a little bit I know the Udacity intro
30:27 - to computer science course it does use
30:29 - Python so that might be a decent way to
30:32 - get into Python because you would learn
30:33 - Python at the same time that you would
30:35 - learn computer science principles so I
30:39 - would check that out of here if you like
30:41 - the Udacity style of course you can do
30:44 - it for free so that's the only resource
30:47 - that I know that I've used and learned a
30:50 - bit of Python from
31:04 - brotherman Britt says what programming
31:06 - language do I learn to start off okay
31:10 - well I personally would recommend
31:13 - JavaScript I really like JavaScript I
31:16 - think it's useful for so many different
31:17 - things because you can you can pretty
31:22 - much make anything with JavaScript there
31:25 - they're not a lot of other programming
31:26 - language is where you could easily do
31:28 - that so I would recommend JavaScript
31:31 - even to get started with it you can run
31:33 - it in your dev tools console so you
31:35 - don't even need anything special you
31:37 - don't need to load anything on your
31:38 - machine so that's what I'd recommend but
31:41 - if you have something you really want to
31:43 - do and another language is better suited
31:45 - to that then maybe try that out okay so
31:47 - if you're really into I don't listen
31:49 - machine learning Python seems to be
31:51 - where it's at right now with machine
31:52 - learning so maybe you want to learn
31:53 - Python first so there's not really going
31:56 - to be a one-size-fits-all answer to that
31:58 - question but I can at least give you
32:01 - what what my answer would be for you
32:04 - know what what I think is good it may
32:07 - not work for you though let's see
32:25 - yes says how to design a suggestion box
32:28 - and Daedalus I don't know how to answer
32:32 - if you want to you can DM me on Twitter
32:34 - or something - and we could talk more
32:36 - like specifically about your particular
32:40 - case that Brown says I'm working on the
32:48 - HTML cat photos I'm new to coding need
32:50 - some help okay so I'm assuming that's
32:51 - the free code camp cat photos things so
32:54 - again Browns if you want you can DME and
32:58 - I'll try to help up full stop says hi
33:01 - from Nepal hey how's it going thanks for
33:03 - joining us
33:05 - Blake says glad you're back I'm glad I'm
33:07 - happy to be back I missed your Anna says
33:12 - loved to contribute if I can Oh awesome
33:14 - and if you want more details on like
33:16 - what I need feel free to check out the
33:19 - issues on github leave comments there to
33:22 - get more details if you want you could
33:24 - DM me like definitely happy to if you
33:27 - would like to contribute I'm I'm happy
33:29 - to help with that Nimisha says hi from
33:36 - India I'm really sorry if I'm
33:38 - mispronouncing your name but house would
33:42 - go on there in India thanks for watching
33:46 - Robert says can you teach us MATLAB
33:49 - program please I don't I don't know
33:52 - anything about MATLAB so I'm not going
33:54 - to be the person that you want to teach
33:56 - you that if anybody in the chat now or
34:00 - even watching later you could put in the
34:02 - comments if you're in a MATLAB and
34:05 - interested in helping out with that or
34:07 - if you know of any good tutorials you
34:10 - know please let us know Rashid says hi
34:14 - Jesse from Indonesia hey how's it going
34:17 - what time is it in Indonesia right now
34:19 - I'm not sure what time zone that is but
34:23 - it's got to be late right I mean yeah
34:28 - it's got to be close to midnight over
34:32 - there
34:34 - Yeah right anyway okay I didn't get
34:39 - through everything but I got pretty far
34:42 - I'm gonna write down where I left off at
34:43 - cuz there's a lot going on in the chat
34:45 - today and I don't want to be able to get
34:47 - back to my place here okay
34:56 - all right so I'm gonna get back to the
34:59 - chat I know I didn't get through
35:00 - everything so just hang in there for a
35:02 - little bit longer if for some reason you
35:04 - can't stick around to hear my answer
35:05 - I'll still answer your question you can
35:07 - always watch the the recording of this
35:10 - video later on okay all right one more
35:17 - Pomodoro session let's try to get a
35:19 - little loading indicator and to speed
35:22 - this up I'm gonna check out another page
35:24 - where we are you already using a loading
35:26 - indicator and try to maybe take that
35:29 - code and see if we can use it maybe
35:32 - modify a little bit that'll be a good
35:35 - start so do we have it on it not on
35:38 - index page judge is there we go oh I see
35:45 - what we're doing
35:48 - okay so we're using graph QL in this
35:51 - case and it says if the result is
35:54 - loading hmm sorry about all these yawns
36:02 - then we just do the loading indicator
36:04 - okay
36:13 - okay I don't know that we're going to be
36:16 - able to just take this so it's that's
36:21 - not a big deal though let's let's do our
36:24 - own thing
36:33 - okay so here's what we need to do
36:46 - okay so we have this fetch search term
36:54 - so what if we did we could put something
36:58 - in state alright let's add in the state
37:07 - loading and this would be SB you know
37:14 - true or false for loading so we'll set
37:16 - it to false by default okay and what we
37:20 - can do here then is say let me see if
37:31 - there's somewhere better to put this I
37:32 - don't think there is but I think it's
37:35 - worth a shot
37:41 - okay alright so the first thing we'll do
37:45 - here when we go to fetch a search term
37:48 - with this set state and it'll say
37:58 - loading loading true it's about right
38:07 - away as soon as it starts the search
38:09 - will set loading to true and then then
38:17 - here
38:27 - see if we can this at state data data
38:33 - and then although loading false I think
38:43 - I can do that we'll see it's not worth
38:49 - looking it up at this point I think it's
38:51 - worth just saving it and seeing what
38:52 - happens actually let's let's put in
38:56 - something down here that'll actually
38:58 - show up so that we can get a nice visual
39:02 - so the container I wanted to go below
39:18 - all right so this is what it'll be here
39:21 - it'll say loading oops this states
39:25 - loading so this state loading and let's
39:33 - just put will just do just like we did
39:39 - in the other thing looting
39:46 - okay all right so what this will do is
39:48 - check for this state loading if this
39:51 - state loading is true then it'll go to N
39:54 - and it'll check what's here and in that
39:56 - case it'll actually render this but if
39:58 - this state loading is false it'll just
40:01 - stop there and it won't even check the
40:02 - end because this statement will have
40:04 - failed immediately right see if it works
40:12 - okay so no immediate I want to see the
40:18 - console here
40:19 - let's clear that console out and we'll
40:23 - try to search nice okay let's see if we
40:30 - get the same thing here okay cool
40:35 - so we do have that loading that pops up
40:38 - and it stays here I mean that does look
40:41 - a little bit weird
40:48 - but I think that I mean that's not bad I
40:52 - don't know what's up with me today so
40:54 - for everything I've tried has worked
40:55 - it's just it's amazing it's never
40:58 - happens
41:00 - okay all right well that works for now
41:05 - it would be kind of cool to have a nicer
41:08 - looking loader so let's just let's check
41:12 - out material UI just to see if AB a
41:15 - loader I don't think they do the last
41:17 - time I checked they didn't but maybe
41:19 - they've got something with an update so
41:25 - you're loading indicate what is this
41:30 - Oh progress blur nice that's cool they
41:37 - have them now all right what do you
41:42 - think I really like these circular
41:44 - things but let's check out some of the
41:46 - other things just to be sure the linear
41:54 - indicators are kind of cool
42:04 - hmm
42:09 - alright let me know what you think I'm
42:10 - gonna give everybody 30 seconds to let
42:12 - me know whether you want the circle
42:14 - loader or the linear progress it's a
42:18 - progress bar right progress indicators
42:22 - so let me know circular or linear I'm
42:27 - gonna look at the code for it while I'm
42:29 - waiting I'm gonna estimate 30 seconds so
42:33 - I'm not really gonna count to 30
43:03 - I'm starting to get some oh okay well
43:07 - linear linear linear linear circuit is
43:12 - too common do the linear michael says
43:18 - circular if the Lund years often cost
43:20 - for station I thought that too but we
43:22 - could do the indeterminate linear so
43:25 - that the you know there they won't so
43:29 - the linear determinant would indicate
43:31 - that like we're actually gonna get
43:33 - results when it hits the end and I don't
43:34 - want to mess with that I mean that would
43:36 - kind of be cool but I don't want to mess
43:38 - with that but we could do this
43:39 - indeterminate so it's just saying like
43:41 - hey something's gonna happen we're not
43:43 - telling you in though alright so it
43:48 - seems overwhelming that we're gonna go
43:52 - linear indeterminate so that's cool I I
43:56 - was surprised by that I was leaning more
43:59 - towards the circle but let's go with the
44:01 - linear indeterminate so we've never used
44:03 - one of these before in any of the
44:04 - projects so this will be cool so first
44:08 - of all let's grab this and import this
44:13 - linear let me make this bigger a little
44:15 - bit bigger so we're gonna import linear
44:18 - progress let's go all the way up here
44:23 - there's so many imports on this page and
44:27 - then I can't wait till we can refactor
44:32 - that number mats
44:38 - there we go okay now we don't even oh
44:45 - cool we don't even need to add any the
44:47 - the styles we can just grab this linear
44:51 - progress and that's nice
44:57 - this is super simple wow this is even
45:00 - easier than the circular so we're gonna
45:05 - pray replace this h1 loading with our
45:09 - linear progress save that and see how it
45:13 - looks
45:25 - nice
45:32 - oh I like that I like that what do y'all
45:36 - think
45:40 - Wow that I really like that
45:50 - that's cool honestly that I don't know
45:54 - if it how it felt to you but to me it
45:56 - felt like the load times were actually
45:57 - faster I don't think they were faster it
46:00 - wouldn't make any sense we didn't do
46:02 - anything but just that that indication
46:05 - seemed like it went faster to me so
46:08 - that's that's really cool I didn't know
46:11 - I mean to click on that but let's see if
46:14 - this page actually works to be good and
46:17 - it did not
46:30 - since
46:38 - hmm
46:40 - all right so evidently our news face
46:43 - doesn't work yeah nothing you know I had
46:50 - somebody working on this I thought they
46:53 - got through all of them but maybe they
46:54 - didn't but I'm not getting into air or
46:57 - anything let's see how much time I have
47:01 - 13 minutes okay cool
47:04 - actually this is a good opportunity to
47:06 - show you a little bit of how the
47:07 - wordpress side looks on this so let me
47:15 - there we go let me go on here make this
47:19 - a bit bigger so here's the wordpress you
47:22 - see we have a ton of custom post types
47:25 - happening here if you want to see how we
47:27 - did that
47:28 - check out the repository for the fus
47:32 - wordpress plugin it's in the same github
47:38 - organization as the repository for this
47:41 - project is links in the description
47:44 - let's go into or yet news I can find it
47:51 - I really need to alphabetize these there
47:58 - we are things just grow sometimes you
48:01 - know you have a short list you can find
48:03 - everything and then you just keep adding
48:05 - a little by little and eventually
48:07 - without even realizing it's it's a mess
48:09 - and it started finding it so what was
48:11 - that news counting students
48:23 - see we can find this yeah there we go
48:30 - hmm okay so this obviously has continent
48:41 - let's check the slug so what should
48:45 - happen is based on that slug it should
48:48 - be able to find this this information so
48:54 - accounting students to assist local
48:56 - residents with accidents accounting
49:04 - students to assist local residents with
49:06 - taxes
49:11 - yeah it should work right news good
49:15 - students hmm
49:23 - okay so I don't think it's a problem
49:26 - with the way these were done in
49:28 - WordPress this looks looks good so I
49:32 - mean I know we're going kind of off off
49:34 - the topic of what I set out for this
49:37 - dream but if you don't mind let's check
49:39 - out what's going on with our graph QL
49:40 - queries for the for the news pages so go
49:45 - to news real quick and let's see we're
49:50 - doing where's our query so we're using
49:54 - Apollo to help us with our our graph QL
49:56 - stuff and we're using page query and
49:59 - then we're passing it the name okay so
50:03 - let's go to our page query there's all
50:06 - our graph QL queries page page we're
50:13 - type
50:18 - did we not pass a type I don't think we
50:23 - passed the type you're okay we're not
50:29 - passing a type that's why I didn't work
50:30 - okay let's let's figure out a place
50:36 - where we are passing a tight area
50:47 - no wait we are we are to the query what
50:50 - am I thinking we are passing a type oh
50:54 - no that's the page go back to news no we
50:58 - definitely are my fault I don't know why
51:01 - I didn't see that
51:01 - okay so we're passing a type to the page
51:04 - query we're passing the ID
51:27 - let me check this data for secondary
51:34 - you've got too much stuff one
51:41 - I wonder if
51:47 - I wonder if any of this is is messing it
51:50 - up I did have an issue at some point
51:55 - where depending on if if one of these
51:58 - were found it would just basically not
52:00 - doing anything would freeze up
52:13 - let's check our check our stuff in here
52:31 - accounting sues justice local residents
52:34 - okay yeah that's definitely it's
52:40 - definitely the right stuff I mean make
52:42 - try to make this bigger for you so we
52:44 - can directly look at what our state and
52:47 - props are at any given point here with
52:51 - our reactive tools so that's what we're
52:53 - doing right now just to get an idea of
52:55 - where where the problem lies like if
52:58 - we're getting the data back and it is
53:00 - stored in props then we know that the
53:04 - issue is kind of like after that point
53:06 - so this will help narrow it down for us
53:18 - okay there's our ID
53:25 - okay cool here's our query where name
53:27 - equals accounting students
53:40 - let's see did we get alright cool so
53:46 - we're getting we have this content so we
53:51 - have it all right we have the content we
53:53 - have the title okay
54:05 - all right so let's actually I want to
54:08 - take this title out we don't need that
54:10 - in here I want to leave this it's double
54:18 - check
54:18 - okay we're putting the content in there
54:20 - so our content data edges no consonants
54:35 - all right so we've got the data the
54:37 - problem I guess is somewhere in here
54:53 - I'm gonna check the live chat in case
54:55 - you are seeing something that I am NOT
55:06 - I just see we had a comment from who
55:10 - here though I'm probably mess your name
55:13 - up I'm really sorry let me know how to
55:14 - pronounce it and I'll say it right the
55:15 - next time but anyway the comment says I
55:18 - like you so it just caught my eye there
55:22 - Thanks
55:23 - thanks for watching I appreciate the
55:24 - government alright alright let's try to
55:30 - do instead of content let's maybe
55:33 - directly do let's try this
55:45 - let's go with div and let's see what
55:57 - we're getting and I want to just say
56:00 - data
56:10 - area okay little sloppy here but okay so
56:16 - we go we are getting this data it's
56:18 - under news edges node news edges node
56:28 - title okay all right let's make sure
56:31 - we're doing that right okay so under
56:33 - data should have news this site okay I
56:47 - see what's happening
56:59 - do we need that
57:11 - so if the data already yeah we will have
57:14 - to say news what's the type though that
57:16 - we're getting let's go back to to this I
57:22 - want to see what the type is okay the
57:32 - type is a news and this says a news all
57:36 - right so that should work so you should
57:38 - be able to get data with this drop stage
57:42 - let's just verify that that would work
57:54 - all right that did work I'm just gonna
57:56 - go down the chain here and see what
57:58 - we're messing up edges zero yep that
58:08 - works edges zero one let's just do it
58:10 - node node and this good title there we
58:21 - go yep that should be there why is the
58:23 - title on isn't it anyway
58:27 - okay all right so that's working
58:39 - maybe it's because we're going
58:41 - dangerously set innerhtml
58:48 - yeah let's switch this up
59:10 - hmm
59:32 - that's a little weird how they're
59:34 - organizing that but okay so something's
59:42 - happening with this
59:49 - the straight title
60:06 - all right that's really weird but if we
60:10 - do this
60:26 - so weird alright so evidently something
60:29 - I'm doing here is it's messing this up
60:39 - probably because I'm doing it like this
60:53 - and I bet this works now yep that works
61:02 - all right here's the problem I apologies
61:07 - if you notice this and we're trying to
61:08 - tell me in the chat and I didn't see it
61:10 - but I don't I have no idea why I didn't
61:13 - see this I wasn't actually creating like
61:16 - these direct variables right so I'd
61:18 - probably just copy and pasted this
61:21 - result you know this conch data and I
61:26 - left the the brackets around it right
61:30 - but I wasn't trying to get like an
61:33 - object right this I wanted to be an
61:35 - object I didn't want these to be objects
61:37 - but I was that's what I was making them
61:39 - so anyway that was the problem so I
61:46 - don't know I tried to be systematic
61:47 - about finding that error and that's
61:50 - usually a good way to go you'll find it
61:52 - in this case if I would have just jumped
61:54 - in and just took a look at the code
61:55 - maybe I would have saw that and changed
61:57 - it I don't know but anyway that works
62:03 - now my timer did go off but let's commit
62:06 - some of this and get it up to get up
62:07 - that way y'all can check it out
62:10 - let me alright let's see my my node want
62:17 - has been doing weird stuff where it just
62:19 - keeps refreshing all the time and it
62:21 - won't let me run my tests so we'll see
62:23 - if it does that we may have to just kind
62:25 - of manually start the server just for
62:27 - the test but for now let's do a git
62:29 - status as soon as I push this up to get
62:33 - up I'm gonna go back to the questions
62:34 - and answer all your questions alright
62:37 - cool so these are the only two pages
62:39 - that we did work with so that's good
62:41 - first let's do a git commit and we're
62:45 - gonna commit the search page loops pages
62:50 - search
62:54 - I'm sorry what am I thinking I need to
62:57 - do it get ad there we are I'm going to
63:01 - do yarn CM okay because we have it set
63:05 - up to help us out making our commit
63:07 - messages otherwise you could just do a
63:09 - git commit and then add your message so
63:11 - let's add a new feature and we'll say
63:14 - add checkboxes let's say filter and what
63:27 - LC Oh loader a loading indicator and I
63:36 - don't think we had any that attach to an
63:39 - issue so I'm just gonna skip that okay
63:44 - so hopefully all the tests run I can
63:46 - start answering questions now while we
63:47 - let these tests are on if they'll pass
63:51 - then we'll move on and make the next
63:53 - commit I'll push those up to get up and
63:55 - then everything we've done today will be
63:56 - available to you all on the github repo
63:59 - so let me scroll back up to where I left
64:01 - off in the chat
64:03 - oh cool those all passed let's get let's
64:10 - add the news page now yeah and we're
64:18 - gonna say this is definitely gonna be a
64:24 - fix
64:25 - [Music]
64:30 - so say 6c
64:41 - dispense the ISP you spelled displace
64:48 - hey Ron this place yeah that's it
64:50 - isn't it weird out just simple words
64:53 - sometimes like you know you spelled them
64:55 - a million times but all of a sudden you
64:57 - just you forget anyway content now
64:59 - displays properly okay
65:13 - oh man Phil Collins just playing right
65:15 - now I'm on Spotify in the air tonight
65:19 - it's my favorite Phil Collins song if
65:24 - you see my head moving like if that's
65:26 - why all right cool
65:33 - that's ready we'll do a get push and
65:36 - it'll all be up to github great okay so
65:43 - where were we
65:45 - okay an access how long of a time
65:49 - usually does it take the average person
65:51 - to learn Python
65:53 - I really have no idea and I haven't
65:57 - learned Python myself and really it it
65:59 - definitely depends on like your your
66:01 - natural ability like how much knowledge
66:03 - you have coming into it and then how
66:06 - much time you have to dedicate you know
66:09 - each day to learning it so that's that's
66:11 - going to be a question that even for
66:14 - yourself will be hard to answer you know
66:15 - and you'd know better than anybody which
66:17 - your capabilities are manju says how to
66:22 - start learn coding or other programming
66:25 - yeah it kind of depends on your
66:28 - preference for how you learn let's
66:31 - assume you're going to start with
66:32 - JavaScript okay if you wanted to start
66:36 - with JavaScript you could try out the
66:37 - free code camp curriculum that'd be a
66:41 - great way just keep doing those
66:43 - exercises if you prefer that like video
66:48 - learning style you could try out
66:49 - something like Udacity and do some of
66:52 - their free courses they come with a lot
66:55 - of videos if you wanted to just do
66:58 - videos no exercises you could certainly
67:00 - go on youtube and watch like buh buh
67:04 - Karns has a whole video series on the
67:06 - free code camp YouTube about learning
67:08 - JavaScript you could check that out if
67:09 - you like to read you can get the
67:12 - eloquent JavaScript book or the you
67:15 - don't know J S series those are both
67:18 - available for free to read online or you
67:21 - can get the the print copies if that's
67:24 - what you like so those would be my
67:26 - to get started
67:40 - all right michael says why not
67:41 - programmatically build the filter list
67:43 - from the the hits after you get the
67:47 - search results like only add the topics
67:50 - that show up oh that's interesting okay
67:54 - I'm have to think about that hmm
68:03 - yeah that would kind of be a nice
68:05 - feature I don't know that that's
68:07 - something that is necessary to get in
68:09 - before we launch but I do like that yeah
68:14 - I really like that that's a good idea
68:16 - oh by the way the launch date I mean
68:20 - obviously launch day it keeps getting
68:21 - pushed back for this thing I still need
68:23 - to have a meeting with some people from
68:26 - another department to get the okay for
68:28 - this to launch that meeting had to get
68:30 - pushed back now I'd like twice it's just
68:33 - hard to get all those people together
68:35 - and then because of my surgery we had to
68:37 - push it back so I believe the meeting
68:40 - now is set for the end of August so I'm
68:42 - thinking there's no way the site's gonna
68:44 - launch until at the earliest the very
68:48 - end of August maybe beginning of
68:50 - September so we'll be working on it for
68:54 - a little while but I mean that's not bad
68:55 - we have more time to make it look the
68:57 - way we want to optimize it you know add
69:01 - more features so I I kind of really want
69:05 - to launch it I've been wanting to launch
69:07 - it for a while but just can't I just I
69:11 - gotta wait for approval so that's where
69:13 - we're at in terms of launch
69:18 - Oh Sean asked what are we doing here
69:24 - today I assumed I was Sean that you
69:27 - figured it out at this point because you
69:28 - asked that quite a while ago so I'm vaga
69:31 - to go over it again
69:43 - okay ocean said it's a controlled
69:45 - component alright so when I was trying
69:47 - to say I don't even remember what I said
69:49 - if I said it right or not but when we're
69:51 - talking about our inputs in particular
69:53 - checkboxes there was a controlled
69:55 - component when I was mentioning that
69:57 - when you click it it doesn't actually
69:59 - directly change the check state of the
70:01 - checkbox what it does is it changes the
70:05 - states in react in your component and
70:08 - then the checked attribute of that
70:11 - checkbox is getting its value from state
70:15 - and the the update is triggered any time
70:18 - there's a react state change
70:31 - Julie asked to forget a playlist for
70:33 - these yeah yeah for sure so if you check
70:36 - out the free code camp playlist you'll
70:39 - see I have several playlists now so
70:41 - there's one main playlist that has all
70:43 - the videos I've ever done in the live
70:44 - coding with Jessie series and that's
70:46 - huge so I don't know if that's for
70:49 - everybody but this project has its own
70:52 - playlist and it's project five so if you
70:54 - check out the project 5 playlist it's
70:56 - just for this project this is stream 90
70:59 - of that playlist so there's quite a lot
71:01 - here so it'd be kind of crazy to have
71:04 - watch everything at this point I
71:05 - definitely recommend worth watching on
71:07 - like to time speed I think you can
71:10 - definitely understand me still a two
71:11 - times feed just slow it down is there
71:13 - something interesting I guess and maybe
71:16 - like skip around it to some of the
71:19 - videos over there topics that you're
71:20 - interested in I mean unless you really
71:23 - have a lot of time to kill and want to
71:25 - watch them all but it's it's a lot of
71:28 - time at this point no Bo says it's not
71:35 - really tutorials it's like group work in
71:38 - public yeah yeah yeah yeah it's true I
71:42 - know these aren't exactly tutorials
71:43 - because I don't like go through
71:45 - systematically and try to teach
71:46 - something but I hope that we all learn
71:48 - something though I definitely learn
71:51 - stuff from you all the time
71:56 - Christian Brown says don't forget
71:57 - shoutouts oh okay
72:01 - actually let me do that let's go to get
72:05 - up repo for a second get up I know I
72:12 - probably have this github repo open in 3
72:14 - other places right now but what I'm not
72:17 - signed into github are you serious
72:23 - that's crazy
72:25 - I haven't had to sign into forever and
72:28 - now I have to do my authentication
72:35 - all right let's see get Oh No don't you
72:43 - hate when the phone Authenticator
72:45 - changes right in the middle are you
72:46 - trying to put the code in okay so what I
72:57 - want to do is give shoutouts to those
72:59 - you that actually did submit pull
73:01 - requests recently so let's go here okay
73:09 - so Christopher brown has several pull
73:12 - requests so let's see the green keeper
73:15 - stuff is a bot that automatically sends
73:17 - pull requests when packages need updated
73:20 - so yes so Chris added these title
73:25 - elements to things so this is for
73:26 - accessibility purposes so thank you for
73:28 - that Chris let's see the faculty also
73:36 - this get faculty graph key to return a
73:38 - purple response
73:39 - y'all can check out the details of these
73:42 - of course if you want I mean this is a
73:43 - public repo Daniel and I'm not sure with
73:50 - the dates I'm getting kind of back a
73:51 - little bit more so yeah these are older
73:53 - ones I think we've already gone over but
73:55 - anyway and then just to show you all
73:59 - since I haven't done this for a while
74:00 - here's all the contributors to the
74:03 - project so thank you everyone who's
74:04 - contributed if you're interested in
74:06 - contributing just check out the issues
74:07 - you know let me know which one you're
74:09 - interested in so obviously me Nikki
74:11 - Harshit Chris are bought SDA Blandy
74:17 - elbow I know I wish I like could
74:23 - remember everybody's real names as
74:24 - opposed to their github names but
74:27 - Michael so there we are lots of
74:30 - contributors so far 12 contributors of
74:35 - which only one is not really a person so
74:38 - really awesome thank you
74:46 - Julia said I loved it thank you I
74:48 - appreciate that
74:57 - Roland said some SVG art assuming you're
75:01 - talking about sgv art for the for the
75:03 - progress indicator if that's the case
75:06 - actually I love SVG art I just don't
75:08 - really know how to do it I haven't spent
75:10 - time trying to do it but to have like a
75:13 - custom SVG loader the loading indicator
75:15 - would be super cool
75:27 - Oshin says what plug-in is that on the
75:30 - wordpress side sending you json data
75:31 - actually the the rest api for wordpress
75:34 - is built into WordPress core now so you
75:37 - don't need a plug-in anymore to get
75:39 - multiple posts though you need to get
75:41 - the the multiple post plug-in let's see
75:44 - which one that one is let's go to our
75:48 - plugins so we have the WP REST API v2
76:00 - multiple post types plug-in okay so
76:04 - that's going to allow you to put in
76:05 - search for multiple post types in one
76:08 - API request
76:19 - rod huh says hi hey how's it going
76:21 - thanks for watching
76:23 - Marino says what what did you had that
76:26 - was bad in your wrist I had some torn
76:28 - like a torn ligament they needed
76:30 - repaired as soon as says what is your
76:38 - recommended best way to style reacts
76:41 - style components standard CSS I use a
76:43 - variety of things to be honest with you
76:45 - I'm not sure which one I like best so
76:48 - I'm still trying out I'm trying things
76:51 - out you know and I'm open to trying to
76:52 - find the best way so I haven't decided
76:55 - yet which one I like the best 5 vibe
77:05 - Huff says say something interesting
77:07 - about progressive web apps ok alright so
77:12 - for any of you don't know what
77:13 - progressive web apps are I guess I'll
77:15 - just explain really briefly so they're
77:17 - usually abbreviated PWA but a
77:20 - progressive web app would be like a web
77:23 - app that could potentially work offline
77:27 - so everything that would be needed for
77:30 - that could be stored like in a
77:32 - serviceworker so the serviceworker is a
77:35 - special javascript file that sits in the
77:39 - in the browser in between your website
77:41 - and your server and it can intercept
77:44 - Network requests so potentially if you
77:46 - had everything you need to run your app
77:47 - in your serviceworker the requests would
77:50 - go to the serviceworker which still
77:52 - lives right there in the browser
77:53 - serviceworker would send back the
77:55 - response and it would never have to
77:57 - leave the browser or go to the server so
77:59 - if there was no internet it could still
78:00 - work so if you've ever used anything
78:03 - online that still works offline it's
78:07 - probably done using that type of service
78:10 - workers I'm thinking things like like
78:14 - Google Docs you can still use Google
78:16 - Docs even if you don't have an internet
78:17 - connection in your browser right so and
78:21 - we call it a progressive web app because
78:22 - you can't have everything there right
78:25 - depending on what your app is without
78:27 - connections so what would happen is like
78:29 - your base app functionality would work
78:31 - without a connection
78:32 - and then it would progressively get more
78:35 - functional as you had a better better
78:38 - connection so that's what we mean by
78:41 - progressive web apps so that's kind of
78:43 - the way to go now so if you can build
78:46 - your site and as a progressive web app
78:48 - then you probably should what we're
78:50 - building right now will work as a
78:52 - progressive web app aster says why do
78:59 - people use typescript with graph QL do
79:02 - you I don't use typescript with graph QL
79:04 - I recently saw a video about Peggy
79:09 - raises Cameron boy last name is but she
79:12 - works on the Apollo team and she was
79:17 - talking about using typescript with
79:19 - graph QL and so I assume like it's
79:23 - something that's encouraged by like
79:26 - Apollo and I'm not 100% sure what the
79:29 - benefits of doing it that way are I just
79:34 - I haven't used typescript that much at
79:36 - all I can definitely see value in it but
79:38 - for the stuff that I've been doing it
79:40 - just hasn't really been a big deal to
79:42 - try to use typescript so if anybody else
79:45 - knows better like why what advantage
79:48 - there would be to using typescript with
79:51 - graph QL please let us know Aster's is
79:54 - how did you learn graph QL not only just
79:59 - reading documentation tutorials and
80:01 - things really harsh it one of the
80:05 - viewers that that contributes a lot to
80:08 - projects really wanted to use graph QL
80:11 - and started using it with Apollo and he
80:13 - did a lot of you know in terms of pull
80:17 - requests and I would look through what
80:18 - he was doing and try to understand what
80:21 - he was going so I learned a lot that way
80:23 - just by reading his code and then
80:25 - editing it like taking what he did and
80:28 - then applying it to a different
80:29 - component and so that's that's I kind of
80:31 - really learned like hands-on you know
80:34 - and there's still so much I don't know
80:37 - about it
80:37 - I was just watching a tutorial on it
80:40 - this morning
80:45 - our tge 34 says if I wanted to be a UX
80:48 - designer what degree would you recommend
80:50 - I don't really know for a design degree
80:56 - hmm I touch you I'm not sure I don't
81:04 - know what like what it would be called
81:06 - you know and different schools would
81:09 - would probably have different degrees
81:11 - available so and that seems like a job
81:14 - you may not even need a degree for so
81:16 - sorry I can't answer that better but
81:19 - maybe it's just slip in my mind but yeah
81:25 - I don't know
81:29 - sergey serb says does he even read
81:31 - comments on youtube I do try to read the
81:33 - comments I know I'm behind on the on the
81:37 - comments but I do I think I try to go
81:42 - back when I get a chance and try to look
81:44 - and see with who's who commented and so
81:47 - I do apologize if I've missed a comment
81:54 - aster says how many react projects do
81:57 - you recommend a junior dev have before
81:59 - applying at least one I would say and
82:05 - then after that apply Reigate this is a
82:10 - similar question that I get is how do
82:12 - you know when you're ready to apply for
82:13 - jobs and I would say you're ready to
82:15 - have a job whenever you can convince
82:17 - somebody that you're ready right you go
82:18 - into that that interview if you get an
82:21 - interview and you convince somebody that
82:23 - you are you are ready you can bring
82:26 - value to their organization alright you
82:28 - can do good work and then if you if you
82:32 - can convince them and get the job then
82:34 - you are def right that's so there's no
82:39 - magic number right obviously more
82:41 - projects are going to see more
82:42 - impressive but that's also really kind
82:47 - of it depends like what kind of projects
82:50 - are they whether the quality of them the
82:52 - complexity so you can't really give a
82:57 - number
82:57 - that t0 t0 says does coding and being a
83:05 - programmer make you socially isolated
83:09 - actually not at all it's been the
83:11 - opposite for me hmm Wow
83:17 - so time I didn't have any G fuel today
83:19 - that's the problem let's blame it on
83:24 - that yeah so it's been the opposite for
83:31 - me I've actually through programming
83:33 - I've met people from all over the world
83:36 - and talked to them and I'd never be able
83:40 - to do that if I had I don't know let's
83:43 - say a different kind of job where I
83:46 - would just you know go into my normal
83:48 - work and I just interact with the people
83:51 - around me this has kind of opened things
83:53 - up to just so many more people right no
83:59 - not everybody's gonna have that right
84:01 - like I do the show
84:03 - I'm common somewhat active on Twitter
84:05 - and Instagram with other programmers I
84:07 - go to conferences so you kind of have to
84:10 - put in a little bit of effort so you can
84:13 - definitely do this job and be isolated
84:15 - right let's say you're a freelancer you
84:16 - don't work with anybody and you sit at
84:18 - your house yeah you could be isolated
84:20 - but it depends on how you want to you
84:22 - want to do it right so I think it's it's
84:27 - easier to be isolated in this job than
84:29 - in some other jobs but it doesn't have
84:31 - to be like that nobody says what if you
84:36 - change the structure like all the post
84:38 - type tabs horizontal after the search
84:41 - bar and also have all the post types
84:44 - search tabs user will manually search
84:48 - and it will reduce website bandwidth and
84:50 - I think it would quite fast but all the
84:53 - post types and the tabs you can add
84:55 - loading yeah you know beer that's
84:59 - actually that's not a bad idea I'm gonna
85:01 - think about that yeah I'll think about
85:05 - that
85:08 - Stephen says what's going on I sent you
85:11 - a paycheck created using some JavaScript
85:13 - to navigate floorplans models and pop up
85:15 - let me know what you think okay cool
85:17 - I'll check that out yeah thanks for for
85:19 - sending that over
85:35 - see Phoenix says today I made my first
85:39 - pull request on get up alright
85:41 - congratulations that's awesome let's see
85:48 - what was the what was the pull request
85:54 - okay I see farther down it's a design
85:58 - based pull request for the free code
86:00 - camp Top Contributors badge Oh awesome
86:07 - awesome awesome Oh way to sing it did I
86:11 - tell you all about the stickers that we
86:13 - have now let me show you okay so if you
86:22 - follow me on instagram you've probably
86:23 - seen this already but let's see if we
86:26 - can get this let me change the camera
86:28 - and show you this so Phoenix says design
86:33 - a sticker so we have this live coding
86:37 - with Jesse sticker now so I have like I
86:41 - think a hundred of them I mean - a
86:44 - couple that are on my laptop's but my
86:48 - stickers now so I'm not sure the best
86:51 - way to get these stickers out to people
86:53 - who want them I mean postage for these
86:57 - stickers will cost I mean just depends
86:59 - on where you're at I guess so I don't
87:01 - know I mean for sure like if anybody
87:04 - really wants one mailed to me and you
87:06 - like just send me you know a dollar or
87:09 - something for postage I can send one out
87:12 - I'll probably take them around with me
87:15 - wherever I go to conferences or meetups
87:16 - or anything - so if you all have any
87:20 - better ideas for what I should do with
87:22 - these stickers let me know
87:33 - see
87:50 - okay we got a question about the font
87:53 - it's um feet fiery font
87:56 - Fira
88:18 - and let's see a lien anonymous says I
88:22 - love the DMX and Phil Collins song but
88:24 - the original is good too oh wait I don't
88:27 - think I've ever heard that one how did I
88:29 - not hear about that I'll have to check
88:31 - that out
88:46 - haha Julia put my misspelling of
88:50 - displays so she she definitely caught me
88:52 - attempting to spelled this place with an
88:54 - IES at the end yeah spelling is not my
89:01 - strong suit like I definitely like I
89:03 - check everything that I put out there
89:06 - before I hit Send
89:08 - especially on tweets because my spelling
89:11 - is terrible I cashed his best language
89:17 - to learn for beginners alright so we
89:18 - actually had that question earlier on so
89:20 - I'm not going to go through a big thing
89:22 - about it but I personally recommend
89:23 - JavaScript if you want to know why watch
89:26 - the replay of this video and go back I
89:29 - don't know about a half hour before what
89:32 - I'm this point and I answer that kind of
89:36 - an in-depth work
89:39 - Omar asks where to learn react and
89:41 - master it you can start out with some of
89:44 - the free code camp stuff to learn react
89:46 - code Academy has a react course Udacity
89:51 - has a paid react course that's good so I
89:55 - would recommend those places if you can
89:58 - and then there's react training it's
90:03 - pretty good as well
90:04 - I've I've done like a little bit of
90:06 - their coursework I don't think I've ever
90:08 - gotten through an entire course not
90:10 - because it wasn't good just because I
90:11 - kind of got busy and forgot about it but
90:15 - those places are good also the react
90:16 - documentation is great so if you can
90:18 - check out the documentation and just
90:20 - read a little bit every day that would
90:22 - be good too and then work on projects
90:25 - that keep practicing and trying to do
90:27 - you know try to expand to do more things
90:29 - with reacts you know every every day if
90:31 - you can
90:33 - Roland said SVG is easy with Illustrator
90:36 - or Adobe XD
90:38 - I can do some if you've got some ideas
90:40 - on what you need okay I don't know I'll
90:44 - have to think about that I don't have
90:45 - any ideas right now but yeah let me
90:48 - think about it
90:54 - Julius says in response to where to
90:57 - learn reacted master at watch all his
90:59 - lashing videos haha yeah that's quite a
91:03 - lot let me think
91:05 - yes so did Project five itself now has
91:08 - ninety videos so and that's project five
91:12 - right so we've been through a lot this
91:13 - is definitely the longest project but I
91:16 - mean we've got to be approaching 200
91:18 - videos now right and each one of those
91:20 - is at least an hour long sometimes
91:22 - longer so I mean we're talking like
91:28 - maybe 300 hours of content I don't know
91:31 - maybe more it's a lot so anyway you
91:34 - don't definitely don't you will not be a
91:37 - master to react even if you do watch all
91:39 - my videos I don't I'm not a master
91:41 - myself but you may you may find
91:44 - something helpful
91:55 - oh okay Julie have some good advice
91:57 - about the we had a question earlier
91:59 - about what degrees should I get if I
92:01 - want to be a UX designer Julius's don't
92:04 - worry about the degree mentor under a UX
92:06 - designer that's a great idea
92:08 - I've been hearing more about this like
92:10 - idea of mentoring I think I listen to a
92:14 - podcast about this recently I can't
92:16 - remember which podcast it was the they
92:18 - sent this idea of the master and
92:20 - apprentice in InDesign in programming
92:24 - and I actually really like that ideas
92:27 - you know you have this kind of master
92:29 - apprentice and then it evolves into kind
92:31 - of like a mentor mentee relationship I
92:34 - think that's that's a great way to do it
92:36 - I kind of wish I've had various kind of
92:39 - like mentors before but never someone
92:41 - like that was clearly like I was
92:44 - apprentice to and I think that would
92:45 - have helped me to get better faster
92:48 - avoid a lot of mistakes so I I really
92:51 - like that idea
92:55 - shut chat Jana says hey hey how's it
92:59 - going sorry if I messed up your name
93:01 - please let me know let's see
93:07 - ambition says Monday and already waiting
93:09 - for Friday I don't know I mean I've been
93:12 - I haven't been doing that much work the
93:14 - last couple weeks because of my wrist
93:16 - thing so I'm ready to do some work I'm
93:19 - not ready for Friday yet Julius says for
93:26 - your next project you should create a
93:28 - forum for coders actually I'm another
93:34 - Julia I don't know if you saw anything
93:36 - about the JavaScript AF project so I
93:39 - bought the domain name JavaScript AF and
93:42 - yeah it's kind of a side project we've
93:45 - been working on it and one of the things
93:46 - that we want to have is something like a
93:48 - forum so we have we have some features
93:51 - already ready so I believe if you do go
93:54 - to JavaScript AF you can see it I'm
93:59 - gonna go to it on my my other screen
94:01 - here to see if it's up you know what
94:04 - it's not working right now
94:06 - I wonder if all right so we don't have
94:18 - it up right now
94:19 - too bad hearts just not watching but
94:22 - anyway we have project that's like kind
94:24 - of like that so we'll see I definitely
94:28 - need to do an update because we I
94:29 - haven't done an update on that project
94:31 - for a while aster says do you understand
94:41 - JavaScript closures call apply blind
94:44 - methods I can understand closures when I
94:49 - need to and I read about them but it's
94:52 - not like like if somebody asked me an
94:54 - interview question right now about it
94:56 - I'd probably be a mess right so yeah
95:01 - that's things like that
95:05 - usually I look at a lot of programming
95:07 - stuff like there are concepts in
95:10 - programming that you know you don't
95:13 - always you're not always able to just
95:15 - explain right but when you have to use
95:17 - them for project you can do them because
95:19 - you'll most likely look that look it up
95:22 - right there's so much that you don't
95:24 - just wing it you know you look it up
95:25 - first so sometimes I think like coding
95:30 - interviews are a bit I don't want to say
95:35 - unfair but it's just not realistic to be
95:40 - able to just rattle off like definitions
95:42 - of things like that because it's it's
95:43 - not what we do right we we get an idea
95:47 - and we make it happen by looking at
95:49 - what's already been done building on
95:51 - that and stuff so anyway if I were like
95:57 - going to go on an interview I'd probably
95:58 - be studying up on all that stuff so I
96:00 - would have answers cuz I mean that's
96:02 - just the way it works with interviews
96:04 - but yeah for now I have you asked me
96:09 - that question I'd look it up and I would
96:11 - say you know what I know exactly where
96:13 - to find the answer and you can find it
96:15 - here and that would that would really be
96:18 - my answer
96:19 - even if I was doing an interview right
96:20 - now that's what I would say Anna says I
96:26 - cloned the repository but don't know how
96:27 - to start it in the browser I used to
96:29 - work with create react app and NPM run
96:32 - only do I need to install web pack or
96:34 - something you should be able to run well
96:42 - make sure sorry if you've already done
96:44 - this I'm just I'm trying to go over the
96:46 - basics okay so I'm not assuming that you
96:48 - don't know this already but for anybody
96:50 - that wants to do the repo I believe
96:53 - there are some instructions in the
96:55 - readme or the contributing MD file but
96:57 - in case it doesn't cover this you know
96:59 - clone the repo locally maybe like if you
97:02 - want to fork it first and then clone it
97:04 - and then you want to do a you want to
97:08 - run yarn or an NPM install depending on
97:11 - which one you use make sure everything
97:14 - gets installed and then just start it up
97:16 - you want to run NPM run dev or yarn dev
97:20 - that's going to get everything started
97:22 - and then it should work from there so
97:26 - those steps should get you started if
97:28 - that's not working for you let me know
97:38 - see in walks a c-sharp developer or Jas
97:43 - developer I'm a JavaScript developer we
97:48 - have done a bit of c-sharp on this
97:50 - stream before because we were working
97:52 - with some legacy code but we don't
97:54 - really have to work with it anymore
97:57 - Julius says the mentor-mentee
97:59 - relationship is how I learned
98:00 - programming I dropped out of university
98:03 - yeah for sure
98:05 - I really think if somebody wants to be a
98:07 - programmer my take on it is you should
98:10 - only go to university if you have
98:15 - scholarships that are paying for it or
98:17 - let's say like your parents are going to
98:18 - pay for it otherwise it just doesn't
98:21 - make sense financially because it's
98:23 - unnecessary to get a job as a programmer
98:25 - you'll put yourself in a lot of debt
98:27 - basically for something that's not going
98:30 - to really give you a return right the
98:32 - amount you can make as a self-taught
98:34 - programmer versus the amount you can
98:36 - make as a programmer with the degree is
98:38 - not there's not that much difference
98:40 - right there potentially could be no
98:41 - difference at all right depending on how
98:44 - good you get in what your connections
98:45 - are so you know not only are you taking
98:49 - extra time in like four years or more
98:51 - but you're spending all this money and
98:54 - you're not gonna get a return so it's
98:56 - just it doesn't make sense financially
98:59 - right if we were analyzing this as like
99:02 - an investment opportunity it would make
99:05 - any sense right so it only makes sense
99:10 - really if you're getting your education
99:11 - paid for by somebody and then you know I
99:16 - think about going for it but only if I
99:17 - didn't already have to pay for stuff
99:19 - like you know if I already had a family
99:21 - or something I bills to pay like even if
99:23 - they're paying for my college I wouldn't
99:24 - do it right because I need to be able to
99:26 - make money I could learn the same a lot
99:28 - of the same stuff I've learned in
99:29 - college by actually doing projects and
99:31 - getting paid for it and learning while
99:32 - I'm doing so anyway and I work in
99:36 - universities so I mean I fully
99:38 - understand the benefits of a university
99:40 - but in this particular field it's it's
99:43 - just not necessary
99:51 - hey harsh sincere harsh it um I have a
99:55 - question do we have JavaScript AF
99:57 - running anywhere like the dead version
99:59 - of it I just tried to go to JavaScript
100:02 - AF in it it wasn't up and running so
100:06 - hello okay I see it's cut it's down
100:09 - because your card expired or something
100:10 - because it's needs a five dollar fee to
100:12 - be up where it is all right what account
100:15 - is that that we're running that on and
100:17 - it just if you want hard if you can
100:20 - DM me the info or something I'll get
100:22 - that up and running again
100:33 - let's see
100:36 - almost the end there live chat here so
100:38 - if you have any questions get them in
100:39 - now cuz we'll probably end pretty soon
100:41 - here are says by the way I'm on
100:47 - holiday just saw your story in Instagram
100:49 - and I had a look okay well enjoy enjoy
100:52 - your holiday are I don't want to
100:54 - don't worry about JavaScript AF I don't
100:56 - know what you have to do any work just
100:57 - enjoy your stuff and yeah have a good
101:03 - time also good to see you good to talk
101:05 - to you I haven't haven't talked to you
101:07 - for a while
101:16 - okay so and I just saw your message that
101:19 - you saw the yarn install your on dev
101:21 - thing okay cool yeah let me know how it
101:23 - goes and feel free to you know DM me on
101:27 - Twitter or Instagram or whatever to if
101:29 - if you have questions Renee says
101:35 - sometimes depending on where you live it
101:37 - may be required to have a degree you
101:38 - know that's a really good point that's a
101:40 - good point so I'm speaking generally
101:43 - from the perspective of somebody living
101:44 - in the United States so I don't know
101:47 - what the situation is in other countries
101:49 - so yeah so take what I'm saying and
101:53 - maybe just apply it to your situation
101:56 - right so I shouldn't make blanket
101:58 - statements like that your your country
102:01 - it may be different maybe a degree would
102:02 - be more important to trying to get in so
102:06 - here in the United States right now the
102:08 - way things are going you don't really
102:10 - need a degree but like I said if you can
102:14 - get a degree without going into a lot of
102:16 - debt it's it's not a bad idea right you
102:20 - never know how things are gonna be ten
102:22 - years from now right
102:25 - it's things could change right maybe
102:29 - people want a degree maybe you never
102:31 - know you never know what could happen so
102:32 - I just personally think in in the United
102:36 - States right now it costs so much money
102:40 - that it's just it's too much it's just
102:43 - too much debt
102:53 - my my young says I'm new here how's it
102:56 - going thanks thanks for watching we're
102:58 - kind of wrapping things up here but feel
102:59 - free to catch the recording and you ask
103:04 - any questions if you want phoenixes do
103:08 - you have any ideas for a Big Data
103:09 - project uh yeah actually I do have some
103:13 - ideas I'm just not sure where to get all
103:15 - the data I need but I have some ideas so
103:21 - yeah maybe we could talk about that
103:26 - though I Phoenix is I'm unable to decide
103:28 - on one I need to make one for my final
103:30 - year project I don't know if anybody has
103:32 - any ideas for Phoenix let us know
103:41 - oh okay Harsha's saying it's in the
103:44 - open-source plan but you still need $5
103:46 - to keep it up okay because we're using
103:48 - the custom URL right I'll do that you
103:51 - know what I I cancelled I dropped us
103:53 - down to a lower plan I think not
103:59 - realizing that it would totally shut it
104:01 - off
104:10 - as I said if you are 18 and thinking
104:13 - about what you are doing with your life
104:15 - in terms of employment what a I scare
104:17 - you
104:18 - me no I mean I'm not I'm not scared of a
104:25 - I'm really hopeful for the opportunities
104:27 - for a and I would be my outlook
104:30 - basically is like okay I may take over a
104:33 - lot of jobs but you still need somebody
104:36 - to make the AI right you need I mean
104:39 - there are a lot of people that are super
104:40 - hopeful about what AI can do but the
104:43 - terms of like the general artificial
104:44 - intelligence like based on what I've
104:47 - heard from people who are actually doing
104:49 - the work for AI not just like fans of AI
104:54 - we're not close to that we're nowhere
104:57 - near close to that so it's going to be a
105:01 - long time before we actually have like
105:02 - AI that doesn't need people involved at
105:04 - all so my my thought process would be
105:09 - okay well I'm not going to try to get
105:11 - one of those jobs that's likely to be
105:12 - taken over I want to be one of the
105:14 - people that's guiding it so and if I was
105:17 - eighteen that you know I'd be in shape
105:19 - to say alright I'm gonna try to get into
105:21 - like one of the top test tech schools
105:23 - like here in the United States maybe
105:24 - like Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh or
105:27 - maybe like MIT or something that's what
105:30 - I would shoot for I try to get in there
105:31 - and try to do a lot of work now that I'm
105:34 - married I have kids and stuff
105:35 - responsibilities I can't I can't do that
105:39 - right so I'm the one I'm doing I really
105:41 - like what I'm doing but yes if any of
105:45 - you are younger and they're thinking
105:46 - about it that's the route I would take
105:49 - and you know you you can make a huge
105:54 - impact on the world
105:55 - with that kind of stuff it's uber says
105:59 - what's the best books to learn design
106:01 - patterns oh man
106:03 - I I can't
106:08 - nothing's coming to mind right now like
106:09 - I vaguely remember there being something
106:12 - about design patterns some book but I
106:15 - can't remember it right now I'm sorry
106:21 - sam says react fibre what are your
106:24 - thoughts I think it's awesome I mean
106:26 - from what I've seen I don't know well
106:28 - like the technical stuff about it but
106:30 - it's it's gonna make things faster right
106:33 - and that's always good
106:43 - Harshit says still need to train models
106:45 - and tensorflow for the AI to work yeah
106:48 - you're right I mean I don't think people
106:50 - who don't like know about the process of
106:53 - how you get AI working don't realize how
106:55 - much human input is actually needed to
106:59 - guide this stuff right and and how
107:01 - narrow the field is right so I mean
107:05 - there's a lot of cool things AI can do
107:07 - but it's not at like the sci-fi movie
107:09 - level at all yet and it's in my mind
107:16 - like I'm not even sure we can get to
107:18 - that level realistically and if we can
107:20 - it's going to take a really long time
107:21 - like I'm not trying to be a pessimist or
107:24 - downer about it but just like based on
107:26 - what I know about the technology it's
107:29 - it's not it's not simple to get a
107:34 - general general artificial intelligence
107:36 - even from a hardware side of things like
107:39 - that much computing power it's going to
107:41 - be insane and then from a software like
107:43 - programming point there's it's also an
107:46 - immense amount of work that's going to
107:47 - happen have to happen in an immense
107:51 - amount of data that would be needed
108:00 - oh yeah that's right hard good so
108:04 - react fiber is already out it's in react
108:06 - sixteen so so react fiber is is there
108:16 - okay Laura said are you asking about
108:18 - suspense
108:19 - yes suspense is not out yet and it seems
108:22 - amazing
108:23 - check out damn it it's a Dan Abramov I
108:26 - think its DNA or most talk on react like
108:32 - suspense when did he give it it was this
108:36 - past year I can't remember what
108:38 - conference he gave it at but check it
108:42 - out it's amazing alright so that's the
108:47 - end of the chat and yeah we've been one
108:51 - almost two hours now so I think it's a
108:54 - good place to kind of wrap things up so
108:59 - thank you all so much for watching
109:00 - hopefully you found this useful thanks
109:05 - for all the interaction in the chat this
109:07 - is awesome
109:08 - and I'm gonna try to stream a little bit
109:12 - more oh good news I am I think I'm gonna
109:17 - be getting a new computer a new PC for
109:20 - free which I should be able to use to
109:24 - make it basically make it
109:27 - I can stream from home I don't know if
109:29 - y'all so the last time I tried to stream
109:30 - from home but the it was terrible like
109:32 - the quality was terrible so I think what
109:35 - I'm gonna be able to do is route the
109:37 - actual streaming through this PC to free
109:39 - up all the computing power on my macbook
109:41 - for just programming and I think that
109:44 - should solve the issue so once I get
109:46 - that computer in and I get it all
109:48 - configured I think I should be able to
109:51 - stream better streams from home and I'll
109:54 - be more consistent with it because right
109:55 - now it's like it's just really easy for
109:58 - me to say I don't feel like the one at
109:59 - today the quality is probably not gonna
110:00 - be good anyway and I don't write so I
110:03 - want to get back to streaming like more
110:05 - regularly
110:07 - so anyway that's coming I just don't
110:10 - know when I'm gonna get the laptop but
110:12 - hopefully sometime soon all right yeah
110:18 - so thank you all again and yeah so
110:23 - hopefully I can stream tomorrow but
110:25 - we'll see I'll be home tomorrow so so
110:28 - until next time have a great day
