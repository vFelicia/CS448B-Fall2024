00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to this video
00:01 - tutorial what i want to do is basically
00:04 - talk you through my
00:07 - rapid prototyping process within webflow
00:10 - um so
00:11 - what i'm going to do is just show you
00:13 - how i would take a
00:15 - concept in this case it's a concept for
00:17 - a dashboard
00:19 - um that i've just put together in
00:21 - balsamiq it's not a completely thought
00:23 - out concept or completely thought out
00:25 - product the idea is just to create a
00:27 - couple of screens so a kind of a
00:29 - dashboard screen and then kind of a
00:30 - secondary page and a login
00:33 - and then just show you
00:34 - my prototyping process of how i would
00:37 - get this into webflow
00:39 - um get it down as a wireframe and that's
00:42 - what we're going to look at in the first
00:43 - video and then the second video we're
00:45 - going to look at the
00:46 - how we could actually bring some
00:47 - interactivity um if we wanted to build
00:50 - out and make it into an interactive
00:51 - prototype as well
00:54 - and we're really just going to focus on
00:56 - things like the flows and
00:58 - communicating the concept um as a kind
01:01 - of an initial prototype that we may show
01:03 - our client or stakeholders
01:05 - all right so let's go ahead and jump
01:07 - into webflow
01:09 - um
01:11 - right so
01:13 - let's create a login page
01:16 - let's list out all our different pages
01:18 - first just so we know where we are in
01:19 - terms of structure and hierarchy
01:22 - so
01:23 - let's duplicate this
01:25 - and we are going to have a dashboard
01:27 - page freelancers and company page
01:31 - dashboard
01:37 - freelancers
01:44 - companies
01:48 - jobs reports and settings
01:51 - so i mean i'm thinking this is uh maybe
01:53 - i didn't explain it earlier but this is
01:54 - kind of it's it's like a freelance
01:56 - platform it's like you sign in
02:00 - you find jobs you connect with other
02:01 - freelancers you connect with other
02:03 - companies you pitch for jobs you earn
02:05 - money a little bit like something like
02:07 - upwork or something like that
02:09 - just a loose concept for a kind of
02:11 - a community of freelancers and a
02:13 - community of people that could work
02:15 - together
02:18 - [Music]
02:20 - okay so companies jobs reports and
02:22 - settings
02:27 - jobs
02:32 - reports
02:37 - settings
02:39 - we're not going to build out every
02:40 - single one of these pages we're just
02:41 - going to focus on a couple
02:43 - okay
02:44 - so let's grab a section
02:50 - sorry
02:53 - section
02:55 - um let's just call this because this is
02:57 - just how i approach things i'm going to
02:59 - call it section wide and that's like the
03:01 - widest part of the page
03:04 - um then within that i'm going to have
03:06 - a container that sits within that and
03:08 - i'm going to call it section inner
03:12 - and this is going to be like a central
03:14 - column our central container on the
03:15 - website and it's going to be everything
03:17 - that aligns it
03:18 - in the middle
03:20 - um
03:23 - right and let's bring a form into that
03:37 - okay um
03:39 - so let's bring our form into that but
03:41 - first what we want to do is set the
03:43 - width so we're going to say width 100
03:45 - which means that the container takes up
03:47 - the full width of its parent container
03:51 - but then we want to set a max width on
03:52 - it because
03:53 - its parent container currently takes up
03:55 - the full width of the screen and we
03:56 - don't want this central column to take
03:58 - up the full width of the screen
04:01 - let's say a max width of
04:04 - 1200 pixels
04:08 - and what that basically means is that
04:11 - if the parent container is over 1200
04:14 - pixels
04:15 - this
04:16 - central container will sit nicely in the
04:19 - middle of the screen
04:20 - and if it's less than it will scale to
04:22 - the full width of the device which is
04:24 - kind of how we want it to work
04:26 - um
04:28 - right
04:30 - let's call this login form
04:33 - again we're just going to move through
04:34 - quickly it's this is about prototyping
04:36 - stuff quickly getting ideas out down on
04:39 - the page and then bm to like present
04:40 - them to people and show them to people
04:43 - um
04:44 - but we also want this login form to not
04:46 - stretch this full width because it's
04:48 - quite long so let's set that to 500
04:50 - pixels
04:51 - and let's also center align that all
04:53 - right we are going to
04:58 - yeah login form but we want our login
05:00 - form to sit slap bang in the middle of
05:02 - the page
05:03 - so we're actually going to use flexbox
05:06 - and we're going to call this login form
05:09 - block
05:10 - all right
05:12 - i'll work that in there
05:14 - and the login form block we want to set
05:16 - the width 100
05:18 - the height
05:19 - 100 vh which is um
05:24 - full
05:25 - uh full height of the the parent
05:27 - container but then we want to bounce
05:29 - over and use flexbox so
05:34 - i'm gonna use flexbox and we're gonna
05:36 - say that the contents
05:39 - is
05:40 - horizontally and vertically aligned so
05:42 - we're saying
05:43 - login form block the contents
05:45 - horizontally and vertically aligned
05:47 - which means that this sits
05:49 - nicely in the center of the page
05:51 - so we've got a login form there we've
05:53 - got a login form block which we're
05:54 - applying the flexbox properties to
05:57 - um
05:58 - which allow it to sit in the middle of
06:00 - the page we've got that within a section
06:02 - inner
06:04 - which is keeping everything nicely
06:06 - centered in the page and then we've got
06:07 - it wrapped up in this section wide and
06:09 - and that might not be so obvious why we
06:10 - have a section wide
06:12 - here but further down the line what it
06:14 - allows you to do
06:16 - is manipulate the the full kind of
06:19 - background of the page so if you wanted
06:20 - to have like a full width and a full
06:22 - height background but then within that
06:24 - you wanted content that was center
06:26 - aligned and not full width at full
06:28 - height then
06:29 - it just gives you more options to kind
06:30 - of manipulate it but we don't want to
06:32 - worry too much about that in a minute
06:34 - because we just want to build out like a
06:35 - a quick kind of prototype
06:38 - so let's actually just get rid of that
06:40 - um next thing we want to do is
06:45 - add a little bit of a header so we just
06:46 - want to add like a top navigation
06:49 - uh
06:51 - strip and we just want to add like a
06:52 - potential logo
06:55 - so notice as well because we're
06:57 - prototyping we're not styling anything
06:59 - we're just keeping everything default we
07:00 - want to keep things in aerial
07:02 - because it's nice and boring it's nice
07:04 - and plain and the point is not to
07:06 - actually approach the design at the
07:08 - minute it's just to think purely about
07:10 - content
07:12 - layouts
07:13 - content structure and hierarchy you know
07:16 - the user flows
07:17 - um and different things like that and
07:19 - and when we're presenting a prototype we
07:21 - just want people to be able to
07:23 - use it and experience it and move
07:25 - through it
07:26 - and
07:27 - analyze it from that perspective rather
07:29 - than focusing too much on how the design
07:31 - works but what we do want to do is
07:34 - because it's web flow because it's a
07:36 - form this is the first page they land on
07:39 - we want to
07:41 - redirect them to a particular page so
07:43 - i'm actually going to just use a little
07:44 - hack here and rather than having a form
07:46 - button i'm just going to have a normal
07:48 - button
07:50 - and we're going to call this
07:52 - so let's just make this consistent with
07:53 - the wireframe so we've got
07:56 - email
07:58 - password
08:02 - and then we can change our placeholder
08:04 - text so it's just
08:07 - your name it's a bit more succinct
08:10 - your email
08:13 - um
08:16 - so let's say that these are required
08:17 - because when we demo it to someone or
08:19 - when we test on it we can actually get
08:21 - people to input their details and it
08:23 - feels a bit more like the real product
08:25 - um
08:26 - let's change the button text here
08:29 - to
08:31 - log in
08:34 - all right cool
08:36 - um
08:37 - yeah so sorry going back to the button
08:39 - so let's use this to redirect to our
08:42 - first page so then that creates the
08:43 - impression that you land on the login
08:45 - screen
08:46 - uh you enter your details you click to
08:47 - log in and it takes you to our first
08:49 - page so it would be something like this
08:54 - um
08:58 - login
09:00 - so
09:02 - let's make that required
09:11 - cool and then let's redirect the
09:13 - dashboard
09:16 - site email rob
09:21 - password
09:24 - whatever
09:25 - click login and then it goes to our
09:27 - dashboard so that's kind of emulating
09:29 - that user flow which is quite nice
09:32 - um
09:33 - the other thing we want to do is add in
09:35 - a header here
09:37 - so let's call this
09:40 - uh
09:42 - that's been the middle as well
09:45 - let's call this login
09:48 - login block header to know what's going
09:52 - on there
09:56 - header
09:58 - let's call this login
10:00 - all right
10:01 - let's add a little kind of margin to
10:02 - that oh not that much
10:08 - something like that maybe that's too
10:09 - much
10:11 - login
10:15 - cool
10:16 - okay
10:18 - um
10:18 - [Music]
10:21 - you know what as well let's like
10:23 - let's give this a little bit of interest
10:25 - so let's make this gray
10:29 - and then what we're going to do is break
10:30 - this out on a box
10:32 - so we're going to have a login form
10:34 - i'm going to have that a nice white
10:35 - background
10:41 - and we're going to add a bit of padding
10:43 - so we're going to say
10:45 - 40 pixels
10:47 - might be a bit too much
10:51 - i think that's cool but we've just got a
10:53 - bit too much there because this has got
10:54 - padding on it there we go so it's like a
10:56 - login
10:58 - box and a login screen for the first
11:00 - screen of the prototype and we want to
11:02 - add in a header here
11:04 - so
11:05 - let's grab a div
11:08 - and let's say uh
11:13 - a header wide
11:15 - all right
11:18 - let's give that a background color as
11:19 - well
11:21 - okay let's set that at width
11:23 - width 100 it's it's already like 100
11:27 - anyway in a sense
11:29 - um
11:30 - now let's give that an inner container
11:32 - so we can centralize the contents
11:35 - let's call this
11:37 - header inner
11:40 - with 100
11:42 - max 1200 pixels and again because we
11:44 - want to central uh centralize it i'm
11:47 - gonna use auto
11:49 - um now that's disappeared because
11:52 - because there's no contents what it's
11:53 - automatically going to do is just fold
11:55 - up to nothing
11:57 - because it the height of it expands to
11:59 - fill the contents because there is no
12:00 - contents it goes to nothing just so we
12:03 - can see it we're going to give it the
12:04 - height 50 pixels
12:08 - but actually what we want to do is
12:11 - because of the nature of this dashboard
12:13 - we don't really want this header center
12:15 - aligned
12:17 - um
12:19 - so we're actually just going to
12:21 - call this logo block
12:25 - i'm going to say width 200 pixels
12:28 - 150 this is literally this is the
12:31 - placeholder for a logo
12:33 - okay
12:36 - and again this is this is the thing with
12:37 - wireframes it's just well and prototypes
12:40 - is it's just all about blocks it's
12:42 - thinking in terms of blocks
12:44 - it's not going into too much detail
12:46 - it's just you know
12:48 - bringing stuff together on the page this
12:50 - goes here this goes there call done
12:52 - let's move on to the next page you know
12:54 - just that very kind of quick successive
12:56 - way
12:57 - of um of prototyping things and bringing
13:00 - things together
13:01 - you know
13:02 - think about the detail and everything
13:03 - like that the the kind of more refined
13:06 - ui stage
13:08 - um
13:09 - header wide so what we want is a bit of
13:10 - padding because
13:12 - we don't want this logo to sit right up
13:15 - against the header there
13:19 - um
13:23 - okay so let's start looking at the uh
13:26 - the main dashboard page
13:28 - and i'm bringing this into
13:30 - a wireframe so we've got a sort of a
13:33 - type a heading of the page we've got a
13:35 - header at the top
13:37 - we've got some kind of uh figures that
13:38 - we've pulled out these could be nicely
13:40 - animated or have ads then some kind of
13:43 - visual interest of the page
13:45 - and we've got a list of new jobs within
13:47 - the platform and new freelancers that
13:49 - have joined the platform as well
13:51 - so let's look at how we can build that
13:53 - out so this is an interesting kind of
13:55 - design challenge here
13:57 - uh we want to kind of create this
13:58 - sidebar that sticks to the left of the
14:00 - page we want to create this header as
14:02 - well and then we want to also
14:04 - keep all of this stuff in the center of
14:06 - the page too so
14:07 - let's have a think about how we could do
14:09 - that
14:10 - i've done this before on a couple of
14:11 - projects so we are going to grab our
14:15 - header
14:17 - hit a wide
14:18 - i'm going to dump this into here
14:21 - um
14:23 - let's also grab
14:25 - a
14:27 - section
14:35 - this section wide so this is the thing
14:37 - it's about kind of creating reusable
14:39 - elements
14:41 - um
14:42 - you know so your section wide is
14:44 - consistent it's always got a gray
14:45 - background it's always the full width
14:47 - page and you know that you can build on
14:49 - that as like a canvas
14:51 - with the rest of your content
14:53 - um
14:55 - section inner
14:57 - so let's not worry about that for the
14:59 - minute so we've got a section wide
15:03 - uh
15:04 - what we also want to do
15:06 - is yeah what's going on there
15:19 - i don't know why that's happening
15:22 - oh i know why because all right cool um
15:26 - [Music]
15:28 - okay so
15:30 - let's don't worry about that for a
15:32 - minute what we want to do is we want to
15:34 - kind of we want to figure out how we can
15:36 - build this uh nav bar on the left
15:39 - and then this content section on the
15:40 - right so what we're going to do is we're
15:42 - going to create a container
15:44 - we're going to fix it to the left
15:48 - um
15:49 - then we're going to create a wider
15:50 - container and i'm going to move the
15:52 - contents of that over to the right
15:55 - so it misses
15:56 - the sidebar on the left and brings it
15:58 - into the middle of the screen and
16:00 - that probably didn't make much sense but
16:01 - i'll show you what we're going to do
16:03 - so
16:05 - section wide so
16:07 - let's call this section left
16:11 - right
16:13 - i'm going to call this next bit section
16:16 - right
16:20 - all right
16:24 - now we're going to say section left
16:25 - height 100
16:29 - let's give it a fixed width right
16:30 - because we want it to be fixed so if we
16:33 - have like 200 pixels
16:36 - um
16:39 - let's give it a background
16:42 - can't see anything at the minute
16:45 - in fact let's give it an absolute height
16:47 - just so we can be sure of where it is
16:49 - okay
16:51 - so section left
16:53 - and let's fix that
16:56 - so it's
16:58 - um
17:00 - absolute
17:03 - all right
17:13 - let's get section right
17:18 - and
17:24 - okay just so you can see what i'm doing
17:26 - i'm gonna do section left is gonna be
17:29 - like a red color
17:31 - all right section right
17:37 - let's make that blue
17:40 - i'm just going to give it a height 500
17:42 - pixels as well
17:45 - um
17:49 - then what we want to happen is
17:58 - we don't want that to be auto
18:01 - we can fix that on the landing page
18:04 - um
18:05 - so we you kind of see here we've got you
18:07 - know we've got our header we've got this
18:09 - sidebar
18:11 - and we've got this
18:13 - section right
18:15 - but then what we want to do is we want
18:17 - to have an inner section in this section
18:20 - right so we can actually put some
18:22 - content in it
18:25 - so i want to call that section
18:27 - in a right and what we want to do then
18:30 - is we want to offset that by the width
18:32 - of this on the left
18:34 - so this is 200 pixels right so let's get
18:37 - that
18:39 - and let's bring a margin
18:43 - of let's say 240 pixels right
18:47 - there you go
18:50 - um
18:54 - right and if i
18:56 - set that to 100 vh
18:59 - if i set that to 100
19:04 - it's going to go to there
19:07 - and set that to 100 as well
19:09 - i can i might have to tweak this in a
19:11 - bit because i don't know if these
19:12 - percentages are going to work properly
19:14 - but do you see how this is coming
19:15 - together so section left
19:18 - let's turn that into
19:20 - something that's maybe a bit
19:22 - darker and section right let's get rid
19:26 - of that
19:29 - so you see
19:30 - so now we have
19:34 - like the makings of a dashboard so
19:36 - column on the left heading at the top
19:39 - and content area on the right
19:45 - let's lighten this up a little bit
19:50 - again when you're making prototypes so
19:52 - we're going to be grayscale but
19:54 - you want to think about the different
19:55 - levels um
19:58 - of the content so stuff that's at the
20:00 - background
20:02 - you know if you want to make that
20:05 - go to the background
20:06 - yeah it should be kind of lighter it
20:08 - should be less heavy if you want to
20:10 - bring stuff to the foreground
20:11 - make it darker make it more heavy you
20:14 - know and think about it it's really
20:16 - you know it's 50 shades of grey
20:18 - basically
20:21 - um
20:24 - okay so what we want to do now is just
20:26 - quickly build out our um
20:29 - like a list so we're going to call this
20:32 - sidebar
20:34 - nav list
20:36 - right
20:38 - no bullets
20:41 - i'm going to call this sidebar list
20:45 - item
20:50 - okay
20:51 - and we're going to add some
20:53 - what we want to do is we want to make
20:55 - these like buttons right so let's add
20:57 - some link blocks in there
20:59 - so that means the whole the whole thing
21:02 - is going to be clickable so let's say
21:04 - sidebar link block
21:08 - i'll show you how that's going to work
21:14 - right
21:15 - um
21:16 - and then we want to add some text
21:19 - so
21:21 - let's call this
21:23 - uh
21:24 - sidebar
21:25 - text link
21:29 - let's call this dashboard
21:31 - so let's get all our content in then we
21:32 - can style it up really easily in webflow
21:35 - uh so we want dashboard freelancers
21:37 - companies and jobs
21:40 - so one two three
21:43 - dashboard
21:45 - freelancers
21:48 - companies
21:51 - dashboard freelancers companies
21:55 - jobs reports and settings
22:07 - settings cool
22:09 - so
22:13 - let's give
22:16 - um
22:20 - let's just make this the full width
22:23 - so we're kind of making these into big
22:24 - clickable blocks so let's give that full
22:27 - width let's add some padding
22:30 - we've got some padding between them all
22:35 - right
22:39 - then let's add like a border like a
22:41 - divider just to show that they're
22:43 - separate blocks
22:45 - let's make that a bit more subtle
22:47 - something like that
22:49 - um
22:51 - and then let's get rid of no let's keep
22:53 - i mean this is a prototype so let's keep
22:55 - these underlined we want to show that
22:56 - they're links
22:58 - um but what it means is
23:00 - that we've now got sort of clickable
23:02 - buttons here
23:05 - um so if i click on each of those i
23:06 - would go to the relevant page
23:09 - which is pretty cool
23:10 - um
23:11 - now what we might do just to show that
23:14 - this is a selected state
23:16 - um is webflow has a like a current link
23:22 - which should
23:24 - should allow me to
23:26 - say that the link of the page that i'm
23:28 - selected on appears differently
23:32 - but i'm not seeing that
23:35 - i think it's because i'm not
23:37 - yeah so i'm not actually linking up
23:40 - so let's link these up so we want to go
23:43 - freelancers
23:46 - to say i'm not building out every page
23:49 - but i'm just showing you how to like
23:50 - rapidly create a simple prototype
23:54 - you know using this approach in webflow
24:02 - freelancers dashboard
24:05 - so yeah you see there it says current so
24:07 - this then says that the current page
24:09 - we're actually able to style it so that
24:12 - what's currently selected can appear a
24:13 - bit differently so
24:14 - let's just say
24:17 - let's have that
24:18 - appear a bit darker
24:20 - and
24:22 - i think we could change the text color
24:24 - as well
24:32 - let's just leave that you know
24:34 - that's fine it just shows us we're on
24:36 - that page
24:38 - so there we go if we click on that
24:40 - well we don't have the navigation on
24:42 - that page but you'll see it if we did
24:47 - okay cool so we're getting there so
24:49 - we've got a navigation made
24:51 - um let's look at our top level
24:53 - navigation so we just want to bring in
24:55 - this kind of it's like a drop down
24:58 - normally on a dashboard you have a link
24:59 - in the top right that lets you access
25:01 - things like your account and your
25:02 - settings and it's like kind of a my
25:04 - profile link so we can just add that in
25:08 - really easily
25:11 - this is already
25:12 - floated so we want to float this to the
25:14 - left this logo
25:17 - and then we just want to use like a
25:18 - simple drop down
25:20 - um
25:21 - like a select
25:23 - but that actually has to be in a form
25:25 - which is
25:26 - fine so let's use this drop down this
25:29 - one's pretty cool right so that's the
25:32 - standard kind of webflow drop down so
25:34 - let's call it profile
25:36 - drop down
25:40 - and let's give it a bit of a border so
25:43 - it kind of stands off the white
25:44 - background
25:45 - and let's call this
25:47 - normally on the dashboard you kind of
25:49 - have like you have the person's name if
25:52 - you're logged in and then you'd maybe
25:53 - have a little picture of them then you
25:55 - could access different elements from
25:57 - that drop down so let's just let's give
25:59 - it my name
26:01 - um
26:03 - and let's float this to the right
26:07 - okay we've got our padding here so it
26:09 - doesn't
26:11 - sit right in the right
26:12 - right right
26:15 - let's just publish that
26:22 - okay cool
26:25 - and then we can
26:26 - you know we can access other parts of
26:28 - the prototype um
26:30 - using those potential links
26:33 - so i don't know why this is red now
26:39 - that's because it's gone red for some
26:40 - weird reason
26:42 - um so let's just add in a couple of
26:43 - other options there so if we go to the
26:45 - drop down list and we show that we can
26:48 - then actually choose the options here so
26:49 - we could have
26:50 - my account
26:53 - settings
26:55 - and again if you're building out you
26:56 - know the whole prototype then you could
26:58 - link this up
27:00 - off to all the other individual parts of
27:02 - the the dashboard and the prototype
27:05 - you can do a lot with it
27:06 - but just for the purposes of this video
27:08 - we're just gonna kind of we're not gonna
27:10 - actually link all that up today
27:12 - so we've got this um we've got a sort of
27:14 - a page title
27:16 - and then we've got this content here
27:17 - that we're gonna add in so
27:20 - let's go to our section
27:22 - in a right
27:23 - and what we want to do is add in a
27:25 - heading and we're going to make this an
27:27 - h1 because it's the main heading of the
27:29 - page so i'm going to call this like
27:30 - dashboard h1
27:34 - um
27:35 - let's make it 32
27:39 - let's call this overview
27:42 - as per the wireframe there
27:45 - and let's add a bit of padding to this
27:46 - main kind of inner section so this is
27:49 - section in the right is this kind of
27:51 - centralized um column
27:54 - that sits on the right hand side of the
27:55 - dashboard uh sorry on the um navigation
27:59 - i'm just going to add some padding in
28:00 - there so let's add in
28:02 - selling about 20 pixels padding
28:05 - and there's definitely going to be a few
28:06 - things that we can we need to kind of
28:08 - like tweak
28:09 - tweak and just kind of smooth over
28:13 - with the prototype and definitely with
28:14 - the responsive stuff we can look at that
28:16 - too but we're just going to focus at
28:17 - kind of getting the content in it and
28:19 - just kind of getting something together
28:21 - tangible for the minute
28:23 - um so we've got these three boxes which
28:25 - are kind of like call out boxes they're
28:27 - they're sort of notifications telling
28:29 - the user
28:30 - how much they've earned how many new
28:32 - jobs are within the platform and how
28:33 - many new freelancers have joined the
28:35 - platform
28:36 - so to do that we're going to
28:39 - choose a
28:41 - some columns
28:43 - i'm gonna call this three col row
28:49 - um
28:50 - then we're gonna choose how many columns
28:52 - we're gonna have so we're gonna have
28:53 - three
28:55 - and then just so we can kind of um
28:58 - apply some styling to the individual
29:00 - columns if you wanted to something i
29:02 - always do i just i kind of give them
29:04 - individual classes so call one cool
29:07 - three
29:08 - and we want to actually bring that in
29:11 - to that central container there
29:15 - um okay so
29:18 - let's call this
29:21 - info box
29:27 - um
29:28 - and this little thing here is going to
29:30 - be like an icon or
29:32 - some sort of image or some sort of
29:34 - illustration that just goes with the the
29:36 - data um but again it's it's a prototype
29:41 - so we're just going to keep this um
29:44 - you know keep it simple keep it blocky
29:49 - let's just give that a fixed width and a
29:51 - fixed height
29:53 - so let's give our info box a background
29:56 - color
30:03 - let's make it something like that
30:08 - let's give this some padding
30:10 - so it's not all so close to the edges
30:16 - 20 20 20.
30:18 - i'm kind of just working multiples of
30:20 - 20. um
30:22 - sometimes i like to do things
30:25 - um
30:26 - there's no hard and fast rule around
30:28 - that
30:29 - i just i like to keep things consistent
30:31 - and say you know let's work in multiples
30:33 - of 20 or 30 or whatever
30:37 - um we think it's best for the project
30:41 - okay so
30:44 - so it doesn't actually need to be a
30:45 - heading so let's call this let's get a
30:47 - text block
30:49 - let's call that
30:50 - um
30:53 - info number
30:55 - large
30:57 - again just thinking of things quickly
31:00 - getting the content in you know
31:02 - it's it's a kind of an early stage
31:03 - prototype
31:05 - it doesn't you don't need to spend ages
31:08 - thinking about things
31:12 - um
31:13 - let's make this bigger give it a bit of
31:16 - impact let me make it bold as well
31:21 - let's make it bold
31:23 - so what we want to do is so you want
31:26 - okay so we've got that and we want to
31:28 - give this a little bit of text as well
31:31 - so let's call this info
31:34 - detail right
31:36 - this month
31:41 - okay so what we want to do now is bring
31:43 - this figure and this little piece of
31:45 - text
31:46 - kind of in line with the icon um so if
31:49 - we floated this to the left
31:52 - we floated that to the left
31:56 - and then we floated that to the left it
31:58 - doesn't really work so
32:02 - what we
32:06 - what we kind of want to do i think is
32:08 - put them in
32:10 - uh we want to put them in separate
32:12 - containers
32:15 - i think that's the best way to do it so
32:17 - let's call this info
32:20 - block left
32:29 - okay i'm going to put the icon in there
32:31 - and it's an info block left
32:33 - it's 50 pixels and we're going to keep
32:35 - the height
32:36 - standard
32:38 - sorry
32:39 - auto um
32:43 - let's call this info
32:44 - block right
32:46 - so then this is going to be the
32:49 - the the
32:50 - the opposite container that we're going
32:52 - to float right
32:54 - so let's add that into there
32:58 - there
33:00 - or even yeah we're actually going to
33:02 - float it left
33:03 - so
33:05 - info block left let's flight that left
33:08 - let's not float this so that this now
33:11 - breaks out onto there
33:13 - so that's not floated
33:16 - this also isn't floated but we want to
33:19 - float the wrapper to the left
33:22 - perfect now let's add some
33:26 - bit of margin to the bottom there
33:31 - and then let's also add a bit of
33:34 - margin here
33:36 - cool okay so that is
33:42 - a bit of line height there
33:45 - okay cool
33:47 - maybe we can just
33:49 - i don't know could that be a little icon
33:51 - like a circle or something
33:54 - um
34:02 - let's make it like a little
34:05 - just so it's circle
34:05 - bit more interesting
34:07 - that's pretty much it
34:09 - um
34:11 - yeah cool so we've got
34:13 - so let's just copy and paste that and
34:15 - let's just change the content
34:18 - we've got a 57
34:20 - new jobs
34:23 - 18
34:27 - new freelancers
34:31 - and this this central column is
34:32 - obviously really wide and we're going to
34:34 - sort this out
34:37 - shortly
34:39 - so it's kind of um
34:43 - stretching the whole width but we can
34:45 - sort that out so look we've got our flow
34:47 - kind of set up log in
34:49 - let's enter our details
34:54 - okay password
34:56 - something
34:57 - login bang we're into our dashboard
35:02 - we haven't got the other pages set up
35:04 - yet
35:05 - now let's work on these two columns here
35:08 - so same thing again
35:11 - let's um
35:14 - let's use two uh two column layout and
35:17 - let's call this two call right
35:20 - um
35:23 - two columns let's drag this down
35:27 - let's just call this call left
35:33 - call right
35:34 - again
35:36 - don't necessarily have to give these
35:37 - classes but i just it's like a habit
35:40 - just if we wanted to
35:41 - style one of these columns
35:44 - specifically then we we can do that
35:48 - so let's call this
35:51 - new job block
35:58 - let's add a bit of padding as well for
36:00 - here
36:01 - um
36:03 - but also
36:08 - yeah so we we don't
36:11 - you know we might use three column row
36:13 - again
36:14 - that's like a reusable element so
36:17 - we don't want to necessarily add a
36:18 - margin to the bottom of that because if
36:20 - we're using it elsewhere
36:22 - it might affect that layout so let's
36:23 - give this so let's wrap that in
36:25 - something and then let's refer to that
36:27 - thing that we've wrapped in specifically
36:29 - so
36:30 - let's call this um
36:33 - info block
36:36 - wrapper okay
36:38 - and we can add a margin to the bottom of
36:40 - that
36:45 - and then for this
36:47 - let's call it
36:49 - um
36:57 - let's call this a new
37:01 - new info block
37:07 - let's call it notification block
37:16 - cool
37:17 - right new job block
37:19 - let's give this background color because
37:21 - again we
37:22 - want it to be like a kind of a block or
37:24 - a card that's sitting on the page
37:27 - let's also give this a bit of padding
37:33 - and the other thing was in webflow
37:39 - by default the columns have
37:42 - like they have their own
37:44 - kind of padding within them
37:47 - so they have a padding of 10 pixels left
37:50 - and right and what that means is you can
37:52 - kind of get this thing where it doesn't
37:53 - really
37:54 - match up with the with the border of the
37:56 - parent container
37:58 - so what i often do is just i whack a
38:01 - minus on there so i say -10
38:04 - minus 10 and that kind of balances stuff
38:06 - out
38:14 - cool
38:15 - okay
38:16 - so let's
38:19 - let's have a heading here and let's have
38:21 - this as a heading 2 right
38:23 - let's say dashboard
38:25 - heading 2
38:27 - or dashboard h2
38:31 - um and let's think about hierarchy so
38:34 - maybe that could be a bit bigger maybe
38:36 - that's 48.
38:37 - let's bring this down to something like
38:39 - 32. there's a bit more of a contrast in
38:42 - the hierarchy there
38:44 - we've got new jobs
38:47 - let's give this card
38:49 - some
38:51 - some padding
39:00 - cool let's just take the margin off of
39:02 - that
39:03 - and then we want to create these kind of
39:04 - list items so we can do that pretty
39:06 - easily using the list element
39:09 - um let's grab a list
39:11 - and let's just call it new job list
39:14 - list
39:15 - let's grab a list item let's call it new
39:18 - job
39:19 - item
39:27 - again you know moving quickly not
39:30 - not thinking too much about stuff just
39:32 - sort of getting getting the idea down
39:35 - and and getting something tangible
39:37 - down and again we've got the same thing
39:38 - here you know we want an image on the
39:40 - left and then we want to float this text
39:41 - to the right so
39:43 - let's do the same thing that we did
39:46 - above
39:49 - let's call this
39:50 - new
39:51 - job
39:52 - left
39:55 - let's duplicate that
39:59 - new job right
40:02 - let's see how this will work
40:05 - let's just put that in there we can
40:07 - rename it let's call this new job icon
40:11 - maybe this could be
40:13 - like if it was a job from a company it
40:15 - could be a logo or it could be an image
40:17 - or you know it could even just be a sort
40:19 - of a generic platform icon depending on
40:22 - the
40:23 - the um
40:26 -  depending on the
40:28 - um
40:30 - context
40:31 - so what's this
40:33 - job left cool
40:36 - just get rid of that and call a new job
40:38 - icon
40:43 - okay let's do 50 50 with that
40:49 - so let's have a similar kind of gray
40:55 - um
40:57 - what do we want to do
41:00 - and that's in new job left so let's
41:03 - flight that to the left
41:05 - new job
41:07 - right let's add some text in
41:11 - so let's call this new job
41:13 - new
41:14 - job title
41:18 - let's make it aerial bold
41:23 - again i i think i said this earlier but
41:25 - keep you know if you're making a
41:27 - prototype keep your text simple don't
41:29 - worry about fancy fonts or anything like
41:30 - that
41:32 - just keep it simple keep it readable use
41:34 - ariel
41:36 - it's a bit boring but that's kind of the
41:37 - point
41:41 - um
41:43 - right so let's float this to the right
41:49 - cool and then let's add a little margin
41:52 - on the left so it pushes that
41:54 - right container away
41:57 - then we want to add a little description
42:06 - uh let's grab some text
42:08 - and let's call this new
42:11 - job
42:12 - description
42:15 - um
42:24 - lovely stuff
42:27 - all right cool
42:28 - um and then the other thing we want to
42:30 - do so new job item let's get rid of
42:32 - these list items and we can just
42:33 - duplicate this one
42:35 - let's just add a
42:36 - a margin sorry a divider to the bottom
42:39 - there so we know that it's something and
42:41 - let's also
42:43 - let's add
42:47 - add a bit of
42:49 - padding
42:50 - margin there
42:51 - and then let's push this away as well so
42:54 - let's um let's put a kind of a bottom
42:56 - margin on that you see
43:00 - and then if we yeah if we wanted to
43:08 - okay
43:14 - let's say
43:16 - let's have six
43:21 - and then
43:23 - actually sorry instead of doing that
43:25 - let's add some padding
43:27 - so the new job list item
43:29 - has padding 20 pixels at the bottom on
43:32 - the top
43:33 - there you go
43:35 - and we what we could also do
43:37 - what we could also do is um
43:41 - maybe we could add like a divider to
43:44 - that but it's probably not necessary
43:48 - okay cool this is coming together
43:54 - um
44:00 - right and then we kind of just want to
44:02 - we kind of just want to repeat the same
44:04 - thing here
44:07 - so it's sort of making me think do we
44:09 - need to
44:12 - do we need to kind of
44:14 - rename all these classes
44:17 - um
44:21 - like like what i'm trying to say is do
44:22 - we need to have
44:24 - a block for new jobs in a block for new
44:27 - freelancers or can we just use the same
44:29 - kind of classes for that and just be a
44:31 - bit more generic and
44:32 - i think we can and i think what we can
44:34 - do is we could say look we can use the
44:36 - rename function
44:39 - and we can say
44:40 - new job
44:42 - new item block right
44:45 - it's more of a generic item block
44:48 - dashboard h2 is fine
44:50 - let's call this rename let's call this
44:53 - new item title
44:55 - right so it's just a bit more generic in
44:58 - the way that we're referring to it
45:02 - but it means that we don't have to
45:05 - like re
45:07 - like we don't have to create another
45:08 - kind of element and give it give it a
45:10 - load of new classes or anything like
45:12 - that
45:16 - um you item
45:20 - description
45:24 - new item icon
45:26 - right
45:27 - because it's all the same thing right
45:29 - it's just new items on the home page so
45:32 - let's grab this let's put it in this
45:34 - column
45:35 - let's just change this title
45:38 - okay
45:44 - um and there we pretty much have it
45:51 - this is kind of cool
45:55 - right obviously again this is going off
45:57 - the edge of the page we can sort that
45:59 - out but as you can see
46:02 - you know the prototype is coming
46:04 - together
46:07 - um
46:10 - actually what we also might want to do
46:13 - and we're not going to
46:14 - go there just in the minute
46:17 - but what we also
46:19 - might want to do is make this whole
46:21 - block
46:23 - like clickable
46:25 - so if we wanted to link through from
46:29 - the
46:31 - from this list to to the actual
46:33 - item that we're talking about then we
46:35 - could do that
46:37 - all right so one two three four five six
46:42 - and then we could say
46:44 - if we actually had like a
46:47 - a page
46:49 - that had the job the job on it then we
46:51 - could link to that
46:53 - but um we're not we're not there just at
46:55 - the minute
46:57 - okay
46:58 - and then maybe we don't want this to all
47:00 - be in blue because it's not like a
47:01 - primary link
47:03 - so we want to just kind of change our
47:05 - text color a little bit there
47:07 - um
47:12 - but sorry i'm going around in circles
47:13 - here we need to give the link class to
47:16 - be able to do that
47:19 - okay
47:28 - where are we
47:29 - um
47:32 - item let's call it item link
47:35 - okay so it's got a class that means
47:38 - every other class of item link will be
47:40 - styled this way
47:45 - oh where is it
47:49 - okay new job item
47:51 - okay cool
47:52 - new job list
48:00 - okay i don't know what happened there i
48:02 - thought i renamed that
48:05 - item list
48:09 - let's just call it new item right
48:16 - spell it right
48:20 - okay so new item one two three four six
48:24 - cool new item block let's put it in
48:26 - there again
48:28 - change it
48:32 - let's just add in a name let's just say
48:34 - freelancer name right
48:42 - it's probably the long way of doing it
48:44 - but it
48:46 - sorry i'm supposed to swear
48:51 - job title okay
48:54 - now it's always better to use
48:57 - uh you know i'm sending a bad example
48:59 - here it's always way better to use real
49:01 - content in a wireframe or a prototype
49:03 - because then you're actually you're
49:05 - designing for the content you have
49:08 - um but i am just kind of using these
49:11 - generic
49:12 - names for the purpose of this prototype
49:19 - okay so new jobs new freelancers
49:22 - and if you want we can click and then
49:23 - that would go to the actual single page
49:26 - if we had that set up
49:28 - we don't have that in a minute so that's
49:30 - that's basically the homepage so or the
49:32 - dashboard rather so we've got
49:35 - we've got our overview we've got our
49:37 - figures these could be you know some
49:40 - interesting figures
49:41 - that counted up when you first landed on
49:43 - the page uh just to provide like a bit
49:46 - of visual interest or we could have like
49:47 - some charts or graphs or something like
49:49 - that there
49:51 - we've just got a list of new jobs within
49:53 - the platform and new freelancers and you
49:55 - could click on one of these and that
49:56 - would take you through to the specific
49:58 - page for that item that you clicked on
50:01 - um and we've also kind of got this this
50:03 - drop down and this is what i like about
50:04 - webflow compared to
50:07 - like prototyping in static software you
50:11 - know like sketch or something
50:13 - there's a lot you can do with sketch but
50:16 - you know to just get something like in
50:18 - the browser
50:20 - you know get it kind of responding and
50:22 - being able to interact with it and
50:24 - create these kind of actual interactions
50:26 - and link up screens and it's just
50:28 - nothing really beats it for that
50:30 - um it does have its drawbacks it's not
50:32 - like you can't you know whereas in
50:34 - sketch you can design in a slightly more
50:37 - freehand way without thinking of the
50:39 - html output you can do that which is is
50:42 - a bit more limited in web flow but you
50:44 - know
50:45 - it's horses for courses and it really
50:47 - depends on you know the project itself
50:49 - and what you're looking to kind of
50:51 - achieve and do so let's build out this
50:53 - page real quick so let's jump to the
50:56 - freelancers page we have nothing there
50:58 - but let's grab this and we're just going
51:00 - to use exactly the same layout and set
51:02 - up i'm going to grab our header
51:05 - and we're going to put that on the
51:06 - freelancers page
51:10 - i'm going to grab our section wide here
51:12 - and again
51:14 - it's just you know super simple copy and
51:16 - paste drop stuff in
51:18 - i'm going to call this freelancers
51:22 - and we're going to get rid of
51:25 - this bit and this bit i'm going to keep
51:27 - the same section inner
51:29 - and then we're going to grab some um
51:33 - camtasia open there
51:35 - then we're going to grab some
51:37 - three columns and we're going to grab
51:41 - put them in here
51:45 - what we're going to do is say three call
51:47 - row again
51:49 - change that so it's there
51:53 - cool one
51:55 - as actually i probably could have made
51:57 - my life easier by keeping the other one
51:59 - that was there but too late now okay so
52:03 - um call free
52:05 - then what we're going to do is grab div
52:07 - and we're going to call this we're just
52:09 - going to call it freelancer
52:12 - card
52:13 - let's call this directory card right
52:15 - because
52:16 - it could be a freelancer it could be a
52:18 - business it could be a project
52:20 - um
52:22 - again it's all to do with the kind of
52:24 - the site architecture and how we're
52:25 - gonna sort of approach things and lay
52:27 - things out on the different classes and
52:29 - names that we're gonna give to things
52:31 - something would probably consider in
52:32 - more detail if this was a real project
52:34 - but you know just for the purposes of
52:36 - this video i'm kind of
52:38 - storming through it a bit
52:40 - um so let's
52:43 - get a little block here let's call this
52:46 - directory
52:48 - image
52:50 - let's give that 50 by 50.
52:53 - now we want that to appear
52:57 - in the middle so let's set a margin of
52:59 - auto
53:00 - let's give our card a little background
53:03 - let's make it white
53:05 - um
53:07 - let's make the image gray
53:10 - turn that into a little circle
53:12 - using border radius and again give this
53:15 - card some padding so we've got a nice
53:18 - amount of padding on it
53:24 - maybe that could be a bit bigger you
53:25 - know maybe let's do that
53:29 - uh okay
53:31 - let's call this
53:34 - directory title
53:39 - directory description
53:51 - cool
53:52 - um and then we're gonna add these little
53:54 - buttons in as well
53:56 - so let's add in
54:00 - connect
54:02 - sorry profile button
54:06 - and let's add another one let's call
54:08 - this connect button
54:13 - cool
54:15 - all right
54:16 - let's actually bring this stuff now into
54:19 - the card
54:21 - and take these
54:27 - cool
54:28 - so let's turn this into a title
54:31 - so
54:32 - let's make it like that
54:34 - let's give it a name
54:36 - just so we we're consistent with what
54:38 - we've got we're not going to give it a
54:39 - name we're going to say freelancer title
54:42 - actually you know what it let's
54:45 - let's give it a name david smith
54:49 - right
54:52 - to be in the middle that also wants to
54:53 - be in the middle
54:55 - right let's add some
54:57 - margins and things like that
55:01 - here
55:02 - maybe shorten this
55:06 - cool
55:08 - 20 pixels again
55:11 - and then
55:13 - what we want to do is
55:16 - we want these to appear
55:18 - so
55:20 - if we
55:21 - that there they're gonna appear in the
55:23 - middle
55:24 - actually didn't need to do this
55:27 - actually yeah i did
55:29 - what i should be able to do i think is
55:32 - yeah
55:33 - so if you change if something's an
55:36 - inline element which is basically what
55:38 - this setting here does
55:40 - um
55:42 - an inline element will move
55:45 - will kind of adjust to the alignment
55:47 - settings of its container so in this
55:50 - case the alignment settings of the
55:51 - container are center
55:53 - so this will it's this um aligns to
55:55 - center as well if i turn that to a block
55:57 - level element it also does the same
55:59 - thing
56:00 - okay
56:02 - obviously i don't know what i'm talking
56:03 - about
56:06 - i do know what i'm talking about but i'm
56:08 - um
56:11 - i i know that it just
56:13 - somehow like behaves differently
56:18 - ah webflow
56:28 - connect
56:29 - cool all right so let's just duplicate
56:32 - this now
56:34 - and again real simple just duplicate
56:36 - this three column row
56:38 - but we want to add some
56:41 - padding again so let's call this
56:46 - sorry we want to add to margin at the
56:47 - bottom we don't necessarily want to add
56:48 - it to the
56:49 - three column row
56:51 - so let's let's just try and think about
56:53 - breaking things up into
56:56 - different
56:57 - kind of containers and kind of
56:59 - separating things out with
57:01 - with styling so let's just call this
57:03 - directory block
57:09 - right
57:10 - let's just have six
57:12 - sorry nine and then let's add
57:15 - there we go so that that didn't take any
57:18 - time at all to make and that's you know
57:22 - it's coming together man it's you know
57:25 - it's it's a nice prototype
57:28 - um i don't know why it's asking me to
57:30 - translate i think it's because it's got
57:32 - lorem ipsum in it which is fine
57:34 - okay so this is fine but what we're
57:37 - lacking a little bit here is some kind
57:39 - of alignment and this
57:41 - whole grid system that i've got on got
57:43 - going on it is not quite right so
57:46 - what i think i want to do is give this
57:49 - section in a right a width for 100
57:52 - right but then what i want to do is set
57:53 - a max width
57:55 - and we can illustrate that if we
57:57 - give it a ridiculously small max width
58:00 - um so you see it constrains to 500
58:03 - pixels that's the the maximum width that
58:05 - it could be um but we don't want to do
58:08 - that i'm gonna give it like 1200 right
58:11 - and then there's there's a couple of
58:12 - ways that i could
58:14 - i could maybe do this so i could
58:20 - i think if that if i get rid of that
58:24 - and i set this to auto
58:29 - that
58:31 - it kind of goes into the middle there
58:36 - oh this latin thing is really annoying
58:40 - never translate this side
58:43 - okay but that that doesn't really work
58:45 - then
58:47 - i guess this is this is a broader
58:49 - question about the design
58:51 - do we want the center column to be
58:53 - always aligned in the middle of the
58:54 - screen or do we want it to kind of be
58:57 - on the left and then it has like a max
58:59 - width
59:00 - um what i'm going to do is
59:05 - i'm gonna just
59:07 - i'm just gonna have it being on the left
59:09 - and then going as having like a max
59:11 - width
59:13 - and again this is a prototype this isn't
59:15 - the
59:16 - final finished design like if if this
59:18 - was
59:19 - the real sight maybe we have like a
59:21 - masonry kind of layout here so
59:23 - this this card here it would kind of
59:27 - uh fly up and go on to the left of this
59:30 - card here so you have like a sort of a
59:32 - pinterest type board thing going on but
59:34 - you can't really prototype that very
59:35 - easily in webflow
59:37 - but it's still it gets the um
59:40 - it gets the kind of the concept across
59:43 - and maybe even
59:45 - maybe 1200 it's a bit short let's try
59:47 - that
59:48 - right
59:55 - yeah cool so that's looking pretty good
59:57 - what we're now now going to do is look
59:59 - at how we can make it responsive
60:01 - and turn it into a responsive post
60:03 - excuse me prototype that
60:06 - obviously responds across different
60:07 - screen sizes using the very
60:10 - kind of powerful way that webflow allows
60:13 - you to build responsive designs
60:16 - so let's just start
60:18 - let's start let's start with the
60:19 - dashboard
60:21 - um okay so
60:23 - this is kind of our desktop view and
60:24 - that's fine but obviously when we view
60:27 - it on smaller devices we want to make it
60:29 - respond properly
60:32 - so the first thing we're going to do is
60:34 - we're going to hide this
60:37 - section left
60:40 - this is our kind of sidebar and we're
60:42 - gonna hide that
60:43 - and we're gonna bring that in
60:46 - uh in just a moment when we look at the
60:48 - or sorry a bit later on when we actually
60:51 - look at interactions because what we're
60:52 - gonna do is have a kind of a show and
60:54 - hide thing so we're gonna have like a
60:56 - hamburger menu up here and then we can
60:58 - show that sidebar on the left when
60:59 - someone hits the
61:01 - hamburger menu
61:03 - okay so we've got our section right
61:05 - which we
61:06 - have also got a section inner on
61:09 - and that's got a margin so let's get rid
61:11 - of that margin
61:12 - and let's add some padding to this so
61:15 - it's not flush up against
61:18 - the um
61:21 - what'd you call it the size of the
61:22 - container and then we've got this kind
61:25 - of three column layout which is looking
61:27 - a little bit squished um on tablet on a
61:31 - kind of a tablet side screen and we've
61:33 - got these two columns here as well so i
61:36 - mean i don't know i think it depends on
61:38 - the
61:39 - maybe the project and the the prototype
61:43 - um
61:45 - but i mean there's two ways we could do
61:46 - it we could have these stack one on top
61:48 - of each other which is really easy to do
61:49 - a web flow so you just kind of choose
61:51 - there that you want this to stack
61:53 - and i think for this i'm gonna just i'm
61:55 - gonna have that stack
61:58 - on top of each other like that these
62:01 - let's make this a little bit smaller so
62:04 - it doesn't break
62:06 - let's maybe bring that down to like 32
62:08 - or something
62:10 - okay and let's see how that's going to
62:12 - look
62:16 - when i am
62:19 - on a smaller screen size
62:23 - cool so it's like that
62:26 - there we go perfect and then it breaks
62:29 - again there which is what we want
62:31 - so
62:34 - that's cool
62:36 - so that now breaks so and this is what i
62:39 - love about web play making responsive
62:41 - designs is so easy
62:42 - um because of the way it kind of stacks
62:45 - up and just takes the existing page
62:47 - structure
62:48 - um so it's very easy just to make simple
62:50 - tweak excuse me make simple tweaks and
62:52 - make like a really easy responsive
62:54 - experience
62:56 - um
62:57 - we might also change the line height
62:59 - here just because it's on a single line
63:03 - and that kind of keeps everything a bit
63:04 - more compact
63:07 - and then we what we've got here is we've
63:10 - got like quite a bit big margin
63:12 - um so let's get rid of that
63:14 - notification block
63:17 - info block wrapper
63:20 - so we've got
63:22 - i said that to 20 pixels and then we
63:24 - also want to get the bottom margin of
63:26 - this last info box so we're going to
63:29 - call this
63:31 - box last
63:40 - again if you haven't watched the other
63:41 - tutorials i suggest you do just to kind
63:43 - of understand how we got to this place
63:45 - and a little bit like i said in those
63:47 - tutorials
63:48 - the point of this is it's not really
63:50 - like a web flow tutorial to to show you
63:52 - like the exact best practices and best
63:54 - ways to do things in web flow and
63:56 - understand css it's it's more just the
63:58 - process of getting like a rough concept
64:01 - interpr into webflow and
64:03 - just building out a very simple quick
64:06 - prototype that can be used for feedback
64:09 - um and for prototyping purposes
64:12 - so that's looking pretty good so we've
64:14 - got our kind of cards at the top here
64:16 - and things tend to break here and i
64:19 - think this is because i've got this
64:21 - section as a um
64:25 - yeah 100 pixels so we're going to ch
64:28 - sorry 100 uh vh which is the viewport
64:30 - height so we're going to change that to
64:32 - auto so it's going to fill
64:35 - um
64:37 - to the width
64:38 - of whatever's in it
64:41 - at 20 pixels here
64:45 - the other thing we might also do
64:47 - um
64:49 - is just add
64:51 - let's add a little bit of padding here
64:57 - a section wide
65:02 - oh that's not gonna work
65:05 - don't worry about that okay cool
65:09 - got that so that's coming together
65:12 - um but yeah the other thing i thought we
65:15 - we might do is just
65:18 - get rid of this
65:19 - border on here
65:23 - because it's
65:24 - there's nothing below it so it doesn't
65:26 - necessarily need a divider
65:30 - in a way what's below it is the
65:34 - it's the content
65:36 - sorry it's the the bottom of the box
65:41 - so new item last
65:46 - that's looking good
65:48 - there you go it's a bit cleaner
65:53 - it's looking nice
65:56 - maybe this
65:58 - be a bit smaller on mobile
66:02 - overview
66:05 - it's cool
66:09 - and so there
66:11 - so this is quite interesting um
66:15 - we get to this kind of screen size we
66:17 - want stuff to break and stack up on top
66:19 - of
66:20 - one another so we're gonna have it look
66:21 - like this
66:23 - new freelancers
66:26 - so
66:28 - what we're gonna do is
66:32 - just make sure that this
66:35 - is no longer floated
66:38 - and then that will also push those down
66:40 - as well so we've got like a
66:42 - icon or an image for whatever it is on
66:45 - the job post and then we've got you know
66:47 - the job title the description
66:51 - cool
66:52 - okay let's just have a look at how
66:54 - that's looking in the browser
66:56 - i know there's you can also do it this
66:58 - way in webflow i just just kind of a
67:02 - habit i have of viewing stuff like this
67:05 - so it gets to there
67:09 - okay i might need
67:12 - to i might need to have a think about
67:15 - that
67:19 - goes to there and then it stacks up
67:22 - rather nicely on kind of much smaller
67:25 - screen sizes as well
67:28 - um let's just take a look at this page
67:31 - the thing i was you know when you get to
67:33 - this kind of screen size
67:36 - it doesn't really work so
67:38 - i'm gonna have another look at that in a
67:40 - second um
67:42 - let's just take a look at this page
67:46 - so again i think these these are going
67:48 - to be quite cramped if there's a lot of
67:50 - text or maybe long titles i think
67:52 - squashing these cards up
67:54 - doesn't really work that well
67:57 - um
68:01 - it kind of goes like that
68:06 - i don't know i think that could work
68:08 - let's leave it like that so
68:12 - again you know
68:14 - it's just just a kind of a concept and
68:16 - an idea
68:19 - let's had a bit of padding with these
68:21 - guys
68:23 - maybe we try this full width
68:27 - same with that one
68:28 - so kind of fill up properly
68:31 - so we've got our cards like this
68:33 - and we're kind of getting to a smaller
68:34 - screen size our cards look something
68:36 - like that
68:38 - then at this screen size they stack on
68:40 - top of one another so what we want to do
68:42 - is
68:42 - add a margin bottom to the cards so it
68:45 - spaces them out
68:48 - and then we want to take the margin off
68:50 - of the directory block
68:53 - which is this stuff here
68:57 - that's looking great
68:59 - then on smaller screen sizes that also
69:00 - works perfectly as well
69:02 - and we've got the dashboard h1 which is
69:05 - also on the
69:07 - dashboard h1 here this has been
69:09 - inherited
69:10 - so this freelancer page inherits the
69:12 - styles obviously across the board
69:14 - um so that when we get to the smaller
69:16 - screen size the sizes of this change as
69:18 - well
69:20 - so let's take a look at that
69:29 - it's looking good
69:32 - take a quick look at the login screen
69:37 - okay so
69:41 - header wide
69:44 - [Music]
69:46 - i think that's
69:47 - broken the container because it's
69:49 - floated
69:51 - we can change that if we have um
69:55 - overflow auto if you set auto
69:59 - so if you float something within a
70:00 - container it kind of moves it out the
70:03 - flow of the container so if the
70:04 - container doesn't have a specific height
70:06 - set
70:07 - then it defaults back to zero
70:11 - but you can change that by setting
70:12 - overflow auto
70:15 - i'm not actually sure of the specific
70:17 - reason for that but it's just i know
70:19 - that's what works
70:21 - um
70:23 - okay cool login
70:25 - let's just make this a little bit
70:27 - smaller
70:28 - so we've got this at 38 32
70:31 - a bit more proportion
70:33 - i'll screen a smaller screen size let's
70:35 - bring that down even more
70:40 - not a huge amount to do on this page
70:43 - um
70:45 - and then when we get to here
70:48 - section wide
70:51 - um
70:58 - let's set some padding on it i thought
71:00 - we already did that
71:02 - but i did that on
71:03 - something else
71:05 - section in the right okay so
71:09 - let's get rid of the padding on that
71:12 - um
71:14 - and instead let's set the padding on
71:17 - section wide
71:20 - actually no i don't think that's gonna
71:21 - work
71:23 - nope
71:25 - okay let's go back to
71:32 - this section right
71:38 - the reason
71:40 - uh
71:43 - yeah like the reason that isn't gonna
71:45 - work
71:46 - is because it's gonna push this sidebar
71:48 - out to the right as well
71:50 - so let's just get rid of this so we're
71:52 - inheriting that padding that's great
71:56 - cool so let's go back to the login
71:57 - screen
71:59 - um
72:02 - okay let's add some padding to this
72:04 - login form
72:09 - so that when we get onto the smaller
72:10 - screen sizes it doesn't sit flush to the
72:13 - right of the
72:16 - to the parent
72:17 - um
72:18 - and let's also
72:20 - take out some of this padding
72:27 - cool
72:29 - again
72:30 - you know it's quick it's dirty it's just
72:33 - building a very simple
72:34 - kind of prototype
72:37 - and like a rapid way of doing it
72:39 - just to get something built and kind of
72:41 - show to be able to show to people and
72:43 - communicate ideas
72:50 - cool
72:54 - right let's uh
72:57 - go to here
73:01 - this is linked up
73:06 - so we can just look at our flow now so
73:07 - that's goes to freelancers
73:10 - then on the freelancers page
73:12 - we have that so our flow would be
73:14 - something like the user lands on the
73:16 - page we're going to log in
73:18 - email rob
73:20 - robertsmith.com
73:22 - password
73:23 - whatever cool let's log in ah nice got
73:26 - our dashboard
73:28 - cool let's check out the freelancer
73:29 - directory
73:31 - simple prototype simple flow from
73:34 - signing in to going to find a freelancer
73:36 - so the last thing that we're going to
73:37 - look at just to give it a bit of
73:38 - interest is
73:40 - a couple of interactions so the first
73:42 - thing i'm going to focus on is the
73:45 - responsive navigation so we hid this
73:48 - kind of sidebar
73:50 - navigation in the responsive view
73:52 - so we're going to look at a way to kind
73:54 - of bring that back and expose that as a
73:56 - kind of slide-out type menu
73:59 - using a hamburger menu in the responsive
74:01 - view
74:03 - so
74:04 - what i'm going to do is just create my
74:07 - hamburger
74:10 - link
74:13 - um
74:14 - so let's grab a div
74:17 - and
74:18 - let's call it
74:20 - hamburger block
74:24 - um
74:25 - let's float it to
74:27 - the right
74:31 - okay that's on the right
74:36 - cool
74:37 - um let's just give it a width and a
74:38 - height so we need like 50 pixels by 50
74:40 - pixels
74:42 - um
74:44 - let's just
74:46 - make it look like that for the minute
74:47 - and what we're going to do is just set
74:48 - up the interaction first then we can
74:50 - just maybe look at the detail and the
74:51 - design of the actual
74:53 - hamburger block itself
74:55 - so
74:56 - um
74:59 - i think what we want to do
75:01 - is
75:02 - rather than
75:03 - [Music]
75:05 - okay so this is where it gets
75:06 - interesting so
75:08 - we've hidden section left
75:12 - um
75:13 - maybe rather than doing that what we
75:15 - want to do
75:17 - is
75:19 - we want to position it
75:21 - elsewhere so let's just position it off
75:24 - the screen right so minus 200 pixels
75:28 - so when it gets to there it's still
75:30 - there but it's off the screen
75:34 - okay let's just see if this works
75:36 - in practical terms
75:39 - um
75:46 - cool so it's still there but it's just
75:48 - hidden right what we're going to do is
75:50 - basically
75:51 - use this menu block this button trigger
75:55 - to just trigger the navigation to slide
75:57 - in
75:58 - so let's head over to interactions
76:01 - um
76:02 - i'm just going to use a legacy
76:03 - interaction for the minute just to keep
76:05 - it simple
76:08 - um
76:10 - and we're just going to call this
76:12 - responsive
76:14 - navigation
76:17 - we're going to just say our trigger is a
76:20 - click so when we click on this
76:21 - particular thing
76:23 - what we want to do is affect a different
76:25 - element and the element that we want to
76:27 - effect is section left
76:31 - so click
76:32 - element that we want to affect is
76:34 - section left
76:35 - right
76:37 - and what we want to do is we want to say
76:39 - when that is clicked we bring
76:45 - we change the
76:46 - position um
76:49 - of
76:50 - section left
76:51 - by 200 pixels
76:54 - now it doesn't really make sense on this
76:56 - view but when we go down to this view
76:58 - we see that it makes sense right
77:03 - so
77:04 - um
77:06 - that should be fine
77:08 - um and then what we want to say is
77:12 - so we want to add the next part to that
77:15 - so we want to say on the second click
77:21 - this moves back to its origin
77:27 - switch is going to move it back off the
77:29 - screen
77:31 - so let's try that that goes to there
77:33 - bang bang
77:35 - very cool very cool
77:38 - um
77:41 - all right that's pretty much the
77:42 - interaction so let's just
77:44 - i'm just going to show you how to build
77:46 - a nice little hamburger
77:48 - menu it's like a way that i like to do
77:50 - it so
77:51 - let's just grab div
77:53 - put it in this div and let's just call
77:55 - it hamburger
77:57 - strip one
77:59 - and spell hamburger right
78:05 - right let's set width 100
78:07 - because it's going to be the width of
78:09 - that block
78:12 - set like a height of two pixels
78:15 - let's give it a background as well right
78:18 - so let's give it like that kind of
78:20 - background let's actually make this a
78:22 - little bit more
78:26 - let's make the width let's make a bit
78:27 - smaller 40x40 okay
78:30 - i'm also just gonna
78:33 - add a bit of
78:35 - margin to that so it doesn't interfere
78:37 - with it
78:38 - i'm also going to bring this block down
78:43 - okay cool
78:45 - so we've got our strip one which is like
78:47 - the first line
78:48 - i'm going to take this and we're going
78:50 - to call it
78:52 - strip two
78:55 - second line set it with 100
78:58 - height 2 pixels you know what let's go
78:59 - for 4 pixels
79:02 - let's give it a background color
79:05 - uh
79:07 - we can copy that
79:09 - okay let's give this one
79:12 - the same color let's give it a height
79:14 - four pixels now let's add
79:18 - let's add like
79:20 - four pixels between them
79:22 - i'm just going to make the last strip
79:25 - um
79:27 - hamburger strip three
79:30 - same thing again with 100
79:32 - just so it takes up that container four
79:34 - pixels
79:36 - um
79:37 - same background color
79:42 - okay just into a lost
79:53 - cool and then what we're going to do is
79:56 - grab that strip
80:00 - cool
80:02 - so we've got if you like we've got a
80:04 - hamburger block which is like our
80:06 - container then within that we've got
80:07 - four strips that kind of actually
80:09 - represent the design of the hamburger
80:10 - menu
80:11 - and we're just gonna move those down and
80:14 - then we're gonna get rid of this
80:14 - background so we've got the strips in a
80:17 - container
80:18 - um but they're not actually
80:22 - and it's the container that actually
80:23 - dictates the position of of where it
80:25 - appears
80:28 - let's just maybe make that a little bit
80:30 - more 35 pixels
80:33 - shorter
80:35 - cool so
80:39 - and the last thing we want to do is hide
80:40 - this on desktop so we'll hide that let
80:43 - me say when we hit a responsive view we
80:47 - want it to appear
80:52 - there we go
80:54 - so we've got
80:56 - desktop view
80:59 - we get down to our responsive view
81:02 - click our hamburger we get our slide out
81:04 - navigation and then we can keep going
81:08 - all the way down awesome cool there we
81:10 - have it
81:12 - okay so i hope that's been useful uh
81:15 - what we've done just as a quick recap
81:17 - we've taken a kind of a wireframe
81:19 - concept for a dashboard
81:22 - for an online freelancer platform that i
81:24 - just very quickly put together
81:26 - and i've just shown you how to quickly
81:28 - bring that into webflow and just kind of
81:31 - talk to you a little bit about how i'd
81:33 - approach building a webflow
81:35 - a little bit about how i approach
81:37 - prototyping in webflow
81:41 - and just to kind of give you an a bit of
81:43 - an idea of what's possible and why it's
81:45 - a great tool to use
81:47 - so i hope you enjoyed that again if
81:48 - you've got any questions or comments
81:50 - leave them in the um
81:52 - in the feedback section below
