00:00 - if you're planning on designing or
00:02 - developing a website before you get
00:04 - started it's really important to be able
00:05 - to do wireframing so that both you and
00:08 - the client has a good idea of what it is
00:10 - exactly that you're building and how
00:12 - it'll work
00:13 - in this video i wanted to talk a little
00:15 - bit more about wireframing what it is
00:17 - how it works and we'll even build out a
00:19 - wireframe so you guys can see the full
00:21 - process and we'll build this example out
00:23 - over here if you haven't heard of me
00:25 - before that's fine i'm adrian from
00:27 - australia i do videos around design and
00:29 - development and you can check out my
00:30 - channel in the description below but
00:32 - without further ado let's just jump
00:34 - straight into it if you haven't heard of
00:36 - wireframing before that's fine what it
00:38 - is is essentially a visual blueprint for
00:40 - how the website will work as well as the
00:42 - pages themselves and it also works as a
00:45 - schema for the functionality of a system
00:48 - so that you get a better representation
00:50 - of what's going on it's really useful
00:52 - and it's really easy to do as well it
00:54 - can take a number of forms you could
00:56 - just use a piece of paper and sketch it
00:58 - out or you could use your ipad or even
01:01 - one of the third-party websites which
01:03 - allow you to do wireframing these days
01:05 - we're going to take a look at a few of
01:06 - these examples to see how we can build
01:08 - our own wireframe but if you want to get
01:11 - started on your own you can get started
01:12 - with just a piece of paper and if you're
01:14 - worried that you're not a ui designer
01:16 - and a graphics designer in general and
01:19 - you're not too sure what's going on well
01:21 - you don't have to worry about any of
01:22 - that because wireframing doesn't require
01:24 - really any understanding of ui you just
01:27 - need the bare essentials of being able
01:29 - to draw boxes and circles we're not
01:31 - going to look into colors we're not
01:33 - going to look into content or logos or
01:35 - any of that wireframing is just the way
01:38 - that the pages will work and anyone
01:40 - who's doing design or development will
01:42 - be able to jump straight into it so
01:44 - let's take a look at how we get started
01:46 - by creating our very first wireframe
01:49 - in this example i'm going to be using my
01:52 - ipad and i'm going to be using an
01:54 - application called concepts which is
01:56 - just made for drawing but i'll put a
01:59 - link in the description below so that
02:01 - you guys can download it if that's
02:03 - something you guys want to use otherwise
02:05 - you can use a pen and paper just as well
02:08 - the very first thing i like to do before
02:10 - i even begin my wireframing and
02:13 - something that i think is really
02:14 - important is creating your sitemap
02:17 - the sitemap gives your entire website
02:20 - direction so that you know what pages
02:22 - you're building
02:23 - and with most site maps the very first
02:25 - thing that you start off with is a home
02:28 - page
02:29 - every other page flows out of that home
02:31 - page so you want to begin with that and
02:34 - the very first thing you want to do is
02:35 - probably write out the most important
02:38 - pages you have so besides the home page
02:41 - this is usually things like the services
02:43 - page or the product page or the contact
02:46 - us page these pages are the core of your
02:49 - website and if you're doing an
02:51 - application in this case maybe these are
02:53 - your main screens that you want to route
02:55 - to
02:56 - but these are the ones that have sub
02:58 - pages under them as well
03:00 - by creating a sitemap just very simply
03:03 - and visually like this you'll be able to
03:06 - show and represent how all the pages
03:08 - work together if there are some pages
03:11 - you can branch them out as well and if
03:13 - some pages are linked to other sideways
03:16 - you can draw arrows to represent that
03:19 - in this example we're going to just
03:21 - start off with something very simple so
03:23 - what i want to be able to do is just an
03:25 - about us page maybe a features page and
03:28 - a home page and what we'll do is we'll
03:30 - design these as wireframes once we draw
03:33 - out the sitemap and we might even create
03:35 - a responsive design for them but to
03:37 - start off with let's create and finish
03:39 - up this sitemap just to see what we're
03:41 - going to be creating in this video today
03:44 - now that we have the site map done let's
03:48 - start off with our very first page and
03:50 - the first page we usually start on is
03:53 - the home page the home page usually
03:56 - represents the design that we're going
03:58 - to be utilizing for the rest of the
04:00 - pages and two of the most important
04:03 - parts of a home page are the header with
04:07 - its navigation and menu as well as its
04:10 - footer because that's going to exist on
04:12 - most of the other pages what we'll start
04:14 - off doing is creating a layout here for
04:18 - the home page and usually what i like to
04:20 - do is create it so it's quite wide we
04:23 - can zoom into it and we have enough
04:25 - there for almost 12 columns so that if
04:28 - we want to use things like bootstrap or
04:30 - other tools to do the layout they're
04:33 - ready to go otherwise we can always do
04:35 - our own layout for the ui
04:38 - for the first part of this layout what i
04:41 - want to be able to do is create a
04:43 - section here for the logo as well as the
04:46 - menu
04:47 - and what you'll do in wireframing
04:49 - usually is just create basic
04:52 - representations of these so in this case
04:54 - i'm just using a circle with the letter
04:56 - l there to represent where the logo will
04:59 - go and for the menu i'm just drawing out
05:01 - a number of boxes here with a shaded one
05:05 - representing the current one we're on
05:07 - and this will later be filled out with
05:09 - things like home about and other
05:11 - sections that we might have pages for
05:12 - but it gives us a quick representation
05:15 - of what the header will look like
05:17 - after we've finished designing the
05:20 - header we can start looking at creating
05:22 - the main hero image and the hero image
05:25 - these days are a big gigantic image that
05:28 - sort of runs behind the very front of
05:30 - the website as well as near the header
05:34 - and a lot of the cases these days you'll
05:36 - find that the menu actually sits on top
05:38 - of that header image well sometimes
05:40 - people like to place it in below
05:43 - and a lot of these headers as well
05:45 - sometimes are sliders so what i'm going
05:47 - to do is in this example i'm going to
05:49 - draw an arrow to the left here and the
05:52 - right and i'm gonna represent this with
05:54 - a number of dots as well as the text
05:56 - here to say that this will be a slider
05:58 - image and people will be able to slide
06:00 - between different options here
06:02 - now that we've done this top header
06:05 - section with our hero banner we can
06:06 - start moving on to the next section here
06:09 - on our home page
06:11 - and when we're designing a website
06:13 - usually the next thing that you want to
06:15 - be able to do is either a call to action
06:18 - or a bit of information about a website
06:21 - and this is really well represented with
06:23 - maybe an image a large title and some
06:26 - descriptions about what the website will
06:28 - be so what we're going to do is we're
06:30 - going to create a box here with a
06:32 - crosstalk to represent where we'll place
06:34 - an image and we're going to create a
06:36 - title section here which will have
06:38 - slightly larger fonts and a few lines to
06:41 - represent maybe some description or text
06:44 - will later fill in in this section
06:47 - now that we've got this section in and
06:48 - we're going to be creating more sections
06:50 - out it's good to be able to label our
06:52 - sections so that for anyone coming in
06:55 - from a third point of view they'll be
06:56 - able to know what each section is so
06:59 - what i'm going to do here is i'm going
07:00 - to create out labels for each one of
07:03 - these we'll have labels here for our
07:05 - menu for our hero banner and in this
07:07 - case for our about us section that way
07:10 - later when we need to reference it we
07:12 - can point it out and if someone is
07:14 - coming in they'll be able to identify it
07:16 - immediately
07:18 - now let's take a look at creating our
07:20 - next section over here and what i want
07:22 - to be able to do is usually i break them
07:25 - into line items because sometimes you'll
07:28 - be able to copy paste them across to
07:30 - other parts of the website and also
07:32 - really segregates them but in this case
07:35 - when you create the website later on
07:37 - with the ui and the u um ui design you
07:39 - might not need those section breaks but
07:42 - now we'll just create one more here and
07:44 - in this case i want to create a section
07:46 - break here for maybe something like
07:48 - testimonials or sponsors
07:51 - in this example for a wireframe we will
07:53 - have lots of sponsors to identify so i'm
07:56 - going to represent a nice big box here
07:58 - that's grayed out as a maybe h1 or h2
08:01 - maybe even a h3 tag here that'll
08:04 - represent that as sponsors later on and
08:06 - i'm going to draw a number of boxes
08:08 - because we'll have about 12 or so
08:10 - sponsors and each one of these will
08:12 - follow that similar column design that
08:14 - you would expect when you're doing
08:16 - bootstrap or you can fit about 12
08:18 - columns in a single section and with
08:20 - this done we'll be able to fill out this
08:23 - section quite neatly and we'll be able
08:25 - to identify it as a sponsor section
08:28 - now this is really quick and simple and
08:30 - you can see that even the line isn't
08:33 - that accurate and this is more or less
08:36 - done in just a few seconds the goal
08:38 - isn't here to have a perfect ui with
08:41 - perfect box shadows and backgrounds and
08:43 - colors it's really just to give a
08:45 - representation of how you plan the
08:47 - workflow of the website to be when
08:50 - you've got that workflow down you can
08:52 - move sections around you can move maybe
08:54 - the sponsor section up or down or to a
08:57 - different page entirely but the plan
08:59 - here is to give a representation of that
09:01 - section
09:02 - later if the client come back comes back
09:05 - and they only want three sponsors or two
09:08 - sponsors you can simply update the
09:10 - layout and maybe provide something
09:11 - different in that case the other thing
09:14 - i'm going to do in here is i'm going to
09:15 - add a button here to our about us
09:17 - section and this will simply be so that
09:20 - there is a small call to action there
09:22 - that if someone wants to learn more
09:24 - information about that about a section
09:26 - they can go to there
09:28 - let's take a look at creating a third
09:30 - section here
09:31 - this next section will be our footer
09:34 - section where we'll finish up the
09:36 - website design at least here on the home
09:39 - page and when you're doing the wireframe
09:41 - for a footer there's usually a few
09:43 - things you want to make sure that you
09:45 - add in there i think that having the
09:47 - logo reset and placed in there again
09:51 - sometimes in a reverse color is a good
09:53 - idea as well as maybe having a contact
09:55 - form and a site map so the first thing
09:58 - here i'm going to do is i'm going to
09:59 - create a small contact form which will
10:01 - have a shaded out title with some inputs
10:04 - and a button to submit
10:06 - since we want to show that this footer
10:08 - will have a darker color what i want to
10:11 - be able to do is show this visually so
10:13 - i'm going to draw a few lines here to
10:16 - represent that this might have a
10:18 - different shade or maybe it'll have a
10:19 - dark theme or something different in
10:21 - general just so that the footer stands
10:23 - out on each one of the pages
10:25 - once we've done that the next section
10:27 - here i'm going to create will actually
10:29 - be the site map now we don't have to
10:31 - give the actual pages in here i'm just
10:33 - going to draw lines to represent all the
10:35 - pages we might want to represent and
10:37 - sometimes you might want to limit down
10:39 - your site map just to the core essential
10:41 - pages but this is just a representation
10:43 - that will be having that in there and
10:46 - finally what i like to do is display the
10:48 - logo here last and the logo will also
10:52 - have a bit of information underneath and
10:54 - usually the last bit of information i
10:56 - like to include is maybe the phone
10:58 - number as well as the email address so
11:01 - that if someone's looking to contact
11:03 - their website service or product
11:05 - directly they'll be able to do that
11:06 - immediately sometimes it's good to have
11:09 - this on the header as well but at least
11:11 - this finishes up our footer section and
11:14 - this means that most of our home page
11:16 - here is now done and as you can see
11:19 - we've got our slider image about us
11:21 - section some sponsors and a simple
11:23 - footer
11:25 - i know that some people like to keep
11:27 - pages for the home page just a single
11:29 - maybe height and width where you might
11:32 - not even have any scrolling whereas
11:34 - other people might have parallax
11:35 - scrolling that might go and reach 20
11:38 - screens in height but sometimes that's
11:40 - too much so you have to make sure you
11:42 - balance it out
11:44 - now since we're doing wireframing one of
11:46 - the important things i think is
11:48 - worthwhile doing is labeling most of the
11:50 - content content we're working with
11:53 - this labeling is not really for us but
11:55 - it's more for the people viewing this
11:57 - who might not be web developers so what
12:00 - i'm going to do is i'm going to select a
12:01 - different color here in our tools and
12:03 - i'm going to basically start drawing out
12:06 - arrows to represent what some of the
12:08 - items here are and this will just be
12:11 - visually really simple sometimes you can
12:13 - do this on a separate layer so you can
12:15 - hide it later but i usually like to make
12:17 - it clear and defined so that if there
12:19 - are any questions then they'll be
12:21 - immediately answered by this labeling so
12:24 - here i'm going to label that the contact
12:26 - us form the footer as well as the
12:28 - business contact information and i'll
12:31 - work my way up so that if there are any
12:33 - other things that might be worth
12:35 - representing like the phone number and
12:36 - the email address they'll be really
12:38 - obvious and they'll stand out
12:41 - the other thing i like to do is maybe go
12:43 - through some of the other sections here
12:45 - as well if we're going to do good
12:48 - labeling we need to make sure that we
12:50 - represent what some of these section
12:52 - legends essentially are so in this case
12:55 - like the darker block here will be a
12:57 - title whereas these small boxes will be
13:00 - logos of the sponsors themselves and
13:02 - this just makes it a little bit easier
13:04 - to read
13:05 - let's go through our design here and
13:08 - clearly define each one of these so in
13:10 - this example this will be an intro title
13:13 - and we're going to have some
13:15 - introduction text here as well to
13:17 - represent what this information is
13:20 - finally let's go through and label this
13:22 - last image here on our left and what i
13:25 - want to be able to do is just show
13:26 - clearly that this will be an image that
13:28 - will represent the business or the
13:30 - information about the business in a
13:32 - particular way images are hard things
13:35 - sometimes people really want to have the
13:38 - ability to change an image to fit what
13:40 - information it's matching and sometimes
13:42 - they don't even have that so they use
13:44 - stock photography and during wireframing
13:46 - it's really not important which image
13:48 - you select it's more about labeling what
13:51 - you'll be doing and where it'll be laid
13:53 - out and later on when the client figures
13:55 - out what they want to do with all the
13:56 - imaging that's when you can do all of
13:58 - that
13:59 - finally let's quickly mark up our slider
14:01 - image in here and just say that there'll
14:03 - be multiple slides here so we'll need
14:05 - multiple images to display this home
14:07 - page and that finalizes most of our home
14:10 - page here and now that we're done with
14:12 - that i think we can move on to our next
14:15 - section when creating websites we do
14:18 - have a number of different page layouts
14:21 - and usually what we have is we have a
14:24 - internal page maybe a blog page a
14:27 - contact us page and a features page and
14:30 - each one of these will have slightly
14:32 - different layouts and in this case one
14:34 - of the difficult layouts to do is
14:36 - actually the features page this is the
14:39 - page that really has to promote your
14:41 - product or your website so what we
14:43 - usually like to do is we like to make it
14:46 - a little bit more interesting with more
14:47 - photos and text and call to actions to
14:50 - really engage the customer or the user
14:53 - of the website
14:54 - what i'm gonna do to create this page is
14:56 - i'm going to copy over the header
14:58 - section we want to keep a consistent
15:01 - header throughout all our web pages so
15:03 - in most cases i will be copying this
15:06 - across what's going to be different
15:07 - about this page is that we're not going
15:09 - to have that very large slider that we
15:12 - had on the home page
15:13 - instead we're going to have a title
15:15 - section here and i'm going to define
15:17 - this by creating a separate section in
15:19 - here and labeling it with the page title
15:22 - with a darker shade there to represent
15:24 - that h1 element
15:26 - this will later on be themed based on
15:29 - the colors that people might want to use
15:30 - for the features page but for the time
15:32 - being we'll just keep it black and white
15:34 - just so that we know that the title
15:36 - would be in there
15:37 - for the features page when we're
15:39 - creating different sections we need to
15:42 - really visually represent those in this
15:44 - case i want to represent the features
15:46 - page with a number of large images and
15:50 - large blocks of text to really show off
15:52 - what this product or service will be
15:54 - defining so what i'm going to do is i'm
15:56 - going to have a large square box here
15:58 - which will represent the image as well
16:00 - as a large title and a description and
16:03 - this will be our very first service in
16:06 - here in this case sometimes services
16:08 - have some bullet points to show off what
16:11 - they do so i'm going to create some
16:12 - bullet points in here and each one of
16:14 - those bullet points might have a tiny
16:16 - little icon or image as well
16:18 - and this creates our very first section
16:21 - here for a feature image but what's
16:23 - really cool now is that we can reuse
16:26 - this to create the next section for our
16:28 - next feature so what i'm going to do is
16:30 - i'm actually going to just copy over the
16:31 - layout that i previously used for the
16:33 - very first feature and i'm going to copy
16:36 - over the image as well and in this case
16:38 - i'm going to reuse them but slightly
16:40 - different i'm going to actually place
16:41 - them on opposite sides this will make
16:44 - the page just a little bit more
16:46 - interesting without actually trying to
16:48 - redefine it and it keeps things
16:50 - consistent as well
16:52 - now if we have a number of services we
16:55 - can actually just copy page
16:57 - copy paste each section down below once
17:00 - we've done this we'll have a very simple
17:04 - representation so that the user will
17:06 - understand what's going on on this page
17:08 - let's label this though for someone who
17:11 - might be viewing this wireframe we'll
17:14 - show off that this will be feature one
17:16 - feature 2 and feature 3.
17:19 - and later on we can find images and text
17:22 - to do this but for the time being this
17:25 - gives us a clear indication of what the
17:27 - features page will look like
17:30 - the only thing that this page is now
17:31 - missing is the footer but we can copy
17:35 - that across really easily so what i'm
17:37 - going to do is i'm actually just going
17:39 - to grab the footer here from our home
17:42 - page and we're going to copy that across
17:45 - straight across to our
17:47 - new features page and we'll be able to
17:49 - copy this across to all the other pages
17:51 - that we make
17:52 - we might not need some of that
17:54 - additional markup that we created there
17:56 - on the home page because it's a little
17:58 - bit redundant but what we can do and i
18:01 - can see that is missing is maybe a
18:04 - copyright section because whenever you
18:06 - do have a footer you do usually have all
18:08 - that information in there but usually
18:10 - also have a really small section there
18:12 - for a copyright so let's actually create
18:15 - that and that'll be just something
18:17 - really small on font size which is
18:19 - usually just a bit smaller than what the
18:22 - default font size is on a website
18:24 - and we'll just represent that with a
18:26 - single line but we'll mark it up to say
18:29 - that this will be the copyright section
18:32 - and let's also copy that across to our
18:35 - features page just so that it's
18:36 - consistent all the way throughout
18:39 - you'll find that when you're doing
18:40 - wireframes you can just do this in a few
18:43 - seconds and later when you're doing the
18:45 - actual layout and ui maybe in adobe xd
18:49 - or figma you can create out different
18:51 - section components which you'll really
18:53 - easily be able to add to other pages but
18:56 - in this case we'll just do it quickly
18:57 - and manually
18:58 - our features page and homepage are now
19:00 - done but right now we don't know how we
19:03 - get from one page to another page so
19:06 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
19:07 - just draw out some really large lines
19:09 - here to show how you navigate from one
19:12 - page to another the first will be here
19:14 - in our header where we'll design a line
19:16 - to show that one of the header items
19:18 - will take us to the features page and
19:20 - the other will be just in the about us
19:22 - section where when we select the button
19:25 - it'll also take us to the features page
19:28 - now that we've represented
19:30 - now that we've represented the
19:31 - navigation here on our wireframing we
19:33 - can move on to the next page the next
19:36 - page i want to create here is our about
19:39 - us page
19:40 - and actually
19:42 - maybe no maybe let's try a different
19:44 - page let's try doing a contact us page
19:47 - this one is actually underrated but it's
19:50 - one of my favorite pages i know that
19:52 - whenever i'm visiting a website or a
19:54 - service and i want to get in contact
19:57 - with them especially if they're a local
19:58 - near my area the contact us page is
20:01 - probably one of the very first ones i go
20:03 - to because i just want to give them a
20:04 - call or an email so in order to create
20:07 - this let's just simply copy out our
20:09 - header here again
20:11 - the contact us page has usually a number
20:14 - of elements so the header and the footer
20:16 - are the first two most basic ones and
20:18 - since we've designed those already i
20:19 - usually just copy them across for each
20:21 - page i do
20:22 - the other x the other aspects of the
20:25 - contact us page i usually like to add in
20:28 - are the um the phone number the email
20:31 - maybe a form to represent maybe a
20:34 - contact form that you might want to
20:35 - simply fill out as well as a map i think
20:38 - a map is important especially if your
20:40 - business is local or your website is
20:42 - doing a local service and people need to
20:44 - be able to get to it
20:46 - so let's copy out a small section here
20:48 - for our title like we've done similar to
20:51 - the features page again so that it's all
20:53 - consistent
20:55 - and then let's create some of those
20:58 - other elements so in this case let's
21:00 - create out a representation for the map
21:04 - in this case i'm just going to do it
21:06 - similar to what i did with the images on
21:08 - the home page in the features page where
21:10 - it's just a large box we do know google
21:13 - maps usually has a little box at the top
21:15 - left to represent the address but this
21:17 - should visualize that and we should be
21:19 - able to add some markup here as well to
21:22 - let people know that this will be a
21:23 - google map that they'll be able to
21:25 - actually click to and get directions
21:27 - straight to this business
21:30 - next up let's create this section here
21:32 - for maybe the contact us information so
21:36 - in this case i'm going to do a small
21:37 - little icon here and maybe this will be
21:39 - like a font awesome little phone or
21:42 - something like that with the phone
21:44 - number here and maybe we'll use another
21:46 - one just like this with maybe an
21:48 - envelope to represent the email address
21:51 - which we can add in the line below
21:53 - with these two being the most important
21:55 - we usually always add them at the very
21:57 - top and straight after that some people
21:59 - just like to send a message through a
22:02 - simple contact us form now in this case
22:04 - we already have a contact us form here
22:07 - on the footer so sometimes when you
22:09 - don't have those in the footer you can
22:12 - add them here to the contact us page but
22:14 - in this case since we already have one i
22:17 - think it might be a little bit redundant
22:18 - to add another one but what i might do
22:20 - is just add one in visually as a
22:22 - representation of what it should look
22:25 - like if we didn't have one in the footer
22:27 - and in this case it'll just be a few
22:29 - check boxes with maybe a larger one here
22:32 - which might be a text area where people
22:34 - can fill it out with a slightly darker
22:36 - call to action button which will be the
22:38 - contact form submit button and this
22:40 - should finalize our contact us page as
22:43 - you can see it's a lot smaller than our
22:46 - home page in our feature or page but
22:48 - it's because it's straight to the point
22:49 - it gives the information that we're
22:51 - trying to provide here straight away
22:53 - and in this case let's do some
22:55 - navigation to show how we'll get to that
22:58 - contact us page and in this case it'll
23:00 - just be selecting the menu at the top
23:02 - right to make sure that we're browsing
23:04 - straight there
23:06 - usually sometimes you also might have a
23:08 - contact us page somewhere near the
23:10 - footer but we'll keep it nice and simple
23:12 - in this case
23:13 - now that we have our home page and our
23:16 - features page and our contact us page
23:18 - done i think this is more or less most
23:21 - of our content done in general
23:24 - what we could do is we could lay out
23:26 - some of our components here just so it
23:28 - looks visually a little bit better
23:30 - if you're doing out wireframes usually
23:33 - you'll want to do quite a few pages you
23:36 - want to do internal pages category pages
23:39 - maybe product pages and lots more
23:42 - and the other thing you want to do is
23:43 - you want to make sure that you also
23:45 - create ones which might be responsive
23:47 - this means that you might want to create
23:49 - one ready for a tablet or a mobile phone
23:52 - let's take a look at how we can quickly
23:54 - do an example of a mobile responsive
23:57 - design for the home page because i think
23:59 - that would be useful just so that the
24:00 - user or the person viewing this
24:02 - wireframe gets a better representation
24:04 - of how the design adapts when you go
24:07 - down to a scroll smaller screen size so
24:09 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to put
24:10 - in a label here for mobile version
24:13 - and what i want to be able to do is
24:16 - create slightly smaller
24:19 - a slightly smaller width it'll be what
24:22 - you would expect for a mobile phone so
24:24 - it'll probably be a lot longer than the
24:27 - actual home page and we'll probably have
24:30 - to add slightly different elements in
24:32 - this case the very first element that we
24:34 - want to do when we're doing a mobile
24:36 - responsive design is a button for the
24:38 - menu and a second button for an
24:42 - interaction usually to call the service
24:44 - or business or maybe to email them or
24:47 - something like that
24:48 - we'll add the logo in the middle here
24:50 - because it'll probably be very small
24:52 - we'll have to make sure it has enough
24:53 - room
24:54 - and we'll still draw that little square
24:57 - in the background to represent the
24:59 - slider image which will be a lot smaller
25:01 - sometimes you don't even have sliders on
25:03 - the mobile version and you just have a
25:05 - single image let's put some mock-up here
25:08 - to represent what each one of these
25:10 - items are and in this case it'll just be
25:13 - the mobile button which will expand out
25:16 - the mobile menu as well as the phone
25:19 - number or mobile number depending on
25:21 - what it is let's draw out an l just
25:24 - there to represent the logo and have a
25:26 - look at creating our next section here
25:28 - our next section was an intro section
25:31 - which had an image it had a title a
25:34 - description and a button now since we
25:36 - don't have that same wide angle that we
25:39 - do on a desktop we really have to
25:40 - collapse this down to a single column
25:43 - and row and in this case what we're
25:45 - going to do is we're going to rearrange
25:47 - some of the content so it makes a bit
25:49 - more sense sometimes people put the
25:51 - image first but there's no context to
25:53 - that so what you want to do in this case
25:56 - is put the title with a description in
25:58 - first and then the image can follow this
26:01 - these will all be collapsed down to a
26:04 - single column so that they fit in nicely
26:06 - and they'll flow on based on the
26:08 - information that they provide
26:10 - let's actually copy out an arrow to show
26:13 - that this is the responsive version of
26:15 - this same content when we go to a
26:17 - responsive version we usually make the
26:20 - margins from the top to the bottom a bit
26:21 - smaller as well as the font size and the
26:23 - image is a bit smaller so as you can see
26:26 - this section is almost the same size as
26:28 - the previous section but obviously this
26:30 - might work differently in practice it
26:32 - depends on how you're arranging the
26:34 - content the next section here was the
26:36 - sponsor section
26:38 - and when we're collapsing down this
26:40 - section since the sponsors already are
26:43 - quite small we'll actually be able to
26:45 - fit about two in on the mobile design if
26:48 - you were to go up to a larger size maybe
26:50 - a tablet view or something like that
26:52 - maybe you could even expand them out to
26:54 - four or six items per row but in this
26:57 - case we'll just stick it in with two
26:59 - items or in this case maybe three items
27:02 - i don't know three looks like it's just
27:04 - barring the edge of what's possible but
27:07 - at least it doesn't make this section
27:09 - too large finally let's take a look at
27:12 - the last section here which is the
27:14 - footer and for the footer yes the
27:16 - contact us form is a little bit in the
27:18 - way so let's move that out of the way
27:21 - and let's create out this footer now
27:23 - since this footer actually does have
27:25 - quite a lot of content it's probably
27:27 - going to take up a lot more space
27:30 - the very first thing here we'll want to
27:32 - add in is our contact us form so let's
27:35 - represent that with a title a few inputs
27:38 - a text box and a button
27:41 - and after we create this we can move on
27:43 - to the site map and this will be the
27:46 - next main column here that we want to
27:49 - provide and this column will again have
27:52 - more or less the same information we
27:54 - could even copy paste it across
27:57 - and sometimes you might not even want to
27:59 - have so many items you might hide out
28:01 - one of the columns if you don't want to
28:03 - use them but in this case i do want to
28:05 - use them so i'm just going to create
28:07 - this next section here as a site map
28:10 - so let's put in a header section here to
28:13 - represent that and let's put in a few
28:15 - lines here to represent the menu items
28:18 - for that site map
28:19 - and finally let's create our last
28:21 - section here which will be for the logo
28:24 - and the contact information so in this
28:27 - case since we're on a mobile design we
28:30 - could make the logo here for this footer
28:32 - section full width or we could make it
28:35 - half width and we can create icons here
28:38 - for the phone number in the email
28:40 - and that finalizes our mobile design
28:43 - we now have our home page with a mobile
28:45 - version our features page and our
28:47 - contact us page and these are the basic
28:50 - building blocks to create out the rest
28:52 - of the website
28:54 - what i'm gonna do is put a copy of this
28:57 - wireframe as an svg in the description
29:00 - of this video so you guys can check it
29:02 - out i've done lots of wireframes in the
29:05 - past sometimes i just simply use a piece
29:07 - of paper and pen to create them whereas
29:10 - other times i might create something in
29:12 - figma or a third-party tool but the goal
29:15 - here isn't to essentially use a certain
29:17 - tool to do it it's more about creating a
29:19 - simple view for yourself and the client
29:22 - to present as a plan of what you're
29:25 - building for your next website or
29:26 - application and i might do some videos
29:29 - later on on ui design things like color
29:32 - theory and how to create uis in general
29:34 - and i hope you guys will check those out
29:36 - in the future if you forgot who i am i'm
29:39 - adrian from australia and i do videos
29:41 - around design and development you can
29:43 - check out my channel in the description
29:45 - below where i do things on react and
29:47 - wordpress and ui but otherwise i hope
29:49 - you guys enjoyed this video if you did

29:54 - comment and i'll see you in the next one
