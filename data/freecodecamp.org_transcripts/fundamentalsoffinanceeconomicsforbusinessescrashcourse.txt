00:00 - Dive deep into the world of finance and economics with this comprehensive video course.
00:05 - Whether you want to make smarter investment decisions or you're looking to grasp the
00:10 - intricacies of global economies, this course lays a great foundation.
00:14 - The course combines theory with practical insights, paving the way for you to navigate
00:18 - the financial realm with confidence.
00:20 - Sriram originally taught this course in person and now has put together an excellent video
00:25 - course on these important topics.
00:28 - Hello everyone. My name is Sriram Chundi and I'll be taking you through this course
00:33 - on economics and finance and how they're relevant for businesses.
00:37 - Throughout this course, we'll be learning a variety of topics, starting with the key
00:41 - concepts for business, capital markets, valuation of stocks, business strategies and financial
00:46 - statements, how to analyze these financial statements, and things like capital budgeting
00:51 - and cash flow.
00:52 - We'll also discuss things like the business cycle and industry analysis, ESG, macroeconomics,
00:58 - portfolio diversification, and alternative investment types.
01:02 - Throughout this course, you'll learn a variety of different topics in all three of these
01:05 - disciplines and understand the interconnected nature of economics, finance, and business
01:10 - in this world.
01:11 - I also have a YouTube channel called Changemakers Media, which you can see in the comments.
01:15 - I would greatly appreciate it if you guys could subscribe there.
01:18 - I share stories on how teens are making an impact in the world and how you can go ahead
01:22 - and support them.
01:25 - Welcome to the first class on economics and finance.
01:29 - So a thought experiment to start.
01:31 - Imagine you had a magic box and it outputs a dollar a day or $5 or $20, how much ever
01:36 - you want, and it runs forever.
01:39 - How much would you pay for this box?
01:41 - Some people say a million dollars, some people say a billion.
01:44 - Well, let's look at it from a statistical standpoint.
01:47 - Instead of a box, let's imagine we have a savings account and it gives you 1.05% interest
01:52 - annually.
01:53 - How much would you have to put into the savings account to generate a dollar a day?
01:57 - Well, using Excel, we can identify that the principal or the original amount we'd have
02:02 - to invest is $34,761.
02:06 - This is a large amount, and fairly so.
02:09 - This is due to the small interest rate that we're getting on in our savings account.
02:14 - Let's look at another example.
02:16 - Imagine you want to buy a house, and the market price is $100,000.
02:20 - You contribute $20,000 towards this down payment and take out an $80,000 mortgage, which is
02:24 - a loan.
02:28 - How much would you have to pay to get rid of the mortgage?
02:30 - Well, if you have an annual contribution of $9,396, you would assume it would take just
02:37 - about 8 or 9 years to pay off the mortgage.
02:40 - But in reality, it takes 20 years, and this is due to the interest rate of 10% applied
02:45 - on this mortgage.
02:46 - If you look towards the bottom over the course of our payments, you notice that from 2019
02:51 - to 2020, our balance or the principal only drops by $1,400ish.
02:58 - This is because the majority of our $9,000 contribution is going towards paying off interest
03:02 - on the mortgage, and we see this effect persisting throughout the course of our payments.
03:07 - However, it does diminish as the size of the principal decreases and our interest payments
03:13 - decrease.
03:14 - So, our key concepts for today's class.
03:18 - Returnal investment and time value of money, and net present value.
03:22 - So, would you rather make in a return of $1,000 or 25% on an investment?
03:29 - You can't really compare.
03:31 - Apples and Toe origins.
03:33 - So, what is ROI?
03:36 - ROI is a tool that allows you to compare the efficiency of one investment to another investment,
03:41 - thus allowing you to compare apples and oranges.
03:44 - ROI measures the amount of return an investment generates relative to the amount that you
03:48 - invested.
03:49 - So, this is the formula for return on an investment.
03:52 - Current value of an investment minus the cost divided by the cost.
03:56 - So, let's take an example of the house again.
03:59 - Imagine you purchased it for $100,000 upfront.
04:02 - And now, the market value of the house is $150,000.
04:06 - Using the ROI formula, we can deduce that you had a 50% return on investment.
04:11 - So, why is ROI important?
04:14 - Because it allows you to compare assets of different classes and express it as a percentage.
04:19 - It also provides a basic measure as universal to compare an investment's profitability
04:23 - as a basic element in all analysis and decisions for companies and individuals.
04:29 - But it is limited.
04:30 - So, let's look at this example.
04:32 - In investment 1, you invest $1,000 in some real estate and sell it for $1,200 a year
04:38 - later.
04:39 - So, your ROI is 20%.
04:42 - In investment 2, you bought $2,000 a stock and sold it for $2,800 three years later.
04:48 - Using the formula, you have a 40% ROI.
04:50 - So, according to ROI, the second investment is better.
04:53 - But when you look at the time considerations, you spend three times as much time to make
04:58 - that 40% ROI as you did for the 20% ROI.
05:01 - Hence, ROI is not the say all be all measure of the value of an investment.
05:07 - Okay, now let's look at this time value of money.
05:12 - Continuous compounding.
05:13 - So, let's assume you have a savings account and it generates 10% interest per year over
05:17 - 20 years.
05:18 - Initially, you invest $1 into this account.
05:21 - Over the course of 20 years, with that 10% interest rate, the value of your account will
05:26 - rise to $6.73.
05:29 - That's 6.73 times the amount you initially invested.
05:33 - And this is the power of continuous compounding or compound interest.
05:38 - So, time value of money.
05:40 - This concept says that money is worth more today than in the future because of the potential
05:45 - earning capacity that money has, as seen in the example, and because the power of money
05:50 - decreases due to macroeconomic effects such as inflation.
05:54 - So, would you prefer $1 today or $1 in 5 years time?
05:59 - With our previous example, we can deduce that we would like $1 today.
06:03 - This is because we have the potential cash flows that money can create during this period
06:07 - as well as the avoiding of the potential effects of inflation.
06:14 - Now we have net present value, the last of our three key concepts for this section of
06:18 - the video.
06:19 - So, net present value is a pretty straightforward concept.
06:23 - And it's as the name suggests, the net of all cash inflows and cash outflows to determine
06:29 - the value of an asset.
06:31 - Cash inflows and cash outflows essentially represent the income and the sunken costs
06:36 - that an investment has taken.
06:38 - So, how do we calculate the net present value?
06:42 - But before we can calculate it, we need to understand, net present value is an important
06:46 - tool to determine the value of an investment.
06:48 - If net present value is greater than zero, that means an investment was a positive investment
06:53 - generating good returns.
06:55 - Before we can calculate what net present value is, we have to understand something called
06:59 - the discount rate.
07:01 - Discount rate is the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash
07:05 - flows in a discounted cash flow analysis.
07:09 - Essentially it's the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges on short term loans.
07:14 - We use it to calculate the value of money in the future due to macroeconomic policies
07:19 - like inflation which decrease the value of future cash flows.
07:23 - So, once we understand what the discount rate is, we can accurately calculate the net present
07:28 - value.
07:29 - So, let's assume you purchased a vending machine.
07:31 - To purchase the vending machine, you had to spend $10,000.
07:34 - This is reflected in year zero with a minus $10,000 cash flow, which is a negative cost.
07:40 - In year one, your vending machine returns you $2,000 in profits, and in subsequent years
07:45 - it returns $3,000, $5,000, and $7,000.
07:49 - So, if you were to add up these numbers, it would give you a $7,000 net present value.
07:55 - However, accounting for the discount rate, which assumes the loss of money due to increasing
08:01 - interest rates, our net present value is only $4,704.
08:05 - Although it's less than the $7,000 that we would have received if money didn't lose value,
08:09 - it's still greater than zero, which indicates that the vending machine is indeed a good
08:13 - investment.
08:15 - Okay, so here we have a Google Sheets laid out with the payments of a mortgage you would
08:21 - make if you were to buy a house.
08:24 - So, referring to a similar example, let's imagine we're buying a house for $150,000
08:28 - this time.
08:29 - So, you have a 20% down payment, which is $30,000, which leaves you with a payment of
08:34 - $120,000, which you're going to be paying off with a loan.
08:37 - So, let's say your loan principal is $120,000, you have a yearly interest rate of 10%.
08:43 - This means your yearly payment for a 20-year mortgage would come out to $13,896.
08:48 - So, as you can see here, over these 20 years, you're going to be paying off this mortgage
08:55 - with your yearly payments.
08:56 - So, the first, every year you pay off the exact same amount, however, the principal
09:02 - amount decreases.
09:03 - So, in the first year, you start with $120,000.
09:07 - After your first payment, you're left with $118,000, and so on and so forth, until you
09:11 - eventually reach zero at the end of your 20-year mortgage period.
09:15 - However, it's important to note the changes to the principal amount as time progresses.
09:21 - If you notice, from year zero to year one, our principal only decreased by just shy of
09:26 - $2,000, even though you're making a payment for almost $14,000.
09:30 - The reason for this is the majority of your payment is going towards paying off the yearly
09:34 - interest rate on your principal, which is 10% of $120,000, which is $12,000.
09:40 - So, of your $13,896, $12,000 is going towards the interest, and only $1,896 is going towards
09:48 - paying off your principal.
09:50 - This goes to show you how interest rates can actually end up costing you a lot of money.
09:55 - So, $120,000 loan ends up costing $277,904 by the end to pay off the principal and the
10:04 - interest.
10:05 - That means you're paying $157,940 on interest.
10:11 - Alright, so, what are capital and financial markets?
10:18 - What is capital finance and who provides it?
10:20 - And how do businesses and governments obtain financial capital through these markets?
10:25 - So, the financial market is a place where two or more people come together to exchange
10:30 - goods or services.
10:32 - They can be physical places, like a grocery store or supermarket, or virtual places, like
10:37 - for example, the Netflix subscription page.
10:41 - Although this is less obvious of a marketplace, it is still an area where two parties, the
10:46 - individual person subscription and Netflix, come together to exchange goods and services,
10:52 - or in this example, a Netflix subscription, which is a service.
10:56 - So, the importance of financial markets.
11:00 - Financial markets are vital for the growth of firms, as well as achieving individual
11:04 - consumers' desires.
11:06 - Many firms produce goods and services that individuals would not be able to acquire themselves.
11:10 - As a result, it's important for financial markets to exist, so consumers can have access
11:15 - to these goods.
11:16 - It's also important for firms.
11:18 - This is because, unless they're able to trade their goods and services, they won't be able
11:22 - to make returns on what they're producing and grow as a result.
11:26 - So, now we'll go over the stock and bond markets.
11:31 - So first of all, what is a stock?
11:34 - So a stock is a security that represents a portion of ownership in a company.
11:39 - So people can only purchase stocks from a public or private type of company.
11:44 - Public companies are companies that trade their stock on a public platform, or anybody
11:48 - can purchase it.
11:50 - Examples are Amazon, Apple, and Tesla.
11:53 - If you wanted to right now, you could go and purchase their stock.
11:58 - Private companies, on the other hand, are held by certain owners, typically the people
12:02 - who started the company.
12:03 - In certain situations, they may choose to sell their stock, but not on a public platform,
12:08 - only privately to maybe their friends and family.
12:11 - So what are stocks issued?
12:14 - Stocks are issued by companies to raise finances for their goals.
12:17 - These may be expansion, raising money for inventory, and so on.
12:21 - Stocks are also referred to as equity.
12:24 - And as many of you have seen in the Shark Tank show, we see the term equity thrown around.
12:30 - In this example, Kevin offers $400,000 for an $8.2 million valuation.
12:36 - So the company's total equity, or stock, is worth $8.2 million.
12:40 - And Kevin's offering $400,000, which represents 4.8% of that total equity, so he would be
12:47 - owning 4.85% of the total stock of that company.
12:51 - So now what is a bond?
12:53 - A bond is an instrument that represents a loan made by an investor, which is you and
12:58 - a borrower.
12:59 - So bonds can be issued by a variety of places, unlike stocks which are only issued by firms.
13:04 - Bonds can be issued by firms, governments, states, and other government-affiliated organizations.
13:11 - Bonds have four main features.
13:13 - Their issue price, which is what you buy it for.
13:16 - The face value, which includes the price you're buying it for, as well as the interest payments.
13:21 - The coupon rate, or the interest rate, which is the set of payments you'll be receiving
13:25 - over the course of the bond.
13:27 - The coupon date, which is when these payments will be made to you.
13:31 - And the maturity date, which is when a lifetime of the bond is expended and the issue price
13:36 - is returned to you.
13:38 - So bonds are used typically to fund projects for these organizations.
13:43 - They only last for a certain period of time, as determined by the maturity rate when the
13:49 - bond is issued, and they either have fixed or variable payments.
13:54 - Something interesting about bonds is that they're inversely related to interest rates
13:58 - in the market.
13:59 - This is because as interest rates rise, the lower coupon rate of the bonds become less
14:05 - desirable.
14:06 - As a result, bond issuers lower their price.
14:11 - An example of a government-funded project could be developing infrastructure, such as
14:15 - buildings, schools, paving roads, and so on.
14:19 - If the government doesn't already have enough funds to do this project, they may issue bonds
14:23 - to raise capital and pursue these projects.
14:27 - So the differences between stocks and bonds.
14:30 - So typically stocks are more risky.
14:33 - This is due to the volatility of the stock market, resulting in companies' values appreciating
14:37 - and depreciating.
14:39 - Additionally, stocks are only issued by firms or companies.
14:43 - Stocks also give you ownership over a company, and you get paid in the form of dividends
14:48 - and appreciation in the value of the company.
14:51 - Dividends are when companies may choose to offer you some money that they make from their
14:56 - profits.
14:57 - And appreciation is when the total value of the company rises.
15:00 - As a result, when you purchase a stock, for say for example when the company stock is
15:04 - worth $100 and it appreciates to $120, you make money off of that $20 appreciation.
15:10 - Additionally, stocks give you ownership over a company, and in some situations will give
15:14 - you decision-making power.
15:17 - So now bonds.
15:18 - Bonds are seen as less risky because they have fixed payments, which are determined
15:22 - when the bond is purchased, and once they mature, you get your initial payment back.
15:30 - Bonds are issued also by firms and governments, along with other organizations.
15:36 - Bonds are in the form of debt, not ownership.
15:38 - So when you purchase a bond, the person that you purchase the bond from will be making
15:42 - you payments.
15:43 - Furthermore, bonds don't give you any decision-making power since they're only debt and not ownership.
15:49 - We can see the risk between bonds and stocks in this example.
15:54 - So here, the stocks are represented by the dark blue line, whereas the bonds are represented
15:58 - by the light purple.
16:00 - The stock prices are very volatile as they're swinging up and down cyclically almost, whereas
16:05 - bonds are on a steady, much less volatile growth rate.
16:09 - This represents how stocks are much more volatile, and when, at certain dates, if you choose
16:13 - to sell a stock, you may make a negative return, whereas if you choose, well, bonds you can't
16:18 - sell.
16:19 - But once your bond reaches a maturity, you're almost guaranteed to make profits, unless
16:22 - the company or organization that you purchase the bond from defaults or goes bankrupt.
16:30 - So how do we value stocks on any asset in general?
16:34 - Well there's two main factors that we have to include when trying to value a stock or
16:39 - bond or any asset for that matter.
16:41 - The expected cash flows and the risk associated with the value.
16:45 - As we discussed earlier, cash flows are the total revenues we'll be making, along with
16:50 - the sunken costs of bursting an asset.
16:54 - And risk.
16:55 - Risk can be represented with the chance for financial losses or the chance that a company
17:00 - even goes bankrupt and you lose your value.
17:03 - Okay, so stock valuation.
17:06 - There is a lot of uncertainty when valuing a stock, and part of this is due to the fact
17:11 - that there's so many different ways to value a stock.
17:13 - For example, there's the discounted cash flow method, which we'll be looking into next.
17:18 - There's the constant growth divided by dividend discount method, and there's also techniques
17:22 - called comparables, which we'll also be discussing, such as price to earnings, price to books,
17:27 - and price to sales.
17:29 - As a result, there's no standard convention to measure a stock, and when people are comparing
17:33 - stocks, it's best to use the most information you have available to you and try and do all
17:38 - these techniques, which is, of course, unviable in the real world though.
17:42 - So, the discounted cash flow method.
17:45 - Discounted cash flow method is similar to what we discussed in the previous section,
17:49 - where we take all the expected cash flows for an asset, including the sunken costs and
17:54 - the revenues that it slightly generate in the future, and discount these values, meaning
17:59 - we adjust the value of money in accordance with macroeconomic features like inflation
18:05 - and so on to ensure that the future value of money is converted to the present value
18:10 - of money.
18:11 - So, what are the pros of this technique?
18:14 - Theoretically, this is the most sound method if the analyst is confident in their assumptions
18:19 - and forecasts.
18:20 - Additionally, it's not significantly influenced by temporary market conditions or non-economic
18:26 - factors.
18:27 - Like if the industry is suffering from a temporary lack of resources, this technique ensures
18:33 - that those factors are overcome when calculating the value.
18:37 - And this is especially useful when a company you're valuing is in an industry where there's
18:43 - no other competitors or very limited competitors, so that way there's limited or no comparable
18:48 - information.
18:49 - As a result, you only base your forecasts off the individual company.
18:54 - The cons of this technique are that it can vary over a wide range of values, because
18:59 - the predictions are based on forecasts which are likely to be inaccurate.
19:03 - Additionally, it's very time intensive compared to the other evaluation techniques which we'll
19:08 - discuss later.
19:09 - And additionally, forecasting future performance is very difficult since it requires lots of
19:14 - statistical tools, and again, it is likely to be inaccurate or imprecise.
19:20 - So valuation frameworks, we'll be looking at comps now.
19:23 - So what are comps?
19:25 - Comps are also called comparables or multiples, and it is a valuation technique that is based
19:31 - on comparing companies within an industry.
19:35 - It involves using metrics such as price to earnings, price to books, and other relevant
19:39 - ratios to that of similar companies in the same industry.
19:43 - The rationale behind using comps lies in the principle that companies within the same industry
19:47 - tend to have similar financial and operational characteristics due to shared market and economic
19:52 - factors.
19:54 - By evaluating the valuation of a company against its peers, investors can gain insights into
19:58 - its performance within the industry and whether it's over, under, or fairly valued.
20:05 - So the two most popular forms of comps are price to earnings ratio and something called
20:10 - enterprise value to EDITDA or EBITDA.
20:17 - So these are examples of certain types of comps.
20:20 - We have price to earnings, price to sales, enterprise value to earning before interest,
20:25 - tax, and appreciation, price to cash flow, and price to earnings.
20:29 - The reason these are better than discounting cash flow in terms of time is that their ratios
20:33 - so they can be calculated very quickly.
20:36 - All you have to do is go to the financial documents of a company, look at their numbers
20:40 - of their reporting, and calculate them, which allows for swift and easy comparison between
20:44 - companies within the same industry.
20:47 - Alright, in this section we'll be going over business strategy and any of the financial
20:52 - documents related to it.
20:54 - So first, what is business strategy?
20:56 - Well, it's a plan of action or a policy designed to achieve the major or overall aim of a company.
21:02 - So it's the time to develop a coherent economic strategy and the plans to ensure the future
21:06 - success of the company in both its goals and financial success.
21:11 - So one key aspect of the business strategy is the mission statement.
21:15 - The mission statement is the summary of the aims and the values of a company.
21:20 - The key elements of a mission statement are the purpose, the target audience, an explanation
21:24 - of the business, how the business is unique, and the values that the business has.
21:29 - And it has to do all of these things in just a couple sentences.
21:32 - So let's look at a couple examples.
21:35 - Here we have Microsoft, and their business statement is to empower every person and every
21:39 - organization on the planet to achieve more.
21:43 - We have Honda, maintaining a global viewpoint, we are dedicated to supplying products of
21:48 - the highest quality yet at a reasonable price for worldwide customer satisfaction.
21:53 - And Walmart, to save people money so that they can live better.
21:57 - Across these three statements, there's common features.
22:01 - One, they're short, two, they're easy to remember, and three, they showcase the core
22:06 - values and missions of these companies.
22:09 - Okay, so the next part about a company analysis.
22:13 - There's various tools that companies include to create their business statement.
22:18 - And one of these principle tools is a SWOT analysis.
22:21 - A SWOT analysis helps a company position themselves and understand where they are in the marketplace
22:26 - against their competitors.
22:28 - There are four key elements of SWOT analysis, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats,
22:34 - which thus produce the name SWOT.
22:35 - So the strengths of a company are its competitive advantage, the assets that it had that are
22:40 - proprietary and products that are performing well.
22:44 - These are the strengths because they are unique features of a company that other competitions
22:47 - don't have.
22:49 - The weaknesses of a company are things that they lack that their competitors have, things
22:53 - that their competitors do better and any resource limitations that a company may be experiencing.
23:00 - So strengths and weaknesses are within the company and its operations.
23:04 - Then we have opportunities and threats.
23:07 - Threats are new legislature which threatens a company's operations, any new emerging competition,
23:14 - and changes to consumer attitudes and opinions.
23:18 - Opportunities are technologies that a company can integrate to improve its processes, emerging
23:23 - press and media which can help a company generate any publicity, and underserved markets that
23:28 - a company can integrate themselves into.
23:30 - Threats and opportunities are not directly involved in the company and are external and
23:34 - can be affecting the company over time.
23:37 - So here we have a bit more of a detailed explanation of what strengths and weaknesses are.
23:41 - So strengths are the internal attributes and resources of a company that propel the company
23:45 - towards success.
23:46 - It represents the area where your organization outperforms others, evident by both your competitors
23:52 - and your customers.
23:55 - Weaknesses are the facets that hinder favorable outcomes for your business.
23:58 - They pinpoint areas that require improvements, shedding light on where your company falls
24:02 - short compared to its competitors.
24:06 - Opportunities encompass external elements that can be leveraged to your advantage.
24:10 - These are prevailing market trends that, when capitalized upon using your strengths, can
24:13 - enhance revenue and provide a competitive edge.
24:17 - Threats denote external factors that jeopardize your organization's success.
24:21 - These encompass advantages held by competitors.
24:23 - To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to employers' strengths strategically.
24:27 - Swat analysis, when used, can help a company understand where it is now in its industry
24:33 - and what the future holds and how the company can progress itself in a beneficial way.
24:39 - One more tool that a business can use to help it understand the importance of certain products
24:44 - or services it sells is the BCG matrix.
24:48 - The BCG matrix, otherwise known as the Boston Consulting Group matrix, is a business analysis
24:53 - tool that helps organizations assess their product portfolio's performance and potential.
24:59 - As you can see on the diagram, there are four different categories, stars, cash cows, question
25:05 - marks and dogs, and you can categorize products depending on their market growth rate and
25:10 - their relative market share.
25:12 - Stars, these are products with high market shares that are in fast-growing markets.
25:19 - They have the potential to generate significant profits due to their position in this industry.
25:23 - So if a company dominates 90% of the market share for a niche that is growing very fast,
25:29 - the product that they're selling is likely to be a star.
25:32 - Cash cows are products that have high market shares in markets that aren't growing so fast.
25:38 - While they may not have as much growth potential, they generate steady cash flow, which is often
25:44 - desirable for businesses.
25:45 - So similar to stars, but they don't have the future potential and instead they're making
25:50 - money right now.
25:52 - Question marks are products that companies may have low market share in, however the
25:56 - market is likely to expand in the future.
25:58 - They require consideration as to whether a company should invest in it to develop its
26:03 - market share and potentially create it into a star or to let it go and become a dog.
26:09 - And dogs are products that have a low market share and a market growth in a market that
26:13 - isn't growing.
26:14 - They won't generate significant profits for the company and if a company needs to reduce
26:19 - some of its services that it's offering, the dogs are the first to go.
26:26 - The BCG Matrix can help a company allocate its resources effectively by suggesting strategies
26:31 - for products or services that fall into each specific quadrant.
26:36 - And the last strategic business tool we'll talk about is Porter's Generic Strategies.
26:42 - Porter's Generic Strategies are a set of strategic approaches developed by Michael
26:45 - Porter, as the name suggests, to help businesses understand where they stand in the industry
26:50 - and to help them gain a competitive advantage.
26:53 - So again, there are four quadrants in this diagram.
26:59 - There's cost leadership, differentiation, cost focus, and differentiation focus.
27:04 - So cost leadership is a strategy that focuses on becoming the lowest cost producer in an
27:10 - industry.
27:11 - This is achieved by economies of scale, efficient operations, and cost controls.
27:16 - This can attract a wide consumer customer base and potentially deter new entrants from
27:20 - the industry.
27:21 - Then we have differentiation.
27:23 - Differentiation aims to create a unique or distinctive product unlike others on the market.
27:28 - And this can be achieved through unique product design, branding, or even customer service.
27:34 - By offering something that's valuable and unique, companies can often charge premium
27:38 - prices and customers will be willing to pay.
27:41 - And then as we move to the bottom, there are the focus or niche strategies in the niche
27:45 - market.
27:46 - These strategies often involve concentrating efforts on a specific market or a specific
27:51 - segment.
27:52 - This can be done either through cost focus or through differentiation focus, which means
27:56 - becoming the lowest cost leader in a niche and offering a uniquely tailored product in
28:01 - a niche respectively.
28:02 - By focusing on smaller specialized markets, companies can build stronger relationships
28:06 - with their customers and it's much easier to maintain these relationships.
28:11 - By choosing one of these generic strategies, businesses can align their operations, marketing
28:15 - efforts, and resource allocations to create a sustainable competitive advantage.
28:22 - So now we'll be looking at the three main financial statements that all companies need
28:27 - to report or financial documents rather.
28:30 - So we have the statement of profit or loss, the statement of financial position and the
28:34 - cash flow forecast.
28:36 - It's important to note that these documents do have different names that they're referred
28:40 - to as I've indicated some of the popular other forms in parentheses.
28:45 - So if you do go on the internet and you come across an income statement or profit or loss
28:49 - statement, please do know that they're the same thing.
28:52 - So each of these statements has a different purpose, which we'll be exploring soon.
28:56 - And when combined together, they provide an in-depth look at the through the lens of finances
29:01 - and performance at how a company is performing and whether its stock is good.
29:07 - And also keep in mind that all publicly traded companies need to report these three documents
29:12 - to ensure transparency with the public and their investors, whereas private companies
29:16 - don't need to report this.
29:18 - Also note that in these documents, any negative numbers or losses will be represented with
29:23 - parentheses around them.
29:25 - In earlier examples, I use the color red.
29:27 - However, in financial documents, it's important to know all negative numbers are in parentheses.
29:33 - All right.
29:35 - So first we have the statement of profit or loss.
29:38 - The statement of profit or loss is a financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs,
29:42 - and expenses of a company over a period of time.
29:45 - So just to start with, all of these financial documents have this opening section.
29:50 - It will of course include the title, the company, and what type of financial document it is.
29:56 - And more importantly, the period of time that is coming from.
29:59 - So in this example, we have the end of the year at whatever year.
30:04 - Okay.
30:05 - So the statement of profit or loss is also known as the statement of operations, statement
30:09 - of financial results or income, the earning statement, the expense statement, income statement,
30:15 - and so on.
30:16 - It's important to compare this profit and loss statement over time to see changes within
30:21 - a company.
30:22 - So this example, we only have it for one year, but investors typically look at several years
30:26 - and compare it on a horizontal analysis, which we'll look at later, to see the growth of
30:31 - a company over time.
30:34 - So whenever we're looking at this document, it's important to start from the top.
30:37 - So we look at the sales revenue, and as we go, we slowly reduce the total sales revenue
30:43 - until we receive the retained profit.
30:46 - So starting at costs of sales, this includes the cost of manufacturing goods and the costs
30:52 - through which you would have to sell it.
30:54 - This includes lighting at the store and so on.
30:56 - This leads you to gross profit.
30:58 - Then after expenses, you get your profits before interest in tax.
31:02 - After paying interest, you get profits before tax.
31:05 - After paying your taxes, you get profit for your period.
31:08 - So this is essentially all the surplus that a company has left over.
31:12 - Then you pay your dividends to your shareholders, and this leads the retained profit for the
31:16 - company.
31:17 - So it's important to note that this is for a profit-making entity.
31:22 - Even non-profit-making entities do report these statements.
31:25 - However, in place of profit, they use the term surplus, since they aren't, well, for
31:31 - profit, right?
31:35 - So the statement of financial position.
31:37 - This statement's a bit longer, so we'll look at it in two parts, assets and liabilities.
31:42 - But essentially this statement says, at the end of a financial period, where do you as
31:46 - a company stand?
31:48 - So the first half, the assets.
31:50 - So again, looking from the top, we have the name of the company, title of the document,
31:55 - and the period that it's reporting for.
31:57 - So in this section, we look at the assets, and assets are split into non-current and
32:02 - current assets.
32:04 - So non-current assets are assets that a company will be holding for a period greater than
32:08 - a year.
32:09 - This includes things like the factory that it's built on, any of the technical equipment
32:13 - they have, and so on.
32:15 - Current assets, on the other hand, are assets that a company will hold for less than a period
32:21 - of a year.
32:22 - This includes things like cash, debtors, and stock.
32:26 - So when you calculate the total value of non-current assets, you get 800 here, and current assets
32:31 - is a 1100.
32:33 - So your total assets add up to 1900.
32:37 - One thing that you may notice is accumulated depreciation, and it's in parentheses, and
32:42 - it's a negative factor.
32:43 - Although it's beyond the scope of this course, I'll give you a quick look at what depreciation
32:48 - is.
32:49 - It's an accounting technique used by companies to reduce their overall assets, which can
32:53 - help them in terms of tax breaks and so on.
32:56 - But yeah, when you add your non-current assets and your current assets, you get your total
33:00 - assets of 1900.
33:03 - Now liabilities, again, liabilities are split into current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
33:09 - Current liabilities are liabilities that a company will hold for a period less than a
33:12 - year.
33:13 - And non-current are liabilities that a company will hold for a period greater than a year.
33:18 - Things like bank overdraft, which are essentially drawing from a bank account until it gets
33:23 - to a negative point, is a current liability.
33:26 - Trade predators is when a company is trading with another company, and the person you're
33:31 - trading with allows you to pay later, essentially like an IOU.
33:36 - And we also have short-term loans, which will be paid back in a period less than a year.
33:41 - And these add up to your total current liabilities.
33:43 - Other non-current liabilities are just long-term loans, which you would take out from the bank.
33:48 - And these add up to your total liabilities.
33:51 - Your net assets are your total assets minus your total liabilities.
33:54 - So your total assets are 1900, and your total liabilities are 800.
33:58 - So 1900 minus 800 gives you 1100, which is your net assets.
34:03 - And an important calculation to know to see if you've done the financial position correct
34:09 - is to take your assets and equate them to liabilities plus shareholder equity.
34:13 - If this comes out equal, then you've done it right.
34:16 - Shareholder equity is essentially the share capital, the value of your shares, and the
34:21 - retained earnings of a company for the period.
34:23 - So yeah, that's your statement of financial position.
34:27 - And now we have the cash flow forecast.
34:29 - The cash flow forecast is for a shorter period of time, and it talks about all the money
34:34 - going in and out of a company for, in this case, three months.
34:40 - So yeah, it allows advisors to assess the individual inflows and outflows of a company
34:45 - to determine how important certain things in the company are and how expensive they
34:49 - are and how they can be cut down to improve the total net cash flow of a company.
34:55 - It also allows the company, it also allows for a month by month comparison to see the
34:58 - growing effects of the company's operations.
35:02 - So as you see here in January, the opening balance is 800.
35:05 - However, the total cash outflows, which are 306, are greater than the inflows, which are
35:09 - 300.
35:10 - And as a result, the closing balance decreases by 6, 6 million.
35:15 - So you have a closing balance of 2 million.
35:17 - And we see this negative cash flow going over a period of three months, which allows us
35:23 - to see that operating at this state for this company has negative effects and then suggests
35:29 - that some outflows need to be decreased or inflows need to be increased.
35:33 - Otherwise, companies may need to take out other, incorporate other forms of finances.
35:39 - So the importance of these forms, these three forms, as I stated earlier, need to be made
35:44 - public for publicly traded companies.
35:47 - It's important that companies ensure transparency with their investors and with the public so
35:53 - that investors can make informed decisions whether they should invest in the company.
35:58 - These documents are also important for people within the company to ensure that to create
36:03 - calculations like return on equity or ROE.
36:06 - And you can only do that by comparing across these documents or cross referencing.
36:12 - So yeah, even now you can search up a certain publicly traded company and find these financial
36:17 - documents on the internet.
36:18 - However, you won't be able to do so with private companies.
36:23 - So now we'll be looking at how to analyze these financial statements that we've just
36:27 - discussed.
36:28 - So there's three techniques that we can use.
36:30 - You can use ratios, a horizontal analysis, and a common size technique.
36:36 - So first we'll go over ratios, which are, in my opinion, the simplest way and the quickest
36:40 - way to analyze.
36:42 - So there's four types of ratios, profitability ratios, which measure your return on investment,
36:48 - your liquidity ratios, which measure how easily you can move your money around, activity ratios,
36:53 - which are representation of your day to day operations, and leverage ratios, which represent
36:58 - how well you can utilize debt.
37:02 - So we have profitability ratios.
37:05 - Profitability ratios are financial indicators used to evaluate a company's ability to generate
37:09 - profits relative to its revenue, assets, and equity.
37:13 - Key profitability ratios include the gross profit margin, as you can see on screen, which
37:17 - measures profit after deducting production costs or cost of goods sold, and the net profit
37:22 - margin, which assesses overall profit after all expenses.
37:26 - We also have return on assets and return on equity, which are common ratios that show
37:30 - how efficiently a company generates profits from its assets and shareholder equity, respectively.
37:36 - These ratios help investors and stakeholders gauge the company's profitability and its
37:41 - effectiveness in turning revenue into earnings.
37:44 - So as you can see, I have the formulas for each of these profitability ratios listed
37:47 - on screen, and all of this information can obviously be found from three financial documents.
37:54 - Next we have liquidity ratios.
37:57 - Liquidity ratios are a financial metrics that assess a company's ability to meet its short-term
38:01 - financial obligations.
38:02 - They measure the firm's ability to convert assets into cash quickly to recover or cover
38:09 - immediate liabilities.
38:11 - Common liquidity ratios include the current ratio, which divides the current assets by
38:15 - current liabilities, and the quick ratio, which excludes less liquid assets like inventory.
38:21 - These ratios provide insights into a company's financial health and its capacity to handle
38:25 - unexpected expenses or downturns.
38:28 - High liquidity ratios generally indicate better short-term financial stability and flexibility,
38:33 - however they aren't the ultimate analysis technique for liquidity.
38:39 - Activity ratios are also known as asset utilization ratios, and they analyze how efficiently a
38:47 - company manages to use its assets to generate revenue.
38:50 - They provide insights into how well a company utilizes its resources and operations.
38:55 - For example, we have inventory turnover, which measures how quickly inventory is sold and
38:59 - replenished, and things like average collection period.
39:04 - Activity ratios help businesses optimize their operations, manage working capital, and identify
39:09 - areas where improvements can lead to increased productivity and profitability.
39:13 - Finally, we have debt leverage ratios.
39:17 - Debt ratios are financial metrics that evaluate a company's level of debt in relation to its
39:21 - equity or assets.
39:23 - These ratios offer insights into a company's financial leverage and risk.
39:28 - Common debt ratios include the debt-to-asset ratio, which measures debt relative to the
39:32 - total assets a company has.
39:34 - This ratio helps assess the company's ability to handle its debt obligations, and also provides
39:39 - valuable information for investors and creditors regarding the firm's financial stability
39:44 - and its transfer risk.
39:47 - Alright, so there's nuances to these ratios.
39:52 - Although these ratios are super simple and easy to calculate, they aren't that useful
39:56 - when you're comparing firms across industries.
39:59 - So for example, we have Walmart and Honda.
40:02 - If we take the example of the liquidity ratios with the quick ratio, you can't compare Honda
40:08 - and Walmart.
40:09 - It's likely that one of the companies will have very different styles of inventory, and
40:13 - the way they process their equipment is very different.
40:16 - However, these ratios are useful when you're comparing companies within the same industry
40:21 - in the same position.
40:23 - Alright, so now we can go through a quick simplified version of a consolidated income
40:30 - statement and all these financial documents to calculate two ratios, the gross profit
40:35 - margin and the net profit margin for Tesla.
40:38 - So I got this data from the Wall Street Journal, and it's just a consolidated income statement
40:42 - of Tesla with all this information here.
40:45 - So to calculate the gross profit margin, I have the formula right here.
40:49 - So it's the revenues minus the cost of goods sold divided by the total revenues.
40:53 - So using Excel, we can use the minus function to take the revenues, which is right here,
40:59 - and subtract it from the cost of goods sold, which is right here.
41:02 - And this gives us 20,853.
41:05 - And now we can use the divide function to divide this value by the total revenues, which
41:11 - is the formula right here.
41:14 - And this gives us the gross profit margin ratio of 0.255, and so on.
41:20 - And now we can do the same thing with the net profit margin.
41:22 - But this is much more simple.
41:23 - This is just the net income divided by revenues.
41:26 - So we take the divide function, and we look for the net income, which is right here.
41:33 - And you take this, and you divide it by the revenues, which is right here again.
41:38 - And using Excel, we can calculate it to be 0.15446.
41:42 - So this is a super simplified example.
41:44 - The information on this Excel sheet is very basic.
41:49 - In reality, when you're calculating some of the other ratios, you're going to need to
41:52 - cross reference these financial documents, because lots of the information is located
41:57 - on the cash flow forecast, some is reporting the income statement, and so on.
42:02 - So as a result, it becomes a lot more complicated.
42:05 - But if you have access to all the other files, which you should for publicly traded companies,
42:09 - you'll be able to do these calculations no problem.
42:14 - The next technique is horizontal analysis or trend analysis.
42:18 - So horizontal analysis of financial statements involves comparing financial ratios and benchmarks
42:24 - or any item over a number of accounting periods.
42:28 - This method is also known as trend analysis.
42:30 - So horizontal analysis allows the assessment of relative changes in different aspects of
42:35 - the financial statements to be seen over time.
42:39 - So let's look at this example.
42:43 - One thing to notice when you're reading these statements over time is that the most recent
42:48 - years represented on the left most column and the most and the oldest years on the right
42:52 - most column, which kind of goes against our left to right reading style in English.
42:57 - So it's important to keep that in mind.
42:59 - But if we look at the numbers, we see a growth in the sales, a growth in the cost of sales,
43:04 - a growth in profit and so on.
43:07 - So this can be calculated.
43:08 - So the change, the numerical change can be calculated and listed in this column.
43:14 - And the percentage change can be listed here.
43:17 - The percentage change is calculated by taking the difference and dividing it by the overall
43:22 - amount.
43:23 - So that's also called the year over year change.
43:27 - So returning to our consolidated income statement for Tesla that we saw in the previous example,
43:32 - we can see the same changes happening over time.
43:35 - So the leftmost column is the most recent year, which is 2022, and the rightmost column
43:39 - is 2018.
43:41 - So this records data for Tesla over the course of five years.
43:45 - Keep in mind that some of this data happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have
43:49 - skewed results.
43:51 - So that shows you that it's important to realize that macroeconomic effects like a pandemic
43:57 - or other industrial shocks can affect this data.
44:01 - But in large, it's not that big of a contribution, at least to Tesla.
44:05 - So if we look, we see a growth in sales revenue.
44:08 - So from 21,000, 24,000, 31,000, and then rapid growth from 2020 to 2022, with 20,000 growth
44:18 - and then 30,000 growth.
44:21 - At the same processes can be seen across various other factors or various other items.
44:26 - And this goes to show you how this horizontal statement can be used to analyze growth over
44:31 - time, even with Tesla.
44:34 - The last tool we'll be discussing in this section is common size analysis, which is
44:39 - a financial state.
44:41 - The last technique we'll be discussing in this section is common size analysis.
44:46 - Common size financial statements show each line item expressed as a percentage of a base
44:50 - figure within the statement, and it's used for vertical analysis.
44:54 - So common size financial statements help to analyze and compare a company's performance
44:58 - over several periods.
45:00 - The common size percentages can subsequently be used to compare those of competitors and
45:05 - determine how a company is performing relative to the rest of the industry.
45:09 - A common size income statement is an income statement in which each line item is expressed
45:14 - as a percentage of the value of revenue or sales.
45:17 - A common size balance sheet is a balance sheet that displays both a numeric value and relative
45:21 - percentage for total assets.
45:23 - So in the following example, we'll be looking over a common size statement for an income
45:28 - statement or balance sheet.
45:31 - Okay, so here we have a generic example of what one would look like.
45:35 - As you can see, we have the normal side of a balance sheet or a statement of financial
45:40 - position, except one more column is added that expresses everything as percentages.
45:46 - In this example, you would think percentages aren't too helpful, and you'd be right.
45:51 - And that's because the numbers here are very straightforward.
45:53 - The total assets are 100,000, which makes 100%.
45:57 - And all these numbers are very straightforward.
45:59 - However, in a situation where numbers are much more miscellaneous and intricate, these
46:04 - percentages help to clarify and watch more information.
46:08 - Here this is extremely helpful because it can show us what percent of our assets, for
46:12 - example, our current assets are in which form.
46:15 - So in this example, for our current assets, the majority is in the form of total cash
46:19 - and inventory, whereas the rest is in the form of prepaid expenses and accounts receivables.
46:23 - This can suggest that the company may need to invest its total cash into other assets
46:30 - that can generate revenue, and it may have an inventory issue, turning inventory into
46:35 - actual revenue.
46:37 - And if we look at our non-current assets, the majority of our assets are in our plan,
46:41 - property and equipment, whereas very little is in our goodwill.
46:44 - This can help us identify what value certain parts of our business bring and what parts
46:48 - aren't as helpful.
46:50 - So in the non-current example, we see how we have so much value in our equipment, our
46:55 - property, and our plant, whereas the brand name and value, which is goodwill, isn't
46:59 - that strong.
47:01 - This can also help us identify which parts of our liabilities are the greatest and which
47:05 - parts are the weakest, and how we can take future steps to address these and prevent
47:10 - any other issues from rising.
47:12 - This same thing can be seen for other forms of statements like the income statement,
47:16 - which I mentioned earlier, but it's essentially the same thing just in another financial statement.
47:22 - All right.
47:25 - So let's say you have the opportunity to install solar panels on your house.
47:30 - The solar panel company says it's going to cost you $10,000 to install solar panels.
47:35 - But they say in the long run, you're going to be able to save money.
47:39 - Should you make the investment?
47:40 - Well, in this class, we're going to be in this section, we're going to be talking about
47:44 - capital budgeting.
47:46 - So what is capital budgeting?
47:48 - Why do we do it?
47:49 - And how is it done?
47:51 - And with these tools, we can answer whether we should make the investment for the solar
47:55 - panels.
47:56 - So first, what is capital budgeting?
47:59 - Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating and selecting long term investment projects
48:03 - like solar panels that involve significant financial outlays.
48:07 - It's a decision making processes for businesses and individuals to determine which projects
48:12 - are worth pursuing based on their potential to generate returns or benefits over an extended
48:17 - period.
48:18 - Capital budgeting helps organizations and individuals allocate their financial resources
48:22 - effectively, maximizing the value of investments and minimizing the risk of making poor choices.
48:29 - It's a systematic approach that considers not only the immediate costs and returns,
48:33 - but also the long term impact on financial performance and overall strategic goals of
48:38 - an individual or business.
48:41 - Okay, so first of all, why do companies even make investments in fixed assets?
48:46 - Well, investments can increase capacity, they can overcome some regulations, they are innovative,
48:53 - which can give companies a unique advantage.
48:55 - And there's so many other reasons.
48:58 - But why is capital budgeting important for valuation?
49:02 - Capital budgeting is important for several reasons, but I'll give you three main reasons.
49:06 - First of all, it helps the resource allocation.
49:09 - There's limited financial resources and capital budgeting can help ensure companies focus
49:13 - on the most promising investments.
49:16 - It also helps for long term planning.
49:18 - This is because it allows companies to plan for the future by considering the effects of
49:22 - their investment using tools that we'll discuss later, over an extended period and manage
49:26 - risk while maximizing returns.
49:29 - And it also considers the time value of money, again, which we'll discuss further.
49:33 - But capital budgeting considers the time value of money, recognizing that a dollar today
49:37 - is worth more than a dollar in the future.
49:40 - This also ensures that cash flow predictions are properly discounted.
49:44 - Okay, so how do companies pay for investments?
49:48 - They pay for it in three ways using cash flow, debt, and equity.
49:54 - So before we continue, there's two more concepts you need to understand before we're able to
49:59 - discuss capital budgeting and how to actually consider it.
50:02 - Internal Rate of Return, or IRR for short, and Cost of Capital.
50:07 - The Internal Rate of Return, or IRR, is a finance term that helps us assess how lucrative
50:12 - an investment or project could be.
50:14 - IRR is the annual growth that an investment is expected to make.
50:18 - If the IRR is higher than what you could earn from a safe investment, like a bank deposit
50:23 - or investing in some safe stocks, then the project might be worth the risk.
50:28 - In short, IRR helps us decide if a business idea is a good investment.
50:34 - So the steps of capital budgeting.
50:36 - First, a project proposal is developed.
50:39 - This involves either individuals or businesses looking at an opportunity to make an investment
50:44 - and thinking it's a good idea.
50:46 - Then management reviews and prioritizes projects based on their economic viability.
50:52 - So after looking at the potential cash flow projections, management will either decide
50:56 - if an investment is positive or negative for the company and thus decide to prioritize
51:01 - or ignore it.
51:03 - Then funds are allocated on these projects to ensure the development and the results
51:07 - are tracked to see if the projections are accurate.
51:10 - If projections are inaccurate, funds are either removed, reduced, or increased.
51:16 - After the investment is completed, companies can reflect on the process and decide whether
51:21 - future similar investments should be made.
51:25 - So Capital Cash Flows.
51:28 - The value of an initial investment is equal to the cost of the new asset plus the installation's
51:34 - cost associated with the new asset minus the after-tax proceeds from selling the old asset.
51:40 - Keep in mind the after-tax proceeds from selling an old asset is equal to the sale price minus
51:45 - the tax on capital gain, which is a bit advanced from this course.
51:49 - But all you need to understand is that that is considered when calculating the price of
51:52 - the initial investment.
51:57 - So capital budgeting results in changes in working capital.
52:00 - If a current asset increases in value, it's a use of working capital.
52:04 - If current liabilities increase, it's a source of working capital.
52:08 - That means current assets are cash, or inventory, which are uses of capital, and liabilities
52:14 - are things like loans, which are sources of working capital.
52:18 - An increase in networking capital means it's a source of cash for the company, and a decrease
52:22 - is a use of cash.
52:25 - So capital budgeting are the three main methods that we use to decide whether we should invest
52:30 - our payback period, which we'll discuss next, net present value, which we've discussed
52:34 - earlier, and IRR, which we've all just discussed.
52:38 - So payback period, it's a very basic concept, and it essentially discusses how long it takes
52:43 - for a company to recoup its investments on a fixed asset.
52:47 - So in this example, we have a Ford factory.
52:51 - Initially it costs $5,000 to invest in this Ford factory.
52:54 - However, as the years go on, it generates positive cash flows.
52:59 - So payback period essentially looks at how long it takes for the company to generate,
53:04 - to receive a net positive cash flow.
53:07 - And as you can see, initially the cash flows, the cumulative cash flow is negative until
53:11 - year four, when it finally breaks positive.
53:14 - Okay, so now let's return back to our example.
53:18 - Our solar panel costs $10,000.
53:21 - Should we make the investment?
53:24 - So using capital budgeting techniques, we can predict the cash flows.
53:28 - So the cash flows over the years are $2,000, $2,500, $3,500, $4,000, and $4,500, with an
53:35 - initial cost of $10,000.
53:37 - Should we install these panels?
53:38 - Well, if you look at the cost of capital, which is 12%, that means any other investment
53:44 - we could invest in would generate $1,200 in net present value.
53:49 - If our investment on the solar panels is greater than our other cost of capital, then it's
53:55 - a good investment.
53:57 - So using discounting our cash flows, we can find a value.
54:00 - We find that the value of the solar panels, the net present value of the solar panels
54:06 - is $1,219, which is greater than the value of, which is greater than our cost of capital.
54:15 - So here we can see how we calculate our net present value and how it shifts based on our
54:20 - discount rate and our cash flows.
54:23 - So this Excel function is set up so that the discount rate is called percent, which is
54:29 - our cost of capital, and our cash flows are accounted for.
54:33 - And you can do this by typing equals NPV, selecting the discount, comma, and selecting
54:39 - our cash flows, which yields the same number here and here.
54:44 - So if we wanted to adjust our factors to see how it would be in different scenarios, we
54:49 - can change these numbers and see how it would work.
54:52 - So if our discount rate was instead of 12%, 20%, you can see how our net present value
54:57 - has decreased.
54:59 - This suggests that other investments which have higher, which are better cost of capital
55:04 - could have been a better investment than investing in these solar panels.
55:07 - However, if we decrease our cost of capital to something like 5%, we see the net present
55:13 - value increases even greater.
55:16 - This shows how different costs of capital can affect the net present value of our investment
55:21 - by comparing alternative investments.
55:24 - Additionally, we can look at how cash flow affects the net present value.
55:29 - If our initial cash flow is 20,000 instead of 10,000, thus essentially making the cost
55:33 - was double, our net present value decreases significantly.
55:37 - This shows how the price of investment can also affect the value.
55:42 - And that increasing our cash flows significantly increases our net present value.
55:49 - Alright, in this section, we'll be talking about macroeconomics.
55:54 - So first of all, what is macroeconomics?
55:57 - Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the overall behavior of an economy
56:01 - focusing on large scale factors like economic growth, inflation, unemployment, and national
56:07 - income.
56:08 - It examines how policies and events impact the economy as a whole rather than individuals
56:13 - such as individual businesses or individual markets.
56:17 - Some of the key factors in macroeconomics are the size of the economy, economic growth,
56:23 - government policy, fiscal policy, monetary policy, inflation, and international trade.
56:28 - Most of these which we'll touch upon.
56:31 - So one thing that we should understand is the business cycle.
56:35 - The business cycle is very intertwined with economics.
56:40 - Everything is cyclical.
56:41 - So the business cycle, also known as the economic cycle, is the recurring pattern of fluctuations
56:47 - and an economy's overall activity over time.
56:50 - It can be divided into four main phases, as you guys can see in this diagram.
56:56 - In this example, it starts with the trough or the lowest point.
56:59 - So the trough is the lowest point in the business cycle.
57:02 - At this point, economic activity is at its lowest and economic conditions are the worst.
57:08 - However, at this point, the economy sets the stage for a potential turnaround as it moves
57:14 - into the expansion stage.
57:18 - Some of the features of this stage is monetary and fiscal policy employed by the central
57:23 - banks and government, which we'll touch upon later, starting to rise in economic growth,
57:29 - an increase in employment and manufacturing from this trough, and a gradual shift towards
57:36 - increases in profits.
57:38 - Next we have the expansion phase.
57:40 - During this phase, economic activity such as production, employment, and consumer spending
57:45 - is on the rise, as set by the trough.
57:48 - Businesses are expanding and there's a general sense of optimism and an increase in consumer
57:52 - confidence throughout the economy.
57:54 - Growth is driven by an increase in consumer demand, investment, and also by monetary and
57:59 - fiscal policy.
58:01 - As you can see, the effects of fiscal and monetary policy are starting to benefit, however,
58:06 - the governments and central banks are drawing back on their intervention.
58:11 - Economic growth is also still positive, however, it's not as rapid as it was during the trough.
58:17 - At this stage, companies are still hiring and manufacturing activity is ongoing and
58:22 - margins of companies also start to increase.
58:26 - Then we reach the peak.
58:27 - The peak is the highest point of economic activity in the business cycle.
58:31 - At this stage, growth begins to slow and even starts to decrease, and the economy reaches
58:37 - a state of maximum output.
58:39 - However, signs of potential inflationary pressures may begin to emerge.
58:44 - At this point, fiscal and monetary policies employed by central banks and governments
58:48 - may go in the opposite direction to prevent too much growth, which is inflation.
58:52 - Additionally, economic growth stagnates and employers have trouble finding workers and
58:57 - wages increase in value.
58:58 - This is an effect of inflation.
59:00 - Additionally, earnings start to disappoint workers against high expectations due to economic
59:05 - growth.
59:06 - This leads into a recession or a contraction.
59:09 - So following the peak, the economy enters this contractionary phase.
59:15 - Economic indicators like GDP, employment, and consumer spending, which we touched upon
59:19 - earlier, start to decline.
59:21 - Businesses cut down on production, start laying off employees, and this may result in a decrease
59:26 - in consumer confidence.
59:28 - This phase is commonly referred to as a recession, but this term varies depending on the severity
59:35 - and duration of this period.
59:38 - Business cycle is driven by various factors, including shifts in consumer and investor
59:41 - sentiments, increased technology, and changes to monetary and fiscal policies.
59:45 - However, it is continuous and it always happens.
59:50 - However, one thing to note is that in this graph, we see the business cycle as reaching
59:55 - the trough again, right?
59:58 - But one thing to notice is that the economy is constantly growing, so it's on an upward
60:02 - trend.
60:03 - However, these cycles go throughout the upward trend, if that makes sense.
60:08 - If you look closely here, the trough in the original early cycle is a bit lower than the
60:13 - trough after we reached the recession.
60:16 - This shows that the economy is growing, however, while it's growing, it is experiencing cycles.
60:21 - Okay, so the key factors of the macro-economy that we'll be touching upon.
60:25 - GDP, or gross domestic product, unemployment slash unemployment, inflation, and interest
60:31 - rates, which we've already discussed.
60:34 - So first, what is GDP?
60:36 - GDP, or the gross domestic product of a company, represents the total cost of goods being sold
60:41 - in that country or in that nation in a period, typically one year.
60:46 - So GDP is calculated as consumer spending, which is C, investments made, which is I,
60:52 - government spending, which is G, and the difference between exports and imports, which is represented
60:57 - as X minus M.
60:58 - Okay, something to note about industries and the business cycles.
61:06 - Certain industries and companies are divided into categories called cyclical or defensive
61:12 - categories.
61:14 - Cyclical industries are industries which face the repercussions of the business cycle.
61:18 - During certain times, they will be in an upward boom, and during certain times, they may not
61:22 - be able to operate at all.
61:25 - Examples of this include the hotel industry, resorts, dining, and any other excessive industries
61:31 - that are created by consumer wants.
61:35 - Defensive industries, on the other hand, are things that aren't too heavily affected by
61:38 - the business cycle.
61:39 - This is because they're necessary for human operation.
61:43 - Things like this include health services, utilities, health technology, and so on.
61:48 - However, some industries are in between cyclical and defensive.
61:53 - For example, consumer services are somewhat cyclical and somewhat defensive.
61:58 - For example, things like accommodation are cyclical and defensive to some extent.
62:04 - Some houses in certain areas, which may be seen as luxury, may be cyclical when it comes
62:09 - to renting or on Airbnb.
62:11 - However, basic accommodation is defensive since humans need it at all times.
62:18 - So first, unemployment.
62:20 - So unemployment is split into three categories, cyclical, structural, and frictional.
62:26 - So what is cyclical unemployment?
62:29 - Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the overall economy.
62:32 - When the economy enters a recession or a downturn, demand for goods and services decreases, causing
62:37 - businesses to scale back production.
62:40 - As a result, they lay off workers leading to cyclical unemployment.
62:44 - Consider the construction industry.
62:46 - During an economic boom, there's a high demand for new homes and infrastructural projects.
62:51 - Construction companies hire more workers to meet this growing demand.
62:54 - However, when a recession hits, the demand for new projects drops, causing these companies
62:59 - to cut back on their workforce, resulting in cyclical unemployment for construction
63:03 - workers.
63:04 - Similarly, in the tourism sector, when the economy is thriving, people have more disposable
63:09 - income to travel and explore.
63:11 - This leads to increased demand for flights, hotels, entertainment like movies, and so
63:15 - on.
63:16 - Yet, in an economic downturn, people tighten their budgets, leading to reduced travel and
63:21 - low demand for these tourism-related services.
63:24 - And as a result, there are losses in jobs in this industry.
63:28 - In both examples, cyclical unemployment is closely tied to the fluctuations in the business
63:32 - cycle which we saw earlier.
63:34 - As the economy contracts and expands, industries that heavily rely on consumer spending and
63:39 - investments can experience shifts in employment levels due to the changes in demand.
63:46 - Next we have structural unemployment.
63:49 - Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the skills and qualifications of job
63:53 - seekers and the requirements of available jobs.
63:56 - This mismatch is often caused by changes in the economy, such as due to technology or
64:01 - shifts in consumer preferences, making certain skills obsolete or less in demand.
64:06 - For instance, let's consider the decline of the typewriter industry with the advent
64:10 - of computers.
64:12 - Skill typists, who were very proficient at using the typewriter, might have found themselves
64:16 - structurally unemployed as the demand for their specific skillset, efficient use of
64:20 - the typewriter, dwindled due to technological advancements.
64:24 - This is because computers were much more efficient, much more accessible, and people could do
64:28 - the same job that typewriters could do at home by themselves.
64:33 - Another example could be seen in the decline of manufacturing jobs in certain regions.
64:37 - As manufacturing processes became more automated, companies may require fewer workers on the
64:42 - factory floor.
64:44 - This can lead to structural unemployment as individuals with specific skills to manual
64:47 - assembly or machine operations face challenges of finding relevant employment.
64:52 - In the modern context, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and automation
64:57 - could potentially lead to structural employment for certain administrative roles which do
65:01 - work that AI can easily replace.
65:04 - These include tasks like data entry or customer service, which AI, even at its current state,
65:09 - can likely handle, rendering these traditional jobs unnecessary.
65:14 - Structural unemployment underscores the importance of continuous skill development and adaptation
65:18 - to changing job markets.
65:20 - Individuals need to retain and acquire new skills to remain competitive in an evolving
65:24 - landscape and minimize the impact of structural shifts in the economy.
65:29 - Lastly, we have frictional unemployment.
65:32 - Frictional unemployment is likely the type of unemployment that most people will experience.
65:37 - It occurs when individuals are transitioning between jobs or entering the workforce for
65:41 - the first time.
65:42 - It's a natural and unavoidable aspect of a dynamic job market, where people are constantly
65:47 - seeking better, higher-paying jobs with better benefits, while employers are looking for
65:52 - better and better candidates.
65:55 - Imagine a recent college graduate entering the job market.
65:58 - They might experience frictional unemployment as they search for their first full-time position.
66:02 - During this time, they're looking for a job that aligns with their skills, interests,
66:05 - career goals, pay, and maybe it's even close to their house.
66:09 - This process of searching and applying and interviewing and negotiating tasks takes time
66:14 - and can result in temporary unemployment, which we refer to as frictional unemployment.
66:19 - Another example is when someone voluntarily leaves a job to pursue a new opportunity.
66:23 - They may experience frictional unemployment during the gap between leaving one job and
66:27 - starting their next job.
66:28 - This gap is often necessary to handle the logistics of transitioning, such as relocating
66:32 - or completing necessary paperwork.
66:35 - Frictional unemployment, while inevitable, can be reduced through effective job search
66:39 - strategies, networking, and the use of online job platforms.
66:44 - It's important to note that frictional unemployment is generally considered to be a healthy aspect
66:48 - of a dynamic job market, as it reflects the individual's ability to move and their flexibility
66:54 - in pursuing opportunities that best fit their skill sets and aspirations.
66:59 - So, inflation.
67:02 - When we're calculating GDP, as we learned earlier, the value of money changes over time.
67:07 - Money in the future is not worth the same as it is right now.
67:11 - As a result, GDP numbers without being deflated could show consistent growth, whereas in reality,
67:17 - the real GDP, which is what we refer to GDP with the time value of money taken into account,
67:22 - could be decreasing.
67:23 - As a result, to calculate the real GDP of a country, we take the nominal GDP, which
67:28 - is what would be reported, and we take away the impact of inflation.
67:33 - Okay, so who is really playing a role in the macroeconomy?
67:40 - So, the two main players that control it are the governments and central banks, which implement
67:46 - and develop policies.
67:48 - And as a result, companies and consumers are impacted by these changes and need to react.
67:53 - So, governments implement fiscal policy, whereas banks implement monetary policy.
68:01 - So, first, what is monetary policy?
68:05 - Monetary policy involves a bank's management of a country's money supply and interest
68:09 - rates to influence economic activity.
68:12 - By adjusting interest rates and employing tools like open market operations, central
68:16 - banks can control inflation, encourage borrowing, and spending during slow economic periods
68:22 - using expansionary monetary policy, or cool down an overheating economy using a contractionary
68:27 - monetary policy.
68:30 - Expansionary monetary policy is when central banks reduce interest rates to make borrowing
68:34 - money easier for consumers.
68:36 - This is because the interest they would have to pay on a loan reduces, taking the loan
68:40 - much more appealing.
68:42 - Contractionary monetary policy, on the other hand, is when central banks increase interest
68:46 - rates to make borrowing more expensive, causing borrowers to pay more interest on their loans,
68:52 - decreasing the appeal of these loans.
68:57 - An interesting example of monetary policy in action is Japan's use of interest rates
69:01 - to stimulate the economy.
69:03 - Typically, in a country that is using expansionary monetary policy, interest rates could be lowered
69:09 - from 3% to 2%, for example, to encourage borrowing.
69:14 - Japan, however, decided to take an unconventional approach.
69:17 - The Bank of Japan set an interest rate of negative 0.1.
69:22 - This is extremely unique and a choice made by Japan's government to meet their specific
69:26 - needs.
69:27 - This was their attempt to overcome deflation, which was a big issue in Japan.
69:31 - By making interest rates negative, it makes it more economical to borrow and spend money
69:36 - than just holding on to it.
69:38 - As a result, people kept taking on loans because it was generating that money, and as a result,
69:43 - they started spending more, which stimulated Japan's economy.
69:51 - Now fiscal policy.
69:52 - Fiscal policy involves how governments use taxes and spending to influence the country's
69:58 - economy.
69:59 - By adjusting tax rates and government spending levels, governments aim to stimulate the economic
70:03 - growth during downturns, using expansionary fiscal policy, or control inflation during
70:08 - periods of high growth, using contractionary fiscal policy.
70:12 - So expansionary fiscal policy, similar to expansionary monetary policy, is when governments
70:16 - spend more money to increase the circulation of money within the circular flow of income,
70:21 - which creates jobs and more.
70:23 - Contractory fiscal policy is when governments increase interest rates to decrease the disposable
70:27 - income of people to reduce their spendings.
70:30 - An example of how governments can spend their money is through investments in military,
70:35 - investments in infrastructure, or investments in social programs, which stimulate the economy,
70:40 - and can be called injections.
70:42 - The ways they can influence tax rates are through increases or decreases in corporate
70:46 - tax, and increases or decreases in individual tax, like income rates.
70:51 - Fiscal policy, as we mentioned earlier, can be expansionary to promote spending, or contractionary
70:56 - to reduce spending.
70:58 - As you can assume, monetary policy, which is influenced by the central bank, is much
71:02 - more fast-acting than fiscal policy.
71:05 - Controlling interest rates is much faster than starting infrastructural projects, which can
71:09 - take years to see the effects of.
71:12 - Because interest rates can directly affect money circulation, they affect much faster.
71:16 - Whereas things like infrastructural projects, their benefits come from increased employment
71:21 - and injections into the economy in the form of available buildings where companies can
71:26 - relocate.
71:27 - This often takes time for companies to find these locations to relocate, and additionally,
71:32 - employment doesn't immediately increase the economy.
71:39 - In this section, we'll be going over ESG, or environment, social, and governance for
71:44 - short.
71:45 - ESG has become a topic of much concern in recent years especially, but has existed for
71:50 - hundreds of years and even beyond that.
71:52 - ESG is the social mission of a company, and integrating social aspects and objectives
71:58 - within a company's goals.
72:00 - However, there is an increasing demand for ESG in the investing process from investors
72:05 - and stakeholders alike.
72:06 - However, there is so much skepticism regarding the role of ESG and responsible investing.
72:13 - And the idea that focusing on ESG means compromising returns.
72:17 - However, this isn't the case.
72:19 - In this section, we'll be going over what ESG is, why it's so important, and how investors
72:24 - should take into consideration ESG not only advance social goals, but to ensure that their
72:30 - portfolios are profitable.
72:32 - Alright, so first, what is ESG?
72:35 - ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governments, is a comprehensive framework
72:40 - that evaluates a company's performance and practices in three key areas.
72:45 - The environmental aspect focuses on how a company interacts with the planet, from how
72:48 - it goes about carbon emissions, to managing resources, to addressing waste and pollution.
72:54 - The social aspect revolves around relationships, including how a company treats its employees,
72:59 - fosters diversity and inclusion, and engages with local communities through initiatives
73:04 - and philanthropy, and CSR.
73:07 - Finally, the governance aspect examines a company's internal structure, ethics, and
73:11 - accountability.
73:12 - This encompasses everything, from the composition of the board of directors, to ensuring transparency,
73:18 - integrity, and adherence to regulations.
73:20 - ESG is more than just a trend.
73:23 - It's a strategic approach that considers the broader impact of business activities
73:26 - on the environment, society, and ethical practices.
73:31 - So the origin of ESG.
73:32 - Although ESG has become much more well-known with people outside the investing landscape
73:38 - in recent years, it's existed for so long.
73:41 - The origins of ESG can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when discussions about corporate
73:46 - social responsibility started to take shape.
73:48 - However, it wasn't until the 1960s and 70s, fueled by social movements advocating for
73:53 - civil rights, that awareness of corporate impacts began to grow.
73:57 - This era saw the emergence of ethical investing, where investors excluded industries that conflicted
74:02 - with their own moral values.
74:04 - Global crises, including environmental disasters and financial meltdowns, further highlighted
74:09 - the urgent need for responsible business practices.
74:12 - In 2006, the United Nations took a significant step by launching the Principles for Responsible
74:17 - Investment, or PRI for short, signaling a formal commitment to integrating ESG considerations
74:22 - into investment decisions today.
74:24 - These historical milestones collectively paved the way for development and widespread adoption
74:28 - of ESG framework that we recognize today.
74:33 - Okay, so the importance of ESG.
74:36 - The significance of ESG lies in its ability to guide businesses towards long-term sustainability
74:41 - and success.
74:43 - By integrating environmental, social, and governance factors, companies not only reduce
74:47 - their environmental footprint, companies not only reduce their environmental footprint,
74:54 - but also foster innovation and adapt to changing landscapes.
74:57 - ESG practices aren't just about doing good, they're about managing risks effectively.
75:03 - Identifying potential environmental and social vulnerabilities can shield a company from
75:06 - future disruptions.
75:07 - Moreover, a robust ESG strategy enhances a company's reputation, building credibility
75:12 - and trust with stakeholders.
75:14 - This is especially crucial in an era where consumers and investors expect more than just
75:18 - financial returns.
75:20 - Beyond reputation, ESG practices ensure regulatory compliance as standards evolve, demonstrating
75:26 - a commitment to ethical conduct and transparency.
75:29 - In essence, ESG is more than just a buzzword.
75:32 - It's a strategic imperative that not only ensures businesses thrive, but also contribute
75:37 - positively to the world around them.
75:40 - So let's look at it in the modern investing lens.
75:43 - ESG has transformed the investment landscape by introducing a responsible approach to decision
75:48 - making.
75:49 - Investors now factor ESG considerations when crafting their portfolios and align their
75:53 - investments with ethical and sustainable values.
75:56 - It's not just about these values though, it's about potential financial benefits.
76:01 - ESG integration offers the promise of improved risk-adjusted returns, as companies with strong
76:06 - ESG practices often demonstrate resilience when faced with uncertainty.
76:10 - ESG-aligned companies also appeal to investors with a long-term outlook, as they prioritize
76:15 - sustainability in both environmental and self-sustainability and are better equipped to weather market
76:21 - fluctuations.
76:22 - Notably, research indicates that companies excelling in ESG can even outperform their
76:30 - peers financially.
76:31 - Beyond profit, ESG opens doors to impact investing, where investors actively contribute to positive
76:38 - societal and environmental changes through their investment choices.
76:41 - The integration of ESG factors signal a fundamental shift in how investors perceive value, emphasizing
76:47 - both financial returns and contributions to a more sustainable world.
76:53 - This is especially important in a modern world.
76:56 - With factors like social media, ESG has become even more important, and companies that fail
77:00 - to adopt ESG are placed under much more scrutiny as we'll see in future examples, compared
77:05 - to companies who do adopt ESG.
77:09 - The impact on stakeholders ESG doesn't just affect a company's internal
77:12 - practices, it extends to its relationship with stakeholders.
77:16 - Employees, for instance, are more engaged and satisfied when they work for a company
77:19 - that prioritizes their well-being and supports a positive workplace culture through ESG practices.
77:25 - Customers too are drawn to brands that align with their own values, and ESG provides that
77:31 - connection.
77:32 - Companies with strong ESG values tend to attract and retain socially conscious customers, thus
77:36 - strengthening brand loyalty.
77:39 - Beyond employees and customers, ESG initiatives have a positive ripple effect on their local
77:44 - communities, contributing to societal well-being and forging deeper community connections.
77:49 - Investors and other stakeholders also expect transparency and ethical conduct, making ESG
77:53 - an essential aspect of building trust.
77:56 - Ultimately, effective ESG practices manage not only a company's reputation, but also
78:01 - its relationship with the broader ecosystem that it operates within.
78:07 - The global impact of ESG
78:09 - As we said before, ESG is not limited to companies and not just communities either, and it has
78:14 - a significant effect on global outreach.
78:16 - By prioritizing environmental sustainability, ESG practices align with global objectives,
78:21 - such as mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity.
78:25 - On the social front, ESG initiatives address pressing challenges like poverty and inequality,
78:30 - contributing to a broader global development.
78:33 - The collaborative nature of ESG becomes evident through partnerships between companies, governments,
78:38 - and organizations across borders, all working together to address shared challenges.
78:42 - ESG encourages companies to innovate sustainably, develop solutions that can drive positive
78:48 - impacts on a global scale, and innovate more.
78:52 - So, as a financial investor, how do you assess a business's ESG?
78:58 - Now that we've established that ESG is important, how do we go about measuring it?
79:02 - Assessing a company's ESG performance involves evaluating its practices across environmental,
79:07 - social, and governance dimensions.
79:09 - ESG rating agencies play a pivotal role, providing scores based on established criteria that
79:15 - measure companies' alignment with ESG practices.
79:19 - In some sectors, specific ESG standards are in place, setting expectations for how companies
79:24 - should operate sustainably.
79:27 - As you can see on screen, there is something called the MSCI ESG rating, which is one of
79:31 - the ESG rating agencies.
79:33 - Additionally, transparency is key, as companies share their ESG data through reports disclosing
79:39 - their efforts and impacts.
79:41 - A critical aspect is materiality, which means focusing on the ESG factors most relevant
79:46 - to a company and its industry.
79:48 - This ensures that efforts are targeted where they matter most.
79:51 - ESG assessments serve as a dynamic tool for companies not just to measure their current
79:55 - performance, but to identify areas for growth and enhancement.
80:00 - So, how can businesses incorporate ESG?
80:05 - Incorporating ESG into business operations requires a nuanced and comprehensive approach.
80:10 - It starts with strong leadership commitment, with top management actively championing ESG
80:15 - principles.
80:16 - It can't just be an afterthought, it needs to be integrated into the core business strategy,
80:20 - along with the business principles and the business plan, which we discussed earlier.
80:26 - Stakeholder engagement is critical.
80:27 - Making employees, customers, and partners ensure that ESG initiatives align with their
80:31 - needs and concerns.
80:33 - To measure progress, establish clear ESG metrics and targets, or maybe consult ESG agencies.
80:39 - This helps hold companies accountable for their efforts.
80:42 - Additionally, awareness is key, so employees understand the significance of ESG and their
80:46 - role and its implementation.
80:49 - Innovation thrives when ESG goals are aligned, so companies should encourage research and
80:53 - development that supports sustainability.
80:57 - So ESG vs non-ESG stocks.
81:00 - Although we've clearly established that ESG does have benefits, how does it really help
81:04 - in reality?
81:05 - Theory isn't always right.
81:07 - So let's look at in reality.
81:09 - The choice between ESG and non-ESG stocks has had significant implications for investors.
81:13 - ESG-aligned companies tend to demonstrate better risk management and resilience against
81:18 - market turbulence, as we mentioned earlier.
81:21 - Research indicates that over the long term, ESG stocks can potentially outperform their
81:25 - non-ESG counterparts, driven by sustainable practices and responsible strategies.
81:30 - Moreover, as the demand for ethical and sustainable investments grow, especially in the modern
81:35 - world, ESG stocks could experience increased investor interest.
81:39 - ESG-aligned companies may also face fewer regulatory hurdles and reputational risks,
81:45 - making them more potentially stable choices.
81:47 - For example, they may not be affected by laws governing carbon taxes, and they may not have
81:52 - fit quotas which most companies that are non-ESG focused may fail to meet.
81:57 - Beyond just financial gains, investing in ESG stocks also aligns with broader trends
82:01 - in responsible investing and sustainable consumer behavior.
82:06 - So let's look at a mock situation and compare two companies, one which follows ESG practices
82:11 - and one that doesn't.
82:13 - The company that produces renewable energy has a strong track record of reducing carbon
82:19 - emissions and promoting clear energy.
82:21 - As a result, they have experienced steady growth driven by an increased demand for renewable
82:25 - energy sources and favorable regulatory policies which may reduce tax or provide subsidies.
82:32 - Additionally, they'll experience positive media, which can also help boost the company.
82:37 - On the other hand, a company which relies on fossil fuels will experience criticism
82:41 - for their environmental impact and negative media due to their contributions to climate
82:44 - change.
82:45 - As a result, their stock is likely to be volatile due to fluctuating oil prices in a dynamic
82:50 - market, changing that market dynamics, and growing concerns about environmental sustainability.
82:56 - As a result, in this situation, it's clear that the prior case is better when they use
82:59 - renewable energy.
83:00 - Additionally, let's look at a second example, but this time focusing on the social and governance
83:05 - aspects.
83:07 - In a diverse workplace, a company that promotes a gender and ethnic diversity and a workforce
83:12 - that represents a wide range of backgrounds is more likely to succeed than one that doesn't
83:17 - have these same practices.
83:19 - This is because employees are likely to be more motivated in the workplace and media
83:23 - is likely to show companies that focus on diversity in a positive light, whereas companies
83:27 - that don't focus are likely to face criticism.
83:31 - However, this is a nuanced approach.
83:34 - We need to look at reality, and in some cases, companies that don't have ESG principles
83:39 - in the moment may outperform those which do.
83:41 - However, in the long run, it's important to note that as the world becomes increasingly
83:46 - focused on social objectives, ESG will grow in importance, and as a result, non-ESG companies
83:52 - that may be in a better position now may not be in that same position in the future.
83:59 - So in this section, we'll just go over how to construct a portfolio and diversification,
84:04 - and the types of management, and the basics of how you construct a portfolio.
84:08 - So first of all, what is diversification?
84:12 - Diversification is essentially the process of purchasing assets from different asset
84:18 - classes to expand the number and type of securities in your portfolio.
84:23 - So if we look at this diagram, we can see here that on the x-axis, there's a number
84:28 - of securities, and on the y-axis, there's a standard deviation of your portfolio's
84:33 - return.
84:35 - The height represents the total risk, and as you can see, as the number of securities
84:39 - in your portfolio increases, the amount of unsystematic risk decreases, where a systematic
84:44 - risk persists, and we'll get to that in a bit.
84:48 - Essentially by purchasing more securities, you're going with the concept of not putting
84:54 - all your eggs in one basket.
84:56 - And since you're spreading your risk over the portfolio by choosing companies in different
84:59 - sectors and industries, you're able to avoid your portfolio crashing if one of these things
85:05 - fails.
85:08 - Empirical evidence suggests that all it takes is about 30 to 40 different securities to
85:12 - achieve a fully diversified portfolio.
85:16 - Okay, so what are the types of risk?
85:20 - Well, there's systematic and unsystematic risk.
85:23 - Systematic risk is a market risk, which is non-diversable, which means you can get rid
85:28 - of it if you diversify, and it stems from market-wide risks.
85:33 - Unsystematic risks, on the other hand, are company or industry-specific risks that are
85:37 - inherent to a specific investment.
85:40 - Systematic risks are non-diversifiable, which means that they cannot get rid of.
85:46 - This is a risk that remains after efforts have been taken to diversify a portfolio.
85:51 - Systematic risk incorporates things like interest rate changes, inflation, recessions, and wars,
85:56 - among other major changes.
85:58 - Shifts in these things can affect the entire market and cannot be mitigated by changing
86:02 - positions within a portfolio of equities, because it affects every single equity.
86:07 - For example, the global financial crisis is a great example of systematic risk.
86:12 - Anyone who invested in the market in 2008 saw the values of their investment change
86:16 - drastically from this economic event.
86:18 - The Great Recession affected asset classes in different ways, as riskier securities,
86:23 - typically those that were leveraged more, were sold off in large quantities, whereas
86:27 - simpler assets like treasury bonds became more valuable.
86:31 - Unsystematic risk is a company or industry-specific risk that is inherent with each investment,
86:37 - and other systematic risks can be reduced by diversifying, as we've seen in this diagram.
86:44 - Systematic risks include things like inflation risk, interest rate risk, exchange rate risk,
86:48 - and things like pandemics and war.
86:51 - Net risks are things like business risk, financial risk, default risk, and liquidity risk, which
86:55 - are specific to certain companies.
86:59 - So how do you measure your portfolio's performance?
87:02 - Well, the best way to do so is using benchmarks.
87:07 - A benchmark is a standard tool or measure that you can use to analyze the risk of a
87:13 - gear and portfolio.
87:15 - Individual funds and investment portfolios will typically have an established benchmark
87:20 - that you can already use for standard analysis to check your level of risk.
87:27 - Time-weighted vs. dollar-weighted returns
87:30 - Time-weighted returns are determined without regard to any subsequent cash flows from the
87:34 - investor.
87:35 - It measures the performance of the investment over a certain period of time, not the returns
87:39 - of the investor.
87:41 - Returns quoted by mutual funds and other investment managers are time-weighted because the portfolio
87:45 - manager doesn't have any control over future cash flows of investor dollars.
87:50 - In contrast, a dollar-weighted return considers subsequent contributions to and withdraws
87:55 - from an investment.
87:56 - For example, it considers timings and sales of purchases.
88:00 - A dollar-weighted approach focuses on the returns of the investor over a period of time,
88:05 - and this will usually differ from the time-weighted return.
88:10 - So how do you measure portfolio risk?
88:13 - Well, to measure risk, we need to identify what risk is.
88:17 - As we mentioned earlier, risk is the chance that a stock might fail, or the risk of volatility.
88:24 - So to measure risk, we would measure the chance that the performance of your portfolio as
88:28 - a whole would differ from the returns of the market or the benchmark portfolio.
88:33 - And the best way to calculate risk is using a standard deviation, which gives you returns
88:38 - over a given period.
88:40 - Standard deviation is the measure of dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
88:45 - It measures the absolute variability of a distribution.
88:49 - In essence, the greater the standard deviation, the greater the deviation from the mean.
88:57 - And this is the formula to calculate standard deviation.
88:59 - If any of you have taken statistics before, you'd be able to understand it.
89:03 - But if not, it's not necessary that you understand how to calculate standard deviation to actually
89:07 - employ it.
89:08 - You can use any online calculator to actually figure it out.
89:15 - So here is a standard deviation belt curve.
89:17 - Essentially the areas within the curve are more or the higher likely opportunities.
89:22 - So in this general area, 68.27% of opportunities will follow this.
89:29 - But as we go to the extremes, more and more situations will fall under the blanket.
89:35 - However, the rate at which it does so is diminishing.
89:40 - So active versus passive management.
89:43 - Passive investment strategies seek to replicate the constituents, weights, and therefore the
89:48 - risk and returns of a specific benchmark of index securities.
89:51 - It's a by-and-hold strategy that does not seek to pick winners and losers among the
89:56 - securities, but rather just hold them and see how things play out.
89:59 - The benefits of passive management include low fees, enhanced tax efficiency that stems
90:04 - from low portfolio turnover, and a limited portfolio management infrastructure, essentially
90:09 - meaning it's easier to manage yourself.
90:11 - The most popular use of vehicles for passive investment include index mutual funds and
90:17 - ETFs, or exchange traded funds.
90:20 - Active management, on the other hand, is based on the belief that risk-adjusted returns above
90:24 - the benchmark can be achieved through security selection, market timing, and sector rotations
90:29 - by highly skilled professional portfolio managers.
90:33 - Actually meaning you pick and choose stocks based on how you think they're going to do.
90:37 - Actively managed portfolios generally result in significant portfolio turnover as the manager
90:42 - reacts to market and temporary trends, either observed or forecasted.
90:47 - This high turnover combined with the costs to staff our portfolio and management team
90:52 - requires the manager to charge significantly higher fees than they would charge for a passively
90:56 - managed portfolio, and generally results in poor tax efficiency as frequent buying and
91:01 - selling of securities may result in something called a capital gains tax, which is essentially
91:07 - the tax you pay when you sell stocks.
91:10 - This capital gains tax is greater when you sell a stock within a period of less than
91:14 - a year, and it's less when you sell a stock that you've held for greater than a year.
91:19 - In the past, the S&P 500 has had significantly more success than actively traded portfolios.
91:26 - This has been occurring for the past 20 years, and you could replicate the index yourself.
91:30 - For example, you could buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 in the same proportion that
91:35 - they are in the S&P 500 index.
91:38 - But the issue with that is that you would have to constantly monitor the investments
91:41 - and buy and sell at the weights of these companies on the index.
91:46 - Some large institutional investors like pension funds do this, but it's more impractical for
91:51 - day to day investors like you and me.
91:54 - Especially when you look at just the S&P 500, when you look at things like the Russell 2000,
91:58 - it becomes even more impractical.
92:00 - For us, there are two options, index mutual funds and index ETFs, which are similar to
92:05 - mutual funds but trade continuously over the course of a day, like a stock.
92:10 - But in reality, it's not best to stick to either passive or active investment, or rather
92:15 - to do a hybrid form of management where you incorporate both aspects, some index and some
92:20 - active stocks.
92:22 - Let's look at Yale.
92:24 - Yale with their fixed income had an internal team to buy securities and bought a number
92:29 - of fixed assets and active assets to generate revenues.
92:34 - If you've looked at the news recently or in the past, you may have seen how active managers
92:38 - are outpacing things like the S&P 500.
92:41 - For example, Peter Lynch racked up a 29% return at Maglum fund from 1977 to 1990, including
92:48 - dividends, and he outpaced the S&P 500 by more than 13% a year during that time.
92:54 - However, his investing style was very lucrative during that period.
92:58 - And although some people may have praised him, we can introduce that to some extent
93:03 - luck was an important factor in his success.
93:06 - Although he did buy high quality companies that traded at a reasonable price, he wasn't
93:10 - able to do this for a consistent period of time, unlike what you would be able to do
93:14 - with investing in the S&P 500 for a longer period of time.
93:19 - So although certain stock pickers are able to beat funds like the S&P 500, it's a mistake
93:23 - to assume that this success will persist into the future.
93:27 - As a result, it's important to diversify your portfolio by also including stocks that
93:31 - are passive that you don't need to manage as much, and active funds as well.
93:38 - Now in this short section, after we've discussed all these financial investments, I want to
93:43 - talk to you about alternative investments.
93:46 - Throughout this course, we've talked about stocks, bonds, business strategy, the economy,
93:52 - financial documents, and so on.
93:54 - But there's so many different ways of investing beyond the traditional stocks and bonds that
93:59 - many people are limited to think are the only viable investment opportunities.
94:04 - As you will go about investing as a businessperson and as an individual, you'll come by opportunities
94:09 - to invest in non-conventional investments.
94:13 - Examples of these include real estate, equipment leasing, hedge funds, and in recent years
94:18 - things like cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
94:21 - It's important to realize these are viable investment opportunities, although they aren't
94:26 - as commonly used as stocks and bonds, although some can argue they are, they are alternative
94:32 - investments that can generate yields and profits if invested in appropriately.
94:38 - So this section is just to talk to you a little bit about what are these alternative investments
94:43 - and some of the characteristics of these alternative investments.
94:47 - So we've had the general investments like equity, private equity, and things like venture
94:51 - capital.
94:52 - Private equity being shares you've bought in a company, and venture capital being capital
94:57 - raised from venture capitalists who are people who are wealthy enough to invest in companies.
95:02 - But alternative investments like real estate include purchasing land or purchasing property.
95:08 - Equipment leasing can be when you lease equipment as a business, which can help you generate
95:13 - revenue when you aren't using equipment, hedge funds, which are a little bit more complicated,
95:19 - but they're similar to investing in a group of stocks, commodities or precious metals.
95:23 - Yes, you can invest in things like lithium or aluminum, cryptocurrencies and collectibles.
95:30 - So things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on, and NFTs.
95:37 - So what are some of the characteristics of these alternative investments?
95:41 - Well, if you look at real estate, for example, they're not very liquid.
95:45 - So illiquidity, which does increase risk.
95:48 - However, this varies from investment to investment.
95:51 - Additionally, they are sold by financial advisors or broker dealers, mostly to accredited investors.
95:58 - As a result, they aren't as easy to come by or as easy to invest in like stocks and
96:02 - bonds are.
96:03 - Additionally, they're to either public or private assets, but they're rarely publicly
96:08 - traded like stocks are on the stock market.
96:12 - Yeah, something to note is that these investments are high risk, high reward.
96:19 - So they are likely to skyrocket in price like we've seen with the cryptocurrency rises,
96:25 - but they're also likely to fall and cause you to lose a lot of money.
96:30 - So when you're investing in alternative investments, especially those with which you're not very
96:34 - well versed, make sure you make an informed decision and go about investing in a safe
96:40 - and ethical way so you don't miss out.
96:46 - All right, everyone, that's a wrap on this course.
96:49 - And just to summarize, we'll go through everything that we've learned.
96:52 - So we've learned about the time value of money, how a mortgage can rack up compound interest,
96:57 - things like how to identify if an investment is a good investment, the importance of capital
97:02 - markets at ESG, all relevant in business.
97:05 - We've also learned things like the business cycle, fiscal and monetary policy, and looked
97:10 - at case studies like Japan to understand the basics of economics.
97:14 - For finance, we've looked at the various financial documents, how to diversify your
97:19 - portfolio, how to mitigate risk and things, and the basics of statistics.
97:24 - Throughout this course, you realize that all of these three disciplines are highly interconnected,
97:28 - and you can study one without understanding the basics of some of the others.
97:33 - I'd like to say congratulations to all of you who have made it this far, and this knowledge
97:37 - will serve you well as you go into the future and explore these concepts in further depth.
97:42 - I'd like to remind you one more time that I do have a YouTube channel called changemakers
97:45 - media, which you'll see in the comment section.
97:48 - I post videos on teenagers who are making an impact in their local and international
97:52 - communities.
97:53 - I would greatly appreciate it if you guys could go down there and subscribe to show
97:56 - your support for these teenagers, and encourage these changemakers to continue impacting the
98:01 - world.
98:02 - That's it for me, everybody, thank you so much, I'll see you in the future, bye bye.
