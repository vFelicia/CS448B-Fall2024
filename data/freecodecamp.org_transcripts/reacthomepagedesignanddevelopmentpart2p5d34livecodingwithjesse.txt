00:02 - hey everybody welcome to live covering
00:06 - with Jesse and today we're gonna keep
00:10 - working on our homepage so I just
00:13 - finished turning that card that we had
00:16 - made on Friday was it Friday yeah anyway
00:23 - so I just finished turning that card
00:25 - into a component so that's what you can
00:27 - see on the screen here probably can't
00:30 - see it right now it's fonts not big
00:32 - enough but make the font a bit bigger we
00:35 - could see that we have this profile card
00:38 - now and so we've replaced a lot of the
00:44 - code with this profile card now this
00:46 - still is a lot but once we put this data
00:50 - into a different format may be imported
00:53 - and you know then it wouldn't really be
00:55 - that much and at some point I would
00:57 - imagine this data would be populated
01:01 - from
01:01 - graph QL but for right now we're gonna
01:03 - hard code this and
01:06 - just so we can get things ready for my
01:08 - presentation first presentation is
01:11 - Thursday yeah Thursday so over the next
01:17 - two weeks I'm going to be presenting
01:19 - this website to a lot of different
01:22 - people here at the university that I
01:23 - work for so I need to get that ready and
01:27 - the launch date potentially is now
01:32 - pushed back a little bit I still would
01:34 - like to launch it on time which would be
01:37 - by the end of the month
01:38 - but having to present to all these
01:41 - people is really gonna slow that down so
01:47 - I'm still shooting for them but
01:50 - realistically it may be later we'll see
01:55 - I did have a question here Michael said
01:58 - I thought Jesse tweeted he was sick and
02:00 - wasn't going today I tweeted that
02:02 - yesterday so I was sick over the weekend
02:07 - but I'm feeling feel better today
02:11 - and let's see hey Anna how's it going
02:16 - and hey everybody in the in the live
02:18 - chat so I'm gonna start out let me give
02:23 - you the link to start with so you all
02:26 - can see this the link to the repository
02:30 - with the code is in the description to
02:32 - this video and now you can actually see
02:39 - the site as we're working at on it with
02:42 - that end Rock link so end Rock if you
02:45 - haven't used it before heard about it
02:47 - and Rock is an awesome little tool and
02:49 - it lets it lets you share a site that
02:55 - you're working on locally with anybody
02:58 - online who you give the link to so it
03:02 - really helps us here on the stream and
03:03 - we were given full access to an
03:09 - unlimited amount of users using the link
03:14 - at one time which is really awesome so
03:18 - check out and Rock if you get a chance
03:20 - I've found it to be very useful and I'm
03:23 - probably gonna use it for maybe one of
03:28 - these meetings okay alright so first
03:37 - thing we need to do then is let's commit
03:42 - what I've done and push that to the repo
03:46 - so you all can see that and then we can
03:47 - move on so let me commit that first and
03:55 - then I see a few more questions in the
03:58 - live chat that would be good to address
03:59 - first before we start any coding so let
04:03 - me commit and then all I'll answer the
04:05 - questions all rights to get status oops
04:11 - can't spell there we are
04:14 - yes can I steal my spell oh no that one
04:17 - worked let me know if the fonts too
04:19 - small as well I can never tell from my
04:23 - screen if it's too small
04:25 - not okay so pages and profile
04:30 - yep that's exactly what what I expected
04:33 - to change which is good so let's do get
04:35 - add and we're gonna add that little dot
04:38 - afterwards just means we're gonna add
04:39 - everything and then go do yarn cm this
04:44 - is something we have set up for our
04:46 - project in particular you wouldn't
04:48 - normally do this unless you you've set
04:50 - up your project this way but if you do
04:51 - want to contribute to this project when
04:54 - you go to commit type yarn cm instead of
04:57 - a normal git commit and then you'll
04:59 - you'll have these options to be able to
05:01 - more properly format your commit so
05:05 - let's add victim
05:11 - I guess web teacher can phone no
05:29 - breaking changes I so this needs to whoa
05:39 - oops I guess I forgot to remove some of
05:43 - this which is a common mistake at least
05:52 - for me so let's try this what's the
05:56 - command it sneaky watching right now
06:02 - Nikki told me about a command I could
06:05 - use to not have to type this all in
06:08 - again and now I can't remember what it
06:09 - was what was it
06:17 - let's just try
06:21 - see and can I get no retry that's it the
06:33 - retry flag thank you our shed said two
06:39 - dashes yeah
06:50 - and thank sneaky that's so much nicer
06:56 - than having to type it all again all
06:58 - right awesome
06:59 - so we'll get push and now that's
07:05 - available on github so y'all can check
07:08 - out how we pulled out what we had done
07:12 - last week and now it's its own component
07:14 - and all the styles of course are in this
07:19 - component as well so we were able to
07:20 - remove some styles from this main index
07:22 - file let's see oh there was an error it
07:34 - didn't catch that let's see
07:44 - oh okay to reoffer the link profile link
08:04 - that's fun
08:10 - Oh 58
08:31 - that's odd that the committe went
08:34 - through even though we had an error I
08:35 - thought it wouldn't get through so why a
08:47 - nun props file a same and lank at
08:52 - profile card 58 we should not have a
08:55 - class name unless somehow this is being
09:00 - passed down because it's in card actions
09:06 - ok harsh it said it's not air just a
09:08 - warning
09:19 - okay if I have to guess with that error
09:22 - or warning is about I'm gonna say
09:26 - potentially since we have this link
09:28 - inside the card actions something's
09:31 - going on with this yeah that's that's
09:36 - what I'm guessing that material UI is
09:40 - attaching something in here in
09:43 - particular class name because we're not
09:46 - obviously we're not trying to put class
09:48 - name on the link component so with
09:55 - scarred actions okay yeah so for now I
10:04 - guess I can live with that warning let
10:09 - me double check yeah everything's
10:12 - displaying properly so I'm gonna live
10:16 - with that warning for now I would like
10:19 - to sort that out at some point before we
10:21 - launch but I need to get this looking
10:26 - good so I can't really get sidetracked
10:29 - by that right now because running out of
10:32 - time to update the look here and
10:37 - speaking of the look let me pull this
10:39 - over for those of you who for whatever
10:42 - reason can't get on and rock you know
10:44 - this is how we're looking now let me
10:45 - make it smaller since we're primarily
10:47 - looking at the the mobile view this is
10:51 - that component that we had made I asked
10:54 - my boss about the italic which is what
10:56 - we had gone over last week and he said
10:59 - he preferred this instead of the italic
11:02 - but he would like some type of like icon
11:07 - that's quotation mark or potentially
11:10 - even like a watermark thing behind this
11:14 - you know that's a quotation mark so
11:20 - probably put that in that's not really a
11:22 - priority right now if anyone wants to
11:25 - you know try to see how that would look
11:29 - you know feel free to open a pull
11:31 - request we'll check it out
11:33 - but I'm not going to spend any more time
11:35 - on this component right now what I can
11:38 - do and I probably won't do this on the
11:39 - stream when we wanted a different
11:41 - component but now that we have this
11:42 - component we can put in what we want I'm
11:45 - going to add you know a faculty profile
11:47 - and alumni profile and throw in some
11:52 - different content and I'll be able to
11:56 - use that to display the homepage at my
11:58 - meetings all right so now let's work on
12:09 - let's work on this events I know this is
12:12 - an important section to my boss the
12:15 - events and then the news which did we
12:18 - even make that you know we didn't so
12:20 - let's start out with this events one and
12:24 - work on it in particular we're
12:27 - definitely going to want I think the
12:30 - images need to be a bit bigger that's at
12:33 - least for me this is really hard to see
12:35 - something that small it would work maybe
12:37 - if our events were just maybe somebody's
12:40 - face and it took up most of their you
12:43 - know the area but that's not how the
12:44 - events are going to be and also needs
12:50 - some sort of description I would think
12:55 - since we're talking about events here it
12:57 - might not be a bad idea to put a date
13:01 - now eventually we're probably going to
13:04 - want to connect this with some type of I
13:07 - don't know event service so maybe
13:11 - Eventbrite maybe just a Google Calendar
13:14 - I don't know so the data for these
13:17 - events is not going to come from our
13:19 - WordPress CMS it's probably gonna come
13:24 - from somewhere else we don't need to
13:26 - worry about that right now for the
13:27 - presentation we'll just hard code some
13:29 - stuff
13:34 - all right I did say I wanted to address
13:37 - one of these questions in here before we
13:40 - coated
13:52 - why was it
14:01 - okay Alexander asked do you have any
14:03 - projects that we can work on with you
14:07 - yep pretty much any of the projects that
14:11 - are in the fu s Markham github
14:14 - organization which you can get the link
14:16 - to this project here and then from there
14:19 - you can easily get to the organization
14:20 - and see our other projects but pretty
14:22 - much any of those projects you can work
14:25 - on check out the issues for each project
14:27 - and that'll give you some ideas on what
14:29 - still needs done or if you notice
14:31 - something that really looks broken you
14:33 - could bring up an issue or open a pull
14:36 - request and you know potentially you
14:39 - know that could get merged then pretty
14:40 - much every pull requests for the most
14:43 - part does get merged in occasionally it
14:45 - will need some work before it it's ready
14:50 - to be merged in but I try to work with
14:52 - everybody so if you're nervous about you
14:55 - know submitting pull requests to
14:57 - projects these projects that we work on
14:59 - for the stream are a great place to
15:01 - start because I'll help you out as much
15:04 - as I can to work on your pool request
15:11 - alright so let me get started we're
15:19 - gonna use this Pomodoro timer you go for
15:22 - 25 minutes I do need to make sure the
15:25 - stream we can go maybe like an hour 15
15:29 - minutes
15:29 - total with this stream so I have some
15:32 - other stuff I have to go somewhere a
15:35 - little bit later and then after that I
15:37 - have a meeting with my boss so the
15:39 - afternoon is going to be very full
15:47 - all right so let's check out this
15:52 - component so we're going to be in the
15:58 - index dot JSP in the pages folder so in
16:10 - the pages folder index and I'm gonna
16:14 - shut this because will mostly be working
16:18 - in here first so what we'll do is we'll
16:20 - we'll edit it directly in here get it
16:23 - looking like we want it to look and then
16:25 - maybe later on probably not on the
16:30 - stream maybe on the stream you'll see
16:32 - we'll turn it into its own component and
16:34 - make sure that it's customizable enough
16:36 - that we could use it for multiple things
16:42 - all right so right now we're using this
16:47 - built-in you know lists that is part of
16:50 - material UI we could keep using it
17:00 - oh sorry
17:04 - so let's yeah let's kind of see how what
17:12 - the limits are of this component and see
17:15 - if we can work with this to make it look
17:17 - the way we want it to look and if not
17:23 - then we could you know try to build
17:26 - something else so let's go back and just
17:33 - work within dev tools for a few minutes
17:35 - so let me adjust this a bit okay we're
17:50 - up here so the first thing I'd like to
17:53 - adjust then is this image yeah so this
18:00 - container for the image currently is the
18:03 - images are 40 by 40 and that's a bit too
18:08 - small let's see if we can go 60 you see
18:15 - how that looks
18:18 - whoops
18:25 - okay a bit bigger not too bad
18:30 - you know also I want to I want to check
18:33 - this out on my phone so we really want
18:39 - this to look good on a phone if you need
18:46 - to I'm gonna be constantly kind of going
18:48 - back to my phone so if you can check
18:51 - this out check out that n drop link on a
18:55 - phone that would be ideal and I'm just
19:01 - gonna copy this and send it to myself so
19:10 - that I don't have to type it up on my
19:13 - phone
19:31 - it's
19:38 - okay so now I can see this on my phone
19:42 - and obviously the changes I just made
19:45 - aren't gonna be visible on my phone
19:46 - because I just didn't dev tools but this
19:51 - gives me an idea of what those images
19:53 - look like on the phone and they do look
19:55 - way too small even on a phone let me
20:01 - know if you're getting a lot of weird
20:02 - noise from my phone being close to my
20:06 - mic if you are all try to do a better
20:09 - job of holding my phone farther away
20:14 - Michael is asking why not use the
20:16 - responsive mode and dev tools
20:17 - I do use the responsive mode sometimes
20:19 - but it just doesn't look the same as as
20:25 - a phone right and and to get that that
20:29 - real feeling of like the scroll and
20:31 - touching and stuff it it just doesn't
20:33 - give the same feedback so I like to
20:37 - actually look at it on my phone too
20:39 - you can also I mean it doesn't have to
20:42 - be an Grogg so you know potentially I
20:45 - could do this yet application no that's
20:51 - not it I can't remember where I guess
21:00 - I'm not gonna do it because I can't
21:01 - remember where to go I gotta set it up
21:04 - is it Network No
21:12 - I don't remember at all where to go to
21:19 - set this up did you remember where to go
21:31 - to to use a phone with dev tools
21:43 - open localhost 4040 all right let me
21:48 - check this out oh cool thanks are I
21:58 - didn't realize that you could get a nice
22:01 - UI like this with end rot that's pretty
22:05 - cool so I can see all the requests that
22:08 - are going through right now awesome
22:13 - anyway the 3w you used to be able to do
22:23 - there we are remote devices
22:28 - yeah that's have been uses throw up for
22:32 - a while so couldn't remember how I used
22:35 - to use this okay so that's for forward
22:39 - so 3088 alright cool that works so I
22:45 - should be able to go then too
22:47 - so for you or you can use Angra of
22:50 - course but for me since my phone is
22:53 - directly connected here I should be able
22:55 - to just go to ports while local hosts
23:08 - 8080 and I can see the the site here so
23:16 - I can't actually see it and the
23:20 - advantage of doing it this way is that
23:24 - changes I make in dev tools will show up
23:28 - automatically on on my phone so anyway
23:33 - just for those of you who want to do
23:35 - something like that when when you're
23:36 - developing then you can plug in your
23:40 - phone need to enable that
23:42 - so enable remote debugging which you can
23:45 - there documentation linked here and dev
23:48 - tools but so you go up here to your
23:53 - little menu and then go to more tools
23:56 - and remote devices there's a lot more
24:00 - tools here now than I remember there
24:02 - being the last time I checked this maybe
24:05 - I need to read those release notes more
24:07 - those there's what's new things here
24:11 - I always just skip over them because I'm
24:14 - usually in the middle of something okay
24:16 - anyway so I still think this is too
24:21 - small
24:34 - actually
24:41 - that's weird I thought I would
24:48 - automatically reflect changes on my
24:51 - phone but I guess it's not
25:00 - that's really weird
25:10 - hmm
25:13 - oh you know what I gotta open up another
25:16 - inspector that's why okay so here's the
25:21 - inspector that I can I need to change
25:24 - for my phone so maybe I won't do it like
25:26 - this because only I'll be able to see
25:30 - the changes right now unless I I guess
25:38 - unless I show my screen which I don't
25:41 - really want to go through all that right
25:42 - now okay so I'm just gonna stick with n
25:47 - grog on my phone so it'll be the same as
25:50 - as you all have anyway which might be
25:54 - better for the stream so if I was
26:04 - developing by myself and not doing a
26:06 - stream then I do recommend using dev
26:09 - tools and opening up that second dev
26:13 - tools window and then you can see the
26:15 - changes live you know right there in
26:17 - your phone it's a lot faster for now I'm
26:23 - just gonna do some changes here and
26:26 - since I'm not here we go see we'll
26:28 - switch over to this mode yeah let's just
26:37 - pick a phone iPhone 4 okay so we'll
26:40 - switch over here so it's kind of you
26:43 - know simulating a mobile device and then
26:46 - once we get some values that look like
26:49 - they'll work then we'll actually put
26:52 - them in to the react component and when
26:54 - I save then it'll update an end grukk so
26:56 - then we can all see it on our phones
27:03 - oh let's see how its set I should got
27:17 - timed out by the but it's funny I guess
27:33 - we have a bot now that stops people from
27:37 - spamming kapps so are all of our shits
27:42 - messages got deleted
27:44 - oh no oh whoa okay so watch out for that
27:52 - now everyone I suppose we have a button
27:55 - here now that might have been put in so
28:03 - since we're doing that 24 hours a day
28:05 - music stream I guess that was probably
28:09 - put in to stop people from spamming and
28:12 - in that channel so or on that stream I'm
28:17 - assuming so anyway so note no caps okay
28:25 - so this is a little bit bigger this
28:27 - might be too big yeah that's too big
28:36 - let's drop it down then let's go to 80
28:50 - I will try 80 and go over here I think
29:03 - all right list item is the class that we
29:06 - use let's go up here to our list item if
29:10 - you're not familiar with react there are
29:12 - lots of different ways to do styles this
29:14 - is one of the ways so we have a
29:15 - JavaScript object and we're putting our
29:18 - Styles inside that object so it's very
29:22 - similar to CSS but you can see the
29:26 - format is that of an object and not you
29:29 - know your normal CSS format so where's
29:31 - my list item
29:43 - did I read that wrong the class is list
29:49 - item that's odd
29:56 - so we have that class but I'm not seeing
29:59 - it up here
30:06 - that is what I want right listen that's
30:10 - our or would it be a versa maybe we need
30:16 - that on the avatar
30:24 - do we have styles coming in here no
30:32 - we're not adding any additional CSS so
30:36 - let's try to put a clasp right here on
30:40 - this have it's our last name and let's
30:48 - just call it avatar
30:58 - well you know what it looks like we're
31:00 - already adding some classes somewhere
31:03 - else let's find it there we are okay so
31:08 - we can put class names right there on
31:10 - the avatar alright so that should work
31:13 - then so let's go ahead and put it on a
31:18 - few more of these so I'm not worried
31:34 - about the formatting we have Auto format
31:36 - unsaved here so we should be fine after
31:42 - so I'm using that class that CSS class
31:47 - here as the key and then the value is
31:51 - going to be an object that has key value
31:54 - pairs and the key value pairs are going
31:57 - to reflect what we normally do and in
32:01 - CSS so in this case we're just going to
32:05 - do with height and so I'm gonna copy
32:07 - this to save time and you can see we've
32:13 - already done some things with great
32:15 - points here we may end up doing that
32:17 - again but for now I'm just worried about
32:18 - the mobile view so let's take this down
32:24 - to 80 and save it
32:31 - oops forgot a comma area and they don't
32:40 - like that comma there okay oops I
32:46 - thought I fixed that great
32:57 - for fresh area just didn't refresh
33:01 - automatically okay that looks alright I
33:07 - want to pull some data from actual
33:10 - events that we have so I'm just I'm
33:16 - gonna move this over on the other screen
33:17 - so I don't have to keep flipping back
33:19 - and forth and I'm gonna grab some some
33:25 - events that we actually have going on
33:26 - right now
33:45 - so let's go back here and put in Class A
33:54 - in this front one where we have our
33:58 - primary text I'm going to say in crisis
34:02 - American higher education and put in
34:11 - these are the actual events that are
34:14 - appearing on the home page of the
34:15 - website right now
34:29 - all right so
34:38 - oh yeah
34:43 - okay so let's see how this looks with
34:45 - actual titles okay not too bad this
34:51 - definitely needs to be larger I mean the
34:53 - font size needs to be larger this is too
34:56 - small especially if these are the titles
35:00 - so I'm gonna just hard code some fonts
35:07 - in here just to see what we want
35:09 - let's try 16 pixels which I guess is a
35:13 - default anyway 16 mm I wonder
35:33 - I really don't like the way this looks
35:36 - with the titles on a small screen here
35:44 - now I mean this is a very narrow phone
35:47 - most phones aren't going to be this
35:48 - narrow but still maybe maybe at some
35:55 - point when the screen so small we just
35:57 - don't include the images at all for
35:59 - events or we will have to come up with
36:02 - some other thing because I don't want to
36:04 - go very much smaller for these images it
36:07 - it'll be very hard to even see anything
36:10 - the other alternative is if for events
36:14 - let's say we don't use images at all but
36:17 - instead we we have a date actually the
36:23 - main site right now does not use images
36:26 - for the events they just have a little
36:28 - date icon maybe we should maybe we
36:34 - should do that we could potentially make
36:37 - the component so that if an image is
36:40 - passed to it then we do display an image
36:42 - otherwise it doesn't display the image
36:46 - so we'll still have a lot of flexibility
36:49 - and be able to reuse this component but
36:51 - in the case of events we'll be able to
36:57 - show more info how does that sound
37:04 - let me check my time all right about
37:07 - three minutes I want to see what
37:09 - feedback you all have about what I just
37:14 - explained
37:22 - and I am checking this out on my phone
37:31 - it doesn't look that bad on my phone and
37:34 - this is still with the smaller font size
37:36 - but the IMP
37:39 - the size the font size for the title is
37:42 - just so much smaller than the image is
37:44 - it it doesn't go together so we we
37:48 - definitely won't have any bigger images
37:49 - we need have a bigger font size and that
37:53 - just won't allow us to have very long
37:55 - titles without it looking weird so let
38:00 - me read off some of the suggestions here
38:02 - that some of your thoughts on this Nicki
38:05 - says what about a background image with
38:06 - text on top yeah we could think about
38:11 - that you know what this might be a
38:14 - really good time to check out how things
38:17 - like this are done in a material UI and
38:21 - other circumstances so maybe we'll take
38:25 - a look then not right now because we got
38:28 - a break coming up so I'll take
38:29 - five-minute break we'll go to the lab
38:31 - chat answer some questions and then when
38:32 - we come back maybe we'll take five
38:33 - minutes or so we'll look at the material
38:36 - design documentation and just see how
38:38 - they do lists and get some examples
38:43 - hopefully maybe we get some examples
38:46 - even of you know kind of news or events
38:52 - yeah there's probably some examples like
38:55 - that in the material design
38:57 - documentation already
39:05 - how Peter says do people even still have
39:08 - iPhone 4s I don't really know that was
39:10 - just the first thing on the list so I
39:11 - clicked hit but I mean it I think it's
39:16 - better to so this is I believe the
39:18 - narrowest tongue you can have is 320
39:21 - pixels so it's good to look at it there
39:25 - because if it looks if we can get it to
39:28 - look okay there it's probably still
39:30 - gonna look okay on a slightly larger
39:31 - phone okay all right so let me I'm gonna
39:41 - go ahead and just take the break now or
39:44 - start the timer for the break now I'm
39:45 - going to scroll up to the top and get
39:47 - through as many questions and comments
39:48 - as I can so if you have a question or
39:51 - comment please put it in the live chat
39:54 - now
40:05 - okay John Hanson said I'd like to see
40:07 - the border on the quote to be a bit more
40:11 - transparent she was talking about this
40:14 - quote yeah we could try a little bit
40:17 - more transparent at this point though I
40:20 - I'm gonna try to resist the temptation
40:24 - to make small changes like that just
40:26 - because of time so I'm gonna try to like
40:31 - put off of those changes for for later
40:34 - for after I have some of these
40:35 - presentations because if I can get right
40:40 - now if I get a few components to be
40:42 - exactly how I want it like a hundred
40:43 - percent done and I go to present it it's
40:47 - gonna look like it's not finished but if
40:48 - I get all the components let's say 90
40:51 - percent finished it's going to look like
40:53 - it's finished you most people won't even
40:56 - worry about details
41:12 - let's see Anna says this typing speed
41:15 - matter for coding
41:17 - Harshit says absolutely but tools like
41:22 - smart code editors help says code is all
41:27 - about typing logical stuff uh yeah I
41:30 - would I would add as well do you this
41:35 - typing speed matter I would say it's a
41:38 - little bit different so if you go to
41:40 - take a normal typing test for typing
41:43 - speed I think it's different than what a
41:49 - coder would type so the reason the
41:54 - reason is different is so normally as a
41:56 - coder you're hitting different keys than
41:58 - most people would hit right we don't do
42:00 - a lot of data entry we're entering you
42:03 - know long strings of text right we're
42:06 - grabbing data from api's and things all
42:09 - right so the keys that we hit are in odd
42:12 - places on the keyboard not only that but
42:16 - we do have a lot of help from editors
42:18 - right so we just need to type in the
42:20 - first few letters or something and then
42:22 - we hit tab and we're good to go
42:24 - so traditional typing speed I don't
42:28 - think is that important for coding so
42:31 - you know traditionally you have a
42:33 - paragraph you see how fast you can type
42:35 - the paragraph or something like that and
42:36 - it's all just you know normal words the
42:40 - only odd characters you would have or if
42:42 - there's a quotation mark question mark
42:45 - exclamation point period okay it's not
42:47 - not really a big deal but when coding
42:49 - it's it's almost reverse is you're using
42:52 - mostly special characters and very
42:55 - little you know strings of like normal
42:59 - words so I would say what could make up
43:03 - for if you're a slow typer what could
43:05 - definitely make up for it make it even
43:07 - faster than a fast typer encoding is if
43:09 - you get if you're very knowledgeable
43:11 - about all the keyboard shortcuts that
43:13 - you can use with your particular editor
43:15 - so if you are good with something let's
43:18 - say like Emmett which allows you to
43:19 - write your large amounts of HTML very
43:22 - quickly with just a few keystrokes
43:25 - then you could definitely you know code
43:28 - faster than somebody who may be a fast
43:30 - typer but doesn't take advantage of any
43:33 - shortcuts like that so my answer to that
43:38 - question of does typing speed matter for
43:41 - coding is maybe it depends it depends on
43:45 - on what you're doing and what would you
43:49 - take advantage of in terms of what
43:50 - editors can do so actually there was a
43:54 - question about this somewhere I can't
43:58 - remember where it was it was somewhere
44:02 - online there was a very similar question
44:04 - and someone was being kind of rude about
44:09 - the about it was it on I think was on
44:14 - the free code camp forum so there was
44:17 - one response on the forum that was I
44:19 - think kind of really made it seem like
44:25 - speed was very very important and I
44:30 - didn't I didn't agree so anyway but
44:34 - that's my opinion on the subject of of
44:37 - typing
44:45 - let me see okay my timer is up and I got
44:51 - through most of the questions
45:06 - okay there are a few follow-up comments
45:08 - I think with the the speed thing
45:17 - okay so Nikki says I hate my as AZERTY
45:21 - keyboard as opposed to the QWERTY
45:24 - keyboard so that's the the arrangement
45:27 - of the keys saying the special
45:29 - characters are not visible on my
45:31 - keyboard I said doesn't help I never
45:34 - realized that in assists thanks to the
45:37 - answer you're welcome and a no problem
45:41 - all right
45:42 - there's Ennis had one more follow-up
45:46 - question what are the top skills needed
45:49 - to get a front-end developer role HTML
45:53 - CSS JavaScript yeah you're gonna need
45:55 - that no matter what as a front-end
45:56 - developer and then depending on the job
45:58 - you might need to know a framework so a
46:01 - framework or library right so maybe the
46:05 - job you want they work with angular it
46:07 - would be good if you knew some angular
46:09 - same thing for react or ember or view or
46:13 - just jQuery so but you can't go wrong
46:18 - with being good with just regular
46:20 - JavaScript HTML CSS for sure now in
46:24 - terms of like other skills definitely
46:27 - need to be able to write reliable code
46:31 - being able to write tests is a big plus
46:34 - as well
46:34 - Harshit I know I don't write tests very
46:38 - much at all so before you say anything I
46:40 - realized that I'm not the best at this
46:42 - but I recognize it's important I'm
46:44 - trying to change right but that's a big
46:49 - thing and being able to teach yourself
46:51 - new things quickly is very very
46:55 - important I would much rather hire
46:57 - somebody as a developer who can
46:59 - demonstrate to me that they've been able
47:01 - to pick up new things and produce like
47:04 - production-ready code quickly then
47:07 - somebody who happens to be an expert
47:09 - right now but it's they're very
47:13 - resistant to change and don't like to
47:16 - learn new things
47:18 - right because everything's always going
47:20 - to change if they're an expert at
47:22 - whatever the big thing is right now it
47:24 - doesn't mean that they're going to be an
47:26 - expert at whatever the big thing is
47:27 - tomorrow so anyway that's what I would
47:31 - look for if I'm hiring a developer the
47:37 - in terms of their code you know you can
47:40 - prove that you know what you're doing
47:42 - that's from your projects right from
47:44 - what you have and get up it's a little
47:46 - bit harder to prove the other things
47:48 - about being able to learn quickly I mean
47:54 - there are some ways to do it right I
47:55 - actually like to see on a developer's
47:58 - github profile that they're doing
48:00 - tutorial courses as well so I like to
48:02 - see a mix of real projects for clients
48:05 - or at least like side projects that
48:07 - they're doing and then tutorial stuff
48:09 - even if they don't want to put it on the
48:11 - github I'd still like to see it on the
48:13 - resume and then if I can see like they
48:17 - did this boot camp let's say to learn
48:19 - react and then I look I've looked at the
48:22 - dates and said okay well like they
48:24 - graduated from this boot camp and then
48:26 - pretty much immediately had this
48:27 - production ready react that going to me
48:30 - that signals while they learned enough
48:32 - in that short amount of time to be able
48:33 - to build that that's impressive
48:36 - so there are some ways from the side of
48:39 - someone who's hiring that I try to tell
48:41 - if somebody is a quick learner
48:44 - so I'm keeping that in mind if you're on
48:47 - the other side and trying to get a job
48:49 - you know I would say don't be afraid to
48:54 - list that you've taken a course I mean
49:00 - be selective right maybe you not might
49:02 - not want to say like you know hey last
49:04 - month I took the intro to HTML course
49:07 - not a big deal but let's say if you took
49:09 - the advanced react course from wherever
49:12 - that might seem more impressive like hey
49:16 - you're trying to learn more right anyway
49:21 - hopefully that that makes sense that is
49:23 - decent advice if anyone disagrees please
49:25 - let me know in the live chat okay
49:30 - so let's go back let me take a second -
49:36 - I just I got a bunch of messages while I
49:41 - was talking I just kept hearing it buzz
49:43 - I just want to make sure it's nothing
49:44 - work-related that I need to handle I
49:50 - think this is not for me I'm a part of a
49:55 - team that handles like digital marketing
49:58 - stuff but I'm they're launching
50:00 - something today it's really important
50:02 - but I'm just kind of was like more of
50:04 - consulting on that project so I think
50:07 - most of the messages are about that but
50:09 - I don't have any direct responsibility
50:12 - yeah so that's it so sorry I don't I
50:15 - don't want to take the focus away from
50:17 - the stream but I just want to be ready
50:19 - in case they need help okay let me check
50:23 - the time all right we're still good I
50:25 - think we have time for one more Pomodoro
50:28 - session which I'll start right now and
50:30 - then I'm gonna keep an eye on the live
50:32 - chat if I notice there's a lot of
50:33 - questions in the live chat I might cut
50:35 - the Pomodoro session short so that I can
50:37 - get to all the questions but well we'll
50:44 - see hopefully I am not so focused I
50:48 - forget about the time all right so let's
50:52 - go into the events the last thing that
50:54 - we were talking about was kind of
50:55 - switching up how we do this and let's
51:03 - see
51:06 - yeah let's let's take out this image and
51:11 - then add in a date yeah I think that
51:18 - would be better to add in a more
51:20 - prominent date and not have images for
51:23 - events okay I do see a few more
51:30 - questions if you're just joining and
51:31 - asking a question just hold on after in
51:35 - about 25 minutes I'm gonna go back and
51:37 - answer all the questions so just be
51:40 - patient for a little while longer I'll
51:42 - definitely get to your questions all
51:47 - right let me get rid of this give us
51:49 - some more space yeah so I'm gonna go in
51:52 - here then and take out these list items
51:58 - oops not the whole thing
52:00 - I'm just gonna take out these avatars
52:03 - which it should be the same yep they're
52:06 - all the same so I can remove them all at
52:09 - once and save it now let's see what its
52:14 - gonna look like area okay so now it
52:18 - looks like this which is also not ideal
52:20 - oh you know what I forgot what we were
52:22 - gonna do I was going to go to the
52:24 - material design documentation so
52:35 - material dot iOS material design website
52:38 - just go to our guidelines and let's see
52:45 - if they have a list area lists so we
52:48 - actually have two different lists we
52:50 - have a grid list as well so let's just
52:53 - check out the regular list for right now
52:54 - see these are the lists that actually
52:57 - you know they do have this circular
52:58 - image here and as I said earlier it
53:01 - works really well with with like
53:05 - portraits right so just somebody's face
53:08 - and maybe a little bit of their upper
53:10 - body but with larger you know images
53:14 - like the type of images you might want
53:16 - to have with an event see maybe you
53:18 - don't want somebody's face
53:19 - if somebody is a speaker giving a talk
53:21 - yeah that's fine but you know not all
53:24 - the events are like that
53:26 - so you know might not be bad to have an
53:30 - icon if the events fell into certain
53:36 - categories we could have maybe an icon
53:38 - for each category
53:39 - I guess that's an option
53:48 - all right see you see how we have here
53:51 - this is what I was thinking that would
53:52 - work is if we had a title short
53:56 - description and then some sort of image
54:00 - but I'm just not so sure that we have
54:05 - the space for that we could I mean we do
54:09 - have more padding than we really need
54:12 - right here that kid could give it us a
54:16 - little bit more space Michael said is G
54:20 - fuel time hey I happen to have some G
54:24 - fuel ready right here let me say if you
54:29 - don't stake it up after it's been
54:30 - sitting it's not this is not as good so
54:33 - just the pro tip for you there if you
54:36 - want to use G fuel all right Nickey says
54:46 - the grid list in material design looks
54:48 - cool all right let's check out the grid
54:50 - list so I want to spend too much time on
54:52 - the list so we'll give it just a little
54:54 - scroll here just to see what else is
54:57 - here
55:03 - all right this is maybe more what will
55:05 - end up with something like this without
55:07 - the image all right now let's check the
55:10 - grid list if you haven't checked through
55:15 - this documentation before I highly
55:17 - recommend it if you're at all interested
55:18 - in material design its it's just really
55:23 - really useful oh okay here's the grid
55:28 - list yeah I'm not sure
55:46 - see
55:50 - if we do this we definitely we can't do
55:53 - image only we would need to have the
55:56 - title maybe something more like this but
56:08 - I I kind of I suspect that my boss will
56:12 - want more area for more an area for text
56:16 - you know this just really doesn't give
56:18 - us that much space and if we did add
56:21 - more text that would cover you know
56:23 - pretty much the whole image with text so
56:28 - hmm yeah I really do like this look
56:35 - though I want to keep this in mind in
56:36 - case there's somewhere else on the site
56:38 - where we could utilize something like
56:40 - this I think that's nice it it will
56:43 - require though that we have images you
56:46 - know I you can really use this if only
56:49 - some of what you're putting in here has
56:52 - a good image okay
56:58 - this list controls okay
57:10 - ya don't need that actually if we were
57:17 - to have some sort of control on the list
57:20 - what I would want to have is like
57:25 - something where you could quickly add
57:26 - this to a calendar that would be useful
57:32 - potentially if we can't work it in here
57:34 - we could have it so that when you click
57:36 - it takes you to the event page gives you
57:39 - more info and then you can add it to
57:41 - your calendar there but really it saves
57:44 - users from having to go to another page
57:48 - if we could put it in here so I think it
57:51 - should be in there if we can so let's
57:56 - let's think about this for a second in
57:58 - terms of how much space we're using when
58:03 - we're on a screen this small do we want
58:06 - to keep the cards like fully have the
58:08 - cards or do we want to change it so that
58:11 - you know we're completely full full
58:15 - width and we're still going to have two
58:20 - separate sections out somehow
58:27 - I don't know maybe we should take a look
58:31 - you know soon I'm saying here like let's
58:33 - say we were in a nap right there's no
58:36 - cards here these these aren't cards not
58:40 - I mean this is within a list
58:53 - Nicki's asking about icons for material
58:56 - actually let's take a look at the icons
58:59 - oops
59:09 - hi Khan's alright so there are a ton of
59:14 - free material design icons under which
59:21 - link
59:22 - alright so let's say I look at the
59:26 - calendar
59:27 - okay so date yeah there's nothing in
59:34 - there those ones aren't really working
59:37 - oops bad are there's a nice add to
59:42 - shopping cart there's an add an alert at
59:44 - a notes yeah but there's not already an
59:48 - ADD calendar
59:53 - yes we'd have to think about it
60:07 - yeah let's see so I mean some apps it's
60:15 - actually not even consistent because
60:17 - some Google apps that are using material
60:20 - design have cards within it so I'm
60:24 - thinking of you maybe like the news the
60:29 - newsstand app so if you are material or
60:37 - I'm sorry an Android phone and you check
60:39 - out the newsstand app there are there
60:45 - cards I mean they change they change
60:47 - this somewhat frequently so it could be
60:50 - different but like the first set of cars
60:52 - the briefing is one large card that's
60:55 - that's basically a list which which kind
60:58 - of matches up with something that we do
61:00 - here and actually this format's not bad
61:04 - for news and events if we switched it up
61:07 - and use a similar format hmm that's
61:15 - really interesting
61:22 - I'm sorry I need to like show you all
61:26 - this this format
61:35 - alright so basically there's two
61:36 - different formats that are using in the
61:38 - newsstand app for displaying basically
61:42 - an image some icons and but yeah
61:49 - actually it's just now some of them have
61:51 - a title and they have a description it
61:54 - looks like if there's a large a long
61:56 - title they don't have the description
62:01 - yeah so some do some some zone all right
62:05 - but they have two different formats so
62:06 - let me try to explain this so basically
62:17 - at first they do have a card and it does
62:23 - have padding on the side so they have a
62:25 - large card like this they have the title
62:29 - here but then they have the image here
62:34 - and a few icons actually three icons
62:38 - underneath one for sharing ones a little
62:41 - menu icon and the other one is to
62:43 - bookmark it and then they have a you
62:49 - know optional description it looks like
62:50 - under here and then each item is
62:54 - separated by like a horizontal line here
62:58 - very light grey horizontal line and then
63:02 - as you scroll down it switches over and
63:04 - they have these cards that are full
63:07 - width but they still have the separation
63:10 - and this material design style shadow
63:12 - between them but they are full width in
63:17 - there more like this where they have the
63:19 - image up here and then it's I title and
63:23 - then text and then the the icons for
63:28 - those cards are down at the bottom here
63:37 - so actually either one of those formats
63:42 - will work once again though it's I think
63:45 - it's just a question of will we have
63:47 - appropriate images that will work for
63:50 - something like that and for the events
63:55 - currently we don't so I don't really
63:57 - know I don't know if we have the content
64:01 - to back up that type of design
64:19 - i misspelled newsstand I did
64:29 - 20:16
64:36 - all right it's always dangerous just
64:38 - clicking on the image tab but you never
64:42 - know it's gonna come up but I just want
64:44 - to show you all all right this looks
64:50 - this isn't exactly what I'm saying
64:54 - this looks like maybe an older version
64:55 - but somewhat similar yeah actually
65:04 - that's definitely an older an older
65:06 - version let's see this looks newer yeah
65:12 - okay so this is that first section here
65:16 - where it's one big card this is what I
65:19 - was thinking might work for us so what
65:26 - do you all think about something like
65:27 - this for the events and actually if we
65:34 - don't have an image this section here
65:37 - could maybe just have the month in the
65:40 - day maybe that's maybe that maybe month
65:46 - and day I don't know if we could fit in
65:48 - the time in here and it's still have it
65:50 - look right yeah
66:01 - I mean we definitely have to abandon
66:04 - some of what's already there in the list
66:06 - and kind of redo it which I mean we've
66:09 - done that before so it'll be a little
66:12 - bit more work but this this might work I
66:16 - mean obviously we don't need all these
66:19 - icons and we don't need this part here
66:24 - and we don't need the numbers either it
66:32 - looks like looks like the horizontal
66:35 - line doesn't actually extend all the way
66:37 - out to the sides I actually like that I
66:44 - like that it doesn't extend out all
66:52 - right let me see I did I said I was
66:55 - gonna try to keep a watch on the live
66:58 - chat to see how many questions we have
67:04 - okay not a ton of questions let's try to
67:09 - do just a little bit of work here on
67:11 - this to make it look so I'm not getting
67:15 - a lot of feedback on on what you all
67:18 - think about this so I'm gonna move ahead
67:20 - since there's no strong objections to it
67:25 - I'm gonna go ahead with something like
67:28 - this not exactly but it's something like
67:31 - this okay I'm gonna move this to my
67:40 - other screen so I can keep an eye on it
67:46 - this is kind of an advantage I think of
67:49 - using something like material design is
67:51 - it so widely used that you can get kind
67:57 - of inspiration from other places about
67:59 - how to handle certain content types
68:02 - so you're not completely on your own so
68:06 - and I don't I don't mean like copying
68:08 - other people you know you'll see
68:10 - whenever we make this we're not it's not
68:12 - gonna look exactly the same you know but
68:15 - it definitely helps to be able to look
68:18 - at something else and say okay I liked
68:19 - how they did it this way or you know
68:21 - maybe this will work for what we're
68:23 - doing and you usually have to adapt it
68:27 - but it just kind of helps when you're
68:30 - when you're stuck and you don't really
68:32 - have an idea for how you want to do
68:34 - something all right so I'd like to use
68:40 - as much of what we already have as
68:41 - possible as long as it doesn't make it
68:45 - too difficult okay not bad let's switch
68:50 - over maybe we can switch over that
68:57 - avatar section to the other side let's
69:04 - try that first all right let me just
69:11 - back up here a second let's get rid of
69:15 - this here and then we'll move it here
69:26 - right yeah see what it looks like okay
69:35 - cool easy enough we don't want it to be
69:38 - a circle right so let's see where where
69:44 - do we have just want to see where we
69:49 - actually have the border radius
69:56 - I guess it's on the container yeah all
70:01 - right so we'll change the border radius
70:03 - here and so on our classes avatar which
70:13 - we set a width and height let's also set
70:17 - a border border radius of zero we don't
70:25 - need the quotation mark since it's just
70:28 - you know a number but this may or may
70:32 - not work we'll see since it looks like
70:33 - they define its materiai define each
70:36 - border radius separately I'm not sure if
70:39 - we'll override that oh it did work
70:41 - awesome cool okay so we do have now a
70:46 - square image just great that's what I
70:50 - wanted and I think I do think we need
70:55 - just overall on a smaller screen we need
70:59 - less padding so may as well do that now
71:10 - let's figure out where we're putting
71:12 - that padding in and what component
71:23 - okay so maybe on that grid let's check
71:35 - grid item fix is the class so let's
71:39 - check out our grid item fix okay and we
71:42 - do have a 16 pixel padding so it looks
71:46 - like we can grab this and reuse it here
71:54 - and this is basically like using a media
71:59 - query but this is comes built-in in a
72:02 - material UI so it's a little odd doesn't
72:06 - look like a normal media query let's add
72:12 - padding
72:23 - sooo padding-left let's see if we want
72:28 - to keep the 16 wonder if we want to keep
72:34 - it this much space in between or not
72:44 - this ends up being yeah I don't think we
72:48 - want that much space because we're doing
72:50 - 16 all around then we end up getting 32
72:53 - pixels between I think I'd feel better
72:55 - with 16 pixels in between so let's
72:57 - change that and these on the small
72:59 - screen has changed it so let's drop this
73:03 - down padding all around just to 8 pixels
73:11 - and that should give us what we want
73:16 - there okay see so now there's only
73:21 - there's a total of 16 pixels in between
73:23 - and now we have a much more slim eight
73:29 - pixels on each side so that gives us a
73:32 - bit more space so it's still enough that
73:35 - we can see it's a card and we can
73:38 - definitely see separation between cards
73:41 - but yeah I like that let me know if you
73:47 - don't like that or you have different
73:49 - suggestion for that but I think that's
73:51 - that's nice there's no sense in taking
73:53 - up extra space when you already have a
73:55 - really small small screen let me check
73:59 - the time okay that's all I'm gonna do
74:02 - for now we're almost out of time for
74:04 - this Pomodoro session and I did notice
74:06 - some questions so I want to get to the
74:07 - questions
74:09 - so let me commit someone you ought to be
74:14 - able to see these changes so let me
74:17 - commit this now and let's say it's your
74:35 - and really I do the biggest change that
74:42 - I made really was the change that I just
74:45 - did there and changing the padding of
74:49 - the card so that's what I'm gonna put on
74:51 - the commit message the next commit
74:53 - message will probably be all those
74:55 - changes that we're making because we
75:03 - didn't we didn't really do that much we
75:04 - just changed the position of the picture
75:06 - within the events card all right so
75:10 - let's see
75:24 - [Music]
75:30 - I will probably get that yeah we're
75:32 - gonna get that error again warning so I
75:35 - keep saying it's an error but it's a
75:37 - warning if it was an error we wouldn't
75:39 - be able to commit origin okay all right
75:47 - so now everything should be available on
75:49 - github the end Rock server is still up
75:52 - so you can still check it out if you if
75:54 - you need to let me scroll up and try to
75:59 - answer as many questions as I can
76:01 - hopefully I have enough time to get
76:03 - through all of them
76:18 - sym Ranji says how is your pixel phone's
76:22 - performance I've been very happy with my
76:24 - pixel it's the the pixel excel pixel one
76:28 - excel and it's been great there are some
76:33 - things that that are weird and but I'm
76:37 - not sure if it's a pixel problem or if
76:39 - it's a problem with that particular app
76:42 - so I've had trouble with Instagram just
76:45 - freezing up on me and crashing I've had
76:48 - trouble with only certain things and
76:51 - Facebook not working and just the
76:53 - loading wheel keep spinning
76:56 - but like it's I don't know
76:59 - is that a pixel thing is that you know
77:02 - because of the app I'm not sure but
77:04 - overall I've I've been happy with with
77:08 - the pixel
77:35 - all right so Shri Ganesh says I'm
77:40 - learning angular will it be difficult to
77:42 - switch to react later I'm I don't really
77:47 - know from experience because I I did
77:50 - very little with angular before I
77:52 - started learning react but I assume that
77:55 - someone who is capable of learning
77:57 - angular is certainly capable of learning
78:00 - reacts so there may be certain concepts
78:03 - that will be more difficult if you're
78:05 - used to angular and this is just my
78:07 - guess I'm not a hundred percent sure but
78:09 - but if you're intelligent enough and you
78:13 - know able to learn enough to do one
78:16 - framework to switch to a different
78:18 - library like reacts shouldn't be a big
78:21 - problem so I wouldn't worry too much
78:23 - about it but like anything it's just
78:26 - going to take practice gonna take effort
78:29 - in time
78:36 - Evos has just joined in and I was
78:38 - wondering how the Pomodoro timer helps
78:40 - you besides not going too long one of
78:45 - the unexpected helps of using Pomodoro
78:49 - timer to break up my work is that I do
78:53 - my 25-minute session and then I take my
78:56 - break in that break time sometimes so I
79:00 - try not to think about what I'm doing so
79:02 - sometimes I'll think about something
79:04 - else and it just puts my work in
79:06 - perspective and it stops me from
79:09 - spending too much time on one task that
79:11 - maybe isn't that important so I don't
79:13 - know if this has happened to any of you
79:14 - but occasionally I'll get stuck on some
79:17 - problem and I'll keep working at it and
79:19 - working at it for hours trying to fix
79:21 - this problem but in reality the problem
79:26 - isn't that important and I could just do
79:29 - like a workaround or just remove that
79:31 - feature or do something different and it
79:34 - would have saved a lot of time and in
79:36 - the big picture it probably would have
79:38 - been better just to do it that way so
79:41 - that five minute break really allows me
79:43 - to recognize when I'm in a situation
79:46 - like that a lot faster
79:48 - than I normally would and just kind of
79:51 - switch things up so to me that's been a
79:56 - big benefit you know other than the
79:58 - obvious time management benefits that
80:00 - you get from you know the Pomodoro
80:02 - Technique so anyway I should really do a
80:06 - video on on Pomodoro at some point on my
80:10 - channel so it's not are already on my
80:13 - list maybe I'll add it Gerardo says do
80:27 - you think it's worth fixing github
80:29 - commits aha
80:31 - for a side project for myself I never
80:34 - bother fixing github commits
80:37 - occasionally I do to me I want to say it
80:42 - depends on who's going to be looking at
80:43 - those commits and what it's for really
80:47 - so I don't I don't have a rule that
80:49 - covers everything hmm
80:52 - so I but yeah so it just it kind of
80:57 - depends and it depends on how much I
80:59 - messed up the commit so sorry I can't
81:03 - give you like a rule that would work but
81:06 - if the commits really messed up then
81:09 - yeah maybe you know you laugh and fix it
81:12 - but in general as long as the commit is
81:15 - still readable it still makes sense if
81:17 - it's just a small error I'll usually
81:19 - just leave it I mean it would depend
81:22 - like if I was you know committing
81:26 - something to a repo that had pretty
81:28 - strict rules about it obviously I would
81:30 - I would want to fix it
81:32 - Gerardo says I have two accounts work in
81:35 - home and my work ones are not reflected
81:37 - as being mine I have to patch the entire
81:39 - repos I'm afraid I might end up ruining
81:42 - everything
81:50 - yeah
81:59 - I'm not sure how to handle a I don't
82:04 - know anybody else have any advice but
82:05 - I'm sorry drawer - I'm trying to think
82:07 - I'm also I'm trying to get all the
82:11 - questions in - and I have just a few
82:13 - more minutes to do that so if I had more
82:17 - time again think about it a bit more
82:22 - yeah I mean you definitely want to try
82:24 - to get credit for what you're doing
82:36 - let's see let me look at some of the
82:37 - other questions the five-time I'll come
82:39 - back to that as well
82:53 - in s how long have you been coding for
82:56 - about five years I'd learned coding some
83:01 - coding stuff a lot you know longer
83:05 - I learned it a lot farther back than
83:08 - five years I started coding in in high
83:11 - school and like the early 2000s early to
83:14 - mid-2000s and but I didn't do a lot with
83:20 - it
83:21 - but I've been kind of more seriously
83:23 - coding for about the past five years
83:33 - Aniki says I really like that text the
83:36 - left image to the right the text is
83:38 - what's actually important the image is
83:40 - there for extra flavor oh that's a good
83:42 - way to put it I you know what I like
83:45 - that now that you say it it makes
83:47 - perfect sense
83:48 - I you know I'm sure like I picked up on
83:55 - you know like I picked up on hey I like
83:57 - this but it didn't like come to me that
84:01 - that's why I like it but now that you
84:03 - say it like that that's exactly right
84:04 - the emphasis is on the right part of the
84:09 - content see Mert says why why the free
84:19 - code camp always put emphasis on the
84:20 - front end for this stream in particular
84:25 - I mean I'm a front-end developer
84:26 - although I do some back-end stuff you
84:29 - know from time to time so that's why I
84:32 - emphasize front-end stuff because that's
84:34 - most of what I do free code camp in
84:37 - general I don't I don't know do they
84:42 - emphasize front anymore I'd have to go
84:46 - back and check I mean I know their
84:49 - challenges certainly they have
84:51 - challenges for back-end in their YouTube
84:54 - videos it might be the case that friend
84:57 - gets emphasized more but I guess I just
85:03 - never really thought about it
85:06 - so I don't know that as far as you know
85:14 - I'm concerned I don't there's no effort
85:16 - on my part to emphasize front or back
85:18 - end I just do what I have to do for work
85:21 - and I try to stream as much as I can of
85:25 - course both are very important for for
85:29 - web development let's see all right so I
85:35 - am gonna have to go here in just a
85:37 - minute or two Gerardo I guess I still
85:44 - don't have a great answer for your
85:45 - situation my thing is you know is there
85:47 - any way if you say you have two accounts
85:51 - your work account on your home account
85:53 - I'm assuming these are github accounts
85:54 - right is there any way I mean does your
86:03 - work account have your name on it
86:05 - associated with it if so then you would
86:09 - be getting credit for your projects on
86:10 - your work account right is there any way
86:15 - you know when you want to let people
86:17 - know what you've worked on that you
86:19 - could have both of your accounts listed
86:21 - I mean obviously it's not ideal but at
86:29 - least you would have the benefit of
86:31 - getting credit for what you're doing
86:33 - without having to change anything or
86:35 - potentially mess up you know any repos
86:38 - so I don't know if that's an option for
86:40 - you but maybe I don't know you know
86:48 - maybe that could work
86:53 - Mert Mert says that's what I feel this
86:56 - is a follow-up to the front-end emphasis
86:59 - question but it says that's what if you
87:01 - want to follow the instruction on the
87:02 - site thanks for answering my question oh
87:04 - yeah no problem yeah I mean sorry I
87:06 - couldn't answer it you know more fully I
87:08 - really don't have anything to do with
87:12 - the creating of the curriculum in all
87:16 - the challenges
87:18 - so so I can't answer for sure what the
87:21 - thinking was before that for for that
87:24 - part of it I mean there are the
87:27 - curriculum is guess like the next
87:31 - version of it is coming out soon so
87:34 - maybe things might be different then I'm
87:36 - not sure but you might want to check it
87:38 - out when the new version comes out as
87:40 - well and see if there's more balance
87:43 - between front end and back end all right
87:47 - so my my calendar is reminding me that I
87:50 - need to leave in one minute okay now
87:52 - let's reminding me that I lead need to
87:54 - leave now so thank you all so much for
87:58 - watching and thanks for all your help
88:00 - and all your questions and I should be
88:04 - back I'll probably be back tomorrow I'm
88:07 - gonna start having a lot more meetings
88:09 - than normal this week and then next week
88:12 - so the times that I stream might be a
88:15 - little off I may not be able to stream
88:16 - every day but I'll do my best to fit
88:18 - them in and so until next time have a
88:24 - wonderful day
