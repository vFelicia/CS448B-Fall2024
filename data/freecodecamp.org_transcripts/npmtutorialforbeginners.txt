00:00 - what's going on my name is Jay and in
00:02 - this video I want to show you what is
00:04 - NPM and how you can use it so let's get
00:07 - into it if you go to NPM jegs.com you
00:11 - will see this page and here's a little
00:15 - bit of you know a very quick description
00:17 - about NPM NPM is a node package manager
00:20 - okay
00:21 - so short description is reusable code
00:25 - like people around the world are
00:27 - creating this packages full of cool code
00:30 - that you can use for your project v4 we
00:33 - start using NPM we're gonna need node.js
00:36 - because NPM comes with node.js and
00:39 - that's why it's called a node package
00:41 - manager so if you go to node.js org make
00:45 - sure you go scroll it a bit and then you
00:48 - will see some buttons that you can
00:50 - download and then after that you can
00:51 - install node in your computer after node
00:55 - is installed completely in your computer
00:58 - please go ahead and open your command
01:01 - line alright and I want you to write
01:06 - node - V hit enter all right and if you
01:12 - see this like a version that means that
01:15 - you have node in your computer and there
01:17 - are showing you their version after that
01:20 - let's make sure that we have NPM so
01:22 - let's do the same thing but with NPM now
01:26 - as we hit enter same thing if you see a
01:29 - version right here that's because you
01:32 - have NPM in the computer and you're good
01:36 - to go perfect so let's clear these out
01:40 - all right so now I'm gonna minimize this
01:44 - let's go here for a minute I have a new
01:48 - index.html file it's empty the only
01:51 - thing I'm doing is requesting this main
01:53 - J's file which is right here is totally
01:57 - empty so let's start playing with it
02:01 - let's create a variable here called my
02:03 - date
02:05 - and it's gonna be equal to today's date
02:08 - so let's do new date and this is gonna
02:13 - give us like today's date like right now
02:16 - let's console.log let's make sure this
02:18 - is working save it
02:24 - let's go this is my page which is
02:26 - totally empty let's reload the page
02:29 - perfect it's working it says my day just
02:33 - right here now I do not like this format
02:36 - I want to change it so I'm gonna use one
02:41 - of these node modules so let's go back
02:44 - here and it's called moment there's my
02:50 - favorite like if oh if I want to format
02:52 - and I want something very very easy to
02:55 - read like a very easy to read date
02:57 - moment is my favorite so I'm just gonna
03:00 - click here and here you can see is that
03:04 - install any the only thing that is
03:05 - telling use NPM I movement the I is for
03:09 - install all right that's all we need if
03:12 - you want to use this so let's go to the
03:17 - command line again and before we get
03:21 - started and you know we start installing
03:24 - all these modules or packages let's make
03:27 - sure that we are in the correct folder
03:28 - which I am NOT so write down CD space go
03:35 - ahead find a folder of your project drag
03:38 - and drop it all right here you'll see

04:14 - alright and now this is gonna create a
04:17 - very important file for your prod
04:19 - is gonna start asking you some questions
04:21 - like your package name right I'm gonna
04:23 - hit enter the version I'm gonna enter
04:26 - description I'm just gonna hit enter to
04:28 - everything because I don't want to spend
04:29 - time like I'm writing all this down but
04:33 - if you're serious and you're creating
04:35 - like a they're very very good parts in a
04:37 - project that you're gonna share with the
04:39 - world make sure you put this down
04:43 - alright I'm good with that
04:45 - yes hit enter okay and now if you go
04:49 - back to your project you will see this

05:00 - project okay
05:01 - so make sure you have this there that's
05:05 - very important and now we are ready to
05:07 - actually use NPM so let's go ahead just
05:10 - go back here let me clear this all right
05:17 - I'm gonna just copy let's go back I'm
05:26 - gonna paste it and I'm gonna hit enter
05:32 - alright cool if you see these warnings
05:35 - don't worry about it it's because I

05:40 - know there's a lot of empty fields
05:42 - alright
05:43 - so that's not a problem so moment if you
05:47 - go back you will see now note modules
05:50 - and you open that you will see moment
05:52 - here which is what we want do not worry
05:56 - about node modules right now if you
05:58 - don't understand it there is a link of
06:00 - the description if you want to learn
06:02 - more about them but you don't have to
06:04 - worry about this folder right now
06:05 - there's another file right now it's
06:08 - called packet lock Jason dot Jason and
06:11 - this file is important because this is
06:14 - the one that's telling every single
06:16 - detail about everything that you're
06:17 - installing so if you install moment a
06:21 - moment they're telling you and all the
06:25 - details about
06:26 - package okay you don't have to worry
06:29 - about that file right now but is
06:31 - important that you have it there all
06:33 - right so now I'm gonna go ahead I'm
06:35 - gonna go to moment J yes and see the
06:38 - documentation see how we can use it all
06:41 - right so let's go here let me open this
06:46 - a little bit more all right
06:48 - I'm gonna click Doc's were to use it and
06:52 - it says no J yes perfect that's what
06:55 - that's what we did and what we're using
06:58 - and here they'll tell you what you need
07:00 - to do so we need to add this create a
07:04 - variable with the require moment so
07:07 - let's do that let's do it up here all
07:16 - right cool I'm gonna save it and now
07:19 - they're telling us to use this like
07:21 - moment format all right so after my date
07:26 - is my variable date is created I'm just
07:28 - gonna put down here and try a new
07:30 - variable let's call it my cool date
07:36 - equals to moment and inside moment we're
07:42 - gonna put the date and then we need to
07:47 - put whatever format we want to let's go
07:50 - back to the website a moment here and I
07:53 - want to see what formats so we have all
07:56 - these formats look and they're telling
07:58 - us let me open this a little bit more
08:00 - they're showing us all the formats every
08:03 - single one so let's use something like
08:06 - this I like this one it's very clean
08:09 - people can understand it's just like a
08:11 - double uppercase ll so let's do it save
08:16 - it and let's console.log my cool date
08:24 - all right let's do this
08:28 - this reload the page yes so now we have
08:34 - an error here is saying require is not
08:38 - defined so this require right here the
08:43 - browser doesn't understand what is it
08:45 - like what is required so if you're a
08:50 - beginner nodejs is a server-side
08:54 - technology so right now we're using all
08:57 - this in our browser and it's not gonna
09:00 - work so for that we need something that
09:02 - is gonna get our main j/s get everything
09:06 - all the code that we have here bundle
09:09 - create a bundle that way the browser can
09:12 - understand we can use something called
09:15 - browser file which I like a lot you can
09:20 - use something called web pack too which
09:23 - I love but for now we're gonna use
09:26 - browser fire it's very easy to do it
09:28 - right now and you can see is telling us
09:29 - browser for unless you require models in
09:31 - the browser and all we need to do is
09:35 - install this right and it's using NPM so
09:39 - let's go ahead and copy open the command
09:43 - line again paste it alright so now i'm
09:50 - browserify is available for us and we
09:53 - can use it so let's close this and let's
09:57 - go ahead and and scroll it a bit down so
10:00 - here you can see how we can get our J's
10:03 - file and create a bundle that we can
10:06 - actually use so let's copy this let's go
10:13 - here to our command line and let's paste
10:16 - it MiFi is called main J's but if yours
10:20 - is called something else just change it
10:22 - and that's it all that's all you need to
10:24 - do and it doesn't have to be bundled yes
10:26 - it can be something else so let's hit
10:29 - enter all right now let's go back and
10:33 - see if browser if I created
10:36 - bundling yeah here's a new file click on
10:39 - it and you will see a bunch of code here
10:42 - okay so you can see that we have all the
10:46 - things that we created and then we have
10:48 - all the code for moment and we're going
10:50 - to have here a code for everything all
10:53 - right so all I'm gonna do is go to my in
10:56 - index dot HTML I'm gonna go and change
10:59 - it to bundle dot yeah yes okay now let's
11:05 - reload and now take a look now is
11:09 - actually working the browser understand
11:11 - our code and now it's like September
11:14 - 23rd 2018 looks a beautiful perfect all
11:21 - right so now let's go ahead and install
11:23 - this unique one right so let's go ahead
11:28 - NPM let me clear this okay so ampion
11:37 - install unique perfect now we have that
11:43 - available for us so let's go the same
11:48 - thing is gonna be a require here I'm
11:51 - gonna put it here after them after a
11:54 - moment and they're giving us an example
11:56 - here from the array so what unique is
11:59 - gonna do for us is that if we have a
12:01 - list if we have an array and we have a
12:04 - lot of things there and we have a lot of
12:07 - a lot of numbers or strengths that are
12:09 - the same and we don't want to we can use
12:12 - unique so let's do it something very
12:14 - very quick here so the variable equals
12:19 - my list equals to this an array this is
12:26 - one two one one one let's say for
12:30 - example we're repeating a lot of ones
12:31 - that we do not want so three three four
12:36 - five six and then another four not four
12:39 - and seven this is a quick example that
12:42 - we have a lot of numbers here that we do
12:44 - not want right and now we can do is
12:49 - I'm gonna put my unique list equals to
12:58 - because he's gonna be unique and then
13:02 - inside unique I'm gonna just put my list
13:06 - which is all this all right and I'm
13:12 - gonna console.log my unique list and
13:16 - let's see if this works so I'm gonna
13:18 - save it and now we need to go and which
13:23 - is um something that I don't want to do
13:28 - you can actually automate this instead
13:32 - of doing it manually but for now I'm
13:33 - doing it manually every time you save
13:35 - this Jes fire we have to go to your
13:37 - command line and make sure you run this
13:41 - that way this bundle yes get created
13:45 - again with your new code now you don't
13:48 - have to do it manually you can use a lot
13:50 - of things to automate this that way
13:52 - every time you save this file is done
13:54 - automatically okay I'm gonna hit enter
13:58 - perfect and now let's reload this page
14:03 - alright and now we have an array one two
14:06 - three four five six seven you can see
14:09 - that we do not have all this wants and
14:14 - this extra three and this extra fours we
14:18 - don't have done so that's a cool thing
14:19 - about all this packages and non modules
14:24 - that you can use for your project and
14:27 - that's it
14:28 - thank you so much for watching half a
14:30 - beautiful day bye bye
