00:00 - one of the hardest things on your path
00:02 - to becoming a developer and learning to
00:04 - code is
00:05 - consistency this is probably the
00:08 - number one thing people would say when
00:10 - learning code is it's about
00:12 - repetition it's about doing it every day
00:13 - it's about working at it um again and
00:16 - again and again and um you know if you
00:18 - don't take any breaks you're gonna get
00:20 - there much quicker than if you do take
00:21 - breaks and so consistency is something
00:23 - that a lot of people struggle with in
00:25 - all aspects of their life so i'm gonna
00:26 - talk to you about five ways that when i
00:28 - was learning to be a self-taught dev
00:31 - i i
00:33 - made sure that i was able to code every
00:34 - day i was consistent with my my learning
00:37 - and that i was able to finally uh just
00:41 - get it right and just finally
00:43 - grab and understand oh my god it's
00:45 - starting to click these are things that
00:46 - i made sure so that i had a consistent
00:48 - path
00:51 - [Music]
00:58 - so the first thing is about getting rid
01:00 - of distractions eliminating things
01:02 - oftentimes
01:03 - you are trying to make a career change
01:05 - you are trying to make a life change and
01:08 - uh learning code and all those things so
01:10 - it's a it's a big change and you need to
01:13 - sort of refactor some of your life to
01:14 - make to make it a change that will
01:17 - actually last and so you need to start
01:19 - getting rid of distractions as that's
01:21 - really the first thing that i did and
01:24 - those were a couple different categories
01:25 - of distractions and um you know some of
01:27 - you may disagree say you know dylan
01:30 - i don't want to get rid of all that it
01:32 - sounds like you're getting rid of all
01:33 - the fun right uh well you have to
01:35 - understand when you're when you're
01:36 - taking on uh you know a career change or
01:38 - a
01:39 - life change
01:40 - your your life and career are changing
01:42 - and you need to reflect that so um for
01:45 - me i personally sold all my game systems
01:47 - like i always had an issue where i
01:48 - couldn't
01:49 - i say couldn't i didn't have the
01:51 - self-control to have a game console in
01:54 - the house
01:55 - and not play it when i should be coding
01:57 - when i should be going to a meetup when
01:59 - i should be reading um
02:01 - a book about software
02:03 - so that's the first things and that's
02:04 - more than just you know physical items
02:07 - in the house uh if you watch a ton of tv
02:09 - sell your tv
02:11 - uh sell your game systems um surround
02:14 - yourself with like-minded individuals as
02:15 - well right so one thing that i had to do
02:18 - was i had to stop hanging out with my
02:19 - friends who were you know losers
02:21 - essentially and uh losers in the sense
02:23 - that
02:24 - they you know they just want to go out
02:26 - drink every night and you know they were
02:28 - okay going and working their you know
02:30 - minimum wage job in the morning and
02:32 - that's if that's what you want to do but
02:34 - to me that's not those aren't the people
02:36 - are going to help me become a better
02:38 - developer
02:39 - so surround yourself with people who are
02:41 - trying to who are developers are trying
02:43 - to be better developers and slowly those
02:45 - distractions whether they be friends
02:48 - whether they be game consoles in my case
02:51 - uh will slowly
02:53 - weave them out because you're going to
02:54 - be changing as a person but you can in
02:57 - the in the short term you can get rid of
02:58 - the stuff that you don't need uh that
03:00 - are just items relatively quickly
03:03 - number two is um pretty much setting a
03:05 - schedule
03:07 - setting a schedule um the uh the the
03:10 - thing here is
03:12 - it is very easy to say that you are
03:13 - going to
03:15 - you know work hard every day but what
03:17 - does that mean what does that really
03:18 - mean and when you have a schedule you
03:21 - are forcing yourself into a situation
03:23 - where
03:24 - no matter what from the hours of 7 a.m
03:26 - to 8 a.m i'm going to be doing an hour
03:28 - of something from the hours of you know
03:31 - 7 p.m to 9 00 p.m every night i give
03:33 - those examples because those are the
03:34 - hours that i work um on my youtube
03:37 - channel on my courses
03:39 - on becoming a better developer
03:41 - in the same hours that i worked when i
03:43 - was learning to code before i was a
03:45 - developer because you know most of us
03:47 - probably aren't self-employed probably
03:50 - aren't uh independently wealthy so we
03:52 - have to find the time and
03:54 - when you find the time you know so far
03:56 - we've eliminated the distractions which
03:58 - in theory should create the time so that
04:00 - we can stick to our schedule
04:02 - and
04:03 - it's hard to do but it is one of the
04:07 - ways to stick with being consistent to
04:09 - consistently work hard and
04:12 - you'll continue to make progress if you
04:14 - do that
04:15 - now tip number three is having clearly
04:18 - defined milestones now what does that
04:20 - really mean
04:22 - in reality what we're really talking
04:23 - about is having goals and knowing when
04:25 - you have accomplished those goals it's
04:28 - very easy to
04:29 - have one goal right i want to be a
04:32 - developer dylan that's my one and only
04:34 - goal okay well what are the goals you
04:36 - need to achieve to accomplish that goal
04:38 - right
04:39 - goal number one
04:41 - set up a github right all right cool i
04:43 - set up a github i have a new project
04:45 - cool a little baby milestone first
04:47 - project on github awesome you have a
04:49 - linkedin cool you've worked on your
04:50 - linkedin you've got it out there oh
04:52 - you've built your personal portfolio
04:53 - site in react in angular whatever it is
04:55 - if you're a frontend dev back in dev but
04:57 - you built some project all these little
04:59 - goals and milestones understand what it
05:01 - is that you want to accomplish if your
05:03 - end goal is to become a front-end
05:05 - developer you need to have
05:07 - 10
05:08 - mini goals on your path to getting there
05:11 - that include all the languages you need
05:13 - to be familiar with the framework that
05:14 - you want to learn the projects that
05:15 - you're building in that framework
05:17 - etc etc etc not only will
05:20 - it give you a better idea and a learning
05:22 - path that you need to have a lot of
05:24 - times it gets very overwhelming
05:26 - especially in the the web dev world
05:28 - because there's new stuff coming out oh
05:30 - should i learn view should you know
05:31 - python django what what what should i
05:34 - learn
05:35 - you can do your own research on that but
05:37 - what you need to do is after you've done
05:39 - your research after you've talked with
05:41 - your mentor after you've you know
05:42 - watched videos read blogs
05:45 - you need to define that path on how to
05:48 - get to your end goal and those many
05:50 - milestones you get there not only will
05:52 - it keep you motivated because you'll see
05:55 - like oh i'm getting closer because
05:57 - you're either going zero to a hundred if
05:58 - your only goal here is to be a dev
06:01 - you're going to feel like you're at zero
06:02 - until you're a hundred and that's very
06:03 - demotivating so you need to have those
06:05 - clearly
06:06 - clearly defined goals and also give you
06:08 - the confidence for when you are ready to
06:10 - start throwing out those job
06:12 - applications when you are ready to start
06:14 - saying you know what
06:16 - i'm ready let's go interview right let's
06:18 - go start submitting those resumes let's
06:20 - start doing those technical interviews
06:22 - those those phone screens
06:24 - so those clearly defined goals are going
06:25 - to be what allow you to stay motivated
06:28 - and it's a little it's nice all right
06:29 - i'm you know i'm one step closer so
06:31 - that's something that i think is a big
06:33 - deal that you need to have set up in in
06:34 - your learning path to stay consistent
06:37 - all right this may come as a little bit
06:39 - of a uh like well didn't you just say
06:41 - you need to get rid of those distracting
06:43 - friends well yes
06:44 - but you need to expose your process to
06:48 - other people
06:49 - so that they're on the same page and
06:51 - that doesn't mean that i'm telling you
06:52 - to kick out your mother kick out your
06:54 - brother from your life or anything like
06:55 - that or your kids because you know they
06:57 - take up your time and energy to a degree
07:00 - but for those people who you're like you
07:03 - know they're not a negative in influence
07:05 - on me but they do they are time right if
07:08 - you have kids you need to watch them you
07:09 - know your husband or your wife you know
07:11 - while you're out learning that's taking
07:13 - energy away from the family and so
07:15 - everyone needs to be on the same page
07:16 - right
07:17 - one thing that i did
07:19 - when i was living with my mother and i
07:21 - was coding is i had a sign and i
07:24 - basically did the pomodoro technique for
07:26 - except i did about hours so if you're
07:27 - not familiar with pomodoro technique you
07:29 - work then you take a break for a certain
07:30 - amount so typically people do about 30
07:32 - minutes and then they take a 10 minute
07:34 - break so uh what i did was i worked for
07:36 - about an hour and my mother loved her
07:39 - death she'd always be knocking on the
07:40 - door hey you want anything to eat you
07:41 - know hey can you help me move the couch
07:44 - all this sort of stuff not that she's
07:45 - trying to bother me but this is you know
07:47 - when you are coding you need to get into
07:49 - a groove right you need to
07:52 - you need to be able to
07:54 - sit down
07:55 - and 50 it might take you 15 20 minutes
07:57 - to ramp up and then you get 40 minutes
07:59 - productivity in an hour everyone's
08:00 - different but um if you let the people
08:03 - in your life know that okay well you
08:04 - know
08:05 - you let your children know if daddy has
08:07 - this sign on the door says um you know
08:09 - busy learning or whatever it is don't
08:11 - come in you know go ask mommy and then
08:13 - you have 40 minutes and you just have
08:15 - people respect that and then in my case
08:17 - i would put on the door and i come out
08:18 - and say hey mom is there anything you
08:19 - need you know april anything i can help
08:21 - you with whatever it may be and reach
08:24 - out to them but it is important that
08:25 - people understand because they they may
08:27 - not right uh my mother to this day still
08:29 - thinks i'm just in there playing video
08:31 - games right she thinks i'm just in there
08:33 - playing starcraft um
08:35 - uh you know that's what she's so but she
08:37 - did respect the fact that i you know set
08:40 - some boundaries to a degree and and said
08:42 - hey you know what i'm i'm i'm just
08:45 - trying to learn here i'm trying to
08:46 - better myself and to do that i need i
08:49 - need to be able to focus i need the time
08:52 - that it is required to accomplish that
08:55 - and when you when you've set those those
08:57 - boundaries other people are on the same
08:59 - page and then you you also feel a sense
09:01 - of pride because now people know what
09:03 - you're trying to accomplish and now it's
09:05 - like oh well i don't want to let moms
09:07 - down i don't want to let the girlfriend
09:08 - down whatever maybe the husband down um
09:11 - so i i encourage you to explain your
09:13 - process and get people to be on the same
09:16 - page as you
09:18 - last but not least is a little bit more
09:19 - of a
09:20 - flexible be flexible with yourself um a
09:23 - lot of what was talking about scheduling
09:26 - having organized goals
09:28 - um being able to to inform people of you
09:31 - know how can they work within your
09:34 - system so that everyone's on the same
09:35 - page you get the time you need but being
09:37 - flexible with yourself is probably the
09:39 - number one thing that you
09:41 - need to understand to a degree right
09:44 - what do i mean by being flexible with
09:45 - yourself well
09:47 - if you're trying to learn to code or
09:49 - even you're a developer you're just
09:50 - trying to get better and you're saying
09:52 - look man i'm already a developer i want
09:53 - to go from junior to senior and i want
09:55 - to do it in a year
09:56 - i want to build i want to write a book i
09:57 - want to build a course whatever it is um
10:00 - there's going to be days where you don't
10:01 - want to do it there's going to be days
10:03 - where you're tired um you know you just
10:06 - got off work your boss just verbally
10:09 - abused you right whatever it is um you
10:12 - know your boyfriend dumped you your
10:13 - girlfriend
10:14 - uh is cheating on you whatever it may be
10:17 - right there's going to be days where
10:18 - you're just in a
10:20 - awful place
10:21 - could nothing could happen you're just
10:23 - tired you're not bored um you're stuck
10:25 - on something and for those days it's
10:27 - okay take a break no but it is okay
10:31 - to
10:32 - change your attitude and change
10:35 - how you're going to refocus yourself so
10:37 - if you've been hacking away on a project
10:39 - and you've just hit
10:40 - something and you're you're at a wall
10:42 - how can you continue your learning path
10:44 - how can you continue to be consistent
10:46 - within your schedule well you can um you
10:48 - can read some blogs for instance learn
10:50 - about stuff you can watch you know a
10:51 - two-hour talk on es6 es7 whatever it is
10:54 - whatever you're interested in
10:57 - you can go to hackathons you can go to
10:58 - meetups have all this sort of stuff
11:00 - where
11:01 - you know go hang out with a friend who
11:04 - hopefully is a developer and you know do
11:06 - some pair programming
11:08 - do some just change it up is what i'm
11:10 - trying to say for those days that you're
11:12 - like
11:13 - god man i just i'm tired like i love
11:15 - this i love this but i'm so tired today
11:19 - and i don't want to do it well
11:22 - do something else that's still going to
11:23 - help you accomplish those milestones
11:25 - it's going to make you a better
11:26 - developer and make you stay on the path
11:29 - right because
11:30 - the thing is is every time every day
11:32 - even if it feels like the tiniest of
11:34 - steps your that consistency is moving
11:36 - you one step closer to your goal a one
11:39 - step closer to the milestone you know
11:41 - each one of these milestones are like a
11:42 - gas station we're just filling up again
11:44 - before you get to your final destination
11:47 - and that consistency through all of it
11:48 - is really what you're going to need to
11:50 - succeed in any aspect of your software
11:52 - career and i highly encourage you to try
11:54 - and keep it fun keep it fresh and keep
11:56 - it consistent because consistency will
11:58 - be what takes you to the next level of
12:00 - your career wherever they may be but uh
12:03 - anyhow guys that's my five tips on how
12:04 - to be consistent how to work hard
12:06 - essentially and stay on the path uh
12:08 - whatever your path may be so i hope you
12:10 - found it helpful thank you for watching
12:12 - the video and check out my channel
