00:08 - hey everybody its Jesse and I hope
00:14 - everyone had a good weekend
00:17 - today I'm streaming a little bit earlier
00:20 - than normal to an hour earlier because
00:23 - the Eclipse is today and so around like
00:29 - 2:30 I think there's going to be a
00:31 - partial eclipse where I am so I guess
00:38 - like if I would have drove maybe five or
00:41 - six hours south west of where I am I
00:45 - could have seen a full Eclipse I thought
00:47 - about it but I didn't decided not to do
00:52 - it so today I think we're just gonna
01:01 - work on styling so this is this is where
01:05 - the projects at right now basically all
01:09 - of the content that was that's on the
01:13 - current app is here it's it's in our new
01:19 - react version so we have that all in
01:23 - there we have the the forms we have two
01:28 - forms one of the form is is working we
01:35 - just I don't have all the information to
01:37 - finish that form yet we have another
01:41 - form that we just we hadn't hooked up
01:44 - yet in our our server to be able to send
01:47 - the data where we needed to go that's
01:50 - not really going to be a big deal since
01:52 - we've already done it with one form we
01:53 - just do it again for the other one yes
01:59 - there's just not there's not really any
02:01 - major things left to do it's just kind
02:03 - of fine-tuning and testing and then
02:05 - getting feedback from the rest of my
02:08 - department and new content from the rest
02:11 - of my department because I think
02:12 - I've talked to a few people about it and
02:15 - I think that we're gonna add some
02:17 - sections and change the language in some
02:20 - of the sections so I obviously can't do
02:23 - that and so I know for sure what content
02:26 - is needed so I'm gonna do my best to get
02:32 - that going and make sure to remind
02:34 - everyone to think about what they want
02:37 - on here and get something to me you know
02:42 - sooner rather than later so I was
02:48 - thinking I'd start out maybe on the
02:52 - homepage and making things look a little
02:56 - bit nicer so this is gonna be a good
02:58 - stream for newer people maybe people who
03:00 - are just starting out because it's going
03:03 - to be more like CSS not not really a lot
03:10 - of you know we're not really gonna work
03:12 - on the server not really a lot of things
03:16 - that are getting like really into react
03:21 - and it'll be a somewhat short stream I
03:24 - want to get things done I guess within
03:29 - an hour so let me see
03:34 - actually let me know let me know if
03:37 - everything's all right with the stream
03:38 - we have a lot fewer of yours than normal
03:43 - so that's kind of odd I wonder the last
03:48 - time this happened something something
03:51 - happened with the YouTube notifications
03:53 - and a lot of people didn't get them so I
03:55 - know there's a delay so I'll wait I'll
03:57 - wait uh maybe 30 seconds to see if
04:00 - anybody responds I want to make sure I'm
04:05 - not didn't do something wrong setting up
04:08 - the video
04:28 - okay cool y-yes I got a response
04:31 - everything seems alright okay it's
04:34 - possible that maybe it wasn't something
04:37 - wrong with the YouTube notifications
04:38 - again but I'm just I'm gonna get started
04:41 - and if people join great if not that's
04:48 - not a problem either I got to do my work
04:50 - either way so let me let me see I'm kind
05:01 - of thinking it might be nice to add in
05:05 - so we have a new logo that's not being
05:07 - used in very many places right now it
05:11 - would probably be nice to put it here so
05:14 - that everybody would see what with the
05:17 - new web logo is you know eventually
05:19 - that's going to be used on all the sites
05:22 - also I'd like to try changing this a bit
05:27 - because we're going with a different
05:28 - look in some of our projects so I'm
05:33 - gonna work on this for now probably need
05:38 - we talked about before doing something
05:41 - here
05:43 - to make these look a bit nicer as well
05:45 - oh I do want to thank thank Matt for his
05:54 - pull request so a lot of good stuff in
05:57 - the pull request you can check it out it
05:59 - was poor request 80 or 48 there's just
06:04 - so much stuff I could spend like half
06:06 - hour going over all the stuff so I'm not
06:08 - going to but basically fix them some
06:12 - like little errors that were happening
06:13 - and also made a lot of components into
06:18 - stateless functional components any
06:22 - components that could be made into them
06:24 - so really really cool and I really
06:31 - appreciate it I mean it was it was a lot
06:33 - of work all of our content
06:35 - I could probably the biggest thing that
06:37 - you'll notice if you're working on this
06:38 - on this repo is that
06:42 - almost all of the content now is in data
06:45 - in these data files and is pulled in so
06:47 - the components themselves look a lot
06:50 - cleaner a breakpoint said Eclipse cast
06:57 - the question mark yeah I thought about
07:00 - trying to do something I had on maybe I
07:07 - could do one on my my Instagram stream
07:10 - stream with the Eclipse Eclipse it looks
07:13 - like that might be cool I don't have any
07:20 - of those special glasses though that
07:22 - they say you need or else you'll damage
07:23 - your eyes so hopefully I'll figure
07:26 - something out and I won't go blind
07:40 - all right so I'm gonna bring over dev
07:43 - tools we're going to be working mostly
07:46 - in dev tools and then once we get it you
07:49 - know looking about how we want it then
07:52 - I'll I'll switch over and put that in an
07:57 - actual sass file so let's take a look at
08:04 - all right structure here so right now we
08:09 - have the background color is green I
08:10 - want to change that and let's make it
08:13 - white and I wanted to set a order bottom
08:22 - and I'm gonna do let's see I'm gonna try
08:27 - three pixels solid and I want it to be a
08:33 - gold I'm gonna have to I thought I had
08:40 - the style guide open somewhere so I
08:44 - could grab that color I used to have
08:47 - some of the hex colors memorized for the
08:50 - university color palette because I use
08:52 - them so much but then when I started
08:54 - using sass variables instead I didn't
08:57 - have to know the hex colors and I forgot
08:58 - them all I do remember the green still
09:03 - but I forgot all the rest of them
09:06 - alright so on my other screen I'm just
09:08 - gonna find this hex code and copy it
09:12 - over
09:18 - oops
09:23 - up those the wrong one I got the yellow
09:27 - you need the gold
09:37 - area
09:41 - okay
09:46 - yeah that looks about like what we were
09:49 - going with we need to make this green
10:15 - why don't I even have the color here
10:20 - that's
10:26 - that was odd I wonder if I did I put
10:28 - that color in or was that there in the
10:30 - framework because anyway normally in an
10:33 - SVG you don't have to worry about color
10:35 - it's fill that you want so I don't I
10:39 - don't really remember if if I put that
10:43 - on there before it's possible but I did
10:45 - accidentally okay now we have the words
10:54 - Resource Center which I guess that will
10:58 - get left that yeah that'll get left and
11:04 - I think I'll leave the words Resource
11:06 - Center in and let's also make that this
11:09 - green
11:17 - alright now we want to grab the the logo
11:21 - which let me find the logo also let me
11:26 - start my Pomodoro timer it's I don't
11:34 - think I've actually used this logo
11:35 - anywhere yet so I have to take a second
11:39 - to find it maybe I think I actually I
11:51 - had an SVG version of it that I was
11:54 - working on and sketch yes it is so you
12:08 - can check it out here's the logo
12:10 - this is actually my edited version of
12:12 - the logo so it had a much bigger border
12:15 - radius that I didn't like
12:16 - so I Shrunk the border radius under two
12:21 - pixels and yet so we'll see so I I was
12:27 - trying to get officially get the border
12:30 - radius changed and it never really I
12:34 - didn't really push it and we didn't come
12:36 - to a decision about it so I think I'm
12:39 - gonna use this one and just see what see
12:43 - what everyone thinks if anyone even
12:45 - notices and yeah I mean I may have to
12:49 - change it or this may be the beginning
12:52 - of getting it changed it's still at a
12:55 - point now where we haven't used this
12:57 - logo enough that you know we need to
13:00 - keep it consistent it's definitely early
13:02 - on so we could change things at least I
13:06 - think we could change things before it's
13:09 - official but anyway yeah this is the new
13:14 - the new web version of the logo the main
13:19 - benefit to this as opposed to the other
13:22 - one is all our other logos actually
13:23 - spelled out the words Franciscan
13:25 - University of Steubenville and to do
13:28 - that you have to
13:29 - small font so the logo had to be quite
13:32 - large to make the font readable so then
13:36 - you were you were limited and with where
13:39 - you could put the logo it had to be in a
13:41 - spot that was big enough so like we
13:45 - could never use the real logo in a
13:48 - header that was this short because you
13:54 - wouldn't be able to read the text so
13:56 - it's definitely some benefits to this
13:58 - and really for this university probably
14:03 - the iconic thing is this here
14:07 - people know this so as long as that's
14:11 - there you know it doesn't necessarily
14:14 - matter as much about whatever's after
14:18 - that you know people who know the
14:20 - university will recognize that let's see
14:31 - so I'm gonna grab I don't know where I
14:36 - saved this that I'll just export it
14:40 - again if you're not familiar with this
14:42 - program and I'm using it's called sketch
14:45 - it's it's like a design program so I
14:50 - don't I'm not really great with
14:52 - Photoshop so this is what I use for the
14:57 - small amount of design work like this
14:59 - that I do occasionally if I have a
15:02 - client and I need to do some mock-ups I
15:04 - will use cap sketch for that it's Mac
15:10 - only and it's not bad I think it was
15:14 - about a hundred dollars and that's
15:15 - that's not a like recurring cost just
15:18 - hundred always flat fee and then you
15:20 - have sketch you have all the updates and
15:21 - everything so I like it although I
15:26 - haven't really tried a lot of other
15:27 - programs so maybe there's something
15:29 - better out there but this is as worked
15:31 - for me for what I need to use it and
15:34 - obviously there we go export so I don't
15:38 - use this often enough to be really good
15:41 - with it
15:42 - SVG yep great
15:54 - it looks like I already have it exported
15:57 - where is this folder
16:07 - I will just search for it then
16:40 - all right whoa
16:46 - all right so this is the the code I
16:50 - guess for the the mark-up for the SVG
16:54 - you see I've done nothing to to shrink
17:01 - this down so I'm sure there's stuff that
17:03 - could be done for now I just want to see
17:06 - how it looks so we're gonna use this
17:10 - let's so we'll just bring this in do we
17:22 - have I don't know that we have a place
17:27 - where we're putting images do we know we
17:33 - don't okay so let me make a folder for
17:36 - images
18:33 - actually I'm just gonna make a new file
18:52 - okay set in there we go
19:05 - see
19:25 - I can't remember where I have what
19:27 - component I have the code for the Navin
19:43 - is it inside now
19:49 - all right it's it it's inside Navi is a
19:53 - slightly misleading maybe I shouldn't
19:55 - have named it that okay alright so I am
20:01 - using the component for material UI so
20:03 - I'm assuming that there's a way to put a
20:07 - logo in
21:14 - maybe
21:21 - maybe this will work let's see
22:16 - alright let's see what that does not not
22:21 - hopeful that that will work oh no we
22:25 - lost all our styles I never I forgot to
22:27 - take him out of dev tools oh well we
22:32 - didn't really do that much so won't
22:33 - really be a problem but whatever I just
22:38 - did here didn't do anything so let's
22:42 - let's put in some styles for this before
22:45 - we before we do anything else
23:05 - there we go and I'm gonna put the styles
23:08 - for this and app because this is a
23:11 - standard component it'll be on every
23:13 - single page I guess I could make
23:20 - something for side nav but I think this
23:22 - is OK
23:26 - alright so I just need to know what
23:28 - these the names are here
23:50 - it looks like it's not there's no class
23:54 - names on it so maybe I'll have to author
23:59 - you either give it a class name or I
24:04 - think I'll give it a class name I'm sure
24:06 - I could pass in some styles using you
24:12 - know the way set out here in material UI
24:15 - but I'd rather work in sass and apply
24:19 - the Styles like that okay yeah so that's
24:27 - pretty standard class name works most of
24:31 - the time the only time class name hasn't
24:34 - worked for me is if like I've kind of
24:37 - extended a component like in that
24:39 - generic component card I can't just put
24:42 - a class name right on the generic
24:43 - component element and have it work
24:59 - okay we're just gonna give a class name
25:01 - of app bar and then we should be able to
25:03 - go with a poor background color white
25:18 - water bottom solid
25:25 - let me grab that color
25:41 - and what else to be
25:47 - let's just make sure that works first
25:52 - okay we did get the border on the bottom
25:56 - but maybe for some reason you know what
26:06 - these are all uh I don't know I didn't
26:09 - see this before these are all in line so
26:12 - to override this I'm either gonna have
26:16 - to use important or I'll have to change
26:19 - change these let me go back here
26:33 - okay I can override with the style yeah
26:41 - I'll probably I guess that's better than
26:47 - using important in my CSS
27:12 - okay that works
27:56 - and what I'm not sure about is so these
28:01 - interior sections here also have inline
28:06 - styles so I could try to do something
28:11 - like this but I don't think it'll work
28:28 - see it doesn't go down to this so I'm
28:33 - not
28:41 - so I may have to just use important on
28:48 - there to get that to work
28:50 - so since I'm using sass instead of
28:53 - regular CSS I can nest
28:56 - I can nest these which is basically same
28:59 - as if I were to type out a bar and then
29:02 - space h1 so if you're not familiar with
29:07 - sass the syntax probably looks a little
29:09 - weird but that's all that's going on
29:11 - here
29:26 - I'm just gonna double check just to make
29:28 - sure I yeah like I thought it wouldn't
29:33 - need add that important in there
29:40 - all right so normally it's not a great
29:43 - idea to use important because now at any
29:46 - point that guy I can't really override
29:49 - that even with inline Styles so like
29:55 - once you do that you kind of break the
29:57 - cascading nature of cascading style
30:01 - sheets for that element at least but in
30:08 - this case I could do this right now and
30:13 - get it to work and I know I'm never
30:15 - gonna want this to change for that
30:16 - element so I'm okay with that or I could
30:19 - try to read documentation on material UI
30:21 - more and figure out some other way to do
30:24 - it
30:25 - so it's possible later on if I maybe
30:29 - I'll figure it out and I can change this
30:30 - but for now this is the easiest way to
30:33 - do it and I know it will work but like I
30:36 - said you don't want to just use this all
30:38 - the time sometimes it's really easy and
30:41 - quick to do it but it will make
30:43 - maintaining things later on harder so
30:46 - use it sparingly
30:47 - I guess that's that's what I try to use
30:49 - it sparingly I probably use it too much
30:52 - as it is the alright so what it looks
30:59 - like we messed up I'm assuming when I
31:01 - did this that's why when I messed up the
31:07 - icon there yeah so now we can see let's
31:13 - target that SVG
31:19 - and we want that the fill you want the
31:23 - fill also to be oops
31:32 - I know I'm typing up the hex codes here
31:34 - I don't really need to I could save him
31:37 - his variables but I just kind of wanted
31:40 - to see how it was going oh did that now
31:46 - that didn't work
31:50 - oops forgot the important
31:58 - there we go still alright so that's
32:04 - about where we were before I
32:06 - accidentally I got rid of all the stuff
32:10 - we've done in dev tools so now the next
32:13 - step let me check my Pomodoro timer okay
32:21 - next step is get that logo in there and
32:26 - for that maybe I'll check this again
32:41 - actually let me
32:56 - okay I never really checked to see what
33:00 - was happening with this so I want to
33:02 - check because it's possible that this I
33:03 - guess put this element in there and the
33:06 - path is just wrong
33:07 - I'm not really sure what path I should
33:10 - use for this I knew with next J asked
33:14 - what the path was supposed to be but I'm
33:16 - not really sure what it's supposed to be
33:17 - with create react app so let's check
33:24 - that out and it looks like Oh awesome so
33:34 - we did get it is there I mean we don't I
33:37 - want to find some other way to put it in
33:40 - here because I need that button as well
33:42 - but this is what we wanted I think we
33:53 - just probably don't have the right path
34:09 - hmm
34:33 - okay let's see
34:43 - let me see I'm gonna check in the live
34:45 - chat see if anybody the users create
34:49 - react app knows what so if anybody uses
34:53 - create react app and just knows offhand
34:55 - what the pass should be let me know
34:56 - otherwise I'm just gonna play around
34:59 - with it a little bit and see if I could
35:04 - figure it out let me see
35:35 - just
36:56 - okay my timer just went off so I did
36:58 - find something to try for the the image
37:03 - but I'm going to take five minute break
37:04 - to go to the live chat probably won't
37:07 - need all five minutes because there's
37:08 - not a lot going on in the live chat
37:10 - today but hey everybody
37:13 - that's that's watching and it's in the
37:15 - chat
37:19 - no cool Patrick Patrick has some
37:26 - eclipses info in the live chat
37:36 - oh cool so I mentioned earlier that I
37:40 - don't have Eclipse glasses and Patrick
37:43 - linked some directions to making a an
37:48 - eclipse if you were so thank you I said
37:58 - you just need two pieces of paper and a
38:00 - thumbtack detect to make a pinhole cool
38:03 - oh sorry so patrick said sketch went to
38:07 - a yearly fee I did not know that so I'm
38:10 - sorry for misinforming you all so I
38:15 - guess whenever I got it
38:17 - there was not a yearly fee so maybe
38:19 - maybe I'm just allowed to have it still
38:22 - since I got in earlier
38:23 - oh cool patch you know what Patrick
38:31 - that's right I you're in Tennessee right
38:33 - so you're right in the path I was I was
38:36 - thinking about going driving down to
38:38 - Tennessee or flying down to Tennessee so
38:40 - my wife has family there and I thought
38:43 - that would be really cool I could go
38:45 - down there I could just you know stay
38:46 - with her family and see the Eclipse but
38:50 - it seemed like I don't know it's it's
38:54 - seemed like it would be no other thing
38:55 - to do to take a day off work and just to
38:59 - go down and Washington cliffs for a few
39:02 - minutes come back
39:18 - oh cool Gavin said I should take well or
39:23 - probably Patrick will have the better
39:24 - view
39:25 - so Patrick should Gavin said take some
39:29 - pics and vids and send them to slag so
39:31 - if I'll try to I'll definitely try take
39:34 - some video and pictures of it but
39:35 - Patrick's gonna have the best the best
39:39 - view out of anyone so I think where I'm
39:43 - at they said it was going to be like 80%
39:46 - obscured oh so the Sun will be 80%
39:49 - obscured by the moon which I guess is
39:51 - not bad but it's definitely not a fool
39:53 - full of cliffs
40:04 - okay so patrick said he doesn't have a
40:06 - solar filter for the camera so so you
40:09 - need a filter then if if I tried to take
40:13 - a video of this with my phone am I going
40:16 - to break my phone's camera or what
40:28 - our cool Gavin said he's totally up to
40:31 - date with the videos that's awesome
40:32 - that's that's a really impressive who's
40:34 - with quite a few videos it's really cool
41:09 - oh wow so Brandon thanks for that info
41:12 - so Brandon says not to take pictures and
41:16 - videos because I I will break the phone
41:25 - all rohan says the phone camera should
41:28 - be okay without without filters says
41:32 - it's the larger sensors that can be
41:34 - damaged but patrick says that actually
41:40 - we saw a video where the sensor on a
41:46 - camera got melted yeah we'll see maybe
41:54 - I'll rethink this
42:08 - okay cool so my my time is up so I'm
42:16 - gonna get back to work on this so I'm
42:19 - gonna try something and this is I don't
42:21 - think I've ever done anything this way
42:24 - before but it looks pretty cool so let
42:28 - me try this so I'm going to I mean it
42:36 - makes a lot of sense now that I saw it
42:38 - but I just had not thought of it at all
42:40 - so I'm going to import logo from
43:02 - shoot now how am i darkness
43:14 - here we go
43:32 - now I'm not sure if this will work say I
43:34 - didn't scroll down and the there's an
43:37 - issue and create reactive about this
43:41 - so after scrolling down I'm not sure if
43:43 - this will work but let's let's try it
43:49 - and see if I can import since what are
43:53 - there to be liked
44:09 - whereas
44:41 - we can get this to it no cure so uh
44:46 - alright so I need to do this
45:31 - I just look back to the live chat and
45:33 - I'll just mention this since we were
45:35 - talking about it a minute ago
45:36 - but breakpoint said I took pics with my
45:47 - phone of the Sun no issues
45:50 - now Brandon Brandon says I'm a
45:53 - photographer don't risk it actually the
45:55 - guy that works in the office next to me
45:57 - is a photographer a really good
46:00 - photographer so I will ask him just to
46:03 - be sure he actually has like proper
46:06 - lenses or something for it so actually
46:11 - if he takes good pictures I will have
46:13 - him send me the pictures and then I will
46:15 - post the pictures I won't try to mess up
46:19 - my my phone I'd rather not I bought I
46:24 - bought like the new pixel when it came
46:27 - out and that's like the most I've ever
46:30 - spent on a phone so I wanted to last
46:33 - longer than a year at least that's it
46:35 - hasn't been a year yet alright so back
46:44 - to this why can't I I have to be missing
46:49 - something just really simple there's
46:51 - this just can't be this can't be that
46:54 - difficult
47:24 - alright somebody said they did it like
47:26 - this and on stackoverflow it works
48:01 - all right still not
49:34 - alright let's try the documentation for
49:41 - create react app which is what I should
49:43 - have looked first
50:10 - all right so from what I'm seeing on the
50:15 - documentation it looks like this should
50:17 - work right so
50:37 - okay I can't do with sgv SVG for
50:41 - house
50:56 - so let's see what to do with SVG
52:44 - actually I have an idea let's do it like
52:47 - this I'm gonna make
53:39 - it's
53:51 - you're gonna grab just some of this
53:53 - markup to make things easier and so my
54:00 - idea is I'm just going to put this SVG
54:03 - in here
54:14 - yeah so I'm gonna grab the SVG I'm gonna
54:21 - take this out of here
54:25 - so I'm think I need that
54:44 - probably gonna have to change something
54:46 - somewhere I'll be surprised if all of
54:49 - these attributes work and react but
54:52 - we'll see what the error message says we
54:55 - can get rid of this and then let's just
54:59 - change this to
55:12 - and let's see you know how we can bring
55:17 - in and for it
55:30 - oops isn't that what I wanted to do
55:39 - click the wrong thing there we go side
55:42 - now that's I wanted
55:59 - just go go and then here we're gonna put
56:13 - let's try that okay cool let's get rid
56:19 - of just get rid of this
56:35 - I took it out okay
57:00 - oops Rapha
57:17 - this is a function
57:25 - hmm
57:32 - it's just
57:39 - all right so I'm gonna I'm not sure what
57:43 - this error is telling me I'm maybe you
57:48 - can't just put an SVG in like that let
57:56 - me get rid of some stuff
58:16 - see
58:48 - mm yeah I still get the same error okay
59:02 - I definitely did not think adding the
59:08 - logo would be this difficult
59:15 - I've added SVG's and but they view in
59:21 - small SVG so not really complicated so
59:25 - I'm not sure I mean I guess there's
59:31 - something in here that react is not like
59:34 - oh why am i checking that it's giving me
59:42 - the same error here okay
59:43 - I was checking the wrong page okay
60:02 - hey Sebastian Sebastian is asking where
60:05 - I'm adding the logo so I'm trying to add
60:08 - the logo in maybe that's let's let's
60:15 - just test this first without trying to
60:17 - pass this to another component just take
60:24 - this
60:35 - let's just shut he uses somewhere else
61:37 - oops no it's not the right path for this
61:39 - one huh
62:18 - okay so still having the same same issue
62:43 - all right so that's that's not gonna
62:45 - work out there I guess I could not use
62:49 - the SVG version and just convert it I'd
62:55 - really rather not do that
63:07 - didn't
63:44 - I wonder if I could wrap this in this
63:50 - SVG icon if that would make a difference
65:01 - all right so this will probably be my
65:04 - last attempt since I had a a to finish
65:07 - this this stream soon I guess
65:30 - yeah same thing alright well I will try
65:38 - to missing and wait the SVG name is
65:47 - wrong all right so I just checked
66:07 - I knew I just checked the live chat and
66:10 - I think I'm missing a nose somewhere FUS
66:14 - log all right let me where am I missing
66:18 - this
66:37 - if you say
66:48 - oh that's where I'm missing it huh Wow
66:55 - okay if this works now
67:01 - all right let's let's take it out of
67:06 - here
67:11 - and let's go with what I was originally
67:17 - gonna do that would be
67:37 - it's not gonna import that here but I'm
67:42 - gonna try
68:29 - I see their worries oops that's not kind
68:36 - of
68:48 - ha
68:50 - and okay wow I can't believe well you
69:00 - know what it probably still wouldn't
69:03 - worked even a photo caught the type
69:04 - because this this I did not have either
69:07 - this required so thanks Matt for giving
69:12 - me the code to do this require in line
69:14 - like that and thank you also Joseph for
69:17 - catching that missing oh I don't know
69:19 - how you saw that this must be so tiny on
69:23 - your screen and actually I just now
69:26 - realized that the font was a bit smaller
69:29 - than I normally do for a stream so I
69:31 - apologize for that
69:33 - Wow okay we get the logo on there a lot
69:38 - bigger than I want but we can sort that
69:40 - out at a different time also we need to
69:44 - keep the side nav icon in there as well
69:49 - so got a little bit of a work to do for
69:52 - this but Wow
69:56 - I can't believe it took me that long and
69:58 - it was pretty much just mostly due to a
70:02 - typo
70:03 - oh cool just zoomed awesome okay Joseph
70:11 - said the import on the top will also
70:13 - work so that's cool good to know so
70:16 - maybe it it probably then would have
70:18 - worked had I been able to spell anyway
70:27 - thanks everybody I'm gonna wrap things
70:30 - up and and get ready to watch this
70:33 - Eclipse so hopefully I'll have my vision
70:37 - and I won't ruin my my phone's camera so
70:42 - I think I'll I don't I don't know how
70:48 - I'm gonna look at it maybe I'm not I'm
70:50 - just gonna look around and not at the
70:53 - Eclipse but but hopefully my my
70:57 - colleague will have some really good
70:59 - photos from his camera
71:02 - and I can share them with you all on the
71:04 - select channel so I'll be back tomorrow
71:07 - and hopefully tomorrow won't have such a
71:14 - silly error as a typo but that happens
71:21 - yeah so I'll probably do some work this
71:24 - hopefully this will look a lot nicer by
71:27 - the next stream and thank you for
71:31 - watching
71:32 - also let me know if something went wrong
71:36 - with the YouTube notifications because
71:38 - it was kind of the video was kind of
71:41 - slow to pick up viewers so I know I did
71:43 - start it early so that could be it but I
71:47 - just want to know maybe I did something
71:50 - wrong setting up the YouTube video so
