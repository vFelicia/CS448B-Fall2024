08:16 - post we will see this post called I am
08:19 - we can edit this and we can delete this
08:23 - so
08:24 - this likes that we have here
08:26 - it's it's based on
08:28 - single user single post like
08:31 - which means if you like a post from one
08:34 - user that won't be afflected in the
08:36 - another user so that's a good thing
08:39 - let me delete the post here and we will
08:42 - see post has been deleted
08:44 - fine so that was all for the lending
08:47 - clone and now let's see how to build
08:49 - this using reactant Firebase
08:55 - so the first step to do that is to
08:57 - create a reactive
08:59 - and we will use wheat the sweet build
09:02 - tool
09:03 - so we can copy the command to create a
09:06 - direct tab and then we can have
09:09 - LinkedIn clone enter choose react
09:14 - JavaScript
09:16 - and it's created now we have to go to
09:19 - file
09:20 - and open folder and go to that folder
09:22 - which is LinkedIn for LinkedIn clone
09:26 - yes
09:27 - fine so we have the packages here inside
09:30 - packages and as you see let me just make
09:34 - it smaller yes
09:35 - now let's install Firebase into our
09:39 - reactor so we can simply
09:42 - uh where it is view not view terminal
09:45 - new terminal
09:47 - and let's first initialize Firebase
09:51 - okay let's add
09:54 - link
09:55 - din
09:57 - clone
09:59 - and continue
10:02 - then create a project
10:04 - let's wait
10:06 - for it to finish
10:09 - now the project is ready in wire base we
10:13 - can just go to continue or click
10:15 - continue
10:17 - so now what we have to do is we have to
10:19 - create a web application
10:20 - so click this click the icon here web
10:24 - and we can get started so let's make
10:27 - this as a app name so simple
10:32 - link
10:34 - din
10:35 - clone
10:37 - and a register app
10:41 - click it here
10:43 - and then we have to create a file
10:46 - in our
10:48 - project but first let's install Firebase
10:51 - using this command
10:53 - so do this
10:54 - then copy the entire thing from this
10:57 - configuration
10:59 - and create a file in Source folder which
11:03 - will be called as
11:05 - Firebase
11:09 - config dot Js
11:12 - and simply paste it like this
11:16 - we need this app
11:18 - variable that has been initialized from
11:21 - all this data
11:24 - I mean we have to initialize that
11:26 - getting input from Firebase
11:28 - and in this initialized app we are
11:31 - passing the configuration data all the
11:33 - API key auth domain storage bucket ID
11:37 - app ID and all
11:38 - so we have to export it
11:41 - so that we can use it into our project
11:45 - so
11:46 - it's getting installed I mean Firebase
11:48 - and it has done installing now let's
11:51 - start the app using npm run Dev
11:54 - enter
11:57 - so on this link it has been hosted in
12:00 - local so click it and it will open up
12:03 - here
12:04 - now let's move to app.jsx and clean a
12:07 - few things here I'm in the code
12:10 - remove the state for now and the logo
12:13 - and use data as well for now
12:17 - only then we will have a blank canvas
12:19 - for our project 2. be created
12:23 - let's change the color to this linen
12:25 - color
12:26 - and this color is
12:28 - let me check the color here
12:30 - so I have an extension called
12:32 - what font and if you click that it will
12:36 - show you the color of the background
12:40 - so it's rgba 0 0 and 0.9 as opacity
12:45 - so where is the black color in index.jsx
12:50 - so replace the diagram color with this
12:52 - color
12:53 - and if you check and refresh the page
12:56 - it's not changing okay okay let's have
12:59 - it as light then
13:02 - let me remove all the okay we have
13:04 - changed the color not in the background
13:05 - color sorry
13:07 - about it back end
13:09 - to it okay it's right yes now see it's
13:13 - working
13:15 - we can close the console for now and
13:18 - then we can change the color to black or
13:23 - say let me remove the color from here
13:27 - say we can I mean we can say two one two
13:29 - one two one black
13:31 - point
13:32 - we can also remove this a tags here and
13:35 - the a hover and let's see what else we
13:38 - have in the
13:40 - so we can also remove the buttons and
13:42 - meta queries
13:44 - and natural styling okay
13:47 - fine now save this and we have the color
13:50 - of LinkedIn
13:52 - I'm in the background color
13:54 - here
13:55 - fine the next step to do I mean what to
13:58 - do next is let me think let me close the
14:02 - width okay
14:04 - so we have Inver and we have imported
14:06 - all the data from Firebase to our app so
14:08 - let's click continue to console
14:11 - okay
14:12 - now
14:14 - first of all let's set up the project
14:17 - yes that was the plan
14:19 - so what we have to do is
14:21 - okay I'm also confusing getting confused
14:24 - okay let me close linking for now
14:27 - so
14:29 - in the Firebase we have this app
14:32 - so let's create endpoints in our app
14:35 - that can help us login and register
14:38 - first so we will cover them first
14:42 - so in the SRC create a folder called API
14:46 - and in this let's say
14:49 - auth
14:51 - API
14:53 - Dot jsx
14:56 - let me create a function here
14:58 - so say export
15:00 - const
15:01 - or Alexis not auth API say login
15:04 - API
15:06 - which will be an error function
15:09 - like this now we have to call this login
15:12 - API into our
15:14 - let's say a page called login so we have
15:16 - to create that as well
15:18 - create a folder called
15:19 - pages and in the previous folder let's
15:23 - create a file called
15:25 - login Dot jsx
15:29 - make it a functional component
15:32 - now we have this page for login
15:34 - but let's also create a component here
15:36 - for login so create a folder called
15:39 - components
15:41 - in the folder create a file
15:43 - called login.jsx
15:46 - or say not login say login component.jsx
15:54 - like this
15:55 - we have this let me expand it a little
15:58 - bit
15:59 - let me make it a functional component
16:01 - and add one H1 here
16:06 - login component
16:09 - now we have to import the logging
16:11 - component to the login page so say
16:13 - import
16:15 - login component from components login
16:17 - and then simply return it here
16:21 - like this
16:22 - now we have to
16:24 - create routes yes that's also we need to
16:26 - do
16:27 - so go to this website called react
16:30 - router
16:31 - I mean search it on the Google
16:33 - then we will have this version 6.4
16:37 - as the latest version so click tutorial
16:40 - here
16:41 - then we have to install it using this
16:43 - command
16:44 - so again open the terminal
16:46 - new terminal and simply put here and
16:50 - enter
16:52 - then it will be installed here
16:55 - okay
16:56 - we can eliminate our app.jsx we can make
17:00 - the main file as main.j6 because
17:03 - every Logic for routing should be
17:05 - written here
17:06 - so let's do that
17:08 - let me import these two things here
17:11 - create browser router and router
17:13 - provider
17:14 - so let me do it here
17:16 - but
17:18 - this array we have called router we can
17:20 - make it in a different folder
17:22 - so let me create a folder called
17:25 - routes and in this folder we will have
17:30 - let's say
17:31 - make it index Dot jsx because this is
17:35 - the only file we need here
17:37 - okay now we can I mean remove this and
17:41 - copy the link I mean copy this array and
17:45 - paste it here
17:46 - and Export the cons router
17:48 - okay sorry export yes
17:52 - so we have it here
17:56 - so to use this create browser router we
17:59 - have to import it from react router Dom
18:03 - so let's import it and remove the other
18:06 - thing router provider so okay
18:11 - here we have this route for the slash
18:14 - page I mean slash out the path and the
18:16 - div is hello Vibe I mean the output
18:18 - so let me import the login page here so
18:21 - say import login from Pages login
18:24 - and replace
18:26 - this hello world with this page
18:30 - and make the route as login
18:33 - fine now we have to import this router
18:37 - to main.jsx
18:39 - so let me both import
18:42 - router
18:45 - okay wait a second
18:50 - we have to do it like this
18:52 - import
18:53 - router from routes yes and then
18:58 - we have to feed this router
19:00 - to this router provider to replace app
19:04 - because we don't need app we can bypass
19:07 - the need for this approaches file
19:10 - so we are done here we don't need this
19:12 - create router so remove it and remove
19:14 - app as well
19:16 - now save this file and see what happens
19:19 - so
19:21 - what is the problem here the problem is
19:24 - no problem
19:25 - where all this
19:26 - slash dot which means no route so if you
19:29 - go to login page
19:30 - we should see the login component here
19:33 - as you see also
19:34 - so this is done now we have a login page
19:39 - fine
19:40 - now what we need to wish close the main
19:42 - dot j6 we don't need this and delete the
19:46 - app.jsx as well
19:48 - and the CSS file as well
19:51 - okay let's relate it
19:54 - sign I mean fine
19:56 - so also close the index.js X for now in
19:59 - routes
20:00 - to remove login page and let's see what
20:03 - can we do next yes so in the login API
20:06 - we have
20:07 - let me import this login API
20:11 - to
20:13 - this page
20:15 - but wait a second
20:17 - we can do it like this as well okay let
20:19 - me import the login API in the
20:22 - components login component.jsx
20:26 - or we can import it in the pages folder
20:29 - as well
20:31 - here
20:32 - so we can say import
20:35 - login API what is the name of it
20:39 - login
20:42 - API from API slash auth I mean API slash
20:47 - auth API
20:48 - so basically it is a function
20:51 - so we can call it so for example
20:54 - let's say we have a button here into
20:56 - this login API
20:59 - so first of all okay let me import this
21:02 - into our components page here
21:06 - fine now suppose that we have a button
21:09 - here
21:10 - that sales log in to link
21:15 - edin if
21:18 - we have a button here
21:19 - so let's say I mean let me check the
21:22 - button it's this okay
21:25 - fine okay so let me give some styling to
21:30 - the button some basic styling
21:32 - it's a class name
21:34 - uh login
21:37 - button
21:39 - and we can create a file for The Styling
21:43 - as well
21:44 - so let me create or let me solve one
21:46 - more Library called SAS so we can say
21:48 - npmi sass
21:51 - this will allow us to use scss not just
21:55 - CSS
21:56 - then we can create a file called
22:00 - login or let me create a file in one
22:04 - more folder called
22:05 - let's say s a s s and here
22:10 - the file will be called as login
22:13 - page
22:14 - or component
22:17 - dot jsx sorry not jsx scss sorry
22:22 - now we have to import the file login
22:25 - component Dot scss from this component I
22:28 - mean from this folder called SAS so say
22:30 - import
22:33 - so says
22:36 - uh
22:38 - slash login
22:41 - component Dot scss
22:44 - now the Styles we will write in this
22:46 - component will be reflected here in the
22:48 - UI
22:49 - so say login button
22:52 - let's add it here
22:55 - and say something like uh
22:58 - with
23:00 - 500 pixels
23:01 - okay it's too much let's try 300
23:05 - or 200
23:07 - or say 100.
23:10 - or 150.
23:13 - fine now let's add the height here
23:19 - as 30 pixels
23:22 - we have the button in this let's add log
23:26 - in
23:28 - to LinkedIn in small case okay just
23:32 - this is a such a button a simple button
23:35 - now we have to make the login API call
23:38 - and
23:40 - a function so say const
23:42 - let's say log in
23:45 - equal to another function
23:48 - and then we have to call this login API
23:51 - simple as that
23:53 - now on this button let's have an on
23:55 - click event
23:58 - on click
24:00 - equals to
24:03 - just login
24:05 - now when we when we click the button
24:07 - also let me add one more thing here
24:09 - called
24:10 - cursor pointer
24:12 - background color as blue
24:15 - what is the color for LinkedIn
24:18 - just add
24:20 - cyan
24:22 - okay it's too bright so let's add
24:25 - two one two one two one that's black for
24:27 - now fine now it flux
24:30 - now what will happen when we click the
24:33 - button here they should run this
24:35 - function called login and then it should
24:37 - call as login API from
24:40 - this auth API
24:42 - so
24:43 - let's just some know something like
24:46 - console.log
24:50 - hello
24:51 - from login
24:53 - API
24:55 - and save this now open the console
24:59 - make it at bottom
25:02 - and click the button here
25:06 - okay we're not seeing anything
25:08 - so it is calling this function
25:11 - login API
25:13 - and it's not getting consoled
25:19 - okay
25:20 - is the app running so let me check
25:25 - yes it's running what is the problem
25:28 - cannot
25:30 - could not establish connection okay let
25:33 - me refresh the page
25:34 - and click login yes now we are getting
25:36 - it
25:37 - fine hello from login API
25:41 - so this is not going to work for us
25:43 - because we have to change it so let's
25:46 - return something
25:47 - so let's return
25:51 - let's say
25:52 - hello
25:54 - from login API
25:56 - now we have to record the return from
25:59 - here into our
26:01 - login number in.jsx inside login
26:03 - function so say let
26:06 - res equal to this
26:08 - then we can simply console
26:11 - .log
26:13 - or yes
26:15 - now click the button called login to
26:17 - LinkedIn and we will get the same thing
26:19 - here
26:21 - hello from login API
26:23 - let's send it to login apis
26:26 - just for distinction
26:28 - and okay let me refresh the page
26:31 - and click it and we will get it here
26:33 - like this
26:35 - so this is how it works
26:37 - in the auth API and in the auth API we
26:40 - have login API
26:42 - let me write the API or the
26:45 - function to login
26:48 - so go to the settings page
26:51 - okay sorry not settings click all
26:53 - products here
26:54 - click Authentication
26:58 - now in the authentications we have this
27:01 - where where one second
27:04 - okay we can resize it more fine I think
27:06 - it's looking fine
27:08 - let's get started here okay
27:12 - let it load for now
27:14 - then we need the email and password
27:16 - login for now just to show you how it
27:18 - works the Firebase login
27:20 - so enable this click save
27:24 - and it's enabled
27:27 - now if you see in the users it's empty
27:31 - so
27:33 - let me import a few things from here I
27:36 - mean here so we can import
27:39 - what is the function name let me add the
27:42 - Firebase first
27:44 - so from Firebase I mean Firebase
27:47 - slash auth
27:50 - and here let's import
27:53 - sign in with email and password and get
27:56 - auth
27:57 - I think that's the things we need
28:00 - so say let auth to S and say get off
28:05 - so this auth will contain all your data
28:08 - in the project for authentication coming
28:11 - from the config file but we have to
28:14 - import this app into our main file as
28:17 - well so we can say
28:18 - import
28:20 - app
28:22 - this constant app
28:25 - from
28:29 - Firebase config and Save
28:32 - just need to import this don't need to
28:34 - use it and that's all
28:36 - now this auth will contain all your data
28:38 - and now we have to use this function
28:42 - time in the email password so we can
28:44 - remove this
28:46 - and add it here
28:48 - in this we have to pass our login data
28:52 - like the username or email and password
28:55 - so say it takes two parameters function
28:57 - called
28:58 - email comma password
29:02 - and we have to pass it here with the
29:05 - auth so auth
29:07 - comma email comma password
29:10 - so three things three things it will
29:12 - take
29:13 - so save it for now
29:15 - now let's come to this page and create
29:18 - two input fields
29:21 - so say input here it will be
29:24 - class name
29:26 - say
29:30 - uh let's say comma input
29:35 - and add a placeholder
29:40 - holder
29:42 - equals to which will be enter
29:46 - your email
29:48 - save and we should get it here
29:52 - okay but something is wrong here
29:55 - need to provide options when not being
29:57 - deployed to housing Source in initialize
29:59 - app what is this I am getting this just
30:02 - now
30:05 - let's check this
30:07 - Firebase needs to provide options when
30:10 - not to when not being deployed to
30:12 - hosting wire source
30:14 - so in this file we have to import the
30:16 - auth
30:17 - from our Firebase config file which is
30:21 - this
30:22 - and Export it
30:25 - so we are importing auth from Firebase
30:27 - config then fitting the data to this
30:30 - function called sign in with email
30:32 - password from Firebase auth so it's done
30:36 - here now we have to wrap
30:38 - this in try catch block so say try
30:43 - and this will go inside the try
30:45 - but if you save the file we will have an
30:48 - error which will ask us to add add a
30:51 - catch block
30:54 - and say error
30:55 - then return err so we don't need a DOT
30:58 - here fine
31:00 - fine say save it and we have the login
31:02 - API so I have also fixed the login
31:05 - components and the credentials are
31:08 - getting set here using on change event
31:10 - so this is a pretty basic basic stuff
31:14 - now this button is linked to this
31:18 - function
31:19 - so now we can import and we have
31:21 - imported the login API from here
31:24 - from API auth API then we can call it
31:28 - this login API
31:30 - like this but we have to feed the
31:33 - credentials to this login APK
31:36 - so we can say credentials dot email
31:39 - comma credentials not password
31:43 - so it takes two things as params which
31:47 - is email and password
31:49 - and I mean the function takes the two
31:52 - but the sign in with email password
31:54 - takes three auth from config file and
31:58 - email and password from the function
31:59 - params
32:01 - so save this let me record the response
32:05 - in one variable but first we have to
32:07 - return it from here so let's say it
32:10 - response it is
32:13 - response equals to this
32:16 - and have a console.log here
32:22 - which is sorry not console log return
32:25 - response
32:28 - so that it comes here from the function
32:32 - so let's get it here let's say it's lit
32:35 - res from here
32:36 - and console
32:40 - DOT log
32:42 - Ras
32:44 - now open the console
32:49 - and enter your email account which is
32:51 - this
32:53 - at the red Gmail
32:56 - .com so I have not signed up or added my
33:00 - account in Firebase and if you see this
33:03 - user's tab is empty but we are still
33:06 - tried logging in I mean we are trying to
33:08 - log in
33:09 - let me add some passwords
33:11 - and click login to LinkedIn
33:14 - and you will see this alert that says
33:17 - Firebase error auth slash user not found
33:21 - because
33:23 - this user it not it's not present inside
33:26 - the Firebase authentication users tab
33:30 - if you open the Android networks tab you
33:32 - will see this block
33:34 - we have error
33:37 - then inside the error we have errors and
33:40 - the message
33:42 - so we can filter it out or just do
33:45 - this here alert
33:50 - I mean ARR error dot errors Dot message
33:56 - now save this and click the button again
34:00 - and
34:01 - you will still get the same thing okay
34:04 - you will not found
34:09 - so let me refresh and try again
34:12 - and my email
34:17 - com one two three four five six seven
34:22 - okay we're not getting it here so I
34:24 - guess we have to add the try cash block
34:25 - here as well
34:28 - so try let me copy and I mean cut it
34:33 - paste in here
34:34 - then we have a we need a catch block to
34:37 - catch the errors
34:39 - so if we have an error we will simply
34:41 - console
34:43 - DOT log
34:45 - this thing basically this so let me
34:48 - revert it back
34:49 - to error I mean return error
34:53 - and paste it here save both files and
34:56 - now let's try
34:58 - so open the console
35:02 - click the button
35:03 - and still we are not getting it properly
35:06 - what's the problem
35:07 - hmm
35:09 - refresh it once I think we have a
35:11 - refresh issue in my PC
35:14 - Nishant that's 440 at the Gmail
35:18 - .com one two three four five six seven
35:22 - login to LinkedIn
35:24 - hmm
35:26 - tell nothing we are getting
35:28 - okay so we have error
35:31 - we have errors
35:32 - and we have message and we have code
35:35 - so let's try the code here
35:39 - or what if we add it here what happens
35:42 - let's try in both cases Maybe
35:44 - the error will be here in the
35:47 - dry block
35:49 - okay it's undefined
35:53 - um
35:54 - okay fine
35:56 - so okay let's leave it for now we will
35:58 - try to enter it later because
36:02 - this is just a code setup
36:05 - so the basic example I gave you was this
36:10 - you can remove it from here
36:13 - and from here
36:15 - so
36:17 - we have a login page and One login API
36:21 - that's calling this method called sign
36:24 - in with email and password but we have
36:26 - no users that is why it's showing this
36:29 - error that user not found
36:32 - so that was the setup if you want one
36:35 - more API for register
36:36 - so we can say export
36:39 - const
36:42 - register API okay let me just copy this
36:45 - and add it here and change the name to
36:48 - register
36:50 - API here
36:52 - so this will take email and password the
36:54 - same way it tick it took here
36:56 - but the function name will be different
36:58 - here so we can say
37:00 - create user with imminent password
37:03 - so this will create the user I can show
37:07 - you how it works so just let me call
37:10 - this function called registered API and
37:13 - pass the imminent password
37:16 - so let me clear all these things
37:18 - and let me log in
37:20 - I mean click the button
37:23 - so if you open the networks tab
37:25 - we will see these two messages
37:28 - I mean the
37:31 - what is it this is the
37:33 - Network request to sign up
37:36 - so we have email here and all the things
37:39 - that it's the simple tokens
37:43 - so it expires in three six zero zero
37:46 - milliseconds so maybe it means
37:49 - or it's seconds I don't know what is
37:51 - this maybe 36 hours fine
37:54 - so
37:56 - if we refresh the file back console we
37:59 - will see the user here and the provider
38:01 - will be this email I mean email password
38:06 - so we have highlight here okay we don't
38:09 - need this for now
38:10 - so that is how the register function
38:13 - works let me invert this back to login
38:15 - API now if you try to log into the same
38:17 - account or the imminent password
38:20 - we will be logged in I mean we will not
38:22 - get an error
38:24 - so let me bring back the console logs
38:27 - and login with LinkedIn
38:30 - so
38:33 - we will see
38:34 - that we're not saying anything
38:38 - I guess we have to make the function
38:39 - synchronous
38:41 - I mean asynchronous so where it is
38:43 - the async
38:46 - and let's avoid this
38:50 - now try again
38:52 - now we are getting it so the provider is
38:55 - called
38:57 - I mean optional option operation type is
39:00 - called sign in
39:01 - we have the user so basically we can
39:03 - utilize
39:05 - this user
39:07 - to have the username and all
39:10 - so we have the email we have the
39:13 - verified false and all the data
39:16 - fine we have the provider IDs Firebase
39:18 - all listings
39:20 - but we don't have display name so to get
39:23 - the display name we have to use the
39:25 - Google authentication from Firebase so
39:28 - let me show you this add new provider we
39:32 - have Google
39:33 - so that's how we can use the Google to
39:37 - have the display name as well which will
39:39 - have the name of your Gmail account
39:41 - so that's much the basic setup pretty
39:44 - much the basic setup of
39:46 - the Firebase apis and the components and
39:50 - the pages routes and all
39:52 - in the next video we will finish the
39:55 - login page and the registered page UI
39:58 - with the complete flow of the logging in
40:02 - registry
40:04 - users
40:05 - on your LinkedIn clone app
40:11 - we will see how to create login and the
40:13 - registered page in LinkedIn I mean these
40:17 - Pages this is the sign in page and if
40:20 - you click this button called join now
40:21 - you will see the registered page where
40:24 - you can create an account
40:26 - so I will create the UI for this too in
40:29 - this video
40:30 - but first if you go to the wheat app
40:33 - the Home Route I mean slash route is
40:36 - empty
40:37 - so we have to change it
40:39 - so go to routes index.js X and remove
40:43 - login
40:45 - for now and now we will get this login
40:47 - component on the page load which is no
40:50 - route
40:52 - now let me remove
40:54 - I mean let me okay leave the leave all
40:57 - these things let me
40:59 - see how to I mean we have to create this
41:01 - okay
41:02 - so
41:03 - first on the top we have the logo so
41:06 - let's create the logo first
41:08 - and we need the LinkedIn PNG image for
41:11 - this
41:12 - so we can get it from here so we can
41:14 - search on Google that we need a LinkedIn
41:17 - PNG logo
41:20 - so let me see which PNG that we can use
41:25 - let me see let me see let's try
41:28 - this image for now
41:34 - okay so to save it just click the button
41:36 - called download this PNG
41:39 - and it will download
41:43 - yes so it's processing Okay click the
41:46 - alphabets in order to download PNG web
41:48 - to pass a test
41:50 - so the order is as
41:54 - seven
41:56 - uh where is f and r
42:00 - so we have passed the test now let's
42:03 - create a folder here called assets
42:07 - which will contain all our images and
42:10 - assets but it's already here
42:13 - yes
42:15 - so all we need to do is just drag and
42:17 - drop this image into the assets folder
42:20 - and let me name the
42:23 - file to this file name called
42:26 - LinkedIn logo dot PNG
42:29 - make sure to make it camel case
42:33 - okay now we have to import this logo
42:36 - into our in login Dot Login component
42:40 - yes
42:41 - so we can say import
42:43 - link
42:45 - din logo
42:47 - from
42:50 - okay
42:51 - assets slash the file name
42:55 - and then return it inside one image tag
42:59 - so let me remove one last two all these
43:02 - two
43:02 - and see
43:04 - it's here on the top I mean top left
43:08 - so let me just comment out all of these
43:10 - items first
43:11 - so that we can have a blank canvas
43:15 - here
43:16 - so here we can simply say
43:18 - sorry image or IMG SRC
43:23 - LinkedIn logo
43:25 - and save this so we have this logo here
43:28 - we have to customize it according to the
43:30 - size on the LinkedIn page so say class
43:33 - name
43:34 - they should be
43:36 - LinkedIn logo
43:40 - so copy the class and come over to this
43:44 - SAS and the login message
43:45 - scss file
43:48 - so LinkedIn logo
43:50 - this will be let's say
43:54 - uh width
43:57 - 50 or 40px okay it's too small let's say
44:01 - 80 try the size
44:03 - okay
44:05 - it's 80 okay now we have to move it on
44:08 - the top
44:10 - so we can try this position absolute
44:16 - top
44:17 - 20 pixels
44:19 - and left
44:21 - 20 pixels
44:22 - now this logo is on the Top If you
44:25 - scroll I mean if you zoom up zoom in the
44:29 - logo will be still the same at the same
44:31 - place
44:32 - so that's done
44:34 - fine
44:35 - okay
44:36 - now the next thing to do is we have to
44:39 - create the sign in header and all these
44:43 - things
44:44 - the input fails forget password field
44:47 - sign in
44:48 - and basically in this part we will cover
44:51 - the login and sign up UI I think I have
44:54 - made it clear earlier as well
44:57 - so let me uncomment
44:59 - this thing which is the login H1 I just
45:03 - cut it from here and paste it after the
45:05 - image
45:06 - so we will get it here
45:09 - but we have to make it as sign in so
45:12 - just add sign in here
45:15 - and we're getting it here but the
45:16 - problem is
45:18 - it is in the center I mean here
45:20 - so I have to fix that as well so let me
45:23 - go to the integral CSS
45:25 - and see
45:27 - the okay it's I think here
45:31 - we don't need
45:33 - all these items so let me just comment
45:35 - out these for now
45:36 - it goes on the top okay fine so
45:39 - basically it means
45:41 - if we remove these stylings position
45:44 - absolute
45:45 - we will get it like this
45:47 - fine in the sign in page
45:50 - so we can remove this okay and also
45:53 - remove the login wrapper contents
45:57 - now we have this but we have to arrange
46:00 - the sign in H1
46:02 - so to do that give it a class name
46:05 - of
46:06 - heading
46:09 - and copy the class
46:12 - come to login wrapper class and we have
46:15 - to append this like this so in the login
46:17 - wrapper we are heading
46:19 - and we have to make this in the center
46:24 - or not the center I mean here with some
46:26 - margin on the left so we can say margin
46:29 - left
46:31 - 40 pixels let's try
46:34 - or 80
46:36 - guess too small
46:39 - let's try okay let's do this okay
46:45 - what can we do here
46:46 - what if we make it 180
46:49 - okay that's fine I guess
46:53 - or let's make 200. margin okay that's
46:58 - fine
46:59 - fine now next step to next step is to
47:03 - make the
47:04 - uh change the font size and weights and
47:06 - the font style
47:08 - so let's check what font is this so this
47:11 - font name is system UI
47:14 - okay
47:15 - so we can choose our own font from
47:17 - Google font so say go font google.com go
47:20 - to this website
47:22 - and let me choose a few fonts here like
47:24 - Roboto
47:27 - okay let me remove the existing fonts as
47:30 - existing fonts from before
47:32 - or we can just use these fonts that I
47:35 - already have here
47:36 - to import them in the main dot jsx sorry
47:39 - not jsx index.scss file
47:43 - like this so at the top import all the
47:46 - fonts
47:47 - okay not like this
47:49 - wait a second just say import here
47:53 - yes
47:54 - and now we can use all these fonts here
47:58 - I think we can also use system UI so if
48:01 - we try this
48:03 - let's say
48:04 - font style
48:06 - oh sorry font family this time UI yes
48:10 - now it is like this
48:12 - if you check here the font
48:15 - let's see the same thing we have here is
48:17 - this system UI
48:19 - but we also have the 400 which is the
48:23 - font weight so make font weight as 400.
48:28 - now what else we have
48:30 - font size 16 pixels so say
48:34 - font size what is it 16 pixels
48:38 - then we have color let's say color
48:43 - this color rgba 0.0 I mean 0 0 0.99
48:47 - capacity
48:48 - now save and we will get it here but
48:51 - it's very much small
48:54 - to remove the font
48:56 - size
48:57 - and I think it will work
48:59 - okay it's
49:01 - what if you make this 500 okay
49:04 - this looks pretty much like this
49:06 - fine now we have to make one more
49:10 - uh description header which is
49:13 - stay updated on your professional world
49:15 - so we can just copy the text here
49:18 - and add it here
49:21 - and it will be here as well
49:24 - so the same will be on the P tag
49:26 - so just like we have
49:29 - in the heading let's make this as
49:31 - subheading
49:32 - so say class name sub
49:35 - heading
49:37 - copy this class
49:39 - and add it here
49:42 - just make margin left 200 pixels
49:45 - like this
49:47 - I guess we are doing
49:49 - it okay fine it looks fine
49:52 - but we have to adjust the top margins so
49:55 - say
49:55 - margin top minus 30 pixels
49:59 - or 25 will also work
50:02 - that is too much
50:03 - or yes I think let's try 20 also
50:08 - yes it looks fine also we need the font
50:12 - family system UI here as well
50:15 - so added
50:16 - and just like this we have this
50:19 - also if you see the color of the
50:21 - background this is not
50:23 - Grace it is white
50:25 - so if you hover this the color will be
50:29 - the same okay
50:30 - let's try the login wrapper class here
50:34 - change the color inside
50:36 - so in the login wrapper make background
50:38 - color as white
50:42 - and this will be here
50:44 - okay it's not fully on the screen but
50:46 - it's fine
50:48 - so we have to adjust a little things as
50:51 - well for example
50:53 - in this page
50:55 - let's add a body
50:58 - and do margin 0
51:02 - and padding zero I think that will work
51:05 - here okay also let me add the height
51:09 - to 50 VH
51:12 - sorry not 50 100 BH
51:15 - but it's not working
51:17 - okay let me see font weight height okay
51:20 - I think
51:21 - if we create a screen here
51:24 - it will be working I mean if we create
51:28 - the other input Fields it will expand
51:32 - but if we make this as important it's
51:34 - not working
51:36 - fine so
51:39 - let's say
51:41 - index.css we have
51:43 - we don't have any height here so where
51:45 - does the height coming from
51:47 - okay so let's leave it for now
51:50 - fine
51:52 - now now now now let's make the input
51:55 - Fields so
51:56 - let me uncomment
51:58 - I mean just
52:01 - remove the comments from here and let's
52:04 - see the screen status
52:06 - so yes we have it here
52:09 - fine
52:10 - so in the auth inputs we have to make
52:12 - changes
52:14 - fine these are display Flex Direction
52:16 - column and all but we have to make
52:19 - them shrink
52:21 - so we can save width
52:23 - let's say
52:24 - 100 pixels try 100 okay it's too small
52:28 - 200
52:31 - or so small let's try 300.
52:35 - thank you
52:36 - a little bit more so make it 400
52:39 - okay 400
52:42 - I think that's it now we have to make
52:45 - them in the center so say align items
52:47 - enter
52:49 - okay now if we do that it is getting
52:52 - shrinked
52:53 - so we can make it 500
52:56 - okay that's how it is
52:58 - removal and items and simple add the
53:02 - margin left 200 pixels
53:05 - okay let's try this
53:07 - yes it's another so the width should be
53:11 - not 450.
53:13 - or 300
53:17 - fine so we have this two fields for
53:20 - email and password
53:22 - but we have to style them as well
53:24 - according to LinkedIn
53:27 - so
53:30 - okay so what can we do here so this
53:33 - here we have like this
53:37 - so let me think
53:41 - let me change the replace folder first
53:42 - so it says email or phone so say
53:47 - email or phone
53:50 - and simple it is password and second one
53:54 - like this
53:56 - so the height of this is little bit more
53:59 - so say 40 pixels height here and it will
54:03 - increase
54:04 - now we have to change
54:07 - the
54:08 - background color for the common inputs
54:11 - with the background color
54:12 - White
54:14 - so it's white
54:16 - fine also we have a outline on them so
54:20 - we have to remove that as well
54:21 - so outline will be none
54:25 - and also one more thing we need is
54:27 - border
54:29 - so border will be
54:31 - none as well so try none first
54:34 - okay it completely moves the Border fine
54:37 - so it's the outline sorry border one
54:40 - pixels
54:42 - solid
54:44 - this okay let's say two one two one two
54:47 - one
54:51 - two one two one two one
54:54 - okay now we have the borders on them
54:56 - but if you hover them the Border changes
54:59 - to
55:00 - blue
55:02 - so I think this is our client so try one
55:05 - pixel solid
55:08 - let's try some blue color
55:11 - first add blue and just adjust it from
55:15 - this Color Picker
55:17 - I mean like this so let's try
55:21 - which color to try
55:24 - this color fine
55:26 - now try this
55:29 - okay it's not visible properly so I
55:31 - guess we don't have to do this
55:33 - just cut it and make it as none
55:39 - then we have to make a
55:42 - common input
55:45 - and we have to choose this so it is
55:48 - a property called Focus
55:52 - Focus so when we focus on the inputs the
55:55 - color should change to the suborder
55:58 - at this
56:00 - okay now maybe it's outlined here
56:06 - yes now it's working
56:09 - we have this outline here but let's
56:11 - change the color
56:13 - where we can't see okay because the
56:15 - color we can't see because the color is
56:17 - white here
56:19 - so remove this
56:20 - just remove the or just make it as
56:24 - two one two one two one and we will have
56:27 - this
56:30 - but if we remove it completely what
56:32 - happens then we don't see the
56:36 - placeholder for here I mean
56:39 - email or phone so let me refresh the
56:41 - page okay now we are saying it
56:43 - fine
56:45 - so I don't know which color is this so
56:47 - let's try to find out or just change it
56:51 - to this
56:55 - okay
56:57 - it looks fine for now
57:00 - okay now we have to change the color of
57:02 - the placeholder
57:04 - fine so what we need to do is just add a
57:08 - placeholder class here just like it was
57:10 - before
57:11 - place
57:13 - folder
57:15 - and in the placeholder we have to
57:18 - add this font which is system a y again
57:23 - so where does this font system UI
57:27 - and we can add it here
57:29 - and check what happens when we save
57:31 - okay it has been changed Also let's try
57:34 - the phone size a little bit more so 20
57:36 - pixels
57:38 - it's too much let's try 18.
57:43 - yes
57:44 - also we need some margin on the top so
57:47 - margin top 5 pixels on the placeholder
57:50 - or if you try 15 okay it's not working
57:54 - so make it 16 and see
57:56 - okay 16 is fine
57:59 - okay also you see the border is curved
58:02 - around on the edges so we have to change
58:05 - that
58:06 - so we can say border radius
58:10 - let's say 5 pixels
58:12 - yes now they are curved
58:15 - but 5 is too much I guess let's try
58:18 - three
58:19 - okay three is also fine
58:22 - okay
58:24 - fine so what is next here
58:28 - background colored VR so if we type
58:31 - anything here we cannot see the text
58:33 - so why is that
58:38 - Let me refresh and enter my email okay
58:41 - let me do this as well in the input
58:43 - let's make the type as
58:48 - email and in this input second input
58:51 - make the type as password
58:56 - okay
58:58 - we cannot see the output here
59:01 - okay let's add color
59:04 - which will be
59:06 - 2 1 2 1 2 1.
59:09 - okay now we can see that
59:12 - so
59:13 - here also the font family should be
59:16 - system UI
59:21 - so that we can see the same font here as
59:23 - well
59:24 - Also let's add the font size here
59:27 - which is 16 pixels
59:29 - now these look these look fine much
59:32 - better
59:34 - okay
59:35 - now now we have to
59:39 - make a sign in button here
59:40 - or convert the button to sign in button
59:43 - so in the login button
59:46 - we have margin top as 20 pixels
59:50 - but we have to add this
59:53 - margin left
59:55 - 200.
59:58 - so if you add it here
60:00 - this will be here
60:02 - just like this but why don't we create a
60:05 - div here and wrap all of these items and
60:08 - make one margin left as 200 so make a
60:11 - div here
60:15 - remember to exclude the image here I
60:17 - mean the LinkedIn logo from there
60:20 - then in this div add a class of
60:24 - login
60:26 - wrapper
60:28 - so copy this class
60:31 - and add it in this page which is okay we
60:35 - already have login wrapper
60:37 - so let's say login wrapper inner
60:39 - okay
60:41 - so in this login wrapper we have login
60:45 - wrapper inner
60:47 - in this we can add margin left 200
60:50 - pixels only once
60:52 - and remove from everywhere else
60:55 - so here I mean from here
60:58 - then from here
61:00 - then from here and we'll save it and
61:03 - they will get the same thing
61:05 - okay
61:07 - now we have to design the button so
61:09 - login button class we have here
61:13 - so wait where is it here so let me
61:16 - remove
61:17 - the width let's make the width to Auto
61:20 - but it will not work we have to make the
61:23 - bit
61:24 - according to the size of the inputs
61:27 - so what is the sign of the inputs
61:30 - where it is
61:32 - 300 pixels
61:34 - so make the same here and it's perfect
61:38 - but the color is different so we can try
61:41 - the blue color and to get the references
61:44 - from the color or for the color we can
61:46 - visit this site called material UI
61:51 - material
61:54 - UI
61:57 - so here we can search for colors
62:03 - okay where did the search what happened
62:06 - colors
62:09 - and
62:12 - or we can do this as well so we can say
62:14 - LinkedIn
62:15 - color code
62:18 - so it is this
62:19 - zero zero seven to B1
62:22 - in HEX code
62:23 - we can just copy this
62:25 - and
62:27 - so this scss allows us to create
62:29 - variables so we can say
62:32 - dollar
62:33 - okay not dollar how to create variables
62:35 - says so say
62:37 - how to create
62:39 - variables in
62:41 - says
62:47 - yes
62:50 - so let's try
62:52 - the color name
62:54 - which is
62:56 - LinkedIn
62:58 - blue
63:01 - and add the color but it's not work it
63:03 - will not work like that
63:05 - so we are having some problem style
63:08 - rules
63:10 - let's try stack overflow
63:14 - hmm
63:17 - okay we have to wrap it in a
63:20 - string but still not working
63:24 - hmm
63:25 - [Music]
63:30 - let's search for this
63:34 - variable CS we need this
63:37 - we need to create a variable
63:40 - so
63:42 - okay so make a dollar sign
63:46 - okay not here in the color
63:49 - and
63:51 - it will work also add one semicolon
63:54 - now you can use the LinkedIn blue
63:56 - anywhere
63:59 - so just copy this link in blue and add
64:04 - it here
64:05 - in
64:06 - the login button color
64:08 - here
64:10 - save
64:11 - and if you check the calendar will be
64:13 - changed
64:15 - the same thing we can do to this border
64:17 - here that we have on the input fields
64:21 - so where is it the Border
64:24 - here
64:27 - and we will have it here yes it's now
64:30 - perfect
64:32 - let me close all of these things
64:35 - also if you notice we have some margin
64:37 - on the inputs I mean yes
64:40 - so
64:42 - we can say margin
64:45 - 30 pixels
64:48 - let's check
64:50 - 30
64:51 - or 0.
64:53 - or 0 30. yes
64:57 - if we make it 10
65:00 - okay make it zero and this will be 10.
65:05 - fine
65:07 - okay
65:09 - now we have to make the button as sign
65:11 - in so make the text as
65:14 - sine
65:15 - in
65:17 - I think I is smaller here change it to I
65:21 - small
65:24 - Pine now we can do what
65:28 - so we have to adjust the height
65:31 - of the button
65:33 - also we can remove the margin top from
65:35 - here because we don't need it
65:38 - okay
65:39 - now
65:40 - just make the height as 40 excels
65:44 - and okay try 50 as well
65:48 - the height will be changed
65:50 - now the color
65:52 - okay the color is already here
65:55 - okay wait a second
65:57 - login button we have only once here
66:00 - no we have it twice that's the problem
66:03 - so remove one colors or remove one class
66:08 - and go to second one and replace this
66:11 - height to 50.
66:12 - okay
66:14 - now see the water is curved so
66:17 - make border radius
66:19 - 30 pixels let's try yes also remove the
66:23 - outline
66:28 - and
66:29 - the border for now
66:35 - so we will have the button just like
66:37 - LinkedIn
66:39 - but if you want to check the color of
66:41 - this button just click inspect when
66:45 - clicking right clicking the button
66:47 - and check the CSS
66:51 - so the color is
66:54 - um
66:56 - 7 3 b100731
67:00 - okay it's 7 2 b 1
67:02 - just make this as London colored or blue
67:07 - one
67:08 - and say
67:10 - blue
67:12 - two
67:13 - so here we will have seven three not
67:16 - seven two
67:18 - like this and wherever we have LinkedIn
67:22 - blue make it linking blue one
67:24 - and here also
67:27 - but wait here it should be two now save
67:31 - this and let's see
67:32 - okay undefined variable LinkedIn blue
67:36 - blue yes make it two
67:38 - now we have it here
67:42 - okay
67:43 - that's fine
67:44 - now if you hover this button the font
67:47 - size is same which is system UI
67:49 - so just copy the font size and add it in
67:52 - login button
67:53 - and now let's check
67:55 - also
67:57 - a few things to be noted here is
67:59 - the font family okay I mean for not
68:03 - family
68:04 - Point weight is 600.
68:07 - added
68:08 - then we have colored as FFF so color
68:14 - ffff
68:16 - okay six times
68:18 - fine then I think it's all
68:21 - here
68:23 - so we can exit part font and save this
68:26 - to see what happens
68:28 - okay let me add font size as well
68:32 - 20 pixels
68:34 - yes I think it's perfect but if you make
68:38 - it 19 or 18 let's see what happens okay
68:41 - it's perfect
68:43 - now and let's add a hover effect on this
68:48 - so login button hover
68:53 - we just need to change the color
68:55 - so say background color
68:57 - as something so let's add one more color
69:01 - LinkedIn blue three
69:06 - and
69:08 - we have to make some darker variant of
69:10 - this color so just slide the marker
69:13 - down
69:16 - and change this to 3 where it is
69:21 - and Save
69:23 - now if you hover we will see the same
69:25 - thing here
69:26 - that we have on the screen
69:28 - fine
69:29 - okay where is the button button button
69:32 - ads let's add margin top
69:36 - 20 pixels
69:38 - that's fine
69:42 - okay now what we have to do is we have
69:45 - to make this thing
69:48 - so we will not use sign in with Google
69:50 - account we will use the
69:53 - uh only which I mean we will only use
69:55 - sign in with Google account not Apple
69:57 - fine so
70:00 - we can make one
70:02 - HR here
70:03 - HR for the HR where it is r
70:07 - here and Save
70:09 - so you will get one horizontal line here
70:12 - fine so we have to make this outside
70:14 - this div
70:16 - INE fine and let's try to Type R inside
70:20 - okay the problem is we need to create
70:24 - one HR with or between them
70:27 - so let's say text between
70:31 - HR tag
70:34 - let's try this
70:37 - okay we can in HR class data content we
70:41 - have a property
70:42 - so you can try this
70:46 - so make it a self closing tag then
70:55 - save this
70:57 - okay it's not working because we can
71:00 - give this a class of HR text
71:04 - fine
71:05 - and then check the CSS
71:09 - so where it is HR text it's here
71:12 - so we can just copy
71:15 - the whole class and add it here in the
71:19 - CSS
71:21 - okay now we have this so let's change
71:24 - this and
71:25 - to or
71:27 - we will have this
71:29 - we have to change the color so let's
71:32 - change it to
71:34 - a darker variant
71:37 - this
71:38 - now it's changed okay not this
71:41 - okay where is the color color background
71:43 - color
71:45 - okay I think I think I think
71:50 - this is the color is this
71:53 - let's try this no this is the font color
71:58 - okay okay let's leave it for now hmm
72:03 - we have this R and after or we have the
72:05 - button called sign in Google account so
72:09 - we have one more thing for you to show
72:10 - you
72:11 - so
72:13 - we can create the button or we can
72:17 - import a library which is called
72:20 - Google
72:23 - signed in button
72:31 - so we can check this react Google button
72:35 - foreign
72:39 - so just install the package here
72:42 - where is the ndim command to install it
72:46 - yes here it is
72:50 - open the terminal
72:52 - I mean the console
72:57 - and now let's see
73:00 - let's import the button here at the top
73:06 - then just copy the button and add it
73:10 - here
73:10 - after that Dave HR after the HR
73:14 - and we can
73:16 - see our button here
73:19 - fine
73:21 - so wrap this in a div
73:26 - and
73:28 - add the class name here which was
73:30 - login wrapper inner
73:37 - no but it will not work
73:39 - to say
73:41 - Google button
73:43 - here
73:44 - so just copy the class
73:46 - and let me add here at the bottom
73:51 - okay now what we have to do is we have
73:54 - to
73:55 - add this thing which is margin left 200
73:59 - pixels
74:00 - to the current class 10 that we created
74:03 - here save it and we will have it here so
74:07 - also we can add width 300 pixels
74:11 - to expand this or make it important I
74:14 - guess okay we have to add this on the
74:16 - button so say class name
74:21 - button
74:22 - I mean let's make this as Google button
74:25 - can
74:27 - container
74:29 - copy this class
74:31 - and just add it or replace it here
74:34 - in this
74:36 - we can have Google
74:39 - button
74:40 - and add the width inside here
74:43 - now just copy the Google Google button
74:46 - class and add it here
74:50 - I think we have to make this as
74:51 - important yes now it's working
74:54 - so we have sign in and sign in the
74:57 - Google account
74:58 - fine
74:59 - so now the next thing is to create this
75:02 - thing this join now
75:04 - option
75:06 - so let's do it in the same div so we can
75:09 - say A P tag
75:11 - and just copy this whole thing and add
75:15 - it here
75:18 - and you will have this but this join now
75:21 - it should be a span tag
75:28 - okay like this
75:30 - and in the pan let's see a class give a
75:33 - class name of
75:35 - join now
75:38 - so
75:41 - in the button container yes let's do it
75:44 - here
75:45 - the join now will be of color
75:51 - LinkedIn
75:52 - where is it the top linking blue one
75:56 - make it like this
76:00 - we have this also
76:02 - font
76:04 - family
76:07 - y
76:13 - um too much points are here
76:15 - so we only need system invoice so remove
76:17 - all the left all the other fonts
76:20 - we also need to add cursor as pointer
76:24 - so if you hover it
76:26 - the cursor will be changed to pointer
76:29 - also let's give this P tag a class name
76:32 - of
76:33 - go to
76:35 - sign
76:37 - up
76:43 - okay we should be
76:45 - after Google button okay in the
76:47 - container so we can do it here after the
76:49 - button
76:52 - and they should be text line as Center
76:54 - let's try this
76:56 - okay
76:58 - it's not fine
77:01 - so
77:03 - let's add margin a little bit from the
77:05 - left margin left
77:07 - in the top not top margin left
77:11 - uh 30 pixels
77:13 - or say 40. 50 okay that is fine
77:20 - now we have this
77:22 - go to sign up okay let's change the font
77:25 - size here font size
77:29 - as 20 pixels
77:32 - too much
77:34 - try 16 or 18 18 is fine
77:37 - copy the same and add it here in the
77:39 - class as well
77:41 - so we have this
77:43 - fine
77:44 - but if we zoom in it causes some
77:46 - problems in responsiveness but we will
77:48 - fix it later
77:49 - okay so now we have this done
77:53 - okay
77:54 - but the thing is we need to wrap I mean
77:58 - we have to make
77:59 - this entire color of the background as
78:02 - white
78:03 - so in this login wrapper let's check
78:09 - make the color as white and make it
78:11 - important I guess
78:13 - okay what if we add height
78:17 - as 100 VH okay now it's working
78:21 - perfectly yes
78:22 - we have this and fine
78:25 - now the login page is done pretty much I
78:28 - guess
78:28 - so let's hook up the these things here
78:31 - like
78:32 - I mean I think they're already hooked up
78:35 - so we can try signing in
78:37 - so we can add one email Nishan s4403
78:41 - Gmail
78:43 - .com and the password one two three four
78:47 - five six seven
78:49 - open the console
78:52 - and click sign in here
78:57 - and the request has been sent and we are
79:00 - getting messages
79:02 - so let me install one Library called
79:05 - react to specify
79:08 - react
79:09 - to specify
79:14 - so in this Library we will have a post
79:17 - message box that we can use
79:20 - so install it here
79:26 - then close the console or terminal then
79:29 - we have to import
79:31 - these things
79:33 - so where is the main component I mean
79:35 - main.jsx
79:37 - so we can import it here I mean the CSS
79:40 - and the toast container remove toast for
79:43 - now for now
79:44 - then we have to return this toast
79:47 - container in our
79:49 - Dom reference here in the react Dom
79:51 - create root just like we have in the
79:55 - just like we have as router provider now
79:58 - we can use this toast container
80:00 - so to use this go to this function and
80:06 - we can do toast
80:09 - so we have to import those from it's
80:11 - Auto imported those dot success
80:15 - and let's add the message
80:17 - if you look into the documentation here
80:19 - we should see it
80:22 - where it is yes toast dot success and
80:25 - the message say
80:27 - sign
80:30 - in
80:32 - to LinkedIn
80:34 - now save and let's try to sign in add my
80:37 - email
80:41 - and the password
80:46 - okay we are getting this message that we
80:48 - are signed in
80:50 - so
80:51 - we already I mean we also need one for
80:54 - error so if the password is wrong or
80:57 - something is wrong
80:58 - again simply throw
81:00 - this message
81:02 - please check your email and password
81:05 - your team or District credentials
81:09 - hidden
81:11 - Shields
81:12 - now let me try to change the password
81:14 - Here and sign in
81:17 - so we will see this message called
81:19 - please check your credentials
81:21 - fine so it's done
81:24 - okay
81:25 - now the next thing is to create the flow
81:28 - for the Google button sign in
81:30 - so we can just go to this page called
81:34 - uh sorry not page API
81:36 - OS api.jsx
81:38 - let me create one more function here
81:41 - called
81:42 - Google sign in API or Google yes sign in
81:46 - API so we have to import one thing also
81:50 - called
81:51 - um
81:51 - sign in with
81:54 - okay let's try Google auth provider
82:00 - I don't for I don't get the name I
82:02 - remember writing the name
82:08 - Okay Google Earth provider I think it is
82:11 - and sign in with pop-up
82:15 - okay now let me create one instance of
82:19 - this auth provider so
82:23 - we can do it this inside the function
82:25 - here select
82:28 - auth equals to
82:30 - uh no not auth
82:33 - Google provider
82:40 - equals to new
82:42 - Google dot provider
82:45 - fine
82:47 - then we have to pass this provider and
82:51 - the auth
82:53 - to this function sign in with pop-up
82:57 - so we can say this
82:59 - and we have to pass provider name oh I
83:03 - think first is the auth
83:05 - and then the provider
83:07 - then let's return this response from
83:10 - here so say let res equals to this
83:14 - and return
83:16 - Ras
83:17 - now import the function in the login
83:19 - component
83:21 - so
83:23 - yes from this message I mean where yes
83:27 - from here
83:29 - Google sign in API
83:35 - okay now we have to create a function
83:37 - here as well for
83:40 - Google provider sign in so say const
83:43 - time
83:46 - in
83:48 - or
83:51 - Google
83:53 - sign in
83:58 - and save the file in this we will call
84:02 - this sign in I mean Google sign in
84:05 - API
84:07 - we will record the response in a
84:09 - variable called response
84:14 - and simply console.log
84:17 - this
84:19 - response
84:22 - now we have to click the button and run
84:25 - the function called Google sign in
84:27 - so just remove all of the items all the
84:30 - Callback function and leave it at that
84:33 - but we need to enable the sign in
84:36 - Provider from Google so go to
84:37 - firebase.com
84:40 - I mean console
84:44 - now method sign in we have to add the
84:47 - provider called Google
84:49 - okay
84:51 - click this and enable
84:55 - add your email account and Save
84:58 - now let's see if it works or not
85:01 - so it's savings let's wait for it for
85:03 - few minutes
85:05 - or hours
85:07 - yes we have Google provider here
85:09 - but
85:10 - we have to remove this here because we
85:13 - will login with same email no matter the
85:16 - provider
85:17 - so let's see what happens when we sign
85:19 - in with say email but from Google
85:22 - so open the console and click the button
85:25 - called sign in with Google account
85:28 - so I am seeing one pop-up
85:32 - so if you did just like I did you can
85:34 - see that too
85:38 - I think we have to
85:40 - add the I mean yes we can see that
85:44 - we don't need to do anything so let me
85:46 - choose my email account
85:49 - on the pop-up that we got
85:52 - now if you check the console
85:56 - we are getting nothing okay
85:59 - let me see
86:01 - okay let me open the Inbox tab
86:05 - and try again
86:08 - sign in with Google
86:11 - choose my email
86:14 - and we are getting this
86:18 - yes see now we have the display name is
86:20 - Nishan Singh that is on my email
86:23 - if you refresh this Firebase console the
86:27 - provider will change to Google here
86:29 - okay fine let me log in with the other
86:33 - account
86:34 - my other email account
86:37 - this email
86:40 - so if you now check
86:42 - here in the Netflix tab
86:45 - we have this display name as same but
86:47 - the email is different it is this email
86:50 - and now if you check the console here
86:53 - we will be having this email here as
86:56 - well the providers will be Google
86:58 - fine now we have this Google sign in
87:01 - button that you can use to sign in
87:04 - fine so we don't need the register
87:08 - button I mean register page for this
87:11 - method for sign in with Google account
87:13 - it will automatically register you to
87:16 - that page
87:17 - now let me create the register page here
87:21 - so create one more file called
87:24 - register
87:28 - compo
87:29 - net Dot jsx
87:33 - and in this page also a file called
87:36 - register Dot jsx
87:40 - this will be a functional component just
87:42 - like login
87:44 - and we have to import this register
87:46 - component here
87:49 - import register component
87:54 - with the second wait is it okay we have
87:57 - to make it functional as well only then
87:59 - we can import it
88:02 - import register component here and
88:05 - simply return it here
88:09 - foreign
88:14 - we have to make all our things here but
88:16 - we have to add the routes as well first
88:19 - so click routes
88:20 - and create one more object and make this
88:24 - as
88:25 - register and cop I mean import the page
88:28 - called register
88:31 - register
88:34 - from
88:39 - Pages slash login sorry not login
88:42 - register
88:43 - and return it here
88:45 - now if you go to the registered page
88:47 - let's see what happens
88:54 - so you will see this registered
88:55 - component page here
88:57 - so now let's create the registered page
88:58 - and that same I mean it's pretty basic
89:02 - as this login page
89:04 - so now let's hook up this button coil
89:08 - join now to the registered page
89:11 - so on this click I mean on click we
89:14 - should have the Handler two transference
89:17 - to the register page
89:19 - for that we need a few things from the
89:21 - react router which is called
89:23 - use
89:24 - navigate
89:27 - fine let me create one instance of this
89:30 - navigate
89:32 - use navigate
89:35 - fine
89:36 - or we can create one helper function for
89:39 - this
89:40 - so let me try to create this or folder
89:42 - called
89:43 - helpers in this let's say
89:47 - use Navi git Dot jsx
89:53 - so we can copy I mean we can import the
89:56 - use navigate from react router Dom
90:00 - and then
90:01 - this navigate
90:05 - so let's say export
90:07 - this navigate
90:09 - and now let's try to use it but first we
90:12 - have to import it so import
90:16 - navigate from helpers
90:19 - you will navigate
90:21 - and on the join now we can say on click
90:30 - navigate and we have to add the route I
90:33 - mean we are passing the route here
90:35 - so
90:37 - let me create a function here so say
90:38 - const
90:39 - navigate
90:43 - and
90:45 - we can remove this and
90:48 - okay let's say
90:50 - just okay
90:52 - um
90:53 - let's say navigate instance
90:56 - just say instance
90:59 - so
91:00 - every time we click the button we will
91:03 - run this function called navigate
91:05 - from here
91:07 - we will pass
91:08 - the param
91:10 - and
91:11 - then we can simply say instance and in
91:14 - the instance we can pass the param to
91:16 - navigate to that page
91:18 - so we have to pass the route so say
91:21 - register
91:22 - now let's try this click the button call
91:25 - join now
91:26 - nothing is happening so let's check
91:29 - the console
91:36 - it let me fetch the page
91:39 - and
91:41 - use context
91:44 - okay hooks can be I think we have to
91:46 - make this a component
91:49 - so let me cut and make it function
91:50 - component
91:52 - and then add here
91:54 - don't need return for now
91:57 - don't need this okay
91:59 - import it at the top
92:04 - let me export this
92:08 - it will not work like that
92:11 - so I guess we have no choice so what is
92:14 - the problem let me see
92:19 - so hooks can be already called only
92:21 - called inside the body of react
92:23 - component and blah blah
92:26 - hmm
92:29 - so so so so
92:31 - okay we have to import react I guess
92:39 - we're not working okay let's let me
92:43 - add it here I mean we don't need to do
92:47 - all of these just
92:50 - create I mean import the you will
92:52 - navigate so let me
92:53 - control Z
92:56 - all these things
92:59 - let me figure this out and come back
93:01 - later but but for now let me do it like
93:04 - this
93:05 - so on the button we can on click
93:10 - navigate to the register page
93:14 - add a slash before the register string
93:18 - now let me replace the page
93:21 - now let me click this button
93:23 - and we will be on the registered page
93:25 - then that's fine
93:27 - okay now in this register let me see
93:30 - what is it here
93:33 - so we have the login logo I mean the
93:37 - logo and the strings
93:40 - so they can just copy
93:42 - this entire class names
93:45 - I mean all of these things for now
93:49 - copy and paste it here
93:54 - okay save this
93:56 - but we will need okay just let me copy
93:58 - the entire component and paste it here
94:01 - so that we don't have to build it from
94:02 - scratch
94:03 - just change the name to login name of
94:06 - login component to register component
94:10 - and on the registered page we will see
94:13 - the same thing now let me change this
94:15 - string which is make most of your
94:18 - professional life
94:20 - so
94:23 - on sign in we have to do this
94:25 - fine added
94:27 - we have this
94:28 - then we don't need the second Peak last
94:31 - name in the history component so remove
94:32 - this
94:34 - we have email and email or phone number
94:36 - here so let me add the
94:38 - placeholder here
94:46 - then we have password six or more
94:48 - characters
94:51 - okay let me add it here
94:57 - remove the empty spaces between them
94:59 - rings from strings
95:01 - and we have this
95:03 - then we have already on LinkedIn signed
95:06 - in so we have to change this as well
95:08 - here
95:08 - so where it is
95:11 - here
95:14 - sign in so just cut the text I mean copy
95:17 - the text and paste it and we can see it
95:20 - here but now this
95:22 - not now this route will be login route
95:27 - or slash out not login
95:29 - now click this button and it will be on
95:31 - the sign in page
95:33 - fine
95:34 - now
95:36 - we have this thing but I don't think we
95:39 - need this this terms and conditions and
95:42 - all also cyanide has been changed to
95:45 - agree and join so let's change it as
95:48 - well
95:51 - agree and
95:55 - join what is spelling of join g o I can
95:58 - save and we have this here
96:01 - fine
96:02 - so we have no sign in page and the login
96:04 - page but the thing is
96:07 - we don't need to use the login API here
96:11 - we have to use registered API so go to
96:13 - this API page orthoped.jsx
96:18 - and
96:20 - import registered API not login API
96:24 - so here we place the login API
96:27 - with registered API
96:29 - and Save
96:31 - so we can say
96:33 - uh you or just say account
96:38 - created
96:40 - you can change the those messages as
96:42 - well
96:43 - so here let's say cannot
96:47 - create
96:48 - your account
96:50 - so in case we cannot create an account
96:53 - this will
96:54 - show this toast message called cannot
96:57 - create your account
96:58 - let's try this
97:01 - now we already have two accounts here
97:03 - which is this and this so let's try to
97:06 - create account using these two
97:08 - and let's see what happens
97:11 - so we can add nishanth s440 at the rate
97:17 - gmail.com and the password
97:21 - so click agree and join
97:24 - and we will see this thing cannot create
97:27 - your account because we already have
97:28 - this account in the console
97:31 - now if you change something like slide
97:34 - email changes then click again join
97:37 - we will see account created because now
97:40 - we have an account on Firebase with this
97:43 - email and the provider is this
97:47 - fine
97:48 - now let me do the last thing here
97:50 - which is called transferring us to the
97:53 - home page
97:54 - so we can save pages
97:56 - create one page called home.jsx
98:00 - make it a functional component
98:02 - similarly create one component for home
98:04 - the home
98:06 - component Dot jsx
98:08 - same as functional component
98:10 - now import this home component inside
98:13 - this page so say import home component
98:15 - here
98:17 - and
98:19 - return it here
98:22 - like this
98:24 - make this as an H1 here
98:26 - to highlight it
98:30 - now save this
98:32 - okay
98:34 - fine
98:36 - so when we are registering we should be
98:38 - on the home page or when we are logging
98:41 - in
98:41 - in that case as well we should be on the
98:43 - login page sorry on the home page
98:46 - so
98:47 - we can say uh what is the name history
98:50 - dot push
98:53 - sorry not history sorry sorry navigate
98:57 - to
98:58 - slash home
99:00 - but we don't need we have to create the
99:02 - routes here so in the index.jsx in
99:05 - routes
99:06 - replicate the object
99:08 - make the Home Route here
99:10 - then import the home page so the import
99:14 - from Pages home and return the element
99:17 - class I mean element component
99:20 - now if you go to home page we should see
99:22 - the home text in H1
99:24 - see
99:25 - now
99:27 - on this login success or related success
99:31 - we are getting navigated to home page we
99:35 - have to do with this in the login page
99:36 - as well
99:39 - in this function so after all signing in
99:41 - we should see this
99:44 - so in this as well I mean in Google sign
99:46 - in
99:47 - we should
99:48 - transfer us to the home page
99:52 - now let's try to sign in and see what
99:54 - happens
99:55 - add my email or just click the button of
99:58 - Google sign in
100:03 - okay
100:05 - we are first getting the sign in page I
100:07 - mean home component and then we're
100:09 - signing in so we have to fix that and
100:13 - that's for the next video
100:15 - let me sign in with this
100:17 - so gmail.com one two three four five six
100:21 - seven click sign in
100:24 - okay we have to check the credentials
100:27 - okay
100:30 - okay let me try
100:32 - this here
100:36 - click sign in
100:37 - now we are on the home component and we
100:40 - are having this toast called signed into
100:42 - LinkedIn
100:44 - and in the next video we will handle
100:47 - the predicted routes and the home page
100:51 - basically so thank you for watching my
100:53 - video
100:54 - on the second I mean second part of the
100:56 - series on how to create a LinkedIn loan
101:00 - using react and Firebase
101:06 - let's see how to check the
101:08 - authentication States
101:09 - for the application
101:12 - I mean when we're logged in or when
101:14 - we're logged out
101:16 - so come to the homepage.jsx we have home
101:19 - component and in login we have login
101:21 - component
101:22 - so
101:24 - we need a function so it is called
101:28 - import
101:31 - on off State change
101:33 - fine same way Import in the login page
101:38 - let's we will edit
101:41 - and
101:42 - let me import the use effect hook
101:48 - same way in the login page
101:51 - and now
101:53 - we will create the effect so say use the
101:55 - effect
102:00 - and in the use effect we will call this
102:03 - function called on or state changed
102:06 - so this will take our authentication
102:08 - variable
102:09 - from this Firebase config file so same
102:12 - port
102:14 - auth from Firebase config so we have to
102:17 - feed it here
102:18 - then it sends us a response as callback
102:23 - so we can say console
102:27 - dot release sorry console.log res
102:31 - save it so let's go back to the home
102:35 - page I mean slash home
102:37 - open the console now
102:42 - so we are getting this user impl or it
102:45 - means the data so it contains all the
102:48 - data like email that we used to sign in
102:50 - display name and all so we need the
102:53 - access token
102:55 - so
102:56 - we can filter it out like this
102:59 - the same thing we need to do is in here
103:02 - so just copy the effect use effect and
103:05 - add it here
103:07 - and Save
103:09 - so save it here as well
103:11 - in the login we have used effect which
103:14 - with this or not State changed and here
103:17 - as well
103:18 - it's fine
103:20 - okay we've absolutely both auth and
103:24 - edit I mean import it here
103:27 - now come to the login page and we will
103:29 - see this same thing
103:31 - the authentication token
103:33 - so we have to check here
103:37 - if this token exists
103:39 - we have to
103:41 - go to the login home page so we can
103:45 - then navigate
103:49 - to
103:50 - slash
103:51 - home
103:52 - now we need to navigate so let me import
103:55 - it here import
103:59 - you will navigate from react router Dom
104:02 - and say let
104:05 - Navi gate equals to use navigate
104:10 - so do the same thing in the home page
104:15 - and here as well
104:20 - save and Save
104:24 - so
104:27 - we have to also get this checked from
104:30 - here and add it here
104:33 - but here in the home page we have we
104:36 - will have the condition as opposite or
104:39 - reverse
104:40 - so if this token is not here go back to
104:43 - the login page or else state of the home
104:46 - page that we don't need to write
104:48 - so if you go to the login page now it
104:51 - will throw us back to the home page
104:52 - instantly
104:54 - fine
104:55 - so but it's not instantly it takes some
104:59 - time
105:00 - so we can add a loader here
105:02 - so let me install one Library here
105:05 - called okay what library should be
105:08 - installed so let's install aren't design
105:12 - a and t d
105:15 - and Design
105:18 - second most popular UI Library
105:21 - or react
105:25 - so click development here
105:28 - we need to install it so we can do it
105:31 - like this using NVM install aren't ready
105:34 - so open the terminal
105:38 - and
105:39 - paste the command
105:42 - meanwhile when like it is stalling let's
105:45 - make let's create a component
105:47 - so in the folder called components
105:49 - create one more folder called common so
105:52 - it will it will contain our common
105:54 - components like this loader Dot jsx
106:00 - so fine it's done I mean it's getting
106:03 - installed
106:04 - now what are the additional things that
106:07 - we need to do to use on design
106:10 - hmm
106:13 - so so we have to
106:16 - just do our
106:18 - copy this let's try
106:27 - okay I think something else we need to
106:29 - do
106:31 - so what
106:33 - design
106:36 - okay it's not here
106:39 - I'm using it after so long click
106:42 - components
106:43 - okay let's try this
106:45 - fine
106:46 - so in the loader we need a functional
106:48 - component fine then we can search loader
106:52 - here
106:53 - or not loader spinner
106:56 - in this
106:58 - all right
107:00 - so we can choose any spinner
107:02 - for example let's choose the spinner
107:05 - import space and spin
107:07 - so I don't know what is the space
107:10 - so then we have to copy the screen large
107:13 - and add it in the div
107:17 - fine
107:19 - space okay we have to
107:21 - let's try I mean add the space here as
107:23 - well
107:25 - and Save
107:27 - now let me import this loader component
107:29 - in this home page
107:32 - so import
107:34 - loader from components common loader
107:38 - and if
107:41 - else we have simply turn
107:45 - this loader
107:47 - now we are on the home page
107:50 - we have to replicate this in the login
107:53 - page as well
107:55 - for that let's also import this loader
107:57 - component
107:59 - like this
108:01 - now go to the login page
108:06 - and
108:07 - we don't see anything it's loading
108:11 - so what could be the problem
108:18 - I guess we don't have to do it here
108:20 - so what can we do
108:24 - let me remove this
108:26 - [Applause]
108:29 - and
108:30 - this from here
108:36 - okay I think it has been crashed
108:39 - open the view in terminal
108:42 - okay it's reloading okay
108:46 - let's try this again
108:50 - it was loading
108:52 - okay it's now loaded we can refresh the
108:54 - page
108:56 - let me go to the login page
108:58 - and
109:00 - we can I mean we don't need we don't see
109:03 - this loader here
109:04 - so I guess we need a state here so
109:07 - create a state called
109:09 - loading and set loading
109:13 - use state
109:17 - let's say false initially
109:19 - okay not false sorry true
109:22 - so also import the state Hook from react
109:24 - you state
109:26 - so
109:28 - when we will have else here this set
109:32 - loading will be sent or set to false
109:36 - so that
109:39 - if okay one second
109:41 - okay let's try this
109:43 - so here I will create a check so if
109:45 - loading is true
109:47 - it means we need to show the loader this
109:49 - component
109:53 - or else we have to show the login
109:54 - component
109:56 - so in the login let's go to login now
109:58 - and try this
109:59 - so LCL order and then the home component
110:01 - yes it's working
110:03 - the same thing can be done here
110:06 - so we need this loading state
110:09 - and use statehood
110:12 - then
110:14 - if loading is true I mean set loading we
110:16 - have to do here
110:18 - also
110:19 - in the false version of this
110:22 - then if loading
110:26 - is true then we will have home component
110:29 - sorry not home component the loader
110:36 - else we will have the home component
110:40 - so if you go to the home I mean to the
110:43 - login page
110:44 - we will sell order
110:46 - and within
110:48 - we will see the home component so it's
110:50 - working
110:50 - it's fine
110:53 - so if loading is true here
110:55 - it means
110:57 - remain in the log on the home page if
111:00 - loading is true
111:02 - I mean if this is false it means we need
111:05 - to be the on the home page okay
111:07 - fine let's save it for now
111:09 - I also I'm not getting what I'm saying
111:12 - so in this loader giveness Diva class
111:15 - name
111:15 - of
111:17 - loader
111:19 - and we have to make the loader in the
111:21 - center
111:23 - so
111:24 - we can create one more file called
111:27 - uh loader or just say common
111:33 - node scss
111:35 - let me import the common file into
111:40 - this okay and we have to import the
111:42 - common file into this
111:44 - file called
111:46 - loaded.jsx so we can say import
111:51 - common
111:52 - Dot scss
111:54 - and if we write The Styling here for the
111:57 - loader let's say display of flex
112:01 - and let me just do this for now
112:04 - remove this
112:07 - and if you refresh the page
112:13 - okay let's make this as
112:17 - just revert the loading State now we
112:19 - will save the downloader only
112:22 - so if you go to the home page
112:26 - I think it's compiling our code
112:30 - let me open this in the new tab
112:33 - okay now we see the loader only
112:35 - yes so display Flex
112:39 - justify content Center
112:42 - align items Center
112:45 - let's make the height as
112:47 - fifth t
112:51 - v h
112:52 - and say okay 50 is less let's let's make
112:56 - 100
112:57 - now we have this loader you can also add
113:00 - a text here so say loading
113:06 - please wait
113:09 - we will have this
113:11 - so in this loader we have to make one
113:14 - more thing called
113:15 - Flex direction as column
113:18 - fine also let's add some Gap 20 pixels
113:22 - between them
113:23 - and we will have this
113:26 - fine let me make this as a P tag
113:31 - and fine
113:33 - so if you do this we have to decrease
113:36 - the Gap as 10. fine we have this loading
113:39 - placement
113:40 - if you want styling let's add P tag here
113:45 - and make the font family as
113:49 - what is the what was the font so in SAS
113:54 - we have this
113:55 - the font was system UI
113:59 - and also copy the stylings
114:02 - other styling
114:03 - now we have this
114:05 - Also let's make font size as 20 pixels
114:09 - now it's fine
114:11 - now we can close the common clss yes
114:14 - and what if we import the common scss
114:18 - into the login component
114:20 - or even better in the index.css so that
114:24 - we don't have to use it every time
114:27 - I mean we don't have to import it every
114:29 - time
114:30 - so we have changed this CSS to scss
114:33 - so we have to change here as well
114:36 - so now save
114:37 - and it will work the same
114:40 - now in this index.css let's make import
114:46 - URL
114:49 - I mean one step back assets not sorry
114:52 - not assets
114:53 - uh two steps back what happens
114:56 - one step back yes components common
115:00 - common dot CSS
115:02 - so if you are doing this we can remove
115:04 - it from here and it will work
115:07 - so let me show you how it will work if
115:09 - you remove this
115:11 - and give it a refresh
115:13 - this styling will be reverted back to
115:15 - the original styling that it had
115:16 - previously
115:18 - fine
115:20 - so it works and it works
115:23 - fine so now let me divide this back to
115:26 - loading if loading is true
115:28 - or if you go to the login page we will
115:32 - see loading and then the home component
115:35 - fine
115:36 - so that's how in the on or straight
115:38 - changed or not State change works
115:42 - in
115:43 - from Firebase in react or in any other
115:47 - Library
115:48 - so I think that's all for now and in the
115:51 - next video we will learn how to use this
115:55 - reactant I mean how to create the top
115:57 - bar from LinkedIn so let me show you
115:59 - what I mean
116:00 - so if you open LinkedIn
116:03 - let me go to the home page you see this
116:05 - top bar have we have here which contains
116:07 - the logo the search option home page and
116:11 - all all the icons
116:16 - now let's create the top bar
116:19 - in the LinkedIn clone
116:22 - the first step to do that is to create a
116:25 - folder called
116:27 - uh sorry not the folder yes a folder but
116:30 - in the common folder so say
116:33 - um
116:34 - top bar
116:36 - in this top bar we will have an index.j6
116:39 - file
116:40 - for writing the style I mean the HTML
116:43 - and one for the styling
116:46 - fine
116:47 - so make it a function component and just
116:50 - change this to
116:51 - top bar and import the index.ss file
116:56 - here so import
116:59 - index Dot scss
117:03 - now we have this top bar here
117:06 - by the way I have made a few changes
117:08 - here for example
117:10 - in this login okay I have not made it
117:12 - but let's make it yes
117:14 - so
117:16 - replace this margin left with this so
117:19 - display Flex
117:21 - Flex Direction column
117:26 - and justify content Center align item
117:29 - Center
117:31 - and just do the same thing
117:33 - at a place where we have like this other
117:36 - margin left 200 pixels
117:39 - so I have done that to make sure that
117:41 - the screen says I main screen stays
117:44 - responsive
117:46 - let me show you what I mean so come to
117:48 - the pages folder and open the login page
117:51 - so let me remove this check here for now
117:55 - I mean let me remove this navigate to
117:58 - home
117:59 - and in the home page as well
118:02 - now let's come to the login page
118:04 - and we will see this page as responsive
118:07 - but okay do this as well
118:10 - name this loading State here
118:13 - now let's check
118:15 - okay right okay okay
118:17 - I guess
118:20 - oh what can we do okay let me just
118:25 - revert this to this and remove this from
118:29 - here
118:30 - now we can go to the login page
118:33 - okay it's
118:36 - getting unresponsive
118:39 - [Music]
118:40 - so go to the
118:42 - site again and we will see this as in
118:46 - the perfect Center even if you
118:49 - maximize this page
118:51 - so that's what we did now
118:53 - in the login component.scss
118:56 - now let me divide this back
118:59 - and save now refresh and the same same
119:03 - thing will happen again because we have
119:04 - changed
119:05 - this condition for authentication now we
119:08 - have home component
119:10 - now let me copy sorry not copy let me
119:13 - import the Stop Bar in
119:16 - this page called
119:18 - home page so come to okay let's import
119:21 - it
119:21 - in the home component first
119:25 - so home component it's here
119:28 - or or plenty way to do that is to create
119:31 - a folder called layouts
119:35 - in this page I mean in the folder let's
119:39 - make a layout for home so say home
119:41 - layout Dot jsx
119:45 - now in this layouts page we will have
119:47 - the functional component
119:49 - and here we will import the home page
119:52 - so import home from
119:55 - Pages slash home
119:58 - now we have to return it here
120:02 - fine we have returned it here
120:05 - so nothing is changing we can send the
120:08 - home component but it will change I mean
120:10 - it will not change
120:12 - because we have to import the home
120:15 - layout.jsx into the routes
120:17 - index
120:19 - so replace this home with the layout so
120:23 - say
120:24 - layout
120:26 - I mean layout slash home layout
120:29 - and add this here
120:31 - now save and the same thing will be here
120:34 - and fine
120:36 - now let's import this top bar from the
120:40 - in from this component here
120:42 - so we can say import
120:46 - top
120:48 - bar from this component and render it
120:51 - before home so that we can see it on the
120:54 - top like this
120:56 - now we don't need the layout we only
120:58 - need
120:58 - these two files in the same folder the
121:01 - top bar and we are going to work inside
121:03 - them
121:05 - so let me remove the text from here
121:08 - like this and Save
121:11 - so nothing we have
121:13 - so let's give this Diva class name of
121:15 - let's say
121:17 - top bar Main
121:20 - copy the class come to index.cl scss and
121:25 - say
121:27 - width as 100 pixels or hundred percent
121:30 - not pixels
121:32 - I should be
121:34 - let's say 50 pixels
121:36 - now we will see that this home component
121:39 - H1 has been margined down to this place
121:44 - let's add the color
121:46 - so it's the background color let's add a
121:48 - red color just for demonstration
121:51 - and we will see this thing just like we
121:54 - have here
121:55 - so but the color should be different so
121:57 - let's get the color
121:59 - from this index.css which is this color
122:04 - fine
122:06 - so we can make
122:08 - one variable here
122:11 - so let's try that but I don't think okay
122:14 - let's leave it for now just add the
122:16 - color here we will do that by labeling
122:17 - later
122:19 - so we have this white color
122:21 - top bar here we can make the height to
122:24 - 60 VH or PX yes now it's fine
122:27 - now let me have the logo here so we can
122:30 - import the logo from the assets folder
122:33 - so it's LinkedIn logo.png so let me
122:37 - import
122:38 - import link
122:41 - din
122:43 - logo
122:45 - from assets
122:48 - from
122:50 - uh
122:52 - go back again go back go to assets
122:57 - slash this file name
123:01 - the whole file name LinkedIn logo
123:05 - save this
123:06 - now we can use this logo
123:08 - so in this top bar let's add an image
123:12 - tag or IMG tag and Source will be
123:15 - this LinkedIn logo let's add the alt tag
123:22 - and fine so it will be very much very
123:25 - much big so make a class name and say
123:28 - LinkedIn
123:30 - logo
123:32 - but I think we already had a class I
123:34 - mean we have a class here
123:36 - that we can use so come to the SAS and
123:39 - login component
123:41 - where it is let's try let's see
123:44 - login button login wrapper heading
123:47 - subheading
123:48 - LinkedIn logo
123:50 - yes this
123:53 - so
123:55 - we can add it here but we can change the
123:58 - class name
123:59 - or we can use let's try the class name
124:01 - here to see if it works or not
124:04 - yes it's working but we need to shrink
124:07 - it down even more not just a TPX
124:11 - so I guess
124:14 - just add it here but change
124:18 - something like divided back like this
124:21 - and let me copy the class and add it
124:23 - here
124:26 - sorry what is happening
124:28 - here we have to add
124:31 - so make it 70 let's try 70.
124:34 - okay try 65
124:38 - pixels and now I think it is fine
124:42 - we can also add margin left
124:45 - let's say 20 pixels
124:47 - yes let's also increase the size of this
124:50 - top bar let's make it 70.
124:54 - so if you are making it 70
124:56 - we have to make sure that every element
124:59 - inside the top bar should be on the
125:01 - center I mean vertically so we can add
125:04 - display of flex
125:07 - and align items Center
125:10 - now it's in the center as you see it has
125:12 - been moved
125:13 - now about the other icons let's say
125:15 - search home and all we need icons for
125:18 - this
125:19 - so let me import or I mean what let me
125:22 - install a library called react icons
125:25 - from npm
125:28 - so the command is here nbm install react
125:31 - icons
125:32 - and let me click or open the terminal
125:39 - and install this Library
125:42 - it's getting installed
125:45 - fine
125:46 - so we have the
125:47 - page here called react icons on GitHub
125:50 - where we can search the icons for
125:52 - example you see we have home here let's
125:55 - search for home
125:59 - and we will see a lot of icons here
126:02 - so you can choose your own icon so let
126:04 - me use this icon
126:06 - it has been copied to clipboard
126:09 - and then we can import it I mean just do
126:11 - this here but first let's see how to
126:14 - import an icon
126:16 - so
126:17 - let me go to the home page and to import
126:20 - it we can do this so this is the import
126:24 - command
126:26 - in the react I mean import yes now let
126:29 - me search for this icon here AI outlined
126:32 - home
126:34 - so we can add it here and see the
126:38 - type of Icon we are using is AI
126:41 - fine now we can just copy this icon as
126:46 - react component and render it here
126:50 - I think that will work
126:52 - okay will it work let me let me try
126:57 - um
126:58 - I think it should work but it's not
126:59 - working so let me refresh the page
127:02 - oh let me open the
127:06 - terminal
127:08 - I think it's getting Reloaded
127:10 - so let's wait for it
127:18 - um
127:23 - let me revert it back
127:25 - to
127:27 - this far beer and say what happens
127:37 - let me cut this and paste it in a new
127:40 - tab
127:42 - because my PC is getting slow uh slow
127:45 - and slow
127:46 - what is the problem here
127:52 - I think it's taking too much time to
127:56 - load
127:58 - foreign
128:15 - so let's wait for it to be responsive
128:17 - and
128:18 - just have the icon here yes now it's
128:22 - here
128:23 - I mean it's getting
128:24 - loaded
128:26 - yes so it has been optimized I guess
128:29 - so if you save this we will see the bear
128:31 - icon here but we need the home icon so
128:34 - say far
128:35 - I mean let's say AI
128:37 - and from AI we can import
128:40 - home so
128:42 - let's search for home and it has been
128:44 - copied if you click the icon
128:46 - and replace the bear with this icon
128:49 - now we have this home
128:50 - so
128:52 - what are the params that we need for
128:54 - this
128:55 - so let me check
128:58 - okay
128:59 - let me check the
129:02 - uh I think it's width
129:04 - wait can we check that
129:06 - let's try width
129:08 - width properties let's say 30 or 40. if
129:12 - you save
129:14 - it is not getting increased so I guess
129:17 - it should be 40. pixels
129:22 - okay um
129:24 - that is an prop that is a problem
129:29 - let's try npm here
129:34 - what is the
129:35 - I mean I mean how to
129:37 - add width here in the AI icons
129:45 - okay where I can provide a blah blah
129:47 - blah size yes size sorry not width
129:50 - size
129:52 - so psi should be 40.
129:54 - and we can remove these things
129:57 - now let's try yes it's fine what is
130:00 - perfect
130:03 - so it's a little bit large but it's fine
130:06 - fine now we have to wrap the icon all
130:09 - the icons from react icons in one div
130:13 - like this so that we can
130:15 - arrange them like this
130:18 - okay
130:19 - fine the next icon is this icon called
130:22 - profile so let me search for this in the
130:26 - library
130:28 - so it's not the profile let's use it so
130:30 - say users
130:31 - by the way we also use we will also use
130:34 - the AI like this I mean a icons so we
130:38 - can try this icon just for demonstration
130:40 - my friends
130:42 - and then we can copy this and paste it
130:46 - and add here the size will be same
130:50 - now we have to separate them so in the
130:53 - top bar main class we can have
130:56 - this so we have we are having display
130:58 - flex and we can say
131:01 - justify content
131:03 - face
131:05 - between
131:06 - justify content not self
131:09 - space between
131:14 - and Save
131:15 - so that is the problem they are being at
131:19 - the last
131:20 - so it takes
131:22 - I mean this top bar Main
131:25 - in the top bar main we have one image as
131:27 - a parent element and this device parent
131:29 - so they are on the opposite ends of this
131:33 - page so in this we have to make let's
131:37 - say react icons
131:40 - copy the class
131:42 - and let me add it here and do the same
131:46 - thing
131:48 - here fine
131:52 - we have to also add some width here so
131:55 - width should be hundred percent let's
131:56 - try 100
131:58 - okay it does the opposite so try
132:01 - 20. yes 20 is too much let's try 100 I
132:05 - mean 10. or 15
132:08 - yes 15 is a sign between them now let's
132:10 - quickly add the other icons
132:12 - I mean I don't need with I don't think
132:15 - we need to use this here so let's see
132:17 - what happens if we remove it
132:19 - it's much better
132:21 - but the distance between these two
132:24 - doesn't increase
132:25 - so we can have a margin left here
132:30 - I don't need this suggestions margin
132:33 - left
132:34 - 30 pixels
132:36 - yes that's fine also in the icons we can
132:40 - have one class name but we will do it
132:42 - later
132:43 - now the next icon is called this diff
132:46 - case icon
132:47 - so let me
132:49 - search for the briefcase icon here
132:55 - yes
132:56 - So currently no icons are from this
132:59 - Library called AI so we have to make it
133:01 - from other ones which is called BS or BS
133:05 - merits boost bootstrap
133:07 - so we can try this
133:10 - make this as
133:12 - slash BS
133:15 - then you can have this here
133:19 - and the size as 40
133:23 - now could not cut just copy this
133:26 - no save
133:28 - and it should load in a few minutes I
133:31 - guess
133:32 - because I think it's getting optimized
133:35 - from BS
133:37 - so let's wait for it
133:39 - yeah so it's loaded
133:41 - but see now the problem here is it is
133:44 - getting
133:46 - like this so we have to make the width
133:49 - to let's say Auto or 30 let's try 30.
133:54 - because it will be like if you add icons
133:58 - this will go down
134:00 - like it will sink
134:01 - the next thing we need icon is this
134:05 - let's try
134:10 - okay
134:11 - let's
134:13 - add a search icon
134:16 - this search
134:18 - and now we have this from AI outline
134:24 - they can come to this home page and at
134:27 - the search icon at the very first
134:32 - save and we have this so also now we can
134:36 - increase the width 35
134:38 - and here we have we have
134:42 - this icons
134:44 - which is the top bar icons
134:46 - fine
134:48 - now
134:49 - in all the I mean svgs or this
134:54 - icons give it a class name of
134:57 - let's say react icon single icon
135:02 - let me repeat it all over
135:07 - and let me copy the react icon and paste
135:10 - it here
135:12 - and say cursor should be of pointer
135:15 - now if you hover them the cursor will be
135:17 - of pointer
135:19 - let me make the search icon a little bit
135:21 - more smaller so that
135:23 - let's say 75 you're not here here
135:26 - and Save
135:28 - now I guess it's fine so what else is
135:30 - remaining here as icons we have
135:33 - messaging
135:34 - and we have
135:36 - this notification so let's add them also
135:39 - let's say message
135:44 - let me import it from here
135:47 - copy the briefcase
135:49 - and add two more one for messaging
135:52 - which is this and other four
135:55 - the
135:57 - notifications say Bell
136:01 - let's try this also from AI
136:05 - and replace this
136:08 - fine then we have it like this
136:12 - so we have to make it as 45 or 55 or 65
136:19 - but it's looking ugly so try okay it's
136:23 - ugly because I think we have to decrease
136:24 - the size of the icons let's see
136:27 - in all other sizes
136:31 - and we have it here
136:33 - now let's decrease the width to 55 or
136:37 - 45.
136:38 - now we have them as here
136:42 - but it's look it looks a little bit
136:45 - ugly yeah so I guess the let's try 55
136:48 - percent here and I think that's perfect
136:50 - for now so we have a search icon so make
136:54 - the search icon small so make it as
136:57 - 25
136:59 - or 30 will also work yes so let's leave
137:01 - it at 30. we have search icon home
137:04 - profile and all
137:06 - fine so but the thing is if you hover
137:09 - them the color changes
137:11 - so
137:13 - how to do that
137:14 - so let's try this I mean react icon
137:19 - uh hover class
137:22 - whatever it is and then the color should
137:26 - be let's say red
137:28 - when we hover them
137:31 - save
137:33 - and yes it's working it's red but we
137:36 - don't need red we need black
137:39 - so say
137:40 - two one two one two one
137:44 - so we already have black colored here so
137:46 - we have to change it here
137:48 - so we can make the color change here
137:51 - we have to make it grayish a little bit
137:53 - Gray
137:55 - so
137:56 - we can slide it like 5b5 5B yes if you
138:01 - know hover over them it will turn it
138:03 - turns to black or not black two one two
138:06 - one to one so let's make it pure black
138:09 - now it's much better
138:11 - we can use the hover effect
138:13 - we can make the color of the icon a
138:16 - little bit more
138:17 - on the gray on my I mean white side
138:20 - that looks premium type thing we have
138:23 - this effect
138:25 - now we have the top bar
138:28 - let's also add one more thing which is
138:30 - the user icon here
138:32 - a small user icon
138:34 - so we can have an image so first let me
138:38 - get an icon I mean the user icon that
138:41 - will that we will later replace
138:43 - with our own icon
138:46 - so we can have this icon
138:48 - spng let me download this
138:52 - any icon you can use
138:54 - the free download
138:57 - I have to sign in
139:00 - to download this
139:03 - so we don't need this what is this
139:06 - now to close this from here
139:09 - okay download PNG
139:12 - okay
139:15 - it's downloaded let's move the file to
139:18 - this assets folder and make it as
139:22 - user
139:23 - dot PNG
139:25 - let me import the file here
139:28 - here
139:30 - so import
139:32 - user
139:33 - from
139:37 - assets
139:40 - okay too much back routing assets and
139:46 - user dot PNG
139:50 - now we need one image tag just like this
139:53 - we have to add it here after the div
139:58 - IDE now save and we can close all the
140:01 - other icons
140:03 - I mean other tabs
140:05 - so here the source will be not Linked In
140:08 - but user
140:11 - and also the alt tag
140:14 - now we have this user but it's not a
140:17 - background I mean proper background
140:18 - image
140:19 - so
140:21 - let's search for another another one so
140:23 - user icon
140:26 - um in the images let's try
140:32 - let's try this but this we already used
140:36 - let's try from PNG tree okay this is the
140:38 - same
140:42 - download PNG okay
140:45 - it's not a background image so say
140:48 - user icon PNG that's how we search
140:52 - let me try from here user icons
140:58 - let's try this let's click download
141:00 - let's see PNG free
141:03 - let's see it 252 to 50.
141:06 - unlock all
141:07 - formats okay I think that is for free
141:10 - and this one as well so download this no
141:13 - matter
141:15 - and download it here it is move this to
141:18 - here assets
141:20 - and delete this page I mean release
141:22 - delete this file and make this as
141:25 - user dot PNG
141:29 - now let's see what happens
141:31 - if you try to refresh and now it's
141:33 - perfect
141:34 - but one thing to do is change the
141:37 - class name so you say user logo
141:41 - save and come to the index.scss
141:45 - and say user logo
141:47 - with 30 pixels
141:50 - too small huh 40
141:53 - okay 40 is fine
141:55 - also
141:57 - we have to make them on the right I mean
142:00 - top right
142:01 - so we can say position absolute
142:04 - right zero pixels
142:07 - I mean not zero in entirely make it 10
142:10 - or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50.
142:12 - now we have this user icon here
142:15 - let me also add the cursor as pointer
142:17 - so if you hover that cuts it if you
142:20 - hover this icon you will see
142:23 - the pointer cursor
142:26 - now we have all the top bar icons like
142:28 - search home this that and like
142:33 - here
142:34 - we have the user icon
142:36 - and the home component text
142:39 - so that's all for today I am in for this
142:41 - video and in the next video we will
142:43 - learn how to create the home page all
142:46 - the post requests and get requests
142:53 - now let's move on to the home page I am
142:55 - in this page in LinkedIn the feed page
142:58 - so click home
143:00 - by the way let me also create routes for
143:04 - the home I mean top bar yes
143:07 - so open this components
143:10 - common top bar index.jsx
143:13 - and let me create
143:16 - one function called navigate or say go
143:20 - to
143:23 - or go to route
143:27 - it will be an error function
143:29 - so on each of the items here we have to
143:32 - map I mean not map I'll assign this so
143:37 - on home we will say on click
143:41 - and we'll send
143:44 - the data
143:46 - to this function called go to route
143:49 - and this will be
143:51 - the current route of the page so here
143:55 - it's slash
143:58 - home
143:59 - now in this function
144:01 - let me first in let me first
144:04 - uh import the use effect hook sorry not
144:06 - use effect hook let me import the use
144:10 - navigate so we can say
144:12 - import use navigate from react router
144:16 - Dom
144:17 - then
144:18 - let me create an instance of the
144:20 - navigate so let's select
144:22 - navigate equals to use navigate
144:26 - now we can navigate through this
144:28 - navigate
144:29 - um
144:30 - by the way these things I mean this
144:32 - function takes a value
144:34 - so let's say route
144:36 - and here we will just navigate
144:39 - to route
144:41 - now if you click the home we'll be on
144:43 - the home page now let me add this on
144:47 - click on one more
144:48 - so let's say on this second one called
144:52 - user switch so let's say profile
144:57 - now save and click second one and we
145:00 - will go to the profile page
145:02 - but for now we will get this error
145:04 - because this page doesn't exist
145:07 - so if you go to profile we will see no
145:12 - page I mean the error so let's leave it
145:15 - for that I mean leave it for now
145:17 - okay
145:18 - now what to do is just go to home
145:20 - component and remove this H1
145:24 - now we have to replicate the entire
145:26 - thing from here but I mean not the
145:28 - entire thing just this post message box
145:31 - first
145:32 - so
145:33 - in this common let's create a folder
145:36 - called let's say
145:38 - uh
145:41 - post update
145:43 - in this component we will have an
145:46 - index.jsx
145:48 - and one for CSS or scss
145:53 - when the j6 file
145:55 - we will have
145:57 - what is what is what is what is
146:00 - happening
146:02 - we'll have
146:05 - post status
146:08 - now let me import okay not import first
146:12 - just import this scss file into this
146:16 - component
146:18 - now it's done
146:20 - now we have to import this post status
146:22 - in the home component so we can
146:25 - import it import
146:27 - status like this
146:30 - and return it here
146:35 - like this
146:36 - fine it's done
146:38 - now whatever we will do here we will
146:40 - wait selected here
146:41 - so let's first create this box
146:45 - so let me make a div here
146:48 - another div
146:52 - find save this div will be a this div
146:55 - will have a class name of let's say
146:57 - post status class
147:01 - now copy the class and come to
147:03 - index.scss for post status
147:06 - and
147:07 - let me create the card here first
147:10 - so we will do this
147:12 - what do I mean by this is
147:15 - with 100
147:18 - not 100 let's say ATP percent
147:21 - then height
147:23 - uh 100px let's try
147:26 - for now but I didn't think it should be
147:29 - 100 let's make it 50. now we need
147:32 - background color
147:33 - so let's make it white
147:36 - now save and let's check the
147:39 - page here we'll see this thing
147:42 - but it's not a card
147:44 - I mean yes it's a card but we have to
147:46 - arrange them arrange it also
147:49 - let's check the color here what color is
147:52 - this I think it's not white it's white
147:55 - smoke
147:56 - now we can try this and fine it's look
147:59 - it looks fine
148:00 - now we have to arrange this in the
148:02 - center
148:03 - so to do that
148:05 - in the home component of jsx make this
148:08 - as
148:08 - home
148:11 - component
148:14 - and copy this class
148:17 - come to this scss which is in SAS
148:22 - and let me add The Styling here for now
148:25 - so we will say display of flex
148:29 - justify content Center
148:31 - and let's see what happens
148:34 - align items Center
148:37 - but it disappeared I don't know why
148:41 - okay home component let's check the
148:43 - class what
148:45 - it should work but we don't see it here
148:48 - but why
148:49 - let me just comment out this and then we
148:52 - can see
148:54 - okay I guess the home component my post
148:58 - status okay let's do this in this
149:01 - component itself
149:02 - so give this
149:05 - class name of this parent div
149:08 - post status
149:12 - mail
149:17 - in this we will have the same class
149:21 - host
149:22 - let us
149:23 - mean
149:25 - and we will add it here
149:28 - save this as well now it's in the center
149:31 - but not vertically
149:33 - so we can give it a little bit margin
149:35 - from the top
149:37 - so let's move this class here
149:40 - fine
149:41 - now we have this I think 100 PX was fine
149:45 - yes
149:47 - now let's give them some margin at the
149:49 - top the margin top let's say 30 pixels
149:53 - is there
149:55 - fine
149:57 - okay let's try to make this as 120. okay
150:01 - it's also it's all it it's also looks
150:04 - fine it also looks fine
150:06 - we need one border 1px
150:10 - solid
150:11 - two one two one two one
150:13 - but this is too much
150:16 - dark to dark for us
150:18 - let's try to make them this
150:23 - still dark
150:24 - let's move it towards the white
150:28 - let's see okay this looks fine
150:31 - but still
150:33 - this should be fine yes
150:35 - now we have this box
150:37 - borders are curved so we can say border
150:39 - radius
150:41 - uh 10 pixels what happens
150:44 - then do we have 10 I think it's small
150:47 - let's try seven
150:49 - yes I guess seven is fine
150:52 - now in this we have a input I mean it's
150:55 - not an input
150:56 - it's a
150:58 - button type thing because if you click
151:01 - this we will open a model here
151:04 - so let's create that as well so in the
151:07 - post status let's add a button
151:11 - and this will be called as
151:14 - start a post
151:19 - now save we will have a button here
151:22 - give the button a class name of
151:25 - open
151:27 - post model
151:30 - copy the class come over here
151:34 - then do open post model
151:37 - then
151:38 - add this at the bottom
151:41 - I mean not the bottom let's make Center
151:43 - so if you want if you want to make it at
151:46 - Center we can do the here and do this
151:48 - here as well display Flex
151:50 - justify content Center
151:52 - align items Center
151:55 - yes it's in the center
151:57 - now all we have to do is expand this I
152:00 - mean give some weight 300 percent
152:04 - let's write 90 or 80 okay it is fine so
152:08 - now we need some height as well so try
152:10 - for TPX
152:12 - also so we have this startup host
152:15 - button
152:17 - but the problem is I mean the thing is
152:20 - the text inside the button this is on
152:23 - left aligned so we can say left I mean
152:26 - text line
152:27 - left
152:29 - let's try if it works or not
152:31 - yes it works now we have this
152:34 - but the color is black
152:36 - so we can say color black
152:40 - or not black entirely two one two one
152:43 - two one
152:44 - we have this
152:46 - now let's change the color of
152:49 - this button background color so say
152:52 - background color
152:53 - let's try this color
152:56 - fine
152:57 - also we can move to a lighter
153:00 - shade
153:02 - now it's fine it's gray we can do more
153:06 - lighter
153:08 - yes I guess it's fine let's remove the
153:11 - outline so the outline
153:13 - none
153:16 - also border will be none as well
153:23 - so we have this but I think we don't
153:25 - have zero border I mean non-border let's
153:28 - try one pixels solid
153:31 - and
153:33 - some color so let's try this color
153:40 - now we have this okay but the height is
153:44 - not 40 it slits 50.
153:46 - 50 also the
153:49 - border is curved around say border
153:51 - radius 30 pixels
153:53 - to make it rounded
153:56 - yes it's fine
153:58 - also cursor as pointer we need
154:03 - save and we will have let's add padding
154:06 - so say padding 10 pixels for this text
154:10 - or 15
154:13 - the text is inside this
154:16 - fine
154:17 - so now what we have to do is what
154:21 - change the font size of the of start a
154:25 - post
154:25 - so I gets the font size here is
154:29 - aerial
154:31 - so we can say
154:33 - font size sorry font family Ariel
154:39 - did this change or not
154:42 - yes it changed
154:44 - then we have
154:48 - we have
154:49 - okay it's not idealist system UI sorry I
154:53 - think I checked something wrong
154:56 - system UI
154:59 - we don't need all the other fonts
155:02 - save and I guess you will see this here
155:05 - just as LinkedIn
155:08 - other properties let's check
155:10 - so we have the font size 14 pixels
155:13 - weight 600 so
155:16 - wait I mean font weight
155:18 - which will be 600.
155:22 - color is this RGB and blah blah blah
155:26 - so we can replace the color with this
155:29 - so where is the color we don't have a
155:31 - color okay we do have a color here
155:33 - so let's replace
155:36 - and see we have start a post
155:42 - okay some thing is wrong
155:46 - here let's style this color
155:48 - it's too much on the light side this
155:53 - this is also too much light I mean not
155:55 - too much but fine this yes this looks
155:59 - now perfect
156:01 - we're gonna increase the font size so
156:03 - try that like font size

157:52 - you will find all the videos in this
157:54 - playlist check this playlist
157:56 - the model
157:59 - index Dot jsx paste the code here
158:04 - something is wrong
158:07 - okay it's not a functional yes it's a
158:10 - function but let's make it
158:12 - model
158:13 - and
158:15 - fine let's it is fine fine fine fine
158:19 - also let me clearance says or scss file
158:22 - so say index
158:26 - Dot scss
158:28 - let me import it here
158:31 - import
158:35 - index.scss
158:37 - now we can import this file
158:39 - into this post
158:42 - update component
158:45 - so import
158:47 - model
158:52 - okay
158:54 - let's try look from local I want to
158:57 - import
158:58 - so
158:59 - model
159:01 - and just render it here
159:06 - OKAY model has already been declared
159:08 - where
159:10 - okay let's say model let's make this as
159:13 - modal component
159:17 - and just export it here
159:21 - okay
159:23 - fine then import it here
159:26 - and save and no error will wear
159:28 - now I will trigger the model
159:30 - on click on the button so let me create
159:33 - one function here
159:36 - so it will be called uh
159:39 - just let me
159:41 - one second
159:43 - let me copy the state here from the
159:46 - model component
159:48 - which is this I mean cut it not copy
159:51 - this
159:53 - okay
159:56 - so
159:57 - let me cut the state from here
160:00 - paste it here import the state hook
160:06 - fine
160:07 - then let's say model open and set model
160:09 - open not one so we don't need second
160:12 - model
160:13 - and we don't need this either we need
160:16 - only one model
160:17 - so whenever we are clicking the button
160:19 - in this model
160:21 - it's opening this model
160:24 - so we have transferred this anglicument
160:26 - to this button
160:28 - so
160:29 - here I will set it as true
160:31 - like this then we can name the button
160:34 - from here
160:36 - now this model takes
160:37 - this open prop and the open value is
160:40 - modal to open but it's short model to
160:42 - open its model open so save this here
160:46 - also we don't need to
160:48 - do that so just we have to pass we don't
160:51 - need button or the state hook
160:53 - so we need to pass model open
160:56 - and set model open as props
160:59 - so first let me receive here
161:01 - receive it here
161:03 - Steve
161:05 - now let's pass them
161:07 - but let's also
161:09 - render the model component here
161:12 - that we are not rendering
161:13 - so we can render it out here
161:16 - like this then pass set model open and
161:19 - model open
161:20 - plus model open
161:23 - and set model open
161:29 - huh
161:30 - now let's see
161:32 - if you click the button let's see what
161:33 - happens so yes see this model is getting
161:36 - opened if we click cancel or OK this
161:39 - will be closed
161:41 - fine so now let's design the model
161:44 - so if you click this start a post you
161:47 - will see this text called create a post
161:50 - in the model
161:51 - so let me remove all the contents P tags
161:55 - and action H4 link and create a post
161:59 - here
162:02 - okay I think the title should be here
162:04 - vertically centered model dialogue
162:07 - so let me add it here
162:10 - and
162:11 - fine
162:13 - now
162:15 - what to do
162:17 - the next step is to write I mean create
162:19 - one input element
162:21 - so we can say input
162:24 - and the placeholder will be
162:28 - what
162:30 - do you want
162:33 - to
162:34 - talk about
162:36 - now save
162:38 - and we will see this input but we have
162:40 - to design this so we can say class name
162:45 - let's say model
162:48 - input
162:50 - now the class model input should be here
162:54 - and now let's Design This
162:58 - so first okay sorry this should be here
163:01 - first we don't see any background I mean
163:04 - we're sorry we don't see any border so
163:06 - make border has none for this input
163:09 - so if you do that we will have no water
163:11 - also background color will be white
163:16 - or white smoke
163:18 - so okay it's not white smoke I think
163:20 - it's pure white
163:23 - yes
163:24 - also it's breaking I mean we need some
163:28 - width but first outline
163:30 - also none
163:33 - so that it becomes simple as that
163:37 - color is black
163:41 - to see the post what we're writing
163:44 - font size
163:46 - 20 I mean it's not 2017 pixels let's try
163:50 - yes but it's big try 14 I think it's
163:54 - fine
163:55 - point
163:56 - family
163:58 - the name is system UI
164:03 - system
164:05 - UI
164:07 - contentment changed
164:09 - we can type
164:10 - find
164:12 - if you remove this entire thing we will
164:14 - see this placeholder Also let's add some
164:17 - width say 100 percent
164:20 - fine
164:21 - we have this width as well
164:23 - okay let's make the font size 16.
164:27 - fine
164:30 - you can write anything here like this
164:34 - okay
164:35 - we have also an emoji one image one
164:38 - video and this document button also we
164:41 - have this
164:43 - privacy
164:45 - select
164:47 - so we will add them later but first let
164:49 - me just post data to Firebase
164:52 - also we have a post button here
164:55 - so let's create it so save button
164:59 - class name
165:02 - post
165:03 - I mean modal
165:07 - button or BTN
165:09 - or say post BTN
165:11 - yes and it's called
165:14 - post now save this
165:17 - and it's here okay I think
165:19 - we can remove the button
165:22 - and
165:24 - just rename this okay
165:27 - to
165:28 - I mean rename this OK button
165:31 - to this post
165:32 - so let's check the documentation here
165:35 - customize button props
165:37 - yes let me check this
165:42 - okay
165:46 - on okay button okay I don't think this
165:48 - is what we need
165:52 - customize footer yes this is what we
165:54 - need
165:56 - so let me copy the footer
165:59 - which is an array
166:01 - for your object and in object we have
166:04 - array
166:05 - but it's not here it's here
166:08 - now we don't need this button or this
166:11 - button we can just add one post button
166:13 - here
166:14 - and Save
166:16 - Also let's import button from
166:19 - a and t design
166:22 - and save it loading is not defined
166:25 - where it is loading let me remove it
166:29 - fine and the look is not defined also
166:31 - remove it because we don't need them
166:33 - right now
166:35 - so we have the post button here that is
166:37 - doing the thing
166:39 - but it's disabled
166:41 - so we can make it disabled
166:45 - it becomes this color and if you hover
166:48 - the color I mean the button we won't see
166:51 - anything
166:52 - now if you type anything here this will
166:55 - be enabled so let me create one input
166:59 - element here
167:00 - so let me create it in this page
167:03 - not an input element but one state sorry
167:07 - so we can say
167:09 - let's say
167:11 - status
167:14 - comma set status
167:18 - equals to use State let's make it a
167:20 - string first just for just now pass the
167:24 - string to this set I mean pass the set
167:28 - status to this model
167:31 - now we don't need this for now come to
167:33 - model and get it as props
167:36 - now on this input we will have on change
167:43 - and we will store the data in set status
167:45 - like an event
167:47 - so we will have event
167:52 - dot Target
167:55 - dot value
167:58 - save this
167:59 - now if you type anything
168:02 - okay not here here
168:05 - the data is coming okay it's coming
168:08 - fine
168:10 - set status
168:12 - okay fine
168:14 - now now let me also pass the status here
168:20 - as prompts
168:22 - in the model component
168:24 - let's also get it here
168:26 - and here the value should be
168:30 - this status
168:33 - fine so we are going to disable
168:37 - this button
168:39 - when
168:40 - our input is empty
168:43 - I mean this input is empty if we fill it
168:45 - with something only then this button
168:48 - should be enabled
168:49 - so
168:50 - let me remove or not remove let's say if
168:54 - status dot length
168:58 - is more than 0
169:00 - it means something is inside this input
169:04 - so we will say
169:06 - um
169:07 - let's say false
169:09 - because if the status.lin is more than 0
169:13 - we want the disable to be false or if it
169:16 - is less than 0 or 0 we want it to be
169:19 - true
169:19 - save
169:21 - now let's try
169:22 - if you type anything
169:24 - the button will be enabled but if you
169:27 - remove anything this will be disabled
169:30 - so this is done
169:32 - so basically we have a model and where
169:36 - we can create our post
169:38 - now come to this post update
169:41 - and we have the status that contains our
169:45 - text that we need to save
169:47 - but we need one more thing one button
169:50 - not a button a function so say
169:52 - 10 status to Firebase
169:56 - so we will have this
169:58 - function
170:00 - let's pass it on the model as well
170:03 - like this come to model and just
170:08 - destructure it from props like this
170:11 - now we have sent status
170:14 - and on the button we have on we should
170:17 - have on click event
170:19 - and this should run this send status
170:22 - save
170:24 - and the UI is done for posting data
170:28 - fine
170:29 - now let's see the next step
170:31 - that is to send data to Firebase fire
170:34 - store
170:35 - firestore
170:36 - so to post data when we need a few apis
170:41 - I mean from Firebase
170:43 - so come over to this API file or folder
170:46 - then make a folder called let's say
170:51 - fire store
170:54 - apis
170:57 - yes it's a folder okay I think
171:00 - let's make a file not a folder
171:03 - sorry
171:04 - so let me delete this
171:06 - and create a file called firestore API
171:09 - dot Js
171:11 - but we need to initialize filed store
171:14 - so come over to Firebase firestore
171:18 - so to the strip I mean the step to do
171:21 - that is Authentication
171:23 - not all integration come to all products
171:26 - and choose Cloud firestore here
171:30 - to set it up we need to create the fire
171:32 - store instance so we can say import
171:36 - get fired store
171:44 - let me first or I mean add
171:47 - Firebase slash firestore
171:52 - fine then it will be easy to import the
171:54 - function
171:56 - get fired store
171:58 - now we need one more I mean constant so
172:01 - say const
172:02 - ore
172:05 - equals to get fire store
172:07 - that is this function and then we have
172:09 - to pass this app inside
172:13 - just like we have in Earth
172:15 - now we have to export the fire store
172:16 - variable
172:19 - like this
172:21 - so now we can close this
172:23 - come to the main.jsx file
172:25 - let's import
172:27 - okay we don't have to import it here but
172:30 - let's see okay let me create a database
172:32 - here
172:37 - let's start in test mode
172:40 - and click next
172:43 - okay let's choose enable I mean enable
172:45 - this
172:48 - fine
172:50 - for now what's the problem
172:54 - unknown error occurred let's also I mean
172:58 - click again
173:00 - let's see
173:05 - let's try Europe
173:08 - the location of the fire store
173:17 - um it's not working
173:20 - they create it again let's try
173:24 - okay it's created fine
173:28 - now come to rules
173:31 - because this has some security tools for
173:33 - example the person who is not logged in
173:36 - or signed in
173:38 - should not be able to write data or read
173:40 - them but
173:42 - we will just add it for now I mean we
173:45 - will just make it public for now
173:47 - let's click publish
173:53 - okay see this is saying that your rules
173:55 - are defined as public
173:57 - but we will change it later don't worry
173:59 - now
174:01 - all we need to do is
174:03 - create a function here so say export
174:06 - const let's say post
174:10 - status
174:13 - an error function this will be
174:17 - just like this file auth api.jsx we need
174:22 - to import a few things and the auth from
174:25 - Firebase firestorm but sorry not auth we
174:29 - will have fire store
174:31 - from Firebase config
174:33 - now
174:34 - so we are going to post data so we need
174:37 - this function from Firebase firestore
174:40 - so from let me add Firebase slash
174:43 - firestore
174:47 - so the first function is
174:49 - I think it's
174:52 - add doc
174:54 - add doc means add document
174:57 - also we need a collection keyword
175:01 - collection means a function that will be
175:04 - helpful to create a collection here
175:07 - fine
175:08 - so
175:10 - we have collection and add doc I think
175:13 - we also need
175:15 - one more thing called auth do we need
175:17 - Earth let me please check the
175:19 - documentation I am forgetting what is
175:21 - the thing that we need
175:23 - add dot Firebase
175:30 - okay so it's here add doc
175:33 - you are here import get fired store
175:36 - okay we are doing that collection in
175:38 - endoc okay
175:40 - const review that we are doing on this
175:43 - uh config file
175:45 - now we have to create a reference yes
175:49 - so let's create it so select
175:51 - dbrev
175:54 - equals to collection keyword that we had
175:57 - on the top it takes the DB I mean the DB
176:00 - is called the database in our case it's
176:03 - firestore
176:05 - then let's add the collection name so
176:07 - let's say
176:09 - posts
176:11 - save this now we have to use add doc
176:15 - here
176:16 - like this width
176:19 - and in the add dock we'll pass the dbrf
176:21 - if you scroll down we can see it here
176:25 - like add doc dbref the database ref and
176:28 - the data
176:29 - so we don't have the data so let me get
176:31 - it from the post data so
176:35 - okay we don't need model for now we need
176:39 - this also only auth API homecoming CSS
176:45 - wait
176:46 - the post status component
176:49 - so it is common post update and here yes
176:52 - we need this
176:53 - let me import this function here which
176:56 - is called post status
176:58 - so
177:00 - simply
177:01 - const
177:03 - okay
177:04 - yes import it at the top here okay cons
177:08 - post status
177:10 - from this
177:12 - API file
177:14 - then just add it here
177:17 - like this
177:18 - we will pass the status as RMS
177:22 - or arguments
177:24 - then this data will be here or say
177:27 - status
177:28 - fine let me create an object here so
177:31 - let's say let obj or let object
177:34 - which will be related to send
177:36 - so we will say status as status
177:39 - we are making an object because later we
177:41 - will add other items as well for example
177:44 - we have image video emoji and all also
177:48 - the privacy
177:49 - so let's add the object here after the
177:54 - daily ref
177:55 - now
177:56 - I think that's all but
177:59 - we need to then block here so say then
178:03 - and it will send us a response
178:06 - from Firebase
178:08 - and we can say console.log
178:12 - this document has been added
178:14 - successfully you can try this
178:16 - custom I'm in this message
178:19 - but
178:20 - if it fails we can catch it
178:23 - so why I'm using promise
178:25 - but here in auth API I was using try
178:29 - cache block
178:30 - and I think of it
178:32 - I mean not to think of it just try cash
178:33 - block but both will work
178:36 - so say error
178:39 - and second soul
178:41 - DOT log
178:46 - error
178:48 - now let's try this
178:51 - let me give okay we have problem here
178:55 - post status has been declared already
178:58 - where
179:00 - I guess here post status
179:03 - okay
179:04 - let me make the name of the post letters
179:08 - as small small p
179:11 - then
179:13 - change the Imports
179:15 - now it will work
179:17 - refresh it
179:19 - now open the
179:21 - console
179:24 - like this clear it click the button
179:26 - let's say hello
179:29 - world
179:31 - now click post
179:34 - and you will see document has been added
179:37 - successfully
179:38 - now check the fire store
179:45 - and we will see this posts I mean this
179:49 - posts is the database reference
179:53 - it takes a fire store from the auth I
179:56 - mean from the config file and the
179:58 - collection name so collection name is
180:00 - called posts
180:01 - and the status is called hello world
180:04 - fine
180:05 - so this is how we add data in Firebase
180:07 - firestore
180:08 - let's also do a few things I mean when
180:11 - we are sending data
180:13 - let's make the function as async
180:17 - a weight
180:19 - then once the function post status is
180:21 - done we will call set model open as
180:25 - false I will make it false to close it
180:30 - now save this
180:32 - let's say Hello World 2 click post and
180:36 - it's gone and immediately you will see
180:39 - we have status 2 as hello world 2 in the
180:42 - fire store
180:44 - fine
180:45 - but we also have to clear it
180:48 - so we can say
180:50 - uh of it
180:54 - thread status is empty
180:56 - now make it as hello world 3 click post
181:01 - and this will be here
181:05 - and if you click the button again
181:08 - you will not see the text that I posted
181:11 - that we typed before it's empty
181:15 - fine
181:16 - now one more thing to do let me
181:19 - have a toast here
181:22 - let me post I mean let me import
181:25 - toast from reactive I
181:28 - instead of the
181:30 - this log console log we can add toast
181:33 - dot success
181:35 - and let me try once more which will be
181:40 - let's say
181:41 - hello
181:43 - four
181:45 - type in type anything
181:47 - click post
181:48 - and we will see document has been added
181:51 - successfully
181:51 - and it will be here
181:54 - so that is how this is how we post
181:56 - status audit I mean we add data or
181:59 - document
182:00 - to the firestore
182:05 - now let's see how to get all the posts
182:07 - from firestore
182:09 - to come to the fire store api.jsx
182:13 - create a function called
182:16 - get posts
182:18 - all the posts
182:21 - basically it's an API yes
182:24 - so we will need a function from
182:26 - Firestone called get
182:28 - what do not get on Snapshot
182:32 - fine so we can call the function in this
182:35 - function it takes the difference which
182:37 - is called dbref
182:39 - comma then it provides the Callback so
182:42 - say data
182:44 - or set spawns not data
182:47 - fine
182:49 - then we have to filter our response from
182:52 - here so we can say
182:54 - console
182:57 - DOT log
182:59 - response
183:01 - dot data
183:04 - we are not data let's say Docs
183:09 - dot map
183:12 - the sponsor docs dot okay let me just
183:15 - show you how to do that
183:18 - but first we have to get the function
183:20 - here
183:21 - so export it sorry import it
183:24 - then we need one more hook called use
183:25 - memo hook
183:27 - from react
183:29 - then let me create the or add the hook
183:32 - here use memo
183:36 - then what we will do is in this use memo
183:39 - let's call this something called get
183:40 - posts
183:42 - fine now if you open the console let's
183:44 - say what we get
183:46 - what we have in the console
183:48 - so we have this thing called Excel
183:52 - so it's the data from the fired slot
183:54 - that we cannot trade right now we have
183:56 - to filter our data so we will choose the
183:57 - docs here
183:58 - if you see we haven't we have a docs
184:01 - object which contains our array
184:04 - so we can just response dot Docs
184:09 - and if you save we will see this array
184:12 - so we have to get the data from this
184:14 - error using map method
184:16 - we have to fill I mean yes we have to
184:18 - get the data using map
184:20 - we will create one more array from this
184:23 - array which will only contain our data
184:26 - that we need the posts
184:28 - in an object so let's say
184:32 - let's say Doc or Docs
184:37 - and let's return
184:41 - dogs
184:42 - Dot data as a function
184:46 - now I will get this array where we have
184:48 - all the statuses like Hello World to
184:52 - hello world hello world food and all
184:53 - like this
184:56 - also it provides us an ID I mean each of
184:59 - these statuses have an ID let me go to
185:02 - console in firestore
185:04 - so you see this ID called atfq and all
185:07 - it's an ID that we can also get so we
185:10 - can just make Docs
185:13 - dot ID
185:15 - if you save we will have
185:17 - this array with the ID as well inside it
185:19 - for each of the posts I mean status
185:24 - one second let's make this as note posts
185:27 - get status
185:29 - okay now here also we have to change get
185:32 - status
185:33 - fine but the thing is we don't need the
185:36 - data here we need it in this component
185:39 - so let me create a state here called
185:42 - uh all status
185:46 - and set all letters
185:51 - used it
185:52 - and Eric
185:54 - so let's pass this get status in this
185:57 - function
185:59 - get status
186:01 - I mean we have to pass
186:03 - this function set all status inside get
186:06 - status yes that's what I'm saying
186:09 - now let's get it here
186:11 - so we can set it here directly if you
186:13 - save and refresh the page
186:16 - okay let's cancel that log this all
186:18 - statuses
186:19 - here
186:21 - and see the output
186:23 - so we will get this array of four
186:25 - objects
186:26 - if you refresh
186:29 - it's empty but then we get it after some
186:31 - time
186:32 - so it takes a few minutes 40 minutes
186:34 - minutes of your milliseconds to load
186:37 - so if you check networks tab
186:40 - go to fetch xhr refresh the page
186:43 - and it takes some moment to fetch the
186:46 - data
186:47 - fine so we have our order that we can
186:49 - add later not now
186:51 - so we have this what is it the state
186:54 - called
186:56 - state is all statuses
186:59 - now let me remove this console log
187:01 - so that we can map the
187:04 - array here so we can see all set says
187:07 - dot map
187:09 - let's say status
187:17 - I don't know why I named this as status
187:19 - it should be
187:21 - posts
187:23 - wait a second post status you get status
187:26 - fine it's fine
187:27 - now we have to return
187:30 - a div or a fragment but I prefer
187:33 - fragment
187:34 - but you can also use it but the problem
187:37 - is both refer in some cases like each
187:40 - have their use cases
187:42 - the react fragment or div
187:45 - so in this fragment let me return one h
187:50 - let's say not H3 A P tag simply and send
187:54 - status Dot
187:56 - what is the key name
187:59 - status
188:01 - so it's odd so let's make it as posts so
188:04 - that
188:05 - we can have posts dot status
188:09 - save the file
188:11 - but the problem is we're getting it here
188:13 - and that is the problem that I warned
188:15 - you about
188:16 - so we have to wrap this in one more div
188:19 - so that it becomes the child of this
188:21 - four states Main
188:23 - but I don't think it will work fine but
188:26 - it works
188:27 - so
188:29 - fine let me get the class here post
188:32 - status Main
188:33 - they should be in index.js CSS
188:36 - and we have to make Flex direction as
188:39 - column
188:41 - now it's fine we can say it
188:45 - now let me show you this if I add one
188:48 - more post let's say hello
188:50 - World pipe and click post
188:54 - it will be immediately here immediately
188:58 - and here also
189:00 - that is the use of this on Snapshot
189:04 - let me close this
189:05 - now let me grab one component here for
189:08 - the card that is on LinkedIn for example
189:10 - this card
189:12 - so
189:13 - we need one component here called let's
189:16 - say posts
189:19 - God
189:21 - in this let's have an index file
189:27 - and one fcss so index.scss
189:31 - so make it a function component
189:35 - but let's change the name to
189:37 - posts
189:39 - card here as well
189:42 - for now
189:43 - we will have this
189:45 - uh
189:46 - text here now let me import the SAS SSS
189:49 - component
189:52 - which is post on one step back index dot
189:57 - scss now save
189:59 - now we can close the firestore API or
190:03 - model CSS let's get the component of the
190:06 - postcard I mean posts card here
190:10 - so import
190:15 - posts card
190:17 - from Posts card
190:20 - and let me just
190:23 - returned this component
190:26 - like this
190:28 - so we'll see five posts card text here
190:30 - because this component
190:33 - is running five times
190:35 - we have to pass this posts as
190:39 - um prop
190:42 - yes
190:43 - now let's receive the prop here
190:45 - I'm going to structure it then in here
190:48 - we can write our
190:50 - these things like posts so in this step
190:55 - Let's Make A P tag which will be called
190:58 - as
191:01 - posts dot status
191:05 - now you will see the same thing if I
191:08 - refresh and it's it works
191:12 - now what to do we have the card but it's
191:15 - very basic
191:17 - I mean it's not a card yet but it's very
191:19 - basic so give this div a class name of
191:22 - posts card
191:24 - now let's copy the class come over to
191:27 - index.css
191:28 - and add it here
191:30 - now in this class let's create a card
191:33 - here like this
191:34 - so we can use same styling as this card
191:37 - so let's get it from this what is it try
191:42 - home component no I think it's in post
191:46 - status
191:48 - where it is
191:52 - component common post update
191:55 - yes from here
191:57 - so
191:58 - we have this
192:00 - post status card
192:03 - no this is the card
192:05 - wait a second
192:07 - which card do we have
192:09 - this card post status
192:11 - yes let's search it here
192:14 - and let me get all of these item from
192:18 - here
192:19 - and simply paste it here
192:22 - in the postcard.scss
192:26 - now we will get these cards but they are
192:28 - very very small
192:31 - so we have to make them large
192:34 - fine so we can make the mid width to 100
192:38 - percent
192:39 - still it's very short
192:42 - okay let's remove wait a second
192:45 - come over here
192:48 - okay let's close this
192:50 - this as well
192:52 - so I'm fine so let's make this as
192:55 - 300 pixels
192:57 - or
192:59 - 500
193:00 - or 600 or 550.
193:06 - yes they are not perfect
193:09 - let's do the same thing in that
193:11 - component as well let's don't let's not
193:14 - do its use percentage
193:16 - so if we are on a bigger screen
193:19 - this will be response
193:22 - fine so what about the model
193:25 - yes model is fine
193:27 - so we have this all the cards data here
193:31 - let me lose this one
193:33 - now we have this text but the placement
193:36 - of the text
193:38 - is different
193:40 - so it starts from the left
193:42 - so give this Diva I mean pay a class
193:45 - name of
193:46 - status
193:49 - and let's say status
193:52 - or the status or yes
193:55 - so in here say status
193:58 - extra line
193:59 - left
194:04 - it's not on the left
194:07 - so I guess why
194:09 - we can remove I think
194:11 - this item just have a Content Center
194:13 - now it's on us and it's on the left
194:16 - so it's having some padding so let's add
194:20 - the padding here
194:23 - 20 pixels
194:26 - now it's it has some padding
194:29 - but the width of this card has increased
194:32 - so basically we can add padding here as
194:35 - well now the inner element is now
194:37 - shifted to Insider
194:39 - now also
194:41 - we have the font size smaller and the
194:45 - font is different so let's also check
194:48 - that the font is system UI
194:50 - so let's make it here font
194:55 - uh font font font family
195:00 - y
195:02 - is it changed
195:06 - yes I guess so and now what is it the
195:10 - size is 14px
195:11 - the font size for 10 pixels
195:15 - now it's small
195:17 - also font family font weight 400 so font
195:21 - weight
195:22 - 400 pixels not pixels fortnite
195:29 - also the color is this so let's see in
195:32 - the color here
195:34 - so make the color
195:37 - as this
195:39 - now we have this
195:40 - but something still feels wrong here
195:44 - Earth system UI
195:47 - but I don't know what's the problem here
195:50 - let's search
195:51 - the correct font
195:54 - okay gets I guess it is working
195:57 - whatever you copy this font
196:02 - paste it here
196:06 - oh okay
196:08 - fine I think it's fine it's fine it's
196:11 - fine
196:12 - okay
196:13 - now I have this card
196:14 - fine
196:16 - now
196:18 - we can even move it to the top
196:21 - or leave it here
196:22 - fine but we also need a few things here
196:25 - for example the username
196:28 - we have this timestamp six hours ago and
196:31 - on so now let's create the timestamp
196:34 - here
196:35 - in the post update.jsx
196:38 - and for the timestamp let's have a
196:42 - let's have a
196:44 - Library called moment.js
196:47 - so let me install it in the direct app
196:51 - so let me copy this command
196:54 - and install it
196:57 - using the terminal
197:01 - save
197:02 - now all we have to do is import
197:04 - moment.js
197:06 - let me create one helper function for
197:07 - this
197:09 - so
197:10 - let's create it here in the or not in
197:14 - any file
197:15 - say in this helper CS so say use moment
197:22 - dot jsx basically it's a hook
197:25 - so export
197:28 - const
197:29 - dates
197:31 - or let's say
197:32 - change or get date or get current date
197:38 - or say time
197:45 - it's a function but we need moment
197:48 - package here so we can import
197:50 - moment from moment
197:52 - then it will take a date that
197:56 - okay not the date
197:58 - okay
197:59 - let's say moment
198:04 - I mean let's choose one time stamp here
198:08 - which is
198:09 - let's try
198:13 - let's try
198:15 - um see
198:17 - let's try this one
198:21 - to add it here
198:23 - so it will
198:25 - take the current time and it will format
198:28 - it using this Triple L and this will be
198:31 - the output for this so we have to return
198:32 - it
198:35 - but we can get this Triple L from the
198:38 - param circle so say
198:40 - format
198:41 - or
198:43 - time format
198:46 - then we have to just pass it here
198:48 - and now let me call this function get
198:51 - time stamp
198:52 - in our post
198:55 - update.jsx so import
198:59 - what is the name
199:01 - get current
199:04 - timestamp from this route
199:07 - and
199:09 - then what we have to do is
199:12 - let's say okay
199:15 - post status we have here
199:19 - one second
199:22 - okay now let me pass or wait a second I
199:24 - think the update is not happening here
199:27 - so
199:29 - tell status is here
199:33 - a wait post status
199:35 - what is wait a second
199:38 - set panel option I forgot the code how
199:42 - it was working
199:43 - let me open the model and check
199:46 - no it's not happening here either
199:48 - so where it is happening
199:50 - so I guess it's happening in the home
199:52 - component
199:53 - no here also no
199:55 - so where are we calling that function
199:59 - today is my bad day I guess
200:02 - so I think this is the function that we
200:05 - are having
200:06 - and here we are passing the status
200:10 - okay
200:11 - fine is this all
200:15 - if we click Start a post
200:17 - this model will open and we have the
200:20 - send status that we are passing this fun
200:22 - and this component called modal
200:24 - component
200:25 - I think that's it post status yes
200:30 - so let me create one object so say obj
200:34 - or object equals to an object
200:36 - here we will have status as status
200:40 - comma
200:43 - then we have
200:45 - uh what is it then say timestamp
200:50 - equals to
200:52 - okay let me import it here as well only
200:55 - we read it here
200:57 - so get current timestamp and let's pass
201:00 - Triple L
201:02 - in capital
201:04 - so we can try to control this as well
201:07 - so concern.log this
201:10 - now open the console
201:12 - and let's see what we are getting
201:17 - we are getting nothing
201:19 - so we are returning this data
201:22 - Let me refresh the page once
201:26 - I guess it's still compiling
201:28 - so
201:29 - let's open the
201:31 - terminal terminal
201:35 - yes it's compiling and it will say it
201:38 - will take some time because this weight
201:40 - also
201:41 - modifies or optimizes dependencies
201:45 - yes see we're reading the data which is
201:48 - the current date and the time
201:51 - for now
201:52 - we are passing this here as Triple L
201:55 - format
201:57 - then let's pass this object in the post
202:00 - status here
202:01 - to open post status in the
202:04 - API
202:06 - in flyers for dpa.jsx let me remove the
202:09 - object and say object here that we are
202:12 - getting and simply pass it here this
202:15 - will work as well
202:16 - we can remove the console log for this
202:19 - now let's try
202:21 - Let me refresh
202:23 - let me delete the entire posts
202:26 - I'm in the collection
202:30 - but wait let's also add one more thing
202:33 - one last thing here which will be the
202:36 - current email
202:37 - of the user so the user is logged in
202:41 - and let's store his credentials
202:45 - in
202:47 - let's store his credentials in local
202:49 - storage
202:51 - okay so we can do that from login API
202:55 - so it takes I mean it Returns the
202:57 - response and made the login API that we
203:00 - are calling let's check
203:03 - here
203:04 - so it sends us a response
203:08 - so we can simply console.log this
203:11 - response like this
203:13 - but we need to be logged out for this
203:15 - because we can't see this login response
203:18 - here for now
203:20 - so how to log out let me delete all the
203:22 - users from here and start again
203:24 - from Chris from scratch
203:27 - so
203:28 - delete this
203:31 - Let me refresh the page and see what
203:33 - happens
203:35 - okay nothing happens let me delete the
203:38 - other two
203:42 - we haven't made the logout button yet
203:46 - yes we have on this login page now let
203:49 - me create one account here
203:52 - using our email or phone so sign
203:55 - I mean join now
203:57 - let me create
203:59 - one minute so if I if you are creating
204:03 - the account
204:04 - they should be in the registered
204:05 - component as well
204:07 - to set it in the
204:09 - local storage I mean we have to make the
204:12 - console log
204:14 - so we can set spawns
204:16 - dot email
204:19 - or I guess let's check
204:22 - so
204:24 - let's say nishanth s440 at the rate
204:29 - Gmail
204:31 - .com some password let's type
204:35 - and again join
204:39 - so account created
204:41 - okay but okay we hadn't saved it yet
204:43 - fine
204:45 - that was the problem so okay we can do
204:48 - one thing
204:49 - we can remove
204:51 - the
204:53 - we can remove this thing
204:55 - the Earth
204:57 - I mean not the auth where it is it
205:00 - yes we can remove
205:02 - where is it where is it in the home
205:06 - component
205:08 - origin sorry not the component in the
205:10 - home page
205:11 - so we can simply comment out this for
205:14 - now
205:16 - and from here
205:19 - from this page called login.jsx also
205:22 - comment it out
205:24 - let's make the use I mean the loading to
205:27 - false
205:29 - and in this home as well so that we can
205:32 - see our range
205:33 - so let me go to the login page now
205:37 - okay not the login page yes login page
205:39 - will work quite as well so let me add
205:41 - the email that we use now
205:45 - gmail.com
205:47 - the password
205:50 - click sign in
205:52 - we will see all is retired so we can use
205:55 - in the login page
205:57 - where is our login component
206:00 - okay let me see login login component
206:06 - there are too much files here
206:08 - yes so res
206:12 - dot user
206:14 - and then in the user we have this email
206:19 - so let's store this thing in the local
206:22 - storage
206:23 - so we can say
206:25 - local storage.set item
206:31 - it will be user email
206:34 - the same thing we can do here in the
206:38 - registered component
206:40 - so we can do it here not the console log
206:43 - fine
206:44 - now let me divide back the changes we
206:46 - did in this two components here
206:50 - okay so come over to this home.jsx and
206:54 - revert everything back to the state it
206:56 - was before
206:57 - login as well
206:59 - now save
207:01 - let me expand it a little bit less
207:03 - fine
207:04 - now
207:06 - let's try from the beginning let me
207:08 - delete all the users here
207:10 - I mean only one user we have we can
207:12 - delete that
207:14 - fine
207:16 - we don't need login page or the home
207:18 - page
207:19 - okay
207:21 - so let me use I mean let me create one
207:24 - user here
207:25 - again
207:27 - so join now
207:28 - email our phone let me open this thing
207:32 - which is the applications tab
207:35 - in the applications tab we have local
207:36 - storage and it's empty for this so we
207:39 - can say Nishan there's 440
207:43 - at the rate
207:44 - gmail.com
207:47 - and the password
207:50 - click again join
207:52 - and now we have this email here user
207:55 - email
207:56 - for the current user
207:58 - so I prefer I mean we have to use the
208:02 - local storage non-positional storage
208:03 - because session will be destroyed after
208:07 - some time or even or when we close the
208:10 - tab or when we close the browser
208:13 - now here we can just get the
208:16 - email from the user so let
208:18 - user email
208:20 - equals to local storage
208:23 - dot get item
208:26 - the user email key that we typed here so
208:30 - we don't need this either
208:32 - okay save this and save the user email
208:36 - as user email
208:39 - now
208:40 - we have no data here
208:42 - so open the fire database
208:45 - no data is here
208:47 - fine let's try to save one
208:49 - so we can say hello
208:52 - World click post
208:54 - and it's here
208:57 - then if you check here let me refresh
209:02 - we will see
209:03 - all these three items called status
209:05 - timestamp and the email
209:07 - I hope so
209:09 - yes it's here
209:11 - fine
209:12 - now what we have to do is
209:14 - let me just render it out here simply in
209:18 - the
209:19 - postcard
209:21 - so
209:23 - after I mean before this let's add one P
209:25 - tag and say
209:28 - posts Dot what is the key name times
209:32 - temp
209:34 - timestamp yes
209:39 - timestamp
209:43 - so we will have timestamp here then we
209:45 - have the email as well
209:46 - so
209:48 - okay let's not show the email for now
209:50 - because the use of email is very
209:53 - different here
209:55 - not to show it here
209:57 - so give this timestamp a class of time
210:01 - stamp
210:02 - let me come to
210:04 - the CSS for this or scss and add the
210:09 - class here which will be
210:12 - timestamp is this so let me hover this
210:15 - font
210:16 - six hours
210:18 - the same is here system UI
210:21 - porn family
210:23 - font size 12 pixels
210:27 - okay colored is
210:29 - this
210:31 - so color
210:33 - is this Pond weight 400
210:37 - what else do we have
210:39 - nothing
210:40 - so I save this and the timestamp will be
210:43 - here but they're not arranged Also let's
210:46 - add padding 20 pixels for this
210:49 - so they are not arranged properly as it
210:52 - should be
210:53 - I mean as they should be so we can say
210:55 - justify for you not justify Flex
210:58 - reduction column
211:00 - now there will be a column
211:03 - so I guess the problem is the height
211:05 - here
211:06 - or is the it is it the height
211:09 - let's try justify content Center
211:12 - yes now they are fine
211:14 - but still the Gap is too much between
211:17 - them
211:18 - so I guess what's the problem let's
211:20 - remove the height and try
211:22 - okay it's it is not like this
211:25 - okay okay okay what can we do
211:30 - display Flex all the things let me
211:32 - comment this for now
211:34 - so it comes at the start
211:38 - fine
211:39 - but we have to bring it down
211:43 - okay I guess we don't need align items
211:45 - then it will work
211:46 - yes but still
211:49 - let me move
211:51 - or just remove this also and see what
211:53 - happens okay it's not fine
211:56 - okay what if we remove this and remove
211:59 - the padding here as well
212:02 - okay
212:04 - if you are having removing the padding
212:06 - let's add margin 10 pixels
212:09 - where margin is fine
212:11 - add it here as well tied 20
212:15 - okay
212:16 - so we can do this so margin
212:19 - 10 okay just make it as zero zero zero
212:22 - zero
212:23 - fine
212:24 - if you had 10 here or 10 pixels
212:27 - this will be moved from Top
212:30 - I mean its top margin
212:32 - then this is called
212:36 - bottom margin I'm in top bottom I guess
212:38 - this is called left
212:41 - okay not left
212:42 - this is left
212:44 - 10 pixels yes the timestamp is here and
212:48 - the status
212:49 - fine the same thing we can apply here
212:52 - not just margin 10 pixels
212:55 - and it will work the fine I mean it work
212:58 - it will work
212:59 - fine
213:02 - so the timestamp is here and the hello
213:05 - world text
213:07 - all we need to do is now is to add the
213:09 - username
213:11 - and the image that will be for the next
213:14 - I mean very next part
213:17 - because we will need fire explode
213:19 - Firebase storage for this
213:22 - fine
213:24 - now in the next in the next video
213:26 - let's do
213:28 - the profile page for the current user
213:32 - so we'll have to fill the data in the
213:34 - profile
213:36 - so that we will do in the next video
213:38 - let me also start add one more post call
213:42 - hello world 2.
213:45 - click post and it will be here
213:48 - immediately and the timestamp also
213:51 - if you check both status is here now
213:55 - like this
213:56 - so this is not the final version of this
213:59 - home posts card we will add all of these
214:02 - things
214:03 - fine let me copy this post and just add
214:06 - it here and see what happens
214:10 - click post
214:13 - okay the problem is
214:15 - we have to add the height as Auto
214:19 - okay not the auto I mean let's add Min
214:22 - height as 120 pixels
214:24 - or maybe
214:26 - let's say
214:29 - okay if the post is small then we see I
214:33 - mean if the post is large we see the C
214:35 - more button
214:37 - so I guess
214:38 - we can make this as Auto and see what
214:40 - happens
214:43 - or 120 pixels
214:46 - let's make it as
214:48 - let's leave it a lotto and add one
214:51 - padding bottom
214:54 - to 20 pixels
214:56 - now we have this and it looks much
214:58 - better than before
214:59 - so this is how we created
215:02 - the
215:04 - posts card that contain or that will
215:08 - contain our posts
215:09 - fine then okay
215:15 - now let's see a few things that we can
215:18 - do before the profile page creation
215:21 - and first of all the first thing is we
215:24 - need to create a pop-up here
215:26 - if you click this profile icon we should
215:29 - see a pop-up and it contains the logout
215:31 - button or item
215:33 - if we click this button of logout
215:36 - we need to run the logout function and
215:38 - log out of the system
215:40 - so let's create the API for that
215:43 - in this API OS API let me have function
215:46 - called
215:47 - export
215:51 - cons on
215:52 - logout
215:56 - and in this function
215:58 - we will call a method call okay just let
216:01 - me have dry catch block first
216:03 - and remove all of these items
216:07 - so the method name is sign out from fire
216:10 - space
216:13 - sign out
216:14 - sign out
216:15 - now we need to use the function here and
216:18 - just pass the auth and that's all
216:22 - now we have to call the function here so
216:24 - let's call it
216:27 - so import
216:28 - what is it on
216:31 - log out
216:33 - from this route
216:35 - and just wrap this function in this
216:38 - button I mean add it here like this
216:41 - now if you click logout button we should
216:43 - be on the home page I mean not the home
216:45 - page on the login page see we are on
216:50 - this page
216:51 - file so it works
216:53 - now the next change we have to do is in
216:56 - this page called join now I'm in the
216:58 - registered page
217:00 - so come over to components register
217:02 - component
217:04 - and here let's make the login as
217:07 - register
217:10 - and add the function here as well on the
217:12 - button of the on button only I mean
217:16 - now what we need to do is we need to add
217:19 - one more field here for the name of the
217:22 - user so let's add it here
217:24 - and that will be
217:27 - your name there so the type will be of
217:30 - text
217:32 - and the name I mean the key will be of
217:34 - name
217:35 - and we will have this here
217:37 - so let's also store the name in the fire
217:40 - store
217:41 - okay what I am saying okay not that
217:45 - I mean what we need to do is we need to
217:47 - store all the items I mean the email and
217:49 - the name in the fire store
217:52 - to get the current user after filtering
217:55 - so I will show you I mean I will tell
217:57 - you what I mean with firestore DPI let's
218:01 - have
218:02 - this okay
218:04 - what is this what is this
218:07 - let me remove this I think I was trying
218:10 - okay
218:16 - what happened
218:20 - something is wrong
218:23 - if you save wait a second wait a second
218:26 - wait a second
218:27 - let me go to the top and remove this yes
218:30 - now it will work fine
218:32 - now
218:34 - fine
218:35 - so now we need to store the data in the
218:38 - fire store for that when one reference
218:41 - call user f
218:42 - and the collection name is called or
218:44 - cooperatively called as users so this
218:47 - will contain all our users when we sign
218:49 - up
218:50 - so what I mean by that
218:53 - so let me
218:55 - add a function here called export
218:58 - post user
219:00 - data
219:03 - like this
219:05 - in this let's create one
219:08 - okay we already have the function here
219:10 - fine
219:11 - so it takes an object
219:14 - and
219:15 - loads the data in the Pirate Store
219:19 - collection
219:20 - so
219:22 - we are passing the user F here
219:24 - and the object is already here so we
219:26 - have to call this function directly post
219:28 - user data
219:30 - so we don't need this we need to call it
219:32 - here
219:33 - so
219:34 - we'll just let me call it like this
219:37 - import
219:38 - post user data
219:40 - and we need to run the function here in
219:43 - this drive Block in the register
219:45 - function
219:47 - post user data
219:49 - and you will pass credentials
219:53 - dot email one second what is that we are
219:56 - passing
219:57 - okay let's pass
220:00 - the credentials
220:04 - here
220:05 - here
220:07 - or
220:10 - let's second I guess
220:13 - okay we can make it as an object as well
220:15 - so we can just say name will be of
220:18 - credential dot name
220:20 - comma
220:21 - email will be off
220:25 - credentials dot email
220:28 - now save this and whenever this function
220:30 - gets called
220:32 - the datability passed here and stored
220:35 - inside firestore
220:36 - now let's try this
220:39 - so we need to delete our
220:41 - uh
220:43 - user from here then try again
220:47 - now let me also delete the
220:50 - database collection which is called
220:53 - posts so just delete collection
220:56 - here
221:00 - now let's try let me enter my name
221:02 - called Nishant
221:04 - Kumar
221:05 - let me add my email correlation that's
221:07 - 440 at the rate
221:09 - gmail.com and the password
221:14 - once again
221:16 - click again join
221:19 - and we are signed in
221:21 - fine and now if you refresh the filed
221:24 - store
221:25 - you will see this thing
221:28 - I mean this current user here
221:32 - so
221:34 - let's see the user is here with email
221:36 - and name
221:37 - fine
221:38 - as you already know we are storing our
221:41 - email in the local storage as well so we
221:44 - need to create a more function
221:46 - to get this data and filter it to get
221:49 - the current name of the user and the
221:51 - email
221:53 - so we can export const get current
222:00 - user
222:02 - and
222:03 - just say
222:05 - what can we say
222:08 - so we need to use this on Snapshot which
222:12 - is here
222:13 - fine let me add it here but instead of
222:16 - this posts ref we need to pass user's
222:20 - ref or use the ref
222:22 - let me just console this for now here
222:26 - and Save
222:28 - now
222:30 - if you check let me call the function
222:32 - here let me call the function in the
222:34 - home component
222:35 - or in the home page so in the home page
222:39 - we have this as here
222:41 - okay let's call this in this page or
222:44 - better in the layout
222:46 - home.jsx
222:48 - so that we can pass it in home in the
222:50 - top bar to have the name as well for the
222:53 - current user so we can say import
222:55 - uh get
222:57 - current user
223:00 - let me create one memo hook here use
223:02 - memo
223:04 - use memo
223:06 - and just add use memo
223:12 - and just call this get current user here
223:17 - now let's say the console what we are
223:19 - getting
223:23 - so we are getting
223:26 - this error of object which is contained
223:28 - which contains email name and ID
223:31 - fine so I guess we don't need it so we
223:33 - can remove it
223:34 - we just need these two items
223:37 - fine
223:38 - or let's leave the ID and make this as
223:41 - user ID
223:43 - so that we can have user ID here
223:45 - what is current user
223:48 - fine now we need to filter the current
223:51 - user
223:52 - that we are on currently for example let
223:55 - me log out and login with my other
223:57 - account I may log sign out and not sign
224:01 - out
224:02 - okay I am tired so I mean
224:05 - let me register with my other account so
224:08 - send me Shan only and this
224:13 - Nishant
224:16 - s550123 at the rate
224:18 - gmail.com password
224:22 - click again join
224:25 - so we have one more
224:27 - database I mean user here which is this
224:31 - now if you check the console here we
224:34 - will get two users
224:36 - see
224:38 - in this area of objects
224:41 - this we're having two users let me give
224:43 - it a refresh and try again
224:46 - let me have some water first I am
224:49 - feeling tired
224:56 - we are having two wizards
224:58 - but we're going to get the current user
225:00 - that we are on currently which is this
225:02 - email Nishan that's 550123 at gmail.com
225:06 - so to do that
225:08 - we can use our local storage to get the
225:11 - current user from here the current email
225:13 - so let's say let
225:15 - curve email
225:17 - equals local storage dot get item
225:21 - and the key name which is user email I
225:24 - think
225:25 - now we have this correct email
225:27 - then we can filter this here so just see
225:30 - Dot
225:31 - filter
225:34 - let's say item
225:36 - and
225:37 - we can return
225:40 - item dot key name what is
225:43 - we have here we have a email as email so
225:46 - email
225:47 - equals to current email
225:50 - now we will get the only one email
225:52 - that we are on currently which is this
225:55 - so to access
225:57 - the first element I mean the only limit
225:59 - that we have make it as zero index or
226:02 - zeroth index
226:04 - and we will have this like this
226:06 - now in the home layout let me create a
226:09 - state here so const let's say current
226:12 - user
226:14 - that current user
226:18 - equals to use state
226:22 - empty object
226:25 - now path this Set current user here
226:29 - get it here
226:30 - and simply store it here
226:32 - like this
226:34 - now we have to pass this current user to
226:37 - the home page or home PS home page
226:42 - now come to the home page where is it
226:45 - here in the pages folder
226:48 - then let's get it here
226:51 - now pass it further to this home
226:53 - component
226:55 - and we will keep passing it
226:58 - so let me get to this component home
227:01 - component
227:03 - get it as props then pass it even
227:05 - further
227:08 - like this
227:10 - fine now come to the post status
227:13 - component
227:15 - this is post update yes this one let me
227:21 - just
227:22 - add it here post
227:25 - do we have current user here
227:27 - fine
227:28 - now when we are setting the data or
227:30 - sending the data to firestore we need to
227:33 - also add the user
227:35 - name
227:37 - which will be current user dot name
227:41 - Also let's add the post ID I mean post
227:44 - ID
227:45 - that is the idea of the current post
227:47 - that we are posting
227:49 - so we can add some random ID
227:52 - so we can use the package called uid in
227:56 - react I think let's try this
227:58 - so let me install the package
228:02 - View
228:04 - terminal add one more and install it now
228:08 - we have to import this at the top or let
228:12 - me create a function helper function for
228:14 - this as well
228:15 - so let's say
228:18 - get
228:19 - unique
228:22 - ID Dot jsx
228:25 - we need to create a function here which
228:27 - is called git ID or even better we can
228:30 - change it to get unique ID
228:33 - and we will export the function in the
228:35 - function we will have ID
228:37 - and we will return the ID so ideal
228:40 - contain the current ID from uid
228:43 - from this library then we can simply
228:46 - import the function here
228:48 - in this component
228:50 - and
228:52 - consolid to check the current ID we're
228:54 - getting here
228:55 - now we need to get the ID from here to
228:59 - this post ID for the current post so let
229:02 - me remove comment
229:04 - and create unique ID
229:06 - now all of this data will be sent to
229:08 - fired store
229:10 - here
229:11 - so let me open okay we don't have the
229:13 - collection for this for posts but let me
229:17 - try let me create a
229:18 - post call
229:20 - this is Nishant
229:23 - now click post and this will be here
229:25 - with a timestamp
229:27 - and if you refresh this page this
229:30 - filesport console you will get the
229:32 - current post that we did now
229:35 - so it will be in posts
229:39 - and we will have this
229:41 - fine so why I did that is because this
229:45 - contains our email
229:47 - fine and if we create a profile page we
229:51 - should be able to filter the
229:54 - posts based on the current user that
229:57 - signed what I mean that signed that
229:59 - signed in yes now we can do one more
230:02 - thing
230:04 - so where are we reading the data so let
230:07 - me check the component
230:08 - close all the components that we don't
230:10 - need
230:11 - fine
230:12 - so where does it
230:14 - it is here
230:17 - so where is it I think in the login
230:19 - component
230:21 - in the posts card I guess no not here
230:24 - post update component let's check here
230:27 - yes we have all the okay it's in the
230:30 - postcards itself
230:32 - okay
230:34 - here fine so also let me add the name so
230:38 - if you see
230:39 - we have this name here called Abhishek
230:42 - patil I mean for example
230:44 - so before this time stamp
230:48 - let's add the name called p
230:51 - and this will be called
230:52 - posts dot name
230:56 - now save this and let's see the name
231:03 - so add it here
231:05 - and we should be see we should see the
231:07 - name here called nishanth
231:10 - fine let's style it a little bit so
231:12 - class name will be name
231:15 - we don't need this component or this
231:16 - component just come over to the styling
231:19 - file
231:21 - SSS file
231:22 - and let me add a name class name here
231:26 - so
231:28 - the things here are same I mean there
231:32 - are they're all equal
231:33 - but the name is a little bit Bolder so
231:36 - we can just copy all our items here
231:38 - and add it let's make the font size for
231:42 - 10 pixels
231:43 - and
231:45 - make the font with a 600. now it's
231:48 - bolder
231:49 - but it's sticking to this time stamp
231:53 - like this
231:55 - point so we can add it
231:58 - so where is it the time let me add or
232:01 - let me have margin or remove margin top
232:04 - as 10. now we have this Nishant as name
232:08 - and the timestamp fine
232:10 - now let me log out and create one more
232:14 - account for the other email from the
232:17 - email called let's say Nishant
232:19 - Kumar will be the name here email
232:24 - test this
232:26 - and some password
232:30 - click again join
232:32 - you cannot create your account but why
232:36 - let me open the Netflix tab
232:38 - and check
232:40 - again join
232:42 - okay I think email already exists
232:46 - do we have the email here
232:49 - yes okay I guess I have to login only
232:51 - not sign in
232:54 - so let me sign in with this email okay
232:58 - what is the name of the current okay
233:00 - it's Nishant Kumar fine
233:01 - in let's do this
233:04 - now let's
233:05 - add one more account I mean one more
233:07 - post from here called
233:09 - hello this is Nishan
233:13 - Kumar
233:14 - now click post
233:16 - the name is still the Nishant not Kumar
233:20 - okay what is the problem here
233:22 - so the problem was this let me show you
233:25 - what I mean
233:26 - so basically we were just adding a
233:28 - variable here and we were storing the
233:31 - local storage email in the variable then
233:34 - maybe adding the variable here but now
233:36 - we're doing it directly
233:38 - fine and in the post update we need to
233:42 - store the current user dot email here
233:44 - not the other way around
233:46 - so that was the fix now if you log in
233:50 - let me log in with this email called
233:52 - nishanth s440 at the red Gmail
233:58 - .com so the username of this email is
234:02 - Nishant Kumar
234:03 - so let me add one update from here
234:06 - called
234:07 - hello
234:08 - okay
234:09 - which will be hello
234:12 - this
234:14 - is this is Nishant
234:17 - Kumar if you click a post
234:20 - you will see Nishan Kumar and hello this
234:23 - is Nishant Kumar and now if you log in
234:25 - with the other account
234:27 - which is Nishant
234:31 - s550123 at the red gmail.com one two
234:36 - three four five six seven
234:38 - now we will add
234:40 - here hello
234:44 - this is Nishant
234:46 - and only Nishan not Kumar click post
234:50 - and we will see hello this is Nishant
234:53 - and the username is called nishanth so
234:56 - that's how we fixed it using these items
235:02 - now let's work on the profile page
235:05 - first we have this layout which is
235:08 - called profile layout the same way we
235:10 - have the home layout
235:12 - in the layout I mean profile layout we
235:14 - are having the profile page
235:16 - in the profile page we are having the
235:18 - profile component this component in the
235:21 - profile component we are having the
235:23 - profile card which is simple just a card
235:26 - here and The Styling is this note it
235:29 - down and you can make this on your own
235:32 - and also we are passing the current user
235:36 - from the profile layout to the profile
235:39 - card as you see here
235:41 - like this we are passing it so that we
235:44 - can see our current profile name here so
235:46 - I have been logged in with nishanth the
235:49 - username let me log out okay we cannot
235:52 - log out from here because I mean we can
235:54 - log out
235:55 - but the problem is we have to set the
235:57 - same thing that we have open the home
236:00 - page
236:02 - we are having all of these checkings
236:05 - so the same way we can do in the profile
236:08 - page
236:09 - so let me do this
236:11 - in the profile page we have to do all of
236:14 - these so
236:15 - we can just copy
236:17 - these items paste it here
236:20 - and import the react use the state Hook
236:23 - and the use effect
236:25 - and edit here then we need a state for
236:29 - loading so let me also add it here
236:31 - like this
236:32 - then we need the navigate so let me edit
236:36 - here as well
236:37 - okay then the use effect hook to check
236:40 - for the authentication every time the
236:42 - page mounts
236:44 - then we are having this so let me just
236:47 - copy return loading
236:50 - if the loading is true which we'll see
236:52 - the loader else we will see
236:55 - the profile component like this now
236:58 - let's see like the thing is
237:01 - we have logged out so now if you try to
237:03 - go back to the profile page let's see
237:05 - what happens
237:07 - maybe it's going back to the home page
237:09 - instantly
237:10 - we cannot go back using this button as
237:12 - well so now let me log in with the other
237:14 - account called Nishan s440 at the rate
237:17 - gmail.com one two three four five six
237:20 - seven click sign in okay sign in and we
237:24 - are on this page
237:25 - now we have to go to profile page so at
237:29 - the route here and we will see the name
237:31 - for the user called Shan Kumar just like
237:34 - we see it here now let's style all of
237:36 - the items in the profile card a little
237:39 - bit here
237:40 - so this is a let's say an S4 tag or H3
237:45 - tag so make an H3
237:48 - I mean wrap the current wizard.fame in
237:50 - H3 tag and we're reading the current
237:53 - user from this file so if you open API
237:57 - by x2dp.com
237:59 - sorry.jsx we have this function called
238:02 - get current user and from here we are
238:04 - getting the data
238:06 - so if you save and then it will see a
238:09 - Min we will have this here the current
238:12 - username so give the class name of
238:15 - user name now let me come over to the
238:19 - SSS file and give them
238:22 - styling so the font will be I mean font
238:26 - family will be
238:28 - what was the name
238:30 - system UI
238:32 - so system
238:34 - UI now save and the font will be changed
238:38 - okay let me check the font here what
238:40 - font is this exactly
238:43 - and all the other items
238:46 - so the font color is this
238:50 - so we can add it here like
238:52 - color
238:55 - like this weight 600 600 so font weight
239:00 - 600
239:03 - font size 24 pixels
239:07 - okay
239:08 - save this and let's see we will get the
239:11 - Nissan command text here just like we
239:12 - have it here
239:13 - fine but
239:16 - it has a margin from the edges so we can
239:19 - just say
239:21 - sorry padding add it here so say 30
239:24 - pixels
239:26 - or 30 is too much try 20. 28 side is
239:29 - fine
239:30 - Kumar
239:31 - here
239:33 - now the next thing here we have is this
239:36 - title So currently the title is not
239:39 - inside the profile page so we need to
239:42 - add the title and all the items
239:45 - all the other items in this page
239:48 - in the profile page in the firestore
239:50 - database so let me open this quickly
239:57 - okay so it is opening so let's wait for
240:00 - it for some time so we have this users
240:02 - which contains two users
240:05 - this and this So currently we have this
240:08 - user and here we have to update the data
240:11 - like about and the location and the
240:15 - about section
240:17 - and all fine so we can also add the
240:20 - email so let me add P tag
240:23 - and we can say current user dot email
240:29 - save this and we will have the email
240:31 - here
240:31 - give this a class name of
240:34 - user email
240:36 - now save this
240:38 - let me make as capital
240:40 - and here and its capital
240:42 - now come over to here change the name
240:44 - here
240:45 - as well and
240:47 - this is the user email so margin top
240:52 - will be minus 10 pixels
240:55 - or we can just make it 15 let's try
240:58 - or 25
241:01 - okay let's make it 20 initially yes it
241:04 - looks fine let me use all of the items
241:06 - from here in here
241:09 - okay font
241:11 - will be select 16 pixels
241:13 - and we don't need the bolt
241:16 - but remove 600 and that looks fine
241:20 - I mean this is fine for us now let's add
241:23 - the other form Fields so
241:25 - first let me create one edit option here
241:28 - so let me make a div first
241:32 - and make a button called I mean in this
241:36 - button in this div let's add a button
241:38 - and this button will be called let's
241:41 - edit
241:42 - now save this and you'll have the button
241:44 - here
241:45 - gave this div a class name of edit BTN
241:49 - now let me copy the class and come over
241:52 - here
241:54 - let's give this position of
241:57 - position of absolute
242:00 - now right will be
242:02 - 20 pixels
242:04 - okay if it is happening so we have to
242:07 - make the card as relative
242:09 - so it sticks is it sticks here yes it's
242:13 - fine
242:15 - so we have this
242:17 - okay
242:18 - now
242:20 - let's also okay just leave the button
242:23 - like this here for now we will change
242:26 - the styling later
242:28 - so let me make all of the items
242:30 - let's say background color as
242:34 - White
242:36 - okay it's not working why
242:40 - okay it's because
242:42 - we are having the class
242:44 - of this edit button on the div not on
242:47 - the button
242:48 - so let's select the button here so we
242:51 - can say button
242:53 - and remove all of these items and it
242:56 - will be here fine but let's leave it for
242:58 - now we'll style it later because let's
243:00 - run the priority
243:01 - just we need to do I mean the one thing
243:03 - we can do is add a cursor
243:06 - as pointer and if you hover this the
243:09 - cursor will be changed to pointer
243:11 - no we need a form so we can create a
243:14 - component here called
243:18 - profile edit
243:21 - let me add
243:23 - index.jsx
243:25 - and
243:27 - index Dot scss
243:30 - in the jsx make it a functional
243:32 - component
243:34 - like this make this as
243:37 - profile
243:38 - edit
243:40 - here so let me import the
243:43 - styling file here
243:45 - which is index.scss
243:49 - save and now it's fine
243:51 - okay now what to do is
243:53 - when we click once again
243:57 - yes when we click the button we need to
244:00 - show this component so open the profile
244:02 - card
244:03 - and let me import the component here so
244:06 - import profile edit from this
244:10 - and let me get a state here
244:13 - so use state
244:15 - like this
244:16 - now let me add a state called
244:19 - is edit
244:21 - and set is edit equals to used it let's
244:26 - make it false because initially we will
244:29 - see this page not the edit page now
244:32 - let's have a function or not a function
244:35 - let's just map it here on the buttons on
244:37 - click
244:40 - and just revert the state like
244:43 - this
244:45 - fine
244:47 - now
244:49 - what we can do is
244:51 - okay let me wrap this in a fragment
244:56 - and save this nothing will change
244:59 - now just store like make the component
245:03 - here as
245:05 - I mean make this as what is it
245:09 - what can we say
245:12 - we can make it a conditional component
245:16 - but wait a second
245:18 - in the profile
245:20 - component
245:21 - I think we should do it here
245:23 - not in this page
245:26 - so
245:27 - let me
245:29 - remove the state from here and add it
245:32 - here I mean add real estate hook here
245:34 - remove the state from here
245:36 - and this as well
245:38 - and just add it here
245:40 - save them
245:42 - now let's add a function so say const
245:45 - uh
245:46 - on edit
245:50 - like this
245:51 - okay
245:53 - in this function I will set it like this
245:56 - that edit will be equal to
245:59 - I mean we will revert the state
246:01 - now pass the function on edit in this
246:04 - component
246:07 - save and let me come to this component
246:10 - and we are passing the current user and
246:12 - on edit okay just add it here
246:16 - and just add the function to this button
246:20 - we can now import the component of
246:22 - profile edit in the profile component
246:24 - directly
246:25 - so we can say import
246:28 - profile edit from here
246:31 - and then add one conditional rendering
246:35 - for the component
246:36 - so here we will have a profile edit is
246:39 - true we will show
246:41 - the component for
246:44 - profile edit
246:47 - save okay also need to add colon right
246:51 - now click edit we will see
246:54 - the index which is from profile edit
246:56 - component so just make it as
247:00 - profile edit to see the text but here
247:03 - also let's add a button like this
247:05 - to go back so just copy this and add it
247:10 - here in the profile edit
247:13 - okay just replace it
247:16 - let me have the function as props which
247:19 - is on edit
247:22 - then we have to pass this here as well
247:24 - the on a date function
247:28 - now edit and if you click this we will
247:31 - be on that
247:33 - card page let's make this as
247:37 - go back
247:39 - fine save and Let me refresh
247:43 - edit this we will be on this page now
247:47 - let me also add the card here which is
247:49 - called
247:50 - profile card
247:53 - so we can reuse the class name
247:56 - yes see it's working
247:59 - fine
248:00 - now in this let's add
248:04 - one input element or a few input
248:06 - elements
248:07 - so we can say input
248:10 - okay just add
248:13 - placeholder as name because what if you
248:15 - want to change the name
248:16 - okay
248:18 - now other apps will be
248:20 - let's say what else we have about so
248:23 - about will be f the text
248:26 - area type
248:28 - okay now let's say
248:31 - we have name
248:33 - let's say
248:35 - headline
248:37 - that we see here like this
248:39 - now save this and we will have the name
248:42 - and headline okay let's put them outside
248:45 - this div
248:46 - because this device is not for this go
248:49 - back button we have name and headline
248:51 - now what else we have here the location
248:53 - so let's add this as well
248:57 - don't worry we'll style them later so
249:00 - add
249:01 - location
249:03 - okay then I think that's all you can add
249:06 - other things as well let's add two more
249:09 - called
249:10 - uh company
249:12 - and College
249:17 - and save this
249:19 - now come here and we will have five
249:21 - inputs let me dab them in a div that we
249:24 - can arrange them
249:26 - properly
249:28 - now in this div give it a class name of
249:32 - uh
249:33 - profile
249:34 - edit
249:36 - inputs
249:38 - now come over to
249:40 - the file here in this scss
249:43 - and we can just say
249:46 - display Flex
249:49 - okay it's breaking while it is breaking
249:52 - profile card
249:54 - we have
249:58 - okay
250:00 - let's do what
250:03 - profile let me close this we don't need
250:04 - it for now
250:06 - okay
250:07 - let's make it as grid
250:09 - okay it's fine
250:11 - also
250:13 - we need to give a top margin at let's
250:16 - say 40 pixels yes
250:20 - let me add some gap between them to 20
250:23 - pixels
250:24 - like this we have name headline location
250:26 - company in college
250:27 - now let's style the inputs
250:30 - so in each of the inputs let's give it a
250:32 - class name of
250:33 - edit
250:35 - input
250:37 - so just copy the class and paste it all
250:40 - over
250:43 - here here and here
250:46 - save them
250:47 - now copy the edit input Class come here
250:51 - and we can just say
250:54 - a width
250:55 - say
250:57 - of 300 pixels
251:00 - and think that's fine height
251:03 - the 40 pixels also fine
251:06 - let's change the color but I guess we
251:08 - already have an input so let's get it
251:10 - from there all the styles
251:12 - so where is it
251:15 - let's say in the registered page I guess
251:17 - I mean component on the login component
251:21 - so class name is the common input
251:24 - the beginning was this so just copy
251:27 - common input and replace
251:30 - edit input here
251:32 - like this
251:35 - now let's check in I mean save and see
251:37 - what happens okay currently the input is
251:40 - limited to
251:42 - I mean this
251:43 - common input is limited to this local
251:45 - file called login component
251:48 - so we can move that into
251:51 - this component called
251:53 - main.scss so that we can access it from
251:57 - every year I'm in this component
251:59 - or do we have other page for says
252:03 - okay
252:04 - let's try SAS login okay let's move it
252:07 - in the index.css
252:10 - and
252:12 - what is the problem
252:14 - undefined variable linked in blue one
252:17 - okay so let's check the login components
252:21 - as
252:23 - and at the top we will have all of these
252:25 - three items so we can just add them here
252:27 - as also
252:29 - for now now we have name headline
252:31 - location company in college looking
252:33 - better
252:35 - we can type inside it
252:37 - okay
252:38 - let's save
252:40 - okay we don't need to save this fine
252:43 - now what to do is
252:45 - add the states here
252:47 - so let me get a function
252:49 - to say
252:51 - uh
252:53 - const get
252:56 - input
253:01 - and in here
253:03 - event
253:06 - and let's add the event on all of them
253:09 - so on change
253:12 - this I mean just simply add this on all
253:15 - of the events I mean inputs
253:20 - like this
253:23 - now let's also add the name for example
253:25 - this is the name that we have
253:29 - then here we have
253:31 - a headline
253:34 - then we have
253:36 - location
253:40 - then we have
253:42 - the company
253:46 - then we have the college
253:52 - like this
253:53 - now when we type in the inputs this
253:57 - function will run
253:58 - and we have to set them in a state so
254:00 - let's say const
254:03 - input
254:05 - I mean edit inputs
254:10 - and set edit inputs
254:14 - and should be small
254:17 - so you state
254:19 - which will be an it will be an object
254:24 - like this
254:26 - okay
254:27 - now in this method let's create a
254:30 - variable called uh
254:32 - input simple input
254:35 - and in here we will store
254:37 - them like this for example
254:39 - we will let me just redistructure the
254:42 - name and value properties
254:44 - so let
254:46 - name comma
254:49 - value
254:53 - from event
254:55 - dot Target
254:58 - fine now another input we will have
255:02 - a curly bracket let's add the key name
255:04 - which is name
255:06 - and we will add the value like this
255:08 - now if you console.log this input after
255:12 - typing
255:13 - I mean we will type the text here in the
255:17 - input and we will see our output in the
255:19 - console
255:20 - let's try this
255:24 - let's add my name called Nisha
255:27 - fine it's been saved and let's add
255:30 - headline called
255:31 - hello but if we type in here in the
255:34 - second input it will be overridden and
255:37 - when it will overwrite the first input
255:39 - that is why we have the state
255:41 - so we can set the state like this
255:43 - and also add the previous value which is
255:45 - edit inputs
255:47 - so we can append that
255:49 - zinc Ripple dots and it will be fine
255:53 - now let me just console this here
255:56 - see what we get so let me refresh
256:02 - go to the edit page let me add my name
256:05 - called nishanth okay it's
256:07 - happening like this
256:09 - okay I guess we don't have to use triple
256:11 - dots here
256:13 - and then try
256:16 - Let me refresh once more oh yeah we're
256:18 - fine
256:19 - we have to use triple dots on both of
256:21 - them because they both are objects
256:23 - now it will work fine
256:26 - click edit
256:28 - Nishant
256:29 - in the second let's add hello and it's
256:32 - getting appended now all we have to do
256:35 - is send this data to the fire store like
256:38 - here so then if we have the name as
256:41 - something
256:42 - this will be overwritten by the current
256:44 - name that we have
256:45 - fine
256:46 - now to do that let me create a method
256:50 - here in this API page or the
256:54 - I mean API file so we can say export
256:58 - const edit profile
257:04 - like this and just as we have we have
257:07 - don't we don't have it here so let me
257:10 - add
257:12 - two properties from firestore which will
257:14 - be Dock and update dock
257:17 - fine
257:18 - so
257:19 - this edit profile
257:23 - okay we need a button also
257:25 - so let me add it here
257:29 - button
257:31 - so if let's say in the button let's say
257:35 - tape
257:36 - we will have the button here
257:38 - so let me get the styling for the button
257:40 - as well from the
257:42 - register component or login component
257:45 - so we have it here this button
257:49 - which button this button
257:51 - so just copy this
257:53 - come to profile edit and and the class
257:55 - name and just rename this to save button
258:00 - now in this file
258:01 - for this
258:03 - CSS SSS let's add
258:06 - the save button
258:08 - and just add the class from login to CSS
258:12 - where is the login button this just copy
258:15 - this entire thing and paste here
258:19 - wait where it is it
258:22 - in this
258:25 - is it here
258:28 - is sit here yes here it is
258:31 - fine save this
258:33 - LinkedIn blue 2 is not defined
258:35 - so also can we get it from here
258:38 - all the three colors
258:42 - save and
258:44 - save this as well we know this
258:47 - okay what's the problem save button is
258:49 - not working so
258:52 - the file edit
258:54 - we have this
258:58 - what is the main dip called it is
259:00 - profile card
259:02 - okay we are doing it wrong we can just
259:04 - place it outside
259:08 - and now we have the same button here
259:10 - so if we have a save button let me make
259:12 - the card a little bit bigger
259:15 - so
259:16 - make the width to auto
259:19 - and we will have this
259:21 - now the save button should be in the
259:23 - center
259:24 - so
259:26 - we can make it textile and Center let's
259:28 - try this
259:32 - we don't need this for now
259:34 - okay we don't need the profile card for
259:37 - now
259:37 - we will need
259:39 - these three things
259:41 - fine
259:43 - now let's try to make them in the center
259:46 - but I guess we have to add a div
259:50 - here
259:52 - and add it here as well now this day we
259:55 - will have a class name of
259:57 - uh
259:59 - tinted
260:00 - I mean save button container
260:04 - or save container
260:07 - now let me add the class
260:10 - here
260:14 - do
260:17 - display of flex
260:19 - justify content Center and it will be in
260:23 - the center
260:24 - perfect
260:25 - now the function we're creating here
260:28 - edit profile should be on this button
260:32 - so but first
260:33 - we need to create a function here as
260:35 - well so say
260:36 - save
260:38 - uh profile data
260:43 - or make it as an update profile data
260:46 - because we need to update it
260:51 - Now update profile data
260:53 - will be handled on this button
260:57 - so on click
261:00 - this save this
261:03 - um
261:03 - now
261:06 - let's have the ID of the user that we
261:09 - are currently on
261:10 - so
261:12 - we will read it so to get the ID come to
261:15 - the
261:16 - profile component
261:19 - so we are having the current user here
261:22 - and let me pass it here as well to get
261:24 - the ID in the profile edit page
261:28 - so just add current user
261:33 - current user ID
261:36 - okay now let's try this
261:38 - so save it and open the console
261:42 - now the button when clicked will show us
261:45 - the ID for this current okay it's
261:46 - undefined
261:48 - so just say current user and see what
261:50 - happens
261:52 - okay we only have the
261:54 - okay we have this okay we have user ID
261:57 - not the ID
261:59 - so each user here have an ID that I sent
262:02 - previously
262:03 - that we cannot see here I mean yes it's
262:06 - here so it will work like that
262:09 - okay where we are getting these two here
262:12 - okay let me move
262:13 - and Save
262:15 - file now click it again and it will see
262:17 - the ID here for this
262:19 - now we have to send the ID in the
262:21 - profile component
262:23 - sorry here so we can say
262:26 - user ID
262:28 - Capital ID in camel case
262:32 - so first step to the do that is to
262:34 - specify which user we have to edit so we
262:37 - can say user
262:39 - to edit
262:41 - which will be having a dock
262:44 - and in the dock we will pass the
262:46 - reference
262:48 - which is the user ref
262:50 - with the ID
262:53 - and the ID is called this user ID
262:56 - now then we will call the
262:58 - update.function
263:01 - then we will pass
263:02 - the user to edit
263:04 - with the data that we need I mean the
263:07 - data we are editing
263:09 - so let's just get
263:11 - the data or maybe
263:15 - payload
263:16 - and pass it here
263:19 - okay then we can add all of these items
263:22 - like then and catch block
263:25 - and save it here and if then it's true I
263:28 - mean if we have then then we can throw a
263:31 - post called updated
263:35 - okay
263:36 - let me add let me change this I just
263:39 - noticed this document has been added
263:41 - successfully let's say post
263:45 - here
263:46 - now just add the same toast here and say
263:49 - uh
263:51 - profile has been updated
263:55 - successfully
263:57 - now all we need to do is call the
263:58 - function edit profile here
264:01 - and pass the current user ID in the data
264:05 - so let's make the data first so let's
264:07 - say let data
264:09 - and in here let's pass
264:13 - one second we can just pass edit inputs
264:17 - so we don't need this object
264:19 - so we can just pass this edit inputs
264:23 - so one second
264:25 - first is the ID then the payload so we
264:27 - are doing it in reverse
264:29 - first will be the ID wait
264:33 - yes not reverse it's fine
264:35 - now let me call the function here called
264:37 - edit profile
264:40 - we can import edit
264:43 - profile from API folder and just run
264:47 - this
264:50 - okay now let me refresh the or clear the
264:54 - console and
264:57 - go back
264:58 - click edit let me add the name called
265:01 - okay the name is Nishant Kumar so let's
265:05 - just add the name called nishanth let's
265:08 - write headline called
265:10 - hello this is Nishant
265:13 - location let's say Patna
265:16 - this let's say this college let's say
265:20 - vit
265:22 - let me open the network tab to check the
265:25 - request
265:26 - click save
265:28 - and document admin profile has been
265:31 - successfully updated
265:32 - and if you check all of the items has
265:35 - been changed like the name has been
265:37 - changed to Nishan location College
265:39 - company email and address headline now
265:43 - we can edit
265:45 - I mean we can add all of the items in
265:47 - the profile page
265:48 - so
265:50 - this was second email that we had this
265:52 - has not been edited so that's a good
265:54 - thing I think
265:55 - fine
265:57 - okay now one more thing more to do is
265:59 - let's just send us back when
266:02 - we edit the profile so we can just call
266:05 - on edit
266:07 - now if we can try again
266:09 - let's say this time this should be
266:11 - Nishant Kumar again
266:13 - now click save and we will obey on the
266:17 - home page sorry not the home page the
266:20 - profile page
266:21 - but what if we do this as a weight and
266:24 - this is a bit as well then make it as a
266:27 - sink
266:30 - now let's try again click edit
266:33 - let me add the name called the same okay
266:35 - if the name doesn't change
266:37 - it will not change or if you're not fill
266:40 - if we don't fill the field
266:42 - this will not change as well so name is
266:46 - the same the headline is Nishant
266:50 - Umar
266:52 - and just click up save here
266:55 - okay now it's the same thing okay
266:58 - the name is empty now okay
267:01 - let me try once more
267:03 - click save
267:07 - okay the problem is what
267:09 - the name is edited
267:12 - okay the name is empty
267:13 - let's add Nishant Kumar and then click
267:16 - save
267:18 - foreign
267:20 - but if we click save again
267:24 - okay nothing will be edited fine
267:27 - okay so that's working now come over to
267:30 - okay we don't need this
267:32 - come over to this second component
267:35 - called profile card and let's add the
267:37 - other properties as well like the
267:39 - headline company and all
267:41 - so
267:43 - let's set the headline here after email
267:46 - so we can just copy this and say
267:51 - headline
267:53 - not heading
267:55 - now in this CSS or scss
268:01 - we can add it here
268:03 - so where is the headline
268:04 - you're not Reliant let's say user email
268:07 - just copy this and add it here
268:10 - so we will have the same thing but we
268:12 - don't need the same thing
268:14 - we need something different so add
268:16 - heading
268:18 - and come over here
268:19 - and let's check the styling for this
268:24 - so we can just
268:25 - say here
268:27 - uh
268:29 - owned family is tell me why
268:32 - font size is 16px
268:37 - here
268:38 - let me seven check
268:40 - the same thing we are having
268:42 - okay let's make it as
268:44 - 20 pixels
268:47 - to make it bigger
268:49 - but the key name will be username Dot
268:52 - headline
268:57 - save and this will be here
268:59 - okay
269:01 - let me give this margin top of -20 as
269:04 - well
269:05 - or 10
269:08 - yes it's working
269:10 - okay
269:11 - let me make this as bold so font weight
269:14 - 400.
269:15 - 4600 not 400.
269:20 - okay this is I think fine
269:22 - when the starting doesn't match this
269:25 - so
269:26 - let me divide this back to section PX
269:29 - and this has 400 pixels
269:31 - the color will be this
269:34 - and it will be fine
269:37 - so I don't think we need to add the
269:39 - email because we already have the
269:40 - heading
269:42 - also then we can remove this class I
269:45 - mean the margin top best small
269:46 - differently
269:48 - or 25
269:54 - fine it's here
269:57 - fine now let me maniplicate okay we
270:00 - can't do that now now we can do that
270:02 - Nishan Kumar and let me add this value
270:06 - here
270:07 - in the headline
270:09 - save and we will see this
270:12 - fine
270:14 - now let's add the location here after
270:15 - the
270:17 - heading so we can just say p
270:22 - current user dot location
270:27 - save
270:28 - Now location will be this
270:31 - fine then on the right side we have the
270:35 - company and the college
270:37 - so we can do it but first
270:39 - let me
270:41 - see this thing called this heading
270:45 - this is on the two lines so we can do
270:48 - that as well so save it
270:50 - 200 pixels
270:53 - and it's much less so try Theta 400
270:57 - 400 is fine I guess now on the right
271:00 - okay let's make it as 350.
271:03 - on the right
271:04 - let's add
271:07 - these two things okay we also need to
271:09 - decrease the line height so what is the
271:11 - line height here
271:13 - line height
271:15 - is 20 pixels
271:18 - so we can say line right
271:21 - 20px
271:23 - and it's fine now it looks much better
271:28 - now let me close this and on the right
271:30 - we can add the other items so
271:34 - let me wrap this in a div
271:39 - INE
271:41 - in here
271:42 - let's add one more div for the right
271:44 - items
271:45 - but
271:47 - this is if
271:49 - should be also wrapped in another div in
271:52 - the parent div
271:54 - so that we can make them
271:56 - side by side
271:59 - so this day will have a class name of
272:01 - profile
272:05 - info
272:06 - I think that's fine now come to the
272:09 - profile card and let me add
272:13 - we have profile card then we have
272:15 - profile info
272:16 - so we can add it here
272:18 - then
272:20 - we can say display Flex
272:22 - for now okay let me just add the items
272:24 - here
272:25 - so what is the item that we need
272:27 - the college and
272:29 - the company
272:31 - so let me copy to pitax and add it here
272:34 - this will be
272:36 - um what is it the key name is college
272:38 - and Company
272:40 - so let's say this should be
272:43 - college and they should be
272:46 - company
272:49 - save them and we will see it here
272:53 - also
272:55 - the problem is let me add some class
272:58 - names okay we don't need heading for now
273:00 - okay save and this will be on the right
273:05 - okay so now displays Flex justify
273:08 - content will be space between
273:10 - to make them on the right side
273:13 - Also let's add the class here called
273:17 - write info
273:18 - for the info on the right
273:21 - and just copy this
273:23 - add it here
273:25 - in the profile info
273:27 - and we can say margin top
273:31 - 20 or 30 pixels
273:34 - yes it's better
273:38 - fine let me
273:40 - now do what we have vit and this name
273:44 - let's me let me style this
273:47 - so both of them have same styling so we
273:50 - can just say P tag here and
273:54 - just add the same styling in the both
273:57 - so
273:59 - the font is system UI as usual
274:03 - where it is
274:05 - and the color is the same okay okay not
274:08 - the color is in the same is different
274:10 - font size is 15px
274:13 - or 10 pixels
274:16 - then fade weight 600
274:18 - point with 600. save them Let's see we
274:23 - have this and this on the right
274:25 - point
274:27 - let me just change okay just let me add
274:31 - some margin from the right as well so
274:33 - margin right
274:35 - 30 pixels
274:37 - now it's better
274:40 - let me declare the line height between
274:41 - them
274:44 - light line height 24 pixels
274:48 - okay that's fine I guess
274:51 - but that is on the par okay with
274:56 - I think that's fine
274:57 - let me get
274:59 - the proper name
275:02 - and we cannot copy this
275:04 - okay it comes at the bottom if you click
275:07 - this that we can Implement later
275:09 - now let me edit it once more and add the
275:12 - company
275:13 - and college as this
275:16 - and will lower Institute of
275:22 - techno
275:24 - logic now click save and we will see the
275:28 - two items here
275:30 - so yes we can decrease the height
275:32 - between them and for that we need to
275:35 - make class names first for example it
275:37 - should be college and this should be
275:39 - company
275:45 - now in this P tag okay in this here just
275:48 - replace the P tag with comma College I
275:51 - mean dot college and
275:53 - company
275:56 - and we will have it here but in the
275:59 - company when it's a margin top that is
276:01 - negative
276:03 - so we can add that to make it a little
276:06 - bit at the top
276:09 - so edit here with too much let's try 15.
276:13 - yes it's better
276:15 - okay the font size is too small I guess
276:18 - so let's try 16 here
276:22 - okay or 15.
276:24 - the button was
276:27 - um
276:28 - what did we remove this let's
276:30 - it's it's better
276:34 - or just make it
276:36 - t
276:38 - okay a tip pixels or just 30. okay now
276:42 - it's fine I guess
276:44 - so our file page is done
276:46 - fine okay what if you make this as 20
276:49 - okay it comes on the level of level with
276:52 - this
276:54 - but if if if if we make the width here
276:59 - for the right I mean the left card
277:02 - let's decrease it
277:05 - not the card the
277:08 - heading
277:10 - so let's make it 320.
277:12 - I guess that's fine
277:15 - so if we do this
277:17 - okay if we did this
277:19 - we can replace the margin by 30 to 20.
277:24 - and make the margin drop by 25 okay
277:27 - that's fine I guess
277:28 - so this is how we created an edit pitch
277:32 - in the profile now the next item we have
277:34 - here is uh the posts
277:38 - so let me add the card for the posts
277:42 - so which is postcard I guess which
277:45 - contains
277:46 - okay not the postcard post update
277:50 - one second okay we need this block
277:54 - so let me come to profile card
277:57 - we have this div
277:59 - let me add it after this
278:01 - and when it all stresses
278:04 - so where it is coming from
278:06 - it's a array
278:09 - okay let me get the array let me create
278:11 - an edit State here
278:13 - let me create it here
278:16 - now what to do is
278:19 - okay when it import
278:22 - this posts card
278:25 - I mean used it first minute to Define so
278:27 - let me do all the same things here
278:29 - you will start a new memo defined
278:33 - when it's the post card
278:36 - so also Define that
278:38 - from this component
278:41 - if
278:43 - now what we have here is
278:45 - okay get unique ID note is not this
278:49 - fire at stored API let me get
278:52 - this use memo let me create it here
278:57 - where I will set the status
278:59 - okay gets status is not defined so let
279:02 - me also get it
279:03 - get status
279:06 - from
279:07 - quiet store API
279:10 - we don't need post sorry let me remove
279:13 - this
279:14 - Pi navigate to the posts here but the
279:18 - problem is
279:19 - okay
279:20 - let me get the post it is main here or
279:24 - even better let me have a div I mean
279:27 - class here called profile or just add
279:30 - the class here
279:32 - where it is post status Main
279:36 - and this will be on the center
279:38 - but let's make this as profile status
279:41 - Main
279:43 - we can just copy the class
279:45 - but okay let's leave it that it add that
279:50 - fine
279:51 - so it's fine but the problem here is
279:54 - we are seeing only though I mean we are
279:57 - saying all the posts even when the post
280:00 - is not our
280:02 - so we need to see only those posts which
280:05 - that we have made
280:07 - so we have to filter through the data
280:09 - which is all statuses and
280:12 - we have to add one unique param called
280:15 - ID
280:16 - or let me check so we have the
280:19 - okay we don't have ID do we have ID here
280:21 - no we don't have ID
280:23 - in the posts we have the email
280:27 - so we can use this email
280:29 - to check the post for us only us
280:34 - so here we have the email
280:35 - in one user chapter 440
280:38 - here we have another
280:40 - in one post we have one email in other
280:42 - posts we have another email
280:44 - so
280:45 - we need the email so we can get it from
280:48 - local storage or we can just
280:51 - filter the data so filter
280:54 - let's say item
280:56 - I mean the current item
280:58 - so return only those hosts where item
281:02 - dot email
281:04 - or user email
281:09 - triple equals to our current email
281:11 - from local storage so let me get it from
281:15 - here
281:16 - I guess from here like this
281:21 - so where is it we don't need the styling
281:24 - files we have to add it here
281:27 - now save and now let's see we will see
281:30 - the only one post here called hello from
281:32 - Nishant Kumar
281:33 - fine if you go to the home page we will
281:36 - say both posts but if we go to the
281:39 - profile page

285:41 - we click this button
285:43 - not the water I mean the name
285:45 - we should be on the profile page
285:47 - so let me create a function
285:49 - or a common function so
285:52 - in the page
285:54 - I mean sorry in this file called
285:57 - helpers let's say
285:59 - uh open
286:03 - profile
286:05 - but wait okay the problem will be we
286:08 - will we won't be able to use the route
286:10 - there because I don't know why so better
286:13 - to do it here
286:14 - so let me import the you'll navigate
286:17 - hook
286:20 - and create let Navi gate equals to use
286:25 - navigate
286:27 - now on this click of the name we will
286:29 - have on click
286:32 - and then we can just say
286:35 - navigate
286:38 - to
286:39 - the profile page so we can select we can
286:42 - say
286:44 - slash
286:45 - profile
286:48 - so let's check the profile page
286:50 - let me close this this profile card
286:54 - so here
286:57 - I mean profile card okay
287:00 - what is the page it's not profile card
287:02 - it's profile component
287:04 - yes so here we are having current user
287:09 - passing I mean get passed through
287:11 - and if we are having this current user
287:15 - we can also get
287:17 - the current user
287:19 - here so
287:21 - okay wait a second
287:25 - okay we are having the route so just try
287:28 - this first and see what happens
287:30 - now click Nishan Kumar and we will see
287:33 - nothing
287:35 - so if you open the console
287:37 - let's see what we are having
287:42 - we are having this object
287:44 - okay
287:45 - but we don't see anything
287:48 - if you refresh
287:52 - and then we can see it
287:54 - so
287:55 - okay wait let me think for a second
287:58 - so that problem has been solved
288:00 - I mean we have two post hosts here post
288:03 - one and post two one from Nishan Kumar
288:06 - and one from Nishant too
288:07 - if you click Nishant Kumar we will be on
288:11 - this page and the posts of Nishant Kumar
288:14 - will show up
288:15 - if you click Nishant to the posts of
288:18 - Nishant 2 will show up with the data
288:20 - here
288:21 - if you click profile page here
288:24 - the current profile that we're on will
288:26 - show up
288:27 - so let me tell you how I did that
288:29 - first of all we have this
288:33 - name
288:34 - and it is rendering the username like
288:37 - this so when we are clicking this
288:41 - name like Nishant Kumar we are sending
288:44 - us to the profile page with the current
288:48 - ID and the current email
288:51 - so let's now come to the profile page
288:53 - which is profile card
288:56 - here so here we are getting the data
288:59 - from music location Hook from reactor to
289:02 - Dom in location
289:04 - so it contains our ID and email that we
289:07 - were sending previously
289:08 - then now we have new two new functions
289:12 - from firestore API so let me show you
289:16 - so this function are called get single
289:19 - status
289:20 - okay wait a second
289:22 - this name
289:24 - get single status
289:26 - and get single user
289:28 - and in this two functions we are using
289:31 - query from Firebase firestore
289:34 - and let me show you we are importing
289:36 - query and where
289:38 - like this now let me come back to this
289:41 - get single status and get single user
289:44 - so these two are receiving the ID I mean
289:47 - in the single status we're reading the
289:49 - ID
289:50 - and in the single user we're getting the
289:53 - email
289:54 - that favorite saving from location Hook
289:56 - from react router
289:58 - then
289:59 - we are passing the ID in this query I
290:04 - mean basically by checking if the user
290:05 - ID
290:06 - for the post is equal to the ID of the
290:10 - current post
290:12 - like this
290:14 - meanwhile also
290:15 - when we sign up we will have the ID
290:18 - stored here so let me show you
290:21 - this ID user ID which is a
290:24 - string so when we are making a post this
290:27 - ID will be stored inside the post so we
290:29 - are on Nishan 2. we have this ID call it
290:32 - 579
290:33 - now come here to post
290:35 - and check this post
290:37 - here the ID is five I mean user ID is
290:40 - five seven a nine whatever and the post
290:43 - is here
290:45 - okay I mean whenever we make a post by a
290:48 - user we will store the ID of the user in
290:51 - the post
290:52 - that's what this is
290:55 - I mean by comparing the user ID with the
290:57 - ID so if it matches only then we will
291:00 - get the single status
291:01 - so
291:02 - this single status in this function we
291:05 - are passing
291:07 - thing set all status
291:09 - this state and the same way we have get
291:12 - single user to get the single user
291:16 - from this so we have the email filter
291:18 - here as query
291:20 - so in this we will we are having the
291:23 - email so let me show you
291:25 - both users have an email
291:27 - so when we click the list here I mean
291:30 - this option here the ID of the post and
291:34 - the email of the user is getting passed
291:37 - here
291:38 - in this component and furthermore we're
291:41 - passing the ID and email to the function
291:44 - so that we can filter it out and
291:47 - so only those posts that we clicked upon
291:50 - I mean the data
291:52 - and the username for example if you
291:56 - click Nishant Kumar here we will see
291:58 - Nishant Kumar and all of these things
292:01 - and the post details also
292:03 - if you click Nishan too we will see this
292:06 - but we don't see headlines and all
292:08 - because in this second user we are not
292:12 - having these items fine so that was how
292:15 - I did that
292:17 - file so
292:18 - also here
292:20 - we are having the few checks so
292:23 - the data that we are getting from the
292:25 - current user we are checking so
292:28 - if the data that we're clicking in
292:31 - for example I what I mean is
292:34 - this current data we have here current
292:37 - profile
292:39 - is empty when we click this button so
292:41 - let me show you why because in that case
292:44 - we are not passing any IDs
292:46 - so if you now open the console
292:50 - and click this profile this will be an
292:53 - empty object but you go from go from
292:55 - here
292:57 - to this page we will have this data so
293:00 - that's why we're checking here so if
293:02 - this look if this current profile
293:05 - dot length we are converting it to an
293:07 - array
293:08 - if it is 0 it means the object is empty
293:13 - in that case we will show this current
293:15 - user email or name or heading and all
293:19 - from here or else we will show
293:22 - the current profile when we are getting
293:25 - from here
293:26 - so that's how we did it
293:29 - I have added one key here also called
293:31 - user ID which is having the unique ID
293:34 - from here so whenever you register you
293:37 - will have the user ID from here that we
293:40 - will end later
293:44 - now let's design the profile page in
293:47 - LinkedIn I mean let's improve the design
293:49 - because it's very much simple
293:51 - when it's something like this so let me
293:54 - click the button here
293:55 - of user profile
293:57 - so you will see this thing so it looks
294:00 - much better much better
294:02 - but here it's very simple so let me go
294:04 - to the profile popup
294:06 - and remove
294:08 - all of these items so we don't need okay
294:11 - let's comment out all of these items in
294:13 - the
294:14 - UL block
294:15 - then let me create a common button so we
294:19 - can say
294:21 - we can create a folder first
294:23 - okay here
294:25 - in the common
294:27 - say
294:28 - button
294:30 - and here let's make index Dot scss
294:35 - and index.jsx
294:39 - this file will be of a function
294:42 - component
294:43 - make it a button here and remove this
294:47 - div
294:47 - and add a button here
294:57 - let's add the title and the title will
295:00 - come from drop so we can desecrate
295:03 - like this
295:07 - now we need to link the CSS file here I
295:10 - am in scss
295:12 - so import
295:15 - index Dot scss
295:19 - now save this come to profile popup Dot
295:22 - jsx and let me import this button so
295:26 - import
295:27 - ant from this component
295:29 - and add it in the pop-up card
295:32 - then let's pass the title as props title
295:35 - will be
295:36 - it is view profile yes
295:44 - save this click the button here and
295:46 - sorry pop up here
295:48 - I'm in the user icon and we will have
295:50 - this web profile icon I mean button
295:54 - then let's style the button so give it a
295:56 - class name of
295:57 - common
296:00 - BTN
296:02 - now copy the class
296:04 - come over here and here we can just say
296:07 - display of flex
296:09 - okay sorry not here instead we can do it
296:12 - in the pop-up card in the parent element
296:16 - so
296:17 - we don't need this
296:20 - and
296:21 - we don't need this either just leave the
296:24 - pop-up options
296:25 - here make display of flex
296:27 - justify content Center align item Center
296:31 - now the button will be in Center perfect
296:33 - like this
296:35 - but we have to like make it big
296:38 - so make uh but can we say width
296:42 - let's try it 400 pixels
296:45 - okay 300 or
296:48 - 350
296:49 - or 300
296:51 - or 200
296:54 - okay common button
296:57 - okay let's just give it a padding
297:03 - 20 pixels
297:05 - okay it's big so padding should be here
297:08 - I guess
297:11 - yes
297:13 - fine the pop-up is much bigger and a
297:16 - little bit bigger now and this also also
297:19 - we have some height here
297:21 - so let's add some height
297:25 - say 30px
297:28 - yes
297:29 - the cursor will be of pointed
297:32 - and
297:33 - let's change the background color to
297:35 - white
297:39 - okay
297:40 - I mean it's not completely White
297:43 - or is it just make it white smoke
297:46 - to blend in the color of the pop-up yes
297:49 - let me remove the Border or may change
297:51 - it so border 1px
297:54 - solid
297:55 - let's say this color the London color
297:58 - that we had so we can just copy it
298:01 - from

298:31 - so this this main file
298:34 - okay let's
298:37 - okay just let me use the color here I
298:41 - don't want to miss any time you can just
298:43 - figure it out on your own I guess
298:45 - this button is now having a border
298:48 - fine
298:49 - now the color should be
298:52 - also the same color that we have here
298:54 - but the Border should be led set to
298:57 - pixels
298:57 - yes
298:59 - the color is little bit light I guess so
299:01 - just make it light here
299:03 - okay then say color
299:06 - the same color
299:09 - fine
299:10 - border radius
299:12 - uh 30 pixels
299:15 - yes working let's now trigger the I mean
299:18 - check the fonts
299:21 - so
299:23 - just click this click this and hover
299:26 - this
299:27 - so
299:29 - we have this a system UI it was one
299:31 - instance
299:33 - okay
299:34 - on the system UI so font family
299:38 - system
299:40 - UI the next thing is font weight
299:44 - 600
299:46 - size
299:48 - for 10 PX
299:51 - and the color is this so let's repair
299:53 - the color I forgot that we I forgot that
299:56 - we can I forgot we can do that
300:00 - now let's check yes it's perfect we have
300:03 - your profile button
300:05 - like this
300:07 - let me close the what font
300:10 - okay what happened think
300:13 - the screen size was small
300:16 - like
300:18 - this okay no problem
300:21 - fine now it's fine
300:23 - okay
300:24 - now like this we have this
300:27 - but also a few items is on here like the
300:32 - title I mean this so let me edit this
300:36 - part here
300:37 - fine so first of all let me go to the uh
300:41 - button I mean on the button close this
300:44 - profile pop-up then come here
300:47 - let me pass this on click event
300:50 - here
300:51 - so we can just copy or cut the on click
300:54 - event
300:56 - from the list and just pass it here
300:59 - now in this button we can also remove
301:02 - and on click prop and on the button we
301:06 - can Target this I mean on click will we
301:09 - have one click
301:10 - now if you click the button
301:12 - it will be on the profile we are already
301:14 - in the profile page
301:16 - so click the button we will run the
301:18 - profile page and it's working
301:21 - like this knowledge let me also get
301:24 - these items like title and all but first
301:26 - we need to update it
301:29 - okay what I mean is let's see this we
301:31 - are having name and the headline
301:34 - so let me edit the headline here
301:36 - so name will be Nishant Kumar and
301:38 - headline will be this click save
301:41 - and let's show these items here in the
301:46 - pop-up
301:47 - so
301:49 - when you locate the items first
301:51 - so let's get it
301:53 - okay
301:55 - so open this API and firestore api.jsx
302:00 - here we have a function
302:02 - get current user I think yes let me call
302:06 - it here
302:09 - so
302:11 - yes so import get
302:15 - current user
302:17 - all we need to do is call this function
302:19 - so
302:21 - let's say here okay we're already
302:23 - already calling it here
302:26 - sorry I didn't saw that
302:29 - now we also have the state here
302:32 - so
302:33 - we can just Target current user dot
302:37 - let's say let me open Firebase
302:40 - we have the name and the user I mean
302:42 - name and the headline so let's just say
302:46 - name here for now check what we get
302:49 - so if you click we will get the name
302:51 - here but also we need to arrange them
302:54 - so let's say what let's say A P tag here
302:57 - a paragraph tag
302:59 - then let me just move this here and Save
303:03 - now in the pop-up card let me close this
303:06 - we don't need it also don't need this as
303:08 - well in the pop-up card
303:12 - class let's come over here and let's
303:16 - make Flex direction as column
303:20 - and we will have this
303:23 - okay I closed it
303:25 - why did I close it then we have the
303:28 - headline
303:30 - so also add one more P tag
303:32 - after this and just say
303:35 - current user dot headline
303:40 - headline save this
303:43 - and now we will have this but it's
303:46 - breaking I mean the width we need to
303:49 - increase of the pop-up card so better to
303:51 - make the height as Auto
303:53 - now let's see we are getting it here
303:56 - but there's the difference between the
303:58 - designs if you see
304:01 - here this should be current user or just
304:05 - make a class name of name
304:07 - and here make the class name of heading
304:10 - or headline
304:12 - now in the pop-up card let's design them
304:15 - both
304:17 - so the name is in the center
304:22 - okay
304:24 - so let me just click it and check the
304:27 - design for the name I mean the font for
304:29 - the name
304:30 - so
304:31 - here we can just write font size text in
304:35 - PX
304:37 - then color
304:40 - as
304:42 - this color
304:46 - okay can we copy this properly yes this
304:49 - color
304:50 - then we have
304:52 - font weight 600
304:55 - and I think that's all for this now
304:57 - close this let's check for the other one
305:00 - for the heading or headline
305:03 - let me copy the headline class
305:05 - and add it here
305:08 - then let's check for headline
305:15 - so font size is 14 BX
305:18 - so make it 14
305:20 - weight is 400
305:26 - then color is same so copy color and add
305:30 - here and I guess that's all
305:32 - yes save this let's try and it look much
305:36 - better
305:37 - let's try the font style okay it's enter
305:40 - okay we can go with interfont it looks
305:43 - perfect
305:44 - yes
305:45 - I mean it looks great in the name let's
305:48 - also add texture line as left to make it
305:51 - on the left
305:53 - it's not going on the left so I guess we
305:55 - have to make or remove this no not this
305:59 - align items
306:01 - yes now it's perfect
306:03 - then what can we do we can move the
306:05 - headline
306:07 - at the top so we can say margin top
306:10 - minus 20 PX
306:13 - or let's say 15
306:16 - yes it looks much better so for now we
306:19 - don't have the image of the user but we
306:22 - will add it later
306:23 - also one more thing I noticed is if you
306:25 - hover this button pop-up button it is
306:29 - changing the style a little bit
306:31 - so let me come to button
306:34 - here I mean in The Styling file
306:38 - just copy
306:40 - this and
306:42 - say okay one time only
306:45 - let's say hover
306:47 - here we can just copy the background
306:50 - color and the color and the Border I
306:53 - mean three things for styling
306:58 - so what can we change let's check
307:02 - okay
307:06 - the background color and let's make this
307:08 - as a little bit
307:10 - on the drag side a little bit dark
307:13 - that will be fine
307:15 - and this should be dark as well
307:18 - and then copy the class I mean color and
307:21 - just add it here also
307:24 - save and
307:25 - if you hover it it turns this but the
307:28 - white is too much Gray
307:31 - now let's try
307:33 - Pulsar too much
307:35 - just leave it at this
307:38 - and
307:39 - okay let's leave it at white smoke and
307:42 - just change the color of the
307:45 - it's not it doesn't work
307:47 - so I guess it's fine
307:49 - but we can also make it a little bit
307:51 - little bit little bit
307:54 - yes it's now perfect
307:56 - fine
307:57 - okay
307:59 - if you click reprofile from here from
308:01 - profile nothing happens
308:03 - because we are already the profile page
308:06 - but same way yes same way we if we click
308:08 - here nothing will happen
308:10 - also
308:12 - in the pop-up the name is at the top so
308:15 - let's make this here as well
308:18 - Magento just make not 15 make it minus
308:22 - 10 or 5 or 7 something
308:25 - yes
308:26 - so now we have this
308:28 - like this here
308:30 - okay
308:31 - now
308:34 - what to do is
308:36 - fix the profile from here like the name
308:40 - okay these are fixed I mean we have all
308:42 - the items here
308:44 - okay
308:45 - but the name here should be on the top
308:48 - we have Gap here so this shouldn't be
308:50 - here
308:52 - so
308:54 - let me also leave it okay fine
308:58 - okay
308:59 - let's not leave it
309:01 - just add the light tag here
309:03 - we will have logout option here
309:06 - we can also add button the same way we
309:08 - add it here but this time this will be
309:11 - of
309:13 - log out text so as you can see log out
309:17 - save
309:18 - then just copy the on click event
309:21 - on logout and add it here
309:25 - name of the list here from here
309:30 - save now the buttons are I mean two
309:33 - buttons are sticking to each other
309:34 - vertically so we have to make sure for
309:38 - that also of that also so let's say
309:40 - margin
309:42 - 10 pixels
309:44 - and 0. yes
309:47 - or not 10 that's a seven yes
309:51 - file
309:53 - okay
309:54 - now what to do is what to do yes this
309:57 - headline
309:58 - so let me come over to the profile
310:00 - pop-up
310:02 - okay not the pop-up say profile card
310:04 - this component here
310:07 - let me close pop-ups and this
310:10 - so here we have
310:12 - username
310:14 - let me come to this styling file
310:18 - so here let's make margin top
310:21 - minus 10 pixels
310:24 - yes now it's in the top
310:26 - also we can
310:29 - okay I think it's fine
310:31 - now see the button of edit is an icon
310:34 - here so let me also get the icon from
310:37 - react icons package so let me search on
310:39 - Google react icons
310:43 - okay
310:44 - so let me copy I mean get the icon from
310:48 - here
310:49 - let me search our first import icon like
310:52 - far beer
310:53 - at the top
310:55 - so let's search for Icon called edit or
310:58 - pencil
311:02 - in sale I think
311:05 - pencil
311:06 - yes you can use any icon here if you
311:09 - want so let me choose this
311:10 - it will be from
311:12 - h i
311:14 - slash hi
311:17 - yes and the name of the
311:20 - uh
311:22 - name of the icon is hi outline pencil
311:27 - so we can just add it here
311:31 - to close this here
311:33 - let me copy on click event or just cut
311:36 - it and add it here remove the button of
311:39 - edit
311:41 - now save the file and we should have
311:44 - this
311:45 - here
311:46 - but we are not having this here so let
311:50 - me give it a refresh
311:52 - I think it is still compiling
311:54 - let me view terminal
311:57 - yes now we have this pencil icon here
311:59 - but also we need to change some designs
312:02 - here as well
312:04 - for example add a class name here
312:06 - for
312:08 - edit
312:09 - icon
312:12 - and copy the class
312:14 - come to this file
312:16 - so the parent is edit button so where is
312:20 - it yes
312:22 - we can remove this
312:24 - and okay just add
312:25 - a DOT for the class
312:27 - so we will have pointer cuts
312:30 - also when we hover it we need to see
312:33 - some
312:34 - design so that we see on LinkedIn
312:37 - like let me show you this we should see
312:40 - this
312:41 - so we can just say background color
312:46 - white smoke
312:50 - also also also with
312:53 - a TPX
312:54 - height at TPX
312:58 - okay the height of this increases
313:01 - okay I guess what to do
313:04 - let's okay I think what is it here
313:09 - the background color is white smoke when
313:12 - we go over it it's not working
313:15 - I guess let's try some
313:17 - bold color like red and then try
313:20 - if it's working yes okay the thing is we
313:23 - need some padding here let's say five
313:26 - pixels
313:27 - now we have this if we have one we will
313:30 - see this
313:31 - then padding should be here as well
313:35 - yes working
313:37 - or let's make it three
313:42 - yes that also works but the color should
313:45 - be not white let's say I mean not red
313:48 - say white
313:49 - and let's change the
313:52 - Y2 some dark color like this
313:56 - now you hover we will see this but it's
313:59 - circulate so it's a border radius
314:01 - 50 percent here
314:04 - now we have a circular icon
314:06 - so make this as
314:07 - 5 itself
314:10 - okay
314:12 - what if we add margin and see what
314:14 - happens here
314:19 - also add margin here
314:24 - okay that doesn't work
314:26 - so what if you make 15
314:30 - yes it's bigger but 15 is too much try
314:33 - eight something
314:36 - let's do trial and error like this yes
314:39 - it's now fine
314:41 - I guess it is
314:43 - okay
314:44 - make it 10.
314:47 - and now it will be fine yes
314:49 - still no not not fine not fine not fine
314:52 - 14
314:55 - okay what is happening it's
314:58 - not blend the full icon here
315:02 - okay what if you remove it from here
315:06 - no no no
315:08 - okay let's leave it at 10. I think it
315:11 - will not fit like that yes
315:14 - look fine
315:16 - so we have the idea edit icon here
315:18 - like this so if you click this we want
315:21 - the we will be on the edit page
315:23 - okay we don't need to see this for now
315:27 - okay
315:29 - then what to do is what to do
315:33 - okay okay
315:37 - fine
315:38 - so if you look eight icon here
315:41 - we will be on this page I mean oh one
315:44 - model will open up but here we don't
315:46 - have a model we have one
315:49 - one extra page which is
315:52 - I think
315:54 - this page called edit profile
315:57 - or profile edit
315:59 - fine
316:01 - then here we need to add the values as
316:04 - well so
316:05 - get input so when we are loading the I
316:08 - mean click clicking edit button the
316:11 - values are not getting populated
316:12 - so we need to add the value so just say
316:15 - edit input for example
316:17 - add a value here
316:19 - and say edit input dot name
316:22 - and now if you click edit the name will
316:25 - be here
316:26 - but it's not
316:29 - okay give two profile view profile click
316:31 - edit the name is not here
316:33 - okay
316:34 - I guess why
316:36 - let me console this
316:43 - we did inputs one second
316:48 - let's see this
316:52 - returning it down
316:56 - Okay click edit
316:57 - okay it's empty why it is empty which
317:00 - shouldn't be empty
317:02 - um
317:04 - so when we're typing anything okay wait
317:06 - a second okay the problem is not this
317:09 - we need to get the inputs I mean get all
317:12 - the data from here like in the user data
317:15 - so let me open Firebase again
317:17 - one more time
317:19 - and get all the data from user here
317:24 - so basically I think we already have it
317:27 - I mean let me check the profile pop-up
317:33 - you cannot this
317:37 - so what is happening when
317:39 - when we're clicking
317:41 - the profile
317:43 - icon here we are on this page called
317:46 - profile edit
317:48 - so where we were rendering the page I
317:50 - mean in I think in the profile card
317:54 - no not here
317:55 - okay posts card
318:01 - there was a file I don't know where is
318:03 - it
318:06 - profile edit okay
318:09 - not here either
318:11 - profile card
318:15 - no not here either so where is it
318:18 - I think it's in the profile component
318:20 - yes here
318:22 - so we're reading the current data of the
318:24 - user and we're passing this in the
318:27 - profile card
318:29 - so come over to profile card
318:32 - and we're hitting it here
318:34 - then we need to pass
318:36 - this data
318:38 - where
318:40 - so it's complicated I think just we need
318:43 - to call
318:44 - the
318:46 - we need to call the API of current user
318:49 - to get the data
318:50 - Maybe
318:52 - so we didn't return profile edit
318:55 - this page
318:56 - fine
318:58 - so let me just call the function oh wait
319:02 - a second I think we have this current
319:03 - user already
319:05 - so let's check
319:07 - let's check let's check let's check open
319:09 - the console
319:13 - yes
319:14 - yes so all we need to do is just over
319:18 - this current user
319:19 - to this because then the name will be
319:24 - here and we can change it
319:26 - like this then we don't need the console
319:29 - log for now let's remove it and just add
319:32 - the other values as well like headline
319:35 - so
319:36 - in the users
319:38 - we are having the headline
319:40 - so just add headline
319:42 - and similarly all the other values like
319:46 - company
319:50 - then we have
319:52 - this college at college
319:56 - I think here if we left it should be
319:59 - location
320:01 - and I think that's all
320:03 - now check here and
320:08 - location is okay the problem is
320:11 - we only have the name and the headline
320:14 - not the location and the other things so
320:15 - we can type update let's say Patna
320:19 - this company and the college click save
320:22 - and the data will be here instantly now
320:25 - click the again this button again of
320:27 - edit
320:28 - the data will be here and then we can
320:30 - change it to something like Chennai then
320:32 - click save
320:34 - and it will be changed here as well so
320:36 - quickly
320:37 - so that's
320:39 - how we did this now what is the next
320:42 - thing we need
320:44 - Okay so
320:45 - click edit we have let's add these items
320:48 - like labels
320:49 - so
320:51 - for this let's say label
320:54 - and it will be first
320:56 - name
320:59 - let me copy the first name and okay
321:03 - just add the name we don't need to
321:05 - decrease I mean break it into first and
321:08 - then last name
321:09 - then label should be here for this but
321:12 - it will break because
321:13 - it will not break fine that's better
321:17 - then we have
321:18 - headline so say headline here
321:22 - then we have location so let me copy and
321:24 - paste labels all over
321:26 - like this here
321:28 - this here and this here now here should
321:32 - be College
321:36 - it should be company
321:38 - they should be location
321:41 - we are fine
321:42 - what the problem is the margin of the
321:45 - input so common input
321:48 - let me
321:49 - check profile edit
321:53 - where is this class
321:55 - here
321:57 - we are having margin top I mean margin
322:00 - this so we can remove this
322:02 - so make 0
322:04 - and also remove this from here
322:07 - okay
322:09 - then we don't need the slowest let me
322:12 - add
322:13 - margin top minus 10.
322:17 - or minus 5 something
322:19 - okay now it looks fine but 10 what will
322:22 - happen
322:23 - yes this also works now let's sell the
322:27 - label
322:29 - so let me close this file
322:32 - then label we need to style so
322:35 - just add the label in the profile edit
322:38 - inputs
322:39 - the profile edit here it is
322:42 - profile edit inputs let's say label
322:45 - point will be system UI as usual
322:54 - then all the input Fields will be of the
322:56 - same type
322:59 - close this and
323:01 - this
323:02 - and this okay what we need is now is
323:07 - the label is done
323:09 - okay the input so common input okay
323:13 - we needed it again
323:16 - so here
323:17 - we can
323:19 - just say Okay The Styling is same
323:24 - let me
323:27 - um
323:28 - okay what is okay the thing is the width
323:31 - I mean the height of the inputs are
323:33 - small so make it small
323:37 - shrink it now it looks fine
323:40 - okay
323:41 - also
323:43 - we can do this as well so label
323:47 - okay fine it's fine
323:50 - like this we have
323:52 - so
323:53 - let's also add a few more Fields here
323:56 - for example if you check that we have
324:00 - headline we are done we have position
324:01 - that is done
324:03 - we have industry education
324:06 - so let's also add industry
324:09 - so they should be before education I
324:13 - mean education is this college name
324:16 - so this should be before education
324:18 - I mean the college sorry
324:21 - so just copy this and edit make this as
324:25 - uh industry
324:28 - change all the items here
324:31 - they should be
324:33 - in
324:36 - industry
324:37 - pin what is the spelling Indus
324:41 - 3 yes here as well
324:43 - save this
324:46 - now we will have one more for industry
324:48 - but the data will be empty
324:50 - and we know data but we will add it in
324:52 - the post method later
324:54 - then we have location and City
324:56 - so
324:57 - let's add the location
324:59 - so they should be
325:01 - location
325:04 - then let that City
325:07 - then here we can add the T
325:12 - they should be city city and here also
325:16 - fine
325:18 - the location instead of okay admin okay
325:21 - I think that's fine then we are contact
325:23 - info then you can add website
325:25 - let's add it here also at the last
325:29 - which will be called as website
325:34 - so it's the model but we are having
325:37 - a page will continue to model that can
325:39 - be scrolled automatically
325:42 - so make this as website also
325:45 - fine
325:46 - we have link
325:48 - let's check this and it's perfect
325:51 - fine
325:53 - now go back
325:54 - and click edit again and the other
325:56 - things will be empty
325:59 - like this
326:00 - so that's
326:01 - in the edit page
326:04 - okay
326:05 - if you come here I mean let's also add
326:09 - few more items like about
326:11 - for example
326:13 - let me copy this and add one more and
326:17 - just say about but we don't have we
326:19 - won't have the input we will have text
326:20 - area so the text area
326:24 - like this and on change will be of
326:29 - it
326:30 - on change will be of this name let's say
326:35 - about
326:37 - me
326:39 - value should be the same for this I mean
326:42 - edit inputs about me
326:45 - then placeholder said will be
326:49 - about
326:53 - me
326:54 - we can remove this and check what we are
326:58 - getting here
327:00 - so we are getting this so let's style
327:02 - Okay add the class name also
327:04 - common input
327:07 - now we will have this
327:09 - we can change the head height and the
327:11 - width which is called rows and columns
327:14 - so say rows
327:15 - say rows will be 4
327:18 - and columns
327:21 - will be
327:22 - also let's say try five
327:27 - okay the problem is
327:30 - we can increase it
327:32 - let's remove rows and try
327:34 - give it a refresh
327:38 - the problem is the height is
327:40 - I mean the height of this is default so
327:43 - we can remove common input and add
327:46 - common text area
327:49 - text area
327:51 - save
327:53 - it's not getting big so make this as
327:55 - rows I think
327:57 - yes now it's getting big
327:59 - now come to
328:01 - the main
328:03 - dot scss I mean this file and instead of
328:06 - common input
328:08 - just add called
328:10 - common text area
328:11 - and copy the style all the things here
328:14 - except the height
328:16 - then add it here and we will see this
328:19 - about me where you can write your about
328:22 - me text
328:23 - then you can also add experiences
328:26 - education I mean all of the items skills
328:29 - and all
328:30 - so
328:32 - if we click skills edit it let's see we
328:36 - are forgetting what getting what we're
328:38 - getting
328:39 - yes so we can add a skill so let's also
328:42 - add it here
328:44 - last item
328:46 - so we can just say
328:48 - kills
328:50 - then
328:51 - we don't need this so better to make an
328:54 - input here
328:58 - like this now save and let's change the
329:03 - name to
329:05 - else here also
329:08 - also in this edit input.website
329:13 - it will be fine
329:16 - okay we need to avoid this as well
329:19 - these two classes when we are hovering
329:22 - and one with the placeholder
329:28 - save and
329:30 - now it looks much better now what we
329:33 - need to do is add all the
329:35 - keys I mean all the input to inputs to
329:40 - the
329:41 - this page so where we are posting the I
329:44 - mean updating the post
329:46 - open firestore API page
329:49 - we have edit profile

329:53 - so
329:54 - let me check the call

331:26 - now if you click it again
331:28 - we will see all the data that we saved
331:29 - here populating
331:31 - now all we need to do is just show the
331:33 - data here

332:52 - written that
332:53 - where where where where
332:56 - website website yes it's website
333:00 - so

333:05 - so just remove the country from here now
333:08 - save this and the website will be here
333:11 - like this but we don't need to make a P
333:14 - tag here we need to make it a tag
333:16 - so that we can click the link and go to
333:20 - the website
333:21 - so
333:23 - the same thing we can do here so just

333:47 - me show you what I mean
333:51 - let me go to the profile
333:54 - okay we don't see the attack
333:57 - what happened now

334:45 - yes we will have this about me but the
334:49 - problem is these items on the right is
334:52 - getting shaped
334:53 - so we have to change the okay we will
334:55 - change it do not worry please
334:58 - or we can just move this outside all of
335:02 - the item which will be here
335:04 - okay not here

335:09 - so we will have this perfect
335:11 - fine we have a beautiful looking profile
335:14 - card here
335:15 - then what did we add here in the profile
335:17 - edit yes skills
335:21 - so
335:23 - let's render it out
335:25 - and this will be
335:27 - kills

336:07 - this here in the P tag
336:09 - gave it a class name of
336:12 - till
336:13 - label for now
336:15 - okay it breaks the lines
336:19 - just make this as or make
336:22 - okay make this as a span
336:26 - and also here
336:30 - yes now it's fine now come I mean come
336:33 - over to this styling file here for
336:35 - profile card
336:37 - and here we have college company on all
336:39 - so let's write the selling here
336:42 - so but first
336:44 - okay let's do this so what is it let me
336:49 - add The Styling for the website first
336:56 - make this as skills
337:01 - so website where is it this
337:04 - so
337:06 - we can write it here as well
337:08 - so we need to change the color so say
337:11 - color
337:12 - of the text will be
337:14 - blue which is
337:17 - not here I guess let's try
337:20 - this SAS
337:22 - and
337:23 - this
337:24 - to copy this color or any color
337:28 - from here
337:29 - and just add the color here
337:33 - but it does not change
337:36 - what if we make this as important
337:42 - important
337:45 - okay let's make it as red and see what
337:49 - happens
337:50 - okay it's not changing
337:52 - I guess
337:53 - because we have some styling from for
337:56 - attack in index
337:57 - that we didn't remove
338:00 - okay it's not here I guess I guess I
338:03 - guess I guess okay
338:04 - so classes website class name
338:07 - but we cannot see the
338:11 - okay I think we need to make background
338:12 - color let's try this
338:15 - not working Let me refresh
338:19 - because I guess color will work
338:23 - but it's not working working why it's
338:25 - not working
338:28 - okay a tag we have it should work
338:33 - one more refresh let's try
338:36 - so in on undefined it's true but
338:40 - okay I guess we need to use Focus thing
338:43 - or Focus so say website
338:45 - Focus
338:47 - then add this color
338:51 - okay not focus
338:53 - let's say a
338:55 - tag
338:57 - what is it
338:59 - let's say a tag
339:03 - it tag the name is
339:06 - for

341:00 - a tag
341:01 - and check the colors
341:04 - we don't have any color for this a tag

341:41 - let's try it here still not working I'll
341:44 - leave it
341:45 - I don't want to waste time for this on
341:47 - this
341:48 - so it's fine now what we have is
341:52 - so this is done
341:54 - now let me click this button called edit
341:57 - but this button is go back so
342:00 - let's change it here as well
342:02 - so
342:05 - we are having go back but here
342:08 - we are having the x button
342:10 - so let me do that as well
342:13 - so this is from the profile edit page
342:18 - let me remove the button
342:20 - or just let me have the
342:22 - this icon
342:24 - so
342:25 - we can go to this page called react
342:29 - icons again
342:32 - and just change the icon I mean add the
342:37 - icon for
342:38 - close so we can say close
342:42 - let's choose this icon from AI
342:46 - so let me copy this and add it here
342:53 - and we were using this icon AI
342:57 - so make this as a i
342:59 - now replace the button with
343:02 - this icon
343:05 - and just make one click
343:08 - go back
343:10 - save this now let's try we need to
343:13 - increase the size of this
343:15 - so just to make
343:17 - the size
343:20 - to be let's say
343:24 - uh 20 wait a second
343:28 - 20
343:30 - okay 20 is fine let's try 25.
343:33 - yes much better
343:35 - so it works if you click this okay also
343:39 - let me let me give it a class name
343:44 - close icon
343:48 - and copy the class let me come over here
343:51 - not here I mean here's
343:55 - remove the button that we have here
343:57 - where is it
344:00 - and we don't have any button like it's
344:02 - just say cursor pointer on this class
344:07 - if you hover this the cursor will be
344:09 - changed to pointer
344:14 - okay it's not I guess because
344:17 - edit button we have
344:24 - okay let me I mean move it here
344:30 - yes okay not working not working
344:34 - area button profile card
344:39 - okay let me move it outside Jive then
344:42 - I mean this
344:45 - here
344:47 - now it's fine so just move it I mean
344:50 - just add it at the last not the first
344:53 - so
344:54 - we have all these items here we can
344:57 - close this and if you go to home page
344:59 - click this Prashant Kumar we will see
345:03 - all these items but if you click Nishant
345:05 - Kumar I mean okay we have the same user
345:08 - here
345:09 - and the posts are we getting here fine
345:13 - so that was how we did the
345:16 - okay I think
345:18 - we only okay wait it's not over it we
345:21 - only did the selling for the attack what
345:23 - about these like about and skills so
345:25 - just in the skills I'm in the span
345:30 - wait the skill level
345:33 - let me add a styling just make it bold
345:39 - so it's one ring sorry let's remove it
345:41 - just say
345:42 - uh skill level
345:44 - on weight
345:46 - as let's say 600.
345:54 - not working again
345:56 - okay not in okay okay I think that was
345:58 - the problem
346:00 - we are having this outside not in the
346:03 - inside of this slide info it's on the
346:06 - left
346:07 - so that was that is how that's why it
346:10 - wasn't working
346:12 - so just cut this and paste it outside
346:16 - now it's working yes perfect
346:21 - fine so if you remove this still it will
346:24 - work I guess now we had this skill level
346:27 - so let's add it here and say font wait
346:33 - 600.
346:34 - now this will be bolder
346:37 - let's change the font I mentioned the
346:38 - font here
346:40 - it's enter so it's I guess it's fine
346:43 - so we have this and it's working
346:47 - okay one second
346:48 - this is not working the country where is
346:50 - the country we don't see it
346:52 - location heading
346:56 - okay
347:00 - location current user dot country
347:04 - let me edit this
347:06 - country is here but not here
347:11 - so let me just try to console this
347:17 - okay I guess we made it as country not
347:19 - location
347:21 - That's why nothing is here
347:25 - yes now okay just rename the location to
347:28 - Country here
347:29 - where is it
347:30 - okay okay
347:32 - what's this
347:34 - I guess this should be done here as well
347:38 - wrap it in a back tick and just then add
347:41 - the country with location
347:45 - after the location
347:48 - now we can see that perfect
347:51 - fine
347:53 - so this is our profile page
347:56 - and we have the posts here we can edit
347:59 - them
347:59 - and save and then we can go back or just
348:03 - close this so that was our final profile
348:06 - page for the LinkedIn clone
348:09 - all right I don't think we need anything
348:11 - else here for now okay
348:14 - so I think that's fine
348:16 - we cannot integrate all of the items I
348:19 - mean you can integrate but it will only
348:21 - waste my time because they are very
348:23 - simple things okay so I guess that's all
348:26 - for now if you click the link here this
348:29 - will be on the new tab and if you go
348:32 - back we can still see this
348:35 - fine then
348:39 - now let's work on the like button system
348:41 - in LinkedIn or on LinkedIn but before
348:44 - that we need some fixes and this is it
348:48 - so if you go to any profile like Nishan
348:50 - Command 2
348:51 - this city is undefined here
348:53 - if you go to profile
348:56 - it's also undefined to fix that we can
349:00 - just change this to City the location we
349:03 - have here
349:04 - this location make it City
349:07 - and here as well
349:09 - and if you now check the profile the
349:12 - city will be Patna India
349:15 - Kumar it will be greater Chennai and
349:18 - this fine now close this this as well
349:23 - fine
349:25 - so as you see here that we have one
349:28 - button here
349:29 - so let me create a component here first
349:32 - for the like system so we can say
349:35 - uh
349:37 - wait a second in common let's have add a
349:40 - folder called
349:42 - like
349:43 - button
349:45 - fine
349:46 - here
349:47 - let me add one index Dot jsx
349:51 - and one for the styling
349:54 - like this
349:56 - okay here we can make a function
349:59 - component and the button will be called
350:02 - as like button
350:05 - simple
350:07 - now
350:08 - let me import
350:10 - the CSS file or SSS file
350:13 - so index
350:16 - Dot scss
350:18 - now let me add a button I mean wait
350:21 - so we need one icon here so we will add
350:23 - it but before that let me add one P tag
350:26 - and say
350:27 - like
350:30 - so now let me get the button here
350:33 - in this component called posts card
350:35 - import like button from the component
350:39 - route and add it here like this
350:44 - fine
350:45 - so it's here
350:48 - now let me import the icon from react
350:51 - icon so import
350:53 - from
350:55 - react icons
350:58 - slash let's say
351:00 - let's try bi
351:03 - and if you type like like button
351:06 - or let's say beer like
351:08 - or bi like let's see what we have if you
351:11 - if you render it here
351:14 - so save I think it's optimizing the
351:17 - dependencies
351:18 - so meanwhile we can check other
351:20 - uh we can check other like buttons as
351:23 - well I mean other phone icons sorry
351:28 - so let's try for like
351:35 - so we can try outline for AI like this
351:39 - let me try this and make this as a i
351:43 - now just replace the button with this
351:47 - okay why it is not showing up here let's
351:50 - check open the view okay now it's
351:52 - showing up fine let me add the size of
351:55 - the icon to be much I mean to be bigger
351:57 - so let's say 25 what yes
352:02 - yes it's big we can try for 30 also
352:06 - yes also better
352:09 - this day we have a class and we'll have
352:10 - a class name of
352:13 - let's say like
352:15 - container
352:18 - fine let me just copy the button class
352:20 - I'm in deep class and add it here
352:23 - and we will make display as Flex
352:26 - then justify content
352:30 - okay we don't need this this property we
352:31 - don't need we need align item
352:34 - enter
352:35 - yes now it's in the center
352:39 - so we have like text and the icon little
352:43 - gap between them so
352:45 - 10 pixels will it work yes
352:49 - then we need some add some padding
352:52 - 20 pixels
352:54 - okay padding let's try
352:57 - 20 and 0. okay I think 0 and 20 will
353:01 - work
353:02 - yes
353:04 - if we try 10
353:06 - fine also working
353:08 - we try if you make this as 5 here
353:12 - and I think that's also fine
353:15 - so we have like button here
353:17 - let me change the font here
353:19 - so just say P tag
353:21 - Point Family system
353:26 - UI
353:28 - fine
353:32 - let me check the fonts here
353:37 - so it's normal weight is 600 so say font
353:40 - weight
353:41 - 600
353:43 - okay then color is this
353:48 - so the color
353:50 - this
353:52 - fine I guess now let's check
353:54 - okay we have this here
353:58 - now font size 14 bits
354:06 - I think that's all for this button
354:08 - we can leave it at that
354:10 - okay
354:11 - fine
354:13 - okay in the in this div we have to make
354:16 - cursor as pointer so if you hover the
354:19 - icon or button you will see
354:21 - this pointer cutter also the Gap is Big
354:25 - so let's make it 5 only
354:27 - yes and then this padding is seven
354:31 - okay I think that's fine
354:35 - I guess it's fine
354:37 - then what can we do here is close this
354:41 - okay
354:43 - okay so we have the like button here
354:47 - so now what we have to do is
354:50 - when we click the button we need to send
354:53 - some ID which is the I mean we need the
354:56 - post ID and the user ID
354:59 - fine
355:01 - so we can get it
355:03 - so let me create a function here
355:06 - so okay not here
355:09 - so this is const
355:11 - let's say
355:13 - let's say on let's say handle like yes
355:21 - here
355:22 - now on this button click I mean on this
355:25 - div click we should have this
355:27 - function
355:30 - okay now as I said that we need to pass
355:34 - the ID of the post that we are going to
355:37 - like and the ID of the user who is going
355:40 - to like it
355:41 - so we can do it like this
355:43 - so
355:44 - we need two things that I said
355:48 - okay one second
355:51 - yes we need the user ID
355:53 - user ID
355:56 - and the user ID will be
355:58 - this ID so we are having posts and the
356:02 - ID
356:04 - okay
356:05 - so where can we get the user ID from we
356:07 - need the current user
356:09 - so we can
356:11 - go to this file store dpa.jsx and do we
356:15 - have one function called get current
356:17 - user so let's get it here
356:19 - so we can just say import
356:24 - get
356:25 - current
356:27 - user
356:29 - and then we can call the function in use
356:32 - effective or use memo
356:36 - say this
356:41 - okay
356:42 - get current user
356:43 - so it takes a param called Set current
356:46 - user so we need one state as well so say
356:51 - current
356:54 - user comma set
356:57 - current user equals to use State say
357:00 - let's send object because the data is in
357:03 - object format
357:05 - so just pass it like this
357:08 - and all we need to do is console.log
357:10 - this current user
357:13 - so save okay we don't we have to remove
357:15 - this for now we will add it later
357:18 - now open the console
357:22 - here
357:23 - and we have an object and here we have
357:26 - the ID and this ID is called the user ID
357:30 - so we can just say current user.id
357:34 - so
357:36 - now this let me remove this and pass
357:40 - user ID as
357:43 - this and post ID equals to
357:48 - posts let me console the posts also
357:54 - to show you the posts let me just remove
357:58 - this it will control Z this is called
358:01 - the post ID so let me show you in
358:03 - Firebase
358:07 - yes so if you check here
358:09 - that we have post I mean posts and every
358:13 - post has an ID
358:15 - come over here
358:17 - and if you refresh the page
358:20 - okay we are saying
358:22 - posts here
358:24 - okay a lot of posts we are seeing
358:28 - so better to have the ID from them I
358:30 - mean get the ID
358:32 - so we can just say posts
358:35 - dot ID
358:38 - now refresh it once more
358:40 - and we will have a lot of IDs here
358:43 - see so we are having this this this two
358:48 - times we have every ID
358:50 - for example
358:52 - [Music]
358:52 - um
358:53 - yes we have all the IDS here for all the
358:57 - posts four IDs four posts
359:00 - then second param will have to pass I'm
359:03 - an argument we have to pass
359:06 - is the post ID as
359:10 - this
359:14 - so the post ID will be posts dot ID
359:18 - let me remove control law
359:20 - now let's get it here
359:22 - so we can say
359:25 - user ID
359:27 - comma post ID
359:31 - fine we have to structured it here now
359:34 - on this function handle click we will
359:37 - call a method that will be inside this
359:40 - api.jsx
359:42 - so let's close styling file we don't
359:43 - need it right now
359:45 - so here let me add one function called
359:48 - export const
359:50 - and or say
359:53 - like
359:54 - post
359:58 - and in here we will create one
360:02 - uh what is it we will create one
360:04 - document
360:05 - for example as I say as you see I am
360:09 - getting the user ID and post select pass
360:12 - let's pass it here
360:14 - I mean I mean we will call the function
360:16 - here let me call it
360:19 - this function so
360:22 - import
360:23 - uh what is the name what is the name
360:26 - like post
360:28 - here
360:29 - so simply we can just call this and in
360:32 - here we can pass these two things
360:35 - like this so it will get up here fine so
360:40 - this step is done
360:42 - now let me just show you in the console
360:44 - what is it we are getting
360:47 - for the user ID
360:50 - and the post ID
360:54 - open the console let me open the console
361:00 - let me close this
361:02 - so let's click this like
361:04 - so the post ID for post 4 is all right
361:08 - something and I am having this user ID
361:12 - so let me now check users we have three
361:14 - users
361:15 - and I have logged in with this user to
361:18 - zero something
361:23 - one second which user we have wait no
361:26 - this is the post that is sorry
361:27 - this is the post ID and the user ID is
361:30 - r80
361:31 - I mean this user second user
361:35 - so let me show you I mean confirm it go
361:37 - to profile and Nishan Command 2 is there
361:40 - like this it will take and all
361:43 - fine so this is the idea of this current
361:47 - percent
361:48 - Nishant Kumar 2 I mean if you click like
361:50 - you will see it again see it again
361:54 - then the second one is called the post
361:55 - ID so for post 4 let me show you
362:00 - where it is post for the ID is 2 0
362:03 - sorry 2 2 0 a u whatever this is ID
362:07 - so we're eating it so now we have to
362:10 - create a document that contains these
362:14 - two IDs together so that we can have
362:18 - they made firestore so first of all we
362:21 - need to create one reference which is
362:24 - called a like reference
362:26 - so I mean like ref likes ref
362:29 - but the likes collection for the lit
362:32 - like
362:33 - ref equals to
362:35 - collection
362:37 - let's say fire store comma likes table
362:42 - now now now now now we have to use this
362:44 - so we can just remove these items
362:47 - then we can do this
362:50 - here so basically
362:52 - we will create a
362:54 - let doc
362:58 - to
363:00 - like equals to we can say Doc function
363:04 - that we need to import I guess
363:07 - yes we are already importing it yes
363:10 - we are using it in edit profile function
363:13 - so this takes three things and the first
363:16 - one is called Firebase
363:17 - certifiers.net Firebase
363:20 - database I mean
363:22 - then the second thing it takes is the
363:24 - collection I'm in the reference sorry
363:28 - I don't know I am
363:30 - missing words to say it takes this like
363:33 - like surf that contains firestore and
363:36 - the likes
363:38 - one second
363:40 - okay
363:42 - no sorry we did it wrong it takes the
363:45 - first as like sir because we already
363:48 - have fire stored inside it and the table
363:50 - name which is likes
363:52 - then we will have to merge these two uh
363:57 - let's say we merge these two user ID and
364:00 - post ID
364:01 - to create a collection ID a dynamic ID
364:04 - so add a
364:06 - dollar and say post ID and
364:10 - I mean user ID and post ID like this
364:12 - fine
364:14 - also let me add one underscore here
364:18 - fine I think that will work
364:21 - I think that will not work because
364:24 - this is not dynamic dynamic field are
364:27 - only user ID and post ID
364:29 - so let me revert them back
364:31 - and we can say user ID
364:34 - outside the curly bracket and underscore
364:37 - and then say
364:40 - uh dollar again
364:43 - curly bracket post ID
364:45 - now we have we will have any kind like
364:48 - this that will show up in the like
364:50 - stable in fired store
364:52 - now that's done
364:54 - now we need to set the dock so let me
364:58 - import a function called set dock
365:01 - so this is different from add and
365:04 - because it sets the document like this
365:07 - using a unique ID
365:10 - that we can Define our own
365:13 - so we can say
365:15 - we can say we can say what is the name
365:17 - get doc sorry not get doc said doc let
365:21 - me just import it and in here
365:23 - we will pass
365:25 - this document and the data that we need
365:29 - to store
365:30 - so we will store the user ID and post ID
365:32 - as object like this fine
365:37 - now let's try to run this
365:40 - so all is set
365:42 - okay
365:43 - now let me open the
365:46 - console and clear it
365:48 - we can also okay I mean let's just trap
365:53 - not trap just
365:56 - add or wrap them in try catch block
365:59 - so that we may have some knowledge of
366:02 - the errors if we have them
366:05 - catch so say error
366:15 - what's happening
366:17 - try and
366:20 - wait I forgot the syntax
366:24 - again it's not here it's in this auth
366:27 - API so let's check okay catch error okay
366:30 - this is how it works sorry I forgot this
366:34 - so catch
366:37 - error
366:39 - console.log
366:43 - err
366:45 - or now let's click the like button here
366:48 - in the first post called post 4.
366:51 - so we have clicked it
366:52 - now let me check the fire store let me
366:56 - give it a refresh
366:59 - I hope we will have a like table here
367:03 - yes see we have the likes collection
367:05 - in this new in this document so
367:09 - see we are merging the user ID with post
367:13 - ID
367:14 - this user ID is from R8 and this post ad
367:17 - is this
367:18 - so we have this
367:20 - so our post has been liked fine but we
367:25 - have liked the post
367:27 - now let's get the posts I mean sorry
367:29 - let's get the let's get the likes here
367:32 - so to get the likes we need
367:35 - to have I use effect hook here as well
367:38 - so I'm in here
367:41 - okay what I am saying here
367:44 - it's 1 41 am at the night and I'm doing
367:48 - all of this so let me have one use memo
367:52 - so when the page loads we will have all
367:55 - the likes for the
367:57 - page
367:58 - okay we have imported it also then in
368:01 - this use memo hook
368:03 - we have to call a function from this API
368:06 - file so also create its export const get
368:11 - likes
368:13 - by
368:15 - by user
368:20 - then
368:21 - also let me add try catch block here to
368:25 - not have some errors
368:27 - fine and in this uh in this try block we
368:32 - will have one variable called let's say
368:35 - let likes
368:37 - like this
368:39 - okay not this but first let me create
368:42 - one query to filter the likes based on
368:45 - the post ID
368:47 - for that we need to First copy the
368:49 - function and import it here
368:52 - and use it in this use memo
368:55 - then we can pass the IDS here
368:58 - which is user ID and post ID
369:01 - so I don't think we need the user ID but
369:03 - let's just pass it so let me get it here
369:05 - as well
369:06 - now let me create a query here so let's
369:09 - say let like query equals to
369:14 - we can use Query
369:16 - and in here we can add a collection
369:20 - so the collection is already this
369:22 - collection if you go over to this we
369:25 - have this collection called like serif
369:27 - so we have to use this collection name
369:30 - like Express
369:32 - then what can we do is
369:34 - we will have to make a
369:39 - yes where
369:41 - where
369:42 - and in the where we will have
369:46 - we will check for post ID
369:49 - double equals to
369:52 - wait what happened double equals to this
369:55 - post ID
369:57 - so basically
369:58 - we will check if the post ID is equal to
370:01 - this post ID
370:03 - only then we will return it
370:07 - now
370:09 - I mean the post ID of the post is equal
370:13 - to the post ID of the database data from
370:15 - we are getting from the database
370:18 - then we have to
370:20 - use the on snapshot function
370:22 - on Snapshot for real-time data and in
370:26 - here we will pass
370:28 - this query called like query
370:31 - like query
370:33 - comma it sends a response social
370:36 - response
370:37 - and we can simply
370:41 - do this
370:43 - so we can simply create a variable
370:47 - called it like
370:49 - or likes
370:51 - and in here we can say snapshot
370:56 - snapshot
370:58 - snapshot Dot
371:00 - Docs
371:01 - dot map
371:03 - and then it takes a param called dock I
371:07 - mean
371:08 - yes we can say a param and then it
371:10 - returns log.data
371:13 - like this fine it's done
371:15 - so now this lags contain all our data
371:19 - for the like so if you try to console
371:21 - this
371:22 - but in a second this wheel where not
371:25 - snapshot fine
371:27 - now let's check in the console what we
371:29 - are getting if we refresh the page
371:32 - okay we don't need the user ID I guess
371:34 - so remove it
371:37 - fine
371:38 - so we're getting nothing are we calling
371:41 - this
371:42 - yes we are calling this but the problem
371:44 - is we have to run the use memo hook
371:47 - whenever this user ID and post ID
371:49 - changes then we will get the likes but
371:53 - we're not getting it
371:56 - so where are they missing
371:59 - so
372:00 - [Music]
372:01 - um
372:02 - on Snapshot like query we're passing
372:06 - fine
372:09 - the problem is here see we are having
372:12 - the post ID from this param
372:17 - I mean we are passing it from here
372:19 - but we're not passing the post ID only
372:22 - we are passing the user ID
372:24 - so in this case the reactor thinks or
372:27 - JavaScript things
372:28 - that this post ID is the user ID because
372:32 - it's a first param so if you remove this
372:35 - and save the error will go away
372:39 - so let me now check see we are writing
372:41 - this array and it contains our post ID
372:44 - and the user ID like this
372:47 - fine now what we have to do is we have
372:50 - to store the number of likes
372:53 - count in a variable
372:56 - so let's do that
372:58 - so to do that we will create we will
373:00 - create a lead variable called likes
373:03 - count
373:05 - equals to likes
373:08 - dot length
373:12 - length yes
373:14 - fine now we'll filter through the likes
373:18 - so see which likes are from which post
373:22 - I mean not from the which post from
373:24 - which user that is why we also need the
373:27 - user ID but I removed it so
373:29 - let's get it back
373:31 - user ID also let me pass it from here
373:34 - first param
373:36 - save this and this
373:37 - now here we will just do this and this
373:41 - means
373:43 - const
373:44 - light
373:47 - or say is like which post are liked by
373:51 - which user because we have multiple
373:52 - users and multiple posts
373:55 - fine
373:56 - so we can just
373:57 - click the likes dot sum
374:00 - and in the sum we will have a param
374:03 - called like and then we will check if
374:06 - the like dot user ID
374:09 - I mean from this uh dislikes
374:14 - we had the user ID if this like is
374:16 - equals to the user ID by getting from
374:20 - the Para
374:21 - user
374:23 - ID
374:25 - fine
374:26 - we have this is liked and likes count
374:29 - which we need now
374:31 - in this let me create two states so one
374:34 - will be
374:35 - like
374:38 - count and set likes
374:42 - count
374:44 - so it will be a number say zero
374:49 - or we can make it null but let's make it
374:51 - zero fine now second state when it is if
374:55 - the post is liked or not
374:57 - so still liked and set
375:00 - light
375:02 - so it's date
375:04 - and here we will have false because
375:07 - initially we will make it false because
375:09 - the posts will be unlike
375:11 - now let's pass these two here
375:14 - as
375:15 - params
375:17 - let's get it
375:19 - in here
375:21 - here
375:23 - so like this
375:25 - now
375:27 - we'll simply set
375:29 - in the likes count
375:31 - I mean set likes count will be equal to
375:34 - likes count then is like will be equal
375:37 - to
375:38 - so it is like will be equal to is light
375:41 - fine so our work here is done almost in
375:45 - this git likes by user function
375:48 - now if you console let's count here CLG
375:52 - this let's see what we get in the
375:55 - console so come to the bottom
375:58 - fine we will get zero okay we are
376:00 - writing this set likes count is not a
376:03 - function
376:05 - set likes count
376:07 - it's not a function then what is it
376:12 - so now let me try
376:15 - light just refresh the page once and see
376:18 - what happens
376:19 - maybe some error and it will go away
376:21 - so
376:23 - okay it's false I don't know why
376:27 - set like sound is not a function
376:30 - so set likes count Lex count let me make
376:34 - it like this
376:36 - and see what happens what happens
376:39 - refresh
376:48 - set like sound does not function why is
376:51 - this happening
376:57 - huh
377:02 - okay just leave it for now
377:04 - okay
377:05 - firestore API 147
377:09 - 147
377:12 - okay now 114 this like this line so
377:16 - let's console it
377:25 - and
377:27 - it is like it's not a function now
377:30 - okay now why are we getting this
377:34 - huh
377:38 - what can we do here
377:42 - okay fine fine we are passing it at the
377:46 - wrong place we should pass it here
377:49 - now let's see this will work fine
377:54 - maybe I am dumb to make this kind of
377:58 - mistakes
378:00 - so we are getting false because posts
378:03 - are unliked okay
378:05 - so
378:06 - now this is done
378:08 - okay now we have likes comment and liked
378:11 - so if your internet likes count here
378:14 - so we will see
378:16 - we have one like on this post and this
378:19 - post so in this we will have two posts
378:24 - here I'm into we have two items
378:27 - and the post ID is same first user ID is
378:30 - same
378:31 - yes the post side is different it paints
378:34 - two of the posts are liked if you click
378:37 - third one this will turn to one and it
378:40 - will be updated here
378:42 - but the thing is if you click it again
378:45 - this will not be unlocked
378:47 - so that's a problem
378:49 - but before that let me show you let me
378:51 - go to other profile so we are on this
378:53 - profile called
378:55 - design command 2.
378:56 - let me log out and remember that we have
378:59 - liked post 2 1 and post four not post
379:03 - three from Nishan Command 2
379:06 - now let me come to this page called
379:09 - I will fix that also I'm in this issue
379:12 - that we have in login page and the
379:14 - registered page at the last of the video
379:17 - I'm in this section
379:19 - now sign in
379:21 - see
379:22 - the likes is one but
379:25 - we are not saying okay
379:26 - if you click it again the like will be
379:28 - two
379:29 - here the like will be two and all of the
379:32 - data is stored here as post ID and user
379:36 - ID collection name
379:38 - document name
379:40 - The Collection field is here okay now
379:43 - what we have to do is we have to pass
379:46 - this light in this like post to handle
379:50 - the dislike function as well
379:53 - so let me get here
379:56 - so we will run the set dock only if the
379:59 - post is not liked else we will run one
380:04 - more property called delete dock that
380:06 - will delete the like from The Collection
380:09 - using this dock I mean this will delete
380:12 - the like only that we have had fine
380:16 - so to do that we can simply add
380:20 - delete dock
380:23 - with second delete
380:26 - doc not delete doc yes and just pass the
380:31 - like I mean the doc to like this
380:36 - now save and
380:37 - now let's check if you click it again
380:41 - it will be removed from here but it's
380:43 - not it's not
380:45 - is it getting removed
380:48 - one second
380:51 - I think we are doing it correct delete
380:54 - dock is it okay we have to import it
380:56 - also sorry we are not importing it
380:59 - delete talk
381:02 - yes
381:03 - now check click the button
381:06 - and
381:07 - still not working
381:10 - okay
381:12 - but why
381:14 - okay let's do this
381:16 - so if the likes exist
381:20 - like I mean if the light is true we will
381:23 - show
381:24 - light else we will show like
381:28 - now let's see what we have here
381:31 - so click this okay it's not working
381:35 - okay the problem I mean the issue is
381:38 - here so we are having the ID so I think
381:42 - I made a typing mistake this should be
381:44 - user ID
381:45 - now it will work
381:47 - so click it again and as you click it
381:49 - again we will see that the like has been
381:52 - removed from this post
381:54 - click it again you will have like so the
381:57 - current likes number is 2. and on this
382:00 - post we have zero
382:02 - so let me close this because we don't
382:04 - need it right now it's done
382:07 - fine
382:08 - now this is done
382:10 - now let me repeat this thing also here
382:13 - so
382:15 - let me wrap this in like so if like this
382:18 - too we will show the blue sign here so
382:23 - let me go to the react icons once more
382:27 - and
382:29 - copy one more
382:31 - icon for like but this time it will be
382:33 - filled so like
382:37 - okay which one should we use
382:39 - a I feel like let's try this
382:43 - will it work
382:45 - let's try
382:47 - okay
382:49 - and in here where
382:52 - so if the like this 2 we will show
382:56 - this icon with the size of 30 also
383:00 - add okay
383:02 - add them here
383:06 - fine click like here and this will turn
383:09 - to dark I mean this color click it again
383:13 - and the number will change and I mean
383:17 - number will decrease if you unlike and
383:19 - it will increase if you like also the
383:21 - color will change on the icon
383:23 - fine so do we have a color
383:26 - ah so let's make it as
383:29 - red
383:31 - click it and it becomes set but trade is
383:34 - too bright
383:36 - so let's make it as a heart
383:41 - like this and they should be
383:44 - just make ourselves just search hurt
383:46 - here
383:49 - so we need AI so just say AI
383:52 - will hurt sorry outline hurt
383:55 - and then
383:58 - we will have
383:59 - field heart
384:02 - so here we will have
384:05 - will hurt and the color will be red but
384:08 - here outlined but
384:11 - now check here click it becomes red and
384:14 - if you click it again it becomes
384:16 - outlined
384:17 - we can remove this P tag here
384:20 - and we will see only the like like this
384:24 - so is it proper let me check
384:29 - so click if you click if I click a post
384:32 - we don't see the number here which is
384:36 - the number here at the top
384:38 - so let me remove the likes count from
384:41 - here and just style it
384:43 - fine
384:44 - so click it again and if you refresh
384:46 - after clicking this will persist
384:50 - see it comes let me click post to like
384:53 - and if you refresh it will persist as
384:55 - well
384:57 - yes see it's persisting now
385:01 - let me come to the home page but in on
385:04 - the home page let me log out and
385:07 - let me log out and log in with the other
385:10 - account
385:12 - wait a second let me view profile let me
385:16 - log in with the other account
385:17 - so please say Nishan as 550 at the rate
385:21 - I mean one two three at the rate
385:23 - gmail.com one two three four five six
385:26 - seven sign in
385:29 - so here the like is different
385:33 - I mean the post 4 is here post three
385:36 - post one but in that other account we
385:39 - only like post four and I think post two
385:41 - so we can go back and check
385:44 - here we have post fourth one and two
385:46 - let's check here
385:48 - just to be sure
385:54 - one two three four five six seven
385:57 - here we have only post four and two so
385:59 - it's working perfectly I mean perfect
386:02 - now let's position this slides count
386:04 - somewhere so let me close this and this
386:08 - all we need is to make here so after
386:11 - this post
386:16 - so
386:17 - just say let's say we are having it just
386:20 - make it at the top then
386:22 - here
386:26 - okay likes count only like this
386:29 - so we need to arrange that
386:32 - so make it a P tag
386:38 - and wrap all of this energy
386:45 - now in this difficult like container we
386:47 - will need some styling for Flex
386:51 - so we already have flex and just say
386:53 - Flex Direction
386:55 - column
386:58 - then
386:59 - we need justify content Center not this
387:03 - because the whole structure of the page
387:05 - changes if you do that
387:07 - so
387:09 - now let's style the P tag here
387:13 - okay it's already styled but it's
387:15 - different p
387:17 - so
387:18 - okay
387:19 - let's add margin left
387:26 - 20px
387:28 - or 10 Also let's try
387:31 - 10.
387:34 - so we can say just like it says here in
387:37 - the LinkedIn two people like this it
387:41 - says
387:42 - U and 219 other likes it like this post
387:47 - so
387:50 - we can say just this
387:52 - this
387:54 - Mini
387:58 - people like this post save this and we
388:03 - will see this
388:05 - so I guess this should be 5 only
388:09 - it will work fine
388:11 - one people like this post okay
388:14 - let's remove many
388:16 - and if you click if you like the like
388:19 - count will increase
388:21 - so
388:22 - let me check the styling here
388:25 - so the font size is same
388:28 - font is size 12 pixels
388:32 - family same
388:33 - size is this
388:35 - then weight is 400
388:38 - then the color is
388:41 - this
388:45 - let me copy the color and just replace
388:47 - this rgba
388:48 - whatever we have here
388:50 - now let's check
388:52 - we are getting it as blue
388:55 - well it's not blue it's gray yes I can
388:58 - see that
388:59 - okay if you hovered it then it's blue
389:03 - so just remove this and let me invert
389:05 - this back
389:06 - but let's change it to a grayer version
389:09 - so just slide the Color Picker color
389:13 - now it's fine I guess
389:17 - so just make the font size as 13.
389:21 - yes
389:23 - fine so we have implemented the like
389:25 - system
389:27 - okay so the thing is we have the like
389:29 - like we have the like
389:32 - uh text here
389:34 - so in this div let's say one more P tag
389:37 - and it will say like
389:42 - so it's here
389:44 - fine
389:47 - okay
389:49 - in this div let's give it a class name
389:51 - of likes inner
389:55 - copy this class commode to index and in
389:59 - here this selects in Earth
390:01 - display of flex
390:04 - align item Center
390:08 - and we will have this like again let's
390:10 - add a p and add all of the stylings but
390:14 - make this as 16
390:16 - remove this
390:19 - and make this as 600.
390:21 - now we will have a like text here as
390:24 - well
390:25 - like this
390:27 - but the thing is
390:30 - one more thing we have to do the light
390:32 - if you have lagged the page I mean the
390:35 - post this text will be turned to Blue
390:39 - so we can also handle that
390:41 - so their class name here
390:45 - so if like is here it means so black
390:49 - sorry blue text
390:52 - else for black
390:56 - fine
390:57 - so in the blue one
390:59 - here let's do in the blue
391:02 - let's add this color that we had on the
391:05 - way we're getting
391:06 - this color
391:10 - so say color
391:12 - this but if we have black
391:20 - like
391:21 - we will show
391:23 - let's say
391:24 - which color
391:26 - this color
391:29 - save and Save
391:30 - let me click remove this
391:33 - so if it is liked we will show Blue
391:36 - but okay this should be here also this
391:39 - color should be on this like button also
391:43 - so just make it like this
391:45 - click it again
391:47 - the both will turn to zero I mean it
391:49 - will decrease
391:50 - so that's how we used like button here
391:54 - and we can also change the
391:57 - uh this here this should be 15 or 14
392:00 - also
392:02 - and I guess
392:07 - uh margin top
392:10 - minus 10 pixels
392:13 - okay not here
392:15 - just in this
392:17 - class
392:18 - or 20
392:21 - will work so also if you see we will
392:25 - have we have a heading tag here am I
392:28 - head not heading tag one HR
392:31 - between these two posts or two people
392:34 - like the post and the like button
392:37 - so we can
392:39 - just throw one HR here
392:43 - like this
392:45 - so it or we cannot see
392:48 - this HR I guess because we are having
392:53 - this
392:55 - so let's wrap it in a tape
393:03 - now we can see it
393:05 - fine
393:06 - so I don't know how to change the color
393:07 - of this HR but
393:10 - two people like this post in this p
393:13 - I mean let me see
393:15 - here we can do margin bottom
393:20 - sorry
393:21 - margin bottom minus 20.
393:25 - okay too much fine distance
393:27 - okay still too much zero
393:30 - too much let's say
393:34 - or five
393:37 - music video again
393:39 - okay which I am which on which I'm doing
393:42 - I guess remove this padding and see what
393:44 - happens
393:50 - okay if we are using this as
393:54 - but if you have the line items here also
393:57 - and this will make it in the center
393:59 - so where okay margin bottom should be
394:02 - here not here
394:04 - let's say minus 20 or 10.
394:07 - yes it's working or not I don't know
394:11 - what
394:13 - okay
394:15 - so let's make it as 5 only then see what
394:18 - happens
394:19 - then make this as 0.
394:23 - nothing will work so I guess that's fine
394:27 - fine
394:28 - if that's fine it's fine but something
394:31 - is still not right here
394:34 - margin top 20 this text should be
394:40 - not here I mean this should be on a
394:43 - little bit on the bottom
394:46 - from the top so margin top
394:49 - 10 pixels
394:52 - or c0
394:54 - okay I think that will break our design
394:56 - so let's leave it
394:59 - fine
395:01 - so I guess that's it for this section
395:04 - also
395:05 - okay if we remove this Leaf what happens
395:09 - I think that's happening because of this
395:11 - div
395:13 - so give this a class name of HR line
395:18 - so
395:20 - copy this class
395:22 - come to this page I mean this section
395:25 - called like container
395:30 - and say margin
395:32 - top minus
395:34 - 5px
395:36 - or 15
395:38 - yes I think okay sorry
395:41 - or 17
395:44 - yes now it's fine
395:46 - so how to change the color of this HR
395:48 - let's see this
395:51 - change
395:55 - the color
395:56 - of
396:00 - HR tag
396:03 - let's say let's say let's say let's say
396:06 - let's see let's see
396:07 - okay
396:10 - let's try WF schools
396:16 - HR
396:18 - new five
396:20 - okay let's
396:22 - add a color here
396:24 - I mean let's try this green color first
396:27 - then we will have an idea okay it's it
396:29 - works so I guess we don't need these two
396:33 - we need border top this and then let's
396:37 - see
396:39 - [Music]
396:40 - um
396:40 - what if you make a border only
396:43 - gets covering this okay guys if we
396:46 - target HR inside
396:48 - and then move the border right here
396:50 - okay that will change the color
396:52 - fine got it so we need to make it gray
396:55 - so just move it here
396:57 - and it's gray a little bit more on the
397:00 - white side
397:02 - but it's too much
397:04 - so move it now here and it's yes it
397:08 - looks great
397:09 - so now we have the like button if you
397:12 - click like the post will be liked if you
397:15 - click it again it will be unlocked
397:18 - fine
397:19 - so that's all for this section
397:22 - I mean the like button
397:27 - now let's work on the comments input I
397:30 - mean command system
397:31 - so
397:33 - we need to replace the name of like
397:34 - singer to likes
397:37 - comment inner
397:39 - like this
397:40 - so just copy this class
397:43 - and change it here as well so I mean
397:46 - like signal will be like comment inner
397:49 - fine
397:50 - now it is breaking
397:53 - so why it's breaking
397:55 - okay save it here as well yes now it's
397:57 - fine
397:58 - okay the same way we have this like
398:00 - comment in here
398:02 - make one more for the comment box
398:05 - so let me get to this Library called
398:09 - react icons again
398:12 - and
398:13 - add for comment
398:16 - add one for comment which is this AI

398:26 - which is this
398:27 - and Save
398:28 - we need to import this
398:34 - save and you will have this so make this
398:37 - as comment not like

401:31 - okay let's make it light a little bit
401:33 - light
401:36 - on the gray side
401:38 - so
401:41 - let's check this one
401:43 - yes it's gray
401:45 - now here we will make it slightly more
401:48 - darker
401:49 - to get it highlighted
401:52 - now if you click this
401:54 - we will see highlight option here
401:57 - let me Mark let me add or I think this
402:00 - should be not border this should be
402:01 - outline
402:03 - now let's check yes it's now perfect
402:07 - we can just move this to 10.
402:10 - to have this okay just like we have on
402:13 - LinkedIn
402:16 - find now we can type inside anything
402:18 - okay the thing is the text color we have
402:21 - to change as well
402:23 - so
402:24 - we can make color
402:26 - as this color
402:29 - I mean
402:30 - let's say
402:32 - let's try this color
402:37 - yes it's working
402:40 - let's also change the font here so tell
402:43 - me why let's add here
402:47 - or what if we just add it here
402:50 - okay
402:52 - so here also the color should be changed
402:53 - to this
402:56 - yes
402:57 - let me add font
403:00 - uh font size 16px
403:04 - yes it's better
403:06 - so if you make this 16px let's add the
403:09 - height to 40.
403:10 - yes
403:12 - now we can write a comment here okay now
403:15 - also we need a
403:17 - button here
403:19 - so we can add a button
403:22 - so we can just use one button that we
403:24 - already have
403:25 - which is called
403:27 - this button
403:28 - save button
403:30 - or we can create our own button here
403:34 - so just say
403:36 - button
403:38 - add
403:40 - comment now say when we will have a
403:42 - button here let's also sell the button
403:44 - here so say add
403:49 - comment BTN
403:53 - let me style this after this
403:56 - say
403:58 - let's say width should be of
404:01 - 200 pixels
404:03 - or maybe 100 let's try
404:06 - okay 150 what about this yes fine right
404:10 - 35px
404:13 - background color
404:16 - this color called Blue
404:18 - let's remove the outline
404:22 - now 10 will be none
404:25 - fine
404:26 - so yes outline is none
404:28 - also
404:30 - cuts are as pointer and one more thing
404:33 - is border as done as also
404:36 - the Border
404:40 - and none
404:43 - okay we have a button uh cool button
404:46 - also let me add water radius as 30 to
404:49 - make them rounded
404:52 - fine
404:54 - then let me add margin top a little bit
404:58 - let's say 20px will it work yes or 15
405:03 - then margin bottom
405:09 - also 15px
405:11 - yes
405:13 - fine it's working I mean it is here add
405:15 - comment button okay
405:18 - now
405:20 - this button is here okay what can we do
405:23 - we can wrap them in a fragment I will
405:26 - tell you why
405:28 - because these two things should be
405:30 - conditional
405:31 - I mean when we click the command only
405:34 - then this two should show up so let's
405:36 - create a state here
405:38 - it's a const
405:40 - show
405:42 - comment
405:43 - box
405:46 - and set
405:48 - so comment
405:51 - box
405:53 - used it let's make it false because
405:55 - initially we will not show them
405:58 - so let me add The Styling sorry this
406:01 - conditional here condition here
406:04 - if it is true only then show them else
406:07 - show an empty fragment
406:11 - so it's false that's why we cannot see
406:13 - it but if we change it to true we can
406:17 - see it so the show that it this function
406:21 - called set show comment box
406:23 - should be on this thing called uh like
406:27 - comments in its second div so say on
406:30 - click
406:32 - we can make this true true
406:36 - because if you see in the LinkedIn Let
406:38 - me refresh the page and try again
406:41 - so click it then we can see the comment
406:43 - box
406:45 - so here also we have comment if you
406:48 - click this we can see the comment box
406:50 - but if you click it again
406:52 - this doesn't hide
406:54 - so we can implement the same thing here
406:58 - okay
406:59 - find
407:00 - let's change the color of the comment
407:02 - there
407:03 - or when it is active
407:05 - so just say show command box then blue
407:09 - else black so refresh it once more
407:13 - so this is now black okay here also we
407:16 - can make
407:18 - ah okay they should be
407:24 - one second
407:25 - make it in the color
407:27 - crop so if this is true blue else show
407:31 - default or this color called two one two
407:35 - one
407:37 - two one
407:39 - add one hashtag S6 code
407:41 - now save
407:43 - click this
407:44 - it will be highlighted and fine that's
407:47 - done
407:48 - now let me get the comment from here so
407:52 - we can just say const
407:56 - comment and set
407:59 - comment so equals to use State let's add
408:02 - a string here
408:04 - now we need a function so say get
408:07 - comment
408:10 - I mean get comment from the input this
408:12 - will receive an event
408:14 - and get comment will be here on this
408:17 - input so
408:20 - on click
408:21 - this get comment let me add the name
408:25 - here called
408:27 - comment
408:29 - okay
408:31 - now if you need to store the comment in
408:34 - this that comment
408:36 - the set command will be event
408:39 - dot Target
408:41 - dot value
408:43 - fine
408:45 - okay that's done
408:47 - now we have the command now let me come
408:50 - over to this file in the vs code which
408:54 - is the I mean which is API file s.jsx
408:58 - so here we have this function so let me
409:00 - create one more function called export
409:02 - const
409:04 - comment
409:07 - like this so let me have this try catch
409:11 - block here as well
409:12 - we have try then we have catch
409:16 - that catches the error what's the error
409:19 - and CLG error
409:22 - now this post command will take the post
409:26 - ID that we have
409:28 - for the Post
409:30 - okay so let me pass it here in this
409:33 - function
409:34 - so they should take a post IDs
409:38 - wait a second not just the post ID it
409:41 - will take
409:42 - the post ID the comment and the time
409:46 - stamp of the post comment
409:49 - these three things
409:51 - so let's pass the data from here so
409:54 - first just let me import this post
409:58 - comment function
410:00 - and add it in one more function called
410:04 - say
410:05 - add comment
410:10 - here then just call this
410:13 - and pass
410:15 - the post ID
410:17 - of the post then whatever the next thing
410:20 - the comment which is this comment and
410:23 - the time stamp
410:24 - so the timestamp we can get from
410:27 - moment.js
410:28 - so let me go to helpers use movement
410:32 - and we can just cop we can just call
410:35 - this current I mean get current
410:37 - timestamp
410:39 - here
410:40 - so just to get current timestamp and add
410:43 - the format so let's make it Triple L
410:45 - like this just like we had on post
410:49 - I mean when we post a status or a post
410:53 - so this function will be called when we
410:56 - click the button here called on click
410:59 - like this now save this
411:02 - and we have this post comment here now
411:05 - come over here and the rest of the
411:07 - things will be done here and the first
411:09 - thing to do here is to import I mean to
411:12 - add the add doc function
411:15 - to add the document to the filed store
411:18 - but before that we need to create a
411:21 - collection for the comments
411:23 - so just like we have here so let's say
411:26 - let comment or comment shref equals to
411:30 - collection
411:32 - firestore comma
411:35 - uh let's say comments
411:39 - fine
411:40 - now we need this to pass I mean to pass
411:43 - it here
411:44 - in this add-off like comments ref
411:48 - then the next thing we need is the data
411:52 - so just add it using in curly brackets
411:55 - like this all these three things
411:57 - here
411:59 - fine just like we have in the
412:01 - get like by user sorry post like by I
412:05 - mean like post
412:06 - so fine it's done and I think that's all
412:09 - also
412:11 - let me close this when we are adding a
412:14 - comment
412:15 - this should be a then block after that
412:18 - and
412:21 - then we can just clear out the comment
412:25 - now this comment should be also as a
412:28 - value here
412:29 - so
412:30 - just add a value
412:32 - as comment
412:33 - now let's try this and see what happens
412:36 - I think let me open fired store
412:40 - from Firebase
412:42 - okay
412:47 - let's try I think it will work
412:50 - it will work so post ID will be having
412:53 - and comment and timestamp
412:58 - so let me add a comment here called
413:01 - this okay we cannot type here something
413:04 - is wrong
413:05 - add comment
413:07 - I mean get comment function is getting
413:10 - called
413:12 - and we're setting it here
413:14 - let me console this
413:18 - wait a second on change
413:20 - okay this should be not on click sorry
413:22 - on change
413:25 - so
413:26 - mistakes
413:29 - on change
413:33 - now let's try to write a comment called
413:37 - this is post one okay the thing is it's
413:41 - the color is very
413:43 - light here
413:45 - so drag the marker here
413:49 - and copy the color and add it here
413:53 - save
413:54 - let's also add it here
413:56 - I think that's fine now let's click add
413:59 - a comment
414:03 - so if you check here let's see what
414:05 - happens
414:10 - I think the command is not sent
414:14 - something is wrong so let me open the
414:16 - console and check what is wrong
414:23 - click add a comment okay
414:25 - get current timestamp is not defined
414:33 - where
414:35 - I think this is not defined because we
414:38 - haven't imported it yet
414:40 - so import
414:44 - get
414:45 - current
414:48 - timestamp
414:53 - just let me copy the import from
414:55 - somewhere
414:57 - for example from here
414:59 - this post update page
415:03 - so let me close and add this here
415:08 - now save and let's give it a try
415:11 - add a comment
415:12 - again the problem is cannot take
415:14 - properties up then
415:16 - line number 24 here
415:21 - okay I guess we can remove it from here
415:23 - and I mean remember then block and just
415:26 - set the set command as empty
415:29 - now let's try
415:32 - yes I think the comment has been sent
415:35 - because we don't see it here
415:37 - let's check the console in file store
415:41 - oh let me move the mic here yes now we
415:45 - have a comments collection and in this
415:48 - we have two comments
415:50 - okay this is first one and this is post
415:54 - one again let me delete this collection
415:56 - and try once more
416:02 - okay
416:03 - so let me add a command called
416:06 - this is comment
416:08 - one
416:09 - click add comment
416:11 - let's check here in the store
416:14 - firestore
416:17 - so we don't need this limit so close it
416:19 - because we have added the comment button
416:22 - here just like LinkedIn yes now we have
416:25 - this comment and we have post ID and the
416:28 - timestamp
416:30 - now all we have to do is show this
416:31 - comments here
416:33 - so we can add a function also one more
416:36 - called export
416:37 - const get
416:39 - comments
416:42 - here
416:43 - and also at try block here
416:46 - and a catch block
416:52 - so console.log
416:56 - better
416:58 - save this and
417:00 - just copy this I mean import the
417:02 - function here
417:03 - from
417:04 - the API file
417:06 - now we need the I mean we can have it
417:09 - here also
417:10 - and this function I mean get comments
417:14 - this will take a few things for example
417:17 - it will take
417:19 - the
417:21 - What will what it will take it will take
417:24 - the post ID
417:25 - so let's pass it here like this and
417:30 - so in this function let's also get it in
417:33 - the try block let me create a query to
417:36 - get the comments
417:38 - only for a single user or a single post
417:41 - so let's say let uh
417:43 - comment or
417:45 - single post
417:48 - query equals to
417:50 - let's add a query
417:52 - I mean this and add the
417:56 - time I mean at the mm reference for
417:59 - comments like this
418:01 - then we will have a wear
418:03 - and in where we will check if
418:06 - the post
418:07 - ID
418:08 - for the comment
418:10 - where
418:11 - comma
418:12 - double equals comma the post ID so if
418:16 - the post ID
418:18 - of
418:19 - The Collection or the document is equal
418:23 - to the post ID we are passing
418:25 - that will show the post ID for
418:29 - it which is a post ID for only the sync
418:32 - I am in the same post that we commented
418:34 - on
418:35 - fine
418:37 - okay now
418:39 - we have this reference now let me have
418:42 - one snapshot here so so snapshot
418:46 - or on Snapshot
418:48 - then
418:50 - we can just pass this query which is
418:53 - single post query and
418:57 - it will add it will show us a response
419:00 - through the response as callback
419:03 - and then we can just add
419:07 - comments or cons
419:10 - let's say
419:12 - comments equals to
419:15 - okay I think
419:17 - yes let's do it it's fine so comments
419:21 - response dot Docs
419:24 - and we have to map with rocks just like
419:27 - we do in every other snapshot like see
419:30 - like this we see here
419:33 - like this
419:34 - so I mean this for the current user this
419:38 - is this is for the single user
419:41 - okay
419:42 - so
419:44 - map so let's say it sends us a dock
419:47 - single dock
419:48 - and then
419:50 - we get the ID
419:53 - wait we have to return this so we can
419:56 - just say return
419:59 - and ID will be equal to
420:02 - doc dot ID
420:05 - comma then we will spread the data from
420:07 - the dock so dock I mean triple dots
420:10 - doc dot data
420:13 - like this and if you save this so we
420:16 - will have the comments in here in this
420:19 - comments for each post
420:22 - fine
420:23 - so we can try to console.log this here
420:25 - so we can do that also
420:27 - sorry this comments
420:30 - now
420:31 - we are calling it here get comments okay
420:34 - save this now let me open
420:37 - the our application
420:41 - okay
420:43 - so
420:45 - so we have the object
420:48 - which contains the comment and it says
420:51 - that this is the comment one
420:53 - okay
420:54 - now all we need to do is store this
420:56 - command in a state
420:59 - so let me create a state here called
421:02 - we have comment so let's say const
421:08 - comments and
421:10 - that comments
421:12 - so equals to use State and an array
421:16 - pass this set comments
421:19 - in this get comments
421:23 - come over here
421:26 - and let's get it
421:29 - then just set it here
421:31 - fine
421:33 - so our comments will be in the state
421:35 - called comments
421:37 - so all we need to do is map through the
421:39 - comments here so
421:41 - we can do it like this
421:43 - let me come over to the bottom
421:46 - okay let's do it here
421:49 - after the show comments box
421:51 - so we can just say or
421:53 - should we do it here or here let's try
421:56 - it here so comments
421:59 - dot length
422:01 - if it is more than zero only then we
422:03 - will show the comments
422:04 - so if it is more than 0 then we will map
422:07 - it
422:08 - so we can say comment or comments dot
422:11 - map
422:13 - then
422:15 - we will have a single comment from them
422:18 - and
422:19 - then we will return some things
422:23 - I mean some jsx
422:25 - so add a div here first
422:28 - and
422:30 - if there's no data we will show an empty
422:32 - fragment
422:36 - like this
422:37 - so in this div
422:39 - let's add
422:41 - 2p tags
422:43 - and here we can say comment dot comment
422:48 - also one more I mean other P tag will be
422:50 - for the timestamp
422:53 - so this should be
422:55 - let's say the name was time stamp I

430:03 - here no problem what is the problem with
430:05 - comment here
430:07 - do we have
430:10 - okay fine so let's style them in this
430:13 - all comments
430:15 - let me copy the class
430:16 - we have it here
430:18 - make the line items as Center
430:21 - okay now they are in the center
430:24 - but the thing is
430:26 - okay what is the thing is the thing is
430:29 - the name should be on the top
430:32 - so let me comment out all of these
430:34 - things the name should be here of the
430:37 - person
430:38 - find now
430:40 - I mean the name is here like this
430:43 - then we have the comment
430:46 - here by but we don't see the timestamp
430:51 - okay
430:53 - so let me just
430:56 - copy this P or cut it and add it after
431:00 - name
431:01 - let's see what happens
431:03 - this is post okay we have to add it at
431:05 - the bottom of this name so
431:09 - Lex Direction
431:10 - column
431:12 - then justify content
431:15 - enter
431:16 - we don't need align items here for now
431:19 - fine this is post four okay let me
431:21 - delete all the comments and try again
431:23 - from the beginning
431:28 - so let's add this is
431:32 - comment one for the comment four
431:35 - or add the comment
431:38 - and the name is here with the comment
431:40 - okay so in all comments let's make
431:43 - the
431:45 - class of name
431:47 - so the name will be our color of black
431:51 - so 2 1 2 1 2 1.
431:54 - save we don't need the text and line so
431:57 - remove it so text decoration has none
432:01 - then font let's change to system UI
432:05 - and the name
432:07 - okay I think it's already here
432:10 - fine
432:11 - so the name is here
432:14 - and then we have the comment
432:16 - so also add
432:20 - this thing called
432:22 - what is it
432:24 - comment
432:28 - so
432:30 - here should be let's say the margin on
432:33 - the left
432:34 - 4px
432:39 - or 10
432:41 - yesterday is fine
432:42 - for us also margin top
432:47 - minus 10 pixels
432:50 - or seven
432:52 - five
432:54 - or even 0 will work will it work yes now
432:58 - it looks fine
432:59 - so we can make this a little bit more
433:02 - fine I mean more grid if we wrap or make
433:07 - the color of this background
433:08 - as Gray
433:11 - so now we will see this gray box here
433:14 - so water radius should be let's say 10
433:17 - pixels to make them rounded
433:20 - like this the current is too much so
433:22 - decrease the
433:24 - yes this now looks fine
433:27 - just like we have it here but it's much
433:29 - lighter I mean it's more lighter
433:32 - fine I think this is it
433:35 - and we have this
433:38 - okay yes we have the timestamp at the
433:40 - last I mean on the right so let's add it
433:43 - there
433:44 - so
433:45 - let me cut this and remove these things
433:48 - or just leave it for now let's write a P
433:51 - tag the timestamp will be here
433:54 - so we can wrap this in a div
434:00 - and then this one inner div as well
434:02 - now this div will be on the opposite
434:06 - ends
434:07 - okay
434:09 - so
434:10 - what to do
434:12 - we can remove this and try what happens
434:16 - align items we need then again
434:22 - okay what can we do is
434:24 - divide back the style in column
434:26 - and remove the tips
434:29 - here
434:31 - and this timestamp we will have some
434:34 - extra class
434:36 - so
434:37 - here we'll be having where here we will
434:39 - we will be having
434:41 - position as absolute
434:44 - right as
434:45 - then let's attend
434:50 - self
434:52 - okay if we are making right as 10 and
434:54 - this is absolute this should be relative
434:56 - so position
434:58 - relative so that this sticks Inside the
435:00 - Box
435:02 - then let's say top 10 also
435:07 - we will have this
435:09 - let me add one more comment here
435:11 - this is
435:13 - comment
435:15 - for again
435:16 - click add a comment and this will be
435:19 - here
435:19 - so let's add a gap between them I mean
435:22 - these two
435:24 - in this two
435:26 - what is this
435:28 - to comment boxes
435:30 - the margin
435:32 - 30 bits
435:34 - to Too Much 20
435:37 - so we only need the margin on the top
435:39 - and bottom
435:41 - so we can make this
435:43 - okay from this much I meant too much
435:46 - okay 10 and I think that's fine
435:49 - now we have a comment box as well where
435:52 - we can comment
435:53 - so then we can like and remove this
435:57 - let me add a comment here as well this
435:59 - will be called as this is a comment one
436:04 - on
436:06 - post one click add a comment and the
436:10 - comment will be here from I mean in my
436:13 - name
436:14 - like this
436:15 - now this name is here Nishan Kumar
436:18 - that's why we are getting this okay
436:23 - ahead of here we don't see the command
436:25 - find because the scope of the command is
436:27 - on the only the home on the home page
436:29 - wait a second no it's here as well
436:33 - so on post 4 that the Nissan Command 2
436:36 - made
436:38 - okay wait
436:40 - okay
436:42 - if we click Nishant command to
436:44 - this post
436:45 - 4 will open up
436:47 - because this is the only post this
436:49 - person has made
436:50 - and if you click comments we will see
436:53 - comments here and we can add comments
436:55 - from here as well so let's try
436:59 - this is comment or yet
437:03 - again
437:04 - now click add a comment and this will be
437:07 - here at the current time which is 108 pm
437:11 - now go to home page
437:13 - and see the comments here so we'll see
437:16 - three comments so that's a great feature
437:18 - that I just added
437:20 - then
437:22 - if you click this
437:24 - I mean this open this will open up with
437:26 - no comments if we have a comment it will
437:29 - show up
437:30 - fine
437:31 - now the last thing we did I mean we need
437:34 - to do is log out
437:36 - and when to improve
437:38 - the inputs that I promised to do in the
437:41 - previous video I mean section
437:44 - so what can we do is
437:47 - okay we are having this login component
437:51 - in this
437:52 - we have this input
437:56 - so it is called common input
438:00 - so let me search for this class
438:03 - so height is 20 pixels
438:06 - find
438:07 - let me remove the height from here
438:11 - so X once again login component here
438:15 - let me add style Here style prop
438:19 - so we will make the height as
438:22 - I mean height here
438:25 - as let's say 40
438:30 - if 40 is too much try 30.
438:34 - so that is here so they should be here
438:36 - as well
438:38 - yes okay what else
438:41 - let me open
438:43 - this
438:45 - s file okay not in the SAS it is it's in
438:48 - the integral.css common input
438:51 - so height is 20 okay margin
438:54 - we have to remove
438:56 - now it will work
438:57 - fine
438:58 - they may here also it will work so I
439:01 - guess we can name of child from here
439:03 - because that was not the issue that we
439:04 - were
439:05 - having it's much better now
439:08 - now let me sign in
439:12 - let's check the
439:13 - inputs
439:15 - for
439:16 - the profile
439:18 - page and profile edit card
439:25 - this is fine yes
439:27 - real profile edit this
439:29 - and the problem is here now
439:34 - so if you bring back margin top it works
439:36 - fine
439:39 - so I guess we can do it in the label
439:44 - we can have margin bottom as negative
439:47 - so where's the label components common
439:51 - profile edit
439:52 - here we have a label class
439:56 - I mean this level so just make margin
439:59 - bottom
440:01 - minus 20 pixels
440:03 - or 15
440:06 - fine I think that's fine and now it's
440:09 - not breaking
440:10 - so it's done
440:15 - now let's handle the image upload in
440:17 - Firebase
440:19 - so Firebase has a bucket or a storage we
440:22 - can say where we can upload images or
440:25 - other files
440:26 - so the first step to do that is go to
440:28 - storage here in Firebase
440:31 - now click the get started button here
440:35 - they can I mean we can start in test
440:36 - mode here okay starting so let's wait I
440:41 - will list difference this I mean take
440:43 - the blog this block is reference because
440:46 - I don't remember
440:47 - the exact steps to do that
440:50 - click next
440:53 - we need this click done and we will have
440:56 - our default bucket here where we can
440:58 - image I mean we can store the images
441:00 - meanwhile if you check the blog here we
441:03 - have to import this thing called storage
441:07 - where where is it one second
441:10 - yes see get storage from Firebase
441:13 - storage so import
441:19 - from
441:20 - Firebase
441:21 - slash storage
441:23 - so let me just add git storage
441:27 - like this
441:29 - and we will have to create
441:31 - a constant a variable for storage
441:34 - instance so
441:36 - storage
441:38 - equals to
441:40 - get storage
441:44 - that we just imported
441:46 - and in here we will pass the app
441:50 - like this
441:51 - now just export it here
441:54 - and we are done for this now the next
441:56 - step is
441:58 - to we have done the bucket thing I mean
442:01 - we have created a bucket
442:02 - fine now the next thing is to do that is
442:05 - go
442:06 - into this file called components
442:10 - common
442:11 - let's say profile edit
442:13 - here we will create
442:16 - okay it's loading here we will create
442:18 - this image icon type thing or let's say
442:22 - a button first
442:24 - so let me just let it load and then we
442:26 - will create I think it's compiling and
442:29 - optimizing dependency or something
442:32 - okay meanwhile let me explain the code
442:36 - here what is it so we need one reference
442:39 - fun download URL I mean git downloader
442:42 - and one upload bytes is available to
442:46 - upload the file
442:47 - Okay so we can also create a function
442:51 - like this can we also do but first
442:54 - uh okay so here we should create a
442:58 - button or an input
443:00 - so
443:03 - input and which would be of type file
443:10 - save and we will have our input here
443:14 - okay which way is this when this is edit
443:17 - page
443:18 - we don't need it here we need it in the
443:20 - profile card page
443:22 - the components
443:24 - or should we make it an edit page or
443:27 - here
443:31 - let's see
443:32 - okay let me see
443:34 - on LinkedIn we have on this page so
443:36 - common components common profile card
443:40 - here
443:41 - so we can make it here
443:44 - okay
443:46 - let's just uh make it in the profile
443:50 - card itself
443:51 - and we will have this
443:53 - we can click this to choose a file
443:56 - okay
443:57 - so
443:58 - this will send us a
444:01 - response I mean this input will send us
444:03 - a file if we upload a file so we can
444:05 - create a function let's say get image
444:11 - and this function will be on this so we
444:15 - can say on change
444:19 - this so it will send us an event
444:22 - and to get the image that we will have
444:25 - we can just do uh console not log
444:30 - event dot Target dot file
444:34 - I files
444:36 - so if you save now let's try this and
444:39 - see what happens
444:41 - open the console
444:43 - let me upload for an image file here
444:46 - for example
444:47 - let me have my image so it's in this
444:49 - folder I mean in this drive
444:53 - let's try this image
444:56 - yes so see we are having the file list
445:00 - so if you are uploading one file you can
445:02 - get it like this
445:03 - so now if you choose a file
445:06 - you will get the images data so let me
445:09 - do that
445:10 - see we are getting all of these items
445:12 - so we are having this event okay
445:16 - now let's store this
445:19 - event you know trigger dot files zero I
445:21 - mean the current file into a state so
445:23 - say
445:24 - uh
445:26 - current image
445:30 - Set current image
445:33 - equals to use state
445:35 - so it will be an object so make it
445:37 - object
445:38 - then simply
445:40 - store it here
445:42 - like this now let's check the
445:44 - documentation here and what we have
445:46 - so we need to create
445:48 - an API for this so in the API file okay
445:52 - wait a second
445:54 - okay yes in the API file let's make a
445:57 - let's say storage
446:02 - or let's say
446:04 - image
446:08 - upload Dot jsx
446:11 - so in here let's do our things that we
446:14 - need we need to store we need to import
446:16 - the storage from here just like we have
446:18 - here so let me show you
446:20 - in the fire store we are
446:23 - update we are just importing the fire
446:25 - extra from here so same way we have to
446:27 - import storage so import
446:30 - storage
446:32 - from Firebase config
446:34 - then we know we need these things also
446:36 - so these are
446:38 - import
446:39 - a few things that we will add so import
446:42 - these things from Firebase slash storage
446:45 - okay so these are called ref
446:48 - the reference to create a reference
446:51 - get download by your download URL to get
446:54 - the URL when we upload a file
446:56 - successfully and then upload by its
447:00 - reservable to upload the files
447:01 - successfully
447:03 - so we don't need this file so just close
447:05 - it okay then what we have is
447:08 - we need to add a function so let's say
447:10 - con export
447:13 - const let's say
447:15 - upload
447:17 - image
447:19 - like this
447:20 - so in here
447:22 - first of all we also need to create a
447:24 - ref I mean reference to the storage
447:26 - bucket so the say const
447:29 - storage
447:31 - or say let's add this for
447:34 - profile
447:36 - pics
447:38 - and in here we will use ref then we will
447:42 - pass the storage and the folder we will
447:45 - create a folder here
447:47 - so say add backticks and say files
447:51 - slash
447:52 - the name of the file
447:54 - so
447:57 - this should be done here
447:59 - I mean inside this because only then you
448:02 - can access the file name
448:03 - so we can just say
448:05 - file dot name and we will get the file
448:08 - from the parameter parameters
448:11 - okay that's done
448:13 - now the next step to do is just say
448:16 - upload tasks
448:18 - wait upload tasks
448:21 - okay we have to create the reference for
448:23 - this as well
448:24 - so let me do it here
448:27 - so const
448:29 - upload task so this will be the task
448:33 - that will complete our current image so
448:35 - we'll use upload bytes resumable
448:37 - and in here we will pass the reference
448:40 - which is called the profile pics
448:43 - just make this as Profile Pics ref
448:48 - pass it here
448:50 - and then the file that we are getting
448:52 - from parameter
448:53 - so we know in which in which folder to
448:58 - send our data I mean upload the file and
449:01 - what will be the I mean the task I mean
449:05 - which file to upload
449:06 - fine
449:07 - now we will have upload
449:10 - task this one that we created dot on
449:15 - that is mean that means that our fourth
449:19 - that means our image is uploading the
449:22 - state changed and if it changes I mean
449:26 - it's a param
449:28 - then we will add a snapshot
449:33 - not snapshot snapshot
449:36 - and in here the snapshot will contain
449:38 - the data of our image upload
449:41 - so first let's check the program so say
449:44 - const
449:46 - progress equals to
449:48 - let's
449:50 - do this I mean snapshot dot bytes
449:55 - transferred divided by snapshot dot
449:59 - total bytes this means that how many
450:03 - bytes are uploaded and how many noodle
450:05 - bytes so we can use this for a product
450:08 - bar
450:10 - and we have to multiply this by 100 with
450:12 - the
450:14 - okay we have to multiply this by the
450:17 - set progress percentage
450:20 - what is this
450:23 - okay
450:25 - okay let's leave it for now just wrap
450:27 - this in uh like we have to round the
450:30 - value so we can say
450:32 - math dot round
450:36 - find
450:40 - okay now if it now it's done now second
450:43 - thing we can do is the error so we have
450:46 - to catch them also
450:47 - the error
450:52 - and we can alert if any errors have any
450:54 - error happens
450:55 - so we say console dot error
451:02 - just add error
451:04 - find now the next thing to do is get the
451:08 - download URL if it succeeds
451:11 - so we can have an empty callback I mean
451:14 - the param will be empty
451:15 - and it and in this we will use this get
451:18 - download URL
451:20 - where we will pass the upload task
451:24 - dot snapshot
451:27 - dot ref
451:30 - so when it is done
451:32 - we will have a
451:34 - callback again so say then
451:38 - let's say response
451:40 - and in the response let's just okay
451:43 - let's just cancel the response to get
451:45 - the image URL
451:46 - if it succeeds
451:49 - now what else do we have we don't have
451:51 - anything so just save it
451:53 - we are not using the progress but we can
451:55 - use it later
451:58 - okay I don't know why is okay okay it's
452:01 - what it was hidden okay
452:03 - what we need to do is just multiply
452:06 - this switch with 100 to 500 percentage
452:11 - 100.
452:13 - then we can just say in the console
452:17 - so do this
452:19 - now let's give it a try
452:21 - and see what happens give it ready fresh
452:24 - first
452:27 - now click the let me go to the profile
452:30 - page view profile click upload file I
452:33 - will choose file
452:35 - let me choose a file here some I mean
452:37 - some good file let's try this
452:40 - now we have chosen this okay one second
452:43 - but the problem is we don't need this
452:46 - file
452:47 - okay one sec
452:50 - components common profile card index
452:56 - okay so the we are not running
453:00 - this okay we have to run the function
453:02 - also okay we are not running this
453:04 - sorry
453:06 - this things happen so import
453:10 - upload image
453:13 - from API file
453:15 - now let me create a
453:18 - functions the const
453:20 - let's say
453:22 - upload
453:24 - uh picture
453:29 - and if you want to change the name let's
453:31 - say upload images
453:34 - upload image API
453:38 - now just make this as upload image it
453:40 - will work
453:44 - fine
453:45 - in this we will call upload image API
453:48 - and we will pass this current file which
453:51 - is the current image
453:52 - like this so we need a button as well
453:55 - to trigger the upload so let's create it
453:58 - just a simple button for now so let's
454:00 - say
454:01 - upload
454:03 - now just copy the function name upload
454:05 - image and add the function name here
454:07 - it's on click upload image
454:10 - so it refresh the page once let's try
454:13 - from the beginning
454:14 - select a file
454:16 - let's say this file and click upload
454:23 - dependent Network tabs and let's see
454:25 - what are we getting
454:27 - we are getting nothing
454:29 - okay so let's check the storage
454:32 - and see what we having what are we
454:34 - having here
454:37 - okay we cannot upload an image for now
454:41 - so what might be the problem so let's
454:43 - try rules
454:49 - okay for killing upload the upload image
454:52 - function is running and it's passing the
454:54 - current image here
454:56 - which is the file
454:57 - it should work but it's not
455:01 - okay image upload okay now it's working
455:03 - okay the button was not clickable but
455:06 - so now we have this link so click the
455:09 - link and we will be on this we will have
455:12 - this image in the new tab and this is a
455:15 - link that we can store in the fire store
455:18 - now go to files and we will have a
455:21 - folder called files so let's make the
455:24 - folder to be
455:26 - profile
455:27 - images
455:29 - now if you will upload a file the folder
455:32 - name will change so let me delete
455:34 - this folder
455:37 - so let me go back
455:40 - this and just click this and delete
455:45 - now let me upload one more file here so
455:47 - I don't need we need the block for now
455:49 - so let's remove it
455:51 - Let me refresh the page
455:55 - let me upload another file so just go to
455:58 - choose a file
456:00 - let me see where we have or where I have
456:02 - my images
456:04 - stored
456:05 - so in this folder let's say this and
456:09 - then say this now let me upload this
456:13 - image
456:14 - the best image that I have
456:17 - Okay click upload here
456:23 - whatever we are saying the percentage of
456:26 - the image upload and if it reaches 100
456:29 - it will show us
456:31 - the link of the image that we have
456:34 - this is the image
456:36 - we can zoom this and zoom out
456:39 - now if you refresh this
456:41 - you will have the image here in this
456:43 - folder called profile images
456:46 - like this
456:47 - now
456:49 - we can use this URL that we are getting
456:52 - and
456:53 - add that URL to the profile picture as a
456:57 - profile picture so
457:01 - let me create or let me create a let's
457:05 - say what is it
457:07 - let me create a state here called
457:10 - uh image
457:14 - image link
457:17 - comma set image
457:19 - link equals to use state
457:23 - let's say a string we have to pass the
457:27 - state email link
457:28 - to this function
457:31 - I mean upload upload image API
457:37 - let's get it here
457:40 - and just store the uh
457:43 - image link here so we don't need the
457:45 - progress for now so let's remove it we
457:47 - can add a progress bar later
457:50 - so this contains our image link
457:53 - and
457:54 - we can do this also
457:56 - let me create a user Factor so say use
457:58 - effect
458:05 - and when this image link changes or we
458:08 - will get it when this we have it we will
458:12 - run a function to upload the database I
458:16 - mean the name so let me go to file
458:19 - explore database
458:21 - and in here we will have the users table
458:25 - see this table
458:27 - so whenever you upload a file the link
458:30 - will be sent to us then
458:32 - if the link is sent to us this user
458:34 - effective hook will run and we will
458:37 - store the image in the database as
458:40 - profile picture
458:41 - so open the firestore api.jsx let me
458:45 - have the file or the option I mean let's
458:47 - have
458:48 - to update the
458:51 - what is it to update the profile so
458:53 - where is it
458:55 - like post get like by wizard post
458:57 - comment
458:58 - post user data get single user
459:02 - okay I think this is it this is it
459:05 - let me search for this
459:07 - no it's add doc we need something with
459:09 - update dock where was it
459:12 - on Snapshot
459:14 - on Snapshot again
459:17 - post okay let's check edit profile
459:22 - okay where is the update dock let's
459:25 - check this search foot yes this is here
459:28 - edit profile
459:29 - so we need to get the function from
459:32 - quiet store
459:34 - so say edit profile function
459:37 - and when this is a factor hook runs we
459:40 - will just call the function
459:43 - so don't need this for now and this
459:45 - neither
459:47 - so we have to pass the user ID and the
459:49 - payload
459:50 - well in this function so the user ID is
459:52 - the ID of the user
459:55 - and
459:57 - the user ID is I think this no not this
460:02 - so let's say current user
460:04 - let's console this
460:09 - so
460:12 - okay wait a second
460:16 - what is the problem here
460:18 - function dock cannot be called with an
460:20 - empty path okay let's just comment it
460:22 - for now
460:23 - okay now we will get our
460:26 - object and in the object we have the ID
460:28 - of the user
460:30 - so we can just filter it out like this
460:33 - so we are on this user coordination
460:35 - Kumar so let's check
460:37 - this is a
460:39 - Nishant Kumar
460:41 - yes and the ID is W2 eec
460:45 - the same ID here if we pass the ID in
460:49 - this function called edit profile with
460:51 - the payload that will upload our file
460:55 - I mean the payload will be the file so
460:57 - just say the payload where is it let me
461:02 - clear this and image link
461:05 - so just send this in the edit profile
461:09 - when the image link changes
461:11 - this will be sent
461:13 - in the edit profile
461:14 - and it will come up here
461:17 - so let's try this
461:20 - okay
461:21 - invalid data
461:23 - [Music]
461:25 - let's refresh this
461:27 - what's the problem here
461:31 - user ID English address
461:38 - we are passing the ID in payload here we
461:40 - are passing the ID and the image Link in
461:43 - the edit profile
461:45 - so what is the problem here
461:47 - function dock cannot be called with an
461:49 - empty path
461:51 - okay the problem that we had is solved
461:54 - so what I mean is
461:56 - we are having this upload image that is
461:58 - running on the button click and inside
462:00 - we have upload image API that is upload
462:03 - image
462:04 - in here we are having this API and when
462:09 - the
462:10 - Filip load completes this will call this
462:13 - method called I mean function called
462:15 - edit profile coming from file API that
462:19 - up address updates the profile
462:21 - so it takes the ID and payload so we are
462:23 - passing the ID current user and the
462:25 - payload and we are passing from here as
462:28 - well
462:28 - I mean this ID and payload comes here
462:32 - then this function gets called and the
462:35 - ID and payload then goes here and it
462:38 - updates the profile
462:40 - so now let's try this let me choose a
462:42 - file here
462:44 - so any file let's try this file
462:48 - click upload
462:49 - and in some time our image will be
462:52 - uploaded and we will see a toast here
462:56 - so let's wait for it
463:00 - and see we are getting this profile has
463:02 - been updated and we have removed the
463:04 - setter functions from here
463:06 - we only need file and ID which we are
463:09 - passing from here
463:10 - now if you check this link here let me
463:13 - go to this link
463:16 - and we will see it here
463:19 - see this image that you uploaded
463:21 - fine now
463:24 - let's just cancel this and show the
463:27 - image here
463:28 - so
463:30 - if you okay where is the image so it's
463:33 - in this
463:34 - let's say this current profile or
463:37 - current user in any one of them so just
463:40 - console.log current user and check it
463:44 - here so we are having an object
463:49 - inside we will have the image link
463:52 - so just get it here
463:57 - like this save it and you will have the
463:59 - image link fine
464:01 - so now let me create one
464:03 - image tag here
464:06 - so where should this be
464:08 - okay let's it let's add in the profile
464:10 - info
464:12 - so
464:13 - the stiff contains our H3 and all so
464:16 - let's try here so the image or IMG SRC
464:21 - in here let's just add current
464:24 - user.imagelink
464:26 - and make the alt tag as uh
464:29 - just say
464:31 - profile image
464:36 - save and
464:38 - we will
464:39 - have the image but it is very big so we
464:42 - have to style them
464:44 - so let me add a
464:46 - class name called profile
464:50 - image
464:52 - so copy this class
464:54 - come over to the styling of the file
464:57 - and where is it I mean profile info in
465:01 - this let's add it here
465:06 - so
465:07 - here we will have width say 100 pixels
465:12 - Okay small let's try 300
465:16 - okay 300 or maybe 250. fine this is fine
465:20 - okay now border radius fifty percent to
465:24 - make them or make it rounded
465:26 - then we also need to add the height here
465:28 - so height say 250
465:32 - PX
465:33 - so now we have a
465:35 - circular but circular image here just
465:39 - like LinkedIn
465:40 - but let's make it 200.
465:45 - okay so we have this
465:48 - here
465:49 - so
465:50 - in this name I mean in the wait
465:54 - in the current
465:56 - I mean profile info
465:58 - we have this username
466:00 - let me give some margin top or even the
466:02 - margin top from here
466:05 - and we will have it like this fine don't
466:08 - worry we'll style other things like this
466:10 - image and upload image as well
466:13 - so what can we do now is
466:16 - where is the image that we just added
466:18 - okay let me add some border here around
466:21 - so let's say border
466:23 - 2px solid
466:26 - uh two one two one two one save and it
466:31 - will have a border so let's add some
466:32 - padding also control pixel
466:35 - pixels now this color of this border
466:37 - should be lighter
466:39 - so choose this and
466:41 - find now make it a little bit more light
466:44 - okay then make this padding to seven
466:49 - or even five
466:51 - now we have this image just like link it
466:53 - in
466:54 - fine but the border is
466:57 - getting it's fine it looks fine now we
467:01 - have the image as well
467:03 - now I think that's all for this section
467:06 - I mean we have uploaded image and we can
467:09 - see it
467:14 - now let's design our file upload model
467:18 - so what I mean is on LinkedIn if you
467:21 - click this we should see a model opening
467:24 - up
467:24 - so the same way we have to do it here
467:27 - let me create a component for modal
467:30 - so this will be
467:32 - um let's say file
467:34 - upload
467:37 - model
467:39 - this should have an index Dot jsx file
467:43 - and one for index Dot scss
467:48 - when the jsx I mean j6 file here
467:52 - let me make a function component and
467:54 - this should be
467:55 - pile
467:58 - upload model
468:00 - like this
468:02 - so we should get the model from the and
468:05 - design but first let me import
468:08 - this
468:11 - style pile I mean style sheet file
468:13 - index.css
468:16 - now let me choose this vertical centered
468:19 - model
468:21 - but for this
468:22 - we need to add two states but you know
468:25 - two states one state in the profile card
468:28 - which is called Model open
468:31 - fine
468:33 - now let me create this here
468:37 - just copy model
468:40 - into this model
468:42 - vertical centered model and add it here
468:45 - we need few things which is modal and
468:48 - button
468:49 - the button we need to create a custom
468:52 - footer so come over here and you will
468:55 - see a footer crop here in this
468:59 - wait in this customize footer model
469:03 - if you see here this will be like this
469:05 - so we had just added here
469:09 - we can remove two buttons like this
469:11 - button and this button
469:13 - we only need this button and remove the
469:17 - events from them
469:19 - now they should be model open
469:22 - set model open and this also
469:25 - now where to get all the three things as
469:27 - props
469:28 - so model open
469:30 - I mean two things not three things and
469:33 - set model open
469:35 - now let me return the component in the
469:37 - profile card
469:40 - so import
469:44 - file upload model
469:47 - let me just return it here
469:50 - and in here we can pass model open and
469:53 - set model open
470:03 - and save this
470:05 - and now what is this what is what if
470:09 - what what do we need okay let me move
470:12 - the input and the button from here to
470:15 - here
470:17 - wrap them in a div
470:22 - like this
470:24 - now we also need get image so let's also
470:27 - get it as props and
470:30 - the upload image
470:34 - so also get from also get it from props
470:37 - so we don't need the button
470:39 - this upload image will be here on this
470:42 - submit button so on click
470:47 - and let's change
470:49 - upload
470:51 - profile picture
470:55 - save this now save here also but
471:00 - we already have that so we also need to
471:03 - pass get image and set image
471:08 - I mean get image
471:10 - and upload image
471:13 - to set it and upload it now if you click
471:17 - here
471:18 - okay also I need to add this event
471:20 - called set model open on this profile
471:23 - picture card
471:26 - so
471:27 - on here it's on click
471:30 - when we click this
471:32 - they should open the model so set it to
471:34 - true
471:35 - so that we can see it on the screen
471:38 - now also on this class called profile
471:42 - image
471:43 - let me make cursor to be pointer
471:47 - here
471:51 - now save this and click this button and
471:54 - we will have vertical Center portal
471:57 - so we don't need this for now here let
471:59 - me check I mean change they should do
472:02 - this too
472:03 - add a
472:05 - profile
472:07 - image
472:08 - save and you will have it
472:11 - now let's Design This profile image
472:15 - selection button or input
472:18 - so we can add a label here
472:20 - and let's say add an
472:24 - image
472:25 - if
472:27 - now on the input we can give it a ID
472:31 - so let's say this is uh
472:34 - let's say image
472:39 - upload
472:41 - now this ID we have image upload we have
472:45 - to use it on the level also but as for
472:49 - so we have this label for the input so
472:52 - save this
472:53 - now if you click the add an image text
472:56 - this label the file selection pop-up
472:59 - will open up on Windows
473:01 - so we can make this as hidden so that we
473:04 - don't see it
473:06 - now let's style this label so say class
473:08 - name
473:09 - let's say
473:12 - upload
473:14 - between or something like that
473:16 - and this div okay leave this div if not
473:19 - leave this just write a class name here
473:22 - called
473:23 - uh image
473:25 - upload Main
473:28 - now come over to this
473:29 - CSS file here
473:31 - and set this as
473:33 - display Flex justify content Center
473:37 - and align items
473:40 - Center
473:42 - now we need some height let's say 80 or
473:45 - 60px will also work yes
473:48 - now let's add this level inside
473:52 - and in the label we can add border 1px
473:58 - solid let's say
474:02 - uh two one two and two one
474:06 - now I'll collect made of padding say 10
474:09 - pixels
474:11 - and we'll have a padding then cursor as
474:15 - pointer
474:16 - you will have add an image
474:19 - here let's say font
474:21 - family
474:23 - system
474:25 - UI
474:27 - okay I think that's already here
474:29 - now it's done
474:31 - we can put the image and we can upload
474:33 - it
474:35 - fine but the thing is
474:38 - a problem is here we should only upload
474:41 - an image when we have selected an image
474:44 - so let me pass one more thing here
474:46 - called the image
474:49 - I am in current image this
474:53 - so
474:55 - let me pass and get
474:58 - so we can add one P tag here as well
475:04 - that will show us our current image name
475:10 - so select a file any file
475:13 - and the name will be here
475:15 - so we should make the flex detection
475:20 - I mean Flex as
475:22 - X direction as column
475:24 - like this
475:26 - now give it ready fresh
475:31 - so if you click this we will see this
475:34 - then we can select the image but
475:36 - if you click or we can click the upload
475:39 - image upload profile picture without
475:41 - selecting any file and that will do what
475:44 - is make our images blank
475:47 - so we need to make the button as
475:49 - disabled
475:53 - if you do this nothing will I mean it
475:55 - will be disabled
475:56 - we need to only enable it when
475:59 - our
476:01 - file is here
476:03 - so this is the current image let's
476:04 - console this in the log
476:07 - yes so what we can do is we can just get
476:09 - the name from this so current image.name
476:12 - so initially this will be undefined but
476:15 - if you select an image
476:17 - this will be not undefined this will be
476:19 - like have a name so we can use this
476:22 - property to check for disabled
476:24 - so if the name exists we don't need to
476:27 - disable the button so make it false but
476:30 - if the name is undefined we can make it
476:32 - true
476:34 - so add an image here or let me start
476:37 - from the beginning
476:38 - refresh the page
476:41 - and select I will click the button add
476:45 - an image let me use an image here let's
476:48 - say let me use my image here
476:51 - this image
476:53 - now as soon as we click I mean add an
476:56 - image we can see this button as enabled
477:00 - fine so click upload an image and this
477:03 - will be uploaded
477:05 - also when we are uploading an image or
477:08 - when it is successful we can close the
477:10 - model
477:12 - so
477:13 - how can we do that is just sit
477:16 - the model open as false
477:20 - here
477:23 - or just just pass that model open
477:26 - here and come over to the upload image
477:30 - API
477:34 - right here
477:35 - upload image API note API just upload
477:38 - image
477:40 - so it is here okay this is the function
477:44 - name
477:45 - and we should get the
477:47 - save this we should get this that model
477:51 - open
477:52 - here
477:54 - save both files
477:56 - and
477:57 - here when we are uploading is done
478:00 - let me close the file
478:03 - so
478:05 - yes
478:07 - make this as false
478:09 - now we can try this once more
478:12 - okay
478:16 - so let me choose the file here any my
478:19 - any of my image
478:22 - so let's try
478:25 - this image
478:27 - now upload an image
478:29 - and it will not close until the
478:33 - upload file is done loading I mean image
478:36 - is done uploading
478:37 - so let's wait for it and see it has been
478:40 - changed
478:41 - also
478:43 - we can show the loading State here
478:46 - so
478:47 - let me create one state here also which
478:50 - is called const
478:53 - ant uh progress
478:56 - and set
478:58 - progress
479:00 - equals to use state
479:02 - a string okay not a string a number say
479:05 - zero pass the set progress in the upload
479:08 - image
479:09 - API
479:11 - and get it here at the top
479:14 - I mean from params then we can set the
479:18 - progress here
479:24 - so this will run every time our progress
479:26 - changes and it will set the progress
479:28 - now paths are progress in the file
479:31 - upload model
479:33 - as this
479:35 - and we don't need this
479:37 - let me get it here as the progress
479:40 - now we need a progress bar
479:42 - that will help us to show the progress
479:44 - of the
479:46 - pile upload so say check for Progress
479:48 - here we can use this progress
479:51 - from art design
479:52 - any progress so you can choose circular
479:55 - one or this one
479:58 - fine let me use this blue one
480:01 - so JavaScript
480:04 - we need these two
480:05 - so
480:06 - let me import progress and space from on
480:10 - to D
480:11 - progress commas please
480:16 - okay
480:17 - now we have to use it in the model say
480:22 - where should we use it let me open the
480:24 - model
480:25 - let me use it below the add an image
480:30 - say here
480:31 - so we only need one circular progress
480:35 - and the percentage will be this progress
480:41 - so it will be 0 initially yes so okay
480:44 - what if we remove the space here I think
480:46 - that is what we don't need
480:51 - basically wrap this in a div
480:56 - and
480:57 - add a class name called
481:00 - um
481:01 - progress
481:03 - bar
481:04 - now let me come over to styling file
481:07 - and here say
481:10 - product bar padding 20 pixels
481:13 - okay I told I think we have to make the
481:16 - height as Auto then
481:17 - yes now it's perfect
481:20 - but if we remove this okay it's fine
481:23 - let's leave it
481:24 - so we don't need to see this progress
481:27 - when the product is zero
481:29 - so we can create a condition here so if
481:32 - progress is
481:33 - 0
481:35 - nothing or an empty fragment else show
481:39 - this div
481:40 - now let's try this add an image let's
481:43 - try to add an image here
481:47 - let me choose this image
481:51 - click upload a name upload profile
481:53 - picture
481:55 - and we will see this progress bar here
481:58 - and when the upload completes the model
482:01 - will be opened as I closed and the
482:03 - profile picture will be here with the
482:05 - toast here
482:07 - so that's done
482:08 - so this is done yes now what I have to
482:12 - do is see this image is not looking good
482:14 - I mean it's
482:16 - not perfect
482:18 - so let's make it perfect so come to
482:20 - profile card.jsx
482:24 - and
482:26 - also close this yes
482:29 - open the index
482:30 - so here we have the profile image width
482:33 - and height
482:35 - so we need one property called object
482:37 - fit has contained
482:40 - so that it contains our image like this
482:43 - one more thing that I forgot to when we
482:45 - upload an image
482:47 - we need to clear all of these things
482:50 - from here from the file upload model
482:53 - so we can come over to profile card here
482:55 - yes
482:57 - so
482:59 - upload image when it is done
483:02 - so how to clear them
483:05 - okay where are the date with data
483:09 - if we close this
483:12 - and open it again
483:14 - let's
483:16 - do what okay
483:18 - we need to clear the name first so let's
483:20 - do that
483:22 - I mean Set current image to an empty
483:25 - object like this
483:27 - so we can pass this here as well
483:31 - that current image that we can set as
483:34 - empty
483:35 - so save this come over to the API slash
483:39 - image upload let me get
483:42 - this that current image and then just
483:47 - set it as empty object
483:50 - and I think that's all
483:54 - okay so fine I think that's all for now
483:58 - in this section now we can upload an
484:00 - image and see this image here
484:03 - so let me upload my image one more image
484:05 - here and then
484:08 - now
484:09 - when we upload an image Okay click
484:12 - upload image
484:13 - and again we will see this product bar
484:17 - and it's done and the model will be
484:20 - closed so click it again
484:22 - and the name will be not here
484:25 - so one more thing yes I can do is
484:28 - hit the progress to zero
484:31 - so where is the progress
484:34 - say that progress as 0
484:37 - fine and that's all for now let me try
484:41 - one more
484:42 - this last image
484:44 - just to show you what happens now
484:47 - I have set the providers to zero it
484:49 - means
484:50 - the progress bar will be hidden
484:52 - so which image should I upload now
484:55 - let me try this image
484:58 - upload profile picture
485:01 - so it's getting uploaded
485:03 - and it's done
485:04 - it will be here momentarily like this
485:07 - now it will be an empty
485:09 - model
485:11 - now let's add the small icons or profile
485:15 - pictures at the place of your post for
485:18 - example
485:24 - Command 2 has one image this so we need
485:28 - to add these icons at the place of the
485:31 - post
485:32 - so what we can do is just come over to
485:35 - this file called API
485:38 - and create one more function
485:42 - so just like we have great status
485:44 - we have to create one more call get
485:48 - users
485:50 - sorry export
485:52 - const
485:54 - users or get users
486:00 - what's happening let's say get all users
486:04 - yes
486:06 - so let me just have this here
486:09 - just to copy this let me copy this on
486:11 - Snapchat function
486:13 - and we will replace the posts ref with
486:15 - either user if
486:18 - and
486:19 - we need to add one state here called get
486:22 - all
486:23 - users sorry not here
486:26 - okay
486:27 - this would be here yes get old users
486:31 - so
486:34 - they should be set to all users
486:36 - and let me get from the parameters
486:40 - now let me call this function
486:42 - in the index.js file we have where we
486:44 - have all the posts
486:46 - so we can just copy I mean just import
486:48 - it from here and we can call it here in
486:52 - this use memo so when it when the page
486:55 - loads this function will run
486:57 - now what we need to do is just say I
487:00 - will create a state called let's say
487:03 - all users and
487:06 - set all users
487:08 - so it's use date
487:10 - this will be an array
487:13 - let me send this set all users to this
487:16 - function and it will be automatically
487:18 - set
487:19 - now we need to check the all users here
487:21 - first
487:23 - save this
487:24 - let me open the console
487:27 - okay
487:28 - so we are getting an array
487:31 - so each array
487:33 - is the user and it has some image link
487:36 - for example
487:38 - this user called nishanth where is it
487:41 - the name Nishant comma 2 it has a link
487:44 - I mean this link image link
487:46 - similarly this user another user
487:49 - nishanth Kumar has the image link
487:52 - so let me get the link from here using
487:54 - filter function so we can say all users
487:58 - not fill all user filter
487:59 - it will take an item
488:02 - and this way we'll compare the item.id
488:05 - so we'll compare the ID of the user so
488:09 - if we make a change I mean if we update
488:12 - a status that ID will be stored here
488:15 - so let me also do that I mean we have to
488:17 - change there a little bit in post update
488:21 - so here the user ID should be not
488:24 - current user dot user ID
488:26 - this should be ID
488:28 - so that if you make a post let's say
488:31 - post three
488:33 - click post
488:35 - so it's here post three and if you see
488:37 - in the posts
488:39 - where is it post one post three this
488:43 - user ID is starting from R8 something
488:46 - and
488:48 - this is the ID that we have
488:50 - yes so we are on this user called
488:52 - nishanth
488:53 - Kumar 2 yes we are on this user that is
488:58 - why this ID is getting stored inside
488:59 - this current post
489:02 - yes wait what was the post this post
489:06 - okay
489:07 - come back to this component called posts
489:11 - card so we'll compare the ID of the user
489:16 - which is this ID
489:19 - okay I think we should be user
489:22 - okay no not in this
489:24 - so
489:26 - vertical what we can do is just say item
489:29 - id dot post
489:32 - I mean posts Dot post
489:35 - ID
489:37 - wait a second no user ID here also
489:42 - so user ID now save this and let's check
489:46 - the let's check in the console what we
489:48 - are getting so let me give it a refresh
489:52 - so we're getting an empty
489:54 - array so I mean we are not getting empty
489:56 - ideas we are getting the added with
489:58 - objects as well
489:59 - so
490:01 - now
490:02 - what we can do is just map through this
490:04 - array so map
490:07 - let's say another item it will take as
490:08 - param
490:09 - and simply we can return item dot image
490:13 - link
490:16 - save this and we will have an array
490:18 - which will contain the image links
490:21 - so we can access the links using
490:24 - zeroth index like this
490:27 - and we will have that
490:29 - now let me just use this in this image
490:32 - tag but first
490:34 - let me create it do not worry I will
490:37 - explain what is happening here so image
490:40 - SRC
490:41 - this
490:44 - let me close this let me add one alt tab
490:47 - alt tag they should say
490:51 - profile I mean not profile
490:54 - say yes profile
490:56 - image now save this
490:59 - and we will see that we have the images
491:01 - here for the user so let me give a class
491:04 - name here called
491:06 - post
491:09 - image now copy the class
491:13 - and come over to this CSS or scss file
491:16 - and let me add the styling
491:20 - so this would be width
491:22 - for T pick cells
491:26 - yes so C
491:28 - Nishant Kumar let me convert to this
491:30 - file
491:31 - so we are comparing the item ID
491:33 - from the item in the all users basically
491:37 - what you mean is
491:39 - all users we have we are getting the
491:41 - user's ID for example Nishant Kumar this
491:44 - idea I mean this user and this user so
491:47 - we're getting these IDs and we're
491:49 - comparing them with post ID
491:51 - so when we make a post we are sending
491:53 - the user ID to that post
491:56 - so it can machine scene here
491:58 - this user ID that we're sending so if
492:01 - they're both equal only then we will say
492:04 - oh I will we will show that image which
492:06 - is the image link that is why each item
492:09 - is getting their own image from profile
492:13 - fine so if we doesn't have any image it
492:16 - will show us a blank image
492:18 - so I will get that too later
492:21 - now let me just
492:23 - style this image so border radius
492:27 - let's say 50 percent
492:30 - okay object fit
492:33 - contain
492:35 - okay let me also add height say 40 PX
492:39 - yes they are here but we need to add it
492:44 - just before the username called Nishant
492:47 - Kumar or Nissan command 2. so let me
492:50 - wrap them in a div
492:51 - user and the image His image
492:56 - now give this a class name of
492:58 - uh
493:00 - user image or say
493:05 - post image
493:10 - wrapper
493:12 - now let me copy this class
493:14 - come over here
493:17 - and in here we can just say display
493:21 - of flex
493:23 - now that side by side okay what if we
493:25 - move
493:27 - this
493:28 - okay that will break the I mean it will
493:30 - not break
493:31 - it will not be proper so what if you
493:34 - make it as cover
493:36 - okay cover also works but it is
493:38 - pixelated
493:40 - so we have the image but the problem is
493:42 - the image quality is too much for this
493:43 - to hold
493:45 - so that is why
493:46 - so
493:48 - it's fine then I guess
493:50 - then in the post image wrapper
493:53 - where is it where is it here let's add
493:56 - padding of 20 pixels
493:59 - and gap of
494:03 - 20 also
494:05 - to add a gap between them but one is too
494:06 - fine too much then
494:08 - it should be 10 as well
494:11 - or 15
494:13 - 15 is fine
494:15 - okay so we have nishanth Command 2 I
494:18 - mean the name and the profile image so
494:20 - let me check on LinkedIn
494:22 - how is it on LinkedIn
494:26 - let me go to home page
494:31 - so
494:32 - user here is here
494:35 - fine
494:37 - I mean this user is here then his
494:42 - about so we can also show the about of
494:45 - the user here
494:47 - so in this case do we have margin on
494:49 - this name
494:51 - okay margin is 10 so make it seven
494:54 - or even 0 will work
494:57 - fine so I don't think we need this to
495:00 - remove this underline text
495:02 - although we have it here
495:04 - so let me I have removed it fine
495:07 - okay now also remove the color just make
495:09 - it as
495:10 - this color called Black
495:13 - or even two one two one two one
495:17 - now it is here
495:20 - the font size should be 18 pixels
495:23 - yes now the second item we can add
495:26 - is the like
495:29 - we are adding timestamp
495:31 - let's add it here
495:33 - so after this P tag let's add timestamp
495:36 - but we need one more I mean let's make a
495:39 - fragment here and see what happens
495:42 - okay make a div we need to arrange them
495:46 - as Flex Direction column
495:49 - okay they have already arranged
495:51 - on their own
495:53 - so there should be zero as well
495:55 - so we can just remove this it will work
495:58 - fine okay it's not fine so I have the
496:01 - username and the timestamp and the post
496:04 - so let me change the post width and size
496:08 - so status
496:10 - is here
496:12 - so
496:13 - this should be bigger so make the post
496:16 - font size are 16 pixels
496:19 - or even 18
496:21 - is fine
496:22 - okay
496:24 - let me get
496:26 - other let me get I mean let me use a
496:28 - font called enter here
496:32 - and Save
496:33 - this will be fine let me also change a
496:36 - few fonts here and there
496:39 - for example in the like button let me

496:59 - okay this is now enter
497:02 - okay now the next thing we need is okay
497:05 - let me come over here
497:07 - to like index
497:09 - what else do we have here for zero I
497:12 - mean this text called zero people like
497:15 - this post
497:16 - where is it
497:18 - here so it is like container and in this
497:20 - we have P tag
497:22 - so let me check that as well
497:24 - like container
497:26 - okay
497:28 - what is the P tag inside
497:30 - we don't so we can add
497:33 - tear
497:34 - and say this
497:36 - okay do we have P tag here
497:39 - yes we had
497:42 - here
497:44 - now changed also
497:45 - fine also I think this is not looking

500:37 - then margin top
500:42 - 5px
500:45 - or 10

500:50 - so now we have the name
500:52 - of the user that commented

500:56 - the comment with the image here so we
500:59 - have the image and if you click the user
501:02 - the user page will open up like this
501:12 - now let's work on the edit and delete

501:21 - pencil and dress and we have SIMPLE
501:24 - spellings here
501:25 - so these are on the right side

501:35 - Flex to make them in single row and all
501:37 - very simple stuff
501:39 - if you hover them we will see the color
501:42 - of the background changing like this
501:44 - very simple okay
501:46 - now
501:48 - What will What need to happen is when we

501:52 - data to this posts page so this page is
501:56 - post update here
501:57 - I mean this page
501:59 - so let me create a function here
502:02 - const let's say get edit data
502:07 - like this
502:08 - and let me pass this function to a modal
502:12 - component
502:13 - wait a sec no in this posts card yes
502:17 - sorry let me pass it here like this
502:21 - okay
502:23 - now let me get it from here
502:26 - and add this method or function
502:30 - to the pencil so on click
502:35 - so you will have get edit data and let's
502:38 - pass the post that we have
502:41 - I mean
502:42 - this posts
502:44 - the current post that we click on
502:47 - fine
502:48 - so we can simply get it here
502:51 - I mean posts and check it in the console
502:55 - so open the console once
502:59 - let me read this and you will get this
503:01 - data so we need to get the status from
503:04 - here so we can just say status
503:07 - and if you click it again
503:09 - status will be here
503:11 - like this now we need to set this into
503:15 - set status
503:16 - so that it comes here so just set it
503:20 - now post one is here click it I mean
503:23 - click edit
503:25 - then click this and the data will be
503:28 - here so you can change it like this
503:30 - so fine now we also need to open the
503:33 - model when we click this just like we
503:35 - click it here and it opens
503:38 - so we have to set the model
503:41 - to open I mean set model open to so here
503:44 - also
503:46 - so do this here
503:47 - okay one okay we have to remove one
503:50 - extra curly bracket
503:51 - so let me click edit the model will open
503:54 - up with the post inside
503:57 - fine then click this hi this model will
504:00 - open up with a post data inside
504:03 - fine so
504:05 - but the problem is when we click it
504:07 - again I mean start a post this will not

504:10 - so when we close the post I mean sorry
504:14 - when we close the model when we have to
504:16 - when then we have to clear the status
504:19 - I mean this should be empty string again
504:22 - so set status will be empty like this
504:25 - so let's find where we are closing the
504:28 - model
504:29 - so we can just pass this as okay we are
504:33 - passing send status here
504:35 - to come to modal component
504:39 - here and set status
504:42 - will be false when the model is closed

504:49 - bracket
504:50 - and set this to false
504:52 - same thing we can do
504:55 - in here
505:00 - if now

505:53 - but if we are closing a model
505:56 - I mean we are clicking the button
505:58 - from here they should be false
506:02 - so just make this as

510:01 - update post
510:05 - this will be an arrow function
510:07 - we will get the ID here
510:09 - and also the status that we have to
510:12 - update
510:13 - I mean status update
510:15 - now let me call the function here in the
510:17 - post
510:18 - wait date post okay it will work
510:23 - so we are are we getting it from here
510:28 - now just call the function here
510:31 - and pass so we are having ID and status
510:36 - so
510:38 - in here we can just pass
510:40 - posts
510:41 - dot ID comma status
510:45 - here
510:46 - this will come up here
510:48 - and then we have to update the
510:51 - so first we will select which post to
510:54 - update
510:55 - so we can use dock keywords to say no
510:58 - doc
510:59 - yes we have to select the dock so say
511:01 - post to update
511:04 - equal to dock
511:06 - and it takes the first param as the
511:10 - which collection to update
511:13 - so it's I think
511:16 - Post Service
511:18 - fine then it takes the ID which is this
511:21 - ID and then the payload which is status
511:24 - that it
511:26 - okay not here just these two things
511:28 - first
511:29 - okay then we need update dock function
511:33 - and this will take the dock to update or
511:36 - update to dock
511:38 - what um what I have written update to
511:41 - update sorry dog to update
511:45 - and then the payload so the payload is
511:47 - simply status
511:50 - so then we can have then block here or
511:53 - even try catch block
511:55 - so let me trap I mean wrap this in try
511:58 - block
512:01 - and one more for catch that's a catch
512:04 - error
512:06 - let me add the toast or just console.log
512:10 - error for now
512:12 - we can give this a try and see what
512:14 - happens
512:16 - so let me edit this post so click edit
512:20 - and say hi again to click update
512:24 - we will have some error posts is not

514:25 - so we can't update or delete it so we
514:28 - have to make sure that also so come over
514:30 - here

514:47 - so let me control this as well
514:50 - so append the console
514:55 - so okay let me just control the current
514:59 - user first only
515:01 - so let me just
515:02 - we will get this
515:04 - so this is our email
515:07 - and this is our ID so let's try the IDS
515:12 - ID first
515:13 - so we'll get the current ID of the user
515:16 - now let me add the current post
515:22 - so this also has an ID
515:25 - I mean post ID one sec no user ID yes
515:28 - let me get from this
515:31 - so this is the user ID of this post I
515:34 - mean this post where we are having
515:37 - I mean any post
515:39 - what I mean is
515:40 - this post sorry dot post I mean post
515:43 - sort user ID
515:45 - is the ID of the post
515:47 - with the user made
515:49 - so let's say Nissan command to make the
515:52 - post so this ID is for Nishant Kumar 2.
515:55 - now we have to compare them both
515:58 - so
515:59 - in this
516:01 - here it will just make a
516:05 - we will make a conditional operator
516:08 - and we will check if the current ID
516:10 - is equal to post ID
516:12 - if it's true only then we will show
516:16 - this edit
516:18 - yes only then we will show
516:22 - the edit option and the late option so
516:24 - add a question mark add this else an
516:27 - empty fragment
516:29 - now save this and
516:31 - this is
516:33 - other account
516:35 - so we cannot see eight icon here but all
516:37 - of the other icons is here
516:40 - like you didn't delete that means that
516:43 - these are our posts so that's also works
516:47 - fine
516:48 - also okay not also okay now let me work
516:51 - on delete icon on delete post
516:54 - so let me create a function for delete
516:56 - as well so say export
516:59 - delete
517:02 - post
517:05 - so we will need a function called delete
517:07 - doc so is it imported yes delete dock we
517:11 - have it here
517:12 - so we have to make a dock to delete
517:15 - which document to delete
517:18 - let's make this two dock to delete
517:22 - which will take the post ref and the ID
517:25 - now let me just have delete talk
517:33 - wait
517:34 - delete
517:35 - doc so we don't need the status or
517:38 - anything we just need the ID
517:41 - so let me get ID from here
517:45 - this should be here okay now we have to
517:49 - get the function where we have delete
517:51 - icon I mean here so just let me get this
517:55 - here
517:56 - and on click
518:00 - we will add
518:02 - this and we will pass wait what is
518:06 - what I am doing and then we will pass
518:09 - the ID of the post and this will be
518:13 - posts.id
518:15 - or user ID
518:17 - no just the ID so don't use the ID
518:20 - fine so the ID will be passed around
518:23 - here
518:24 - and then it will lead the post
518:27 - okay
518:28 - let me also add one post message here in
518:32 - updating and deleting
518:34 - so this I mean this
518:38 - so just add it here
518:41 - uh post has been deleted
518:48 - and here
518:50 - has been updated
518:52 - post
518:56 - now save this
518:58 - let me delete this post first post
519:02 - so delete it and we don't see it here
519:05 - let me delete this I yet again too
519:09 - so delete it and we don't see it here
519:11 - anymore if you check
519:14 - this post won't be here
519:16 - so this is how delete works and we
519:19 - cannot delete the post that is not our
519:21 - like this post
519:23 - so that's how delete and edit Works in
519:26 - Firebase firestore now we can delete a
519:29 - post and update it
519:31 - so let me make this as I am nishanth
519:33 - command 2. and we will get post has been
519:36 - updated
519:40 - now let's create this profile card that
519:43 - we see on the home page which contains
519:45 - the name image in the bio
519:48 - I mean headline so we need to create a
519:51 - div here first in the post status Main
519:54 - so make a div
519:56 - give this a class name of post status
519:58 - because
519:59 - the same thing will be here I mean with
520:03 - yes but okay the same thing
520:07 - this is not the same thing let's try
520:09 - this class post status okay no this
520:13 - class let's try
520:15 - okay no no no no no no let me create our
520:18 - one our own class say
520:21 - uh let's say and the name will be user
520:26 - details details yes
520:31 - now let me come over here
520:33 - and we can just add
520:36 - the height as 550 PX
520:39 - sorry wait says 50px hide this uh height
520:43 - and these items yes just add them and we
520:48 - will have a yes we will have a card here
520:50 - like this but
520:52 - if you see the height is big for this so
520:54 - just make this as
520:56 - 200
520:58 - wait 200
521:01 - yes now it's little bit bigger but let's
521:05 - try 180
521:07 - yes I guess that's fine okay now in this
521:10 - card we're going to show the current
521:11 - detail of the user which is logged in
521:14 - so we have one state here I mean one
521:16 - prop here called current user that we
521:18 - are getting
521:19 - so we can just check it in the console
521:22 - then we can just map through the items
521:25 - in the object in this object
521:28 - which is current user
521:31 - so first is the name in the profile card
521:34 - on LinkedIn
521:35 - the add name so say
521:37 - current user
521:41 - dot name
521:43 - so we will see the name here then we
521:45 - have the headline so just let me copy
521:48 - this paste it and this will be called as
521:53 - head
521:55 - line
521:57 - headline is here
521:59 - now before that we have the image
522:02 - I'm in the picture so say image SRC
522:09 - let's add an early tag called
522:11 - uh
522:14 - let's say
522:15 - what is the name of the key here
522:18 - it is called
522:21 - what is the name image link yes so just
522:23 - add it here and
522:26 - current user
522:30 - dot image link save them the image will
522:33 - be here but it will be very very very
522:35 - very big so we have to cut it so the
522:38 - class name let's say
522:41 - uh user
522:44 - image
522:46 - or let's say let me just remove the
522:49 - class name
522:51 - in the user details let's add IMG tag
522:54 - and sub width as 100 PX
523:00 - so it said it has been shorted
523:03 - okay width is fine let's say border
523:06 - radius 50 percent to make it rounded
523:09 - so if we are making this we have to add
523:11 - the height also so say 100 PX
523:15 - okay
523:17 - then object fit let's say contain
523:21 - okay or cover what about cover yes cover
523:24 - is fine
523:26 - now we have all of these items
523:28 - we can make this height as Auto
523:31 - that it can May Fail automatically
523:33 - so it's fine now in this we need to add
523:37 - the items in the center so the display
523:38 - Flex
523:40 - Direction column to make the things the
523:44 - way it was
523:45 - I mean in a column then align items
523:48 - Center
523:51 - so these are in the center now
523:53 - so this image should have a margin top
523:55 - of let's say
523:59 - 30px
524:00 - yes so we have this just like this but
524:03 - the width is I think
524:05 - too big
524:07 - or we can add border
524:09 - one pH solid
524:13 - and
524:15 - let's say
524:18 - this
524:20 - but we cannot see it so what if we make
524:23 - it a little bit black see what happens
524:26 - okay leave it that limited leave it at
524:29 - that and say padding 10 pixels
524:34 - okay 10 is too much let's try five yes
524:38 - five is fine
524:39 - I think yes
524:41 - so we have this image and the name after
524:43 - this so let me design the name so
524:47 - if you check here
524:49 - okay let's make this class name as
524:52 - name
524:54 - now in here just let me add dot name
524:59 - Point weight
525:01 - say 600
525:03 - yes
525:05 - font family
525:07 - say system UI
525:11 - yes then what we have here is
525:14 - the headline so make this as headline
525:27 - then in the headline
525:30 - let me check okay let me just need the
525:32 - font
525:34 - I mean fun family yes
525:36 - also let me shift this to the top so
525:39 - margin top minus 20px
525:42 - okay 15.
525:45 - yes 15 is fine
525:47 - okay so we are rating this
525:50 - okay but the thing is if you check that
525:54 - this image is on the edge of the card
525:58 - okay
525:59 - so we can move it to the top so say
526:02 - margin let me name a margin of 30 or
526:04 - just make it minus 30.
526:06 - okay it goes up so here in this one we
526:11 - should say I mean we should make margin
526:12 - top as 50px
526:14 - or 100
526:16 - yes it's fine here
526:18 - so
526:19 - okay now let me move this a little bit
526:22 - called ftpx or
526:25 - 60
526:28 - yes I think that's fine
526:30 - yes it's fine so we have to remove these
526:34 - items
526:35 - and just make this as two
526:37 - or one
526:39 - yes I guess that looks
526:42 - fine
526:44 - but this is small at the image so make
526:46 - the width as 80 and height exactly it's
526:50 - hard to calculate the exact
526:53 - Dimensions so if we are doing this
526:55 - margin top should be 50
526:57 - or 40
526:58 - yes 40 is fine but it is very much small
527:02 - so only divided back to 100
527:04 - now this looks fine
527:05 - okay
527:06 - now we have this image at the top here
527:10 - k
527:12 - so what is okay one thing we have done
527:15 - okay let me also add the image here in
527:17 - the starter post card
527:19 - so we will have we have this button
527:23 - so before that let me just copy this
527:26 - image and add it here
527:30 - wait
527:32 - this image let me add it here okay let
527:35 - me give this the class name of
527:37 - post
527:39 - image
527:41 - and let's see what we get okay I don't
527:45 - want to I want I don't want you to to I
527:49 - don't want you to see this
527:51 - the positive H width say 100px
527:58 - okay
527:59 - this should not be here where is the
528:02 - rates in post status here they should be
528:06 - yes but but it is too much say 50.
528:10 - also height as 50.
528:13 - then let me also use these items called
528:16 - object fit and Border edit is 50 percent
528:21 - yes it's now centered I mean circular
528:24 - sorry
528:24 - okay what else do we need
528:27 - okay we have post status
528:31 - here image and the button
528:35 - so justify content enter align items
528:37 - okay
528:38 - so just let me make this as uh
528:42 - what is the name of the property
528:44 - space between
528:47 - okay if we are doing this so
528:50 - we have to decrease the width say 450 PX
528:55 - okay it will not
528:57 - so better to make padding 20px
529:01 - okay not padding like it's margin
529:06 - okay that also doesn't work so let's add
529:09 - margin here
529:10 - and here
529:16 - um
529:17 - or what if you make space evenly
529:20 - or space around
529:23 - hey
529:25 - wait a sec
529:26 - this is a
529:28 - post I mean open post model
529:31 - we are having margin 20 here
529:33 - let me remove this
529:35 - from here as well
529:37 - I think that's fine
529:40 - we can increase size of this image a
529:43 - little bit so say 50px
529:45 - to 60px
529:48 - yes but it is not looking
529:50 - five minutes kind of breaking
529:53 - so contain I mean it's not plugging it's
529:57 - pixelated
529:58 - because the image quality is too much to
530:00 - hold for the app
530:02 - so it will be fine if I upload a
530:04 - simple image so let me
530:06 - show you
530:08 - let me upload
530:10 - uh this image
530:13 - upload the whole picture
530:16 - it's getting uploaded
530:18 - done
530:22 - and it says profile picture has been
530:26 - successfully updated and this looks fine
530:28 - now I guess
530:29 - so in our data I mean in our profile
530:32 - pictures
530:33 - it has been updated
530:35 - okay
530:36 - so I think it looks like this
530:39 - not much but fine okay
530:41 - now one problem I have encountered if I
530:45 - click
530:46 - from here I mean let's say Nishan
530:48 - command was the current username
530:50 - if I click we will get all the data I
530:53 - mean all the posts for this data for
530:55 - this user but if I go from here
530:58 - we will not see any posts
531:00 - so let me come over to this component
531:03 - called let's say top bar
531:06 - is it this component
531:09 - wait let me check you know if I click
531:11 - this view profile button we have I think
531:14 - it's in profile pop-up
531:17 - where is it yes here
531:19 - so we have this
531:21 - uh button called
531:24 - what is the view profile yes
531:26 - so this should be not user ID this
531:29 - should be ID only because
531:32 - we have changed the key name from our
531:35 - from user ID to ID let me show you open
531:37 - the console in filed store
531:42 - let me show you what I mean
531:45 - so in the users
531:48 - we will have
531:49 - if I check this
531:51 - we will have ID as this
531:54 - so if we make this as ID it will be
531:56 - fixed
531:57 - so now let me check it here
531:59 - and
532:01 - let me go to home
532:03 - and click view profile and you will see
532:06 - the data here that we weren't sending
532:08 - previously
532:09 - so that was the problem that we just
532:11 - fixed make the user ID to ID
532:14 - now we have problem in our application
532:16 - that we will fix now so the name from I
532:19 - mean name for the current wizard is
532:21 - nishanth command 2. and the post is also
532:24 - done from here this current username
532:26 - but the name that we are having is from
532:29 - the posts collection not the user's
532:32 - collection
532:33 - so let me show you what I mean
532:35 - so if you check here
532:37 - we will have
532:39 - this we will have this post dot where's
532:42 - the name
532:44 - okay this is not the name where is the
532:46 - name this times yes username we have
532:48 - and this username is inside the post
532:52 - collection post collection
532:54 - so what will happen if if we change the
532:57 - name from Nishan command to Tunisian
533:00 - Kumar
533:01 - the name will be changed here but not
533:03 - the name from the posts so we have to
533:06 - show
533:07 - the name from the users table
533:10 - so we have this array here called all
533:12 - users
533:13 - so let me just try to console.log all
533:16 - users and then let's console the posts
533:21 - and if you go to the home page
533:24 - and open the console
533:27 - let's see the output so first on line 21
533:31 - we will have an array and it will
533:34 - contain the ID
533:36 - so each one has ID like this and this so
533:41 - we will use this ID to get the name
533:45 - for example we are adding this ID in
533:47 - post collection as well so let me show
533:49 - you
533:50 - so in posts let's say we have this user
533:53 - ID so we compare the ID of the user with
533:56 - this user ID and if it fetches only then
534:00 - we will show the name of the user that
534:03 - we have here
534:05 - so let's Implement that so we will just
534:08 - filter out through this all users so say
534:10 - filter
534:11 - let's say a user
534:13 - and then we will return user dot ID
534:18 - if it is equal to
534:20 - posts dot user ID
534:24 - so we will we are comparing the ID like
534:27 - five ways is whatever and this ID I mean
534:31 - with the ID of this so let's say
534:34 - this user W 2 e c c f
534:38 - is having the post
534:41 - so let me show you what post does this
534:43 - have yes let's say this post
534:46 - so the ID is same I mean this ID and the
534:48 - is ready
534:49 - so if this matches
534:52 - only then we'll map or you will get the
534:54 - data and show the output
534:58 - so
534:59 - let me just
535:01 - okay let me just go
535:03 - I mean get the zeroth element from here
535:07 - and give it a refresh so we don't need
535:09 - this post so remove it
535:12 - and then let's see what we get
535:14 - so we're getting all these items so let
535:16 - me just get the name from here
535:17 - coordination let's say the name
535:21 - save this
535:23 - we will have the name of the user that
535:25 - we have on currently
535:27 - now just copy the entire thing
535:31 - and just paste it at the place of
535:35 - post sort username
535:37 - and Save so both users will have the
535:41 - same name because we have changed it and
535:43 - now if you change it again let's say
535:47 - um
535:47 - wait
535:49 - just add a question mark here and let's
535:52 - see I'll give you a profile yes now it's
535:54 - working
535:55 - this allows us to get the undefined
535:58 - values and load the page I mean load the
536:01 - page even when the value is undefined
536:03 - initially
536:05 - now let me edit this is
536:09 - Okay click edit make this as 2
536:12 - and save so the name here will be saved
536:15 - as well in all the places
536:17 - okay
536:18 - now if you check LinkedIn we also have
536:21 - the headline here after the name so
536:24 - let's also add that
536:26 - just copy this I mean copy any P tag and
536:31 - just cut this here I mean copy here not
536:34 - cut and add it here
536:37 - so the name will be called as headline
536:40 - now we will have headlines here for the
536:42 - user
536:43 - and
536:45 - also okay we need a headline you know
536:48 - timestamp
536:49 - so changed it
536:51 - now let me come over to CSS file for
536:53 - this or scss
536:55 - and we will have status time step and
536:57 - all
536:58 - let me add the heading
537:00 - so let me check the style for this
537:03 - okay it's same as
537:06 - this time stamp
537:07 - but the font is little bit bigger I will
537:10 - make it little bit bigger
537:12 - so just let me copy all the item paste
537:15 - it here
537:16 - this will be here
537:17 - but font size will be of 14px and this
537:21 - looks much better
537:22 - also we can decrease the font Here Also
537:25 - let's say 10 okay I think that's fine
537:28 - also let me make this as 500
537:31 - and yes it looks much better
537:34 - what if we make this is
537:36 - 15 okay it's bigger make it 15.
537:41 - it's like it's I guess that's fine
537:43 - so we can do the same thing
537:46 - okay we are having these items so
537:49 - yes
537:51 - okay now let me log out from this user
537:54 - and login with other account
537:57 - to show you what we get in the
538:01 - let's say what we get in the home card
538:03 - home profile card sign in
538:07 - so we are seeing this headline here and
538:10 - the profile picture
538:12 - with the image of the current user here
538:18 - now let's work on the
538:20 - connections page that we see on LinkedIn
538:23 - so when we add a connection
538:25 - only those posts or yes those posts we
538:30 - can see in the home page no other post
538:32 - so one thing I have done here one change
538:35 - so when we are registering we have to
538:38 - send data to a collection called users
538:42 - so I am attaching one dummy image link
538:43 - so that our image or what I mean is
538:47 - our
538:49 - profile image is not like this
538:52 - so that's why we are doing it so it
538:55 - comes like this this image okay but we
538:58 - can change it if you go to web profile
539:00 - and this
539:02 - fine
539:03 - now let me come over to
539:07 - this component called
539:09 - layouts let me create a layout called
539:14 - not the folder a file
539:16 - called
539:18 - connection
539:20 - layout Dot jsx
539:23 - now we can just duplicate these items
539:25 - here
539:27 - and make this two okay let me create a
539:31 - page so in this
539:33 - I understand this in this Pages folder
539:35 - let me create
539:37 - connections
539:40 - Dot jsx
539:42 - so the same thing we have in the
539:45 - home.jsx will be in connections page but
539:49 - this component called home component
539:50 - will be
539:52 - uh replaced with connections so let me
539:54 - do that let me come out to component
539:57 - and create a file here called
539:59 - connections
540:02 - component Dot jsx
540:06 - in here we will do same thing
540:10 - okay yes let me create a functional
540:12 - component here
540:13 - and this will be here
540:15 - fine
540:17 - now we have to import okay we don't need
540:18 - home component we have to import this
540:21 - connections component in here
540:23 - so we can remove home component import
540:25 - and say
540:28 - connections component from the route
540:31 - and add it here
540:33 - now we have to import
540:35 - I mean we have to change the name
540:37 - of this to connections
540:40 - and then import this
540:43 - page to
540:45 - this layout so let me remove this and
540:48 - same port
540:50 - connections from Pages connection and we
540:53 - are done
540:54 - now come over to routes so we can just
540:57 - collapse this
540:59 - come over to routes
541:01 - and in here we will create one more
541:04 - layout
541:06 - so basically
541:07 - we have this icon so this is not profile
541:11 - so we can create one more for
541:14 - which is called let's say connections
541:17 - and
541:18 - we have to get this layout so we can
541:21 - close this
541:22 - okay we have to get this layout so let
541:24 - me import
541:26 - import connections
541:30 - what is the name connection
541:33 - layout
541:35 - okay I think we have to change the name
541:37 - yes it's not changed
541:39 - connection layout
541:42 - now if we type
541:44 - it will be here
541:45 - save this and this now this will be here
541:49 - on connections
541:51 - now you see this icon after home this is
541:55 - for connections so let me add the route
541:57 - there in components common top bar
542:00 - component here
542:03 - so
542:05 - go to Route this should be node profile
542:07 - it should be connections
542:10 - save and now if we click in the page it
542:13 - will be connections component seen here
542:16 - I mean visual layer
542:19 - so in this component
542:20 - we will do our stuff
542:22 - okay
542:24 - so
542:25 - just like the registered component do we
542:28 - have an sas where we can write our style
542:31 - link file so say
542:33 - connections
542:34 - Dot scss
542:37 - or connections component
542:43 - wait a sec okay yes so this should be
542:45 - not in pages
542:47 - connection component where it is here
542:50 - let me import this so import
542:54 - let me go to any component
542:57 - and get the folder name here
543:00 - and this will be just
543:02 - be known as connection
543:05 - component or connections component Dot
543:08 - scss
543:09 - so name the
543:11 - import air file now styling file is
543:13 - there and the jsx file
543:17 - now here we need to show all the users
543:20 - so let me get all the users so we can
543:23 - say import
543:24 - get all users
543:28 - okay what is the name so let me come
543:30 - over to
543:32 - API
543:37 - we had one function to get all the users
543:40 - I created it so we'll get all users this
543:47 - so get all users from
543:50 - API slash firestore API and wrap this
543:55 - because we have to export this like this
543:58 - now one use effect hook we need
544:02 - so that we can call this function
544:06 - and it takes only one param called set
544:09 - all users
544:10 - so we have to create a state and fade
544:12 - the set function return function in this
544:14 - so
544:15 - used it and then const users set users
544:24 - equals to use state
544:26 - let's say an array
544:27 - now pass this here
544:29 - okay and this will contain our data for
544:33 - the all the users
544:35 - so we will map through
544:37 - this users so the same users dot map
544:42 - user
544:45 - and we will return a component
544:48 - so we can just say this let me create a
544:52 - component
544:54 - here in common folder so say
544:57 - first a folder we need say
545:00 - all say just say what can we say
545:05 - um
545:08 - connected users
545:10 - let's say this
545:12 - and inside we can add a file called
545:15 - index.jsx
545:19 - so let me make this functional
545:22 - so this should be
545:23 - what is the name that I added connected
545:26 - users
545:31 - just added here fine
545:33 - so let me import the common component
545:36 - here called
545:38 - connected users
545:41 - and just we have to return
545:44 - this component
545:46 - like this
545:47 - now
545:51 - okay one sec I think we have to import
545:53 - let's do this yes
545:55 - now it will be fine
545:57 - now pass the users in here
546:00 - and we are reading this text four times
546:01 - because we have four users
546:03 - we just have to print the name and data
546:06 - from this so let me add a P tag here and
546:10 - then I will say user dot let me come out
546:13 - to fired store
546:15 - and same name first
546:18 - let me just add the name now
546:20 - we are saying the name and just one more
546:23 - I mean let's say two more one for
546:26 - headline
546:28 - and one for the image so let's leave the
546:31 - image for now
546:32 - because we will sell it later we are
546:35 - just focusing on the functionality
546:37 - so in this day give a class name of
546:40 - uh
546:44 - connections meet
546:46 - now let me copy a class this class
546:50 - and in here we can say in The Styling
546:52 - file display grid
546:56 - grid template columns
546:58 - Auto auto just save to autos
547:01 - fine
547:03 - now what we can do is we are having a
547:06 - div let me make this device
547:09 - grid
547:12 - child and we can use this class here as
547:15 - well
547:16 - so we can say grid child
547:19 - let me add Gap here
547:21 - 20 pixels between them
547:24 - in the great child let's add a border so
547:26 - border one PX solid
547:30 - let's say two one two one two one
547:34 - save
547:35 - okay something is wrong here
547:39 - okay I guess
547:41 - no nothing is wrong it's fine
547:45 - okay
547:46 - now we have to make the width of this to
547:49 - be equal so save it 100 PX let's try
547:54 - to a small 300
547:57 - okay 300 is fine
547:59 - now let me
548:01 - align them in the center so justify
548:03 - content Center
548:04 - they're aligned
548:06 - let me give margin top
548:08 - or align items Center yes
548:12 - then let me add a finite height here
548:15 - called
548:16 - 300 pixels as well okay it's too much
548:19 - 300
548:20 - yes fine
548:22 - here let me add padding 20ps
548:26 - okay
548:28 - here also
548:31 - yes okay
548:33 - let's say margin they should be not
548:35 - padding
548:38 - or we can also add padding a little bit
548:41 - called
548:42 - 10px
548:44 - okay it's breaking so what if we add
548:46 - margin here okay okay okay okay okay
548:50 - Gap let's attend
548:53 - or zero
548:54 - okay I guess it's fine
548:56 - make 10 okay this is fine yes
548:59 - so also we need to make the texture and
549:02 - Center to make the centered text like
549:04 - this
549:05 - now we have four users
549:08 - and also in here let's make cursor
549:11 - pointer so designing is done for now
549:14 - so we can close this component
549:16 - let me create a function here
549:18 - so sick const
549:20 - get
549:21 - current
549:23 - user
549:28 - and we will pass this function as props
549:32 - to this connected users
549:35 - let me get over let it let me get it
549:37 - over here and when we click this child
549:41 - it will send us the ID of the user that
549:44 - we are clicking on
549:45 - so we can say user
549:47 - dot ID simple
549:50 - is this idea or something else no it's
549:51 - ID I guess yes
549:53 - so we can get it here as parameter
549:58 - parameter so console.log
550:01 - ID let's try what will happen when we
550:03 - click any of the items on the screen any
550:07 - user
550:09 - so let me open the console
550:12 - click Nishant we are writing this ID for
550:15 - this user click this the ID is like this
550:18 - okay
550:19 - now
550:20 - we will focus on the same principle that
550:24 - we used when we are when we are having
550:27 - the like I mean add like so
550:31 - where is it like post the same way
550:34 - exactly the same I mean not exactly but
550:37 - fine
550:37 - so now let me just copy the entire
550:41 - function and make this as
550:43 - add connection
550:47 - so we don't need light for now so let me
550:50 - just leave the set dock
550:52 - so this will take the user ID and the
550:56 - target ID that which
550:59 - which connection we have to add so
551:02 - replace post ID with Target ID
551:06 - you also need to replace the difference
551:08 - so let me come over here and create one
551:11 - more reference called connections
551:15 - ref
551:16 - equals to collect
551:18 - collection keyword yes fired store comma
551:22 - the name so say connections
551:26 - now let me copy this function
551:29 - come here come over here and replace
551:32 - like surf with this
551:34 - let me add
551:36 - these two connection
551:38 - to add
551:40 - Now set doc will take connection to add
551:45 - ID
551:47 - we will also throw a toast when added we
551:50 - can I mean when the connection has been
551:52 - added so we can say
551:54 - connection
551:56 - added
551:58 - now save this let me import this
552:01 - function in the
552:03 - okay let's say where should we import
552:04 - this
552:06 - add connection we can add it here yes so
552:09 - let me import
552:10 - from firestore
552:13 - add connection
552:15 - so we can call this method here and as I
552:19 - said we need to pass two things
552:21 - so first is the current user ID
552:25 - so we can get it from props so let me
552:28 - come over to pages
552:31 - where we have a home page
552:33 - so connection okay home page let me come
552:36 - over to layouts
552:38 - you have home layout
552:39 - and here we are having my current user
552:41 - like this so same way we have this in
552:44 - connection layout
552:45 - so in connection
552:47 - connections page we are passing the
552:49 - current user so now let me come to
552:52 - connections page
552:54 - which is the pages folder here
552:55 - connection
552:57 - and here also we are getting the current
552:58 - user passing into connections component
553:02 - I mean here so we can just
553:05 - restructure this
553:07 - and now we will have the ID of the
553:09 - current user
553:11 - so first thing we have let me close this
553:15 - and the first thing we are passing the
553:17 - current user ID so say current user.id
553:22 - then simply this ID
553:24 - yeah we don't need control lock so
553:26 - remove it
553:27 - so now we can try this and see what
553:30 - happens
553:31 - okay I think everything is set Target ID
553:35 - and all so this set dock will create a
553:39 - collection with this ID I mean it will
553:42 - combine both the user ID and Target ID
553:46 - so click anyone let's say Nishant Kumar
553:49 - wait
553:56 - connection added
553:58 - if you refresh this
554:00 - let's see what we are getting here
554:07 - we have connections and inside we have
554:10 - two things Target ID and the user ID
554:14 - so the user ID is the user ID I mean let
554:17 - me show you come to users remember this
554:20 - starts from bw9
554:22 - so come to users
554:24 - this is the user ID bw9
554:27 - that we passed and the other thing we
554:30 - passed is the
554:32 - okay the other thing we passed is the
554:35 - target ID
554:36 - from the users so
554:39 - we have clicked Nissan command 2. so let
554:42 - me search for this
554:44 - Nishant Kumar 2 where is it
554:47 - where are you
554:49 - yes this is the Nishant comma 2 and it
554:52 - is r a t i
554:54 - so come over here back and this is r at
554:57 - ti so it takes the ID of the current
555:01 - user as your user ID
555:03 - and the ID of the user that we clicked
555:06 - upon that ID which is called Target ID
555:10 - now one thing I have to do here is C
555:14 - we have having all the connections here
555:16 - like this okay
555:18 - let me remove this other one
555:22 - okay we are having all these connections
555:25 - but we also have the fourth user which
555:28 - is my user I mean this is me I think
555:31 - this Nishant
555:34 - but we cannot add our own user it is not
555:38 - I mean it's not the not the proper use
555:42 - case it will be a bug so we have to fix
555:44 - it
555:45 - so
555:46 - in this
555:48 - we will compare if the user dot ID is
555:52 - equal to current user dot ID
555:56 - if this is true it means the user is our
556:00 - own
556:01 - we are the owner of this user card one
556:04 - second do we have user ID or something
556:06 - else no we have IDs if the user ID from
556:11 - here is match if the user ID from here
556:13 - matches the current ID
556:16 - which is our ID
556:19 - we will not show this
556:21 - so we can just say show an empty
556:24 - fragment
556:25 - when it is false
556:27 - okay
556:28 - one second there should be returned
556:31 - should be
556:32 - here I guess
556:34 - okay no wait we did a mistake
556:40 - um
556:41 - let me okay we have to just copy
556:46 - this and paste it here
556:50 - I mean return
556:52 - yes now we are not seeing
556:54 - Nishant Kumar which is our current
556:57 - which is our current user the user yes
557:01 - so that's done
557:03 - now we have to filter
557:06 - the connections here in the home page so
557:10 - that we see only those posts from the
557:13 - connections that we added so come over
557:15 - to this 5x4 dpa.j6
557:18 - so we also have a function for like I
557:20 - mean get likes so this get likes by user
557:23 - let me copy this
557:25 - and we will
557:27 - add it here so let me add this
557:30 - so we will place a few things for
557:32 - example let's say get connections
557:38 - so this will take the user ID and Target
557:40 - ID
557:42 - so let me remove these two for now set
557:45 - like then likes comment okay
557:47 - so we will compare the target ID with
557:51 - Target ID
557:52 - and inside is here already so same way
557:57 - that we had in the likes we will get all
557:59 - the
558:01 - connections so let me just
558:04 - check if is like this true or false like
558:06 - this
558:08 - so we don't need this remove it
558:10 - make the likes to connections let me
558:13 - change a few things here
558:16 - and this like slip will be connections
558:18 - ref
558:19 - connection ref and this will be
558:21 - connection query
558:27 - connections query let me pass the query
558:30 - here
558:32 - as like query okay now this connections
558:35 - we are just filtering through the
558:37 - response to get the actual data
558:40 - now we will choose if the if event one I
558:46 - mean
558:46 - even the I mean
558:50 - even if the first or one element has the
558:53 - user ID equal to like okay let me
558:57 - research connection
558:59 - so even if one user have the ID
559:03 - equal to connection.user ID I mean
559:07 - this so connection will have a user ID
559:10 - if this is true we will throw this as
559:13 - true so this should be is connected
559:18 - basically it means that the ID we are
559:21 - passing here the user ID is present here
559:24 - or not
559:25 - if it is present it means we are
559:27 - connected else we are not connected
559:30 - now let me get this get connected here
559:33 - so let's say um
559:36 - where can we call this
559:38 - so let's call this here
559:42 - I mean yes
559:44 - now let me
559:46 - let me create one more use effect hook
559:53 - so we will call this function every time
559:57 - when our ID I mean current ID and ID
560:01 - changes
560:02 - so one second connected users
560:05 - okay let's try this here and see what
560:08 - happens
560:09 - we need the I mean we need to use effect
560:11 - we already have it okay get connections
560:14 - so let me create one state here called
560:17 - uh cons is
560:19 - connected
560:22 - that
560:24 - is connected
560:27 - I think I have misplaced the spelling
560:29 - connected
560:31 - equals to
560:33 - U State say false initially
560:37 - now just pass
560:39 - this in git connections
560:41 - wait we also need to
560:44 - pass user ID and Target ID which is
560:47 - basically these two things
560:50 - so pass them here with set connected set
560:53 - is connected
560:54 - let me get it here
560:57 - and set it like this
561:00 - now this will be this will have if the
561:05 - user is connected or not
561:07 - now save and let me check
561:12 - so
561:14 - Let me refresh the page once
561:18 - Okay so
561:21 - we are not getting anything
561:24 - connect okay this we have done something
561:26 - wrong because
561:28 - they shouldn't be here they should be in
561:30 - the home page
561:32 - so let me go to the I mean this page
561:34 - called
561:36 - uh post card okay posts card I think
561:40 - here
561:42 - yes
561:45 - wait a second note here I think let me
561:47 - see where should I add this
561:49 - so where should we where should we add
561:52 - it
561:53 - um
561:54 - we should edit some place where we are
561:56 - having the profile cards
561:59 - so I think
562:01 - here we can edit yes here we have to add
562:03 - it
562:04 - so
562:06 - let me cut this function and add it here
562:12 - so it's connected we need to create I
562:14 - mean this state so just cut this also
562:17 - and
562:19 - add the state here
562:22 - fine
562:23 - now I think we are done at connection
562:27 - okay we have to import get connections
562:30 - from the firestore API so
562:34 - let me add this okay use effect is not
562:39 - defined
562:40 - basically okay use effect is not defined
562:43 - where yes
562:46 - so let me Define this
562:50 - fine
562:52 - okay it is not defined
562:55 - ID this ID so
562:57 - this is a target ID from Posts
563:00 - so how can we get it
563:02 - okay
563:03 - again I think we did it wrong
563:06 - we don't need to edit here we have to
563:09 - add this in the
563:10 - posts card
563:13 - where is it here so that we can get
563:16 - access to the ID of the current user and
563:19 - our ID
563:21 - so
563:22 - let me just add this here
563:24 - so
563:26 - okay
563:27 - we can we don't need this remove it okay
563:30 - now let me come over to the top and
563:33 - import the things that we add here like
563:35 - the state here
563:36 - just cut it
563:38 - and edit here
563:40 - so now other thing we need is the
563:44 - we don't need this we need the get
563:46 - connections keyword I mean the function
563:48 - name
563:48 - so let me copy function name and
563:51 - add it here
563:53 - save
563:54 - the user effect is not defined let's
563:56 - define it
563:59 - okay
564:01 - now we don't we don't have the current
564:04 - user.id okay we don't have it and okay
564:07 - we don't have this ID
564:09 - so instead we will have to pass the
564:13 - posts.id
564:16 - so or it's it user ID let me check in
564:19 - posts
564:22 - yes it's user ID
564:24 - so say posts dot user ID
564:30 - so this is r at something
564:32 - and do we have a connection with this
564:35 - yes we have it so we will see only this
564:39 - connection on the home page if it's if
564:41 - it is successful
564:42 - so it's connected is here we are passing
564:45 - this let's check
564:47 - so we're getting all these options like
564:49 - false false false false false
564:51 - but don't worry
564:53 - okay here we are having this okay we
564:56 - need to pass the post slot current ID
564:59 - here as well
565:00 - now we're getting mixed responses like
565:03 - true or false true false true false like
565:04 - this
565:05 - so
565:07 - disconnected I mean it's connected we
565:09 - have state here
565:11 - so now let me come over to this
565:14 - here let me
565:16 - okay we only need to show those posts
565:19 - where we have added the connections
565:23 - so how can we do that
565:25 - this div is
565:27 - okay let's say this entire div
565:31 - wait like button no here we can do it
565:35 - and that at the return at the parent
565:38 - return
565:39 - so if it's connected it's true it means
565:42 - we have connected to the connection I
565:46 - mean we have it's connected we have
565:49 - added him
565:50 - if it is true else
565:53 - we can just throw an empty fragment
565:57 - that means no we are not connected to
565:59 - that user
566:00 - so let me just collapse this div and
566:03 - after this diff add a empty fragment
566:06 - now save this and you will see that we
566:10 - are seeing the posts from only Nishant
566:12 - Kumar 2 like this no other posts
566:16 - so let's check the ID
566:19 - foreign
566:21 - so where is it this is Nishant Kumar yes
566:25 - this is it I think yes
566:26 - it's Nishan command two see the name the
566:30 - ID is rcti now come over to connections
566:34 - and the ID of Target is riti so only
566:38 - that we are seeing here
566:40 - now let me delete this uh what is it
566:43 - this document
566:45 - and we will see nothing here
566:47 - but here we will have these three
566:49 - connections so let's say we add Nishant
566:53 - Kumar this
566:54 - so it will be added now come to home
566:57 - page and we will see the post of only
567:00 - this user
567:01 - now one more thing is remaining so if we
567:03 - add a connection this connection name
567:05 - should be available in the connections
567:07 - page
567:08 - so we will do same thing that we did
567:11 - here in the uh which in this page called
567:14 - post I mean posts card
567:17 - so we will hide
567:19 - this connection when it is
567:21 - I mean we will hide the name connection
567:23 - when it's connected is false sorry if it
567:28 - is
567:29 - true or false
567:32 - yes if it is false
567:34 - no not false true
567:37 - sorry
567:38 - so now we can do this so we need what
567:42 - those things we need we need to get
567:43 - connections so let's get it here
567:46 - okay we also need the use effect hook so
567:50 - let me get it also
567:52 - add it here after this second use effect
567:55 - it takes the current user.id and
567:57 - posts.id
568:02 - okay
568:03 - current user.id okay I think in our case
568:07 - it is user.id
568:13 - but the thing is we are mapping the
568:15 - users from here
568:18 - so we won't be able to use the user ID
568:22 - outside the scope of this block this
568:25 - block so we have to again move this
568:29 - inside the connected users
568:31 - so where is it here
568:35 - so let me add this here
568:37 - and we will have the user ID
568:40 - so
568:42 - yes we will have the user ID and the git
568:44 - and the current user ID
568:48 - so
568:49 - user ID is this okay just let me make
568:52 - this as user ID
568:55 - and
568:57 - then we need this current user so we can
569:00 - just pass
569:01 - this
569:04 - I mean this we can pass where is it
569:07 - current user here
569:09 - so just pass it like this
569:11 - and we can get this from props
569:16 - so save
569:20 - one sec
569:23 - what happened
569:24 - okay I think we are passing I mean it's
569:27 - not getting passed properly
569:28 - now it will be fine so the things we
569:30 - have user which is the target ID
569:35 - then we have the current user our ID
569:39 - but does this have user.user ID or
569:42 - something else
569:44 - I think this is user.id not user ID so
569:47 - make this as ID and here as well
569:51 - okay use effect is not defined so we can
569:54 - Define this
569:56 - so let's say
569:58 - use effect
569:59 - if
570:01 - get connections is not defined so let's
570:03 - add it import
570:06 - get connections
570:12 - we have defined that is connected is not
570:14 - defined so also let me Define
570:16 - this
570:18 - let me remove it from here okay
570:21 - connect what is the name set is
570:23 - connected
570:24 - so add a state here
570:27 - const is
570:29 - connected
570:31 - set is connected
570:35 - plus the U state
570:39 - uh empty let's say and it's false
570:43 - Boolean value
570:44 - now
570:46 - this is connected we will have to filter
570:49 - through this
570:50 - so if it is true
570:52 - it means we don't have to show anything
570:54 - it means that we have already added the
570:57 - connection
570:58 - so
571:00 - we will not see Nishant Kumar here we
571:03 - are only seeing Mission comma 2 and
571:05 - Nishant
571:06 - now let me delete this
571:09 - document from here
571:11 - and if we delete this we will see the
571:14 - all the three connections here now let
571:16 - me click add on anyone say Nishant Kumar
571:19 - 2. this will be hidden from here
571:22 - and shown here with all the posts
571:26 - so that's how we added connections
571:29 - our main that's how we implemented
571:31 - connections
571:36 - now let's design the connections page in
571:38 - LinkedIn that we see I'm in this page
571:41 - we have button call connect and all so
571:44 - we can design this
571:46 - so we will have we need to use this
571:49 - component class name called I mean style
571:51 - called uh
571:53 - connections component so first of all we
571:56 - need to make one border on the
572:00 - connection main which is the parent
572:02 - element
572:03 - so
572:04 - make this as 10 as Gap and padding as 10
572:07 - as well also let me add margin as 30
572:10 - pixels
572:13 - 30 30 PX
572:17 - safe when it will be here let me just
572:20 - temporarily
572:22 - okay let me not this just make this as
572:24 - 200
572:25 - or 250
572:27 - yes I think that's fine the height to be
572:30 - 200.
572:33 - yes now this looks fine we also need to
572:36 - add an image here so in this connected
572:38 - users we can do that this component
572:42 - so add one image I mean IMG
572:47 - tag head Source let's say user dot uh
572:52 - image link
572:56 - and let's design this so in the grid
572:59 - child we will have image so width say
573:03 - 50px save them and here as well
573:07 - so images here
573:08 - but let's make it 70.
573:11 - okay much better
573:13 - then height 70 as well
573:19 - okay then border radius 60 50 percent
573:22 - to make them rounded
573:25 - then object fit cover
573:29 - okay now it's fine looking fine
573:32 - now let's change the color so
573:34 - I think let me give the class name here
573:37 - called name and in here let's say
573:43 - head
573:44 - line
573:46 - now save them both come over here and
573:49 - here say dot name
573:52 - and let me check the styling for all the
573:54 - items which is the name so I think
573:57 - font family should be system UI
574:01 - system
574:03 - UI
574:05 - font size make 16px
574:09 - font weight
574:13 - say 600
574:15 - okay I think that's fine
574:17 - now in the second one which is
574:19 - headline let's also add some styling
574:23 - so say
574:25 - margin top
574:27 - minus or say 0px
574:30 - or I think you have to use minus minus
574:32 - 20. or 15.
574:38 - yes I think that's fine then we have to
574:41 - add this also so copy this and paste
574:43 - this should be 15px and this should be
574:46 - 500 only
574:49 - okay 500
574:52 - or 400
574:54 - yes 500 is fine
574:56 - so we have the name and the headline
574:59 - with the image so image is Big so make
575:01 - this as 80 then
575:03 - here also
575:04 - also might be 90.
575:07 - and here as well 90 yes also we have
575:10 - some margin on the top on the image but
575:14 - we will not add margin top here I will
575:16 - add display of flex
575:18 - justify content Center align items
575:24 - Center
575:26 - then Flex direction is column
575:30 - now they're perfectly looking cards now
575:33 - let me change the color of the border so
575:35 - they should be BBB
575:40 - yes just copy this and add it here as
575:43 - well
575:45 - also we have some background color on
575:48 - this great child this is a background
575:49 - color
575:50 - let's say white smoke
575:53 - okay it's not here it's I think here
575:58 - in this class yes
576:00 - now it's here okay now what we have to
576:03 - do make the borders as correct so border
576:06 - radius say 10px
576:10 - and in the child also great child
576:14 - so we have this border radius okay now
576:18 - one thing one thing to notice is we have
576:19 - button was also here so let me add a
576:22 - button
576:24 - and this will be called as connect
576:29 - so we have button here
576:30 - called connect now let me come over to
576:33 - react icons okay let me just install I
576:36 - mean just style the button first
576:39 - so after the image or say at the last
576:41 - after headline
576:43 - save button
576:47 - and width as hundred percent
576:51 - yes
576:52 - and then
576:54 - let's say Max
576:56 - not Max say height
576:58 - should be 40px
577:00 - yes
577:02 - but the thing is the card will be have
577:04 - to a little bit bigger
577:07 - so make this as 250
577:09 - yes it's now big
577:10 - also
577:12 - let's add the button at the very bottom
577:14 - of the card so position absolute
577:18 - then bottom as
577:22 - 10 pixels so we're doing if we're doing
577:25 - this we have to make the parent of this
577:28 - to be relative so position as relative
577:31 - now it's here perfect
577:33 - so make the uh width to be 90 percent
577:36 - yes it works
577:38 - so if you are doing this
577:40 - let me make the height to be let's say
577:44 - 300.
577:47 - okay 300 pixels not three thousand
577:50 - yes now it looks better
577:53 - okay
577:54 - okay okay okay so the thing is
577:59 - what if remove I think let me remove
578:03 - justify content Center
578:05 - and simply add some margin called margin
578:07 - top called ftpx percent
578:11 - okay not here from the image
578:15 - margin top
578:17 - 50px
578:19 - now this looks better than before
578:23 - or does it so if you make this as 150
578:25 - and here also
578:27 - it's bigger so we have to make this 20.
578:30 - now this looks better than before
578:33 - so here make the cursor as pointer also
578:36 - now we have to style this so background
578:39 - color
578:40 - say white
578:42 - color as some this color so let me
578:45 - choose the color
578:46 - let me go over to what font and
578:50 - choose the color which is
578:52 - this color so add color here
578:55 - we also need border so make border 1px
578:58 - solid
578:59 - this color
579:01 - save it and this will be here
579:04 - okay
579:06 - so I think this should be not wait it's
579:09 - pure white
579:10 - what is this color then
579:13 - okay it's this should be white as well
579:15 - now they will blend in perfectly
579:17 - yes
579:18 - now let's design the font so font size
579:22 - 18px
579:25 - okay too much 16
579:27 - yes I think that's fine then font family
579:31 - system UI
579:34 - okay
579:35 - then
579:37 - border ideas
579:41 - to make it rounded like this also let me
579:43 - add margin top
579:47 - or the button so 20px
579:50 - maybe not margin top set only top
579:54 - 20 PX
579:56 - okay this breaks it then
579:59 - okay remove it
580:01 - so what is now what can we do yes we can
580:05 - do the hiding I mean make the height as
580:07 - the empty
580:09 - now it's perfect but if you mean 30 yes
580:12 - that's also fine
580:14 - okay now
580:16 - if you hover the button we will see this
580:19 - thing
580:21 - so
580:22 - let me close this if you hover you will
580:25 - see this highlight option so make it
580:27 - here as well so on the button
580:31 - we can say
580:35 - over and when we hover we need to change
580:39 - two things only the Border should be
580:42 - 2 pixels
580:45 - and they should be
580:48 - a little bit little bit Bluer not white
580:51 - so let me come out to blue and just make
580:54 - it like this
580:56 - okay it's not blue it's purple so let me
580:58 - copy this color instead
581:00 - and then we can
581:02 - Slide the marker on the lighter version
581:09 - okay note this let me save this
581:12 - yes
581:13 - so let me slide this like here
581:18 - I think
581:19 - which is the ideal light blue color I
581:22 - think this one
581:25 - no it's still too much so this
581:30 - still it's not better
581:33 - so what can we do
581:36 - let me
581:39 - if we scroll this it will become darker
581:43 - save this and now let's try
581:45 - this okay it's also dark
581:50 - so let me search for
581:54 - or let me do this instead
581:59 - yes the color is okay
582:02 - no it will not fit like that okay
582:06 - so say let me go to material.com
582:10 - and search for colors
582:12 - hopefully we'll add some color that we
582:14 - can use here
582:16 - color
582:19 - this is not color this is rating this is
582:22 - color
582:24 - so we need light blue
582:26 - so let me try this color
582:31 - now let's check
582:33 - yes it looks better now
582:36 - also
582:38 - we have to do font weight as 600 here
582:42 - now it will be
582:45 - bolder
582:46 - okay that's done now let me add one icon
582:49 - here in the button so come over to react
582:52 - icons
582:56 - let me close this
582:59 - I mean
583:00 - okay let's leave it let's search for add
583:03 - icon
583:04 - or add yes add icon so we can choose any
583:06 - one let's say this icon
583:09 - where I have to import it first
583:12 - so import
583:14 - this icon
583:16 - from react icons
583:19 - Flash
583:20 - air
583:21 - now just add the icon before the connect
583:25 - save this let's see the output
583:28 - so we will have an add icon here let me
583:31 - make the width remember sorry not fit
583:33 - size to be 30
583:36 - okay one day is fine yes now in the
583:38 - button
583:40 - we have to make display Flex
583:42 - justify content
583:46 - enter
583:48 - a line item Center
583:52 - to make all the items in the center and
583:56 - GAP as 10 pixels as well okay it works I
584:00 - mean it looks perfect
584:02 - okay we can close this then we can do
584:05 - this so this function that we are having
584:08 - on the div
584:09 - should not be here they should be on
584:11 - this button so add it here now if you
584:14 - click a button
584:15 - we will add the connection so let's try
584:17 - for this
584:19 - and edit and it will be here on the home
584:22 - page with its posts okay so that was
584:25 - how we used I mean yes how we designed
584:28 - the connections page here
584:34 - now let's create that search option in
584:36 - LinkedIn that we have
584:38 - first step is to do that is to create a
584:41 - component here in common folder called
584:44 - search
584:46 - okay or maybe search users
584:52 - so in this component we will have
584:54 - index.html or I mean not HTML j6 and one
584:59 - for styling so index
585:03 - Dot scss
585:05 - so make the jsx story functional
585:07 - component and then change the name to
585:09 - say search
585:12 - users
585:14 - now let me import this component here
585:17 - I mean sorry not here let me import The
585:20 - Styling here so index Dot scss now save
585:26 - okay now let me
585:28 - make this input here
585:31 - okay yes so input
585:34 - which will be empty but now so make the
585:36 - class name as let's say search
585:41 - or make a dip first
585:43 - or maybe just remove the search users
585:46 - and make an input like this
585:50 - and give this Dev a class name of
585:53 - search
585:55 - users now save now let me close search
585:59 - results for a while and let me import
586:01 - this component in our top bar
586:05 - so we can do it here so import
586:08 - search input or search users
586:12 - and okay let me create a state here the
586:15 - second
586:17 - is search
586:19 - and
586:22 - that is search
586:26 - let me make this as uh empty I mean
586:29 - fault value for now because we will not
586:32 - see search input basically in the I mean
586:35 - at the start
586:36 - so let me do this so when we click the
586:40 - search icon we should see I mean we
586:42 - should turn this state to true
586:45 - so where's the icon
586:46 - here it is
586:48 - on click
586:50 - uh let's say uh call back a function I
586:53 - mean make it to true true
586:56 - now we have to do same thing on this
587:00 - that assignment search users so let me
587:03 - just call the component here at the
587:05 - bottom
587:07 - let me let's say where should we call
587:09 - this
587:09 - let me call this here
587:13 - I mean search users so we'll see input
587:16 - here but the thing is we wanted to see
587:18 - this input when this is true
587:20 - so just wrap it and say if it is true
587:23 - then show this
587:25 - if it is false I mean this state show
587:28 - this div
587:31 - so edit and I guess we should see I mean
587:34 - we should move it out after this in
587:37 - LinkedIn image yes now click this we
587:40 - will see a input here
587:42 - but what if I mean we need uh I mean we
587:45 - have to pass the function set search
587:49 - set is search here as well
587:51 - to make it fall from this component so
587:54 - let me add it and get it from here
587:57 - now let me style this search input so we
588:00 - don't need this
588:01 - and let me come over here and copy
588:05 - search users
588:07 - and add it here and then say input
588:11 - inside that we will have the height for
588:14 - TPX
588:15 - too much say 30 that is fine
588:19 - with
588:20 - let's say 60 percent
588:22 - Okay small let's say 100
588:25 - or maybe I think height should be 100 as
588:28 - well here
588:29 - okay it's too much make it 50 then
588:32 - yes still too much 40 I think it's
588:35 - perfect now
588:37 - White
588:40 - look and then border one pH solid
588:46 - and say
588:48 - let's make the border to be BBB
588:52 - this
588:53 - so we will have border here so border
588:55 - radius uh 10 PX
588:58 - this is now rounded
589:00 - but the color should be changed as well
589:02 - so color should be
589:04 - so one two one two one
589:06 - now let me add padding left
589:08 - 10 pixels
589:10 - okay it looks fine but also we have to
589:13 - change the outline or basically make it
589:16 - none
589:18 - now if you do this we will not feel
589:20 - outline
589:22 - but we should have a Focus effect so
589:25 - input
589:27 - Focus
589:30 - link
589:34 - you will need only one not two then we
589:37 - will change the Border color
589:39 - to be slightly darker to make I mean
589:43 - Slide the marker down to make let's say
589:46 - seven zero seven zero seven zero
589:48 - now border will be changed now let me
589:51 - add a placeholder in the input so say
589:53 - Place folder
589:55 - they should be
589:57 - let's say search
590:01 - users double dots and this will be here
590:05 - fine now we will also need to add a
590:08 - placeholder here
590:09 - and in this we will make the font size
590:12 - same as the input so make section at
590:14 - both places
590:16 - so here and here as well
590:19 - now we will see this but 16 is too much
590:22 - or maybe we need to do font family
590:26 - let's say enter
590:29 - okay so I think this should be 15 or
590:32 - even 14.
590:35 - so here also
590:38 - yes I guess that's fine
590:40 - let me add this here also
590:43 - yes we are having this
590:45 - okay one more thing we should have a
590:48 - margin left on the search user so margin
590:51 - left uh 20 Pips
590:54 - yes it's now it it's now perfect
590:57 - or maybe 15 will be more perfect yes
591:02 - okay now we have the search users we
591:04 - also need an icon here so we can place
591:07 - the icon in this div
591:08 - so that we can set this to pause to see
591:11 - the uh to see the top bar so let me go
591:14 - to react icons
591:17 - and here let me add our tools close icon
591:21 - some close I can from here
591:24 - so we can choose this icon called AI
591:27 - outline closed Circle
591:29 - so let me import this
591:32 - from react icons
591:35 - slash AI
591:37 - now this should be on this x button I
591:40 - mean let me just first create it
591:42 - okay let me check here
591:44 - so we have a icon here let's make size
591:46 - to be
591:49 - 20.
591:51 - yes now on the click of the icon they
591:55 - should be false so take on click
592:00 - this should be
592:02 - pulse now if you click okay
592:05 - also I have to
592:06 - close this yes
592:10 - now click this you will see the top bar
592:13 - icons and then if you click it again
592:15 - I mean search you will sits
592:18 - now we have to arrange this icon so add
592:21 - your div around it
592:23 - or maybe not this just add a class name
592:25 - here
592:27 - and they should be
592:29 - close icon
592:31 - now let me copy close icon
592:34 - and come over here to
592:37 - search user damn it search users here
592:41 - so say close icon
592:44 - say but first we also need to do display
592:47 - Flex here
592:49 - to make them in a single row like this
592:51 - now in the closer icon we can say margin
592:53 - left minus 20px
592:56 - yes or maybe 25
592:59 - or what if we add 30.
593:02 - it's 30 is fine
593:03 - okay now we have to make a learn items
593:06 - Center
593:07 - to make them in a single I mean win a
593:09 - single row like this perfect
593:12 - we can close it also
593:14 - okay if we close this we will say this
593:16 - then fine now also we have to change the
593:19 - color so just copy the color
593:23 - and add it here
593:24 - and then make the color as BBB
593:28 - save this and it's too light so I guess
593:31 - we have to use this color
593:36 - now we have to use this and I guess
593:38 - that's fine
593:39 - yes
593:41 - so it works perfectly
593:43 - now we need a state to handle the search
593:45 - input
593:46 - so let me create it here
593:48 - let's say const
593:50 - uh search input
593:54 - comma
593:55 - set search
593:59 - input equals to use state
594:02 - they are a string now let me pass this
594:06 - set search input in this search users
594:10 - then we can simply get it from props
594:14 - and on this input we will do on change
594:18 - like this
594:20 - and then we can set search input to the
594:23 - event dot target.value so the event here
594:26 - and in here we can do the event
594:29 - dot Target dot value
594:32 - now save this now what we can do is we
594:36 - will have
594:37 - this search input as the value of the
594:39 - input
594:40 - now we'll create one more div here
594:43 - to handle the search options that we
594:45 - will have so
594:47 - let me make a div
594:49 - and this table only visible when we have
594:51 - search input
594:52 - so first let me create the contents so
594:55 - make this as
594:56 - search
594:58 - results first
595:01 - save this now let me come over here I
595:04 - think we don't need this okay let's
595:06 - leave it come over here
595:08 - okay not here in the top bar class
595:11 - here and in here we can just add this
595:15 - called search input this class
595:18 - and it's a bit
595:19 - 400 pixels
595:21 - hide the same
595:23 - background color
595:25 - as white
595:27 - and save so it will be here
595:30 - so let me close this for now
595:33 - so
595:34 - one more thing is to do here is make the
595:37 - position as absolute
595:39 - now it's on the very left
595:41 - then we can say left as 100 pixels
595:45 - and yes and top is also let's say 100
595:52 - .
595:53 - okay 100 is too much try 70.
595:57 - yes I guess 70 is fine then this should
595:59 - be also not 100 I'm in the width or not
596:01 - 400 so 350.
596:03 - or 300
596:05 - yes I gets that's fine we also make to
596:08 - 70 or 20. or 290
596:12 - I guess that's fine
596:13 - also height should be
596:15 - let's say 300 for now yes now we have
596:20 - this search option here
596:22 - so we can just make border radius 10
596:26 - pixels to make them rounded and let's
596:29 - add a small border to one piece solid
596:33 - say BBB
596:37 - if and we will have border around this
596:40 - we can move them to the top a little bit
596:42 - more so say for T fixed will be top or
596:46 - 50
596:47 - or 60
596:48 - is fine I guess
596:51 - now we have to only show this when we
596:53 - have the data in the search user's input
596:55 - so we can just hide this
596:58 - when it's empty so just copy search
597:01 - input
597:02 - and say if it is I'm this if the length
597:06 - of search input
597:09 - wait if the length of this
597:13 - is equals to 0 then show nothing
597:18 - if it is not 0 I mean if the actual
597:21 - input is there so this so let me search
597:23 - for something called Nishan and then it
597:26 - will be here
597:27 - if I close this I mean remove this this
597:29 - will disappear
597:31 - okay
597:32 - one more thing I want to do say if I
597:34 - search nishanth here
597:36 - then I closed this input
597:39 - so it will be here also
597:41 - so we have to make sure that this tip
597:43 - disappears
597:44 - so what we have to do is we have to just
597:47 - set the search input here so we are
597:49 - getting it
597:50 - so whenever we close the search input
597:53 - using this close icon we have to close I
597:56 - mean we have to make this as empty
597:59 - now let me try let me search for Nissan
598:03 - then X
598:05 - and this will disappear
598:07 - okay that's done
598:09 - in here in the let me search for Nishant
598:12 - and let me just make this as permanent
598:15 - for now so revert the state I mean add a
598:19 - exclamation mark before such input dot
598:22 - length check
598:23 - now this will be permanent
598:25 - and in here we will map through all the
598:27 - users for now
598:29 - so let me get the users I mean all users
598:32 - API calls so say import
598:35 - get all users from this route
598:38 - let me create a user Factor
598:40 - here
598:41 - it's the use effect
598:44 - in here they will simply
598:46 - return this function which is called get
598:49 - all users
598:51 - okay now we need a state to store the
598:54 - data when we are calling this functions
598:56 - as response users
598:59 - and set users
599:02 - equals to use state
599:04 - the empty array now simply pass this
599:07 - here
599:08 - and then we can map to the users here
599:11 - so let me come over here and say users
599:14 - dot map
599:16 - single user that we will need and then
599:19 - we will return
599:20 - a dip one more div
599:24 - and in the div we will have one image
599:26 - stack first for the icon of the user
599:30 - the image source this will be
599:33 - user dot image link
599:39 - and then save this and you will have the
599:42 - big image for now now second thing we
599:45 - need here is the name of the user so say
599:48 - user dot name
599:51 - now let me give this P tag a class name
599:53 - of name
599:55 - let me go more Let me give this Diva
599:57 - class name of
599:59 - search
600:00 - inner
600:03 - now save this let me copy this search in
600:07 - a class come to top bar class and let me
600:10 - just do this first we will have the
600:12 - image so save it
600:14 - so it should be for TPX
600:16 - height for TPX
600:19 - save and they will be smaller
600:21 - okay we have this image then
600:25 - I think 40 is too small make it 50.
600:31 - and what when it is border
600:34 - radius 50 percent
600:37 - object fit
600:40 - object fit as cover
600:43 - yes now they will be rounded
600:45 - so meanwhile also we can do to make this
600:48 - as Auto so that it figures I mean it
600:50 - contains the data perfectly and it
600:53 - changes when the user list changes
600:55 - dynamically
600:57 - now
600:58 - in this certain
600:59 - displays Flex
601:02 - and flex Direction on Direction let's
601:05 - say the semi content
601:06 - paste evenly
601:09 - yes but I think we don't need this to
601:11 - remove it we can just say gap between
601:14 - them
601:16 - Gap
601:18 - 20 pixels
601:20 - so we will have a gap between them let
601:22 - me add padding as
601:24 - 10 pixels
601:26 - yes I guess that's fine
601:27 - okay
601:29 - so I think Gap is so much to make it 10.
601:34 - okay then make align items enter as well
601:38 - okay I think we can remove Gap and see
601:40 - what happens
601:41 - okay
601:43 - fine okay I think we can make this as
601:47 - let's say 40 and 40. because 50 is much
601:51 - bigger I guess that's fine
601:54 - then comes the P tag which is dot name
601:57 - so here we will have Point family as
602:00 - let's say enter again
602:03 - I think internet is default so make
602:04 - system UI
602:09 - okay
602:10 - okay one thing I can do is make the Gap
602:14 - is 10 only
602:16 - and make justify content Center
602:20 - okay this is not looks good I think
602:23 - that's fine so I think we can decrease
602:25 - the height here I mean width here
602:27 - so make case 250
602:29 - or 240 okay I guess that's better
602:34 - then
602:35 - if I remove padding anything what
602:37 - happens okay but it doesn't work
602:40 - okay now
602:42 - we have the names so make font size as
602:46 - 16px
602:48 - or maybe 18
602:50 - yes they are now much better looking
602:52 - now when we hover this search in Earth
602:55 - we have to change the background color
602:57 - of it's a little bit darker let's say
603:02 - search Inner
603:04 - over
603:05 - then say background color
603:07 - as
603:09 - say this baby baby
603:12 - now hover them the color will change
603:14 - Also let's add cursor as pointer
603:20 - like this now it's better okay
603:24 - and one more thing
603:26 - we will have
603:28 - here it is border radius
603:30 - 10 pixels
603:36 - yes it's now look it now looks fine
603:39 - you can write same here and see what
603:40 - happens in the hover class
603:43 - I think that's fine okay
603:47 - wait a sec no I don't think
603:50 - okay I think that's fine
603:53 - maybe it's not
603:58 - I think we can remove it from here and
604:00 - then see what happens
604:02 - okay this is the problem here
604:07 - border ideas should be
604:10 - 10 pixels should be here
604:13 - okay let me leave it here this radius 10
604:16 - pixels
604:18 - okay
604:20 - now what we have to do is okay if we
604:24 - okay
604:26 - so this is done
604:27 - we have search items here
604:30 - okay what is the next step that I wanted
604:33 - to do is if we click close
604:37 - it will not open up because it's
604:39 - reverted the state is reverted here
604:42 - so let me now
604:44 - create a function here
604:46 - so set const and this will be handle
604:52 - search
604:53 - so this function will be the bounds
604:55 - function that will run after one second
604:59 - after one second of typing yes
605:02 - but wait second yes this will run after
605:04 - one second of typing
605:07 - so
605:08 - in this function we have to filter
605:10 - through this users
605:12 - so we'll see user dot filter
605:15 - and then this will take a param called
605:17 - user a single user
605:19 - then we have to return this thing so
605:23 - basically whenever we search we will
605:26 - filter and each user we have to go
605:29 - through some checks checks the first
605:33 - we will convert the user value I mean
605:37 - all the users to a value and an array so
605:40 - make objective values and pass users
605:42 - here
605:44 - then we will join I mean we will just
605:47 - convert the data in a string
605:51 - array
605:54 - and then we'll convert it to lowercase
605:58 - yes
605:59 - so that when we type anything and the
606:02 - data will inside the array we have to
606:05 - match them together
606:06 - so basically we will convert the name
606:08 - like Nishant command to Nishant Kumar
606:10 - two small case
606:13 - and then the search input as well to
606:15 - small case so that it matches perfectly
606:18 - and then we will have includes and this
606:21 - will contain our search input
606:23 - and this I just I that said that we have
606:26 - to convert this into lowercase as well
606:28 - so make it to lower case
606:30 - and simply
606:33 - it will be returned now let me sort the
606:36 - data in a state called response or maybe
606:41 - third
606:43 - here
606:44 - let me create a date here called
606:47 - const
606:49 - or maybe fill just researched
606:53 - but this will call I mean this will
606:55 - cause
606:56 - name clashes so make
606:59 - this let's say
607:01 - filtered users
607:06 - that
607:07 - filtered users you can make this a
607:11 - search results as well
607:12 - so it's used it also an array
607:16 - so we will just have to set this search
607:19 - in here
607:21 - but we will only store this search in
607:26 - here when this filter I mean search
607:28 - input is not empty
607:31 - so I'll make a check so if the search
607:34 - users is not empty
607:37 - wait only then we will run all of the
607:40 - stuff
607:41 - else we will run I will we will set
607:44 - this set filtered to the real array
607:48 - which is called users
607:51 - this here
607:52 - we have done this
607:55 - okay now all of this is happening in
607:57 - handle search and this function will go
608:00 - inside a device function that I will
608:02 - create now
608:03 - so now let me just map through this and
608:05 - we will see nothing because we have new
608:08 - users
608:10 - okay okay so what we can do is create
608:13 - one more use effect book here
608:18 - to handle our demand function
608:20 - so
608:21 - this will run I mean the similar Factor
608:24 - will run whenever our field I mean our
608:28 - search input changes the state changes
608:31 - like this now what we have to do is just
608:34 - call this function so let me create one
608:37 - thing called let the bounced
608:40 - equals to set timeout
608:44 - so whenever
608:46 - we are searching the set timeout will
608:48 - run
608:49 - and
608:51 - it will run every one thousand second I
608:53 - mean on 1000 seconds
608:55 - sorry one thousand second no one
608:57 - thousand not one thousand second one
609:00 - second
609:01 - this is millisecond
609:03 - okay so when we run this we should have
609:06 - this handle search inside
609:09 - like this
609:10 - and then we have to clear the timeout so
609:14 - when we unmount the component or when
609:17 - the component gets unmounted we have to
609:19 - return
609:21 - this so let me I mean we have to clear
609:24 - the timeout so clear timeout
609:26 - and then pass the bounce here
609:29 - and this will run our search
609:32 - now you can try this we have tried
609:34 - refresh
609:36 - so we see this uh we see this here
609:40 - so how to remove it is just make the
609:42 - height
609:43 - wait a sec
609:45 - what is it let me come to the bottom and
609:47 - see the problem here
609:49 - third inner
609:51 - search result
609:54 - so search okay make this as
609:56 - remove this now it will disappear
609:59 - now let's search for Nishan
610:02 - so all of these users will come up here
610:04 - like this if we search for Nishant
610:08 - Kumar to
610:11 - only this user will come up here here
610:15 - if you remove this
610:16 - and close it we will see nothing
610:20 - now let me search for some random thing
610:22 - and we will see nothing
610:24 - so we can make sure I mean we can add a
610:27 - div here
610:28 - or maybe a free tag and say what we can
610:31 - say let me just copy search results
610:33 - again and add it here
610:36 - and then here we can say
610:40 - no result bound
610:45 - I think we should get it here
610:48 - okay I think they should not be here
610:51 - because this is on the uh they should
610:54 - this is only on when the length is zero
610:56 - I mean when the search input is empty
610:58 - so let me invert this back and think
611:01 - what can we do to avoid this
611:03 - so we are filtered users
611:06 - okay
611:08 - so
611:10 - um
611:11 - let's add this so if the length of the
611:14 - filtered users
611:16 - is zero
611:18 - then it will show that the result is
611:21 - empty I mean the array is empty or else
611:24 - we'll map through it so if we type
611:26 - something like
611:27 - no data
611:30 - or let me make this third day first
611:34 - and here we can say
611:36 - no data
611:38 - so we will say this
611:40 - so make sure to add
611:42 - that make sure to add this class name
611:45 - here
611:47 - so that it comes like this so maybe we
611:50 - can change this to
611:52 - no results
611:57 - found
612:00 - and we will get it here
612:02 - so now let me search for Nishant
612:05 - and we will get the data here
612:07 - like this after one second basically
612:11 - yes I guess we are doing it one more
612:13 - thing so if we click a user from here we
612:16 - should be on this user's profile page so
612:20 - we can do that by passing
612:22 - a state so on this let me create a
612:25 - function here
612:26 - so they should be called as const
612:31 - open user
612:36 - and when we click I mean when the
612:38 - function runs we will navigate to the
612:40 - profile page with the user's ID and
612:43 - email
612:44 - so
612:45 - let me come over here and on this div
612:48 - search units say on click
612:52 - okay open user and in here
612:56 - we can simply pass this user the current
612:59 - user that we have
613:02 - okay so now come over here and have user
613:06 - then we can say navigate
613:10 - so profile page
613:15 - and then
613:16 - we can have a state
613:18 - and in the state we will have ID
613:21 - which will be user dot ID
613:25 - then we will have a state I am another
613:27 - called email
613:28 - which will be user Dot
613:31 - I think it's email or user email let me
613:33 - check
613:34 - come to this component called
613:36 - profile card okay not profile card
613:38 - postcard
613:40 - here we will have a state so it's user
613:43 - ID and user email
613:46 - so let me copy
613:48 - okay it's from Posts not from this so I
613:51 - guess
613:52 - we can close this this and make this as
613:56 - simply ID and
613:57 - let's say user
614:00 - email but let me check if it is correct
614:02 - component or not
614:04 - I think it is or maybe it's just user ID
614:07 - and user email
614:10 - to make the ID here it has user ID
614:13 - and we already have username
614:15 - now we can try this so click let's say
614:17 - Nishant Kumar and the last one
614:20 - okay let me give it a refresh
614:24 - let me search for
614:26 - Nishant
614:28 - now let me click the last one
614:30 - okay so we are having on our own page so
614:33 - I guess this is ID not user ID
614:35 - now let me check again
614:37 - click I mean search for user
614:41 - let me click Nishant Kumar in the middle
614:45 - okay we already we are having on this
614:47 - page only
614:48 - so
614:50 - why it is happening
614:52 - we are passing the
614:54 - user
614:55 - okay
614:59 - let me check this
615:01 - array called users
615:05 - say the correct state that we need to
615:07 - pass I mean correct values
615:11 - so we have an array here
615:14 - with three elements inside
615:16 - so we have ID
615:18 - okay we have also have okay I think we
615:21 - were passing the IDS
615:23 - 1 6. iD is this email is this
615:28 - okay name is navigating to that page
615:32 - it's working here but not here
615:36 - to ID is this okay and I think the email
615:40 - is okay we have email not user email yes
615:43 - now let's see if it works or not
615:46 - so search for Nishant
615:49 - sir I mean click the last one
615:51 - yes now it's working we're on this
615:53 - user's page
615:54 - then let me click Nishan remain search
615:58 - and click Nishant Kumar in the middle
616:01 - and we will be on that users page
616:04 - so we'll see nothing because we have no
616:06 - posts here
616:07 - so that was how we added such
616:09 - functionality in our application
616:14 - now let's work on the image uploading in
616:18 - posts
616:19 - in our LinkedIn clone app
616:21 - so what we will do is first we will need
616:24 - an icon in this
616:26 - starter post
616:27 - here so we can check
616:30 - this posts card no we don't need this
616:32 - and neither this come over to this
616:35 - component called post update here so
616:39 - that I mean here we have
616:41 - uh this currently okay not here I mean
616:44 - button
616:45 - so let me open model component here
616:50 - here is this modal component CSS model
616:55 - so in here we can simply do this after
616:58 - the input
617:00 - I'm in this input and one more thing I
617:02 - want to do is change this input to input
617:04 - I'm in text area not input
617:07 - so make this as I mean this
617:10 - and so that we can do this I will expand
617:13 - this
617:14 - okay but one thing is wrong here we need
617:18 - to change the I think width of this
617:21 - so
617:22 - if you remove it what will happen
617:25 - okay not width we have to do this so
617:28 - rows
617:30 - should be let's say three
617:33 - and columns
617:35 - will be three as well so initially let's
617:38 - try this
617:39 - okay let me close the model and try
617:41 - again
617:42 - okay this does not change
617:44 - if we remove this
617:46 - okay I think we can do this as well so
617:49 - if I replace the page
617:52 - I think then we click okay do I have to
617:56 - bring it back and now it's fine
617:59 - so we can drag this and this
618:02 - but the problem is I want to stop
618:05 - dragging or hide the button
618:07 - so let me search on Google how
618:11 - to hide
618:12 - uh I have to hide the text area
618:18 - resizer let's remove this disable this
618:23 - so we can check this so we have a class
618:26 - called resize I mean we have a property
618:28 - called
618:29 - it is size none so let's try this
618:32 - and yes it has been disappeared okay so
618:36 - we cannot resize it
618:38 - here
618:39 - so we only have this where we can type
618:42 - our stuff and fine
618:44 - so now just I said that I wanted one
618:47 - icon here so let me go over to react
618:49 - icons again
618:51 - react icons
618:53 - here
618:54 - we will just search for Icon called
618:56 - let's say picture
618:59 - and
619:00 - let me try which icon should we use
619:04 - so let's try this outline picture
619:07 - let me import it here
619:10 - so we can just say
619:12 - AI or plant picture from react icons
619:16 - slash okay
619:19 - now just let me
619:21 - add this icon here
619:26 - and let me check that if you have icono
619:29 - here or not yes we have
619:30 - so mix size let's say 30
619:34 - yes it's now a little bit big
619:37 - also we need to change the color of this
619:39 - so make the color
619:41 - to be
619:43 - wait or better to I mean one thing we
619:47 - can do is just to give it a class name
619:49 - so this should be
619:53 - picture icon
619:55 - now let me copy this class name and come
619:58 - over here and we can do it inside or
620:01 - outside let's do it outside because I
620:03 - think
620:04 - modal input is this so it will not work
620:07 - if we added it inside
620:09 - so we need the color blue so let me come
620:12 - over here and
620:13 - choose this color I think
620:15 - yes
620:16 - add it here like color will be this
620:20 - now color has been changed let me also
620:23 - add cursor as pointer
620:26 - pointer where is it here
620:29 - like this now we have this icon
620:31 - and we can upload our image from here
620:35 - okay
620:36 - so
620:37 - I think we can do this so we can make it
620:40 - at the bottom
620:43 - so I mean in alignment to this post
620:45 - button so just make position as absolute
620:49 - bottom
620:52 - uh 20 pixels
620:54 - it's now it looks better I guess
620:58 - we can also make it bigger so just make
621:00 - it 35
621:02 - and it's here okay
621:04 - we can change the icon so I think I
621:07 - think it's perfect or maybe you can use
621:09 - any other icons from here
621:11 - okay let's see where that
621:14 - okay
621:15 - now what will happen is when we click
621:17 - this icon I mean picture icon we should
621:20 - be able to select a file
621:22 - so let me make a input here
621:26 - input and maybe give this ID as let's
621:29 - say
621:30 - pick upload
621:33 - like this
621:34 - okay
621:35 - we will have input and also the type
621:38 - will be of file
621:41 - now we'll have this okay now let me add
621:44 - a label here
621:48 - and we will use the for
621:51 - CE and this will be called as pickup
621:53 - load
621:55 - yes
621:56 - so let me add it here
621:58 - so
622:00 - we don't see a label yet so if I just
622:04 - close the model
622:05 - Okay add the text also so it should say
622:10 - upload image
622:12 - now it's it so now if you click this
622:15 - upload image text
622:16 - this
622:17 - file selector will open in Windows
622:21 - so we have to make this as hidden
622:23 - so that we don't see this other
622:26 - input we only have this
622:29 - so we can try we can move this inside
622:31 - this label and
622:33 - we will have the icon image uploaded to
622:36 - it
622:37 - but this and replace this
622:40 - now if you click this icon we will open
622:43 - up
622:44 - pilot load window I mean image upload
622:47 - window
622:48 - now what we can do is close this now we
622:52 - need to select a file and store its
622:55 - contents in a state or a variable
622:58 - I mean State yes
623:00 - so we can do it
623:02 - in this so we need to create a state
623:04 - called set cons current image
623:09 - set
623:10 - current
623:12 - image
623:15 - equals to use State say object or an
623:19 - object not an object an object
623:21 - now let me pass set what is it Set
623:24 - current image
623:26 - to home order component
623:29 - let me get it here
623:32 - and when we click this button
623:35 - we should store the contents in that
623:38 - stage so say on change
623:43 - so Set current image so this will take
623:46 - an event param
623:48 - and then we can store
623:51 - event dot Target
623:55 - Dot
623:56 - files zeroth index and
624:00 - that's all I guess now let's try to
624:03 - console
624:04 - this current image to see what we get
624:07 - here
624:10 - so let me open the console bring it down
624:15 - here
624:16 - then let me open the poster status then
624:20 - let me select image here
624:22 - let's say an image for example this and
624:26 - you will get the data here
624:28 - in this
624:30 - console
624:31 - now we have to pass this correct image
624:34 - to a function
624:37 - and that will return us the link of the
624:39 - image back to us so let me create that
624:42 - function in API image upload API
624:45 - so we have this upload image const
624:48 - so make and replicate this and I mean
624:53 - say post image upload
624:55 - or upload post image
624:58 - yes so it will take the file and I don't
625:01 - think we need the rest so this should be
625:04 - post images not profile images so make
625:06 - it like this
625:08 - so file it will take it will create the
625:10 - reference so let me create the reference
625:12 - for this as well
625:13 - so this should be
625:16 - post fixed ref
625:19 - and this reference will go up here
625:22 - and okay I think that's fine if it
625:25 - provided we'll see an error let me
625:29 - remove all this stuff
625:31 - and just create a state here
625:35 - so we can close the model for now and
625:37 - read one state here for the image ending
625:40 - so say const
625:41 - image or
625:43 - post image
625:46 - that post
625:48 - image it was to use it
625:52 - they are strength because it will be
625:54 - linked in a spring value
625:56 - now let me pass
625:58 - okay we need to call the function as
626:00 - well upload post image
626:02 - so let's do that
626:05 - import
626:07 - upload post
626:10 - image and
626:13 - let me
626:15 - add this here when we're selecting the
626:17 - image so I guess that should be
626:22 - here or we can just pass it directly but
626:25 - wait a second
626:28 - okay what did we pass it directly
626:33 - and come over here in the model.jsx file
626:37 - index file
626:38 - let me get it here as frogs
626:43 - upload post image so
626:46 - this file will take a I mean this
626:49 - function will take a file directly
626:52 - so we can assign it directly like this
626:55 - we don't have to add this in a state and
626:57 - then pass the state
626:58 - so
626:59 - save this
627:01 - when we're select whenever we select a
627:03 - file
627:03 - this should be uploaded
627:06 - yes
627:07 - and I mean when we select a file this
627:10 - function will run and the image will be
627:12 - uploaded okay so close the model and let
627:16 - me come over here
627:17 - and
627:19 - Set current image we don't need it here
627:22 - let me remove that from there as well
627:25 - I mean Set current image
627:28 - we are not using this
627:30 - okay now close this and
627:34 - okay we had a state for the image link
627:36 - so also let me pass it here
627:41 - so pass it here
627:44 - let me get it here
627:46 - why am I closing this
627:48 - again and again and again again
627:51 - set post image
627:53 - so whenever this function gets called
627:55 - where you have to pass the target I mean
627:59 - image and the set post image function to
628:02 - set it the link
628:04 - so we can get it here
628:07 - and here we can simply
628:09 - set the response
628:12 - now let me close modal component and
628:15 - come over to index
628:17 - so let me just console.log this post
628:20 - image
628:21 - and I don't think we need this so remove
628:23 - the state from here
628:25 - okay now let's try this
628:29 - open the console
628:33 - and select up start the post
628:35 - then
628:38 - 17 okay let me now select the file here
628:42 - so let's say this file
628:46 - set progress will not be fine okay some
628:49 - problem we have here okay we don't have
628:52 - set progress so yes
628:55 - we can simply console.log this progress
629:00 - and try again
629:03 - so
629:04 - let me select a post I mean select image
629:07 - again different image let's say
629:11 - this image
629:13 - this image we can select
629:16 - so we are having the percentage and
629:19 - after that we will have this link so
629:21 - click this link
629:22 - and the image will open up in a new
629:24 - window and a new tab now we can use the
629:28 - post image as the preview of the image
629:31 - so let me pass this as well in the model
629:35 - component and come over here
629:38 - so I don't think we need that for now
629:41 - open the model component file
629:45 - get it here
629:46 - now add an image tag here so let's do it
629:49 - after the
629:51 - text area and before the labels I mean
629:55 - image upload file level
629:57 - so say IMG SRC
630:00 - post image
630:02 - fine quality will be
630:05 - post
630:07 - image and we will see the image tag only
630:10 - when the length of this is more than
630:13 - zero
630:15 - it says that
630:18 - if it is false I mean if it is 0 less
630:21 - than 0
630:22 - then we will not see that image
630:24 - so also we can style this so say class
630:27 - name
630:28 - post image
630:31 - I'm saying no post image preview
630:35 - preview image yes copy the class
630:39 - now let me come over to this index and
630:41 - say preview image then save width should
630:45 - be 100 percent
630:47 - yes so we are saying this
630:49 - and if it is here
630:52 - the entire other probe I mean other
630:56 - things break as well
630:58 - so we have to make
631:01 - this in a div I mean these two maybe
631:06 - let's say this
631:09 - it's not works perfect
631:11 - okay now we can type anything
631:15 - it will be like this okay
631:17 - fine
631:19 - so when we close this they should be
631:22 - empty so we can set that
631:24 - so I made this set post image should be
631:27 - empty
631:29 - so where's the x button that we used to
631:31 - close the model
631:32 - on cancel and
631:35 - on
631:37 - OK yes so do this
631:40 - now if we close this the image will be
631:43 - not here anymore we will only see
631:47 - these things now let me upload one more
631:50 - image here
631:52 - so basically where does it let me find
631:54 - the image like this
631:57 - so if it is uploaded
631:59 - we should see the image here
632:01 - yes
632:03 - so we can also add a loader here or the
632:05 - same thing that we had
632:07 - and this is a I mean the spinner or
632:09 - flowers bar
632:11 - so let me go over
632:12 - to file upload model
632:16 - yes and get the circle
632:19 - I mean the progress from here
632:21 - and I think we need let me keep this
632:25 - so we'll have the progress
632:28 - at the place of image so if the post
632:30 - length Okay we cannot do that let's add
632:33 - it here
632:37 - so
632:39 - let me get it
632:42 - yeah let me just create it here
632:46 - the second const
632:48 - progress
632:49 - and
632:51 - that
632:52 - progress equals to use state
632:55 - say zero
633:00 - zero because fluoride should be zero
633:02 - initially
633:04 - so now we can set it
633:07 - after passing or not I mean passing this
633:10 - yes let's pass
633:11 - in here
633:12 - coming up to file upload model and get
633:15 - it here
633:16 - set progress
633:18 - wait not here sorry come to the
633:23 - where is it
633:25 - where is it file upload I think here yes
633:28 - so we already have
633:30 - okay this function is different so we
633:32 - have the set orders
633:34 - so let me set the progress here
633:37 - okay toilet is not defined here but we
633:41 - do have progress state
633:43 - I mean in this state
633:45 - so let's check for this
633:47 - okay this progress is not defined
633:50 - so let me get the progress from
633:53 - this component called Phi laptop model
633:56 - I mean all these items but we don't need
633:58 - space so we can remove this
634:01 - to copy this
634:02 - come over here
634:05 - just replace this
634:07 - and we will see this so the progress is
634:10 - like this initially so we can hide it
634:13 - when it's not I mean when it's zero so
634:16 - to hide that
634:17 - I can simply make this as a conditional
634:21 - so
634:22 - if the progress is zero then don't show
634:25 - it
634:26 - so it is 0 then don't show it
634:31 - else
634:33 - I manipulate 0 yes then don't show it
634:36 - okay wait
634:38 - so
634:39 - make a empty fragment here
634:42 - then if it is not zero then only show it
634:44 - I mean show the problem is increasing
634:47 - so we can try let me upload a file here
634:51 - called this
634:52 - and we will save longness
634:55 - we can make this in the center so let me
634:57 - search for
634:58 - okay also we need to hide this when it
635:01 - reaches zero I mean not 0 hundred so or
635:04 - progress
635:06 - equals 200
635:09 - okay
635:10 - so now
635:12 - we have to make this in the center
635:15 - so let me copy product by class
635:19 - and search for it
635:21 - here it is
635:22 - so we can move this thing okay it's not
635:26 - in the center
635:27 - so I guess what we can do is
635:30 - open this file called modal and this is
635:35 - a progress
635:36 - and it's interesting so make this div
635:40 - a class name of let's say
635:43 - post
635:45 - area or maybe posts body I guess
635:50 - yes
635:52 - now let me copy this post's body
635:56 - come to this index.js and say display of
636:01 - flex
636:02 - justify content Center
636:05 - in Flash Direction then column
636:08 - now it's fine
636:10 - now let's see to upload and try to
636:12 - upload an image
636:14 - this image we can try okay
636:18 - so let me start from the beginning let
636:21 - me select the image here
636:23 - doesn't go away
636:28 - okay let me put image
636:31 - this image is
636:34 - so we will see the progress bar
636:38 - and now the image we see here
636:40 - so
636:42 - a line item should be centered
636:45 - a line items how to type this enter
636:49 - now if we close this and try again
636:53 - let's upload the image here
636:55 - let's say this and the
636:59 - progress will be in the center
637:01 - and after that we will see the image
637:03 - here
637:04 - okay
637:06 - now we can type
637:07 - log in and
637:10 - sign up function
637:12 - and by the way we also need to send the
637:15 - image link
637:17 - to firestore when we are replicating
637:20 - post here
637:21 - so this is the function and if you
637:25 - remove this console log and simply add
637:27 - post image as post image it will go
637:31 - there
637:31 - so now click post
637:34 - and it will be updated and you will see
637:37 - the post here
637:38 - but I guess the thing is we have to add
637:40 - this
637:41 - user
637:42 - okay we don't see it here
637:44 - okay the problem is
637:46 - we have to make one check here that I
637:49 - forgot to add previously
637:50 - so
637:52 - this page only shows those posts that
637:55 - are connected to the user I mean the if
637:58 - the user is connected then only we will
638:00 - show these posts
638:01 - but if the user is same like Nishan
638:05 - comma 2 then we don't have anything to
638:07 - show here so we have to also make the RX
638:09 - statement here and then say current ID
638:13 - I mean the current user ID if it is
638:16 - equal to
638:17 - the posts user ID
638:19 - then I will show it here and now we can
638:21 - say this okay
638:23 - fine and also in the profile page we can
638:26 - see if you open this now it's working
638:29 - so I forgot to add that previously now
638:32 - what we can do is we have to show the
638:34 - image here
638:35 - so let me add this in the card so
638:39 - it's the profile image here okay let me
638:42 - add
638:43 - before this name I mean not the name it
638:47 - where is the status let me add it here
638:50 - yes IMG SRC
638:53 - say
638:55 - alt tag
639:00 - post
639:02 - I mean post image
639:05 - and the third will be post slot I think
639:10 - the key name is
639:11 - uh post image let's see
639:15 - post image save
639:17 - and we will have a big image here like
639:19 - this and it looks much like LinkedIn
639:22 - okay
639:24 - so we will only show this image when we
639:27 - have this exactly in the I mean if we
639:29 - have this else we will not show it
639:33 - so we can make an empty flag material
639:35 - because if you see in the other posts we
639:38 - had a empty image icon
639:40 - wait so I guess this looks like legged
639:44 - in here
639:45 - so we can edit this
639:49 - and if you upload another another
639:54 - image so let's see what happens
639:58 - let's try
640:01 - this image
640:05 - click update
640:07 - and update it but we also have to pass
640:09 - the image link to update function
640:14 - so let me come over to the update page
640:16 - where we are updating the data so I
640:19 - think it's it's startup host we have get
640:23 - in data okay
640:25 - let me check here I guess I think it's
640:27 - here only
640:29 - update status
640:31 - update post function which sends us the
640:34 - current ID and the status we also have
640:37 - to pass the post image press post image
640:41 - so let me pass that
640:44 - like this let me go over to the paid
640:47 - post function
640:48 - in the firestore API
640:51 - so update post where are you
640:55 - I think this is post user data known
640:57 - this update post
641:02 - yes here let me get
641:05 - this post image and add it here and this
641:10 - will be our new post image so here it's
641:12 - done
641:14 - now we can try this
641:16 - and now let me read this first one
641:19 - and
641:21 - if you will see this image so what we
641:23 - have to do is
641:24 - we need to show the post image when it
641:27 - is available
641:28 - so where is it in the posts card
641:32 - here
641:34 - okay if I click x button this will close
641:37 - the image so if I select another image
641:39 - let's say this image okay this is for
641:43 - this is for creation let's say for edit
641:48 - so if you wait
641:50 - okay nothing is coming
641:52 - so I guess
641:54 - we can select an image here or maybe we
641:58 - can show this image
642:00 - so if post dot post image
642:04 - okay not here in the post update
642:05 - function
642:07 - better post okay not here as well in the
642:10 - model
642:12 - this model
642:15 - so here
642:17 - we will have the post image so if the
642:20 - length is more than zero then I will
642:22 - show the image
642:23 - okay
642:25 - post image
642:28 - okay let me
642:29 - do one more thing yes one more thing we
642:31 - have to do is this so
642:34 - if the
642:37 - let's say the image link we need for
642:39 - this
642:41 - so
642:42 - let me come over to okay we are getting
642:44 - this text here
642:47 - so
642:48 - current name again where is it
642:51 - postcard model
642:55 - this model
642:57 - we are having this
642:59 - is edit let me come over here is it here
643:03 - we have
643:04 - so update status okay update then post
643:06 - but what about the value which is status
643:10 - so status is coming from here
643:13 - and now let me check
643:15 - whereas what let us is this
643:19 - let me check this function
643:22 - okay not this okay get a data so we also
643:25 - need one more state or
643:28 - we can just say Set current post we can
643:30 - use this now we have to pass
643:33 - this state in the model
643:36 - here
643:37 - so let me pass the current post
643:41 - now come over here
643:43 - let me structure this
643:45 - and okay what is the problem okay this
643:48 - is the problem that okay we have to
643:50 - remove this for now
643:51 - let me console this current post here
643:57 - if you open the console
643:59 - you will get the current post details in
644:02 - an object
644:03 - and we can get the post image from here
644:07 - like this
644:09 - so save
644:10 - and you will get this image link fine
644:13 - now what we have to do is if the either
644:16 - one of them is here I mean if the post
644:19 - image dot length or the current post dot
644:24 - image
644:25 - if we have here
644:28 - okay not length
644:31 - then we can show
644:34 - the post image
644:35 - or the current post dot post image
644:39 - save and if you now check again like for
644:42 - example if I edit this image the image
644:45 - will be here and if I upload one more
644:48 - image here
644:49 - let's see what happens I mean New Image
644:51 - let's say this image
644:54 - so it's uploading and this doesn't
644:56 - disappears I mean it doesn't disappear
644:59 - now it gets
645:01 - after some time
645:03 - now if you update this the new image
645:05 - will be here
645:06 - and that was what we wanted
645:09 - so we can try it again
645:11 - click upload an image
645:13 - let's choose another image for example
645:16 - let's say which image should we try this
645:19 - image
645:20 - so let's wait for it for some time
645:23 - and this image will be replaced with a
645:26 - new image
645:27 - okay also in the previewer image we have
645:30 - to give some margin top
645:33 - so margin top should be 20ps
645:37 - now let me try again
645:41 - start a post okay
645:43 - okay so if we click this
645:46 - okay I guess we have to just
645:49 - close it only then the image will
645:50 - disappear
645:52 - but in this case it doesn't
645:55 - so what we have to do is we have to set
645:56 - the current post also as empty when we
646:00 - close the model
646:01 - so that current post where are we
646:04 - passing
646:06 - so we have to make it as an empty object
646:10 - so Set current post
646:14 - yes let me get this here
646:20 - okay so when we click X
646:23 - there should be an empty object
646:26 - and same thing should be here
646:29 - now let me try
646:31 - let me click close here
646:33 - okay length will be undefined then so we
646:37 - can add
646:38 - this which is question mark it means
646:43 - only if okay I think here as well
646:47 - now it will find
646:48 - now if I click this
646:51 - you will see no image but if I click
646:54 - here we will see this image and we can
646:56 - replace it if I upload one word image
646:59 - here or a different image
647:01 - like this and it will disappear I mean
647:03 - it will replace the image in some time
647:05 - like this
647:06 - now we can just say
647:08 - date and the image will be updated here
647:11 - and okay that's fine
647:17 - now let's do a few changes in our app I
647:20 - mean final changes so first of all we
647:23 - don't need this profile icon here we
647:25 - will need our
647:27 - user icon here so let me come to
647:29 - collectionslayout.jsx
647:33 - and we have the top bar here okay
647:36 - so we have to pass this current user
647:39 - here maybe we need to check where else
647:42 - do we have the top bar I mean pass this
647:45 - current user from everywhere to top bar
647:47 - like this
647:48 - so that we can use our profile picture
647:51 - so add this here and here and here
647:56 - now we can close all these three
647:59 - and in this top bar let me get current
648:06 - user
648:07 - so this will contain our image
648:10 - in this image
648:13 - so now let me go over here
648:15 - in this image link which is the user and
648:18 - replace the user with current user dot
648:21 - image link
648:22 - now save and the image will be here on
648:24 - the top
648:25 - let's style this so in the user logo
648:28 - class let me search
648:31 - we have to make height 40 that we
648:33 - already have but make it 50
648:37 - okay I think 40 is fine then height 40
648:39 - as well
648:41 - then border radius
648:44 - 50 percent
648:47 - and then we can do
648:50 - what can we do object fit
648:54 - another cover yes now it's rounded and
648:58 - fine
648:59 - okay in the next thing we need is
649:02 - one dominate
649:04 - I think we need to make this start a
649:07 - pause button on the left so where is it
649:10 - open this profile I mean post update.jsx
649:14 - it's index file and here we can do that
649:18 - so where is it where is it this open
649:21 - post model button
649:24 - let me search for it here
649:26 - and simply add
649:28 - margin left
649:30 - minus 30 PX
649:32 - yes that's no fine I guess it's fine one
649:35 - more thing we need to do is go to this
649:38 - page called I mean the index.ss file
649:41 - here
649:42 - and this is the color here so remove the
649:45 - color scheme for now I mean from here
649:47 - this will turn to White
649:49 - now we have to make this as anything
649:52 - like this or maybe a little bit darker
649:55 - so I think this is Will fine this will
649:57 - be fine redeem the opacity from this
650:00 - from here okay
650:01 - so we have done this as well
650:03 - okay
650:05 - so what if we remove all of these
650:09 - okay it does nothing so maybe we don't
650:11 - need and neither is this
650:16 - yes so the scroll bar will be changed to
650:19 - light now next thing we need is so we
650:23 - have the images
650:24 - on this page called
650:27 - where does this post
650:30 - s posts card here we have the image
650:33 - links that we see here so what should
650:35 - happen when we click this should I mean
650:38 - we should see the image opening up in a
650:42 - model so let me come over to art design
650:47 - and create a model here
650:54 - let me make quickly I think we should
650:57 - add a component for this
650:58 - or we can just add it in this component
651:01 - as well
651:03 - first we need to create a state so
651:06 - cons
651:07 - image model
651:10 - that image model
651:12 - equals to you state
651:14 - this will be called as
651:16 - false
651:18 - okay now
651:20 - we will have this model here
651:23 - with
651:25 - this vertical centered model
651:27 - we need JavaScript so we need to add a
651:30 - modal at the bottom
651:33 - far away from here
651:35 - and come to the bottom let's add it here
651:39 - okay not here maybe here
651:44 - make this as or just remove title from
651:47 - here
651:48 - and this should be known as
651:50 - image model I think
651:54 - and to set it we have set image model
651:59 - here
652:01 - we don't need the contents so remove
652:03 - them from here and we need a button I
652:06 - mean not a button we will need a
652:09 - uh what is it a function I mean we need
652:12 - only given to set this to true so that
652:15 - it opens up I'm in the model
652:17 - so this would be okay model is not
652:19 - defined we have to Define this as well
652:22 - so we can get this and let's say
652:26 - okay we don't have anything from our
652:28 - design so let me import
652:31 - it here
652:33 - now
652:34 - this picture
652:36 - will open up this image model when we
652:39 - click it
652:40 - so where it is in the picture
652:42 - the image
652:44 - like button we have okay
652:47 - all user.filter
652:49 - okay note this this is the image yes
652:53 - so we can see on click
652:55 - this set image model to true
652:58 - let me make this as a callback function
653:01 - like this and whenever clicking the
653:03 - image
653:05 - okay this is something else maybe
653:08 - wait
653:09 - all users
653:11 - I think this is not the image
653:14 - okay image is this
653:19 - where is the image
653:21 - this is the name
653:23 - I think the image is here somewhere
653:26 - oh yes this is the image so let me add
653:28 - it here
653:29 - now click this and the model will open
653:33 - so we have to make the model as empty we
653:35 - only need the image there
653:37 - so we also need to remove these buttons
653:40 - which are
653:41 - on okay on cancel
653:44 - maybe we have to set the footer as an
653:46 - empty array using footer prop
653:49 - so where does this photo
653:51 - this
653:53 - so
653:55 - let me just curve a footer
653:57 - array object sorry object settings
654:00 - and make it as empty
654:03 - and then save and we will have no
654:06 - buttons here just in close icon I mean
654:08 - one close icon so I guess we have to
654:10 - bring these back
654:12 - okay okay let me add it again
654:15 - and yes
654:17 - and maybe in this footer we have to add
654:19 - the button
654:21 - okay not the button yes it will be
654:23 - closing okay now on the image we have to
654:27 - set a cursor as pointer
654:29 - so let me come to
654:31 - uh post image okay this is Alt
654:35 - let me check
654:38 - where is the image
654:42 - okay image image image text status
654:45 - this is the image post image yes to say
654:48 - cursor
654:49 - as pointer
654:54 - okay one sec I think this is not it
654:59 - where it is
655:01 - post image
655:04 - post image wrapper posts card
655:07 - okay I guess I guess status we have here
655:10 - before this we have the image
655:13 - let me search for image here okay we
655:15 - don't see anything
655:18 - maybe we have to add up maybe we need to
655:20 - collect a class name we are called
655:22 - post
655:25 - class name
655:28 - equals to
655:30 - post
655:32 - image
655:35 - image yes
655:38 - that's it
655:40 - let me now add this okay
655:43 - okay I think post image is somewhere
655:46 - else this is the post image
655:49 - so maybe we can replace this post image
655:53 - or this should be not post image it
655:56 - should be profile image
655:59 - here so let me copy in this and replace
656:03 - other post image
656:05 - with this
656:07 - here
656:08 - we can replace now save and yes it will
656:12 - be fine
656:13 - now where is
656:15 - okay this is the profile image
656:17 - we need for post image so we can remove
656:20 - the cursor pointer from here and add dot
656:23 - post
656:26 - image
656:28 - and then that cursor to be pointed now
656:31 - this will be pointer cursor and whenever
656:33 - we click this image
656:36 - we will open up a
656:38 - we will open up this model and in this
656:41 - model we have to pass the image so we
656:44 - can just copy this image from here
656:47 - and simply paste it in the model
656:50 - here
656:54 - and okay this is not the thing we want
656:57 - this is profile image we need post image
657:00 - sorry again
657:01 - I am confused so we need
657:04 - this
657:08 - and add it here
657:12 - it will be very big
657:14 - so let me let me make profile image
657:18 - sorry not profile image post image and
657:21 - width should be hundred percent only
657:25 - now I guess this will be small maybe not
657:28 - let's see 50 percent
657:31 - okay what is happening
657:34 - what is happening
657:35 - let me cut this post image and paste it
657:39 - outside so that we can all access it
657:42 - okay we can access it
657:44 - yes we can let me also make margin top
657:49 - let's say 30 bits so that we have the x
657:51 - button here
657:53 - so that we can close it and we can give
657:56 - title here or remove the script item
657:59 - okay
658:00 - if you click this image this will be
658:02 - open up open up it will open up and yes
658:05 - it's working perfectly
658:07 - okay one more thing that I want to do
658:10 - okay so
658:12 - in the other
658:13 - profile image
658:15 - we don't need
658:17 - okay what is this
658:19 - let me make this a 60 or 40 let's see
658:22 - then
658:23 - okay not here okay this is the problem
658:25 - this
658:27 - okay profile image should be one place
658:30 - I mean somewhere else as well because
658:32 - this is breaking
658:36 - so it is not here let me come over to
658:41 - post update I mean post update
658:44 - and here we will have
658:47 - post okay this post image is breaking
658:50 - because
658:51 - we are having margin top 30. if you
658:54 - remove it will be fine
658:58 - I guess let's leave it
659:00 - okay maybe
659:03 - we need to add some
659:08 - uh we need to add some margin on this so
659:11 - make say I will make this as margin
659:14 - or maybe modal image just say model here
659:18 - and let me come over to this class name
659:21 - here and just same or dull
659:25 - margin 10 I mean margin top 30 PX
659:28 - now we will have margin here
659:30 - as 30 and now it will be fine
659:33 - okay now we have to do one more thing so
659:36 - let's say we type something like this
659:37 - hello
659:41 - this is Nishan
659:45 - now if you update or post it this will
659:48 - be here
659:50 - let's say
659:51 - where is it hello this is Nishant so
659:55 - what is happening what is happening here
659:57 - is
659:58 - we're not getting this in different
660:00 - lines
660:02 - so we have to make sure to do that
660:04 - so let me hover to
660:06 - react quill let me get this
660:08 - component
660:10 - I mean let me get this Library not
660:12 - component
660:14 - so let's install this in our
660:17 - app open up a new terminal
660:20 - and just paste it
660:23 - and let it finish let it finish yes
660:28 - so we will use this component
660:30 - at the place of our
660:33 - text area here
660:35 - so where is the text area
660:38 - which is this component post update in
660:41 - this we have to do
660:42 - so we will not have okay it's in the
660:45 - middle component
660:48 - modal com just murder this
660:51 - so instead of this text area where here
660:53 - we have aliosis react Queen
660:57 - so let me open this GitHub repo because
660:59 - it doesn't say how to use it
661:05 - so we can import react quill and its CSS
661:09 - file
661:10 - so let me add the quill here and import
661:13 - the CSS into the main
661:16 - file
661:20 - here
661:22 - like this now close and it will take
661:24 - some time to reload or
661:27 - optimize the dependencies I think it's
661:30 - done
661:32 - now we don't need this
661:34 - variable value
661:37 - so let me add it here
661:39 - or maybe we already have the value
661:42 - for this text area yes status
661:44 - so let me copy react quill
661:47 - and just add it here
661:49 - so
661:51 - let me add the class name of this tumori
661:53 - model input
661:55 - the value will be status
661:57 - and on January
661:59 - date status
662:01 - here so now we can remove digit text
662:04 - idea from here
662:06 - okay when now let's check
662:08 - if you open this
662:10 - you will get this but I think it's still
662:13 - optimizing now that I have added react
662:16 - quill here let me add some options I
662:19 - mean let me edit this
662:21 - so
662:22 - let me just find the class name that it
662:25 - has so open the console I mean not the
662:29 - console the elements tab here now let me
662:32 - click this button I mean the icon
662:34 - and focus on
662:36 - this input
662:39 - so this is called as
662:41 - he will container ql snow let me copy
662:45 - this class name
662:46 - add this in the model and remove the
662:50 - border so just make it as none
662:53 - so that the border of this disappears so
662:56 - we have to make it as important now we
662:59 - don't have the Border but still we can
663:01 - type it here
663:02 - the next thing we have to do is take I
663:04 - mean name of the border from this and
663:07 - this is called ql toolbar 12th no so
663:10 - copy this
663:12 - and simply add it here also it's now
663:14 - working we have the
663:17 - cool bar and this
663:19 - okay the next ring thing we can do is
663:23 - okay increase the height of this so say
663:25 - height
663:26 - 100 maybe 100 is too much let's say 50px
663:30 - or maybe 180 it's now it's very big and
663:34 - I guess we need that kind of big
663:37 - so
663:40 - it is here
663:41 - okay
663:43 - but this should be okay we don't need
663:45 - height here when the height on this
663:48 - container not on the toolbar so the add
663:52 - container here and say height as 150 PX
663:58 - yes also let me write font size say
664:02 - 20 PX
664:04 - okay it's not bigger
664:06 - do we have option to write a plus folder
664:08 - here in the react Queen let's check
664:11 - where is the quill quill quill quill
664:13 - quill here
664:15 - the placeholder
664:17 - say
664:19 - add some or say
664:21 - here something
664:25 - useful
664:29 - maybe we don't have the concept of
664:31 - placeholder here or maybe if we close
664:33 - this and refresh the page then open it
664:37 - again
664:38 - yes now we can say this
664:40 - yes we can type it here
664:43 - so in here let me make the font
664:46 - family as
664:48 - system UI
664:50 - and it will change
664:52 - so basically we can make it bold or
664:55 - italic or underline like this okay
664:58 - that's done
664:59 - now next thing we need to do is come
665:02 - over to post
665:04 - uh posts card here
665:07 - so here we have the P tag that contains
665:10 - the status
665:11 - so we don't need it here
665:14 - so remove this and we need a div make
665:18 - this
665:19 - PR div
665:21 - and here as well
665:23 - and just do
665:25 - this
665:27 - dangerously set in at HTML
665:30 - and add post dots I mean add this
665:35 - now
665:36 - the thing is okay we need double
665:40 - underscore HTML
665:42 - and then
665:44 - this and I think we need one more curly
665:46 - bracket
665:48 - now
665:49 - if you check
665:51 - we can say this the same thing that we
665:53 - have now let me
665:56 - write this here so hello
665:59 - I am Nishant
666:02 - Kumar
666:04 - maybe we have to make this on the
666:06 - different line like
666:07 - now click post
666:09 - and we will have this text here like
666:13 - this and it works
666:15 - maybe we need to decrease the width so
666:17 - the height to be one
666:19 - or maybe 100
666:20 - now
666:23 - yes I think 100 is fine let me add
666:26 - this again
666:30 - hello I am Nishant Kumar
666:33 - to add this here
666:35 - click post and this should be
666:39 - here
666:40 - where is it
666:42 - so I guess
666:44 - it's better to remove the height
666:46 - and
666:48 - go with it
666:50 - so let me add this
666:52 - click
666:53 - let me addition command to click post
666:57 - and let's search for it
667:01 - okay it still is not fine maybe this
667:05 - should be not
667:07 - they make it P again
667:10 - and
667:12 - then let's see what happens maybe we
667:14 - have to set the status
667:16 - here so
667:18 - let me check for status
667:20 - so here we have font
667:23 - okay we have margin here so remove it
667:26 - okay it doesn't work let me make margin
667:29 - top
667:31 - minus 20 PX
667:34 - okay this will not work okay so I guess
667:36 - that's fine and now we are fully
667:39 - functional LinkedIn clone that we can
667:42 - use
