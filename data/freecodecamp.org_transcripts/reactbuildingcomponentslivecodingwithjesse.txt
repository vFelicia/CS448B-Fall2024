00:07 - hey everybody is Jessie today we're
00:13 - going to build some reactive components
00:16 - let's see what we have so far since
00:21 - yesterday
00:23 - haven't really added that much I think I
00:25 - added a few more pages and some
00:27 - component names about it in some
00:29 - components I'll show you what's going on
00:32 - this is the reacts and if this is the
00:37 - react side so we have a component now
00:44 - for this hero section and we have a
00:47 - component for this this nav which is
00:50 - actually separate and for this sticky
00:53 - nav we also have a component for the
00:56 - footer so now we need to fill in some of
01:00 - the other stuff but you can see it looks
01:04 - nearly identical the only big change I
01:08 - want I want your opinion on this had a
01:13 - meeting this morning so I see I didn't
01:16 - get that much done between yesterday and
01:18 - today because today was filled mostly
01:20 - with meetings and paperwork and
01:23 - reviewing applications and we're hiring
01:28 - we're actually going to hire a web
01:29 - developer so if anybody's interested in
01:33 - that position you have web development
01:35 - experience let me know
01:38 - I guess send me send me a message on
01:42 - Twitter or I guess you put in the
01:49 - comments below if you're interested but
01:54 - I changed so in a meeting today it was
02:01 - mentioned that you know we wanted more
02:03 - of like a cursive type font so the font
02:09 - on the right is what we had and that's
02:13 - this
02:13 - same font that we're using for the that
02:15 - most of the H tags and then this is the
02:19 - font that I'm trying out I'm not really
02:25 - sure and at this point I'm ready to move
02:28 - on and not mess with fonts anymore so if
02:33 - you guys have an opinion about fonts let
02:35 - me know comment put in the live chat if
02:38 - you think there's another font that
02:40 - would be better let me know I'm I'm
02:42 - trying to stick you know with google
02:45 - fonts there's you know some free fonts
02:47 - they're widely available basically what
02:51 - I'm looking for is something similar to
02:53 - this like a handwriting font that's very
02:55 - let's say kind of formal and thin so if
03:01 - you have a font in mind the one on the
03:04 - rights more legible right okay so I was
03:09 - reading from the from the live chat we
03:12 - have some comments at the one on the
03:13 - right is more legible yeah I I like the
03:17 - one on the right but I think I'm gonna I
03:20 - don't know I might lose this one here
03:23 - and have to go with the font that looks
03:25 - more like this so we'll see maybe I'll
03:31 - try out a couple of fonts present them
03:33 - all at the next meeting and see you know
03:36 - see what people think so I mean I I do
03:39 - kind of like this one but sometimes you
03:44 - know you got to go you can't always make
03:46 - all the decisions on a site and other
03:48 - other people involved usually so thanks
03:51 - for the input
03:54 - yeah it looks like a lot of people like
03:58 - the one on the right we have some people
04:00 - who do like the one on the left okay all
04:04 - right I'm going to move these over so
04:07 - you can show you more what's going on if
04:14 - if you weren't watching yesterday I'll
04:17 - give you a quick recap we had a static
04:21 - website that we built and you just saw
04:23 - some of it on the screen when I show you
04:25 - the different fonts
04:28 - we're converting that website into a
04:31 - react website we install a react
04:33 - yesterday locally using next Jas which
04:39 - helps us install it very quickly we got
04:42 - everything installed and we actually had
04:44 - you know a page up and running in less
04:48 - than a half an hour so super quick I
04:51 - have links to all that in the show
04:55 - description so now the task is just to
04:59 - convert everything so next I'll show you
05:05 - what we have here next has a folder for
05:08 - pages and it handles all the routing for
05:11 - you if you put files in the pages folder
05:15 - so let me show you in this pages folder
05:20 - each one of these is going to be a
05:23 - different page and if I just if I go to
05:26 - that page and the address in the address
05:29 - bar it will just automatically route to
05:32 - that page very convenient and then your
05:36 - components can go in whatever folder you
05:38 - want I have an in folder named
05:39 - components and that's pretty much it
05:45 - next also handles server-side rendering
05:49 - which is awesome it does a lot of other
05:52 - cool stuff too and we'll probably get
05:54 - into more that as we build things out
05:58 - all right it seems like from the live
06:00 - chat everybody likes the one on the
06:03 - right all right at the next meeting I'm
06:06 - going to try really hard to convince
06:09 - everybody that we should go with the one
06:11 - on the right I think readability is
06:15 - probably the best reason I do think it
06:20 - looks better in general also it's one
06:23 - less font we have to load since we're
06:24 - already loading it so maybe I'll come in
06:28 - with some tangerine from hey that's
06:34 - awesome you know what that font was that
06:36 - is the tangerine fun that's crazy I
06:40 - don't know that I could
06:41 - just bought a font and know what it was
06:42 - right off the bat so that's you have a
06:47 - really good eye somebody in the last
06:50 - room knew exactly what this font was oh
06:56 - yeah they're saying less less font
06:59 - defend dependencies better performance
07:01 - that's that's what I'm thinking so okay
07:03 - I think I have some good reasons to make
07:04 - a case for the font that was on the
07:06 - right so I'm going to try that my next
07:09 - meeting
07:09 - actually I'm going to let you guys know
07:12 - next week I have meetings during my
07:16 - normal livestream time on Monday and
07:18 - Tuesday so Tuesday will be the next
07:20 - meeting we'll discuss this website then
07:24 - on Wednesday Thursday and Friday I'll be
07:26 - gone the syntax con conference in South
07:31 - Carolina is going to be that at the end
07:34 - of next week so I will be there I'm
07:36 - thinking about doing some live streams
07:39 - from the conference Oh we'll see how it
07:44 - goes I'm not really sure how the Wi-Fi
07:46 - is going to be so I may just do some
07:48 - recordings and then upload them when I
07:51 - get a chance to get somewhere with with
07:52 - good Wi-Fi but it might be cool to do
07:56 - some live streams so next week is going
07:58 - to be kind of a weird week I'm going at
08:00 - Monday and Tuesday I'll just reschedule
08:02 - the live streams for maybe earlier in
08:05 - the day and stuff like so many meetings
08:08 - coming up next week I don't know about
08:11 - you guys but I could code all day but
08:15 - you put me in a meeting for an hour and
08:17 - it just drains me so I don't know what
08:19 - it is about meetings
08:28 - all right let's get let's get back to
08:31 - this so I want to build some components
08:34 - so let's just pick out something to
08:36 - build so I already have some components
08:39 - built and I have other ones that I I
08:44 - don't have build at all so let's check
08:46 - out this team card so this one's blank
08:48 - this will be a nice one to build up so
08:51 - let me show you what we're going to
08:54 - build first and then we'll build it and
08:58 - you see it's it's super easy to convert
09:02 - existing HTML into a component depending
09:08 - on the amount of act you know
09:10 - interactivity that component has it
09:12 - could be a little bit more complicated
09:13 - but in this case what we're going to do
09:17 - is not going to be that complicated so
09:22 - let me bring this over okay so if you
09:28 - remember I don't know if I made these a
09:31 - lot I don't think I made these live but
09:33 - I'm pretty sure I at least showed this
09:35 - section okay I did do a video where we
09:38 - we made this little hide and show
09:40 - section so we have these cards at the
09:44 - meeting this morning
09:45 - these were big hit and the way this
09:48 - section works so I was happy about that
09:50 - because this was kind of the design of
09:53 - this was one of the most kind of made up
09:56 - parts I say that is I try to follow
09:58 - material design mostly but this kind of
10:02 - thing was not it's kind of off the path
10:05 - it's not really spelled out in material
10:07 - design so when I go out and get a little
10:11 - creative on my own like that it's always
10:13 - I don't know it's always a little
10:16 - stressful for me to see you know whether
10:18 - it's going to work or not but in this
10:20 - case it worked out we're actually going
10:22 - to convert another part of the site to
10:23 - use a similar system won't do that in
10:27 - this video but this is what we're going
10:29 - to take so let me find the code for this
10:31 - and we'll copy it over
10:39 - if someone's asked saying they need help
10:42 - with react native so yeah I haven't
10:45 - worked with react native yet I watch
10:48 - some videos on it and read about it and
10:50 - I'm super interested in it but I haven't
10:52 - had an opportunity to work with it and I
10:59 - should say this as well I am no expert
11:02 - on react I haven't built very many
11:05 - things with react I have built sites
11:06 - that are that are live that have
11:09 - launched that are working with react but
11:11 - I'm still very much learning a lot of
11:14 - the you know kind of the react way to do
11:17 - things so if you have used react
11:21 - I'm sure you'll spot some things that
11:24 - that I could be doing better and go
11:27 - ahead and let me know in the comments so
11:28 - let me know in the live chat if if you
11:32 - see something that could be done better
11:33 - I'll try to incorporate your suggestions
11:37 - I will have a repo up for this react
11:39 - site soon right now it just exists
11:42 - locally I'm actually not even tracking
11:44 - it with it at this point since I just
11:46 - started it but I will soon and as soon
11:49 - as I put that up I'll put the link to
11:51 - the new repo in the description for the
11:55 - video the repo for the static site that
11:58 - were we're converting is is up it is on
12:02 - github and you can check that up so on
12:05 - my other screen which you can't see I'm
12:07 - just finding the code that we wrote the
12:10 - the markup for those little cards for
12:16 - some reason my it's going a little slow
12:20 - so I apologize I'm like trying to scroll
12:22 - when it's just not it's not scrolling
12:25 - fast so I don't know I'm going to I
12:28 - actually went through today and closed a
12:30 - lot of the windows that I wasn't using
12:32 - but it's still giving me a little bit of
12:33 - trouble
12:36 - alright so we're going to grab
12:44 - I'll grab some of those code
12:53 - and actually let me paste just to help
13:01 - us out we'll copy this section over so
13:06 - you don't have to type all this up and
13:09 - we'll change the name so he says class
13:12 - you're going to use the name of your
13:14 - component two places up here at the top
13:18 - and then down here where you export it
13:20 - to name it here and then you export it
13:22 - here so we'll type in the name of team
13:26 - cards and now we'll copy in the mark-up
13:33 - now I'll show you there's just a few
13:35 - things that you absolutely have to
13:37 - change or you're going to get an error
13:46 - so you have some weird spacing things
13:49 - well I have a weird spacing things
13:52 - alright that looks better okay so when
13:57 - you copy over something in Iraq you
13:58 - can't use class you have to use class
14:02 - name so I'll go through everywhere where
14:06 - I've used class and just put class name
14:10 - at the end and also we have to have
14:15 - closing tags for everything so I'm glad
14:18 - this is in here this is a good example
14:20 - this image tag let me make this bigger I
14:23 - think I shrunk this down after the video
14:24 - yesterday to give me more space so they
14:28 - make this bigger there we go okay I'm
14:39 - kind of ignoring a live chat a little
14:41 - bit so I can get through this so I
14:43 - apologize for that I'll try to check
14:45 - back in a minute and see if there's any
14:47 - questions okay I just had this helmet
14:52 - it's as nice pasting by the way class
14:54 - name yet if you're not familiar with
14:57 - Adam it Adams not the only editor that
14:59 - can do this a lot other editors can but
15:02 - it has this cool feature which you know
15:05 - multiple cursors so I highlight the
15:07 - and an atom on Mac I press command-d and
15:11 - then it just keeps going down and and
15:14 - now I have all these cursors so I can
15:19 - type backspace you could even if if I
15:23 - had copied something I could paste it in
15:25 - there but I think the last thing I copy
15:27 - it was all that code if I tried to pay
15:28 - so now be a mess but it really comes in
15:32 - handy it saves a lot of time from having
15:34 - the you know edit those by hand you can
15:36 - accomplish a similar thing by you know
15:39 - find and replace but that just is a lot
15:42 - quicker at least for me if I had like
15:45 - hundreds of things I would I would do
15:48 - find a replace but if it's like 10 or or
15:52 - fewer then I use the multiple cursors so
15:57 - anyway this image tag will this will
15:59 - give me an error so actually let's let's
16:03 - just make it give the error first just
16:05 - to show you what it looks like again
16:07 - error and react and then we'll fix it so
16:09 - first I need to link this up right now
16:11 - this component exists but it's not
16:14 - linked up to any page so we need to put
16:16 - it in a page so the only page right now
16:19 - that I really have built out at all is
16:21 - this index page so if we'll see here at
16:26 - the top we're importing all the
16:28 - components that we need I don't know if
16:31 - there's an easier way to import these
16:33 - than one on each line if there is let me
16:36 - know because I would rather not have a
16:39 - separate line for every component but
16:42 - you can see all I'm doing is saying here
16:44 - what the name of the component is and
16:46 - then I'm saying where their component
16:48 - lives at in our file structure so we
16:52 - named our component team cards why don't
16:56 - I name it cards it should be singular
16:58 - what was I thinking this is going to bug
17:02 - lis so I'm just going to change it real
17:04 - quick because this is not going to be
17:07 - more than one card this is just one card
17:09 - so I'm going to say that I'm going to
17:14 - rename this
17:21 - okay now there we go
17:27 - okay so now that we've imported it here
17:29 - we're free to use it down here so inside
17:33 - of this this render function that's
17:36 - where we put our HTML so let's go ahead
17:40 - and throw this down below that sticky
17:42 - enough and all we're going to do is just
17:46 - put it in HTML tag team code and
17:53 - remember we have to close that up
17:55 - but in this case we are we're trying to
17:58 - get an error so I'm going to save this
18:00 - and then I'm going to bring over I'm
18:05 - going to bring this over okay let me let
18:08 - me make this Biggs you can see it's
18:11 - super small right now error messages in
18:14 - react are awesome they're very
18:16 - descriptive they tell you exactly where
18:18 - the error is so it says we have a syntax
18:26 - error they expected a closing tag for
18:30 - image and it tells you exactly where it
18:32 - is and then it actually shows you the
18:34 - code so it says you know basically it
18:38 - got to here and was confused because it
18:40 - didn't see what it expected to see so we
18:43 - can look back right before that we say
18:45 - okay we have this image tag and we never
18:48 - close that image tag so a lot of the
18:50 - times when you get an error in react it
18:52 - will be pretty easy to fix it so let's
18:58 - go back over here we'll go to our team
19:00 - card and let's just close this up all we
19:05 - have to do is just add that slash in and
19:07 - I'm going to save it and go back there
19:11 - we go okay so we see the team card right
19:16 - now we're not seeing the image because I
19:18 - need to change the image path okay but
19:21 - it's basically a team card the reason it
19:23 - looks all huge like this is because I
19:25 - didn't put it inside our container
19:29 - that's going to constrain its its width
19:33 - so I have to make a decision I guess
19:35 - whether I want the team card to come
19:38 - built in with that container or whether
19:41 - I want to put in that container in the
19:45 - page or maybe in another component I
19:50 - guess I don't have to make that decision
19:52 - right now the only reason I don't want
19:55 - to put the container here is I would
19:57 - rather have the freedom to use these
20:01 - cards in different sized containers so a
20:04 - half with container full with a third
20:08 - width of the page
20:22 - okay I'm saying Fabian in the live
20:27 - stream is putting in some stuff I'm not
20:33 - I'm not exactly sure what you're trying
20:36 - to say if Fabian so maybe leave a
20:39 - comment for me and explain it more okay
20:48 - so we have about 10 minutes left so
20:51 - let's fix this Wow okay I don't know why
20:56 - that image didn't work actually I had I
20:59 - just thought that I gave it the wrong
21:03 - path but this should work because it's
21:08 - not pointing to a local image it's
21:11 - pointing to this other website hmm all
21:17 - right I'm just going to inspect this
21:18 - quickly just to see and this is this is
21:29 - kind of the point of the the livestream
21:31 - is to show the times where things go
21:32 - wrong because I mean that's what
21:36 - realistic usually in my day-to-day work
21:41 - you know thinks things don't work like I
21:44 - want them to the first time you know
21:46 - sometimes that happens often and you
21:49 - gotta figure out what's going on hmm
22:00 - yeah I'm not exactly sure I'll show you
22:03 - what I'm what I'm seeing here I can make
22:08 - this a little bigger okay so maybe you
22:12 - see something that I don't see but this
22:14 - looks this looks like it should work
22:20 - maybe I could check okay I have crazy
22:24 - stuff going on now and the console
22:26 - I'll show you this error is coming from
22:31 - that sticky nerve I think this is
22:34 - because I keep resizing the screen and
22:36 - it's it it thinks the stickeen app
22:39 - should be there and it keeps looking for
22:41 - it so let me refresh to get rid of some
22:43 - of that and then we can look so you see
22:49 - I have all kinds of weird stuff
22:51 - happening if you guys know I mean some
22:55 - of these errors are obvious I'm just not
22:56 - loading in fonts where I should be right
22:59 - now which which is okay I'm not worried
23:00 - about that at this point I'm getting
23:03 - this error here this SW so like
23:07 - serviceworker I guess I'm not exactly
23:11 - sure what's going on with that error if
23:13 - anybody knows let me know in the
23:14 - comments and that would be helpful
23:17 - otherwise you know I'm going to look it
23:20 - up if this just happens in development
23:23 - and then on production it's not a big
23:25 - deal then I'm not that worried about it
23:27 - oh okay when we were trying to get this
23:33 - thing it resulted trying at that image
23:36 - resulted in a error the promise was
23:39 - rejected okay I'll figure that out later
23:43 - on yeah that's it this is fetch event
23:49 - network your response okay yeah you guys
23:52 - you guys saw it before I did so someone
23:55 - else named Jesse in the live stream saw
23:57 - that before I did okay somebody asked
24:03 - about the dark theme in the Google
24:04 - Chrome console as well and somebody
24:08 - mentioned react dev tools yeah I do have
24:10 - the react dev tools
24:12 - installed they are very helpful the dark
24:15 - theme you just go under the settings for
24:19 - dev tools there's a setting you can
24:22 - either pick the the light theme of the
24:24 - dark theme yes hello Jessie it's kind of
24:28 - weird to see my name in the in the
24:30 - stream but that's cool thanks for
24:35 - watching welcome alright so let's see if
24:39 - we can get in about five minutes if we
24:41 - can get another component built and
24:46 - maybe it might be cool to maybe make a
24:52 - component that imports another component
24:55 - so let me see if I have one zero four I
25:03 - might just have to make a new one let me
25:07 - go back here components let's uh let's
25:19 - make a not sure if I want this to be a
25:23 - component I need something like this at
25:29 - some point so let's try it out so we're
25:32 - going to make section did I not make
25:37 - yeah it showed up here okay it's going
25:40 - to make section a component first I'm
25:43 - going to copy this you see this is this
25:48 - is pretty much how I do components it's
25:50 - a lot of copying of just the boilerplate
25:52 - stuff so we don't have to retype it
25:57 - alright so the section component and
26:00 - what I want this to do I guess I could
26:03 - be faster from your copy I'm going to
26:05 - copy it from the other code
26:22 - okay so I'm gonna copy a lot of stuff
26:25 - and we're going to take some out so I
26:28 - just want the section
26:41 - you can see
26:47 - listen to anyone more okay um this will
26:59 - work and I just want it this is I'm
27:04 - going to be kind of more like a test
27:05 - section I'll probably use this at some
27:09 - point but I'll have to modify it to use
27:11 - it in the actual site but what I'm going
27:19 - to do is import that team card into this
27:23 - section and let's let's shrink it down a
27:28 - little bit let's let's do m6 so this
27:35 - will make it you know 50% of the width
27:38 - of a container and let's put in team
27:46 - card and then we need to import the team
27:51 - card so I'm going to copy the import
27:56 - from index 3 next page
28:09 - okay this I think this should work
28:14 - alright so we say that now let's go into
28:18 - our index page and let's bring in let's
28:26 - import this section and we'll just we'll
28:36 - add this in right above the regular team
28:40 - card okay so I'm going to say that it's
28:46 - going to refresh and we'll see if we
28:48 - have any errors where's my oh it's over
28:54 - here okay so it definitely worked I'm
29:03 - not exactly sure why the column thing
29:07 - didn't work I'm checking out and dev
29:12 - tools here so the section
29:38 - ah you guys probably caught what just
29:42 - happened I'll show you I left in these
29:47 - classes I'm actually really surprised
29:49 - that I didn't get any any error message
29:54 - popping up I probably did my console
29:57 - though so I need to put class name there
30:04 - lesson is it action is everything too
30:08 - big I can shrink it down a little bit
30:10 - let me know if you think the the font is
30:15 - too big and my editor I think that's
30:18 - what early you guys are talking about in
30:20 - the live chat ok let's see if this makes
30:24 - a difference yes there we go okay so you
30:29 - can see now we've actually put a
30:31 - component into another component and
30:35 - then added that component into a page
30:37 - and it's basically the same process all
30:40 - the way through you just have to make
30:42 - sure you import it you have to say where
30:45 - you're importing it from and then you
30:48 - include it down here make sure you have
30:51 - class maintenance at a class and make
30:53 - sure you close out all your tags name
30:59 - your component export your component and
31:03 - then when you go to put it on page make
31:06 - sure you import it again and then just
31:08 - put it where you want on the page now
31:11 - this is really simple what's going to
31:13 - end up happening though is at some point
31:17 - we're not just going to say teen card
31:19 - we're going to take this team card and
31:21 - we're going to put it like in a loop
31:25 - let's say so up here we'll actually
31:29 - import data from from an API we're going
31:34 - to use the WordPress API at some point
31:36 - so all our content is going to live in
31:39 - you know in WordPress we're going to
31:42 - call that and it's actually going to
31:43 - call it on the server render it on the
31:46 - server and it's just going to loop
31:48 - through and fill that data into the team
31:51 - cards as as much data as we have so
31:54 - we're going to end up with you know
31:55 - probably 100 cards we're going to sort
31:58 - them out by section you know by category
32:02 - but we only have to make the team card
32:05 - one time so whereas before let me see if
32:11 - I can show you let me show you the
32:16 - markup
32:16 - it's crazy long so the markup I just
32:25 - switched over this is the static site so
32:28 - you can see for that that same page
32:30 - where we have all those cards this is
32:35 - what it looks like that's a lot to keep
32:38 - track of we don't want to have to edit
32:40 - that so now to go back to react all that
32:46 - has turned into this just one time and
32:51 - then all this data is just going to be
32:53 - added in from the API and repeated so
32:59 - we're still going to get all the cards
33:00 - we need that you know the on the
33:02 - client-side and dev tools we would see
33:04 - all those but we don't have to mess with
33:06 - it all on our n so that's kind of the
33:14 - one one of the awesome things about
33:16 - react it's not like other things can't
33:19 - do this I mean this is basic templating
33:21 - stuff here but it is a nice thing a nice
33:27 - advantage if you're going to use react
33:29 - or some other templating system over
33:31 - just having everything you know static
33:33 - and and hand coded it's alright for
33:36 - maybe a one page or a small site but if
33:38 - you start getting a lot of repetitive
33:42 - elements on the page templating is the
33:45 - way to go all right I'm going to check
33:49 - the live chat real quick before we end
33:51 - just see if I can answer some questions
33:54 - you guys might have had so I'm going to
33:56 - scroll through
34:07 - alright somebody has a question any
34:09 - advice for landing a job after
34:11 - graduating from full-stack coding boot
34:13 - camp my advice would be apply for lots
34:17 - of jobs even if you don't think you meet
34:20 - all the requirements
34:21 - sometimes job descriptions are written
34:24 - by people in human resources who don't
34:26 - really know that much about the
34:28 - technology so they're just given a list
34:31 - of all the different things that a
34:34 - person might need they put them all on
34:36 - that list not realizing how crazy it
34:39 - sounds and really they don't need
34:41 - somebody who's an expert in all those
34:43 - things so I would recommend you know
34:46 - just just apply apply to places and
34:49 - always keep doing do side projects if
34:53 - you can get some freelance work that
34:54 - would be great but keep building up your
34:57 - portfolio and for your own website for
34:59 - your github profile and you know you'll
35:02 - you'll get a job there's a lot of you
35:04 - know developer jobs out there so if you
35:09 - just keep keep it up keep getting better
35:11 - and keep applying you'll get a job I
35:20 - just scroll down a little bit and I saw
35:22 - that somebody else said kind of the same
35:25 - thing try to pick up freelance works and
35:27 - contribute to project so I should have
35:31 - scrolled down a little bit more alright
35:33 - I'm getting almost to the end of the
35:35 - live chat okay you clarify it and said
35:43 - lesson on Chrome I'll remember that for
35:47 - the next live stream yeah to live
35:51 - streams ago everybody said make it
35:53 - bigger so now I made it too big
36:02 - somebody's asking about the time it
36:04 - takes to make a website that's entirely
36:06 - dependent on what kind of website it is
36:08 - how much content you know what it needs
36:10 - to do it's entirely possible to make a
36:14 - one page website in a day depends on
36:18 - what you're starting with why there's so
36:25 - many coming soon challenges in free code
36:27 - camp I don't actually make the challenge
36:30 - I don't work on those challenges so I'm
36:33 - not exactly sure I know you know they
36:36 - want to test them thoroughly and make
36:37 - sure that they're ready to go before
36:39 - they release them but here as somebody
36:44 - also said you can test the challenges on
36:47 - the beta site if you want to someone
36:53 - else had a question about Java on free
36:55 - code camp there is no Java on free code
36:59 - camp not not that I know of and I'm not
37:04 - sure somebody just asked why don't they
37:05 - offer it I'm not sure why it free code
37:09 - camp they focus on kind of a small set
37:16 - of things so no there's a lot of other
37:19 - places out there where you you kind of
37:21 - similar to the style free code can being
37:24 - able to do most of it in your browser
37:25 - and things like that they do offer it
37:29 - Java courses ok I think I got through
37:34 - everything and all the questions if I
37:36 - missed your question put it in the
37:38 - comments and I'll get to it later on let
37:42 - me know if there's anything I need to
