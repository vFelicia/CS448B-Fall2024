00:03 - hi in this video we are going to be
00:05 - talking about the console what it is
00:08 - where you can find it and what you use
00:09 - it for now the console is very commonly
00:13 - used to display system administrative
00:15 - messages your browser has a console your
00:18 - computer has a console once you become
00:20 - more familiar with it you'll find it to
00:22 - be a really powerful and effective
00:24 - tool in JavaScript the console is used
00:27 - as a great tool for debugging and
00:29 - finding out where in your code there's a
00:31 - problem one of the most important words
00:34 - you're going to need to remember is
00:37 - console.log now console is the thing
00:39 - that shows the text. log means log it
00:42 - here write it here then there's some
00:44 - parentheses and you can write whatever
00:46 - you want uh now the process of doing
00:49 - this can be put anywhere in the lines of
00:52 - code just like in the last video we go
00:54 - down sequentially you can put some kind
00:56 - of statements that say you know if this
00:58 - doesn't work console laog this is broken
01:00 - online 43 or whatever you need to do to
01:03 - help yourself figure out what the
01:05 - problem is and where it's
01:06 - happening all right what you see here is
01:09 - the Chrome browser with the Chrome
01:11 - console the console can also be up on
01:13 - the side but we're going to keep it down
01:15 - below for now you are probably also
01:18 - seeing this
01:19 - console.log we are going to console log
01:21 - a string a string is inside quotes or
01:24 - single quotes like this uh let's
01:27 - console free code Camp Rocks now if we
01:32 - run this code right here now here it's
01:36 - false that's what it's returning to this
01:38 - but down here in the console you see
01:41 - free code Camp Rocks awesome right now
01:44 - we can also console a number like
01:49 - 1,24 and there it is and we can also
01:52 - console a Boolean which is a true or
01:54 - false statement do console log true and
01:56 - it's going to say true if we try and say
01:58 - a word like uh words and console log
02:03 - that it's nothing's going to happen that
02:05 - doesn't recognize words because it
02:06 - doesn't know if it's a string or what
02:08 - but once you put it inside of some of
02:10 - these guys then it knows what we're
02:11 - talking about you can also combine
02:13 - things so say I want to say console log
02:17 - uh
02:17 - Briana is and then true we'll see what
02:22 - happens there we get Brian is true you
02:25 - can see the color differentiation here
02:27 - if your screen's big enough uh if not it
02:29 - just says is and then true is in blue
02:31 - because that's a Boolean as opposed to
02:32 - the string uh you can use this in a
02:35 - bunch of different ways but this is what
02:36 - console really looks like
