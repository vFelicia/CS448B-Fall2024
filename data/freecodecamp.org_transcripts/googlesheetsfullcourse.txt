00:00 - Barton Paulson is a university professor and 
excellent instructor. In this course, he will turn  
00:05 - you into an expert in Google Sheets, spreadsheets 
are a lot more useful than many people think.  
00:12 - And don't forget to like and subscribe to 
the Free Code camp.org YouTube channel.  
00:17 - Welcome to Google Sheets, what I want to tell you 
is that data loves spreadsheets. And that really,  
00:23 - you could learn to love them too. Now, you may 
not think of yourself as a data kind of person.  
00:28 - But the important thing to know 
about data is no matter what you do,  
00:32 - data gives you a map, it helps you find your 
way. And you may wonder, a map to what Well,  
00:39 - that depends on what your goals are. They might 
be professional, organizational, social, personal,  
00:46 - political. But whatever it is you're interested 
in data can help you do it better. For instance,  
00:51 - if you have a business, it can help you figure 
out what work that you do is most popular with  
00:56 - paying clients. It can help you figure out what 
brings people back to your nonprofit organization,  
01:02 - who can help you say what attracts new 
people to your political organization,  
01:06 - it may help you figure out what's the best 
use of time in your own personal life.  
01:10 - And it can even help you figure out important 
questions like how much should you charge for  
01:14 - your work or your services? So data is a method 
of approaching any one of these questions. But  
01:22 - what does that have to do with Google Sheets? 
Well, Google Sheets lets you do several different  
01:27 - things that are really important with data. 
First and foremost in Google Sheets gives  
01:33 - your data a home. Now you know where your stuff 
is. And you can find it, you can search for it,  
01:40 - you can share it with other people, you get it 
centralized. And now you can do something useful  
01:45 - with it. And then what what are those things that 
you're going to do? Well, there's a few things  
01:52 - that you can do with Google sheets that are really 
helpful. Number one is you can graph your data,  
01:57 - you can explore your data, think of yourself as an 
explorer, you're out there in really a new area,  
02:02 - and you're trying to find out what's all around 
you. And what's the best way forward. And Google  
02:09 - Sheets, you can do that with graphs 
like this multiple variable timeline,  
02:13 - it can help you find the places of greatest value, 
and help lead you in that particular direction.  
02:21 - Google Sheets can also help you sort and filter 
through your data. Now, you got a collection  
02:28 - of tea bags, put them in little boxes, it makes 
it easier to see what you have, and also to see  
02:33 - what you're missing. In the data world. You can 
sort your data by whatever categories you want,  
02:40 - you can filter it here, I'm filtering by a couple 
of different categories. If you've got a business,  
02:45 - you can find new clients that are in your database 
and focus on them. Or you can find open accounts,  
02:51 - and you can focus on them and take care of it. And 
once you find the data that's most important to  
02:56 - you, you can calculate things about that data. 
And you can summarize it really, it's a way of  
03:01 - bringing things in to focus. The entire point of 
data analysis is to simplify things in a way that  
03:10 - helps you reach practical goals, you want to bring 
it into focus. Sometimes the focus analogy really  
03:17 - can be pretty literal. Here I have a set of almost 
1400 numbers, and it's completely overwhelming.  
03:24 - But over here on the right, you can see that the 
mean, the average is 547.5. The maximum is 999.  
03:31 - I've got conditional formatting that highlights 
where those 999 are, and also where the minimum  
03:37 - values of 100 are. It helps you sort through the 
haystack and find the needles are going to be of  
03:42 - most use to you. Finally, believe it or not 
spreadsheets and Google Sheets can help you  
03:49 - work creatively. Now, not necessarily to create 
your own art. But if you're an artist, you will  
03:55 - find out that Google Sheets can help you free up 
some time and some cognitive bandwidth to focus on  
04:02 - the things that are most important to you. And you 
can be creative in spreadsheets. Here's one that I  
04:07 - use when planning a big trip around the world with 
my family, I actually had to get a spreadsheet to  
04:12 - help figure out who was going to sit where on all 
of the plane rides. Or you can use a spreadsheet  
04:18 - to help you make a decision about what you want 
to focus on in your business to help you reach  
04:22 - both your personal and professional goals. I'll 
give you examples of all of these things. And  
04:28 - as you go through the course you can follow 
along by downloading the files that we have  
04:32 - at this address, data lab.cc slash tools 
slash je s h that stands for Google Sheets.  
04:40 - 01. So that's data lab.cc slash tools slash je s 
h 01. Download the sheets, follow along and really  
04:51 - try Google Sheets and what you'll 
find is that it's going to help you  
04:55 - listen to your data and find your way in your own 
work. Thanks for joining me I'm excited to have  
05:00 - you here. And I'm excited to hear from you about 
how working with data in a simple tool like Google  
05:07 - Sheets can help you find better value in your own 
work. Before we really get started in this course,  
05:13 - there's one important piece of advice, I 
always have to tell everybody. And that is,  
05:19 - when you're working with data, always do 
pictures first. The idea is you want to  
05:26 - take a look at your data, see what's in front 
of you get the context, get the big picture,  
05:31 - maybe zoom in on some smaller things, but you need 
to start with a visual analysis. In other words,  
05:38 - first graphs, then numbers. As far as I'm 
concerned, the graphs are the analysis, and  
05:45 - the numbers are simply a way of lending precision 
to the numbers. I always tell my students when I  
05:51 - teach statistics, that every single thing we do in 
the class can be done visually, you can graph it,  
05:58 - or you can calculate it with numbers as 
possible to, but graphs and visuals come first.  
06:05 - Now, I can't talk about this without 
sharing the world's best known example,  
06:09 - within the statistics community is called an 
scums, quartet, statistician, Charles hands come  
06:15 - back in the 70s, somehow found a set of data 
that did something very unusual. We have four  
06:21 - small set of data here. And what you need to see 
is that these summary statistics on the bottom,  
06:26 - the sample size, the mean, that's the average, the 
standard deviation, and measure of how spread out  
06:30 - things are the correlation between the two 
variables. And the regression equation with  
06:36 - the slope and the intercept. See those numbers 
right there, they're the same as those numbers,  
06:41 - right? There are the same as those numbers, right? 
There are the same as those numbers right there.  
06:46 - So based on a cursory numerical analysis, 
these four data sets are identical.  
06:55 - On the other hand, when you graph it, 
you see, it doesn't really hold up.  
07:00 - Here's the first set of data, this is a nice 
normal looking regression equation, things  
07:06 - are scattered around a little bit on this line. 
This is what we're expecting in regular analysis.  
07:13 - On the other hand, the second pair of variables 
has this really clear but curved relationship?  
07:20 - Now, the kind of analysis we usually 
do is looking for straight lines,  
07:23 - because that's the simplest possible way of 
describing an association between two things.  
07:29 - You can draw a straight line through this, 
but you're doing damage to the relationship,  
07:33 - because really, you need to be modeling the 
curve. There are ways to do that. But they're  
07:37 - relatively advanced. And I personally, 
I've never had to deal with them.  
07:42 - The third set of variables, you see, we've got 
this really strong straight line where we've got  
07:47 - one number, oop, that's popping up. And it's 
an outlier. And the immediate question is,  
07:52 - what's going on with that number? Why is it 
Adeline? Because if you're doing for instance,  
07:56 - a manufacturing process that might indicate 
something's broken, it might just be a sensor,  
08:01 - that would be nice. But it could be something 
about the manufacturing process. Again, our  
08:07 - standard approach doesn't deal well with outliers 
and anomalies. And so you got to be careful about  
08:13 - that. And then the last one set for is a very 
bizarre, really kind of a pathological data set,  
08:19 - where all of the numbers are jammed over here 
on the left with this one extreme outlier on the  
08:25 - right, which would normally be an indication 
that something has gone terribly, terribly  
08:30 - wrong in the data gathering. And so simply by 
looking at them, you can see that there's an  
08:36 - enormous difference, even though, based on common 
statistical measures, they were identical. Now,  
08:45 - these are artificial datasets, Charles anscombe, 
had to work very hard to find these four sets  
08:50 - of data, but diverged so much graphically. But 
closer to real life. There are other reasons why  
08:56 - you would want to do a graphical analysis first. 
So for instance, take this, this is potential  
09:02 - data about donations to a nonprofit organization 
by month. And you can see that on the left side,  
09:08 - things are motoring along kind of fine, 
about 5000 bucks a month, great. And then  
09:12 - suddenly, halfway through it more than doubles, 
and it settles down a little bit, then it goes  
09:17 - up another 10,000 and it settles down, then it 
goes up another 10,000. And then it drops by 50%.  
09:25 - The graphical analysis, just a simple line 
here, lets you know, we've got things going  
09:30 - on. And we need to figure out what's making 
a jump up at each of these times, guys,  
09:35 - maybe we can do more of that. And then also 
what making it drop off so much at the end.  
09:40 - This is the way that even a visual analysis 
can guide the follow up questions and can guide  
09:47 - the actions that you take within your 
organization as a way of better understanding  
09:53 - what's happening and allowing you to maximize your 
effectiveness and your efficiency and reach Your  
10:00 - own goals. And besides, there's another thing, 
people are very good at visual analysis. It's a  
10:08 - high information density medium. And so 
by getting a picture by getting visuals,  
10:15 - you're going to get a lot more insight than 
you could with simple tables of numbers.  
10:20 - So the moral of all of this is simply always start 
by looking. Remember, begin with graphs, and then  
10:28 - follow them up with any numerical analysis that 
you want to do. In doing so, you'll get a lot more  
10:34 - insight. And you'll avoid a lot more problems 
on the way of getting to the information that  
10:39 - you need. If we're going to be on the same page 
and understand what we're talking about in here,  
10:44 - we need to talk a little bit about the anatomy of 
a spreadsheet. So the vocabulary that I use when  
10:50 - describing it can make some sense. First thing 
is, the actual document that we're in, in Google  
10:57 - Sheets is just called a spreadsheet. In Microsoft 
Excel is called a workbook. And a spreadsheet can  
11:02 - consist of more than one page, each of which has a 
tab down here at the bottom. And Excel, these are  
11:09 - called worksheets. And then Google Sheets, they're 
just called sheets. And that's where you actually  
11:15 - do your work. Now, each sheet consists of a number 
of columns, vertical columns, that have letters to  
11:22 - indicate what column you're in, this is column D, 
right here. And they have rows that are numbered,  
11:29 - row number one, row number two. And what that 
means is that at the intersection of each column,  
11:35 - and each row is a cell. So right here, I've got 
one cell, that's one box, one data container,  
11:43 - within a Google Sheet, that can put something 
in it, and it has an address, this is cell  
11:50 - B, two. So you always give the column 
name letter first, that's B in this case,  
11:57 - and the row number second, B to this here is C 
three, this right here is B six, this is a four.  
12:06 - And so that's the address, you have cells that 
make a spreadsheet that are arranged in vertical  
12:13 - columns and horizontal rows. Now, there's a lot 
of other things you can do here. One thing is I  
12:19 - showed you, you can have multiple tabs. And those 
allow you to have different kinds of information,  
12:25 - or arrange things in different ways on each one. 
Each tab also has a little drop down arrow right  
12:31 - next to it that allows you to do things like 
duplicate the tab or change the color of the tab.  
12:36 - There we go. Now we've got a little bit of color 
right there, I'm going to turn that off actually.  
12:43 - Or to see a list of all the tabs, that's good, 
if you've got a lot of them or to add a new tab,  
12:49 - add a sheet. And then when you come 
up to the top of the spreadsheet,  
12:55 - Now a lot of times the first row is for the 
names of the columns, the variable names,  
13:00 - and you might want that to stay where it is. 
So if you scroll up, it doesn't disappear.  
13:05 - You can do that by freezing a row or you can 
also freeze columns. And that means that they  
13:10 - will stay there. Now there's a few different ways 
to do that. One of them is to come up here to view  
13:16 - and hit freeze and say the first row or the first 
two rows or wherever I am right now, and columns,  
13:22 - I personally find it easier to come over here and 
get this little thick line right here. And when it  
13:27 - turns into a hand, you just click on that and drag 
it down. And now the thick lines right here, and  
13:32 - you can see that when I scroll up and down, that 
first row will stay put, you can do the same thing  
13:37 - with columns. If you want, for instance, this 
one to always show column A, just come over here  
13:44 - until you are have a little hand and then drag it 
over. And now column A will always show and that's  
13:52 - called freezing rows and columns. And it's a way 
of making it easier to navigate your spreadsheet.  
13:59 - Also, when you come up to the top here, you'll 
find that you have a little drop down menu that  
14:06 - shows up in each of these, including the ability 
to sort an entire sheet by values in a column.  
14:14 - So I can click this. And now it sorts the entire 
sheet by this column right here. If I want to get  
14:20 - back to where I was, I could either do undo or I 
could just come and sort by a different variable.  
14:25 - I sort by ID sort from ascending values from A to 
Z, you can also sort descending that from Z to A.  
14:35 - You also have a number of toolbars. Up 
here. Those are familiar with any other  
14:39 - program you've been using. There is one special 
function I do want to draw to your attention.  
14:44 - And that is way down here in the bottom 
corner. We have something that sometimes  
14:49 - called a quick sandbox, and what it is, 
let me highlight a few numbers here.  
14:55 - I've highlighted some numbers. And now when 
I come down here, you'll see it gives mean  
15:00 - the sum, I actually use this a lot. If I'm 
putting in dollars, I'm putting in values,  
15:05 - I can get an immediate, somebody just dragging 
over a few numbers and getting their total.  
15:09 - You can also click on it and see a whole lot of 
other things, the average the minimum maximum,  
15:14 - the count the number of scores and the number of 
numbers, there's only numbers here, so we're fine.  
15:20 - But that's a way to get immediate information 
without even having to write a formula.  
15:24 - So the important thing is a spreadsheet 
consists of individual sheets, or pages,  
15:30 - each of which has cells that are arranged into 
vertical columns, which are named with letters,  
15:35 - and horizontal rows, which are named with numbers. 
And as we go through the other videos, in this  
15:41 - course, you'll see there's a huge number of things 
you can do within each document in Google Sheets.  
15:47 - More than anything, a spreadsheet, 
like Google Sheets is a container  
15:53 - for data. And one of the important things to 
remember is that data comes in lots of different  
15:58 - forms. A lot of it's numerically based, but even 
then you can format it in many different ways.  
16:03 - And there is also non numeric data. And Google 
Sheets can handle a huge amount of this. And I  
16:09 - want to show you some of those variations. So 
you know what you can put in and adapt to your  
16:14 - own purposes. The most obvious one, of course, is 
just plain old numbers, like this integer 1587,  
16:22 - you put those in there, Google Sheets will usually 
put them flush, right text is usually flush left,  
16:28 - you can type those in, you can get a lot of 
it is just those kinds of counting numbers.  
16:35 - On the other hand, you can also get proportions 
which are red like percentages. So this is 0.87  
16:42 - is the same as 87%. In fact, if 
you want to see it as a percentage,  
16:46 - you can just take that proportion, and you 
can click here on the format is percent key,  
16:51 - there it is, it even gives you two 
decimal places. But it's obviously 87%.  
16:57 - You also have the option of just typing 
it in as 87%. I'll do it like this.  
17:07 - And that also works as a percent. If I press the 
percent sign there, now you see how it works.  
17:12 - Now, there's one thing you don't want to 
do, and that is type in the number 87.  
17:16 - And then think if you do this is going to 
turn it into 87%, it turns it into 80 700%,  
17:22 - which is obviously not what you want. 
So you need to start with a proportion,  
17:26 - the point eight, seven, and 
it turns it into percentages.  
17:30 - You can also put in the number like pi and you 
can decrease the decimals, which is good because  
17:35 - pi has infinite decimals. So it can make 
a little smaller if you want. Or if you  
17:41 - have a number with a lot of decimals already 
entered. And I'm using the PI function here,  
17:46 - you can increase the decimals, I don't know that 
you really need a lot more, but they're available  
17:51 - if you want them. Now often the information you're 
going to be entering into a spreadsheet is going  
17:56 - to be financial, you can have money, you're going 
to be keeping track of purchases and payments.  
18:02 - And you have several different options. One is 
the accounting format. So if you're an accountant,  
18:07 - you're familiar with this, but you come up 
to format to number and then come down here  
18:12 - to accounting. And what it does is it puts the 
comma in for the 1000, it puts the dollar sign  
18:20 - way over here. Okay, that's pretty easy. You 
can also do financial formatting, which is  
18:26 - similar in certain ways, I'll come down here. And 
you'll see it puts in the comma. But otherwise, it  
18:34 - doesn't have the dollar sign in it 
formats a little bit differently.  
18:38 - And there's also currency. And you can 
set your local currency in Google Sheets.  
18:46 - I'm going to use dollar, that's where I am. And so 
you can see now it puts a little bit differently.  
18:52 - And it's three different ways of representing the 
same information. Now, I realized they're slightly  
18:58 - different each other, it becomes a little more 
pronounced when you make the numbers negative.  
19:03 - So I'm going to put a negative there. And now 
you see it puts it in parentheses, that's a  
19:08 - common thing in accounting. And with financial, it 
also puts it in parentheses. But when it comes to  
19:14 - currency, I put in a negative it sticks in front 
of the dollar sign. So a few different ways of  
19:19 - dealing with money, depending on what's the most 
common practice in the work that you do. You can  
19:25 - also put in dates, you just type them in seven 
slash 16. It'll format them, and then I'll show  
19:31 - you in another video, there's a lot you can do 
with dates in Google Sheets. And you can also use  
19:37 - time so for instance, 10 1031, just enter it as 
hours and then colon, minutes, colon, and seconds.  
19:46 - So those are all numbers. And there's a lot of 
things you can do with numbers. But Google Sheets  
19:50 - is able to handle a lot more than that it's able 
to handle well. For instance, it can handle text,  
19:57 - so you can just type in words and it It turns out, 
there's a lot of functions that allow you to deal  
20:02 - with words. And I'll give you examples of those 
in a later movie. You can put in web links, if you  
20:08 - type in a valid web address, I just typed in data 
lab.cc, my address, it recognizes that as HTTP,  
20:16 - although it should be HTTPS, because I have 
an SSL certificate. And those are live links,  
20:23 - you can click on them, and it'll take you there. 
So here, for instance, I have my website data lab  
20:29 - now opening because I had it here in the cell, the 
same thing works, you can put email addresses in  
20:35 - there, it'll work a lot of different ways. You can 
put web data, this is an interesting one, this is  
20:42 - a special function that calls in Google Finance 
data. So this is today's stock price for Google  
20:50 - $1,066 a share. And by the way, notice that we get 
this little disclaimer down here at the bottom,  
20:58 - if I were to delete that the disclaimer would 
go away. Of course, you can use formulas,  
21:03 - and I've used a few of them already and have a 
lot more say about formulas. So for instance,  
21:08 - the formula that pulls up this data is 
Google Finance, and then in parentheses in  
21:14 - quotation marks at Google, because that's the 
symbol for Google on financial markets. And  
21:20 - one other interesting thing you can do in Google 
Sheets he can't do in every spreadsheet, is you  
21:26 - can include images. Now, this is an image that is 
on the web, it's it's my company logo, and you do  
21:34 - image and then you put the URL for that image in 
quotes. Nice thing is, if I make this cell bigger,  
21:42 - that you know it increases in size as well. So 
you can put an image in a cell, if you can link  
21:48 - it from a URL, put that one back to where it was. 
And then finally, you have the option of including  
21:57 - floating images and a number of other things. Let 
me give you an example of that. I'm going to come  
22:02 - right here to insert, you can put in a chart, an 
image, a drawing a form, checkboxes, columns, and  
22:08 - I'll talk about a lot of those. Let me just insert 
an image for right now, the one thing you need to  
22:14 - know, when you include an image, I'm just gonna 
get one off on my desktop, I got my data lab icon,  
22:21 - the one thing you need to know is that 
it's a floating image. And so it's not  
22:25 - in the cell, you can drag it around, it's 
also really big, I'm gonna make it smaller.  
22:31 - So it's not linked to this cell. And that's a 
little different from this web image that we have  
22:36 - in the cell. But it is possible to include 
this information, especially if you're  
22:41 - trying to build up a repository or even have 
a sort of a branding with your spreadsheets,  
22:46 - it gives you many different options. 
And so what you can see from all of  
22:51 - this is that Google Sheets is able to serve as a 
container for a lot of different kinds of data,  
22:57 - each of which might arise in different 
circumstances in your own work.  
23:03 - Once you have your data in Google Sheets, you have 
a lot of options for how you format the data. Now,  
23:09 - this is mostly cosmetic in terms of changing the 
appearance of the data. But it's also something  
23:14 - that can help you organize the data that makes 
it much easier to follow the argument and bring  
23:22 - things to your attention. Let me give you some 
of the really obvious things if you've ever used  
23:26 - a computer before, this is going to be familiar. 
So first off is you get to change the font. The  
23:32 - default font in Google Sheets is Arial, which is 
very clean, it works well in a lot of situations.  
23:39 - On the other hand, maybe you want a 
different font, maybe you want something like  
23:43 - source meal goudy. That's one that I like. 
And you come up here and you click on fonts,  
23:49 - and you go to source meal. And now you may not 
have that because it's not installed by default.  
23:54 - If it's not, you just go to more font that takes 
you to a web page and you can add a huge number of  
24:00 - fonts. Don't add all of them because then it gets 
confusing, but find something that you need work  
24:05 - for your purposes. And you can add it in here and 
it becomes available and it becomes available to  
24:11 - anybody who uses your document. Another option 
is something like consolas if you're using  
24:19 - code, a fixed width font is pretty common. You 
can change the font size so you can make it  
24:27 - smaller 10 point by default eight point is well, 
I've got my screen zoomed in super big so it's  
24:33 - not too hard to see. It make a lot bigger. And 
obviously this is something you might want to do  
24:39 - if you are putting in headings or titles. Now, 
one thing to be aware of is you're not limited  
24:45 - to the choices that are here. So for instance, 
I put 20 points, but I only had 24 points just  
24:51 - come up here, select the number and type 
what you want. There's a 20 point font  
24:58 - you can also do the bold I got to do is do 
Command or Control B, or you can click on that  
25:05 - same thing with a tallix. Just come 
up here, you can do the other command  
25:13 - and strike through, I don't use strike through 
very often, but it might be important for your  
25:16 - purposes. Okay, those are all quick and easy. The 
next one is text color. Obviously, if you've used  
25:22 - a computer before you know how to do this stuff. 
But color can be an important indicator of both  
25:28 - importance and directing focus. And that can be 
really important when you're putting together  
25:33 - visualizations or making a table that you're 
going to have to come back to and you need  
25:38 - help interpreted or you're sharing it with other 
people. So I can come down and select the color,  
25:44 - there's red text, you can also do fill 
color, that's an option. So if I do the fill,  
25:53 - it puts in the cell. Now, by the way, when you 
have a dark fill like this, you usually want  
25:59 - to come and pick white text to go on top of 
it. So it's easier to tell what's going on.  
26:05 - You can do cell borders, and I do these only 
lightly, I tried to keep it pretty clean.  
26:12 - To do cell borders, select the cells that you 
want to have borders on, and then come up to the  
26:17 - borders. And you know, you can put cells borders 
on everything. But that's kind of a nightmare,  
26:22 - you don't want to do that. There are times I 
have find, however, that it's nice to have just  
26:27 - horizontal lines going through the data, it's 
relatively easy to direct the line across the  
26:34 - rows in a table, especially when it's printed. 
I'm going to take that out for right now. But cell  
26:40 - borders are an option. row height, you can snap 
it to fit or you can have a consistent size. Now,  
26:46 - snap to fit means something that happened 
automatically here, you saw how that got bigger,  
26:51 - I can drag it down. So it's super huge, or I 
can bring it back up. Either way, you saw when  
26:56 - I changed the font size, it automatically changed 
the height of the row so that the text would fit.  
27:03 - Similar to that you have options for column width, 
you can snap to fit or do a consistent size. This  
27:10 - actually requires a small 
demonstration. So I'm going to put  
27:14 - three column headings here. And I'm going to 
make them bold, because I often find it's helpful  
27:19 - to have column headings in bold, and they're 
different sizes. If you want to snap to fit,  
27:25 - you can just select these three columns, 
and then double click here on the right one.  
27:31 - And then it changes the width of each column so 
that it adjusted the size of the text, there may  
27:38 - be situations in which you want to do that. On 
the other hand, I find that having different  
27:42 - size columns can be a little disturbing. So you 
can also do a consistent size. So for instance,  
27:48 - I can select all three of them here. And I can 
make all of them the size of this last one. If  
27:54 - I just click this and drag it around a little and 
I let go, now all of them will be the same size.  
28:00 - And that usually is easier to read because you 
have this uniform movement across the document.  
28:08 - In addition to that, and maybe this is a solution, 
you can do text alignment. Now all the text that  
28:13 - I've got right here so far, is flush left, 
you can of course come over here and you can  
28:19 - center it, you can also make it flush right by 
text is usually flush left, and that works best.  
28:25 - On the other hand, if you're doing a column, 
you may want to have centered text for columns,  
28:32 - especially with the columns are different 
sizes, that makes things a little easier,  
28:35 - you also have the option of changing vertical 
alignment. But to make that clear, let me show you  
28:40 - one other thing. And that is text wrapping where 
it says overflow wrap and clip. So let's make  
28:47 - this a little more obvious by making all of these 
smaller, narrower. Okay, so you see how this one  
28:54 - that says extra extra extra long is now too big, 
one of the options I have is to come right here  
29:00 - and to change it so that it is wrapped. 
And that has it you know, go to two lines,  
29:08 - it is not breaking very well if I put 
in a space here, it should break better.  
29:16 - Because it treats it as a single word. There we 
go. Now it's breaking better. On the other hand,  
29:23 - maybe you want these other ones on the bottom, 
but maybe you want to vertically orient them  
29:27 - towards the top towards the middle. 
Anyhow, whatever works best for your  
29:32 - purposes. These are a lot of different ways that 
you can format the document again, the point here  
29:39 - is not to noodle away your time and just kind of 
mess with it because you can't, but the point of  
29:43 - it is to organize the document to make it clearer. 
You want clarity and you want direction you want  
29:49 - to guide the eye through your document to make the 
comprehension and analysis easier. And formatting  
29:56 - even with a small range of options is going to 
make that a lot easier to Do in Google Sheets.  
30:02 - When you're getting ready to work with your data, 
you'll find that your life becomes a lot easier  
30:06 - if you have tidy data. Now, this kind of a funny 
term, but it actually refers to something specific  
30:13 - within the data science world, I want you to 
know that if you go to Google and type in tiny  
30:18 - data, to the first three are going to take you 
directly to the journal article in the Journal  
30:25 - of statistical software by Hadley Wickham, that 
originally explained the idea of tidy data.  
30:31 - And you can also take you to a page on the our 
project site that gives a lot more information  
30:38 - about what is meant by tidy data. The idea is 
that data that is tidy is easier to manipulate  
30:44 - and is easier to take from one software package 
to another. Now, this is where spreadsheets are  
30:51 - a little problematic, because spreadsheets are 
amazingly flexible. And they allow you to do  
30:58 - a lot of things that might suit your purposes when 
you're reading this spreadsheet, but they make  
31:02 - exporting or sharing with others kind of 
a headache. So for instance, I've got a  
31:08 - spreadsheet right here, that does some of the 
things that I hope you don't have to deal with.  
31:13 - First and foremost, we've got a problem here of 
merged cells. This is when you take a single cell  
31:20 - and you spread it all the way across these other 
ones sort of as a header, there's a merge cell,  
31:24 - there's a merge cell. This one is 15 cells 
merged together, and it's smack in the middle of  
31:30 - everything. The problem with these is they change 
the way the spreadsheet function. So for instance,  
31:35 - if I come here and click on column F, you 
see it's selecting this entire first cell,  
31:41 - and then it's selecting all of this. But if I 
then hit bold, it only changes this one. And if  
31:47 - I try to hit bowled back, it doesn't do anything I 
have to do undo. And if I were to try to move it,  
31:55 - I'm just gonna come right here and 
try to move it and hopes it just  
32:01 - doesn't want to work because of the merge cells. 
merge cells are things that people sometimes do  
32:06 - to get title centered, but they make it really 
difficult to work in the data. So you don't want  
32:11 - that. The other thing that you don't want is you 
don't want to have mixed up labels, you don't want  
32:18 - to have things spread across in different tables, 
that might work for an individual project. But  
32:23 - again, if you're planning on sharing it with other 
people, or if there's the possibility, they might  
32:27 - take the data out of Google Sheets, and into some 
statistical application or programming language,  
32:34 - they're going to need something else. Specifically 
tidy data means that each column is the same thing  
32:40 - as a variable variables and columns are identical. 
And that rows and observations are the same  
32:47 - thing. And so we need to get some of this 
cleaned up. And so another thing you can see,  
32:52 - by the way, is with tidy data is that all of 
the data needs to be in this spreadsheet. So  
32:58 - this is an important piece of information 
potentially, but it needs to be in a column  
33:02 - to mark pieces. Also, we've got a comment kind of 
hiding right here. And it tells us something that  
33:07 - maybe this person could be coded as being west 
or an East depending on how we want to do it.  
33:14 - This is not the sort of thing you want to have 
in a comment because if you export the data,  
33:19 - you'll lose all of that information. And so let's 
take a few looks at how to tidy things up to make  
33:25 - them easier to work with and less problematic. 
First one is get rid of all the merge cells,  
33:31 - get rid of those titles we had across the top. 
And then the information that said the first 10  
33:35 - or surveyed in person, make a new column 
and put that in there. So now we have  
33:42 - that information in this spreadsheet, it's not 
included somewhere else, I decided not to make  
33:47 - a change for the comment because I didn't think 
that was necessarily critical. If it were then  
33:52 - you might want to have two locations, starting 
location and ending location for each person.  
33:58 - Now there's a couple of other problems. One is 
that we have gender is coded in a crazy way we  
34:03 - don't even know what the zeros and ones are f&m 
we can guess. And so we need to do a little bit  
34:08 - of data cleaning right now I'm going to come here 
to this tab. And you see I've done two things.  
34:13 - Number one is I took the variable and I changed 
his name from gender to female. Because when you  
34:18 - have a variable that you're going to treat as 
dichotomous, it's really easiest if you use zero  
34:25 - for no a one for Yes, and you name the variable 
by what the one is. In this case I decided to  
34:31 - assign female the one it's arbitrary, you can 
do whichever one you want. But for anybody who  
34:36 - put down that they were female, I put a one for 
anybody who put down they were male, I put a zero.  
34:41 - Similarly, for the method of surveying them, I 
decided that if they got surveyed online, I would  
34:48 - give them a one and if it were anything else, like 
in person, it would be zero. So I've cleaned that  
34:53 - up. But there's one more step that we need to do 
and it has to do with this one right here. We've  
34:58 - got information hear about the location the person 
is. And this is a different level of measurement,  
35:05 - everything else is at the individual level. This 
is now about a larger group that they're in. And  
35:10 - we're repeating a lot of information. If you've 
ever worked with a SQL database or a relational  
35:18 - database, you know that you set up separate 
tables for different levels of measurement,  
35:22 - you want to do the same thing with tidy data. 
So you keep information about the individual.  
35:28 - But then, if you have this information at a 
different level, that's repeated, you put that  
35:33 - into a separate table, it's just a tiny little 
table. And then we only have to indicate whether  
35:38 - a person's location was north, east, south or 
west, we can get the rest of this information  
35:43 - from this table. And when you do those things, 
what you'll end up with ultimately is two  
35:48 - separate sheets, you'll have one sheet that 
contains all the individual level information,  
35:53 - where each column is a variable, each row 
is an observation and all of the relevant  
35:58 - information is put into those variables 
and columns. And you'll have a second sheet  
36:03 - that contains the variables for the other level of 
measurement. Now, again, this is mostly important  
36:10 - if you're going to be exporting your data so it 
can be analyzed in a nother program. If you're  
36:15 - working entirely within Google Sheets, it's 
never going somewhere else. You might be okay,  
36:20 - doing whatever you want. Just be aware that 
the flexibility that you get with spreadsheets  
36:26 - gives you a lot of room for creativity, but it 
can potentially create some headaches. And so  
36:31 - when in doubt, take the tidy data approach, keep 
your data clean and make it easy to work with  
36:38 - easy to analyze and easy to get meaning out of 
your analytical life becomes much simpler and much  
36:45 - faster if you're able to collaborate with 
other people. And fortunately, that's one of  
36:49 - the things that Google Sheets does best. To share 
a document to share a spreadsheet with somebody,  
36:55 - all you need to do is come up to click on 
the blue Share button. And there's a lot of  
37:00 - different ways you can share with people. Now 
the most direct, it's just simply put in their  
37:05 - email address right here. Here's a fake email 
address that I just got data@superego.com. And  
37:12 - you have the option of assigning different 
levels of sharing that that person actually  
37:17 - can change the document, they can edit it, or 
they can simply make comments on it, but they  
37:21 - can't change the actual text. Or they can simply 
view it. And you can say, here is the document.  
37:33 - And it will email that person and let them know 
that they've got the document and then they get  
37:38 - into it and they can start working on it with you. 
You also have the option of sharing with a link.  
37:44 - So for instance, you can say that anybody at 
your organization if you have a Google business  
37:50 - account, or you can click on More here, you can 
share anybody who has a link or public on the web,  
37:56 - which is what I've done on this one. And I've set 
it so that anybody who has the link can view it,  
38:01 - I could set it up so they could comment or 
edit but view is gonna work best in this case,  
38:05 - I hit save. And then as long as 
people have this very long link,  
38:09 - but you click Copy Link, and I'm going to open 
up a new incognito window, click it like this.  
38:19 - And now this is the way that anybody can see it, 
they can see the document, they can't change it,  
38:24 - it's given me a little blurb about updates here. 
Here says View only, that's fine. But you can see  
38:32 - that other people this is my professional account 
with data lab, this is my personal account.  
38:36 - And even though this person can edit it, they 
can download it as a Microsoft Excel file or a  
38:43 - CSV or CSV file, and they can start working 
on it themselves. I'm gonna close this one.  
38:51 - Now one of the nice things about the way that 
sharing works in Google Docs, I'm gonna just  
38:57 - delete this one, I don't really want to share 
with my fake email address, I'm gonna press cancel  
39:03 - and done. But when you're sharing, you can see 
who's sharing right here. That's my personal  
39:07 - account. This is my company account. And you're 
able to see where they are in the document. So for  
39:13 - instance, I'm going to be in this cell right 
here. But I can tell that the other person  
39:18 - is surrounded in pink same as we have up here 
is in this cell. And if I go to that account,  
39:24 - you can see I have the document open. That's 
where I am, you can see that I'm now sharing with  
39:29 - my company account. And it's a good way to see 
who's working on it where they are, and to start  
39:34 - collaborating to get your analysis up and running 
as fast as possible. sharing an individual sheet  
39:41 - within Google Sheets may accomplish your purposes. 
But often you're going to work with people on more  
39:47 - than one thing or there's more than one resource 
you need to share. And in that case, rather than  
39:52 - sharing each of them individually, it's a 
lot easier in Google Drive to share a folder  
39:59 - to do that All you need to do is come to the 
folder that you want to share, and you get it  
40:04 - selected. And you can either come up here to 
get a shareable link, you can click on this  
40:10 - to go share it, or you can, for instance, option, 
click on it right here and do share. And then  
40:18 - you're going to add the person you want to share 
it with, you can put in a specific email address,  
40:22 - and then with that include a message to them. Or 
you can get a link that you can share with people,  
40:27 - you got a lot of different choices here. 
I personally haven't said that anybody  
40:32 - on the web could actually search for this, they 
can searchable on Google and get it or they  
40:36 - have a specific link. Lots of other ways. And you 
also have the option of whether they can view it,  
40:41 - see the contents, or whether they can organize 
add an edit information within each of these. Now,  
40:47 - right now I have it set to just view. And let's 
see, well, if you're looking at these files,  
40:52 - you know how it works. But I'm gonna copy the 
link. And I'm gonna open up an incognito window.  
40:58 - So I'm not logged into this one. And I'll enter 
that link and go to it. And what you have here  
41:05 - are the three different files, I've got a little 
icon file, you can look at that one, it's just a  
41:10 - little data lab icon. I've got an empty document 
that says we're sharing this, this is where it  
41:16 - shared. And I've got the spreadsheet that I'm 
working on right now. And when I open this one,  
41:25 - it gives us this little advertisement lets us 
know that new things are coming, you can see who's  
41:30 - logged into it, that's my personal account. That's 
my company account. And although you can only view  
41:36 - it here, you do have the option of downloading 
the file just as you did when we were sharing  
41:40 - individual files. The nice thing, of course, is 
anything that anybody puts into the folder is  
41:46 - automatically shared with everybody else who has 
access to it. And when you're working on a project  
41:50 - with more than one step in it, say for instance, 
you have a presentation, you have a report,  
41:55 - you have several different files that build 
up to it, sharing a folder is going to be  
41:59 - faster and more efficient and more effective 
way of collaborating within Google Sheets.  
42:05 - If you're going to work with data, you have to 
have some data and you have to have it in Google  
42:10 - Sheets. Now, the fundamental way to do this is to 
enter the data directly into Google Sheets. And  
42:17 - there's a lot of times where that's the preferable 
solution. If you're going to be working with a  
42:22 - statistical program, like SPSS or SAS, it's so 
much easier to put it into a spreadsheet, there's  
42:27 - a lot of advantages to it. One is it's really 
easy to share and have several people working  
42:33 - simultaneously on what you're doing here. Now, I 
want to show you if you're going to be entering  
42:39 - data manually, and say Francis is going to be 
entering it based on paper surveys that you have,  
42:45 - there's a few things you want to do to make your 
life a little easy. First off, you want to have  
42:50 - what's called tidy data. That's a term developed 
by Hadley Wickham, who works with the statistical  
42:56 - programming language R. And it means that a 
variable is the same thing as a column. And that  
43:01 - a case is the same thing as row. And there's just 
no funny business going on in your sheet. So let's  
43:06 - start with this one. If you're entering paper, the 
first thing you need to do is have an ID number  
43:11 - so that you can find that piece of paper in case 
something gets entered wrong. Now, you may need to  
43:17 - get out a pen and write these numbers on a piece 
of paper. And then maybe you start putting in the  
43:22 - questions. Now I want to show you something kind 
of neat that Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel are  
43:28 - able to do and what that is, is propagating. 
So if you take a pattern as easy to follow.  
43:36 - So for instance, I like to type q 01, where q is 
for question, and then do q 02. For Question two  
43:44 - minute, I'm not doing q1 q2, cuz it's gonna think 
that means quarter, one, quarter, two in the year.  
43:50 - But if I do the leading zeros, especially 
if there's more than nine questions, this is  
43:54 - important, I can select those first two, and then 
I can just drag them over. And it will propagate  
44:01 - and fill in with the same pattern. You can do that 
for however many you have. And then what I'm going  
44:08 - to do is I'm going to take this top column, I'm 
going to put it in bold, and maybe I will even  
44:16 - center the columns you don't have to and there's 
a there is a precedent for text columns being  
44:22 - justified to the left and numbers 
being justified to the right, you know,  
44:26 - it's up to you. Sometimes I just like to do this 
so that the labels are directly above the numbers,  
44:31 - it's a little easier to see what's going 
on. And then I'm going to freeze the top row  
44:36 - by simply dragging this bar down. And now when 
you scroll up and down, that top row stays put.  
44:42 - If you're going to be entering data from pieces 
of paper, like I said you need ID numbers and  
44:47 - so you go like this 123 and it can propagate that 
same pattern. So I'll drag it down a little bit.  
44:56 - And now we've got the numbers as long as 
those match up with what's on your paper,  
45:00 - you're good to go. If several people are entering 
the data, then you might want to be able to  
45:05 - separate who has what. And the first person might 
start with 101. And then one or two. So the one,  
45:12 - the first 100 indicates the person, the second 
number indicates which one they're working on.  
45:19 - And then the next person can start with 201, 
and 202. It's okay that there are gaps that you  
45:25 - go straight from 107 to 201, you just can't have 
repeats, that's the important thing. And this way,  
45:31 - people can be working separately on their own 
computers, and they can be entering the data  
45:35 - simultaneously in the same sheet. And it 
gets in there, it's wonderful. And so the  
45:41 - very simple method for entering this is to type 
in a number, let's say you've got a rating scale,  
45:47 - and people are putting in a number. And then I 
hit tab, go to the next one, or a right arrow, and  
45:52 - nine, and I can go through and enter like this. 
I'm just hitting tab at each point, when I get  
45:59 - to the end, I hit return. And it takes me back 
to where I started on the first line. And I can  
46:06 - go on like this, I can type in the data however I 
want. If you have missing data, if a person didn't  
46:11 - answer a question is it best to simply leave it 
blank. And then if they typed in something you  
46:16 - can put in eight, although I would hope that they 
didn't type in something on what's supposed to be  
46:22 - a numerical variable. But the idea here is you can 
put in whatever you want, and you enter the data  
46:27 - all the way through. And now you have entered 
your data manually. And you're prepared to do  
46:32 - subsequent analyses. Although it's possible for 
you to enter all your data in manually in Google  
46:38 - sheets or another spreadsheet. And again, there 
may be situations where you need to do that,  
46:43 - life is so much easier if you can simply import 
the data and dump it in there and get going. Now,  
46:48 - what I want to show you is slightly different 
from importing a file into Google Drive the  
46:53 - place that stores files. So for instance, you can 
take an Excel file, drag it into Google Drive,  
46:59 - and you can store it in either the native Excel 
format or converted to a Google Sheets document, I  
47:05 - actually want to show you how to import something 
straight into a sheet in an existing Google Sheet.  
47:11 - And to do this, we're simply going to go up 
to File and then come down here to import.  
47:18 - And when you do that, it's going to ask you 
to import something I'm going to go to upload  
47:25 - and select a file from my computer that 
actually, let me show you what I have here.  
47:31 - I have three files here that are identical except 
for their format. They're all called import. And  
47:36 - they're just data files that have an ID number, a 
date, or response ID five rating scale questions  
47:46 - in a zip code, it's this is made up data. This is 
in Excel as an XLS x spreadsheet. This over here  
47:53 - is the same data in a CSV or comma separated value 
spreadsheet. And this one in the middle here is a  
48:00 - text document, but they're still separated 
by tabs. So it's identical information in  
48:05 - all of them. So what I'm going to do is 
I'm going to come back to Google Sheets.  
48:11 - And I'm going to select one of these files. I'm 
just going to take the import dot CSV, I'm going  
48:18 - to hit open. And then it's going to bring up a 
little dialog box and ask me some questions about  
48:23 - what I want to do. Do I want to create a totally 
new spreadsheet? No, I don't even want to insert a  
48:28 - new sheet, I want to replace the current sheet. So 
it's the sheet that I already have the information  
48:34 - on, put it there. And if I want to tell it what 
the separator is a tab, comma, or whatever,  
48:40 - but it can detect it automatically. And 
I'm using comma separated values. So it's  
48:45 - it's easy to deal with, and then convert text 
and numbers and dates. Yes. And I hit import  
48:52 - takes just a second. And here it is, it's in my 
new sheet. And so I've got my data, all the rows  
48:59 - and the columns are intact. If I want to make my 
life a little easier. I'll freeze the top row.  
49:07 - And maybe I will come here, maybe 
I'll select the whole thing.  
49:13 - And make it all flush, right. Except for 
these two, which I'll put then back to  
49:18 - flush left. And my data sets ready to go. And now 
I can start analyzing. So importing directly into  
49:26 - an existing Google Sheet very quick and easy 
way to get up and running with Google Sheets.  
49:32 - I have an untested theory that the single most 
common container for data sets in the entire world  
49:38 - is spreadsheets. And of those I think the 
majority are probably going to be Microsoft Excel  
49:44 - spreadsheets. So for instance, if somebody sends 
you a spreadsheet or if you download a spreadsheet  
49:48 - from online, it might be an Excel format. And even 
though it's really easy to import Excel directly  
49:54 - into Google Drive or into Google Sheets, I do 
want to show you you also can just resort to  
49:59 - plain ol cop Paste. So I've got a spreadsheet 
here, that's import, and it's the same data  
50:05 - I've been using for some other examples. I'm 
going to select the entire set by doing shift  
50:10 - and then command or control with space, I get the 
rectangle, I'm going to hit copy, and then just  
50:16 - go back to excel sheets and hit paste, I'm going 
to do Ctrl or Command V in this case, and there's  
50:23 - my data I'm ready to go. On the other hand, it 
may be that you also are going to be using data  
50:29 - from web pages on tables. I do this occasionally. 
And so for instance, if we go to this next tab,  
50:37 - I have a link here to a page in Wikipedia on Nobel 
laureates that has a table in it. So let's open  
50:45 - this page. And it talks about who's won the Nobel 
Prize, which is a wonderful thing to do. And here  
50:52 - we have a table with a list of everybody who has 
ever won a Nobel prize from 1901, down through  
51:02 - 2017. There we go. Now what I'm going 
to do is I'm going to copy this, I  
51:12 - find it works best if I start at the bottom 
right, and I just click and I drag up.  
51:19 - And I'm gonna go up to 1901, 
there's have to not go past it,  
51:28 - almost there. And I'm going to copy the headings 
too. So now I let go, I've got that all selected,  
51:36 - I do Command or Ctrl C to copy it. Then 
I'm going to go back to my spreadsheet.  
51:44 - I'm going to come to this cell right here. And all 
I do is I hit Command or Control V to paste it in.  
51:50 - Now this is going to do something slightly weird. 
And that is, these are all links. So I've got a  
51:55 - million links in this table. And truthfully, that 
may cause problems as I'm trying to deal with the  
52:00 - data. So I'm actually going to ask Google Sheets 
to not paste it as links. But to paste as plain  
52:06 - text, I do that by coming to this little clipboard 
that pops up when you first pay something.  
52:12 - And I say give me the values only. And now 
you see it just turns into unformatted text.  
52:18 - And that's a great way to go. I can then 
if I want to I can delete this first row.  
52:27 - I can then lock that first 
row, I can put it in bold.  
52:34 - I can highlight the columns and then just 
double click right here to resize them.  
52:40 - And now I've got a data set that 
I can work with. This is great.  
52:43 - I do want to show you one tiny more little trick 
about copying and pasting. In Excel, I'm going to  
52:49 - go to this sheet called paste transpose. And I'm 
just going to type in a little bit of data here.  
52:54 - Now, I showed you in another video how Google 
Sheets is able to fill in a pattern. And if you do  
53:02 - 123, it just keeps continuing. If you do q 01 or 
q 02. It can also do this with things like days of  
53:10 - the week. So I've got Sunday, Monday here. And I'm 
just gonna highlight those two. And I'll drag it  
53:16 - down a little bit. And look we have now have the 
whole week. Now what I want to show you, if you  
53:22 - want to switch it from being arranged vertically 
in a column to being the column headers,  
53:28 - what you want to do is a special kind of paste 
called A transpose or transposition. So I'm going  
53:33 - to copy this by hitting Ctrl or Command C, that'll 
just come over here. And I'm going to do a Ctrl,  
53:39 - click, it's actually a two finger, click on 
my trackpad, and go to paste special. And  
53:45 - we've got a few options here. The one I want to 
show is this one right here, paste transpose,  
53:52 - and it flips it around from the rows to the 
columns. And if you're trying to set up your data  
53:56 - for analysis, this can save you a lot of stress 
about trying to rearrange things manually. So  
54:03 - that's just one final tip on getting data by copy 
and paste into Google Sheets. When you're working  
54:10 - with data, one of the truisms is that about 80% of 
the time is spent simply getting the data ready.  
54:17 - And when you're working in Google Sheets, you got 
a few things that can help you get the data ready,  
54:22 - especially in terms of keeping notes for yourself 
and communicating with others. In this video,  
54:27 - I want to show you how to make notes which are a 
little different from comments which I'm going to  
54:31 - show you another time. A note is something 
that you put in a cell that is an addition  
54:37 - to that cell. So for instance, let's try this. 
In this page. I've got three different sets of  
54:43 - data. I've got days of the week, I've got months 
of the year and I've got a series of odd numbers.  
54:48 - There are a couple of mistakes in this one. So 
for instance, we have June appears twice here.  
54:54 - One possibility is to make a note here, I can 
either right click on That's a two finger click.  
55:03 - And I can insert a note. Or I can 
come up to the menu here and do insert  
55:09 - note. And what I'm going to 
say is, June, appears twice.  
55:18 - When I click away from that, you can 
see that we've got this little box here,  
55:23 - this little corner. And if I hover over the cell, 
then the note appears. Now the only trick is,  
55:29 - somebody has to actually be on the sheet to know 
that that's there, I'll go to my other account  
55:34 - where I'm sharing this. And you can see that 
that note now appears, it doesn't say who did it,  
55:40 - it's just a note that's in the cell. Now, some 
people unfortunately, try to put actual data  
55:46 - there stuff that you need to know to interpret 
it, please don't ever do that. This is something  
55:50 - that can be there temporarily in terms of drawing 
attention to something, even though it's not very  
55:54 - effective at drawing, but adding a little more 
context to what you have in the cell. Now, a more  
56:02 - effective way is to actually make a comment, which 
is what I want to show you in the next video.  
56:08 - When you're collaborating with others on your 
data, you want to be able to communicate back  
56:11 - and forth. And sometimes the best way is to put 
comments on specific cells within a spreadsheet.  
56:17 - Now, you can do notes, which I showed you 
previously. But those are just kind of passive,  
56:21 - and they're there, they don't draw attention 
to themselves and not attributed to anybody.  
56:25 - And they're really not as helpful as an actual 
comment. Let me show you how this is going to  
56:31 - work, I'm going to highlight two errors in this 
spreadsheet. One is I have the month in June  
56:36 - twice. Now to insert a comment, I can do a few 
different things, I can come up here to insert.  
56:42 - Or I can use the keyboard shortcut, which 
can be a little different on Macintosh,  
56:46 - which is what I'm using and Windows computers. 
Or you can also right click on it or option,  
56:53 - click on it and come down to insert comment. 
That's what I'm going to do right now.  
56:57 - And then you see that it brings up who's making 
the comment and this is my personal account. And  
57:02 - then it's going to say, why is this repeated. 
And then I can do Command or Control Enter or  
57:12 - to hit the comment. And so that's that rephrase. 
And so that's now there. Now let's go to the other  
57:17 - account to see what it looks like in the 
discussion. And you're at this highlights  
57:22 - that there's a comment there. So it's drawing 
attention to itself in the way that a note didn't.  
57:28 - And it lets me know who's asking the question. 
And I can then click on this. And say, because  
57:38 - June was so good, we wanted it twice. And I can 
click on reply. And now we're both in this thread.  
57:52 - And then I can come down here Oh look, it 
brings up my whole google plus profile.  
57:57 - And if you want to bring in somebody else, you 
could click on this, you could say for instance,  
58:03 - let's put data at sample Comm. I don't 
think that's a real email address.  
58:10 - What do you think? And this is a way of bringing 
in additional people to the conversation inviting  
58:17 - them and highlight in the comment for them, 
I'm actually going to send this because that's  
58:22 - not a real email address, I'm gonna hit Cancel to 
discard the comment. But the comment is there and  
58:28 - you can ask for information, you can propose 
a resolution. And when you finally come around  
58:33 - to it, you can go like this, you can say, 
well, let's fix it. Let's do July. And then  
58:39 - we've now resolved it. So we can hit resolve. And 
it hides the discussion it archives it. And so  
58:46 - that is now done, I can go to the 
other account to see what's happened.  
58:50 - And you can see that the comment 
notification is gone, the comment is gone.  
58:55 - And it's fixed. And so this is a really good 
way of drawing attention to things that need  
59:00 - repairing, and then making the action, I'll just 
highlight that we have one other right here.  
59:08 - And I'll insert another comment. This 
should not be here. It's not odd.  
59:20 - Anyhow, that's something you can do for future 
reference as a way of communicating with others.  
59:26 - And it makes organizing the data and getting 
ready for your analysis a lot easier within  
59:30 - Google Sheets. When you're collaborating with 
other people. Sometimes it's sufficient to  
59:35 - put notes into the document or to have the 
common feature which invites a discussion,  
59:40 - but that's asynchronous, it's not in real 
time. On the other hand, there are different  
59:45 - times when having a real time conversation is 
going to get you a lot further a lot faster in  
59:52 - your work. Fortunately, Google Sheets makes that 
kind of conversation really easy with a built in  
59:59 - chat. functionality. To do that, you have to have 
at least two people working on the same document,  
60:05 - I can come over here and I can see that I've 
got it open in my other account. And then I  
60:09 - click on this icon, which says show chat. And 
then I simply come down to the chat window,  
60:17 - type Hello. And then lets me know I've sent them 
a message. Now let me go to the other account.  
60:23 - And it's telling me that there's a 
message here. Now, if I click on this,  
60:27 - it just kind of goes away. But if I come up 
here, where I've got my little notification  
60:31 - dot, I open up the chat, 
and there it is. Here I am.  
60:39 - What's up. And now I've got this conversation 
going back and forth. And this allows people  
60:45 - to work together in a way to try to solve the 
issues, it works really well when people are  
60:51 - really far apart. And maybe for instance, a live 
telephone conversation is not the best idea.  
60:59 - This chat history stays there, as long as anybody 
has the document open. So for instance, let me go  
61:08 - to my other account. And I will close the document 
here. And then once you get over here is an  
61:15 - indication that Barton Paulson, that's my other 
account has left. If I close the document here,  
61:23 - and then I open it right back 
up. I give it a moment to load.  
61:33 - And there's actually nothing there because the 
other person is not even in there anymore. So the  
61:37 - chat history disappears once everybody closes the 
document. But while you're there, it's a great way  
61:43 - to have this real time conversation about what's 
happening in the document, what tasks needs to be  
61:48 - done, how to interpret and how to apply your 
insights, certain skills seems so basic that  
61:55 - they don't really seem worth discussing. But it 
turns out that knowing some of the special tricks  
62:00 - can make your life a lot easier. This applies 
to Google Sheets as it applies to so many other  
62:05 - things. And what I want to show you in terms of 
basic skills is simply how to select data and move  
62:11 - it around. Now, obviously, if you want to select 
just one cell, you get your cursor and you click  
62:17 - on that cell, and you can move it around by doing 
the arrows here and driving it around with the  
62:22 - arrows that's left in one cell. That's easy. If 
you want to select a column, just come and click  
62:28 - on the letter above that column. And you've got 
the entire thing. If you want select more than  
62:33 - one column, click and drag across. Now you've 
got columns. And the same thing works for rows,  
62:38 - just click on the row number. Can you select 
the entire row, you can select several rows as  
62:44 - well by clicking and dragging. So that's easy. 
If you want to select the entire spreadsheet,  
62:50 - come up here and click on this area that's 
to the top left. And that selects everything  
62:57 - every single cell in the entire spreadsheet. Let's 
come back up to here. Let's say I want to select  
63:02 - just this first row. Now actually, to make this 
easier, I'm going to maximize my screen so you  
63:08 - can see the entire data set, I'm first going to 
go fullscreen on my Mac and then I'm going to hide  
63:15 - these controls right here. And so now you can see, 
I've got a data set with an empty column right  
63:21 - here and I've got an empty row right here, that's 
going to affect how some of this stuff works.  
63:26 - Now, let me come up to here, I'll just stick 
the cursor right here. If I want to select an  
63:31 - entire column, I can do it with the keyboard by 
doing Ctrl and space. And you see what it does  
63:38 - is it selects vertically, until it thinks 
it has reached the end of the data.  
63:44 - And it thinks it's reached the end because 
I've got this big empty row right here,  
63:48 - so it ignores it. On the other hand, if that 
row were not empty, let's say I put an X there.  
63:56 - And I were to give this a title up here, I'll 
call that x also. Now it's going to unite the  
64:02 - whole data set, I'm going to come back over to 
here, I'll hit control and space, and nicea slugs  
64:08 - down to the bottom because now it sees this 
all in one unified whole, even though there  
64:12 - are gaps in it. So Ctrl Space selects the entire 
current column. I'll do Ctrl Space right here.  
64:19 - And if I want to expand my selection, I can 
do shift and then use an arrow, right arrow or  
64:26 - left arrow to get more of what I want. There's 
a similar command for selecting rows. So let  
64:32 - me just hit escape. I'll actually I'll just 
click right here. And I'll do shift space.  
64:39 - And what this does is it selects the entire row 
in the data rectangle. If I want to expand that,  
64:46 - I can use the down arrow or I can use the up 
arrow. And that is a way of selecting data,  
64:52 - sometimes a little more precisely 
than dragging through with a cursor.  
64:56 - One other thing that you want to know is about 
moving data. So say for instance, I want to move  
65:04 - this score. So it's on the other side of 
category, what I do is you see how I selected  
65:10 - it. Now when I come up here, I have a hand, if I 
just click and drag over, I switched him around,  
65:17 - I'll put it back by undoing that move. That's 
really easy. I do this same thing right here.  
65:25 - I'll expand that, I can click and just drag 
down my data and move it to a new position.  
65:35 - And this can be an important way of fixing the way 
that you've entered things, you can sort things  
65:40 - manually with an ID number. But in terms of 
rearranging variables, the click and drag is by  
65:45 - far the easiest way to go. And so the ability 
to click on individual cells and then expand  
65:52 - my doing shift and the arrows, or to select 
rows and columns within the data rectangle,  
66:00 - by doing Ctrl. N space, or shift and space are 
great ways to grab the data you need and perform  
66:08 - the functions you want. It's a small thing, and 
again, doesn't always seem worth mentioning. But  
66:13 - it can make your life much quicker and less 
error prone when working in Google Sheets.  
66:19 - One of the most important things you can do 
for making sense of your data is to first get  
66:24 - it sorted, put it in order, because a spreadsheet 
allows you to do something called Data browsing.  
66:30 - And is to actually look at the data that's in 
front of you, again, is sounds like a fundamental  
66:36 - thing, but it makes a really big difference. 
Fortunately, this is really easy to do in Google  
66:41 - Sheets. And you need to be aware this works a 
little differently than it does in Microsoft  
66:45 - Excel. Because when there are gaps in Excel, 
sometimes things don't sort the way you expected,  
66:51 - you can actually terminally mess up the data. But 
in Google Sheets, it's really easy. Now what I  
66:58 - have is a small data set here with an ID number. 
And I have a random number, they got descending  
67:04 - letters and categories and so on. Here's all you 
have to do to sort come here to the top in this  
67:12 - little sea, watch how this little arrow shows 
up, you click on that. And then you can sort  
67:18 - a to z which means ascending or Z to A which is 
descending, you can actually randomize it, too.  
67:25 - So now I've sorted it descending based on this 
random number. If you want to sort it by more than  
67:31 - one category, what you need to do is to sort it by 
the last one until the big one. So for instance,  
67:40 - I might want to have this category over here, I 
can show you what it looks like when it's sorted.  
67:45 - I've got some fours and some ones. By the way, 
what it's doing is it's sorting alphabetically,  
67:50 - not in terms of meaning. But let's say I wanted to 
have these numbers sorted within these categories,  
67:58 - the scores. So what I have to do is 
I have to start with the last one.  
68:02 - So I'm going to come to score. And I'm going 
to sort this sheet in ascending values.  
68:07 - And then I come next to category. And I sort 
it by ascending values. And now within four,  
68:13 - I've got my 123 and three. And so this way, I 
can have a first sort of second sort. But again,  
68:20 - you have to do it kind of in a backwards 
method. But anyhow, it's a very quick and  
68:25 - easy way to get things under control. Also, one 
of the reasons I mentioned earlier as as really  
68:31 - important to have an ID row a column that 
gives an ID number is because it makes it  
68:36 - possible to get back your original order, 
I'm just going to sort this ascending.  
68:41 - And then right back to where I was to begin with. 
Sometimes you only need to deal with some of your  
68:47 - data, you don't need to see everybody but you 
need to see cases that meet specific criteria.  
68:53 - Google Sheets allows you to do this very easily 
with filtering. What you do is when you have  
68:58 - your data in front of you is you come over and you 
click on this icon over here, which is the filter.  
69:03 - And when you click that, it selects the data 
table, it was the column headers and the row  
69:09 - headers in green. And you get these little 
filter icons. Now, you can do a couple of  
69:15 - different things with these. You can select text, 
you can select scores, you can create formulas,  
69:21 - I'll show you a two step selection for the 
filter. So we can find cases that meet particular  
69:27 - criteria. So for instance, let me come over 
here to category let's say, I only want to see  
69:36 - category one and three, I can deselect these 
other two or you can do it the other way you  
69:41 - can clear them all and then select just 
the ones that you want Either one works.  
69:45 - So one and three and I click that and you see 
it, the other ones are filtered out now and  
69:51 - then if I want to do a nother layer on top of 
that, for instance, I can come here to score  
69:57 - and I can say I only want to see Cases whose 
score is above a certain value. Now I could  
70:03 - select them manually because you only have a few 
choices here. But I can also come up to filter by  
70:08 - condition. And I've got a lot of different choices 
here with text and date. And values, I'm gonna say  
70:15 - greater than not greater than or equal to, but 
greater than. And I'm going to put in a three.  
70:21 - And when I click that, the other 
cases are filtered out. And so now,  
70:25 - whereas I originally had 19 lines of data, 
I'm now down to a much smaller number. Now,  
70:32 - it's kind of hard to tell because it's hiding the 
row numbers of the cases that were filtered out.  
70:39 - But now I only have the six cases that meet my two 
criteria of being in either category one or three,  
70:46 - and having a score greater than three. And so 
this allows me to find particular cases, say,  
70:51 - for instance, people who have made over a certain 
number of purchases or open requests, or people  
70:57 - who've been involved an unusually high amount with 
your organization. This allows you to find those  
71:02 - particular cases, and give them the attention that 
they deserve. When you're trying to sort through  
71:07 - your data and filter out cases that needs special 
attention, you have the option of either doing  
71:12 - what I call ad hoc filters, which are the ones 
you get when you simply click on the filter icon.  
71:18 - And it brings up a menu like this. But you also 
have the option of doing what are called filter  
71:24 - views, which stay with the data and you can have 
multiple filter views. Let me show you how these  
71:29 - are a little different. I'm going to click on 
new filter view, you have to click on the arrow  
71:34 - to get those. And then you see the window looks 
a little different. We got this black bar here,  
71:38 - and the column headers and row headers are in 
black. But let's do a filter view. Now what I'm  
71:46 - going to do here is let's say let's get the 
first 10 cases, I'm going to come over here,  
71:51 - click on this filter for ID. And then I'm 
going to say filter by condition where the  
72:00 - value is less than or equal to 10. 
Okay, when I get that I hit OK.  
72:08 - And there we have it and see by the way 
that the rows Now jump from 11 to 20.  
72:12 - But what's interesting is I can save this filter, 
I come up here to where it says name says filter  
72:17 - one, I just highlight that, and I replace 
that with let's call it the first 10 cases.  
72:28 - And so now, that's a saved filter. And if I come 
over to here, and click on this little side arrow,  
72:35 - you can see it saved right there. Now let's 
go to none. So it undoes that one. And let's  
72:41 - create another filter view, I'm going to 
come and click on this right arrow again,  
72:45 - say new filter view. And let's replicate a filter 
I did with the other example on regular filtering,  
72:52 - let's come to category and select just 
the one and three. So there's that one,  
73:00 - and then let's select scores that are 
greater than three. So greater than three.  
73:12 - Alright, and now I've got those cases. And 
I can come over here and name that one as  
73:19 - category one and three, score greater than 
three. And so that is saved as a filter to.  
73:30 - So when I come back here, I have both of those 
available to me, and the ability to turn it all  
73:35 - off. So if I want to go see just the first 
10 cases, I click like this, I get those.  
73:40 - If I want my compound selection, I click like 
this. And it's different. And if I want to have  
73:45 - the entire data set, I simply click none. And 
all of these are useful. I use it all the time  
73:50 - when I have to find cases that have not yet been 
resolved, and allows me to see the open cases.  
73:56 - And I just select down to those unable to focus 
on them exclusively. So it's a wonderful way to  
74:02 - save the view into your data and also to be 
able to share it with others. And so that,  
74:06 - again, allows you to soar through your data focus 
on the particular cases that are most important  
74:11 - and get your analysis done. You may get to a point 
in your analyses where you don't want to work  
74:16 - with just specific collaborators, but you actually 
want to get out to everybody. Google Sheets allows  
74:23 - you to publish your both your spreadsheet and 
your results to the entire Worldwide Web. This is  
74:30 - different from sharing via link where people can 
actually log in and potentially make changes to  
74:35 - your folder. This is actually where you can post 
it as a web page or as a downloadable Excel file  
74:40 - or a PDF. And well it makes the most sense to do 
this with individual graphics, which you can embed  
74:47 - in a web page. I want to show you how this works 
in general. What you need to do is come up to  
74:52 - File and then come down to publish to the web. 
And when you click on that you get a few different  
74:58 - choices. You can publish the entire document, 
or you can publish one of the tabs out of it.  
75:05 - I'll do the entire document for right now. But 
you may have more specific needs. And also,  
75:10 - you can publish it as a web page, in which case, 
it'll show up as an HTML web page. Or you can  
75:16 - do any of these other formats, in which case, 
it will simply initiate an automatic download  
75:21 - of the file. So you don't see anything there. 
Just go straight to your download folder.  
75:27 - Let me show you what this looks like. 
I'm going to publish the entire thing,  
75:30 - I'm going to hit Publish. It says Do I want 
to publish it? Yes, because you don't want to  
75:36 - do this stuff by accident. And now I've got this 
big long web address, I'm going to copy that and  
75:43 - go to a private browser, I'm going to open it 
up. And now you can see now it's not the most  
75:52 - attractive or well formatted. But that's because 
it's a web page and not the actual spreadsheet.  
75:57 - Because I published the entire spreadsheet, I have 
all of these different tabs that are available as  
76:04 - hyperlink selections. And so this is one way 
of sharing things. Now, again, this works  
76:09 - better if it's graphics that you're sharing, 
especially if they're interactive graphics.  
76:13 - I don't have an example of those later. But 
this is one way to get things out and about.  
76:18 - The other option, by the way, aside from linking 
is to embed the information into a website,  
76:23 - like a WordPress site, or Squarespace or your own 
website. And then you can include the data there.  
76:29 - So that is already hosted in house for people, 
they don't have to go to the link directly,  
76:34 - but it's right there in front of them. And any 
of those methods will allow you to get your data  
76:39 - out and your message out to as wide an audience 
as possible. The last thing I want to say about  
76:47 - sharing files and sharing your work is of course 
that sometimes things go wrong. Sometimes you  
76:52 - put stuff in you accidentally delete something, 
or formulas get mixed up at some way long. And  
76:58 - there are problems. And you may want to be able 
to backup the work that you did. Fortunately,  
77:03 - this is really, really simple in Google Sheets, 
because it has a built in version history. To get  
77:10 - to this, all you need to do is come to file, 
and down to version history. Now one of the  
77:16 - interesting things is that you have an option of 
naming the current version, you can say draft one,  
77:21 - draft two or clients review or whatever. But 
let's come here and see the version history.  
77:28 - When I click on that, it's going to show me 
all the different changes that have been made.  
77:33 - Now these ones I mean, if you click open on 
them, you're going to see a lot more things.  
77:38 - And two things, you have the option saying show 
me only the named version. So I have draft one  
77:43 - and the final version, which are my named ones. 
And then you also have the option saying show  
77:49 - the changes. So if I unclick that, it simply shows 
you the plain document, if you click Show changes,  
77:54 - it lets you know that all of this got added 
and it got added by this person in this color,  
78:01 - the teal Barton pulse and founder RF we 
back up a little more, you can see draft  
78:06 - one. And you can see for instance, that there was 
information that got added. I think here in notes,  
78:15 - you see the number of tabs changes, 
and that this is all new for this one.  
78:19 - And so this is an option to hit restore this 
version, go back in time to the one you had,  
78:26 - before things got out of hand, you can recover 
from any mistake in Google Sheets, you can also  
78:33 - create these different versions that allow you to 
have a sort of version control. So you don't have  
78:37 - to be a fancy person using GitHub, or subversion 
or something like that. You can use the built in  
78:43 - version history in Google Sheets to keep track 
of your work to recover from errors and see who's  
78:49 - contributed what, it's a great way of getting 
accountability and getting recoverability.  
78:56 - The first graph I want to show you isn't 
even technically, Google Sheets graph,  
79:01 - it's a hack. It uses a function called repeat to 
make a bar chart, and it puts it in a cell which  
79:08 - actually is really convenient and makes a 
lot of other things possible. Let me show  
79:12 - you how this works. What I have here is a made 
up data of the number of social media followers,  
79:18 - a person might have on several different 
platforms, Facebook, Twitter, and so on.  
79:23 - And I've counted the number of people. Now you can 
also do this if you have means averages, and you  
79:29 - put the number in there. But let's just see how we 
do this. I want to make a column called chart. And  
79:34 - then I'm going to type in equals because I'm using 
a function and our E p t, which stands for repeat.  
79:42 - Now, when you use the repeat function, the first 
thing it wants to know is what is it going to  
79:46 - repeat what's it going to put in many times and 
you have to put it in quotes. I'm going to do  
79:50 - the quote and then the vertical pipe that's 
on the US keyboard is above the return key.  
79:57 - And then you tell it how many times you want 
it. And that's where I refer over to this cell.  
80:04 - And you can see it's giving you a preview 
of it right there, I'm going to close the  
80:08 - formula with the closing parenthesis, hit return. 
And now I've got 50 pipes, all adjust that,  
80:17 - that show an indication of how many people you 
have following you on Facebook. What's neat about  
80:22 - this is because it's a formula, I can just drag 
this down like this. And now I've got a for each  
80:28 - one of my cells. And so it's really easy to see 
that we got about twice as many people here as  
80:33 - we have here. And that's about twice as many as 
we have here. It's also really flexible. If you  
80:39 - want to draw attention to one particular category, 
say for instance, you're interested in Instagram,  
80:45 - you can just highlight that row. And 
for instance, you can change its color.  
80:52 - And now you've got a bar that matches the 
color you've put things in. So this is a way  
80:56 - to make it easy to find what you're looking 
for and focus, especially if you have a lot of  
81:00 - different categories you're looking at. Plus, this 
is a flexible procedure. Let me just copy this and  
81:05 - paste it down here. Now what we're getting 
is five more pipes, but you can put anything  
81:10 - other than pipes. So for instance, I got a little 
emoji here, smiley face with eyes, I'm going to  
81:16 - copy that, I'm going to come back over to this. 
And instead of the pipe, I'm going to do Smiley's.  
81:23 - And so now you got a graphic, you can use any 
emoji you want positive, negative, funny ones. But  
81:29 - it lets you get a very quick visualization. And 
it's a great way to start looking at your data.  
81:35 - The single most useful chart that you can make is 
a bar chart for showing a quantity by category,  
81:41 - either the number of people in a group, or an 
average for that group. And this is really easy  
81:47 - to do in Google Sheets. Here I have a table. This 
shows the frequencies for a number of social media  
81:53 - followers in each platform. And all I have to do 
is select one of these cells, I got it up here  
81:58 - in the top, and I come over to Insert Chart. And 
Google Sheets is smart enough to know that I want  
82:06 - a bar chart by default. Now you can see here, if 
I click on suggested it gives me a few choices.  
82:12 - But this is the bar chart really quick and easy. 
There's a few things I would want to do to modify  
82:17 - this first, I'm actually going to move it over a 
little bit. So it's not overlapping with my data.  
82:22 - Instead of saying count versus social media 
followers, I'm going to change the title.  
82:26 - I just clicked on that. And I'm going to put by 
platform. I'm going to get rid of this legend here  
82:34 - because it doesn't tell me anything useful. So I 
click on that, double click, and then I put none.  
82:43 - I'm going to change this word over here from count  
82:46 - to followers. And then I don't think I need 
this here on the bottom. So I'm just going to  
82:56 - select that and then delete it. And then finally, 
I think I'm going to change the color of the bars,  
83:03 - I'm going to double click on the bars, pick a 
different color. I personally like this red.  
83:11 - And so there's an excellent bar chart. Now 
I will mention one funny thing. Technically,  
83:16 - this isn't a bar chart, it's a column chart, 
because it's vertical. A bar chart goes sideways.  
83:22 - And so let's take a quick look at how we can make 
it a bar chart. I'm going to copy this chart,  
83:31 - and then paste it. And then 
I'll drag this down a little.  
83:36 - So I can put it underneath. I'll scroll up now.  
83:42 - And all I need to do is double click on this 
chart, and then come over and tell it I no longer  
83:48 - want a column chart, I want a bar chart. Now I'm 
gonna have to clean things up, it went back to the  
83:55 - default title. So I'm going to change it again to 
BI platform. And I'm going to delete this again.  
84:12 - And I need to clean this up again. But the reason 
this is a good chart, the sideways bar chart is  
84:22 - because if you have long labels now the words 
Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are not long.  
84:28 - But if they were longer than this makes it easier 
to read them because you don't have to turn your  
84:32 - head sideways or something and it puts it 
in the same orientation as the bar itself,  
84:37 - so it's easier to follow through with it in a 
logical manner. Anyhow, this is the simplest  
84:43 - chart you can make a bar chart a column chart 
and truthfully 90% of the time it's going to  
84:48 - give you all the information you need to 
make the conclusions based on your data.  
84:54 - A recent development in Google Sheets is a way 
that makes it even easier to create bar charts.  
85:00 - Now in another video, I showed you how to create 
bar charts using a table where you summarize  
85:04 - the number of cases you have in each category. 
But Google Sheets is also able to do this with  
85:09 - raw data. So here, we just have a list of a whole 
bunch of followers. We have Pinterest, Facebook,  
85:13 - Facebook, so on and so forth, we can scroll down, 
you can see they're all kind of jumbled in there.  
85:18 - But we don't even have to count them. All I 
need to do is come over to this insert, chart,  
85:24 - click on that. And it creates a bar chart, 
it counts it all by itself. Now, I'm going to  
85:30 - still do a couple of things here to clean this 
one up. I'm going to change the title here.  
85:39 - So that it says social media followers 
by platform, I'm going to get rid of this  
85:46 - legend because it's not helpful 
and takes up a lot of space.  
85:50 - I need to change this over here to say just 
say followers on the vertical axis. And on the  
85:57 - horizontal axis, I don't need that title at all. 
So I'm going to just delete that. And there you  
86:03 - have it, you got a bar chart quick and easy. Now 
the only major qualification on this one is that  
86:10 - you see the bars are out of order. What they are 
is they're in the order that each category first  
86:15 - appears in the data. So you can see the very first 
one is Pinterest. The second one is Facebook,  
86:20 - then we scroll down a little bit, we get 
Twitter. And you can't modify that. And so that's  
86:27 - one small problem. But it still makes 
it really easy to see that most of the  
86:31 - followers are from Facebook, the least or from 
medium. And it lets you start getting insights  
86:36 - in your data without even having to do the 
Data Prep of putting it in the table first.  
86:41 - If you want to look at the relationship between 
two different variables, or two different outcomes  
86:46 - and how they affect your results, a grouped 
bar chart can be a really good way to do this.  
86:52 - So here I have the same social media followers 
data I have had before. And now I've labeled the  
86:58 - data we've had previously as subscribers, 
and I've added a new column for visitors,  
87:03 - you might be able to tell these apart and get 
separate reports in your analytic software.  
87:08 - But let's see how we can show each of these. And 
what's interesting is this is where Google Sheets  
87:13 - gives us a few important alternatives. I'm just 
going to select this first cell here, come over to  
87:20 - Insert Chart. And once again, it's nice 
that Google Sheets is smart enough to  
87:24 - select the entire table of data and it gives it 
a good title. And what we have here is a side  
87:30 - by side chart. Now I'm going to make just a few 
changes here. I'm going to put again, here by  
87:38 - platform. And although in other examples, I've 
gotten rid of the legend, the legend is important  
87:45 - in this one because you can see that blue means 
subscribers and red mean visitors. On the other  
87:49 - hand, with a vertical column chart like this where 
things are side by side, having the legend off to  
87:55 - the right isn't really helpful, because you got to 
go back and forth to look. So I'm going to click  
87:59 - on this. And instead of having it on the right, 
I'm going to put it on the bottom. And now you  
88:04 - can see that we have the blue on the left the red 
on the right, and it's the same orientation as our  
88:10 - other data. I'm going to get rid of this because 
it's just taking up space, and we don't need that.  
88:17 - And now it's a little bit closer. And then I am 
going to add one other thing, we don't have an  
88:23 - vertical axis here, I'm going to add that one 
vertical axis title. And I'll put followers  
88:33 - okay. And so this is a basic side by side chart, 
and we can get from this is that we've got a lot  
88:41 - of subscribers in Facebook, we got more there 
than any other platform. And we've got a lot  
88:46 - of visitors on Facebook, but also Instagram and 
a ton on Pinterest. By the way, this is totally  
88:52 - made up data. But you see a different pattern on 
LinkedIn where it's a small number, but we have  
88:58 - more subscribers and visitors. Again, this is made 
up your situation may be completely different. But  
89:04 - I want to show you two other ways of arranging 
a grouped bar chart that gives you different  
89:11 - kinds of insight. Maybe you're not so concerned 
about whether a person's a visitor or subscriber,  
89:18 - but whether they simply come to your site and 
follow you at all. In that case, you can rearrange  
89:24 - the chart by stacking the blue and the red. Here's 
how you would do it. I'm going to copy this chart  
89:32 - and paste it here. I'm going to scroll get 
this drag it down a little bit and then get it.  
89:40 - So this is a simple copy of what we had before. 
But I'm going to double click on it. And this  
89:46 - time I'm going to come to this option under data. 
This is stacking. Right now it says none because  
89:52 - things are right next to each other. They're not 
stacked at all but if I do standard stacking,  
89:57 - now it puts the one on top of the other And 
you can still see that, you know, we've got  
90:02 - more subscribers in Facebook than anything 
else, we got a lot of visitors on Pinterest.  
90:07 - But overall, you can see we're getting 
the most visits from Pinterest,  
90:11 - the second most from Facebook, the third most 
from Instagram. And so you can combine them to  
90:15 - get a total, this can be really, really helpful. 
And in this case, you might actually want to put  
90:22 - the legend back on the right, because you 
want to have things arranged top and bottom.  
90:28 - And so now we have visitors on top subscribers. 
And that might be a better way to do it.  
90:33 - Now there's one other option. And the deal is,  
90:38 - it's hard to compare proportions with this when 
you're able to look at absolute frequencies.  
90:44 - But maybe you want to look at percentages of 
visitors who are subscribers versus regular  
90:49 - visitors. And so we have one more option with a 
grouped bar chart, I'm going to copy this chart,  
90:59 - paste it in, and I won't bring it down here.  
91:06 - We'll scroll up, I'm actually going to 
make a couple of changes on this one,  
91:10 - the first thing I'm going to do, bring it 
up just a little more. And I'm actually  
91:14 - gonna change the chart type. Now right now 
it's a stacked column chart. But again,  
91:19 - sometimes a bar chart, which is the horizontal 
left to right chart might be a better choice.  
91:27 - What I'm going to do here first is I'm going to 
change the kind of stacking instead of standard,  
91:32 - I'm going to go to what's called 100%, where 
it gives us not the frequencies of accounts,  
91:36 - but the proportions of people. And now for 
instance, you see that LinkedIn becomes huge in  
91:41 - terms of the number of subscribers, if we go back 
to standard for a second, you can see that there's  
91:46 - only a small number of people visiting from 
LinkedIn in my artificial data. But the proportion  
91:55 - who are subscribers is huge compared to the 
others. And the proportion or subscribers is  
92:00 - very small, in my Pinterest data, just 10.2%. Now 
I want to show you one other thing you can do, I'm  
92:06 - going to delete this one, and we don't need that 
at all. And I'm going to put a horizontal axis  
92:15 - title to say proportions of followers, 
because remember, point two, five means 25%.  
92:25 - point five means 50%, and so on, I'm probably 
going to put the legend back on the bottom.  
92:34 - And then I'm just going to change the 
colors because I can, I'm going to come  
92:38 - in here and click on the red. And I'm going 
to change it to say for instance, a gray here.  
92:45 - It's a little prettier to look at. But these are 
three variations on group bar charts, they're  
92:52 - showing you both the platform of persons on and 
they're showing you whether they're a subscriber  
92:57 - or visitor. And they give you different insights, 
one allows you to look at the absolute frequencies  
93:01 - next to each other. The second one lets you look 
at the totals. And the third one lets you look  
93:05 - at the proportions. All of them are valid, all of 
them give different perspectives on your data. And  
93:10 - any of that can be used to help you plan what your 
next step should be in your social media campaign.  
93:16 - Most people when they think of spreadsheets, 
they think of Microsoft Excel and Google  
93:21 - Sheets is very similar to excel, a lot 
of the functions carry straight over.  
93:26 - But there are some differences part of it, because 
it's actually a web sheet that gives a lot more  
93:31 - functionality in that respect. But some things 
don't operate quite the way you would think.  
93:37 - If you want to make a bar chart and make 
one of the bars a different color. In Excel,  
93:41 - all you got to do is click on that bar and 
manually change its color. But in Google Sheets,  
93:46 - you have to do it differently. Say for instance, I 
don't have my data here on social media followers,  
93:51 - and I want to draw attention to Instagram. 
Well, it turns out that the way to make  
93:57 - Instagrams bar a different color than the others 
is to actually make a group bar chart. What I'm  
94:03 - gonna do is I'm going to create a second column 
here, I'll call it, highlight. And then I'm going  
94:08 - to take Instagrams value, and I'm going to move 
it over. So this is kind of a funny data because  
94:16 - no platform has values in both of these columns. 
They're in either one or the other. But watch how  
94:22 - this works. I come to social media followers. And 
I click Insert Chart, and it makes it by default,  
94:29 - a group to barter but it's a really funny looking 
one because everything's half width is expecting  
94:35 - information from each of the columns. But if we 
come over here to stacking, and we change it to  
94:42 - standard, then we suddenly have what we want. 
There's a couple of things I want to change,  
94:47 - however that I think are important number one is 
I want to get rid of this legend it's actually  
94:53 - creates confusion. So we get rid of that and we 
need a real title social media iidea followers by  
95:03 - platform. And then I can delete this one here on 
the bottom by just deleting this text over here.  
95:12 - And now we've got a simple bar chart, column chart 
actually, where we are able to draw attention to  
95:18 - one particular category Instagram, by putting a 
value in a different column and making a stacked  
95:23 - bar chart, it's a funny way to have to go about 
it. But it still lets you get to the same goal of  
95:30 - making a clear visualization and drawing attention 
to the important values. Another way of showing  
95:37 - the number of cases or observations in a category, 
in addition to bar charts, is with pie charts.  
95:42 - Now, I have to mention, there's a lot of people in 
the data visualization world who get very upset at  
95:48 - the mere mention of pie charts. But I want to 
point out, there's a few reasons in which pie  
95:53 - charts are actually a good choice. Number one 
is, if you're required by your work to use them,  
95:58 - if you have a template, and they use pie 
charts, that's what you got to use. Second,  
96:01 - there actually is some evidence to say that 
certain groups of people find pie charts easier  
96:07 - to read than bar charts, especially if you're 
talking about allotment of time during the day.  
96:12 - Third, there are some times where a pie chart 
actually can be easy to read, especially if you're  
96:17 - only trying to show one number a percentage. 
But let me give you a few examples here.  
96:23 - I'm going to take the social media followers data, 
and I'm going to come over and click on the Insert  
96:28 - Chart now. By default, Google Sheets makes a good 
choice and creates a bar chart. But we're going to  
96:35 - make things a little different. Now you'll notice 
by the way, that I change the order of things  
96:41 - I put Instagram first. That's because in other 
examples, I wanted to draw attention to Instagram.  
96:47 - But if you're going to have one particular 
category you want to focus on in a pie chart,  
96:51 - it should be the first one, that means it'll 
start at 12 o'clock, and it'll be the one that  
96:58 - leads off the impressions. So what I'm going to 
do is I'm going to come back here to chart type.  
97:03 - And you can see we have right here, a suggested 
type is a pie chart. And this is the default  
97:09 - pie chart or the beach ball or the pinwheel. And 
you know, it's not horrible how it is I'm going  
97:16 - to change a few things. I'm going to change this 
title here. Social media, followers, my platform.  
97:29 - And then I'm going to make one other thing where 
I put some information here and the slice is now  
97:36 - the way I do that is by coming over to pie chart. 
And I'm going to say slice label, each of these  
97:42 - segments is a slice, you say label. Now, 
I realized that what I just put in here  
97:49 - is redundant because it says Instagram here and 
it says Instagram here too. And unfortunately,  
97:53 - I can't control what is displayed 
right here. That's the hard part.  
97:58 - But I'm going to show you a couple of things 
we can do about that. On the other hand,  
98:03 - I want to point out these labels. First 
off, because the medium size is small,  
98:08 - the word medium didn't show up. And Twitter is 
shown in a different color, which under certain  
98:13 - circumstances might be a good idea, but it's a 
little weird in this one, I'm going to fix that  
98:19 - by coming here, again to pie chart. And I'm 
going to make the labels a little smaller.  
98:25 - I think if I go to 14, nope, I gotta go 
smaller still, to 12 point there, then  
98:32 - they're all inside. And I can also change their 
color, I'm just going to make them all white.  
98:38 - So now it's a little more uniform. And it's a 
little easier to read and Instagram, you can  
98:42 - see the one I want to talk about is right here 
at the very beginning. That's nice. But I want  
98:47 - to show you an easier way to draw attention 
to what you want and to avoid some of the  
98:54 - optic, no overwhelm of a pie chart. So what I'm 
going to do is I'm going to copy this chart,  
99:03 - and you copy and paste it and I'll 
make a copy on drag it down here.  
99:14 - And what I'm going to do them is several things, 
but the single most important one is I'm going  
99:19 - to change the chart type. Now there are two ways 
to do this. If we were to come back to data here,  
99:25 - and you see chart, it says pie chart that 
let me show you if you scroll down here,  
99:30 - you can see there are three variations on the 
pie chart. There's this standard pie chart,  
99:35 - there's a donut chart, and that's 
actually the one we're going to use.  
99:38 - But I'm going to show you there's another 
way to get to that. And then there's the  
99:41 - 3d pie chart which is lean back, which actually is 
a horrible thing for data visualization because it  
99:46 - actually distorts the data harder to read. Just 
don't ever use that. But I can get a donut chart  
99:54 - by clicking this one or I can come back 
to customize and you may have noticed this  
99:59 - option early The donut hole right now to 0%. I 
can make it 25%. So it's a little donut hole,  
100:06 - I can make it bigger 50, I can make it bigger 
still, you can enter in any number you want.  
100:12 - 50% seems to work well for a lot of purposes, 
especially if you still want labels in there. Now,  
100:19 - I'm going to make a few other choices, I'm 
going to come back up here to chart style.  
100:25 - And I'm going to do kind of a fun one here, 
which is maximize. And that gets rid of the  
100:30 - title and it makes the chart as big as it can 
be. Then I'm going to come down to legend.  
100:36 - That's these things right here, Facebook, 31.3%, 
Instagram 16.3%, I'm just gonna get rid of that.  
100:45 - So now I just have this colorful donut. I'm going 
to change the colors of each of these, because I  
100:51 - want to draw attention to Instagram. So I'm going 
to click on that. And you have to change each of  
100:57 - these manually. But I can do it pretty quickly. 
I'm going to make all the ones that I don't want  
101:05 - to emphasize a uniform gray, there's a gray that's 
right above the bright green seems to work well.  
101:17 - So all of them get to be that great except 
for the Instagram, which I want to emphasize.  
101:22 - Now there's one major problem here. And that is 
you can't tell where the slices start or stop,  
101:26 - it's really hard to tell. So I'm 
going to click back on these,  
101:30 - I'm going to come back up to pie chart and do a 
border color. And the border color I'm going to  
101:36 - use is going to be a lighter shade of Gray's say 
maybe this one right here. It's not much, but it  
101:42 - makes it possible to tell a part of the slices. 
And so this is a good step. It's a wait to see  
101:48 - that Instagram is about one six, in fact, 
at 16.3%. And you can see how it compares  
101:55 - to the others. Now there's one thing that I 
personally like to do, in addition to this,  
102:00 - and I usually do this in presentation software. 
So if I'm doing this in Google Slides, I'll add a  
102:06 - little piece in there. But it can be done here in 
Google Sheets as well, I'm going to add a number  
102:13 - that says how big this is as a percentage. Now, if 
we come back up here, you'll see that it's 16.3%.  
102:20 - That's good. What I'm going to do is I'm going to 
bring this up, and I'm going to insert a drawing  
102:33 - is kind of a funny way to do it. But it 
works, you know, it's a little bit of a hack,  
102:38 - I'm going to insert a text box, 
I'm going to type in the number  
102:41 - 16%. And then I'm going to make it 
a pretty font, I'll use a garamond.  
102:47 - And then I'm going to make it much larger, 
I'm going to bring it up to 48 point,  
102:55 - I can make that box a little smaller, I hit Save 
and Close. And then it's over here floating on  
103:02 - the side. But I can just click on that. drag it 
over and sort of eyeball to position it in here.  
103:10 - And now what you have is you got a number in 
the doughnut hole that says exactly how big  
103:15 - the one highlighted pieces. And it makes 
it really easy to read. And so this is a  
103:20 - situation where I actually think that pie charts 
or really their relative the donut chart can make  
103:26 - it easier to present a kind of information and 
can give better clarity to your presentation.  
103:34 - When you have a quantitative or measured variable, 
like the price of an order, or the amount of time  
103:41 - somebody spent on your website, or the number of 
kids in a family, you want to make a histogram  
103:47 - as a way of looking at the overall shape of 
the distribution. It helps you see if there's  
103:51 - any spikes in particular places helps to see if 
there's gaps in outliers. So let's take a look at  
103:57 - some artificial data I have here on hypothetical 
orders or totals from particular clients. And  
104:04 - we've got a bunch of rows of data here 113. But 
let's just come over and click on Insert Chart.  
104:12 - One of the things is Google Sheets, again, is 
smart and is able to figure out that a histogram  
104:17 - would be most appropriate for this. There's 
a few things that we need to change. However,  
104:20 - I need to click on this and get rid of the legend 
because it's just silly and taking up space.  
104:26 - And what you can see is that most of the orders 
are down here low it's drawing a box that goes  
104:33 - from $0 to $1,650. Next one to $3,300. By the way, 
the width of these boxes, the fact that it goes to  
104:43 - 1650, then 3300. That's called the bucket width 
or bandwidth. And it's arbitrary. You can make  
104:50 - it as small as you want as big as you want. What 
Google Sheets is doing is it's using a rule of  
104:57 - thumb that says you usually somewhere around seven 
911 bars is best. And so it's dividing the data up  
105:03 - to do that. And you can see, we've got one case, 
way up here, and we got this big gap here in the  
105:10 - middle. This is a skewed distribution, which is 
actually what you expect anytime you're dealing  
105:14 - with something like money. And we've got this 
one big outlier. Now, when you have an outlier,  
105:20 - like this, the first thing you want to do is 
see is that data correct. And if it is correct,  
105:25 - then you get to decide what you want to include 
it in. It may be, for instance, that because it's  
105:31 - so unusual, it represents a different category, 
you don't want to include it with the others.  
105:35 - But let me show you a couple of things 
you can do to help clean up a histogram.  
105:40 - To help decide what's going on with your 
data. I'm going to double click on this.  
105:45 - And well, since it brought me to this one, 
I'm just going to change the color because I  
105:50 - prefer that color. But let me come back up to 
histogram, you can change the bucket size. Now  
105:58 - it's doing buckets at $1,650 each, which I think 
is silly. So I'm going to manually change them to  
106:06 - $1,000 each. And well, it does introduce a lot 
more empty space here. It's easier to read them,  
106:14 - I'm going to change these values here and not have 
them slanted. slanted is really hard to read, I'm  
106:22 - just going to make them straight up vertical. At 
least it's easier to tell what's going on there.  
106:28 - And so this is one way of looking at it, we still 
have this big outlier, we got this huge gap. But  
106:33 - it lets us know where most of our cases are. Now 
Google Sheets does give you one option for dealing  
106:39 - with outliers. Of course, you could just exclude 
it from the data say this is not representative  
106:44 - of the group that we're wanting to deal with. 
Or you could use a different kind of analysis.  
106:48 - But there is one option. So I'm going to double 
click on this coming to the histogram. And as  
106:53 - this one right here, it's outlier percentile. 
And what this does is it takes the highest  
106:59 - certain percent of cases, and it brings them 
down and puts them in the next lowest bar. So  
107:05 - watch what happens when I do this. Right. Now 
we've got this one case up here, we got this  
107:10 - huge gap. And then the next highest is at 5000. 
So if I click this 1%, boom, it brings it way  
107:18 - down. Now what it's also done, unfortunately, is 
it's changed the way it draws the bands and labels  
107:24 - and it gives them these really weird arbitrary 
cutoff points. And unfortunately, there's really  
107:29 - not much you can do about that, you know, you can 
try going down to horizontal axis and manually  
107:34 - setting the value to zero. But once you've done 
the binning thing, it doesn't have any effect.  
107:40 - But it still lets you see the pictures that most 
of our cases are down here, then we got this,  
107:44 - we got this little gap here, then we got a couple 
of cases that are higher, you could do a higher  
107:49 - percentage, if you want it, you could do for 
instance 5%. And you see it changes a little  
107:54 - bit more. But you're never gonna get rid of these 
weird bins down here. So the only way to get rid  
107:59 - of those, by the way is to just back up and do the 
Undo and undo, undo. And now you're back to where  
108:05 - you were originally. But the important thing here 
is that Google Sheets is able to draw a histogram  
108:12 - by default, you're able to see that most of 
your order totals are in the 1000 or 2000 range.  
108:18 - And then you got this really huge gap with this 
one extremely high total up here more than three  
108:23 - times as high as anybody else. But this is the 
purpose of a histogram to help you find these  
108:28 - generalities where most of the orders are, and the 
outliers, exceptions. And so this gives you a good  
108:36 - start on trying to make sense of your orders. And 
what you want to do next in your business. One of  
108:42 - the most important things you can look at in an 
organization is change over time. That might be  
108:48 - the number of customers you have the number of 
people you reach the amount of money you bring  
108:52 - in. There's a lot of different things. And one 
of the best ways of looking at that is with a  
108:58 - line graph, where you have time across the 
bottom and the quantity that you're looking at,  
109:05 - measured vertically. Now I'm going to show you 
how to do both a single line graph and a multiple  
109:11 - line graph. What I have here is a made up data 
of revenue from several different sources for a  
109:17 - nonprofit organization. So we have donations, we 
have events that they run for, say for instance,  
109:23 - ticket sales, we have grants that they receive 
from private or government organizations, and  
109:28 - the total amount of revenue for each month. And 
I've only got it for about a year and a half here.  
109:34 - But this is enough to show us how these kinds of 
graphs work and the value you can get out of them.  
109:40 - I'm going to start by doing just donations, 
although I do have to select a month  
109:45 - also because that's what goes across the 
bottom. So I'm selecting these two columns.  
109:49 - And I come over and I hit Insert Chart. And 
it does a line graph by default and so you  
109:56 - can see that things are kind of flat here at 
the beginning then they There's a big jump.  
110:01 - And by the way, if you just hover over, it can 
tell you what the actual value is already each  
110:06 - point. But there's a few things that would be 
important to modify in this graph. First off, is  
110:12 - I'm going to put not donations versus month that 
makes it sound like there's an opposition, but  
110:18 - donations by month. And then we 
don't need this legend over here,  
110:22 - because there's only one line doesn't tell 
us anything useful. So I'm going to hit none.  
110:29 - And then I'm going to make a couple of 
other modifications to this chart. One is I  
110:34 - don't like you know, the jagged line. So I'm 
going to change its color, I'm going to change its  
110:41 - thickness, I find a thicker line is often easier 
to deal with the four points seems to work well.  
110:46 - And then I'm going to put points on to indicate 
the actual values, the observations. So you see,  
110:51 - now we have a point at each place, that's 
helpful. Another thing you can do is I'm  
110:56 - going to scroll back up to the top here to 
chart style, is I have an option to smooth the  
111:03 - line, because right now it goes 
straight bend, straight bend. And  
111:08 - I think that the jagged parts draw too much 
attention to themselves. So by smoothing it out,  
111:14 - we make it curved, and it's a little 
easier to see the pattern over time.  
111:18 - Now, just as a note, there is a separate smooth 
line chart as a type. So you can choose that if  
111:24 - you want. But since I was just using the automatic 
insert, chart, customizing that seemed like a good  
111:29 - way to go. The next thing I want to fix is this 
over here, we've got 5000 10,000 15,000. It's  
111:36 - easy to read. But the 1000s parse takes up more 
space, and I want so I'm going to click on that.  
111:44 - And I'm going to come here to the vertical axis to 
this scale factor. And when I hit 1000, it divide  
111:52 - all these numbers by 1000. But I need to make sure 
that we don't think we're receiving just $10 in  
111:57 - donations. So I'm going to modify this vertical 
axis title. And then in parentheses, I'll put  
112:06 - 1000s. And then there's one more thing I want to 
do here. And that is right down at the bottom,  
112:13 - it's giving me some of the months and you know, 
maybe that's okay. But personally, I'd like to  
112:19 - see all of them. And so all I had to do is click 
on that and come to this one under horizontal  
112:23 - axis and say treat labels as text. And when I do 
that, it shows all of them. On the other hand,  
112:29 - it also slammed some which is hard to read. 
So I'm going to change that to 90 degrees.  
112:33 - And then I don't think we need this title here 
anymore for the access because it's explanatory  
112:39 - what it is. And so there is a very clear line 
chart that shows the variations in donations  
112:47 - by month from October of 2016 to February of 
2018, it's really easy to see the changes, you  
112:56 - want to see what happened between here and here to 
cause this big spike, what happened to get it all  
113:01 - the way up to this maximum, and why did it fall so 
quickly. And so those are some of the issues that  
113:05 - you're going to want to look at. But fortunately, 
this is what the purpose of this visualization is,  
113:11 - is to bring these things to your attention, so 
you can investigate it. Now, I showed you the  
113:16 - beginning, there's more than one source of revenue 
for this organization. There's not just donations,  
113:20 - there's also events, there's grants, and there's 
a total, we can get all of those into one chart,  
113:27 - show you how that works, when I'm going to 
do is I'm going to make a copy of this chart.  
113:33 - So now I'm going to take this new 
chart, I'm going to drag it down,  
113:39 - move things up, but not all the way I want to 
keep a little bit of the data showing over here,  
113:44 - because I need to change the data that 
I'm using. So I'm going to click on this  
113:49 - and do edit chart, then I'm going to hit data 
range. And when I do that, I can simply come  
113:55 - over to the data. If I do shift command space 
on a Mac, or shift control space on a PC selects  
114:02 - the entire block of data. I hit that and voila, 
there's all my data. Now I'm going to come up  
114:10 - and I'm going to make some changes to this. 
I'm going to come over here and I'm going to  
114:15 - select all series, and I'm going to do all of 
them four pixels thick and all of them was seven  
114:22 - pixel dots. Now, because I changed 
this red one manually, that means this  
114:29 - darker orange one sort of conflicts 
and so I need to change its  
114:34 - color. So I'm going to come here to 
the darker orange one, which is events.  
114:39 - And I'm going to change it to a blue. Great, 
so now we can tell them apart a little better.  
114:46 - Now there's a couple of other things I need to do 
because I changed the nature of the data. Number  
114:51 - one is I need to change the title here because 
this is no longer just donations. I need to put  
114:56 - revenue by Source by month. And then here 
on the side, I need to change donations to  
115:08 - revenue. There we go. And there's one other thing. 
Because I have several different lines, you need  
115:15 - to know which is which. And so I need to put the 
legend back in. So I'm going to put a legend, and  
115:23 - then I'm going to put it on the, well, let's see 
how it looks on the right, there's on the right.  
115:29 - And there is on the bottom. I actually 
think that maybe in this case, the one  
115:34 - on the bottom looks a little bit better, 
because we get a little more linearity  
115:38 - in the chart that we have going across. In any 
case, this is a way of looking at the change over  
115:42 - time of several different values. And it lets you 
see how the multiple sources contribute to a total  
115:50 - and gives you a better picture, in this case, 
the financial health of your organization.  
115:55 - If you want to show changes over time, you do 
have the option of doing the basic line chart  
116:00 - which I've showed elsewhere. But Google Sheets 
also gives you a specialized timeline, which is  
116:05 - designed for things that have months or years 
on the bottom. And a change in quantity,  
116:10 - often financial over time. I'm going to use the 
same data here, and I'm going to show you how to  
116:16 - make this specialized timeline. I'll start with 
just the first two columns month and donations.  
116:22 - And when I click on the Insert Chart, it's 
going to give us the default timeline,  
116:26 - which we've had before. But I'm going to come 
here to chart type. And I'm going to click that  
116:31 - and go way down to the bottom where we have 
the timeline chart. And when I click on that,  
116:39 - it's a different kind of thing, it actually 
gives you some interactive functionality. Now  
116:45 - I'm going to do a couple of things first, just 
to clean it up, and come here to customize.  
116:51 - And I'm going to change the line thickness 
from one to four. So the lines thicker.  
116:56 - And I'm going to give it Fill Opacity, just 10% 
which fills in the area beneath it, and it makes  
117:02 - it a little easier to see what's going on. There's 
one other important thing, you'll see that these  
117:07 - values here go from 5000 to 10,000 to 15,000. 
But they don't start at zero. And in my mind,  
117:14 - they should always start at zero. So I'm going 
to click on this box expand range to show zero.  
117:20 - And now we're setting that's as many 
options as I have for this. But what  
117:24 - I want to show you is that when you come over 
here, you see as I go over a particular value,  
117:32 - it will highlight that value, and give us the 
date and the amount, you can control it two  
117:40 - different ways. Number one is you can come down 
here and you can drag this box to set your own  
117:46 - time range. That's, you know, that's the whole 
point of having the timeline. Or you can use these  
117:51 - zoom buttons, you can say go back to the max, 
show me the last year show me the last six months.  
117:56 - If you've ever worked with financial data on 
the web, you often have these same options.  
118:03 - Now, this is a simple timeline, with 
just one variable being displayed,  
118:07 - we can do more than that. In fact, I'm going to 
come back here and I'm going to copy this chart.  
118:15 - Let me drag that new copied 
chart down, not overlapping.  
118:23 - And what I'm going to do in this 
chart is I'm going to change  
118:27 - the data that it uses. And I'm going to give it 
all of the data, I'm going to come back up here,  
118:33 - just click in here and do this Shift Ctrl or 
Command and spacebar that selects the data.  
118:39 - And now I've got all of it there. And there's 
really nothing else I need to do because it  
118:44 - maintains all the same options that I 
already set. But you know, we can still  
118:49 - do the interactive thing, we can click right here, 
we can come back a little bit. And as I come in,  
118:55 - you see how it says donations, events, 
grants and total up here at the top.  
118:59 - As I come into the chart, it'll give us the actual 
values of each of those as we scroll through. And  
119:05 - so that is a great way to explore the data and 
to see what's happening there as well. And so the  
119:10 - timeline chart, well, it has fewer options overall 
gives you some very specific functions that are  
119:15 - hard to assemble on your own, but give you the 
ability to explore your data in more detail.  
119:21 - Changes in spreadsheet graphics may come 
slowly, but they do come and one of the more  
119:27 - interesting developments in data visualization 
in spreadsheets, and especially in Google Sheets,  
119:33 - is something called a sparkline. Now, this 
is a concept that derives from work by  
119:38 - Edward tufte. He really father of modern data 
visualization. But the idea here is to create  
119:43 - a very small graphic that fits in line with text. 
And in the case of spreadsheets, it means it fits  
119:49 - right in a cell. What I'm going to show you is how 
to make these in cell visualizations for several  
119:56 - different kinds of data because this sparkline 
function in Google Sheets is pretty Be flexible.  
120:01 - Now, this is a formula. So I type equals, and 
then I start typing in sparkline. And you can  
120:08 - see it says it's gonna give me a miniature chart 
within a single cell, I just need to tell it  
120:12 - what data I so I highlight this data, and then 
I close the parenthesis. And then there it is,  
120:20 - I now have a timeline chart, it's really 
small. I'll make it bigger for right now.  
120:28 - Let's scroll down a little. And so now I've 
got this little timeline chart that shows the  
120:35 - variation in donations over time, it sets 
it so that the lowest values at the bottom,  
120:40 - the highest values here at the top, and 
it just moves over one step at a time,  
120:43 - it doesn't indicate months, it's just going from 
this cell to this cell to this cell. But here's  
120:48 - the neat thing, because it's a formula, I can do 
what I do with other formulas, and I can drag it  
120:55 - to apply to other columns. And so now I've 
got this little timeline for each one of them.  
121:00 - This is really a marvelous thing, when 
you've got a bunch of different data sources,  
121:04 - you want to look at them really quickly. 
Also, because they're in each cell,  
121:08 - you know, I can just make the cell bigger 
if I want to, and now the charts are bigger.  
121:14 - Also, you have the option of changing some of the 
properties of each sparkline. So for instance,  
121:21 - this one right here, it looks like it goes 
from really low to really high. But if you  
121:26 - scroll through the data, you see that 
it actually goes from 12,000 to 20,000.  
121:31 - So it's a little misleading to have it start 
that low, we can change, where it starts by  
121:37 - fixing a parameter called y min. So I'm going to 
double click on this. And I come right here. And  
121:45 - I'm going to paste in a comma, and then in curly 
brackets, because that's how you do arguments in  
121:51 - Google sheets for sparklines. I put in quotes, 
why man, that's the thing, I want to change,  
121:56 - comma, and then the value I want it to have, 
I enter. And now you can see it's bumped up  
122:02 - so that it's a little over halfway up. That's 
a big improvement over what we had, you can  
122:07 - change other things as well, you can change 
for instance, the color and the line thickness,  
122:11 - which I'll do with this one, this is our total, 
so it should appear a little bit differently.  
122:17 - I'm going to put in there, two arguments, one, I'm 
going to change the color. And this is a hex code,  
122:24 - it's a way of specifying colors is frequently 
used with computers. This is the dark red that  
122:28 - I've been using in lots of other things, then I 
put a semicolon, because I'm going to include a  
122:33 - second argument, that is line width and two means 
two pixels. And now I've got a total chart, which  
122:43 - is stands apart from the others, but also lets us 
see the change in time. And so this is a really  
122:48 - handy way to look at data. And the flexibility, 
being able to do it in Excel is a fabulous thing.  
122:55 - Now I'm going to come over, I'm going to 
put this back down for a moment to 100%,  
122:59 - I'm going to come over to this next column is 
called win loss. Now you may not be doing this  
123:04 - in your data. This originally comes from Sports 
about whether a team won a game or lost a game.  
123:09 - And then putting in some zeros indicate that 
they didn't play or there was a rain out or  
123:13 - something like that. You can adapt this to other 
things like for instance, whether you got a new  
123:17 - client where they lost a client, I don't know, 
whatever works well for you, I'm going to come  
123:22 - down here and I'm going to put in another 
sparkline. I'm just gonna do a sparkline.  
123:29 - And I'm going to select the data. Now if I just do 
this, by default, it'll draw the same kind of line  
123:35 - graph that I have over in the others. And that 
might be helpful. But with wind loss data, there's  
123:40 - a special kind of sparklines, I'm going to open 
up that one. And I'm going to insert this extra  
123:47 - information, where it's a chart type is when loss 
all one word here. And when I do that, it gives  
123:54 - me this little collection of bars on the top half 
and on the bottom half. Let me zoom in on those.  
124:00 - I'll go back to 200. scroll over a little bit, 
come down here. And so you can see we start with  
124:08 - two wins, we got a couple of rain outs and then 
a loss a win a few losses. And it's a way of  
124:14 - seeing this pattern of a dichotomous variable. 
Over time, you can do things like you can put  
124:19 - different colors for the tops and for the bottom, 
you can put a line through the middle. And you  
124:23 - can there's a lot of options for coloring this. 
But this is the default win loss chart. Now I  
124:29 - want to come and finish with one other one. 
I'm going to back this down to maybe 150.  
124:36 - And that is the social media follower data that 
I've used before. I did this with a repeat chart,  
124:41 - which allowed me to draw just vertical bars using 
a formula all the way across. There is a way to do  
124:46 - this with sparklines. But it takes a little bit of 
adaptation. So let me do this. Enter sparkline and  
124:54 - then I'll tell it the thing I'm going to draw 
is this I'm going to close it print Now I'm  
125:00 - going to get an error message. And the reason 
I'm going to get an error is because it says  
125:04 - you need at least two data points, and I only gave 
it one. But I'm doing a different kind of data. So  
125:10 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to double click 
on this. And then right here, I'm going to insert  
125:15 - that I'm doing a bar chart. So I put comma, and 
then in curly brackets, chart type, comma, bar.  
125:22 - And when I do that, it draws a bar that fills up 
the whole cell, that's actually kind of neat. And  
125:28 - I can drag it down. But you'll see there's another 
problem here, it just automatically assumes that  
125:33 - each bar should go to the maximum. So right now, 
it's not telling us anything, what I have to do  
125:38 - is I have to change the maximum on each of these, 
so that each one of these bars has as its maximum,  
125:46 - the maximum value here in our account, which is 
this 50. So I'm going to double click on this one,  
125:51 - I'm going to come right here, and 
I'm going to insert another argument.  
125:56 - Now when I'm putting is max is equal to the 
maximum of this range of data and I have to  
126:02 - use the dollar sign to and dollar sign seven, 
so that it always stays at row two to row seven,  
126:08 - as I drag the formula down. Now the first 
part is not going to look any different.  
126:13 - But as I drag it down, now you see that all the 
other ones adjust, they show you what proportion,  
126:19 - they are of the maximum score of 50. So 
sparklines are really creative and new way  
126:27 - of visualizing several different kinds of data, 
changes over time, wins and losses over time,  
126:34 - even simple bar charts, but all done within 
cells, which allow you to rearrange them in a  
126:38 - number of ways, they've got a lot of other 
options, you can explore some of those.  
126:42 - But this is an really fun development in data 
visualization in Google Sheets, wouldn't you like  
126:49 - to be able to predict the future or at least try 
to guess how things are going to happen very soon.  
126:56 - One way to do this is with using scatter plots 
and associations between two quantitative or  
127:03 - scaled variables. In this example, I'm looking at 
the number of sales in quarter one and the number  
127:09 - of sales in quarter two of these are totally 
made up numbers. But I want to show you how  
127:13 - to build a scatterplot and get some predictive 
value out of it. Now when I take these data,  
127:20 - and I just click on Insert Chart, by default, it 
gives me the two line charts, which is definitely  
127:25 - not what I want. I want to see how they connect 
one with another. So I click here on chart type.  
127:32 - And one of the suggested charts is a scatterplot. 
And this lets you see the connection between  
127:40 - sales in quarter one and sales and quarter to 
sale. For instance, we got one quarter here,  
127:45 - that was really low in quarter one, it's about 
a 90, but super high in quarter two. So things  
127:52 - went better. What are the others, it was just 
kind of uniform, that quarter two seem to be  
127:57 - pretty consistent. Now I do want to show you 
a couple of ways to modify these charts that  
128:02 - might make it work better for your presentations. 
The first of these is that I'm going to come in  
128:08 - and I'm going to change just for instance, 
the colors, I'm going to change it to red.  
128:15 - And then I'm going to take this option right here 
and add a trendline. What this is, is a straight  
128:21 - line that goes through data that summarizes the 
relationship between the two. And because we've  
128:26 - got this really unusual score over here, that's 
super low on X and super high on y, we end up with  
128:33 - an downhill pattern overall, I can make that a 
little thicker if I want to make it to four point.  
128:40 - And you can change the color and the opacity. But 
I'm gonna do one other thing here, it's gonna say  
128:46 - show r squared. Now, this is a little more 
than I really want to do when I'm talking  
128:51 - about visualization, because this is getting into 
actual data analysis. But this is a statistical  
128:56 - measure of the strength of association between 
two variables, it goes from zero to one and  
129:01 - you read it like a proportion. So the fact that 
this one says trend line for sales, and it says  
129:07 - r squared equals 0.091. That tells you that 9% of 
the variance in quarter two sales can be accounted  
129:15 - for by the variance in quarter one sales. It's 
a technical thing, but it lets you know there's  
129:20 - an association there, but it's small, I'm going to 
do one other thing and then call it quits on this.  
129:25 - I'm going to come back to this trendline. But 
I'm gonna go to series because what I want to do  
129:29 - is I simply want to change the title for this, 
it gives custom labeled trendline for q2 sales,  
129:34 - I'm just going to remove that. So we just 
have the R squared there. And then that  
129:40 - is a good final chart for looking at 
the association between two variables.  
129:43 - If you're familiar with scatter plots, and if you 
understand how regression works, then this is the  
129:48 - best way to look at the association between two 
quantitative variables. You can repeat it for lots  
129:54 - of different possible associations to find the 
variables that can give you the best predictive  
129:59 - insight into what's out happening in your 
organization. If you want to draw a scatterplot,  
130:04 - to show the association between two quantitative 
variables, but you want to draw attention  
130:09 - to one of the observations, you want to, 
for instance, change its color. Again,  
130:14 - in other programs, this might be easy to do, just 
click on the dot change it. But in Google Sheets,  
130:20 - as we saw with bar charts, if you want to change a 
bar, you got to do it in kind of a funny way. The  
130:26 - way it works here is again, we create a new column 
for the one data point that we want to highlight.  
130:33 - So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to have 
our q1 and q2 sales, let's say that we have a new  
130:41 - channel, a new method of making sales, 
and we want to highlight that one,  
130:45 - I'm going to come down here to this 116, because 
I know this is an unusual score. And I cut it out  
130:50 - of there and paste it over here. And now you 
see we've got this one value sitting in this  
130:55 - column all by itself. Let me highlight all of this 
data, just doing the shift command or control in  
131:02 - the spacebar, and then come over to Insert 
Chart. Now what it does is it gives me these  
131:09 - three bar charts, which is definitely not what 
I want, I'm going to come down to scatterplot.  
131:19 - And now when I move this over, you can see 
that the one unusual value is here, all by  
131:26 - itself Way up high. And that accentuates it. 
So we can see that something else is going on  
131:32 - with this particular data set. Now another 
option I have here is to draw a trend line.  
131:40 - And it does the trend line for the collection 
of the data. And you can see that you know, it's  
131:44 - really kind of flat all the way through. And that 
highlights that it's really consistent from q1 to  
131:50 - q2, except for this one special new channel that 
has been massively productive in getting us sales  
131:57 - in the second quarter. So again, it's a little 
bit of a hack. But if you want to highlight the  
132:02 - one of them in Google Sheets, you're going to 
need to put that value into a separate column,  
132:08 - you only need to put one of the values for it into 
a separate column. And that will allow you to put  
132:12 - it in a different color and draw attention 
to it. An important thing to remember about  
132:17 - Google Sheets is that it's made by Google. And 
so it's not just a software company. This is  
132:23 - a very serious Ted company with a very high end 
machine learning and even artificial intelligence.  
132:30 - And they have found ways to bring this into Google 
Sheets. And so I thought I'd end this chapter by  
132:36 - doing something that kind of pulls the rug out 
from under a lot of the other work I did, by  
132:40 - showing you the automatic graphs you can get from 
a new feature in Google Sheets called explore.  
132:48 - If you look way down in the bottom right, you 
will see a green button here that says explore.  
132:55 - And it shows up in several different programs. 
It'll show up in Docs, it'll show up in  
132:59 - slides. But hearing cheats, it does something 
in particular, I'm going to click on explore.  
133:04 - You can also do the Option Shift x, and it brings 
up this window on the right. And it allows you  
133:11 - to ask for instance, like what's the correlation 
between events and donations, these two different  
133:17 - sources. And look, it'll give you a scatterplot. 
It'll even give you a formula. And you can get  
133:24 - this information a lot of these directly from 
right here. You can format the document if  
133:29 - you want to do it in shades of green look, now 
it will do it for you. That's quick and easy.  
133:34 - But the important one is down here with 
analysis, it starts producing a series of  
133:39 - charts and some of these we've made on our own. 
Let's say for instance, this one right here.  
133:46 - The idea is it makes a chart, It even 
gives you a little bit of interpretation.  
133:51 - For every year donations increases by about 
$10,300. That's fabulous. Now, you can also click  
133:58 - on this button, if you want to see it larger, it 
fills it up right there and escape and go back.  
134:04 - Or you can even add it to make it a part of your 
spreadsheet, I'll just click this plus button.  
134:09 - And now it's there in our spreadsheet. 
I'm going to drag it over a little bit.  
134:14 - And then I can come back. I'll get out of that 
one. I'll come back to explore and see what  
134:19 - some of the other charts are. We got a line 
graph, it talks about donations increasing,  
134:24 - we've got this little stacked bar graph. December 
2017 has the highest value for donations and a  
134:31 - value greater than most for events. And if we come 
back up to the top, you see we can even click on  
134:37 - More. It'll do more of this. And so we come 
back down here and then we've got scatter plots,  
134:44 - and bar charts. And donations went down 
in 2016 October. Okay, that pie chart.  
134:55 - It's it's really kind of amazing. And this is 
the sort of thing that as Google can team used to  
135:00 - work on their products, which they spend a lot of 
time on, there will be more and more functionality  
135:05 - here. And so it truthfully, when you start working 
with your data, you may want to go, instead of  
135:10 - waiting for the end, go at the beginning to 
see what explorer offers you both in terms of  
135:16 - pre made charts, and even some suggestions on the 
interpretation, it might save you some time and  
135:22 - give you additional insights that you might not 
have approached through your own means. And so  
135:27 - it's a fabulous, fabulous addition to Google 
Sheets to help make your analysis and your  
135:32 - applications easier. When you've made all of 
your charts in Google Sheets, you've got a lot of  
135:37 - different ways that you can get that information 
out there, you can share the individual sheets  
135:41 - with people, you can save the charts as images 
and put them into presentations or documents,  
135:47 - you can copy them and put them onto websites. But 
I do want to show you one interesting alternative  
135:52 - that works well, because Google Sheets is in fact 
a web application. And that is publishing your  
135:58 - charts to the web. Now I'm going to begin 
with one that isn't even really a chart.  
136:03 - It's this page right here, we just want to publish 
this little bit of text based charts. And so let's  
136:11 - do this. Let's just come right up here to file and 
to publish to the web. Now what is going to ask  
136:19 - is whether I want to do the entire document, 
or just this one page or a particular page.  
136:26 - And what these are actually listed in our graphs 
on pages, I'm just going to pick this first page  
136:31 - is going to ask whether I want to do 
it as a web page or save it as a CSV or  
136:36 - tab separated file or a PDF or something 
else. I'm going to save it as a web page.  
136:41 - And I'm going to hit Publish. And double checks, 
which is a good thing. And then it gives me this  
136:48 - very, very long web address. Now, I'm going to 
go to a incognito browser. So it's not logged  
136:57 - in for me. And I enter that and go to it. And 
check it out. There is my chart. It's my little  
137:04 - repeat chart. And so it's not well formatted. 
But the point is, it's there. And it's a way  
137:12 - of getting the stuff out immediately. Let's 
try a different one, I'm going to go back to  
137:17 - where I was. And of course, this one. And 
let's come down here to the line chart.  
137:25 - And I'm going to come down to this bottom one, 
because I've got several different lines on it.  
137:30 - So this might be the sort of thing that 
you want to share with other people,  
137:33 - I'm going to hit these three buttons right here. 
And that also gets me to the published chart, I  
137:38 - could do it from the File menu as well. I'm gonna 
hit Publish chart, revenue by source by month,  
137:44 - and I have an option of making it interactive or 
making it a static image, I'm going to do this one  
137:49 - as an image. And by the way, you can see down here 
is telling me that the repeat chart is published  
137:54 - Also, I'm gonna hit publish, it's gonna check with 
me again, that's good. And I'm going to copy this  
138:01 - address. And I'll go back to this page, open 
up a new tab, paste it in. And now you can see,  
138:10 - it's a web page. It's up here on docstoc 
google.com. And it's a little fuzzy, because  
138:17 - it actually is low resolution that's about 500 
by 300 pixels. I don't know why it's that small.  
138:22 - But it's available to people and people can 
copy this URL and have access to the document.  
138:29 - Now I want to go a third choice. And that is let's 
come over to the timeline, because I've got this  
138:37 - same data about revenue sources, revenue streams. 
And I'm going to take this more complex one. Now,  
138:44 - one of the cool things about timelines is that 
they are by nature interactive, you can come here,  
138:49 - say I want just the last one year, I want the 
last six months, of course, it's going to bring  
138:54 - up this editing window. So I'll slide things over. 
And you've got this little slider right here you  
138:59 - can use as a way of changing the timeframe 
you're dealing with. That's all very cool.  
139:05 - So let's come up to these three little dots and 
say, publish the chart. Now the last one I did as  
139:12 - an image, this one I'm going to make interactive. 
So I'm going to hit publish, it's going to ask me  
139:17 - if I want to do that. I'm going to copy that 
address. So it's already highlighted. Go to my  
139:23 - other page, open a new tab and put the address in 
there. And what you'll find is it actually doesn't  
139:28 - look exactly the way it was before. It's arranged 
a little differently. So for instance, these  
139:34 - three sources are listed on the left as opposed to 
across the top. But you do get the numbers as you  
139:42 - go through. And you do have this zoom thing. 
This is still available, but we've lost  
139:46 - the thing to drag across the bottom, the timeline 
selector which is unfortunate because that's one  
139:51 - of the best ways of interacting. So not perfect, 
not complete, but it is a really nice way to share  
139:58 - things by just giving people a webpage, give them 
a link. And they can start interacting with your  
140:04 - data in certain ways and start getting some of the 
same insights out of it that you had. Now, I want  
140:10 - to finish with one little thing here, I'm going to 
close these three tabs. And that is, once you have  
140:16 - stuff published, you know, the time may come, you 
don't want it to be out there anymore. And so what  
140:21 - you need to do is come down here, this is showing 
us what's published, we can't scroll up very much  
140:28 - here. But you see the checkmarks, next to the 
things that are published, just stop publishing.  
140:36 - And those links will no longer be active, and 
the stuff is back in your private control. So  
140:41 - publishing is one interesting, not perfect, but an 
interesting method of getting your information out  
140:48 - there, sharing your message, sharing your data, 
and then being able to get insight from the people  
140:54 - around you. When people think about computers and 
data, a lot of times they think about things like  
140:59 - machine learning and these artificial intelligence 
algorithms that do these incredibly complicated  
141:04 - things. But it turns out that the vast 
majority of tasks that we need to do with data  
141:10 - are simple arithmetic, addition and subtraction, 
multiplication and division. And these are really  
141:17 - easy to do in Google Sheets with formulas. 
But one thing we need to get started with is  
141:23 - cell references. So when you're writing a formula, 
you need to have Google Sheets refer to the right  
141:30 - sell. And you can do this with what are 
either called relative references or  
141:34 - absolute references. And I'll demonstrate both. 
We'll begin with relative references. What I have  
141:40 - here is a list of the numbers one through 10. 
And I want to take each of those numbers and I  
141:45 - want to multiply it times two. And I'm going 
to start by writing a formula, all I do is I  
141:51 - type equals, that tells Google Sheets, I'm going 
to write a formula. And then I click on the cell,  
141:55 - I want to multiply it's one over to the left, and 
I multiply it times two, I do asterisk to great,  
142:04 - and when I do that, you can see a preview of 
what these answers gonna be. I just hit it. And  
142:09 - there's a two, if you want to see again, what's 
going on here, just double click on this cell.  
142:16 - And it will highlight the cell is referred 
to and you see the color here is orange and  
142:20 - the matches here. If you have more than one cell 
reference, it will do them in different colors.  
142:24 - But you can see that there's a formula there. 
And then I'm going to click on that one. And  
142:29 - I'm going to drag it down. And what is going to do 
is is going to maintain the relative reference is  
142:34 - going to say, at each step, take this cell that is 
one over to the left, and multiply it times two,  
142:42 - if you want to see what all the formulas look 
like you can do Ctrl tilde where the tilde on  
142:48 - the keyboard is above the tab. And that shows you 
all the formulas and you see it goes to a three to  
142:54 - a four to a five, so on down to a 12 and 
multiply times 12. That's a relative reference,  
142:59 - because all it says is go one to the left. 
It doesn't say go to column A and although  
143:05 - it has an a written here, but it just is 
interpreted as the next one to the left.  
143:11 - Now there's other ways to do it, you don't have 
to refer just to the left, when we turn off the  
143:16 - view formulas, you may want to do a running total, 
in which case we do a combination of things.  
143:21 - First, I'm going to write a formula 
that says copy this one right here.  
143:25 - That's the simplest possible formula. 
And then for each subsequent formula,  
143:29 - I'm going to say take the number that's right 
above and to that add the number that's to  
143:36 - the left. Okay, so one above and add one to 
the left. And if I take that and drag it down,  
143:45 - you'll see that in each point, it's taking the 
number that's immediately above and the number  
143:50 - that's immediately to the left and adding them 
up, and I get a running total of by the time  
143:55 - I get to the bottom here 110. That actually is 
a useful thing to do. If you're keeping track,  
144:00 - say for instance of invoices, and you need to know 
the total expenditures doing this running total  
144:05 - is actually how you would do it and relative 
references will be useful for that one. On the  
144:10 - other hand, sometimes you say don't just go one 
to the left or one above. But you need to tell it  
144:15 - to refer to a specific column or a specific row 
even when you're moving things around. That's  
144:22 - where you get the idea of an absolute reference. 
Now, I'm going to multiply numbers in this little  
144:27 - table. And I'll show you really how not to do it. 
We'll start by saying I'm going to type in equals  
144:32 - to say so formula will take one to the left. And 
I'll type an asterisk to multiply and I'll do it  
144:38 - one to the top. Okay, one times two is easy. 
But watch what happens if I drag that down.  
144:46 - It's not going to do five times two here is 
doing five times six. And if I drag that all  
144:50 - to the right, then I end up with some really 
big numbers instead of this should be 30 down  
144:55 - here instead of 3 million. And so that's not 
what we Want to do, I'm going to back that up.  
145:02 - Instead, I need to tell it that when it goes 
to the left, it needs to always go to column E.  
145:09 - And when it goes to the top, it needs to always 
go to row two. But even though it always goes  
145:14 - to column E, it will sometimes need to go to 
this number or this number or this number,  
145:19 - depending on the row it's in. So we're going to do 
a combination of relative and absolute references.  
145:26 - And the way to tell it to always go to one 
particular column or one particular row  
145:30 - is to use $1 sign on the US keyboard that's 
above the four. And that says, always go to E,  
145:39 - although it can adjust the row. And over 
here, it says you can adjust the column but  
145:46 - always go to row number two. And when I do 
that, watch what happens, I can drag that.  
145:55 - And now it works the way I want to. So if I click 
on this one, you can see it's multiplying that  
146:01 - number and that number. If I click on this 
one is doing that number in that number.  
146:06 - And if I do this cell is going to six times five, 
which is 30. And so that's one way to do it. Now,  
146:13 - by the way, there is a more sophisticated way 
of using something called an array formula here.  
146:18 - But that's a special circumstance. And I'm 
not going to get into that. And there's one  
146:22 - other situation where you may want to use absolute 
references on both dimensions. Now, what I'm going  
146:28 - to do is I'm going to recreate this table here, 
by simply saying equals, and I'll come up here.  
146:35 - And I'm going to copy all those values. 
These are relative references, by the way.  
146:41 - And there we go. So I've got them all there. But 
I want to multiply each of these numbers times 10,  
146:46 - which means it always has to go to exactly 
this cell, which is e eight. And so what  
146:52 - I need to do is I click on this formula here, 
and I write an asterisk to do multiplication,  
146:57 - I'm going to click on this cell E eight, but 
then I'm going to put $1 sign before the E  
147:04 - and $1 sign before the eight. And then when 
I drag it down, it will always refer to that  
147:12 - specific cell when doing the multiplication. 
So for instance, if I click right here,  
147:17 - you can see he's taking that 
number multiplying it times that  
147:21 - here, it's doing the relative reference up to 
here, but the absolute reference to this cell.  
147:26 - And the same thing here, relative reference 
to this one, but always referring to this one  
147:30 - back. So that's the combination of absolute and 
relative references. The way that you combine them  
147:36 - gives you more flexibility in how you create 
your formulas, and more power and how you set  
147:41 - up your analyses. Some of the most useful 
things you can do in a spreadsheet are also  
147:46 - the most basic. So I want to show you some of the 
most important formulas, you'll use most often,  
147:53 - to get the first types of insight out of your 
data. The three that I want to show you with  
147:59 - one variation on them our count and sum and 
mean, a count is used to simply decide how many  
148:06 - values you have in front of you, it's getting 
your sample size. And what I'm going to do is  
148:12 - I'm going to take this series of dates here. 
And I've imagined, like we have a yoga studio,  
148:17 - and we've got the number of people attending a 
group class on each day. Now, please note, one  
148:23 - of these is not a number, it's text I wrote down 
because the Fourth of July is a holiday in the US.  
148:29 - But let's do this first one, which is count. 
Now, I can do this two different ways I can  
148:33 - type equals and then the word count. But 
because this is one of the basic formulas,  
148:39 - there's a shortcut to it. If I come right up here, 
this is a Greek sigma, that's the summation sign.  
148:46 - If I simply say count, it inserts equals count 
and then the parentheses and it simply wants to  
148:53 - know what data should account. And I'm going 
to drag, click and drag over these numbers.  
149:02 - And when I hit return, I get 13. So there are 13 
numbers here. The thing to remember about count  
149:08 - is it only counts how many numbers there are, so 
it ignored this piece of text. On the other hand,  
149:15 - there may be situations where you need to 
include even written things you need to include  
149:21 - any kind of information that's in the cell. And 
in that case, you're gonna want to use a small  
149:26 - variation called count a, you can think of count 
as count all not just numbers, but everything.  
149:32 - And this one, I am going to type out I'm going to 
put equals, and then I'm going to type in count a  
149:39 - and that pops up right there. So I can 
click on that. And then I'm going to  
149:43 - click and drag over the data. And then I'm going 
to put a closing parenthesis and hit return.  
149:50 - And that tells us that there are 14 values 
within this range of data. There are 13  
149:58 - numbers within that range. But there are 14 
values, 14 cells that have something in them.  
150:04 - So counting can be very important just for 
counting how many entries you have. Even  
150:11 - more useful, it's going to be adding things 
up some. And some, it's really easy to do.  
150:17 - I'm going to put my cursor right here, select that 
cell, and I'm going to come back up and hit some.  
150:24 - And it simply wants to know what data to add 
up. So I'm going to click and drag over these.  
150:30 - And I have a sum of 170. So over 14 days, we had 
13 classes at the yoga studio, and we had a total  
150:38 - of 170 people show up, which raises the next 
question, if we had 170, people show up over  
150:46 - 13 classes, what's the average number of people 
per class? Now there's two ways to do this. One  
150:53 - is to simply take this sum and divide it by 
the count. That is the definition of a mean.  
150:59 - But I can also use the built in formula for me, 
which is nice, because it's going to ignore,  
151:04 - for instance, that piece of text in there as 
well. So I'm simply going to have this cell,  
151:10 - come over here and click average, the average 
and the mean, in most situations refer to the  
151:16 - same thing. It's where you get a total of 
the number of people or the amount of money  
151:21 - the amount of time and you divide it by the 
number of cases you're distributed across,  
151:26 - I'm going to hit average, and then simply drag 
over these numbers, hit return. And that tells  
151:34 - me that have an average of 13.1 people in each 
class period. Obviously, sometimes it's higher,  
151:41 - sometimes it's lower, we go from seven to 21, but 
an average of 13. And so these are very simple  
151:48 - operations, simply counting how many numbers you 
have, adding them up and getting the average.  
151:55 - But you're also going to find those are going to 
give you an enormous amount of insight, the simple  
151:59 - operations are most often the most effective in 
getting meaning out of your data. And these simple  
152:06 - arithmetic procedures are very simple to do 
with the built in functions in Google Sheets.  
152:12 - More than anything, a spreadsheet, like Google 
Sheets is a container for data. And one of  
152:19 - the important things to remember is that data 
comes in lots of different forms. A lot of its  
152:24 - numerically based, but even then you can format 
it in many different ways. And there is also  
152:29 - non numeric data. And Google Sheets can handle a 
huge amount of this. And I want to show you some  
152:35 - of those variations. So you know what you can 
put in and adapt to your own purposes. The most  
152:42 - obvious one, of course, is just plain old numbers, 
like this integer 1587, you put those in there,  
152:48 - Google Sheets will usually put them flush, right 
text is usually flush left, you can tap those,  
152:53 - and you can get a lot out of just those kinds of 
counting numbers. On the other hand, you can also  
153:01 - get proportions which are red like percentages. 
So this is 0.87 is the same as 87%. In fact,  
153:09 - if you want to see it as a percentage, you can 
just take that proportion, and you can click  
153:14 - here on the format is percent key. And there 
it is, it even gives you two decimal places.  
153:18 - But it's obviously 87%. You also have the option 
of just typing it in as 87%. I'll do it like this.  
153:32 - And that also works as a percent. If I press the 
percent sign there, now you see how it works.  
153:37 - Now, there's one thing you don't want to do, and 
that is type in a number 87. And then think if you  
153:42 - do this, it can turn it into 87%, it turns into 
80 700%, which is obviously not what you want.  
153:48 - So you need to start with a proportion, the point 
eight, seven, and it turns it into percentages.  
153:55 - You can also put in the number like pi and you 
can decrease the decimals, which is good because  
154:00 - pi has infinite decimals. So it can make a little 
smaller if you want. Or if you have a number  
154:07 - with a lot of decimals already entered. And I'm 
using the PI function here. You can increase the  
154:12 - decimals, I don't know that you really need a lot 
more but they're available if you want them. Now  
154:18 - often the information you're going to be entering 
into a spreadsheet is going to be financial, you  
154:22 - can have money, you're going to be keeping track 
of purchases and payments. And you have several  
154:28 - different options. One is the accounting format. 
So if you're an accountant, you're familiar with  
154:33 - this, but you come up to format to number and then 
come down here to accounting. And what it does is  
154:40 - it puts the comma and for the 1000s. It puts the 
dollar sign way over here. Okay, that's pretty  
154:47 - easy. You can also do financial formatting, which 
is similar in certain ways. I'll come down here  
154:55 - and you'll see it puts in the comma but otherwise 
it doesn't have dollar sign in formats a little  
155:01 - bit differently. And there's also currency. And 
you can set your local currency in Google Sheets.  
155:11 - I'm going to use dollar, that's where I am. And so 
you can see now it puts a little bit differently.  
155:17 - And it's three different ways of representing the 
same information. Now, I realized they're slightly  
155:22 - different each other, it becomes a little more 
pronounced when you make the numbers negative.  
155:28 - So I'm going to put a negative there, and now 
you see it puts it in parentheses, that's a  
155:33 - common thing in accounting. And with financial, 
it also puts it in parentheses. But when it comes  
155:38 - to currency, they appoint a negative, it sticks 
in front of the dollar sign. So a few different  
155:44 - ways of dealing with money, depending on what's 
the most common practice in the work that you do.  
155:49 - You can also put in dates, you just type 
them in seven slash 16, it'll format them,  
155:55 - and then I'll show you in another video, there's 
a lot you can do with dates in Google Sheets.  
156:01 - And you can also use time, so for instance, 10 
1031, just enter it as hours, and then colon,  
156:08 - minutes, colon, and seconds. So those are all 
numbers. And there's a lot of things you can  
156:13 - do with numbers. But Google Sheets is able to 
handle a lot more than that it's able to handle  
156:18 - well. For instance, it can handle text, so 
you can just type in words. And it turns out,  
156:25 - there's a lot of functions that allow you to deal 
with words. And I'll give you examples of those  
156:29 - in a later movie. You can put in web links, if you 
type in a valid web address, I just typed in data  
156:36 - lab.cc, my address, it recognizes that as HTTP, 
although it should be HTTPS, because I have an SSL  
156:44 - certificate. And those are live links, you 
can click on them, and it'll take you there.  
156:50 - So here for instance, I have my website data lab 
now opening because I had it here in the cell,  
156:57 - the same thing works, you can put email addresses 
in there, it'll work a lot of different ways.  
157:03 - You can put web data, this is an interesting 
one. This is a special function that calls in  
157:10 - Google Finance data. So this is today's 
stock price for Google $1,066 a share.  
157:18 - And by the way, notice that we get this 
little disclaimer down here at the bottom,  
157:23 - if I were to delete that the disclaimer would 
go away. Of course, you can use formulas,  
157:28 - and I've used a few of them already and have a 
lot more say about formulas. So for instance,  
157:33 - the formula that pulls up this data is 
Google Finance, and then in parentheses in  
157:39 - quotation marks goog, because that's the symbol 
for Google on financial markets. And one other  
157:45 - interesting thing you can do in Google Sheets he 
can't do in every spreadsheet, is you can include  
157:51 - images. Now, this is an image that is on the 
web, it's it's my company logo, and you do  
157:58 - image and then you put the URL for that image in 
quotes. Nice thing is if I make this cell bigger,  
158:07 - that you know it increases in size as well. So 
you can put an image in a cell, if you can link it  
158:14 - from a URL, put that one back to where it was. 
And then finally, you have the option of including  
158:22 - floating images and a number of other things. Let 
me give you an example of that. I'm going to come  
158:27 - right here to insert, you can put in a chart, an 
image, a drawing of form, checkboxes, columns, and  
158:33 - I'll talk about a lot of those. Let me just insert 
an image for right now, the one thing you need  
158:38 - to know when you include an image, I'm just gonna 
get one off on my desktop, I got my data lab icon.  
158:46 - The one thing you need to know is that it's a 
floating image. And so it's not in the cell,  
158:50 - you can drag it around, it's also really big, 
I'm going to make it smaller. So it's not linked  
158:57 - to this cell. And that's a little different from 
this web image that we have in the cell. But it is  
159:03 - possible to include this information, especially 
if you're trying to build up a repository  
159:08 - or even have a sort of a branding with your 
spreadsheets, it gives you many different options.  
159:14 - And so what you can see from all of this is that 
Google Sheets is able to serve as a container  
159:19 - for a lot of different kinds of data, each of 
which might arise in different circumstances  
159:25 - in your own work. Numbers are probably what come 
to mind for most people when they think about  
159:31 - spreadsheets. And that's reasonable, because 
I'm willing to bet that most spreadsheets are  
159:36 - in fact filled with numbers. But spreadsheets 
are more powerful than that and more flexible.  
159:42 - They can use text as well, which is good, because 
when you're working in an organizational setting,  
159:48 - chances are you're going to have to work with 
a lot of texts, like people's names and their  
159:52 - addresses and what their last orders were. And the 
nice thing is you can work with that. I want to  
159:59 - show you A few specific functions that can be very 
helpful in particular dealing with names in Google  
160:05 - Sheets. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to 
show you these using the name Ruth St. Denis. Now,  
160:11 - if you don't know Ruth St. Denis, she's one of the 
founders of American modern dance. And even though  
160:17 - her name looks like it should be pronounced, Ruth, 
Sandra, nee, she's American. So it's St. Denis,  
160:24 - the first thing we want to do is simply find 
out how many characters there are in a cell.  
160:29 - And that's a really simple one, because 
we have a function called Len for length.  
160:34 - And it counts the number of letters and spaces and 
punctuation. So we have 14 pieces of information  
160:42 - in this particular cell. Great, that's a starting 
point for a lot of other things. Now, we might be  
160:48 - looking for a particular piece of text. And 
in this case, I'm going to look for the first  
160:52 - space, because for a lot of people that's going 
to separate their first name from their last name.  
160:58 - And the function I use for that is called 
find, you simply need to tell it, what is  
161:03 - you're trying to find. And I have quotation marks 
with a space that they put in between them says,  
161:09 - find the first space in this cell. And return 
is location, which is a number. And it's five,  
161:16 - because we have Ruth is 1234 letters and the space 
is the fifth thing in that particular cell. Next,  
161:24 - we want to select the text up to the first 
blank that is get her first name. And the  
161:30 - way we're going to do that is with the function 
Left, left says start at the left in this cell,  
161:37 - and go how far I'm saying five characters. And 
the reason I know five is because that's what  
161:42 - we got when we were looking for the first blank 
here. Can we do that we get her first name, Ruth.  
161:49 - Now to get her last name, I'm going to 
say get everything else. Now because  
161:56 - 14, which is the total length minus five, which 
is where the first space is 14 minus five is nine,  
162:03 - I'm going to simply do that. This one, however, 
is going to be starting from the right.  
162:08 - And so I use the function right says 
go to the end of this cell and then  
162:13 - count back to the left nine spaces that gets us to 
the s and St. Denis. And there's your first name.  
162:21 - Also, a lot of times when you get information 
in your spreadsheet, it might be a little weird,  
162:27 - you might have spaces where they shouldn't be have 
spaces before the name after the name. And you  
162:33 - often want to clean those things up. So things 
work a little better. So for instance, I have  
162:38 - Ruth St. Denis here, and you may not be able to 
tell, but there are three spaces before her name.  
162:44 - And there are also three spaces after her name. 
So we're going to get rid of those by using the  
162:49 - function developed specifically for this called 
trim. And it gets rid of all of the leading  
162:56 - and trailing spaces. And so now we have Ruth St. 
Denis without the stuff before after. Now, you  
163:04 - may have guessed that it's possible to combine all 
of these in a logical algebra for processing text.  
163:12 - So for instance, maybe you have people entering 
their names all in one cell when they're filling  
163:17 - out a form on your web page. So here I have Ruth 
St. Denis, I want to split it into her first name  
163:23 - and last name, because that's how I want to store 
it in my database, I can combine these functions.  
163:29 - And this is going to be a little complicated. But 
here's how it works. I get Ruth, but the way I got  
163:36 - it, was it by first saying God has cell been nine, 
that's where the name is, go to the left, and then  
163:43 - find the first space in that cell. And then trim 
everything that comes after it. And when I do  
163:50 - that, I get Ruth. If I want just her last name, I 
can use the compliment of that. And in this case,  
163:59 - it looks like this, we're going to do a 
combination of get the right which is how I got  
164:05 - the last name, but we have to do the length of the 
wholesale minus the space up to the first space.  
164:11 - And then we trim the extra stuff at the end. So 
yeah, there's a lot of parentheses here. And it's  
164:16 - a little complicated, which is why I actually do 
use this formula. I have a database with names  
164:22 - in it. And I do this to rearrange the way they 
come in natively, so that they make more sense  
164:27 - to me. And so I have to use all this stuff. But I 
tell you, it takes me a few minutes to get it all  
164:33 - worked out. But then I just copy it and drag 
it down and it takes care of everything in the  
164:37 - spreadsheet. It's really nice. On the other hand, 
what if things come last name, comma first name,  
164:44 - well, then you simply do a little bit of 
rearranging. In this case, you're going to do  
164:51 - the trimming, you're simply switching what we had 
here to over here. That's quick and easy. You're  
164:56 - searching for the comma in this case And you're 
getting the stuff that it comes after the comma,  
165:03 - but trimming the spaces. And then the last 
one is for the last name, you do have to make  
165:09 - one small modification here. And that is you 
have to tell it, we're going to find the comma,  
165:17 - we're going to get the left part. But you need to 
include this minus one to adjust the selection,  
165:22 - because you're doing from the comma, and then 
you trim the blank spaces, and then you have  
165:27 - what you need. So all of these are different 
functions. In fact, let me turn on the  
165:32 - Variable View the function view. And now you 
can see what's going on as a way of cleaning  
165:38 - up organizing, getting the information you need. 
So you can stick it in your own customer database,  
165:44 - and get it set up. So you can then process it 
using other functions that can combine text,  
165:50 - and numbers and whatever else you need to suit 
your purposes. One of the neat tricks you can do  
165:56 - in a spreadsheet like Google Sheets 
is you can use formulas not only to  
166:00 - look at numbers, or even to select text, but to 
start combining text with calculations, which  
166:08 - is sort of like doing a form fill on a letter. But 
it gives you a lot more control and flexibility, I  
166:16 - want to show you a few different ways of combining 
information. They all accomplish the same thing.  
166:23 - But they give you different approaches to it. 
And depending on how many items you're using,  
166:29 - you might want to choose one or the other, I use 
all of these in my own work. Let's go back to this  
166:35 - fictional example of say, for instance, a 
yoga studio. And you've got seven days here,  
166:41 - and you're keeping track of attendance in the 
group yoga classes. So you got 31 on Monday,  
166:48 - 26. On Tuesday, things drop off by 30, 
you're down to seven, then people feel bad,  
166:52 - and they start showing up there on the weekend. 
And so you have 134 people total showing up in  
166:59 - those seven days. But let's find out how you 
can use some special functions and Google Sheets  
167:06 - to combine that into a report. So I'm 
going to come over here for a moment.  
167:12 - And I'm going to paste in a little bit 
of information. First, let's put in the  
167:16 - beginning of a sentence you had a total of 
and then we're going to put a formula here.  
167:23 - Now this formula is simply 
referring to this data. Over here,  
167:29 - it's just the sum is the same formulas down 
here. Okay, so we've got that. But now let's  
167:36 - put the second part of a sentence, I'm going to 
turn off the formula display here for a moment.  
167:42 - You had a total of 134 visitors this 
week. And so what this is, is some text,  
167:49 - a number that's derived from a 
formula, and then a little more text,  
167:52 - we want to put them all together into a single 
sentence. Now we've got a few ways to do this.  
167:58 - The first one is with this. Now, here's You see, 
there's a problem with this one, by the way,  
168:05 - what I've done is I've simply said use this 
cell, and this cell and this cell. So you use the  
168:13 - and sign the ampersand to get from one to the 
other. That's great, except as you can tell,  
168:19 - it doesn't put spaces in and so you need to add 
the spaces manually. And the way you do that,  
168:26 - is by inserting two more parts here. You 
put in quotes with a space. And so it says,  
168:34 - Take this first cell, add a space, add the second 
cell, add a space, add the third cell. And so that  
168:41 - works. And that can be a useful way of combining 
the information and making sure it's formatted  
168:47 - the way you want to it looks like a proper 
sentence. And it's not clear to people that  
168:51 - you're actually doing some math to make 
these things happen. Another way to do it,  
169:00 - is to actually include the formula in there 
itself, because in this one, I'm using the sum  
169:05 - that comes from appear. This one I'm including 
a formula that refers back to the original  
169:11 - column. So there may be times when you want to do 
the calculations in your sentence, or you simply  
169:16 - want to refer to the calculations that are done 
elsewhere. Obviously, the result is identical.  
169:23 - Another option is to use the sentences 
right there in the cell itself. So let me  
169:30 - highlight this one. This time I'm typing you had 
a total of and I'm including the space in there.  
169:36 - Then I put the ampersand then I put the formula 
sum, and then ampersand the and sign and then  
169:43 - quote and include the space here and then visitors 
this week. And so the only thing that's going on  
169:49 - here is I'm inserting that sum that makes it 
possible to get the rest of the information.  
169:55 - And then there are two other ways that we can do 
this. There's a special function called Join. And  
170:01 - when you use join, what it does is it lets you 
specify the cells you want to put together. And  
170:09 - the thing you want to stick in between each cell. 
In this case, I'm putting quotes with a space,  
170:15 - and then comma and say join this one in 
this one. In this one, I can also use  
170:19 - D two colon f2 to specify the range. But it's 
a really quick and easy way. Sometimes when you  
170:26 - have a lot of things to put together, the join 
statement is going to be easier. Although I find  
170:31 - the and statement where you're using the Add sign 
can be a little clearer about what's going on.  
170:36 - And then finally, one other option is to 
use join, but to this time, have the formula  
170:43 - for the sum right in here. So it's a self 
contained statement. So it's referring  
170:50 - to this one joining with that joining with 
that. Anyhow, you can use ampersand the and sign  
170:56 - as long as you remember to put a space in by 
putting, quote, space quote, or you can use join,  
171:04 - either one allows you to combine text, along with 
calculations based on the information. I use this  
171:11 - a lot in spreadsheets as a way of creating 
a sort of mail merge, I use it to create the  
171:17 - subject lines for emails to have boilerplate 
text for emails. And so I just have to copy one,  
171:23 - paste it into the subject, copy a second, paste 
it into the text. And I'm good to go and is based  
171:29 - on a whole series of calculations combining 
text that's in my spreadsheet. So it gives  
171:34 - you extra flexibility and extra power to work 
with different kinds of data to get it to best  
171:40 - fit with your particular need. formulas in Google 
Sheets can be used not only to multiply numbers,  
171:48 - or to select text, or to combine things like that, 
they can also be used to do some basic formatting.  
171:55 - And what's really nice about this is you can use 
these conditional formats, which are formula based  
172:02 - formats to highlight data bring your attention 
to, for instance, to things that are performing  
172:06 - very well, very poorly, issues that need to be 
resolved. I use them frequently to help me find  
172:12 - open cases. And let me just show you quickly how 
this works. Start by selecting the text that you  
172:19 - want to format. So for instance, I'm going to come 
here to teacher. Now, this is something that could  
172:26 - do easily on my own. But if you had a very long 
list, you wouldn't want to do this manually. Let's  
172:32 - highlight a particular teacher. And so what I do 
is I select this text, and then I come over to  
172:39 - format and down to conditional formatting, that's 
going to open up a little window here on the side.  
172:46 - And it's going to apply to this range, see 339. 
That's the range I have selected here. And we're  
172:54 - going to tell it, well, right now it says cell 
is not empty, well, they all have stuff in them,  
173:00 - I'm going to say instead that the text 
contains, and then I'm going to put the name  
173:07 - of one of the teachers Emmanuelle. We have 
Kofi Alex and Emmanuel, and then I'm just  
173:12 - gonna leave this default, I can change the 
color if I want by clicking on one of these,  
173:16 - I don't need to I'm gonna hit Done. And now, if 
a manuals name pops up as the teacher, then it  
173:24 - automatically gets highlighted. And if I were to 
change one of the other cells to say manual, it  
173:28 - would automatically inherit that, in fact, let's 
do that right here. Let's change this one to say,  
173:36 - I got to spell it correctly. emanuelle ac, 
it inherits the conditional formatting.  
173:43 - Next is what if I want to highlight not just that 
person's name, but the entire row that they're in,  
173:49 - this is actually what I use, I use a 
spreadsheet as a large database for  
173:54 - assigning teachers to classes. And when a class 
isn't assigned as a staff, but I want the whole  
174:01 - row to highlight. And so I'm going to select this 
entire rectangle of data. So not just the teacher,  
174:08 - but also the attendance and the dates. I'm 
going to get the whole bit of information,  
174:13 - then I'm going to come over to conditional 
formatting, I'm going to add a new rule. And the  
174:18 - rule I'm going to add is a slightly funny one, 
you may not guess this one, I actually have to  
174:25 - come down here to custom formula. And what I want 
to tell it to do is if the teacher is a manual,  
174:33 - then highlight the entire row. And it goes counter 
intuitively like this. I write equals and then the  
174:43 - dollar sign seeds, they always look at column 
C and then 13 is there because that's the first  
174:50 - row in the block. And then if that cell is 
equal to a manual, and because it's text,  
174:57 - I have to put it in quotes, then highlight it 
So that's what we've got right here. I hit Done.  
175:04 - And you see how it's highlighted. And again, 
if we were to change another name to Emmanuel,  
175:11 - you see how the entire row inherits 
that highlighting. And again,  
175:15 - this is really useful for identifying important 
clients. It's for identifying unassigned cases,  
175:21 - it's useful for identifying any number of 
situations that you can describe with a formula.  
175:27 - And then finally, another good one is what's 
called a color scale. I'm going to come over  
175:33 - here where I have the information again, I'm 
going to select just the attendance information.  
175:39 - And I'm going to select a new rule here. Now, 
not a single color, which is what I've been  
175:44 - doing so far, but a color scale. And what this 
does is it lets me choose a range of colors  
175:50 - that go from the minimum value through the 
midpoint up to the maximum. Now I don't want  
175:54 - the green to be the low and I'm going to switch it 
the other way around, I've got some choices here.  
176:00 - I'm going to pick this one. So it goes from 
white to green. And it highlights the higher  
176:07 - values I'm going to hit Done. And what you 
can see now is that the darkest screen is on  
176:13 - the day that we had 31 people, the white 
is for the lowest value, which in this  
176:18 - set is 12. And so it can give you an impression of 
the range of the data. And again, maybe things you  
176:26 - need to focus on, maybe you need to figure out 
what's going on the low days, maybe you need to  
176:30 - figure out what you can do to increase the high 
days. But Conditional Formatting in any of these  
176:35 - situations with the color scale, with highlighting 
a single cell with highlighting an entire row  
176:41 - is a way of using formulas, again, not just 
to manipulate numbers or to manipulate text,  
176:47 - but to manipulate the highlighting and drawing 
attention through additional visual cues. And  
176:53 - it makes it a lot easier to work with your data 
and find the things that you need to make sense.  
176:59 - Congratulations, you've made it to the final 
video in Google Sheets. And you may be wondering  
177:05 - what to do next? Well, I'm here to discuss 
a couple of possible next steps for you.  
177:10 - In learning to work with data and 
learning to work with Google Sheets.  
177:14 - The most important thing is to do it yourself 
gets started and get mixed in with things.  
177:20 - You want to get some data and you just want 
to try see how things work in Google Sheets,  
177:26 - do a little bit experimenting, a little fiddling 
around, see how it behaves and what you can get  
177:31 - out of it to serve your own purposes. Now, what 
you're going to need to do is get some data.  
177:38 - Now chances are you already have some data where 
you work you may have if you're in an organization  
177:45 - that does email marketing, you'll have the names 
and the email addresses and location information,  
177:50 - maybe information about open rates and 
click throughs on your email newsletters,  
177:55 - that's a great place to get data, you can 
download that from your email service provider.  
178:00 - You may have social media data, things like who's 
following you who's commenting where they are,  
178:07 - when they last interacted, what they said and  
178:11 - how they connected and how they share things 
and what they really believed about all of it.  
178:15 - This is information that is also available 
to you through the analytics of your  
178:20 - social media host like if you're using buffer or 
Hootsuite you can get this information and start  
178:26 - putting it into Google Sheets and see what 
you can do. Also, you may have sales data or  
178:31 - some other kind of interaction, you might know 
what kind of items people are buying, or what  
178:36 - services are requesting, whether a first time or 
a repeat customer, and also the path to purchase,  
178:41 - did they click on a thing and Instagram and get 
to Facebook and get to your web page. And that is  
178:47 - a lot of information that can be very helpful 
for businesses and for service organizations  
178:53 - to start better understanding how people are 
interacting with them and how they can reach out.  
178:58 - If you have that data available to you download 
it, see what you can do with it in Google Sheets,  
179:05 - beyond what you can do with the built in analytics 
of each of these programs. Also, you can get free  
179:12 - data. For instance, data.gov is one of the best 
sources of open data in the United States. You  
179:18 - can search for a lot of other different sources. 
Here I'm showing I went to data.gov. And I typed  
179:23 - in the Word Art and looking for data sets on art. 
I have over 11,000 data sets found and you know,  
179:30 - you just click on this little CSV, which stands 
for comma separated values. That'll download  
179:35 - a spreadsheet that you can open up in Google 
Sheets, and you can get started with open data.  
179:41 - You can also get data from Google Trends. And 
that's a service from Google that lets you see  
179:48 - over time, the relative popularity of different 
search terms. Here I've got two German operas  
179:55 - deflator mouse and Rosenkavalier. And you can see 
that for instance, the second one was more popular  
180:02 - back in May of 2017. But the first one has been 
more popular since then, you can download that  
180:07 - data by clicking on this button right here, and 
start seeing what you can do with it in your own  
180:13 - analysis. Finally, there's Google correlate one 
of my favorites services that lets you look at  
180:18 - the popular search terms over time, like we had 
with Google Trends. But it also lets you look at  
180:23 - state by state comparisons, where it gives you 
a number in terms of the actually its standard  
180:29 - deviations of each state in terms of the relative 
popularity of a search term within that state.  
180:34 - One of my favorite ones here is the search for 
modern dance. And you can get that information,  
180:40 - you can download it right here by clicking 
on CSP. And just in case you're wondering,  
180:45 - this state that is head and shoulders above 
every other in the entire United States,  
180:49 - in terms of searches for modern dance, is right 
here in Utah where I live, it's one of the more  
180:54 - shocking things in terms of data driven insights. 
Now, there's other things that you can learn. And  
181:01 - I suggest that if you start here with Google 
Sheets, you might want to try to learn some  
181:06 - more things. So for instance, here at data lab cc 
available either right now or in the near future,  
181:14 - our courses on data principles, I've been showing 
you the tools, and I've been showing you how to  
181:19 - work the tools, but the concepts, what does it 
mean to do a regression, what does it mean to  
181:24 - have a standard deviation, I'm going to talk 
about those things. And these other courses.  
181:29 - I also have sets of courses on the other 
applications within the Google Drive Office  
181:34 - Suite. So that's things like Google docs for 
preparing reports, and Google Slides for making  
181:39 - presentations, Google Forms for gathering new 
data through online surveys. And of course,  
181:45 - there's the Microsoft Office complement of 
all of those Excel, and PowerPoint and word.  
181:53 - In addition to those, if you decide that 
you need more than a spreadsheet can do  
181:57 - easily for you, you might want to try 
statistical software. I suggest jumbo V,  
182:04 - a new and not very well known but immensely 
wonderful application that you can download,  
182:12 - upload your CSV, and start doing high quality 
statistical analyses. It's free, it's open  
182:19 - source is it based on our, but it operates with 
drop down menus that make analysis very easy.  
182:24 - Also, SPSS is a common choice in a lot of 
different fields in nursing and education in the  
182:30 - social sciences. We have courses on SPSS, and if 
that's the one that's most common in your field,  
182:36 - try to get your data into that and see what kind 
of statistical modeling you can do there as well.  
182:41 - And then, of course, if you want to go beyond 
that, you could try statistical programming  
182:45 - in languages like R and Python, we have our first 
course and are currently available, Python will  
182:50 - soon follow. And in any of these, you're going 
to be able to build on what you've done in  
182:55 - Google Sheets, the the insight that you've gone, 
and you'll be able to build on it to get more  
182:59 - statistical modeling, more predictive analytics, 
more ways of finding what you need. And so  
183:05 - it's time to get moving, get some data, get 
going. I'm so grateful that you joined us  
183:12 - here at data lab.cc. I hope this has been an eye 
opening experience and an opportunity for you to  
183:19 - get working with your data to find ways that you 
can run your organization, your business and your  
183:25 - own personal projects more effectively and more 
efficiently. Thanks for joining me and good luck.
