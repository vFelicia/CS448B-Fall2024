02:03 - you can go tell me that on Twitter
02:06 - [Music]
02:10 - Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're at
02:12 - the start of our journey asking the most
02:13 - important question first which is what
02:16 - is the ms-900 Microsoft 365 fundamentals
02:19 - so the Microsoft 365 fundamentals is an
02:22 - entry-level Microsoft certification it
02:24 - has absolutely no prerequisites so you
02:26 - don't need to have any prior cloud or
02:28 - SAS knowledge to learn this specific
02:29 - course the course teaches the cloud
02:31 - fundamentals such as Cloud Concepts
02:33 - types of cloud computing and the
02:35 - benefits of migrating to a cloud
02:37 - environment compared to an on-premises
02:39 - infrastructure the core Microsoft 365
02:41 - services and Concepts we'll be going
02:44 - through the Microsoft 365 solutions that
02:46 - improve productivity facilitate
02:48 - collaboration and optimize
02:50 - Communications such as SharePoint online
02:52 - Microsoft Viva and Microsoft teams we'll
02:55 - cover topics related to the endpoint and
02:57 - deployment options in Microsoft 365 like
03:00 - Microsoft endpoint manager Azure virtual
03:02 - desktop and windows as a service
03:04 - security compliance privacy and Trust in
03:07 - Microsoft 365 like multi-factor
03:10 - education and Defender 365 and we'll
03:13 - cover the Microsoft 365 pricing of
03:16 - subscriptions licenses and support
03:18 - offerings for services here's a simple
03:20 - definition of what Microsoft 365 is so
03:23 - Microsoft 365 formerly Office 365 is the
03:27 - line of subscription services offered by
03:29 - Microsoft which adds to and includes the
03:31 - Microsoft Office product line it's a
03:34 - superset of Office 365 with Windows 10
03:36 - Enterprise licenses and other
03:38 - cloud-based security and device
03:39 - management products so who is this
03:42 - certification for well you should be
03:44 - considering the Microsoft 365
03:46 - fundamental certification if you are new
03:49 - to cloud and want to learn the
03:50 - fundamentals and benefits of adopting
03:52 - cloud services in general and the
03:54 - software as a service Cloud Model
03:55 - specifically you are a business user
03:57 - administrator or IT professional you
04:00 - want to understand the capabilities of
04:01 - Microsoft 365 and how to build basic
04:04 - Solutions and deploy cloud services in
04:06 - your organization you are a senior Cloud
04:08 - engineer or Microsoft 360 C5
04:10 - administrator who needs to reset or
04:12 - refresh their knowledge after working
04:13 - for multiple years so now let's take a
04:16 - look at the Microsoft 365 certification
04:19 - roadmap to see where we would go after
04:20 - the Microsoft 365 fundamentals and what
04:23 - kind of roles would be associated with
04:25 - those certifications so at the start you
04:28 - get your Microsoft 365 fundamentals
04:30 - which is at the fundamental level after
04:32 - that we have the associate level
04:34 - certifications such as the modern
04:36 - desktop administrator teams
04:37 - administrator developer or Security
04:39 - administrator it's really up to you to
04:42 - choose which field you're interested in
04:43 - a common route would be something like
04:45 - taking the modern desktop administrator
04:46 - at the associate level then moving to
04:49 - the Enterprise administrator at the
04:50 - expert level it's also common for people
04:52 - to take multiple of these associate
04:54 - level certifications it doesn't have to
04:56 - be just one this is to ensure they have
04:58 - a wide range of knowledge on all of
05:00 - these areas for possible career openings
05:02 - also if you find the cloud to be really
05:04 - cool and interesting you have options
05:06 - such as Azure administrator and Azure
05:08 - developer from there you you could
05:10 - possibly take the Azure Solutions
05:12 - architect or devops engineer at the
05:14 - expert level so you see there are
05:16 - several options for you to choose from
05:17 - and these are not all the ones on the
05:19 - list once again it's up to you to decide
05:21 - what you want to specialize in and there
05:23 - is no perfect route but these are just a
05:25 - few suggestions for you to decide on
05:27 - your own so how long is it going to take
05:29 - to pass this certification well it's
05:32 - going to really depend on your
05:33 - background but if we had to generalize
05:35 - it we can look at it as kind of a scale
05:37 - and so if you are at the beginner level
05:38 - you're looking at roughly 15 hours and
05:41 - when we say beginner we're saying
05:42 - someone that has never used Microsoft
05:45 - 365 or Office Products like OneDrive
05:47 - teams SharePoint purview Etc someone
05:51 - that has never used Microsoft Azure or
05:53 - any cloud provider or someone that has
05:55 - no Tech background or experience and
05:57 - when we're looking at the other side of
05:59 - the Spectrum which is someone that is
06:00 - experienced we're looking at somebody
06:02 - who can watch this at 1.5 to 2 times
06:04 - speed and are able to absorb this
06:06 - information very quickly so they have
06:08 - practical working experience with
06:10 - Microsoft 365 and is very familiar with
06:13 - using them they have experience with
06:15 - Microsoft Azure or any cloud provider
06:17 - like a WS or gcp so they can easily
06:20 - translate that knowledge or they have a
06:22 - strong background in technology where
06:24 - they've worked in the industry for many
06:25 - years and so you know their study time
06:27 - is going to be a lot shorter at five
06:29 - hours or less and so on average most
06:31 - people are going to take about 10 hours
06:33 - to study for this course and when we
06:35 - talk about the kind of stuff you'll be
06:36 - doing it's going to be 50 lecture in
06:39 - labs and we call them follow-ons where
06:41 - the idea is you follow along in your own
06:43 - account and then 50 is the practice
06:45 - exams so if you look at the length of
06:47 - the content which is around four hours
06:49 - then you know you should spend as much
06:51 - time doing practice exams to pass and
06:53 - the recommended time to study is about
06:55 - one to two hours a day for roughly eight
06:56 - days so what kind of effort are we going
06:59 - to have to put in to pass the exam well
07:01 - you have the watch the lecture videos
07:03 - and memorize key information you'll need
07:05 - to do Hands-On labs and follow along
07:07 - with your own account although as a
07:09 - fundamental certification the
07:11 - certification is not very heavy on hands
07:13 - on material but it will still provide a
07:15 - much greater understanding of the topics
07:17 - you'll need to know for the exam and you
07:19 - will need paid online practice exams
07:20 - that simulate the real exam and the last
07:22 - two here were things that I used to
07:24 - never suggest because you could
07:25 - literally just watch the videos and pass
07:27 - however Microsoft has recently updated
07:29 - this exam so it's more difficult and so
07:32 - for these last two points you do have to
07:34 - do these two things for the paid online
07:36 - practice exams that can be hard for some
07:38 - people so I've made it easier for you by
07:40 - providing you with a full free practice
07:42 - exam on exampro.co ms-900 and so you
07:46 - just have to sign up with no credit card
07:48 - required and you'll get a full set of
07:50 - questions that simulate the real exam so
07:52 - for the contents of the exam it is
07:55 - composed of four domains and each domain
07:57 - has its own weighting which determines
07:58 - how many questions in a domain that will
08:00 - appear so for domain one which is cloud
08:03 - Concepts we're looking at 10 to 15
08:05 - percent for domain two core Microsoft
08:07 - 365 services and concept tips we should
08:10 - expect 50 to 55 percent of the questions
08:13 - from there this is where the most amount
08:15 - of questions are from for domain three
08:17 - security compliance privacy and Trust in
08:20 - Microsoft 365 we're sitting at around 15
08:23 - to 20 percent of the questions and for
08:25 - domain four Microsoft 365 pricing and
08:28 - support we have roughly 10 to 15 percent
08:30 - of the questions so just to emphasize
08:32 - for domain two you will need to know a
08:34 - wide range of the core Microsoft 365
08:37 - services but you also need to know in
08:39 - depth about the core services so where
08:41 - do you take the exam well at an
08:43 - in-person test center or online from the
08:45 - convenience of your own home Microsoft
08:47 - has partnered with the test center
08:49 - Network Pearson View and it offers in
08:51 - person or online and these exams are
08:53 - proctored meaning there is somebody
08:54 - watching you to ensure that you are not
08:56 - cheating in order to pass the exam you
08:59 - have to score 700 points out of a
09:00 - thousand and so 700 generally equates to
09:03 - 70 percent but it's around 70 percent
09:05 - because Microsoft uses scaled soaring
09:07 - meaning that they could adjust it based
09:09 - on how many people are passing or
09:10 - failing so always aim to get higher than
09:13 - 70 percent the exam contains 43 to 50
09:16 - questions so you can afford to get
09:18 - roughly 10 to 12 questions wrong there
09:20 - is no penalty for wrong questions like
09:22 - minus one so you should always choose an
09:24 - answer and the questions come in a few
09:26 - formats multiple choice multiple answer
09:28 - drag and drop and yes or no questions
09:31 - the duration of the exam is one hour or
09:33 - 60 minutes so you have a little more
09:35 - than one minute per question the exam
09:37 - time is 60 minutes but the seat time is
09:40 - 90 minutes see time refers to the amount
09:42 - of time to review instructions Show
09:44 - online Proctor your workspace read and
09:46 - accept NDA and complete the exam and
09:49 - provide feedback and when you do pass
09:51 - the exam the exam is valid forever
09:53 - Microsoft's fundamental level exams do
09:55 - not expire and you do not need to do a
09:57 - recertification so that about covers the
10:00 - introduction of the course
10:01 - foreign
10:05 - [Music]
10:10 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
10:12 - and we'll be going through an exam guide
10:14 - breakdown of the Microsoft 365
10:16 - fundamental certification so the first
10:18 - thing you want to do is to go to this
10:20 - link here
10:21 - docs.microsoft.com and dash us slash
10:25 - certifications slash exams slash ms-900
10:29 - and once you're here you want to
10:31 - navigate to this link called Ms 900
10:33 - study guide this will open a neatly
10:35 - organized study guide that Microsoft has
10:37 - prepared for us for the Microsoft 365
10:39 - fundamentals exam we've already covered
10:41 - a general overview on what the exam is
10:43 - who the exam is for and a brief overview
10:45 - on the topics but we'll need to cover
10:47 - the exam breakdown in more detail this
10:49 - is the section we're looking for the
10:51 - objective domain skills the exam
10:53 - measures so we already covered the four
10:55 - main domains describe Cloud Concepts
10:58 - describe core Microsoft 365 services and
11:01 - concepts with the emphasis of 50 to 55
11:03 - percent describe security compliance
11:06 - privacy and Trust in Microsoft 365 disc
11:09 - Microsoft 365 pricing and support I
11:13 - won't be going through the entire list
11:14 - because it's quite long but I'll point
11:16 - out the ones I know for sure will be on
11:18 - the exam starting with Microsoft SAS iOS
11:21 - and pass offerings the differences
11:23 - between Office 365 Microsoft 365 and
11:27 - Windows 365 you'll need to know public
11:29 - private and hybrid scenarios and compare
11:32 - advantages of cloud-based Services
11:34 - versus on-premises services for the core
11:36 - Microsoft 365 services and Concepts
11:39 - you'll definitely need to know all of
11:41 - these Services listed you'll need to
11:43 - know a brief description of what it is
11:45 - when it's used for some of its key
11:46 - features how does it improve
11:48 - productivity or collaboration
11:50 - Etc I'll just point out the ones I saw
11:52 - mentioned a lot on the exam so Microsoft
11:54 - Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Microsoft
11:57 - 365 apps in OneDrive Microsoft teams
12:01 - SharePoint the ever and Microsoft Viva
12:03 - there will definitely be some questions
12:05 - on Microsoft endpoint manager Windows
12:07 - 365 Cloud PC and Azure virtual desktop
12:11 - deployment and release models for
12:13 - Windows as a service including
12:14 - deployment Rings Viva insights and
12:16 - you'll definitely see Microsoft 365
12:19 - admin Center and Microsoft 365 user
12:22 - portal for the security compliance
12:24 - privacy and Trust in Microsoft 365
12:27 - section you'll definitely see principle
12:29 - of least privileged access identity and
12:32 - access management capabilities in
12:33 - Microsoft 365 including Azure active
12:36 - directory and Azure identity
12:38 - multi-factor authentication conditional
12:40 - access Microsoft 365 Defender Defender
12:43 - for endpoint Defender for Office 365
12:46 - Defender for identity and the Microsoft
12:49 - Defender portal Microsoft secure score
12:51 - Azure Sentinel service trust portal and
12:54 - compliance manager DLP compliance scores
12:57 - and you'll see a bit of auditing and
12:58 - e-discovery solutions for the Microsoft
13:01 - 365 pricing and support domain pricing
13:04 - model for Microsoft cloud services
13:05 - including Enterprise agreements Cloud
13:08 - solution providers Direct filling
13:10 - available base licensing and management
13:12 - options there were definitely some
13:14 - questions on private public preview and
13:16 - general availability options Microsoft
13:19 - 365 roadmap portal you'll need to know
13:21 - how to create a support request for
13:23 - Microsoft 365 services and you'll need
13:26 - to know the service level agreements
13:27 - once again there's a lot on the list so
13:30 - I couldn't name all of them so name the
13:31 - ones I thought were the most important
13:33 - but throughout the course we'll
13:35 - definitely cover all of the material in
13:36 - great detail
13:38 - foreign
13:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
13:44 - and we're starting at the beginning of
13:46 - our journey asking the most fundamental
13:48 - question what is cloud computing so
13:50 - looking into the dictionary cloud
13:52 - computing is described as the practice
13:53 - of using a network of remote servers
13:55 - hosted on the internet to store manage
13:57 - and process data rather than a local
13:59 - server or a personal computer so when
14:01 - we're talking about local we describe
14:03 - this as being on premise so being your
14:05 - own office or your own Data Center and
14:07 - this is where you own the servers you
14:08 - hire the IT people you pay the rent or
14:10 - the real estate you take all the risk
14:12 - whereas with a cloud provider if you're
14:14 - utilizing them it's someone else who
14:16 - owns the servers someone else who hires
14:18 - the IT people someone else who pays or
14:20 - rents the real estate and you are only
14:22 - left would be responsible for
14:23 - configuring your cloud services and code
14:25 - and someone else takes care of the rest
14:26 - sounds great doesn't it so now what I
14:29 - want to do is just give you a quick
14:30 - overview of how servers have evolved
14:32 - what we describe is cloud computing from
14:34 - a technical perspective and we'll
14:36 - probably dive deeper into this later in
14:38 - the course but we're just going to get a
14:39 - good overview here to understand from a
14:41 - business perspective so way back in the
14:43 - day what we had was dedicated servers if
14:45 - you wanted a server to run your web app
14:47 - or your technology what you had to do is
14:49 - you had to go buy a single dedicated
14:50 - physical machine and that was for one
14:53 - specific business dedicated servers are
14:55 - still used today but there's some
14:56 - downsides with them they're very
14:58 - expensive they're high maintenance
15:00 - however you do get a great level of
15:02 - customization and you potentially can
15:03 - have better Security based on your use
15:05 - case then what came along was virtual
15:07 - private servers where we still had one
15:09 - physical machine but it was still
15:10 - dedicated to a single business so we
15:12 - figured out how to take that physical
15:13 - machine and virtualize it into sub
15:15 - machines so now we can fully utilize or
15:17 - better utilize that physical server with
15:19 - running multiple apps we didn't have to
15:21 - buy four different servers for four
15:23 - different apps we could easily run four
15:25 - web apps into four virtual sub machines
15:27 - then we had shared hosting and this made
15:29 - it a lot easier for anybody who was
15:30 - building websites or wordpresses but the
15:33 - idea here is that you had one physical
15:34 - machine and it was shared by hundreds of
15:36 - businesses so it wasn't a single
15:38 - business sharing the cost it was
15:39 - multiple businesses this relies on most
15:42 - tenants on under utilizing the resources
15:43 - though so if you had 100 people on a
15:46 - server and one person use more of the
15:47 - server than the others then you could
15:49 - all potentially suffer from that case
15:50 - but at the very least you are getting
15:52 - very very cheap servers but there are
15:54 - definitely some limitations so now
15:56 - coming down to Cloud hosting Cloud
15:58 - hosting gives us the best of both worlds
16:00 - so we have multiple physical machines
16:01 - that act as one system which could be
16:04 - described as the cloud and that system
16:06 - is extracted away into multiple cloud
16:07 - services so you get flexibility and
16:10 - scalability it's very secure it's very
16:12 - cost effective and it's highly
16:13 - configurable so that is where we're
16:15 - currently at and that is generally what
16:17 - cloud computing and Cloud hosting is
16:19 - about
16:20 - foreign
16:24 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
16:26 - and we are looking at common cloud
16:28 - services so a cloud provider can have
16:30 - hundreds of cloud services that are
16:32 - grouped into various types of services
16:33 - and the four most common types of cloud
16:35 - services for infrastructure as a service
16:37 - which is a topic we will discuss about
16:39 - later would be compute so this is where
16:42 - you have a virtual computer that can run
16:44 - applications programs and code then you
16:46 - have storage so this is where you would
16:48 - have a virtual hard drive that you could
16:50 - store files then you in a virtual
16:52 - networking because you have these
16:53 - computers in storage so you need to put
16:55 - them in some kind of virtual Network to
16:57 - Define internet connections or network
16:58 - isolations and then you have databases
17:01 - so just imagine a database that is
17:03 - running in the cloud or if you're not
17:05 - familiar databases just imagine that
17:07 - it's excel in the cloud but it Powers
17:09 - your web apps one thing I want you to
17:11 - know about the term cloud computing is
17:12 - that even though it says Computing in
17:14 - the word at this point we just use it as
17:16 - a catch-all term so it could refer to
17:18 - all of these categories so when I say
17:20 - cloud computing it could be referring to
17:22 - compute network storage and data
17:24 - database but you can also say cloud
17:26 - storage Cloud compute Cloud databases
17:28 - Cloud networking and people will know
17:30 - what you mean
17:31 - [Music]
17:36 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
17:38 - we are looking at what is Microsoft so
17:40 - you've probably seen this logo before
17:41 - and Microsoft is an American
17:43 - multinational computer technology
17:45 - corporation headquartered in Redmond
17:47 - Washington Microsoft makes software
17:49 - phones tablets game consoles cloud
17:52 - services which is what we care about
17:54 - here today and they even have a search
17:56 - engine and we're not just limited to
17:57 - that list they have tons of stuff but
18:00 - Microsoft is best known for their
18:01 - operating system called a Windows and
18:03 - they've been around since the 1970s so
18:06 - they've been around for quite a while in
18:07 - the tech sphere so now that leads us to
18:09 - the question what is azure so Azure is
18:12 - what Microsoft calls their cloud service
18:13 - provider and so it's called Microsoft
18:15 - Azure where we commonly refer to it as
18:17 - just Azure so here is the logo for it
18:19 - and if you're wondering what is the name
18:21 - behind the service Azure literally means
18:23 - bright blue color of the cloudless sky
18:25 - so that's great you'll hear me say cloud
18:27 - service provider frequently throughout
18:29 - the cloud Concepts portion of the course
18:30 - and it is abbreviated to CSP but that's
18:33 - what Azure is it is a cloud service
18:35 - provider so there you go
18:37 - [Music]
18:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
18:43 - and we are looking at the benefits of
18:45 - cloud computing so what are the benefits
18:47 - well we have a big list here for you
18:49 - starting with cost Effectiveness so you
18:51 - pay for what you consume there are no
18:53 - upfront costs you have pay as you go
18:55 - also abbreviated as poig and you're
18:57 - sharing the cost with thousands of
18:58 - customers so that's how you're getting
19:00 - that low cost another benefit is that
19:02 - you can go Global so you can launch
19:04 - workloads anywhere in the world just
19:06 - choose your own region and you are now
19:07 - in the global market another benefit is
19:09 - that the cloud is secure because the
19:11 - cloud providers take care of the
19:13 - physical security and cloud services can
19:15 - be secure by default or you have the
19:17 - ability to configure access down to the
19:18 - granular level so you have a lot of
19:20 - security controls that you would have
19:22 - and you would normally not have where
19:24 - you'd have to build out on premises now
19:26 - the cloud is also known for being
19:27 - reliable so you can have data backups
19:30 - disaster recovery and data replication
19:32 - and fault tolerance the cloud is also
19:34 - scalable you can increase or decrease
19:36 - your resources and services based on the
19:38 - demand the cloud is also elastic so so
19:41 - you can automate scaling during spikes
19:43 - and drops of the demand when there is no
19:44 - longer the demand for that stuff and
19:46 - finally it's also current so the
19:48 - underlying hardware and managed software
19:50 - is patched upgraded and replaced by the
19:52 - cloud provider without interruption to
19:54 - you and for the last point there are
19:56 - cases of interruption but generally
19:58 - fewer interruptions than you would have
20:00 - on premises so there you go
20:02 - [Music]
20:06 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
20:08 - and we are looking at the different
20:09 - types of cloud computing and we have
20:11 - this nice pyramid on left hand side to
20:13 - help us understand how each type builds
20:15 - off the other starting at the top of our
20:17 - pyramid we have software as a service
20:19 - also known as SAS and this is a product
20:21 - that is run and managed by the service
20:23 - provider you don't have to worry about
20:25 - how the service is maintained and it
20:26 - just works and remains available so you
20:28 - might not be aware of this but you
20:30 - probably already are using a SAS product
20:32 - so examples of that could be Salesforce
20:34 - or Gmail or Office 365 so those are
20:37 - things that would be considered SAS and
20:39 - these are really for customers so it's
20:41 - just you wanting to use General software
20:43 - on your computer but in the cloud the
20:45 - next category we have is platform as a
20:47 - service abbreviated as pass and so here
20:49 - we focus on the development and
20:50 - management of your applications so you
20:52 - don't have to worry about provisioning
20:54 - configuring or understanding the
20:56 - hardware or operating system and this is
20:58 - really for people that are building apps
21:00 - but they don't think about any of the
21:01 - infrastructure services like this would
21:03 - be elastic Beanstalk on a WS Heroku that
21:06 - is very popular amongst Junior
21:07 - developers which is a third party
21:09 - service for launching web apps and then
21:11 - you have the Google app engine so those
21:13 - are three examples there and these are
21:15 - really for developers so platform as a
21:17 - service makes it easy for developers to
21:19 - build apps on the cloud without worrying
21:21 - about all the stuff underneath at the
21:23 - bottom finally we have infrastructure as
21:25 - a service abbreviated as is and this is
21:27 - the basic building blocks for cloud it
21:29 - so it provides access to networking
21:31 - features computers and data storage
21:34 - space you don't worry about the IT staff
21:36 - data centers and hardware and so
21:38 - examples of infrastructure as a service
21:40 - would be Microsoft Azure AWS or even
21:43 - Oracle cloud and so this is really
21:45 - intended for administrators the main
21:47 - focus of the course will be on Microsoft
21:49 - 365 which falls under the category of
21:52 - software as a service but you will
21:54 - definitely need to understand the
21:55 - differences of the cloud computing types
21:57 - for the exam so that is the three types
21:59 - of cloud computing okay
22:01 - [Music]
22:04 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
22:07 - and we're looking at the types of cloud
22:08 - computing and responsibilities so we saw
22:11 - the three categories but we don't really
22:13 - understand what it is that we're
22:14 - responsible for and what is the cloud
22:16 - service provider responsible for so
22:18 - let's lay out our categories and we're
22:20 - going to include on-premises into this
22:21 - because technically on premises could be
22:23 - a private cloud and should be in the
22:25 - category here so we have on premises
22:27 - infrastructure as a service platform as
22:29 - a service and software as a service so
22:31 - when we're looking at applications it's
22:33 - going to be the customer's
22:34 - responsibility for on-prem
22:36 - infrastructure as a service and pass but
22:38 - when we have software as a service the
22:40 - cloud service provider is responsible
22:42 - for that when we are looking at the data
22:44 - level it's going to be the same for
22:46 - software as a service the cloud service
22:48 - provider is going to be responsible but
22:50 - for the rest it's going to be the
22:51 - customer and then on the next level for
22:53 - the runtime the cloud service provider
22:55 - will be responsible for the platform as
22:57 - a service and software as a service the
22:59 - customer will be responsible for
23:00 - on-premises and infrastructure as a
23:02 - service for middleware it's going to be
23:04 - the same game for the OS like the
23:06 - operating system that is running on the
23:07 - service it's going to be the same then
23:10 - we get to virtualization the cloud
23:12 - service provider is responsible for the
23:13 - virtualization for infrastructure as a
23:15 - service platform as a service and
23:18 - software is a service so everything
23:19 - except for on-prem then for servers it's
23:22 - the same for storage it's the same and
23:25 - for networking it's also the same so you
23:27 - can see that on premises you're
23:29 - responsible for everything and the
23:31 - farther we move up the types of cloud
23:32 - computing the less responsibility you
23:34 - have
23:35 - [Music]
23:39 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
23:41 - and we are looking at azure's deployment
23:43 - models the first model we're going to
23:45 - talk about is public cloud and that's
23:47 - where everything is built on the cloud
23:48 - service provider you're not using
23:50 - anything on-prem or in your own data
23:52 - centers everything is running within
23:53 - Azure generally this is known as Cloud
23:55 - native that for some reason Azure calls
23:58 - it the public Cloud so that's what we're
24:00 - going to use in the terminology here so
24:02 - here I have an architectural diagram we
24:04 - have a network on Azure and within that
24:06 - Network we have a virtual machine
24:07 - running in a database running so that
24:09 - would be an example of public Cloud then
24:12 - we have private cloud and so this is
24:13 - where everything is built on the
24:15 - company's data also known as on premises
24:17 - because it's within the premises of the
24:19 - organization like their physical
24:20 - location and an organization could
24:22 - technically be operating their own cloud
24:24 - but it would be private cloud and it
24:26 - could be running an open source Cloud
24:27 - software that mimics what Azure would do
24:29 - such as openstack so it looks very
24:31 - similar but you just put an openstack
24:33 - and it's running a virtual machine or a
24:35 - server and it's also running a database
24:37 - and the last on our list here is how
24:39 - hybrid so with hybrid you are using both
24:41 - on-premises and the cloud service
24:43 - provider and they're connected together
24:44 - and so there's a lot of different
24:46 - networking services that you can use
24:47 - that will facilitate the connection
24:49 - between the two in this case we're using
24:51 - express route express route is a
24:53 - dedicated connection it's like having a
24:55 - fiber optic Line running from your
24:57 - on-premises data center to the Azure
24:58 - Network so it's just one of the ways you
25:00 - can connect and if we wanted to
25:02 - understand the pros and cons I have this
25:04 - nice little table here and we'll just
25:06 - quickly go through it so if you're using
25:08 - public Cloud it's more cost effective
25:10 - for security its screen controls are
25:12 - stronger by default but some people
25:14 - might not find the cloud will meet all
25:16 - their security requirements because of
25:17 - government and Regulatory reasons not
25:19 - because the cloud is not secure but it's
25:21 - just those policies for the level of
25:23 - configuration it's going to be limited
25:25 - based on what the cloud service provider
25:27 - exposes to you so there's a lot of
25:29 - configuration there it's just that if
25:31 - you have your own servers you obviously
25:33 - can do anything and everything with them
25:34 - for technical knowledge you don't need
25:36 - to have as much in-depth knowledge of
25:37 - the underlying infrastructure because as
25:39 - you're not physically setting up servers
25:41 - or networking and everything else now
25:43 - coming down to private Cloud private
25:45 - cloud is the most expensive option on
25:47 - our list so you're going to be paying a
25:49 - lot of money for security there is no
25:51 - guarantee that it is a hundred percent
25:52 - secure because you just don't have the
25:54 - same kind of visibility that you would
25:55 - have with a cloud service provider with
25:57 - all those dashboards it's just so hard
25:59 - to build out all that software but you
26:01 - can meet your security compliance
26:02 - requirements depending on your situation
26:04 - but this is becoming less and less is
26:06 - more governments and larger
26:07 - organizations move over to the cloud you
26:09 - can configure infrastructure exactly how
26:11 - you like because you literally bought
26:13 - the hardware and can do anything you
26:14 - want with it and for the technical
26:16 - knowledge you'll require a serious
26:18 - amount of technical knowledge you might
26:20 - even have a really hard time finding the
26:21 - resources to maintain all that stuff
26:23 - down below we have the hybrid model so
26:25 - this could be more cost effective based
26:27 - on what you offload to the cloud and
26:29 - also the cost of actually moving data
26:31 - back and forth for security you have
26:33 - more to secure but technically some
26:35 - things are easier to secure on the cloud
26:36 - than it is in private so you might have
26:38 - a boost security you're going to get the
26:40 - best of both worlds in terms of
26:42 - configuration and for technical
26:44 - knowledge you're going to need to know
26:45 - both the cloud and how to set things up
26:47 - on premises and that's the most work
26:49 - there and just one more deployment model
26:51 - here I just wanted to briefly touch on
26:53 - Cross Cloud this isn't something that is
26:55 - listed on the actual exam but it's
26:57 - something that you should understand and
26:58 - know and so cross cloud is when you're
27:00 - using multiple Cloud providers some
27:02 - people refer this as multi-cloud or
27:04 - hybrid cloud and so I just have an
27:06 - example here so there's a service called
27:08 - Azure Arc and what Azure Arc does that
27:10 - extends your control plane so you can
27:12 - run containers kubernetes containers on
27:14 - a different platforms and so you could
27:16 - have a WS on the left hand side with eks
27:18 - and gcp kubernetes engine and so you can
27:21 - be running virtual machines and they're
27:23 - all treated like they're on the same
27:24 - network so cross cloud is becoming very
27:26 - popular with extremely large
27:28 - organizations where they have very
27:29 - unique requirements but I definitely
27:31 - want you to know what that is because it
27:33 - just gets left out and it's definitely
27:35 - something that is a part of the industry
27:37 - [Music]
27:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
27:43 - and we're looking at the concept of
27:45 - total cost of ownership also known as
27:47 - TCO so what is the difference between
27:49 - on-premises having your own data centers
27:52 - in comparison with using Azure so you'll
27:54 - notice above it it says capex and Opex
27:56 - we're going to talk about that in the
27:58 - next slide but for the time being we're
28:00 - going to focus on the total cost of
28:02 - ownership so to really make sense of TCO
28:04 - I always use this graphic here and if
28:07 - you're wondering what that is those are
28:08 - icebergs people sometimes think they
28:10 - look like teeth and so just to make this
28:12 - dry a little bit more clear I've added
28:14 - some penguins and a whale so there's no
28:16 - mistaking it and the reason we're using
28:18 - this as a representation is because we
28:19 - have the top of the iceberg which are
28:21 - the costs that we're generally concerned
28:23 - about but then we have those hidden
28:24 - costs those costs that we're not really
28:26 - thinking about underneath the water and
28:28 - if you know icebergs they can be really
28:30 - big underneath so on the left hand side
28:32 - the cost that we generally think of is
28:34 - the software license fees and then for
28:36 - the cloud service provider we look at
28:38 - the subscription fees and so when you're
28:40 - comparing these two sometimes the
28:42 - subscription fees can cost more than the
28:43 - software license fee so you think well
28:46 - we should really just use on-premises
28:47 - because it's more cost effective but
28:49 - when we take in the total cost of
28:51 - ownership and all the costs involved
28:52 - we're going to see a very different
28:54 - picture so on the left hand side if you
28:56 - are on premises you have to deal with
28:58 - the implementation the configuration and
29:00 - the training but you also have to deal
29:02 - with the physical security of your
29:04 - building you have to pay for the
29:05 - hardware you have to pay for the IT
29:07 - personnel you also have to deal with
29:09 - maintenance now on the right hand side
29:11 - on the cloud you still have to do
29:13 - implementation configuration and
29:15 - training but that's about it so there's
29:17 - a big difference in terms of what you
29:18 - have to do and you might ask okay well
29:21 - what is the amount of savings well
29:23 - generally people find that when they
29:24 - move from on-premises to the cloud they
29:26 - save about 75 percent that's a lot of
29:29 - money okay 75 percent of what you
29:31 - generally would spend and so now all
29:33 - this stuff on the left hand side is now
29:35 - azure's responsibility you don't take
29:37 - care of those anymore Azure is going to
29:39 - take care of it for you so that's total
29:40 - cost of of ownership
29:42 - [Music]
29:46 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
29:48 - and we're looking at Capital versus
29:49 - operational expenditure so on the left
29:52 - hand side we have capex so Capital
29:54 - expenditures on the right hand side we
29:56 - have operational expenditures Opex and
29:59 - so looking at the left hand side capital
30:01 - expenditure is spending money up front
30:03 - on physical infrastructure so deducting
30:05 - the expenses from your tax bill over
30:07 - time a lot of companies especially
30:09 - larger companies are used to dealing
30:11 - with capital expenses and they know how
30:13 - to work their tax bill so that's why a
30:15 - lot of people are afraid to move over to
30:16 - the cloud because they're used to this
30:18 - way of operating but let's talk about
30:19 - some of the things that would be
30:21 - considered a capital expense so again
30:23 - it's anything that's physical and then
30:25 - you're buying it with money up front so
30:26 - computers that would be your server cost
30:28 - if you were to buy hard drives it'd be
30:31 - your storage costs if you bought routers
30:33 - cables or switches for your network if
30:35 - you're purchasing things for backup and
30:37 - archive costs if you had disaster
30:38 - recovery so like an uninterruptible
30:40 - power supply would be an example of that
30:42 - you have your data center costs so
30:44 - that's your rent cooling physical
30:46 - security you have technical Personnel so
30:48 - you're hiring people to do things for
30:50 - you and so with capital expenses you
30:52 - have to guess up for what you plan to
30:54 - spend now let's look at operational
30:55 - expenditure so operational expenditure
30:58 - is the cost Associated when an
30:59 - on-premises data has shifted that cost
31:01 - to the service provider so here in this
31:03 - case it's the cloud service provider and
31:05 - the customer only has to be concerned
31:07 - with non-physical costs so what are some
31:09 - examples of Opex costs well leasing
31:11 - software and customizing features
31:13 - training employees and cloud services
31:15 - paying for cloud support billing based
31:17 - on the cloud metrics so compute usage
31:19 - and storage usage and the advantage here
31:21 - is that operational expenses you can try
31:24 - a product or service without investing
31:26 - equipment so we have flexibility of
31:28 - investment and also from the previous
31:29 - slide covering total cost of the
31:31 - ownership we saw that we have a huge
31:33 - reduction cost so those are two really
31:35 - good reasons to use the cloud
31:37 - [Music]
31:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
31:43 - and we are looking at Cloud architecture
31:45 - terminologies and these are very
31:47 - important to help you conceptualize the
31:49 - advantages of the cloud so we're going
31:51 - to go through these terms and then we're
31:52 - going to go through them again in more
31:54 - detail in further slides so at the top
31:56 - of our list we have availability and
31:58 - this is your ability to ensure a service
31:59 - remains available this is generally
32:01 - known as being highly available or high
32:03 - availability abbreviated to hot that's a
32:06 - term you should know then we have
32:07 - scalability so your ability to grow
32:09 - rapidly or unimpeded then you have
32:11 - elasticity so this is your ability to
32:13 - shrink or grow to meet the demand you
32:15 - have fault tolerance this is your
32:17 - ability to prevent a failure then you
32:19 - have Disaster Recovery this is your
32:21 - ability to recover from a failure this
32:23 - is generally known as being highly
32:24 - durable or high durability so there you
32:26 - go
32:27 - [Music]
32:31 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
32:33 - and we are looking at the concept of
32:35 - high availability so high availability
32:37 - is the ability for your service to
32:39 - remain available by ensuring there is no
32:41 - single point of failure and or to ensure
32:43 - a certain level of performance so here I
32:45 - have a technical architectural diagram
32:47 - that is describing High availability so
32:49 - the idea behind this is that if you have
32:51 - a server which runs your web application
32:53 - if you were to run redundant versions of
32:55 - your server if anything happened to a
32:57 - single server traffic would always be
32:58 - routed to those other servers and that
33:00 - would allow your service to remain
33:02 - available now having multiple servers is
33:04 - great but what's even better is having
33:06 - multiple servers in multiple data
33:08 - centers because something could happen
33:09 - to a data center it could become
33:11 - unavailable because of the networking
33:12 - issue so by being able to Route traffic
33:14 - to those servers you're going to remain
33:16 - highly available running a workload
33:18 - across multiple availability zones and
33:20 - availability zones is what Azure calls
33:22 - their data centers and shares that if
33:24 - one or two data center becomes
33:25 - unavailable your service will remain
33:27 - available it's very very common to run
33:30 - at least three servers across three data
33:32 - centers now how would you distribute the
33:34 - traffic or manage the traffic to all
33:35 - three well that's where an Azure load
33:37 - balancer comes into play represented as
33:39 - a green diamond with the arrows that is
33:41 - the representation of a load balancer so
33:43 - a load balancer allows you to evenly
33:45 - distribute traffic to multiple servers
33:47 - in one or more data centers and if a
33:49 - data center or server becomes
33:50 - unavailable so in healthy the load
33:52 - balancer will route the traffic to only
33:54 - available data centers with servers so
33:56 - there you go that is high availability
33:59 - [Music]
34:03 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
34:05 - and we're looking at the concept of high
34:07 - scalability and this is your ability to
34:09 - increase your capacity based on the
34:11 - increasing demand of traffic memory and
34:13 - computing power if you are a growing
34:15 - company you're going to have to scale up
34:17 - you're going to have to get bigger and
34:18 - better servers but there are different
34:20 - types of scaling so the first type of
34:22 - scaling is vertical scaling this is the
34:25 - most obvious one people are going to
34:26 - think of and it's called scaling up what
34:28 - we do is we just upgrade to bigger
34:30 - servers we need bigger stronger and
34:32 - faster computers for instance if your
34:34 - server requires more processing power
34:36 - vertical scaling would mean upgrading
34:38 - the CPUs you can also vertically scale
34:41 - the memory storage or network speed
34:43 - there's another kind of scaling called
34:45 - horizontal scaling and horizontal
34:46 - scaling is described as scaling out what
34:49 - you're doing is you're just adding
34:50 - additional servers because we saw with
34:51 - the high availability we have a load
34:54 - balancer we can distribute traffic to
34:56 - multiple servers and three servers can
34:57 - equal the same thing as one big server
34:59 - so horizontal scaling is when we add
35:01 - more servers of the same size for
35:03 - example if you are hosting an
35:05 - application on a server and find that it
35:07 - no longer has the capacity or
35:08 - capabilities to handle traffic adding a
35:11 - server may be your solution
35:12 - [Music]
35:16 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
35:18 - and we're looking at the concept of high
35:20 - elasticity and this is your ability to
35:23 - automatically increase or decrease Your
35:24 - Capacity based on the current demand of
35:26 - traffic memory and computing power so
35:29 - this sounds a lot like high scalability
35:31 - but the key difference is that it's
35:32 - automatic and you can decrease the
35:34 - demand not just increase it so the way
35:37 - we would do that is that we would have a
35:38 - virtual machine or server and if we
35:40 - needed more servers we would add more
35:42 - servers and if we needed less servers we
35:44 - would remove servers or servers that are
35:46 - not being used and so this is going to
35:48 - be accomplished using horizontal scaling
35:50 - so when we say we're scaling out this
35:52 - means we're adding more servers of the
35:53 - same size when we're scaling in this
35:56 - means we're removing servers of the same
35:57 - size generally you're not going to use
35:59 - vertical scaling for a high elasticity
36:01 - this is because it's just extremely
36:03 - difficult to vertically scale for
36:05 - example if you have to increase your
36:07 - storage drive and then you decrease it
36:09 - you could potentially lose data so it's
36:11 - not a good idea or even feasible to do
36:13 - vertical scaling with high elasticity
36:14 - now how would you accomplish a list City
36:17 - on Azure well you'd use azure's VM scale
36:19 - set so scale sets automatically increase
36:21 - or decrease in the response to demand or
36:24 - based on a defined schedule and then we
36:26 - have SQL Server stretch database these
36:28 - dynamically stretch warm and cold
36:30 - transactional data from Microsoft SQL
36:32 - Server 2016 to a Microsoft Azure it's
36:35 - not something that we're going to cover
36:36 - but it's generally the same concept of
36:38 - what scale sets do so there you go
36:40 - that's high elasticity
36:42 - [Music]
36:46 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
36:48 - and we're looking at the concept of
36:50 - being highly fault tolerant and this is
36:52 - the ability for your service to ensure
36:53 - there is no single point of failure
36:55 - preventing the chance of failure so when
36:58 - we looked at high availability we also
37:00 - said that there was no point of failure
37:01 - but when we really talk about that we're
37:03 - really talking about being highly fault
37:05 - tolerant because there's the word
37:06 - failure in the word and that is what
37:08 - being fault tolerant is so how do we
37:10 - prevent failure well we use the concept
37:13 - of failovers so failovers is when you
37:15 - have a plan to shift traffic to a
37:17 - redundant system in case a primary
37:18 - system fails and so I have a Graphic
37:20 - here that represents a primary database
37:22 - failing over to a secondary database so
37:25 - the idea is that we have a copy of our
37:27 - production database and we're going to
37:28 - call that a secondary system and every
37:30 - time something is written to our primary
37:32 - database it's going to be synced so it's
37:34 - going to be sent over to our secondary
37:36 - database so it's up to date with the
37:38 - latest database and then if the primary
37:40 - database happens to fail for whatever
37:42 - reason whether it's Hardware or
37:43 - otherwise it's going to detect that
37:45 - there's something wrong with the prime
37:46 - primary database and it's going to fail
37:48 - over to the secondary database and the
37:51 - secondary database is going to be
37:52 - promoted to being the primary Database
37:54 - The key thing to understand is that the
37:56 - secondary database is on standby it's
37:58 - not in actual use it's only in use when
38:00 - the failover occurs so what would you
38:02 - use in Azure to build out a highly fault
38:04 - tolerance system that's where Azure
38:06 - traffic manager comes into play so this
38:08 - works at the DNS level the idea here is
38:10 - that you can fail over from a primary
38:12 - system at the DNS level to a standby
38:14 - secondary system this is really great if
38:16 - you have Regional failures you could
38:18 - probably also use a load balancer but
38:20 - this is the case that I'm showing here
38:22 - so there you go
38:23 - [Music]
38:27 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
38:29 - and we are looking at the concept of
38:31 - high durability so this is your ability
38:33 - to recover from a disaster and to
38:35 - prevent the loss of data so solutions
38:37 - that recover from a disaster is known as
38:39 - Disaster Recovery Dr you can think of
38:41 - durability as a measurement of how
38:43 - healthy and resilient your data is you
38:45 - want your data to be as safe and secure
38:46 - when you retrieve it as it was on the
38:48 - day you stored it so I'm just going to
38:50 - ask you a few questions to help you
38:51 - think about how to be highly durable so
38:53 - one question would be do you have a
38:55 - backup in place how fast can you restore
38:57 - your backup does your backup still work
38:59 - how do you ensure a current live data is
39:01 - not corrupt data loss can happen through
39:04 - human accident natural or man-made
39:06 - disaster or even malicious action out of
39:08 - your control whether you store data in
39:10 - your home office or with a cloud
39:11 - provider that data needs to be protected
39:13 - as much as possible for many event that
39:15 - could damage or destroy it you need to
39:17 - ensure that you have the questions
39:18 - listed to be answered with an
39:20 - appropriate solution to ensure high
39:21 - durability there are a variety of
39:23 - services to implement high durability so
39:25 - it's not just a single service so that
39:28 - is the concept of high durability and
39:30 - that is the full list of cloud
39:31 - architecture terminology
39:33 - [Music]
39:38 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
39:40 - so before we talk about Microsoft 365
39:42 - let's talk about the evolution from
39:44 - Office 365 to Microsoft 365. so Office
39:48 - 365 was designed to bring together its
39:51 - existing online products to a
39:52 - continually up-to-date cloud service it
39:54 - combined the core productivity apps such
39:56 - as word excel PowerPoint Outlook Etc and
40:00 - the collaboration and communication
40:01 - tools such as exchange SharePoint and
40:03 - Skype for business Microsoft's Cloud
40:05 - productivity Services have expanded much
40:07 - beyond what most people think of his
40:09 - office in recent years resulting in
40:11 - Microsoft 365 therefore renaming Office
40:14 - 365 to Microsoft 365 reflects the
40:18 - extension of features and benefits
40:19 - beyond the core Office 365 products and
40:22 - services Microsoft 365 includes
40:25 - everything in Office 365 and more such
40:28 - as Windows teams and other cloud-based
40:30 - security and device management products
40:32 - and services it's designed to help
40:34 - people and businesses achieve more with
40:36 - Innovative apps intelligent cloud
40:37 - service is and world-class security
40:39 - Microsoft 365 is a subscription service
40:42 - that ensures you always have the most
40:44 - up-to-date modern productivity and
40:46 - collaboration tools you'll always have
40:48 - access to the most up-to-date features
40:50 - fixes and security upgrades as well as
40:52 - technical assistance if you already have
40:54 - an Office 365 subscription it
40:57 - automatically becomes a Microsoft 365
40:59 - subscription and no action is needed
41:02 - from your end so that gives us a bit of
41:04 - background of how Microsoft 365 came to
41:06 - be
41:07 - [Music]
41:11 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
41:14 - and we'll be talking about Windows 365.
41:16 - many of you are probably familiar with
41:18 - Windows Windows is a well-known
41:20 - operating system with the most recent
41:22 - versions being Windows 10 and 11. so
41:24 - what is Windows 365 Windows 365 isn't it
41:29 - operating system and it isn't installed
41:31 - on your computer in the same way that
41:32 - Windows is it's a subscription service
41:34 - for organizations that allows you to
41:36 - create and run PCS remotely Windows 365
41:39 - is referred to as a cloud PC this is
41:42 - because it securely streams your
41:43 - personalized Windows desktop apps
41:45 - settings and content from the cloud to
41:47 - any device a cloud PC is a virtualized
41:50 - computer environment that allows you to
41:51 - stream your Windows Experience from
41:53 - Microsoft's Cloud to any device with a
41:55 - cloud pc windows evolves from a
41:57 - device-based operating system to hybrid
41:59 - personalized Computing so Windows 365
42:02 - has the following capabilities it's
42:05 - simple to deploy and manage from a
42:06 - single console it uses a local profile
42:09 - that is stored directly on the cloud PC
42:11 - you can easily set up and scale Cloud
42:13 - PCS to fit your needs and securely
42:15 - support changing Workforce needs and new
42:16 - business scenarios it provides native
42:19 - integration across Azure active
42:20 - directory Microsoft Defender Microsoft
42:23 - 365 applications and Microsoft endpoint
42:26 - manager and it's also dedicated to a
42:28 - single user Windows 365 is available in
42:31 - two subscription offerings Windows 365
42:35 - business which is made specifically for
42:37 - smaller organizations of up to 300 seats
42:39 - who want ready to use cloud PCS with
42:41 - simple management options Windows 365
42:44 - Enterprises for larger organizations who
42:46 - want unlimited seats for creating Cloud
42:48 - PCS so that's windows 365.
42:51 - [Music]
42:55 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
42:58 - and we're taking a look at the main part
42:59 - of the course Microsoft 365. so
43:02 - Microsoft 365 is a cloud-based
43:05 - subscription service that consists of an
43:06 - integrated portfolio of products like
43:08 - office apps teams Windows world-class

44:46 - cost of Risk by enhancing your security
44:48 - and compliance posture and 365 manages
44:51 - hardware and software more efficiently
44:52 - so it can focus on strategy it reduce
44:55 - hard cost us like real estate and travel
44:57 - through flexible work from anywhere you
44:59 - can also access Microsoft 365 through
45:02 - portal.office.com so that's the general
45:04 - overview of Microsoft 365.
45:07 - [Music]
45:11 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
45:13 - and we'll be talking about Microsoft 365
45:16 - apps so Microsoft 365 apps is a suite of
45:20 - apps that help you stay connected and
45:21 - complete your tasks these apps consist
45:23 - of the office suite of applications such
45:25 - as word excel PowerPoint OneNote Outlook
45:28 - teams and more Microsoft 365 apps
45:32 - provides the benefits of the cloud
45:33 - giving you the flexibility to work from
45:35 - anywhere at any time on any device
45:36 - helping you be more productive so let's
45:39 - go over the three key features of
45:40 - Microsoft 365 apps Microsoft 365 apps
45:44 - allow you to work across multiple
45:46 - devices depending on your plan you can
45:48 - install Microsoft 365 apps on up to five
45:51 - PCS or Macs as well as five tablets iPad
45:54 - windows or Android the apps that you
45:57 - work with are always up to date you
45:59 - won't have to spend time installing
46:00 - updates or worrying about when new
46:02 - features will be introduced you and your
46:04 - co-workers will always be working with
46:05 - the latest up-to-date features Microsoft
46:07 - 365 apps lets you work intelligently
46:10 - through connected experiences it
46:12 - includes intelligent features also
46:14 - called connected experiences to help you
46:16 - get work done faster and create amazing
46:18 - content also in terms of subscriptions
46:20 - Microsoft 365 apps are available in both
46:24 - Microsoft 365 Apps for business and
46:26 - Microsoft 365 apps for Enterprise
46:29 - subscriptions so here we have a list of
46:32 - some of the applications included in
46:34 - Microsoft 365 apps we'll give a general
46:37 - overview of what they do and for some
46:39 - we'll cover in Greater detail later on
46:40 - in the course Microsoft teams can help
46:42 - you bring everyone together in one
46:44 - location to meet chat call and
46:46 - collaborate word can help you create
46:48 - impressive documents and improve your
46:50 - writing with built-in intelligent
46:51 - features like Microsoft editor and
46:53 - researcher Excel can help you simplify
46:55 - complex data and create easy to read
46:57 - spreadsheets and visualizations
46:58 - PowerPoint can help you easily produce
47:01 - polished presentations that stand out
47:02 - with intelligent features like presenter
47:04 - coach and PowerPoint designer Outlook
47:06 - allows you to keep track of your email
47:08 - calendar tasks and contacts all in one
47:10 - in place OneNote can help you keep track
47:13 - of your notes by organizing them into
47:14 - tabs and subsections resulting in a
47:17 - single digital notebook so that's the
47:19 - overview of Microsoft 365 apps
47:22 - [Music]
47:25 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
47:28 - and we'll be going over the Work
47:29 - Management capabilities and tools in
47:31 - Microsoft 365. the first one we'll be
47:34 - talking about is Microsoft Project so
47:37 - Microsoft Project is a powerful project
47:39 - management tool designed for larger more
47:41 - complex work tasks project for the web
47:43 - is Microsoft's most recent offering for
47:45 - cloud-based work and project management
47:47 - it provides simple and Powerful Work
47:49 - Management capabilities to meet most
47:51 - needs and roles project managers and
47:54 - team members can utilize project for the
47:55 - web to plan and manage work that
47:57 - requires Dynamic scheduling subtests and
48:00 - or dependent tasks regardless of Team
48:02 - size you can take on tasks of various
48:05 - sizes from little projects to large
48:06 - initiatives so now let's go over some of
48:09 - the features of project so you can start
48:11 - a project quickly and assign tasks and
48:13 - schedules while keeping team members and
48:15 - managers on the same page project
48:17 - provides the smart scheduling engine
48:19 - which will automatically update the
48:21 - timeline saving you time and effort you
48:23 - can utilize the easy to use views such
48:25 - as grid views Camden style task boards
48:27 - and timeline Gantt charts you can
48:29 - integrate with Microsoft teams to
48:31 - improve collaboration across the project
48:32 - in power bi you can create attractive
48:35 - interactive dashboards to see every
48:37 - aspect of the project at a glance
48:38 - finally it's extensible with other
48:40 - platform apps and data because project
48:42 - is built on the Power Platform so that's
48:45 - Microsoft Project
48:46 - [Music]
48:50 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
48:53 - and the next Work Management tool in
48:55 - Microsoft 365 we'll be talking about is
48:57 - Microsoft planner so Microsoft planner
49:00 - is a user-friendly collaborative task
49:02 - management tool for planning managing
49:04 - and completing task-based initiatives it
49:07 - provides a simple and visual way for
49:08 - teams to organize their work planner is
49:11 - a web-based application that can be
49:12 - accessed from anywhere and it also has a

49:17 - now let's go over some of the features
49:18 - of Microsoft planner so you can create a
49:21 - plan to give task-based teamwork
49:22 - structure and to organize the activities
49:24 - in your project you can assign and
49:26 - manage tasks on a canvan board using
49:28 - task cards and add those tasks to
49:30 - buckets task cards provide various
49:32 - information such as due dates status
49:34 - priority checklists labels and file
49:37 - attachments you can manage the
49:39 - notifications you receive to stay on top
49:41 - of deadlines Microsoft planner lets you
49:43 - keep track of your team's progress with
49:45 - colorful visual cues and built-in status

49:53 - your entire plan and individual tasks
49:54 - you can also integrate with teams by
49:56 - adding a tasks by planner tab so that
49:58 - lets you assign tasks with admissions in
50:00 - Word Excel and PowerPoint and add your
50:03 - plans to your Outlook calendar so that's
50:05 - Microsoft planner
50:06 - [Music]
50:10 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
50:13 - and we'll be talking about Microsoft
50:14 - bookings so Microsoft bookings is a
50:17 - web-based appointment scheduling and
50:18 - management system with Microsoft
50:20 - bookings scheduling and managing
50:22 - appointments is made easier it includes

87:31 - versions of the operating system with
87:33 - Windows client there are two release
87:35 - types feature updates and quality
87:37 - updates feature updates are scheduled
87:39 - typically twice a year in March and
87:41 - September they include new
87:42 - functionalities for the operating system
87:44 - quality updates or monthly cumulative
87:46 - updates they contain security patches
87:49 - and other changes to make the operating
87:50 - system more reliable next we'll be
87:53 - talking about servicing channels so
87:55 - servicing channels are the first way to
87:57 - separate users into deployment groups
87:58 - for feature in quality updates there are
88:01 - three servicing channels each Channel
88:03 - each provides different levels of
88:04 - flexibility for when these updates are
88:06 - delivered to client computers the first
88:08 - servicing channel is the windows Insider
88:10 - program which allows businesses to test
88:12 - and provide feedback on features that
88:14 - will be released in the next feature
88:15 - update these features will be delivered
88:17 - as soon as possible during the
88:19 - development cycle through a process
88:20 - called flighting the general
88:22 - availability Channel provides new
88:23 - functionality with feature update
88:25 - releases annually this model is ideal
88:27 - for pilot deployments testing of feature
88:29 - updates and users such as developers who
88:32 - need to work with the latest features
88:33 - the last servicing channel is the
88:35 - long-term servicing Channel which is
88:37 - designed for specialist devices that
88:39 - don't run office apps like medical
88:40 - equipment or ATMs this channel receives
88:43 - new features every two or three years so
88:45 - that's the servicing channels now we'll
88:48 - be talking about the deployment rings so
88:50 - deployment rings are a deployment method
88:52 - used to separate devices into a
88:53 - deployment timeline they are changes
88:55 - that are rolled out in phases to
88:57 - specific groups of users or computers
88:59 - panty risks or development difficulties
89:01 - associated with Windows updates are
89:03 - reduced by this gradual controlled and
89:05 - tested deployment each ring represents a
89:07 - group of users or devices that receive a
89:09 - particular update together so a common
89:11 - ring structure uses three deployment
89:13 - groups preview is for Planning and
89:15 - Development the purpose of the preview
89:17 - ring is to evaluate the new features of
89:19 - the update limited is for pilot and
89:21 - validation the purpose of the limited
89:23 - ring is to validate the update on
89:24 - representative devices across the
89:26 - network broad is for wide deployment
89:28 - once the device is in the limited ring
89:30 - have had a sufficient stabilization
89:31 - period it's time for broad deployment
89:33 - across the network so that's Windows as
89:36 - a service and all the deployment and
89:38 - release models that it has load and
89:39 - deploy Microsoft 365 apps to your client
89:42 - computers so this method uses the ODT to
89:45 - manage your deployment and the office
89:47 - customization tool to create a
89:48 - cloud-based configuration file that
89:50 - specifies the Microsoft 365 apps that
89:53 - are installed the next method is to
89:55 - deploy from a local source with the
89:57 - office deployment tool with this method
89:58 - you may manage your deployment with the
90:00 - ODT and download and deploy office from
90:02 - a local Source on your network the last
90:04 - method is to self-install from the cloud
90:06 - which is probably the easiest one to
90:08 - perform you manage your deployment from
90:10 - the office portal and have your users
90:11 - install office on their client devices
90:13 - directly from the portal so those are
90:15 - the four different methods to deploy
90:17 - Microsoft 365 apps one of the benefits
90:21 - of Microsoft 365 apps is that Microsoft
90:23 - provides new and updated features for
90:25 - office apps regularly Microsoft provides
90:28 - you with something called update
90:29 - channels these allow you to manage how
90:31 - frequently new feature updates are sent
90:33 - to your company here are the three
90:34 - primary update channels for Microsoft
90:36 - 365 apps the first one is current
90:39 - Channel which receives feature updates
90:41 - at least once a month but there's no
90:43 - exact set schedule update this channel
90:45 - also receives security and non-security
90:47 - updates around two or three times a
90:49 - month Microsoft recommends this channel
90:51 - because it provides users with the
90:52 - newest office features as soon as
90:54 - they're ready the next update channel is
90:56 - monthly Enterprise Channel which
90:58 - receives feature updates once a month
90:59 - this monthly update can include feature
91:02 - security and non-security Updates this
91:04 - provides users with new office features
91:06 - once a month on a predictable release
91:08 - schedule and then we have semi-annual
91:10 - Enterprise Channel which receives
91:11 - feature updates every six months this
91:14 - update can include feature security and
91:16 - non-security Updates this is only for
91:18 - select devices in your company that need
91:20 - extensive testing before rolling out new
91:22 - office features Microsoft also provides
91:24 - each update Channel with two other types
91:26 - of updates that are released on the
91:28 - second Tuesday of every month there are
91:30 - security updates such as updates that
91:31 - help keep office protected from
91:33 - potential malicious attacks and
91:35 - non-security updates also known as
91:37 - quality updates are updates that provide
91:39 - stability or performance improvements
91:41 - for office so that's the Microsoft 365
91:44 - apps update channels types
91:46 - [Music]
91:50 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
91:52 - and we're taking a look at how to deploy
91:54 - Office 365 using the office
91:56 - customization tool the first thing you
91:58 - want to do is to go to Google and search
92:00 - for office deployment tool and you want
92:02 - to go to the link where it says office
92:03 - deployment tool Microsoft 365 It's
92:06 - usually the first one that shows up and
92:08 - click on it once you click on it it'll
92:11 - take you to the Microsoft 365 office
92:13 - deployment tool page where you can
92:14 - download the office deployment tool so
92:16 - you want to click on download and you
92:18 - can save this to any folder you prefer
92:20 - but for this demonstration I'll place it
92:22 - on the desktop okay the next thing you
92:25 - want to do is to go to the URL called
92:26 - config.office.com so you can access the
92:29 - office customization tool alternatively
92:31 - you can also access this through your
92:33 - Microsoft 365 admin Center in your all
92:35 - admin Center Page and by navigating to
92:38 - office configuration
92:39 - once you are at the office configuration
92:42 - page you'll want to click on go to
92:43 - office customization tool the next step
92:46 - is to click on create this is where you
92:48 - can customize how you want to deploy
92:49 - your office 365. for architecture you
92:53 - can choose 32-bit or 64-bit depending on
92:56 - your system settings for this example
92:58 - we'll select 64-bit for the type of
93:00 - office suite we have a lot of options
93:02 - such as Microsoft 365 apps for
93:04 - Enterprise Microsoft 365 apps for
93:07 - Business Office ltsc Professional Plus
93:10 - 2021 and many more for this example
93:12 - we'll select the Microsoft 365 Apps for
93:15 - business we're not interested in Vizio
93:17 - so we'll select none for this we're not
93:20 - interested in Project products we'll
93:22 - select none for this and we don't need
93:24 - any additional products
93:26 - for the type of update Channel we'll go
93:28 - with current Channel because it's
93:29 - recommended and it provides users with
93:31 - the newest office features as soon as
93:33 - they are ready we'll select latest for
93:35 - the type of version for the app sections
93:38 - you can select which apps you want to
93:39 - include or exclude we can leave this as
93:41 - the default selections for the languages
93:43 - we'll select English for the primary
93:45 - language we won't be needed any
93:47 - additional language tools or packages
93:48 - for the installation options we can
93:51 - choose from Office content delivery
93:52 - Network local Source or Microsoft
93:54 - endpoint configuration manger we can
93:57 - leave this as office content delivery
93:58 - Network in the default settings for the
94:00 - update and upgrade options we can also
94:03 - leave these as the default settings
94:06 - for the licensing and activation section
94:08 - we won't need to make any changes here
94:12 - in the general section it's okay to
94:15 - leave this blank it's not mandatory to
94:17 - provide your organization name and
94:18 - description unless your company requests
94:20 - it for the application preferences we
94:22 - don't really need to select anything
94:23 - here either so you can scroll down and
94:26 - click on finish
94:30 - we'll give this configuration file a
94:32 - simple name called configuration after
94:34 - reviewing all of the configuration
94:36 - settings you can click on download
94:39 - you'll need to specify the format you
94:41 - want as the user's default you can keep
94:43 - the current settings choose office open
94:45 - XML formats or Open document format for
94:48 - this example we'll select keep current
94:50 - settings click ok then click on download
94:53 - again
94:54 - save the XML document on the folder you
94:56 - prefer or the same folder where you
94:58 - downloaded the office deployment tool
95:00 - earlier so now on our desktop we have
95:02 - two files the office deployment tool and
95:05 - the configuration XML file we will need
95:07 - to create a new folder called Microsoft
95:09 - apps for business or you can name it
95:10 - office for short but you'll need to
95:12 - remember this name for the next steps
95:15 - we'll cut and paste the office
95:16 - deployment tool and the office
95:18 - configuration file in the Microsoft apps
95:20 - for business folder we created
95:22 - double-click on the office configuration
95:24 - tool file
95:26 - and select the box and click continue
95:29 - select the folder Microsoft apps for
95:31 - business and click OK this will extract
95:34 - all the files to install Microsoft apps
95:36 - for business into the folder the next
95:39 - step is to move the Microsoft apps for
95:40 - business folder into the local C drive
95:56 - then you'll need to open up command
95:58 - prompt as administrator you'll need to
95:59 - run a few simple commands to complete
96:01 - this process some of you should be
96:03 - familiar with these
96:04 - enter in c d c colon backslash Microsoft
96:08 - apps for business or the name of the
96:10 - folder you created this changes
96:12 - directory to the Microsoft apps for
96:13 - business folder then you run setup dot
96:17 - exe slash configure configuration.xml
96:28 - and this should install office or
96:29 - Microsoft apps for business based on
96:31 - your configuration file you created this
96:34 - can take a while so you'll need to wait
96:36 - for it to complete downloading and
96:37 - installing after this is done you have
96:40 - successfully installed office on your
96:42 - computer
96:43 - [Music]
96:47 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
96:49 - and we'll be taking a look at the
96:50 - analytics capabilities of Microsoft
96:52 - workplace analytics so Microsoft

97:57 - [Music]
98:01 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
98:03 - and we'll be talking about the
98:05 - analytical capabilities of my analytics
98:07 - so my analytics is an application
98:09 - designed to help employees and their
98:11 - managers gain insight into how workers
98:12 - spend their time with the goal of
98:14 - optimizing tasks and making them more
98:16 - efficient the application can track data
98:18 - such as time spent in meetings Outlook
98:20 - emails productivity and time spent
98:22 - working late my analytics is also part
98:24 - of Microsoft Viva so Microsoft organizes
98:28 - these tasks into categories such as
98:29 - Meeting hours email hours Focus hours
98:32 - after hours work who is in a user's
98:34 - Network and a basic time overview the
98:36 - time overview can be used to provide a
98:38 - quick overview of how a user is spending
98:40 - their time the network section focuses
98:42 - on analyzing who a user collaborates

98:59 - way of stating how much time a user
99:01 - spends working after their official work
99:02 - day also my analytics and insights by my
99:05 - analytics service plans are included
99:07 - with the Microsoft 365 E5 plan so that's
99:10 - my analytics and its key analytical
99:12 - features
99:13 - [Music]
99:17 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
99:19 - and we'll be talking about the
99:20 - capabilities of the Microsoft 365 admin
99:23 - Center in Microsoft 365 user portal so
99:27 - the definition of Microsoft 365 admin

108:09 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
108:12 - and we'll begin covering the security
108:13 - concepts of Microsoft 365 starting with
108:17 - the zero trust methodologies or the zero
108:19 - trust model in particular this is super
108:21 - important because it really lays the
108:23 - foundation of the way we should be
108:24 - thinking about all the security that
108:26 - we're going to be doing within Microsoft
108:27 - 365 Azure or in any cloud service
108:30 - provider because the zero trust model is
108:32 - really what is being adopted today and
108:34 - we'll talk about why that is so the zero
108:37 - trust model operates on the principles
108:39 - of trust no one and verify everything so
108:41 - nowadays you can potentially encounter
108:43 - malicious actors and they're able to
108:45 - bypass conventional access controls this
108:48 - demonstrates that traditional security
108:49 - measures are no longer sufficient we
108:51 - need to come up with a new way to
108:52 - protect ourselves and so that's where
108:54 - Microsoft has come up with their version
108:56 - of a zero trust model called the
108:58 - Microsoft zero trust model and this is
109:00 - based on three principles and six
109:02 - foundational pillars so in the three
109:04 - principles we have verify explicitly
109:06 - least privileged access and assume
109:08 - breach for the six found foundational
109:10 - pillars we have identities and endpoints
109:12 - an easier way of thinking about
109:14 - endpoints is just thinking of them as
109:15 - devices then we have apps data
109:18 - infrastructure and networks and I would
109:20 - say that if you wanted to put an
109:21 - emphasis on anything it's going to be
109:23 - identities because when an identity
109:24 - attempts to access a resource it must be
109:27 - verified with strong authentication and
109:29 - follow these privileged access
109:30 - principles the zero trust model is not
109:33 - unique to Microsoft gcp has its own zero
109:36 - trust model AWS has its own zero trust
109:38 - model but the one here is just going to
109:40 - really work for Microsoft so let's go in
109:43 - more detail on the three principles that
109:44 - are in the Microsoft zero trust model
109:46 - the first principle is verify explicitly
109:49 - and so this always authenticates and
109:50 - authorizes based on all the available
109:52 - data points including user identity
109:54 - location device service or workload data
109:58 - classification and anomalies the next
110:00 - principle is least privileged access so
110:02 - you limit user access with just in time
110:04 - and just enough access risk-based
110:06 - adaptive policies and data protection to
110:08 - protect both data and productivity then
110:11 - we have assumed breach so we need to
110:12 - minimize blast radius and axis should be
110:14 - segmented by Network user device and
110:17 - application we must also verify
110:19 - end-to-end encryption and use analytics
110:21 - to gain visibility Drive threat
110:23 - detection and improve security so that's
110:25 - Microsoft's version of the zero trust
110:27 - model and the three guiding principles
110:29 - [Music]
110:34 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
110:36 - we'll be talking about the six
110:37 - foundational pillars for the Microsoft
110:39 - zero trust model in Greater detail
110:41 - starting with the most important one so
110:43 - identities verifies and secures each
110:45 - identity with strong authentication
110:47 - across your entire digital estate for
110:49 - each of these pillars we're going to
110:51 - talk about some of the related Services
110:52 - I'm not going to describe too much of
110:54 - what they do because we're definitely
110:56 - going to be covering the important ones
110:57 - in this course in great detail but I
110:59 - want you to get some exposure so you see
111:01 - all these names over and over again so
111:03 - the first one is identity access and
111:05 - management or I am the next one is azure
111:08 - active directory and this one gets a lot
111:10 - of attention due to all its identity and
111:12 - access management capabilities we have
111:14 - single site on multi-factor
111:16 - authentication or MFA passwordless
111:18 - authentication which is a subset of MFA
111:21 - risk-based policies and we have identity
111:23 - secure score and you'll see a few
111:25 - different types of secure score like
111:27 - Microsoft secure score and compliance
111:29 - score in this course so it's something
111:30 - that's very useful throughout Microsoft
111:32 - 365 and azure measure next we have
111:35 - endpoints and it's easy to think of
111:37 - these as devices because their endpoints
111:38 - are used to gain visibility into devices
111:40 - accessing the network ensuring
111:43 - compliance and health status before
111:44 - granting access the endpoint is what
111:46 - grants access for this for this we have
111:48 - Azure ID device manager to register our
111:50 - devices with our identity provider
111:52 - generally the controls underneath which
111:54 - is the mobile device management and
111:56 - mobile application management is managed
111:58 - by Microsoft InTune and this service is
112:00 - now actually a part of Microsoft
112:02 - endpoint manager and if we want to get
112:04 - protection around our endpoints then we
112:06 - have Microsoft Defender for endpoint but
112:08 - we have Defender for a lot features in
112:10 - Microsoft and you'll see that soon
112:12 - enough then you have dlps data loss
112:14 - prevention policies so that we do not
112:16 - lose our data so that it does not get
112:18 - disclosed and we can keep our sensitive
112:19 - data protected so for apps we have
112:22 - discovered Shadow I.T so ensure
112:24 - appropriate in-app permissions gate
112:25 - access based on real-time analytics and
112:28 - monitor control user actions so for this
112:30 - we have policy-based access controls we
112:33 - can use the Microsoft soft Cloud app
112:35 - security Azure ID application proxy
112:37 - e-discovery and we have just in time
112:39 - virtual machine access so on to the last
112:42 - three pillars we have data so use
112:44 - intelligence to classify and label data
112:46 - encrypt and restrict access based on
112:48 - organizational policies so we move from
112:50 - perimeter-based data protection to
112:52 - data-driven protection so here we can
112:54 - use sensitivity labels Microsoft
112:57 - information protection data
112:58 - classification Azure information
113:00 - protection scatter so AIP scanner does
113:03 - decision-based policies and data loss
113:05 - prevention policies all of this stuff
113:07 - listed in the data pillar is in the
113:09 - Microsoft 365 compliance Center this is
113:12 - where all this stuff comes into play
113:13 - which we'll see later on next we have
113:15 - infrastructure so use Telemetry to
113:17 - detect attacks and anomalies
113:19 - automatically Block in flag risk
113:21 - behaviors and employ at least privilege
113:23 - access principles so here we can use the
113:25 - Azure security Center Azure ID managed
113:28 - identities user and resource
113:30 - segmentation vnets hearing rules
113:32 - privileged identity management network
113:34 - security groups application security
113:36 - groups Azure firewall Microsoft Defender
113:39 - for endpoint Microsoft Defender for
113:41 - identity and Azure Sentinel these last
113:44 - three we'll be talking about in Greater
113:45 - detail the last pillar here is Network
113:47 - so ensure devices and users are not
113:50 - trusted just because they're on an
113:51 - internal Network encrypt all internal
113:53 - Communications limit access by policy
113:56 - and employee micro segmentation and
113:58 - real-time threat detection so here we
114:00 - can do Network segmentation Azure DDOS
114:03 - Protection Service Azure firewall Azure
114:05 - web application firewall also known as
114:08 - Waf Azure VPN Azure ad proxy Azure
114:11 - Bastion and SSL TLS so that's the zero
114:15 - trust model six foundational pillars and
114:17 - some of the related services that are
114:19 - associated with each pillar
114:21 - [Music]
114:24 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
114:27 - and we're taking a look at defense and
114:28 - depth so defense in depth uses a layered
114:31 - approach to security rather than relying
114:33 - on a single perimeter a defense and
114:35 - depth strategy uses a series of
114:36 - mechanisms to slow the advance of an
114:38 - attack there are seven layers of
114:40 - security that Microsoft wants you to
114:42 - know it's kind of similar to the shared
114:43 - responsibility Model A lot of times we
114:46 - see these things when organizations or
114:47 - providers are talking about their
114:49 - security centers like the actual data
114:51 - centers and how they're secured but this
114:53 - is more General it doesn't necessarily
114:55 - have to apply to a data center but let's
114:57 - go and work our way through inside out
114:59 - at the core we have data so access to
115:02 - business and customer data and
115:03 - encryption to protect data then we have
115:05 - application so applications are secure
115:08 - and free of security vulnerabilities
115:09 - then you have compute so access to VMS
115:12 - ports on premises and cloudin then
115:15 - Network so limit communication between
115:17 - resources using segmentation and access
115:19 - controls then you have perimeter so
115:21 - distributed denial of service protection
115:23 - to filter large-scale attacks before
115:25 - they can cause a denial of service for
115:27 - users identity and access so controlling
115:30 - access to infrastructure and change
115:31 - controls and then you have physical
115:33 - security so limiting access to a data
115:36 - center to only authorize Personnel so
115:38 - the idea is that if you really want to
115:39 - get to the data you've got to go through
115:41 - all the steps here these are all the
115:42 - layers of defense and so I just want to
115:45 - give extra emphasis to Identity and
115:46 - access because this one's the most outer
115:48 - one besides the physical security so
115:51 - they would say something like the modern
115:52 - perimeter is defined based on your
115:54 - identity another thing I want to mention
115:56 - is that even though the perimeter layer
115:57 - says it provides distributed denial of
115:59 - service protection to filter large-scale
116:01 - attacks and so on this is actually a bit
116:03 - misleading the DDOS protection standard
116:06 - provides multi-layered protection when
116:08 - deployed with a web application firewall
116:10 - it should protect both of the network
116:12 - layer and at the application layer
116:14 - emphasizing especially on the network
116:16 - layer so here's an architecture of DDOS
116:18 - protection standard being used you can
116:21 - see that it will always be placed in the
116:22 - network layer so it's applied to the
116:24 - virtual Network work subnets network
116:26 - security groups and so on a lot of
116:28 - people get it confused with perimeter
116:30 - layer when it should be the network
116:31 - layer so that's defense and depth
116:34 - [Music]
116:41 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
116:44 - and we're taking a look at Azure active
116:46 - directory also known as Azure ID and
116:48 - it's Microsoft's cloud-based identity
116:50 - and access management service which
116:52 - helps your employees sign in and access
116:53 - resources it's going to help us both
116:56 - externally and with internal resources
116:57 - so on the external side we're looking at
117:00 - Microsoft 365 the Azure portal and SAS
117:03 - applications and for internal resources
117:06 - we have applications that reside within
117:08 - your internal Network and access to
117:10 - workstations that may reside on premise
117:12 - one of the best features of azure ID is
117:14 - single side on that's what a lot of
117:16 - companies want it for in terms of what
117:18 - types of azure active directory there
117:19 - are it's broken down to four editions
117:21 - with each subsequent tier having all the
117:23 - features of the previous tier and so we
117:25 - have the free tier where you get
117:26 - multi-factor authentication single side
117:29 - on basic security and usage reports and
117:32 - user management we have Office 365 apps
117:35 - so that will give you a company branding
117:37 - service level agreement to sync between
117:39 - on-premises and cloud and the last two I
117:41 - I want you to take note of because we do
117:43 - mention some of the features in this
117:45 - course for these two tiers is premium
117:46 - one and premium two also commonly
117:49 - abbreviated to P1 and P2 so you have
117:51 - hybrid architecture Advanced group
117:53 - access and conditional access and for
117:55 - premium 2 you have identity protection
117:57 - identity governance so again as we move
118:00 - up the tier each of the previous tier
118:02 - has all the features of the prior one so
118:04 - premium 2 has all the features of
118:06 - Premium One in terms of the use case for
118:08 - Azure ID it's for authorizing and
118:10 - authenticating to multiple sources so
118:12 - you can authorize and authenticate to
118:14 - your on-premises active directory to
118:16 - your web application it allows users to
118:18 - log in with their identity provider IDP
118:20 - like Facebook or Google and you can
118:23 - connect to Microsoft 365 or Microsoft
118:25 - Azure Azure ID takes care of all this
118:27 - stuff and so when we're looking at
118:29 - hybrid connections we're talking about
118:31 - Azure dconnect when we're looking at
118:33 - integrating our applications we're doing
118:35 - this through app registrations where we
118:37 - have the b2c service and then you have
118:39 - external identities so that's going to
118:41 - be for your identity any providers and
118:43 - you can also easily integrate with Cloud
118:44 - applications there's no particular
118:46 - service or sub service for that Azure ID
118:49 - naturally does that for you so let's
118:51 - look at the comparison between active
118:53 - directory versus Azure active directory
118:55 - because they're not the same thing so
118:57 - active directory has been around for
118:59 - quite a long time Microsoft introduced
119:01 - active directory domain services in
119:03 - Windows 2000 to give organizations the
119:05 - ability to manage multiple on-premises
119:07 - infrastructure components and systems
119:09 - using a single identity per user and so
119:11 - Azure D takes this approach to the next
119:13 - level by providing organizations with an
119:15 - identity as a service solution for their
119:17 - apps across cloud and on premises so
119:20 - both versions are still used to this day
119:22 - so there's active directory which is
119:24 - used for on-premises and there's Azure
119:26 - ID which is the cloud version and so we
119:28 - see a lot of companies might want to
119:30 - migrate over to Azure D or they might
119:32 - have a particular Legacy licensing that
119:34 - makes it more cost effective or there
119:36 - might be certain security compliances
119:37 - and that's why they're not using Azure
119:39 - ID so both of these are still valid
119:41 - product products just different use
119:43 - cases
119:43 - [Music]
119:47 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
119:49 - and we're taking a look at Cloud
119:51 - identity models so Microsoft 365 uses
119:54 - Azure active directory a cloud-based
119:57 - user identity and authentication Service
119:59 - that's included with your Microsoft 365
120:01 - subscription to manage identities and
120:03 - authentication for Microsoft 365. it's
120:06 - very important to set up your identity
120:08 - infrastructure properly if you want to
120:10 - manage Microsoft 365 user access and
120:13 - permissions for your company so there
120:15 - are two identity models available in
120:17 - Microsoft 365. the first one is cloud
120:19 - only identity this is where you maintain
120:21 - your organization's identities only in
120:23 - the cloud and the Azure d-tenant for
120:25 - your Microsoft 365 subscription performs
120:28 - the authentication with the cloud
120:29 - identity account the second one is
120:31 - hybrid identity this is where you
120:33 - maintain your on-premises active
120:34 - directory domain Services identities and
120:37 - use them for authentication when users
120:38 - access Microsoft 365 cloud services and
120:42 - the Azure d-tenant for your Microsoft
120:44 - 365 subscription handles the
120:46 - authentication process or redirects the
120:48 - user to another identity provider we'll
120:50 - talk more about the two identity models
120:52 - in Greater detail later
120:54 - [Music]
120:57 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
121:00 - and we're taking a closer look at the
121:01 - cloud only identity model so a cloud
121:04 - only identity uses user accounts that
121:06 - exist only in Azure ID it's typically
121:08 - used by small organizations that do not
121:10 - have on-premises servers or do not use a
121:12 - DDS to manage local identities both on
121:15 - premises and remote users use their
121:16 - Azure ID user accounts and passwords to
121:19 - access Microsoft 365 cloud services
121:21 - Azure a de-authenticates user
121:23 - credentials based on its stored user
121:25 - accounts and passwords in terms of
121:27 - administration you manage Cloud
121:29 - identities with tools such as the
121:30 - Microsoft 365 admin Center and windows
121:33 - Powershell because user accounts are
121:34 - only stored in Azure ID and so this is
121:37 - best for organizations that do not have
121:39 - or needed on premises of DDS and their
121:41 - greatest benefit would be that it's
121:42 - simple to use and it requires no extra
121:45 - directory tools or servers so looking at
121:47 - the visual here within your organization
121:49 - you have your on-premises users and your
121:52 - remote users and both of them can access
121:53 - Microsoft 365 with Azure ID using their
121:56 - user accounts all on the cloud so that's
121:58 - the cloud only identity model
122:00 - [Music]
122:04 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
122:07 - and we're taking a more in-depth look at
122:08 - the Hybrid identity model so hybrid
122:11 - identity uses accounts that originate in
122:13 - an on-premises a DDS and have a copy in
122:15 - the Azure a detented of a Microsoft 365
122:17 - subscription any changes that you make
122:19 - to a DDS user accounts are synchronized
122:21 - to their copy in Azure ID except for
122:23 - specific account attributes Azure a
122:26 - dconnect provides the ongoing account
122:27 - synchronization so this runs on an
122:29 - on-premises server checks for changes in
122:31 - the DDS and forwards those changes to
122:34 - Azure ID Azure dconnect provides the
122:36 - ability to filter which accounts are
122:37 - synchronized and whether to synchronize
122:39 - a hash version of user passwords known
122:42 - as password hash synchronization Azure a
122:44 - d password hash synchronization is the
122:46 - simplest way to enable authentication
122:47 - for on-premises directory objects in
122:50 - Azure ID continuing out with hybrid
122:52 - identity your on-premises of DDS is the
122:54 - authoritative source for account
122:55 - information when you implement hybrid
122:57 - identity the Azure d-tenant has a copy
122:59 - of the DDS accounts both on premises and
123:02 - remote users accessing Microsoft 36 65
123:05 - cloud services authenticate against
123:06 - Azure ID so hybrid identity is best for
123:09 - organizations using a DDS or another
123:11 - identity provider and its greatest
123:13 - benefit is that users can use the same
123:15 - credentials when accessing on-premises
123:17 - or cloud-based resources so it's very
123:19 - convenient to use looking at the visual
123:21 - here you have your active directory
123:23 - domain Services accounts and you have
123:25 - servers running Azure dconnect to
123:27 - synchronize and copy the accounts to
123:28 - Azure ID through this both on premises
123:31 - and remote users can access Microsoft
123:33 - 365 to utilize all its apps in cloud
123:35 - services so that's the hybrid identity
123:38 - model
123:38 - [Music]
123:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
123:45 - and we'll be taking a look at
123:46 - multifactor authentication also known as
123:48 - MFA and that's how we'll refer to it
123:50 - throughout the entire course so NFA is a
123:53 - security control that provides an extra
123:55 - level of security where after you fill
123:57 - in your email and password you have to
123:59 - use a second device such as a phone to
124:00 - confirm that you are the owner of the
124:02 - account to log in MFA protects against
124:04 - people who have stolen your password
124:05 - when you're dealing with the
124:07 - verification method it must be based on
124:09 - something you have with you that isn't
124:11 - easily duplicated such as a phone like
124:13 - we mentioned before it could also be
124:15 - something uniquely and biologically have
124:17 - such as your fingerprints face or other
124:19 - biometric attribute by default both
124:22 - Microsoft 365 and Office 365 support MFA
124:26 - for user accounts using a text message
124:28 - sent to a phone that requires the user
124:30 - to type a verification code a phone call
124:32 - and the Microsoft authenticator
124:34 - smartphone app so there are multiple
124:36 - ways you can enable MFA for Microsoft
124:38 - 365 in office 365. the first one is with
124:42 - security defaults then we have with
124:44 - conditional access policies and for each
124:47 - individual user account which is not
124:49 - recommended MFA is available in all
124:51 - Microsoft 365 plans however if you want
124:54 - to gain features such as security
124:56 - defaults or conditional access policies
124:58 - you'll need to get Microsoft 365
125:01 - business premium or Microsoft 365 E3
125:04 - there's even Microsoft 365 E5 if you
125:07 - want Azure identity protection so here
125:10 - is an example where you see my email my
125:12 - password and that is called one factor
125:14 - so I've confirmed my identity like in
125:16 - this one case and then you have the
125:18 - second Factor also known as multi-factor
125:20 - that's usually what we call it and in
125:22 - this case we are sent a verification
125:24 - code to our phone to confirm and that's
125:26 - going to let us get into the system so
125:28 - that's MFA
125:29 - [Music]
125:33 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
125:35 - and we'll be taking a look at
125:37 - conditional access which provides an
125:39 - extra layer of security before allowing
125:40 - authenticated users to access data or
125:43 - other assets so conditional access is
125:45 - implemented through conditional access
125:46 - policies which are a set of rules that
125:49 - specify the conditions under which
125:50 - sign-ins are evaluated and allowed for
125:53 - example you can create a conditional
125:54 - access policy that states if the user
125:57 - account name is a member of a group for
125:58 - users that are assigned The Exchange
126:00 - user password security SharePoint or
126:03 - Global administrator roles require MFA
126:06 - before allowing access this policy
126:08 - allows you to require MFA based on group
126:10 - membership rather than trying to
126:11 - configure individual user accounts for
126:13 - MFA when they're assigned or unassigned
126:15 - from these administrator roles so a
126:17 - conditional access policy analyzes
126:19 - signals signal could be user and
126:21 - location device application real-time
126:24 - risk and we'll go more into detail with
126:25 - all the types of signals in the next
126:27 - slide and the idea is you need to verify
126:29 - every access attempt through Access
126:30 - Control you might have required MFA
126:33 - Locker access and allow access so here
126:36 - is a visual I got from the Microsoft
126:37 - documentation the idea here is you have
126:39 - your signal and you have your user in
126:41 - location application real-time risk and
126:44 - device and here we have to verify every
126:46 - access attempt to meet the conditional
126:47 - access policies that were set to gain
126:49 - access to our apps and data so let's
126:52 - take a closer look at signals signals is
126:55 - metadata associated with an identity
126:56 - attempting to gain access and we'll be
126:59 - going over the full list of signals that
127:00 - are possible conditional access starting
127:02 - with users or group membership so
127:05 - policies Target specific users and
127:07 - groups including admin roles giving
127:09 - admins fine grain control over access
127:10 - then you could have signals that are
127:12 - named location or IP location
127:14 - information so that's a range of ips
127:16 - used when making policy decisions so
127:18 - admins can opt to block or allow traffic
127:20 - from an entire country's IP ranges for
127:23 - devices users with devices of specific
127:25 - platforms are marked with a specific
127:27 - State can be used for applications users
127:30 - attempting to access specific
127:31 - applications can trigger different
127:33 - additional access policies real-time
127:35 - cited risk detection so signals
127:37 - integration with Azure ID identity
127:39 - protection allows conditional access
127:41 - policies to identify sign and behavior
127:43 - and policies can then Force users to
127:45 - perform password changes or multi-factor
127:47 - authentication to reduce the risk level
127:49 - or be blocked from access until
127:51 - administrator takes manual action then
127:53 - you have your Cloud apps or Cloud
127:54 - actions so Cloud apps or actions can
127:57 - include or exclude Cloud applications or
127:59 - user actions that will be subject to
128:00 - policy then there's user risks so from
128:03 - customers with access to Identity
128:04 - protection user risks can be evaluated
128:07 - as part of the conditional access policy
128:09 - user risk represents the probability
128:11 - that a given Identity or account is
128:12 - compromised let's talk about common
128:14 - decisions so these Define the access
128:16 - control that Define what level of access
128:18 - based on the signal information and so
128:21 - this is when we were talking about that
128:22 - verifying steps these are those common
128:24 - decisions so we have block access which
128:27 - is the most restrictive decision then
128:29 - you have Grant access and this is the
128:31 - least restrictive decision but still
128:32 - requires is one or more of the following
128:34 - options so there's require MFA required
128:37 - device to be marked as compliant require
128:39 - hybrid Azure a dejoin device require
128:41 - approved Client app and require app
128:43 - protection policy another important
128:45 - thing to know is that you can use
128:47 - conditional access policies with
128:49 - Microsoft 365 business premium Microsoft
128:52 - 365 E3 and E5 and Azure at D premium P1
128:56 - and Azure D premium P2 licenses so
128:59 - that's the value of conditional access
129:00 - and how you can use conditional access
129:02 - policies to increase your level of
129:04 - security
129:05 - [Music]
129:09 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
129:11 - and we're taking a look at how to enable
129:13 - multi-factor authentication for
129:15 - Microsoft 365 users in the Microsoft 365
129:18 - admin Center there are a couple ways to
129:21 - do this but the easiest way is from the
129:22 - Microsoft 365 admin Center so the first
129:25 - thing you want to do is to go to your
129:27 - app store on your smartphone Android or
129:29 - iOS you want to search for Microsoft
129:31 - authenticator and once you've found it
129:33 - you just download it and install it onto
129:35 - your phone ready to enable the MFA the
129:37 - next section requires you to go to the
129:39 - Microsoft 365 admin page if you work for
129:42 - a business you may not have access to
129:43 - this so you'll need to get it from your
129:45 - it department or get your it support
129:47 - company to do this for you once you're
129:49 - in the Microsoft 365 admin page you need
129:52 - to navigate to the users and then active
129:54 - users along the top right pane along the
129:56 - top here you'll see a button called
129:57 - multi-factor authentication so you click
130:00 - on that and it'll populate the list of
130:01 - users so for this demonstration we'll
130:04 - use the demo user Sam do we created
130:06 - earlier so you see here it says the
130:08 - multi-factor Authentication station
130:09 - status is disabled so we select Sam do
130:12 - and we click on enable and click on
130:14 - enable multi-factor Authentication
130:16 - now the user Sam do is enabled for
130:18 - multi-factor authentication but we need
130:21 - to validate this change so you'll need
130:22 - to go the Microsoft 365 login page or
130:25 - Office 365 login page
130:28 - first we'll need to site in with another
130:29 - account which is Sam do
130:32 - I will sign in as the user Sam do with
130:34 - the username and password I'm just going
130:36 - to copy and paste these in here let's
130:38 - just see what happens here once we enter
130:40 - the password now because we've enabled
130:42 - it in the back end of Microsoft 365.
130:44 - it's asking us to enable multi-factor
130:47 - authentication so it's saying your
130:49 - organization needs more information to
130:50 - keep your account secure so let's click
130:53 - on next
130:56 - so now it's telling us to install
130:58 - Microsoft authenticator as the type of
131:00 - MFA there are a few other ways to set
131:02 - this up such as authentication phone or
131:04 - office phone but we're going to use
131:06 - mobile app for this demonstration as
131:07 - we've downloaded Microsoft
131:08 - authentication earlier so we want to
131:11 - receive notifications for verification
131:13 - so we'll click on next the next thing
131:15 - you want to do is go to your phone and
131:17 - open the Microsoft authentication app
131:19 - and the first thing you want to do is to
131:21 - click on the three dots on the top right
131:22 - and click on add account so we click on
131:25 - add account we should select worker
131:27 - school account and then you'll get a
131:28 - little prob saying scan QR code so we
131:31 - click on there and all we simply do now
131:32 - is point your phone at the computer
131:33 - screen and it'll scan the QR code just
131:36 - wait a couple of seconds and then it'll
131:38 - list it in your authenticator app so you
131:40 - click on the email address so back onto
131:42 - your screen click on next to proceed
131:44 - so now we'll be able to test this out so
131:47 - on your device it's saying please
131:48 - respond to the notification and it will
131:50 - tell your device to approve this site on
131:52 - so you click on approve and it should be
131:54 - successful
131:55 - the notification has been approved and
131:57 - so you click on next
131:59 - the Microsoft authenticator app has been
132:01 - successfully registered so we click done
132:06 - since it's our first time signing on the
132:08 - user Sam do we'll need to create a new
132:10 - password for the user
132:15 - after that's complete the user should be
132:17 - able to successfully log in and the next
132:19 - time the user attempts to sign in you'll
132:21 - need to approve using the Microsoft
132:23 - authenticator app multi-factor
132:24 - authentication method again
132:26 - so that's how you enable multi-factor
132:29 - authentication on your Microsoft 365
132:31 - user
132:32 - [Music]
132:36 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
132:38 - and we're taking a look here at
132:40 - Microsoft 365 Defender which is a
132:42 - unified pre and post breach Enterprise
132:44 - defense Suite that natively coordinates
132:46 - responses such as detection prevention
132:48 - and investigation across endpoints
132:51 - identities emails and applications to
132:54 - provide integrated protection against
132:55 - sophisticated attacks so Microsoft 365
132:58 - Defender allows admins to assess threat
133:00 - signals from endpoints applications
133:02 - email and identities to determine an
133:05 - attack scope and impact it provides
133:07 - detailed Insight on how the threat
133:08 - occurred and what systems were affected
133:10 - Microsoft 365 Defender can then take
133:13 - automated action to prevent or stop the
133:15 - attack so if you're looking for where
133:17 - the service is you'd open up the portal
133:18 - at office.com and find it on the side
133:21 - menu and click on security that's where
133:23 - you'll find Microsoft 365 Defender so
133:26 - Microsoft 365 Defender is composed of
133:28 - the following Services it has Microsoft
133:31 - Defender for identity Microsoft Defender
133:33 - for endpoint Microsoft Defender for
133:35 - cloud apps preview obviously known as
133:37 - Microsoft Cloud app security then
133:39 - there's Microsoft Defender for Office
133:41 - 365 Microsoft 365 Defender portal and
133:45 - Microsoft secure score here's just a
133:47 - graphic to reiterate over those four
133:49 - Services the ones in Boulder the core
133:51 - services but we'll be going more into
133:53 - detail of all of them later so that's
133:55 - Microsoft 365 Defender
133:57 - [Music]
134:02 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
134:04 - we'll be talking about Microsoft
134:05 - Defender for endpoint So within
134:08 - Microsoft 365 we have endpoints and
134:10 - these are a set of destination IP
134:12 - addresses DNS domain names and URLs for
134:15 - Microsoft 365 traffic on the internet so
134:18 - to optimize performance for M365
134:20 - cloud-based Services these endpoints
134:23 - need special handling by client browsers
134:24 - and the devices in your Edge Network and
134:27 - these devices include firewalls SSL
134:29 - break and inspect and packet inspection
134:31 - devices and data loss prevention systems
134:33 - here is an image showing what it looks
134:35 - like again it's just IP addresses and
134:38 - DNS domain names so endpoints are
134:40 - grouped into four service areas exchange
134:42 - online SharePoint online and OneDrive
134:45 - for business Skype for business online
134:46 - and Microsoft teams and M365 common in
134:50 - office online so it's just a bunch of
134:52 - these things here on the left hand side
134:53 - but it's specialized for those
134:55 - particular areas so now taking a look
134:58 - here at Microsoft Defender for endpoint
134:59 - is an Enterprise endpoint security
135:01 - platform designed to help Enterprise
135:03 - networks prevent detect investigate and
135:06 - respond to Advanced threats and so
135:08 - Defender for in point uses the following
135:10 - combination of Technologies built into
135:11 - Windows 10 and Microsoft cloud service
135:13 - so we have in point behavioral sensors
135:16 - which are embedded in Windows 10 the
135:18 - sensors collect and process behavioral
135:20 - signals from the operating system and
135:22 - send this sensor data to your private
135:23 - isolated Cloud instances of Microsoft
135:25 - Defender for endpoint then you have
135:27 - Cloud security analytics so this is
135:30 - leveraging Big Data device learning and
135:32 - unique Microsoft Optics across the
135:34 - windows ecosystem Enterprise Cloud
135:36 - products such as Office 365 and online
135:39 - assets behavioral signals are translated
135:41 - into insights detections and recommended
135:44 - responses to Advanced threats then we
135:46 - have threatened intelligence this is
135:47 - generated by Microsoft Hunter's security
135:50 - teams and augmented by threat
135:51 - intelligence providers by Partners
135:53 - threat intelligence enables Defender for
135:55 - endpoint to identify attack attacker
135:57 - tools techniques procedures and generate
136:00 - alerts when they are observed in
136:01 - collected sensor data so that's
136:03 - Microsoft 365 Defender for endpoint and
136:06 - all the Technologies it uses to prevent
136:07 - Advanced threats
136:08 - [Music]
136:16 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
136:19 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft 365
136:21 - Defender for identity so Defender for
136:24 - identity is a cloud-based security
136:25 - solution that leverages your on-premise
136:27 - active directory data which are called
136:29 - signals to identify detect and
136:32 - investigate Advanced threats compromised
136:34 - identities and malicious Insider actions
136:36 - directed at your organization it detects
136:39 - Advanced attacks in hybrid environments
136:40 - to monitor users entity behavior and
136:43 - activities with learning based analytics
136:45 - it protects user identities and
136:47 - credentials stored in active directory
136:49 - identify and investigate suspicious user
136:51 - activities and advanced attacks
136:53 - throughout the kill chain and provide
136:54 - clear incident information on a simple
136:56 - timeline for fast triage so going into
136:59 - more depth with the things we just
137:00 - talked about for Monitor and profile
137:02 - user behavior and activities Defender
137:05 - for identity monitors and analyzes user
137:07 - activities and information across your
137:09 - network including permissions and group
137:11 - membership creating a behavioral
137:13 - Baseline for each user for protect Tech
137:15 - user identities and reduce the attack
137:16 - surface it provides insights on identity
137:19 - configurations and suggested security
137:21 - best practices and through security
137:23 - reports and user profile analytics it
137:25 - helps reduce your organizational attack
137:27 - surface making it harder to compromise
137:29 - user credentials and Advance an attack
137:31 - for identify suspicious activities and
137:33 - advanced attacks across the Cyber attack
137:35 - kill chain Defender for identity
137:37 - identifies these Advanced threats of the
137:39 - source throughout the entire Cyber
137:40 - attack kill chain reconnaissance
137:42 - compromise credentials lateral movements
137:45 - and domain dominance you can use the
137:47 - defender for identity attack timeline
137:49 - view and the intelligence of smart
137:50 - analytics to stay focused on what
137:52 - matters also you can use Defender for
137:54 - identity to quickly investigate threats
137:56 - and gain insights across the
137:58 - organization for users devices and
138:00 - network resources so Microsoft Defender
138:03 - for identity monitors your domain
138:05 - controllers by capturing and parsing
138:06 - Network traffic and leveraging windows
138:08 - events directly from your domain
138:10 - controllers that analyzes the data for
138:12 - attacks and threats so here is the
138:14 - architecture sure of it first we have
138:16 - our domain controller over here then we
138:18 - have Microsoft Defender for identity
138:20 - then it's going to go to the Microsoft
138:21 - Cloud app security which is now the
138:23 - Microsoft Defender for apps so that we
138:25 - can do some analysis later on you could
138:28 - pass it over to sim integration or Azure
138:30 - Sentinel for some security information
138:31 - or event management as well and things
138:34 - like that so by utilizing profiling
138:37 - deterministic detection machine learning
138:39 - behavioral algorithms Defender for
138:41 - identity learns about your network
138:42 - enables detection of for anomalies and
138:45 - warns you of suspicious activities and
138:47 - that's Defender for identity hey this is
138:49 - Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be
138:51 - taking a look at Microsoft Defender for
138:53 - office 365. so Microsoft Defender for
138:56 - Office 365 protects against Advanced
138:59 - threats by email messages links URLs
139:02 - Microsoft teams SharePoint online
139:04 - OneDrive for business and other clients
139:06 - and protection is provided via reports
139:09 - thread investigations threat responses
139:11 - and threat protection policies and
139:13 - there's three available subscriptions we
139:16 - have exchange online protection the
139:18 - defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan
139:21 - two and Office 365 security Builds on
139:24 - the core protections offered by EOP so
139:26 - EOP is present in any subscription where
139:28 - exchange online mailboxes can be found
139:30 - so going into more detail here for EOP
139:33 - it's a cloud-based filtering service
139:35 - that protects your organizations against
139:37 - spam malware and other email threats the
139:39 - defender for office P1 provides safe
139:42 - attachment which checks email
139:43 - attachments for malicious content safe
139:45 - links where the links are scanned for
139:47 - each clicking A Safe Link remains
139:49 - accessible but malicious links are
139:51 - blocked it provides protection for
139:53 - SharePoint OneDrive and Microsoft teams
139:55 - it identifies and blocks malicious files
139:58 - and team sites and document libraries
140:00 - anti-phishing protection so this detects
140:02 - attempts to impersonate your users and
140:04 - internal or custom domains real-time
140:06 - detection it's a real-time report that
140:08 - allows you to identify and analyze
140:10 - recent threats the defender for office
140:12 - P2 this includes all the defender office
140:14 - sp1 features so we have threat trackers
140:17 - the latest Intelligence on cyber
140:19 - security issues takes counter
140:21 - measurements before an actual threat we
140:23 - have threat Explorer so real-time
140:25 - reports that allows you to identify and
140:26 - analyze recent threats automated
140:28 - investigation and response also known as
140:31 - air is a set of security playbooks that
140:33 - can be launched automatically start an
140:35 - automatic investigation provide detailed
140:37 - reports recommend Action Security teams
140:39 - can approve there's a tax simulator you
140:42 - can run realistic attack scenarios in
140:44 - your organization to identify for
140:45 - vulnerabilities so you can see that P2
140:48 - is very very good it provides a lot of
140:51 - great features here's a bit more detail
140:53 - on the EOP so once again it's a
140:55 - cloud-based filtering service that
140:57 - protects your organization from spam
140:58 - malware and other email threats here is
141:01 - a graphic displaying how it works in all
141:03 - the processes it undergoes and so EOP
141:05 - has features for anti-malware inbound
141:08 - anti-spam how about anti-spam connection
141:10 - filtering anti-fishing anti-spoofing
141:13 - protection 0 zero hour auto Purge for
141:15 - delivered malware spam and phishing
141:18 - messages preset security policies tenant
141:20 - allow in block list allow block lists
141:23 - for message senders directory base Edge
141:25 - blocking mail flow rules accepted
141:27 - domains message training and more
141:29 - another important thing to know is that
141:31 - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is
141:34 - included in the Microsoft 365e5 Office
141:37 - 365 E5 and A5 and Microsoft 365 business
141:41 - premium subscriptions so you can see
141:44 - there's a lot of features and I just
141:45 - couldn't fit them all on the screen but
141:47 - I just wanted to show you how valuable
141:49 - exchange online protection is and this
141:51 - is one of the many advantages it has
141:52 - over Gmail
141:53 - [Music]
141:57 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
142:00 - and we're taking a look at the Microsoft
142:01 - Defender portal so we've said before
142:04 - that Microsoft 365 Defender natively
142:06 - coordinates detection prevention
142:08 - investigation and response across
142:10 - endpoints identities email and
142:12 - applications to provide integrated
142:14 - protection against sophisticated attacks
142:16 - while the Microsoft 365 Defender portal
142:19 - brings all of those functionalities
142:21 - together into one place focusing on
142:23 - getting quick access to information and
142:25 - providing simple layouts to meet the
142:26 - needs of security teams you can view the
142:29 - security health of your organization
142:30 - through the Microsoft 365 Defender
142:32 - portal some of the key features of the
142:34 - Microsoft 365 Defender portal include
142:37 - incidents and alerts which create alerts
142:39 - when they detect a suspicious or
142:41 - malicious event or activity threat
142:43 - analytics designed to assist security
142:44 - teams track and respond to emerging
142:46 - threats the secure score which is a
142:48 - representation of a company's security
142:50 - posture and will be going more into
142:52 - detail about it later Learning Hub which
142:54 - provides official guidance from
142:56 - resources like Microsoft security Block
142:58 - in the official documentation and
143:00 - reports which can be a general security
143:02 - report and Branch into specific reports
143:04 - about in points email and collaboration
143:06 - so the Microsoft 365 Defender portal
143:10 - home page shows many of the common cards
143:12 - that security teams need the card and
143:14 - data composition is determined by the
143:15 - user's role different roles will see
143:17 - cards that are more relevant to their
143:19 - day-to-day jobs because the Microsoft
143:20 - 365 Defender portal uses role-based
143:23 - access restriction the cards fall into
143:26 - these categories identities monitor the
143:28 - identities in your organization and keep
143:30 - track of suspicious or risky behaviors
143:32 - data help track user activity that could
143:34 - lead to unauthorized data disclosure
143:36 - devices get up-to-date information on
143:39 - alerts for each activity and other
143:41 - threats on your devices apps gain
143:43 - insight into how Cloud apps are being
143:44 - used in your organization so that's
143:47 - Microsoft Defender portal
143:48 - [Music]
143:52 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
143:55 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft
143:56 - Defender for cloud apps which is a cloud
143:58 - access security broker that sits between
144:00 - the user and the cloud service provider
144:02 - to gatekeep access in real time to Cloud
144:04 - resources Microsoft Defender for cloud
144:06 - apps is built on a framework that
144:08 - follows four principles the first one is
144:10 - discover and control the use of Shadow
144:12 - it identify the cloud apps and iOS and
144:15 - pass Services used by your organization
144:17 - investigate usage patterns assess the
144:19 - risk levels and business Readiness of
144:21 - more than twenty five thousand PSIs apps
144:23 - against more than 80 risks then we have
144:25 - protect against cyber threats and
144:27 - anomalies detect unusual behavior across
144:29 - Cloud apps to identify ransomware
144:31 - compromised users or Rogue applications
144:33 - analyze high risk usage and remediate
144:36 - automatically to limit the risk to your
144:37 - organization then there's protect your
144:39 - sensitive information anywhere in the
144:41 - cloud understand classify and protect
144:43 - the exposure of sensitive information at
144:45 - rest leverage out of the box policies
144:48 - and automated processes to apply
144:49 - controls in real time across all your
144:51 - Cloud apps and then we have assessed the
144:53 - compliance of your Cloud apps assess if
144:55 - your Cloud apps meet relevant compliance
144:57 - requirements including Regulatory
144:59 - Compliance and Industry standards
145:00 - prevent data leaks to non-compliant apps
145:03 - and limit access to regulated data so
145:05 - let's look at the architecture of
145:07 - Defender for cloud apps and some of the
145:08 - functionalities Microsoft Defender for
145:11 - cloud apps integrates visibility with
145:13 - your Cloud by using Cloud Discovery to
145:15 - map and identify your Cloud environment
145:17 - and the cloud apps your organization is
145:18 - using sanctioning and unsanctioning apps
145:21 - in your Cloud using easy to deploy app
145:23 - connectors that take advantage of
145:24 - provider apis for visibility and
145:26 - governance of apps that you connect to
145:28 - using conditional access app control
145:30 - protection to get real-time visibility
145:32 - and control over access and activities
145:34 - within your Cloud apps helping you have
145:36 - continuous control by setting and then
145:38 - continually fine-tuning policies so
145:40 - that's Microsoft Defender for cloud apps
145:43 - [Music]
145:47 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
145:49 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft
145:51 - secure score So within Microsoft 365
145:54 - Defender you get a secure score and this
145:56 - is a representation of your
145:57 - organization's security posture and your
146:00 - opportunity to improve it through
146:01 - Improvement actions this is similar to
146:03 - Azure defender's secure score but they
146:05 - have slightly different terminology to
146:07 - make it a little more company friendly
146:09 - towards people that are developers so on
146:11 - the right here you are given a secure
146:13 - score which is currently at 18.25
146:15 - percent and of course the higher the
146:17 - score the better your protection and
146:19 - then you see the Improvement actions
146:21 - which shows you all the actions you can
146:23 - perform to increase your secure score to
146:24 - improve your organization's security
146:26 - posture so organizations can monitor and
146:29 - work on the security of their Microsoft
146:31 - 365 identities apps and devices from a
146:34 - centralized dashboard via the Microsoft
146:36 - 365 Defender portal secure score helps
146:39 - organizations report on the current
146:41 - state of their security posture improve
146:43 - their security posture by providing
146:45 - discoverability visibility guidance and
146:48 - control compare benchmarks and establish
146:50 - key performance indicators currently
146:52 - Microsoft's secure score supports
146:54 - recommendations for Microsoft 365
146:56 - including exchange online Azure active
146:59 - directory Microsoft Defender for
147:00 - endpoint Microsoft Defender for identity
147:03 - Microsoft Defender Cloud apps and
147:05 - Microsoft teams also new recommendations
147:08 - are being added to secure score all the
147:10 - time so that's Microsoft's secure score
147:12 - [Music]
147:16 - this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and
147:19 - we'll be talking about Microsoft 365
147:21 - security reports So within Microsoft 365
147:25 - you have security reports and these are
147:27 - General Security dashboards about
147:28 - security trends for Microsoft 365
147:31 - identities device and apps information
147:33 - is organized into cards on the dashboard
147:36 - so you have identities where we'll have
147:38 - users at risk in global admins then you
147:40 - have devices so devices at risk device
147:43 - compliance devices with active malware
147:45 - types of malware on devices malware on
147:48 - devices devices with malware detection
147:50 - and users with malware detections then
147:53 - you have apps which have risk levels and
147:55 - so all of this information can be
147:57 - reorganized or grouped into category or
147:58 - topic so right now we have identities
148:01 - devices and apps for the topics we could
148:04 - have risk detection threads and
148:06 - configuration and health so just to kind
148:09 - of tell you a little bit more here
148:10 - imagine you have a bunch of these cards
148:12 - and they're broken down by all these
148:14 - categories here so you can have a bird's
148:16 - eye view of what's going on on one
148:17 - particular report that is interesting to
148:19 - show you is the Office 365 exchange
148:21 - which is a mail server so this provides
148:24 - email collaboration reports it gives you
148:26 - Statistics over time if you were to
148:28 - drill down into a particular type of
148:30 - report here you can kind of see things
148:31 - like spoof detections spam detections
148:34 - over time and things like that so that
148:37 - security reports
148:38 - [Music]
148:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
148:44 - and we'll be talking about common
148:46 - threats before we talk about the common
148:48 - threats we need to know what our
148:49 - vulnerabilities so a vulnerability as a
148:52 - whole or a potential weakness in the
148:54 - application which can be a design flaw
148:56 - or an implementation bug that allows an
148:58 - attacker to infiltrate an organization
148:59 - or cause harm to the stakeholders of an
149:01 - application now that leads us to threats
149:04 - a threat in Cloud security is a
149:06 - potential negative action or event
149:07 - facilitated by a vulnerability that
149:09 - results in an unwanted impact to a
149:11 - computer system or application attackers
149:13 - will create threats across multiple
149:15 - domains like email identity and points
149:17 - and applications to find a point of
149:19 - lease resistance today's defense
149:21 - Solutions have been designed to protect
149:22 - detect and block threats for each domain
149:25 - separately allow the attackers to
149:27 - exploit the seams and threshold
149:28 - differences between Solutions leaving
149:30 - the business vulnerable to attack so now
149:32 - we'll be talking about the most common
149:34 - threats Microsoft wants to focus on
149:36 - credential theft is a type of cyber
149:38 - crime that involves stealing a victim's
149:39 - proof of identity examples of credential
149:42 - theft or mimikatz password spray or
149:44 - breach harvesting malware also known as
149:47 - malicious software is a file or code
149:49 - typically delivered over a network that
149:51 - infects explores steals or conducts
149:54 - virtually any Behavior an attacker wants
149:55 - examples of malware are viruses
149:57 - ransomware and adware phishing attacks
150:00 - use tricks or lures to get a user to
150:02 - reveal credentials or pay money
150:03 - typically by getting them to click a
150:05 - link to a fake website in an email that
150:07 - appears genuine examples of phishing
150:09 - attacks are email phishing and spear
150:11 - fishing infrastructure attacks include
150:13 - improperly secured virtual machines and
150:15 - resources in Azure examples of
150:17 - infrastructure attacks include dos and
150:19 - DDOS attacks so these are the common
150:21 - threats that Microsoft wants you to be
150:23 - familiar with there's definitely more
150:25 - than just four types but these are the
150:26 - main ones that Microsoft wants to focus
150:28 - on
150:29 - [Music]
150:33 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
150:35 - and we'll be taking a look at how
150:37 - Microsoft addresses the most common
150:38 - threats so we'll be talking about
150:40 - Microsoft 365 Defender and how it
150:42 - protects us from potential threats and
150:44 - vulnerabilities this may seem like a
150:46 - review for you but it's great to note
150:48 - nonetheless Microsoft 365 Defender is an
150:51 - integrated cross-domain threat detection
150:53 - and response solution that provides
150:55 - organizations with the ability to
150:56 - prevent detect investigate and remediate
150:59 - sophisticated cross-domain attacks
151:01 - within their Microsoft 365 environments
151:03 - it leverages raw signal data from
151:05 - Individual service domains like user
151:07 - identity and points applications email
151:10 - and collaboration tools normalizing the
151:12 - data at the ingestion Point Microsoft
151:14 - 365 Defender requires no specific
151:17 - expertise or customization so Defenders
151:19 - can immediately use the integrated
151:21 - console and combine incident views with
151:23 - Microsoft 365 Defender security teams
151:26 - can automatically block attacks and
151:28 - eliminate their persistence to keep them
151:30 - from starting again prioritize incidents
151:32 - investigation in response Auto heal
151:35 - assets Focus unique expertise on Cross
151:37 - domain hunting Microsoft 365 Defender
151:40 - Suite protects and points with Microsoft
151:42 - Defender for endpoint a unified endpoint
151:44 - platform for preventative protection
151:46 - post breach detection automated
151:48 - investigation and response email in
151:51 - collaboration with Microsoft Defender
151:53 - for Office 365 safeguards your
151:55 - organization against malicious threats
151:57 - posed by email messages links and
151:59 - collaboration tools identities with
152:01 - Microsoft Defender for identity and
152:03 - Azure active directory identity
152:05 - protection uses active directory signals
152:08 - to identify detect and investigate
152:10 - Advanced threats compromise identities
152:12 - and malicious Insider actions directed
152:14 - at your organization applications with
152:16 - Microsoft Defender for cloud apps a
152:19 - comprehensive Crosshair solution
152:20 - bringing deep visibility strong data
152:23 - controls and enhanced threat protection
152:24 - to your Cloud apps so these are the main
152:27 - tools and services that Microsoft uses
152:29 - to detect and eliminate any potential
152:30 - threats to your Microsoft 365
152:32 - environment
152:33 - [Music]
152:37 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
152:40 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft
152:41 - Sentinel also known as Azure Sentinel so
152:44 - Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable Cloud
152:46 - native security information and event
152:49 - management so Siem and security
152:51 - orchestration Automation and response
152:54 - Solutions or Microsoft Sentinel delivers
152:56 - intelligent security analytics and
152:58 - threat intelligence across the
152:59 - Enterprise providing a single solution
153:02 - for alert and attack detection threat
153:04 - visibility proactive hunting and threat
153:07 - response so here's a big wheel that
153:09 - Microsoft Sentinel likes to use to
153:10 - describe it and what's cool about this
153:12 - offering is it's both a Siam and a sore
153:15 - so you don't have to have two separate
153:16 - Services starting off with collected so
153:18 - collect data at Cloud scale across all
153:20 - users devices applications and
153:23 - infrastructure both on premise and in
153:25 - multiple clouds detect previously
153:27 - undetected threats and minimize false
153:29 - positives using Microsoft's analytics
153:31 - and unparalleled thread intelligence
153:33 - investigate threats with artificial
153:35 - intelligence and hunt for suspicious
153:36 - activities at scale all tapping into
153:38 - years of cyber security work at
153:40 - Microsoft respond to incidents rapidly
153:42 - with built-in orchestration and
153:44 - automation of common tasks let's take a
153:46 - look at what Microsoft Sentinel can
153:47 - ingest from other data set sources so we
153:50 - have a number of connectors here such as
153:52 - Microsoft 365 Defender Microsoft 365
153:55 - sources including Office 365 Azure ID
153:59 - Microsoft Defender for identity and
154:01 - Microsoft Defender for cloud apps you
154:03 - can also use common event formats such
154:05 - as syslog rest API Windows event logs
154:09 - common event format and trusted
154:11 - automated exchange of indicator
154:12 - information also known as taxii so let's
154:16 - take a look at workbooks and so this is
154:18 - a feature of azure monitor but Microsoft
154:20 - Sentinel allows you to create workbooks
154:22 - really easily after you connected your
154:24 - data sources to Microsoft Sentinel you
154:26 - can monitor the data using the Microsoft
154:28 - Sentinel integration with Azure monitor
154:30 - workbooks workbooks provide a flexible
154:32 - canvas for data analysis and the
154:34 - creation of Rich visual reports they
154:36 - allow you to tap into multiple data data
154:38 - sources and combine them into unified
154:39 - interactive experiences it tells a story
154:42 - about the performance and availability
154:43 - about your applications and services so
154:46 - here's a graph showing the performance
154:48 - analysis and here's another one showing
154:50 - the application failure analysis but the
154:52 - idea is that these are kind of like
154:53 - living documents where you can visualize
154:55 - and monitor specific metrics and other
154:57 - things about your applications and
154:58 - services Microsoft Sentinel allows you
155:01 - to create custom workbooks across your
155:02 - data and also comes with built-in
155:04 - workbook templates to allow you to
155:06 - quickly gain insights across your data
155:07 - as soon as you connect a data source a
155:09 - couple more points here on workbooks is
155:11 - that they are intended for sock
155:12 - engineers and analysts of all tiers to
155:14 - visualize data sock stands for security
155:16 - operations center if you didn't know
155:18 - while workbooks are best used for high
155:20 - level views of Microsoft Sentinel data
155:22 - and require no coding knowledge you
155:24 - cannot integrate workbooks with external
155:26 - data now let's look at the core features
155:28 - of Microsoft Sentinel starting with
155:30 - analytics so Microsoft Sentinel uses
155:33 - analytics to correlate alerts into
155:34 - incidents so over here we can see that
155:37 - we have list them in incidents or groups
155:39 - of related alerts that together create
155:40 - an actionable possible threat that you
155:42 - can investigate and resolve Microsoft
155:44 - Sentinel also provides machine learning
155:46 - rules to map your network behavior and
155:48 - then look for anomalies across your
155:49 - resources then there's Automation and
155:51 - orchestration so with Sentinel you have
155:53 - solutions that provide a highly
155:55 - extensible architecture that enables
155:56 - scalable automation as new technologies
155:58 - and threats emerge Sentinel is built on
156:01 - the foundation of azure logic apps so
156:03 - it's a great way of not having to use
156:04 - any code but you can chain things over
156:06 - different services and they have over
156:08 - 200 connectors for services such as
156:10 - Azure functions the connectors allow you
156:12 - to apply any custom logic and code
156:14 - servicenow jira zendesk HTTP requests
156:18 - Microsoft teams slack Windows Defender
156:20 - at TP and Defender for cloud apps so
156:23 - there's a lot to do there for
156:24 - investigations the investigation tools
156:26 - help you to understand the scope and
156:28 - find the root cause of a potential
156:30 - security threat you can choose an entity
156:32 - on the interactive graph to ask
156:33 - interesting questions for a specific
156:35 - entity and drill down into that entity
156:37 - and its connections to get to the root
156:39 - cause of the threat moving on to hunting
156:41 - so Microsoft sentinel's powerful hunting
156:43 - search and query tools is based on the
156:45 - miter framework which is a curated
156:46 - knowledge base that tracks cyber
156:48 - adversary tactics and techniques so this
156:50 - enables you to proactively hunt for
156:52 - security threats across your
156:53 - organization's data sources before an
156:56 - alert is triggered after you discover
156:57 - which hunting query provides high value
156:59 - insights into possible attacks you can
157:02 - also create custom detection rules based
157:04 - on your query and service those insights
157:06 - as alerts to your security incident
157:07 - responders while hunting you can create
157:10 - bookmarks for interesting events
157:11 - enabling you to return to them later
157:13 - share them with others and group them
157:15 - with other correlating events to create
157:17 - a compelling incident for investigation
157:18 - and on to our final section we'll go
157:21 - over the pricing models of Microsoft
157:22 - Sentinel so the first type is capacity
157:25 - reservations where you are billed a
157:27 - fixed fee base on the selected tier
157:28 - enabling a predictable total cost for
157:30 - Microsoft Sentinel and we have pay as
157:32 - you go so your bill per gigabyte for the
157:34 - volume of data ingested for analysis in
157:36 - Microsoft Sentinel and stored in the
157:38 - Azure monitor log analytics workspace so
157:41 - that's Microsoft Sentinel
157:42 - [Music]
157:47 - Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're
157:49 - going through an overview of the
157:50 - Microsoft 365 Defender we'll be taking a
157:53 - look at only the key features here so in
157:56 - general Microsoft 365 Defender helps
157:58 - respond to threats and manage security
158:00 - across your identities data devices apps
158:03 - and infrastructure so starting with the
158:06 - incidents and alerts section there is
158:08 - currently no data because this is a new
158:09 - account and no alerts have been recorded
158:11 - typically there would be a list of
158:13 - incidents and alerts it would include
158:15 - the incident name a unique ID number the
158:17 - severity of the threat status and
158:19 - displays a summary of the incident and
158:21 - provides access to tabs with additional
158:23 - information one of the key features of
158:25 - the Microsoft 365 Defender is the secure
158:28 - score so the Microsoft secure score is a
158:30 - representation of your organization's
158:32 - security posture and your opportunity to
158:34 - improve it it's similar to how the
158:36 - Microsoft compliance score is designed
158:38 - here it displays the secure score of
158:40 - 28.07 percent for the organization and
158:43 - right next to it shows a list of actions
158:45 - to review it also provides a comparison
158:47 - of your organization's secure score to
158:49 - other organizations that is similarly
158:51 - set up or designed to other
158:52 - organizations with their secure score
158:54 - the next thing we want to do is to click
158:56 - on recommended actions this will
158:58 - populate the list of actions to review
158:59 - so on the list of actions to review we
159:02 - can sort them however we want such as
159:04 - according to their rank score impact
159:06 - points achieved status and so on and
159:09 - once you complete the recommended action
159:10 - it will increase your security score
159:12 - based on the score impact of the action
159:14 - as an example we'll select a simple one
159:16 - such as only invited users should be
159:18 - automatically admitted to teams meetings
159:20 - then we'll click on implementation which
159:22 - are the instructions or guide where to
159:24 - go and how to complete the action so
159:26 - this tells us to go to the Microsoft
159:27 - teams admin Center and in the meeting
159:29 - policies under the participants and
159:31 - guests section toggle automatically
159:33 - admit people to invited users only so
159:35 - we'll click on Microsoft teams admin
159:37 - Center first thing you'll want to do is
159:39 - to navigate to the on meetings pane then
159:41 - click on meeting policies
159:43 - and then on manage policies click on the
159:46 - add button we'll need to give this
159:48 - policy a name so we'll name it invite
159:50 - users only
159:54 - then we'll need to look for the policy
159:56 - mentioned in the implementation
159:59 - after finding the correct section of
160:01 - participants and guests under the
160:03 - automatically admit people will need to
160:05 - toggle and change it to invited users
160:07 - only then click save
160:09 - you can now see that the new policy has
160:11 - been added to the list so that should be
160:13 - completed and you should see the secure
160:15 - score update within 24 hours coming back
160:18 - to the Microsoft secure section there's
160:20 - a tab that displays the history of your
160:22 - Microsoft secure score to see the
160:24 - performance over a period of time if it
160:26 - increases or decreases you can also view
160:29 - metrics and Trends such as comparison
160:31 - Trend regression Trend and risk
160:33 - acceptance Trend that you may be
160:34 - interested in
160:35 - for the reports section there is the
160:38 - general section where you can view
160:39 - information about security Trends and
160:41 - track the protection status of your
160:42 - identities data devices apps and
160:45 - infrastructure there's also the email
160:47 - and collaboration reports where you
160:49 - review Microsoft recommended actions to
160:50 - help improve email and collaboration
160:52 - security and many more but we're not
160:54 - going to go through all of them the
160:56 - audit section should be similar to the
160:57 - one in the Microsoft purview compliance
160:59 - portal so we won't go over too much the
161:02 - last section we'll talk about is the
161:03 - health section and the main thing we
161:05 - want to look at here is service health
161:06 - so here you can view the issues and
161:08 - health status of all services that are
161:10 - available with your current
161:11 - subscriptions you can view info about
161:13 - the history of incidents and advisories
161:15 - that have been resolved and you can
161:17 - track the status of issues reported by
161:19 - people in your organization over the
161:20 - last 30 days so that's a quick overview
161:23 - of the Microsoft 365 Defender
161:26 - [Music]
161:29 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
161:32 - and we're taking a look at Regulatory
161:34 - Compliance so what is compliance it's
161:36 - conforming to a rule such as a
161:38 - specification policy standard or law and
161:41 - Regulatory compliances and organization
161:43 - that takes effort to comply with
161:44 - relevant laws policies and regulations
161:47 - so Regulatory Compliance can vary at the
161:50 - following levels so there's Federal such
161:52 - as Canada there's state or provincial
161:53 - like Ontario political and economic
161:56 - Union like European union and
161:58 - international organization so why do we
162:00 - have Regulatory Compliance well
162:02 - governments want to protect its citizens
162:04 - data that is collected by companies and
162:06 - organizations we don't want the
162:07 - companies or Orcs to mishandle our data
162:09 - or sell our data what are compliance
162:11 - controls well those are internal control
162:13 - mechanisms that need to be in place to
162:15 - detect prevent incorrect compliance
162:17 - issues for example we have public
162:19 - standards and policies documented
162:22 - procedures training monitoring and
162:24 - internal audits so what are some of the
162:27 - measures that Regulatory Compliance can
162:28 - enforce well it allows citizens the
162:31 - right to access their data at any time
162:32 - citizens have the right to correct or
162:34 - delete data if needed it gives us
162:36 - control over the retention periods for
162:38 - the minimum or maximum time data should
162:40 - be stored enabling governments and
162:42 - Regulatory Agencies the right to access
162:43 - and examine data when necessary and
162:46 - defining rules for what data can be
162:47 - processed and how that should be done so
162:50 - that's Regulatory Compliance
162:52 - [Music]
162:55 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
162:58 - and we're taking a look at compliance
163:00 - Solutions in Microsoft 365 which are
163:02 - collections of integrated capabilities
163:04 - you can use to help you manage
163:05 - end-to-end compliance scenarios a
163:07 - Solutions capabilities and tools might
163:09 - include a combination of policies alerts
163:12 - reports and more the solution catalog is
163:15 - organized into sections that contain
163:16 - information cards for each compliance
163:18 - solution available in your Microsoft 365
163:21 - subscription each section contains cards
163:23 - for Solutions grouped by compliance area
163:25 - so you can see on the image here there's
163:27 - the information and protection area
163:29 - Insider risk management Discovery
163:31 - response and so on and within them you
163:34 - have the solution cards like
163:35 - communication compliance when you select
163:37 - view for a solution card you'll see
163:39 - detailed information about the
163:41 - compliance solution and how to get
163:42 - started so we're looking at the
163:44 - communication compliance section and
163:46 - this information includes an overview
163:48 - pre-configuration requirements learning
163:50 - resources controls that allow you to pin
163:52 - the car to the navigation Pane and an
163:54 - option to share the solution as a Link
163:56 - email or Microsoft teams message to view
163:59 - the Microsoft purview solution catalog
164:01 - go to
164:02 - compliance.microsoft.com and sign in as
164:04 - a global administrator compliance
164:06 - administrator or compliance data
164:08 - administrator select catalog in the
164:10 - navigation pane on the left side of the
164:12 - screen to open the catalog home page so
164:14 - that's the compliance Solutions in
164:16 - Microsoft 365.
164:18 - [Music]
164:21 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
164:24 - and we'll be talking about the service
164:25 - trust portal so the Microsoft service
164:28 - trust portal provides a variety of
164:30 - content tools and other resources about
164:32 - Microsoft security privacy and
164:35 - compliance practices from the main menu
164:37 - you can access the service trust portal
164:39 - compliancemanager trust documents
164:41 - Industries and regions trust Center
164:43 - Resources by library and more and we'll
164:47 - briefly go over what each section has to
164:48 - offer in the next slide so the service
164:50 - trust portal provides a quick way to get
164:52 - back to the home page for the service
164:54 - trust portal to compliance manager
164:56 - directs users to compliance manager in
164:58 - the Microsoft purview compliance portal
165:00 - to access to compliance manager and
165:02 - other compliance management capabilities
165:04 - in Microsoft 365. we'll talk a bit more
165:07 - about this later on trust documents
165:09 - provides a wealth of security
165:10 - implementation and design information
165:12 - with the goal of making it easier for
165:14 - organizations to meet Regulatory
165:15 - Compliance objectives so with interest
165:18 - documents there are audit reports which
165:19 - provide a list of independent audit and
165:21 - assessment reports on Microsoft's cloud
165:23 - services is displayed data protection
165:25 - contains a wealth of resources such as
165:27 - audited controls white papers FAQs
165:30 - penetration tests risk assessment tools
165:32 - and compliance guides Azure stack
165:34 - contains documents that provide security
165:36 - and compliance Solutions and support
165:38 - tailored to the needs of azure stack
165:40 - customers Industries and regions
165:42 - provides access to compliance
165:43 - information about Microsoft cloud
165:45 - services organized by industry and
165:47 - region you can access the industry
165:49 - Solutions which directs users to the
165:51 - landing page for the financial services
165:52 - industry containing information such as
165:55 - compliance offerings FAQs and success
165:58 - stories and there's Regional Solutions
165:59 - which provide documents on Microsoft
166:01 - cloud services compliance with the laws
166:04 - of various countries regions including
166:06 - Australia Canada Czech Republic Denmark
166:09 - Germany Poland Romania Spain and the
166:12 - United Kingdom trust Center links you to
166:14 - the Microsoft trust Center which
166:15 - provides more information about privacy
166:17 - security and compliance in the Microsoft
166:20 - cloud resources provide links to
166:22 - security and compliance for Office 365
166:25 - the Microsoft global data centers and
166:28 - FAQs and my library is a feature that
166:30 - lets you save documents so that you can
166:32 - quickly access them on your my library
166:33 - page taking a closer look at audit
166:36 - reports and so audit reports are
166:38 - independent audit reports for
166:39 - Microsoft's cloud services which provide
166:41 - information about compliance with data
166:43 - protection standards and regulatory
166:45 - requirements so you'll get audit reports
166:47 - for it International Organization for
166:49 - standardization service organization
166:51 - controls National Institute of Standards
166:54 - and Technology Federal risk and
166:56 - authorization Management program and
166:58 - general data protection regulation so
167:00 - you'll get a list of documents and PDFs
167:02 - that you can download you can open them
167:04 - up and see how Microsoft and Azure are
167:05 - being compliant and just taking a closer
167:07 - look at Regional Solutions in the
167:09 - industries and regions section so as we
167:12 - mentioned before Regional Solutions
167:13 - provide documents on Microsoft's
167:15 - compliance policies and regulations for
167:17 - Regions such as Australia Germany UK and
167:20 - many more and so here here you can
167:22 - select the regions that are available
167:23 - and in this example it's United Kingdom
167:26 - and here you can look at the GRC
167:27 - assessment reports their description and
167:29 - you can download them for a closer
167:31 - inspection so that's the service trust
167:33 - portal
167:34 - [Music]
167:38 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
167:40 - and we're taking a look at compliance
167:42 - Concepts focusing on data residency and
167:44 - how it helps ensure Regulatory
167:46 - Compliance so as organizations and
167:48 - institutions move their data to service
167:50 - provider clouds with data centers all
167:52 - over the world government agencies and
167:54 - Industry groups have issued regulations
167:56 - to help protect and govern the use of
167:58 - data organizations can be accountable
168:00 - for meeting dozens of regulations
168:01 - ranging from personal and financial
168:03 - information to data protection and
168:05 - privacy so when it comes to compliance
168:08 - data residency regulations govern the
168:10 - physical locations where data can be
168:12 - stored as well as how and when it can be
168:13 - transferred processed or accessed
168:16 - internationally these regulations can
168:18 - differ significantly depending on
168:20 - jurisdiction it ensures customers can
168:22 - access diagnostic service generated and
168:25 - support data and can manage access to
168:27 - their own data Microsoft protects
168:29 - customer data from unauthorized access
168:31 - and handles challenges from government
168:32 - requests and other third-party orders it
168:35 - provides tools customers can use to
168:37 - restrict protect and encrypt data at
168:39 - rest in transit and in some cases in use
168:42 - it enforces strict policies and
168:44 - practices that Microsoft follows for the
168:46 - retention and deletion of customer data
168:48 - Microsoft also ensures compliance with
168:50 - privacy regulations and standards to
168:52 - help protect the privacy of customer
168:53 - data so here are some important Concepts
168:56 - and terms that relate to data compliance
168:58 - that you may need to know data
169:00 - sovereignty is the concept that data
169:01 - particularly personal data is subject to
169:04 - the laws and regulations of the country
169:05 - region in which it's physically
169:07 - collected held or processed this can
169:10 - complicate compliance because the same
169:11 - piece of data can be collected in one
169:13 - location stored in another and processed
169:15 - in another making it subject to laws
169:17 - from different countries and regions and
169:19 - data privacy is providing notice and
169:21 - being transparent about the collection
169:23 - processing use and sharing of personal
169:25 - data are fundamental principles of
169:27 - privacy laws and regulations personal
169:29 - data means any information relating to
169:31 - an identified or identifiable natural
169:33 - person privacy laws previously
169:35 - referenced Pi or personally identifiable
169:37 - info information but the laws have
169:39 - expanded the definition to any data that
169:41 - is directly linked or indirectly
169:42 - linkable back to a person organizations
169:45 - are subject to and must operate
169:47 - consistent with a multitude of laws
169:49 - regulations codes of conduct
169:51 - industry-specific standards and
169:53 - compliance standards governing data
169:55 - privacy so those are the compliance
169:57 - Concepts
169:58 - [Music]
170:01 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
170:04 - and we're talking about Microsoft
170:05 - purview information protection also
170:08 - known as Microsoft information
170:09 - protection and this is a collection of
170:11 - features within Microsoft purview
170:13 - formerly Microsoft 365 compliance to
170:16 - help you discover classify and protect
170:18 - sensitive information wherever it lives
170:20 - or travels so the idea here is that we
170:23 - have this diagram and we have four
170:24 - specific domains that are information
170:26 - protection capabilities around our data
170:28 - and so the first is know your data the
170:30 - second is protect your data the third is
170:32 - prevent data loss and the fourth is
170:34 - govern your data so we'll be going over
170:37 - all these sections in the next few
170:38 - slides taking a look at the four domains
170:40 - here for the Microsoft purview
170:41 - information protection these are
170:43 - features found within Microsoft purview
170:45 - so the first is know your data
170:47 - understand your data landscape and
170:49 - identify important data across your
170:51 - hybrid environment so one feature would
170:53 - be sensitive information types this
170:55 - identifies sensitive data by using
170:57 - built-in or custom regular expressions
170:58 - or a function it provides corroborative
171:01 - evidence includes key words confidence
171:03 - levels and proximity we have built-in
171:05 - sensitive labels and you have custom
171:07 - ones as well so then there's trainable
171:09 - classifiers this identifies sensitive
171:12 - data by using examples of the data
171:13 - you're interested in rather than
171:14 - identifying elements in the item so
171:17 - pattern matching and you can use
171:18 - built-in classifiers or train a
171:20 - classifier with your own content say you
171:22 - have trainable classifiers here for data
171:24 - classification this is a graphical
171:26 - identification of items in your
171:28 - organization that have a sensitive label
171:30 - a retention label or have been
171:32 - classified you can also use this
171:34 - information to gain insights into the
171:35 - actions that your users are taking on
171:37 - these items so that's the context
171:39 - Explorer and the activity Explorer the
171:41 - second part is protect your data so
171:43 - apply flexible protection actions that
171:45 - include encryption access restrictions
171:47 - and visual markings say you have
171:50 - sensitivity labels Azure information
171:51 - protection unified labeling client
171:54 - double key encryption Office 365 message
171:57 - encryption service encryption with
171:59 - customer key SharePoint information
172:01 - rights manager Rights Management
172:03 - connector Azure information protection
172:05 - unified labeling scanner Microsoft
172:07 - Defender for cloud apps and Microsoft
172:09 - information protection SDK most of these
172:12 - you won't need to know but will
172:13 - definitely cover sensitivity labels then
172:15 - we have prevent data loss so this
172:17 - prevents accidental oversharing of
172:19 - sensitive information here you have
172:21 - Microsoft purview data loss prevention
172:23 - and point data loss prevention Microsoft
172:25 - compliance extension there's a Chrome
172:27 - extension that does compliance for you
172:29 - so it's built in your browser there's
172:31 - the Microsoft purview data loss
172:32 - prevention on premises scanner and
172:34 - protects sensitive information in
172:36 - Microsoft teams chat and channel
172:37 - messages we'll definitely take a closer
172:40 - look at Microsoft purview data loss
172:42 - prevention later next we have Microsoft
172:44 - purview data lifecycle management
172:45 - formerly Microsoft information
172:47 - governance which is a collection of
172:49 - features to govern your data for
172:51 - compliance or regulatory so for
172:53 - Microsoft purview data lifecycle
172:54 - management it keeps what you need and
172:56 - deletes what you don't we have retention
172:58 - policies and retention labels inactive
173:01 - mailboxes archive mailboxes import
173:03 - service for PSD files and for Microsoft
173:06 - purview records management it manages
173:08 - high value items for business legal or
173:11 - regulatory record-keeping requirements
173:13 - you have file plan retention labels for
173:15 - individual items retention policies if
173:18 - needed for Baseline retention and
173:20 - disposition review and proof of
173:21 - disposition so those are the four
173:23 - domains in Microsoft purview information
173:25 - protection govern your data is not
173:27 - technically part of it as it's in the
173:29 - data life cycle and record section but I
173:31 - included it anyways
173:32 - [Music]
173:36 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
173:38 - and we're taking a look at the data
173:40 - classification capabilities so sensitive
173:43 - information types or classifications or
173:45 - categories of data by sensitivity they
173:47 - are pattern-based classifiers and they
173:49 - have set patterns that can be used to
173:50 - identify them so within the Microsoft
173:52 - purview data classification feature you
173:55 - can get a breakdown of the distribution
173:56 - of sensitive info types so here imagine
173:59 - you have a bunch of documents and you
174:00 - said hey tell me what you found in these
174:02 - documents and there it gives it kind of
174:04 - a breakdown by type these types are
174:06 - identified based on regular expression
174:08 - or a function there are hundreds of
174:09 - built-in information types for example
174:12 - credit card numbers passport or
174:14 - identification numbers bank account
174:16 - numbers Health Service numbers IP
174:18 - addresses Azure storage account keys and
174:20 - driver's license numbers so it's a huge
174:23 - list and so here's a list of some
174:25 - sensitive info types these sensitive
174:27 - information types are used in data loss
174:29 - prevention policies sensitivity labels
174:32 - retention labels Insider risk management
174:34 - communication compliance and auto
174:37 - labeling policies generally the first
174:39 - thing you're going to do with your data
174:40 - classification is to get your sensitive
174:42 - information types and you can create
174:44 - your own info types too so if there's
174:46 - something that doesn't meet your needs
174:47 - you'll have to write your own regular
174:49 - expression but you can have whatever you
174:51 - want another feature found in data
174:53 - classification within Microsoft
174:54 - purviewer trainable classifiers let's
174:56 - talk about what training is and
174:58 - classifiers are so a classifier is a
175:00 - machine learning model that can take
175:01 - records of data and classify or
175:03 - categorize by applying a label from a
175:05 - predetermined list of categories then
175:07 - you have training and this is the act of
175:09 - teaching a machine learning model how to
175:10 - learn by providing it large amounts of
175:12 - data that is already labeled it uses the
175:14 - label data to tell if its predictions
175:16 - are similar to the ones provided So
175:18 - within Microsoft purview it has two
175:20 - kinds of trainable classifiers three
175:22 - train classifiers are ready to use
175:23 - classifiers with five portraying
175:25 - classifiers we'll talk about those five
175:27 - in a moment you don't need to provide
175:29 - any data used for training and it meets
175:31 - many General use cases then you have
175:33 - custom tradable classifiers this is when
175:35 - you have your own kind of documents when
175:37 - you have specific business documents but
175:39 - you'll have to provide training data so
175:41 - the five pre-trained classifiers or
175:43 - resumes source code harassment profanity
175:45 - and threat another feature in the data
175:47 - classification within Microsoft purview
175:49 - is content Explorer so this enables
175:52 - administrators to gain visibility into
175:54 - the content that has been summarized in
175:55 - the overview pane it drills down to find
175:57 - emails or documents that have been
175:59 - labeled based on sensitive information
176:01 - types sensitivity labels or retention
176:03 - labels there are two roles that Grant
176:06 - access to content Explorer you have
176:07 - content Explorer list viewer and content
176:10 - Explorer content viewer so the idea here
176:12 - is you have broad categories on left
176:14 - hand side so you see the three
176:15 - categories sensitive info types
176:17 - sensitivity labels and retention labels
176:20 - and then what you'll do is Click into
176:22 - one and then they'll have specific
176:23 - actual items underneath and you click
176:25 - into one of those and then from there
176:27 - you can go on the right hand pane over
176:28 - here you can go and explore different
176:30 - documents and files to identify that
176:32 - kind of information the other Explorer
176:34 - here is the activity Explorer and this
176:36 - helps discover which file labels were
176:38 - changed and which files were modified so
176:41 - it monitors label activity across
176:42 - exchange SharePoint OneDrive and
176:44 - endpoint devices a few activity types
176:47 - that can be analyzed are file copied to
176:49 - removable media file copy to network
176:51 - share label applied and label change and
176:54 - admins can use more than 30 filters for
176:56 - data including location user sensitivity
176:59 - label and retention label so here is a
177:02 - great visual to help you get the idea so
177:04 - here you have filters so activity
177:06 - location user and the type of
177:08 - sensitivity label and then you can see
177:10 - it says label changed here in light blue
177:12 - and you can see these labels were
177:14 - applied in a darker tone of blue and
177:16 - files copied to the cloud in dark orange
177:18 - so it represents the amount of files or
177:20 - labels according to the visual so it
177:22 - helps you get an idea of what this does
177:24 - [Music]
177:28 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
177:30 - and we're taking a look at sensitivity
177:32 - labels so sensitivity labels allow you
177:35 - to apply a label to your documents or
177:37 - emails and the most common way is
177:38 - through built-in drop down within Office
177:40 - 365 products so labels are customizable
177:44 - admins can create different categories
177:46 - specific to the organization such as
177:48 - personal public confidential and highly
177:51 - confidential they are clear text because
177:53 - each label is stored in clear text in
177:55 - the contents metadata third-party apps
177:57 - and services can read it and then apply
177:59 - their own protective actions if
178:01 - necessary and they're persistent when
178:03 - you apply a sensitivity label to content
178:05 - the label is stored in the email or
178:07 - document's metadata the label follows
178:09 - the content including the protection
178:11 - settings and this data is used to apply
178:13 - and enforce policies so here we have an
178:15 - example for Microsoft Word one for Excel
178:18 - and here's one from Outlook the idea is
178:20 - that you do your business as per usual
178:21 - but you have to go ahead and classify
178:23 - that information into a particular
178:25 - sensitivity so sensitivity labeling
178:27 - makes it easy to apply content marketing
178:29 - or encryption content markings would be
178:31 - like watermarks warnings that are
178:33 - applied to the header and footer of a
178:34 - document so notice here you can turn it
178:37 - on and you can say add this watermark
178:38 - with this customized text at this header
178:41 - at this footer I think you can even
178:42 - customize some of the colors but are
178:44 - very limited but it does the job the
178:46 - other one is encryption so apply
178:48 - encryption and specify which users and
178:50 - groups May decrypt and other fine-tuned
178:52 - permissions so the idea is you would
178:54 - turn the encryption on then you would
178:55 - select the users groups Etc who could do
178:58 - it then they have these broad categories
179:00 - and so this particular one is for email
179:02 - but here you choose which permissions
179:04 - are allowed so are you allowed to view
179:06 - the content can you save the email are
179:08 - you allowed to reply to the email are
179:10 - you allowed to forward the email so it's
179:12 - very fine-tuned it's not just encryption
179:14 - even though that's what it is so within
179:16 - Microsoft purview under classification
179:18 - you can see the distribution of
179:20 - sensitive labels applied to documents
179:21 - and emails or based on location so this
179:24 - gives you a visual to help you
179:25 - understand where these labels are
179:26 - located on the left hand side shows what
179:29 - sensitivity labels have been applied to
179:30 - the content and then on the right here
179:32 - it shows the location of where
179:34 - sensitivity labels are applied so
179:36 - sensitivity labels can be used to
179:38 - provide protection settings that include
179:40 - encryption and content markings protect
179:42 - content in office apps across different
179:44 - platforms and devices protect content in
179:47 - third-party apps and services protect
179:49 - containers extend sensitivity labels to
179:51 - power bi extend sensitivity labels to
179:54 - assets in Azure extend sensitivity
179:56 - labels to third-party apps and services
179:58 - and classify content without using any
180:00 - protection settings so that sensitivity
180:03 - labels
180:03 - [Music]
180:07 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
180:10 - and we're taking a look at label
180:11 - policies so in order to use sensitivity
180:13 - labels they need to be published
180:15 - alongside a label policy a label policy
180:18 - determines who can use the label and
180:19 - other conditions so the idea here is you
180:21 - can specify which users or groups can
180:23 - use these labels and then here are some
180:25 - of the settings here so notice below
180:27 - users must provide justification to
180:29 - remove a label or lower classification
180:31 - requires users to apply a label to their
180:34 - email or document provides user with a
180:36 - link to a custom help page so label
180:38 - policies enable admins to choose the
180:40 - users and groups that can see labels so
180:42 - labels can be published of specific
180:44 - user's distribution groups Microsoft 365
180:48 - groups and Azure ID and more apply a
180:50 - default label to all new emails and
180:52 - documents that the specified users and
180:54 - groups create users can always change
180:56 - the default label if they believe the
180:57 - document or email has been dislabeled
180:59 - required justifications for label
181:01 - changes so if a user wants to remove a
181:03 - label or replace it admins can require
181:05 - the user to provide a valid
181:07 - justification to to complete the action
181:08 - the user will be prompted to provide an
181:10 - explanation for why the label should be
181:12 - changed require users to apply a label
181:14 - so mandatory labeling ensures a label is
181:17 - applied before users can save their
181:18 - documents send emails or create new
181:21 - sites or groups and we have link users
181:23 - to custom help Pages it helps users to
181:25 - understand what the different labels
181:27 - mean and how they should be used so
181:29 - those are the sensitivity label policies
181:31 - [Music]
181:35 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
181:37 - and we're taking a look at retention
181:39 - policies and labels so retention labels
181:42 - and policies help organizations to
181:43 - manage and govern information by
181:45 - ensuring content is kept only for a
181:47 - required time and then permanently
181:49 - deleted apply retention labels and
181:51 - assigning retention policies helps
181:53 - organizations comply proactively with
181:55 - industry regulations and internal
181:57 - policies that require content to be kept
181:59 - for a minimum time reduce risk when
182:01 - there's litigation or a security breach
182:02 - by permanently deleting old content that
182:04 - the organization is no longer required
182:06 - to keep and it ensures users work only
182:08 - with content that's current and relevant
182:10 - to them when content has retention
182:12 - settings assigned to it that content
182:14 - remains in its original location so
182:16 - retention settings work with the
182:17 - following different workloads SharePoint
182:19 - in OneDrive Microsoft teams jabber at
182:22 - exchange so retention labels ensures
182:25 - data is held for a specific duration to
182:27 - meet a Regulatory Compliance or industry
182:29 - best practices they are used to assign
182:31 - retention settings at an item level such
182:33 - as a folder document or email an email
182:36 - or document can have only a single
182:37 - retention label assigned to it at a time
182:39 - so here you see the retention labels
182:41 - applied to the which content retention
182:43 - policies are used to assign the same
182:45 - retention settings to content at a site
182:47 - level or mailbox level a single policy
182:49 - can be applied to multiple locations or
182:51 - to specific locations or users items
182:54 - inherit the retention settings from
182:55 - their containers specified in the
182:57 - retention policy and here you can see
182:59 - the locations where the retention labels
183:00 - are applied so this is similar to how
183:02 - the sensitivity labels work
183:05 - foreign
183:08 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
183:10 - and we're talking about records
183:12 - management so what is records management
183:14 - it's an organization's process of
183:16 - managing an organization's information
183:18 - throughout its life cycle record
183:20 - management helps organization meeting
183:22 - Regulatory Compliance or legal
183:24 - requirements so a life cycle of a record
183:26 - would look something like this it begins
183:28 - with identifying then classifying
183:30 - storing securing retrieving tracking
183:33 - destroying and ends with preserving a
183:36 - record represents labeled information or
183:38 - content and its life cycle will be
183:39 - managed so Microsoft purview records
183:42 - management includes many features
183:43 - including labeling content as a record
183:46 - migrating and managing retention plans
183:48 - with file plan manager establishing
183:50 - retention and deletion policies within
183:52 - the record label triggering event-based
183:54 - retention reviewing and validating
183:56 - disposition proof of Records deletion
183:58 - exporting information about disposed
184:01 - items and setting specific permissions
184:03 - for record manager functions in the
184:04 - organization label content applies the
184:07 - following controls risk restrictions are
184:09 - put in place to block certain activities
184:11 - activities are logged and proof of
184:13 - disposition is kept at the end of the
184:15 - retention period so that's records
184:17 - management
184:18 - [Music]
184:22 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
184:24 - and we're taking a look at data loss
184:26 - prevention so organizations need to
184:28 - prevent data loss by detecting risky
184:30 - behavior and preventing the improper
184:32 - sharing of sensitive information
184:33 - Microsoft purview data loss prevention
184:35 - so DLP is a way to protect sensitive
184:38 - information and prevent its
184:39 - unintentional disclosure with DLP
184:41 - policies admins can identify Monitor and
184:45 - automatically protect sensitive
184:46 - information across Microsoft 365
184:49 - including OneDrive for business
184:51 - SharePoint online Microsoft teams and
184:54 - exchange online help users learn how
184:56 - compliance Works without interrupting
184:58 - their workflow admins can also view DLP
185:00 - reports showing content that matches the
185:02 - organization's DLP policies so DLP
185:05 - policies are composed of conditions that
185:07 - the content must match before the rule
185:09 - is enforced actions that the admin wants
185:11 - the rule to take automatically when
185:13 - content that matches the conditions has
185:15 - been found and locations where the
185:17 - policy will be applied so a policy can
185:19 - contain one or more rules and each rule
185:21 - consists of conditions and actions at a
185:23 - minimum for each rule when the
185:25 - conditions are met the actions are taken
185:27 - automatically rules can be grouped into
185:29 - one policy to help simplify management
185:31 - and Reporting so here's a diagram that
185:33 - shows how multiple rules each with their
185:35 - own conditions and actions are grouped
185:37 - into a single policy so we have multiple
185:39 - rules here rule one rule two Rule n Etc
185:42 - and each of them have their own
185:44 - conditions and actions and it's all
185:46 - grouped into a single policy moving on
185:48 - to inpoint data loss prevention so this
185:50 - extends the activity monitoring and
185:52 - protection capabilities of DLP to
185:54 - sensitive items that are physically
185:55 - stored on Windows 10 Windows 11 and Mac
185:58 - OS devices and point DLP enables admins
186:01 - to audit and manage activities that
186:03 - users complete on sensitive content so
186:05 - DLP capabilities have been extended to
186:07 - Microsoft teams chat and channel
186:08 - messages including messages in private
186:11 - channels and with DLP administrators can
186:14 - now Define policies that prevent users
186:16 - from sharing sensitive information in a
186:18 - team's chat session or Channel whether
186:20 - it's in a message or a file so so that's
186:22 - DLP
186:23 - [Music]
186:27 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
186:29 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft
186:31 - purview compliance portal also known as
186:33 - Microsoft 365 compliance Center so this
186:36 - provides easy access to the data and
186:38 - tools you need to manage to your
186:39 - organization's compliance needs to
186:41 - access the compliance portal you will
186:43 - need to have the following roles Global
186:45 - administrator compliance administrator
186:47 - or compliance data administrator some of
186:50 - the key features of compliance portal
186:51 - include compliance score audits activity
186:55 - alerts solution catalog data
186:57 - classification e-discovery Insider risk
187:00 - management and Records management you
187:02 - can access the compliance portal at
187:05 - compliance.microsoft.com so the default
187:07 - compliance portal home page contains
187:09 - several cards including the compliance
187:11 - manager card so this card leads you to
187:13 - the Microsoft purview compliance manager
187:15 - solution the solution catalog cards
187:17 - include information protection and
187:19 - governance these Solutions help
187:21 - organizations classify protect and
187:23 - retain your data where it lives in
187:25 - wherever it goes examples include data
187:27 - life cycle management and data loss
187:29 - prevention then we have privacy this
187:31 - helps you build a more privacy resilient
187:33 - workplace we have Insider risk
187:35 - management these Solutions help
187:37 - organizations identify analyze and
187:39 - remediate internal risks before they
187:41 - cause harm examples include
187:43 - communication compliance and Insider
187:45 - risk management and we have Discovery
187:47 - and respond so these Solutions help
187:49 - organizations quickly find investigate
187:51 - and respond with relevant data some
187:53 - examples are audit and e-discovery we
187:56 - briefly mentioned the Solutions catalog
187:58 - before but it's great to reinforce that
187:59 - knowledge and we have the active alerts
188:02 - card which includes a summary of the
188:03 - most active alerts in a link where
188:05 - admins can view more detailed
188:06 - information such as alert severity
188:08 - status category and more so that's the
188:12 - Microsoft purview compliance portal
188:14 - [Music]
188:17 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
188:20 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft
188:22 - purview compliance manager which is a
188:24 - feature in the Microsoft purview
188:25 - compliance portal that helps admins to
188:27 - manage an organization's compliance
188:29 - requirements compliance manager helps
188:31 - simplify compliance and reduce Risk by
188:33 - providing for built assessments based on
188:35 - common Regional and Industry regulations
188:37 - and standards including custom
188:39 - assessments to meet compliance needs
188:40 - unique to specific organizations
188:42 - workflow capabilities that enable admins
188:45 - to efficiently complete risk assessments
188:46 - for the organization it provides
188:48 - step-by-step Improvement actions that
188:50 - admins can take to help meet regulations
188:52 - and standards relevant to the
188:53 - organization and it provides a
188:55 - compliance score which is a calculation
188:57 - that helps an organization understand
188:59 - its overall compliance posture by
189:01 - measuring how it's progressing with
189:02 - Improvement actions so here you can see
189:04 - the important sections like Improvement
189:06 - actions Solutions assessments assessment
189:09 - templates and your compliance score
189:11 - which is currently at 69 percent and
189:13 - we'll talk more about the compliance
189:15 - score later so the compliance manager
189:17 - has four key elements that you should
189:18 - have a basic understanding of controls
189:20 - assessments templates and Improvement
189:22 - actions the first is control so a
189:25 - control is a requirement of a regulation
189:27 - standard or policy it defines how to
189:30 - access and manage system configuration
189:31 - organizational process and people
189:34 - responsible for meeting a specific
189:35 - requirement of Regulation standard or
189:38 - policy so compliance manager tracks the
189:41 - following types of controls Microsoft
189:43 - managed controls these are controls for
189:45 - Microsoft cloud services which Microsoft
189:47 - is responsible for implementing there
189:50 - are your controls also known as customer
189:52 - managed controls these are implemented
189:54 - and managed by the organization and
189:56 - share controls so this is the
189:57 - responsibility for implementing these
189:59 - controls as shared by the organization
190:01 - in Microsoft so the next key element are
190:03 - templates and templates help admins to
190:05 - quickly create assessments they can
190:07 - modify these templates to create an
190:09 - assessment optimized for their needs and
190:11 - the next one is Improvement actions this
190:13 - helps centralize compliance activities
190:15 - each Improvement action provides
190:17 - recommended guidance that's intended to
190:18 - help organizations to align with data
190:20 - protection regulations and standards the
190:23 - last key element are assessments so an
190:25 - assessment is a grouping of controls
190:26 - from a specific regulation standard or
190:29 - policy completing the actions within an
190:31 - assessment helps to meet the
190:32 - requirements of a standard regulation or
190:34 - law clicking into an assessment will
190:36 - give you a detailed list of actionable
190:38 - controls as you can see in this image so
190:41 - compliance manager provides many
190:42 - benefits including translating
190:45 - complicated regulations standards
190:47 - company policies or other control
190:49 - Frameworks into a simple language
190:51 - providing access to a large variety of
190:53 - out-of-the-box Assessments and custom
190:55 - assessments to help organizations with
190:56 - their unique compliance needs mapping
190:58 - regulatory controls against recommended
191:01 - Improvement actions providing
191:02 - step-by-step guidance on how to
191:04 - implement the solutions to meet
191:05 - regulatory requirements and helping
191:07 - admins and users to prioritize actions
191:09 - that will have the highest impact on
191:11 - their organizational compliance by
191:13 - associating a score with each action so
191:15 - that's compliance manager
191:17 - [Music]
191:21 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
191:23 - and we're taking a look at compliance
191:25 - score so compliance score measures
191:27 - progress in completing recommended
191:29 - Improvement actions within controls the
191:31 - score helps organization to understand
191:32 - its current compliance posture it also
191:35 - helps organizations to prioritize
191:37 - actions based on their potential to
191:38 - reduce risk admins can get a breakdown
191:40 - of the compliance score in the
191:42 - compliance manager overview pane so
191:44 - here's a visual showing the compliance
191:46 - score breakdown and these are divided
191:48 - into categories such as protect
191:49 - information control access government
191:52 - information and manage devices so the
191:55 - overall compliance score is calculated
191:57 - using scores that are assigned to
191:58 - actions actions come in two types the
192:01 - first is your improved actions which are
192:03 - actions that the organization is
192:04 - expected to manage and the second are
192:06 - Microsoft actions and these are actions
192:08 - that Microsoft manages for the
192:10 - organization so actions are categorized
192:13 - as mandatory discretionary preventative
192:15 - detective or corrective the first is
192:17 - mandatory so these are actions that
192:19 - shouldn't be bypassed and we have
192:21 - discretionary these actions depend on
192:23 - the user's understanding and adhering to
192:25 - a policy we'll talk about the other
192:26 - three actions in the next slide since
192:28 - they're in a subcategory so
192:30 - organizations accumulate points for
192:31 - every action completed and the
192:33 - compliance score is shown as a
192:34 - percentage representing all the actions
192:36 - completed the visual here shows us the
192:38 - list of improvement actions and for each
192:40 - one that's completed you can gain points
192:42 - which would increase your overall
192:44 - compliance score so for this example
192:46 - you're seeing plus 27 points for all the
192:48 - Improvement actions you've completed so
192:51 - back to the type of actions the
192:52 - following are subcategories of actions
192:54 - that can be classified as mandatory or
192:56 - discretionary so preventative actions
192:58 - are designed to handle specific risks
193:00 - like using encryption to protect data at
193:02 - rest if there were breaches or attacks
193:03 - we have detective actions and these
193:06 - actively monitor systems to identify
193:07 - irregularities that could represent
193:09 - risks or that can be used to detect
193:11 - breaches or intrusions and there's
193:13 - corrective actions so these help admins
193:15 - to minimize the adverse effects of
193:16 - security incidents by undertaking
193:18 - corrective measures to reduce their
193:20 - immediate effect were possibly even
193:21 - reverse damage so that's compliance
193:24 - score and its benefits towards an
193:25 - organization
193:26 - [Music]
193:30 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
193:32 - and we're taking a look at the Microsoft
193:34 - purview Insider risk management which is
193:36 - a solution that helps minimize internal
193:38 - risks by enabling an organization to
193:40 - detect investigate and act on risky and
193:43 - malicious activities So within an
193:45 - organization a broad range of internal
193:47 - risks could occur from unethical
193:48 - behavior and actions by employees and
193:50 - managers some of these examples include
193:52 - leaks of sensitive data and data
193:54 - spillage confidentiality violations
193:57 - intellectual property theft fraud
193:59 - insider trading and Regulatory
194:01 - Compliance violations so The Insider
194:04 - risk management is centered around four
194:06 - principles the first one is transparency
194:08 - so balance user privacy versus
194:10 - organization risk with privacy by Design
194:12 - architecture the second one is
194:14 - configurable so configurable policies
194:16 - based on industry geographical and
194:19 - business groups the third one is
194:20 - integrated so there's integrated
194:22 - workflow across Microsoft purview
194:24 - Solutions and actionable so it provides
194:26 - insights to enable user notifications
194:28 - data investigations and user are
194:31 - investigations so Insider risk
194:33 - management in Microsoft purview uses the
194:35 - following workflow to identify and
194:37 - resolve internal risk activities and
194:38 - compliance issues the first is policies
194:41 - so these are created using predefined
194:42 - templates and policy conditions that
194:44 - Define what risk indicators are examined
194:46 - in Microsoft 365 feature areas next we
194:49 - have alerts so alerts are automatically
194:51 - generated by risk indicators that match
194:53 - policy conditions and are displayed in
194:55 - the alerts dashboard this dashboard
194:57 - enables a quick view of all alerts
194:58 - needing review open alerts over time and
195:01 - alert statistics for the organization
195:03 - then we have triage which are new
195:05 - activities that need investigation
195:06 - automatically generate alerts that are
195:08 - assigned and needs review status we have
195:10 - investigate so cases are created for
195:12 - alerts that require deeper review and
195:13 - investigation of the details and
195:15 - circumstances around the policy match
195:17 - and the last one is action so reviewers
195:19 - can immediately act to resolve issues
195:21 - after they've been investigated or they
195:23 - can collaborate with other risk
195:24 - stakeholders in the organization actions
195:27 - can be as simple as sending a
195:28 - notification when employees accidentally
195:30 - violate policy conditions in more
195:32 - serious cases reviewers may need to
195:34 - share The Insider risk management case
195:36 - information with other reviewers in the
195:38 - organization so that's The Insider Risk
195:41 - Management Solutions to protect against
195:42 - internal threats
195:44 - [Music]
195:47 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
195:50 - and we're taking a look at e-discovery
195:52 - which is a service found within
195:53 - Microsoft purview so e-discovery stands
195:56 - for electronic Discovery and this is the
195:58 - process of identifying and delivering
196:00 - electronic information that can be used
196:02 - as evidence in legal cases so you can
196:04 - use the discovery Tools in Microsoft 365
196:07 - to search for content in exchange online
196:09 - mailboxes Microsoft 365 groups Microsoft
196:13 - teams SharePoint online OneDrive for
196:16 - business sites Skype for business
196:17 - conversations and jabber teams so
196:20 - Microsoft purview provides us with three
196:22 - Discovery Solutions the first one is
196:24 - content search which lets you run a
196:26 - search across content the second one is
196:28 - e-discovery standard also known as core
196:31 - Discovery is a workflow to search and
196:33 - Export content and the last one is
196:35 - e-discovery premium also known as
196:37 - advanced ediscovery is an end-to-end
196:39 - workflow to preserve collect review
196:41 - analyze and Export content for internal
196:43 - or external investigation and we'll talk
196:45 - more about these three solutions in the
196:47 - next slide sites so you Discovery
196:49 - standard in Microsoft 365 provides a
196:52 - basic e-discovery tool that
196:53 - organizations can use to search and
196:55 - Export content in Microsoft 365 in
196:57 - office 365. you can use the discovery
197:00 - standard to place an e-discovery hold on
197:02 - content locations such as exchange
197:04 - mailboxes SharePoint sites OneDrive
197:07 - accounts and Microsoft teams nothing is
197:09 - needed to deploy e-discovery standard
197:11 - but there are some prerequisite tasks
197:13 - that an IT admin and e-discovery manager
197:15 - have to complete before your
197:17 - organization can start using e-discovery
197:19 - standard to search export and preserve
197:21 - content so those requirements would be
197:23 - things like the initial setup you'll
197:25 - need to verify and assign appropriate
197:27 - licenses assignee Discovery permissions
197:29 - and create a Core e-discovery case and
197:31 - from there you can use the create and
197:33 - e-discovery hold feature search for
197:35 - content and Export and download search
197:37 - results so let's take a closer look here
197:40 - at content search to perform a Content
197:42 - search you can create a new search
197:43 - specify the locations and provide the
197:46 - keywords and conditions keep in mind
197:48 - that if you leave the keywords blank it
197:50 - will return all items with the
197:51 - conditions so I just want you to notice
197:54 - a few things here in the visuals here
197:55 - you can create a new search and you can
197:57 - search by ID list here we have our
197:59 - location that we can turn on or off so
198:01 - we have exchange Point SharePoint ad
198:04 - exchange you could also search within a
198:06 - hold so you have your keywords here you
198:08 - can leave that blank and they have a
198:09 - long list of conditions that you can
198:11 - choose from here moving on to
198:13 - e-discovery holds so a whole preserves
198:15 - content that might be relevant to a
198:17 - specific e-discovery case you can place
198:19 - a hold in basically the same locations
198:21 - we've mentioned before so exchange
198:22 - mailboxes OneDrive for business
198:24 - Microsoft teams Office 365 groups and
198:28 - Yammer groups the content is preserved
198:30 - until you remove the content location
198:31 - from the holder until you delete the
198:33 - hold and after you create an e-discovery
198:35 - hold it may take up to 24 hours for the
198:38 - hole to take effect taking a look at
198:39 - e-discovery premium formerly Advanced
198:42 - e-discovery so a discovery premium
198:44 - workflow Builds on the existing
198:45 - e-discovery standard workflow it is an
198:48 - end-to-end workflow to preserve collect
198:50 - review analyze and Export content that's
198:52 - relevant to your organization's internal
198:54 - and external investigations it also lets
198:57 - legal teams manage the entire legal hold
198:59 - notification workflow to communicate
199:00 - with custodians involved in a case so
199:03 - the built-in workflow of e-discovery
199:04 - Premium aligns with the electronic
199:06 - Discovery reference model edrm which is
199:09 - a framework that outlines standards for
199:11 - recovery and discovery of Digital Data
199:13 - so the workflow would essentially look
199:14 - something like this add custodians to a
199:17 - case search custodial data sources for
199:19 - data relevant to the case add data to a
199:21 - review set review and analyze data in a
199:23 - review set and Export and download case
199:25 - data so that's the discovery and its
199:28 - types of solutions and capabilities
199:30 - [Music]
199:34 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
199:36 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft
199:38 - purview auditing Solutions so what is an
199:40 - audit it's the investigating of a
199:42 - security events forensic investigations
199:44 - internal investigations and compliance
199:47 - obligations and audit would involve
199:49 - capturing recording and retaining a
199:51 - unified audit log so Microsoft 365 has
199:55 - two auditing Solutions the first one is
199:57 - audit standard formerly known as basic
199:59 - audit and this is enabled by default it
200:02 - provides thousands of searchable audit
200:04 - events it has a 90-day audit record
200:06 - retention you can export audit records
200:08 - to a CSV file you can use the audit
200:10 - Search tool in the Microsoft compliance
200:12 - portal it provides access to audit logs
200:14 - via Office 365 management activity API
200:18 - you can also use it in Powershell with
200:20 - the search Unified audit log commandlet
200:21 - the second auditing solution is audit
200:24 - premium formerly known as advanced audit
200:26 - so this includes all of the audit
200:28 - standard features but it provides audit
200:30 - log retention policies it has longer
200:32 - retention of audit records it has as
200:34 - high value and crucial events and has
200:36 - higher bandwidth to The Office 365
200:38 - management activity API so those are the
200:41 - Microsoft purview auditing Solutions
200:43 - you'll need to know
200:44 - [Music]
200:48 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
200:50 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft
200:52 - priva and privacy risk management so
200:54 - organizations must adopt a privacy by
200:57 - default policy to meet regulatory
200:58 - requirements and build customer trust
201:00 - Microsoft priva helps you achieve your
201:02 - privacy goals by addressing issues like
201:04 - helping employees adopt sound data
201:06 - handling practices and training them to
201:08 - spot and fix issues understanding the
201:10 - potential risks and the amount and type
201:12 - of personal data they store and share
201:14 - and fulfilling data subject requests or
201:16 - subject rights requests efficiently and
201:18 - on time previous capabilities are
201:20 - available through two solutions first we
201:22 - have priva privacy risk management which
201:25 - provides visibility into your
201:26 - organization's data and policy templates
201:28 - for reducing risks we'll talk more about
201:30 - this in the next slide and there's
201:32 - previous subject rights requests which
201:34 - provides Automation and workflow tools
201:36 - for fulfilling data requests so
201:38 - Microsoft priva helps you understand the
201:40 - data your organization stores by
201:41 - automating discovery of personal data
201:43 - assets and providing visualizations of
201:45 - essential information the overview
201:47 - dashboard provides an overall view into
201:49 - your organization's data in Microsoft
201:51 - 365 privacy administrators can monitor
201:54 - Trends and activities identify and
201:56 - investigate potential risks involving
201:58 - personal data and springboard into Key
202:00 - activities like policy management or
202:02 - subject rights request actions the data
202:05 - profile page in preva provides a
202:06 - snapshot view of the personal data your
202:08 - organization stores in Microsoft 365 and
202:11 - where it lives it also gives insight
202:13 - into the types of data you store priv
202:15 - evaluates your organization's data
202:17 - stored in the following Microsoft 365
202:19 - Services exchange online SharePoint
202:22 - online OneDrive for business and
202:24 - Microsoft teams privacy risk management
202:26 - policies are meant to be internal guides
202:28 - and can help you detect over exposed
202:30 - personal data so that users can secure
202:32 - it spot and limit transfers of personal
202:34 - data across departments or Regional
202:36 - borders and help users identify and
202:39 - reduce the amount of unused personal
202:40 - data that you store so that's Microsoft
202:43 - private and the Privacy risk management
202:44 - Concepts
202:46 - [Music]
202:49 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
202:52 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft's
202:54 - privacy principles so Microsoft's
202:56 - approach to privacy is built on the
202:58 - following six principles the first one
203:00 - is control so Microsoft States we will
203:02 - put you in control of your privacy with
203:04 - easy to use tools and Clear Choices the
203:06 - second is transparency so we will be
203:08 - transparent about data collection and
203:10 - use so you can make informed decisions
203:12 - the third is security we will protect
203:14 - the data you entrust to us through
203:15 - strong security and encryption the next
203:17 - one is strong legal protections we will
203:19 - respect your local privacy laws and
203:21 - fight for legal protection of your
203:23 - privacy as a fundamental human right the
203:25 - fifth principle is no content-based
203:27 - targeting we will not use your email
203:28 - chat files or other personal content to
203:31 - Target ads to you and the last principle
203:33 - is benefits to you Microsoft States when
203:35 - we do collect data we will use it to
203:37 - benefit you and to make your experiences
203:39 - better so those are Microsoft six
203:41 - privacy principles briefly summarized
203:43 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
203:46 - and we're going to take a look at an
203:47 - overview of Microsoft purview we'll be
203:49 - going through the main components of the
203:51 - Microsoft purview that you'll see on the
203:53 - exam you can reach the Microsoft purview
203:55 - compliance portal at
203:56 - compliance.microsoft.com or
203:58 - alternatively you can find it at the all
204:00 - admin Center Page in the Microsoft 365
204:03 - admin Center under the name compliance
204:04 - so in general the Microsoft purview
204:07 - compliance portal is for managing
204:09 - compliance needs using Integrated
204:10 - Solutions to help protect sensitive info
204:12 - manage data life cycles reduce Insider
204:15 - risks Safeguard personal data and more
204:18 - one of the key components of the
204:20 - Microsoft purview is the compliance
204:21 - manager the compliance manager has a
204:23 - feature called compliance score which
204:25 - measures your progress in completing
204:26 - recommended actions that help reduce
204:28 - risks around data protection and
204:30 - Regulatory standards Microsoft purview
204:33 - calculates your compliance score based
204:34 - on your organization beside the
204:37 - compliance score the system tells you
204:39 - the key Improvement actions you can
204:40 - complete to improve the compliance score
204:42 - let's click into it so here we see a
204:45 - list of improvement actions that grant
204:46 - us points that improve our compliance
204:48 - score you can filter out regulations
204:50 - Solutions groups categories and more to
204:53 - find the Improvement action you're
204:54 - interested in for example we can click
204:56 - on enable self-service password reset so
204:59 - here Microsoft recommends that your
205:01 - organization enables self-service
205:02 - password reset to allow users who have
205:04 - either forgotten their password or whose
205:06 - account has been locked out as a result
205:07 - of malicious attempts so we'll click on
205:10 - assign action we'll select a user and
205:12 - assign the action to that user
205:14 - next you'll need to click on launch now
205:18 - now we're at the Azure active directory
205:20 - admin Center password reset page so
205:22 - we'll click on all to enable
205:23 - self-service password reset and save the
205:26 - changes to take effect the process of
205:28 - calculating and updating the points in
205:29 - compliance score may take up to 24 hours
205:33 - so in the data classification section
205:35 - the key things here would be sensitivity
205:37 - labels these let you classify and
205:39 - protect your organization's data while
205:41 - making sure that user productivity and
205:43 - their ability to collaborate isn't
205:45 - hindered the next thing we'll look at
205:46 - are reports and here you can view status
205:48 - and trends for the compliance of your
205:50 - Microsoft 365 devices data identities
205:53 - apps and infrastructure the next thing
205:56 - we'll look at is the solution catalog so
205:58 - here you can discover learn about and
206:00 - start using the intelligent compliance
206:02 - and Risk Management Solutions available
206:04 - to your organization the solution
206:06 - catalog is categorized into cards and
206:08 - further divided into subcategories based
206:10 - on your needs for example we have
206:12 - information protection and governance
206:14 - then there are four other subcategories
206:16 - such as data lifecycle management data
206:18 - loss prevention information protection
206:20 - and Records management there are a few
206:23 - more listed below like privacy Insider
206:25 - risk management and Discovery and
206:27 - response another important component of
206:29 - Microsoft purview is audit an audit can
206:31 - be used when you need to find out if a
206:33 - user deleted a document or if an admin
206:34 - resets someone's password you can search
206:36 - The Office 365 audit log to find out
206:39 - what the users and admins in your
206:41 - organization have been doing you'll be
206:42 - able to find activity related to email
206:44 - groups documents permissions directory
206:47 - services and much more
206:50 - next we have Microsoft purview
206:52 - e-discovery in Microsoft purview
206:54 - provides a basic e-discovery tool that
206:56 - organizations can use to search and
206:57 - Export content in Microsoft 365 in
207:00 - office 365. you can also use the
207:03 - discovery to place an e-discovery hold
207:04 - on content locations such as exchange
207:07 - mailboxes SharePoint sites OneDrive
207:09 - accounts and Microsoft teams there are
207:12 - three types of e-discovery standard
207:13 - premium and user data search next we
207:16 - have information protection you can
207:18 - Implement capabilities for Microsoft
207:20 - purview information protection to help
207:21 - you discover classify and protect
207:24 - sensitive information wherever it lives
207:26 - or travels then we have Insider risk
207:28 - management so this helps address risks
207:30 - in the modern workplace you can detect
207:32 - risky activity like sensitive data leaks
207:34 - and theft security policy violations and
207:37 - health record access get insights into
207:39 - potential Insider risks an Insider risk
207:42 - analytics helps quickly identify
207:43 - potential risks in your org and
207:45 - recommends policies to address them
207:47 - collaborate on investigations seamless
207:49 - workflows allowed to teams across your
207:51 - org to work together on reviewing and
207:53 - taking action on potential risks built
207:55 - with privacy in mind protect users
207:57 - privacy by pseudonymizing their names
207:58 - across all Insider risk features so
208:01 - those are some of the key important
208:03 - components of Microsoft purview
208:05 - [Music]
208:13 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
208:15 - and we're taking a look at the pricing
208:17 - models for Microsoft cloud services
208:18 - starting with Cloud solution provider
208:21 - abbreviated as CSP so the CSP program
208:24 - helps you be more involved in your
208:26 - customers businesses Beyond reselling
208:28 - licenses and may include the following
208:30 - benefits deeper customer engagements so
208:32 - you can meet with customers on a regular
208:34 - basis to gain a better understanding of
208:36 - their business and demands you can get
208:38 - increased profits so increasing your
208:40 - support in Billing Services whether
208:42 - directly or through a third party source
208:43 - and opens up new revenue streams the CSP
208:46 - program adds value you'll be able to
208:48 - offer customers industry-specific
208:50 - Solutions bundled with Microsoft
208:51 - products and it provides managed
208:53 - services so you'll be well positioned to
208:55 - meet customer demand for managed
208:57 - Services the CSP program provides a
208:59 - pay-as-you-go subscription model with
209:01 - per user per month pricing that enables
209:03 - your business to scale up or down from
209:05 - month to month as your needs change so
209:07 - there are two models in the CSP program
209:09 - there's the indirect model and the
209:11 - direct Bill model for the indirect model
209:13 - you may consider this model if you want
209:15 - to provide more services to your
209:17 - customers but need some infrastructure
209:18 - support for services like billing the
209:20 - indirect model is a two-tier selling
209:22 - approach through indirect providers and
209:24 - indirect resellers and direct providers
209:26 - offer billing customer service and
209:28 - technical support during the sales cycle
209:30 - and post deal closing they handle a lot
209:32 - of the backend processes enabling the
209:34 - indirect reseller to focus on finding
209:36 - and closing deals indirect providers
209:38 - typically are large well-vetted
209:40 - companies and the indirect model your
209:42 - organization would likely be an indirect
209:44 - reseller so indirect resellers are
209:46 - responsible for finding customers and
209:48 - selling and due to the support from
209:50 - indirect providers you can focus on
209:52 - selling and growing your customer base
209:53 - looking at the direct model so you may
209:56 - consider the CSP direct model if your
209:58 - business already has or is intending to
210:00 - develop appropriate sales billing and
210:02 - support infrastructure in the direct
210:04 - model partners by Microsoft products and
210:07 - subscriptions directly from Microsoft
210:08 - and sell them to their clients through
210:10 - their own sales staff you should meet
210:12 - the following requisites you'll require
210:14 - an active Microsoft partner network ID
210:16 - for the location you're enrolling in you
210:18 - should have an existing customer support
210:19 - infrastructure you'll require an
210:21 - existing customer billing infrastructure
210:23 - and you'll need funds to invest in
210:25 - technical integration and support
210:26 - Readiness so that's the Cloud solution
210:29 - provider program and the two models
210:31 - offered indirect model and direct build
210:33 - model
210:33 - [Music]
210:37 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
210:40 - and we're taking a look at another
210:41 - pricing model for Microsoft cloud
210:43 - services called Enterprise agreement so
210:45 - the Microsoft Enterprise agreement is
210:47 - designed for businesses looking to
210:49 - license software and cloud services for
210:51 - at least three years it provides
210:53 - built-in savings ranging from 15 to 45
210:55 - percent and the Enterprise agreement
210:58 - offers the best value to organizations
210:59 - with 500 or more users or devices so
211:02 - it's really cost effective for more
211:04 - larger sized organizations some of the
211:06 - benefits of Enterprise agreement include
211:08 - it's manageable so it gives you the
211:10 - flexibility to buy cloud services and
211:12 - software licenses under a single
211:14 - organization-wide agreement you can
211:16 - choose from Microsoft cloud services on
211:18 - premises software or a mix of both and
211:20 - migrate on your own terms the software
211:22 - Assurance provides your company with
211:24 - 24x7 technical support planning services
211:27 - and user and Technical Training and
211:29 - Innovative Technologies and you can
211:31 - manage licensing throughout the life of
211:33 - your agreement with the help of a
211:34 - Microsoft certified partner or a
211:36 - Microsoft representative so that's the
211:38 - Microsoft Enterprise agreement
211:40 - [Music]
211:45 - Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're
211:47 - taking a look at the billing and billing
211:49 - management options in Microsoft 365. so
211:52 - a billing account is created when you
211:53 - sign up to try or buy Microsoft products
211:55 - at Cloud settings invoices payment
211:58 - methods and purchases are all managed
212:00 - through your billing account so these
212:01 - are the current types of billing
212:03 - accounts available in the Microsoft 365
212:05 - admin Center the first one is the
212:07 - Microsoft online services program so
212:10 - this billing account is created when you
212:11 - sign up for a Microsoft 365 subscription
212:14 - directly the second one is the Microsoft
212:16 - products and services agreement program
212:18 - and this Billy account is created when
212:20 - your organization signs an mpsa volume
212:22 - licensing agreement to purchase software
212:24 - and online services and the third one is
212:27 - the Microsoft customer agreement so this
212:29 - billing account is created when your
212:31 - organization works with a Microsoft
212:32 - representative and authorized partner or
212:35 - purchases independently moving on to the
212:37 - Bill management section so Microsoft 365
212:41 - billing is managed from the Microsoft
212:42 - 365 admin Center you can manage the
212:45 - subscriptions view billing statements
212:47 - update payment methods change your
212:49 - billing frequency and more in the admin
212:51 - Center the following describes what can
212:53 - be reviewed and modified in the
212:55 - Microsoft 365 admin Center so you can
212:57 - upgrade renew reactivate or cancel
212:59 - subscriptions view the number of
213:01 - purchase licenses and how many of those
213:03 - licenses are assigned to individual
213:05 - users for each service view a bill
213:07 - invoice and pass billing statements you
213:10 - can modify payment methods like updating
213:12 - deleting replacing and adding other
213:14 - types of payment modify your billing
213:16 - frequency to monthly or annual billing
213:18 - you can buy and manage other services or
213:20 - features So based on your Microsoft 365
213:23 - subscription you can add on things like
213:25 - Microsoft Defender for Office 365
213:27 - Microsoft teams calling plan and more
213:30 - you can also manage your billing
213:32 - notification emails and invoice
213:33 - attachments like the list of email
213:35 - accounts of who should receive automated
213:36 - billing notifications so that's the
213:39 - billing and Bill management options for
213:41 - Microsoft 365.
213:42 - [Music]
213:46 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
213:49 - and we're taking a look at billing
213:50 - profiles in Microsoft 365. so a billing
213:54 - profile contains a payment method
213:55 - built-in information and other invoice
213:57 - settings such as purchase order number
213:59 - and email invoice preference you use a
214:01 - billing profile to pay for the products
214:03 - that you buy from Microsoft a billing
214:05 - profile is automatically created when a
214:07 - user makes a self-service purchase and
214:09 - each billing profile is invoiced
214:11 - separately so here's a table listing all
214:13 - of the billing profile roles and
214:15 - describing what they do roles on billing
214:17 - profiles have permissions to control
214:18 - purchases and you can view and manage
214:20 - invoices so you would assign these roles
214:22 - to users who track organize and pay
214:25 - invoices for example you can assign
214:27 - certain members of your Finance team the
214:29 - role of a billing profile contributor
214:31 - the first role we have is billing
214:32 - profile owner so you can manage
214:34 - everything for a billing profile the
214:36 - second role is billing profile
214:37 - contributor so you can manage everything
214:39 - except permissions in a billing profile
214:41 - the third role is billing profile reader
214:44 - with this role you can read only view of
214:46 - everything in a bill billing profile and
214:48 - the last role is invoice manager this
214:50 - role lets you view and pay bills and has
214:52 - a read-only view of everything in a
214:53 - billing profile so those are the billing
214:55 - profiles in Microsoft 365.
214:58 - [Music]
215:01 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
215:04 - and we're taking a look at the Microsoft
215:06 - 365 subscription plans Microsoft 365 has
215:10 - a lot of different subscription plans to
215:12 - Target the right people or organization
215:13 - of any size and within the subscription
215:16 - plans there may be different tier levels
215:18 - so it can be a lot to take in but we'll
215:20 - provide a brief overview of them so the
215:22 - following list describes the
215:23 - subscription Plans offered we have
215:25 - Microsoft 365 for home and this consists

216:38 - subscription tiers E1 E3 and E5 so those
216:42 - are the Microsoft 365 subscription plans
216:45 - currently available and we'll go over
216:47 - some of the important ones in Greater
216:48 - detail in the next sections
216:50 - [Music]
216:54 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
216:56 - and we're taking a closer look at
216:58 - Microsoft 365 for business which is
217:01 - designed for small and medium-sized
217:02 - organizations it offers the full set of
217:04 - Office 365 productivity tools and
217:07 - includes security and device management
217:09 - features however it doesn't include some
217:11 - of the more advanced information
217:12 - protection compliance or analytics tools
217:15 - available to Enterprise subscribers it's
217:17 - typically designed for organizations
217:19 - that need up to 300 licenses and as we
217:22 - mentioned before there's four available
217:23 - plans for Microsoft 365 for business so
217:27 - we have apps for business business basic
217:29 - business standard and business premium
217:31 - so looking at a general overview of what
217:34 - each plan has to offer starting off with

218:46 - that's all the Microsoft 365 for
218:49 - business subscriptions available and the
218:50 - features each of them include
218:52 - [Music]
218:56 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
218:58 - and we're taking a closer look at
219:00 - Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscription
219:02 - plans and these plans provide Enterprise
219:04 - class services to organizations that
219:07 - want a productivity solution that
219:08 - includes robust threat Protection
219:09 - security compliance and analytics
219:12 - features like we briefly mentioned
219:14 - before there are three available plans
219:16 - for Microsoft 365 Enterprise there's E3
219:19 - E5 and F3 which is formerly F1 so the E5
219:23 - plan is the most expensive plan and it
219:25 - includes all the same features as E3 but
219:28 - it also includes the latest Advanced
219:30 - threat Protection security and
219:31 - collaboration tools and the F3 is
219:34 - designed for first-line workers through
219:35 - purpose-built tools and resources that
219:37 - allow them to do their best work and
219:39 - here you can see the prices of each
219:40 - subscription plan in a brief summary of
219:42 - what they offer so here's a table
219:44 - listing all of the features included in
219:46 - each plan you can see that all the plans
219:48 - fully include M365 apps like PowerPoint
219:51 - Word and Excel email and calendar

220:09 - F3 only partially includes things like
220:10 - meets and voice identity and access
220:12 - management information protection and
220:15 - compliance management so that's the
220:17 - Microsoft 365 Enterprise plans
220:20 - [Music]
220:24 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
220:26 - and we're taking a look at Microsoft 365
220:29 - licenses so what is a license well a
220:32 - license allows your users to use the
220:34 - features and services included in the
220:35 - subscription plan Microsoft 365 products
220:38 - and services are available as user
220:40 - subscription licenses abbreviated as
220:43 - usls and are licensed on a per user
220:45 - basis so the following list describes
220:47 - the options that are available the first
220:49 - option are full usls and these are for
220:51 - new customers who haven't previously
220:53 - purchased Microsoft products and
220:55 - services the second option or ad on usls
220:58 - and these are for on-premises software
220:59 - customers who want to add Microsoft 365
221:02 - Cloud products and services the third
221:04 - option are from saus and these are for
221:07 - on-premises software Assurance customers
221:09 - that want to transition to the cloud the
221:11 - last option we have are step up usls and
221:13 - these are for customers who want to
221:14 - upgrade the level of their service and
221:16 - so each user accessing Microsoft 365
221:19 - products and services is required to be
221:21 - assigned to USL administrators manage
221:23 - licenses in in the Microsoft 365 admin
221:26 - Center they can assign the licenses to
221:28 - individual user or guest accounts now
221:30 - taking a look at the Microsoft 365
221:32 - add-on licensing options so Microsoft
221:35 - 365 business plans have add-ons that you
221:37 - can purchase for your subscriptions and
221:40 - these add-ons provide more capabilities
221:41 - to enhance your subscription there are
221:43 - currently two types of add-ons available
221:45 - the first type of add-ons are
221:47 - traditional add-ons and these are linked
221:49 - to a specific subscription and if you
221:51 - cancel the subscription the linked
221:52 - add-on is also canceled the second typer
221:55 - Standalone add-ons and these appear as a
221:57 - separate subscription on the your
221:58 - products page within the Microsoft 365
222:01 - admin Center they have their own
222:02 - expiration date and are managed the same
222:04 - way you would any other subscription so
222:06 - those are the Microsoft 365 licenses and
222:09 - add-on options
222:10 - [Music]
222:14 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
222:16 - and we're taking a look at the Microsoft
222:18 - 365 service life cycle so typically a
222:22 - product or service life cycle has three
222:24 - phases the first phase is private
222:26 - preview then the second phase is public
222:28 - preview and the third phase is General
222:30 - availability abbreviated as GA and when
222:33 - a product or a service retires it
222:34 - reaches the phase end of support so
222:36 - let's take a closer look at these three
222:38 - phases including the end of support
222:40 - looking at private preview so in this
222:42 - phase Microsoft May release a product or
222:44 - service to a limited number of users to
222:46 - test and evaluate new features or
222:48 - functionality this does not come with
222:50 - formal support and users are allowed to
222:52 - sign up to be members but the preview
222:54 - releases it made available to the public
222:56 - next we have public preview and in this
222:58 - phase Microsoft typically releases
223:00 - public previews of products and services
223:02 - before their General availability
223:04 - release to receive feedback from a broad
223:06 - range of users this phase allows users
223:08 - to explore and test upcoming
223:09 - functionality and users may also receive
223:12 - some limited support depending on the
223:13 - product or service service moving on to
223:15 - General availability so after the public
223:17 - preview is completed Microsoft releases
223:20 - the product or service the product or
223:22 - service now becomes available to all
223:24 - customers with formal support known as
223:26 - the release version the products and
223:27 - services in this phase have been through
223:29 - a full development and test life cycle
223:31 - to ensure stability and reliability and
223:33 - with Microsoft 365 new features are
223:36 - added to the products and services
223:37 - periodically taking a look at end of
223:39 - support So eventually older products or
223:42 - retired Services can no longer be
223:44 - supported and these products and
223:45 - services will reach the end of support
223:47 - once a product or service reaches end of
223:49 - support it will no longer receive
223:51 - updates or assisted support customers
223:53 - are encouraged to migrate to the latest
223:55 - version of the product or service so
223:57 - that's the Microsoft 365 service life
224:00 - cycle
224:00 - [Music]
224:04 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
224:06 - and we're taking a look at the Modern
224:08 - Life Cycle policy for Microsoft 365. so
224:11 - Microsoft 365 is covered by the Modern
224:14 - Life Cycle policy and this covers
224:16 - products and services that are serviced
224:18 - and supported continuously if the
224:20 - following conditions are met products
224:22 - and services governed by the Modern Life
224:24 - Cycle policy will be supported the first
224:26 - condition states that customers are to
224:28 - stay current as per the servicing and
224:29 - system requirements published for the
224:31 - product or service stay current means
224:33 - that customers accept and apply all
224:35 - servicing updates for their products and
224:37 - services the second condition states
224:39 - that customers must be licensed to use
224:41 - the product or service and the last
224:43 - condition states that Microsoft must
224:44 - currently offer support for the product
224:46 - or service also under the Modern Life
224:49 - Cycle policy Microsoft gives a minimum
224:51 - of 12 months notice before ending
224:52 - support for products so that's a quick
224:55 - overview of the Modern Life Cycle policy
224:58 - foreign
225:01 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
225:03 - and we're taking a look at the Microsoft
225:05 - 365 roadmap portal which is typically
225:08 - used for organizations to plan for the
225:10 - future Microsoft regularly includes
225:12 - updates for its products and services in
225:14 - the Microsoft 365 roadmap the roadmap is

228:43 - you can narrow it down using filters
228:44 - according to your preferences so that's
228:46 - a quick overview of the Microsoft 365
228:49 - roadmap portal
228:50 - [Music]
228:54 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
228:56 - and we're taking a look at the Support
228:58 - options for Microsoft 365 services so
229:01 - administrators and users in your
229:03 - organization may have difficulty
229:04 - resolving issues on their own it's
229:06 - reassuring to know that they can get
229:08 - help with Microsoft 365 Services anytime
229:10 - they need it through a variety of
229:12 - Support options the support option
229:14 - chosen to deal with a particular issue
229:15 - depends on the tool or service where the
229:18 - issue has arisen the type of
229:19 - subscription your organization uses and
229:21 - the kind of support your organization
229:23 - needs so here's a list of ways your
229:25 - organization can get access to support
229:27 - the first is through community-based
229:29 - support this is where the Microsoft 365
229:32 - Tech Community provides community-based
229:33 - support for your organization allowing
229:35 - you to collaborate with others and solve
229:37 - challenges then we have proactive
229:39 - support so your organization can install
229:41 - the Microsoft support and recovery
229:43 - assistant to help identify Problems by
229:45 - running tests and offer the best
229:46 - solution for those problems then we have
229:49 - web chat email and phone support So your
229:51 - organization can submit issues to
229:53 - Microsoft support for technical billing
229:55 - and subscription support via email
229:57 - online web chat or phone we have
230:00 - pre-sale support your organization is
230:02 - provided with assistance on subscription
230:04 - features benefits and your purchasing
230:06 - decision for Microsoft 365 Services then
230:09 - there's Fast Track This is where your
230:11 - organization can connect with expert
230:13 - Microsoft Engineers project managers and
230:16 - resources to help deploy Microsoft 365
230:18 - services and resolve issues then we have
230:20 - Premier support for Microsoft 365. so
230:23 - your Enterprise organization can receive
230:25 - on-site support a dedicated technical
230:27 - account manager and access to advisory
230:30 - Services the last support option is you
230:32 - can get support through a Microsoft
230:33 - partner this is where your organization
230:35 - can get support directly through a
230:37 - certified Microsoft 365 partner so
230:40 - that's the Support options for Microsoft
230:42 - 365 services
230:44 - [Music]
230:48 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
230:50 - and we're taking a look at how to create
230:52 - a support request so if you need help
230:54 - with using Microsoft 365 you can create
230:57 - a support request through the Microsoft
230:58 - 365 admin Center here is a visual
231:01 - showing the Microsoft 365 admin Center
231:04 - and here you would navigate to the
231:05 - support section and click on new service
231:07 - requests to create one the second visual
231:09 - here simply shows the service request
231:11 - history so you would click on view
231:13 - service requests and you can see the
231:15 - history of what service requests you
231:16 - submitted before and you can check on
231:18 - the status of the service requests for
231:20 - any replies so the following steps
231:22 - describe how to create a support request
231:24 - as an administrator the first step is to
231:26 - sign into the Microsoft 365 admin center
231:29 - with your Microsoft 365 admin account in
231:32 - the left navigation menu select show all
231:34 - to expand the rest of the options select
231:36 - support to expand the Support options
231:38 - select new service request so you've
231:41 - seen these steps so far from the visuals
231:43 - on the previous slide now on the right a
231:45 - support window will open where you can
231:46 - enter your support question and view the
231:48 - results that's the visual on the right
231:50 - here showing it and if the recommended
231:52 - instructions or articles don't answer
231:53 - your questions select on the headset
231:55 - iCloud at the top or select contact
231:57 - support at the bottom to contact
231:59 - technical support still in the required
232:01 - information like title description
232:03 - preferred contact method Etc and select
232:06 - contact me and a support agent will
232:08 - contact you so those are the
232:10 - instructions on how to create a support
232:11 - request
232:12 - [Music]
232:16 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
232:18 - and we're taking a look at the service
232:20 - level agreement Concepts abbreviated as
232:22 - SLA in Microsoft 365. so Microsoft 365
232:27 - Services guarantees level of service for
232:29 - your organization in a detailed legal
232:30 - agreement referred to as a service level
232:32 - agreement Microsoft details its
232:34 - commitment to provide and maintain
232:36 - agreed service levels for M365 Services
232:38 - through its Microsoft online services
232:40 - agreement your organization can also
232:43 - take advantage of the service level
232:44 - agreement with your cloud service
232:45 - provider note that the guarantees of
232:47 - service provided for Microsoft 365
232:50 - services will vary between cloud service
232:51 - providers so Microsoft's online service
232:54 - level agreement introduces several
232:56 - Concepts the first one is incident and
232:58 - this is a set of events or single event
233:00 - that results in downtime the second one
233:02 - is uptime this is the total time your
233:04 - services are functional the next one is
233:07 - downtime and the definition of downtime
233:09 - depends on the relevant service for
233:11 - example with Microsoft teams any period
233:13 - of time where users are unable to
233:14 - initiate online meetings see present
233:17 - statuses or unable to instant messages
233:19 - considered downtime your downtime
233:21 - reduces the total time your services are
233:23 - functional then we have claim so a claim
233:25 - raises information about an incident and
233:27 - your organization is responsible for
233:29 - submitting a claim on an incident the
233:31 - next concept is an important one called
233:33 - service credit and so service credits
233:35 - are submitted by the organization's
233:37 - admin if the claim is successfully
233:39 - approved by Microsoft your organization
233:41 - will receive service credits the service
233:43 - credit will be the percentage of the
233:45 - total monthly fees your organization
233:46 - paid for the month where you experience
233:48 - downtime then we have service level and
233:50 - this is the performance metric set forth
233:52 - in the SLA that Microsoft agrees to meet
233:54 - in the delivery of the services and the
233:56 - last concept is uptime agreement and the
233:58 - uptime agreement is defined by the
234:00 - monthly uptime percentage which we'll
234:02 - explain a bit more in the next slide so
234:04 - downtime is any period of time when
234:06 - office applications are put into reduced
234:08 - functionality mode due to an issue with
234:09 - Office 365 activation and the monthly
234:12 - uptime percentage is typically
234:13 - calculated using the following formula
234:16 - but this may not apply to every service
234:18 - so user minutes minus downtime divided
234:20 - by user minutes times 100 where downtime
234:23 - is measured in user minutes that is for
234:25 - each month downtime is the sum of the
234:27 - length of each incident that occurs
234:28 - during that month multiplied by the
234:29 - number of users impacted by that
234:31 - incident the percentage of service
234:33 - credit your organization can receive is
234:35 - linked to your monthly uptime percentage
234:37 - for example if downtime has resulted in
234:39 - a monthly uptime percentage lower than
234:41 - 95 percent your organization could
234:43 - receive a 100 percent service credit and
234:46 - the table here describes the monthly
234:48 - uptime percentage and corresponding
234:49 - service credit so if the monthly uptime
234:52 - percentage is less than 99.9 percent you
234:55 - could get 25 service credit if the
234:57 - monthly uptime percentage is less than
234:59 - 99 you could get 50 service credit and
235:03 - if it's less than 95 percent you could
235:05 - get 100 service credit so your
235:07 - organization should always review all
235:09 - service level agreements and ask
235:10 - questions including the following list
235:12 - if you're using a cloud service provider
235:14 - how does it determine service levels and
235:16 - whether they're achieved or not who is
235:18 - responsible for reports how can your
235:20 - organization access reports are there
235:22 - any exceptions in the agreement what
235:24 - does the agreement say about both
235:25 - unexpected and scheduled maintenance
235:27 - what does the agreement say about what
235:29 - happens if your infrastructure goes down
235:31 - because of an attack what about natural
235:33 - disasters and other situations outside
235:35 - of your control does the agreement cover
235:37 - not Microsoft service or system failures
235:39 - what are the limits to the cloud service
235:41 - provider's liability in the agreement so
235:43 - that's the overview of SLA
235:45 - [Music]
235:49 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
235:51 - and we're taking a look at the health
235:53 - status of Microsoft 365 services so the
235:56 - Microsoft 365 admin Center allows your
235:59 - organization's administrators to see the
236:01 - current health status of each of your
236:02 - Microsoft 365 services and tenants they
236:06 - can view the history of services that
236:07 - have been affected in the last 30 days
236:09 - and information about current outages or
236:11 - disruptions to Services viewing the
236:13 - health can help you figure out whether
236:14 - you're dealing with a known issue that
236:16 - has a solution in progress you can go to
236:18 - Select Health under the left navigation
236:20 - pane then service Health to access it so
236:22 - if your organization is experiencing a
236:24 - service issue your administrators can
236:26 - report it by going to reported issues
236:28 - select report and issue and complete a
236:30 - short form administrators can view
236:32 - specific details about service issues
236:34 - selecting incidents or advisories your
236:36 - organization can set up notifications
236:38 - for any new incidents or for updates to
236:40 - any active incidents that might affect
236:42 - your organization Microsoft provides two
236:45 - different types of notifications the
236:47 - first one is unplanned downtime this is
236:49 - where in incident has caused a service
236:50 - to become unresponsive or unavailable
236:52 - and the second one is plan maintenance
236:54 - where Microsoft regularly carries out
236:56 - service updates to the software and
236:58 - infrastructure that runs Services
236:59 - Microsoft also analyzes unplanned
237:02 - service incidents for you through
237:03 - post-incident reviews you'll receive a
237:05 - preliminary review within the first two
237:07 - days of incident resolution and a final
237:09 - review within five business days the
237:11 - final post incident reviews will detail
237:13 - the following information how you might
237:15 - have been impacted and how the user
237:17 - experience was impacted a date and time
237:19 - breakdown detailing when an incident
237:21 - started and when it was resolved and an
237:23 - analysis of the root cause and what
237:24 - actions are to be carried out to prevent
237:26 - the incident in the future so your
237:28 - organization can keep track of the
237:30 - health status of services in different
237:31 - ways first we have admin app this lets
237:34 - you view and stay up to date with the
237:35 - health status of the services on the go
237:37 - then we have Microsoft System enter
237:39 - which allows you to view all service
237:40 - Communications from within system center
237:42 - if your organization has the Office 365
237:45 - management pack and API you can use the
237:48 - Office 365 service Communications API to
237:51 - create or use tools that can connect and
237:52 - monitor the service status for you in
237:54 - real time to protect and keep your
237:56 - organization's data available Microsoft
237:58 - does the following data storage
238:00 - redundancy so Microsoft stores your data
238:02 - through multiple levels of redundancy
238:04 - using data replication and secure data
238:06 - protection capabilities monitoring data
238:09 - so your databases are monitored for you
238:10 - and your data is monitored packet loss
238:13 - latencies and queries and more
238:15 - preventative measures so Microsoft
238:17 - regularly carries out checks for
238:18 - database consistency reviews of error
238:21 - logs and more so that's an overview of
238:23 - the health status of Microsoft 365
238:25 - services
238:27 - [Music]
238:30 - hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro
238:33 - and we're taking a look at how
