00:00 - In this video we are going to talk about
an important device in networking called
00:04 - a 'network interface card' or NIC. So
before we talk about that I want to give
00:10 - you an example of how humans communicate. Now imagine we have three different people:
00:15 - John, Bob, and Mary. How did they talk? When you're talking you're using your mouth.
00:20 - So you're transmitting information using
the mouth and the other person is
00:25 - receiving the information through their
ears. Now, how do computers, y'know, talk or
00:31 - listen? They have a device called 'network
interface card' which acts as the ear
00:37 - and the mouth of the computer. So that's
how computers talk through the 'network
00:44 - interface card.'
