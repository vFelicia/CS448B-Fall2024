00:05 - hey everybody its Jesse and I hope
00:10 - everybody had a nice weekend I had a
00:13 - long weekend it was a holiday here in
00:15 - the US yesterday so that's why I didn't
00:17 - stream yesterday and I tried I tried
00:21 - really hard to take a break from coding
00:24 - since I've been a little bit burnout at
00:29 - the end of last week so I think I went
00:32 - to full day's without coding anything I
00:35 - did do some work on Saturday but Sunday
00:38 - and Monday I did nothing so it's been a
00:42 - really long time since I learned two
00:44 - full days without coding anything so
00:47 - that was that was kind of nice relaxing
00:51 - so today we're going to try to get
00:56 - Google Analytics working with this so
00:58 - there's we have Google Analytics already
01:00 - on there if you've been watching you
01:03 - might remember when we added that in but
01:06 - it's not working
01:08 - exactly the way we wanted to I knew this
01:11 - was going to happen I just didn't have
01:13 - time to deal with it before the launch
01:15 - and as I suspected we haven't really had
01:18 - very much traffic so it's not a big deal
01:21 - that the analytics aren't like a hundred
01:23 - percent what we want them to be but I'd
01:26 - like to get them up and running the
01:29 - right way as soon as I can
01:32 - so we can start getting the best data so
01:34 - let me show you what the problem is well
01:36 - Alex I'll tell you what it is and then
01:39 - I'll show it to you in case you're not
01:41 - sure what I'm talking about
01:43 - we're using client-side routing so when
01:50 - the page first loads Google Analytics
01:53 - loads like normal
01:54 - okay the tracks a page you but then
01:56 - after that when we click to another page
01:59 - in the site the analytics code doesn't
02:03 - do anything it doesn't register that a
02:07 - new that it changes has happened so no
02:11 - data gets that so I'll show you
02:13 - what's going on and let me pull this off
02:17 - for a second and I'll bring in the site
02:21 - okay so I'm going to I've got the the
02:27 - real-time analytics up right now
02:30 - and all this is showing is just who's on
02:34 - the site right now and what page they're
02:36 - on ok so right now I'm on the team page
02:40 - I'm going to hit refresh let's see if
02:43 - this will do it for us let's see if we
02:48 - refresh will trigger if I'm gonna have
02:52 - to completely open up a new there we go
02:55 - okay so refresh triggered this then I'm
02:58 - on the team page right now okay and
03:00 - that's registering should be on the map
03:02 - yep that's where I am so now when I go
03:06 - let's say to the about page nothing is
03:10 - nothing has happened it's not coming up
03:12 - that it's about I can go over here
03:14 - courses events none of these are
03:18 - registering and so we are getting like
03:25 - an accurate count of how many people are
03:28 - coming to view the site but we're not
03:29 - getting an accurate count of how many
03:32 - pages on the site they're visiting all
03:34 - right we only get that first page you
03:37 - and then if they happen to do a refresh
03:40 - a full page refresh to manually then we
03:44 - get that all right but it would be nice
03:47 - to know you know all the other pages
03:49 - that they go to so that's what we want
03:55 - to set up and normally I've set this up
04:00 - for single page apps before where you
04:03 - have client side riding without a page
04:05 - refresh and it's not really huge do you
04:07 - just modify the code but in this case we
04:11 - have to be careful
04:15 - we we don't want this to run on the
04:20 - server side and we don't want to in
04:23 - particular we don't want to look for let
04:26 - me show you the code so you know talking
04:28 - um what we're gonna do sorry I was just
04:34 - kind of rush getting ready so I got it
04:36 - I can't remember where my windows are
04:39 - okay so what we need to do is look up
04:44 - basically like the path name so it will
04:46 - be something like instead of we're going
04:49 - to get rid of this code actually and try
04:52 - something different but you know we
04:54 - would make basically make a page you
04:57 - mean you know when we get the path name
05:01 - so we would look at window dot location
05:02 - dot path theme well on the server there
05:06 - is no window objects right so I don't I
05:10 - don't know for sure if that would create
05:12 - an error and mess the site up or if it
05:15 - just wouldn't log anything but I don't
05:16 - want to take that risk
05:17 - and and try to run this so I'm not my
05:23 - first idea when earlier today was well
05:28 - you know let's just you know through
05:30 - this code you know edit this code a
05:32 - little bit and we'll throw it in on you
05:36 - know some point like component did mount
05:38 - or something like that and we'll see
05:40 - what happens but I thought no I don't
05:43 - really want to to risk you know messing
05:46 - anything up I I wish we would have had
05:49 - time to test this out more beforehand we
05:51 - don't so now at some point we're going
05:53 - to have to put this on the live site to
05:55 - see if we're really getting any reading
05:57 - and Google Analytics at some point I
06:01 - would like to set up maybe a parallel
06:03 - site so that I could you know do some
06:06 - testing on that but you just don't have
06:08 - it right now so here's what I'm thinking
06:11 - I went on to some using next Jas before
06:17 - I go any further I'm just going to check
06:18 - hey everybody I have some people in the
06:20 - live chat that said hi so I don't want
06:21 - to ignore him hey it was somebody from
06:23 - the Philippines awesome okay all right
06:31 - so we're using next Jas that's what so
06:34 - we are using react but next Jas is
06:37 - basically kind of like a way to scaffold
06:40 - your react
06:42 - app so it sets up a lot of stuff for you
06:45 - like server-side rendering and routing
06:48 - although we are doing some custom
06:49 - routing it it does handle a lot of a lot
06:53 - of those things that might be difficult
06:54 - especially if you're first starting out
06:56 - with react you know you don't really
06:59 - need to know how all that stuff works to
07:01 - be able to make something with reacts I
07:03 - could really bog you down from from
07:05 - being able to try it out so it's really
07:07 - good if you used create react app before
07:09 - it's they're comparable things they both
07:14 - let you get started with react quickly
07:17 - so normally in a react project we'd
07:21 - probably be using something like react
07:23 - router and then there are really
07:25 - specific instructions for how to get
07:27 - Google Analytics working with react
07:29 - router but with next I haven't been able
07:33 - to find specific instructions so what I
07:37 - did find is an issue about adding the
07:41 - script tag so I assumed other people had
07:43 - the same issue and that was correct
07:45 - assumption so a lot of people have also
07:48 - been dealing with this and some of the
07:52 - things like this this uses Google tag
07:54 - manager well we're not using Google tag
07:56 - manager so I'm not going to try that one
07:59 - obviously um there's some other
08:04 - solutions like down here it looks like
08:07 - this is working when you use react - GA
08:13 - or - GA so I decided to take a look at
08:17 - that I looked at how he implemented it
08:20 - here let me blow this up so far so you
08:23 - guys can can see it a little bit better
08:27 - uh this site that he's referring to the
08:31 - he built but it's pretty awesome and
08:34 - intricate but there's so much other
08:37 - stuff going on that it's hard for me to
08:39 - follow so it's not really a good example
08:42 - for me to use you know because this is
08:44 - this has a lot of other stuff built into
08:46 - the way it's doing things is so
08:48 - different so luckily recently within the
08:53 - last couple of weeks
08:55 - someone posted this so this is what
08:58 - we're going to try I'm not entirely sure
09:02 - exactly where all this stuff goes to be
09:04 - honest with you but hey that's that's
09:07 - how it is sometimes so this is going to
09:10 - be a little bit of I'm not really sure
09:13 - how this is going to work out but I want
09:15 - to get this working before I leave today
09:17 - and I'd like to leave early since I put
09:20 - in so much extra time the last few weeks
09:22 - so let's get started all right so I'm
09:34 - going to move this out of the way for a
09:36 - second so we can go over to the code and
09:38 - I'm going to bring this over um let's
09:45 - see
09:49 - lost my lost my window again sorry let
09:56 - me bring this I think I pulled it out so
09:59 - I would have it ready and I lost it here
10:01 - we go okay just to show you what we're
10:04 - going to use this is it so it's it's a
10:07 - package NPM package here that's
10:11 - specifically for using google analytics
10:13 - with react so we're not since we're
10:18 - using it in a specific way with next I
10:20 - don't really think a lot of this
10:22 - documentation is going to be that
10:25 - helpful for us I did skim a little bit
10:28 - honest I didn't I didn't really read the
10:30 - whole thing in a detailed way so we're
10:36 - going to install this and then we're
10:37 - going to apply try to apply it from that
10:42 - example that I showed you a second ago
10:44 - alright so let's pull over our command
10:47 - line so we can install this I was really
10:51 - trying to find a way to not have to
10:53 - install another package because that
10:54 - means I would have to install it on the
10:56 - server as well so that would be you know
10:58 - a few more seconds of downtime for the
11:01 - site when I update this I'd rather not
11:03 - have any downtime so until I get the
11:07 - setup where I can
11:08 - switch off between two versions of the
11:10 - site and have no downtime every time we
11:13 - do an update there's going to be is
11:16 - usually somewhere between 30 and 45
11:18 - seconds of downtime if somebody's
11:20 - already on the site or has been on the
11:22 - site some of that's already cached since
11:24 - we're using that Service Worker so they
11:28 - may not realize the downtime or it may
11:31 - only be for a few seconds for them but I
11:34 - still would rather not have any all
11:37 - right so we're here in in our folder for
11:42 - our local version of this site and we're
11:49 - using yarn so we're not going to do an
11:51 - NPM install we're going to use yarn if
11:53 - you're not familiar with yarn I think I
11:57 - don't know if I liked it or not in the
11:59 - description but you can look up yarn it
12:01 - does the same thing as NPM but I think
12:03 - it's a little bit faster so I've been
12:07 - using yarn yarn so we're going to do
12:11 - yarn ad and we want react GA okay so
12:25 - that's done that's good now we can move
12:28 - this over and let me bring back and
12:36 - bring back this just to say this you can
12:38 - see it in case you're just you're just
12:40 - tuning in and you missed it
12:41 - I'll make this bigger well I was a lot
12:44 - bigger
12:44 - oh there so this is basically what we
12:49 - want to do we're going to import this
12:51 - this reactivated we just downloaded and
12:57 - we want basically these two functions
13:00 - okay so this we probably don't need to
13:03 - keep this this is just a chrome solo
13:04 - this will tell us it's working which is
13:06 - good we want to initialize this with our
13:10 - specific code so the each analytics
13:14 - property has its own code so we're going
13:17 - to put our own code in there and then
13:19 - this is what we'll actually log
13:21 - Paige you so remember I said we're going
13:23 - to look up we want the pathname alright
13:26 - so since it's not really a real page
13:28 - refresh all right we need to look up
13:31 - what the URL is manually and then we're
13:36 - going to set that as the page you
13:38 - instead of the default and then on
13:41 - component did mount we're going to
13:43 - initialize it and then log it so it's
13:46 - pretty straightforward pretty simple if
13:49 - you've worked with Google Analytics
13:51 - before and done any type of single page
13:53 - application with analytics like this is
13:56 - not new stuff I just haven't done this
13:59 - before with next so hopefully it all
14:04 - works I also haven't worked with react
14:06 - GA before so what I'm assuming happens
14:10 - like I said I didn't read thoroughly
14:12 - through everything what I assume happens
14:15 - is that there's something going on here
14:16 - that will make sure that this doesn't
14:19 - mess anything up when it we try to
14:21 - render on the server side so I I assume
14:26 - that simply because a lot of the
14:28 - discussion on that that thread on that
14:30 - issue and github was about that about
14:32 - this not running on the server so that's
14:37 - why I'm maybe it's not a safe assumption
14:39 - but we'll find out all right so I'm
14:43 - going to move this over so we can go
14:45 - over to our code what I do want to keep
14:58 - so let's let's just go to we want to go
15:01 - to one of these interior pages I guess I
15:03 - guess it doesn't matter we go to any of
15:04 - the pages but I'm just going to go to an
15:05 - interior page here and see how this
15:13 - works okay so I just pasted this in here
15:19 - hopefully actually not worked with like
15:27 - multiple exports here so this is what
15:30 - I'm a little bit not I'm not clear on
15:33 - and you guys are going to see my my
15:37 - inexperience here with this come out so
15:41 - if anybody is watching this and saying
15:43 - like where what are you doing dude just
15:46 - let me know let me know if I'm going
15:48 - wrong here because I'm not super
15:51 - confident what I'm doing and remember
15:53 - this this show is not about me being an
15:55 - expert at teaching people this is about
15:58 - giving everyone a glimpse into what I do
16:01 - as just one you know front-end developer
16:05 - day-to-day and hopefully we both learn
16:07 - from each other when we do it but I
16:09 - can't guarantee that I'm always showing
16:11 - the best way to do things it's just the
16:14 - way that I'm using to get the job done I
16:17 - did have some people talking a lot yet I
16:19 - don't want to ignore it completely so
16:21 - I'm just going to take a few seconds
16:22 - just to check out what's going on here
16:24 - especially since I asked if anybody knew
16:27 - what was going on Oh awesome so
16:36 - humberto actually a bear to let me know
16:38 - should I pronounce the H at the front of
16:40 - your name or should it be more like
16:42 - Umberto like a silent H I can't I'm not
16:46 - sure so let me know I want to pronounce
16:48 - it correctly because I know I I know you
16:50 - you watch frequently but anyway Humberto
16:55 - said he's giving me a daily boost of
16:59 - confidence said what I'm doing is
17:00 - amazing on this site and to keep it up
17:04 - so I appreciate that
17:06 - that's stuff like that makes me want to
17:09 - keep doing this if it
17:11 - any point I think that this isn't really
17:14 - helpful for anybody then I probably
17:16 - won't do it but as long as somebody's
17:17 - getting some benefit from this
17:19 - i-i'll keep doing it and I suppose as
17:23 - long as my boss is cool with it I'll
17:25 - keep doing it okay so he also says he's
17:33 - only used on that framework but it found
17:35 - ways to incorporate things that I'm
17:37 - doing so awesome and I went into
17:42 - listening look so that's cool yeah
17:45 - actually uh I've had I've had to work
17:48 - with dotnet stuff just like just a
17:50 - little bit like super minimal with.net
17:53 - stuff and I'm I'm just like I know
17:57 - enough to like edit little things on the
17:59 - site but I really don't know exactly
18:01 - what's going on when you talk that stuff
18:03 - so that's that's really cool maybe when
18:05 - I have to do some dotnet stuff then you
18:07 - could you could help me out and I'll
18:10 - definitely stream that Jimmy says please
18:14 - monetize so I can watch an ad haha okay
18:21 - when I help with this okay all right
18:24 - till Umberto says it is a silent age so
18:30 - I apologize for pronouncing the H before
18:32 - I will remember that and it from now on
18:34 - it will be unbearable and no age someone
18:41 - asked if I know how to work with laravel
18:42 - I do not know how to work with Laura
18:44 - Bell the only guy know about Laura Bell
18:46 - and hopefully this is right is that it's
18:49 - it's a PHP framework correct I have
18:53 - worked with PHP before but usually only
18:55 - in the context of WordPress or making
18:58 - like a little file uploader or something
19:01 - for for a small site so that's that's my
19:06 - extent of my PHP knowledge okay I'm
19:13 - going to go back to this and see so
19:18 - basically I just copy paste this into
19:19 - here I suspect there's a way that this
19:23 - can
19:24 - just be somehow in its own component and
19:26 - we can import this and not have to
19:29 - include this on every page but at least
19:31 - for the purposes of testing this a
19:33 - little bit let's just put it here and
19:36 - see if we can get maybe this console.log
19:39 - to come up when we test it all right so
19:43 - this is going to be here now we need the
19:45 - component did melt which we're not we're
19:47 - not calling that on this page yet so
19:51 - let's pull that in and we're going to
19:58 - put that inside this component here and
20:06 - the other thing we need I'm at might as
20:08 - well put this in now although it doesn't
20:10 - really matter when we're testing locally
20:12 - is I need that that code and like an
20:16 - idiot I look down at the bottom when my
20:18 - foot is and another component here it is
20:20 - alright so I'm going to grab this code
20:25 - hopefully this this works and we don't
20:30 - have to spend a whole lot of time
20:32 - troubleshooting it although it might be
20:34 - a more interesting video if it doesn't
20:36 - work all right so I'm going to save that
20:38 - and we'll go over to our site here and
20:43 - I'll bring up dev tools so I think I
20:46 - already have it up somewhere let's see
20:48 - here it is okay we're going to go over
20:50 - to our console and we're going to
20:55 - navigate to the about page and see if we
20:59 - get a pitch it should say something here
21:01 - in the console what are we looking for
21:04 - ga and knit we did not get it let me
21:12 - still and get it okay didn't get it so
21:21 - it did not work right off the bat so we
21:27 - also I mean we didn't get any crazy
21:28 - errors either in Quetta kinetics
21:33 - monstrance why are we getting this um
21:37 - we are getting a 404 error which is
21:44 - crazy haha all right so this is like I
21:57 - don't know if anybody caught the really
22:01 - dumb thing I just did but I tried to
22:04 - check it on the live site instead of on
22:06 - the test site so sorry about that little
22:09 - ASA time let's bring over the test site
22:12 - now so I'll have a lot of windows open
22:18 - I'm sure I'm sure somebody else can
22:21 - relate to having a million tabs open and
22:23 - windows open so here is the site we
22:28 - really want to test and I will open
22:30 - analytics here I do want to check why
22:33 - I'm still getting an error on on that
22:42 - because I think I was good yeah I got
22:47 - that error earlier and I fixed it so
22:49 - maybe it's just some caching stuff okay
22:53 - so we want to go to about I mean bring
22:56 - up analytics we want to check the
22:58 - console so again let's let's try this
23:06 - all right we got it okay so we did get
23:09 - this ga in it okay and that was
23:13 - obviously a client-side route and there
23:17 - one of the ways that we know that is
23:19 - none of this stuff left the console
23:24 - normally when you do a refresh unless
23:26 - you have it set to persist your console
23:28 - all this stuff will go away on a refresh
23:31 - what is of it okay
23:35 - all this stuff is coarse hairs going on
23:40 - for images so for some reason it's set
23:45 - on where these images are to not accept
23:49 - requests
23:50 - from localhost I guess so it doesn't
23:55 - really matter for testing right now all
23:58 - right so that's awesome so that's
24:01 - working let's put it on a couple of
24:04 - pages just to double-check and see that
24:07 - it in fact is still working and we're
24:10 - not messing anything out by including
24:11 - this stuff in the head I mean I'd rather
24:14 - have this separately but for now I want
24:17 - to get this up and running quickly and
24:18 - can always refactor and make it look
24:22 - nicer later on and I know I always say
24:27 - that and then sometimes I never get to
24:29 - it but at least we'll try to get to it
24:39 - all right so let's try the team page and
24:49 - what else do I have open index okay
24:57 - that'll be good three pages will be good
24:58 - now what we also need to do is put those
25:02 - functions and component did Malthus
25:05 - function calls so where's my is my
25:08 - original page so I know in index I
25:12 - already have component amount so I'm
25:14 - just going to copy the calls I I guess
25:20 - it doesn't really matter the order right
25:21 - now and I'm also calling it on the team
25:26 -  okay and if you didn't watch the
25:29 - video on making jQuery work with react
25:32 - that will explain why I have these calls
25:35 - here to these functions this is to make
25:38 - the jQuery stuff work that I was already
25:41 - using on the site to make sure it works
25:44 - when we do client-side routing I it
25:47 - works already when you're doing a you
25:49 - know full page refresh okay so you got
25:53 - all those we have it on three pages so
25:57 - about the index page was the home page
25:59 - and then the team page so let's click
26:02 - around and see what happens
26:04 - so I scan go let's go to the home page
26:07 - alright we got it
26:08 - we have that in it console.log let's go
26:12 - to the team page alright great we got in
26:17 - it I don't know if you caught that but
26:18 - we before I got all this stuff we did
26:21 - get the anit I'm not gonna scroll but I
26:27 - saw it happen so let's go back to the
26:30 - about page okay and I'm just going to go
26:33 - back up alright great so we know we can
26:35 - we can go back and forth from pages this
26:37 - is firing again it's working again we're
26:40 - not getting any weird errors at least
26:44 - related to that we're getting a lot of
26:45 - other weird stuff going on with errors
26:49 - you can you can check the live site
26:51 - we're not getting all these errors in
26:52 - the live site so that's why I'm not
26:54 - worried about it alright so I think the
26:57 - next step here is let's put this on all
27:00 - the pages and let's push it to the live
27:03 - server and we'll give it a test and I
27:07 - have the link to the live site if if you
27:12 - want to check out the site I also have a
27:14 - link to the github repo if you want to
27:15 - follow along in the description for this
27:17 - video okay let me grab this part again
27:23 - and luckily we don't have that many
27:27 - pages so we can see one students who
27:31 - have only have like five five pages
27:34 - not bad for copy and paste let's throw
27:38 - that end and here
27:52 - and we're not actually using the single
27:56 - news page right now if you remember we
27:58 - didn't have content to fill this out so
28:00 - we just left it out the whole the whole
28:04 - news actually affect the news page and
28:06 - single nerves are completely left out
28:09 - but we ought to just put it in here
28:12 - while we remember what you know how
28:14 - we're doing this
28:17 - you never know I'm like when that
28:20 - finally does get added into the site
28:21 - where we get the content I might forget
28:23 - how I did this so I guess I could go
28:26 - back and watch this video and now I just
28:30 - want to pull I'm just going to pull
28:33 - these think a lot of these pages are
28:35 - more to use and component did mal okay
28:40 - yep let me just close some of these so
28:53 - we can see see what's going on
29:03 - okay
29:05 - you
29:44 - all right and I think that's all the
29:46 - pages so I'm going to push this to the
29:52 - server I'm going to save it I'm going to
29:54 - push it to github and then from github
29:56 - we're going to pull it to the server so
29:58 - if you've been watching you've probably
30:00 - seen me do this several times already at
30:02 - least so but if you haven't what then
30:06 - you're not sure how to do this part
30:09 - you're not familiar with git then I'll
30:11 - just go through it again
30:13 - so do get status it tells us everything
30:18 - that's changed so all our pages
30:20 - obviously but if you remember we added a
30:23 - new package that react GA package so
30:26 - that's why our yarn lock file which
30:29 - keeps track of package versions and
30:31 - things and that we never actually added
30:33 - this directly and then our package JSON
30:35 - file which we can edit directly but we
30:38 - don't often those also change so those
30:43 - are being included if you notice the
30:44 - package itself is not included and we
30:47 - don't upload our node modules to to get
30:51 - up that's pretty standard you don't have
30:53 - to upload them all because as long as
30:54 - you have this package JSON anybody
30:57 - yourself could you could load that on a
30:59 - different machine or anybody could load
31:01 - this and then just with that package
31:03 - JSON file be able to install all the
31:05 - dependencies so just a little a little
31:10 - tip I mean I'm sure you could push your
31:13 - node modules up if you wanted to but
31:15 - that would it would just be out of a
31:16 - waste of time all right so now we're
31:20 - going to commit and I'm just going to do
31:25 - one commit message for all of this since
31:27 - it's all basically the same same thing
31:37 - all right that that's not the most
31:40 - descriptive thing in the world but
31:44 - sometimes it's hard to come up with good
31:46 - commit messages or function names when
31:49 - I'm on the spot on YouTube so we're
31:54 - going to get push
31:59 - okay oh no what happened oh no this is
32:09 - awesome that this happened though okay
32:10 - because this is if this has never
32:14 - happened to you before if you haven't
32:15 - used it that much then you can you can
32:19 - learn from from my mistake from me
32:24 - alright so sorry I can see that there's
32:30 - post to the live chat sorry for ignoring
32:32 - this I will check it when we're done
32:35 - with this I'll go through I'll read
32:37 - everything so if you stick around if you
32:38 - can stick around I'll answer any
32:41 - questions that you put in there and if
32:43 - you can't stick around you can watch the
32:44 - recording and I'll answer it then so I
32:49 - had edited on Saturday I worked from
32:52 - home and I had made some changes to this
32:55 - site I pushed it to get up and then I
32:58 - pulled it into the server I forgot to
33:01 - pull those changes back down to my local
33:04 - copy here at work so what's going to
33:07 - happen now is it has to to merge okay so
33:12 - this is a pain when this happens and it
33:15 - could have been avoided because I think
33:17 - it's to maintain a good a good rule that
33:22 - I tried to have and I always forget is
33:25 - every day I should come in and start by
33:28 - doing a get pool even if I can't
33:30 - remember making changes I ought to just
33:32 - do get pool because maybe I did make
33:33 - changes and I didn't remember like like
33:35 - today so and then you avoid that and
33:38 - everything will be fresh so so now it's
33:47 - time to pull these changes down actually
33:54 - I can't believe it let me do maybe it
33:57 - didn't haha it didn't I didn't even
34:01 - notice it earlier sorry if I'm being a
34:03 - weird here I'm just I'm laughing at
34:06 - myself I try to make it get push um
34:09 - earlier
34:10 - and I didn't even realize that it got
34:13 - rejected because I didn't pull yet so
34:15 - earlier in this in the show when I I was
34:18 - looking at the live site and I was like
34:20 - why is that air there I fixed that well
34:23 - it's because it hadn't actually I
34:26 - actually went through the process
34:27 - I thought of pushing it and then pulling
34:29 - it into the server but I pulled in
34:30 - nothing to the server there are no
34:31 - changes because it never went up so
34:34 - sorry if you're not familiar with git
34:36 - and you have no idea what I'm talking
34:37 - about sorry for being confusing but
34:39 - let's do this properly now and let's do
34:43 - a merge okay so we'll go through just to
34:48 - let you know what this error message is
34:50 - okay so the remote has stuff that I
34:53 - don't have locally we don't want to you
34:58 - know we want to sort out what should
35:00 - actually be there in case there are
35:02 - conflicting changes we want to go
35:04 - through those and figure out what should
35:06 - should actually be the change so we're
35:09 - going to do a get pool and now it's
35:16 - going to bring up I have set as my
35:18 - default for this atom it might be
35:21 - different for you maybe it'll be Nano
35:23 - right in your text right in your editor
35:25 - or if you're using some other code
35:28 - editor
35:28 - maybe you're awesome and use them who
35:32 - knows so this this is you're just going
35:38 - to type a message here to explain why
35:40 - you're merging and I'm just going to say
35:48 - merging
36:00 - okay I mean that's pretty much exactly
36:03 - why so now I'm just going to save this
36:05 - and that should be X I can't do I need
36:10 - to say maybe I need no all right so I
36:12 - need to save and I need to close and
36:14 - then it should it should go through
36:17 - hopefully maybe not honestly I have
36:32 - messed this up before so I'm not super
36:34 - surprised
36:44 - okay so let's alright let's try this
36:49 - again
36:53 - hmm okay so it looks like we have some
36:57 - of the stuff here um let me do a log I
37:06 - haven't done this command before so just
37:08 - to explain git log will show us what
37:13 - we've had what we've done okay yeah so
37:17 - it didn't pick that up somebody saying
37:19 - Patrick saying I have to close Adam no I
37:22 - wish I I don't want to have to close
37:24 - completely close out Adam here um how do
37:29 - I get out of here thank you ski haha I
37:35 - can't figure out how to get out of I
37:37 - can't remember how to get out of log
37:39 - there we go cute that's it okay so maybe
37:47 - since I exit out of there let's let's
37:53 - just see if it makes me do it again
37:54 - local changes so the following files
37:57 - would be overwritten by merge please
38:00 - commit your changes our stash them
38:02 - before you merge all right everybody
38:07 - this is I'm just going to commit these
38:09 - changes
38:10 - I'm afraid it's going to overwrite what
38:12 - we did but since it's not a big deal and
38:15 - it's only those two pages I'm just going
38:16 - to do this please do not use this as an
38:19 - example of what to do use it as an
38:21 - example of what not to do you can see
38:24 - how much of a pain it is if you just
38:26 - don't pull first so I'm usually the only
38:33 - person working on projects so if you are
38:36 - used to working on teams you're probably
38:38 - looking at me like this guy's a noob I
38:41 - just always forget to pull because it's
38:43 - always usually me working on it and
38:45 - usually from one computer so this is
38:48 - something I don't even really need to do
38:49 - that often oh let's just say so I don't
39:00 - even remember exactly what I changed
39:02 - before okay
39:05 - your branch or dementia have diverged
39:07 - they have three and one different
39:09 - committees respectively you get pool
39:12 - okay now it's going to ask me to do this
39:17 - again okay um I don't even odds alright
39:32 - that's a horrible message but it's it's
39:35 - not descriptive at all but I just want
39:36 - to get through this at this point and
39:39 - let's say that and now I am going to
39:43 - close up this this tab let's see if
39:47 - that's enough to make it work yes it did
39:51 - all right so Patrick a good call on that
39:54 - the problem I had the first time was
39:56 - that I didn't actually close out so if
40:00 - you see like this tab open I should have
40:02 - closed out this whole tab it's that I
40:04 - just closed out this document and that
40:06 - wasn't enough so that was the problem so
40:12 - that that would have been the right
40:13 - thing to do in case you were wondering
40:17 - sorry if I confused you by by messing it
40:20 - all up all right so now we should
40:24 - be able to push actually before we push
40:27 - let's check our files and make sure that
40:29 - our stuff was still there we what did we
40:32 - have changes from pages events and
40:35 - resources so let's just look at one of
40:38 - those events all right we still have
40:42 - everything we need there and actually I
40:46 - remember what I changed so let me look
40:48 - in the events page I added a button with
40:52 - a link here okay we have that button now
40:56 - so everything that was changed is there
40:58 - just wanted to be sure let's make sure
41:04 - there we go all right so now that's
41:07 - there let's go to the server so we're
41:11 - going to have to do one extra step that
41:12 - we haven't done before on the server so
41:14 - I'm already logged in I just use SSH to
41:20 - get into the server I'm gonna nope
41:25 - nothing's coming up when I'm typing so
41:28 - maybe I did get logged up and it's just
41:30 - a little laggy I'm not not gonna realize
41:33 - it I'm going to give it a second if not
41:40 - I can always open up another tab and try
41:43 - to get in that way
41:54 - hmm there we go
41:57 - it probably worked on this one not too
41:59 - all right so I can close this up all
42:03 - right so let's login using SSH and then
42:06 - my user name and the IP address now we
42:12 - you normally use this command so let me
42:14 - bring this command over for you I'm
42:16 - going to copy and paste it this is the
42:18 - command we have been using and it's it's
42:21 - just chained together basically what we
42:24 - need right so we have a we're going to
42:31 - stop our server we're using p.m. 2 to
42:34 - manage that and then we're going to CD
42:36 - we're going to you know go into the
42:38 - react folder per project and then we're
42:41 - going to pull from github and then what
42:44 - we would normally do next is run the
42:46 - bill but since we pulled in another
42:49 - package we need to do something else
42:52 - we need another step in between there so
42:54 - I'm going to go back and we're going to
42:56 - do an NPM install and and then we're
43:03 - going to do the rest of it ok so we need
43:05 - that step otherwise that code we just
43:07 - added when we went to like here when we
43:13 - went to sorry I didn't make this bigger
43:15 - I apologize been doing this whole video
43:17 - and it was probably too small for so you
43:20 - see so we went in and we're called we're
43:27 - trying to import this but it's not going
43:29 - to find it unless we install that first
43:32 - so it's going to read our package JSON
43:34 - file and it's going to see hey at once
43:37 - and once this react GA but we don't have
43:40 - it yet so it's going to install then
43:42 - it's going to go in with the rest of it
43:43 - which is going to build the app again
43:46 - and then it's going to restart the
43:47 - server so let me hit enter and we can
43:51 - watch it work I've been I don't know how
43:54 - much time this MTM extol had hopefully
43:56 - not that much time and we can still be
43:58 - under a minute of of downtime
44:06 - okay so you can see now it's installing
44:09 - it's already done the pool there's the
44:12 - change in the package.json okay so the
44:16 - install went alright
44:18 - mornings are okay as long as you don't
44:21 - have an error the installs usually find
44:23 - that we're building the build process
44:26 - usually is like 30 seconds sometimes a
44:29 - little more and as soon as this gets up
44:38 - there we'll test it assuming that it
44:40 - works then I'll check out the live chat
44:43 - and I have another interview from syntax
44:46 - con this time a short interview from
44:49 - Emily Freeman that I'm going to show
44:52 - here hopefully in a few minutes because
44:55 - hopefully this works and if you haven't
45:00 - seen the previous interviews that I did
45:01 - some last week they're just kind of
45:03 - giving some advice to people who are
45:06 - just starting out in coding alright so
45:08 - this is on line if it says it's on line
45:11 - now let's test it out let me bring over
45:13 - the live site actually I think I closed
45:18 - that window that I had earlier so I'll
45:20 - just bring it up right here catechetical
45:25 - yes alright so it works I'm going to
45:28 - bring up the console if you remember we
45:31 - left that console login which at some
45:34 - point we'll probably take that out but
45:36 - we can see that part's working awesome
45:39 - okay so let me move this here because I
45:45 - want to see if this works so we came in
45:49 - at the home page right and we have here
45:52 - this last year this is the home page now
45:55 - I wish there weren't five users on it
45:57 - right now which it was just us that
45:58 - would give us a better test but
46:00 - basically we know that one of these is
46:02 - probably us so let's click about and if
46:05 - this works we'll see about show up here
46:07 - I guess I can make sure on the console
46:15 - we did get another console here yes and
46:18 - about did show
46:20 - so we have one about let's make sure it
46:22 - just wasn't somebody else coming on
46:24 - we'll click around we have a team we
46:26 - already have one team so it should
46:28 - switch to two here in a second
46:34 - yep to four team nobody's on courses
46:38 - right now so let's go to courses and see
46:43 - if it works here that's you all right
46:46 - awesome okay so there are courses so
46:48 - there we go so it works we now have a
46:52 - proper analytics coming in even when
46:57 - we're just doing client-side routing and
46:59 - there's no page refresh so just to wrap
47:02 - up we're using next js' okay which we've
47:06 - used to pull in you know react and build
47:08 - that out we're using the client-side
47:10 - routing there that comes built in with
47:12 - with next Jas and we've pulled in the
47:15 - package the NPM package react GA and
47:21 - we've just included that on every page
47:25 - just like this is super simple we've
47:28 - included it we have some functions we're
47:30 - initializing and then we're setting the
47:32 - page view to what that current path name
47:36 - is for that window and we're sending it
47:40 - with this function we're sending it to
47:43 - Google and then on component in mount we
47:47 - initialize we run these functions the
47:50 - init function and then with the sin so
47:54 - it actually ended up working exactly
47:56 - like like I thought it would work
47:59 - exactly like we talked about the
48:01 - beginning of the show and that's pretty
48:03 - awesome the biggest challenge was doing
48:06 - a git merge which is embarrassing for me
48:09 - so all right Umberto's says that user in
48:14 - washington is probably an oh cool
48:17 - all right so oh we get we got a couple
48:20 - people in washington it looks like
48:21 - Bellevue Seattle all right so one of
48:24 - these is umberto from from the live chat
48:27 - they're so cool yeah if you're on now
48:30 - you can see yourself your little dot
48:31 - Google Analytics is a huge time
48:33 - thing for me is it's cool to just check
48:36 - out all these maps and see what's going
48:37 - on everywhere so I try to stay away from
48:40 - it when I can otherwise I waste so much
48:42 - time in there
48:42 - oh nice Pat Patrick is this like on
48:47 - point today with with the great advice
48:49 - Patrick says um the little what's that
48:54 - called it's healed it the little Toyota
48:57 - will terminate a frozen SSH session so
49:01 - I'm going to try really hard to remember
49:03 - that because that will be useful for me
49:06 - thank you so let's let me go through
49:14 - some of the stuff in the live chat
49:16 - quickly and see if I can answer your
49:18 - questions before I do the I go to the
49:21 - interview and actually let me bring this
49:23 - up so that I don't forget to do the
49:27 - interview I'm just going to bring this
49:29 - up right now because I did forget
49:33 - previously you can actually kind of see
49:36 - me in the background here in that
49:37 - reflection so all right so let me go
49:42 - through any tips on how to make a
49:49 - nice-looking navbar um
49:55 - I personally I like the material design
50:00 - style and I think it's nice to be able
50:03 - to work from a set of this like
50:05 - established um kind of rules for design
50:08 - guidelines so I would check out a
50:11 - material design documentation on how
50:13 - they do nav bars if you type in material
50:16 - design it should be one of the first
50:17 - things that comes up the official one if
50:19 - you want to use a framework check out
50:21 - materialized as a framework it uses
50:23 - material design and it has nav bars I
50:25 - like to try to start with that and then
50:29 - change it as I need to fit the use case
50:32 - I find that to be a lot easier than
50:35 - trying to start from scratch it does
50:37 - depend on the site I'm going if I was
50:39 - going like a site for me like my own
50:41 - portfolio or something which my own
50:43 - portfolio site is super old I haven't
50:45 - worked
50:45 - like five years so if you go there be
50:50 - kind but if I were doing some site that
50:56 - I had like total artistic freedom with
50:59 - let's say and I could do something crazy
51:00 - maybe I would do something different but
51:03 - normally like on a site for a client or
51:06 - for the college where I work I would
51:09 - probably start with something that's
51:10 - kind of like tested proven like
51:13 - something that users generally expect so
51:17 - that they'll it'll provide them with a
51:18 - familiar user experience they don't have
51:20 - to learn how to use my navigation when
51:22 - they go to the site so hopefully that
51:24 - helped I know that wasn't like really
51:26 - technical if you have some code or
51:28 - something up on github send me a DM on
51:32 - Twitter or in the comments below or
51:34 - something below this video and I'll
51:36 - check it out and I could give you maybe
51:38 - some more detailed tips
51:41 - all right Vladimir says it's a really
51:44 - cool thing by streaming real work
51:47 - awesome I'm glad I'm glad you like it
51:49 - that was probably it's probably one of
51:52 - the few original ideas that I've had
51:54 - that you've seen is the idea to just
51:57 - stream me doing my regular work I don't
51:59 - I at least have never seen anybody out
52:01 - stream the regular work so maybe I'm
52:05 - just probably somebody else out there
52:06 - that was doing it before me but at least
52:10 - from my perspective I did come up with
52:13 - that idea on my own update the live site
52:22 - first I must have been it must have been
52:25 - one of the times where I messed
52:26 - something up and some of the other
52:28 - comments had update the live so first
52:32 - you're hitting a live set oh yeah haha
52:36 - yeah it looks like everybody else caught
52:39 - my mistake except for me and eventually
52:42 - I caught it okay I
52:53 - as who's saying sorry if I'm
52:56 - mispronouncing your first name says can
52:59 - you make a HS make a hoc and wrap the
53:02 - pages in if you don't know HS e is this
53:06 - higher-order component that's that's a
53:09 - good idea
53:10 - and i'ma tell you the only reason that I
53:11 - didn't use high ORAC components here is
53:13 - because I'm still learning about them
53:15 - and I'm not super confident with doing
53:17 - it yet so I've seen examples of other
53:20 - sites and kind of look checked out there
53:22 - the github repos and how they did it but
53:25 - I feel like I keep using this as an
53:29 - excuse but it's totally true because the
53:30 - timeline was so short I really had to
53:32 - stick with things that I like I knew
53:34 - we're going to work I don't like to do
53:37 - that I always do like to kind of push it
53:38 - and do new things but that's just how
53:41 - this worked out so the next project
53:43 - hopefully will have a much more
53:45 - reasonable timeline and I can try some
53:48 - things out maybe like some of your
53:50 - suggestions that you all are putting the
53:52 - live chats and and really kind of make
53:54 - it even better and just expand you know
53:57 - what I'm capable of doing but yeah in
54:00 - general from what I know and what I've
54:02 - seen of higher-order components that's
54:04 - that would have been a good way to go
54:05 - for some of this stuff but I'm like I
54:08 - just don't know enough to have used them
54:09 - confidently okay at least I'm better to
54:23 - saying he knows about the the conflicts
54:26 - in the in the pool stuff so I'm glad
54:29 - it's not just me I cry cronies I don't
54:39 - know how you should say your name but
54:40 - it's it looks like cronies with
54:44 - Tuesday's at the end I says well a
54:46 - one-man team I don't I'm not really sure
54:50 - what you're referring to I don't
54:51 - remember what I was doing at that point
54:52 - of the video so if you're still watching
54:55 - and you won't explain that I can I just
54:59 - I just can't remember what was going on
55:01 - there what that would be referring to
55:03 - Kishor says hello hey how's it going
55:07 - and okay Mossad said can you tell us
55:12 - what you did so far because I joined
55:14 - like five minutes ago so I did do a
55:16 - little recap at the end if you came in
55:17 - after that basically we're using we were
55:19 - using client-side routing so our Google
55:21 - Analytics wasn't picking up all those
55:24 - those jumps between like pages of the
55:27 - site so we just changed how we were
55:32 - loading Google Analytics to be able to
55:34 - pick up all those things so that's
55:36 - really simplified version but if that
55:38 - sounds like something you're interested
55:40 - in check out the replay which will be
55:42 - available about like just a few minutes
55:44 - after this stream ends okay Patrick I
55:49 - was wondering about Patrick says its
55:51 - two-day period not just tilde okay so he
55:55 - says there's there are other commands
55:57 - that work with tilde so good to know I
55:59 - wondered about that I saw the period at
56:01 - the end and I wasn't sure if I was
56:02 - included so if you want to terminate a
56:05 - frozen SSH session Patrick has a good
56:10 - advice here use t oday period and that
56:12 - will terminate it
56:13 - so all right let's say so Paul says cool
56:24 - to watch this live work
56:25 - I'm glad glad you're enjoying it it can
56:28 - be a bit overwhelming on just how much
56:30 - there is to learn for someone who is in
56:31 - a few a few months in I totally
56:34 - understand that yeah I am the only the
56:41 - best advice I could have use I don't
56:42 - worry about trying to learn everything
56:44 - at once you know just take it like
56:48 - whatever you need to know for a project
56:51 - you're working on you know learn that
56:53 - and eventually you'll get a better
56:55 - understanding of of what you need you
56:58 - don't need to know everything there's
57:00 - just way too much out there to know it
57:02 - all and you'll get a feel as you keep
57:05 - doing it you'll get a feel for what you
57:06 - like and what you're good at and that
57:08 - will kind of steer you in the direction
57:09 - of you know where you really want to
57:12 - learn to I think to be really good at
57:14 - something you have to rule out other
57:16 - things at some point because it's just
57:18 - too much to shy
57:19 - be awesome at everything so the more
57:22 - you're into the more you'll get a feel
57:24 - for that but just you know don't don't
57:26 - feel too overwhelmed I mean I don't
57:27 - think everybody knows notice at all you
57:30 - know we there there are people who are
57:32 - just really good at they're in little
57:33 - niche of what they do and they're
57:35 - probably some people who just know a
57:37 - little bit about a lot of things but
57:39 - yeah don't don't worry about it I know
57:41 - it's a lot to know but you know you'll
57:44 - look back in a couple months and think
57:45 - like man I I know so much more than I
57:47 - did and and it'll be an awesome feeling
57:49 - oh okay so we got an explanation about
57:53 - says well a one-man team he said that
57:57 - because I'm working alone okay
57:59 - awesome sorry I didn't get that at first
58:01 - yeah I guess there are perks to working
58:06 - alone but then also they're not so like
58:12 - there are a lot of sites right now that
58:14 - like let's say I went on vacation and
58:16 - something happened to the site there is
58:18 - no one else here at this university that
58:21 - could fix the site but me because
58:24 - sometimes maybe it's just an access
58:27 - thing or it would take somebody too long
58:30 - to try to figure it out so there's
58:32 - that's not a good thing
58:34 - um but hopefully that's going to change
58:38 - and I will have some other people
58:41 - that'll that'll know what's going on
58:42 - that's part of the reason why I think
58:44 - these videos are so good that somebody
58:46 - could look back on how I built this site
58:48 - and probably get a pretty good idea of
58:51 - what's going on you know from the github
58:53 - repo and from these videos they could
58:55 - piece together most of what they need to
58:57 - know to work on the site so I'm it's
59:01 - it's not really why I'm doing this like
59:03 - completely but it's an extra bonus
59:06 - included so that would be cool to work
59:10 - on a team I think it'd be awesome to
59:11 - have somebody else to learn from and to
59:13 - be able to look at my code and that's
59:15 - what I mean you all are kind of
59:17 - fulfilling that role that functioned for
59:19 - me you know you see what I'm doing and
59:22 - you are giving me so much so many
59:25 - [Music]
59:28 - umberto just said in code comments nuts
59:31 - nuts I
59:32 - I was thinking it in my mind when I said
59:34 - it like that's what comments are for
59:37 - yeah I definitely need to to level up my
59:41 - comment game in my code it's when you're
59:44 - the only person maintaining your code
59:45 - it's so easy to get lazy about comments
59:48 - and style I'm hopefully I'm going to try
59:52 - to get some of the computer science here
59:53 - involved in developing sites so some of
59:56 - them they may actually you know get paid
59:58 - to work um you know work for me and some
60:01 - of them might be interns at that point
60:04 - I'm going to have to really set like
60:06 - this is the style we use for CSS for
60:09 - JavaScript and this is these are the
60:11 - conventions we use and you got to
60:12 - comment everything and I'm going to have
60:13 - to get more disciplined at that point
60:15 - I'm gonna have to probably slow down at
60:17 - first but it probably it'll be better in
60:19 - the long run and if I'm more disciplined
60:21 - about that so so yeah thanks for calling
60:24 - me out on that Umberto it's totally true
60:27 - so that you're I need any better
60:28 - comments all right I think I got it let
60:40 - me read these last few comments I think
60:41 - we're through okay awesome
60:48 - chronic Ronnie's um says he's working on
60:54 - his portfolio he's been working with
60:56 - lamp stack in few j/s so yeah I'd be
61:00 - happy to take a look at your site and
61:02 - just let you know you know what I think
61:05 - also that's also be working on the UJS I
61:09 - hear a lot of good things about it I
61:10 - haven't worked with it yet but at some
61:13 - point I'll probably check it out if I
61:14 - get a chance I just I kind of like I'm
61:18 - torn like do I really want to learn
61:20 - another framework or don't want to just
61:21 - focus on react and try to get good work
61:23 - good with it but at some point I would
61:25 - still like to check out you okay awesome
61:31 - so I'm pretty sure I got through
61:33 - everything if you have a question and
61:35 - you didn't get to answer it put in the
61:36 - comments below
61:37 - if you don't want everybody in the world
61:39 - to be able to see it on YouTube then
61:41 - just send me a DM
61:42 - Twitter my link to my Twitter is in in
61:46 - the description also now that I launched
61:49 - this site I'm going to have a little bit
61:50 - extra time I'm going to start making
61:52 - short tutorial videos and putting it on
61:54 - my youtube channel so if you want to be
61:57 - alerted when those videos come out you
61:59 - can subscribe um I don't really care if
62:01 - you subscribe or not but I'll probably
62:03 - let you know too on on this channel when
62:06 - those videos come out so alright so I'm
62:12 - going to play this video that I've had
62:14 - up on the screen for a while and this is
62:16 - Emily Freeman and I filmed this at
62:18 - sentox con two weeks ago when I was
62:21 - there and she's going to give some
62:24 - advice to two new coders oops
62:30 - and I forgot I need to put the sound on
62:33 - it so hold on a second alright okay so
62:40 - you should be able to hear this now
62:43 - alright so wait what's I'm in like I
62:48 - ripped in for Colorado um here it's a
62:51 - text not giving it song what see doctor
62:52 - actually exam it won't on hope you
62:56 - dumped a me a story of DevOps gone wrong
62:58 - and then the doctor says can taxation
63:00 - and then what else you know from you
63:03 - doesn't uh to what we do with your yeah
63:07 - yeah I am a job in Melbourne I builds
63:11 - ApS services I have figured out a way to
63:14 - make that more in just a minute but yeah
63:17 - in Java for a small company and what's a
63:23 - new technology that you're excited about
63:24 - I don't know if it's like a new
63:27 - technology but I am excited to like just
63:29 - learn another language so I'm gonna jump
63:31 - from last year starting and remains my
63:34 - favorite but then I'm super interested
63:36 - in either picking up like a gun or an
63:38 - elixir something like a little different
63:40 - cool and what advice do you have for new
63:44 - programs just keep going I think it's
63:49 - really easy to get discouraged
63:51 - don't feel like you're the new person
63:53 - and never going to get it but you will
63:58 - be amazed at how much you are overtime
64:00 - and so it's very hard to kind of see
64:03 - your growth when you're in it and so
64:06 - that means finding a mentor or trust
64:09 - appear and to kind of remind you how
64:11 - awesome your arms just keep going you
64:14 - got it thank you yeah all right so oh
64:21 - cool thanks Paul says great interview
64:24 - yeah hopefully that the interview was
64:30 - helpful I have one more interview from
64:32 - syntax Khan to do and I'll probably do
64:34 - that tomorrow
64:36 - so it was great talking with you all
64:42 - there's a lot of good stuff in the in
64:44 - the live chat I'll be back tomorrow same
64:46 - time 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time and like I
64:52 - said let me know let me know if you had
64:56 - any other questions I think I already
64:57 - cover that right I don't repeat myself
64:59 - you know where to put the the questions
65:02 - okay actually I do want to mention this
65:05 - to this good advice Cronus says
65:07 - meetup.com is a great place for people
65:10 - to meet other developers so I haven't
65:13 - been there but I guess check it out and
65:18 - okay you're welcome guys Humberto is
65:20 - saying thanks so anyway I'll see you
65:23 - tomorrow I'm gonna try to head home and
