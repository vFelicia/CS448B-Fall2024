00:00 - jquery comes with a bunch of dom related
00:03 - methods that make it easy to access and
00:05 - manipulate elements and attributes
00:07 - in this video i'm going to talk about
00:09 - getting and setting content and
00:10 - attributes
00:12 - so we have this line that has some html
00:15 - here it's a paragraph tag with a link
00:17 - inside it
00:19 - and then we have a button here so i'm
00:21 - going to use jquery to add a click event
00:23 - here
00:30 - i'm going to use jquery to select the
00:32 - text within this paragraph tag
00:35 - so we see the id is text so i'm going to
00:37 - use a selector to get that so and i'm
00:40 - going to console.log the text so we're
00:43 - going to do console.log
00:45 - and inside the console.log i'm going to
00:47 - do a jquery command
00:51 - so we're going to select the paragraph
00:53 - tag because it has an id of test and
00:55 - then i'm going to use the dot text
00:57 - method
00:58 - this will get all the text within the
01:01 - paragraph tag but it will not get any
01:04 - html within the paragraph tag so let's
01:07 - see what that does
01:09 - so if i click show content
01:13 - oh i was wondering why that didn't work
01:15 - but i forgot to put a pound sign or a
01:17 - hash mark here that's how we're going to
01:18 - select the id to select something an
01:20 - idea to put this this symbol here before
01:23 - it so now let's try it if i click show
01:26 - content
01:27 - it's going to say learn to code with
01:29 - free code camp and as you can see it's
01:32 - not putting any of this anchor tag it's
01:34 - not putting a href stuff like that but
01:37 - if instead of doing text we put html
01:41 - here
01:42 - now it's going to show everything
01:44 - including any html within that so if i
01:46 - click show content
01:48 - now you can see it's going to put all
01:50 - this other html in here if you put text
01:53 - it strips out the html and just put the
01:56 - plain text but if you put html it's
01:58 - going to show all the html we can also
02:01 - get the attribute values so we're going
02:03 - to use the attr method instead of
02:06 - selecting test here i'm going to select
02:09 - the element with the fcc id
02:12 - so that's going to be this link up here
02:15 - so i'm going to get the href attribute
02:17 - i'm going to put attr
02:19 - to get the attribute and then inside the
02:22 - parentheses i'm going to put href
02:25 - let's show that
02:27 - and you can see down here
02:29 - it shows what the link is
02:31 - so we're getting the value from the href
02:34 - tag
02:35 - let's create another button up here
02:37 - instead of show content it's going to be
02:39 - set content
02:41 - and now i'm going to show you how you
02:42 - can actually set the con instead of just
02:44 - getting the text in the html you can set
02:47 - it for this button it's me button
02:48 - button2
02:50 - just copy this here
02:53 - button2
02:55 - and let's select that element
02:57 - with jquery
03:02 - okay so we've selected the test element
03:05 - and now we have the text method but this
03:08 - time we actually put something inside
03:09 - the parentheses when you put something
03:12 - inside the parentheses instead of
03:13 - getting the text we're setting the text
03:17 - so let's try that let me run that
03:19 - oh gotta put the parentheses there
03:22 - okay i'm gonna hit set content
03:24 - and the text changes the free code
03:26 - campaign is awesome so if you put html
03:28 - in here it's not gonna work
03:31 - let's show that
03:33 - now let's try this i'm going to do set
03:35 - content
03:37 - and it's going to actually show the the
03:39 - html tags right in here
03:41 - but if i change this into instead of
03:43 - text i use the html method
03:47 - and now here it's actually going to show
03:50 - up as bold
03:52 - okay i also want to show you how you can
03:54 - update the value of an input field but
03:57 - first i have to create an input field
04:03 - okay now we have this input field where
04:05 - you right now you can put your name and
04:07 - it's it's defaults to my name beau
04:09 - carnes
04:10 - so we are going to make another button
04:13 - where we can set the the value of the
04:16 - input field
04:17 - so i'm going to do some more copying and
04:19 - pasting to add a click event to this
04:21 - third button we're not going to set the
04:24 - html or anything i'm going to put button
04:26 - three here so this is what we're going
04:27 - to do we're going to use the jquery
04:30 - selector
04:31 - we're going to get the input field with
04:33 - the name id instead of using using text
04:36 - or html i'm going to do dot val
04:39 - to change the value okay let's try that
04:43 - if i click
04:44 - set value
04:46 - see the name changes to quincy larson
04:49 - now all three of the jquery methods i
04:51 - just talked about the the dot
04:52 - tax.html.val
04:55 - also come with callback functions the
04:57 - callback functions have two parameters
05:00 - so the first one is the index of the
05:02 - current element and the list of elements
05:04 - selected
05:05 - all the examples i showed we were only
05:07 - selecting one element but you can select
05:10 - all the paragraphs or all the links all
05:14 - the buttons and so you're going to get
05:16 - the index of what so the the callback
05:19 - function is going to give you the index
05:21 - of the current element in the list of
05:22 - elements and the original or old value
05:26 - then if you want you can return the
05:28 - string you wish to use as the new value
05:30 - from the function
05:32 - so let's try that up here i'm going to
05:33 - change this back to text so we're going
05:36 - to put in a callback function
05:38 - so remember the parameters are the index
05:40 - and then we're going to put a ridge text
05:43 - so we have the index in the original
05:45 - text
05:46 - and here's what we're going to put
05:48 - inside the callback function we're going
05:49 - to put return
05:53 - the old text is going to be that orig
05:55 - text
05:57 - plus we're just concatenating strings
05:59 - here so the new text is going to be now
06:02 - this we're going to get this value from
06:04 - down here
06:07 - and we're going to just take off these
06:08 - bold tags also to show the index we're
06:11 - going to put that in parentheses
06:16 - okay so we're now going to set the text
06:20 - of this to this whole thing right here
06:23 - so let's run that to see what happens
06:25 - there
06:26 - i'm going to click the set content
06:27 - button
06:28 - so look what it changed to old text
06:30 - learn to code with free code camp new
06:33 - text free cocaine is awesome index zero
06:37 - let's try something see we have two
06:38 - paragraph tags we have so this is the we
06:41 - have this paragraph and we have this
06:42 - paragraph what i'm going to do instead
06:45 - of selecting the id test i'm going to
06:48 - select just the paragraph tag now let's
06:51 - see what happens
06:52 - set content
06:54 - so look it actually just set content to
06:56 - both paragraph tags
07:00 - and it old text learn to code with free
07:03 - code camp new text free codecamp is
07:04 - awesome index zero old text
07:07 - name
07:08 - new text free codecam is awesome index
07:11 - one it's basically an array and the
07:14 - first index is zero that's the first
07:17 - paragraph tag and the second index is
07:19 - one that's the second paragraph tag but
07:22 - let's just change that back here
07:25 - so you can do that with text html method
07:28 - or the attribute method okay well thanks
