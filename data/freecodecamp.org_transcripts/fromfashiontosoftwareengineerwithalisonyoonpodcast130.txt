03:22 - Allison let's talk about your Early
03:24 - Childhood I always like to do things
03:26 - kind of in chronological order so we
03:29 - don't have to keep jumping back and
03:31 - forth uh but you have a really unique
03:34 - upbringing and uh I want to talk about
03:37 - that because you are an expatriate
03:39 - essentially you're living outside of
03:41 - your country of origin uh maybe we can
03:44 - talk about what your early years were
03:46 - like sure um I was born and raised in
03:50 - South Korea so until I graduated
03:54 - University back in
03:58 - 201 20 12ish yeah something something
04:02 - like around that time um I lived in many
04:05 - different places growing up because my
04:08 - dad was a military officer he's retired
04:11 - now but because he worked as a military
04:14 - officer I moved from City to City quite
04:18 - frequently growing up um
04:24 - and what else I can talk about
04:28 - yeah I mean yeah yeah I I think that's
04:31 - what's unique about my childhood like I
04:34 - always wonder what it felt what it feels
04:36 - like to be just live in one place for
04:40 - many years because For Me growing up the
04:43 - longest time I lived I stayed in one
04:45 - place is about 2 years and I was
04:48 - constantly moving around which was quite
04:51 - challenging for me cuz like for a kid
04:53 - like I have to constantly say goodbye to
04:55 - friends and what I'm used to and then
04:58 - have to go to a new place and then made
05:00 - me friends and just do that again repeat
05:03 - yeah yeah that uh I mean I moved a few
05:06 - times as a kid and I just remember every
05:08 - time I moved and had to say goodbye to
05:09 - my friends it was like absolutely
05:11 - devastating and so I can only imagine
05:13 - doing that every year or two like that
05:16 - has got to be heartbreaking like at some
05:18 - point when you were moving so frequently
05:20 - did you just was there ever a point
05:22 - where you're like I'm not going to
05:22 - bother making new friends cuz I'm just
05:24 - going to be saying goodbye to them soon
05:25 - or how how did that affect you yeah
05:28 - absolutely I I remember I I cried only
05:31 - once in my lifetime because I had like I
05:34 - didn't want to leave my friends and in
05:36 - the school that happened only once when
05:38 - I was in third grade elementary school
05:41 - after that you know never cried and I
05:43 - just kind of accepted it there I cannot
05:46 - fight it you know it's just what it is
05:48 - and this is something I didn't remember
05:51 - myself but a friend of mine from like
05:53 - sixth grade um she told me that I once
05:56 - said that you know what's the point of
05:59 - making really really close friends
06:01 - anyway like we have to say goodbye at
06:03 - some point she told me that I said that
06:05 - when I was when I was in sixth grade and
06:08 - she was very surprised to hear that
06:10 - because I don't know it's not something
06:12 - that you will hear a lot from sixth
06:14 - grade um kids but yeah I think at some
06:18 - point you you just get used to it right
06:21 - your environment and situation so yeah
06:24 - well um I'm sad that you had to go
06:26 - through all that uh but you know it
06:28 - sounds like your dad was doing important
06:29 - work and uh I'm sure he would have loved
06:32 - to just settle down if that was an
06:34 - option I I mean I say I'm sure but uh
06:36 - you know I I don't know very much about
06:38 - your dad but uh I I imagine he didn't
06:41 - want to put you through all that
06:43 - tumultuous uh moving and stuff well I
06:46 - guess one of the benefits is you've
06:47 - lived a lot of places can you talk about
06:49 - some of the different places you've
06:50 - lived yeah so I lived um in Soul and the
06:55 - suburb of soul and one time in kangwan
06:59 - which is like the um East Side from Soul
07:02 - like east coast of Korea and this place
07:06 - where my dad worked at the time was
07:08 - actually very close to like the border
07:11 - to North Korea so um the military
07:14 - hospital that my dad was working at the
07:17 - time would like sometimes get like I
07:21 - don't know if I can mention this but
07:22 - like sometimes get like the dead bodies
07:24 - of like North Korean soldiers you know
07:27 - and and something like that which was
07:28 - really I didn't like think people trying
07:30 - to defect like people trying to leave
07:32 - North
07:33 - Korea I mean because they I don't
07:36 - remember exactly because this happened
07:38 - when I was very young and I didn't pay
07:40 - much attention I had absolutely no
07:41 - interest in whatsoever going on in North
07:44 - Korea and you know the conflict between
07:47 - two countries but um I I think it was
07:52 - the soldiers but again like my memory
07:55 - isn't 100% clear yeah yeah I mean it's
07:59 - it's a conflict that continues to rage
08:01 - on and uh we've talked about it a lot on
08:04 - this podcast because I have tons of
08:05 - friends who had to serve in the military
08:07 - in Korea it's like two years of your
08:09 - life really like the prime years of your
08:11 - life like uh and you just have to go and
08:15 - drop everything and put your life on
08:17 - hold essentially um and uh I guess
08:21 - fortunately like women are currently
08:23 - Exempted from having to do that for the
08:24 - most part right you didn't have to serve
08:26 - in in the the Korean military but like
08:29 - uh a lot like do you have any do you
08:31 - have a lot of friends who had
08:33 - to uh basically if you're are male if
08:36 - you're identified as male then you have
08:39 - to unless you um unless there are I
08:42 - think there are some like conditions
08:44 - where you can be Exempted like
08:46 - healthwise mhm but I don't know um
08:51 - exactly what the conditions are but if
08:53 - you're healthy if you're male then yeah
08:55 - you have to yeah I mean everybody serves
08:58 - like it doesn't matter if if you're in
09:00 - BTS you have to go serve right exactly
09:04 - yeah so uh it's just kind of like Elvis
09:06 - had to serve in the US military when he
09:08 - got drafted right um yeah and he and he
09:11 - went and fought in in the war right uh I
09:13 - can't remember which one I think it was
09:14 - like Korea uh the the Korean uh War uh
09:19 - actually I'm not certain is it early I
09:22 - don't is it that
09:25 - time
09:27 - yeah uh he was yeah 1960s uh yeah Korean
09:32 - war was way before 1960s though yeah so
09:37 - it wasn't the Korean War it was the 19
09:39 - it was
09:42 - um yeah he served from 1958 to 1960 in a
09:45 - tank unit um and it was just like a cold
09:48 - war operation but my understanding is he
09:51 - was drafted uh Elvis recurring character
09:54 - on the freeo camp
09:57 - podcast uh let me see yeah um cuz they
10:01 - still had I think a draft going into
10:03 - this period
10:06 - uh yeah he was drafted to serve and he
10:09 - uh he worked in active duty for two
10:11 - years anyway this is very very uh
10:14 - ancillary details that I'm just looking
10:16 - up on the fly so I apologize he didn't
10:18 - serve in the Korean War that that was
10:20 - early 1950s I believe uh but um but yeah
10:24 - like it's like that uh except it's just
10:27 - never ending like every Korean male uh
10:30 - and it's quite likely you know if your
10:33 - kids have Korean citizenship or or you
10:36 - know your nephews and nieces and stuff
10:38 - that they will also have to serve like
10:40 - there there this conflict probably isn't
10:41 - going to come to an end anytime soon
10:43 - right yeah unfortunately yeah well what
10:46 - were your early aspirations I mean you
10:48 - were moving around quite a bit but what
10:51 - were uh what did you want to do when you
10:54 - when you grew up I don't know about you
10:57 - Quincy but my dream growing up like
10:59 - changes every year I can I can tell from
11:02 - the records or like a diary that I kept
11:05 - when I was young like this year it was
11:07 - scientist next year it was dentist next
11:10 - year it was teacher like it just keep
11:12 - changes and me I don't know cuz when I
11:14 - was young whatever I thought it was the
11:17 - coolest at that moment I would write
11:19 - that as my dream without knowing what's
11:22 - involved to become one um so like really
11:27 - never once in my lifetime grow growing
11:29 - up I thought that I would be a
11:32 - programmer yeah yeah yeah well you went
11:35 - to school for fashion right yes yes I
11:38 - did yeah what was that experience like
11:40 - you went to uh a very famous university
11:43 - in Korea Soul Women's University um what
11:46 - was your time like there yeah so the
11:49 - first time I got interested in fashion
11:52 - is probably when I was a teenager I
11:54 - started reading fashion
11:57 - magazines because in Korea I think it's
12:00 - the same now if you go to middle school
12:03 - and high school most schools require you
12:05 - to wear school uniforms I don't think
12:08 - it's like that in the States but in
12:10 - Korea you each school has school
12:13 - uniform and so like naturally you don't
12:18 - have much freedom on like what you and
12:22 - where and like how you express yourself
12:24 - basically by choing your outfits and use
12:27 - you know your hairstyle and and things
12:29 - like that um and maybe that was why I I
12:34 - was looking for some kind of Outlet you
12:36 - know from like take being taken away
12:39 - this kind of freedom and I really
12:42 - enjoyed it I really enjoyed like every
12:44 - season the runway from like designers
12:48 - you know to show and everything and I
12:51 - think when I applied for fashion major
12:54 - um so finishing up my high school I
12:56 - wanted to become a fashion buyer so it's
13:00 - it's different from designer um is buyer
13:04 - is someone who would go to like
13:06 - different brands and basically like
13:07 - select and buy something that you think
13:11 - what people are going to like this
13:13 - season you know that was that was my
13:16 - goal the time and then I joined I
13:18 - started University and I had a great
13:21 - time uh cuz the school provided me with
13:25 - many different opportunities to be in
13:27 - abroad study abroad doing internship
13:30 - abroad so um yeah had a great time yeah
13:35 - and so it's like so Women's University
13:37 - like is it's only women basically are
13:39 - there very many guys on campus at all uh
13:43 - there are some exchange students so like
13:46 - from different countries different
13:47 - schools who would come to our school and
13:50 - who are boys but um if you are student
13:54 - in Soul Woman's University then you're a
13:57 - woman woman yeah yeah like you know this
14:00 - was in like the you know 201 probably
14:04 - right like so so it's
14:06 - like that that's pretty uncommon to have
14:09 - like just a All Women's University
14:11 - though yeah today but but you had a
14:14 - great time there you told me yeah
14:16 - absolutely I think um I think I really
14:21 - had a great experience doing internship
14:23 - in Paris so I think I was um sophomore M
14:30 - and and then I had a chance to spend
14:32 - like one semester in Paris working for a
14:36 - designer's boutique the time and yeah I
14:39 - mean if you're a fashion student and
14:41 - you're in par is like you in kind of a
14:44 - dream place just like in Devil wor Prada
14:47 - like it it describes how like every
14:50 - woman wants to be there you know kind of
14:52 - it I don't know it it was like a dream
14:54 - at the time yeah devil Weare is part A
14:57 - really exciting movie great performance
15:00 - by Merill stre and uh yeah like they
15:03 - they go to like Paris fashion week
15:04 - that's like the kind of the big climax
15:06 - of the movie it it's a cool movie like I
15:08 - watched it I also watched Zoolander
15:11 - which is maybe like a less realistic uh
15:16 - portrayal of fashion but like my friends
15:18 - all love Zoolander and so we like use
15:20 - Zoolander quotes a lot uh it's also
15:23 - classic movie about the fashion
15:26 - industry but uh that's cool so you you
15:29 - got to go to Paris but like being I
15:32 - imagine the fashion industry is like
15:33 - pretty competitive and also like like
15:36 - because so many people want to work in
15:38 - it it's like working in the game
15:39 - development industry so many people want
15:40 - to build video games that as a result
15:43 - there can be like toxic kind of like
15:46 - work culture and and um and it can also
15:49 - be very clicky where like you have to
15:51 - know somebody to be able to get a job
15:53 - and like like even like lowlevel
15:55 - internships and things like that are
15:56 - coveted whereas you know being like a a
15:59 - general software engineer there's tons
16:01 - of opportunity and you also can
16:03 - potentially have work life balance and
16:04 - things like that was is fashion like
16:06 - that at all am I mischaracterizing
16:08 - fashion or is it extremely competitive
16:09 - like that yeah so um I worked just like
16:14 - very short time after I graduated in a
16:17 - fashion company about like 6 months I
16:20 - believe so like less than a year because
16:23 - I quickly realized how different it was
16:26 - to be in the industry um compared to
16:30 - when I was in school when when I was in
16:32 - school like they encourage you to be
16:34 - creative explore express yourself it's
16:38 - all about that so it's just it's very
16:40 - fun to be in school studying fashion but
16:44 - working in fashion industry is nothing
16:47 - like that um it was very exhausting and
16:52 - like you said you know toxic cuz like
16:54 - when when you're surrounded by unhappy
16:56 - people you know it's not that people
16:59 - want to be toxic but because they are
17:01 - also unhappy and exhausted is it
17:04 - naturally becomes like that you know
17:06 - whole environment and the atmosphere um
17:10 - yeah so that's why I don't know I felt
17:13 - like I I remember I got my paycheck like
17:16 - my first paycheck and second paycheck
17:17 - and every time I see the the money in my
17:20 - bank account I felt like I'm just dying
17:22 - little bit inside and that's you know
17:25 - after a few months I was like no I can't
17:29 - do it I can't do it anymore so I left
17:32 - yeah what is that experience like like
17:34 - youve you've trained for like three or
17:36 - four years to get this degree you did an
17:39 - internship uh you're working in fashion
17:41 - and like to just walk away from that
17:44 - world can you kind of describe like what
17:47 - your thought process was and and where
17:49 - you go from there yeah I
17:52 - think because I didn't have that much
17:56 - and I think it it will be similar to a
17:58 - lot of the students who are in the
18:01 - University right now that um you you
18:05 - don't know what's actually involved to
18:09 - work in that industry that you want to
18:11 - be in because what they teach you in
18:14 - school um doesn't
18:17 - always
18:18 - represent what your day-to-day work is
18:21 - going to be like when you starts working
18:23 - and it could be very different it could
18:25 - be different from what you expect you
18:28 - know and so something that you felt like
18:31 - you know oh this is my calling you know
18:33 - like I'm going to be very good at this
18:35 - I'm going to you know enjoy doing this
18:38 - may if you are thinking that while
18:40 - you're in school maybe there is a chance
18:45 - that you know it's going to be different
18:47 - when you start working it happens a lot
18:50 - I've seen a lot around myself too you
18:54 - know and my friends um so yeah but at
18:58 - the time cuz I was still very young when
19:01 - I I graduated you know one semester
19:03 - early earlier and started working and
19:06 - you know just 6 months after I was still
19:08 - like early 20s so I didn't think too
19:12 - serious I I wasn't afraid to leave at
19:15 - that time cuz I felt like I still there
19:18 - is time for me to explore
19:21 - and I
19:22 - think I'm my personality I when
19:26 - I know that that I want something and
19:30 - when I know that I don't want something
19:32 - like like it's very clear like I don't
19:34 - have to think second you know yeah it's
19:38 - time to like put into an action but I I
19:41 - know that not
19:42 - everybody you know is it's it's not that
19:46 - easy for everyone I know that's just my
19:48 - personality yeah so you're just like a
19:49 - decisive person essentially like like
19:52 - when you feel it in your heart you make
19:54 - a move you don't like just stay in a
19:57 - situation that is not comfortable for
19:59 - you exactly yeah yeah awesome what did
20:03 - you do like you're leaving this industry
20:05 - like how did your parents react if you
20:07 - don't want me asking like that's like
20:09 - yeah what was what was the reaction of
20:11 - your friends and family yeah um my mom
20:15 - suggested that I I stay a little bit
20:18 - longer and see how it goes um my dad
20:21 - didn't say anything because my parents
20:23 - also it's I guess it's their style like
20:26 - they don't really tell me what to do and
20:30 - they just kind of you know let me do
20:34 - whatever I decide to do and I really
20:37 - appreciate that you know when looking
20:39 - back like my parents never really
20:41 - pressured me to do something or study
20:43 - something or go this way that way it was
20:46 - always on me the decision you know and I
20:49 - really appreciate it cuz I know that not
20:51 - everyone gets that kind of environment
20:55 - yeah yeah so from from a like a
20:59 - practical standpoint okay you've decided
21:01 - to leave your parents are on board
21:02 - that's cool uh but you still have the
21:04 - Practical question of like what are you
21:06 - going to do how did you go about
21:08 - evaluating your options and like where
21:10 - do you go from there yeah sure so after
21:14 - I came back from the internship in haris
21:18 - you know like from the day I came back
21:21 - I've only thought about how can I go
21:23 - back because I really Lov the time there
21:26 - um but unfortunately I don't speak
21:29 - French so there there was very little
21:32 - chance that I can be accepted to any
21:34 - kind of school um or just can start
21:37 - working
21:38 - there because of the language barrier so
21:41 - what I did is cuz I I speak English you
21:45 - know I can maybe apply for master's
21:49 - program abroad so I apply for Master's
21:53 - um to when school in the UK to study
21:57 - fashion marketing and I got accepted and
22:01 - then I couldn't go because I couldn't
22:03 - afford a tuition um that
22:07 - happened and then yeah and then after
22:09 - that um I started um volunteering for
22:14 - this like nonprofit organization it
22:17 - turned out it was a nonprofit
22:19 - organization
22:20 - later but yeah volunt started
22:23 - volunteering there and then they that
22:25 - organization sent me to Canada and then
22:28 - to to America to work from you know work
22:31 - in different centers and from there um I
22:35 - spend a lot of time like teaching
22:39 - meditation and also like spend a lot of
22:41 - time doing some graphic design work and
22:44 - web design work for the
22:47 - organization yeah so you you kind of
22:49 - like just through your work there you
22:51 - were able to find Opportunities to learn
22:53 - new skills and some of the skills you
22:54 - learned uh
22:56 - included uh essentially like the
22:59 - precursors of software
23:01 - development yeah I think that's that's
23:03 - how it started because at the time what
23:06 - I taught myself is to um how to make a
23:09 - website using WordPress and then at that
23:12 - time I also taught myself how to like
23:15 - what's HTML what CSS this sort of stuff
23:18 - which was incredibly fun at the time
23:21 - that was the first time um I learned
23:23 - about like how website is made and was
23:26 - behind you know was behind the
23:29 - screen and uh after I came back to Korea
23:33 - so left I left the organization and came
23:36 - back to Korea and then I continued my
23:39 - career with this experience um doing web
23:42 - design so I started working as a UI ux
23:45 - designer awesome what was your first uh
23:48 - uiux development gig was it like a
23:51 - contract for somebody or did you get a
23:53 - job like how did how did you go like
23:55 - okay I've got these skills let's get on
23:57 - the market and let's let's get paid to
23:59 - code
24:00 - essentially yeah so the uiux designer I
24:05 - so my title was designer so programming
24:08 - wasn't part of my day-to-day work but
24:10 - then I still like you know suggested
24:13 - that can I program as well it will be
24:15 - easier for me if I design it and then I
24:18 - can at least do the HTML CSS simple
24:20 - JavaScript you know and then give it to
24:22 - the front end developer that way they
24:24 - will understand better what I want to
24:26 - achieve and also because programming was
24:29 - fun I wanted to do it um so I my first
24:33 - job as a UI ux designer was for this
24:36 - startup um that was their product was to
24:41 - create like this kind of video meting
24:44 - platform at the time and yeah so that
24:50 - wasn't my first job as a developer that
24:52 - was um uiux designer job you said video
24:56 - Nanny no video
24:58 - video meeting sorry video meeting oh
25:00 - okay like video like you can't afford it
25:03 - any but just somebody to watch your
25:05 - kids I just heard video dting sorry
25:07 - about that um but yeah that that's cool
25:10 - wanty is it what you want right now yeah
25:13 - that's what we need for the kids because
25:15 - I'm doing a podcast interview and
25:16 - they're and they're watching Magic
25:17 - School Bus in Chinese of course cuz we
25:20 - only let them watch uh Netflix in
25:22 - Chinese because we want them to improve
25:23 - their Chinese yeah that's like one of
25:25 - those things just immersive they can
25:26 - watch Netflix but it has to be in ch
25:28 - Chinese so they can improve their
25:29 - Chinese nice yeah but but having a video
25:32 - Nanny wouldn't wouldn't be bad I
25:35 - guess stop eating
25:37 - [Laughter]
25:40 - Pop-Tarts yeah okay so so a video
25:43 - meeting platform that's that sounds like
25:46 - pretty heavy duty so what were you
25:48 - building um so the company name was it
25:52 - uh is was Roundy I I I think it's
25:55 - inspired by other company um little few
25:59 - years ago but yeah they were making a
26:01 - like a you know think Google meets right
26:04 - yeah um but they wanted to incorporate
26:07 - like different like features there such
26:09 - as like taking meeting notes and
26:11 - scheduling the meeting like the calendar
26:13 - and like kind of like different
26:17 - participants can create meeting notes
26:19 - together at the same time this and the
26:21 - recording this sort of things yeah yeah
26:24 - that's cool so a lot of features to plan
26:27 - a lot of features to implement how big
26:30 - was your
26:31 - team so it was a startup I was the only
26:34 - designer there and there were um I think
26:39 - six seven Engineers total one frontend
26:43 - developer and two mobile developers and
26:47 - um backend and server Engineers yeah
26:51 - awesome and uh what was it like being on
26:53 - a team like uh because I mean this is
26:56 - probably pretty different from working
26:57 - in fashion like suddenly you're in an
26:59 - office was it like a cubicle layout or
27:01 - did you have offices like did you was it
27:04 - all Co located this or this wasn't like
27:06 - was this a remote job or did you
27:08 - actually report to an office in so this
27:10 - was way before covid so it was in office
27:14 - job not remote job not cubicle it was a
27:17 - startup it was like very
27:19 - casual so like a bunch of tables pushed
27:21 - together essentially no no like you you
27:24 - have your own desk and then like it's
27:26 - not like facing each other but then is
27:28 - opened you know so like you can easily
27:30 - talk to each other and things like that
27:33 - um and yeah like it was very different
27:37 - from the time when I was working for a
27:40 - fashion company because at the time I
27:42 - was like just fresh graduate out of
27:44 - University and then not knowing anything
27:46 - about what it's like to be in the
27:48 - industry and just started working and
27:50 - then you
27:51 - know I guess my expectation and dream
27:54 - just kind of destroyed when I started
27:57 - working uh but this time because I knew
28:01 - better what is involved what what your
28:03 - day-to-day task is going to be like if
28:06 - you are U uiux designer so it was great
28:10 - like I it was fun for me you know I was
28:14 - able to use the skills that I learned
28:16 - throughout the year
28:18 - and it was fun collaborating with others
28:21 - and then especially with other
28:23 - developers together um and the work was
28:26 - never like
28:28 - I never had to work over time which is
28:31 - great it was like the work life balance
28:33 - was great um I think it was yeah I think
28:35 - it was a great first job for me yeah and
28:38 - you got to learn and apply a lot of
28:40 - design principles like I imagine there
28:42 - is some overlap between what you learned
28:44 - at fashion design school and doing web
28:46 - design right like were some of the
28:48 - concepts
28:50 - transferable uh yeah I wouldn't say
28:53 - concepts but some of the things that I
28:55 - learned in school studying fashion um is
28:59 - to use the software like Adobe Photoshop
29:03 - and illustrator this kind of thing and I
29:06 - also taught myself how to use in Design
29:08 - This is another Adobe software um and
29:12 - that skill you know is important when
29:15 - you are working as a uiux designer and I
29:20 - also learn how to use canvas which is an
29:23 - app in in Mac basically like Photoshop
29:26 - or illustrator like graphic design tool
29:29 - yeah so that skill is transferable not
29:33 - very much the concept but then also I um
29:36 - took some classes and courses to learn
29:39 - more about UI design before I got this
29:42 - job so that was also helpful yeah how
29:46 - did you get the job was it were they
29:48 - like did they ask you questions like oh
29:49 - but you saided fashion why are you
29:51 - applying to be like a web designer like
29:54 - what was the application process like so
29:57 - I I it it was like a startup job fair
30:01 - that I went and then I was really
30:03 - interested in this specific company so I
30:05 - scheduled an appointment with him you
30:07 - know how like in job fair there are
30:09 - different Booth of companies so these
30:11 - was all like startups and then they
30:14 - would say that we are looking for this
30:16 - kind of person or this kind of skill set
30:18 - right so um I I sent my CV and then just
30:23 - went to the job fair and then met with
30:25 - them in the booth and then Lu the the
30:28 - CEO of the company
30:31 - um uh he like he he think I will be very
30:35 - qualified so he just got me the job then
30:38 - and there wow so your career transition
30:42 - if if I can recapitulate I just want to
30:44 - make sure I'm getting this right like
30:47 - you you left fashion school or like I
30:49 - guess you finished did you you finished
30:51 - school I I fin I finished the school
30:53 - yeah yeah and and like you couldn't
30:54 - afford to go get a master's degree uh so
30:58 - you you just traveled around and worked
31:00 - for this organization and uh de like
31:03 - learned the skills on your own
31:05 - essentially and then when you got this
31:06 - was this in Korea or that you got the
31:10 - that you got the first job the first job
31:13 - yeah in Korea yeah so you just walked
31:15 - into basically a job fair you were
31:17 - prepared you had your CV um and you kind
31:19 - of knew what you were looking for and I
31:22 - mean did you apply for a lot of other
31:23 - jobs or was this just kind of like a
31:26 - very fortuitous
31:28 - like job search yeah definitely
31:30 - definitely actually like before I appli
31:33 - for this job I worked in different
31:35 - company just for a month as a frontend
31:37 - developer MH um but then that company
31:41 - was like very very small and they didn't
31:45 - have enough funding so you know my uh my
31:49 - classmate at the time who had loads of
31:51 - experience working experience in
31:53 - different um industry I mean he was
31:57 - still like programmer but not a front
31:59 - endend developer you know what I mean
32:01 - like a server developer or something so
32:03 - he he understand the industry and he can
32:06 - like see the company so he I kind of
32:08 - described what it's like and then he
32:10 - told me maybe it's a good idea to look
32:13 - for a different place cuz it doesn't
32:15 - sound very stable so that's what I did
32:17 - and that's how I got this job yeah
32:20 - that's good that you had people looking
32:21 - out for you and saving you from like I
32:23 - mean it does happen sometimes you get a
32:25 - job at a startup and they run out of
32:26 - money but they don't tell you they ran
32:28 - out of money and next thing you know
32:29 - you've got they're like Hey where's my
32:32 - uh where's my paycheck and like oh it's
32:33 - we're a little bit behind and then next
32:35 - thing you know you worked like you know
32:37 - a month or two without any sort of
32:39 - compensation at all to show for it right
32:41 - that does happen sometimes and it sounds
32:43 - like you're uh your friend was like
32:44 - looking out for you and making sure that
32:45 - didn't happen to you yeah um this like
32:49 - highlights kind of like a path that a
32:51 - lot of people don't appreciate like just
32:53 - how viable it is uh which is go work at
32:57 - startups like startups you can talk
32:59 - potentially to the top person right the
33:01 - founder or the CEO or or the CTO or
33:04 - somebody like there's not a lot of
33:06 - hierarchy at these organizations and
33:08 - they don't have usually this really
33:10 - regimented hiring process and a lot of
33:13 - times when you can actually talk to a
33:15 - human being they're going to like look
33:16 - at your portfolio and they're going to
33:18 - read your CV whereas if you apply to
33:20 - like IBM or Dell or some giant like tech
33:24 - company you may not hear anything back
33:26 - because the you know that maybe no human
33:28 - even reviewed your application because
33:31 - it just got filtered out by uh you know
33:34 - the software the applicant tracking
33:36 - software ATS systems uh so going
33:39 - directly to a essentially a job fair for
33:42 - startups that we're trying to find
33:43 - people that is like a a very brilliant
33:46 - kind of like round like a way to go
33:51 - around the uh very difficult process of
33:54 - getting a first developer job and it
33:55 - sounds like you've done a little bit of
33:57 - development work you weren't coming in
33:58 - completely cold but that's really cool
34:00 - tell me about your experience so you
34:01 - said it was called like roundly what
34:03 - what was the name of the company yeah
34:05 - Roundy um round e round e was the
34:08 - product name and the company name was
34:10 - linear Hub at the time linear Hub okay
34:13 - but is acquired by different companies
34:15 - so I don't think it's that name anymore
34:18 - okay yeah yeah that that's cool that
34:20 - that always happens to linear
34:23 - hub.com uh yeah it looks like it's a
34:25 - completely different product uh but uh
34:28 - okay that's cool so while you were
34:31 - working there um how long did you stay
34:33 - at this company did Were You There When
34:35 - They got acquired or no no no that it
34:39 - happened a few years after I left yeah
34:42 - yeah so and I I worked for this
34:45 - company
34:47 - for a little bit over a year so until we
34:52 - moved to the UK in 201 yeah tell me
34:55 - about that move like what precipitated
34:57 - you moving when you say
34:58 - we yeah me me and my husband and our
35:02 - dog okay very cool yeah so so you and
35:06 - your husband decided to move to the UK
35:08 - big decision how are you able to move to
35:11 - the UK cuz like moving to a different
35:13 - country uh can be tricky like
35:17 - immigration wise and stuff yeah yeah so
35:21 - my husband is um is Korean ameran and we
35:25 - met in Korea um got marri married in
35:28 - Korea and he was staying in Korea for a
35:31 - few years when we met he was going to um
35:35 - Language Institute to learn Korean
35:37 - language because he didn't have the
35:38 - chance to learn growing up in the states
35:41 - and um he told me like many times how he
35:46 - wants to go to graduate school you know
35:48 - because he he has degree in physics um
35:51 - MH but he doesn't want to pursue his
35:53 - career in physics and in Korea he was a
35:56 - lot of the a lot of English speakers in
35:59 - Korea um the jobs can they can have is
36:03 - either like teaching English or you know
36:06 - get a job at school uh he was working as
36:09 - an essay tutor so like a College admin
36:14 - Administration helper or teacher
36:16 - instructor so like basically someone who
36:18 - helps kids writing an essay applying
36:22 - applying to American
36:23 - colleges um but he didn't see himself
36:27 - doing that job for many many years that
36:28 - was just always a temporary thing and he
36:31 - wanted to go to graduate school but then
36:33 - there were some huddles like he got very
36:37 - interested in computer programming
36:39 - because we had this chance to like you
36:41 - know let's make an app and let's let's
36:43 - learn like how to you know use this
36:46 - software and then the languages let's
36:48 - you know do it ourselves and he really
36:50 - really loved it and then since then he's
36:52 - like you know I want to do programming
36:54 - but a lot of the American colleges don't
36:57 - wouldn't accept you in master's program
37:00 - if you don't have the same degree in
37:01 - your
37:03 - undergraduates um that was yeah blocker
37:06 - and another blocker is that you have to
37:08 - take gr it's like a test that you have
37:12 - to take if you want to apply to a lot of
37:14 - the Masters program in in the US um and
37:19 - like to study that is also another
37:21 - blocker because it's like you have to
37:22 - really commit like time you know and
37:24 - effort to do that so I because I've
37:28 - already applied to U master's program in
37:31 - the UK years back um I knew that you
37:35 - don't need gr and and a lot of the
37:38 - universities in the UK would still
37:40 - accept you if you have unrelated uh
37:42 - degree in your undergraduate so it was
37:44 - perfect and also he didn't have to take
37:46 - an English test because he American yeah
37:49 - that's
37:50 - true you have to do is just apply you
37:53 - know yeah and and UK is very receptive
37:57 - like I I don't think it's terribly hard
37:59 - for an American to get a US student visa
38:01 - whereas it would it is kind of difficult
38:03 - sometimes for Koreans to get us student
38:06 - visas for example um and especially
38:09 - people from like China India places like
38:11 - that it can be really an Ord deal to get
38:14 - uh a student visa but sounds like the UK
38:17 - was very permissive in giving him a Visa
38:20 - and then how did how did you go over
38:21 - there did you get a did you just come as
38:23 - like the the the spouse of the student
38:27 - yeah so what he got a student visa and
38:31 - because we're married I got the
38:33 - dependent Visa yeah so like I'm not a
38:36 - student but then if you are the
38:38 - dependent if you are on the dependent
38:41 - Visa of someone who has a student visa
38:43 - also he was doing Master's course not
38:45 - undergraduate I think the law changed a
38:48 - little bit now if you are if you have if
38:51 - you are undergraduate student um I don't
38:54 - know if you can still bring your family
38:56 - on dependent Visa or not but if you are
38:58 - doing Masters you can do that um as far
39:01 - as I know and then that for someone who
39:05 - has dependent Visa you can work
39:07 - full-time oh interesting so you had work
39:10 - permission right off the bat when you
39:11 - arrived yes that's great so so you
39:15 - arrive in the
39:17 - UK uh your husband's going to school and
39:20 - you have all this time that you can
39:22 - spend you know going out and expanding
39:24 - your skills as a developer uh what do
39:27 - you do what what are those first few
39:29 - months like in the UK yeah like to be
39:33 - very honest I was very anxious because
39:36 - from the time we arrived like he had
39:39 - schedules that he knows what he will do
39:42 - there's a set schedule he's going to go
39:44 - to school there are classes he's going
39:46 - to take there is place that he needs to
39:48 - be in like for me I had absolutely
39:51 - nothing and again like because this was
39:54 - I was already in my late 20s I I felt
39:58 - very different from when I was in the
40:00 - early 20s you know I I think I had more
40:04 - fear at the time and more anxiety about
40:07 - like completely different environment in
40:09 - different
40:10 - countries um so I did apply uh for many
40:15 - jobs as a front-end developer because
40:17 - that's I I knew that that's what I
40:18 - wanted to do at the time and I got some
40:22 - interview opportunities but a lot of the
40:24 - companies um wouldn't so easily
40:28 - give like such Junior who don't have any
40:30 - experience as a developer a job you know
40:33 - um so but then Al also like our savings
40:37 - was was kind of like running out quickly
40:40 - um because like no no none of us was
40:42 - working at the time so I just you know
40:44 - applied as a designer because that was
40:46 - much easier I already have experience
40:48 - and I got a job as UI ux
40:52 - designer yeah what what type of work
40:55 - were you doing and like like what kind
40:56 - of industry or what kind of company were
40:59 - you working at yeah it's um it was same
41:03 - like tech industry they had their own
41:05 - soft in-house built software that was
41:07 - using by a lot of you know clients and
41:11 - my job was to design the software that
41:15 - they were building and so basically the
41:18 - same just different product and
41:19 - different company but my day-to-day job
41:22 - was same and this time you know it was a
41:25 - bit different because I could spend a
41:26 - lot of time in More ux Design side
41:30 - rather than UI design so I had a chance
41:33 - to go to the client's site to meet the
41:36 - people so the potential users to do the
41:38 - user interviews and user testings and
41:41 - this kind of thing to iterate to make
41:43 - our product better design better and
41:46 - that was that was a fun thing yeah so
41:48 - this is like great because uh we always
41:52 - say like user testing user testing like
41:54 - uh make sure that you can empathize with
41:56 - your users
41:57 - and like there's an entire category of
42:00 - user experience uh developers and user
42:03 - experience designers that is like
42:04 - basically user testing and uh I guess
42:08 - user research um and and basically
42:11 - empathizing with them so you can
42:12 - understand they sit down they need to
42:14 - get XYZ done you know what are what is
42:18 - going through their mind what do they
42:19 - care about like do they care about the
42:21 - fancy splash screen that you show throw
42:23 - up like saying the best software ever or
42:25 - whatever or do they just like ah get out
42:27 - of my way I need to get this this client
42:29 - work done really quick or or whatever it
42:31 - is right like so so you were able to
42:34 - talk with the actual people that were
42:35 - using the
42:36 - software yeah exactly and who were these
42:39 - people so uh this client I it was an it
42:44 - was an Airbus in in France and they they
42:49 - are like very tacky people as well these
42:52 - are you know not someone who never use
42:54 - computer you know they they use computer
42:56 - they use like very very complicated
42:59 - software all the time but even for these
43:02 - people what's really interesting is
43:05 - that what what we like our team thought
43:08 - this is so natural and this is so easy
43:11 - to do this kind of thing this kind of
43:13 - task is not so easy and it's not so
43:17 - natural to people who never seen this
43:20 - software never seen the design never
43:21 - seen the screen so that's why this kind
43:25 - of user testing actual testing is very
43:27 - very very useful because say you can
43:31 - never guess what people would think you
43:33 - know you can never be right maybe I
43:35 - don't know maybe I shouldn't say never
43:37 - but a lot of the times a lot of the
43:40 - times you're going to find it very
43:41 - different from what you would expect
43:44 - yeah well um what did you learn during
43:47 - that that process work Airbus of course
43:49 - like one of the biggest corporations on
43:51 - Earth making you know one of the two
43:54 - giant you know plane
43:55 - manufacturers um
43:57 - well also that's cool that you you
43:59 - started in France doing fashion design
44:00 - now you're going back to France doing uh
44:03 - essentially uh user experience design
44:07 - right
44:08 - uh what did you learn from that that
44:11 - part of your life oh so like to clar
44:14 - clarify I didn't work for Airbus Airbus
44:18 - was one of the clients yeah they were
44:20 - one of the clients but you you you got
44:21 - to go out to France to work with him to
44:25 - do the user testing yeah yeah and I I
44:26 - mean I make it sound like it's a big
44:28 - deal but like you can just get in like
44:29 - the Chunnel did did you do the Chunnel
44:31 - where you go under the the the canal um
44:34 - to go from London to Paris or the
44:36 - Eurostar the Eurostar yeah no Eurostar
44:40 - goes from London to
44:42 - Paris Airbus was in tulus it's a
44:45 - different city ah so we just took flight
44:48 - from okay did you fly on an Airbus
44:52 - plane I don't know actually yeah
44:57 - that's cool so I want to um we can
45:01 - definitely delve more into uh your your
45:04 - day-to-day work but I've got just like a
45:05 - ton of questions for you that I'm just
45:07 - going to fire off like one of the things
45:10 - that uh and ultimately after you work
45:12 - there like how long have you been at
45:13 - your just to just to finish the
45:15 - autobiographical like Arc how long have
45:17 - you been at your current company octopus
45:20 - energy this coming August because right
45:24 - now is April coming August will be my
45:26 - third year anniversary yeah and this is
45:29 - a really cool company like I hadn't
45:30 - heard of them before uh I met you but
45:33 - they're doing like renewable energy
45:35 - right yes yeah 100% green energy yeah
45:40 - and and what what kind of work do you do
45:42 - for them are you like developing like
45:44 - you know dashboards and user experience
45:47 - for end customers or like what what does
45:49 - it look like yeah so what's really
45:51 - interesting about octopus energy is so
45:55 - octopus energy is more like a grp group
45:57 - so when it says octopus energy it sounds
46:00 - like I'm working for Energy company but
46:02 - it's actually a tech company in the like
46:06 - a subcompany that I belong to is called
46:10 - Kraken Technologies and Kraken
46:13 - Technologies build our in-house software
46:16 - called Kraken which is used by different
46:19 - energy providers around the globe um and
46:23 - we have many different clients here in
46:25 - Europe um and in APAC also yeah Asia
46:30 - Pacific yeah yeah and also in North
46:33 - America um and the work that I do
46:37 - because we have many many different
46:39 - products uh that exist right now I work
46:44 - for a product that's we're basically
46:47 - building like a do you know what cookie
46:49 - cutter is Cookie Cutter like basically
46:52 - you like we some give something to the
46:54 - clients who want to use our Kraken API
46:58 - and when they Rec clone this product in
47:01 - from our repo they can just build the
47:04 - consumer the user facing website out of
47:07 - the box really fast and easily and they
47:10 - can see all of the examples of what you
47:12 - can build using our API that's the
47:15 - project I'm working for at the moment so
47:18 - essentially at the end of the day they
47:20 - have like a white labeled kind of user
47:22 - experience that is really just like them
47:25 - it's it's almost kind of like getting
47:26 - like WordPress you get WordPress and you
47:29 - go in and you customize all the stuff
47:30 - behind the scenes and to your end user
47:33 - wow this is so different and like
47:35 - bespoke looking but you're actually
47:37 - using power tools behind the scene to
47:40 - just very quickly get a lot of stuff
47:41 - done you didn't have to go in and like
47:43 - figure out exactly how you were going to
47:44 - like do absolute positioning in the
47:46 - footer and all this other stuff right
47:48 - like a lot of that stuff was done for
47:50 - you and so it's it's like a power tool
47:52 - for creating maybe some sort of like
47:55 - customer interface that a a user that a
47:57 - utility company might need right yeah
47:59 - yeah okay cool that was that was a great
48:02 - um yeah comparison okay cool I just want
48:04 - to make sure I understand it correctly
48:06 - uh but cookie cutter that's that's a
48:08 - good term because um for anybody who
48:11 - hasn't ever B cookies you get the cookie
48:12 - cutter and you can have them in whatever
48:14 - shape you want and uh it's a lot easier
48:17 - than like using uh you know a knife or
48:20 - something to like shape the cookies
48:21 - yourself so um I'm curious to learn
48:25 - about like now that we know a little bit
48:27 - about your journey what did you use to
48:30 - learn to code because you have a very
48:33 - broad skill set that you've developed
48:34 - mostly just by learning on your own
48:37 - right like uh you you are essentially
48:40 - self-taught even though I like to say
48:42 - when people are self-taught like
48:43 - nobody's truly self-taught unless they
48:45 - independently learn things without
48:46 - reading books and things like that but
48:49 - to use the more I guess generous
48:51 - definition of self-taught you're
48:52 - effectively self-taught
48:54 - right yeah I mean yes and no because
48:58 - when I was working as a UI ux designer
49:01 - in Korea back in Soul I took some
49:04 - classes online classes and free code
49:08 - Camp obviously um like there were so
49:11 - many tools available online um that
49:14 - either free or not very expensive that I
49:17 - can take so that's how how I was
49:20 - learning programming at the time and
49:24 - coming to the UK so I worked worked as a
49:27 - product designer so uiux designer and I
49:30 - left the company because it was more and
49:33 - more clear in my mind that this is not
49:35 - what I want to do I want to do
49:38 - programming so I left the company and
49:41 - then um I joined the coding Booth Camp
49:44 - uh like an intensive course and then I
49:47 - was able to join because they had like a
49:49 - scholarship for people who's coming from
49:51 - um like a minor minority background I
49:56 - say under representative um yeah uh so
50:00 - joined the booth camp and then did the
50:01 - 16 weeks um course uh here in the UK and
50:05 - then after that I got a fullstack
50:08 - developer position yeah Junior uh
50:11 - fullstack Dev in a in a start up yeah
50:14 - yeah so just
50:15 - uh one of the things you've said like in
50:18 - the past uh when when I've talked to you
50:20 - is that you felt like working in design
50:23 - you were really just kind of like doing
50:25 - the same few things over and over like
50:27 - there's only so many ways that like a
50:29 - landing page needs to look or a footer
50:31 - needs to look or like some sort of like
50:33 - navigational window and like you can't
50:36 - get too far from that or else it's not
50:38 - familiar enough and users get frustrated
50:40 - with like where did this go like why is
50:42 - this user experience so confusing so to
50:45 - some extent would you say you were
50:48 - applying a much more limited range of
50:50 - different um Concepts as a designer than
50:53 - you are now doing as a as a developer
50:56 - yeah that's what I learned you know
50:59 - working as a uiux designer is that my
51:02 - work is kind of repetitive and then like
51:05 - I'm not in no way representing the whole
51:08 - like UI uiux designer task because
51:11 - everyone could be very different and
51:13 - depends on what their product is and
51:16 - what their
51:17 - company is but the job that I was
51:20 - working because I was working for
51:21 - startups and then they had either their
51:24 - product or the software they were
51:25 - building my job dayto day was very
51:29 - repetitive and there wasn't much room to
51:31 - be very creative like you said like
51:34 - people are people want something that
51:37 - they're familiar with you know and we
51:39 - have to design something that's easy and
51:41 - that makes sense to people and then when
51:43 - you want to do that like there is not
51:45 - much room for you to be very creative
51:49 - it's very different from like print
51:50 - design or graphic design you have to
51:52 - design something that people that's that
51:54 - makes sense to people you know that
51:56 - already exist so people already know
51:59 - what it is yeah and that's when I felt
52:02 - like oh you know I I feel I feel like
52:05 - I'm just doing same thing over and over
52:07 - again yeah yeah well when you talk about
52:11 - graphic design and print design did you
52:13 - do did you ever do print design and
52:15 - graphic design yeah yeah a little bit
52:18 - when when I was in the states uh before
52:20 - I um learned how to use WordPress I also
52:24 - did the graphic design yeah a lot of lot
52:26 - of people listening to this probably
52:28 - studied graphic design like it's one of
52:29 - the most popular majors in the United
52:31 - States I think maybe it's not one of the
52:33 - most popular but I have tons of friends
52:34 - who study graphic design and it's still
52:36 - like uh a field that a lot of people go
52:38 - into but that's almost kind of like for
52:41 - magazines newspapers and like print uh
52:44 - you know uh printed like annual reports
52:47 - from companies like there's a lot of
52:48 - creativity that goes into those because
52:50 - it's just like a static page and people
52:52 - can just like read and flip the page and
52:54 - stuff but with web design like that's an
52:55 - interesting Point like people need to
52:58 - know how to navigate around it and and
53:00 - as a result it's it's used it's not
53:02 - merely consumed like print is and
53:05 - therefore that really does constrain how
53:08 - creative you can be to an extent right
53:11 - yeah yeah and to be fair like there are
53:14 - many like really really interesting web
53:16 - designs out there like website like
53:18 - Awards you know with like 3ws and you
53:22 - know there there are many many websites
53:25 - that has complet different design but
53:28 - you know with good reasons you know it
53:30 - could be like a you know marketing
53:32 - specific website or for this campaign or
53:35 - there is a reason why this has to be
53:37 - very different but our like a lot of the
53:40 - websites that we see they to day web
53:42 - application or mobile application um
53:46 - they it's not great if they are like two
53:50 - different from rest of Cs because then
53:52 - you know it's confusing to people yeah I
53:54 - mean a lot of people say like free camp
53:56 - your landing page looks kind of bland
53:58 - like uh and I'm like yeah but it's one
54:00 - of the most accessible accessible
54:03 - landing pages around like uh there was a
54:05 - this uh gentleman who does he cares a
54:08 - great deal about accessibility and he
54:11 - goes through and he like ranks
54:13 - accessibility of different charities
54:14 - around the world and uh of the 100 plus
54:17 - Charities that he looked at we were like
54:18 - number three or number four I think uh
54:21 - and that's because we care about
54:23 - accessibility we care about performance
54:25 - we care about you know just having a
54:27 - nice simple landing page that shows
54:30 - people like very like what you see is
54:32 - what you get type uh experience as
54:34 - opposed to being fancy and having a lot
54:36 - of stuff but um but you you could
54:38 - definitely be more creative I'm not
54:39 - saying that freeo camps like landing
54:41 - pages like perfect and solved and
54:44 - everything like that but but that is
54:46 - like there are so many considerations
54:48 - and so we often get people like oh you
54:49 - should Jazz it up you should do like you
54:51 - know carousels I don't know like random
54:54 - things that people tell tell me I should
54:55 - do to The Landing page um but at the end
54:58 - of the day like what's more important
55:00 - form or function well they're both
55:02 - important but at the end of the day like
55:03 - for a website in my humble opinion
55:05 - function is the most important thing and
55:07 - being able to get things done uh there
55:10 - are some amazing like if you look at
55:12 - Gary Simon he uh designc course.com I
55:15 - interviewed him uh and that podcast
55:17 - episode may already be out by the time
55:18 - this comes out if not look for it really
55:22 - inspiring web designer he's got like
55:24 - this artistic guy he's been doing this
55:26 - for like 20 years and he's got amazing
55:28 - designs that are just like I never would
55:30 - have thought of those things but at the
55:31 - same time uh he also asked to consider
55:34 - accessibility he has to consider how is
55:36 - this going to look on a small device
55:39 - right how is this going to load you know
55:41 - all these additional considerations so I
55:44 - can I can definitely see like you
55:46 - wanting to continue to expand your skill
55:48 - set so for graphic designers out there
55:51 - and web designers who want to get more
55:53 - technical who want to become full stack
55:55 - Developers like you are and have the
55:58 - ability to uh you know use tools like
56:01 - react and maybe also use tools like no
56:04 - JS um what would you recommend they do
56:08 - if they wanted to do what you did and
56:10 - transition from like like become even
56:13 - more
56:15 - technical I think even if you are
56:18 - designer and you continue you know you
56:21 - think you're contined to be designer so
56:24 - like you don't have to make a career
56:25 - transition but still like understanding
56:28 - even just a little bit about how your
56:30 - design comes to life how it's built is
56:34 - very Priceless because at the end of the
56:36 - day the people that you work with are
56:39 - Engineers are developers and it's really
56:43 - it makes it so much you know easier for
56:46 - you to communicate with them if you
56:48 - understand what they are talking about
56:50 - and then also like when you design
56:52 - because you understand how things work
56:54 - how things are built um um you maybe
56:57 - will give a second thought when you like
56:59 - want to put this here and then that
57:01 - there you know if you understand how
57:04 - it's built you know you're going to
57:05 - understand the constraints better and
57:07 - what developers would say um it's going
57:10 - to make everything easier for everyone
57:12 - so uh I think it's really good skill to
57:15 - learn even if you're a designer but yeah
57:18 - for for people who actually want to make
57:21 - career transition like myself um and if
57:25 - you are already designer I think that's
57:27 - really great because you are already
57:29 - industry and you probably already you
57:31 - know have a lot of experience working
57:33 - with other engineers and developer and
57:35 - you can kind of see what they do dayto
57:37 - day so maybe you know like ask yourself
57:41 - is this like is what they are doing is
57:43 - something I'm going to enjoy I think
57:45 - that's really important for you know
57:47 - reason why I changed my career from
57:50 - design to development is because I knew
57:54 - that I was enjoying programming more
57:56 - than design work um so it is true that
58:01 - there are a lot of jobs out there there
58:03 - like a lot of companies looking for
58:05 - developers engineers and then like how
58:08 - you can progress over time like the
58:11 - career aspect is great too but don't
58:14 - just change your career because of that
58:16 - just make sure that you are going to
58:19 - like it you you're going to enjoy it
58:21 - that I think that's really really
58:23 - important yeah one thing that you did uh
58:27 - that you posted a lot about back in the
58:29 - day was you did 100 days of code um was
58:33 - was that a helpful tool a helpful
58:35 - Community for you to uh improve your
58:38 - developer skills each day yeah
58:41 - absolutely 100 days of code it's it's
58:43 - been great I um I post it on my Twitter
58:47 - now X every day because it it gives you
58:51 - the motivation to code every day it's
58:55 - kind of a self commitment but also
58:57 - there's a community like if you have
58:59 - that # 100 days of code like this big
59:02 - Community out there will like support
59:04 - you by like commenting and then liking
59:07 - your post and then you do the same for
59:09 - others and then because you are a part
59:11 - of it you know you feel like I I don't
59:13 - want to skip the day I want to do it
59:15 - like want or do 100 days and it is it is
59:18 - a big commitment it's not easy but you
59:21 - know if you are self-learning you know
59:25 - like I once did it's it's really great
59:27 - Community to be
59:29 - in yeah one of the thing that you've
59:32 - told me a little bit about you your work
59:34 - day-to-day at octopus energy which
59:36 - sounds like a fabulous place to work you
59:38 - all are really big on pair programming
59:42 - can you talk about what PA programming
59:44 - is and what a typical PA programming
59:47 - session might look like absolutely so
59:50 - par we do a lot of par programming in my
59:53 - company right now um and Par program in
59:56 - is basically like two developers or more
59:59 - is fine too but usually there's um like
60:02 - one person who's actually coding and
60:04 - then I think there was a they call it
60:07 - Navigator and driver or something like
60:10 - that maybe yeah yeah is it yeah so one
60:13 - person who's actually like typing the
60:15 - code and then one person like watching
60:17 - and this is very helpful because you're
60:21 - going to find yourself a lot of the
60:22 - times that you're kind of stuck and then
60:24 - it seems like you're not made making any
60:26 - progress this happens we are all humans
60:29 - and our brain gets tired and then a lot
60:31 - of the issues that you have now maybe it
60:33 - will be solved next morning after a good
60:35 - night sleep uh par programming you
60:38 - basically you get another fresh set of
60:42 - um eyes and brain they're with you and
60:45 - then you can also you know like rubber
60:47 - ducking um yeah explain rubber ducking
60:50 - yeah and you by you like trying to make
60:55 - this other person
60:56 - understand you can kind of organize your
60:59 - thought that way and then as you're
61:01 - doing that maybe you're going to find
61:03 - solution you know who knows like yeah so
61:06 - rubber ducking it like is where you have
61:08 - like the rubber duck just sitting on
61:10 - your like on top of your monitor or
61:12 - wherever and you're trying to explain
61:14 - things to the rubber duck which is
61:15 - absurd why the rubber duck is an
61:17 - inanimate object it cannot understand
61:19 - what you're saying but just the process
61:21 - of trying to explain what's going on and
61:24 - articulating that out loud
61:26 - can it's almost like the rubber duck is
61:28 - a sounding board and it helps you arrive
61:30 - at your own conclusion oh that's why
61:33 - because I didn't do XYZ right like so um
61:36 - and pair programming is almost like
61:37 - having a rubber duck that can actually
61:38 - talk back and say oh but did you do this
61:41 - oh no I didn't do that that's the answer
61:43 - you know so you get unstuck a lot faster
61:46 - par programming has often been
61:48 - criticized because people are like but
61:50 - two developers working independently
61:52 - could create more code but but creating
61:55 - code is not
61:56 - the goal right the goal is to solve the
61:59 - problem is to is to to implement some
62:02 - sort of solution right just just going
62:04 - in creating a bunch of code you know a
62:06 - whole bunch of chimpanzees can like bash
62:09 - on keyboards all day and they won't
62:11 - necessarily produce something useful but
62:13 - the moment that you have like a more
62:14 - deliberative process you know it can
62:17 - ultimately yield a lot of time even
62:19 - though technically you're using twice as
62:20 - much time because you're using two
62:21 - people's time uh things can get done
62:24 - faster I think my suspicion as to why
62:27 - people don't like pair programming is
62:28 - because a lot of people just are more
62:30 - introverted and don't want to like and
62:33 - also it's embarrassing sometimes like
62:34 - somebody's watching as you code and like
62:36 - you make some embarrassing remark you're
62:38 - just like oh no I look like a fool in
62:40 - front of my my esteemed colleague uh so
62:44 - it's one of those things where you have
62:45 - to be kind of Brave to be able to pair
62:47 - program what what was it like had you
62:50 - ever pair program before this like did
62:52 - you do this um online before you joined
62:55 - octopus inter
62:57 - I did in my previous company so my first
62:59 - job um as a as a junior fullstack
63:02 - developer um yeah what was it like the
63:04 - first time you pair programed what did
63:07 - it feel awkward I was I was very because
63:10 - I also did the coding Booth camp and we
63:12 - did a lot of PA programming there so it
63:15 - was something that's just very natural
63:17 - to me cuz it's I mean if you are focused
63:22 - this is what I like about programming by
63:23 - the way you are focused to solve this
63:25 - problem
63:26 - you know it's not about someone judge
63:28 - you how smart you are or judge Your
63:31 - solution if it's good or bad like you
63:33 - and the other developers like all of our
63:36 - goal is the same to solve this problem
63:39 - and you know like if we talk together
63:43 - there is a better chance that we will
63:45 - get better solution you know that's what
63:48 - it is and in my first job I was very
63:51 - lucky that the uh CTO there it was a
63:55 - small startup and there weren't that
63:56 - many people the CTO who hired me he was
64:00 - very very committed to Mentor me at the
64:02 - time so every time I face an issue or
64:04 - have a question like he would be there
64:07 - like sitting next to me on my desk to
64:09 - like for me to like talk to him and then
64:12 - like explain what the problem is and
64:14 - then kind of you know guide me how I can
64:16 - solve this issues so yeah I've already
64:19 - done a lot of par programming and very
64:22 - used to the concept and how it works and
64:24 - things like that and I think I think I
64:26 - think you made a very good point like
64:28 - some people don't feel comfortable about
64:30 - PA programming I think what's also
64:32 - important is the culture and the
64:35 - environment that you're in are you in
64:37 - the environment where they encourage you
64:39 - to par program because my current
64:42 - company does you know and maybe if you
64:45 - are in an environment where like nobody
64:47 - wants to pair program or they like your
64:50 - employer might think that this is a
64:51 - waste of time why two people looking at
64:53 - one monitor you know if you're in that
64:55 - kind of environment then naturally
64:57 - you're not going to feel so comfortable
65:00 - about PA programming right yeah but but
65:03 - if it's it's kind of like culture comes
65:05 - from the Top If the CTO or the head of
65:09 - engineering if they value pair
65:10 - programming they believe in it that's
65:12 - going to propagate down and people are
65:14 - going to par program more and they're
65:15 - going to feel comfortable par
65:16 - programming without being judged like oh
65:18 - I'm you know I'm wasting company Time by
65:21 - doing this when I should just be fixing
65:23 - it myself you know so yeah I I and
65:27 - that's that's really cool that you
65:28 - because you joined a small startup where
65:30 - the CTO could have the bandwidth to have
65:33 - a personal relationship with you and
65:35 - actually Mentor you to an extent like
65:37 - that's yet another endorsement for
65:39 - working at small companies rather than
65:41 - going straight out of school and and
65:43 - going or or going straight out of
65:45 - another company if you're transitioning
65:47 - into Tech uh trying to work at small
65:50 - companies I again I uh as I've written
65:53 - about in my book how to learn the code
65:55 - and get a developer job freely available
65:57 - if you just Google learn a code book it
65:59 - should be the top res hopefully click on
66:02 - it and read it h it's it's free and I
66:04 - talk a lot about my own personal Journey
66:06 - which was basically working at a small
66:09 - local startup and uh talking to the CTO
66:12 - directly I interviewed directly with the
66:14 - CTO and the head of engineering and like
66:16 - it was only like it was a very small
66:17 - team but I as a result I got all kinds
66:19 - of personal kind of like mentorship that
66:22 - I wouldn't have gotten if IID just gone
66:24 - straight to a big company where I was
66:26 - software engineer one and then there
66:28 - were like software engineer 2 software
66:30 - engineer 3 and like you know um staff
66:33 - engineer like the giant hierarchy of of
66:36 - titles right like and you can absolutely
66:38 - go to those places first but I strongly
66:40 - encourage people to try to join small
66:41 - companies first and it sounds like you
66:43 - got to wear a lot of hats too you were
66:45 - probably doing all kinds of different
66:46 - work and working in all the different
66:47 - kinds parts of the code base as a result
66:50 - um I want to talk to you a little bit
66:52 - about tools uh so you um
66:56 - you work with d Jango which is a python
67:01 - uh backend development framework a
67:03 - little bit right and and because that's
67:05 - that's my understanding is that octopus
67:07 - energy uses Jango instead of just using
67:09 - like no. JS right uh Kraken does our
67:13 - soft but the project that I'm working
67:16 - for right now doesn't use Jango what I
67:18 - use day-to-day is react typescript and
67:22 - nextjs okay nextjs yeah very powerful
67:25 - library that we have some excellent
67:27 - nextjs courses on the free cocap YouTube
67:29 - channel by the way sorry if I'm like
67:30 - chilling for free C too much it's like
67:32 - my literally my job I'm wearing a free
67:34 - shirt right but I I I I I want to remind
67:38 - people that we have these resources um
67:40 - and some of which are being translated
67:41 - into Korean thanks to you um we'll get
67:44 - to that in a moment but uh so you're
67:47 - primarily working with like full stack
67:49 - JavaScript but in the past you've worked
67:51 - with PHP right that was my first job
67:54 - yeah how you compare the PHP like
67:56 - developer ecosystems because there's
67:58 - like laravel there so many different
68:00 - types of Frameworks and stuff how would
68:02 - you compare that to working with
68:04 - fullstack
68:05 - JavaScript
68:07 - um to be honest like it's years back and
68:10 - I don't have much memory working in PHP
68:13 - we use LEL at the time LEL and react
68:17 - frontend right now in octopus energy I
68:19 - don't do full stack I I'm primarily
68:23 - frontend engineer I do have a do the
68:26 - backend mentorship I have a backend
68:28 - Mentor who can like teach me the python
68:30 - and stuff but uh only when I have I can
68:34 - do it when I have spare time to put some
68:37 - time in the backend tickets but my
68:40 - day-to-day work is primarily front end
68:43 - and to compare um to compare frontend to
68:47 - PHP is that your question yeah just in
68:49 - general like like um working with these
68:52 - different tools that you've worked with
68:53 - over the years like how is working with
68:55 - PHP different from working with like
68:57 - nextjs for
69:02 - example solving problem that's always
69:05 - the thing whichever language whichever
69:08 - tool that you use you know that's what
69:10 - you do as a programmer like it doesn't
69:11 - matter so much about what language which
69:14 - language you use which platform are you
69:17 - like mobile developer are you web
69:18 - developer it doesn't matter too much you
69:20 - are solving problems so that's the same
69:23 - just that it's a language right
69:25 - so if you think about different
69:27 - languages English Korean or Spanish like
69:30 - you know you learn the language there
69:32 - different vocabularies there there are
69:34 - different grammars and things like that
69:36 - same for same goes to programming
69:37 - languages you have to learn the language
69:39 - you have to learn how the language works
69:42 - you know um so basically it's a
69:46 - different tool to do the same job if
69:49 - that makes sense yeah yeah absolutely so
69:52 - so it's just an implementation detail
69:54 - essentially you're so if somebody worked
69:57 - in PHP uh like let's say they were doing
70:00 - like WordPress development and they were
70:01 - using PHP or or they had a larl project
70:03 - or if they were doing something
70:04 - completely different like they were they
70:05 - were doing a Ruby on Rails project in
70:07 - your view it's mostly just about like
70:10 - okay these tools do comparable things at
70:12 - the end of the day the work is more
70:14 - defined by what you need to get done
70:16 - than it is how you get it done exactly
70:20 - okay cool yeah I mean that's how a lot
70:22 - of the guests on the show feel I just
70:24 - figured I'd ask you too because because
70:25 - you've got like a pretty broad you
70:27 - you've gotten a lot of experience uh in
70:29 - in your relatively short time as a
70:31 - developer uh compared to a lot like I
70:32 - have people on that like have been doing
70:34 - software development like 20 25 years
70:36 - right I like to get perspective uh from
70:39 - uh from people who are relatively new to
70:41 - the field as well um and one of the
70:44 - things that like really uh intrigued me
70:47 - is that um you have talked a little bit
70:51 - about um you know impostor syndrome in
70:54 - the past
70:56 - and how uh for example at a lot of the
70:58 - teams that you've been a part on there
71:00 - haven't been that many women uh can you
71:02 - talk about like how you I guess were
71:06 - able to accomplish things despite the
71:08 - fact that you know there may not be a
71:10 - lot of women in the team and and you
71:11 - might have felt some imposter
71:13 - syndrome yeah um so I mean it is a known
71:16 - fact that you know there are less female
71:19 - than males in tech industry overall but
71:22 - the impos Imposter syndrome that I
71:24 - experien
71:26 - isn't necessarily coming from like me
71:29 - being female and you know a minority
71:31 - yeah it's just and I I think I had it a
71:35 - lot more frequently when I was more
71:38 - Junior I just felt like I'm not
71:40 - qualified or I'm not smart enough and
71:44 - you know I don't I don't know if I can
71:46 - be here I don't know if I can do this
71:48 - like these self-doubt full questions
71:51 - right and this still happens Quincy like
71:54 - I was I was talking a few weeks back and
71:56 - I I I brought it out like I don't know
71:58 - you know if I can be in this podcast but
72:01 - um yeah it happens and I'm sure like
72:04 - other software Engineers out there who's
72:07 - watching this I'm sure you can relate to
72:09 - this I know that I'm not the only one
72:11 - who feels this it Happ like the problems
72:14 - that we have to solve you know it will
72:17 - be great if there are only easy problems
72:19 - that we can just fix right away and then
72:21 - just get pushed you're dropped on but
72:23 - that's not the reality some problems are
72:25 - hard it's more difficult and sometimes
72:28 - you might spend a whole week or more
72:32 - than a week to try to solve this one
72:34 - problem that you cannot solve it happens
72:38 - you know
72:39 - naturally you feel doubtful about your
72:42 - ability you know your intelligence and
72:46 - and that's that's why pa programming is
72:48 - important like don't get stuck in your
72:50 - box alone like bring another person or
72:53 - two to talk you know discuss because if
72:56 - this problem is difficult for you
72:59 - there's a chance that it's difficult
73:00 - problem for other people and it's better
73:03 - when you have more brains
73:05 - together yeah like what advice would you
73:08 - send back to yourself I mean I I commend
73:11 - you for coming on the free cocam podcast
73:12 - this is your second podcast ever right
73:15 - like um and uh I was so impressed with
73:18 - your performance on like the previous
73:20 - podcast I had which I'll link to if
73:21 - people want to listen to uh some more
73:23 - interview with you Alison but
73:26 - um I mean
73:28 - that I I feel really glad that you came
73:32 - on because I think people should hear
73:33 - from you because you're like a really
73:34 - cool interesting person has this
73:36 - interesting background and I'm just
73:38 - excited to share that with our audience
73:40 - um what advice though would you send
73:43 - back to somebody who's feeling imposter
73:45 - syndrome trying to get into Tech uh who
73:48 - who may not be a native English speaker
73:50 - right uh or who may not have ever worked
73:54 - in the UK before for like you're you're
73:56 - like having the the
73:58 - multi-pronged effect of like you're
73:59 - relatively early in your career and you
74:02 - transitioned into gradually more
74:03 - technical roles from you know fashion
74:06 - design and graphic design to software
74:09 - like to kind of like uiux designed to
74:13 - front end development right and and even
74:15 - doing some backend development so so
74:17 - doing gradually learning the full sack
74:20 - like what advice would you have for
74:23 - somebody who is also
74:25 - taking on such ambitious undertakings as
74:28 - you have taken
74:30 - on that's a great question um you know
74:34 - when I was learning programming using
74:38 - free code camp or taking online courses
74:40 - like I I
74:42 - just I try to find in every way how I
74:45 - can learn programming because I really
74:47 - wanted to do but then like in the back
74:50 - of my mind I had this doubt that but I'm
74:53 - not even good at math can I do
74:55 - programming you know I always had this
74:57 - question like am I do I have programming
75:00 - brain no cuz I I know that I don't have
75:03 - math brain like to be very honest with
75:06 - you I my math I was really bad at math
75:09 - in school like that's the only thing I
75:12 - was studying then it was still the worst
75:14 - thing you know uh I was at so yeah I I
75:18 - wasn't sure it was fun for me but then I
75:21 - wasn't sure if I could do it but then I
75:24 - kind of shifted my perspective from like
75:28 - you know what I'm not good at math but
75:30 - I'm good at language and maybe
75:33 - programming I can consider like language
75:35 - is computer's language and I'm learning
75:37 - computer's language so maybe put aside
75:40 - that math fear uh and then just learn it
75:43 - like I would do about language and then
75:46 - let's do it that way and that's how I
75:48 - you know uh decided to think and I'm
75:54 - sure that there are a lot of people out
75:55 - there who ask this question to
75:58 - themselves like I did you know coming
76:00 - from completely unrelated backgrounds or
76:04 - you know you are already working in very
76:06 - different industry or you feel like you
76:08 - don't have qualification because you
76:11 - don't have computer science degree um if
76:14 - you know that you
76:16 - enjoy programming like I mean go to free
76:19 - code Camp there are so there are so many
76:22 - great resources available and courses
76:24 - that you can do in your own time you
76:27 - know and it's completely free um try it
76:31 - see if you like it and if you like it if
76:34 - you enjoy it I would say there are it's
76:37 - like 99% that you can make it that's
76:40 - that's what I can say okay so if you
76:43 - enjoy it you can make it yeah awesome
76:47 - that like so inspiring I think for a lot
76:50 - of people to hear who enjoy programming
76:51 - but they're like wait a second like I'm
76:53 - having fun here but am I good enough to
76:55 - do it if you enjoy it you're going to
76:57 - keep doing it and eventually with enough
76:59 - practice you're going to be good enough
77:00 - right practice makes perfect that that
77:02 - is my you know you hear that a million
77:04 - times a day probably from people but I
77:06 - genuinely believe it's true my son is
77:09 - getting quite good at piano just by
77:10 - practicing every single day like he goes
77:13 - in there and he practices and uh you
77:15 - know it's just like 20 30 minutes a day
77:17 - but it it is gradually accumulating and
77:20 - he's getting better at it right and my
77:22 - daughter's doing the same thing like the
77:23 - Chinese they're getting better Chinese
77:25 - because they practice Chinese a whole
77:26 - lot they they watch Magic School Bus in
77:29 - in Chinese and stuff like that you
77:31 - yourself have just done you know more
77:33 - than an hour worth of interviewing with
77:35 - a native English speaker in English
77:37 - which is a language that is you know
77:40 - probably in University your classes were
77:42 - in Korean right like uh like you grew up
77:45 - up until your 20s primarily using Korean
77:48 - all day probably right and yet here you
77:50 - are talking at Great length in English
77:52 - like what tips would you have for people
77:55 - who want to improve their
78:00 - English this okay this is more difficult
78:03 - question
78:05 - because
78:07 - um I I started learning English since I
78:10 - was very young um about like first grade
78:14 - in elementary and that's because I liked
78:17 - it I I like I had this interest in
78:21 - learning other langu I like to like
78:22 - listen to you know like when I was young
78:25 - there was a cassette tape you know like
78:28 - before City and there was a cassette I I
78:31 - like to like listen to this English you
78:34 - know cassette tape like from like
78:35 - English fairy tales and children's book
78:38 - that was written in English even if I
78:41 - didn't understand anything I just like
78:42 - the sound of it and that's something
78:46 - yeah I
78:47 - guess something I was born I am in I
78:50 - even to this state you know I like to
78:54 - learn
78:55 - different
78:56 - languages um so because I had the
79:00 - interest I was like um it was easier for
79:04 - me cuz it didn't it was never stressful
79:07 - for me to learn and study and then try
79:10 - to kind of repeat after what native
79:13 - speaker would say it was always it
79:17 - wasn't it was never like study study it
79:21 - was more like oh it's fun like I I want
79:22 - to speak like you I want to understand
79:24 - what you're saying um so but I know that
79:28 - not everyone feels this way yeah I I
79:31 - think
79:34 - um was there like a like a big unlock
79:37 - like something you discovered like wow
79:39 - this is makes all the difference like I
79:40 - I I'm learning so much more effectively
79:42 - were there any Revelations like that
79:45 - yeah I think I think a great way to
79:48 - study English is because at the end of
79:51 - the
79:51 - day by learning English what do you want
79:54 - to achieve maybe you have to take
79:56 - English test maybe you have to you know
79:58 - I don't know maybe for a school test
80:00 - maybe to get like take tofl or I El like
80:03 - this kind of English test but learning
80:06 - English you have to know that you are
80:07 - learning it so that you can communicate
80:10 - with others so I think what's important
80:14 - is for you to understand and then can
80:18 - speak what you want to speak so I found
80:22 - it very helpful just by watching fun
80:27 - movies or dramas that are in English and
80:30 - you can't turn on the subtitle that's in
80:34 - English as well maybe you're not going
80:37 - to understand everything but there maybe
80:40 - one word that you understand maybe one
80:43 - full sentence that you understand you
80:46 - know when you have something like that
80:49 - just speak it just you know speak it
80:51 - over and over again until you're tongue
80:55 - remembers you can just it just comes out
80:57 - naturally when when you do with that
80:59 - with one sentence try another sentence
81:02 - try another expression you know uh and
81:05 - even try like how the actor is saying it
81:09 - like their intonation their gestures and
81:11 - everything um just do it over and just
81:14 - repeat until it feels natural to you I I
81:18 - I found that very helpful for me
81:21 - yeah awesome so watching English dramas
81:25 - with English subtitles uh and just doing
81:28 - your best to try to grab as much as you
81:30 - can and understand as much as you can
81:32 - that's like I do the same thing with
81:34 - like with Chinese uh for example like I
81:37 - always watch with the Chinese character
81:39 - subtitles uh and it's a lot easier to
81:41 - understand if you have that kind of like
81:43 - visual reference in addition to the
81:45 - auditory um so yeah that that's great
81:48 - advice um let's talk about the Korean
81:50 - localization
81:52 - effort who all is involved in
81:56 - translating some of these um articles
81:59 - that we' published on our publication
82:00 - into Korea Korean and you know what does
82:04 - that process look like yeah we have a
82:08 - team of volunteers who um there is a
82:12 - form that you can fill it if you want to
82:14 - contribute to to this localization
82:17 - effort um we have team of contributors
82:20 - uh who are volunteers who would spend
82:22 - their free time you know really really
82:25 - thankful to them um who would translate
82:27 - the articles in Korean and the book that
82:30 - you just mentioned Quincy your book
82:32 - that's also available in Korean thanks
82:34 - to all of our contributors who
82:35 - translated you know together the entire
82:38 - book and right now we are translating
82:41 - The Core Curriculum in free code Camp um
82:45 - so yes soon you're going to see Korean
82:48 - in the free Cod Camp main page and some
82:50 - of the curriculums are going to be
82:52 - available in Korean but yeah it's 100%
82:57 - volunteering yeah awesome well anybody
82:59 - who's interested in helping out if if
83:02 - you are a Korean speaker and you want to
83:04 - get involved in the localization effort
83:06 - reach out to Allison uh I'm going to
83:09 - include links if that's cool with you
83:10 - like uh to your Twitter um and a few
83:13 - other things in the show notes below uh
83:16 - I also want to say that like it's not
83:18 - just Korean that we're doing this for
83:19 - we're doing this for Spanish Japanese
83:22 - Swahili Ukrainian
83:24 - uh Portuguese a lot of Major World
83:27 - languages uh we have a big volunteer
83:31 - translation effort underway to make
83:34 - these learning resources even more
83:36 - accessible and yes we could just throw
83:37 - everything into Google translate and
83:39 - have like a mediocre translation but
83:42 - having native speakers who understand
83:43 - the culture who understand the language
83:45 - who understand a little bit about the
83:47 - subject matter of learning to code maybe
83:50 - they're using free code Camp as well
83:51 - like that makes a huge difference to
83:53 - have an actual developer like Allison
83:55 - translating it instead of just having
83:58 - somebody who doesn't have the domain
83:59 - expertise so uh it's a lot slower it's a
84:02 - lot more labor intensive but our hope is
84:04 - that this makes it way easier for people
84:07 - to learn programming because they can
84:08 - learn it in their own native language
84:10 - yes I believe that everybody should
84:11 - learn English if they can it's kind of
84:14 - like the the lingua franka of of tech uh
84:18 - of uh science and to an extent of
84:21 - business but at the same time it's an
84:24 - added layer of difficulty when people
84:25 - want to learn things if they have to
84:27 - like learn in their non-native
84:31 - language we're all about making
84:33 - technology education more accessible and
84:35 - one of the ways we can do that is to
84:37 - make it available in people's native
84:39 - language and uh so I I definitely want
84:41 - to applaud you Allison for all your work
84:44 - toward that and to all of our
84:46 - contributors yes thanks to all the many
84:49 - contributors uh I'm hoping to meet some
84:52 - of you in person in Korea uh I'll be in
84:54 - Korea in summer you and I can hang out
84:57 - again and uh potentially Chris another
85:00 - free Camp staff uh Chris kuishi gawa
85:03 - based in deu he's lived in in Korea for
85:06 - like the past seven years even though
85:07 - he's an American National um yeah we're
85:10 - going to get together and hopefully have
85:11 - a nice uh traditional Korean meal uh and
85:15 - just chill um and yeah we're like really
85:18 - excited about the future of helping more
85:21 - people in Korea get into Tech and we're
85:23 - really excited about helping people in
85:26 - all different places uh not only learn
85:30 - programming But ultimately potentially
85:31 - create technology companies in their
85:34 - countries because Tech is so California
85:37 - Focus like almost all the big tech
85:39 - companies are based in like California
85:40 - or to an extent like Texas and in like
85:43 - Seattle area but there are smart
85:46 - developers everywhere and they just need
85:49 - an opportunity and I I think it's really
85:51 - cool that you and your husband were able
85:52 - to move to the UK that you're working at
85:54 - this really cool place doing meaningful
85:56 - work doing interesting work and I want
86:00 - other people to be able to realize their
86:01 - dreams of doing that as well so we will
86:04 - not rest until everybody who wants to
86:06 - work in Tech is able to work in Tech
86:07 - we're going to keep working hard toward
86:09 - this ideal and I really want to thank
86:11 - you again for your time Alison and
86:13 - everything you're doing thank you so
86:15 - much for having me it was really great
86:16 - to talking to you yeah well until next
86:19 - week everybody happy coding happy coding
