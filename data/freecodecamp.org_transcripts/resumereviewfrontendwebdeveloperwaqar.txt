00:00 - hey guys benjamin's back here again
00:03 - doing another resume review this time
00:05 - we're taking a look at wakara mohammed's
00:08 - resume and
00:10 - i'm also going to do a portfolio review
00:13 - that someone else had provided
00:15 - but i'm going to put that in a separate
00:16 - video and probably put that on my own
00:18 - channel i'm going to reserve the resume
00:20 - reviews
00:21 - directly for
00:22 - my channel and for re-syndication on
00:25 - free code camp
00:26 - okay so i have this basic intake form
00:31 - set up
00:32 - you guys can find the link to this in
00:33 - the description as well and basically i
00:36 - just have a little disclaimer saying hey
00:38 - make sure you're removing phone numbers
00:40 - uh your address email address from your
00:42 - resume unless you're comfortable with
00:43 - the email address being
00:45 - included and required did that so that's
00:48 - great you know he does have his email
00:49 - address and he's comfortable sharing
00:51 - that
00:52 - uh let's see and then he also wanted to
00:54 - share his twitter profile github
00:56 - what he's interested in and which
00:58 - industry is interested in okay didn't
01:00 - fill out an industry but that's fine uh
01:02 - let's see wants to be a junior web
01:04 - developer
01:05 - and okay we have his
01:08 - social media profile here for twitter so
01:11 - i'm just going to go ahead and
01:13 - open all these up we also got github
01:17 - so we're going to do a resume review
01:20 - going to take a quick look at his
01:22 - portfolio site but not really focus on
01:24 - it
01:25 - because that's not the the focus of this
01:27 - video and then that's just a link to our
01:29 - resume
01:31 - cool just going to take a look i do like
01:33 - that the the contact info is up here i
01:36 - dig the layout nice thick
01:39 - horizontal lines uh same thing with the
01:42 - text used
01:44 - and great contrast of text colors as
01:47 - well
01:48 - you know definitely with the orange
01:49 - getting all of the
01:50 - pertinent details popping out
01:53 - and
01:54 - different font faces love that great
01:56 - design
01:58 - overall really dig the layout
02:01 - uh let's see
02:03 - yeah so overall i love the layout let's
02:05 - let's just go from the top so let's see
02:07 - as a highly motivated and result
02:09 - oriented manager within the tech field i
02:12 - have a proven track record of providing
02:14 - exemplary levels of service along with
02:17 - high quality technical
02:19 - and digital content strategy yeah i
02:22 - think that that's a solid intro one
02:24 - thing i think i would
02:27 - maybe focus on a little bit more is
02:30 - highlighting
02:32 - some examples of high technical quality
02:34 - um
02:36 - you know you mention a proven track
02:38 - record so
02:40 - perhaps put in some metrics there but
02:42 - i'll continue reviewing
02:44 - uh the resume and then we'll get back to
02:46 - that
02:47 - same thing let's see digital content
02:48 - strategy i would recommend maybe some
02:51 - digital content projects that you've
02:53 - worked on
02:54 - listing those
02:55 - or perhaps listing different types of
03:00 - let's say digital marketing like search
03:01 - engine optimization for example or
03:04 - conversion rate optimization or
03:07 - analytics
03:08 - something a little bit more specific to
03:10 - include concrete details
03:13 - again i think a lot of people may
03:15 - disagree with me on this but
03:17 - i definitely think that you should have
03:19 - longer than just a one pager
03:21 - i think you should have and this is just
03:23 - personal opinion have your
03:25 - relevant skills kind of near the top
03:27 - relevant projects near the top
03:29 - especially if you're a junior dev uh you
03:32 - don't really want to be leading in with
03:34 - experience that doesn't necessarily tie
03:36 - into
03:37 - the web development job that you're
03:38 - seeking
03:39 - ideally i would
03:41 - you know like in this publish article
03:43 - section have a few of your github
03:45 - repositories or projects and have those
03:48 - kind of near the top
03:49 - maybe under the overview in between
03:51 - experience
03:54 - yeah probably in between experience and
03:56 - then maybe moved articles up a little
03:57 - bit because honestly in my experience
04:00 - a lot of
04:01 - uh recruiters that i've worked with
04:04 - and hiring managers haven't really ever
04:06 - asked about my education or skills the
04:09 - only exception to that is
04:11 - they'll just say hey do you have a
04:12 - four-year degree but they never ask
04:14 - where's the four-year-degree degree from
04:16 - they never ask what's your gpa
04:19 - so one thing to keep in mind there
04:21 - i would recommend putting your education
04:24 - and skills near the bottom and
04:25 - highlighting your projects because
04:27 - essentially you want to be saying to the
04:29 - hiring manager
04:31 - look this is the work that i've done
04:33 - i can complete projects and here are the
04:37 - um
04:39 - the projects that i've completed so
04:40 - definitely you know check them out and
04:44 - you know showcase your work that way
04:46 - anyway i feel like i've kind of covered
04:47 - that quite a bit
04:49 - uh so let's see we have signature design
04:51 - consultants ltd uh company director
04:56 - okay providing
04:57 - consultancy and technical support to sme
05:01 - i'm not sure what that means
05:03 - on
05:04 - digital and web strategy for web and
05:07 - mobile applications and digital
05:08 - marketing
05:10 - um okay well out of curiosity this isn't
05:13 - something a hiring manager or anyone
05:14 - like that is probably going to do again
05:16 - i mentioned they only
05:19 - review a resume for probably about i
05:21 - would say 30 seconds or so if you're
05:23 - lucky
05:24 - um okay so this probably stands for
05:27 - small and medium-sized enterprises or
05:29 - small and medium-sized businesses
05:31 - cool cool got that instead of putting
05:34 - sme i would recommend
05:35 - maybe listing a couple of clients
05:37 - they're proud of working with you know a
05:38 - couple maybe say two medium-sized
05:41 - businesses and one small size business
05:43 - you know i just use that general rule of
05:46 - three to really market to um
05:50 - you know people's mindset and kind of
05:51 - short term memory uh so that those few
05:54 - clients that you've worked with stick in
05:56 - their memory i would also elaborate on
05:57 - consultancy and technical support like
06:00 - what sort of projects did you consult on
06:02 - uh what kind of technical support did
06:05 - you provide and i know you mentioned web
06:07 - and mobile applications and digital
06:09 - strategy but i would recommend
06:11 - mentioning one some of the clients that
06:13 - you worked with as i mentioned and two
06:16 - some of the projects that you worked on
06:17 - for those clients so again you're just
06:20 - really highlighting the projects and
06:21 - work that you've done like i said i
06:23 - really do like the layout i really do
06:25 - like the use of fonts and i really do
06:26 - like the
06:28 - color contrast that i've used okay and
06:30 - then total airport marketing consultant
06:32 - you know make it make it past tense and
06:34 - kind of uh break this up because this is
06:36 - just kind of one
06:38 - like run-on sentence
06:39 - you could either break it out into
06:42 - a couple different ways to display it
06:43 - you could break it down into say bullet
06:44 - points like say there's a bullet point
06:46 - and then you know that next part is a
06:48 - bullet point for training and then the
06:50 - other one is you know the amount of
06:52 - sales that you did then boom you got
06:54 - three solid bullet points you're using
06:56 - the rule at three and uh then you're
06:58 - also providing your facts and figures
07:00 - it's easy to read and it's in past tense
07:03 - um so yeah overall i think good content
07:06 - in there can be rewarded a little bit
07:08 - and instead of doing these uh kind of
07:11 - like run-on sentences where you're
07:12 - trying to smush everything together
07:14 - just break them out into bullet points
07:16 - it'll be easier for people to skim uh
07:18 - let's see
07:20 - stansberry supermarkets department
07:22 - manager okay cool so i imagine here
07:26 - you're trying to highlight some of your
07:27 - managerial experience i'm looking at it
07:29 - now this is october 2013 was the end
07:31 - point and it we're already in november
07:34 - of 18. typically i wouldn't uh list
07:37 - anything
07:38 - later than you know five years ago in
07:40 - the past
07:42 - so honestly i would recommend just
07:44 - removing this uh adding a little bit
07:47 - more
07:48 - allowing it to free up a little bit more
07:49 - space and then as i mentioned earlier uh
07:51 - providing some of those projects that
07:53 - you've worked on and listing that there
07:55 - you know as you as you can notice you
07:58 - can probably spot a trend here i'm
08:00 - just trying to highlight projects
08:02 - projects projects skim ability okay cool
08:04 - and then you have some of your skills
08:06 - web related skills
08:08 - now i understand probably why you kept
08:10 - it this way you wanted to make it
08:12 - clean and skimmable yeah honestly i
08:14 - would recommend adding in more skills
08:17 - here strike that balance between keyword
08:19 - stuffing now if you're not familiar with
08:21 - the phrase keyword stuffing is basically
08:24 - just that taking these keywords or these
08:26 - phrases and putting in things that are
08:28 - relevant to
08:29 - the audience that you want to get in
08:30 - front of and then just kind of peppering
08:33 - a bunch of those in putting putting a
08:34 - bunch of those in
08:37 - so i would recommend writing down some
08:39 - other technologies that you've worked
08:40 - with like css great but maybe put css
08:44 - and then css3
08:46 - if you've worked with sas i would also
08:48 - put in sas you know a css preprocessor
08:52 - if you worked with html i would also put
08:54 - in html5
08:56 - uh also anything that goes along with
08:58 - laravel
08:59 - since that is a php framework i would
09:01 - recommend putting in php
09:04 - uh putting in any package managers that
09:06 - go with that i believe that's symphony
09:08 - if i'm not mistaken
09:10 - uh same thing with javascript if you've
09:12 - messed a little bit with uh node you
09:15 - messed a little bit with react go ahead
09:16 - and list those you want to be
09:18 - transparent and you don't want to lie
09:19 - about the amount of experience that you
09:21 - have with a particular technology you
09:23 - also though want to make sure that
09:25 - you're giving yourself a running start
09:28 - you're making sure that you're giving
09:29 - yourself a decent chance of getting in
09:31 - front of the right people listing every
09:33 - technology especially when you're
09:35 - starting out listing every technology
09:37 - that you've touched it's marketing cool
09:40 - and this is where you highlight on ppc
09:42 - seo sem and digital content okay so
09:45 - that's what you alluded to up here
09:47 - um
09:48 - yeah so let's let's go back to the the
09:50 - overall uh overview here so as i
09:53 - mentioned you may want to put in uh pick
09:56 - one or two of these that you feel that
09:58 - you're the strongest with
09:59 - and pepper those in and kind of put
10:02 - those about your
10:03 - your overview i feel like we we've
10:05 - covered the the resume pretty
10:07 - pretty well i'm just going to go ahead
10:08 - and pull up these articles yeah this is
10:11 - good i mean it does show your kind of
10:13 - political slant
10:15 - as it mentions down here
10:17 - business models politics also shows your
10:19 - interest in entrepreneurship and
10:22 - kind of by proxy your interest in
10:24 - the entertainment sector which is
10:26 - fantastic i think though as i mentioned
10:28 - i would probably save this
10:30 - for your cover letter because on your
10:33 - cover letter that's where you really
10:34 - want to showcase your personality and
10:37 - other aspects of what make you up as an
10:40 - individual whereas the resume is more so
10:42 - just kind of the down and dirty uh
10:45 - here's what i can do here's what i have
10:47 - done
10:48 - um
10:49 - you know that sort of thing your
10:50 - experience your skills your projects
10:53 - like a few
10:54 - uh different articles that
10:57 - i think kind of show your personality in
10:59 - general so i would say one about kind of
11:02 - startup culture one about
11:04 - um social media and then one about say
11:07 - security
11:09 - uh then that will kind of give a decent
11:12 - holistic view of the things you're
11:14 - interested in and with those you just
11:16 - pick the best ones and present those at
11:18 - the top of your cover letter but
11:20 - since you have two profiles you have
11:22 - this one here this one's political
11:24 - politics religion i would
11:26 - just avoid that in general
11:28 - and go with this you know this looks
11:30 - like a
11:33 - solid you know code related profile
11:35 - you know you're saying you're a lawyer
11:36 - previously and
11:38 - now you're focused on software
11:40 - engineering you like javascript and
11:41 - laravel
11:42 - perfect this is what hiring managers
11:44 - really like to see and you can even
11:46 - include this in your cover letter and
11:48 - you can elaborate on that a little bit
11:49 - with a couple more sentences if you want
11:51 - because people people love that they
11:53 - know that lawyers are
11:55 - diligent they know that you have to be
11:57 - focused you have to study hard
12:00 - i'm not sure if you had to pass some
12:01 - sort of a bar exam or some sort of a
12:04 - you know like entry level exam
12:06 - but that's also another thing you can
12:08 - kind of put out there there's usually a
12:10 - good
12:11 - connotation associated with lawyers
12:14 - this is good you have a sense of humor
12:17 - if i were a hiring manager i'd want to
12:18 - see that i think you had shared this
12:20 - with me today
12:22 - this is you on dev2
12:26 - and you're basically talking about the
12:29 - frustration between learning a i think
12:31 - was a solid language and learning a
12:33 - framework and you also have decent
12:36 - engagement here
12:38 - with uh some of the commenters which is
12:41 - fantastic
12:43 - this would be an article honestly that i
12:45 - would
12:46 - also put on your on your cover letter
12:48 - the hr professional isn't going to
12:50 - probably look at that the hiring manager
12:53 - is more than likely going to be looking
12:55 - at
12:56 - tech related content that you do share
12:58 - especially on twitter okay and you're
13:00 - also staying culturally relevant to the
13:02 - overall developer community you're
13:04 - talking about hacktoberfest could be
13:06 - part but felt like i couldn't this year
13:09 - not only did i take part when i bagged a
13:11 - t-shirt oh okay so you did actually
13:13 - complete it yeah dude so highlight that
13:15 - too i mean like that that keeps you
13:18 - relevant that helps tell a story it
13:20 - shows that you're interested in open
13:22 - source that again goes to some of the
13:24 - projects like highlight some of those
13:27 - open source projects
13:28 - on your resume the the hr professionals
13:31 - may not fully understand what you're
13:33 - working on but if they see those
13:35 - projects they'll at least have a general
13:37 - idea okay this guy
13:39 - can do something let's get this in front
13:41 - of a hiring manager and get a second
13:42 - opinion get an informed opinion and then
13:44 - when a hiring manager sees it and he
13:46 - sees that you contribute to open source
13:48 - and he sees that you're culturally
13:49 - relevant to digital ocean and
13:52 - hacktoberfest and you're overall in the
13:55 - larger ecosystem of development and
13:57 - you're engaged that's gonna earn you a
13:59 - lot of brownie points but yeah all
14:02 - together man love this twitter account
14:04 - definitely highlight the open source
14:06 - projects that you worked on definitely
14:08 - highlight your sense of humor and i
14:10 - would say definitely highlight your
14:14 - your accomplishments with oktoberfest
14:15 - because
14:16 - that's that's no easy task so great job
14:19 - with that
14:19 - you have your portfolio we're just going
14:21 - to take a quick look at this okay so you
14:24 - have your social media links i'm not
14:25 - going to
14:26 - click through those click on here
14:29 - awesome that's
14:43 - about your focus okay cool
14:45 - credit apis in laravel framework and
14:47 - then you're talking about creating three
14:49 - applications
14:50 - uh crud and apis
14:53 - yeah there you go dude like that's
14:55 - that's some of your summary that's
14:57 - that's some of your project bullet
14:58 - points like seriously
15:00 - boom you got a highlight right there you
15:02 - know that's your that's your highlight
15:04 - reel man you gotta put that on the
15:06 - display front and center on your resume
15:08 - um
15:10 - okay cool and you're also talking about
15:12 - doing blogging and basic video tutorials
15:15 - um
15:16 - yeah then you can basically use this as
15:19 - your highlight reel to kind of start off
15:21 - the section for your articles on your
15:23 - cover letter
15:26 - okay and then you're also talking about
15:28 - your work with free code camp
15:31 - uh you're talking about your future
15:33 - goals
15:34 - fantastic as a junior developer people
15:36 - are really going to want to see that you
15:39 - still have plans to continue to grow and
15:41 - continue to improve yourself and that
15:43 - you're worth the investment of time and
15:46 - money that they're putting into hiring
15:47 - you as a junior asset
15:49 - definitely include something like that
15:50 - in your cover letter
15:52 - and i know this is controversial i would
15:55 - recommend including the photo
15:57 - in your cover letter or in your
16:00 - resume
16:02 - some people will strongly disagree with
16:03 - me on that but i think it's it's
16:05 - worthwhile uh you know maybe get one
16:07 - that's facing directly towards the
16:09 - camera and you know maybe wear like
16:12 - something relatively uh professional but
16:14 - overall this would be a fine photo as
16:16 - well
16:17 - okay but again yeah highlight reel men
16:20 - projects you've worked on but i'm front
16:21 - and center on that resume
16:25 - okay and
16:27 - yep you also have a
16:28 - portfolio looks like all of this is
16:31 - pertaining to
16:32 - the free code camp challenges cool
16:36 - but yeah i would definitely recommend
16:38 - putting in some highlights of
16:41 - the open source projects that you
16:43 - contributed to for hacktoberfest
16:46 - okay and then you have the contact me
16:49 - cool and that's nice and simple
16:51 - yeah in terms of the
16:53 - layout of this love it man nice and
16:55 - responsive
16:56 - you know this is definitely something
16:59 - i would also highlight in your
17:02 - resume
17:03 - probably near the top with some social
17:05 - media links and if you want to double
17:07 - down on that also highlight that on your
17:10 - cover letter because you want to get
17:12 - uh you know the these projects and these
17:15 - um
17:16 - bullet points that you
17:18 - you know that you've
17:20 - worked hard on in front of the the
17:21 - hiring manager and the hr professional
17:23 - cool it looks like you are uh
17:26 - highlighting things that you actually
17:27 - have worked on here and making use of
17:29 - the popular repositories
17:31 - so that's great
17:33 - you do have a fairly active graph here
17:35 - that's nice to see
17:37 - and cool and then here are some of the
17:40 - pull requests that you're working on for
17:41 - hacktoberfest with free code camp
