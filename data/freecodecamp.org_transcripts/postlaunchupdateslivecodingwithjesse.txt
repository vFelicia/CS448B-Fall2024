00:12 - hey
00:14 - everybody uh so yesterday at around 8:00
00:19 - pm finally got this site
00:22 - launched T out I had I think I had a
00:25 - total of four hours of live streaming
00:27 - yesterday and uh spent a lot of time I
00:31 - got in at 8 a.m. and I left at 900 p.m.
00:37 - so it's a pretty epic day of uh of
00:40 - getting this site ready I hope I don't
00:42 - have to do that again anytime soon and
00:45 - uh I'm still still a little bit sick uh
00:48 - so my voice is
00:50 - not not exactly normal right now so
00:53 - sorry for that but I got my Trello board
00:58 - up right now
01:02 - and
01:11 - um somebody typed in the in the live
01:14 - okay sorry I was a little confused my
01:16 - analytics were showing that basically
01:19 - nothing was happening and nobody was
01:20 - watching which is weird because I had
01:22 - people waiting okay
01:27 - um so I got my Trello board up here just
01:30 - to show you last night when I
01:35 - left these were all clear I had nothing
01:37 - in in this ready for development
01:40 - section I had nothing in this
01:44 - section so just from the emails that I
01:47 - got this morning when I got in these
01:50 - were all filled up and I've already
01:52 - knocked some of them out i' I've done
01:54 - some of them uh so I got in a little bit
01:57 - later than normal today slept in a
01:59 - little bit
02:01 - um so a lot of the changes are not
02:05 - really like a big deal some of them were
02:07 - just like a typo here or there probably
02:10 - the one that was the biggest deal was uh
02:12 - there were a couple of links that were
02:14 - going to the wrong
02:16 - places that's that's kind of a big deal
02:19 - it looks like maybe I
02:22 - um like I skipped I was just copy and
02:25 - pasting links and I think I skipped like
02:28 - one link and just kept going and so the
02:31 - last like three in a row were off by one
02:35 - so got that one fixed that was that was
02:37 - important to fix
02:39 - um the other
02:42 - ones I think I pushed that live with
02:45 - with some um some edits to the
02:49 - text all this other stuff is not like a
02:52 - huge deal except for this part so I have
02:54 - these in the end progress and this is
02:57 - what I want to try to accomplish at
02:59 - least most of this today uh I'm not
03:01 - going to put in a full day today because
03:04 - I I put in so much extra time this week
03:08 - uh so I'll probably have a short stream
03:10 - today and then uh get
03:12 - out uh a little bit
03:17 - early all right hey hey to everybody in
03:21 - the in the live chat okay now we've got
03:23 - now it's saying 45 viewers that's that's
03:26 - up closer to what what we normally have
03:31 - I think I have had over a hundred
03:33 - concurrent viewers at once before but I
03:36 - usually hover like around 50 I
03:39 - think
03:40 - um so I've been working on resizing
03:43 - images so I want to show you some some
03:45 - stuff some crazy stuff so I've been
03:47 - having adventures with image
03:49 - resizing uh so I'm going to pull this
03:52 - over and it's going to be hard to see so
03:54 - let me let me try to zoom
03:56 - in no that's there we go I'm G try to
04:00 - zoom this as much as I possibly can so
04:04 - you guys can see when I do the zoom like
04:06 - this I can't see the live chat or
04:07 - anything else so um I won't be able to
04:10 - see anything while we're while I'm I'm
04:12 - zoomed like this um okay so this is that
04:17 - big image on the
04:18 - homepage and I'll I'll read this all out
04:21 - in case you can't see it because it's
04:23 - kind of
04:24 - small um is 2.1 megabytes of an image on
04:29 - the the homepage just by converting it
04:32 - from a ping to a JPEG we've bought that
04:34 - down to 184
04:37 - kilobytes
04:39 - so that's that's pretty good uh
04:43 - conversion not bad I haven't even
04:45 - compress this and I haven't even
04:47 - attempted to resize it I'm a little bit
04:49 - nervous to resize this because I worked
04:52 - on the positioning so much I don't want
04:54 - to mess it up but for
04:56 - now um that's a big Improvement and it's
04:59 - going to be an even bigger one once I
05:01 - compress it uh also I have I have an
05:04 - even bigger one here so on on the page
05:07 - for um the court or for the events this
05:12 - was a
05:13 - ping 2.9 megabytes like that's crazy
05:18 - like I have whole sites like the
05:21 - homepage on a site that the entire page
05:24 - is less than that so that's crazy so
05:29 - just by changing this into a JPEG I got
05:32 - it down to 598 kilobytes and that's
05:35 - uncompressed so that's pretty awesome
05:37 - the other one that was a weird format
05:39 - and really surprising to me was this so
05:42 - this is a
05:44 - gif and I I don't know why this was in
05:46 - GIF format uh that's just it's weird to
05:50 - me why would I don't know why you'd use
05:52 - a gif unless you wanted it to be
05:54 - animated um maybe I'm just missing
05:57 - something but it was it was only 170
06:00 - kiloby not nearly as bad as as these
06:03 - other ones so I expected that it would
06:05 - actually go down uh in in
06:08 - size when I converted it to a JPEG but
06:11 - it didn't it actually went up that was
06:13 - really surprising so then I went ahead
06:15 - and optimized
06:17 - it and I got it down to 104 so from 170
06:21 - to 104 that's a decent uh decrease there
06:26 - uh but that was just kind of weird um so
06:29 - good to know a gif that's just a static
06:32 - image not animated
06:34 - gif
06:36 - is you know when you're talking about
06:39 - uncompressed it actually ends up being
06:41 - smaller than a JPEG
06:43 - so that's all I'm doing I'm also
06:45 - resizing some some things so I left I
06:48 - didn't delete the um the original
06:51 - versions yet because I wanted to show
06:52 - you this image is on the homepage look
06:55 - how huge it is
06:58 - 3,840 pixels wide okay so and that's
07:02 - it's actually not that it's only 270
07:05 - kilobytes so compared to these the some
07:08 - of these other ones we were loading it's
07:09 - not as nearly as bad but that is just a
07:12 - huge huge image so um so resized that to
07:18 - 700 and look at that I haven't even
07:20 - compressed it yet and I got it down to
07:21 - 14 kilobytes so much better I'll show
07:23 - you uh where that was on the on the site
07:27 - let me bring this over
07:30 - so that gigantic picture was just this
07:33 - at no point does this image ever get
07:36 - wider than 700 pixels and we had it at
07:38 - over 3,000 so the images that I had on
07:42 - the site were embarrassingly
07:44 - large and uh normally I would never put
07:48 - images that large on a site but when I
07:51 - got them I was so rushed I just whatever
07:54 - images I got I didn't I didn't even look
07:57 - at the size I just threw them on the
07:58 - site just to get them on there and have
08:00 - something to look at and then when it
08:03 - came down to it yesterday just ran out
08:05 - of time and didn't get to compress them
08:08 - so today I'm compressing them so sorry
08:12 - to anybody who tried to view this uh
08:14 - using your data plan on your
08:16 - phone uh I probably cost you you know a
08:21 - dollar or something trying to load this
08:24 - page all right let me check the live
08:27 - chat real quick since I got the uh the
08:29 - view back to
08:32 - normal all right someone ask can you
08:34 - just speak out my name please okay I'll
08:36 - try my best to say your
08:38 - name say it's SSAT
08:43 - day I'm not sure uh let me know if I did
08:46 - write on the
08:47 - pronunciation um I really do try to
08:51 - pronounce the everybody's names properly
08:53 - everybody always pronounces my name
08:55 - wrong so I'm I'm definitely aware of
08:57 - that um
09:06 - okay uh Melissa says what if you need to
09:08 - preserve transparency they're talking
09:09 - about the
09:11 - um uh the file
09:13 - formats
09:16 - so um yeah if you have so normally like
09:20 - a ping can have
09:21 - transparency and um a gif uh can have
09:26 - transparency I'm yeah I'm almost
09:28 - positive it can have
09:29 - transparency uh but normally if I wanted
09:32 - transparency I would just go with the
09:35 - Ping uh I don't know why that's just
09:37 - like always what what I've had to work
09:41 - with um although it does kind of seem
09:44 - like maybe the if the GF has
09:46 - transparency too maybe that would be a
09:48 - smaller file format I don't know I'll
09:50 - have to look into
09:53 - that
09:56 - um some of them uh I didn't really need
09:58 - them to be transparent anymore uh so I
10:01 - just converted them into jpegs cuz it
10:03 - would be smaller than a ping uh so if
10:06 - they were on
10:08 - like if I could convert them to a JPEG
10:10 - from a transparent background and they
10:12 - were going to be on white anyway and I'd
10:14 - keep the white background then it would
10:16 - work I don't I don't need the
10:17 - transparency the same way there was um
10:20 - some of them are on a black
10:23 - background I don't need um I didn't need
10:27 - to keep the uh transparency for for that
10:30 - but actually I
10:32 - probably I see what you're saying with
10:34 - that
10:36 - um this uh sandano uh GIF that we just
10:39 - looked
10:41 - at I forgot to check and see if it
10:44 - converted it to a black background or a
10:45 - white
10:46 - background some of them were converting
10:49 - black some were white I don't know why
10:51 - uh this one did white I might not be
10:52 - able to use
10:54 - it if anybody know I'm using image magic
10:57 - on the command line to convert the and
10:59 - I'll I'll bring over my command line in
11:01 - a second and show you how I'm doing this
11:04 - if anybody knows why sometimes I'm
11:06 - getting white backgrounds when I trans
11:08 - when I go from uh like a transparent
11:10 - format like a gif or ping to jpeg
11:13 - sometimes it's black sometimes it's
11:15 - white I don't know why if you know how I
11:17 - can set that let me know because that
11:19 - would be helpful and especially like I
11:22 - need this one to have a black background
11:23 - and it would work and there are some
11:25 - logos here that I need to have white
11:26 - backgrounds but they're giving me black
11:37 - sorry yeah Melissa is
11:39 - saiding y in the live chat um Melissa
11:43 - was basically like answering me and and
11:47 - I wasn't looking because I had my screen
11:49 - uh zoomed in on everything uh a few
11:51 - minutes ago and I couldn't I couldn't
11:53 - see the live chat
11:55 - so uh Sam says ping has better
11:58 - compression
12:10 - okay how you manage to get all your
12:13 - mails directly to Trello
12:16 - board all right somebody asked how I
12:18 - managed to get all my mails directly to
12:19 - Trail board um I'm not exactly
12:22 - sure what you're
12:26 - saying I um did I meant did I say
12:29 - somebody emails so the mail the emails
12:31 - didn't come directly in I just basically
12:33 - checked my emails and uh sorted them out
12:36 - into these so I I typed these out the
12:38 - emails didn't go directly in there
12:41 - although that would be cool if I could
12:43 - wout my emails directly in the tro I
12:45 - probably could do that with zapier uh
12:48 - just set up a task to um check my email
12:50 - and put it direct directly in a trailer
12:52 - board but all right let's uh let's do
12:57 - some some comp I think out of all this
13:01 - list probably the thing that's the most
13:05 - interesting right now that needs done is
13:07 - is this image stuff uh and that's just
13:11 - because um if if you're not that good
13:14 - with Photoshop like me then it's a lot
13:17 - easier to just use the command line to
13:19 - edit your
13:20 - images so I'm going to show you how I'm
13:22 - doing that
13:26 - here I did do a video a while ago
13:29 - on image compression so if you saw that
13:32 - some of this is going to be the same but
13:33 - I I am going to show how to resize which
13:36 - I didn't show that on uh on that video
13:40 - so I've got this I just sorted things
13:42 - out by
13:44 - um like subfolders inside my image
13:47 - folder on my local version of the site
13:50 - just to keep things organized for me and
13:52 - then I can see how it looks and move it
13:55 - into the main folder later on I I'll
13:57 - clean it up and getting rid of all these
13:58 - sub folders
13:59 - uh before I push this uh to the server
14:05 - so basically I'm going through the the
14:08 - homepage everything's already good I I
14:10 - still need to get a black background
14:12 - version of this that's may be a JPEG
14:15 - this is not really a huge file I'm not
14:17 - super concerned but um I want to try to
14:20 - get as small as I
14:22 - can all right so this image was really
14:25 - big and now it's now it's
14:27 - smaller let's take a at these ones uh so
14:32 - man I go through and expect it I I have
14:34 - the files locally
14:35 - but you know otherwise you could just go
14:38 - inev tools and
14:40 - inspect okay see this picture naturally
14:43 - it's saying it's let me blow this up a
14:45 - little bit so you can
14:46 - see um it's saying that naturally this
14:49 - is
14:50 - 755 pixels wide but it's only displaying
14:54 - at 371 so that's a little bit wider than
14:56 - we need uh on my other screen I'm going
15:00 - to find this image real quick and move
15:04 - it to the folder the resize
15:09 - folder oh wow it's actually even larger
15:11 - uh than that it's um it's saying here
15:15 - with it's 1,400 pixels wide that's way
15:17 - bigger than we
15:19 - need all right so let me let me drop
15:22 - this in the resize folder and then we
15:26 - will resize it right on the command line
15:29 - and I might as well drop these two in as
15:34 - well so these ones that I've already
15:37 - resized in the folder I'm going to get
15:39 - rid
15:45 - of and I'm I'm doing this on my other
15:48 - screen so you can uh don't worry if
15:51 - you're not seeing
15:53 - it it's just literally I'm I'm moving
15:56 - them to the
15:57 - trash okay
16:09 - okay uh Patrick said he just looked it
16:11 - up try the um the background option so I
16:15 - can pass a flag as a background and pass
16:17 - it the
16:18 - color oh
16:21 - awesome uh let me finish getting these
16:26 - uh these images in the right folder
16:28 - first and then I'm going to try what
16:29 - what Patrick just uh suggested thank you
16:32 - for looking that up that's awesome if if
16:35 - you've ever seen the image magic
16:37 - documentation it's like super thorough
16:39 - but it is it's like trying to just take
16:42 - a dictionary and start reading it I mean
16:44 - it's there's so
16:46 - much um it's just it's hard to go
16:49 - through it it it's easier to try to find
16:51 - something on sack overflow than to go
16:53 - through that
16:55 - documentation uh okay pet oh man yeah we
17:00 - we definitely need to resize these
17:01 - images uh this one here is over 2,000
17:04 - pixels
17:06 - wide um and then we have one
17:14 - more
17:16 - okay yeah and that that third one also
17:19 - needs resize that's over th
17:21 - pixels okay so let
17:24 - me let's check out our um our folder
17:27 - that we're doing for conversion so I'm
17:29 - going to go
17:31 - out hopefully um let me know oops let me
17:34 - know if you can't see uh
17:37 - this command line stuff right here if it
17:41 - needs to be bigger
17:47 - um I'm going to go into this folder I
17:50 - mean you don't necessarily have to be in
17:52 - the folder you could do the command uh
17:55 - and just go that path but it's easier uh
17:58 - to see what's going on like
18:00 - this uh convert there we go okay so we
18:04 - have our
18:06 - original
18:07 - sandano um GIF okay and that's what we
18:11 - want to have a black background so we're
18:13 - going to do
18:16 - convert and
18:20 - um we're going to use what was it
18:26 - background let me see
18:29 - where where was Patrick's
18:30 - helmet background
18:34 - and how do we get pass to the color we
18:36 - just do a space and pass it is that I
18:39 - didn't actually see documentation we'll
18:41 - try it like this this is a copy anyway
18:43 - if I mess it up but it's no big deal
18:47 - um so can I just pass black do I have to
18:51 - use a hex color um we'll just try it
18:54 - with black for
18:56 - now um
18:58 - and we'll go
19:00 - um the
19:05 - sandano GIF and
19:07 - then we want to convert that to the JPEG
19:10 - and we'll just we'll just overwrite that
19:13 - other one all right let's see what
19:25 - happened nope
19:30 - all right I'll have to look that one up
19:31 - but it's good to know now I know what to
19:33 - look up I'll look up the background
19:34 - option and see exactly how to do
19:37 - it all right Melissa says she's a
19:39 - Photoshop girl doesn't understand the
19:41 - programming yet uh command line is very
19:43 - interesting yeah um that's cool I have
19:46 - there's a guy that that works with me
19:47 - that is really awesome with Photoshop uh
19:50 - but he's on vacation this week so that's
19:52 - why normally I wouldn't even be doing
19:54 - all this stuff I would maybe just run
19:56 - like a batch compression uh for the
19:58 - command line on the whole like all my
20:01 - images but that would be it and he would
20:02 - handle everything else um so oh thank
20:07 - you Melissa Melissa said the website is
20:09 - beautiful uh
20:12 - thanks uh the code editor is Adam
20:15 - a I always do that uh people ask
20:18 - questions in the live chat and then uh
20:20 - they get answered like in the next line
20:22 - but I don't read ahead before I
20:26 - answer uh mobin ask aren't there tools
20:29 - to automatically do that uh yeah
20:31 - basically um there are tools I I've had
20:36 - um I've used gulp before and I've set it
20:39 - up to just use um image magic
20:43 - like when I do my build process it just
20:45 - goes in and resizes and optimizes all my
20:48 - images for
20:49 - me it works really well when you have a
20:52 - lot of images that are all going to be
20:54 - like a standard width and so you know
20:57 - what but if you have lots of different
20:59 - size images it's not quite as easy so I
21:02 - didn't set that up with this project cuz
21:03 - I'm using webpack and uh and I'm not
21:06 - using gulp I'm not
21:08 - nearly as knowledgeable about web pack
21:11 - and I'm not comfortable yet doing stuff
21:13 - like that probably I need to make like
21:14 - an just an npm script or something to do
21:16 - it but at this point there are not that
21:18 - many images so it's not a big deal to
21:20 - just do it uh by
21:22 - hand and if you're using a Content
21:25 - management system like WordPress you
21:27 - upload a file it does all the resizing
21:29 - for
21:32 - you uh someone asked is this python uh
21:36 - no um this is well right now I'm on the
21:39 - command
21:40 - line um and then the code over here is
21:45 - this is CSS and we've
21:47 - got HTML mixed in with JavaScript here
21:51 - uh it's a particular JavaScript
21:53 - framework called react so that's what
21:56 - we're working with um
22:00 - let's
22:04 - see oh uh Jac Jac Simon is that how you
22:08 - pronounce that Jac okay um sorry if I
22:11 - mispronounce it Jock's new to coding uh
22:14 - he loves free code Camp
22:19 - awesome Sam has a site
22:22 - uh he can um run uh images through for
22:26 - compression
22:34 - okay cool Melissa did ask about the
22:36 - programs I'm using I do have links to
22:38 - all of them in the um in the description
22:40 - so check out the description uh this is
22:42 - Adam this is my text editor I'm using
22:44 - the set theme that's s TI uh people are
22:47 - always interested in a theme and I don't
22:49 - have that listed this is iterm 2 I'm
22:52 - using for the terminal and then you know
22:54 - this is just Dev tools that comes with
22:56 - uh Chrome uh and then my project
22:59 - management stuff in the background is
23:01 - Trello all right so let me show you um
23:05 - how I'm resizing these
23:07 - images so I'm going to go back into the
23:09 - resize
23:13 - folder
23:17 - um and I'll show you I have those three
23:20 - images that we were looking at let me
23:22 - let me bring up the site so we can see
23:23 - it uh and the cool part is going to be
23:26 - to compare this local version
23:28 - to the version that's live after we do
23:31 - these compressions and we can actually
23:33 - just see like what the size of that page
23:36 - is in terms of like megabytes and there
23:39 - there'll be a significant uh
23:41 - difference that'll help with load times
23:44 - too um the site seems really fast like
23:48 - faster than it should be because it's
23:49 - prefetching a lot of stuff in the
23:51 - background and we're using a service
23:52 - worker uh but it's still loading more
23:55 - than I want it to load you just don't
23:57 - notice it as much uh since we set it up
24:00 - like this so I'm going to go in and uh
24:04 - we're going to use a command
24:06 - called
24:08 - mriy okay so this is from image magic 2
24:11 - it's just like pretty much just like
24:13 - using the convert command except this is
24:16 - when you want to do like a batch
24:18 - conversion so we're going to do that and
24:21 - we're going to use the flight
24:24 - resize and I'm going to pass in well we
24:27 - need to see what we want how big we want
24:29 - these to be so basically I'll just
24:32 - check and I'm just going to insc this
24:34 - and see how big this is we have 409
24:37 - pixels
24:38 - across and you want to try out because
24:41 - when we go down lower these are going to
24:43 - be full width and so I just want to make
24:45 - sure this might actually be our largest
24:47 - size the other one was what
24:49 - 204 oh and this one
24:53 - is let's
24:55 - see five
24:59 - 37 yeah 537 across I'm going to make
25:03 - these 600 I like to go a little bit over
25:06 - um it just gives us some leeway in
25:09 - case in case I missed something like I
25:12 - missed a break point or something where
25:13 - it was
25:14 - bigger I just round up a little bit uh
25:17 - so we're going to go 600 if you just
25:19 - type in one number into this
25:21 - command uh
25:23 - then it's just the width and it keeps
25:26 - your aspect ratio and changes the height
25:28 - height in proportion so that's what we
25:31 - want and the last thing I need to do is
25:33 - tell it uh what type of files I wanted
25:36 - to do this on let me let me make sure I
25:39 - get this um this is right okay um so
25:44 - we're going to
25:46 - use an
25:48 - asterisk and we're going to say all
25:52 - these are jpegs
25:53 - right
25:56 - yep okay
25:58 - so I'm going to bring over
26:02 - my my files
26:06 - again and I'm going to do a zoom
26:09 - again and we're going to see let me
26:12 - bring this oops that's not it is
26:17 - it a shoot I grabbed the wrong image I
26:20 - have to do
26:21 - it um one more time
26:25 - but the um the zoom feature on a I'm not
26:28 - great with okay here we go this is what
26:31 - I want you to see we're at 600 now so
26:34 - all these that were in this folder are
26:35 - now at 600 I didn't really want this one
26:37 - in here we'll just delete
26:39 - that what I really wanted so we we'll
26:42 - take
26:44 - these and um we're just going to move
26:47 - them in here into this
26:49 - folder and I'll say yeah I want them to
26:52 - replace that and that's it they're
26:53 - already replaced um I I have backups all
26:56 - these somewhere so I'm comfortable just
26:58 - kind of doing that and then but we
27:00 - missed an image we missed uh what was it
27:04 - the father Nathan's
27:07 - image where was
27:11 - that there it was yeah so this one's
27:14 - still
27:15 - huge yep let's just do a conversion
27:18 - right there in place on
27:22 - that all right
27:25 - so we're going to do just the the one
27:27 - picture version of
27:31 - this 600 and we're going to go if we
27:34 - wanted to do it just on one image father
27:37 - Nathan uh jpeg that's how we do it I'm
27:40 - not going to change the name I just
27:41 - wanted to convert that one
27:46 - oops I thought I thought that was the
27:49 - image name
27:50 - right we just had it there did I miss
27:53 - something or is
27:56 - that yeah that's it
28:14 - H that's really weird not sure what's
28:16 - going on there I'll work on that later
28:19 - maybe the syntax is different when
28:20 - you're trying to do one image um not
28:23 - sure about that um
28:29 - I'm I'm going to check the live chat I'm
28:30 - kind of having like a relaxed day
28:32 - yesterday was insane so uh a little bit
28:35 - more slow paac than normal uh live
28:41 - stream uh someone's I I mentioned I use
28:44 - I term and uh naine says it's only for
28:47 - Mac with a frowny face so yeah it's only
28:50 - for Mac I forget there's something for
28:53 - PC that um what do I use on my PC shoot
28:57 - I can't remember I'm sorry there's
28:59 - something like it term for the PC I just
29:02 - can't remember what it is I haven't
29:03 - worked I have a PC at
29:05 - home uh but I haven't worked on it for a
29:08 - long time I usually just use my um my
29:16 - MacBook okay
29:19 - so somebody asked what what did I miss
29:21 - so far um basically we're just going
29:23 - over uh image resizing and um image
29:28 - conversions and I'm going to show some
29:30 - image compression here in a minute and
29:32 - then uh then I'm going to kind of wrap
29:35 - it up I'll just you know go to the live
29:36 - chat and um and wrap it
29:39 - up
29:43 - uh shoot I totally forgot I wanted to
29:45 - show another uh video interview from the
29:47 - the conference I was at last week but I
29:49 - I totally forgot I'll have to remember
29:51 - and do it on Monday um because I want to
29:53 - make sure I um I tag that person uh on
29:57 - Twitter tter when I when I do the
30:00 - interview all right so let me just show
30:03 - you how I do these uh compressions then
30:07 - uh let's find an image that's pretty
30:10 - big so that we can do a nice a nice
30:13 - compression on so which one was
30:16 - big all right let's try Okay this
30:18 - monstrance image is huge it's 848
30:21 - kilobytes so let's compress this
30:23 - thing so I'm going to go I
30:26 - keep I keep these
30:30 - um in my my Google keep in a note there
30:34 - uh so I can just copy and paste them
30:35 - real quick because they're way too long
30:36 - for me to remember so I'm going to go
30:39 - right in here and I'm going to copy that
30:42 - now this is crazy long I'll go through
30:43 - it in in just a second so we're using
30:46 - convert so this is just the single file
30:48 - version of this there's a a batch
30:50 - version and then there's a recursive
30:52 - version you can do on multiple folders
30:53 - which is really
30:55 - cool uh for now I'm just going to show
30:58 - this if you look at my video from a
30:59 - couple weeks ago on image um compression
31:02 - I think I went through all of them even
31:04 - the the uh more advanced ones so we're
31:07 - just going to do strip that's stripping
31:09 - out all like the metad data that we
31:10 - don't need some of these I'm going to be
31:13 - honest with you I don't know what they
31:14 - all do I just um I found this online
31:18 - somewhere and I can't remember where I
31:20 - wish I could remember because I would I
31:22 - would you know give the link and give
31:24 - credit for this but I've actually seen
31:27 - this in a couple of plac places so I'm
31:28 - not really sure where it originated
31:31 - from so basically these are all just
31:34 - various quality 85 this is about the
31:36 - only one I can understand the strip and
31:38 - the quality 85 uh percent I'm not sure
31:42 - what the other ones do because I'm not
31:43 - really into uh you know images and stuff
31:47 - so these ones at the end this is the one
31:50 - that you want to convert and this is
31:52 - what you want it to be named after you
31:54 - converted okay so that's it so let me go
31:58 - here
32:00 - and uh what was that M Mo here we go
32:04 - monstrance uh this is like kind of a
32:07 - basic command line thing but if you
32:08 - don't know all I typed was n and I knew
32:11 - there were no there's only one file in
32:13 - that folder that starts with m Mo so I
32:15 - just hit Tab and it autoc completed the
32:18 - rest for me so that saves a lot of time
32:21 - typing so if you only remember one thing
32:24 - from today's stream remember that and
32:25 - it'll save you so much time and I I just
32:28 - want it to be called the same
32:35 - thing sometimes I put like- op at the
32:38 - end so I know that I can pressed it
32:41 - but um I just want this to to go
32:45 - in actually yeah I do want to compare it
32:47 - let's put the dash op just just so that
32:50 - we can compare the sizes just for uh for
32:53 - demonstration purposes okay so now it
32:55 - won't before it would have overwritten
32:57 - uh that that file now it won't all
33:02 - right and that's it let's let's check it
33:04 - out let's see what see what happened
33:07 - here okay so we have this one is 2,000
33:11 - I'll zoom in a little
33:13 - bit so still a big image 2000 you know
33:17 - with but 848
33:21 - kilobytes now let's check out how we did
33:24 - here there we go 429 9 kiloby so we got
33:29 - that thing
33:31 - down um almost half almost halfway down
33:35 - and considering where we started so this
33:37 - is what's on the live site right now
33:40 - this gigantic thing that's what 2 point
33:43 - it just going off the edge at 2.1
33:45 - megabytes and now we're down we've got
33:48 - down to
33:51 - 429
33:52 - kilobytes so that's what less than 25%
33:56 - of the size of that that's huge
33:58 - um so that's a huge Improvement on that
34:02 - image it's still a bigger bigger image
34:04 - than I would like to load but I'm I'm
34:07 - happy with that that's a pretty big
34:09 - Improvement and we can go back here and
34:12 - you know let's go back into this page
34:14 - Oops I meant to go to the homepage we'll
34:17 - go back into the homepage just to show
34:19 - that there's no loss of
34:22 - quality I think my server first again
34:25 - sorry whoa you okay can't appear as a
34:28 - descendant of actually got a legit
34:30 - warning that's
34:33 - weird oh UL cannot appear as a
34:37 - descendant of P we have to change that
34:39 - we did that
34:41 - yesterday um let's see if this work no
34:44 - it's still not
34:46 - working if you guys watched yesterday I
34:49 - was trying to I just put a a UL like an
34:52 - unordered list inside of a P tag and uh
34:57 - I wasn't sure what would happen I just
35:00 - wanted to see uh if it would work and
35:03 - evidently it it's giving me a warning so
35:05 - maybe I want to fix that it's not like
35:08 - breaking anything yet it's just a
35:09 - warning but I don't I don't want like a
35:13 - later update to you know break anything
35:15 - so basically here's that image uh all
35:20 - compressed and converted and
35:23 - compressed um these ones the same thing
35:26 - significantly uh resize down I'm going
35:29 - to bring in the this is the live site
35:32 - that has the UN uncompressed unres
35:36 - versions and we're going to look at them
35:38 - side by side just to show that there's
35:42 - really like no noticeable
35:44 - difference in
35:48 - quality all right so let's go up
35:53 - here I mean I see
36:00 - you know I can't tell the difference I
36:02 - don't know if you all can tell I mean
36:04 - I'll get we'll Zoom really
36:07 - close I mean even zoomed in look at that
36:11 - crazy this image on the left is less
36:14 - than 25% the size than this image on the
36:18 - right is and they look identical uh
36:22 - that's just
36:23 - awesome so no perceptible loss of
36:28 - quality okay and these ones will be
36:31 - you'll see the same thing same
36:35 - way zoom in on
36:42 - these this one you can actually see a
36:44 - bit let me show it looks to me like you
36:47 - can when you zoom in you can definitely
36:49 - see because of the
36:51 - letters so you definitely can see it on
36:53 - that one let's zoom out and see so I'm
36:56 - not that worried about people zooming in
36:59 - but yeah zoomed out it looks
37:05 - good but yeah you can if you look really
37:08 - closely you can tell there's a
37:09 - difference on these
37:12 - images
37:16 - so they don't look pixelated or anything
37:18 - but there's a slight change but you know
37:20 - once again we got a big Improvement on
37:22 - these from resizing these so I'll may
37:25 - maybe I'll look at them again sometime
37:26 - and see if I need to make make them a
37:27 - little bit uh larger but I mean these
37:30 - are 700 you know pixels in width and
37:33 - these boxes are not nearly 700 pixels so
37:35 - they should be
37:37 - fine all right um I'm going to go I'm
37:41 - going to check the live chat I'm gonna
37:43 - you know I'm going to wrap this up I'm
37:45 - not going to go really long today since
37:46 - I went so long yesterday so let me go to
37:48 - the live chat I'm going to answer all
37:50 - your questions
37:51 - now if you don't want to stick around
37:53 - for the for the questions uh that's cool
37:56 - uh I'll I'll be back oh maybe not Monday
38:00 - Monday's a holiday here um in the United
38:02 - States so I won't be working and I'll
38:05 - probably be at a picnic at my
38:07 - grandfather's house so I'll see you on
38:12 - Tuesday and um but if you want to stick
38:15 - around for question and answer go ahead
38:16 - and throw some questions in the live
38:18 - chat uh and I'm going to I'm going to
38:21 - keep going till I get to the bottom um
38:24 - and unless there's just an insane amount
38:26 - of questions then I'll have to cut it
38:27 - off but I'll keep going so I get to the
38:28 - bottom answer the questions uh as best I
38:37 - can all right so I'm I'm way I'm kind of
38:40 - back like halfway up the chat now uh I
38:42 - stopped where when Sam was talking about
38:44 - image compression the site where you can
38:46 - just drag and drop files right on the
38:48 - site I do use those sites sometimes um I
38:52 - but I have found that that command line
38:55 - that command on the command line has
38:56 - been able to get IM is smaller with no
38:59 - loss of quality than anything I've ever
39:00 - used before uh be it command line tools
39:04 - or or photoshop stuff or um even those
39:07 - websites where you can drag and drop I
39:09 - so this this has just blown me away in
39:13 - terms of the the quality uh and the the
39:17 - size of what you
39:20 - get
39:24 - okay all right Patrick actually did put
39:27 - the command that I needed uh in here so
39:31 - thank you Patrick I'm not going to try
39:32 - it right now um but I'm definitely gonna
39:36 - I'm going to copy and paste this right
39:38 - now and I'm going put it in
39:42 - my uh in Google
39:45 - Keep so that I can remember
39:48 - it I also um I do go back and look
39:51 - through all these live chats so if I
39:52 - don't get to your comment like I'll see
39:54 - it um you know or you could just throw
39:57 - in the comments in the video or direct
39:58 - message me on Twitter uh if if you have
40:01 - any you know something you want to ask
40:02 - me uh I'm I'm totally fine with
40:21 - that all right so far not a lot of
40:24 - questions where I'm going um I'm I'm
40:26 - looking uh you all were kind of talking
40:29 - to each
40:31 - other oh yeah somebody from um from
40:35 - Ukraine awesome thanks for
40:43 - watching all right homberto said are you
40:45 - scoped correctly didn't see the folder
40:47 - structure uh I think that was when I
40:49 - was we yeah when I was trying to use
40:52 - this um commands
40:55 - here um
40:58 - yeah I don't know maybe was I in the
41:00 - wrong folder I thought I was in the I
41:03 - was in the image folder oh well and I
41:05 - did Patrick mentioned I was um I I used
41:10 - uh mogrify last time I was using convert
41:12 - this time so it's possible that the
41:15 - syntax is just different between the two
41:17 - commands and I messed that up but uh if
41:19 - you're only going to do one image um
41:22 - then convert works for one image usually
41:29 - uh I think
41:31 - somebody so Hunter said there's um CMD R
41:36 - uh for
41:38 - Windows that's the program that I use on
41:40 - Windows and so it's the equivalent of I
41:43 - term for Mac so for everybody that was
41:45 - asking about that earlier it's cmde
41:49 - R that's that's the name of program for
41:51 - Windows um so check that one out
41:54 - definitely better than the default um
41:57 - command line for
42:07 - Windows Melissa says the smaller images
42:10 - will load faster that that's yeah the
42:12 - smaller images will definitely load
42:13 - faster it h a big
42:15 - difference uh especially if you're on
42:18 - like a mobile connection I try to test
42:20 - all my sites and on a 3G like I I just
42:23 - throttle the network in Dev tools um
42:25 - down to 3G so I'll show you here if you
42:28 - go into Dev tools into Network
42:29 - conditions you can turn it down so I
42:32 - usually go with 3G and then I'll go in
42:34 - and um refresh the page and just see
42:38 - like
42:39 - what
42:41 - um actually this is the wrong this is
42:44 - the wrong Dev
42:45 - tools I got my other one over here on
42:48 - this screen
42:51 - um maybe show you how
42:55 - this how I do this okay so I've set this
42:58 - to 3G I refresh the page and it will
43:01 - tell me
43:02 - like um how many requests so you can
43:06 - basically see like these are all the
43:08 - images that are
43:11 - requested um on your homage and you can
43:14 - easily see like you know how how big
43:16 - they were how much time it's taking this
43:19 - like never finishes loading uh because
43:22 - it's still doing things in the
43:25 - background uh so
43:28 - this oh yeah it finally did you see
43:32 - there's still there's like this T this
43:35 - thing that keeps on loading over and
43:37 - over again so that's insane I can't
43:40 - believe it took that
43:44 - long and I do disable the cash when I do
43:47 - this to simulate somebody coming to the
43:49 - site for the first time
43:52 - um anyway but usually when I test sites
43:55 - I that's how I do so I'll I'll compare
43:58 - I'll do a test like before I change
44:00 - something and I'll do a test after to
44:01 - see if I actually had a positive impact
44:03 - on the sight
44:13 - speed some
44:15 - says Hamza says you didn't change the
44:17 - name though after
44:22 - optimizing you're right I did not change
44:25 - the name after optimizing that's a good
44:26 - C
44:29 - I can't believe I did that all
44:31 - right that's why it looked identical
44:34 - because it
44:35 - was pretty it was pretty much
44:37 - identical um all right let's take this
44:41 - to
44:49 - uh
44:51 - okay so yeah so before I hadn't actually
44:57 - been loading the the new
45:00 - image still loading the old image uh so
45:03 - let's compare
45:07 - now let's Zoom that
45:13 - in all right
45:15 - so it's actually still really
45:21 - good I can't tell the
45:25 - difference all right so yeah that is the
45:27 - new one just to we'll we'll just prove
45:30 - it here
45:31 - just uh to double check yep it is it's
45:34 - the one that says op in
45:36 - there so yeah so that
45:39 - officially not the last time but this
45:42 - officially is less than 25% the size of
45:46 - this one on the right and it
45:49 - looks
45:51 - identical even zoomed
45:53 - in so once again that's awesome and it's
45:57 - actually legit this
45:59 - time so good catch you caught that again
46:03 - that
46:05 - was Hamza all right so uh or Hamza I'm
46:09 - not sure how to pronounce that uh so M
46:12 - Hamza thank you for that
46:16 - catch um someone asked Jesse Gulp or
46:21 - grunt I used to use grunt a few years
46:24 - ago but I switched to gulp
46:28 - um
46:30 - gulps gulps seem to me easier to
46:33 - configure like the configuration for
46:36 - gulp is just like writing JavaScript
46:38 - it's it's more
46:40 - familiar uh also it seems faster so
46:44 - that's why I made the
46:46 - switch
46:48 - um I think if you're like really used to
46:54 - grunt I don't see any reason like if if
46:57 - you're happy with it I would say maybe I
46:59 - mean
47:01 - I'm I'm not like an expert at this but I
47:05 - would work on learning
47:08 - webpack uh they're not exactly like the
47:10 - same thing uh because webpack does other
47:13 - stuff but uh check out webpack if you
47:17 - want to do like react and things like
47:19 - that if you're just doing regular
47:21 - websites I would try to learn how to do
47:23 - everything you're doing in grunt but
47:25 - using just regular um scripts so like
47:28 - npm scripts to do it you can do it all
47:31 - it simplifies things and um I've been
47:34 - trying to learn how to do it as well
47:36 - that's my my advice uh if you don't know
47:39 - gulp
47:40 - yet I don't worry about using it just go
47:43 - Um try to use npm scripts and
47:50 - webpack Melissa says I still have a
47:53 - question about which command line tool
47:55 - to use in Windows okay and naine said
47:58 - yeah that
47:59 - CMD uh works good so yeah that's that's
48:02 - the one that um that I
48:08 - use valenda just joined in from Brazil
48:13 - working as a software developer in the
48:15 - UK um in London so awesome thanks for
48:20 - watching uh you kind of joined in here
48:22 - at the at the end we did some image
48:24 - resizing and compression uh conver
48:27 - straight from the command line today um
48:30 - we got some good results this video will
48:32 - be available the recording will be
48:34 - available like right after I I end the
48:37 - stream
48:39 - um Bill asks what do you use for hosting
48:42 - the WordPress that you utilize and
48:44 - calling the API uh I'm hosting it on a
48:46 - droplet on digital ocean right
48:48 - now uh you don't have to do it like that
48:51 - if you have like a shared hosting
48:53 - provider you can still use the API
48:55 - straight from there it's built into
48:56 - WordPress now
48:58 - so um yeah any any place that let you
49:02 - host WordPress as long as they don't
49:04 - lock down your plugins like um like
49:07 - there there are some uh WordPress
49:10 - specific hosts I can't remember the
49:12 - there's one in particular I worked with
49:14 - that you there are only certain plugins
49:16 - you could add so I wouldn't go with
49:18 - something like that because you want the
49:19 - freedom to
49:20 - customize um but most of your shared
49:23 - hosting will allow you to you know you
49:26 - you can do WordPress or you can set it
49:28 - up on digital o I'm actually running it
49:29 - on a $5 droplet uh because since I'm
49:33 - only using the API I don't really need
49:34 - anything more powerful and I'm going to
49:36 - do a lot of caching and I actually
49:38 - haven't even turned on the caching yet
49:39 - on the WordPress side of things so the
49:41 - site's still like pretty decently fast
49:45 - I'm going to turn it on after we get
49:46 - most of the content
49:49 - in uh World boss asks Are You full stack
49:54 - I would not call myself a full stack
49:56 - developer I do some things that that
49:59 - would be considered full stack when I
50:01 - have to but I would say at least 80% of
50:04 - what I do is is clearly frontend stuff
50:08 - occasionally I do stuff that would be
50:10 - considered
50:11 - devops um like setting up you know
50:14 - servers and stuff and build processes
50:16 - and things like that and that's just
50:17 - because I don't have anybody I'm the
50:19 - only front-end developer at the whole
50:22 - university right now uh so there's not
50:25 - really there's another guy in my
50:27 - department that's he's he's really good
50:29 - with
50:32 - stuff um so he can help out uh but it's
50:37 - not like technically his job to do
50:39 - things like that uh so basically I got
50:41 - to do whatever I have to do um to uh to
50:46 - make the SC work but I would I wouldn't
50:49 - put it on my
50:51 - resume uh as a front end I that wouldn't
50:53 - be honest to me uh to do to say I was
50:56 - full stack I would but I'm confident
50:58 - saying front
51:00 - end which pre-processor do I use so
51:04 - Carol says uh is asking this what
51:07 - pre-processor um for my uh CSS I use SAS
51:13 - so I write it in SAS and then trans
51:16 - convert it
51:17 - over um I was editing just some straight
51:20 - CSS towards the end of this pro project
51:23 - um I just didn't I was really close to
51:27 - launching and um I didn't have the
51:30 - automatic conversion set up on the react
51:32 - site I had it on like the previous
51:34 - version of this site which was
51:36 - static and um so I didn't have time to
51:40 - go through and set that up uh but I do
51:42 - like
51:47 - SAS I'll probably switch up there's some
51:49 - new stuff coming out with CSS though so
51:51 - when that starts to get supported I'm I
51:54 - may or may not continue to use SAS we'll
51:56 - see
51:57 - uh ham Hamza okay so earlier I
52:00 - mispronounced um hamza's name uh it's I
52:04 - I said Hamza that's not correct it's
52:07 - Hamza so thanks thanks for telling me
52:10 - how it's uh how it's actually pronounced
52:13 - I I really do want to know and uh
52:15 - pronounce uh your names
52:18 - correctly uh Hunter says uh they agree
52:22 - the config for gulp is better it is also
52:24 - faster because it uses no stram okay so
52:27 - that seems like a a more knowledgeable
52:29 - answer than the one I gave even um he
52:32 - says in particular it's using node
52:34 - streams so it's faster actually yeah
52:38 - you're definitely right I I had
52:39 - forgotten that part of it uh so correct
52:42 - me if I'm wrong but this was my
52:44 - understanding whenever I switched is
52:46 - that um grunt would step through all
52:49 - your processes like one at a time but
52:52 - gulp has the ability to um do like
52:55 - multiple things at mons so that's how it
52:58 - can do it so much
53:00 - faster so I I it's been a couple years
53:04 - since I've actually even read anything
53:05 - about that but I think that was that was
53:08 - the reason uh Hamza ask planning to do a
53:12 - stream on the caching
53:14 - part yeah maybe I'll um I didn't show
53:17 - any of the WordPress side of things so
53:20 - if there's interest in that maybe I'll
53:22 - do that maybe I'll show like how I set
53:25 - up um I did a plugin uh like a custom
53:28 - plugin and PHP to set up custom post
53:32 - types um maybe I'll show that and then
53:35 - show um the plugin I I actually am using
53:37 - a plugin for caching so maybe I'll I'll
53:40 - do a little bit uh of that as well um if
53:43 - if you all want to see
53:46 - that uh all right Melissa said thanks
53:49 - for taking time out other day uh you're
53:51 - welcome Melissa um this is awesome and
53:54 - it's not just I don't see this as like
53:57 - me helping you out so much as us like
54:01 - collaborating because uh you all you
54:04 - know catch my mistakes and uh give me a
54:07 - lot of good uh good feedback and and
54:10 - good ideas so I think it's a mutually
54:13 - beneficial relationship here that we
54:15 - have going on
54:18 - YouTube um all right I think we're at
54:21 - the bottom we only have two more two
54:22 - more um comments here to go through um
54:28 - man
54:30 - Adia all right I'm sorry if I
54:32 - mispronounced that it's looking like
54:35 - Adia
54:37 - um asks are react components responsive
54:40 - by default if not then you use
54:42 - materialize or just medic yeah so a
54:45 - react component is is not anything by
54:48 - default really it's whatever you want to
54:50 - make it so these are responsive because
54:53 - I use materialize and materialize is a
54:56 - frame workk that's responsive and then
54:58 - also I added my own media queries where
55:01 - I needed them so um there were there
55:04 - were some spots where I just needed some
55:06 - more like fine grain control over the
55:09 - positioning of things so I added in some
55:12 - extra media
55:13 - queries on top of what comes and
55:16 - materialized uh but that's that's how it
55:19 - was so um so I guess react by
55:23 - itself doesn't really um it doesn't come
55:27 - with any markup by itself so whatever
55:30 - markup you give it it'll just do that so
55:32 - if you give it responsive markup it'll
55:34 - be responsive if not it won't all right
55:37 - last one of the day unless somebody puts
55:40 - something in here in the next couple
55:41 - seconds from
55:43 - Val um he asks join the show late and
55:48 - asks
55:50 - um how long have I been coding in JS in
55:54 - JavaScript
55:57 - um okay
55:59 - so I'll give two answers I first started
56:02 - when I was in high school with like
56:05 - super basic
56:07 - stuff
56:08 - um and I didn't do anything with it for
56:11 - a long time so we're talking like early
56:14 - 2000s right
56:16 - so maybe 15 or 16 years ago I didn't do
56:21 - anything with it for a long time until I
56:24 - was already um
56:29 - probably maybe like five years ago four
56:33 - or five years ago I got back
56:36 - into doing websites and things and uh as
56:40 - I as I kind of got deeper into it and
56:43 - had to do more complicated things for my
56:45 - clients I was freelancing doing like
56:48 - some subcontracting work I started
56:50 - clients started asking for things I did
56:52 - not know how to do and so I had to learn
56:54 - more JavaScript so probably I would say
56:56 - like four or five years ago I can't
56:59 - remember off the top of my head
57:00 - somewhere around there is when I really
57:01 - like made an effort to learn
57:04 - javascripts
57:05 - so I'm not like super Advanced at it I
57:11 - don't I don't think I'm super Advanced
57:13 - um and uh I will I'll you know have this
57:16 - disclaimer I don't I don't mind giving
57:18 - the disclaimer like this is my work and
57:19 - this is how I do it I'm not claiming
57:21 - that this is the best way to do it this
57:23 - is just a way I do it like this I have
57:26 - full-time job and I have clients on the
57:28 - side and I produce sites that work and I
57:31 - get paid for it and I can support my
57:33 - family with it so um is it the best way
57:37 - probably not I don't really know but it
57:40 - gets the job done and I'm I'm generally
57:43 - proud of my work uh and you know I'm I'm
57:47 - happy with the results so uh that was a
57:50 - super long answer to that
57:52 - question sorry for that um I'm still
57:56 - feel a little out of it from from the uh
57:59 - from the cold that I have so sorry for
58:01 - rambling um oh we get we got three more
58:05 - comments while I was talking all right
58:07 - I'll go through um like I said today's a
58:09 - relaxed day I worked 13 hours yesterday
58:12 - so I'll I'll take some time to go
58:14 - through these um have you used polymer
58:17 - Giovani asked how you use polymer have
58:21 - you used polymer uh I I've never used
58:24 - polymer on a site um I've looked at it
58:27 - and messed around with it a little bit
58:29 - and I'd like to learn more about it I'm
58:30 - really intrigued by it but I've just
58:32 - never had the opportunity to use it on a
58:35 - project
58:36 - yet I don't know is anybody else
58:38 - watching use polymer what do you think
58:40 - about it uh you don't have to answer now
58:41 - you can put in the comments if you want
58:43 - um but I would like to know you can
58:45 - message me um on Twitter in general all
58:47 - my Social Media stuff is up on my
58:49 - YouTube channel so whatever you guys uh
58:52 - you all are comfortable communicating
58:54 - with I'm fine with that I'm not going to
58:55 - get like Matt if you you know try to
58:58 - find me on some other social media
59:00 - channel um all my information is out
59:03 - there so there's no sense in trying to
59:06 - hide anything at this point it's already
59:07 - out there
59:09 - um but if you try to call my phone if
59:12 - you get my number I I never answer if
59:15 - it's a number I don't know so leave a
59:17 - message or else I won't

59:22 - on the internet so it's the same number
59:25 - I used when I was freelan think I have
59:26 - my own
59:27 - business um I hate the data cap couldn't
59:30 - watch any live vid oh man was there um
59:36 - uh Muhammad Ansari is talking about a
59:39 - there's a data cap in phow Indian so in
59:42 - India there's a wow I did not know that
59:44 - so evidently in India um or at least
59:48 - that part of India um there's a data cap

59:54 - wow that stinks um sorry about that I
59:57 - have a we I'm in the United States and

60:44 - people but aside from him there's really
60:46 - nobody else here that I can talk to
