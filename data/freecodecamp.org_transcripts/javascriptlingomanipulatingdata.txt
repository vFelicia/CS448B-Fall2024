00:00 - all right let's talk a little bit about
00:02 - how you actually manipulate data so
00:04 - you've got an array of information but
00:06 - you need to do something with it in
00:08 - javascript we have something called
00:09 - methods which you should look up on the
00:11 - mozilla developer network methods are
00:13 - built into the language an example of
00:15 - methods would be split
00:18 - if you do something and you split it it
00:19 - takes whatever it is and it breaks up
00:21 - into a bunch of little pieces in an
00:22 - array you don't have to write that
00:24 - function that's already built into the
00:26 - language
00:27 - you can use a lot of these methods and
00:29 - put together your own functions if you
00:31 - have a specific way that you want to
00:32 - manipulate data but it's not already
00:34 - built in as a method you can create that
00:36 - function in your javascript the main
00:38 - point of this video isn't to memorize
00:40 - what methods and functions are i just
00:42 - want you to know that there is a way
00:44 - that you can manipulate data and that
00:46 - you should really be checking if there's
00:47 - a method that already does what you want
00:49 - to do
