00:01 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:03 - jesse i'm jesse and today
00:06 - we're going to migrate some more data so
00:08 - a little while ago we had a similar
00:10 - stream
00:11 - uh so the plan is
00:15 - i have
00:16 - a spreadsheet
00:18 - and each row in the spreadsheet
00:19 - represents
00:21 - a piece of data that we'd like to
00:23 - migrate from
00:25 - a sql server database to a mysql
00:27 - database and to get from one database to
00:30 - the other
00:31 - we're using
00:32 - two tools to help us out a little node
00:35 - script
00:37 - so node.js is
00:40 - it's a way to run javascript server side
00:43 - and then we're also using the wordpress
00:46 - rest api
00:48 - to get the data the rest of the way so
00:50 - node pulls the data out of the sql
00:53 - server database and then
00:56 - the wordpress api puts the data into
01:00 - the
01:02 - my sql database i might mess that up so
01:04 - sql server to my sequel but
01:07 - um that's the plan
01:10 - i'm i'm gonna win you ahead of time it's
01:12 - not the most exciting thing in the world
01:15 - but uh i think it's a
01:19 - an okay example of
01:22 - some things that may have to happen when
01:24 - you're migrating from an old system to a
01:26 - new system and
01:28 - you can't just write one script and have
01:30 - everything come over it just doesn't
01:32 - work like that all the time
01:36 - so we're gonna have to kind of pick
01:37 - through the data try to bring it over
01:40 - and in as big a chunks as we possibly
01:42 - can but we still need to bring it over
01:45 - in a way that
01:46 - we're going to be able to make sense of
01:47 - it all and and use it
01:50 - so
01:51 - we're going to switch back and forth
01:52 - between the
01:55 - the data table we're gonna modify our
01:58 - our node script
02:00 - uh and run it
02:01 - and then we're also gonna check on this
02:04 - is a website
02:05 - uh that we're ultimately building here
02:07 - so we're going to check on the old
02:09 - version of the website
02:10 - to try to figure out like
02:12 - is this data even live do we need it
02:15 - um and if it's still there in the
02:18 - website like what's the context of this
02:20 - data to give us a better idea of
02:23 - where we should put it in the new
02:24 - database
02:27 - [Music]
02:28 - so that's the plan
02:36 - my wife is messaging me uh on my other
02:39 - screen
02:40 - and um
02:42 - she's doing some coding she's doing the
02:44 - udacity front-end nanodegree
02:47 - so she's messed she's sending me
02:49 - screenshots of her code and messaging me
02:57 - she must not know i'm streaming
03:04 - all right so let me switch over
03:07 - to my screen here you can see this is
03:09 - what i was working on
03:13 - right before i started
03:15 - let me adjust this a little bit
03:18 - okay
03:20 - um
03:22 - i'm gonna check the live chat and then
03:23 - we'll get started
03:25 - hey everyone
03:27 - um
03:35 - all right cool looks like
03:36 - you're talking about a race that
03:38 - happened uh this weekend
03:40 - um oh matthew asked if she started the
03:42 - memory project yet she's on the memory
03:44 - project right now that's the one she's
03:46 - working on
03:47 - so um
03:48 - she's working on some some click
03:50 - handlers for the cards
03:52 - and that was it actually works for her
03:55 - in codepen but not locally on her
03:58 - machine so
04:01 - anyway
04:02 - uh
04:03 - i think
04:04 - she'll probably be able to figure it out
04:06 - and
04:08 - uh
04:10 - she's been doing a pretty good job of
04:11 - getting getting through it
04:14 - okay so
04:17 - i brought over
04:19 - here let me start my pomodoro session
04:22 - i'm gonna do 25 minutes of coding in
04:25 - this case data migration and then five
04:28 - minutes a question and answer and we're
04:30 - going to go back and forth i do have a
04:33 - meeting in
04:34 - less than an hour and a half now
04:36 - so
04:38 - if we get a ton of questions i may not
04:40 - be able to answer them all
04:43 - but
04:44 - we're well within our normal time range
04:47 - here of around an hour for a stream
04:51 - uh someone asked for the website for
04:53 - this pomodoro timer so i'm going to copy
04:55 - and paste it into the chat here if you
04:57 - click it and it doesn't work then please
04:59 - try copying and pasting it
05:04 - all right
05:05 - so
05:06 - i i found some data here's the data that
05:09 - i found here i did this is really small
05:11 - i kind of need to keep it small to be
05:13 - able to see the range but i'm
05:16 - i'm just going to explain a little bit
05:18 - about what's going on here i found some
05:20 - data here that has to do with um
05:24 - residence life so like the dorm rooms on
05:27 - campus where students live and things
05:28 - like that so
05:30 - i assume you know this may be able to be
05:32 - like its own section its own post type
05:35 - in the in the wordpress and in the
05:37 - database or maybe we can just tag it in
05:40 - with with something else but i need to
05:42 - know
05:43 - what category this goes in so that's why
05:46 - i i just searched for it here
05:48 - and i could see hey this is residence
05:50 - life so let's click it
05:53 - and see all right what section does this
05:56 - fall under so it actually looks like
05:59 - uh
06:00 - this is kind of its own section it it's
06:03 - uh like a top level here
06:05 - so it's dot edu slash residence life so
06:10 - um it we may be able to put this in its
06:12 - own section
06:14 - uh just want to
06:17 - see if we have it if it's even a kind of
06:20 - a top level link here
06:24 - because i'm not sure where it's linked
06:25 - from
06:27 - um
06:33 - i'm guessing it would be student life
06:34 - where it's linked from so
06:36 - i'm clicking in here if you know i might
06:39 - be able to put it under the student life
06:42 - like in the section with all that data
06:44 - that we brought over
06:51 - residence life does that guy take us to
06:53 - the same spot
06:54 - oh it does it does
06:57 - interesting
06:59 - maybe we'll do that then
07:01 - this would be a little bit easier uh
07:03 - than making a completely new
07:05 - new post type uh so
07:07 - what we'll do is
07:09 - we already have a section for stuff like
07:12 - this under student life
07:14 - and let me let me pull up the wordpress
07:20 - did i make this
07:22 - yeah i think this is it
07:25 - all right so we have a wordpress
07:26 - installation we've been putting all this
07:28 - data into
07:30 - and we can see i will make this a bit
07:32 - bigger for you all to see
07:34 - so we have all these different data
07:36 - types
07:37 - to keep things straight for us here
07:40 - and
07:41 - we need to find the one that's student
07:43 - life
07:43 - now the users who are going to be in
07:45 - charge of editing this very few users
07:47 - are going to see all of this it's it's a
07:48 - bit much right
07:50 - so most people only see maybe one or two
07:52 - types so it'll be much cleaner easier to
07:55 - edit
07:57 - i thought i had student life stuff
07:59 - student profile pages
08:01 - where we had
08:03 - student life pages there we are
08:06 - okay so we already have a bunch of
08:07 - student life pages
08:10 - and wow we we have quite a few we have
08:13 - three pages of student life pages
08:18 - looks like these are a lot of the
08:20 - student organizations
08:22 - okay wonderful i think this will fit
08:24 - well in there
08:28 - so here's what we need to do we need a
08:29 - few pieces of of information in order to
08:32 - make this script work so we need to know
08:35 - what the folder id is that this data
08:37 - lives in
08:38 - and we also need to know what the post
08:41 - type the slug is right for so it's like
08:44 - a unique identifier for that post type
08:47 - in this case it's going to be i student
08:50 - life
08:51 - page i believe it will be
08:54 - student life
08:56 - pages
08:58 - i think that's it we'll find out if i
09:00 - run it and it doesn't work then i'll
09:02 - know that's the wrong one
09:04 - and uh we need this
09:06 - id is 486.
09:09 - so let's plug in 486
09:14 - we're going to save that uh quickly i'll
09:17 - just go over this uh basically we're
09:19 - using uh the sqlize
09:23 - to
09:24 - all right this doesn't
09:26 - we're all importing the stuff right so
09:27 - this doesn't come
09:30 - with
09:30 - um node.js by default right
09:33 - uh so we're using sqlize to help us
09:36 - interact with a sql database a little
09:38 - bit easier right and then we have our
09:42 - our sql query
09:44 - if it's a little bit different than
09:45 - you're used to uh sql has kind of
09:48 - different flavors depending on the type
09:49 - of sql database so a query for my sql
09:53 - may look slightly different than sql
09:54 - server
09:55 - but
09:56 - you can kind of figure out what's going
09:58 - on if you are familiar with sql
09:59 - basically we're just getting
10:01 - a little bit of
10:03 - we're specifying um
10:05 - what data we want
10:07 - from from where we want it so from what
10:10 - section of the database we wanted
10:13 - and this data length greater than zero
10:16 - just means i don't even want to bother
10:17 - pulling in any data that is is empty
10:20 - right it doesn't have any content at all
10:23 - right and in our case our contents html
10:25 - markup if it doesn't have markup i don't
10:27 - really want it
10:30 - and that's pretty much it then down here
10:32 - we're basically taking that data we're
10:34 - getting and we are
10:37 - creating
10:38 - posts in wordpress and then having them
10:41 - put into my sql database
10:43 - um and
10:45 - we're
10:47 - taking the the data that has a certain
10:49 - name in the mysql database and we're
10:51 - giving it a name that is more
10:53 - appropriate
10:55 - or i'm sorry in our sql server database
10:57 - we're giving it a name that's more
10:58 - appropriate for wordpress and my sequel
11:02 - and in fact i do want to get rid of this
11:07 - that was uh for a previous thing we were
11:08 - working on
11:10 - all right great that that looks uh oops
11:14 - accidentally hit a key that looks
11:16 - perfect
11:17 - let's now run this so we need to run
11:20 - um
11:24 - migrate.js
11:28 - all right it's doing something
11:30 - and let's stop that
11:32 - and we're going to check to to make sure
11:35 - that these got inserted so right now we
11:36 - have 50 items if i refresh and it's more
11:38 - than 50 then it works
11:43 - nope it didn't work
11:47 - all right so why did it not work
11:49 - probably because i put in
11:51 - the wrong
11:52 - post type
11:54 - so
11:56 - student life pages
11:59 - what did i put in wrong
12:06 - all right let's check what the post type
12:09 - is
12:12 - you know actually it may tell it may
12:14 - tell me here in the slug student life
12:16 - pages
12:17 - hmm that looks right
12:23 - so what did i do
12:25 - s-t-u-d-n-t
12:28 - live
12:29 - pages
12:32 - oh you know what i don't think it's
12:34 - plural anything it needs to be singular
12:35 - student life page
12:37 - right because each one of these is a
12:39 - post so i'm creating a new student life
12:41 - page
12:42 - that's that's the problem
12:49 - all right now let's check
12:55 - there we go now we have 67 items so we
12:57 - went from 50 to 67 that's our extra 17
13:00 - items that we just added
13:02 - okay and
13:03 - so here we go these uh this
13:07 - it's it's supposed to be short for
13:08 - assisi heights so definitely gonna
13:10 - change that title before it shows up in
13:12 - uh anyone's search
13:14 - but
13:15 - uh that's uh that's basically
13:18 - the process that we go through now
13:20 - i can go in here i have all these
13:23 - selected and i'm going to remove it from
13:25 - the table
13:26 - don't worry though i have a copy of this
13:30 - this
13:31 - spreadsheet
13:33 - in case i accidentally remove stuff that
13:34 - i shouldn't but for this one trying to
13:37 - get rid of everything as soon as we pull
13:38 - it over and that way just visually it'll
13:40 - be very easy for me to see the progress
13:43 - uh and the rows go down and down and
13:45 - down
13:47 - okay i do i see a few questions in the
13:49 - chat so
13:50 - um if if any of you are new uh please be
13:53 - patient i'll i have a timer on right now
13:56 - when the timer goes off then i will go
13:58 - back to the chat and answer your
14:00 - questions
14:01 - okay here we we have some more things
14:04 - here i'm going to try to find something
14:05 - that doesn't require me to create a
14:07 - custom post type
14:09 - ah let's see
14:12 - these look like people
14:15 - lots of people
14:16 - and
14:17 - they don't work here
14:19 - are they alumni
14:23 - are they speakers yeah i don't think
14:27 - i think these may have been speakers
14:30 - distinguished speakers series okay
14:36 - i'm not sure where i want to put that
14:39 - right now
14:40 - and i know you probably can't see how
14:42 - small this is so i'm trying to read it
14:43 - out a bit
14:46 - um
14:49 - i can delete this
14:55 - some of these are just tiny
14:57 - they're just such tiny fragments of
15:01 - pieces of data we just don't need them
15:05 - let's see
15:16 - okay these look like residence halls
15:20 - residence life staff
15:22 - [Music]
15:24 - okay um is this what contact information
15:28 - or just general information so i think
15:31 - this can go in the same spot that we
15:34 - wanted in let's just verify
15:36 - uh and see here do we have information
15:40 - about residence halls here
15:44 - residence life residence halls
15:48 - yep
15:49 - so that's where these are each one of
15:51 - these residence halls
15:52 - will have its own page and some info and
15:54 - i believe that's where this is coming
15:56 - from
16:00 - okay
16:01 - great
16:04 - uh yeah so let's take this
16:06 - and
16:08 - grab this data and
16:10 - since we're going to send it to the same
16:12 - place
16:13 - all we need to do
16:15 - is
16:18 - change that folder id so this will be
16:20 - 537 so let's go up in here
16:27 - five three seven
16:30 - we'll save it
16:34 - nothing else needs to change and we'll
16:35 - run this again
16:39 - oh 20 of them
16:41 - the more i can get in per query the
16:43 - better
16:45 - once i did a query and we got like i
16:47 - don't know around 500 at once and that
16:49 - was that was awesome
16:51 - i think that was the biggest one that
16:52 - i've done so far
16:54 - all right great so we have those uh we
16:56 - should
16:57 - i know this will work but it's always
16:59 - good to verify
17:00 - uh
17:02 - not great to just you know get ahead of
17:03 - it yep now we're up to 87 items
17:06 - wonderful
17:08 - and so now we can remove these
17:12 - let's see
17:14 - yeah we can remove these from here
17:19 - i um i was not employed here at this
17:23 - university whenever uh the old site was
17:25 - built so i'm learning so much about the
17:28 - website now as i go through and get all
17:31 - this content
17:32 - there were like whole sections that i
17:34 - didn't even know existed
17:36 - uh let's see it looks like these are
17:38 - some more
17:39 - uh this these are more information are
17:42 - these
17:44 - guys
17:51 - all right these are just image galleries
17:55 - i'm gonna bring these over
17:57 - i'm not exactly sure we'll keep them i
17:59 - know some of the older images aren't
18:01 - great quality so we may want to replace
18:03 - them but
18:04 - uh better just to bring it over
18:09 - uh and this is three
18:13 - 539 is the section
18:16 - 539
18:18 - so let's let's change that
18:20 - over here
18:22 - um
18:23 - 537.
18:25 - i brought 537
18:29 - 530 it looks like 536 could come over
18:32 - too
18:38 - i think i'll bring over 536 as well
18:42 - so let's do 539
18:45 - save that
18:47 - run it
18:51 - and i'll do 536
18:54 - as well
18:55 - save that
18:57 - run it
18:59 - wonderful
19:01 - we'll verify
19:04 - 97 items great
19:06 - now
19:08 - we can just delete all of this
19:12 - wonderful okay so this is the pattern
19:14 - this is what i i do
19:16 - when i'm on campus
19:18 - uh so usually i'm on campus two days a
19:20 - week in my office my pattern of working
19:23 - for the last few weeks has been try to
19:25 - squeeze in all my meetings into those
19:27 - two days a week so that takes up a lot
19:30 - of my time uh and then when i'm not
19:32 - doing that or taking care of like other
19:35 - tasks like paperwork and things that i
19:37 - usually only do in the office
19:40 - i'm doing this over and over again
19:43 - so
19:44 - i'm almost through
19:46 - i'm getting pretty happy about that
19:50 - so it probably doesn't really make for a
19:52 - great live stream to do this i hope you
19:54 - know i don't know maybe you get just
19:56 - kind of an appreciation for
19:58 - a way that you could handle something
20:00 - like this
20:02 - um but i'll do let me see what time it
20:05 - is
20:07 - all right so i'll do this for a few more
20:09 - minutes uh and then i'll see what kind
20:11 - of questions we have and then we'll go
20:13 - from there and you all let me know
20:16 - if you really want to see any more of
20:17 - this or you'd rather me get kind of go
20:19 - to questions keep it a shorter stream
20:22 - uh i would love
20:24 - i'd like right now to find some more
20:26 - student life things and just try to like
20:29 - chunk it together so we don't have to
20:31 - change every uh you know both pieces of
20:34 - data but
20:36 - uh
20:37 - i'm also not going to spend a bunch of
20:39 - time scrolling through here to try to
20:41 - find
20:42 - some data
20:44 - so let's see we have
20:46 - a baccalaureate 2015 image gallery
20:49 - i don't think we need that these are old
20:52 - 2015
20:53 - and uh
20:55 - 2017
20:57 - 2015. so it looks like we have some
21:00 - things in here that we just we don't
21:02 - need to
21:04 - uh bring over
21:06 - these are all old
21:08 - so let's get rid of them this is 2016
21:12 - 2016 2014.
21:15 - actually let me
21:17 - yeah these are all
21:20 - together here for sure
21:24 - commencement general info
21:26 - yeah let's get rid of that
21:30 - commencement information
21:32 - yeah i don't need that
21:34 - because that's
21:37 - oops
21:39 - there we go
21:40 - yeah
21:41 - let's delete that
21:44 - um
21:45 - these conferences
21:52 - i'm not sure if they if they want these
21:54 - conferences like the details from past
21:57 - conferences or not
22:00 - maybe i'll just leave them for now and
22:02 - i'll ask my boss about it
22:08 - okay these
22:12 - all right so i recognize some of these
22:14 - names as people that work here
22:19 - okay
22:22 - i don't really want to try to sort out
22:24 - where all these people work and get them
22:26 - in the right spots so let's just keep on
22:27 - going
22:31 - oh conspiracy theories that sounds like
22:33 - a cool course
22:36 - that's crazy that's actually a course
22:39 - um
22:41 - let me see uh it's possible
22:44 - that these courses
22:45 - what happened
22:46 - i lost it
22:48 - um
22:50 - it's possible that those courses might
22:53 - be
22:55 - old and we can get rid of them
23:01 - oh you know what these are a bunch of
23:03 - old events
23:08 - as well
23:12 - i i don't know if the theater department
23:14 - would want to keep some old events uh
23:16 - just for students prospective students
23:18 - to see
23:19 - so maybe we'll i'll ask about those as
23:22 - well
23:24 - let's see
23:39 - all right looks like i can remove some
23:41 - of these two
23:42 - this makes me happy when i can just get
23:44 - rid of stuff because we're not going to
23:46 - bring it over
23:47 - uh let's see
23:50 - four six seven yeah all of these looks
23:52 - like they are uh listings for events
23:55 - that have happened
23:57 - at least a year ago
24:01 - get rid of it all
24:05 - i'm sure it doesn't matter to you and it
24:07 - seems boring but it feels amazing when i
24:09 - can just get rid of those because that
24:10 - means i don't even i don't have to do
24:12 - anything i don't have to create post
24:14 - types i don't have to migrate the data
24:15 - like it's just like hey it's it's done
24:19 - uh okay great
24:22 - you know maybe i might make this just a
24:24 - bit bigger because i know it's going to
24:26 - be hard for you all to see and it's most
24:28 - definitely
24:30 - um difficult for me to see
24:35 - let's see if i can just make this bigger
24:38 - in bulk
24:40 - come on
24:43 - let's get a 16.
24:45 - yay that's so much bigger and
24:50 - let me get a font that i like better
24:54 - you know what we we use roboto for
24:55 - everything we may as well use it for our
24:57 - spreadsheets right
25:02 - uh okay
25:04 - cool
25:04 - a little bit better i can still see all
25:07 - the data that i need so this is fine
25:11 - um
25:12 - so here we are
25:14 - academic organizations
25:17 - student clubs
25:21 - pilgrimage
25:25 - so this 469
25:27 - looks like this could also go
25:35 - in that student life
25:37 - so let's let's pull that in
25:40 - uh
25:41 - six nine
25:45 - so 469 we're going to save that
25:48 - run it
25:51 - and verify so we're going to from 97 it
25:54 - should say 99 yep 99 awesome
25:59 - and this isn't the end of it like after
26:01 - i would do this
26:03 - i would then have to go in
26:05 - and
26:06 - make sure like
26:08 - are the titles okay you know a lot of
26:10 - the titles contain abbreviations and
26:12 - things that nobody's gonna understand so
26:14 - i gotta clean up the titles gotta make
26:16 - sure the slugs for the post types are uh
26:19 - are something that we can actually work
26:21 - with uh and fit nicely in a url
26:25 - uh sometimes one
26:27 - there'll be multiple posts and really we
26:29 - could condense it down into one so
26:31 - there's a lot of cleanup that happens as
26:33 - well afterwards
26:35 - this is just kind of the first step
26:40 - and
26:41 - let's see all right counseling
26:44 - looks like we got a nice chunk of data
26:46 - here for counseling
26:48 - health center
26:51 - all right let's do that i do you know
26:53 - what i i want to see
26:56 - counseling service i want to see what
26:58 - part of the website this is on so let's
27:00 - check the website again
27:02 - um i gotta go to the search
27:11 - i can never remember how to spell
27:12 - accounts c-o-u and s-e-l
27:20 - counseling service
27:22 - i just i don't want to get the wrong
27:24 - info because we have a counseling
27:25 - program where we teach people about
27:26 - counseling but we also have counseling
27:28 - services
27:30 - there we go wellness center
27:34 - my mother-in-law is actually a counselor
27:36 - here at the same university as i am
27:39 - counseling service is under wellness
27:42 - center
27:43 - okay
27:45 - and i bet the wellness center
27:51 - pages are under
27:55 - student life
27:58 - let's
28:00 - see is like health services
28:08 - counseling services
28:10 - yeah it's under student life so let's
28:12 - throw it let's throw it in there with
28:13 - student life
28:15 - 481
28:17 - is what we want
28:23 - 481
28:25 - and
28:26 - let's migrate it
28:28 - down the road if we ever
28:30 - you know end up seeing like wow this
28:32 - this post type
28:34 - has way too many posts in it it's huge
28:37 - we can always break it out into into
28:39 - separate ones but
28:40 - right we don't want to optimize too much
28:43 - early right it's it can be at you know
28:46 - kind of a waste of time to do it too
28:48 - early and
28:49 - it may not even be necessary
28:52 - at all you know ever so
28:55 - we want to try to avoid that
28:57 - if we can
28:59 - so let's double check we'll verify and
29:01 - my timer is almost up so we'll do some
29:03 - question and answer here in just a few
29:06 - seconds
29:08 - all right awesome so that worked and the
29:10 - last thing we want to do before we
29:11 - forget
29:13 - is remove all of these posts that were
29:16 - um
29:17 - in that
29:18 - folder with the id of 481
29:24 - all right delete
29:26 - great
29:27 - okay
29:30 - so
29:35 - i'm gonna set a five minute timer uh but
29:37 - i'm not sure i'm gonna go back and do
29:39 - another
29:40 - pomodoro session of just data migration
29:43 - you all let me know like how valuable
29:46 - this is to you i kind of i have to do
29:49 - this it's getting down like i can't put
29:51 - this off any longer i got to get the
29:52 - rest of the data in so i really need to
29:55 - make sure i get this done
29:58 - otherwise i would probably be
30:00 - streaming me doing something else maybe
30:02 - a little bit more fun
30:04 - uh so
30:06 - if you have a question please put it in
30:07 - the live chat now i just want to mention
30:09 - everyone
30:10 - uh i'm gonna go to the revolution
30:13 - conference in virginia beach
30:15 - uh later this week so i'll stream

30:21 - most likely will not be able to stream
30:23 - the rest of the week so wednesday
30:25 - thursday friday no streams
30:27 - if for some reason like maybe i can find
30:30 - some really good internet when i'm there
30:32 - then maybe i can do a stream
30:34 - but i i don't know beforehand so i can't
30:37 - really guarantee anything

32:17 - nervous and um
32:19 - like like i don't know
32:21 - nervous slash excited
32:24 - about launching the site so
32:27 - um
32:28 - that's how it's going for me
32:30 - how are you doing
32:32 - hey ann is here hey anna how's it going
32:35 - uh chris asked if i've tried out css
32:38 - grid yet i've done really minimal work
32:41 - with css grid so i don't
32:44 - honestly at this point
32:46 - my knowledge of css grade is so little
32:48 - like i i don't even want to try to
32:50 - explain anything about it to anyone yet
32:52 - because i i would probably mess it up
32:54 - but it's something i really do want to
32:56 - learn more about
32:57 - um there's so many tutorials and things
33:00 - that i'd like to do right now i just
33:01 - like since it's getting close to launch
33:04 - time for the site i'm everything is
33:06 - focused on that
33:09 - so i've i haven't even been like doing
33:11 - my usual i usually try to learn new
33:14 - things as i'm working like even if it's
33:16 - just a half hour a day but i've even cut
33:19 - that out so
33:21 - uh hopefully afterwards uh after it
33:24 - launches uh on june 4th hopefully i'll
33:27 - have a little bit more time for learning
33:33 - uh christian says jesse it is nice to
33:35 - see the real work you do also all right
33:37 - cool yeah i mean pretty much everything
33:39 - i stream is
33:40 - i mean it is things that i'm doing but
33:43 - i try to save the things that i think
33:45 - will be most exciting or uh like
33:48 - informative
33:50 - or helpful for you all uh so
33:53 - but i guess there's value in showing
33:55 - kind of like the tedious boring stuff
33:57 - sometimes too
34:00 - all right john's here
34:06 - he says hail uh of the finer repetitive
34:08 - details the doing is not so pretty the
34:11 - end product is the gem
34:13 - yeah i hope
34:18 - uh
34:19 - swadisi says good luck for that i i
34:21 - guess you're talking about my trip so
34:24 - thanks
34:25 - austin says i live in virginia beach
34:27 - come use my internet oh awesome awesome
34:30 - uh austin like if if you want
34:33 - i mean i you don't have to let me use
34:34 - your internet but if you're going to be
34:36 - in virginia beach if you're interested
34:38 - in trying like meeting up getting a
34:39 - coffee or something at some point um
34:43 - let me know uh you can i think my link
34:46 - to my twitter is in the description
34:49 - you know you can dm me if you want or
34:50 - whatever um
34:53 - you know so that that might be kind of
34:55 - cool if we could find a coffee shop that
34:57 - has decent wi-fi we might be able to
35:00 - do a little stream or something
35:03 - i don't know sometimes coffee shops
35:05 - aren't great for a stream if there's a
35:06 - lot of people the background noise is
35:08 - insane
35:09 - but um
35:10 - anyway i
35:12 - i'm down to hang out i don't know how
35:14 - much time i'll have because it will be
35:15 - conference stuff all the time but
35:18 - uh i'll i will try to work it out
35:22 - all right we have greetings from ukraine
35:25 - and you know let me grab
35:28 - uh that's in um cyrillic but i'm gonna
35:31 - use google translate
35:35 - to figure out what that is
35:43 - ivan okay so ivan says greetings from
35:46 - ukraine greetings ivan thank you and
35:48 - thanks for watching
35:50 - uh and it says any news um
35:54 - i guess if
35:55 - i'm assuming you were here when i talked
35:57 - about the conference i'm going to so i
35:59 - won't repeat that but other than that
36:03 - i don't think any news
36:04 - not really
36:06 - i i mentioned before i've been on a diet
36:09 - and i've been trying to exercise and
36:11 - that's going well i'm continuing to lose
36:13 - weight so
36:15 - i'm happy about that i have a lot more
36:17 - energy
36:20 - yeah so that's that's pretty good
36:29 - all right how many says i'm doing fine
36:31 - thanks i have started learning es6
36:34 - uh or is it still early
36:42 - um i'm not i'm not here are you asking
36:45 - me if i started learning es6 or if you
36:48 - should start learning es6 uh i guess i
36:50 - can answer both
36:53 - so i do know quite a bit of es6 uh i
36:56 - don't i don't really use all of es6 all
36:59 - the time so i
37:01 - you forget what you don't use right but
37:03 - um
37:04 - you know there are some parts of es6
37:06 - that i use
37:07 - like every day like arrow functions oh
37:09 - how memes is both of us okay cool
37:12 - yeah like i mean even especially when
37:14 - we're doing react like we're using arrow
37:16 - functions all the time uh i believe like
37:19 - map filter
37:21 - sort those things i think are es6 uh
37:24 - template literals
37:25 - love template literal syntax use that a
37:27 - lot let cons those are es6
37:30 - uh so yeah so i mean
37:33 - there is
37:34 - a good chunk of es6 that
37:37 - you know i we use all the time
37:40 - um but there are certainly some things
37:42 - that you know we don't use trying what
37:44 - else um
37:46 - object destructuring
37:49 - so i mean there's
37:51 - their thing i think it's getting to the
37:52 - point now where people
37:54 - could potentially be using es6 and not
37:57 - even realize that it's es6 because it's
37:59 - just getting so um kind of
38:02 - blended in with what people are doing
38:04 - tutorials are using it so which is good
38:06 - right
38:07 - i mean we're already on es8 es6 been
38:09 - around for a while like i i think it
38:12 - will start to get even more and more
38:14 - like normal
38:15 - browser support a lot of it now so
38:18 - um
38:21 - anyway i i love
38:23 - uh all the parts of es6 that i use
38:25 - frequently are just
38:27 - there's just very helpful
38:30 - if you're not sure what es6 is it's also
38:32 - called es2015 there are some new
38:34 - features that were added to
38:36 - the javascript language
38:38 - um way back in
38:42 - uh like 2015 i don't know exactly when
38:44 - they were added but around there and uh
38:46 - you know with with transpilers you know
38:48 - people started using them before they
38:50 - were even official um
38:52 - so
38:54 - anyway that's what we talked about when
38:56 - we're saying yes es6 and yes 2015. so if
38:59 - you want to know what those what exactly
39:01 - was added you know try searching es6 uh
39:04 - i you should be able to find something
39:07 - probably on that first page of results
39:08 - that'll go through it
39:12 - uh let's see
39:14 - phoenix says hey jesse just wanted to
39:16 - ask what average salary can a guy in
39:19 - india expect for remote work in u.s
39:21 - let's consider a full-time front-end
39:23 - developer job
39:24 - all right well that's it's going to be a
39:26 - little bit hard for me to answer that
39:28 - because
39:30 - you know certainly
39:32 - i would think like a com companies here
39:34 - in the united states
39:36 - uh when they look at
39:38 - how to to compensate a remote worker
39:41 - what they usually do at least here in
39:43 - the united states is they say okay what
39:45 - is a fair wage for where that person
39:48 - lives
39:49 - so for instance uh in the united states
39:51 - in san francisco
39:53 - cost of living is really really high
39:56 - like
39:57 - amazingly high it's just astounding to
39:59 - me how much you know uh for instance
40:01 - like houses cost out there
40:04 - so
40:05 - let's just say i'm i'm just kind of
40:07 - making these numbers up
40:08 - let's just say the average front-end
40:10 - developer in san francisco makes 150 000
40:14 - a year
40:16 - if i were to get a job with a company
40:18 - but stay where i'm at and work remotely
40:20 - even if that company's headquartered in
40:22 - san francisco they're going to look at
40:23 - my market and they're going to say wow
40:26 - um
40:27 - that's a really economically depressed
40:29 - area
40:30 - you can make a living off you know much
40:33 - les
40:34 - excuse me much it takes much less to you
40:38 - know raise a family and get a house and
40:39 - everything where i'm at so they made say
40:42 - like okay we're going to pay you 80 000
40:44 - a year
40:45 - um
40:47 - so you got to take that into
40:48 - consideration so i don't know what they
40:51 - would do they might take into account
40:53 - your standard of living
40:55 - i would imagine you could probably end
40:57 - up getting a little bit more
40:59 - um
41:00 - you know
41:01 - a company i think that's headquartered
41:03 - in an expensive area is still most
41:06 - likely going to be a bit more willing
41:09 - to pay more because they're used to
41:10 - paying more
41:12 - for you know their employees where
41:14 - they're at
41:16 - but in terms of giving a number
41:19 - i don't really know i know um
41:22 - like in in pittsburgh the closest big
41:24 - city to me is pittsburgh
41:26 - and i know in pittsburgh for um
41:30 - like uh the front end full stack um
41:34 - engineer
41:36 - you're looking at
41:38 - like minimum
41:40 - basically like i i would never take a
41:43 - job for less than like 75 000 a year in
41:47 - pittsburgh anything below that it's kind
41:49 - of like
41:50 - i just wonder if the company is really
41:52 - willing to put forth resources to make a
41:54 - good product if that's what they're
41:55 - willing they either one like have no
41:57 - idea what developers are worth
42:00 - um or
42:01 - which is bad or two
42:04 - they they don't care enough or don't
42:06 - have enough money to really put into a
42:08 - project to make it succeed
42:10 - so either way i don't really want to be
42:11 - working there uh so i my bare minimum
42:15 - would be like 75 000 a year and um
42:19 - then i would consider something like in
42:22 - the 90s would be a good offer
42:24 - uh you know so anything over 90 000
42:27 - would what i would consider to be a
42:28 - really good offer and so the kind of the
42:31 - mid-range would be between 75 and
42:34 - 90.
42:35 - uh and that's u.s dollars per year
42:41 - and if we're talking so that's
42:43 - pittsburgh if we're talking san
42:45 - francisco
42:46 - i don't know add like
42:48 - 30 000 on to
42:50 - those figures
42:52 - because it's it's much more expensive
42:58 - new york's pretty expensive uh san
43:00 - francisco as far as i know is the most
43:01 - expensive place in the u.s
43:03 - um new york's also up there as being
43:06 - pretty expensive as well
43:17 - i'm not sure how to pronounce that
43:18 - please correct me uh if i'm pronouncing
43:20 - it wrong but anyway they say hey i'm
43:23 - learning i'm new to learning node i want
43:26 - to show data from the console to web
43:28 - page using body parser but i can't
43:32 - hmm
43:35 - all right so let me check my time
43:39 - see how i can answer this
43:42 - let's tell you truth
43:44 - i'm not sure right off the bat with the
43:46 - answer the only time i use body parser
43:48 - is uh when i'm grabbing data from um an
43:52 - html form and i want to do things with
43:55 - that data in node
43:57 - um so i've never dealt with that
43:59 - specific use case
44:02 - i'm trying to uh
44:04 - i'm trying to get some resources i could
44:06 - uh maybe point you to
44:10 - i'm not sure
44:12 - if anybody in here has worked with
44:14 - something similar a node please let us
44:16 - know in the live chat
44:17 - uh otherwise i'm gonna try to keep
44:18 - thinking of it if i could think of
44:20 - something before the stream's over i
44:21 - would definitely mention it
44:25 - but like i said i i haven't dealt with a
44:27 - specific situation so i'm not i'm not
44:29 - exactly sure
44:36 - okay how many says i'm doing a course on
44:38 - udemy that focuses a lot on es6 okay so
44:41 - that was why the the other question with
44:43 - the es6
44:44 - uh it says it's called mobile web
44:46 - specialists and focuses also on service
44:48 - workers all right cool service workers
44:50 - are amazing um
44:52 - we're working with service workers in
44:54 - this project as well but a lot of it is
44:57 - set up behind the scenes already by uh
45:00 - by next js which we're using so we don't
45:02 - have to directly deal with them but it
45:05 - it a service worker can
45:08 - sit between the client and the server
45:11 - and intercept network data and
45:15 - do things with it so
45:17 - it could essentially
45:18 - it could cache data
45:20 - and then the client
45:23 - uh client's network call goes out like
45:24 - normal but it doesn't go any further
45:26 - because the service worker will say oh
45:28 - they want this data we already have a
45:29 - cache just send it back
45:31 - and then you have like zero second load
45:33 - times because the data is right there
45:35 - because the service worker actually
45:36 - lives in the browser
45:38 - right
45:39 - so it doesn't have to go anywhere it
45:40 - doesn't even have to leave the browser
45:42 - so really cool
45:43 - um really cool things you can also do
45:45 - things like um calculations that would
45:48 - normally like crush uh your
45:51 - uh performance like in the dom you know
45:53 - scrolling and if you make everything all
45:55 - janky you could offload it to a service
45:57 - worker do all the calculations there and
46:00 - not uh mess up
46:02 - uh you know your flow
46:04 - um basically it wouldn't render block at
46:07 - all it wouldn't block the normal stuff
46:09 - that needs to happen on the page
46:11 - so that would that'd be pretty cool if
46:13 - you were going to do like i don't know
46:14 - like image processing somebody uploads
46:16 - an image you want to do some really like
46:19 - uh intense intent uh resource intensive
46:22 - things to it
46:23 - uh handle that in a service worker and
46:25 - then the user can still scroll around
46:27 - your page
46:28 - while that's doing its thing
46:35 - okay nikki says es6 is the language
46:38 - itself now meaning javascript
46:40 - it's in the official spec when learning
46:42 - javascript you also learn es6 now
46:44 - automatically unless you're learning old
46:46 - material okay that's that's pretty cool
46:48 - i didn't even think about that but yeah
46:49 - i mean when i went through the basic
46:51 - tutorials of javascript
46:53 - es6 was still
46:55 - um well early on it wasn't out yet and
46:58 - then later on it was still really kind
47:00 - of new so you didn't it just wasn't
47:01 - there
47:03 - uh but that's cool that it's a part of
47:05 - the tutorials now i mean that's i think
47:07 - as it should be right because there are
47:09 - some things that were a lot harder to do
47:11 - before es6
47:12 - uh and i
47:14 - i don't see that much value in making a
47:16 - new
47:17 - uh you know learner
47:19 - do it the harder way when
47:22 - you know not even the advanced people
47:23 - are doing it like that anymore uh so
47:26 - yeah i i think that's good that they're
47:28 - teaching it like that
47:33 - um
47:35 - ivan says
47:37 - asks if i'm using something else other
47:39 - than react in the front end
47:41 - or if i now i mean
47:43 - i've been using react for most of the
47:45 - projects uh it's it's not that i have
47:47 - anything against the other stuff it's
47:49 - just um
47:52 - i'm kind of taking the approach right
47:53 - now that i'd rather get really good at
47:55 - one thing than try to know a little bit
47:57 - about all the things
47:59 - um
48:00 - so i i have to give up on some things
48:03 - that i think are really cool
48:05 - but it's it's for the sake of trying to
48:07 - make ultimately a better product so i've
48:10 - chosen react
48:11 - and so for the time being i'm pretty
48:13 - much just building things in react and
48:16 - if i'm not using react that means it's
48:18 - simple enough that i can just build it
48:19 - with just plain javascript
48:21 - um
48:24 - yeah so that's where i'm at right now
48:26 - we do have some other videos on the free
48:28 - code camp channel using things like vue
48:30 - and angular so
48:31 - you could check the the backlog of
48:33 - videos and uh and see some other things
48:35 - as well
48:37 - so we're not
48:38 - we're not like just just react but for
48:41 - me personally i'm
48:43 - using a lot of react
48:49 - i've been asked if i'm the creator of
48:51 - free code camp no uh so quincy
48:54 - uh i y'all know i don't know if you all
48:56 - know quincy um so quincy created uh
49:00 - free code camp he is the founder and he
49:03 - is um
49:05 - the i don't know what is his title
49:07 - president
49:08 - i'm not
49:09 - let me look him up on twitter
49:14 - to see what his title is because i'm not
49:16 - sure
49:19 - quincy's so humble his twitter says
49:22 - teacher at free code cam he's in charge
49:24 - of it all so
49:26 - um anyway
49:27 - quincy larson uh is
49:30 - who you want so if you want to follow
49:32 - him on twitter it's at aussia o-s-s-i-a
49:37 - uh anyway he's very very awesome guy
49:40 - um so yeah he's the one that started i
49:44 - my involvement with free code camp is
49:46 - pretty limited to these live streams on
49:48 - youtube i've talked with some of the
49:50 - other people from free code camp and had
49:52 - some like video chats and things but
49:55 - uh there are a ton of other people that
49:57 - work on various areas of free code camp
50:01 - so
50:03 - uh there's a lot of people behind the
50:05 - scenes that nobody even knows about that
50:06 - are making this happen and uh
50:09 - working for free too i mean
50:11 - almost all the stuff that gets done on
50:13 - free code camp is is from volunteer time
50:20 - let's see
50:25 - um
50:27 - ed
50:28 - edison so edi cson says
50:32 - hi there i'm 28 am i too old to be a
50:35 - programmer what do you think
50:37 - uh no definitely not too old uh
50:40 - not so you're never too old to be a
50:42 - programmer i've seen stories of people a
50:45 - lot older switching careers
50:48 - learning how to become a programmer and
50:50 - get having successful programming
50:52 - careers so i am 32 years old
50:56 - uh i taught high school for for a little
50:59 - while in my mid-20s and um
51:02 - then i switched into programming in my
51:04 - late 20s
51:06 - so i had i learned a little bit before
51:09 - that but i really kind of got serious
51:11 - about it and switched into it late 20s
51:13 - and i'm employed now as a full-time
51:15 - front-end developer uh i i don't know
51:17 - how successful you would consider me but
51:20 - i make enough money to support my family
51:22 - and pay my bills
51:24 - uh so
51:26 - um i mean i have four kids i have a wife
51:29 - so i i'd
51:30 - say that's uh
51:32 - you know it's pretty successful right i
51:34 - mean i'm not um
51:37 - not making millions or anything but
51:40 - i certainly can support myself and my
51:42 - family
51:44 - so yeah 28
51:46 - definitely not too old
51:52 - let's see
51:54 - uh mert says hi
51:56 - says i love free code cam awesome
51:59 - awesome thank you i love it too
52:01 - that's why i do this stuff uh so i mean
52:04 - i do have my own youtube channel i do
52:06 - some videos on there but as you all know
52:08 - like the
52:09 - the majority of my hours spent doing
52:11 - youtube software are spent with free
52:12 - code camp
52:14 - um
52:15 - so i think it's i think it's something
52:16 - special i think it helps people
52:20 - uh edison says i studied three years in
52:22 - my country but then i came to the us and
52:24 - i had been working uh
52:27 - as a barber
52:28 - uh i love these two professions
52:31 - oh cool i have a lot of family members
52:33 - that are are barbers and hairdressers
52:35 - actually so i've got
52:38 - one uncle two great uncles
52:41 - and
52:42 - two cousins
52:44 - first cousins that are all
52:47 - barbers or and or hairdressers so
52:51 - uh
52:52 - definitely appreciate uh what it takes
52:55 - to do that job
52:58 - all right
52:59 - uh francis says
53:02 - have you tried php what can you say
53:04 - about it i have tried php uh and for
53:08 - this project in particular i've done a
53:10 - little php so all those custom post
53:12 - types you saw in in wordpress i created
53:15 - a plugin in php
53:17 - that
53:18 - creates those and some custom taxonomies
53:20 - as well
53:22 - so
53:23 - i
53:24 - i don't have a lot to say about php
53:27 - i can do a little bit when i need to in
53:29 - php it's not my preferred language
53:31 - but i mean like any language i think
53:34 - whatever language you work with the most
53:36 - is usually the one you're most
53:37 - comfortable with so i'm not that
53:39 - comfortable with it because i don't do
53:40 - that much um and i think you know from
53:43 - most languages can do most things right
53:46 - uh most your major languages so
53:49 - um it seems like the strengths and
53:50 - weaknesses of those languages are mostly
53:53 - felt kind of at the extremes uh where
53:56 - like you really need performance uh and
53:59 - then you you could start to see some
54:01 - differences
54:02 - um
54:04 - but for most things
54:06 - i think you know php is
54:08 - is as good as
54:10 - you know as good as anything else
54:12 - for me personally if i was getting into
54:14 - web development which i am in it now but
54:17 - you know if i was trying to pick you
54:18 - know as a beginner and trying to pick
54:19 - what to learn i personally would go with
54:22 - full stack javascript because my view on
54:24 - it is you only have so many
54:27 - you know hours in the day to learn
54:29 - um
54:31 - why not learn one language and be able
54:33 - to do two things with it right front end
54:35 - and back end
54:36 - then learn two different languages and
54:38 - since you got to know javascript for web
54:40 - development anyway
54:41 - why not just stick with it so and that's
54:43 - nothing against php
54:45 - uh it's just kind of a being really
54:48 - practical about it and trying to be as
54:50 - efficient as possible with my learning
54:53 - but if you do want to work with anything
54:55 - like wordpress which a ton of websites
54:57 - run on wordpress so there's definitely a
54:59 - market there
55:00 - then you're probably going to want to
55:01 - know php because that's what it's built
55:03 - on uh also if you want to work on drupal
55:06 - or joomla which are
55:09 - not as popular as wordpress but you
55:11 - still see them a lot uh those also run
55:14 - off php so it's definitely still
55:16 - valuable
55:17 - to learn
55:21 - let's see
55:26 - lawrence says uh do you know scratch and
55:29 - is it good oh yeah scratch um for those
55:32 - who don't know scratches it's like a
55:34 - visual programming language i believe it
55:37 - was developed at mit uh
55:40 - mainly to help teach kids programming so
55:43 - you have these tiny little colored
55:45 - blocks that represent different actions
55:47 - you can take in code so you have one for
55:49 - like a for loop
55:51 - um you have ones that represent
55:53 - variables um like iterators like you
55:56 - know different basic things uh while
55:58 - loops and you just
56:00 - click and drag the blocks over to where
56:03 - your code lives
56:05 - and um so you build the code like that
56:07 - instead of typing it out you click and
56:09 - drag these different colors so it's it's
56:11 - kind of easier for kids with little
56:13 - fingers you know and not quite uh don't
56:17 - really have the dexterity yet for a lot
56:18 - of typing
56:20 - um
56:21 - or the spelling skills really can still
56:24 - make some cool things in scratch and um
56:27 - there have been some people to do some
56:28 - pretty advanced things in scratch like
56:31 - usually like games and things
56:34 - so it's um
56:36 - i mean i i wouldn't do
56:38 - like a real project in scratch for a
56:41 - client or anything
56:42 - it's not a programming language like
56:44 - that but
56:45 - it's it's just another layer of
56:47 - abstraction uh geared towards making
56:50 - programming easier for
56:52 - uh for children so uh if you're just
56:55 - starting out
56:56 - starting with scratch is not a bad idea
56:59 - even if you're older
57:01 - i know harvard's computer science 50
57:03 - course starts you out in scratch the
57:05 - first assignment for that course
57:08 - is scratch and that course is geared
57:09 - towards people who are 18
57:12 - 19 20 like around that age range so
57:15 - um
57:17 - scratch is just a cool place to start to
57:19 - get an understanding of what are loops
57:21 - what are if statements and things like
57:23 - that
57:24 - without having to get having to get
57:25 - bogged down by all this syntax right so
57:29 - definitely awesome for kids but also
57:30 - awesome for adults who are just starting
57:33 - out in programming
57:35 - and it's just kind of fun right it's
57:37 - like if you just want to mess around and
57:38 - do something scratch is fun
57:48 - hammy says
57:49 - it's really good to see these people
57:51 - with different cultures gathered
57:52 - together by enthusiasm for coding
57:55 - um
57:56 - yeah definitely definitely i i know i'm
57:59 - i've talked about this before i'm sure
58:00 - but
58:01 - uh i think
58:03 - i think that there's really something
58:05 - special going on here with free code
58:07 - camp and with these live streams um
58:11 - in that
58:12 - like there's there's a community that's
58:14 - grown so like not everybody attends
58:17 - every live stream and that's fine
58:18 - because everybody has their own lives
58:20 - and priorities and i you know that's
58:22 - that's totally fine but like
58:24 - you know in general
58:26 - there's quite there are quite a few
58:28 - people who are regulars you know who you
58:30 - see
58:30 - you know from time to time in here that
58:32 - start to know each other that even start
58:34 - to work on projects together outside of
58:37 - this live stream
58:39 - that help each other out
58:41 - and
58:43 - that's awesome you know people have come
58:45 - into the chat and watched the streams
58:47 - and
58:48 - just been learning
58:49 - and then they've gone on interviews and
58:52 - then they've gotten job offers and
58:53 - started working and have kind of checked
58:56 - in throughout this whole process and
58:58 - updated us in in the chat so
59:01 - um
59:02 - i think that's cool people have shared
59:04 - like i i know i share a lot of my
59:05 - struggles with um
59:08 - uh with mental health and you know even
59:10 - physical health and things uh and i know
59:12 - some of you have shared as well so i
59:15 - and i know there are people from
59:16 - everywhere um
59:18 - a lot of different countries different
59:20 - cultures different uh religions
59:22 - different you know
59:24 - everything that you can be that's
59:25 - different
59:27 - from each other i i think we've seen it
59:29 - here and we all get along i mean i
59:32 - i almost never have to block someone or
59:36 - delete a comment or anything i i think
59:38 - it's
59:40 - i think it's amazing right there's a lot
59:41 - of haters on the internet and a lot of
59:43 - trolls but they don't they're not here
59:46 - they're not here they're good people
59:47 - here you are good people so um i
59:50 - appreciate that and it makes me want to
59:52 - keep doing this uh it makes me want to
59:54 - learn more so that this is useful for
59:56 - you all
59:57 - uh and and i can keep doing this so
60:02 - anyway
60:03 - anyway i'll keep going i'm not gonna
60:04 - dwell on it too much i just i i really
60:07 - appreciate this this community
60:13 - let's see
60:15 - um
60:18 - leandro says hi i'm uh from brazil i
60:21 - love free code cam awesome
60:23 - awesome
60:24 - uh that's cool they said free code camp
60:27 - is a huge thing we're doing a lot of
60:29 - stuff i'm just a very small part of that
60:35 - santiago says
60:37 - greetings from venezuela
60:39 - awesome
60:41 - thanks for watching
60:46 - my mommy says in the field of coding the
60:48 - journey of knowledge just never ends so
60:51 - true that's what i love about it
60:56 - uh phoenix says also uh you know
60:58 - right that hayley jones uh on twitter
61:01 - will put up her portfolio tomorrow oh
61:04 - okay awesome yeah i do i follow haley
61:06 - jones on twitter so
61:08 - really cool
61:13 - uh lauren says thanks for the answer but
61:15 - scratch is a good way to begin uh
61:19 - but is scratch a good way to begin
61:21 - javascript because uh i do it for two
61:23 - years now i don't really know
61:26 - two years i'm not sure if that's years
61:28 - or not but
61:29 - i don't really know how to go from
61:31 - scratch to java i did download
61:33 - grasshopper the new learn app i haven't
61:35 - had a chance to
61:37 - try grasshopper yet and
61:39 - by grasshopper that is the new app from
61:42 - google that helps you learn javascript
61:43 - correct
61:44 - um somebody let me know if i'm wrong on
61:46 - that uh
61:48 - i haven't tried it yet like i mentioned
61:50 - earlier i've just been kind of
61:52 - um
61:54 - in in rush mode here for this website
61:56 - launch so i haven't done anything on the
61:59 - side but i'd love to try it i think i've
62:01 - heard a lot of good things about it
62:02 - though so i think that may be a good way
62:04 - to go
62:06 - to get into javascript also
62:08 - you go through the free code camp
62:09 - curriculum so if you go to
62:11 - freecodecamp.org and you start it on
62:13 - that it'll start you out with html and
62:14 - css but
62:16 - then it'll ease you into javascript so
62:19 - that's a great way to learn as well it's
62:20 - not the only resource there are a lot of
62:22 - other resources out there but
62:24 - it's one that i myself went through i
62:26 - didn't finish all the free code camp but
62:28 - i did go through
62:29 - a bit of it and it definitely helped
62:34 - um
62:35 - lauren says uh i'm from belgium awesome
62:39 - awesome nikki's in belgium too
62:42 - uh great
