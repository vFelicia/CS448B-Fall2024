00:00 - we've seen that with like design Trends
00:02 - all these startups now have websites
00:03 - that look the same but you know I think
00:06 - that we've become so practically
00:08 - oriented that we've kind of lost touch
00:10 - of that kind of creative angle and
00:37 - welcome back to the freec Cod Camp
00:39 - podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and
00:42 - founder of freecodecamp.org where each
00:45 - week we're bringing you Insight from
00:46 - developers Founders and ambitious people
00:49 - getting into Tech this week we're joined
00:52 - by Kobe fok he's a developer experienc
00:55 - engineer and a prolific teacher who has
00:59 - created 60 tutorials for free C Camp
01:01 - over the years and he's published 176
01:04 - tutorials on his own YouTube channel all
01:08 - freely available this man is a
01:10 - Wellspring of developer wisdom Kobe
01:14 - welcome to the show hey thanks for
01:15 - having me I've been super excited for
01:17 - this yeah man like you are somebody in
01:20 - the community who's just like a main
01:21 - State you're like you're always there
01:23 - you're like the Energizer Bunny you
01:24 - never burn out you're always creating
01:27 - and uh it's it's like such a breath of
01:29 - fresh air to have somebody who's just
01:31 - like a super chill you know Dad who who
01:35 - goes out and like creates tutorials and
01:38 - I've never seen you in a bad mood either

01:45 - me when I'm angry yeah yeah well dude uh
01:48 - it's so cool to have you here and I want
01:51 - I want to learn more about you because I
01:52 - interact with you all the time and yet I
01:54 - know so little um so maybe you can share
01:58 - some of your uh Journey with us and we
02:01 - can go way back to maybe your formative
02:04 - moments like at what point did you first
02:07 - start getting interested in technology
02:09 - and design and just creating yeah so
02:12 - I've I've always just generally been
02:14 - interested in technology uh my dad was
02:16 - that way my brothers were that way I
02:18 - still remember sitting back behind my
02:20 - brothers playing like Warcraft 1 and uh
02:23 - all those kind of games on the older
02:25 - computers and just watching them with
02:26 - you know amazed um eventually getting
02:29 - into to playing those games myself you
02:32 - know playing Warcraft 3 and
02:33 - Counterstrike in high school and all
02:34 - that stuff but um from a code
02:37 - perspective and actually starting to
02:39 - play with the technology I still
02:40 - remember in Middle School sitting in a
02:42 - classroom my buddy broke out this HTML
02:45 - book that he got from his brother and we
02:46 - were trying to make all these different
02:48 - websites this is I think in the uh Angel
02:51 - Fire uh era where Angel Fire was like
02:54 - kind of like a self-hosted website like
02:57 - like you could just go in and customize
02:59 - it was like geoc City
03:00 - yeah like go cities and like you the
03:02 - crazy backgrounds with the floating text
03:04 - on top of the stuff and I just remember
03:06 - having a lot of fun doing that yeah yeah
03:10 - and a lot of people have started with
03:12 - like Neopets um of course Myspace you
03:15 - could you used to be able to use like
03:16 - HTML CSS to customize Mike space Mark
03:19 - Zuckerberg rolled in up in as the fun
03:21 - police nope you can't have any fun every
03:23 - page has to look like a boring Facebook
03:25 - page if you're on Facebook right but
03:27 - before that there was this Cambrian
03:29 - explosion of creativity uh people doing
03:31 - all kinds of things to customize their
03:33 - profiles and to build you know their you
03:35 - know Buffy the Vampire Slayer fanfic
03:37 - pages and like all this stuff right um
03:40 - yeah and you were part of that era uh
03:44 - you were growing up during the uh kind
03:46 - of like web the the Renaissance Era when
03:50 - is it considered a Renaissance when it's
03:51 - like the first time it
03:53 - happen but but just you know there were
03:55 - no rules right yeah people didn't think
03:58 - about accessibility they didn't think
03:59 - about like you know whether like some
04:01 - pattern on their um their website could
04:04 - induce you know epileptic seizures they
04:05 - didn't think about um you know
04:08 - localization or or how long it would
04:10 - take for the page to load or anything
04:12 - like that they had these crazy
04:13 - ostentatious Splash Pages it was it was
04:16 - a different world right yeah and it's
04:18 - funny you mention Myspace because I
04:20 - think that's kind of when I started
04:21 - getting slightly more serious about just
04:23 - playing with code because because of the
04:25 - ability to create and customize like I
04:28 - learned so much HTML and CS s by fitting
04:30 - that into their little text box to
04:32 - Overlay complete custom profiles and
04:35 - even making a few dollars out of it uh
04:37 - during that time but um I I spent so
04:40 - much time creating them and it's just
04:41 - amazing what you can learn with like CSS
04:44 - by being able to do that so you you were
04:46 - able to uh you know make some money
04:48 - helping other people set up their
04:50 - profiles yeah yeah yeah so like uh bands
04:52 - like I would create a band website and
04:53 - they would want their Myspace profile to
04:55 - look really nice right so uh I would
04:57 - charge them additionally to create a
04:59 - basically a custom web page for Myspace
05:02 - but uh because the way that it works it
05:03 - hooks into like you know the little mini
05:05 - player that used to be on there their
05:06 - profile picture so it's basically like
05:08 - creating a really Advanced template for
05:10 - a mypace profile yeah that's pretty
05:14 - that's pretty good work if you can find
05:15 - it like just being able to help local
05:17 - bands uh and and get get to apply your
05:20 - design chops and I don't want to jump
05:22 - too far ahead because I do want to take
05:25 - in those juicy like early years
05:27 - experiences of you unlocking different
05:30 - aspects of you know what was what is
05:32 - ultimately become KOB fok but uh but
05:37 - clearly like you did study design in
05:40 - school and and so would you describe
05:42 - that as like an early passion of yours
05:44 - Art and Design for sure I've always been
05:46 - interested in like the whole graphic
05:48 - design angle um just designing my own
05:51 - things uh I I always all the work that I
05:54 - did was always both design and
05:55 - development and you know when I was in
05:57 - high school I didn't like I had had a
05:59 - lot of fun uh and I was really engaged
06:02 - with coding things but I never really
06:04 - kind of took it seriously so when I went
06:06 - to go to school and I don't think there
06:08 - was really much curriculum around uh uh
06:11 - College curriculum around uh coding at
06:13 - that time or web web design and web
06:16 - coding at that time so um there wasn't
06:18 - really I didn't feel like there was
06:19 - really a path for that so uh deciding
06:21 - what I want to do I really enjoyed
06:23 - design so I want to try to go for
06:25 - graphic design um ultimately I like
06:28 - during that time I was coding the entire
06:30 - time on the side whether it's rebuilding
06:33 - my portfolio every year for my design
06:35 - work uh or trying to do like a WordPress
06:37 - site for somebody um but it was really
06:39 - just a side passion of mine the entire
06:41 - time and uh trying to make it through
06:43 - the the design
06:45 - program yeah and let's talk about design
06:48 - school because like a lot of people will
06:51 - not have the luxury of going to design
06:53 - school because like things are becoming
06:55 - so competitive that I just tell people
06:57 - like go study computer science like yeah
06:59 - uh like I I genuinely my advice to
07:01 - pretty much everybody in 2024 is like if
07:04 - you're G to go get a degree get a degree
07:06 - in computer science just because you're
07:08 - definitely going to use that like
07:10 - employers are definitely going to you
07:12 - respond positively to you having a CS
07:14 - degree uh but what was design school
07:17 - like um you know we've had people on on
07:19 - the podcast who went to like art school
07:21 - and we talked about art school
07:22 - confidential like the comic book and
07:24 - stuff like have you ever read Art School
07:25 - Confidential no no okay so uh Daniel
07:29 - Chloe I think he did like Ghost World
07:31 - and a bunch of cool uh graphic novels in
07:33 - the early 2000s late 90s um but but his
07:36 - experience going to art school where
07:38 - when you went to design school you went
07:40 - to a really good school you went to Penn
07:41 - State right
07:43 - um what was it like like what kind of
07:45 - things did you learn in school yeah so
07:47 - interesting enough like Penn State isn't
07:49 - like your traditional art school right
07:51 - but like they had this small art program
07:54 - or design program inside of it um and
07:56 - they only accepted so the first two
07:59 - years I was part of that design program
08:01 - but then after that they narrowed it
08:03 - down for the final two years to a group
08:05 - I didn't make that group to be honest uh
08:07 - because they only accepted 19 out of the
08:10 - 69 or so uh people that were inside of
08:13 - the actual program itself um which
08:16 - considering the size of the school is
08:17 - pretty small right yeah um but through
08:20 - those first two years I learned so much
08:22 - for like typography and um like Design
08:25 - Systems and um illustration and uh
08:30 - illustration through like illustrator
08:31 - not uh not by I I cannot draw for the
08:34 - life of me um but you know trying to
08:36 - really think about the design
08:37 - fundamentals from a graphic design
08:40 - perspective and it really had nothing to
08:42 - do with web design or anything like that
08:45 - but I feel like I was able to take a lot
08:47 - of the lessons that I learned and apply
08:48 - it throughout my time uh whether it's
08:51 - designing UI uh from more of a uex
08:53 - perspective or uh just trying to be a
08:55 - little bit more creative with how I um
08:58 - display typography on a page or
08:59 - something like that yeah and I've talked
09:01 - with several people um on the show uh
09:04 - who studied graphic design um and even
09:07 - uh Allison uh Allison Yun studied like
09:11 - fashion design uh and I've talked with
09:12 - people that went like architectural
09:14 - architect School essentially like and
09:17 - one of the definite like commonalities
09:20 - that I picked up is that like design is
09:23 - kind of like you have to apply
09:26 - Aesthetics and you have to it's not
09:28 - enough to to make some interesting brush
09:30 - Strokes on a canvas or to mold something
09:33 - out of uh bronze or or clay or something
09:35 - like that but you it has to have some
09:36 - practical I guess underlying business
09:39 - value right it has to do something yeah
09:42 - and like I thinking about it from an
09:43 - engineering perspective like you're
09:45 - solving a problem so graphic design
09:47 - isn't just uh and I think that's where
09:49 - it kind of in my opinion kind of
09:52 - differentiates itself from traditional
09:53 - art is that it's very problem focused
09:56 - where you're solving a problem with
09:58 - those designs as opposed to to uh
10:00 - expressing yourself right when I create
10:02 - uh my designs like it's solving that
10:05 - specific problem whether it's trying to
10:06 - Market a particular product for for an
10:08 - e-commerce store or whatever that may be
10:10 - yeah and um we're definitely going to
10:14 - get more into what kind of problems
10:16 - you've been solving over the many years
10:18 - of your career but were there any like
10:21 - really formative kind of like
10:23 - experiences in college like you're
10:25 - already getting this uh this bachelor's
10:28 - degree in design and graphic design
10:29 - design as a field is kind of waning in
10:32 - its importance like magazines are
10:34 - becoming
10:35 - discontinued um newspapers like like
10:38 - print graphic generally is focused on
10:41 - like print and then there's like web
10:43 - design or or it's called visual design
10:45 - is kind of like the the Webby version of
10:48 - that or or the uh I guess interactive
10:50 - design and stuff like that yeah uh did
10:52 - you at any point feel like hey some of
10:54 - the stuff I'm learning like may not be
10:57 - that useful like we were you like
10:59 - thinking about like what your jobs were
11:01 - going to be like where did you decide to
11:04 - further tool up your your already
11:06 - existing web design skills because as
11:08 - you said you were already doing some
11:09 - client work for bands and stuff like
11:11 - that but like like maybe you can talk
11:12 - about that journey into I need to get
11:14 - more serious about code yeah so I don't
11:17 - think there was anything specifically
11:19 - that made me feel that because of my
11:22 - career path that I needed to focus more
11:24 - on code it was always just a passion
11:27 - inside project and again like building
11:29 - my these projects on the side I never I
11:32 - still I don't think in college ever
11:34 - considered that that would be something
11:35 - I would ever do full-time I think it was
11:37 - just this this medium that I was using
11:40 - to uh showcase my portfolio to help
11:44 - clients uh but where I would be focused
11:47 - focused on the design that they can then
11:48 - put on the website as opposed to the
11:50 - website that they can put the design you
11:52 - know what I mean by that like try to
11:53 - think of it from a different perspective
11:55 - um but I think one of the things that
11:57 - was interesting is how I was able able
11:59 - to apply that design um and the last two
12:01 - years I spent on learning photography as
12:03 - well and really take those lessons and
12:05 - apply them to uh crafting experiences on
12:08 - the web um so I think back to like when
12:11 - I worked at think eek like it's an
12:12 - e-commerce store and uh having to um
12:16 - think about how the products are going
12:17 - to actually fit on the product pages for
12:19 - instance and um working with the
12:21 - creative team to uh get their
12:23 - photography uh onto the site and uh
12:25 - those kind of things and it really I
12:28 - think it helped me think a little bit
12:29 - differently for how I was able to build
12:30 - those pages and and experiences yeah and
12:34 - when did you start working at Think Geek
12:36 - cuz Think Geek for people who don't know
12:38 - was this it was The Sharper Image for
12:41 - sis edms it was all like nerdy jokes and
12:43 - stuff like that like like half the stuff
12:45 - you saw in like Big Bang Theory it' be
12:47 - like purchasable it was amazing yeah
12:50 - yeah and they they just had this a lot
12:52 - of weird inside gags a lot of things
12:54 - You' probably buy and then you'd like
12:55 - regret like okay that was funny but now
12:57 - I own this weird object totally totally
13:00 - like a pet rock right yeah yeah it's it
13:03 - seems like a good idea at the time but
13:05 - then you're like man my wallet um so man
13:09 - I want to learn more about Think Geek
13:10 - what was it like how long were you there
13:12 - man uh I was at Think Geek for three
13:14 - years and I I still look back at it as
13:17 - one of my one of the top career uh one
13:21 - of the most fun times I've had in my
13:22 - career um is the culture itself was just
13:26 - amazing like everybody there everybody
13:28 - were Geeks like like we were all
13:30 - enjoying the same thing and uh everybody
13:32 - felt passionate about helping other
13:34 - Geeks and not only other Geeks but uh
13:37 - bringing Joy to the World because
13:39 - there's countless times where we would
13:41 - send uh um products to some kid that was
13:46 - having a hard time or going through a
13:48 - rough time in life and being able to see
13:50 - that joy that we were able to indirectly
13:53 - help them bring it was just really
13:55 - magical experience so um just you know I
13:58 - I miss those times dearly and the team
14:00 - that I was working with uh my buddies
14:02 - there um it's just a completely
14:04 - different experience that I miss but
14:06 - yeah and was that your first job out of
14:08 - college or no so I had two two others
14:13 - two and a half because one was parttime
14:14 - so yeah uh right out of college I
14:16 - started at an e- marketing company
14:18 - startup uh called Snap retail that was
14:21 - pretty much just designing banners for
14:23 - their website and if you kind of like
14:25 - look into that so I wasn't doing too
14:27 - much coding but I was designing the
14:28 - graphics for the people who would code
14:31 - it up right um eventually I would do a
14:32 - little bit of code but then just to get
14:35 - my first full-time job I actually kind
14:37 - of went back to a full-time design job
14:39 - where I was designing uh wraps for
14:43 - tractor trailers and cars so you know
14:45 - there's big graphics on the
14:49 - side like with all the dead bugs yeah
14:51 - exactly exactly or or if you've seen The
14:53 - Big Bang Theory or not the Big Bang
14:56 - Theory uh we just talked about that uh
14:57 - the Silicon Valley like the the one guy
15:00 - has like his startup name he wraps his
15:03 - like you
15:04 - know Dad mobile thing it's like just a
15:08 - logo all over it it's like his his viral
15:10 - marketing or his Gorilla Marketing like
15:12 - everywhere I drive people are seeing my
15:14 - startup name yeah and like that was that
15:17 - was a huge learning experience like it
15:18 - was a lot of fun because I had a lot of
15:20 - freedom like that I was able to do um
15:22 - but also like it was a completely
15:23 - different format that you never think
15:24 - about so trying to solve the problems of
15:26 - that from a design perspective was
15:28 - really interesting yeah I guess
15:29 - interesting Dimensions too like like
15:31 - like how big can this graphic be like
15:33 - you have to have room for the wheel well
15:34 - you know lot of math because we would we
15:37 - would be given these little templates
15:38 - that were at scale and we' have to
15:41 - design on those little templates and
15:43 - those get blown up and then print it out
15:46 - and like you can make a little bit of an
15:47 - error and then it completely ruins the
15:49 - rapping team's job and that's HP that
15:51 - happened a few times unfortunately but
15:53 - it was it was an interesting learning
15:55 - experience yeah wow man uh I guess if I
15:59 - had infinity money I just wrap my car in
16:01 - like free C Camp since I like I'm kind
16:03 - of like a walking free Coke Camp
16:04 - billboard all the
16:06 - time just get like the the checkered the
16:09 - checkered logo all all over the car I
16:11 - might be at like a stoplight people like
16:13 - hey what happened to my
16:16 - account I can't claim the certification
16:19 - you know like no sorry I got my kids are
16:21 - in the back said I need little support
16:23 - yeah yeah maybe that's not a great
16:27 - idea that's that's interesting you're
16:29 - the first person I've ever talked to who
16:31 - has designed like truck CBS yeah yeah
16:34 - and like it's it was such an interesting
16:37 - because I never would have thought that
16:38 - I'd be designing for trucks and cars and
16:40 - that kind of stuff but like I had a lot
16:42 - of fun with it you know sometimes they
16:44 - would send the art and it was like a
16:45 - corporate thing that I needed to put on
16:46 - the side a logo or something but other
16:48 - times I was given complete Freedom like
16:51 - was it like Regal movie or this one
16:53 - movie theater that I needed to create a
16:55 - design for and I was able to take all
16:56 - the like characters from candy that they
16:58 - had and put candy in the background and
17:00 - I was able to create this really cool
17:01 - looking uh thing ultimately it wasn't
17:03 - used but a a beer company one I did was
17:05 - used but um it if you got that candy WP
17:08 - thing if you still have any of that
17:09 - around okay yeah yeah I'll I'll add a
17:12 - link to the show not so you can see what
17:14 - that concept for a movie theater candy
17:16 - truck wrap what it looks like because I
17:19 - mean it never saw the light of the day
17:20 - but at least we can shine some light on
17:22 - it enjoy it because it sounds like you
17:23 - did a lot of work on it yeah it was a
17:25 - lot of fun yeah so you you worked in a
17:27 - truck wrap company yeah and that was
17:29 - like literally applying your graic
17:31 - design that is a practical job that you
17:33 - can get as a graic designer doing
17:35 - Graphics you know doing them with
17:38 - particular client specifications working
17:40 - within design constraints right the the
17:42 - big thing about design and how it's
17:43 - different from art and take this from a
17:46 - non designer non- artist is like with
17:48 - design you have so many additional
17:49 - constraints that you have to work for
17:51 - like clients are imposing or the laws of
17:53 - physics are imposing rules upon you uh
17:57 - and you know like you said you had to do
17:58 - a lot of mathematics to figure out like
18:00 - the dimensions of the car and like you
18:02 - only have so much canvas and you have to
18:04 - make every you know perspective of the
18:07 - truck interesting and identifiable
18:09 - probably I don't know what fun you
18:10 - mention the perspective cuz like I don't
18:12 - know if you've ever seen some of the
18:13 - memes where like the door opens and it
18:15 - looks weird so like you know you even
18:17 - have to take those kind of things into
18:18 - consideration it's you know it's crazy
18:21 - yeah you don't want it to look maob like
18:23 - the person's heads cut off when they
18:24 - roll down the window or something yeah
18:26 - exactly
18:29 - yeah so uh so right out of school you
18:34 - get this job and like were you excited
18:35 - at the time like I'm going to do graphic
18:36 - design or did this feel like kind of
18:37 - like a Backwater for you like is there
18:40 - like a big leagues for graphic design
18:41 - that you like had your eyes set on and
18:44 - this was like a step toward that or what
18:45 - what were you thinking in terms of
18:46 - career progression yeah so I think at
18:49 - that time like so I was working
18:51 - part-time at the other job and honestly
18:53 - I think I was just trying to find a job
18:55 - so I was literally on Monster I don't
18:57 - know if Monster's still around but I was
18:59 - that I could that seemed interes to uh
19:02 - to try to S it over um it it was you
19:06 - know it was challenging to find I'm sure
19:08 - it still is but um you know that's the
19:10 - kind of challenge that you run into and
19:12 - um I never did any like internships or
19:14 - anything like that when I was coming to
19:15 - school which you know I don't know if
19:17 - that would have helped or not but uh say
19:19 - you graduate from college 2010 okay so
19:23 - pretty pretty close to the uh Financial
19:26 - recession that uh was like the worst so
19:29 - I actually have talked to lots of people
19:30 - who graduated in
19:32 - 2009 okay 2008 2009 is like even worse
19:35 - but I mentioned you're not that far out
19:37 - of there so there was still diminished
19:39 - opportunity um what kind of uh what what
19:43 - would have your ideal job like when
19:45 - people went to design school and you all
19:47 - got together and you're like playing
19:49 - board games or you're having a party or
19:51 - something and you talk about like what
19:52 - the future is going to hold what would
19:53 - people be excited about what were people
19:55 - aspiring to do with their Graphics
19:56 - design chops yeah I mean I always
19:58 - imagine working at some kind of agency
20:01 - um you know I I think back to the TV
20:04 - series madmen and you know beyond all
20:05 - the the negative angles of Mad Men in
20:08 - that era um just like being able to work
20:10 - at a company the client comes in being
20:13 - able to create that design process like
20:15 - that that inspired me a lot um it's not
20:17 - a projector it's a spaceship or it's
20:20 - it's a time machine right that's what he
20:21 - says yeah man great I love that show I
20:24 - tell everybody to watch it even if you
20:25 - don't care about advertising even if you
20:27 - don't care about the 19
20:29 - in America and all the social issues and
20:32 - everything that show is just a
20:34 - masterpiece through and through like
20:35 - it's Abby the editor that edits your
20:38 - work when you submit things and and that
20:39 - edits my work uh she is also I think
20:42 - it's her favorite show too like she and
20:44 - I always like make madman in jokes and
20:47 - stuff like that so good it's so good but
20:50 - yeah um sorry so so that's kind of like
20:52 - what you're envisioning and I guess
20:53 - madman wasn't on the air back then was
20:56 - it like if I remember correctly it was
20:59 - like right when I got out of school and
21:02 - was trying to find a job if I'm not
21:04 - crazy um so like it was inspiring that
21:07 - career maybe I'm mixing my times but
21:09 - yeah so so the first season or two might
21:12 - have been out by the time you you
21:13 - graduated so yeah yeah I mean would you
21:17 - all have like watch parties and stuff or
21:18 - anything like that like because I
21:20 - imagine a lot of designers were really
21:21 - into this man not I would never had any
21:24 - watch parties but I do remember just uh
21:27 - you between col and getting that first
21:29 - part-time job like I spent like a whole
21:31 - summer longer than a summer at my mom's
21:33 - house and I just there myself watching
21:35 - it um and yeah watch parties would have
21:39 - been fun in college but I don't I don't
21:40 - know that it really in my circles really
21:43 - blew up um because I didn't really
21:45 - honestly hang out with too much
21:46 - designers like in college and stuff um
21:50 - so yeah yeah well what kind of people
21:53 - were you hanging out with Gamers um well
21:55 - the photography te uh people uh and then
21:58 - just uh I don't know I had friends from
22:01 - uh uh from my area met new friends and I
22:05 - wouldn't say there's any like specific
22:07 - type of people it's just random people I
22:09 - met through college because you know
22:10 - Penn State's so huge like it's so easy
22:13 - to make friends in completely different
22:15 - areas and um I mean of course there's
22:18 - you have your clicks everywhere but uh
22:20 - like it's just easy to meet so many
22:21 - different people of totally different
22:23 - types yeah and uh for perspective
22:27 - currently they have around 90
22:29 - ,000 students enrolled that's a massive
22:32 - University uh and of course one of the
22:34 - most grew since I've been there but yeah
22:37 - yeah wow uh so uh from truck reps yeah
22:43 - yeah where do you move on so during that
22:45 - time I pitched to them to build their
22:47 - website so I did that um and that helped
22:51 - me kind of spend some time
22:52 - professionally doing yeah quote unquote
22:55 - professionally um I was also just like
22:57 - with a friend's building uh like a deals
23:00 - site in the background do you remember
23:02 - woot.com well woot.com and Sh woot was
23:05 - the best they had the best cool funny
23:07 - shirts I would always buy those at
23:09 - Christmas time for my family and like
23:11 - every time they're like all right I
23:12 - wonder what I got from Quinsy this year
23:14 - oh it's a
23:16 - shirt they had so many good ones though
23:18 - and I remember uh I always had like the
23:20 - deal trackers so I was watching him but
23:22 - this deal say it like I would uh there
23:24 - was woot.com there was a bunch of other
23:25 - ones and it would like uh uh pull them
23:28 - all into one site I I never actually
23:30 - launched this thing to the public but I
23:32 - was working on it and I was learning PHP
23:33 - and I was learning all these uh tools to
23:36 - you know web development things to build
23:38 - this site um so like while it never
23:40 - launched it was a huge learning
23:41 - experience but anyways so that was some
23:43 - of my spare time spent leading me to um
23:48 - where I eventually got my first
23:49 - full-time web design job working at a
23:52 - startup called show Clicks uh which was
23:54 - an event ticking software company um and
23:57 - I was able to pull that design and
23:59 - development uh where I would create
24:02 - custom Pages for some of their ticking
24:03 - ticketing software but also uh I built
24:06 - like their entire marketing site uh
24:08 - landing pages for that and that was a
24:11 - huge learning experience in itself yeah
24:14 - yeah are they still around or have they
24:16 - been acquired by uh the Big Ticket
24:19 - Master the big bad the final boss of uh
24:22 - any like person who wants to go see
24:24 - their uh see a Taylor Swift show or
24:25 - something I think fortunately there's
24:27 - still so they they were acquired by
24:29 - something called Patron technology I
24:31 - don't know who they are but there they
24:33 - still seem to be not under Ticket Master
24:35 - thankfully uh you know um but they were
24:38 - you know they were a small uh company
24:40 - based out of Pittsburgh um and they
24:41 - worked with a lot of cool events uh so
24:44 - yeah I had a lot of fun working through
24:45 - there yeah and then uh I'm curious so
24:50 - when was your first like because
24:53 - currently like your job title is
24:55 - developer experien engineer which is
24:57 - yeah yeah yeah really cool did you grad
25:00 - like I mean you already had design
25:01 - skills and you're already kind of
25:02 - thinking about like doing user research
25:05 - and understanding like uh what the end
25:07 - user is and yeah developer experience
25:09 - like there are lots of business to
25:11 - developer b2d um tools out there like
25:14 - obviously like any cloud services
25:16 - company like they're not primarily
25:17 - marketing to like the mass public
25:19 - they're trying to Market to developers
25:21 - and get people to build on their tools
25:23 - like what is your kind of
25:25 - like perception of the developer
25:28 - experience
25:28 - engineer role and how would you compare
25:31 - that to like just like is that similar
25:33 - to like developer advocacy is it similar
25:37 - to like like you you go to a lot of
25:40 - conferences and things like that like
25:41 - like how would you describe that and how
25:43 - did you get into that line yeah um so
25:46 - kind of starting off how I see uh how
25:49 - that role fits into the bigger picture
25:51 - um I think a lot of this kind of falls
25:52 - under the developer relations tree um
25:56 - you know it's arguable if it could fall
25:58 - under like other things or be its own
26:00 - bucket but um ultimately I like I I work
26:03 - with developers to help them become more
26:04 - productive and build cool things you
26:06 - know hopefully that's with the product
26:08 - that I'm working for cloud but I
26:09 - generally just want to see developers
26:11 - become successful um part of uh the way
26:14 - that I see the difference between
26:15 - developer experience and then developer
26:17 - advocacy is developer advocacy is more
26:20 - uh working directly in the community um
26:22 - more traditionally going to things like
26:23 - the events and uh creating a Discord uh
26:27 - for you know community with people
26:29 - hitting Community forms and stuff and
26:31 - while I do that stuff as like as part of
26:32 - my role it's not necessarily required or
26:35 - standard um what I typically do is
26:37 - anything code oriented so creating code
26:40 - examples content of course to go along
26:42 - with that um I create demo applications
26:45 - I uh I create and manage and create and
26:49 - manage and SDK uh to interface with
26:51 - kinary um basically just like anything
26:53 - that you can think of that would be code
26:54 - related that can help uh people uh
26:57 - succeed ultimately interesting so to an
27:00 - extent you might describe
27:03 - uh developer advocacy as as kind of like
27:06 - a hybrid like developer kind of almost
27:07 - sales type role uh and I'm not sure if
27:10 - that that may be an uncharitable
27:12 - description of the field but but
27:14 - essentially you are trying to get people
27:15 - to like be familiar with the the tool
27:19 - and adopt it but you're more focused on
27:21 - like okay once they're familiar with the
27:23 - tool once they're familiar with uh like
27:25 - they they're like okay I need to solve
27:28 - problem with why solution your why
27:30 - solution and what do you have for me
27:32 - that can help me solve this problem
27:33 - you're you're actually building the
27:34 - tools that help developers get those
27:37 - things done yeah and one thing like
27:40 - specifically that at least if you're
27:42 - doing it right the one thing that
27:43 - differentiates developer relations that
27:45 - tree compared to things like sales or
27:47 - marketing is that there's kind of a
27:50 - difference in priority where um my
27:52 - priority is the developer uh and then
27:54 - you know hopefully you can use the
27:55 - product but may that might not always be
27:57 - the case whereas sales and marketing is
28:00 - uh the product is the the priority so if
28:02 - from my perspective is I want you to
28:04 - solve that problem um hopefully it's
28:07 - with Cloud night whereas sales and
28:08 - marketing is I want you to solve that
28:10 - problem with that product uh if you can
28:12 - kind of see that differentiat okay so
28:14 - just to recap I want you to solve that
28:15 - problem versus I want you to solve that
28:18 - problem with my tool exactly exactly
28:21 - okay um and you know again like ideally
28:24 - like uh the tool can be helpful like if
28:27 - I believe in the product which which I
28:28 - do you know I I can see a lot of value
28:30 - in the person using it to solve those
28:33 - problems but ultimately I want you to
28:34 - solve that problem with or without it
28:37 - yeah and that makes a lot of sense and
28:40 - uh I think that's like a very good
28:41 - intellectually honest like uh way to be
28:44 - because you know developers like we're
28:47 - it's actually a pretty small community
28:49 - you might think like oh there there are
28:51 - 30 million professional developers on
28:54 - earth right but you know once you start
28:56 - like stratifying that down to like like
28:59 - different like locations and different
29:02 - areas of expertise and different things
29:04 - like that like I mean how many Cloud
29:07 - Engineers are there in Boston who uh you
29:11 - know do devops in cloud like they might
29:13 - have like a a Meetup and like 50 people
29:15 - come every time or something like that
29:16 - that'd probably be really good
29:17 - attendance for a Meetup but but like you
29:21 - can be kind of a known quantity in that
29:23 - area and people know you and you're giv
29:25 - talks about different stuff and you're
29:26 - building things and when somebody
29:28 - has like hey I need like uh you know an
29:31 - image optimization API that can where I
29:34 - can just like throw an image in there
29:35 - and it can do different things
29:37 - cloudinary can do so many different
29:38 - things it's really cool and we actually
29:40 - recently published a course taught by
29:42 - you on free code Camp uh that was made
29:44 - possible thanks to a grant from cloud
29:46 - Nary uh I've been talking with the cloud
29:49 - Nary folks for like years and we finally
29:51 - made it happen we got we got this course
29:53 - and uh I you know I was just thrilled to
29:55 - finally have an opportunity to have Kobe
29:57 - fak on the the free Camp uh YouTube
29:59 - because you're an amazing teacher uh and
30:02 - and we'll get into that but but just
30:03 - real quick to explain what cloud Nary is
30:05 - for people and I just want to point out
30:07 - this podcast is not sponsored by anybody
30:10 - right this is pro this is made possible
30:13 - by the
30:16 - 9,331 people who support free C Camp
30:18 - each month by donating so if you want to
30:21 - become one of those chill human beings
30:23 - and become a supporter and support our
30:24 - charity and our mission go to fre
30:26 - camp.org donate but I do want to be very
30:28 - clear that like there was no stipulation
30:31 - in our grant that we got from cloud that
30:33 - we would have Kobe on the podcast or
30:35 - anything like that I just reached out
30:36 - because I I genuinely wanted to talk to
30:38 - him uh but it is um it is uh timely that
30:42 - you you did recently publish this course
30:43 - and I want to call that out like if
30:45 - anybody's looking for a course that
30:46 - tells you how to use AI to you know
30:49 - update images and like some of the
30:51 - things that Clary can do are almost like
30:53 - Black Magic like they certainly would be
30:56 - considered you know sourcer if you were
30:58 - to go back 10 years now you can kind of
31:00 - understand how they work with the power
31:03 - of like Ai and things like that maybe
31:04 - you can just give a quick uh explanation
31:07 - of some some of the ways that cloud ner
31:10 - works and why you're excited about it
31:12 - yeah so I kind of like the interesting
31:15 - thing about images and videos is you
31:17 - really don't hit some of the problems
31:18 - that tools like Cloud can uh solve until
31:21 - you get to scale or if you have like
31:23 - specific problems that you want to solve
31:24 - so example um like for your random uh
31:28 - personal blog you probably don't need
31:30 - Cloud n but one thing people like to do
31:32 - is dynamically create social uh images
31:35 - for each of those blog post and Cloud R
31:36 - can do that so that's a personal use
31:38 - case but if you think about going to
31:40 - scale when you have like an e-commerce
31:41 - store with thousands and thousands of
31:43 - images um you need something that's
31:45 - going to be able to you know first of
31:46 - all handle uh that image load being able
31:48 - to manage the the images uh and videos
31:51 - more gracefully on the back end and
31:53 - those kind of things uh and that's where
31:55 - Cloud n really comes in and then from a
31:57 - programmatic perspect perspective you
31:58 - can do things like kind of like a
32:00 - Photoshop API uh with just some URL
32:03 - parameters which makes it pretty
32:04 - compelling so if you want all those
32:06 - images and videos to be a square uh and
32:08 - they're all different shapes and sizes
32:09 - like you can add a little bit of code to
32:12 - um do that to every single one right so
32:14 - it's really hitting those scale issues
32:16 - to just make it easy to work with the
32:17 - products and and like some of the things
32:18 - that it can do though that are really
32:20 - cool like I think it's called like image
32:22 - expansion or something like say you got
32:24 - yeah right what is it called Phill
32:27 - generative is the generative fill so you
32:29 - know generative AI generative fill so
32:31 - let's say you take a picture of me
32:33 - standing here and you want to get the
32:35 - rest of the picture but you don't
32:36 - actually have that to work with like
32:37 - Blade Runner enhance type stuff right
32:40 - like hey change the perspective what is
32:42 - the perspective has to do all this
32:43 - calculation figure out like but it does
32:45 - it it works pretty well so like you if
32:48 - you were to take this picture of me like
32:50 - just like cutting it off wherever this
32:52 - Frame if you're watching the video
32:53 - version of free cocam I'm holding my
32:54 - hands up to the side of my head if
32:56 - you're listening to the audio version
32:58 - which is what I listen to by the way uh
32:59 - I don't uh and yes there is an audio
33:02 - version uh and I encourage everybody to
33:04 - follow Freo camp in Spotify and in uh
33:07 - Apple music wherever you listen to it
33:09 - follow us and there will be a new
33:11 - episode every Friday but um let's say
33:14 - that you have like me and I'm like very
33:16 - tightly cropped in the frame and you
33:18 - want to expand you want to see the rest
33:19 - of my bookshelf uh you know and you want
33:21 - to see the rest of this white wall
33:22 - behind me and things like that like
33:25 - Clary can do that yeah yeah and is just
33:28 - with a little URL parameter um I like to
33:30 - kind of call it uncrop because when
33:32 - you're cropping something you're
33:34 - ultimately going to lose that data right
33:36 - like if I'm cropping you to a square I'm
33:37 - going to lose some of that data of the
33:38 - image and if I don't want to lose any of
33:40 - that data I want to expand that image
33:42 - and that's where that kind of tool can
33:44 - come in yeah and uh it just makes life a
33:49 - lot easier if you're trying to um work
33:51 - with images so again like we're not
33:53 - going to talk a whole lot about Clary
33:54 - but it is your current employer and uh I
33:56 - did want to like explain kind of the
33:58 - Contemporary work that you're doing
33:59 - right now yeah and I think the
34:01 - interesting thing about the course that
34:02 - I published I had a lot of fun with it
34:04 - cuz I was trying to uh replicate as many
34:06 - Google photos uh uh features as I can um
34:09 - and while some of the Google photos
34:11 - features you know just uploading uh
34:13 - images and storing them like that's uh
34:15 - that's not super exciting it's practical
34:17 - but not exciting but I was trying to
34:19 - replicate the Creations so creating a
34:21 - collage creating an animation um what
34:24 - else was it colorpop just real quick the
34:26 - the title of the course is I think like
34:27 - create a clone of Google photos right
34:32 - code your own Google photos like all
34:33 - that different functionality that Google
34:35 - photos have you're going to go in you're
34:36 - going to build a full stack web app and
34:38 - you're going to implement that again
34:39 - this is a free course it's available to
34:41 - anybody who wants to watch it I'm going
34:43 - to link to it in the show notes or in
34:45 - the video description just check it out
34:47 - and uh take in some of Kobe's thoughtful
34:50 - uh deliberately you know planned out
34:52 - teaching and and I think you're going to
34:54 - appreciate his teaching style u but but
34:57 - yeah like of the features that what are
34:59 - some of the funnest features funnest is
35:01 - that a word the most fun features that
35:02 - you implemented that you had the most
35:05 - fun with so the Creations are my top uh
35:07 - that's my favorite but also like the
35:09 - image editor and again like it goes back
35:11 - to just adding the URL parameters so
35:12 - like I was you're able to do so many
35:14 - different things you can remove a
35:15 - background like click remove a
35:16 - background enhance the photo restore the
35:18 - photo um crop it to like different
35:21 - dimensions and add a bunch of filters
35:22 - and effects and like it was uh some of
35:25 - those things were just so easy to
35:26 - implement and you'll see the course
35:28 - because they're just simple URL
35:30 - parameters that you're able to add and
35:31 - your photo just immediately gets that uh
35:33 - transformation it's uh it's pretty wild
35:35 - um but yeah a lot of the creativity is
35:39 - some of the stuff that you don't
35:40 - typically see uh with some of the image
35:42 - and video uh courses that there's a lot
35:44 - of interesting
35:45 - features yeah well we've talked kind of
35:48 - about your developer Journey uh we've
35:50 - talked about your your kind of
35:51 - day-to-day work as a uh I have to look
35:55 - it up developer experience engineer uh
35:57 - uh again developer experience is like an
35:59 - entire field uh making life easier for
36:03 - the 30 million developers out there who
36:04 - have to do things and get tasked with
36:07 - different things Often by product
36:09 - managers who are not technical who don't
36:11 - understand uh like how difficult it is
36:14 - there's that XKCD comic uh it's what do
36:17 - you know what XKCD comic I'm talking
36:19 - about xkd I don't know which comic
36:21 - require five years okay I'm going to
36:23 - read it out loud uh
36:27 - H um okay yeah yeah yeah this is it okay
36:31 - um so I'm just going to describe
36:34 - it I'll just describe it verbally and
36:36 - I'll link to it but um there's this this
36:39 - boss um you know kind of like imagine
36:41 - office space there's a woman in a
36:43 - cubicle at a computer and then there's
36:44 - the the manager with his tie and his
36:46 - coffee kind of like leaning into the
36:48 - cubicle saying when a user takes a photo
36:51 - the app should check whether they're in
36:52 - a national park sure that's easy we'll
36:56 - just use the gis lookup give a few hours
36:58 - and then uh and then the boss says and
37:00 - check whether the photo is of a bird and
37:02 - then the woman says I'll need a research
37:04 - team in 5
37:06 - years and it says in CS it can be hard
37:08 - to explain the difference between easy
37:10 - the easy and the virtually impossible I
37:12 - think that this is like actually today
37:14 - it would be very easy to determine
37:16 - whether there was a bird but this this
37:18 - uh I don't know when this came out uh
37:20 - probably at least 10 15 years ago uh but
37:23 - uh yeah like a lot of non-technical
37:26 - product managers or or semi- technical
37:28 - product managers may take for granted
37:30 - that like oh you can just do XYZ and
37:31 - actually it's really hard to do that
37:33 - right um and so this you know you're
37:37 - creating tools and helping uh make it
37:39 - easier for developers to like have to
37:41 - get things done you know a lot of times
37:44 - the manager may come to you with like
37:46 - kind of unrealistic expectations but if
37:48 - the tooling is good enough you may be
37:49 - able to like figure out a way to like
37:51 - actually meet their unrealistic
37:53 - expectations or you may be able to build
37:55 - something that has never been done
37:56 - before that does kind of like you know a
37:59 - good enough job at imitating like some
38:01 - incredibly hard science problem or
38:03 - something computer science challenge
38:06 - right yeah absolutely and like that's
38:08 - that's part of the uh you know both the
38:11 - fun and the challenge of it is trying to
38:13 - figure out what those uh challenges are
38:15 - that can help people to kind of
38:16 - prioritize that work but also then it's
38:18 - fun trying to uh figure out how I'm
38:21 - going to implement it in an intuitive
38:22 - way something that people are going to
38:24 - very easily understand um and become
38:26 - productive with yeah and that's where
38:28 - teaching comes in like you're somebody
38:29 - who spends a great deal of time thinking
38:31 - about communication right because it's
38:34 - not just like it may have taken you a
38:36 - long time to grock some Concepts you're
38:38 - like ah I finally got it I finally had
38:40 - that flash of uh that that epiphan or
38:43 - that Revelation like oh okay that's how
38:45 - it works but you don't want to have to
38:46 - drag everybody through that like you
38:48 - don't want to have to impose upon
38:49 - everybody to go through that same
38:50 - lengthy thing you may be able to figure
38:51 - out a way to condense things down like
38:53 - Aha and maybe people won't appreciate
38:55 - they didn't fight as hard for the
38:57 - insight because you you gave it to them
38:59 - uh of course a very good teacher can
39:00 - like ask questions to try to lead people
39:02 - on this journey of Discovery and have
39:04 - guard rails to keep them from going off
39:06 - in the total wrong direction and being
39:08 - in the weeds for like several weeks you
39:10 - know um how how do you teach how do you
39:13 - approach teaching and how do you balance
39:15 - like just ex explaining versus getting
39:20 - people to get their hands dirty and kind
39:21 - of like have these Revelations for
39:23 - themselves yeah uh so that's an
39:25 - interesting one um so part of what I try
39:28 - to do anytime that I'm building content
39:30 - is first of all I just kind of build
39:32 - what I want to teach um so with this uh
39:35 - the Google photos course for instance I
39:37 - I built the Google photos clone um I
39:39 - certainly went out of scope for that uh
39:41 - clone and I turned that into a starter
39:44 - template that people can get it's linked
39:45 - on the video um but ultimately like I I
39:48 - get it to a place that I want to teach
39:49 - it and then I try to start thinking
39:51 - about the different concepts you know I
39:52 - try to strip it back a little bit find
39:54 - things that AR aren't necessary to teach
39:56 - things that are just going to distract
39:58 - people from it so one example of that is
40:01 - I a lot of the times I don't teach uh UI
40:05 - uh stuff sometimes I do but it's usually
40:07 - not the focus so I try to come with a
40:09 - starter template that um already has a
40:11 - lot of that to find so that we're not
40:13 - spending a ton of time going through
40:15 - Styles and nitpicking on that we're
40:16 - focusing we're focusing on the actual
40:19 - problem we're trying to solve right um
40:21 - and then trying to break it up into
40:23 - little chunks where we can gradually
40:25 - little by little um build up to the
40:27 - Great thing and you know sometimes that
40:29 - might feel like a longer path than if
40:31 - you were to just to implement it but
40:32 - trying to make sure that we're
40:34 - explaining those Concepts in a gradual
40:36 - way that people are going to understand
40:37 - is critical to make sure that they're
40:39 - not going to just get super confused
40:41 - lost and then wanting to leave because
40:43 - they can't understand from that huge
40:45 - jump yeah absolutely like a lot of the
40:49 - things you're teaching are so
40:50 - unintuitive and like nobody would just
40:52 - independently arrive if like let's say
40:55 - you were like you know an Neanderthal
40:58 - wandering around on a Savannah and you
41:00 - saw this uh or I guess if you were
41:02 - Neanderthal maybe it would be like a
41:03 - frozen tundra or something but you saw
41:05 - this computer and you're like o you
41:08 - wouldn't just independently like arrive
41:09 - at like creating a web app or something
41:11 - like this like this a lot of this stuff
41:12 - is very unintuitive and it requires so
41:15 - many different layers of like uh
41:17 - formality and like understanding of like
41:19 - how different things work together and a
41:22 - lot of the people watching your course
41:23 - don't have the benefit of you know
41:25 - having study computer science and having
41:28 - written their own operating system or
41:29 - written their own uh you know compiler
41:31 - or anything like that and and they may
41:33 - not have a lot of the uh foundational
41:35 - knowledge they may not have had a math
41:37 - class since they were in high school
41:38 - right and so to some extent you have to
41:42 - figure out a way
41:44 - to kind of like summarize a lot of stuff
41:47 - and and it's a single course it's not an
41:49 - interactive experience uh where you're
41:52 - like having a conversation with them and
41:54 - you can answer their questions and walk
41:55 - them through things right you have to
41:56 - kind of like have this middle of the
41:58 - road approach where like the mean person
42:01 - approaching this uh mean in terms of
42:04 - like measure of central tendency uh the
42:07 - mean person who approaches this is going
42:10 - to understand this this and this and
42:12 - like they're less likely to understand
42:14 - this so I'm going to do a quick sidebar
42:15 - and explain this and yeah and that's the
42:18 - tricky thing like I I try really hard to
42:21 - not make any assumptions about uh what
42:23 - somebody already knows like if I'm
42:25 - creating a react tutorial like of I
42:27 - would assume that they know react but
42:29 - I'm not going to assume that they know
42:30 - every little uh API with react I I'm
42:33 - going to typically try to walk through
42:35 - that step by step if it's a New Concept
42:37 - just to make sure that they're able to
42:39 - still follow along um even if that's a
42:41 - completely fresh concept um I think
42:43 - especially for like YouTube at least for
42:46 - my content like the people that I I
42:48 - can't I really don't know if the
42:50 - majority of my audience is beginner or
42:52 - or Advanced but I try to make it where
42:54 - the problems are interesting enough for
42:55 - the advanced people um but friendly
42:58 - enough that people who are more of a
42:59 - beginner can still go through it um and
43:02 - both can enjoy it and learn something
43:04 - from it and an experienced tutorial
43:07 - Creator you know somebody who's created
43:08 - 176 tutorials on YouTube like that's
43:12 - that's like you get feedback from the
43:13 - audience and you start to like
43:15 - understand oh like I glossed over that
43:16 - but I should have gone in more detail or
43:18 - oh people feel patronized by the fact
43:20 - that I'm explaining this very basic
43:21 - thing and it sounds like most of my
43:23 - audience does understand how this thing
43:24 - works and I don't need to go into such
43:26 - detail right right
43:27 - trying to strike a balance where you're
43:28 - respectful of people's time but at the
43:30 - same time uh you know also not overly uh
43:35 - presumptive yeah for sure for sure yeah
43:38 - it's a tricky balance yeah and uh I have
43:42 - uh I mean you you've created so much
43:45 - successful stuff over the years in terms
43:48 - of just so many different courses that
43:49 - people have walked away with like yeah I
43:51 - like this guy he's a good teacher and I
43:53 - hear it all the time like uh definitely
43:55 - like I'll I'll see comments and stuff
43:56 - like like whenever people tweet on free
43:59 - cocam like with the tutorials uh again
44:01 - you've published uh what is it like 68
44:04 - tutorials including like the Santa Claus
44:06 - tracker that was epic the Santa Claus
44:09 - tracker app uh but like it's always a
44:12 - joy CU there's like a little button on
44:14 - free camp and people can say tweet a
44:15 - thanks to the author and so I see those
44:17 - a lot and people it's like oh yeah I
44:20 - love seeing that I'm glad that they like
44:21 - uh K's article yeah yeah um man the
44:25 - Santa Tracker that's one of my favorites
44:27 - and cuz so it has more history than just
44:31 - a Santa Tracker cuz the reason I got
44:33 - into teaching in the first place is cuz
44:35 - I was working at a company where I was
44:36 - building a satellite tasking application
44:38 - that you would overlay the data on a map
44:40 - and before taking on that project I was
44:43 - like I have to build a map I'm going to
44:45 - go crazy this is so hard but like it
44:47 - totally wasn't as hard as it as I
44:49 - thought it was going to be so I was
44:51 - thinking you know other people probably
44:52 - struggle through that as well and Maps
44:54 - can have a really significant impact on
44:57 - science and stuff like that so uh I
44:59 - decided to start talking about it and
45:00 - teaching it and um so that's where that
45:02 - kind of seed came from but I love the
45:05 - Santa Tracker because it's also
45:06 - something that I've seen dads and
45:08 - parents say you know I just spent time
45:10 - with my kid building this Santa Tracker
45:12 - and they had a lot of fun with it I love
45:14 - seeing that kind of thing yeah and
45:16 - that's like what it's all about like I I
45:19 - love it when people are like I I played
45:20 - learn to code RPG with my kids you know
45:23 - or um you know like we worked we went
45:25 - through this python course together and
45:27 - and like we just had our laptops next to
45:29 - each other and I was like oh man that's
45:31 - like gives you the feels like you know
45:34 - uh that you're being able to play a part
45:36 - in like this you know role like the the
45:41 - the father son or the father uh daughter
45:43 - or or the mother son mother daughter
45:46 - like that relationship right like like
45:48 - they're going to have this shared moment
45:49 - and it was around something that you
45:51 - created you know um yeah that that
45:54 - definitely like one of those kind of
45:55 - like hair standing up on your
45:57 - on your arm type uh it's such a joy that
45:59 - we can bring those experiences to people
46:02 - yeah and
46:04 - um I'm really interested in just like
46:06 - learning a little bit more about your
46:08 - journey why did you start creating
46:10 - YouTube courses like this wasn't your
46:12 - job right like you had a full-time job
46:15 - doing other stuff and you just what
46:17 - inspired you to like do that first big
46:19 - upload to Youtube yeah so it began with
46:23 - the mapping projects uh but then I just
46:26 - kind of
46:27 - started so most of it was writing at
46:29 - first and uh after I was talking about
46:32 - mapping I I didn't want to just talk all
46:34 - about mapping and become the map guy so
46:36 - so I started writing about other things
46:38 - and as you saw in free Cod Camp you
46:40 - could probably see there was that map
46:41 - one and then other stuff um but then at
46:45 - some point I don't know what really
46:47 - triggered me to want to do YouTube I
46:48 - just kind of thought hey maybe I'll give
46:50 - it a shot see what happens um and I
46:52 - remember I was so nervous posting the
46:54 - first one the very first one my first
46:56 - video was if I remember correctly was
46:57 - creating the table of contents inside of
46:59 - the free code Camp um content editor I
47:03 - don't know if you remember that yeah the
47:04 - the old ghost CMS yes which sadly we're
47:07 - still using just it's deprecated and
47:11 - ghost has moved on to other products but
47:12 - we we are migrating and uh if you are an
47:15 - author on the freeo camp uh publication
47:18 - soon we're going to be doing it on hash
47:19 - we're having such a great time with hash
47:21 - node and we've been working very closely
47:23 - with the hash node team uh and I've
47:25 - known them since the beginning like ear
47:27 - days uh you know and uh always inspired
47:30 - by them and and we're finally going to
47:32 - use them as a CMS they have like this
47:34 - Enterprise CMS that they're providing
47:35 - for free to our Char is the Headless
47:37 - hash node yeah nice nice I did a
47:40 - tutorial on that it's it's a cool
47:42 - product yeah and they've got like a lot
47:44 - of other stuff that's incorporated into
47:46 - that that uh is going to be available as
47:49 - well um that's awesome yeah they're
47:51 - making heavy or very fast progress with
47:53 - it yeah you've got like a lot of videos
47:55 - from the early days all with the kind of
47:58 - you're kind of like almost winking
47:59 - you're like taking a bite out of like
48:00 - this lollipop that's it's like the Earth
48:02 - on a lollipop or something like that
48:04 - yeah so that that photo amongst other
48:07 - photos is from my think days because uh
48:10 - thinki would use employees for product
48:12 - photos and I became like one of the more
48:15 - comical ones cuz like I would make the
48:16 - funny faces and everything you know
48:18 - surprised I don't do that more for
48:19 - YouTube thumbnails right but uh like
48:21 - that was one of the things the other one
48:23 - was I became famous not famous
48:24 - internally for hugging plushies so
48:27 - that's where my uh my yellow profile
48:29 - picture comes from the Star Wars one
48:30 - because I was modeling I was modeling uh
48:33 - Star Wars plushies but wow you're a male
48:36 - model is is it anything like in Zander
48:38 - do you mod days do you are you like
48:40 - programmed to
48:44 - assassinate that's
48:45 - classified yeah but why m
48:50 - models but but that's really cool so
48:52 - this is actual like product photo of you
48:54 - like so there were like you know Pops
48:57 - that were shaped like the Earth or
48:59 - something like that yeah so it was a
49:01 - series of uh of lollipops that had like
49:04 - different planets and the Earth was one
49:06 - of them and I just thought it was
49:07 - interesting uh for that particular
49:08 - because I was doing the mapping stuff so
49:10 - I was doing mapping and I was taking a
49:11 - bite of the earth I just thought it was
49:12 - a fun little play um but I I use that
49:15 - and I just kind of stuck it on there
49:17 - because the whole idea of uh people
49:19 - seeing my photo and like oh that's his
49:22 - video I'll watch that cuz I know that I
49:23 - liked it if they liked it right of
49:24 - course um and I just kept it on on there
49:27 - for the longest time and it's pretty
49:28 - memorable uh I mean I see it on like
49:30 - pretty much every video up until 3 years
49:32 - ago four years ago so and you know who
49:35 - knows if it was a good idea to take it
49:36 - off or not I was trying to take my
49:38 - thumbnails more seriously um I don't
49:40 - know I still haven't cracked myself for
49:43 - the thumbnail game I find that so
49:45 - challenging but yeah actually you you
49:47 - took it off I'm scrolling through your
49:48 - videos and you added it back in and you
49:50 - were using it as of like a year and a
49:52 - half ago two years ago yeah trying to
49:55 - test out see see works and what's not um
49:58 - yeah but I I don't know I I haven't
50:00 - learned I feel like I haven't learned
50:02 - anything cuz as soon as I feel like I
50:03 - did learn something like it it doesn't
50:05 - work so I'll tell you a secret on on
50:07 - thumbnails people may think oh free C
50:09 - Camp's thumbnails are kind of bland in
50:12 - our like area of expertise like these
50:14 - long tutorials you don't want people to
50:16 - like just click through like like oh
50:17 - that looks so interesting was so fun
50:19 - click it and then they watch like 10
50:20 - seconds and they leave that's actually
50:22 - bad for us in the YouTube recommendation
50:25 - algorithm like we want to look very
50:27 - serious and like literal like you know
50:30 - python in 6 hours or something like that
50:32 - right we want it to look like
50:34 - intimidating because we only want people
50:36 - to click on it who are actually serious
50:37 - about watching it and then that like
50:40 - means that the the average person is
50:41 - going to watch it a lot more and it's
50:42 - going to be so like YouTube's algorithm
50:45 - and this is all Theory nobody knows how
50:46 - it actually works including the
50:47 - engineers at YouTube whom we talk to
50:49 - regularly um yeah but but the idea is
50:52 - that like okay now only people that are
50:55 - serious about python are going to be
50:56 - presented this video and they're going
50:57 - to click it and they're going to watch
50:58 - it and they're going to get a whole lot
51:00 - out of it and so the average watch time
51:01 - is ridiculously long because we did that
51:04 - like I mean we could actually be even
51:06 - less fancy in our thumbnails and just
51:08 - put python 6 hours like like really ugly
51:11 - font and only people and often I see
51:13 - like the videos that get recommended to
51:14 - me in YouTube uh a lot of times they
51:17 - won't even have a thumbnail it'll just
51:19 - be some guy at a video title but the
51:21 - video is really good yeah I don't know
51:23 - if you know web dev Cody but um it's
51:26 - funny I was talking to him before and
51:27 - like for a while he would always just
51:28 - use the default photo um he eventually
51:31 - started to test the thumbnails but like
51:33 - a lot of his just default thumbnails
51:35 - would just perform so well and he's like
51:37 - why am I spending time on these
51:38 - thumbnails when you know the default is
51:40 - working so well for me yeah it's it's
51:43 - funny yeah I mean not all of us are Mr
51:45 - Beast with like you know heaps of
51:47 - burning money and stuff I don't know
51:49 - what he puts in his thumbnails but does
51:50 - get lots of kids to click but like when
51:52 - you're when you're going after like
51:53 - software Engineers who are like okay I
51:55 - got some time dur lunch I want to learn
51:57 - something like you want something that
51:59 - is a strik the balance between appealing
52:01 - and serious and uh sufficient depth
52:04 - right like you've got uh a lot of your
52:07 - videos um are just really quick like
52:10 - bites uh but then you've also got uh you
52:13 - know live streams of you uh building
52:15 - stuff that that are quite a bit longer
52:17 - you do have like more in-depth courses
52:20 - uh and you've got like do you have
52:21 - multi-art courses on here I don't have
52:23 - any multiart um any of the multiart
52:26 - would just uh would be over on like uh
52:28 - Egghead or something like that yeah um
52:30 - but not on YouTube and that's a great
52:31 - opportunity to talk about like you're
52:32 - not just creating courses on uh YouTube
52:36 - and uh occasionally you know creating a
52:38 - course for free code camp and then
52:39 - publishing text based tutorials you
52:41 - create a lot of places um can you talk
52:44 - about like how the like if you're a
52:47 - developer and you get really good at
52:49 - like a tool or something and like one of
52:51 - these platforms like plural side or
52:53 - Egghead or frontend Masters front end uh
52:56 - I can't remember all the names of them
52:57 - there are a lot of them and they're um
52:59 - paid platforms that you pay like or
53:01 - O'Reilly right like the big textbook
53:03 - companies we have I think Bo on the free
53:05 - Camp YouTube channel has been approached
53:07 - uh by Manning and he's published a a
53:09 - couple courses for Manning for example
53:11 - like can you talk about uh how they
53:13 - approached you and like how how that
53:15 - went down and you developed those
53:16 - courses yeah so I approached them like
53:21 - this is years ago at this point because
53:23 - I was just familiar with uh some of
53:25 - their content saw a lot of uh people who
53:27 - I respected and uh looked up to as
53:30 - content creators uh were publishing on
53:32 - Egghead and um you know I wanted to be
53:35 - there I was you know inspired to uh
53:37 - create my own course on heed so I was
53:39 - reaching out to
53:41 - them uh I think I was able to find
53:43 - somebody that I was friends with who uh
53:45 - was already working there or not making
53:47 - courses from there and kind of get my in
53:49 - um but then from there like I learned a
53:51 - lot from egad throughout this process
53:53 - and one of the things that I like to
53:55 - publish on egad is a opposed to trying
53:56 - like you to me or something like that is
53:58 - um how ethical and how uh just real
54:01 - Egghead and Joel and the team around
54:03 - them are they're just really great
54:05 - people they're really focused on um
54:07 - really trying to provide a great
54:09 - education experience for people um of
54:11 - course you know it's a business as well
54:13 - but um just the the thought process that
54:17 - goes through all that is just really
54:18 - compelling for me as opposed for me to
54:20 - try to just push it on any random site
54:23 - um but you know I learned a lot from
54:25 - them for my my coding style like how I
54:28 - format my code editor how I uh remove
54:31 - distractions from the screen and um also
54:33 - how to kind of break some of that
54:34 - content I learned some of that from them
54:36 - um and it's just been an interesting and
54:39 - fun proog uh process a long the way and
54:41 - what is your kind of like workflow when
54:43 - you're sitting down to record because uh
54:46 - you you record a lot and uh obviously
54:49 - you've got like this really nice
54:50 - background with lots of plushies you got
54:52 - your uh GitHub octocat back there and oh
54:55 - yeah uh and you've got like uh you know
54:58 - baby Yoda uh stuff like that
55:01 - like and you have do you have another
55:03 - background that you use a lot in your
55:05 - videos too uh no so this is this is my
55:07 - primary setup um if it's another
55:09 - background it's either because I'm
55:11 - traveling or just an older video from um
55:14 - I I usually so like I have my desk here
55:15 - and I usually just record from here I've
55:17 - been thinking about doing like random
55:19 - b-roll things like in my backyard or
55:21 - something like that but I don't know I
55:22 - haven't gotten that creative in my
55:24 - videos yet I just sit here and knock
55:25 - them out yeah and what like do you have
55:27 - like a workflow like how what what goes
55:29 - into creating a video like do you just
55:32 - like hey that should be a video and you
55:33 - just sit down and knock it out or is
55:35 - there a lot of planning that goes into
55:36 - it yeah so I wouldn't say there's a ton
55:38 - of planning but what I typically do is I
55:40 - try to keep just like a backlog of ideas
55:43 - that I that I want to create a tutorial
55:45 - on and um that can be challenging since
55:47 - I already have 176 videos trying to
55:49 - think about something new that I want to
55:51 - do that I haven't already done um but
55:54 - once I have that the very first thing
55:55 - similar to when I do a course I build
55:57 - the thing first um I then try to create
56:00 - an article a written tutorial for every
56:02 - single video that I create so I'll first
56:04 - write that out um and while I don't
56:06 - create a script that somewhat becomes a
56:08 - script mostly just in terms of like the
56:11 - flow of the video so how I'm going to
56:13 - walk through and teach uh teach the the
56:15 - uh content and Concepts um but from
56:18 - there I again I don't create a script I
56:20 - know that's um something I eventually
56:22 - want to try out but just currently don't
56:24 - feel like I necessarily need it um but
56:26 - then I I just kind of sit down I try to
56:30 - record an intro uh and try to work
56:32 - through the content um I'm one thing
56:35 - that I do differently than I think a lot
56:37 - of people is I don't just record one
56:39 - long video and then edit it I create
56:41 - little Clips so I'll record the intro
56:43 - I'll record little blips of like every
56:45 - little uh everything that I say or code
56:48 - up and then uh edit those down all
56:50 - together but I kind of edit it as I work
56:52 - through the video so like if I have a
56:54 - bad take like I'll just go through and
56:56 - and delete all those bad takes before I
56:58 - drag it into the uh video editor so that
57:01 - like that's just a pretty it's just
57:03 - trimming it from there um but yeah
57:06 - that's so I think that's Yeah so
57:09 - basically just creating the article is
57:12 - almost like the prep work to being
57:14 - having everything in your head and
57:15 - having a clear kind of like almost like
57:17 - subconscious like okay I kind of know
57:19 - where I need to go from here so exactly
57:22 - like the way I describe it like when I
57:24 - uh when I write a lot of times uh I've
57:26 - already gone through I've done something
57:28 - so many times that I'm like it's almost
57:29 - kind of like the information is going
57:31 - through me but that what's really
57:33 - happened is I've structured everything
57:35 - in my brain and it just it flows like
57:38 - for these interviews I know they
57:39 - probably seem incredibly unpolished and
57:41 - rough and that's that's intentional but
57:44 - uh what I do my my process is just to do
57:46 - a ton of research listen to a ton of
57:48 - other podcast people have been on and uh
57:50 - and kind of build up this this kind of
57:52 - like uh this General like feeling this
57:56 - Vibe uh for who Kobe f is right uh and
58:00 - similarly like with anything I do I try
58:02 - to it's it's heavily Vibe based it's
58:05 - it's doing a lot of research and then
58:07 - it's just sitting down and uh you know
58:09 - doing it and it just kind of happens uh
58:12 - is that is that kind of how you feel
58:13 - like a lot of the course Happ it just
58:15 - it's happening you're not really
58:16 - thinking about it too much you're
58:17 - focused instead on what the next thing
58:19 - you need to do is yeah totally and you
58:22 - know the the writing out the Articles
58:24 - certainly helps from like a code
58:26 - perspective of the steps of the code but
58:28 - um like it's a different medium cuz I'll
58:30 - be recording the video um and something
58:32 - just might not feel right as I'm trying
58:34 - to teach it in a video in the video
58:36 - format so either I'll try to rework it
58:38 - or figure it out or sometimes just run
58:40 - into bugs um but like it's I do kind of
58:44 - just go off the cuff a lot uh based off
58:46 - of the prep work that I did um and you
58:48 - know so far it seems to be working out
58:50 - for me I I know not everybody can uh do
58:53 - it that way they need the script but um
58:56 - I I have a hard time uh trying to go the
58:59 - script route personally yeah uh it's
59:02 - interesting with script because
59:03 - technically like everything you deliver
59:05 - is more precise but there's like less
59:07 - feeling yeah it's kind of like the
59:09 - tradeoff I look at it because like yeah
59:11 - I can like when I read my book like the
59:13 - audio book version of the of my learn de
59:15 - code and get a developer job book that I
59:18 - I authored last year and released on the
59:20 - podcast feed it's on the same feed that
59:22 - uh if you're listening to the audio
59:24 - format you can go listen to my full
59:25 - audio is like 4 hours uh painstakingly
59:28 - edited it took forever to do it and
59:30 - because I wanted to get like the exact
59:32 - intonation and everything just like just
59:34 - perfect you can still there's still some
59:36 - imperfections you can hear my kids you
59:37 - know playing piano in the background and
59:39 - stuff like that during certain parts but
59:42 - uh but yeah like reading from a script
59:45 - you can sound very audite you can have
59:48 - very deliberate decisions around the
59:50 - words you use and how you structure
59:51 - things and have you know witty kind of
59:54 - like Transitions and stuff like that it
59:55 - doesn't feel as freewheeling as this but
59:58 - uh but at the same time it's doesn't
60:00 - feel as real it's scripted right it's
60:02 - just like uh like watching like uh
60:05 - reality TV which is heavily scripted uh
60:08 - or or very you know deliberately edited
60:10 - I guess versus watching like you know in
60:13 - Star Trek they never uh you know nobody
60:16 - ever burps and says excuse me or
60:17 - something like that right that doesn't
60:19 - happen in start Tre because it's not
60:20 - relevant to the plot everything that
60:22 - happens is like relevant to you know
60:24 - solving the weird like space anomaly or
60:27 - something at the T 20 minutes or so yeah
60:30 - yeah any sort of flavor comedic relief
60:32 - or anything like that is like very
60:34 - intentionally sprinkled in there because
60:36 - they're like oh we're about to go to
60:36 - commercial break we need to like add
60:38 - something dramatic so that people will
60:40 - you know stay tuned
60:42 - dur there's so much engineering that
60:44 - goes into that and I appreciate that
60:46 - engineering and I appreciate watching
60:47 - like a well done scripted thing but then
60:50 - I also appreciate just watching
60:51 - documentaries where people are like
60:52 - walking on the street like putting a mic
60:54 - in somebody's face yeah like that so
60:57 - yeah it's anyway um similar topic like I
61:02 - I've for a long time all the talks that
61:03 - I would give like I would always do a
61:05 - full script and that's how I did like a
61:07 - year or two of like all my online talks
61:08 - for instance um but like I I recently
61:11 - tried to start doing non-scripted talks
61:13 - and um I was super nervous about it
61:15 - because part of my issue is like uh like
61:17 - with anxiety like my mind would just go
61:19 - blank and I would forget the things that
61:21 - I would want to say but um spending
61:23 - extra time trying to like think about
61:25 - the the slides differently like rather
61:27 - than trying to create the slides to fit
61:29 - the script I would create the slides
61:30 - based off the story that I want to tell
61:32 - um and I was able to kind of position
61:34 - myself in a better way that I was able
61:36 - to do so unscripted and I think it's I
61:38 - think it ended up turning out better
61:40 - because while I was still super nervous
61:42 - about it like I was able to you know
61:44 - kind of feel like what people were
61:45 - thinking in the room what I what I
61:47 - actually wanted to tell them to inspire
61:50 - them a little bit more yeah and to some
61:52 - extent like by not having like heavily
61:54 - scripted it's more interactive and it it
61:56 - feels more organic like the things
61:58 - you're saying like oh that brings up a
62:00 - good point you know or you know anyway
62:03 - um I want to learn a little bit more
62:05 - about you as a person because in
62:07 - addition to being this uh you know
62:08 - accomplished engineer accomplished
62:10 - teacher very prolific you are a family
62:14 - man uh y maybe you could talk about uh
62:18 - meeting your wife and and something that
62:21 - uh you and I have in common is we are
62:24 - both married to people who were
62:26 - originally from a different country
62:28 - who've since naturalized as US citizens
62:31 - um yeah can you can you talk about that
62:35 - yeah so uh my wife she's from Brazil uh
62:37 - I absolutely love Brazil so shout out to
62:39 - all the Brazilians out there um she came
62:43 - over originally to be an opair and I met
62:46 - her online to be honest and opair for
62:49 - people who I didn't even know what that
62:50 - was until like a year ago yeah what is
62:53 - that uh so it's like a work and study
62:55 - thing so the goal is that she's able to
62:58 - come over and study uh in the United
63:00 - States but to kind of support that uh
63:03 - she would uh help kind of watch over uh
63:05 - she would live with a family and help uh
63:08 - watch over their kids and stuff um but
63:10 - like the primary goal of that was to be
63:12 - able to study get the get the experience
63:14 - over here um take that back and you know
63:17 - apply it to her career uh but I I like
63:20 - to say that I stole her because I uh you
63:22 - know we met online uh and we hit it off
63:25 - and she had no intent of staying over
63:27 - here but um you know after hitting it
63:29 - off we I she ended up staying here with
63:32 - me um but we went through that process
63:35 - of uh you know going through the green
63:38 - cards which was super painful going
63:40 - through and then going through the
63:41 - citizenship uh which was also really
63:43 - painful um and I say painful because of
63:45 - the uh the processes in place uh not
63:49 - necessarily anything specific to us it's
63:50 - just the process everybody has to go
63:52 - through is painful in order to get there
63:55 - um but you know it was it was worth it
63:58 - you know we're happy and so she was like
64:01 - did you experience the same thing kind
64:02 - of Mary Poppins like uh like staying
64:05 - with the family watching the kids
64:08 - probably helping the kids get to and
64:09 - from school and stuff like that yeah is
64:11 - that like an opare like it's kind of
64:13 - like a a living Nanny yeah yeah but then
64:17 - like you take classes or whatever uh for
64:20 - like the study aspect of it um so while
64:22 - the kids are at school you can go and
64:23 - you can what did she study
64:26 - yeah I'm not sure of the specifics
64:27 - around uh that angle um uh I don't know
64:31 - what class I don't remember what classes
64:33 - she took um but that was eight years ago
64:36 - now yeah um but yeah well
64:39 - congratulations on helping her thank
64:41 - localized I've already told kind of my
64:43 - my wife's localization story we met in
64:45 - grad school um after several years we
64:47 - were able to get a visa for to come here
64:50 - and and because it took so long she
64:52 - immediately got her green card when she
64:53 - arrived in the US because she'd been
64:55 - she'd already like done the duration of
64:56 - like waiting for the green card um and
64:59 - then we just you know settled and
65:00 - eventually many years later uh she was
65:03 - eligible to apply for citizenship we
65:06 - went to the we went to this big thing in
65:08 - California like thousands of people big
65:10 - naturalization ceremony and and they
65:13 - they played this song I'm proud to be an
65:16 - American I can't remember like what it
65:18 - what it was but it's like some country
65:20 - song that everybody has to listen to
65:21 - when they when they get localized or
65:23 - naturalized um what was your did you go
65:25 - with your wife when she naturalized or
65:27 - how did that work so she was naturalized
65:30 - during Co so I wasn't able to go in with
65:32 - her which was which was a huge bummer so
65:34 - I don't know exactly I know they gave
65:36 - her a little American flag that she
65:37 - carried out um but yeah unfortunately I
65:39 - wasn't I wasn't able to enjoy that with
65:41 - her that was a bit of a bummer but um we
65:44 - you know went back home and celebrated
65:46 - um remember correctly we had like you
65:48 - know uh American flag desserts and stuff
65:51 - sitting around you know yeah it was it
65:54 - was it was a different time because of
65:56 - the because it was like mid pandemic
65:58 - yeah well you you've been able to go to
66:00 - Brazil uh and and in fact uh did you go
66:03 - to a conference there recently yeah uh
66:06 - so we usually try to go every year uh at
66:09 - least you know at least once a year and
66:11 - this year uh I just got back a couple
66:12 - weeks week or two ago from Brazil JSC
66:15 - and that was in uh Porto Brazil and you
66:19 - know unfortunately they're going through
66:20 - a pretty rough time right now um
66:23 - I which is very hard heartbreaking cuz
66:26 - it's such a beautiful Community down
66:27 - there um and to see that happen shortly
66:29 - after I after I left with this is this
66:31 - is the floods that are affecting Porto
66:33 - Allegre we have a team member in Porto
66:35 - Allegre fortunately he uh him and his
66:39 - family were not in like the path of the
66:41 - floods uh but um yeah we always call it
66:46 - happy Harbor because that's what it
66:47 - translates to in English and so we're
66:50 - like the Happy Harbor is not happy right
66:52 - now but they're going to be happy again
66:53 - soon uh so um by the time this airs
66:57 - hopefully everything like the waters
66:59 - have receded and everything like that
67:00 - but um yeah definitely uh hoping the
67:03 - best for everybody affected by that and
67:06 - you were just there you like flying out
67:08 - like days before the flooding started
67:11 - literally two days uh after we left uh
67:15 - the the terrible floods uh happened um
67:18 - we were we were there for so after
67:21 - Brazil JS comp we went to the city
67:23 - outside of Porto Le and um it was
67:25 - raining the entire time and raining
67:26 - decently hard the entire time and you
67:28 - know we were just thinking oh it's you
67:30 - know pretty bad rain it's long um and
67:32 - there was even like roads I I laughed
67:34 - sorry there was roads that were breaking
67:36 - on our path to get to that City when we
67:38 - were coming home so we were afraid just
67:39 - from that we weren't able to reach back
67:41 - to the city um but we made it back to
67:44 - the city and at that point there were no
67:46 - flooding issues that we were aware of um
67:48 - but then we heard two days later that
67:49 - all that was happening it's it's insane
67:52 - yeah well how how's your wife's family
67:54 - does she have family there so so she's
67:57 - not from there she's from a state called
67:59 - madise and uh so that was much more
68:02 - North and fortunately wasn't affected by
68:04 - any of that um but so yeah they're
68:05 - they're doing well yeah well um I'm glad
68:09 - that her family is unaffected and uh
68:12 - yeah definitely hope everything goes all
68:14 - right uh and that they're able to you
68:15 - know probably billions of dollars and
68:17 - damages and like lots of Life lost uh
68:20 - it's it's going to be a big process to
68:22 - recover um but but Daniel from our team
68:25 - you know his family's there uh you know
68:28 - they're they're doing everything they
68:29 - can to like power through that um yeah
68:32 - yeah well I wish everybody they're the
68:33 - best of luck you know yeah absolutely
68:36 - um one of the things that um I'm really
68:40 - impressed by about you is just like how
68:43 - wholesome and down toe you are like I
68:45 - don't think I've ever seen you not
68:48 - smiling and it makes sense that you'd be
68:50 - like a model for thinking and like
68:51 - you're always happy you're you know have
68:53 - you ever seen like that the nerd Parx or
68:55 - the geek Paradox it's like like the
68:57 - happiness for a typical person is like
68:59 - as highest at high school and then it
69:00 - starts to dip but the happiness for like
69:04 - you know a geek is like lowest in high
69:06 - school and then it just slowly climbs
69:08 - through their life okay yeah yeah
69:10 - because they they get to do what they
69:11 - love like they're not afraid of like
69:14 - Society calling them nerds or Geeks or
69:18 - whatever like like that it's almost like
69:20 - a badge of honor and I think nerd
69:22 - culture is one to the point that like
69:24 - basically I even hear the terms nerd or
69:26 - geek anymore like my kids like love
69:29 - computers and I've never heard any of
69:31 - the other kids like computers are nerdy
69:33 - right right right right yeah it's kind
69:35 - of like the Geeks one and now with with
69:37 - the internet there's so many different
69:38 - subcultures and everything everybody's
69:39 - into like different types of music and
69:41 - different different types of everything
69:43 - and it's it's fine like it's expected
69:45 - that everybody has different uh you know
69:48 - interest like very hyperfocused on
69:50 - specific things uh like people aren't
69:53 - ashamed to say that they are really
69:55 - interested in like bug collecting or
69:57 - something like that right whereas before
69:59 - it might be looked at as like what's
70:01 - wrong with your kid why doesn't he play
70:02 - on the football team you know right
70:03 - right yeah it's it's been amazing
70:06 - because I remember like it's funny just
70:08 - I connect thinky because of that culture
70:10 - but that was before like geek culture
70:13 - really exploded but then honestly around
70:15 - the time that they got bought by
70:17 - GameStop and you eventually they Sunset
70:19 - it like that's when that was that bubble
70:22 - was starting to grow because now all the
70:25 - the stores wanted to carry all your pop
70:26 - funkos and um now of course they're kind
70:29 - of oversold but uh that's when it was
70:31 - starting to grow and grow and grow and
70:33 - now we can see it all over and like we
70:34 - we think about the Marvel movies for
70:36 - instance like that was that's like if
70:39 - you go back like 10 years ago that's a
70:41 - super geeky thing um and now like
70:43 - everybody loves to go watch those movies
70:45 - and you know it's it's cool to be able
70:48 - to have that much content you know
70:50 - marvel maybe overdid it a little bit but
70:52 - um it's cool to have so much like
70:54 - amazing content like for the kind of
70:56 - Worlds that we love you know just freely
70:58 - available I mean like our kids will
71:00 - never have the experience of being
71:01 - ostracized because they're really into
71:03 - like Scandinavian death metal or
71:05 - something like that right it's just like
71:08 - everybody's into like whatever you know
71:10 - whatever you're into it's cool nobody
71:12 - cares right there's that there's that uh
71:14 - that web comic the guy is like he's like
71:16 - walking down the street he's all
71:17 - distraught he's like nobody gives a damn
71:19 - and then he stops and thinks for a
71:21 - second he's like nobody gives a damn
71:26 - right uh so cool man uh I'm so happy to
71:30 - be alive during this period where like
71:31 - there's not this Con force of Conformity
71:35 - because like you know I I grew up and
71:37 - I'd like listen to Rush and watch like
71:38 - the subdivisions uh you know music video
71:41 - from like 1982 or something like that
71:44 - great video that I was talking about uh
71:47 - with uh with Jessica Lord who grew up in
71:49 - subdivisions uh around I think around
71:52 - Chicago area like uh you know it used to
71:54 - be that like you had to conform and fit
71:56 - in and like there was pressure to drink
71:58 - alcohol and stuff like that and like my
72:00 - understanding is a lot of that is
72:01 - receding and there's just more General
72:03 - acceptance among kids and a lot of that
72:05 - kind of toxic you know Conformity
72:08 - culture is is like going away and
72:11 - amazing you're a new dad right like you
72:13 - you have a
72:14 - three-year-old yeah yeah he's going to
72:16 - be three in July and man it's it's been
72:19 - a wild ride he's I love him so much uh
72:22 - but it's definitely one of the biggest
72:24 - challenges I've had in my life life um
72:26 - but you know also one of the best things
72:28 - that's ever happened in my life so yeah
72:30 - it's been a fun balance and I've learned
72:32 - so much through this process tell me a
72:33 - little bit about him like like what is
72:35 - he into as a three-year-old yeah so uh
72:38 - he's wild uh going all around he loves
72:40 - to just kind of run around and play uh
72:43 - more recently he's uh done more of like
72:46 - the imaginative playing you know with
72:48 - the figures and stuff which I have a lot
72:49 - of fun watching him uh do um yeah I I he
72:54 - he likes trucks a lot right now so he
72:57 - has like a bunch of little uh like you
72:59 - know like a dumb truck uh I don't know
73:01 - all the different names of the trucks
73:02 - but um and cars and stuff so he's been
73:05 - playing around with those a lot
73:07 - yeah my kids uh were a little bit older
73:10 - my son six now and he loves making Mario
73:13 - Maker
73:14 - levels that's amazing yeah and he'll he
73:18 - he cuz for a while like it was like this
73:20 - he went through these phases where he's
73:21 - like he'd love to like borrow my phone
73:24 - and just like find real really hard
73:25 - Mario levels on YouTube like these you
73:27 - know wow people that like I guess stream
73:30 - Mario maker like several hours a week
73:32 - and extremely good like precisely timing
73:34 - their jumps and you know spin jumping
73:37 - off the piranha plants and everything
73:38 - and he would watch those and then
73:39 - eventually I got a Mario maker to and
73:42 - man he just went crazy with it like he
73:44 - built so many levels and uh I remember
73:46 - when like he uploaded his first level
73:48 - he's like wow and some kid liked his
73:52 - level and that was just like huge deal
73:55 - he was just like what somebody likeed My
73:57 - Level that's amazing and just like think
74:00 - about like the world we live in that you
74:01 - can do that right it's just so cool I
74:03 - mean you obviously you're wearing a
74:05 - Super Mario Brothers t-shirt uh with
74:07 - like a lot of the Sprites from the
74:08 - original uh uh NES game
74:11 - 1985 1986 or seven here in the US that
74:15 - it was released but like it's such an
74:17 - iconic game and uh you know you and I
74:21 - our gaming experience was very like one
74:23 - way it was like we consumed the game
74:24 - maybe we got really good at the game we
74:25 - could like you know get to like the the
74:28 - kill screen quote unquote kill screen on
74:30 - Tetris or something like that of course
74:31 - now we know that's not the kill screen
74:33 - and then people would just keep playing
74:34 - Forever Until the game literally like
74:37 - crashes uh it just it was called a kill
74:39 - screen because it got so hard that it
74:41 - was thought that you couldn't
74:42 - conceivably move the pieces over far
74:43 - enough and that you would just die um
74:46 - didn't a kid recently break the record
74:48 - for that within the last year yeah so so
74:50 - there was like something called like uh
74:52 - hypertapping which is where you just tap
74:54 - really fast and then somebody invented
74:56 - rolling cuz for Original Classic NES
74:59 - Tetris uh you have to play on the old
75:02 - NES controller the boxy one that like
75:04 - cuts into your palms and stuff not not
75:06 - the most ergonomic controller the most
75:07 - ergonomic controller is the N64
75:09 - controller but
75:11 - uh you uh actually I don't know that
75:13 - that's the case but like I always
75:14 - thought it was with the extra handles it
75:16 - was a really kind of freak of nature
75:18 - design thing to have like three
75:19 - different handles on it but that was
75:22 - definitely the most Innovative
75:23 - controller ever in my opinion but uh
75:25 - sorry for like the long tangent people
75:26 - who don't care about gaming they're like
75:27 - I want I want to learn to code what are
75:28 - you going to talk about how to get
75:29 - better at coding but classic NES Etc
75:33 - like so you hold it and you kind of like
75:35 - roll your fingers against the thing and
75:37 - like the number of rolls is how many
75:39 - times your finger will tap it so you can
75:41 - go Boop Bo Boop as long as you can as
75:43 - fast as you can like roll your fingers
75:45 - you can move that many spaces to the
75:47 - left or the right so you can move the
75:48 - piece around the piece well and uh get
75:52 - it oriented and and you can get some
75:53 - lines that way but people like these are
75:56 - young kids they're playing a game that
75:58 - was created you know 20 years before
76:01 - they were born in some cases um and
76:03 - they're just tearing it up and and kind
76:05 - of blow like who would have thought like
76:08 - but that game is probably played and the
76:10 - other game that's extremely optimized by
76:11 - speedrunners of course is Super Mario
76:13 - Brothers uh on NES to where they've got
76:16 - like these like frame rules like they
76:19 - they've dissected the co code and
76:21 - figured out like if you play perfectly
76:24 - and all this stuff you have to save like
76:26 - I think 13 frames for it to actually
76:27 - reduce the amount of time at the end of
76:29 - the level so people are trying to shave
76:30 - off frames and then they hit like some
76:32 - threshold oh we shaved off 14 frames so
76:35 - now we like saved a frame roll right
76:38 - right and like yeah it's incredible how
76:41 - I mean this is the level of geekiness
76:43 - that even you and I would probably be
76:44 - like whoa this guy's like really down
76:46 - the rabbit hole right with this with
76:49 - with like trying to shave a few
76:52 - milliseconds off of their Super Mario
76:54 - time but it's amazing though yeah and
76:56 - it's so interesting for me I love
76:58 - watching videos about speedrunners um my
77:01 - kids love watching like Games Done Quick
77:03 - and stuff like that and it it's just
77:06 - really really cool that we live in this
77:09 - like geek culture that the Geeks won and
77:11 - that now we have like this incredibly
77:13 - longtail form of entertainment and then
77:15 - we have distribution channels like like
77:19 - you and I would never be I guess
77:21 - compelling enough and down the middle of
77:23 - the road like interesting enough to
77:25 - enough people to be on like one of the
77:27 - big three you know networks from our
77:30 - parents generation right like used to be
77:32 - three TV channels right and how many
77:34 - channels are there on YouTube I don't
77:35 - know like hundreds of millions probably
77:37 - right each with their own special Niche
77:39 - so so like we are alive at a time when
77:43 - we can express and we can teach and we
77:44 - can find other people who have such ecle
77:47 - you know esoteric interests as ours and
77:49 - we can connect with them yeah yeah yeah
77:52 - so and I was thinking about like the the
77:54 - fact that K was watching the speedrun
77:55 - videos and like just that alone that's
77:57 - not something that we could have done
77:59 - when we were going up right like we
78:00 - didn't have speedrun videos to we didn't
78:02 - have maker videos to watch um like it's
78:04 - just a completely different world and
78:05 - it's it's amazing that we have all this
78:08 - um you know and being able
78:10 - to grow out into this community and meet
78:12 - people and have common things with
78:14 - everybody it's amazing time I mean the
78:16 - closest we got to that kind of thing was
78:18 - like probably magazines like egm next
78:20 - generation was a really cool one back in
78:22 - the day of course Nintendo Power with
78:24 - the iconic Super Mario 2 like clation
78:26 - thing on the cover of the first issue um
78:29 - I remember getting a couple walkthrough
78:30 - magazines for games that I was having a
78:32 - little bit of hard time with yeah and I
78:35 - you know I'd create Zen and some of my
78:36 - friends would create Zen like Zen being
78:38 - the shorten form of magazine which is a
78:40 - cool Arabic word that is a lone word
78:42 - into English oh um but we would create
78:45 - Zen and like go to the photoc cop here
78:46 - and publish them and pass them around at
78:48 - school and stuff and that was kind of
78:49 - how we shared our uh our esoteric
78:53 - interests um but now it's just super
78:55 - yeah like I put something on the
78:56 - Internet and like like I love Hot keys
79:00 - right I create like some article about
79:02 - how to use this very specific type of
79:04 - hotkeys in mac and like people just
79:06 - organically start seeing it because
79:07 - they're looking for something like that
79:09 - so it's pretty cool to be a Creator in
79:11 - 2025 for sure which next year this year
79:14 - is 2024 yeah yeah I'm getting ahead of
79:15 - myself I I was wondering this is going
79:17 - to be published next year
79:18 - right yeah so uh I have just like a
79:22 - bunch of Rapid Fire questions cuz uh I
79:24 - want to be mindful your time uh okay
79:27 - you're really into space like that like
79:29 - you got space jelly as your mascot first
79:32 - before we talk about space let's talk
79:34 - about space jelly yeah so um I I've just
79:38 - always loved and been gravitated to
79:41 - space like gravitated uh I just you know
79:43 - am amazed by it I think it's super cool
79:45 - and like I I always tell my wife like
79:47 - the one one of my buckless goals is to
79:49 - go to space and cuz I would imagine by
79:51 - the time I'm about to die like it's
79:52 - going to be cheap for just you know at
79:54 - least going up there and exploring she
79:55 - doesn't want to but I told her I'll I'll
79:57 - take my kid there uh but you know it's
80:00 - just I don't know I've always loved
80:01 - space and um I've always thought
80:03 - jellyfishes were cool too they just look
80:05 - really cool and the way that they're
80:07 - kind of in the the water I love kind of
80:09 - the colors that are associated with that
80:10 - like the purples and the blues and um so
80:13 - I I wanted to create some kind of
80:16 - character because I thought it was cool
80:17 - that like some of these uh content
80:19 - creators had a little character or
80:21 - something and I wanted my own uh just
80:23 - for fun so I asked my buddy uh who was a
80:25 - phenomenal illustrator uh to I to create
80:28 - one and of course I paid him for it um
80:30 - and I told him I I was pretty loose with
80:32 - what I won you know a jellyfish
80:34 - astronaut and he came up with uh the
80:38 - character and um that's kind of the the
80:40 - origin behind that and yeah I was super
80:42 - happy with what he came up with and
80:44 - thought it was really cool and and
80:45 - you've just run with it right that's
80:46 - your mascot yep yep create stickers you
80:50 - know I uh give them out to people
80:52 - whenever I go to conferences and uh try
80:54 - to do some giveaways every once in a
80:56 - while and and it's not something that
80:58 - I'm trying to like blow up into some
81:00 - huge brands or anything but like it's
81:02 - just I don't know it's it it makes me
81:04 - happy and you know I hope it makes other
81:05 - people happy and that's yeah well if you
81:08 - want to be really happy listen to the
81:09 - '90s band jellyfish they've got some
81:12 - I've never heard yeah really solid band
81:14 - they only had like two albums but
81:16 - they're like really creative and fun uh
81:20 - that's awesome yeah definitely check out
81:22 - uh their albums um and speaking of the
81:24 - fish though uh I I it was my birthdays
81:28 - but my wife got this custom created on
81:30 - uh Etsy which was just amazing yeah I
81:35 - object yeah yeah yeah it it's just
81:38 - amazing that they were able to come up
81:39 - with this and so I keep this on my desk
81:42 - as well well you are a hardcore plushy
81:45 - uh connoisseur and to have a plushy of
81:47 - your own personal mascot that's pretty
81:50 - awesome one day I want to create like a
81:52 - a rubber one I don't know if you know
81:53 - Jason Lang like
81:55 - he I want to create like something like
81:58 - this one day but you know one day yeah
82:00 - and Jason lorf uh interesting used to be
82:03 - in like an emo band and he he's a really
82:05 - really good guitarist like I listen to
82:07 - like a lot of his uh kind of like kind
82:09 - of punk emo music videos and stuff super
82:13 - chill dude that's aome I I've never
82:15 - heard any stuff I was in a band in high
82:17 - school but we we just played like a a
82:19 - graduation in the basement and like at a
82:21 - park once so we didn't really do
82:23 - anything but we recorded an album but
82:25 - yeah that's cool I would love to check
82:27 - it out if it's uh if you got it like
82:29 - archived anywhere dude I'm a digital
82:32 - packrat I have like every single thing
82:34 - I've done I have in my if you have a
82:36 - link to it I will include it in the show
82:38 - notes and people can check out your high
82:40 - school sounds good sounds good
82:44 - awesome uh I want to talk a little bit
82:47 - like practical tips because I don't want
82:49 - people to think like oh they just talked
82:50 - about you know Kobe and and quiny shared
82:52 - a bunch of personal anecdotes the whole
82:54 - time I want people to walk away some
82:55 - with some actual advice from having
82:57 - listened to this entire thing and um I'm
83:01 - really interested in like what knowing
83:04 - what you know about like your career
83:07 - progression from designer like let's say
83:09 - somebody is in the audience and they did
83:11 - go to design school or they're really
83:12 - interested in design but of course
83:14 - magazines are essentially over and even
83:17 - a lot of web design and stuff is kind of
83:19 - like solved is what I've had some
83:22 - designers describe it as is like there's
83:23 - kind of like a few op like there's just
83:26 - not the wide open decision space that
83:28 - there was in the U or design space that
83:31 - there was in the Myspace era where a
83:33 - website could look like anything now
83:35 - it's kind of like people have this
83:36 - expectation that it looks this way you
83:38 - got all these like domino people
83:39 - literally getting sued because their
83:41 - page wasn't accessible enough stuff like
83:43 - that like like what advice would you
83:45 - give to people interested in design or
83:47 - people who have design degrees who want
83:49 - to get into Tech and get like a a a
83:52 - knowledge worker type job job and have
83:55 - the uh you know relative uh stability
83:58 - and comfort that that sort of job
84:00 - provides them yeah that's a great
84:03 - question and like so I one thing that's
84:05 - interesting off of that is I kind of had
84:08 - to challenge the the notion of that
84:11 - everything actually does need to look
84:12 - the same way and I think that ends up
84:14 - happening I mean we've seen that with
84:15 - like design Trends all these startups
84:17 - now have websites that look the same but
84:19 - you know I think that we've become so
84:23 - practically oriented we've kind of lost
84:25 - touch of that kind of creative angle and
84:26 - you know sometimes you do see websites
84:28 - that do really amazing things but I
84:31 - think often what you'll see is that the
84:33 - usability isn't taken into consideration
84:36 - as much as it should be during that
84:37 - process so that's where we get into the
84:38 - situations where um they go to the site
84:41 - it's completely unusable the
84:42 - accessibility is not present at all um
84:45 - and that gives that kind of idea bad
84:47 - reputation but there's a lot of ways
84:49 - that we can get around that um and it's
84:51 - cool to see some of the like uh CSS grid
84:53 - work that's been uh going on and some of
84:55 - the demos I've seen that take advantage
84:57 - of a lot of the like typographic and uh
85:00 - layout design that you would
85:01 - traditionally see in some of these
85:02 - design schools um where all this is
85:05 - leading to is I really think that we do
85:08 - need to kind of bring more back of uh
85:10 - more of that traditional design back
85:12 - into the web design and um I I don't
85:14 - think I'm the one to do it I think I've
85:16 - lost a little of that edge but um I'd
85:18 - love to see designers really Embrace
85:20 - that and uh try to create their own uh
85:23 - expression um um to be able to create
85:26 - better experiences on the web yeah um so
85:29 - it's not solved it's in stagnant state
85:33 - but it's not a solved State and in fact
85:36 - it may never be solved because
85:38 - Aesthetics is subjective right yeah and
85:41 - like uh for sure and like I think we're
85:43 - going to keep going through those trends
85:45 - of the design like things that are more
85:47 - popularized than others um and I think
85:49 - something that might be like borderline
85:51 - solved is just more of the traditional
85:53 - ux pattern so um if you're showing a
85:56 - form like you want that form to look a
85:59 - certain way to make sure that people
86:01 - have their expectations for that form
86:02 - but that doesn't mean that the content
86:04 - and design around it can't be more
86:06 - expressive right um so that's why it's
86:08 - like the UI patterns as opposed to the
86:10 - the web design itself um is
86:12 - differentiating what you're trying to
86:15 - put in that bucket right yeah 100% so
86:18 - again like surprising people and
86:20 - delighting people is great when they're
86:22 - yeah you know learning about your
86:23 - product or something like that but but
86:24 - when they're trying to like input a
86:25 - credit card that's probably not the time
86:29 - to uh that needs to be precisely
86:31 - optimized you don't want to play around
86:33 - with that yeah yeah awesome uh I'm also
86:36 - interested in like where you see tools
86:39 - going with AI because of course Cloud
86:41 - Nary makes heavy use of AI and that's
86:43 - how they accomplish like at scale
86:46 - inexpensively uh like for pennies on
86:49 - fractions of pennies on the API call
86:51 - they they do this AI stuff like what are
86:54 - the immediate consequences of us having
86:57 - just profoundly better AI yeah so I kind
87:01 - of see two angles for this like from a
87:03 - perspective of where it's going um you I
87:06 - I've been saying this for a while that I
87:07 - think that people really try to just hop
87:10 - in the wagon and throw a chatbot
87:11 - wherever they can and you know while
87:13 - there's some value some people I don't
87:15 - think that that's going to ever be the
87:16 - future of AI like I think really it's
87:18 - how we can take the those tools and
87:20 - integrate it into our workflows so
87:22 - rather than having an assistant that
87:23 - gener a blog post rather writing a blog
87:26 - post and you have an assistant that
87:27 - helps you write write it so you know it
87:28 - gives you tips uh grammatical things and
87:30 - those kind of things um because to be
87:33 - honest like a lot of the times
87:34 - generative the generated content you can
87:37 - kind of tell that it's AI generated like
87:39 - it always has that that Vibe same with
87:41 - the videos like it always has that
87:42 - generated Vibe um so I encourage people
87:45 - to kind of think about it differently
87:46 - from a workflow perspective um now
87:48 - thinking about clowner specifically and
87:50 - this isn't intended to be a plug this is
87:52 - I cuz I just think it's really cool like
87:54 - I think that's where some of their
87:55 - products be AI products become
87:56 - compelling because things like uh being
87:58 - able to analyze an image and create
88:01 - captions or alt text from that image
88:04 - automatically using AI is very
88:06 - compelling because that's going to help
88:07 - a lot of people from an accessibility
88:08 - and SEO perspective um but it's not
88:11 - necessarily generating the image um it's
88:13 - analyzing it so that we can provide a
88:15 - more descriptive uh an easier way for
88:18 - more people to experience that uh who
88:20 - might not be able to visually um but
88:22 - those kind of things like I really think
88:23 - it's more workflow oriented and helping
88:25 - us become more productive not
88:27 - necessarily taking away the
88:29 - creation yeah and uh I do see it as like
88:33 - just a tool and and I don't like
88:35 - chatting with chat Bots and I I agree
88:37 - with you that like you know hey our our
88:40 - website now has a chat bot like
88:42 - technically they had like primitive
88:44 - chatbot like support things or like
88:46 - things that would stall while they got a
88:47 - real human on the horn maybe they don't
88:49 - actually need to get like a real human
88:51 - to like come in and tell you to uh that
88:53 - you signed into the wrong account or you
88:54 - accidentally created a duplicate account
88:56 - or something again I say that again
88:58 - because that's the most common support
88:59 - thing we have is like you deleted my
89:01 - progress I'm like no you probably off
89:04 - originally with your Google account and
89:06 - then you Au with like your GitHub
89:07 - account or something like that the
89:08 - emails didn't match up but uh you know
89:11 - like things to to address those kinds of
89:15 - uh common things um yeah I I can see AI
89:19 - doing so many little things like so
89:21 - interestingly um the have you ever seen
89:24 - the expanse I know you're a space fan I
89:27 - I'm like three quarters away through the
89:29 - first season um so depending on where
89:32 - you're referencing it may or may not so
89:34 - they asked the expans authors the the
89:37 - author team that like wrote the books
89:39 - that the the show is based off of by the
89:41 - way strongly recommend the expi it's
89:44 - probably the most accurate like uh in
89:48 - terms of physics and things like that
89:50 - like TV show we've gotten since like
89:51 - 2001 Space Odyssey um where like
89:54 - literally like they're up there trying
89:55 - to figure out what the Stars would look
89:56 - like from a specific position in space
89:59 - things like that right aming like yeah
90:01 - incredible attention to detail in 2001
90:03 - Space Odyssey but similar in the expanse
90:06 - now of course there's some kind of
90:07 - Fantastical elements and stuff as well
90:09 - but and a lot of hand wavy like oh we
90:11 - just have nuclear fusion it just works
90:13 - you but um but uh in the expanse like
90:18 - they ask the authors like where's the AI
90:20 - like wouldn't AI just be everywhere like
90:22 - why are people still doing all this
90:23 - stuff and they're like yeah tons of AI
90:24 - but it's invisible it's like whenever
90:26 - you see like a ship passing through like
90:28 - a tight passage or something you see all
90:30 - the the turs collapsing and like all
90:31 - that stuff like nobody on the ship has
90:33 - to tell it to do that stuff it's just
90:35 - like their perceptions uh on the ship
90:37 - the ship's monitoring all these
90:38 - different things and like of course like
90:40 - the ship robot and stuff just kind of
90:42 - like intrinsically can like diagnose
90:44 - radiation poisoning and stuff like that
90:45 - so like like you know the AI is there
90:49 - but it's not like it didn't
90:51 - fundamentally change society it just
90:53 - made things Al easier in a lot of very
90:55 - kind of like grab bag ways right and I
91:00 - mean I don't think about AI as like oh
91:03 - it's going to be able to you know make
91:04 - my image the exact right size and it's
91:06 - going to be able to you know make sure
91:08 - that it's the exact format that is the
91:09 - most efficient for this particular thing
91:11 - like a lot of very specific kind of
91:13 - problems that you don't even think about
91:15 - those are the ones that AI is probably
91:16 - going to solve you're probably still
91:18 - going to be sitting at a desk they like
91:19 - what am I going to write a tutorial
91:21 - about today you know right right right
91:23 - right for sure like I while I think that
91:26 - AI can will be able to practically solve
91:29 - things like it's still going to be a
91:31 - linear path for the AI to get there so
91:35 - there's a lot of problem solving that
91:36 - goes around that and a lot of contextual
91:38 - things that I don't think will'll ever
91:40 - not willever um that is just a little
91:43 - bit more difficult to solve and then you
91:44 - got to think about the upkeep from there
91:46 - like of course the can keep doing it
91:48 - maybe but um we're definitely not there
91:50 - yet I don't think we're going to be
91:51 - there for a while um so I I don't know
91:55 - it's just not something I'm personally
91:57 - worried about uh but I do think that
91:59 - people um should embrace it as a tool um
92:03 - personally I don't like using it too
92:05 - much but from people who are able to use
92:07 - it it makes them feel more productive so
92:09 - um if you're able to feel more
92:10 - productive uh no matter where you are at
92:12 - your career you know take advantage of
92:14 - that just be we that AI still is in a
92:16 - state that um it might have the
92:18 - hallucinations it might create code that
92:19 - doesn't work and stuff like that so um
92:22 - as long as you're kind of using it in
92:24 - skeptical way almost like it can really
92:27 - help you yeah yeah where it could get
92:29 - dangerous is if people just always
92:31 - assume that it's true or people start
92:33 - like factchecking each other with GPT
92:35 - and being like see you know yeah yeah
92:38 - that's why like I I really find it more
92:40 - compelling from the analysis side rather
92:42 - than the generative side yeah um where
92:45 - it's really trying to look at an
92:47 - enhancing your workflow as opposed to
92:48 - trying to take away your workflow yeah
92:52 - well what do you think um in terms of
92:55 - like specifically transitioning from
92:58 - developer uh you know Web Web Master it
93:01 - sounds like back in the day you were
93:02 - doing stuff like that uh doing doing uh
93:05 - visual design on websites and things
93:06 - like that like transitioning to a
93:08 - developer experience engineer how would
93:11 - somebody ultimately get your job if they
93:14 - uh wanted to work at like one of the
93:16 - literally thousands and thousands of De
93:19 - business to developer like Tech Tool
93:20 - type um companies out there yeah um so
93:25 - primarily like I think you need to have
93:27 - experience as an engineer and like I'm
93:28 - not trying to gatekeep or anything but
93:31 - um I I do think that having some
93:34 - experience actually working as an
93:36 - engineer or developer um actually
93:38 - solving problems is important to kind of
93:41 - uh give you a bit more context and maybe
93:43 - that's not working for a company maybe
93:44 - that's you doing your own Contracting uh
93:46 - building stuff but ultimately like
93:48 - having that experiences and you're
93:49 - building things helps you have that
93:51 - context and empathy and everything that
93:53 - goes into kind of understand how these
93:55 - uh pieces fit together why this really
93:58 - helps solve problems at scale uh that
94:01 - other tools might not those kind of
94:03 - things um from there I I created so much
94:07 - content like I um so it's still kind of
94:10 - that devil angle it's definitely not a
94:12 - requirement like some people try to come
94:14 - in only content creators some people
94:15 - come try to come in just as an engineer
94:17 - but um having that Balan and like
94:19 - anybody can publish a blog post these
94:21 - days you go to Hash node for instance
94:22 - like you were talking about earlier um
94:24 - like you just kind of got to get
94:25 - yourself out there start building in
94:27 - public um build things and that's
94:29 - probably the underlying thing build
94:31 - things um whether that's building your
94:33 - own portfolio site over and over like I
94:35 - did or it's you know building example
94:37 - clone sites uh like Google photos to try
94:40 - to build more experience it's ultimately
94:41 - about getting that experience uh working
94:44 - and talking about it yeah awesome that's
94:47 - a great note to end on just build things
94:49 - as kby said twice for emphasis like
94:51 - build your portfolio site over and over
94:54 - just keep retooling it keep uh you know
94:56 - customizing it over the years as time
94:58 - progresses and when you're including
95:00 - some additional you know portfolio
95:01 - pieces why not also update your
95:03 - portfolio to like make it look more
95:05 - contemporary you know get like glass
95:07 - amorphism in there or something I don't
95:08 - know right right yeah I mean your
95:10 - website is typically one of the lowest
95:13 - risk ways to be able to do that and have
95:15 - something that's actually in production
95:16 - right because like um people might come
95:18 - to read some of my blogs but like if
95:20 - somebody comes to a down site you know
95:22 - on some random Thursday like because I'm
95:24 - experimenting with some new uh tool like
95:27 - that's more beneficial for me that I'm
95:29 - learning that experience than um them
95:30 - having that downtime that I could later
95:32 - fix um so uh I I love to encourage
95:35 - people to do whatever they want over
95:37 - over engineer your personal blog over
95:40 - engineer your personal blog and as you
95:42 - said build clones and a great clone to
95:44 - start with of course uh just a just a
95:47 - reemphasize you've got this excellent
95:49 - course uh that we just published like a
95:51 - week or two ago uh how to build build a
95:54 - Google photos clone and it covers so
95:57 - many different things and it'll give you
95:58 - just tons of practical experience like
96:00 - taking an API integrating it and do you
96:03 - use nextjs what what uh what tools do
96:05 - you use for that yeah we're using nextjs
96:07 - for that one nextjs and just cloud like
96:10 - the amazing thing is you can do all this
96:11 - with just clown R yeah uh so again I'm
96:14 - going to link to that be sure to uh
96:16 - follow this guy his amazing YouTube
96:19 - channel where he's published so many
96:20 - tutorials over the past four or five
96:22 - years um and uh again I am having a
96:25 - blast learning from you and I'm so happy
96:29 - that like so many of the people in the
96:30 - space are just like these really chill
96:32 - down to earth accessible people cuz uh
96:35 - you know in a lot of Industries people
96:36 - are like I'm important you know like you
96:39 - approach them conference they're like
96:41 - I'm I'm too busy to talk to you you know
96:42 - like that is not the case generally in
96:45 - software development like people want to
96:47 - teach each other there's not this same
96:49 - kind of like fear of like this person
96:51 - could be like trying to like apply for
96:53 - my job six months from now or something
96:54 - like that right because there's still an
96:56 - abundance of opportunity out there even
96:57 - though it may feel like right now like
96:59 - nobody's hiring because the interest
97:00 - rates went up and companies are like
97:02 - trying to cut costs and stuff like it's
97:05 - going to come back and uh I'm optimistic
97:07 - that your approach of just being a chill
97:09 - human being whom people like you're a
97:12 - known quantity in the community you're
97:14 - probably always going to have a job
97:16 - right like you're probably always going
97:17 - to be able to go find another good
97:19 - developer role uh you know if if you
97:22 - need to and and yeah yeah that is very
97:25 - much the way to be like I definitely
97:27 - look to you and I look to your kind of
97:29 - uh just cheerfulness and and your just
97:32 - general kindness and like you're
97:35 - unabashed like this is who I am you know
97:38 - I love that about you so I'm so cool
97:40 - that other people in the community that
97:41 - that we had this opportunity to sit down
97:43 - with you uh and like learn a little bit
97:45 - more about what makes Kobe fak tick yeah
97:49 - and thank you so much it's been an
97:51 - absolute pleasure it's always a pleasure
97:52 - to chat in with you but uh this was a
97:54 - good time well everybody until next week
97:57 - happy coding happy coding
