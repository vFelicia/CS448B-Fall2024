00:12 - hello
00:13 - hello
00:14 - hi
00:15 - thank you for the lovely introduction
00:16 - and thank you to the sponsors as well
00:18 - um
00:20 - so yeah uh
00:22 - i can click
00:24 - that's not my slides
00:35 - um
00:37 - yeah so my name is nikki i'm a technical
00:39 - manager at a company called futurelearn
00:40 - we're transforming access to education
00:43 - online
00:44 - and before i was a technical manager
00:46 - i've been a web developer for a long
00:48 - long time more than a decade as saren
00:50 - said i don't want to tell you how many
00:52 - how much more
00:54 - um but i'm definitely on the developer
00:55 - end of the sort of designer developer
00:57 - skill set i've got an appreciation for
00:59 - design i don't think you can work very
01:01 - long in this industry and without having
01:03 - that but i'm not a designer so i have to
01:05 - work really closely with designers to
01:07 - ship the products that we build
01:09 - i can't do it on my own
01:11 - so i've sort of developed this really
01:12 - keen interest in understanding and
01:14 - helping developers and designers work
01:15 - together more closely and effectively
01:18 - so this talk is about one way of doing
01:20 - that
01:20 - so today i want to talk to you about
01:22 - developers and designers who want to
01:23 - push their imaginations to the limit and
01:25 - push the web to its limits i'm going to
01:27 - talk about how one of our most used
01:28 - solutions this grid full sort of layout
01:30 - that we always fall back to has served
01:32 - us really well for a really long time
01:34 - but
01:35 - the world has also moved on and so can
01:36 - we
01:38 - so this is what we're going to cover web
01:40 - design is getting boring i always feel a
01:42 - bit like i'm putting myself out there
01:43 - when i say that um
01:45 - it's a bold statement and i always like
01:47 - to say as well hashtag not all websites
01:49 - the js oxford website is really good uh
01:52 - really usable i love the little timeline
01:54 - of the events that are happening today
01:56 - um so we're just going to look at a bit
01:58 - of the history and a bit of a context to
01:59 - look back to look forward
02:01 - and then some final things that uh oh
02:03 - practical tips of course sorry the
02:04 - reason you're all here you skipped over
02:06 - the middle bit uh and there's some
02:08 - finally some sort of uh things that i
02:10 - stumbled upon when i was doing some of
02:12 - this work and things to look out for
02:14 - so let's start by going back
02:16 - why even grids what is the point of them
02:19 - we've all been using grids and building
02:21 - them for
02:22 - some time online and offline
02:25 - so why are they the go-to tool for sort
02:28 - of page layout
02:30 - to answer that question we need to go
02:31 - way back this is the pyramid texts
02:34 - it's dated to around 2300 bc
02:38 - and it's the first example of human
02:39 - writing like human communication i could
02:41 - find online it still kind of blows my
02:43 - mind that uh
02:45 - humans existed 3 000 years ago and we
02:47 - were trying to communicate with each
02:49 - other when we wrote this stuff down and
02:50 - i can find it on the internet and show
02:52 - it to you uh we can see what they wrote
02:55 - this is so cool
02:57 - but i would like you to know i think
02:58 - this is a one column layout
03:03 - a lot of columns but
03:05 - it's all one one column
03:09 - a few thousand years later five six
03:11 - eight a d this is the birmingham
03:13 - birmingham curan manuscript again like
03:16 - beautiful stunning i can't believe we
03:17 - have access to this kind of stuff
03:19 - still one column this is page one this
03:22 - is page two
03:25 - finally 808 a.d
03:28 - we finally get three thousand years
03:30 - after sort of chipping away on those
03:32 - stone walls we get to the two column
03:34 - layout
03:35 - well done humans
03:39 - and i think the benefit that you can see
03:41 - immediately here is that there's a lot
03:43 - more information on this page it's a lot
03:44 - more dense this is a medieval manuscript
03:47 - text and you can see the benefit already
03:51 - um
03:51 - [Music]
03:52 - this is the sort of marginalia that came
03:54 - a lot later than the original text of
03:55 - the book and
03:57 - somebody's been able to sort of start
03:58 - relating um
04:00 - sort of arranging related concepts next
04:02 - to each other
04:05 - they can be separate but they can still
04:06 - be connected to the main text that they
04:08 - refer to
04:10 - in the early 20th century the art
04:12 - movement exploded the grid system itself
04:15 - was named uh this is a book called grid
04:18 - systems in graphic design
04:20 - and that movement sort of exploded and
04:22 - flourished and this starts to look a lot
04:24 - more similar to the kind of modular
04:26 - component systems that we use today
04:30 - massimo vignelli designed this uni grid
04:32 - in 1970 something
04:35 - for exactly that purpose so that the
04:37 - output the products that this grid was
04:39 - used to create
04:40 - were more consistent but easier to
04:43 - create and easier to reproduce and
04:45 - quicker
04:47 - and
04:49 - this still helps the national park
04:50 - cartographers today they use the unigrid
04:52 - to design the maps for the park keep
04:55 - their layouts readable make sure that
04:57 - one element is not over balancing
04:58 - another
04:59 - and this has a practical benefit as well
05:02 - looking at this it just looks really
05:04 - good
05:07 - that's useful because it helps it make
05:09 - sure that people when they're looking at
05:11 - the maps around the park they're more
05:13 - likely to stay looking at the maps for a
05:14 - longer time
05:16 - and hopefully absorb more of the
05:17 - information they need to stay safe and
05:19 - have a good time it helps get their
05:21 - message across
05:23 - but there are some bad examples of using
05:25 - grids too
05:27 - like this
05:32 - so this tweet is from more than two
05:34 - years ago now
05:35 - i don't think a huge amount has changed
05:37 - um i'm really sorry to kind of keep
05:39 - bringing up this example because it is a
05:41 - little bit snarky i know
05:43 - and but i think it just does show that
05:44 - you know you can take without relying on
05:46 - this grid too far this can be a problem
05:49 - and i'm not knocking it the reason we do
05:51 - this is because on many levels it works
05:53 - it's modular it's easy to reproduce if
05:56 - you use the uni grid it makes the maps
05:57 - really look really good and you know
05:59 - make sure that you take that information
06:00 - and stay safe in the park
06:02 - but it's also really boring
06:05 - you look at this and you can see the
06:06 - clues in the name it's called the css
06:08 - box model you can have the margin on the
06:10 - inside or the outside but it makes boxes
06:12 - you know they're they're all the same
06:14 - shape
06:15 - communication and design is this kind of
06:17 - human impulse we've been trying to do it
06:18 - for 3000 years
06:21 - it has this kind of long and rich
06:22 - history and i think it's a shame that we
06:25 - don't make more use of it
06:27 - and then things like this no problem
06:31 - it's really good that you can go on
06:33 - squarespace and get yourself a website
06:34 - now anyone can do that fantastic
06:36 - but again we're starting to lose the
06:38 - benefits of this kind of 3 000 year old
06:40 - history of communication and design when
06:42 - everything starts looking so samey and
06:44 - sort of off the shelf
06:46 - and you run the risk of not getting your
06:48 - message across as effectively as you
06:49 - could
06:51 - so the only reason i'm really even
06:52 - giving this talk is that um through like
06:54 - many conversations over many years with
06:56 - friends designer friends and developer
06:58 - friends of mine at work and they say hey
07:00 - we've got this box we've made this
07:02 - layout you know what can you do to make
07:03 - it look a bit more interesting and for
07:05 - the last 10 years all i've been able to
07:07 - really say is well i could put rounded
07:09 - corners on it
07:11 - it's not very satisfying nobody's really
07:13 - pleased with that answer
07:14 - and the only reason we even have the
07:16 - ability to put images and um use css in
07:19 - browsers is because designers got
07:20 - frustrated and they wanted to add color
07:23 - and they wanted to use layout and use
07:24 - fonts and not be restricted it doesn't
07:27 - have to be just rounded corners let's
07:28 - think of it bigger
07:31 - so i'm not the only one who thinks this
07:33 - this is jen simmons she's amazing she's
07:35 - like one of my heroes
07:37 - she
07:38 - said this during a video discussion at
07:40 - ballista park last year
07:42 - she's one of the people who's doing
07:43 - really amazing work in kind of improving
07:46 - graphic design on the web and improving
07:48 - typographical design on the web she just
07:50 - she's a designer and developer advocate
07:52 - at mozilla and a member of the css
07:54 - working group and she's really pushing
07:56 - this idea
07:57 - um
07:58 - not just by doing talks and by sort of
08:00 - telling people about it but actually
08:01 - working with the people who are kind of
08:02 - implementing this stuff to make the web
08:04 - better
08:06 - then she said this
08:08 - we're copying each other's work too much
08:09 - too many things look like medium too
08:11 - many things look like web design out of
08:13 - 2007
08:14 - ah that's 10 years ago
08:17 - too many things look like copies of each
08:18 - other everybody's bored
08:21 - so there is a way to make design better
08:22 - on the web
08:23 - it's that way apparently so once i
08:26 - started thinking about this it was in my
08:28 - mind i just started seeing it everywhere
08:32 - these are examples of graphic designers
08:34 - sort of pushing the boundaries of their
08:35 - layouts and you can do really
08:36 - interesting things like this kind of
08:39 - the line of text following the dress all
08:41 - this really striking art direction that
08:43 - kind of really draws you in and makes
08:45 - you want to read the article i know we
08:47 - don't need enough of that with like
08:48 - clickbait headlines and stuff but you
08:50 - know
08:51 - i think this is much
08:52 - nicer these were all from the same issue
08:55 - of one magazine somebody there really
08:57 - likes this style
08:59 - but the point of all these examples is
09:01 - that like print can do this and
09:04 - for decades we've been saying you know
09:05 - the web is not print and that's true it
09:07 - isn't we shouldn't try and make things
09:08 - all exactly the same but if we have
09:11 - the
09:12 - technological ability now to do it in a
09:14 - sort of inclusive accessible practical
09:16 - scalable way then i think that we should
09:18 - be taking advantage of that
09:21 - so if we did want to do something a bit
09:22 - more interesting like this and we didn't
09:24 - have css shapes how could we do it have
09:27 - we done it in the past
09:29 - well i'm sure you're familiar with this
09:31 - you could go super old school just blind
09:33 - all the text in an image i'm sure you
09:35 - know all the reasons why this is a
09:36 - terrible idea
09:37 - um
09:39 - i think that a lot of web comics are
09:40 - still published like this uh which i
09:42 - think is a real opportunity for somebody
09:45 - out there a really interesting industry
09:47 - that would really benefit it would be
09:48 - really great if someone came along and
09:50 - sort of gave publishers more options for
09:51 - doing this kind of stuff and make them
09:52 - available to a much wider audience
09:55 - if you didn't want to put all your text
09:57 - in just one image you could have every
09:58 - line of text kind of positioned you know
10:01 - manually with spans and paragraphs
10:03 - with javascript
10:05 - is still not particularly maintainable
10:07 - or scalable or accessible maybe
10:09 - performant
10:11 - there's probably lots of other ways that
10:12 - you can think of as well that aren't
10:13 - great
10:14 - so that's kind of
10:16 - where we're at before css shapes like
10:18 - the kind of current state of the art
10:20 - i think you can tell where i'm going
10:22 - with this
10:22 - let's get away from these boring
10:24 - rectangles we're stuck in our old ways
10:26 - are stuck on these grids but actually
10:27 - there's something that can make things a
10:28 - lot more interesting for us and a lot
10:29 - better
10:32 - grids are great for all those reasons
10:33 - like legibility white balance space you
10:35 - don't have to lose any of that
10:37 - but once you understand those rules and
10:39 - you've put the time in to learn how and
10:41 - why they work and you have the
10:42 - foundations and you know why it's like
10:44 - this then you can break the rules so you
10:45 - can break out of the grid
10:48 - and there is a way to do that hurry
10:51 - so we're on to the practical tips
10:54 - section
10:55 - and the first thing i'd like to talk to
10:56 - you about is shape outside
10:58 - shape outside applied to an element
11:01 - makes the text flow around that element
11:04 - in the shape that you've chosen
11:05 - hopefully quite obviously named we're
11:07 - going to get into some examples in a
11:08 - minute
11:09 - the caveat on this at the moment the
11:11 - shape the element your shape floating
11:13 - around must be shaped
11:15 - the element must have must be floated so
11:19 - apparently just by that today that might
11:20 - change they may be like fixing that up
11:22 - in the spec don't know when
11:25 - random rumors in gossip
11:28 - and the element must also have shape
11:30 - height and width so it must have layout
11:33 - so we're just going to be covering the
11:34 - top three values today
11:36 - i couldn't i had to sort of play around
11:37 - with it and i couldn't do anything with
11:39 - insert that you can't already do with
11:40 - floats so i don't think that's
11:41 - particularly interesting if you want to
11:43 - have a go and have a play then you
11:44 - should
11:45 - an ellipse i think is like a type of
11:46 - circle i told you i wasn't a designer
11:50 - i got some raised eyebrows with my when
11:52 - i was doing this work with a runty of my
11:54 - designer sort of colleague but i'm
11:56 - sticking to it
11:58 - um
11:59 - so let's have a look at shape outside
12:01 - circle
12:03 - hopefully this is unsurprising to you
12:04 - but it aligns text around a circle
12:06 - these properties are all very wrong seal
12:08 - they do what they say on the tin
12:10 - so this is what it looks like
12:12 - um
12:13 - this is a very simple example
12:15 - if you want to have this kind of red dot
12:17 - layout you can do it however you like
12:19 - and then you just have this kind of one
12:21 - liner to get for things are lining
12:23 - around the
12:24 - the
12:26 - shape it's really nice really simple
12:27 - really easy
12:30 - and if shape outside is not supported
12:31 - you just get your standard sort of
12:33 - rectangle boxy text that you always had
12:35 - before you haven't impacted your
12:36 - accessibility or your readability
12:40 - that's circles easy right
12:43 - polygons
12:44 - so the simplest example of a polygon is
12:46 - a triangle this is what it looks like
12:48 - again this is like really simple
12:50 - examples you can set this up however you
12:52 - like i've done it like this
12:53 - and you just have this one liner again
12:55 - to add the shape to the property to kind
12:58 - of get this nice alignment
13:00 - um
13:01 - but you can see that this is like a
13:03 - little bit more complicated you actually
13:04 - have to plot your points now we can't
13:06 - just say oh it's a circle or it's a
13:07 - square i guess if it was insert or
13:09 - whatever
13:10 - it's
13:11 - getting a little bit more complicated
13:13 - again if it's not supported doesn't
13:14 - matter it just falls back great easy
13:18 - another example of a polygon
13:20 - this is um got the corner cut off
13:23 - and again you can see when i'm starting
13:26 - to make this shape i've had to sort of
13:27 - plot an extra point to kind of figure
13:28 - out like where i want the text to kind
13:30 - of go
13:31 - so it's starting to look a little bit
13:32 - more complicated now like oh i've got to
13:34 - keep all these numbers in my head if i
13:35 - want a more complicated shape than a
13:37 - square with a corner curve like what do
13:38 - i do
13:41 - i guess worse right
13:43 - so i didn't have the space to put all of
13:46 - the points on but it like basically goes
13:47 - like over the other side of the room
13:50 - um polygons can have infinite points i
13:52 - think
13:53 - uh so it starts to look a bit more scary
13:56 - and it starts to look like a bit of a
13:57 - pain in the ass and a bit of a barrier
14:00 - to entry
14:01 - like if i have to do all this work
14:03 - i might not be bothered like how can i
14:05 - convince my designer colleagues to help
14:07 - me with this
14:08 - so we're very lucky that a whole bunch
14:09 - of people have done a whole bunch of
14:11 - good work to make this a lot easier
14:13 - and there are some tools to help us make
14:14 - these shapes
14:16 - so
14:17 - i have a video i don't have any sound
14:19 - for this hopefully this is okay um this
14:21 - is firefox nightly but this tool has
14:24 - just landed in firefox i think so
14:25 - everybody has access to this now
14:27 - so i've got my dev tools open
14:31 - and i'm going to go and select the
14:33 - element that has the vape applied to it
14:35 - which is the cat
14:37 - and then when i do that i'm sorry it's
14:38 - so small
14:39 - um you start getting these kind of rules
14:41 - out here and there's a tiny little
14:43 - button next to the shape outside and if
14:45 - i click on it i can see the points that
14:46 - i've got oh my god this blew my mind
14:49 - when i first saw it
14:50 - look mom i'm a designer amazing
14:54 - so the lovely thing about this is that
14:56 - everything updates in real time here so
14:57 - once you've kind of sat and played about
14:59 - that and made it how you want you can
15:01 - just copy those over and straight into
15:02 - your code
15:05 - these tools also are not just for
15:07 - shape outside i think there's like a
15:08 - grid editor in there as well if you want
15:10 - to do css grid um
15:12 - and i think yeah this is just from
15:13 - flatfox so yeah go and have a play with
15:16 - that because it's amazing the power of
15:18 - the browser now is just phenomenal
15:21 - uh if you don't like firefox there's an
15:23 - editor for chrome as well
15:25 - it works in very similar way um i don't
15:28 - know if this one has grid i think it
15:29 - might be just shapes
15:31 - but yeah it does kind of the same sort
15:32 - of thing and you can kind of pick your
15:33 - points up and move them around
15:36 - so
15:37 - that's it for
15:38 - css shape polygon shape outside polygons
15:43 - but i found when i was doing this and
15:44 - sort of playing and making up some
15:45 - examples even with these tools um i was
15:48 - still finding there's like a little bit
15:49 - of extra work that sometimes i don't
15:51 - know if i can really be bothered to do
15:53 - so there's one last value i wanted to
15:55 - tell you about was shape outside which
15:56 - again like completely blew my mind when
15:58 - i found out about it it's just the
15:59 - cleverest thing i've ever seen
16:01 - um
16:02 - and that is the url value
16:04 - so this is a kind of similar layout to
16:06 - the one we had before with the cat um
16:09 - same effect as before but way less code
16:12 - this time we're not going to set all of
16:14 - our points out directly or play in a
16:16 - browser with it or anything like that
16:18 - but we're still going to get this oh no
16:20 - double click but we're still going to
16:21 - get the same effect oh the magic is rude
16:24 - uh you use a transparent image and it
16:25 - picks up on the alpha channel
16:27 - so you need a transparent png or a
16:29 - transparent svg it also works with both
16:32 - of those
16:34 - and you just pop your url to your image
16:36 - in there
16:37 - and there's this new
16:39 - property the shape image threshold uh so
16:42 - 0.5 there means all the pixels that are
16:44 - more than 50 transparent are the ones
16:47 - that it will kind of pick up on and flow
16:49 - around so i found this
16:52 - this is a way more
16:53 - common use case i think in my
16:56 - experience anyway that you'll be
16:57 - aligning text around an image rather
16:58 - than just a random shape so you may as
17:00 - well have the browser do all the work
17:02 - for you i think
17:06 - um especially because you've already had
17:08 - to do the work to like prepare the image
17:09 - right somebody's had to go
17:12 - transparent out the bits they don't want
17:14 - or what have you so you've already done
17:15 - that work you may as well use it rather
17:17 - than duplicate it all in your points
17:19 - um
17:20 - so that's all about shape outside
17:23 - let's have a look at browser support how
17:25 - real is this like when can i actually
17:26 - use it
17:28 - so okay it's not too bad uh just coming
17:32 - in firefox which is great i'm very
17:34 - excited about that edge under
17:36 - consideration good okay um never gonna
17:39 - be an ie okay well
17:41 - like over time that's not gonna become
17:43 - less of a problem
17:44 - um so yeah it's not supported in all the
17:48 - browsers so we do have to be a little
17:49 - bit careful about how we're using it and
17:50 - sort of think about our progressive
17:52 - enhancement and uh sort of consider our
17:54 - fallbacks
17:57 - but i say only you know consider the
17:58 - fallbacks the great thing about this is
18:00 - that
18:00 - this is fine you know um it's a
18:03 - one-liner
18:05 - it doesn't impact your performance to
18:06 - add it it looks really good if you don't
18:07 - have it it still looks really good
18:10 - this is the sort of thing to watch out
18:11 - for just kind of thinking through
18:14 - all the cases and what might happen if
18:15 - things aren't supported
18:17 - so that's it for css shapes
18:19 - we have some friends who also want to
18:21 - come and play
18:22 - css clipping
18:24 - so you might be familiar with some of
18:25 - this it works i think the kind of same
18:27 - way that it does like photoshop or
18:29 - sketch or one of those editors using a
18:31 - path to draw a shape and then the things
18:33 - inside the path are visible and the
18:34 - things outside aren't
18:36 - let's look at some examples um before we
18:39 - go on to those the syntax is exactly the
18:41 - same as cnss shapes i love that they've
18:43 - done this i think this is really clever
18:45 - barrier to entry again
18:47 - um these
18:48 - names these shapes are called the basic
18:50 - shapes uh in the sort of geometry spec
18:53 - of browsers slightly confusing css
18:55 - shapes basic shapes but you know once
18:57 - you've got your head around it it's
18:58 - great you can just use them for
18:59 - everything um very helpful
19:03 - so this is the kind of thing that you
19:04 - can do
19:05 - and again like i did this in the browser
19:06 - tools i'm just kind of playing and
19:07 - dragging things around
19:10 - worth noting before we dive in i think
19:12 - as well um
19:16 - the
19:18 - clip path works on svgs as well as html
19:20 - elements so i'm just using it on an
19:22 - image here or any other element you
19:23 - could do
19:25 - but they do work on svg as well
19:27 - so i'm sure you can imagine the kind of
19:29 - things that you could do with this all
19:30 - kinds of you know different shapes this
19:32 - is really simple again and you don't
19:34 - have to prepare your images you just do
19:36 - it all in the browser a lot of times
19:37 - when i've been doing this kind of thing
19:39 - with designers it's been like quite a
19:41 - round trip and a lot of back and forth
19:43 - like they'll make an image and then i
19:45 - upload it and then we look at it and
19:46 - it's not quite right and then they say
19:48 - okay well give me another image and then
19:49 - i upload it and then look it's still not
19:51 - quite right so but with this you just
19:52 - like sit and play with the points in the
19:55 - browser and it's just so much quicker
19:57 - giving designers a lot more control over
19:59 - the sort of end result i think a lot
20:01 - quicker as well
20:03 - um
20:05 - so this is a real world example of clip
20:07 - path this is the website that i work for
20:09 - futurelearn
20:10 - um this is what the amazing learner
20:12 - growth team used to build a new module
20:14 - for the home page which is that top kind
20:16 - of banner aspect
20:18 - and they wanted the uh steps we call
20:21 - them the future length steps to kind of
20:22 - wiggle down between those images
20:24 - sometimes also reflected on our branding
20:26 - although not apparently on this slide um
20:32 - so that's nice we like that um
20:35 - this is how it looks on mobile
20:37 - um all of this stuff like css clip path
20:40 - and also css shapes uses any css unit so
20:43 - it can be responsive i think they use
20:44 - calc and
20:47 - percentages to make this work
20:49 - rems m's whatever you like whatever
20:50 - works for your sort of situation
20:53 - and again it's a one-liner you have to
20:54 - kind of work out your points and we have
20:56 - this sort of slightly complicated design
20:58 - so we did that and we were happy to do
20:59 - that
21:00 - i think we did a mock-up in like codepen
21:02 - or something to kind of prove the
21:03 - concept
21:04 - but because we did the shaping the code
21:06 - we didn't have to go back and forth with
21:07 - the images constantly
21:09 - it's quite nice time saver
21:11 - and again we were quite happy with this
21:13 - fallback of just the straight line so
21:15 - this is like edge
21:16 - something that it doesn't have
21:19 - so
21:20 - that's click path on html elements i'm
21:22 - sure you're going to see more of this
21:23 - later but it gets really exciting when
21:25 - you start putting svg into the mix with
21:27 - clip path
21:29 - um svg is just xml right so you can put
21:32 - text nodes in it you can start doing
21:33 - stuff like this that's an image behind
21:36 - the text i just think this is very
21:38 - exciting i'd love to see people kind of
21:40 - doing more kind of interesting layouts
21:42 - and interesting headers and interesting
21:43 - text with this kind of stuff
21:45 - um
21:46 - because it's svg as well you could have
21:48 - multiple nodes inside so you could have
21:50 - um you know multiple kind of windows
21:52 - onto one image i sort of had this idea
21:55 - that
21:56 - you that might be quite performing if
21:57 - you have like a big image with different
21:59 - windows on it into different areas i'm
22:00 - not entirely sure if that would work but
22:02 - it sounds like a good idea
22:04 - um
22:05 - let's look at browser support for
22:06 - clipbar
22:08 - a lot better this is good um worth
22:11 - noting again this is for html uh clip
22:14 - path on svg works pretty much anywhere
22:16 - that svg is supported so pretty much
22:18 - everywhere but again
22:19 - you know looking through your fallbacks
22:21 - making sure that your progressive
22:22 - enhancement is you know you've thought
22:23 - about all the cases
22:27 - so that's it for practical tips
22:29 - there's a few final thoughts that i had
22:31 - while i was working on this stuff and
22:32 - while the team were working on the
22:33 - homepage module things that i think are
22:35 - just important takeaways to kind of
22:36 - remember
22:38 - so the first thing i think is really
22:40 - important is that all of this stuff not
22:42 - just css shapes and clip paths but like
22:44 - anything that you're using that isn't
22:45 - supported everywhere it's like it's not
22:47 - all or nothing
22:48 - just because some of this stuff is not
22:49 - supported in every browser it doesn't
22:51 - mean you can't use it it just means that
22:53 - you can be a bit cleverer about how you
22:55 - design it and how how we build it and
22:58 - there's a nice tool that can help us do
22:59 - this
23:01 - so
23:02 - what do you do if you've made a really
23:04 - nice design but it's a little bit more
23:06 - complicated than this these are really
23:08 - simple examples on purpose to sort of
23:10 - help build up our understanding um how
23:13 - these things work
23:14 - yeah i did that on purpose triangles and
23:17 - circles yeah they look really good but
23:19 - actually
23:20 - you know in my team in my production
23:22 - website uh it's going to be a little bit
23:24 - more complicated
23:26 - um so going back to the example that i
23:27 - showed you earlier this is what we
23:29 - wanted to build and we were quite happy
23:31 - with this fallback
23:33 - when i showed you this example before
23:34 - actually i was again simplifying it
23:37 - um there's something wrong with this
23:38 - picture
23:39 - uh very subtly wrong but we were not
23:41 - happy with this fallback as it stands
23:46 - if you um
23:48 - if you look at it in the browser or you
23:49 - have the eye for it you can see that
23:51 - it's not perfectly symmetrical and this
23:53 - is a problem
23:55 - we weren't actually happy with this the
23:56 - first time that we did it
23:58 - so we added some margin so that they do
24:00 - actually line up great
24:02 - but now we don't want the margin if the
24:05 - clip path is applied oh like i'm
24:07 - starting to get really confused
24:10 - it's okay we can get back to this
24:12 - we just reset the margin inside a
24:14 - feature query so there's a new thing you
24:16 - might have heard about it the supports
24:17 - keyword
24:18 - we say if click path is supported then
24:21 - we take away that margin that we added
24:23 - for when it isn't supported
24:24 - and again like it's really simple it's
24:26 - like two lines um it works a lot like
24:29 - the media query
24:30 - syntax is very similar
24:32 - um
24:33 - and i just wanted to reiterate as well
24:35 - after saying all of that you don't have
24:36 - to do this um
24:39 - if you're happy with a sort of slightly
24:40 - if unsymmetrical fallback then that's
24:42 - completely fine if you need to do some
24:44 - shenanigans and resetting and overriding
24:46 - then you can just include those in that
24:47 - supports block and
24:49 - that's fine too your fallback won't be
24:50 - affected
24:52 - the important thing to note here is that
24:54 - yeah in all those other examples the
24:55 - circle the triangle it was fine we don't
24:57 - have to do it it just defaults back to a
24:59 - rectangle the supports keyword is for
25:01 - more when you're in a slightly more like
25:03 - complicated real life situation and you
25:04 - want to finesse the detail you only have
25:06 - to use support so the natural fallback
25:08 - you know is something you're not happy
25:09 - with
25:12 - so next up
25:13 - building on that i suppose is to say
25:15 - like this can be a bold statement and a
25:17 - bold layout on something like you're
25:18 - thinking really big or it can just be a
25:20 - really small enhancement
25:23 - but the important thing to remember with
25:24 - all of these things is to remember those
25:26 - kind of inclusive design patterns
25:28 - so this is from a real website an
25:30 - example in the world
25:31 - and
25:33 - one thing i wanted to highlight here is
25:35 - that all of the sort of real world
25:37 - examples that i've seen
25:38 - have the ragged edge of the text on the
25:42 - right hand side and not the left
25:44 - and that's really important in left to
25:45 - right languages reading from ragged
25:47 - edges on the starting end of the line is
25:50 - really difficult
25:51 - your eye can't like sort of go back to
25:53 - the line and find it even more difficult
25:55 - if you have dyslexia or anything else
25:57 - that sort of makes it harder for you to
25:58 - read but it's difficult for anybody so
26:00 - don't do that
26:03 - the final thing i wanted to say
26:05 - was this kind of yeah use it or lose it
26:08 - i guess
26:09 - um
26:10 - this looks a bit dry and it is this is
26:13 - the spec for css shapes i'm not really
26:15 - recommending that you like go and read
26:16 - it um but i think it is kind of
26:18 - important to keep an eye on stuff like
26:19 - this i guess that's why we're all here
26:20 - tonight um follow jem simmons follow
26:23 - rachel andrews who's also writing about
26:25 - css grid and other shape stuff at the
26:27 - moment follow a few other people who are
26:28 - writing about this kind of stuff because
26:30 - if we don't use it the browser
26:31 - implementers will just think that we
26:33 - don't want it and they'll take it away
26:34 - you know that's actually happened with a
26:36 - css shape inside um
26:38 - nobody used it slightly more complicated
26:40 - than they kind of expected it to be it's
26:42 - gone away until we say that you know
26:44 - actually we do really want this
26:46 - they do look to us for feedback and we
26:48 - should let them know what we want
26:51 - lastly some other ideas if uh this has
26:54 - inspired you and you want to find out
26:55 - more about css shapes or any of these
26:57 - other things these are some other sort
26:58 - of interesting typographical
27:00 - design tweaks that are coming to the web
27:02 - hopefully soon i've linked everything up
27:04 - here so i'll put the slides up later and
27:05 - you can just click through
27:07 - so that's kind of it really
27:09 - mainly i just wanted to be to ask you to
27:11 - be inspired go away make stuff tell me
27:13 - about how you're getting on i'm really
27:14 - interested in your shapes what you make
27:18 - and some more people for inspiration
27:20 - thank you very much everybody
