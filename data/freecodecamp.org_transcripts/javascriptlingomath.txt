00:00 - since we're talking about manipulating
00:03 - data let's talk a little bit about the
00:04 - built in object called math math this is
00:08 - an example math background has a lot of
00:10 - built-in properties and methods that are
00:13 - going to help you manipulate any
00:14 - numerical data that you're working with
00:16 - just like with the other methods you
00:18 - don't have to memorize them all but you
00:20 - should really look at the Mozilla
00:21 - developer Network page to see what math
00:23 - has to offer a good example that I like
00:25 - to use with math is math dot random
00:28 - which I used in my zip line for the
00:31 - quote generator there's something else
00:34 - that you should know about working with
00:35 - numbers that doesn't have to do with
00:37 - math there's something called
00:38 - floating-point format that JavaScript
00:41 - uses what I'm telling you this is later
00:44 - when you're doing a lot of calculations
00:45 - depending on the calculations how large
00:48 - the numbers are how many calculations
00:50 - you're doing there might be a little bit
00:52 - of an accuracy like four or five decimal
00:55 - points down the line there are ways to
00:57 - get around this and it's not that big of
00:59 - a deal
00:59 - but I'm telling you this so if you're
01:01 - ever getting an error or there's some
01:02 - number it just isn't adding up right
01:04 - it's not your fault that's built into
01:06 - the language and there are plenty of
01:07 - ways around it
