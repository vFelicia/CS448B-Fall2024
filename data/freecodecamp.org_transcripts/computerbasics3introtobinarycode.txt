00:00 - Hi, this is Briana from freeCodeCamp
00:03 - and today we're going to talk a little bit about
00:04 - binary code.
00:05 - Now binary code is a really really basic simple
00:09 - computer language where there's just
00:10 - 1's and there's 0's.
00:13 - There's bi (two things), 1's, and 0's.
00:16 - 1's meaning on.
00:17 - 0's meaning off.
00:18 - So think of like a light switch, which in some cases
00:21 - super old computers there was an actual switch
00:23 - which was either on or off.
00:24 - 1 being on. 0 being off.
00:27 - Bunch of 1's and 0's. They can mean pretty much
00:30 - anything, but really they're mostly meant to be
00:32 - numbers and letters.
00:33 - We're going to go in a little bit on how you actually
00:36 - decode binary or translate a number to binary code.
00:40 - But really as you guessed, you can usually just Google
00:43 - binary translator and have that figured out.
00:46 - The most important part of this:
00:47 - Do you understand the concept that even basic things
00:50 - like 0's and 1's can translate into something
00:53 - really really complex.
00:54 - And it is the basis for all the computer languages
00:56 - and programs that exist today.
