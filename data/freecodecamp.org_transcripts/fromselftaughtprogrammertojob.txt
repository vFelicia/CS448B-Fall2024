00:00 - so today we are going to talk about um
00:02 - from self-taught programmer to job uh
00:05 - the reason why we are talking about that
00:07 - is because free code camp is actually
00:09 - the platform where people start to start
00:13 - learning to code
00:14 - but also to get a job in a completely
00:17 - new industry completely different
00:18 - industry that they are used to used to
00:21 - be or used to to work
00:23 - and
00:25 - we were asked many times to
00:27 - talk about our experience and we both
00:30 - came practically from nothing to a
00:32 - program a job and that's why we are
00:34 - talking about it today we will have a
00:36 - question and answer session afterwards
00:38 - so
00:39 - feel free to ask everything you'd like
00:43 - yes just a short roadmap what we're
00:45 - going to cover we will talk about our
00:47 - life before
00:48 - uh we will talk about the learning
00:49 - process we will talk about applying for
00:52 - jobs
00:53 - we will talk about working at the new
00:55 - company
00:56 - then this year explain the main
00:59 - qualities and actions to get a job
01:01 - actually
01:02 - and the last the last thing will be
01:03 - about motivation because people always
01:06 - ask how do you stay motivated on the on
01:08 - the way
01:10 - um so yeah let's let's start with our
01:12 - life before programming
01:14 - um
01:15 - how many of you guys actually started to
01:18 - program
01:20 - from a completely different field
01:25 - cool so like
01:27 - 50
01:28 - something roughly very nice um
01:30 - yeah so so you guys know what it takes
01:32 - to like
01:34 - start with a completely new
01:36 - set of of rules and mindset
01:39 - in my case it was like
01:41 - i'm a student i'm a business law student
01:44 - uh i have worked in different uh
01:47 - business law firms tax advisory firm
01:50 - had different workshops and also had
01:53 - like entrepreneurial stuff
01:56 - but most of the time i was also like
01:58 - non-profit worker so most of the time i
02:00 - was just student working and working
02:03 - here just working and studying my whole
02:05 - life so
02:07 - not really much programming i had no
02:09 - idea what html was
02:11 - nothing
02:13 - yes
02:14 - that's that's about me
02:17 - yeah
02:18 - and with his background in business and
02:20 - such i had a different background i grew
02:23 - up on a wet cold mountain in bergen i
02:26 - was raised by sheep farmers it was quite
02:29 - miserable at times but no that's not the
02:32 - real story but
02:33 - maybe i should control them yeah
02:36 - but i did grow up in
02:38 - or by wet mountains in bergen
02:42 - it's one of the rainiest cities in north
02:44 - and northern europe it has about 250
02:46 - days of rain a year
02:48 - so it gets quite miserable but we
02:50 - strangely enough we cope
02:52 - and
02:53 - i didn't get raised by sheep farmers but
02:56 - we have national costumes in norway that
02:58 - are mainly made of wool
03:00 - and just pay special attention to
03:03 - the fact that these socks are purely
03:05 - made out of sheep's wool handcrafted and
03:08 - such so they're always a pain to put on
03:10 - for these occasions they go up until
03:12 - like here
03:13 - so that's nice
03:16 - my
03:17 - background back to childhood i was
03:19 - always the computer guy in class i
03:20 - always liked from the first chance i had
03:23 - with a dad or with a dad working in tech
03:25 - to uh
03:27 - you know bash at the keyboard or h5 or
03:29 - something from a
03:30 - commodore or macintosh or something
03:33 - i
03:34 - always
03:35 - found out they had or early on found out
03:37 - they had a love for computers
03:38 - i didn't take it further until then
03:41 - learning html
03:43 - making some websites i had two parents
03:46 - my father
03:48 - and my mother they got divorced
03:50 - whenever i was at my dad and i used to
03:51 - live mainly at my mom's place
03:53 - he had internet so i could get tutorials
03:56 - on how to learn html print them out go
03:58 - back to my you know regular home
04:01 - on a computer with no internet learn how
04:03 - to make stuff with html it was really
04:06 - cool but then a couple of years later i
04:08 - got a book java in 21 days and i was
04:10 - like yes
04:11 - but i was the kind of person who since i
04:13 - didn't understand why it's a system out
04:16 - clinton
04:17 - i must be a stupid guy because there can
04:19 - only be math geniuses understands this
04:21 - is esoteric type we're writing out and
04:23 - why it makes some stuff happen and there
04:26 - was no one there for me to tell me that
04:29 - take a step back you're not stupid this
04:31 - is the same for everyone in the
04:32 - beginning
04:34 - and it was the same for me also in
04:35 - school learning maths it was easy for me
04:38 - or all courses in school was easy for me
04:41 - up until the stage where we had sort of
04:43 - like
04:44 - equations algebra and stuff
04:47 - and i thought that hey
04:49 - up until that point i just had to be in
04:50 - class pay attention barely do homework i
04:53 - did fine but then once i had to memorize
04:56 - rules and just apply them i didn't
04:58 - understand that that was what you were
04:59 - going to do i thought i had to
05:02 - really understand what was going on
05:03 - because that's how it had worked for me
05:05 - up until that point so
05:06 - all this just to say that i really had
05:09 - enforced the myth that
05:11 - programming is for math geniuses only so
05:14 - i kind of ruled it out from that from
05:15 - that point on
05:18 - and then skipping ahead a little bit
05:19 - young adult life
05:21 - instead of going into computer school
05:22 - which i maybe let's just call it that
05:24 - which i maybe would have done if i would
05:27 - have not have this misconception
05:29 - i instead said hey let's try psychology
05:32 - studies didn't work out let's try to
05:34 - study philosophy
05:35 - didn't work out then i kind of
05:37 - prioritized student life and working
05:39 - instead of studying and at one point i
05:41 - panicked realized i couldn't really get
05:43 - a job as a philosopher so i went to
05:46 - ireland and i'm from norway but i went
05:48 - to ireland to work for multinational
05:50 - companies and eventually all this led to
05:54 - me
05:54 - having a bit of a burnout i worked in
05:56 - sales tech support
05:59 - public service public transport support
06:00 - and so on i didn't really work jobs i
06:03 - liked i just went there to earn money
06:06 - and i became a sad panda
06:08 - and i mean it literally because
06:10 - i became a sad panda
06:13 - life in ireland just working drinking
06:17 - eating whatever i wanted was not good
06:19 - for me
06:21 - cool yeah now let's let's go to the
06:23 - learning process
06:24 - um
06:26 - when you start to learn to code it's
06:28 - like like like this picture here
06:31 - my code isn't working and i don't know
06:33 - why and if the code is working i also
06:35 - don't know why so this was always like
06:38 - when i'm was working on something it was
06:40 - always like this
06:41 - and i guess it's for most of you like
06:43 - like that when you started out learning
06:45 - to code
06:47 - for me i captured my whole learning
06:49 - experience like in these three pictures
06:51 - here uh on the first you see like github
06:54 - contributions
06:55 - um on the second you see like cheesecake
06:57 - and coffee because that's like super
06:59 - important when you program a lot
07:01 - and down here that's actually
07:03 - one hour before the gym it's actually in
07:05 - the gym
07:06 - um
07:07 - but what i wanted to tell with that
07:09 - picture is that you have to
07:11 - are you
07:12 - yeah you have to fit in
07:14 - or use every every time you get when you
07:17 - are busy when you have family studying
07:19 - working
07:20 - you don't have time for learning to code
07:23 - your whole day so when you have time
07:26 - like an hour before the gym or whatever
07:29 - or when you're traveling on the bus on
07:30 - the train use the time for coding
07:34 - and
07:34 - as you as you can see here i was like
07:37 - that's only github i was like coding
07:39 - every day like there's the challenge
07:41 - like 100 days of code
07:43 - forming a habit so it gets into your
07:46 - body
07:47 - and that's actually the result
07:50 - and that's without the free code cam
07:51 - curriculum which also looked like that
07:54 - so
07:56 - many many hours many many contributions
07:58 - and a lot of coffee and
08:00 - studying and yeah just learning to code
08:03 - um that's also like from my article as i
08:05 - said before um
08:08 - this this this tool is like wacka time
08:10 - it's like a plug-in for the editor
08:12 - it's it's for free so you can check how
08:15 - much time you actually spend
08:17 - on on projects on github and here what
08:21 - i've tracked like from
08:22 - mid what's it like from mid april april
08:26 - to mid july or in july like 250 hours i
08:30 - spent just coding so
08:32 - that that boils down to like an average
08:34 - of two hours per day so just to give you
08:37 - a perspective how much it
08:38 - can take to learn to program and to not
08:42 - be frustrated along the way
08:44 - just put in the hours
08:46 - and what you can see here also is like
08:49 - i put in or i created on codepen
08:51 - actually a small application homepage
08:54 - that actually counts the day i was
08:56 - uh
08:58 - yeah time spending coding and till this
09:01 - day it's like 380 days so that's pretty
09:03 - cool
09:04 - and what i also wanted to tell you with
09:06 - that is like to do your own projects
09:08 - always don't try to follow the
09:10 - curriculum or whatever tutorial try to
09:13 - make your own stuff happen and you will
09:14 - learn much quicker and better in general
09:18 - so
09:19 - to have it in a nutshell i put in many
09:21 - hours did a lot of research not only not
09:24 - only tutorials or videos
09:26 - or books or whatever try everything out
09:29 - see what works for you best and then go
09:31 - with it in my case it was just many
09:33 - contributions and own projects and
09:36 - always trust yourself
09:38 - but i'm going into that
09:40 - later on
09:42 - yeah yeah
09:43 - so going back to my uh
09:46 - my misconception that you had to be a
09:48 - math genius to learn to program
09:51 - to get out of this burnout and to get a
09:53 - better life i gradually tried
09:55 - to do that
09:56 - one project was me and a partner in
09:58 - norway we started a company to provide
10:00 - websites for businesses based on
10:02 - wordpress
10:03 - we never really took off we never scaled
10:05 - super high mainly because we didn't have
10:07 - enough sales but we had a few customers
10:10 - and at the point we were thinking i was
10:12 - thinking
10:13 - i was part of the technical part and my
10:15 - partner was part of the sales
10:17 - and i was thinking
10:19 - we're doing this stuff and we're just
10:20 - barely making any margin on offering
10:22 - shared host hosting for our customers
10:24 - what if we could host ourselves and i'd
10:25 - already been interested in linux for a
10:27 - while but you know how it can be with
10:28 - linux you try and you try and you fail
10:30 - and you try and you fail and you try and
10:32 - then eventually maybe you make a switch
10:34 - to linux which i have but it took a long
10:36 - while so in that process i knew it was
10:38 - possible to host yourself so i decided
10:40 - hey let's try this i tried some
10:42 - tutorials and i finally had a
10:43 - breakthrough
10:44 - when i um
10:48 - stumbled across linux academy and i took
10:51 - apart it was the first time i was using
10:53 - an online course to learn to train
10:55 - myself or to teach myself something
10:57 - and i managed to from
10:59 - knowing nothing about hosting servers
11:02 - just shared hosting
11:03 - to be able to set up a lamp stack linux
11:06 - or
11:07 - mysql and php and offer hosting for our
11:10 - customers professionally so that was a
11:12 - big hall for me but i was still thinking
11:14 - you have to be a math genius to learn
11:16 - programming figure that
11:18 - so
11:19 - this picture was to illustrate when i
11:22 - realized that hey i could learn stuff
11:23 - online then i thought let's try
11:25 - programming but it must be hard so let's
11:28 - try again i tried treehouse first just
11:30 - to brush up html and css kind of tasted
11:33 - a little bit on javascript i thought hey
11:34 - okay it's cool to learn about functions
11:36 - and variables and control statements and
11:38 - stuff but you know when does the real
11:40 - programming start so i kind of took a
11:42 - step back and it wasn't until i
11:44 - stumbled across free code camp about two
11:46 - years ago now
11:48 - um that i realized that all the stuff
11:50 - that i thought was just the basics in
11:52 - programming is programming and then you
11:55 - just have to iterate over the same
11:56 - things use them in different ways go a
11:57 - little bit more advanced into the
11:59 - language and design and other topics
12:02 - that are more like um on the
12:04 - architectural or um just get it in your
12:06 - fingers and be experienced and know what
12:08 - is the best
12:09 - choice for the for the job and so forth
12:12 - but the basics stay the same and when i
12:13 - realized that
12:16 - just imagine after about 30 years or
12:20 - you know i'm 33 now but i was probably
12:22 - around 30 done but after many years from
12:24 - a kid thinking that programming was not
12:26 - for me to finally bursting the bubble
12:29 - and thinking i can do this
12:31 - i was really motivated because i really
12:33 - wanted to do this and i saw it as a way
12:35 - out of my misery
12:37 - so then i stuck with frico camp
12:40 - as
12:41 - dalia said it can be challenging and you
12:43 - have to put in a lot of hours
12:45 - i put in a lot of work at first as many
12:47 - people do and then i fell out a little
12:49 - bit i wrote about it at my blog hello i
12:52 - love code.com
12:54 - and
12:55 - one of the things that helped me was to
12:57 - take a step back from free code camp
12:59 - read a book that is actually in the i
13:01 - saw it it's here
13:04 - eloquent javascript helped me personally
13:06 - to uh get a fresh look at free code at
13:11 - javascript not from free code camp but
13:13 - from another source i supplemented with
13:15 - other courses i like udemy because they
13:17 - have a lot of courses that you can buy
13:19 - on demand and keep for life
13:21 - and then i got back into the groove of
13:23 - record camp
13:26 - yeah so the book here is not an icon for
13:27 - something youtube started doing that's
13:29 - just because i also use books
13:32 - yeah and free code camp when we talk
13:35 - about motivation a little bit later it
13:37 - has been a constant
13:40 - part in this whole journey uh just
13:42 - knowing that i was organizing starting
13:44 - to organize the free local group here
13:46 - for the free code camp meant that i felt
13:49 - obligated to make sure i could tell the
13:52 - other people at the meet up that i had
13:53 - progresses the last time so this this
13:55 - social aspect was really helpful as well
13:59 - yeah so after learning a lot the next
14:01 - step is actually applying for a job and
14:04 - i think that's pretty interesting for us
14:06 - because our story stories are pretty
14:09 - yeah different actually
14:12 - for me just two pictures here one day
14:14 - from the interview from the day of the
14:15 - interview and another picture is also
14:18 - from the
14:19 - meetup here
14:21 - the reason why i'm putting up those
14:22 - pictures here
14:24 - just to give you an impression how how i
14:26 - looked when i was applying
14:29 - for the job
14:30 - but to
14:32 - summarize it i don't wanted to be an
14:34 - employee actually i started to go to
14:36 - become a freelancer and i was only
14:39 - focused on projects and meetups i wanted
14:42 - to get to know people and i wanted to
14:44 - build own projects
14:46 - and i tried to contribute as much as
14:48 - possible to anything code related and
14:51 - literally when i when i
14:54 - when i did realize there are meetups
14:56 - here in vienna it was my first meetup it
14:58 - was actually the web clerk's meetup here
15:00 - and i was going to everyone and
15:03 - like hi i'm daniel i'm a programmer
15:06 - beginner i don't know a lot but another
15:08 - little thing
15:09 - yeah do you have an open source project
15:11 - and if yes can i contribute and i was
15:13 - like going to everyone like hi i'm
15:15 - daniel can i contribute and then like
15:18 - you know everybody and then i met one
15:21 - guy actually benny and he said of course
15:23 - yeah i had i have an an open source
15:26 - project we can like work on it together
15:28 - and then we we met for weeks and months
15:31 - and like after i don't know four to five
15:33 - months he was like
15:35 - yeah my company is looking looking for a
15:37 - developer we have like a job offer do
15:40 - you want to work with me i was like yeah
15:42 - of course and that's actually it how i
15:44 - got the job of course there was like an
15:46 - interview and he was asking questions he
15:48 - was like yeah show me your project
15:51 - tell me a little bit about you tell me a
15:52 - little bit about your your your stack
15:55 - why do you want to do it that way et
15:57 - cetera but nothing really hard no hard
15:59 - questions
16:00 - and what i want to tell you here is
16:03 - for me up the absolute key here was to
16:06 - build a relationship to network and get
16:09 - into a job
16:11 - over a guy i already knew
16:13 - that's like super powerful because he
16:15 - can refer me
16:17 - and also like from the employer's side
16:19 - he's he's like okay he has already
16:21 - worked with one of my employees so he
16:25 - has to have something good and he trus
16:27 - the employer already trusts the other
16:29 - employee so that was like a big plus and
16:31 - that's actually for me it was actually
16:33 - pretty easy
16:36 - so on your side
16:38 - i wanted a little bit different route
16:41 - back to my work
16:43 - having a company in norway selling
16:45 - websites to companies
16:47 - i did that and i also supplemented with
16:48 - some freelance work mainly a very simple
16:51 - wordpress based task a lot of repetitive
16:53 - stuff didn't like it all so much but
16:56 - that was in the phase that i was
16:57 - starting to learn to code so as i
16:59 - learned to code i could do more code
17:01 - related stuff
17:02 - um one of the criterias for me is
17:05 - looking for a job
17:06 - i was in this freelance state but i
17:08 - wanted something full-time because the
17:09 - freelance was
17:11 - sporadic or not stable enough income for
17:13 - me
17:14 - but i wanted to look for a full-time job
17:16 - and it had to be english-speaking
17:18 - because my german is not so good if they
17:20 - would allow german they would have to be
17:21 - really
17:22 - kind people
17:25 - and then i focused on continuing to
17:27 - organize the meetup that i had started
17:29 - here and i also organized uh
17:32 - now it must be
17:34 - last year maybe node school uh in the
17:37 - summer i contacted node.js speed up and
17:39 - said hey can we do something so i helped
17:42 - do that i also helped to hacker x which
17:45 - is speed dating for developers
17:47 - have their first two events in vienna so
17:50 - i was an ambassador for them
17:52 - and i'm also the ambassador for hacker
17:53 - econ for ambassador no what's it called
17:56 - uh angelhack even though they haven't
17:58 - had something here yet i hope they will
18:00 - come soon so all these things i could
18:02 - put on my resume and i was active and i
18:04 - was in the community and i liked to
18:06 - engage and it was also something i could
18:08 - benefit from when searching for jobs
18:12 - i didn't feel when i started to send
18:14 - applications around april
18:16 - that i had enough portfolio stuff and i
18:18 - really didn't i just had a couple of
18:19 - things from free code camp and i had
18:22 - something you know when you're forking
18:23 - stuff on github and you're just putting
18:25 - down some lines in a new idea thing and
18:27 - stuff so that it looked like it was busy
18:29 - but it wasn't really much on github
18:30 - either
18:31 - but i said hey let's just try to apply
18:33 - because i have to apply and get a get a
18:35 - job let's see how this goes
18:37 - um i just had the approach that i would
18:39 - just send as many applications as i as i
18:42 - could
18:43 - uh not super many but definitely over 50
18:46 - applications in the span of april to
18:47 - august
18:48 - 50 50 50 5-0 but it doesn't have to be
18:52 - hard like you can go on sites i also
18:54 - included remote work so i can go on
18:56 - sites like weworkremotely.com and others
18:58 - for remote work find uh you know the
19:00 - ones that are looking go to their site
19:02 - you know copy paste into the form have a
19:04 - little bit of a application letter if
19:06 - you want to be personal and so on so it
19:08 - doesn't have to take so much time so i
19:10 - just try to make it a streamline as
19:12 - possible and of course apply if i really
19:15 - liked the job ad i also had a rule of it
19:18 - was if i was in doubt either if i liked
19:20 - the job or not or if the job said mid to
19:23 - senior and i was like ah or they had
19:25 - this list of requirements and i had like
19:27 - maybe 10 percent i'd be like okay you
19:29 - know what you can think as much as you
19:31 - want but if you don't apply you'll never
19:33 - know so i just made the rule i'll apply
19:35 - if i'm in doubt so
19:37 - a lot of applications um
19:40 - i had two rounds one round with a plain
19:42 - application
19:43 - black and white like i learned in school
19:45 - you should list your experience you
19:47 - should or you list your school
19:48 - experience and chronologically
19:49 - everything boring plain straightforward
19:53 - uh didn't work so well so i said okay
19:56 - let me rephrase things a little bit
19:58 - present myself as an already developer
20:00 - and not down sell myself so i changed
20:03 - some wording i presented myself better
20:04 - and i got a professionally looking
20:06 - template with a picture and some colors
20:09 - and stuff and really nice
20:11 - layout design
20:13 - and that really helps because after just
20:15 - the first few applications i got
20:16 - feedback
20:18 - it ended up that i got the job that was
20:20 - the first interview i went to
20:22 - but it took them probably two months or
20:24 - something to offer me the job
20:26 - so in the meantime i had i think four
20:29 - other interviews
20:31 - um and the interview also as daniel said
20:33 - for me it wasn't so technical it was
20:35 - more that they saw that i had the
20:36 - ability to learn that i could talk about
20:40 - the choices i'd made in terms of the
20:42 - frameworks and technologies i was using
20:44 - for my
20:46 - projects when i was learning that i was
20:48 - not just following along but was
20:50 - reflected about it and i really had
20:52 - found the passion of coding that i
20:54 - didn't know um i could do until recently
20:58 - so i think that
21:07 - yeah a short take on working at the new
21:09 - company that's very i want to keep that
21:11 - very short um
21:13 - because at first it is like it's too
21:15 - much this is too much this is literally
21:17 - how you look
21:18 - in the new company um
21:21 - because it's like of course of course
21:23 - you you will be overwhelmed um because
21:25 - there are like people more experienced
21:27 - in a field you have never worked in of
21:29 - course
21:30 - what we want to talk about here is like
21:32 - okay the company is different every
21:34 - company is different so there is no uh
21:37 - what one rule fits all uh solution here
21:41 - and what's also like important is to
21:42 - keep always the learning attitude
21:44 - because people are like
21:46 - way smarter than you probably or
21:49 - hopefully
21:50 - and you will have like failures and you
21:53 - you might not know a lot
21:55 - but with having a learning attitude
21:57 - everything will work out perfectly yeah
22:00 - and you can also lean on the stuff that
22:03 - you learned while learning to code which
22:05 - most program or hopefully all
22:07 - programmers do in their job which is
22:09 - googling if you don't know the answer
22:11 - you google and you try to figure it out
22:12 - you open 10 tabs you go through them you
22:14 - find the best answer you see if you
22:15 - learn something hopefully you don't copy
22:17 - paste everything from stack overflow
22:19 - but
22:21 - that is something that is good that you
22:23 - already have a habit of
22:25 - and definitely i was also overwhelmed i
22:27 - had the impostor syndrome i was like i'm
22:29 - not good enough for this i just they're
22:31 - gonna fire me after a month oh okay i'm
22:32 - here i'm here i'm still here in a month
22:34 - they're gonna fire me next month no i'm
22:36 - still here it's been a year now i'm
22:38 - still there so i must be doing something
22:39 - this must be doing something right
22:42 - uh yeah
22:44 - yeah
22:45 - i think that's mainly it about
22:48 - our experiences we're open for questions
22:50 - afterwards in terms of working at the
22:52 - new company
22:53 - but
22:54 - it has definitely been a challenging
22:56 - ride but
22:58 - joyful and learning experience and
23:00 - yeah
23:02 - yeah so now the takeaways
23:06 - i think this is the most important part
23:08 - of our presentation and it's also like
23:09 - the last part so
23:11 - feel free to be
23:13 - or to to pay attention to these points
23:16 - because it's like
23:18 - what we we decided is the most important
23:20 - thing
23:21 - when you start applying for job or
23:24 - getting in a new industry and for us it
23:27 - was like
23:28 - three free points actually it was like
23:30 - skills ability to learn and passion yeah
23:34 - yeah this is this is as he said
23:36 - condensing down of what we found to be
23:38 - the most important things uh obviously
23:40 - you have to have some programming skills
23:42 - you have to know uh the job that you're
23:44 - applying for
23:46 - if you can demonstrate that you have the
23:48 - ability to learn which is easier when
23:50 - you can back it up with the free code
23:52 - cam process of progress or something
23:54 - like that that's really helpful
23:56 - every employer is different some
23:57 - companies they don't really care so much
23:59 - about the ability to learn or the
24:01 - passion they want someone with years of
24:03 - experience dependable etc for every
24:05 - company it's different but in our
24:07 - experience we found that the companies
24:09 - that do accommodate and do focus on
24:11 - these three things are the ones that
24:13 - you're most likely to get a job at
24:16 - and passion as well is something i just
24:18 - want to touch on because i know that
24:20 - a lot of developers or people wanting to
24:22 - get into programming doesn't necessarily
24:25 - do it
24:26 - because they love to do it
24:29 - it's perfectly fine if you have have the
24:31 - idea that you want to change a career
24:33 - either for economic reasons or because
24:35 - you want to do something different and
24:37 - um you've seen that programming could be
24:40 - a locative field or you could have some
24:42 - freedom etc
24:44 - so you don't have to have the passion is
24:46 - what i'm going to get at um
24:48 - but we found that it helps and if you
24:50 - can communicate somehow some aspects of
24:53 - programming and development etc or the
24:55 - culture or whatever that you like and
24:57 - you can get it across in an interview
24:59 - it helps yeah so basically you have to
25:02 - find a balance between
25:04 - your skills and your ability to learn
25:06 - your passion so it has to be in balance
25:08 - or you have to provide something at
25:10 - least to convince the future employer
25:14 - yes what are the concrete actions that
25:16 - you can take to get a job
25:19 - and
25:20 - for or we concluded that
25:23 - the most important things here are
25:24 - portfolio
25:26 - network working and promoting yourself
25:28 - and actually showing up it's like that's
25:31 - like
25:32 - maybe it might be the hardest thing
25:34 - actually to do
25:35 - um so yeah you want to take on yeah um
25:39 - building a portfolio on github
25:40 - contributions i had a phone interview
25:43 - with the company
25:44 - and i was he tried this sounded like he
25:47 - had a little bit more expectations than
25:48 - what i had tried to give across in my
25:50 - resume so i was kind of like saying down
25:52 - playing it a little bit maybe i
25:54 - shouldn't have but i did and he was
25:56 - commenting oh yeah but you have so much
25:57 - stuff on your github profile i was like
26:00 - yeah yeah and i was thinking afterwards
26:02 - wow the power of just having something
26:04 - on your github profile i'm not saying
26:06 - you should just put something that is
26:08 - crap and just hope that it helps but if
26:10 - you have something on github that is
26:12 - your earnest effort to learn and you're
26:15 - active and you're contributing you're
26:17 - trying to change something in the readme
26:18 - of a big open source project that's also
26:20 - fine if you can like get a taste for the
26:23 - field all that helps
26:26 - also from reading articles or hearing
26:28 - experiences
26:30 - from others
26:31 - most hiring managers will not read your
26:33 - code they might skim a little bit and
26:35 - then they skip the rest because
26:38 - not everyone loves reading other
26:39 - people's code
26:41 - all day long
26:42 - as for the networking and promoting
26:44 - yourself there also is a point that is
26:46 - also supposed to cover the aspect of
26:48 - sending out your resumes so you don't
26:50 - have to network you don't have to go out
26:52 - there and say hey hey hey
26:54 - if you if you're not the person that
26:56 - want to
26:57 - don't feel comfortable doing that that's
26:58 - fine but then you
27:00 - make sure you send out resumes and
27:02 - applications
27:05 - the job of the application i found is to
27:07 - get yourself an interview so again just
27:10 - if in doubt just send out
27:12 - applications and
27:14 - they're the job of sending those
27:15 - applications is so you get
27:17 - invited to an interview
27:19 - so keep that in mind and in the
27:21 - interview it's the job of the
27:23 - prospective employer to decide whether
27:26 - or not you're a fit for the company
27:28 - yeah
27:29 - if i had to break it down to one single
27:32 - important feature it's like the
27:33 - portfolio because i've been asked about
27:36 - show me something not just from the
27:38 - employer future employer just friends
27:40 - whoever everybody just wants to see
27:42 - something and you should at least be
27:45 - able to
27:47 - show them something
27:48 - and as robert said before i totally
27:50 - agree on that like just showing that
27:53 - you're so that you did something at
27:55 - github is incredibly powerful it looks
27:57 - amazing and nobody nobody really dives
28:00 - into the code and says ah that's like
28:02 - that's not good
28:03 - so yeah that's it that's it for my side
28:06 - on the concrete actions
28:08 - yeah the last the last point here
28:10 - motivation because we've been asked many
28:12 - many times how to stay motivated and we
28:15 - summarize it in in three points here um
28:18 - ask yourself why
28:19 - develop a habit and trust yourself do
28:22 - you want to start
28:24 - uh yeah for me um
28:27 - the why was obvious i
28:29 - realized i had a passion for code and i
28:30 - didn't think i would ever be able to
28:32 - program so that was kind of
28:34 - just
28:35 - i got for free
28:38 - the habit was
28:40 - using free core camp with the points and
28:41 - the structure it's really nice to know
28:43 - that you have a progression towards
28:45 - something certificate or portfolio
28:47 - projects etc and it also helps as i
28:50 - mentioned earlier to come to um
28:52 - especially the free code camp meetup so
28:54 - i was you know had the social incentive
28:56 - to say hey okay i'm pushing myself a
28:57 - little bit further because i wanted to
28:59 - finish the calculator for example until
29:02 - the next meet up because if i talked
29:03 - about it at the previous meetup that i
29:05 - was working on it i should maybe have it
29:07 - finished by the next time i see the same
29:08 - people
29:10 - yeah
29:11 - and um
29:13 - yeah it's easy to adopt yourself but you
29:15 - kind of just have to uh
29:18 - push through it regardless
29:21 - for me with
29:23 - not feeling i had enough portfolio
29:24 - projects to apply i just applied anyways
29:26 - so you kind of have to push yourself a
29:28 - little bit to um
29:30 - to
29:31 - continue on
29:33 - yeah
29:34 - yeah i think it's incredibly important
29:37 - to ask yourself why and always remind
29:39 - yourself why you are on that path always
29:41 - because you will have failures you will
29:44 - have setbacks
29:45 - and then it's important to remind
29:47 - yourself why you actually on that path
29:49 - and just just look at the scene here
29:51 - right now we have like friday evening
29:54 - you could be at the bar drinking with
29:55 - friends we all have like other things to
29:57 - do but you're here everybody is here
30:00 - actually learning or connecting or
30:02 - networking so you already here and you
30:04 - know why you're here um and that's also
30:07 - like with the trust yourself part here
30:10 - it's it can be incredible difficult to
30:12 - try to start a new journey in a new
30:14 - industry people are doubting you you
30:17 - keep having rejection and failures as he
30:19 - said before like 50 times applying 50
30:22 - times
30:23 - i in previous jobs i was also like
30:24 - applying 40 50 times that's normal but
30:27 - it's like
30:28 - or maybe it isn't normal i don't know
30:30 - but
30:31 - it's incredible hard it's like rejection
30:34 - people
30:35 - don't even read your your application
30:37 - and that can be really hard so don't be
30:40 - frustrated or don't give up on that
30:41 - because i know some people here are
30:43 - applying always and they're getting
30:45 - rejected and that's just part of the
30:47 - equation that's just the part don't be
30:49 - frustrated if that happens
30:52 - and
30:53 - yeah
30:54 - yeah like the guy here with the startup
30:55 - he's also here he's here he's motivated
30:58 - he has passion for his startup so
31:01 - that's that's my point on on motivation
31:04 - trust yourself and not only the progress
31:06 - or the process is incredible hard but
31:08 - also like people or family like people
31:11 - always telling you
31:14 - stay on your path stay on your like for
31:16 - me my family expected me to be a lawyer
31:18 - and my grandmother was like ah nice a
31:20 - liar and now i'm telling her like i'm
31:22 - programming and she was and she's like
31:24 - what is programming is it like game boy
31:26 - playing or what what is that she doesn't
31:28 - really see that that's difficult and
31:30 - that's opportunities here so that's also
31:32 - like incredible or it can be incredible
31:35 - tough
31:36 - so yeah just look out for that and
31:39 - yeah stay motivated on the way do you
31:41 - have anything to add no no i think you
31:44 - said it beautifully yeah yeah motivation
31:47 - is key is key um yeah if you have any
31:49 - questions feel free to ask
31:51 - um about motivation yeah
31:54 - we want to make sure that we have uh on
31:56 - record a big thanks to free code camp
31:58 - both the local group here which consists
32:00 - of everyone here that keep coming and
32:02 - also the new faces that maybe also want
32:04 - to keep coming
32:06 - and to quincy larson's work at starting
32:09 - freecodcamp.org a couple of years ago
32:11 - and how helpful it has been for us it's
32:13 - definitely
32:14 - not sure we would have had the same path
32:16 - to getting a job if we didn't have free
32:19 - coca absolutely totally agree on that
32:22 - very good platform
32:23 - yes so for to that
32:26 - um yeah this uh if you want to so almost
32:30 - thanks for us we have our contact
32:32 - details and we also have a quite a half
32:35 - of an announcement in the next slide but
32:38 - um you can contact daniel at
32:41 - twitter github and his website other
32:44 - places as well
32:45 - same goes for me
32:47 - and as for the announcement
32:50 - we are so inspired by our journey to
32:52 - becoming
32:53 - full-time developers that we started a
32:56 - friend an organization to help others do
32:59 - the same
33:00 - it's really in the starting phases if
33:02 - you go to developer's racing i just put
33:03 - it up on a server today and it just says
33:05 - developer's rising there's nothing there
33:07 - and we have a gmail address but it will
33:09 - be changed eventually but for now uh
33:12 - keep us in mind i will also link it as
33:15 - since we are organizing through codecamp
33:17 - this local group will keep mentioning it
33:19 - if people are interested
33:21 - um the purpose is to
33:24 - support programmers in general and
33:26 - provide provide a platform of exchange
33:29 - it's actually what we have been doing
33:31 - for the last month and years even years
33:35 - but with a legal framework so and we are
33:38 - not like
33:40 - we are not tied to the free code camp
33:42 - brand so we can do much more yeah and we
33:45 - also want to explore more
33:46 - so you can expect many
33:49 - nice things to happen um yeah but and we
33:51 - also want to try and
33:53 - try out ways to help others go from
33:55 - learning to code to get a job so yeah we
33:57 - have some ideas and we'll play around
33:58 - with some stuff and if people want to
34:00 - get involved it's an organization you
34:01 - can become a member
34:03 - and
34:04 - yeah yeah also if you if you want to
34:07 - contribute and as you've seen before
34:09 - when we're talking about getting a job
34:10 - it's like contributing can be very uh
34:12 - can be very valuable um if you want to
34:15 - help out or something or contribute feel
34:17 - free to just get in touch and yeah we'll
34:20 - find something
34:21 - yes yes
