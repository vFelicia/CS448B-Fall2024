00:00 - Hi, I'm Beau Carnes with Free Code Camp. In 
this course, I will teach you how to create a  
00:04 - full ecommerce store with WooCommerce and 
WordPress. These are free tools that you  
00:09 - can use to create a wide variety of E commerce 
websites, and I will teach you everything you  
00:14 - need to know step by step. This course is perfect 
for beginners, there is no coding whatsoever,  
00:20 - and you'll be able to do everything 
with a simple graphical interface.  
00:23 - The WooCommerce plugin makes it simple to turn 
a WordPress website into a complete ecommerce  
00:29 - business. In this course, you will learn how 
to customize your store, create products,  
00:34 - accept payments with credit cards and PayPal, set 
taxes and shipping rates, create coupon codes,  
00:41 - and more. First, I'm going to show you how to 
do the initial setup. This includes getting a  
00:47 - domain name hosting, and installing WordPress and 
WooCommerce. Next, I'll show you how to install an  
00:54 - e commerce Store template and easily customize the 
look of it so it fits with your specific brand.  
01:01 - After the store looks exactly how you like, I'll 
show you how to add four different types of store  
01:06 - products. Finally, I'll show you how to set up 
the payment processing automatic tax calculations,  
01:12 - shipping rates and coupon codes so customers can 
check out on your website. Along the way, you  
01:18 - will also learn other tips such as customizing the 
email sent to customers, adding related products,  
01:24 - creating store categories, and more. This course 
is all you need to set up a store. But if you want  
01:30 - to learn more about customizing the look of your 
WordPress website, you can check out my previous  
01:35 - WordPress course. So let's get started. First, 
I'm going to show you how to get your domain  
01:41 - and your hosting. This is the part that you will 
have to pay some money, but it is pretty cheap.  
01:46 - The name usually cost between 10 and $20 per 
year, and hosting often cost around $5 per month,  
01:53 - we're going to use hosting her. There's a 
lot of websites that provide website hosting,  
01:58 - hosting, or is provided a grant that has made this 
course possible. And that's why we're going to  
02:03 - show you how to set things up with hosting. Now 
even before I made this course, or we got this  
02:08 - grant with Free Code Camp, I actually use hosting 
or for some of my personal sites, and I had a  
02:14 - really good experience with them. Some things 
about hosting or is if you get the right type of  
02:19 - subscription, you can get a free domain lifetime 
SSL and DDoS protection. But just so you know,  
02:24 - everything I teach in this course will work 
with other hosting providers as well. So you  
02:28 - don't have to go with hosting. So let's just 
click Start down, start now. And there's a few  
02:33 - different options here. If you're just starting 
out, I would recommend just the cheapest option,  
02:38 - you can always upgrade later if you need 
to. But see, this includes one website,  
02:43 - and then the next one up includes 100 websites, 
but we're just making one website. So just select  
02:48 - that one. And then you choose just how long you 
want to sign up for, you're probably going to  
02:52 - want at least 12 months, but you may want the 24 
months or the 40 months to get a different deal.  
02:58 - And then you can just enter all your information. 
Now I'm not going to go through all this right  
03:02 - now, because I already have an account, I 
just want to show you what you have to do.  
03:05 - So I want me to sign into my account, and then 
I can show you what's gonna what's gonna look  
03:08 - like after you get signed in. Okay, once 
you get signed in, you can get your domain,  
03:14 - you may have already gotten your domain in 
the process of signing up for your hosting  
03:19 - provider. But if not, you may have to get your 
domain afterwards. And just so you know, it is  
03:23 - possible to buy a domain from one company and get 
your hosting from a different company and connect  
03:28 - them. But for this tutorial, we're just showing 
how you would get your domain name from the same  
03:33 - company as the hosting. So I'll just click Claim 
domain. And the here is where you you may have to  
03:40 - search through quite a few domains to find one 
that's not already taken. Let me just try some  
03:49 - about robot clothing, no robot attire.  
03:57 - Okay, we got one that WORKED robot attire because 
this is going to be a clothing store. Okay,  
04:04 - I'm going to claim the domain. Let's get 
this set up. And this is just on my own  
04:09 - personal and I'll just finish registration. 
Okay, now I can start creating the website.  
04:17 - And it's pending verification. So I just 
need to go and click the link in my email.  
04:21 - And make sure you turn on this who has privacy 
or anybody can look up your your information.  
04:28 - And you could be getting a lot of email 
spam emails, even like letters to your  
04:33 - address. Let me show you how to create a 
custom email from your domain. So I'm under  
04:40 - hosting or domain overview. If I scroll 
down here, I can go to manage email.  
04:45 - Here I am going to create a new email account. 
So I'm going to add email account and it's just  
04:52 - going to be info at robot attire.com. And 
then I'll create a password And then create.  
05:04 - If I click on webmail, it will open up to where 
I can log in. And here, once I get logged in,  
05:13 - I can send and receive email from info at robot 
tire.com. Okay, let me go back to the home here.  
05:20 - And I'm going to set up the premium shared 
hosting. This is where we'll install WordPress  
05:30 - you can go to the survey.  
05:35 - And here is where you can choose to just install 
WordPress, or in chaw install WordPress plus  
05:43 - WooCommerce. And that's what we want to do, 
we want to install WooCommerce and WordPress,  
05:49 - because WooCommerce is going to power 
the store that runs on WordPress.  
05:54 - And then just create an account here.  
05:58 - And you can just pick a template right here, I'm 
actually going to install the template later,  
06:04 - just so you can see how you would do if you don't 
have hosting. Or if you're not using hosting,  
06:08 - or if you're using a different hosting 
provider, you may not get a chance to  
06:12 - pick a template right here, and you may have 
to do it later. So that's what we're gonna do.  
06:17 - And we'll just connect it right to robot 
attire.com. Okay, I'll finish the setup.  
06:25 - And again, you can install WordPress, even if you 
don't have hosting, or most of the popular hosting  
06:30 - providers have a way to install WordPress, it 
just can be slightly different. Depending on what  
06:36 - hosting provider you get. After the website is set 
up, you may go right into the place where you're  
06:41 - managing it. But if not, you can always go back 
to the homepage here and hosting or and then click  
06:46 - Manage. Now in this page is going to give you 
all the information about your page like the IP  
06:52 - address. And it's like the domain name, and the 
name servers. And also, if you're using a hosting  
07:01 - provider that's not hosting her, there's probably 
a page that looks kind of like this, which is  
07:06 - where you actually install WordPress. So you 
will probably get into some sort of managing site  
07:11 - just like this. And there will likely be a button 
somewhere down here that says Install WordPress or  
07:18 - says WordPress or something like that. So if you 
can't, if you don't install WordPress, when you're  
07:23 - originally setting up your page, there may be some 
other way to do it. But once you have installed  
07:28 - WordPress, then it's pretty straightforward. 
I'm going to click on Dashboard right here.  
07:35 - And then once I'm get to dashboard, 
I'm just going to click Edit website.  
07:40 - We purchased the domain name and hosting 
and installed WordPress and WooCommerce.  
07:44 - Now let's customize the store. Now let me 
minimize the page a little bit. So you can  
07:49 - actually see the URL bar here. Now, whenever 
you create any sort of WordPress website,  
07:56 - to get to the admin page, where you actually 
make all the edits on your WordPress site,  
08:01 - it's always the same, it's going to 
be the URL that you previously chose.  
08:05 - And it's going to be slash WP dash admin. 
And then when you get to that, you'll log  
08:11 - in. Now I'm already logged in. But if you're not 
logged in, you'll be logged into the admin page.  
08:16 - And then you can start making changes on your 
WordPress account. As soon as we get into here,  
08:21 - there'll be some special notifications, it 
talks about setting up the website analytics,  
08:26 - and it says Welcome to WordPress, well, we 
can just dismiss that some of these you can  
08:29 - just dismiss now this one, your store does 
not appear to be using a secure connection.  
08:35 - This is important, especially when you're going 
to create a store, you want it to be over a secure  
08:40 - connection. It says we highly recommend serving 
your entire website over an HTTPS connection.  
08:46 - Now let me show you how to do that. So I'm 
gonna go back to the hosting or admin page,  
08:51 - and look where it says force HTTPS, redirect all 
websites over HTTPS. So I'm going to turn that on.  
08:59 - And then it's going to allow us to install the SSL 
certificate. Now pretty much all hosting providers  
09:04 - are going to give you this option somewhere. 
But it could be in a different place. So I'm  
09:09 - going to say install SSL. Now it says HTTPS 
will be automatically forced on your domain.  
09:16 - So instead of HTTP colon slash slash, it's 
at https colon slash slash robot attire.com.  
09:23 - S means secure. So we'll close that. And now 
I'll just go back over here. If I just refresh  
09:31 - this it's gonna let me log in again, because 
now we're in the secure version of the website.  
09:42 - Now you can see this lock is six one, 
the secure version of the website.  
09:45 - And if we click this, you'll see 
connection is secure. So we're  
09:49 - in HTTPS, which is good, and we don't 
see that warning anymore over here.  
09:55 - Okay, before we start setting things up, let's 
see what the website actually Looks like with all  
10:01 - the default settings here. So I'm just going 
to click where it says, I'm going to mouse  
10:06 - over where it says robot attire.com and click 
Visit Site. Okay, so this is the default site,  
10:16 - I'm going to go back to the admin page. And then 
this time, I'm gonna try going to visit store.  
10:24 - Okay, so this is the default store. Now, 
obviously, the site, the store don't look  
10:28 - anything like what we want to look like, we're 
going to be doing a lot of updating. So I'm going  
10:33 - to show you how to edit this site. So it looks 
exactly how we want to look. And now you can see  
10:38 - this top bar here. That's because we're logged 
into WordPress. And it just anybody that goes  
10:44 - to a website isn't going to see this top bar. But 
since we're logged into WordPress, we see that top  
10:48 - bar because we're the administrator, so we can do 
special things like at Site customize, I'm going  
10:54 - to show you what all these things are later. But 
if we go back into the URL, we can see this is  
10:58 - the shop URL, but we can go back to the main URL 
just by changing the URL in here. So I'm going to  
11:04 - show you how to update all this to be exactly 
what we want to look exactly how we want to  
11:09 - look. But first, let's go back into the dashboard. 
Before we saw what the website already looks like,  
11:14 - and it didn't look that nice. So we are going to 
install a theme and a template to just get a basic  
11:21 - look for our site. And then we can customize it. 
Now a lot of these things that I'm going to show  
11:25 - you the order doesn't really matter like we could 
set up, we could do the WooCommerce setup now.  
11:30 - But we're going to do that in a little bit. We 
are going to right now go to appearance. And let  
11:36 - me just zoom in a little more, so it's easier to 
see everything. Anytime you're using WordPress,  
11:40 - you're going to use some sort of theme. Now, 
it has this 2022 As a default theme here.  
11:46 - But there's tons of different themes that you can 
use. I'm just gonna close that for now. And then  
11:52 - I'm going to go to add new theme. So there's a 
bunch of really good thing like Astra I think  
11:57 - this is one of the most popular themes out there. 
With Ocean WP, I showed how to use this in my  
12:03 - previous WordPress tutorial. For this one, 
we're going to use one called Block C. Now,  
12:10 - a lot of the themes work well with E commerce 
sites. But this one in particular, I found  
12:15 - has a lot of good features for E commerce sites, 
I'm just going to go and install that theme.  
12:22 - And then after it's installed, 
just click Activate.  
12:27 - And then I'm going to install the block 
C companion. It says right here that it  
12:33 - includes custom extensions, demo templates, and 
many, many other awesome features. And we're going  
12:38 - to be using one of the the demo templates. 
So let's install the block C companion.  
12:43 - Okay. Now if you want to, if you want 
to give them all this extra information,  
12:47 - you can but I'm just going to skip there. But if 
you want to allow and continue you can. And now  
12:52 - I'm going to go to starter sites. So what's cool 
is that has all these starter sites that you can  
12:58 - install for free. So we can install one of these 
starter sites. And then we can go through and  
13:03 - edit it as much as we want. So we can use one 
of these sites as our base site. And then we  
13:09 - can then customize it to meet us our to meet our 
exact needs. So you're going to want to go through  
13:16 - all these and try to figure out which one looks 
most similar to what you want your website to be.  
13:22 - Well, I'm going to just choose this garter robe, 
I kind of like that already focuses on clothing.  
13:30 - And my site is going to focus on clothing. But 
you can use any of these. And you can make, like,  
13:35 - for example, see, this one's called Petzi, you 
can use Petzi, even if you're not going to be  
13:40 - having a website focused on Petzi or focus 
on pets. Because once we get this installed,  
13:47 - we can do a bunch of edits and 
make it custom for our specific  
13:51 - use case. So I'm going to import this one. 
And then we'll install the child theme also.  
13:57 - And then we can choose which page builder we 
want to use. There's the Gutenberg page builder  
14:02 - and Elementor page builder. Now Gutenberg is the 
default page builder that comes with WordPress  
14:08 - in Elementor. Is is an is an extra page where like 
an add on a special page builder. And most people  
14:14 - agree that Elementor is a little easier to use. 
So if you're a beginner, I would recommend using  
14:20 - Elementor. And I'm going to show you how to use 
it later in this course. So just click next here,  
14:26 - and it's going to install Elementor WooCommerce 
is already installed. And then it's going to  
14:30 - install WP forms. So let's click Next. We'll just 
import all the content and install everything.  
14:37 - Ok, Starter Site imported successfully. So let's 
view the site. Okay, so remember what our site  
14:45 - looked like before. Well now this is what it looks 
like. So the Starter Site included some images,  
14:52 - and then it has all these things. It even 
has some sample products right in here.  
14:56 - And I'm going to show you in a little bit how to 
update all these how to Change all these things  
15:01 - to your products in your images. But it's 
nice just to have something to start with,  
15:07 - that we can customize for our purposes. And you 
can see all the text is just lorem ipsum. So it's  
15:14 - a sample text that will will update with our 
own products. So one thing, let's go up here,  
15:21 - and I'm just going to click on a product. So you 
can see what it looks like. If we click on here,  
15:25 - we can see the product page. And you can see 
this on sale, not only $30. Now it's $45.  
15:32 - And it even has a review. So users are going 
to be able to enter their own reviews for your  
15:41 - for your store when they buy products, 
and it shows the top rated products.  
15:48 - And then we can even see what happens if we add 
this to cart. So let's just add this to the cart,  
15:54 - view the cart. And then we even have a checkout 
cart here. And you can have coupon codes,  
16:02 - then we can proceed to checkout, 
and even taken the billing details.  
16:12 - And it says right here, sorry, it seems that there 
are no available payment methods for your state,  
16:19 - we're going to have to set up the payment methods, 
which I'll show you how to do. And I can't even  
16:24 - show you what it's like to place order until 
we get the payment methods. Right now we have  
16:29 - invalid payment methods. Because we don't even we 
haven't even set up any payment methods. But let's  
16:33 - see what else we have. We have the products. And 
you can see on the main product page, we actually  
16:40 - have a filter, you can filter by price. And we 
can see the different products, we have services,  
16:46 - which will be custom will be specific to your 
store. And you may not even need this page.  
16:51 - Depending on what store you're trying to create. 
You may want to show what special services your  
16:57 - store offers. And then there's the about us page, 
there's a news page. This is basically a blog.  
17:04 - And so we can see all these sample blog 
entries here and then a contact page.  
17:13 - And you can see how it's always giving 
products trying to sell things on every page.  
17:19 - And then we can even search for things. 
So I'm going to search for a hat.  
17:26 - Okay, they came up with nothing. Let's try 
a watch, I saw that there's definitely a  
17:29 - watching the sample products here. 
And even comes up right here.  
17:35 - Okay, so people can search 
for the products they want.  
17:40 - So this is a pretty nice store here. So now let's 
see how to customize it. So it's specific to your  
17:47 - store your product and what you want it to look 
like. So let's go back to the dashboard. Soon I'm  
17:56 - going to show you how to customize your store and 
add custom products. But first, let's finish this  
18:00 - WooCommerce setup. So I'm going to click start 
selling. And it's going to guide us through some  
18:06 - setup things. First, we're going to going to put 
our address, if you look right here, it says this  
18:10 - is going to help configure currency options and 
shipping rules automatically. And this will not be  
18:16 - publicly visible and can be easily changed later. 
So you don't have to enter, enter this, you can  
18:22 - set up the shipping rules and currency manually. 
But I'm just going to enter some information here.  
18:30 - And then you can choose what are you going to 
sell physical products, downloadable products  
18:34 - or subscriptions? I'm just gonna do physical 
products and downloads and then continue  
18:44 - and then you choose like how many 
products you're going to have  
18:54 - and then they they try kind of upsell you it's 
not it's It's actually free plugins, but they  
18:59 - try to suggest what are the things you want to add 
for now we're not going to add any of those. And  
19:06 - we can always add things later. And then it's 
going to ask you if you want to to this theme,  
19:12 - but we already did that. So let's 
continue with the active theme.  
19:17 - In we're gonna come back to all this in a 
little bit the setting up payments, taxes  
19:21 - shipping, we're after we customize our store, 
we're gonna come back and set up all these things.  
19:27 - Now let's go back to the on the side, we have the 
WooCommerce and we're gonna go to settings, and  
19:32 - you're probably going to want to update some 
of the settings in here. So selling locations,  
19:37 - where do you want to sell to? This may change 
depending on what do you want to ship to like you  
19:42 - can actually type in different specific countries 
sell to specific countries. And then you can just  
19:49 - type in type in the countries here like let's see, 
I'm going to sell to the United States of Canada  
19:59 - and ZICO. That way don't have to ship across an 
ocean. Or you can just choose all countries or  
20:07 - whatever countries you want to sell to. And then 
shipping locations. So sell the specific coming  
20:12 - countries, that means we're selling to people 
that are there live in specific countries,  
20:16 - but you may not want to ship to the 
same locations that you're selling to,  
20:20 - it's usually going to be the same. That's why the 
default is shipped to all countries you sell to,  
20:25 - and the default customer location. Where 
do you think most people are going to  
20:30 - be? Now you could do geo locate, if you click geo 
locate, the browser will try to figure out where  
20:37 - the user is located. And then we'll set the 
default location to wherever the browser  
20:44 - says they're currently located. So I'm actually 
just going to do shop Country region, so it will  
20:49 - default to the United States where I'm from. And 
then I am going to enable tax rate calculations  
20:54 - that we'll set up more later able to use a coupon 
code, you can decide whether you want to do that.  
21:00 - And then you can choose the currency options. So 
I'll just save changes for this. Now go to the  
21:08 - Products page. Some of the things you're gonna 
want to choose here are the weight units. Well,  
21:12 - since I'm in the United States, I'll choose 
pounds, but probably most people are going to  
21:16 - choose kilograms. If you're somewhere else in the 
world dimension units, I'll just choose inches.  
21:22 - And you can choose if you want enable reviews, 
if you want to enable star rating, other save  
21:28 - what we have here, and then you're probably 
going to want to go to inventory here too.  
21:33 - And so in inventory, you can determine whether 
you're going to enable stock management. So  
21:39 - I can just turn that off. And we won't ever 
tell how much you have in stock. Or you can  
21:43 - set all these things based on when something 
is low stock when something is out of stock,  
21:48 - you can also change things for the downloadable 
products. And for the down little products,  
21:54 - you can determine whether you have to 
download, you can do downloads Require Login,  
22:00 - are you going to grant access to downloadable 
products after payment, you're likely going  
22:05 - to want to say keep all this as the default 
settings. But you can change it if you want.  
22:11 - Now tax we're going to talk more about tax 
later. But you can see there's settings for tax  
22:18 - shipping, we're gonna set payments for the store 
later. And then accounts and privacy. Do you want  
22:26 - to allow customers to place order without an 
account, probably you want to give customers  
22:31 - as much freedom and flexibility as possible. 
So they'll be more likely to go through and buy  
22:36 - products allow I'm going to allow customers 
to create an account while customers create an  
22:42 - account on the My Account page we want them to 
be just do as much as they possibly can. Yeah,  
22:48 - we want them to be able to log into an existing 
countering checkout if they have an account.  
22:53 - And then here, it's going to link to 
the privacy policy, which we are going  
22:58 - to be able to create later. And then let's go to 
emails, oops, I've got 10. Remember to save this.  
23:11 - So here are where you can see the emails that 
are sent out when someone makes an order,  
23:18 - and you can update what emails are sent 
out based on different things happening  
23:22 - in your store. And the rest of this we won't do 
anything with. So let's go back to our dashboard.  
23:30 - Now I'm going to teach you how to customize 
your site. So it's specific to your brand.  
23:34 - So I'm going to go back into Visit Site. 
And I'm going to show you how to customize  
23:39 - every part of this site. And then afterwards, 
I'll show you how to add your custom items.  
23:45 - While we're customizing the site, we're just 
going to use all the sample items and sample  
23:48 - data that's already there. But then afterwards, 
we'll delete all the sample data. So we can start  
23:53 - adding your real products. So if you remember, 
we installed the Elementor page builder, that's  
23:59 - what I'm going to show you how to use now. So in 
this top bar when I click edit with Elementor.  
24:06 - And if you get this depending on how you 
set your site, you may have to recreate  
24:10 - the kit. So we'll do that now. We're going 
to recreate the kit and then save changes.  
24:16 - You may not even have to do that step. 
But now let me go back to the site.  
24:20 - And then edit with Elementor. There's always new 
versions of Elementor. So you may get something  
24:25 - telling you about some new version of Elementor. 
But you can just click through that got it. So  
24:31 - now we can see the site. And then over on the 
left side are all the different elements we can  
24:35 - edit with. But look what we can do. But we can 
actually click any of these elements and start  
24:40 - editing. So it says brand new collection will I 
can actually just select this. And then I'm going  
24:46 - to type in robots, robot clothes are fun. And you 
can put anything you want here your store slogan,  
24:57 - or this is just for fun. I'm just kind of giving 
you example here, but you can change what this  
25:02 - looks like, I can go to style. So I can actually 
change the color if I want to change it to a  
25:08 - specific color. Or even better if you don't 
want to, instead of just picking any color,  
25:14 - it's better if your site has specific colors, 
you don't want to use tons of colors everywhere,  
25:19 - you want to stick to just a few colors on your 
whole site. So that's easy to do by I can click  
25:25 - one of these global colors. I'm going to do theme 
color for but later I'll show you how to change  
25:32 - those theme colors. So when you change the theme 
colors, and all the places like for instance,  
25:37 - one of the theme colors is red. And if I change 
the theme color to a different color, all the red  
25:41 - will change to a different color. But for now, 
I'm going to continue doing some edits on here.  
25:46 - So here is where you can change the font size, 
weight and all this stuff, you can change the  
25:53 - style, like if it's bold, or italicized, 
I'm actually going to change this to normal.  
25:58 - And then I'm going to make this a little smaller, 
because I want this to just be on two lines. And  
26:04 - you can even change like the line height how 
much space is between the lines, letter spacing.  
26:11 - And there's just a lot of different settings you 
can you can change to make it so it works for your  
26:16 - specific brand. You can even add a text shadow. So 
that's what I'm going to try adding a shadow here.  
26:23 - And we can kind of change where 
the shadow is going to be.  
26:27 - And you don't have to edit shadows just some 
interesting things that make it stand out and make  
26:32 - it specific to your your store. So I'm gonna go 
to Advanced here. And this is where you can change  
26:38 - different margin. So margin is going to be so 
margin and padding are both going to have to  
26:43 - do with how much space are around the words. So 
I'm going to change the the margin on the side.  
26:49 - And you can see it's all going together because 
it's locked. But if we unlink the values, then  
26:54 - we can just change one or you don't have to change 
them all at the same time. So I can put this back  
27:00 - to zero, this can be zero, and then we can just 
change the left margin to go to the side. And it's  
27:06 - gonna work the same with padding. So if I unlink, 
this, I can change the padding on the left side.  
27:14 - And then there's all these other things, you can 
do that to the text like any of this stuff here,  
27:18 - you can do to any text on the whole page. So you 
can make an interest animation so it fades in.  
27:24 - So as soon as you scroll down to see these 
words, the text can fade in. And there's  
27:31 - all these different options we can make it 
bounce in, we can make it slide to the left.  
27:37 - And you're probably not going to want to do 
that for your main title. But this is just an  
27:41 - example. Because you can go through in every text 
like this new arrivals, you can make it slide in  
27:46 - as soon as the person scrolls down. So you can 
just experiment with all these different settings,  
27:53 - you can like for instance, you can change 
the background. So we can put an image in  
27:58 - the background, or we can do a specific 
color, so I can make it a red background.  
28:05 - I'll clear that though. Or you can actually put 
an image in the background like for instance,  
28:09 - over here we have a background image. And I'll 
show you how to change that for a little bit.  
28:13 - So there's these all these different things to 
easily customize it to be exactly how you want it.  
28:19 - So here we can see these three different 
things with three different icons. Well,  
28:23 - instead of a checkmark, I want to 
change this icon, I'm gonna go to the  
28:26 - icon library. And I can change this I 
can, let's see, where's the search here.  
28:31 - Obviously, I'm going to choose a robot for the 
icon because this is all about robot clothes.  
28:37 - And I can change this, I can do 
the same thing for all these icons.  
28:43 - Now I'm going to show you some settings that 
change stuff on your whole site. So if I click the  
28:49 - this hamburger menu, I can go to Site Settings. 
So here you can change things that are going to  
28:55 - impact things all over your site. Now depending 
on what your theme is, it may not change things,  
29:01 - because you may have a theme that overrides some 
of these settings. But some things are pretty  
29:06 - important, like the site identity, let's go to 
site identity, I'm going to change this site  
29:10 - name will show up in the top bar of your website. 
So insert my URL here, I'm gonna be called robot  
29:17 - tire. And then a site description. This is 
something that could show up on some search  
29:22 - engines, and then some other places. So instead of 
putting just another WordPress site, I'm gonna say  
29:28 - best place best store for robot attire. And then 
logo. This is where we can change our logo. So to  
29:41 - switch the logo on the site, we're just going to 
click here the Choose Image. First, you have to  
29:45 - have your logo made, I would recommend a site like 
fiverr.com where you can hire someone to make a  
29:51 - a logo for you for $5. I've actually used 
that for some other sites that I've created,  
29:56 - but also sometimes I just create my own logos. 
In this case I I've already created a logo.  
30:01 - So I'm gonna just go to choose 
image. And I'm going to upload it.  
30:05 - And I'm going to select it and it's uploading. 
And I will, I'll just put a logo. And then here's  
30:13 - where you can also add a favicon. That's the 
icon that will appear on the tab on your browser.  
30:20 - So you can choose an icon, there's plenty of 
websites that you can go to that you can upload  
30:26 - a picture, and it will, it will give you a favicon 
file that you can upload right into here. So what  
30:34 - I'm going to do is update the site settings. 
And hopefully we'll see it right on here.  
30:39 - Now we can see that the logo didn't change 
in WordPress, because of how the page builder  
30:44 - works together with the theme works together 
with just the standard WordPress design,  
30:51 - there could be multiple places to change different 
things. And depending on what theme you're using,  
30:58 - the only way to find out for sure how to change 
things is through trial and error. So we can see  
31:04 - that changing the site logo here did not change 
the logo, there's one other place we can change.  
31:08 - And when we go to this other place, there's 
actually quite a few other things we can  
31:12 - change there. So let me show you how to get to 
there. So what we're gonna do is just close this.  
31:17 - And then I'm going to click the little hamburger 
menu and then click Exit to dashboard. And then  
31:22 - we just need to go to this the WordPress logo 
here. And now we go to appearance. And under  
31:30 - Appearance I'm going to go to Customize, this 
is going to enable a whole new section of things  
31:37 - that we can customize. So I'm going to go to the 
header because we're changing the header here.  
31:43 - And then you can see it's showing different things 
we have here. So eight, when it says the top row,  
31:49 - that's this row appear, this is the top row where 
it says Don't miss our holiday offer 20% off, and  
31:55 - then it has the the social media things. And then 
we have the main row here, which so it says logo,  
32:01 - and then it has the menu, it has the search 
account card, that's the search account card  
32:05 - over here. So I'm just going to click where 
it says menu. Now you can see the logo here,  
32:10 - this is the old logo, I'm going to click this edit 
button. And then I can just choose the new logo.  
32:19 - Okay, now we see the new logo right up here. 
And there's different settings you can do,  
32:23 - we can change the height of the logo, so too big.  
32:31 - And you can change how it's aligned. Now, while 
we're on this page, let me show you what some of  
32:36 - the other things you can do. Okay, so let's now 
change this top bar here. So one thing I want  
32:44 - to do is change the social media. So if I click 
social media here, here's where we can add what  
32:49 - social media we want to add, like, we may not 
want to, we may not want to have a phone number,  
32:53 - we probably want to have an email. So I'm just 
going to have, I'm just going to have Twitter  
32:58 - and Facebook. And then as you can see, they go 
away here. Now we only have the two links here.  
33:04 - And then it says, configure the social links in 
general layout social network accounts. So let  
33:09 - me show you how to do that. We're going to go back 
here, General, and then social network accounts.  
33:17 - And there's all these, you can just add what your 
social network account is here. So for email,  
33:24 - I'll just put my email address, and then we can 
go back to the other one, which is the Twitter.  
33:30 - And you can add, and I'll just put HTTP s, 
colon, slash slash twitter.com/beau Carnes,  
33:40 - but you may have a social media account directly 
for your your store. And then here's some other  
33:47 - things we can do. I am going to go back here. 
And this is a pretty important thing here.  
33:54 - If I go to Where's oh, I need to go back 
again. And then we go to colors. This is where  
34:02 - you can change the colors throughout your whole 
store. Now I decided to go ahead and use the red.  
34:08 - That's why I made the logo red there. But if you 
don't want to see all these buttons that are red,  
34:13 - if I go into this color palette, or actually not 
there, if I just actually click this color color  
34:20 - one, I can change this to blue, and see every 
place on the site that was red is now blue.  
34:31 - See, and then you can change see that red 
there? Well, let's go to Color to I think  
34:36 - that could be the hover color. Let's find if I 
change the green. Let's see what now if I hover  
34:42 - now it's going to hover as green and 
see where this gray here that kind of  
34:47 - looks like this. Let's see if I change this. 
What happens if I change this to red? Oh no,  
34:53 - but it did change this text down here. We'll 
keep that and see even this becomes blue here  
34:59 - but since I have the red as the logo, I'm 
going to change the main color back to red.  
35:04 - But you can change the colors for your website 
to match whatever you have as your logo.  
35:11 - And then you can see you can change the color of 
different things here, the different headings,  
35:16 - what color the links are going to be. 
But I'm gonna go back over here. So here,  
35:22 - you can change the header and the footer, and 
stuff like that. But to really change the header,  
35:28 - you can just click here and change the 
header, because if I click on menu here,  
35:33 - it's not going to change the menu items. So if 
I want to change the menu items in the header,  
35:38 - there's somewhere else I have to do, I have to 
go to do that. So let me click publish. So we  
35:44 - published with our new color and the logo here. 
And then I'm going to hit X to go out of this,  
35:49 - when we go back over here. Now if I go to 
Appearance, Menus, this is where we can choose  
35:58 - what things show up in the menu, we're not going 
to show services. So I'm going to remove services,  
36:05 - I'm going to remove news. And we're just going 
to have the products, the Home Products about us  
36:13 - and contact. So the real thing that 
a lot of you care about is the shop  
36:16 - page. So let's just quickly show you how to 
edit the about us page and the contact page.  
36:20 - And then we will go to the shop page. So I'm 
going to go back to visiting the site. And now if  
36:33 - we go to about us. Now here on the About Us page,  
36:39 - you can just edit it just like we had the 
other page, I'm going to edit with Elementor.  
36:48 - And I'm just going to delete this entire 
section here, I'm just going to the x bar here.  
36:53 - And you can see there, this top section is really 
big. Now that I deleted that little section this,  
37:02 - this about us thing, there's a lot of 
space down here. So I'm going to go here  
37:06 - to this Edit section. Nowhere style.  
37:16 - X will go to advanced. And you can see 
the padding, the padding is why there's  
37:20 - so much blank space here, I'm just 
going to change this to zero. So 00.  
37:27 - And then we have teams, you can change that these 
pictures, you can change this text to your team  
37:32 - names, you can update and remove things just like 
we did on the other page. Okay, let's go to the  
37:39 - contact page. Oh, and before I forget that, when 
you make changes, it doesn't actually make the  
37:45 - changes until you click update. So I'm gonna 
click the Update down here. And then we'll go  
37:50 - to the contact page. So here's our contact form. 
Now you can edit with Elementor, just like we've  
37:55 - seen, but let me show you how you would 
actually edit what fields are in this form.  
38:00 - I'm going to go up to WP forms right here. And 
I'm going to a simple contact form, edit form.  
38:07 - Now I can add things to remove things like phone, 
we don't need to know the person's phone number.  
38:13 - Okay, we do need to know that email address. 
And I can get something new like I mean,  
38:18 - when I use some checkboxes, I'm going to 
click this checkbox and drag it over here.  
38:27 - And then I can edit it. So reason 
for contact website, question. Sales  
38:42 - want a cookie. Now I can save that. But before I 
go back to my contact page, I'm going to settings  
38:51 - and notifications. And make sure this is on. 
Sometimes we'll be off you want to make sure these  
38:58 - notifications are on. And this is going 
to send to your admin email address.  
39:06 - So I'm going to save this will access now I'll 
go back to my contact page. And we'll try it out  
39:24 - and I do want a cookie. Hello. Now click Send 
Message. Now go to my email address. This is  
39:32 - info at robot attire.com which is my current admin 
email. Go in here. And here. I want a cookie.  
39:38 - Hello, I got the email. Well, that works. Let's 
check out this header. There's still some menu  
39:45 - items that I thought were removed. So let me go 
back over to the dashboard. Appearance Menus. And  
39:53 - I did not save the menu last time that was 
the problem. So let me Move this, move that.  
40:07 - And then we'll save the menu. And 
this time, it will hopefully work.  
40:15 - Okay, that looks good. Okay, we finally reached 
the part you've been waiting for the product  
40:22 - page. So let me show you how you can change 
the product page. Now you can see there is no  
40:30 - edit with Elementor up here. So we can only click 
Customize. Now I'm going to scroll down here  
40:39 - to where it says WooCommerce. The 
product page is through WooCommerce.  
40:44 - So here we can change things like the 
other three columns here, well, what I  
40:48 - can add additional columns of products, I can 
do two columns. And then we can change how many  
40:55 - rows right now there are four rows, 
we may want to only have three rows.  
41:02 - You can also change the fiscal, what 
type of the shop is going to look like.  
41:10 - There's some just some minor differences between 
each of these styles. And we can change how it's  
41:16 - going to sort what kind of sidebar we're going 
to have. So right now we have the filter, we can,  
41:23 - we can filter. So we can just show the products. 
Or we can turn back on the sidebar, we can filter  
41:29 - by different but in different ways. So you can go 
through here and change things, I'm going to turn  
41:34 - off this page title. So when you click products, 
it's going to go right to the store page right  
41:40 - here. And another thing we're going you can do 
from here is change what a single product page  
41:46 - looks like. So let me go into this black T shirt 
product page. And we can change what this product  
41:53 - page looks like. So here's some things we can see 
what the top rated products is on one side, we can  
42:00 - click here to make it switch sides. Maybe we don't 
want that top rated products, we can turn that off  
42:06 - by clicking the narrow width, I'm going to 
go back to the the right sidebar one and  
42:12 - then see sale bad. So see how it says 
sale up there, we can turn that off  
42:18 - and turn it back on, we can choose whether it's 
gonna show the star rating, the metadata, and go  
42:24 - to product gallery. And I can change see how it 
zooms I go over it? Well, I can turn that off. So  
42:31 - now when I scroll over is not going to zoom into 
the product. So you can play around with these  
42:36 - settings until you get your product page looking 
exactly how you want to look how you want to look.  
42:43 - Okay, when you're editing a product page, 
let me show you how you would edit these,  
42:48 - the sidebar here. And then also the reviews. 
Well, the reviews, I already actually showed  
42:53 - you a while back how to turn on and off reviews 
that's in the WooCommerce settings, you can  
42:59 - say you can turn off reviews for everything 
or turn on reviews for everything right now  
43:05 - they're turned on, let me show you how you 
would update this sidebar right here. Because  
43:10 - I don't really like this black box right 
here. I do kind of like the related products,  
43:14 - but I don't like this new cloth technologies 
box. So to do that, I'm going to have to go  
43:21 - to the the main WordPress dashboard, I'm gonna go 
to Appearance and Widgets, that sidebar is under  
43:28 - widgets. So the specific widget 
is actually this WooCommerce  
43:35 - sidebar, and we have the top RED project 
products that we saw on here. And then we had  
43:41 - this whole thing right here. So I'm just going 
to click this, and then click Delete. So now  
43:48 - we're only going to have the top rated products 
and see when I click into top rated products,  
43:52 - you can choose what the title of this 
is gonna be, how many products to show,  
43:56 - and stuff like that. And also, I'm gonna 
go up here and I'm also going to delete  
44:00 - this in the main sidebar, I'm going to 
delete this black thing right here. And  
44:04 - then you can add anything else you want to the 
sidebar, and then I'm going to click update.  
44:11 - Now we can go back over to that. Oh, really 
quick, I'll show you one more time how you  
44:15 - would turn off the the comments. If you go to 
WooCommerce settings here, and then you go to  
44:23 - products, and then you can disable that 
enable product reviews, you can turn off.  
44:29 - Okay, we'll just go back to here Visit Site. 
Now if we go back to a product page. Now we  
44:36 - don't have that black thing right there. 
Another thing we can do is change what the  
44:42 - shopping cart looks like. So I'm going 
to click the shopping cart right here.  
44:48 - So we can go to the checkout page, and they can 
click Proceed to Checkout here. And now we can  
44:56 - we can change what the checkout page looks like. 
Like for instance, I can turn on the coupon form.  
45:05 - And now, people can choose if they have a 
coupon they can do click here to enter the code.  
45:12 - And then you can check, like 
what's going to be required here.  
45:15 - And you can, you can also choose what, what's 
gonna show up about your privacy policy. And  
45:21 - this is the link to the privacy policy page, which 
we still have to edit, I'm actually going to open  
45:27 - up this into a new tab really quick, so I can, so 
we can show you how to edit the privacy policy.  
45:35 - So to edit this privacy policy, I'm going 
to go back into the main WordPress menu,  
45:42 - I'm going to go to pages. And then I'm going 
to find the privacy policy page, edit this.  
45:55 - And now we can add the privacy policy, I'm 
just going to use all the suggested text.  
46:02 - So I'm just going to delete 
where it says suggested text.  
46:08 - And then I can click publish. Okay, now I want to 
make sure I'm using this right, privacy policy my  
46:17 - my checkout page, let's go back to the checkout 
page. And there's a few privacy, I'm gonna  
46:23 - choose this first privacy policy. And then we'll 
just click it to make sure it's the right one.  
46:30 - Okay, that's the right one. And then make sure 
you click Publish here. So any changes, you always  
46:36 - want to click Publish to make sure all the changes 
happen, that ecommerce site is starting to look  
46:40 - pretty good. Now let's see how to add products 
to the store. So in order to add some custom  
46:45 - products, we're going to go back to the main, the 
main dashboard. And I'm going to click where it  
46:51 - says products here for do this, so it keeps saying 
keep suggesting that we connect monster insights,  
46:58 - a setup website analytics. Now if we click here, 
it's going to go, it's going to actually walk us  
47:02 - through all the steps that's outside the scope 
of this particular tutorial. So I should have  
47:07 - done this earlier. But what I'm going to do 
is, is delete this plugin, so we don't have  
47:13 - to keep seeing it, we're going to go to plugins. 
So before you can delete a pro plug in, you have  
47:18 - to deactivate it. So I'm going to deactivate 
this plugin, and then I am going to check it.  
47:27 - And then I'm going to just click Delete. 
And then if I refresh this page, oh,  
47:35 - and to get I guess there's one more thing 
we have to remove, let's deactivate this.  
47:44 - And then delete it.  
47:48 - Now, it's no longer showing that message. 
Good. So let's go back to the products again.  
47:54 - The first thing we're going to do is just remove 
all the products that are currently there.  
48:02 - So I'm just going to click this. And then we 
are going to move to trash. And click Apply.  
48:10 - Okay, now we can just start 
adding some products from scratch.  
48:16 - So the first type of product I'm going to 
teach you how to create is a simple product.  
48:22 - So this is a simple product, it has a picture, 
sometimes there can be additional pictures below,  
48:28 - we only have one picture for this one, it has 
a title as a description, and then down here,  
48:33 - it's going to have a more detailed description. 
So let me show you how you create a product like  
48:39 - this. It's simple, because there are no options 
that you would have to choose. So let's go back  
48:45 - to the main dashboard. So I'm going to click 
add new to add a new product, robot hat.  
48:55 - And then we can add the description. So 
this description is the description that  
49:00 - appears second on the page, that will just contain 
additional information about the product because  
49:06 - the user will have already read a description. 
And so this could be like made in the USA,  
49:13 - you will not want to return this. And then if 
we scroll down here to this other description,  
49:23 - this is the description that the customer 
will see first, the short description.  
49:27 - So I'm just going to paste in a description 
for the robot hat. I'm gonna go back up here  
49:34 - and make sure we have simple product chosen 
here. It's not virtual or downloadable,  
49:39 - but we could make a downloadable product. 
And then we can put the full price but $50  
49:45 - and then we can put the sale price we can also 
schedule how long the sale is going to happen for  
49:53 - so I can say that it's going to start today, 
and it's going to go for a week. So then after  
49:59 - That time is up, it won't show that sales price 
anymore. So let's go to inventory, you can have  
50:05 - a SKU number if you have a specific number for 
the product, and then there's also manage stock.  
50:10 - So if you have managed stock, you'll keep track 
of how much you have in stock. So I can say 10.  
50:16 - And then if you have a stock on the product page 
will actually tell how many are left in stock.  
50:23 - And then do you want to allow people to purchase 
it after it's not in stock and create a backorder.  
50:29 - And then you can also choose if you want to 
be sold individually. And then you can put  
50:34 - information about the shipping, like the weight, 
the dimensions, and then you can choose a shipping  
50:39 - class was we don't have any setup right now. Also, 
you can choose linked products. Now remember,  
50:46 - on the product page where there was some products 
on the side, there's products on the bottom,  
50:50 - this is where you set those products. Now I don't 
actually, this is the first product I'm creating.  
50:56 - So I don't have anything to add. But once you 
add a bunch of products, you can select which  
51:01 - things are going to be considered upsells, in 
which things are going to be considered cross  
51:05 - sells. So it will suggest the other products 
to users at various times. And then we have  
51:11 - attributes which we will talk more later when we 
get to some of these other types of products. And  
51:16 - then advance a purchase note is a note that will 
be sent to the customer after they purchase it.  
51:23 - Now menu order, this changes how far up in on 
your page will show. So when you have a bunch  
51:29 - of different products on your page, the lower 
this number, the higher it appears on the page.  
51:37 - So the products you want to show to the user the 
most you want to have a lower number. And we have  
51:44 - the reviews enabled for all the products, 
but you can turn off reviews for individual  
51:48 - products here. And then we already talked about 
this description. Okay, the next thing we're going  
51:54 - to do is add the product image. So go up here, set 
a product image. And I'm going to upload a file.  
52:06 - And here's my product image, this robot hat. And 
then if you have other images, that won't be the  
52:13 - main image, you can add them here the product 
gallery images, product tags, you want to give  
52:17 - similar items, the same tag, like I'll add hat 
for this. And then if we add any other hats,  
52:24 - we'll use the same tag. And then people can click 
the word hat, and they can see all the hats.  
52:32 - And then we're also going to add this to the 
accessories category. Now another thing to  
52:37 - just have all the accessories in the category 
all t shirts in the same category, and so on.  
52:44 - Now, I kind of skipped over this before, but this 
gives you information about SEO and you can change  
52:48 - the different descriptions and titles and 
and try to adjust the snippets are going to  
52:54 - appear on so on search engines and other places 
on the web. But we're not going to go into that  
52:59 - right now. Right now, I'm just gonna go and click 
publish. And we've now created a simple product.  
53:07 - Our product is created. So 
let's check it out. So it says  
53:11 - we can click on View Product right here. 
And we'll open up the product page.  
53:16 - So here's the hat here, we got the title we 
put in. And so as it's on sale, here's the  
53:21 - description, and we have 10 in stock. And then it 
shows our category and our tags here. If we click  
53:28 - accessory, we can see all the accessories. 
Currently there's no other accessories. But  
53:33 - we can go back to the product page. And then you 
can see here's the additional description here.  
53:38 - And here's three views, I can even leave a review 
right now. Best hat ever, and then click Submit.  
53:48 - And right now I'm logged in, it'll show the 
company I'm logged in at. So the your users will  
53:55 - be able to create their own account on the store, 
and then they will be able to leave reviews.  
54:02 - So we have our simple product. Now we're going to 
create a variable product. A variable product is  
54:08 - just a product where you can change the options. 
You can maybe change the color or change the size.  
54:12 - But like do you want to medium size a large size 
small size blue red. So let me show you how to  
54:18 - create a variable product, we could go back to the 
product page. But even right on this page, there's  
54:23 - a there's a new thing we can click on New and then 
product so we're creating a new product right now.  
54:30 - And I'm going to call this a robot shirt. We're 
going to have different colors and different  
54:35 - sizes of shirts. So to create a variable product 
we'll put in the description made in your country.  
54:45 - And we're going to go down and we can just 
put the the full description okay, we've got  
54:52 - the description. So now we're going to click it 
says symbol progress and click this and go to  
54:57 - variable product. So some of the is going 
to be the same. But now we are going to have  
55:02 - attributes and variations. So let's go to the 
attributes. And I'm going to add an attribute,  
55:10 - the first is going to be size. And then it says 
right here into some tax, and it shows to use  
55:17 - this to separate the attributes. This is 
not an eye, it's actually a vertical bar,  
55:23 - it's on your keyboard, right on the same key as 
the backslash. So I'm going to put small, medium,  
55:35 - large. Okay, I'll save the attribute. And then 
I'm going to add another one, which is going to be  
55:42 - color. And we'll do red, and blue. And I'll save 
this. Okay, so now I have a customer will be  
55:56 - to choose the size and the color of the shirt. 
Okay, so now I'm going to save the attributes.  
56:02 - Now go to variations, and it says you need 
to add some variations on the Attributes tab,  
56:07 - that we need to go back to the attributes. 
And there's one thing we forgot, which is  
56:11 - to click this button that says that says use 
for variations. And for color, let me put that  
56:17 - down use for variations. We'll save that. Now 
we'll go back to variations. And at this point,  
56:22 - we can click this drop down menu and 
create variations from all attributes.  
56:28 - And then I'll say are you sure you want 
to do this? Yes, we want to do that.  
56:32 - And it's added six variations. Okay, so it's added 
for every, it's added every size and every color.  
56:40 - Now here is where it gets kind of tedious, we're 
going to add to add information for every single  
56:47 - variation. So we are going so all these 
options are very similar to the simple product  
56:54 - options. And we're going to have to add these for 
every variation. So for price for the small, it's  
57:02 - going to be $20. In stock, you can add weights, 
if you want, we go up here and click this image,  
57:08 - we can upload an image. Now I'm going to upload 
a few files here. And I'm uploading a blue shirt,  
57:14 - a picture of a blue shirt and a picture of a red 
shirt. And then I'll set this as the variation.  
57:20 - So for this small red shirt, we're going to show 
the red shirt here. And then we have to go through  
57:26 - for all these other ones. So for the small blue 
shirt, I'm going to add the blue shirt here,  
57:31 - and it's going to be $20. And then we'll just keep 
going down here. And for the medium, it's going to  
57:41 - be the same, it's just going to select the same 
image, this time, I'm going to put a different  
57:46 - different price. So this is going to be $25. The 
meeting will be $25. This is just just to show  
57:50 - an example that you can use different prices 
and even different sale prices for different  
57:57 - different variations. I'll make the sale price. 
So this register is on sale. So I'll make this  
58:02 - 20 Let's say you have more of that type 
of shirt that you just need to get rid of.  
58:06 - And then we'll just go through 
and set the rest of these.  
58:13 - Okay, after we set all these variations, I'm 
going to save changes. And now we can add  
58:18 - everything that you add to the simple product. 
Like we can add tags, I'm going to put shirt,  
58:24 - and then I can also go to a category select 
teasers for the category. And then you're still  
58:30 - going to want to select a product image. When 
a product is initially shown on the store page,  
58:36 - before the customer can choose what type of color 
they're looking at, it's gonna have to show just a  
58:41 - single image. So this is the this is going to be 
the initial image that's going to be shown will  
58:45 - show the blue. And that reminded me one more 
thing. Let's go back over to the variations.  
58:54 - You can also set a default size and a default 
color to be selected. So we're going to put a  
58:58 - default size to medium and a default color to 
blue, just like it's showing the blue image.  
59:05 - Okay, now we can go up here, and we can publish.  
59:15 - Now let's view the product to see what this 
looks like. Okay, see, it's showing it could  
59:20 - be anywhere between 20 and $30, depending on 
which size and which color and you can see here's  
59:26 - the blue one. But if I go to a large, it's 
gonna it's going to change the price to 30.  
59:33 - If I change the color I continue to read, it 
should show the red shirt. And just like before,  
59:39 - well just just like before, we'll have 
reviews, there's even additional information,  
59:44 - it's going to show the different sizes 
possible and the different colors possible.  
59:49 - And you can see automatically is putting related 
products up here. So really I don't have there's  
59:55 - not really very many products so it's just 
going to show the products that we already have.  
59:59 - Now we're gonna To create a group product, a group 
product is a product where there's a few different  
60:04 - options. And each options come with different 
items. Like, say you're selling a camera,  
60:10 - and you'll have a product page for the camera, 
but you can select just the camera, or you can  
60:16 - select the camera in the bag, or you can select 
a camera bag and tripod. And each group of  
60:22 - each group of items under the product page will 
have different prices. So let's see how to do  
60:26 - that. I'm going to go to new product. So to 
make a group product, we have to make the main  
60:32 - product and then we have to create all the 
sub products that are within the group.  
60:37 - So since this is a robot tire store, what if we 
actually sold an actual robot or a robot toy, so  
60:43 - I'm going to put robot toy for the main product. 
And then we can just add the descriptions.  
60:55 - Okay, if we add the description, we can 
change the product to grouped product.  
61:00 - And then we can add categories. So I 
actually already add a new category  
61:06 - category called robot. And then you can add 
tags like Toy Fun, and then I'll just add those.  
61:14 - And then we will add an image. 
So I've already uploaded this  
61:18 - robot picture. So I'll set that as the 
product image, and then I will publish it.  
61:26 - Okay, now we have to create the sub products. So 
I'll click Add New, and then I'll put Cosmo robot,  
61:33 - because the robot toys gonna be a cardinal 
robot, we already have the description,  
61:36 - so we don't need to add the description, all we 
have to do is add the price, which will set as  
61:42 - $100. And then what we want to do is make sure 
it's invisible. So right now, this will just  
61:48 - show up on the normal store page. But we want 
to click the Edit for the catalog visibility,  
61:53 - and we'll have it hidden. So we'll only show 
up as the group product. So I'll publish this.  
62:01 - And now I'll create two more. 
So let me just copy this  
62:05 - and add new. So this is gonna 
be a cardinal robot plus case.  
62:15 - And then this is just going to be $150. And 
then we will put the visibility to hidden.  
62:27 - And then I'll just do one final product, which 
will be capital robot plus case plus extra  
62:34 - charger, then this will be $200. And then 
I will, again, change the visibility and  
62:45 - publish. Now that we have all these sub products 
created, let's go back to our main product page.  
62:50 - And I will select the robot toy, the initial 
one and click Edit. Now we'll go down and go to  
62:57 - linked products. And here's where we add all 
the linked products. So we have Cardinal robot,  
63:04 - we have Cardinal robot plus case, and we have 
customer rep plus case was extra charger, no  
63:11 - this update this product. And now we can 
view product to see what it looks like.  
63:18 - Okay, so we have says robot toy. And we can choose 
kasma robot, cosmic robot plus case, or Cardinal  
63:25 - probit plus case was at your charger, and you can 
see it has the price range of all these prices.  
63:30 - And everything else is basically the 
same as the other types of products.  
63:35 - Okay, we're going to learn about one final type 
of product, which is a downloadable product. So  
63:41 - I'm going to New and click on product. So 
a downloadable product could be an ebook,  
63:46 - it could be an image, it could be a zip file full 
of a bunch of different files. And it could be a  
63:54 - song maybe. So we are going to actually 
be selling a song or robot song and  
64:03 - and we just add the description 
just like all other products  
64:10 - Okay, now we can change from, it's gonna be a 
simple product, but we're going to click Virtual  
64:15 - and downloadable. So virtual means that it's not 
going to be shipped to anybody and downloadable  
64:21 - means we can choose what the file is to download. 
So this is going to be a $3 song. And then I can  
64:28 - add the file that's going to be downloaded. So I'm 
gonna go to choose file and then upload the file.  
64:36 - And then I got had this robot song that mp3. And I 
don't know why I added all these extra characters  
64:42 - at the end because that wasn't on my computer, but 
no problem. So now it actually puts the URL right  
64:49 - in here. And then for the file name, I'm going to 
put robot song dot mp3 And then you can choose how  
64:57 - many times a person can download it It's default 
to unlimited, but maybe you only want somebody  
65:02 - to download it three times. And then how long will 
the download link work? So right now, it will work  
65:09 - forever. But we can make the download link expire 
after a certain number of days. Let's give them  
65:15 - one week to download the song. Okay, we'll go up 
here. And this add, I'm going to add make this  
65:21 - and accessory, we could make a new category called 
the songs. And then for tags, we'll just put song  
65:31 - in it Oh, yeah, also, we're going to need 
a picture. So I'm going to set the product  
65:36 - image. Instead of uploading a new image, I'm 
just going to pick one that's already in here.  
65:40 - So this looks like so how about this one, see, 
this person is actually listening to something. So  
65:47 - we'll set that as the product image because 
they're listening to the song right in there.  
65:51 - So now I'm going to publish this  
65:56 - and we'll go to View product. Okay, so if you add 
this to cart and exit, go to the checkout, it will  
66:05 - end up giving you a link to download the song. 
Our store has products. Now it's time to make so  
66:12 - a customer can actually check out by configuring 
payment processing taxes, shipping coupons,  
66:18 - and more. Okay, now we're going to add payments, 
we're going to make it so your store can accept  
66:23 - credit cards. And to do that, we're going to 
add a new plugins, let's go to the plugins here.  
66:30 - The way we're going to make it so customers 
can pay with a credit card is through stripe.  
66:35 - And to do that, we're going to add a new plugin. 
So click Add New. And now I'm going to search  
66:42 - for stripe. And then we have the WooCommerce 
stripe payment gateway. So let's install that.  
66:54 - Okay, then I'll activate. Now let's 
create or login to our Stripe account.  
67:03 - Okay, I'm here@stripe.com. And I'm going to click 
sign in and you click that whether you have an  
67:09 - account yet or not. And then I'm going to you can 
either sign with your account or you can sign up.  
67:16 - If this is your first time claim 
account, you're going to have to verify  
67:20 - a link in your email. The great thing about 
stripe is it's completely free to use.  
67:27 - Now I'll go to payments. And these are all the 
different things you can set as payments. And I'm  
67:33 - going to turn stripe on and then we can connect 
or create a Stripe account to accept payments.  
67:40 - So I'm going to click here connect or create a 
Connect account, we already created the account.  
67:45 - And then it's going to go through this, they just 
want to verify my phone number. So enter my phone  
67:50 - number here. And now we'll connect the account. 
And now we'll just put an information about the  
67:56 - business like address and other things. And then 
you can even put your bank account information so  
68:02 - you can get your payout from stripe. Okay, we 
got done, I got done putting in all the really  
68:08 - personal information to get this Stripe account 
set up and connected. Now we're gonna update what  
68:15 - shows up on your store website when someone's 
paying by stripe. Instead of credit card stripe,  
68:21 - let's just call it credit card. People don't 
necessarily have to know that it's using Stripe.  
68:26 - And luckily the keys from the Stripe account 
automatically got switched over here.  
68:34 - Okay, now we have to we have a few things 
disabled that way to fix. So it says that  
68:38 - the payments payouts is disabled until missing 
business information is updated. I'm gonna go here  
68:46 - Edit Account keys. And we have to add this URL 
to the Stripe account settings. So I'll copy that  
69:00 - endpoint and add the endpoint. We're just going 
to listen for all endpoints, I'll click Add events  
69:11 - and then add endpoint. Now we just have to 
copy this web hook hook secret and go back  
69:18 - to WooCommerce. And I'm just going to paste 
it in right here. And then save live keys.  
69:26 - Okay, we can now accept payments. We can 
accept payments. We can't do payouts yet  
69:33 - until we put in a little information, a 
little more information on the stripe page.  
69:38 - But we can receive the payments. And 
then once we update more information  
69:42 - about like our bank account and stuff 
like that, then we can accept the payouts  
69:47 - so on stripe if you want to test it 
out, you can enable test mode here  
69:51 - and then when you're done testing it make sure 
you turn test mode off and Stripe gives you  
69:56 - some test card numbers. So if I click here gonna 
open up these test card numbers that you can use.  
70:03 - So when you're testing your website, you can use 
these test numbers. They're not real numbers,  
70:08 - but stripe, you can use this to test an order with 
stripe. Okay, let's go back over here, we're going  
70:17 - to set up one more method of payment. So I'm going 
to click payment here. And now I'm going to set up  
70:23 - payment with PayPal. So you can set up any of 
these types of payments, and it will no matter  
70:28 - which one you pick, it's going to walk you through 
that. But for this tutorial, I'm just showing  
70:32 - stripe and PayPal. So I'm going to install another 
plugin. So I'm gonna click on plugins here. And  
70:39 - I'm just going to search for or excellent, click 
Add New. And then I'm going to search for PayPal.  
70:50 - Okay, WooCommerce PayPal payments, install now.  
70:54 - And Activate. Okay, now I can just go to 
WooCommerce, Settings, and then payments. And  
71:06 - then I can come down to where it says PayPal, turn 
that on. And then I'm going to connect to PayPal.  
71:18 - Just like with stripe, I'm going to create a 
PayPal account, or maybe you already have one,  
71:22 - I'm just going to sign into my PayPal account 
that I already have. And you'll have to make  
71:27 - sure it's a PayPal business account. So 
I'm gonna create a new business account,  
71:33 - you're going to set up a PayPal business 
account. But after you do all that,  
71:37 - you can go back to WordPress. And then 
we're going to enable the PayPal gateway.  
71:44 - So you can can't change what is going to look 
like. But most of this you can can just keep  
71:50 - the default settings. The only thing you may 
want to do is decide whether you're going to  
71:57 - use sandbox mode to test it, or you want to 
actually turn it on for real. So we'll leave  
72:04 - sandbox mode off. So we'll have it turned on 
for real. And then I'll just save changes. Okay,  
72:10 - now we have two forms of payments, set up stripe 
for credit cards. And then we also have PayPal,  
72:16 - we're going to test it all out in a 
moment. But first, let's set up the tax.  
72:24 - So to get taxes to work, we have this tax tab 
here. But to make it even easier, we're gonna  
72:31 - we're gonna install another plugin. So 
I'm going to go down to plugins again.  
72:36 - And this time, I'm just gonna go directly to 
add new plugin. And I'm going to search for tax.  
72:46 - And then we're going to look for 
WooCommerce shipping and tax.  
72:50 - So this is going to make it much easier to 
set up both the shipping and tax. That's  
72:55 - the great thing about WordPress is 
that there's plugins for basically  
72:58 - anything to help make different things 
easier. Okay, now I'm going to activate it.  
73:09 - And now it's going to say it's going to 
tell me to install jetpack and connect.  
73:13 - So to make this easy tax system work, you're 
going to have to install jetpack and other thing  
73:19 - and also create a jetpack account. But it's going 
to make things way easier to set than the setup  
73:26 - taxes manually for every state installation 
failed destination folder already exists. This  
73:32 - could mean that it tried to install and 
something messed up in the installation.  
73:37 - And then when it tried to install 
again, the folder was already there.  
73:41 - So to actually to remove that the folder, 
we're actually going to go back to hosting  
73:46 - her and we're going to have to go to our hosting 
account for robot attire. So let me go to manage  
73:56 - and now I'm going to have to go to where we can 
actually to access the actual files that make up  
74:02 - WordPress and be able to find that folder and 
delete. So let me scroll down a little bit here  
74:09 - and I'm going to go to File Manager  
74:16 - now you have to be very careful when you're in 
the file manager because you've messed something  
74:20 - up something here. It can mess up a lot of 
things on your website. I'm going to open this  
74:30 - okay now to find wp content. Now plugins 
and now I'm going to find jetpack  
74:43 - and I'm just going to delete this jetpack 
folder by clicking the Delete button up here.  
74:52 - Okay, now that Jetpack is deleted we 
can go back to our hosting our page and  
74:59 - I'm Just going to refresh this so we 
can try installing jetpack again. So  
75:06 - I'm going to click install now. Okay to 
install, I can just activate this now.  
75:16 - Now I have to set it up. So setup jetpack. Like 
I said, I'm going to have to create an account  
75:26 - I'm just going to create an 
account with my Google login.  
75:36 - And we can choose any of these paid 
plans. But if we scroll down a little bit,  
75:39 - we can just do jet pack free, so we're 
just going to use the free version.  
75:44 - And then you just set the 
some things here and then  
75:48 - make sure to not choose anything that costs money. 
I'm just click dot not now for all these things.  
75:57 - Okay, this is setup, we don't actually 
have to get this this plan here.  
76:01 - So I'm going to go back to WooCommerce 
and back to settings. Now at the tax  
76:12 - Okay, now we have the option 
to enable automated taxes,  
76:18 - this is going to make everything work way easier. 
If you don't have automated taxes, you have to set  
76:23 - up the taxes individually for each state, and each 
place that you're shipping to or shipping from.  
76:30 - But automated taxes, we'll just figure that out 
all on on its own, it will see it says your tax  
76:36 - rate and tags will be automatically configured for 
Michigan United States that's right live, if you  
76:40 - live somewhere else, it will just enable it will 
just automatically figure out the taxes from where  
76:44 - you're shipping from. And where we're enabling 
prices exclusive of tax, so the tax will be added  
76:51 - extra. And then we're going to calculate tax 
baseline customer shipping address most of this,  
76:56 - you're just going to use exactly how it's set. 
So I'm just going to click Save Changes. Okay,  
77:04 - now we can do something similar with 
shipping, I'm gonna go to shipping.  
77:08 - So we're going to create some shipping zones. It 
says right here, shipping zone is a geographic  
77:13 - region where a certain set of shipping methods 
and rates apply. And we're going to add a shipping  
77:18 - zone. And then you're going to choose where the 
zone. So let's make a zipping shipping zone called  
77:24 - United States. And then I'll I'm going to ship 
and I'm going to choose United States. So for the  
77:34 - entire United States, we're going to add certain 
shipping methods. So the first one, so we have a  
77:41 - few options, we have the flat rate free shipping 
or local pickup. So I'm gonna click add shipping  
77:47 - method for a flat rate. Now I can edit this. So 
some places, depending on where you're located,  
77:56 - sometimes shipping will be taxable. And a lot of 
places it's not suddenly click none, but you'll  
78:01 - you're gonna have to look at your area wherever 
you're based off out to see if you should tax  
78:06 - the shipping or not. So I'm going to put a flat 
rate of just about $6. And I'll save the changes.  
78:13 - Now we can add another shipping method. So let's 
say we have free shipping, but we only want free  
78:19 - shipping as someone spends enough money. So I'm 
gonna go to edit. And free shipping requires what  
78:24 - does it require? Well, maybe a shipping coupon, 
we'll talk about coupons in a little bit here,  
78:30 - or maybe a minimum order amount, you can see 
there's different options, I'm gonna do a minimum  
78:34 - order amount, so I'm going to make someone spend 
at least $30 to get free shipping. When do coupons  
78:42 - apply are going to apply minimum order rule before 
the coupon discount or after the coupon discount  
78:47 - Moses to after the coupon discount, and 
then click Save Changes. So now people  
78:53 - have the option of the flat rate or the free 
shipping. So we added this shipping zone,  
78:58 - we're also going to add another shipping zone. So 
I'm gonna click shipping zone here. And then we  
79:03 - have United States. But let's say we want to ship 
to another country, like maybe we want to ship to  
79:11 - Canada. So the shipping is gonna cost a little 
more since I'm based in the United States.  
79:17 - And I'll do all of Canada. And here we're 
gonna do a flat rate and it's going to be  
79:26 - this time $10 It's a little more because we have 
to ship it a little further. And then I can go  
79:32 - back to shipping zone. And then you can see you 
can also do local pickup if you want to add your  
79:37 - specific city or state and then you can choose 
local pickup. Okay, let's look at some of these  
79:44 - options here. So you can choose whether you want 
to hide the shipping cost until an address entered  
79:50 - or just depending on what you want to look like to 
the customer. Now Shipping Classes allows you to  
79:58 - create different shipping costs for different 
types of products. So maybe some products,  
80:04 - you'll be charging $5 for shipping, some 
products, you'll be charging $10 for shipping,  
80:11 - I'm not going to show you this in this tutorial, 
but you can add different Shipping Classes,  
80:15 - and then set your products to to go with that 
shipping class. And then that product will, will  
80:22 - be charged that shipping rate. But let's go 
to this next step here WooCommerce shipping.  
80:30 - And this is because we have the plugin installed, 
we have the WooCommerce shipping plugin,  
80:35 - and it allows us to automatically print shipping 
labels, and save a trip to the post office. So  
80:41 - you can choose some settings like where how are 
you going to print the labels. And then if you  
80:47 - want to be able to purchase shipping labels 
right through here. And so I'm just going  
80:52 - to leave this all as it is. Okay, now we're 
going to learn about creating coupon codes,  
80:58 - it's actually pretty simple. So on the 
WooCommerce area here, I'm gonna click on coupons.  
81:05 - It's telling us actually, on this new version, the 
coupon management has moved. So let's remove the  
81:09 - legacy coupon menu. So we'll just be using the new 
coupon menu, which is now in marketing coupons.  
81:17 - And all this, you can either click on 
Create Your First coupon or just add coupon,  
81:21 - I'll click on Add coupon because it's the method 
that you're going to be using the most. And  
81:25 - then we can just create the coupon code. And I'm 
going to create the code rope robots are amazing.  
81:34 - This description is really just for you. And 
I'll put robot coupon. And then there's a few  
81:40 - different types of coupons you can make, you can 
make a percentage discount, so everything's going  
81:45 - to be 10% off a fixed cart discount. So you get $5 
off your order, or a fixed product discount, which  
81:52 - is a discount that only applies to one specific 
product. So what I'm going to do is create a  
81:58 - percentage discount. So we can put 10%. And then 
you can choose whether you want to always allow  
82:07 - free shipping, or maybe maybe not. So the 
coupon can include free shipping, or it cannot  
82:12 - and then you can choose when it expires. 
So let's say it expires here a week later.  
82:17 - And then we can go over to usage restrictions. So 
how much do they have to spend to be able to use  
82:23 - the coupon? So let's say they have to spend $20 
To use the coupon. And what's the maximum number,  
82:30 - you may have no maximum. But maybe you don't want 
them to be able to use a coupon on an order that's  
82:35 - over $500. And then you can choose whether the 
coupon can be used with other coupons or not,  
82:41 - whether it should exclude sale items. And 
then here is where you would choose if a  
82:46 - coupon applied only to a specific product. Or if a 
product would be excluded from a coupon. You know,  
82:54 - there's some things that never go on sale like 
have you ever seen a Nintendo Switch on sale?  
82:57 - Well, they would have that excluded. And then 
you can apply the coupon only specific categories  
83:03 - exclude categories. And then if you only want 
certain email addresses to be able to use it.  
83:08 - So only certain people can use the coupon, you can 
put it here. And then we have the usage limit. So  
83:14 - how many times can this coupon be used? Well, 
after 500 times a coupon can no longer be used  
83:19 - anymore. So how many here is how many items you 
can use it for. So how many how full your cart  
83:27 - can be. And then how many times can each user 
use a coupon, we'll just put one time, that  
83:32 - makes sense. Each user can only use the coupon 
one time, obviously, someone could just create a  
83:36 - new account and use it again. But that limits it 
somewhat. And I'm going to publish this coupon.  
83:45 - Okay, at this point, we're gonna test all this, 
I'm gonna go to the store and purchase something  
83:52 - and use this coupon. So let me go to the store, 
visit Store or visit site or visit store,  
83:58 - go to products, and x, I already have two things 
in my cart from before, oh, an item which is no  
84:05 - longer available as you move from your cart. Well, 
I'll remove this too. So I can do the whole thing  
84:09 - from the beginning. So let me go to the shop. 
And I am going to get a hat. So I just add,  
84:17 - I just could click Add cart. And then here you 
can add to the khaki to select the options first.  
84:22 - So I'm going to get a small shirt. That's 
the color red. And I will add this to cart.  
84:32 - And so we have this options here where you can 
pay without even going to the cart. Actually,  
84:38 - let's turn that off. Because we want someone to 
actually have to go to the cart before they pay.  
84:46 - Okay, I'm on WooCommerce setting them on 
payments. And I'm going to go down to where  
84:51 - it says Pay Pal. I'm going to manage that 
and then I'm going to scroll down where it  
84:59 - says sync little product page. And then I'm 
going to disable enable on single product.  
85:05 - So now it's not going to show up on the product 
page will still show up on the cart though,  
85:10 - and I'm going to save changes. And one more 
thing I'm going to do and we go back to the  
85:14 - Payments tab, and then I'm going to 
go to the stripe payment settings.  
85:19 - And we are going to disable this Express 
checkouts, so it's not going to show these Express  
85:27 - Checkout buttons. Okay, now let's go back to our 
product page. Can I'll just refresh the cart page,  
85:34 - and you can see those buttons are gone. So I'll 
add a medium of a small red shirt, add to cart.  
85:43 - Okay, now I'm going to view the cart. Okay, 
these two cards, I thought he added a hat.  
85:48 - Let me go back and add a hat really quick. 
And add to cart. Okay, now view the cart.  
85:56 - Okay, so now I have two shirts and the hat. 
Now I'm going to a plot apply coupon. So  
86:02 - robots are amazing. Apply the coupon. Okay, now 
you can see that we've got an A $9 discount. And  
86:13 - I can choose between Fred flat rate or 
free shipping. Good, because remember,  
86:17 - we set free shipping, as long as the amount is 
over $50. It's sewing that shipping to Michigan.  
86:25 - And then I'll proceed to checkout. 
Okay, now I can put in some of my  
86:29 - information here. Then I'm going to put 
in a demo credit card number from stripe.  
86:35 - And then he I don't think the numbers here 
matter when I'm using the demo. Oh, yeah,  
86:41 - it could be in in test mode to test the 
cart. So let me go back over to this menu.  
86:47 - I'm going to quickly go to Manage stripe, and then 
enable test mode. Okay, let me save that. And then  
86:57 - I have to when I'm in test mode, you have to have 
special test keys. So good edit account keys. Oh,  
87:02 - see, there's the live keys and there's the 
test keys. So let me get the publishable key  
87:12 - and then the test secret key. And 
then the test secret web hook.  
87:24 - So we're setting this up, just like before.  
87:30 - And I'm gonna add endpoint. And 
then I just need to copy this ID  
87:36 - put it in here and save test keys. Okay, I'm 
going to refresh the page, put in the billing  
87:43 - information. And then I'll put in this test credit 
card information. And then place order. And thank  
87:52 - you your order has been received. Now let's 
go look at our administrator email account.  
87:59 - So here's the administrator email account. 
So we get an email when we receive an order,  
88:04 - and it's showing new order, you've received 
an order from Beau Carnes and it has all the  
88:09 - information it has the shipping address. Now 
let's go to our administrator dashboard. Now  
88:15 - if we go to orders here, we can see the order 
it says order from Beau Carnes is processing.  
88:23 - So three items are rage fulfilled, I could create 
the shipping labels in the product and go from  
88:28 - processing to completed. And then I'm going to 
update that. And then in this Customers tab,  
88:35 - we can now see the customer would There's a new 
customer. And then we can go to the Reports tab,  
88:41 - showing how much we've how much money we've 
made. And then the Orders tab, we still have  
88:46 - that order in there. Finally, we are going to talk 
about the emails that get sent to the customers.  
88:53 - So I'm gonna go to Settings, and then emails. So 
here you can check the emails that get sent for  
88:59 - various reasons. So we already have the emails 
go to the administrator email for New Order,  
89:05 - cancelled order failed order. But then an email 
would get sent to customers for all these other  
89:11 - things such as a completed order processing 
order. And if you click on Manage, you can  
89:17 - choose what the email is going to look like you 
can enable or disable the email notification,  
89:23 - you can change the subject email heading 
additional content, so you can choose what  
89:28 - email that you the customer is going to get. And 
one thing to notice if I go back to the email tab  
89:34 - here, it has this message here. So in case if you 
get this all set up and the email does not arrive  
89:41 - to the customer, you're gonna have to look at this 
here to ensure your stores notifications arrive  
89:46 - in your and your customers inboxes we recommend 
connecting your email address to your domain  
89:51 - and setting up a dedicated SMTP server. Something 
doesn't seem to be saying correctly install the WP  
89:57 - mail logging plugin so It could just 
work out of the box. But if it doesn't,  
90:03 - I would recommend installing this plugin. And 
it's pretty straightforward. I'm not going to  
90:08 - show in this tutorial, but I will just take 
you step by step into getting it working.  
90:11 - And then that will make it more likely 
that your email will get to your customer.  
90:16 - Okay, we're almost done, there is one more loose 
end I want to cover, which is this top bar here  
90:21 - where it has don't miss our holiday off for 20% 
off, well, we probably don't want that because  
90:25 - it may not be a holiday. So I'm gonna go to 
Customize. And then I'm gonna go to header.  
90:32 - And here's the top row. So if you remember, 
there was the social icons on the right side,  
90:38 - and then we have the message on this side. So I'm 
going to click here. And now here we can change  
90:44 - what message is in this top row here. 
So maybe instead of the the holiday,  
90:51 - instead of talking about the holiday 
offer, we can say check out our new hats.  
91:01 - And then you can actually make this a link 
and you can link it to your hat page. So  
91:09 - I'm just gonna whoops, publish this.  
91:15 - Another thing I could do is just remove this 
completely. So if I just exon socials, and exon  
91:23 - top row, or exon, this HTML thing, and I publish 
it. Now if I go to my website, I'll just exit out  
91:30 - of this. Now we don't even have that row at the 
top. So you may just not even want that top bar.  
91:37 - The store is complete. You now know how to set up 
a fully functioning e commerce website. There are  
91:43 - a ton of settings and plugins that we didn't even 
get to. So feel free to just explore the different  
91:49 - options and see how you can customize your store 
even more. Good luck with selling your products.
