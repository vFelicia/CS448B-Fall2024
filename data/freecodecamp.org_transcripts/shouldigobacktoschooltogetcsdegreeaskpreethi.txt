00:00 - hey it's prey again and I'm back with
00:03 - the ask prey series and this is week
00:05 - number two um this week's question is a
00:08 - very interesting one and one that I
00:09 - actually get pretty commonly and so
00:11 - let's go ahead and read it he says I've
00:14 - been teaching myself to Cod for almost a
00:16 - year now I initially started from free
00:17 - code camp and other tutorials the more I
00:20 - learn about web Technologies like
00:21 - JavaScript the more I want to learn
00:22 - lower level languages like C++ a part of
00:25 - me wants to go back to college to study
00:27 - computer science I've done a little bit
00:29 - of research Arch and many seem to say
00:31 - that it's not necessary but I want to be
00:32 - marketable for a career in software
00:34 - development I have read that the
00:36 - industry is being flooded with jior
00:37 - developers that don't know enough to be
00:39 - productive so I suppose that is why I
00:41 - think I need to go back to school I had
00:43 - been applying to companies that fit my
00:45 - skill set and I haven't had received one
00:47 - response regarding an interview I'd
00:49 - really appreciate your advice on whether
00:51 - I should bite the bullet and go back to
00:52 - college or just keep getting better at
00:55 - JavaScript and web Technologies like
00:56 - react and angular this is actually a
00:59 - very common question I get and actually
01:01 - one that I also had when I was getting
01:04 - started with programming and I'll kind
01:06 - of start off by saying that there's
01:07 - really no Silver Bullet answer per se
01:10 - because it really just depends on you
01:12 - and honestly your circumstances your
01:14 - timing obviously and all that and what
01:16 - you can afford um but I can show you
01:19 - kind of my decision process for how I
01:21 - thought through this decision of whether
01:22 - I should go back to college if I want to
01:24 - become a
01:25 - programmer and I kind of outlined my
01:28 - decision process in my blog post on why
01:30 - I left the best job in the world so if
01:32 - you want a more detailed explanation of
01:34 - how I thought through this you can read
01:35 - that blog post um but let's just get
01:38 - started so I felt that for me I was
01:41 - already in a full-time job right and so
01:43 - for me I felt like if there's any way to
01:45 - learn to to for me to learn the skills
01:47 - of becoming a programmer without going
01:49 - back to college I was 100% for it um and
01:53 - the reason is because for one it's way
01:56 - cheaper right um like if I go back to
01:58 - college the tuition for college is what
02:00 - like anywhere between 10 20 40K a year
02:04 - and um I already had paid off I I
02:07 - already had a fouryear degree so I paid
02:10 - off already like $90,000 in student
02:12 - loans and I was like H I really don't
02:14 - want to take take out loans to go to
02:16 - college again and secondly it's it's I
02:20 - wanted a faster path um when I want
02:22 - something I really really want something
02:23 - and I want it right away and I didn't
02:25 - really have the patience to wait 2 3 4
02:28 - years to get a degree and then become a
02:30 - programmer um I wanted the fastest path
02:33 - and and the most efficient path to get
02:35 - there and so before I made the decision
02:38 - what I did was I reached out to a ton of
02:40 - people and did a lot of research on this
02:42 - right so first I met with a bunch of
02:44 - people who went the traditional path and
02:46 - they had a CS degree and I kind of
02:48 - talked to them and talked to them about
02:50 - how they got to um what their first job
02:52 - was like how they how they made that
02:53 - transition from school to getting their
02:55 - first job and so forth and then I met a
02:58 - bunch of people who were more the the
02:59 - non-traditional path who were either
03:01 - self-taught went to a boot camp or both
03:04 - and um and I kind of talked to them
03:06 - about their process for how they kind of
03:08 - broke in to become become a software
03:10 - engineer and at the end of this whole
03:12 - research process what I realized was yes
03:15 - there's a lot of people who take the to
03:17 - take the traditional path of getting a
03:19 - computer science degree but there's also
03:21 - hundreds or thousands of people who are
03:22 - totally totally killing it without a
03:25 - degree um top of my mind some examples
03:28 - of people who I really look up to who
03:30 - fit in this bucket are like Dan abob
03:32 - who's the creator of Redux or P Irish
03:35 - who now works at Google or my really
03:37 - good friend has kesi who was a poker
03:38 - player turn and software engineer just
03:40 - like countless examples that I saw in
03:42 - the industry and what's common amongst
03:45 - all these different people were that
03:47 - they were passionate they were
03:48 - determined and they were smart and at
03:50 - that and they just wanted this really
03:52 - badly and they figured out a way to do
03:53 - this without the degree so I was like
03:57 - okay if these people can do it I can do
03:58 - it too right and and um I think when
04:02 - you're kind of making this this decision
04:04 - it's important to just be honest with
04:05 - yourself and so when I look back and
04:07 - think through why I think I might have
04:10 - been successful without the degree is
04:12 - you know there there's a few different
04:13 - reasons I can think of one is that um I
04:16 - kind of already had a technical
04:17 - background so in college I was a systems
04:20 - engineer and I you know because of that
04:23 - I took a lot of pretty heavy high high
04:25 - level math and Engineering courses so I
04:28 - already like I was already kind of
04:30 - trained to think very analytically I was
04:32 - very good with math and very good with
04:33 - numbers but that's not to say that you
04:36 - need a technical degree to be a
04:37 - developer I think I know plenty of
04:39 - people who studied like philosophy or
04:41 - psychology in college and then later on
04:43 - in life realized they want to be
04:44 - developers but for me like I think that
04:46 - was one of the reasons why I was pretty
04:48 - successful in this
04:49 - transition and um second I was obviously
04:53 - extremely passionate about it and and I
04:55 - kind of conveyed this passion throughout
04:57 - various blog posts I've written and I
04:59 - just wanted this so badly and I think
05:01 - because I wanted it so badly I was
05:03 - incredibly determined I I worked really
05:05 - hard and I put I put a lot a lot of time
05:07 - and effort into making this reality
05:09 - happen um and you know along the way I
05:12 - did have to give up and sacrifice a lot
05:14 - like for example I didn't see my family
05:16 - for almost a year during the process I
05:18 - didn't see a lot of my friends for many
05:20 - many months um I was pretty much doing
05:22 - this day out day in and day out just
05:24 - learning how to code every single day
05:26 - getting a little bit better at it and um
05:29 - even you know even my boyfriend I didn't
05:31 - see for like you know I saw him once a
05:32 - week which is like really really hard
05:34 - obviously but um you kind of I was kind
05:37 - of willing to give up these things
05:39 - because I knew that I wanted this dream
05:41 - to come true so badly um and I think uh
05:46 - this might motivate some people so early
05:48 - on in my decision process I was talking
05:51 - to a really good Mentor and you know he
05:53 - was he's this kind of um highly academic
05:57 - person who has a CS degree and he has as
05:59 - a PhD in computer science um you know
06:02 - went to Stanford so very academic and I
06:05 - was kind of telling him about my
06:07 - decision to go become a software
06:09 - developer and I was kind of saying like
06:11 - hey like I don't know like one thing I'm
06:13 - worried about is how will I ever catch
06:15 - up with these people who've been
06:16 - programming since they were 12 years old
06:18 - they literally have like a decade of
06:20 - experience over me and maybe even a
06:22 - college degree and what he said he
06:25 - looked at me in the eye and he's like
06:26 - what I see in you is grit and passion um
06:29 - you're going to get there in no time
06:30 - just just go for it and when someone
06:33 - like that said that to me someone who's
06:35 - academic and has a degree and he just
06:36 - like he's like no you can do it without
06:38 - it like just go figure it out it's all
06:40 - about just doing and that that really
06:42 - was inspiring to me and I was like okay
06:44 - I can do this without the
06:46 - degree um and kind of to address his
06:49 - question of you know the industry is
06:51 - being flooded with Junior developers
06:53 - that don't know enough to be productive
06:55 - I totally um I've heard this too uh
06:58 - there's definitely a lot of people who
06:59 - are trying to get into the industry more
07:01 - than ever now and you know everyone kind
07:03 - of wants to be software developers it
07:05 - seems and sure there's probably a lot of
07:08 - developers out there who are simply not
07:09 - ready for full-time jobs and maybe
07:12 - they're getting hired but they're not
07:13 - being
07:14 - productive and but you know like as I
07:18 - said there's plenty of examples to show
07:20 - out there of people who are totally
07:21 - killing it in the industry without a
07:23 - degree um the main thing to understand
07:26 - though is that it's not easy it just
07:27 - takes a lot of hard work and there's
07:29 - really just no shortcuts not getting a
07:31 - degree doesn't mean that you take a
07:32 - shortcut it simply means that you work
07:34 - really really really extra extra hard to
07:37 - kind of make up for that lack of degree
07:39 - right you can't just expect to maybe
07:41 - take a course online or attend a three
07:43 - Monon Boot Camp or take like you know
07:46 - like an online boot camp like Udacity or
07:48 - something and then all of a sudden
07:49 - magically have a job um you can do all
07:52 - those things but that's just one part of
07:54 - the process and in addition to that you
07:56 - have to put hours and hours of practice
07:58 - and work and and really just make up for
08:01 - that time that you didn't spend in
08:02 - school getting a degree and so um to not
08:06 - be one of those people who are you know
08:07 - not being productive in the industry you
08:09 - just need to go above and beyond and
08:12 - every person I know who's successful in
08:14 - the industry um that doesn't have a
08:16 - degree they're successful because
08:18 - they've put these hours and dedicated
08:20 - their lives to making this reality come
08:22 - true um so again if you're willing to
08:24 - put the hard work then you honestly just
08:26 - won't be one of these developers who's
08:28 - not productive I
08:30 - have never met someone who's worked that
08:31 - hard and and and like didn't get better
08:34 - over time or wasn't the one of the
08:36 - better per best programmers I've ever
08:38 - met right um and even if it takes you
08:40 - longer to get there than than some
08:42 - others just don't compare yourself to
08:44 - other people it's just about putting in
08:46 - the hours putting in the time practicing
08:48 - coding um getting projects on your under
08:50 - your bell like you know it's frustrating
08:53 - like the first few months are very
08:54 - frustrating just keep trying keep trying
08:57 - and over time like you'll look you'll
08:58 - look up and you you're like oh my God I
09:00 - just know so much how did I get how did
09:02 - I even get here right and I think um if
09:06 - I had to go back and think one of the
09:08 - hardest part about not taking this path
09:11 - of not getting a degree is probably
09:13 - getting your first interviews and
09:14 - getting your first job because you don't
09:16 - have you don't have any experience you
09:18 - don't have anything to show that you you
09:20 - can code basically and so um what I
09:24 - would do like as I as I said in my last
09:26 - video if you don't have something like
09:28 - if you don't have a degree if you don't
09:29 - have experience don't focus on what you
09:31 - don't have show them everything else
09:33 - that you do got so this can be this can
09:35 - be like um this can be like side
09:37 - projects or this can be like internships
09:40 - or this can be like open source work
09:41 - that you've done or blog posts that
09:43 - you've written um just make up for that
09:46 - lack of degree in other ways right and
09:49 - um another thing I want to empathize is
09:51 - if you choose to not get a degree one
09:53 - thing that happened to me was I noticed
09:54 - that like I was starting to I I really
09:56 - wanted to fill in my gaps of some of the
09:58 - formal fundamental CS stuff like things
10:01 - like computer networking operating
10:02 - systems compilers algorithms and data
10:05 - structures design patterns like these
10:07 - are things I still wanted to learn
10:09 - because I think those are very very
10:10 - important too if you're going to be a
10:11 - serious software engineer these are all
10:13 - important things to learn and so what I
10:15 - did was I would learn these things on
10:17 - the side um on weekends or nights just
10:20 - like picking up a few books and um just
10:22 - like learning learning them on my own
10:24 - because I I really want to fill in those
10:26 - gaps that I didn't get um through formal
10:28 - training
10:30 - and I actually have met with a few
10:32 - companies now that are actually um
10:35 - specifically targeting people who don't
10:37 - have CS degrees but are software
10:38 - engineers and they're teaching more of
10:40 - these CS fundamentals like I met at a
10:42 - school called Bradfield School of
10:43 - computer science in San Francisco and
10:46 - they teach things like you know computer
10:47 - networking computer architecture
10:49 - databases compilers so you know like
10:51 - find something like this to fill in the
10:52 - gaps if you don't get that formal
10:54 - training instead if you take more of a
10:56 - um online course or boot camp approach
10:59 - and lastly um the the writer who wrote
11:03 - in said he wants to be a C++ developer
11:05 - without a CS degree um or he's asking if
11:08 - you should get a CS degree to be a C++
11:10 - developer obviously I can't answer that
11:12 - question because I've never tried that
11:14 - myself um uh I was a JavaScript
11:17 - developer and I also did some API work
11:19 - and backin work like I slowly moved down
11:21 - the stack um but my gut tells me it's
11:24 - definitely possible perhaps there's less
11:26 - C++ content and a lot more content to
11:29 - learn learn online with JavaScript Ruby
11:30 - or python but um I think anything in
11:34 - anything in the world is possible
11:35 - without a degree so if you if you're
11:37 - confident that you can do it um I don't
11:39 - think you I I'm never going to say that
11:41 - you must get a degree to do anything
11:43 - because I just don't believe that um but
11:46 - I do want to say that just because I
11:48 - didn't go back to get a CS degree it
11:50 - doesn't by any means mean that I think a
11:52 - CS degree is a waste of time in fact if
11:55 - I was in high school and I knew what I
11:56 - known now about computer science I'd
11:58 - probably do the computer science degree
12:00 - over the systems engineering degree that
12:03 - I did but you know like no regrets at
12:05 - the time when I was in you know 18 I
12:08 - really fell in love with systems
12:09 - engineering I loved my major um so I
12:12 - have no regrets it's just that I learned
12:13 - about computer science a little bit
12:14 - later in life so um I didn't have a
12:17 - chance to take CS in college but I think
12:18 - a CS degree if you're still in high
12:20 - school is obviously incredibly valuable
12:22 - and you should totally do it if you're
12:24 - in high school um but it's not game over
12:27 - if you haven't if if it's too late um
12:29 - there's always ways to to learn how to
12:31 - be a developer like I did and many
12:33 - others have done so um I want to close
12:36 - off by saying if you want to be a
12:37 - developer um you just need to start
12:39 - doing um you just need to start building
12:41 - because being a developer is not about
12:43 - sitting in a classroom or taking exams
12:46 - or taking tests or getting certificates
12:47 - or getting a degree it's really about
12:49 - just building software and if you can
12:51 - prove to people that you can build
12:52 - software the degree is just a tiny part
12:55 - of it and that will soon be Irrelevant
12:58 - in in the future
12:59 - and um and as I said there's just been
13:02 - thousands of people who've been
13:03 - successful without the degree and it
13:04 - really just depends on how much effort
13:06 - work and hard work you're willing to put
13:08 - into this so um yeah that's kind of my
13:12 - rationale for why I didn't take that
13:13 - path but um I hope you found this
13:16 - helpful and I'll see you in next week's
13:20 - video
