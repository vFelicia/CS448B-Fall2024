00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to css3 in
00:02 - 30 days today is day number 20 and we
00:04 - are gonna be making
00:06 - some random animated pyramid let me show
00:09 - you what's going on here so i needed an
00:12 - idea for a project to make
00:15 - and i was starting to run out of
00:16 - inspiration and i thought
00:18 - what can we make that's
00:20 - interesting possibly practical and
00:23 - exercises some css3 chops
00:27 - and
00:28 - the best i could come up with in this
00:30 - particular moment was an animated
00:32 - triangle
00:33 - so
00:34 - here it is
00:37 - on your journey to css3 mastery spend at
00:40 - least 20 minutes learning how to code a
00:43 - triangle
00:44 - okay so let me show you before before
00:47 - you skip this video and go do something
00:50 - better with your time
00:52 - um
00:53 - we have a little triangle here and when
00:54 - you hover over the triangle watch what
00:55 - happens it's a lot more interesting than
00:57 - what you see on the screen so far here
00:59 - we go
01:00 - so check it out when you hover over this
01:03 - triangle
01:04 - it creates a bigger triangle with two
01:06 - other layers and then text appears and
01:08 - the colors change
01:10 - so it's actually kind of interesting and
01:12 - it's super easy to make and it is
01:14 - practical so it did check off all the
01:16 - boxes
01:17 - uh and the way i might think of how you
01:20 - might display this is
01:21 - if you were
01:23 - if you had a piece of text or maybe you
01:25 - offered a service let's say you're a web
01:27 - designer and you you're building a
01:29 - portfolio website and you wanted to
01:30 - display
01:32 - the services you offer this could say
01:34 - you know i'm hiding the text so this
01:35 - could say services and then when you
01:37 - hover over services it splits down and
01:39 - shows the services that you create they
01:40 - could be images as well
01:42 - if you wanted to display maybe like um
01:45 - you know different layers of a project
01:47 - if you had like the final final project
01:49 - in like the top part of the triangle and
01:51 - then like the wireframes and then you
01:54 - know then the sketch below i don't know
01:55 - just coming up with random ideas here
01:57 - but
01:58 - maybe you have some thoughts on how you
01:59 - might use this and it's simply three
02:02 - elements that that when you hover over
02:03 - them they just animate down and appear
02:05 - the interesting thing that's happening
02:06 - here is that they're actually these
02:08 - elements are actually three rectangles
02:12 - and i'm not using borders to create a
02:14 - triangle like we did in a previous
02:16 - lesson just a couple days ago
02:18 - i'm actually
02:20 - clipping the entire element so this
02:22 - whole thing is wrapped in an element
02:24 - called triangle and triangle is clipped
02:28 - to a custom
02:30 - shape that i created of the triangle now
02:32 - let me show you in the code editor what
02:33 - is going on so you know what i'm talking
02:35 - about
02:37 - so go ahead and download 20 animated
02:39 - pyramid and
02:40 - fire it up in your code editor and let's
02:42 - get started here in index i'm going to
02:45 - show you the markup looks simply like
02:46 - this
02:47 - dave with the class of triangle wrapping
02:49 - three individual divs with the class of
02:50 - top mid and bottom and then text within
02:53 - each of the divs
02:54 - that's it now what we're going to do in
02:56 - our sandbox is simply style those up
02:59 - clip it and
03:01 - transition it it's really quite simple
03:03 - so let's just get started here in the
03:05 - sandbox
03:06 - we're going to get started and we're
03:07 - just going to
03:08 - style up the triangle triangle is going
03:10 - to have a position of relative
03:12 - height of
03:14 - 320 pixels that is the total height of
03:17 - of the triangle when it's done
03:21 - and
03:22 - uh and i'm going to leave the clip path
03:23 - for now
03:24 - we're going to start with just
03:25 - rectangles and we'll do the shape after
03:27 - so you know what's going on triangle
03:29 - and then div so we're selecting the divs
03:31 - within the triangle and those are the
03:33 - three individual divs background red
03:37 - width 100
03:39 - height 100 pixels we'll start with the
03:41 - bare bones here we're going to go margin
03:44 - zero auto and color white for the text
03:49 - uh just so you can see everything let's
03:51 - give them a little space just so you can
03:52 - see uh margin zero auto and then 10
03:54 - pixels on the bottom just for now so you
03:56 - can see there we go we have three
03:58 - three red triangles now this shape is
04:01 - not only a rectangle but can sometimes
04:04 - be
04:05 - a triangle
04:07 - let's uh tighten up the text a little
04:08 - bit we're gonna say
04:10 - line height 100
04:12 - line height 100 pixels so it's
04:15 - vertically centered text align center
04:17 - font size 0.8 m
04:21 - if we save that refresh it so now we
04:23 - have top mid and bottom so
04:25 - we have the three rectangles let me show
04:27 - you what happens when i mask
04:29 - the entire element
04:31 - with a clip path so now watch this is
04:34 - where the magic comes in
04:35 - so we're going to say up in triangle
04:37 - clip
04:39 - path
04:41 - we're going to do polygon and here's how
04:43 - it works we did have a lesson on
04:45 - creating custom shapes so if you want to
04:47 - unders if you forgot how this works go
04:49 - back to that lesson
04:51 - creating custom shapes using clip path
04:53 - uh and then you'll understand how these
04:56 - coordinates work but let's start here so
04:58 - we're going to have three
05:00 - comma separated
05:02 - couples of values so let me let me show
05:05 - you how this works so we have 50
05:07 - and zero
05:09 - so if i leave it at that let's see what
05:10 - happens
05:12 - you can't see anything because we need
05:13 - other coordinates so comma
05:16 - separate the next two values 20 percent
05:18 - and 100 percent
05:20 - save that and see what happens
05:22 - still can't see anything okay and now
05:26 - we're gonna do one more eighty percent
05:28 - and one hundred percent
05:30 - save that let's see what happens now
05:33 - there's your triangle the end result
05:35 - of the shape you see how it's masked so
05:38 - you can only see what's within this
05:39 - window now if i change these values you
05:42 - can customize the shape so if i said
05:43 - like fifty percent there
05:45 - it looks like this
05:47 - uh you know ten percent
05:49 - it's actually got a longer left side so
05:51 - if i were to say zero this might help
05:53 - you understand
05:55 - so that's the zero percent
05:57 - mark
05:58 - on the x axis
06:01 - yes
06:02 - and then if i move that over twenty
06:04 - percent
06:05 - it's actually going in 20 percent
06:07 - and then 100 let me change that to like
06:10 - 80 percent
06:12 - it's actually now it's on the y axis so
06:15 - on the vertical axis the y axis if i'm
06:18 - if i'm not mistaken
06:19 - and so now it's 80 down from the top but
06:22 - if i want it 100 down from the top it's
06:24 - going to give me that perfect shape
06:26 - you can have it any shape you really
06:28 - want you can make it really wonky
06:30 - looking
06:32 - shape like that if you want it's kind of
06:34 - neat
06:34 - but i'm just going for a perfect
06:36 - triangle which is 50
06:38 - in from the top left
06:40 - and zero so it's staying on the zero
06:43 - uh up here that on the y axis
06:46 - and then you got 20 in and then you got
06:48 - 100 down and then 80 in and 100 down
06:51 - creates the triangle
06:53 - beauty love it now
06:55 - let's
06:56 - hide those two the mid and bottom
06:59 - uh shapes rectangles you can call them
07:02 - polygons and hide them up at the top and
07:04 - then show them on hover
07:07 - so now what we're going to do
07:09 - is we're going to position
07:13 - absolute
07:14 - the triangle div we're going to say top
07:17 - 0 we're also going to hide the text so
07:19 - the color of the text is going to be red
07:21 - and we're going to remove that margin
07:23 - auto 10 it's just going to be margin 0
07:25 - auto so there we go save that now you
07:28 - can only see that triangle so now we're
07:29 - in the right place but when we hover
07:31 - nothing happens because we're not
07:32 - telling it to do anything
07:34 - so
07:35 - what we're going to do now is we're
07:36 - going to say down here
07:38 - triangle
07:41 - hover so on hover of the triangle not
07:43 - the triange the word triangle is
07:46 - versatile and can also be pronounced
07:49 - triang
07:52 - div
07:53 - color white so all the colors of all the
07:55 - divs are gonna be white and now
07:58 - all the the mid and the bottom are gonna
08:00 - be separate positions so so all we need
08:02 - to do is move
08:04 - the position of the of those elements
08:07 - separately i don't wanna have them both
08:08 - be like you know
08:10 - top
08:12 - 100 pixels because what's going to
08:14 - happen
08:15 - is they're all just going to move down
08:17 - to there it's it's really really weird
08:20 - so
08:21 - we only want the middle and the bottom
08:23 - ones to move so now we're going to say
08:25 - triangle
08:29 - hover
08:30 - and then
08:31 - the class of mid so we're selecting mid
08:33 - we're going to move it down see if i
08:35 - move it 100 pixels let's see what
08:36 - happens and let's change the background
08:38 - while we're happening over here to green
08:40 - so let's see what happens
08:42 - so you see mid
08:44 - and still the top but it's actually the
08:46 - bottom one is hiding up there because
08:48 - the zed index so
08:50 - we're actually going to fix this really
08:52 - quickly
08:52 - so the reason why i'm what i'm going to
08:54 - do now is bottom is is is here
08:58 - we can see it within this clip path and
09:00 - mid is actually working there's no gap
09:01 - there we'll fix that but i want to fix
09:03 - the z index of the top so
09:07 - let's actually go here
09:09 - uh
09:10 - before the hovers so we're gonna say
09:12 - just top
09:14 - zindex one that should just put it in
09:16 - the front of everything so top is the
09:18 - one that you always see so that when it
09:19 - animates
09:21 - the top is always in the front when the
09:23 - other ones slide out behind it rather
09:24 - than the other one sliding out in front
09:25 - of it which would look just a little off
09:29 - okay and now let's see where was i let's
09:32 - go
09:33 - back to our triangle hover
09:37 - mid and move it down 110 pixels because
09:39 - i want that gap in between them
09:41 - like that cool
09:44 - okay
09:45 - and now the uh the other thing we need
09:47 - to do is i'm going to copy this and i'm
09:48 - going to paste it change it to
09:51 - bottom
09:53 - now we need to move it down 220 pixels
09:56 - because we're going down another 100
09:57 - pixels change the color to blue
10:00 - save that refresh
10:03 - hover now your triangle appears but it
10:05 - doesn't look very exciting because it's
10:08 - just appearing and that's not actually
10:10 - doesn't have any meaning to the
10:12 - to the you know the functionality and
10:14 - it's just weird it's quite off-putting
10:17 - so all we have to do now
10:19 - is actually
10:20 - under the triangle div
10:24 - style
10:25 - say transition so it's not a true
10:27 - animation it's actually just a
10:28 - transition we're going to transition all
10:31 - of the things that can be transitioned
10:32 - so position color
10:35 - background
10:37 - you know
10:37 - height anything that we change will
10:40 - transition with an ease at 0.6 seconds
10:44 - save that refresh now try
10:47 - so
10:48 - there we go
10:50 - that looks looks good
10:54 - and that's it now let me just show you
10:56 - actually why i did this top z index
10:59 - i'm gonna take that out and show you
11:01 - when i hover now without that you see
11:03 - how they're
11:04 - the color these ones are coming from the
11:06 - top they're coming from in front of the
11:08 - element
11:09 - if i did it really slow like six seconds
11:11 - you'd see it
11:12 - watch see how it's bottom and mid
11:15 - they're coming out from in front of top
11:17 - i don't actually want that i want it to
11:19 - slide out from
11:20 - see
11:21 - i want it to slide out
11:23 - from behind
11:25 - so by having that z index
11:28 - and let's do
11:29 - the six seconds again it looks more like
11:31 - this
11:32 - they slide out from an under
11:34 - like that
11:36 - that's a bit more of what i want
11:39 - and maybe what i want to do is actually
11:40 - give mid as that index in front of
11:43 - bottom so it doesn't so bottom doesn't
11:44 - slide out in front of mid okay so let's
11:47 - say mid
11:49 - we'll just go like this
11:51 - mid
11:53 - it gets a z index of one and top gets a
11:56 - zed index of two
11:58 - save that
11:59 - now watch
12:02 - there we go
12:03 - now bottom slides behind mid mid slides
12:06 - behind top that's exactly what we're
12:07 - looking for let's go back to our 0.6
12:09 - second transition
12:11 - now try it
12:12 - that looks clean
12:14 - there we go
12:15 - and that's it that's uh that's it for
12:18 - today's
12:19 - animated pyramid project now
12:22 - the way you might use this is totally up
12:25 - to you
12:26 - depending on your project on your
12:27 - website maybe it's a portfolio thing and
12:29 - you're displaying information there's
12:31 - lots of interesting things you could do
12:32 - you can use different shapes you don't
12:34 - have to use a triangle you can use a
12:36 - circle you can have more elements that
12:38 - slide out
12:39 - there's lots of different ideas that you
12:41 - can do so
12:43 - maybe that gave you some ideas maybe
12:44 - that kind of
12:45 - made you think of a few different things
12:48 - either way you got to spend
12:50 - 10 or 15 minutes with me making an
12:52 - animated triangle so hope you're having
12:54 - a great day and i'll see you tomorrow in
12:56 - day number 21.
