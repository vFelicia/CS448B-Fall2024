00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to css3 in
00:01 - 30 days today is day number 22 we're
00:03 - gonna be playing around with some
00:04 - flexbox now back in day 9 we used CSS to
00:09 - create some modern layouts essentially
00:10 - what we're gonna do today is create
00:12 - those exact same modern layouts but
00:15 - instead of using floats and clears and
00:16 - margins and math we're going to be using
00:18 - flexbox and I'm going to show you how
00:20 - incredibly easy it is to create layouts
00:22 - with flexbox now bear in mind flexbox is
00:25 - a relatively new technology and not
00:28 - fully supported totally across the board
00:30 - but it's pretty darn good and you can
00:33 - use your discretion on where you want to
00:34 - use it of course can I use com is a
00:36 - great website to see which properties
00:37 - and values those combinations which of
00:40 - those are more widely supported so you
00:42 - can use your own discretion and you can
00:44 - always use fallbacks as well other thing
00:47 - I want to let you know is flexbox is a
00:50 - large area of study it's not just a
00:53 - quick little property or a quick little
00:55 - style there's actually a lot to it and I
00:57 - don't want to cover the massive amount
00:59 - of Theory involved in flexbox I'm gonna
01:02 - give you a really great resource in fact
01:03 - it's actually my favorite coding blog is
01:07 - CSS - tricks by Chris Koya and he has
01:11 - got the complete guide to flexbox and
01:14 - i've referred to this on numerous
01:16 - occasions when making my own flexbox
01:19 - layouts and websites so and as you could
01:21 - see it's last updated on November 12th
01:23 - which at the time of this recording was
01:24 - only about 15 days ago so he's always
01:28 - updating this and I love love this
01:31 - article that he's put to put together
01:33 - this guide it gives you the background
01:35 - on flexbox and the basics and
01:38 - terminology and all the properties and
01:41 - everything that you would ever need to
01:44 - know about flexbox
01:45 - it's really great and a great practice
01:47 - so part of my homework for this lesson
01:50 - would be - whether you want to do it
01:52 - before or after we make some layouts is
01:54 - head over to CSS - tricks comm slash
01:58 - snippets slash you know what I'm just
01:59 - going to put the link up on the screen
02:01 - here and you know just Google CSS tricks
02:04 - a flexbox as well that will get you
02:06 - there I'll put it up on the screen
02:07 - whatever you need to do to get there
02:09 - so check that out credit to Chris coiour
02:12 - for that
02:13 - so let's get back to it what is flex box
02:14 - flex box is essentially relatively new
02:17 - technology since 2009 and onward there's
02:19 - been multiple iterations of flex box but
02:22 - basically it's an easy way to create
02:24 - layouts so that you don't have to use
02:26 - floats and clears and and all that sort
02:29 - of stuff it makes creating layouts and
02:32 - sidebars and organization of content
02:35 - incredibly easy incredibly streamlined
02:37 - naturally responsive of course you can
02:40 - modify it and customize it in whatever
02:41 - way you wish and when you see how easy
02:45 - it is to create some simple and modern
02:48 - layouts you're gonna wonder why you
02:50 - didn't use flexbox before now before you
02:53 - just jump on the flex box training
02:54 - remember you need to do your homework
02:56 - and your due diligence to make sure
02:58 - you're not creating a production-ready
02:59 - client site that's only based on certain
03:02 - flex box properties that may not be
03:04 - cross browser compatible so do your
03:06 - homework let's jump in and show you what
03:09 - we got so day number 22 flex box layouts
03:11 - the same layout organization as the day
03:15 - number nine for modern layouts and down
03:17 - in the final result you can see the
03:19 - layout so we got header article a side
03:21 - footer basic layout content and sidebar
03:23 - number two got the logo and the cut in
03:26 - the navigation and a header with two
03:28 - sidebars an article in the middle
03:31 - flexbox layout number three essentially
03:34 - the same header here but the logos on
03:35 - the right we got three equally sized
03:38 - articles in a three column grid and
03:39 - within a main content and then a footer
03:42 - so that's really it
03:43 - and let's jump in to our code editor see
03:47 - what we got
03:48 - day number twenty two flex box layouts
03:50 - go ahead and download that come back to
03:53 - this and let's get started in here we
03:55 - got some basic markup we've got the
03:57 - sandbox is what we're gonna be playing
03:58 - around with and each layout is within a
04:02 - section tag with the class of layout one
04:05 - two and three respectively
04:06 - we have headers a main content with
04:09 - articles and asides footers it's very
04:11 - semantic straightforward simple html5
04:13 - and of course final about CSS is there
04:16 - for your reference to help you out if
04:19 - you have any issues of course keep in
04:21 - mind that every class for the final
04:24 - result is prepended with fine
04:26 - underscore whereas we're just going to
04:28 - be using the classes called layout one
04:30 - two and three and the reason why I do
04:32 - that is so that those styles don't
04:34 - conflict so that the final homework the
04:36 - final result doesn't conflict with the
04:38 - sandbox so let's jump in now keep in
04:42 - mind this isn't gonna be a theory lesson
04:44 - so if you've never heard of fly flexbox
04:47 - before certain piece of parts of this
04:49 - might be a little over your head so
04:50 - giving you a fair warning right now I'll
04:53 - do my best to explain certain things but
04:55 - I do recommend you read that Chris
04:57 - coiour guide on flexbox should take you
05:00 - about 15 20 minutes or so just so you
05:02 - can understand what's going on when we
05:04 - start playing around some properties
05:05 - you've maybe never heard of before
05:06 - layout one main we're selecting the main
05:10 - tag within layout one we're gonna tell
05:12 - it display flex so instead of like
05:14 - inline or block we're gonna say flex and
05:17 - that's gonna tell everything within the
05:19 - main content in that main tag - to be
05:24 - aware that this is a flex item this flex
05:27 - container and the Flex Direction is
05:30 - going to allow us to tell tell the
05:35 - browser how to display the the direction
05:38 - of the content so in bootstrap we'll use
05:40 - things like div with the class of row
05:42 - well in Flex box we just simply use flex
05:45 - direction and we can say row so we don't
05:48 - actually have to like create another tag
05:50 - in HTML to do essentially just this so
05:54 - we're gonna tell it that the main
05:55 - content container is actually gonna be a
05:58 - row it's going to contain a row and you
06:00 - can also do things like row reverse to
06:02 - reverse the the order of the elements so
06:05 - if you have one two three you can
06:06 - actually save over verse and it will
06:07 - actually go three two one so I might
06:09 - show you an example that after so that's
06:12 - it we have to do for that nothing's
06:13 - going to happen yet so we're gonna say
06:15 - layout 1 and then article so in this
06:18 - element we have an article and an aside
06:21 - now to make that article fit a certain
06:24 - amount 3/4 ish of the width and the
06:28 - sidebar be on the side with a smaller
06:30 - amount of width all we're gonna do is
06:33 - say flex and this is a shorthand
06:34 - property
06:35 - I believe it's flex grow shrink and
06:38 - basis
06:39 - kind of like when you write border and
06:40 - it has you know solid one pixel read as
06:43 - a shorthand for three different
06:44 - properties so I'm just gonna say flex
06:47 - one now what this says is any articles
06:52 - within the layout element the layout
06:55 - class have them all take up the exact
06:57 - same amount of space so you that's gonna
07:00 - make a lot of sense when we get to the
07:01 - layout number three when we've got three
07:02 - identically sized articles if I were to
07:05 - say flex one or say flex two the article
07:08 - will try to take up twice as much space
07:10 - as the other elements within the Flex
07:12 - container so but this one is just going
07:14 - to take up the same amount of space as
07:15 - every other article or element that is
07:20 - within that content so let me just show
07:23 - you if I just say flex one let's see
07:25 - what happens so you can see that it just
07:28 - automatically created to 50% width
07:30 - elements not because I said 50% but
07:33 - because I said flex one the article will
07:35 - take article will take up the same
07:36 - amount of space as the other elements
07:38 - within that container now if I say flex
07:41 - two it's not going to do anything
07:43 - because because the other element the
07:47 - aside doesn't actually have a flex
07:50 - property styled on top of it so if we
07:52 - just went down here and said layout one
07:55 - aside and then said flex one and then
08:00 - save that you can see now that the
08:03 - article is twice the size as these side
08:06 - now you might be wondering okay but
08:08 - those are really fixed sizes what if I
08:10 - don't want to just always be with two
08:12 - times the width or three times the width
08:13 - or what if I want to fine-tune that well
08:16 - you actually can do that quite easily so
08:19 - I'm going to remove a side here and just
08:21 - style the article I'm gonna say flex one
08:23 - as a basis and I'm gonna say 58 percent
08:26 - now this is essentially this value is
08:29 - going to tell it the width the maximum
08:33 - width and that's not technically maximum
08:35 - width but it's the space that you want
08:37 - it to take up so you can kind of
08:40 - override that one-to-one ratio and then
08:42 - refresh now it's taking 58% of the width
08:45 - of that container now what I find
08:46 - interesting is if I were to change this
08:48 - to 50% it's going to go to its regular
08:51 - 50%
08:52 - but if I were to go to 100% it's not
08:55 - going to actually fill it out 100%
08:57 - because flexbox knows that there's still
08:59 - a container there so it's not gonna push
09:01 - it down it still needs to fit within
09:02 - there so it's this is roughly I don't
09:05 - really know it looks like it's around
09:07 - 75% so I'm not really entirely sure of
09:10 - the reason why it does that but it's
09:12 - kind of smart so I'm gonna go back to my
09:14 - 58% with space there and now the problem
09:19 - is these are jammed up against one
09:21 - another so I want a little bit of space
09:22 - so all I'm gonna say here is just a
09:25 - margin right 2% and that will give it
09:29 - some space and it doesn't make the aside
09:33 - tag fall down or anything like that it
09:35 - just automatically distributes the width
09:38 - so that both of these elements can live
09:39 - happily ever after within its flex
09:42 - parent now if I were to say flex
09:45 - Direction row reverse it's going to
09:47 - reverse these as you can see now the
09:49 - aside is on the left and the articles on
09:51 - the right despite the way I've coded the
09:52 - markup which is really neat this would
09:54 - take a lot more to style in CSS and
09:58 - would be a there's a little bit of
09:59 - hackery going on there if if I was
10:01 - trying to do that and just floats and
10:03 - clears and so on and so forth so rower
10:06 - verse is a nice value for flex direction
10:09 - but I'm gonna put it back to here and
10:11 - that's it for the first layout that's
10:13 - all we had to do now if I had to do this
10:15 - in just floats and clears I'm hard to do
10:17 - math and I would have had things
10:18 - collapsing and it would have been a
10:19 - little bit stressful and confusing now
10:21 - that's not to diminish how much was
10:23 - going on here there's a lot going on
10:25 - with the shorthand property I encourage
10:27 - you to read about it and test it and
10:29 - play around with it but you could see
10:31 - how exciting this is when creating
10:34 - layouts so let's jump into layout number
10:36 - two and we're gonna say layout two
10:39 - header we're gonna say display Flex of
10:42 - course flex direction this is something
10:45 - that you're gonna often be writing these
10:47 - two things row and then within there
10:51 - we're gonna say layout - header and then
10:54 - nav so we're selecting something more
10:56 - specific we're gonna say flex one save
10:59 - that and let's see what happens so far
11:00 - so you can see now that they're both
11:02 - jammed up kind of it's what's happening
11:05 - is that flex box is only
11:06 - taking the calculating the Wits bathe
11:08 - based on the content within the
11:11 - container itself for the most part it's
11:13 - kind of like an inline block so to speak
11:15 - that's why we have to use additional
11:17 - properties to space them out and tell
11:19 - flexbox how much space we want
11:21 - distributed between the elements so I'm
11:24 - gonna go down here and say layout -
11:26 - header nav and I'm gonna say flex one
11:30 - oops flex and then one and so that
11:35 - changes it to take up the entire amount
11:38 - of its its space that's available for it
11:41 - as you can see it just did it filled out
11:44 - almost like 100% of its available space
11:47 - and I'm gonna say margin left to give it
11:50 - some space I'm gonna do 2% again and
11:52 - that'll give it space so just like that
11:54 - I've created that simple layout like
11:56 - that now I want to move down to the main
11:59 - element so layout to main so I'm
12:02 - selecting that main tag and I'm gonna
12:05 - say display flex flex direction of
12:09 - course and you guessed it row and now
12:13 - I'm gonna say layout to article so now
12:17 - I'm selecting the article within there
12:18 - now keep in mind there are also two
12:20 - asides on either side of the element I'm
12:23 - gonna say flex and one now if I just did
12:28 - that let's see what happens now
12:29 - everything here very interesting what's
12:33 - going on here let me just take the Flex
12:35 - one out of there and let's see what
12:37 - happens now that I told it to be a flex
12:41 - element the main container here the side
12:44 - on the left is this size the article on
12:47 - the middle is this size so a bit bigger
12:49 - quite a bit bigger and then the article
12:51 - on the right side the aside on the right
12:53 - side is quite a bit smaller because
12:56 - there's less content so all this is
12:57 - being intelligently calculated as best
13:00 - as it possibly can by flexbox to try and
13:02 - automatically size the elements based on
13:05 - it just being a flex element but I want
13:08 - to override that and tell it to be
13:09 - specific so I'm gonna say flex for the
13:11 - article I'm gonna say one I'll see what
13:13 - that does nothing good because based on
13:17 - the other two flex
13:20 - it starts making things wonky which is
13:22 - why we want to start adding some
13:23 - percentages here so I'm gonna say 56%
13:28 - and that's going to give it 56% of its
13:31 - available of the available space for it
13:34 - now the problem here is these asides are
13:38 - throwing off this element here I don't
13:40 - want it to be like this so let me just
13:42 - first give it some margin so I'm gonna
13:44 - say margin
13:45 - let's go zero and 2% on the left and
13:48 - right okay so the space on the bottom
13:52 - here I don't really want that so I'm not
13:54 - gonna write a shorthand I'm gonna say
13:55 - margin left 2% margin right 2% that
14:00 - should keep it there we go
14:01 - the other nice thing about flexbox is do
14:03 - you notice how these elements are
14:05 - maintaining the same height as the
14:07 - article how the aside despite this only
14:11 - having this much content is still this
14:14 - long which is as long as the article
14:16 - which is as long as the other aside and
14:18 - that's the other cool thing so if you
14:19 - wanted a background like on these
14:20 - elements that to maintain the same
14:23 - height as the the growing content it's
14:26 - very easily and automatically done
14:28 - without you having to do anything in
14:29 - flexbox so that's cool so let's move on
14:32 - down to fix those asides because I don't
14:35 - like how they look layout to a side side
14:39 - nav and the sidebar now if I just say
14:46 - flex one so they fit their available
14:50 - space let's see what that does
14:52 - so now things are looking weird because
14:54 - now I have these looking way too small
14:56 - but I can override that and say 20
14:59 - percent so each of those are going to
15:00 - fit about the 20% of its available
15:02 - content just like that now they are
15:04 - identical widths with space in between
15:07 - the article and just like that I've
15:09 - coated up this beautiful three column
15:13 - multi width layout just using a couple a
15:17 - couple of selectors here so that's
15:19 - really cool now let's move down to
15:20 - layout number three now we're gonna say
15:23 - is we're gonna say layout three header
15:27 - that's gonna be display flex again of
15:30 - course and then flex direction
15:33 - rrrow reverse is what we're gonna do
15:36 - play around with it a little bit now
15:38 - let's say lay out three header and we're
15:42 - going to select that nav we're gonna
15:43 - tell it to be flex of one and let's see
15:49 - what that does and you can see that the
15:52 - logo is on the right because we said row
15:54 - reverse if I just said row that logos on
15:58 - the on the left side but I want on the
15:59 - right I don't change the mark up at all
16:01 - the order of the mark up I'm just using
16:03 - flexbox to tell it where to go I want a
16:06 - little bit of space however let's say
16:08 - margin right from that nav to percents
16:13 - keep everything within the same
16:14 - percentage convention okay and now let's
16:17 - play with those articles are going to
16:19 - say layout three and the class of
16:23 - articles which is the wrapper around the
16:26 - three articles there's a div with the
16:28 - class of articles and I'm gonna say
16:30 - display flex and then flex direction row
16:35 - then we're going to say layout three
16:38 - article we're selecting each individual
16:40 - article like this flex one save that and
16:44 - now each of these three articles have
16:46 - the exact same they take the exact same
16:48 - amount of space because they are the
16:50 - same element and they have a flex of one
16:53 - but I want some space between them so
16:56 - I'm going to say margin zero and two
16:58 - percent on the left and right now they
17:00 - all have margin zero two percent on the
17:02 - left and right problem is I don't want
17:04 - that on the first element on the left
17:06 - side and I don't want it on the last
17:07 - element on the right side it's a little
17:10 - bit of simple CSS trickery here css3
17:14 - trickery rather layout 3 article first
17:19 - child and article last child simply
17:25 - gonna say margin zero
17:28 - I want no margin on those specific
17:30 - styles elements and there it is right
17:33 - there
17:33 - now it's equally distributed with some
17:35 - 2% margin in between I love it okay so
17:40 - now let's just do some simple responsive
17:43 - like a simple responsive fallback
17:45 - because right now everything's just
17:47 - going
17:47 - flex hence flexbox and will always
17:50 - retain that layout problem with that is
17:54 - that doesn't look good so all we're
17:57 - gonna do here is have some simple fall
18:01 - backs here let's say responsive fall
18:04 - back and we're gonna say media screen
18:07 - and max width 768 pixels pretty standard
18:13 - width for while phones are getting so
18:16 - large now that that's probably the
18:18 - tiniest iPhones portrait but really that
18:21 - is the landscape of iPhones and similar
18:24 - sized
18:25 - devices it's not based on the physical
18:27 - size of the device it's based on the the
18:30 - pixel size and the pixel ratio within
18:32 - that because we have Retina screens and
18:35 - everything and gets confusing when
18:36 - responsive media queries first came out
18:39 - and screens were very simple this it was
18:42 - quite easy but responsive media queries
18:45 - have started to get a little bit more
18:45 - complicated with the rise of high
18:48 - resolution screens anyway I digress
18:50 - let's make these things vertically stack
18:53 - when you get to 768 max width so we're
18:57 - simply just going to select all of the
19:00 - main the article let's put this all in
19:03 - one line article aside header and we
19:10 - also have logo we have side nav I'm just
19:16 - taking all the styles all the elements
19:18 - that we styled and sidebar and we also
19:23 - have articles woops
19:26 - that is all of the elements that we've
19:29 - used those are all the elements we've
19:31 - used and we're going to say
19:32 - display:block so no longer flex
19:36 - float:none width 100% margin zero zero
19:41 - two percent on the bottom so everything
