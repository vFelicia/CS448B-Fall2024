00:00 - hello everyone
00:02 - so super nervous super excited though to
00:04 - present
00:05 - on recording presentations using obs and
00:08 - youtube it's a cool way to put yourself
00:11 - on youtube it's cool way to educate
00:13 - others and uh kind of gonna do that now
00:15 - to show
00:16 - everyone from start to finish to install
00:18 - to youtube how to do obs
00:21 - and uh take that recording and put it on
00:23 - youtube
00:27 - i'm getting ahead of myself
00:29 - that's for later
00:31 - go ahead and exit out of that
00:32 - so i have instructions actually on how
00:34 - to get started i want to go over some
00:36 - system requirements for
00:38 - obs this is obs setup and settings
00:41 - and so obs is available on windows mac
00:44 - and linux it's amazing it's on all three
00:47 - it works well in all three
00:49 - it does require directx 10 compatible
00:52 - integrated graphics and so it's a it's a
00:54 - more modern
00:55 - cpu type thing
00:57 - and so like that basically is like intel
00:59 - i5 2000 series or higher it uses open
01:03 - gpl on linux
01:05 - and so i had an old laptop i actually
01:07 - couldn't use because uh it was a core 2
01:09 - duo laptop and it's just too old and so
01:13 - it's almost kind of it's not really a i
01:15 - use it for open source development so
01:17 - i'll still use it but uh this laptop
01:19 - does obs quite well
01:22 - new like a little
01:23 - joe system recommendations
01:25 - it's hard to find hard specific
01:27 - requirements for obs online but
01:29 - basically news better than old kind of a
01:31 - given
01:32 - gaming or business laptop is generally
01:34 - better because of the heatsinks than
01:35 - ultrabook and so this is an ultrabook so
01:38 - if i were to play you know battlefield 1
01:40 - and do obs at the same time this one's
01:42 - going to be screaming just it's like
01:44 - as it tries to cool it down which is
01:46 - really kind of distracting for the
01:47 - microphone
01:49 - so if you have a gaming laptop or
01:50 - business laptops better but for what i'm
01:51 - doing it's going to be fine
01:53 - because i'm just doing a presentation
01:55 - and so mo ram mo better and so i got a
01:58 - little picture of a ram there if you can
01:59 - see it
02:01 - it is optimized for windows and so if
02:04 - you're on windows you're in luck
02:06 - there's a lot of streamers online a lot
02:08 - of people recording content online that
02:09 - are on windows
02:11 - and you get quite a bit less cpu usage
02:13 - on windows and linux is getting better
02:16 - every day and
02:17 - it's developed for all of them
02:19 - so pre-setup you want to change your
02:21 - resolution in 1920x1080
02:23 - or
02:24 - 1280x720 basically the hd resolutions
02:28 - and the reason i say that i'm currently
02:29 - on 720. this is a 4k
02:32 - monitor on this laptop and for obs to
02:34 - have to scale from 4 4k
02:37 - to
02:37 - 1080 or 720 on the fly is a little bit
02:40 - too intensive for it and so um the the
02:43 - cpu unless you're on a gaming laptop or
02:46 - a business laptop that has a you know
02:48 - like a good heat sink then um it's it's
02:51 - going to struggle a little bit so i like
02:53 - 720 because if you're doing a
02:55 - presentation if you're if you're showing
02:56 - windows like i'm going to be showing you
02:58 - they're going to be easier to see
03:00 - so the first thing we need to do is
03:01 - download obs we're going to do this live
03:03 - guys
03:04 - uh done done done
03:06 - click on windows
03:08 - um
03:09 - and so here's this is a 64-bit installer
03:11 - which is what you want to do most of the
03:13 - time here's 32-bit we're going to do the
03:15 - 64.
03:17 - it's going to download it oh
03:20 - that's not too bad
03:22 - but i'm going to cancel on my cheat
03:24 - i already have obs
03:26 - downloaded
03:27 - should
03:28 - right there
03:30 - yes
03:33 - all right
03:37 - so a missing component so what those
03:38 - components are talking about real quick
03:42 - is it once you have the visual studio c
03:44 - c plus plus library included
03:47 - and so if you don't already have that
03:48 - installed i uninstalled it before the
03:50 - presentation then it will trigger that
03:52 - message
03:54 - um so let's go ahead and install them so
03:56 - that should be pretty quick
03:59 - oh did that work
04:02 - oh yeah so i need to click here
04:05 - there we go that's a lot faster it's
04:07 - much smaller
04:10 - open that bad boy up
04:14 - if you've already been using obs this
04:15 - might sound a little bit uh
04:17 - too involved but i do want to have
04:19 - basically a presentation that covers the
04:21 - whole aspect of it so set up successful
04:24 - all right
04:26 - and so i'm to i think i'm going to run
04:28 - the exe again
04:31 - there we go
04:33 - i agree
04:34 - we're going to install it to program
04:35 - files obs studio
04:37 - um
04:38 - browser source that's a good one to have
04:42 - all right let's just go and install it
04:44 - so basically it's next next next
04:51 - all right we're going to launch obs
04:53 - studio
04:57 - okay and we're in
04:58 - oh
05:00 - i kept all my settings okay hold on give
05:02 - me one second
05:04 - and i'm going to actually
05:06 - go to projects joe
05:09 - uh app data roaming i'm gonna actually
05:11 - start completely fresh here
05:14 - for the benefit of learning
05:17 - it's gonna take one second so quit out
05:19 - of obs uh delete my this isn't joe app
05:22 - data roaming uh my name is joe by the
05:25 - way
05:26 - i think we covered that all right and so
05:28 - open up obs studio again
05:32 - all right now we're starting fresh and
05:34 - so here's a license agreement
05:37 - saying it has the
05:38 - gnu
05:39 - general public license which is a very
05:41 - good thing i'll go over that a little
05:42 - later that means it's open source anyone
05:44 - can uh contribute to it
05:47 - all right
05:48 - and then it pops up would you like to
05:50 - run the auto configuration wizard yes i
05:52 - would
05:53 - um
05:54 - it's kind of a sanity check hit yes
05:56 - and so it says optimize for streaming
05:58 - recording and secondary that's a if you
06:00 - are going to be streaming that's a good
06:02 - way to do that if you do do this option
06:03 - see if i go next
06:06 - next again yeah it's going to want you
06:08 - to enter your stream key you can change
06:10 - your streaming service here
06:12 - we're not going to go into that
06:13 - we're just going to do optimize for
06:15 - recording i will not be streaming you
06:17 - can always run the wizard again
06:19 - all right and so the base canvas
06:21 - resolution if i was on 1080p
06:23 - i'd want to select 1080p from here
06:26 - since i am on 720p
06:29 - then i want to use 720 as my canvas the
06:31 - canvas is basically where you're going
06:32 - to put all of your
06:34 - webcam and
06:36 - twitter information for example
06:38 - so frames per second i go with 30. 30 is
06:41 - plenty for a demonstration 30 is plenty
06:43 - for twitch if you want to stream to
06:44 - twitch 60 is kind of a little extreme it
06:48 - requires a lot more processing also
06:49 - requires a lot more bandwidth if you're
06:51 - streaming i do 30.
06:54 - hit next apply settings and we're almost
06:56 - good to go
06:58 - so
07:00 - we did we installed visual studio um
07:03 - basically obs redirected us to their
07:05 - site we downloaded the file we installed
07:07 - it we restarted the installation that
07:09 - worked all right one thing i do want to
07:10 - point out is uh
07:12 - so
07:13 - once you start working with obs you may
07:16 - notice things are not working correctly
07:18 - this is a quick
07:20 - uh this is a quick kind of like gotcha
07:23 - if you have nvidia graphics on your card
07:25 - you might need to check your settings
07:27 - and we're going to go through that real
07:28 - quick so i'm going to hit the windows
07:29 - key do control panel
07:32 - i'm going to go to hardware and sound
07:35 - and then nvidia control panel
07:38 - and so
07:40 - once this pops up
07:42 - it's going to allow me to go over to
07:43 - program settings over here
07:46 - and it should automatically pull it up
07:47 - since i'm using it yep
07:49 - and so where the open broadcaster
07:52 - software is open
07:53 - and sometimes it's set to a high
07:56 - performance nvidia processor we want to
07:58 - make sure it's on integrated graphics
07:59 - and that's all you got to do
08:01 - it was already set to integrated
08:02 - graphics i'll go ahead and apply
08:04 - i don't know if that's going to mess
08:05 - anything up all right we're good
08:08 - and that'll make sure everything runs
08:09 - smoothly
08:12 - all right
08:13 - so let's see what's next
08:15 - we did the auto configuration wizard by
08:17 - the way to get back to that you just go
08:18 - to tools
08:19 - auto configuration wizard you can set up
08:21 - streaming later
08:24 - they do have auto configuration wizard
08:26 - and thankfully they do because obs
08:27 - settings can get intense very intense
08:30 - all right so we set the canvas we set 30
08:33 - frames per second we need to set the
08:34 - record path i do recommend that
08:37 - to do that you go to file
08:39 - settings
08:40 - and we go down to uh
08:42 - outputs
08:43 - and then we do recording path
08:45 - and it's set to joe or c users joe
08:48 - videos that's a good spot so i'm going
08:50 - to leave it
08:51 - but it's good to do that
08:53 - just make sure the videos are going to
08:54 - where you expect
08:56 - hello hello
08:58 - just getting started we basically
09:00 - installed obs at this point and uh
09:04 - doing very basic settings
09:07 - all right and so let's add a background
09:09 - i add a background just so you have a
09:11 - good contrast and so here we have a
09:13 - scene the default scene name is scene
09:15 - and we want to start adding sources so i
09:17 - need to resize this so we can see it
09:19 - better
09:20 - all right and so uh here are the sources
09:22 - we want to add a new source
09:24 - and that new source is going to be image
09:28 - let's go and name it oh
09:29 - let's go it's good to name things so
09:31 - we're going to name this background
09:34 - and that way the source has a name that
09:36 - makes sense i'm going to browse for
09:38 - background go to obs
09:40 - i have this cool little circuit board
09:42 - background
09:43 - i'm going to click ok
09:45 - and oh you can see that
09:48 - it's not scaled well and so the simple
09:50 - way to get that because this is a 1080p
09:52 - image or grader i think is you can
09:54 - actually just move it like that a little
09:56 - laborious
09:58 - but uh that's what i'm basically going
10:00 - to do right there
10:01 - and so that's the new background
10:04 - all right and so we want to add a webcam
10:06 - get into the juicy juice
10:08 - and so this is what the advantage of obs
10:10 - over over over other screen recording
10:12 - software you actually do the webcam
10:15 - it's going to do video capture device
10:18 - and we're going to call this internal
10:19 - webcam
10:23 - awesome
10:26 - there we go hello
10:29 - how'd it do
10:30 - add that in there that's huge i'm going
10:32 - to scale it down and do it the same way
10:34 - i did that
10:35 - pop it over here
10:37 - and bam
10:38 - uh this works in a pinch i don't
10:40 - recommend it i do recommend getting a
10:43 - dedicated webcam that's what this is
10:45 - here i don't know if i can show it here
10:47 - i might show it better but there you go
10:51 - i can do this all in
10:52 - so this is a uh
10:56 - so this is a logitech uh webcam i don't
10:59 - remember the model number but basically
11:00 - it's like a transformer
11:02 - you can like unfold it
11:05 - turn it around and it has like a little
11:07 - hook here
11:08 - it's kind of like the playstation camera
11:10 - if you've ever seen those
11:13 - and then it just basically hooks onto
11:14 - the monitor
11:16 - like that i'm going to cover the
11:17 - existing webcam because we're no longer
11:18 - going to use it
11:20 - what i really like about these is kind
11:21 - of all in one streaming
11:23 - booster and the main advantage
11:27 - for me
11:28 - is that it puts the microphone
11:31 - further away from the fan on the
11:32 - computer further away from the keyboard
11:34 - on the computer
11:35 - and it makes it makes for clearer audio
11:38 - the picture
11:39 - i think is a little bit better
11:44 - but it depends on your computer but if
11:45 - you have an older computer it definitely
11:47 - can help
11:48 - plug it in
11:50 - and so i've already plugged it in but
11:52 - windows would normally be like
11:53 - installing drivers and once that's done
11:55 - we're gonna remove this webcam
11:59 - and that and the webcam disappeared just
12:01 - because i put the other webcam on top of
12:02 - it so
12:03 - we're gonna do a video capture device
12:05 - again we're gonna call this a logitech
12:07 - webcam
12:10 - there we go
12:13 - bam it bam there i am adjust the camera
12:16 - a bit
12:21 - my handsome double
12:23 - all right click ok
12:26 - and this looks kind of boring
12:27 - honestly the square has been done
12:30 - square has been done
12:32 - and so i'm going to guess this is a 4x3
12:34 - ratio and we're going to create our
12:35 - first mask guys obs is all about masks
12:40 - and so i think that's the next step
12:42 - create and add a mask so here's better
12:44 - use better to use a dedicated webcam i
12:46 - might
12:47 - let's let's make a mask
12:49 - and so i'm just going to jump right into
12:51 - it it's kind of hard to explain but
12:53 - masking is basically setting up an image
12:56 - to allow you to crop another image to
12:58 - almost any shape and so we're going to
12:59 - go straight to paint
13:01 - you better use photoshop krita
13:03 - anything like that over paint but i love
13:06 - paint you know goes back to the windows
13:08 - 95
13:10 - or was it 98 i don't remember
13:12 - all right so let's go and resize it
13:16 - i'm going to do pixels
13:18 - i'm going to do 640 by 480
13:21 - oh
13:23 - oh yeah maintain aspect ratio let's get
13:24 - out of there get out of there
13:26 - 640
13:28 - or 480.
13:30 - all right and then i'm going to click
13:33 - back on maintain aspect ratio nope
13:35 - god i had to click ok
13:39 - live demonstration
13:41 - click ok
13:43 - i recommend going bigger
13:45 - and the reason so now set back to
13:47 - percent i'm going to go 200 percent
13:49 - make it bigger that's because the pixels
13:51 - are going to be sharper here in a second
13:52 - let me make it a lot smaller by going
13:55 - down to the zoom over here
13:57 - all right and so we're going to do
13:58 - something cute
13:59 - we're going to do a little uh played
14:02 - around with this i really like paint
14:03 - because you have these free shapes here
14:05 - say free everything should be free but
14:08 - so here we got this shape
14:10 - and i am going to set it to solid fill
14:14 - outline no outline we don't want to
14:16 - outline and then we're going to take uh
14:18 - the shape
14:20 - we're going to drag it it should be
14:21 - white yeah it's white
14:22 - and then
14:24 - i'm just going to go ahead and fill the
14:25 - screen with it
14:29 - okay
14:31 - and make sure it's centered
14:33 - i also want to make sure it's kind of a
14:35 - circle
14:37 - okay
14:39 - good enough definition of done right
14:41 - there
14:43 - to save as it's going to be a png
14:47 - spoil alert
14:49 - another mask up there
14:51 - all right
14:52 - so png and we're going to call it oh
14:56 - bubble mask obvious
15:00 - no what is that what is this thought
15:01 - bubble
15:02 - be more specific thought bubble
15:06 - i'm in the weeds let's get out of the
15:08 - weeds all right save
15:10 - okay
15:12 - and so uh got the logitech webcam here
15:15 - uh and we want to apply that mask and so
15:17 - what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna right
15:18 - click on this
15:19 - i'm gonna go to filters
15:21 - and uh and add us at these resolutions
15:23 - you're fighting with obs a little bit on
15:25 - what the windows are doing so i'm going
15:27 - to move this down
15:28 - you'll see me do this a lot
15:30 - so that gives me access to edit filters
15:32 - i'm going to add a filter
15:34 - and we want to do image mask blend
15:37 - we're going to call this thought bubble
15:39 - just so we know what it is
15:42 - okay
15:44 - we're there
15:46 - all right we want to select the path of
15:48 - the mask browse i already have it set up
15:50 - it's in this obs folder right here that
15:52 - i set up
15:53 - click it and bada bing bada boom webcam
15:56 - is a thought bubble now
15:58 - all right
15:59 - so
16:01 - uh
16:02 - also it's pretty good right now
16:04 - i wanted to show you a little trick
16:06 - and this i think i did mark this down so
16:08 - you can uh crop and pad
16:10 - which is another filter you can apply to
16:12 - zoom the webcam image so when you do a
16:14 - webcam sometimes it'll appear far away
16:16 - especially on ones built into the
16:17 - computer so we're going to do that right
16:19 - now we're going to crop pad
16:21 - pretty easy i'm gonna call this zoom
16:23 - instead of crop pad so we know what it's
16:24 - doing
16:26 - all right and this is just simply
16:28 - adding numbers to all of them and so i'm
16:30 - gonna do 15 15 15 15.
16:34 - oh no we got some clipping up here
16:36 - that's not great so the more numbers you
16:38 - do the more it zooms so all we have to
16:39 - do is move zoom above this
16:41 - and then we have a perfectly zoomed uh
16:43 - webcam image oh it doesn't look like we
16:45 - need zoom we're gonna get rid of it
16:48 - close that
16:49 - all right
16:50 - and so i'm a big fan of uh making sure
16:53 - contrasts are great uh the contrast
16:55 - around the rim is not very good we're
16:57 - gonna make a border and we're gonna make
16:58 - a border using the same mask we just
17:00 - used
17:01 - uh so we're gonna add an image
17:04 - we're going to call this a
17:07 - webcam border
17:11 - and this is kind of a hacky way to do it
17:12 - but we'll do it real quick put the
17:14 - thought bubble back in there
17:16 - awesome
17:18 - click okay
17:20 - all right and then we need to apply some
17:22 - filters to this to make it just a solid
17:23 - white circle
17:25 - so
17:26 - uh filters
17:31 - oh yeah scroll down cache
17:34 - move it back up
17:36 - and then we're going to apply the color
17:38 - key filter
17:40 - so do this color key
17:42 - there we go
17:44 - um
17:46 - i could have named that better but
17:47 - anyways do a custom color
17:52 - i'm gonna do black
17:55 - alright now we just have a basically a
17:57 - white box in the same shape i'm going to
18:00 - change the color just a little bit
18:04 - wrong color forgot about that
18:07 - okay i want to change the color of it
18:09 - just a little bit because there's going
18:11 - to be a white presentation so it's just
18:12 - going to disappear so i'm going to do
18:14 - color correction
18:17 - i think i want to do that afterwards so
18:19 - i've moved it up
18:21 - select color
18:22 - gray
18:24 - all right and then
18:26 - is it brightness
18:29 - what's going on here oh yeah
18:32 - okay brightness yeah so it color
18:35 - correction needs to be below so we're
18:37 - making a little bit more gray i'm
18:38 - actually using saturation here
18:40 - i think it'll get it closer to the color
18:41 - it says
18:43 - anyways
18:46 - now all we're gonna do
18:47 - is not that
18:49 - not that at all
18:50 - so that'll happen a lot and how i get
18:52 - around that
18:55 - uh is i will lock it down
18:57 - you're locked down now you can't move
19:00 - all right
19:02 - and this is just kind of a cheeky way to
19:05 - do a border
19:06 - but it allows you to uh kind of
19:10 - someone put the webcam above it
19:14 - and
19:17 - and then i want to link these together
19:19 - so click this click this move this up
19:22 - move it there
19:24 - i'm going to lock these together by
19:26 - right clicking
19:27 - and then hit where is it at group
19:29 - selected items
19:30 - and now we have a webcam and a border
19:33 - hooray i think it makes it look more
19:35 - professional for sure
19:38 - all right
19:39 - moving on
19:41 - so the next step i know it's a little
19:43 - bit laborious guys
19:45 - but it does help
19:47 - add a little professionalism and it kind
19:48 - of shows you how to use masks and some
19:50 - other key elements we're going to create
19:52 - some twitter art
19:54 - let's add that
19:56 - we're going to do an image first we're
19:58 - going to call it twitter logo
20:01 - i got this logo off to twitter site
20:04 - you can download assets
20:06 - from them
20:08 - this is the round social media icon open
20:11 - that
20:13 - all right pretty big we're gonna make it
20:15 - smaller
20:16 - a lot smaller
20:18 - oh that big is good
20:20 - put it down here
20:22 - all right and then we're going to make a
20:24 - uh my twitter tag is at joe matthews okc
20:28 - we're going to do that now
20:30 - and this is this next step
20:33 - so we're gonna we're gonna add text
20:35 - we're gonna change the font size to be
20:36 - huge and that way we get sharper uh
20:38 - edges and then we'll scale it down and
20:40 - then we're gonna add a outline which is
20:42 - really only available in windows i try
20:44 - testing it and it might work in on mac
20:46 - but it doesn't work on linux yet you
20:48 - might need to add something to it to
20:49 - make it work
20:51 - to explain what's going on there i'm
20:53 - just going to call this at
20:55 - joe matthews
20:59 - okc
21:00 - i think i spelled that right i'm also
21:01 - going to copy that
21:03 - i'm about to type it again we've got
21:05 - text
21:06 - select font
21:08 - i'm just going to do 72
21:10 - so it makes it sharper
21:13 - all right i think ariel's fine
21:16 - go fancy if you want
21:18 - and so uh
21:19 - don't need to change anything here
21:21 - i think the color is fine for right now
21:24 - the background color i think that's fine
21:26 - it's it's just clear
21:29 - and so
21:30 - what we want is oop alignment go back is
21:33 - it left okay
21:35 - outline we're going to click that
21:37 - and then we're going to change the color
21:39 - i need to kind of find the twitter logo
21:42 - so we're going to change the outline
21:43 - color and we're going to make it the
21:44 - same as the twitter logo
21:46 - so how i did that again is i select
21:48 - color on outline so outline all in color
21:50 - select color
21:52 - pick color
21:53 - and then i just uh
21:54 - do it again
21:56 - let's hover over the twitter kind of
21:58 - like right in the middle
21:59 - bada bing bada boom
22:01 - and then so here it is it doesn't look
22:03 - that great so let's increase the outline
22:05 - let's do
22:07 - let's do five
22:09 - nope let's do more
22:11 - let's go more
22:13 - 30
22:14 - oh 30.
22:16 - well not let me do 30.
22:19 - rip off
22:22 - 20 is the highest 20 is enough though
22:24 - that looks good kind of looks like a red
22:26 - bubble sticker if you ever bought those
22:28 - i gave that analogy earlier crickets i
22:31 - like red bubble
22:33 - all right
22:35 - so we're going to resize this
22:37 - boom this will look a lot sharper on
22:39 - youtube
22:40 - it's scaling down the image
22:42 - and then i'm hitting control so it's
22:44 - wanted to snap this thing so it'll snap
22:47 - it a snap everywhere but i want it to be
22:48 - in the middle of the twitter logo
22:50 - so i'm going to hold ctrl and kind of
22:52 - just wing it
22:54 - and then i'm going to join these two
22:56 - together
22:57 - so how i do that is you can either do it
22:59 - here or on the
23:00 - screen itself hit control on both of
23:03 - them
23:04 - so like control click control click
23:06 - right click
23:08 - and then
23:09 - i already lost it
23:12 - can i not put these together group
23:16 - let's try it over here twitter logo
23:19 - group selected items okay i guess you
23:21 - have to do it rare
23:22 - now these are together now you can scale
23:24 - them they'll scale together
23:25 - uh it's your own personal logo you could
23:27 - make this in uh
23:29 - in in and photoshop and krita and
23:32 - have a transparent background have the
23:34 - same effect
23:36 - this is just kind of a way to do it in
23:37 - text
23:38 - and also to show you how text works
23:41 - anyways
23:44 - so i think we're about done we need to
23:45 - add one more source which is the big one
23:47 - which is the record the screen
23:49 - and so
23:50 - we don't need to hide the background
23:51 - it's going to be in memory anyway so
23:53 - we're just going to do plus
23:55 - and then we're going to do
23:57 - display capture i did want to point out
23:59 - one one other capture
24:02 - which is a good one windows capture
24:03 - let's go over that first we're not going
24:04 - to use it
24:06 - so windows capture i'm going to call it
24:08 - chrome only
24:11 - and this is a good way to kind of keep
24:12 - your privacy you know i like i think i
24:14 - closed everything before i came up here
24:16 - but if you're all tabbing and there's
24:18 - like messaging conversations up or
24:19 - whatever then they're gonna see it but
24:21 - this can be the window only that you're
24:22 - looking at so do chrome only
24:25 - and then
24:26 - that looks like a lot of gobbledygook so
24:28 - we need to find chrome
24:30 - eventually found it here and sometimes
24:32 - you'll see more than one dot exe look
24:35 - for the one that has the title you want
24:38 - oh no why is that not working
24:41 - oh i know why it's not working
24:43 - god
24:47 - i don't know why that's not working
24:51 - i'm going to have to troubleshoot that
24:52 - later
24:54 - oh let me check let me check the setting
24:58 - settings
24:59 - i don't think this will have anything to
25:00 - do with it
25:01 - oh okay so this sorry i'll show you
25:04 - where i went with the file
25:06 - settings
25:08 - i went to output
25:10 - and here you have an encoder setting so
25:11 - this is under recording an encoder this
25:14 - actually needs to be software it
25:16 - actually can be a hardware in e
25:20 - v e nc not a lot of gamers use that
25:23 - it's probably 10 20 faster
25:26 - on your computer
25:28 - but i got an error that
25:30 - i needed to update the drivers and so
25:32 - i'm just going to use software and i
25:34 - don't have an ok button so i'm going to
25:36 - scroll it down
25:38 - click apply click ok i don't know if
25:40 - that's why i'm not saying that so let me
25:42 - try
25:44 - getting a little nervous get rid of
25:45 - chrome only
25:49 - i'm going to just do straight to display
25:51 - capture but that's how you would capture
25:52 - just one window
25:54 - hopefully this works
25:56 - every
26:00 - window
26:01 - oh no it's the inception
26:04 - inception and so um this is kind of the
26:07 - most awful thing to see
26:09 - and you'll see it a lot in almost every
26:12 - almost every uh obs like if someone
26:14 - switches back to obs while they're
26:16 - streaming you'll see this it's kind of
26:18 - disorienting but it's just showing a
26:19 - mirror effect because it is recording
26:20 - within recording so
26:22 - uh we just click ok
26:25 - really annoying want to get out of here
26:26 - as soon as we can but what happened to
26:28 - all our stuff uh it's actually this
26:31 - floated the window to the top and so we
26:32 - need to on the sources list move this
26:34 - down so click the down arrow
26:36 - and stuff starts popping back up oh too
26:38 - far
26:40 - all right
26:41 - is that exciting guys
26:44 - so far so good
26:47 - all right
26:49 - so uh we'll get into the meat and
26:50 - potatoes a little bit
26:53 - and so the presentation itself is to go
26:55 - full on we're going to set up obs which
26:57 - we just just did we're going to record a
27:00 - presentation which is going to be pretty
27:01 - short and then we're going to upload
27:02 - that to youtube
27:04 - and i might do another talk later where
27:05 - i go advanced obs stuff as i learn more
27:09 - um
27:11 - but we do have some bonus things at the
27:12 - end to keep in mind
27:14 - um not gonna do the browser one but
27:16 - basically we're gonna do we are gonna
27:18 - add spotify so we're going to add album
27:20 - art to obs and i'll show you how to do
27:22 - that using masks
27:24 - getting back to the good stuff
27:26 - and so i'm going to start the recording
27:29 - and no errors which is good
27:33 - and so it shows stop recording now
27:36 - and so we're going to go back to chrome
27:39 - did not mean to close it all the way
27:40 - down i don't think
27:42 - go back to my slides
27:45 - here's the presentation you saw before
27:48 - it's a little bit tongue-in-cheek this
27:49 - is kind of meant to be fast
27:53 - and the main content of what you're
27:54 - learning is supposed to be in the actual
27:56 - demonstration itself
27:59 - and so here we go recording
28:00 - presentations using obs and youtube
28:05 - and so what is obs
28:10 - obs stands for open broadcaster software
28:13 - it's created by hugh jim bailey and many
28:15 - contributors a lot of people have helped
28:17 - out on this
28:18 - the first release was in september 2012.
28:22 - there's presets for streaming to twitch
28:24 - youtube instagram facebook and others
28:28 - it's open source software so that means
28:30 - anyone can contribute to it anyone can
28:31 - make it better
28:32 - it's probably going to be free forever
28:35 - and it's uh licensed to gnu gpl v2
28:38 - that's a general public license
28:41 - and that means that if anyone improves
28:43 - it they have to contribute the code back
28:45 - to the the main repository and make that
28:47 - code available
28:49 - or they don't have to contribute back
28:50 - they have to make it available
28:52 - so it's a really good thing it's
28:54 - community driven software
28:56 - and it is the number one software for
28:59 - streaming uh it's also very popular for
29:01 - recording screens because the ability to
29:03 - add webcams and control audio and just
29:05 - the amount of settings you can do you
29:07 - can control everything on it i was
29:08 - telling other people if you can see it
29:10 - on your computer you can put it on your
29:12 - stream
29:14 - so that alternatives to obs
29:16 - a little troll move here
29:19 - they probably have 99
29:22 - market share and they don't charge a
29:23 - dime and so um i wouldn't recommend
29:26 - using anything else i'm not going to
29:28 - tell you to use anything else
29:30 - i'm not going to mention names that's
29:32 - because that's how much i love obs
29:34 - i showed you a little bit with masks you
29:36 - can do a lot with masks and you can do a
29:38 - lot with browser
29:39 - integration too that's how you get the
29:41 - magical pop pop up on the screens when
29:43 - you're watching twitch well we'll get to
29:46 - that
29:47 - but i will show you how to
29:49 - use mask to get
29:51 - spotify on there using uh
29:53 - non-copyrighted music of course
29:56 - right kimberly right
29:58 - all right
30:00 - and so
30:01 - the actual the like this is going on
30:03 - youtube uh but this is going on youtube
30:06 - after what we're actually recording
30:08 - right now so it's a little bit of
30:09 - recording inception
30:11 - um so my detailed obs setup presentation
30:14 - for obs oh man i've repeated obs yes
30:17 - it's embarrassing it's coming soon to
30:19 - youtube
30:20 - the presentation is actually created
30:21 - right now during that presentation from
30:23 - the future that's a little hard to
30:25 - explain but everything you're seeing me
30:26 - doing right now is going to be the
30:28 - second video in the series we're about
30:29 - to upload the first which is this
30:31 - presentation that i hit start recording
30:32 - on
30:33 - i created a logo for part two because
30:35 - like back to the future marty mcfly is
30:37 - visiting himself at the the dance
30:39 - it's pretty cool
30:42 - so what is youtube
30:45 - i know what youtube is everyone's saying
30:48 - why is youtube important you know but
30:50 - why record presentations why add content
30:54 - for me personally it's kind of a
30:55 - personal thing youtube has been very
30:57 - powerful for me i've learned excel i've
30:59 - learned programming learned a lot of
31:00 - things that you'd expect me to learn in
31:02 - my profession but also i learned how to
31:04 - stain concrete in my new house i learned
31:07 - how to repair a leaky bathtub i didn't
31:09 - think i could do that
31:10 - i learned how to paint a house the right
31:12 - way you actually have to clean it with
31:13 - soap
31:14 - that way the paint doesn't peel off it's
31:15 - on there like it's on there hardcore now
31:17 - and etc i've learned a lot of things i
31:21 - don't necessarily think i could do
31:22 - better videos than that what i can do is
31:24 - do
31:25 - programming videos i can do obs videos
31:27 - and this is kind of my first video to
31:29 - youtube
31:30 - promote yourself you know show what
31:32 - you've what you're good at what you've
31:34 - made
31:36 - um
31:37 - you know uh show your communication
31:39 - skills to your new employer
31:41 - um
31:42 - show uh show what you're worth to a
31:43 - little bit give back that's the kind of
31:45 - thing it's like i can i can do i can't
31:47 - do a lot of videos but i can do an obs
31:49 - video
31:50 - um and also learn better so this is kind
31:53 - of like the last minute ad here but it
31:55 - but it's important me me doing this like
31:57 - i would consider myself like you know
32:00 - like a mid-tier you know wizard as far
32:02 - as obs goes
32:04 - i think i could figure out a lot of
32:05 - things using masks and using web
32:08 - to get almost anything to work
32:10 - but just making this presentation i had
32:12 - to kind of re-clarify some conceptions i
32:14 - had some misconceptions things didn't
32:16 - work as i expected them to so putting
32:18 - this all together i learned obs better
32:20 - and so putting a presentation together
32:23 - alone
32:24 - may help you learn it better
32:26 - and of course since this is being seen
32:28 - on youtube like comment and subscribe
32:30 - please
32:32 - all right that's the last slide from
32:33 - there i'm gonna go and click back off
32:35 - hit stop recording
32:39 - all right and so
32:41 - what's next
32:43 - so we recorded we click the the start
32:45 - recording button do the presentation
32:48 - click the stop recording button i wanted
32:49 - to add one more thing because i'm all
32:51 - about being transparent about hang ups
32:54 - here let's get rid of this inception
32:55 - thing going on here
32:58 - it's really trippy all right
33:00 - so if we go to settings and so if you
33:02 - try to do start present or start
33:04 - recording and you get an error
33:06 - the error might be caused by what i
33:08 - checked earlier so if you go to out
33:10 - output
33:11 - go to encoder
33:12 - uh you might try software encoder
33:14 - because the error might be about ndv
33:17 - what does that say
33:19 - nvenc
33:20 - all right
33:22 - so what's the next step
33:24 - all right let's upload it to youtube
33:27 - sounds reasonable
33:29 - all right let me close this out
33:32 - i'm going to go to youtube
33:40 - and i did a teaser video before i
33:42 - actually did a lot of teaser videos only
33:44 - one
33:44 - got chosen
33:47 - i'm going to my channel
33:49 - i'm very new to youtube and uploading
33:51 - videos so i just did youtube studio over
33:53 - here on the right
33:54 - there's probably people in here that are
33:56 - masters at youtube and let's talk
33:59 - let's connect
34:00 - and then
34:02 - uh
34:03 - dashboard
34:05 - no
34:06 - videos
34:09 - plus
34:13 - uploads
34:15 - oh man so before i just had a big fat
34:17 - upload new video
34:21 - if anyone wants to bail me out
34:23 - how do i upload a new video
34:29 - right here
34:30 - let's do it
34:31 - yes
34:34 - the icon was obvious all right and so
34:37 - i'm just gonna go
34:39 - nope i'm gonna do uh private
34:42 - that's because we need to trim it
34:45 - and so i set it to go to videos
34:49 - oh so many videos i'm going to sort by
34:51 - date real quick
34:52 - 237 it's about right
34:55 - open
34:58 - all right title
35:00 - oh
35:03 - so
35:04 - recording
35:06 - presentations
35:08 - with obs
35:10 - and i'll do a regular hand youtube
35:13 - part one
35:15 - all right
35:20 - here i
35:22 - give an introduction to youtube or to
35:26 - obs
35:28 - and youtube
35:30 - uh
35:31 - part
35:33 - two
35:34 - will give the details
35:38 - on how
35:39 - i created
35:41 - this presentation
35:43 - oh i think it's done
35:46 - oh processing 95. okay i'm gonna go
35:48 - ahead and click click done
35:51 - all right
35:54 - so
35:54 - return to youtube studio beta
36:01 - okay i want to go to
36:04 - click on
36:05 - one of my videos
36:09 - here we go
36:10 - click on this
36:12 - there we go editor
36:14 - so editor allow you to trim the
36:16 - beginning and the end of a video
36:18 - and we're going to do that to make this
36:19 - a little bit more professional
36:21 - here you can zoom to uh to get more of a
36:24 - timeline so you can fine tune it a
36:25 - little bit better
36:27 - so right
36:28 - oh we have to hit trim so it's hit trim
36:31 - right about here
36:35 - i think
36:38 - okay
36:39 - and then
36:42 - uh
36:44 - did it automatically trim it what
36:45 - happened here
36:47 - do i need to scroll
36:49 - oh let's zoom out
36:55 - okay okay
36:59 - there we go
37:03 - all right
37:06 - trim split cancel
37:10 - i would expect me to do a preview
37:14 - oh
37:16 - from there i'm gonna go click back off
37:18 - stop recording
37:22 - okay
37:24 - why is this not working anyone know any
37:27 - professionals
37:32 - oh because i didn't do any trimming
37:35 - oh
37:36 - okay
37:40 - i swear i did
37:43 - okay
37:44 - i think that's about good right there
37:47 - okay
37:52 - preview
37:55 - and we're going to listen to this
37:57 - i'm joking
37:59 - so what is
38:01 - does that really just happen what
38:02 - happened
38:15 - so what is
38:29 - so that's going to cook
38:31 - and that is basically how to do all of
38:33 - what i promised to do on that
38:34 - presentation
38:35 - and so with that you can uh record
38:38 - almost anything
38:40 - you could
38:41 - play a video in the background record
38:42 - yourself commentating on that a lot of
38:44 - stuff you can do um including uh gaming
38:48 - and so if you want to do gaming the only
38:50 - real difference is you plug in a twitch
38:53 - key
38:54 - into uh obs settings go through that uh
38:59 - go through that uh
39:01 - the the getting started
39:03 - it's not tutorial
39:04 - but a section at the twitch key
39:08 - um that's almost concludes my
39:10 - presentation
39:12 - i wanted to show you spotify i'll need
39:14 - to show you uh using browser stuff later
39:16 - so browser stuff is the real powerful
39:18 - stuff but uh one thing i ran into
39:21 - i was telling some as i walked into the
39:23 - uh walked into the presentation here i
39:26 - wanted to be a counter-strike star you
39:29 - know i wanted to kill nubs uh on the
39:31 - internets um and do it on twitch so i
39:34 - learned a lot of obs uh to to do good
39:36 - production value for that and one of the
39:39 - things i really wanted
39:41 - was to add
39:43 - a spotify
39:45 - like album art and song playing
39:48 - to the stream
39:49 - i'm sure there's ways to do that are
39:50 - very hacky
39:52 - using apis and stuff like that
39:55 - but i did find a way to use you know
39:57 - along the principles if you can see it
39:59 - you can add it and so i created a mask
40:01 - for spotify
40:03 - and so
40:05 - whoa
40:06 - not that mask
40:07 - so if i open up spotify here
40:12 - all right
40:13 - and uh one thing i did to try to find
40:15 - good music to play because if you play
40:18 - music just as a normal user
40:20 - they will mute your entire um broadcast
40:24 - that's recorded
40:26 - and
40:27 - and also i think you're held to a higher
40:29 - standard if you're educational source
40:31 - they might send you a message be like
40:32 - don't do that
40:34 - and so they're basically looking for
40:35 - copyrighted music
40:38 - i think it's very much a slap on a wrist
40:39 - now but it's always good to just not
40:42 - mess with it
40:44 - and so i type in twitch fm here
40:47 - and that brings up this profile i don't
40:48 - know if it's official or not but it does
40:50 - have i've seen this before the the no
40:52 - copyright sounds which is a group that
40:54 - puts out music for people
40:56 - uh and anyone can play it
40:58 - and so
40:59 - [Music]
41:00 - um most of the album art's the same
41:02 - which is unfortunate
41:03 - so you can find one that's different
41:05 - i don't think it's actually changing
41:07 - anyway so let's try starbound
41:11 - wait a minute
41:17 - i think they're all the same oh there's
41:19 - one yay
41:21 - okay
41:22 - and so i wanted to show you the changing
41:24 - of artwork so i wanted to basically get
41:25 - this out of spotify and put it into my
41:28 - uh into my twitch or into my obs you can
41:32 - do this during a presentation if you
41:33 - wanted to uh that you just record and
41:36 - not stream
41:37 - and so
41:38 - i'll leave this chill music play in the
41:40 - background turn it down a little bit
41:42 - [Music]
41:46 - all right
41:47 - and so what we're gonna do
41:49 - is we're actually going to use a mask
41:51 - and so hopefully this will work it was a
41:53 - little finicky earlier we're gonna do
41:55 - window capture again
41:56 - uh we're gonna name this spotify
42:00 - okay
42:01 - and then we're gonna go down and choose
42:03 - spotify
42:04 - so here we go lars them over i think
42:06 - that's the song that's playing choose
42:08 - that yeah it popped up
42:10 - so i'm gonna grab this
42:12 - and so what i actually did is gonna add
42:14 - that
42:15 - that's just going to pop over
42:17 - it is 720p so it takes a full screen
42:20 - and so
42:22 - uh it's up here at the top i'm going to
42:23 - do filters
42:37 - and so uh we're gonna add a filter add a
42:40 - mask again just like we did for the
42:41 - webcam
42:44 - all right let's show you what this mask
42:46 - is i made this in paint as well to make
42:48 - sure i can do it but basically i took a
42:51 - screenshot i'll just do it right now
42:53 - screenshot
42:55 - and then paint
42:58 - i'm not gonna actually do the mask
42:59 - because it's gonna be a little
43:00 - challenging paste this in here
43:03 - and basically i added a white box
43:06 - i said i'm not gonna do it but here it
43:08 - goes
43:09 - and then i just uh
43:10 - went over it with the white box
43:14 - all right and then uh
43:16 - uh i colored all this black to show you
43:18 - real quick how that happened but i did i
43:20 - zoomed in to try to make it pixel
43:22 - perfect as i can get them kind of like
43:23 - that i colored everything black around
43:26 - it
43:27 - so just double click make sure it's like
43:29 - that's not really black that sort of
43:30 - thing and then you just take this black
43:32 - thing
43:34 - and i said i wasn't gonna do it but i'm
43:35 - actually doing it
43:37 - all right
43:39 - uh all right so
43:42 - oh my gosh i clicked you
43:45 - why won't that work
43:48 - it doesn't select it
43:55 - anyways you change it to black as the uh
43:57 - the box and you just highlight it all to
43:58 - get it all out of there you do you also
44:01 - have to remove this bottom bar because
44:02 - it does not include an obs so all i did
44:04 - was do is drag that out
44:07 - there you go look at all this black and
44:09 - that turns into
44:13 - this is a 720p
44:15 - basically uh obs
44:18 - mask for spotify
44:23 - drags on me
44:24 - and so we go browse
44:26 - click that
44:27 - and then all it gets the album artwork
44:30 - for close
44:32 - i'm gonna go drag that to the side over
44:33 - here
44:35 - and just to show you i'm going to use my
44:36 - keyboard to change album
44:39 - and so if i do uh for me i have to
44:41 - function the next song
44:43 - it changes the album and it shows who's
44:45 - playing below that'll look a lot sharper
44:47 - on stream
44:48 - all right so
44:51 - did i close my presentation
44:54 - and so that i think concludes my
44:57 - presentation on how to use obs
45:02 - to
45:03 - record
45:04 - your presentation and upload it to
45:06 - youtube um i'd like to go more in depth
45:08 - on certain topics it gets pretty
45:10 - technical at some point um but i'd be
45:12 - very curious to hear what you all think
45:14 - you can do joe matthews okc on twitter
45:17 - let me know what you
45:19 - what you'd like to try and i can maybe
45:21 - figure it out with you
45:23 - other than that any questions
45:26 - any hey
45:28 - can people share filters
45:31 - so you're talking about taking like that
45:33 - spotify and kind of exporting that
45:36 - and so one way to do that and this is
45:38 - new
45:39 - i believe it's new or else i missed it
45:41 - the first time is if i wanted to extract
45:43 - all this i'm kind of doing this live
45:45 - with you because i just found out about
45:46 - it if you do tools
45:49 - okay hey calm down
45:51 - [Music]
45:54 - but if you do tools
45:56 - and then you do
45:58 - tools scene there we go scene collection
46:01 - and then uh we have a untitled can i do
46:04 - save as i can't do save as why is it
46:06 - untitled if you can't save it um i guess
46:08 - you can do new and then you name it
46:10 - anyway so i'm on untitled right now i do
46:12 - export
46:14 - and then i put that anywhere i want to
46:16 - put an obs i already did it right here
46:22 - i can call this presentation scenes
46:28 - okay save
46:31 - let's go see what that looks like though
46:33 - uh presentation scenes open with code
46:36 - all right and so that's what this looks
46:38 - like it looks very editable which is
46:40 - amazing and so i'm pretty sure if you
46:43 - were to send this to a friend
46:45 - uh all they would have to do is have uh
46:48 - all the files that are in the same
46:50 - folder
46:51 - it might need to i don't know you'd have
46:53 - to you'd have to check it out yeah so
46:55 - it's hard coding this and so you'd have
46:57 - to go through and kind of change it but
46:59 - it's more of a backup for yourself
47:02 - and these and these obs profiles are
47:05 - kind of
47:06 - what makes streamers money so
47:09 - there's not much sharing going on in
47:10 - general but
47:11 - uh
47:14 - as far as i've seen
47:16 - but i guess that is an awesome new
47:18 - feature because that wasn't possible it
47:20 - might have been in settings like deep
47:21 - buried in i just didn't know where it
47:22 - was but that export option's there and
47:25 - you can back that up because you can
47:26 - spend hours days doing that and obs
47:30 - might crap out on you one day but it's
47:31 - nice to have that backup
47:33 - it's never ever deleted a config file on
47:35 - me though unlike other broadcasting
47:37 - software
47:38 - i've heard about
47:40 - and so any any was that did i answer
47:42 - your question
47:43 - all right
47:44 - anyone else
47:50 - oh
47:51 - tough question um the best i understand
47:54 - it and if anyone is
47:57 - uh
47:58 - like an engineer
48:00 - raise your hand hurry
48:02 - hurry
48:03 - damn it and so video bitrate um i know
48:06 - that is 3 000 recommended by twitch for
48:08 - 1080p
48:10 - i think it's 2000 or 2200 for 720p
48:14 - and uh so it's currently set at 25 which
48:17 - would be a great 720p stream the best i
48:20 - know it uses flv but i did not look that
48:23 - up let's look up what that means it's
48:25 - flash live video
48:28 - f
48:29 - lv format
48:31 - and what this allows
48:33 - what this allows is twitch to get your
48:36 - content and also it's
48:38 - we recorded it it's the same format we
48:40 - recorded and uploaded youtube it allows
48:42 - twitch to get your contact uh content
48:44 - without letting it
48:46 - finish recording and so it's getting it
48:48 - at a 2500 bit rate
48:50 - and uh
48:52 - and it's allowing everyone to view that
48:53 - at the same the moment it hits twitch
48:55 - servers everyone can access your content
48:58 - it's a very kind of efficient way to
49:00 - to get that out there um
49:02 - and so
49:03 - i do know the recommended what does it
49:06 - say what it stands for
49:08 - flash flash video all right
49:10 - fl okay yeah the l is the f
49:14 - l on flash but uh twitch
49:16 - recommended
49:18 - bitrate
49:20 - um
49:21 - i will speak from personal experience do
49:23 - not cheap out on a router don't do it
49:26 - get the i got the
49:28 - the best of the best i don't know like
49:30 - it's like advertisement i think it's
49:33 - 3200 uh acm
49:36 - yeah
49:37 - um
49:38 - this boy is mean it is i would consider
49:41 - it the best they have one that's set up
49:42 - just for xbox but i would consider this
49:44 - one
49:45 - the best router you can buy i got it for
49:47 - 150 refurbished from uh
49:49 - walmart you can put open source software
49:52 - on it to make it do whatever you want
49:54 - and i wouldn't recommend that because uh
49:56 - well i would recommend it you just might
49:58 - not have a router for a while
50:00 - uh
50:01 - but it's really it's uh
50:03 - but yeah so
50:04 - uses open wrt for that
50:07 - and
50:08 - this will help your stream
50:10 - the most it handles the bit rate and
50:12 - make sure you don't do packet losses
50:13 - during that bit rate um when you're
50:16 - transferring it i've had a lot of issues
50:18 - on twitch i traced the cable back and it
50:20 - was the router
50:21 - and um
50:22 - i hate to say just buy more money but
50:25 - spend more money but as long as we're in
50:27 - our current standard
50:29 - ac standard i guess for wi-fi this is
50:32 - going to be the best router until we
50:34 - move to something new um
50:36 - question
50:38 - oh yeah yeah that's for sure uh but even
50:41 - if you do that
50:43 - that's a good point
50:46 - repeat the question oh man thank you
50:48 - austin
50:50 - the question was the question before
50:52 - that was i i think just general
50:54 - questions about explaining bitrate
50:56 - i'm not engineer i don't know
50:58 - the second question was could you not
51:00 - just connect directly in the router and
51:02 - that is correct
51:05 - and
51:06 - and so
51:07 - i got a little bit off on a tangent
51:08 - right there i love i love open wrt i
51:11 - kind of sprung off on that um
51:14 - some routers have 100 megabyte
51:16 - connections and some have gigabit
51:18 - connections and even if you have gigabit
51:20 - it's still being processed and so the
51:23 - more memory that that router has the
51:24 - more processing power that has
51:27 - like this is a lan party router for
51:29 - probably like 10 people
51:32 - you could i think on most any router
51:33 - you're right just connect directly and
51:36 - stream while uh
51:38 - everyone else because it's mainly about
51:40 - upload but you can stream while everyone
51:41 - else is doing normal stuff on the
51:43 - internet so
51:44 - that's a very good question wi-fi though
51:46 - uh the bigger the router the better the
51:48 - router the better
51:50 - but it
51:51 - you should be connected directly i
51:52 - didn't mean for this to be a stream to
51:54 - twitch
51:55 - talk
51:56 - teklahoma does stream to twitch too
51:58 - so it is very relevant to obs
52:01 - this is mainly about the recording the
52:03 - presentation part
52:04 - any other questions
52:08 - no
52:09 - i can always talk afterwards
52:12 - i really like this because i'll use this
52:14 - youtube video to show my son so he can
52:16 - get jump in and get started with obs and
52:18 - twitch pretty soon and i meant to kind
52:21 - of do this for him
52:23 - just i think kim really is really good
52:25 - at making me collect my thoughts and
52:26 - learn
52:27 - so
52:29 - kind of learn you know walk the
52:31 - walk the walk type of thing and that's
52:32 - kind of what i did for here
52:34 - all right
52:35 - thank you all and uh i'll be here for a
52:38 - little bit to answer questions thank you
