00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse and today i'm going
00:08 - to try to fix the problem that we
00:11 - encountered yesterday
00:14 - and there were a few reasons why that
00:16 - was happening
00:18 - and so i'm going to share with you a
00:19 - couple of the reasons
00:21 - and
00:22 - then we're going to try to fix it if you
00:24 - didn't see yesterday's video here's a
00:26 - quick recap of what we tried to do
00:30 - we started up a
00:33 - sql a mysql database on google's cloud
00:36 - platform
00:38 - and
00:39 - we
00:40 - took our wordpress mysql database that
00:43 - we've been using for this project
00:45 - and we made a copy
00:48 - and then we sent that copy over to the
00:51 - new database that we're running on
00:52 - google's cloud platform
00:54 - so
00:55 - the database is there the tables are
00:57 - there we verified that
01:01 - but we couldn't connect
01:05 - we were attempting to host wordpress
01:08 - with
01:09 - now
01:10 - from zeit and we couldn't get it to
01:13 - connect to the database and that's kind
01:15 - of where we left off
01:17 - yesterday
01:18 - so i thought a lot about it
01:21 - i couldn't even though i stopped working
01:23 - i did not stop thinking about that
01:25 - problem which i don't know if that
01:26 - happens to you all but that frequently
01:28 - happens to me like if there's a problem
01:31 - i didn't solve i
01:32 - i just keep thinking about it all the
01:35 - time i think maybe it'd be better if i
01:37 - just worked until i fixed it and then i
01:39 - could be at peace but
01:42 - in this case
01:45 - i think i've found the solution but i
01:48 - haven't had time to test it yet
01:50 - the solution is
01:52 - from what i understand
01:55 - in addition to a few other adjustments
01:58 - we're going to
01:59 - make a proxy
02:02 - because
02:04 - we authorize some ip addresses some
02:06 - networks unfortunately when you host the
02:09 - site with now you don't have an ip
02:12 - address it changes too often so they
02:13 - don't even give you the ip address
02:16 - uh of your your instance of whatever
02:20 - you're running with now so in cases
02:23 - where you can't give them an ip address
02:26 - google's cloud sql offers the option of
02:29 - running a proxy and accessing it like
02:32 - that
02:33 - there's also a further complication
02:38 - that harshit found and that was
02:44 - we were
02:46 - the example we were using to run
02:48 - wordpress with now was assuming
02:50 - that we were using aws
02:53 - and their security
02:55 - so
02:56 - we we may need to go in and disable some
02:58 - of that stuff too
03:01 - but first i definitely want to
03:05 - get this proxy set up so i haven't done
03:07 - this before
03:09 - we're going to go through it together i
03:11 - have the instructions up here somewhere
03:12 - i'm going to paste in a link to the
03:14 - instructions so you all can check that
03:15 - out with me
03:19 - and
03:21 - let's see
03:23 - hey hey everybody uh
03:26 - see there's a few you saying hi
03:29 - yeah let's
03:33 - let's get started
03:36 - so as soon as i find those instructions
03:40 - i'm gonna send them all to you and we're
03:42 - gonna get started so here they are
03:46 - there in the chat now
03:48 - if you have trouble clicking on that to
03:50 - and it doesn't open then try copying and
03:53 - pasting it
03:56 - and
04:01 - let's see
04:03 - all right i'm gonna make sure i have
04:04 - this up on one of my other screens
04:08 - and we can get started with that
04:20 - my computer if my fan is running too
04:22 - loud and that's bothering you let me
04:24 - know i tried closing down as much as i
04:27 - could and i can't figure out what is
04:29 - running
04:30 - uh and causing the fan to uh to
04:34 - run in overdrive like that
04:37 - all right so let me let's move over to
04:39 - the split screen
04:42 - there we are
04:46 - okay harshit is making a pull request
04:50 - right now to fix some of those issues so
04:54 - i'm gonna wait and pull down the latest
04:56 - changes before we do anything on this uh
04:59 - repo that you see here
05:01 - uh and what i'm gonna do instead is go
05:04 - through
05:06 - let's start this timer and let me pull
05:08 - this over here
05:10 - and let's go through some of these
05:13 - instructions
05:17 - try to get this working
05:20 - all right
05:24 - we can see here the proxy what it's
05:26 - going to do for us is
05:29 - it's going to let us access
05:31 - our server
05:33 - our database here without white listing
05:36 - ip addresses so that's what we we can't
05:39 - white list because we don't have you
05:41 - know a static ip address or even really
05:43 - a range that we could set
05:46 - so
05:51 - i guess we could y'all can read this if
05:53 - you want more info but uh the graphics
05:56 - are nice
05:57 - uh so
06:02 - this is how it's going to connect
06:06 - uh instead of going directly
06:09 - to
06:10 - uh cloud sql
06:12 - obviously the proxy lets us
06:16 - go to the proxy and then go to cloud sql
06:18 - so uh pretty simple concept uh i at
06:23 - least i think let me know if it's if
06:24 - it's not i have been reading up on this
06:27 - for a while so if you
06:29 - i may have a slight advantage at
06:30 - understanding it
06:34 - okay
06:38 - all right so we've enabled the api so we
06:41 - did that yesterday
06:44 - we need these gcp authentication
06:47 - credentials
06:49 - so i'm just going to open that another
06:50 - window for right now
06:52 - valid database user account password we
06:55 - set that up yesterday
06:58 - your instance must have an external ip
07:01 - address which we we have
07:07 - alright awesome so
07:12 - let's um
07:16 - let's try this out and try this out on
07:18 - our
07:19 - i'm using a mac right now
07:21 - so
07:22 - let's get to our command line and let me
07:25 - organize this a bit better
07:27 - all right so let's go over to our
07:28 - command line
07:31 - and
07:36 - yeah i'll just open up a new window here
07:40 - all right so we're going to download
07:41 - this great downloaded so quickly and
07:45 - then
07:46 - we're gonna make it executable
07:49 - great
08:02 - we need to provide it with
08:04 - this info so we should have all this
08:06 - info
08:08 - stay to come if you're application we
08:10 - sent the clouds
08:13 - go find credentials
08:15 - here's what's on the cage
08:17 - okay great so impressed
08:33 - okay i'm just scanning over this
08:36 - i think it's always good practice to
08:38 - read all the instructions before doing
08:40 - it
08:40 - um
08:43 - i don't know when i'm cooking it always
08:44 - helps with the recipe if i know what's
08:46 - going to happen ahead of time so i'm not
08:47 - going to read it all i'm just going to
08:49 - scan a bit
09:10 - hmm
09:32 - all right this is good we're gonna they
09:35 - have a github page just for this that
09:37 - we're using which is awesome
09:59 - all right so we are just testing this
10:01 - right now but eventually we would have
10:03 - to go to this step if we end up using
10:05 - this so
10:08 - let's go
10:10 - now i can't find where i left off
10:18 - all right we'll see how do we want to
10:20 - provide these
10:21 - credentials
10:24 - all right
10:40 - you can create a credential file
10:55 - hmm
11:16 - okay
11:22 - all right so we have a few more people
11:24 - joining us for those of you that are
11:25 - joining i just want to reiterate we're
11:27 - going through this process i've never
11:29 - done this before so that's why there's a
11:31 - bit of silence on my part from kind of
11:33 - reading over this
11:36 - i am going to check the chat because it
11:37 - looks like there's a lot in here
11:48 - um
12:02 - okay
12:03 - so it it does look like uh harshit made
12:06 - a pull request there so when the time
12:08 - comes we're gonna to put bringing his
12:09 - pool requests
12:13 - before we attempt to
12:16 - connect everything
12:18 - the wordpress
12:20 - instance to this database
12:23 - um
12:25 - let's see
12:26 - okay i'll go through if you have asked
12:28 - some questions i will uh answer those
12:30 - questions as soon as our pomodoro timer
12:32 - is up so we have about 17 minutes left
12:34 - here
12:35 - uh at this point
12:39 - let me let me paste this in the chat as
12:41 - well and then that way you can check out
12:42 - the tool that we were using that we just
12:46 - loaded that i just loaded locally
12:50 - and
12:53 - i guess
12:54 - for those of you that weren't here
12:55 - earlier here's the page for the
12:57 - instructions we're following
13:00 - okay
13:02 - so here's some example invocations
13:08 - so let's check this out
13:32 - hmm
13:41 - i guess we can try one of these
13:52 - all right so let me try
13:57 - let's move over to here
14:02 - just to
14:03 - change this up so we we do need to
14:05 - replace
14:17 - you need
14:32 - so i'm trying to figure out where
14:33 - they're expecting this to be run from
15:23 - hmm
15:36 - all right
15:37 - let's see
15:41 - all right so i'm not exactly sure let me
15:43 - tell you what i'm i'm thinking right now
15:44 - what i'm not sure about i may just end
15:46 - up copying some stuff and throwing it in
15:47 - the command line just to see if it works
15:50 - uh because
15:52 - we read up here
15:55 - a little earlier
15:59 - i guess up here
16:03 - first it was talking about loading this
16:05 - proxy on your local machine
16:07 - and then it was saying
16:10 - uh something about
16:14 - running it in the google cloud platform
16:17 - console
16:20 - which which i mean that's definitely two
16:22 - different things so i'm trying to
16:27 - to figure out
16:29 - what they want
16:49 - um
16:54 - let's go
17:07 - all right so we have that cloud sql
17:09 - proxy
17:13 - all right good it's not a directory
17:15 - let's see if we can
17:16 - just whenever i just do run
17:21 - run is not a command what's the
17:22 - equivalent command
17:45 - actually maybe i'll just look here
18:00 - okay
18:02 - of course
18:10 - all right so we definitely need default
18:11 - credentials
18:18 - which is what we're trying to do over
18:19 - here
18:30 - i just need to figure out what the
18:33 - credentials are
18:35 - and actually this this will help
18:51 - okay
18:53 - we have this info
18:56 - i'm just gonna grab it from
19:23 - okay
19:26 - and
19:37 - i wonder
19:38 - if
19:40 - this is going to be the database name
19:46 - let's see if this is what they want
19:52 - all right i'm not sure if they want like
19:54 - the main name for the google cloud
19:55 - account or the database username we'll
19:58 - find out
20:00 - all right so let's try this out now
20:04 - what's
20:05 - wordpress command i found all right so
20:07 - obviously that was not what they needed
20:15 - so let's try it again
20:33 - uh shoot it's treating it like two
20:35 - different commands
20:44 - let's see
21:15 - hmm
21:31 - all right
21:42 - just i'm checking back in the chat to
21:44 - see if
21:45 - see if i've lost all of you
21:47 - uh
21:48 - since i'm a bit lost myself all right so
21:52 - i mean at this point
21:57 - i'm just gonna try a few more variations
22:00 - on this
22:02 - uh on this command and see if i can get
22:07 - uh something different to come up
22:09 - uh even if it's a different error
22:11 - message that's going to be progress
22:13 - uh if it doesn't work after a few more
22:15 - tries then i'll just go back to the
22:16 - documentation make sure i didn't miss a
22:18 - step
22:24 - all right
23:00 - you know what
23:02 - let's let me double check
23:06 - this i think
23:11 - there was something
23:33 - yeah maybe since we're doing this
23:35 - locally right now
23:37 - that's equal to you
23:38 - using mph
23:53 - all right so anyway this is what i was
23:54 - looking for the enable the api i just
23:56 - want to double check that we have
23:58 - enabled the proper api
24:04 - shhh
24:23 - okay
24:28 - all right now that that's enabled
24:31 - i'm just gonna try to run this again
24:35 - all right nothing okay let's try these
24:37 - instructions
24:39 - for now just to get something working
24:41 - and um
24:44 - then
24:45 - we can
24:46 - we can move on i mean i think it it may
24:49 - at the very least help us to rule out
24:51 - like where where am i making this
24:53 - mistake at
24:59 - if you haven't already installed g click
25:01 - command line tool
25:09 - all right so there is a gcloud command
25:11 - line tool
25:14 - awesome
25:44 - uh
25:44 - let's see
25:46 - i guess we'll download that real quick
26:10 - um
26:32 - welcome to the cloud sdk yay
26:35 - yes
26:41 - yes
26:52 - great
26:59 - so we just installed this uh google
27:01 - cloud
27:03 - stuff
27:19 - would you like to log in sure
27:33 - take a clog project to use
27:43 - five
28:00 - one
28:05 - all right awesome
28:08 - okay looks like we're all set then to
28:10 - continue on
28:13 - with these instructions and i'm going to
28:16 - minimize these
28:18 - it looks like we're almost ready for
28:20 - question time
28:23 - so
28:25 - i'll hear a little beep soon
28:31 - we done that
28:32 - let's use this quick start
28:43 - all right we've already done this
28:50 - it's details connection since
28:54 - this is connection name we've already
28:55 - done that
28:57 - so you already have copied the instance
28:58 - connection name
29:02 - start the proxy in its own terminal she
29:04 - can modernize output
29:07 - we're going to replace instant
29:08 - connection name
29:13 - all right so let's copy that
29:18 - and replace
29:20 - instance connection
29:22 - name with this
29:43 - i cannot find credentials
30:00 - login
30:07 - i thought we already did this
30:16 - all right then
30:27 - all right let me run this and then we'll
30:28 - do questions
30:30 - hey great
30:34 - wonderful
30:41 - all right so we got
30:44 - down to this step
30:47 - for it to work
30:49 - cool
30:50 - all right so that's like not nearly
30:52 - where we need to be at but it's the
30:54 - first step so
30:56 - let's take a short break and i'm gonna
30:59 - answer some questions
31:14 - uh jeremy asks at a high level what's
31:16 - the value add slash purpose for using
31:19 - the proxy the proxy allows us
31:22 - let me back up so
31:24 - normally you would have an ip address
31:27 - white list and only
31:30 - connect incoming connections from those
31:32 - ip addresses would be allowed
31:34 - for that sql database
31:39 - but we
31:40 - we want to be able to connect to it
31:42 - without having to whitelist an ip
31:44 - address so that's what the proxy enables
31:46 - us to do
31:48 - is to still have incoming connections
31:51 - from whatever ip address
31:54 - and have that work
31:56 - for this particular project we need that
31:58 - because
31:59 - the place where i would like to host
32:02 - wordpress from
32:03 - wordpress needs to communicate with this
32:05 - database
32:07 - with that place
32:09 - is going to have variable ip addresses
32:13 - so
32:14 - that's
32:16 - about as high level as i could make it i
32:17 - guess
32:26 - stephen says so lost but i totally have
32:28 - a video to refer to if i ever need this
32:32 - yeah for sure
32:34 - um
32:36 - world says you have to give google your
32:38 - database passwords um well essentially
32:41 - we've we've created a database with
32:44 - google's cloud sql service
32:47 - so
32:48 - google is running our database
32:50 - so obviously they they have our
32:52 - passwords
32:56 - okay cool
32:59 - oh man i went to grab more coffee and my
33:02 - coffee mug is out of coffee
33:08 - i mean like in the grand scheme of
33:10 - things that's no big deal but
33:12 - really that's kind of like the worst
33:14 - when it happens
33:16 - all right so
33:17 - i don't have any more questions right
33:19 - now so i think i'm gonna go right back
33:21 - into another pomodoro session
33:23 - and
33:24 - i think i only want to do one more
33:25 - pomodoro session i have a lot of
33:27 - paperwork and to do
33:29 - from my last trip
33:31 - um
33:34 - for my last conference
33:37 - and somebody's gonna help me with that
33:38 - since i never remember how to do it
33:40 - right
33:40 - and i also have to pick up my son from
33:42 - school so i have to leave the office
33:44 - early
33:45 - so anyway
33:48 - i want to get some stuff done now as
33:50 - quickly as i can
33:53 - alright so
33:57 - we can test our connection
34:02 - by going
34:04 - replacing username with your
34:07 - mysql username okay cool
34:18 - i always like to
34:20 - edit these
34:21 - oops i guess i forgot to copy i always
34:24 - like to edit these in
34:27 - my code editor
34:30 - username
34:34 - ah shoot
34:39 - let's try this um
34:45 - let's try like that and then i want to
34:47 - put
34:52 - so i want to just go into that wordpress
34:54 - database
34:55 - uh so that's how i'm going to
34:57 - modify that just a bit
35:01 - let's see where am i where do i need to
35:03 - run this
35:04 - here
35:09 - no we're in another spot
35:12 - no i don't know
35:34 - all right let me run it from here
35:38 - ah do i not
35:45 - i'm thinking
35:46 - i thought i had this tab open but i have
35:47 - it open on my laptop right next to me so
35:50 - obviously it's not going to work for
35:52 - right now
35:57 - um
36:01 - let me
36:05 - i need ssh into somewhere else
36:10 - that's my sequel
36:26 - uh
36:46 - do
37:12 - all right i'm installing
37:16 - my sequel
37:17 - really quick
37:22 - on my other screen
37:25 - there we go
37:28 - all right let's see if i have it yet
37:32 - oops
37:36 - let me open up a new one
37:40 - no why is it not found still
37:57 - hmm
38:12 - all right that's not cool
38:16 - i just went through the install process
38:18 - for this and now it's not working
38:35 - hmm
38:51 - hmm
39:01 - all right well
39:06 - let me go back
39:37 - service account
39:58 - definitely skipped this part before
40:03 - hmm
40:16 - all right so we have this proxy running
40:40 - hmm
41:29 - hmm
41:44 - maybe
41:53 - there we go
41:54 - my sequel shell
41:59 - okay
42:12 - all right let's see
42:20 - let's see what i can do then now
42:22 - now that we have this started
42:30 - um
43:07 - all right let's try
43:15 - what
43:16 - oh other way
43:23 - all right cool so it looks like we can
43:25 - use this
43:27 - all right let's try it
43:35 - all right what was the unexpected
43:36 - identifier
43:42 - all right let's try it without this then
43:46 - nah still
44:05 - hmm
44:52 - hmm
45:09 - all right let me
45:12 - let me check this
45:14 - which
45:23 - robocop said if everything worked uh
45:25 - without warning that would be too good
45:27 - to be true yeah for sure i mean
45:31 - i expected that we would have some
45:33 - trouble since i've never attempted
45:34 - anything like this before
45:36 - i do wish that it was going slightly
45:39 - better but
45:46 - see
46:00 - hmm
46:11 - okay jeremy miller saying uh p without a
46:15 - pass
46:16 - without a password
46:18 - let's see
46:21 - still
46:24 - interesting
46:32 - i wonder
46:49 - let me try this one
46:58 - so
47:22 - hmm
47:56 - all right
48:05 - this is
48:06 - kind of a dead end right now
48:09 - hmm
48:25 - i need help
48:27 - troubleshooting
48:29 - it's worth a shot here
49:02 - hmm
49:03 - all right i don't think any of those
49:05 - apply
49:11 - mad duchess says i
49:13 - was saying i had it on unix sockets but
49:16 - it was supposed to be
49:17 - tcp yeah i tried the tcp already and it
49:20 - did not work
49:23 - um
49:24 - i mean maybe
49:36 - other than your presence
49:52 - hmm
50:03 - i mean right now i
50:05 - we just keep getting that error
50:07 - like a syntax error
50:10 - let's see
50:12 - all right cool so i just went there in
50:15 - my browser just to see what would happen
50:17 - so at least
50:18 - we're it's registering
50:35 - oh actually you know what i could use
50:37 - let me try this
50:40 - uh
50:41 - i'll
50:42 - let me open this uh sql operations
50:45 - studio
50:47 - and
50:48 - then i'll see if we can
50:52 - can do this so
50:57 - let's do this and we'll do
51:05 - password
51:11 - and
51:15 - see if this works
51:23 - um
51:25 - not looking good
51:29 - i'm not reading anything here
51:32 - nope
51:36 - server was not found they're not
51:38 - accessible
51:40 - okay
51:45 - shoot
51:57 - i mean i could try
52:06 - okay
52:08 - let me try running it like this
52:29 - hmm
52:50 - hmm
52:53 - uh let's see check stack overflow
52:55 - question
52:57 - all
52:58 - right i'm gonna check this on my other
53:00 - screen
53:01 - quickly
53:33 - uh okay cool i did check out that
53:35 - question so let's try it out
53:38 - all right so evidently
53:41 - that is not working
53:45 - let's go to
53:47 - yeah
53:51 - um

54:36 - showing anything
54:38 - no
54:41 - let's break this out so we can see
54:44 - what's going on here
54:58 - okay
55:09 - maybe i should put in
55:14 - that this might have to add
55:16 - oh

56:32 - all right
56:33 - jeremy i'm glad you're i was just
56:35 - reading that in the stack overflow thing
56:37 - uh to do it that way so

56:54 - um
57:08 - and then
57:09 - at
57:22 - zero six

57:34 - no
57:36 - all right let me try it with

59:42 - stephen says this is a long way from me
59:44 - building front-end sites and client
59:45 - dashboards yeah
59:48 - it's a little different than what we're
59:50 - used to
59:53 - it's cool to do new things though
60:00 - i don't know it's fun definitely
60:02 - stretches the brain a bit
60:05 - hmm
60:08 - well we made some progress today right
60:12 - wasn't
60:14 - definitely not mission accomplished yet
60:17 - but
60:19 - made some progress
60:25 - interesting
60:33 - hmm
60:56 - i was just trying to think just trying
60:58 - to see if there are any flags that i
60:59 - could use
61:10 - hmm
61:24 - uh world says
61:26 - are you afraid that google will give you
61:28 - a bill for like 1k or something for
61:31 - using cloud
61:33 - uh
61:34 - no i'm not really afraid of that
61:36 - you don't want to see how much i've been
61:38 - build so far
61:40 - i don't know
61:41 - let's check it out
61:43 - billing
61:49 - um
61:56 - i guess nothing so far
62:11 - hmm
62:39 - so
62:50 - yeah i guess nothing
62:52 - nothing so far
62:56 - that's cool
63:01 - i mean i had
63:02 - i'd actually only plan on having this up
63:04 - just during yesterday's stream but we
63:07 - didn't get done what i wanted to get
63:08 - done so that's why it's still up
63:17 - uh john hanson says would it be worth
63:20 - trying out your commands
63:22 - in the google cloud show
63:25 - sorry
63:26 - within the google cloud platform console
63:30 - well
63:31 - the thing i was i wanted to do was
63:36 - i wanted to be able to connect
63:42 - from from outside the cons because we
63:44 - you know we already were able to connect
63:47 - using the console
63:49 - in google cloud platform
