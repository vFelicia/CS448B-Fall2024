00:00 - In this course, you will learn how to create 
a custom blog website without any code using  
00:04 - WordPress. I'm Beau with freeCodeCamp.org. 
I've created a few popular WordPress courses,  
00:10 - and this one is specifically focused on creating 
a blog. But you can use what you learn in this  
00:16 - video to create other types of websites, including 
business websites, ecommerce sites, portfolios,  
00:22 - and more. You don't need any prior experience to 
follow along, I'll teach you how to use a drag and  
00:28 - drop system that allows for easy and limitless 
customization. So you can build the perfect  
00:33 - website for your needs. And the website will look 
great on both desktop and mobile. Every website  
00:40 - needs a domain name and hosting. The domain is 
what people type into a browser such as freeCodeCamp.org,
00:45 - youtube.com, or wikipedia.org. Hosting 
is where the files for your website are actually  
00:51 - stored. We'll be getting both the domain name and 
hostinger.com. But you can still follow  
00:57 - along if you use a different hosting provider, 
just use the timestamps in the description to skip  
01:03 - to what you want to learn. Hosting are provided 
a grant that made this course possible. But I  
01:08 - had already used hosting or personally in the past 
and had a good experience hosting or is optimized  
01:14 - for WordPress sites and has a 99.9%. uptime 
guarantee. They also give you a free domain and  
01:20 - free SSL. So we can just go here, get click Get 
Started. And then you can decide whether you're  
01:27 - going to create a brand new website or transfer an 
existing website. Well, we're creating a brand new  
01:31 - website. And you can you don't have to go through 
all this. But we are doing a WordPress here.  
01:38 - And I'm just going to go through here and it'll 
tell you what kind of package we want to do. So  
01:47 - we can just skip this for now, it because this is 
actually an upgrade, but we don't want to upgrade.  
01:53 - So I'll just go to skip here. And then it's going 
to recommend the Premium shared hosting plan. So  
02:00 - you can actually go and just select your plan 
manually. But this will help you figure out the  
02:05 - exact plan you want. You can see right here, you 
can actually host 100 different websites on this  
02:10 - plan, and you get a good amount of storage and 
you get unlimited bandwidth. So that's pretty  
02:15 - good. You includes a free domain, and an SSL 
will make it so you have a secure website. So  
02:22 - this is a good option. So I'm just going to select 
that. And then it's going to show where you can  
02:29 - actually upgrade if you want or you can choose 
a different amount of months. And you can see,  
02:35 - depending on how many months you buy, the time 
is is how much it's going to renew for. So you  
02:40 - can see this one renews at 6.99, 7.99, 8.99 or 11.99 a 
month. So just pick whatever one you think is  
02:48 - going to work best for you. If you're just testing 
it out, you could just do a one month plan. Or if  
02:54 - you know you're going to have a website long term, 
you can do one of these other plans. And then  
02:59 - after you get all this set up, you can go through 
just to create the account, and you can select  
03:05 - your payment, and then you can submit it. So 
I'm not actually going to type in everything.  
03:10 - But it's pretty straightforward if you're going 
to create your own account for the first time.  
03:15 - So after you get logged in, and possibly as 
part of creating your account, you're going  
03:21 - to want to get your domain. So if you're done 
creating your account and you haven't gotten  
03:26 - a domain through that process yet, we can just 
click on claim domain right in the main menu.  
03:32 - Now here is your you're going to have to have 
a domain name that's never been used before. It  
03:39 - could take you a few tries to find one that's not 
already taken. But I'm gonna go with B e a u with  
03:46 - the dashes that's my name oh, but my name doesn't 
have dashes but ODOT now let's check availability.  
03:52 - And I already tested this so I knew I 
knew it work and I will claim domain.  
04:00 - Okay, now he's had to set up 
this domain registration details
04:07 - and we'll just finish filling this out.  
04:12 - Okay, the domain is registered. Okay, 
now add the website to the hosting plan.  
04:20 - And I already had this hosting plan registered 
for this other website. So select that one
04:30 - website connected successfully. Now we'll show 
you how to set up an email account on your domain  
04:38 - through hosting her. So I'm under hosting her 
home tab. After I'm logged in, and I'm going to  
04:43 - just click emails. And now I'm going to the so I 
already set up this from before but now I'm gonna  
04:50 - set the email on the domain we just created. So 
I'm just gonna click there and then create email  
04:55 - account and then I'm just going to I'm typing it 
automatically filled in something, but I can type  
05:03 - in anything I want. So I'm going to put Bo and 
then I'm just going to type in a password here.  
05:09 - And then create. Okay, so now people can email 
me at Beau at B dash E dash a dash u.net. And  
05:18 - then I can access the email by still being 
on this email tab here and going to webmail.  
05:25 - And then I'll just sign in here. And there 
are no messages. But I can always compose a  
05:33 - new message here. And then I'll receive 
messages if someone sends me a message.  
05:38 - And now let's go over how to set up SSL for the 
website. So I'm going to go to the SSL tab on  
05:44 - this hosting or dashboard. And SSL is important, 
it makes sure all data coming and going from your  
05:51 - website is secure. And nobody's going to be able 
to, there won't be any hackers or anybody that  
05:58 - can see what's going on with the website. If 
someone submits information, it will be secure,  
06:02 - nobody will be able to see what that information 
is. So I'm just going to click the Install SSL  
06:07 - button. And then I'm going to select the website 
and just click Install SSL. And the great thing is  
06:13 - that it's it's free, it's completely included 
within hosting or within the plan. And now I  
06:19 - should have SSL but I'm gonna have to actually 
do this drop down menu to go to the boat.net  
06:24 - to see the one that we just added. And you can see 
it's installing it says it may take up to an hour.  
06:30 - But then after that, we can go to the website 
instead of going to http colon slash slash vote  
06:36 - on that it will be HTTP s colon slash slash vote 
on net because it has SSL. It's the S stands for  
06:43 - secure. I'll go back to the dashboard. Now I want 
to get WordPress installed on the website. Many  
06:50 - different website hosting services allow you to 
easily install WordPress on the website. So the  
06:57 - exact method could be different if you're not 
using hosting or, but it should be relatively  
07:02 - similar. So I'm just going to scroll down on 
this page here. And I'm going to click WordPress.  
07:09 - And then I'm going to install WordPress. And I'll 
fill this out to finish setting up. So let's call  
07:18 - it my website for now. And anything here can be 
changed later. And then I'll put in the password.  
07:28 - And then I'll just use these default 
settings here and click Install.  
07:36 - We're on the hosting or dashboard. We want 
to go to the WordPress dashboard. So we can  
07:42 - start creating our WordPress website. So just 
click on Edit website. If you're using something  
07:48 - besides say the WordPress there'll be something 
similar to get into the WordPress dashboard.  
07:54 - Another way you can always access your WordPress 
dashboard. If you look in the URL bar here,  
08:00 - we have the URL name. And then it's slash WP dash 
admin. You can always go to slash WP dash admin to  
08:08 - get to your WordPress dashboard. Okay, it zoomed 
in a little bit on this, and we're just gonna look  
08:14 - at some of the things on the menu over here. These 
are all things that are important when creating a  
08:19 - WordPress page. We have our posts when we're going 
to create a new post, but you're likely going to  
08:24 - be creating a new page, like the about us page 
contact page and stuff like that. And you can also  
08:31 - change your appearance. And there's just a bunch 
of other sections here, many of which we'll be  
08:36 - going over in more detail later in this tutorial. 
But first of all, let's go over to users. And you  
08:43 - just want to make sure that you have a a password, 
we just want to make sure that the password is  
08:49 - the password we chose. Now, depending on how you 
installed WordPress, you may not have created a  
08:55 - password. And depending on what hosting provider 
you use, and use meant when it may maybe verify  
09:01 - that you're not going to have a default password. 
So I'm just going to type in a password here.  
09:08 - And then I'm going to do update profile. Okay, 
now we're going to go to the plugins tab.  
09:17 - Before we deal with the plugins, let's 
just get rid of some of these tabs.  
09:20 - I'm going to click x here, we don't 
need this. I guess they're not tabs,  
09:25 - they're just information boxes. And to get rid of 
this one we're going to go through and actually  
09:30 - delete some of the extra plugins here we don't 
a lot of these plugins we don't actually need  
09:40 - so I've selected all the extra plugins and I 
don't need this one either. And I'm going to go to  
09:48 - first I'll do deactivate and then I have to 
select them again, and I'm gonna go to Delete  
10:00 - And don't worry if you accidentally 
delete a plugin that you actually need,  
10:04 - because it's really easy to reinstall 
them. So I'm gonna go to Delete.  
10:14 - Okay, and now we've deleted all the plugins we 
don't need. And you can see we no longer have the  
10:20 - extra information box up here that was associated 
with a particular plugin. Now, no matter what type  
10:25 - of website you're trying to make, you're probably 
going to want to install a theme. And that's what  
10:32 - we're going to do themes make it way easier to 
create the website that you want to create. And  
10:39 - a lot of themes come with various templates. So 
one theme can have multiple templates. And each  
10:44 - template can be for a different types of type of 
website. Now, what you're going to want to do is  
10:50 - go to add new, and there's tons of different types 
of different themes that you can install. One of  
10:57 - the most popular ones is Astra, so just go up here 
and search for Astra and Astra comes with a lot of  
11:06 - different templates you can use. So it's basically 
one theme that has one way of kind of modifying  
11:13 - and editing it. But there's all these templates 
for different types of websites, including blogs,  
11:19 - we're creating a tech blog. And let me show you 
how we can get that set up with Astra, pretty much  
11:25 - everything I'm going to teach you will work with 
will apply to any theme that you choose. So if you  
11:31 - choose a different theme, it's still you're still 
going to be able to do most of the things that I'm  
11:37 - showing you. So I'm going to go with Astra and 
I already have it installed, so you're going to  
11:42 - have to install it, and then you're going to 
have to activate it, I'm just going to click  
11:47 - Activate here. And then once it's activated, 
we can just go to get started. But you can see  
11:53 - right here has come to dozens of reviews, thorough 
templates. So that's what we're going to be using.
11:58 - So I'll click Get Started. And then we can scroll 
down, we don't need to watch the video here,  
12:07 - build your website now. And then it's going to 
say select your page builder. A page builder is  
12:13 - just something that you can use to create your 
page to modify it and to make changes on it. So  
12:19 - block editor, this is the default editor that 
comes with WordPress. And Elementor and beaver  
12:25 - builder are third party editors, but they're both 
very popular. And if we click, if we choose one of  
12:32 - these, we can still also use this one because it's 
still built into WordPress. So I'm gonna go with  
12:36 - Elementor. That's one of the most popular ones. 
And that's going to make it even easier to editor  
12:42 - website and making it make it look exactly how we 
want it to look. And so pretty much all of these  
12:49 - themes, all these templates off, they all 
often have free versions and paid versions,  
12:55 - they're trying to make some money, so so they're 
gonna give you the free version to get to you to  
13:00 - install it. But then you may see a paid version 
that you want to upgrade. But in this course,  
13:04 - we're only using free versions. And you can 
do quite a bit with free versions. So these  
13:10 - are all these templates that you can choose 
from. And you can see if it says premium,  
13:14 - that's obviously one of the paid ones. But there's 
quite a few of the free versions. So you can see,  
13:18 - these are all different ones. And what you want 
to do is find something that looks close to what  
13:24 - you want, or somewhat similar. And you can 
do a considerable amount of customizing. So  
13:31 - it doesn't have to look exactly like what you 
want. But find one that's kind of the closest,  
13:36 - and then you can go through and basically 
customize every single part of it. So it fits it  
13:41 - perfectly fits what you're trying to do with your 
website. Since we're going to go with a distance  
13:47 - recruiting a tech blog, I'm going to use this 
creative blog. So I'm gonna just click on here,  
13:52 - and then we can upload a logo, but it look 
good, it says don't have a logo, no problem,  
13:58 - you can upload it later. So that's true for in 
this initial customization that we're going to do  
14:04 - be doing everything you can do later. So you don't 
have to do it. Now you can always change things,  
14:08 - anything that you do, you can always change back. 
So I'll skip and continue. And then we can change  
14:13 - the color. So see, whenever we click that we 
can see different things on the page. Turn,  
14:17 - if we go down here, we can see more, more things 
changing colors. You can see if we go down here,  
14:24 - see, different things are going to change color. 
So I kind of like this green one. So we're  
14:29 - gonna go with that one. And then we can choose 
what font we want. And if we go back up here,  
14:34 - we can kind of see the heading, I'm gonna go with 
this one, I kind of like the different small,  
14:40 - like the curve saris that are on the 
letters there. So we're gonna continue  
14:44 - and then we can talk a little bit about yourself, 
but I don't want to I'm not going to tell anything  
14:49 - about myself. And so we can choose a way I 
meant to not agree to receive anything. And  
14:55 - so you can basically leave all these checked. 
I'm not going to share sensitive data but We'll  
15:00 - import all these things that are going to help 
the theme work. So submit and build my website.  
15:07 - Okay, now we just have to wait. And you can see it 
says installing require theme plugins and forms.  
15:13 - So we could install the themes and the forums, 
individual individually. But this is we're  
15:19 - just going to do it all for us. So to do all the 
ones that we need to, to make our template work,  
15:25 - congratulations, our website is ready. 
So I'm gonna go to view your website.  
15:30 - And now we can see what the website looks like. 
This is basically the default website, we see that  
15:35 - we have the title of the logo up here. And there's 
these this menu here, we can do a search, and we  
15:42 - can subscribe. And so if we scroll down here, we 
can see we can subscribe to a newsletter. There's  
15:48 - basically an ad here, which is just a sample ad, 
which we're definitely going to remove. And so  
15:56 - we have different categories of the articles that 
are that are on this website, and some podcasts.  
16:02 - Now these aren't any won't play anything, because 
this is just kind of an example of what it could  
16:07 - look like if you have podcasts. And then we have 
this bottom menu here and some social links, and  
16:12 - you can install or subscribed on here. And then 
if we go here, these are all different categories  
16:17 - of articles, so articles about film articles 
about advertising, articles about photography.  
16:22 - So if I scroll down, we see that's one article. 
And then here's another article. So each article  
16:27 - has a picture headline. And I can click into 
that. And then we can read the full article.  
16:33 - And this is just dummy text, lorem ipsum, it's not 
going to so this is just like an example of what  
16:39 - an article would look like. And then there's 
related posts, and you can leave a comment.  
16:46 - So we're going to focus on building a blog. 
But like I said, everything that we're doing  
16:52 - will apply to pretty much any type of website 
you're creating. So if you want to create a  
16:58 - Sophina, if you want to create a business page, 
or a portfolio page, or any type of website,  
17:04 - you'll be able to follow along and apply a lot 
of these same concepts to any type of website.  
17:10 - So if I go to full screen mode, we can see that 
when we're on the website, it just says my website  
17:18 - right here, well, we want to say something 
different. So that's the first thing we're  
17:23 - going to customize. We're going to see how to 
customize a bunch of stuff. But the first thing  
17:27 - is just going to be the title up here. Oh yeah, I 
don't need this tab open. This is the tab where it  
17:32 - installed everything. So I'll close that. So let 
me go back to WordPress. And we'll fullscreen that  
17:38 - again, I'll go to settings, general settings. 
And then here is where we can change the site  
17:44 - title and tagline. And whenever you install 
templates, every once in a while it's going to  
17:50 - pop up different things like this, we can just 
close that. So I'm gonna call this the site  
17:55 - title. This is a tech blog. So we're gonna 
call it tech tuba. And then for the tag line  
18:01 - will say all the best tech news, I could just 
select it because I had already typed that in  
18:05 - earlier. So then you can also change all these 
other things. You never want to change the URL,  
18:11 - but you can change the administration 
email, you can change the site language,  
18:14 - timezone date format. So these are all things 
you can customize. I'll just click save changes,  
18:20 - we're just going to change the title. 
And so now if I open up the website  
18:28 - and then we can see right here, tech 
tuba, all the best tech news. Okay,  
18:33 - before we start customizing this further, I'm 
gonna go back over to WordPress. And I'm gonna  
18:37 - go over to the plugins. So I talked to you about 
how some plugins were installed, automatically.  
18:43 - You can see these blue rows here are the ones that 
are just installed with Elementor. That's to help  
18:51 - us edit the page and a more easily an easy way 
starter templates that gives us access to all the  
18:56 - different starter sites. And we chose we chose one 
from their web forms, this is going to make it so  
19:03 - we can easily get our contact form to work. Okay, 
so let's go back to our page. So we already looked  
19:11 - at all these different things. So now we're going 
to start actually customizing it. So there's a few  
19:16 - different ways you can start customizing. So we're 
first going to click on Customize right here.  
19:21 - First of all, you can see it says more options 
available and Astra pro so like I said, there's  
19:25 - a few different things where they try to upsell 
you. But we don't need any of those extra options,  
19:30 - you get quite a bit of options just in the free 
version. So you can change the theme, which we're  
19:36 - not going to do. But if we go to global and we 
go to colors, this is where we can change the  
19:41 - colors we did when we were setting up the theme 
we chose some colors, but if you want to make some  
19:46 - changes, you can do it here. Like for instance 
I can for global one, I can change to red,  
19:53 - and you can see right here that button change to 
red. And then if you ever say oh Don't want that.  
20:01 - And instead of clicking publish publish is going 
to save what you just chose, I can just hit X,  
20:08 - and then it's going to say the changes will be 
lost. So I'm going to make those changes last. And  
20:13 - now it goes back to green. Now I'm gonna go back 
to customize, this will go back over to there.  
20:18 - And to global, we can also change the typography. 
So this will change what the different what kind  
20:23 - of fonts we're using. And then you can change 
the fonts for different elements on the page,  
20:28 - like different headings, and there's just 
a bunch of different things that we can  
20:34 - change. So we can change the layout, we can 
change, what buttons are going to look like,  
20:40 - like it can make it, so it's the buttons 
that are going to be kind of white like that,  
20:45 - I can change some padding border width of the 
buttons, like, like, maybe I want to have 10  
20:55 - for the border with. So you can see these buttons 
just got a lot bigger, because the width of around  
21:00 - the border got bigger. But I'm gonna change 
that back to zero. And then I'll go back here.
21:06 - We can also change the header, breadcrumb blog, 
we're gonna be going through some of these later.  
21:14 - But one thing I want to focus on right now is the 
site identity. This is where you can actually add  
21:20 - a, an icon that's going to appear in the URL bar. 
And then you can also add a logo. So right now  
21:27 - there's the this logo, the creative room ad. And 
you can see we have the normal logo and the retina  
21:35 - logo. The difference is the type of screen. So 
retina screens are generally generally screens  
21:41 - that have more pixels per inch, so you need a 
higher resolution logo. Now you can use the same  
21:47 - logo for both. But also you have the option to 
put a higher resolution logo for the retina logo.  
21:54 - And you can see while we're on this page, you 
can see this other menu has appeared down here.  
21:59 - And it's basically showing all the different the 
different pieces of content that are above the  
22:06 - main content. So we have this is the main content 
here. But this is showing at the very top we have  
22:12 - the site title and logo which are right here. 
And then this line right here is this line,  
22:16 - where we have the primary menu, which it does, it 
is putting the menu down to the second line here,  
22:22 - which will I'll show you how to fix that later. 
And then we also have the search in the button.  
22:26 - That's what we have right there. And then there's 
there's nothing in this third, we can add. So if  
22:32 - we wanted to add something in there, like an 
additional menu or something that was at the  
22:37 - top of every page, we could, but right now let's 
do the logo. Now there's a lot of websites out  
22:42 - there that can help you create a logo for free. 
And then there's different websites out there  
22:47 - where you can hire people to create logos, such 
as Fiverr. But I just went ahead and created a  
22:53 - logo myself. So I'm going to change the logo. And 
then I can either drop files or select the file.  
23:00 - So I'm just going to drop this file here. And we 
just uploaded the logo. And then for the alt text.  
23:09 - Now the alt text is helpful for Well, for one, 
if people can't see the image, then they can,  
23:16 - or they're able to read the alt text. And 
also if the image doesn't load correctly,  
23:22 - it will it will be able to show the alt text 
so it's good to have an alt texts for all your  
23:27 - images. So I'll do tech tubuh logo, and then 
I will select OK. Oh, now I can I can crop it,  
23:39 - I'm going to crop it. So it just uses the entire 
image and then click crop image. Or I guess it  
23:45 - could have clicked skip cropping since I'm not 
cropping. And so I'm going to have to upload  
23:51 - it in two spots. I'm gonna have to upload it 
here. And then I'm just going to upload the  
23:55 - same one for the retina logo. So there and choose 
Image. Okay, so now it shows tech two, but now  
24:07 - it's a little bigger than I was wanting it to 
be. So let's see how we can change the size of  
24:14 - the logo. So to change the size of the logo, I 
can go down here, and then we can set the logo  
24:23 - width. We can also set a few different things 
like the site title and the tagline by line go  
24:31 - to the width. And I'm going to just set a specific 
width. So before if you don't have anything here,  
24:40 - it's just going to basically be the default. 
So if I just delete that, or if I like no yes,  
24:49 - put zero if you put zero it will put the default 
size but I am going to make it smaller. So I'm  
24:57 - going to set a specific size now out this. So some 
of the design decisions I'm creating I'm doing  
25:04 - may not look the best, but you can kind of keep 
tweaking things until things look exactly how you  
25:11 - want it to look. So I've already noticed that we 
have the blue here, so it'd be kind of nice, maybe  
25:16 - it's a buttons, what were the same shade of blue, 
which we can do already, so yet how to change  
25:21 - that color. For now, though, we'll just we'll 
just move on to the next part of our website.  
25:26 - So now I'm going to go back. And for now I'm 
going to, I'm not going to do anything more,  
25:32 - we're gonna actually come back to some of these 
later, if you want to go through and just check  
25:36 - them out yourself, you can't wait, we're gonna 
come back to some of these later. So right now,  
25:39 - I'm just going to click the Publish button. And 
then now that's published, I can hit the X here.  
25:46 - Okay, and, you know, now that I'm seeing it, yeah, 
I am gonna go and change the color. So it matches  
25:53 - that the logo that we just got. So we'll go 
back to customize. And then global colors,  
26:03 - I'll just change these greens, the blues, so I'm 
gonna change that this too. And if I can basically  
26:12 - get something kind of close to what's in the 
image in the logo that we developed. So let's do  
26:22 - that's a good color for that line. And then 
here, we're going to do a darker blue for that.  
26:29 - Okay, so you can see we have dark blue, and light 
blue. Okay, looks good. And so we'll publish that.  
26:40 - Okay, so now I'm gonna go and 
continue to make some changes here.  
26:47 - So let's start customizing this page will first 
work on customizing this homepage. And then we'll  
26:53 - look about how to customize the other sections 
of the page, including the blog entries. First,  
27:00 - we're going to go to edit with Elementor. If we 
go to Edit page, we'll use the WordPress built  
27:05 - in editor. But Elementor makes some things 
a little easier when you're editing. So I'm  
27:10 - gonna click edit with Elementor. And then we got 
this open. And you can see we have the Elementor  
27:16 - side panel. And then we have the navigator over 
here, I'm going to pull this to the side and  
27:21 - make the navigator go all the way to the side. 
And we can still kind of scroll back and forth  
27:26 - to see the whole page. And the cool thing about 
the Navigator. I'll talk about that before I go  
27:32 - to this menu over here, the navigator is going to 
show all the elements in the page. So we have if  
27:38 - we just open these drop down menus, we have 
this heading, which is this one right here,  
27:43 - the image box, which is right here, and then we 
have a button, we get the see when we click on it,  
27:50 - it will kind of highlight it. So that image 
is this image down here. And then we have  
27:53 - another column, which is this image right here. So 
basically, in this section, there are two columns,  
28:00 - the left column and the right column. And then we 
can scroll down here. And actually, if I zoom out  
28:07 - a little bit here, we'll be able to see a little 
more on the page at once. So we come down and look  
28:13 - at the next section. And the next section just has 
one column, it has this image box. And then it has  
28:20 - this form. And then we have the final section, 
which just has one column, which has image,  
28:27 - which is this ad here, the heading but so so I'm 
not gonna go through the rest of them. But you can  
28:32 - kind of see, you can see how it can make it easier 
to select one specific part of your page. And you  
28:39 - can see as we move our mouse around it, we 
can each element or each section on the page  
28:45 - will have this little edit button. So what I'm 
gonna do for now is just close this navigator,  
28:50 - we're not going to use a navigator, and then 
close it. So it makes things easier to see on  
28:55 - the page. So let's start doing some editing to 
the page. So I'm going to click right into here,  
29:02 - I can click if I click this edit button, it will 
bring up our Edit section over here. And you can  
29:09 - see this just happens to be an image box and the 
image. So you can have a text box or an image box.  
29:16 - So this image box just happens to not have an 
image with it. But it does have a title and a  
29:23 - description. So I can actually change that I can 
actually change it right on the page like this  
29:29 - best tech news, or I can I can 
change it right over here. I can say  
29:39 - your one stop page for all the latest tech 
news. And so we can go through and basically  
29:52 - click each element and make some changes. So this 
read article will let me go to this read article  
29:59 - button. So If we go to the button, we can, we 
can change the text of the button, I can say,  
30:05 - go to stories. So it will go to specific 
stories, we can change that the type of button,  
30:15 - which is this is just going to basically be 
different colors of the buttons, you can see.
30:23 - Well, let's go back to the default. But 
specifically, I'm going to look at the  
30:27 - link right now, this button doesn't actually do 
anything. If you have a link, and it just has the  
30:34 - this pound sign or hash mark hash tag here, that 
just means it's an empty link. It's a link that  
30:40 - doesn't go anywhere, but we want to go somewhere. 
So what I'm going to do is make it go to the film  
30:48 - page. And so if I hover over the film page, you 
can see the bottom left hand corner of the screen,  
30:54 - you can see the URL for the film page. 
And we're going to make it say that URL,  
30:59 - or I can just go to copy link address, and then 
I can just put the link right here. So now when  
31:06 - we click the Go to stories page, it will go 
directly to this category. And we can also do  
31:13 - other things like we can change the alignment of 
the button, we can change the size of the button,  
31:19 - we can change the spacing. And then you can 
also open up these link options. And you can  
31:26 - choose is this button going to open up this link 
and open up into a new window, there's a bunch  
31:32 - of up options you can do for a button. Now let's 
go over here, I'm going to go over to this image  
31:38 - right here. And I'm going to change this image. 
So if I go to choose image. Now for some reason,  
31:44 - these tabs aren't showing this. So if I hover you 
can see here's where you upload a file, or here  
31:50 - it says free images, I'm not quite sure hopefully 
on your, you're just not being hidden like that.  
31:56 - But if I got a free images, we can see this is 
powered by Pixabay. Now Pixabay is just a way is  
32:03 - a is a website where you can get free royalty free 
images. So I'm going to search for technology. And  
32:11 - then I'm actually going to change the orientation 
to do a vertical orientation, because I think  
32:17 - that will work better in that spot. I guess 
it's not having any for vertical orientation.  
32:25 - Okay, so now if I just search for Tech, 
we can get this vertical orientation.  
32:32 - And I like this one, because it has a lot of 
technology in it. It's really about broadcasting.  
32:38 - Now you can go through and find the images 
in another place and upload it. But for now,  
32:44 - I'm just gonna throw in this image right here. 
And insert media. Okay, so now we have this,  
32:55 - this image that we put into our website. And we 
can also change other things like right here,  
33:00 - this is also an image right here, I'm gonna 
keep it here, we'll just go down and see  
33:06 - that subscribe to our newsletter. And I can go 
through and change this and say, you will get  
33:14 - the best articles to your inbox. And then you can 
see where you can put in your email address and  
33:21 - subscribe. And later, we'll get we'll also show 
you how to set this up so it works even better. So  
33:28 - we're going to go we're going to show how to use 
this subscribe form and the contact form. So I'll  
33:34 - show you that later. Now we don't want to have 
ads on our page. So I'm going to show you how to  
33:38 - just remove this section completely. So what I'm 
going to do to delete the section, I could click  
33:44 - click this X button, but that's going to click 
delete this whole section, including the podcast,  
33:51 - the categories, and this ad here. So to delete 
just this ADD, basically I'm gonna select,  
33:58 - I'm gonna right click, and I'm gonna go to delete, 
and just deletes that section. So when we I want  
34:04 - to keep the popular category section, but this 
is just a tech blog, we don't have podcasts. So  
34:10 - I'm gonna delete this podcast section also. So I'm 
going to right click, go to Delete. And then here,  
34:17 - I can actually just hit this X button, it's 
going to delete that whole section. So we have  
34:23 - the four different categories. So let's update our 
categories. These are the categories we're going  
34:29 - to have, we're going to have a category called 
news. We're gonna have a category called reviews.  
34:40 - And then we're going to have a category called 
gaming. And then we're going to have a category  
34:48 - called Software. Okay, now we can if we wanted to, 
we can actually right click and delete just one  
34:55 - of these buttons or one of these categories 
or we could even add new code categories,  
35:00 - if we want to add a new one, I could actually 
right click on this and go to duplicate. And  
35:06 - so now there's a five here instead of four, but 
I'm gonna just delete that because we only want  
35:11 - the four here. And then if I can delete another 
one to go to three. So now we have these, these  
35:17 - four different categories. And let's just choose 
new images. So for news, I'm going to go to Edit,  
35:23 - I did a right click Edit Column. In the in 
style, this is where I can change the image.  
35:31 - So I'm going to click Choose Image, I'm just going 
to basically choose some images that are already  
35:35 - in there to make that faster for reviews, I've 
got to choose image, and we'll use this image.  
35:43 - And then for reviews, I got to edit column again 
style, then I'll use this for the reviews. And  
35:50 - then for gaming, I am going to go to style. 
And then we could go to the free images and  
35:56 - select one. But to make it quick, I'm just 
going to select an image that's already on  
36:00 - here. So this person is not quite playing game, 
but we're just going to use that one. And then  
36:06 - I'll just choose another one really quick for 
software. And we'll do that one. So now we've kind  
36:14 - of we've learned how to edit this. But let's see 
how we can add a new column. So what if we want  
36:19 - something after the categories what if we want 
something else? Well, there's a few different ways  
36:24 - to do it. If we want to in between, we can press 
this plus button, but I'm but if we want this at  
36:31 - the end, it's already it's always going to show 
you so always going to have one at the end that  
36:34 - you can add. So I can click this. And then we can 
select the structure, you can see these there's  
36:39 - different column layouts we can choose. And so 
I'll click that. So now we're going to have,  
36:45 - we can see right here, so we have the small column 
here in the larger column here, by click here.  
36:50 - Now it's going to show us all these different 
elements we can add. So we may want to have a  
36:56 - heading. So I can drag this heading here. And then 
we can edit the Kaeding, we can change the size,  
37:03 - we can change the style, we can also go back to 
the elements here, then I can add some text right  
37:11 - underneath here. So we can have heading here. 
And it's also cool how easy it is to add a video,  
37:16 - we can click the plus button here, if you don't 
already have the elements section up here. And I  
37:21 - can bring in a video. And once you bring in the 
video, then we can just put in a specific URL.  
37:29 - So I'm just gonna paste in the URL here. And so 
this is a good tech related video how to build a  
37:36 - Hackintosh. And you can even specify the start 
time in time whether you want to autoplay No,  
37:40 - because everyone hates auto playing. And then 
there's a bunch of other options that you can,  
37:44 - you can choose player controls, if you want, 
we'll turn off the controls. So there's a bunch  
37:51 - of things you can do, we want to turn on privacy 
mode, that's something you probably want to do,  
37:56 - because then it's not going to attract people. 
And so then when you go to your website,  
38:02 - people can have this video here. So there's a 
bunch of different things you can, you can edit,  
38:07 - you can kind of go around and change different 
things. But let's go over to I want to show you  
38:13 - how to update these blog sections or the article 
sections. Were later we're going to talk about how  
38:21 - to update all this stuff down here. So we have 
different choices. We have film, advertising,  
38:26 - photography, digital, and we got rid of podcasts. 
So let's make it so this is all updated. If we  
38:32 - click here, you'll notice that if see if I move 
my mouse around, you can see wherever my mouse is,  
38:37 - there's a blue box around, but there's no blue box 
around over here. Because this menu, we have to  
38:43 - edit in a separate spot of, of WordPress, we don't 
we don't edit this menu through Elementor. So,  
38:51 - first of all, let's take a note of the things 
news reviews gaming software, that's what we're  
38:55 - going to change this menu to. And what I'm going 
to do is click Update to save all the changes  
39:00 - we had from before. Now we're gonna go out of 
Elementor I'm gonna click this hamburger menu  
39:05 - and then I'm just gonna go to View Page. Okay, so 
we can see the page with all the updates we made.  
39:10 - You can see this gets a little, maybe too long, 
we can go up. So that's something we can actually  
39:15 - edit. So this image doesn't go down so far. 
But we can see it has these changes. We've have  
39:23 - this whole new section here. So let's see how to 
update that menu. We're gonna have to go back into  
39:29 - the WordPress dashboard. So I'm gonna hover over 
Appearance, and then I am going to go to menus.  
39:40 - And here is where I'm going to update that 
top menu. You can see all these different  
39:44 - options. So we're not going to have 
podcast, so I'm just going to click this
39:53 - and go to the drop down menu and then remove 
and then I'm also going to get rid of this one  
40:00 - Because we really only want four items, and 
then now we have to rename. So to rename these,  
40:07 - we're actually going to change the categories. 
So first of all, I'm going to save that,  
40:13 - and it says menu has been updated. And 
then let's change the category names.  
40:19 - So it changed the category names, we'll go to 
posts. So these are all default posts that are  
40:27 - just kind of brought in based on our theme. 
And then we go to categories. So here's all  
40:33 - the categories, and this is the one we deleted. 
So I'm gonna delete that one digital. And now  
40:40 - I'm gonna change the name of these other four. 
So advertising, I'm gonna change to news. And  
40:46 - then the slug, this is what's going to be in the 
URL I select to update it. So it will go into the  
40:53 - URL, I'll show you how to do that later. So 
this is what the URL is going to look like.  
40:58 - And then we'll update that, go to categories. And 
then we can go to the next one, which will be the  
41:05 - design one. Oh, and we can do with a quick edit 
to make it a little quicker. And we'll do reviews,
41:11 - reviews. And then the film, 
this is going to be gaming
41:25 - and then software. So most types of blogs, you're 
going to have different categories. And so this  
41:35 - is how you update them. So if we go back to our 
our website, and I'm just going to refresh here,  
41:43 - we can see it automatically updated these here. 
So review reviews, gaming, new software. So let's  
41:50 - see how we can put that in a different order. 
So we want those to be in the same order as  
41:55 - our categories down here. So what I'm doing is, 
basically, I have these two tabs over here. So  
42:01 - I'm using shortcut keys to switch between them. So 
I'm going to go back over here. And then I can go  
42:06 - back to Appearance and Menus. And now I can move 
these around. So the first thing is going to be  
42:12 - news reviews, gaming software. And after moving 
around, I can save that. And if I go back over  
42:20 - here and refresh, news reviews gaming software. 
So now yeah, now we have the different categories.  
42:26 - So these different articles are in these 
categories. These are all the sample articles.  
42:36 - So now that we learn how to make different blog 
post categories, let's see how to customize what  
42:42 - these these pages look like. So this page is the 
page that's going to show a little bit of each  
42:47 - article. And then when you click into the article, 
that's where it's going to show the full article.  
42:53 - So there's two different things that we need to 
customize, you can see that there's no edit with  
42:58 - Elementor. Because when we're on editing this 
page, we have to do it a little differently. So  
43:02 - I'm gonna click customize, and then go to blog. 
And so there's two things here, the blog archive,  
43:12 - which is basically this page here. And then we 
also have the single post, which is when you  
43:18 - click into the posts, so the blog archive, I can 
change what this is going to look like. So like  
43:24 - for instance, if I click here, now, it's going 
to basically make it a little smaller, and put  
43:32 - the title here. So we can kind of just experiment 
with clicking some of these different layouts.  
43:43 - So here before, we didn't have a sidebar, 
but here we have a sidebar, where we can,  
43:49 - if we want a sidebar with some extra information, 
we can add that. So we have a search here  
43:54 - where we can search for blog posts, that are 
Recent Posts, Recent Comments, the archives,  
44:00 - and I kind of like that I want people to 
be let's see, when they go to this page,  
44:04 - the I want them to be able to search for things. 
And I want them to be able to look see the recent  
44:10 - posts. And we can also switch what side of the 
side that's on. So if we keep scrolling down here,  
44:17 - we can do different things like we can turn on 
or off the featured image. So we want the image  
44:23 - to show up. Do we want the title and metadata to 
show up? Do we want the my comments so right now,  
44:30 - none of these have comments. But if I take this 
off, you can even leave a comment. And then we  
44:37 - can turn on or off the category. So right now see 
it says the keywords the comments, the category  
44:43 - and the author. So those are the things we can 
turn off or on we can turn on the publish date.  
44:49 - And so there's just a bunch of things you can do 
to change what your blog is going to look like.  
44:57 - And you can even change the CIO CEO says recent 
Post, if I click this little edit button here,  
45:02 - it's going to first of all, I'm just gonna click 
got it, and that's gonna come into here. And now  
45:08 - I can change what this is going to look 
like. So instead of saying recent posts,  
45:13 - I can say maybe recent articles. Now it's gonna 
say recent articles. And then I can even, maybe,  
45:21 - if I highlight that I can make it bold. I 
guess that's not doing anything, but I can  
45:26 - make it italic, italic. And there's all sorts of 
things you can change. And that can change this  
45:34 - stuff here, like maybe I don't want the recent 
comments. So let's say if I, if I don't want this,  
45:39 - I can, if I don't want the recent comments, I 
can click on these three little blocks here,  
45:43 - these three little dots. And I can say remove 
group. And what if I want the archives above,  
45:52 - I can click here and I can move the archives 
above, or it can with archives below. And you  
45:57 - can just play around with this and get it 
to look exactly how you want it to look.  
46:04 - So I'm now I'm going to go into the 
actual blog post. So if I go into here,  
46:14 - and now now we want to edit this blog post, so I'm 
going to blog and single post. So now there's a  
46:21 - lot of other things we can do once we in here, do 
we want to use the box layout, full width layout,  
46:27 - so you can kind of try different things 
about what exact what the layout you want,  
46:34 - for each individual blog post, you can change 
the custom with the content wet. And then you  
46:42 - can check check whether it's going to show the 
featured image basically all the same information  
46:46 - before you can put on here. And we can change 
how many related posts for any space right now  
46:53 - there's only one But we can say how many related 
posts, we want to show up right here. Okay,  
47:00 - now I'm going to save the changes that 
I made to that. So I'll hit publish.  
47:07 - So now that we know how to modify this and change 
what the blog looks like, how do you actually add  
47:14 - new blog entries? Well, it's simple. So I'm 
going to hit X here. And I'm going to go back  
47:20 - into WordPress. So there's a few ways to add a new 
post, I can either hover in the post and go to add  
47:26 - new, or I can hover over this new at the top, go 
to post, there's a bunch of things you can add.  
47:32 - So I'll go to new post. And I will create a new 
article, website offers free developer curriculum.  
47:43 - So I'm just gonna start typing in here.  
47:47 - You can learn to code for free at Free 
Code camp.org. It's a great website.  
48:04 - And then I can add something else. So I can click 
this plus button here. And I can add a gallery,  
48:10 - which is makes it so you can see multiple 
images and switch between them, or a quote,  
48:15 - or an image, I'll go to image. And I'll go to 
the media library. And we'll just add these,  
48:20 - this milk here. So we have this text. And then 
we have this image here. And then I can even  
48:28 - change the size. So if I go to the side, it's 
gonna give us some more options. So image size,  
48:34 - I'm gonna do a medium image. And then if we 
go to advanced, you can add title attributes,  
48:40 - you can make a link here, additional CSS. But 
what I'm also want to do is make sure for this  
48:47 - post I'm you can add a bunch of other things in 
in your blog posts. But what I'm going to do is  
48:54 - make sure I assign it to a specific category, 
this is going to be in the news category. I also  
49:00 - want to make sure I add a featured image. This 
is the image that will appear at the very top  
49:06 - of the article. So the featured image is not an 
image from the article, you have to add a another  
49:12 - image. So I'm going to click show featured 
image. And I'm going to go to upload files.  
49:20 - And that's gonna drag a file in here. 
And again, I am going to add an alt text  
49:28 - Free Code Camp website. And then 
I'll set it as the featured image,  
49:34 - which is just a screenshot of 
the Free Code Camp website.  
49:40 - And there's a few other things you can do. Like 
we can change the excerpt. This is optional,  
49:47 - but if you want to basically like a summary of 
the article that's going to appear on the when  
49:53 - it's showing the list of all articles, this 
would be the excerpt that's going to show  
49:56 - up and you can also set tags So, tags will 
be different than categories. And it's just  
50:03 - another way to chain. It's just another way to 
sort your articles. So I could say, websites.  
50:11 - And then it says separate with the comments or 
the enter keys. So what we can now search. Now,  
50:17 - we can now add this tag to the article. Okay, 
now I can click Publish to publish the article.
50:30 - And then I can even click View Post right here. 
So here's the Post website offers free developer  
50:36 - curriculum. And we can see this is the main image. 
And here's the article. And then we even have some  
50:44 - related posts. And if I click on the news page, so 
here's one of the posts. Here's the other posts.  
50:50 - So we have three different posts, including the 
Free Code Camp post. And you can basically do  
50:58 - that for basically whatever category you add, is 
the category it's going to show up on here. Okay,  
51:05 - that's basically all there is to it to adding blog 
entries, and customizing blog entries. Let's look  
51:12 - at how to customize the about page and the contact 
page. So the way you customize this, about page is  
51:19 - going to be just like we did that the homepage. So 
we're going to edit with Elementor. And now we can  
51:24 - go through and in update things on here, like this 
thing right here, we probably don't even though  
51:30 - that's all right click, and then I will delete. 
And now we can go through and update this text.  
51:38 - We are the most trusted news source. And you 
can go through and just update this as much as  
51:46 - you want. And we can delete a section like 
this, this looks like it's supposed to be  
51:52 - like an ad or something, well, I want to change 
that name. As we don't want to use an ad image,  
51:56 - I'll just change it to this one right here. So 
now you can go through. And basically you can  
52:03 - change as much as you want see, any way you click 
it, you can just go through and start editing.  
52:08 - So it's pretty straightforward. It's kind of, 
so I'm not going to go through and change all  
52:14 - these things. But when we go to the contact 
page, it's going to be a little different.  
52:21 - actually refresh the page, I didn't click 
update. So it didn't save this. That's okay,  
52:26 - you know how to do it. So we're gonna just look 
at how to update the Contact page, because that's  
52:30 - gonna be a little different. But sometimes when 
you're in Elementor, to get to another page,  
52:35 - you're first going to have to go out of Elementor. 
And then you can go back into it. So I'm just  
52:39 - going to go to View page, go into contact, and 
then we'll go to edit with Elementor. Again,  
52:44 - and so you can a lot this stuff, you can edit 
just like you did before, like for this company  
52:51 - information, set up having an address, I'm 
going to get rid of that. And I'm going to say,  
52:57 - bow at Free Code camp.org. So I'm just going to 
put an email address. And then I can actually  
53:05 - make this a clickable email address, I'll to, to 
make to make an email address that you can click  
53:12 - on and it opens your default editor, you can type 
in a link just like this, you mail to and then put  
53:19 - a colon and then just put the email address. 
And then this time, I am going to put update.  
53:26 - But if I click here, we can 
see no matter where I click,  
53:31 - this is actually just becoming a form. There's 
no way to change on this form. There's no way to  
53:37 - change what this CEO says first name, last name, 
email address, there's no way to change on here,  
53:42 - what that looks like. So to actually change the 
form, there's something else we have to do. So  
53:48 - what I'm going to do is going to set that I'm 
going to go out of Elementor I'm gonna go to View  
53:53 - page. And then I'm gonna go to WP forms, WP forms 
where you're going to make edits to the form. And  
54:01 - we have a newsletter signup form. And we have 
a contact form where the newsletter signup form  
54:07 - was on the main page. Also, I think it's at the 
bottom here to see here's the newsletter signup  
54:12 - form. And then here's the contact form. 
So I'm going to go to edit form. Okay,  
54:18 - so here's how we can edit the form. So we have 
the first name, last name, email address message,  
54:24 - what if we want something else so I can actually 
add a different another thing to this form. So  
54:31 - I'm going to go to add fields. And you can see we 
have a lot of different choices. What I'm going to  
54:37 - add is a drop down so I'm just going to drag it 
in. And now if I click it says click to edit if  
54:42 - I click here, I can now change this so how did 
you hear about us and you can say search engine  
54:57 - advertisement  
55:03 - word of mouth. And we can set this required 
if we want. And see when we hit required,  
55:12 - I'll put that asterik. And you then you won't be 
able to submit the form unless it's filled out.  
55:17 - But we will make this required. So we just added 
that to the form and see how this has to as first  
55:25 - name and last name? Well, if I go here, I'm going 
to go to simple. So now it's only gonna have one  
55:30 - field. So we basically can do first, middle 
last, first, last, or simple, which is just,  
55:37 - it's just going to have one blank for the name. So 
that's what we want. So we want the one blank for  
55:42 - the name. And and then we want the email address, 
how did you hear about us and message and it's  
55:46 - set up. So when you click submit, it's going to 
automatically submit the email to whatever email  
55:52 - address you have as your administrator email on 
WordPress. So it's automatically gonna just send  
55:57 - an email right to your email address. And there's 
a bunch of other things you can do on this day, a  
56:04 - bunch of different other types of fields, you 
can use like these ones, I think you have to  
56:08 - get the paid version. But this is just going to be 
just enough this, but just these fields are going  
56:14 - to be pretty good. So I'm going to save this. 
And if I put x on here, and then I'm going to  
56:22 - go back to my site, and we go back to the contact 
form. And now we can see this, so the name field,  
56:27 - and that just gives us one, one box here, I guess 
it doesn't say name and there anymore. So that's,  
56:35 - that's what we probably want to change that but 
we have email address, now we can choose from  
56:39 - this drop down box really quick, let's see 
how we can change that to actually show that  
56:43 - that's the name field. So I'm gonna go to edit 
again, the contact form, go to the name field.  
56:52 - And then under advanced, I can put what 
the placeholder is. So placeholder is  
56:59 - what's going to show up in there until someone 
types in something, so I'll just type in name,  
57:05 - and then default value will be so then this 
placeholder is gonna be like the grayed out text,  
57:11 - a default value would be an actual entry 
that would automatically be in there. So  
57:16 - I'm going to save that. And we will go back 
to the page. And now Yeah, so I can click  
57:21 - here. And I can just select my name here, and 
you can see it. So when nothing was in there,  
57:26 - we had the placeholder which says name here, the 
fields required. And then, so I can type in that.  
57:36 - Hello, and then I'll just click 
Submit, and it should submit that form.  
57:44 - And see when I submit it says, Thanks for 
contacting us, we will be with you shortly. Well,  
57:50 - that's another thing that you set up in WP forms, 
let me go back to the contact page like that. I've  
57:56 - got a contact form, edit form. And if I go to 
Settings, and then confirmations, thanks for  
58:02 - contacting us, we'll be in touch with you shortly. 
So this is where you would change what's going to  
58:07 - show on the page when someone fills out the form. 
Now, if you go through and test out your form,  
58:15 - and it doesn't work, let me show you how you 
can fix that. So we're gonna go go to settings,  
58:19 - notifications. And if you see right here, it says 
the current from email address does not match  
58:26 - your website domain name, this can cause your 
notification notification emails to be blocked or  
58:31 - marked as spam. So right now it's sending to the 
end email, which is definitely what I want. But  
58:38 - it's coming from an email. But we don't want it to 
come from edit admin email it's doing right here,  
58:44 - you may want to it says try using a form 
address that matches your website domain.  
58:48 - And then it gives us a suggestion, which I'm 
just going to use this Simon make it come come  
58:54 - from no reply@bow.net. And then we can also 
change that. So this is going to be called  
59:03 - Tech tuber. And then we can even change the email 
subject line that comes in. So I'll put new entry  
59:11 - tech tuba. And now I can just check all 
these other things. And this looks good.  
59:21 - So I'm going to save this. Okay, now I'm going 
to test out the form again. Now we could test  
59:29 - it on the page like we did before, but it can 
also just test it here. But I can also test it  
59:35 - by just clicking this preview button here. And 
now. It's the contact form preview so it's not  
59:41 - really on the contact page with exact same form. 
And I just want to test to make sure it works.
59:49 - Does my form work? Okay. You always want 
to make sure it works before before you  
59:57 - launch your website because you want to make 
Make sure that people sort of contact you,  
60:01 - it actually just does actually come in. And I 
went to my email and actually had to go to my  
60:06 - spam folder. So I'm gonna go to my spam folder 
here. And then you can see it came in. And  
60:13 - I'm going to do report not spam. So hopefully 
next time, I won't go to my spam folder. Now,  
60:20 - we've already learned how to update a lot of parts 
of our websites. But let's do a few more things.  
60:24 - You can see when I click reviews, if you look 
at the URL here, that's not a really a good URL,  
60:30 - cat equals three, we want this to say, reviews 
here. So and then if I click on actual article,  
60:38 - it just says P equals 39. That's not the type 
of URL that we want. And it's not really search  
60:45 - engine optimized. So I'm gonna go back over to 
my dashboard, then I'm gonna go to Settings,  
60:50 - and then go to permalinks. So this is where we 
change what the link is going to look like. And  
60:58 - right now we have on plane, that's the default. 
And that's basically the worst thing that you  
61:04 - don't you don't want plane. Personally, I think 
the best thing is just to use post name. So this  
61:10 - is going to be a lot more readable URL. And so 
it's not just going to be like P equals 123,  
61:16 - it's going to be the actual name of the post. 
So I'm going to click save changes. And then  
61:23 - I'm just going to refresh here. And now if I go 
to reviews, we can see category reviews. Well,  
61:30 - that's all I want go here, category gaming. If I 
click on a actual article, you can see actually  
61:36 - the article now this is just some sample text here 
for the article name. But if we go let's go to  
61:43 - the article that that we wrote here, they click 
here, website offers free developer curriculum,  
61:49 - that looks pretty good, that looks a lot better. 
But let me show you how you would if you didn't  
61:54 - like this URL, let me show you how you change that 
I forgot to edit post here, I can actually edit  
61:59 - the post, but I can also edit the URL. So just 
click right into the URL here. And website offers  
62:06 - free instead, website offers free drip developer 
curriculum, I'm going to say Free Code Camp.  
62:15 - Okay, now update. And then 
we will, I'll go to Preview  
62:24 - and preview a new tab. And now we can see. So we 
don't really want the preview, we want the actual  
62:30 - one. So let me go to news. And this Free Code Camp 
offers free developer curriculum. Great, that's  
62:38 - the exact type of URL we want. Now I want to talk 
to you more about making your website responsive.  
62:45 - What I'm gonna do is go into I'm gonna 
go actually back to the homepage here,  
62:48 - I just click this link here or the the the logo 
to go back to the homepage, and I'm gonna go back  
62:55 - to edit with Elementor. Now we're going to talk 
about how to make sure it looks good, whether  
63:01 - it's on a desktop, a tablet, or a mobile device. 
If we come down here to the bottom left corner,  
63:09 - and it says responsive mode. If I click this, 
now, we can see this new menu at the top here,  
63:15 - I'm gonna go back to full screen. And we 
can see this is desktop mode, tablet mode,  
63:21 - or mobile. So I'm gonna click on mobile. Now 
it's showing what this is going to look like  
63:27 - on mobile. And we can actually make changes 
like so far, this looks pretty good. But we can  
63:34 - actually make changes to what it's going to look 
like only on mobile. So I'm going to click here.  
63:41 - And this, I want this to be centered, but only on 
mobile. So I'm going to click on style, and then  
63:51 - okay, and then content. And then 
I'm gonna click the centered button.  
63:57 - And then you can see, see how there's this little 
mobile icon. That's how we know it's only being  
64:03 - centered when it's on mobile. So I can click 
update. Now, let me switch between. So on the  
64:10 - not mobile on desktop, we can see this is left 
aligned. But if I switch back to mobile, we can  
64:17 - see that it's centered. So that makes it it's and 
then we can also see we have this hamburger menu  
64:23 - here. That's going to look a lot better on mobile. 
And so that's just a nice way to test what your  
64:30 - website is going to look on for different aspect 
ratios and different types of devices. See, that  
64:36 - looks pretty good. And then you can always make 
changes that are specific to one type of device  
64:43 - or aspect ratio, just how I showed you. Okay, we 
go out of this. And now we're going to look at  
64:49 - how we can update this footer here. So everything 
down here, we can't just we can't just edit with  
64:56 - elemental and excellent go back into Elementor 
there's no way to see it. If I move my mouse  
65:01 - around here, nothing's really highlighting as the 
different sections. So to modify the footer, we're  
65:08 - gonna have to go there's a few different ways to 
get into the method where you modify the footer,  
65:13 - but I'm gonna go into customize. And then once I'm 
in the Customize header builder is how you update  
65:21 - what the header is going to look like. So we have 
the menu here, the Search button. So if I just  
65:27 - if we like this subscribe button, what that's 
really not helpful here, because we already have  
65:32 - the surprise the subscribe form in another place, 
so I can just remove that subscribe button. And  
65:39 - the same thing with the header, I'm gonna go 
or the same thing with the footer, I'm gonna  
65:43 - go to footer builder, and the footer builder, we 
can see there's three different sections of the  
65:49 - footer. So this top section with the menu that's 
right here, the social icons right here, then we  
65:55 - have this HTML, that's basically this text right 
here, this widget, which is this subscribe form,  
66:01 - and the copyright form at the bottom. So if I 
click on any one of those things, you can see  
66:07 - it's going to change what's in the side menu. So 
the footer menu, I'm going to keep that basically  
66:12 - the same for the social icons, this is where I 
can update the links for the social icons, or just  
66:19 - take them away, like, we're probably not going to 
want Facebook. But for YouTube, I can just type  
66:25 - in the YouTube URL, so ACBS, colon slash less 
youtube.com/free code camp, and then or we can  
66:36 - update the Twitter URL. So https colon, slash 
slash twitter.com/free. Code Camp. And then  
66:48 - we can also change what the icons is going to 
look like. So basically, I want the the icon,  
66:54 - but let's say we want to add a new new thing. 
So I can, basically we can, we can click any  
67:02 - of these. And just to add social icon, it's gonna 
look like little phone here. But I can change the  
67:09 - icon. And there's a bunch of icons available. 
So it can just kind of go through these pages,  
67:15 - or I can search the icon, I'm going to make it 
this bacterium. So if I click on that bacterium,  
67:26 - now we have a, we should be able to 
have a bacterium, a bacterium icon.  
67:33 - But I don't really want that. So they go out of 
that. And I'm, basically we're just going to have  
67:38 - to hear Twitter and YouTube. And then I can also 
change this right here. So instead of sign up  
67:45 - to receive email updates for US News and more, 
as I say, sign up to receive news. This button  
67:53 - this little form here, you edit just what that WP 
forms the same way we updated the contact form,  
68:00 - you can update this was just one little, this 
really small form here. And but now we can also  
68:07 - update the copyright. So we can say cap rate, we 
can say when it says cap rate, and these, these  
68:15 - brackets here, that's the cap rate sign, current 
year, site title. Anytime there's the brackets  
68:22 - that we're doing something dynamic here, the site 
title, and then powered by site title, or we can  
68:28 - put created by, you can see it's an update right 
there. Okay, now, I'm just going to publish that.  
68:36 - Okay, great. So now we learn how to 
update all the stuff in the footer.
68:42 - And this is looking pretty good. I mean, it's 
not like professionally designed or anything. But  
68:47 - we're learning we've learned how to update pretty 
much everything in this blog. Now let's learn how  
68:53 - to make one more type of page. So we know how 
to make the blog entries. And we know how to  
69:00 - edit the list of blog entries here. But there's 
this other type the about. So this about page  
69:08 - is a page. And let's say you want another just 
informational page, you don't want to be a blog,  
69:13 - you want to just be some sort of other piece 
of information that we can put on our websites.  
69:19 - Let's say that you want to offer consulting 
services, and you want to give people information  
69:25 - about how they can learn more about that. Well, 
let me show you how you would do that. Let's  
69:29 - go back to our administrator page. And I'm 
gonna go to where it says pages. So first,  
69:36 - I'll just click here we can see all the current 
pages, we can see that we have the about contact  
69:40 - home. And then we have some pages that we're not 
using. Like we're not using the podcast page. So  
69:45 - right now I'm just going to delete this I'm gonna 
click that and then just click trash, or it could  
69:50 - just click trash actually selecting it so you 
can do a bulk action. But let's create a new  
69:55 - page and then we'll add it to our top menu. So I'm 
gonna go up to the top it says add new But first,  
70:00 - I'm just going to close that. And then we'll add 
a new page. And I will just call it consulting.  
70:09 - And you can just call it whatever you want. And 
now we're going to edit it basically very similar  
70:15 - to how you edit a blog post, I offer consulting 
services, if you want to schedule a meeting,  
70:27 - click the link below. And 
now I'm going to add a button  
70:39 - contact me. And then I can just do contact if I if 
I just type start typing contact, it will, it will  
70:48 - do a search for the different pages we already 
have. So I can make this Contact Me button,  
70:54 - go to the contact page. So you can obviously add 
different images, you can design this how you  
70:59 - want, like, I could click this plus button, plus 
thing, and then add a gallery, where we can just  
71:06 - choose a few different images for the gallery. 
Actually, this one, I will choose the people.  
71:13 - So you can choose all these images for a 
gallery and then do create new gallery.  
71:18 - And you can even adjust the order of the 
images in the gallery. Okay, so now let's  
71:23 - just see what this looks like. So I can before 
I can publish it, I can also change the URL.  
71:30 - Right now it's on auto draft I'm going to so you 
can see it's eventually going to be consulting,  
71:35 - that's going to be the permalink which which 
is what we want, you can change the URL if  
71:40 - you want. And I will just click publish. And then 
just click Publish again. And now I can view the  
71:48 - page. And here's our page consulting. If I offer 
consulting service, we have the contact me which  
71:54 - goes to the contact page, it but we can go back. 
And this doesn't really look that good. But you  
72:01 - can kind of get the idea of where you can just add 
different pictures, you can design it exactly how  
72:05 - you want. So let's see how to add the consulting 
page to this top menu. Well, it's similar to when  
72:12 - we were adjusting what links are up here. And we 
can do the same thing with our consulting page. So  
72:18 - I'm going to go back to WordPress dashboard. And 
then I'm going to go to Appearance and Menus. And  
72:26 - now we can add a new section. So basically, I can 
click here, where it says consulting. And so these  
72:34 - are all the things that aren't currently in the 
menu. Well, I guess some of them are in the menu,  
72:37 - but I'll click consulting and do Add to Menu. 
And then I can just reorder it, and put it right  
72:46 - before about. And then if we go to Save Menu, and 
now I can open the page again. And we can see that  
72:53 - the consulting page. So we have the the main page 
views gaming, and consulting. Okay, we learned  
73:00 - how to add a page. Now let's talk about search 
engine optimization. Let's go back to our main,  
73:07 - our main dashboard. So we are going to install 
a special plugin that's going to help our blog

75:46 - to when you're creating a blog entry. So a lot 
of things like the SEO analysis, the readability  
75:52 - analysis, and a lot of this is going to appear 
when you're actually creating a blog post. So  
76:00 - and these weren't for both new posts and posts you 
already have. So let me show you how that works.  
76:04 - I'm gonna go to the posts, and then we'll go to 
the website offers free developer curriculum.  
76:11 - And if we scroll down here, we can see 
there's a new section here, Yoast SEO.  
76:18 - And then we have the focus key phrase, and 
we click here, it's gonna show what that is.  
76:22 - So it says, you'll find a focus key phrase 
input field for every page on your site,  
76:26 - you can enter the keyword or key phrase you like 
you'd like the page to rank for in Google. And  
76:32 - then the Yoast SEO will read check on the pages 
contents to see if search engines will recognize  
76:36 - that's what it's about. So let's let's see how 
that works. So for this, we want to get the phrase  
76:42 - learn to code. So I'm just going to type in, 
learn to code. And we'll get related key phrases.  
76:51 - Okay, and I'm going to approve 
it for this application.  
76:56 - And now we can see our related key phrases. So 
I typed in, learn to code, and it's showing all  
77:02 - these related ones. But now that we've put in 
this key phrase, so really a key phrase would  
77:09 - be other phrases that kind of go along with 
it. So this will show us the volume of like,  
77:16 - how many searches are happening for that key 
phrase? So we can try to figure out which  
77:21 - key phrase should we optimize for which key 
phrases should we put in our title? Should we  
77:26 - put in the body of our article? And then so 
let's just keep going down here and look at  
77:31 - some of these other things. We can see the Google 
preview, what it's going to look like and Google.  
77:36 - And we can see information from the page. And then 
look at this the SEO analysis. So this is going to  
77:44 - give us some information that we can improve on. 
Have you evenly distributed your focus key phrase  
77:49 - throughout the whole text? Well, no, because it 
was just like a very quick article. And we want  
77:55 - to see at some so these are all suggestions and 
outbound links, and internal links. Make sure  
78:01 - the key phrases in the SEO title, update the 
meta description link. That's this description  
78:07 - here that we can we can update that description, 
that text link, that text link contains 13 words,  
78:12 - it's recommended to be 300 words. So it's gonna 
give us all these suggestions, it gives us things  
78:18 - that we're doing good. And we can go through and 
this is gonna give us some information about how  
78:23 - to make our articles more SEO friendly. And then 
we can there's a bunch of other things here. But  
78:29 - let's go to this next tab, readability. So this is 
going to tell us how read a readable article is.
78:39 - And for the most part, we have a lot of good 
results. But that's just because an article is  
78:45 - pretty short. So if you have a longer article, 
it will give you more suggestions for how to  
78:48 - improve the readability. And here is where you 
can update the schema. Now it says right here,  
78:55 - this helps search engines understand your website 
and your content. So this page default proposed  
79:00 - this is a blog post, we want to just keep it that 
article type blog posts. So these are generally  
79:05 - going to be correct automatically. But if you want 
to change like this, if this is the about page,  
79:09 - a fact page, these are those are going to be 
more specific for those pages on the about page,  
79:15 - it's not going to know it's the about page unless
