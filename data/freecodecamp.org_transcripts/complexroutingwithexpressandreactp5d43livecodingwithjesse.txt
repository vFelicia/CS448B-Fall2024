00:04 - hey everyone welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jessie I'm Jessie today we're going to
00:12 - do some routing with node and Express
00:15 - and we had a pull request from Nikki aka
00:23 - rook in the live chat and I don't think
00:27 - Nikki's gonna be able to make it to this
00:29 - chat but we're gonna go over that pool
00:30 - request I had mentioned yesterday some
00:33 - of the things I needed to do with the
00:34 - routing Nikki reminded me that there was
00:38 - already a pull request there that was
00:40 - trying to fix the same problems so
00:44 - apologies to Nikki for me forgetting
00:47 - about that but I did review the pull
00:50 - request I have it on a branch here
00:52 - locally and it looks good it looks I
00:57 - think it's gonna solve all the problems
00:59 - that I was talking about yesterday so
01:04 - we're gonna merge that into the master
01:07 - branch and we're gonna try it out with
01:09 - some of our more difficult routes make
01:11 - sure everything works alright I'm also
01:14 - going to take you through the logic of
01:15 - it and we're gonna try to find any areas
01:17 - where we could make it faster more
01:23 - efficient where we could clean up the
01:25 - code if if at all possible and that's
01:31 - the plan for today I do want to let you
01:34 - all know well we're kind of waiting for
01:37 - viewers to get here that I received a
01:42 - job offer yesterday afternoon so I'm not
01:47 - gonna share details at least not right
01:52 - now so anyway so I received a job offer
01:58 - so I have a lot of thinking to do about
02:01 - that but I know that some of you have
02:03 - been following my kind of process of
02:06 - interviewing and things like that so I
02:08 - just wanted to give you an update
02:12 - yeah so I will I will be giving you more
02:15 - updates as things happen and Blake asks
02:21 - if it's a bigger company I guess I think
02:28 - like in terms of total employees I don't
02:31 - think it's as big as the University but
02:36 - like geographically it's more spread out
02:41 - so there are multiple locations where
02:45 - does the university is mainly just one
02:47 - location with I mean we do have a campus
02:50 - in Austria so I guess it's two all right
03:04 - ib shik is asking about CSS we're not
03:07 - gonna do a lot with CSS today but we do
03:09 - use CSS you know somewhat frequently so
03:12 - if you check out some of the other
03:14 - streams as well we'll get into that but
03:16 - you know if you want to stick around
03:17 - today we're you know we are gonna do a
03:19 - lot a lot of other stuff Blake asked if
03:23 - it's a web developer job yeah yeah it is
03:27 - you know basically doing a lot of the
03:28 - same stuff I'm doing right now I'd still
03:31 - be working with react which is cool
03:38 - all right well let's get started and
03:43 - mites all right so now you should be
03:49 - able to see my screen if you want to
03:53 - check out the pool requests that we're
03:56 - about to merge you can go to the
03:59 - repository under pool requests currently
04:01 - it's the only pool request that is not
04:03 - merged so it'll be easy to find and the
04:08 - particular file that we're really
04:10 - worried about right now is server j/s so
04:14 - we're gonna spend all of our time in
04:16 - server dodge as there are a few other
04:19 - things that think need will probably end
04:26 - up just getting rid of them because
04:27 - there was some test things here like you
04:29 - can see hat and hat list Jas so there
04:32 - are some test things just so that Nikki
04:33 - could illustrate near the new features
04:36 - that he built into this pool request
04:38 - so we'll probably get rid of those at
04:41 - some point today let me start my
04:44 - Pomodoro session so for those of you who
04:46 - are new I'm not sure how the stream goes
04:48 - I break things up by Pomodoro session so
04:51 - I will start this clock it'll be 25
04:54 - minutes for 25 minutes we're going to go
04:56 - through the code I'm gonna not really
04:59 - look at the live chat that much during
05:01 - that time so I will glance at it
05:02 - occasionally but after that 25 minutes
05:07 - is up I'm gonna take a five-minute break
05:08 - go back to the live chat and go through
05:11 - all your questions and comments and then
05:14 - we're going to do another 25 minute
05:16 - session of code after that the whole
05:18 - rest of the stream will be question and
05:21 - answer so if you ask a question and I'm
05:24 - not getting into it right away please be
05:27 - patient and I will get to it
05:29 - you know within you know the longest you
05:33 - have to wait is is till the end of the
05:36 - stream I suppose and if you can't stick
05:40 - around to hear the answer you can always
05:41 - watch the recording and for those of you
05:45 - that already watching the recording
05:47 - later on you can ask me questions as
05:50 - well in the comment
05:51 - below and or in any type of social media
05:54 - that you like I'm on pretty much all the
05:57 - the main social media channels so just
06:01 - find me somewhere so I can't always get
06:03 - back to everyone right away but I do try
06:05 - to get back to everyone at some point
06:07 - all right so enough about that let's
06:11 - just get started so I'm not gonna start
06:17 - and rock yet whenever we get this merge
06:20 - then I'll start and rock and right now
06:25 - it's just not I mean I guess we could
06:28 - start it and it would work all right so
06:33 - what I've done so far I've made no
06:36 - changes to the code manually but I've
06:39 - just merged what we had in master
06:42 - because master was a little bit farther
06:44 - ahead than this this pull request so I
06:48 - merged everything in master into this
06:51 - alt router branch the OL trout er branch
06:54 - is not in the repo right now and I won't
06:57 - push it to the repo because we're gonna
06:59 - merge it right now it'll be part of
07:00 - master so what did change from what's in
07:04 - the pool requests are some of the the
07:07 - routes in here see so we we have a route
07:10 - name search that will be in there so
07:14 - just a few minor changes so I'm gonna
07:17 - increase the font size make some room
07:19 - and then step through what's going on
07:21 - and then that way as we step through it
07:25 - maybe we can get an idea for ways to
07:29 - improve it although nothing against
07:33 - nakey this is really genius I love this
07:36 - but if there's a way to make it faster
07:40 - refactor it a bit then we should take
07:43 - the opportunity because this is a key
07:45 - function every single visit is going to
07:48 - go through this function for every page
07:50 - view so if we're gonna find one spot
07:53 - where refactoring is gonna have the most
07:55 - value it'll be here so anything we can
07:59 - do just to make it just a little bit
08:01 - faster will have a huge impact you know
08:04 - when
08:05 - multiplied by all the visits you know
08:07 - which will get which which will be
08:09 - millions over the course of I think over
08:13 - the course of a year we're getting I
08:15 - don't know four or five million visits
08:17 - so you know it's not like we're you know
08:22 - top ten site in the world or anything
08:24 - like that but it's a lot of visits okay
08:28 - so here's our object so if you have been
08:32 - watching when we've done things about
08:33 - the router earlier then you you know
08:35 - what's going on here
08:36 - but if you haven't basically this object
08:39 - we're listing a lot of routes so this
08:42 - value here is what's going to come in
08:44 - through the URL so in this case you know
08:48 - I'm doing this locally so it's localhost
08:50 - 3000 slash if you went to slash faculty
08:54 - we're saying go to that component the
08:57 - page component called faculty that's
09:02 - what we want to render and the data type
09:05 - is faculty so we're telling the router
09:11 - what component to send this data to and
09:14 - then we're telling it the data that
09:16 - actually needs sent and then with that
09:18 - it's going to go through a graph QL
09:23 - query to WordPress it's gonna get the
09:27 - data when the data comes back the
09:31 - component will render and then the user
09:34 - will be able to see the data the reason
09:38 - that we are doing it like this and it
09:42 - looks I mean it looks a little messy
09:44 - right honestly is because we have to
09:47 - keep all the routes all the URLs the
09:49 - same from the current site the old site
09:53 - to this new one that we're making so in
09:55 - order to do that you know we need a lot
09:58 - of control over what the routes are so
10:00 - we couldn't just use a built-in routing
10:03 - solution that comes with next chasse you
10:06 - know or even you know trying to use a
10:10 - different routing solution you know may
10:14 - or may not have worked but it would have
10:16 - required a lot of customers
10:18 - so we're just you know basically doing
10:20 - everything custom you know within
10:23 - express within our server dodge as file
10:27 - one thing that I think would be good as
10:30 - this gets bigger is to put this into its
10:32 - own file and just import it in so that's
10:37 - actually maybe I'll make an issue about
10:39 - that and then that'll be a really nice
10:40 - like very easy pool request for somebody
10:44 - to get if you're looking to get some
10:47 - pool request you're getting a profile
10:49 - especially if it'll be like your first
10:51 - pull request so maybe I'll save that as
10:55 - an issue all right so let's to actually
11:00 - step through what happens when you go to
11:05 - somewhere on the site so we'll go
11:09 - through an easy example first so if we
11:11 - go to slash search let's just assume we
11:14 - went to slash search it would go here
11:18 - and you know server get would fire off
11:22 - and we would do we're checking
11:30 - parameters right so in this case we only
11:33 - have this first parameter okay so the
11:39 - other ones there's there's not going to
11:40 - be anything there right we are making
11:43 - sure all the parameters go to lower case
11:47 - and
11:54 - yeah okay so if the parameter exists
11:57 - which is pretty much every page except
11:59 - the home page then we're going to take
12:02 - it you know put it to lowercase
12:04 - otherwise it's going to be null and it's
12:05 - the same thing for each parameter so
12:07 - it's either going to be null or it's
12:09 - going to be the lowercase version of
12:12 - that part of the URL we do have some
12:16 - things that we want to we don't want to
12:19 - do anything to in terms of custom
12:21 - routing so any files that have these
12:24 - parameters we're just going to let them
12:27 - pass right through and we're not gonna
12:29 - do custom routing otherwise we're gonna
12:34 - go down here and we have a few things so
12:39 - we have this default page route and
12:43 - that's just kind of a it has minimal
12:46 - styles
12:47 - it's our default component to display
12:48 - data we do have more specialized
12:52 - components to display certain types of
12:54 - data we also have our site if the user
13:00 - doesn't specify a type they're going to
13:03 - take the parameter and then just add
13:05 - pages onto the end of it and that will
13:08 - be the type okay we've done it like this
13:10 - because this is the naming convention
13:13 - that I'm using for data types for for a
13:18 - lot of the data types not all of them
13:20 - make sense to do it like that but enough
13:22 - of them do that this is a good default
13:24 - and will save us you know some space in
13:27 - our object and then the subtype and the
13:31 - ID or no for now and they will be given
13:36 - a value if they exist in this case when
13:39 - we're just doing the search route they
13:41 - they don't exist so actually let me let
13:47 - me know if anyone's still there I
13:49 - haven't seen anything in the live chat
13:51 - for a while and that's weird
13:52 - everyone's usually more talkative so
13:54 - it's showing that there are viewers but
13:57 - there we are
13:59 - okay that's something new I was afraid
14:02 - that the the stream cut out or something
14:07 - okay let's see all right hopefully y'all
14:12 - are still with me let me know if I need
14:14 - to explain something else you know over
14:17 - again if it's not clear so now we're
14:20 - really getting into the logic of things
14:22 - here so we're gonna filter out this is
14:28 - kind of interesting let me make this a
14:32 - bit bigger as well okay so we have an
14:38 - object right and normally you don't use
14:40 - filter on an object you use filter on an
14:44 - array so what object got values does and
14:48 - we're doing that on our params object
14:53 - that values returns an array of the
14:57 - values of the object so objects are our
15:01 - objects have key value pairs we are just
15:07 - getting the values and then we're
15:09 - filtering and we want to know if the
15:17 - length is equal to 1 all right why 1
15:23 - because 1 we were checking for one
15:27 - parameter and the the comments in here
15:30 - that that Nickey put in here are really
15:32 - good to explain what's going on so we're
15:35 - actually this will pass this this if
15:38 - statement will pass for what we have
15:39 - right now and if we had two or three
15:44 - parameters it would fail and we pass to
15:47 - the next one so
15:54 - if if they find so we're looking in that
16:01 - translation object so if we find as a
16:04 - key the name of that which would be
16:08 - searched which is in our translation
16:11 - object then we'll do what's in here so
16:17 - we're gonna get that search and then
16:20 - page right so within our search key we
16:25 - have a value so we basically have
16:27 - another object in there and then we have
16:30 - another key called page the value of
16:32 - that is going to be the component that
16:35 - we want to render this to and in this
16:38 - case we want to render it to the
16:41 - component name search okay so it's gonna
16:44 - find that and then it's going to check
16:47 - for this next if statement so if the
16:53 - value of page actually I'm sorry first
16:58 - it's just checking if this exists so I
17:00 - was I was getting ahead of myself
17:02 - so it's just checking to see if the page
17:04 - value exists for that then it's checking
17:07 - to see if the page value is an object if
17:09 - it is an object we want to get the
17:12 - default value for the object and this is
17:15 - some of the new stuff that's been at it
17:16 - in Bini key in this last pull request so
17:20 - what we're doing by making the page
17:23 - giving the page the option to be an
17:25 - object is that we can have the same
17:29 - route render to different components
17:34 - depending on the number of parameters so
17:36 - if it's one parameter it does the
17:38 - default but in this case we don't have a
17:41 - default on search so we're gonna drop
17:45 - down to this else statement so if there
17:47 - isn't a default but there's still a
17:48 - value there then it's just a string so
17:51 - we're just going to take that string so
17:53 - the value of page now becomes slash
17:58 - search the string slash search
18:02 - and we drop down to find our type and in
18:08 - this case I don't believe we have do we
18:12 - have the type let me double check our
18:14 - objects I don't think we have one no we
18:20 - don't so in this case with search we
18:23 - don't have a type we don't have an ID so
18:27 - it's just gonna pass down right we're
18:29 - gonna pass over that elsif over that
18:32 - else--if okay we're gonna pass all the
18:34 - way down to here and we're gonna render
18:37 - in cash and we're sending all the data
18:39 - that we need and where's a rendering
18:46 - cache there we are so within this
18:50 - function I'm not gonna go over this
18:51 - because this is a new stuff but
18:53 - basically we're checking to see if we
18:54 - have that cast already the actual markup
18:57 - rendered and cached on the the react
19:01 - that the node server where this lives if
19:03 - we do have a caster Rd great we just
19:06 - serve that up no need to go grab the
19:08 - data anywhere no need to re render it
19:11 - just goes right out this is best-case
19:13 - scenario the user is gonna get a near
19:15 - instantaneous response if it's not cash
19:20 - though then we're gonna send it through
19:22 - we're gonna render we're going to call
19:25 - this render to HTML and so we're gonna
19:27 - send all those query params and then
19:31 - that's when everything's gonna happen
19:32 - like I explained at the beginning where
19:34 - you know graph QL query is gonna go get
19:37 - some data from WordPress and then it's
19:39 - gonna render so the only difference if
19:45 - we had more parameters is that it would
19:49 - skip over that first if statement and
19:51 - would drop down to this else else if if
19:53 - we have two parameters and then it would
19:59 - get let's see there's a second frame
20:05 - coming to play
20:09 - okay there we go so something with two
20:12 - parameters then gets this value of we
20:15 - grab the page standard so instead of the
20:19 - default page we want to render this
20:22 - using a different component which we're
20:26 - going to give the key of standard and
20:28 - then if there are three it looks like
20:33 - this isn't finished yet so I don't think
20:37 - Nikki has finished this part yet so you
20:39 - know we'll need to grab we'll find an
20:41 - example of something that's three
20:43 - parameters we'll copy and paste a lot of
20:45 - this and then set it up see if we can
20:48 - get the three parameter thing to work
20:50 - okay I feel like I need to take a breath
20:54 - after that let me take a drink I have my
21:00 - G fuel handy as I usually do and alright
21:14 - I'm gonna quickly check the live chat to
21:15 - see if I lost anyone okay
21:22 - it looks good so in about ten minutes
21:26 - I'm going to come back and answer
21:27 - questions in in the live chat right now
21:31 - what I'd like to do is find a route I
21:37 - want to find a route where we're
21:39 - actually going to use some of this
21:40 - functionality and then we're gonna build
21:43 - out the rest of it so I guess we could
21:48 - this is entirely functional right now so
21:52 - let me merge this with master push it to
21:56 - github and then you'll have everything
21:59 - there to look at all the code so let's
22:05 - do that now so I'm gonna go back check
22:10 - out so we're going to check out master
22:12 - now we're on the master branch and I'm
22:15 - gonna do a git merge and we're going to
22:18 - merge that alts
22:21 - router branch I've already merged master
22:26 - indle router so there should be no merge
22:28 - conflicts going the other way I always
22:30 - recommend doing that so that you can
22:32 - test everything out while you're still
22:35 - on that that branch I think it just
22:39 - makes things a lot easier especially if
22:41 - there there is you know there are weird
22:43 - things going on I mean if if nothing
22:47 - weird happens it probably takes a little
22:49 - bit longer but it's worth it in case it
22:53 - messes everything up then you can just
22:56 - abandon that branch start over much less
23:00 - of a mess so let's merge awesome we
23:05 - merged everything went well and now I'm
23:09 - gonna do git push so now all of this new
23:16 - code is there and I said there is some
23:23 - stuff to clean up so we may or may not
23:26 - get to that the actual clean up stuff
23:28 - because that's not really exciting it's
23:31 - a stream so if you do notice at some
23:34 - point that things still need cleaned up
23:36 - and you'd like to get an easy pull
23:37 - request you know feel free to do that I
23:41 - just I'd like to help you all who maybe
23:46 - haven't gotten very many pool requests
23:48 - in or none at all to be able to have you
23:51 - know get your first pull request in and
23:52 - get your practice in on something like
23:54 - this where we can I can help guide you
23:56 - through it if if needed and then you
24:00 - know build up your confidence a bit and
24:02 - then you can go off to other open source
24:03 - projects and you know and work on those
24:06 - is I know it's really intimidating to
24:08 - get that first pool request in on you
24:11 - know someone else's project alright so I
24:16 - need to go let me find I think I had a
24:22 - window open on my other screen that was
24:26 - a good example of the
24:29 - yes I do all right
24:43 - all right let me check this page out so
24:53 - academics undergrad majors currently
24:58 - works and that has three parts let's see
25:01 - where I have it going right now so I
25:04 - think I had two I think I had to mess
25:10 - things up a little bit to make it work
25:31 - actually let me I do want to restart
25:34 - this too just to make sure occasionally
25:38 - I have trouble when making big shifts
25:40 - between branches that some of the old
25:44 - code it remains so before I started
25:49 - doing anything I'm going to check this
25:51 - out okay
26:08 - all right so for that academics page is
26:11 - working
26:26 - what about our other academics pages
26:35 - okay no wait let's try to the our other
26:37 - academics pages so in our drawer if we
26:45 - should have a list of all the links in
26:50 - that side drawer and that's what we need
26:54 - to change here to do our tests sure menu
26:58 - [Music]
27:01 - bar so data yeah it is your menu okay
27:11 - all right so under academics you can see
27:14 - here we're passing in undergraduate so
27:21 - here's the URL that is typed in and then
27:25 - we're passing in here as page type
27:29 - academics pages ID majors okay cool so
27:33 - we are passing in everything that we
27:39 - need here so let's try passing in what
27:43 - we need from from this one so yeah page
27:54 - type academics pages ID graduate
28:11 - graduate programs
28:19 - the reason we're doing it like this has
28:22 - to do with our client-side routing so
28:25 - you wouldn't always have to do this
28:31 - all right let's save that and come back
28:37 - here and click this now okay can't
28:39 - really you know that undefined all right
28:42 - I was kind of hoping we got an error I
28:44 - didn't want it to it's not as fun when
28:48 - everything just works all right so first
28:53 - thing to check is within WordPress make
29:01 - sure that we actually have a page that
29:04 - fits this description
29:14 - we may not that might be the source of
29:16 - our error okay almost time to go back
29:29 - and answer questions okay cool so that's
29:32 - working my phone keeps thinking that I'm
29:36 - talking to it and it keeps coming up
29:38 - with you know the Google thing Google
29:42 - assistant alright cool so that is
29:47 - working awesome when we come back I'm
29:52 - gonna try to solve I'm gonna try to load
29:56 - some pages that I've been having issues
29:58 - with and make sure that our solution can
30:02 - handle that because I was I was wasting
30:07 - significant brainpower on trying to
30:09 - figure something out the last day or two
30:12 - so that's what we'll go to if if it
30:17 - passes that test let's say then I'm
30:20 - really confident that this will work for
30:22 - us so we can move on and build out what
30:25 - we need if we happen to get three three
30:34 - parameters in our URL okay so it when we
30:38 - just did this it was I don't want to say
30:41 - it was a little bit of a cheat but we
30:43 - were feeding the router exactly what we
30:45 - wanted what we want to do we're gonna do
30:49 - next though is users are gonna put in a
30:54 - route and it could be essentially like
31:00 - we won't be feeding the router the ID
31:02 - and the type and everything like we're
31:03 - doing in that list so we want to make
31:05 - sure it can still pick out these
31:07 - different parameters and go where it
31:08 - needs to go
31:15 - oh and I lost the live chat window where
31:19 - is it
31:23 - okay I found it I have live chat windows
31:27 - open for the last two weeks of streams I
31:31 - really really need to clean up my my
31:36 - tabs as soon as I update Chrome the wall
31:40 - go away okay let me set this short break
31:46 - and scroll up and get to the chat it's
31:49 - kind of quiet in the chat today and I
31:52 - that's not necessarily a bad thing
31:54 - oh cool I have so mad Dutchess says
32:05 - congratulations thank you if you missed
32:08 - it at the beginning I got a job offer
32:09 - for for a job last yesterday right at
32:17 - the end of my day at my work day I got a
32:21 - job offer so I'm considering it among
32:25 - other opportunities so I'll keep you all
32:28 - up to date on you know what happens and
32:30 - how it's gonna affect the stream but I
32:33 - just wanted to share that with you all
32:34 - since you've kind of been with me along
32:36 - this whole process of interviewing and
32:38 - things let's see
32:45 - Blake asks what do you think about view
32:48 - as it looks simpler than reacts I
32:50 - haven't used view so my opinion on you
32:53 - is not going to be very reliable let's
32:56 - say but I've seen enough def so that I
33:00 - respect and that do good work using view
33:04 - that I can be you know pretty sure that
33:07 - view is a solid product and I think it's
33:12 - a good alternative to reacts for
33:17 - whatever reason you met you may not want
33:18 - to use react so can't speak from
33:21 - experience but from what I do know I I
33:28 - think it's it looks promising it looks
33:31 - good I'm sorry I was a little distracted
33:33 - the head of my department just sent me a
33:35 - text okay when when your boss's boss
33:46 - messages you you got a you got to read
33:48 - it see Omar says the beard looks nice
33:58 - thank you I appreciate it it's getting a
34:01 - little bit longer I'm gonna get it
34:02 - trimmed tomorrow I'm gonna go get a
34:05 - haircut and the beard trimmed up so it's
34:07 - not gonna be that much shorter but it's
34:08 - just not gonna look at scruffy I did
34:11 - comb it this morning so I appreciate you
34:15 - noticing it's getting to the point now
34:20 - where I wake up and it's it's like wild
34:22 - and it looks crazy so if I don't comb it
34:24 - it's I mean it really looks like puffed
34:28 - out and wild Mohammed asks what software
34:35 - I use I'm using Visual Studio code as my
34:38 - code editor and my terminal that you can
34:43 - see in the background is I term - hey
34:50 - Nicki's here awesome
34:53 - Nicki I thought you had family coming
34:56 - over hopefully if your family comes

36:20 - lot of decisions to make now so I'm
36:22 - really happy to be in this predicament
36:25 - of having to really think and make some
36:28 - decisions now it's a good problem to
36:30 - have
36:31 - so yeah it's it's exciting
36:39 - Jason says congrats you thank you old
36:44 - sauce also says congrats says is this
36:48 - the job where you had a three hour long
36:50 - interview it is it is that one I begun
36:54 - to think that I wasn't gonna get an
36:56 - offer because a decent amount of time
36:59 - had gone by and I hadn't heard anything
37:01 - so it was a very good surprise when I
37:06 - got that it was right at the end of
37:08 - yesterday stream raid at the end of the
37:11 - stream I got
37:12 - during the stream I think but I just
37:15 - hadn't checked my email then and as soon
37:17 - as I ended the stream I checked my email
37:18 - quickly before I had my next meeting and
37:21 - I just saw it briefly got a chance to
37:25 - just scan through a little bit before my
37:27 - next meeting and then I was sitting
37:28 - through this other meeting just like I
37:31 - couldn't wait to come back and read
37:34 - through everything about the about the
37:36 - offer so anyway my timer is up so Mahmud
37:45 - says hello from Turkey ah so you do it
37:48 - awesome thank you thank you I appreciate
37:50 - it and welcome
37:53 - let's see jason says decisions on
37:56 - framework seemed to come down to team /
37:58 - project rather than features one has
38:00 - over another yeah honestly it there's a
38:03 - lot of different decision decision
38:06 - points that go into what tech you're
38:09 - going to use what stack you're going to
38:11 - use so yeah I guess it's not always just
38:15 - simply about let's compare feature by
38:18 - features so yeah there's a lot of them
38:23 - I've had to make a lot of decisions on
38:26 - what stack we're gonna use and there
38:29 - there is a lot more involved so luckily
38:31 - I've been able to kind of work my way to
38:34 - a point where I have a lot of freedom
38:36 - with the stack this tech stack that I
38:39 - choose and a lot of people are in that
38:42 - position so I do appreciate that I'm in
38:45 - a nice position there it's not
38:48 - everybody's in okay let's go back let's
38:52 - reset this timer we're gonna get in at
38:54 - least one more moment or a session and
38:59 - CNN video says I'm new how are you I'm
39:03 - doing really well today how are you
39:06 - doing also welcome thanks for watching
39:10 - and that's going to be the last comment
39:12 - that I read until after this next
39:15 - session all right so we tried out a few
39:18 - routes now here is where the the bigger
39:23 - test is gonna
39:25 - to play so let me I'm still trying to
39:29 - find on my other screen the routes that
39:32 - were giving me problems okay I think I
39:45 - found one all right so in our server dot
39:53 - j s file we have theology and right now
40:04 - it goes to the page major to render with
40:12 - the type of majors okay all right
40:30 - I've we are gonna have to modify this
40:37 - this function so what I need is just
40:41 - like how we can have multiple IDs and
40:44 - pages we need to be able to have
40:46 - multiple types I do I need the ability
40:50 - to pull from different post types all
40:56 - right so let's let's do that so right
41:00 - now what this is doing is if you go to
41:02 - the page slash theology it pulls the the
41:06 - post type with the the slug of majors or
41:11 - I'm sorry with the slug of theology from
41:13 - the post type majors and it renders that
41:17 - using the component major but then
41:21 - what's going to happen is we're gonna
41:22 - have a route and it'll be slash theology
41:24 - slash like online Associates is one of
41:28 - the routes what the the problem that is
41:33 - there is online Associates is going to
41:37 - exist as a
41:38 - from post type so it's not it doesn't
41:42 - belong in the the majors post type so
41:49 - that's where we need a change so let's
41:52 - go down here and see what we need to do
41:57 - apologies for the awning that's you only
42:00 - need to do to make that happen i I just
42:07 - I kept thinking it's this is so easy
42:10 - it's everything's working I knew it I
42:12 - knew we were forgetting something and so
42:16 - let's see where this is so the type so
42:19 - we're grabbing a default ID second frame
42:29 - all right so we're definitely going to
42:31 - do this in the second per am spot it
42:35 - makes no sense to do it with the first
42:36 - program so second program and where we
42:44 - have the type okay so the type now is
42:47 - going to be an object so let's grab all
42:51 - of this copy it
43:00 - now you know what I don't think I'm
43:02 - gonna copy it all because I wanna oh
43:05 - yeah I guess I can let's copy that and
43:11 - let's paste it here below this so we're
43:14 - gonna have to change everything here to
43:18 - type all right so all of that is tight
43:28 - and then let's keep this standard
43:33 - all right let's use that and so that way
43:36 - it'll be easier to kind of tell like
43:39 - okay if we have two params for both page
43:42 - and type it's both gonna be standard we
43:45 - may end up changing yeah maybe we can
43:51 - change that so Niki had mentioned about
43:53 - like the naming he wasn't really sure
43:55 - about the naming so for now I'm just
43:58 - gonna keep it the same because we all
43:59 - know the hardest part of coding is
44:01 - deciding what to name things well let's
44:04 - just keep it the same and let's remove
44:09 - this now and now what we should be able
44:12 - to do is go up here and put in or as I
44:21 - add theology so let's do it like this
44:25 - let's say we're gonna use the page type
44:29 - a major actually you know what I do want
44:34 - to keep it as major so I just glanced at
44:37 - how this page is structured on the
44:39 - current site I think we're gonna
44:40 - structure the same way but we are gonna
44:44 - change the type so Rd we're gonna have
44:51 - to do a default side too are we yeah
44:54 - okay
44:56 - the full type is majors and our standard
45:07 - type is going to be theology pages and
45:21 - we haven't even made this type yet so
45:23 - I'm to test this really I'm gonna have
45:25 - to go to make that I suppose okay
45:33 - and then our ID
45:47 - all right we're gonna need let's let's
45:52 - see I need to go back down and see how
45:54 - we're handling IDs to see if we need to
45:55 - change this but for now I think this
45:57 - will work
45:57 - we do need to add something to make this
46:00 - default word see if I'm jumping around
46:04 - too much please let me know if once I do
46:08 - this and we see if it works I will go
46:10 - back and you'll explain more but I'd
46:13 - rather not explain something that's
46:14 - broken in that way you know I may be
46:17 - misleading someone and I'd rather not do
46:22 - that
46:23 - so our default
46:36 - okay we need to add default type here so
46:41 - let's take our type and since we're now
46:51 - using standard and default there we are
47:03 - okay
47:07 - all right that should work and let's see
47:09 - what's going on with the ID shows our
47:12 - first program ID first second to him
47:28 - okay so we are going to get the the
47:33 - correct idea
47:34 - it looks like that'll be fine we won't
47:36 - have to change anything so I'm gonna
47:39 - save that save that route let's I guess
47:47 - very quickly add theology pages let's
48:01 - see where I I don't think I brought that
48:04 - data in anywhere but if I have already
48:05 - it will save us some time let me just
48:08 - take a second to look
48:16 - so on my other screen I have my
48:18 - WordPress admin panel open if you really
48:23 - want to see that let me know but
48:25 - otherwise I'm just searching for this
48:27 - content within the admin panel
48:41 - this may be under sociated programs now
49:02 - hmm
49:06 - okay I don't think I have this here
49:40 - all right um how much let's see if I
49:47 - have enough time I think we have enough
49:50 - time for this to work
49:59 - maybe or we could just try a different
50:03 - page where I already have all the data
50:05 - how about that
50:24 - okay so first let me see
50:41 - sorry I just quit talking the middle of
50:43 - a sentence okay so I double-checked we
50:51 - do have some data that should work
51:03 - I'm just changing yeah changing the slug
51:08 - so it will work for us okay so I'm gonna
51:13 - test the route just to double-check that
51:16 - it won't work with our current system
51:21 - whoops what it works okay
51:28 - how does it work
51:44 - I guess who's it as the same
51:46 - content-type all right how about this
52:14 - alright here's what I'm gonna do since
52:19 - I'm having trouble finding a suitable
52:23 - piece of content to test this with and I
52:25 - don't want to take up the rest of our
52:27 - time in data transfer which is really
52:31 - boring
52:32 - let's build out the rest of what we know
52:35 - we need and this is this is weird
52:45 - do we really need that
52:56 - now I'm wondering do we really need
53:03 - these this part yet
53:19 - like how did this what I'm wondering is
53:24 - how did this even work
53:35 - all right let me try out a few pages to
53:38 - see what's working and what's not
53:41 - working
53:43 - I forgot these links are not gonna work
53:47 - for us yes we can make sure some links
53:55 - still work
53:59 - okay there's a route that's usually -
54:02 - and that still works I think we did some
54:11 - of these routes
54:43 - okay so here's one that okay so it's
54:51 - it's giving us this page isn't giving us
54:55 - an error but it's not taking us anywhere
54:59 - else so it's giving it this should be
55:04 - the page URLs admissions Franciscan
55:07 - difference undergraduate but what is
55:11 - giving us is the same page as if you
55:14 - went to the URL admissions undergraduate
55:16 - so it looks like it's ignoring that
55:18 - second bit and just giving us the first
55:22 - two so we will need that third you know
55:26 - this third one here and we need a way to
55:31 - handle those routes I wish our URL
55:37 - structure were different but this is
55:38 - what we have so we have to make this
55:40 - work
55:43 - so let's go now all right okay so we
55:47 - have our filter here three parameters
55:50 - page first for him so type second for
55:53 - him okay
56:05 - all right so let's see where I need to
56:11 - go from from here to here
56:24 - all right so we'll start by a copy and
56:26 - pasting you know what we what we already
56:30 - have and then we just need to modify it
56:33 - a bit so we're gonna instead of standard
56:38 - let's say thirdly this it doesn't really
56:49 - matter at this foot so see the ID is
56:57 - gonna be third per am right and the
57:08 - tight
57:24 - the first frame is still under graduated
57:34 - I'm sorry that's it says their friend
57:39 - Heidi say
58:04 - alright let me go go check the live chat
58:08 - quickly see if anybody has any ideas for
58:13 - this Shanxi modification Association AHA
58:18 - Jackson
58:19 - okay five minutes okay let's see let's
58:30 - walk through this and see what we need
58:31 - in this specific case let's check and
58:39 - see where this this content lives at in
58:48 - in WordPress
59:36 - hmm
59:55 - okay so currently this content has has
60:00 - come in under the same content type as
60:05 - the rest of the admissions pages so
60:08 - let's see what rain in admissions pages
60:11 - I think it's up here
60:28 - oh we're not even doing anything okay
60:30 - that makes more sense as to why it
60:32 - worked okay yeah so admissions phages
60:41 - we're working fine without even having
60:44 - to put them in in the object because
60:49 - they fit the default pattern for tight
60:51 - and they use the default component so we
60:57 - didn't need anything in there so since
61:00 - since that was the case it would always
61:04 - just take whatever the last thing is as
61:07 - the ID okay so we are gonna have to
61:17 - change that so let's grab something that
61:20 - probably end up being similar
61:33 - a few departments
61:41 - you
61:44 - all right let's do that and let's put it
61:47 - down here let's say let's get rid of
61:48 - hats right now while we're at it okay so
61:52 - this would be admissions
62:09 - page they page like the admissions pages
62:11 - ID the fault of admissions I don't even
62:19 - know if we have a page that's just
62:22 - admissions
62:34 - oh hey we do
62:40 - okay so yeah so by default it'll just
62:48 - say admissions otherwise what was the
62:52 - other one standard alright so if it's if
63:01 - we don't have a standard ID how do we
63:05 - use that standard ID before with
63:07 - theology right tell G pages just in your
63:13 - type
63:24 - all right with this change let's see
63:26 - what works and what doesn't work okay so
63:30 - that doesn't work now which makes more
63:33 - sense
63:44 - okay
63:59 - all right so that's not working now
64:02 - commissioners case I page the admissions
64:06 - pages
64:12 - - two parameters
64:22 - second program is the ID
65:03 - okay this should be fun it should be
65:05 - getting the right site and then don't ID
65:10 - as I should have a second for him
65:25 - okay so it's not working I guess because
65:28 - of the ID thing
65:42 - so alright so I think it can't handle
65:47 - right now the ID as an object so we're
65:56 - we're just going to change this up a bit
65:58 - so that I can handle that
66:00 - whoops ID and this is gonna be standard
66:16 - and now we can get rid of this and I'm
66:26 - ready
66:33 - okay
66:39 - I'll shred it out now see if we can get
66:43 - this to work
66:55 - No
67:00 - okay so if JD objects
67:13 - during else
67:23 - oh you know what I'm not we need to add
67:28 - in more checks
67:45 - all right let me go back to the live
67:48 - chat here and because my my point over
67:53 - time I ran out
67:55 - okay so let me let me just explain
67:59 - quickly what the next step needs to be
68:01 - and why this isn't working and then I'm
68:04 - gonna go back to the live chat and
68:07 - answer all your questions so what we've
68:09 - done is we've given it the ability to
68:12 - handle the ideas and object and the
68:15 - check for the ID you know dot standard
68:18 - but what happens if there is an ID
68:22 - object but there isn't an ID dot
68:27 - standard so in that case what we need to
68:34 - do here is after we do this this check
68:38 - you know if it is the type of objects
68:42 - and we could probably just put an an
68:44 - here and there is this ID standard that
68:59 - exists then what we want to do is set
69:05 - the type to standard if that's not the
69:08 - case though so we need a else here I
69:18 - guess we already have the else going
69:20 - here so if there is the standard type
69:26 - equals first frame ID okay so this one
69:29 - was checking to make sure we could still
69:30 - use a string as the ID so that's not
69:35 - 100% necessary we could potentially
69:37 - always have an object then that would be
69:40 - okay
69:42 - so just for demonstration purposes let's
69:45 - take this out so let's say else meaning
69:48 - there is no stand there is an object but
69:50 - there's no standard key on that object
69:53 - type is going to equal second / am
70:01 - let's say that and see if I know what
70:06 - I'm doing
70:16 - no and I don't I don't know what I'm
70:19 - doing unfortunately
70:33 - cannot create a feel an undergraduate on
70:36 - type root query
70:47 - he
70:50 - yep not sure what I did there now so we
70:53 - won in the right place here go on the
70:54 - right place here this should just be
70:57 - ignored
71:07 - hmm
71:16 - wait a second the IDS already second
71:21 - program
71:57 - so we're still in there is an ID and
72:02 - then if it is an object and there is
72:11 - standard it does this let's take this
72:21 - back for a second
72:33 - yeah so that wasn't gonna run because
72:35 - we're saying if there is an object so we
72:40 - need we need to pull this out that was
72:47 - my mistake that was bad logic on my part
72:49 - so the idea of what I'm saying works but
72:54 - I put the in statement I combine those
72:57 - if statements and I should not have
72:59 - combined those if statements
73:00 - sufen is an object we're gonna say they
73:07 - were going to check to see if this is a
73:17 - lie if statements then side standard
73:24 - else
73:35 - it's gonna be done I don't need the else
73:43 - right do anything else
73:54 - let's just put let's put the Elson just
73:56 - to be sure all right let's see if that
74:04 - works this is the last thing I'll try
74:05 - whether or not it works I'm done and I'm
74:07 - gonna go to the live chat I'm feeling
74:12 - that point where my brain just needs a
74:14 - break anyway
74:21 - one more hard refresh alright didn't
74:27 - work okay so mission not accomplished
74:34 - today we did get some things working
74:38 - that weren't working before and then I
74:41 - broke some stuff that was working so I
74:49 - guess kind of a win I mean like all in
74:55 - all I think there are more pages working
74:57 - than we had when we started so we can we
75:02 - can be happy about that
75:03 - I wish we would have figured out what's
75:07 - going on here but it's just not gonna
75:10 - happen right now so I'll work on this
75:13 - some more today hopefully I'll have it
75:15 - fixed by tomorrow and if you have any
75:19 - questions please put them in the live
75:21 - chat right now I'm scrolling down
75:23 - through and I will answer everything in
75:26 - the chat here's a question from Blake I
75:32 - need a new laptop what should I get
75:33 - Lenovo ThinkPad vs. Dell XPS 2 1 vs
75:39 - surface pro 2 3 with at least I 5 8
75:46 - gigabytes of RAM
75:56 - mad Duchess says the surface Pro's seems
76:01 - powerful little experience with it but
76:04 - look it feel beautiful Dell was always
76:07 - decent powerful so I'm an HP girl myself
76:10 - I always have leg on Lenovo no matter
76:14 - the specs I had Duchess also says Dell
76:19 - has never let me down I've had four
76:20 - different lenovo's two laptops and two
76:22 - desktop
76:23 - always the same lag issues I'm a bit of
76:27 - a tech geek I have three Dell machines
76:30 - all beautiful and powerful never miss a
76:32 - beat don't have much experience with
76:34 - surface pro my dad has one and it's nice
76:37 - but I don't use it enough to give a full
76:39 - and accurate UX UI opinion on them all
76:42 - right cool that was super informative
76:44 - Matt Duchess thank you for that yeah I
76:48 - don't I've been using Mac's primarily
76:51 - now for about two and a half years so I
76:54 - I don't think I'm I've been out of the
76:58 - PC world for too long the the Microsoft
77:01 - world for too long to really know what's
77:04 - going on there John says I just got a
77:15 - new Lenovo yoga 9 20
77:18 - set up most of yesterday loved it
77:20 - installed Visual Studio code just now
77:22 - impressed love the stylus for my art 16
77:25 - gigs of ram one terabyte solid-state
77:29 - drive that's cool congratulations on the
77:32 - new computer John let's
77:50 - I'm using
78:15 - Oh Nikki I didn't realize you you had
78:18 - switched accounts alright I need to go
78:22 - back through and read some of this now
78:24 - realizing that Nikki switched accounts
78:28 - oh I see now where you told me you
78:35 - switched accounts it all makes sense now
79:11 - see there's some more discussion about
79:14 - different pcs so I'm kind of skipping
79:16 - over a bit
79:26 - hi John says I really think today Jessie
79:29 - you've got my brain fried usually I can
79:31 - follow I can kind of follow lol yeah
79:35 - today my brains a bit fried too it's
79:43 - yeah it's uh this routing stuff has been
79:50 - really tricky every time I think I
79:52 - haven't figured out I find a different
79:54 - URL on the main site that just won't
79:57 - quite fit with what we have so yeah I'm
80:02 - gonna I I may actually like draw some of
80:05 - this out on paper to help me visualize
80:08 - what's really happening that may help me
80:13 - yeah that really meant might help me see
80:16 - the big picture and not mess things up
80:18 - so that's going to be my next step here
80:20 - after I in the stream also says how to
80:25 - use enric in my projects I would I don't
80:30 - remember exactly how I set it up
80:31 - initially cuz it's been a while but
80:34 - check out the instructions on how to use
80:37 - and grow it's not it's just a
80:44 - command-line tool so you would in terms
80:49 - of what you're going with your project
80:50 - nothing in your project would actually
80:53 - have to change at all so this would just
80:58 - run right alongside your project
81:03 - Zubin says what coding style slash
81:05 - guideline do you follow I don't see I
81:07 - see you don't use semicolon your
81:09 - JavaScript I was following his style
81:11 - similar to yours and got a hard time
81:12 - from a co-worker yeah I follow standard
81:15 - jazz I don't like using the semicolons
81:20 - seems to me that if there's a character
81:23 - that doesn't need to be there then it's
81:26 - inefficient to keep putting it there and
81:28 - the circumstances where you actually
81:30 - need a semicolon and JavaScript are very
81:34 - rare if I were to come across one of the
81:37 - circumstances
81:38 - and I would use a semicolon but but I
81:42 - don't need to so some people are very
81:44 - strong opinions about semicolon so I
81:46 - that's probably you know where your
81:48 - co-worker was coming from there
81:52 - personally me I it doesn't matter if you
81:55 - use semicolons or not but if you're
81:56 - working on my projects and you try to
81:58 - commit it'll automatically remove the
82:02 - semicolons so you can do it however you
82:06 - want and then it's going to get turned
82:08 - into the way that the standard way that
82:11 - we're using but yeah the way I see it
82:17 - you can use them you could not use them
82:19 - if there's a certain way you have to do
82:20 - it for a project and yeah follow that
82:22 - way or set up some sort of automatic
82:27 - formatting so that you can type however
82:29 - you want and it'll get formatted the way
82:31 - it needs to be and it says how was your
82:38 - day Jesse pretty pretty good so far that
82:43 - in last night was rough
82:45 - cordelia my little one she's one and a
82:49 - half and she was sick and she just
82:52 - wanted me to cuddle her last night so I
82:54 - took her and she was just coughing and
82:58 - up a lot and then you know he got a baby
83:01 - right next to you trying to sleep was
83:02 - like I'm always waking up trying making
83:04 - sure she's okay you know even when she's
83:07 - still sleeping I'm waking up and I woke
83:11 - up in the middle of the night and felt
83:12 - her leg or leg felt really cold and so I
83:14 - was like freaking out like oh she all
83:16 - right so I'm trying to listen for a
83:18 - breathing and I couldn't hear anything
83:19 - so now I'm really freaking out so then I
83:22 - like grabbed her and she moved and so I
83:26 - was of course very relieved but then you
83:27 - just have that adrenaline rush right so
83:29 - you it's hard to go back to sleep so I
83:32 - didn't get that much sleep I still have
83:34 - my sore throat I don't know if I I
83:37 - haven't been feeling well unless I guess
83:39 - it's been a week now just kind of
83:41 - sorcerer sluggish tired so anyway I woke
83:45 - up kind of late didn't get my workout in
83:48 - but I was able to get into work
83:51 - about quarter after 8:00 a.m. which is
83:55 - pretty early compared to you know
83:57 - everybody else in my in my office here
83:59 - so it's kind of nice to get in like that
84:01 - and yes I guess it's been a not a bad
84:06 - day so far yeah I'm feeling good
84:12 - a little tired but I'm feeling good
84:15 - otherwise thanks for asking how was your
84:17 - day a noble and savage says you sexy
84:28 - bearded coder that's probably the first
84:34 - time anybody's ever said that phrase to
84:36 - me congratulations that's you are the
84:41 - first and I really that's a great way to
84:45 - describe me I think so anyway hey noble
84:55 - savage how's it going
84:56 - [Music]
84:58 - Matt Duchess says brain fry happens but
85:00 - it's good it means we have something new
85:03 - to learn yeah hopefully like when you
85:07 - work out your muscles get sore and then
85:09 - they get stronger hopefully your brains
85:11 - like that too because I'm about to get
85:13 - really stronger in my brain this my
85:17 - brain is super fried right now John says
85:23 - you're gonna have to show us your
85:24 - artwork the big picture oh if I draw
85:28 - something up I will show you but it's
85:31 - it's not gonna be that great my artwork
85:34 - skills are minimal and that's like
85:39 - putting it nicely alright well I think
85:45 - I'm gonna end this dream now and
85:48 - probably take a little break to rest my
85:50 - brain before I go back at this let me
85:54 - think what's going on tomorrow I'm gonna
85:56 - try to stream tomorrow if I can I have a
85:59 - couple of meetings and things going on
86:01 - so
86:03 - I'll try to I'll try my best to fit in
86:06 - the stream tomorrow I'm not sure what
86:08 - time I'll be able to do that yet but
86:12 - hopefully we will be able to have one
86:14 - and you think yeah and that's it for me
86:19 - thank you all so much I really
86:23 - appreciate all the help thanks for
86:25 - hanging in there when I was just
86:26 - confusing my own self and until tomorrow
86:32 - have a wonderful day
