00:44 - um i am i'm just super excited because
00:47 - you have one of the more interesting
00:49 - stories that i've heard
00:50 - uh in in terms of breaking into tech and
00:52 - and all of that but maybe we can start
00:54 - with just a little bit of background um
00:56 - so if you want to tell everybody
00:58 - kind of what you're doing now what where
01:00 - you are in your career right now
01:03 - yeah so right now yeah and i just i like
01:04 - to say yeah it's what the folks in the
01:06 - biz call it non-traditional
01:08 - background but
01:11 - uh yeah yeah uh yeah absolutely but
01:13 - right now currently i am a developer
01:15 - relations manager at
01:17 - apollo graphql uh so for folks who
01:19 - aren't familiar apollo graphql has a lot
01:22 - of like
01:22 - open source tooling and a platform uh
01:24 - that helps folks be successful with
01:27 - graphql surprise prize um yeah so that's
01:30 - kind of where i'm at now it's a very dev
01:32 - advocacy
01:33 - developer relations type focus role
01:35 - which i've slowly transitioned to over
01:36 - the last couple years
01:37 - um before that just uh you know doing a
01:40 - lot of uh development work and
01:42 - things of that nature but yeah that's
01:43 - where i'm at right now yeah for sure
01:45 - and so you know and you've you've grown
01:46 - from a position to you know you you
01:48 - broke into tech a while back
01:50 - how long have you been in the industry
01:51 - now oh so i got my first like
01:54 - professional
01:56 - you know job um uh 2013. so
02:01 - about coming up on like eight years in
02:03 - january it'll be about eight years yeah
02:05 - yeah so
02:06 - um so you know over the course of that
02:08 - eight years you've been able to go from
02:10 - your your first job your entry-level job
02:12 - to where you're now
02:13 - a manager at a company that people have
02:16 - know the name of
02:17 - um you're you're in a position to kind
02:19 - of hire you're growing a team
02:21 - that's that's pretty exciting stuff um
02:23 - and i think
02:24 - maybe a little unexpected given
02:27 - uh your background right so so maybe i
02:30 - think what would be really fun to talk
02:32 - about to start
02:33 - is where did you come from like what
02:36 - happened before you broke into tech
02:39 - uh a whole laundry list of things
02:42 - happened before i broke into tech
02:44 - uh you know it's always tough to like
02:45 - figure out where to
02:47 - start um but i'll say this i
02:50 - i learned how to code i started learning
02:53 - how to code uh when i was incarcerated i
02:55 - was actually serving time doing
02:57 - hard time uh it actually was really hard
02:59 - but uh
03:00 - yeah so um before that i worked a lot of
03:03 - odd
03:04 - and end jobs i dropped out of high
03:05 - school when i was probably about 16
03:07 - years old i think my memory is honestly
03:09 - very fuzzy of anything
03:10 - before uh like my time in incarceration
03:14 - and the reason for that is
03:15 - drug addiction so i suffered
03:18 - from drug addiction i was real deep in
03:21 - the throes of it from about the time of
03:23 - 14 years old
03:25 - until about 22 years old when i was
03:28 - incarcerated
03:29 - and yeah so i worked odd in
03:32 - jobs like line cook i worked for a
03:34 - general contractor for a long time did a
03:36 - lot of construction
03:38 - uh stuff like that uh and then yeah yeah
03:41 - that's pretty much the gist of it before
03:44 - that yeah then i did about seven years
03:46 - uh locked up and that's where i was
03:47 - actually introduced to programming
03:49 - yeah so um i'd actually love to hear
03:51 - about that like
03:52 - how did you get introduced to
03:54 - programming while you were locked up
03:57 - uh so one of the things that happened is
03:59 - like you know i spent about a year in
04:01 - jail
04:02 - um and i had a lot of time for the fog
04:05 - in my brain to kind of clear
04:07 - uh and so when i when i was before the
04:09 - judge and i got
04:10 - sentenced in there like five to seven
04:12 - years uh
04:14 - you know time in prison that was like a
04:16 - like getting hit with a hammer right in
04:17 - your chest
04:18 - and uh you know i i don't really
04:21 - remember what the trip like
04:22 - was getting back to the jail and all
04:25 - that i just remember
04:26 - that night just making a promise to
04:28 - myself i wasn't going to waste a minute
04:29 - of time i was going to take any programs
04:31 - that they made available to me i was
04:32 - going to do whatever i could
04:34 - to make sure that uh when i got out i
04:36 - would only be as far
04:38 - back um you know as set back as possible
04:41 - like yes
04:42 - i'm out of here but maybe i can learn
04:44 - some useful skills and some things to
04:45 - apply when i get out
04:47 - um so i just took a blanket uh
04:50 - uh offering of courses you know i got
04:53 - certified in hvac
04:54 - carpentry electrical work plumbing
04:57 - landscape
04:58 - design uh dog training um
05:01 - what else like all kinds of things
05:03 - literally anything that was offered a
05:05 - cooking program
05:07 - yeah and then uh so what happened was i
05:09 - had like no skill with computer so i
05:10 - actually started out taking like a
05:12 - course on how to use like microsoft
05:14 - office and i took a typing course and
05:16 - and these other type of things and then
05:18 - they offered something on networking so
05:19 - i started to like get into i.t
05:21 - and how computers actually work and how
05:23 - to build them and stuff so it was very
05:24 - cool
05:25 - and then uh just there was this uh one
05:27 - course intro to like
05:28 - either web design or web development i
05:30 - can't remember it was like in all caps
05:32 - on the certificate like
05:33 - just some like weird course and it was
05:36 - yeah it was
05:37 - html css and just a splash of javascript
05:40 - and uh that was i was hooked as soon as
05:43 - i
05:44 - i got my first hello world h1 and i hit
05:47 - refresh in the browser
05:49 - and i saw that update like neurons just
05:52 - started firing i'm like i know how the
05:53 - internet works
05:54 - like uh like i said in the matrix like i
05:57 - know kung fu
05:58 - you know it's like it was pretty cool
06:01 - nah that's great um well so that
06:04 - actually is really fascinating because i
06:06 - um i knew you had learned to code when
06:08 - you were inside but
06:09 - i didn't realize that you had also
06:11 - picked up all those other skills
06:12 - so when you so when you got out
06:16 - did you immediately go into web dev or
06:19 - kind of what was the path
06:20 - between between then and your first job
06:24 - yeah it was a very very hard path it was
06:26 - probably the hardest three years
06:29 - of my life honestly even counting
06:32 - prison time counting uh my time
06:35 - in the throes of drug addiction uh and
06:37 - the reason why is because i
06:38 - had accumulated a lot of valuable skills
06:41 - but uh
06:42 - when you are a felon nobody really wants
06:44 - to hire you
06:45 - you have a lot of other people who have
06:46 - skills as well so
06:48 - whenever i have to check that little you
06:50 - know are you a felon box or have you
06:52 - been convicted of a felony within the
06:54 - last seven years
06:56 - never get the call back never so yeah
06:58 - i'm certified hvac
07:00 - you know i i you know i'm trying to get
07:02 - jobs in welding shops and trying to get
07:04 - jobs
07:04 - i t anything like blanketing across i
07:07 - can't even work at target or mcdonald's
07:09 - like
07:10 - you know and and i think people uh just
07:12 - kind of
07:13 - don't realize like recidivism is so
07:16 - high because folks don't have stability
07:18 - when they get out they get out they want
07:20 - to do better nobody wants to go back to
07:22 - prison it's not like i was in there with
07:23 - a bunch of folks who are like [ __ ]
07:25 - oh sorry shoot as soon as i get out of
07:27 - here yeah oh you know i'm gonna go
07:29 - commit a crime and come right back
07:30 - because this place is fantastic
07:32 - you know that's just like not it you
07:34 - know uh and it got close i almost ended
07:37 - up
07:37 - uh uh going back to dealing drugs
07:40 - because i had no money i had no things
07:41 - but instead
07:42 - i said you know what like screw these
07:44 - companies um they're not gonna give me a
07:46 - chance so i stopped checking the box
07:48 - and what i would do uh is i would work
07:50 - at a job for about three or four weeks
07:52 - until they would do a background check
07:53 - and they'd be like you're one of our
07:54 - best workers but like we have to let you
07:56 - go because you you know you didn't
07:57 - check the box and i'm like well when i
08:00 - check it you don't call me back
08:01 - don't worry i've already applied to like
08:03 - seven other places so i'll go work there
08:05 - for a few weeks
08:06 - and that whole time i was just self uh
08:08 - self-guided learning right i was
08:10 - you know building things uh in
08:13 - in my spare time when i could uh
08:15 - watching things on youtube
08:17 - uh you know just doing a whole bunch of
08:19 - stuff
08:20 - so yeah uh it was pretty rough uh but
08:23 - eventually i landed a job
08:25 - at a company called golden mobile and uh
08:28 - yeah yeah and that was like my first
08:31 - breakthrough
08:32 - yeah was them giving me a chance it was
08:35 - cool
08:36 - but it was a really weird situation too
08:38 - because what happened was they hired me
08:41 - and i worked there for a couple weeks i
08:42 - was doing a fantastic job and like oh we
08:44 - totally forgot to have you fill out the
08:46 - background check
08:49 - here it comes right like here it is
08:51 - again every time it's always like the
08:53 - background check
08:55 - and uh yeah so you know i i
08:58 - i was like okay so i'm left with this
08:59 - choice like you know what do i do here
09:01 - right so
09:02 - uh i was working on this product i just
09:04 - like finished it like i was just like i
09:06 - did i just worked on it like all night
09:08 - i finished it and i brought it to my
09:10 - manager in the morning
09:11 - and i was like hey i completed the
09:13 - project this is the type of work that
09:15 - you can expect from me should you choose
09:16 - to let me stay on
09:18 - my background check you it's going to
09:19 - see that you're going to see i have a
09:21 - record
09:22 - uh i was like but because of that like i
09:24 - have a lot to prove
09:25 - you know and i'm really willing to work
09:27 - extra and it sucks that you you get kind
09:29 - of put into that situation
09:31 - and uh yeah so you know it's just like
09:34 - i had no choice but to overwork myself
09:37 - uh and do that and then it was just
09:38 - weird like they let me stay on but for
09:40 - six months i just felt like everybody
09:42 - was just like looking at me differently
09:44 - um it felt like i had gotten over on
09:46 - them i don't know and
09:48 - i think a lot of that was internal i was
09:49 - internalizing a lot of things
09:51 - stigma about people with records um but
09:54 - it was hard but it was my break it was
09:56 - the thing that got me in there it got me
09:58 - six months of experience
09:59 - uh and had a little something on my
10:01 - resume for you know to to move forward
10:03 - with but yeah it was
10:04 - took about three years from release to
10:06 - first job
10:08 - so so one of the things that i love to
10:10 - talk about on the show and that that i
10:12 - think
10:13 - is um is just so important to focus on
10:15 - is
10:16 - this idea that you know getting into
10:19 - tech
10:20 - is hard right and we're going to talk a
10:22 - little bit more about like how everybody
10:24 - watching can
10:25 - can break into tech a little bit later
10:27 - in the show but for now i kind of want
10:28 - to focus on this idea that
10:30 - like you you had to break and detect not
10:32 - with your technical skills
10:34 - but with a whole range of other skills
10:37 - you know that you had to
10:38 - there was so much perseverance and there
10:41 - was a little bit of
10:42 - kind of ingenuity or craftiness in in
10:45 - getting
10:45 - just through the interview process
10:47 - because you had to check that box
10:48 - um where do you feel like you picked up
10:52 - those skills like what what skills did
10:54 - you use that aren't tech skills that
10:56 - helped you land this first job
10:59 - yeah you you pick up skills from
11:01 - everywhere and i'm so glad that you
11:02 - bring that up because
11:04 - you know a lot of folks feel like if
11:05 - like
11:07 - we focus so much on technical ability
11:09 - that we forget that that's actually a
11:11 - very small part of the day-to-day job
11:14 - like yes you might write a decent amount
11:16 - of code but there's a whole
11:17 - lot of other responsibilities and things
11:19 - that you need to be pretty good at
11:22 - in order to succeed right and so
11:25 - a lot of the things that really helped
11:27 - me was like working construction
11:29 - and as a line cook understanding how to
11:31 - prioritize
11:33 - and organize the workload and make sure
11:35 - that you're doing things in the correct
11:36 - order those are invaluable skills
11:39 - taking a large uh job and breaking that
11:42 - down into smaller pieces that
11:44 - happens every day in the construction
11:46 - world every day you know it goes from
11:47 - like
11:47 - yeah every day if you're framing a house
11:49 - you don't say i'm gonna frame a house
11:51 - it's like first we gotta lay the yeah
11:54 - yeah first we gotta lay down the
11:55 - foundation
11:56 - right we got to set everything up to get
11:57 - the flooring on then we're going to
11:59 - stand up some walls right and then we're
12:00 - going to
12:01 - we're going to uh you know we're going
12:02 - to start working on the second floor and
12:04 - it's like you work up and then it's like
12:05 - eventually before you know you got a
12:07 - roof
12:08 - but you don't start like we build the
12:10 - house right you break it down into its
12:12 - tiny itty-bitty pieces and also
12:14 - i learned a lot of valuable skills about
12:16 - working with other teams other
12:18 - people so as a framer we have to work
12:20 - with the plumbers we have to work with
12:21 - the electricians
12:22 - understand their needs making sure that
12:24 - our part of the job is done in time so
12:26 - that
12:27 - they can come behind and do their part
12:28 - of the job so invaluable skills
12:31 - you learn the same things in the kitchen
12:33 - uh if if you want to see
12:35 - orchestration like at its finest watch
12:38 - line cooks because when you have like an
12:41 - order
12:42 - of you know like a 10 people order come
12:44 - in and everything needs to finish
12:46 - at about the same time and they have
12:48 - different you know different needs as
12:50 - far as like where it's being cooked
12:52 - for how long it needs to be cooked three
12:53 - items on the menu might be the same
12:55 - thing but needed to be done
12:57 - at like different uh temperatures you
12:59 - know we look at like steaks or burgers
13:00 - right
13:01 - and it's like you you have to
13:02 - orchestrate all this not just within
13:04 - your station but with the
13:06 - rest of the team and if you're not
13:08 - communicating you're never going to get
13:09 - that done
13:10 - uh it's never going to be right if
13:11 - you're going in there and you're like
13:12 - well i'm just going to worry about just
13:14 - my little piece and forget the rest like
13:16 - everything's going to fall apart you
13:18 - know you're not going to you're not
13:18 - going gonna succeed in that role
13:20 - uh so i think things like that are
13:22 - extremely transferable
13:24 - yeah and then that kind of br yeah yeah
13:26 - it brings me to my next point which is
13:29 - empathy and understanding uh and this
13:32 - was something that i really
13:34 - started to uh uh internalize
13:38 - and and realize in my time incarcerated
13:41 - uh just understanding like that your
13:44 - perspective of the world
13:45 - is not the center of everything it's not
13:48 - the default that lots of other people
13:50 - have lived
13:50 - experiences uh that are very different
13:53 - from yours
13:54 - and thinking about others whenever
13:56 - you're doing something so that was a
13:58 - huge thing to learn
13:59 - and then lastly uh understanding
14:02 - uh folks like investments in things and
14:05 - then just kind of like
14:07 - being able to to kind of understand how
14:09 - people are feeling like in a in a given
14:11 - situation like
14:12 - in prison you have to know whatever what
14:15 - everyone around you is thinking
14:16 - 24 7. you never get to turn that off
14:19 - right like i need to know if the person
14:21 - next to me has malicious intent
14:23 - i need to know if the person on the
14:25 - other side of me might like
14:26 - be suicidal like there's a lot of like
14:28 - interesting uh
14:30 - dynamics there that in order to just
14:32 - walk through
14:33 - you have to literally know how everyone
14:35 - around you is feeling you have to start
14:37 - learning body language how to pick up on
14:39 - micro
14:40 - cues and micro aggressions understand uh
14:44 - when is a appropriate time to approach
14:46 - folks and when not to and i think like
14:48 - of all the skills that i've learned that
14:50 - has been the most valuable
14:52 - it helped me the most in my career and
14:53 - like what i mean by that like a
14:55 - like actual situation that i can compare
14:58 - in the tech world is
14:59 - let's say uh it's coming up for review
15:01 - time and
15:02 - i think somebody on my team should be
15:04 - getting a raise right like i'm ready to
15:05 - make this case but i kind of want to
15:07 - like
15:07 - start talking to my manager about this
15:10 - now if i walk up to my manager and i can
15:13 - see that their heads down
15:14 - working on something or maybe even
15:16 - slightly frustrated or something like
15:18 - that like
15:19 - it's probably not the best time to be
15:22 - asking these type of questions i
15:24 - one i need to be able to get their full
15:25 - attention and
15:27 - two uh i want to catch them uh when
15:29 - they're probably in a much happier state
15:32 - right like
15:32 - i don't want to to you know you want to
15:35 - be able to like
15:37 - have have as good an opportunity as
15:39 - possible
15:40 - and so sometimes that's reading body
15:42 - language understanding what people's
15:44 - you know uh responsibilities are what
15:46 - their investments are like what you know
15:48 - what are they trying to get out of this
15:50 - and and how can you
15:51 - help show them that by doing this
15:53 - they're going to achieve their goals as
15:55 - well
15:56 - so just understanding people is like
15:58 - paramount
15:59 - you know the more that you can work on
16:00 - that the the better you'll be
16:02 - yeah and and you know when you when you
16:04 - said that i just it kind of
16:06 - connected a couple dots in my head where
16:08 - i was thinking about like you know that
16:10 - that's actually one of the most
16:12 - valuable skills i've seen when you get
16:13 - to any team of
16:15 - a bigger group than you can have a
16:17 - single meeting with right so
16:18 - you know once you cross about 12
16:20 - suddenly you're not
16:22 - having conversations where everyone is
16:24 - on the same page
16:25 - now you're having to have conversations
16:27 - where everybody's got their own sliver
16:29 - of the larger picture
16:30 - and what i think is really interesting
16:32 - about that is that where empathy plays
16:34 - into that and where being able to read a
16:36 - situation or understand someone's
16:37 - motivations
16:39 - like if i want you know if i if i'm a
16:42 - engineer and i want to convince the
16:43 - product team that we should build
16:45 - something a certain way i shouldn't go
16:47 - make a case for
16:48 - why it's a great technical solution
16:50 - that's not their
16:51 - interest that's not their motivation
16:54 - instead i should be
16:55 - as you said think about what they want
16:57 - think about what their
16:58 - concerns are what's stressing them out
17:00 - and if i can frame
17:02 - my technical solution in a way that
17:04 - solves their problems
17:06 - i'm so much more likely to get that
17:08 - decision adopted
17:09 - um 100 100 know the stakeholders
17:14 - and know what their investments are if
17:16 - you're armed with that information
17:18 - it makes it so much easier to to bring
17:21 - up points
17:22 - and to uh raise uh the right questions
17:26 - or the right
17:26 - statements or solutions because you know
17:29 - what everybody is involved in this for
17:31 - and why
17:32 - they care about it empathy right it
17:34 - always comes back to like communication
17:35 - empathy you know those are the to me the
17:38 - most valuable skills that you can
17:39 - possess across any job honestly
17:41 - absolutely especially in tech as well
17:42 - yeah if you're going to work with people
17:44 - being able to read people is going to be
17:45 - like number one no matter what the the
17:48 - underlying job is
17:50 - um yeah and it's yeah but we have to be
17:53 - careful because like there are a lot of
17:54 - folks who that doesn't come as naturally
17:56 - to
17:57 - uh so um you know luckily that is
17:59 - something that i've been able to develop
18:00 - i also did read
18:01 - a lot of books on on these exact topics
18:03 - and stuff as well
18:05 - uh yeah same yeah so it is a a learnable
18:08 - skill
18:09 - you know it's not just either you have
18:10 - it or you don't um uh but yeah there's a
18:12 - lot of folks who
18:14 - um you know might not be as like
18:16 - emotionally attuned
18:18 - and so you know we have to you know uh
18:20 - preface that yeah
18:21 - it could definitely be a lot harder for
18:22 - folks to achieve this but it's
18:24 - definitely a valuable skill if you can
18:25 - get yourself there
18:26 - so you just said something that i'd love
18:28 - to dig into a little bit and i i know
18:29 - that we've got questions coming from the
18:30 - chat uh quincy's doing a great job of
18:32 - cueing those up and we will get to those
18:33 - but uh
18:34 - i want to talk a little bit about this
18:36 - um you said
18:38 - it's a learnable skill and yeah one of
18:41 - the things that
18:42 - i find most fascinating is the way that
18:44 - individual people go about learning so
18:47 - when you're up against learning
18:48 - something that doesn't come naturally to
18:50 - you
18:51 - so for me learning how to have those
18:53 - conversations with people how to be
18:54 - empathetic that was not natural to me it
18:56 - was something i had to put a lot of work
18:58 - into
18:58 - um when you come up against something
19:01 - like that what is your preferred way to
19:03 - learn
19:03 - a new skill well that's really good and
19:07 - it's
19:07 - uh actually kind of situational
19:10 - but i would say most things uh i am more
19:12 - of what's called like a kinetic learner
19:14 - i learn best by doing
19:16 - um and so i'll take input from multiple
19:18 - different avenues whether that be like
19:20 - reading
19:20 - listening to things watching other
19:22 - things but until i start
19:24 - to do it myself it's very hard to put
19:26 - into place
19:27 - um so depending on like what the skill
19:29 - is it can be hard to get yourself into
19:32 - these
19:32 - uh situations so for me when it was uh
19:35 - uh
19:35 - you know i was kind of like forced into
19:37 - learning this because i was incarcerated
19:39 - so i was actually thrown into these
19:41 - situations
19:42 - uh every single day uh which made it
19:44 - basically impossible to not be
19:46 - practicing it but you still have to be
19:48 - very careful so what i would just start
19:49 - doing is applying this to my
19:51 - everyday life and what i mean by that is
19:54 - like
19:54 - having empathy is something that isn't
19:56 - just necessary
19:58 - in in like business communication it's
20:00 - very um
20:01 - uh also very important inside your
20:03 - personal relationships
20:05 - right so i would start applying these
20:07 - practices like
20:08 - okay am i listening more than i am
20:10 - speaking right like
20:12 - i start taking the parts out of these
20:14 - books like the things they want me to
20:15 - try
20:16 - uh and i would essentially just like
20:18 - break that down and just focus
20:20 - on little bits of it and try to apply
20:21 - that until it becomes muscle memory and
20:24 - move on to the next step
20:25 - so in the first case do i listen more
20:27 - than i talk when i'm interacting with
20:29 - folks that's something
20:30 - that i'd like to focus on once that
20:33 - started to become natural the second
20:34 - thing would be
20:35 - okay am i understanding their investment
20:39 - in something like if they're
20:40 - upset about something like do i really
20:42 - know why like yes my friend is upset but
20:44 - why are they upset right and it's like
20:47 - trying to understand
20:48 - that then i would start moving on to
20:50 - things like body language
20:51 - here's a really fun fact um when you
20:54 - enter into
20:55 - a room and you see somebody that you
20:57 - know
20:58 - um and this doesn't mean like whether
21:00 - they like you or dislike you but you can
21:01 - generally tell whether or not they're
21:02 - like
21:03 - excited by your presence because in some
21:05 - form or fashion they will fight
21:07 - gravity that could be raising their
21:09 - eyebrows the shoulders coming up
21:12 - exactly a smile where they actually
21:14 - doesn't go back but it goes out
21:16 - a little they wave literally anything
21:20 - where they fight gravity because gravity
21:22 - is always working against us so if i'm
21:23 - willing to work against gravity
21:25 - that means i'm actually interested
21:27 - enough invested enough to
21:28 - show you that it's subconscious but like
21:32 - 99 of the time it's on point yeah
21:35 - it doesn't mean whether someone is happy
21:36 - to see you or not but if you're my
21:38 - manager and i walk into the room and i
21:40 - see those eyebrows go up it's probably a
21:42 - great time to ask you a question about
21:43 - something that i've been wanting to run
21:45 - by you
21:45 - sure right yeah whereas if i get the
21:47 - straight face and i can tell you're
21:49 - somewhere else and you're not
21:50 - focused it's probably not the best time
21:53 - uh
21:53 - and so that's just like yeah yeah
21:55 - there's like one you know
21:56 - a little bit of it but yeah it's like
21:58 - kind of like understanding that stuff
22:00 - breaking things again breaking things
22:01 - into smaller pieces attacking them one
22:03 - at a time
22:04 - until you build it up is what you would
22:06 - consider to be a base skill that you now
22:08 - possess
22:08 - and moving on to the next thing
22:10 - absolutely um
22:12 - so i so i guess maybe like a good a good
22:15 - thing to move into here is
22:16 - a lot of the folks watching right now
22:18 - have been asking a lot of questions
22:19 - about how to get their first job and so
22:21 - um i've got a few questions here the
22:23 - first one is from mila
22:24 - and mila's asking about um what
22:27 - certificates
22:28 - should should she get to get into the
22:31 - world of software programming and coding
22:33 - um do you do you think that certificates
22:37 - i mean you so you mentioned that you got
22:38 - certified in a handful of things when
22:40 - you were inside
22:41 - um what role have you seen certain
22:43 - certificates play
22:44 - uh in i mean you're hiring now right so
22:47 - like what are you
22:47 - what are you looking for in that yeah
22:50 - yeah i'm hiring now i've been a hiring
22:51 - manager before so
22:52 - there's one thing that i want to uh
22:55 - state here real quick too which is like
22:57 - i have a privileged path into tech and
23:00 - so
23:01 - uh my path and what i've done you know
23:04 - uh will work
23:05 - um but for a lot of folks you know it's
23:07 - just it's
23:08 - a true statement it will be a lot harder
23:10 - for other people
23:11 - than uh myself to break into tech even
23:14 - with a background
23:15 - uh you know we have a big problem with
23:17 - that in the tech industry
23:18 - and uh so i just want to preface that
23:20 - but yes there are still a lot of things
23:22 - that you can do
23:23 - that really do stand to help you stand a
23:27 - better chance of like
23:28 - breaking into tech and uh i think
23:30 - certificates
23:31 - can play a role i think it might be less
23:35 - about certificates and more about
23:37 - until you have work experience you need
23:40 - something to put on a resume
23:42 - people need something to take a first
23:44 - glance at right and now this could be
23:46 - certificates it could be a portfolio
23:49 - that you've built you could take on
23:50 - some freelance projects if you can do
23:52 - that but ideally you want
23:55 - something that you can put right at the
23:56 - top of your resume
23:58 - that's really going to help people get
24:00 - an idea of your
24:01 - current level of skill right and again
24:05 - well this is very hard
24:06 - i i what i would say on top of that is
24:09 - that it's it's your current level of
24:10 - skill and it's also the job that you
24:12 - want like i what i've noticed is that um
24:16 - people tend to get hired for the skills
24:18 - that they put out there so
24:19 - um a lot of times when someone has a
24:22 - broad
24:23 - variety of skills there's a then art of
24:26 - like
24:26 - elevating the ones that you want to get
24:28 - hired for and potentially
24:29 - not emphasizing so if you're currently
24:31 - working in it or like systems networking
24:33 - and you don't want to do that anymore
24:35 - you want to do software you should
24:36 - highlight the certificates around
24:38 - like software engineering and and maybe
24:41 - bury the it stuff because you don't want
24:42 - to get hired as another
24:43 - in another id role absolutely so
24:46 - something yeah
24:47 - i'm so glad that you brought that up so
24:48 - i just want i'll finish this thought
24:50 - real quick and then i want to
24:51 - jump directly into that uh there's
24:54 - studies that show when folks look at
24:55 - your resume they go
24:56 - top left just below that to the left and
24:59 - then over to the right and then
25:01 - everything else below that kind of falls
25:03 - off right and
25:04 - uh i've tested this against myself i do
25:07 - the exact same thing those are the spots
25:09 - that my eyes get drawn to first and
25:11 - that's where people are going to look
25:12 - so i always recommend a two column
25:15 - layout with your most important
25:17 - information your most important
25:19 - experience whether that is a certificate
25:21 - a
25:22 - particular project that you're proud of
25:23 - the one thing that you really want to
25:25 - showcase
25:26 - and then to the right like the next
25:28 - important thing that you think is
25:29 - ancillary to that that will help you get
25:31 - that done
25:32 - i have found this to be an invaluable uh
25:35 - tool to help and then actually yeah to
25:37 - speak to your point
25:38 - not only will i bury things that are
25:40 - irrelevant to the role that i'm
25:43 - currently working at or working towards
25:45 - but i will also put together
25:47 - multiple versions of my resume this is
25:50 - something that i do
25:51 - very often uh maybe i'm willing to take
25:54 - a
25:54 - a role in dev advocacy and a
25:57 - engineering role or particularly a
25:59 - management role
26:00 - you cannot create one resume that you'll
26:03 - be able to submit for all those jobs
26:06 - that are going to highlight the right
26:07 - things because right
26:08 - another piece of advice is keep your
26:10 - resume to one page people
26:11 - rarely go to page two and anything
26:13 - that's on there
26:14 - might as well as not be on there uh and
26:17 - because you only have that one page
26:19 - like you said it's so important to
26:21 - highlight those things for the job that
26:22 - you want
26:23 - so i'll have different cover letters and
26:25 - resumes for each type of role that i'm
26:27 - going to
26:28 - know that i'll apply for it's a little
26:30 - bit of extra work but i find that it
26:32 - really lets me focus in on the things
26:34 - that are going to show off what makes me
26:35 - good for that job
26:37 - yeah where this starts to differ is
26:39 - because if you're just breaking in
26:41 - uh to tech you're not going to have a
26:43 - huge background of work to pull from
26:45 - but you have an entire life of
26:47 - experience to pull from
26:49 - yeah and just how we were talking about
26:51 - the transferable skills
26:53 - you know working at mcdonald's you learn
26:55 - a lot of very valuable skills and it's
26:58 - if you you know when you're putting that
26:59 - on your resume listing out the things
27:01 - like
27:02 - coordinating uh you know between uh
27:04 - multiple
27:05 - uh teammates to to deliver uh you know
27:08 - uh meals you know uh on time right and
27:11 - properly organizing and prioritizing you
27:14 - know uh balancing workloads between
27:16 - you know what i'm doing here or doing
27:18 - there maybe you took on some management
27:20 - responsibilities in these roles like
27:22 - that's all
27:22 - very valuable so don't discount your
27:25 - your life experience it's
27:27 - it's absolutely i look at that yeah my
27:30 - my first job
27:31 - uh i got because i had you know graphic
27:33 - design work and
27:34 - and print printing press pre-production
27:36 - work and all of that
27:38 - helped me build enough like adjacent
27:40 - experience
27:41 - to be able to convince someone to give
27:43 - me a shot on the
27:44 - on the real job right um yeah i think
27:48 - that that's uh that's a really really
27:49 - good point like
27:50 - and the other thing too is you know a
27:52 - certificate you can choose which
27:53 - certificates to get you don't have to
27:55 - um you don't have to do that with
27:58 - an employer's permission you don't have
27:59 - to get hired you can take that
28:00 - certificate
28:02 - similarly with projects so there's a
28:04 - question from humza
28:06 - about how good is the approach of
28:07 - learning a skill by doing projects right
28:09 - away
28:10 - um and so i'm gonna i'm gonna pass this
28:12 - to you but what i'll say up front is
28:14 - if you are trying to get a job doing
28:16 - animation or if you were trying to get a
28:18 - job
28:19 - as a full stack engineer build projects
28:22 - that do
28:23 - that work because i know for me like if
28:26 - if i see that all the work you do is in
28:28 - the service of the job you're applying
28:29 - for
28:30 - i know that you're interested even if
28:32 - it's your first career right
28:33 - um and so yeah so what what uh what
28:35 - would you recommend for someone like
28:38 - certificates projects something else
28:40 - should they freelance
28:41 - where where should people go that's
28:43 - that's a
28:44 - fantastic question i think it is going
28:46 - to boil down a little bit to preference
28:48 - so
28:49 - um i do i do love projects because that
28:52 - allows you to
28:53 - generally create something that like you
28:55 - can mix in your passion so learning is
28:57 - hard
28:59 - and in order to stay motivated it's
29:01 - really nice to be able to mix in like a
29:02 - little bit
29:03 - of things that you like and enjoy uh and
29:06 - so when you learn by doing when you
29:07 - build
29:08 - projects like uh for me there's like a
29:10 - couple things you know that i really
29:12 - like i like longboarding
29:13 - um you know i dabble in video games and
29:16 - stuff like that
29:17 - you know i have like some other
29:18 - interested interests like around
29:20 - collectibles and fun things and like
29:22 - i can take any of those and turn those
29:24 - into a project right or build
29:26 - something around my interests and by
29:28 - doing that
29:29 - uh it's going to help me when i get
29:31 - frustrated you know hopefully that
29:33 - passion can be enough to kind of carry
29:35 - you through
29:35 - uh and see you through to the end it
29:37 - also shows through a bit of your
29:39 - personality which i think goes a long
29:41 - way and and
29:42 - people um i guess undervalue um
29:45 - it's okay to shine a little bit and and
29:48 - and have some individuality
29:50 - uh i like when i see resumes they don't
29:52 - have to be like you know this like big
29:54 - graphic design project but
29:56 - when it's a little bit different than
29:58 - you know just a standard like word doc
30:00 - with bullets listed out i love it
30:01 - because i get to like you know just get
30:03 - a peek at
30:04 - um uh you know someone like putting in a
30:07 - little bit of themselves into things and
30:09 - i think whenever you put a little bit of
30:10 - yourself into something you're gonna
30:11 - invest a little bit more in it
30:13 - and it's nice but i would also say it's
30:15 - like deciding on how you learn
30:17 - it you know some people like structure
30:19 - right like if you like school and you
30:21 - you learn well in a structured
30:23 - environment certificates are probably a
30:25 - fantastic way
30:26 - to continue growing and to build up
30:28 - something to put on the resume
30:29 - if you kind of like to do your own thing
30:31 - and just kind of build stuff and
30:32 - discover things as you go go with
30:34 - projects because you're going to be able
30:36 - to do that
30:36 - um freelancing can be quite a bit of
30:39 - burden
30:39 - because you also have to then understand
30:41 - the freelancing market nothing
30:44 - uh infuriates me more than folks who are
30:46 - branching out they get into freelancing
30:48 - and end up just with these like red flag
30:50 - clients like
30:51 - terrible clients you know and they you
30:53 - know i have friends going through this
30:55 - right now you know
30:56 - the scope creep the project grows it
30:58 - turns from a learning experience into
31:00 - like a doom
31:01 - project you know right yeah i hate to
31:04 - see that so i'm always a bit weary of
31:06 - freelancing but
31:07 - taking on small projects could be a good
31:09 - way and if you need
31:10 - money it's also not a bad option as well
31:13 - you get to add things to your portfolio
31:14 - while you
31:15 - build a little bit of of uh revenue so
31:18 - well
31:18 - and something that will happen whether
31:20 - you wanted to or not when you take on
31:22 - freelance work is you're going to learn
31:24 - things about
31:25 - management about planning about you know
31:28 - being communicative how to like tell
31:31 - people about setbacks in a way that
31:33 - doesn't blow up the relationship
31:34 - all those things those are very valuable
31:36 - skills um
31:37 - very valuable not a super fun way to
31:39 - learn them
31:40 - if you're doing it for the first time
31:42 - with a with a freelance client but
31:44 - uh you will build a whole different set
31:46 - of skills along with that
31:49 - absolutely absolutely but if i'm being
31:51 - honest uh
31:52 - you know to me i think that still one of
31:54 - the best ways this day and age
31:56 - to break into tech is to focus on
31:59 - building
32:00 - a community building a network
32:03 - a lot of folks called i like to say
32:05 - community network rings hollow to me
32:07 - community rings
32:08 - as something that is uh two-way right
32:11 - like you're helping others as they're
32:13 - helping you
32:14 - and learning in public learning in
32:16 - public is another very valuable way to
32:19 - do a lot of those skills that you just
32:20 - mentioned you're learning how to
32:22 - communicate
32:22 - clearly you're showcasing that you are
32:25 - able to break problems down distill them
32:27 - and share them
32:28 - what you've learned with others
32:30 - invaluable skills uh to have in
32:32 - in programming or in general uh and so
32:35 - you know honestly
32:36 - uh while you're looking for jobs you
32:38 - should always be thinking about
32:40 - you know what does my community look
32:42 - like how can i grow that
32:44 - in a in a healthy way right and
32:47 - you know yeah and you know because most
32:50 - of the times the jobs that
32:52 - you really are going to love uh and the
32:55 - the opportunities
32:56 - shine rarely come from uh not it's not
32:59 - always the case there's always
33:00 - exceptions but rarely does it come from
33:02 - you dropping your
33:03 - your application through a contact us
33:05 - form you know
33:06 - um a lot of times it comes fro from a
33:09 - network right like people
33:10 - they understand who you are in the
33:12 - community they've seen the stuff you're
33:13 - doing it lines up with what they're
33:14 - trying to do and then boom
33:16 - you know next thing you know you're
33:17 - interviewing at this this company
33:19 - so it's always something i i recommend
33:21 - too so uh there's a couple questions
33:23 - that are
33:24 - really closely related to this
33:25 - especially given right now
33:27 - where everyone's on lockdown due to
33:28 - coronavirus
33:31 - building a community getting a first job
33:33 - a lot of the advice that that we've seen
33:35 - in previous years is that people getting
33:38 - into their first role should not do it
33:40 - remotely
33:40 - um and i think that there are some
33:43 - arguments there
33:44 - you know there's good reasoning for that
33:45 - like when you are new to something it's
33:47 - really nice to be able to sit next to
33:48 - somebody
33:49 - to have that support network to be
33:51 - surrounded by people doing the same work
33:53 - but that's not an option right now so
33:55 - for uh
33:56 - let's see both uh daniel and hamza are
33:58 - asking
34:00 - what how should that be approach for
34:02 - people who are you know we have to build
34:04 - a community remotely we have to get our
34:06 - first jobs remotely what strategies
34:07 - would you recommend for folks to
34:09 - um to succeed there yeah
34:12 - that's wow what an amazing question
34:16 - yeah so i think the first thing that you
34:18 - want to check and it's it
34:20 - stinks because you know when it's your
34:21 - first time you're not really in like a
34:23 - position of power if you're already
34:25 - in a job and you're comfortable you can
34:27 - be a lot more nitpicky with the
34:29 - companies that you're going to interview
34:30 - with or jobs that you'll take as the
34:32 - first time it can be hard but
34:33 - i want to say you want to look out for
34:34 - like uh what folks will call like red
34:37 - flags around like remote work and
34:39 - condition or
34:40 - is this a company with a track record of
34:42 - already working with juniors or will you
34:44 - be the first
34:45 - junior developer to come on that's one
34:48 - question
34:48 - alone that if you get the answer to that
34:50 - can be a strong indicator
34:52 - now if you are the first junior but
34:54 - they're a company who's already been
34:56 - working remotely for a lot of time and
34:57 - they've built up those practices you're
34:59 - probably safe but
35:01 - if it's a company who's just got gone
35:03 - remote because of covid
35:05 - and they don't have a track record of
35:07 - onboarding juniors already
35:09 - it's probably going to be pretty
35:10 - difficult doesn't mean it won't work
35:12 - it just means that's something that you
35:14 - might want to consider
35:16 - and i think uh this circles back to if
35:18 - you get in a habit of learning in public
35:20 - uh one thing that's gonna come along
35:22 - with that is asking a lot of questions
35:24 - you know as you learn in public you're
35:26 - not just gonna share what you learned
35:27 - but you're gonna start to ask your
35:29 - community questions
35:30 - to to learn better and if you find
35:33 - yourself in a position
35:34 - a remote first company because it's your
35:37 - first
35:38 - junior development job over communicate
35:41 - and i
35:42 - you really can't over communicate but a
35:44 - lot of folks want to hold back for
35:46 - lack of feeling you know like they
35:48 - should know something or they should
35:50 - uh uh not you know save questions and
35:53 - ask them all at one time
35:55 - i say don't make find find the people
35:58 - in the company who always seem awesome
36:01 - about answering your questions there's
36:03 - going to be people in any company
36:05 - no matter how good or bad it is that
36:07 - like to help folks
36:09 - find them and ask them just constantly
36:11 - ask them questions you're not bothering
36:13 - them
36:14 - they love it that's what they're there
36:15 - for they want to help you
36:17 - uh you know so i would say definitely
36:20 - communicate early and communicate often
36:24 - and this goes like even further don't
36:26 - write up this whole
36:27 - pull request right and make a bunch of
36:29 - changes push it and then ask for a
36:31 - change
36:31 - right as soon as you create the branch
36:33 - push it up and open a pull request
36:35 - each commit push that up and ask for
36:38 - feedback
36:39 - early and often that is like my number
36:41 - one piece of advice for folks
36:43 - and and remember you can set a pull
36:45 - request on github in draft mode which
36:46 - means this isn't ready yet i'm just i'm
36:49 - working on it and that
36:50 - lets people see what you're doing uh
36:52 - which i i i love that advice personally
36:54 - like
36:55 - one of the things that i really enjoy
36:57 - about people who i'm i'm working with in
36:59 - a
36:59 - like a lead capacity where i'm kind of
37:01 - helping level them up is
37:03 - when there's that constant seeking of
37:06 - feedback if
37:07 - if somebody sends me 1500 lines of code
37:09 - and they're like can you give me some
37:10 - feedback on this i'm like
37:12 - i mean i can but it's not going to be
37:14 - nearly as good as if you'd sent me 100
37:15 - lines of code
37:17 - um and so it's you know it's definitely
37:19 - one of those things that
37:20 - you can optimize your environment right
37:22 - if you if you
37:23 - think about how it would feel to be on
37:25 - the other end of this like
37:27 - would you rather somebody has a problem
37:31 - doesn't tell you about it gets the
37:33 - company in trouble and then
37:35 - like comes to you later and says hey i
37:36 - know that our team's on the hook for
37:37 - this thing but i didn't do it because i
37:39 - wasn't sure how
37:40 - here's my problem i know it's due today
37:42 - or would you rather somebody said
37:44 - hey i need to work on this and i'm not
37:46 - quite sure can you help me unstick this
37:48 - so that i can get started right there's
37:50 - there's that like
37:51 - i would much rather get asked early so
37:53 - that the team gets all their work done
37:55 - on time
37:55 - right absolutely yeah without a doubt
37:58 - it's just the cognitive overhead uh it's
38:00 - a two-way street like
38:02 - if you build things up it becomes a
38:04 - large investment and that yes and
38:06 - it's very hard for people to have the
38:09 - resources
38:10 - or energy to respond to that large
38:13 - investment whereas if it's coming
38:15 - through bite size
38:16 - and like a constant flow it's a lot
38:19 - easier right like the feedback loop is
38:21 - much smaller
38:22 - much tighter it's i can answer one or
38:24 - two questions
38:25 - 15 times throughout a day much easier
38:28 - than i can take an
38:29 - hour to two hours to like review like a
38:31 - very large pr
38:33 - if that makes sense that absolutely
38:35 - makes sense yeah i mean
38:36 - and that's like that's how i think a lot
38:38 - of us function is
38:39 - as you know senior devs managers we
38:42 - we get ourselves in a position where we
38:44 - try to be quickly doing little bits of
38:47 - work to move the whole team forward if
38:48 - we have to drop everything to focus on
38:50 - one effort the rest of the team
38:51 - bottlenecks up
38:52 - um and so that's you know it's it's also
38:55 - like
38:56 - these are the skills like these are the
38:57 - things when i see somebody learning the
38:58 - skill when i see somebody getting
39:00 - really good at sending pull requests at
39:02 - you know
39:03 - sending like small scopes of work
39:05 - instead of sending me
39:06 - everything all at once that's when i
39:08 - start to think like this person's get
39:10 - they're getting it they're going to go
39:11 - somewhere like
39:12 - let's get them on the fast track right
39:13 - so it's also a great way to advance in
39:16 - your career
39:17 - absolutely uh yeah because yeah it just
39:21 - showcases
39:21 - that uh you're starting to understand
39:23 - you know feedback loops what it means to
39:27 - think about other people's time in
39:28 - relation to the things that you have to
39:30 - do
39:30 - um and it also just shows yeah your
39:32 - willingness to communicate and
39:34 - it's just it's just such a valuable
39:36 - skill you know absolutely i
39:38 - can't state it enough but yeah and so
39:40 - that that willingness to communicate i
39:42 - also think
39:43 - builds confidence it give it when you
39:46 - ask a question and you get an
39:47 - answer that's a that's a small
39:49 - confirmation that says
39:51 - i'm this is okay and when you do that a
39:53 - lot exactly
39:54 - it builds that confidence it gets that
39:56 - ball rolling and actually i'm going to
39:57 - ask a question to you
39:58 - uh from elliot uh because i think it's
40:00 - related elliott says i'm hitting a lot
40:02 - of walls where i get to the final round
40:04 - of an interview
40:05 - then i keep getting told that i'm too
40:06 - junior or need more experience
40:08 - what would you advise for someone to do
40:10 - in this position
40:12 - yeah uh that's really tough so honestly
40:15 - elliott i feel that that
40:17 - is more on the company that it is on you
40:20 - uh i feel a lot of times companies
40:22 - position roles as junior
40:24 - and then you look at the requirements
40:26 - for the role and what they want
40:28 - out of it and it's not quite there um
40:30 - but yeah
40:31 - it is it's difficult but if you want to
40:34 - improve that there are a couple things
40:36 - that you can do and so to me this comes
40:38 - back to like
40:39 - projects right um this is why i like
40:42 - projects actually that's how i got the
40:43 - job at major league soccer um
40:46 - i had started to understand uh uh
40:49 - that like i was pushing you know outside
40:51 - of front end rolls a lot of stuff i had
40:53 - done previously had been front end
40:55 - i got very curious about like the uh api
40:57 - gateway layer and like back end work and
41:00 - kind of what that looked like so
41:01 - i set up like a microservices
41:03 - architecture i took some time i tried to
41:05 - invest in docker and understand like how
41:07 - you would architect
41:08 - having multiple different apis all
41:10 - talking to one
41:12 - and then turns out that was like exactly
41:14 - what major league soccer was looking for
41:16 - right they wanted a full stack developer
41:18 - who knew really how to work from the api
41:20 - gateway down but understood
41:22 - at least what was happening a little
41:24 - step further so i think it's
41:26 - uh it's also a matter of being able to
41:29 - talk about things and so um i always
41:32 - like to think about things as like
41:34 - drip learning like you hear about
41:35 - different learning styles like shallow
41:37 - learning which is like you know know a
41:38 - little bit about everything
41:40 - or t learning know a little bit about
41:42 - everything dive deep in one thing
41:44 - i'm a big fan of drip learning like only
41:46 - learn what you need to know
41:48 - to do like the very next step and
41:50 - sometimes you'll learn a little bit and
41:52 - sometimes you'll get down further but
41:53 - you have this shallow pool and some
41:55 - things just to kind of drip
41:56 - all over the place yeah and a way to
41:59 - achieve that
42:00 - a really good way to achieve that is to
42:02 - focus on hows
42:03 - or sorry on whys over house and what i
42:06 - mean by that
42:07 - is like when you hear about a new
42:09 - framework instead of stopping everything
42:11 - you do
42:12 - spin up a new project and start building
42:14 - something with it like savelle or
42:15 - something
42:16 - like that step back and say well what is
42:18 - the problems felt is trying to solve why
42:20 - was it created
42:22 - you know what is the difference between
42:23 - it and react and why would i pick it one
42:25 - over the other
42:27 - that information is way more valuable
42:30 - because anybody's going to be able to
42:33 - pick up spell and eventually learn how
42:35 - to use it right not everybody
42:37 - understands why you pick spell
42:39 - or why you would want this or why you
42:41 - pick a microservices architecture over a
42:43 - monolith and what are the benefits of
42:45 - those two things right
42:46 - right and so i think i you know i spent
42:48 - a lot of time there's something like
42:49 - thoughtworks has something called a
42:51 - technology radar
42:52 - uh which is a really good like quarterly
42:55 - newsletter where they cover
42:56 - all of the technologies that are like
42:58 - emerging
42:59 - uh and what they were built for and the
43:01 - problems that they solve and stuff like
43:03 - that and
43:04 - sometimes your lack of experience is
43:06 - really just like they want to hear like
43:07 - more uh you be able to speak more
43:10 - capably
43:11 - about given topics it doesn't
43:13 - necessarily mean that you don't
43:15 - know something enough right it's just
43:17 - that
43:18 - you know you don't know the things you
43:20 - need to know
43:21 - to know what you would need to learn god
43:23 - that's a lot but that
43:24 - that's essentially what it is well and
43:27 - and you know i'll
43:28 - i'll add to that by saying one of the
43:30 - things that stands out to me when i'm
43:32 - interviewing somebody early career is
43:35 - whether or not they give a strong
43:37 - impression
43:38 - that like i don't expect juniors to know
43:41 - much like we're we're hiring them in
43:43 - their first role like you're you're
43:44 - supposed to have like bare minimum we're
43:45 - going to teach you everything else
43:47 - so i'm not looking for them to know
43:49 - everything i'm looking for them to give
43:51 - me that distinct impression
43:52 - that they know they don't know but
43:54 - they're very sure they can find out
43:56 - and and if i get that sense that that
43:59 - someone
43:59 - is really like the self-starter
44:02 - they are they're confident in their
44:04 - ability to learn they believe that
44:06 - any knowledge is accessible to them if
44:09 - they get the time and energy to work on
44:10 - it
44:11 - right those are the types of people that
44:13 - really stand out to me and i think that
44:14 - goes back to that confidence
44:16 - right like if if you come off as
44:19 - not confident in your skills you're
44:21 - early in your career you don't have to
44:22 - be confident in your skills but be
44:23 - confident in yourself
44:25 - be confident in your capability to
44:27 - expand and grow
44:29 - that i can smell that a mile away and
44:31 - i'm always looking for people who do
44:32 - that
44:33 - absolutely i'm looking for that all the
44:35 - time as well because honestly when
44:37 - you're junior we don't have a lot to go
44:39 - off you know there's not a lot of work
44:42 - history for us to examine
44:44 - uh so we're really left with behavioral
44:46 - questions
44:47 - right like do you understand uh how you
44:50 - would do things differently given a
44:51 - reset on certain situations and they
44:53 - don't have to be related to code
44:55 - right but it's like all we're left with
44:57 - is like
44:58 - do they understand uh ways
45:01 - to learn quickly right not necessarily
45:05 - understand and master something quickly
45:06 - but how to get the information
45:08 - quickly that's the difference um and
45:11 - yeah and and
45:11 - you know behaviorally like are they
45:14 - comfortable with critiquing themselves
45:16 - retroing the things that they've done
45:18 - and able to understand how they would
45:20 - change things to do
45:21 - better next time and those are
45:24 - invaluable if you
45:25 - if you present me with those two things
45:27 - in an interview it's like yeah i
45:29 - absolutely want you on my team this is
45:30 - somebody who's going to come in with a
45:32 - fresh set of eyes
45:34 - they're going to look at the things that
45:35 - we've got going on you know they're
45:36 - going to be
45:37 - offering us already insightful
45:39 - information from the start
45:40 - i can trust that as they learn and grow
45:42 - they're going to be reflective of that
45:44 - and figure out what they can always be
45:45 - doing to
45:46 - improve and they're going to go out and
45:47 - seek that information now i'm going to
45:49 - dump it on to you like just keep
45:51 - anything onto you that you want but it's
45:53 - still very cool to see
45:55 - uh people have the skill and ability to
45:57 - do it to themselves because you know
45:58 - what there
45:58 - are some times when maybe you know you
46:01 - can't get to that question
46:02 - fast enough and they're eager to pick
46:04 - something up and boom off they go with
46:05 - it yeah
46:06 - and that's growth right like when what i
46:08 - love to see is when you get somebody who
46:10 - comes in
46:11 - and they start out they're junior
46:12 - they're fresh they don't know anything
46:13 - but as you dump that information on them
46:16 - you never have to dump that same
46:18 - information twice you start to see them
46:19 - answer questions and the things that
46:21 - you've taught them they're
46:22 - they're quick to step up and and pick up
46:24 - those issues
46:25 - and that to me is those are the signs
46:28 - that really show me that somebody's
46:29 - gonna grow well
46:30 - um and i you know i'd love to i'd love
46:33 - to see that
46:34 - uh so i absolutely i have another
46:36 - question for you
46:37 - that uh we're gonna loop it back a
46:38 - little bit because you made a mention
46:40 - about you know people who are looking
46:43 - for their first careers
46:44 - they don't have the luxury and the
46:45 - privilege of being as choosy
46:47 - as someone who's later in that program
46:49 - and and they
46:50 - might just have to take the job that's
46:51 - available not the job they want
46:53 - so uh so turth is asking if you interned
46:56 - at a company that doesn't pay well but
46:58 - you're getting exposure to
47:00 - to frameworks and tools and and
47:02 - practices um
47:04 - should you should you be looking to quit
47:06 - should you be looking to
47:08 - do so like how do you how do you take
47:10 - that
47:11 - situation and turn it to your advantage
47:14 - instead of getting stuck
47:16 - yeah and again this is really tough
47:19 - because it depends on
47:20 - where you land right but absolutely one
47:22 - thing that i really appreciate with
47:24 - different companies is when
47:26 - uh you have a little bit of time to
47:29 - learn actually so here's something that
47:30 - i do um i have like a 70 30 rule
47:34 - i dedicate 70 of my time at a job
47:36 - towards the actual job and the goal
47:38 - at hand and i dedicate about 30
47:40 - sometimes a little less in
47:42 - in crunch time towards growing
47:45 - and learning as a developer so even if
47:48 - the time isn't technically allotted to
47:49 - you but kudos to all you companies out
47:51 - there that are giving folks the ability
47:53 - and time to learn
47:54 - uh we appreciate you uh but yeah if
47:57 - you're not giving it you have to kind of
47:58 - give it to yourself
47:59 - uh so when you join a company and you're
48:01 - starting in that role
48:03 - never come in there at 110 because what
48:06 - happens is that becomes your baseline
48:08 - and as soon as you set a baseline of 110
48:11 - that becomes expected of you and then
48:13 - when it becomes crunch time now they
48:15 - need 130
48:16 - but you've got nothing left to give
48:18 - right you're already at everything
48:20 - so i really come in at about 70 80
48:22 - productivity and i'm
48:24 - always dedicating the rest of that time
48:26 - to learning
48:27 - and to growing and then leaves me a 20
48:30 - bandwidth to push in crunch times when
48:32 - we really need to get things
48:34 - done it's going to help you prevent
48:35 - burning out spectacularly
48:37 - uh and it's going to allow you that time
48:40 - that you need to always be growing and
48:42 - doing your career now you might find
48:43 - yourself in a situation where it's kind
48:44 - of too late you've already been given
48:46 - 110
48:48 - uh and you don't really feel like you're
48:50 - growing and then this comes really down
48:52 - to like a work-life
48:53 - balance time uh management situation
48:56 - where
48:57 - it's like you have to figure out a way
48:59 - to advance your skill set
49:02 - without you know again burning yourself
49:05 - out hurting yourself some things that
49:06 - you could do or trying to switch teams
49:08 - maybe the team that you're on you feel
49:10 - like you've really learned it you're
49:11 - kind of stagnating there are there other
49:13 - teams in the company that you could join
49:15 - who are doing some of the things that
49:16 - you're interested in
49:17 - maybe that's like moving from a front
49:18 - end to a back end role or like you know
49:21 - trying to branch out there uh getting
49:23 - involved in
49:24 - open source like or uh could be a good
49:27 - way if you have the bandwidth to start
49:28 - experimenting with things on a small
49:30 - scale
49:31 - uh meetups like now everything is
49:33 - virtual
49:34 - so meetups and and talks are a good way
49:37 - to get exposure
49:39 - to different topics that thoughtworks
49:41 - technology radar will kind of keep you
49:43 - abreast
49:44 - of everything that's going on and then
49:45 - just dabble but just be careful be very
49:48 - very careful of burnout the first like
49:50 - two years of my development career and
49:53 - it really did
49:54 - took its toll on me physically and
49:55 - mentally i was burnt out
49:57 - suffered deeply from depression i was
49:59 - going like 18 hours
50:00 - you know a day super unhealthy super
50:03 - super unhealthy
50:04 - i was just in a place i was in a digital
50:06 - agency
50:08 - after gold mobile i went to my first uh
50:11 - digital agency role in new york city i
50:13 - thought you know i'd made it
50:15 - i'm in the city ma and uh so yeah
50:18 - yeah uh i thought i'd made it but anyway
50:21 - it turned out to just be like a
50:22 - developer mill
50:23 - um you know they they impossible
50:25 - deadlines the technology stack
50:27 - never changed so just after you know six
50:30 - months it just
50:31 - felt very like repetitive i felt
50:33 - stagnated
50:35 - uh and it was hard it was hard to do
50:37 - that so i just like
50:38 - you know i would spend a little bit of
50:39 - time i had on my commute just trying to
50:41 - understand
50:42 - uh the housing wise and yeah so it's
50:45 - just like
50:45 - you know it's about optimizing and again
50:49 - focus on house or wise over house
50:52 - because
50:54 - your next role you'll probably learn
50:55 - those things like i i might not expect
50:58 - you to know
50:59 - docker but i would expect you to
51:01 - understand what docker is
51:02 - and why we would use docker right and
51:05 - like i won't expect you to
51:07 - you know know the particular frameworks
51:09 - that we're using for an api but
51:11 - i would expect you to just be able to
51:12 - talk about apis in general and like you
51:15 - know some some basic questions
51:17 - and and uh problems that you might face
51:19 - when building an api
51:20 - so it's like really just like knowing um
51:23 - why someone
51:24 - picks a technology or would choose it is
51:27 - in my opinion way
51:28 - better than being uh very deep and
51:31 - specific into one thing it also kind of
51:32 - funnels you into
51:34 - like uh you know a particular silo right
51:37 - like
51:38 - that's all you're known for right like
51:40 - you know you become
51:41 - d3 person or something like that maybe
51:43 - you want to learn something else but
51:45 - that door kind of gets closed off for
51:47 - you like you were saying if you have it
51:48 - on there
51:49 - all anyone wants to send you is it jobs
51:51 - right
51:52 - um yeah when you establish expertise
51:55 - that's that's the thing
51:56 - like if you if you become the expert on
51:58 - a thing then
51:59 - people are gonna naturally send you that
52:02 - work because you know
52:03 - what we're all looking for is someone
52:04 - who's going to make our problems
52:05 - disappear so if i have an i.t problem
52:07 - and you show me that you're an i.t
52:08 - expert that's what i'm going to give you
52:09 - that's what you're going to do so if you
52:11 - don't want that work you kind of have to
52:13 - keep that off the resume you got to keep
52:15 - that off the off the radar you know yeah
52:18 - i would say if you have the ability to
52:21 - my biggest takeaway would be
52:22 - let you know if you have a good
52:23 - relationship with the person who is your
52:25 - manager
52:25 - in turn or otherwise let them know like
52:28 - let them know the problem that you're
52:29 - facing hey
52:30 - i feel stagnated right now if they are
52:33 - not receptive to that
52:35 - then yeah you definitely want to be
52:36 - somewhere else anyway right but now
52:38 - there's no guilt there there's no
52:40 - nothing
52:40 - you you've done that right but if you're
52:42 - underpaid let your manager know right
52:45 - like
52:45 - you know if they try to help you out and
52:46 - work with you awesome if they don't then
52:48 - yeah it's time
52:49 - time to look elsewhere so then circle
52:51 - back to the beginning of setting up a
52:52 - resume
52:53 - for the job you want figure out the the
52:57 - whys of those technologies and now
52:59 - you're armed to go into interviews and
53:00 - talk about them
53:01 - absolutely all right i'm going to ask
53:03 - you one last one because i think this is
53:06 - this is going to be a good point to end
53:07 - on um so
53:09 - blahya asks how do you learn to code and
53:12 - program if you don't know enough about
53:13 - computers uh
53:14 - it looks like while you didn't grow up
53:16 - with computers and i know that you also
53:18 - didn't grow up with computers i spotted
53:20 - that question in the chat i was going to
53:21 - ask you if we could get to that in the
53:23 - end yeah so i never
53:24 - had a computer in my home uh growing up
53:27 - uh
53:28 - and i would say like i'm not normally
53:30 - one to say like
53:31 - learn the fundamentals uh you know
53:33 - before you go but
53:34 - having a basic understanding of how
53:37 - computers work
53:38 - being able to like use like a keyboard
53:41 - like i forget what they call it like the
53:43 - the proper you know typing like i used
53:44 - to two fingers like this and like if
53:47 - you're in a situation where that's all
53:48 - you can do then yes of course that's all
53:50 - you can do
53:51 - but if you're capable absolutely like
53:54 - learn how to type uh so that you don't
53:56 - have to be
53:57 - looking at the keyboard every two
53:58 - seconds like once you understand the
54:00 - basics of computers and you've
54:02 - internalized that
54:03 - it opens up the ability to focus on
54:06 - programming right because you're right
54:07 - now you're trying to learn
54:08 - two things at once right and that's
54:10 - always going to be a problem so let's
54:12 - break it down into smaller pieces
54:14 - let's attack the things let's put them
54:16 - in order and let's attack them one by
54:18 - one
54:18 - get comfortable on a keyboard then get
54:20 - comfortable with how computers in the
54:22 - internet works
54:23 - and you don't have to go deep again
54:24 - again just why how does this work like
54:27 - the basics of the internet how does that
54:29 - work
54:30 - and start from there and then get your
54:33 - way into programming
54:34 - it doesn't mean you can't be reading
54:36 - blog posts about programming and doing
54:38 - stuff like that and messing around but
54:39 - invest the time up front
54:41 - to really get comfortable with computers
54:44 - because
54:45 - you're trying to make it your full-time
54:47 - job right
54:48 - and again you don't have to know you
54:50 - don't have to know how to drive a car to
54:51 - be a mechanic
54:52 - at all you really don't like you could
54:53 - be an amazing mechanic and not know how
54:55 - to drive a car
54:56 - um but you can't be a mechanic and not
54:59 - know how to use your tools
55:00 - right and i think that that is a
55:03 - difference right like
55:04 - in this case a keyboard is a tool and
55:06 - you got to be proficient with it if you
55:08 - want to be a good developer
55:10 - one way that i've that i've heard this
55:11 - described that i really like is
55:13 - um you know when you are writing code
55:17 - you you're not just thinking about you
55:19 - know you're thinking about the problem
55:20 - that you're trying to solve you're
55:21 - thinking about the
55:22 - the code that you're writing you're
55:23 - thinking about what you're typing into
55:25 - the keyboard like you said
55:26 - so when you see somebody who is really
55:30 - proficient at this
55:31 - they've moved to what is called
55:32 - unconscious competence
55:34 - right where they're no longer thinking
55:36 - about that and and we're all
55:37 - unconsciously competent at something
55:40 - maybe we
55:41 - can you know sing a song without
55:43 - thinking about the melody maybe we
55:44 - are you know we can uh like juggle a
55:47 - soccer ball
55:48 - maybe we can you know anything like you
55:51 - any sports that you can play without
55:52 - really thinking about where you're
55:54 - where your body is moving um any
55:56 - anything like if you can type without
55:58 - having to think about your fingers and
56:00 - you can just say you know you're you're
56:01 - typing like you speak
56:03 - each one of those things removes a
56:05 - cognitive load from the work that you're
56:07 - doing and it lets you just
56:08 - play and that's where excellence can
56:10 - really be born if you have to think
56:12 - about every step in the way
56:14 - you're just you're gonna have so many
56:16 - blockers it doesn't mean you can't but
56:17 - it's gonna
56:18 - it's gonna slow you down it's gonna slow
56:20 - you down greatly it's gonna frustrate
56:21 - you
56:22 - uh you know it's it's gonna force you to
56:24 - split your
56:25 - the the like the cognitive load you have
56:28 - in your head
56:28 - amongst multiple things yeah it's like
56:31 - it's you know i'm not
56:32 - going to go too deep into it but the
56:33 - thing i love about types types
56:35 - allow me to take so much state and throw
56:38 - it out of my head and rely on something
56:40 - else
56:41 - to provide that information for me so i
56:43 - can focus only on the problem at hand
56:44 - not remembering
56:46 - what if this is a freaking string or
56:49 - number or whatever
56:50 - right like i don't have to worry about
56:52 - that i can just move forward
56:53 - focus solely on the goal yeah so as many
56:55 - things as you can
56:56 - turn into what did you call that sub
56:59 - unconscious unconscious competence
57:01 - i love that unconscious competence all
57:04 - the things
57:05 - folks yeah and this is a it's a it's a
57:08 - theory that you can read on if i can't
57:09 - remember who
57:10 - came up with it but it's uh like an
57:11 - educational theory when you first
57:13 - start learning something you go from
57:15 - unconscious incompetence which is where
57:17 - you don't know that you don't know
57:18 - something
57:19 - then you go to conscious incompetence
57:21 - which is when you realize that there's a
57:22 - thing you don't know
57:24 - and if for somebody who's just starting
57:25 - programming that's probably where you
57:27 - feel you know that you could program but
57:29 - you're not sure how to make it happen
57:31 - then you study you train you get to
57:33 - conscious competence
57:34 - where if you think about it if you focus
57:36 - you can do the job
57:38 - and then where mastery comes in is
57:40 - unconscious competence where you're able
57:41 - to do the thing without thinking
57:43 - this is where somebody who can play a
57:45 - piano by ear or
57:46 - somebody who you know you like anything
57:48 - that you can just do
57:49 - if you can walk and chew gum and you
57:52 - don't have to think about either of
57:53 - those things
57:54 - you are unconsciously competent at
57:55 - walking and chewing gum right
57:57 - absolutely um
58:01 - well kurt so we are we are at the end of
58:03 - our time so thank you again so much for
