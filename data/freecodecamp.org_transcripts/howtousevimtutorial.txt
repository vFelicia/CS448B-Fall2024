00:00 - hello I am them girl any love talking
00:02 - about tech this video is for those of
00:05 - you who are new to them if you intend to
00:08 - program in your career one of the best
00:10 - text editors to use as them it is
00:13 - efficient because you no longer need the
00:15 - mouse to move your cursor it's
00:17 - ubiquitous because it can be found on
00:20 - virtually all UNIX systems and it's very
00:22 - helpful because it pushes programmers to
00:25 - think twice before coding I'll be going
00:27 - over some of the commands I use
00:29 - frequently about how to insert navigate
00:32 - search edit and exit in vim so that by
00:36 - the end of this video you'll be ready to
00:38 - edit your code there are quite a few
00:42 - commands I'll be going over so if it
00:44 - gets overwhelming don't worry I have it
00:46 - all written down for you just sit back
00:49 - and enjoy the show now let's try to open
00:53 - my file called index is before I can
01:02 - start typing I have to go into insert
01:04 - mode you know I can't just unconsciously
01:06 - knock code out like an atom or sublime
01:09 - there are several ways of going into
01:12 - insert mode the most common is lowercase
01:15 - I it allows me to start typing before my
01:18 - cursor to get out of the insert mode I
01:22 - simply press escape if I want to type
01:26 - after my cursor I use a to type at the
01:32 - beginning of the line I use capital I
01:35 - and capital a will let me start typing
01:40 - at the end of the line lowercase o will
01:45 - let me type in a new line after my
01:47 - cursor and capital o in a new line
01:53 - before my cursor now that we know how to
01:58 - go into insert mode let's talk about the
02:00 - different ways you can navigate through
02:01 - the spot Jiji brings my cursor to the
02:05 - beginning of the file to get to the end
02:09 - of the file I'll use cap
02:10 - gee if I want to move my cursor to the
02:15 - end of this line I'll use the dollar
02:18 - sign and to get to the beginning of the
02:21 - same line I'll use 0 an opening curly
02:26 - bracket will take us to the next space
02:28 - of a paragraph in an upward Direction
02:31 - like so and a closing curly bracket will
02:37 - do the same but in a downward direction
02:43 - now if I want to move right words within
02:48 - this line W will take me to the next
02:53 - word lowercase W that is and capital W
03:00 - will take me to the next word separated
03:02 - by a space now if I want to move left
03:09 - words lowercase B will take my cursor to
03:12 - the last word and capital B will take my
03:19 - cursor to the last word separated by a
03:21 - space okay now let's try searching
03:26 - through our file lowercase F finds the
03:30 - closest character of your choice to the
03:33 - right of the cursor so say I'm looking
03:36 - for lowercase a F a and I found a
03:41 - capital F does the same thing except
03:44 - that it looks to the left so let's look
03:47 - for again capital F a and there it is to
03:52 - find my name in this file I can use
03:55 - forward slash the girl and there's a few
04:02 - results that are found so to move
04:05 - through each of them in the right words
04:07 - direction I can use lowercase n if I
04:13 - want to move left words I can use
04:15 - capital n so you can make the forward
04:20 - slash much more efficient if your cursor
04:23 - is
04:23 - on a word like so that you want to look
04:28 - for throughout the file you can use
04:29 - pound then thumb them clicking the pound
04:34 - again will allow you to navigate left
04:37 - words through each matched word like so
04:41 - the Asterix sign does the exact same
04:44 - thing except this time clicking it again
04:47 - will allow you to navigate right words
04:49 - so let's press extract and it's
04:52 - navigating right words okay now let's
04:55 - start editing lowercase D deletes
04:58 - something that something can be one of
05:00 - our navigation or search commands for
05:03 - example D and closing curly bracket will
05:07 - delete the entire paragraph over here D
05:11 - wasn't awesome
05:13 - and it's gone if you mess up on writing
05:17 - a function and want to delete everything
05:19 - up until and including this ending
05:22 - parenthesis you can use D F and closing
05:27 - parenthesis and it's gone if you wanted
05:30 - to keep that last parenthesis then you
05:33 - can use D T closing parenthesis like so
05:38 - and that closing parenthesis is still
05:42 - there all right
05:44 - so DW lets you delete one word if you
05:51 - want to delete five words or let's do
05:54 - two for now we can do two DW and you get
06:00 - the point to delete this entire line I
06:02 - can use D D to paste that line that I
06:07 - just deleted after my cursor I'll use
06:10 - lowercase P and there it is if I wanted
06:14 - to taste it before my cursor I can use
06:17 - capital P and there it is I can also
06:22 - delete within specific characters using
06:26 - di if I wanted to delete whatever is in
06:30 - it
06:30 - I can use di t so let's try the leading
06:35 - what's in this table using deit and it's
06:41 - gone okay similarly D I opening
06:48 - parenthesis will delete everything that
06:50 - is in a parenthesis so let's move on
06:52 - over took this parenthesis di and there
06:59 - it is say I don't want the tag that's
07:04 - over here what I can do is delete the
07:08 - entire tag by using da2 and T and it's
07:13 - all gone
07:14 - alright so if you want just to type
07:18 - after deleting a seat I is like di on
07:24 - steroids it deletes and puts you
07:26 - straight into insert mode for example
07:29 - I'm going to delete whatever is inside
07:31 - this single quote so I'm gonna use CI
07:35 - single quote and now I deleted it and I
07:39 - can I'm automatically on enter mode okay
07:45 - similarly C I T will do the same that
07:49 - the closest tag to I T I've not only
07:54 - deleted what is inside I can also type
07:57 - because I'm automatically and insert
08:00 - okay I am done with this file to save
08:03 - and exit you can use lower case X you're
08:07 - gonna have to do Co semicolon and then
08:10 - lower case X and enter but I actually
08:13 - need the original code for this I'm
08:16 - going to exit without saving using
08:18 - semicolon lowercase U and
08:22 - explanation mark that ends my intro to
08:26 - them now you know how to insert navigate
08:29 - search and edit in vim I encourage you
08:32 - to get rid of your sublime or atom and
08:35 - force yourself to use only them if
08:37 - you're really serious about switching to
08:39 - this awesome text editor until next time
