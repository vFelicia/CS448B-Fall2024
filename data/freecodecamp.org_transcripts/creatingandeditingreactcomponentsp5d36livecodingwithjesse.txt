00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with Jessie sorry I was a few minutes
00:08 - late I went to hit the button to start
00:12 - the stream and I realized that the
00:14 - camera wasn't on so I I don't know if it
00:19 - just wasn't working all day and I didn't
00:20 - notice I didn't really have OBS up until
00:23 - a few minutes before the stream so I
00:25 - wouldn't known but anyway everything
00:30 - should be working now and let me move
00:35 - this over let's let's uh make that
00:41 - bigger and now move this over here and
00:56 - this should work now there we are and
01:00 - I'm gonna paste the end rock link for
01:01 - you all there we go okay
01:05 - so first thing I'm gonna do is go over
01:08 - some changes that I've made so I've been
01:13 - doing I don't like a decent amount of
01:15 - work on this myself over the last like
01:19 - day or two so when I want to make sure
01:23 - we're on the same page with where we're
01:25 - at and what I need to do I'm gonna fill
01:27 - you in on how my presentation went
01:29 - yesterday so for those of you who are
01:33 - first-time viewers or just you know
01:35 - maybe haven't seen that much in this
01:38 - show I my day-to-day work as a front-end
01:41 - developer for a small University so
01:44 - there's gonna be mistakes
01:46 - we're there's gonna be interruptions so
01:51 - it's not exactly tutorial it's just it's
01:54 - just my everyday work this is what I do
01:56 - and I don't prepare anything and I don't
01:59 - try to make it look any better or worse
02:01 - than it really is so having said that
02:06 - we're working on a site and this is
02:09 - going to be the main website for the
02:11 - university it was supposed to launch
02:13 - by the end of this month we were on
02:15 - pretty good track I think it was gonna
02:17 - be I was gonna have to work late you
02:19 - know probably for a week or so but I
02:22 - think we were gonna be able to launch
02:23 - with the minimum you know that we needed
02:26 - but some people higher up have decided
02:32 - that we're not gonna launch them that I
02:38 - basically I need to meet with a bunch of
02:40 - different people all over the university
02:42 - present the site to them
02:44 - and get some feedback and then launch at
02:49 - some later date to be determined so I
02:52 - don't even have another date yet I did
02:55 - the first of those meetings yesterday it
02:59 - was okay I think you know I I didn't get
03:03 - a standing round of applause which I
03:05 - didn't really expect to get anyway but I
03:08 - didn't really get negative feedback from
03:12 - anyone so there are some features that
03:14 - they seem to to like the speed they like
03:18 - the speed I had n rock up and I let
03:22 - everybody load it on their phones so
03:24 - they could check out how it looks on a
03:25 - mobile and what else it they like the
03:31 - ability to go in and edit so I actually
03:33 - went into WordPress and showed at that
03:37 - particular department we're in our
03:39 - WordPress installation they would go to
03:41 - edit their own content and then I I
03:44 - showed them how easy it would be and so
03:48 - I think they liked those features so not
03:51 - bad wasn't a really big presentation it
03:53 - was just one small department and there
03:57 - are actually some people missing from
03:58 - the presentation so it was even smaller
04:00 - than I thought it was going to be some
04:02 - work we're talking like I don't know
04:04 - maybe like seven people if that so some
04:08 - of my other presentations would probably
04:10 - be bigger next then my next presentation
04:12 - is gonna be a big one I I meet with all
04:14 - the all the bosses all the vice
04:16 - presidents and and stuff and I'm gonna
04:19 - present it to them so having said all
04:23 - that it's kind of a big intro this is
04:26 - where we're at right now
04:27 - the project we've kind of put everything
04:29 - else on hold and we're trying to make
04:32 - this site look as nice as we can for
04:38 - some certain like key pages so that when
04:42 - I present it it looks as finished as
04:44 - possible even though we know you know in
04:47 - the background it's not finished we
04:48 - don't have all the data migrated so if
04:50 - before each presentation I'm gonna
04:52 - handpick certain pages and certain
04:55 - pieces of data even if we have to hard
04:57 - code them in it doesn't really matter we
05:00 - just need to make sure those pages are
05:02 - ready so for yesterday's presentation I
05:04 - made sure it was the student life
05:06 - department so I made sure that the
05:08 - student life page had all the data on it
05:11 - right otherwise he probably wouldn't
05:14 - worried about that page till later on
05:15 - down the road but that's how it's gonna
05:19 - go so I'm gonna have to determine what
05:22 - content would be best to have on the
05:25 - site for this next presentation for all
05:28 - the you know the VIPs of the vice
05:33 - president's and and so on of this
05:36 - University so I'm not really that
05:39 - worried about it surprisingly but I know
05:43 - you know other people were kind of
05:46 - nervous that are gonna be in the
05:47 - presentation with me so I do want to do
05:48 - a good job so here's what we're going to
05:52 - do today we're gonna make some
05:56 - components to try to clean up this
06:00 - homepage because I was looking it was
06:02 - huge
06:02 - right so I've already begun to do some
06:04 - of that and as we go through the code
06:05 - I'll show you what I pulled out and what
06:07 - components I created and we wanna we're
06:13 - gonna add a section here so we're gonna
06:15 - add a little section that's going to be
06:17 - full width and pretty much just text but
06:20 - it's going to be a little bit of
06:21 - explanation about what this university
06:23 - is about what the what the mission is
06:25 - for the university and that's going to
06:27 - kind of introduce students prospective
06:30 - students for the main audience so they
06:32 - come here they're going to see maybe not
06:34 - this picture I just put this picture in
06:36 - to try it out let me know what you all
06:38 - think the last picture I had
06:40 - there was a landscape shot and the head
06:45 - of my department didn't really like that
06:47 - picture so now I've decided to go with a
06:49 - shot of actual students see if I kind of
06:53 - prefer that I think there's kind of a
06:55 - connection when you see a person's face
06:57 - and this is kind of kind of nice right
07:00 - everyone's smiling it seems like I don't
07:05 - know like hey people are happy here
07:08 - I don't know let me know what you all
07:11 - think I really want your input on this
07:12 - I've been going through pictures in fact
07:14 - like the first half-hour I was here this
07:16 - morning I just spent the whole time
07:17 - going through images trying to figure
07:20 - out what to put in here so we're gonna
07:22 - try this and as the student Scrolls down
07:26 - then they're going to get a little bit
07:28 - about the mission of the University and
07:30 - they're gonna have the we're gonna put a
07:31 - button in there that's going to let them
07:33 - go on to read more more about that the
07:36 - university actually has this gigantic
07:38 - like mission and vision statement is
07:40 - huge but anyway then they're gonna come
07:44 - down and they're gonna see more of this
07:45 - and my boss wants me to have more like
07:48 - this where we actually say what the
07:50 - content is so instead of just having a
07:52 - card that's just an image or just a
07:54 - video we're gonna have you know two
07:57 - titles there so it's going to say on
08:00 - basically what this video is about or
08:02 - what this is an image of and we're gonna
08:05 - add some more profiles in there so we'll
08:08 - get as much done as we can in about an
08:09 - hour I do have to go and pick my kids up
08:13 - in about an hour and 15 minutes I have
08:16 - to leave for that so I'm just gonna keep
08:19 - that in mind and I just realized that I
08:22 - don't have any music going it's because
08:24 - I restarted my computer all right
08:29 - I can't possibly code without my music
08:32 - right
08:40 - all right cool so I am getting some
08:45 - feedback on the images and on the the
08:47 - new thing so let's start with that
08:50 - because that's the first thing we could
08:52 - probably work on here
08:55 - hey everybody that's saying I know I
08:58 - appreciate it thanks for watching Chris
09:02 - says love your videos thank you for the
09:04 - hard work and the time you put into them
09:05 - oh no problem thanks for saying that I'm
09:09 - happy that lets you enjoy the videos so
09:13 - Saad says white text on white background
09:16 - is hard to read yeah I think so too I
09:20 - did darken it so I put let me show you
09:24 - how I did this where's my and I can
09:30 - introduce you to a component that I've
09:33 - made as well while we're doing this so I
09:37 - took that ol hero section and I made
09:39 - this component called hero so now on
09:43 - interior pages we could pop in this hero
09:45 - component if we want to and other pages
09:47 - can have hero sections so I am here's
09:53 - here's how I did this I actually put in
09:57 - in line was
10:06 - okay I split all this stuff out there is
10:12 - our actual return there's our actual
10:14 - return okay so because I wanted to be
10:18 - able to pass a prop that's an image URL
10:19 - that's why I'm doing the style here in
10:21 - line but I've added a linear gradient
10:24 - first so the background image can take
10:27 - multiple things as what the background
10:30 - will be and it just stacks them on top
10:32 - so the first thing you put in will be on
10:35 - the top right and then after that or
10:39 - just layer so you can put in multiple
10:41 - images whatever you want so in this case
10:43 - we started out with a linear gradient
10:45 - and I just put the same two values for
10:50 - the linear gradient so normally it'll go
10:52 - like it'll go from one value to the
10:54 - other like gradually well if you put the
10:57 - same value it's just an overlay
10:59 - basically of all the same color
11:01 - so in this case we just did black but we
11:06 - made it transparent so it's only about
11:07 - 20% right now so that's how what I tried
11:12 - to do to make it a bit more readable I'm
11:17 - open to other options but this is
11:21 - something that standard that can
11:23 - increase readability no matter what
11:25 - image we put in there so I like it as
11:31 - kind of a standard thing for this
11:32 - component to be reusable but I'm
11:34 - definitely open to doing something
11:35 - different especially for the homepage so
11:41 - and this component has a lot of props to
11:45 - it so it's not it's not ideal right now
11:50 - let me get rid of some stuff I was
11:52 - working on them finished with so I can
11:54 - show you let me know if the the font
11:57 - needs to be larger for this so here's
12:02 - that euro component and there's a lot in
12:04 - here but this this is using every single
12:07 - option that the component has so if you
12:10 - leave out some of these the component
12:12 - will just render differently so probably
12:16 - most of the time when we use this we're
12:17 - not going to use all the options in
12:19 - there
12:19 - so it won't be so huge but for right now
12:22 - it's it's just a lot of stuff for one
12:26 - component but still takes a lot less
12:31 - space than the actual code for all that
12:34 - so anyway yeah I agree that this is hard
12:36 - to read one thing I am going to do is I
12:39 - would like to increase the font size for
12:43 - this line and for these buttons
12:46 - hopefully that'll make things a little
12:49 - bit easier to read so we can mess around
12:54 - with that here to make these inverted
12:56 - buttons I also had to make another
12:58 - component so I guess I should just show
13:02 - that component now since we're at that
13:03 - part
13:04 - I made this inverted button component
13:07 - because what I found was that you
13:10 - couldn't change the hover color there
13:13 - wasn't an easy way to change the hover
13:15 - color using the the material UI button
13:19 - component so I wanted to keep using that
13:21 - but I also wanted to be able to change
13:24 - the color so here's what I did I went
13:27 - into the repo for material UI I
13:30 - completely copied everything in there
13:32 - for their button component
13:34 - I changed the paths so if they would
13:38 - work because these paths were relative
13:40 - paths before assuming that this was
13:42 - located in the node modules folder so I
13:46 - changed those out and it's really simple
13:48 - anywhere that add a dot dot slash I just
13:51 - replaced the dot dot with material you I
13:54 - so down here where we have our flat
13:59 - secondary button because this happened
14:03 - to be the buttons that I was using on
14:05 - the hero section there I change the
14:08 - hover background to white and then I
14:12 - added in a color to this this green
14:16 - color to the official green color for
14:19 - the University and that allowed me to
14:23 - have this this effect while still using
14:29 - the button component so
14:32 - it's actually kind of cool the only
14:34 - problem with this is that as material UI
14:38 - updates it could potentially break
14:41 - what's going on in here so I'm gonna
14:44 - have to keep an eye on that it may not
14:46 - be the final solution but as I said you
14:49 - know earlier we need solutions that are
14:51 - going to work fast
14:53 - for the presentations and we can always
14:55 - come back later and and fix them but for
15:00 - now this is kind of cool it works and it
15:02 - gives us complete control over these
15:04 - buttons to do whatever we want so you
15:06 - see there's a ton of options here so I'm
15:08 - a little bit excited as we go on to kind
15:11 - of go in here and just figure out more
15:14 - about how material works like the
15:16 - internal stuff that's hidden away in the
15:18 - node modules and and try to change it a
15:21 - little bit don't think it'll be fun but
15:26 - anyway it did solve our problem as you
15:29 - can see we're gonna have to use it for
15:31 - this as well because we we don't have
15:33 - the right color here so we have to
15:36 - change this I don't know if we'll do
15:39 - that today or not we'll see I added in a
15:41 - new logo so my department head wanted to
15:47 - have this logo especially on the desktop
15:49 - but as I was looking this works as long
15:54 - as we don't add anything here which we
15:56 - don't plan to this does work you know I
16:01 - think I'm worried about it's on a really
16:02 - small screen but if it if it checks out
16:07 - it works even on a really small screen
16:09 - you might keep it that's too big let's
16:12 - go on this iPhone 4 is tiny yeah see it
16:16 - doesn't work on the small screen so
16:17 - we're gonna have to do something to
16:19 - switch out for the other logo to like
16:22 - let's go big again so I can show you
16:25 - it's like this version of a logo so
16:28 - we'll switch that out but otherwise this
16:33 - logo is okay I probably need to make it
16:34 - a bit bigger but those are pretty much
16:39 - the the biggest things that I've changed
16:42 - lately I've done some work with interior
16:44 - pages
16:47 - let me check out some of the other
16:50 - suggestions that we got right off the
16:51 - bat
16:55 - someone says Steubenville with an
16:57 - exclamation point so g jr j r y a n so J
17:06 - ryan rocks is that how you say it anyway
17:10 - do you know Steve oh are you from
17:12 - Stephenville let me know let's see John
17:22 - said nice tip for that linear gradient
17:23 - cool yeah I can't remember where I
17:25 - learned that if I did remember I
17:28 - definitely give credit to where I
17:30 - learned that from I think it was a blog
17:32 - somewhere maybe it was CSS tricks I
17:36 - can't remember for sure yeah but it's
17:38 - like such an easy way to put a gradient
17:41 - on I remember trying to put like divs
17:43 - inside of divs to do gradients and it's
17:45 - like no this is this is so simple all
17:50 - right well okay Jeff says you can make
17:56 - the gradient variable variable as well
17:58 - yeah you could we could make a prop for
18:01 - a gradient so I did have to stop myself
18:03 - I was going crazy with all the props to
18:05 - customize it and I just had to stop and
18:07 - say like honestly we're using this
18:10 - component once as of right now do I
18:12 - really need to make all these props so
18:14 - we you know I'll probably need that
18:16 - props as we go on but no sense in trying
18:19 - to like think of everything we possibly
18:20 - could need right off the bat Jeff says I
18:26 - think there needs to be more space
18:27 - between faith and life in the search
18:28 - icon yeah definitely yeah this got
18:32 - messed up somewhere along the line and
18:34 - I'm not sure what I did but I don't
18:36 - think it was always like this but it's
18:39 - definite need changed
18:52 - J Brian Rock says when you get that
18:55 - color straightened out you can sell it
18:56 - to slack and make a zillion bucks they
18:58 - need to fix the color of the highlights
19:00 - so that the dark background themes work
19:12 - okay all right so let's let's get into
19:17 - some code can we do you know what let me
19:21 - let's put in this section here we're
19:23 - gonna make a component called tech
19:26 - section and so primarily it's going to
19:30 - take as props a link in case there needs
19:33 - to be a button and then a block of text
19:37 - that right off the bat we need those two
19:42 - props we might be able to think of some
19:44 - other props that we'll need but this
19:46 - will be a section that I'm sure will be
19:47 - repeated in various places so let's make
19:51 - that component and then we'll put that
19:52 - component in there and have that that
19:54 - kind of intermediate section you know
19:58 - what let's take four props right off the
20:00 - bat let's do the the - I just said text
20:06 - and then a link the link will be
20:07 - optional if we don't have a link we
20:11 - won't render a button and actually if
20:13 - we're gonna have a link then we need to
20:15 - add a link text so will be of three and
20:19 - then we're gonna add a background color
20:23 - and a font color so we're gonna have
20:27 - five props and that should be enough to
20:32 - have some nice customization the only
20:35 - other thing I could think of right now
20:36 - is a title maybe we should just add a
20:40 - title drop in yeah so we're gonna end up
20:45 - with six props so we're gonna make
20:49 - component we're gonna have those six
20:50 - props and then we're going to have the
20:52 - section in and then it'll be really easy
20:55 - for us to just add in sections wherever
20:57 - any pages we want so we're kind of
21:00 - making some building blocks to build out
21:02 - some really good-looking pages quickly
21:03 - we can
21:04 - make hero sections quickly and we're
21:06 - about to be able to make tech sections
21:07 - quickly and then we can we can move
21:12 - pretty fast and build out some pages for
21:14 - these presentations there was another
21:17 - question and I can answer this why I'm
21:19 - doing that so someone asked what kind of
21:23 - music others do Peter asked what kind of
21:25 - music I listen to right now I'm
21:27 - listening to my top songs of 2016
21:29 - playlist on Spotify which is a mix of a
21:34 - lot of dubstep and the Creed soundtrack
21:40 - so from you know the the Rocky movie
21:42 - right Creed creed soundtrack and then
21:45 - acoustic covers of songs so yeah that's
21:51 - that's a lot of what it is and then yeah
21:56 - I'd say that covers probably like 90% of
21:59 - what's in on this playlist right now I
22:04 - really listen to pretty much anything
22:06 - the only thing that I consistently don't
22:09 - like is country music everything else I
22:13 - will listen to depends on the mood I'm
22:15 - on or mood I'm in alright so we need a
22:19 - new component so let's start out with a
22:22 - blank file new file we're gonna call
22:25 - this text section and let's grab let's
22:34 - grab this hero component just to give us
22:37 - the base now I'm starting out all my
22:41 - components as class components we can go
22:45 - back later and refactor into stateless
22:48 - functional components if that's what we
22:50 - want but I find it easier to go from a
22:52 - class to stateless than to go from state
22:54 - leads to a class so that's why I'm
22:56 - starting out with the classes even
22:58 - though it might be overkill for a lot of
23:01 - the components that we're making all
23:06 - right so what are we gonna need we're
23:08 - definitely you need typography we're
23:10 - gonna keep this inverted button and the
23:14 - grid alright cool so we have a lot of
23:16 - what we need already we can get rid of
23:22 - see here a button an inverted button
23:26 - let's keep these styles for now because
23:28 - I think we can reuse some of them with
23:30 - just a little bit of editing so that'll
23:32 - save us some time
23:33 - let's get rid of a lot of this and then
23:36 - let's let's type out all the props that
23:38 - we know we're going to need here so
23:40 - we're doing some D structuring here so
23:42 - that we don't have to keep typing this
23:43 - props but this will be a nice list so
23:45 - that we don't forget what props we want
23:47 - so as I said we're gonna have title sex
23:53 - actually let's make this section title
24:02 - text I wanted to make it section Saito
24:05 - because title is actually an attribute
24:07 - that you can put on some elements so I
24:09 - don't like to have the same names so
24:12 - that no one gets confused when they're
24:13 - looking at things so we have the text we
24:18 - will have a button link button text and
24:29 - color let's go to say text color and
24:36 - background background color I said oh
24:44 - yeah I think that's it all right cool so
24:50 - we have these not let's go in here and
24:53 - we can get rid of pretty much all these
24:56 - constants you can see in this component
24:59 - I made all these constants because a lot
25:01 - of these are they're contingent upon
25:05 - whether or not a prop is there so it's
25:08 - just a lot cleaner when we pull these
25:11 - out into their own constants so that we
25:14 - can say you can easily see like if title
25:17 - text is there make a title if the
25:19 - subtitles there make a subtitle right if
25:21 - the primary button text secondary button
25:23 - text or tertiary button text is present
25:25 - then let's let's start rendering this
25:28 - grid that contains buttons right for the
25:30 - buttons I like to do both what
25:32 - and link so if there's not text and the
25:35 - link we you know we don't render it has
25:38 - to have both right no sense having a
25:41 - button that links somewhere but no text
25:42 - or the other way around so anyway that's
25:47 - kind of a nice like an easy way to clean
25:49 - up your components without actually
25:50 - having to make a lot of other components
25:52 - and link them up alright so anyway let
26:01 - me get rid of these and I did I use the
26:09 - word tertiary for the third button is
26:12 - that word well-known enough that it's
26:14 - okay like is everybody know what
26:17 - tertiary is I know you'll use that word
26:21 - often but I mean it was the correct word
26:23 - like if we were using like primary
26:25 - secondary it's it's definitely the
26:27 - correct one but I'm a little I was a
26:30 - little bit nervous that people wouldn't
26:32 - necessarily know especially like maybe I
26:34 - think this is not the first your first
26:36 - language maybe even if English is your
26:40 - first language nobody uses that word
26:42 - anymore anyway let me know if you think
26:45 - that would be an issue because I do want
26:46 - this code to be like readable okay now
26:52 - we can take pretty much all of this
26:58 - let's go yeah let's take out this first
27:03 - and yeah we definitely want this out of
27:08 - here we can leave the div so we're gonna
27:11 - need a div and the class name parallax
27:19 - weird if we can just make this a grid so
27:22 - we need that grid container right grid
27:26 - and then at the top grid we make a
27:29 - container don't we and you're there
27:38 - a great container and then we're gonna
27:44 - have a grid
27:56 - and I think I wish you'd do this
28:03 - I don't like to Center things but I'm
28:06 - almost positive I'm gonna get asked to
28:08 - Center it
28:09 - let's just not Center this and then see
28:14 - if I can get by without without
28:16 - centering this so I think I do want to
28:20 - make this first section just a div and
28:24 - then the tip is going to be full width
28:27 - so hopefully all right senator senator
28:31 - just actually I really I like these I
28:35 - want I don't want a min how you right
28:41 - now we don't need anything with this
28:45 - background stuff we won't need that I'm
28:56 - not gonna Center this least not yet and
29:03 - I leave these buttons for now
29:14 - so I'm not gonna worry about the the
29:16 - grid component yet I'm just gonna throw
29:18 - in some normal components typography go
29:29 - to use here I need to go back to the
29:32 - here let's move our hero section over
29:34 - here so I can see what typography I used
29:37 - here
29:46 - all right we use the display to up there
29:49 - we try that typography type display too
29:59 - and yeah it was good
30:04 - go to our bottom just go with that and
30:11 - then we're gonna put in here I'm gonna
30:20 - say it was section title section title
30:26 - goes in there and then we can close out
30:30 - our typography tag all right and then
30:38 - let's to grab this as well and let's put
30:46 - text here and we're gonna display that
30:51 - as it's a normal setting for text
31:05 - [Music]
31:12 - I should just look up so like I don't
31:15 - have these stocks open typography area
31:26 - where's the type shows in classes color
31:32 - variants okay now its variant we didn't
31:37 - update to this this one yet so where it
31:39 - says variant we're gonna use tight but
31:41 - just so you know if you get the latest
31:42 - version use variant instead we're gonna
31:46 - have to update everything at some point
31:49 - but I don't want to do it right now
31:51 - because I got to focus on getting things
31:53 - ready for this presentation body okay
31:58 - that's what we need let's just use body
32:01 - one then see how it goes
32:06 - body one cool alright so yes there's fog
32:12 - rafi let's add in buttons what do you
32:18 - have buttons yeah let's just add in
32:22 - let's grab this put it in here and we'll
32:29 - change it
32:34 - we'll just call it button and we're
32:42 - gonna change this to button link and
32:47 - we're going to change this to button
32:57 - text okay we're gonna have to pull in
33:02 - inverted button oh we already have it
33:04 - cool all right
33:05 - so we have that now down here we can
33:09 - just render button and we're going to
33:15 - conditionally render these but right now
33:17 - I'm I'm not worried about that I just
33:18 - want to make sure it works first before
33:19 - we do all the conditional stuff that way
33:21 - if something doesn't work it's going to
33:23 - be a lot easier to figure out why it's
33:24 - not working okay one more no that's it
33:30 - right it's only need for now we can put
33:34 - in the text color and background color
33:36 - so let's do that color
33:49 - yes
33:58 - yes I don't really yeah I don't need
34:06 - that right now but I don't want to get
34:08 - an error because I haven't used those so
34:13 - let's just go and say for now text color
34:32 - background-color now it's just not gonna
34:38 - give me an error when I try to do this
34:41 - and why is I make I'm getting an error
34:46 - here up I have him outside the div there
34:55 - we go we never changed the name of this
34:58 - component so it's not here oh it is text
35:02 - section and I forgot to set my timer
35:08 - sorry about that so it's definitely time
35:10 - for me to take a break so let's do that
35:18 - where's my index that's it
35:24 - yeah I'm just gonna bring this up so I
35:27 - don't forget where we are but when we
35:29 - I'm gonna take a five-minute break I'm
35:30 - gonna answer some questions when we come
35:32 - back to the code I'm going to import
35:35 - this component that we just made put
35:37 - some props in see how how it looks then
35:41 - we can adjust styles and everything like
35:43 - that for now I am going to remember my
35:49 - timer this time would you do a short
35:51 - break and I'm going to start at the top
35:55 - of the chat and just scroll down and try
35:58 - to get to all the comments and questions
36:23 - i Grimm asked about the media query for
36:27 - the small screen size I yes so we for
36:32 - media queries we are using where is it
36:36 - at
36:36 - I just deleted a media query from
36:40 - something so I don't know if we're using
36:43 - it anymore there's a way to do media
36:45 - queries within material UI so is so we
36:55 - have these breakpoints so you can go and
36:58 - put theme breakpoint and this is up so
37:02 - on any screens medium and up the
37:03 - background color changes to red in this
37:06 - case so for the route component it's
37:08 - blue normally on medium and up it's red
37:12 - so that's how we're gonna do it so we're
37:15 - just do thin breakpoints down and then
37:18 - we'll put small in here and then we'll
37:22 - be able to change for small screens so
37:25 - what we'll probably end up doing for the
37:28 - app bar is I think right now I'm
37:32 - directly putting the image in what may
37:34 - end up doing is making the image a
37:36 - background image so that we can control
37:38 - it right from from these styles and use
37:45 - breakpoints and I think that's going to
37:46 - end up being the easiest way to do it
37:49 - and for a bi image I mean I'm talking
37:52 - about switching out this image for small
37:56 - screens
38:10 - Sud says for design and layout ideas you
38:13 - should check universities websites these
38:15 - will give you some good ideas about your
38:17 - website
38:18 - yeah I've I do check out university
38:21 - sites from time to time I'm I'm a little
38:28 - bit torn so I want there to be some
38:32 - familiarity so that we users come to the
38:34 - site they understand what's going on but
38:36 - I also want to make this unique you know
38:40 - I mean some it's my design and
38:42 - development not just me you'll help a
38:45 - lot but like we're working on this and I
38:48 - kind of I want it to be unique I wanted
38:52 - to break the mold a little about what
38:54 - university sites you know are doing so
38:58 - I'm trying to balance that so I've
39:02 - actually what I do get inspiration for
39:06 - is for small details from the way other
39:09 - sites do things so like we looked at for
39:13 - our list component we looked at the
39:17 - newsstand app that's made by Google and
39:21 - we look at one piece of that newsstand
39:23 - app and got some ideas for how to
39:26 - display our content so I like doing that
39:30 - more than like in terms of like a whole
39:34 - layout I don't know I find like your
39:39 - site looks more unique in that way I
39:43 - don't know but if anybody seems a really
39:46 - cool University site or other site that
39:48 - you think would be good inspiration for
39:50 - something we're doing here let me know
39:51 - because I definitely check it out and
39:54 - see if it's you know something we could
39:57 - use for this project or even a different
39:59 - one
40:05 - um MRA AMR is the name so I'm not sure I
40:10 - pronounced have a last name is awesome
40:12 - so says hey wish me luck in my quiz
40:16 - tomorrow good luck I hope you do well in
40:20 - your quiz let let us know next week how
40:23 - you do on your quiz let's see Jay Ryan
40:31 - Rock says tertiary means mix from two
40:33 - other things right in color so I assume
40:36 - it's like one generation removed
40:37 - otherwise yet right I wasn't even
40:40 - thinking about colors for tertiary but I
40:42 - was thinking more of like primary being
40:47 - like well first secondary second
40:49 - tertiary third so I guess I could have
40:56 - gone like first button second button
40:57 - third button that would have been maybe
41:00 - that would have been a easier I guess I
41:04 - kind of wanted like primary button and
41:07 - then there's going to be two secondary
41:08 - button so I thought about doing
41:09 - secondary one in secondary to that might
41:13 - actually make more sense than tertiary
41:16 - maybe I'm just making a big deal about
41:18 - nothing
41:24 - yeah maybe maybe I'll change it let's
41:32 - see
41:35 - I think I got everything all the
41:38 - questions almost all of them Oh Nicky
41:48 - says for stateless to class select the
41:51 - function and ctrl shift P to select
41:59 - react pure to state it's a plugin oh
42:03 - cool you know what I totally forgot
42:06 - about that so in the reactor food-truck
42:08 - plugin which i do have for visual studio
42:12 - code they do have a plugin for switching
42:17 - from functional stateless functional
42:21 - components to stateful component the
42:24 - class based and it just automatically
42:27 - does it for you
42:28 - I forgot about that now that I you say
42:32 - it like that was one of the coolest
42:33 - features of the react foot truck when I
42:37 - decided to download it and I haven't
42:39 - even used it alright
42:47 - Anna Anna has a question about where to
42:50 - where do you see yourself in five years
42:52 - I'm gonna think about that while we do
42:54 - this code and then Anna when we come
42:56 - back after this next coding session
42:59 - that'll be the first question that I
43:00 - answer alright
43:11 - so I would do 25 minutes may not take
43:14 - the whole 25 minutes we'll see how long
43:16 - this takes to do what we're doing I do
43:19 - want to make sure I have time at the end
43:20 - for questions and that I do have time to
43:27 - pick up my kids don't want to leave them
43:31 - at school right okay all right yeah
43:36 - here's what we're doing so let's go here
43:39 - oops that's not a component let me copy
43:42 - this paste and we're gonna go what do we
43:51 - call that text section check section and
43:56 - then down here right after our hero
44:00 - section we're going to put our text
44:02 - section here text section and we need
44:09 - our props so scroll down make sure we
44:13 - get all the props so let's try section
44:20 - title and the section title is going to
44:26 - be let's just let's go mission and text
44:40 - for now be or remove some I need more
44:48 - than that why isn't it an atom I had an
44:52 - automatic like lorem ipsum generator
44:54 - that's right I'm not worried about it
44:56 - now I just want to make sure it all
44:57 - renders text for the button link oops
45:07 - button link we're just gonna make it
45:12 - here so at least we'll have something it
45:14 - will render button text and more it's
45:25 - pretty standard and that's all we
45:31 - shouldn't need let's see hopefully we
45:36 - don't get some sort of error when they
45:38 - try to render this stuff we'll see how
45:40 - it goes
45:44 - hmm it rose not to find where am i using
45:50 - hero at 72 oh I forgot here text section
46:05 - now that's where it went so I tried to
46:14 - use multiple cursors to change this not
46:16 - realizing that I had that text in here
46:18 - as well so I thought I selected this
46:20 - text but it didn't yeah it worked okay
46:27 - cool so we have a section it says
46:30 - mission we got our lorem ipsum text and
46:32 - then we have our learn more button which
46:34 - you can't really see because the colors
46:37 - are off but not bad cool definitely need
46:49 - some styling now let's see
46:54 - so let's get to styling let's change
46:57 - this class from parallax to section
47:14 - and we're gonna add to this so let's do
47:22 - some padding yeah we knew padding and I
47:30 - want let's say let's try 32 pixels of
47:46 - padding and zero on the sides let's just
47:51 - try it out and for our button colors
48:01 - let's give it
48:05 - yeah let's switch it up and let's do two
48:12 - one four one two a
48:20 - cool all right let's see how this looks
48:23 - all right nice yeah nice that's it
48:27 - that's a nice amount of padding maybe
48:30 - might one more but for right now I like
48:33 - that let's let's put on this section we
48:42 - do ever get her bottom on here - why
48:44 - isn't it showing it let's see so we have
48:53 - a margin bottom we should have
48:59 - interesting
49:07 - I'm not gonna adjust this until we get
49:09 - more text in there because I need to see
49:12 - it in the context like of what it will
49:17 - likely be in and I we do have everything
49:21 - centered right now which I didn't want
49:23 - to Center but I guess I've I miss some
49:26 - class on her I did a line item center
49:30 - justify content starts let's fresh start
49:40 - and I'm gonna flip it around is it this
49:47 - one there we are
49:50 - okay so depending on like where your
49:55 - axis is reflects these could be flipped
49:59 - around okay probably don't need to
50:09 - justify content centers since we have
50:11 - the padding at the top and bottom it but
50:14 - I'm gonna leave it in there instead in
50:16 - case we change it at this point we want
50:19 - to set a probably a max
50:34 - so we have this container whoops
50:39 - we don't need container in there so we
50:42 - need this container to be a hundred
50:44 - percent with because if we put in a
50:45 - background color we need that actually
50:50 - let's put in a background color just so
50:52 - that we can see exactly where everything
50:54 - is background color mm say purple yay
51:14 - how beautiful all right
51:29 - so if I don't want it to be centered
51:34 - then I need a container component so
51:48 - let's put this in here I guess I could
51:53 - use the grid container here and see what
51:55 - it does let's try it out maybe the grid
52:01 - container already has some built-in
52:04 - stuff if it doesn't we'll just throw in
52:10 - our own and then set it to like a
52:13 - percentage with what's aesthetic
52:27 - that's okay so I guess since I didn't
52:31 - have this in the grid I'm not about
52:40 - getting anything happening good item
52:46 - okay so the hero button stuff is is
52:49 - centering all right let's see what
52:56 - happens now
52:57 - all right now it goes over so weird all
53:06 - right let's just switch this up instead
53:09 - of a grid I'm just gonna make a div for
53:14 - now and instead of container
53:33 - this is close and ER container
53:47 - and let's say with
54:01 - max width is going to be 70 oops
54:13 - 70%
54:49 - Oh
55:03 - should I use margin:0 auto or is there
55:06 - flex box thing that I should use we're
55:09 - gonna say justify content or what did we
55:14 - say it was
55:23 - now this will work let's just do that I
55:27 - see some activity there in the live chat
55:30 - so I will check that out in just a
55:32 - second container margin:0 auto and this
55:41 - is just to Center that container
55:49 - actually let's let's not do let's just
55:56 - just do with 70 okay so that's gonna
56:05 - give us our offset there
56:14 - okay
56:21 - all right now bad let me grab the
56:24 - correct text so we could see what that
56:27 - looks like when I say not bad I don't
56:32 - mean like it's perfect I just mean we're
56:35 - getting there
56:38 - all right I really hope that the mission
56:48 - is on the website like the short version
56:59 - that I want
57:21 - there we are
57:26 - great alright so I was just grabbing it
57:30 - on my other screen and let me put in
57:33 - whoops the text here let's change this I
57:51 - like to just use template literals
57:53 - sometimes that way no matter what as
58:01 - long as it's gonna let me do that no
58:03 - matter what is in the text that we would
58:08 - put in here whether it's single or
58:09 - double quotes it doesn't matter it's not
58:11 - going to mess anything up so on the
58:15 - current website the title of this
58:17 - section is mission summary I don't know
58:19 - that I really want to keep that title
58:20 - but that's what we'll do for now
58:24 - usually questions about like content
58:27 - like that
58:27 - I just defer to my boss and lots so I'm
58:34 - not gonna let me do that no seriously
58:44 - not gonna let me use template littles
58:47 - alright fine I don't know what I'm doing
58:51 - wrong
58:51 - maybe I can't use them in there oh I
58:53 - can't use them because that's not jobs
58:56 - everyone
59:08 - all right so first thing that we notice
59:14 - that's off this text is way too small
59:17 - especially compared to this text even
59:21 - with more text this still needs to be
59:22 - have a bigger space so let's change this
59:30 - to let's try body 2 and see if it makes
59:34 - it bigger now it just makes it what is
59:42 - that
59:45 - alright let's stick with body 1 but then
59:48 - let's give this a class name
59:57 - oops classes
60:06 - section text
60:20 - and let's make the font size 16 pixels
60:30 - and font weights 400 and line height 1.5
60:54 - can I do that
60:56 - I think I can do that
61:02 - really today there's no way that's 16
61:11 - oops yeah where are we getting this
61:33 - oops haha I'm making lots of tiny
61:39 - mistakes here all right let's say I'm
61:49 - getting a call let me take this come up
61:55 - yes
62:06 - mm-hm
62:14 - oh okay yeah I'm sorry I didn't get your
62:16 - email so I don't know what happened with
62:18 - that but am i sorry about that otherwise
62:21 - we'll get back to you right away if yeah
62:28 - I I need to make sure I checked that
62:30 - folder more frequently so you can go you
62:37 - can either there's a forum on the
62:39 - bulletin on the actual website to submit
62:41 - a new bulletin announcement so you can
62:44 - send it through there if you want or you
62:46 - can just send an email to bulletin at
62:49 - Franciscan dot edu
63:01 - every Monday Monday morning yeah I think
63:08 - the cutoff is earlier today was the
63:10 - cutoff yeah you could still give it a
63:18 - shot and see occasionally some if
63:22 - someone's like an emergency it does get
63:23 - in but I can't guarantee anything oh
63:30 - yeah no problem
63:40 - all right sorry about that
63:44 - good thing I noticed earlier that there
63:46 - would probably be interruptions that was
63:54 - so in the interest of just sharing with
63:57 - you what my day is like it's a friend of
63:59 - developer I'm gonna summarize that Cole
64:01 - leaving out anyone's name a hug someone
64:06 - called and asked for information that is
64:10 - very much available on the bulletin
64:12 - website asked how to submit something to
64:17 - the bulletin well we have there in the
64:20 - bulletin several buttons to be able to
64:25 - submit and when you click it it has
64:26 - instructions for the deadlines of
64:28 - submitting so this person number one
64:32 - called and said I emailed you yesterday
64:34 - and you didn't get back to me so I'm
64:36 - going to call you I never received an
64:38 - email from that person so I let him know
64:40 - obviously as you heard they didn't
64:43 - receive the email right then they
64:48 - complained about the email system then I
64:52 - I let them know obviously how they can
64:55 - submit to the bulletin and then they
64:58 - said when there's bulletins come out
65:03 - Mondays say oh it's probably too late
65:06 - boy yeah it's too late
65:09 - said oh well that's no use to me and
65:11 - then you heard me say well it's worth a
65:13 - shot you can
65:14 - and they said I said oh well you know no
65:20 - problem
65:21 - and their response I think the last
65:24 - thing they said was well this turned out
65:27 - to be no use to me by that's I don't
65:36 - want to say that's a common response but
65:38 - it's definitely not the first time I've
65:40 - had a call or an email like that I don't
65:45 - know what's up here but I'm sure it's
65:47 - not only this organization that it
65:50 - happens in but there there are a group
65:52 - of people that have certain traits in
65:54 - common on campus that I don't understand
66:00 - if you talk to them face-to-face they're
66:02 - a lot nicer but via email or the phone
66:05 - they just treat you like you're not
66:08 - really a person I don't know anyway
66:14 - obviously I'm not upset by it but just
66:20 - wanted to share that with you that
66:21 - sometimes you have stuff like that so
66:23 - we're in the middle of developing a new
66:25 - site and I get a call just explaining
66:28 - information that we've already explained
66:30 - in emails and announcements and
66:33 - everything all right so here's what I
66:39 - want to happen I want the font size to
66:41 - be 16 wonderful and out 16 does that
66:46 - look like it's still too small should we
66:50 - make it 18 let me check the time - okay
66:57 - I definitely got a hurry up here so I
67:01 - can pick my kids up
67:02 - I like 18 better let me know what you
67:04 - think
67:10 - I think 18 works much much better and
67:14 - let's add in you know I'm not going to
67:19 - add any padding to the bottom of this
67:21 - because if we don't have stuff for the
67:23 - button it's not going to render and then
67:25 - I don't want to throw off the alignment
67:28 - the vertical alignment by adding padding
67:30 - so we're gonna add padding on the top of
67:32 - this button and we're gonna leave this
67:34 - alone but let's change this to 18 pixels
67:42 - and it's really odd but people have been
67:46 - freaking out way more than I thought
67:47 - they would
67:48 - about font sizes being larger I don't
67:53 - know why but larger fonts are a good
67:57 - thing it's easier to read you would
67:59 - think people would understand that but
68:02 - like within a certain age bracket of
68:05 - people they're always like why is the
68:07 - font so big so people can read it why
68:11 - why would we not want people to read it
68:15 - anyway let's do that last thing that we
68:19 - talked about with the inverted button at
68:24 - the grid all right so our hero button
68:28 - that's what we're gonna put so let's go
68:33 - with margin-top and we should give it
68:40 - let's try eight pixels might need to
68:44 - jump up a bit from there eight might be
68:46 - too small that yeah I can't even tell if
68:54 - anything happens so it's definitely too
68:55 - small let's jump to 16 there we go
69:01 - all right that's much more reasonable I
69:03 - like that nice
69:11 - okay unfortunately I'm not going to be
69:15 - able to finish this component but I'll
69:17 - tell you what I'm gonna do what I'm
69:20 - gonna do is just make these all
69:23 - conditional so I'll do one just to give
69:27 - you an example and then I'm just going
69:28 - to repeat that for for everything else
69:30 - so for the button I'm gonna say if we
69:35 - get button link so button link and
69:42 - button text then we will render button
69:47 - otherwise we're gonna render nothing
69:51 - we're gonna do null and why is my button
69:58 - oh I need a space there okay so that's
70:03 - what we're gonna do and then that way
70:04 - too you see we have a button now but if
70:07 - I remove even one of these so let's just
70:09 - take out the button link and say that
70:12 - see it doesn't render so we have to have
70:15 - both to get a button to render okay so I
70:23 - may I'm gonna commit this now so you all
70:29 - can see it in github and just in case I
70:31 - need to work on the weekend or something
70:33 - happens next week and I can't come in on
70:34 - Monday
70:35 - I have everything even though it's not
70:37 - quite finished let's let's do a git
70:41 - status and get ad and yarn cm and we had
70:52 - a new feature let's see create text
70:59 - section
71:07 - you ever look at a word and it looks
71:11 - like it's misspelled but it's not and
71:13 - it's where'd you spell all the time
71:14 - that's what I just did when I looked at
71:16 - component okay to run everything I did
71:28 - to have to change one of the tests
71:30 - earlier so when I changed the logo we
71:32 - had some some unit testing on that
71:35 - component that at bar component it was
71:38 - checking to see that the filename of the
71:40 - logo was correct so I I failed the test
71:47 - so if you are doing any work on on any
71:50 - of these repos keep that in mind to
71:53 - check the tests I mean you'll get an
71:56 - error it'll be pretty easy to tell
71:58 - what's what happened because the errors
72:02 - are our descriptive enough but sorry I'm
72:10 - trying to find this password and talk at
72:12 - the same time
72:17 - so there's a descriptive enough but
72:20 - that's where it might be and we do have
72:21 - two folders for tests so we have our
72:24 - unit tests and this folder up here this
72:29 - underscore test underscore and then our
72:32 - NN tests are in the e to e test folder
72:35 - alright so if you wanted to test an
72:39 - entire page do the end n test if it's
72:42 - just a component you do the unit test
72:46 - here alright let's just put that in
72:50 - there we are now it should work do the
72:55 - ssh ad so i don't have to worry about
72:57 - typing that in again okay now I'm going
73:01 - to answer as many questions as I can
73:03 - before 2:30
73:06 - it is 2:18 p.m. my time so let's see how
73:11 - far I can go here and where I leave off
73:19 - I know I left off in asked the question
73:22 - about where do I see myself in five
73:24 - years and that's I promise to answer
73:26 - that first so let's do that
73:29 - so in five years Wow five years in five
73:36 - years I will have a teenager that's
73:40 - crazy and it will be I'll be 37 Wow only
73:53 - 37 crazy in five years my beard might be
73:59 - a lot more gray so depending on what the
74:02 - style is maybe I'll do like that dyeing
74:04 - my hair silver thing that people are
74:06 - doing now but as far as where it goes I
74:11 - I don't know we'll see
74:12 - maybe I'll still be here maybe I won't I
74:17 - actually I'm gonna let you in on
74:19 - something that I haven't told very many
74:21 - people I have a job interview for a
74:23 - company in Pittsburgh next week so
74:29 - somebody at that company found my stuff
74:32 - on stackoverflow and check me out online
74:34 - and I wanted to set up a meeting so I
74:37 - had a phone call I'm gonna have to
74:39 - finish a coding like puzzle this weekend
74:43 - and submit that and then I'm gonna go in
74:46 - and meet their team so my my job would
74:50 - be full stack engineer if I get this
74:53 - position so I don't know where I'll be
74:57 - in five years I like it I love the
74:59 - people here in my department so it would
75:05 - be hard when I asked my my kids about it
75:08 - about what I should do my son who's
75:11 - eight years old said you shouldn't take
75:13 - the new job I asked him why he said
75:16 - because you like going to work and
75:19 - seeing your friends so it's like I do I
75:23 - like the people but I can't count on the
75:25 - people being here forever either so if I
75:27 - stay for that and then they all got
75:29 - different jobs where would I would I be
75:31 - so anyway that's a possibility yeah
75:42 - odds are I'll still be somewhere in this
75:44 - area like geographically because I still
75:47 - have my parents and my grandparents live
75:49 - here and I want my kids to grow up
75:51 - knowing they're their great-grandparents
75:54 - and and their grandparents so that's
75:56 - gonna be that's gonna be there I would
76:00 - really like though to be speaking at
76:02 - more conferences and I'd like to be
76:05 - doing more of this I know this is all
76:09 - volunteer right now probably not ever
76:11 - gonna be like a career for me but I
76:15 - really do like doing this I like helping
76:17 - people learn more about coding so
76:20 - hopefully I can I can do more
76:23 - I mean maybe branch out and and do some
76:25 - more videos or who knows but if in five
76:31 - years I'm still sitting here or in some
76:33 - similar office talking to you all I'll
76:37 - be very happy so hope
76:40 - that was a decent answer also I'm gonna
76:44 - be huge in five years like like
76:47 - bodybuilder huge like I've been working
76:49 - out in my basement and I don't keep
76:54 - track how much weight I lift but it
76:57 - seems impressive to my kids my kids
77:04 - think I'm really strong so don't don't
77:08 - tell them otherwise if you ever get a
77:09 - chance to see him just let him think
77:11 - that for now alright thanks for that
77:14 - question and it was actually kind of fun
77:16 - I didn't I've never really thought about
77:18 - that till you asked it so I think that
77:21 - was a good question for me
77:33 - see
77:45 - Oh Nicky says there is that that lorem
77:48 - ipsum generator that like works inside
77:51 - your editor only works between JSX tag
77:56 - not inside props that makes sense I
77:59 - guess I could do it elsewhere and then
78:02 - just copy and paste it in really quick
78:05 - John Henson says does this project use
78:09 - code splitting or will it use code
78:10 - splitting import for these large
78:12 - components you've got on the go that
78:15 - would be cool that would probably be a
78:17 - feature that may or may not make it in
78:19 - before we launch depending on what date
78:21 - gets set for me to launch which just as
78:23 - an aside it's kind of silly that the
78:26 - launch date is now being set by people
78:28 - who haven't even seen the website who
78:33 - who don't do any work with website so
78:35 - once you think I don't know I mean I
78:39 - don't know everything about the
78:40 - organization I'm sure there's a lot of
78:42 - things going on I don't know about that
78:43 - they're taking into consideration but
78:45 - how can you set a launch date for a
78:47 - product without ever even seeing the
78:49 - product or knowing how close it actually
78:51 - is to launching anyway hopefully after
78:54 - these meetings
78:55 - we'll be on the same page and and we get
78:59 - a launch date in but anyway a little bit
79:02 - off top of the question
79:04 - but anyway John I yeah I haven't done a
79:07 - lot with code splitting I think it's a
79:09 - great idea and I'd love to put it in
79:11 - this project at some point
79:23 - let's see
79:32 - John Hanson said asymmetry and web
79:34 - design takes guts we've been programmed
79:36 - way before the web and computers to
79:38 - expect symmetrical balance and yeah I
79:41 - everybody's like that but like let's
79:45 - let's make it a bit bigger just to see
79:47 - because on mobile you can't really tell
79:49 - but I'll just make this full stream
79:53 - right we have this full screen other
79:59 - than like the weird purple color was
80:01 - just throwing everything off right now
80:03 - I don't think that that's that weird to
80:06 - have this off-center a little bit like I
80:10 - really I like that like to be honest
80:14 - with you
80:15 - I kind of want to see if I can do it
80:17 - right here in the hero section and just
80:19 - just have it off-center like that
80:21 - everybody does this right I'm gonna
80:25 - maybe try to do it like that and see
80:27 - people are gonna freak out but I just
80:31 - wanna see what it looks like I don't
80:34 - know I think that would be cool actually
80:35 - did that for a site I made for a client
80:37 - before is I had hero sections with
80:40 - titles but the titles were like I think
80:43 - they were either down here or up here or
80:45 - something so I did not have them
80:46 - centered they were over here they had
80:48 - just a slight margin it what's nice
80:51 - about that is that you can clearly see
80:54 - the title it's in that where they say
80:56 - that F zone that everybody looks at and
80:58 - then you can clearly see the image as
81:02 - well I don't know we'll see I I know
81:06 - I'll get pushback from that but you got
81:09 - you gotta try to push stuff right if you
81:11 - just make the same website over and over
81:12 - again like it's it's boring and I don't
81:19 - you you're like potentially depriving
81:21 - your users of something that's a better
81:23 - user experience or looks nicer you know
81:26 - you got to try different things that's
81:28 - the way I feel at least
81:36 - Nikki says using the golden ratio makes
81:39 - that bit of asymmetry look better the
81:41 - golden ratio is super interesting oh
81:42 - yeah you know what you're right you're
81:44 - right Nikki maybe I'm gonna have to read
81:47 - up more on that and how I can apply it
81:49 - in here I imagine it's not it's a little
81:52 - bit tricky since we're gonna have
81:54 - different screen sizes but we should be
81:57 - able to get it to work with percentage
81:58 - with hey Quincy was in here I don't know
82:05 - if Quincy still here but if you are
82:07 - how's it going Chloe thanks for watching
82:11 - the Quincy says watching Jessica Plus
82:14 - listening to free code can't radio at
82:15 - the same time oh that's awesome so if
82:19 - you haven't listened to it yet free code
82:21 - camp has this radio station going like I
82:23 - think the goal is 24/7 so I don't know
82:27 - if we're there yet but it's it's pretty
82:30 - much every time I've checked it's been
82:31 - it's been playing so check it out it has
82:35 - music from from campers from free code
82:39 - campers and it's it's cool so you check
82:43 - it out and go in the chat chat with
82:46 - people there's always been at least 20
82:48 - people every time I've been in there so
82:50 - it's pretty fun
83:00 - let's see I see some more people saying
83:03 - hello a house with one I might have to
83:06 - but have to go really soon I'm really
83:11 - glad that I committed that and pushed it
83:13 - so I don't have to worry about it ah
83:15 - let's see
83:20 - Raphael asks what do you use for user
83:24 - management in react we really haven't
83:29 - done anything with with user management
83:31 - and reacts so I can't really say we
83:36 - haven't had a project that needed that
83:39 - the only the closest we came is we have
83:42 - a project that isn't it isn't live yet
83:45 - it's still in in development and we've
83:48 - had implemented like a password this
83:50 - login system but we like we've tested it
83:55 - it works but we've done nothing in terms
83:57 - of using that information for anything
84:00 - other than just logging people in so I
84:02 - guess I don't really have a great a
84:05 - great answer for that I apologize
84:14 - now innocent do not be upset that was
84:16 - when I was talking about that phone call
84:17 - yeah I'm not upset I mean I I'm not
84:20 - gonna lie
84:21 - calls like that I mean you they don't
84:24 - make you feel good right any time
84:27 - anybody is is not polite you don't feel
84:30 - good but it didn't get me down like I'm
84:34 - not it's not gonna stay with me for a
84:38 - long time I mean it kind of depends like
84:42 - you all know a battle depression if I
84:44 - happen to be really depressed right now
84:46 - something like that would probably seem
84:49 - a lot more you know terrible to me right
84:52 - now but I'm feeling pretty good talking
84:56 - with you all helps me feel better so it
84:58 - actually happened at a great time
84:59 - because I believe I'll be right back and
85:01 - talk to you all so I'll be alright
85:10 - alright looks like the size 18 font you
85:14 - all think is is better so awesome I'm
85:19 - definitely with you on that Jay Ryan
85:27 - Rock says the Berg unlimited for many
85:29 - sandwiches yeah if you've never been to
85:32 - Pittsburgh for Manny brothers
85:36 - restaurants have these sandwiches that
85:38 - I've like french fries on them and it's
85:40 - like a Pittsburgh thing I guess they're
85:43 - really good Oh
85:46 - Quincy said awesome good luck with the
85:48 - interview thank you I appreciate that
85:53 - all right Tiffany wait says hey I'm in
85:56 - the burgh Oh awesome Tiffany that's cool
86:01 - I always think like if I'm gonna be in
86:05 - an area I should definitely let you all
86:07 - know first and then if anybody wants to
86:09 - like have a little Meetup that would be
86:12 - cool so maybe I'll have to do a better
86:15 - job of remembering that anytime I travel
86:17 - or anything but I'm actually not that
86:19 - far away from Pittsburgh like I can get
86:21 - to the airport in like thirty five
86:24 - minutes like not not speeding
86:27 - anything just go on the regular fees so
86:30 - so anything on the western side of
86:32 - Pittsburgh is less than an hour for me
86:34 - to get to and then like the other side
86:38 - of Pittsburgh the eastern side takes me
86:40 - a little longer but if there's ever any
86:42 - meetups or anything going on in
86:43 - Pittsburgh that you all know about let
86:45 - me know I if I can I'd love to make it
86:58 - hi I'm Jay Ryan rocks got timed out for
87:02 - the for the bots for using cabs I also
87:08 - say good luck thanks I appreciate it
87:13 - I'm mission says good luck awesome
87:26 - Quincy said when we eventually get a
87:28 - chance to meet up in person and I
87:29 - definitely like to hit the weights with
87:31 - you yeah that would be cool
87:34 - that would be cool I was feeling you you
87:36 - definitely can lift more than me
87:38 - I just started getting back into it a
87:40 - month ago so this has been a month and
87:44 - it's like 4:00 on Monday it was four
87:47 - weeks I've worked out every single day
87:50 - for the last four weeks so cardio
87:56 - everyday and then I don't always lift
88:00 - but I've only like some things I just do
88:03 - like an ab workout so I don't really do
88:05 - weights but I usually get in weights
88:10 - like four times a week so anyway I'm
88:14 - excited about that
88:24 - I'm fishin s can you get into specifics
88:27 - about telling what the puzzle is about
88:30 - yeah the puzzle is I need to set up I
88:33 - can use any language I want but I need
88:36 - to make a program where it makes some
88:39 - type of data structure that represents a
88:41 - seating area so a certain amount of rows
88:45 - and columns of seats of chairs and then
88:48 - it needs to be able to I can give it
88:51 - numbers of seats that I want and it can
88:54 - reserve those seats and then I could
88:56 - give it just like a number so I could
88:57 - say okay I want five seats all together
89:00 - and it can find the best five seats that
89:03 - are available and reserve that so
89:05 - assuming that the front row Center is
89:07 - the best it'll use like a man what does
89:11 - it call Manhattan something I can't
89:13 - remain hatton distance or something to
89:16 - determine where the seats are so I have
89:18 - everything done up to the point where
89:21 - you give it a number and it gives you
89:24 - the seats so right now it's all command
89:27 - line so it just asks you questions on
89:28 - the command line and you type the
89:30 - answers back but if I have time I'd
89:33 - really like to build a front-end to it
89:34 - because I think it's not part of the
89:36 - instructions but honestly if I was going
89:40 - to build that to be more to be useful to
89:42 - more people it would be better if it had
89:44 - a front end that was a web app than just
89:47 - being a command line tool because most
89:49 - people don't use the command line right
89:50 - so anyway we'll see see how that goes
89:55 - but that's basically what I mean it's
89:58 - not it's not super complicated when I
90:00 - when you break it down into like the
90:02 - parts so hopefully I can get it finished
90:06 - up you know tomorrow morning and then
90:08 - that's really all the time I have to
90:10 - probe to do anything this weekend with
90:12 - it is tomorrow morning let's see what
90:16 - time it is okay my kids school is
90:19 - actually just let out right now so all
90:24 - right I'm really I'm really sorry that
90:29 - I'm not going to be able to get to all
90:31 - the questions so if you have a question
90:33 - that I didn't get to please put it in
90:36 - the comments
90:36 - this video or send me a message on
90:39 - Twitter or Instagram or something and I
90:42 - will answer your question but I have to
