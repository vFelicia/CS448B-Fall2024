00:00 - in this video i'm introducing two more
00:02 - algebraic laws for sets associativity
00:05 - and commutativity
00:06 - associativity is uh essentially just
00:09 - saying that we can regroup
00:11 - uh the sets that we are talking about so
00:15 - a intersection
00:16 - b intersection c that is a intersecting
00:20 - with the set b intersection c
00:22 - is equal to the set a intersection b
00:25 - intersection c
00:27 - and if you look at the definitions of uh
00:31 - intersection you can actually go through
00:32 - and figure out why this is and i'm
00:35 - pretty sure you'll be able to do that
00:36 - based on the videos that uh you've
00:38 - already watched
00:39 - and the same is true for the union
00:42 - uh commutativity is essentially just
00:44 - saying that we can um switch which side
00:48 - our sets are
00:49 - relative to the the operation so a
00:51 - intersection b is the same thing as b
00:53 - intersection a and the same thing is a
00:55 - union b is equal to b union a
00:58 - so if we look at the actual definition
01:00 - we have
01:00 - a intersection b
01:02 - is defined as the set containing
01:04 - elements x such that x is an element of
01:06 - a and x is an element of b and that's
01:09 - going to equal the set containing
01:11 - elements x such that x is an element of
01:13 - b and x is an element of a so if you
01:15 - just look at these uh the conditions for
01:18 - these for the set builder notation here
01:20 - it's essentially just a
01:21 - argument of grammar at this point so
01:24 - basic english will tell you that you can
01:27 - just switch which side that you have
01:29 - these on
