00:00 - in my last video on animation i
00:02 - demonstrated how to create an animation
00:04 - using set interval and element.animate
00:08 - in this video i will demonstrate another
00:10 - way called request animation frame this
00:14 - way of animating is similar to set
00:16 - interval but is more optimized for
00:18 - animation the benefits of request
00:20 - animation frame over set interval are
00:23 - the browser can optimize it so
00:25 - animations will be smoother animations
00:28 - and inactive tabs will stop allowing the
00:30 - cpu to chill
00:32 - and it's more battery friendly the
00:34 - element.animate method discussed in my
00:37 - last video is simpler and has better
00:39 - performance than request animation frame
00:41 - however it's not as widely supported yet
00:44 - so let's see what this code is going to
00:45 - do if you look on the side you'll see
00:47 - what happens when i hit the toggle
00:48 - button it starts this animation
00:52 - and i see it just repeats but if i hit
00:54 - the toggle button again it stops the
00:55 - animation
00:56 - and then i can press it again to start
00:58 - it again or stop it again so it's all
01:01 - happening because of this window.request
01:04 - animation frame
01:06 - this method tells the browser that you
01:07 - wish to perform the animation and
01:09 - request that the browser call a specific
01:11 - function to update an animation before
01:14 - the next repaint
01:15 - so
01:16 - in this example it's calling the step
01:19 - method and the number of callbacks is
01:21 - usually 60 times per second but will
01:24 - generally match the display refresh rate
01:26 - in most web browsers
01:28 - and you can see in the step method right
01:30 - here the callback method is past a time
01:33 - stamp which is the time the callback
01:36 - begins to run so let's actually go
01:38 - through the whole thing you can see up
01:40 - here we have the button toggle animation
01:43 - and it's going to run this function down
01:44 - here toggle animation so this is either
01:47 - choosing to start the animation or stop
01:49 - the animation
01:50 - so
01:51 - if the toggle's off then we're going to
01:54 - set to true and then we're going to run
01:57 - the animation
01:58 - window.requestanimationframe and then
02:00 - we're going to call the step function so
02:01 - that's how the step function initially
02:03 - starts
02:04 - however if it's already running we are
02:07 - going to
02:08 - else we're going to set the toggle to
02:10 - equals false
02:12 - and we're going to cancel animation
02:14 - frame
02:15 - so if you call this method cancel
02:17 - animation frame and then put in a stop
02:19 - id it's just going to stop the animation
02:22 - so this stop id comes from up here
02:25 - whenever you call
02:26 - window.requestanimationframe it's going
02:28 - to return an id
02:29 - and then if you'd call
02:31 - cancelanimationframe on that id it stops
02:34 - the animation
02:35 - so let's go back up to the step function
02:38 - like i said it's going to take its time
02:39 - stamp and then
02:41 - you can see some of these variables were
02:43 - initialized up here if start has not
02:45 - been assigned yet
02:46 - or
02:47 - the progress is more than 400 star is
02:50 - going to equal timestamp
02:51 - so progress this is how we're going to
02:53 - determine what pixel we want the square
02:56 - to be at on the screen so we're just
02:59 - going to take the timestamp that was
03:01 - passed in minus start and you know the
03:03 - time step will always be increasing so
03:05 - when we do time stamp minus the start
03:08 - which was the first time stamp
03:10 - it's going to slowly be increasing as
03:13 - the time stamp increases
03:15 - now that's going to be milliseconds so
03:17 - if we divide that by 10 it will equal
03:19 - the number of pixels we want and we're
03:21 - going to add 50 just because we don't
03:23 - want the square to start at the very top
03:25 - of the page we want it to be below the
03:27 - button
03:28 - and then we're just going to set
03:30 - element.style.top to equal
03:33 - progress plus px so the number of pixels
03:37 - that we've gotten from this progress
03:39 - variable
03:40 - and then at the end of the step function
03:42 - we call it again with the
03:44 - window.requestanimationframe and pass in
03:46 - step so this is just going to keep
03:47 - calling over and over again and every
03:49 - time it's called it's going to pass in a
03:51 - new timestamp and that's what's going to
03:54 - increase the number and the progress
03:57 - which will
03:58 - increase the the top style and we'll
04:01 - slowly make it go the square go down
04:04 - so let's see that again see it's just
04:06 - going down
04:07 - and then when we
04:09 - toggle it
04:10 - it's going to call this cancel animation
04:12 - with the stop id and it's going to stop
04:14 - well thanks for watching that's request
04:16 - animation frame don't forget to
04:18 - subscribe and remember use your code for
04:21 - good
