00:00 - hey everyone what's up welcome back to
00:02 - code 30 things in 30 days with css3
00:05 - today is day number two and we're going
00:07 - to be doing a lesson that i call sexy
00:10 - typography so over here in the browser
00:13 - you can see um
00:15 - basically in the final result you can
00:16 - kind of see
00:17 - what it is we're going to be building so
00:19 - in css3 what's kind of neat is you can
00:21 - you can make some really cool text
00:24 - effects uh just with css3 you don't need
00:26 - photoshop or anything like that
00:28 - so
00:29 - i wanted to highlight a couple of those
00:31 - things in css3 in today's lesson it's
00:33 - pretty simple shouldn't take us too long
00:35 - but i think it's gonna be fun and might
00:37 - kind of uh give you a few ideas of what
00:40 - you can do with css3 on your own
00:42 - websites and applications and so on all
00:44 - right so before we start coding you're
00:46 - gonna need the course files the final
00:48 - course files so uh in this module
00:50 - there's gonna be a lesson uh entitled
00:53 - download the course files or whatever it
00:55 - is that i name it at the time and you
00:57 - could just click on that link it'll take
00:58 - you to a dropbox link it should direct
00:59 - download that
01:01 - today's course files which should be
01:03 - entitled to dash sexy typography there
01:06 - will be an index file a sandbox.css file
01:10 - and a final.css file and that's what you
01:13 - need for today the index you don't need
01:15 - to concern yourself with other than
01:16 - looking at seeing how the markup is laid
01:19 - out
01:20 - sandbox.css is where you're going to be
01:23 - coding your own css and then the final
01:25 - css is what you're going to use for
01:26 - reference it gives you the final result
01:28 - over here in the browser you can see
01:30 - down here you can use it for reference
01:31 - that's what we're going to try to build
01:33 - the final css is what gets you that
01:35 - result
01:36 - okay so go ahead and download that you
01:38 - can pause the video do whatever you need
01:39 - to do and once you're done with that
01:41 - come back open it up in your code editor
01:42 - and let's get started so first things
01:45 - first in your sandbox.css uh open up a
01:48 - new line
01:49 - and let's uh get coding so we need to
01:52 - code the first uh example here cool
01:55 - shadow i call it basically has this cool
01:57 - retro shadow
01:59 - that kind of offsets behind and off to
02:01 - the bottom right of the text and it's
02:04 - this cool effect and that's purely css
02:06 - so let's do that it's pretty
02:08 - straightforward and simple
02:10 - all you got to do is uh select that
02:12 - class so in our index let's find out
02:13 - what it's called shadow typo is the
02:15 - class i called it
02:17 - shadow dash typo
02:20 - and then we're gonna position that
02:23 - relative
02:26 - like so
02:27 - uh we're gonna display inline block
02:30 - uh font size
02:32 - uh we we need to make that quite large
02:34 - so 4m
02:35 - in fact let's make it for rem
02:38 - to be consistent with css3 text
02:41 - transform we want that to be uppercase
02:43 - all uppercase the color let's go double
02:46 - o
02:48 - b3b4 and uh and then here's where the
02:51 - magic happens so let me just save this
02:53 - and head over here to the browser we're
02:55 - basically halfway there we're actually
02:57 - 99 of the way there
02:59 - it looks pretty much the same as down
03:01 - here uh although four rem made this
03:03 - quite a bit smaller so me head back to
03:04 - our code editor maybe make that
03:06 - something like six ram let's see what
03:08 - that does
03:09 - okay go back it's a little bit big but
03:11 - whatever you want to do it's up to you
03:13 - now all we need to do is add
03:15 - a text shadow
03:16 - in css3
03:18 - but two text shadows so we're going to
03:20 - have a transparent text shadow behind
03:22 - the letters and then another text shadow
03:25 - behind that one that gives that kind of
03:26 - separation so
03:28 - head back here to your css your
03:30 - sandbox.css and we're going to go text
03:34 - shadow
03:35 - three pixels three pixels uh that's
03:38 - vertical and horizontal offset three
03:40 - pixels and three pixels so we're gonna
03:41 - go down and over
03:42 - zero pixels we don't want any blur and
03:44 - the number is going to be e 7 e e f 1.
03:47 - that is this color of the background
03:49 - container so it's gonna you're not going
03:51 - to see anything at all on purpose
03:53 - comma
03:54 - one more value in here eight pixels
03:57 - eight pixels so offsetting this eight
03:59 - pixels down and eight pixels over
04:01 - and then the blur zero we don't want any
04:03 - blur on this whatsoever and then we're
04:05 - gonna do rgba for uh red green blue
04:08 - alpha
04:09 - and zero zero zero
04:12 - so this is like um i'm gonna give us
04:14 - black
04:15 - but then the alpha channel
04:17 - 0.1 which is going to make it like 10 so
04:20 - it's going to be very very transparent
04:22 - so i'm going to be 10 visible
04:24 - semicolons save that head over to your
04:27 - browser and you can see you're done
04:29 - just like that pretty cool text shadow
04:32 - effect you got that you can see here you
04:33 - got that three pixel offset and then the
04:35 - eight pixel offset okay so that was it
04:37 - for the cool shadow version let's go
04:39 - down to the 3d type we're going to make
04:40 - a bit of a three-dimensional effect so
04:42 - over here in the browser this one's kind
04:44 - of cool it's angled it's got this like
04:47 - depth and then like kind of a
04:49 - layer at the back that's a bit darker so
04:52 - you can see here you got the text
04:53 - on an angle a bit of a depth going on
04:56 - there like it pops out and then there's
04:58 - like a layer at the back that's darker
05:00 - and then this like very subtle shadow
05:03 - it's very simple we're just playing with
05:05 - some transforms
05:07 - and some text shadow very simple so
05:09 - let's go back here to our code editor
05:11 - sandbox.css all right so we're going to
05:13 - select
05:14 - that class and that's going to be called
05:17 - 3d typo i wrote 3d
05:21 - literally
05:22 - because you can't start a class with a
05:23 - number so just put 3d
05:25 - 3d dash
05:27 - typo like that and then we're going to
05:29 - start with the font size let's do 6 rem
05:32 - again
05:33 - and then we're going to say text
05:35 - transform
05:36 - uppercase and then the color is going to
05:39 - be
05:40 - f2
05:43 - 395
05:45 - oops a
05:47 - and then we're going to do some
05:48 - transforms so i'm going to start off
05:49 - with the transform here and then we're
05:51 - going to say skew
05:53 - is the first value of the transform
05:55 - property
05:56 - skew
05:59 - and then two values x and y minus 5
06:01 - degrees
06:03 - comma
06:04 - minus five degrees that's gonna angle it
06:07 - and then we're gonna rotate it
06:10 - five degrees
06:12 - whoops that's gotta be connected just
06:14 - like that so if i save that and check it
06:16 - out over here in the browser it
06:17 - basically looks like it's italic but you
06:19 - can see when i highlight it my cursor
06:21 - highlight is actually on an angle and
06:22 - when you highlight text that's italic it
06:25 - doesn't necessarily do that so so this
06:27 - is actually being angled and rotated a
06:30 - little bit if i were to be a bit more
06:31 - dramatic you'd see you know that this is
06:35 - actually so i'm going to rotate it even
06:37 - more like
06:38 - 25 degrees so check it out
06:41 - you can see that that's what i'm doing
06:43 - so i'm going to put that back to 5
06:44 - degrees on the rotate and then i'm going
06:46 - to do the degrees five negative five and
06:49 - negative five
06:52 - and we're good to go okay so now because
06:55 - transform
06:57 - is css3 sometimes some browsers don't
06:59 - necessarily
07:00 - know what that is so we got to use
07:02 - browser prefixes you can check out
07:04 - kenyuse.com and see how
07:07 - valid transform property is in css3 and
07:09 - how cross browser compatible it is but
07:11 - i'm just going to for good practice put
07:13 - in webkit transform
07:15 - and essentially just copy this it's
07:17 - exactly the same thing and just paste
07:20 - that in
07:21 - so same thing
07:23 - save it and now let's keep going so
07:25 - we're going to do the transform origin
07:27 - so i want to change the origin of where
07:30 - it rotates and where it's transforming
07:33 - because i'm pretty sure currently it
07:35 - goes from the top left i think that's
07:36 - the default transform origin
07:38 - so where it transforms from and where it
07:40 - rotates from so that's that you can
07:43 - change where you want that origin to be
07:46 - so i'm going to say center
07:48 - center
07:50 - so save that
07:52 - you would notice this more if i change
07:54 - the values of the skew and the rotate to
07:56 - something more dramatic you'd see that
07:58 - it's rotating from the center so why
08:00 - don't i give you an example of that so
08:01 - i'm going to comment this out 20 and 20.
08:03 - so if i were to say bottom right and
08:05 - save and go back here you can see it's
08:06 - actually the origin is in a separate
08:08 - spot
08:09 - versus like top
08:12 - left and then go back here you can see
08:14 - now it's in a different spot so it's
08:15 - actually
08:16 - or the origin of the transform is in
08:19 - different positions of the element so we
08:20 - want center
08:22 - center so it's nice and centered uh
08:26 - perfect now back in the code editor here
08:29 - we're gonna copy this but then have the
08:31 - browser prefix version transform origin
08:34 - but it's gonna be
08:35 - webkit transform origin and now we need
08:38 - to just do some text shadows it's very
08:40 - simple we're just going to do a lot of
08:41 - text shadows in one text shadow property
08:44 - here so text shadow we're going to say 1
08:47 - pixel 1 pixel we've done this before d
08:50 - 10
08:51 - e 31 i'm going to copy that value
08:54 - because i'm going to use it a lot now if
08:55 - i stopped there you wouldn't see much
08:58 - over here it's just a slight darker
08:59 - shadow behind it so let me save this oh
09:03 - i'm going to change this back to 5
09:04 - degrees 5 all around perfect okay so i'm
09:07 - gonna put a comma and return
09:09 - go back and under here
09:11 - and i'm gonna do another couple values
09:12 - two pixels two pixels i'm gonna paste
09:15 - that uh
09:16 - value here
09:18 - copy this i'm gonna put a
09:20 - comma and we're gonna change this from
09:23 - two and two to three and three now you
09:25 - catch the idea i'm gonna do this up
09:26 - until seven so just
09:28 - do that
09:29 - [Music]
09:31 - there we go so save that uh semicolon at
09:33 - the end check it out and see what we got
09:34 - so far perfect it's got that kind of
09:36 - angle depth kind of that pops out looks
09:39 - great but there's still more to it we
09:40 - have another layer so let's go back here
09:42 - to our editor
09:43 - comma i'm going to paste and change this
09:46 - to 8 and 8 but change the color value to
09:50 - a darker salmony red color which is
09:52 - going to be 890920
09:54 - copy that value
09:56 - paste it a couple more times we're going
09:58 - to change this to 9 and 9 and 10 and 10.
10:03 - semicolon at the end check it out in
10:05 - your browser we basically finished it
10:06 - but there's one little element left and
10:08 - that's just kind of this broad blur in
10:10 - the background you can see here as a
10:12 - final example there's a bit of a
10:14 - background shadow an actual shadow back
10:16 - there that just
10:17 - gives it more depth it pops out more
10:19 - than up here
10:20 - so let's uh go back here and add one
10:23 - more value so a comma we're going to go
10:25 - 11 pixels 11 pixels but for the blur
10:27 - property 15 pixels so quite blurry very
10:30 - blurry in fact in rgba we're gonna do
10:33 - zero zero zero which is black
10:36 - but then another comma now we need the
10:38 - alpha channel we're gonna go 0.5 which
10:40 - is 50
10:41 - transparent
10:43 - semicolon save that head back over and
10:45 - there we are in the browser we're done
10:47 - 3d type we've got that depth we've got
10:49 - that little layer there that's darker
10:51 - and then the shadow in the background so
10:53 - we've got the cool shadow the retro
10:54 - style shadow there and then we've got
10:56 - the 3d type that pops out using text
10:59 - shadows so it's quite simple but it's
11:01 - just a matter of
11:02 - playing around with the values and and
11:04 - giving the illusion that you have
11:05 - three-dimensional text so all of this is
11:08 - done in css3 exclusively just
11:12 - you know a dozen or so lines of css
11:15 - very simple whereas if you were to do
11:17 - this in photoshop you'd have to make it
11:18 - in photoshop you'd have to export it for
11:20 - like retina and normal and then put the
11:23 - images and you're adding more bandwidth
11:25 - and
11:25 - it just takes too long just to create
11:27 - something you could just do
11:28 - simply in css3 so that is it for day two
11:32 - sexy typography a little bit simpler of
11:34 - a day today than yesterday day one was
11:36 - quite the beast but today is a simpler
11:40 - just to kind of give you a better
11:41 - breathing room before we get into some
11:42 - pretty awesome and difficult stuff as we
11:45 - go along in this journey hope you
11:46 - enjoyed day two i'll see you tomorrow in
11:48 - day number three peace cheers gotta go
11:51 - bye
11:52 - [Music]
