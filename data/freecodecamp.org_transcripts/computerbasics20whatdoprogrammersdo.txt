00:00 - hi it's Briana from free code camp in
00:02 - this video we are going to be talking
00:04 - about what programmers do programmers
00:07 - are also sometimes called coders
00:09 - developers or software engineers and
00:11 - what all of these people do is they take
00:14 - ideas and turn them into functional code
00:17 - now it's not just the creating the code
00:19 - it's also maintaining that code and all
00:21 - the things having to do with keeping it
00:23 - working and healthy talking about how a
00:25 - computer looks at code specifically
00:27 - JavaScript the computer looks at code
00:30 - one line at a time and as you're writing
00:33 - code you're going to notice these
00:34 - numbers on the left hand side the
00:36 - computer will literally go down line by
00:38 - line making sense of what each line has
00:41 - to say now what I've written here is not
00:43 - actually relevant in JavaScript there is
00:45 - no that feed method but the point of
00:48 - this is it does it looks at number one
00:50 - says oh that's a comment I'm going to
00:51 - ignore that and move on number two
00:53 - verbana equals new teacher it processes
00:55 - that and then moves on everything is
00:58 - done sequentially just straight down so
01:00 - if I were to try and write something up
01:02 - here that referenced something down here
01:05 - we might have a problem if you're going
01:06 - to reference something make sure the
01:08 - information that it needs is above it
01:10 - because it does go down linearly now
01:13 - that might be a little bit complicated
01:15 - really all you need to know is it just
01:17 - works down just like you would read a
01:20 - book The most important thing to take
01:22 - away from this video is programmers take
01:25 - ideas and break them down into little
01:27 - little tiny steps and write them in a
01:29 - way that the computer can understand
01:30 - them
