00:00 - hey everybody
00:01 - welcome to the free code camp
00:04 - 2018 top contributors party in dublin
00:09 - yeah
00:10 - here before we get started i have some
00:13 - very quick announcements
00:14 - uh things that are coming up very soon
00:16 - that i think everybody who's interested
00:18 - in free code camp should know first of
00:20 - all
00:22 - just like last year when free co camp
00:25 - participated in hacktoberfest
00:27 - and hacktoberfest is the month of
00:29 - october it's a big push to get people to
00:32 - contribute to open source
00:34 - last year free code camps guide
00:37 - was the
00:38 - number one most contributed to open
00:41 - source repo
00:43 - as part of hacktoberfest
00:47 - we're taking a lot of the existing
00:49 - repositories we've got learn we've got
00:51 - curriculum we've got the free codecamp
00:53 - slash recording at the main repository
00:56 - uh
00:57 - and then we've got the guide we're
00:58 - working
00:59 - to
01:00 - unify
01:01 - these
01:02 - repos into a single repository that will
01:05 - make it easier
01:07 - for everybody to get the local free code
01:09 - camp running
01:11 - a couple other announcements since you
01:13 - are watching this on the youtube channel
01:16 - according to like the youtube analytics
01:18 - we looked at free code camp is now the
01:21 - fastest growing programming
01:23 - youtube
01:24 - channel uh
01:28 - yeah and
01:29 - we are getting about 50 000 new
01:32 - subscribers a month if you create
01:35 - compelling videos about programming and
01:37 - you're interested we would love to help
01:40 - more people see your instagram content
01:43 - your videos so
01:45 - just reach out to us and we can make
01:48 - that happen but for us
01:50 - we want to put as many amazing
01:52 - videos on youtube as we can
01:54 - we're here in dublin we're at i've got a
01:57 - cool sign for it the huckle tree
02:00 - which is a really cool hipster name
02:04 - i'm gonna try to talk to as many of you
02:06 - all as possible and just interview you
02:08 - and learn more about you so
02:11 - hey
02:12 - i'm here with brianna swift
02:14 - you have been involved with freco camp
02:17 - since basically the beginning maybe you
02:18 - can just give us a high level overview
02:21 - of your involvement with free code camp
02:23 - and and your transition into being a
02:25 - developer
02:26 - yeah so i found free code camp uh while
02:29 - i was an elementary school music teacher
02:31 - i was trying to learn how to code
02:34 - i love kids i love teaching music but i
02:36 - knew it wasn't a career that i wanted to
02:38 - do forever so i was like what can i
02:40 - learn how to do
02:42 - without having to quit my job and go
02:43 - back to school because i couldn't afford
02:45 - to do that and i thought the people that
02:47 - make the internet are probably the first
02:49 - ones to put all of that information for
02:51 - free on the internet
02:53 - um so i did code academy mostly
02:55 - javascript type stuff and found my way
02:57 - onto free code camp
02:59 - i was really involved on twitter that
03:01 - was my only community because i was
03:02 - really kind of alone while i was
03:04 - learning
03:06 - and went through the free code camp
03:07 - challenges and
03:09 - as soon as i started doing that i
03:11 - started to get involved more in the chat
03:12 - room which there was no forum at that
03:14 - point and started doing some pair
03:15 - programming and streaming that
03:18 - so free code camp really not only taught
03:20 - me
03:21 - the fundamentals that i needed for
03:24 - you know for development and for
03:25 - software but also gave me a community
03:28 - and a place to
03:29 - you know commiserate almost with how
03:32 - hard it is to learn how to code and
03:35 - based on
03:36 - your videos on youtube and the skills
03:38 - that you were able to build up just
03:40 - learning the code on your own and
03:41 - through different communities
03:43 - you were able to eventually get a job
03:48 - can you talk a little bit about your job
03:49 - and how you got it
03:51 - yeah yes i work at github which is not
03:53 - where i thought i would be working when
03:55 - i started learning to code
03:56 - i'm a trainer so most of the time i'm
03:58 - talking to developers about how to use
04:00 - git and github so regardless of what
04:03 - language they're programming in
04:04 - regardless of what type of projects how
04:05 - big their team is everybody should
04:07 - probably be using version control and
04:10 - git is not the simplest thing to wrap
04:12 - your head around so it's a similar
04:13 - challenge to these computer science
04:15 - concepts like how can we make this
04:16 - simple and approachable
04:18 - um
04:19 - this you know that transition was weird
04:22 - because going from elementary school
04:23 - music teacher to working at github is
04:25 - kind of a jump
04:28 - but
04:29 - but i think working with those videos
04:31 - specifically and saying how can we take
04:32 - these difficult concepts and make them
04:34 - approachable to anybody is something
04:35 - that
04:37 - really primed me for working at github
04:39 - so i think even if somebody's going
04:40 - through free code camp and if you're
04:42 - going through free code camp and you're
04:43 - like i don't know if i necessarily see
04:44 - myself as a full-time developer
04:48 - that's okay like there are so many
04:50 - places for you that are perfect for you
04:53 - that you might just not know exist like
04:54 - i didn't know that this job existed but
04:56 - i love it
04:57 - awesome thanks again thank you quincy
05:00 - why don't you just tell us a little
05:02 - about yourself pete sure
05:04 - so my name is pete and i'm a data
05:05 - scientist based in london
05:09 - and i uh write for and help edit the
05:12 - medium publication i've been doing that
05:14 - since about october uh last year so
05:16 - almost a year now and it's it's really
05:18 - fun it's really interesting to see what
05:19 - articles we receive and and you know
05:21 - sort of curating them and helping them
05:22 - to you know the high standards we like
05:24 - to put up
05:25 - what is your editorial workflow like
05:29 - about how frequently will you check in
05:31 - and find articles that you're interested
05:32 - in editing and publishing
05:34 - i see so we do receive a lot of articles
05:36 - there's always something to work on
05:38 - um i i try and check in daily uh i
05:40 - actually take uh my lunch breaks at work
05:42 - uh as an opportunity to you know see
05:44 - what there is and review some of the
05:45 - articles and if i see one i think i can
05:47 - i can help you know edit them get to you
05:49 - know the standard we want then i'll you
05:52 - know i'll claim that article and in that
05:53 - evening i'll work on it and
05:55 - send it to abby for you know final
05:56 - review and publishing so that's
05:58 - thank you thanks peter
06:00 - have a seat richie
06:02 - just give us an overview of some of the
06:04 - things you do
06:05 - yeah so i mean
06:07 - we met a couple of years back
06:10 - you know
06:11 - free call cam was still in its early
06:12 - days and stuff
06:14 - so um so what i do currently is
06:18 - basically run meetups um i'm a core
06:21 - admin um
06:23 - for free call cam johannesburg
06:26 - uh there's a couple of other guys that
06:28 - some came and went and some are still
06:30 - there but some are dormant some are
06:31 - active we needed
06:33 - when needs be
06:35 - um but i'm generally like you know
06:37 - organize stuff and host the meetups
06:40 - themselves we're building uh we're
06:41 - building an events platform that'll make
06:43 - it easier for people in johannesburg
06:45 - when they're just using freecoatcamp to
06:48 - it'll remind them hey there's an event
06:50 - in uh you know at the nearby office uh
06:53 - where you're having your next event so
06:56 - i i'm optimistic that that will help
06:58 - even more people who are already in
07:00 - johannesburg who
07:02 - uh don't realize
07:04 - that you're having all these in-person
07:06 - events that will help get them involved
07:07 - as well
07:09 - absolutely
07:10 - um yeah i mean
07:14 - so like so
07:15 - another aspect of it i mean it's um we
07:17 - were talking about how else uh myself in
07:20 - the evidence we were talking about how
07:21 - else we can contribute like is is this
07:24 - all we can do
07:26 - you know is is that like how do we take
07:28 - it to the next level and i was like my
07:30 - response to that was like that's a very
07:31 - good question brother what do you think
07:34 - and um he's over there so he gave me his
07:38 - peace of mind but like for me i think
07:40 - for now is like we need to continue
07:42 - doing what we've been doing
07:44 - because
07:46 - personally i mean for me the the reason
07:48 - why i believe in this and why i'm still
07:50 - doing what i what i'm doing now
07:51 - is that i see value in this you know i
07:54 - truly believe like this
07:56 - is um
07:58 - one way that we can and i know it sounds
08:01 - very
08:02 - like up in the sky but like i really
08:04 - believe like this is one way of actually
08:06 - tackling poverty
08:08 - um and i see people that are frustrated
08:10 - in their jobs people that
08:13 - they just you know they just go to work
08:15 - just for the heck of it but they don't
08:17 - enjoy it you know and for me i strongly
08:19 - believe in that like you have to really
08:20 - enjoy what you do and i absolutely love
08:22 - what i'm doing right now and thanks to
08:24 - free code camp and i think the way just
08:27 - back to my original point was that um
08:29 - how to take it forward is first of all
08:31 - we need to keep doing what we're doing
08:33 - you know don't drop the standard and
08:35 - obviously think of other ways um of how
08:37 - we can improve it um whether it's um i
08:40 - don't know like just maybe writing
08:42 - articles if you would say you were doing
08:43 - like youtube stuff or you hosting
08:45 - meetups um maybe just you know think of
08:48 - other ways of contributing more or at
08:51 - least getting other people to feel the
08:53 - same passion that you have so that they
08:55 - can also continue and and contribute to
08:58 - the platform in in different ways
09:01 - richie it's been such a pleasure man
09:03 - thank you so much for flying out here
09:06 - well david you are a prolific uh
09:09 - writer among other things
09:11 - and
09:12 - i think you have a very interesting
09:13 - background
09:14 - can you tell the
09:16 - audience a little bit about yourself and
09:18 - how you got into coding and writing
09:20 - about code
09:21 - okay
09:22 - first of all quincy i'm really grateful
09:24 - to you that you created free code cam
09:26 - because i think it was really the major
09:28 - helper for me to switch my careers
09:30 - because as you mentioned i was working
09:32 - as a lawyer i have a law degree and then
09:33 - i was working as a lawyer for two years
09:36 - but then i got eventually a little bit
09:38 - frustrated and i was wondering what to
09:40 - do next so i was checking online courses
09:42 - and stuff and if i think first i checked
09:44 - some harvard course about cooking about
09:46 - molecular gastronomy and i spent like
09:48 - three months doing that but i said to me
09:50 - okay i cannot be cooked because i'm
09:52 - sweating and in the kitchen there's a
09:54 - lot of hot in here so i couldn't cook so
09:56 - i tried to watching for something else
09:58 - and then
09:59 - i find first some course on udemy about
10:03 - uh programming css html and javascript
10:05 - and i tried that
10:07 - but then it was just a tutorial you know
10:08 - building things that other people built
10:10 - so it was kind of it was great i got
10:12 - motivated but it was just the first
10:14 - level and then i discovered free code
10:16 - camp and those algorithms
10:18 - and it was basically a different
10:20 - dimension for me because before i was
10:22 - just creating stuff according to
10:24 - tutorials but with the with the
10:26 - algorithms i need to really understand
10:29 - and at first i got really frustrated
10:31 - because i think oh my god it's so
10:33 - difficult i cannot be developer but then
10:35 - it really just
10:37 - was better and better and finally i got
10:39 - really confident
10:40 - and really
10:42 - i started learning to code during the
10:44 - weekends and on the evenings
10:46 - and it eventually took me seven months
10:48 - to switch from a lawyer to developer
10:51 - just coding into on the weekends and the
10:53 - night so i'm really grateful for free
10:54 - coach ken because it really motivated me
10:56 - to see all the people doing the same
10:58 - thing
10:59 - is although so why i decide for
11:02 - contributing for free code cam by
11:03 - writing articles because
11:05 - you know a free code cam community
11:07 - helped me to become developer and i also
11:09 - wanted to contribute to it by
11:11 - by showing people concepts that were
11:13 - difficult for me so i try to like
11:15 - describe them in a way that are more
11:17 - understandable for me and in a way that
11:19 - i want them to be to see them when i
11:22 - learn them because there were no
11:23 - resources before
11:24 - yeah and that's i think the part of my
11:27 - story and maybe just
11:29 - the
11:30 - the main thing what i
11:32 - decided to change switch the careers was
11:33 - that as a lawyer i didn't see the
11:35 - results of my work
11:37 - and as a as a programmer i mean you
11:39 - write console.log and you see the result
11:41 - is it's so motivating you just write
11:44 - code and you see the result i love this
11:46 - and this is why i love programming
11:48 - cheers
11:50 - so tell us a little bit about uh about
11:52 - what you're working on out in portugal
11:55 - uh eduardo and you're leading the study
11:57 - group there
11:58 - well uh i i first knew free code camp in
12:01 - the beginning of 2017
12:03 - and i was a civil engineering
12:06 - and i was not happy with my career i
12:08 - wanted to reboot into into programming
12:11 - and when i'm at free code camp i'm at
12:13 - the right path
12:15 - uh to start learning how to program i've
12:17 - tried a lot of boot camps without effort
12:21 - but with free code camp it was very very
12:23 - easy to to follow follow up
12:26 - and and at the same time that i was
12:30 - studying
12:31 - uh i started to motivate people to study
12:33 - with me
12:34 - i started at the same time as jerome
12:36 - enrique and together we started the
12:39 - study group in our
12:41 - city
12:42 - uh and we impersonated also the starting
12:45 - of the study group in lisbon the capital
12:48 - of portugal
12:50 - and we are doing that effort
12:53 - every week
12:55 - even after we get got our jobs
12:58 - yeah i've rebooted my career in
13:02 - five months studying
13:04 - more or less 10 hours per day but it was
13:06 - uh
13:07 - nats it was five months and i got from
13:10 - civil engineering to a front-end
13:11 - developer
13:13 - how many people within your study group
13:15 - have gotten developer jobs do you think
13:17 - yeah
13:19 - first quincy let me tell you that we are
13:21 - in the south of portugal so it's a small
13:23 - town like 50 000
13:25 - inhabitants and
13:27 - in the last year we got five five
13:29 - developers ready to start working and
13:31 - they started working so i think it's a
13:33 - nice percentage
13:35 - so basically one out of 10 000 people in
13:38 - your town has gotten a developer job
13:40 - thanks largely to your efforts and your
13:42 - community outreach
13:44 - you're great yeah it was nice to meet
13:46 - you robert have a seat man thank you
13:49 - thank you
13:49 - you lead the free cocaine vienna group
13:52 - along with daniel deutsch who who
13:54 - couldn't make it uh he's a student
13:56 - uh tell us a little bit about the
13:59 - origins of free code camp vienna which i
14:01 - think you said is about three years old
14:02 - now yeah it is it is um
14:05 - yeah it's like there's so much to say
14:06 - but
14:07 - um
14:08 - it basically started i i
14:12 - now have a developer job and i mainly
14:14 - attribute that to free code camp which
14:16 - is awesome
14:17 - and when i started as a student
14:19 - shortly after there's this there was i
14:22 - think it still is that this is getting
14:23 - started guide and you're getting courage
14:24 - to check up your local group there was
14:26 - no local group but there was a nice
14:27 - guide saying if there is no local group
14:29 - start a facebook group this is how you
14:31 - do it so i did
14:32 - uh and then
14:34 - no one came so i asked my wife to join i
14:36 - invited her we were two then like this
14:38 - is probably just in the span of a couple
14:39 - of days
14:40 - there were still no more people joining
14:42 - so i got impatient so i think i texted
14:44 - you on gitzer or something i was like i
14:46 - don't know if quincy larson will reply
14:47 - to me but he replied and it was awesome
14:50 - and i was asking can i start a
14:51 - meetup.com group because i knew meetups
14:53 - from my city there's a quite a bit of
14:55 - them
14:56 - thinking that that's the way i could get
14:58 - more people involved because i wanted to
14:59 - meet other students right
15:01 - um and then i did that and you replied
15:04 - like yeah of course sure just keep in
15:05 - mind it cost money and stuff and i was
15:06 - like that's fine
15:08 - so that's basically how it started in
15:10 - the format that we have now
15:12 - we've been going almost three years like
15:14 - this i think november or december
15:17 - take care all right thank you well
15:18 - elephant thank you so much for flying in
15:20 - from greece
15:22 - you are a very prominent person in the
15:24 - freco camp community especially recently
15:27 - you've been live streaming a whole lot
15:29 - of
15:30 - videos you've been creating videos
15:33 - on things like angular
15:35 - it's
15:36 - it's incredibly helpful tell us a little
15:38 - about how you got into tech and how you
15:41 - started
15:42 - deciding to record all this and share
15:44 - all this knowledge okay
15:46 - uh well i wanted to learn and firstly i
15:49 - wanted to learn
15:50 - for me and for myself but i knew that
15:54 - eventually i wanted to find a job and i
15:57 - wanted to be sure that everything i know
15:59 - i can also uh like
16:02 - go to another person and maybe teach
16:04 - them so i said okay how can i do that so
16:07 - let's start coding in my computer as
16:10 - always and then i'm going to record
16:11 - these videos and if they're very good
16:13 - then i'm going to upload them so
16:16 - basically that's how i started i wanted
16:18 - to pass this knowledge to other people
16:20 - and make sure that i also know these
16:22 - things thank you very much
16:25 - ben is
16:27 - a prolific contributor to free code camp
16:29 - i think i've spent more time pairing
16:31 - with him than pretty much anybody in the
16:33 - free code camp community
16:36 - uh gosh let me let me let me just let me
16:39 - just recount some of the things you
16:40 - worked on so
16:41 - you were
16:42 - you were very heavily involved in the
16:44 - javascript
16:46 - curriculum which pretty much everybody
16:47 - who's watching this has probably tried
16:48 - at some point um
16:51 - you created the challenge-o-matic which
16:53 - was the tool to make it easier to
16:54 - contribute challenges well tell us a
16:56 - little about yourself you're here in
16:58 - dublin right yeah yeah so i am based
17:00 - here i am currently kind of a college
17:02 - student uh detergent my degree is all
17:05 - work placement
17:07 - so i'm currently a working man for a
17:09 - year
17:10 - in kernel development actually which is
17:12 - a complete pivot from javascript but
17:15 - yeah well what are some things that uh
17:18 - aside from kernel development and
17:20 - hopefully getting back into free co camp
17:23 - contribution what are some areas of
17:24 - technology since you're somebody who
17:26 - is you know at many different places in
17:29 - the stack and has a pretty good
17:31 - bird's eye view on on how things are
17:33 - moving what are some things that really
17:35 - excite you about
17:37 - tech information technology and the way
17:38 - things are going
17:43 - in terms of new things um i guess
17:46 - there's a lot of scope for
17:49 - i guess
17:50 - like this is trying to unlock but the
17:51 - tight integration of
17:53 - technology and people
17:55 - i feel like there's a lot of issues that
17:57 - are
17:58 - are not serious enough that they needed
17:59 - a solution in the past
18:01 - but it becomes so easy to solve that
18:02 - they will be
18:03 - um
18:05 - a great example is the the whole health
18:07 - technology kind of revolution the way
18:09 - everyone's getting their heart rate
18:10 - constantly about and all that kind of
18:11 - stuff and there's been many cases of
18:13 - people fighting that they have asip or
18:16 - atrial fibrillation if you want the full
18:17 - global thing uh because of their smart
18:19 - watch i think there's an article really
18:20 - really about an apple watch that alerted
18:22 - a person to it um and it's stuff like
18:24 - that that can you know makes huge
18:26 - differences to lives because they're you
18:28 - know if you find that you've atrial
18:29 - fibrillation you need to get it sorted
18:30 - and it's fine
18:32 - if you sort it and if you don't you get
18:33 - yourself a lot of trouble so
18:35 - there's all kinds of applications of
18:37 - health technology in particular that are
18:39 - not only really exciting because they're
18:40 - cool but they're also really exciting
18:41 - because they're good they're doing a
18:43 - good thing in the world
18:46 - quincy it's great to talk to you live
18:48 - yeah matt uh tell us a little bit about
18:50 - uh your background
18:52 - and what you're doing
18:54 - so i'm i'm originally a music teacher i
18:56 - studied music at university
18:58 - um taught guitar on piano for several
19:01 - years
19:02 - um and then which i still do actually
19:03 - just a little bit um in the evenings and
19:05 - weekends um but i realized um
19:10 - it wasn't the career for me i wanted
19:12 - something which had a bit more direction
19:13 - had more of a challenge
19:15 - um
19:16 - and i met a friend who i'd not seen in a
19:18 - long time and
19:19 - uh he studied music with me and he was
19:21 - like oh i'm a developer now like how did
19:23 - how did that happen and uh i knew that
19:25 - well i found a lot of courses online and
19:28 - sort of taught myself and then a couple
19:29 - of years later and developed first it's
19:31 - incredible and uh so
19:33 - i started just looking around different
19:34 - resources um
19:36 - and
19:37 - this was
19:39 - so this was uh like three and a half
19:40 - years ago four years ago
19:42 - um so i was started with
19:45 - a lot of courses on coursera edx and
19:46 - those kind of things which were really
19:48 - good because they had these kind of
19:49 - deadlines so you had to get the
19:52 - project in by a certain time and then
19:54 - people peer-reviewed them
19:56 - um
19:56 - and then listened to a lot of podcasts
19:58 - and i think
20:00 - i feel it was probably javascript java
20:02 - you were on and you were talking about
20:03 - free codecamp or maybe it was code
20:05 - newbie maybe both
20:06 - and um and i heard about free code camp
20:08 - and started trying that out and and
20:11 - realized actually this is this
20:12 - incredible free platform um
20:16 - and yeah just got really into it and got
20:19 - quite disciplined about doing it every
20:21 - day
20:22 - and then uh and then i heard about these
20:24 - meetups that were going on and um which
20:27 - at first i was i'm not good enough to go
20:29 - along to these i bet everyone's amazing
20:30 - and
20:31 - you know very
20:33 - uh i was quite intimidated but i forced
20:35 - myself to go
20:36 - and then met people who were very
20:38 - similar to me you know some people who
20:39 - were above me some people who weren't
20:41 - quite where i was and
20:42 - um and found that really and suddenly it
20:45 - was oh you know maybe i can do this and
20:49 - yeah it's gone from there really
20:51 - that's awesome so
20:53 - describe the transition uh
20:56 - you're a musician
20:58 - and just
21:00 - looking at
21:01 - the different steps you would need to
21:02 - take and planning out your progression
21:04 - as
21:05 - it became clear and clear to you what
21:07 - you needed to do yeah
21:09 - i think yeah to begin with it's it's
21:10 - fine just to
21:12 - accept you're not going to learn
21:13 - everything in one go i think some people
21:14 - think they maybe do it for a week and
21:17 - think
21:18 - i feel like i don't know too much yeah
21:20 - i'm never gonna be able to do this it's
21:21 - so this just it can be overwhelming
21:23 - um it's good just to yeah just do it
21:25 - initially which i think i did
21:27 - just to try a few things out and just
21:29 - just enjoy it really not necessarily i
21:31 - mean think i need to do this and become
21:33 - a developer as soon as possible i think
21:34 - it's good to take your time just to
21:37 - yeah try try some things out and but
21:39 - then as you
21:41 - enjoy it more hopefully and get a sense
21:42 - that it is what you want to do
21:44 - trying to um
21:47 - find ways to keep yourself motivated in
21:48 - my case it was initially doing these
21:50 - courses which had deadlines at the end
21:52 - of the week
21:53 - and then in the meetups thinking okay
21:55 - there's another meetup in two weeks i'd
21:57 - like to be able to show
21:59 - something to someone by then
22:01 - you know sometimes you feel like if you
22:02 - go along and you've not done anything
22:03 - since last time it's like oh you know i
22:05 - should have done it it's a nice kind of
22:07 - motivator having some peers around you
22:10 - i think it's very easy to sort of
22:12 - stay by yourself and
22:14 - get a bit isolated but you know what we
22:16 - try and encourage with the meetups is to
22:18 - get people to come along and just
22:20 - you know
22:21 - talk to people um
22:24 - see where everyone else is don't feel
22:26 - shy about it everyone's there to help
22:28 - each other we're not about
22:30 - you know criticizing i mean it might be
22:32 - constructive criticism but um
22:35 - yeah
22:36 - thanks again matt
22:37 - knows timo is a prolific contributor i
22:39 - think i was talking about you earlier
22:41 - when we were going around in the circle
22:42 - but you've contributed an incredible
22:44 - amount and if you look on the github
22:46 - repo and look
22:47 - rank everything by commits you're way up
22:49 - there what are some
22:51 - of the ways that you've contributed to
22:52 - the free cooking community
22:54 - over the past year and a half or so
22:57 - so when it started out it was almost
22:59 - exactly two years ago now um
23:02 - i started with making small changes
23:04 - mostly to the curriculum uh small fixes
23:07 - to the test mostly so it was a test that
23:10 - was missing correct uh solutions or it
23:13 - was allowing
23:15 - solutions that shouldn't be allowed
23:17 - i try to fix those and that's mostly
23:19 - what i started out doing and then
23:21 - i found out about the freak out game
23:22 - guide being developed and actually you
23:24 - had quite a bit of time at the time that
23:26 - it uh
23:28 - was the next development and uh
23:30 - i got involved and i spent a lot of time
23:33 - on uh contributing to the freak out
23:34 - combined to the platform not the
23:36 - articles the content but to the platform
23:39 - the site around it
23:41 - yeah well thanks for all your articles
23:44 - so far sam they've been they've been
23:45 - great
23:46 - and very well received by the community
23:49 - yeah thank you virtually like the first
23:50 - article i wrote i was
23:52 - i wrote it just because i was in china
23:54 - and
23:56 - i hated the great the great firewall of
23:58 - china and i sent it to you and said can
24:00 - you have a look and you said you loved
24:02 - it and actually made me an author on the
24:05 - uh on the free code camp media mask on
24:07 - the medium publication
24:09 - and
24:10 - that just gave me the boost i needed
24:12 - every other article before that i got
24:14 - like 5 10 maybe 15 viewers
24:18 - getting on the free code camp thing
24:20 - boosted me and gave me the confidence to
24:21 - write more and that was really big for
24:23 - me
24:25 - what would be your advice to those
24:27 - people who already have kind of a
24:29 - traditional engineering training but are
24:31 - interested in pivoting into software
24:33 - development
24:34 - if you're interested in pivoting into
24:36 - software
24:37 - at all
24:38 - give it a try
24:40 - stuff like free code camp and there's
24:42 - hundreds of other free resources out
24:44 - there they're all absolutely brilliant i
24:47 - learn
24:48 - most of the stuff i know now through
24:50 - free code camp it's free it has
24:52 - step-by-step tutorials that give you
24:54 - really good feedback as you're
24:56 - progressing through
24:58 - and
24:59 - the worst that happens is you try it out
25:01 - you do two or three months
25:03 - and you find that you don't enjoy it
25:04 - that much thanks again for coming out
25:06 - man it's great great to finally meet you
25:07 - richard i'm so thrilled we've talked so
25:10 - many times we've been in touch
25:12 - richard is in charge of pre-co camp
25:15 - leads
25:16 - pre-code cam oslo
25:18 - and the free cocaine instagram which has
25:21 - i don't know 10 000 ish
25:23 - like 13 and a half or something now
25:25 - somebody dropping 13s i think yeah yeah
25:28 - and it's
25:29 - it's great photos of
25:30 - freco camp events and just beautiful
25:33 - workstations and code setups and things
25:36 - like that yeah all that stuff all the
25:37 - good stuff
25:39 - yeah what are your goals so you really
25:42 - took charge on the instagram and
25:44 - i mean you owned it
25:46 - for
25:47 - you were already very prolific on
25:49 - instagram you had a lot of your own
25:51 - photos you had a ton of followers
25:52 - yourself
25:53 - and you really took the free cocaine
25:55 - instagram which was largely just
25:57 - chilling there because
25:58 - i think i was the only person who had
26:00 - access to it at the time and and
26:02 - and now it's it's quite vibrant and
26:04 - there's a lot of beautiful photos on
26:06 - there
26:07 - can you describe that process of
26:09 - thinking like hey maybe i could help out
26:11 - with this and and how you went about it
26:14 - yes so i think um people took it from
26:17 - about three thousand at the time uh are
26:19 - you saying it was like underutilized i
26:21 - think the thing i think you were
26:23 - very um
26:26 - very very good on twitter and things
26:27 - like that that stuff was doing it um and
26:30 - what i was doing
26:32 - on my own instagram
26:34 - uh was just pictures of my code stuff
26:37 - i'm working on
26:38 - um
26:40 - and things like that so
26:42 - we had the conversation about doing some
26:44 - stuff for the free code campaign to it
26:46 - have a lot more of the community stuff
26:47 - in there as well
26:49 - trying to
26:51 - re-upload other people's pictures um
26:54 - re-gram them or whatever they call that
26:56 - um so that's kind of what we tried to do
26:58 - get the community thing more in there
27:01 - and just try and
27:03 - try and build that up and have a bit
27:04 - more of a community a bit more so other
27:06 - people could um
27:08 - you know get involved in that as well so
27:09 - that was the plan yeah
27:11 - yeah and uh early on you you made it a
27:14 - clear point that people could basically
27:15 - add mention free code camper hashtag
27:17 - freako camp on instagram and we could
27:20 - basically signal boost
27:21 - their photos and and of course credit
27:23 - them and everything uh
27:25 - are people still doing that pretty
27:27 - regularly we need them to do it more
27:29 - do it more
27:31 - especially to do with
27:33 - if there's meetups going on
27:35 - that stuff's great so if we've got a
27:37 - meet up and you've got a picture of all
27:38 - the groups and stuff like that
27:40 - we love that stuff so like send those
27:42 - stuff but um
27:43 - yeah
27:44 - i'm constantly going in there checking
27:45 - the hashtags or if you've been tagging
27:47 - us in them directly as well trying to
27:49 - find the good stuff out there and
27:50 - posting it on there so um
27:53 - if if people send me the good stuff then
27:55 - it means i don't have to do anything so
27:57 - that's kind of what we want to do for
27:59 - sure
28:00 - for everything you're doing richard
28:02 - andera has contributed extensively to
28:05 - free code camp uh through the free co
28:07 - camp guide and also publishing articles
28:10 - on medium tell us a little bit about
28:11 - yourself and how you discovered free
28:14 - code camp and decided to contribute to
28:15 - it
28:16 - okay um at the moment i'm a student
28:19 - actually just started like last week
28:21 - university um the
28:23 - my journey with frequent camp started
28:25 - when i um moved from like g sharp to
28:28 - javascript because i needed to learn
28:30 - node.js for like a server application
28:34 - and uh i basically discovered frequent
28:36 - camp to learn javascript then
28:39 - i started like reading the articles on
28:41 - the medium publication
28:43 - and when i decided that i wanted to also
28:47 - write articles it just felt natural to
28:50 - go
28:51 - to publish the articles on the media
28:53 - publication
28:54 - and then from there like the involvement
28:57 - with the community just like grew uh
29:00 - gradually yeah how old are you
29:02 - 18.
29:03 - oh wow
29:04 - you're getting really into
29:06 - uh really deep into technology pretty
29:07 - young and that's that's excellent
29:10 - yeah i actually like started my first
29:14 - experiences with coding like at 12. um
29:18 - the story goes basically oh i like games
29:22 - why not make one and then like i just
29:24 - started with the software that lets you
29:28 - just create the game with drag and drop
29:30 - stuff
29:31 - and then you say oh i want to add this
29:34 - like cool feature i will learn some
29:36 - scripting and then oh
29:38 - program is super cool i will learn this
29:40 - all right cheers all right
29:42 - i'll just grab the camera
29:45 - um
29:47 - so
29:47 - matt's over here we're gonna take a big
29:49 - group photo and then we're gonna
29:50 - gracefully leave
29:52 - [Music]
29:54 - thank you so much for tuning in for the
29:56 - stream we got to talk to a lot of
29:58 - exciting people doing exciting work both
30:01 - within the free cocaine community and
30:03 - just working as developers
30:05 - so i hope you all have a beautiful
30:07 - evening
