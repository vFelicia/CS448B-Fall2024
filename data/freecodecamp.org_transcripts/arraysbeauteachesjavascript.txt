00:00 - with javascript array variables we can
00:03 - store several pieces of data in one
00:04 - place
00:05 - you can start an array declaration with
00:07 - an open square bracket and end it with a
00:10 - closing square bracket and then you put
00:12 - a comma between each entry
00:16 - so you start an array declaration with
00:18 - an open square bracket and you end it
00:20 - with a closed square bracket and then
00:22 - you put a comma between each entry so
00:25 - these are all strings but you can also
00:28 - store numbers you can store objects you
00:30 - can store booleans and any data type you
00:33 - can store in an array you can also
00:36 - nest arrays within other arrays so one
00:39 - of the things you can store in an array
00:41 - is another array these are called
00:43 - multi-dimensional arrays here's an
00:45 - example of that
00:50 - so
00:51 - inside this first array there's two
00:53 - other arrays so this is the first item
00:56 - in the first array which is an array and
00:58 - this is the second item in the array
01:00 - which is another array and inside those
01:02 - arrays there are two items there's a
01:04 - string and a number an array can have
01:06 - multiple different types of data types
01:09 - in the array you can access elements of
01:12 - arrays using indexes
01:15 - if i use these brackets after the name
01:17 - of the array then i put the index of the
01:20 - element in the array now indexes start
01:22 - at zero so peanut butter is zero jelly
01:25 - is one and bread is two
01:28 - let's run that
01:30 - and we can see jelly in the console here
01:33 - you can also change array elements using
01:36 - indexes
01:41 - okay i actually like peanut butter and
01:43 - banana sandwiches better than peanut
01:45 - butter and jelly sandwiches so i have
01:47 - access array index one which is jelly
01:51 - and i set that equal to bananas and then
01:54 - you can see i log the sandwich array and
01:57 - over on the console we have peanut
01:59 - butter bananas and bread you can also
02:01 - access elements of multi-dimensional
02:03 - arrays with indexes you can change the
02:05 - elements too
02:06 - let me show you how you do that
02:10 - so you have to use two set of sets of
02:13 - brackets
02:14 - the first set of brackets refers to the
02:16 - entry in the outermost or the first
02:18 - level of the array and each additional
02:20 - pair of brackets refers to the next
02:22 - level of entries inside so index one is
02:25 - going to be here this is zero right here
02:27 - and this is one
02:29 - and then the next index is index zero so
02:32 - within this array right here we have
02:35 - index zero index one so that's going to
02:39 - console.log white socks
02:41 - and there we go at the end white sox you
02:43 - can also change the elements just like
02:45 - that
02:46 - so if i take the same thing here
02:49 - i'm going to put
02:51 - red sox
02:53 - and then we're going to console.log
02:55 - teams
02:57 - and you can see the array is now balls
03:00 - 23 red sox 45 instead of the white sox
03:03 - one of the methods that all arrays have
03:06 - is for each
03:08 - let me show you how that works
03:10 - so here is the array with a for each
03:13 - method on it so we have sandwich dot
03:16 - four each that means for each element in
03:20 - the sandwich array we're going to do
03:21 - something and you have to pass in a
03:23 - function to show what you're going to do
03:24 - with each element so in the function
03:27 - whatever you put inside these
03:29 - parentheses here are is that each
03:31 - element of the array so we're going to
03:33 - pass in each element of the array into
03:35 - this function and we're going to console
03:37 - that log the element so we're just going
03:38 - to print each item in the array so if i
03:40 - run that
03:43 - see at the end you can see on each line
03:44 - there's peanut butter bananas bread
03:47 - now you can do a lot more complicated
03:49 - things this allows you to just do
03:50 - something with each element of an array
03:53 - check out my common array methods video
03:55 - to learn more about array methods well
03:58 - that's the basics of arrays thanks for
