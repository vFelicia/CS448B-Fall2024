00:00 - this week I'm building the leaderboard
00:02 - project so last week I designed it and
00:04 - this week I'm trying to implement it
00:06 - [Music]
00:35 - so I will start the project with the
00:36 - layout and uh later I will move the
00:39 - components um to to react components it
00:43 - shouldn't take much longer because uh it
00:45 - will be like um copy paste later to
00:48 - react components
00:52 - [Music]
01:30 - a

03:17 - [Music]
03:59 - it's Friday in the evening this is how
04:01 - the app looks right now uh I would say
04:04 - it's ready and uh ready to go uh when it
04:08 - comes for the
04:09 - iteration the default tab is last 40
04:12 - days and the user can change the tab to
04:14 - all times where the total amount of
04:17 - points is the
04:19 - priority the list needs a moment to load
04:21 - that's why I introduced the intro screen
04:23 - here with loading deleters
04:28 - Graphics the app is built with uh
04:31 - bootstrap partially with flex box and of
04:35 - course with react and SAS according to
04:37 - the
04:38 - requirements I introduced a few changes
04:41 - regarding the previous design they were
04:44 - usually about the position where
04:47 - something stored or about the font sizes
04:50 - and for example here this fre code comp
04:53 - leaders headline is much bigger than in
04:56 - the uh in the designs and all
05:00 - also when we talk about wider screens uh
05:05 - in order to keep the visual hierarchy
05:07 - better uh I also um made the badges and
05:12 - uh the username
05:15 - bigger the app is accessible from the
05:18 - keyboard and you can access each um fre
05:23 - code Camp leader from here and go to the
05:27 - fre Cod Camp um profile the previous
05:30 - apps that I did revie JS were either
05:33 - bigger like GitHub bottle that was done
05:36 - with web pack or
05:38 - smaller as a result uh here I had to
05:41 - stop around and were think how to do it
05:44 - how to implement it what to start with
05:46 - do I really need web pack and things
05:49 - like that it was really problematic
05:51 - because for a moment I didn't know what
05:53 - to do and then I started copying uh and
05:57 - pasting from the previous apps uh and
06:00 - doing it step by step checking if what I
06:02 - cop it works and did
06:07 - um so that's how I uh that that's why I
06:11 - defeated this problem this was really a
06:13 - problematic moment this week because I
06:14 - didn't know what to do for a moment and
06:17 - your motivation falls down but when it
06:20 - started working it dries up again next
06:23 - week I'm going to start the new up it
06:25 - will be the recipe box it is quite a big
06:28 - up so probably it will take me longer
06:32 - than a week to do it uh if I want to
06:35 - really polish it um but I will started
06:39 - this week I also found very interesting
06:41 - uh resource about uh JavaScript about
06:44 - vanilla JavaScript I will share it also
06:46 - in the video description below it's the
06:49 - series called JavaScript 30 uh which is
06:52 - about 30 tasks uh and 30 solutions to
06:54 - these tasks um and this is the challenge
06:57 - to build 30 new products project with
07:00 - vanilla JavaScript all of them should be
07:03 - built with vanilla JavaScript so no
07:06 - Frameworks and you have to deal with
07:08 - them on your own just only with JS
07:12 - that's why it can be pretty challenging
07:14 - and pretty fun and I will really have to
07:16 - find time to look into
07:19 - [Music]
07:22 - it so the project is done you can see it
07:26 - at the one who does SL leaderboard I
07:29 - will will put the link in the video
07:30 - description below keep on doing and see
07:33 - you next week
