00:00 - this week i'm working on the top layer
00:01 - of logic in the recipe box
00:10 - [Music]
00:42 - i started with routine in order to do it
00:44 - i installed react router and history
00:48 - later i imported
00:50 - router route index route and hash
00:53 - history
00:54 - appropriately to the files next i named
00:56 - the path and the components and that
00:59 - will be
01:00 - loaded in a given path
01:02 - the index route in my case is home page
01:06 - so component called home
01:08 - the next step this week was learning
01:10 - more about local storage i used it a few
01:14 - times for example in pomodoro clock but
01:16 - i had to come back to
01:19 - json stringify or jason pars because i
01:22 - didn't remember that
01:24 - [Music]
01:31 - [Music]
01:43 - the next step is uh the most tricky for
01:45 - me because it's the top level logic so
01:48 - the logic on the level of pages and
01:50 - connecting everything with local storage
01:53 - i want to start it with the free
01:55 - functions so
01:57 - saving the recipe to data storage
02:00 - loading a given recipe from data storage
02:03 - and
02:04 - retrieving all recipes getting all the
02:06 - recipes from data storage let's get back
02:08 - to work
02:10 - [Music]
02:17 - [Music]
02:49 - foreign
02:55 - [Music]
03:04 - [Music]
03:37 - so
03:42 - [Music]
03:52 - this week was difficult the project is
03:54 - quite hard because
03:58 - it's got a lot of components and i added
04:00 - also extra functionality but i don't
04:02 - manage however there are the moments
04:05 - where you are fed up that something
04:07 - doesn't go as you want and you have to
04:10 - consult it many times online check the
04:13 - stuff and
04:15 - stack overflow
04:16 - back free code
04:20 - asking questions to the stack overflow
04:23 - that really solve your problems
04:28 - knowing a lot
04:35 - learning fast
04:45 - but life
04:46 - isn't so easy
04:48 - and said that it's hard you develop so
04:51 - if it's too easy
04:52 - you don't develop that's why i think
04:55 - that it's all worth doing but
04:58 - but sometimes it's
05:00 - annoying that
05:02 - you don't know that something doesn't
05:05 - work again and you even don't get what's
05:08 - written in stack overflow
05:11 - [Music]
05:14 - life
05:17 - [Music]
05:43 - me
05:46 - [Music]
05:56 - [Music]
05:58 - this week in malaga snow and
06:01 - for malaga area this is a kind of money
06:03 - when it snows in spain in andalusia so
06:06 - in the south of spain it's really a
06:08 - problem because there's no central
06:10 - heating in the houses and floods and
06:12 - generally you have just some air
06:14 - conditioning or extra radiators that you
06:17 - have to buy
06:18 - fortunately i have air conditioning nice
06:21 - blanket
06:22 - and
06:23 - we bought some a theater however snow in
06:26 - malaga is something rare it wasn't
06:28 - snowing here for decades climate changes
06:32 - are real and
06:34 - global warming doesn't mean that it
06:37 - should be really hotter technology
06:39 - without clear thinking and global
06:41 - sustainable solutions wouldn't save the
06:43 - world
06:44 - [Music]
06:47 - it's the end of the week this is how it
06:49 - looks now this is the home page and
06:52 - with react i'm right now going to
06:56 - create a recipe view
06:59 - so on create page i can add
07:03 - [Music]
07:07 - tags
07:08 - [Music]
07:14 - i can add a photo and create right now
07:21 - ingredients
07:26 - [Music]
07:32 - instructions
07:37 - and i can save the recipe
07:41 - when the recipe is saved
07:46 - it's already in the local storage
07:49 - with the name
07:51 - tags
07:53 - image
07:54 - [Music]
07:56 - instructions and ingredients
07:59 - in code it looks like that
08:01 - [Music]
08:03 - so
08:04 - i
08:05 - created additional file
08:08 - logic.js
08:11 - in which i get at these
08:13 - free functions save recipe
08:15 - low recipe and recipe list
08:20 - which i use later in addition
08:24 - importing the function that i need
08:26 - from logic ds
08:28 - [Music]
08:30 - and
08:31 - i created
08:33 - the constructor
08:35 - uh
08:36 - and in the state i got an object with
08:38 - the key of name tags image ingredients
08:41 - and instructions i added the methods on
08:44 - title change
08:46 - on text change
08:48 - on image change and ingredients and an
08:50 - instruction change where where i catch
08:53 - the changes and save them
08:56 - to local storage
08:58 - it says that i introduced routine and
09:00 - thanks to this routine i can come from
09:03 - one page the other
09:04 - [Music]
09:06 - so
09:07 - for example
09:09 - this
09:11 - add button here goes to
09:14 - adding the recipe in home js
09:18 - i have
09:19 - used link
09:21 - that's the redirecting to edition
09:24 - and
09:25 - in main.js
09:28 - i added paths
09:30 - that is index route addition and details
09:34 - when i go to edition i go to edition.js
09:37 - and i'm here so
09:39 - i can
09:40 - see the addition mode
09:42 - which means that i'm here
09:44 - and this is the example how i connected
09:46 - everything with routine
09:48 - next week i will continue with the rest
09:50 - of the app because still it needs much
09:52 - much more wag keep on doing remember
09:55 - that we have one planet and one life
09:57 - see you next week
10:07 - you
