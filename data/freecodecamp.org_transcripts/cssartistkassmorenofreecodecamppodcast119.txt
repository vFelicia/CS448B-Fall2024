02:29 - right and here we are on CSS artist.com
02:33 - and can yeah go ahead and talk talk us
02:37 - through what you're doing okay yeah so
02:40 - this is my portfolio website I wanted to
02:43 - make sure that it was a little bit weird
02:44 - a little bit um different uh so I have
02:49 - most of my CSS art on here but the one
02:51 - that I'm like most proud of I think is
02:53 - super cool is the um I made the
02:55 - scrolling animation for the uh photo
02:58 - realistic Polaroid drawing that I made
03:01 - using CSS and HTML so it's basically as
03:05 - you scroll you see how the um how the
03:08 - drawing is getting built so you see like
03:11 - the two boxes then you you know more
03:14 - like shading comes in you see
03:16 - Flash the um the lens so you kind of get
03:21 - to see the progression of it uh that's
03:23 - probably my favorite CSS art ever yeah
03:27 - and it's so cool if you scroll down just
03:28 - so we can see the finished product like
03:30 - the the actual like gloss to it the
03:33 - sheen I mean it looks so delicious for
03:36 - lack of a better word it looks like uh
03:38 - almost like a cake matte finish like
03:41 - that that shininess and then of course
03:43 - the iconic Polaroid slot where you pull
03:45 - your your photo out after you've taken
03:48 - the photo everything looks so photo
03:50 - realistic like the uh the glare on the
03:53 - lens for example the the the glass that
03:56 - covers like that aperture that takes the
03:58 - photo yeah yeah everything and the
04:00 - viewfinder I mean so photo realistic and
04:04 - so cool I love it thank you yeah yeah
04:07 - the um it's those little details that
04:10 - you have to spend so much time looking
04:12 - at and they seem so insignificant at
04:15 - first until you like take a step back
04:16 - and look at the whole thing you're like
04:18 - okay no that was definitely worth it to
04:19 - do yeah yeah let's take a look at some
04:22 - of your other work too so if you scroll
04:24 - down on her page you just get like this
04:28 - amazing grid of
04:30 - photorealistic CSS uh art like uh for
04:35 - example maybe we could click on uh that
04:38 - crayon
04:39 - box uh yeah this is one of the first
04:42 - ones that I did and I believe if I'm not
04:44 - mistaken it's a single div wow so the
04:47 - HTML is just
04:49 - div and everything inside is just
04:52 - backgrounds is it like absolutely
04:54 - positioned or like how how do you do
04:56 - that yeah this one's just absolutely
04:58 - positioned with a sing background and uh
05:02 - it's just Stacks linear
05:04 - gradients yeah and it looks like a photo
05:07 - realistic Crayola box without the
05:08 - Crayola logo it's got that those iconic
05:11 - kind of green and yellow box and like
05:14 - the shadow underneath it and like the
05:17 - the some of the colors have like this
05:19 - matte finish to them to them some are a
05:21 - little bit shiny so
05:23 - beautiful yeah thank you yeah this one
05:25 - was I think one of the first ones that I
05:27 - that I really did as soon as you learn
05:29 - how to stack the gradients with the
05:30 - single div like you're Off to the Races
05:33 - yeah let's take a look at that
05:35 - calculator okay yeah this one was
05:38 - probably the hardest one I've ever done
05:40 - easily probably yeah yeah yeah the
05:43 - buttons the buttons oh my gosh those
05:45 - took
05:46 - forever yeah they just have this
05:49 - concaveness like this concavity whatever
05:51 - the word is like you can almost feel
05:53 - like your fingertip kind of like resting
05:56 - on top of it and like the ergonomic of
05:58 - it and then just pressing it in and
06:00 - feeling that that tactile click uh you
06:03 - can imagine like you're just working
06:04 - really fast like kind of a tanky type
06:06 - thing so cool and it it's got kind of
06:09 - that iconic like orange and gray look uh
06:12 - orange and gray I don't know what it is
06:13 - about them like the NES zapper gun like
06:16 - has that like at least in the US it had
06:18 - that orange and gray look so cool
06:20 - looking yeah like nostalgic oh yeah that
06:24 - off white casing that they used to
06:26 - always put Electronics on in yeah yeah
06:29 - so cool and there's a ton of CSS here
06:31 - how many lines of CSS is this this one
06:34 - is oh it's still loading
06:39 - 1,143
06:41 - lines yeah so it's a lot and it it was
06:45 - the buttons the buttons they look like
06:46 - you could just copy and paste them but
06:49 - they each need to have their own
06:50 - separate like kind of shading and
06:53 - gradience on it um otherwise it just it
06:56 - just didn't look it just didn't look
06:58 - right so yeah that's took forever and
07:00 - that's pretty much what all of the CSS
07:02 - is I mean like that attention to detail
07:04 - thinking like even though this button is
07:06 - only like you know 5 mm to the right of
07:09 - this one it's going to be hit by the
07:11 - Light slightly differently right like
07:13 - the Shadows look slight long yeah yeah
07:17 - yeah so if you look from the buttons
07:18 - like they're just slightly different not
07:21 - too different just slightly
07:23 - different amazing and that game boy
07:26 - let's check out that that that game game
07:28 - boy so nice this is like one of the
07:30 - second generation game boys I think cuz
07:33 - it's like a little bit less boxy yeah
07:36 - yeah yeah this one um oh my gosh I loved
07:39 - Game Boy I used to play like Pokemon all
07:41 - the time on especially like on trips and
07:43 - stuff so this one was super fun to do I
07:46 - loved doing the shading inside of the
07:47 - screen so it looks like it's kind of
07:49 - inset how the game boys actually
07:51 - look I don't know why I thought that was
07:53 - so cool looking and the shading on the
07:56 - on the arrows and the buttons love that
07:58 - too yeah it's super fun to do amazing
08:02 - again anybody listening to the audio
08:03 - version CSS artist.com you can check all
08:06 - these out um these are so cool all right
08:10 - well let's talk about the woman behind
08:13 - the art C Mareno like let's dive
08:17 - into how you got to this level with your
08:21 - CSS skills and uh maybe what I like to
08:25 - do is I like to start at the very
08:26 - beginning as far back as we can go maybe
08:29 - you could talk a little bit about your
08:31 - early days um and um I understand that
08:35 - you were born in Mexico and that you
08:37 - moved to the us when you were six yeah
08:39 - yeah well I was actually I'm I was born
08:41 - in the US uh but I lived in Mexico um
08:46 - until I was six and then I moved back to
08:48 - the US to San Antonio Texas because my
08:52 - parents started a business so um from
08:54 - there you know English became my main
08:57 - language and uh yeah so I ended up just
09:00 - growing up here uh went to high school I
09:03 - was not a great high school student um
09:07 - skipped a lot all of that good stuff all
09:09 - of the fun stuff but uh at the end I
09:13 - decided that I wanted to go to school
09:15 - for architecture yes so um yeah I did
09:19 - that for three whole years and it was so
09:22 - intense like I remember the first day in
09:24 - class like they sit you down in studio
09:26 - and you get there and you're like you
09:28 - know super excited to be here and the
09:29 - teacher like I hope you don't have a
09:31 - boyfriend and I hope you don't have
09:32 - another job because this is going to be
09:34 - your life from now on and I'm just like
09:36 - oh my gosh what did I do yeah yeah so I
09:42 - did that for three years until I was
09:44 - like the thought it it was fun it was uh
09:48 - it taught me a lot like um that's that
09:50 - school was a lot it was uh wow sorry it
09:55 - really pushed a lot of like Hands-On
09:57 - work instead of computer work for
09:59 - architecture so like at the beginning we
10:01 - did a lot of like art projects um
10:04 - learning like art Theory and all of that
10:06 - photorealistic drawings and stuff which
10:08 - I love but the thought of having to do
10:11 - that and like doing architecture for the
10:12 - rest of my life was uh it just it didn't
10:15 - sound like something I want to do so
10:18 - yeah it's a it's a difficult decision
10:20 - but year three almost done I decided
10:23 - that this was not for me like at all I
10:25 - couldn't wasn't like like can you
10:29 - remember what that that moment of you
10:32 - know Revelation maybe it wasn't maybe it
10:33 - was a gradual sinking feeling but like
10:36 - when you finally decided no I'm really
10:38 - not going to do this I'm not going to
10:39 - spend my life being an architect uh like
10:43 - what did you do at that point uh yeah it
10:46 - was it was gradual you like you start
10:48 - getting less excited to go to class you
10:50 - start getting less excited to learn like
10:52 - you don't really want to do the projects
10:53 - anymore and you know it's uh it finally
10:58 - just kind of clicks one day that like my
10:59 - grades were falling it was it was
11:01 - showing everywhere that I just didn't
11:03 - want to do that anymore so I finally was
11:05 - just like okay no like I need to Pivot
11:08 - it's probably not the best idea I may be
11:12 - making the wrong choice but I feel it
11:13 - like in my heart that like this isn't
11:15 - what I'm going to do forever is going to
11:18 - make me happy you make that decision
11:20 - what do you
11:21 - do call my mom all right call my mom and
11:26 - tell her uh and you know try to be real
11:29 - nice about it because she's paying for
11:31 - school and everything and um thankfully
11:34 - she's very kind and she said you know
11:36 - that's fine you have to do something
11:38 - though so like figure something out get
11:40 - a job at least like we'll go from there
11:43 - so yeah thankfully like my mom was super
11:46 - cool about it and she let me just
11:48 - like no harm no foul like it happens you
11:52 - know just be happy so I I did I ended up
11:55 - getting a job at Sprint I didn't know
11:57 - what I was going to do so I just started
12:00 - working which is where I also found out
12:02 - I really didn't want to be a salesperson
12:04 - yeah Sprint is for for anybody outside
12:07 - the US Sprint is a like cell phone
12:10 - carrier uh it's like one of the big they
12:13 - were did they they were they got bought
12:15 - by T-Mobile oh okay yeah so yeah you
12:18 - used to like was were there the ones
12:20 - with like so quiet like you can hear a
12:22 - pin drop was that their commercial uh no
12:24 - I think I'm not sure actually but there
12:27 - was like there were like some really
12:28 - interesting like 1980s 1990s nothing was
12:31 - more 80s than you know cell phone
12:34 - carrier commercial or 90s I guess
12:35 - because cell phones were pretty can you
12:36 - hear me in the 90s yeah exactly yeah
12:39 - they had like the big can you hear me
12:40 - now I'm walking around like the entire
12:42 - us to check the coverage yeah uh so so
12:46 - you were you decided you didn't want to
12:48 - do sales like but you spent like two
12:49 - years working in it yeah yeah um but it
12:53 - was I was not good at it I was probably
12:55 - the worst sales person I don't it's
12:58 - really hard for me to try to tell
12:59 - someone that they need this like $40
13:01 - charger when you don't really need the
13:02 - $40 charger let's be real so no I'm not
13:06 - a sales person at all never put me in
13:08 - any sales position because I'm just
13:11 - going to agree with the customer on
13:13 - everything and be like n you don't
13:14 - really need it yeah wow you're you're
13:16 - too empathetic you're too nice to be a
13:18 - salesperson maybe yes that's that's
13:20 - that's my problem I'm too nice
13:24 - so you know we jump straight to college
13:26 - but I I do want to talk a little bit
13:28 - about uh your early days because you you
13:30 - said you were born in San
13:32 - Antonio uh I was born in Laredo Laredo
13:35 - okay that's here in Texas too sorry I'm
13:37 - like not a native yeah that's Texas so
13:41 - it was kind of funny because I was born
13:42 - in Laro but I lived in noo which is
13:45 - Mexico and um so I would actually I went
13:50 - to school in the US too though so I
13:52 - would like drive across the border every
13:55 - day for elementary for like Kinder in
13:57 - elementary school
13:59 - um so that was
14:02 - interesting uh but yeah I did that until
14:04 - I was six and then we moved to the US
14:06 - okay yeah so you already had some
14:08 - English skills and
14:11 - uh you you told me earlier before we
14:13 - started recording like your sister was
14:15 - really big on English and and she was an
14:18 - inspiration for you to really like bulk
14:19 - up on your English skills yeah yeah well
14:22 - because actually most of the people in
14:24 - my school just spoke Spanish even though
14:25 - it's in the US it was predominantly just
14:28 - Spanish and Mexican people so um we
14:31 - didn't really speak any English but my
14:33 - sister was learning it and I remember
14:35 - she was like kind of talking it with her
14:37 - friends and everything and I'm like you
14:39 - know I want to talk that like I want to
14:41 - speak English too like what and so
14:44 - that's what got me to learn just being
14:46 - like that annoying little sister of like
14:48 - I want to do what you're
14:50 - doing yeah so obviously that worked out
14:55 - really well for you because I mean you
14:56 - sound like a native speaker of of course
14:58 - starting early what about the rest of
15:00 - you uh like uh and so you have an older
15:04 - sister and you have a brother as well
15:06 - yeah yeah I have an older sister I have
15:08 - a younger brother so I'm the middle
15:10 - child and then I have two half sisters
15:13 - um they're both in college right now
15:15 - okay cool
15:17 - and what did your brother and sister
15:20 - like ultimately decide to do I'm just
15:21 - curious what we're talking about them
15:23 - like uh yeah are they they are they here
15:28 - in Texas still yeah yeah so my brother
15:31 - went to UT um then back home yeah
15:36 - University of Texas um he studied
15:39 - business there and so now he's working
15:41 - in my parents' business and so is my
15:43 - sister so it's like a whole family
15:45 - business and they're all working except
15:46 - for me okay cool and yeah so so I'm
15:51 - really excited to talk about your
15:53 - relationship with your mom I know that
15:54 - sounds weird to say but like she my
15:57 - understanding is she was absolutely
15:59 - vital to helping you like launch your uh
16:04 - career as a software developer yeah you
16:07 - could talk about like how that came
16:09 - about yeah so I mean one thing to know
16:12 - my mom is a saint okay like uh she let
16:15 - me kind of flail around and try to
16:17 - figure out what I want to do with my
16:18 - life which is not something that a lot
16:20 - of people get a chance to do like they
16:22 - don't you know she's she's very patient
16:24 - with me um but yeah it was towards the
16:28 - end of my
16:29 - my non-successful tenure at Sprint that
16:33 - she was like hey I need a website for
16:35 - the business I need a new one because
16:37 - theirs was super old she's like you're
16:39 - not doing anything right so like why
16:41 - don't you try to figure this out and she
16:44 - was right I wasn't so I'm like okay yeah
16:46 - that actually sounds like something fun
16:48 - like something I could just dive into
16:50 - and um from there yeah I started reading
16:54 - about WordPress cuz that's what her site
16:56 - was on and then I started like okay so
16:58 - then I need theme okay what's the most
17:00 - popular theme cool so how do I change
17:02 - this header like and then it just
17:04 - snowballed into like oh okay so I should
17:07 - probably like look at this course and
17:08 - then like oh free code camp and then
17:10 - like oh you D me and it just never ended
17:13 - and yeah it was just quite the quite the
17:16 - beginning right it just snowballs once
17:18 - you start you just keep getting more
17:19 - curious about everything
17:21 - else yeah and maybe you can talk about
17:24 - like that process of building that
17:26 - project WordPress of course being this
17:28 - giant ecosystem of plugins and templates
17:31 - and things like that like how did you
17:33 - start out what was the what was the
17:34 - first uh because this is really cool
17:37 - it's like project oriented learning you
17:38 - already have a stakeholder right your
17:41 - mom and yeah of course nobody wants to
17:43 - disappoint their mom so you're probably
17:45 - working really hard to get this done
17:47 - well yeah yeah after dropping out of
17:49 - college and leaving Sprint I definitely
17:51 - needed this to be like a thing that
17:53 - she's like oh thank you like you know I
17:55 - wanted to help her at this point because
17:57 - she's helped me so much so yeah I spent
18:00 - a lot of time on this trying to make
18:01 - sure it's perfect like I found the you
18:04 - know the perfect theme and then I joined
18:07 - the theme groups but that wasn't enough
18:09 - because like what if I want to change
18:11 - something very specifically and like
18:13 - look at all of these other cool sites I
18:14 - want to do what they do like so um I
18:18 - started taking CSS courses and then I'm
18:20 - like oh but if I want to do this you
18:22 - need to learn JavaScript what's that oh
18:24 - my gosh that looks really difficult um
18:27 - and so yeah you just kind of start with
18:29 - that
18:30 - and so the process was just yeah
18:33 - iterations and iterations of just
18:34 - getting better and like I'd be I
18:37 - remember just being at home at night
18:38 - next to my well now husband and just
18:40 - being like look babe I I changed the
18:42 - header to this website like the color
18:44 - was black and now it's red like I was so
18:47 - excited and he was like there just like
18:48 - yeah that's so cool and so then I would
18:50 - show my mom like and so yeah it's we
18:53 - just kept iterating where I would like
18:54 - you know compare their websites see what
18:56 - they do like what is my mom trying to do
18:58 - like it just it was a lot of learning
19:00 - like like you said project oriented
19:02 - learning is incredible because you
19:04 - already you're not like lost you you
19:06 - have like a clear set of things that you
19:08 - need to get done and you just kind of
19:10 - you just jump right in yeah and so you
19:14 - eventually build this this website for
19:17 - your mom is is it still live today is it
19:19 - is it a WordPress no no yeah that was a
19:22 - while ago they already took that one
19:23 - down okay but I mean nothing lasts
19:26 - forever in on on the web as Mark Mark
19:30 - Zuckerberg says like you know when uh
19:34 - you know you can find like ancient ruins
19:36 - of like past civilizations but on the
19:38 - web nothing is left it's just like yeah
19:41 - it's as though nothing were even there
19:43 - sorry it's kind of like a menacing Mark
19:45 - Zuckerberg no no that's true though like
19:47 - even like trying to show clients past
19:49 - work is like uh I can't really show this
19:52 - to you because it's not live anymore but
19:54 - I promise it was cool yeah exactly uh
19:57 - maybe some maybe it's on the internet
19:58 - archive somewhere so um so you build
20:02 - this site and like what happens next
20:04 - like does that kind of like does that
20:07 - serve as a a win that like helps push
20:11 - you to continue learn the win that I
20:13 - needed the the win that I really really
20:15 - needed because I didn't know how bad it
20:17 - like I was I didn't realize how bad I
20:20 - was feeling about myself cuz I'm like no
20:21 - architecture no sales like what am I
20:23 - doing everyone around me was you know
20:26 - all my friends were doing really really
20:28 - great things and I'm just sitting here
20:30 - so that was my way yeah and you're like
20:32 - 28 years old at this point approximately
20:34 - right yeah yeah so so just to put that
20:36 - in perspective like you probably have
20:38 - lots of friends who went to architecture
20:40 - school who are now working at like big
20:43 - contractors or developers or something
20:45 - like right like so a lot of your peer
20:47 - group is like Way Beyond where you were
20:50 - at that time and I hope that doesn't
20:52 - sound insensitive for me to say that
20:54 - because I was not at all like to some
20:56 - extent learning the code at age 31 right
20:58 - so but here you are in a completely
21:01 - different field like getting things done
21:04 - and and this this has to be like a huge
21:08 - win in terms of like motivation and like
21:11 - self-perception like I can actually get
21:13 - things done right yeah yeah it was I
21:15 - remember the feeling it was one of the
21:16 - first times in a long time that I felt
21:18 - like I wanted to do something and I
21:20 - actually did it like and it was hard and
21:23 - I didn't know how to do it at first but
21:24 - I did it like it it really motivates you
21:26 - to be like anything that comes your way
21:29 - now like I could probably figure it out
21:32 - if I could figure that out from
21:34 - nothing yeah so what do you do
21:37 - next okay so next um she so that was
21:40 - like her actual like front end part of
21:42 - the website um she needed something that
21:45 - kept like inventory and stuff and like
21:49 - you had to it's been a while but you had
21:52 - to you know upload prices somewhere and
21:55 - then like view the prices so like
21:56 - basically just like a a rest op so I
21:59 - went and I started learning like full
22:02 - stack
22:04 - um that was interesting and fun it was
22:07 - It was kind of it was doing that by
22:09 - yourself and being like an introvert is
22:11 - really hard because I don't want like I
22:13 - didn't want to reach out to anyone I
22:14 - didn't want to ask anyone any questions
22:16 - like I don't know any web developers
22:17 - like what so I just I really for the
22:21 - longest time I just kind of kept to
22:22 - myself I remember one problem took me
22:24 - like a week to figure out cuz I refused
22:26 - to like ask anyone or like I think I
22:28 - asked something on stack Overflow once
22:30 - and I got downvoted immediately so like
22:33 - just crazy so I'm like okay I'm not
22:35 - doing that anymore so um yeah I I I
22:38 - created this this little app that it's
22:41 - it's super simple but it allows them to
22:43 - upload some pricing and then like view
22:45 - the pricing later and then add their
22:47 - products and whatnot so that is not up
22:50 - anymore either but it was a great
22:51 - learning experience and um my mom was
22:54 - actually proud of me yeah well even
22:57 - though your mom was pretty proud of you
22:59 - like I know I know you've had to uh
23:01 - endure a lot of financial hardship uh
23:03 - during this process cuz I mean you're
23:05 - like a university drop out uh you you
23:08 - left your job at Sprint and you know
23:11 - maybe your mom was compensating you in
23:12 - any way in some way but like what were
23:14 - you doing were you like living with your
23:15 - family at this point or how were you
23:17 - getting by um yeah so I was just living
23:20 - with my boyfriend and I was not really
23:22 - getting by too well cuz I didn't
23:24 - actually have a job I was just helping
23:25 - my mom with this but she wasn't really
23:27 - paying me too much she was just helping
23:29 - me here and there but it wasn't like an
23:32 - actual job that paid you a lot like I I
23:35 - think I was you know she'd give me like
23:37 - $300 a week or something which again
23:39 - added to my feeling of just like what am
23:41 - I doing here like what is going on um
23:45 - yeah I was so broke living with my
23:48 - boyfriend like he had a part-time job I
23:49 - just I felt almost lost but like really
23:52 - excited too just like maybe I could
23:54 - learn to do this maybe I can actually
23:56 - like become a developer but yeah it was
23:59 - it was very difficult for a while um I
24:01 - remember my car my car was so old at the
24:04 - time like and Rusty um I woke up one day
24:09 - I went outside to my car and I had a
24:10 - ticket because they said it was like no
24:13 - abandoned cars on the street and it
24:16 - wasn't abandoned it just looked old cuz
24:18 - I just didn't have any money to get
24:20 - another one but like oh my gosh like
24:22 - that was the moment where I was just
24:23 - like freaked out I was like I can't even
24:25 - pay a $40 ticket cuz my car looks old
24:28 - what am I doing so that was like I don't
24:32 - even want to say low point because it
24:33 - wasn't cuz I was also really excited
24:35 - about like web dead but I was pretty low
24:39 - like something needs to happen like
24:41 - right now I need to figure something out
24:43 - yeah this is not sustainable like and I
24:46 - need a new car cuz the AC in mine did
24:49 - not work and Texas is not forgiving when
24:51 - it comes to that summer yeah so
24:56 - um what did you do like like did did
24:59 - your financial hardship kind of like
25:01 - apply additional pressure did it help
25:02 - you kind of get over some of your
25:04 - introversion start asking people for
25:06 - help how did you meet other developers
25:08 - what did you do from there okay yeah so
25:10 - that definitely not even that helped me
25:12 - get over my intro version like I was
25:14 - still dead set on I am not contacting
25:17 - anyone which for anyone listening by the
25:19 - way just reach out like it's so much
25:20 - easier and I love it when people reach
25:22 - out and I love talking to people and I
25:24 - love having conversations with
25:25 - developers that have questions like I
25:27 - don't know why I didn't didn't do it
25:29 - just do it um but yeah that definitely
25:32 - was just
25:35 - like I needed to do something so I
25:37 - started applying like I thought maybe
25:39 - I'm ready like maybe I can apply and get
25:42 - like an actual coding job like a
25:45 - professional job
25:48 - um that was that was an experience your
25:51 - first trying to apply to your first
25:53 - professional job as a developer as a
25:56 - self-taught developer oh my gosh as an
25:59 - introverted self-taught developer who's
26:01 - also very desperate for something
26:04 - anything was crazy I um I went through
26:08 - like three or four interviews at
26:09 - different companies like didn't even
26:10 - pass the first
26:12 - screening um and I don't even know how
26:15 - this happened honestly like I one day
26:17 - late at night it was like 12:00 at night
26:20 - I was like three glasses of wine in
26:22 - playing video games um and I looked at
26:26 - LinkedIn and there was this one post
26:28 - like for a job it wasn't even web
26:30 - developer it was web content
26:32 - administrator and I was like that sounds
26:35 - great like it has it's like kind of
26:37 - Webby you know and I know kind of Webby
26:40 - like so I applied and 10 minutes later
26:43 - the recruiter responded like oh this is
26:44 - great like let's talk tomorrow and that
26:47 - was like the first time that I was like
26:48 - I was I put my glass down I was like oh
26:50 - my gosh okay okay maybe maybe so then
26:53 - the next day I talked to the recruiter
26:55 - she was wonderful like so incredibly
26:57 - kind and
26:59 - just passed me on to the manager and
27:03 - somehow like she gave me this I remember
27:06 - the take-home was the PSD file and I had
27:09 - to code it and I was so scared of like
27:11 - asking questions or anything I remember
27:12 - like can I use a framework can I use
27:15 - bootstrap like I was just thinking all
27:16 - these things but I don't want to ask
27:18 - because I don't ask questions right yeah
27:20 - so um yeah I just coded it CSS whatever
27:25 - but I got it she called me and gave me
27:28 - the job and I I'm still friends with
27:29 - that manager to this day like you're
27:31 - going to have a a call next week I think
27:34 - um yeah but yeah they gave me a shot
27:36 - they took a chance on me and were like
27:37 - you don't have any experience really but
27:40 - like yeah it was I mean if you can do
27:42 - the work you can do the work right that
27:44 - was yeah that was the win that I needed
27:46 - like that that right there that job like
27:48 - it was everything right like they the
27:50 - pay was awful but this large mortgage
27:54 - company like allowed me to like go kind
27:56 - of nuts too right like
27:59 - uh they had like contest sites which
28:00 - were super fun like you know we want to
28:02 - do a cool like um Lottery and so I was
28:07 - like oh okay you want to do like a
28:08 - lottery I'm like okay well what if you
28:11 - get like realistic looking Lottery balls
28:13 - and then what if you have like a screen
28:16 - where they you know flip and then the
28:18 - lottery number comes out then what if
28:20 - you drop it down this like realistic
28:21 - looking little tube and then they like
28:24 - drop down and then confetti comes out
28:26 - and all this really cool stuff stuff and
28:28 - they were like yeah if you can do it
28:30 - just do it and I couldn't but I figured
28:32 - it out like it was all those like cool
28:34 - ideas that you just need someone to be
28:36 - like yeah go nuts when you get excited
28:37 - about something and then that's where
28:39 - you learn right like yeah well it's cool
28:41 - first of all that you're like basically
28:43 - making all this work for yourself a lot
28:45 - of people who are lazy might just be
28:46 - like oh sure good enough but you're like
28:48 - no it could do you see the potential for
28:50 - what this project could be and you're
28:52 - like let's let's go all the way with
28:54 - this project yeah yeah and it's like
28:56 - it's a forgettable project like it was
28:58 - just for that year but it was super fun
29:00 - to do um there was another one where
29:02 - they had like a Halloween contest and I
29:04 - thought what if we make this look old
29:06 - school and so I had like an old school
29:07 - looking TV that I put like a screen over
29:09 - so it looks like we're on the screen and
29:12 - then little I made little CSS Polaroids
29:15 - and like did a cute little I don't know
29:17 - it's so much fun to just do like weird
29:19 - cute little things that people are just
29:21 - like oh that's that's creative that's
29:23 - weird yeah yeah well so what is it like
29:28 - settling in cuz you I mean you mentioned
29:30 - you're like hardcore introvert like
29:33 - afraid to ask people questions willing
29:35 - to toil for an entire week on a problem
29:37 - rather than just asking for help like
29:39 - did you have to report to an office like
29:41 - like who were you working with um I was
29:43 - yeah so I actually worked at an office
29:46 - um and the manager above me she was who
29:51 - I reported directly to it's just me her
29:53 - and this one other girl that were the U
29:56 - developers not really Developers there
29:58 - was one other developer and he was
29:59 - really he was way better than both of us
30:02 - but um pretty much it was just me
30:04 - reporting to my manager and so she was
30:08 - she she's a developer she was
30:09 - self-taught as well um so yeah she she
30:13 - helps me out a lot she gave me a bunch
30:15 - of ideas on things to do and um you know
30:18 - I I remember like freaking out I would
30:19 - have like a bunch of question she like
30:21 - basically calmed me down and told me
30:23 - like you can ask questions like it's not
30:26 - you know or she would she was very
30:28 - patient with me at first because I freak
30:30 - out very easily as well since I don't
30:32 - want to ask questions like I don't know
30:33 - if I'm doing the right thing which I
30:35 - need to just ask if I'm doing the right
30:37 - this so like it's just it's a lot of
30:38 - patience when you're a manager with the
30:40 - first time like Stu like not student
30:42 - with the self-taught firsttime job she
30:45 - was very kind I got very lucky very
30:48 - lucky yeah and I'm thrilled that it
30:50 - worked out well and you and you kind of
30:52 - stayed uh in that uh mortgage space
30:55 - which let's talk about that for a second
30:57 - because I think a lot of people Envision
31:00 - oh I'm going to work at Google or I'm
31:02 - going to work at you know Microsoft or
31:04 - one of these big prominent tech
31:05 - companies that that's their eventual
31:07 - goal and what I always tell people is
31:09 - two-thirds of all Developer jobs are
31:12 - outside of what we conventionally think
31:14 - of as Tech right they're they're working
31:16 - at like you know an automotive company
31:19 - or uh Hospital chain or any number of
31:21 - different types of uh Industries right
31:26 - everybody needs developers everybody's
31:27 - trying to push push things to the
31:28 - software developer or to the software
31:30 - layer everybody's trying to figure out
31:33 - uh ways that they can better reach
31:35 - customers through technology things like
31:37 - that right so right yeah maybe you could
31:39 - talk a little bit about that like
31:41 - because you uh up until relatively
31:45 - recently you were working in kind of
31:46 - like the the mortgage industry right
31:51 - yeah yeah and honestly like I for just
31:54 - starting out like I knew that I wasn't
31:56 - ever going to get into like Google or
31:58 - LinkedIn or and Netflix whatever so I
32:02 - you know go for the easier jobs and
32:03 - everything
32:05 - but even I don't know yeah like you said
32:08 - the most of the tech jobs are not in
32:11 - those companies they're and just like
32:13 - what sounds almost like boring companies
32:15 - but it's they're great jobs they're a
32:18 - lot of fun you get to do a lot of things
32:20 - like as long as you have a good manager
32:21 - and good working environment like you're
32:24 - Off to the Races it's great and it's a
32:26 - lot of fun yeah some of the the I mean
32:28 - just because it's like an industry
32:30 - that's like really old doesn't mean
32:31 - there's not really exciting work to be
32:33 - done in that field and a lot of those
32:36 - companies are you know the jobs are a
32:38 - lot more stable and um it can be a lot
32:42 - more like better work life balance and
32:44 - things like that then going to some
32:46 - crazy like Silicon Valley like Tech
32:48 - startup where they expect you to work
32:50 - like all day every day and like yeah
32:53 - exactly yeah like and you know someone
32:56 - at Google isn't going to let me go nuts
32:57 - on a landing page for a lottery like for
33:00 - fun you know but you can do that at
33:02 - companies that aren't only like tech
33:04 - tech yeah you know you can go and just
33:08 - do fun weird crazy things at different
33:10 - companies and it sounds like you were
33:11 - working on a pretty small team you you
33:13 - said there were just a couple other
33:14 - developers yeah uh and I always tell
33:17 - people like working on a small team
33:18 - gives you the ability to do a lot of
33:20 - everything would you agree with that
33:22 - sentiment yeah absolutely yeah you kind
33:25 - of have to wear a bunch of hats because
33:27 - it's the team is so small yeah um and
33:31 - you know you kind of grow and learn
33:32 - together which is a great part of being
33:34 - in a small team yeah so that first
33:36 - couple years of working in Tech like
33:39 - what what were some of and when I say
33:41 - working in Tech we just established it's
33:42 - a it's a mortgage company but working as
33:44 - a developer sometimes I use working in
33:46 - Tech and working as a developer
33:48 - synonymously um but uh what was that
33:51 - like like what were were there any like
33:54 - standout moments in your kind of
33:57 - progression as a developer where you
33:59 - felt like you just unlocked some entire
34:01 - new aspect of your brain that you didn't
34:03 - know
34:04 - existed yeah yeah like just any kind of
34:07 - like the creativity idea like the um
34:10 - creating the little realistic balls
34:11 - you're like oh my gosh okay so I could
34:13 - do that and then I learn illustrator and
34:14 - then I can bring that SVG into into code
34:19 - and then animate that with JavaScript
34:21 - like what yeah I didn't even know I
34:23 - could do that like you just yeah that
34:25 - you unlocked um I remember we read about
34:29 - some sort of uh the accessibility like
34:32 - the lawsuits and everything that was all
34:33 - starting when I first started there uh
34:36 - we started that kind of unlocked
34:38 - everything so I was like I didn't know
34:39 - anything about accessibility really so I
34:41 - started reading more and then we like we
34:44 - uh went back and like made thousands of
34:47 - landing pages that we have for that
34:48 - company just like accessible so that
34:50 - like unlocked something else like oh my
34:52 - gosh like people you know like need
34:56 - people that aren't me that need to like
34:58 - read this everyone needs to be able to
35:00 - like learn and read this so that that
35:02 - was great too like yeah the you know the
35:06 - the late 2010s whatever that decade is
35:09 - called like that was really a
35:10 - Renaissance for accessibility we're
35:12 - still feeling that today like uh there
35:16 - there's so many different websites and
35:18 - and sub pages and everything that can be
35:21 - gone through and made accessible and
35:23 - it's like yeah it's it's not that much
35:26 - work and it makes all the difference for
35:28 - so many people uh I think something like
35:31 - 15% of people on earth live with a
35:34 - disability right um so yeah it sounds
35:37 - like really important impactful work so
35:39 - you were able to like sit down and like
35:42 - okay today I'm making these pages exess
35:44 - Bill and like did that was that a good
35:46 - feeling like were you able to like what
35:49 - was your mom thinking this entire time I
35:51 - guess curious because she's seen her
35:53 - daughter go from you know College
35:55 - Dropout who's like you know getting
35:58 - tickets because her car is too uh old
36:01 - and Rusty old and Rusty uh and you know
36:04 - like like kind of like uh living a hand
36:06 - to mouth existence so to speak and now
36:09 - she's going out there and having such an
36:10 - impact helping uh improve these websites
36:13 - and yeah like what did she ever talk
36:17 - with you about that oh yeah yeah I mean
36:20 - I tell my mom everything so she was very
36:21 - excited for me like anything cool that I
36:23 - did or something I sent her I mean like
36:25 - I even I even called her when I won like
36:28 - this Call of Duty war zone game like I
36:30 - she I tell her like everything right
36:32 - like so yeah no she was proud she's
36:34 - aware like she's like I didn't even know

36:38 - sister she was giving birth and I was in
36:40 - the hospital like learning with my
36:41 - laptop like oh okay so I could move this
36:43 - here and this that because you know

37:33 - for me when I was when I was real down
37:37 - in the dumps um yeah it's it's been
37:40 - great it there's nothing like having a
37:42 - supportive spouse when you're trying to
37:43 - learn and like pivot into something
37:46 - completely different like when he met me
37:48 - I didn't even have a job and I didn't
37:50 - know what I was doing and he still was
37:52 - just like yeah I like her yeah so that
37:55 - was great like you know you like he
37:57 - likes you for you so that's great um
38:00 - then he uh he his job got moved to
38:03 - Houston so I had to move to Houston with
38:06 - him so I moved to a different part of
38:09 - the mortgage company to the different
38:11 - office but that's kind of where
38:13 - everything changed too because that's
38:15 - when I was like okay so
38:18 - maybe you know it just once you move
38:20 - cities you kind of start like taking
38:23 - like looking at your life and being like
38:24 - okay I think I can I think I'm like
38:26 - ready you know to do something a little
38:28 - bit bigger than what what this is like I
38:30 - want to I want to move on and my husband
38:33 - was amazing about everything just like
38:34 - yeah like you should like I think you're
38:36 - great like as a husband does but um yeah
38:39 - I think that that move if it weren't for
38:42 - him and that whole move and everything I
38:44 - don't I'm not even sure where I would
38:46 - where I would be like yeah he helps me a
38:49 - lot and without him I don't I wouldn't
38:51 - even be a developer yeah yeah wow well
38:54 - um gooders to him for uh being so
38:56 - supportive that that's really chill my
38:58 - wife was extremely supportive when me as
39:01 - like a 31y old man hey I'm going to stop
39:03 - being a School director I'm going to
39:04 - learn the code she was super she had and
39:07 - she practically as a as an American she
39:09 - had insurance through her company so I
39:12 - had health insurance coverage even
39:13 - though I was just you know heads down
39:15 - for like nine months learning the code
39:17 - while I was at the library and stuff so
39:20 - um yeah that's super chill that he was
39:22 - there uh to support you and um it not
39:26 - just emotionally but like with your your
39:28 - $40
39:30 - ticket so yeah maybe we can talk about
39:34 - this new Awakening when you arrive in
39:36 - Houston Houston is one of the biggest
39:38 - cities in the United States uh it's like
39:41 - the Metroplex that the Dallas Fort Worth
39:44 - Metroplex and and the Houston Metroplex
39:46 - they're they're like the two biggest
39:48 - parts of Texas which is the second
39:50 - biggest state right behind California in
39:52 - terms of population uh they're even
39:54 - though they're both in Texas they're
39:56 - pretty far away from from each other
39:57 - like it takes me about 4 hours to drive
39:59 - down to Houston from here maybe you
40:01 - could talk about what it was like
40:02 - arriving in this big city is this the
40:03 - biggest city you've ever lived in yeah
40:06 - yeah it is so I mean we and we moved to
40:10 - like a really nice little apartment like
40:12 - in the middle of like the heights so it
40:14 - was just like bustling stuff everywhere
40:16 - like bars restaurants like it was so
40:18 - cool to see all that cuz we didn't have
40:20 - that before we I'd never like lived in
40:22 - like a really cool part of a city you
40:24 - know so it was fun and it was fun seeing
40:26 - like all these people
40:28 - like you know you like successful people
40:31 - around you like it just helps you like
40:32 - you know talk to people like neighbors
40:34 - and stuff just like seeing what they're
40:36 - doing how hard they're working like it
40:39 - it is kind of an Awakening like just
40:40 - being just getting taken out of your
40:43 - comfort zone is an Awakening no matter
40:45 - what you do right like it's so it was
40:47 - just it was a huge inspiration that like
40:50 - I want to I now that I'm like more
40:52 - comfortable with change I want to I want
40:54 - to do more I want to like do a lot more
40:58 - actually so yeah and I was thinking like
41:01 - okay like how do I even improve my code
41:03 - how do I get better like I need to get
41:05 - better like it was I I think I got a
41:07 - little bit complacent at the mortgage
41:09 - company um but that move really helped
41:12 - with that so I was like maybe I'll start
41:13 - like a 100 days of code I've seen that
41:15 - like on Twitter where
41:17 - I uh I started a account like 10 years
41:20 - ago and it was just there I was like
41:22 - okay maybe and then the pandemic hit
41:25 - yeah and that's what like we all started
41:28 - working from home so I had even more
41:30 - time in the day so I really like I was
41:31 - like I'll just do 100 days of code and I
41:36 - started that and I started posting I had
41:38 - five followers like I was just posting
41:41 - yes and then also sending it to my
41:43 - mother um but she wasn't going to join
41:45 - Twitter so it's just five followers and
41:46 - my mom on the side uh and yeah it just
41:50 - like every day I was just striving to
41:52 - just get a little bit better like a
41:53 - little bit better just uh you know it
41:56 - started off with
41:57 - like how to do like a little falling
42:01 - down animation in sequence like a make a
42:04 - word fall down like the letters like hit
42:06 - each other yeah you know things like
42:08 - that like super silly things like I got
42:10 - really into loading animations just to
42:11 - learn animations like and the more I
42:14 - posted the more like I saw people were
42:16 - like oh that's cool that's cool and I'm
42:17 - like oh my gosh other people think
42:18 - that's cool and so then I got inspired
42:20 - looking at other people's code and it
42:22 - just oh my gosh it gets so exciting once
42:25 - you like finally start talking to other
42:27 - people like that that opened up
42:28 - everything like Twitter just like I was
42:31 - like whoa like everyone is so talented
42:35 - 100 days of code Twitter like I mean
42:37 - you've got 50,000 followers now so you
42:40 - literally grew your following by 10,000
42:42 - times in this time uh posting uh about
42:46 - yeah just posting things that I make
42:48 - that I think are kind of cool like
42:50 - that's it yeah and that I mean that's
42:54 - the secret like there's so much
42:55 - authenticity when I like scroll through
42:57 - your Twitter feed and as like you're
42:59 - just being you you're You're Building
43:01 - you're using your skills to build things
43:02 - that you think are interesting uh let's
43:05 - talk about like agency life like working
43:09 - at an agency so you're no longer at a
43:11 - mortgage company now you're working at a
43:14 - kind of like Dev consultancy agency
43:16 - doing work probably for a lot of
43:18 - different companies can you talk about
43:19 - that a little bit yeah it's so much fun
43:22 - to work at an agency like I don't I even
43:25 - told my husband recently like I don't
43:26 - think I could see myself moving to like
43:28 - another corporate job like that cuz
43:30 - agency like you you get to work on
43:33 - everything like you know it's not just
43:35 - one project and you're improving it
43:37 - forever or whatever it's new projects
43:40 - new projects like can you do this I
43:41 - don't know how but we'll figure it out
43:43 - like it's so much fun it's chaotic
43:45 - agency life is so chaotic and it's like
43:47 - you have to wear so many hats CU you're
43:49 - not a big corporate company you're just
43:51 - an agency so like oh you need to figure
43:53 - out how to do reports on Google
43:54 - analytics okay like I guess we'll figure
43:56 - this out um
43:58 - or oh you need X Y and Z like okay we're
44:00 - going to figure out how to do that or
44:03 - you need like a video platform you know
44:05 - so agency life is just really really fun
44:07 - like if you want to ever level up like
44:09 - crazy it's it's going to be in my
44:10 - opinion at an agency yeah and I've heard
44:12 - the same from so many people that work
44:14 - at agencies like you just get to work on
44:17 - so many more projects uh if you work at
44:19 - a big company that might stick you in a
44:21 - department and you just work on that you
44:23 - know code base for years you know um but
44:26 - you're I mean how many different
44:27 - projects are you taking on a year would
44:29 - you say if you were to
44:31 - estimate oh my gosh probably
44:34 - like probably like 15 or so 15 projects
44:37 - a year that you're touching yeah yeah
44:40 - yeah and then like a lot of them a lot
44:42 - of projects I'm also just like keeping
44:45 - up with and adding to but like new
44:47 - projects new things yeah about 15 I'd
44:50 - say yeah and you're you're able to work
44:52 - remotely yeah yeah most of my all of my
44:56 - co-workers are in seatt and I'm the only
44:57 - one in Texas cuz they said oh it's the
45:00 - pandemic we'll hire someone from out of
45:01 - state yeah I just met them like a month
45:04 - ago in real life for the first time so
45:06 - that's exciting that's cool yeah uh yeah
45:08 - a lot of tech up in Seattle uh and like
45:12 - a lot of you know big customers and
45:13 - stuff so it makes sense that they'd be
45:15 - out there um but that's that's so cool
45:17 - that you know you can live in Houston of
45:19 - course uh you know being a Texan growing
45:22 - up here I used to live in Houston when I
45:24 - was a kid actually uh I probably left
45:27 - Houston because I'm a bit older than you
45:28 - I was probably not living in Houston uh
45:31 - obviously not now but I think I lived
45:33 - there till I was like six or wait I
45:35 - lived there from like age five to like
45:37 - age 10 I think so I lived there for five
45:39 - years yeah and that was my kind of Texas
45:42 - upbringing and my first um encounter
45:44 - with the humidity and the heat
45:47 - of it's insane like you don't think it's
45:50 - going to be that bad and it's like way
45:52 - worse than you could ever imagine yeah
45:54 - especially for someone with curly hair
45:57 - oh my gosh
45:59 - so I'm really excited to learn a little
46:02 - bit more about lessons you've learned
46:04 - from this because overcoming to some
46:06 - extent your introversion and uh being
46:09 - able to get things done on teams working
46:12 - with clients um of course learning the
46:15 - code really well um not just front end
46:18 - development but like going extremely
46:19 - deep on CSS
46:22 - specifically that's so cool what are
46:24 - some observations that you have about
46:27 - your journey that like you think would
46:28 - be like super actionable for someone
46:30 - like what advice would you send back in
46:32 - time to
46:33 - yourself well yeah great question a like
46:37 - um 100% like main one is ask for help
46:40 - when you're stuck because otherwise
46:43 - you're going to spend so much
46:44 - unnecessary time just being stuck when
46:47 - you don't actually have to be and people
46:48 - are a lot nicer than you think they
46:51 - are yeah um anyone needs anything I'm
46:54 - happy to like help always Reach Out me
46:57 - I'm totally here um what else let's see
47:01 - 100 days of code 100 just consistency
47:04 - pretty much is what it is right like you
47:06 - can spend like 3 hours learning how to
47:09 - do something and then you don't touch it
47:11 - again you're going to forget yeah that
47:13 - was a huge deal for me that was
47:14 - something that like feels obvious but I
47:16 - needed to learn like 17 times before I
47:18 - finally got it so really it's just the
47:21 - consistency sharing your code is
47:23 - important to me I mean a lot of people
47:25 - probably don't think it's a good idea
47:29 - maybe you don't want to share on social
47:30 - media maybe you know you're scared to
47:32 - post But like everyone again is so kind
47:35 - and it's fun to get feedback maybe you
47:37 - learn something you can do better um
47:40 - it's just it's very important to like
47:41 - talk to other developers just get out of
47:43 - your box a little bit and just learn you
47:46 - know and if you think something looks
47:47 - cool try to figure out how to do it try
47:49 - to like Decon deconstruct it see how
47:52 - they do that like just being curious
47:55 - when you feel yourself getting
47:56 - complacent and like try to like you know
47:59 - see that that's like a feeling and
48:00 - that's what you're doing like try to
48:01 - recognize it and try to Pivot a little
48:04 - bit from that but also don't get burned
48:07 - out because I've done that so many times
48:10 - that yeah it's like a habit we talk
48:12 - about that real quick because I mean
48:14 - that like that's the biggest
48:15 - occupational hazard other than like
48:16 - repetitive stress injury or eye strain
48:19 - or uh some people uh I know have got
48:21 - like vertigo from staring at a screen
48:23 - too much and things like that which is
48:25 - very debilitating but like burnout is
48:28 - very real and like a lot of people that
48:30 - I've talked to have gone through periods
48:32 - of burnout
48:34 - can when was the I I guess the first
48:36 - time you started feeling burned out and
48:39 - what did that feel
48:40 - like um the first time was when I
48:43 - started posting a lot on social media
48:45 - that I felt like I should probably keep
48:47 - posting I should make I should keep
48:48 - making more CSS art like you kind of
48:50 - start getting in this mode that you're
48:51 - like I need to keep learning I need to
48:52 - keep posting like you kind of start
48:54 - moving into like robotic mode almost um
48:58 - and then I started getting less excited
49:00 - I started getting more tired I started
49:02 - dreading opening up social media like
49:05 - that's when I was like uh oh like this
49:07 - what am I doing
49:08 - but I'm so stubborn that I just kind of
49:11 - try to push through it and then you burn
49:12 - out yeah um and I actually just came out
49:16 - of a burnout recently too because I
49:17 - don't when I get an idea in my head I
49:19 - get so excited I get just so hyped I
49:22 - want to do it night and day like wake up
49:24 - go to sleep do it and then I just just
49:26 - burned myself out so I've kind of
49:29 - resigned myself to the fact that
49:31 - I'm oh sorry that I'm a kind of person
49:33 - that like I'm like a dog with a bone and
49:36 - then once I finish the bone I need like
49:38 - a month break of like extracurriculars
49:40 - and then I can go
49:42 - back yeah I'm so I'm taking so many
49:44 - notes uh because I I feel your
49:46 - description of like you know that that
49:49 - kind of you get into production mode
49:51 - where you're like I've got to ship this
49:53 - and I you know and probably at the same
49:55 - time you know social media is like you
49:57 - see those numbers climb there's uh Jeff
50:00 - Atwood founder of sty overflow whom I've
50:02 - interviewed on uh the uh freeing podcast
50:05 - previously he he has a great saying he
50:07 - says the moment you put a number next to
50:10 - somebody's face that's where like
50:13 - problems happen because people are going
50:15 - to try to make that number go up right
50:18 - and yeah it's it's like a game yeah yeah
50:21 - and I mean you've been so amazing at
50:22 - that game but at the same time it can it
50:25 - can feel like a grind like and it can
50:28 - almost feel like the the the people that
50:30 - are actually like saying kind things and
50:32 - everything that kind of gets abstracted
50:33 - away like people are saying nice things
50:35 - but my number's not going up as fast as
50:37 - it used to or something like that or
50:39 - yeah or like what what's wrong like I
50:40 - just worked really hard on this I
50:42 - published it like have you ever
50:43 - published uh a new piece of art and just
50:46 - felt like it wasn't as well received as
50:48 - your like previous work oh yeah yeah and
50:51 - that's when I have to like step back and
50:52 - be like it's not even it's not even
50:55 - about that like it's just that I get so
50:57 - sad that other people aren't as excited
50:59 - as I am about it but that's okay because
51:01 - like I'm not as excited about everything
51:04 - either it's just like it stings a little
51:06 - bit it stings the heart a little bit
51:07 - after like five hours of working on
51:09 - something yeah like I've written more
51:11 - than 500 articles for like the free C
51:13 - Camp publication and like there was this
51:15 - one that I spent like three days on I
51:17 - worked so hard on it and I was like so
51:18 - proud of it and I published it in like
51:20 - very few people read I mean it was still
51:22 - like you know I feel guilty even saying
51:25 - like oh only a few th000 people read
51:27 - this article but still you know is like
51:29 - you kind of get like acclimated to
51:32 - success and anything that's not like
51:34 - absolute unadulterated success feels
51:36 - like a step down and yeah that
51:38 - definitely kind of like made me question
51:40 - should I really work this hard on a
51:42 - single article if like all of them but
51:44 - obviously like when looking at your art
51:46 - it's clear that you spend a great deal
51:47 - of time on these H how do you do it how
51:51 - do you how do you push forward you know
51:54 - meticulously crafting these pieces uh
51:58 - like is there ever a voice in your head
52:00 - like H people aren't going to like this
52:01 - as much do do you have like a critical
52:03 - voice in your head ever no not when I
52:05 - start it when I start it I like I said
52:07 - dog with the bone I am in it and I'm
52:09 - going to finish this because I'm going
52:10 - to finish this I don't care if this
52:12 - looks weird or hard like I'm going to
52:14 - finish this and then it's not until
52:15 - after that I get like a little hangover
52:17 - like what did I just do or is anyone
52:19 - even going to like this yeah why did I
52:21 - just spend eight hours on this yeah it's
52:23 - it's not during it's after Okay so so
52:27 - that's I mean that's a really con
52:29 - convenient way for your mind to work
52:30 - because for me I'm always doubting
52:31 - things before I even start or as I'm
52:33 - doing it I'm like St to doubt like uh
52:36 - for example like with my music like I
52:38 - created the soundtrack for The learn to
52:40 - code RPG and the whole time like are
52:42 - people going to just think this is janky
52:44 - like is it going to sound amateurish and
52:47 - uh like I was doubting myself the entire
52:49 - time uh so it I would love to have it
52:52 - sounds like a superpower to be able to
52:54 - like just power through and only after
52:55 - you finish working so hard on something
52:57 - do you start to doubt but the work is
52:59 - already done so it's it's like you're
53:01 - not really discourage once the work is
53:03 - already done you just have to like yeah
53:05 - that's that's a really cool Quirk see
53:08 - but that's different though from the
53:10 - from the music because the the art I
53:13 - already know what it needs to look like
53:15 - I know what the endgame is the music you
53:17 - need to be creative and be like okay I
53:19 - have to do this I have to do that the
53:20 - art is already written for like I I just
53:23 - I know I see it and I have to make sure
53:25 - it looks like that at the end so so how
53:27 - does what is your process like so you
53:28 - identify some sort of object or some
53:31 - sort of like maybe you can walk an
53:34 - electronic yeah yeah just walk us
53:36 - through an entire
53:37 - project yeah okay so like I start
53:41 - getting kind of the itch of like okay I
53:42 - kind of want to draw something do
53:43 - creative okay so I start Pinterest um
53:46 - it's already totally geared to like me
53:49 - so it shows me a bunch of electronics
53:51 - with really nice like edges and stuff
53:54 - that um would be easy to draw with CSS
53:56 - art so I just scroll open up a bunch of
53:58 - tabs and then after I have like 10 open
54:01 - I go through those and I'm like okay
54:03 - this
54:04 - one so then I keep that tab open and I
54:11 - put it as a background image on my code
54:13 - and then I just kind of outline the
54:15 - shape of it so that I know the shapes
54:17 - the main shapes are right and then after
54:19 - that I'm off to the races I start with
54:21 - just any little thing that I think is
54:23 - like the easiest thing to start with and
54:25 - from there you just you just go yeah and
54:28 - so so do you do like the big like I mean
54:31 - when you scroll through your landing
54:32 - page it shows like the big squares
54:34 - appear first and then you kind of go
54:35 - through and you add fine details maybe
54:37 - you'll zoom in and really focus on like
54:39 - the flash component and you'll spend a
54:41 - whole lot of time on that and then
54:42 - you'll go do the viewfinder and then
54:44 - you'll do like the lens like how do you
54:47 - because I've seen people draw like I
54:49 - don't I can't draw for the damn but like
54:51 - they'll often like it almost seems
54:53 - arbitrary what they're focused on like
54:55 - they just jump around almost
54:56 - yeah is it so it's just like a yeah it's
54:58 - arbitrary for me it's just whatever
55:00 - looks like I'm going to that's that's
55:02 - what I feel like I'm going to do right
55:03 - now I'm going to just do that and I'm
55:05 - going to focus on it so like I think I
55:07 - did the flash first or I I'm pretty sure
55:09 - it's the flash I'm not very familiar
55:11 - with camera Parts but the flash part um
55:15 - and so I'm like okay I'm going to make
55:16 - this perfect and then I'm like okay that
55:18 - looks good but now it's just like
55:20 - squares and a flash a really nice
55:23 - looking Flash and so then you just move
55:24 - on to the next thing and then the next
55:26 - thing
55:27 - um and then the logo is always the last
55:28 - thing to go on but yeah yeah
55:33 - and I
55:35 - guess how would you recommend somebody
55:37 - if they want to create CSS art like you
55:40 - do if they want to try to create photo
55:43 - realistic images using CSS what would be
55:46 - some tips if somebody let's say that
55:48 - somebody has like a free weekend and
55:50 - they're like I want to get better at CSS
55:51 - and I'm going to use this project I'm
55:53 - going to like you have a a photo real
55:56 - istic Xbox controller right like
55:58 - somebody gets a they they find a photo
56:00 - of an Xbox or maybe like uh some new
56:03 - synthesizer module or something like
56:05 - that that they they just find online and
56:07 - this is like this is a beautiful you
56:09 - know aesthetic piece of hardware and I
56:11 - or or their favorite mechanical keyboard
56:12 - or something they want to recreate that
56:13 - in CSS what would be your advice to
56:17 - getting started with that process and
56:19 - getting better at CSS art yeah so my
56:22 - advice would be for first things first
56:24 - like try to create create something with
56:27 - a single div like learn how to stack
56:30 - backgrounds that's it like that's once
56:32 - you
56:33 - can make like a pretty simple image and
56:36 - you can learn how backgrounds can stack
56:38 - on top of each other how the linear
56:40 - gradients can stack or radial
56:43 - um after that it's pretty simple it's I
56:46 - mean I don't want to say simple but like
56:49 - it's it's tedious but it's simple like
56:52 - it's just very detail oriented but once
56:54 - you figure out how the gradient
56:57 - work in a background and how positioning
56:59 - Works you're you're pretty good it's
57:02 - just starting off like really what I
57:03 - started off with was just single divs
57:05 - and stacking the backgrounds to make
57:07 - something I I think my first one was a
57:09 - window and I just made the window like
57:11 - shiny and I was like oh my gosh and then
57:14 - I was like What if I add a ledge okay
57:16 - let me stock this background and then I
57:19 - can move the background and I can make
57:20 - it be just like x height in the same div
57:25 - and it's a ledge now like it's just that
57:27 - moment that you're just like okay so
57:28 - that's how you do it and then yeah
57:30 - you're good from there really it it
57:33 - looks a lot harder because it than it is
57:35 - because there's so much code but it's
57:37 - it's really not it's the same properties
57:38 - over and over again and it's a lot of
57:40 - fun yeah well are there any projects
57:44 - that you're working on right now and I
57:46 - mean you're working full-time you know
57:48 - you you got like your own personal life
57:49 - and stuff but like do you have any
57:52 - projects that uh you're like I can't
57:54 - wait to build this you don't have to
57:55 - spoil what they're going to be but do
57:57 - you do you have anything that you're
57:59 - getting ready to
58:00 - start um yeah so I I'm working on a CSS
58:04 - course that's uh it took a little bit of
58:07 - a break because of the whole burnout
58:08 - thing um but I I also want to start uh
58:11 - streaming more code um I'm just I'm not
58:16 - sure 100% on how that would work I want
58:18 - to I want to stream CSS art but it takes
58:21 - so long to do that I'm not sure like if
58:23 - that's even a good idea so like that's
58:25 - kind of running around in my head if
58:27 - anyone has any ideas I want to do with
58:28 - that let me know but um that's yeah
58:31 - definitely I want to do more YouTube
58:33 - videos uh and articles I really want to
58:36 - write articles I never write articles we
58:38 - would love to publish some of your
58:39 - articles on uh the free cocam
58:41 - publication if at some point you're
58:42 - interested in in yeah that would be
58:45 - great like a getting started to CSS art
58:47 - article I think would be solid that
58:48 - would be amazing I'd love to publicize
58:50 - that to the community um one thing like
58:53 - this is some unsolicited advice one
58:55 - thing you might consider doing is just
58:57 - keeping your screen recorder going while
58:59 - you're working and then you have this
59:01 - artifact like a recording of you
59:03 - building an entire project and then you
59:06 - could always just speed that up a little
59:07 - bit if it's slow and uh then you you
59:10 - could you know have like a 20x speed
59:13 - because there have been some really cool
59:14 - videos where people are like building
59:16 - uis and stuff and they'll be jumping
59:17 - back and forth from their Editor to the
59:19 - the browser to see what it looks like
59:21 - and stuff and you could just speed that
59:23 - up and put that with some like copyright
59:25 - free music or some like stream okay
59:28 - music and you can put that out that
59:29 - might be a really good way of like
59:30 - testing the water because live streaming
59:33 - is a commitment I spent like a year or
59:36 - two streaming on Twitch and it was so
59:38 - much work compared to like just
59:40 - recording like a a synchronous video and
59:43 - editing it publishing it yeah so I'm not
59:45 - trying to turn anybody off from
59:47 - streaming but it's very hard to get
59:50 - people to like actually watch your
59:52 - stream because they have to be free at
59:54 - that exact moment they have to be like
59:56 - in a place where they're like oh I'm
59:57 - going to sit down I'm going to watch
59:58 - somebody and at the same time twitch has
60:00 - like terrible discoverability you can
60:02 - stream on YouTube but people don't
60:04 - really look at YouTube as like oh I'm
60:06 - streaming on YouTube people think of
60:07 - twitch and twitch doesn't really have a
60:09 - Cate they've got like just chatting
60:10 - they've got like maybe an art category
60:13 - but they don't really have an a category
60:14 - for coding despite the fact that the
60:16 - developer community's been asking for
60:17 - this forever right um oh interesting and
60:20 - that would make a huge difference in
60:21 - terms of discoverability so my humble
60:23 - advice to anybody who's considering
60:25 - streaming like start with YouTube and
60:26 - start with like asynchronously recorded
60:28 - videos where you can edit them and make
60:29 - them more Punchy and stuff it's so much
60:31 - easier to get people to watch a YouTube
60:33 - video that they can watch at any time
60:35 - than to try to get people to tune in at
60:37 - a very specific time to watch you do
60:39 - that and the fact that you can speed it
60:41 - up even if it's not that exciting
60:43 - everything's exciting if you make it
60:44 - fast enough right I agree I agree I need
60:47 - to watch everything faster listen to
60:49 - everything faster like yeah yeah so
60:52 - anyway I apologize for the unsolicited
60:53 - advice but I hope that's helpful that's
60:55 - helpful saves you like no that is 10 or
60:57 - 15 hours of streaming to basically one
61:00 - or two people which is what everybody
61:02 - starts with stream unless you're like
61:04 - what I was going to do yeah yeah even if
61:06 - you have a big Twitter following it's
61:07 - not necessarily going to translate to a
61:09 - whole lot of people tuning in to watch
61:10 - you on on Twitch uh I mean you may have
61:12 - better luck with it than I did but um so
61:16 - you're also developing this course
61:18 - that's going to teach people how to like
61:20 - is just a general CSS course or is it
61:22 - focused specifically on CSS art it's a
61:25 - CSS course focused on CSS art so it's
61:28 - just going to teach you how to it's
61:30 - going to teach you CSS but with the
61:32 - twist of like while you're creating CSS
61:34 - art because I
61:36 - know sometimes when I'm like learning
61:38 - CSS like they show you things and you're
61:40 - like oh well I don't need to know that
61:41 - right now you know I'm Project based
61:44 - learning pretty much like yeah okay
61:45 - we'll do this you know and so like you
61:48 - have to like make a keyboard and you
61:50 - have to use grid things like that
61:53 - like just uh yeah learn CSS
61:56 - for people that are more like art
61:58 - inclined
61:59 - yeah what are your longer term goals I
62:02 - mean you you've got so much momentum and
62:05 - I mean you literally have CSS artist.com
62:07 - great domain name uh and you You' really
62:09 - like built a niche for yourself as
62:12 - somebody who is exceptionally good at
62:14 - this uh where do you have anything like
62:17 - any goals like five 10 years out I don't
62:19 - want to put you on the spot but like
62:21 - where would you ultimately like to be
62:22 - going uh do you see yourself doing a
62:26 - work indefinitely like like what ises
62:28 - the future hold
62:30 - foro um no yeah I think I think agency
62:33 - life is it like I think I just want to
62:35 - keep getting better at what I do get
62:37 - faster you know that's pretty much my
62:39 - goal I don't want to be a CEO of
62:41 - anything I don't want to own my own
62:42 - company like
62:44 - it's I just want to build fun projects
62:46 - forever and like keep learning how to
62:48 - build cool stuff forever I want to learn
62:50 - 3D rendering um I want to retake Bruno
62:54 - Simon uh 3jf gu course cuz I think
62:57 - that's so cool I just want to like
62:59 - that's it really just get way better at
63:01 - everything and that's what I try to do
63:03 - every day just little by little that's
63:06 - that's it my goal is just be a little
63:08 - bit better yeah and I would absolutely
63:10 - leave it there but let's talk about 3js
63:12 - because it's so amazing it's such a cool
63:14 - tool for for building like 3D
63:17 - potentially interactive experiences in
63:19 - the browser yeah what what Drew you to
63:22 - 3GS and maybe you could describe what
63:24 - the what it does
63:26 - so I mean 3js is really just as someone
63:29 - who likes to look at Art and likes
63:31 - realistic things and stuff 3js what drew
63:33 - me to it was you know realistic actual
63:36 - like 3D things on your computer right
63:39 - now everything is like 2D or is it it's
63:42 - two dimensional yeah one dimensional is
63:44 - just like a single line technically is
63:47 - onedimensional I don't think not
63:49 - anything
63:50 - physical okay some physicists will
63:53 - probably correct me there but yeah yeah
63:55 - although
63:56 - I'm GNA I'm goingon to do a shout out to
63:58 - one-dimensional Pac-Man it's Pac-Man but
64:00 - there's just it's a line and you can
64:03 - it'll be hard to describe it but I'm
64:05 - going to add a link to onedimensional
64:07 - Pac-Man in the show notes and if you
64:10 - click this link you are going to waste
64:11 - at least 10 minutes on this thing this
64:13 - game is so it's amazing it's an
64:15 - engineering like design Marvel that it
64:17 - works and is as addictive as it is but
64:19 - all you do is you tap to turn Pacman
64:21 - around and he's either running from the
64:23 - ghost or he's running towards the ghost
64:24 - after he ate a power pet but such an
64:26 - amazing that sounds so cool that but
64:28 - that is like to my knowledge the first
64:29 - onedimensional game I mean not it's not
64:31 - technically one but your the entire
64:33 - gameplay takes it place on a line um
64:36 - that's cool so two-dimensional 3js back
64:39 - to 3js it's two-dimensional uh you you
64:43 - know all the CD even though they have
64:45 - perceived depth to them uh it's still
64:48 - just a two-dimensional thing you can't
64:49 - like grab you know the Polaroid camera
64:51 - and start looking at it from different
64:52 - angles and stuff using CS I mean you
64:54 - might be able to build 3 stuff in CSS
64:57 - but 3js is designed specifically for 3D
65:01 - rendering and like being able to model
65:03 - things and manipulate things in three
65:05 - dimensions right yes right so it's it
65:08 - looks very cool like it's just it brings
65:11 - I don't know it makes the web so much
65:12 - more exciting and I want to get in on
65:14 - that right like you want to learn all of
65:15 - that I've been learning blender and I
65:17 - want to learn how to make animated
65:19 - videos on that I don't know everything
65:20 - 3js 3D and stuff is just like the
65:24 - coolest thing ever for me right now it
65:25 - is what I'm into um so and I've already
65:30 - taken most of Bruno's course Bruno
65:33 - Simon's 3js Journey amazing incredible
65:36 - course I recommend it to everybody okay
65:38 - I'll link to it mhm but yeah no it's so
65:42 - exciting like the whole thing like the
65:44 - things that you can do with your with
65:47 - your code on like using 3js is
65:50 - incredible and I just I want to be that
65:52 - cool what's the most impressive thing
65:53 - you've seen with 3js
65:56 - uh oh my gosh you I'm going to sound
65:58 - like a commercial but Bruno Simon's uh
66:00 - portfolio website is that the one where
66:01 - you're driving the remote control around
66:03 - yes that is amazing I love that uh
66:05 - you're driving like this RC car around
66:07 - and like knocking over bowling pins and
66:09 - stuff okay I'm definitely I'll link to
66:11 - that instead of his course I think that
66:13 - page links to his course but you know
66:15 - along with onedimensional Pac-Man
66:16 - everybody listening you should spend
66:17 - like five minutes just driving this is
66:19 - the best portfolio I've ever seen ever
66:21 - yeah I mean your portfolio is amazing I
66:24 - would put like if there was AER list
66:26 - yours would be like probably s tier but
66:27 - his is like SS tier I mean it's just
66:30 - yeah his is everything yeah his is
66:33 - creative it's like you're like how did
66:35 - he do it's everything I've everything I
66:38 - admire in web like it's it's amazing
66:41 - yeah really so yeah that's that's what I
66:44 - want to do I just want to comment that
66:46 - it's like so cool that like you went
66:49 - from architecture student kind of like
66:51 - down and out and then now you're this
66:54 - widely recognized
66:56 - like uh popular kind of like artist like
66:59 - you're creating art in a time when it's
67:02 - very hard to break through as an artist
67:03 - like it's like the probably the hardest
67:05 - field to ever go into is creating art
67:08 - right and you're doing it and people are
67:11 - checking out your work and you've also
67:12 - been able to Parlay the same skills that
67:14 - you've been doing to develop this art
67:16 - into working as a software engineer as a
67:19 - senior front-end developer at a
67:22 - consultancy as at a design
67:24 - agency I mean that's so cool that you've
67:26 - been able to
67:28 - like take a second chapter turn over a
67:31 - new leaf and go in a completely
67:32 - different direction and find so much
67:34 - success there and uh yeah I mean like
67:38 - what does that feel like insane I feel
67:41 - like I'm like I've lived two different
67:43 - lives right like if you would have asked
67:45 - me 10 years ago where I would be now I
67:47 - don't know what I would have told you
67:48 - but it would not be this like it's cool
67:51 - and it makes you feel like you know you
67:54 - really can do anything like
67:56 - just you're capable of so much more than
67:58 - you think you are all the time it's it's
68:01 - crazy right like it's just don't be
68:03 - complacent like it's it's insane really

68:15 - energy person it's it's very hard for me
68:17 - to imagine you as an introvert who would
68:19 - work on an engineering problem for an
68:21 - entire week because she's too timid to
68:23 - ask for help but I mean obviously you've
68:26 - come an incredibly long way and uh I
68:29 - just I just want to thank you for coming

68:41 - as a role model and have now found you
68:42 - as a role
68:44 - model thank you so much honestly hearing
68:47 - that from you is everything and I cannot

69:20 - I hope everybody walks away with a
69:22 - little bit more inspiration a little bit
69:23 - more knowledge about you know CSS HTML
69:26 - frontend development agency life all
69:29 - these things that we've talked about um
