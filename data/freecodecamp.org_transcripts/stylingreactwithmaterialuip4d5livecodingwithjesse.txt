00:14 - hey everybody and welcome to live coding
00:17 - with Jessie today we're going to do some
00:22 - styling of our our new react project
00:27 - we're using a graph QL to get data from
00:30 - WordPress and we just had a massive pool
00:34 - request that I merged in a few hours ago
00:36 - so let's briefly go through what's
00:40 - changed from that pool request you can
00:42 - check it out at the repo there's a link
00:45 - in the description
00:47 - it'll be pool request number two okay
00:50 - it's already closed cuz it's been merged
00:51 - but you can check that out if you want
00:54 - to look through the files on your own
00:56 - I'm just gonna kind of try to summarize
00:59 - it because it's it's quite large so
01:04 - definitely it would take a long time to
01:06 - go through all the lines that have
01:07 - changed so so Harshit submitted this
01:10 - request basically it merged what he had
01:14 - done in pool request one which we did go
01:18 - over last week so he just closed pool
01:23 - request one and then added all the
01:26 - changes into two so in addition to the
01:31 - things that were added before now
01:33 - material UI the beta version of material
01:37 - you are the newer version that we were
01:38 - trying to get working on friday is now
01:40 - working it's all set up there's a layout
01:43 - component let me show you what it looks
01:46 - like as I'm describing it so here we go
01:54 - so he he actually set up a temporary
01:59 - WordPress installation to grab data from
02:02 - so now actually I am
02:04 - I pulled I had an old test install of
02:09 - WordPress that I hadn't really been
02:12 - using for anything so I just pulled it
02:14 - in it just has some well it has bacon
02:19 - ipsum so instead of lorem ipsum it has
02:21 - the names of different cuts of meat and
02:23 - i grabbed some of these images from
02:27 - so that's like the big picture what's
02:32 - changed there's so much more so I
02:36 - definitely recommend if you really want
02:37 - to understand what changed go through
02:39 - some of the at least some of the pool
02:44 - requests to see and you know line by
02:47 - line what did change I've made some
02:53 - changes in addition to that so harsh its
02:57 - API had for every post there was an
03:02 - image but mine didn't so initially when
03:05 - I tried to pull things in it didn't work
03:06 - I was getting an error so I just simply
03:09 - added in a check to see if there was an
03:12 - image and if there was then we try to
03:14 - render the image if not we don't try to
03:16 - render the image at all so in this case
03:21 - we actually don't even we don't even
03:27 - render this whole section of the card so
03:29 - you'll see in a second if you're not
03:30 - familiar with with this particular
03:32 - component and material UI it would try
03:37 - to render it basically be a big blank
03:40 - area so we just completely pulled that
03:45 - out so I'll show you that now I think
03:47 - it's in the post detail is it no post
03:53 - preview that's what it is because you
03:55 - can see there's there's a lot more
03:57 - components in here than there were last
03:58 - week let's see oh here it is
04:04 - okay so we just did this basically we're
04:06 - just checking to see if an image URL has
04:09 - been passed in from the parent component
04:12 - and then if not we don't do anything if
04:16 - there is one then we we render it and I
04:22 - believe the parent component would be
04:23 - here yeah so in the parent component we
04:27 - do a check to see if there was an image
04:30 - see so we're either passing in or not
04:32 - passing in the the image URL all right
04:38 - so that's I mean that's basically it
04:40 - I other than setting up the graph QL
04:45 - plug-in on the old WordPress
04:48 - installation and updating some other
04:51 - plugins that's that's pretty much all
04:53 - that was done so let's see let's go to
05:02 - say that's all that was done by me I
05:04 - should clarify let's I do want to start
05:11 - it's not not CSS let's start with our
05:14 - app is and no it's not there oh sorry
05:21 - layout I wanted to start from what we're
05:24 - first bringing in material material UI
05:28 - so you can see we have a layout
05:31 - component now and that's what we're
05:33 - importing a bunch of stuff from material
05:35 - UI and then we have some some styles in
05:39 - line here I shouldn't say in line but in
05:42 - in component Styles
05:50 - all right and then here's where we have
05:53 - like our app bar and ice were and our
06:03 - title right so this is these are things
06:05 - that every page needs here we go here's
06:10 - our drawer so that side that side
06:15 - navigation drawer here that's also in
06:21 - the layout and control here so what wind
06:23 - up doing is will list out the categories
06:26 - here as well see and then this is where
06:35 - we pull in the content from the views so
06:43 - let's check out well let's check out our
06:45 - home view now what this looks like
06:51 - let's see so we're pulling in layout
06:54 - everything is wrapped in layout now so
06:59 - everything that was in layout is going
07:01 - to get applied we also have helmet so
07:06 - react helmet and this allows us to
07:07 - change the title rank is normally within
07:10 - a component we don't have access to the
07:12 - stuff that's in the you know in the top
07:16 - of the HTML document but with helmet we
07:20 - do have access to it and we actually can
07:22 - do at some point up we could probably
07:26 - even move this to the layout component
07:29 - and pass in a prop for the title if we
07:34 - wanted to clean it up even more it's not
07:37 - really a big thing but it might save us
07:39 - a few lines so we'd save a line of code
07:42 - up here and a few down here so we may
07:45 - end up doing that all right so maybe
07:51 - that's that's basically it you know we
07:53 - see the post detail page is the same
07:56 - thing laid out the same way category
07:59 - page right now lists it out posts like
08:02 - those for category one but wind up
08:05 - having when we actually hook up the real
08:07 - data for this we're gonna have so many
08:11 - posts that it'll be way too many to put
08:14 - on the page like this so I mean this
08:18 - works it works for now but we have I
08:23 - think we definitely have hundreds of
08:25 - posts already so we'll have the
08:28 - categories listed on the side and then
08:32 - when you click a category it'll have
08:33 - each page will be like a single category
08:36 - page but this looks I mean this is
08:39 - pretty amazing
08:40 - how much Harshit got done and just a day
08:44 - or two so thank you so much for that
08:47 - this gives us like a huge jump start so
08:52 - yeah and I did I just checked a lot chat
08:55 - now I see harsh it mentioned downgrading
08:58 - WP graphic you also in fact I did we had
09:00 - a little bit of discussion on Friday
09:02 - about it hard
09:03 - recommended downgrading I really kind of
09:06 - wanted to see like what could I make the
09:08 - latest version work and right after the
09:11 - stream I I spent a little bit of time
09:13 - checking it out and I just I decided to
09:17 - go with harsha's advice and just
09:18 - downgrade and that it worked so for now
09:23 - we're gonna do it like that
09:24 - later on I don't know we'll see I
09:29 - actually may want to have the
09:32 - authentication but right now since we're
09:38 - just testing I really don't want to add
09:40 - in that whole extra element of
09:41 - complexity and having to use like JSON
09:45 - web tokens or something that's just
09:49 - gonna it I feel like at this point I
09:52 - want to get it developed out more you
09:55 - know kind of tangibly what we can see
09:57 - and then we can tackle the
09:58 - authentication I'm still I still need to
10:00 - get in contact with someone about the
10:03 - single sign-on and see you know what
10:07 - what that's gonna involve and
10:09 - integrating that with our project so
10:12 - there's just too many things I don't
10:14 - know yet about how that's gonna work so
10:16 - we're just gonna put that off until
10:18 - later on okay I'm just checking the live
10:23 - chat briefly see if there's anything I
10:27 - should respond to right now okay all
10:35 - right also harsh it reminded me to start
10:39 - the end Rock server so I'm starting that
10:42 - right now and I will copy the link in so
10:46 - if you're not familiar with the end rock
10:48 - server this basically lets you all test
10:50 - out what I have here that I'm running on
10:53 - localhost
10:54 - so if you click the link that I just
10:55 - pasted it in the live chat you can see
10:57 - this you can inspect it you can use your
11:01 - dev tools so if you have react installed
11:03 - with your chrome dev tools you'll be
11:04 - able to see that if you have the dev
11:09 - tools that you use with graph QL you can
11:11 - see that it even responds to
11:15 - the Redux dev tools as well because
11:18 - Redux is going you know doing its thing
11:20 - behind the scenes of Apollo so I mean
11:26 - not it's a little bit different than
11:28 - you'd normally see in react state right
11:32 - because there's I mean Apollo
11:35 - understands what's going on but it's not
11:37 - really like friendly for people to read
11:39 - quite as much as if you'd make your own
11:42 - store but you can go in here to apollo
11:46 - stuff and check all this stuff out check
11:52 - out your queries so it's kind of nice
11:58 - because then it could be more
12:00 - interactive you could actually you know
12:02 - check out what's going on in real time
12:04 - okay so here's what we're gonna do today
12:07 - I know that was kind of a long intro
12:09 - uh-huh it's like um like a 15-minute
12:12 - intro but we had a significant pool
12:14 - request so I definitely needed needed to
12:17 - go over that some of those changes so
12:20 - here's what we want to do we definitely
12:23 - need to change the color scheme to match
12:26 - the university color scheme we'll
12:28 - probably add the University logo in here
12:31 - somewhere
12:33 - maybe up here we'll see we'll see it
12:40 - makes the most sense and we're gonna
12:42 - change up the other the homepage here so
12:50 - let's try to get the categories listed
12:52 - down the side and this you this is
12:59 - actually perfect the size and everything
13:02 - but we I also want some other view
13:06 - options available so we can simply get
13:08 - some icons over here so the users can
13:12 - select some of the other options would
13:15 - you see how it's going I'd like to get
13:17 - to Pomodoro sessions in if I can but
13:20 - since I'm starting my first session so
13:22 - far into the stream we'll just have to
13:26 - see how it goes I have a meeting coming
13:28 - up in about an hour so I don't want to
13:34 - be late for that when the the head of my
13:39 - department will be in the meeting so
13:41 - definitely don't want to mess around and
13:44 - I I need to get a little bit of data to
13:48 - present at that meeting so it will be a
13:52 - shorter stream than normal but hopefully
13:54 - we can get something useful in so I'm
13:57 - gonna stop talking about about this and
14:00 - I get to the stream let's see
14:10 - all right so we should probably check
14:13 - the documentation for material UI first
14:16 - and I guess the first thing we could do
14:19 - that will hopefully be pretty easy is
14:22 - just change some of the colors so
14:26 - actually not now that I think about it I
14:29 - don't think we need to check the
14:31 - documentation since we have in the
14:34 - layout page we have a lot of styles here
14:36 - it's probably here somewhere so let's
14:42 - just check it out
14:52 - there'd be color here the only color
14:55 - thing I see here is this background
14:58 - color but looks like that's for the
14:59 - content so let's make sure
15:12 - all right so we will check out the
15:14 - documentation so probably probably
15:20 - themed you see how we're bringing this
15:25 - in
15:36 - I just list the live chat and Brett said
15:40 - this demo is making me hungry yeah I
15:42 - [Music]
15:45 - actually just got off the phone with
15:47 - tech support for Google Phi and the
15:51 - woman on tech support was super nice and
15:53 - she was telling me about what she had
15:54 - for lunch
15:55 - and she made this pasta with alfredo
15:58 - sauce from scratch she's telling me how
16:00 - she made it with heavy cream and stuff
16:02 - I'm like I have anybody who's vegetarian
16:05 - or vegan I'm not trying to upset you
16:09 - if it is really offensive to somebody
16:12 - let me know I can change it up but this
16:16 - was just what I already had in here from
16:18 - a while ago so I know my brother's a
16:21 - vegan so I guess I'm I have to think
16:26 - about that all the time now in case if
16:29 - he's going to be over I can't put meat
16:31 - in anything all right okay so what
16:36 - Dorothy wants I don't think we're set up
16:42 - right now with a theme
16:50 - right
16:52 - we're not pulling that in that would
16:59 - probably be the way we want to go Oh
17:01 - actually no we are pulling maybe I'm
17:07 - just missing it
17:17 - let's see
17:22 - haha Bret says there's not a vegan ipsum
17:25 - yet alright
17:39 - okay so in case in case you're not
17:44 - following what's what I'm trying to do
17:46 - here I was basically looking for if we
17:50 - had pulled in something like this from
17:53 - materialized styles but it looks like
17:55 - we're pulling in with styles from
17:58 - material us styles so
18:11 - I'm not sure I'm not sure if we could
18:18 - change these I guess we could try
18:38 - hmmm alright so I was looking for
18:40 - something that was matching up with what
18:42 - we were already changing it here
18:53 - all right so
18:58 - let's let's keep looking a little bit
19:00 - yes we could try to override I'd rather
19:07 - not override for the for the colors
19:13 - because you know we're gonna have a
19:15 - certain color palette that we want to be
19:18 - applied throughout
19:28 - mmm
19:33 - you know see if it says something
19:59 - no bus not only I thought we were gonna
20:06 - start out with something easy and it
20:07 - turns out it's not so easy okay well
20:11 - then let's let's just start here with
20:14 - this theme then and maybe we'll
20:17 - implement this
20:52 - okay
20:55 - all right so actually so hard should is
21:01 - saying theme is the right way to do it
21:03 - so just just for me so I'm clear Harshit
21:08 - so do you mean should we go with adding
21:10 - this in and wrapping everything in this
21:12 - Mui theme provider or are you saying
21:16 - that basically what we have going on
21:18 - here is sufficient and I can just add
21:20 - into this and it would it would work
21:45 - okay so 1010 damer says you should wrap
21:49 - your app in the Mui theme provider
21:53 - Harshit says theme okay so this will
21:58 - apply throughout
22:17 - okay I'm getting I'm getting it seems
22:29 - like conflicting advice here
22:32 - I guess that for now let's just try to
22:36 - put in something into the the current
22:42 - theme object and see if it'll change
22:44 - some stuff so let's just copy I want to
22:52 - find somewhere there we go
22:54 - primary so I'd like to take all right
23:03 - this is nested and so I'm gonna take
23:08 - this palette which trying to find where
23:14 - it ends but it just is not ending all
23:17 - right let me let me just move this to
23:20 - the other screen and I'll just type it
23:22 - out of it all right so let's see
23:34 - instead of steam
23:44 - Opa le TT and primary
23:58 - the primary and goodness
24:13 - I really would rather not have to
24:15 - manually put all these in for now let's
24:25 - see
24:43 - -
24:46 - she said it people that I can't remember
24:51 - with that hex color is no-limit
24:54 - execution
25:04 - forget the comma straighten up
25:13 - all right nothing changed a big change
25:17 - from that I mean you think that'd be the
25:20 - primary color right
25:31 - okay all right so now ours just saying
25:34 - we could import so let's import this
25:52 - now should I also import with styles or
25:56 - are we gonna get rid of that and replace
25:58 - it with with some of this let's rap
26:07 - let's wrap everything in that
26:48 - what did i do i okay i messed up on the
26:56 - capitalization there we go alright let's
27:00 - see
27:13 - okay so harsh it's pasting in some some
27:19 - code for me here so let me put this in
27:41 - okay all right so now let's just bring
27:48 - this in
28:12 - see ok well it didn't change that but we
28:15 - didn't get errors so I guess that's ok
28:19 - so case for now alright so now let's see
28:22 - woods
28:35 - who
28:42 - okay I did not put the theme in down
28:49 - here thanks ah if you're just
28:54 - joining you didn't see the beginning so
28:56 - a hard submitted a pool request
28:58 - over the weekend that implemented this
29:00 - material UI v1 and so that's why I'm
29:05 - getting a lot of advice from him because
29:07 - I didn't I didn't implement this so I'm
29:10 - just trying to learn as we go and while
29:14 - I'm not normally an expert at things I'm
29:16 - usually not quite this clueless but I'm
29:22 - benefiting greatly from from Harsha in
29:24 - this stream yeah all right it works
29:28 - great
29:31 - alright so already over a half hour into
29:36 - the stream and we got our first thing to
29:39 - work okay awesome so now at least we
29:42 - know that this is set up in a way that
29:45 - you know we can go ahead and change a
29:49 - lot of things in our theme like this
29:51 - obviously I wouldn't want every one of
29:53 - these values to be green but I don't
29:55 - want to try to calculate this on my own
29:57 - I'll probably try to find I'm sure
30:00 - there's some material design calculator
30:03 - where I can pop in the base color and
30:04 - it'll produce all these for me so
30:09 - alright so we have the color in here
30:11 - that was that was step one that's what
30:13 - we wanted to do first so let's do some
30:25 - shree do let's see if we can put in a
30:30 - logo and maybe some of our some icons up
30:36 - here so we haven't tried to deal with
30:39 - icons yet in this new version of
30:41 - material UI so maybe we can figure out
30:44 - how to do that let's figure out how to
30:46 - do that first since that's kind of new I
30:48 - mean put an image in is probably not
30:52 - going to be that hard this is kind of
30:53 - basic let's see oops so I guess we're
31:05 - good in the app bar component so let's
31:07 - check this out
31:08 - and off I'm looking for where the
31:14 - material ID documentation is I moved it
31:16 - over on the other screen also I just
31:18 - remembered that I'm blocking my timer so
31:20 - you all can't see it with my hat with my
31:24 - face okay let's see so we want the
31:31 - components and the app bar and I guess
31:36 - we'll want to check that bar with
31:38 - buttons yep so we I mean we don't
31:42 - exactly want a button we want to put
31:43 - icons there but it should be similar
31:48 - there we go I think if we just put an
31:53 - icon button
32:03 - biography
32:08 - yeah let's just try to throw an icon
32:10 - button over there and see what it does
32:18 - so we'll need to bring in let's bring in
32:24 - the icon button first we need the icon
32:31 - button actually we need the the icons as
32:35 - well so we don't we don't want the menu
32:37 - icon and want some other icons
32:50 - but actually we're already pulling that
32:52 - in so I didn't check first and instead
32:57 - of the menu icon
32:58 - I want this there's got to be some type
33:06 - of reference for all the icons so let's
33:12 - see where they talk about the icons
33:31 - let's see if they list the icons
33:47 - okay so I'm guess if I just look them up
33:50 - at the regular materiai Khan's place
33:52 - then the names will be the same so I
33:56 - don't want that
33:57 - what is it came out what it's called
34:05 - what's the what's this called word has
34:09 - the three dots vertical that's what I
34:12 - want
34:13 - let's go
34:23 - I know it has to be in here because you
34:25 - see it on google apps all the time and
34:28 - see
34:40 - the lips all right let me try to type in
34:42 - some of these it's not that
34:58 - I probably have it downloaded somewhere
35:00 - Mike the SVG version already I should
35:05 - just check my downloads folder there we
35:07 - go
35:07 - Wow okay more alright that's what it's
35:10 - called so I'm guessing I can just type
35:14 - more vert and it will work let's try
35:17 - that mmm what's project I've type in
35:28 - more vert icon
35:39 - maybe we'll see maybe it'll work
35:42 - alright so let's grab this should have a
35:49 - icon button and put it in down here
35:58 - where our not there we want the app bar
36:02 - or is there a bar bar
36:08 - okay so we'll win it after no before
36:14 - toolbar yeah we want it before toolbar
36:17 - but after typography so I don't want it
36:22 - to have the class a mini but we'll
36:24 - probably want to put some Styles on it
36:26 - at some point but for now let's take
36:28 - that out and it's not say more for now
36:35 - and more birds so now let's see if that
36:41 - word
36:46 - Hey okay so it kind of worked so we did
36:50 - get we got this in here it works it's
36:52 - just on this side so let's see how they
36:56 - did it here probably they have some type
37:01 - of styling they call this one for the
37:08 - login button
37:21 - I think they used to flex one on this I
37:25 - don't think we're using flex one on that
37:27 - we'll check it out sort of typography
37:38 - flex all right let's check out our theme
37:41 - here and see if we have a flex class if
37:46 - not we'll add it now I don't think we
37:49 - did
37:49 - all right let's add a flex class up here
37:51 - and in our our flex class we just want
37:57 - to say flex one all right so this is
38:00 - it's basically gonna make it take up the
38:06 - take up the space as much space as it as
38:11 - it can in this container and who else
38:16 - actually isn't John Hanson is pretty
38:18 - good about flex box stuff so if he's
38:20 - watching I don't think I've seen him but
38:22 - if he's watching you can correct my my
38:26 - flex box and all this year and oh I
38:30 - didn't I didn't actually add that on to
38:32 - the component so let's do that so down
38:36 - here we're going to add a class name of
38:52 - classes oops that's not we have a what
38:57 - did we call it do we call it classes I
39:01 - guess we did classes flex
39:18 - there we go okay so now we have it over
39:21 - here on the side awesome cool we even
39:23 - got a nice little click effect there
39:26 - great okay so I'm learning a lot more
39:31 - about using flex because I'm doing some
39:34 - react native stuff for my Udacity course
39:37 - and I guess when you're doing react
39:41 - native you have to do everything with
39:42 - flex you can't use like other CSS
39:45 - positioning things and so yeah so that's
39:53 - cool all right so we have that icon here
39:56 - for now I'm cool with this icon we'll
39:58 - probably want to add some more icons
40:01 - let me show it's been a while I think
40:04 - since I've shown what we're what we're
40:06 - trying to upgrade so let me make sure
40:08 - there's nothing so this is like a
40:12 - private site so as long as there's
40:15 - nothing that can't be public here yeah I
40:26 - think we're good so let me show this so
40:29 - right now this is what we're going off
40:31 - of so you can see you know you get we
40:36 - have this week's bulletin up here we
40:38 - have some menu icons so we have
40:40 - different views we have a print view we
40:41 - have a view that's like a grid so it
40:43 - looks more like Pinterest and we can
40:45 - search so we'll have some icons up here
40:48 - a few more icons and then we have our
40:52 - categories here and we also have some
40:54 - filters and we have another another view
40:58 - type down here at classic mode and we'll
41:00 - have we have a submit announcement form
41:04 - so that's what we're gonna end up having
41:07 - in here and so depending on depending on
41:17 - how things go and how much time we have
41:18 - I wouldn't like my times up here we'll
41:21 - do five minutes of question answer but
41:24 - depending on how it goes I would like to
41:27 - maybe give the user some more control
41:30 - over
41:31 - the options of what view do they want to
41:33 - show by default things like that maybe
41:37 - giving the ability to like star certain
41:40 - things or bookmark them and save them
41:42 - for later so they'll have their own
41:43 - section of you know like maybe
41:45 - bookmarked announcements but that does
41:49 - kind of depend on what happens with the
41:50 - single sign-on and and how that all
41:54 - works right now with the way I'm signing
41:56 - users on I could store data and get that
41:58 - for users but since that may change in
42:02 - the near future I'm not really gonna do
42:04 - anything with it right now so let's do a
42:06 - short break
42:07 - check the time okay so we'll see we
42:12 - might not get that much more done
42:13 - actually because I didn't realize my
42:16 - time are you gone off and I I think that
42:18 - went over a lot for that Pomodoro
42:22 - session so yeah we'll see we we might
42:28 - not do another session which is very
42:32 - abnormal usually at least do two but I
42:35 - do want to make sure I can get oops
42:37 - where's my I was trying to get my
42:41 - comments up on my other screen so okay
42:46 - I'm gonna scroll way up to the talks I
42:48 - haven't really gone through the comments
42:49 - very much at all and I'm gonna go down
42:51 - through and try to answer as many
42:52 - questions as I can see
43:09 - okay Jase laces materialise one of the
43:14 - worst web front-end frameworks ever okay
43:21 - it says semantic UI it's one that I've
43:24 - been using heavily lately has a lot of
43:26 - nice API integrations to handle
43:28 - populating forms and such check chicken
43:32 - Jase laces granted I haven't used
43:34 - material on about six months it was
43:36 - really difficult to use properly as a
43:37 - lot of things we're not working this may
43:39 - have changed since okay yeah well I I
43:50 - haven't really used a lot of different
43:52 - UI frameworks for react so we did use
43:55 - the old version of material UI for the
43:57 - last project and this is the latest
43:59 - version so I imagine there is a lot that
44:01 - has changed in the last six months at
44:03 - least with the latest version the old
44:05 - version is probably pretty similar to
44:08 - what it was so I'm very much still
44:11 - learning it I like it because it uses
44:14 - the material design and that's so that
44:17 - helps me out if I'd used if I use
44:19 - another framework I would have to spend
44:21 - more time styling it differently than
44:26 - the default styles to make it look more
44:27 - like the material design style that that
44:29 - we use here at the University for other
44:32 - side projects it wouldn't be a problem
44:34 - but that's why we're going to tear UI
44:38 - now there are a few other material
44:41 - design frameworks out there so I'm open
44:45 - to trying them as well but you know if
44:48 - this works out at some point I'd like to
44:51 - just stick with one and get really good
44:53 - at it right now I'm still kind of in the
44:56 - phase where I'm searching for one that I
44:58 - really like so yeah any suggestions are
45:04 - definitely welcome
45:13 - um Mohammad Reza says hi Jesse this is
45:17 - my first time watching you online hey
45:19 - how's it going thanks so much for
45:21 - watching I'm glad you could catch me
45:23 - live yeah feel free to ask any questions
45:28 - or comment and I'll try to try to answer
45:32 - any questions yet oh cool so Bret Bret
45:43 - says Bret was having a conversation
45:44 - about learning react but I just want to
45:47 - read one of the comments out because
45:49 - it's flattering to me Bret says I was
45:53 - struggling to learn react until I
45:55 - started free code camp and built a site
45:57 - using Jesse's first react project that's
46:01 - really cool I always like whenever
46:03 - you'll let me know that you've used some
46:07 - stuff that we've done on the stream in
46:09 - your own projects I'd love to look at
46:11 - that stuff so if anyone has done
46:13 - anything like that definitely you know
46:16 - send me a link to the github repo or if
46:18 - it's live somewhere online you know
46:21 - definitely like to check it out and I'm
46:23 - really busy lately because of my other
46:25 - course that's going on so I've been
46:27 - slacking on this but I do like to give
46:30 - feedback Lee if you have a project and
46:32 - you want you want me to take a look at
46:34 - it and you tell you what I think I'm
46:37 - definitely down to do that just you know
46:41 - for those of you have done it if I
46:43 - haven't gotten back to you yet I am
46:44 - really sorry I have not forgotten about
46:46 - you but I've just been working a lot you
46:52 - know if I have free time at home to work
46:55 - then I'm working on my my course so that
46:58 - should be over by the end of this month
47:02 - and then I'll have a little bit more
47:06 - time okay
47:11 - all right so my five-minute timer is up
47:14 - for questions and answers yeah I think I
47:17 - think I'm not gonna do another point
47:19 - Medora session I'm just gonna do Q&A cuz
47:21 - I'm scrolling through and I'm not even
47:23 - halfway through the live chat so I don't
47:25 - think there's any way that I could do
47:27 - another session and get through the chat
47:29 - and still be able to look up the date I
47:31 - need for my meeting so yeah so we're
47:34 - just going to do question and answer so
47:37 - I hope to get a little bit more done I
47:38 - kind of got tripped up a little bit at
47:41 - the beginning and and trying to
47:43 - implement this theme but we got it
47:45 - working now and I mean it's in place you
47:47 - could pretty much do whatever you want
47:48 - with the theme now we did get this
47:52 - working which that was easier than I
47:54 - thought so
47:57 - yeah so I guess tomorrow we'll do some
48:00 - more us stuff we'll get the logo and
48:02 - we'll work on maybe some of the
48:03 - different views maybe you get that like
48:06 - grid view layout and get some categories
48:09 - in here so it'll start looking more like
48:12 - it's it's actually going to look and
48:14 - then we can then we can tackle some more
48:17 - than behind the scenes thing like
48:21 - pulling in some more data we're
48:23 - definitely going to need we're gonna
48:26 - need some custom fields and make sure we
48:28 - can pull those and from the graph QL API
48:32 - so and then we're gonna figure out you
48:36 - know how do we display those to the user
48:40 - we're gonna have to hook up a form which
48:42 - we've done before but we're gonna have
48:46 - to do that again which means we're going
48:47 - to need a custom server so we'll do
48:49 - server Jas file so there's a lot of
48:53 - stuff stuff that we have done before but
48:55 - we're doing again and we'll try I always
48:56 - like to try to do it better you know
48:58 - each time so maybe we can try out some
49:00 - new stuff or you know whatever we need
49:04 - to do file uploads so there's definitely
49:07 - some some cool stuff they don't need
49:09 - done and then the big thing at least in
49:11 - my mind because I'm not sure how it's
49:12 - gonna work out is going to be the the
49:17 - login and potentially authentication for
49:20 - our our graph QL API so that'll be fun
49:25 - learn a lot from that and hopefully you
49:27 - all can learn from it or help me learn
49:29 - from it
49:31 - okay so that's the plan coming up I just
49:35 - want to tell you all just so you know
49:37 - like whether it's worth your time to
49:38 - watch or if if you're really good at
49:40 - something like that you know if maybe
49:42 - you'll want to do a pull request or
49:44 - something like that so anyway that's the
49:47 - plan for now let me keep going through
49:50 - the questions in the live chat if you do
49:52 - have a question put it in there now I
49:54 - think I will have time to get through
49:56 - all the questions and if you don't have
50:02 - a question please stick around the and
50:04 - help answer some questions cuz I
50:07 - definitely don't know enough to handle
50:09 - all the questions
50:15 - okay so Blake has a question does graph
50:20 - QL take posts and content from a
50:22 - wordpress site and poured it into the
50:24 - react website okay so Brett responds to
50:33 - this saying it runs queries on the API
50:36 - in this case the WordPress REST API yeah
50:41 - okay so I haven't looked into exactly
50:44 - what the graph QL plug-in that we're
50:45 - using does but it seems so Brett saying
50:48 - that it actually uses the WordPress REST
50:50 - API to get the data initially okay which
50:54 - that's kind of cool
50:56 - and then it then it sends the data so it
51:00 - works just like we were using the REST
51:02 - API in previous projects so we are I
51:09 - mean let me see lakes initial questions
51:12 - answer this correctly
51:18 - okay so I wouldn't say I wouldn't put it
51:21 - like that that graph QL imports them in
51:23 - so you have graph QL basically working
51:26 - on the WordPress side of things so
51:29 - that's your API so before where we were
51:32 - calling the REST API and getting data
51:34 - now we're calling this graph QL API and
51:36 - getting getting data then so we make a
51:42 - call basically using before where we
51:45 - were using fetch now we're using Apollo
51:48 - to make the call I mean I it's it's
51:51 - probably not an exact comparison there
51:53 - but basically it's the serving the same
51:55 - purpose so we're using Apollo to make
51:58 - the call and get the data then once we
52:00 - have it in there Apollo does some stuff
52:02 - behind the scenes with Redux so you
52:05 - basically have the equivalent of a store
52:07 - that's available wherever you need it
52:10 - and that's how we get the data
52:14 - so hopefully that made sense in terms of
52:18 - how how that all those things interact
52:21 - with each other
52:33 - Mohamed's would like to know the best UI
52:38 - websites for making a website trying to
52:45 - see if there are some answers here
52:48 - alright so uh
52:50 - Mohammed it so first of all it depends
52:55 - on whether you're using react or not so
52:58 - if you are using react and I recommend
53:00 - specifically a UI library that works
53:04 - with reacted as react components so if
53:06 - you're in a material design material UI
53:09 - either the original version or the new
53:11 - version one beta will work there are a
53:15 - few other material design libraries for
53:19 - react I haven't had that much experience
53:21 - with them and then there are also some
53:24 - other things I'm pretty sure there's at
53:27 - least one bootstrap library for react so
53:31 - if you're familiar with using bootstrap
53:32 - and other sites I assume it works in a
53:36 - similar way if you're not using react
53:39 - and you're making you know some other
53:41 - type of HTML CSS you know JavaScript
53:44 - site then you could use again if you
53:49 - like material design you could use
53:50 - materialized you could use bootstrap
53:53 - which is very common foundation there's
53:57 - another good one we had a recommendation
53:58 - earlier from Jay slay to use semantic UI
54:04 - so those are just some of my suggestions
54:09 - of things that I've either used myself
54:11 - or I've seen other people use heard good
54:13 - things about so I don't know that
54:17 - there's one that I could say for sure
54:18 - this is the best one because it
54:20 - definitely depends on what what look
54:22 - you're going for with your site right if
54:25 - you really want a material design then I
54:28 - don't recommend using a library that's
54:30 - not material design it could work but
54:32 - you'll spend a lot more time customizing
54:33 - it in the same way if you if you don't
54:38 - want material design look then don't use
54:40 - material eyes or material UI and I
54:43 - noticed a little bit further up by miss
54:46 - Jason Leia says I'm having trouble
54:49 - finding a good use case for react
54:51 - there's a lot of my projects are really
54:52 - small one-off things so I would say if
54:55 - you are trying to learn react then it's
54:59 - worth it to even do small projects that
55:02 - don't necessarily need react because
55:04 - those small simple projects will help
55:06 - you learn react if you're doing a big
55:09 - project that's more complicated there's
55:11 - a lot of other things that aren't even
55:13 - necessarily react things that you'll
55:16 - probably have to figure out and so it'll
55:18 - just add to the difficulty and make it
55:21 - it'll make it harder to learn so I
55:24 - recommend you know do some stuff with
55:27 - reacts it's really small stuff it'll
55:31 - just get you used to doing certain
55:33 - things you know the react way so if you
55:37 - can if you have the freedom to be able
55:39 - to use react for that I know if it's if
55:41 - it's projects for a client or for where
55:43 - you work you don't always have the
55:45 - ability to pick you know what you're
55:47 - going to use but if it's a side project
55:48 - and you can pick then then I definitely
55:53 - recommend doing that and don't worry so
55:55 - much about it's too small you know for
55:58 - react like you're trying to learn it so
56:00 - it's probably better than small mm-hmm
56:05 - sorry yawning again I don't know what
56:08 - this is our last week I just kept
56:10 - yawning during the stream all the time
56:13 - I I got enough sleep I should not be
56:15 - yawning but oh well I hope I'm not
56:20 - making all of you yawn all right let's
56:24 - see
56:37 - and the Resource Center you forgot that
56:39 - yeah
56:40 - I thought we used that for the Resource
56:42 - Center
56:43 - but I wasn't sure if it still worked in
56:45 - the same way for this version and to be
56:50 - honest with you I'm pretty sure it might
56:53 - have been Sebastian that got that
56:54 - working on the resource centers so this
57:00 - is two projects in a row that we've used
57:01 - material UI and I haven't actually set
57:04 - it up myself yet I'm very very grateful
57:08 - for all the help that you give me on
57:11 - here so that probably explains why I am
57:14 - I still had to look everything up
57:16 - because I in fact have never done it
57:19 - even though we used it on the last
57:21 - project the good thing about that though
57:26 - is you set it you set it up once the
57:28 - beginning of the project and then you
57:29 - don't have to set it up again so after
57:32 - that it's much easier to use
57:46 - okay so blake is asking like so Blake
57:52 - asks a question about graph QL saying so
57:55 - Blake said but if I designed a website
57:57 - with HTML react somebody else could
58:00 - write the posts and images and it would
58:02 - automatically add to my website yeah
58:05 - yeah that's exactly how it works yeah so
58:13 - if I were to go into the WordPress
58:17 - actually let me bring this over I'll
58:19 - just demonstrate it so here I am and
58:23 - this is the WordPress installation for
58:28 - this I can go into posts and let's add a
58:32 - new post and let's just say
58:53 - okay does publish that and see how
58:59 - quickly we can get it to show up we
59:02 - might have to refresh Oh we'll see it's
59:05 - already there so somebody could have the
59:08 - login info to get in here and edit these
59:10 - posts and have no access at all to this
59:14 - and they could add data and then it
59:18 - would it would show up here and in fact
59:21 - that's the setup that we're going to
59:22 - have for this once this goes live our
59:25 - someone actually more than one person in
59:29 - my department will have access to this
59:30 - they will be in charge of putting all
59:32 - the content in and then it will display
59:35 - here and at that point I'm really only
59:37 - involved if something goes wrong or if
59:39 - it doesn't show up right so that's
59:45 - actually why I'm using WordPress for the
59:48 - content for this so that someone who
59:50 - doesn't know about the code can edit
59:54 - posts easily okay so Brett's saying we
60:01 - were talking earlier about using react
60:03 - for small projects Brett says the small
60:05 - things are hard to justify using react
60:07 - but Jesse's first project actually uses
60:09 - jQuery a lot and I've been mixing the
60:12 - two a bit getting something to work in
60:13 - jQuery then moving it to react yeah
60:16 - actually I forgot we did do that so we
60:19 - have yes so that first project we build
60:22 - it out as a non reacts it-- first then
60:27 - we converted it to react I forgot that
60:30 - we did that yes so we basically had that
60:32 - we had a back-up plan because initially
60:36 - the deadline was really short and then
60:39 - we ended up being able to launch the
60:41 - site a little bit later which was nice
60:43 - because the site ended up being a lot
60:45 - better you know once we had some more
60:47 - time to work on it but the initial plan
60:49 - was if we couldn't get the react site
60:51 - working then it was faster to just use
60:56 - the just kind of build it out using
61:02 - jQuery and we used materialized CSS so
61:06 - yes that's actually kind of a fun
61:08 - exercise to to take an existing site but
61:10 - with something else and then convert it
61:12 - to react so that that was fun I liked
61:16 - that it was odd now that I go back and
61:18 - look at the code and I see that I'm
61:20 - mixing jQuery with things I think I
61:22 - definitely wouldn't have done it like
61:24 - that now but at the time that that
61:28 - allowed us to get the site up and
61:30 - running as quickly as we did it would
61:35 - definitely took longer than I
61:36 - anticipated but we had a lot of changes
61:38 - that were not anticipated as well so if
61:41 - it would have been based on initially
61:43 - what we're gonna do for the site it
61:45 - definitely could have been done a lot
61:49 - faster
62:00 - Martin asks do you not use semicolons
62:02 - and JavaScript anymore it's it's a
62:07 - choice right so you don't have to so if
62:10 - you want to use semicolons that's
62:13 - totally that's fine some people's really
62:17 - say you should use semicolons but
62:21 - they're pretty much optional there's I
62:23 - think at least one use case where you
62:26 - are supposed to use semicolons because
62:27 - it might mess things up if you don't I
62:29 - can't remember offhand what that use
62:31 - case is I remember looking it up just to
62:35 - make sure and it was a use case that I I
62:36 - don't know that I've ever even come
62:38 - across personally so that's why I don't
62:42 - use semicolons I have like automatic
62:45 - formatting set up with prettier and
62:48 - standard J s and I have it set to remove
62:51 - all semicolons so that's just how I like
62:54 - to do things for me if if you have two
62:57 - pieces of code and one is shorter than
62:58 - the other piece of code but they do the
63:01 - exactly the same thing then I'm going to
63:03 - go with the shorter piece of code you
63:05 - know normally that's that's what I'll go
63:07 - with so removing all the semicolons
63:09 - overall makes less code right so that's
63:13 - why I like it just one less thing to
63:14 - have to type but it's it's it's
63:19 - definitely your choice
63:28 - it's theirs if someone has in the live
63:32 - chat as the handle google sucks I'm just
63:36 - gonna call them Google for right now
63:39 - says this can't be totally free what's
63:42 - the catch
63:44 - what do you mean totally free like free
63:47 - code camp being free or what if it's
63:51 - free code can that yeah it is it's
63:52 - entirely free because like everybody's
63:56 - volunteered so there's a lot of people
64:01 - that contribute their time to make all
64:03 - the different things that free code camp
64:04 - does happen so that's why I can it can
64:09 - be free because of everyone you know
64:11 - everyone making pull requests for things
64:13 - and there's just there's so many people
64:16 - working on things so that's how it's
64:20 - that's how it's free so thanks everybody
64:22 - I who helps out with free code camp
64:26 - there's a lot I mean I I do my little
64:31 - thing here on YouTube but there are so
64:33 - many people who have contributed so much
64:34 - you know for so long so it definitely if
64:40 - you can contribute I definitely consider
64:42 - doing that because that would be awesome
64:46 - and it would keep free code camp going
65:14 - cool Brett says this is great you can
65:17 - have one theme and use it for several
65:18 - projects yeah yeah actually that's
65:20 - that's why when I said earlier like I'd
65:23 - like to just pick one thing and keep
65:24 - using it that's the big benefit of doing
65:26 - that is like let's say I decide I want
65:29 - to keep using this version of material
65:30 - UI I could we could make our theme here
65:34 - set all our colors how we want things to
65:36 - be and then just for our next project we
65:40 - can just copy that over and it will all
65:44 - work and we won't have to do that step
65:46 - again so it would definitely save some
65:48 - time
66:09 - Oh Harshit says by the way I'm only 15
66:13 - years old never worked on a big project
66:14 - well honestly Archie that is I'm super
66:16 - impressed that you're 15 and you're able
66:19 - to do all this so quickly - I mean no
66:22 - like I said earlier check out the pool
66:25 - request number - and everything that
66:27 - Harsha did so much stuff and this was
66:31 - all over the course of I don't know two
66:33 - days maybe three days it seemed it
66:35 - really is really awesome so I'm
66:40 - definitely impressed yeah like keep it
66:43 - up I mean you uh I think you'll be a
66:47 - great programmer if you keep you know
66:51 - keep working at it because you're
66:52 - already awesome
66:58 - and Bret says too harsh it's is Europe
67:02 - you are a confident developer at fifteen
67:04 - just imagine what you'll be doing at
67:05 - thirty hardsuits is up studying science
67:09 - right now at high school physics and
67:11 - math
67:18 - cool yeah that's I don't know how it is
67:22 - where you're at I'm not I don't know
67:24 - where you're located at Harshit but from
67:28 - where I am physics and math were always
67:30 - like the hardest subjects to study in in
67:34 - high school so you must be pretty smart
67:37 - yes so I'm actually I'm really glad that
67:41 - you were contributing my project cuz I
67:43 - think one day down the road you'll
67:46 - probably be doing really awesome things
67:49 - and I'll be able to say like hey I
67:51 - worked on a project with that guy you
67:54 - know back in the day but that's awesome
67:59 - I wish I was more productive when I was
68:04 - 15 I definitely was not doing anything
68:08 - as awesome as contributing open-source
68:14 - react projects and well there YouTube
68:17 - didn't exist when I was 15 so I couldn't
68:20 - couldn't have been on YouTube
68:38 - oh cool it looks like so Robert said
68:41 - that harsh it has some nice YouTube
68:43 - videos on his YouTube channel so I'll
68:46 - have to check those out when I get a
68:48 - chance so yeah definitely if you'd like
68:53 - to see what you're working on
69:20 - kinda 808 says hello everyone hey how's
69:23 - it going thanks for watching
69:41 - see
69:44 - I got some reason my lab chest skipped
69:48 - all the way down to the bottom so now I
69:49 - lost my place here all right I'm left to
69:53 - kind of go quickly through the rest of
69:55 - this because I'm coming up close to my
70:01 - meeting time here okay so it looks like
70:04 - we have somebody in here as the name of
70:06 - someone who's famous so I'm not sure I
70:11 - didn't look it up I'm not gonna look it
70:12 - up just cuz I'm running out of time but
70:15 - may or may not actually be someone
70:17 - famous
70:24 - okay alright so I guess he's the vice
70:36 - president of the Indian opposition not
70:39 - not probably not the guy that's in the
70:41 - channel right now but that does the same
70:43 - name he had definitely not the same guy
70:49 - all right cool well anyway welcome Rahul
70:52 - thanks for watching
71:04 - okay I'm gonna try to pronounce his name
71:07 - I'm apologizing in advance if I get it
71:09 - wrong and a new low wopo and a new low
71:16 - I'm sorry I'm so hopefully you know I'm
71:21 - talking about that says testing
71:24 - components built with material is
71:25 - extremely difficult okay hmm I'll have
71:30 - to have to keep that in mind as anybody
71:32 - else have experience testing material I
71:34 - components I definitely want to use some
71:38 - some type of testing if we can on this
71:41 - project so at this point I'm probably
71:44 - gonna keep going with materiai but I
71:46 - would like to know if anybody is has
71:48 - experience successfully testing things
71:55 - let's see no beer says Jessie where do
72:01 - you host your website dot IO domain
72:05 - that's what I'm talking about
72:07 - I do I have a dot IO
72:16 - I don't know it's just I don't know
72:18 - which website any toilet so my my
72:24 - personal website against this
72:26 - professional website is Jesse Weibull
72:29 - calm I don't currently have an IO
72:33 - actually be cool to have an IO maybe I
72:38 - should get one world's asked do most UI
72:46 - frameworks work with react you can make
72:50 - them work with reacts but the ones that
72:53 - actually have react components I think
72:55 - are better so I try to deal with those
73:00 - I've made materialized CSS is not a
73:04 - react framework but I did make it work
73:06 - in project one you just have to be
73:08 - careful with some of the jQuery stuff
73:11 - you you don't you really want to try not
73:15 - to manipulate the Dom because it messes
73:17 - with with what react does so it can work
73:21 - but it's not ideal but if you do want to
73:25 - make it work check out project one on
73:29 - this YouTube channel and on the live
73:32 - it'll be on the live coding with Jesse
73:34 - playlist yeah so check out the first
73:37 - project that we did and I mean that's an
73:40 - example of getting a non reacting work
73:42 - to work with with react
73:56 - Hamza says was was it the first project
73:59 - when you set up lint stage and prettier
74:01 - or the second um I don't know let's just
74:07 - check
74:09 - oops I meant to take github
74:12 - [Music]
74:22 - no no that's not it I once see I reacts
74:25 - nuts yes static there we go yeah yeah
74:33 - for the first project that's we did have
74:36 - lint stage and fruitier setup on that
74:38 - one no beer says I heard that react plus
74:44 - Redux equals powerful yeah yeah
74:48 - definitely
74:49 - we were actually gonna use Redux for
74:51 - this project but then realized that we
74:53 - didn't have to use Redux and that's what
74:55 - Harshit had removed Redux and replaced
74:57 - it with all the Apollo stuff but we'll
74:59 - probably end up using Redux at some
75:01 - point for another project so I just used
75:05 - it for another project that I did for
75:09 - that Udacity course and it is really
75:13 - cool it was a little bit difficult to
75:15 - you know figure it all out at first but
75:17 - once I got the hang of it
75:19 - I could definitely see like how useful
75:21 - it is harsh it's asks about a link for
75:26 - the slack Channel
75:28 - I don't currently have a link for the
75:30 - slack Channel that works there's a
75:31 - workaround that I need to work on I just
75:34 - haven't had time to get a setup yet so
75:36 - if I guess for now if you really want to
75:39 - get in the slack channel before I get
75:40 - the workaround set up send me a message
75:42 - on Twitter with your email and I can
75:44 - send you a an invite to your email I
75:50 - don't know if I could get you the invite
75:53 - today cuz I'm gonna be pretty busy the
75:55 - rest of the day but probably tomorrow
76:05 - okay Arshad says there's also been some
76:07 - changes made in the graph QL folder with
76:11 - fragments so yeah I'm betting animals
76:13 - time visit all right I'm gonna have to
76:15 - check that out later okay but I'm gonna
76:19 - leave this open so I don't forget to
76:20 - look at it I'm just going to check I'm
76:27 - not gonna read all the comments cuz run
76:29 - out of time here but I'm gonna check for
76:31 - questions so if I don't read your
76:32 - comment I'm sorry just running out of at
76:35 - a time here
76:47 - Oh actually I'm going to read this this
76:50 - sounds useful Brett says you can make
76:51 - you material UI theme a separate get
76:53 - repo and imported for each project that
76:56 - sounds but that sounds really good I
76:59 - love that idea
77:13 - Robert says have you used material UI
77:15 - with routing in a react project that's
77:17 - the point regular stuck yeah so we have
77:19 - used react router with material UI the
77:23 - the last project that we did well I
77:26 - guess not the last one project to so
77:29 - project 2 is the the Resource Center we
77:32 - use material I and react router we add
77:36 - some routing going on there so check
77:39 - that out maybe hopefully that can help
77:43 - and if you have any questions let me
77:45 - know
77:57 - okay so the name before that I have
78:00 - trouble pronouncing he says you can call
78:02 - me I know so
78:04 - all right I'll I'll try remember to call
78:07 - you a new and start really sorry about
78:10 - that I do try to pronounce everyone's
78:16 - name properly if at all possible
78:30 - oh okay so earlier nobody was asking
78:33 - about the dot IO site and that's the N
78:35 - grog site so that's a it's it's the
78:40 - thing you run I'm running it on my
78:42 - computer it basically takes whatever I'm
78:44 - running with on localhost and it
78:46 - converts it into a live URL that people
78:50 - can go to to check it out so normally
78:53 - you can't have this many people on and
78:55 - rock looking like by default from the
78:59 - free plan but the guy that's that runs
79:03 - and grukk he is letting us use it for
79:10 - free for free code camp stream so very
79:13 - generous very generous of him so anyway
79:15 - that's why you know you all can see that
79:18 - so it's not like my site personally it's
79:20 - through and grow
79:34 - all right so one more question and then
79:37 - I have to go I'm getting some slack
79:39 - messages from my boss so Angela says
79:43 - have you tried to test material I
79:45 - component a fool Dom with just an enzyme
79:56 - okay what did we do on the we had some
80:01 - testing going on with material UI on
80:04 - project 2 so I mean if you want to check
80:07 - out some of the videos from project to
80:09 - the or even check out the repo for
80:12 - project 2 that was the the Resource
80:16 - Center we did have we usually materiai
80:19 - we did have some testing going on so
80:22 - maybe that'll have something useful for
80:27 - you on there but alright so at this
80:30 - point I definitely have to go thanks so
80:34 - much for all your help and for all the
80:37 - contributions here in the live chat I
80:39 - will be back tomorrow and until then
80:42 - have a great day
