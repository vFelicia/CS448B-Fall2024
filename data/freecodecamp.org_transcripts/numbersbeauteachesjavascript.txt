00:00 - this is a quick video about the basics
00:02 - of working with numbers in javascript i
00:05 - have it set up to log this number to the
00:07 - console so we'll see it appear over here
00:09 - and the numbers up here the number
00:10 - equals 12.
00:12 - you can do all the standard operations
00:14 - in javascript so i can do plus
00:18 - 2
00:22 - 14 i can do
00:24 - minus
00:25 - 2
00:27 - 10 i can do
00:29 - multiplication with the asterisk
00:33 - yup 24 like you can do division with the
00:37 - slash
00:39 - 6
00:41 - and you can even
00:43 - divide
00:44 - and get a decimal answer
00:47 - also
00:49 - there's the modulus operator that gives
00:52 - you the remainder so 12 the modulus 7
00:56 - we're going to get a remainder of five
00:58 - it would really be one remainder five
01:00 - seven goes into twelve one time with a
01:02 - remainder of five
01:04 - and you can do all of these operations
01:07 - with decimals so i can do seven point
01:10 - three
01:13 - we can multiply by decimals
01:19 - and you can divide with decimals
01:25 - and one thing to notice is that all
01:27 - numbers are eventually rounded off so
01:29 - it's not going to go on forever so that
01:32 - could affect accuracy in some programs
01:35 - okay if you just want to add one to a
01:37 - number you can do plus plus at the end
01:40 - that is going to increment the number
01:42 - one so it started at 12 and now we're at
01:45 - 13.
01:46 - and you can also put minus minus to
01:49 - decrement the number it's gonna now go
01:52 - down one a lot of times in programming
01:55 - you want to do something like this
01:56 - number equals number
01:59 - plus
02:00 - five
02:02 - and there's a quick way to do that
02:05 - you can do it like this
02:07 - plus equals so whenever you see this
02:10 - number plus equals five that's the same
02:13 - as number equals number plus five you
02:16 - can also do that with multiplication
02:18 - that's number equals number times
02:21 - 60 when the number is 12 you can do with
02:23 - division you can do it with subtraction
02:26 - and then i just wanted to show you one
02:29 - last thing with the numbers plus plus
02:33 - and you can see that it's going to show
02:36 - 12
02:37 - but if we do console.log
02:40 - number again
02:43 - so it's going to console.log the number
02:46 - then it's going to increment after it
02:48 - logs it so then when you log it again
02:49 - it's 13. however if i take this plus
02:53 - plus and put that at the beginning of
02:56 - the the number let me clear the console
02:58 - and run that again it's going to
03:00 - increment the number and then log the
03:03 - number so if you have the plus plus or
03:05 - the minus minus before the number it
03:07 - does that before doing what i was just
03:09 - about to do with the number which was
03:10 - logging it but if you put the plus plus
03:12 - or minus minus after the number first it
03:14 - does what i was going to do which is
03:15 - logging it and then increments or
03:17 - decrements the number
03:19 - well those are numbers thanks for
03:20 - watching my name is beau carnes don't
03:22 - forget to subscribe and remember use
03:24 - your code for good
