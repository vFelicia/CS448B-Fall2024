00:05 - hey everybody its Jesse and I haven't
00:10 - haven't streamed in a while had a
00:13 - holiday yesterday fourth of July here in
00:16 - the US and the day before that my boss
00:18 - got married so I took the day off and
00:20 - went to his wedding so it's been since
00:24 - last week we we did some really some
00:31 - like design work on it was a Friday we
00:35 - had at the last dream and actually let
00:39 - me show you let me show you what I kind
00:42 - of settled on for the moment just to let
00:46 - you know how it went so if you remember
00:50 - we were going with like a really short
00:53 - section and at the very end of the
00:55 - stream it was a long stream so I don't
00:58 - know how many people stuck around for
00:59 - the end but at the very end someone
01:01 - mentioned that it looks like an
01:04 - old-school WordPress header and then I
01:08 - made up my mind that I had to change it
01:10 - because I couldn't have that so I left
01:13 - it a little bit bigger than normal and
01:15 - kept a lot of the same I kept it
01:18 - basically same as it originally was
01:20 - shrunk it a little bit adjusted line
01:23 - Heights and made this a bit bigger made
01:27 - the font a bit bigger increase the font
01:29 - weight so all the changes are are much
01:33 - more minor than what we had originally
01:35 - done on Friday so this is what I'm going
01:38 - with for now of course I'll have to see
01:40 - what everyone else that's involved in
01:42 - the project thinks about that but that's
01:45 - it for now the only other changes I made
01:48 - since Friday are I took out this there
01:51 - was a contact form section here I took
01:54 - that out I got an email this morning
01:57 - saying that they didn't want that in
01:59 - there and there's some other sections
02:01 - and they're gonna be taken out and
02:02 - rearranged here but other than that the
02:05 - home page is pretty much finished I
02:07 - think I think I'm going to get different
02:09 - images for these sections and that's
02:11 - I'll just see whatever images I'm giving
02:13 - for that and hopefully they all can can
02:16 - work with these dimensions but today
02:19 - we're gonna work on the resource section
02:23 - specifically we're gonna work on sorting
02:27 - so we might do a little bit of UI work
02:29 - here because we're gonna need to add
02:30 - some toggles and a drop-down maybe but
02:33 - the most important thing is getting the
02:35 - sorting to work so that users can pick a
02:40 - category they can toggle whether they
02:42 - want the free or the paid resources you
02:45 - know this obviously already works and
02:46 - then they could even search within that
02:49 - so they can just really narrow down on
02:51 - what they exactly what they want
02:54 - so I'm streaming from home again so if
02:59 - you've joined in before when I've
03:00 - streamed from home the quality isn't
03:04 - always great but I had to work from home
03:07 - again today so let me know if if
03:09 - anything is is really really off the
03:13 - setting I left the same settings as out
03:15 - on Friday and it seemed ok on Friday the
03:17 - video quality is not HD which that kind
03:21 - of stinks I would rather it be HD but at
03:23 - least the the buffering wasn't too bad
03:26 - on Friday but let me know if it gets bad
03:28 - there's not really that much I can do
03:30 - about it but maybe I can change some
03:33 - settings here I'm gonna go to the live
03:36 - chat as quickly and say hello before we
03:39 - get started sorry I had I don't have
03:44 - anything set up as much as I normally do
03:46 - I just concluded a an interview a phone
03:51 - interview with with a candidate so that
03:55 - ended just a few minutes before the
03:56 - stream hey everyone oh hey hey bill bill
04:03 - hasn't been able catch a stream in a
04:05 - while so I'm glad you could watch this
04:06 - one
04:11 - hey Fabian how's it going yeah I haven't
04:15 - seen you in the stream for a while it's
04:17 - good to see you yeah
04:22 - the github sue rev asks about the
04:27 - github link so the link for the github
04:30 - repo for this project is in the
04:33 - description there's not exactly a
04:37 - tutorial to follow but if you check the
04:40 - videos I actually started this website I
04:43 - think on my own channel so I think
04:46 - there's like two streams that are on my
04:48 - youtube channel and that's linked in the
04:50 - description and then I got invited to
04:52 - stream for free code camp so I've
04:54 - switched everything over to them so it's
04:58 - a lot of content some of the streams are
05:00 - pretty long but if you went through them
05:04 - it would be somewhat of a tutorial but
05:07 - not not comprehensive at all the goal of
05:09 - this show in case you're joining for the
05:11 - first time is just to to work watch me
05:15 - work with me
05:16 - as I do my normal everyday thing so
05:19 - there's a lot of things that I work on
05:21 - for this project that I don't record so
05:24 - that's why you won't get exactly you
05:26 - know comprehensive tutorial but I try to
05:30 - title all the videos accurately in terms
05:32 - of what I'm doing so you know there are
05:35 - some aspects of what we're doing that
05:38 - are tutorial like and you you probably
05:41 - get a good idea of how to do it but no
05:45 - not really any official tutorials yet
05:52 - yeah it is someone asked about the
05:55 - resolution it's 480p right now that's
05:58 - basically my upload right now is below 5
06:03 - megabits per second so I can't
06:05 - consistently stream at a high enough
06:08 - bitrate to get 720p so I dropped it down
06:10 - to 480 because if I try to do 720 I
06:13 - can't sustain it and there's lots of
06:15 - buffering or ATP seems to be the max I
06:18 - can get on my home network so yeah I
06:22 - know a couple people are saying they
06:25 - don't like the 4 TPI I watched the
06:28 - recording the last video and I really
06:30 - couldn't stand the 480 but I figure I
06:32 - guess it's better to just you know do a
06:34 - stream than to not do one because I
06:37 - don't know when I'm gonna be able to get
06:38 - back into
06:40 - into the office so I might be doing a
06:42 - bunch of streams from home huh I don't
06:44 - want to be away from you all for that
06:47 - long of a period of time I don't know
06:50 - about you but I like have gotten used to
06:53 - interacting with you all you know four
06:57 - sometimes five times a week and I start
07:00 - to miss you when when I don't stream for
07:02 - a while so I thought it would be good to
07:05 - just do the the stream and all right so
07:10 - we have it looks like yeah we have a
07:14 - really good amount of viewers today
07:15 - actually more than normal so we're up to
07:18 - you know over 90 viewers so that's great
07:21 - so I don't want to leave everyone
07:22 - hanging with introductions let's get to
07:25 - it just to explain in case you haven't
07:28 - seen what we're doing here we're pulling
07:31 - in these are resources this sections
07:33 - gonna undergo a big kind of design
07:36 - update here not on this video but it
07:39 - will soon probably sometime this week so
07:43 - what we're gonna do or what we are doing
07:45 - is we're pulling in data JSON data from
07:49 - WordPress via the WordPress API so all
07:53 - these resources are added in by someone
07:56 - else who handles the content into the
07:58 - WordPress back-end we pull it in here to
08:00 - this site which is a react site so
08:04 - that's what we're going to be sorting
08:05 - through we're gonna get in JSON data and
08:08 - then we're gonna be adding in filters
08:12 - and we're gonna include some sorting I
08:15 - don't have anything in the UI right now
08:17 - that really like would would sort things
08:20 - so we're gonna have to add some elements
08:22 - in for that as well but we want to be
08:28 - able to filter that data by categories
08:31 - so there'll be a drop-down with a bunch
08:33 - of categories we want to be able to
08:35 - filter whether it's free a free resource
08:37 - or paid resource and there'll be a
08:39 - toggle for that the search is already
08:42 - working these already work but we may
08:45 - change exactly how these interacts so
08:49 - we'll see once we get into it whether we
08:51 - need to change
08:53 - so that's the plan and I'm not gonna
08:58 - worry as much about the UI yet in the
09:00 - design yet because I think that the
09:02 - sorting and filtering is the most
09:03 - important part and if I get that down
09:06 - and you get it working you know then I
09:08 - can fine-tune the design aspects of it
09:11 - later on so right now I was working I
09:16 - think I'm gonna switch to another branch
09:19 - so if you're following along on github
09:22 - let me pull this over just really
09:24 - quickly and show you what we're working
09:26 - on
09:29 - what branch were working on I'll make
09:31 - this bigger I'm have to make everything
09:34 - extra big I think - just to make up for
09:37 - the low res video so everything that we
09:44 - did on Friday and that I've done since
09:46 - then is on the home alt branch so if
09:49 - you're checking on github that's the you
09:51 - need to switch to that branch to see it
09:53 - for these resources actually I think I'm
09:56 - gonna make a new branch for this and if
10:01 - you're not familiar with git or github a
10:03 - branch is just like an alternate version
10:05 - of your your project and you can switch
10:10 - to that branch make any changes you want
10:12 - and then switch back to the original
10:13 - branch and everything's still in the
10:15 - same condition you left it so it's nice
10:17 - to be able to make you add new features
10:20 - and if you need to switch back to the
10:22 - main branch and make a quick fix on
10:25 - something that came up you can do that
10:27 - and then you'll push that up to
10:30 - production that can be live and then you
10:32 - can just switch right back to your
10:34 - feature branch and work on that until
10:36 - it's ready to go so it's super useful
10:41 - I've gone in some previous videos in
10:44 - more depth into and to get but I haven't
10:48 - done a tutorial yet I hope to do so soon
10:50 - but there are a lot of great get
10:52 - tutorials out there even on this channel
10:53 - in free code camp there's a whole
10:55 - playlist about using get in and github
10:58 - so if you want to learn more about it I
11:00 - recommend checking that out so let's I
11:04 - I'm just going to check
11:07 - just to make sure I don't have anything
11:08 - okay so this branch is clean I'm just
11:16 - gonna push it up to github just so that
11:18 - I have it in case I need to work from a
11:20 - different computer and so that you all
11:23 - can see all the changes as well and
11:25 - let's change I think I'm going to name
11:30 - this branch resource sorting I guess
11:35 - that works so we're gonna git git branch
11:41 - it's is this easy if you haven't done
11:43 - this before and get github or with git I
11:45 - mean it's it's super easy just get
11:47 - branch and then type the name of the
11:49 - branch that you want to create and
11:51 - actually I'm gonna let me go I'm gonna
11:59 - go back to the master branch first I'm
12:05 - not really sure I'm sure you know you
12:07 - all probably know this but I didn't want
12:10 - to get a copy of the home old branch and
12:14 - start from that I wanted to start from
12:15 - master so I didn't know if that would
12:17 - make a difference just the web branch I
12:19 - was in but just in case I do want to
12:21 - make a copy of the master branch to
12:24 - start with this so I don't know we're
12:32 - gonna be doing more than sorting but
12:34 - this will be a decent name out at least
12:35 - I'll be able to remember it so now if we
12:38 - go get branch it'll list all our
12:41 - branches so we have resource sorting so
12:47 - now we can go to that so we get checkout
12:49 - and there are shortcuts for like pretty
12:52 - much every command you want to do and
12:53 - get so you don't always have to type all
12:55 - this out there we go now we're on our
13:02 - own branch so now I can do anything on
13:04 - this branch and it won't mess up
13:05 - anything else you're doing on any other
13:06 - branches all right so let's go over to
13:09 - our code and we'll go into resources let
13:14 - me make this a bit bigger okay let me
13:17 - know if it needs to be bigger than that
13:20 - I'll show you what's going on just in
13:25 - case you haven't seen any of the videos
13:27 - where we worked on this I mean we're in
13:30 - porting just some basic layout
13:31 - components our resources are all in
13:35 - cards and that's a separate component
13:37 - but this is this is gonna undergo a
13:38 - major change so we're ly gonna leave it
13:41 - for now but that will definitely change
13:46 - we're importing we've we've extracted
13:54 - and not me actually I think you did it I
13:58 - think it was Patrick who submitted a
14:00 - pull request that took that all of our
14:04 - our fetch our functions that we're using
14:07 - to fetch data and put it into its own
14:10 - component so that's out of here it
14:12 - cleans things up a little bit and we
14:14 - don't have to include the same things in
14:15 - every every page so that's nice and then
14:20 - we had gotten masonry working before
14:22 - this is kind of sad for me because if
14:24 - you remember that was a really kind of a
14:27 - long stream when we tried to get masonry
14:29 - working and now I don't even think I'm
14:32 - gonna need it for the page so sad about
14:36 - that but I will definitely be using it
14:38 - in future sites so it will not be a
14:40 - waste of of effort alright so basically
14:44 - all we're doing is you know we've we've
14:47 - set up our state we have a place for our
14:48 - data to live here in our state and we
14:52 - get our initial request here and this is
14:56 - we're using next js' to kind of scaffold
14:59 - out or react up and in XJS if you want
15:02 - to render on the cert if you want to
15:04 - make the API call on a server side to be
15:07 - able to render that into the HTML and
15:10 - then send it to the client on that first
15:13 - load you have to do it inside get
15:15 - initial props and of course that saves
15:17 - it the prop so we have to transfer that
15:19 - then to the state so that's all we're
15:23 - doing here so this thing here is just
15:25 - fetching the data and it does it
15:28 - isomorphic lis so this would actually
15:30 - take care of fetching it on the
15:32 - server-side and then if they were if you
15:35 - went there we're using client-side
15:37 - routing so if they navigated to this
15:40 - page using the client-side routing then
15:42 - it would also work as well so we're just
15:46 - transferring that from props to state
15:49 - and we want to transfer that to state
15:51 - because we want reacts to be able to
15:53 - rerender every time the state changes
15:55 - and that's going to be key for our
15:57 - sorting because every time we sort or
15:59 - filter anything all we're gonna do is
16:01 - change how these things are set up in
16:05 - state and then react is automatically
16:07 - gonna know and I know most of you know
16:10 - this already but just in case there's
16:11 - some people that aren't familiar with
16:12 - react I'm kind of going through it react
16:15 - is gonna know about the change and it's
16:18 - gonna rerender everything okay so that's
16:21 - great if you've done anything like with
16:23 - trying to setup maybe like a single page
16:27 - app with jQuery or something you know
16:29 - it's crazy to have all these event
16:30 - listeners and everything so we don't
16:32 - even worry about that everything is nice
16:34 - and contained in State react takes care
16:37 - of so much of that so here's where we
16:42 - actually get to some of the stuff you
16:44 - know we're already doing some actually
16:49 - saw in this page I was thinking we were
16:51 - doing some filtering on this page but it
16:53 - it was on the events page so that's
16:56 - where you viewed on it so we may
16:57 - actually just copy some code from the
16:59 - events page as well and I'll bring that
17:04 - up right now cuz we're definitely gonna
17:05 - want to copy some stuff from that page
17:09 - so here's what we're doing so we bring
17:13 - in our data and we can set filters on
17:16 - the data right away and that's key you
17:19 - want to filter before you do sorting or
17:22 - mapping or anything because then you'll
17:24 - have a smaller set of data for
17:26 - everything to have to be put through
17:28 - after that so in this case we right away
17:32 - just filter out any events that have
17:34 - already happened that had a date
17:36 - previous to today's date and then after
17:40 - that we can
17:44 - we mapped the events into you know
17:47 - basically acts components hey and I'm
17:50 - not doing any sorting here oh yeah I am
17:54 - I didn't remember this because somebody
17:57 - else actually did this as well I think
18:00 - it was Patrick as well if I'm giving
18:02 - credit to the wrong person let me know
18:03 - but I thought it was Patrick that
18:05 - submitted this pull request where is
18:07 - actually using a sort for our sorting by
18:13 - distance okay so that's our basic things
18:18 - that we're going to use here mainly
18:19 - filter and sort and then when we're all
18:21 - filtered and sorted out sorted how we
18:23 - want it then we use map to just iterate
18:27 - over all those things and put them into
18:29 - you know the components that we need to
18:31 - get them rendered on the page and then
18:33 - everything is going to be set into state
18:36 - to trigger the rerender all right so I'm
18:40 - gonna go back to if I lost you in a live
18:43 - chatter you have any questions throw
18:44 - them in there right now I'll check it
18:46 - very quickly before we start actually
18:49 - coding stuff I just don't want to lose
18:52 - anybody you know this early on
18:56 - okay great it looks like okay it looks
19:01 - like the video is decent some people are
19:04 - saying they can read it it's decent
19:05 - quality um Ahmed says it it's kind of
19:15 - cute that I said I don't want to be away
19:17 - from you officer I know it's true I've
19:20 - been pleasantly surprised at the
19:22 - community that's kind of been built up
19:24 - around this I really feel like I always
19:29 - did my work alone I was a freelancer I
19:32 - basically worked alone from my house and
19:34 - now where I work I'm basically alone in
19:37 - what I do there's one other guy that
19:38 - does some web related like web
19:40 - development stuff but we always work on
19:42 - different projects so I'm just kind of
19:43 - alone in my office most of the time I
19:46 - mean there are days when I come in early
19:48 - I don't see anybody and I don't see
19:50 - anybody all day
19:51 - I'll come out of the office to go home
19:53 - later on and my co-workers will say oh I
19:55 - didn't even know you're here how so
19:58 - it's really really cool and unique for
19:59 - me to have this whole community of
20:01 - people and we're all like working
20:03 - together you know on these projects so
20:07 - it's been amazing I I didn't think
20:09 - anybody would even be interested in this
20:11 - when I started doing it so this has all
20:13 - been a very wonderful surprise for me so
20:16 - anyway enough of the sappy stuff I just
20:20 - I do appreciate you all so thank you
20:25 - hello a lot of people saying hello hey
20:27 - everyone
20:31 - okay bill says I like to use get check
20:34 - out - be this with the flag bee and then
20:39 - branch name to create a new branch and
20:41 - immediately check it out so I don't
20:42 - accidentally start working on my master
20:44 - branch that's a great idea so I'm just
20:48 - gonna throw this this command up just so
20:50 - that everyone can see it even if you
20:53 - can't see the live chat now or if you're
20:54 - watching later on I'm gonna throw this
20:57 - command up here so bill saying if you do
21:00 - check out so beta it would be get check
21:02 - out which I didn't I didn't copy the
21:08 - guid part so if you type git checkout
21:10 - and then you have this flag be and then
21:13 - type your branch name you'll
21:15 - automatically move to that branch and
21:19 - that bill says you don't accidentally
21:21 - start working on master branch so
21:23 - awesome I'm gonna try to remember that
21:26 - for myself as well cuz I can see that
21:28 - being really really useful so thank you
21:33 - for that okay
21:39 - someone says they wanted just a little
21:40 - bit bigger so let's go up I'll go up a
21:43 - little bit more I think if I go too big
21:46 - I think it's just gonna be hard to see
21:48 - enough of the code to really know what's
21:49 - going on so if you really need it to be
21:53 - bigger let me know I can try to go
21:54 - bigger but I think we're getting to the
21:56 - point now where it's kind of at our
21:58 - limit of what's reasonable
22:04 - nantan has a question how come you're
22:06 - using WordPress as a database instead a
22:08 - MongoDB bill bill has
22:11 - a good answer to that and I'll just give
22:14 - a just a brief answer in case you can't
22:16 - see the live chat WordPress is very easy
22:21 - for people who don't know how to code to
22:23 - edit things in WordPress so WordPress is
22:26 - my content management system because
22:28 - there's going to be different people a
22:30 - lot of like student workers that are
22:31 - gonna be entering data and they're gonna
22:33 - have varying levels of experience with
22:35 - just websites in general at all so I
22:38 - needed it to be as user friendly as
22:40 - possible as simple as possible and I
22:42 - know that WordPress is very simple to to
22:47 - use so that's why I went with WordPress
22:51 - I I would like at some point to be able
22:55 - to find an alternative that's just as
22:57 - easy to use that I could use instead of
23:00 - WordPress because WordPress can be
23:01 - resource heavy at times I'd love to be
23:04 - able to find something that's written in
23:05 - with with node instead of PHP and then I
23:09 - just wouldn't have to worry about PHP at
23:11 - all but until that time WordPress is my
23:14 - go-to for content management systems if
23:16 - I need it
23:18 - even just to pull data into a react site
23:21 - or an app or something I still think
23:24 - it's one of the most user-friendly
23:26 - options available and it's stable
23:28 - there's a huge community there's
23:30 - constantly security releases coming out
23:32 - so I can be confident that it's gonna
23:36 - work you know and it's it's gonna be
23:38 - pretty reliable so that's why I've been
23:41 - using WordPress Bill asks about Keystone
23:45 - j/s if anyone's used it I actually I've
23:48 - tried Keystone but I tried it I tried a
23:50 - bunch of new CMS's all at the same time
23:52 - so I can't even remember exactly what
23:55 - was unique about Keystone but I'll have
23:57 - to try it out again ok so it seems as if
24:04 - the code is okay to read but the folders
24:07 - are small yeah
24:08 - there's no at least to my knowledge I'm
24:11 - using Adam as my editor there's no easy
24:13 - shortcut way for me to make this text
24:15 - bigger I can make this text bigger just
24:17 - with a simple like command plus but it
24:20 - doesn't work when I try to do it over
24:22 - here so for now
24:25 - the folders are as they are if if
24:28 - there's something over here that I
24:29 - really think you should see maybe I can
24:32 - try to zoom in or I'll just read it out
24:34 - but for now the folders will be pretty
24:39 - hard to read okay so it looks like I've
24:44 - gotten through any questions than
24:45 - anybody had okay one more question is
24:49 - popped up so Andrea asks are you
24:51 - blocking your WordPress front end from
24:54 - visitors somehow and the answer is not
24:58 - yet
24:59 - so I think I mentioned a long time ago
25:02 - that the intention I had was to block
25:04 - people from going to the WordPress site
25:05 - which I normally do when I have a setup
25:07 - like this but I've been so busy with
25:10 - other things with the site I haven't
25:11 - done it yet
25:12 - part of the reason is I don't think it's
25:15 - on a subdomain and most people won't go
25:18 - to it the only thing I would be worried
25:20 - about potentially is I don't want that
25:22 - to get indexed by search engines ever
25:24 - there's no links to it anywhere so the
25:27 - odds of that happening you're probably
25:29 - low but still I am going to block it and
25:33 - basically the the easiest way that I've
25:36 - found to block it is to just go into
25:38 - your templates your wordpress templates
25:41 - and just take everything out because
25:45 - that's what renders everything it would
25:47 - be like you know going into react and
25:50 - just taking this index you know it's is
25:54 - basically as simple as find the
25:56 - equivalent of index J s for WordPress
25:59 - which would it be a PHP file and just
26:01 - pull everything out just like literally
26:07 - delete everything from that file save it
26:09 - and then when a user tries to go that
26:11 - site they'll see a blank screen I have
26:14 - done in the past on test sites instead
26:18 - of removing everything and leaving it
26:20 - I've removed everything and then added a
26:22 - full screen YouTube embed of the Rick
26:27 - Astley song so I rickroll everybody that
26:31 - tries to get to my site but I can't do
26:33 - that on official University websites so
26:38 - but if you ever find one of my test
26:41 - WordPress installations then you may see
26:42 - that yeah someone asked about the
26:50 - quality again I'm really sorry about the
26:52 - quality I wish I have the best internet
26:56 - I can possibly buy right now my at my
26:58 - house and it's it's still not great so I
27:05 - hope I can get better one day but it's
27:08 - just I'm limited to this right now so
27:11 - let's get to let's just pick what we
27:14 - want to do at first I think the easiest
27:17 - thing to do right now will probably be
27:20 - the toggle for whether the resources
27:24 - free or paid that way we don't have to
27:27 - come up with any like pretend category
27:29 - names or anything like that we'll just I
27:33 - already have data in the JSON file that
27:36 - tells me whether it's free or paid but
27:38 - I'm currently not pulling in the names
27:40 - of categories so to save us from having
27:43 - to go in and and make all this you know
27:46 - fake data just to get this to work we'll
27:49 - go with the toggle at first so I'm gonna
27:52 - pull up we have been using materialized
28:01 - so we're using material design and we're
28:06 - kind of basing everything off of that
28:07 - but in particular we're using the
28:08 - materialized framework to trying to help
28:10 - get a jumpstart on all of our UI stuff
28:14 - so we're gonna grab the the code for a
28:20 - toggle let's see there we go
28:30 - switches I guess they're calling them
28:33 - switches here I was wrong on the toggle
28:34 - so basically I want something like this
28:35 - but instead of on/off it's gonna say
28:38 - free and paid obviously will have a
28:42 - different color as well but that's
28:43 - basically it this is what we need so
28:46 - really simple we'll just copy that
28:51 - and we'll put that into our page let's
29:00 - see this is where I want to find where
29:03 - we have the search bar because I want it
29:05 - right to the left of the search bar well
29:11 - that's so this is higher up in the page
29:12 - [Music]
29:18 - this is the middle section here we go
29:23 - this file this react component is
29:27 - getting a lot bigger than I normally
29:29 - like components to be so it may need to
29:32 - to be cut down and broken up a bit and
29:36 - other components but for now we'll work
29:38 - with it as is all right so here's our
29:40 - tabs so above that is our search input
29:44 - and right now we can just use the
29:50 - regular column classes to align this so
29:54 - this input field is taking up half of
29:58 - the screen and we're offsetting it by
30:01 - half so on a medium screen it takes up
30:04 - six out of twelve columns and we've
30:07 - offset it by six columns and that's how
30:09 - we got it to be aligned to the right
30:11 - instead of you know normally it would be
30:14 - aligned left by default
30:15 - so we're gonna want to align now
30:20 - actually there's a plug-in now the where
30:23 - I don't even have to type class names so
30:25 - this will work but normally without that
30:27 - that plug-in you have to type in class
30:32 - name instead of class if you're you're
30:35 - using JSX
30:37 - so I'm gonna do class call alone and
30:42 - we're going to do I think we can get
30:46 - away with an s2 is this is gonna be a
30:48 - small input or I'm sorry and I'm not
30:54 - gonna worry about the small screens yet
30:56 - it probably doesn't warrant having it's
30:58 - an entire row on its own but maybe but
31:01 - for now we'll just have have the whole
31:03 - full width on small
31:05 - on medium screens we're gonna make it
31:07 - too and then we want to offset this by
31:13 - four that's all we really have left
31:16 - right so we had six this is gonna take
31:19 - up two so we only have four left so
31:21 - we're gonna offset that before so and
31:24 - this is this column system is all from
31:27 - the materialised framework so we're just
31:30 - following that I haven't customized it
31:32 - in any way so within that is where we
31:37 - can put our our switch now the nice
31:40 - thing about having the the plugin and
31:43 - once again this was something that I
31:44 - didn't do myself someone else did on a
31:47 - pull request and now I'm starting I've
31:49 - had so many of you help on this I'm
31:50 - starting to forget who did what so I
31:54 - apologize that I can't remember for sure
31:56 - who added the I'll show you what it is
32:02 - here and our package.json it's this
32:06 - react HTML attribute attrs so this lets
32:11 - you just write normal HTML without
32:15 - having to worry about using like class
32:16 - name instead of class and HTML for
32:19 - instead of just 4 so that's really
32:21 - useful if you have to copy and paste
32:23 - chunks of HTML otherwise if you've been
32:26 - using reactor probably used to just type
32:28 - in class or class name anyway so it's
32:34 - probably not a big deal but it
32:38 - definitely helps for copy and pasting so
32:39 - we're gonna change our labels free and
32:44 - then pay and that should be all it
32:56 - should be it like that it'll give us
32:59 - what we want so let's check it out I'll
33:04 - move this off the screen because we
33:05 - won't need this anymore and if you
33:08 - wanted to learn more I have up the mdn
33:13 - documentation for sort which we're going
33:16 - to end up using I don't know how
33:18 - we'll get to it today I don't want the
33:19 - video to be really really long but we'll
33:22 - say but in any case if you're interested
33:23 - especially if we don't get to it check
33:25 - out this I mean you just find it an NBN
33:28 - just search for sort and there's a lot
33:32 - of good info I mean it's really it's
33:34 - kind of I like this page occasionally
33:37 - the mdn pages will be just like it's too
33:40 - much for me like I just can't I can't
33:42 - figure out I have to read it several
33:43 - times but this in particular seemed to
33:46 - be pretty straightforward and easy to
33:47 - understand oh we didn't close our input
33:52 - side all right I love when we get errors
33:54 - live because then it's like a good a
33:57 - good learning moment so in the input tag
34:02 - we have to close it I'm sure someone
34:04 - said it already in the live chat that
34:06 - always you always catch my mistakes
34:09 - before I do so everything has to be
34:12 - closed out in JSX which is like the
34:15 - react version of HTML so let's close it
34:20 - out and it should work there we go all
34:30 - right so check it out we have this
34:33 - little switch here it works so obviously
34:38 - I wouldn't leave it up here like that
34:40 - and I would change the color but for now
34:41 - I'm not worried about that I just wanted
34:43 - to switch so based on what the switches
34:47 - we're gonna do some filtering I'm gonna
34:52 - check the live chat quickly just to make
34:54 - sure I don't get too far behind I've I
34:57 - found it's usually been my custom in the
34:59 - past to wait till the end to answer
35:01 - questions in the live chat but we've
35:03 - been having so much activity in the live
35:05 - chat that it actually starts to just cut
35:07 - off all the stuff from the beginning so
35:10 - I have to kind of go back now
35:11 - periodically or else I will I will miss
35:14 - your questions and I have no way to get
35:16 - them back so that's why I'm kind of
35:20 - trying to check it more often than
35:22 - normal now
35:34 - okay in regard to Keystone J's which is
35:38 - an alternative content management system
35:40 - to WordPress Bill said it appealed to
35:43 - him because it was with node and
35:46 - that's okay now I remember that one
35:48 - that's why it appealed to me as well I'm
35:50 - definitely gonna check out Keystone
35:52 - obviously I'm not gonna use it for this
35:54 - project cuz it's already so far advanced
35:56 - but I have some some smaller project and
36:00 - some really big projects that are gonna
36:02 - happen within the next year or two and
36:04 - you know if I can find an alternative to
36:07 - WordPress that's suitable I'm definitely
36:09 - interested in using it well bill says
36:14 - Rick roll the Rick Rolled front end is
36:16 - is hilarious
36:17 - yeah it was pretty funny I mean I I
36:20 - don't even know if anybody ever saw it
36:22 - but it was funny for me Oh
36:27 - Rohan says I could use the robots.txt
36:32 - file to block that's that's actually a
36:34 - good idea I can't believe I hadn't
36:36 - thought of it I'm also gonna probably
36:38 - pull out everything in the the PHP
36:41 - template files as well just just to be
36:43 - safe but that's also a good idea okay
36:53 - looks like there's some discussion and a
36:54 - lot chat about Keystone Jas so just for
36:58 - time I'm gonna skip over the discussion
37:00 - but it seems really promising to check
37:02 - it out if you're interested
37:03 - oh cool Patrick has included a link to
37:10 - be able to set up change the text size
37:13 - for the UI or in particular you know the
37:16 - things over here that you all had
37:18 - mentioned that it's really hard to read
37:20 - you know these file names so awesome
37:24 - Thank You Patrick I'm gonna copy this
37:26 - now so it doesn't get lost in the chat
37:28 - and I'll check that out so I'm gonna add
37:33 - this just to my page of random stuff
37:35 - here there we go so
37:49 - good looks McGee says taxation is theft
37:52 - all right not sure what that has to do I
37:55 - don't think I said anything relating to
37:57 - that but yeah I don't like taxes either
38:01 - so I mean I guess we need them but I'd
38:04 - rather not have to pay them right uh-huh
38:08 - also one black ded says D stream
38:12 - regularly I do stream regularly my
38:14 - schedule has been a little weird to last
38:16 - like two weeks because I was on vacation
38:19 - and then it was a holiday and I took
38:22 - it's today's off so normally I stream at
38:25 - 2 p.m. Eastern time Monday through
38:29 - Friday although the time sometimes I
38:32 - have to change depending on what's going
38:34 - on and then occasionally I just have to
38:37 - cancel completely for a day but that's
38:39 - my normal time ok now let's go back and
38:46 - now that we have our UI element in there
38:51 - we can grab this this value checks we
38:58 - don't even need to value first we can
38:59 - test it out just kind of manually and
39:01 - then hook up this this check box and
39:05 - that's all it is it this is just a check
39:08 - box it's a normal check box you get the
39:10 - value like you would normally do for a
39:12 - check box it just looks it doesn't look
39:15 - like a regular check box actually I
39:25 - forgot to check I don't know if anyone's
39:26 - familiar with the materialized framework
39:28 - I assume that this is not using any
39:30 - JavaScript to accomplish the styling for
39:32 - this check box switch here if it is
39:36 - though that's going to be a problem when
39:39 - we go to do the the server-side I don't
39:45 - think it I didn't have to initialize
39:47 - this at all so I'm hoping it doesn't use
39:49 - JavaScript and it's just plain CSS I
39:51 - suppose we'll find out at some point if
39:55 - that's the case we'll have to redo that
39:57 - because I want to do it you know write
40:02 - it within
40:03 - react component and not rely on jQuery
40:04 - which is what is used for most of the
40:08 - materialized JavaScript alright so let's
40:13 - go up here and figure out where we're
40:19 - gonna do this sorting so
40:30 - I guess it doesn't matter we'll just put
40:32 - it put it here in another function I
40:37 - want to put it above the just for
40:40 - organization purposes I want to put it
40:49 - sorry it's not a hard question I just I
40:53 - guess so I'll just put it here at the
40:55 - bottom right above the render function I
41:00 - guess that'll be that'll be fine all
41:03 - right so we'll go free the price price
41:18 - toggle that works that ik that explains
41:21 - what what this does I'm gonna make this
41:28 - I'm gonna use an arrow function for this
41:30 - and then that way this in terms of like
41:34 - the JavaScript this will be bound
41:37 - correctly just in case I need it so if
41:43 - you're not familiar with arrow functions
41:45 - I've explained it a couple times already
41:47 - so I'm gonna skip over it for those of
41:49 - you that already heard my explanation of
41:52 - several times but if you can either
41:55 - check out a previous video or there's so
41:57 - much information about arrow functions
42:00 - online and why they're good especially
42:03 - in particular with to use within react
42:06 - actually I think the react documentation
42:08 - itself explains this alright so within
42:13 - this we want to get let's see what I
42:17 - called okay so we're just we just call
42:20 - it data within state so we want to do
42:27 - this dot said state okay so I'm going to
42:31 - set the state and as as some of you in
42:34 - the live stream informed me maybe a few
42:38 - weeks ago it made shorten for me we
42:41 - never want to directly modify state
42:44 - we always want to use this set state
42:48 - function otherwise reactant won't know
42:51 - about the change and you won't get that
42:53 - rerender that you that you want so we
42:56 - want to change it within here
42:57 - okay so we're using this set state and
43:02 - we want to take data so we want to
43:07 - change what data is and then within
43:12 - there what we want to do I might have to
43:16 - bring up the the actual JSON data
43:20 - because I don't remember what I called
43:22 - the field but basically what we want to
43:26 - do is filter so we want to take this
43:33 - state dot data and then we're gonna
43:40 - filter and I am actually gonna have to
43:51 - look this up now because I will need to
43:53 - know what what we're getting and I could
43:59 - probably to speed this up by copying if
44:02 - you remember I said I'd already done
44:03 - some filtering format in events so I
44:12 - probably could have just copied yeah I
44:18 - mean I don't need it to be this do this
44:21 - much but basically basically that's all
44:27 - we need
44:28 - yeah there's not even any point coffee
44:30 - nut but I do need to get the data so let
44:35 - me grab if you see up here where we're
44:38 - initially getting the data I'm just
44:40 - gonna get this because this will give us
44:43 - most likely the contents of what data is
44:46 - gonna be so I'll go over here and we'll
44:53 - go to WP
44:57 - and we want VJ song I know that that's
45:05 - probably really small here but I'll
45:07 - increase the size on the actual JSON
45:10 - data
45:12 - alright see this is how it comes mr.
45:15 - data so here we go
45:16 - price well that that makes sense at
45:20 - least I named it something reasonable I
45:23 - couldn't remember it but it makes sense
45:25 - so I think the options are either free
45:28 - or paid so looks like I don't see
45:33 - anything paid right now but I'm pretty
45:35 - sure the options are free or paid so we
45:38 - just needed what data a CF price okay so
45:44 - what we want to do within our filter you
45:51 - want a filter only if we're gonna have
46:00 - to do a bit more to this but for now
46:03 - this will just give us the first step
46:05 - here so did
46:18 - actually I don't need sorry okay that's
46:26 - it I was wondering what I'm just calling
46:29 - it post sorry just checking it trying to
46:39 - look back at what I did earlier so I
46:44 - guess
47:02 - you
47:12 - okay actually I didn't get a live chat
47:17 - for a second because uh Fabian has a
47:20 - good point here and Fabian has helped a
47:24 - lot in making this project much better
47:27 - than it would have been if they would
47:29 - you spend me working on it so when he
47:30 - says something I
47:32 - I always pay attention so his advice is
47:36 - I wouldn't change data state but use the
47:39 - render function to display a filtered
47:41 - view of data instead by saving price
47:46 - filter parameter in States okay
47:52 - all right I'm a thing that weigh in on
47:55 - in a live chat if anyone else has an
47:59 - opinion on that because that seems like
48:04 - a good idea to me but if if we're gonna
48:10 - talk about changing I'm gonna do this
48:11 - then I might as well open it up to
48:13 - discussion so if anyone has any opinions
48:15 - so basically we're talking about is
48:16 - instead of changing data and having two
48:19 - rerender happen like that why not have a
48:23 - different like within the render
48:25 - function have a totally different view
48:27 - that gets toggled on and off based on
48:30 - the value of the price filter which
48:37 - would also be saved in state okay cool
48:42 - so everybody likes that also I will say
48:45 - this just in case this wasn't clear from
48:48 - before so that I'm safe for farther
48:53 - ahead here it is so the the user
49:00 - experience that I want to happen is that
49:02 - someone would then once they picked free
49:05 - or paid would then be able within that
49:09 - either with that free or paid be able to
49:12 - pick a category and the category would
49:15 - still show basically everything would be
49:17 - filtered let's say to paid then filtered
49:20 - further by category and then be able to
49:24 - be filtered further by these tabs
49:26 - and then even further by the search so
49:30 - if that changes anything let me know but
49:33 - that's the the functionality I want each
49:35 - filter to kind of stack on the other
49:37 - ones so it's not gonna take away
49:40 - whatever there you know it's not like
49:42 - it's gonna start from a blank slate of
49:44 - like all the data again all those
49:46 - filters are going to add up kind of like
49:48 - how Amazon does where you can you know
49:51 - check at least on the mobile app like
49:53 - you can check off they have a drop-down
49:55 - on the side and I you know you could say
49:58 - I want everything to be like prime
49:59 - eligible and I only want to see things
50:01 - that are four stars and up and I want
50:05 - those like both to be in effect both of
50:08 - those filters at the same time so okay
50:12 - good so patrick says that's even more
50:13 - reason to save filters and state and
50:16 - display based on them awesome great so
50:22 - that's good so now it's a great time to
50:24 - give my my usual disclaimer for this
50:27 - show I don't claim to be an expert in
50:29 - anything that I'm doing I am employed as
50:32 - a full-time front-end developer at a
50:33 - university this show is not me saying I
50:37 - know everything listen to me this show
50:39 - is me just saying hey this is my normal
50:41 - workflow and I'm open to any suggestions
50:45 - that you have I learned a lot on the
50:47 - show and from you all and hopefully you
50:51 - you know some of you at least learned
50:53 - something for me or at least from the
50:54 - other people in the live chat so I just
51:00 - always feel the need to give that
51:01 - disclaimer at certain times especially
51:04 - like this whenever we're kind of
51:06 - changing the I'm changing the plan on
51:08 - the fly here based on your feedback so I
51:11 - don't want to mislead anybody to think
51:13 - that you know they should that I somehow
51:16 - I'm saying that I know all this because
51:20 - I don't I'm still learning this all
51:23 - right so what we need to do then is have
51:28 - you probably initialize in state what we
51:35 - want and we'll have default so this is
51:37 - going to be price
51:40 - the default the default should probably
51:46 - be paid it depends like from a user
51:49 - standpoint they probably want to see the
51:51 - free stuff but from a business
51:54 - standpoint it probably makes more sense
51:56 - to have the paid stuff show up first
51:58 - so don't don't hate me for that but I
52:02 - just think that that makes more sense so
52:05 - we want the default to be paid right
52:17 - bill says I need a graphic to throw up
52:20 - on the screen with your disclaimer yeah
52:23 - that's true I should yeah I don't even
52:25 - know how to do that I know there there
52:27 - are ways to put up graphics but I have
52:29 - no idea how you do that in a live
52:31 - YouTube video I'm gonna have to take
52:33 - like a course or watch some videos on
52:36 - how to livestream because I just I just
52:40 - started doing this one day like
52:41 - literally I had the idea one day and
52:44 - then the very next day I just started
52:46 - doing it so I didn't really take time to
52:49 - to figure it out there's some are really
52:51 - early videos you can tell I didn't take
52:53 - time to figure it out because the
52:55 - quality is terrible but all right so
52:59 - what are you gonna have we're gonna have
53:00 - a category right so the category is
53:05 - gonna start out as all so I'll make sure
53:06 - I have an all category potentially we
53:11 - might at one at some point maybe think
53:13 - about having a featured category so you
53:16 - could show people actually that's a good
53:20 - idea let me show you this one on now
53:22 - right now I have this section that's
53:24 - featured resources but maybe I could get
53:33 - rid of it I'm not gonna make the
53:38 - decision right now I don't think but
53:40 - potentially I could get rid of this
53:42 - section because I wasn't really sure how
53:44 - I was gonna change this based on how I
53:47 - change this UI anyway so I could just
53:50 - save save the the thought about that it
53:53 - could
53:53 - simplify everything a lot make that
53:56 - whole component a lot smaller in terms
54:01 - of lines of code and JSX the default
54:06 - category could be featured I'll think
54:15 - about that for right now I'm gonna leave
54:16 - it as all we don't have any categories
54:19 - anyway right now so those all need to be
54:23 - input and I don't I don't really think
54:26 - it's the best use of my time to go in
54:28 - and input those categories so I'm just
54:30 - gonna have to let the people in charge
54:33 - of the content know about the categories
54:36 - I'll have to enable it in WordPress
54:38 - because I disabled categories for that
54:40 - post type I'll have to enable that and
54:42 - then let them know and then hopefully
54:43 - you know they'll add everything in and
54:45 - we'll start to get some good good data
54:47 - to be able to test out our category
54:50 - drop-down so I think that's sort of
54:56 - laughs now maybe we might want to switch
54:59 - over how we do these I'd hate to do this
55:04 - I mean we have this working already
55:06 - should we switch these to basically do
55:10 - the same use like the same system we
55:18 - won't have to worry about the masonry
55:20 - component and getting that to work
55:22 - anymore it's gonna be different I'm just
55:28 - gonna go and I'm gonna add a category
55:29 - now or a I'm gonna add something into
55:34 - the state object for it let's say type
55:39 - so it's gonna be resource type and this
55:43 - is also gonna be all by default and then
55:50 - for search is there any reason to do the
55:54 - search differently that we then we have
55:56 - been yeah actually we will need to
56:06 - this is there's really a good benefit to
56:09 - doing this in that I have to say out
56:14 - loud what I'm planning to do and in this
56:17 - case I just caught what seems like a big
56:20 - issue that I hadn't thought of before so
56:23 - right now the search works by sending
56:26 - requests to WordPress and getting an
56:31 - entirely new set of data from WordPress
56:33 - through the API every time something is
56:37 - typed so that actually sent a request to
56:43 - to WordPress and we got it back so it
56:46 - works great it's really fast I mean yeah
56:49 - I'd rather cut down on the the request
56:51 - but this is how it works right now but
56:56 - what I was describing a minute ago is I
56:59 - wanted to use her to be able to filter
57:02 - and then search but have all these
57:06 - filters still applied so basically I
57:14 - guess it I'm trying to think of a way
57:18 - that I could avoid making another API
57:19 - call and then simply just search the
57:21 - data but I guess this doesn't change
57:26 - anything will still search the search
57:30 - will still show us data it will send
57:32 - back data but then that data will be
57:34 - passed through all these filters and
57:37 - show up here so I don't see any way
57:43 - around that the reason being I'm not I
57:49 - don't think it's possible for me to grab
57:52 - all of the data at first because there's
57:55 - gonna there's going to be a lot of
57:58 - resources at some point at least that's
58:00 - the that's the vision of the people in
58:02 - charge of this they're they're expecting
58:05 - to have hundreds and hundreds of
58:07 - resources the WordPress API limits you
58:09 - to getting 100 posts at a time so I
58:16 - can't in one API call get everything in
58:18 - anyway so anyway having said all that if
58:22 - you have any ideas let me know I'll
58:24 - check the live chat now in case
58:25 - someone's been in anyone's commented on
58:28 - that I'm I'm not gonna attempt to tackle
58:31 - this entire problem right now you know
58:34 - we've already been streaming for an hour
58:35 - so and this doesn't have the question
58:40 - about the search thing does not have to
58:42 - be answered yet to make this work so for
58:45 - now I'm just gonna focus on this but I
58:47 - just wanted to share my thought process
58:50 - with you all to see if if anyone had any
58:53 - ideas on that
58:54 - Oh actually brandon has a good point in
59:03 - the live chat I have a toggle right now
59:05 - for free or paid but what if they want
59:08 - both that's a great point and I yeah I
59:16 - could definitely see ya a user might one
59:19 - but they might not care whether or not
59:21 - it's free or paid they just want to find
59:22 - the resources they want and it would
59:25 - actually be a pain for them to have to
59:27 - click back and forth so maybe we
59:32 - shouldn't maybe it shouldn't be a toggle
59:37 - maybe it should be and maybe another
59:41 - drop-down I hate to do another drug I
59:43 - just don't like to have a ton of
59:44 - dropdowns but that might be the only way
59:46 - let me know if you think of a different
59:48 - way the options would then be free paid
59:54 - or all I guess or it could potentially
60:01 - be checkboxes that say for your paid and
60:05 - if none of them are checked and it's all
60:06 - about a fault that might be a better
60:08 - option if it's just two checkboxes for
60:11 - free or paid and I guess it could be if
60:18 - they're both checked then you get both
60:20 - and if none of them are checked then you
60:22 - still get both that might be a little
60:24 - confusing but I don't
60:30 - I don't see any other way to do it
60:32 - because the resource is either gonna be
60:34 - free or paid all right let me know what
60:37 - you think
60:38 - okay cool someone else said checkboxes
60:41 - so weighty baifern fan 31 says
60:47 - checkboxes so great okay rowan says he
60:58 - leans drop-down with check box style
61:01 - okay
61:13 - tarek asked about throttling while
61:15 - sending requests research actually I
61:18 - didn't do it yeah I had sucked I assume
61:20 - your I talked earlier when I set it up
61:22 - about limiting the number of searches so
61:26 - like a certain number of milliseconds
61:28 - would have to pass before you're allowed
61:30 - to send another API request I don't
61:32 - think I actually I don't think I put
61:35 - that in so no I haven't done it yet but
61:41 - I intend to do that I think I put it in
61:46 - my cello board if that if not I'm gonna
61:48 - have to check and put it in there man 10
61:52 - asks about caching there's some caching
61:56 - going on right now I'm gonna also set up
61:58 - some caching on the WordPress side
62:02 - basically I just have to click a button
62:05 - to enable it right now but it's already
62:07 - set up
62:08 - it's just through a plugin though asks
62:14 - can you apply a filter to achieve all
62:17 - posts regardless 100 limit oh cool it
62:22 - looks like there's Stack Overflow I'm
62:24 - gonna copy this now and check that out
62:27 - as well I had read some stuff about
62:29 - trying to get rid of the limit so I I
62:39 - think I've read this one off I'll check
62:42 - it out too but I think the answer was
62:44 - like you'd have to build your own custom
62:47 - like endpoint or something because
62:51 - there's not like a default way to do it
62:54 - so but I'll check it out
62:55 - oh good okay bill also says how about
63:03 - some sort of pagination with the posts
63:10 - yeah a bucha says that's how these
63:17 - single page applications like to work
63:19 - get all the data then filter and sort
63:21 - locally yeah I would love to be able to
63:23 - filter sort of locally the problem for
63:25 - me
63:25 - is just right now I can get all the data
63:27 - but in the future there there may be so
63:29 - much data that that's not going to be a
63:31 - good idea to get all the data Rowland
63:37 - asks this WordPress what doesn't
63:38 - WordPress do some caching by default
63:41 - actually it might I'm not I'm not sure
63:44 - if it caches by default the caching that
63:48 - I am going to enable at some point once
63:51 - I get all my post types settled is every
63:57 - time an API call is made
64:00 - instead of like normally it would go to
64:02 - the database it's a sequel database and
64:06 - then it would put together that data and
64:09 - send it out instead what would happen is
64:13 - that would be saved in the cache so you
64:15 - make an API call and then it doesn't
64:18 - have to hit the database again so I just
64:23 - explained basic caching sorry sorry for
64:26 - everyone who already knew that but let's
64:32 - see yeah and Bill says I wouldn't rely
64:34 - on it because the plugins creator will
64:36 - fix in the future by sanitizing input
64:42 - yeah okay Roland says displaying
64:47 - hundreds of posts might be a bit
64:49 - overwhelming it just puts a network
64:51 - strain okay all right cool Brandon says
64:58 - what if we just you know we only do an
65:00 - API call on the search text box and then
65:03 - filter those results that's what I was
65:05 - thinking
65:11 - yeah Bill recommends using Redux yeah
65:15 - and I kind of wish that I had set it up
65:19 - like that but you're right at this point
65:20 - he also says that require rewrite of how
65:23 - state is managed at this point yes at
65:25 - this point I just don't have I don't
65:28 - know if I gave you all the update maybe
65:30 - I did I think I have until like the 19th
65:34 - so I have to get as much as I possibly
65:36 - can done on this site for
65:39 - what's in my Trello board by the 19th
65:42 - and then I have to move on to another
65:43 - project so I'm actually learned I'm
65:47 - taking the the Udacity react developer
65:50 - course right now so I'm going to be
65:53 - learning about how to use redux
65:56 - I think it's Redux I can't remember
66:00 - which one but one basically one of the
66:02 - things that does what Redux does so I
66:04 - know there's like Redux and mob X and so
66:06 - one of those things I'm going to be
66:07 - learning about but I'm not going to
66:08 - learn about it and enough time to
66:10 - implement it on this project so that's
66:13 - unfortunate I think it would have been
66:15 - better
66:22 - okay Tariq says use of view more button
66:25 - instead of pagination yeah that would be
66:30 - good I was saying it maybe like view
66:32 - more button here and then it just kind
66:34 - of like I can either do a few more or I
66:38 - could do infinite scroll what's your
66:40 - opinion on this I could have it so that
66:43 - once I get near the bottom of the page
66:45 - it just automatically loads more which
66:49 - may actually like it might require
66:51 - another API called
66:52 - on to be honest but we could see how I'd
66:56 - do it or I could actually have a button
66:58 - that users have to click oh cool Jacob
67:05 - says that he's taking that course as
67:07 - well awesome and they are teaching mob x
67:12 - and redux good that's really cool I like
67:14 - that they're gonna do do both of them
67:32 - all right so enough thinking it's really
67:38 - important to think these things through
67:39 - to avoid wasted work and stuff but I
67:43 - want to do something I actually want to
67:45 - get a little bit of this working and
67:47 - then that way if anybody really like
67:50 - wanted to watch this because they were
67:52 - interested in the topic and want to
67:54 - learn how to do this I at least want to
67:55 - do it I want to at least do a filter I
67:58 - might not get to a sort today but I just
68:01 - want to do one filter and get it working
68:04 - obviously I'm there's gonna be some
68:06 - changes made to it and you can all
68:09 - follow along you know on github with the
68:12 - changes and see the finished product at
68:14 - some point
