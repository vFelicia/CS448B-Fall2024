00:00 - hey everyone what's up welcome back to
00:02 - css3 in 30 days also known as code 30
00:04 - things in 30 days with css3 for the last
00:07 - few days we've been coding some really
00:08 - cool things in css3 building actual
00:11 - practical things and widgets and buttons
00:13 - and clip paths and all these fun little
00:15 - things and we're going to be
00:17 - adding more and more as we go over the
00:19 - following or over the next 30 days and
00:21 - so the purpose of doing this is to help
00:24 - you just build things just jump in and
00:27 - sometimes go in over your head figure
00:29 - out survive and just make it happen make
00:32 - it work and the cool thing is that i'm
00:34 - here to help you the people in the
00:36 - course are here to help you and the
00:38 - final css files are here to help you so
00:41 - you can reference what's going on why
00:42 - did that do that and and that's the
00:45 - purpose of this to push you to help you
00:47 - build things so that you can actually
00:48 - learn how to make things in css and css3
00:51 - so today in day four we're going to be
00:53 - building and styling up a sexy
00:55 - registration form so jump on over here
00:58 - into my browser and we're going to use
01:00 - css css to style the following web form
01:03 - right here into something visually
01:04 - attractive with a great user experience
01:07 - and of course refer to the final result
01:09 - for some help so this thing doesn't look
01:12 - so nice you know it's it's a form it's
01:15 - not functional but in theory it's
01:16 - functional let's say it created an
01:18 - account you know you enter your name and
01:20 - your email and then or your
01:22 - your email and your password and your
01:24 - create your account you know it's a form
01:26 - it's html
01:27 - it
01:28 - works in theory but it doesn't look good
01:31 - it doesn't have a good user experience
01:32 - or a good user interface so if i scroll
01:34 - down
01:36 - this final result is much more
01:37 - attractive it's got a nice background a
01:39 - cool gradient in the back to pop the the
01:42 - login create an account widget pops up
01:45 - off the background you can enter you
01:48 - know it gives you instructions it's very
01:50 - clear the conventions of this form look
01:53 - very much like what people are used to
01:56 - you know it's very nice and appealing
01:58 - you know you click on an input and it
01:59 - fades in a little bit it's just it
02:02 - focuses it looks nice the button is cool
02:04 - you go to click on it and it kind of has
02:06 - this really neat like kind of a striped
02:08 - effect that grows in the background and
02:10 - then even when you hover over this
02:12 - uh widget itself it almost like shuffles
02:15 - down paper like cards almost like you're
02:17 - holding a deck of cards so it just all
02:19 - around has a neat user experience and
02:21 - user interface so we're going to be
02:23 - doing that in css and css3
02:26 - over in our code editor i've got a for a
02:29 - folder called sexy registration form
02:30 - it's number four in this module there is
02:33 - a link to download number four sexy
02:36 - registration forms open that up in your
02:38 - code editor of course we have the index
02:40 - with all the markup that you are more
02:42 - than welcome to reference
02:44 - sandbox.css where we are going to be
02:46 - coding our styles and final.css that you
02:48 - can use for reference to see how the
02:51 - final result is built so if you have any
02:53 - problems or mistakes then you can you
02:55 - can go there refer to that and fix up
02:57 - those issues
02:59 - so enter sandbox at css
03:01 - let's get started now before we write a
03:04 - lick of css let's go to our html
03:07 - i know i'm jumping you all over the
03:08 - place here but hang with me
03:10 - and let's see the markup the markup's
03:12 - super simple we have a div with the
03:14 - class of a register wrapper within that
03:16 - we have a div called register block
03:19 - and then in there we have a level three
03:21 - heading a paragraph
03:23 - and then the form itself with three
03:25 - inputs within it an email password and a
03:27 - submit button
03:28 - so very very simple markup just
03:31 - at 4 8
03:32 - 9 10 11 you know like 10 or 11 lines of
03:35 - css very very simple markup
03:38 - then our sandbox is where all the magic
03:40 - is going to happen in our css so let's
03:42 - start off by selecting the register dash
03:45 - wrapper
03:46 - and in there we're going to do the
03:48 - background image and we're going to give
03:50 - it a webkit
03:52 - linear gradient
03:54 - and it's going to be at 135 degrees
03:58 - the color we're going to start with 0 e
04:01 - f f 0
04:02 - at a 30
04:04 - color stop
04:06 - and then
04:07 - the next color so comma separate 0 8 8 f
04:10 - 90 at a 90 color stop so those two
04:13 - colors the first color value and the
04:15 - second color value
04:17 - that starts at 30 percent
04:20 - and then
04:21 - uh 90 so that gradient will
04:25 - use those as color stops to give
04:27 - transitions to create an interesting
04:29 - gradient that happens in those specific
04:31 - color stops
04:33 - so what i'm going to do there is i'm
04:35 - going to copy that
04:36 - and make sure we semicolon paste it and
04:39 - instead of webkit linear gradient for
04:40 - the second we're gonna just use linear
04:42 - gradient same values don't worry about
04:44 - changing anything there semicolon and
04:46 - we're gonna say position relative
04:49 - and then the z index will be three
04:52 - padding let's give it 100 pixels on all
04:54 - sides the font size i don't think we
04:57 - need to play around with font size size
04:59 - actually color is going to be triple
05:00 - nine the color
05:02 - of the text within it is gonna be triple
05:04 - nine
05:06 - now save that let's see what we got here
05:08 - in our there we go so
05:10 - check this out we have 135 degree angle
05:13 - it's going down kind of from top left to
05:15 - the bottom right
05:17 - slightly off it's more so going from
05:18 - like here to here i believe you know so
05:21 - whatever 135 degrees is and change the
05:24 - value to see what what happens and then
05:26 - the we got the gradient at the 30 color
05:29 - stop around here and then the 90 color
05:31 - stop here so you could see how they you
05:33 - know if you were to change those color
05:34 - stop values or add more you would see
05:36 - how the gradient changed or if you added
05:38 - more colors with different color stops
05:39 - feel free to play with that just to
05:41 - become familiar
05:42 - the color is triple nine 100 pixels of
05:45 - padding looks good let's go back to our
05:46 - code editor
05:48 - and get back into it so register
05:50 - wrapper and then the asterisk which is
05:52 - basically a catch-all it it selects
05:55 - every element within the register
05:57 - wrapper did
05:59 - and we're just going to say box sizing
06:01 - is going to be border box basically the
06:03 - reason why we want to do that
06:05 - is to so that the padding doesn't add
06:07 - any value of any of the elements within
06:09 - there when we add padding we don't want
06:11 - it to add any width to the container we
06:13 - want it to stay within the border box
06:15 - rather than when we add 30 pixels on
06:18 - either side of a 100 pixel box we don't
06:20 - want it to be 160 pixels now because
06:22 - it's added some weight some size we want
06:25 - it to stay within there and just work
06:26 - with this the fixed width so that's the
06:29 - border box property box sizing property
06:31 - rather
06:33 - and then now let's go below that we're
06:35 - going to say register wrapper
06:38 - form
06:39 - and then input so we're selecting all
06:41 - the inputs there's three of them
06:42 - display inline block the width will be
06:46 - 100 percent the padding we're gonna go
06:48 - zero on top and bottom 20 pixels left
06:50 - and right
06:51 - the line height uh is going to be
06:55 - 50 pixels
06:57 - the height will be 50 pixels so this
06:59 - will center the vertically center of the
07:01 - text
07:04 - the background color is going to be
07:06 - white
07:07 - the border will be solid 1 pixel
07:11 - e6 e6 e6
07:14 - the border
07:16 - bottom width will be three pixels so
07:18 - we'll have a larger bottom border
07:21 - the border radius we're gonna give it
07:23 - something subtle like five pixels
07:25 - and we're gonna do
07:27 - webkit transition
07:30 - uh all 0.3 seconds and ease we've been
07:34 - using that a lot and then copy that
07:36 - paste it and just make it transition
07:38 - all 3.3 seconds ease save that head back
07:40 - to the browser check it out so we have
07:42 - this 100
07:43 - width like big
07:45 - nice inputs when you click on it it
07:48 - fades some things in there with the
07:49 - transition it fades in the border but
07:51 - that outline kind of messes up the
07:53 - effect a little bit so let's head back
07:55 - and we're going to
07:57 - just probably under here say outline
07:59 - none save that head back over here now
08:02 - that should have taken care of that
08:03 - outline
08:05 - very nice okay
08:06 - so now what we're going to do is head
08:07 - back to our code editor and we're going
08:09 - to select register wrapper
08:12 - form input and then colon
08:15 - and it's going to match
08:17 - not
08:18 - so it matches an element that is not
08:20 - represented by the argument so what are
08:21 - we not selecting here this is a cool css
08:24 - trick here so form input not
08:28 - another colon
08:29 - last child so a virtual element here so
08:32 - matches any element that is the last
08:34 - child of its parent basically we want to
08:36 - select the inputs that are not the last
08:38 - child don't select the last element
08:41 - uh the last input element within the
08:43 - form which is the submit button so
08:45 - that's just an interesting css selector
08:47 - css3 selector way of just saying don't
08:50 - select the input we could have just
08:51 - given an id and just said don't select
08:53 - that or something but this is just a
08:55 - little bit more of a fun way of doing it
08:57 - it's a bit more dynamic
08:58 - margin bottom
09:00 - for the two inputs are going to be 20
09:02 - pixels
09:05 - save that now head over to your browser
09:07 - you can see that it affected only these
09:08 - two and not this one there's no margin
09:10 - bottom for the create my account button
09:13 - cool now head back to the code editor
09:15 - we're going to select the register
09:17 - wrapper again
09:18 - the form
09:19 - input and then in square braces we're
09:22 - going to select the type attribute and
09:25 - email
09:26 - and then focus
09:27 - separate by comma copy that paste it out
09:30 - three more times change the attribute
09:32 - the type attribute
09:33 - to email
09:35 - and then active
09:37 - as the state and then the third value
09:40 - here is gonna be oh sorry password
09:43 - and that's gonna be focus and then
09:44 - password
09:46 - active
09:47 - remove that last comma
09:49 - curly braces
09:51 - border color let's do triple c
09:54 - save that check it out in the browser
09:56 - when we
09:57 - focus
09:58 - we get this triple c darker kind of gray
10:00 - border
10:02 - and active so you can see
10:05 - that that covers basically when you
10:07 - click on it it changes the border color
10:08 - and gives it just a little bit nicer of
10:10 - a focus which takes care of the fact
10:11 - that we removed the outline created our
10:14 - own outline essentially
10:16 - now let's select the register wrapper
10:19 - again
10:20 - form input but this time we're going to
10:22 - select the type
10:23 - uh and the value the attribute will be
10:26 - submit so we want to select that submit
10:27 - button and change the style up for that
10:29 - one so let's go ahead and say position
10:32 - relative
10:33 - we're gonna go z index one
10:36 - display inline block
10:39 - padding zero and twenty
10:42 - zero on top and bottom twenty left and
10:44 - right pixels of course let's go
10:46 - background color just the background is
10:48 - going to be
10:49 - actually do background color because
10:50 - we're going to be selecting background
10:52 - image later we're going to go f
10:54 - 2
10:55 - 3 9 5 a
10:58 - background size 100
11:01 - and then we're going to play around with
11:02 - something cool here background image
11:04 - we're going to do the webkit linear
11:07 - gradient
11:09 - and give a little space there
11:11 - because we're going to do
11:13 - something interesting we're going to
11:15 - create stripes
11:16 - now normally what you would do to create
11:18 - stripes you don't have to know this
11:20 - stuff off by heart is you just go to
11:21 - like a
11:22 - linear css3 linear gradient generator
11:25 - online you google that and then you just
11:26 - play around with it and you can do
11:27 - different code snippets and paste it in
11:29 - and you're off to the races no need to
11:31 - reinvent the wheel but here we're going
11:33 - to manually code this out
11:36 - so you can create the striped effect
11:38 - which looks like this over here in the
11:39 - browser so this striped effect
11:42 - so the first value is going to be the
11:44 - degree in which we want the val the
11:46 - stripes to go so 45 degrees
11:48 - first value is rgba we're going to use
11:50 - that because we want to say 255 255 255.
11:54 - 0.15 which is like 15
11:57 - and then 25 percent color stop
12:00 - now if i left it at that all you're
12:02 - going to get is just one single color we
12:05 - won't see any
12:06 - change there now if i go back to my code
12:08 - editor and add another value say rgba
12:11 - zero zero zero and then zero basically
12:14 - that's like black but you can't see it
12:16 - so it's creating just like kind of an
12:17 - empty chunk at twenty five percent color
12:20 - stop save that let's see what's gonna
12:22 - happen so go over here you're going to
12:24 - see
12:25 - now we actually have a bit of a stripe
12:27 - there it's kind of created at the 25
12:29 - color stop on the 45 degree angle a bit
12:31 - of something something's going on there
12:32 - now if we change this to like i don't
12:34 - know like 0.8 go over here to your
12:37 - browser you can see that this part is
12:39 - actually
12:40 - the black part it's at 25 to 25 color
12:43 - stop at the 45 degree angle you can see
12:45 - the black but because we want it at zero
12:46 - we don't really want to see it
12:48 - it's going to create this effect uh
12:51 - right there
12:52 - all right so let's just keep moving
12:53 - we're gonna do another line here rgba
12:56 - we're gonna do zero zero zero zero again
12:59 - at the fifty percent color stop save
13:00 - that and you're not gonna see any change
13:02 - there yet until we get to the next value
13:04 - so go down to the next line rgba 255 255
13:08 - 255
13:09 - comma
13:10 - 0.15 this is white
13:13 - at 15
13:14 - 50 color stop save that head back over
13:18 - to the browser now we got a stripe going
13:20 - on
13:20 - so you can see that at the 50 mark we're
13:23 - starting to make some stripes so carry
13:25 - on carry on back in the browser or the
13:27 - code editor here rgba
13:30 - we're going to go 2d525 do a device
13:33 - 0.15 again at the 75 color stop and
13:37 - let's continue to the next line we're
13:39 - going to say rgba we're going to do that
13:40 - space again with the zero zero zero zero
13:43 - the black at the 75 percent
13:46 - color stop and then last but not least
13:49 - we're gonna do one more rgba zero zero
13:51 - whoops zero zero zero zero
13:54 - at just we're gonna leave it that's just
13:56 - the end
13:58 - save that so if we head over here we can
14:00 - see in our browser it's just
14:03 - pink so something went wrong let's go to
14:05 - our code editor i can see it here i put
14:07 - a comma you might have caught that
14:08 - instead of a decimal just typing too
14:10 - fast not thinking save that head back to
14:12 - the browser put that obviously put that
14:14 - as a decimal head over here you can see
14:15 - the stripes now but they're a little bit
14:17 - large and that's because of the
14:18 - background size so head back here in the
14:20 - code editor we can change that right
14:21 - here in background size we could do
14:22 - something like 20 pixels
14:25 - and then 20 pixels so two values so 20
14:27 - pixels on the x and y head over here to
14:30 - the browser you can see we've got
14:33 - we've got our stripes that looks cool so
14:35 - now let's continue we're going to say
14:36 - border
14:37 - solid 1 pixel we're going to go f02146
14:43 - and then we're gonna do border
14:45 - oh border bottom width we're gonna do
14:49 - three pixels again we're gonna say the
14:51 - color is white
14:53 - the outline is none we don't want any
14:55 - outline on there as well
14:57 - cursor and pointer sometimes you need to
14:58 - add that for
15:00 - input that are inputs that are buttons
15:02 - and then webkits transition
15:04 - all 0.3 seconds ease copy that paste it
15:08 - out change it to just transition save it
15:10 - head back over here to the browser we've
15:12 - got a nice neat button that looks nice
15:14 - and consistent beautiful head back to
15:17 - our code editor here now let's play
15:19 - around with the
15:21 - effect when you hover over this button
15:22 - so we're going to say i'm going to tab
15:24 - this in i'm going to say register
15:25 - wrapper
15:27 - form input
15:28 - submit so we're clicking that we're
15:30 - getting that button again but the hover
15:32 - the hover state and we're just changing
15:34 - the background size to 40 pixels 40
15:37 - pixels so we're going to increase that
15:38 - background size so head over here to the
15:39 - browser hover over that button it just
15:43 - you get that effect so it creates the it
15:45 - transitions the background size to
15:47 - double the size of what it was before
15:48 - you could change it to something really
15:50 - big if you want like 80 and 80
15:52 - and see what happens
15:54 - so pretty intense a little bit too much
15:57 - to you know i like subtlety so 40 and 40
16:00 - works for me
16:02 - and now we're gonna go to the next line
16:04 - and we're going to say
16:06 - register
16:08 - title so we're just gonna
16:10 - tidy up a few of these things here
16:11 - register title
16:13 - font size let's do like
16:16 - two rim
16:18 - and then padding
16:20 - bottom 20 pixels
16:22 - margin 0
16:25 - 0 20
16:26 - pixels
16:28 - border bottom we're going to do
16:30 - dashed
16:32 - 1 pixel e6 e6 e6 save that let's check
16:35 - it out what it looks like
16:37 - nice
16:38 - you know
16:39 - nothing crazy it'll look better once we
16:41 - have a background on the whole wrapper
16:42 - there
16:43 - which we'll do here so let's go down the
16:45 - next line we're going to say register
16:48 - block and now we're going to style that
16:50 - up we're going to go position relative
16:53 - we're going to say display block
16:55 - width is 100
16:58 - max width is 300 pixels so that's like
17:01 - so it can be responsive
17:04 - up to a maximum of 30 sorry 300 pixels
17:07 - margin and we're going to just say
17:09 - zero auto because i don't think we have
17:11 - any yeah zero auto so it'll center it
17:14 - padding will be 30 pixels background
17:17 - we'll do white
17:19 - box shadow let's add some box shadows 0
17:21 - 0 and 50 pixels
17:23 - and rgb a
17:26 - there we go 0 0 0 0.2 so it'll be like a
17:29 - very subtle black box shadow and then
17:32 - border radius 5 pixels
17:34 - save it let's check out what the
17:35 - register block looks like check it out
17:37 - looks nice already looks nice and
17:40 - subtle
17:41 - i like it i like it
17:43 - however when i'm looking here the font
17:45 - size is a little bit too big all around
17:46 - so let's go up to the top of our css
17:49 - here
17:50 - and we're going to
17:52 - go register wrapper and change the font
17:54 - size i'm going to change the font size
17:57 - let's do one ram and see what that does
17:59 - does it make it smaller
18:00 - uh it does make it smaller over here in
18:02 - the browser except for the
18:04 - headline is a little little bit large
18:06 - which is down here in our code editor we
18:08 - did that in the register title 2 ram
18:11 - let's make that 1.2 ram 1.2
18:14 - too small maybe 1.6 ram
18:17 - there we go that looks much better here
18:18 - in the browser okay
18:20 - back to what we were doing in the first
18:22 - place so we did the register block now
18:24 - what we want to do is create that cool
18:25 - effect check this out when we hover over
18:28 - it we get that kind of like shuffling
18:29 - card effect
18:32 - let's go to our sandbox again
18:34 - and we're going to create that so the
18:36 - register block i'm going to tab this in
18:38 - because it's
18:39 - related
18:40 - register block the before
18:43 - pseudo element
18:45 - and comma
18:47 - the register block
18:50 - after pseudo element we're going to
18:52 - style both those up position
18:55 - absolute
18:57 - z index negative one because it's going
18:58 - to be behind the parent container
19:02 - zero
19:04 - top uh left
19:06 - uh right and bottom are all going to be
19:07 - zero
19:08 - and now we're going to say display block
19:11 - width 100
19:13 - height 100 so it matches the
19:15 - original element the register block
19:17 - elements height and width content needs
19:19 - to be an empty string so that uh so
19:22 - these pseudo elements will actually
19:23 - appear if you don't have that then they
19:25 - won't show up that's something that a
19:26 - lot of web developers beginner web
19:28 - designers and developers forget
19:30 - background we're going to say
19:32 - white
19:33 - border
19:34 - solid 1 pixel
19:36 - e6 e6 e6 okay and then we're going to do
19:40 - border radius we're going to match what
19:42 - was
19:43 - uh
19:44 - we're going to match the rest of it at 5
19:46 - pixels now what we're going to do is
19:49 - we're going to scale them so if i save
19:51 - this and check it out you
19:52 - won't really see anything
19:54 - nothing's going to be there so we're
19:56 - going to scale these and then we're
19:58 - going to create a hover effect that
20:00 - makes them appear so we're going to say
20:02 - webkit transform
20:06 - scale
20:07 - 0.9
20:08 - it's a little bit smaller
20:10 - translate
20:11 - 0 and 0.
20:13 - copy that paste it out we're going to
20:16 - change that to just transform
20:19 - beauty
20:20 - and then transition
20:22 - is going to be
20:24 - all 0.3 seconds ease all right so that
20:27 - one is done you're not going to see that
20:30 - at all yet
20:31 - until we create this next effect which
20:34 - is going to be register block it's going
20:36 - to be hover
20:38 - so when we hover over the register block
20:41 - we're going to style the before pseudo
20:43 - element let's say webkit transform
20:47 - scale so i'm just going to paste what we
20:48 - had there scale
20:50 - but we're going to change it to
20:51 - something slightly larger 0.96 so it's
20:53 - not the same size as the as the original
20:56 - register block and the translate this is
20:58 - the x and y offset 16 pixels down on the
21:02 - y axis this one's just gonna be
21:05 - transform
21:07 - and copy this out
21:09 - right below register block hover and
21:12 - after
21:12 - we're gonna make this one even just a
21:14 - little bit smaller than the than the
21:16 - before pseudo-element
21:19 - and this one's gonna be 32 pixels down
21:23 - now i'm going to save this but i'm going
21:24 - to comment this out first and show you
21:26 - what that first one does so save that
21:28 - check this out in the browser hover and
21:30 - that first that before pseudo-element
21:32 - pops down
21:34 - and that's pretty cool so now what we're
21:36 - going to do is head back here uncomment
21:38 - what we just coded up save that and
21:40 - let's see what happens
21:42 - so watch this do you see how the after
21:44 - pseudo element is appearing in front of
21:47 - the before suit element that's because
21:48 - it is after
21:50 - cascade in the cascading style sheet and
21:52 - it's going to appear in front so that's
21:55 - why we use zed index so that's where
21:57 - we're going to go here for the before
21:59 - we're going to say z index is going to
22:01 - be negative 1 because that's what it
22:02 - originally is and for the after pseudo
22:05 - element we want this one to be z index
22:07 - negative 2. so it's actually behind the
22:10 - before pseudo element back to the
22:12 - browser hover
22:13 - there it is just like that now if you
22:15 - wanted to do another really cool effect
22:17 - here let's try something
22:19 - i want to do this
22:21 - ease so that i'm going to try and make
22:23 - it so that they both don't come down at
22:24 - the same time i want to make the after
22:26 - pseudo element come down just a little
22:28 - bit later so let's see if we can try
22:30 - that
22:31 - we're going to say
22:32 - you see here we have before and after
22:34 - have the same transition let's just add
22:37 - one more line here and say register
22:38 - block
22:40 - after and we're going to make it have a
22:43 - different transition time all you can
22:45 - even do something like
22:47 - transition delay
22:49 - yeah let's do the delay we want it to
22:50 - delay by
22:52 - oh very very subtle like point
22:55 - two seconds that might be
22:57 - well let's just see what happens
22:59 - okay check this out here in the browser
23:02 - with the 0.2 second delay watch what
23:04 - happens
23:07 - it's kind of a little bit weird so let's
23:09 - make that delay
23:10 - really small like maybe even 0.05
23:15 - seconds and now let's check it out
23:18 - see how it has kind of like it's like
23:20 - it's chasing
23:23 - i like that
23:25 - cool
23:26 - it works for me so that's just a cool
23:28 - little
23:29 - effect and so there we go there we have
23:31 - our sexy registration form
23:33 - that we built in css and css3 using a
23:36 - bunch just css css3 no images no
