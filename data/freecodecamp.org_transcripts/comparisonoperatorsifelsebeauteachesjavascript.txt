00:00 - hello I'm going to talk about comparison
00:02 - operators and if else statements first
00:05 - of all let's look at some code here we
00:07 - have our is FCC great and I've set this
00:10 - variable here's how we declare a
00:12 - variable here's the name of the variable
00:13 - we've set that to be equal to true so
00:16 - now look this is the if statement down
00:17 - here if and then in parentheses we put
00:20 - something that we're testing we're just
00:21 - going to put this variable which we've
00:23 - set to true so if whatever's in here
00:25 - which we have as is FCC great if this is
00:28 - true we are going to do whatever is in
00:32 - these brackets so what's in this
00:34 - brackets is console.log freec code Camp
00:37 - is amazing so if we run that it is going
00:41 - to say free code Camp is
00:43 - amazing however if we change this to
00:47 - false and we I'm going to clear the
00:50 - console and run that
00:52 - again it's not going to do anything
00:54 - because since this is false it's not
00:57 - going to do what's in the brackets but
00:58 - to be able to see that better I'm going
01:00 - to add an else so
01:05 - else so let me just copy this I'm going
01:08 - to paste it down here and put
01:13 - horrible and we're going to run that so
01:17 - if this is true it's going to do what's
01:18 - in the first brackets but when we have
01:21 - else else means if it's false it's going
01:23 - to do what in the second brackets
01:25 - however we better change this back to
01:27 - True before Quincy sees
01:28 - it and there there that's what it should
01:31 - say free code Camp is amazing okay now
01:34 - we're going to talk about comparison
01:39 - operators comparison operators are more
01:43 - than less than less than or equal to
01:47 - more than or equal to equals equals
01:49 - which just means equals or not equals
01:53 - the less than or more than symbols the
01:55 - way I remember which one is which is if
01:57 - you see the less than symbol kind of
02:00 - looks like the letter L the less than
02:02 - symbol opens the same direction as a
02:04 - capital l which is the first letter in
02:07 - the word less than so let's put in some
02:09 - code here to test these
02:13 - out I put H equals 18 and if age is
02:18 - greater than or equal to
02:26 - 18 so if it's 18 or any number more than
02:29 - 18 we're going to console that log you
02:31 - are an adult let me run that and it says
02:33 - you are an adult now this is where we
02:36 - can use some some else if statements uh
02:39 - that's a new thing I want to show you
02:40 - else if now before it's either two
02:43 - things it's EI either doing one thing or
02:46 - we're doing the other thing but else if
02:49 - we're going to do something if age is
02:50 - more than equal to
02:52 - 18 else if now this may not always
02:56 - happen depending on what's in the the
02:59 - parentheses for the if we're going to
03:01 - say age is less than
03:04 - 18 and I'm just going to copy this up
03:08 - here you
03:10 - are a
03:13 - child if we if we run this it's just
03:15 - going to be pretty similar it's just
03:16 - going to say you are an adult but if I
03:18 - change this to one and we run that it's
03:22 - going to say you are a child let's try
03:25 - put another thing in here else
03:28 - if
03:32 - we're going to say else if age is less
03:34 - than two console.log you are a baby and
03:36 - this is going to give me a good chance
03:37 - to show you something else if I click
03:39 - run it's going to say you are a child
03:41 - it's not going to say you are a baby
03:43 - even though the age is one the age is
03:46 - less than two but it's not saying you
03:48 - are a baby because once the program
03:52 - evaluates one of these it stops
03:54 - evaluating so look at this else if age
03:56 - is less than 18 console.log you were a
03:59 - child now that this has been evaluated
04:01 - it's not going to even check any of the
04:03 - other items so it's not even going to
04:05 - check this that's why it can be very
04:07 - important to order you put things so for
04:09 - this example we probably want to put
04:11 - this up here I'm just copying and
04:12 - pasting
04:13 - here and now we're going to check about
04:16 - the age being less than two first and
04:18 - then check if the age is less than 18
04:20 - and that should do more of what we're
04:22 - trying to get at
04:23 - here and now it is going to say you are
04:25 - a baby if we change this to 10 um it's
04:28 - going to say let's see you were a child
04:31 - and it's still going to say say anything
04:33 - above
04:36 - 18 it's going to say you are an adult so
04:40 - let's check a few more things we're
04:42 - going to show the equal equals and the
04:44 - not
04:49 - equals and change this to 18 and we're
04:53 - going to try that we're going to run
04:54 - that you are 18 so it says if age equals
04:58 - equals 18 console.log 8 so the important
05:03 - thing about this is that to check if
05:05 - something is equal you always use two
05:08 - equal signs because if you only use one
05:11 - equal sign that's an assignment operator
05:14 - and now we are going to set the variable
05:17 - age to be equal to 18 instead of
05:22 - checking to see if age does equal 18 now
05:27 - something interesting about that is that
05:28 - it's still gonna put true because
05:32 - whenever you set a variable equal to a
05:34 - number it's always going to evaluate as
05:36 - true but now later in the program if if
05:40 - we have it started at 10 and then we're
05:43 - going to set it to 18 now age is going
05:45 - to equal 18 so you want to make sure you
05:47 - always use two equal signs that's how
05:50 - you test if something is equal there's
05:52 - also a comparison operated with three
05:54 - equal signs equals equals equals I'm
05:56 - going to talk about that in a future
05:57 - video for now the last one I want to
05:59 - show show you is the not equal so if you
06:01 - put the exclamation point right before
06:03 - if age does not equal 18 we're going to
06:06 - say you are not 18 let me clear the
06:09 - console and we're going to run that and
06:11 - it's going to say you are not 18 okay
06:13 - well those are if and else statements
06:15 - and comparison operators thanks for
