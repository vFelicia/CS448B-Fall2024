00:00 - in this video i'll be going over an
00:01 - example of the distributive law
00:04 - so if you look at a intersection b union
00:07 - c that is supposed to equal a
00:09 - intersection b union a intersection c
00:12 - so if we can if we decompose this
00:14 - equation and look at let's start with a
00:17 - intersection b
00:18 - then that equals
00:19 - singleton 3 based off from these
00:22 - predetermined sets
00:24 - and then if we look at a intersection c
00:26 - that equals the set 1 3. so the union of
00:29 - these two is going to be the set
00:32 - containing elements one and three
00:35 - now if we look at b union c that equals
00:37 - the set containing elements one three
00:39 - beta and gamma
00:40 - and if we take the intersection of that
00:42 - set with a we're left with a set
00:44 - containing elements one and three which
00:46 - is good because now we've shown that
00:48 - this is equal to that
00:50 - now if we look at a union b intersection
00:52 - c
00:53 - that's supposed to equal a union b
00:55 - intersection a union c so if we analyze
00:59 - b intersection c that equals singleton 3
01:02 - and then a union b
01:04 - right here equals 1 3 x beta gamma
01:08 - and a union c equals the set containing
01:10 - elements 1 3 and x
01:12 - so when we take the intersection of
01:14 - these two sets we're left with the set
01:16 - containing elements 1 3 and x
01:18 - and when we take the union of b
01:20 - intersection c
01:22 - with a
01:23 - we're left with the second containing
01:24 - elements one three and x which
01:27 - is exactly what we wanted so yeah we've
01:29 - shown that these are in fact true
