00:00 - in this video I will talk about how to
00:02 - add and remove elements in jQuery if you
00:05 - need help adding jQuery to your project
00:07 - check out my getting started with jQuery
00:09 - video so the appended and prepended
00:13 - methods add new elements as child
00:15 - elements to the Target and the after and
00:17 - before methods add new elements as
00:20 - sibling elements so right now I just
00:22 - have this code up here and I do have
00:24 - some styling down here and one thing I
00:27 - do have some styling for a child element
00:29 - El and a sibling element so it's more
00:33 - obvious what where the child and sibling
00:35 - elements are so let's add some jQuery
00:39 - here so first I'm going to select the
00:41 - Target and then do
00:47 - append okay you can see I appended a div
00:50 - with the class of child and it just says
00:52 - append inside so I'm run that and see
00:54 - what happens remember a pin and pre
00:57 - pinned add elements as child elements to
00:59 - the the target so that just means it's
01:02 - going to be inside the Target and it's
01:05 - going to be a child inside the Target
01:08 - and so I'll show you the same thing with
01:09 - prepend just going to copy and paste
01:13 - this and if we run that we can see prein
01:17 - is inside the target so now we're going
01:19 - to do before and after and as you can
01:22 - see you can chain these methods together
01:24 - pretty easily I'm going to do before but
01:27 - now I'm going to do the class as sibling
01:30 - and we'll put
01:32 - before run
01:34 - that and now it's going to be before the
01:38 - item and then after is pretty much just
01:40 - like
01:43 - that you can also add more than one
01:46 - element at a time so if I just go up to
01:49 - the a pend I'm going to do a comma and
01:51 - I'm going to add another element this
01:52 - time I'm going to add a paragraph
01:56 - element so we appended this child div
01:59 - and then we we appended another
02:00 - paragraph down here and you can also
02:04 - appin prepend do before and after to
02:06 - many things at once so for instance I
02:09 - can select all the paragraph
02:15 - tags and if I run
02:17 - that you can see the word Lots was
02:20 - appended to the end of each paragraph
02:23 - tag and it's in bold and to remove
02:26 - elements and content there are mainly
02:28 - two jQuery methods we have remove which
02:31 - removes the selected element and the
02:33 - child elements and empty which removes
02:35 - the child elements from the selected
02:37 - element so let me show you some examples
02:40 - of
02:42 - that so here I'm selecting the Target
02:44 - and I'm calling the remove method if I
02:47 - just run that the entire Target is going
02:49 - to be gone now we just have the before
02:51 - and after divs that we added before
02:54 - however if we move this remove and put
02:57 - it above when we appended and prepended
03:00 - things uh now it's not going to be able
03:02 - to appin and prein things so so now it's
03:05 - not going to show the before and after
03:07 - because there's no target to add things
03:10 - before and after okay let's move that
03:12 - back down we can also remove all the
03:16 - paragraph tags so now we just have the
03:20 - child and sibling divs left and then the
03:23 - other thing was empty we're going to go
03:25 - back to selecting the Target and I'm
03:28 - going to run the empty method
03:30 - so now the target div is still there but
03:33 - everything inside the target div is
03:35 - gone I'm going to show you one final
03:38 - thing with the remove method we're going
03:41 - to go back to selecting all the
03:42 - paragraphs remove and now I can enter a
03:46 - parameter to filter what's being removed
03:49 - so if I add a class to this paragraph
03:53 - tag now I can actually remove it based
03:56 - on that class so now instead of removing
04:00 - all the paragraphs I'm just going to
04:02 - remove the paragraph that has the filter
04:04 - class so if I run
04:07 - that you can see the filter this
04:09 - paragraph Was This div is a target for
04:12 - all sorts of things and it's not in here
04:14 - anymore okay well thanks for watching my
