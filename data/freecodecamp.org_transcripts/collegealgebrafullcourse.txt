00:17 - This video is about the exponent rules, rules
that govern expressions like two to the fifth,
00:23 - or x to the n.
00:26 - two to the fifth is just shorthand for two
times two times two times two times two, written
00:32 - five times. And similarly x to the n is just
x multiplied by itself. And times
00:40 - when we write these expressions, the number
on the bottom that's being multiplied by itself
00:47 - is called the base. And the number at the
top telling us how many times we're multiplying
00:54 - the base by itself is called the exponent.
00:58 - Sometimes the exponent is also called the
power.
01:02 - The product rule says that a 5x to the power
of n times x to the power of m, that's the
01:10 - same thing as x to the n plus m power. In
other words, when I multiply two expressions
01:19 - with the same base,
01:23 - then I can add their exponents.
01:27 - For example, if I have two cubed times two
to the fourth, that's equal to two to the
01:33 - seventh. And that makes sense, because two
cubed times two to the fourth, means I multiply
01:40 - two by itself three times. And then I multiply
that by two multiplied by itself four times.
01:46 - And in the end, I have to multiplied by itself
seven times,
01:53 - which is two to the seventh,
01:56 - I'm just adding up the number of times as
multiplied in each piece, to get the number
02:01 - of times as multiplied total.
02:04 - The quotient rule says that if I have x to
the n power divided by x to the m power, that's
02:10 - equal to x to the n minus m power. In other
words, if I divide two expressions with the
02:17 - same base,
02:19 - then I can subtract their exponents.
02:23 - For example, three to the six divided by three
squared is going to be three to the six minus
02:31 - two, or three to the fourth. And this makes
sense, because three to the six means I multiply
02:37 - three by itself six times, and then I divide
that by three multiplied by itself twice.
02:45 - So when I cancel out threes, I have four threes
left,
02:50 - notice that I have to subtract the number
of threes on the bottom, from the number of
02:54 - threes at the top to get my number of threes
remaining. That's why subtract my exponents.
03:01 - The power rule tells us if I have x to the
n power raised to the m power, that's the
03:08 - same thing as x to the n times M power. In
other words, when I raise a power to a power,
03:17 - I get to multiply the exponents.
03:21 - For example, five to the fourth cubed is equal
to five to the four times three, or five to
03:29 - the 12th. And this makes sense, because five
to the fourth cubed can be thought of as five
03:34 - to the fourth times five to the fourth, times
five to the fourth, expanding this out some
03:40 - more, that's five times five times five times
five times the same thing times the same thing
03:49 - again.
03:51 - So I have three groups of four, or five, which
is a total of three times four, or 12. fives.
04:03 - The next rule involves what happens when I
raise a number, or a variable to the zeroeth
04:09 - power, it turns out that anything to the zeroeth
power is equal to one.
04:14 - Usually, this is just taken as a definition.
But here's why it makes sense to me.
04:20 - If you have something like two cubed divided
by two cubed, Well, certainly that has to
04:27 - equal one, anything divided by itself is just
one. But using the quotient rule,
04:35 - we know that this is the same thing as two
to the three minus three, because when we
04:40 - divide two things with the same base, we get
to subtract their exponents. Therefore, this
04:47 - is the same thing as two to the zero. So two
to the zero has to equal one in order to make
04:53 - it work with the quotient rule.
04:55 - And the same argument shows that anything
to the zero power
05:00 - has to be equal to one.
05:02 - What happens when we take something to a negative
power,
05:07 - x to the n is equal to one over x to the n.
Again, most people just take this as a definition
05:15 - of a negative exponent. But here's why it
makes sense.
05:20 - If I take something like five to seven times
five to the negative seven, then buy the product
05:26 - roll the SAS to equal five to the seven plus
negative seven, which is five to the zero,
05:33 - and we just said that that is equal to one.
05:35 - Now I have the equation of five to the seventh
times five to the negative seventh equals
05:41 - one, if I divide both sides by five, the seventh,
I get that five to the negative seventh has
05:47 - to equal one over five to the seventh. So
that's where this rule about negative exponents
05:52 - comes from. That has to be true in order to
be consistent with the product rule.
05:58 - Finally, let's look at a fractional exponents.
What does an expression like x to the one
06:03 - over N really mean? Well, it means the nth
root of x, for example, 64 to the 1/3 power
06:14 - means the cube root of 64, which happens to
be four, and nine to the one half means the
06:20 - square root of nine, which is usually written
without that little superscript up there.
06:26 - Now, the square root of nine is just three.
06:29 - fractional exponents also makes sense. For
example, if I have five to the 1/3, and I
06:39 - cube that, then by the power role, that's
equal to five to the 1/3, times three,
06:46 - which is just five to the one or five. So
in other words, five to the 1/3, is the number
06:55 - that when you cube it, you get five. And that's
exactly what's meant by the cube root of five,
07:01 - the cube root of five is also a number that
when you cube it, you get five.
07:07 - The next rule tells us we can distribute an
exponent over a product.
07:12 - In other words, if we have a product, x times
y, all raised to the nth power, that's equal
07:18 - to x to the n times y to the N.
07:22 - For example, five times seven,
07:27 - all raised to the third power is equal to
five cubed times seven cubed. And this makes
07:33 - sense, because five times seven, all raised
to the cube power can be expanded as five
07:39 - times seven, times five times seven, times
five times seven. But if I rearrange the order
07:46 - of multiplication, this is the same thing
as five times five times five, times seven
07:51 - times seven times seven, or five cubed times
seven cubed.
07:56 - Similarly, we could distribute an exponent
over a quotient, if we have the quotient X
08:02 - over Y, all raised to the n power, that's
the same as x to the n over y to the N. For
08:09 - example, two sevenths raised to the fifth
power is the same thing as two to the fifth
08:15 - over seven to the fifth. This makes sense,
because two sevens to the fifth can be expanded
08:23 - as two sevens multiply by itself five times,
which can be written rewritten as two multiplied
08:31 - by itself five times divided by seven multiplied
by itself five times, and that's two to the
08:37 - fifth, over seven to the fifth, as wanted.
08:43 - We've seen that we can distribute an exponent
08:47 - over multiplication, and division.
08:51 - But be careful, because we cannot distribute
next bowknot.
08:56 - over addition, or subtraction, for example,
a plus b to the n is not generally equal to
09:06 - a to the n plus b to the n, a minus b to the
n is not generally equal to a to the n minus
09:14 - b to the n. And if you're not sure, just try
an example with numbers.
09:19 - For example, two plus three squared is not
the same thing as two squared plus three squared,
09:28 - and two minus three squared is definitely
not equal to two squared minus three squared.
09:36 - In this video, I gave eight exponent rules,
which I'll list again here. There's the product
09:42 - rule,
09:43 - the quotient rule, the power rule,
09:46 - the zero exponent, the negative exponent,
the fractional exponent,
09:55 - and the two rules involving distributing exponents.
10:00 - Across multiplication,
10:02 - and division.
10:06 - In another video, I'll use these exponent
rules to rewrite and simplify expressions
10:11 - involving exponents.
10:13 - In this video, I'll work out some examples
of simplifying expressions using exponent
10:20 - rules.
10:21 - I'll start by reviewing the exponent rules.
10:22 - The product rule says that when you multiply
two expressions with the same base, you add
10:30 - the exponents. The quotient rule says that
when you divide two expressions with the same
10:36 - base, you subtract the exponents. The power
rule says that when you take a power to a
10:42 - power, you multiply the exponents. The power
of zero rule says that anything to the zero
10:50 - power is one, as long as the base is not zero.
10:54 - Since zero to the zero is undefined, it doesn't
make sense.
10:59 - negative exponents to evaluate x to the minus
n, we take the reciprocal one over x to the
11:07 - n. To evaluate a fractional exponent, like
x to the one over n, we take the nth root
11:16 - of x,
11:17 - we can distribute an exponent over a product,
a times b to the n is equal to A to the N
11:24 - times b to the n. And we can distribute an
exponent over a quotient a over b to the n
11:31 - is a to the n over b to the n.
11:36 - In the rest of this video, we'll use these
exponent rules to simplify expressions.
11:40 - For our first example, we want to simplify
three times x to the minus two divided by
11:47 - x to the fourth, there's several possible
ways to proceed.
11:51 - For example, we could use the negative exponent
rule dr x to the minus two as one over x squared,
12:00 - all that gets divided by x to the fourth,
still,
12:03 - notice that we only take the reciprocal of
the x squared, the three stays where it is.
12:09 - And that's because the exponent of negative
two only applies to the x not to the three.
12:16 - Now if we think of three as three over one,
we have a product of two fractions and our
12:23 - numerator. And so we evaluate that by taking
the product of the numerators times the product
12:30 - of the denominators, which is three over x
squared, all divided by x to the fourth,
12:36 - I can think of x to the fourth as x to the
fourth over one. So now I have a fraction
12:45 - of a fraction, which I can evaluate by multiplying
by the reciprocal, that simplifies to three
12:52 - times one divided by x squared times x to
the fourth, which is three over x to the six,
13:00 - using the product rule. Since x squared times
x to the fourth is equal to x to the two plus
13:07 - four, or x to the six.
13:12 - An alternate way of solving this problem
13:20 - is to start by using the quotient rule,
13:21 - I can rewrite this as three times x to the
minus two over x to the fourth, and by the
13:25 - quotient rule, that's three times x to the
minus two minus four, or three times x to
13:31 - the minus six.
13:32 - Now using the negative exponent roll, x to
the minus six is one over x to the six. And
13:40 - this product of fractions simplifies to three
over x to the six, the same answer I got before.
13:49 - The second problem can be solved in similar
ways. Please pause the video and try it before
14:00 - going on.
14:01 - One way to simplify would be to use the negative
exponent rule first, and rewrite y to the
14:04 - minus five as one over wide the fifth.
14:08 - thinking of this as a fraction, divided by
a fraction, I can multiply by the reciprocal
14:18 - and get four y cubed y to the fifth over one
by the product rule. The numerator here is
14:28 - four y to the eight. And so my final answer
is just for one of the eight.
14:35 - Alternatively, I could decide to use the quotient
rule first.
14:41 - As in the previous problem, I can write this
as for y cubed minus negative five by the
14:48 - quotient rule. And so that's for y to the
eighth as before.
14:53 - I'd like to show you one more method to solve
these two problems, kind of a shortcut method
14:59 - before we
15:00 - To go on, that shortcut relies on the principle
that a negative exponent in the numerator
15:08 - corresponds to a positive exponent in the
denominator. For example, the x to the negative
15:14 - two in the numerator here, after some manipulations
became an X to the positive two in the denominator.
15:22 - Furthermore, a negative exponent in the denominator
15:27 - is equivalent to a positive exponent in the
numerator.
15:32 - That's what happened when we had the y to
the negative five in the denominator, and
15:39 - translated into a y to the positive five in
the numerator.
15:42 - Sometimes people like to talk about this principle,
by saying that you can pass a factor
15:52 - across the fraction bar
15:54 - by switching the sine of the exponent that
is making a positive exponent negative, or
16:04 - a negative exponent positive.
16:07 - Let's see how this principle gives us a shortcut
for solving these two problems.
16:11 - In the first problem, 3x to the minus two
over x to the four, we can move the negative
16:20 - exponent in the numerator and make it a positive
exponent the denominator, so we get three
16:25 - over x to the four plus two or x to the six.
16:32 - In the second example, for y cubed over y
to the minus five, we can change the Y to
16:40 - the minus five in the denominator into a y
to the five in the numerator and get our final
16:45 - answer of four y to the three plus five or
eight.
16:51 - We'll use this principle again in the next
problems.
16:54 - In this example, notice that I have I have
y's in the numerator and the denominator,
17:01 - and also Z's in the numerator and the denominator.
In order to simplify, I'm going to try to
17:09 - get all my y's either in the numerator or
the denominator. And similarly for the Z's.
17:13 - Since I have more y's in the denominator,
let me move this y to the three downstairs
17:19 - and make it a y to the negative three. I'm
using the principle here that a positive exponent
17:26 - in the numerator corresponds to a negative
exponent in the denominator.
17:31 - Now since I have a positive exponent, z in
the numerator and a negative exponent denominator,
17:37 - and I want to get rid of negative exponents,
I'm going to pass the Z's to the numerator
17:44 - as e to the minus two in the denominator,
it comes as e to the plus two in the numerator.
17:51 - Notice that my number seven doesn't move.
And when I do any of these manipulations,
17:57 - because it doesn't have an exponent, and the
exponent of negative two, for example, only
17:59 - applies to the Z not to the seven.
18:01 - Now that I've got all my Z's in the numerator
and all my y's in the denominator, it's easy
18:10 - to clean this up using the product rule.
18:13 - And I have my simplified expression.
18:16 - In this last example, we have a complicated
expression raised to a fractional power.
18:22 - I'm going to start by simplifying the expression
inside the parentheses.
18:26 - I can bring all my y's downstairs and all
my x's upstairs and get rid of negative exponents
18:34 - at the same time.
18:35 - In other words, I can rewrite this as 25x
to the fourth,
18:40 - I'll bring the Y to the minus five downstairs
and make it y to the fifth on the denominator,
18:48 - bring the x to the minus six upstairs and
make it x to the sixth the numerator, and
18:54 - then I still have the Y cubed on the denominator,
all that's raised to the three halves power.
19:00 - Using the product rule, I can rewrite the
expression on the inside of the parentheses
19:07 - as 25x to the 10th over y to the eighth.
19:12 - Recall that we're allowed to distribute an
exponent across a product or across a quotient.
19:21 - When I distribute my three halves power,
19:27 - I get 25 to the three halves times x to the
10th to the three halves divided by y to the
19:36 - eighth to the three halves.
19:38 - Now the power rule tells me when I have a
power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents.
19:46 - So I can rewrite this as 25 to the three halves
times x to the 10 times three halves of our
19:53 - y to the eight times three halves. In other
words, 25 to the three halves times x to the
20:01 - 15th over y to the 12th. Finally, I need to
rewrite 25 to the three halves. Since three
20:10 - halves can be thought of as three times one
half, or as one half times three, I can write
20:17 - 25 to the three halves as 25 to the three
times one half, or as 25 to the one half times
20:27 - three.
20:28 - Well, using the power rule in reverse, I can
think of this as 25 cubed to the one half,
20:33 - or as 25 to the one half cubed. Since when
I take a power to a power, I multiply the
20:39 - exponents
20:40 - 25 cubed to the one half might be hard to
evaluate, since 25 cubed is a huge number,
20:47 - but 25 to the one half is just the square
root of 25. So I have the square root of 25
20:58 - cubed, or five cubed, which is 125.
21:02 - Therefore, my original expression is going
to be 120 5x to the 15 over y to the 12th.
21:09 - In this video, we use the exponent rules to
simplify complicated expressions.
21:18 - This video goes through a few tricks for simplifying
expressions with radicals in them.
21:23 - Recall that this notation means the nth root
of x, so this notation here means the cube
21:30 - root of eight, the number that when you cube
it, you get eight, that number would be two,
21:38 - when we write the root sign without a little
number, that just means the square root so
21:44 - the two is implied.
21:47 - In this case, the square root of 25 is five
since five squared is 25.
21:54 - Let's start by reviewing some rules for radical
expressions. First, if we have the radical
22:00 - of a product, we can rewrite that as the product
of two radicals.
22:06 - For example, the square root of nine times
16 is the same thing as the square root of
22:14 - nine times the square root of 16, you can
check that both of these evaluate to 12.
22:21 - Similarly, it's possible to distribute a radical
sine across division, the radical of a divided
22:29 - by b is the same thing as the radical of A
divided by the radical of B. For example,
22:37 - the cube root of 64 over eight is the same
thing as the cube root of 64 over the cube
22:45 - root of eight, and you can check that both
of these evaluated to
22:48 - you have to be a little bit careful though,
because it's not okay to distribute a radical
22:57 - sign across addition. In general, the nth
root of a plus b is not equal to the nth root
23:03 - of A plus the nth root of b. And similarly,
it's not okay to distribute a radical across
23:11 - subtraction.
23:14 - If you're ever in doubt, you can always check
with simple examples. For example, the square
23:19 - root of one plus one is not the same thing
as the square root of one plus the square
23:24 - root of one,
23:26 - the right side evaluates to one plus one or
two, and the left side is square root of two
23:32 - and the irrational number.
23:34 - The second expression to show that that fails,
I don't think it'll work to use the square
23:40 - root of one minus one it'll actually hold
in that case, but I can show it's false by
23:44 - using say the square root of two minus one,
which does not equal the square root of two
23:49 - minus the square root of one.
23:53 - You might notice that these Rules for Radicals,
the ones that hold and the ones that don't
23:57 - hold, remind you of rules for exponents. And
that's no coincidence. Because radicals can
24:04 - be written in terms of exponents. For example,
if we look at the first rule, we can rewrite
24:09 - this, the nth root of A times B is the same
thing as the one of our nth power. And by
24:19 - exponent rules, I can distribute an exponent
across multiplication. And so this radical
24:26 - rule can be restated completely in terms of
an exponent rule. Similarly, the second rule
24:34 - can be restated in terms of exponents as a
or b to the one over n is equal to A to the
24:41 - one over n divided by b to the one over n.
We can use the relationship between radicals
24:46 - and the exponents to rewrite a to the m over
n. a to the m over N is the same thing as
24:54 - a to the m with the N through taken. That's
also the same thing
25:00 - As the nth root of A, all taken to the nth
power to see whether that's true, think about
25:06 - exponent rules. So a to the m over N is the
same thing as a to the m, taken to the one
25:13 - over nth power. That's because when we take
a power to a power, we multiply exponents,
25:19 - and M times one over n is equal to M over
n.
25:25 - But a one over nth power is the same thing
as an nth root. And therefore, this expression
25:31 - is the same thing as this expression. And
that proves the first equivalence. The second
25:39 - equivalence can we prove similarly, by writing
a to the m over n as a to the one over n times
25:48 - M. Again, this is works because when I take
the power to the power, I'm multiply exponents,
25:55 - one over n times M is the same thing as M
over n. But now, these two expressions are
26:02 - the same, because the one over nth power is
the same as the nth root.
26:08 - One mnemonic for remembering these relationships
is flower over root. So flour is like power,
26:15 - and root is like root, so that tells us we
can write a fractional exponent, the M becomes
26:20 - the power, and the n becomes the root in either
of these two orders.
26:26 - Now let's use these rules in some examples.
If we want to compute 25 to the negative three
26:33 - halves power, well, first I'll use my exponent
rule to rewrite that negative exponent as
26:39 - one over 25 to the three halves power.
26:43 - Next, I'll use the power of a root mnemonic
to rewrite this as 25 to the third power square
26:52 - rooted, or, as 25 square rooted to the third
power.
26:59 - I wrote the two's there for the square root
for emphasis, but most of the time, people
27:04 - will omit this and just write the square root
without a little number there.
27:09 - Now, I could use either of these two equivalent
expressions to continue, but I'd rather use
27:15 - this one because it's easier to compute without
a calculator. The square root of 25 is just
27:20 - five, five cubed is 125. So my answer is one
over 125.
27:28 - If I tried to compute the cube of 25, first,
I'd get a huge number. In general, it's usually
27:34 - easier to compute the route before the power
when you're working without a calculator.
27:41 - Now let's do an example simplifying a more
complicated expression with with exponent
27:46 - cynet. I want to take the square root of all
this stuff. And since I don't really like
27:52 - negative exponents, I'm first going to rewrite
this as the square root of 60x squared y to
27:58 - the sixth over z to the 11th. So I'll change
that negative exponent to a positive exponent
28:04 - by moving this, this factor to the denominator.
28:07 - Now, when you're asked to simplify radical
expression, that generally means to pull as
28:13 - much as possible, out of the radical side.
28:17 - To pull things out of the square root side,
I'm going to factor my numbers and try to
28:23 - rewrite everything in terms of squares as
much as possible. Since the square root of
28:28 - a square, those two operations undo each other.
So I'll show you what I mean first, our factor
28:34 - 60. So 60 is going to be two squared times
three times five. And I'll just copy everything
28:43 - over for now.
28:47 - Now I'll break things up into squares as much
as possible. So I've got a two squared, and
28:52 - three times five, I've already got an x squared,
I write the wider the six as y squared times
28:57 - y squared times y squared. And I'll write
the Z to the 11th as z squared times z squared,
29:03 - I guess five times 12345 times when extra
z, that should add up to z to the 11th. I
29:12 - add all those exponents together.
29:15 - Now I know that I can distribute my radical
sign across multiplication and division. So
29:20 - I'll write this with a zillion different radicals
here.
29:25 - And every time I see the square root of something
squared, I can just cancel those square roots
29:32 - and the squares out and get what's what's
left here. So So after doing that cancellation,
29:37 - I get two times the square root of three times
five times x times y times y times y over
29:46 - z times itself, I guess five times times the
square root of z. And now I can clean that
29:53 - up with exponents. I'll write that as the
square root of 15 I guess two times a squared
29:59 - of 15
30:00 - times x times y cubed over z to the fifth
the square root of z.
30:07 - I'm gonna leave this example as is. But sometimes
people prefer to rewrite radical expressions
30:15 - without radical signs in the denominator.
That's called rationalizing the denominator.
30:20 - I won't do it here, but I'll show you how
to do it in the next example.
30:24 - This example asks us to rationalize the denominator,
that means to rewrite as an equivalent expression
30:31 - without radical signs in the denominator.
30:36 - To get rid of the radical sine and the denominator,
I want to multiply my denominator by square
30:44 - root of x. But I can't just multiply the denominator
willy nilly by something unless I multiply
30:49 - the numerator by the same thing. So then just
multiply my expression by one in a fancy forum
30:55 - and I don't change the value of my expression.
30:57 - Now, if I just multiply together numerators
3x squared of x and multiply denominators
31:06 - squared of x 10 squared of x is the square
root of x squared squared of x squared is
31:12 - just x.
31:14 - Now I can cancel my access from the numerator
denominator, and my final answer is three
31:19 - times the square root of x. I rationalize
my denominator, and the process got a nicer
31:24 - looking expression.
31:26 - In this video, we went over the Rules for
Radicals. And we simplified some radical expressions
31:34 - by working with fractional exponents,
31:37 - pulling things out of the radical sign
31:41 - and rationalizing the denominator.
31:46 - This video goes over some common methods of
factoring. Recall that factoring an expression
31:51 - means to write it as a product. So we could
factor the number 30, by writing it as six
31:56 - times five, we could factor it more completely
by writing it as two times three times five.
32:04 - As another example, we could factor the expression
x squared plus 5x plus six by writing it as
32:12 - x plus two times x plus three.
32:16 - In this video, I'll go over how I get from
here to here, how I know how to do the factoring.
32:23 - But for right now, I just want to review how
I can go backwards how I can check that the
32:29 - factoring is correct. And that's just by multiplying
out or distributing. If I distribute x plus
32:35 - two times x plus three, then I multiply x
by x, that gives me x squared, x times three
32:40 - gives me 3x. Two times x gives me 2x. And
two times three gives me six. So that simplifies
32:48 - to x squared plus 5x plus six, which checks
out with what I started with. So you can think
32:54 - of factoring as the opposite of distributing
out. And you can always check your factoring
33:00 - by distributing or multiplying out
33:01 - a bit of terminology, when I think of an expression
as a sum of a bunch of things, then the things
33:09 - I sum up are called the terms. But if I think
of the same expression as a product of things,
33:17 - then the things that I multiply together are
called factors.
33:22 - Now let's get started on techniques of factoring.
When I have to factor something, I always
33:28 - like to start by pulling out the greatest
common factor, the greatest common factor
33:33 - means the largest thing that divides each
of the terms.
33:38 - In this first example, the largest thing that
divides both 15 and 25x is five.
33:46 - So the GCF is five. So I pull the five out,
and then I divide each of the terms by that
33:53 - number. And so I get three plus 5x.
33:58 - Pause the video for a moment and see if you
can find the greatest common factor of x squared
34:04 - y and y squared x cubed.
34:08 - The biggest thing that divides both x squared
y and y squared x cubed is going to be x squared
34:15 - times y.
34:18 - One way to find this is to look for the power
of x that smallest in each of these terms.
34:24 - So that's x squared. And the power of y that
smallest in each of these terms is just y
34:29 - to the one or y.
34:31 - Now if I factor out the x squared y from each
of the terms, that's like dividing each term
34:38 - by x squared y, if I divide the first term
by x squared y, I just get one. If I divide
34:44 - the second term by x squared y, I'm going
to be left with an X and a Y. I'll write this
34:50 - out on the side just to make it more clear,
y squared x cubed over x squared y. That's
34:57 - like two y's on the end.
34:59 - Three x's on the top and two x's and a y on
the bottom. So I'm left with just an X and
35:07 - a Y. So I'll write the x, y here, and I factored
my expression. As always, I can check my answer
35:16 - by multiplying out. So if I multiply out my
factored expression, I get x squared y is
35:23 - the first term and the second term, I get
x there. Now let's see three X's multiplied
35:28 - together and two y's multiplied together.
And that checks out with what I started with.
35:35 - The next technique of factoring, I'd like
to go over his factoring by grouping. In this
35:40 - example, notice that we have four terms, factoring
by grouping is a handy method to look at.
35:46 - If you have four terms in your expression,
you need to factor
35:50 - in order to factor by grouping, I'm first
going to factor out the greatest common factor
35:56 - of the first two terms, and then separately,
factor out the greatest common factor of the
36:00 - last two terms. The greatest common factor
of x cubed, and 3x squared is x squared. So
36:08 - I factor out the x squared, and I get x plus
three. And now the greatest common factor
36:14 - of forex and 12 is just four. So I factor
out the four from those two terms.
36:23 - Notice that the factor of x plus three now
appears in both pieces. So I can factor out
36:31 - the greatest common factor of x plus three,
and I'll factor it out on the left side instead
36:36 - of the right. And now I have an x squared
from this first piece, and I have a four from
36:45 - this second piece. And that completes my factoring
by grouping. You might wonder if we could
36:52 - factor further by factoring the expression
x squared plus four. But in fact, as we'll
36:57 - see later, this expression, which is a sum
of two squares, x squared plus two squared
37:03 - does not factor any further over the integers.
37:06 - Next, we'll do some factoring of quadratics.
a quadratic is an expression with a squared
37:13 - term,
37:15 - just a term with x in it, and a constant term
with no x's in it.
37:20 - I'd like to factor this expression as a product
of x plus or minus some number times x plus
37:29 - or minus some other number.
37:32 - The key idea is that if I can find those two
numbers, then if I were to distribute out
37:37 - this expression, those two numbers would have
to multiply to give me my constant term of
37:41 - eight. And these two numbers would end up
having to add to give me my negative six,
37:48 - because when I multiply out, this number will
be a coefficient of x, and this number will
37:53 - be also another coefficient of x, they'll
add together to the negative six.
37:59 - So if I look at all the pairs of numbers that
multiply together to give me eight, so that
38:04 - could be one and eight, two, and four, four
and two, but that's really the same thing
38:11 - as I had before. And that's sort of the same
thing I had before. I shouldn't forget the
38:16 - negatives, I could have negative one, negative
eight, or I could have negative two, negative
38:20 - four, those alternate multiply together to
give me eight. Now I just have to find, see
38:25 - if there's a pair of these numbers that add
to negative six, and it's not hard to see
38:31 - that these ones will work. So now I can write
out my factoring as that would be x minus
38:39 - two times x minus four. And it's always a
good idea to check by multiplying out, I'm
38:45 - going to get x squared minus 4x minus 2x,
plus eight. And that works out to just what
38:53 - I want. Now this second examples a bit more
complicated, because now my leading coefficient,
39:00 - my coefficient of x squared is not just one,
it's the number 10.
39:04 - Now, there are lots of different methods for
approaching a problem like this. And I'm just
39:08 - going to show you one method, my favorite
method that uses factoring by grouping, but
39:13 - but to start out, I'm going to multiply my
coefficient of x squared by my constant term,
39:18 - so I'm multiplying 10 by negative six, that
gives me negative 60. And I'll also take my
39:25 - coefficient of x the number 11. And write
that down here. Now I'm going to look for
39:31 - two numbers that multiply to give me negative
60. And add to give me 11. You might notice
39:38 - that this is exactly what we were doing in
the previous problem. It's just here, we didn't
39:42 - have to multiply the coefficient of x squared
by eight, because the coefficient of x squared
39:47 - was just one. So to find the two numbers that
multiply to negative 60 and add to 11, you
39:53 - might just be able to come up with them in
your head thinking about it, but if not, you
39:58 - can figure it out. Pretty simple.
40:00 - thematically by writing out all the factors,
pairs of factors that multiply to negative
40:05 - 60. So I can start with negative one and 60,
negative two and 30, negative three and 20.
40:12 - And keep going like this until I have found
factors that actually add together to give
40:19 - me the number 11. And, and now that I look
at it, I've already found them. 15 minus four,
40:28 - gives me 11. So I don't have to continue with
my chart of factors. Now, once I found those
40:34 - factors, I write out my expression 10x squared,
but instead of writing 11x, I write negative
40:40 - 4x plus 15x. Now I copy down the negative
six, notice that negative 4x plus 15x equals
40:49 - 11x. That's how I chose those numbers. And
so this expression is evaluates is the same
40:55 - as, as this expression, I haven't changed
my expression. But I have turned it into something
41:01 - that I can apply factoring by grouping on
Look, I've got four terms here. And so if
41:05 - I factor out my greatest common factor of
my first two terms, that's let's see, I think
41:11 - it's 2x. So I factor out the 2x, I get 5x
minus two, and then I factor out the greatest
41:18 - common factor of 15x and negative six, that
would be three, and I get a 5x minus two,
41:25 - again, this is working beautifully. So I have
a 5x minus two in each part. And so I put
41:31 - the 5x minus two on the right, and I put what's
left from these terms in here. So that's 2x
41:38 - plus three. And I have factored my expression.
41:43 - There are a couple special kinds of expressions
that appear frequently, that it's handy to
41:50 - just memorize the formula for. So the first
one is the difference of squares. If you see
41:55 - something of the form a squared minus b squared,
then you can factor that as a plus b times
42:02 - a minus b. And let's just check that that
works. If I do a plus b times a minus b and
42:08 - multiply that out, I get a squared minus a
b plus b A minus B squared, and those middle
42:17 - two terms cancel out. So it gives me back
the difference of squares just like I want
42:21 - it. So for this first example, I if I think
of x squared minus 16 as x squared minus four
42:30 - squared, then I can see that's a difference
of squares. And I can immediately write it
42:34 - as x plus four times x minus four. And the
second example, nine p squared minus one,
42:41 - that's the same thing as three p squared minus
one squared. So that's three p plus one times
42:50 - three p minus one.
42:54 - Notice that if I have a sum of squares,
42:57 - for example,
43:01 - x squared plus four, which is x squared plus
two squared, then that does not factor.
43:09 - The difference of squares formula doesn't
apply. And there is no formula that applies
43:13 - for a sum of squares. There is, however, a
formula for both a difference of cubes and
43:19 - a sum of cubes. The difference of cubes formula,
a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times a
43:27 - squared plus a b plus b squared. The formula
for the sum of cubes is pretty much the same,
43:34 - you just switch the negative and positive
sign here in here. So that gives us a plus
43:41 - b times a squared minus a b plus b squared.
As usual, you can check these formulas by
43:49 - multiplying out. Let's look at one example
of using these formulas. Y cubed plus 27 is
43:55 - actually a sum of two cubes because it's y
cubed plus three cubed. So I can factor it
44:03 - using the sum of cubes formula by plugging
in y for a and three for B. That gives me
44:10 - y plus three times y squared minus y times
three plus three squared. And I can clean
44:18 - that up a little bit to read y plus three
times y squared minus three y plus nine.
44:23 - So in this video, we went over several methods
of factoring. We did factoring out the greatest
44:31 - common factor. We did factoring by grouping.
We did factoring quadratics. And we did a
44:40 - difference of squares. And we did a difference
and a psalm of cubes
44:47 - and more complicated problems, you may need
to apply several these techniques in order
44:54 - to get through a single problem. For example,
you might need to start by pulling out a greatest
44:58 - common factor and then
45:00 - Add to a factoring of quadratics, or something
similar.
45:03 - Now go forth and factor.
45:07 - This video gives some additional examples
of factoring. Please pause the video and decide
45:13 - which of these first five expressions factor
and which one does not.
45:20 - The first expression can be factored by pulling
out a common factor of x from each term.
45:27 - So that becomes x times x plus one.
45:34 - The second example can be factors as a difference
of two squares, since x squared minus 25 is
45:41 - something squared, minus something else squared.
And we know that anytime we have something
45:44 - like a squared minus b squared, that's a plus
b times a minus b. So we can factor this as
45:55 - X plus five times x minus five.
45:58 - The third one is a sum of two squares, there's
no way to factor a sum of two squares over
46:05 - real numbers. So this is the one that does
not factor.
46:09 - just for completeness, let's look at the next
to this next one does factor by grouping.
46:16 - When we factor by grouping, we pull up the
biggest common factor out of the first two
46:23 - terms, that would be an x squared, that becomes
x squared times x plus two. And then we factor
46:29 - as much as we can add the next two terms,
that would be a three times x plus two. Notice
46:36 - that the x plus two factor now occurs in both
of the resulting terms. So we can pull that
46:42 - x plus two out and get x plus two times x
squared plus three,
46:51 - we can't factor any further because x squared
plus three doesn't factor.
46:57 - Finally, we have a quadratic, this also factors.
And I like to factor these also using a factoring
47:04 - by grouping trick. So first, what I do is
I multiply the coefficient of x squared and
47:12 - the constant term, five times eight is 40.
I'll write that on the top of my x. Now I
47:19 - take the coefficient of the x term, that's
negative 14, and I write that on the bottom
47:24 - part of the x. Now I'm looking for two numbers
that multiply to 40 and add to negative 14.
47:32 - Sometimes I can just guess numbers like this,
but if not, I start writing out factors of
47:37 - 40. So factors of 40, I could do one times
40. Well, now I just noticed, I'm trying to
47:46 - add to a negative number. So if I use two
positive factors, there's no way there's going
47:51 - to add to a negative number. It's better for
me to use negative numbers, that factor 40,
47:56 - a negative times a negative still multiplies
to 40. But they have a chance of adding to
48:02 - a negative number. So but negative one and
negative 40, of course, don't work, they don't
48:06 - add to negative 14, they add to negative 41.
So let me try some other factors. The next
48:11 - biggest number that divides 40, besides one
is two, so I'll try negative two and negative
48:15 - 20. Those add to negative 22. That doesn't
work. Next one that divides 40 would be four,
48:22 - so I'll try negative four and negative 10.
Aha, we have a winner. So negative four plus
48:29 - negative 10 is negative 14, negative four
times negative 10 is positive 40. We've got
48:35 - it. Alright, so the next step is to use factoring
by grouping, we're going to first split up
48:41 - this negative 14x as negative 4x minus 10x.
And carry down the eight and the 5x squared.
48:50 - Notice that this works, because I picked negative
four and negative 10 to add up to negative
48:57 - 14, so so negative 4x minus 10x, will add
up to negative 14x. So I've got the same expression,
49:04 - just just expand it out a little bit. Now
I have four terms, I can do factoring by grouping,
49:09 - so I can group the first two terms and factor
out the biggest thing I can that will be n
49:13 - x times 5x minus four. And now I'll factor
the biggest thing I can out of these two numbers,
49:19 - including the the negative. So that becomes,
let's see, I can factor out a negative two
49:26 - and that becomes 5x minus four since negative
two times minus four is eight. All right,
49:33 - I've got the same 5x plus four in both my
terms, so factoring by grouping is going swimmingly,
49:40 - I can factor out the 5x minus four from both
those terms and I get the x minus two, and
49:45 - I factored this quadratic. If I want to, of
course, I can always check my work by distributing
49:51 - out by multiplying out. So a check here would
be multiplying 5x times x is 5x.
49:59 - squared 5x minus 10 to minus two is minus
10x minus four times x is minus 4x. And minus
50:08 - four times minus two is plus eight. So let's
see, this does check out to exactly what it
50:13 - should be. So that was the method of factoring
a quadratic.
50:22 - And all of these factors except for the sum
of squares.
50:27 - So we saw that factoring by grouping is handy
for factoring this expression here. It was
50:35 - also handy for factoring the quadratic indirectly,
after splitting up
50:39 - the middle term
50:44 - into two terms. So how can you tell when a
an expression is is appropriate to factor
50:52 - by grouping, there's, there's an easy way
to tell that it might be a candidate, and
50:57 - that's that it has four terms.
51:00 - So if you see four terms, or in the case of
quadratic, you can split it up into four terms,
51:05 - then that's a good candidate for factoring
by grouping because you can group the first
51:09 - two terms group the second two terms, factoring
by grouping all always work on, on expressions
51:16 - with four terms. But, but that's like the
first thing to look for. So let's just review
51:21 - what are the same main techniques of factoring.
We saw these on the previous page, we saw
51:25 - there was pull out common factors. There's
difference of squares.
51:32 - There's factoring by grouping.
51:36 - There's factoring quadratics.
51:41 - And one more that I didn't mention is factoring
sums and differences of cubes.
51:49 - that uses the formulas, aq minus b cubed is
a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b
51:57 - squared. And a cubed plus b cubed is a plus
b times a squared minus a b plus b squared.
52:07 - One important tip when factoring,
52:11 - I always recommend doing this first, pull
out the common factors first.
52:17 - That'll simplify things and making the rest
of factoring easier. One more tip is that
52:21 - you might need to do several these factoring
techniques in one problem, for example,
52:28 - you might have to first pull out a common
factor, then factor a difference of squares.
52:31 - And then you might notice that one of your
factors is itself a difference of squares,
52:35 - and you have to apply a difference of squares
again, so don't stop when you factor a little
52:41 - bit, keep factoring as far as you can go.
52:43 - Here are some extra examples of factoring
quadratics. For you to practice, please pause
52:49 - the video and give these a try.
52:52 - For the first one, let's multiply two times
negative 14. That gives us negative 28. And
53:01 - then we'll bring the three down in the bottom
of the x. Now we're looking for two numbers
53:06 - that multiply to negative 28 and add to three.
Well, to multiply two numbers to get a negative
53:14 - 28, we'll need one of them to be negative
and one of them to be positive. So to be one,
53:23 - negative 128, or one, negative 28, those don't
work. Let's see negative 214 or two, negative
53:26 - 14, those don't work. Hey, I just noticed
the positive number had better be bigger than
53:30 - the negative number, so they add to a positive
number. Let's see what comes next. How about
53:37 - negative four times seven, four times negative
seven, I think four, negative four times seven
53:43 - will work. So I'll write those here at negative
four, seven,
53:49 - copy down the two z squared. And I'll split
up the three z into negative four z plus seven
53:58 - z and then minus 14. Now factoring by grouping,
pull out a to z, that becomes z minus two,
54:05 - pull out a seven and that becomes z minus
two again, looking good. I've got two z plus
54:12 - seven times z minus two as my factored expression.
54:18 - My second expression, I could work at the
same way, drawing my axe and factoring by
54:23 - grouping that kind of thing. But it's actually
going to be easier if I notice first that
54:28 - I can pull out a common factor from all of
my terms, though, that'll make things a lot
54:32 - simpler to deal with. So notice that a five
divides each of these terms, and in fact,
54:36 - I'm going to go ahead and pull out the negative
five because I don't like having negatives
54:39 - in front of my squared term. So I'm going
to pull out a common factor of negative five.
54:44 - Again, it would work if I forgot to do this,
but it would be a lot more complicated. So
54:49 - negative five v squared, this becomes minus,
this becomes plus nine V, since nine times
54:56 - negative five is negative 45. And this becomes
minus
54:59 - 10 cents native 10 times negative five is
positive 50. Now I can start my x and my factoring
55:06 - by grouping, or I can use kind of a shortcut
method, which you may have seen before. So
55:10 - I can just put these here, and then I know
that whatever numbers go here, they're gonna
55:15 - have to multiply to the negative 10. And they're
gonna have to add to the nine. So that would
55:21 - be plus 10, and a minus one will do the trick.
55:26 - Those are all my factoring examples for today.
I hope you enjoy your snow morning and have
55:32 - a chance to spend some time working in ALEKS.
Bye.
55:37 - This video is about working with rational
expressions. A rational expression is a fraction
55:43 - usually with variables in it, something like
x plus two over x squared minus three is a
55:49 - rational expression. In this video, we'll
practice adding, subtracting, multiplying
55:55 - and dividing rational expressions and simplifying
them to lowest terms.
56:01 - We'll start with simplifying to lowest terms.
Recall that if you have a fraction with just
56:07 - numbers in it, something like 21 over 45,
we can reduce it to lowest terms by factoring
56:14 - the numerator
56:17 - and factoring the denominator
56:22 - and then canceling common factors.
56:26 - So in this example, the three is cancel, and
our fraction reduces to seven over 15.
56:35 - If we want to reduce a rational expression
with the variables and add to lowest terms,
56:40 - we proceed the same way. First, we'll factor
the numerator, that's three times x plus two,
56:47 - and then factor the denominator. In this case
of factors 2x plus two times x plus two, we
56:54 - could also write that as x plus two squared.
Now we cancel the common factors. And we're
57:00 - left with three over x plus two. Definitely
a simpler way of writing that rational expression.
57:08 - Next, let's practice multiplying and dividing.
Recall that if we multiply two fractions with
57:15 - just numbers in them, we simply multiply the
numerators and multiply the denominators.
57:20 - So in this case, we would get four times two
over three times five or 8/15.
57:28 - If we want to divide two fractions, like in
the second example, then we can rewrite it
57:35 - as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction
on the denominator. So here, we get four fifths
57:43 - times three halves, and that gives us 12 tenths.
But actually, we could reduce that fraction
57:50 - to six fifths,
57:53 - we use the same rules when we compute the
product or quotient of two rational expressions
58:00 - with the variables. And then here, we're trying
to divide two rational expressions. So instead,
58:06 - we can multiply by the reciprocal. I call
this flipping and multiplying.
58:12 - And now we just multiply the numerators.
58:18 - And multiply the denominators.
58:21 - It might be tempting at this point to multiply
out to distribute out the numerator and the
58:28 - denominator. But actually, it's better to
leave it in this factored form and factored
58:32 - even more completely. That way, we'll be able
to reduce the rational expression to cancel
58:38 - the common factors. So let's factor even more
the x squared plus x factors as x times x
58:46 - plus one, and x squared minus 16. And that's
a difference of two squares, that's x plus
58:52 - four times x minus four, the denominator is
already fully factored, so we'll just copy
58:59 - it over. And now we can cancel common factors
here and here, and we're left with x times
59:06 - x minus four. This is our final answer.
59:12 - Adding and subtracting fractions is a little
more complicated because we first have to
59:16 - find a common denominator. A common denominator
is an expression that both denominators divided
59:23 - into, it's usually best of the long run to
use the least common denominator, which is
59:29 - the smallest expression that both denominators
divided into.
59:34 - In this example, if we just want a common
denominator, we could use six times 15, which
59:39 - is 90 because both six and 15 divided evenly
into 90. But if we want the least common denominator,
59:46 - the best way to do that is to factor the two
denominators. So six is two times 315 is three
59:55 - times five, and then put together only the
factors we need for
59:59 - Both six and 50 into divider numbers. So if
we just use two times three times five, which
60:07 - is 30, we know that two times three will divide
it, and three times five will also divide
60:14 - it. And we won't be able to get a denominator
any smaller, because we need the factors two,
60:19 - three, and five, in order to ensure both these
numbers divided. Once we have our least common
60:24 - denominator, we can rewrite each of our fractions
in terms of that denominator. So seven, six,
60:31 - I need to get a 30 in the denominator, so
I'm going to multiply that by five over five,
60:38 - and multiply by the factors that are missing
from the current denominator in order to get
60:45 - my least common denominator of 30. For the
second fraction, for 15th 15 times two is
60:54 - 30. So I'm going to multiply by two over two,
60:57 - I can rewrite this as 3530 s minus 8/30. And
now that I have a common denominator, I can
61:08 - just subtract my two numerators. And I get
27/30.
61:15 - If I factor, I can reduce this
61:20 - to three squared over two times five, which
is nine tenths. The process for finding the
61:28 - sum of two rational expressions with variables
in them follows the exact same process. First,
61:33 - we have to find the least common denominator,
I'll do that by factoring the two denominators.
61:39 - So 2x plus two factors as two times x plus
1x squared minus one, that's a difference
61:45 - of two squares. So that's x plus one times
x minus one. Now for the least common denominator,
61:51 - I'm going to take all the factors, I need
to get an expression that each of these divides
61:57 - into, so I need the factor two, I need the
factor x plus one, and I need the factor x
62:02 - minus one, I don't have to repeat the factor
x plus one I just need to have at one time.
62:08 - And so I will get my least common denominator
two times x plus one times x minus one, I'm
62:14 - not going to bother multiplying this out,
it's actually better to leave it in factored
62:17 - form to help me simplify later. Now I can
rewrite each of my two rational expressions
62:24 - by multiplying by whatever's missing from
the denominator in terms of the least common
62:29 - denominator. So what I mean is, I can rewrite
three over 2x plus two, I'll write the 2x
62:36 - plus two is two times x plus one, I'll write
it in factored form. And then I noticed that
62:41 - compared to the least common denominator,
I'm missing the factor of x minus one. So
62:45 - I multiply the numerator and the denominator
by x minus one, I just need it in the denominator.
62:52 - But I can't get away with just multiplying
by the denominator without changing my expression,
62:56 - I have to multiply by it on the numerator
and the denominator. So I'm just multiplying
63:00 - by one and a fancy form and not changing the
value here. So now I do the same thing for
63:06 - the second rational expression, I'll I'll
write the denominator in factored form to
63:10 - make it easier to see what's missing from
the denominator. What's missing in this denominator,
63:16 - compared to my least common denominator is
just the factor two, so multiply the numerator
63:21 - and the denominator by two. Now I can rewrite
everything. So the first rational expression
63:27 - becomes three times x minus one over two times
x plus 1x minus one, and the second one becomes
63:36 - five times two over two times x plus 1x minus
one, notice that I now have a common denominator.
63:44 - So I can just add together my numerators.
So I get three times x minus one plus 10 over
63:51 - two times x plus 1x minus one. I'd like to
simplify this. And the best way to do that
63:58 - is to leave the denominator in factored form.
But I do have to multiply out the numerator
64:04 - so that I can add things together. So I get
3x minus three plus 10 over two times x plus
64:12 - 1x minus one, or 3x plus seven over two times
x plus 1x minus one. Now 3x plus seven doesn't
64:22 - factor. And there's therefore no factors that
I can cancel out. So this is already reduced.
64:29 - As much as it can be. This is my final answer.
64:33 - In this video, we saw how to simplify rational
expressions to lowest terms by factoring and
64:40 - canceling common factors.
64:42 - We also saw how to multiply rational expressions
by multiplying the numerator and multiplying
64:47 - the denominator, how to divide rational expressions
by flipping and multiplying and how to add
64:53 - and subtract rational expressions by writing
them in terms of the least common denominator
65:00 - This video is about solving quadratic equations.
a quadratic equation is an equation that contains
65:07 - the square of the variable, say x squared,
but no higher powers of x.
65:11 - The standard form for a quadratic equation
is the form a x squared plus b x plus c equals
65:20 - zero, where A, B and C
65:25 - represent real numbers. And a is not zero
so that we actually have an x squared term.
65:31 - Let me give you an example. 3x squared plus
7x minus two equals zero is a quadratic equation
65:40 - in standard form, here a is three, B is seven,
and C is minus two. The equation 3x squared
65:49 - equals minus 7x plus two is also a quadratic
equation, it's just not in standard form.
65:56 - The key steps to solving quadratic equations
are usually to write the equation in standard
66:02 - form, and then either factor it
66:07 - or use the quadratic formula, which I'll show
you later in this video.
66:14 - Let's start with the example y squared equals
18 minus seven y. Here our variable is y,
66:21 - and we need to rewrite this quadratic equation
in standard form, we can do this by subtracting
66:26 - 18 from both sides and adding seven y to both
sides. That gives us the equation y squared
66:33 - minus 18 plus seven y equals zero. And I can
rearrange a little bit to get y squared plus
66:40 - seven y minus 18 equals zero. Now I've got
my equation in standard form. Next, I'm going
66:48 - to try to factor it. So I need to look for
two numbers that multiply to negative 18 and
66:54 - add to seven.
66:57 - two numbers that work are nine and negative
two, so I can factor my expression on the
67:02 - left as y plus nine times y minus two equals
zero. Now, anytime you have two quantities
67:12 - that multiply together to give you zero, either
the first quantity has to be zero, or the
67:17 - second quantity has to be zero, or I suppose
they both could be zero. In some situations,
67:22 - this is really handy, because that means that
I know that either y plus nine equals zero,
67:27 - or y minus two equals zero. So I can as my
next step, set my factors equal to zero. So
67:36 - y plus nine equals zero, or y minus two equals
zero, which means that y equals negative nine,
67:43 - or y equals two.
67:46 - It's not a bad idea to check that those answers
actually work by plugging them into the original
67:51 - equation, negative nine squared, does that
equal 18 minus seven times negative nine,
67:56 - and you can work out that it does. And similarly,
two squared equals 18 minus seven times two.
68:04 - In the next example, let's find solutions
of the equation w squared equals 121. This
68:11 - is a quadratic equation, because it's got
a square of my variable W, I can rewrite it
68:17 - in standard form by subtracting 121 from both
sides.
68:24 - Notice that A is equal to one b is equal to
zero because there's no w term, and c is equal
68:31 - to negative 121 in the standard form, a W
squared plus BW plus c equals zero. Next step,
68:39 - I'm going to try to factor this expression.
So since 121, is 11 squared, this is a difference
68:47 - of two squares, and it factors as w plus 11,
times w minus 11 is equal to zero. If I set
68:56 - the factors equal to zero,
68:59 - I get w plus 11 equals zero or w minus 11
equals zero. So w equals minus 11, or w equals
69:07 - 11. In this example, I could have solved the
equation more simply, I could have instead
69:14 - said that if W squared is 121, and then w
has to equal plus or minus the square root
69:20 - of 121. In other words, W is plus or minus
11.
69:26 - If you saw the equation this way, it's important
to remember the plus or minus since minus
69:30 - 11 squared equals 121, just like 11 squared
does.
69:36 - Now let's find the solutions for the equation.
x times x plus two equals seven. Some people
69:41 - might be tempted to say that, oh, if two numbers
multiply to equal seven, then one of them
69:46 - better equal one and the other equals seven
or maybe negative one and negative seven.
69:51 - But that's faulty reasoning in this case,
because x and x plus two don't have to be
69:57 - whole numbers. They could be crazy.
70:00 - fractions or even irrational numbers. So instead,
let's rewrite this equation in standard form.
70:08 - To do that, I'm first going to multiply out.
So x times x is x squared x times two is 2x.
70:16 - That equals seven, and I'll subtract the seven
from both sides to get x squared plus 2x minus
70:23 - seven is zero. Now I'm looking to factor it.
So I need two numbers that multiply to negative
70:28 - seven and add to two, since the only way to
factor negative seven is as negative one times
70:34 - seven or seven times negative one, it's easy
to see that there are no whole numbers that
70:39 - will do will work. So there's no way to factor
this expression over the integers. Instead,
70:46 - let's use the quadratic equation. So we have
our leading coefficient of x squared is one.
70:53 - So A is one, B is two, and C is minus seven.
And we're going to plug that into the equation
71:00 - quadratic equation, which goes x equals negative
b plus or minus the square root of b squared
71:06 - minus four, I see all over two
71:10 - different people have different ways of remembering
this formula, I'd like to remember it by seeing
71:15 - it x equals negative b plus or minus the square
root of b squared minus four, I see oh over
71:22 - to a, but you can use any pneumonic you like.
Anyway, plugging in here, we have x equals
71:28 - negative two plus or minus the square root
of two squared minus four times one times
71:34 - negative seven support and remember the negative
seven there to all over two times one.
71:40 - Now two squared is four, and four times one
times negative seven is negative 28. So this
71:48 - whole quantity under the square root sign
becomes four minus negative 28, or 32. So
71:55 - I can rewrite this as x equals negative two
plus or minus the square root of 32, all over
72:00 - two.
72:01 - Since 32, is 16 times two and 16 is a perfect
square, I can rewrite this as negative two
72:11 - plus or minus the square root of 16 times
the square root of two over two, which is
72:15 - negative two plus or minus four times the
square root of two over two.
72:19 - Next, I'm going to split out my fraction
72:26 - as negative two over two plus or minus four
square root of two over two, and then simplify
72:32 - those fractions. This becomes negative one
plus or minus two square root of two. So my
72:38 - answers are negative one plus two square root
of two and negative one minus two square root
72:45 - of two. And if I need a decimal answer for
any reason, I could work this out on my calculator.
72:52 - As our final example, let's find all real
solutions for the equation, one half y squared
72:57 - equals 1/3 y minus two. I'll start as usual
by putting it in standard form. So that gives
73:04 - me one half y squared minus 1/3 y plus two
equals zero, I could go ahead and start trying
73:12 - to factor or use the quadratic formula right
now. But I find fractional coefficients kind
73:17 - of annoying. So I'd like to get rid of them.
By doing what I call clearing the denominator,
73:22 - that means I'm going to multiply the whole
entire equation by the least common denominator.
73:27 - In this case, the least common denominator
is two times three or six. So I'll multiply
73:33 - the whole equation by six have to make sure
I multiplied both sides of the equation, but
73:37 - in this case, six times zero is just zero.
And when I distribute the six, I get three
73:42 - y squared minus two y plus 12 equals zero.
73:47 - Now, I could try to factor this, but I think
it's easier probably just to plunge in and
73:51 - use the quadratic formula.
73:54 - So I get x equals negative B, that's negative
negative two or two, plus or minus the square
74:01 - root of b squared, minus four times a times
c, all over to a.
74:12 - Working out the stuff in a square root sign,
negative two squared is four. And here we
74:17 - have, let's see 144.
74:21 - So this simplifies to x equals to plus or
minus the square root of four minus 144. That's
74:28 - negative 140. All of our sex. Well, if you're
concerned about that negative number under
74:35 - the square root sign, you should be we can't
take the square root of a negative number
74:40 - and get an N get a real number is our answer.
There's no real number whose square is a negative
74:45 - number. And therefore, our conclusion is we
have no real solutions to this quadratic equation.
74:54 - In this video, we solve some quadratic equations
by first writing them in standard form and
74:59 - then
75:00 - Either factoring or using the quadratic formula.
75:03 - In some examples, factoring doesn't work,
it's not possible to factor the equation.
75:08 - But in fact, using the quadratic formula will
always work even if it's also possible to
75:13 - solve it by factoring. So you can't really
lose by using the quadratic formula. It's
75:19 - just sometimes it'll be faster to factor instead.
75:23 - This video is about solving rational equations.
A rational equation, like this one is an equation
75:29 - that has rational expressions in that, in
other words, an equation that has some variables
75:34 - in the denominator.
75:35 - There are several different approaches for
solving a rational equation, but they all
75:41 - start by finding the least common denominator.
In this example, the denominators are x plus
75:46 - three and x, we can think of one as just having
a denominator of one.
75:52 - Since the denominators don't have any factors
in common, I can find the least common denominator
75:57 - just by multiplying them together.
76:00 - My next step is going to be clearing the denominator.
76:04 - By this, I mean that I multiply both sides
of my equation by this least common denominator,
76:12 - x plus three times x, I multiply on the left
side of the equation, and I multiply by the
76:19 - same thing on the right side of the equation.
76:22 - Since I'm doing the same thing to both sides
of the equation, I don't change the the value
76:28 - of the equation. Multiplying the least common
denominator on both sides of the equation
76:33 - is equivalent to multiplying it by all three
terms in the equation, I can see this when
76:38 - I multiply out,
76:41 - I'll rewrite the left side the same as before,
pretty much. And then I'll distribute the
76:47 - right side to get x plus three times x times
one plus x plus three times x times one over
76:56 - x. So I've actually multiplied the least common
denominator by all three terms of my equation.
77:01 - Now I can have a blast canceling things. The
x plus three cancels with the x plus three
77:07 - on the denominator.
77:10 - The here are nothing cancels out because there's
no denominator, and here are the x in the
77:15 - numerator cancels with the x in the denominator.
77:18 - So I can rewrite my expression as x squared
equals x plus three times x times one plus
77:26 - x plus three. Now I'm going to simplify.
77:29 - So I'll leave the x squared alone on this
side, I'll distribute out x squared plus 3x
77:36 - plus x plus three, hey, look, the x squared
is cancel on both sides. And so I get zero
77:44 - equals 4x plus three, so 4x is negative three,
and x is negative three fourths. Finally,
77:51 - I'm going to plug in my answer to check. This
is a good idea for any kind of equation. But
77:57 - it's especially important for a rational equation
because occasionally for rational equations,
78:01 - you'll get what's called extraneous solution
solutions that don't actually work in your
78:05 - original equation because they make the denominator
zero. Now, in this example, I don't think
78:09 - we're going to get any extraneous equations
because negative three fourths is not going
78:16 - to make any of these denominators zero, so
it should work out fine when I plug in. If
78:20 - I plug in,
78:22 - I get this, I can simplify
78:29 - the denominator here, negative three fourths
plus three, three is 12 fourths, as becomes
78:34 - nine fourths. And this is one I'll flip and
multiply to get minus four thirds. So here,
78:42 - I can simplify my complex fraction, it ends
up being negative three nights, and one minus
78:49 - four thirds is negative 1/3. So that all seems
to check out.
78:55 - And so my final answer is x equals negative
three fourths.
79:00 - This next example looks a little trickier.
And it is, but the same approach will work.
79:05 - First off, find the least common denominator.
So here, my denominators are c minus five,
79:13 - c plus one, and C squared minus four c minus
five, I'm going to factor that as C minus
79:22 - five times c plus one. Now, my least common
denominator needs to have just enough factors
79:29 - to that each of these denominators divided
into it. So I need the factor c minus five,
79:35 - I need the factor c plus one. And now I've
already got all the factors I need for this
79:39 - denominator. So here is my least common denominator.
Next step is to clear the denominators.
79:47 - So I do this by multiplying both sides of
the equation by my least common denominator.
79:53 - In fact, I can just multiply each of the three
terms by this least common denominator
80:01 - I went ahead and wrote my third denominator
in factored form to make it easier to see
80:06 - what cancels. Now canceling time dies, this
dies. And both of those factors die. cancelling
80:16 - out the denominator is the whole point of
multiplying by the least common denominator,
80:21 - you're multiplying by something that's big
enough to kill every single denominator, so
80:25 - you don't have to deal with denominators anymore.
80:28 - Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out.
80:32 - So I get, let's see, c plus one times four
c, that's four c squared plus four c, now
80:41 - I get minus just c minus five, and then over
here, I get three c squared plus three,
80:51 - I can rewrite the minus quantity c minus five
is minus c plus five.
81:00 - And now I can subtract the three c squared
from both sides to get just a C squared over
81:06 - here, and the four c minus c that becomes
a three C.
81:15 - And finally, I can subtract the three from
both sides to get c squared plus three c plus
81:21 - two equals zero. got myself a quadratic equation
that looks like a nice one that factors. So
81:28 - this factors to C plus one times c plus two
equals zero. So either c plus one is zero,
81:36 - or C plus two is zero. So C equals negative
one, or C equals negative two.
81:44 - Now let's see, we need to still check our
answers.
81:49 - Without even going to the trouble of calculating
anything, I can see that C equals negative
81:54 - one is not going to work, because if I plug
it in to this denominator here, I get a denominator
82:01 - zero, which doesn't make sense. So C equals
minus one is an extraneous solution, it doesn't
82:09 - actually satisfy my original equation. And
so I can just cross it right out, C equals
82:16 - negative two.
82:19 - I can go if I go ahead, and that doesn't make
any of my denominators zero. So if I haven't
82:23 - made any mistakes, it should satisfy my original
equation, but, but I'll just plug it in to
82:30 - be sure.
82:33 - And after some simplifying,
82:36 - I get a true statement.
82:39 - So my final answer is C equals negative two.
In this video, we saw the couple of rational
82:46 - equations using the method of finding the
least common denominator and then clearing
82:53 - the denominator,
82:55 - we cleared the denominator by multiplying
both sides of the equation by the least common
82:59 - denominator or equivalently. multiplying each
of the terms by that denominator.
83:04 - There's another equivalent method that some
people prefer, it still starts out the same,
83:10 - we find the least common denominator, but
then we write all the fractions
83:16 - over that least common denominator. So in
this example, we'd still use the least common
83:22 - denominator of x plus three times x. But our
next step would be to write each of these
83:27 - rational expressions over that common denominator
by multiplying the top and the bottom by the
83:32 - appropriate things. So one, in order to get
the common denominator of x plus 3x, I need
83:38 - to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus
three times x, one over x, I need to multiply
83:44 - the top and the bottom just by x plus three
since that's what's missing from the denominator
83:49 - x. Now, if I simplify a little bit,
83:53 - let's say this is x squared over that common
denominator, and
84:00 - here I have just x plus three times x over
that denominator, and here I have x plus three
84:09 - over that common denominator. Now add together
my fractions on the right side, so they have
84:17 - a common denominator.
84:18 - So this is x plus three times x plus x plus
three. And now I have two fractions that have
84:27 - that are equal that have the same denominator,
therefore their numerators have to be equal
84:32 - also. So the next step is to set the numerators
equal.
84:37 - So I get x squared is x plus three times x
plus x plus three. And if you look back at
84:46 - the previous way, we solve this equation,
you'll recognize this equation. And so from
84:52 - here on we just continue as before.
84:57 - When choosing between these two methods, I
personally tend
85:00 - prefer the clear the denominators method,
because it's a little bit less writing, you
85:03 - don't have to get rid of those denominators
earlier, you don't have to write them as many
85:07 - times. But some people find this one a little
bit easier to remember, a little easier to
85:12 - understand either of these methods is fine.
85:15 - One last caution, don't forget at the end,
to check your solutions and eliminate any
85:21 - extraneous solutions.
85:23 - These will be solutions that make the denominators
of your original equations go to zero.
85:30 - This video is about solving radical equations,
that is equations like this one that have
85:36 - square root signs in them, or cube roots or
any other kind of radical.
85:40 - When I see an equation with a square root
in it, I really want to get rid of the square
85:45 - root. But it'll be easiest to get rid of the
square root. If I first isolate the square
85:51 - root. In other words, I want to get the term
with the square root and that on one side
85:56 - of the equation by itself, and everything
else on the other side of the equation. If
86:01 - I start with my original equation, x plus
the square root of x equals 12. And I subtract
86:07 - x from both sides, then that does isolate
the square root term on the left side with
86:12 - everything else on the right. Once I've isolated
the term with the square root, I want to get
86:19 - rid of the square root. And I'll do that by
squaring both sides
86:27 - of my equation. So I'll take the square root
of x equals 12 minus x and square both sides.
86:36 - Now the square root of x squared is just x,
taking the square root and then squaring those
86:42 - operations undo each other
86:45 - to work out 12 minus x squared, write it out
and distribute 12 times 12 is 144 12 times
86:54 - minus x is minus 12x. I get another minus
12x from here.
87:02 - And finally minus x times minus x is positive
x squared. So I can combine my minus 12 x's,
87:09 - that's minus 24x. And now I can subtract x
from both sides to get zero equals 144 minus
87:18 - 25x plus x squared. That's a quadratic equation,
I'll rewrite it in a little bit more standard
87:26 - form here.
87:27 - So now I've got a familiar quadratic equation
with no radical signs left in my equation,
87:34 - I'll just proceed to solve it like I usually
do for a quadratic, I'll try to factor it.
87:38 - So I'm going to look for two numbers that
multiply to 144 and add to minus 25. I know
87:46 - I'm going to need negative numbers to get
to negative 25. And in fact, I'll need two
87:53 - negative numbers. So they still multiply to
a positive number. So I'll start listing some
87:57 - factors of 144, I could have negative one
and a negative 144, negative two, and negative
88:04 - 72, negative four, negative 36, and so on.
Once I've listed out the possible factors,
88:12 - it's not hard to find the two that add to
negative 25. So that's negative nine and negative
88:17 - 16. So now I can factor in my quadratic equation
as x minus nine times x minus 16 equals zero,
88:28 - that means that x minus nine is zero or x
minus 16 is zero. So x equals nine or x equals
88:34 - 16. I'm almost done. But there's one last
very important step. And that's to check the
88:41 - Solutions so that we can eliminate any extraneous
solutions and extraneous solution as a solution
88:49 - that we get that does not actually satisfy
our original equation and extraneous solutions
88:54 - can happen when you're solving equations with
radicals in them. So let's first check x equals
89:00 - nine. If we plug in to our original equation,
we get nine plus a squared of nine and we
89:06 - want that to equal 12. Well, the square root
of nine is three, and nine plus three does
89:11 - indeed equal 12. So that solution checks out.
Now, let's try x equals 16. Plugging in, we
89:18 - get 16 plus a squared of 16. And that's supposed
to equal 12. Well, that says 16 plus four
89:25 - is supposed to equal 12. But that most definitely
is not true. And so x equals 16. Turns out
89:31 - to be extraneous solution, and our only solution
is x equals nine
89:47 - This next equation might not look like an
equation involving radicals. But in fact,
90:26 - we can think of a fractional exponent as being
a radical in disguise. Let's start by doing
90:32 - the same thing we did on the previous problem
by isolating This time, we'll isolate the
90:38 - part of the equation
90:41 - that involves the fractional exponent. So
I'll start with the original equation, two
90:46 - times P to the four fifths equals 1/8. And
I'll divide both sides by two or equivalently,
90:53 - I can multiply both sides by one half, that
gives me p to the four fifths equals 1/16.
91:00 - And I've effectively isolated the part of
the equation with the fractional exponent
91:05 - as much as possible. Now, in the previous
example, the next step was to get rid of the
91:12 - radical. In this example, we're going to get
rid of the fractional exponent. And I'm going
91:18 - to actually do this in two stages. First,
I'm going to raise both sides to the fifth
91:24 - power.
91:26 - That's because when I take an exponent to
an exponent, I'm multiply my exponents. And
91:34 - so that becomes just p to the fourth equals
1/16 to the fifth power. Now, I'm going to
91:41 - get rid of the fourth power by raising both
sides to the 1/4 power, or by taking the fourth
91:48 - root, there's something that you need to be
careful about though, when taking
91:53 - an even root, or the one over an even number
power, you always have to consider plus or
92:01 - minus your answer.
92:04 - It's kind of like when you write x squared
equals four, and you take the square root
92:10 - of both sides, x could equal plus or minus
the square root of four, right, x could equal
92:16 - plus or minus two, since minus two squared
is four, just as well as two squared. So that's
92:23 - why when you take an even root, or a one over
an even power of both sides, you always need
92:32 - to include the plus or minus sign, when it's
an odd root or one over an odd power, you
92:39 - don't need to do that. If you had something
like x cubed equals negative eight, then x
92:46 - equals the cube root of negative eight, which
is negative two would be your only solution,
92:51 - you don't need to do the plus or minus because
positive two wouldn't work.
92:55 - So that aside, explains why we need this plus
or minus power. And now p to the four to the
93:02 - 1/4. When I raise a power to a power, I multiply
by exponents, so that's just p to the one,
93:09 - which is equal to plus or minus 1/16 to the
fifth power to the 1/4 power.
93:17 - Now I just need to simplify this expression,
I don't really want to raise 1/16 to the fifth
93:23 - power, because 16 to the fifth power is like
a really huge number. So I think I'm actually
93:28 - going to rewrite this first
93:32 - as P equals plus or minus 1/16. I'll write
it back as the 5/4 power again.
93:42 - And as I continue to solve using my exponent
rules,
93:49 - I'm going to prefer to write this as 1/16
to the fourth root to the fifth power, because
93:58 - it's going to be easier to take the fourth
root, let's see the fourth root of 1/16 is
94:03 - the same thing as the fourth root of one over
the fourth root of 16. Raise all that to the
94:08 - fifth power. fourth root of one is just one
and the fourth root of 16 is to raise that
94:14 - to the fifth power, that's just going to be
one to the fifth over two to the fifth, which
94:19 - is plus or minus 130 seconds.
94:24 - The last step is to check answers.
94:28 - So I have the two answers p equals 130 seconds,
and P equals minus 130 seconds. And if I plug
94:35 - those both in
94:36 - 1/32 to the fourth fifth power.
94:43 - That gives me two times one to the fourth
power over 32 to the fourth power, which is
94:51 - two times one over 32/5 routed to the fourth
power. fifth root of 32 is two
94:59 - Raisa to the fourth power, I get 16. So this
is two times 1/16, which is 1/8, just as we
95:07 - wanted in the original equation up here. Similarly,
we can check that the P equals negative 1/32
95:16 - actually does satisfy the equation, I'll leave
that step to the viewer.
95:24 - So our two solutions are p equals one over
32, and P equals minus one over 32. I do want
95:30 - to point out an alternate approach to getting
rid of the fractional exponent, we could have
95:35 - gotten rid of it all in one fell swoop by
raising both sides of our equation to the
95:41 - five fourths power.
95:45 - five fourths is the reciprocal of four fifths.
So when I use my exponent rules, and say that
95:51 - when I raise the power to the power, I multiply
my exponents, that gives me p to the four
95:56 - fifths times five fourths is plus or minus
1/16 to the five fourths, in other words,
96:03 - P to the One Power, which is just P is plus
or minus 1/16, to the five fourths, so that's
96:10 - an alternate and possibly faster way to get
the solution. Once again, the plus or minus
96:16 - comes from the fact that when we take the
5/4 power, we're really taking an even root
96:22 - a fourth root, and so we need to consider
both positive and negative answers.
96:27 - This video is about solving radical equations,
that is equations like this one that have
96:33 - square root signs in them, or cube roots or
any other kind of radical.
96:39 - In this video, we solved radical equations
by first isolating the radical sign, or the
96:45 - fractional exponent,
96:48 - and then removing the radical sine or the
fractional exponent
96:54 - by either squaring both sides or taking the
reciprocal power of both sides.
97:01 - This video is about solving equations with
absolute values in them.
97:06 - Recall that the absolute value of a positive
number is just the number, but the absolute
97:12 - value of a negative number is its opposite.
In general, I think of the absolute value
97:17 - of a number as representing its distance from
zero on the number line,
97:23 - the number four,
97:25 - and the number of negative four are both at
distance for from zero, and so the absolute
97:32 - value of both of them is four.
97:35 - Similarly, if I write the equation, the absolute
value of x is three, that means that x has
97:44 - to be three units away from zero on the number
line.
97:50 - And so X would have to be either negative
three, or three. Let's start with the equation
97:56 - three times the absolute value of x plus two
equals four.
98:00 - I'd like to isolate the absolute value part
of the equation, I can do this by starting
98:08 - with my original equation,
98:14 - subtracting two from both sides
98:17 - and dividing both sides by three.
98:23 - Now I'll think in terms of distance on a number
line, the absolute value of x is two thirds
98:31 - means that x is two thirds away from zero.
So x could be here for here at negative two
98:40 - thirds or two thirds.
98:43 - And the answer to my equation is x is negative
two thirds, or two thirds,
98:50 - I can check my answers by plugging in
98:52 - three times the added value of negative two
thirds plus two, I need to check it that equals
99:00 - four. Well, the absolute value of negative
two thirds is just two thirds. So this is
99:04 - three times two thirds plus two, which works
out to four.
99:10 - Similarly, if I plug in positive two thirds,
it also works out to give me the correct answer.
99:20 - The second example is a little different,
because the opposite value sign is around
99:24 - a more complicated expression, not just around
the X.
99:29 - I would start by isolating the absolute value
part.
99:35 - But it's already isolated. So I'll just go
ahead and jump to thinking about distance
99:41 - on the number line. So on my number line,
the whole expression 3x plus two is supposed
99:49 - to be at a distance of four from zero.
99:53 - So that means that 3x plus two is here at
four or 3x plus two
99:59 - though is it negative four, all right, those
as equations
100:03 - 3x plus two equals four, or 3x plus two is
minus four. And then I can solve.
100:12 - So this becomes 3x equals two, or x equals
two thirds. And over here, I get 3x equals
100:20 - minus six, or x equals minus two. Finally,
I'll check my answers.
100:29 - I'll leave it to you to verify that they both
work.
100:32 - A common mistake on absolute value equations
is to get rid of the absolute value signs
100:38 - like we did here, and then just solve for
one answer, instead of solving for both answers.
100:44 - Another mistake sometimes people make is,
once they get the first answer, they just
100:48 - assume that the negative of that works also.
100:52 - But that doesn't always work. In the first
example, our two answers were both the negatives
100:57 - of each other. But in our second examples,
or two answers, were not just the opposites
101:02 - of each other one was two thirds and the other
was negative two.
101:06 - In this third example, let's again, isolate
the absolute value part of the equation.
101:12 - So starting with our original equation,
101:16 - we can subtract 16 from both sides,
101:22 - and divide both sides by five or equivalently,
multiply by 1/5.
101:31 - Now let's think about distance on the number
line,
101:35 - we have an absolute value needs to equal negative
three. So that means whatever is inside the
101:41 - absolute value sign needs to be at distance
negative three from zero, well, you can't
101:48 - be at distance negative three from zero. Another
way of thinking about this is you can't have
101:52 - the absolute value of something and end up
with a negative number if the value is always
101:57 - positive, or zero. So this equation doesn't
actually make sense, and there are no solutions
102:05 - to this equation.
102:07 - In this video, we solved absolute value equations.
In many cases, an absolute value equation
102:15 - will have two solutions. But in some cases,
it'll have no solutions. And occasionally,
102:20 - it'll have just one solution.
102:25 - This video is about interval notation, and
easy and well known way to record inequalities.
102:30 - Before dealing with interval notation, it
is important to know how to deal with inequalities.
102:39 - Our first example of an inequality is written
here, all numbers between one and three, not
102:45 - including one and three.
102:46 - First, we used to write down our variable
x, that it is important to locate the key
102:53 - values for this problem that is one and three.
Now here we see that x is between these two
103:01 - numbers, meaning we will have one inequality
statement on each side of the variable. Here
103:07 - it says not including one and three, which
means that we do not have an or equal to sign
103:12 - beneath each inequality. Here we will put
one the lowest key value, and here we will
103:18 - put three the highest key value. Next, we're
going to graph this inequality on a number
103:24 - line.
103:27 - Here we write our key values one, and three.
Because it is not including one, and three,
103:34 - we have an empty circle around each number.
Because it isn't the numbers between we have
103:40 - a line connecting them.
103:41 - The last step of this problem is writing this
inequality in interval notation.
103:50 - writing things in interval notation is kind
of like writing an ordered pair. Here we will
103:54 - put one and then here we will put three.
103:57 - Next we need to put brackets around these
numbers.
104:03 - For this problem, it is not including one
in three, which means we will use soft brackets.
104:09 - However, if it were including one and three,
we will use hard brackets.
104:15 - It is important to note for interval notation,
that the smallest value always goes on the
104:22 - left and the biggest value always goes on
the right.
104:29 - You also include a comma between your two
key values.
104:32 - Now let's work on problem B. Once again we
write our variable x. Again it is between
104:41 - negative four and two but this time it is
including a negative four into this requires
104:47 - us to have the or equal to assign below the
inequality. Then we put our lowest key value
104:53 - here and their highest here. The number line
graph for this problem is slightly different.
104:59 - We still
105:00 - have our key values negative four and two.
But instead of an open circle, like we have
105:07 - right here, we instead use a closed circle,
representing that it is including negative
105:15 - four and two, you complete this with a line
in between. Last we write this in interval
105:21 - notation. In the last problem, I said that
for numbers, including the outside values,
105:27 - we would use these hard brackets. Now we are
actually using this. So we have or hard bracket
105:35 - on each side because isn't including foreign
zoo, then we put our smallest value on the
105:40 - left, and our highest value on the right,
with the comma in between.
105:46 - You now know how to correctly write these
two types of intervals.
105:51 - Now we are going to practice transforming
these from inequality notation to interval
105:58 - notation, and vice versa. This is slightly
more difficult than our previous examples
106:05 - of having two soft brackets or two hard brackets,
we'll have two different types. Now on the
106:11 - left side will have a hard bracket because
it is including the three. However, on the
106:18 - right side, it is a soft bracket because it
is it it is not including the one that we
106:24 - put a comma in the middle, a lower key value
and our higher key value. For the next problem,
106:31 - we're taking an equation already written an
interval notation and putting it back into
106:37 - inequality notation.
106:38 - For the second problem, we can see are key
values as being five and negative infinity.
106:47 - Now, this sounds a little bit weird, but let's
just set up or an equality, we have our variable
106:54 - x, which is less than because of the soft
bracket five, and greater than without the
107:02 - or equal to because it has a soft bracket
there to infinity. But because x is always
107:09 - greater than negative infinity, we can take
out this part, leaving us with x is less than
107:16 - five.
107:17 - It is important to note that a soft bracket
always accompanies infinity. This is because
107:25 - infinity is not a real number, so we cannot
include it just go as far up to it as we can.
107:32 - The next problem is a little tricky, because
we don't see another key value over here.
107:38 - But let's just start off the equation as a
soft bracket on this side due to the absence
107:43 - of an order equal to sign. And negative 15
is the lower key value.
107:51 - On the other side, we put the highest possible
number infinity, and then close it off with
107:57 - a soft bracket. We can see the relation of
this to the previous problem. And how it goes
108:05 - into this problem when x is greater than a
key value instead of less than a key value.
108:12 - Once again, we have our sauce bracket for
infinity, which is always true.
108:19 - Part D brings up an important point about
which number goes on the left. For all of
108:26 - our other problems, we have had the inequalities
pointing left
108:30 - instead of rights. When seeing Part D, you
might think oh, four is on the left, so it
108:41 - would go here, and zero is on the right who
would go here. But that is not true.
108:47 - When writing inequalities, you must always
have the lower value on the left, which for
108:53 - this problem is zero. To fix this, we can
simply flip this inequality. So it reads like
109:01 - this, it is still identical just written in
an easier form to transform it into interval
109:06 - notation, then we can see that zero has a
soft bracket, because it is not including
109:13 - zero, but r comma four or other key value
and a hard backup because it is or equal to
109:19 - four.
109:21 - For interval notation, you must always have
the smaller number on the left side.
109:29 - This was our video on interval notation, an
alternative way to write inequalities.
109:36 - This video is about solving inequalities that
have absolute value signs in them.
109:41 - Let's look at the inequality absolute value
of x is less than five on the number line.
109:45 - Thinking of absolute value as distance. This
means that the distance between x and zero
109:52 - is less than five units. So x has to live
somewhere in between negative five and five
110:01 - We can express this as an inequality without
absolute value signs by saying negative five
110:06 - is less than x, which is less than five. Or
we can use interval notation, soft bracket
110:12 - negative five, five, soft bracket.
110:16 - Both of these formulations are equivalent
to the original one, but don't involve the
110:20 - absolute value signs.
110:23 - In the second example, we're looking for the
values of x for which the absolute value of
110:28 - x is greater than or equal to five.
110:32 - on the number line, this means that the distance
of x from the zero, it's got to be bigger
110:39 - than or equal to five units.
110:42 - A distance bigger than five units means that
x has to live somewhere over here, or somewhere
110:48 - over here, where it's farther than five units
away from zero. Course x could also have a
110:54 - distance equal to five units. So I'll fill
in that dot and shade in the other parts of
111:00 - the number line that satisfy my inequality.
111:04 - Now I can rewrite the inequality without the
absolute value symbols by saying that x is
111:10 - less than or equal to negative five, or x
is greater than or equal to five. I could
111:17 - also write this in interval notation,
111:20 - soft bracket, negative infinity, negative
five, hard bracket. And the second part is
111:26 - hard bracket five infinity soft bracket, I
combine these with a u for union. Because
111:33 - I'm trying to describe all these points on
the number line together with all these other
111:38 - points.
111:39 - Let's take this analysis a step further with
a slightly more complicated problem. Now I
111:44 - want the absolute value of three minus two
t to be less than four.
111:49 - And an absolute value less than four means
a distance less than four on the number line.
111:56 - But it's not the variable t that lives in
here at a distance of less than four from
112:00 - zero, it's the whole expression, three minus
two t.
112:04 - So three minus two t, live somewhere in here.
And I can rewrite this as an inequality without
112:13 - absolute value signs by saying negative four
is less than three minus two t is less than
112:21 - four. Now I have a compound inequality that
I can solve the usual way. First, I subtract
112:27 - three from all three sides to get negative
seven is less than negative two t is less
112:33 - than one. And now I'll divide all three sides
by negative two. Since negative two is a negative
112:40 - number, this reverses the directions of the
inequalities.
112:46 - Simplifying, I get seven halves is greater
than t is greater than negative one half.
112:52 - So my final answer on the number line looks
like all the stuff between negative a half
112:58 - and seven halves.
113:01 - But not including the endpoints, and an interval
notation, I can write this soft bracket negative
113:07 - a half, seven, half soft bracket,
113:09 - please pause the video and try the next problem
on your own.
113:14 - thinking in terms of distance, this inequality
says that the distance between the expression
113:19 - three minus two t and zero is always bigger
than four. Let me draw this on the number
113:25 - line.
113:27 - If three minus two t has a distance bigger
than four from zero, then it can't be in this
113:33 - region that's near zero, it has to be on the
outside in one of these two regions.
113:39 - That is three minus two t is either less than
negative four, or three minus two t is bigger
113:48 - than four. I solve these two inequalities
separately, the first one, subtracting three
113:54 - from both sides, I get negative two t is less
than negative seven divided by negative two,
114:01 - I get T is bigger than seven halves. And then
on the other side, I get negative two t is
114:08 - greater than one. So t is less than negative
one half, I had to flip inequalities in the
114:15 - last step due to dividing by a negative number.
So let's check this out on the number line
114:21 - again, the first piece says that t is greater
than seven halves. I'll draw that over here.
114:28 - And the second piece says that t is less than
negative one half. I'll draw that down here.
114:41 - Because these two statements are joined with
an or I'm looking for the t values that are
114:46 - in this one, or in this one. That is I want
both of these regions put together. So an
114:52 - interval notation, this reads negative infinity
to negative one half soft bracket union soft
115:00 - bracket
115:01 - Seven halves to infinity.
115:03 - This last example looks more complicated.
But if I simplify first and isolate the absolute
115:09 - value part, it looks pretty much like the
previous ones. So I'll start by subtracting
115:14 - seven from both sides. And then I'll divide
both sides by two. Now I'll draw my number
115:20 - line.
115:21 - And I'm looking for this expression for x
plus five, to always have distance greater
115:28 - than or equal to negative three from zero,
wait a second, distance greater than equal
115:33 - to negative three, well, distance is always
greater than or equal to negative three is
115:36 - always greater than equal to zero. So this,
in fact, is always true.
115:43 - And so the answer to my inequality is all
numbers between negative infinity and infinity.
115:50 - In other words, all real numbers.
115:55 - Once solving absolute value inequalities,
it's good to think about distance. And absolute
116:01 - value of something that's less than a number
means that whatever's inside the absolute
116:08 - value signs is close to zero.
116:12 - On the other hand, an absolute value is something
and being greater than a number means that
116:18 - whatever's inside the absolute value sign
is far away from zero, because its distance
116:25 - from zero is bigger than that certain number.
116:29 - drawing these pictures on the number line
is a helpful way to rewrite the absolute value
116:34 - and equality as an inequality that doesn't
contain an absolute value sign. In this case,
116:40 - it would be negative three is less than x
plus two is less than three. And in the other
116:47 - case, it would be either x plus two is less
than negative three, or x plus two is greater
116:53 - than three.
116:55 - This video is about solving linear inequalities.
Those are inequalities like this one that
117:01 - involve a variable here x, but don't involve
any x squared or other higher power terms.
117:09 - The good news is, we can solve linear inequalities,
just like we solve linear equations by distributing,
117:15 - adding and subtracting terms to both sides
and multiplying and dividing by numbers on
117:19 - both sides. The only thing that's different
is that if you multiply or divide by a negative
117:26 - number, then you need to reverse the direction
of the inequality. For example, if we had
117:32 - the inequality, negative x is less than negative
five, and we wanted to multiply both sides
117:39 - by negative one to get rid of the negative
signs, we'd have to also switch or reverse
117:45 - the inequality. With this caution in mind,
let's look at our first example.
117:50 - Since our variable x is trapped in parentheses,
I'll distribute the negative five to free
117:56 - it from the parentheses.
117:58 - That gives me negative 5x minus 10 plus three
is greater than eight.
118:04 - Negative 10 plus three is negative seven,
so I'll rewrite this as negative 5x minus
118:10 - seven is greater than eight. Now I'll add
seven to both sides to get negative 5x is
118:16 - greater than 15. Now I'd like to divide both
sides by negative five. Since negative five
118:23 - is a negative number that reverses the inequality.
So I get x is less than 15 divided by negative
118:31 - five. In other words, x is less than negative
three.
118:36 - If I wanted to graph this on a number line,
I just need to put down a negative three,
118:40 - an open circle around it, and shade in to
the left,
118:44 - I use an open circle, because x is strictly
less than negative three and can't equal negative
118:51 - three. If I wanted to write this in interval
notation, I've added a soft bracket negative
118:56 - infinity, negative three soft bracket. Again,
the soft bracket is because the negative three
119:01 - is not included. This next example is an example
of a compound inequality. It has two parts.
119:10 - Either this statement is true, or this statement
is true. I want to find the values of x that
119:15 - satisfy either one. I'll solve this by working
out each part separately, and then combining
119:21 - them at the end. For the inequality on the
left, I'll copy it over here. I'm going to
119:28 - add four to both sides.
119:32 - then subtract x from both sides
119:36 - and then divide both sides by two.
119:40 - I didn't have to reverse the inequality sign
because I divided by a positive number
119:45 - on the right side, I'll copy the equation
over, subtract one from both sides, and divide
119:51 - both sides by 696 is the same as three halves.
Now I'm looking for the x values that make
119:59 - this statement.
120:00 - row four, make this statement true. Let me
graph this on a number line.
120:07 - x is less than or equal to negative two, means
I put a filled in circle there and graph everything
120:14 - to the left. X is greater than three halves
means I put a empty circle here and shaded
120:22 - and everything to the right.
120:25 - My final answer includes both of these pieces,
which I'll reshade in green, because x is
120:33 - allowed to be an either one or the other.
Finally, I can write this in interval notation.
120:38 - The first piece on the number line can be
described as soft bracket negative infinity,
120:44 - negative two hard bracket. And the second
piece can be described as soft bracket three
120:50 - halves, infinity soft bracket to indicate
that x can be in either one of these pieces,
120:57 - I use the union side, which is a U.
121:01 - That means that my answer includes all x values
in here together with all x values in here.
121:09 - This next example is also a compound inequality.
This time I'm joined by an ad, the and means
121:15 - I'm looking for all y values that satisfy
both this and this at the same time. Again,
121:22 - I can solve each piece separately
121:25 - on the left, to isolate the Y, I need to multiply
by negative three halves on both sides. So
121:34 - that gives me Why is less than negative 12
times negative three halves, the greater than
121:40 - flip to a less than because I was multiplying
by negative three halves, which is a negative
121:46 - number.
121:47 - By clean up the right side, I get why is less
than 18.
121:54 - On the right side, I'll start by subtracting
two from both sides.
121:59 - And now I'll divide by negative four, again,
a negative number, so that flips the inequality.
122:07 - So that's why is less than three over negative
four. In other words, y is less than negative
122:13 - three fourths. Again, I'm looking for the
y values that make both of these statements
122:19 - true at the same time.
122:22 - Let me graph this on the number line,
122:25 - the Y is less than 18. I can graph that by
drawing the number 18.
122:34 - I don't want to include it. So I use an empty
circle and I shaded everything to the left
122:41 - the statement y is less than negative three
fourths, I need to draw a negative three fourths.
122:47 - And again, I don't include it, but I do include
everything on the left. Since I want the y
122:54 - values for which both of these statements
are true, I need the y values that are in
122:59 - both colored blue and colored red. And so
that would be this part right here. I'll just
123:05 - draw it above so you can see it easily. So
that would be all the numbers from negative
123:10 - three fourths and lower, not including negative
three, four, since those are the parts of
123:15 - the number line that have both red and blue
colors on them. In interval notation, my final
123:21 - answer will be soft bracket negative infinity
to negative three fourths soft bracket.
123:26 - As my final example, I have an inequality
that has two inequality signs in it negative
123:34 - three is less than or equal to 6x minus two
is less than 10. I can think of this as being
123:40 - a compound inequality with two parts, negative
3x is less than or equal to 6x minus two.
123:47 - And at the same time 6x minus two is less
than 10. I could solve this into pieces as
123:54 - before. But instead, it's a little more efficient
to just solve it all at once, by doing the
124:00 - same thing to all three sides. So as a first
step, I'll add two to all three sides. That
124:08 - gives me negative one is less than or equal
to 6x is less than 12. And now I'm going to
124:14 - divide all three sides by six to isolate the
x. So that gives me negative one, six is less
124:20 - than or equal to x is less than two.
124:24 - If we solved it, instead, in two pieces above,
we'd end up with the same thing because we
124:29 - get negative one six is less than or equal
to x from this piece, and we'd get x is less
124:35 - than two on this piece. And because of the
and statement, that's the same thing as saying
124:40 - negative one, six is less than or equal to
x, which is less than two.
124:45 - Either way we do it. Let's see if what it
looks like on the number line. So on the number
124:50 - line, we're looking for things that are between
two and negative one six, including the negative
124:58 - one, six
124:59 - But not including the to interval notation,
we can write this as hard bracket, negative
125:05 - 162 soft bracket.
125:08 - In this video, we solve linear inequalities,
including some compound inequalities, joined
125:13 - by the conjunctions and, and or,
125:18 - remember when we're working with and we're
looking for places on the number line where
125:22 - both statements are true.
125:24 - That is, we're looking for the overlap on
the number line.
125:30 - In this case, the points on the number line
that are colored both red and blue at the
125:35 - same time.
125:36 - When we're working with oral statements, we're
looking for places where either one or the
125:43 - other statement is true or both
125:46 - on the number line,
125:49 - this corresponds to points that are colored
either red or blue, or both. And in this picture,
125:54 - that will actually correspond to the entire
number line.
125:57 - In this video, we'll solve inequalities involving
polynomials like this one, and inequalities
126:04 - involving rational expressions like this one.
126:09 - Let's start with a simple example. Maybe a
deceptively simple example. If you see the
126:14 - inequality, x squared is less than four, you
might be very tempted to take the square root
126:19 - of both sides and get something like x is
less than two as your answer. But in fact,
126:26 - that doesn't work.
126:27 - To see why it's not correct, consider the
x value of negative 10.
126:35 - Negative 10 satisfies the inequality, x is
less than two since negative 10 is less than
126:43 - two. But it doesn't satisfy the inequality
x squared is less than four, since negative
126:51 - 10 squared is 100, which is not less than
four. So these two inequalities are not the
126:58 - same. And it doesn't work to solve a quadratic
inequality just to take the square root of
127:04 - both sides, you might be thinking part of
why this reasoning is wrong, as we've ignored
127:09 - the negative two option, right? If we had
the equation, x squared equals four, then
127:15 - x equals two would just be one option, x equals
negative two would be another solution. So
127:21 - somehow, our solution to this inequality should
take this into account. In fact, a good way
127:27 - to solve an inequality involving x squares
or higher power terms, is to solve the associated
127:33 - equation first. But before we even do that,
I like to pull everything over to one side,
127:40 - so that my inequality has zero on the other
side.
127:44 - So for our equation, I'll subtract four from
both sides to get x squared minus four is
127:49 - less than zero.
127:50 - Now, I'm going to actually solve the associated
equation, x squared minus four is equal to
127:58 - zero, I can do this by factoring to x minus
two times x plus two is equal to zero. And
128:06 - I'll set my factors equal to zero, and I get
x equals two and x equals minus two.
128:12 - Now, I'm going to plot the solutions to my
equation on the number line. So I write down
128:17 - negative two and two, those are the places
where my expression x squared minus four is
128:23 - equal to zero.
128:26 - Since I want to find where x squared minus
four is less than zero, I want to know where
128:30 - this expression x squared minus four is positive
or negative, a good way to find that out is
128:36 - to plug in test values. So first, a plug in
a test value in this area of the number line,
128:43 - something less than negative to say x equals
negative three.
128:47 - If I plug in negative three into x squared
minus four, I get negative three squared minus
128:53 - four, which is nine minus four, which is five,
that's a positive number. So at negative three,
129:02 - the expression x squared minus four is positive.
And in fact, everywhere on this region of
129:08 - the number line, my expression is going to
be positive, because it can jump from positive
129:12 - to negative without going through a place
where it's zero, I can figure out whether
129:17 - x squared minus four is positive or negative
on this region, and on this region of the
129:21 - number line by plugging in test value similar
way,
129:25 - evaluate the plug in between negative two
and two, a nice value is x equals 00 squared
129:31 - minus four, that's negative four and negative
number. So I know that my expression x squared
129:36 - minus four is negative on this whole interval.
Finally, I can plug in something like x equals
129:43 - 10, something bigger than two, and I get 10
squared minus four. Without even computing
129:49 - that I can tell that that's going to be a
positive number. And that's all that's important.
129:53 - Again, since I want x squared minus four to
be less than zero, I'm looking for the places
129:57 - on this number line where I'm getting
129:59 - negatives. So I will share that in on my number
line. It's in here, not including the endpoints.
130:06 - Because the endpoints are where my expression
x squared minus four is equal to zero, and
130:10 - I want it strictly less than zero,
130:12 - I can write my answer as an inequality, negative
two is less than x is less than two, or an
130:19 - interval notation as soft bracket negative
two to soft bracket.
130:25 - Our next example, we can solve similarly,
first, we'll move everything to one side,
130:32 - so that our inequality is x cubed minus 5x
squared minus 6x is greater than or equal
130:39 - to zero. Next, we'll solve the associated
equation by factoring. So first, I'll write
130:47 - down the equation. Now I'll factor out an
x. And now I'll factor the quadratic. So the
130:55 - solutions to my equation are x equals 0x equals
six and x equals negative one,
131:01 - I'll write the solutions to the equation on
the number line.
131:05 - So that's negative one, zero, and six. That's
where my expression x times x minus six times
131:17 - x plus one is equal to zero.
131:21 - But I want to find where it's greater than
or equal to zero. So again, I can use test
131:28 - values, I can plug in, for example, x equals
negative two, either to this version of expression,
131:35 - or to this factored version. Since I only
care whether my answer is positive or negative,
131:40 - it's sometimes easier to use the factored
version. For example, when x is negative two,
131:45 - this factor is negative.
131:48 - But this factor, x minus six is also negative
when I plug in negative two for x.
131:55 - Finally, x plus one, when I plug in negative
two for x, that's negative one, that's also
132:03 - negative. And a negative times a negative
times a negative gives me a negative number.
132:08 - If I plug in something, between negative one
and zero, say x equals negative one half,
132:16 - then I'm going to get a negative for this
factor, a negative for this factor, but a
132:21 - positive for this third factor.
132:25 - Negative times negative times positive gives
me a positive
132:28 - for a test value between zero and six, let's
try x equals one.
132:34 - Now I'll get a positive for this factor a
negative for this factor, and a positive for
132:41 - this factor.
132:43 - positive times a negative times a positive
gives me a negative. Finally, for a test value
132:50 - bigger than six, we could use say x equals
100. That's going to give me positive, positive
132:56 - positive.
132:59 - So my product will be positive.
133:03 - Since I want values where my expression is
greater than or equal to zero, I want the
133:08 - places where it equals zero.
133:12 - And the places where it's positive.
133:16 - So my final answer will be close bracket negative
one to zero, close bracket union, close bracket
133:24 - six to infinity.
133:25 - As our final example, let's consider the rational
inequality, x squared plus 6x plus nine divided
133:34 - by x minus one is less than or equal to zero.
133:38 - Although it might be tempting to clear the
denominator and multiply both sides by x minus
133:43 - one, it's dangerous to do that, because x
minus one could be a positive number. But
133:49 - it could also be a negative number. And when
you multiply both sides by a negative number,
133:53 - you have to reverse the inequality. Although
it's possible to solve the inequality this
133:59 - way, by thinking of cases where x minus one
is less than zero or bigger than zero, I think
134:04 - it's much easier just to solve the same way
as we did before. So we'll start by rewriting
134:10 - so that we move all terms to the left and
have zero on the right. Well, that's already
134:15 - true. So the next step would be to solve the
associated equation.
134:20 - That is x squared plus 6x plus nine over x
minus one is equal to zero.
134:29 - That would be where the numerator is 0x squared
plus 6x plus nine is equal to zero. So we're
134:35 - x plus three squared is zero, or x equals
negative three. There's one extra step we
134:42 - have to do for rational expressions. And that's
we need to find where the expression does
134:48 - not exist. That is, let's find where the denominator
is zero. And that said, x equals one.
134:55 - I'll put all those numbers on the number line.
The places where am I
134:59 - rational expression is equal to zero, and
the place where my rational expression doesn't
135:04 - exist, then I can start in with test values.
For example, x equals minus four, zero and
135:13 - to work. If I plug those values into this
expression here, I get a negative answer a
135:20 - negative answer and a positive answer. The
reason I need to conclude the values on my
135:26 - number line where my denominators zero is
because I can my expression can switch from
135:32 - negative to positive by passing through a
place where my rational expression doesn't
135:36 - exist, as well as passing by passing flew
through a place where my rational expression
135:41 - is equal to zero.
135:43 - Now I'm looking for where my original expression
was less than or equal to zero. So that means
135:49 - I want the places on the number line where
my expression is equal to zero, and also the
135:56 - places where it's negative.
135:59 - So my final answer is x is less than one,
or an interval notation, negative infinity
136:06 - to one.
136:08 - In this video, we solved polynomial and rational
inequalities by making a number line and you
136:14 - think test values to make a sine chart.
136:19 - The distance formula can be used to find the
distance between two points, if we know their
136:26 - coordinates,
136:27 - if this first point has coordinates, x one,
y one, and the second point has coordinates
136:34 - x two, y two, then the distance between them
is given by the formula, the square root of
136:42 - x two minus x one squared plus y two minus
y one squared.
136:49 - This formula actually comes from the Pythagorean
Theorem, let me draw a right triangle with
136:55 - these two points as two of its vertices,
137:01 - then the length of this side is the difference
between the 2x coordinates. Similarly, the
137:09 - length of this vertical side is the difference
between the two y coordinates.
137:14 - Now that Pythagoras theorem says that for
any right triangle, with sides labeled A and
137:20 - B, and hypotony is labeled C, we have that
a squared plus b squared equals c squared.
137:27 - Well, if we apply that to this triangle here,
137:31 - this hypotony News is the distance between
the two points that we're looking for.
137:38 - So but Tyrion theorem says, the square of
this side length, that is x two minus x one
137:45 - squared, plus the square of this side length,
which is y two minus y one squared has to
137:55 - equal the square of the hypothesis, that is
d squared.
138:01 - taking the square root of both sides of this
equation, we get the square root of x two
138:07 - minus x one squared plus y two minus y one
squared is equal to d,
138:13 - we don't have to worry about using plus or
minus signs when we take the square root because
138:18 - distance is always positive.
138:21 - So we've derived our distance formula. Now
let's use it as an example.
138:26 - Let's find the distance between the two points,
negative one five, for negative one, five,
138:34 - maybe over here, and for two,
138:39 - this notation just means that P is the point
with coordinates negative one five, and q
138:48 - is the point with coordinates for two.
138:52 - We have the distance formula,
138:54 - let's think of P being the point with coordinates
x one y one, and Q being the point with coordinates
139:02 - x two y two.
139:04 - But as we'll see, it really doesn't matter
which one is which, plugging into our formula,
139:10 - we get d is the square root of n x two minus
x one. So that's four minus negative one squared,
139:23 - and then we add
139:26 - y two minus y one, so that's two minus five
squared.
139:37 - Working out the arithmetic a little bit for
minus negative one, that's four plus one or
139:41 - five squared, plus negative three squared.
So that's the square root of 25 plus nine
139:49 - are the square root of 34. Let's see what
would have happened if we'd call this first
139:55 - point, x two y two instead, and a second.
140:00 - Why'd x one y one, then we would have gotten
the same distance formula, but we would have
140:06 - taken negative one minus four
140:12 - and added the difference of y's squared. So
that's why two five minus two squared.
140:22 - That gives us the square root of negative
five squared plus three squared, which works
140:27 - out to the same thing.
140:31 - In this video, we use the distance formula
to find the distance between two points. When
140:36 - writing down the distance formula, sometimes
students forget whether this is a plus or
140:40 - a minus and whether these are pluses or minuses.
One way to remember is to think that the distance
140:45 - formula comes from the Pythagorean Theorem.
That's why there's a plus in here.
140:51 - And then a minus in here, because we're finding
the difference between the coordinates to
140:56 - find the lengths of the sides.
140:59 - The midpoint formula helps us find the coordinates
of the midpoint of a line segment, as long
141:05 - as we know the coordinates of the endpoints.
141:09 - So let's call the coordinates of this endpoint
x one, y one, and the coordinates of this
141:15 - other endpoint x two, y two,
141:17 - the x coordinate of the midpoint is going
to be exactly halfway in between the x coordinates
141:25 - of the endpoints. To get a number halfway
in between two other numbers, we just take
141:31 - the average.
141:34 - Similarly, the y coordinate of this midpoint
is going to be exactly halfway in between
141:42 - the y coordinates of the endpoints. So the
y coordinate of the midpoint is going to be
141:47 - the average of those y coordinates.
141:53 - So we see that the coordinates of the midpoint
are x one plus x two over two, y one plus
142:00 - y two over two.
142:04 - Let's use this midpoint formula in an example,
142:07 - we want to find the midpoint of the segment
between the points, negative one, five,
142:17 - and four
142:20 - to
142:24 - me draw the line segment between them. So
visually, the midpoint is going to be somewhere
142:29 - around here. But to find its exact coordinates,
we're going to use x one plus x two over two,
142:36 - and y one plus y two over two, where this
first point is coordinates, x one, y one,
142:44 - and the second point has coordinates x two
y two, it doesn't actually matter which point
142:49 - you decide is x one y one, which one is x
two, y two, the formula will still give you
142:54 - the same answer for the midpoint.
142:56 - So let's see, I take my average of my x coordinates.
So that's negative one, plus four over two,
143:06 - and the average of my Y coordinates, so that's
five plus two over two, and I get three halves,
143:15 - seven halves, as the coordinates of my midpoint.
143:19 - In this video, we use the midpoint formula
to find the midpoint of a line segment, just
143:25 - by taking the average of the x coordinates
and the average of the y coordinates. This
143:30 - video is about graphs and equations of circles.
Suppose we want to find the equation of a
143:36 - circle of radius five, centered at the point
three, two
143:42 - will look something like this.
143:47 - For any point, x, y on the circle, we know
that
143:53 - the distance of that point xy from the center
is equal to the radius that is five from the
144:00 - distance formula, that distance of five is
equal to the square root of the difference
144:07 - of the x coordinates. That's x minus three
144:11 - squared plus the difference of the y coordinates,
that's y minus two squared.
144:20 - And if I square both sides of that equation,
I get five squared is this square root squared.
144:31 - In other words, 25 is equal to x minus three
squared plus y minus two squared. Since the
144:40 - square root and the squared undo each other.
144:43 - A lot of times people will write the X minus
three squared plus y minus two squared on
144:49 - the left side of the equation and the 25 on
the right side of the equation. This is the
144:53 - standard form for the equation of the circle.
144:58 - The same reasoning can be generalized
144:59 - Find the general equation for a circle with
radius R centered at a point HK.
145:07 - For any point with coordinates, x, y on the
circle, the distance between the point with
145:14 - coordinates x, y and the point with coordinates
HK is equal to the radius r. So we have that
145:22 - the distance is equal to r, but by the distance
formula, that's the square root of the difference
145:28 - between the x coordinates x minus h squared
plus the difference in the y coordinates y
145:36 - minus k squared. squaring both sides as before,
we get r squared is the square root squared,
145:48 - canceling the square root and the squared,
and rearranging the equation, that gives us
145:53 - x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals
r squared. That's the general formula for
146:01 - a circle with radius r, and center HK.
146:06 - Notice that the coordinates h and k are subtracted
here, the two squares are added because they
146:13 - are in the distance formula, and the radius
is squared on the other side, if you remember
146:18 - this general formula, that makes it easy to
write down the equation for a circle, for
146:23 - example, if we want the equation for a circle,
146:29 - of radius six, and center at zero, negative
three,
146:35 - then we have our equal six, and h k is our
zero negative three. So plugging into the
146:45 - formula,
146:47 - we get x minus zero squared, plus y minus
negative three squared equals six squared,
146:57 - or simplified this is x squared plus y plus
three squared equals 36.
147:04 - Suppose we're given an equation like this
one, and we want to decide if it's the equation
147:09 - of a circle, and if so what's the center was
the radius.
147:13 - Well, this equation matches the form for a
circle, x minus h squared plus y minus k squared
147:21 - equals r squared. If we let h, b five, Why
be negative sex since that way, subtracting
147:30 - a negative six is like adding a six,
147:34 - five must be our r squared. So that means
that R is the square root of five. So this
147:41 - is our radius. And our center is the point
five, negative six. And this is indeed the
147:49 - equation for a circle,
147:52 - which we could then graph by putting down
the center and estimating the radius, which
147:57 - is a little bit more than two.
148:03 - This equation might not look like the equation
of a circle, but it actually can be transformed.
148:08 - To look like the equation of a circle, we're
trying to make it look like something of the
148:13 - form x minus h squared plus y minus k squared
equals r squared.
148:19 - First, I'd like to get rid of the coefficients
in front of the x squared and the y squared,
148:24 - so I'm going to divide everything by nine.
This gives me x squared plus y squared plus
148:30 - 8x minus two y plus four equals zero. Next,
I'm going to group the x terms together the
148:38 - x squared and the 8x. So write x squared plus
8x. I'll group the y terms together the Y
148:45 - squared minus two y.
148:49 - And I'll subtract the four over to the other
side.
148:54 - This still doesn't look much like the equation
of a circle. But as the next step, I'm going
148:59 - to do something called completing the square,
I'm going to take this coefficient of x eight
149:05 - divided by two and then square it. In other
words, eight over two squared, that's four
149:12 - squared, which is 16. I'm going to add 16
to both sides of my equation.
149:18 - So the 16 here,
149:22 - and on the other side,
149:24 - now I'm going to do the same thing to the
coefficient of y, negative two divided by
149:31 - two is negative one, square that and I get
one. So now I'm going to add a one to both
149:38 - sides, but I'll put it near the y terms. So
add a one there. And then to keep things balanced,
149:44 - I have to add it to the other side. On the
right side, I have the number 13. On the left
149:50 - side, I can wrap up this expression x squared
plus 8x plus 16 into x plus four squared.
149:59 - To convince you, that's correct. If we multiply
out x plus four times x plus four, we get
150:07 - x squared plus 4x plus 4x plus 16, or x squared
plus 8x plus 16, the same thing we have right
150:16 - here. Similarly, we can wrap up y squared
minus two y plus one as
150:25 - y minus one squared. Again, I'll work out
the distribution down here, that's y squared
150:32 - minus y minus y plus one, or y squared minus
two y plus one, just like we have up here.
150:40 - If you're wondering how I knew to use four
and minus one, the four came from taking half
150:46 - of eight, and the minus one came from taking
half the negative two. Now we have an equation
150:53 - for a circle and standard form. And we can
read off the center, which is negative four,
151:01 - negative one, and the radius, which is the
square root of 13.
151:10 - It might seem like magic that this trick of
taking half of this coefficient and squaring
151:14 - it and adding it to both sides lets us wrap
up this expression into this expression a
151:20 - perfect square. But to see why that works,
let's take a look at what happens if we expand
151:26 - out x minus h squared, the thing that we're
trying to get to. So if we expand that out,
151:33 - x minus h squared, which is x minus h times
x minus h is, which multiplies out to x squared
151:43 - minus HX minus h x plus h squared, or x squared
minus two h x plus h squared. Now if we start
151:53 - out with this part, with some x squared term
and some coefficient of x, we're trying to
152:01 - decide what to add on in order to wrap it
up into x minus h squared. The thing to add
152:06 - on is h squared here, which comes from half
of this coefficient squared, right, because
152:13 - half of negative two H is a negative H, square
that you get the H squared. And then when
152:18 - we do wrap it up, it's half of this coefficient
of x, that appears right here.
152:26 - This trick of completing the square is really
handy for turning an equation for a circle
152:30 - in disguise, into the standard equation for
the circle. In this video, we found the standard
152:37 - equation for a circle x minus h squared plus
y minus k squared equals r squared, where
152:44 - r is the radius, and h k is the center.
152:52 - We also showed a method of completing the
square.
152:56 - When you have an equation for a circle in
disguise, completing the square will help
153:01 - you rewrite it into the standard form.
153:06 - This video is about graphs and equations of
lines.
153:10 - Here we're given the graph of a line, we want
to find the equation, one standard format
153:16 - for the equation of a line is y equals mx
plus b. here am represents the slope, and
153:25 - B represents the y intercept, the y value
where the line crosses the y axis, the slope
153:34 - is equal to the rise over the run. Or sometimes
this is written as the change in y values
153:41 - over the change in x values. Or in other words,
y two minus y one over x two minus x one,
153:49 - where x one y one and x two y two are points
on the line.
153:56 - While we could use any two points on the line,
to find the slope, it's convenient to use
154:01 - points where the x and y coordinates are integers,
that is points where the line passes through
154:08 - grid points. So here would be one convenient
point to use. And here's another convenient
154:13 - point to use.
154:15 - The coordinates of the first point are one,
two, and the next point, this is let's say,
154:22 - five, negative one. Now I can find the slope
by looking at the rise over the run. So as
154:29 - I go through a run of this distance, I go
through a rise of that distance especially
154:35 - gonna be a negative rise or a fall because
my line is pointing down. So let's see counting
154:41 - off squares. This is a run of 1234 squares
and a rise of 123. So negative three, so my
154:48 - slope is going to be
154:52 - negative three over four.
154:56 - I got that answer by counting squares, but
I could have also gotten it by
155:00 - Looking at the difference in my y values over
the difference in my x values, that is, I
155:05 - could have done
155:08 - negative one minus two, that's from my difference
in Y values, and divide that by my difference
155:15 - in x values,
155:18 - which is five minus one, that gives me negative
three over four, as before.
155:26 - So my M is negative three fourths.
155:30 - Now I need to figure out the value of b, my
y intercept, well, I could just read it off
155:36 - the graph, it looks like approximately 2.75.
But if I want to be more accurate, I can again
155:41 - use a point that has integer coordinates that
I know it's exact coordinates. So either this
155:47 - point or that point, let's try this point.
And I can start off with my equation y equals
155:53 - mx plus b, that is y equals negative three
fourths x plus b. And I can plug in the point
156:02 - one, two, for my x and y. So that gives me
two equals negative three fourths times one
156:12 - plus b, solving for B. Let's see that's two
equals negative three fourths plus b. So add
156:20 - three fourths to both sides, that's two plus
three fourths equals b. So b is eight fourths
156:28 - plus three fourths, which is 11. Four switches
actually, just what I eyeballed it today.
156:33 - So now I can write out my final equation for
my line y equals negative three fourths x
156:40 - plus 11 fourths by plugging in for m and b.
Next, let's find the equation for this horizontal
156:48 - line.
156:49 - a horizontal line has slope zero. So if we
think of it as y equals mx plus b, m is going
156:57 - to be zero. In other words, it's just y equals
b, y is some constant. So if we can figure
157:03 - out what that that constant y value is, it
looks like it's
157:08 - two, let's see this three, three and a half,
we can just write down the equation directly,
157:14 - y equals 3.5.
157:18 - For a vertical line, like this one, it doesn't
really have a slope. I mean, if you tried
157:24 - to do the rise over the run,
157:26 - there's no run. So you'd I guess you'd be
dividing by zero and get an infinite slope.
157:32 - But But instead, we just think of it as an
equation of the form x equals something. And
157:39 - in this case, x equals negative two, notice
that all of the points on our line have the
157:45 - same x coordinate of negative two and the
y coordinate can be anything.
157:50 - So this is how we write the equation for a
vertical line.
157:54 - In this example, we're not shown a graph of
the line, we're just get told that it goes
157:59 - through two points. But knowing that I go
through two points is enough to find the equation
158:04 - for the line. First, we can find the slope
by taking the difference in Y values over
158:12 - the difference in x values. So that's negative
three minus two over four minus one, which
158:20 - is negative five thirds.
158:24 - So we can use the
158:26 - standard equation for the line, this is called
the slope intercept form.
158:34 - And we can plug in negative five thirds. And
we can use one point, either one will do will
158:42 - still get the same final answer. So let's
use one two and plug that in to get two equals
158:48 - negative five thirds times one plus b. And
so B is two plus five thirds, which is six
158:57 - thirds plus five thirds, which is 11 thirds.
So our equation is y equals negative five
159:03 - thirds x plus 11 thirds.
159:07 - This is method one.
159:11 - method two uses a slightly different form
of the equation, it's called the point slope
159:17 - form and it goes y minus y naught is equal
to m times x minus x naught, where x naught
159:25 - y naught is a point on the line and again
is the slope. So we calculate the slope the
159:33 - same way by taking a difference in Y values
over a difference in x values. But then, we
159:40 - can simply plug in any point.
159:43 - For example, the point one two will work we
can plug one in for x naught and two in for
159:53 - Y not in this point slope form. That gives
us y
159:59 - minus
160:00 - Two is equal to minus five thirds x minus
one.
160:06 - Notice that these two equations, while they
may look different, are actually equivalent,
160:11 - because if I distribute the negative five
thirds, and then add the two to both sides,
160:25 - I get the same equation as above.
160:28 - So we've seen two ways of finding the equation
for the line using the slope intercept form.
160:37 - And using the point slope form.
160:40 - In this video, we saw that you can find the
equation for a line, if you know the slope.
160:48 - And you know one point,
160:52 - you can also find the equation for the line
if you know two points, because you can use
160:57 - the two points to get the slope and then plug
in one of those points. To figure out the
161:03 - rest of the equation.
161:06 - We saw two standard forms for the equation
of a line
161:08 - the slope intercept form y equals mx plus
b, where m is the slope, and B is the y intercept.
161:19 - And the point slope form y minus y naught
equals m times x minus x naught, where m again
161:27 - is the slope and x naught y naught is a point
on the line.
161:35 - This video is about finding parallel and perpendicular
lines. Suppose we have a line of slope three
161:43 - fourths, in other words, the rise
161:47 - over the run
161:50 - is three over four,
161:52 - than any other line that's parallel to this
line will have the same slope, the same fries
162:01 - over run.
162:03 - So that's our first fact to keep in mind,
parallel lines have the same slopes. Suppose
162:09 - on the other hand, we want to find a line
perpendicular to our original line with its
162:15 - original slope of three fourths.
162:18 - A perpendicular line, in other words, align
at a 90 degree angle to our original line
162:25 - will have a slope, that's the negative reciprocal
of the opposite reciprocal of our original
162:32 - slope. So we take the reciprocal of three
for us, that's four thirds, and we make it
162:37 - its opposite by changing it from positive
to negative.
162:41 - So I'll write this as a principle that perpendicular
lines have opposite reciprocal slopes, to
162:49 - get the hang of what it means to be an opposite
reciprocal, let's look at a few examples.
162:54 - So here's the original slope, and this will
be the opposite reciprocal, which would represent
163:01 - the slope of our perpendicular line. So for
example, if one was to the opposite reciprocal,
163:07 - reciprocal of two is one half opposite means
I change the sign, if the first slope turned
163:14 - out to be, say, negative 1/3, the reciprocal
of 1/3 is three over one or just three. And
163:23 - the opposite means I change it from a negative
to a positive, so my perpendicular slope would
163:29 - be would be three.
163:32 - One more example, if I started off with a
slope of, say, seven halves, then the reciprocal
163:38 - of that would be two sevenths. And I change
it to an opposite reciprocal, by changing
163:43 - the positive to a negative.
163:47 - Let's use these two principles in some examples.
163:52 - In our first example, we need to find the
equation of a line that's parallel to this
163:56 - slump, and go through the point negative three
two. Well, in order to get started, I need
164:02 - to figure out the slope of this line. So let
me put this line into a more standard form
164:07 - the the slope intercept form. So I'll start
with three y minus 4x plus six equals zero,
164:14 - I'm going to solve for y to put it in this
this more standard form. So I'll say three
164:19 - y equals 4x minus six and then divide by three
to get y equals four thirds x minus six thirds
164:29 - is divided all my turns by three, I can simplify
that a little bit y equals four thirds x minus
164:34 - two. Now I can read off the slope of my original
line, and one is four thirds. That means my
164:43 - slope of my new line, my parallel line will
also be four thirds. So my new line will have
164:51 - the equation y equals four thirds ax plus
b for some B, of course, B will probably not
164:58 - be negative two like it was for the
165:00 - first line, it'll be something else determined
by the fact that it goes through this point
165:04 - negative three to, to figure out what b is,
I plug in the point negative three to four,
165:10 - negative three for x, and two for y. So that
gives me two equals four thirds times negative
165:16 - three plus b, and I'll solve for b. So let's
see. First, let me just simplify. So two equals,
165:25 - this is negative 12 thirds plus b, or in other
words, two is negative four plus b. So that
165:32 - means that B is going to be six, and by my
parallel line will have the equation y equals
165:38 - four thirds x plus six.
165:42 - Next, let's find the equation of a line that's
perpendicular to a given line through and
165:49 - go through a given point. Again, in order
to get started, I need to find what the slope
165:54 - of this given line is. So I'll rewrite it,
well, first, I'll just copy it over 6x plus
165:59 - three, y equals four. And then I can put it
in the standard slope intercept form by solving
166:06 - for y. So three, y is negative 6x plus four,
divide everything by three, I get y equals
166:14 - negative six thirds x plus four thirds. So
y is negative 2x, plus four thirds. So my
166:22 - original slope of my original line is negative
two, which means my perpendicular slope is
166:28 - the opposite reciprocal, so I take the reciprocal
of of negative two, that's negative one half
166:34 - and I change the sign so that gives me one
half as the slope of my perpendicular line.
166:39 - Now, my new line, I know is going to be y
equals one half x plus b for some B, and I
166:47 - can plug in my point on my new line, so one
for y and four for x, and solve for b, so
166:57 - I get one equals two plus b, So b is negative
one. And so my new line has equation one half
167:04 - x minus one.
167:07 - These next two examples are a little bit different,
because now we're looking at a line parallel
167:14 - to a completely horizontal line, let me draw
this line y equals three, so the y coordinate
167:23 - is always three, which means that my line
will be a horizontal line through that height
167:29 - at height y equals three, if I want something
parallel to this line, it will also be a horizontal
167:36 - line. Since it goes through the point negative
two, one, C, negative two, one has to go through
167:42 - that point there,
167:45 - it's gonna have always have a y coordinate
of one the same as the y coordinate of the
167:51 - point it goes through, so my answer will just
be y equals one.
167:55 - In the next example, we want a line that's
perpendicular to the line y equals four another
168:06 - horizontal line y equals four, but perpendicular
means I'm going to need a vertical line. So
168:12 - I need a vertical line that goes through the
point three, four.
168:16 - Okay, and so I'm going to draw a vertical
line there. Now vertical lines have the form
168:27 - x equals something for the equation. And to
find what x equals, I just need to look at
168:32 - the x coordinate of the point I'm going through
this point three four, so that x coordinate
168:38 - is three and all the points on this, this
perpendicular and vertical line have X coordinate
168:45 - three so my answer is x equals three.
168:53 - In this video will use the fact that parallel
lines have the same slope and perpendicular
168:58 - lines have opposite reciprocal slopes, to
find the equations of parallel and perpendicular
169:03 - lines.
169:05 - This video introduces functions and their
domains and ranges.
169:09 - A function is a correspondence between input
numbers usually the x values and output numbers,
169:17 - usually the y values, that sends each input
number to exactly one output number. Sometimes
169:25 - a function is thought of as a rule or machine
169:28 - in which you can feed in x values as input
and get out y values as output. So, non mathematical
169:38 - example of a function might be the biological
mother function, which takes as input any
169:44 - person and it gives us output their biological
mother.
169:49 - This function satisfies the condition that
each input number object person in this case,
169:57 - get sent to exactly one output per
170:01 - Because if you take any person, they just
have one biological mother. So that rule does
170:07 - give you a function. But if I change things
around and just use the the mother function,
170:14 - which sends to each person, their mother,
that's no longer going to be a function because
170:19 - there are some people who have more than one
mother, right, they could have a biological
170:23 - mother and adopted mother, or a mother and
a stepmother, or any number of situations.
170:28 - So since there's, there's at least some people
who you would put it as input, and then you'd
170:33 - get like more than one possible output that
violates this, this rule of functions, that
170:39 - would not be a function. Now, most of the
time, we'll work with functions that are described
170:43 - with equations, not in terms of mothers. So
for example, we can have the function y equals
170:48 - x squared plus one.
170:51 - This can also be written as f of x equals
x squared plus one. Here, f of x is function
170:57 - notation that stands for the output value
of y.
171:02 - Notice that this notation is not representing
multiplication, we're not multiplying f by
171:07 - x, instead, we're going to be putting in a
value for x as input and getting out a value
171:14 - of f of x or y. For example, if we want to
evaluate f of two, we're plugging in two as
171:21 - input for x either in this equation, or in
that equation. Since F of two means two squared
171:30 - plus one, f of two is going to equal five.
Similarly, f of five means I plug in five
171:38 - for x, so that's gonna be five squared plus
one, or 26. Sometimes it's useful to evaluate
171:46 - a function on a more complicated expression
involving other variables. In this case, remember,
171:52 - the functions value on any expression, it's
just what you what you get when you plug in
171:57 - that whole expression for x.
172:00 - So f of a plus three is going to be the quantity
a plus three squared plus one,
172:09 - we could rewrite that as a squared plus six
a plus nine plus one, or a squared plus six
172:17 - a plus 10.
172:19 - When evaluating a function on a complex expression,
it's important to keep the parentheses when
172:25 - you plug in for x. That way, you evaluate
the function on the whole expression. For
172:32 - example, it would be wrong
172:35 - to write f of a plus three equals a plus three
squared plus one without the parentheses,
172:42 - because that would imply that we were just
squaring the three and not the whole expression,
172:47 - a plus three.
172:52 - Sometimes a function is described with a graph
instead of an equation. In this example, this
172:58 - graph is supposed to represent the function
g of x. Not all graphs actually represent
173:04 - functions. For example, the graph of a circle
doesn't represent a function. That's because
173:11 - the graph of a circle violates the vertical
line test, you can draw a vertical line and
173:15 - intersect the graph in more than one point.
173:18 - But our graph, it left satisfies the vertical
line test, any vertical line intersects the
173:24 - graph, and at most one point, that means is
a function, because every x value will have
173:29 - at most one y value that corresponds to it.
Let's evaluate g have to note that two is
173:37 - an x value. And we'll use the graph to find
the corresponding y value. So I look for two
173:44 - on the x axis, and find the point on the graph
that has that x value that's right here. Now
173:51 - I can look at the y value of that point looks
like three, and therefore gf two is equal
173:58 - to three. If I try to do the same thing to
evaluate g of five, I run into trouble. Five
174:05 - is an x value, I look for it on the x axis,
but there's no point on the graph that has
174:11 - that x value.
174:13 - Therefore, g of five is undefined, or we can
say it does not exist. The question of what
174:21 - x values and y values make sense for a function
leads us to a discussion of domain and range.
174:27 - The domain of a function is all possible x
values that makes sense for that function.
174:32 - The range is the y values that make sense
for the function.
174:36 - In this example, we saw that the x value of
five didn't have a corresponding y value for
174:42 - this function. So the x value of five is not
in the domain of our function J. To find the
174:49 - x values in the domain, we have to look at
the x values that correspond to points on
174:54 - the graph. One way to do that is to take the
shadow or projection of the graph
175:00 - onto the x axis and see what x values are
hit. It looks like we're hitting all x values
175:07 - starting at negative eight, and continuing
up to four. So our domain
175:15 - is the x's between negative eight, and four,
including those endpoints. Or we can write
175:21 - this in interval notation as negative eight
comma four with square brackets.
175:27 - To find the range of the function, we look
for the y values corresponding to points on
175:31 - this graph, we can do that.
175:35 - By taking the shadow or projection of the
graph onto the y axis,
175:42 - we seem to be hitting our Y values from negative
five, up through three.
175:51 - So our range is wise between negative five
and three are an interval notation negative
175:59 - five, three with square brackets. If we meet
a function that's described as an equation
176:05 - instead of a graph, one way to find the domain
and range are to graph the function. But it's
176:11 - often possible to find the domain at least
more quickly, by using algebraic considerations.
176:17 - We think about what x values that makes sense
to plug into this expression, and what x values
176:22 - need to be excluded, because they make the
algebraic expression impossible to evaluate.
176:27 - Specifically, to find the domain of a function,
we need to exclude x values that make the
176:35 - denominator zero. Since we can't divide by
zero,
176:38 - we also need to exclude x values that make
an expression inside a square root sign negative.
176:47 - Since we can't take the square root of a negative
number. In fact, we need to exclude values
176:52 - that make the expression inside any even root
negative because we can't take an even root
176:58 - of a negative number, even though we can take
an odd root like a cube root of a negative
177:02 - number. Later, when we look at logarithmic
functions, we'll have some additional exclusions
177:07 - that we have to make. But for now, these two
principles should handle all functions We'll
177:12 - see. So let's apply them to a couple examples.
177:16 - For the function in part A, we don't have
any square root signs, but we do have a denominator.
177:23 - So we need to exclude x values that make the
denominator zero. In other words, we need
177:28 - x squared minus 4x plus three to not be equal
to zero.
177:34 - If we solve x squared minus 4x plus three
equal to zero, we can do that by factoring.
177:42 - And that gives us x equals three or x equals
one, so we need to exclude these values.
177:48 - All other x values should be fine. So if I
draw the number line, I can put on one and
177:54 - three and just dig out a hole at both of those.
And my domain includes everything else on
178:00 - the number line. In interval notation, this
means my domain is everything from negative
178:06 - infinity to one, together with everything
from one to three, together with everything
178:12 - from three to infinity.
178:15 - In the second example, we don't have any denominator
to worry about, but we do have a square root
178:21 - sign. So we need to exclude any x values that
make three minus 2x less than zero. In other
178:29 - words, we can include all x values for which
three minus 2x is greater than or equal to
178:35 - zero. Solving that inequality gives us three
is greater than equal to 2x. In other words,
178:43 - x
178:44 - is less than or equal to three halves,
178:48 - I can draw this on the number line,
178:51 - or write it in interval notation.
178:54 - Notice that three halves is included, and
that's because three minus 2x is allowed to
179:00 - be zero, I can take the square root of zero,
that's just zero. And that's not a problem.
179:05 - Finally, let's look at a more complicated
function that involves both the square root
179:10 - and denominator. Now there are two things
I need to worry about.
179:14 - I need the denominator
179:18 - to not be equal to zero, and I need the stuff
inside the square root side to be greater
179:24 - than or equal to zero. from our earlier work,
we know the first condition means that x is
179:30 - not equal to three, and x is not equal to
one. And the second condition means that x
179:36 - is less than or equal to three halves. Let's
try both of those conditions on the number
179:41 - line.
179:44 - x is not equal to three and x is not equal
to one means we've got everything except those
179:51 - two dug out points. And the other condition
x is less than or equal to three halves means
179:56 - we can have three halves and everything
180:00 - To the left of it. Now to be in our domain
and to be legit for our function, we need
180:05 - both of these conditions to be true. So I'm
going to connect these conditions with N and
180:09 - N, that means we're looking for a numbers
on the number line that are colored both red
180:13 - and blue. So I'll draw that above in purple.
So that's everything from three halves to
180:19 - one, I have to dig out one because one was
a problem for the denominator. And then I
180:24 - can continue for all the things that are colored
both both colors red and blue. So my final
180:30 - domain is going to be, let's see negative
infinity, up to but not including one together
180:37 - with one, but not including it to three halves,
and I include three half since that was colored,
180:44 - both red and blue. Also,
180:46 - in this video, we talked about functions,
how to evaluate them, and how to find domains
180:51 - and ranges. This video gives the graphs of
some commonly used functions that I call the
180:57 - toolkit functions. The first function is the
function y equals x, let's plot a few points
181:03 - on the graph of this function. If x is zero,
y zero, if x is one, y is one, and so on y
181:13 - is always equal to x doesn't have to just
be an integer, it can be any real number,
181:19 - and we'll connecting the dots, we get a straight
line through the origin.
181:24 - Let's look at the graph of y equals x squared.
If x is zero, y is zero. So we go through
181:30 - the origin again, if x is one, y is one, and
x is negative one, y is also one,
181:40 - the x value of two gives a y value of four
and the x value of negative two gives a y
181:45 - value of four also connecting the dots, we
get a parabola.
181:51 - That is this, this function is an even function.
181:56 - That means it has mirror symmetry across the
y axis, the left side it looks like exactly
182:02 - like the mirror image of the right side. That
happens because when you square a positive
182:08 - number, like two, you get the exact same y
value as when you square it's a mirror image
182:14 - x value of negative two.
182:17 - The next function y equals x cubed. I'll call
that a cubic. Let's plot a few points when
182:24 - x is zero, y is zero. When x is one, y is
one, when x is negative one, y is negative
182:31 - one, two goes with the point eight way up
here and an x value of negative two is going
182:37 - to give us negative eight. If I connect the
dots, I get something that looks kind of like
182:42 - this.
182:45 - This function is what's called an odd function,
because it has 180 degree rotational symmetry
182:53 - occur around the origin. If I rotate this
whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other words,
182:58 - turn the paper upside down, I'll get exactly
the same shape. The reason this function has
183:04 - this odd symmetry is because when I cube a
positive number, and get its y value, I get
183:12 - n cube the corresponding negative number to
get its y value, the negative number cubed
183:17 - gives us exactly the negative of the the y
value we get with cubing the positive number.
183:25 - Let's look at the next example. Y equals the
square root of x.
183:29 - Notice that the domain of this function is
just x values bigger than or equal to zero
183:37 - because we can't take the square root of a
negative number. Let's plug in a few x values.
183:42 - X is zero gives y is 0x is one square root
of one is one, square root of four is two,
183:49 - and connecting the dots, I get a function
that looks like this.
183:55 - The absolute value function is next. Again,
if we plug in a few points, x is zero goes
184:01 - with y equals 0x is one gives us one, the
absolute value of negative one is 122 is on
184:11 - the graph, and the absolute value of negative
two is to I'm ending up getting a V shaped
184:17 - graph. It also has even or a mirror symmetry.
184:24 - Y equals two to the x is what's known as an
exponential function. That's because the variable
184:30 - x is in the exponent. If I plot a few points,
184:35 - two to the zero is one,
184:41 - two to the one is two, two squared is four,
two to the minus one is one half. I'll plot
184:49 - these on my graph, you know, let me fill in
a few more points. So let's see. two cubed
184:55 - is eight. That's way up here and negative
two gives
184:59 - Maybe 1/4 1/8 connecting the dots, I get something
that's shaped like this.
185:07 - You might have heard the expression exponential
growth, when talking about, for example, population
185:11 - growth, this is function is represents exponential
growth, it grows very, very steeply. Every
185:19 - time we increase the x coordinate by one,
we double the y coordinate.
185:26 - We could also look at a function like y equals
three dx, or sometimes y equals e to the x,
185:32 - where E is just a number about 2.7. These
functions look very similar. It's just the
185:40 - bigger bass makes us rise a little more steeply.
185:45 - Now let's look at the function y equals one
over x. It's not defined when x is zero, but
185:52 - I can plug in x equals one half, one over
one half is to
185:58 - whenever one is one, and one or two is one
half. By connect the dots, I get this shape
186:06 - in the first quadrant, but I haven't looked
at negative values of x, when x is negative,
186:11 - whenever negative one is negative one, whenever
negative half is negative two, and I get a
186:18 - similar looking piece in the third quadrant.
186:22 - This is an example of a hyperbola.
186:27 - And it's also an odd function, because it
has that 180 degree rotational symmetry, if
186:34 - I turn the page upside down, it'll look exactly
the same. Finally, let's look at y equals
186:40 - one over x squared.
186:42 - Again, it's not defined when x is zero, but
I can plug in points like one half or X, let's
186:48 - see one over one half squared is one over
1/4, which is four.
186:55 - And one over one squared, one over two squared
is a fourth, it looks pretty much like the
187:03 - previous function is just a little bit more
extreme rises a little more steeply, falls
187:08 - a little more dramatically. But for negative
values of x, something a little bit different
187:12 - goes on. For example, one over negative two
squared is just one over four, which is a
187:19 - fourth. So I can plot that point there, and
one over a negative one squared, that's just
187:27 - one. So my curve for negative values of x
is gonna lie in the second quadrant, not the
187:32 - third quadrant. This is an example of an even
function
187:38 - because it has perfect mirror symmetry across
the y axis.
187:42 - These are the toolkit functions, and I recommend
you memorize the shape of each of them.
187:49 - That way, you can draw at least a rough sketch
very quickly without having to plug in points.
187:56 - That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions.
187:58 - If we change the equation of a function, then
the graph of the function changes or transforms
188:07 - in predictable ways.
188:09 - This video gives some rules and examples for
transformations of functions. To get the most
188:14 - out of this video, it's helpful if you're
already familiar with the graph of some typical
188:19 - functions, I call them toolkit functions like
y equals square root of x, y equals x squared,
188:25 - y equals the absolute value of x and so on.
If you're not familiar with those graphs,
188:30 - I encourage you to watch my video called toolkit
functions first, before watching this one.
188:36 - I want to start by reviewing function notation.
188:39 - If g of x represents the function, the square
root of x, then we can rewrite these expressions
188:46 - in terms of square roots. For example, g of
x minus two is the same thing as the square
188:53 - root of x minus two.
188:55 - g of quantity x minus two means we plug in
x minus two, everywhere we see an x, so that
189:05 - would be the same thing as the square root
of quantity x minus two.
189:11 - In this second example, I say that we're subtracting
two on the inside of the function, because
189:16 - we're subtracting two before we apply the
square root function. Whereas on the first
189:21 - example, I say that the minus two is on the
outside of the function, we're doing the square
189:26 - root function first and then subtracting two.
In this third example, g of 3x, we're multiplying
189:33 - by three on the inside of the function. To
evaluate this in terms of square root, we
189:38 - plug in the entire 3x for x and the square
root function. That gives us the square root
189:44 - of 3x.
189:45 - In the next example, we're multiplying by
three on the outside of the function. This
189:51 - is just three times the square root of x.
Finally, g of minus x means the square root
189:58 - of minus x.
190:00 - Now, this might look a little odd because
we're not used to taking the square root of
190:03 - a negative number. But remember that if x
itself is negative, like negative to the negative
190:09 - x will be negative negative two or positive
two. So we're really be taking the square
190:13 - root of a positive number in that case, let
me record which of these are inside and which
190:18 - of these are outside of my function.
190:21 - In this next set of examples, we're using
the same function g of x squared of x. But
190:26 - this time, we're starting with an expression
with square roots in it, and trying to write
190:29 - it in terms of g of x. So the first example,
the plus 17 is on the outside of my function,
190:37 - because I'm taking the square root of x first,
and then adding 17. So I can write this as
190:43 - g of x plus 17.
190:46 - In the second example, I'm taking x and adding
12 first, then I take the square root of the
190:53 - whole thing. Since I'm adding the 12 to x
first that's on the inside of my function.
190:58 - So I write that as g of the quantity x plus
12.
191:04 - Remember that this notation means I plug in
the entire x plus 12, into the square root
191:09 - sign, which gives me exactly square root of
x plus 12. And this next example, undoing
191:14 - the square root first and then multiplying
by negative 36. So i minus 36, multiplications,
191:20 - outside my function, I can rewrite this as
minus 36 times g of x. Finally, in this last
191:27 - example, I take x multiplied by a fourth and
then apply the square root of x. So that's
191:33 - the same thing as g of 1/4 X, my 1/4 X is
on the inside of my function. In other words,
191:40 - it's inside the parentheses when I use function
notation.
191:44 - Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations
have this function,
191:50 - y equals the square root of x goes to the
point 0011. And for two, since the square
191:56 - root of four is two, it looks something like
this.
192:01 - In order to graph y equals the square root
of x minus two, notice that the minus two
192:06 - is on the outside of the function, that means
we're going to take the square root of x first
192:10 - and then subtract two. So for example, if
we start with the x value of zero, and compute
192:17 - the square root of zero, that's zero, then
we subtract two to give us a y value of negative
192:21 - two,
192:23 - an x value of one, which under the square
root function had a y value of one now has
192:29 - a y value that's decreased by two, one minus
two is negative one. And finally, an x value
192:36 - of four, which under the square root function
had a y value of two now has a y value of
192:42 - two minus two or zero, its y value is also
decreased by two. If I plot these new points,
192:49 - zero goes with negative two, one goes with
negative one, and four goes with zero, I have
192:56 - my transformed graph.
193:00 - Because I subtracted two on the outside of
my function, my y values were decreased by
193:04 - two, which brought my graph down by two units.
Next, let's look at y equals the square root
193:12 - of quantity x minus two. Now we're subtracting
two on the inside of our function, which means
193:17 - we subtract two from x first and then take
the square root. In order to get the same
193:21 - y value of zero as we had in our blue graph,
we need our x minus two to be zero, so we
193:28 - need our original x to be two.
193:30 - In order to get the y value of one that we
had in our blue graph, we need to be taking
193:36 - the square root of one, so we need x minus
two to be one, which means that we need to
193:41 - start with an x value of three.
193:43 - And in order to reproduce our y value of two
from our original graph, we need the square
193:50 - root of x minus two to be two, which means
we need to start out by taking the square
193:55 - root of four, which means our x minus two
is four, so our x should be up there at six.
194:04 - If I plot my x values, with my corresponding
y values of square root of x minus two, I
194:10 - get the following graph. Notice that the graph
has moved horizontally to the right by two
194:18 - units.
194:19 - To me, moving down by two units, makes sense
because we're subtracting two, so we're decreasing
194:25 - y's by two units, but the minus two on the
inside that kind of does the opposite of what
194:30 - I expect, I might expected to to move the
graph left, I might expect the x values to
194:35 - be going down by two units, but instead, it
moves the graph to the right,
194:41 - because the x units have to go up by two units
in order to get the right square root when
194:46 - I then subtract two units again, the observations
we made for these transformations of functions
194:52 - hold in general, according to the following
rules. First of all, numbers on the outside
194:58 - of the function like
194:59 - In our example, y equals a squared of x minus
two, those numbers affect the y values. And
195:06 - a result in vertical motions, like we saw,
these motions are in the direction you expect.
195:12 - So subtracting two was just down by two. If
we were adding two instead, that would move
195:18 - us up by two
195:19 - numbers on the inside of the function. That's
like our example, y equals the square root
195:24 - of quantity x minus two, those affect the
x values and results in a horizontal motion,
195:31 - these motions go in the opposite direction
from what you expect. Remember, the minus
195:35 - two on the inside actually shifted our graph
to the right, if it had had a plus two on
195:40 - the inside, that would actually shift our
graph to the left.
195:45 - Adding results in a shift those are called
translations, but multiplying like something
195:51 - like y equals three times the square root
of x, that would result in a stretch or shrink.
195:59 - In other words, if I start with the square
root of x,
196:03 - and then when I graph y equals three times
the square root of x, that stretches my graph
196:08 - vertically by a factor of three.
196:12 - Like this,
196:13 - if I want to graph y equals 1/3, times the
square root of x, that shrinks my graph vertically
196:20 - by a factor of 1/3.
196:22 - Finally, a negative sign results in reflection.
For example, if I start with the graph of
196:29 - y equals the square root of x, and then when
I graph y equals the square root of negative
196:34 - x, that's going to do a reflection in the
horizontal direction because the negative
196:39 - is on the inside of the square root sign.
196:42 - A reflection in the horizontal direction means
a reflection across the y axis.
196:49 - If instead, I want to graph y equals negative
A squared of x, that negative sign on the
196:53 - outside means a vertical reflection, a reflection
across the x axis.
197:00 - Pause the video for a moment and see if you
could describe what happens in these four
197:06 - transformations.
197:07 - In the first example, we're subtracting four
on the outside of the function. adding or
197:12 - subtracting means a translation or shift.
And since we're on the outside of the function
197:18 - affects the y value, so that's moving us vertically.
So this transformation should take the square
197:24 - root of graph and move it down by four units,
that would look something like this.
197:31 - In the next example, we're adding 12 on the
inside, that's still a translation. But now
197:39 - we're moving horizontally. And so since we
go the opposite direction, we expect we are
197:44 - going to go to the left by 12 units, that's
going to look something like this.
197:51 - And the next example, we're multiplying by
three and introducing a negative sign both
197:55 - on the outside of our function outside our
function means we're affecting the y values.
198:00 - So in multiplication means we're stretching
by a factor of three, the negative sign means
198:06 - we reflect in the vertical direction,
198:10 - here's stretching by a factor of three vertically,
before I apply the minus sign, and now the
198:15 - minus sign reflects in the vertical direction.
198:19 - Finally, in this last example, we're multiplying
by one quarter on the inside of our function,
198:26 - we know that multiplication means stretch
or shrink. And since we're on the inside,
198:31 - it's a horizontal motion, and it does the
opposite of what we expect. So instead of
198:36 - shrinking by a factor of 1/4, horizontally,
it's actually going to stretch by the reciprocal,
198:41 - a factor of four horizontally.
198:44 - that'll look something like this. Notice that
stretching horizontally by a factor of four
198:50 - looks kind of like shrinking vertically by
a factor of one half.
198:55 - And that's actually borne out by the algebra,
because the square root of 1/4 x is the same
199:01 - thing as the square root of 1/4 times the
square root of x, which is the same thing
199:05 - as one half times the square root of x. And
so now we can see algebraically that vertical
199:12 - shrink by a factor of one half is the same
as a horizontal stretch by a factor of four,
199:18 - at least for this function, the square root
function.
199:22 - This video gives some rules for transformations
of functions, which I'll repeat below. numbers
199:27 - on the outside correspond to changes in the
y values, or vertical motions.
199:37 - numbers on the inside of the function, affect
the x values, and result in horizontal motions.
199:44 - Adding and subtracting
199:47 - corresponds to translations or shifts.
199:52 - multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds
to stretches and shrinks
199:57 - and putting in a negative sign.
200:01 - corresponds to a reflection,
200:04 - horizontal reflection, if the negative sign
is on the inside, and a vertical reflection,
200:10 - if the negative sign is on the outside,
200:13 - knowing these basic rules about transformations
empowers you to be able to sketch graphs of
200:17 - much more complicated functions, like y equals
three times the square root of x plus two,
200:24 - by simply considering the transformations,
one at a time.
200:29 - a quadratic function is a function that can
be written in the form f of x equals A x squared
200:35 - plus bx plus c, where a, b and c are real
numbers. And a is not equal to zero. The reason
200:46 - we require that A is not equal to zero is
because if a were equal to zero, we'd have
200:53 - f of x is equal to b x plus c, which is called
a linear function. So by making sure that
201:01 - a is not zero, we make sure there's really
an x squared term which is the hallmark of
201:06 - a quadratic function.
201:08 - Please pause the video for a moment and decide
which of these equations represent quadratic
201:13 - functions.
201:15 - The first function can definitely be written
in the form g of x equals A x squared plus
201:23 - bx plus c. fact it's already written in that
form, where a is negative five, B is 10, and
201:30 - C is three.
201:32 - The second equation is also a quadratic function,
because we can think of it as f of x equals
201:39 - one times x squared plus zero times x plus
zero.
201:46 - So it is in the right form, where A is one,
B is zero, and C is zero.
201:53 - It's perfectly fine for the coefficient of
x and the constant term to be zero for a quadratic
201:59 - function, we just need the coefficient of
x squared to be nonzero, so the x squared
202:03 - term is preserved.
202:06 - The third equation is not a quadratic function.
It's a linear function, because there's no
202:13 - x squared term.
202:17 - The fourth function might not look like a
quadratic function. But if we rewrite it by
202:21 - expanding out the X minus three squared, let's
see what happens. We get y equals two times
202:28 - x minus three times x minus three plus four.
So that's two times x squared minus 3x minus
202:36 - 3x, plus nine plus four, continuing, I get
2x squared,
202:45 - minus 12 access, plus 18 plus four, in other
words, y equals 2x squared minus 12x plus
202:53 - 22. So in fact, our function can be written
in the right form, and it is a quadratic function.
203:02 - A function that is already written in the
form y equals A x squared plus bx plus c is
203:08 - said to be in standard form.
203:12 - So our first example g of x is in standard
form
203:17 - a function that's written in the format of
the last function that is in the form of y
203:23 - equals a times x minus h squared plus k for
some numbers, a, h, and K. That said to be
203:33 - in vertex form,
203:35 - I'll talk more about standard form and vertex
form in another video.
203:40 - In this video, we identified some quadratic
functions, and talked about the difference
203:45 - between standard form
203:49 - and vertex form.
203:54 - This video is about graphing quadratic functions.
a quadratic function, which is typically written
203:59 - in standard form, like this, or sometimes
in vertex form, like this, always has the
204:08 - graph that looks like a parabola.
204:11 - This video will show how to tell whether the
problem is pointing up or down. How to find
204:17 - its x intercepts, and how to find its vertex.
204:21 - The bare bones basic quadratic function is
f of x equals x squared, it goes to the origin,
204:30 - since f of zero is zero squared, which is
zero, and it is a parabola pointing upwards
204:38 - like this.
204:40 - The vertex of a parabola is its lowest point
if it's pointing upwards, and its highest
204:46 - point if it's pointing downwards. So in this
case, the vertex is at 00.
204:53 - The x intercepts are where the graph crosses
the x axis. In other words, where y is zero
204:58 - In this function, y equals zero means that
x squared is zero, which happens only when
205:05 - x is zero. So the x intercept, there's only
one of them is also zero.
205:11 - The second function, y equals negative 3x
squared also goes to the origin. Since the
205:17 - functions value when x is zero, is y equals
zero. But in this case, the parabola is pointing
205:25 - downwards.
205:27 - That's because thinking about transformations
of functions, a negative sign on the outside
205:32 - reflects the function vertically over the
x axis, making the problem instead of pointing
205:38 - upwards, reflecting the point downwards.
205:43 - The number three on the outside stretches
the graph vertically by a factor of three.
205:49 - So it makes it kind of long and skinny like
this.
205:55 - In general, a negative coefficient to the
x squared term means the problem will be pointing
206:00 - down. Whereas a positive coefficient, like
here, the coefficients, one means the parabola
206:05 - is pointing up.
206:06 - Alright, that roll over here.
206:09 - So if a is bigger than zero, the parabola
opens up.
206:16 - And if the value of the coefficient a is less
than zero, then the parabola opens down.
206:22 - In this second example, we can see again that
the vertex is at 00. And the x intercept is
206:27 - x equals zero.
206:30 - Let's look at this third example.
206:33 - If we multiplied our expression out, we'd
see that the coefficient of x squared would
206:38 - be to a positive number. So that means our
parabola is going to be opening up.
206:43 - But the vertex of this parabola will no longer
be at the origin. In fact, we can find the
206:50 - parabolas vertex by thinking about transformations
of functions.
206:55 - Our function is related to the function y
equals to x squared, by moving it to the right
207:02 - by three and up by four. Since y equals 2x
squared has a vertex at 00. If we move that
207:13 - whole parabola including the vertex, right
by three, and up by four, the vertex will
207:21 - end up at the point three, four.
207:26 - So a parabola will look something like this.
207:30 - Notice how easy it was to just read off the
vertex when our quadratic function is written
207:36 - in this form. In fact, any parabola any quadratic
function written in the form a times x minus
207:44 - h squared plus k has a vertex at h k. By the
same reasoning, we're moving the parabola
207:53 - with a vertex at the origin to the right by
H, and by K.
207:59 - That's why this form of a quadratic function
is called the vertex form.
208:06 - Notice that this parabola has no x intercepts
because it does not cross the x axis.
208:11 - For our final function, we have g of x equals
5x squared plus 10x plus three,
208:19 - we know the graph of this function will be
a parabola pointing upwards, because the coefficient
208:23 - of x squared is positive.
208:26 - To find the x intercepts, we can set y equals
zero, since the x intercepts is where our
208:32 - graph crosses the x axis, and that's where
the y value is zero.
208:37 - So zero equals 5x squared plus 10x plus three,
I'm going to use the quadratic formula to
208:43 - solve that. So x is negative 10 plus or minus
the square root of 10 squared minus four times
208:52 - five times three, all over two times five.
That simplifies to x equals negative 10 plus
208:59 - or minus the square root of 40 over 10,
209:03 - which simplifies further to x equals negative
10 over 10, plus or minus the square root
209:08 - of 40 over 10, which is negative one plus
or minus two square root of 10 over 10, or
209:16 - negative one plus or minus square root of
10 over five.
209:21 - Since the square root of 10 is just a little
bit bigger than three, this works out to approximately
209:27 - about negative two fifths and negative eight
foot or so somewhere around right here. So
209:34 - our parabola is going to look something like
this. Notice that it goes through crosses
209:40 - the x axis at y equals three, that's because
when we plug in x equals zero, and two here
209:48 - we get y equal three, so the y intercept is
at three. Finally, we can find the vertex.
209:56 - Since this function is written in standard
form,
210:00 - On the Y equals a x plus a squared plus bx
plus c form, and not in vertex form, we can't
210:10 - just read off the vertex like we couldn't
before. But there's a trick called the vertex
210:15 - formula, which says that whenever you have
a function in a quadratic function in standard
210:20 - form, the vertex has an x coordinate
210:24 - of negative B over two A. So in this case,
that's an x coordinate of negative 10 over
210:34 - two times five or negative one, which is kind
of like where I put it on the graph. To find
210:39 - the y coordinate of that vertex, I can just
plug in negative one into my equation for
210:47 - x, which gives me at y equals five times negative
one squared, plus 10, times negative one plus
210:54 - three, which is negative two.
210:59 - So I think I better redraw my graph a little
bit to put that vertex down at a y coordinate
211:04 - of negative two where it's supposed to be.
211:10 - Let's summarize the steps we use to graph
these quadratic functions. First of all, the
211:15 - graph of a quadratic function has the shape
of a parabola.
211:19 - The parabola opens up, if the coefficient
of x squared, which we'll call a is greater
211:27 - than zero and down if a is less than zero.
To find the x intercepts, we set y equal to
211:34 - zero, or in other words, f of x equal to zero
and solve for x, the find the vertex, we can
211:44 - either read it off as h k, if our function
is in vertex form,
211:53 - or we can use the vertex formula
211:57 - and get the x coordinate
212:01 - of the vertex to be negative B over to a if
our function is in standard form.
212:10 - To find the y coordinate of the vertex in
this case, we just plug in the x coordinate
212:19 - and figure out what y is.
212:21 - Finally, we can always find additional points
on the graph by plugging in values of x.
212:29 - In this video, we learned some tricks for
graphing quadratic functions. In particular,
212:34 - we saw that the vertex can be read off as
h k, if our function is written in vertex
212:43 - form, and the x coordinate of the vertex can
be calculated
212:50 - as negative B over two A, if our function
is in standard form. For an explanation of
212:57 - why this vertex formula works, please see
the my other video.
213:02 - a quadratic and standard form looks like y
equals A x squared plus bx plus c, where a,
213:09 - b and c are real numbers, and a is not zero.
a quadratic function in vertex form looks
213:16 - like y equals a times x minus h squared plus
k, where a h and k are real numbers, and a
213:24 - is not zero. When a functions in vertex form,
it's easy to read off the vertex is just the
213:30 - ordered pair, H, okay.
213:34 - This video explains how to get from vertex
form two standard form and vice versa.
213:40 - Let's start by converting this quadratic function
from vertex form to standard form. That's
213:46 - pretty straightforward, we just have to distribute
out.
213:50 - So if I multiply out the X minus three squared,
213:58 - I get minus four times x squared minus 6x
plus nine plus one, distributing the negative
214:07 - four, I get negative 4x squared plus 24x minus
36 plus one. So that works out to minus 4x
214:16 - squared plus 24x minus 35. And I have my quadratic
function now in standard form.
214:26 - Now let's go the other direction and convert
a quadratic function that's already in standard
214:31 - form into vertex form. That is, we want to
put it in the form of g of x equals a times
214:40 - x minus h squared plus k, where the vertex
is at h k. To do this, it's handy to use the
214:51 - vertex formula.
214:53 - The vertex formula says that the x coordinate
of the vertex is given by negative
215:00 - over to a, where A is the coefficient of x
squared, and B is the coefficient of x. So
215:08 - in this case, we get an x coordinate of negative
eight over two times two or negative two.
215:16 - To find the y coordinate of the vertex, we
just plug in the x coordinate into our formula
215:24 - for a g of x. So that's g of negative two,
which is two times negative two squared plus
215:30 - eight times negative two plus six. And that
works out to be negative two by coincidence.
215:37 - So the vertex for our quadratic function has
coordinates negative two, negative two. And
215:44 - if I want to write g of x in vertex form,
it's going to be a times x minus negative
215:50 - two squared plus minus two. That's because
remember, we subtract H and we add K. So that
216:00 - simplifies to g of x equals a times x plus
two squared minus two. And finally, we just
216:08 - need to figure out what this leading coefficient
as. But notice, if we were to multiply, distribute
216:14 - this out, then the coefficient of x squared
would end up being a. So therefore, the coefficient
216:23 - of x squared here, which is a has to be the
same as the coefficient of x squared here,
216:27 - which we conveniently also called a, in other
words, are a down here needs to be two. So
216:33 - I'm going to write that as g of x equals two
times x plus two squared minus two, lots of
216:39 - twos in this problem. And that's our quadratic
function in vertex form. If I want to check
216:46 - my answer, of course, I could just distribute
out again, I'd get two times x squared plus
216:53 - 4x, plus two, minus two, in other words, 2x
squared plus 8x plus six, which checks out
217:03 - to exactly what I started with. This video
showed how to get from vertex form to standard
217:09 - form by distributing out and how to get from
standard form to vertex form by finding the
217:14 - vertex using the vertex formula.
217:17 - Suppose you have a quadratic function in the
form y equals x squared plus bx plus c, and
217:26 - you want to find where the vertex is, when
you graph it.
217:31 - The vertex formula says that the x coordinate
of this vertex is that negative B over two
217:40 - A,
217:42 - this video gives a justification for where
that formula comes from.
217:47 - Let's start with a specific example. Suppose
I wanted to find the x intercepts and the
217:53 - vertex for this quadratic function. To find
the x intercepts, I would set y equal to zero
218:00 - and solve for x. So that's zero equals 3x
squared plus 7x minus five. And to solve for
218:07 - x, I use the quadratic formula. So x is going
to be negative seven plus or minus the square
218:13 - root of seven squared minus four times three
times negative five, all over two times three.
218:22 - That simplifies to negative seven plus or
minus a squared of 109 over six, we could,
218:29 - I could also write this as negative seven,
six, plus the square root of 109 over six,
218:35 - or x equals negative seven, six minus the
square root of 109 over six, since the square
218:41 - root of 109 is just a little bit bigger than
10, this can be approximated by negative seven
218:47 - six plus 10, six, and negative seven, six
minus 10, six.
218:54 - So pretty close to, I guess about what half
over here and pretty close to about negative
219:00 - three over here, I'm just going to estimate
so that I can draw a picture of the function.
219:06 - Since the leading coefficient three is positive,
I know my parabola is going to be opening
219:11 - up and the intercepts are somewhere around
here and here. So roughly speaking, it's gonna
219:20 - look something like this.
219:25 - Now the vertex is going to be somewhere in
between the 2x intercepts, in fact, it's going
219:30 - to be by symmetry, it'll be exactly halfway
in between the 2x intercepts. Since the x
219:37 - intercepts are negative seven, six plus and
minus 100 squared of 109 over six, the number
219:43 - halfway in between those is going to be exactly
negative seven, six,
219:47 - right, because on the one hand, I have negative
seven six plus something. And on the other
219:56 - hand, I have negative seven six minus that
same thing.
219:59 - So negative seven, six will be exactly in
the middle. So my x coordinate of my vertex
220:08 - will be at negative seven sex. Notice that
I got that number from the quadratic formula.
220:16 - More generally, if I want to find the x intercepts
for any quadratic function, I set y equal
220:24 - to zero
220:27 - and solve for x using the quadratic formula,
negative b plus or minus the square root of
220:33 - b squared minus four AC Oliver to a, b, x
intercepts will be at these two values, but
220:40 - the x coordinate of the vertex, which is exactly
halfway in between the 2x intercepts will
220:47 - be at negative B over two A. That's where
the vertex formula comes from.
220:53 - And it turns out that this formula works even
when there are no x intercepts, even when
220:58 - the quadratic formula gives us no solutions.
That vertex still has the x coordinate, negative
221:04 - B over two A.
221:06 - And that's the justification of the vertex
formula.
221:11 - This video is about polynomials and their
graphs.
221:14 - We call that a polynomial is a function like
this one, for example.
221:20 - His terms are numbers times powers of x. I'll
start with some definitions. The degree of
221:28 - a polynomial is the largest exponent. For
example, for this polynomial, the degree is
221:35 - for
221:37 - the leading term is the term with the largest
exponent. In the same example, the leading
221:44 - term is 5x to the fourth, it's conventional
to write the polynomial in descending order
221:51 - of powers of x. So the leading term is first.
But the leading term doesn't have to be the
221:56 - first term. If I wrote the same polynomial
as y equals, say, two minus 17x minus 21x
222:04 - cubed plus 5x. Fourth, the leading term would
still be the 5x to the fourth, even though
222:11 - it was last.
222:13 - The leading coefficient is the number in the
leading term. In this example, the leading
222:20 - coefficient is five.
222:21 - Finally, the constant term is the term with
no x's in it. In our same example, the constant
222:28 - term is to
222:29 - please pause the video for a moment and take
a look at this next example of polynomial
222:34 - figure out what's the degree the leading term,
the leading coefficient and the constant term.
222:40 - The degree is again, four, since that's the
highest power we have, and the leading term
222:48 - is negative 7x. to the fourth, the leading
coefficient is negative seven, and the constant
222:56 - term is 18.
222:58 - In the graph of the polynomial Shown here
are the three marks points are called turning
223:04 - points, because the polynomial turns around
and changes direction at those three points,
223:12 - those same points can also be called local
extreme points, or they can be called local
223:18 - maximum and minimum points. For this polynomial,
the degree is four, and the number of turning
223:25 - points is three.
223:28 - Let's compare the degree and the number of
turning points for these next three examples.
223:33 - For the first one, the degree is to and there's
one turning point.
223:39 - For the second example, that agree, is three,
and there's two turning points.
223:50 - And for this last example, the degree is four,
and there's one turning point.
223:56 - For this first example, and the next two,
the number of turning points is exactly one
224:01 - less than the degree. So you might conjecture
that this is always true. But in fact, this
224:07 - is not always true. In this last example,
the degree is four, but the number of turning
224:13 - points is one, not three.
224:16 - In fact, it turns out that while the number
of turning points is not always equal to a
224:21 - minus one, it is always less than or equal
to the degree minus one. That's a useful factor.
224:28 - Remember, when you're sketching graphs are
recognizing graphs of polynomials.
224:33 - The end behavior of a function is how the
ends of the function look, as x gets bigger
224:39 - and bigger heads towards infinity, or x gets
goes through larger and larger negative numbers
224:45 - towards negative infinity.
224:47 - In this first example, the graph of the function
goes down as x gets towards infinity as x
224:54 - goes towards negative infinity. I can draw
this with two little arrows pointing
224:59 - Down on either side, or I can say in words,
that the function is falling as we had left
225:05 - and falling also as we had right.
225:09 - In the second example, the graph rises to
the left and rises to the right. In the third
225:16 - example, the graph falls to the left, but
rises to the right. And in the fourth example,
225:23 - it rises to the left and falls to the right.
If you study these examples, and others, you
225:29 - might notice there's a relationship between
the degree of the polynomial the leading coefficients
225:36 - of the polynomials and the end behavior. Specifically,
these four types of end behavior are determined
225:44 - by whether the degree is even or odd. And
by whether the leading coefficient is positive
225:51 - or negative.
225:54 - When the degree is even, and the leading coefficient
is positive, like in this example, where the
226:00 - leading coefficient is one, we have this sorts
of n behavior rising on both sides.
226:08 - When the degree is even at the leading coefficient
is negative, like in this example, we have
226:14 - the end behavior that's falling on both sides
226:18 - when the degree is odd, and the leading coefficient
is positive, that's like this example, with
226:23 - the degree three and the leading coefficient
three, then we have this sort of end behavior.
226:30 - And finally, when the degree is odd, and the
leading coefficient is negative, like in this
226:35 - example, we have this sort of NBA havior.
226:40 - I like to remember this chart just by thinking
of the most simple examples, y equals x squared,
226:48 - y equals negative x squared, y equals x cubed,
and y equals negative x cubed. Because I know
226:55 - by heart what those four examples look like,
227:00 - then I just have to remember that any polynomial
with a even degree and positive leading coefficient
227:08 - has the same end behavior as x squared.
227:11 - And similarly, any polynomial with even degree
and negative leading coefficient has the same
227:18 - end behavior as negative x squared. And similar
statements for x cubed and negative x cubed.
227:25 - We can use facts about turning points and
behavior, to say something about the equation
227:30 - of a polynomial just by looking at this graph.
227:34 - In this example, because of the end behavior,
we know that the degree is odd,
227:42 - we know that the leading coefficient
227:46 - must be positive.
227:49 - And finally, since there are 1234, turning
points, we know that the degree is greater
227:58 - than or equal to five.
228:01 - That's because the number of turning points
is less than or equal to the degree minus
228:06 - one. And in this case, the number of turning
points we said was four.
228:10 - And so solving that inequality, we get the
degree is bigger than equal to five.
228:18 - Put in some of that information together,
we see the degree could be
228:23 - five, or seven, or nine, or any odd number
greater than or equal to five. But it couldn't
228:31 - be for example, three or six. Because even
numbers and and also numbers less than five
228:38 - are right out.
228:41 - This video gave a lot of definitions, including
the definition of degree
228:46 - leading coefficients,
228:49 - turning points,
228:51 - and and behavior.
228:54 - We saw that knowing the degree and the leading
coefficient can help you make predictions
228:59 - about the number of turning points and the
end behavior, as well as vice versa.
229:06 - This video is about exponential functions
and their graphs.
229:11 - an exponential function is a function that
can be written in the form f of x equals a
229:16 - times b to the x, where a and b are any real
numbers. As long as a is not zero, and B is
229:24 - positive.
229:26 - It's important to notice that for an exponential
function, the variable x is in the exponent.
229:33 - This is different from many other functions
we've seen, for example, quite a quadratic
229:37 - function like f of x equals 3x squared has
the variable in the base, so it's not an exponential
229:44 - function.
229:45 - For exponential functions, f of x equals a
times b dx. We require that A is not equal
229:53 - to zero, because otherwise, we would have
f of x equals zero times b dx.
230:00 - Which just means that f of x equals zero.
And this is called a constant function, not
230:04 - an exponential function. Because f of x is
always equal to zero
230:11 - in an exponential function, but we require
that B is bigger than zero, because otherwise,
230:17 - for example, if b is equal to negative one,
say, we'd have f of x equals a times negative
230:27 - one to the x. Now, this would make sense for
a lot of values of x. But if we try to do
230:34 - something like f of one half, with our Bs,
negative one, that would be the same thing
230:40 - as a times the square root of negative one,
which is not a real number,
230:45 - we'd get the same problem for other values
of b, if the values of b were negative. And
230:52 - if we tried b equals zero, we'd get a kind
of ridiculous thing a times zero to the x,
230:59 - which again is always zero. So that wouldn't
count as an exponential either. So we can't
231:03 - use any negative basis, and we can't use zero
basis, if we want an exponential function.
231:09 - The number A in the expression f of x equals
a times b to the x is called the initial value.
231:18 - And the number B is called the base.
231:21 - The phrase initial value comes from the fact
that if we plug in x equals zero, we get a
231:28 - times b to the zero, well, anything to the
zero is just one. So this is equal to A. In
231:34 - other words, f of zero equals a. So if we
think of starting out,
231:40 - when x equals zero, we get the y value
231:44 - of a, that's why it's called the initial value.
231:51 - Let's start out with this example, where y
equals a times b to the x next special function,
231:59 - and we've set a equal to one and B equals
a two. Notice that the y intercept, the value
232:06 - when x is zero, is going to be one.
232:09 - If I change my a value, my initial value,
the y intercept changes, the function is stretched
232:20 - out.
232:21 - If I make the value of a go to zero, and then
negative,
232:27 - then my initial value becomes negative, and
my graph flips across the x axis. Let's go
232:35 - back to an a value of say one, and see what
happens when we change B. Right now, the B
232:41 - value the basis two, if I increase B, my y
intercept sticks at one, but my graph becomes
232:52 - steeper and steeper. If I put B back down
close to one, my graph becomes more flat at
233:03 - exactly one, my graph is just a constant.
233:05 - As B gets into fractional territory, point
8.7 point six, my graph starts to slope the
233:14 - other way, it's decreasing now instead of
increasing, but notice that the y intercept
233:20 - still hasn't changed, I can get it more and
more steep as my B gets farther and farther
233:26 - away from one of course, when B goes to negative
territory, my graph doesn't make any sense.
233:33 - So a changes the y intercept, and B changes
the steepness of the graph. So that it's added
233:44 - whether it's increasing for B values bigger
than one, and decreasing for values of the
233:50 - less than one.
233:55 - we'll summarize all these observations on
the next slide.
233:58 - We've seen that for an exponential function,
y equals a times b to the x, the parameter
234:04 - or number a gives the y intercept, the parameter
B tells us how the graph is increasing or
234:13 - decreasing. Specifically, if b is greater
than one, the graph is increasing.
234:19 - And if b is less than one, the graph is decreasing.
234:23 - The closer B is to the number one, the flatter
the graph.
234:29 - So for example, if I were to graph y equals
point two five to the x and y equals point
234:37 - four to the x, they would both be decreasing
graphs, since the base for both of them is
234:44 - less than one. But point two five is farther
away from one and point four is closer to
234:52 - one. So point four is going to be flatter.
And point two five is going to be more steep.
234:58 - So in this picture,
This red graph would correspond to point two
235:03 - five to the x, and the blue graph would correspond
to point four to the x. For all these exponential
235:11 - functions, whether the graphs are decreasing
or increasing, they all have a horizontal
235:17 - asymptote along the x axis. In other words,
at the line at y equals zero, the domain is
235:25 - always from negative infinity to infinity,
and the range is always from zero to infinity,
235:34 - because the range is always positive y values.
Actually, that's true. If a is greater than
235:43 - zero, if a is less than zero, then our graph
flips over the x axis, our domain stays the
235:52 - same, but our range becomes negative infinity
to zero. The most famous exponential function
235:59 - is f of x equals e to the x. This function
is also sometimes written as f of x equals
236:04 - x of x. The number E is Oilers number as approximately
2.7. This function has important applications
236:13 - to calculus and to some compound interest
problems. In this video, we looked at exponential
236:21 - functions, functions of the form a times b
to the x, where the variable is in the exponent,
236:28 - we saw that they all have the same general
shape, either increasing like this, or decreasing
236:37 - like this, unless a is negative, in which
case they flip over the x axis. They all have
236:45 - a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero, the
x axis. In this video, we'll use exponential
236:55 - functions to model real world examples. Let's
suppose you're hired for a job. The starting
237:02 - salary is $40,000. With a guaranteed annual
raise of 3% each year, how much will your
237:10 - salary be after one year, two years, five
years. And in general after two years, let
237:16 - me chart out the information. The left column
will be the number of years since you're hired.
237:23 - And the right column will be your salary.
When you start work, at zero years after you're
237:30 - hired, your salary will be $40,000. After
one year, you'll have gotten a 3% raise. So
237:40 - your salary will be the original 40,000 plus
3% of 40,000.03 times 40,000. I can think
237:52 - of this first number as one at times 40,000.
And I can factor out the 40,000 from both
238:00 - terms, to get 40,000 times one plus 0.03.
we rewrite this as 40,000 times 1.03. This
238:15 - is your original salary multiplied by a growth
factor of 1.03. After two years, you'll get
238:26 - a 3% raise from your previous year salary,
your previous year salary was 40,000 times
238:33 - 1.03.
238:34 - But you'll add
238:36 - 3% of that, again, I can think of the first
number is one times 40,000 times 1.03. And
238:45 - I can factor out the common factor of 40,000
times 1.03 from both terms, to get 40,000
238:53 - times 1.03 times one plus 0.03. Let me rewrite
that as 40,000 times 1.03 times 1.03 or 40,000
239:08 - times 1.3 squared. We can think of this as
your last year salary multiplied by the same
239:19 - growth factor of 1.03. After three years,
a similar computation will give you that your
239:26 - new salary is your previous year salary times
that growth factor of 1.03 that can be written
239:37 - as 40,000 times 1.03 cubed. And in general,
if you're noticing the pattern, after two
239:45 - years, your salary should be 40,000 times
1.03 to the t power. In other words, your
239:53 - salary after two years is your original salary
multiplied By the growth factor of 1.03, taken
240:06 - to the t power, let me write this as a formula
s of t, where S of t is your salary is equal
240:15 - to 40,000 times 1.03 to the T. This is an
exponential function, that is a function of
240:24 - the form a times b to the T, where your initial
value a is 40,000 and your base b is 1.03.
240:38 - Notice that your base is the amount that your
salary gets multiplied by each year. Given
240:45 - this formula, we can easily figure out what
your salary will be after, for example, five
240:49 - years by plugging in five for T. I worked
that out on my calculator to be $46,370.96
241:01 - to the nearest cent. exponential functions
are also useful in modeling population growth.
241:08 - The United Nations estimated that the world
population in 2010 was 6.7 9 billion growing
241:15 - at a rate of 1.1% per year. Assuming that
the growth rate stayed the same and will continue
241:20 - to stay the same, we'll write an equation
for the population at t years after the year
241:26 - 2010 1.1%, written as a decimal is 0.011.
So if we work out a chart as before, we see
241:39 - that after zero years since 2010, we have
our initial population 6.7 9 billion, after
241:46 - one year, we'll take that 6.7 9 billion and
add 1.1% of it. That is point 011 times 6.79.
241:59 - This works out to 6.79 times one plus point
011 or 6.79 times 1.011. Here we have our
242:15 - initial population of 6.7 9 billion, and our
growth factor of 1.011. That's how much the
242:27 - population got multiplied by in one year.
As before, we can work out that after two
242:35 - years, our population becomes 6.79 times 1.011
squared, since they got multiplied by 1.011,
242:45 - twice, and after two years, it'll be 6.79
times 1.011 to the t power. So our function
242:56 - that models population is going to be 6.79
times 1.011 to the T. Here, t represents time
243:09 - in years, since 2010. Just for fun, I'll plug
in t equals 40. That's 40 years since 2010.
243:21 - So that's the year 2050. And I get 6.79 times
1.011 to the 40th power, which works out to
243:31 - 10 point 5 billion. That's the prediction
based on this exponential model.
243:40 - The previous two examples were examples of
exponential growth. This last example is an
243:45 - example of exponential decay. The drugs Seroquel
is metabolized and eliminated from the body
243:51 - at a rate of 11% per hour. If 400 milligrams
are given how much remains in the body. 24
243:58 - hours later, I'll chart out my information
where the left column will be time in hours
244:09 - since the dose was given, and the right column
will be the number of milligrams of Seroquel
244:15 - still on the body. zero hours after the dose
is given, we have the full 400 milligrams
244:22 - in the body. One hour later, we have the formula
100 milligrams minus 11% of it, that's minus
244:30 - point one one times 400. If I factor out the
400 from both terms, I get 400 times one minus
244:40 - 0.11 or 400 times point eight nine. The 400
represents the initial amount. The point eight
244:53 - nine I'll call the growth factor, even though
in this case the quantity is decreasing, not
244:58 - growing. So really it's kind of a shrink factor.
Let's see what happens after two hours. Now
245:08 - I'll have 400 times 0.89 my previous amount,
it'll again get multiplied by point eight,
245:15 - nine, so that's going to be 400 times 0.89
squared. And in general, after t hours, I'll
245:22 - have 400 multiplied by this growth or shrinkage
factor of point eight nine, raised to the
245:29 - t power. Since each hour, the amount of Seroquel
gets multiplied by point eight, nine, that
245:36 - number less than one. All right, my exponential
decay function as f of t equals 400 times
245:44 - 0.89 to the T, where f of t represents the
number of milligrams of Seroquel in the body.
245:54 - And t represents the number of hours since
the dose was given. To find out how much is
246:01 - in the body after 24 hours, I just plug in
24 for t. This works out to about 24.4 milligrams,
246:13 - I hope you notice the common form for the
functions used to model all three of these
246:17 - examples. The functions are always in the
form f of t equals a times b to the T, where
246:26 - a represented the initial amount, and B represented
the growth factor. To find the growth factor
246:36 - B, we started with the percent increase or
decrease. We wrote it as a decimal. And then
246:45 - we either added or subtracted it from one,
depending on whether the quantity was increasing
246:50 - or decreasing. Let me show you that as a couple
examples. In the first example, we had a percent
246:58 - increase of 3% on the race as a decimal, I'll
call this r, this was point O three. And to
247:09 - get the growth factor, we added that to one
to get 1.03. In the world population example,
247:16 - we had a 1.1% increase, we wrote this as point
011 and added it to one to get 1.011. In the
247:29 - drug example, we had a decrease of 11%. We
wrote that as a decimal. And we subtracted
247:42 - the point one one from one to get 0.89. In
fact, you can always write the growth factor
247:50 - B as one plus the percent change written as
a decimal. If you're careful to make that
247:58 - percent change, negative when the quantity
is decreasing and positive when the quantity
248:04 - is increasing. Since here one plus negative
point 11
248:09 - gives us the correct growth factor of point
eight nine which is less than one as a good
248:14 - check. Remember that if your quantity is increasing,
the base b should be bigger than one. And
248:23 - if the quantity is decreasing, then B should
be less than one.
248:30 - exponential functions can also be used to
model bank accounts and loans with compound
248:35 - interest, as we'll see in another video. This
video is about interpreting exponential functions.
248:42 - An antique car is worth $50,000 now, and its
value increases by 7%. Each year, let's write
248:49 - an equation to model its value x years from
now. After one year, it's value is the 50,000
249:00 - plus 0.07 times the 50,000. That's because
its value has grown by 7% or point oh seven
249:10 - times 50,000. this can be written as 50,000
times one plus point O seven. Notice that
249:20 - adding 7% to the original value is the same
as multiplying the original value by one plus
249:28 - point oh seven or by 1.07. After two years,
the value will be 50,000 times one plus 0.07
249:41 - squared, or 50,000 times 1.07 squared. That's
because the previous year's value is multiplied
249:51 - again by 1.7. In general, after x years We
have x, the antique cars value will be 50,000
250:06 - times 1.07 to the x. That's because the original
value of 50,000 gets multiplied by 1.07x times
250:16 - one time for each year. If we dissect this
equation, we see that the number of 50,000
250:24 - comes from the original value of the car.
The one point is seven, which I call the growth
250:29 - factor comes from one plus point 707. The
point O seven being the, the percent increase
250:41 - written as a decimal. So the form of this
equation is an exponential equation, V of
250:50 - x equals a times b to the x, where A is the
initial value, and B is the growth factor.
250:57 - But we could also write this as a times one
plus r to the x, where A is still the initial
251:06 - value,
251:07 - but
251:08 - R is the percent increase written as a decimal.
This same equation will come up in the next
251:15 - example, here, my Toyota Prius is worth only
3000. Now, and its value is decreasing by
251:22 - 5% each year. So after one year, its value
will be 3000 minus 0.05 times 3000. That is
251:34 - 3000 times one minus 0.05. I can also write
that as 3000 times 0.95. Decreasing the value
251:48 - by 5% is like multiplying the value by one
minus point oh five, or by point nine, five.
252:00 - After two years, the value will be multiplied
by point nine five again. So the value will
252:08 - be 3000 times point nine, five squared. And
after x years, the value will be 3000 times
252:17 - point nine five to the x. So my equation for
the value is 3000 times point nine five to
252:26 - the x. This is again, an equation of the form
V of x equals a times b to the x, where here,
252:36 - a is 3000, the initial value, and B is point
nine, five, I'll still call that the growth
252:47 - factor, even though we're actually declining
value not growing. Now remember where this
252:53 - point nine five came from, it came from taking
one and subtracting point 05, because of the
253:01 - 5%, decrease in value, so I can again, write
my equation in the form a times well, this
253:09 - time times one minus r to the x, where R is
our point 05. That's our percent decrease
253:19 - written as a decimal. Please take a moment
to study this equation and the previous one.
253:26 - They say that when you have an exponential
function, the number here is the initial value.
253:35 - If it's written in this form, B is your growth
factor. But you can think of B as being either
253:42 - one minus r, where r is the percent decrease,
or one plus r, where r is the percent increase.
253:50 - In this example, we're given a function f
of x to model the number of bacteria in a
253:55 - petri dish x hours after 12 o'clock noon,
we want to know what was the number of bacteria
254:03 - at noon, and by what percent, the number of
bacteria is increasing every hour, we can
254:09 - see from the equation that the number of bacteria
is increasing and not decreasing, because
254:14 - the base of the exponential function 1.45
is bigger than one. Notice that our equation
254:21 - f of x equals 12 times 1.45 to the X has the
form of a times b to the x, or we can think
254:30 - of it as a times one plus r to the x. Here
a is 12, b is 1.45 and r is 0.45. Based on
254:43 - this familiar form, we can recognize that
the initial amount of bacteria is going to
254:49 - be 12 12,000. Since those are our units and
this value 1.45 is our growth factor. What
255:00 - the number of bacteria is multiplied by each
hour? Well are the point four five is the
255:08 - the rate of increase, in other words, a 45%
increase each hour. So our answers to the
255:18 - questions are 12,045%. In this example, the
population of salamanders is modeled by this
255:29 - exponential function, where x is the number
of years since 2015. Notice that the number
255:37 - of salamanders is decreasing, because the
base of our exponential function point seven,
255:42 - eight is less than one. So if we recognize
the form of our exponential function, a times
255:50 - b to the x, or we can think of this as a times
one minus r to the x, where A is our initial
255:59 - value, and r is our percent decrease written
as a decimal.
256:08 - Our initial value is 3000. So that's the number
of salamanders zero years after 2015. Our
256:18 - growth factor B is 0.78. But if I write that
as one minus r, I see that R has to be one
256:27 - minus 0.78, or 0.22. In other words, our population
is decreasing by 22% each year. In this video,
256:40 - we saw that exponential functions can be written
in the form f of x equals a times b to the
256:47 - x, where A is the initial value. And B is
the growth factor. We also saw that they can
256:58 - be written in the form a times one plus r
to the x when the amount is increasing. And
257:05 - as a times one minus r to the x when the amount
is decreasing. In this format, R is the percent
257:16 - increase or the percent decrease written as
a decimal. So 15% increase will be an R value
257:28 - of 0.15 and a growth factor B of 1.15. Whereas
a 12% decrease will be an R value of point
257:43 - one, two, and a B value of one minus point
one, two, or 0.7. Sorry, 0.88. These observations
257:55 - help us quickly interpret exponential functions.
For example, here, we have an initial value
258:03 - of 100 and a 15% increase. And here, we have
an initial value of 50 and a 40%. decrease.
258:17 - exponential functions can be used to model
compound interest for loans and bank accounts.
258:23 - Suppose you invest $200 in a bank account
that earns 3% interest every year. If you
258:30 - make no deposits or withdrawals, how much
money will you have accumulated after 10 years,
258:37 - because 3% of the money that's in the bank
is getting added each year, the money in the
258:41 - bank gets multiplied by 1.03 each year. So
after one year, the amount will be 200 times
258:51 - 1.3, after two years 200 times one point O
three squared, and and after t years 200 times
259:02 - one point O three to the t power. So the function
modeling the amount of money, I'll call it
259:08 - P of t is given by 200 times 1.03 to the T.
More generally, if you invest a dollars
259:20 - at an annual interest rate of our for t years.
In the end, you'll have P of t equals a times
259:32 - one plus r to the T
259:37 - here r needs to be written as a decimal, so
0.03 In our example, for the 3% annual interest
259:45 - rate. Going back to our specific example,
After 10 years, the amount of money is going
259:51 - to be P of 10 which is 200 times 1.03 to the
10 which works out to 206 $68.78 to the nearest
260:03 - cent. In this problem, we've assumed that
the interest accumulates once per year. But
260:10 - in the next few examples, we'll see what happens
when the interest rate accumulates more frequently,
260:14 - twice a year, or every month. For example,
let's deposit $300 in an account that earns
260:23 - 4.5% annual interest compounded semi annually,
this means two times a year or every six months.
260:31 - A 4.5% annual interest rate compounded two
times a year means that we're actually getting
260:40 - 4.5 over 2% interest, every time the interest
is compounded. That is every six months. That's
260:53 - 2.25% interest every half a year. Note that
2.25% is the same as 0.02 to five as a decimal.
261:05 - So every time we earn interest, our money
gets multiplied by 1.02 to five. Let me make
261:17 - a chart of what happens. After zero years,
which is also zero half years, we have our
261:25 - original $300. for half a year, that's one
half year, our money gets earns interest one
261:33 - time, so we multiply the 300 by 1.02 to five,
after one year, that's two half years, our
261:42 - money earns interest two times. So we multiply
300 by 1.0225 squared. continuing this way,
261:52 - after 1.5 years, that's three half years,
we have 300 times 1.02 to five cubed. And
262:01 - after two years or four half years, we have
300 times 1.02 to five to the fourth. In general,
262:09 - after t years, which is to T half years, our
money will grow to 300 times 1.02 to five
262:20 - to the two t power. Because we've compounded
interest to tee times our formula for our
262:28 - amount of money is P of t equals 300 times
one point O two to five to the two t where
262:35 - t is the number of years. To finish the problem,
after seven years, we'll have P of $7, which
262:45 - is 300 times 1.02 to five to the two times
seven or 14 power. And that works out to $409.65
262:59 - to the nearest cent. In this next example,
we're going to take out a loan for $1,200
263:06 - in annual interest rate of 6% compounded monthly.
Although loans and bank accounts might feel
263:14 - different, they're mathematically the same.
It's like from the bank's point of view, they're
263:19 - investing money in you and getting interest
on their money from you. So we can work them
263:25 - out with the same kind of math 6% annual interest
rate compounded monthly means you're compounding
263:36 - 12 times a year. So each time you compound
interest, you're just going to get six over
263:42 - 12% interest. That's point 5% interest. And
as a decimal, that's 0.005. Let's try it out
263:56 - again, what happens. Time is zero, of course,
you'll have the original loan amount of 1200.
264:05 - After one year, that's 12 months, your loan
has had interest added to it 12 times so it
264:15 - gets multiplied by 1.05 to the 12th.
264:22 - After two years, that's 24 months, it's had
interest added to it 24 times, so it gets
264:30 - multiplied by 1.05 to the 24th power. Similarly,
after three years or 36 months, your loan
264:39 - amount will be 1200 times 1.05 to the 36th
power. And in general, after two years, that's
264:49 - 12 t months. So the interest will be compounded
12 t times and so we have to raise the 1.05
264:59 - To the 12 t power. This gives us the general
formula for the money owed is P of t equals
265:08 - 1200 times 1.05 to the 12 T, where T is the
number of years. In particular, after three
265:20 - years, we'll have to pay back a total of 1200
times 1.05 to the 12 times three or 36 power,
265:31 - which works out to $1,436.02 to the nearest
cent. These last two problems follow a general
265:42 - pattern. If A is the initial amount of the
loan or bank account, and r is the annual
265:51 - interest rate, compounded n times per year,
then our formula for the amount of money is
266:03 - going to be a times one plus r over n to the
n t. This formula exactly matches what we
266:13 - did in this problem. First, we took the interest
rate our which was 6%, and divided it by the
266:20 - number of compounding periods each year 12.
We wrote that as a decimal and added one to
266:25 - it. That's where we got the 1.05 from. We
raised this to not to the number of years,
266:35 - but to 12 times the number of years. That's
the number of compounding periods per year,
266:39 - times the number of years. And we multiplied
all that by the initial amount of money, which
266:46 - was 1200. This formula for compound interest
is a good one to memorize. But it's also important
266:52 - to be able to reason your way through it,
like we did in this chart. There's one more
266:57 - type of compound interest. And that's interest
compounded continuously. You can think of
267:02 - continuous compounding as the limit of compounding
more and more frequently 10 times a year,
267:09 - 100 times a year 1000 times a year a million
times a year. In the limit, you get continuous
267:14 - compounding. The formula for continuous compounding
is P of t equals a times e to the RT, where
267:24 - p of t is the amount of money, t is the time
in years. A is the initial amount of money.
267:37 - And R is the annual interest rate written
as a decimal. So 0.025 in this problem from
267:49 - the 2.5% annual interest rate. He represents
the famous constant Oilers constant, which
267:57 - is about 2.718. So in this problem, we have
P of t is 4000 times e to the 0.025 T. And
268:12 - after five years, we'll have P of five, which
is 4000 times e to the 0.0 to five times five,
268:21 - which works out to $4,532.59 to the nearest
cent. To summarize, if R represents the annual
268:32 - interest rate written as a decimal, that is
2% would be 0.02. And t represents the number
268:43 - of years and a represents the initial amount
of money, then for just simple annual interest
268:50 - compounded once a year. Our formula is P of
t is a times one plus r to the T for compound
269:00 - interest compounded n times per year. Our
formula is P of t is a times one plus r over
269:08 - n to the n T. And for compound interest compounded
continuously, we get P of t is a times e to
269:16 - the RT.
269:18 - In this video, we looked at three kinds of
compound interest problems, simple annual
269:24 - interest, interest compounded and times per
year, and continuously compounded interest.
269:33 - This video introduces logarithms. logarithms
are a way of writing exponents. The expression
269:42 - log base a of B equals c means that a to the
C equals b. In other words, log base a of
269:52 - B is the exponent that you raise a to to get
BE THE NUMBER A It is called the base of the
270:02 - logarithm. It's also called the base when
we write it in this exponential form. Some
270:07 - students find it helpful to remember this
relationship. log base a of B equals c means
270:14 - a to the C equals b, by drawing arrows,
270:17 - a to the C equals b.
270:20 - Other students like to think of it in terms
of asking a question, log base a of B, asks,
270:30 - What power do you raise a to in order to get
b? Let's look at some examples. log base two
270:41 - of eight is three, because two to the three
equals eight. In general, log base two of
270:50 - y is asking you the question, What power do
you have to raise to to to get y? So for example,
270:59 - log base two of 16 is four, because it's asking
you the question to what power equals 16?
271:08 - And the answer is four. Please pause the video
and try some of these other examples. log
271:15 - base two of two is asking, What power do you
raise to two to get two? And the answer is
271:22 - one. Two to the one equals two. log base two
of one half is asking two to what power gives
271:34 - you one half? Well, to get one half, you need
to raise two to a negative power. So that
271:40 - would be two to the negative one. So the answer
is negative one. log base two of 1/8 means
271:49 - what power do we raise to two in order to
get 1/8. Since 1/8, is one over two cubed,
271:58 - we have to raise two to the negative three
power to get one over two cubed. So our exponent
272:06 - is negative three. And that's our answer to
our log expression. Finally, log base two
272:13 - of one is asking to what power equals one.
Well, anything raised to the zero power gives
272:21 - us one, so this log expression evaluates to
zero. Notice that we can get positive negative
272:28 - and zero answers for our logarithm expressions.
Please pause the video and figure out what
272:36 - these logs evaluate to. to work out log base
10 of a million. Notice that a million is
272:46 - 10 to the sixth power. Now we're asking the
question, What power do we raise tend to to
272:54 - get a million? So that is what power do we
raise 10 to to get 10 to the six? Well, of
272:59 - course, the answer is going to be six. Similarly,
since point O one is 10 to the minus three,
273:11 - this log expression is the same thing as asking,
what's the log base 10 of 10 to the minus
273:16 - three? Well, what power do you have to raise
10? to to get 10 to the minus three? Of course,
273:22 - the answer is negative three. Log base 10
of zero is asking, What power do we raise
273:31 - 10 to to get zero. If you think about it,
there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent
273:38 - get zero. Raising 10 to a positive exponent
gets us really big positive numbers. Raising
273:43 - 10 to a negative exponent is like one over
10 to a power that's giving us tiny fractions,
273:49 - but they're still positive numbers, we're
never going to get zero. Even if we raise
273:55 - 10 to the zero power, we'll just get one.
So there's no way to get zero and the log
273:59 - base 10 of zero does not exist. If you try
it on your calculator using the log base 10
274:05 - button, you'll get an error message. Same
thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative
274:11 - 100. We're asking 10 to what power equals
negative 100. And there's no exponent that
274:17 - will work. And more generally, it's possible
to take the log of numbers that are greater
274:23 - than zero, but not for numbers that are less
than or equal to zero. In other words, the
274:29 - domain of the function log base a of x, no
matter what base you're using for a, the domain
274:36 - is going to be all positive numbers. A few
notes on notation. When you see ln of x, that's
274:44 - called natural log, and it means the log base
e of x where he is that famous number that's
274:50 - about 2.718. When you see log of x with no
base at all, by convention, that means log
274:59 - base 10 of x And it's called the common log.
Most scientific calculators have buttons for
275:05 - natural log, and for common log. Let's practice
rewriting expressions with logs in them. log
275:13 - base three of one nine is negative two, can
be rewritten as the expression three to the
275:20 - negative two equals 1/9.
275:26 - Log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of
13. So that can be rewritten as 10 to the
275:34 - 1.11394 equals 13. Finally, in this last expression,
ln means natural log, or log base e, so I
275:45 - can rewrite this equation as log base e of
whenever E equals negative one. Well, that
275:52 - means the same thing as e to the negative
one equals one over e, which is true. Now
276:00 - let's go the opposite direction. We'll start
with exponential equations and rewrite them
276:05 - as logs. Remember that log base a of B equals
c means the same thing as a to the C equals
276:14 - b, the base stays the same in both expressions.
So for this example, the base of three in
276:23 - the exponential equation, that's going to
be the same as the base in our log. Now I
276:29 - just have to figure out what's in the argument
of the log. And what goes on the other side
276:33 - of the equal sign. Remember that the answer
to a log is an exponent. So the thing that
276:40 - goes in this box should be my exponent for
my exponential equation. In other words, you.
276:48 - And I'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my
log. This works, because log base three of
276:57 - 9.78 equals view means the same thing as three
to the U equals 9.78, which is just what we
277:06 - started with. In the second example, the base
of my exponential equation is E. So the base
277:13 - of my log is going to be the answer to my
log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent
277:22 - 3x plus seven. And the other expression, the
four minus y becomes my argument of my log.
277:32 - Let me check, log base e of four minus y equals
3x plus seven means e to the 3x plus seven
277:41 - equals four minus y, which is just what I
started with. I can also rewrite log base
277:47 - e as natural log. This video introduced the
idea of logs, and the fact that log base a
277:56 - of B equal c means the same thing as a to
the C equals b. So log base a of B is asking
278:07 - you the question, What power exponent Do you
raise a to in order to get b. In this video,
278:16 - we'll work out the graph, so some log functions
and also talk about their domains. For this
278:22 - first example, let's graph a log function
by hand by plotting some points. The function
278:29 - we're working with is y equals log base two
of x, I'll make a chart of x and y values.
278:36 - Since we're working this out by hand, I want
to pick x values for which it's easy to compute
278:41 - log base two of x. So I'll start out with
the x value of one because log base two of
278:47 - one is zero, log base anything of one is 02
is another x value that's easy to compute
278:56 - log base two of two, that's asking, What power
do I raise to two to get to one? And the answer
279:03 - is one. Power other powers of two are easy
to work with. So for example, log base two
279:11 - of four that saying what power do I raise
to two to get four, so the answer is two.
279:18 - Similarly, log base two of eight is three
and log base two of 16 is four. Let me also
279:26 - work with some fractional values for X. If
x is one half, then log base two of one half
279:33 - that saying what power do I raise to two to
get one half? Well, that needs a power of
279:39 - negative one. It's also easy to compute by
hand, the log base two of 1/4 and 1/8. log
279:48 - base two of 1/4 is negative two since two
to the negative two is 1/4. And similarly,
279:57 - log base two of one eight is negative f3 I'll
put some tick marks on my x and y axes. Please
280:04 - pause the video and take a moment to plot
these points. Let's see, I have the point,
280:10 - one zero, that's here to one that's here,
for two,
280:17 - that is here, and then eight, three, which
is here. And the fractional x values, one
280:26 - half goes with negative one, and 1/4 with
negative two 1/8 with negative three. And
280:33 - if I connect the dots, I get a graph that
looks something like this. If I had smaller
280:39 - and smaller fractions, I would keep getting
more and more negative answers when I took
280:44 - log base two of them, so my graph is getting
more and more negative, my y values are getting
280:51 - more and more negative, as x is getting close
to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the
280:56 - graph over here with negative X values, I
didn't put any negative X values in my chart,
281:02 - that omission is no accident. Because if you
try to take the log base two or base anything
281:08 - of a negative number, like say negative four
or something, there's no answer. This doesn't
281:15 - exist because there's no power that you can
raise to to to get a negative number. So there
281:24 - are no points on the graph for negative X
values. And similarly, there are no points
281:29 - on the graph where x is zero, because you
can't take log base two of zero, there's no
281:35 - power you can raise to two to get zero. I
want to observe some key features of this
281:42 - graph. First of all, the domain is x values
greater than zero. In interval notation, I
281:51 - can write that as a round bracket because
I don't want to include zero to infinity,
281:58 - the range is going to be the y values, while
they go all the way down into the far reaches
282:05 - of the negative numbers. And the graph gradually
increases y value is getting bigger and bigger.
282:11 - So the range is actually all real numbers
are an interval notation negative infinity
282:17 - to infinity. Finally, I want to point out
that this graph has a vertical asymptote at
282:25 - the y axis, that is at the line x equals zero.
I'll draw that on my graph with a dotted line.
282:35 - A vertical asymptote is a line that our functions
graph gets closer and closer to. So this is
282:42 - the graph of y equals log base two of x. But
if I wanted to graph say, y equals log base
282:50 - 10 of x, it would look very similar, it would
still have a domain of X values greater than
282:57 - zero, a range of all real numbers and a vertical
asymptote at the y axis, it will still go
283:02 - through the point one zero, but it would go
through the point 10 one instead, because
283:10 - log base 10 of 10 is one, it would look pretty
much the same, just a lot flatter over here.
283:20 - But even though it doesn't look like it with
the way I've drawn it, it's still gradually
283:24 - goes up to n towards infinity. In fact, the
graph of y equals log base neaa of X for a
283:34 - bigger than one looks pretty much the same,
and has the same three properties. Now that
283:42 - we know what the basic log graph looks like,
we can plot at least rough graphs of other
283:46 - log functions without plotting points. Here
we have the graph of natural log of X plus
283:52 - five. And again, I'm just going to draw a
rough graph. If I did want to do a more accurate
283:57 - graph, I probably would want to plot some
points. But I know that roughly a log graph,
284:02 - if it was just like y equals ln of x, that
would look something like this, and it would
284:09 - go through the point one zero, with a vertical
asymptote along the y axis. Now if I want
284:17 - a graph, ln of x plus five, that just shifts
our graph by five units, it'll still have
284:23 - the same vertical asymptote. Since the vertical
line shifted up by five units, there's still
284:27 - a vertical line, but instead of going through
one zero, it'll go through the point one,
284:33 - five. So I'll draw a rough sketch here. Let's
compare our starting function y equals ln
284:42 - x and the transformed version y equals ln
x plus five in terms of the domain, the range
284:51 - and the vertical asymptote. Our original function
y equals ln x had a domain of zero to infinity
284:59 - Since adding five on the outside affects the
y values, and the domain is the x values,
285:08 - this transformation doesn't change the domain.
So the domain is still from zero to infinity.
285:16 - Now the range of our original y equals ln
x was from negative infinity to infinity.
285:22 - Shifting up by five does affect the y values,
and the range is talking about the y values.
285:28 - But since the original range was all real
numbers, if you add five to all set of all
285:33 - real numbers, you still get the set of all
real numbers. So in this case, the range doesn't
285:38 - change either. And finally, we already saw
that the original vertical asymptote of the
285:43 - y axis x equals zero, when we shift that up
by five units, it's still the vertical line
285:49 - x equals zero. In this next example, we're
starting with a log base 10 function. And
285:57 - since the plus two is on the inside, that
means we shift that graph left by two. So
286:02 - I'll draw our basic log function. Here's our
basic log function. So I'll think of that
286:09 - as y equals log of x going through the point
one, zero,
286:15 - here's its vertical asymptote. Now I need
to shift everything left by two. So my vertical
286:23 - asymptote shifts left, and now it's at the
line x equals negative two, instead of at
286:28 - x equals zero, and my graph, let's see my
point, one zero gets shifted to, let's see
286:37 - negative one zero, since I'm subtracting two
from the axis, and here's a rough sketch of
286:45 - the resulting graph. Let's compare the features
of the two graphs drawn here. We're talking
286:54 - about domains, the original had a domain of
from zero to infinity. But now I've shifted
287:01 - that left. So I've subtracted two from all
my x values. And here's my new domain, which
287:07 - I can also verify just by looking at the picture.
My range was originally from negative infinity
287:15 - to infinity, well, shifting left only affects
the x value. So it doesn't even affect the
287:20 - range. So my range is still negative infinity
to infinity. My vertical asymptote was originally
287:26 - at x equals zero. And since I subtract two
from all x values, that shifts it to x equals
287:32 - negative two. In this last problem, I'm not
going to worry about drawing this graph. I'll
287:38 - just use algebra to compute its domain. So
let's think about what's the issue, when you're
287:44 - taking the logs of things? Well, you can't
take the log of a negative number is zero.
287:50 - So whatever's inside the argument of the log
function, whatever is being fed into log had
287:56 - better be greater than zero. So I'll write
that down, we need to minus 3x to be greater
288:03 - than zero. Now it's a matter of solving an
inequality to it's got to be greater than
288:08 - 3x. So two thirds is greater than x. In other
words, x has to be less than two thirds. So
288:15 - our domain is all the x values from negative
infinity to two thirds, not including two
288:23 - thirds. It's a good idea to memorize the basic
shape of the graph of a log function. It looks
288:31 - something like this, go through the point
one zero, and has a vertical asymptote on
288:36 - the y axis. Also, if you remember that you
can't take the log of a negative number, or
288:44 - zero, then that helps you quickly compute
domains for log functions. Whatever's inside
288:52 - the log function, you set that greater than
zero, and solve. This video is about combining
289:01 - logs and exponents. Please pause the video
and take a moment to use your calculator to
289:07 - evaluate the following four expressions. Remember,
that log base 10 on your calculator is the
289:15 - log button. While log base e on your calculator
is the natural log button, you should find
289:24 - that the log base 10 of 10 cubed is three.
The log base e of e to the 4.2 is 4.2 10 to
289:34 - the log base 10 of 1000 is 1000. And eat the
log base e of 9.6 is 9.6. In each case, the
289:45 - log and the exponential function with the
same base undo each other and we're left with
289:51 - the exponent. In fact, it's true that for
any base a the log base a of a to the x is
289:59 - equal to x, the same sort of cancellation
happens if we do the exponential function
290:05 - in the log function with the same base in
the opposite order. For example, we take 10
290:10 - to the power of log base 10 of 1000, the 10
to the power and the log base 10 undo each
290:15 - other, and we're left with the 1000s. This
happens for any base, say, a data log base
290:21 - a of x is equal to x. We can describe this
by saying that an exponential function and
290:31 - a log function with the same base undo each
other. If you're familiar with the language
290:40 - of inverse functions, the exponential function
and log function are inverses. Let's see why
290:46 - these roles hold for the first log role. log
base a of a dx is asking the question, What
290:55 - power do we raise a two in order to get a
to the x? In other words, a two what power
291:03 - is a dx? Well, the answer is clearly x. And
that's why log base a of a to the x equals
291:11 - x. For the second log rule,
291:15 - notice that the log base a of x means the
power we raise a two to get x. But this expression
291:25 - is saying that we're supposed to raise a to
that power. If we raise a to the power, we
291:30 - need to raise a two to get x, then we'll certainly
get x. Now let's use these two rules. In some
291:37 - examples. If we want to find three to the
log base three of 1.43 to the power and log
291:44 - base three undo each other, so we're left
with 1.4. If we want to find ln of e iliacs.
291:51 - Remember that ln means log base e. So we're
taking log base e of e to the x, well, those
291:59 - functions undo each other, and we're left
with x. If we want to take 10 to the log of
292:05 - three z, remember that log without a base
written implies that the base is 10. So really,
292:12 - we want to take 10 to the log base 10 of three
z will tend to a power and log base 10 undo
292:18 - each other. So we're left with a three z.
Finally, this last statement hold is ln of
292:26 - 10 to the x equal to x, well, ln means log
base e. So we're taking log base e of 10 to
292:36 - the x, notice that the base of the log and
the base of the exponential function are not
292:41 - the same. So they don't undo each other. And
in fact, log base e of 10 to the x is not
292:47 - usually equal to x, we can check with one
example. Say if x equals one, then log base
292:53 - e of 10 to the one, that's log base e of 10.
And we can check on the calculator that's
292:59 - equal to 2.3. And some more decimals, which
is not the same thing as one. So this statement
293:06 - is false, it does not hold. We need the basis
to be the same for logs and exponents to undo
293:13 - each other. In this video, we saw that logs
and exponents with the same base undo each
293:23 - other. Specifically,
293:26 - log base a of a to the x is equal to x and
a to the log base a of x is also equal to
293:33 - x
293:34 - for any values of x and any base a. This video
is about rules or properties of logs. The
293:42 - log rules are closely related to the exponent
rules. So let's start by reviewing some of
293:46 - the exponent rules. To keep things simple,
we'll write everything down with a base of
293:51 - two. Even though the exponent rules hold for
any base. We know that if we raise two to
293:57 - the zero power, we get one, we have a product
rule for exponents, which says that two to
294:04 - the M times two to the n is equal to two to
the m plus n. In other words, if we multiply
294:12 - two numbers, then we add the exponents. We
also have a quotient rule that says that two
294:18 - to the M divided by n to the n is equal to
two to the m minus n. In words, that says
294:26 - that if we divide two numbers, then we subtract
the exponents. Finally, we have a power rule
294:34 - that says if we take a power to a power, then
we multiply the exponents. Each of these exponent
294:43 - rules can be rewritten as a log rule. The
first rule, two to the zero equals one can
294:50 - be rewritten in terms of logs as log base
two of one equals zero. That's because log
294:57 - base two of one equals zero mean To the zero
equals one. The second rule, the product rule
295:05 - can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying
log of x times y equals log of x plus log
295:14 - of y. I'll make these base two to agree with
my base that I'm using for my exponent rules.
295:21 - In words, that says the log of the product
is the sum of the logs. Since logs really
295:28 - represent exponent, this is saying that when
you multiply two numbers together, you add
295:34 - their exponents, which is just what we said
for the exponent version. The quotient rule
295:41 - for exponents can be rewritten in terms of
logs by saying the log of x divided by y is
295:48 - equal to the log of x minus the log of y.
In words, we can say that the log of the quotient
295:58 - is equal to the difference of the logs. Since
logs are really exponents, another way of
296:04 - saying the same thing is that when you divide
two numbers, you subtract their exponents.
296:11 - That's how we described the exponent rule
above. Finally, the power rule for exponents
296:18 - can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying
the log of x to the n is equal to n times
296:27 - log of x. Sometimes people describe this rule
by saying when you take the log of an expression
296:34 - with an exponent, you can bring down the exponent
and multiply. If we think of x as being some
296:40 - power of two, this is really saying when we
take a power to a power, we multiply their
296:45 - exponents. That's exactly how we described
the power rule above. It doesn't really matter
296:50 - if you multiply this exponent on the left
side, or on the right side. But it's more
296:56 - traditional to multiply it on the left side.
I've given these rules with the base of two,
297:03 - but they actually work for any base. To help
you remember them, please take a moment to
297:07 - write out the log roles using a base of a
you should get the following chart. Let's
297:17 - use the log rules to rewrite the following
expressions as a sum or difference of logs.
297:23 - In the first expression, we have a log base
10 of a quotient. So we can rewrite the log
297:30 - of the quotient as the difference of the logs.
Now we still have the log of a product, I
297:39 - can rewrite the log of a product as the sum
of the logs. So that is log of y plus log
297:47 - of z. When I put things together, I have to
be careful because here I'm subtracting the
297:55 - entire log expression. So I need to subtract
both terms of this song on the make sure I
298:02 - do that by putting them in parentheses. Now
I can simplify a little bit by distributing
298:08 - the negative sign. And here's my final answer.
In my next expression, I have the log of a
298:16 - product. So I can rewrite that as the sum
of two logs.
298:21 - I can also use my power rule to bring down
the exponent T and multiply it in the front.
298:31 - That gives me the final expression log of
five plus t times log of to one common mistake
298:38 - on this problem is to rewrite this expression
as t times log of five times two. In fact,
298:47 - those two expressions are not equal. Because
the T only applies to the two, not to the
298:54 - whole five times two, we can't just bring
it down in front using the power wall. After
298:59 - all, the power rule only applies to a single
expression raised to an exponent, and not
299:08 - to a product like this. And these next examples,
we're going to go the other direction. Here
299:14 - we're given sums and differences of logs.
And we want to wrap them up into a single
299:18 - log expression. By look at the first two pieces,
that's a difference of logs. So I know I can
299:24 - rewrite it as the log of a quotient. Now I
have the sum of two logs. So I can rewrite
299:34 - that as the log of a product. I'll clean that
up a little bit and rewrite it as log base
299:43 - five of a times c over B. In my second example,
I can rewrite the sum of my logs as the log
299:54 - of a product now, I will Like to rewrite this
difference of logs as the log of a quotient.
300:03 - But I can't do it yet, because of that factor
of two multiplied in front. But I can use
300:09 - the power rule backwards to put that two back
up in the exponent. So I'll do that first.
300:15 - So I will copy down the ln of x plus one times
x minus one, and rewrite this second term
300:23 - as ln of x squared minus one squared. Now
I have a straightforward difference of two
300:31 - logs, which I can rewrite as the log of a
quotient. I can actually simplify this some
300:40 - more. Since x plus one times x minus one is
the same thing as x squared minus one. I can
300:50 - cancel factors to get ln of one over x squared
minus one. In this video, we saw four rules
301:00 - for logs that are related to exponent rules.
First, we saw that the log with any base of
301:07 - one is equal to zero. Second, we saw the product
rule, the log of a product is equal to the
301:15 - sum of the logs. We saw the quotient rule,
the log of a quotient is the difference of
301:23 - the logs. And we saw the power rule. When
you take a log of an expression with an exponent
301:30 - in it, you can bring down the exponent and
multiply it. It's worth noticing that there's
301:37 - no log rule that helps you split up the log
of a psalm. In particular, the log of a psalm
301:44 - is not equal to the sum of the logs. If you
think about logs and exponent rules going
301:52 - together, this kind of makes sense, because
there's also no rule for rewriting the sum
302:00 - of two exponential expressions.
302:04 - Log rules will be super handy, as we start
to solve equations using logs. Anytime you
302:10 - have an equation like this one that has variables
in the exponent logs are the tool of choice
302:17 - for getting those variables down where you
can solve for them. In this video, I'll do
302:23 - a few examples of solving equations with variables
in the exponent. For our first example, let's
302:29 - solve for x the equation five times two to
the x plus one equals 17. As my first step,
302:37 - I'm going to isolate the difficult spot, the
part that has the variables and the exponent.
302:42 - In this example, I can do that by dividing
both sides by five. That gives me two to the
302:47 - x plus one equals 17 over five. Next, I'm
going to take the log of both sides, it's
302:56 - possible to take the log with any base, but
I prefer to take the log base 10, or the log
303:00 - base e for the simple reason that my calculator
has buttons for those logs. So in this example,
303:06 - I'll just take the log base 10. So I can omit
the base because it's a base 10 is implied
303:12 - here. And that gives me this expression. As
my next step, I'm going to use log roles to
303:19 - bring down my exponent and multiply it on
the front. It's important to use parentheses
303:24 - here because the entire x plus one needs to
get multiplied by log two. So that was my
303:31 - third step using the log roles. Now all my
variables are down from the exponent where
303:37 - I can work with them, but I still need to
solve for x. Right now x is trapped in the
303:42 - parentheses. So I'm going to free it from
the parentheses by distributing. So I get
303:47 - x log two plus log two equals log of 17 fifths.
Now I will try to isolate x by moving all
303:55 - my terms with x's in them to one side, and
all my terms without x's in them to the other
304:01 - side. Finally, I factor out my x. Well, it's
already kind of factored out, and I divide
304:08 - to isolate it. So I read out what I did. So
far I distributed. I moved all the x terms
304:17 - on one side, and the terms without x's on
the other side. And then I isolated the x
304:24 - by factoring out and dividing. We have an
exact solution for x. This is correct, but
304:31 - maybe not so useful if you want a decimal
answer. At this point, you can type in everything
304:36 - into your calculator using parentheses liberally
to get a decimal answer about 0.765. It's
304:46 - always a good idea to check your work by typing
in this decimal answer and seeing if the equation
304:51 - checks out. This next example is trickier
because there are variables in the exponent
304:57 - in two places with two different bases. First
step is normally to clean things up and simplify
305:05 - by isolating the tricky stuff. But in this
example, there's nothing really to clean up
305:10 - or simplifier, or no way to isolate anything
more than it already is. So we'll go ahead
305:15 - to the next step and take the log of both
sides. Again, I'll go ahead and use log base
305:20 - 10. But we couldn't use log base e instead.
Next, we can use log roles to bring down the
305:27 - exponents. This gives me 2x minus three in
parentheses, log two equals x minus two, log
305:35 - five. Now I'm going to distribute things out
to free the excess from the parentheses. That
305:43 - gives me 2x log two minus three log two equals
x log five minus two log five. Now I need
305:52 - to group the x terms on one side, and the
other terms that don't involve x on the other
305:59 - side. So I'll keep the 2x log two on the left,
put the minus log x log five on the left,
306:08 - and that gives me the minus two log five that
stays on the right and a plus three log two
306:13 - on the right. Finally, I need to isolate x
by factoring and dividing by factoring I just
306:22 - mean I factor out the x from all the terms
on the left, so that gives me x times the
306:27 - quantity to log two minus log five. And that
equals this mess on the right. Now I can divide
306:37 - the right side by the quantity on the left
side. When you type this into your calculator,
306:48 - I encourage you to type the whole thing in
rather than type bits and pieces in because
306:53 - if you round off, you'll get a less accurate
answer than if you type the whole thing in
306:58 - at once. In this example, when I type it in,
I get a final answer of about 5.106.
307:06 - In this equation, we have the variable t in
the exponent in two places. The letter E is
307:12 - not a variable, it represents the number e
whose decimal approximation is about 2.7.
307:19 - Because there's already an E and the expression,
it's going to be handy to use natural log
307:24 - in this problem instead of log base 10. But
before we take the log of both sides, let's
307:29 - clean things up. by isolating the tricky parts,
we could at least divide both sides by five.
307:35 - And that will give us either the negative
0.05 t is equal to three fifths it is 0.2
307:42 - T. One way to proceed would now be to clean
things out further by dividing both sides
307:47 - by either the point two t, but I'm going to
take a different approach and go ahead and
307:51 - take the natural log of both sides. That gives
me ln of e to the minus 0.05 t is equal to
308:01 - ln of three fifths e to the 0.2 t. Now on
the left side, I can immediately use my log
308:08 - rule to bring down my exponent and get minus
0.05 t, L and E. But on the right side, I
308:18 - can't bring down the exponent yet because
this e to the point two t is multiplied by
308:23 - three fifths. So before I can bring down the
exponent, I need to split up this product
308:28 - using the product rule. So I can rewrite this
as ln of three fifths plus ln e to the 0.2
308:36 - T. And now I can bring down the exponent.
So that third step was using log roles to
308:47 - ultimately bring down my exponents. Now ln
of E is a really nice expression, ln IV means
308:56 - log base e of E. So that's asking what power
do I raise E to in order to get e? And the
309:02 - answer is one. So anytime I have ln of E,
I can just replace that with one. That's why
309:10 - using natural log is a little bit handier
here than using log base 10. You can make
309:14 - that simplification. Next, I'm ready to solve
for t. So I don't need to distribute here.
309:23 - But I do need to bring my T terms to one side
of my terms without t to the other side. So
309:29 - let's see. I'll put my T terms on the left
and my team turns without T on the right.
309:37 - And finally I'm going to isolate t by factoring
and dividing. So by factoring I mean I factor
309:45 - out my T 
and now I can divide. Using my calculator,
309:57 - I can get a decimal answer of 2.04 Three,
three. This video gave some examples of solving
310:04 - equations with variables in the exponent.
And the key idea was to take the log of both
310:10 - sides and use the log properties to bring
the exponents down. This video, give some
310:21 - examples of equations with logs in them like
this one. In order to solve the equations
310:26 - like this one, we have to free the variable
from the log. And we'll do that using exponential
310:32 - functions. My first step in solving pretty
much any kind of equation is to simplify it
310:38 - and isolate the tricky part. In this case,
the tricky part is the part with the log in
310:44 - it. So I can isolate it by first adding three
to both sides. That gives me two ln 2x plus
310:51 - five equals four, and then I can divide both
sides by two. Now that I've isolated the tricky
311:01 - part, I still need to solve for x, but x is
trapped inside the log function. to free it,
311:07 - I need to somehow undo the log function. Well
log functions and exponential functions undo
311:13 - each other. And since this is a log base e,
I need to use the exponential function base
311:18 - e also. So I'm going to take e to the power
of both sides. In other words, I'll take e
311:26 - to the ln 2x plus five, and that's going to
equal e to the power of two.
311:33 - Now e to the ln of anything, I'll just write
a for anything. That means e to the log base
311:40 - e of a, that you the power and log base e
undo each other. So we just get a, I'm going
311:46 - to use that principle over here, e to the
ln of 2x plus five, the E and the log base
311:53 - e undo each other. And we're left with 2x
plus five on the left side. So 2x plus five
311:59 - is equal to E squared. And from there, it's
easy to finish the problem and solve for x
312:04 - by subtracting five from both sides and then
dividing by two. So I'll just write the third
312:11 - step here is to just say finish solving for
x. There's one last step we need to do when
312:17 - solving equations with logs in them. And that's
to check our answers. Because we may get extraneous
312:25 - solutions. an extraneous solution is a solution
that comes out of the solving process, but
312:31 - doesn't actually satisfy the original equation.
And those can happen for equations with logs
312:36 - in them, because we might get a solution that
makes the argument of the log negative or
312:42 - zero, and we can't take the log of a negative
numbers zero. So let's check and plug in the
312:52 - solution of E squared minus five over two.
We'll plug that in for x in our original equation
313:01 - and see if that works. So let's see the twos
cancel here. So I get two ln e squared minus
313:09 - five plus five, minus three, I want that to
equal one. And now my fives cancel. And so
313:17 - I have two ln e squared minus three that I
want to equal one. Well, I think this is going
313:23 - to work out because let's see, ln is log base
e. and log base e of E squared that's asking
313:34 - the question, What power do I raise e two
to get e squared? Well, I have to raise it
313:38 - to the power of two to get e squared. So this
becomes two times two minus three. And does
313:46 - that equal one, four minus three does equal
one. So that all checks out. And we didn't
313:53 - have any problem with taking the log of negative
numbers zero, we didn't get any extraneous
313:58 - solutions. So this is our solution. The second
equation is a little bit trickier, because
314:04 - there's a log into places. Now notice that
this is a log where there's no base written.
314:10 - So a base 10 is implied. So I'm already thinking
in order to undo a log base 10, I'm going
314:16 - to want to take a 10 to the power of both
sides. Of course, it's still a good idea to
314:23 - isolate the tricky part, but there's nothing
really to isolate here. So I'm going to say,
314:29 - can't do it here. So we'll just jump right
to straight step two, and take 10 to the power
314:37 - of both sides. Okay, so that's going to give
me 10 to the whole thing, log x plus three
314:46 - plus log x, that whole thing is in the exponent
equals 10 to the One Power. Well, I know what
314:52 - to do with the right side 10 to the one is
just 10. But what do I do with the 10 to these
314:58 - two things added
314:59 - up Up,
315:00 - while remembering my exponent rules, I know
that when you add up the exponent, that's
315:06 - what happens when you multiply two things.
So this is the same thing as 10 to the log
315:12 - x plus three times 10 to the log x, right,
because when you multiply two things, you
315:18 - add the exponent, so these are the same. Okay,
now we're in business, because 10 to the log
315:24 - base 10, those undo each other. And so this
whole expression here simplifies to x plus
315:31 - three. Similarly, 10 to the log base, 10 of
x is just x. So I'm multiplying x plus three
315:38 - by x, that's equal to 10. Now I have an equation
I can deal with, it's a quadratic, so I'm
315:46 - going to first multiply out to make it look
more like a quadratic, get everything to one
315:52 - side. So is equal to zero. And, and now I
can either factor or use the quadratic formula.
315:59 - I think this one factors, it looks like X
plus five times x minus two, so I'm going
316:06 - to get x is negative five, or x is two. So
that was all the third step to finish solving
316:14 - for x. Finally, we need to check our solutions
to make sure we haven't gotten some extraneous
316:20 - ones. So let's see if x equals negative five.
If I plug that into my original equation,
316:27 - that says, I'm checking that log of negative
five plus three, plus log of negative five,
316:36 - checking that's equal to one. Well, this is
giving me a queasy feeling. And I hope it's
316:40 - giving you a queasy feeling too, because log
of negative two does not exist, right, you
316:48 - can't take the log of a negative number. Same
thing with log of negative five. So x equals
316:53 - negative five is an extraneous solution, it
doesn't actually solve our original equation.
317:00 - Let's check the other solution, x equals two.
So now we're checking to see if log of two
317:08 - plus three plus log of two is equal to one.
Since there's no problem with taking logs
317:15 - of negative numbers, or zero here, this should
work out fine. And just to finish checking,
317:20 - we can see let's see this is log of five plus
log of two, we want that equal one. But using
317:27 - my log rules, the sum of two logs is the log
of the product. So log of five times two,
317:34 - we want that to equal one. And that's just
log base 10 of 10. And that definitely equals
317:41 - one because log base 10 of 10 says, What power
do I raise tend to to get 10. And that power
317:46 - is one. So the second solution x equals two
does check out. And that's our final answer.
317:56 - Before I leave this problem, I do want to
mention that some people have an alternative
318:00 - approach. Some people like to start with the
original equation, and then use log roles
318:05 - to combine everything into one log expression.
So since we have the sum of two logs, we know
318:12 - that's the same as the log of a product, right,
so we can rewrite the left side as log of
318:18 - x plus three times x, that equals one, then
we do the same trick of taking 10 to the power
318:25 - of both sides. And as before, the 10 to the
power and the log base 10 undo each other,
318:32 - and we get x plus three times x equals 10,
just like we did before. In the first solution,
318:40 - we ended up using exponent rules to rewrite
things. In the second alternative method,
318:45 - we use log rules to rewrite things. So the
methods are really pretty similar, pretty
318:50 - equivalent, and they certainly will get us
to the same answer. So we've seen a couple
318:54 - examples of equations with logs in them and
how to solve them. And the key step is to
319:02 - use exponential functions to undo the log.
In other words, take e to the power of both
319:13 - sides to undo natural log, and take 10 to
the power of both sides. To undo log base
319:25 - 10.
319:27 - In this video, we'll use exponential equations
in some real life applications, like population
319:33 - growth and radioactive decay. I'll also introduce
the ideas of half life and doubling time.
319:40 - In this first example, let's suppose we invest
$1,600 in a bank account that earns 6.5% annual
319:47 - interest compounded once a year. How many
years will it take until the account has $2,000
319:52 - in it if you don't make any further deposits
or withdrawals since our money is earning
319:59 - six point 5% interest each year, that means
that every year the money gets multiplied
320:05 - by 1.065. So after t years, my 1600 gets multiplied
by 1.065 to the t power. I'll write this in
320:18 - function notation as f of t equals 1600 times
1.065 to the T, where f of t is the amount
320:30 - of money after t years. Now we're trying to
figure out how long it will take to get $2,000
320:41 - $2,000 is a amount of money. So that's an
amount for f of t. And we're trying to solve
320:48 - for T the amount of time. So let me write
out my equation and make a note that I'm solving
320:55 - for t. Now to solve for t, I want to first
isolate the tricky part. So I'm going to the
321:04 - tricky part is the part with the exponential
in it. So I'm going to divide both sides by
321:08 - 1600. That gives me 2000 over 1600 equals
1.065. To the tee, I can simplify this a little
321:18 - bit further as five fourths. Now that I've
isolated the tricky part, my next step is
321:24 - going to be to take the log of both sides.
That's because I have a variable in the exponent.
321:29 - And I know that if I log take the log of both
sides, I can use log roles to bring that exponent
321:33 - down where I can solve for it. I think I'll
use log base e this time. So I have ln fi
321:40 - force equals ln of 1.065 to the T. Now by
the power rule for logs, on the right side,
321:48 - I can bring that exponent t down and multiply
it in the front. Now it's easy to isolate
321:56 - t just by dividing both sides by ln of 1.065.
Typing that into my calculator, I get that
322:07 - t is approximately 3.54 years. And the next
example, we have a population of bacteria
322:17 - that initially contains 1.5 million bacteria,
and it's growing by 12% per day, we want to
322:24 - find the doubling time, the doubling time
means the amount of time it takes for a quantity
322:34 - to double in size. For example, the amount
of time it takes to get from the initial 1.5
322:41 - million bacteria to 3 million bacteria would
be the doubling time. Let's start by writing
322:47 - an equation for the amount of bacteria. So
if say, P of t represents the number of bacteria
322:56 - in millions, then my equation and T represents
time in days, then P of t is going to be given
323:08 - by the initial amount of bacteria times the
growth factor 1.12 to the T. That's because
323:19 - my population of bacteria is growing by 12%
per day. That means the number of bacteria
323:25 - gets multiplied by one point 12. Since we're
looking for the doubling time, we're looking
323:30 - for the t value when P of D will be twice
as big. So I can set P of t to be three and
323:39 - solve for t. As before, I'll start by isolating
the tricky part, taking the log 
323:56 - bringing the T down. And finally solving for
T. Let's see three over 1.5 is two so I can
324:08 - write this as ln two over ln 1.12. Using my
calculator, that's about 6.12 days. It's an
324:19 - interesting fact that doubling time only depends
on the growth rate, that 12% growth, not the
324:32 - initial population. In fact, I could have
figured out the doubling time without even
324:37 - knowing how many bacteria were in my initial
population. Let me show you how that would
324:41 - work. If I didn't know how many I started
with, I could still write P of t equals a
324:48 - times 1.12 to the t where a is our initial
population that I don't know what it is.
324:55 - Then if I want to figure out how long it takes
for my population, to double Well, if I start
325:01 - with a and double that I get to a. So I'll
set my population equal to two a. And I'll
325:08 - solve for t. Notice that my A's cancel. And
so when I take the log of both sides and bring
325:19 - the T down and solve for t, I get the exact
same thing as before, it didn't matter what
325:32 - the initial population was, I didn't even
have to know what it was. In this next example,
325:38 - we're told the initial population, and we're
told the doubling time, we're not told by
325:42 - what percent the population increases each
minute, or by what number, we're forced to
325:49 - multiply the population by each minute. So
we're gonna have to solve for that, I do know
325:53 - that I want to use an equation of the form
y equals a times b to the T, where T is going
325:59 - to be the number of minutes, and y is going
to be the number of bacteria. And I know that
326:04 - my initial amount a is 350. So I can really
write y equals 350 times b to the T. Now the
326:11 - doubling time tells me that when 15 minutes
have elapsed, my population is going to be
326:19 - twice as big, or 700. plugging that into my
equation, I have 700 equals 350 times b to
326:28 - the 15. Now I need to solve for b. Let me
clean this up a little bit by dividing both
326:34 - sides by 350. That gives me 700 over 350 equals
b to the 15th. In other words, two equals
326:43 - b to the 15th. To solve for B, I don't have
to actually use logs here, because my variables
326:51 - in the base not in the exponent, so I don't
need to bring that exponent down. Instead,
326:57 - the easiest way to solve this is just by taking
the 15th root of both sides or equivalently.
327:03 - The 1/15 power. That's because if I take B
to the 15th to the 1/15, I multiply by exponents,
327:12 - that gives me B to the one is equal to two
to the 1/15. In other words, B is two to the
327:19 - 1/15, which as a decimal is approximately
1.047294. I like to use a lot of decimals
327:29 - if I'm doing a decimal approximation and these
kind of problems to increase accuracy. But
327:34 - of course, the most accurate thing is just
to leave B as it is. And I'll do that and
327:38 - rewrite my equation is y equals 350 times
two to the 1/15 to the T. Now I'd like to
327:50 - work this problem one more time. And this
time, I'm going to use the form of the equation
327:56 - y equals a times e to the RT. This is called
a continuous growth model. It looks different,
328:04 - but it's actually an equivalent form to this
growth model over here. And I'll say more
328:09 - about why these two forms are equivalent at
the end, I can use the same general ideas
328:14 - to solve in this form. So I know that my initial
amount is 350. And I know again that when
328:21 - t is 15, my Y is 700. So I plug in 700 here
350 e to the r times 15. And I solve for r.
328:33 - Again, I'm going to simplify things by dividing
both sides by 350. That gives me two equals
328:44 - e to the r times 15. This time my variable
does end up being in the exponent. So I do
328:51 - want to take the log of both sides, I'm going
to use natural log, because I already have
328:56 - an E and my problem. So natural log and E
are kind of more harmonious the other than
329:01 - then common log with base 10 and E. So I take
the log of both sides. Now I can pull the
329:09 - exponent down. So that's our times 15 times
ln of E. Well Elena V is just one, right?
329:14 - Because Elena V is asking what power do I
raise E to to get e that's just one. And so
329:19 - I get 15 r equals ln two. So r is equal to
ln two divided by 15. Let me plug that back
329:27 - in to my original equation as e to the ln
two over 15 times t. Now I claimed that these
329:35 - two equations were actually the same thing
just looking different. And the way to see
329:40 - that is if I start with this equation, and
I rewrite as e to the ln two over 15 like
329:49 - that
329:50 - to the tee. Well, I claim that this quantity
right here is the same thing as my two to
329:58 - the 1/15. And in fact One way to see that
is e to the ln two already to the 115. The
330:06 - Right, that's the same, because every time
I take a power to a power, I multiply exponents.
330:10 - But what's Ed Oh, and two, E and ln undo each
other, so that's just 350 times two to the
330:18 - 1/15 to the T TA, the equations are really
the same. And these, you'll always be able
330:24 - to find two different versions of an exponential
equation, sort of the standard one, a times
330:30 - b to the T, or the continuous growth one,
a times e to the RT. In this last example,
330:38 - we're going to work with half life, half life
is pretty much like doubling time, it just
330:43 - means the amount of time that it takes for
a quantity to decrease to half as much as
330:55 - we originally started with, we're told that
the half life of radioactive carbon 14 is
331:02 - 5750 years. So that means it takes that long
for a quantity of radioactive carbon 14 to
331:11 - decay, so that you just have half as much
left and the rest is nonradioactive form.
331:16 - So we're told a sample of bone that originally
contained 200 grams of radioactive carbon
331:21 - 14 now contains only 40 grams, we're supposed
to find out how old the sample is, is called
331:29 - carbon dating. Let's use the continuous growth
model this time. So our final amount, so this
331:36 - is our amount of radioactive c 14 is going
to be the initial amount 
331:49 - times e to the RT, we could have used the
other model to we could have used f of t equals
331:54 - a times b to the T, but I just want to use
the continuous model for practice. So we know
331:59 - that our half life is 5750. So what that means
is when t is 5750, our amount is going to
332:13 - be one half of what we started with. Let me
see if I can plug that into my equation and
332:19 - figure out use that to figure out what r is.
That's ours called the continuous growth rate.
332:26 - So I plug in one half a for the final amount,
a is still the initial amount, e to the r
332:35 - and I have 5750 I can cancel my A's. And now
I want to solve for r, r is in my exponent.
332:46 - So I do need to take the log of both sides
to solve for it. I'm going to use log base
332:50 - e since I already have an E and my problem,
log base e is more compatible with E then
332:57 - log base 10 is okay. Now, on the left side,
I still have log of one half and natural log
333:04 - of one half on the right side, ln n e to a
power those undo each other. So I'm left with
333:09 - R times 5750. Now I can solve for r, it's
ln one half over 5750 could work that as a
333:20 - decimal, but it's actually more accurate just
to keep it in exact form. So now I can rewrite
333:25 - my equation, I have f of t equals a times
e to the ln one half over five 750 t. Now
333:40 - I can use that to figure out my problem. And
my problem the bone originally contained 200
333:46 - grams, that's my a, I want to figure out when
it's going to contain only 40 grams, that's
333:53 - my final amount. And so I need to solve for
t. I'll clean things up by dividing both sides
334:00 - by 200. Let's say 40 over 200 is 1/5. Now
I'm going to take the ln of both sides. And
334:10 - ln and e to the power undo each other. So
I'm left with Elena 1/5 equals ln of one half
334:19 - divided by five 750 T. And finally I can solve
for t but super messy but careful use of my
334:27 - calculator gives me an answer of 13,351 years
approximately.
334:35 - That kind of makes sense in terms of the half
life because to get from 200 to 40 you have
334:41 - to decrease by half a little more than two
times right or increasing by half once would
334:45 - get you to 100 decreasing to half again would
get you to 50 a little more than 40 and two
334:50 - half lives is getting pretty close to 13,000
years. This video introduced a lot of new
334:57 - things it introduced continue Less growth
model, which is another equivalent way of
335:04 - writing an exponential function. The relationship
is that the B in this example, is the same
335:16 - thing as EDR. In that version, it also introduced
the ideas of doubling time. And HalfLife the
335:27 - amount of time it takes a quantity to double
or decreased to half in an exponential growth
335:32 - model. Recall that a linear equation is equation
like for example, 2x minus y equals one. It's
335:42 - an equation without any x squared or y squared
in it, something that could be rewritten in
335:47 - the form y equals mx plus b, the equation
for a line a system of linear equations is
335:55 - a collection of two or more linear equations.
For example, I could have these two equations.
336:03 - A solution to a system of equations is that
an x value and a y value that satisfy both
336:10 - of the equations. For example, the ordered
pair two three, that means x equals two, y
336:18 - equals three is a solution to this system.
Because if I plug in x equals two, and y equals
336:26 - three into the first equation, it checks out
since two times two minus three is equal to
336:33 - one. And if I plug in x equals two and y equals
three into the second equation, it also checks
336:40 - out two plus three equals five. However, the
ordered pair one for that is x equals one,
336:49 - y equals four is not a solution to the system.
Even though this X and Y value work in the
336:55 - second equation, since one plus four does
equal five, it doesn't work in the first equation,
337:02 - because two times one minus four is not equal
to one. In this video, we'll use systematic
337:10 - methods to find the solutions to systems of
linear equations. In this first example, we
337:17 - want to solve this system of equations, there
are two main methods we could use, we could
337:22 - use the method of substitution, or we could
use the method of elimination. If we use the
337:29 - method of substitution, the main idea is to
isolate one variable in one equation, and
337:38 - then substitute it in to the other equation.
For example, we can start with the first equation
337:44 - 3x minus two y equals four, and isolate the
x by adding two y to both sides, and then
337:53 - dividing both sides by three. Think I'll rewrite
that a little bit by breaking up the fraction
338:01 - into two fractions four thirds plus two thirds
y. Now, I'm going to copy down the second
338:07 - equation 5x plus six y equals two. And I'm
going to substitute in my expression for x.
338:16 - That gives me five times four thirds plus
two thirds y plus six y equals two. And now
338:24 - I've got an equation with only one variable
in it y. So I can solve for y as a number.
338:30 - First, I'm going to distribute the five so
that gives me 20 thirds plus 10 thirds y plus
338:38 - six y equals two. And now I'm going to keep
all my y terms, my terms with y's in them
338:45 - on the left side, but I'll move all my terms
without y's in them to the right side. At
338:51 - this point, I could just add up all my fractions
and solve for y. But since I don't really
338:56 - like working with fractions, I think I'll
do the trick of clearing the denominators
339:00 - here. So I'm going to actually multiply both
sides by my common denominator of three just
339:05 - to get rid of the denominators and not have
to work with fractions. So let me write that
339:10 - down. Distributing the three, I get 10 y plus
eight t and y equals six minus 20. Now add
339:20 - things together. So that's 28 y equals negative
14. So that means that y is going to be negative
339:28 - 14 over 28, which is negative one half.
339:32 - So I've solved for y. And now I can go back
and plug y into either of my equations to
339:38 - solve for x, I plug it into my first equation.
So I'm plugging in negative one half for y.
339:47 - That gives me 3x plus one equals four. So
3x equals three, which means that x is equal
339:55 - to one. I've solved my system of equations
and gotten x equals one On y equals minus
340:01 - one half, I can also write that as an ordered
pair, one, negative one half for my solution.
340:09 - Now let's go back and solve the same system,
but use a different method, the method of
340:14 - elimination, the key idea to the method of
elimination is to multiply each equation by
340:23 - a constant to make the coefficients of one
variable match. Let me start by copying down
340:34 - my two equations. Say I'm trying to make the
coefficient of x match. One way to do that
340:42 - is to multiply the first equation by five,
and the second equation by three. That way,
340:48 - the coefficient of x will be 15 for both equations,
so let me do that. So for the first equation,
340:55 - I'm going to multiply both sides by five.
And for the second equation, I'm going to
341:00 - multiply both sides by three. That gives me
for the first equation 15x minus 10, y equals
341:09 - 20. And for the second equation, 15x plus
18, y is equal to six. Notice that the equate
341:19 - the coefficients of x match. So if I subtract
the second equation from the first, the x
341:25 - term will completely go away, it'll be zero
times x, and I'll be left with let's see negative
341:32 - 10 y minus 18, y is going to give me minus
28 y. And if I do 20 minus six, that's going
341:44 - to give me 14. solving for y, I get y is 14
over minus 28, which is minus one half just
341:52 - like before. Now we can continue, like we
did in the previous solution, and substitute
341:59 - that value of y into either one of the equations.
I'll put it again in here. And my solution
342:06 - proceeds as before. So once again, I get the
solution that x equals one and y equals minus
342:13 - one half. Before we go on to the next problem,
let me show you graphically what this means.
342:20 - Here I've graphed the equations 3x minus two,
y equals four, and 5x plus six y equals two.
342:29 - And we can see that these two lines intersect
in the point with coordinates one negative
342:36 - one half, just like we predicted by solving
equations algebraically. Let's take a look
342:42 - at another system of equations. I'm going
to rewrite the first equation, so the x term
342:49 - is on the left side with the y term, and the
constant term stays on the right. And I'll
342:55 - rewrite or copy down the second equation.
Since the coefficient of x in the first equation
343:02 - is minus four, and the second equation is
three, I'm going to try using the method of
343:08 - elimination and multiply the first equation
by three and the second equation by four.
343:14 - That'll give me a coefficient of x of negative
12. And the first equation, and 12. And the
343:19 - second equation, those are equal and opposite,
right, so I'll be able to add together my
343:23 - equations to cancel out access. So let's do
that. My first equation becomes negative 12x
343:31 - plus 24, y equals three, and I'll put everything
by three. And my second equation, I'll multiply
343:39 - everything by four. So that's 12x minus 24,
y equals eight. Now something kind of funny
343:46 - has happened here, not only do the x coefficients
match has in with opposite signs, but the
343:53 - Y coefficients do also. So if I add together
my two equations, in order to cancel out the
344:00 - x term, I'm also going to cancel out the y
term, and I'll just get zero plus zero is
344:06 - equal to three plus eight is 11. Well, that's
a contradiction, we can't have zero equal
344:12 - to 11. And that shows that these two equations
actually have no solution.
344:19 - Let's look at this situation graphically.
If we graph our two equations, we see that
344:25 - they're parallel lines with the same slope.
This might be more clear, if I isolate y in
344:31 - each equation, the first equation, I get y
equals, let's see, dividing by eight that's
344:36 - the same thing as four eighths or one half
x plus one eight. And the second equation,
344:43 - if I isolate y, let's say minus six y equals
minus 3x plus two divided by minus six, that's
344:50 - y equals one half x minus 1/3. So indeed,
they have the same slope. And so they're parallel
344:59 - with different In intercepts, and so they
can have no intersection. And so it makes
345:04 - sense that we have no solution to our system
of linear equations. This kind of system that
345:10 - has no solution is called an inconsistent
system. In this third example, yet a third
345:18 - behavior happens. This time, I think I'm going
to solve by substitution because I already
345:24 - have X with a coefficient of one. So it's
really easy to just isolate X in the first
345:30 - equation, and then plug in to the second equation
to get three times six minus five y plus 15,
345:39 - y equals 18. If I distribute out, I get the
strange phenomenon that the 15 y's cancel
345:46 - and I just get 18 equals 18, which is always
true. This is what's called a dependent system
345:54 - of linear equations. If you look more closely,
you can see that the second equation is really
346:00 - just a constant multiple, the first equation
is just three times every term is three times
346:06 - as big as the corresponding term and the first
equation. So there's no new information in
346:10 - the second equation, anything, any x and y
values that satisfy the first one will satisfy
346:16 - the second one. So this system of equations
has infinitely many solutions. Any ordered
346:23 - pair x y, where X plus five y equals six,
or in other words, X's minus five y plus six
346:32 - will satisfy this system of equations. That
would include a y value of zero corresponding
346:40 - x value of six or a y value of one corresponding
to an x value of one, or a y value of 1/3.
346:49 - Corresponding to an x value of 13 thirds just
by plugging into this equation will work.
346:55 - Graphically, if I graph both of these equations,
the lines will just be on top of each other,
347:00 - so I'll just see one line. In this video,
we've solved systems of linear equations,
347:06 - using the method of substitution and the method
of elimination. We've seen that systems of
347:13 - linear equations can have one solution. When
the lines that the equations represent intersect
347:19 - in one point, they can be inconsistent, and
have no solutions that corresponds to parallel
347:26 - lines, or they can be dependent and have infinitely
many solutions that corresponds to the lines
347:33 - lying on top of each other. In this video,
I'll work through a problem involving distance
347:39 - rate and time. The key relationship to keep
in mind is that the rate of travel is the
347:46 - distance traveled divided by the time it takes
to travel again. For example, if you're driving
347:51 - 60 miles an hour, that's your rate. And that's
because you're going a distance of 60 miles
347:57 - in one hour. Sometimes it's handy to rewrite
that relationship by multiplying both sides
348:02 - by T time. And that gives us that R times
T is equal to D. In other words, distance
348:10 - is equal to rate times time. There's one more
important principle to keep in mind. And that's
348:15 - the idea that rates add. For example, if you
normally walk at three miles per hour, but
348:23 - you're walking on a moving sidewalk, that's
going at a rate of two miles per hour, then
348:29 - your total speed of travel with respect to
you know something stationary is going to
348:34 - be three plus two, or five miles per hour.
All right, that is a formula as our one or
348:43 - the first rate per second rate is equal to
the total rate. Let's use those two key ideas.
348:51 - distance equals rate times time, and rates
add in the following problem. else's boat
348:59 - has a top speed of six miles per hour and
still water. While traveling on a river at
349:04 - top speed. She went 10 miles upstream in the
same amount of time she went 30 miles downstream,
349:10 - we're supposed to find the rate of the river
currents. I'm going to organize the information
349:15 - in this problem into a chart.
349:17 - During the course of Elsa stay, there were
two situations we need to keep in mind. For
349:23 - one period of time she was going upstream.
And for another period of time she was going
349:27 - downstream. For each of those, I'm going to
chart out the distance you traveled. The rate
349:35 - she went at and the time it took when she
was going upstream. She went a total distance
349:42 - of 10 miles. When she was going downstream
she went a longer distance of 30 miles. But
349:49 - the times to travel those two distances were
the same. Since I don't know what that time
349:55 - was, I'll just give it a variable I'll call
it T now Think about her rate of travel, the
350:02 - rate she traveled upstream was slower because
she was going against the current and faster
350:07 - when she was going downstream with the current.
We don't know what the speed of the current
350:11 - is, that's what we're trying to figure out.
So maybe I'll give it a variable R. But we
350:17 - do know that in still water also can go six
miles per hour. And when she's going downstream,
350:23 - since she's going with the direction of the
current rates should add, and her rate downstream
350:29 - should be six plus R, that's her rate, and
still water plus the rate of the current.
350:40 - On the other hand, when she's going upstream,
then she's going against the current, so her
350:46 - rate of six miles per hour, we need to subtract
the rate of the current from that. Now that
350:53 - we've charted out our information, we can
turn it into equations using the fact that
350:57 - distance equals rate times time, we actually
have two equations 10 equals six minus R times
351:04 - T, and 30 is equal to six plus R times T.
Now that we've converted our situation into
351:12 - a system of equations, our next job is to
solve the system of equations. In this example,
351:17 - I think the easiest way to proceed is to isolate
t in each of the two equations. So in the
351:23 - first equation, I'll divide both sides by
six minus r, and a second equation R divided
351:28 - by six plus R. That gives me 10 over six minus
r equals T, and 30 over six plus r equals
351:36 - t. Now if I set my T variables equal to each
other, I get, I get 10 over six minus r is
351:45 - equal to 30 over six plus R. I'm making progress
because now I have a single equation, the
351:52 - single variable that I need to solve. Since
the variable R is trapped in the denominator,
351:58 - I'm going to proceed by clearing the denominator.
So I'm going to multiply both sides by the
352:03 - least common denominator, that is six minus
r times six plus R. Once I cancel things out,
352:14 - I get that the six plus r times 10 is equal
to 30 times six minus r, if I distribute,
352:23 - I'm going to get 60 plus xR equals 180 minus
30 ar, which I can now solve, let's see, that's
352:36 - going to be 40 r is equal to 120. So our,
the speed of my current is going to be three
352:43 - miles per hour. This is all that the problem
asked for the speed of the current. If I also
352:51 - wanted to solve for the other unknown time,
I could do so by plugging in R into one of
352:57 - my equations and solving for T. In this video,
I saw the distance rate and time problem by
353:04 - charting out my information for the two situations
and my problem using the fact that rates add
353:12 - to fill in some of my boxes, and then using
the formula distance equals rate times time
353:17 - to build a system of equations. In this video,
I'll do a standard mixture problem in which
353:24 - we have to figure out what quantity of two
solutions to mix together. household bleach
353:30 - contains 6% sodium hypochlorite. The other
94% is water. How much household bleach should
353:39 - be combined with 70 liters of a weaker 1%
hypochlorite solution in order to form a solution,
353:50 - that's 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. I want to
turn this problem into a system of equations.
353:59 - So I'm asking myself what quantities are going
to be equal to each other? Well, the total
354:05 - amount of sodium hypochlorite that has symbol
and a co o before mixing,
354:14 - it should equal the total amount of sodium
hypochlorite after mixing. Also, the total
354:23 - amount of water before mixing should equal
the total amount of water after. And finally,
354:30 - there's just the total amount of solution.
In my two jugs, sodium hypochlorite together
354:37 - with water should equal the total amount of
solution after that gives me a hint for what
354:47 - I'm looking for. But before I start reading
out equations, I find it very helpful to chart
354:51 - out my quantities. So I've got the 6% solution.
The household leech, I've got the 1% solution.
355:05 - And I've got my Desired Ending 2.5% solution.
Now on each of those solutions, I've got a
355:16 - certain volume of sodium hypochlorite. I've
also got a volume of water. And I've got a
355:26 - total volume of solution. Let me see which
of these boxes I can actually fill in, I know
355:37 - that I'm adding 70 liters of the 1% solution.
So I can put a 70 in the total volume of solution
355:45 - here. I don't know what volume of the household
bleach, I want to add, that's what I'm trying
355:53 - to find out. So I'm going to just call that
volume x. Now since my 2.5% solution is made
356:02 - by combining my other two solutions, I know
its volume is going to be the sum of these
356:08 - two volumes, so I'll write 70 plus x in this
box. Now, the 6% solution means that whatever
356:16 - the volume of solution is, 6% of that is the
sodium hypochlorite. So the volume of the
356:22 - sodium hypochlorite is going to be 0.06 times
x, the volume of water and that solution is
356:31 - whatever's left, so that's going to be x minus
0.06x, or point nine four times X with the
356:40 - following the same reasoning for the 1% solution
1% of the 70 liters is a sodium hypochlorite.
356:46 - So that's going to be 0.01 times 70. Or point
seven, the volume of water and that solution
356:56 - is going to be 99% or point nine, nine times
seven day. That works out to 69.3. Finally,
357:05 - for the 2.5% solution, the volume of the sodium
hypochlorite is going to be 0.0 to five times
357:15 - the volume of solution 70 plus x and the volume
of water is going to be the remainder. So
357:22 - that's 0.975 times 70 plus x. Now I've already
used the fact that the volume of solutions
357:32 - before added up is the volume of solution
after in writing a 70 plus x in this box.
357:39 - But I haven't yet used the fact that the volume
of the sodium hypochlorite is preserved before
357:43 - and after. So I can write that down as an
equation. So that means 0.06x plus 0.7 is
357:53 - equal to 0.025 times 70 plus x. Now I've got
an equation with a variable. I'll try to solve
358:01 - it. Since I don't like all these decimals,
I'm going to multiply both sides of my equation
358:06 - by let's see, 1000 should get rid of all the
decimals. After distributing, I get 60x plus
358:15 - 700 equals 25 times 70 plus x. Distributing
some more, I get 60x plus 700 is equal to
358:27 - 1750 plus 25x. So let's see 60 minus 25 is
35x is equal to 1050. Which gives me that
358:42 - x equals 30 liters of the household bleach.
358:49 - Notice that I never actually had to use the
fact that the water quantity of water before
358:54 - mixing is equal to the quantity of water after
that is I never use the information in this
359:00 - column. In fact, that information is redundant.
Once I know that the quantities of sodium
359:08 - hypochlorite add up, and the total volume
of solutions add up. The fact that that volume
359:15 - of waters add up is just redundant information.
The techniques to use to solve this equation
359:21 - involving solutions can be used to solve many
many other equations involving mixtures of
359:28 - items. My favorite method is to first make
a chart involving the types of mixtures and
359:36 - the types of items in your mixture. Fill in
as many boxes size I can and then use the
359:43 - fact that the quantities add. This video is
about rational functions and their graphs.
359:53 - Recall that a rational function is a function
that can be written as a ratio or quotient
359:59 - of two power. No Here's an example. The simpler
function, f of x equals one over x is also
360:07 - considered a rational function, you can think
of one and x as very simple polynomials. The
360:14 - graph of this rational function is shown here.
This graph looks different from the graph
360:20 - of a polynomial. For one thing, its end behavior
is different. The end behavior of a function
360:27 - is the way the graph looks when x goes through
really large positive, or really large negative
360:33 - numbers, we've seen that the end behavior
of a polynomial always looks like one of these
360:38 - cases. That is why marches off to infinity
or maybe negative infinity, as x gets really
360:44 - big or really negative. But this rational
function has a different type of end behavior.
360:50 - Notice, as x gets really big, the y values
are leveling off
360:54 - at about a y value of three. And similarly,
as x values get really negative, our graph
361:00 - is leveling off near the line y equals three,
I'll draw that line, y equals three on my
361:07 - graph, that line is called a horizontal asymptote.
A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line
361:16 - that our graph gets closer and closer to as
x goes to infinity, or as X goes to negative
361:21 - infinity, or both. There's something else
that's different about this graph from a polynomial
361:26 - graph, look at what happens as x gets close
to negative five. As we approach negative
361:32 - five with x values on the right, our Y values
are going down towards negative infinity.
361:37 - And as we approach the x value of negative
five from the left, our Y values are going
361:42 - up towards positive infinity. We say that
this graph has a vertical asymptote at x equals
361:49 - negative five. A vertical asymptote is a vertical
line that the graph gets closer and closer
361:56 - to. Finally, there's something really weird
going on at x equals two, there's a little
362:02 - open circle there, like the value at x equals
two is dug out. That's called a hole. A hole
362:10 - is a place along the curve of the graph where
the function doesn't exist. Now that we've
362:16 - identified some of the features of our rational
functions graph,
362:19 - I want to look back at the equation and see
how we could have predicted those features
362:24 - just by looking at the equation. To find horizontal
asymptotes, we need to look at what our function
362:31 - is doing when x goes through really big positive
or really big negative numbers. Looking at
362:36 - our equation for our function, the numerator
is going to be dominated by the 3x squared
362:42 - term when x is really big, right, because
three times x squared is going to be absolutely
362:47 - enormous compared to this negative 12. If
x is a big positive or negative number, in
362:53 - the denominator, the denominator will be dominated
by the x squared term. Again, if x is a really
362:59 - big positive or negative number, like a million,
a million squared will be much, much bigger
363:04 - than three times a million or negative 10.
For that reason, to find the end behavior,
363:10 - or the horizontal asymptote, for our function,
we just need to look at the term on the numerator
363:18 - and the term on the denominator that have
the highest exponent, those are the ones that
363:22 - dominate the expression in size. So as x gets
really big, our functions y values are going
363:29 - to be approximately 3x squared over x squared,
which is three. That's why we have a horizontal
363:37 - asymptote at y equals three. Now our vertical
asymptotes, those tend to occur where our
363:45 - denominator of our function is zero. That's
because the function doesn't exist when our
363:51 - denominator is zero. And when we get close
to that place where our denominator is zero,
363:56 - we're going to be dividing by tiny, tiny numbers,
which will make our Y values really big in
364:01 - magnitude. So to check where our denominators
zero, let's factor our function. In fact,
364:06 - I'm going to go ahead and factor the numerator
and the denominator. So the numerator factors,
364:11 - let's see, pull out the three, I get x squared
minus four, factor in the denominator, that
364:18 - factors into X plus five times x minus two,
I can factor a little the numerator a little
364:25 - further, that's three times x minus two times
x plus two over x plus 5x minus two. Now,
364:34 - when x is equal to negative five, my denominator
will be zero, but my numerator will not be
364:41 - zero. That's what gives me the vertical asymptote
at x equals negative five. Notice that when
364:49 - x equals two, the denominator is zero, but
the numerator is also zero. In fact, if I
364:57 - cancelled the x minus two factor from the
numerator, and in nominator, I get a simplified
365:01 - form for my function that agrees with my original
function as long as x is not equal to two.
365:11 - That's because when x equals two, the simplified
function exists, but the original function
365:16 - does not, it's zero over zero, it's undefined.
But for every other x value, including x values
365:23 - near x equals to our original functions just
the same as this function. And that's why
365:29 - our function only has a vertical asymptote
at x equals negative five, not one at x equals
365:36 - two, because the x minus two factor is no
longer in the function after simplifying,
365:41 - it does have a hole at x equals two, because
the original function is not defined there,
365:45 - even though the simplified version is if we
want to find the y value of our hole, we can
365:52 - just plug in x equals two into our simplified
version of our function, that gives a y value
365:59 - of three times two plus two over two plus
seven, or 12 ninths, which simplifies to four
366:06 - thirds. So our whole is that to four thirds.
Now that we've been through one example in
366:15 - detail, let's summarize our findings. We find
the vertical asymptotes and the holes by looking
366:22 - where the denominator is zero. The holes happen
where the denominator and numerator are both
366:29 - zero and those factors cancel out. The vertical
asymptotes are all other x values where the
366:35 - denominator is zero, we find the horizontal
asymptotes. By considering the highest power
366:42 - term on the numerator and the denominator,
I'll explain this process in more detail in
366:47 - three examples. In the first example, if we
circle the highest power terms, that simplifies
366:55 - to 5x over 3x squared, which is five over
3x. As x gets really big, the denominator
367:03 - is going to be huge. So I'm going to be dividing
five by a huge, huge number, that's going
367:09 - to be going very close to zero. And therefore
we have a horizontal asymptote
367:15 - at y equals zero. In the second example, the
highest power terms, 2x cubed, over 3x cubed
367:24 - simplifies to two thirds. So as x gets really
big, we're going to be heading towards two
367:30 - thirds, and we have a horizontal asymptote
at y equals two thirds. In the third example,
367:36 - the highest power terms, x squared over 2x
simplifies to x over two. As x gets really
367:45 - big, x over two is getting really big. And
therefore, we don't have a horizontal asymptote
367:51 - at all. This is going to infinity, when x
gets through go through big positive numbers,
367:59 - and is going to negative infinity when x goes
through a big negative numbers. So in this
368:07 - case, the end behavior is kind of like that
of a polynomial, and there's no horizontal
368:12 - asymptote. In general, when the degree of
the numerator is smaller than the degree of
368:18 - the denominator, we're in this first case
where the denominator gets really big compared
368:23 - to the numerator and we go to zero. In the
second case, where the degree of the numerator
368:29 - and the degree of the dominant are equal,
things cancel out, and so we get a horizontal
368:34 - asymptote at the y value, that's equal to
the ratio of the leading coefficients. Finally,
368:42 - in the third case, when the degree of the
numerator is bigger than the degree of the
368:46 - denominator, then the numerator is getting
really big compared to the denominator, so
368:52 - we end up with no horizontal asymptote. Final
Finally, let's apply all these observations
368:57 - to one more example. Please pause the video
and take a moment to find the vertical asymptotes,
369:03 - horizontal asymptotes and holes for this rational
function. To find the vertical asymptotes
369:09 - and holes, we need to look at where the denominator
is zero. In fact, it's going to be handy to
369:15 - factor both the numerator and the denominator.
Since there if there are any common factors,
369:20 - we might have a whole instead of a vertical
asymptote. The numerator is pretty easy to
369:25 - factor. Let's see that's 3x times x plus one
for the denominator or first factor out an
369:31 - x. And then I'll factor some more using a
guess and check method. I know that I'll need
369:40 - a 2x and an X to multiply together to the
2x squared and I'll need a three and a minus
369:47 - one or alpha minus three and a one. Let's
see if that works. If I multiply out 2x minus
369:56 - one times x plus three that does get me back
to x squared plus 5x minus three, so that
370:02 - checks out. Now I noticed that I have a common
factor of x in both the numerator and the
370:08 - denominator. So that's telling me I'm going
to have a hole at x equals zero. In fact,
370:14 - I could rewrite my rational function by cancelling
out that common factor. And that's equivalent,
370:21 - as long as x is not equal to zero. So the
y value of my whole is what I get when I plug
370:28 - zero into my simplified version, that would
be three times zero plus one over two times
370:35 - zero minus one times zero plus three, which
is three over negative three or minus one.
370:42 - So my whole is at zero minus one. Now all
the remaining places in my denominator that
370:49 - make my denominator zero will get me vertical
asymptotes. So I'll have a vertical asymptote,
370:55 - when 2x minus one times x plus three equals
zero, that is, when 2x minus one is zero,
371:04 - or x plus three is zero. In other words, when
x is one half, or x equals negative three.
371:13 - Finally, to find my horizontal asymptotes,
I just need to consider the highest power
371:20 - term in the numerator and the denominator.
That simplifies to three over 2x, which is
371:28 - bottom heavy, right? When x gets really big,
this expression is going to zero. And that
371:35 - means that we have a horizontal asymptote
at y equals zero. So we found the major features
371:41 - of our graph, the whole, the vertical asymptotes
and the horizontal asymptotes. Together, this
371:48 - would give us a framework for what the graph
of our function looks like. horizontal asymptote
371:54 - at y equals zero, vertical asymptotes at x
equals one half, and x equals minus three
372:02 - at a hole at the point zero minus one. plotting
a few more points, or using a graphing calculator
372:09 - of graphing program, we can see that our actual
function will look something like this.
372:17 - Notice that the x intercept when x is negative
one, corresponds to where the numerator of
372:24 - our rational function or reduced rational
function is equal to zero. That's because
372:29 - a zero on the numerator that doesn't make
the denominator zero makes the whole function
372:33 - zero. And an X intercept is where the y value
of the whole function is zero. In this video,
372:40 - we learned how to find horizontal asymptotes
have rational functions. By looking at the
372:44 - highest power terms, we learned to find the
vertical asymptotes and holes. By looking
372:50 - at the factored version of the functions.
The holes correspond to the x values that
372:56 - make the numerator and denominator zero, his
corresponding factors cancel. The vertical
373:03 - asymptotes correspond to the x values that
make the denominator zero, even after factoring
373:09 - any any common and in common factors in the
numerator denominator.
373:13 - This video is about combining functions by
adding them subtracting them multiplying and
373:19 - dividing them. Suppose we have two functions,
f of x equals x plus one and g of x equals
373:26 - x squared. One way to combine them is by adding
them together. This notation, f plus g of
373:34 - x means the function defined by taking f of
x and adding it to g of x. So for our functions,
373:43 - that means we take x plus one and add x squared,
I can rearrange that as the function x squared
373:50 - plus x plus one. So f plus g evaluated on
x means x squared plus x plus one. And if
374:01 - I wanted to evaluate f plus g, on the number
two, that would be two squared plus two plus
374:08 - one, or seven. Similarly, the notation f minus
g of x means the function we get by taking
374:18 - f of x and subtracting g of x. So that would
be x plus one minus x squared. And if I wanted
374:25 - to take f minus g evaluated at one, that would
be one plus one minus one squared, or one,
374:35 - the notation F dot g of x, which is sometimes
also written just as f g of x. That means
374:44 - we take f of x times g of x. In other words,
x plus one times x squared, which could be
374:52 - simplified as x cubed plus x squared. The
notation f divided by g of x means I take
375:02 - f of x and divided by g of x. So that would
be x plus one divided by x squared. In this
375:11 - figure, the blue graph represents h of x.
And the red graph represents the function
375:19 - p of x, we're asked to find h minus p of zero.
375:26 - We don't have any equations to work with,
but that's okay. We know that for any x, h
375:32 - minus p of x is defined as h of x minus p
of x. So for x equals zero, H minus p of zero
375:40 - is going to be h of zero minus p of zero.
Using the graph, we can find h of zero by
375:48 - finding the value of zero on the x axis, and
finding the corresponding y value for the
375:55 - function h of x. So that's about 1.8. Now
P of zero, we can find similarly by looking
376:04 - for zero on the x axis, and finding the corresponding
y value for the function p of x, and that's
376:10 - a y value of one 1.8 minus one is 0.8. So
that's our approximate value for H minus p
376:18 - of zero. If we want to find P times h of negative
three, again, we can rewrite that as P of
376:28 - negative three times h of negative three.
And using the graphs, we see that for an x
376:34 - value of negative three, the y value for P
is two. And the x value of negative three
376:45 - corresponds to a y value of negative two for
H.
376:50 - Two times negative two is negative four. So
that's our value for P times h of negative
376:55 - three.
376:56 - In this video, we saw how to add two functions,
subtract two functions, multiply two functions,
377:03 - and divide two functions in the following
way. When you compose two functions, you apply
377:13 - the first function, and then you apply the
second function to the output of the first
377:19 - function. For example, the first function
might compute population size from time in
377:27 - years. So its input would be time in years,
since a certain date, as output would be number
377:35 - of people in the population. The second function
g, might compute health care costs as a function
377:45 - of population size. So it will take population
size as input, and its output will be healthcare
377:53 - costs. If you put these functions together,
that is compose them, then you'll go all the
378:00 - way from time in years to healthcare costs.
This is your composition, g composed with
378:07 - F. The composition of two functions, written
g with a little circle, f of x is defined
378:16 - as follows. g composed with f of x is G evaluated
on f of x, we can think of it schematically
378:26 - and diagram f x on a number x and produces
a number f of x, then g takes that output
378:36 - f of x and produces a new number, g of f of
x. Our composition of functions g composed
378:45 - with F is the function that goes all the way
from X to g of f of x. Let's work out some
378:51 - examples where our functions are defined by
tables of values. If we want to find g composed
378:58 - with F of four, by definition, this means
g of f of four. To evaluate this expression,
379:08 - we always work from the inside out. So we
start with the x value of four, and we find
379:15 - f of four, using the table of values for f
of x, when x equals four, f of x is seven,
379:23 - so we can replace F of four with the number
seven. Now we need to evaluate g of seven,
379:33 - seven becomes our new x value in our table
of values for G, the x value of seven corresponds
379:39 - to the G of X value of 10. So g of seven is
equal to 10. We found that g composed with
379:47 - F of four is equal to 10. If instead we want
to find f composed with g of four, well, we
379:56 - can rewrite that as f of g of four Again work
from the inside out. Now we're trying to find
380:04 - g of four. So four is our x value. And we
use our table of values for G to see that
380:10 - g of four is one. So we replaced you a four
by one. And now we need to evaluate f of one.
380:20 - Using our table for F values, f of one is
eight. Notice that when we've computed g of
380:29 - f of four, we got a different answer than
when we computed f of g of four. And in general,
380:36 - g composed with F is not the same thing as
f composed with g. Please pause the video
380:43 - and take a moment to compute the next two
examples. We can replace f composed with F
380:49 - of two by the equivalent expression, f of
f of two. Working from the inside out, we
380:56 - know that f of two is three, and f of three
is six. If we want to find f composed with
381:06 - g of six, rewrite that as f of g of six, using
the table for g, g of six is eight. But F
381:17 - of eight, eight is not on the table as an
x value for the for the f function. And so
381:25 - there is no F of eight, this does not exist,
we can say that six is not in the domain,
381:35 - for F composed with g. Even though it was
in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all
381:42 - the way through and get a value for F composed
with g of six. Next, let's turn our attention
381:49 - to the composition of functions that are given
by equations.
381:54 - p of x is x squared plus x and q of x as negative
2x. We want to find q composed with P of one.
382:03 - As usual, I can rewrite this as Q of P of
one and work from the inside out. P of one
382:14 - is one squared plus one, so that's two. So
this is the same thing as Q of two. But Q
382:21 - of two is negative two times two or negative
four. So this evaluates to negative four.
382:28 - In this next example, we want to find q composed
with P of some arbitrary x, or rewrite it
382:35 - as usual as Q of p of x and work from the
inside out. Well, p of x, we know the formula
382:44 - for that. That's x squared plus x. So I can
replace my P of x with that expression. Now,
382:52 - I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus
x. Well, Q of anything is negative two times
382:59 - that thing. So q of x squared plus x is going
to be negative two times the quantity x squared
383:08 - plus x, what I've done is I've substituted
in the whole expression x squared plus x,
383:13 - where I saw the X in this formula for q of
x, it's important to use the parentheses here.
383:20 - So that will be multiplying negative two by
the whole expression and not just by the first
383:24 - piece, I can simplify this a bit as negative
2x squared minus 2x. And that's my expression
383:32 - for Q composed with p of x. Notice that if
I wanted to compute q composed with P of one,
383:40 - which I already did in the first problem,
I could just use this expression now, negative
383:45 - two times one squared minus two and I get
negative four, just like I did before. Let's
383:52 - try another one. Let's try p composed with
q of x. First I read write this P of q of
384:00 - x. Working from the inside out, I can replace
q of x with negative 2x. So I need to compute
384:07 - P of negative 2x. Here's my formula for P.
to compute P of this expression, I need to
384:15 - plug in this expression everywhere I see an
x in the formula for P. So that means negative
384:23 - 2x squared plus negative 2x. Again, being
careful to use parentheses to make sure I
384:29 - plug in the entire expression in forex. let
me simplify. This is 4x squared minus 2x.
384:40 - Notice that I got different expressions for
Q of p of x, and for P of q of x. Once again,
384:50 - we see that q composed with P is not necessarily
equal to P composed with Q. Please pause the
384:57 - video and try this last example yourself.
rewriting. And working from the inside out,
385:06 - we're going to replace p of x with its expression
x squared plus x. And then we need to evaluate
385:13 - p on x squared plus x. That means we plug
in x squared plus x, everywhere we see an
385:22 - x in this formula, so that's x squared plus
x quantity squared plus x squared plus x.
385:29 - Once again, I can simplify by distributing
out, that gives me x to the fourth plus 2x
385:36 - cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x,
or x to the fourth plus 2x cubed plus 2x squared
385:45 - plus x. In this last set of examples, we're
asked to go backwards, we're given a formula
385:52 - for a function of h of x. But we're supposed
to rewrite h of x as a composition of two
385:57 - functions, F and G. Let's think for a minute,
which of these two functions gets applied
386:04 - first, f composed with g of x, let's see,
that means f of g of x. And since we evaluate
386:13 - these expressions from the inside out, we
must be applying g first, and then F. In order
386:21 - to figure out what what f and g could be,
I like to draw a box around some thing inside
386:27 - my expression for H, so I'm going to draw
a box around x squared plus seven, then whatever's
386:32 - inside the box, that'll be my function, g
of x, the first function that gets applied,
386:38 - whatever happens to the box, in this case,
taking the square root sign, that becomes
386:43 - my outside function, my second function f.
386:46 - So here, we're gonna say g of x is equal to
x squared plus seven, and f of x is equal
386:54 - to the square root of x, let's just check
and make sure that this works. So I need to
387:00 - check that when I take the composition, f
composed with g, I need to get the same thing
387:08 - as my original h. So let's see, if I do f
composed with g of x, well, by definition,
387:17 - that's f of g of x, working from the inside
out, I can replace g of x with its formula
387:23 - x squared plus seven. So I need to evaluate
f of x squared plus seven. That means I plug
387:30 - in x squared plus seven, into the formula
for for F. So that becomes the square root
387:37 - of x squared plus seven to the it works because
it matches my original equation. So we found
387:44 - a correct answer a correct way of breaking
h down as a composition of two functions.
387:48 - But I do want to point out, this is not the
only correct answer. I'll write down my formula
387:54 - for H of X again, and this time, I'll put
the box in a different place, I'll just box
387:59 - the x squared. If I did that, then my inside
function of my first function, g of x would
388:08 - be x squared. And my second function is what
happens to the box. So my f of x is what happens
388:17 - to the box, and the box gets added seven to
it, and taking the square root. So in other
388:23 - words, f of x is going to be the square root
of x plus seven. Again, I can check that this
388:32 - works. If I do f composed with g of x, that's
f of g of x. So now g of x is x squared. So
388:39 - I'm taking f of x squared. When I plug in
x squared for x, I do in fact, get the square
388:46 - root of x squared plus seven. So this is that
alternative, correct solution. In this video,
388:53 - we learn to evaluate the composition of functions.
by rewriting it and working from the inside
389:00 - out. We also learn to break apart a complicated
function into a composition of two functions
389:10 - by boxing one piece of the function and letting
the first function applied in the composition.
389:16 - Let that be the inside of the box, and the
second function applied in the composition
389:21 - be whatever happens to the box.
389:33 - The inverse of a function undoes what the
function does. So the inverse of tying your
389:38 - shoes would be to untie them. And the inverse
of the function that adds two to a number
389:46 - would be the function that subtracts two from
a number. This video introduces inverses and
389:53 - their properties. Suppose f of x is a function
defined by this chart. In other words, Have
390:00 - two is three, f of three is five, f of four
is six, and f of five is one, the inverse
390:08 - function for F written f superscript. Negative
1x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to
390:17 - three, F inverse takes three, back to two.
So we write this f superscript, negative one
390:26 - of three is to. Similarly, since f takes three
to five, F inverse takes five to three. And
390:38 - since f takes four to six, f inverse of six
is four. And since f takes five to one, f
390:46 - inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers
to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart
390:54 - of values when y equals f of x and the chart
of values when y equals f inverse of x are
391:00 - closely related. They share the same numbers,
but the x values for f of x correspond to
391:07 - the y values for f inverse of x, and the y
values for f of x correspond to the x values
391:14 - for f inverse of x. That leads us to the first
key fact inverse functions reverse the roles
391:21 - of y and x. I'm going to plot the points for
y equals f of x in blue. Next, I'll plot the
391:29 - points for y equals f inverse of x in red.
Pause the video for a moment and see what
391:35 - kind of symmetry you observe in this graph.
How are the blue points related to the red
391:40 - points, you might have noticed that the blue
points and the red points are mirror images
391:46 - over the mirror line, y equals x. So our second
key fact is that the graph of y equals f inverse
391:55 - of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals
f
391:58 - of x
391:59 - by reflecting over the line y equals x. This
makes sense, because inverses, reverse the
392:06 - roles of war annex. In the same example, let's
compute f inverse of f of two, this open circle
392:15 - means composition. In other words, we're computing
f inverse of f of two, we compute this from
392:23 - the inside out. So that's f inverse of three.
Since F of two is three, and f inverse of
392:33 - three, we see as to similarly, we can compute
f of f inverse of three. And that means we
392:44 - take f of f inverse of three. Since f inverse
of three is two, that's the same thing as
392:52 - computing F of two, which is three. Please
pause the video for a moment and compute these
393:02 - other compositions. You should have found
that in every case, if you take f inverse
393:11 - of f of a number, you get back to the very
same number you started with. And similarly,
393:16 - if you take f of f inverse of any number,
you get back to the same number you started
393:20 - with. So in general, f inverse of f of x is
equal to x, and f of f inverse of x is also
393:29 - equal to x. This is the mathematical way of
saying that F and n f inverse undo each other.
393:37 - Let's look at a different example. Suppose
that f of x is x cubed. Pause the video for
393:43 - a moment, and guess what the inverse of f
should be. Remember, F inverse undoes the
393:48 - work that F does. You might have guessed that
f inverse of x is going to be the cube root
393:57 - function, we can check that this is true by
looking at f of f inverse of x, that's F of
394:05 - the cube root of function, which means the
cube root function
394:09 - cubed, which gets us back to x. Similarly,
if we compute f inverse of f of x, that's
394:16 - the cube root of x cubed.
394:19 - And we get back to excellence again. So the
cube root function really is the inverse of
394:25 - the cubing function. When we compose the two
functions, we get back to the number that
394:30 - we started with. It'd be nice to have a more
systematic way of finding inverses of functions
394:37 - besides guessing and checking. One method
uses the fact that inverses reverse the roles
394:44 - of y and x. So if we want to find the inverse
of the function, f of x equals five minus
394:50 - x over 3x. We can write it as y equals five
minus x over 3x. Reverse the roles of y and
394:59 - x To get x equals five minus y over three
y, and then solve for y. To solve for y, let's
395:09 - multiply both sides by three y. Bring all
terms with y's in them to the left side, and
395:19 - alternate without wizened them to the right
side, factor out the why. And divide to isolate
395:28 - why this gives us f inverse of x as five over
3x plus one. Notice that our original function
395:40 - f and our inverse function, f inverse are
both rational functions, but they're not the
395:46 - reciprocals of each other. And in general,
f inverse of x is not usually equal to one
395:53 - over f of x. This can be confusing, because
when we write two to the minus one, that does
396:01 - mean one of our two, but f to the minus one
of x means the inverse function and not the
396:08 - reciprocal. It's natural to ask us all functions
have inverse functions. That is for any function
396:16 - you might encounter. Is there always a function
that its is its inverse? In fact, the answer
396:23 - is no. See, if you can come up with an example
of a function that does not have an inverse
396:30 - function. The word function here is key. Remember
that a function is a relationship between
396:37 - x values and y values, such that for each
x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding
396:47 - y value. One example of a function that does
not have an inverse function is the function
396:57 - f of x equals x squared.
397:01 - To see that,
397:02 - the inverse of this function is not a function.
Note that for the x squared function, the
397:09 - number two and the number negative two, both
go to number four. So if I had an inverse,
397:17 - you would have to send four to both two and
negative two, the inverse would not be a function,
397:27 - it might be easier to understand the problem,
when you look at a graph of y equals x squared.
397:34 - Recall that inverse functions reverse the
roles of y and x and flip the graph over the
397:40 - line y equals x. But when I flipped the green
graph over the line y equals x, I get this
397:47 - red graph. This red graph is not the graph
of a function because it violates the vertical
397:53 - line test. The reason that violates the vertical
line test is because the original green function
397:59 - violates the horizontal line test, and has
2x values with the same y value. In general,
398:10 - a function f has an inverse function if and
only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal
398:14 - line test, ie every horizontal line intersects
the graph. In it most one point, pause the
398:21 - video for a moment and see which of these
four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test.
398:26 - In other words, which of the four corresponding
functions would have an inverse function?
398:34 - You may have found that graphs A and B violate
the horizontal line test. So their functions
398:42 - would not have inverse functions. But graph
C and D satisfy the horizontal line test.
398:48 - So these graphs represent functions that do
have inverses. functions that satisfy the
398:54 - horizontal line test are sometimes called
One to One functions. Equivalently a function
399:02 - is one to one, if for any two different x
values, x one and x two, the y value is f
399:10 - of x one and f of x two are different numbers.
Sometimes, as I said, f is one to one, if,
399:18 - whenever f of x one is equal to f of x two,
then x one has to equal x two. As our last
399:27 - example, let's try to find P inverse of x,
where p of x is the square root of x minus
399:32 - two drawn here. If we graph P inverse on the
same axis as p of x, we get the following
399:40 - graph simply by flipping over the line y equals
x. If we try to solve the problem algebraically
399:49 - we can write y equal to a squared of x minus
two, reverse the roles of y and x and solve
399:56 - for y by squaring both sides adding two. Now
if we were to graph y equals x squared plus
400:07 - two, that would look like a parabola, it would
look like the red graph we've already drawn
400:13 - together with another arm on the left side.
But we know that our actual inverse function
400:22 - consists only of this right arm, we can specify
this algebraically by making the restriction
400:31 - that x has to be bigger than or equal to zero.
This corresponds to the fact that on the original
400:40 - graph for the square root of x, y was only
greater than or equal to zero. Looking more
400:47 - closely at the domain and range of P and P
inverse, we know that the domain of P is all
400:55 - values of x such that x minus two is greater
than or equal to zero. Since we can't take
401:01 - the square root of a negative number. This
corresponds to x values being greater than
401:07 - or equal to two, or an interval notation,
the interval from two to infinity. The range
401:14 - of P, we can see from the graph is all y value
is greater than or equal to zero, or the interval
401:20 - from zero to infinity. Similarly, based on
the graph, we see the domain of P inverse
401:29 - is x values greater than or equal to zero,
the interval from zero to infinity. And the
401:34 - range of P inverse is Y values greater than
or equal to two, or the interval from two
401:40 - to infinity. If you look closely at these
domains and ranges, you'll notice that the
401:45 - domain of P corresponds exactly to the range
of P inverse, and the range of P corresponds
401:53 - to the domain of P inverse.
401:57 - This makes sense, because inverse functions
reverse the roles of y and x. The domain of
402:04 - f inverse of x is the x values for F inverse,
which corresponds to the y values or the range
402:10 - of F. The range of f inverse is the y values
for F inverse, which correspond to the x values
402:18 - or the domain of f. In this video, we discussed
five key properties of inverse functions.
402:28 - inverse functions, reverse the roles of y
and x. The graph of y equals f inverse of
402:36 - x is the graph of y equals f of x reflected
over the line y equals x. When we compose
402:47 - F with F inverse, we get the identity function
y equals x. And similarly, when we compose
402:56 - f inverse with F, that brings x to x. In other
words, F and F inverse undo each other. The
403:04 - function f of x has an inverse function if
and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies
403:18 - the horizontal line test. And finally, the
domain of f is the range of f inverse and
403:31 - the range of f is the domain of f inverse.
