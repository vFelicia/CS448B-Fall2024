00:03 - hi i'm murali from free code cam today
00:06 - we are going to talk about what is a
00:08 - network so before we answer that
00:09 - question let's take the example of two
00:11 - people who are trying to communicate
00:13 - with each other so what happens here
00:14 - when one person talks he's creating
00:16 - vibrations in the air which is the
00:18 - medium and these vibrations reach the
00:20 - other party and
00:23 - that's how two people communicate so one
00:25 - person talks and the vibrations travel
00:27 - through the medium and reach the other
00:29 - person who is listening now in case of
00:31 - two computers how do they talk they
00:34 - don't have mouths yet or they can't
00:35 - create vibrations in their in the air so
00:38 - how do they talk so here what we have to
00:40 - do is we need to create some sort of
00:43 - connection between these two computers
00:45 - so a connection between two or more
00:48 - computers or more devices
00:51 - to communicate between them is called a
00:53 - network
00:58 - so how do we build a network there are
01:00 - multiple ways you can create a network
01:02 - the easiest way is to buy a simple
01:05 - wireless router and connect all of your
01:07 - devices to that in this example
01:09 - we have connected the desktop and
01:11 - printer using cables and we have
01:14 - connected the laptop using the wireless
01:16 - connection so these three devices can
01:19 - talk among each other easily using the
01:21 - wireless router so we have just created
01:24 - a network
01:28 - a lan is a local area network so what
01:30 - does it mean
01:31 - imagine you have your home and you have
01:34 - your own wireless router you got your
01:36 - desktop connected your laptop connector
01:38 - and a printer connected to this router
01:40 - and
01:41 - your neighbor has a similar setup he has
01:43 - his home router a desktop is connected
01:46 - and he's got two laptops and they're all
01:48 - in their own network so now what happens
01:51 - is
01:51 - this
01:52 - network which is in your home is a lan
01:55 - it is local to your home
01:57 - and this particular network
02:00 - in your neighbor's house is a different
02:02 - land so these two are two different
02:05 - local area networks
02:10 - we are going to talk about an important
02:12 - device in networking called a network
02:15 - interface card or nick
02:17 - so before we talk about that i want to
02:19 - give you an example of how humans
02:22 - communicate now imagine we have three
02:24 - different people john bob and mary how
02:26 - do they talk
02:27 - when you're talking you're using your
02:29 - mouth so you're transmitting information
02:31 - using the mouth and the other person
02:35 - is receiving the information through
02:37 - their ears now how do computers
02:40 - you know talk or listen
02:42 - they have a device called network
02:44 - interface card which acts as the ear
02:48 - and the mouth of the computer so that's
02:51 - how computers talk
02:53 - through the network interface card
03:00 - now imagine you want to connect devices
03:02 - across multiple cities or multiple
03:05 - continents now that's a huge network and
03:08 - that kind of network is called a van in
03:10 - this to explain this let's take an
03:12 - example of an office campus you can have
03:14 - multiple buildings you know multiple
03:16 - floors you have multiple computers in
03:19 - this different floors so how do you
03:21 - connect them you take a router and put
03:23 - it in each floor connect all the
03:25 - computers in in that floor to that
03:27 - particular router and you take a bigger
03:29 - router and you connect all of your
03:30 - routers to that and that's how you can
03:33 - create a small van
03:39 - what is a mac address let me remind you
03:41 - this has got nothing to do with the big
03:43 - mac or the mac operating system now
03:46 - before we get into the details let me
03:47 - give you an analogy now we have three
03:49 - people john bob and mary in a room who
03:52 - want to talk
03:53 - now john when he wants to talk to mary
03:55 - he says hi mary how are you doing now
03:58 - when mary listens to this message how
04:00 - does she know that she has to respond to
04:02 - john it's through his voice so she she
04:05 - replies to john but not bob saying hey
04:08 - john i'm doing good
04:10 - now if you have three different
04:11 - computers who want to talk to each other
04:14 - they don't have any names so to bring
04:16 - the analogy of names and identification
04:19 - to computers we have this concept of mac
04:23 - address which is unique
04:25 - to each computer's network interface
04:28 - card
04:33 - just like humans have names which are
04:35 - composed of alphabets we have
04:38 - hexadecimals for representing the mac
04:41 - addresses a mac address is 6 bytes long
04:44 - or 48 bits it is usually represented in
04:48 - this format you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 bytes
04:52 - which are separated by a colon or you
04:56 - can write two bytes together
04:58 - and separated by a
05:00 - dart
05:05 - we will see how computers talk before we
05:08 - do that i would like to give you an
05:09 - analogy of how people talk in this room
05:13 - we have john bob and mary and when john
05:16 - wants to talk to mary he says hi mary
05:18 - this is john how are you doing now when
05:20 - they are in the same room they are
05:23 - sharing the same medium which is the air
05:25 - and all all of them bob and mary hear to
05:28 - this
05:28 - message but only mary responds because
05:32 - it's addressed to mary in the same way
05:35 - when computers want to talk they share a
05:37 - medium in this example
05:40 - all these three computers are sharing a
05:42 - cable this is how
05:44 - networks were built in the past
05:46 - so you have nic cards for each of these
05:48 - computers and they have their own mac
05:50 - addresses now let's say if a wants to
05:53 - talk to b
05:54 - what a does is
05:56 - it sends a message to b which looks
05:59 - similar to this
06:01 - hey b
06:03 - you know you use the mac address to
06:05 - address b
06:06 - this is a talking and here is my message
06:09 - how are you doing now when this message
06:11 - is put on this medium
06:14 - everybody on this medium can listen to
06:16 - it so in this case b and c can listen to
06:20 - this message now what happens is when c
06:22 - looks at this message it sees that it's
06:24 - addressed to b so it just silently
06:26 - ignores it
06:27 - and b when it gets this message it sees
06:30 - that oh this message is at rest to me so
06:32 - let me reply and when it decides to
06:35 - reply what b does is
06:38 - i want to know who is talking so it
06:40 - looks at the original message and sees
06:42 - oh it's a who is talking so it says
06:45 - hey a
06:47 - this is b
06:48 - and the actual message i'm doing good
06:50 - that's how computers talk
06:57 - let's imagine
06:58 - there's a room and there are like three
07:00 - different people and when two people are
07:02 - talking the third person if he tries to
07:04 - talk the conversation becomes difficult
07:07 - for the other two people in the same way
07:10 - let's say we have three different
07:12 - computers on the same network now if a
07:17 - was talking to b
07:18 - and
07:19 - c suddenly transmits
07:22 - data to a there is a collision and when
07:25 - this collision happens the original
07:27 - message from a to b becomes garbage it's
07:30 - of no use anymore because there is
07:32 - interference so when there is a
07:34 - collision that happens
07:35 - a detects it and it backs off before it
07:38 - tries to send the message back to b
07:41 - again so this was in the original days
07:43 - of the networking but later
07:46 - what happened is they added the concept
07:48 - of collision avoidance so in that what
07:51 - happens is
07:53 - see
07:53 - before it actually starts sending data
07:56 - to a it tries to
07:58 - see if there is a conversation going on
08:00 - already before it sends so that's
08:04 - ca or collision avoidance
