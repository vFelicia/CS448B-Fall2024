00:00 - the ad event listener method attaches an
00:03 - event handler to the specified element
00:06 - without overwriting existing event
00:08 - handlers so you can add many event
00:10 - handlers to one element so here's the
00:12 - syntax uh you're going to put the
00:14 - element you're trying to access and then
00:16 - add event listener and then you're going
00:18 - to pass in the event and this is the
00:21 - type of event like click or Mouse down
00:24 - and then you're going to pass in the
00:25 - function and then the use capture this
00:28 - is a Boolean value specifying whether to
00:31 - use event bubbling or event capturing
00:33 - this is optional and I'll explain this
00:36 - in a little bit so we already have this
00:37 - HTML code displaying over here and we've
00:40 - already selected all of our elements so
00:43 - what I'm going to do is create an event
00:45 - listener so here we're attaching an
00:48 - event listener to the paragraph that's
00:50 - this first paragraph up here and it's
00:53 - going to be a click so on click we're
00:55 - going to run this function so we're just
00:57 - going to set the background of my div to
01:01 - light blue which it already is right now
01:03 - but if we reset everything it will go
01:06 - back to this
01:08 - Coral so now if I click the words it
01:11 - changes to light blue now this actually
01:13 - does the same thing that this other that
01:16 - onclick would do so when you use add
01:18 - event listener and pass and click for
01:20 - the event you could also do it like this
01:23 - you could set on click equal to this
01:25 - function here however there are some bad
01:27 - things about using onclick with on click
01:30 - you may have only one event assigned at
01:33 - a time so if you assign another event to
01:35 - on click it will overwrite the first
01:38 - event you also can't set the use capture
01:41 - so generally you want to use ad event
01:43 - listener however on click does work in
01:45 - all browsers and ad event listener does
01:48 - not work in older versions of Internet
01:50 - Explorer before Version 9 before Version
01:53 - 9 you have to use attach event instead
01:55 - of ad event listener okay instead of
01:58 - declaring our entire function in here we
02:01 - can actually just pass a function
02:03 - reference change text and then it will
02:05 - call that function then here it's going
02:07 - just going to set the text content of
02:09 - paragraph 2 to some other words so if I
02:13 - click here you can see that two things
02:15 - just happened the color changed to light
02:17 - blue and this text down here changed
02:21 - with onclick only this text would change
02:25 - because it would have overwritten the
02:27 - changing the background color but with
02:30 - add event listener both things can
02:31 - happen Okay this right here is an
02:33 - example of something besides click
02:35 - before we were using the click event now
02:38 - we're using the mouse over event so if I
02:40 - bring the mouse over the first div and
02:43 - we see it changes to dark khaki for div
02:46 - 2 now I'm going to talk about the used
02:48 - capture parameter this changes the order
02:51 - that things happen in so we have an
02:54 - event on the first paragraph and then we
02:57 - have an event on the first div so the my
03:00 - P and my div so when I'm clicking the
03:03 - paragraph I'm also clicking the div at
03:06 - the same time so the last parameter is
03:09 - is how it is determined which event to
03:12 - run first so let's add the last
03:14 - parameter here remember you don't need
03:16 - it because it defaults to false so the
03:19 - first event listener is going to run the
03:22 - change text function the second event
03:24 - listener is going to run the change text
03:26 - 2 function so we have to create that
03:28 - function so so here's change text 2
03:31 - change text and change text 2 are both
03:34 - going to change the second paragraph
03:37 - text content and this one is going to
03:40 - just take the text contents and add the
03:42 - real answer onto the end and we're going
03:44 - to make a slight modification to change
03:46 - text
03:48 - one now both change text and change text
03:51 - two are going to take the text content
03:52 - that's already there and then append new
03:56 - text and this will help us see what
03:58 - order the function
04:00 - are executed in if I click the paragraph
04:03 - one and the div at the same time you can
04:06 - see first it's appending the real answer
04:09 - and then it's appending according to a
04:12 - Cornel publication the answer is 700b so
04:16 - if this last parameter is set to true
04:18 - the outermost elements event is handled
04:21 - first and then the
04:23 - inner however if this is set to false
04:27 - the innermost elements event is handled
04:29 - first and then the outer so let's see an
04:32 - example of
04:33 - that and now here we can see first it
04:37 - ains according to Cornell publication
04:39 - the answer is
04:40 - 700b and then it appends the real answer
04:44 - so again when two event listeners are
04:47 - attached to two different elements but
04:49 - they're going to run at the same time
04:51 - the last parameter tells what order to
04:53 - run them in okay the last thing I want
04:56 - to talk about is remove event listener
04:58 - with remove event list listener it's
05:00 - pretty self-explanatory it just removes
05:02 - an event listener that you previously
05:04 - added you just have to make sure that
05:06 - the parameters that you pass in are
05:08 - exactly the same so it removes the exact
05:11 - one you can only remove an event
05:13 - listener where you are calling a
05:15 - function by a name here if you actually
05:18 - put in the function like this into the
05:20 - event listener then removing it won't
05:23 - work okay well thanks for watching my
05:25 - name is Bo KS don't forget to subscribe
05:28 - and remember use your code for good
