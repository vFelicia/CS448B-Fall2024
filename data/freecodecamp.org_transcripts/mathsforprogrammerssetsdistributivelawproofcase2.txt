00:00 - in this video i have the proof of the
00:01 - second case
00:03 - for the distributive law
00:05 - in this case we're showing that a
00:06 - intersection b
00:08 - union a intersection c is a subset of a
00:11 - intersection b union c
00:13 - so let's start by saying that
00:16 - suppose that x is an element of a
00:19 - intersection b union a intersection c
00:22 - then we know that x is an element of a
00:25 - intersection b or x is an element of a
00:28 - intersection c and we know this because
00:30 - of the definition of the union
00:33 - from here we can
00:36 - then state that x is an element of a and
00:39 - x is an element of b
00:41 - or x is an element of a
00:43 - and x is an element of c
00:45 - from that we can deduce that x is an
00:48 - element of a and x is an element of b or
00:51 - x is an element of c and here we um
00:54 - we sort of
00:55 - factored out the x as an element of a
00:58 - and
00:59 - and then regrouped x's element of b or x
01:02 - is an element of c
01:04 - and from here we can
01:05 - by definition right x is element of a
01:08 - and x is an element of b union c
01:11 - which finally we can state x's and
01:13 - elements of a intersection b union c
01:16 - which is what we wanted to show so there
01:18 - you have it we've proved that uh
01:21 - x is an element of both of these and
01:23 - therefore this is a subset of this and
01:26 - we've shown that
01:28 - both sides of the equation are subsets
01:31 - of each other and therefore the
01:33 - distributive law is in fact
01:35 - true it's proven
