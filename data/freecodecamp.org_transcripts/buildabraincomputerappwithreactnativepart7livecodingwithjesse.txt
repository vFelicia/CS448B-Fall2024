00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse i'm jesse and today
00:11 - we're going to add a demo mode to our
00:12 - app
00:14 - and i'll explain why right now so um
00:19 - if you haven't been with us for the last
00:21 - six live streams
00:23 - we've been building an app
00:25 - a brain computer app that works with a
00:28 - brain computer interface
00:30 - to grab
00:32 - your brain waves
00:34 - measure them to see how focused you are
00:36 - and then warn you
00:38 - if your focus is dropping below a
00:40 - certain level
00:41 - we successfully submitted that app to
00:43 - the google play store
00:46 - and then we submitted it to
00:49 - the
00:50 - apple app store
00:52 - and it took a while
00:55 - to get any feedback back but you can see
00:57 - on the screen now
00:59 - i did get
01:00 - some feedback for that app
01:03 - so i just got that feedback probably
01:07 - at some point in the past week
01:10 - so
01:12 - basically since i just created my
01:14 - account as an apple developer it took a
01:16 - few weeks for them to
01:19 - approve my account
01:21 - after they approved my account it really
01:23 - only took them a day to review the app
01:26 - and what they said was they can't test
01:28 - all the functionality of the app
01:30 - because they don't have an account to
01:32 - log in with now they also don't have the
01:35 - device
01:36 - so what we're going to do is we're going
01:38 - to create a demo account
01:43 - so this is exactly what they suggested
01:46 - it says please be sure
01:49 - it says please provide a username and
01:51 - password in the app store review so
01:53 - we're going to provide the username and
01:54 - password
01:55 - please be sure that the demo account
01:57 - includes content that demonstrates the
01:59 - features and functionality available in
02:01 - your app
02:02 - okay so
02:06 - we're going to
02:09 - do a check now
02:10 - whenever somebody logs in if they log in
02:13 - with certain information
02:16 - we're going to bypass everything that
02:17 - the app does and we're just going to
02:20 - kind of show
02:22 - like random data
02:24 - basically we're going to kind of mock
02:27 - the data that would normally come in
02:29 - without having to have the brain
02:32 - computer interface
02:33 - or it connected to any type of api
02:37 - just so that whoever is testing this for
02:39 - apple
02:40 - when they log in with the info we give
02:42 - them
02:43 - it shows them what the app would look
02:45 - like if they actually did have a notion
02:48 - brain computer
02:50 - connected to the device
02:52 - so that's the plan
02:56 - we'll see how long it takes i think we
02:58 - can get it done and resubmitted in
03:00 - about an hour i'm hoping
03:03 - we'll see how it goes
03:05 - i'm going to answer some questions if
03:07 - you have questions put them in the live
03:08 - chat
03:09 - i'll
03:10 - i'm going to set a timer
03:12 - and
03:13 - we're going to spend about 25 minutes on
03:15 - the code
03:16 - and then
03:19 - we will do about five minutes of
03:21 - question and answer
03:23 - and then we'll do another code session
03:24 - and then at the end we'll do some more
03:25 - question and answer
03:28 - i also want to release this
03:30 - as a web app maybe on github pages or
03:32 - something like that
03:34 - i don't think we'll have time for that
03:35 - on this stream so if we don't get to it
03:37 - this stream it'll probably be the next
03:38 - stream but that's also
03:40 - uh
03:42 - in
03:43 - in the plans uh to happen and there's a
03:46 - few other features that i'd like to add
03:48 - at some point but first thing is just
03:50 - get it released
03:51 - uh to
03:53 - basically the three platforms web
03:55 - apple and
03:56 - android
03:59 - so my timer is set
04:02 - and
04:04 - let's get to the code
04:06 - we can see the app here i'm going to
04:08 - shrink this up since we really don't
04:10 - need much in terms of uh ui space here
04:14 - and so we can focus on the code let me
04:16 - know if the code is too small
04:19 - is it it's two okay
04:22 - let me did say the code is too small
04:25 - i'm gonna bring it out
04:27 - a little bit if i get much bigger than
04:29 - this i'm not going to have any room to
04:31 - uh to actually code
04:33 - so
04:38 - let's look at where we're
04:40 - kind of like the first step in logging
04:42 - in
04:47 - and
04:49 - if the user let's see what gets called
04:54 - oops
04:56 - so our submit button here
04:59 - calls the init function so let's check
05:01 - out our init function here we go
05:05 - so this is where i want to check to see
05:08 - what the uh the id
05:10 - email and password are
05:12 - so let's say this uh if
05:23 - device id
05:25 - and we're going to say equals
05:28 - test
05:30 - i'm not even going to worry about
05:32 - username and password and all that stuff
05:34 - now
05:36 - let's just say if device id equals test
05:39 - then
05:43 - we will
05:48 - let's just
05:51 - init demo
05:53 - so we're gonna have to create init demo
06:02 - all right so a knit demo
06:07 - is going to be
06:09 - as i said a bypass
06:11 - of all of our authentication
06:14 - and
06:15 - connecting up to an api
06:17 - so
06:21 - this will be
06:24 - let's see
06:27 - this is gonna be interesting
06:31 - how we're gonna get this let's check our
06:33 - state because that's where everything
06:34 - goes through so we have our focus
06:37 - the main thing we need to do is focus
06:39 - and
06:44 - i got to remember what takes us to the
06:46 - next screen
06:48 - uh so our focus
06:50 - is gonna set let's just let's
06:52 - let's try that first
06:55 - uh let's check the screen first because
06:56 - i want something visible to show
07:00 - uh right away like what's going on with
07:02 - the screen so
07:04 - okay it looks like user
07:07 - so if user exists
07:09 - then that's what we do so what we'll do
07:11 - is we'll just set user
07:13 - i don't think i have typescript on i
07:15 - don't have any types yet on anything
07:17 - which is actually going to be
07:20 - good for now
07:22 - even though this is a tsx file for
07:24 - typescript i didn't add types to
07:25 - anything
07:26 - yet so
07:29 - i don't have to worry about that for now
07:31 - so init demo is going to set user
07:38 - to
07:39 - true
07:40 - setting user to true should take us to
07:43 - the next screen
07:44 - okay now hopefully it won't cause
07:48 - a bunch of errors and issues because
07:50 - that's definitely like user's not
07:52 - supposed to be a boolean right but
07:55 - let's just see what happens for now
07:57 - set user to true and then we're going to
07:59 - do set focus well let's do this let's do
08:02 - a timeout is that how we want to do it
08:14 - i wonder if we should do
08:22 - all right here's what i'm thinking
08:25 - i'd like to just like replay
08:27 - all the
08:30 - like the data that we would be getting
08:32 - in like over and over again
08:34 - um
08:36 - but
08:44 - i'm not sure the best way to do that
08:50 - maybe
08:53 - i mean we could do
08:54 - like set timeouts
09:00 - let's see if there's something like that
09:02 - uh
09:07 - let's see
09:11 - javascript
09:18 - timeout
09:22 - javascript timing events that's kind of
09:24 - what i want
09:33 - let's go to uh
09:35 - mdn
09:36 - i like that better
09:51 - okay i want to see the uh related
09:54 - time uh
09:56 - set interval
09:57 - this might be what i want more okay
10:00 - the set interval method
10:02 - offered on the window repeatedly calls a
10:05 - function or execute code that's what we
10:06 - want with a fixed time delay between
10:08 - each call all right cool that's what we
10:10 - want
10:11 - uh set interval
10:13 - so let's grab the example code and then
10:15 - just adapt it
10:17 - to what we have here so
10:25 - interesting
10:32 - i don't think we need all those
10:33 - parameters though
10:40 - did this problem okay
10:48 - okay interesting
11:00 - all right i don't think we need anything
11:02 - extra we can just pop this in here
11:05 - so
11:09 - let's try this and we'll go with a set
11:12 - interval
11:14 - and
11:16 - inside our set interval
11:18 - we'll do
11:18 - [Music]
11:25 - see if we can do this with like an arrow
11:27 - function
11:32 - and
11:33 - [Music]
11:35 - our our second uh parameter
11:38 - for our set interval our first parameter
11:40 - parameter is going to be this function
11:41 - right this arrow function which we'll do
11:43 - in a second
11:44 - uh but our timing is going to be
11:47 - let's give it a timing of like one
11:49 - second right so if this millisecond so a
11:51 - thousand milliseconds is one second now
11:54 - inside of here what i want to do is
11:57 - i want to set focus
11:59 - now focus is going to be a number
12:02 - between
12:03 - 0 and 1.
12:05 - so i want to set the focus to
12:10 - um
12:11 - to do like a random number
12:14 - um
12:16 - i don't exactly remember that syntax
12:25 - random number there we go
12:28 - math there we go math.random
12:30 - let's check out in the end i believe
12:32 - this will automatically be between zero
12:35 - and one yep cool
12:36 - that's exactly what we want
12:38 - math
12:39 - dot random
12:44 - cool
12:45 - and
12:51 - so then that should mean that at the set
12:53 - interval
12:55 - it'll be
12:57 - every
12:58 - one second it will set a different
13:00 - random number
13:02 - for our focus
13:05 - and that is going to
13:07 - imitate
13:08 - data coming in from the api
13:12 - setting our focus
13:13 - so let's try this out i have this
13:15 - running in the web right now
13:20 - so let's let's do
13:22 - test and submit
13:24 - sweet
13:30 - ah it works
13:32 - cool
13:38 - awesome
13:39 - all right that's pretty cool that works
13:41 - let's make sure i can log out
13:43 - and good it's not
13:45 - blinking
13:46 - i want to make sure that that interval
13:48 - is is actually not still running so
13:52 - i want to inspect this
13:54 - and see where our
13:58 - reacts and
14:03 - where's our
14:04 - states
14:16 - oh you probably can't see any of this
14:17 - let me make it bigger whoa
14:19 - just a little bigger
14:25 - uh app there we go
14:27 - oh you know what that still is going so
14:29 - we need a way to stop our interval
14:32 - let's check this again
14:34 - how do we stop the interval
14:37 - clear interval
14:39 - set interval and set time it's just same
14:41 - pool id in a clear interval clear time
14:43 - activity oops
14:59 - all right let's see if i can just run
15:01 - clear interval to stop this
15:17 - nope that does not work there
15:19 - i might have to actually name this
15:22 - uh
15:25 - see how they name this here
15:34 - the return interval id oh okay is a
15:37 - non-zero value which identifies the
15:38 - timer created
15:42 - interesting so there is a return value
15:45 - from set interval
15:48 - so
15:49 - we should be able to set the interval id
15:56 - by this wonder if you could do
16:00 - actually
16:13 - we're gonna make another
16:16 - part of the state here right
16:19 - and
16:26 - this should be
16:47 - let me set interval id to null at first
16:52 - and then what we'll do is
16:54 - in our log out let's see
16:58 - in our log out function
17:01 - we're gonna go set
17:05 - interval id
17:07 - oops
17:14 - send interval id
17:15 - and we're going to add
17:19 - oops i'm sorry that's not what i meant
17:21 - we're going to say clear interval
17:27 - and we're going to say interval
17:30 - id
17:31 - so that should clear the interval for us
17:34 - hopefully
17:36 - see if that works
17:41 - just pull that out so first let's verify
17:43 - that
17:45 - okay so we don't we don't have the um
17:52 - let's make sure in the right one there
17:53 - we go
17:55 - all right so nothing's changing in our
17:57 - in our state here you see the values are
17:59 - staying the same let's submit you can
18:02 - see now we do have our state changing
18:04 - let's hit log out
18:06 - and now that we've logged out it is
18:08 - stopped
18:10 - so our interval stopped
18:13 - our our focus has stopped not only that
18:14 - but you know what let's let's clear our
18:16 - focus
18:17 - so once we clear the interval let's uh
18:20 - set focus
18:23 - to
18:24 - what's our
18:25 - default for focus let's check this out
18:28 - focus
18:29 - is zero
18:32 - so i guess let's just set it back down
18:34 - to zero
18:35 - just to reset everything to how it
18:38 - normally is
18:45 - all right let's test that one more time
18:48 - test
18:51 - log out wonderful
18:53 - oh no not so wonderful right because
18:55 - what it's it took us back down to zero
18:59 - all right we don't want that
19:03 - and we set the user the user is set back
19:06 - to null
19:08 - why are we still back down to
19:10 - let's see
19:12 - see where our color's coming from
19:13 - background color
19:19 - uh
19:21 - okay
19:22 - where are we setting our background
19:23 - color
19:31 - when our focus changes that's what's
19:33 - happening
19:34 - but really it should be a focus or user
19:37 - changes correct
19:39 - and then we're going to say
19:44 - let's try that let's see if that fixes
19:46 - our issue
19:48 - issue being that that turned red
19:53 - now you would have kept it red
19:55 - i don't like that
20:00 - let's make sure
20:03 - so we should still why is that still red
20:07 - well
20:08 - we could what we could do
20:11 - i think i'm still going to keep that
20:13 - because that makes sense but what we
20:14 - could also do is on log out we could set
20:17 - background
20:19 - set background color
20:22 - to um
20:25 - white so fff would be white
20:28 - let's see if that does what we want
20:32 - great that works
20:34 - okay
20:37 - all right that solves our problem so now
20:40 - when we log out it takes us back to
20:43 - basically the
20:44 - the state we're actually getting a lot
20:46 - of state here so at some point i might
20:48 - refactor this so we don't have a ton of
20:50 - view states uh perhaps maybe change that
20:53 - up to a user reducer
20:55 - i don't really mind that using state
20:57 - like this
20:59 - but
21:01 - i don't know when it starts getting a
21:02 - little bit bigger then i start to think
21:04 - maybe it's
21:05 - maybe we need some sort of um
21:08 - uh
21:10 - different system to manage all the state
21:12 - but right now it's not too bad
21:16 - all right i definitely want to do a test
21:18 - of
21:19 - the actual functionality
21:21 - just to make sure
21:23 - uh that this works still so i'm going to
21:26 - grab my device
21:27 - id
21:28 - actually see
21:30 - looks like i might have this saved
21:33 - no i don't
21:34 - logos one two three four nah
21:37 - that's not the right one
21:41 - yeah i don't think that's the right one
21:42 - okay let me grab my real device id
21:49 - and the uh password
21:55 - actually i'll need to turn my device on
21:59 - just want to make sure now what we've
22:00 - done shouldn't mess up anything else for
22:02 - how the app really works
22:05 - but
22:06 - just in case i want to want to test it
22:09 - we've got about
22:10 - about six minutes left on the timer
22:12 - before i'm gonna take a break and go to
22:14 - the chat
22:15 - so um if i
22:18 - uh if you've asked a question in the
22:19 - chat hang in there for a couple more
22:21 - minutes and uh and i'll get to it
22:26 - uh here's my device id
22:29 - whoa
22:31 - interesting interesting
22:48 - hmm
22:56 - try that again
23:06 - why are we getting that
23:10 - i wonder
23:19 - hmm
23:26 - that's no good
23:33 - i wonder if just
23:38 - that's odd
23:40 - huh
23:41 - that's really weird
23:47 - i wonder what i was actually trying to
23:49 - paste in there
23:53 - maybe i'd
23:55 - maybe i just didn't realize what i had
23:58 - pasted in there maybe i was pasting
23:59 - something in but that's actually not not
24:01 - bad to do
24:03 - essentially depending on what you type
24:04 - in there that could really mess up
24:07 - the
24:09 - the app it could crash the app so often
24:12 - worked out as a bug
24:17 - and the password
24:19 - password
24:23 - i believe
24:25 - this is the password
24:30 - nice we can add that
24:35 - cool so it looks like that works i don't
24:37 - really have the device on it's just kind
24:39 - of sending this is the device it's just
24:41 - sending like random signals at this
24:43 - point uh but we know it works let's log
24:46 - out awesome
24:50 - cool everything looks like it works now
24:53 - right before the stream started i did go
24:55 - into the app.json and i uh said that
24:58 - this is build number 1.0.1
25:02 - and um
25:04 - version code for android i guess we'll
25:06 - stick with the same
25:09 - can i do that for android
25:12 - expect to come
25:14 - maybe at once
25:26 - i wonder if it'll let me do that for
25:27 - android we're not going to build the
25:28 - android right now
25:29 - um but
25:31 - i'd like to keep these the same
25:33 - if i can
25:36 - uh i know before android didn't like
25:38 - that i tried to submit
25:41 - an update to the app
25:43 - with it the same version code so that's
25:45 - why i'm incrementing that i don't know
25:47 - if ios is like that but rather
25:51 - rather not mess with it
25:54 - and mess it up you know
25:56 - okay version 1.0.1 we'll just increment
26:00 - that
26:02 - cool
26:05 - now
26:05 - [Music]
26:09 - let's uh
26:12 - we get status see what changed that
26:14 - looks about right get add
26:17 - git commit
26:19 - and
26:20 - we'll put a message in there and
26:22 - we'll say
26:25 - we added a feature and it's gonna be add
26:28 - demo mode
26:31 - awesome
26:36 - now let's push it get push
26:39 - origin
26:41 - actually i'm on the master branch i can
26:42 - just get push
26:44 - cool
26:45 - normally it's it's pretty good idea to
26:48 - do any updates on separate branches and
26:50 - then do a pull request but since
26:52 - this is a solo project i'm the only
26:54 - working on it
26:55 - i'm just pushing the master
26:57 - if this was a real project
26:59 - then i probably wouldn't be doing it
27:01 - like that like when i'm at work you
27:03 - don't ever push directly to master so
27:05 - it's always on a separate branch
27:09 - all right so that's
27:11 - in now and let's actually let's go to
27:13 - github
27:17 - stay focused
27:22 - i want to add an issue
27:27 - i believe the issue is
27:32 - titled
27:54 - all right
28:21 - okay
28:22 - i think that was the issue that the app
28:24 - was crashing i just want to add it
28:28 - just so i don't forget
28:30 - that's not like the best reproduction
28:32 - steps like ideally i would have said
28:34 - exactly what to type in there so you
28:36 - know if we have time later on we can try
28:39 - to reproduce it and um
28:41 - maybe fix that or or add it in but
28:44 - anyway
28:45 - i don't want to forget it so we added it
28:47 - in
28:49 - now let's go to at the app store
28:52 - and
28:56 - oops you know what i need to do we need
28:58 - to actually make a a build right
29:00 - uh let's check on expo
29:03 - let's see if there's a way for me to
29:04 - update this app
29:12 - so
29:14 - let's see how we can do these updates
29:16 - because i might not have to actually um
29:19 - manually move the file
29:22 - let's see
29:25 - actually my timer just went off so i'm
29:27 - going to take a five minute break and
29:29 - answer some questions and when we come
29:31 - back then we're going to upload the
29:33 - update
29:34 - where we figure out what the best way is
29:36 - to update it and then we're actually
29:38 - going to update
29:39 - what's in the
29:41 - uh the app store
29:43 - currently
29:45 - so i'm setting a five minute timer
29:47 - and let's go over here and read some of
29:49 - these comments
29:53 - i'm just growing up to the top and going
29:55 - in order here
29:56 - um
29:58 - you brian says is typescript included in
30:00 - this project yes yes it is i'm not
30:03 - using it
30:04 - throughout
30:06 - everything yet
30:07 - but it's there
30:08 - mainly i'm not using it just because
30:10 - i'm
30:12 - trying to kind of go as fast as i can
30:14 - for the live stream
30:15 - and
30:18 - especially when
30:20 - when a lot of the code that i was using
30:22 - it was kind of testing and not even sure
30:24 - if it was working uh i kind of didn't
30:26 - bother to put types in
30:29 - now that things are actually working
30:30 - though might not be a bad idea to start
30:32 - adding in types as we go
30:35 - someone asked if this was ruby it is not
30:37 - ruby is javascript uh specifically it is
30:40 - react native
30:41 - which is a javascript library
30:45 - um
30:47 - suleiman says what is the font family
30:50 - you're using on vs code
30:52 - uh i'm not even sure what font family
30:55 - i'm using
30:57 - let's see if i get checked
31:01 - um preferences
31:08 - see my settings here
31:12 - text editor
31:13 - font size
31:14 - my font family
31:16 - is
31:21 - c-o-n-s-o-l-a-s
31:25 - which i was not aware of
31:27 - that must be the default that comes with
31:29 - it
31:36 - youtube's greece says programmer or
31:39 - technician
31:41 - to tell the truth i don't really know
31:42 - the difference
31:44 - what do you mean what what do you mean
31:47 - by programmer and technician and maybe
31:49 - i'll be able to answer that better
32:00 - uh farhad asks if the previous parts are
32:03 - on free code camp yes they are so just
32:05 - check out
32:06 - all the um
32:08 - brain computer it's build a brain
32:10 - computer app with react native
32:12 - this is part seven all the other parts
32:14 - are there except for part two part two
32:16 - uh i
32:18 - accidentally deleted so i'm gonna redo
32:21 - part two at some point
32:23 - so that that will be there i do plan on
32:25 - redoing that but for now part two is not
32:27 - available
32:31 - uh and andika says why react native
32:36 - um
32:37 - well i use react native at my job
32:39 - so
32:40 - it just it's very easy for me to build
32:42 - with react native
32:44 - uh react native allows me to build for
32:47 - ios android and web
32:49 - all with the same code base
32:51 - so it's definitely a good choice uh if
32:53 - you're working on a project by yourself
32:55 - like i am with this project
32:58 - because
33:02 - otherwise
33:04 - you would need
33:05 - such a broad array of knowledge
33:10 - a knowledge of like let's say if i were
33:13 - to build for all those platforms
33:14 - natively on those platforms i'll
33:17 - it would be too much to remember there's
33:19 - no way i could be an expert at any one
33:21 - right
33:22 - but react native helps you to build to
33:24 - become
33:26 - proficient in building for
33:28 - uh all three so anyway that's why i
33:30 - decided to use it
33:36 - uh guri says i am new at developing and
33:38 - i want to know uh can i connect
33:40 - javascript with a database like mysql
33:43 - uh yeah you definitely can you probably
33:45 - want to use
33:47 - an api
33:49 - um
33:50 - you could like potentially you could use
33:52 - node.js to run on a server and connect
33:55 - with my sql
33:56 - um i it's i guess it's possible to
33:59 - connect from the front end to my sequel
34:01 - although i've never done it or seen it
34:04 - but
34:05 - normally you would
34:08 - if we're talking front-end javascript
34:09 - running like in a browser
34:11 - normally you would want to expose some
34:13 - sort of api the api layer would
34:16 - connect to the database
34:18 - and then
34:19 - so nothing but the api would directly
34:21 - connect to the database
34:39 - okay
34:42 - just i'm scrolling down looking for more
34:44 - questions
34:54 - uh last question
34:56 - before i go back to the code
34:58 - um
35:03 - this says
35:06 - uh cir circon says
35:09 - by the way how is your quarantine
35:12 - um
35:13 - actually you know what the last week was
35:16 - was really good uh to be honest with you
35:18 - i'd
35:19 - um
35:20 - it it's been a little bit rough like my
35:22 - family is doing all right all my kids
35:24 - are home from school
35:26 - uh my wife lost her job uh but we're
35:30 - doing all right um
35:33 - i um
35:35 - i was kind of like depressed
35:38 - for a couple weeks into this but the
35:40 - last week i've been feeling pretty good
35:42 - um
35:43 - and the whole family was doing
35:45 - you know doing pretty good so
35:47 - you know right now i think we're all
35:49 - just kind of getting used to it at this
35:50 - point
35:52 - but uh anyway how's everything going for
35:54 - you let me know in the chat uh or in the
35:56 - comments like how's quarantine going for
35:58 - you all i know it's probably different
36:00 - in different areas of the world i'm in
36:02 - the united states in in ohio
36:05 - um every state in the united states
36:07 - seems to have different rules right now
36:09 - in terms of like what businesses can
36:11 - stay open and where you're allowed to go
36:13 - uh so for me it's pretty much everything
36:16 - is shut down like hospitals are still
36:18 - open
36:19 - um restaurants are allowed to stay open
36:22 - but no one can go in them so you you can
36:24 - just um like get food delivered
36:28 - grocery stores are allowed to stay open
36:31 - but like all the schools are closed
36:34 - and most other types of businesses are
36:36 - closed
36:37 - so
36:38 - that's where it's at right now uh for me
36:41 - i'm
36:42 - i'm still working uh even though like my
36:44 - company basically shut down almost all
36:46 - their stores
36:47 - uh i'm
36:50 - thankfully still
36:51 - uh still have a job uh so
36:55 - that's good so i think i'm doing you
36:57 - know better a lot of people don't have
36:58 - jobs anymore um but for me i'm you know
37:02 - thankful to be able to keep keep working
37:04 - and you know keep supporting my family
37:06 - but hopefully everything's going all
37:08 - right for you all too
37:10 - let me
37:11 - let me go back now i know i didn't get
37:13 - to all the questions i'll get back to
37:15 - them though
37:16 - but i want to make sure we get this
37:18 - you know submitted and so far
37:19 - everything's been going pretty smoothly
37:21 - which is kind of crazy usually like
37:23 - something
37:24 - there's some issues so i'm expecting the
37:27 - issues will happen here in the second
37:29 - part of the stream here
37:31 - but let's read this
37:33 - just really quick
37:34 - to see if we want to use this way
37:37 - to update
37:40 - let's see
37:42 - so these are over there updates allow
37:43 - you to publish a new version of your app
37:46 - without building a new version of your
37:48 - standalone app and resubmit resubmitting
37:50 - that's awesome that's definitely what
37:52 - what i want to perform an over-the-air
37:54 - update of the app you simply run expo
37:56 - publish
38:01 - all right i don't think we have released
38:03 - channels so we don't have to do that
38:11 - and we didn't change the sdk version
38:14 - so we don't need to build
38:18 - the update setting in app.json
38:23 - all right let's let's check out the
38:24 - update setting in app.json
38:30 - do because we might need to set it to
38:33 - true
38:37 - all right let's let's check out our
38:38 - update setting because i don't i don't
38:40 - remember if we have this set or not
38:44 - updates
38:45 - so we have a fallback to
38:48 - we have that timeout one
38:53 - if it's set to false channel i would
38:55 - never download any code only just kill
38:57 - one device in that case
38:59 - of the chest we should have preview it
39:01 - defaults to true okay so it it should be
39:04 - uh enabled
39:06 - well let's try it let's run what did
39:07 - they say
39:08 - let's run expo publish
39:11 - and then we can check
39:13 - to see if it uh
39:15 - if it worked
39:18 - cool
39:19 - hey this might end up being
39:21 - you know pretty easy so we'll go back
39:23 - here to our code
39:25 - and
39:27 - let's pull up our terminal which i did i
39:29 - just closed can i grab it from here nice
39:32 - it's still there okay cool
39:35 - so
39:38 - let's run
39:40 - expo publish
39:49 - oops
39:50 - validating fields not json
39:55 - okay we changed that android version it
39:57 - has to be an integer
39:59 - all right cool
40:01 - so
40:01 - i wasn't sure about that
40:06 - let's change this back whoops this one
40:08 - needs to be an integer so it was an
40:10 - integer we changed it to a string so
40:11 - let's just say version two then
40:15 - and
40:20 - we'll save that
40:43 - all right i just did a little
40:45 - committed the changes and get just so i
40:47 - didn't forget
40:49 - sometimes especially when i'm streaming
40:50 - i'll forget to update my changes so
40:53 - i want to make sure i do that all right
40:55 - now let's do our
40:59 - expo publish again and see if it works
41:07 - we should know if it worked
41:10 - in the app store because we'll see
41:13 - a new version number
41:19 - so so far looks like it's building
41:21 - building an ios bundle that's awesome
41:24 - you know while it's doing its thing
41:26 - let's go into our
41:28 - app store
41:30 - and let's add in
41:35 - user access maybe that's it
41:38 - we'll cancel now we want
41:42 - we gotta change
41:47 - maybe i'll go back in here because it
41:48 - says where to go to do this
41:54 - rejected
41:57 - actually i think it is on this page
41:59 - build
42:02 - app review sign in required
42:12 - that's not what i want i want
42:14 - additional information
42:17 - notes
42:18 - okay
42:21 - let's see
42:53 - all right so this will give
42:56 - hopefully they don't require me to to um
43:00 - enter in these fields because they're
43:01 - going to be blank
43:04 - but now at least they should
43:09 - the apps
43:11 - demo mode
43:23 - so i'm going to say demo mode does not
43:25 - require
43:26 - the use of the
43:34 - no c notion brain computer okay
44:05 - all right cool
44:09 - version
44:13 - actually
44:15 - i'm gonna copy and paste this because i
44:16 - wonder if uh
44:22 - if this will change
44:28 - and we have to change the app version
44:30 - let's let's check on the progress here
44:32 - of our
44:35 - or update
44:36 - all right cool
44:38 - so it says publishing of default
44:40 - building ios change skips
44:57 - hmm
45:05 - let's open this up oops
45:08 - uh it cut off the uh the url
45:11 - oh well let's go to app store now and
45:13 - see
45:20 - activity
45:28 - hmm
45:30 - let me go to expo
45:36 - go to my exo dashboard and see what's
45:37 - going on there
45:40 - review builds
45:47 - hmm
45:55 - i wonder what happened
45:57 - let's get rid of some of this stuff we
45:59 - don't need
46:00 - um
46:02 - that's very weird
46:17 - does it just seems like there's no um
46:32 - all right let me
46:34 - let me paste this here so i don't lose
46:36 - it
46:37 - and then
46:45 - let's try to go here
47:00 - hmm
47:36 - well i kind of think we should just do a
47:38 - new build let me double check in the app
47:40 - store
47:42 - um
47:44 - let me see this one unresolved issue
48:07 - i just wonder
48:14 - all right if anybody's done anything
48:16 - like this before with expo let me know
48:20 - what i'm not sure about is
48:23 - would
48:25 - like how does this update get yet up hit
48:27 - to here right is it um
48:34 - is it somehow pulling in the
48:37 - the updated javascript
48:40 - uh
48:41 - i'm very
48:43 - i'm i'm really not sure
48:46 - so here's the initial upload so it's on
48:49 - upload
49:02 - interesting
49:03 - well you know what i guess i could test
49:04 - this um
49:07 - i could probably test this on my phone
49:08 - because i have the stay focused app the
49:11 - android version so if i can type in
49:14 - test
49:26 - all right so definitely does not work on
49:28 - my android version so
49:31 - i'm guessing that the update did not
49:33 - work
49:35 - oh yeah it did
49:37 - i just had to refresh the app so
49:44 - i guess it worked
49:45 - that's insane
49:47 - i can't believe that
49:51 - wow
49:53 - okay cool so
49:55 - i just went to
49:57 - my android app
49:59 - and i have so this has already been
50:01 - released to android right um
50:04 - the demo mode was not released to
50:06 - android right we just coded it
50:08 - right here we did the update
50:10 - i didn't have to resubmit anything
50:13 - but all i did was i went in i like
50:16 - manually shut down the app right in
50:18 - android and then opened it back up it re
50:21 - it evidently loaded the new javascript
50:24 - it took like less than a second i typed
50:26 - in test
50:27 - and it the demo mode worked so i think
50:31 - i don't need
50:34 - to do anything here
50:36 - i think like i've i've updated
50:40 - the app information
50:45 - so let's double check to make sure
50:46 - that's still in there yep cool
50:49 - so that's there
50:51 - so i think this should work
50:54 - and
50:57 - we'll submit that
50:58 - and then it says respond oh there's an
51:01 - error one more errors on the page
51:04 - i guess i don't need
51:06 - let me just yeah we'll uh i'll just
51:09 - click that off of there and then that
51:11 - way
51:13 - ensure that you select the correct
51:15 - answer for advertising number
51:18 - you just like no the binary will be
51:20 - permanently rejected you know submit to
51:21 - different but different matter
51:26 - ah
51:28 - let's see
51:30 - i believe i need to use this right
51:33 - and we did this
51:39 - all right we we did this on our last
51:42 - live stream
51:44 - where
51:46 - when did we do this
51:49 - um
51:51 - i'm just gonna go to the other live
51:53 - stream this is gonna be like the most
51:54 - meta thing that i've ever done
52:08 - all right so let's go to numbers
52:11 - part six
52:15 - and let's figure out
52:17 - where we entered that stuff in
52:21 - all right so here's we're entering in
52:23 - data
52:26 - i'll make this bigger just so that i can
52:28 - read what it is
52:34 - all right back
52:53 - all right this is still
52:55 - where is this
53:01 - um
53:20 - all right this is still building
53:22 - everything
53:27 - trying to look through the bottom here
53:28 - to see
53:36 - see what we're typing in
53:44 - i remember what this screen looks like
53:46 - all right so i'm looking for a screen
53:47 - that looks like this with check boxes
53:58 - let's do uh
54:01 - playback speed
54:03 - double
54:08 - and then i'll also look for check boxes
54:12 - on the screen
54:39 - cool
54:47 - i thought this would be faster than
54:48 - going back through the expo
54:50 - documentation to find where it talks
54:52 - about this but
54:54 - it's possible this will not be faster
55:10 - all right that's where i'm chatting so
55:12 - skip that
55:17 - i think the end of the video is oh wait
55:20 - is this it
55:23 - i think this might be it
55:27 - might be around here
55:45 - you're at least just going to tell me
55:46 - where i get the answers
56:12 - this is the same thing i was looking for
56:14 - in the last stream trying to find the
56:16 - answer to
56:39 - i can't find exactly where it is shoot
56:41 - all right
56:42 - i'm gonna have to go through the uh
56:45 - expo documentation
56:47 - let's see if i can
56:51 - search for this
56:52 - maybe a google search or help
57:01 - yes
57:02 - all right
57:16 - all right
57:18 - google search to the rescue i'm gonna
57:20 - throw this on my other screen real quick
57:22 - and then so we can fill this out again
57:24 - so
57:26 - i don't want to mess this up because
57:27 - this is like legal stuff and will
57:29 - definitely could determine whether or
57:30 - not my app gets um
57:33 - accepted or not so that's why it took so
57:35 - long to find it this is a necessary
57:38 - thing
57:39 - all right so attribute tribute to this
57:41 - app installation to previously served
57:43 - advertisement
57:44 - check the following boxes so i need to
57:46 - check
57:48 - yes
57:50 - tribute and action taken with this app
57:51 - is proof
57:56 - all right these three
57:59 - there we go
58:09 - very cool and
58:10 - [Music]
58:16 - see if it'll let me change the version

59:53 - i'm going to check my gmail on my other
59:54 - screen and
59:59 - see if
60:02 - if i can reply to the email
60:15 - no i it doesn't it doesn't say to reply
60:18 - and when i go click to go to the
60:20 - resolution center it just brings me
60:21 - right back to here
60:23 - the only thing i can think of i mean let
60:24 - me pull this back down to a hundred
60:26 - percent
60:27 - maybe some part of the ui is
60:31 - not here
60:33 - oops
60:34 - it doesn't look like it though
60:40 - i guess it's worth um
60:43 - we're searching how to reply
60:48 - message in the app
60:54 - store resolution center
61:01 - there you go
61:04 - what the heck is this
61:11 - enter a username
61:13 - why
61:14 - i'm already logged in
61:39 - all right
61:49 - are you serious
61:50 - i just want to read this thing
61:53 - all right
62:04 - stack overflow there we go
62:32 - i don't think that exactly
62:34 - what's the answer
63:01 - yeah i guess i'm just gonna have to go
63:03 - ahead and
63:04 - submit let's see
63:08 - let's just check that
63:11 - our username is okay
63:13 - all right
63:14 - submit
63:17 - waiting to be confirmed uh come on
63:37 - that's really crazy
63:39 - but i can't
63:41 - i can't actually see
63:45 - my stuff
63:54 - yes alright finally
63:59 - that's pretty wild so you can't even see
64:01 - the developer forums no i did not mean
64:04 - to click on that
64:17 - you can respond to active resolution
64:19 - center issues for your apps by tapping
64:22 - on the alert banner within itunes
64:24 - connect for ios
64:34 - hmm
64:40 - if you make any changes you lose the
64:42 - ability to reply
64:59 - hmm
65:04 - okay so it seems like the itunes connect
65:07 - ios app has a reply button
65:10 - which i don't
65:11 - have an
65:12 - ios device right now so that's not going
65:15 - to work
65:24 - all right interesting
65:25 - so there's no reply button although i'm
65:28 - not
65:29 - i guess it will be fine
65:34 - because
65:40 - like it says
65:42 - i mean it says waiting for review now
65:44 - they should be notified that something
65:46 - was updated
65:56 - so
65:57 - i i'm gonna say
65:59 - i'll just wait and see i'll wait a
66:00 - couple days see if they say anything if
66:03 - not
66:04 - i can go through support i guess
66:06 - but uh for now i'm gonna try to answer
66:09 - as many questions as i can i gotta get
66:12 - help get the kids ready for bed here in
66:14 - a few minutes so
66:15 - i can't answer a ton of questions but
66:18 - i'll see what i can do
66:19 - um anyway i mean we basically succeeded
66:22 - in
66:23 - doing what we you know set out to do for
66:25 - this stream so i'm happy about that we
66:28 - should find out in a few days whether or
66:29 - not this you know gets successfully
66:32 - added to the app store which is pretty
66:34 - sweet i know there are some people that
66:35 - used
66:36 - um
66:40 - they use the
66:43 - they use ios devices so they couldn't
66:45 - test the app so now they will be able to
66:48 - and then maybe on the next stream
66:50 - hopefully if this gets submitted the
66:51 - next stream we can do the web app
66:52 - version and then anybody can try it out
66:55 - as long as they can
66:56 - get on a browser and
66:59 - if they have one of the headsets
67:03 - all right
67:10 - uh you ukulele daca says what does tsx
67:15 - mean
67:15 - um it's typescript
67:17 - particularly it's typescript with
67:20 - uh
67:21 - reacts jsx syntax
67:25 - that's that syntax that kind of looks
67:27 - like html but it's really not so
67:31 - uh this kind of stuff here let me show
67:33 - you so like this kind of stuff here
67:35 - where you have like the angle brackets
67:37 - that it looks kind of like html that's
67:39 - called jsx
67:41 - so
67:42 - if you want to use typescript
67:44 - with jsx you give it the tsx extension
67:55 - hum zita asks what's typescript
67:57 - typescript is what's uh you would call
68:00 - it a superset of javascript so
68:03 - it
68:05 - adds additional features into javascript
68:08 - uh mostly what it adds are types to
68:11 - javascript so a javascript if if you
68:14 - want to know more about that i actually
68:15 - did a video on my youtube channel about
68:17 - that so there's a link in my description
68:20 - uh
68:21 - in the description to my youtube channel
68:24 - i did a video not that long ago
68:26 - it's like an intro to typescript so
68:29 - check out that video i go in depth a lot
68:31 - more into what typescript is but the
68:33 - short answer is it adds types to
68:35 - javascript
68:43 - social network snapogram says we love
68:45 - free code camp five stars thank you i
68:48 - appreciate it
69:06 - all right a couple of people were asking
69:07 - what this was and then some of you in
69:09 - the chat uh actually kind of explained
69:11 - it in the chat so i'm gonna skip over
69:13 - that for now thank you so much for
69:15 - um providing those those explanations
69:17 - for those of you that did
69:21 - uh cherry says hey love from brazil
69:24 - awesome thanks for for joining us
69:27 - i wonder what
69:29 - i'm not sure what time zones are in
69:30 - brazil if i brazil's pretty big so i'm
69:33 - assuming there's different time zones
69:34 - jerry if you're still on there what time
69:36 - is it in brazil right now i'm trying to
69:39 - think how that would line up if the
69:41 - eastern part of brazil would be the same
69:43 - time zone as me
69:44 - i don't know
69:58 - uh johnny says hi from columbia take
70:01 - care hey how's it going
70:06 - um
70:08 - micah
70:09 - micah i believe is how you pronounce
70:11 - that is says in helsinki finland
70:14 - restaurants are closed schools are
70:16 - closed
70:17 - um
70:19 - it says i only go to shop in the night
70:20 - time the economy is going down
70:22 - that's about it so earlier in the stream
70:25 - i'd asked i someone had asked me how the
70:28 - quarantine is going and i had kind of
70:30 - said what was going on here and i asked
70:31 - what was going on and the rest of the
70:33 - world uh so that's why
70:36 - uh micah responded with that but
70:39 - yeah the economy is
70:42 - that's kind of worrying uh that
70:45 - it seems like like i i mentioned earlier
70:48 - a lot of people have lost their jobs
70:49 - already in the united states
70:52 - and
70:53 - i'm assuming it's dissimilar around the
70:55 - world that's
70:57 - that's gonna be tough
70:58 - um i know like here the government's
71:01 - trying to just basically give people
71:03 - money to make sure they can still pay
71:04 - their bills and stuff but
71:06 - that's also gonna cause problems as well
71:08 - i'm sure there's gonna be inflation
71:10 - uh down the road because of that so
71:14 - it's hard to predict you know exactly
71:16 - what's gonna happen from all that but
71:18 - i'm sure it's it's probably gonna be
71:21 - it's gonna be a while before things
71:24 - you know get back to being stable uh in
71:26 - terms of like people having jobs and
71:28 - everything
71:35 - let's see
71:37 - there's a cool discussion about um
71:41 - different ways you can create apps uh
71:44 - specifically between like android
71:47 - using like native android or
71:49 - react native so
71:51 - check that out if you're if you're
71:53 - watching this um
71:55 - at this time like
71:58 - and you're interested in that maybe
71:59 - check out that chat in the live chat i'm
72:01 - not going to read it out because the
72:03 - chat gets saved so you all can check it
72:05 - out but there's some good stuff in there
72:10 - lauren says
72:11 - in hungary
72:12 - food stores are open
72:14 - elders are allowed out between 9 and 12
72:16 - to shop only
72:18 - hotels restaurants and parks are closed
72:21 - a lot of it jobs are available
72:23 - programmers
72:24 - senior programmers around three thousand
72:26 - dollars net
72:29 - what's good that there's jobs still
72:31 - available um i'd have noticed some of
72:33 - the stores around here have certain
72:35 - hours where
72:36 - older people can go
72:39 - since they're more susceptible to
72:40 - getting the virus so that's good
72:53 - cybertech security says you have good
72:54 - skill for programming thank you i
72:56 - appreciate it i would hope by now that
72:59 - i'm like
73:00 - starting to get a little bit better at
73:01 - programming i've been doing it for a
73:03 - long time so uh
73:06 - i can definitely make things work at
73:08 - this point
73:10 - mustafa asks what platform i'm using
73:13 - this is uh
73:14 - react native
73:16 - it's a javascript library
73:22 - and also so darren
73:24 - actually answered that question thanks
73:26 - darren i didn't see that until now but
73:27 - it says
73:29 - also said coding on vs code windows 10
73:31 - and deploying to ios
73:33 - that's awesome that's a better answer
73:34 - than i gave too
73:51 - okay wow it's uh

75:38 - how long does it take to learn
75:40 - javascript and what do you advise for
75:41 - learning it thanks beforehand um it's
75:44 - really hard to tell how long it'll take
75:46 - because it depends a lot on your
75:48 - situation
75:49 - but
75:51 - i would definitely recommend going to
75:52 - freecodecamp.org
75:54 - and checking out the javascript lessons
75:55 - there
75:57 - uh that's a great place to start after
75:59 - that
76:00 - maybe check out some youtube videos uh
76:03 - or you know some
76:06 - try to like maybe do some of your own
76:08 - projects and look at some documentation
76:10 - for javascript and different javascript
76:12 - libraries but to learn the basics and
76:14 - get started free code camp is one of the
76:16 - best places you can go to
76:19 - benedict says hello from malaysia it's 8
