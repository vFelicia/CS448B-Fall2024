00:00 - all right folks here it is day number 30
00:03 - of css3 in 30 days
00:06 - if you've made it this far and you've
00:08 - coded a project or learned a little bit
00:11 - about css3 each day for the last 30 days
00:15 - congratulate yourself pat yourself on
00:17 - the back
00:18 - go
00:19 - do something exciting celebrate because
00:22 - this was a big accomplishment for you
00:24 - and i want to congratulate you now with
00:26 - all the sweet talk aside we're going to
00:27 - build one last project it's going to be
00:29 - exciting
00:30 - and let me show you what that looks like
00:32 - right here so here in day number 30
00:35 - we're going to coat up
00:36 - a realistic looking illustration style
00:40 - css3
00:41 - coffee cup the markup is really easy
00:45 - four or five divs
00:47 - the rest of it is css3
00:50 - gradients and colors and shadows and
00:53 - transforms and positioning and all that
00:55 - sort of stuff to create this beauty
00:58 - right here
01:00 - look at that
01:01 - looks like a designer went and
01:04 - illustrated up a coffee cup in
01:07 - like illustrator or photoshop or
01:08 - something like that
01:09 - and we just plopped it on the screen but
01:12 - these are not images whatsoever it's not
01:15 - even an svg graphic this is straight up
01:17 - css
01:18 - three
01:20 - now just to show you what's going on we
01:23 - have the entire coffee cup right here so
01:25 - this circle is one element
01:28 - and we have a bunch of gradients going
01:30 - on to create this shadowed effect this
01:32 - bevel some highlights and then it gets
01:35 - darker as it goes deeper into the cup
01:37 - within here we have the actual coffee or
01:39 - the brew
01:40 - and this ring on the outside is the
01:43 - crema
01:44 - as a coffee
01:47 - snob i guess you could call me i
01:50 - i wanted to include this the crema is
01:52 - when you pull an espresso shot
01:55 - and there is that thick
01:57 - or thin layer of creamy
02:00 - coffee on the top it's this
02:02 - crema is what it is and it's a little
02:05 - bit bitter it's got a lot of flavor and
02:07 - it typically is a sign of a good
02:08 - espresso shot being pulled if you let it
02:11 - settle for a while the crema will settle
02:13 - around the edges revealing the coffee
02:15 - and under it so that is the outer ring
02:18 - of what is remaining of the crema
02:21 - this is a very subtle
02:24 - black
02:25 - to
02:26 - very very dark brown gradient going from
02:29 - top left to bottom right
02:31 - just to give it a little bit more depth
02:34 - because right here we have this ring
02:38 - this this light ring this reflection
02:41 - and that's as if the light were shining
02:43 - from the top right sorry the top left
02:45 - down that's why the coffee is darker
02:47 - here the shadow is being cast by the rim
02:49 - of the coffee cup
02:50 - and it gets a little bit lighter here as
02:52 - the as the light source reflects down
02:55 - into the cup
02:57 - and onto the coffee so there is this
02:59 - ring right here
03:00 - as that reflection giving it depth and a
03:03 - little bit of a gradient
03:05 - so those are the two elements there we
03:07 - have one more element right here and
03:08 - it's just simply a handle
03:10 - just to hold your coffee
03:13 - so let's jump into our code editor and
03:15 - see how simple or maybe difficult it is
03:18 - to come up with this sort of css3 all
03:21 - right over here in my code editor we
03:23 - have day number 30 css3 coffee go ahead
03:26 - and download that and fire it up in your
03:27 - code editor of choice we have the index
03:30 - sandbox and final of course final is
03:32 - there for your reference if you have any
03:35 - problems and you want to refer to
03:36 - something it should be down in there
03:38 - and sandbox at css is where you're going
03:40 - to code things up
03:41 - index is our basic html file
03:44 - this is the markup we're going to be
03:46 - using that is all the markup it takes to
03:48 - give us the base to build our css3
03:51 - illustration style coffee cup
03:54 - so we have the coffee wrapping
03:55 - everything
03:57 - that div and then we have a div with a
03:58 - class of handle i did with the class of
04:00 - coffee cup and it did with the class of
04:02 - brew pretty self-explanatory
04:05 - over in our sandbox
04:07 - let's get started first thing we're
04:09 - going to do is we're going to select the
04:11 - class of
04:14 - coffee and we're just going to give it
04:15 - position relative because we're going to
04:16 - be doing some absolute positioning
04:18 - within this now we're going to select
04:20 - the handle and let's just start off
04:22 - simple the handle is really easy to code
04:25 - and we just want to get that one out of
04:26 - the way
04:28 - so let's start off with a linear
04:30 - gradient
04:31 - well actually no let's start off with
04:34 - position absolute
04:36 - and we're going to go
04:38 - width 127 pixels
04:40 - height 50 pixels i've done these
04:42 - measurements before so i'm not just
04:44 - coming up with them off the top of my
04:45 - head
04:46 - and we're going to give it a border
04:47 - radius
04:49 - of 50 pixels so it's a bit rounded on
04:52 - the outside edge
04:54 - and then what we're gonna do is give it
04:56 - a box shadow
04:58 - of five pixels zero
05:01 - one pixel zero and then rgba
05:04 - we're gonna go 200 200
05:07 - 200
05:09 - and then zero point eight
05:12 - just to give it a little bit of a subtle
05:14 - shadow on the far right uh hand side so
05:16 - this is five pixels on the x-axis so
05:18 - it's gonna go over five pixels zero on
05:20 - the y one pixel blur and then zero for
05:23 - the spread
05:25 - okay
05:26 - save that and let's see what we've got
05:28 - okay so we have a shape here but we have
05:30 - no i could just say uh maybe i give it a
05:33 - background white so you can see it so
05:35 - there we go we have the shape but we
05:37 - need that gradient to give it that uh
05:40 - kind of realistic style so this is where
05:41 - we're gonna go background image
05:44 - linear gradient and bear with me here
05:46 - we're gonna go 180 degrees
05:49 - that's the angle at which you want the
05:52 - the gradient to go
05:54 - and this is where we're going to add
05:55 - some values
05:57 - okay so we're going to say rgb
05:59 - this is going to be
06:01 - 200 200 200
06:04 - and then at the five percent color stop
06:09 - we're gonna add another rgb here
06:14 - and this one is going to be 255 255 255
06:18 - and that's at the 50 color stop
06:21 - now if i just stop there
06:22 - let's uh see what happens
06:26 - so we're gonna have a little bit of a
06:27 - dark up here it's gonna get lighter to
06:29 - this white right here
06:32 - 255 is white 200 is just a like kind of
06:36 - a light gray and then now we're going to
06:38 - keep going
06:39 - let's go down below this and we're going
06:41 - to say rgb
06:42 - we're going to add another 200 200 200
06:46 - and that's going to be at the 95 color
06:48 - stop leave it at that that should give
06:51 - us
06:52 - oh sorry rgb not rgba save that leave it
06:55 - at that there we go we've got our shape
06:58 - now it's going to be over at the right
07:00 - side we'll worry about that once we get
07:01 - to that part so let's carry on now that
07:04 - we've got the handle complete
07:06 - let's style up the actual coffee cup so
07:09 - we're going to say coffee dash cup
07:12 - and we're going to say
07:14 - position relative
07:16 - we're going to go
07:19 - width
07:20 - it's going to be 462 pixels and the
07:22 - height will be
07:23 - the same 462 pixels
07:27 - we're going to give it a
07:29 - border radius
07:31 - of 50 so it gives us that perfect circle
07:34 - we're going to go
07:36 - z index 3 so it's above
07:39 - the handle
07:41 - and anything below the z index of three
07:44 - and now we're gonna give it a box shadow
07:47 - of
07:49 - 10 pixels 35 pixels 30 pixels
07:54 - 7 pixels
07:55 - and rgba i'll show you what this looks
07:57 - like in a sec
07:58 - it's going to be
08:00 - well it could be 50 but to be specific
08:02 - 49 49 49 that's the color i decided in
08:04 - photoshop
08:06 - okay save that
08:08 - okay so you see the outline here and
08:10 - then the shadow it's casting so you see
08:11 - that the that's the light source it's
08:13 - coming from that sort of angle so that's
08:15 - what we want to go for right there and
08:17 - now
08:19 - this is the fun part this is where we
08:21 - create a radial gradient this is going
08:23 - to be a fun one we're going to have to
08:25 - create the shadows and the outlines of
08:28 - the porcelain cup itself and then the
08:31 - the crema
08:32 - the ring the ring of crema is what we're
08:34 - going to be creating here all in one
08:37 - background image
08:40 - all right radial gradient
08:43 - first thing is going to be 50 and 50
08:46 - that is basically center center we want
08:48 - the gradient to come from the center
08:51 - outwards is what we're doing here
08:55 - comma
08:56 - we're going to go down to the next line
08:58 - only for readability purposes here
09:00 - and we're going to say
09:02 - rgb
09:04 - it's going to be 14
09:06 - 7 and zero
09:08 - this color is going to be at the 65
09:12 - color stop so 65
09:15 - from the center towards the edge
09:18 - all right and let's add another line
09:19 - here
09:21 - rgb
09:23 - and that's going to be
09:24 - 185 144 and 18
09:29 - and that is going to be at the 75 color
09:31 - stop let's see what this gives us
09:33 - okay so now you can start to see what's
09:35 - going on so we added our first color
09:36 - stop at 65
09:38 - and it's uh near black
09:41 - it's kind of a dark dark brown this rgb
09:43 - color right here at the 65
09:46 - color stop and then at 75 percent we're
09:48 - going to transition into this color
09:49 - which is that golden crema color so over
09:52 - here from the center
09:54 - and this is the full circle here so 65
09:56 - percent of the way in so
09:58 - right there we got that dark brown and
10:01 - then from
10:02 - at the 75 color stop right here we have
10:05 - this golden color so in between is the
10:07 - transition so that's how that works
10:10 - now let's keep going because we do have
10:11 - more to add okay the next line is rgb
10:15 - and this color will be 129
10:18 - 129
10:20 - and then also at the 75 color stop so
10:22 - it's going to be a hard line let's see
10:24 - what that gives us
10:25 - okay so now we're it's going to cut off
10:28 - right here at the 75 percent color stop
10:30 - hard because it's right at this there's
10:31 - no transition like this one from this
10:34 - color to this color it just stops right
10:36 - at the same spot so
10:39 - this is a gray
10:40 - and we're going to actually transition
10:42 - that into a white now so let's go back
10:46 - and we're going to say rgb
10:48 - and this one will be 255
10:50 - 255 255 which is just white and that's
10:54 - at the 95 color stop so that's going to
10:56 - transition let's see what that gives us
10:58 - okay now you can start to see how this
10:59 - is starting to take shape into a cup so
11:01 - now what i want to do for the last color
11:03 - at the 100 mark is just fade it back
11:05 - down a little bit to gray so it has that
11:07 - bevel i don't have a coffee cup on me
11:09 - but
11:10 - the the light source will also cast a
11:12 - shadow around the outside just to make
11:14 - it look like it's rounding back down on
11:16 - the outside of the porcelain cup
11:19 - or whatever material coffee cups are
11:21 - made of
11:22 - so one more here we're going to say rgb
11:26 - and that will be 161
11:28 - and 161
11:30 - at the 100 color stop and then just
11:32 - finish it off there
11:35 - like that
11:37 - and now you could see that it rounds it
11:40 - back out at the outside so now it's
11:42 - giving us that nice
11:43 - shape all right and now what we're going
11:45 - to do i think that's all for the coffee
11:47 - cup and the that base layer of coffee
11:50 - with the crema now what we want to do is
11:51 - actually have
11:52 - the brew so we have over here we're
11:55 - gonna say
11:56 - brew and this is the coffee itself it's
11:58 - gonna be really simple we're just gonna
11:59 - make it uh look a little bit more
12:02 - have a little bit more depth we're gonna
12:04 - give that coffee an actual gradient
12:06 - so this element is gonna be position
12:08 - absolute as well
12:10 - we're gonna say width is 316 pixels by
12:14 - the same in height
12:17 - the z index will be four
12:19 - we're going to say
12:22 - box shadow is five pixels on the x five
12:26 - pixels on the y zero is blur and zero is
12:29 - spread
12:30 - rgba this is
12:32 - 252 by 232
12:35 - by 185
12:39 - and 0.5
12:41 - as in the alpha channel so save this i'm
12:45 - not sure you'll see it anywhere yet
12:47 - here it is so you can see just a square
12:50 - so this is going to give us
12:52 - that this is going to be that outline
12:55 - that um
12:58 - well you can see down here this outline
12:59 - it's going to be this but because it's a
13:01 - it's a rectangle
13:03 - we need to round that out so that's
13:04 - going to be quite simple all we need to
13:06 - do is say border radius and that's going
13:08 - to be 50
13:09 - save that that will round it out
13:11 - you'll see it here and somewhere down
13:13 - where it shouldn't be so we're going to
13:14 - position that in the correct spot so
13:16 - let's say
13:17 - top 50 percent and then left
13:20 - well it's going to be about 70 pixels in
13:22 - save that
13:25 - okay so something is going on here
13:28 - uh okay so 50 i went 50 down so this is
13:30 - the element itself i went 50 down for
13:33 - that element which is here so the top of
13:35 - the top left of it will be somewhere
13:37 - around here
13:39 - okay so that means i'm going to actually
13:40 - use the
13:41 - transform property
13:44 - we did this a few times in this course
13:46 - we're going to do the translate y
13:48 - and just say negative 50 relative to
13:51 - that top position and it's going to
13:52 - bring it up 50 percent
13:54 - uh and match it perfectly in
13:57 - the spot where we want it to be like
13:59 - that
14:01 - now i'm looking at it here
14:03 - it's a little bit different than this
14:04 - one
14:05 - and okay i think what we're going to do
14:07 - now
14:09 - this might change a bit now once we add
14:11 - a color so i'm going to actually add a
14:12 - gradient in here so let's go and say
14:15 - background image
14:18 - we're going to do a linear gradient and
14:19 - this is going to look like this we're
14:20 - going to go 140 degrees so that angle
14:23 - top like top left to bottom right ish
14:27 - and now we're going to go like this
14:29 - we're going to say rgb
14:31 - this is going to be 0 0 0 and that's
14:33 - just flat black at the zero percent
14:35 - color stop we're going to add another
14:37 - line here rgb this is going to be 52 26
14:40 - and zero be pretty dark it's that brown
14:43 - at the 100 color stop very very simple
14:45 - save it
14:46 - and there we go that's more like it so
14:49 - the problem was we didn't have a
14:51 - background image so if i were to remove
14:53 - this
14:54 - style altogether and then check out our
14:56 - crema it doesn't line up properly and
14:59 - that's because our circle wasn't filling
15:01 - out
15:02 - this area so if i put the background
15:04 - image back it actually cleans it up
15:06 - quite nice that's exactly what i'm
15:08 - looking for
15:09 - beautiful
15:11 - all right and one last thing is just put
15:12 - this handle back we need to put that
15:13 - handle back where it belongs and then we
15:16 - are done with our css3 coffee cup i hate
15:18 - to see it we are then after that we're
15:20 - done with the course but let's not talk
15:22 - about that right now i'm going to cry
15:25 - sounded a little bit like peter griffin
15:27 - peter griffin that was a pretty bad
15:30 - impression actually
15:31 - okay so now what we're going to do
15:33 - is put the handle
15:35 - in its correct position and that's going
15:37 - to be simple let's just say top 50
15:40 - percent
15:42 - and write
15:43 - 40 pixels in from the right save that
15:46 - okay so it's a little bit too low
15:47 - because the top of this is
15:49 - at the fifth
15:51 - at fifty percent of its parents so we're
15:52 - actually going to bring that up
15:54 - to the perfect center and that's going
15:56 - to be using the transform
15:58 - translate
16:00 - y
16:02 - negative 50 percent
16:06 - and save that it's going to center it
16:08 - perfectly
16:09 - that looks amazing let's compare it to
16:12 - the final
16:13 - identical
16:15 - looking absolutely fantastic
16:18 - wow
16:19 - congratulations everybody on completing
16:22 - css3 in 30 days you just did 30 days of
16:25 - css3 building projects learning more
16:27 - about css3 and in general just leveling
16:30 - up your front-end web developer game
16:33 - congrats on that i loved that you hung
16:36 - out with me for this past month i hope
16:38 - you're not too sick of me because i
16:40 - certainly hope that this is just the
16:42 - beginning of our journey together if you
16:45 - found any value in this course share it
16:48 - with a friend share it with a family
16:50 - member heck share it with your
16:51 - grandmother or your dad it doesn't
16:54 - matter anyone you feel would get value
16:56 - from this course send them this way and
16:59 - let's see if we can't make a web
17:00 - developer out of them too again thank
17:02 - you so much you're the best
17:04 - have a great day and i will hopefully
17:06 - see you in another course on the flip
17:08 - side and as always
17:11 - happy coding
17:12 - bye now
