00:00 - yo this is mike williams or you might
00:02 - know me on social as yo remy um so i
00:06 - built quite a few marketplaces in the
00:08 - past and uh probably one of the more
00:10 - notable ones uh studio time which is an
00:12 - airbnb for music studios uh most of the
00:15 - mvps i build are without code and using
00:19 - share tribes um hosted marketplace
00:22 - solution which is turnkey
00:24 - so i'm gonna make a brief tutorial right
00:27 - now first i wanna walk you through
00:29 - setting up
00:31 - an initial
00:33 - marketplace using sharetribe's hosted
00:35 - platform
00:37 - and
00:38 - it's great for creating an initial mvp
00:40 - so you can use it for creating
00:43 - marketplaces for selling
00:46 - products or goods
00:48 - rentals
00:49 - or services but for the sake of this to
00:51 - kind of keep it as close parallel as
00:54 - airbnb as possible
00:56 - we're going to go with rentals and we're
00:57 - actually just going to call it studio
00:59 - bnb and pretty much make it uh
01:02 - studio time meets airbnb
01:04 - all right so let's go ahead and get
01:05 - started and we're going to walk through
01:06 - this right now
01:08 - so i'm just going to go ahead and put my
01:11 - email in
01:13 - and select the country
01:16 - and
01:17 - the language which is actually going to
01:19 - be the default language for the
01:21 - marketplace
01:23 - so that's step two and just gonna enter
01:25 - my name
01:25 - [Music]
01:27 - here
01:28 - so
01:29 - and then create a password
01:36 - and then as i mentioned the different
01:37 - marketplace types they have that
01:40 - share tribe suitable for is products or
01:43 - goods rentals or services so we're going
01:45 - to go with renault since we're going to
01:46 - do an airbnb so we're going to call it
01:48 - studio b and b once again and agree to
01:51 - their terms
01:52 - and then create so this is creating the
01:54 - marketplace right now
01:57 - all right so that's the initial sign up
02:00 - process literally just from going to
02:02 - sharetribe.com and just clicking on
02:04 - getting started so it automatically um
02:07 - sets up a marketplace for me
02:09 - up here i did
02:11 - two previous ones that had to delete the
02:13 - videos so this is studio b and b two um
02:15 - but that would be the
02:16 - urlstudiobnb.sharetribe.com
02:19 - and we're gonna close out this little
02:21 - help chat
02:22 - but they drop you right into the main
02:24 - admin dashboard um it created a user
02:26 - account for me up here so that was using
02:29 - my first name last name email entered
02:31 - and password and then you can see right
02:33 - here i have a user account and it's just
02:35 - selected as an admin so now i'm on the
02:37 - dashboard
02:38 - so they have a really good onboarding
02:40 - process right here
02:42 - and we're just going to go ahead and set
02:43 - up the marketplace
02:45 - so
02:46 - we're going to add
02:48 - the basic information for the
02:49 - marketplace
02:51 - and
02:52 - right here so the marketplace name was
02:54 - already entered so that was studio time
02:56 - same thing up at the language you can
02:58 - enter multiple languages
03:00 - uh but i would not recommend having
03:02 - multiple languages and dealing with
03:03 - localization and whatnot for simply
03:05 - validating an mvp uh that's typically
03:08 - not the best thing to do when you're
03:09 - trying to validate a marketplace
03:11 - uh so
03:13 - since this is like a
03:15 - airbnb for music studios our slogan is
03:17 - just going to be um find and book music
03:19 - studios
03:21 - there we go and then the kind of tagline
03:24 - is just going to be the easiest
03:27 - way to
03:28 - find and book music videos just keep it
03:31 - simple
03:33 - and then the search help text is
03:36 - actually going to be
03:37 - um
03:38 - when you click on the search icon at the
03:40 - very top and the top nav it drops down
03:42 - right here and it says search is a hint
03:44 - text so
03:47 - you can actually change that uh
03:49 - the help text or hint text so if it's
03:52 - going to be location or keyword based um
03:55 - it's best to kind of pick one
03:57 - and kind of guide a user through this
03:59 - help text so let them know what search
04:00 - for so we're going to use location
04:02 - location uh as a primary search so we're
04:05 - going to say um
04:07 - where are you looking for a studio
04:09 - or where would you like to make music
04:11 - so we'll just have that and then you can
04:13 - have require users to accept um
04:16 - an agreement or some kind of uh text
04:19 - which i would highly recommend because
04:20 - this would be where you could say you
04:22 - know by signing up to the site you agree
04:24 - to accept uh the terms uh privacy policy
04:27 - and then community guidelines i would
04:29 - also recommend having community
04:30 - guidelines for marketplace because
04:32 - that's best
04:34 - we'll just click out so that way you
04:35 - want to put more text and we'll just
04:36 - save that
04:42 - all right
04:44 - so that that was saved
04:48 - and then
04:50 - we're going to click out of this
04:53 - all right so that was the basic details
04:55 - now we're going to click on the design
04:57 - so this is where we can
04:59 - further configure the marketplace for
05:02 - studio b and b in our specific
05:04 - uh
05:06 - look here so i'm going to click on the
05:07 - logo
05:08 - and i actually created a quick little
05:10 - kind of text uh based logo in snappa
05:13 - which is a visual uh design kind of
05:16 - creation tool like right before i did
05:18 - this so i just uploaded that um i would
05:20 - also upload it here for a logo for
05:22 - social sharing for the cover photo which
05:24 - is going to show on the top area kind of
05:26 - like a header section of the home page
05:29 - i'm just going to go ahead and select
05:30 - the image
05:32 - of a music studio
05:34 - and then same thing for the small cover
05:35 - photo so this is if a user
05:39 - is not logged in when they come to the
05:40 - home page you can select the favicon
05:42 - here you can also change the marketplace
05:44 - color so for right now you can see that
05:46 - it's like a blue
05:47 - you know you could change that right
05:48 - here
05:50 - just by simply entering a hex value uh
05:52 - same thing with changing like the slogan
05:54 - color and the description color
05:56 - and then down here is where you could uh
05:59 - change the default uh browse view so
06:01 - when a user go sees the home page and
06:04 - they see listings this would be um the
06:06 - layout or and how they're displayed so
06:10 - there's three different options you
06:11 - can't do combinations of these but you
06:13 - can do a grid a list or a map uh right
06:16 - now the current studio time site is on
06:19 - sharetribe's flex platform which isn't
06:21 - hosted it's on their api
06:23 - um and totally uh custom front-end so
06:26 - it's list and map view just like airbnb
06:29 - is a list in map view
06:31 - but for this invalidating an mvp the
06:33 - grid view is typically the best that's
06:36 - the best experience for users seeing the
06:38 - listings when they come to the home page
06:40 - i would suggest having the display names
06:43 - right below it as far as the metadata
06:45 - being first name with some initial that
06:48 - way you would see like studio listed by
06:50 - in this case like me should be like mike
06:52 - w just said it's kind of a personal
06:54 - touch to the studio
06:56 - um
06:57 - and we're gonna save this we're not
06:59 - gonna add any custom script right now
07:00 - because we're just setting up the basic
07:01 - marketplace
07:08 - all right and so we've gone through the
07:11 - basics of details design
07:15 - we don't really need to go through doing
07:17 - a lot of advanced uh configuration this
07:19 - that's what i'm gonna do in the next
07:20 - tutorial but i wanna walk you through
07:22 - just the uh i would say um start
07:26 - to uh kind of fully functional mvp in
07:29 - this first video
07:31 - top bar is not relevant landing page
07:32 - isn't really relevant
07:34 - because you can't configure that in this
07:37 - let's go to listing categories
07:40 - so if we wanted to create categories
07:43 - which would be the different studio
07:45 - types for instance
07:47 - this is where we could do that because
07:49 - it doesn't have any kind of categories
07:51 - except as default
07:53 - so we'll just keep it default for now
07:54 - because we don't want to do any kind of
07:56 - advanced configuration um we'll do that
07:59 - in the next video and then we'll go
08:01 - through listing filters uh
08:03 - in fields so when someone's creating a
08:05 - listing this is uh the different fields
08:07 - that they'll see
08:08 - so this looks good for now we can just
08:10 - keep it a title a price a detailed
08:12 - description an expiration date
08:15 - we probably don't need this
08:18 - so
08:19 - location and then images
08:21 - so that's good for now for the basics
08:23 - you could add text numbers drop downs
08:26 - checkbox groups and dates
08:28 - so you can totally customize that
08:31 - then we're going to go to order types
08:35 - so
08:36 - to speak a little bit or spend a little
08:38 - bit of time talking about this um for
08:40 - since this is like an airbnb for music
08:42 - studios
08:43 - uh the value prop is being able to
08:45 - discover and book music studios through
08:47 - this marketplace um so they
08:51 - suretripe also accounts for renting out
08:53 - without online payments or with but
08:55 - since our value prop for the mvp is
08:57 - dependent on
08:58 - online payments we're going to remove
09:01 - this the ability to list the studio
09:04 - without accepting online payments
09:06 - there are different use cases for
09:08 - different business models for that would
09:10 - totally make sense uh and it's just good
09:12 - to know that sharetribe does account for
09:14 - for this um and then here's the drop
09:16 - down where you could add others so you
09:18 - can have multiple
09:19 - um i would say uh
09:22 - different order types within a main
09:25 - marketplace so studio bnb could
09:27 - potentially also sell products um offer
09:31 - services for producers and engineers um
09:33 - you can create out of the listings for
09:35 - like requests
09:36 - all sorts of different listing types
09:39 - but generally you want to stick to one
09:41 - and validating that
09:42 - these are just for for you know other
09:45 - people that are trying to validate other
09:47 - types of marketplace mvps and they would
09:49 - probably you know just use these for
09:51 - their specific needs
09:54 - um but since as i mentioned we're not
09:56 - going to allow people to list us to do
09:57 - without payments
09:59 - uh we're just going to go down here
10:01 - and we're going to delete this order
10:03 - type
10:08 - so we just deleted that so right now uh
10:11 - it's just going to be order types
10:12 - running out with online payment
10:14 - and we're just going to
10:16 - modify this a little bit and i'll
10:18 - explain why so the name running out
10:20 - without online payment
10:22 - we don't need this right here it can
10:24 - just be
10:26 - ringing out music studio
10:30 - because this is what someone's going to
10:31 - see is the kind of top level selection
10:33 - when they click post a new listing so we
10:35 - just want this kind of text to be
10:36 - intuitive and the checkout button when
10:39 - someone clicks on the button that's on
10:40 - their listing we don't want it to say
10:42 - you know rent or or whatnot or or buy we
10:46 - want to make it book now so it's a
10:47 - little bit more
10:49 - uh a little bit more intuitive call to
10:50 - action and so since this is a uh renting
10:55 - out and accepting payments we allow them
10:56 - to add price
10:57 - uh select uh the ability to accept
11:00 - payments they don't need a shipping fee
11:01 - since they're not shipping any or
11:03 - selling any goods
11:04 - um or products
11:06 - and then for the availability uh this is
11:09 - where this kind of ties into them having
11:11 - their calendar availability um and that
11:14 - is based off of per hour day or night
11:16 - since we're not doing uh nightly of
11:18 - course it's for studios we're going to
11:20 - select the hour
11:22 - um for availability and that will be our
11:25 - unit pricing units too so we'll just
11:27 - save this
11:31 - and
11:32 - [Music]
11:34 - we'll go down so
11:38 - the payment system
11:40 - we're going to click on that
11:42 - so you can configure uh the
11:45 - default currency for your marketplace
11:47 - and then also the minimum transaction
11:49 - size um that's not really relevant for
11:51 - us we're not really worried about the
11:52 - minimum transaction size because we're
11:54 - assuming that the studio hourly rate um
11:58 - if they have hourly minimums as far as
12:00 - they require a certain amount of hours
12:02 - for the booking to take place
12:04 - um then they can just mention that in
12:06 - their description so we don't need to
12:07 - configure that um sharetribe does allow
12:10 - you to use stripe as far as accepting
12:13 - payments and that would be through a
12:14 - strike connect account or through paypal
12:17 - which paypal has a marketplace kind of
12:20 - solution
12:21 - and i can talk about that in the next
12:23 - video with configuration but we're not
12:25 - going to set up either right now because
12:26 - that's a little bit more
12:27 - um it's just it's a simple kind of
12:29 - connect uh entering your your stripe uh
12:32 - kind of ids and then connecting a paypal
12:35 - business account uh so i don't really
12:36 - need to go through that it's fairly
12:38 - intuitive
12:39 - um we're just going to kind of keep
12:40 - going through this initial setup
12:42 - and
12:44 - we'll click on the social media
12:47 - so we don't really need to add a twitter
12:48 - username because we're not going to have
12:50 - any kind of shareability
12:52 - as far as prompting people to tweet
12:55 - you can have a facebook
12:57 - off and they make it super easy
13:00 - to allow for that so it's not just an
13:02 - email and password and you can simply
13:04 - enter facebook client id and client
13:05 - secret right here so i don't need to go
13:07 - set up a facebook app for studio b and b
13:10 - since this is a demo so we're just going
13:12 - to skip through that also
13:14 - um and then you would have your
13:16 - analytics down here
13:19 - and then
13:20 - we don't need to set that up that's just
13:21 - like your google id
13:23 - and then they do have like instruction
13:25 - texts so you can have uh information
13:29 - here you can edit um and that would just
13:32 - expand into a text editor as far as um
13:35 - hint text for people to sign up so for
13:38 - instance you could add some text here
13:39 - that says you know uh if you're signing
13:42 - up as a studio for a user account you
13:44 - can add your studio by clicking post a
13:46 - new listing on the top left so just to
13:48 - make a little bit more intuitive as far
13:50 - as for your users in your marketplace
13:54 - and then
13:55 - we're going to click down here
13:59 - on the email configurations and they
14:01 - make it easy to um
14:04 - configure the emails that you're sending
14:06 - from
14:07 - so this is going to be like the welcome
14:08 - email and you can also put like a kind
14:10 - of
14:11 - a brief onboard email for new users um
14:14 - but this would be like who it's from so
14:16 - if this is like team at studio time it
14:18 - could be like team at studio or studio b
14:21 - and b if you're like team studio b b and
14:23 - like team at studiobnb.com
14:25 - um and that's where you would do that
14:27 - right here
14:29 - and then
14:31 - we're going to go down and this is our
14:32 - main marketplace settings and this is
14:34 - pretty much the last step that we're
14:36 - going to do to set up the entire
14:38 - marketplace mvp for studio bnb
14:41 - uh but some different preferences is
14:43 - allowing users to only join with invites
14:45 - so if you want to kind of close off
14:48 - uh the user registration uh and take
14:50 - advantage of some kind of like invites
14:52 - you could do that
14:53 - um
14:54 - a lot and allow users to invite others
14:57 - that there'd be a field there so we
14:59 - don't really need this because we're
15:00 - allow anyone um there is a configuration
15:03 - where you can only allow registered
15:04 - users to see listings and profiles
15:07 - so it would basically be a home page at
15:10 - the url so like studio b and b uh you
15:12 - know sharechart.com or studiobnb.com
15:16 - and then it would just prompt users to
15:17 - to create an account or log in before
15:19 - they saw the grid review with the
15:22 - listings um i wouldn't really recommend
15:25 - that if you're trying to share a lot of
15:26 - the new listings uh and kind of build
15:28 - some awareness around your listings on
15:31 - social because when you when they click
15:33 - on that link if they're not logged in
15:35 - then it'll just prompt them to log in or
15:37 - create an account um so it's not really
15:40 - like you can't really get a feel of the
15:41 - marketplace if you don't have an account
15:44 - and then something else they have which
15:46 - is really good is
15:47 - only allowing users verified by admins
15:49 - to post a new listing
15:51 - so that could be good uh if you're
15:53 - validating your mvp and in this case
15:55 - studio b and b's uh mvp
15:58 - because i could only select certain
16:01 - users um to be able to upload a new
16:04 - listing
16:05 - and that way i would know that
16:07 - um you know they would be like an
16:09 - approved user in that their studio would
16:11 - be uh you know higher quality studio
16:12 - listing um or you know they that we had
16:15 - some hint text that said you know uh
16:18 - you know email us and and we approve you
16:21 - know uh certain profiles or in your
16:23 - business information um we could kind of
16:26 - go through that uh that process by
16:28 - clicking on this so that would only
16:30 - allow certain users um to post new
16:32 - listings if they're verified
16:34 - uh so as i mentioned uh now to the
16:36 - search preferences
16:38 - uh you can do keyword location search or
16:40 - keyword and location um since typically
16:43 - it's by location uh and that's a little
16:46 - bit more intuitive for users we
16:48 - um
16:49 - we put the hint text for location so
16:50 - we're just going to go ahead and select
16:51 - that
16:52 - uh our default is not kilometers we're
16:54 - going to be based on the us it's going
16:56 - to be miles
16:57 - um and we don't want to only show nearby
16:59 - because we're not going to have a ton of
17:00 - inventory so we might as well show it
17:02 - all
17:03 - and then just the sort based off of you
17:05 - know the distance
17:06 - um
17:07 - we're going to display the listing type
17:09 - in in the main view uh maybe publishing
17:13 - date we don't need that right now
17:15 - but if the marketplace is safer and
17:17 - since every year old maybe it would be
17:19 - great to ha or sorry beneficial to show
17:22 - the listing date so that way people
17:24 - could kind of see what the newest
17:25 - inventory is um if there's no ratings or
17:28 - reviews then they would understand that
17:30 - maybe it's just a new listing so it
17:32 - hasn't been booked yet
17:33 - um you can also it does have a a comment
17:37 - um
17:38 - functionality share try does have that
17:40 - so
17:41 - we're just gonna allow people to comment
17:42 - um and maybe create a discussion on each
17:44 - listing uh just be aware that it might
17:46 - not be beneficial for a kind of dialogue
17:49 - and conversation to be going on on
17:51 - listings
17:52 - so if you notice that you know people
17:55 - are just commenting instead of messaging
17:57 - studios or there's any kind of negative
17:59 - comments about it or whatnot
18:02 - then you can just simply just unselect
18:03 - this and kind of resave that
18:06 - and then the email preferences a cool
18:08 - feature that they also have
18:09 - is uh this
18:11 - newsletter um
18:13 - feature and kind of functionality so
18:15 - every week
18:17 - uh everyone that signed up would get a
18:20 - this kind of newsletter format of all
18:22 - the new listings uh which i think is
18:24 - really good in the very beginning
18:26 - so we're going to go ahead and save
18:29 - these settings
18:32 - and then now that we've gone through
18:34 - this kind of
18:36 - entire process of the basic
18:38 - uh configuration all right so i need to
18:41 - confirm my email address so i'm going to
18:44 - do that
18:53 - so i just click through the email all
18:54 - right so
18:57 - i should be confirmed in that other
18:59 - window
19:00 - all right good some confirmed all right
19:03 - so
19:06 - now we're just going to go through and
19:07 - look at our
19:09 - initial marketplace
19:11 - so there's no listings so we don't have
19:13 - anything right here and we don't have
19:14 - any filters that display or anything i
19:16 - could just simply create one right here
19:18 - um
19:19 - we do see this like hint text from the
19:21 - search that's already populated
19:23 - and i'm just going to go ahead and sign
19:25 - out of the admin account though so that
19:27 - way we can see what
19:29 - uh people
19:30 - visitors that come to the site will see
19:32 - before they create an account with the
19:34 - intent to book or list their studio so
19:38 - i'm just going to go ahead and log out
19:39 - right now
19:41 - all right so as you can see this is the
19:43 - basic uh home page i mean this is actual
19:45 - home page view for the marketplace so
19:48 - this is empty without any listings
19:50 - um but as you see the cover that i
19:52 - uploaded uh the top left has the the
19:55 - menu
19:56 - um that you can expand and then we have
19:58 - the logo that i uploaded uh so we don't
20:01 - have the placeholder blue text anymore
20:03 - up there we have the actual logo and
20:04 - then we have our kind of like tagline
20:07 - right here
20:08 - so so this is
20:10 - the basic marketplace um that users are
20:13 - gonna see
20:16 - and then we do have like an about right
20:17 - there so i'm gonna take you through that
20:19 - really quick
20:29 - all right so i log back in as a user and
20:31 - i'm of course the the admin right now
20:34 - uh so i'm gonna just go through and just
20:36 - show you a little bit more about the
20:37 - admin uh panel right now and some of the
20:40 - functionality
20:42 - so
20:43 - in in the marketplace kind of admin
20:45 - management they have a uh
20:49 - you can click on this and see all the
20:50 - users and select uh users admin you can
20:53 - ban users
20:54 - um if you selected only users with
20:56 - permission compose this is where it
20:58 - would have another
21:00 - column right here where you'll be able
21:01 - to select that
21:02 - uh so that's definitely a good feature
21:06 - they have another um kind of listing
21:09 - management view right here
21:11 - so there's no listings but you'll be
21:13 - able to see all the listings by
21:15 - the listing title so for instance that'd
21:17 - be like the studio name uh the author so
21:19 - like who the user is their username uh
21:21 - the creation and then updated date um
21:24 - and then you can see the categories so
21:26 - for instance if it was like home studio
21:27 - as a category we would be able to see
21:29 - all the home studios and then also the
21:31 - status
21:33 - you also have a transaction view so
21:36 - you'd be able to see transactions and
21:38 - then the different states
21:40 - so it'd be transactions tied to a
21:42 - listing on the status of it as far as
21:44 - like requests accepted
21:46 - completed reviews left or whatnot
21:49 - when it was started the latest
21:51 - activities sort by so that makes it
21:53 - really good as far as like marketplace
21:55 - and kind of user management
21:57 - um who started it and then the other
21:59 - parties that would be the person
22:00 - requesting and then the other party
22:01 - would be the studio
22:04 - that was being requested
22:06 - uh you can actually see the conversation
22:08 - so you can monitor conversations that
22:10 - are going on
22:11 - from user to user
22:13 - so
22:15 - you can see that
22:17 - and then you can also see all the
22:18 - reviews down here
22:21 - there's another view for that
22:25 - and then email users and invite new
22:26 - users
22:29 - so this is the basic uh setup for a
22:33 - airbnb style marketplaces for music
22:36 - studios that we just called studio bnb
22:38 - for the sake of this uh initial tutorial
22:42 - um but it is a fully functioning uh
22:45 - marketplace and pretty much the same
22:47 - exact kind of functionality as basic
22:50 - functionality as airbnb which would be
22:52 - needed to validate this mvp as you can
22:55 - see right now uh this is our marketplace
22:58 - uh called studio bnb which is our airbnb
23:01 - for music studios um and it's pretty
23:03 - bare and basic so we need to do a little
23:05 - bit of configuration and customization
23:07 - so that way we have a little bit more um
23:10 - functionality and features for that
23:12 - we'll need to validate this marketplace
23:15 - so we're not logged in right now so this
23:16 - is what everyone that comes to the site
23:18 - will see
23:20 - as you can see they have the sign up and
23:21 - login in the left side nav um home page
23:25 - and the about page
23:27 - uh the about page how it works privacy
23:30 - policy and terms of service um this is
23:32 - all placeholder text
23:35 - that sharetribe populates um on our
23:37 - marketplace
23:39 - so we're gonna need to go in and edit
23:41 - this
23:42 - and change it
23:43 - so i'm gonna show you how to do that
23:48 - so i'm gonna
23:50 - go ahead and log in right now
23:57 - all right so we're logged in
24:00 - as a user and uh we do have admin
24:03 - permission
24:04 - um so we actually don't do this from the
24:06 - admin panel for editing the about page
24:08 - and how it works uh in those other pages
24:10 - we're just going to click on the the
24:11 - actual about page
24:13 - uh and then you can see each of them in
24:15 - this kind of left side
24:17 - you would just simply click on the edit
24:19 - from each
24:21 - and
24:21 - [Music]
24:22 - this takes you to a
24:25 - on-page kind of text editor and then at
24:27 - the very top
24:28 - um you have a little bit of
24:29 - functionality
24:31 - as far as kind of you know what how you
24:33 - can edit it and what you can add
24:35 - but we're not going to spend the time to
24:37 - go through that
24:38 - so we have some other features that we
24:40 - need to
24:41 - customize
24:42 - all right so
24:44 - let's
24:45 - go over back to the admin panel
24:49 - all right so now we're in the admin
24:51 - panel
24:52 - and
24:57 - our basic listing categories since we're
25:00 - only offering music studios uh and then
25:02 - the we're gonna basically have
25:05 - um
25:06 - the the different types of studios as uh
25:09 - filters um that way that'll populate on
25:11 - the homepage
25:13 - and we're sticking to music studios
25:14 - we're not going to add any other kind of
25:15 - main categories if we were going to be a
25:18 - studio bnb and we wanted to have for
25:19 - instance photo studios
25:21 - um you know video studios then we could
25:24 - add other categories and then that way
25:26 - when you click on post new listing as
25:28 - the user that is trying to list their
25:31 - studio you could select uh which
25:34 - category of studio
25:35 - but we're not gonna we don't need to
25:36 - configure that for our mvp
25:40 - so we're good with the categories um
25:42 - we're also
25:44 - the different uh
25:46 - fields and filters as i mentioned so we
25:48 - do need to create a filter
25:50 - um for the different studio types so the
25:54 - current uh fields um which can also be
25:57 - filters
25:58 - uh and this is what that the different
26:00 - text fields that are going to be on the
26:01 - listing creation process are listing
26:03 - title price description expiration date
26:06 - location and image really don't need
26:08 - expiration date we're not going to worry
26:10 - about removing it though um we are going
26:12 - to add a check box group
26:16 - and
26:17 - uh we're going to call that studio type
26:19 - is the title of it and
26:21 - [Music]
26:23 - i can type
26:24 - there we go and so it's going to be
26:26 - mandatory when each person creates a
26:28 - listing and then we're going to display
26:29 - this on the home page um so we do want
26:32 - that display on the left so it makes it
26:33 - easy for users uh to select a filter as
26:36 - far as which
26:38 - type of suit they're looking for so
26:40 - we're just going to stick with two just
26:41 - for simplicity in this
26:43 - quick tutorial so home studio we're
26:46 - going to add another so we're going to
26:47 - add top line studio
26:51 - all right so those are two
26:56 - we don't need to set up payments right
26:58 - now thanks for the prompt
27:00 - so those are our two different um types
27:03 - which are going to be filters on the
27:04 - home page
27:09 - and then
27:10 - i also for the sake of this tutorial
27:12 - added a
27:14 - added back-end order type of renting out
27:16 - without accepting payments because i
27:18 - can't demo posting a new listing without
27:20 - uh doing a the payment integration so i
27:23 - just added that so i can do a kind of
27:25 - quick demo
27:26 - um
27:27 - but that's our basic configuration so
27:30 - let's go back to the home page
27:34 - we don't have any new listings but as
27:36 - you can see the studio type is on the
27:38 - left um so you can select home studio
27:40 - top line studio
27:43 - and then we're going to go back to the
27:44 - admin dashboard
27:57 - and
27:59 - we are
27:59 - [Music]
28:01 - going to add a number
28:03 - and we're going to call this uh price
28:06 - and
28:07 - we're not going to make this mandatory
28:09 - but we're going to display a filter
28:10 - so our minimum is going to be 10 and our
28:13 - um maximum is going to be we'll just say
28:16 - 400
28:18 - um and then we'll just call it price uh
28:20 - per hour well hourly rental will be
28:23 - displayed in the listing so we don't
28:24 - need that so
28:25 - i'm just going to save this
28:28 - and then we're going to go back to the
28:30 - home page
28:33 - and as you can see now we have a slider
28:36 - that's going to serve as a or act as a
28:39 - price filter so this can then update all
28:41 - of our listings so as we start to build
28:44 - our listing inventory and have uh you
28:46 - know 10 50 to 100 steel listings this
28:49 - will make it really um this will make it
28:52 - really a better user experience for
28:53 - people to discover the right studio
28:56 - and then
28:57 - conversions to bookings
29:00 - so this is the basic configuration this
29:02 - is actually all we need to configure um
29:04 - and all the kind of functionality on on
29:06 - both ends uh as the kind of marketplace
29:09 - uh adding capabilities and then also
29:12 - as far as usability from the user side
29:14 - so now that we have the initial
29:16 - marketplace set up we need to go through
29:18 - and do a kind of a prep for our first
29:22 - real users and launch
29:23 - um so we need to make it very intuitive
29:26 - for users uh that way uh they can have
29:28 - the best experience and we can get uh
29:30 - um a little bit uh better
29:33 - feedback um and some external validation
29:35 - for for this mvp so let's go through
29:38 - right now um one of the first things
29:39 - that we're going to need to do um is of
29:42 - course post a listing um so before we
29:44 - try to onboard um
29:46 - new inventory from other people we
29:48 - should probably create our own uh and
29:50 - use a place a placeholder with some kind
29:52 - of some tips on the listing and that's
29:55 - what i actually did for studio time um
29:58 - when i uh right before i initially
30:00 - reached out to a few of the first
30:01 - studios and i still actually had the
30:03 - kind of placeholder listing on there
30:05 - when i when i launched on product time
30:08 - um and then even when it was picked up
30:10 - by press so we're going to click on post
30:12 - a new listing
30:13 - and
30:14 - we're going to do renting out without
30:16 - accepting payments because once again i
30:18 - don't have the payments integrated yet
30:20 - um on this mvp so
30:23 - uh we would need to do that uh before we
30:25 - did launch of course too
30:27 - because we want uh
30:29 - our first inventory of real users to
30:31 - actually enter their payout information
30:33 - too which is really simple so we'll just
30:35 - do
30:36 - see
30:37 - your studio here
30:41 - and then we'll just put a price um we're
30:43 - going to guess around the price per hour
30:45 - of the ideal kind of range that we want
30:48 - studios to charge per hour because this
30:50 - is what they're going to see as a
30:51 - placeholder so keep that in mind so we
30:53 - can uh put 50 if that's about what uh
30:57 - the price
30:58 - we would ideally like to see so we'll
31:00 - say see your listing here
31:02 - and i'm not going to extensively type
31:04 - this out um but i'm just going to put
31:06 - the placeholder and then we would
31:08 - probably put like tips
31:10 - so we would just list out a few tips um
31:13 - for like our demo kind of placeholder uh
31:15 - listing so studios could just get a good
31:17 - idea of what they would need to put
31:19 - probably about in this use case um you
31:22 - know
31:23 - more about the space the studio itself
31:26 - the equipment set up what it's ideally
31:28 - used for
31:29 - um and then any kind of uh you know
31:32 - specifics uh for their studio that
31:35 - others would need in order to um if they
31:38 - were going to be booking the space
31:40 - uh we'll just put both um that way if
31:42 - people use filters
31:44 - um and then location we'll just use
31:46 - santa monica because that's where we are
31:50 - and it populates a pen so they use
31:52 - google maps uh as far as for their maps
31:55 - share chart does um and then
31:58 - we'll go through and
32:01 - we're just gonna select our kind of
32:02 - placeholder image that we used before
32:05 - uh ideally you probably want to have
32:07 - some kind of uh
32:09 - a visual um image that you create like
32:11 - in snappa uh just to make it kind of
32:14 - look like very well branded and kind of
32:16 - slick so in this case we could just have
32:18 - like a background of a studio and then
32:20 - just like a watermark over the in in the
32:22 - middle of like the studio b and b logo
32:24 - or like see your studio here kind of
32:26 - thing
32:29 - and we're just going to go ahead and
32:31 - post it so
32:35 - yeah so the sure tribe's doing a prompt
32:37 - again for the payments but we're going
32:38 - to kind of skip over that step so as you
32:40 - can see i'm logged in um i have the
32:42 - ability to edit not only my listing but
32:45 - i could edit any listing that i click on
32:47 - as an admin so if we do have a few
32:49 - studios that sign up prior to us rolling
32:51 - it out to other external kind of testers
32:54 - or you know prep for launch we could go
32:56 - through and edit um some of their
32:58 - listings and just send them a note
33:00 - saying that we optimize their listing um
33:02 - and that way we have some kind of uh
33:04 - consistency in all of our listings um we
33:07 - could upload better images if we find
33:08 - some for them or whatnot we can also
33:11 - close listings uh for instance if they
33:13 - said hey take my listing down or you
33:15 - know i'm not running it out anymore
33:17 - we can close any listing as an admin um
33:19 - we can move to the top of the home page
33:21 - which is great feature that sharetribe
33:23 - has uh so that way if you know we're
33:25 - speaking with a studio because it's safe
33:28 - for instance one of my friend studios
33:30 - and i tell them that you know we're
33:31 - going to help drive awareness and we
33:33 - probably want to put them uh where
33:35 - they're visible the most so we can move
33:36 - them to the top um if you're going to
33:38 - charge studios to sign up and we had
33:40 - different levels like basic and premium
33:43 - uh and part of the premium was being at
33:46 - the top of all results and listings then
33:48 - we could of course simply
33:50 - kind of run a check on our and it would
33:52 - be manual at first um but it would be uh
33:55 - just seeing like in a google sheet all
33:57 - the premium subscriptions or premium
33:59 - studios and then making sure that
34:01 - they're always at the top we would also
34:03 - probably want to show them in a
34:04 - newsletter that goes out to all the
34:06 - users um especially kind of during
34:08 - launch uh and the you know where we're
34:10 - gonna get some uh increase in end users
34:13 - and um exposure uh we could do that by
34:17 - just simply uh clicking on this showing
34:19 - the next newsletter so here's the main
34:22 - listing
34:23 - uh and then we'll go back to the home
34:25 - page and
34:26 - that way we can see an actual listing
34:28 - now
34:29 - all right so we're logged in um and if
34:32 - we're logged in we're not going to see
34:33 - the cover once again that's only for our
34:35 - logged out state
34:37 - uh and then we'll see like our listing
34:39 - here so all the listings will populate
34:41 - and it's an endless scroll so if i mean
34:43 - if you build up an inventory um you know
34:46 - say 20 down it's just an it's an endless
34:48 - scroll all the way to the bottom
34:50 - so
34:51 - some other things we'll go to the admin
34:53 - panel really quick just to
34:55 - go through and just kind of run a check
34:56 - on if there's any other kind of
34:58 - configurations that we would need to do
35:00 - in order to
35:01 - try to get some external testing um and
35:05 - prep for a launch
35:06 - from this initial mvp
35:09 - so if we did want to
35:11 - have this on a custom domain or own
35:13 - domain we would need to upgrade so not
35:15 - on the free trial so we could just click
35:17 - on subscription here and that would be
35:19 - through the share tribe um and
35:22 - we're not going to need to do any user
35:23 - management any listing management for
35:25 - now um we're not going to be you know
35:27 - we're not going to be monitoring any
35:29 - transactions or conversations for now or
35:31 - reviews
35:32 - we could potentially email all users if
35:34 - we did notice that some of the users
35:36 - from that user management were like
35:38 - studio domains uh then we could email
35:41 - users you know sign up uh if your studio
35:44 - you can sign up
35:45 - um you know here and add your listing
35:47 - before we launch kind of thing uh you
35:49 - could send out uh invites um
35:52 - that's not really
35:54 - uh
35:55 - a functionality i don't think that even
35:56 - needs to be on the admin panel
35:58 - um but we're good with our basic
36:00 - configurations uh once again what we
36:02 - would need to do is remove the order
36:04 - type of the ability to list the studio
36:06 - without payments
36:07 - um since that's not what our mvp uh this
36:10 - you know that's not beneficial for for
36:13 - our mvp since part of our value prop is
36:16 - uh
36:17 - accepting payments and booking um
36:20 - through our marketplace um so we need to
36:23 - remove that and then we need to
36:25 - do our stripe and or paypal integration
36:27 - in this case we would do both
36:29 - and then we would just finalize all of
36:31 - our welcome emails and uh our hint text
36:34 - in any of the last kind of settings that
36:36 - we would need
36:38 - in order to launch but
36:39 - at this point we uh we have our basic
36:42 - mvp for studio bnb which is an airbnb
36:45 - for music studios we've gone through the
36:47 - basic setup um we've configured it so we
36:50 - have all the
36:51 - required functionality and we kind of
36:54 - went through a
