00:00 -  Hey everyone, Quincy Larson here with freeCodeCamp.
00:02 - I am thrilled to introduce the 2021 Data Science curriculum expansion.
00:08 - This is going to be massive. We've been working on it for several months.
00:14 - This is actually something I've wanted to do for years. We're going to teach new certifications
00:20 - in mathematics, data science, and machine learning.
00:25 - And in order to teach these complicated, hierarchical topics, we're going to have to pull out all the stops
00:32 - and roll out some really cool new learning experiences.
00:36 - First of all, I want to remind everybody that we are raising money to be able to bring on some additional instructional staff
00:43 - So that we can design these curricula.
00:48 - There are a lot of topics that we ourselves have expertise on. For example
00:51 - Beau has written an entire course for Manning that's focused on deep learning
00:59 - so he knows a lot about neural networks and stuff like that. But we don't have as much 
01:04 - expertise in supervised learning or unsupervised learning. We don't have a lot of expertise
01:08 - in teaching calculus or linear algebra so we're looking for some professors who do have experience
01:13 - whom we can bring on to help design some of those projects.
01:18 - So if you decide that you're willing to donate to our nonprofit...
01:24 - If you're already donating $5 per month as one of the 7,000 people who support our nonprofit's mission
01:30 - fantastic. You don't have to donate but if you do want to donate we would absolutely welcome it.
01:36 - And the big news is Darrell Silver is matching all donations 100% up to $150,000.
01:42 - So if you give $100 it's going to be like you gave $200. Because Darrell is going to give $100 as well to match that.
01:51 - Of course freeCodeCamp is a donor-supported nonprofit, 501(c)(3), tax exempt.
02:03 - Which menas that there's a good chance that you'll be able to deduct this from your taxes
02:07 - depending on which country you're living in as well. And I can get you a donation receipt for that as well.
02:11 - So be sure to make a donation to our nonprofit for this very special purpose of us helping build this new
02:17 - curriculum. Now, I'm going to talk about the curriculum. There's quite a bit to cover
02:23 - and there are going to be a few demos. So bear with me. First, what is the current curriculum? What does it look like?
02:28 - Well, the curriculum represents the shortest path to getting a developer job. And here's our landing page.
02:37 - Let's go to the curriculum section here.
02:42 - And just because we can, let's switch it to night mode so it'll be a little easier on the eyes.
02:44 - So, after this nice inspirational quote, we're going to see that the current curriculum is mostly web development.
02:56 - We do have some Python development in here, but we're going to dramatically expand this.
03:06 - So what is the new curriculum going to look like? Well, the first thing to note is that the curriculum
03:08 - is a line. It's linear. We're not trying to introduce branching paths. I personally strongly believe that data science
03:18 - is a natural progression after you've worked as a developer. You go back, you learn some additional math
03:28 - you learn some additional skills and then you can become a data scientist. And if you really really
03:32 - want to get into it, you can become a machine learning engineer. And you're going to learn even more math for that.
03:41 - The logical hopping off points for being able to go out and get a web developer job – one of the full stack developer jobs out there
03:50 - About half of all developer jobs are web development jobs. And if you're a full stack developer you should be able to do
04:01 - pretty much anything. You may need to learn some new skills on the job, but this will give you a general framework.
04:10 - Responsive web design, JavaScript algorithms and data structures, front end libraries
04:16 - There's a new certification we're very proud of that we're going to demo in a few minutes where you're in VS Code and you're learning Bash and SQL and Postgres and Git
04:23 - and lots of Linux commands interactively. Very cool. In VS Code. In a browser. On freeCodeCamp
04:31 - So Tom's going to demo that in a minute. Then APIs and Microservices, Quality Assurance, Information Security.
04:43 - All really important web development concepts.
04:48 - Then if you want to stick around, or if you already have a web development job and you want to expand your skills
04:55 - Data science. We use the Python ecosystem extensively. It's very powerful. You can do pretty much everything in Python that you need to do for data science
05:02 - And it's growing very fast. There's this huge critical mass of talent that's contributing to the Python ecosystem.
05:14 - So we're going to teach scientific computing with Python. Then we're going to get into teaching math.
05:22 - And the way we're teaching math is with Jupyter Notebooks. Eric is going to demo what that looks like in just a moment.
05:28 - But basically we've got tests that run within Jupyter Notebook, and you'll be able to basically learn math by coding.
05:35 - You'll take a mathematical expresson and you'll implement that with code. Instead of the traditional way
05:44 - You might write things out with pencil and paper and move things around – there's a lot of value in that too
05:49 - But we're going to assume that people are busy adults and don't have time to go back to school and learn math
05:57 - The way you would have learned it in primary or secondary school. They want to jump in and learn it
06:05 - In the most practical and time-effective way, in a way that's integrated with the contemporary tools we have.
06:11 - Nowadays unless you're out on a desert island, you probably have access to some kind of computer that may be very powerful
06:17 - That you can use to do math. And so it's less about knowing how to do math by hand, and more about knowing how to use computers
06:25 - to get whatever you need done. And that involves you understanding concepts. And we're going to teach you those concepts.
06:34 - We're going to drill on those heavily through a series of tons of rigorous projects.
06:42 - But the way you're going to learn math is a bit faster than going back and learning 12 years of math and then some university level math as well.
06:46 - Instead, you're going to jump straight into it. But this will assume you haven't done math since high school.
06:54 - And that you may not have even done that much math in high school.
07:00 - That's how basic we're going to start here. We're going to do foundational math and then we're going to get into
07:07 - Algorithmic problem solving. We'll take the math you've learned and apply it toward learning Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer Algorithms,
07:10 - Dynamic Programming. Things like that. Then we get into the real work horse of data science, which is statistics.
07:19 - And here we're going to teach you in the descriptive statistics section all the statistics you can learn without knowing calculus.
07:25 - And then we're going to turn around and apply that data engineering and exploratory data analysis.
07:34 - With this, you're probably going to have the basic data science skills you need to be able to go to a small business or startup and start
07:42 - gleaning insights from their data as a data scientist.
07:48 - But if you want to work for a government or like a giant corporation that has tons of data. "Big data" as they used to call it. I don't know if they still call it that.
07:52 - Lots of data, essentially. American Express level data or Visa level data or The IRS or something like that.
08:03 - Those kinds of data sets. NASA or Cern Data? You're going to need a lot more than that. You're going to need to know calculus.
08:13 - That's the first thing we're going to teach you in the advanced data science section. Single Variable calculus.
08:27 - Then we're going to get into the advanced probability and statistics you can learn once you know calculus.
08:29 - Then we're going to learn linear algebra and matrix algebra, which are very useful for doing machine learning.
08:32 - And then of course, machine learning itself. We're going to cover all 3 big branches of machine learning.
08:37 - Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
08:45 - So if you're counting, that's like 19 certifications. Each of those takes about 300 hours. A conservative estimate.
08:47 - In practice, we had one person who went through 6 different certifications. They speedran it. It was an experienced developer, Florin Pop.
08:57 - He speedran the entire 6 certification in 29 days. That's about as fast you can probably do it. And this is 3 times that.
09:06 - So you're going to be hard-pressed to get through this in even a few years.
09:18 - Most likely you're going to be coming back to freeCodeCamp after you've been working, and you're going to continue to extend your skills.
09:24 - And that's what learning's all about. It should be life-long learning. So you're going to be able to put this
09:29 - life-long learning in action with a massive curriculum that will continue to help you grow as a developer.
09:35 - So let's take a look at what the curriculum actually entails. Just to give you an idea of the level of specificity and atomacity
09:44 - we've broken it down to. This is the web development curriculum. This is just a quick curriculum sheet. It shows you all the different topics
09:53 - we're covering just for the responsive web development certification. We make it very granular.
10:03 - We cover things in extreme detail because not only do we want to cover them but we want a lot of repetition
10:11 - so that you're applying and then later you're re-applying, and you're building lots of different projects
10:17 - to build your skills. And this sheet which I have link to by the way down in the description if you want to visit this yourself...
10:27 - If you go over to for example the relational database certification, which you're going to see a demo of in a minute
10:35 - We've got all the different bash commands that you're going to go through. A lot of them.
10:49 - SQL, Postgres, yeah. You're going to learn all these different commands, all these different concepts. You're going to keep applying them over and over.
10:49 - And another cool thing we're doing is we're taking these certification projects and instead of having all 5 of them at the end of the certification, we're going to have
11:01 - level, level, boss battle. Level, level, boss battle. We're going to try to mix up the gameplay a little bit.
11:09 - So you'll have hand-holdy tutorials where each step takes a minute or two to get through. Then you're going to have big
11:17 - ambiguous challenges where it might take you a few hours to figure out how to build this project.
11:26 - Both are very valuable.
11:34 - And again, we've got all these different certifications mapped out with varying degrees of development.
11:36 - For example, reinforcement learning. Markov chains, you're going to have a lot of fun with this.
11:45 - So this is in the link below. At this point want to hand it over to Eric who's going to demo what the freeCodeCamp learning experience is like for mathematics
11:52 - inside Jupyter notebook. Before I do that though, I just want to remind you. We are raising funds.
12:09 - We budgeted about $300,000 to bring on some instructors to focus on this intently and it's probably going to take about 2 years.
12:15 - So this is the budget for 2 years for bringing on a couple math instructors depending on how many of them are doing part time.
12:23 - A lot of instructors work at a lot of different schools.
12:33 - So we'd just like to build a really strong team of people who have expertise not just in these fields but in teaching these fields
12:38 - to help us build out these curricula.
12:45 - With that I'm going to hand it over to Eric. He's going to show us what the Jupyter Notebook experience looks like. Take it away, Eric.
