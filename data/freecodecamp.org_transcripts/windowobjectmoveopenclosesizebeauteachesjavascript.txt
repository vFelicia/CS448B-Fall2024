00:00 - the window object is supported by all
00:02 - browsers it represents the browser's
00:04 - window
00:05 - all global javascript objects functions
00:08 - and variables automatically become
00:10 - members of the window object even the
00:12 - document object from the dom is part of
00:15 - the window object
00:16 - so if you look here
00:19 - document.getelementbyid and we have demo
00:21 - here this is actually part of the window
00:23 - object because the word window is
00:26 - implied it's actually
00:28 - window.document.element
00:30 - demo
00:31 - each tab in a browser contains its own
00:33 - window object the window object contains
00:36 - many properties and methods in this
00:38 - video i will go over getting a windows
00:41 - size and opening closing and moving a
00:44 - window in other videos i will talk more
00:46 - about other things you can do with the
00:47 - window object so you can already see
00:49 - this code here where you see the only
00:51 - html is just this p tag with the id demo
00:54 - and we're gonna get that tag here and
00:57 - then we're going to run the update
00:58 - function and also we have a
01:00 - window.addeventlistener
01:03 - on resize we're going to run the update
01:05 - function so in the update function we're
01:08 - just going to set the inner html of this
01:11 - element here this demo element we're
01:13 - going to set to be this text right here
01:15 - you see part of the text is window.enter
01:18 - width
01:19 - and window.enter height
01:21 - so that's how you get the height and
01:23 - width of the window and because we have
01:25 - this advent listener with resize
01:28 - anytime we resize the window it's going
01:30 - to update those numbers so if you look
01:32 - here
01:33 - as i resize the window those numbers are
01:35 - are updating to the actual height and
01:37 - width of the window
01:39 - okay now i will show you how to use the
01:41 - window object to open a new window
01:44 - so here we're going to create a variable
01:47 - called new window object and we're going
01:49 - to run the window.open command so we're
01:52 - going to pass in three different
01:53 - arguments to this function
01:55 - first argument is the web address that
01:57 - we're trying to open and then it's gonna
01:59 - be the name of the window that we can
02:01 - refer to later and then it's going to be
02:04 - the options
02:06 - so there are a lot of options you can
02:08 - set and i'm going to try to run this so
02:10 - it will it will open the window
02:14 - okay you can see it popped up this
02:16 - window right here i'm going to move it
02:18 - just to the side here
02:19 - not all the options are available in
02:22 - every browser so even though it says
02:24 - resizable fall scroll bars false
02:27 - well there is a scroll bar here and look
02:30 - i can resize this but in some other
02:32 - browsers these would work
02:35 - but some of the things that do work are
02:36 - the width and height
02:38 - 400 pixels and 300 pixels and in the top
02:40 - and left that's where the window
02:42 - originally showed up so if i change the
02:46 - width to 500 and the height to 600 i can
02:51 - change the top to
02:53 - 100 and the left to 400 and we'll just
02:57 - see what happens here let me close that
02:59 - and run this again
03:02 - okay so you can see it pops up in a
03:03 - different place this time
03:06 - okay well let's change those back for
03:08 - now though
03:09 - and now i'm just going to add something
03:10 - right to the html right in the html code
03:13 - i'm going to add this button
03:15 - with value of close window and on click
03:17 - it's going to call new windowobs.close
03:21 - so this new window obj is the name of
03:24 - this variable here and that's how it
03:26 - will know which which window to run the
03:29 - close function on so let's try that if i
03:32 - hit run it's going to open the window
03:34 - now let me just move the window over
03:36 - here so when i click the button you'll
03:38 - still see the other window in the
03:39 - background click close window and it
03:41 - closes now you may be wondering here we
03:44 - use this new window object comes from
03:46 - down here but what about the name over
03:49 - here the new window name
03:50 - well that's what you use if you're going
03:52 - to target a link so let me put in a link
03:55 - here and you can see we're going to go
03:57 - to this other website that's my my
03:59 - website and i'm going to target new
04:02 - window
04:03 - and that's where that name comes in down
04:04 - here so let's try that
04:07 - i popped open the window move this aside
04:10 - so you can see it i'm going to click the
04:11 - link
04:13 - and it updates the web page in that new
04:16 - window
04:17 - the last thing i'm going to show you in
04:18 - this video is moving a window so let me
04:21 - add another button here
04:23 - so you can see on click is going to call
04:25 - the move function so we have to create
04:27 - the move function down here and when the
04:29 - move function runs
04:31 - it's going to call new window ops dot
04:33 - move by and then we're going to put how
04:35 - many pixels we're going to move by so
04:37 - it's going to move 50 pixels left
04:40 - and 0 pixels down you can also do move 2
04:44 - and then we'll go to an exact coordinate
04:46 - on the screen this focus command here
04:50 - that's just going to pop the window up
04:52 - to the top of the screen so if the
04:55 - window is behind another window focus
04:58 - will make it pop up to the top of the
05:00 - screen when we first try this though
05:02 - it's not going to work if i click run to
05:05 - pop up the window
05:07 - and i'm going to move this to the side
05:09 - if i click move window
05:11 - it's not gonna move
05:12 - that's because of the cores error if i
05:14 - open up the javascript uh air console
05:17 - you'll see it's it just just says block
05:20 - to frame with origin
05:22 - code pin because i'm using codepen from
05:24 - accessing a cross origin frame so this
05:26 - would work if i wasn't doing it through
05:28 - codepen
05:29 - but there's a way to just demonstrate
05:31 - this
05:33 - and not have the error so what i'm going
05:34 - to do is i'm going to close this window
05:37 - and here where i'm opening a specific
05:39 - address i'm just going to delete that so
05:42 - now it's going to open a window but it's
05:43 - not going to load a website into that
05:45 - window so let's run that
05:48 - and see it opens up just a blank window
05:51 - and now when i click move window
05:54 - see it moves over and you can see that
05:56 - when i when i click the this website it
05:59 - has the move window button the window
06:01 - goes behind this window but if i click
06:04 - move window it moves and it jumps into
06:07 - focus here so it pops back up so if i
06:10 - move it here you can maybe see it move
06:12 - better
06:14 - so it just keeps moving
06:16 - and then we can still load the website
06:21 - and we can still close the window
06:25 - well thanks for watching the code to
06:27 - this video is like always in the
06:29 - description
06:30 - stay tuned for more videos about the
06:32 - window object my name is beau carnes and
06:35 - remember use your code for good
