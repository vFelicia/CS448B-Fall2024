00:00 - javascript allows you to select elements
00:03 - from the dom of a website and then make
00:06 - changes to those elements first i'm
00:08 - going to go over ways to select these
00:10 - elements using javascript up here i have
00:12 - the html and you can see down here is
00:15 - where the html is being rendered and the
00:17 - javascript i'm going to put up here so
00:20 - here we have document.getelementbyid
00:23 - so we're going to find an id in the
00:27 - document over here and it's going gonna
00:28 - be div one so that's going to select
00:31 - this entire element right here because
00:34 - the id is div one and you can pass any
00:38 - id if i passed in div two it would
00:40 - select this section right here now i
00:42 - have get elements by class name and i've
00:45 - passed in a class name unicycle
00:48 - something to look at here is this word
00:50 - elements it's a plural that means you're
00:53 - going to get all elements that have that
00:54 - class name as we have it it's going to
00:56 - select this element
00:58 - and
01:00 - this element both of them have the class
01:02 - of unicycle and a lot of these can be
01:04 - called on any element not just the
01:06 - document so instead of putting document
01:09 - here if i put div 1
01:11 - it's only gonna select the elements that
01:13 - have class unicycle in div one
01:16 - so here's div one and we would only
01:19 - select this item that has the class
01:21 - unicycle we would not select this one
01:23 - because that's not in div one but for
01:25 - now i'm going to change this back to
01:27 - document
01:28 - and now we have get elements by tag name
01:30 - it's kind of like the previous one
01:32 - except instead of passing a class name
01:34 - you're going to pass a tag name so that
01:36 - would just be this pep so this will get
01:39 - all the paragraphs in the document so
01:40 - here
01:42 - here
01:43 - here but again if i put something like
01:47 - div one here
01:48 - we would only get the paragraphs in div
01:50 - one
01:51 - now this is showing query selector for
01:54 - query selector you can pass in
01:56 - a string containing one or more css
01:59 - selectors separated by commas and this
02:02 - is going to return the first element
02:04 - within the document that matches that
02:06 - selection now this can be used to find
02:09 - the same things you found in the above
02:10 - methods for instance when we pass in
02:13 - this as the query selector that's going
02:15 - to be the same thing as just finding the
02:17 - first item with the class name unicycle
02:20 - or we can put in like this and that's
02:23 - gonna be the same thing as finding the
02:26 - first element with an id of let's change
02:29 - this to div two
02:31 - now you can also do query selector all
02:34 - kind of like query selector but now
02:36 - we're returning an array of elements you
02:39 - can pass in different items to match so
02:40 - this is going to match the class
02:42 - unicycle and this is going to match the
02:44 - id div 2 so you can get every item that
02:47 - has the class unicycle or the id div 2.
02:50 - now once you've selected the elements
02:52 - there are different things you can do
02:54 - with them
02:55 - in this video i'll just show you how to
02:56 - set new text or html so first i have a
03:00 - text variable that just has an h1 tag
03:04 - uh with the word the words hello world
03:07 - inside and now i'm going to set div 1
03:10 - which you can see up here which is
03:13 - document.getelementbyid div 1. i'm going
03:15 - to set the inner html to text that means
03:18 - i'm going to replace all the html inside
03:21 - div one with this new html so look div
03:26 - one is right here so this whole thing
03:29 - is div one it's the whole thing's gonna
03:30 - be replaced with just this new html so
03:33 - let's run that and see what happens
03:36 - as you can see it replaced everything in
03:38 - that this blue line here with with hello
03:41 - world
03:43 - and now let's try on query unicycle
03:48 - and let's change this since it's quite a
03:50 - unicycle this should be unicycle
03:52 - and run that
03:54 - and the first class with unicycle has
03:59 - changed to hello world
04:01 - now a lot of these are actually giving
04:03 - you an array of elements remember so to
04:06 - change things in an array of elements
04:08 - you're going to have to use a loop
04:11 - so let me comment out there and we see
04:13 - this loop we're going to go through the
04:15 - whole query all dot link so for every
04:18 - element that we've queried in query all
04:21 - we're going to set the inner html to the
04:23 - text so let's run that
04:26 - and you can see here we have three hello
04:27 - worlds because this is getting
04:29 - every unicycle and then the div two
04:32 - so we have this became hello world
04:35 - that's class unicycle this became hello
04:37 - world and then this whole thing section
04:40 - right here became hello world now there
04:42 - is a security risk whenever you use
04:45 - inner html especially when you're
04:47 - setting strings over which you have no
04:49 - control this could open you up to a
04:51 - cross-site scripting attack for that
04:53 - reason it is recommended that you not
04:55 - use inner html when inserting plain text
05:00 - instead you can use text content like
05:03 - this
05:04 - and let me just
05:05 - comment this out and
05:07 - text content is not going to interpret
05:10 - the past content as html but just
05:13 - inserts it as raw text so if i run that
05:17 - it's going to have the h1 tags right in
05:20 - there it's just going to put the raw
05:22 - text instead of trying to create the
05:24 - actual heading
05:26 - in the page and you can do that for any
05:28 - of these examples we've seen already
