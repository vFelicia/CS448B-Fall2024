00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're
00:13 - gonna gonna fix some some things that
00:16 - broke on this this main project project
00:20 - five that we've been working on so a lot
00:24 - of things broke whenever I updated to
00:26 - the latest version of material UI so
00:29 - it's version 1.2 point O so at first I
00:36 - had thought about just holding off on
00:39 - updating because we were so close to
00:44 - launch and then we ended up not
00:46 - launching whenever I wanted to
00:49 - so I based on some advice from I believe
00:57 - it was Christian that had suggested not
00:59 - to get too far behind which i think is
01:01 - good advice I decided to go ahead with
01:04 - the update I figure it's better to be on
01:07 - a stable release version before we go
01:10 - live anyway and since we have a little
01:15 - bit more time now before we launch it
01:17 - may as well get it over with now so
01:22 - that's what we're gonna be working on
01:26 - I'm gonna say what's up to everybody in
01:28 - the live chat here before we get started
01:31 - we may only end up doing like one
01:33 - Pomodoro session I'm gonna see we'll see
01:37 - how it goes
01:41 - Danny ki noticed the hacks over first
01:44 - t-shirt so this is the if you
01:48 - participate in October fest which is
01:51 - it's an event where I believe you have
01:54 - to make three contributions to open
01:57 - source projects so if you make three
02:00 - contributions in the month of October
02:01 - then you get this shirt and some
02:05 - stickers yeah I think we got yeah we
02:08 - definitely got a sticker so that was fun
02:12 - so if you didn't get to do
02:14 - this past year definitely look out for
02:16 - that in in October I assume it's gonna
02:20 - happen again it's okay
02:31 - Siberian says what's the too long didn't
02:36 - watch of the new updates well the one
02:40 - new component they have but I'm really
02:41 - excited about is a swipeable drawer so
02:45 - that when you're on your phone you can
02:47 - swipe the drawer like in and out which
02:50 - which I've wanted for a long time for
02:54 - this project so that's really cool and I
02:57 - do want to transition over to that
03:00 - drawer but not until after we fix all
03:02 - the things that are broken right now but
03:08 - basically the name of the package I'll
03:12 - go through in a minute when I start my
03:13 - Pomodoro session first I'll go through
03:15 - some of the biggest changes that I've
03:17 - already dealt with today and then we'll
03:19 - just continue on with with what I left
03:21 - off but that should give you an idea of
03:23 - the new updates as well hi Jilly says I
03:32 - was just fixing my own material I
03:34 - project when I got the notification for
03:36 - this video great timing Oh awesome I'm
03:38 - glad well maybe maybe it'll help you out
03:41 - a bit
03:47 - alright sobre hard says say my name so
03:51 - there you are
03:55 - let's see the beginning sis I don't know
03:57 - programming that's cool uh you're
03:59 - welcome to watch and ask questions
04:07 - Briard also asks are you in Germany no
04:11 - I'm not in Germany I'm in the United
04:12 - States okay all right let's uh let's get
04:18 - started I'm gonna start my Pomodoro
04:20 - timer so for about twenty-five minutes
04:22 - I'm gonna you know maybe I'm not gonna
04:26 - look at the live chat too much
04:27 - then after that 25 minutes I'll come
04:29 - back and answer as many questions as I
04:32 - can in the chat let me switch over okay
04:37 - I'll make this a bit bigger so y'all can
04:40 - see the font and then I'll start to go
04:44 - over what we've done I just noticed Bray
04:50 - Bray Hart says never watch the free code
04:52 - camp livestream so show me what you got
04:57 - yeah so if you've never watched one
04:59 - before here's the deal with my live
05:01 - streams I mess up a lot live and then I
05:06 - try to fix it so if that's if that is
05:12 - the heart of this live stream you will
05:14 - definitely find it today because I have
05:16 - messed up a very important part of my
05:19 - project mainly what I'm working on right
05:23 - now is that side drawer that main menu
05:25 - that's on every single page doesn't work
05:28 - it will I click it the state actually
05:32 - changes and reacts so the state changes
05:35 - from true to false for whether or not
05:38 - it's open that works but there's two
05:42 - things that seem to have changed with
05:43 - the new version one on the the container
05:48 - itself for that side drawer there's a
05:53 - some CSS added that makes such a -
05:57 - visibility:hidden and then on the body
05:59 - of the page it sets it to
06:04 - overflow:hidden those things don't go
06:08 - away so when I click to open the
06:11 - visibility:hidden doesn't change so it
06:13 - stays hidden and when I click to close
06:15 - the overflow for the body stays hidden
06:21 - as well so you can't scroll so I don't
06:25 - know why those issues are affecting it
06:28 - I've been through my markup to try to
06:30 - see and it's exactly the same as what's
06:32 - in the demos on the site so it's it's a
06:38 - little frustrating but first let me show
06:40 - you some of what
06:41 - I've already fixed and what's already
06:43 - been changed Joey asked what version I
06:49 - was upgrading from I was at beta 38
06:52 - so going from beta 38 we're skipping
06:55 - quite a few versions here to get up to
06:58 - the latest one okay so you can see here
07:10 - our dependencies now say you know at
07:14 - material UI core at material UI icons so
07:20 - before we didn't have this at symbol
07:22 - right we didn't have the core there
07:25 - either so the name of the package
07:28 - changed so if you're gonna upgrade
07:31 - you're gonna want to remove the previous
07:34 - packages and then add these packages as
07:38 - they're named here okay so that's a huge
07:42 - difference you know completely different
07:44 - packages you can't just update the
07:47 - existing ones
07:49 - all right they'd there is this code mod
07:53 - package that came through that's
07:55 - supposed to help update everything but I
07:56 - couldn't get it to work
07:58 - I follow the instructions I don't know
08:00 - what the problem is you can see some of
08:02 - the remnants of me attempting this in
08:03 - the terminal here so what I did was I
08:06 - manually went through because a lot of
08:10 - since the package changed the way we
08:13 - import things change as well so we
08:16 - import things from at material UI / core
08:21 - so I went through and just did a fine in
08:24 - replace for all those and then also the
08:27 - icons have changed as well so it's at
08:30 - material UI icons so I went through a
08:33 - control fine replaced all those not only
08:36 - that but there were a lot of times where
08:39 - you could lump together a bunch of
08:41 - things so like I could do list list item
08:44 - and list icon all together in one import
08:48 - right I just used brackets and bring it
08:50 - all in I'd import it all from list we
08:54 - can't do that any
08:55 - or now you have to import them
08:56 - separately so you import list item from
09:00 - list item list item icon from the side
09:02 - of my clone right and that happened in
09:04 - quite a few places so that script was
09:08 - supposed to help so that I wouldn't have
09:10 - to do that unfortunately I couldn't get
09:12 - it to work so what I did was with the
09:17 - help of the errors i was getting in my
09:20 - terminal i went through and found the
09:23 - places where i had to replace those
09:25 - things and I checked the material ID
09:28 - documentation Oh for the right for the
09:35 - right way to do that so those changes
09:38 - were kind of boring anyway so i'm i
09:41 - think it's it's okay we didn't do it on
09:43 - the stream because it was just a lot of
09:45 - copy and pasting reading error messages
09:47 - and then going to the right file so if
09:50 - you do want to do it again
09:52 - i recommend trying to get that script to
09:55 - work if you can't though the best thing
09:58 - is just trace where it's telling you
10:00 - it'll tell you the file where is
10:02 - happening in the line you scroll down
10:03 - you figure out what component was on
10:05 - that line and then you scroll up and
10:07 - change based on the documentation you
10:11 - you change the import and that that
10:14 - pretty much solved all those errors so
10:17 - not getting these errors anymore but
10:19 - still not everything's working so let's
10:23 - let's look around some more
10:24 - let's let's try to fix this let me pull
10:27 - over on this screen I don't think I need
10:32 - these we'll get rid of that save some
10:34 - say some RAM but I'm gonna pull over on
10:41 - the screen the drawer just to show you
10:49 - what's going on so there was one issue
10:52 - as well on these pages but that's was
10:56 - unrelated to the update so I I did fix
10:59 - that so I want to go to oops
11:02 - see it's the one that weird
11:04 - overflow:hidden thing it's also annoying
11:06 - this so this is not so
11:09 - supposed to be an oval behind here so
11:11 - there there are some weird things
11:12 - happening also there was a change with
11:16 - the way the grid works the grid items
11:19 - automatically had some spacing between
11:21 - them but now that's all set to zero so
11:24 - you have to manually put in spacing so
11:26 - we'll have to go in here and put in
11:27 - spacing between these buttons now the
11:33 - site is not normally really slow like
11:35 - this it's just because I'm running the
11:37 - strain
11:48 - all right so you can see we click that
11:52 - and it opens here's why it opens in the
11:59 - drawer I have manually a manually added
12:08 - visibility:visible in line so it
12:11 - overrides what was happening before all
12:13 - right I'd rather not manually override
12:16 - what's supposed to be happening but if
12:20 - that's how I have to fix this that's
12:21 - that's how I'll fix it what I'm tempted
12:27 - to do since I'm trying to figure out
12:28 - what's happening anyway is implement
12:31 - that that drawer
12:34 - the swipeable drawer implement that now
12:38 - and see if implementing that will solve
12:42 - any of our issues so I think that's
12:44 - probably a good thing to work on right
12:47 - now okay so let's bring over let me
13:00 - bring over the documentation for
13:02 - material UI as well so we can all check
13:04 - it out together there we are and that's
13:11 - just me material UI calm I'll paste it
13:14 - in so you can go exactly to where I'm at
13:23 - okay so
13:33 - there's this swipeable drawer so we're
13:37 - gonna check out the code first and see
13:41 - if there are any major changes on
13:48 - clothes on
13:56 - all right that's interesting we have
14:01 - this on clothes and on open I don't
14:03 - believe we needed that with the regular
14:05 - drawer but let's double check
14:23 - okay yeah definitely different
15:03 - okay it looks like there are some issues
15:05 - with low-end phones so we'll just we'll
15:11 - have to be careful that we'll have to
15:12 - just test that but otherwise you know I
15:18 - think we can we can use it and we'll
15:21 - make sure that we we add these in here
15:23 - that are gonna test let me zoom in a bit
15:27 - we'll add some of these in to make sure
15:30 - that we test for whether or not we're on
15:33 - iOS or not okay so first things first
15:38 - let's get the import in here so we're
15:41 - gonna import swipeable drawer
15:52 - yeah let me move some things around here
15:55 - so that we can have more more room there
15:59 - we go
16:00 - so we're gonna replace your drawer with
16:04 - swipeable drawer
16:07 - whoops there we go and then we'll go
16:12 - down here where we have drawer and
16:21 - replace that we'll swipeable drawer and
16:24 - let's make sure down the bottom we also
16:26 - replace this there we go all right so
16:37 - I'm gonna save that and see if that even
16:41 - works at all unexpected token expected
16:44 - where is that
16:59 - that's weird how did that happen why did
17:04 - we get
17:19 - oh now I remember we we installed a
17:28 - package that alphabetizes our imports or
17:36 - something it organizes them somehow
17:41 - somehow messed things up alright let's
17:47 - go back here and you see what's going on
17:49 - now with our code we're gonna refresh to
17:57 - get rid of anything I had done over here
18:25 - okay so that's it's still opening which
18:30 - was expected because of the little
18:32 - override that I did well we see that
18:35 - overflow:hidden is not I mean make that
18:39 - bigger
18:40 - so the overflow:hidden is still there so
18:43 - whatever's causing that is still still
18:47 - in play okay I guess we could try see
19:00 - what we have currently so
19:16 - you know we could do since we have that
19:21 - on open on clothes we could try to do
19:31 - the switch in the CSS with those it's
19:37 - like I don't really want to do it like
19:39 - that but I just I'm just not sure where
19:47 - the the problem is so let's see what's
19:51 - going on in these so on open climate on
19:54 - clothes it is calling toggle drawer and
19:59 - let's see what's toggle drawer is
20:05 - knowing all right well so toggle drawer
20:08 - is really it's it's just changing the
20:12 - state yeah so nothing in there it is
20:23 - doing anything with those classes
21:26 - I all we can do at least is within our
21:30 - style objects let's see how are we gonna
21:37 - do this alright let's just make this a I
21:48 - can't remember I've done this in line
21:50 - before so let's try it like this let's
21:53 - make this a template literal so we're
22:02 - gonna do it like this so template
22:07 - literal syntax allows us to just put in
22:11 - JavaScript right in the middle of
22:13 - strings we can also do things like have
22:19 - line breaks and things so it's pretty
22:22 - useful but for this case what I want to
22:24 - do is say open and I guess
22:44 - oops oh now I don't want to actually
22:46 - want it like that I wanted to say we're
22:50 - gonna do a ternary in here so if it's
22:53 - open we want it to be visible if not we
22:56 - want it to be hidden so we want that
23:01 - value to change and you know what I
23:10 - don't know I don't think I'll need that
23:16 - yeah it is gonna make me do that huh
23:21 - okay let's try it with the template
23:24 - literal there may be a better way to do
23:26 - that but if this works I'm gonna go with
23:28 - that so since everything's run slow I'm
23:36 - just gonna let that go for a second and
23:38 - I'll explain this so this is a backtick
23:42 - character so it's right below the Escape
23:47 - key and when you do that back to
23:51 - character everything inside is treated
23:53 - as a string unless you do a dollar sign
23:56 - and a curly bracket and then anything in
23:59 - here until the end of the curly bracket
24:01 - you treat just like normal JavaScript so
24:04 - in this case we're using a ternary which
24:07 - is kind of like a shorthand for an if
24:08 - statement so we're basically saying if
24:11 - open is true then we want the value
24:17 - that's returned out of here to be
24:19 - visible if it's not true so this is the
24:23 - else we wanted to say hidden so this
24:27 - should give us our visibility hidden or
24:30 - visible just like the behavior that it's
24:34 - supposed to happen
24:35 - which I can't figure out why it's not
24:37 - happening so we're just kind of adding
24:39 - it in ourselves it's it's a little over
24:42 - I'd rather not have to do it like this
24:45 - but if we can't find the real cause of
24:46 - the problem this this should work for us
24:50 - so let's check the page
24:53 - [Music]
24:59 - all right it popped out and we can see
25:04 - where's our element area so we have
25:09 - visibility:visible which is overriding
25:12 - that visibility:hidden let me make it
25:14 - bigger you probably can't see there we
25:19 - go so this is our element that's that's
25:25 - popped out now visibility:visible it's
25:29 - overriding the hidden that's in there
25:31 - now when we click out of here it should
25:34 - get rid of it yep and it does in reality
25:37 - what happens is the entire element goes
25:39 - off the page so we don't really need
25:43 - that but for some reason in material UI
25:46 - it seems like that's the way they want
25:48 - it to work so that's what we're gonna go
25:53 - with right now okay
26:01 - next problem in the body we're getting
26:05 - this overflow:hidden definitely don't
26:12 - want that
26:12 - I mean I'm I don't want that let's let's
26:18 - try this out let's see what happens so
26:22 - we're getting overflow:hidden right now
26:24 - let's get rid of it let's see okay
26:29 - that's why so we don't want this scroll
26:31 - to happen so to be honest like it's a
26:37 - bit annoying to have that scroll happen
26:39 - but to be honest with you if we can't
26:42 - get rid of it and all we do is override
26:44 - this overflow:hidden I'm okay with this
26:46 - scroll happening
26:49 - I think it's unexpected but it's not
26:53 - it's not a bug right it's you know I
26:59 - can't can you think of any drawback to
27:01 - this actually happening other than just
27:03 - that's not it's unexpected
27:09 - because otherwise I mean it would stay
27:13 - still so let's try this again you know
27:17 - otherwise I'm trying to scroll right now
27:18 - with my cursor on this side nothing
27:21 - happens
27:21 - this still works I think I might be I
27:34 - might be okay we're just overriding this
27:36 - one now the trick is gonna be where do I
27:42 - override this and what do I set it as
27:50 - overflow should I just set it to let's
27:55 - see what I need to set it to for this to
27:57 - work properly so it should flow initial
28:04 - initial seems to work let's go with
28:07 - overflow initial and I'm probably gonna
28:15 - have to do it in in our global Styles
28:23 - yeah let's let's check our layout
28:27 - component because if there is any
28:28 - component that would give me access to
28:31 - everything it would definitely be the
28:32 - layout component so I don't let me get
28:37 - rid of a few of these we could check no
28:42 - that's not gonna do anything let's get
28:45 - rid of that for now and get rid of a few
28:48 - things that probably not gonna work with
28:53 - today
29:02 - all right we don't we're not worried
29:04 - about the index just yet we may come
29:07 - back to there though free up some time
29:08 - and let's go here then and we'll go to
29:24 - all right my timer just is up so as soon
29:27 - as I make this change I'm gonna come
29:29 - back into the live chat and answer some
29:30 - questions
29:41 - body there we go so we can't actually
29:45 - put it right here in the body for a
29:49 - document je s underscore document touch
29:54 - is so stir that in there and so we're
30:04 - gonna end up saying style equals we're
30:15 - gonna say I'm gonna copy that in but we
30:19 - definitely will need to put something
30:23 - around there and then we need our double
30:27 - brackets waiter sir Oh
30:33 - spacing and then let's try that out we
30:38 - may have to put important on there as
30:40 - well I don't like to use important if it
30:42 - if it's not absolutely necessary but it
30:45 - may be absolutely necessary I'm gonna
30:47 - give it a manual refresh to clear out
30:49 - what we've done in dev tools
31:27 - at least we're getting a circular kind
31:33 - of shadow or whatever that is behind
31:35 - there all right so we're gonna open that
31:38 - up we're gonna check out the body still
31:41 - has overflow initial which is great and
31:44 - it's actually not scrolling I don't know
31:56 - it did it changed overflow:hidden all
32:04 - right so it did still change to
32:06 - overflow:hidden
32:37 - yeah
32:48 - okay I don't think putting important on
32:54 - there is gonna change anything so what
32:56 - we'll need to do then is add the
32:58 - important to the CSS the reason being
33:05 - the JavaScript is just totally removing
33:08 - what we had in there before so it will
33:11 - remove the important
33:23 - see
33:34 - all right I need to find a spot where
33:39 - actually you know what this is gonna be
33:41 - a little bit weird to do it like this
33:42 - but let's try this out
33:45 - I have never attempted to do this but we
33:48 - already have this in the head here so
33:51 - let's say style and let's put in body
34:00 - whoops
34:02 - still thinking JavaScript and then we're
34:04 - gonna put that overflow initial in there
34:14 - they're not gonna let us do this
34:31 - I don't think it's gonna let us do this
34:34 - I'm just gonna try it the but I don't
34:39 - think it's gonna work since we're still
34:41 - in JSX land here yeah all right how can
34:49 - we make this happen
35:13 - the problem is I don't have a I don't
35:19 - have a style sheet that works everywhere
35:23 - that's like on every component but you
35:26 - know what I bet we can have one all
35:33 - right so let's check out on this side
35:38 - we're just gonna open up another page so
35:41 - let's check out the index page and let's
35:44 - see right now we're pulling in
35:59 - are we not pulling any of these styles
36:03 - we're pulling in anything on layout
36:16 - you know we really aren't okay
36:34 - there we go there's our global styles a
36:36 - new ad global style somewhere alright I
36:39 - can get rid of this then it's good to
36:41 - know that I can't do that I mean it if
36:45 - I'd have thought about it for a second I
36:46 - guess that would have made sense but
36:47 - sometimes it's faster just to just to
36:51 - try something the feedback loop is just
36:55 - so quick when you're developing locally
36:57 - like this that it almost it's it doesn't
37:02 - make sense to like overthink something
37:04 - just you know try it see what happens
37:06 - and then move on ok so here we can put
37:12 - overflow initial
37:23 - and we're also gonna see if it'll let us
37:27 - add important I'm not sure but I hope it
37:33 - will if it does this might solve a
37:37 - problem alright didn't get an error
37:44 - Suda looks like ok so we're on body
37:48 - right now see what we've got
37:51 - yep alright it does say overflow initial
37:54 - important its openness great alright
38:01 - check that out so it goes to
38:03 - overflow:hidden is added to the element
38:05 - but we're overriding it with that
38:07 - important tag so that definitely has its
38:10 - uses its legitimate uses so this will
38:14 - not work we can close it that
38:17 - overflow:hidden is gonna remain but it
38:19 - doesn't really matter right because
38:21 - we're overriding that so this works I
38:25 - would still love to know why I had to do
38:29 - this workaround and why it's not working
38:31 - as I want to but this is kind of cool we
38:34 - have this in here now and it's it's
38:37 - swipeable still need to test that out on
38:40 - a phone but I'm not gonna do that on the
38:42 - stream because y'all can't see my phone
38:44 - anyway so that wouldn't be very fun for
38:49 - anybody watching ok cool so I definitely
38:53 - went over my my time on my promo to our
38:55 - timer I'm gonna scroll up to the top and
38:57 - just go down through the live chat and
38:59 - answer any questions that you all have
39:01 - if you have any question put it in the
39:04 - chat there now
39:14 - sigh so si I says hi can you help me
39:18 - with a problem I'm facing well I will
39:21 - try since I'm trying to add asynchronous
39:31 - data and Java scripts I'm trying to find
39:36 - the sum of asynchronous data but I get
39:38 - some is 0 hmm I'm not sure sorry if you
39:51 - had a link to some code you were working
39:53 - on it would be a lot easier for me to I
39:55 - I'm not saying that I definitely can
39:57 - figure it out but it would be a lot
39:58 - easier for me to figure out that
39:59 - particular problem
40:12 - De Anza Borrego channeling your
40:15 - Destiny's Child sobre hard had said
40:17 - earlier say my name that's the it's the
40:20 - name of a Destiny's Child song from the
40:22 - 90's say my name so I definitely get it
40:30 - I'm pretty sure I could sing most of the
40:33 - songs off of that CD I'm not gonna to
40:40 - subject you all to that my singing
40:41 - though so don't worry
41:02 - okay John Hanson says is the best honest
41:05 - livestreams around thank you
41:07 - I can do that I may not be able to make
41:11 - anything you know that's out of my hands
41:13 - I'll try my best but what I can do is at
41:15 - least be honest when I mess up
41:23 - shree says did you change the font color
41:25 - from visual studio code extension I
41:30 - don't think so Siberian says Jessie
41:36 - under stress now because of you under
41:39 - stress because I what did I do to stress
41:43 - you out
41:48 - Matthew says hey Matthew how's it going
41:50 - thanks for watching
42:12 - Albert says this is one of the longest
42:14 - projects I've ever seen yeah yeah for
42:19 - sure I'm so ready for this to be
42:21 - launched it's going on much longer than
42:23 - I anticipated Brea
42:30 - said I cloned the project anyone know
42:33 - how to launch it no good info in the
42:35 - readme actually I thought the readme for
42:37 - this project had instructions let me
42:39 - double check because if it doesn't it
42:42 - definitely should so let's go to github
42:48 - by Microsoft and check out the readme
42:53 - for this
43:16 - alright so the readme is just really
43:18 - basic the contributing has some more
43:25 - stuff going on but yeah actually it's
43:27 - not you just get the repo yarn install
43:33 - or NPM install we are using yarn on the
43:36 - project so if you have your own use yarn
43:38 - and then run the dev server with just
43:41 - dev so NPM to have your yarn dev so it's
43:44 - really it's assuming that you have node
43:49 - and NPM installed on your machine
43:51 - already and get then you know you should
43:56 - should be able to who sorry should be
44:03 - able to just follow the instructions
44:05 - I mean potentially if you had an older
44:11 - version of node it might not work but
44:17 - I'm not I'm not sure about it
44:30 - very hard says Jessie you the man Thank
44:33 - You turtle says he has no sleep I think
44:43 - maybe you're talking about me yawning
44:45 - all the time
44:47 - I did sleep last night I'm not sure why
44:51 - I'm so tired
45:10 - let's see miss miss Arg asks if anyone
45:15 - knows about CSS grids should I learn CSS
45:19 - flexbox or CSS grid or both I would say
45:23 - it's it's good to learn both because
45:25 - you'll probably run into both and you
45:28 - can use them together so I don't really
45:32 - know which one to learn first but I plan
45:37 - on learning both Chris says learn grid
45:44 - first
45:55 - well it says Chris also says CSS grid
45:58 - kind of has a steep learning curve
46:01 - Dimitri says hey Jessie how you doing
46:04 - not too bad not too bad thanks for
46:07 - asking I actually had a good morning so
46:11 - some of you may have may remember me
46:14 - mentioning on the stream or if you
46:15 - follow me on Instagram that I've been
46:17 - trying to lose weight so I've been
46:19 - exercising and dieting so I officially
46:21 - hit my goal weight this morning at 175
46:23 - pounds so I lost 15 pounds in the last I
46:27 - don't know a month or so so I'm pretty
46:31 - excited about that so that's been cool
46:37 - so how's everything going for you
46:40 - Dimitri hopefully well ein bisschen says
46:48 - is it necessary to use SSH keys for
46:51 - small digitalocean projects when you run
46:57 - something on digitalocean if you already
47:00 - have your key setup you just click a
47:03 - checkbox and it'll set up the keys for
47:05 - you like when you're setting up the
47:07 - droplet so it's it's really not hard
47:12 - it's not hard to do so I would always
47:16 - use SSH I don't think you have to you
47:21 - could use like login with a password but
47:26 - assuming you've already set them up once
47:28 - and all it takes is just a click of a
47:32 - checkbox then I'm not sure why you
47:33 - wouldn't want to Joey says couldn't you
47:39 - test the swipeable drawer with dev tools
47:41 - device toolbar hmm I didn't even think
47:48 - about that but let's check it out
48:12 - oh nice it works
48:34 - haha let's see if it works for us let's
48:39 - click this first mmm looks like it might
48:54 - not be working oh but you know what I
48:56 - did forget to put in some of that code
49:00 - let me go back here since I I totally
49:03 - forgot
49:15 - sister
49:19 - I was just checking out the other types
49:21 - of drawers quickly to see if they added
49:24 - any new types swipeable drawer let's add
49:29 - this stuff and
49:49 - and actually we don't have didn't make
49:53 - this constant yet let's do that
50:37 - jeff says isn't a swipeable temporary or
50:40 - did I mess it up
50:55 - now I think it's the name of it in the
50:58 - component is just swipeable all right
51:06 - let's check it out see
51:22 - okay all right it seems like it works
51:26 - like once I open it once then it works
51:34 - maybe it's just you know trying to do it
51:38 - on here that's kind of messing it up so
51:40 - I'll have to try it on my phone later
51:45 - and see if it's different but at least
51:48 - it's kind of working so it's doing
51:52 - something different anyway Joe it was a
52:00 - good idea using the dev tools - Tessa
52:17 - Zhi Shan says any resources on how to
52:20 - create nodejs and react I don't know how
52:23 - to combine them we I mean you almost
52:28 - always run react with node trying to get
52:36 - resources I mean usually for most of our
52:45 - projects we end up doing a custom server
52:47 - and node so you could check some of
52:50 - those check out our server das files for
52:54 - some ideas and and maybe some of the
52:56 - live streams otherwise you know things
53:02 - like now the documentation for next Jas
53:09 - I believe has a section on doing your
53:10 - own custom server and that's you know
53:12 - any JavaScript stuff on the server side
53:14 - is if it's not all node then it's almost
53:19 - all node so off the top of my head I I
53:23 - don't really know a tutorial that would
53:27 - you know specifically look at that part
53:31 - of it
53:39 - okay Nikki was asking what's what's 175
53:43 - pounds in kilograms and says around 79
53:47 - kilograms so it's John says seventy nine
53:49 - point three seven nine kilograms thank
53:51 - you for that
53:52 - I always forget about the difference in
53:55 - you know in measurement system so
53:58 - apologies for that but I now weigh
54:01 - evidently I weigh seventy nine point
54:03 - three seven nine kilograms
54:14 - I'm Bishan says do you have any video on
54:17 - creating SSH I do not have a video on
54:19 - that but that's a great idea for a video
54:21 - so I will put that on my list
54:27 - phoenix says y no space between buttons
54:29 - you know what that was one of the things
54:31 - that that got changed when I upgraded so
54:36 - that's there's gonna be space between
54:38 - these I just don't have them right now
54:41 - so let me let me check just quickly to
54:45 - see how many pixels of space there
54:48 - should be okay so it is these dips these
54:57 - grid deuce and it's gonna end up being
55:05 - high one of my kids is coming in hi crew
55:09 - Delia good man you won't be on YouTube
55:15 - here put your head down she's trying to
55:20 - like climb back through all kind of
55:22 - stuff to get to me
55:23 - hey all right I'll be on YouTube you say
55:29 - hi say hi
55:37 - actually I'll work on this later
55:39 - basically what I need to do is just
55:41 - there's a spacing prop on the grid items
55:45 - and I just need to put in a value for
55:47 - spacing so I'm gonna switch over to my
55:53 - other screen and see if could you you'll
55:55 - realize that she's on that look are you
55:58 - on YouTube who is that ah yeah you say
56:05 - hello hey hi can you say YouTube no who
56:20 - is that is that dad on the screen yeah
56:26 - yeah yeah you won't listen
56:32 - do you help data on a computer yeah all
56:38 - right
56:38 - oh you pressing the buttons okay look
56:41 - there's lots of people that are talking
56:43 - to us on there see them type in all
56:46 - these words there we go
57:06 - my computer just froze for a second
57:08 - hopefully this dream was okay help dad
57:13 - down here let's put this over here I
57:15 - don't need help with this right now
57:16 - I need help looking at the screen see
57:20 - team yeah can we wave to the people
57:22 - yeah can you say free Oh code we say
57:31 - code camp ha yay free code camp mom is
57:41 - mom upstairs yeah yeah I'll come
57:48 - upstairs in a little bit
57:56 - Aniki says does that navigator phone
57:58 - cause problems on the server since
58:01 - that's not a browser to navigator might
58:03 - be undefined yeah I want to go upstairs
58:09 - okay see you later
58:12 - hi thanks for helping go ahead upstairs
58:19 - you see mama oh you can give me my water
58:22 - thank you you're so helpful
58:27 - yeah I'm gonna stay down here alright
58:37 - thank you okay so I thought about that
58:43 - at first but let's let's check this out
58:45 - I think it's it's already saying like
58:49 - basically if this is in the browser then
58:51 - let's check this if not don't worry
58:53 - about it so I don't think we'll have a
58:55 - problem with it alright John Hanson says
59:21 - Nicki's blog has great info on SSH keys
59:24 - for get home okay cool
59:26 - yeah Nicki's blog is super helpful Abdul
59:30 - says hi Heidi the kid John said cutie oh
59:36 - yeah thanks thanks yeah that's my baby
59:41 - yeah she wants me to be with me all the
59:43 - time and have me hold her so she
59:46 - frequently tries to sneak down here
59:48 - during the day when I'm working so if
59:52 - anybody leaves like the door open to the
59:54 - basement she just she sneaks down and
59:58 - climbs through the basements like
60:00 - partially unfinished so there's a little
60:03 - spot in the wall
60:04 - where there's actually like a hole that
60:06 - she can get through and so all the doors
60:08 - are shut to me but there's still a hole
60:10 - there
60:11 - so she sneaks through the hole climbs
60:13 - under my desk and threw all my cords and
60:16 - comes here to sit with me so I need to I
60:21 - need to fix that hole so she can't get
60:23 - in but uh
60:29 - okay so I've gotten through all the
60:31 - questions and we're already at about an
60:34 - hour for the stream so I think I'm just
60:35 - gonna I'm not gonna do another Pomodoro
60:37 - session basically you know but I've
60:41 - either explained or we work through the
60:43 - major issues when updating now of course
60:47 - this depends on what wood pieces you've
60:51 - used right any parts of material you I
60:54 - that I haven't used that you know if you
60:57 - have used that there might be other
60:59 - issues that I have no idea about so this
61:01 - is definitely not a comprehensive you
61:03 - know tutorial on upgrading but hopefully
61:07 - this will just kind of make you aware of
61:09 - some of the issues and some of the ways
61:11 - to get around them and you know we even
61:17 - did a little bit some overriding of
61:20 - things here to make it work but I should
61:23 - be I'm gonna check out a few other
61:27 - things before I commit this but I should
61:30 - be committing these changes you know
61:32 - before I finished for the day so pretty
61:35 - soon I'm probably gonna be finished in
61:37 - about a half hour or so so if you if you
61:41 - want to look at the code it will be
61:43 - available in about a 1/2 hour
61:45 - at the latest alright so I think I'll be
61:52 - back in the office tomorrow so I am a
61:54 - bit busy with meetings but I think I
61:56 - should be able to get a stream in so all
61:59 - I'll announce that stream on Instagram
62:02 - and Twitter you also get a notification
62:04 - if you've signed up if you subscribe to
62:07 - this channel and enabled notifications
62:11 - so hopefully I'll see y'all tomorrow and
62:13 - until then have a great day
