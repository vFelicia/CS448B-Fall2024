00:00 - This in-depth course is tailored for job seekers at all levels, providing you with the essential
00:05 - skills and insights to succeed in behavior-based interviews.
00:09 - While many developers focus on preparing for technical interviews, you should also prepare
00:12 - for the other parts of job interviews.
00:15 - Parth is an experience instructor and provides a bunch of insider tips and industry expertise.
00:20 - So whether you're targeting a role in a top company or just starting your professional
00:24 - journey, this course is your key to navigating behavioral interviews with ease.
00:29 - Hello friends.
00:30 - So now we are going to have a full course on how you can master your behavioral interviews.
00:34 - So first let's understand that what is going to be the outline of the course and what you
00:38 - can expect from this course.
00:40 - Number one thing we are going to learn is the introduction and the importance of behavioral
00:45 - interviews, what they are and why do they matter in the actual interview system.
00:50 - Next, we are going to learn about the STAR method.
00:52 - It is a way for you to articulate your answers for the behavioral interview questions so
00:58 - that you can represent them in a better format.
01:01 - Next, we will learn about how you can prepare research and present your answers in a
01:06 - methodical, tactical manner.
01:08 - And I will, we will talk about all the different strategies that they are about
01:12 - researching yourself, the company you are applying for, the culture you need to
01:16 - understand, and we will go deep with couple of case studies as well.
01:19 - Plus we will learn about the different categories of behavioral interviews, and then
01:24 - we will reach to the meat of our problem that is 50 different behavioral interview
01:28 - questions and what is the intent for those questions and what should be the expected
01:34 - answers that the interviewer is going to look forward.
01:36 - So this is going to be the most important topic.
01:39 - And next in the end, we will talk about how you can deal with difficult questions.
01:43 - What are some of the nonverbal communication cues you have to understand?
01:47 - And in the very end, we will talk about some resources and follow-ups that would be
01:51 - really useful for your upcoming behavioral interview preparation.
01:55 - Now, first, let me introduce myself really quickly.
01:59 - My name is Parth Vyas and I have been in the IT industry for 10 plus years now.
02:04 - On the side, I run my own YouTube channel called Destination Fang, where I teach
02:08 - about different technical system design and behavioral interview topics, questions
02:13 - and concerns.
02:14 - So if you want, feel free to go ahead and check it out.
02:16 - It would be really helpful.
02:18 - My hobbies include watching lots of movies, playing lots of Call of Duty and going on
02:23 - lots of hikes.
02:23 - Now, lastly, let me just talk about a few fun facts about myself.
02:27 - So I have masters in computer science.
02:29 - Last year I became a dad of two beautiful twin daughters and originally I was born
02:35 - and raised in India, but since last 10 years, I've been living in Canada.
02:38 - Now let's see that what are the different types of interviews we can expect to face
02:44 - in any sort of tech interview process.
02:47 - Now, number one is a technical interview, which can vary from either data structure
02:51 - and algorithm related problems, or maybe some technology, agnostic or technology
02:56 - specific kind of questions, maybe like Java, Python related problems, or if you're
03:00 - applying something for data scientist, maybe there can be some variations for
03:04 - that technical interview process.
03:06 - Next is a system design interview, where you are typically talking about the broad
03:12 - ocean of computer science and distributed system concepts, where you talk about
03:17 - everything related to how you want, how you can build a more resilient and
03:22 - desirable system.
03:23 - If you have to build your own Twitter or Google like system, how would you do that?
03:27 - What are the trade offs you would consider?
03:29 - And third one is the behavioral interview that we are going to put most of our
03:33 - emphasis on for this portion of the rest of the course.
03:38 - Now, behavioral interviews are very important for tech roles on top of it.
03:42 - They are also generically applied to all sorts of jobs, because you can imagine every
03:48 - single company wants to hire an employee who is going to be a good culture fit.
03:53 - And the purpose of behavioral interview is to identify that what type of person you
03:58 - are, and will you be a good potential candidate to hire or not?
04:04 - So now let's see that what behavioral interviews are.
04:08 - Behavioral interviews are mostly tend to focus on your past experience of what are
04:13 - the things you have done, what are the situations you have faced, what are the
04:16 - experiences you have gained.
04:18 - And based on those experiences, situations and answers you give, the companies or the
04:23 - interviewers would predict that how successful candidate you would be in the future.
04:28 - So rather than focusing on just random questions, they tend to put more emphasis
04:33 - on what you have faced, what you have earned and what you did in those scenarios.
04:38 - On top of it, what did you learn from that?
04:41 - The purpose of these interviews are quite simple.
04:44 - They wants to assess or they wants to judge that how good of a candidate you would
04:49 - be, but based on the real life examples and real life experience you have faced
04:54 - in your previous career, so throughout this point.
04:57 - So they are slightly different from the traditional interviews we used to have
05:02 - because typically we all have faced some sort of interviews where we are being asked
05:08 - questions like, where do you see yourself in five years?
05:11 - If you are in a situation where you have a conflict with someone, how would you
05:15 - resolve that, or if you have to do this or if you have to do that.
05:19 - So basically, typically people used to ask hypothetical questions.
05:24 - And then at some point they realize that rather than focusing on hypothetical
05:28 - scenarios and imagination of candidate, it would be good to understand that what type
05:33 - of situations they have faced and how did they deal with them.
05:37 - So based on those real life examples and experiences, they would be able to judge
05:42 - that how good of a candidate you are, which means they wants to assess your
05:47 - interpersonal skills and problem solving abilities based on your real life
05:51 - experiences and real life examples.
05:54 - So which is quite a major turn from the hypothetical scenarios that previously
06:00 - used to dominate the job market.
06:04 - More focus is put on the examples and specific tasks that you have, you have
06:09 - achieved throughout your career, rather than just random questions or the typical
06:14 - questions that previously used to be the majority of part of the interview.
06:20 - Now the question is, why does behavioral interviews matter so much in the actual
06:24 - hiring process?
06:26 - And the reason is actually quite simple.
06:28 - The behavioral interviews are designed in a manner that they tend to predict your
06:33 - performance based on the answers you give and based on the experiences you have
06:37 - realized.
06:37 - Now think from the company's perspective, hiring any single candidate is a very
06:43 - expensive task and very resource incentive task for the companies.
06:47 - Because number one, they will have to post the jobs that they will have to go through
06:51 - maybe a hundred resumes, then they would have to interview at least 15 to 20
06:55 - candidates.
06:56 - And the interviewers tend to be the senior level folks, which means the higher and
07:01 - senior level folks are not doing their job, but rather they're spending their
07:05 - working hours interviewing various different candidates.
07:09 - And what if they hire a candidate and after six months, they realize that that
07:14 - candidate is maybe lazy or that candidate does not listen to their manager or does
07:19 - not follow directions, always have issues with all of the coworkers who is not a
07:24 - good person to work with all of these issues.
07:27 - And then company would realize that now they might have to replace that person.
07:31 - So replacing can also come with their own consequences.
07:35 - Maybe they have to pay them some severance package.
07:37 - And once again, they would have to go through this whole hiring process to find a
07:41 - better suitable candidate, which means companies really wants to make sure that
07:45 - they vet before they hire any single candidate.
07:49 - And that's why even if you lack in technical skills, it can still be learned.
07:54 - But if you lack in the correct attitude and the right mindset, for sure, companies
07:59 - going to reject you immediately.
08:01 - So that is why it is, it becomes really imperative and important for any company
08:06 - to make sure that before they hire someone, they critically judge their skill
08:10 - set, their attitude, how they behave with other people, how should they behave in
08:15 - different teams.
08:16 - And that's why these becomes really important because behavioral interviews,
08:20 - they help to find the candidate with right attitude, right mindset, who is
08:25 - going to thrive in their jobs, who is going to take the company forward with
08:29 - their vision and with their culture.
08:31 - So that is why behavioral interviews are really important on top of
08:35 - it, behavioral interviews are actually a great tool for the interviewer as well.
08:41 - How?
08:41 - Because you can dictate the pace and the answers you can explain.
08:47 - And this is an open ground for you.
08:49 - So treat it as an opportunity for you to convey or interviewer that, Hey, these
08:54 - are the things I have been through.
08:56 - These are the situations I was in.
08:58 - I faced all of these scenarios.
09:00 - These are the things I learned from that.
09:02 - This is my attitude.
09:03 - This is how I behave.
09:05 - This is how I deal with tough situation.
09:07 - So it's an open ground for you to score as many goals as you can.
09:11 - And think of even the real life scenarios.
09:15 - Why do great teams always wants to hire someone who has been performing really
09:20 - good for last two to three years, because they know that they can, they have the
09:26 - quantifiable measures or they have the real numbers to present that this player,
09:31 - maybe Christian, Ronald, or Messia, why they are good or why they're goats.
09:35 - Because consistently they have shown that they can perform well under pressure
09:40 - situation, they can deal with different tasks, different teams, different
09:44 - championships, they have lost, they have been battered, they have been injured
09:48 - and still they jumped back, still they came back.
09:51 - So they have the right attitude and that what makes them elite athletes.
09:55 - And same thing applies for any single company as well, that they wants to hire
09:59 - a person with the correct mindset that even if they make mistakes, they learn
10:03 - from that and that's why it's really important for you to pay utmost attention
10:10 - to the behavioral portion of the interview as well.
10:12 - You can be the greatest technical mind in the world, but if you don't have the
10:16 - correct mindset, no company is going to hire you because no one wants to work
10:21 - with someone who is not a nice person.
10:22 - So always, always put more emphasis on the way you convey yourself, the way you
10:28 - are going to present yourself in an interview because this is an open ground
10:32 - for you.
10:33 - Now let's talk about the way you are going to approach the questions in an
10:38 - actual behavioral interview.
10:39 - And for that, we have a very popular method called STAR method.
10:44 - It is nothing but a mechanism for you to formulate and articulate your answers
10:49 - before you present them to the interviewer for any given question.
10:53 - STAR is nothing but the abbreviation for situation, task, action, and result.
10:59 - And what the interviewer wants you to do is that they want you to completely give
11:05 - all the answers in this sequence.
11:07 - So this is a timeline that you have to follow in order to provide your answer.
11:12 - So let's try to break down the STAR method and we will try to understand
11:16 - it with some examples as well.
11:19 - So first what you need to do is whenever any question is being asked at you, what
11:25 - you can do is you can explain that what was the situation, what was the backstory
11:29 - on why you needed to do that thing in which you are providing all the context.
11:35 - You are providing that what happened, what was the scenario, what was happening
11:39 - with the company, what was being asked for you to do, what was the overall scenario
11:45 - that would impact your judgment or your decision.
11:48 - Next, you will have to define that what was the task that was expected of you, that
11:53 - what you needed to work on, what you needed to complete, how you needed to do
11:57 - that, what were some of the additional constraints and you provide all of that
12:02 - information.
12:03 - For the action, you need to provide the exact specific things that you did.
12:09 - And I'm providing more emphasis on the word you because many times we tend to
12:14 - feel that in a larger project, we always say that, yeah, we were trying to build
12:19 - this and we were trying to do that.
12:21 - And then we ended up doing this and then this, our team completed this.
12:24 - We try to give credit to other people because it would seem like we are a
12:29 - person who feel gratitude for the work of others and appreciates that.
12:33 - And of course you should have that quality.
12:35 - No issues with that.
12:36 - But in the interview, the interviewer is trying to judge what you specifically
12:41 - did, what you were responsible for and what were the actions that you took.
12:45 - So you need to provide those actions.
12:48 - And last thing would be that what was the result that was achieved?
12:51 - How did you do that?
12:52 - And what improvements that made based on the actions you took.
12:56 - So see the whole story that you are explaining everything.
13:01 - And then you are saying that what you need to do, it's just like a movie.
13:05 - It's a timeline.
13:06 - You are going in one sequence from one point A to point B while explaining
13:11 - everything that was asked in the context of the, of the question.
13:15 - Now let's try to think of this with an example.
13:18 - Maybe the interviewer asked you a question that give me an example where you had a
13:23 - disagreement with your product manager or with your supervisor and how did you deal
13:27 - with that situation?
13:29 - So you can give some example like this.
13:31 - First, you would define what was the situation.
13:33 - So situation could be that you already had a company that was, that had a very
13:39 - nice tech stack on maybe Microsoft Azure.
13:42 - And you had a lot of services and applications already up and running.
13:46 - But for that time, your manager wanted to create the microservice cluster from the
13:54 - existing monolith application, and it needed to be done on an urgent and immediate basis.
14:00 - So for that, if they had to deploy everything in the cloud, maybe there were
14:05 - some bureaucracies or some process that you might have to follow that would have
14:09 - caused some additional time constraint.
14:12 - So that is why the manager's approach was that because we needed to get this
14:16 - done as quickly as possible, can you move everything on the on-premises servers?
14:22 - And once we deploy in the production, maybe we can think about what we need to
14:25 - do later because managing the monolith application was becoming a huge burden.
14:30 - So this was the, this was a situation.
14:33 - Now the task on your hand was that you were responsible for creating though, or
14:37 - breaking down that monolith application into the cluster of microservices.
14:42 - And you maybe the team was short staffed and you were tasked to complete this by
14:48 - this time and date and deadline.
14:50 - But your approach was that since the rest of the company is already working on the
14:54 - cloud computing and you are trying to become a cloud native company where you
14:59 - are trying to get rid of all the on-premise servers and devices, maybe you
15:03 - can mention that the, because even though manager explicitly said that, Hey, this
15:08 - would speed up the pro pro the production and we need to ramp this up completely
15:14 - and pretty quickly, your suggestion was that based on the experience, it would
15:19 - make more sense to deploy all of these things in the cloud and create a cloud
15:23 - native app from the scratch rather than building everything from the ground up
15:29 - and then deploying in the company server.
15:31 - And then once again, providing or adding additional resources to
15:35 - move them to the cloud eventually.
15:37 - So this was, this was the situation.
15:39 - This was the task that you needed to do.
15:41 - And this was the disagreement between yourself and your manager.
15:44 - Next, you can talk about that.
15:46 - What were the actions you took?
15:47 - So as an action, I explained to my manager.
15:50 - I convinced them that, Hey, these are the different challenges we currently have.
15:55 - Since we are already trying to get rid of the on-premise services servers, they
15:58 - would be decommissioned soon.
16:00 - And even if we build everything right now and we migrate everything, though the
16:06 - development and deployment might be faster, but still we would have to provide an
16:11 - additional resources and in order to move all of these, once again, back to the cloud.
16:16 - So why not we just spend all the effort in one time and build a cloud native
16:21 - application that is going to be more resilient and it would be, it would
16:24 - solve the company better in the long run.
16:27 - So this was the discussion you had.
16:29 - And then later as, as sort of the actions, you did some calculation that how much
16:34 - time and effort and resources will it take for you to move to the on-premise and then
16:39 - once again, move to the cloud, or if you have to build a, build everything from
16:42 - scratch and directly move to the cloud, what would be the differences?
16:45 - What are going to be the pros and cons of each approach?
16:49 - What are going to be the benefits and after providing all of the resources and
16:54 - all of the details you explained to the, to your manager and then manager came to
16:58 - an agreement that, okay, maybe it would make more sense to deploy to the cloud
17:03 - rather than relying on the on-premise servers that is already going to be
17:07 - decommissioned.
17:08 - So as an action, you had your model application broken down into a very good
17:12 - cluster of microservices that got deployed in the cloud.
17:15 - And now you have a more resilient cloud native service.
17:18 - So this can be your answer in the star method, where you break down every single
17:23 - component and you explain the pros and cons of each one of them.
17:27 - You walk the interviewer through the scenario and explain that what were the
17:31 - exact specific actions you took.
17:33 - How did you dealt with the disagreement?
17:35 - Did you just completely discarded the approach from the manager?
17:39 - Or were you listening on both sides of the coin?
17:42 - Did you properly assess the situation?
17:44 - Did you analyze how would you do that?
17:47 - And after you give this kind of answer, it is going to be much more impactful.
17:51 - Uh, plus the interviewer would be able to follow along throughout
17:55 - your whole story and whole journey.
17:57 - So once you give this answer, the interviewer can have better follow up
18:01 - questions and they would know you better that you are the person who takes into
18:05 - the consideration of all the, all the things you think about the long-term.
18:09 - You think that what is going to be the best for the company rather than
18:12 - just getting the immediate thing done for the sake of doing it.
18:16 - So these are the things that leave a lasting impact on the interviewer's mind.
18:21 - On top of it, it is always going to be really good practice to always frame
18:25 - your answers in this scenario.
18:27 - That is why star method is really important and always, whenever you are
18:31 - trying to answer any question, make sure that you, you lay out the situation
18:36 - first, and then you move or build on top of it, follow the timeline.
18:41 - And this is going to be really easy for interview to follow on top of it.
18:45 - You would be able to explain the whole thing and you can also recall the
18:50 - same scenario on your mind as well.
18:52 - That, okay.
18:53 - Initially my manager reached out to me and then we had this discussion
18:56 - and then we had this discussion.
18:58 - I did this thing behind the scenes.
18:59 - I learned about this.
19:01 - I created these charts or these comparisons between both the available
19:04 - approaches, and then we made a quantifiable and concrete decision that
19:10 - it would be better to go with approach a or approach B based on these scenarios.
19:15 - And this was the task you did.
19:16 - And this was the result you achieved.
19:18 - So it really looks nice and always make sure that whenever you are trying
19:23 - to build your answers, you are framing them in the star method for that.
19:27 - You might need to do some practicing behind it.
19:29 - And we are going to talk about all of this in the later part of the video
19:33 - that how can you prepare better?
19:35 - Uh, but make sure that you are aware about the star methodology because more
19:40 - and more companies, they want their answers to come in this frame.
19:45 - Okay.
19:46 - So after understanding what star method is now, let's dive deep into how do you
19:50 - actually start preparing for different stories, different answers and different
19:55 - scenarios for that you will actually have to do some back work and then we will
19:59 - move forward.
20:00 - So let's understand that the very first thing you need to do in order to
20:04 - prepare for your behavioral interviews, that is to self reflect.
20:08 - You will have to identify that.
20:09 - What are the things you are good at?
20:11 - What are the things you are not good at and how can you improve yourself?
20:15 - So for that, you always needs to go and make sure that you are using the correct
20:21 - and different methods to verify that what are the personal strengths you carry.
20:25 - Some of the methods you can think of is maybe, uh, asking questions to other self
20:30 - reflecting on past experiences, getting feedback, maybe from your manager, from
20:35 - your coworker or from your ex-employers, uh, reaching out to different people,
20:40 - thinking or researching on the current situation you are in and many times this
20:46 - may sound odd, but many times anonymous boards can be really, really helpful.
20:53 - Uh, and why am I saying all of these things?
20:55 - Like you can choose whatever you want.
20:57 - You can go ahead and start journaling if you want.
21:00 - The reason I'm saying about anonymous boards is because many times if you
21:05 - explain your situation in places like Reddit or blind or someplace, most of the
21:10 - people, yeah, there will be some trolls, but most people are going to be neutral
21:15 - and they won't know you personally.
21:16 - So they would completely be non-biased towards you.
21:20 - Uh, so that can sometimes work in your favor, but it's a slippery slope.
21:24 - So you need to be very careful with anonymous feedback.
21:27 - But apart from that, there are a lot of different methods to, uh, self reflect
21:33 - and self identify that what should be, what are your strengths, what are your
21:36 - weaknesses and over the course of the period, you must have experienced and
21:42 - learned something you have been in this world for few years now.
21:45 - So for sure, you must have some idea that, Hey, these are the things I'm good at.
21:49 - These are the things I'm not good at.
21:50 - And this is how I can frame my answer.
21:53 - If I have to give you an example about my strengths and my weaknesses, like, uh,
21:57 - I personally believe that I tend to get really involved in the conversation.
22:01 - I like to communicate with people.
22:03 - I've somehow, I feel that my communication skills are slightly better.
22:07 - So these would be my strong points, maybe my weak points.
22:10 - I tend to dive so deep into the introduction and rather than just saying
22:15 - my things exactly, I tried to create a huge preamble before I dive
22:20 - deeper into the main issue.
22:22 - So that can be one of my weaknesses.
22:24 - Um, uh, many times I tend to procrastinate.
22:27 - So that was, that is another of my weakness.
22:29 - How can I improve upon them?
22:31 - What are the steps I can take?
22:32 - Maybe I can write down my goals.
22:34 - Maybe I can, uh, do some things to make changes.
22:37 - And these are, these self-reflection tools would be a, would make you a
22:43 - better person in the long run.
22:45 - So identify your strengths and weakness.
22:47 - That would be the number one step.
22:49 - Uh, not only in terms of behavioral interviews, but also in terms of on your
22:53 - day-to-day activities and daily self-reflection, because with that, over
22:57 - the course of a certain period of few weeks or even few years, you would
23:02 - become a significantly better person in your work ethic, in your day-to-day
23:07 - activity, and also as an effective leader, mentor, or a team, a coworker.
23:12 - So always have that habit.
23:15 - Next, you need to make sure that you reflect on your relevant past experiences.
23:20 - Because for any single behavioral interview, they're always going to dive deeper
23:26 - into the questions regarding what have you done in the past, what type of
23:29 - challenges you face, how did you came up with that?
23:32 - What was your achievement?
23:34 - Um, what did you learn from it?
23:36 - How can you self-improve?
23:38 - How can you teach other?
23:39 - How can you maybe create impact for your customer?
23:43 - These are going to be the broader type of scenarios that you would be
23:48 - asked on and you would be judged on.
23:50 - So a quick question or a quick tip, whenever you are working or whatever the
23:57 - experiences you have faced in your career so far, just start making good
24:01 - points or good stories in some piece of paper.
24:05 - So that would allow you to have those talking points when you actually get to
24:10 - that stage in actual behavioral interview, because many times in any behavioral
24:14 - interview, they're going to be asking you somewhere between four to 10 or
24:19 - five tab, somewhere between five to 20 questions, depending on how lengthy
24:25 - the interview are, what type of difficulties they wants to have, and
24:27 - what type of questions they are suggesting.
24:30 - Now for these questions, you don't want to repeat the same story or same
24:36 - scenario again and again and again.
24:38 - It would make really good impact if you can have different scenarios and
24:43 - different considerations for all the things you did.
24:46 - So that is going to play out in your favor.
24:48 - So, but, but many times it becomes really difficult to recall all of these
24:51 - things on the go when you are actually in that interview.
24:54 - So it's always better to prepare beforehand, have all of those experiences
24:59 - noted down, maybe you can create some short bullet points for your star
25:03 - method, or you can say that, okay, the situation was that a manual
25:08 - deployment was getting out of hand and we were, we were having a lot of issues.
25:12 - A task was that you needed to deploy something really quickly and it needed
25:17 - to be in the production as soon as possible.
25:19 - The action you took is that you started working on the automated DevOps
25:24 - deployment scenario on the side.
25:26 - You took care of the high priority items immediately and the low priority items.
25:31 - You refrained from pushing to the production and then you kept them aside.
25:34 - And then first you build that those automated CICD pipelines.
25:38 - And then in the end you deploy everything using CICD pipeline.
25:42 - And as a result, now you are seeing that all the deployments in your
25:45 - company are happening automatically using the automated deployments.
25:49 - So this can be one of the examples.
25:51 - So, so what in this scenario, you can write bullet points as situation,
25:54 - manual deployments, tasks, maybe deploy something to production and also
26:00 - build CICD pipelines action.
26:02 - You started building CICD pipelines and result, all the things
26:05 - became automated, whatever the challenges you find.
26:08 - So you can add few more points for that.
26:11 - So I would personally suggest to create at least 15 or 20 experiences based on
26:19 - different scenarios that you have faced in your career or you faced on a day
26:23 - to day basis and just note them down somewhere and have the habit ready
26:27 - because once you have those experiences, you, the moment you would see them and
26:32 - you would understand that, okay, these are the things I've already done.
26:34 - It becomes really easy to convey that in an actual interview that it would then
26:39 - it wouldn't even feel like an interview.
26:41 - It would feel like a normal conversation between two people where you are just
26:44 - going over all the experiences you face.
26:47 - And it would like, remember when, when during this time, this was the situation,
26:51 - this is how we dealt with it and it was pretty fun.
26:53 - And I learned this and I learned this.
26:55 - And from based on this experience, next time I wouldn't repeat this.
26:59 - So it can be a great exercise to reflect on the relevant experiences that
27:04 - you have currently faced so far.
27:06 - And that brings us to our next point.
27:08 - That is once you realize that what are your strengths and weaknesses, once you
27:13 - have those stories ready, now, when you come closer towards the actual interview,
27:19 - start diving deep into the true requirements of any particular job you are
27:23 - applying for, understand what type of seniority for the job is, understand that
27:27 - what type of requirement the company is having in every single job description.
27:32 - Companies mentioned that what would be the generic technical skills needed on
27:37 - top of it, what would be the day-to-day basis or duties or behavioral skills
27:41 - required, maybe you have to deal with external customers.
27:44 - So you need some sales experience.
27:45 - Maybe you need to deal with a team of larger individuals.
27:50 - Maybe you need to lead a team of different people.
27:53 - Maybe you need to behave as like a tech lead or a senior lead in any particular
27:59 - position, so realize that what job description is suggesting too, and then
28:04 - reflect on the relevant experiences you had.
28:06 - Try to create mapping between all the things that you have done and you have
28:10 - learned so far and make sure that not to ignore the job description and ask the
28:16 - same questions to either the hiring manager or your recruiter beforehand.
28:21 - That what type of expectation the company is having, is there anything about the
28:25 - company culture that should I know before you go deeper into the behavioral
28:29 - interview, because this is going to give you a great insight and idea about what
28:35 - type of questions you can be judged on or you can be asked, and maybe you can
28:40 - have those specific experiences ready because that comes in handy for some
28:45 - different companies because many companies, they have a very specific set
28:48 - of culture and they need very specific set of individuals with the correct
28:52 - mindset, and we will learn more about that in the upcoming case studies that
28:57 - we are going to study, but make sure that once you have the strengths,
29:01 - weakness, and self-reflection, you have these story points and then you go very
29:06 - deep into the job requirements so that you have that matching criteria or
29:11 - matching matrix between what is needed and what you currently have.
29:14 - So it becomes pretty easy and your odds of success in the interview
29:19 - becomes exponentially high.
29:21 - Next, you should never ignore the company culture and company values that a
29:27 - company tend to behave on and thrive on.
29:30 - Most of the scenario, what I have personally felt is every single company
29:34 - tend to have a similar work structure where they want to do what's best for the
29:39 - company, what's best for their customer, what's best for their employees.
29:42 - They want to build a product more efficiently, more securely, more reliably.
29:47 - They want to help people who work in accordance with each other, who are not
29:51 - having any, like a lot of significant issues.
29:54 - They try to work as a fine-tuned machine and as a well-built team where
29:59 - everyone is trusting each other to complete the job done.
30:03 - And if someone is lacking behind, then they want other people to push that
30:07 - person forward because we are only as strong as the weakest link.
30:11 - So they want to take all the employees to do better because companies have
30:16 - realized after a lot of research and a lot of investing and a lot of consulting
30:21 - with a lot of big, big and small companies that if the employees are happy
30:26 - and if you have like true leaders and true connections amongst the employees,
30:31 - they tend to drive the project and team forward.
30:33 - And I can give you an example for that.
30:36 - See any open source project, there is no motivation for anyone to work in that
30:41 - open source project because they are not incentivized in terms of compensation.
30:46 - They are not incentivized in terms of any recognition or any monetary gains, but
30:52 - still those products have significantly changed the world.
30:56 - Think of Wikipedia.
30:58 - It is a community driven community, build people, build entire software or ecosystem
31:04 - that has helped millions of people all across world.
31:07 - And it is all being done just because people are passionate about that, that
31:12 - overall game or overall goal.
31:14 - And it's a rewarding mechanism that comes with being recognized of doing
31:20 - something greater good or doing something better for the world.
31:23 - And that feeling enables people to achieve something more.
31:28 - And same thing companies wants to develop in their own employees.
31:32 - That's why you see all of these big companies, they are trying to give all of
31:36 - these perks and these benefits to their employees because they realize that if
31:40 - the employees are happy and if they're not distracted, they would build products
31:44 - that is going to take the company all the way off the charts.
31:48 - So for sure, research that any specific company you are applying for, what type
31:53 - of culture they possess, what are the key values that they have.
31:57 - And that's where the conversation with recruiters, the conversation with hiring
32:00 - manager, maybe some ex-employees that comes in handy, maybe read through some
32:05 - blogs, try to go on and search on YouTube.
32:08 - If that company is popular enough, maybe someone has posted some videos about what
32:12 - type of work culture they have and how do they promote it and how you can
32:16 - leverage yourself for that interview or for that any particular company.
32:21 - So these are going to be really important mechanism.
32:25 - Plus you can also see that, okay, company has these important values and these are
32:29 - my personal values and these are my personal experience.
32:32 - Once again, you have better matching answers for those questions when they
32:37 - come in during your behavioral interview.
32:40 - Now let's, we are going to see a very interesting case study.
32:43 - This is one of the most popular case studies and it's for the company Netflix.
32:49 - And honestly, Netflix has one of the most unique cultures that I've seen in any
32:57 - company, so that's why I really wanted to discuss about Netflix.
33:01 - Netflix at some point decided that we are going to treat all of our
33:05 - employees as elite sport team.
33:09 - We are not just going to have them as normal employees.
33:12 - And one thing you know about elite sports team is that number one, all
33:17 - players, they work for the good of the team.
33:19 - Number two, every single player has to be on the top of their game.
33:23 - And if someone is lacking or someone is lacking behind coaches tend to push them
33:28 - forward, give them honest opinion, honest reviews, make sure that they are working
33:32 - the best they can, they are achieving the best they can.
33:36 - And you know what, like right now Netflix started hiring some recent graduate, but
33:41 - a couple of years back until then, they only had one level throughout their
33:45 - entire company and that was senior software developer.
33:48 - Of course, different people would report to different people.
33:51 - And depending on seniority, there would be some pay differences, but still Netflix
33:56 - would pay the highest amount of salary amongst all the companies in the US.
34:00 - They, they, at some point they were paying somewhere around like $565,000 that was
34:06 - the average salary for every single employee or every single engineer at Netflix.
34:10 - So imagine more than half a million dollars for an engineer, which means their
34:15 - compensation or their monetary problems has completely gone.
34:18 - Number two, Netflix is one of the only companies that does not believe in giving
34:23 - bonuses that they, their mentality is that we don't promote, have providing
34:30 - bonus because we know that we are providing them enough things that they
34:35 - don't have to keep running forward for that bonus, but they would rather do
34:40 - good throughout the year without the incentive of bonus because they are
34:44 - already extremely well-paid plus next thing is that they have the option to
34:50 - receive the entire salary, whether in cash or just as base salary, or if they
34:55 - want, they can, they control that whether they want like 10% stocks, 20%
35:00 - stock, 50% stocks, which is pretty cool because if you see any other company,
35:05 - like maybe Google, Facebook, Microsoft, any other company, they have a very
35:08 - strict stock vesting schedule and they decide how you are going to get paid.
35:14 - But Netflix is like, we treat our employees like adults.
35:18 - We know that they are going to do what's good for them and what's good for
35:21 - Netflix, what's good for their company.
35:24 - And we are going to treat them as elite sports players.
35:28 - So they have this elite sports mentality where every single player is responsible
35:33 - to bring team forward, bring team up.
35:36 - They are going to be extremely well compensated.
35:38 - They have unlimited paid time off.
35:40 - They have unlimited benefits, lot of cool parks and stuff and everything like that.
35:45 - On top of it, they decided that they are going to be fully cloud.
35:49 - They're always going to be cutting edge innovative.
35:51 - They are going to do the best thing possible.
35:54 - And they have already achieved that, which is quite significant, quite insignificant.
35:59 - And the other thing is that not only being a elite sport team, there also
36:06 - be going to be thoroughly honest with their employees.
36:10 - And what do I mean by thoroughly honest?
36:12 - They have a very strong feedback culture or every single time, every single
36:17 - meeting, or maybe any project, if you're doing something good, you are doing
36:21 - something bad, you are doing something horrible, you are going to get an honest
36:25 - feedback and you're going to get it immediately.
36:27 - And it doesn't even matter that maybe you are, you just joined in and you are at
36:32 - slightly junior level position and compared to someone who has been in Netflix for 10
36:37 - years, if you see that that person is making some mistake, they actually
36:41 - encourage you to, that you should go ahead and reach out to that person and
36:45 - honestly tell them that these are the mistakes you are doing.
36:48 - And this would be my feedback and this is how you can make it better.
36:51 - And they really appreciate that feedback culture.
36:54 - So even if you interviewed Netflix, let's say that you did not get a job for some
36:59 - reason, they're going to be very honest with you that, Hey, these are the things
37:03 - we asked. These are the mistakes you made.
37:05 - This is our feedback.
37:06 - Maybe it can help you out in the future, but currently we cannot move forward with
37:10 - that. And that mentality makes Netflix what it is today.
37:15 - One of honestly, Netflix has been a disruptor.
37:18 - They have created an entire industry of online streaming.
37:21 - It was one of the only services.
37:23 - Now they have this very interesting keepers test.
37:26 - And what does keepers test mean is that managers are only being asked one
37:31 - question. And that question is that if this person in your team decides to leave
37:36 - Netflix today, are you going to fight to keep that person?
37:40 - And if the answer is yes, that's great that that person is doing his job, his or
37:45 - her job very well.
37:46 - But if manager manager answers that, no, I would not fight to keep that person.
37:51 - And I would let that person go.
37:53 - If that is the case, Netflix would by default, let that person go.
37:57 - They would be like, we don't want to wait for you to decide that I want to leave
38:01 - Netflix. If you are not performing at the level or at the elite sports level, we
38:06 - don't want you in the Netflix.
38:07 - And of course they are going to give you hefty severance package and they have all
38:11 - of these cool benefits.
38:13 - So that's the thing that's, that is such a unique thing about Netflix that they
38:19 - have a very unique sports mentality.
38:21 - They have a very unique keepers test and the feedback culture.
38:25 - So if I am, I'm preparing for a Netflix interview, I'm going to keep these things
38:30 - in mind and I will pick the experiences I had where I had to give someone honest
38:36 - feedback or take someone's honest feedback and then work on myself and improve
38:40 - myself and improve the system and do the good for the company.
38:43 - So I'm going to do all of these things because I studied and I realized that this
38:47 - is the culture Netflix is promoting.
38:50 - So you need to understand that how these companies work.
38:55 - And if you realize that their work culture, you can actually be in a very good
39:00 - position for yourself to secure that job.
39:03 - Now let's talk about the second case study that is Amazon.
39:07 - Now, Amazon has always been a topic of conversation among
39:12 - tech engineers, a lot of people really like Amazon.
39:16 - A lot of people hate Amazon.
39:18 - They have a lot of different products and a lot of different teams.
39:22 - And they are, they are one of the biggest tech companies in the world.
39:25 - That's for sure.
39:27 - Now, the thing is Amazon also has a very unique culture and very unique set
39:32 - of skills and personal values.
39:34 - The different thing about Amazon is that they actually believe in something
39:38 - called leadership principles.
39:40 - And few years back, Amazon came up with these, a huge list of different
39:45 - leadership principles, and they say that every single employee needs to follow
39:49 - these leadership principles in order to be counted as a successful candidate at
39:54 - Amazon.
39:55 - So some of the leadership principles are, I have listed over here that it's like
39:59 - customer obsession, becoming the earth's best employer or think big, how can you
40:03 - deliver results pretty quickly and a lot of other things.
40:07 - Now, the thing is if you are applying or if you are preparing for Amazon, I would
40:11 - definitely recommend you to go over these leadership principles, maybe create one or
40:16 - two examples for each principle, because you're not going to be asked all 16 of
40:21 - the principles, but most likely throughout your six or seven rounds of interview, you
40:26 - would be asked at least somewhere between four to 10 different leadership principles.
40:30 - And it wouldn't be that, Hey, tell me an example about think big or tell me an
40:34 - example where you have to earn the trust.
40:36 - It wouldn't be directly, but the question would be framed around these leadership
40:40 - principles.
40:41 - And then there would be follow up questions on the answers you would give.
40:46 - So if I'm preparing for Netflix, I would prepare for the answers based on like
40:50 - keepers test, feedback culture, how I changed the company or how I'm brutally
40:55 - honest, how do I work with the team or how do I work with the upper stakeholders or
40:59 - whatnot?
40:59 - If I'm preparing something for like Amazon, I would prepare on leadership
41:03 - principles.
41:03 - I would create some examples for each one of them.
41:05 - I would reflect on myself and this is how you can prepare beforehand so that it's
41:11 - going to be very helpful for your upcoming jobs or upcoming interviews.
41:16 - Now, you know, the interesting thing is you only need to prepare once because if
41:21 - let's say that Amazon has 16 leadership principles, if you prepare all the answers
41:27 - for each one of the leadership principles, even tomorrow, if you go to some other
41:31 - company, maybe Microsoft or maybe Google, if they ask some questions, you would
41:36 - still be able to answer even if you didn't prepare.
41:38 - Why?
41:39 - Because these are the common qualities that's going to cover the majority or most
41:46 - common part.
41:47 - So that's why I'm saying that all you need to do the preparation part for behavioral
41:52 - interviews, quite easy and quite simple.
41:55 - All you need to do is just realize what are your strengths, realize where you need
42:00 - to improve, what are your weaknesses, do a self reflection, note down all the
42:05 - experiences and then do the research about the job you are trying to apply and then
42:09 - maybe learn something about the company culture and curate your answer using the
42:13 - star method.
42:14 - Okay.
42:14 - Now let's talk about the different categories of behavioral interview questions.
42:19 - So number one category is teamwork that companies wants to know that how easily
42:25 - and how efficiently can you work within a team and are you like a teamwork kind of
42:31 - person or not?
42:32 - Next one is a problem score solving skills.
42:34 - So if something, some in genuine problem occurs, some unexpected scenario arise, are
42:39 - you able to deal with that or not?
42:41 - Next category is adaptability.
42:43 - Are you able to adapt to a new situation, a new scenario?
42:46 - How easily can you adjust and what are the things you need to do?
42:49 - Next one is the communication and the last category is the leadership.
42:54 - Now leadership category is typically reserved for people higher up in the experience
42:59 - chain, but still, even if you are at the junior level, still, you can be asked some
43:03 - questions regarding leadership and you can give examples based on the small amount of
43:08 - experience you have gained or maybe some of the projects you did outside of your actual
43:13 - job, maybe during your university, you had some initiatives and you can define
43:18 - leadership over there.
43:19 - So there can be different scenarios.
43:21 - Now let's try to understand each category, uh, by its own, by some of the key points
43:26 - that are associated with that category.
43:28 - And then we will start diving deeper into the 50 behavioral questions.
43:33 - So number one category is teamwork and collaboration.
43:36 - Now the companies wants to check that how easily can you cooperate with the person?
43:40 - Uh, are you the person who is open-minded to different scenarios?
43:44 - Do you have the empathy to understand what other person the team is going through?
43:49 - How can you make the best out of the bad situation?
43:51 - How can you take everyone together?
43:53 - Uh, how can others leverage from the work you are doing or how can you leverage the
43:58 - work that others are doing?
44:00 - Uh, can you collaborate with other people or other teams or other members, new
44:05 - members, or maybe some senior fellow, uh, all of these kinds of things they want to
44:09 - ensure next one is the problems are solving skills.
44:12 - So obviously with the rapid change in the world, every single day, new problem
44:18 - arise, or maybe 10 new problems arise, and you need to have the critical thinking
44:23 - to make the changes on top of it.
44:26 - You need to have some sort of creativity in generating the problem or solving the
44:31 - problem, uh, you need rigorous analysis skills to analyze that what is the current
44:37 - situation, what you have done in the past, what have worked, what has not worked.
44:41 - How can you make the best out of the bad situation?
44:43 - How can you convince other stakeholders about the problem?
44:46 - If you have identified some new problems, how, what should be your approach?
44:50 - How can you take on it?
44:51 - If something is much more complicated, very difficult, how would you work upon that?
44:56 - Uh, so there are a lot of things you have to consider and rationally come up with the
45:01 - reasoning in order to solve the problem in the efficient manner.
45:04 - So there would, for sure, there would be some questions regarding the problem
45:08 - solving in your behavioral interview.
45:10 - Next one is the adaptability.
45:12 - Are you a person who is flexible enough to change?
45:15 - Uh, can you be resilient in the face of adversity if there are some completely
45:20 - unexpected items are happening, are you able to come up with that?
45:24 - Uh, if there are new changes, new policies or new rules that you have to abide by,
45:30 - how quickly can you manage them?
45:31 - If you have to learn some new skills, do you have the right attitude to basically
45:36 - take on something completely new that you knew of nothing about and still dive
45:41 - deeper into that and, uh, build the solutions around that new piece of technology
45:47 - because it industry is continuously changing.
45:51 - It's a very frugal industry and everyday new technology or new system or new
45:55 - problems comes in and you have to be adaptable towards solving them.
46:00 - Best example, lock for J everyone knows that the lock for J vulnerability, probably
46:05 - one of the most popular libraries that was used all across world.
46:08 - And suddenly everyone had to change that their version.
46:11 - And then everyone had to be adaptable on how quickly can you change the version?
46:15 - How quickly can you add up the vulnerability?
46:18 - And that raised a lot of questions on, uh, how resilient your systems are?
46:22 - How can you make the, that improvement?
46:24 - How can you significantly change those processes and that sort of thing?
46:28 - And the last one or the second last one is communication, because of course
46:33 - communication is one of the very key skills that you need in order to succeed at your job.
46:38 - I'm not saying that everyone should be proficient in maybe English or French or
46:42 - some other language, whichever language you speak.
46:45 - It doesn't matter.
46:45 - As long as you can convey your thoughts in a profound manner and you are well
46:50 - articulate in sort of the words you use or the way you, uh, communicate
46:56 - with all the different people, you need to be clear, concise in your thought and
47:00 - in your communication, and it should not be vague, generic kind of things.
47:05 - Be specific, be on point, give clear examples.
47:08 - And, uh, that is going to help you tremendous in your career.
47:13 - On top of that, one of the key important parts for any communication skills is
47:18 - actually active listening or mindful listening that you need to be in the
47:22 - moment and understand that what is the exact scenario for that, rather than
47:27 - just proving your point or throwing your point, you will actually have to listen first.
47:31 - And if you develop this ability, it's going to significantly improve your
47:36 - odds in being not only being successful at any interview, but also being
47:41 - successful, greatly successful at your company, because great leaders also
47:45 - tend to be great listeners as well.
47:47 - So make sure you do that.
47:49 - And you are articulate in your thought process and the way
47:52 - you answer different things on top of it, believe it or not, there is always
47:58 - going to be some level of bureaucracy in any different company, and in order to
48:03 - take or come up, come across that you will have to be diplomatic.
48:08 - You will have to understand that what are the trade-offs you can make?
48:10 - What is going to be the give and take in this situation?
48:13 - How can you make the most optimal or most efficient approach?
48:16 - And for that, you need to have some sort of diplomatic personality
48:20 - or diplomacy in your workings, because let's say that you are given two
48:26 - problems and you both seems urgent at the moment, but you can only do one.
48:32 - So which one will you pick?
48:33 - Can you, how can you make that judgment call?
48:36 - What are the constraints you are going to consider?
48:39 - What are going to be your pros and cons for picking one over the other?
48:43 - What is going to make that assumption clear, concise, and how would you communicate
48:49 - that with the team that you are going, you are saying essentially no to that,
48:54 - Hey, I won't be able to work on this right now.
48:56 - How would you be able to communicate that for that?
48:58 - You need the skills of diplomacy and make sure that you work upon that.
49:06 - And last one is leadership.
49:07 - So as I mentioned, leadership is one of the most important qualities
49:11 - because without a strong leader, no company can thrive.
49:16 - And that's why the higher up you are in your experience level and the better
49:21 - sort of positions you are applying for, they're going to be keen on focused on
49:26 - the leadership that how can you help people under you?
49:28 - How can you help with the different responsibilities?
49:31 - Can you handle various portfolios?
49:34 - Can you handle team of different people?
49:37 - Can you handle an individual who is a tough person to handle?
49:40 - How do you promote your team?
49:42 - How do you motivate others?
49:43 - So all of these kinds of things, they're going to come into the picture that can
49:47 - you take new initiatives?
49:49 - Are you going to be a responsible person?
49:51 - Are you going to be accountable for the things that are currently happening?
49:55 - And how can you make it more resilient?
49:56 - What would be your contribution on more promoting others, motivating others?
50:01 - So make sure that you need to have leadership qualities as well.
50:05 - But this vastly depends on the people with higher levels of experience.
50:11 - Okay.
50:11 - So now we are going to talk about the most important topic for this entire course.
50:15 - That is 50 different behavioral interview questions.
50:18 - And we are going to discuss each one of them in a very good detail.
50:21 - Now, before we start diving deeper into the questions, first, let's
50:25 - understand a few things very clearly.
50:27 - Number one, I have taken 10 questions from each of the five different
50:31 - categories that we just talked about, which means you are going to get a
50:35 - comprehensive list of almost all sorts of questions based on all of these five
50:40 - categories.
50:41 - And these are the main categories that you are going to be judged upon because
50:45 - majority of the majority of the companies, they're looking for a specific mindset
50:50 - that is going to be like, uh, involved with different teams.
50:53 - So very good at communication, at leadership, at problems, problem solving,
50:57 - and things like that.
50:58 - So most of the questions would be typically covered by these 50 questions.
51:02 - And even if you might not get the exact same wording as the question, the
51:06 - intent is going to be same.
51:08 - So for each of the questions that we are going to discuss about, I also urge you
51:13 - that at the same time, you also try to create your own answer for each one of
51:17 - the questions.
51:17 - I'm not saying that for all 50 questions, write down the answer and then mug up
51:21 - all the answers, but in your mind, you should have some idea that, Hey, if I
51:25 - encounter this question, this is going to be the story or scenario or experience.
51:30 - I'm going to explain, or if I talk about, or if this is the question, maybe this
51:35 - could be the intent behind the question.
51:37 - So let me frame my answer in that manner.
51:40 - And for each of the questions, once again, go over the list of experiences you have
51:44 - built up on so far, maybe I explained like have somewhere between 10 to 20
51:48 - experiences that are different from each other and that should cover, or that
51:53 - should broadly show the good sides of the things that you have been through.
51:58 - And maybe even if there were some challenging situations, what were you able
52:01 - to learn from that?
52:02 - So have that list ready, create a star formatted bullet points.
52:06 - I'm not saying that have all the entire 45 second answer return on some document
52:11 - because that's, that's going to take a lot of time.
52:13 - Just have some bullet points and be open to discussion and be in the moment.
52:17 - So these are going to be some advices.
52:19 - And last thing I would like to say is that any question you are going to be
52:23 - asked in an interview, be prepared that there are going to be at least three to
52:27 - five follow-ups depending on the interviewer and depending on how depth in
52:32 - depth, the answer you give.
52:33 - So for sure, for any single question they are going to, they must have prepared
52:38 - some follow-up questions that they're going to ask you some follow-up will occur
52:41 - from your own answer.
52:43 - So it's also in your handle and that which direction you want to take your
52:49 - answer or next question into.
52:51 - So you can also tweak that depending on the current answer you give, but more or
52:55 - less be prepared for the follow-up.
52:57 - And once again, I'm giving you an honest opinion.
53:01 - Don't try to fake answers in an interview.
53:04 - If you haven't faced any exact specific situation, just be honest and say that I
53:08 - never had to face this exact situation in my past, but if I have to solve this,
53:14 - this would be my approach.
53:15 - This takes you way further than if you just try to make some random story and
53:20 - then you get caught with the facts and then they ask you follow-ups and you're
53:24 - not able to give the answer and then they would realize that you are essentially
53:28 - bluffing your way into it.
53:29 - Okay.
53:30 - So now I have given you the introduction about what is going to be the format and
53:34 - expectation for these questions.
53:36 - Now let's start with the type of questions.
53:37 - Okay.
53:38 - So number one topic we are going to select is going to be teamwork and collaboration.
53:42 - So let's talk about question.
53:43 - Number one, this is given example of a challenging and successful team project
53:48 - that you were part of, and then for this question prepared for a follow-up question
53:54 - or also it, this can also be part of the same question that what made it successful
53:58 - and what made it challenging.
54:00 - Now, this is a question with a lot of different moving dimensions and perspectives.
54:07 - Number one thing is you need to explain that a type of team project that you are
54:12 - in, so maybe you can give some, some more information about what type of team were
54:16 - there, maybe there were multiple teams involved.
54:18 - What was your contribution?
54:20 - What were you trying to achieve?
54:22 - Next, you need to focus on the challenging part.
54:24 - So that what was the challenging scenario for this type of exact experience
54:30 - that you are describing, maybe there were tight deadlines, maybe there were some
54:35 - existing product issues that needed to be fixed on an immediate basis.
54:39 - Maybe there was some priority, one or priority to incident that happened and
54:43 - that needs to be resolved in the moment for, and in order to resolve that many
54:47 - teams are working, maybe there is a threat coming from the outside and you
54:51 - have to deal with it if not the company is essentially losing money every single
54:55 - day.
54:56 - So there can be many different challenges for any particular projects.
54:59 - Maybe there is a challenge related to tech stack.
55:02 - Maybe there is a challenge related to number of resources.
55:05 - Maybe you don't have sufficient technology.
55:07 - Maybe you don't have sufficient amount of money that you can spend for the project.
55:11 - And then you have to make the choices according to that.
55:13 - There are a lot of different challenging situations, but now on top of being a
55:17 - challenging situation, you will also have to explain that how was it a successful
55:22 - project?
55:23 - So typical definitions of subject success is on time and on budget.
55:28 - These are two, these tend to be the standard definition, but on top of it, in
55:33 - order for a successful team, team project, you can also explain that.
55:36 - How did your team learn from that?
55:38 - How did you complete it?
55:39 - That how did you change the ways of how things happens in your company?
55:43 - And this became like a framework for all the subsequent projects.
55:48 - So this, this was in itself and key inception project in your journey.
55:53 - This can be a very good question to ask at the beginning, because this is going to open
55:57 - up so many different questions and so many different follow ups.
56:00 - Plus it will give you a great contribution, great way to shine as well.
56:05 - For sure.
56:06 - After this question, they are going to focus more on that.
56:08 - What were the responsibilities of the team?
56:10 - What were your responsibilities?
56:11 - What were raw your contribution?
56:13 - So always, whenever you are giving answer related to teamwork or different team
56:17 - projects, make sure that you clearly define the distinction of what was your
56:23 - specific duties, because they are only interested in your attitude, your
56:27 - behavior, and the things you had to do and things you learn.
56:30 - So you can give the broad example of the whole scenario and then start putting
56:34 - more emphasis on what you were responsible for.
56:37 - And how did you behave in this situation?
56:39 - Okay.
56:39 - Now let's go to the second question that is, tell me a time when you had to deal
56:43 - with a difficult client or a difficult coworker.
56:46 - So once again, the question is open to interpretation, difficult client,
56:49 - difficult coworker, you can give an example of each one of them.
56:53 - This is a very common scenario.
56:54 - Maybe you are working in a company or where you are directly dealing with the
56:58 - client, or you are in some sort of consultant position.
57:01 - So you, you have to work with a lot of different companies or vendors or
57:05 - engagements, and maybe something happened.
57:08 - Why were, why the client was being difficult?
57:11 - What was the overall scenario?
57:13 - You need to explain all of these things.
57:15 - Now let me first give you an example of a difficult client.
57:18 - Then I'll give you an example for the difficult, difficult coworker.
57:21 - Okay.
57:22 - For the difficult client, you can talk about that, uh, what made them trigger.
57:26 - Maybe they were unhappy with your company from the beforehand.
57:30 - Maybe they didn't like the products of your company.
57:32 - Maybe they had some competitor who was providing a better deal.
57:35 - Maybe you are not responding to their queries.
57:38 - So you can say that, yeah, this was the difficult situation.
57:41 - The client was not personally difficult towards you, but overall, this was a
57:45 - situation and they were not willing to, uh, move forward with the solution.
57:50 - So the approach can be that you explained, you reached out to them.
57:53 - You try to listen that what were their exact concerns, you gave them a timeframe
57:58 - on the potential fixes and make sure that you, you stayed on that timeframe
58:03 - and you committed towards that.
58:04 - And in the end, you were able to finally come up with a solution.
58:07 - This can be a way to deal with any difficult client or core client.
58:12 - And in order to deal with a difficult coworker, of course,
58:16 - this is a very common scenario.
58:18 - Now for the difficult coworker, you will have to understand that why the coworker
58:22 - is being difficult towards you.
58:24 - Maybe that person is just the way that they are, that they're always behaving
58:29 - like that with everyone else, or is there any specific bias against you or they are
58:34 - just being mean towards you.
58:35 - So make sure that that is the case.
58:37 - If that is the case, always before taking any further steps or actions, just make
58:43 - sure that you reach and speak with the coworker, try to understand their
58:46 - concerns, why they are, um, why you feel that they're being difficult towards you.
58:51 - And in my opinion, this should be, this should mostly close out all the
58:55 - differences that you might had.
58:57 - So maybe this can be a great way to move forward.
59:00 - And if not, you can also try to involve your manager or project manager if things
59:05 - get to that level, but needless to say, so this can be your answer in order
59:09 - to explain this type of scenario.
59:12 - Now let's move on to the next question.
59:14 - Can you describe a time when you had to deal with a team member
59:17 - who wasn't pulling their weight?
59:19 - So I actually faced this kind of situation in one of my previous roles.
59:23 - And I can give you my experience.
59:25 - So we were working on a project and, uh, we realized that one of the, uh, one
59:29 - of the other developers, they were not fulfilling their commitments towards
59:34 - the task that they were being assigned to.
59:36 - And then that was causing a strain on the existing project.
59:39 - So it, that developer was reasonably good.
59:43 - Like there were no issues with him, but suddenly he started doing that.
59:47 - So I reached out to him.
59:48 - I asked him, Hey, what is the issue?
59:51 - Is that something wrong that is going on?
59:53 - Um, why you are not able to do that?
59:55 - And I asked that, asked that in a personal meeting.
59:58 - And I realized that, uh, one of very close family members of that particular
60:03 - coworker was actually really sick and, um, was in a very critical
60:09 - condition in the hospital.
60:11 - So that coworker was pretty stressed about that situation of that family
60:16 - member, maybe, um, like fighting for the life and death in the hospital.
60:21 - And that was causing him all sorts of anxiety issues.
60:24 - Plus, uh, because that family member staying in the hospital, the
60:28 - overall responsibilities were way too much.
60:30 - He will have to, he had to manage everything at home and then everything
60:33 - at the hospital and then traveling here and there and medicines and, uh,
60:36 - extra expenses and whatnot.
60:38 - So I learned that this was the situation I asked him that do you want me to speak
60:44 - with the project manager or a team manager?
60:46 - And he was like, yeah, maybe we can talk about it.
60:48 - We discussed the situation and the managers were like, you take couple of
60:53 - weeks off, don't worry about the work.
60:55 - Just take care of your family.
60:56 - Uh, nothing comes more important.
60:59 - So they gave him that, that freedom on our side, like all, all of us, our team
61:05 - members, we distributed the work that that coworker was doing, and then
61:10 - we dealt with that situation.
61:12 - Now the thing is the first instinct for us was to blame everything that this
61:17 - person is not able to do the work.
61:19 - But we realized that there was a very specific reason that why they were not
61:23 - able to pull up, pull their weight because they were under this, this
61:28 - unexpected scenario.
61:29 - And then once that coworker came back, he was pretty happy that the team
61:33 - supported him in that hardship time.
61:35 - And then once the things resolved that employee was back on the performance.
61:40 - So this, this was a really good learning experience that many times if you just
61:44 - communicate well, you, you might understand and many times you might not
61:48 - know the whole story on why things are the way they are.
61:52 - So always try to find the, that exact thing or exact reason first, before you
61:59 - start judging them, or you start taking harsher or more stricter actions or where
62:03 - you start to escalate things.
62:06 - Okay.
62:06 - So this was, this can be one of the examples.
62:09 - So this is how I would give the answer, maybe like slightly shorter, not so long,
62:14 - but you get the idea, right?
62:16 - Same way you can also create your own, your own experience, your own story.
62:21 - How would you deal with it?
62:22 - If the team, you realize that the team member after having many communications
62:27 - still is not pulling their weight and still being lazy or slacker, then you
62:32 - might have to escalate the issue.
62:33 - You might have to take some responsibilities off of them because you
62:37 - don't want to jeopardize the project just because one team member is not doing
62:42 - their job.
62:42 - Okay.
62:43 - Next is how do you handle the situation where you had to disagree with a supervisor?
62:47 - Again, this is going to be one of the most popular questions.
62:51 - Most of the interviews I have been asked this question.
62:54 - So that's why you also sort of be prepared for this.
62:58 - Well, essentially whenever you have a disagreement with your supervisor,
63:02 - manager, project manager, anyone number one, what was the reason?
63:06 - What, where does the disagreement lies?
63:09 - So the example could be that maybe we were trying to build out a new product
63:14 - or a new project suddenly the company at that time had demanded that everything
63:19 - should be built in the cloud.
63:20 - And we were trying to migrate from on premises to the cloud, but this new
63:24 - product that we were trying to build on that, that needed to be done in a very
63:28 - quick manner, and if we had to go through the cloud native route, maybe it would
63:32 - have taken us longer time.
63:34 - So that's why manager was like, uh, do this right now, deploy it on the on premises.
63:39 - And then maybe we can start thinking about cloud later.
63:42 - So that was sort of the, uh, approach from the manager on your side.
63:47 - You can say that you were proposed.
63:48 - You were suggesting that rather than doing double the effort, maybe you can
63:53 - just build it one time and have it cloud native enabled.
63:57 - So this is where the agreement light, this was a situation.
63:59 - The background was company wanted this thing.
64:01 - Your manager wanted the product to ship out fast in the fastest manner.
64:05 - You wanted it to be done properly by deploying into the cloud.
64:09 - So this was the disagreement.
64:12 - How did you handle the situation?
64:13 - Maybe you had a communication with the, with your manager.
64:16 - You explain the pros and cons, or you walk together on the pros and cons of
64:21 - these, each situation, you realize that what was his or her point of view?
64:25 - What is, what was your point of view?
64:27 - Uh, you put both the things on the scale and then with a common consensus, you
64:33 - came to a conclusion that, okay, this, this would be the correct path forward.
64:37 - And we agree on this.
64:39 - And then you move forward and you implemented the solution.
64:42 - And then what was the result?
64:43 - You can just explain that.
64:44 - So this is a very good example of you conveying that you are thinking about
64:49 - what is going to be the best in the long run.
64:51 - You are also thinking about that.
64:53 - If you have a disagreement with your manager, how you are going to approach
64:56 - that, how you are going to convey your pros and cons for each one of the things.
65:00 - And what is your thought process or your mechanism to come up with the most ideal
65:05 - solution that is going to be in agreement with all the available stakeholders.
65:10 - So this can be a great, uh, questions, a question to ask in an interview
65:14 - as well, and expect that this question might be somewhere around the line.
65:17 - Okay.
65:18 - Next one is describe when you had to use your understanding to lead a team again.
65:23 - Now, the question is, this is on the leadership side as well.
65:26 - Also working with the team as well.
65:29 - So if you are already applying for like a leadership position, this question
65:33 - is very evident, they wanted to understand that what are your team leadership abilities.
65:38 - Next thing is maybe if you're not applying for a team leadership position, but still
65:42 - they want to understand that if you are in a position where you might have to lead
65:46 - a group of people or different team, what would, what would be your approach?
65:50 - So once again, you can think of a scenario that why did you had to lead the team?
65:54 - How did you started leading the team?
65:56 - What was your understanding of understanding of, of each one of the team members?
66:01 - How would you, how did you approach them?
66:03 - How did you approach the conflicting views?
66:05 - How did you approach the conflicting priorities?
66:07 - Uh, how did you approach or how did you convey each one of them to stay motivated?
66:13 - So these are all the dimensions that are going to be asked for this question.
66:17 - So for sure, you can think of a scenario where maybe you might not be leading the
66:23 - team, but suddenly you realize that one of your coworkers, they were out on a holiday
66:27 - or vacation who tend to be at a senior position.
66:30 - And then now you are in a situation where you had to get this task done with the
66:36 - priority basis.
66:37 - So how did you convince her that how did you reach out to different teams?
66:40 - How did you convey the result to the stakeholders and how did you keep the
66:44 - communication going on, on top of it, staying up to date on the task that you
66:49 - are trying to finish.
66:49 - Okay.
66:50 - So explain like this, and it would be, it would look really good for your answer.
66:56 - Next question is, uh, can you talk about a time when you had to coordinate with
67:01 - different departments to complete a project?
67:04 - Once again, pretty standard question.
67:06 - And always in many projects, you are going to always going to be working with many
67:11 - different teams simultaneously, because some team is working on transaction, like
67:16 - half part of the transaction, you might be working on the other half.
67:19 - There might be some other team who is working on the third part and whatnot.
67:23 - So how did you keep the communication alive?
67:25 - What are your points of context?
67:27 - How do you do some collaborative activities?
67:29 - How do you build trust between the different teams?
67:32 - If there is any problem arises, how do you deal with different teams?
67:36 - Uh, how do you note down everything?
67:37 - How do you keep track of things?
67:39 - How do you keep track of timetable?
67:41 - Uh, what are going to be your responsibilities, uh, working cross-functionally
67:45 - with the team, if there are conflicting priorities, how you are going to keep
67:50 - track of that?
67:50 - So these are all the things that you can think of considering.
67:53 - Now, next question is tell me about a time when you had to rely on your
67:57 - presentation skills to influence someone's opinion.
68:01 - So maybe you might be in a sales type position where you have to sell something
68:06 - or you have to convince a client to maybe buy your product or, uh, understand
68:11 - the importance of the product.
68:12 - So that, that is where your presentations and skills can come into play.
68:16 - Maybe you find some technical issue in your existing system and you can, you need
68:21 - to explain that situation to all the other stakeholders in the existing company.
68:25 - So even though the thing might be technical, but many times you might have
68:29 - to explain the situation to, to some business level, people who are not so
68:33 - technical, maybe you have to explain it to your junior team who might not have
68:38 - all the entire idea of the whole ecosystem or whole project.
68:41 - So depending on what type of stakeholder you are trying to explain, your
68:45 - presentation needs to change and the way you are going to approach the
68:48 - things also needs to change.
68:50 - So if you explain like this, that for, in order to solve one problem, you have
68:56 - to present the solutions to three different teams in three different ways.
69:00 - And this are going to be approaches for each one of them.
69:03 - And this is how you are going to convey them that this is why we need to do this.
69:07 - And if they decide to do it, if you have some sort of like example, like this in
69:11 - your past, maybe this can be a great question to showcase that not only you
69:16 - think, think depending on who you are speaking with, you are also coming up with
69:22 - different approaches and different solutions based on the person you are
69:26 - speaking with or the, the problem you are trying to solve.
69:28 - So that's a great skill to have and any company would want a person to be, to
69:34 - have that, that type of attitude.
69:36 - Next question is describe a situation where you had to resolve
69:39 - an interpersonal conflict at work.
69:42 - So if there is a conflict going on between two members of the team, how would
69:46 - you resolve that if you realize that there is a conflict going on between
69:50 - two different teams, because many times like the two teams had to work really
69:55 - close, but also when an issue happens, there is a lot of finger pointing
69:58 - between both the teams and that's why they, they might have some disgruntled
70:03 - previous experience that they have some issues going on between those two teams.
70:08 - And that amongst these type of scenarios, how would you approach it?
70:14 - If you have that, that experience in your past, always feel free to throw out.
70:18 - If you don't have that experience, you can also say that I have never personally
70:22 - experienced this, but if I experienced a situation or a question like this, my
70:27 - approach would be to first realize that what is the root cause of problem, why
70:31 - they are being hostile or in disagreement with each other, or why it feels like there
70:38 - is always a conflict going on.
70:40 - And then once you realize the root of the problem, you start to eradicate that
70:45 - problem and start to work upon the solution.
70:47 - So that can be one of the good, good approaches to take on the question like this.
70:51 - Next one is how do you approach working in a diverse and inclusive environment?
70:56 - Now this question is like a free hit or like a, an open goal or penalty goal like
71:02 - that for sure, the real simple fact is diverse and inclusive teams are always
71:10 - going to be far more superior than a single type of teams.
71:14 - And there is a very clear study for that.
71:16 - Let me give you an example back in like sixties or seventies, when the, the team
71:21 - where they start the auto manufacturing company, they started building these
71:27 - dummy models that would be put in the cars and then cars would be placed in a, in
71:32 - a crash like scenario.
71:34 - So the purpose was to see that how would the dummies behave and they wanted to
71:38 - make cars safer and safer.
71:40 - Now, initially at that point of time, all the engineers or all the scientists who
71:45 - were working on building the dummies, they created a dummy based on a male
71:50 - European average person.
71:53 - So the dummy was in terms of height, shape dimensions was treated as if that,
72:01 - that person would be like a European average European male.
72:06 - What it turned out is because of this, and this was not an intentional thing.
72:10 - This was just a random consensus.
72:12 - They came up with, uh, because all the, most of the group of scientists were male
72:16 - European, and they thought that this is a common body type that every human on the
72:21 - world has, so they started creating, building the dummies.
72:25 - Then they started testing the cars against all those crash collision scenarios and
72:30 - realize that, okay, these are the safety features that cars have to adopt because
72:33 - this is what we experienced based on the dummies, just because of that one bias.
72:39 - Despite cars having those added extra features, it was not safe for children.
72:45 - It was not safe for women.
72:46 - It was not safe for, uh, people from different places of the world, maybe like
72:51 - Asian people or African people or something like that.
72:54 - So even though they were trying to do a good thing, a very noble thing, but just
72:59 - because while considering the crash dummies, they did not consider the whole
73:04 - ecosystem of different people and different types of, uh, humans that are
73:08 - present, they ended up being the reason for a lot of deaths.
73:12 - Of course, they saved a lot of people.
73:14 - I'm not saying that their work does not send any value, but had they had more
73:20 - inclusive team, maybe there were like more women, maybe there were people from
73:24 - different parts of the world, I'm pretty sure someone would have said at that
73:28 - time that, Hey, instead of creating a dummy like this, why don't we create
73:32 - four different types of dummies to represent more set of people.
73:35 - And then we can do all of these tasty, like safety tests on, on the cars.
73:42 - And that would have saved a lot, many lives.
73:45 - So this is why if you give like this example in your interview, your
73:50 - interview will start crying because it's a, it's a true story on how an inclusive
73:55 - team can make a significant difference in a project or a product or the thing
74:00 - you are trying to build because everyone has different backgrounds.
74:03 - Everyone has different experiences, different ways that they grew up.
74:06 - Maybe they belong to different company countries, cultures, uh, different
74:10 - ethnicities, different colors, their perspective are going to be golden.
74:15 - If you have someone in a company who thinks like me, then why do you have that
74:21 - person, if both things are thinking alike, then there is something wrong
74:24 - of keeping both things in both people.
74:27 - So that's why always, whenever you think you see anything about diversity and
74:32 - inclusion, always, always be on the forefront, be the, be an inclusive person
74:37 - that that always makes the world a better place.
74:40 - Now, next thing is, can you do me an example of how you motivated others?
74:45 - So if I have to give this example, I can give in couple of ways.
74:49 - Maybe I can talk about a time where, uh, I had to work on a project and, uh, we
74:53 - were working against tight deadlines.
74:55 - And then we realized that we were short staff.
74:58 - So I reached, I found these interns at my company and the
75:01 - interns were recently joined.
75:03 - So I reached out to the, to the interns that, Hey, if you want to work on
75:06 - something cool, because they had the time and resource at their hand, but they
75:09 - did not had the direction.
75:11 - And then I reached out to management that, Hey, I have, I have found these
75:14 - people, they are willing to work with me.
75:17 - Uh, can I have your permission?
75:18 - And once doing that, I started teaching them, helping them, motivating them on
75:22 - what we are trying to do.
75:23 - And once we achieved the whole thing as a result, I received my promotion and all
75:28 - the interns, they received like full-time hire offer from the company
75:32 - that we were working for.
75:33 - And this is a true story.
75:34 - So this is a great way.
75:36 - I just motivated them because I explained them that this is a new
75:39 - thing that we are trying to do.
75:40 - It has major impact.
75:42 - It is going to be important from the company's perspective.
75:44 - Plus it is a really nice skill to learn.
75:46 - And by doing so, you will gain much more real life experience on how things
75:51 - happens and how things are operating at a team.
75:54 - Plus I gained experience on mentoring different people and creating more friendships.
76:00 - So that was a win-win for everyone.
76:02 - And this was my example.
76:03 - So this, this can, this can be one of the ways I can say I have
76:07 - motivated others, maybe you could have motivated someone else in some different
76:11 - fashion, maybe to take that leap in their career, maybe to take that leap in the
76:17 - new technology or new thing that they are, they are trying to build.
76:20 - Maybe help them to motivate them to become healthier in the, in their life, even
76:24 - though it's not technical still, it is motivating other people to do something
76:28 - nice for themselves that can have lasting impact.
76:31 - So anything like this, you can explain in, in your situation.
76:35 - Okay.
76:35 - Now let's talk about the second category that is problem solving.
76:39 - And let's see question.
76:40 - Number 11, describe a project where you had to use your problem solving skills.
76:45 - So for this question, number one thing is why did you had to use your
76:50 - problem, self-solving skills?
76:51 - What were the problem you were trying to solve?
76:53 - Maybe it was a technical problem.
76:55 - Maybe, maybe it was a mathematical problem that no one had solution to.
76:59 - Maybe it was a problem with different attitudes and shifting priorities where
77:04 - you had to be really creative in order to find the best path forward and bring
77:09 - everyone into the consensus.
77:12 - So all of these things you can think about as why you had to be in that situation.
77:18 - And after realizing this tricky situation, what solution you came up with, how did
77:22 - you use the problem solving approach?
77:25 - How did you convince other that your solution is correct?
77:28 - And then what was the end result you achieve?
77:30 - So this can be a pretty good way to explain that.
77:32 - How do you think on different aspects and different scenarios?
77:36 - Okay.
77:37 - Next one is tell me about a time when you made a mistake and how did you handle it?
77:42 - No one in their careers move forward without making many mistakes.
77:46 - So always make sure that you must have made some mistakes at some point in time.
77:51 - Then explain that what was the mistake you made?
77:54 - Why did you made that?
77:55 - Maybe you did not have enough background knowledge.
77:57 - Maybe you did not had experience.
77:59 - Maybe you did not learn how to do that.
78:01 - Maybe the person teaching, you also didn't realize that how this can be one of the
78:05 - odd case scenario where this, this issue can happen.
78:08 - What was the impact of the mistake?
78:10 - How did you own the mistake where you be like, yeah, I'm accountable for my mistakes.
78:15 - This is my approach and this is how I take, this is what I did.
78:19 - Now let me do this to fix it.
78:21 - And did you fix it after fixing it?
78:23 - What did you learn?
78:24 - How did you convince others not to make the same mistake?
78:27 - So these are all the things that you can think about while creating an answer for
78:32 - how like, tell me about a time when you had to handle a mistake.
78:35 - Okay.
78:36 - Next one is describe a situation where you had to be particularly attentive to
78:41 - details.
78:41 - How did you handle that?
78:43 - Once again, now you will start seeing a pattern about all the questions that we
78:47 - are discussing that whenever you say that you have to be particularly attentive.
78:51 - Number one question, why did you had to be attentive?
78:55 - Maybe it was a very critical thing.
78:57 - Maybe you are working with sensitive data.
78:59 - Maybe you are working on a sensitive product, critical timelines.
79:03 - Maybe you or your, or your team had already tried to do this and you already
79:10 - failed like couple of times.
79:11 - So this time you have to make sure that this was the way, this was the way you
79:16 - have to move forward so you have to make sure that you don't make any mistakes.
79:19 - After explaining the scenario now, how did you ensure that you are being
79:24 - particularly attentive?
79:26 - Maybe you can do like that after completing the whole thing you did a couple of
79:30 - times extra reviews to make sure you did not miss something.
79:33 - Maybe you try to use some automated tools to realize that what you are
79:37 - suggesting is correct or not.
79:39 - Maybe you had it peer reviewed.
79:41 - Maybe you reached out to your manager for the feedback.
79:44 - Maybe you reached out to the team for the feedback before presenting it to a
79:47 - broader audience or started starting to build solutions based on that.
79:51 - So these are the things you can display disclose about them.
79:55 - Next is, can you talk about a time when you had to persuade others to see
80:00 - the things your way, why you had to persuade others?
80:05 - That is the background.
80:06 - And now you understand the point of whole questions.
80:09 - Okay.
80:10 - Why did you had to persuade others?
80:12 - What were their approach and how your approach was different, how your approach
80:16 - was going to be more sensible compared to the other ones?
80:20 - How did you explain that to them?
80:22 - So this can be a way where you can show, showcase your presentation skills, your
80:27 - persuasion abilities, your thinking abilities of thinking outside the box,
80:33 - treating the problem in a different manner.
80:35 - So same way, like American astronauts, they build these like zero gravity
80:41 - pens that despite costing million dollars, it can write at any angle.
80:46 - But then Russian scientists, they, they only use pencils.
80:49 - It was a like 50 cent solution.
80:52 - And they saved millions of dollars.
80:53 - So this can be a different ways of different solutions for the same problem.
80:58 - Okay.
80:59 - So now let next, let's go to the next question.
81:02 - Tell me about a time when you showed initiative at work.
81:05 - So initiative can be anything initiative can be that maybe you showed an
81:10 - initiative to create a new social activity at a company, maybe you created
81:15 - like a new, new tradition at the company.
81:19 - Maybe you created a new group of like parents of highly capable children in
81:25 - your company, and then you, now you have like 500 members and they all share that
81:30 - what do they do so that they can make their children highly capable.
81:33 - And now you have created a great initiative for the diversity and inclusion and
81:38 - also like overall social, social connection of the, of the company.
81:43 - So that these, these are all parts of the initiatives.
81:46 - Next, there can be initiatives related related to technical stuff that maybe
81:50 - you were an on-premise company, you took the initiative that the next product
81:54 - we are trying to build, let's build it in the cloud and let's see that how,
81:57 - what should be our approach, how cheap it is, how effective it is, or maybe you
82:02 - already have an existing ongoing system.
82:04 - You try to change some like alerting mechanism.
82:07 - You try to bring in automation DevOps to the existing framework.
82:12 - And that ended up saving a lot of time, but it still took some initial time to
82:16 - build up and then you, you sort of took it upon yourself with along with few
82:21 - other people to be in that like initiate initiation phase to get the things
82:26 - rolling and start working on the thing.
82:28 - So this can be a really good approach.
82:30 - Next is describe a situation where you had to take the lead on a project.
82:35 - So this is very similar to a previous question we already discussed, but once
82:38 - again, where did you, like, why did you had to take the lead?
82:42 - What was the scenario?
82:43 - How did you took the lead?
82:45 - Maybe there was a problem, specific problem you are trying to solve.
82:48 - And then you put some extra attention in order to achieve that result.
82:52 - Maybe some person left the company, some new project came in, some conflicting
82:58 - priorities happen, and then you are in the position at the right place in the
83:01 - right time and without passing the button to the, to someone else and saying
83:07 - that, Hey, this is not my responsibility.
83:08 - Someone else's responsibility.
83:10 - You took that initiative and you rose up to the situation.
83:13 - You are like, no, let me take care of this project.
83:15 - And I'm going to, uh, I'm going to do this and I'm going to convince
83:19 - others to do it along with me.
83:22 - So this, this can be a way to show your problem solving skills
83:26 - and your leadership abilities.
83:28 - Next one is, can you give me an example of a time when you went above
83:32 - and beyond your job duties?
83:34 - Now, this is a tricky question.
83:35 - When you talk about above and beyond your job duties, number one, of course,
83:39 - you want to give some examples, maybe some project or product you are really
83:43 - passionate about and you are working on it for six months that was coming close
83:47 - to the deadline of launching to the production.
83:49 - So during that time you had to put really extra focus and attention to make sure
83:54 - that you go through the production launch or release in successful manner.
83:59 - So for that, you might walk like two weeks for like 12 hour days.
84:04 - And then, uh, in the end, you made sure that the whole release was successful.
84:07 - And then you are really happy with all the progress you made.
84:10 - And maybe it was really beneficial to the company.
84:12 - So that's a, that's a good, a good way to acknowledge the
84:15 - scenario of going above above and beyond.
84:18 - But if you, if you see a scenario where for like continuously six months,
84:23 - every single day you had to work like 12 or 14 hour days in order to complete a
84:27 - work, of course you are going above and beyond, but this is not a sustainable way.
84:32 - Now you are killing yourself.
84:33 - You are burning out.
84:35 - You are being less productive.
84:37 - Uh, despite putting more hours, you are slowly and slowly reducing your
84:42 - efficiency and you are not maintaining the work-life balance.
84:45 - So you are going to build up that resentment towards the company eventually.
84:49 - So always be careful about what intensity you define above and beyond.
84:56 - Okay.
84:57 - Now let's go to the next one.
84:59 - Tell me about a time when you had to innovate to solve a problem.
85:03 - Once again, why did you had to innovate?
85:05 - What type of problem it was.
85:07 - This question is more about the problem being so in genuine that
85:11 - you have to innovate something.
85:13 - And what was your innovation?
85:16 - Uh, how did you make things easy?
85:18 - How did you fix it?
85:20 - And so yeah, the world is your oyster in this, this question.
85:24 - So make sure like, uh, think about your experiences, uh, and come
85:30 - up with, come up with some solution for that.
85:31 - Okay.
85:32 - Next one is describe a time when you had to make tough decisions quickly.
85:36 - How do you make tough decisions?
85:38 - Uh, why the decision was tough?
85:40 - Maybe a tough example of tough decision is you might have to let someone go layoffs.
85:46 - That's a very tough decision.
85:47 - It can take toll on any manager.
85:49 - Like no one wants to see lives being destroyed, but you have to take it.
85:54 - Otherwise the company would go under that can be a tough decision.
85:57 - Maybe there can be a tough decision where there is a severity, one production
86:02 - issue going on, and you have to decide that are you going to fix it right away?
86:07 - In which you might have to tweak some rules that you, that your company has set
86:11 - up, or you are going to go through the complete path that is going to take maybe
86:15 - like a couple of hours extra.
86:17 - So the solution would be there, but still for those couple of hours, companies
86:22 - continuously losing money.
86:24 - So how do you make that decision?
86:25 - How do you do the calculated risk?
86:28 - What is your approach?
86:29 - How do you keep the oral team engaged?
86:31 - So think about these things and come up with your own answers.
86:35 - Okay.
86:35 - Next one is how do you approach learning a new skills or technology?
86:39 - Provide an example.
86:41 - Now change is the only constant in it world.
86:45 - Every single year or every couple of years, new technologies come in, new
86:49 - libraries come in, new tech stack, new problems, new threats from the outside
86:57 - entities, whatnot.
86:58 - So you are always, always, always going to be learning.
87:01 - Now, when this question is being asked, it's not more about that.
87:05 - How do you learn it?
87:06 - It's about your approach towards learning for learning something new.
87:12 - So your art of learning for learning a new skill, that is what you have to
87:17 - explain, and you can give a lot of examples.
87:20 - Maybe you had to some for any particular project or product, you have to learn a
87:25 - new language, maybe you jump companies in your past and where in one company you are
87:29 - working on, maybe like AWS on the other company, you are working on Azure.
87:33 - So you had to learn, relearn the whole thing from scratch.
87:37 - So that there can be many examples.
87:39 - Just make sure that you are being a humble towards your approach on learning.
87:44 - What are the different tools you take on and how do you reach out to different
87:48 - people in the team who might be junior to you, but still you put your ego on the
87:53 - side and you, you go to them then.
87:55 - And you ask that, Hey, I don't know about this thing.
87:57 - Can you teach me?
87:58 - Can you explain me what should be the potential solution?
88:00 - So you can talk about it.
88:01 - Now let's move on to the next category and that is adaptability.
88:05 - So for that first, let's see that.
88:07 - Tell me about a time when you had to adopt a significant change in the workplace.
88:12 - What was the significant change?
88:14 - Why the change was came into the place?
88:15 - Maybe one of the significant change can be that previously, let's assume that all
88:20 - the deployments are being done manually in like dev QA, UAT, and production
88:24 - environment, and suddenly company came up with a mandate that starting from next
88:28 - month, everything has to be automated with CICD, you cannot do anything manual.
88:34 - And this is a big change.
88:35 - You are not used to it.
88:36 - Plus on top of it, you, you will have to deal with your existing workload.
88:39 - Plus you will have to deal with this new CICD pipeline that you will have to build.
88:44 - So how would, how would you deal with it?
88:46 - How would you convince other team members to take part of, take part into this?
88:50 - So understand like this can be one of the examples, but you can, you are
88:54 - free to create your own example.
88:56 - Next one is describe a situation where you had to gather
88:58 - information from multiple sources.
89:01 - How did you determine which information is most relevant?
89:05 - This is a very common scenario because many like long running projects, they
89:11 - might have many versions of documentation and the current reality would be
89:18 - completely different than what is written in all of those documentations,
89:22 - because at some point someone just stop updating the documentation.
89:26 - So now you have one copy that says that, Hey, things ABC are correct.
89:30 - You have another copy that says that things XYZ is correct.
89:34 - And maybe you have some senior developer who says that, no, the whole
89:37 - thing is actually one, two, three.
89:39 - It's not even alphabets.
89:40 - So how do you correlate amongst all of these information?
89:44 - So the question is, first of all, you try to regroup the whole, all the different
89:48 - information, see that what are the different points, reach out to different
89:51 - people in the team who might have that idea that why the things are, are there
89:55 - the way they are, if you are still stuck and still not able to find any solution,
90:00 - maybe start digging into the code base, use some online tools on like compilers
90:07 - that can run through or iterate through the code and create these dependency
90:11 - graphs, see that what are the database being connected, how the transactions
90:15 - are flowing through and then reverse engineer that project and create
90:20 - the documentation for that.
90:21 - I know it's a much longer path, but eventually it has to be taken at some
90:26 - point, if you want to maintain the clear set of instructions.
90:29 - And then implement or create policies in the company that this type of
90:34 - situation does not occur in the future.
90:36 - So now you are maintaining the updated in relevant information and what should
90:40 - be your approach moving forward.
90:42 - So this can be a good example to explain.
90:45 - Next one is, can you talk about a time when you had to work under pressure?
90:48 - Once again, why you had to work under pressure, where you're fighting against
90:53 - tight deadlines, where you understaff under resource, where you're working
90:57 - on some critical project, where you're working on some production issues
91:00 - that needed to be fixed immediately.
91:02 - Did you miss some deadlines?
91:04 - Why did this happen?
91:06 - So, and then what was our approach working under pressure?
91:10 - Do you realize that despite situation is intense, do you want to lose your productivity?
91:16 - No.
91:17 - So how, what should be our approach?
91:18 - How would you move forward?
91:20 - What are the things you would take into the consideration?
91:23 - How would you help others in that situation?
91:26 - How do you keep the communication channels alive?
91:28 - And how do you calm yourself?
91:30 - How do, what do you say to yourself that, Hey, uh, we will get through this.
91:34 - Let me think it like a rational person without having so much of all of these
91:39 - anxiety and panics in order to complete that.
91:41 - Okay.
91:42 - Next one is how do you handle meeting tight deadlines?
91:45 - I mean, everyone must have experienced this at some point.
91:48 - If you are, if you have some tight deadlines coming up, make sure that you
91:53 - prioritize the current work you have.
91:55 - If you have too much work on your plate, feel free to delegate that work.
91:58 - Or if you cannot meet the deadline, convey beforehand to the consumers that
92:02 - why you are not able to meet it, what are the reasonings, what are going
92:05 - to be the new timelines, always assess that where your current project is,
92:10 - where it is heading, what are the timelines you predicted, where you are,
92:14 - and what should be your next, next step forward.
92:16 - So if you continuously do that, I don't think you would be in a situation
92:20 - where out of the blue, your project is like now one month delay in the, in
92:24 - terms of deadlines, so it would very rarely happens if you already have
92:28 - all of these things present, so make sure to convey that.
92:31 - Okay.
92:32 - Next one is describe a time when you had to learn something new in short period.
92:37 - How did you manage?
92:37 - I mean, this is just a different version of a previous question we discussed.
92:41 - So once again, if you have to learn something in like very short time, what
92:45 - is going to be the shortest way you can start learning about maybe you reach
92:48 - out to different people and just re just start learning the relevant information.
92:52 - And instead of going through the whole thing, try to fix it first and then go
92:56 - deeper into learning the whole thing as it on its own, so that this can be one
93:01 - of the approaches.
93:02 - Okay.
93:02 - Now let's move on to the next topic.
93:04 - That is the topic of adaptability.
93:06 - How do you ensure that you are adaptable?
93:09 - Once again, we are continuing on the same topic.
93:11 - Now, next one is tell me about a time when you had to adapt your communication
93:16 - style to suit a particular audience.
93:18 - Now this goes back to the previous question we discussed
93:21 - regarding presentation skills.
93:23 - Once again, if you are trying to solve a technical problem, but if you will have
93:27 - to explain it to a business person, you will have to use different terminology.
93:32 - You will have to explain that what is going to be the cost from the business
93:35 - standpoint cost as in number of people working number of time, what are going
93:40 - to be the resources you are going to using in like maybe cloud or on premises
93:45 - in terms of servers and networking components and whatnot.
93:48 - If you are speaking with some technical or developer, you are going to be talking
93:52 - about how the packets are going to be transferred, what are the database
93:56 - schema going to be, how we are going to store the data, how we are going to
93:59 - secure all the data, what are the GDPR compliance you are going to follow, whatnot.
94:03 - If you are explaining this to a scrum master, you will just explain that,
94:07 - Hey, these are the tasks we need to do.
94:09 - These should be the timelines.
94:11 - These should be the sequencing of the task.
94:13 - This is the purpose of each one of them.
94:15 - So depending on the person team or stakeholder, you are explaining the
94:19 - situation to your communication needs to change because you cannot explain
94:25 - the same thing to all different people.
94:27 - All so always, that's why I have some clear examples where you had to deal
94:32 - with this type of situation, and then you would be golden.
94:35 - Next one is describe an instance where you had to work with limited resources.
94:40 - So limited resources can be in terms of limited time, limited people, limited
94:45 - number of people working on a project or limited set of tools or
94:49 - technology available to you, why you were there, what was your approach?
94:53 - How if let's say that there is only one single license that you can use amongst
94:58 - four different developers in the team.
95:00 - So how do you make sure that, uh, who is going to work on what?
95:04 - And because everyone wants to use that license, how would you take care of it?
95:08 - So maybe you can have a license sharing situation.
95:10 - Maybe you can create different time slots and for one time slot person is
95:14 - going to work on for another time slot person B is going to work on.
95:17 - And you can create these time time slots and different, different parts of day.
95:21 - So during the other times, people can focus on their other duties, or maybe
95:25 - they can be like off work or take, they'll like give a good rest to it to themselves.
95:31 - So this can be a way for better resource allocation, resource sharing.
95:36 - Next one is, can you talk about a long-term project that you manage?
95:40 - How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?
95:43 - So I think I just spoke about this like five minutes back for this.
95:47 - You need to ensure that every frequent weeks, you are keeping track of that.
95:53 - Uh, what were your expected timelines?
95:55 - What are your current timelines?
95:57 - How close you are with the expectation, how, uh, further away you are.
96:02 - Are you running in the red?
96:03 - Are you running in the orange?
96:04 - Are you running in the green?
96:05 - Are you ahead of schedule?
96:07 - Are you behind the schedule?
96:08 - Are you way behind the schedule?
96:09 - If you are way behind or behind the schedule, how do you adjust your timelines?
96:14 - Uh, how do you convey this message to the broader team, broader stakeholders?
96:18 - Why you started falling behind in the timeline?
96:22 - Uh, how do you keep tracking of this maybe for like next two years, because
96:26 - some projects they run like two to four years as well, and in some cases.
96:30 - So how, how do you keep all of these things checked for that?
96:33 - You need clear set of policies and processes in place that you follow
96:37 - rigorously for the entirety of that time with clear discipline and, uh, always
96:43 - have all of the entire audit trail of all the things that happened and all
96:46 - the decisions were made during that time.
96:49 - Okay.
96:49 - Next question is tell me about a time when you had to ball balance
96:53 - competing or priorities and how did you handle it?
96:56 - So an example for competing priorities could be maybe you are working on project
97:00 - a that is coming to a deadline.
97:02 - Maybe the project is not so significant.
97:04 - Like the product is relatively in low value or low impact, but that is
97:09 - coming closer to the deadline.
97:11 - Meanwhile, you are being asked that this project be really critical, but
97:14 - it is due in next six months.
97:16 - And so how do you manage that competing priorities?
97:19 - Because on one hand you have this product that is pretty close coming to
97:23 - just end of its task, but you still want to make sure that you finish strong and
97:27 - you complete all, all the responsibilities on the other side, do you
97:31 - have this new project that is really important in terms of priority, but
97:35 - you still have some time in between.
97:37 - So maybe you can put some more, more effort initially to complete this project
97:42 - and get rid of it from your schedule and then put more focus towards B or maybe
97:46 - you can start allocating like 30 or 30% 70% a weight towards both the projects.
97:53 - You discuss this with your manager or your product owner, that what is the
97:57 - importance of each one of them.
97:58 - And that will, that way it would give you clear indication on how much time
98:04 - you want to allocate that is going to yield the most impact for yourself, for
98:09 - your company and for, for your projects.
98:12 - So that, that is the important part.
98:14 - Okay.
98:14 - Next one is describe a situation where you had to be patient
98:17 - in order to achieve your goal.
98:19 - Again, long running projects, you had to be very patient next.
98:24 - Maybe you, you might have to be patient for that next technical
98:30 - thing you are planning to, maybe you were supposed to do last year, but
98:34 - then things change, priorities change.
98:36 - Now you are expecting, expecting to do it this year, but still you
98:40 - realize that you couldn't make it.
98:42 - How do you keep yourself motivated?
98:44 - How do you keep your team motivated?
98:46 - Do you have that ability of patients?
98:48 - Do you, can you set up the clear timelines and clear roadmaps for the
98:52 - moving, the path moving forward.
98:55 - So these, these sort of things.
98:57 - Okay.
98:57 - Now let's move on to the next topic that is communication.
99:00 - And let's go to the question number 31.
99:03 - Describe a situation where you had to use your communication
99:06 - skills to resolve a conflict.
99:07 - Again, pretty simple, pretty easy.
99:09 - Maybe you realize that there is some ongoing conflict between two
99:13 - peoples or two teams, maybe two, like yourself and your manager and whatnot.
99:18 - How do you resolve that?
99:20 - Just simple thing.
99:21 - Bring everything together, ask, investigate, what is the problem?
99:26 - And then come up with the solution, explain to each one of them that why
99:29 - they are in that, the situation, how can they get out of it?
99:33 - What should be the approach moving forward?
99:35 - And, uh, what, what would be like a common solution that everyone
99:39 - can come up with and with consensus.
99:41 - So you can think of your emotional intelligence and your communication
99:45 - skills to come up with the solution that tell me about a time when you had
99:48 - to give critical feedback to someone.
99:50 - How did you approach it?
99:52 - Now, there is a very common saying praise in public and criticize in
99:55 - private, all of the same rule.
99:57 - If you realize that maybe some of the employee or someone, some regarding
100:01 - some of their behavior or their skills, they are lacking something.
100:05 - Do you feel like your feedback would make an improvement?
100:08 - Feel free to go ahead.
100:09 - It's always a good practice to give proper, accurate, critical
100:14 - feedback to anyone and everyone.
100:16 - Uh, and also give it in a manner that they take it well, show them that
100:22 - exactly what, what is your intention?
100:25 - Why did you want it to do that?
100:27 - How did you, how would you approach it?
100:29 - You approach it calmly, gently.
100:31 - Uh, you give them specific examples and you also give them that how can
100:36 - they improve on the current situation?
100:39 - Plus confirm with them that they don't feel discouraged because you
100:43 - mentioned these things and you are just trying to help them out.
100:46 - You are trying to do what's best for the company and what's best
100:49 - for their own personal growth.
100:51 - So that can be your approach.
100:53 - You can explain this type of, uh, all the considerations in your interview
100:57 - and it's going to look really nice.
100:59 - Okay.
100:59 - Next one is describe a project where you took a creative
101:02 - approach to solve a problem.
101:04 - I think I, we already took care of very similar problems in the past.
101:08 - So I'm just going to skip ahead with this question, but make sure that you
101:12 - explain the situation where and how you become creative and talk about all the
101:18 - different aspects of the problems and situations and your, uh, in genuine
101:22 - solution.
101:23 - Okay.
101:24 - Next one is, can you provide me an example of a time when you had to juggle
101:27 - several projects at a time?
101:30 - This is pretty common because at any given moment, you might be working
101:34 - somewhere between like three to 15 projects, depending on like how complex
101:38 - your work schedule are and how stretched up resources are.
101:42 - So always, uh, set clear priorities and the priorities defined by the impact,
101:49 - by the type of deadlines, by the work that needs to be done, the skill level,
101:54 - the current project status, and all of these things.
101:57 - So there is no one particular reason about this.
102:00 - There is a huge topic about how do I manage expectations
102:04 - and how do I manage priorities?
102:06 - In my opinion, it is more of an art than a rigorous set of rules.
102:10 - You always have to juggle about these different things and think about, Oh,
102:14 - Hey, this needs to be done.
102:15 - Let me quickly fix that.
102:17 - This is important.
102:17 - Let me work upon this.
102:19 - This is important.
102:19 - Let me work upon this on top of it.
102:22 - At the same time, you will also have to realize that you only have
102:25 - limited time at your hand.
102:26 - So you don't put too much on a plate.
102:28 - If you realize that there are some low priority items, just be confrontational
102:33 - or be open-minded about it and just let the team know that this can be done
102:38 - later or this can be done by someone else.
102:40 - Feel free to delegate your work.
102:41 - Delegation is a great way to manage multiple items without losing the efficiency.
102:47 - So always do proper delegation, manage priorities and explain that what are
102:53 - your effective strategies to manage priorities basically.
102:57 - Next question is how do you prioritize your work when you have
103:00 - multiple projects to handle?
103:01 - I think it's pretty much the same question.
103:03 - So I'm just going to go ahead.
103:05 - Okay.
103:05 - Next one is describe a time when you had to use your negotiation skills.
103:10 - So you have to negotiate on many different aspects at your job.
103:15 - You have to, many times you have to negotiate with the clients, with the
103:17 - consumers, with your vendors, with the existing team members about the
103:22 - work you needs to be done, maybe with other team members, because you
103:26 - want to convince them that your project that you are suggesting or the
103:30 - work you're trying to do has more priorities and you are willing to
103:34 - complete it with these many resources under this timeframe.
103:38 - So what is a negotiation approach?
103:40 - Always come to a common ground, understand that what are all the different
103:44 - options available and try to find the best path possible for each one of them.
103:49 - Have some, and before you start negotiating, always understand that what
103:54 - is going to be the end result, because many times you are negotiating with,
103:57 - let's assume that you are working at a company and you are negotiating from
104:01 - someone else, from a different company.
104:03 - You are trying to sell your product to that company.
104:05 - You do all of these negotiations and you go through the whole process for
104:09 - three months, after three months, you realize that now that person also has
104:14 - to ask someone else to make that decision, which means maybe the whole
104:19 - negotiation process can restart again and you just wasted a lot of time.
104:23 - So always come to that conclusion that what are going to be the criteria
104:28 - that would be agreeable by both who are going to be the stakeholders
104:31 - making these decisions and what are the different negotiating approaches
104:36 - you would take.
104:37 - Always try to use the Nash equilibrium concept that is do what's best for
104:42 - both, and you will always find a common ground over there.
104:46 - Okay.
104:46 - Next one is tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities.
104:50 - Yeah, we just spoke about it.
104:52 - Moving on to the next question that is how do you handle constructive criticism?
104:56 - Really important topic.
104:58 - They really wants to know that, um, are you a person who can take feedback?
105:03 - Basically, that's it.
105:04 - If you're doing something wrong and if someone else tells you that you are
105:07 - doing it wrong, do you become more defensive or do you become more
105:11 - attentive towards what they're listening, what they're saying?
105:14 - And then rather than discrediting them or saying that, no, no, no, this is not
105:20 - why I did that, just be open-minded.
105:22 - Maybe I made a mistake.
105:23 - Everyone makes a mistake.
105:25 - Thank you so much for pointing it out.
105:28 - I'll try to find a solution, but if you already know that what can be a better
105:31 - approach, also let me know.
105:33 - I can think about it, understand or gain that expertise, uh, and then take it with
105:39 - me so that next time I don't make the same mistake.
105:43 - That's a great attitude.
105:44 - If some, if you can find a person who can take the constructive criticism in a
105:49 - better manner and work on that, improve on that and make sure to not to repeat
105:54 - the same mistake twice, that person would end up becoming like probably
105:59 - the most successful employee or even the CEO of your company, because that is
106:03 - the correct right mindset you want.
106:05 - Everyone makes the mistake.
106:07 - The question is how many unique mistakes you can make and the more unique
106:12 - mistakes you make, the smarter you are going to become.
106:15 - And I'm focusing the, my emphasis on the word unique because you don't want to
106:19 - make the same mistake again and again.
106:21 - That's just the definition of insanity.
106:24 - Okay.
106:24 - So now moving on to the next question, can you describe a time when you had to
106:28 - communicate complex information clearly?
106:33 - Maybe there are some exact requirements that needs to be met.
106:37 - Maybe you need to convey the message to different teams and you want to ensure
106:42 - that the integrity of information remains constant.
106:45 - They all understand.
106:46 - So how do you do that?
106:47 - One approach is you explain what you are showing, you noted down, write it down,
106:52 - have a SharePoint, share it with everyone.
106:55 - Plus you reach out to them and confirm that.
106:58 - Did they understand what you are trying to convey, gather that information, make
107:03 - sure that you both are on the same page.
107:05 - So you don't miss out the important details in the somewhere between communication.
107:11 - And then there is some misunderstanding and in the end you, you are expecting to
107:16 - have almonds and you get peaches.
107:18 - So don't, don't be like that.
107:20 - Okay.
107:21 - Next one is describe a situation where you had to actively listen to someone
107:25 - and understand their perspective.
107:28 - This can be once again, go back to my very previous examples I gave about an
107:34 - employee, not pulling their weight.
107:36 - Just because I was trying to understand their situation, I was putting more
107:42 - emphasis on listening, what they had to say, understanding what they had to suffer.
107:46 - And it wasn't like initially that employee was reluctant to give me the
107:53 - whole story on why that employee is not able to do and why he's not meeting
107:58 - the deadlines, but somewhere along the lines, I understood that maybe there
108:02 - might be some other issues apart from the work related thing that might be
108:07 - hampering that the decision and the work efficiency, and that was the case.
108:12 - So active listening is lot of parts.
108:15 - It is trying to understand person scenario.
108:17 - It involves a lot of emotional intelligence and read a lot of reading
108:22 - between the lines plus you need to be attentive that you are understanding
108:27 - what each and everything that other person is conveying to you without any
108:31 - like biases or judgments or whatnot.
108:33 - So make sure to give an example that elaborate this kind of scenario that
108:38 - would really look good for your behavioral interviews.
108:41 - Okay.
108:41 - Now the last topic that is leadership.
108:44 - Now this topic is mostly going to be for folks who are applying for like more
108:48 - senior level positions, maybe like managerial or director level or VP level
108:53 - position, and I'm pretty sure that they must have done hundreds of interviews
108:57 - throughout their career, so they might have most of the idea.
109:01 - Um, I don't have much leadership experience, but if I have to give an
109:06 - example, or if I am taking an interview, these are the things I would be expecting.
109:10 - So this is what I would explain for each one of the questions.
109:13 - And, uh, again, make sure to make your own answers, make your own, reflect
109:18 - your own self and see where, uh, the answer suits you.
109:22 - Okay.
109:23 - Give me an example of a goal you set and how did you achieve it?
109:26 - So goal can be for your personal self or maybe for your team or for your
109:30 - company, for your project, maybe it can be a short term goal, long term goal.
109:34 - How did you keep track of it?
109:36 - Uh, how did you ensure that you are moving in the correct direction?
109:39 - If you face any setbacks, how did you get out from that?
109:42 - So these are all the things you can talk about it.
109:44 - If I have to talk about it, I can talk about my YouTube channel because
109:48 - initially, like there was not my goal, but after making like somewhere around 50, 60
109:53 - videos, it became my goal that I want to initially start talking about like all
109:58 - the data section algorithm related questions.
110:00 - Then I started talking about system design concepts.
110:03 - Then I started talking about behavioral interviews.
110:05 - Then I, then I'll start talking about maybe different languages.
110:09 - So my goal post is to create like this product ecosystem of challenge channel
110:14 - that contains a lot of information that is going to be helpful for all
110:17 - the folks, uh, in their career.
110:19 - So that that's my goal.
110:20 - Uh, now next question is, have you ever had to make an unpopular decision?
110:25 - How did you handle the feedback?
110:27 - Unpopular decision can be anything.
110:29 - Maybe there is a service or a park you are cutting out.
110:31 - Maybe you, you have to lay off some people, uh, maybe you have to change
110:37 - some things in a company that is going to impose some stricter policies that
110:42 - might create an additional workload or headache for different people, but
110:46 - it can be helpful in the long run.
110:48 - So how did you handle the feedback?
110:50 - First, you make sure to convey your message that why you are taking the step.
110:56 - And then realize that what are the concerns different teams are coming back up with.
111:00 - Have that open mindness, have that, uh, like active listening component to it.
111:06 - Realize that what is the feedback?
111:08 - Maybe there might be some things that you might have missed.
111:10 - So if you, if that is the case, how did you handle it?
111:13 - Can you try to go ahead and fix it?
111:15 - Are you able to take, take yourself accountable that, Hey, this is the thing
111:19 - I proposed to do, but I forgot about these three different dimensions or options.
111:24 - And, uh, let me fix that.
111:26 - Uh, I'm accountable for that.
111:27 - I'm responsible for that.
111:29 - And I'm making that change.
111:30 - So it always shows you as a, as a better human being.
111:33 - Okay.
111:34 - Next one is, have you ever experienced, have you ever worked on a project that failed?
111:38 - How did you learn from that experience?
111:40 - Like almost everyone has worked on some project that failed.
111:43 - Maybe it failed because of lack of resources or the product didn't do well.
111:47 - Or the productive build was not very viable.
111:50 - Maybe some other competitor came up with a better product that it eventually died.
111:55 - Or maybe you never finished the project.
111:57 - Maybe the priorities change.
111:59 - Maybe the resources working on, we're not even not there.
112:02 - And it went way over budget or way out of bounds.
112:06 - Like the failed projects are the best test case scenario that helps you grow
112:11 - significantly, because then you would know that these are the 10 things I should not
112:15 - be doing think of Thomas Alva Edison.
112:18 - Edison failed to make the light bulb first 1000 times still kept on trying
112:23 - with better material, different methods.
112:27 - Eventually we are all living in the world of electricity.
112:30 - So that's, that's the approach.
112:32 - Okay.
112:33 - Next one is, can you give me an example of how you handled high stress, high stress
112:38 - situation?
112:38 - I think I spoke about this earlier, but still, um, like working under pressure
112:43 - and going above and beyond for your job.
112:45 - So this is very similar to that.
112:47 - But when you are speaking about like leadership level, high stress stress can
112:51 - be with like bad company results.
112:53 - Maybe, um, having a product, not do its job, or you have, you might have to lay
112:59 - off some people or you realize that your entire portfolio is going to change.
113:03 - How would you deal with that?
113:04 - So you always try to keep yourself calm, uh, think about all the different
113:10 - options, different parameters.
113:12 - If you can seek advice, reach out to different people, take feedback.
113:16 - Uh, think out loud, always writing always helps whenever you are in a
113:21 - precarious situation.
113:22 - So these can be different coping mechanisms you can take or take on hand.
113:26 - Next one is, tell me about a time when you had to take responsibility
113:29 - for an error made by someone else.
113:31 - I can give you a very good example.
113:33 - Uh, this was like Dr.
113:36 - AP Jabdul Karam now, for those who don't know, he's, uh, he has an Indian
113:41 - prime president, and he was also a scientist who was working on a lot of
113:46 - like satellite launches for India, for Indian space research organization.
113:50 - So he once gave an example where he was like, uh, he was working on a project
113:55 - and they tried to launch the satellite, but it failed mid air and then it crashed.
113:59 - And, um, that time it was a huge setback for the company.
114:03 - Now at that time, he mentioned that he was the project manager.
114:06 - He was the, he was responsible for that failure, but his director came out in
114:12 - public in press and said everyone that the director said that I failed.
114:19 - I made a judgment call.
114:21 - Maybe this was an error.
114:23 - We understand that this was the fault.
114:25 - We assess all the failures and now we are going to work upon it to fix our
114:30 - mistakes and then we will make sure that we move forward with, uh, the success.
114:35 - Dr.
114:36 - A B Jadul Kalam, he became like really, uh, like question that why, because he
114:44 - knew that he was responsible and still that director had faith in him.
114:48 - He's like, don't worry.
114:50 - I have faith.
114:50 - Everyone makes the mistake.
114:52 - Now we will have to make sure that we deliver it successfully.
114:57 - And after two years, they launched the same satellite with success.
115:00 - And that paved a path for which like all the achievements that Indian
115:05 - space research agency made, um, in their space program.
115:09 - So you can understand that how a leadership position person being
115:16 - accountable for himself while motivating his or her team is actually making
115:23 - significant impact for the accountability and also shielding the inner team from
115:29 - a lot of that outside of bounds or outside of, uh, like negativity that
115:35 - could be coming out.
115:36 - So always, if you have such experiences, feel free to share it and explain that.
115:41 - Why do you do that?
115:43 - And what was the outcome of it?
115:44 - Okay.
115:45 - Next question is that, how do you assess success of a project?
115:49 - Give an example, like a couple of common example on time and on budget.
115:54 - These are the two major factors.
115:55 - Next one is once the project has been deployed or is running in the
115:58 - production or consumers are using, what is the response, uh, how they are taking
116:03 - it, how they are treating it, how, what people has to say about it for that.
116:06 - You have to take constant feedbacks.
116:08 - Plus you can also learn that can your project become a framework for other
116:12 - projects that you're going to do in the future, then it makes it a legendary project.
116:17 - So these are all the different parameters and you can also explain for each project
116:21 - that you worked upon, you can give like two, three examples at this project I
116:25 - worked upon, I feel like success was, uh, building and delivering a critical, uh,
116:31 - application in like shorter timeframe using the completely new text a text
116:36 - tag with like five different teams working in tandem to get it done.
116:41 - So this can be also one of the examples.
116:42 - Okay.
116:43 - Next is tell me about a time when you had to disout without all the information you
116:48 - needed.
116:49 - So maybe you are in some high stress situations, high stress scenario, and you
116:54 - have to make a decision because if you wait together, all the information, it
116:58 - might be too late or you might be losing too much money.
117:00 - So there is a fine line you will have to cross between like efficiency and
117:07 - defiance that you don't want to define.
117:09 - You don't want to be that dictatorial person that, Hey, just because I said, so
117:13 - do it, but you also want to make sure that you are taking the calculated risk that if
117:18 - you take this option or this option without having all the background or all
117:22 - the key information, what are going to be their different approaches.
117:25 - And if you have ever helped to face that situation, uh, then yeah, feel free to
117:28 - explain that next one is describe a situation where you had to analyze the
117:33 - data and make a recommendation.
117:35 - What approach did you take?
117:38 - There was, there are, there have been very famous movies on analyzing data and
117:42 - then making some decisions like money ball and big short.
117:46 - If you haven't watched them, go ahead and watch them.
117:48 - But in your case, if you have to make some decisions based on the data,
117:51 - first realize that what type of data you are dealing with and what type of
117:55 - decision you are making, maybe you are trying to make a decision that in your
117:58 - existing company, you are currently operating in three different regions.
118:02 - Now you wants to operate in two more regions and you have these seven
118:05 - regions to pick from what are going to be the criteria you would be looking for.
118:09 - So in that case, data would be what is the property rates?
118:13 - What are the, uh, what, what type of a census is there?
118:18 - How many number of people are living?
118:20 - What are their nationalities, ethnicities, culture groups?
118:23 - What, uh, what are the products you are trying to ship or deploy?
118:27 - What is going to be the logistics?
118:29 - What are going to be the cost of each one of them?
118:31 - What are the prospects of earning money?
118:33 - So these are the data that you should be looking at and based on that, you would
118:36 - be able to make decisions plus right now, you can also use a lot of like data
118:41 - science and machine learning and AI to make decisions using the data because
118:45 - data is a huge commodity and that can give you great insight on the future
118:51 - predictor of things that you are trying to do.
118:54 - So that's why always, uh, take, take data very seriously.
118:58 - Next question is, have you ever faced an ethical dilemma at work?
119:02 - How did you handle it?
119:03 - Like I personally have never faced an ethical dilemma,
119:06 - but I can give you an example.
119:07 - Like maybe say one example, you realize that one of your employee, um, who
119:13 - walks under you and that employee did something unintentional, you know, for
119:19 - sure that that employee did something unintentional and they realized that
119:23 - that was their mistake.
119:24 - Now the question is if you go out and say the same thing to the HR, you, that
119:31 - employees for sure getting fired.
119:33 - Now, if you don't say to the HR, you are not doing your job as a manager.
119:38 - The other thing is that the unintentional wrong thing that employee did, maybe it
119:44 - was, yeah, it was wrong, but the impact was not like no, no one got hurt.
119:50 - Nobody got impacted, but it was a wrong thing to do.
119:53 - So this is the ethical dilemma.
119:55 - How do you approach it?
119:56 - So first you assess all the situations.
119:58 - Like if I personally have to do it, I might give like a slap on the
120:04 - wrist for that employee, if they unintentionally did it, and they realize
120:09 - that mistake, if they intentionally did it for sure, I'm going to complain to the
120:12 - HR, but, uh, if it is unintentional and maybe he mistakes anyone can make and
120:17 - they didn't know, and it caused no harm.
120:20 - But I will give like a written emails showing that, Hey, these are the things
120:25 - you did, they should not have been done.
120:26 - And, um, like warning, like maybe strike one and strike two at the same time.
120:31 - But I would make sure I would try at least that that person does not lose his
120:35 - or her job and then maybe ruin their entire career.
120:39 - So this would be one of the ethical dilemmas that I can think of.
120:43 - Okay.
120:43 - Next one is describe a situation where you had to took a risk and paid off once
120:47 - again, taking calculated risk, understanding all the information.
120:51 - Maybe you have all the relevant data.
120:53 - Maybe you don't have all the relevant data.
120:55 - If you have the data, how would it impact your judgment?
120:58 - If you don't have the data, how would it impact impact your judgment?
121:01 - So think of these things.
121:02 - And this concludes all the 50 answers.
121:06 - Now, once again, for all the 50 answers, I hope you were following along and I'm
121:12 - sorry if I kept on and on about different questions, but make sure that the, for
121:17 - these questions, you have your own set of answers.
121:20 - Now let's move on to the next topic.
121:22 - And that is dealing with difficult questions.
121:24 - So once again, all, no questions are made equal.
121:29 - Some questions might be easy.
121:30 - Some questions might be difficult.
121:32 - Some questions might be easy for some people.
121:34 - Some question might be easy for difficult people.
121:36 - So it depends, varies from people to people, but always make sure that you
121:41 - understand that why the question is difficult.
121:43 - And that's where it came along that, uh, Hey, if you are giving the question that
121:48 - give me an example where you had to persuade the others, the important
121:52 - crux of this question is why did you had to persuade the others?
121:56 - What was the exact scenario?
121:58 - And then what was your approach on pursuing others for what you are trying to propose?
122:04 - So this, this can be one of the examples.
122:06 - Um, next thing is whenever you have to speak about or talk about different
122:10 - weaknesses and failures of yourself, be open to that many times I've seen like,
122:15 - and I personally experienced that in the past as well, that I was always too
122:19 - reluctant to talk about my failures and, uh, the mistakes I made or weaknesses I
122:24 - had, but as I grew more mature in my career, I realized that this is what made
122:31 - me what I am today, all the mistakes I did, all the weaknesses I had, and I had
122:36 - to overcome that, that gave me a huge confidence boost.
122:39 - It gave me the sincerity of how wrong things can happen.
122:44 - How can I learn from that?
122:45 - How can I move away from that?
122:48 - Why, why should not know I not carry it on my shoulder as a burden, but rather
122:52 - than use it as a footstep to climb that next step and learn that next, next thing.
122:58 - So always understand that these are some of the strategies you can have on yourself.
123:04 - Whenever you are dealing with a difficult question, first try to stay calm and
123:08 - compose, you can ask the interviewer that, Hey, can I take like a 30 second pause or
123:13 - a one minute pause, um, just to think about the formula, how to formulate the
123:18 - answer, what are all the aspects I'm going to talk about it, maybe make some
123:21 - bullet points in your head and then start formalizing the answer using the star
123:27 - methodology.
123:27 - Okay.
123:28 - So this can be one of the good approaches.
123:30 - Always try to stay calm.
123:31 - If you, even if you encounter some questions that are like way out of your
123:35 - imagination, at least take on like, uh, previously Google used to ask this funny
123:41 - question that why manhole covers are circle and not square in the New York
123:45 - city makes no sense, but still they ask, they ask many people the same questions.
123:52 - What are you going to do?
123:53 - If you don't know the answer to some people be like, if I want to go down
123:57 - straight, I don't want to get myself hurt across 90 degree angles.
124:01 - So it was, yeah, that, that was a pretty good answer actually.
124:05 - So there can be many examples.
124:07 - Okay.
124:07 - Now let's understand that.
124:09 - How can you incorporate emotional intelligence in your
124:12 - interview and in your answers?
124:14 - Emotional intelligence is something that comes with practice and seeing things
124:19 - the way they are and the way they are not.
124:22 - It's like trying to understand both sides of the coin and how it can come
124:27 - into your answers or your interview.
124:30 - You always wants to be empathize and try to find the root of the cause.
124:34 - So again, even if the interviewer is asking you a question, try to understand
124:38 - that what is the root behind this question?
124:40 - What is the purpose they're looking for?
124:42 - Or if you're giving some answer, did you thought about all the scenarios?
124:47 - Were you dealing with empathy?
124:48 - So these are the things you want to always make sure that you want to be
124:55 - demonstrating that you are a person who has a lot of empathy for different
124:59 - people, and that makes the situation 10 times lighter.
125:04 - Plus, if you're self-aware about your behavior and what human tendencies
125:08 - other people can do, then it helps you make more sense of the situation and
125:14 - try to tread the waters carefully.
125:16 - Okay.
125:17 - And of course, make sure that you balance the professional and personal
125:22 - lives and scenarios.
125:23 - You don't mix them.
125:24 - It's never a good idea.
125:25 - So always do that.
125:27 - So emotional intelligence in action is if you want, there are actually a lot
125:33 - of movies that have emotional intelligence in action, but think about
125:38 - Michael Keaton from the Dark Knight Rises, or sorry, the original Dark
125:43 - Knight, where he's explaining to Bruce Banner or Bruce Wayne that why Joker
125:50 - was doing all of these things.
125:51 - And then he explained the things about that some men just want to watch the world burn.
125:56 - So you can't reason with them.
125:58 - You can't argue with them, but you just have to deal with him.
126:00 - And that gave Batman an idea that how to deal with the Joker.
126:04 - So this can be that shows that the Butler Michael Keaton in that movie is a person
126:10 - with extreme emotional intelligence and sees the world from different angle.
126:14 - Now, this is nowhere near in terms of correlation with your actual interview,
126:19 - but just an example.
126:21 - Okay.
126:22 - Next topic is nonverbal communication.
126:24 - How do you behave and how do you speak without speaking?
126:28 - This is really important.
126:30 - Your body posture and gestures, they make significant difference.
126:34 - So how do you take care of it?
126:35 - Your body language, you need to set up in like a good manner, sit, try to sit
126:42 - straight, try to look them in the eye, try to smile here and there.
126:45 - Everyone likes a smiling face and try to use like your hand gestures, your
126:50 - body gestures and in a decent manner, use the space around that is currently
126:54 - available in the room now with the interviews that are now always going to
126:58 - be two scenarios, either you are giving on-premise interview or onsite interview,
127:02 - or you are giving a virtual interview in both scenarios.
127:05 - The consideration for nonverbal communication would be completely different.
127:09 - If you are in person in place, how do you ensure that your nonverbal
127:14 - communication is on point smile here and there, have a good eye contact, make sure
127:19 - that you are sitting at a reasonably well distance.
127:24 - Even if a conference room has a huge table, you don't want to sit too close
127:28 - with each other, you don't want to sit too away from each other, just like use
127:32 - the space around yourself, but don't use it too crazily or too aggressively.
127:37 - Just be overall in the moment so that that is going to feel really good.
127:41 - Plus have like smiling facial expression.
127:45 - Don't have creepy smiles or something like that, but just like
127:47 - everyone loves a smiling face.
127:50 - Next thing is if you have to talk about the virtual interviews, few topics would
127:54 - be at least try to look directly in the camera, try to make sure that your
127:59 - background is clear or you are using appropriate filters, your mic is working.
128:04 - You are reasonably well dressed.
128:06 - Your hair looks good.
128:07 - Your face looks good.
128:08 - You are at least being presentable for that, that interview.
128:14 - And you are giving it the sincerity that interview deserves.
128:18 - So always be mindful of that.
128:21 - And now let's talk about some of the important preparation strategies.
128:25 - I know we have been talking quite a lot about all the different preparation
128:28 - strategies we can have throughout this entire session, but now let's just
128:32 - talk about a few of them.
128:33 - Number one, make sure to write all the stories and all the experience
128:38 - experiences that you had ideally for each of the five categories we talk about.
128:43 - Maybe have like three stories for each one of them.
128:47 - If you have like somewhere around 15 to 20 stories, you are set.
128:50 - You would be able to give all, all of the different options.
128:54 - And, uh, any type of questions can be asked.
128:57 - You now, you just have to pinpoint, okay, for the, in order to explain the
129:01 - disagreement with myself, with a colleague, this is the story I'm going to say in
129:06 - order for a disagreement from myself with a client, this is what I'm going
129:10 - to explain whatnot and all always make sure that, uh, you are practicing
129:14 - everything with star methodology, situation, task, action, result, all
129:19 - four, four things, because that way you are following up the whole timeline
129:24 - of the question.
129:26 - You are taking the interviewer throughout the exact situation and also ending up
129:31 - at what was the result achieved in the end.
129:33 - So practice the star method for each of the stories that you are going to write
129:37 - at least write one or two points that is going to be just for yourself.
129:41 - So you can quickly remind yourself that, Hey, this was the situation.
129:44 - And this was the action we took.
129:45 - And this was what we did.
129:46 - Okay.
129:47 - Next thing is, if you can do mock interviews, this is going to be really
129:54 - important, find your friends, find some group, maybe there are some online
129:58 - communities, reach out to them, find some strangers, you take their mock and you
130:03 - give mock interviews to them.
130:05 - This is going to be a win-win for both of you.
130:08 - You would be able to see from the perspective of an interviewer, whenever
130:11 - someone else is giving the answer that how does it feel and what was your
130:15 - intent and did they justify your intent or not, and the more interviews you give
130:21 - the better and sharper your answers will get.
130:24 - So always, I cannot emphasize enough.
130:26 - If you just do mock interviews, you would be set and just any curveball, any random
130:33 - questions can be thrown at you be in the moment.
130:37 - This is a great opportunity for you to outshine yourself, to show the interviewer
130:43 - that what type of person you are, what type of character you have, what are the
130:47 - experiences you have learned.
130:49 - So behavioral interview, in my opinion, is a great way to showcase your skill.
130:54 - And that's why I take it as an opportunity rather than an obstacle.
130:58 - And it's going to be really helpful.
131:00 - Now we are going to talk about few resources.
131:04 - So number one, just take these two books.
131:07 - They are really popular books, cracking the coding interview or 101 great answers
131:12 - to the toughest interview questions.
131:14 - Like there are online copies available.
131:16 - There are copies on the Amazon available, pick whatever you want to.
131:20 - And, uh, if you are a reader, just go through them.
131:24 - There are a lot of online courses available on LinkedIn, Learning Coursera and Udemy
131:29 - plus this course, you already have this.
131:31 - So I did not mention YouTube, but since you are already watching this on YouTube.
131:35 - So of course, you do YouTube is also going to be there.
131:38 - There are some popular sub reddits on the Reddit website.
131:42 - So if you want to go to like jobs or interviews or CS career questions,
131:46 - specifically for tech, uh, inter tech jobs, all the, these three are really good,
131:52 - really popular.
131:52 - They help you out with the resume reviews and questions and answers.
131:56 - So you can understand what type of questions are being asked.
131:59 - What are the expectations at different companies?
132:01 - They also help you with like negotiation strategies and salaries and whatnot.
132:05 - Okay.
132:06 - Next one, couple of really good websites, levels.fyi, because it shows a lot of
132:11 - different things on different companies, how they behave and what are the benefits
132:16 - they have, the pugs, they have the employees, they have the compensation they
132:18 - have and plus they have a very good community page so that they have a very
132:23 - active community where you can post many questions.
132:25 - And next one is glass door where the appropriate employees of any particular
132:30 - company leave their experiences and reviews for that company.
132:34 - So that can come in really handy.
