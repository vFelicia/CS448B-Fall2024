00:00 - in this video we are going to talk about
00:02 - variables and also a concept called
00:04 - camel case they're not necessarily
00:05 - related but we're going to cover them
00:06 - both variables are any value that you
00:09 - want to set you initially say the
00:12 - variable like there also meaning
00:14 - variable that's how we say it in
00:15 - JavaScript ver bana teacher equals true
00:19 - we just declared a variable which
00:21 - happens to be a Boolean from the last
00:23 - video this variable is also in camel
00:26 - case in JavaScript the way they keep
00:29 - things legible without spaces is the
00:31 - first word is completely lowercase every
00:34 - word after that the first letter is
00:36 - uppercase but there are no spaces pretty
00:39 - straightforward let's do a little
00:41 - inspecting on free code Camp's page and
00:43 - see if we can find some variables in
00:45 - their code so this is the free code Camp
00:48 - home screen we are going to open up
00:50 - Chrome Dev tools which you will find out
00:53 - how to use later on if you haven't
00:55 - already and let's just go ahead and look
00:57 - at their Javascript file we're going to
00:58 - look for a variable an example of a
01:00 - variable on their page and there's a
01:02 - couple already I can see here there
01:05 - x equals document docket element by tag
01:08 - name that's also an example of Dom
01:10 - manipulation which is something else
01:12 - we'll talk about in other videos let's
01:14 - see what else have we got
01:18 - here that's the biggest one that I see
01:20 - the first one I see so even variables
01:22 - here V INSP it's another Dom
01:24 - manipulation but this is how you define
01:28 - variables you say there you say what you
01:30 - want the ver to be called and then you
01:32 - can put pretty much anything else that
01:34 - will end up being equal to that name
01:36 - that you can reference later on
