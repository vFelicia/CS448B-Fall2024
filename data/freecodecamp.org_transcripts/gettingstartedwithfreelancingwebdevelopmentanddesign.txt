00:00 - testy
00:02 - okay
00:03 - um
00:05 - yeah so more
00:07 - about me my name's cara
00:10 - this is steven my husband and we own
00:13 - steed interactive
00:15 - um which we've been doing for about the
00:18 - last three years a little over three
00:19 - years now
00:21 - and
00:22 - basically
00:24 - we went like we jumped in feet first
00:27 - i think stephen stephen has been doing
00:31 - code stuff for about 10 years prior to
00:33 - this at
00:34 - oklahoma christian
00:36 - as their web development director
00:39 - and then
00:41 - moved short time to an agency that
00:43 - doing web stuff and it was just
00:46 - not really his cup of tea
00:48 - and then
00:49 - i had been doing some freelance on the
00:52 - side for a while since i was out of
00:54 - school
00:55 - and uh
00:59 - so i i am a graphic designer and
01:03 - that's kind of my background a lot of
01:05 - branding work and um in design
01:09 - and
01:10 - we basically jumped in full
01:12 - uh
01:13 - like he quit his job and i had already
01:16 - quit a while back to stay home with
01:18 - babies
01:19 - and um so we were both doing this at the
01:22 - same time and
01:24 - we started out kind of freelance and
01:27 - then we decided okay we want to start
01:30 - making
01:31 - um the recurring monthly income so we're
01:34 - going to add people and add services and
01:37 - kind of start building up an agency and
01:40 - so for like
01:42 - the last all of 2017 we were we were
01:45 - saying like we're an agency we do
01:47 - content development and that kind of
01:49 - thing and sell our services that way
01:51 - and just this last year we kind of
01:53 - realized okay we've um we've made a lot
01:55 - of mistakes we don't necessarily know
01:58 - how to sell our services and adding
02:00 - people is just kind of adding to the
02:02 - chaos
02:03 - and so we've actually cut back
02:05 - and we're now kind of moving back to the
02:09 - freelance
02:10 - side of things
02:13 - in a more
02:15 - smart way maybe
02:16 - we've learned from a lot of our mistakes
02:19 - we're learning how to sell our services
02:21 - we're learning what like actually
02:23 - appeals to our clients and what's
02:25 - helpful for our clients
02:27 - and instead of just kind of not knowing
02:30 - what we're doing we're working on
02:32 - building up our business with the two of
02:34 - us and making sure that we know
02:36 - how to grow our business without
02:40 - you know without just adding people
02:42 - adding services adding time sold
02:45 - so um
02:46 - that's what's been going on these last
02:49 - three years and i'm hoping to
02:51 - kind of share some of our mistakes with
02:54 - you today so that you can learn from
02:56 - them instead of
02:58 - doing them yourself
02:59 - and um
03:02 - so that's kind of the last
03:05 - three years and i'll i'll tell you
03:07 - there's um
03:08 - there's four things
03:10 - before you jump into freelance and i um
03:12 - i was asking a little while ago um
03:15 - you
03:16 - you do freelance in the back and then
03:18 - who else has done freelance kimberly
03:21 - um
03:22 - and you've done freelance but everyone
03:24 - else is that is freelance a goal for you
03:27 - is that something that you are
03:28 - interested in doing once you learn
03:32 - what you're doing okay
03:33 - yeah
03:34 - um
03:35 - so yeah before you jump into that
03:38 - um there's there's four things that you
03:40 - need to understand and i will say
03:42 - uh there are a ton of resources online
03:45 - like google is your best friend when
03:46 - you're getting started in this like so
03:48 - if you're looking to you know pricing or
03:51 - accounting or
03:52 - you know all that all the technical
03:54 - stuff that gets you know the background
03:57 - of what you
03:59 - are needing to do google is your best
04:00 - friend you can find a lot of help online
04:03 - a lot of free information
04:06 - um but there's four things that you need
04:08 - to understand
04:09 - and kind of work towards for uh
04:12 - freelance if you want to be successful
04:15 - and um
04:17 - and i will say like
04:19 - a lot of
04:20 - a lot of this like we kind of just
04:21 - realized like okay we don't have a good
04:24 - understanding of these things how can we
04:25 - get that and
04:27 - we were pa we paid consultants to figure
04:29 - this out um so that's always an option
04:32 - for you but um
04:34 - some mistakes that we were making over
04:36 - these last three years
04:38 - one we were very attached we were very
04:41 - up close and personal with our
04:43 - deliverables in the actual product that
04:45 - we sold
04:47 - we
04:48 - took a lot of pride in our work which is
04:51 - a really good thing to have
04:53 - it's good to be confident in what you're
04:54 - doing but um
04:57 - when i say we're too attached to what we
04:59 - were selling
05:01 - uh what
05:02 - what we're doing is we kind of put value
05:05 - on our services that someone else
05:07 - doesn't see
05:08 - like it's when you're kind of up there
05:11 - working you're putting in the hours
05:14 - you don't realize like
05:17 - uh
05:18 - what someone else is seeing
05:21 - what your clients actually value it's
05:23 - hard to
05:24 - communicate
05:26 - to them the value of you know your time
05:29 - or your expertise if all you're doing is
05:32 - kind of
05:33 - if it's one-sided perspective of
05:35 - your
05:36 - work um
05:38 - we didn't understand money when we
05:40 - started
05:41 - when we started it out we
05:44 - were basically just trying to make up
05:46 - our
05:47 - salary
05:49 - and for freelance
05:51 - there's so much more that goes into
05:53 - pricing your services than just making
05:55 - up your salary
05:58 - a lot of it is like of course you want
06:01 - to survive and you want to be able to
06:03 - pay your bills
06:05 - but there's a lot more that goes into
06:07 - your cost than just the time that goes
06:09 - into each product
06:11 - or each deliverable and so um i'll go
06:14 - into that too
06:15 - and then we didn't understand value and
06:17 - that's kind of the same as uh we were
06:19 - too attached to the deliverables but we
06:20 - didn't really understand
06:22 - how to um
06:24 - communicate to our clients in a way that
06:27 - they understand in
06:29 - a way that kind of leads them to see
06:31 - what
06:33 - why why they need us
06:35 - um
06:36 - so yeah that's that's like the big
06:38 - things
06:39 - and i think that a lot of freelancers uh
06:42 - don't think about you know how they're
06:44 - going to actually sell their services or
06:47 - how they're going to
06:49 - you know make up their time and make
06:51 - make sure that they are full
06:53 - have a full roster of clients
06:56 - a lot of
06:57 - people just kind of jump in blindly
06:59 - saying hey i got this cool thing
07:01 - and that's actually one of the things i
07:04 - i love freelance for is that anyone can
07:06 - do it anyone can jump in anyone
07:09 - has the it's very accessible to people
07:12 - it's kind of a
07:14 - a great neutralizer because you don't
07:16 - have to be part of a bigger company
07:18 - you don't have to be dependent on you
07:21 - know them just kind of feeding you like
07:22 - the scraps um
07:25 - you actually get to
07:27 - set your prices and you know make the
07:29 - money that you want to make through
07:31 - freelance
07:32 - and um
07:35 - if if only like it was
07:37 - that easy and it actually is easy you
07:38 - just have to kind of know what those
07:40 - things are in order to make that money
07:44 - so yeah back to
07:46 - uh
07:48 - the four things that you need to
07:49 - understand
07:51 - if you can
07:53 - detach
07:54 - from your product detach from the
07:56 - deliverables so um
07:59 - you're putting a lot of time into making
08:01 - sure that you have a quality product
08:03 - that you have a quality
08:06 - um
08:07 - that you that you do quality work
08:09 - and you're very up close and personable
08:11 - personable with that but if you can
08:13 - detach from
08:15 - what you're doing each day
08:17 - and and realize you know
08:19 - on a
08:20 - some people are too emotionally close to
08:22 - their product in order to have a kind of
08:25 - bird's eye view of it
08:27 - um and that that goes like for just when
08:30 - you're communicating with your clients
08:32 - when you're
08:33 - trying to
08:35 - price your services and when you're
08:37 - doing sales if you can detach
08:39 - emotionally from
08:40 - that product you are going to be a
08:42 - better business person
08:44 - you can be a better uh you know be more
08:47 - empathetic to your clients when they
08:48 - don't understand what's going on
08:50 - and it just makes you
08:53 - more approachable if you
08:56 - can come at this product as you know a
08:59 - little bit less
09:00 - emotionally attached
09:02 - another reason you want to detach from
09:03 - your products is if you are
09:06 - you know building this business out like
09:08 - if you're if you do end up doing
09:10 - freelance all the time um eventually
09:12 - you're going to want to be able to bring
09:14 - more people on
09:16 - and be able to uh
09:19 - you know sell sell more than just the
09:21 - thing that you're selling
09:24 - and and the way you do that is you know
09:26 - you have to kind of
09:28 - let other
09:30 - developers other
09:32 - other people kind of bring their craft
09:34 - in
09:34 - and they're going to do things different
09:36 - than you but it still
09:38 - is still good
09:40 - so if you can detach just from the
09:42 - product itself a little bit
09:44 - the other thing is money
09:47 - so
09:48 - you need to understand money before you
09:50 - jump into freelance and i will say
09:52 - there's uh three stages of freelance
09:54 - and basically there's the first stage
09:56 - where you're kind of learning
09:58 - freelance and learning how to work with
10:00 - clients learning how to
10:03 - get a
10:05 - deliverable produced that is a quality
10:08 - product
10:09 - and you're basically kind of like
10:12 - feeling it out i would say that this
10:13 - stage is best done when
10:16 - when you are still have a nine to five
10:18 - salary
10:19 - uh not not the way that stephen and i
10:22 - did it
10:23 - um
10:24 - we did a lot of learning that first year
10:26 - just uh trying to figure out um
10:29 - what even like how to go back and forth
10:31 - with clients or
10:33 - you know how many rounds of um
10:36 - what with design you have to kind of do
10:38 - like re revisions and that kind of thing
10:42 - so we were just learning way too much
10:45 - being paid full time
10:47 - and
10:49 - then there's the second stage of
10:51 - freelance where you are
10:54 - confident in the deliverable that you've
10:56 - produced you've worked with clients you
10:57 - can actually lead them through a project
10:59 - and you are filling up your time you are
11:03 - booking
11:04 - basically based on yours you're selling
11:06 - your services based on the time that you
11:08 - it takes you to produce or the
11:10 - deliverables that are produced with it
11:12 - and then after that
11:14 - the third stage of freelance is you're
11:17 - no longer
11:18 - selling your services based on
11:20 - the time and deliverables but the actual
11:23 - value that the clients are getting out
11:26 - of your services
11:28 - and
11:29 - that's when you are able to start
11:30 - leveraging your time where you actually
11:32 - start to
11:34 - start making more money than the time
11:35 - that you are putting in
11:37 - so that's kind of the third stage
11:39 - and
11:41 - i will say time versus leverage
11:43 - so
11:44 - there's also
11:47 - two ways of doing freelance where you
11:50 - are
11:50 - you're actually
11:53 - you have um the time that you put in
11:56 - is
11:58 - okay you can sell your services to a lot
12:00 - of clients
12:02 - and
12:03 - if you're just trying to make up the
12:05 - salary that you had
12:07 - given up then you basically are going
12:10 - from one boss who gives you a salary to
12:13 - a lot of bosses that give you a salary
12:16 - those clients
12:18 - like the
12:19 - the level of expertise that you have if
12:22 - you aren't
12:23 - leading them throughout the whole
12:24 - process through the sales and through
12:26 - everything else
12:28 - and the clients actually become your
12:30 - boss
12:31 - and you aren't your own boss
12:33 - as
12:34 - even though that
12:36 - it's flexible
12:37 - like you have the flexibility you have
12:39 - um
12:40 - you know you can set your own prices
12:42 - it's still there's this point where you
12:45 - know you go from having many bosses to
12:48 - being your own boss and actually leading
12:50 - the clients and
12:53 - you know showing them
12:55 - what the value is of your services and
12:57 - that's where you uh
13:00 - you start to sell
13:02 - not just the time and deliverables but
13:04 - the actual value and so um and so then
13:06 - you can start being your expert being a
13:08 - consultant
13:10 - to your clients
13:12 - and um
13:15 - i'll also say uh pricing
13:18 - like everyone gets very uh
13:21 - nervous about when they go to price
13:22 - their services but pricing is uh
13:26 - it's kind of it doesn't mean anything
13:28 - the actual price tag doesn't ever mean
13:30 - anything uh the same service that you're
13:32 - selling for five hundred dollars someone
13:35 - else is selling for ten thousand
13:37 - um some
13:38 - the
13:39 - websites that we were building for five
13:41 - thousand we learned some people are
13:42 - selling for thirty thousand um like
13:45 - there's no
13:46 - the actual price tag does not matter
13:49 - um
13:51 - now
13:52 - you can't like you can't just like kind
13:54 - of say i'm a freelancer i'm going to go
13:56 - sell my stuff for this much money like
13:58 - there is value that um you have to put
14:01 - into the product that is not
14:04 - based on deliverables or
14:06 - based on the
14:10 - um
14:11 - the time that you put in
14:12 - the actual
14:14 - value that you're able to add
14:16 - is uh
14:18 - is a little bit more if you can make
14:20 - that results based
14:22 - um actually we'll just move on to number
14:23 - three number three if you can understand
14:27 - value of your services
14:28 - um in the value it comes when
14:32 - you have a
14:34 - let's say you have a client
14:36 - and you
14:37 - can see like where they're at where
14:39 - they're struggling
14:40 - and hit on those pain points like okay
14:43 - you obviously need
14:45 - the exact thing that i am doing here
14:48 - um
14:49 - and then talk to them about like what
14:52 - what is their benefit what um
14:55 - what is
14:56 - where does this service get them like
14:59 - what are their goals
15:00 - um what are the emotions tied to you
15:03 - know being a little bit more free like
15:06 - having a lot more flexibility with their
15:08 - website or
15:09 - being able to bring in more leads
15:11 - through their website or
15:13 - if you're doing apps like what
15:17 - what money would they be able to bring
15:19 - in with those apps or what convenience
15:22 - is there if you can point out like
15:24 - they're struggling now they have a
15:26 - vision
15:27 - and they have a gap like so
15:29 - that's where your services go
15:31 - um
15:33 - and
15:34 - it's not necessarily about
15:36 - the time that you put in or the
15:39 - deliverable
15:41 - it's about you solving their problem and
15:44 - if you are the
15:45 - one to solve their problem
15:47 - then um then they're going to give you
15:49 - the money and if they believe that you
15:51 - are the only one who can solve their
15:53 - problem
15:54 - because you fully understand and they
15:56 - will because you fully understand what
15:58 - their pain points are then they're more
16:00 - likely to give you what you asked for so
16:03 - the price becomes
16:05 - um basically
16:07 - what you feel is
16:09 - worth the value to them
16:17 - it's not
16:19 - about
16:20 - the emotional benefits to value
16:24 - there are
16:26 - a lot of different pains that people
16:27 - have like um
16:29 - if you're working with business owners
16:32 - then a lot of their their pain is like
16:35 - they can't they have a bottleneck
16:38 - they can't continue to sell more or
16:42 - they have to
16:43 - um
16:46 - you know they're they're stressed
16:48 - they're over stressed they
16:50 - they don't have the systems in place
16:52 - that they need
16:53 - they don't have
16:55 - the revenue in place like there's a lot
16:57 - of pain there and it's not just business
17:00 - related all the time sometimes it's you
17:01 - know they're stressed they're overworked
17:04 - they
17:04 - their employees don't respect them or
17:06 - you know there's all kinds of things
17:08 - that you can find out that is
17:11 - a problem
17:12 - and then um
17:14 - they
17:15 - they are usually
17:18 - they have the pain and they're also
17:20 - making mistakes
17:22 - and you can tell them like what mistakes
17:24 - they are making
17:25 - you might
17:27 - lead them to
17:29 - through that conversation and ask them
17:31 - what mistakes they are making or
17:34 - or where they want to be instead of just
17:37 - putting up their defenses
17:39 - but
17:41 - and then lead them to their vision
17:43 - and their vision is usually something
17:45 - that brings them money
17:46 - something that
17:48 - lessens their stress
17:50 - and so is that if you can
17:52 - anchor your price
17:54 - to their emotions and the value to what
17:58 - they need instead of what you are
18:00 - needing
18:00 - and
18:02 - the money that you need to bring in
18:03 - you're going to kind of
18:05 - um
18:08 - it makes them
18:09 - think that you are here for them and it
18:12 - makes the project about their needs
18:16 - and not about you so even it's like
18:18 - count it's counterintuitive to make it
18:20 - all about them but that's really all
18:22 - that they care about and it also
18:25 - establishes trust in you
18:28 - they don't think that you're trying
18:30 - you're just out there to get their money
18:32 - they don't think that you're
18:34 - you know they don't think that you need
18:36 - them
18:37 - as much you know that you don't need the
18:39 - sale and that um creates establishes a
18:42 - lot of trust and money follows trust
18:45 - so um if you can get your clients to
18:47 - trust you
18:48 - and a lot of that is you know having
18:50 - good work and
18:53 - having
18:54 - good clients in the past but then if you
18:57 - can establish trust upfront with clients
19:00 - um
19:01 - that that like leads them to want to
19:04 - give you more money and the same is also
19:06 - true if you are
19:08 - doing freelance for a company
19:10 - a larger company except for their pain
19:12 - points are going to be different so if
19:14 - you're kind of filling um doing coding
19:16 - for
19:17 - a agency or something like that
19:21 - then um it's more about you know like
19:25 - they are needing someone who's
19:26 - dependable they're needing someone who
19:29 - can um get the job done on their
19:31 - timeline you know they just need to know
19:33 - that you are going to be present that
19:35 - you're going to get the job done and
19:38 - that
19:39 - you know
19:40 - their their problem is more about
19:42 - impressing their boss than it is about
19:46 - fulfilling the client's need
19:48 - although some of that is there too
19:50 - um
19:51 - so you just like kind of
19:53 - if you can
19:55 - uh instead of selling
19:57 - from your perspective if you can
20:00 - find out what their true needs are and a
20:02 - lot of that is just asking
20:04 - them questions that matter and
20:08 - you know don't be afraid to
20:10 - ask the questions that you need to know
20:12 - in order to price your services
20:15 - and
20:17 - the number four
20:18 - thing that kind of reaches across all of
20:22 - everything is confidence
20:24 - and if you have confidence in the
20:27 - service that you're providing
20:29 - if you can
20:31 - lead your client through
20:34 - through the whole process with
20:35 - confidence that you're going to get the
20:37 - job done
20:38 - so
20:39 - what we found is
20:43 - a lot of times when we would go and
20:45 - go into a first meeting where we're
20:47 - meeting and talking about um
20:49 - you know what what we're going to do for
20:51 - someone before we ever get the job
20:53 - is that
20:54 - the client themselves are not confident
20:57 - like they don't know that we can get the
20:59 - job done
21:00 - and people project feelings on people
21:04 - onto other people so their
21:07 - them feeling not confident
21:09 - um would show up and then we would start
21:12 - to feel less confident about what we
21:14 - were offering and it was kind of like
21:16 - this spiral downwards where like by the
21:19 - end they're just like well i'm not sure
21:21 - if
21:22 - the uh if seed is the right people for
21:25 - the job because they don't know if
21:27 - they're the right people for the
21:28 - job but um we found when we show up with
21:32 - confidence that that projects back to
21:34 - them
21:35 - and when we say like yes you obviously
21:39 - have a need here and it's our services
21:41 - that are going to help you
21:44 - get the results that you want
21:46 - and um
21:48 - when we showed up with that confidence
21:51 - then they just like it's kind of
21:54 - a peaceful feeling that they get that um
21:57 - they're like yes this is uh who we need
21:59 - and then we could quote them the price
22:01 - that we want
22:03 - and like it it doesn't matter
22:05 - um the actual price is anchored to the
22:08 - results anchored to our confidence and
22:12 - we could tell them
22:13 - you know whatever
22:15 - price it is and they would say okay how
22:17 - can i make this work
22:19 - instead of like no that's too much
22:22 - so um
22:23 - if you have and um i will say like as
22:26 - you're starting out
22:27 - if you can find confidence in one area
22:31 - of what you're doing like say you're
22:33 - good at
22:34 - um a certain
22:36 - type of product
22:38 - if you can kind of carry that and push
22:40 - your confidence to other places
22:42 - um you know find your confidence in one
22:44 - area and then use it you know with your
22:47 - clients um you can find your confidence
22:49 - here and then
22:52 - work to
22:54 - yeah just there's there's way if you
22:56 - have the confidence in one place then
22:58 - you can likely have find it in another
23:00 - place and you just have to find it
23:02 - and use it and
23:04 - i think when when you're starting out
23:06 - when you're still in that first phase of
23:08 - freelance where you're learning your
23:09 - product and learning how to work with
23:11 - clients um you can you can tell them
23:14 - like hey this is something you know you
23:17 - can work
23:18 - work out with them
23:21 - what price it needs to be i guess and um
23:24 - if you're if you're getting that project
23:26 - done
23:27 - like you can use that project to fuel
23:29 - your confidence for the next next
23:30 - project so it doesn't really matter like
23:32 - what those first few projects look like
23:35 - as long as you're kind of like
23:37 - making sure that your goal is confidence
23:39 - in the product that you sell
23:44 - that's that's kind of like our four
23:46 - things and i'll open it up to
23:48 - questions so
23:51 - if you if you have any questions about
23:53 - any specific things in freelance i'm
23:56 - happy to answer
24:04 - good um
24:18 - he's asking with contracts if we have um
24:22 - any specific payment schedules or
24:24 - anything that we've learned about
24:26 - contracts
24:28 - so um
24:30 - with contracts
24:32 - and i will say like there's there's two
24:34 - parts of contracts there is the
24:37 - statement of work
24:39 - and that which is we basically turn the
24:41 - proposal into the statement of work
24:44 - and then there's a terms of service
24:46 - and the terms of service is something
24:48 - that we we went to a lawyer for um but
24:51 - there are terms of service online
24:54 - and um
24:55 - ours is ours is probably very specific
24:58 - to
24:59 - design and front-end web development
25:03 - but that statement of work
25:05 - outlines
25:07 - kind of the scope of the project
25:09 - and it outlines
25:10 - the payment schedule and really
25:16 - it just kind of um
25:18 - depends on what you want to get paid but
25:21 - i would say
25:22 - get paid as much as you can up front
25:26 - we we started out doing 50 50 and
25:29 - clients were always pretty happy with
25:30 - that now we try to do 100 up front but
25:34 - we'll work with people if they need to
25:36 - schedule out their payments
25:39 - and it we kind of let them bring it up
25:41 - we don't um
25:43 - so if it's
25:45 - uh right now our our package price is
25:47 - 5500 it's like an eight week program
25:49 - where we do consulting um for e-commerce
25:52 - companies and
25:54 - we uh
25:56 - we say hey it's 5500 and they say
25:59 - do you
26:00 - can i schedule that out and say yes what
26:02 - are you thinking
26:03 - and then they'll say okay can i split it
26:05 - into two payments and then yeah yeah
26:08 - that works
26:09 - or sometimes they'll ask for three
26:10 - payments like yeah that works
26:12 - we don't
26:13 - like for them like we're not a bank so
26:16 - we don't want to be scheduling out
26:18 - payment plans for people they could go
26:20 - to the bank they can put it on a credit
26:21 - card and get payment plans that way
26:25 - but as far as as far as money goes like
26:28 - you
26:29 - cash flow is
26:30 - extremely important for freelancers and
26:34 - if you are putting a lot of work into a
26:37 - project where you get paid up front and
26:39 - then paid at the end
26:41 - that cash flow like will dip
26:44 - each month and be irregular so if you
26:46 - can't
26:47 - collect all the money that you need then
26:50 - um it's just a very unsure way of doing
26:53 - business i guess
26:57 - um
27:00 - we
27:01 - we don't do as many contracts anymore
27:05 - well we don't do as many statement of
27:06 - works oh i will say um
27:09 - there is this there is a
27:11 - contract online
27:14 - so one thing that we've stopped doing is
27:16 - we've stopped listing the deliverables
27:19 - in our contracts
27:21 - because we are
27:23 - results focused and we've always we've
27:25 - always said that we price on value which
27:26 - is not true um we've always
27:29 - pretty much just
27:30 - priced on what we need to make
27:33 - and
27:34 - when we started pricing on
27:37 - the value
27:38 - and
27:39 - like the results that people get
27:42 - then we were also
27:44 - when we when we were doing that and then
27:46 - still listing the deliverables in the
27:48 - contract
27:49 - then people it still looks like your
27:52 - pricing based on the deliverables they
27:54 - get which doesn't always make sense
27:56 - because you know we don't
27:58 - i mean until like that first few
28:00 - meetings we don't even know like exactly
28:02 - what the client needs i think that's
28:04 - very true for scoping on code
28:07 - as well like you get into a project and
28:09 - realize like oh crap this looked really
28:11 - simple but it's not like that's going to
28:13 - take a few more weeks and so if you are
28:16 - listing out the deliverables
28:19 - and not basing your price on results
28:22 - then um
28:24 - for one you're probably undercutting
28:26 - yourself up front
28:28 - and um not not leaving room for there to
28:31 - be the extra time
28:33 - um
28:35 - or
28:36 - you know you just uh
28:39 - yeah it's you're nodding your head are
28:40 - you
28:42 - i agree
28:53 - yes
28:57 - right and that's he was saying um
28:59 - yeah you kind of uh build yourself into
29:02 - a corner and don't allow yourself to
29:04 - pivot and that's very true that's what
29:05 - we were finding in our cl in our
29:07 - contracts is we would say oh um we can
29:09 - do this and this and this for you and
29:11 - then when this and this wasn't
29:14 - we would we would do those things and
29:16 - then it wouldn't provide the results and
29:18 - they were and then we would come back to
29:20 - the client and say actually um
29:23 - you don't you don't need this it turns
29:25 - out you need this and we've already lost
29:27 - that trust that needed to be there up
29:30 - front
29:31 - and so you actually build a lot of front
29:33 - of trust up front
29:35 - if you can say we don't know what you
29:36 - need we need to do we need to like dive
29:39 - into your business
29:40 - and um and learn what you need and then
29:43 - we can build out
29:44 - and um some people also do like uh
29:47 - a discovery package discovery is kind of
29:50 - a
29:51 - buzz buzzword but
29:54 - where you know you take two weeks
29:56 - and really dive in to what they um what
29:59 - they're doing they are paying for that
30:01 - and they can take
30:03 - um
30:04 - your kind of prescription and go you
30:07 - know take it to someone else or they can
30:08 - stay on and take and
30:10 - you know have you do the work but um
30:13 - those two weeks are
30:14 - it's a lot of research on your on your
30:16 - part
30:17 - and
30:18 - it also kind of sets up your project for
30:21 - success so you're not like prescribing
30:23 - anything before you actually know about
30:25 - their business
30:27 - and so having the discovery up front and
30:29 - then
30:30 - doing all that stuff in the background
30:32 - but
30:33 - is that
30:36 - any other questions
31:13 - [Music]
31:14 - the question was how do i
31:16 - or what is my advice for someone who's
31:18 - working on fiverr or some of the
31:22 - gig development sites and moving to
31:25 - doing their own
31:27 - um work i guess building their own
31:29 - business
31:30 - is that kind of what yeah
31:33 - um
31:35 - i'd say for one you
31:37 - [Music]
31:39 - you aren't completely like you are
31:42 - learning how to do this
31:44 - um if you are
31:46 - learning how to work with clients then
31:48 - that's not a bad way to start
31:50 - because that does give you leads to
31:52 - begin with
31:56 - but
31:58 - to make the jump i think you still have
32:00 - to understand
32:02 - like one detach from
32:04 - that's going to be really hard to detach
32:06 - from uh if you're selling your services
32:08 - for so much little
32:10 - amounts of money and building those
32:12 - larger company businesses
32:14 - selling your own services you have to
32:16 - realize that um
32:20 - you know someone is charging fifty
32:22 - dollars for whatever
32:24 - that someone else is charging five
32:26 - thousand for that same work like if you
32:28 - can realize like you can get that larger
32:31 - amount of money
32:32 - and realize that like that's not
32:35 - the fiber does not um
32:38 - define
32:39 - your business
32:41 - that um
32:43 - there's a lot more potential
32:46 - just like making the um
32:48 - being able to jump
32:50 - is is kind of like you do have that
32:52 - capability to jump
32:54 - and so you should take it i guess
32:57 - um
32:58 - don't let like that mindset hold you
33:00 - back
33:01 - and um
33:02 - i'd say you still have the work you
33:04 - still have the confidence that you built
33:06 - from that and you can use that to
33:08 - put towards your
33:10 - future clients
33:12 - there is you also have to
33:14 - learn how to get those clients and a lot
33:16 - of that is you know talking confidently
33:18 - about their needs and talking
33:20 - confidently about like what they're
33:21 - struggling with
33:23 - and then
33:25 - you know making it like you're the one
33:27 - service that you like the service that
33:30 - you provide is the answer to their
33:31 - problems
33:33 - so kind of learning how to get clients
33:36 - through the way that you talk about your
33:38 - services
33:39 - they don't just show up at your door
33:42 - so
33:44 - yeah did i
33:45 - answer
33:47 - call
34:03 - yeah um
34:05 - so referral is a good way to go
34:06 - especially if you have a history of
34:08 - clients that love you
34:10 - that's a
34:11 - a great way to stay
34:14 - afloat
34:17 - and you want that so that you want kind
34:19 - of that base
34:20 - uh if you don't have
34:22 - clients that have trusted you in the
34:24 - past then it's hard to get future
34:26 - clients to trust you
34:27 - um
34:29 - but
34:30 - steven and i right now are using
34:32 - facebook to get clients
34:34 - and um
34:36 - that is kind of a
34:39 - a very new thing like that's a this year
34:41 - thing since we've hired this consultant
34:44 - and
34:45 - it works
34:46 - but basically with any social media
34:49 - um any profile like if you are talking
34:52 - about your service your expertise and
34:54 - kind of the pain that like the mistakes
34:56 - that people are making
34:58 - um that gets people curious
35:00 - it um it gets
35:03 - it gets them kind of interested in what
35:04 - you're saying and then you need a way to
35:07 - get people to see that and uh what we do
35:09 - is we go into facebook groups
35:11 - and you know post there and um we're
35:14 - going to be using facebook ads we
35:16 - haven't gotten there yet we're getting a
35:17 - lot of great feedback without doing ads
35:20 - right now
35:21 - um
35:23 - and so if you can same with linkedin
35:27 - if you can
35:28 - you know prime your profile like like
35:30 - this is what i do this is my expertise
35:33 - and then um go find people that are your
35:35 - ideal
35:36 - um
35:38 - customer
35:39 - and then they see like if you
35:42 - one of the things that you do have to do
35:44 - is like if you can pinpoint exactly what
35:46 - their needs are and pinpoint who your
35:49 - customer is
35:52 - like just the the way you can talk to
35:54 - them like they automat if they can
35:56 - automatically say like oh this is
35:58 - exactly what i need
35:59 - then
36:01 - you're halfway there
36:03 - so
36:07 - any other questions
36:23 - you're not might
36:33 - okay you might be on the side okay for
36:35 - the camera um sorry um well i was just
36:37 - going to add that when we first got
36:39 - started like you might not have that
36:41 - knowledge base to communicate with
36:42 - people a lot like i literally we printed
36:44 - off business cards and i was walking
36:46 - around to small businesses saying hey i
36:48 - make websites here's you know so you got
36:50 - to do what you got to do at the
36:50 - beginning
36:52 - to kind of build up your experience if
36:54 - you don't have any client work at all
36:56 - you could start off like talk to some
36:58 - small non-profits or something and just
37:00 - volunteer to help them out like hey i'll
37:02 - build you a website for free and then
37:04 - you'll always have that work to refer
37:06 - back to you i just was making sure like
37:08 - there's kind of an intermediate step
37:09 - there where you kind of scramble around
37:11 - and learn what you're doing while you're
37:12 - trying to talk to people
37:14 - basically if people know they have a
37:16 - problem and they know that you solve it
37:18 - then the more people you meet that have
37:21 - a problem the more you're going to find
37:24 - that want you to solve the problem so
37:27 - it is kind of a numbers game where if
37:29 - you can just
37:30 - meet more people who have
37:32 - problems and make it make them realize
37:34 - like you can help them
37:36 - and not it doesn't have to be like a
37:38 - slimy
37:39 - sales
37:40 - salesy thing yeah
37:44 - good good
38:14 - is
38:28 - yeah um
38:30 - and your question was
38:32 - if i can sum them up for the camera um
38:36 - if
38:36 - yeah if we can
38:39 - it's hard to find a niche up front until
38:41 - we've done the work to decide
38:54 - we did not know our niche up front we
38:56 - actually we worked with a score mentor
39:00 - about a year and a half ago
39:02 - and she advised us to niche down
39:05 - and so that's when we started realizing
39:08 - okay well this is the work we enjoy
39:10 - doing let's
39:11 - let's continue
39:13 - to narrow it down and we spent like a
39:14 - year like actually
39:16 - narrowing down onto e-commerce
39:18 - we had just decided like consumer
39:21 - products or um
39:23 - and that kind of thing and a lot of that
39:24 - was like our own expertise that kind of
39:27 - developed in
39:28 - in what we liked to do
39:30 - that helped us narrow down
39:33 - but um i will say like if you are able
39:35 - to
39:37 - narrow down your target
39:40 - um your ideal customer
39:42 - for one
39:44 - like that makes it easier for them to
39:46 - realize that you are
39:48 - the one person that can help them
39:50 - and it also makes your work easier like
39:53 - if you're able to systemize the stuff
39:56 - that you do
39:57 - that means that you're
39:59 - able to
40:00 - leverage your time
40:02 - and charge more
40:04 - based on their results so you're not
40:06 - charging based on your deliverables and
40:09 - the time that you put in
40:12 - then then you
40:13 - like just having being able to repeat
40:16 - the work that you're doing and sell it
40:18 - again and again
40:20 - if there's any part of your process that
40:21 - you can do that for then you're not
40:24 - starting over from scratch for each
40:26 - client
40:27 - it doesn't take like
40:28 - 16 weeks to get it done
40:31 - it's
40:32 - it's something that you can
40:34 - make money and sell so
40:36 - niching down is actually a really
40:39 - um
40:40 - it makes it fun to be honest i mean it
40:42 - was fun to kind of explore our talents
40:44 - at first whenever we were learning like
40:46 - what we can do
40:49 - but now i i get i just enjoy being able
40:52 - to help more people
40:54 - and i can help more people if
40:56 - if i can sell them the same thing over
40:58 - and over again
40:59 - so
41:02 - yeah
41:04 - any other questions
41:10 - if um
41:12 - how far
41:14 - have you guys gotten with your coding
41:17 - like um
41:18 - only a few people have started freelance

41:43 - if you are able to
41:46 - freelance for people and
41:49 - start selling your services that's a
41:51 - really fast way to learn
41:54 - um

42:02 - client like hey this is a learning
42:05 - process every every project is different
