00:01 - we are live welcome Kevin thanks a lot
00:06 - Quincy how's it going it's going great
00:09 - so Kevin is an amazing communicator and
00:14 - teacher he is the founder of RTF manual
00:20 - do where he creates amazing analogies
00:24 - for programming concepts he also has
00:26 - really awesome interactive tutorials
00:29 - that you should check out I've linked to
00:31 - all those below but let's talk a little
00:35 - bit about you man so Kevin you started
00:38 - out as an environmental science and
00:39 - entrepreneurship major at U Michigan and
00:43 - you you joined to startup and you had to
00:48 - basically learn how to do software
00:50 - development right off the bat tell us a
00:52 - little bit about that
00:53 - yeah sure so I was a liberal arts guy in
00:56 - school he said when I was school out at
00:59 - Michigan and actually right out of
01:01 - university I founded a company called
01:04 - diverging with a technical partner and
01:07 - what ended up happening was you know we
01:09 - were two 22 year old guys he was
01:11 - fortunately a computer science major and
01:14 - what ended up happening was you know
01:16 - we'd over it into it and we quickly
01:19 - realized that the backlog was stacking
01:21 - up and my partner's Key's skill set was
01:24 - back-end and we kind of looked at each
01:25 - other and said you know we can wait for
01:28 - a while to get the front-end right or we
01:31 - can find some other way to get around
01:32 - this and I said you know if this is the
01:35 - one thing that matters most and that's
01:38 - gonna help move us forward then I'll
01:39 - learn some code so I jumped in I started
01:43 - with resources like code Academy code
01:45 - school I don't think there was free code
01:47 - camp at that point or if there was I
01:50 - didn't know about it and you know just
01:53 - started teaching myself being a CEO
01:55 - during the day and trying to move the
01:57 - business forward and then learning at
02:00 - night and what would happen was I would
02:02 - you know try to do as much as I could
02:03 - between the hours of 7 p.m. and 1 a.m.
02:06 - let's say I would come back you know
02:09 - having learned a few things but
02:11 - struggling with a bunch more
02:13 - you know put some stuff in front of my
02:15 - partner and he would help me out and
02:16 - then eventually I got there but it was a
02:18 - very much like a trial and error
02:20 - experience and a lot of you know this is
02:23 - the same struggles that everyone goes
02:24 - through when they learned to code but
02:27 - I'd say for me you know one of the big
02:28 - things was knowing that the next day I
02:30 - was gonna go and look my partner in the
02:32 - face and have to tell them about you
02:34 - know what progress I made and like you
02:36 - know how I'm gonna solve the problems
02:37 - for the business so that's a pretty big
02:39 - motivator well you know it's just two
02:41 - people in a room basically Wow
02:44 - so to recap you you basically put
02:46 - yourself in a situation where you're
02:47 - forced to rise to the challenge jump
02:51 - right in and the well-being of your
02:54 - venture is largely contingent on your
02:57 - own ability they to grok a lot of these
02:59 - concepts and apply them yeah yeah yeah
03:04 - and just the cycle of you know learn a
03:06 - few front-end skills improve the user
03:09 - interface do a user test and realize how
03:11 - far I still have to go and then you know
03:13 - pick up the next few things so it was it
03:15 - was you know learning it in real time
03:18 - for sharing so you're now at an another
03:21 - company um but on nights and weekends
03:25 - you put on your back cape and you run
03:30 - our TF manual die oh yeah this is an
03:33 - amazing collection of analogies many of
03:36 - your analogy articles which we published
03:38 - on free cooking at medium convocation
03:40 - and they've been extremely popular how
03:42 - did you decide to go out and teach
03:46 - coding yeah so I started at this new
03:51 - company June last years I've been here
03:54 - about eight months and I was kind of
03:56 - thinking about you know the challenges I
03:57 - had learning to code obviously on nights
04:01 - and weekends in the first place and I
04:02 - said there's an internet full of content
04:04 - out there and there's sites like free
04:06 - code camp and code Academy and all that
04:08 - but still a huge struggle you know what
04:10 - are all these sites what are they not
04:12 - covering why is this still so
04:14 - challenging and I just thought about
04:16 - what I you know I have a marketing
04:18 - background and I thought about what I
04:19 - could personally offer and I just try to
04:21 - take it from a different approach you
04:23 - know I was and maybe you experienced
04:25 - this as well Quincy a lot of
04:27 - resources on the internet try to explain
04:28 - technical terms with other technical
04:31 - terms and it just you end up reading the
04:33 - article like four times over before you
04:36 - may or may not get it and I said you
04:39 - know for a beginner I just have to to
04:41 - set that frame of reference like what
04:43 - are people even looking at and I wanted
04:46 - to avoid you know they can always learn
04:48 - the technical terms later I wanted to
04:50 - find a way to make it really clear and I
04:52 - thought you know just a couple creative
04:54 - ways to do that I didn't want to be just
04:56 - another guy writing content on the
04:58 - Internet and I said you know a lot of
05:00 - times analogies help people so what if I
05:03 - just strictly focused on analogies and
05:05 - put a lot of effort into building great
05:07 - analogies and making that the core focus
05:10 - and so you know like any entrepreneur
05:12 - what I did to test it was I just the
05:14 - first article I made was called
05:16 - JavaScript callbacks explained using
05:18 - minions and so it's for people that you
05:21 - know after you're an experienced
05:23 - developer callbacks make a lot of sense
05:25 - but for any newbie it can take you a
05:28 - while to get it and it's obvious after a
05:29 - while and I said alright let's just put
05:31 - this out there and see what happens and
05:33 - I got considering that was my first
05:35 - piece of content that I had ever really
05:37 - posted it got a pretty strong response
05:39 - got a bunch of people sharing on you
05:41 - know Twitter I said I might be onto
05:43 - something here and then you know after
05:45 - that I was able to reach out to yourself
05:47 - you know who was really nice and letting
05:51 - me post in the free code camp
05:53 - publication and a couple other people in
05:55 - at places like site point and whatnot
05:57 - and they all loved the concept and I was
05:59 - like I guess I'm onto something here so
06:01 - it was really nice to have that
06:03 - validation from people like yourself but
06:05 - it was started with just you know I
06:07 - think this might be interesting but I'll
06:08 - you know try to write one of them and
06:10 - see what happens yeah and since then
06:13 - you've written a wide variety of
06:15 - analogies just off the top of my head I
06:17 - can think of a lot of them you explain
06:19 - CSS using an ice cream sundae yeah yes
06:24 - yeah popular you arrived a model view
06:28 - controller using yeah drinks at a bar
06:31 - yep and and some of these people just
06:34 - write to me and say like finally I get
06:37 - it like I wonder what the heck the
06:39 - relationship behind betwee
06:41 - these things was and now yeah I'm I'm
06:43 - working with it I envisioned myself
06:44 - manipulating a Sunday that's what I'm
06:51 - looking for I guess the way I thought
06:54 - about it it's kind of like exactly what
06:56 - you said like people understand these
06:58 - relationships between existing things
07:00 - like an ice cream sundae or an ordering
07:02 - a drink at the bar and I didn't want to
07:04 - try to teach coding as an entirely new
07:06 - system and say oh yeah there's these
07:08 - highly technical things and here's what
07:10 - they do because that's when it gets
07:11 - exhausting right I wanted to say hey it
07:14 - just fits into this system that you know
07:15 - and all you have to do is learn the
07:17 - syntax and stuff like that and go from
07:20 - there and a lot of technical writers I
07:22 - can say this because I I read maybe a
07:25 - hundred articles holy medium publication
07:29 - and a lot of people like will use
07:32 - they'll use a lot of jargon and the
07:35 - point to other articles and at some
07:37 - point my question for them is why should
07:41 - people read your article instead of just
07:43 - going and reading Wikipedia entry
07:44 - because that's what Wikipedia is it's
07:46 - basically exactly whole bunch of it
07:47 - early jar yeah but it's not particularly
07:53 - accessible to a newcomer exactly yeah
07:55 - yeah that's right and you've also
08:01 - created some interactive tutorials where
08:03 - you can actually go in and basically
08:05 - step by step you can interact with the
08:07 - analogies this is really cool and you
08:08 - did all the design of your stuff which
08:11 - is really impressive like all the assets
08:13 - you see when you go to RTF manual do
08:18 - those assets were created right here by
08:21 - Kevin yeah exactly and the way I figured
08:25 - out if you know that might be worth my
08:26 - time was people would either send me an
08:30 - email or they would comment on the
08:32 - medium post and say wow this is an
08:34 - interesting article but I love it if
08:36 - there's a way that I could participate
08:37 - in it and you know make it interactive I
08:40 - said oh wow you know that's a good next
08:42 - step because that's a more active
08:45 - learning method it would probably be a
08:46 - little more fun for people to do it
08:48 - going along so I just said you know all
08:51 - right that's a good idea I'll find a way
08:52 - to do it and
08:54 - so what you're describing is essentially
08:59 - like Lean Startup methodology right Leah
09:02 - the people who are using your product
09:04 - and making product design decisions
09:06 - based on that feedback yeah exactly and
09:09 - especially with something that seems
09:10 - this crazy right you know at the
09:11 - beginning I was like am I just insane or
09:13 - is this actually gonna help people and
09:15 - the easiest way for me to that quickly
09:17 - validate that was you know just putting
09:19 - out one block and then what I found was
09:22 - you know from reaching out to people
09:23 - like yourself and a couple features at
09:25 - like General Assembly and first step
09:27 - coding they all said oh we try to
09:30 - integrate analogies into our lessons and
09:32 - this is just like brings that to a whole
09:34 - new level so that you know the experts
09:36 - were already doing it and it fits in
09:40 - exactly with what they do so how do you
09:43 - come up with the analogies like you just
09:45 - sit in the bathtub and rock back and
09:46 - forth how does it happen
09:50 - there's like there's the different
09:52 - phases in it it goes through my head as
09:55 - well because I'll you know think of a
09:57 - concept like CSS positioning that I want
09:59 - to explain and sometimes it can take a
10:01 - couple days and I like creep into the
10:02 - self-doubt phase though there's no good
10:04 - way to do this and then inevitably I
10:06 - find something and honestly it you like
10:10 - from the creative process you just have
10:12 - to like get yourself in different
10:14 - situations and pull your brain different
10:16 - ways and I'm trying to think if there's
10:18 - one way that I do it I you know I play
10:20 - soccer so I like play soccer and then
10:22 - think about it on the train ride home
10:23 - pace around my apartment but it takes a
10:26 - while like there there's definitely a
10:28 - creative process and I'd say the biggest
10:32 - thing you know you know like if I decide
10:34 - if something's good enough an allergy or
10:36 - not is I really feel like people have to
10:39 - understand the different pieces they
10:41 - have to understand the relationships
10:43 - between different pieces and these
10:45 - aren't one-dimensional analogy is where
10:47 - it's just like I'll give an example out
10:49 - of people say like variables are like a
10:51 - bucket where you just plop a value in
10:53 - bucket and all that that's true that
10:55 - doesn't tell you anything about like the
10:56 - relationship between the entire system
10:58 - so the one biggest you know parameter I
11:01 - use is can people understand the
11:04 - relationships between the elements in
11:05 - the system like an ice cream sundae
11:07 - people know the
11:08 - the scoops the cherry these people
11:10 - understand how those things relate to
11:12 - each other right and that's the key to a
11:15 - good analogy as opposed to analogy that
11:17 - just kind of falls flat like what I
11:18 - would call like a low effort analysis
11:28 - even the bucket level is more helpful
11:31 - than trying to like explain an a
11:33 - variable in a very technical way right
11:35 - even a bucket is better than then trying
11:38 - to make it a big technical system but
11:40 - I'm trying to agreed so I mean I applaud
11:44 - their effort but they need to go the
11:45 - next level and hopefully people won't
11:47 - have to reinvent these wheels hopefully
11:49 - they'll just use some of your amazing
11:50 - analogies love this yeah incorporate it
11:52 - into you know courses exactly University
11:56 - classes and stuff yeah so let's talk
11:59 - about your motivations and aspirations
12:01 - behind creating this projects you
12:03 - already have a full time job going home
12:06 - nights and weekends and you're thinking
12:07 - of these crazy analogies and you're
12:09 - questioning your sanity while you're
12:10 - thinking about stuff like that
12:13 - talking company a little bit about how
12:15 - how you decided to do this and what gets
12:18 - you up and going every day
12:20 - yeah I the way here's the way I think
12:22 - about it and you know how I think it
12:24 - might be able to help people most
12:25 - directly is what would happen when I was
12:28 - starting my previous company was I would
12:30 - come home after you know doing business
12:32 - stuff and that like 7:00 p.m. start
12:34 - trying to learn code and then by 1:00
12:36 - a.m. I need to go to bed it would always
12:39 - be very unclear if I got anywhere on any
12:41 - given night and sometimes we run into a
12:43 - roadblock and you just say oh wow now
12:45 - I'm gonna have to wait till tomorrow to
12:46 - get my partner to explain this to me
12:48 - because I have no idea and a lot of
12:50 - people don't have a technical partner
12:51 - you know they can sit down with and get
12:53 - an explanation from and so what I wanted
12:56 - to do was bring in some sort of
12:58 - predictive quality of just saying you
13:00 - know what if I if I'm working from 7:00
13:03 - p.m. to 1:00 a.m.
13:04 - I better get something out of it you
13:06 - know I better learn something and so I
13:08 - was thinking of if I can set this
13:10 - expectation in someone's head like
13:12 - callbacks if they just have an idea
13:14 - where the callbacks thing is going
13:16 - they're much more likely to like feel
13:18 - they're progressing along their coding
13:20 - journey as opposed to Jess oh man I'm
13:22 - running into a roadblock I don't know
13:24 - you know what the next step is or if I'm
13:26 - even thinking about this correctly but
13:28 - they can say you know what if I put in
13:30 - the hours here I'm gonna get somewhere
13:31 - so that was kind of the motivation for
13:33 - me and and you know at a greater level
13:35 - it's creating a different a different
13:39 - way to learn I'm not sure how to put it
13:41 - well I talked about the neuroscience
13:44 - behind it now yeah because like the the
13:47 - human brain is essentially like a
13:49 - relational engine and that's how we yeah
13:51 - it is through relationships literally
13:53 - neurons connecting with one another yeah
13:57 - and this is something that I learned
13:58 - midway through the process that
13:59 - encouraged me to keep on doing the weird
14:01 - little analogies is what's a call it's
14:04 - called is associative memory and so your
14:07 - brain it makes a lot easier to recall
14:10 - information if it's stored in a system
14:12 - and what I thought was like when you
14:14 - know you traditionally teach a new
14:16 - coding topic let's say CSS positioning
14:18 - you teach it one by one people would say
14:20 - hey this is what position:absolute is
14:22 - missus what relative is and just like go
14:25 - at it one by one and what I wanted to do
14:27 - is quickly get all those relationships
14:29 - into people's brains at once and so it's
14:31 - much easier for them to recall later and
14:34 - what I realized was that the analogies
14:36 - that's why people like them so much is
14:38 - because it already taught them those
14:40 - those relationships they didn't have to
14:43 - form them themselves and like magically
14:45 - discover it they could just say oh yeah
14:46 - now I understand you know how these two
14:48 - things relate do you have any any
14:53 - specific advice for people who are
14:55 - learning to code maybe little tricks to
14:57 - leverage the neuroscience to to learn a
15:00 - little bit faster in terms of little
15:04 - tricks begin using my tutorials is the
15:07 - best I have right now I'm trying to you
15:11 - know like a better expert on this meat
15:13 - than me might be Tim Ferriss or
15:15 - something like that but the biggest
15:18 - thing for me it's kind of like the
15:19 - difference between memorization and
15:21 - understanding is you can like pack
15:23 - together and user interface let's say
15:25 - and like you know build it once but if
15:28 - you want to like feel like you have a
15:29 - grasp for some
15:30 - you're gonna have to understand it
15:32 - eventually and so I just think that you
15:35 - know it just depends where you want to
15:37 - cross that that bridge you know you're
15:39 - gonna have to fill that understanding
15:41 - and I think it might be better to do it
15:43 - upfront and really try to understand the
15:46 - whole system when you can but otherwise
15:48 - you might say yourself out for a long
15:51 - like facing one challenge at a time
15:55 - right and I think that it's extrinsic
15:58 - pressure putting putting yourself in a
16:00 - situation where people are depending on
16:01 - you to learn effectively it was a
16:04 - technique to kind of coerce yourself and
16:07 - still hurting faster I would say the one
16:09 - biggest thing is just like have a
16:11 - project that you're motivated to move
16:13 - towards and that you want to see happen
16:15 - and that's for me you know it was
16:17 - obviously in my business is that I guess
16:19 - I could wait for a long time for my
16:21 - technical partner to get to that part or
16:24 - I could just say you know this is the
16:26 - one thing that's holding our business
16:27 - back I need to learn and so for me you
16:30 - know just just putting it right into a
16:32 - project and and something that I that
16:35 - meant a lot to me that was everything
16:37 - because otherwise you know those those 7
16:40 - p.m. to 1 a.m. nights become really
16:42 - exhausting and that's the one thing that
16:44 - really pushed me forward was focusing on
16:48 - you know that that goal that me and my
16:50 - partner were building and based on your
16:57 - experience teaching yourself were there
17:01 - any strategies you found in addition to
17:04 - applying these analogies that just
17:06 - really helped you understand and and
17:09 - learn yeah I I really like the active
17:14 - active learning methods you know just
17:18 - like doing something like free code camp
17:20 - or code Academy or any of those but
17:22 - something that's going to get you
17:23 - immediately involved and I think I like
17:27 - what free code camp does with you know
17:29 - the community of being able to show it
17:31 - to someone and say hey we're a community
17:33 - of people that are even if we're
17:35 - accomplishing small projects where we're
17:37 - moving along so I would say that's a big
17:41 - thing like do not put yourself in a
17:44 - and say I'm not opening at this door
17:45 - until I know code because Yahoo that
17:49 - will be a challenge but I think you know
17:52 - just finding different reinforcements or
17:54 - things you can feel good about you know
17:55 - just just finding successes along the
17:58 - way that's that's everything because in
18:00 - my case you know the success might have
18:03 - been getting a user interface or a
18:05 - wireframe ready to be tested with users
18:08 - and of course it would get thrown right
18:09 - back in my face right the users would be
18:11 - like this isn't good but I was just
18:13 - proud that I had something that they
18:14 - could use and I could get feedback on
18:16 - and move my project forward and that's
18:18 - that's huge you know the after that I
18:20 - can take that constructive criticism
18:22 - until the next thing so you know having
18:25 - that kind of intermediate goal that's
18:26 - really important right on so just to
18:29 - recapitulate what you said just having
18:31 - basically having kind of psychological
18:33 - checkpoints you cross and getting
18:36 - feedback and not putting yourself in the
18:38 - peroneal room so there was a great
18:41 - question on Quora somebody asked how can
18:43 - I learn to code in one day and the
18:46 - answer was hilarious it's like go
18:49 - directly to the North Pole and prop up
18:52 - your chair in your satellite internet
18:53 - connection you have three months of day
19:00 - find a place for a three month day yeah
19:04 - so it's important I mean I'll just I'll
19:07 - just totally echo what Kevin said it's
19:09 - absolutely important that you get
19:11 - involved and you get feedback from
19:12 - people and that you don't you know the
19:15 - Chinese have a very important expression
19:17 - that I always like to cite quad mutton
19:21 - haiku our zeta Plumbing's ITER
19:24 - which means to close the doors and to
19:27 - build the chariot indoors of course you
19:30 - never know if your charity is actually
19:31 - good and so you take it out and you
19:33 - drive it but yeah this one guy from
19:36 - Chinese Lord just spent months and
19:38 - months building this chariot and of
19:40 - course the second he took it out to
19:41 - drive it it just fell apart yeah you
19:44 - know if you're not constantly getting
19:46 - feedback and asking people for input and
19:48 - things like that you're you're kind of
19:50 - building the chariot behind closed doors
19:51 - yeah what's on the what's on the agenda
19:57 - Woori what are your top priorities with
20:00 - our TF manual right now yeah so I
20:02 - definitely want to cover more topics of
20:05 - you know the basics whether it's from
20:07 - JavaScript CSS I've got a sequel article
20:10 - coming up I've got to get one like a git
20:14 - very basics coming up but I think the
20:18 - greater thing is to just turn those into
20:20 - interactive tutorials and something that
20:22 - someone can participate in like I just
20:26 - remember all the time struggling when I
20:28 - was learning of not understanding the
20:30 - system and I would do something silly
20:32 - like mix JavaScript and jQuery and my
20:35 - partner would go those are written
20:37 - differently you can't just throw those
20:38 - together just because it's all in one
20:40 - javascript file you know those are
20:41 - slightly different and you know just
20:44 - helping people along with interactive
20:47 - tutorials I think is the next big thing
20:49 - and and what I'm looking for is if that
20:53 - can actually help people learn faster so
20:55 - rather than you know searching for
20:58 - articles or you know trying to do
20:59 - whatever you can to find stuff on the
21:01 - Internet just saying you know here's a
21:04 - simple system that'll the tone for you
21:06 - and then after that it'll be a lot
21:08 - easier to learn like all the little
21:09 - technical nitty-gritty but just to have
21:11 - a level of expectation so I feel like
21:14 - the big idea here is it's starting with
21:17 - content but moving towards an
21:19 - interactive tutorial system that people
21:22 - can participate in and then feel good
21:24 - about the progress that they're making
21:25 - and understand that if they do put in
21:27 - the hours they'll get there it isn't
21:29 - just a series of running into walls
21:31 - right on well everybody be sure to check
21:35 - out some of Kevin's articles below I
21:37 - strongly recommend the CSS positioning
21:39 - with an ice cream sundae one of my
21:42 - favorites that's a great place to start
21:45 - and then just dive through as many as
21:46 - you're interested in doing you'll learn
21:48 - a lot of cool concepts in a lot of very
21:51 - memorable ways that'll any through
21:53 - familiar with the concept it might help
21:54 - further solidify it also below I've got
21:58 - a Twitter account for Kevin I strongly
