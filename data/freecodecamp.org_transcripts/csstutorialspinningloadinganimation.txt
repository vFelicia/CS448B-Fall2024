00:00 - Today we'll see how to create this spinning loading animation,
00:03 - using Pure CSS.
00:05 - And, uh, animations like this comes in handy many times,
00:08 - so we'll quickly see how to make one.
00:11 - So saying that, let's get into the code.
00:26 - So we have our basic instrument skeletal structure already.
00:29 - So I just create a  with a class container
00:32 - which is for the solely purpose to bring it to the center of our screen,
00:35 - and uh
00:37 - within this , I'll create one more  with the class loading
00:41 - where we are going to actually do the animation of loading.
00:44 - So  I'll do the CSS in this file only,
00:47 - so we're doing the style text.
00:50 - First I'll set margin and padding to zero for all the content,
00:54 - so I'll do asterisk, and within this I'll set margin and padding to zero.
01:01 - Next, let's start with a container.
01:04 - So we want to bring it to the center of our screen
01:06 - So I'll just do top to 50%, left to 50%,
01:10 - position to absolute
01:13 - and uh transform, translate -50%
01:16 - comma -50%.
01:18 - So we'll get it in the center of our screen.
01:21 - Now let's start with the loading.
01:24 - So I'll create a border of 6 pixel,
01:28 - solid,
01:30 - and a light gray color, so I'll give
01:32 - #ccc.
01:36 - And next, I'll give a width of 60 pixels
01:40 - and height of 60 pixels.
01:42 - So now if you'll save this,
01:44 - you will get the box on the screen.
01:47 - As we have a box,
01:48 - to convert it to a circle,
01:50 - what we have to do is we have to set the border-radius to 50%.
01:55 - So now we'll get it in the shape of a circle.
01:59 - Next, I'll just give a border-top-color
02:02 - and a border-left-color
02:04 - to a hex value, which will give it a green color.
02:07 - [music]
02:15 - Now, for the animation, we are going to use this animation property.
02:19 - So first is the animation name,
02:21 - so I'll give it a spin.
02:24 - Next is the animation duration,
02:26 - so I'll give off one second.
02:30 - And we'll give the animation iteration count to infinite
02:34 - so that it loops forever.
02:37 - And the animation timing function to ease-in-out.
02:43 - So after doing this, we need to set keyframes for the animation.
02:47 - So we'll use this @keyframes and pass the animation name, which is spin.
02:53 - So for the 0%,
02:57 - we will do this transform, rotate: 0 degrees.
03:02 - And for the 100%, we will change the transform to rotate to 360 degrees.
03:10 - [music]
03:14 - So after you save this, you will start seeing the animation.
03:19 - Now, this is just a basic one,
03:21 - but you can play around with these things and change some properties
03:24 - depending on how you want to show the animation for the loading.
03:27 - You can change the animation duration time,
03:31 - depending on how fast you want to show the animation.
03:34 - Now, if you want the same like I showed you in the preview
03:38 - where there were a couple of rotations between the starting and the ending point.
03:41 - the changes that you have to make is in the 100% keyframe.
03:45 - So if you change the rotate to 720 degrees
03:48 - then it is going to rotate twice before it comes to an end.
03:52 - So it will look something like this.
03:54 - Now, if you want to make the rotation three times,
03:57 - then you have to just multiply it by 3.
04:00 - So 360 multiplied by 3, it's 1080.
04:03 - So now it is going to take three rotations before it stops
04:06 - and then start again.
04:09 - So if you are doing something like this, just keep one thing in mind:
04:12 - you have to be in a multiple of 360 degrees
04:15 - because--let's say if I put any random value like 800...
04:22 - then you can see that it kind of lags before it starts again for the rotation,
04:27 - so it doesn't look good.
04:28 - So if you want to go it smoothly,
04:31 - then you just want to keep it in the multiples of 3.
04:34 - And you can change the animation duration
04:37 - depending on how fast you want to do it.
04:39 - So this basically ends the tutorial.
04:42 - And it's quite easy and quite helpful also if you want some loading animation before showing some content.
