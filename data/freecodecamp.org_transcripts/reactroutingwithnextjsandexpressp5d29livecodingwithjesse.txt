00:02 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:04 - with jesse
00:06 - today i want to show you
00:08 - a pull request
00:10 - that was made that fixed
00:13 - the little issue that we had yesterday
00:15 - at the end of the stream
00:16 - and they were going to work with
00:19 - that new
00:20 - component that we made so we have a new
00:23 - component a new query and a new way to
00:25 - do routes
00:26 - that'll save us
00:28 - from having to make so many different
00:30 - components and queries so we're going to
00:31 - do a few
00:34 - uh a few routes with that
00:36 - and
00:37 - it should work right if it works once
00:40 - then it should work with the other ones
00:41 - but
00:42 - you know we'll just we'll make sure and
00:45 - we'll build some of those out we'll see
00:46 - how we look and
00:48 - i want to share with you kind of the the
00:50 - next stage
00:52 - of this
00:53 - that probably won't work on until later
00:55 - on in the year
00:57 - uh but it'd be good to
00:59 - you know just
01:01 - get everybody on board and see what you
01:03 - all think about it
01:05 - so i just had a meeting this morning
01:06 - where we discussed some things
01:09 - uh for the the future of this website
01:13 - that's not even done yet but we're
01:14 - already thinking about more
01:18 - so
01:21 - hey everybody
01:22 - see some of you in the live chat
01:24 - hey
01:25 - all right harshit's here good so harshit
01:27 - is the one that actually made the pull
01:29 - request so i'm glad that horseshoe is
01:31 - here and that way if i mess things up
01:33 - when i'm trying to describe what he did
01:36 - uh he can let me know
01:38 - i have ngrok running i'm going to paste
01:40 - that into the
01:42 - live chat now
01:45 - and i may have to paste it again after a
01:47 - while if we get some more viewers
01:49 - uh it looks like i'm i didn't get the
01:51 - stream scheduled until a little bit
01:53 - later today so
01:55 - not everyone you may have gotten the
01:57 - notification
02:00 - um because i'm seeing
02:02 - in the analytics there's not too many
02:03 - people in here yet
02:05 - and we're missing some people that are
02:07 - usually here
02:09 - um but it looks like at least some of
02:11 - you are getting on
02:13 - uh the ngrok server
02:15 - that if you're not familiar with ngrok
02:17 - that link will allow you to see on in
02:19 - your browser
02:21 - what i have here running locally on my
02:23 - computer
02:26 - so
02:27 - let's get started
02:32 - and i'm going to
02:36 - first go over that that pull request
02:39 - that i was telling you about
02:41 - so you can see this is what we were
02:42 - trying to get to display yesterday
02:45 - and
02:46 - it is displaying properly now
02:50 - so here's how it was done
02:53 - and you can check out these pull
02:54 - requests requests in more depth
02:58 - uh
02:59 - in the repo so if you check the link in
03:02 - the description for this github repo and
03:03 - you go in there and you look at the
03:05 - latest closed pull requests
03:07 - the last two that i closed
03:10 - were
03:11 - both from harshad so i believe it was
03:14 - whatever the second to the last one was
03:16 - that was the one
03:21 - um let's see
03:23 - all right alexia i see your question
03:25 - i'll get to it in just in just a minute
03:30 - all right where we at page okay so this
03:32 - is the right component
03:35 - so
03:37 - you can still see the old way that we
03:39 - were doing queries and some of the other
03:41 - components if you if you want to go back
03:43 - and check that out you can but here's
03:45 - the latest so we upgraded to
03:48 - the beta version of
03:51 - apollo
03:54 - to this react apollo
03:58 - um
04:01 - sorry i'm just getting myself familiar
04:03 - with what we did so obviously we're
04:04 - importing query now which we didn't
04:08 - we didn't have before and some of this
04:09 - we we had already worked on before the
04:11 - stream ended yesterday but so we're
04:14 - bringing in query
04:16 - and then we're using this query
04:18 - component down here
04:21 - so
04:23 - we're calling page query
04:26 - right which we made here right so here's
04:30 - our page query component
04:33 - and we can take a variable that's a type
04:35 - and a variable that's the name
04:37 - all right so we're passing it this
04:39 - variable type
04:42 - and that just means the
04:44 - the post type
04:46 - so we have all these different custom
04:48 - post types running in wordpress and we
04:50 - have graphql
04:51 - the wp graphql plugin running
04:54 - so we want to get the right post type
04:57 - and that's what we pass in here and then
04:59 - we pass in the variables
05:02 - and
05:02 - as name we're passing in the id as well
05:07 - and that will get
05:08 - a certain
05:10 - post of that particular post type
05:15 - and then horseshoe also
05:16 - you know has in here you know some
05:20 - loading
05:21 - something to display if there's an error
05:23 - which is awesome
05:26 - and if we do get the data back
05:28 - then we just you know display it
05:31 - as you know we're normally doing for
05:33 - most of the components we're just
05:35 - displaying the the base content here
05:39 - and you see now we have none of the
05:40 - stuff down the bottom that we did have
05:42 - all of it's moved up in here
05:44 - i think this is really nice this is
05:48 - obviously coming from doing it the other
05:49 - way this way it looks a little odd to me
05:52 - because i learned the other way first
05:54 - but
05:55 - trying to just think of this
05:58 - more objectively here i think the query
06:01 - component
06:03 - is is it's much more obvious what's
06:05 - going on here
06:07 - i don't know if maybe it's just me you
06:09 - all let me know what you think but i i
06:11 - kind of i really like it it's
06:15 - i mean we have
06:17 - a queer component and we're making a
06:19 - query and then we're getting we're
06:21 - getting the result
06:22 - and we're doing something with that
06:26 - i don't know that makes sense to me
06:29 - so anyway
06:30 - that's really cool essentially we have a
06:33 - pretty simple component here but
06:35 - i suppose if you needed to fill in
06:37 - different places with with data you
06:40 - would just add them all in here so the
06:41 - query essentially would be kind of a
06:43 - wrapper
06:44 - around your whole component
06:46 - in this case we we don't really need
06:49 - that
06:50 - for everything
06:53 - although
06:54 - you know potentially we'll see maybe you
06:56 - know depending on what we do
06:58 - later on with the site we might need
06:59 - something like that but anyway i like it
07:03 - i really like that
07:05 - and
07:08 - yeah
07:10 - cool good job harsha harshad also did a
07:12 - few other things so if you want to check
07:14 - that out um you know go ahead in the
07:20 - um in the repo
07:24 - i keep forgetting that
07:25 - it's called a repa
07:27 - so i said it already three times and
07:29 - every time i was like um
07:31 - uh repo
07:33 - uh okay let's see
07:37 - let me go back to the live chat now
07:40 - before we get started with coding
07:46 - all right so alexi had a question about
07:49 - the style uh how did you style the
07:51 - underline in the text field on the
07:53 - search
07:54 - and so the text field for search
07:59 - this would be easiest just to see
08:02 - so
08:03 - when
08:06 - let's see if we can
08:09 - focus yeah
08:11 - i believe that's it
08:16 - no that's not on this element it's on
08:18 - this one
08:25 - hmm it's not going to show
08:33 - i don't know which element it's on now
08:36 - so one of these elements has
08:39 - i believe it's a it's the bottom border
08:45 - now i can't even remember
08:47 - sorry
08:48 - sorry alexi
08:51 - is that it
08:56 - it's not the whole li
09:07 - hmm anyway i'm
09:10 - maybe gonna have to check that out
09:13 - oh harsh it's says it's a mature ui
09:15 - component oh you know what our yeah
09:18 - for some reason i was thinking of the
09:20 - old um
09:23 - what's it called um
09:27 - materialize
09:28 - i was thinking the old materialized
09:30 - components and how we did it with that
09:32 - yeah so
09:33 - but basic if you wanted to do this on
09:35 - your own with css
09:37 - you could do this and create an
09:39 - underline
09:42 - and then just add i mean we that's
09:43 - probably what
09:45 - one or two pixels i mean it's really
09:46 - thin
09:48 - and then just on focus
09:50 - you would have the color change
09:53 - so i have done that before with
09:57 - just plain css you know if if i need to
10:00 - work on something where i can't import
10:03 - like materialize or material uh ui
10:07 - then that's usually how i do it it's not
10:10 - exactly
10:12 - the effect so let me zoom in here and
10:14 - show so if you decide to do just the
10:16 - plain css underline it's nice you don't
10:18 - have to use any javascript but you don't
10:20 - get exactly the same effect so if you
10:22 - notice here it's very subtle and fast
10:25 - but
10:26 - it spreads from the interior to the
10:29 - sides
10:30 - even when we when we click out of it you
10:32 - see it comes back in
10:34 - so it's a little bit more involved than
10:36 - just changing it
10:38 - right
10:41 - and and that's closer i bel it's been a
10:43 - while since i've looked at the material
10:44 - design documentation but i believe that
10:47 - this is closer to the way it is supposed
10:49 - to be
10:52 - so
10:54 - but
10:56 - it's it's almost i mean it would take
10:58 - somebody who really paid attention to
11:00 - that kind of thing to notice the
11:01 - difference if you were to just put the
11:03 - underline there
11:06 - anyway
11:07 - so hopefully that
11:08 - at least cleared up some of how we did
11:10 - that
11:23 - oh okay was it
11:26 - tim says he styled the before of the
11:28 - search container
11:33 - no anyway
11:37 - yeah in this case it's used the the
11:39 - materialize component is being used so
11:41 - i'm not exactly sure how that is
11:44 - happening
11:46 - but i do know how you can get a similar
11:47 - effect with the css
11:57 - all right cool john hanson said that the
11:59 - new way that harsh it's set up here
12:02 - um is is a lot cleaner so yeah i
12:05 - definitely agree
12:06 - harshit also
12:08 - says that this is bleeding edge
12:12 - and um he had to set up a babble plug-in
12:14 - to get this to work
12:17 - okay
12:18 - so
12:21 - yeah thank you for mentioning that yeah
12:23 - so since
12:24 - this is the the beta version right so
12:27 - it's not
12:30 - i guess normally you you would want to
12:32 - use stable versions for something in
12:34 - production
12:35 - i'm okay with this uh number one like we
12:38 - still have
12:40 - over a month until we were launching
12:42 - this so
12:44 - i mean it's possible that this stuff
12:45 - could get
12:46 - moved over
12:48 - uh into
12:49 - a stable release before then
12:53 - but also i'm
12:55 - i don't know i'm a little bit more open
12:57 - to using
12:59 - you know the beta version of things
13:04 - so i i guess it'll
13:08 - i guess it'll work out
13:10 - i hope it'll work out but i i think
13:12 - we've done it before on other projects
13:14 - uh so i'm okay with it
13:18 - obviously you know we're just gonna keep
13:20 - you know we're gonna test everything and
13:23 - make sure that that it all works but
13:25 - hopefully it all works i really like
13:27 - this solution
13:30 - and
13:31 - let's
13:34 - get started
13:37 - i don't know what's
13:39 - i might need new batteries in my
13:40 - trackpad i'm just having
13:42 - weird issues right now with my trackpad
13:45 - so sorry if i seem distracted that's
13:46 - that's what's distracting me i'm trying
13:49 - to test out
13:50 - my track pad it just seems like
13:54 - it just keeps cutting out but i'm not
13:56 - getting a low battery warning or
13:58 - anything
14:01 - yeah it's it's showing the battery just
14:04 - being fine
14:05 - that's that's just really odd
14:29 - okay
14:32 - well let's get started then and work
14:33 - with this let me remember to set my
14:35 - timer this time
14:36 - i'm going to pull it over onto this
14:38 - screen so you all can see it as well
14:40 - and
14:44 - we're going to set this
14:46 - for 25 minutes i'm going to work on this
14:48 - and then we'll take a break
14:50 - i'll go back to the live chat
14:52 - um i don't know we may only do one one
14:55 - coding session today i still have a lot
14:57 - of data to transfer over and it seems
15:00 - like
15:01 - now that we have this component all
15:03 - worked out it's going to just be a lot
15:05 - of repetitive things
15:07 - so
15:09 - may not be the
15:11 - it may not be interesting enough to do a
15:13 - lot of coding with so
15:15 - maybe we'll spend more time on the
15:17 - question and answer today uh we'll just
15:19 - see how it goes i mean this is all
15:21 - assuming that i don't have errors or
15:22 - anything which when does that ever
15:25 - happen
15:27 - okay
15:33 - let's see what we need well we're going
15:35 - to be working mainly i suppose in our
15:38 - server.js
15:40 - file today
15:42 - okay
15:43 - uh by the way if you do
15:46 - clone this repository
15:49 - if you've already cloned it make sure
15:51 - when you pull in changes
15:53 - that you do install the new dependencies
15:56 - so we've we've updated packages
15:58 - yesterday and harshit has added
16:00 - things in
16:02 - and
16:03 - made some changes uh to to babel so
16:08 - things will not work right unless you do
16:12 - an npm install or you just yarn
16:16 - so make sure you do that
16:18 - and restart the server if you already
16:20 - have it running
16:24 - all right so let's go right here
16:26 - where are we at is this the one
16:28 - i want to find the one that we just used
16:30 - that worked
16:32 - was it about
16:34 - yeah
16:35 - so we're going to use this same
16:38 - one as is almost you know like a
16:40 - template
16:43 - and let's go in here and
16:47 - set up some more post types so on my
16:49 - other screen
16:51 - i'm going to check
16:52 - our wordpress installation
16:55 - just to see what post types
17:01 - i have
17:02 - created and i don't think that i've
17:05 - imported all the data for all these
17:06 - types we'll go ahead and make the routes
17:08 - anyway
17:10 - you know we'll need to make them at some
17:11 - point so we may as well make them now
17:22 - all right i i do have a route that is
17:31 - about
17:36 - hmm
17:48 - okay so we have a page
17:50 - for
17:51 - our chapel
17:54 - so we do uh this is a catholic
17:55 - university so we have a chapel on campus
17:58 - and there's a lot of stuff that goes on
17:59 - there so we have a whole set of pages
18:01 - just for the chapel and all the things
18:03 - that that go on there
18:06 - so
18:08 - i believe
18:09 - about pages
18:12 - yeah it'll be chapel pages
18:15 - that should be the correct
18:17 - type
18:19 - chapel id page
18:21 - all right wonderful
18:23 - and
18:24 - i guess i can check
18:26 - see if we have data over here oh i
18:28 - didn't actually pull in those pages yet
18:30 - so we're not going to be able to test
18:31 - that
18:32 - so let's move on
18:34 - let me find one that i know i did have
18:36 - data for
18:38 - okay great so we also have
18:41 - academics pages
18:44 - and i would i need to start thinking
18:46 - about and if anybody has ideas let me
18:48 - know
18:48 - ways to clean this up this server.js is
18:51 - getting big
18:53 - i mean we've done more in server.js when
18:55 - we handle some
18:57 - you know like file uploads and different
18:59 - things
19:00 - so it's gotten messier than this before
19:03 - but i think that we can definitely clean
19:05 - it up so we talked about it before but
19:08 - it's getting to the point now where we
19:10 - could probably benefit
19:11 - from cleaning it up
19:13 - so let's change chapel to
19:16 - academics
19:19 - and now i think we can test this so let
19:22 - me just get the slug of
19:25 - one of these
19:30 - and if if any of you want to see like
19:33 - what i'm doing in wordpress on my other
19:34 - screen let me know really i'm just
19:37 - i'm just copying and pasting some stuff
19:39 - so
19:40 - it's not a big deal but i'm definitely
19:42 - willing to put it over on my screen if
19:44 - if you all think it would be worth it to
19:46 - see
19:46 - so when we do this we do need to restart
19:49 - the server
19:50 - so let me do that now
19:56 - i thought we set it up somewhere in some
19:59 - project to where
20:00 - we it would automatically restart the
20:02 - server for us if we saved
20:05 - i'll have to go back and check out
20:07 - you know maybe some of the package json
20:09 - files in previous projects because i
20:11 - don't remember exactly which one it was
20:13 - but since we're doing so many changes to
20:16 - our server dot js file then
20:19 - maybe it might save some time and be
20:20 - worth it
20:22 - for now though let's test this out
20:27 - so we're gonna do academics slash we're
20:30 - gonna go to the austria courses offered
20:32 - page
20:35 - no
20:36 - nothing all right well it's it's
20:38 - actually really cool that
20:41 - we didn't get an error i like that
20:49 - let's see if i
20:50 - spelled everything correctly academics
20:53 - pages academic okay
20:55 - um
20:59 - that is the slug actually of course is
21:01 - offered
21:08 - i wonder
21:13 - i'm just double checking to see if maybe
21:15 - there was some data and for some reason
21:17 - it's not being displayed
21:23 - yeah it's not being offered okay so
21:26 - what's the problem here
21:28 - or i'm
21:29 - i didn't what did i say offer this it's
21:31 - not being
21:32 - being shown something's wrong
21:54 - all right
21:56 - let's figure this out i think we have a
21:58 - css issue and
22:00 - our data is actually coming through i'm
22:02 - really glad that i
22:04 - i decided to look at that so if you
22:06 - remember when we were bringing in this
22:07 - data we were keeping all of the markup
22:10 - as is from the old database
22:13 - because that was going to give us a huge
22:16 - advantage in in speed we don't want to
22:19 - keep the markup like that ideally
22:21 - you know we would clean it all up at
22:24 - some
22:24 - point but that can be done later after
22:27 - we launch
22:29 - unfortunately sometimes we have
22:31 - weirdness like this that we have to deal
22:33 - with where content's just not
22:35 - displaying properly
22:40 - all right
22:48 - i think i set up
22:52 - all right so the way i handle stuff like
22:53 - this and other components is either i
22:56 - change the css well or both but
22:59 - or i've i've set up
23:02 - a like a little
23:04 - uh function that just
23:06 - changes the
23:10 - what did we do
23:11 - we ended up doing a regular expression
23:13 - right i think horseshoe you helped out
23:14 - with that so that was what we did we did
23:16 - a regular expression that matched up
23:17 - what we were looking for and then
23:19 - changed it so in this case like we don't
23:22 - want another title tag so we would
23:24 - change this to some sort of h tag
23:28 - in fact let's try to do that now see if
23:30 - we can get something to show up
23:32 - uh let's try an h2 for this
23:35 - all right we're still getting nothing
23:39 - let's see
23:47 - that's really weird what's going on
23:54 - display none all right the root is set
23:55 - to display none oh okay i see
23:58 - uh for some reason
24:01 - i was setting root to display none
24:05 - for a news.css
24:11 - that's really weird
24:15 - all right so okay so we do have
24:18 - something right we've changed this to an
24:20 - h2
24:22 - so we have our tabs
24:24 - uh so we have tab content okay and more
24:27 - titles
24:29 - yeah this definitely needs some work wow
24:40 - wow okay
24:49 - yeah this content needs cleaned up for
24:51 - sure
24:53 - let me look at some other content within
24:56 - the same post type if it's something
24:58 - that's consistent throughout
25:00 - then
25:01 - we'll find a way to deal with
25:03 - deal with it a lot if it's just
25:05 - something that's happening for this one
25:06 - piece of content then that'll be
25:09 - something that we can manually change or
25:11 - have someone else manually change it
25:19 - all right let's see
25:22 - i saw uh
25:24 - and and andres
25:26 - let me know if i'm pronouncing that
25:27 - wrong but it looks like andres says hi i
25:29 - love your live streams they're awesome
25:32 - uh
25:34 - thanks for saying that i really
25:35 - appreciate that uh and there was an
25:37 - exclamation point at the end i probably
25:39 - didn't sound too excited when i say it
25:40 - but it was there
25:42 - but anyway thank you so much for
25:44 - watching and saying that
25:49 - all right let me find
25:51 - another
25:52 - piece of content here
25:59 - all right let's check out the content
26:01 - for online programs
26:13 - all right cool so the online programs
26:15 - content is coming through and it doesn't
26:18 - look too bad i mean i
26:21 - i definitely don't want to leave it just
26:22 - like this but this is not that bad
26:27 - all right great
26:29 - cool
26:31 - so maybe i'll have to take a look more
26:34 - at the structure some of this content
26:41 - oh
26:42 - sorry that was a big yawn
26:45 - wow this is like three days in a row now
26:47 - i've just been getting
26:49 - tired right at this point in the day and
26:51 - yawning
26:54 - all right so
26:56 - yeah i'm gonna just i'm gonna need to
26:58 - take a look at this
26:59 - actually
27:01 - this might be a good task for
27:03 - someone else to do like a student worker
27:09 - i'm just i'm not trying to push off all
27:11 - my stuff onto student workers but at
27:13 - this point i need to make sure i use my
27:15 - time you know very wisely to get
27:17 - everything done before launch
27:20 - so if there's some task that
27:22 - you know seems like it wouldn't take
27:24 - very much
27:25 - you know special knowledge of web
27:28 - development to do
27:30 - then that's a task that i could easily
27:33 - you know give to
27:35 - to anyone else who can do you know basic
27:37 - kind of data entry work
27:40 - okay
27:42 - so that essentially
27:44 - works right we're in the sense that
27:46 - we've set up a route and it's pulling in
27:49 - the data it's utilizing our page
27:51 - component and our page query
27:53 - that's what we wanted
27:55 - so
27:56 - let's check out our another post type we
27:59 - have admissions pages now which we have
28:02 - no content for but i can at least make
28:04 - the route
28:05 - and we've confirmed that this route does
28:07 - actually work now so we've got it to
28:09 - work with about pages and we've got it
28:10 - to work with academics pages
28:16 - so we should be able to use the same
28:19 - pattern
28:25 - admissions pages and
28:27 - so my my kind of strategy for organizing
28:30 - this content now is to go by
28:33 - um
28:38 - i guess like i don't even know if it's
28:40 - department it's not exactly a department
28:42 - but
28:44 - i'm trying to group things by
28:49 - kind of like larger
28:51 - i i you could say department right i
28:53 - mean academics i guess isn't but like
28:55 - chapel ministries i guess is what we
28:57 - call that department here and we do have
28:59 - an admissions department so
29:01 - we'll have we have certainly faculty
29:03 - departments but even within like the
29:05 - university their staff department so
29:07 - we're going to have one for
29:08 - uh human resources so actually i could
29:12 - probably do that as well so we'll have
29:15 - human resources which i believe just is
29:19 - using hr so i think we're just going to
29:21 - keep the hr
29:23 - and then that way all the urls will
29:26 - match up
29:29 - so let's go
29:33 - human resources and we may have some of
29:36 - these already pulled in let me double
29:38 - check see if we can work oh cool we do
29:40 - have some so let's try
29:45 - we have one piece of content and the
29:47 - slug is strategic approach
29:50 - so let's see if that works
29:52 - we're gonna have to restart our server
29:53 - again
29:54 - unfortunately i saw harsha putting some
29:57 - things in the live chat about using
29:59 - nodemon to auto restart the server so
30:01 - that's it that that's what we were using
30:03 - before so
30:04 - uh i thought that was it but i wasn't
30:06 - sure
30:12 - sometimes when i think something is the
30:14 - thing i just don't say it for two
30:16 - reasons one
30:18 - better just stay quiet than to look like
30:20 - a fool on a live stream also if i say it
30:23 - then it's going to be in your mind and
30:25 - if i say the wrong thing then
30:28 - i will possibly have misled some of you
30:30 - so
30:33 - i appreciate when i get that
30:34 - verification from uh from some of you in
30:37 - the live chat
30:39 - all right so let's try hr strategic
30:41 - approach yay
30:43 - all right so that works awesome
30:46 - and
30:47 - this is so much faster so i if you
30:50 - haven't watched the last like week or
30:51 - two of streams remember we were for each
30:54 - one of these
30:55 - we would make
30:57 - so for every single one that we've just
30:59 - done here which we've done for
31:02 - we would have made not only this but
31:05 - also a new component and a new query
31:09 - so
31:11 - really really cool
31:14 - we've already just
31:16 - i mean so much time being saved here it
31:18 - looks like
31:19 - harsh it says there's some other stuff
31:22 - that might save a ton of time
31:24 - do type those pages down
31:27 - i'm thinking of serving type id
31:32 - okay so harsha's thinking of a way to
31:34 - save some time
31:38 - very cool
31:41 - all right cool let me know more of what
31:43 - you're thinking because i'm not
31:45 - saying thinking server do i get and then
31:47 - type id
31:50 - all right let me know more of what
31:52 - you're you're thinking there
31:58 - server.get
32:09 - nikki says now go to those pages on the
32:11 - live site get that endorphin hit because
32:13 - it loads so much faster
32:15 - yeah let's do that because that is going
32:18 - to be really fun
32:19 - so
32:21 - let's go to hr strategic approach so
32:24 - we've just gone to it here you saw how
32:26 - fast that was
32:30 - franciscan.edu
32:37 - oh
32:39 - that was really fast for this site but
32:43 - still just can't compare with this
32:46 - now obviously it's running locally but
32:48 - still
32:49 - still so much faster
32:52 - awesome
32:54 - and i think ultimately
32:56 - you know it looks nicer too
33:00 - you know even just the basics that we've
33:02 - done here
33:04 - it it just appears more readable to me
33:10 - all right cool
33:14 - harshit says we can make a universal
33:16 - route for this i saw a repetitive
33:18 - pattern
33:19 - all right that's that's cool i'm i'm
33:21 - definitely up for
33:23 - you know cutting this down even more
33:25 - let's see
33:27 - let me
33:28 - let's
33:29 - look
33:31 - at this camp security
33:33 - did i do a route for campus security yet
33:37 - no i didn't and i don't have the content
33:39 - migrated over for that either so it's
33:41 - not really a big deal
33:43 - we can do that route but i'm i'm really
33:45 - interested though in seeing how we can
33:50 - how we can make this a little easier
33:54 - so
33:57 - oh cool javascript is here hey how's it
34:00 - going
34:01 - thanks for watching
34:03 - and
34:09 - let's see
34:14 - all right harsh is saying can i use
34:15 - teletype
34:17 - yet uh let me open adam and see if i
34:20 - installed telesite
34:22 - i thought i had it installed when it
34:24 - first came out
34:31 - obviously i'll probably need to update
34:33 - it if that's the case
34:47 - all right i guess i don't have teletype
34:49 - installed
34:58 - all right so teletype's installing now
35:00 - on my other screen
35:03 - we'll see how long that takes oh cool
35:06 - that was really fast
35:17 - let's see
35:48 - all right i'm not
35:50 - learn more okay they have a link to
35:52 - learn more about how to do this
36:06 - all right let me pull over adam on my
36:08 - other screen
36:12 - and
36:13 - so everyone can see it
36:17 - so i've just installed that
36:19 - and let's open up
36:24 - add project folder let's add
36:27 - projects and
36:31 - franciscan site is that it
36:35 - yeah this is it
36:40 - yes
36:42 - let's do this
36:49 - and let's see
36:51 - we should have a new icon somewhere yeah
36:54 - there we go
36:57 - so it's just uh sharepoint works just in
36:59 - the way people join your full device for
37:01 - the new id maybe i should do this on my
37:03 - other screen because i think i'm gonna
37:04 - get a portal id
37:06 - and i don't want everybody on the
37:08 - project
37:28 - all right looks like i have to log in
37:31 - at teletype.io
37:41 - so
38:02 - good
38:16 - all right harshit i'm sending you my
38:20 - um
38:22 - my code or whatever on
38:25 - twitter
38:28 - all right there we go it's sent
38:35 - and let's open this up
38:38 - little
38:40 - server.js
38:51 - all right so
38:53 - hopefully that'll work uh for what what
38:56 - harshit's trying to do here
38:58 - uh let me know
39:00 - i i really don't know how this is
39:02 - supposed to work so
39:04 - maybe we'll see we'll see harsh it
39:08 - when he starts to work on this
39:11 - i'm not sure
39:13 - uh
39:14 - until then i think my
39:17 - timer is almost up so i'm gonna go back
39:20 - to the
39:22 - we're gonna put that timer all right
39:23 - yeah time is almost up
39:25 - so let me go to the live chat now
39:28 - and i'll go back over here in case
39:31 - horseshit starts doing something with
39:33 - this oh there we go i can see a little
39:35 - picture of harshit
39:37 - very cool
39:43 - uh so i'm gonna go to the live chat and
39:45 - answer some questions and then maybe
39:47 - we'll be able to see
39:49 - what's going on here cool hey all right
39:52 - awesome so this is hardship typing right
39:54 - now this is really cool it's the first
39:57 - time i've used uh teletype with atoms so
39:59 - this is like google doc style coding i
40:02 - suppose
40:04 - so let's
40:10 - yeah let's just watch this while i i'll
40:12 - scroll through and see if there's any
40:13 - questions i can answer
40:31 - okay cool heart i see what you had
40:33 - said about nodemon earlier
40:35 - uh that's cool maybe i'll have to get
40:37 - that set up
40:43 - oh nikki i see you asked earlier about
40:45 - that graphql issue yeah check out um
40:48 - harshit submitted some pull requests one
40:51 - of them
40:53 - fix that issue
40:55 - so if you want to see the code for it
40:58 - you can check that out i went over it
41:00 - briefly at the beginning so if you you
41:02 - know catch the um the recording of this
41:04 - you might be able to see that
41:11 - oh all right and uh harshit says it's pr
41:15 - 67 so pull request 67.
41:18 - all right so let's check till hardships
41:20 - made a universal route here so we're
41:22 - doing a server.get
41:24 - and then we have type and id
41:27 - rendering cache page
41:31 - type and then we're also passing in the
41:33 - type here
41:44 - you know what
41:46 - horseshit this is
41:50 - will this work with everything human
41:52 - resources
41:54 - this won't work with
41:57 - everything
42:06 - yeah actually so this will only work
42:08 - with certain
42:11 - types right so it's still going to save
42:12 - us some time but it won't work
42:16 - all the time
42:21 - so like for instance it wouldn't work
42:24 - with this human resources one right
42:26 - uh so we were past we're going to the
42:29 - route hr but then the type is actually
42:31 - human resources but with here it would
42:33 - be hr up here and then hr pages
42:37 - down here
42:39 - so i mean i
42:40 - if i really
42:55 - it's possible that maybe i could try to
42:58 - make
42:59 - a lot of things fit into this so we
43:01 - could use it more like i could go back
43:03 - and change the wordpress plugin
43:09 - let's see so we're saying for hr place
43:11 - it above
43:12 - if it will come first express will
43:13 - render it and ignore this i mean yeah
43:15 - that's what i was thinking so this
43:18 - we can definitely use this we just have
43:19 - to make sure that it's it comes last
43:24 - so this would work let's see what we can
43:26 - get rid of we could get rid of
43:29 - admissions
43:30 - academics
43:32 - chapel
43:34 - about
43:40 - so let's get rid of these right now
43:44 - and
43:47 - now
43:48 - let me restart the server we'll just
43:50 - test it i mean it should work
43:52 - but always good to test
44:01 - all right that should still work right
44:05 - no
44:07 - no did um i didn't flip the order right
44:16 - wait did i get rid of hr too
44:20 - i
44:20 - did
44:22 - sorry about that
44:25 - got rid of too much
44:29 - all right now let's restart this and
44:31 - start it back up
44:33 - good thing i checked that and i just
44:35 - assume that it would work
44:42 - um i was planning on using that pattern
44:45 - of saying like like academics pages
44:47 - admissions pages
44:50 - for a lot of the other
44:53 - different
44:54 - post types that i have to make so that
44:57 - it should automatically work for a lot
44:58 - of these which is
45:00 - really
45:02 - awesome all right so let's try
45:05 - let's just hit the back button
45:07 - and let's make sure that these are
45:09 - working so that's academics so that's
45:11 - now using
45:13 - this
45:15 - so that just came through here right
45:17 - because we're not actually saying
45:19 - academics anywhere that came through
45:21 - here and it worked properly
45:23 - awesome we go back another one
45:27 - okay this was the one that had problems
45:29 - like the date is there but there's just
45:31 - some issues with it displaying
45:34 - cool our about page
45:36 - still works
45:38 - so you can see we had taken out the
45:40 - about
45:41 - uh route there so it's hitting this one
45:44 - awesome
45:48 - all right that's really awesome so
45:49 - unfortunately because of just the
45:52 - because we have to match up how the urls
45:54 - are on the current site we're not going
45:57 - to be able to use this for everything
45:59 - there's just too much variety and how
46:01 - how that
46:02 - you know came through
46:06 - i mean it's
46:08 - like i said i'm gonna keep in mind this
46:10 - from now on and when i make new post
46:12 - types and bring things in i'll try to
46:15 - follow the same pattern so it works for
46:18 - as many things as i can make it work for
46:21 - maybe i i could probably switch up
46:25 - some things
46:27 - like hr
46:30 - the only
46:31 - thing that i
46:33 - it's going to be a problem
46:36 - are
46:37 - hyphenated things so
46:39 - if things are hyphenated for instance
46:41 - like campus hyphen security and
46:43 - hyphenated in the url
46:45 - i can't bring even if i were to change
46:48 - the post type to campus security pages
46:51 - it would still be campus hyphen security
46:53 - and i can't pass in
46:55 - a hyphenated thing
46:57 - this it makes an error with the wp
47:00 - graphql plug-in so it has to be camel
47:02 - case
47:03 - so
47:04 - those are the only ones that absolutely
47:06 - won't work for this
47:09 - almost everything else could work
47:12 - with the exception of
47:17 - i mean i guess we have minor
47:20 - but we don't have pages some of them
47:22 - just won't make sense to put pages on
47:23 - the end
47:25 - but we could potentially just to take
47:26 - advantage of using this
47:28 - for now i'm not going to worry about
47:29 - changing what we've already done because
47:31 - that's that's just going to be extra
47:33 - work we don't need to do it right now we
47:34 - can do it
47:35 - after the site launches
47:37 - or if we have time when we finish
47:39 - everything else
47:41 - but from now on i'm going to try to use
47:43 - this so thank you very much harshit
47:46 - since i ended up doing coding on my
47:48 - question time i'm going to go back to
47:50 - the live chat now and try to
47:54 - answer these questions
47:58 - okay
48:25 - uh okay uh nikki says might need some
48:27 - translation layer between the the type
48:31 - uh and the string passed into
48:34 - render and cache next to type so
48:40 - yeah that's
48:42 - that's right
48:43 - actually
48:46 - yeah why didn't i just think about that
48:49 - yeah we could do something where if
48:51 - there's a hyphen it changes it
48:56 - and i'm i'm sure there's a way that we
48:58 - could also capitalize
49:01 - you know the the second word
49:03 - as well
49:06 - okay
49:07 - so actu that is possible so something
49:10 - hyphenated it
49:11 - that's not really going to mess us up
49:14 - thanks for bringing that up nikki um
49:18 - it actually seems like yeah obviously we
49:20 - can manipulate strings in javascript
49:22 - like now that you say that i'm like what
49:24 - was i thinking but i really uh
49:28 - i think that's a good idea
49:38 - let's see
49:49 - the restaurants
49:59 - i lost my place in the live chat here
50:01 - sorry
50:06 - angel's here hey how's it going
50:10 - peter says i've been trying to follow
50:11 - along as much as possible but missed a
50:13 - lot of the beginning streams what's
50:15 - server.js okay so our our server.js file
50:18 - was we're using node.js which is
50:20 - javascript running on the server side
50:23 - sorry if you know all this i'm just like
50:26 - explaining as if you know it's it's
50:28 - somebody that doesn't know everything so
50:30 - please don't take it uh personally
50:32 - so
50:34 - it's javascript running on the server so
50:36 - right now what we're doing is we're
50:38 - listening for requests and then we're
50:40 - doing something based on that so if we
50:41 - get a get request
50:44 - to a certain route
50:47 - we're going to do something and what
50:48 - we're doing here
50:50 - is we're actually we're caching that
50:52 - request but and then we're rendering it
50:55 - um or
50:57 - reverse that right but
50:59 - uh we're sending it to the component
51:02 - that's the page component so page.js and
51:05 - then we're sending some variables so
51:06 - we're sending the id which is passed in
51:09 - here and we're sending the string human
51:11 - resources
51:12 - we actually worked on another way to do
51:14 - this that's that's a better way here
51:17 - this one's a little bit easier though
51:19 - for me to explain
51:21 - uh because they're less less variables
51:23 - going on
51:24 - so
51:26 - that's all we're really doing in this
51:28 - section of our server.js file
51:31 - uh we're just
51:32 - making sure that when a user comes to
51:34 - the site to a certain url
51:37 - the right components with the right
51:38 - information
51:40 - gets sent back to that user so the right
51:42 - thing renders on the screen
51:46 - let me know if that explanation was okay
51:48 - if you need me to explain some more
52:00 - alright rook says make a translation
52:01 - object pull the corresponding value from
52:04 - the key and pass that into
52:07 - the type
52:08 - in rendering cache
52:10 - then everything fits in the universal
52:12 - route
52:13 - do you use a
52:16 - you do use a translation object though
52:19 - okay harshit says this will not hurt you
52:22 - just have to follow a post type naming
52:24 - convention
52:25 - nikki says you can make it default to
52:27 - the way it's working now by using a
52:30 - logical or operator just thinking out
52:33 - loud here uh it will work right
52:36 - our says make route for that one
52:41 - that also fits in that method life and
52:44 - everyone's okay
52:45 - cool so
52:47 - uh nikki and harshit basically are
52:51 - still talking about uh these routes
52:53 - essentially
52:55 - there is a better way to do all this to
52:57 - cut down on the total amount of routes
53:00 - so
53:00 - again i'm going to say and i think
53:02 - they're saying a lot is before i said
53:03 - this before but
53:05 - i'm going to say for now everything
53:07 - that's there is going to stay there
53:09 - everything new that we add on i'm going
53:11 - to try to fit either into this route or
53:13 - into another
53:15 - like universal route so it's
53:18 - universal-ish right so it doesn't work
53:20 - everywhere
53:21 - um we're so either going to do that or
53:23 - we're going to have some type like nikki
53:25 - was saying of translation so that
53:29 - basically the type that gets passed in
53:31 - here gets transformed before it gets
53:34 - passed in here
54:04 - um
54:15 - okay harsha i see what you're saying
54:17 - about the javascript.af
54:19 - stuff yeah i'll um
54:22 - i'll make you a maintainer and you can
54:24 - like message me about that too on
54:26 - twitter or whatever and we can work all
54:27 - that out
54:33 - uh peter says okay cool i definitely
54:36 - need to jump into some node.js soon
54:38 - currently doing a codecademy pro
54:41 - intensive course for building web apps
54:43 - using react so i would guess node would
54:46 - be good to learn next
54:47 - yeah definitely i really like using node
54:50 - with react
54:51 - i i know you can use react with with
54:53 - other stuff uh but node just seems so
54:56 - natural uh since you're already using
54:58 - javascript like
55:01 - i don't know i i figured like why why
55:02 - not use full stack javascript if you're
55:04 - making web apps right like
55:07 - no sense bringing another language in
55:10 - i to me that just complicates things
55:12 - more unless there's some really good
55:14 - reason why you ought to use another
55:16 - language then
55:18 - just keep it simple with just one so i
55:21 - think node is great
55:30 - okay
55:31 - all right well i've gotten to the bottom
55:32 - of the live chat here
55:35 - and
55:36 - so i know we only really did one
55:39 - like coding session but we're already
55:41 - coming up on an hour
55:43 - of the live stream so i kind of
55:46 - went over into uh
55:49 - the
55:50 - a little longer than a 25-minute session
55:52 - so i think i'm going to wrap things up
55:54 - here
55:54 - um anahil says how can i help with the
55:57 - javascript dot af repo
56:00 - okay i'm going to say this i don't want
56:01 - to spend too much time talking about the
56:03 - javascript.af thing here uh because
56:07 - it's not like well number one i am i'm
56:09 - at work and the javascript out of af is
56:12 - a side project thing but the other thing
56:14 - is too like uh free code camp is you
56:16 - know non-profit so i don't want to bring
56:18 - bring something in that potentially will
56:20 - end up being for-profit into here
56:23 - so
56:24 - anybody that's interested in
56:25 - javascript.af
56:27 - check out my github
56:29 - so jesse r weigle i think is my github
56:33 - check it out
56:35 - you can bring up issues and things in
56:36 - there
56:37 - and we can just discuss it
56:40 - if we get a lot of people involved maybe
56:42 - we can find out a better way to
56:43 - communicate but i think for now github
56:45 - issues will work fine
56:48 - so right now i have two repos javascript
56:51 - uh hyphen af is one for the front end
56:55 - and then we had javascript
56:57 - af
56:58 - api which i don't think we're going to
57:00 - be using for back end stuff because i
57:02 - think we're going to use firebase
57:04 - so
57:06 - we may just be using the one so you know
57:08 - go ahead and check out the repo open an
57:10 - issue if you if you have questions or if
57:12 - you just want to let me know like hey i
57:14 - want to work on this
57:15 - that's cool
57:17 - and um
57:18 - let's see
57:20 - yeah right now it's really bare
57:22 - but we will be doing some things so
57:24 - basically something that would be very
57:26 - helpful right now is javascripter
57:29 - um has built out
57:32 - like front end
57:33 - all the design but it's not all
57:36 - reactified yet right so that needs to be
57:38 - changed into react components on the
57:40 - repository that resides on my
57:43 - uh
57:43 - my
57:45 - github profile so
57:47 - my account
57:49 - so
57:50 - maybe we could get something going maybe
57:52 - i'll make an issue or something with all
57:54 - the relevant information
57:56 - of you know bringing things over and
57:58 - then if you would like to help you can
57:59 - just pick some piece
58:01 - of the ui to turn it into a component
58:05 - and
58:06 - we'll i guess we'll go from there
58:09 - so
58:13 - let's see
58:16 - i think that's it
58:23 - all right
58:24 - okay cool
58:25 - so i had some other things coming up in
58:27 - the live chat but it's all javascript af
58:29 - uh things so
58:32 - they said just message me on twitter or
58:34 - something about that or put it in the
58:37 - issues in the repo
58:42 - let's see
58:43 - uh nirev says hello i am new to
58:46 - javascript i want to learn javascript
58:47 - from scratch and want to clear all
58:49 - fundamentals any suggestions
58:52 - you could check out
58:54 - well free code cam
58:56 - their curriculum will help
58:57 - their exercises so freecodecamp.org
59:01 - if you like books there's a book series
59:04 - called you don't know js and you can
59:07 - read it for free on github so if you
59:09 - just search you don't know js github
59:12 - it'll be probably the first thing that
59:14 - comes up
59:15 - you could read through those
59:17 - otherwise if you prefer videos i mean
59:20 - there are a ton of good videos but in
59:22 - particular beau has a whole series of
59:25 - introductory javascript and more
59:27 - advanced javascript videos here on the
59:29 - free code camp channel so
59:33 - you know check check those out if you
59:34 - can
59:35 - of course there's i'm sure there's
59:37 - probably an audiobook version of you
59:39 - don't know js as well if you prefer that
59:42 - but between those resources that'll be a
59:44 - good foundation for you
59:47 - so
59:48 - if anyone else has any suggestions
59:51 - please put them in the live chat there
59:52 - for uh for nirv
60:02 - oh cool um i should sound like using
60:04 - style components nikki says definitely
60:06 - want to learn about style components or
60:08 - definitely want to help awesome
60:19 - uh harsh saying we can't use jquery yeah
60:22 - yeah we don't want to use jquery for
60:24 - react for sure
60:36 - um okay i'm gonna wrap things up here if
60:38 - we want to continue the javascript af
60:40 - conversation somewhere else that's cool
60:43 - maybe i'll open some issues on github uh
60:46 - just to to get everything straight
60:49 - and
60:50 - i'm trying to think we can
60:51 - [Music]
60:52 - or else can we talk
60:55 - we do have
60:58 - the free code camp slack that we've
61:01 - created uh for the live chats i haven't
61:03 - actually checked into that slack channel
61:04 - in a while but
61:07 - uh we can also start a channel on there
61:10 - and
61:11 - talk about it more if you want so anyway
61:14 - let me know you know you all know how to
61:16 - get a hold of me all my social media
61:18 - stuff is out there so if anybody's
61:19 - interested in the project let me know
61:21 - somehow
61:22 - and we'll get it harsh it says a gator
61:24 - room would be good yeah a guitar room
61:26 - would be great as well so
61:28 - yeah we'll figure out some some better
61:30 - way of uh talking about this and then
61:33 - where we can all talk you know as a
61:35 - group i think would be
61:36 - good all right so
61:40 - i'm gonna wrap things up for today i'll
61:42 - be back tomorrow
61:44 - and
61:46 - i'm not sure what we'll be working on
61:47 - i'll try to think of something more
61:48 - exciting than just doing the same thing
61:50 - here and maybe maybe we can do some more
61:53 - work on the homepage and get that nicer
61:56 - i'd love to get that to a point where it
61:58 - really looks good we can start showing
61:59 - it off to people
62:02 - all right cool
62:03 - until
62:04 - then have a great day
