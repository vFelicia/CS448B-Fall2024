00:00 - prepare for the battle
00:04 - [Music]
00:17 - me
00:20 - [Music]
00:31 - wait a minute
00:35 - [Music]
00:52 - it's monday
00:54 - i started a new project the app is
00:57 - github battle it will be comparing two
00:59 - github users i'm building this project
01:01 - right now with the tutorial later i will
01:04 - style it and add additional
01:05 - functionalities but firstly let's build
01:09 - the basics today i was learning how to
01:11 - set up the webpack both webpack and jsx
01:16 - both of these things are recommended
01:19 - while working with react gs
01:32 - wait a minute
01:36 - [Music]
01:52 - right
02:01 - [Music]
02:06 - this
02:07 - [Music]
02:22 - yesterday i took part in front of malaga
02:24 - frankly speaking i thought i would learn
02:26 - much more about svg and d3 but still it
02:28 - was a nice introduction and simply right
02:30 - now i have to dig deeper into d3js and
02:34 - start building stuff with it the example
02:37 - that was presented during the meetup
02:39 - used for simulation it was pretty
02:41 - attractive but in order to understand
02:43 - more you simply have to get your hands
02:45 - dirty with the code
02:47 - and start building sometimes the all of
02:50 - these frameworks and libraries are too
02:52 - big
02:53 - and
02:54 - and they are not the most effective
02:55 - solution i'm learning a react in order
02:57 - to
02:58 - to be able to to wagon it to build
03:01 - bigger apps and use it when needed it's
03:03 - also the market that requires from you
03:05 - the frameworks and right now i'm
03:07 - practicing even the small apps in it but
03:10 - but the truth is that sometimes vanilla
03:12 - js would be the the simplest and the
03:14 - best option and it wouldn't wave so much
03:17 - so
03:18 - it's worth remembering while working
03:20 - with frameworks such as angular or such
03:22 - as react.js
03:29 - [Music]
03:45 - [Music]
03:49 - uh
03:56 - [Music]
04:05 - [Music]
04:25 - it's friday and the app is almost done i
04:27 - want to check it on various devices and
04:30 - browsers let's get back to work and
04:31 - let's start testing
04:39 - [Music]
04:48 - so
04:54 - [Music]
05:24 - this is how the app looks at the end of
05:26 - the week
05:28 - it's fully responsive
05:32 - on small screens uh horizontally
05:35 - the the home screen looks a bit
05:37 - differently in order to boost uh the
05:40 - usability
05:42 - the home screen
05:44 - is uh
05:46 - centered with flexbox
05:48 - so
05:49 - it's got a bit different layout than the
05:51 - rest of the screens
05:55 - you can enter two users and compare them
06:05 - [Music]
06:07 - you can start the bottle or reselect
06:09 - players
06:10 - uh let's start a bottle
06:12 - the loser is always a bit grayed out so
06:16 - i added the filter
06:20 - as you see
06:22 - here
06:23 - it's filter grayscale 100 and opacity is
06:26 - a bit lower than
06:28 - uh done one so it's zero seven
06:31 - in order to differentiate who's the
06:33 - winner
06:36 - and you can start over the game
06:39 - whenever a user
06:41 - introduces the names
06:44 - that are
06:46 - incorrect
06:48 - that are not present in on github
06:53 - they get a notification that warriors
06:55 - are misspelled and
06:57 - and they come back to player one screen
07:00 - so they are ready to introduce
07:04 - new players
07:06 - and start the battle
07:08 - [Music]
07:13 - the users chose the wrong players
07:17 - they can reselect them
07:23 - and start the bot
07:25 - i built this graphic using freepik
07:28 - and the whole idea for the app came from
07:30 - react training
07:32 - and that is linked here
07:34 - [Music]
07:36 - i also prevented the user from you know
07:38 - clicking enter going further or clicking
07:41 - continue without providing the username
07:45 - because it didn't make any sense
07:49 - when the players are the same
07:51 - the result is of course a tie so i still
07:55 - find it buggy to display it on edge and
07:58 - microsoft's
08:00 - internet explorer if anybody knows how
08:02 - to deal with it what's the problem
08:05 - i'm you know really open to the feedback
08:07 - in order to introduce the changes maybe
08:09 - i'll find it on my own too but so far i
08:11 - haven't i started working on this app on
08:14 - monday on the 7th
08:16 - of november
08:18 - and i started with setting up the
08:19 - webpack
08:21 - later a few comments later
08:25 - i styled it a bit more introduced all
08:27 - the functionalities additional
08:28 - functionalities
08:30 - and optimizations you will also find
08:32 - this link in the video description below
08:35 - so i will provide it for you if you uh
08:37 - if you want to play on the app
08:39 - the app is done of course you can
08:41 - iterate over it i want to give big shout
08:43 - out for react training i will put the
08:45 - link to their page in the video
08:47 - description below react training
08:49 - consists of much more courses
08:51 - this one that i was using github battle
08:54 - is for free so you can give it a try and
08:57 - later decide that you wanna buy the rest
08:59 - of the courses or not for me the big
09:00 - plus was that each step was introduced
09:03 - really uh in details so
09:07 - uh even if there was something new i
09:09 - didn't have to worry a lot because it
09:11 - was explained and and it was clearly
09:14 - explained the only thing missing there
09:16 - in this course was like setting it up to
09:18 - the production when i used npm run start
09:22 - for the development server for the local
09:24 - host the paths were a bit different than
09:27 - later in the production so i had to
09:30 - change that the paths
09:31 - in routing in order to make it work but
09:34 - i managed to do it so it's not a big
09:35 - thing next week i won't be vlogging
09:37 - because i will be moving out and
09:38 - changing flats so i hope to meet with
09:41 - you in two weeks time when i come back i
09:44 - want to work on react challenges from
09:46 - free code camp and i also want to
09:48 - practice more of vanilla javascript
09:51 - because still this is a thing that
09:54 - i want to come back to
09:56 - keep on doing stay motivated and see you
09:57 - in two weeks time
10:01 - [Music]
10:07 - you
