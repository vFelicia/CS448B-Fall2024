00:00 - my name is doji and i am going to go
00:03 - ahead and be giving you a talk on just
00:06 - some basics for web design some ways
00:08 - that you can get into it and some things
00:10 - that you can do so that it doesn't feel
00:12 - like this foreign thing so that design
00:14 - doesn't feel like something that is
00:16 - unapproachable except for the best of
00:18 - all the best designers
00:20 - really quick
00:22 - um my name is doji my parents are from
00:24 - ghana
00:25 - and that's why my name is the way it is
00:27 - the d z is a j i was born in oklahoma
00:31 - though which is kind of cool
00:33 - i am
00:35 - i work as a volunteer for an
00:37 - organization called the interaction
00:39 - design foundation
00:40 - and what they do is
00:42 - their goal is to really promote design
00:46 - education
00:47 - especially
00:48 - ux design and human computer interaction
00:52 - and i work as the local leader in the
00:54 - oklahoma area i'm just trying to gather
00:56 - people together regularly to talk about
00:58 - design topics and to really tell them
01:00 - it's not this
01:02 - thing that cannot be approached that
01:04 - everyone can actually do it and you just
01:06 - need to learn about the basics and you
01:08 - can slowly work your way up from there
01:10 - i use zurb foundation as
01:13 - a framework for doing web design and web
01:16 - pages i like it a lot so if i lean
01:19 - towards pushing zurb that's the reason
01:21 - why
01:22 - it isn't because it's the best it's just
01:23 - i like it that's about it find what you
01:26 - like use it
01:28 - and i'm also a teclahoma volunteer as
01:30 - well so from here on out i'll be helping
01:32 - with some other
01:34 - organizations here at
01:36 - teclahoma where we're going to be
01:37 - getting together and once again trying
01:39 - to bridge between tech
01:42 - the development and then the design part
01:44 - as well there'll be announcements about
01:46 - that later on so keep posted on the
01:48 - teclahoma website for that
01:51 - today what we're going to go through
01:53 - is first design and design thinking and
01:56 - this is really
01:58 - what you want to do
01:59 - to
02:00 - get into solving a problem so we're
02:03 - going to talk about what design is
02:05 - then i'm going to get you some tools and
02:07 - some basic knowledge so that you have
02:08 - something to base everything off of and
02:10 - you're not just in the wild like what's
02:12 - this design thing what's going on
02:15 - and then a workflow having a workflow
02:17 - makes it easier for you to go from start
02:19 - to finish i'll just show you one there
02:21 - are lots of them and as soon as you get
02:23 - comfortable you can adopt your own
02:25 - with no problems
02:27 - and we're going to do some small case
02:29 - studies they're not really case study
02:31 - level but i'm taking some elements live
02:33 - from the web and then i'm going to be
02:35 - using those
02:36 - and then finally some resources to get
02:38 - you started i have some books over here
02:40 - at the end of the talk you can look
02:42 - through those are my recommendations
02:43 - with books
02:44 - and i really think they can help get you
02:47 - on your way the slides will be online as
02:49 - well and any links that i have are on
02:51 - those slides so don't worry about those
02:53 - either
02:55 - so now let's go ahead and talk about
02:57 - design and design thinking these are the
02:59 - basics this is where we're starting from
03:01 - and
03:02 - what is design i would like to say i
03:04 - have the ultimate answer to that
03:06 - but i don't
03:07 - they're greater minds than me who still
03:10 - have difficulty talking about it so i'm
03:12 - just going to give you the basic basic
03:14 - it's
03:15 - solving problems for humans in a way
03:19 - that can be approached by humans that's
03:21 - basically it
03:23 - you design lots of different things
03:25 - design can mean lots of different things
03:27 - for example if i say this podium is well
03:30 - designed am i talking about the
03:31 - aesthetic does it look really good or am
03:34 - i talking about how it's really easy to
03:36 - stand behind is it a balance between the
03:38 - two
03:39 - and those are all things that you need
03:41 - to consider whenever you're going
03:42 - through design as well it's problem
03:45 - solving
03:46 - and problem solving is really difficult
03:49 - i wish that i were the strongest being
03:52 - in the world and i had a magical
03:53 - gauntlet that could solve all design
03:55 - problems because snap my fingers and
03:57 - everything's good but usually this is
04:00 - what it looks like that's what you got
04:02 - so
04:05 - thanos i got you
04:08 - um
04:09 - let's go ahead with some design thinking
04:11 - so this is the pattern for design
04:13 - thinking
04:14 - and basically what you're doing is it
04:16 - looks like a straight line you empathize
04:18 - with the user and what empathy and
04:20 - empathizing is is understanding the
04:23 - problems of the user from the user's
04:25 - perspective
04:26 - you really want to know what the user is
04:28 - dealing with what the issue is
04:31 - why they're dealing with something
04:33 - i've had
04:34 - up till now lots of problems with math
04:37 - i'm a full-time software developer and i
04:39 - do
04:40 - lots of things but math is one of those
04:41 - things that i still can't really break
04:43 - the barrier on
04:44 - my dad is amazing at math
04:46 - i don't know why i didn't get any of
04:47 - those genes
04:49 - oh well
04:50 - but when i talk to him about math and i
04:53 - say i'm having this issue can you teach
04:55 - me
04:56 - he says to me that's easy oh it's just
04:59 - this this this this and it's done
05:02 - and i'm like
05:04 - okay
05:05 - and
05:06 - we have this disconnect and i can't talk
05:08 - to him about math
05:09 - because he isn't able to empathize with
05:12 - me at my point in time with where i'm at
05:15 - right however
05:17 - there are other people who i've talked
05:19 - to about math who say oh yeah i remember
05:21 - i had difficulties with that and that's
05:23 - how i dealt with it for example i had
05:25 - difficulties with programming i'm like
05:27 - how come i can't make a equal to x and
05:30 - now it's not an issue but i remember
05:32 - that and i empathize with people who are
05:34 - in that situation
05:36 - so i understand the problem and i know
05:37 - how to talk about it when it comes to
05:39 - design you want to do the same thing you
05:42 - want to understand what the user is
05:43 - dealing with
05:44 - i don't like the page
05:46 - okay
05:46 - why don't they like the page
05:48 - the buttons are all over the place i
05:50 - understand what the issue is it's hard
05:52 - to navigate this page that's where the
05:54 - empathy comes in
05:55 - so we've empathize with the user we
05:57 - understand that the buttons all over the
05:59 - page
06:00 - that's why they're having difficulty so
06:01 - now we need to define the problem the
06:03 - problem is the buttons need to be
06:06 - centrally located
06:08 - so we go to our next step
06:10 - ideation where you go through and you
06:12 - find
06:13 - different ways to solve the problem
06:16 - and
06:17 - after you've done your ideation
06:19 - you say these are number of ways that i
06:21 - can solve my problem you make a
06:22 - prototype
06:23 - this is the thing this is how we're
06:25 - going to solve it
06:27 - you test it
06:29 - and then you're done yay we designed
06:30 - something we're good to go
06:32 - except it doesn't quite work that way
06:35 - maybe you get to testing
06:37 - and you realize at your testing stage
06:38 - that you didn't really understand what
06:40 - the problem was
06:42 - so you go back
06:43 - because you now empathize with the user
06:45 - you understand what was going on you go
06:48 - back and you say
06:50 - this is what the real problem is let's
06:51 - start all the steps again
06:53 - or maybe you're testing
06:55 - and you're like this this is good but i
06:58 - have a better idea of how to make things
07:00 - better or
07:03 - you made a prototype or like wait this
07:04 - prototype
07:06 - inspired me to do more things i have
07:08 - more ideas of how i can solve this
07:11 - and you can keep going that way
07:13 - basically
07:14 - it's not a linear process
07:16 - don't think of it as a linear process
07:18 - you can probably start in the middle you
07:19 - can start at ideation and then work your
07:21 - way backwards it's very organic so don't
07:24 - worry about that
07:26 - so now we understand design thinking now
07:28 - we're going to go to solving the problem
07:31 - i have concept cars up here
07:33 - and the cool thing about concept cars is
07:35 - a car can be pretty much anything
07:37 - they all solve our problem our problem
07:40 - number one problem
07:41 - is
07:43 - how did you get here
07:45 - most likely you had
07:47 - some form of transportation to get right
07:49 - here
07:51 - and the car solved that problem we could
07:53 - go back to horses
07:54 - you could totally get here that solved
07:56 - the problem for a little bit but the
07:57 - problem was we wanted to get there
07:58 - faster
08:00 - safer with less poop on the streets
08:03 - so
08:04 - we had invented the car
08:06 - and the cars have issues too
08:08 - no we don't have poop in the streets but
08:09 - we have stuff in the air now so there
08:11 - are electric cars so whenever you're
08:13 - solving your problems you have a lot of
08:15 - ways you can do it we have for example
08:20 - the concept car this one right over here
08:24 - and that's amazing concept cars are
08:25 - awesome because it's like
08:27 - i can do anything look at this this is
08:29 - the coolest car and i totally wouldn't
08:31 - want to ride in it because i totally
08:33 - look like a dweeb or something it's just
08:35 - crazy
08:37 - but
08:38 - it is a form of design it's saying how
08:40 - far can we push the boundaries when you
08:42 - look at web design you can say the same
08:44 - thing how far can i push the boundaries
08:46 - you're making a portfolio site for
08:47 - yourself you might want to push those
08:49 - boundaries they can show that i know the
08:51 - technology i know what's behind the
08:53 - design and i know how to push it
08:56 - so that's one way to solve a problem
08:58 - we also have over here
09:00 - the luxury car
09:02 - that is pretty cool
09:04 - it's precise it has all the features you
09:07 - need
09:08 - but it's also unattainable for most of
09:10 - us i drive a forward i'm probably never
09:12 - going to afford a bmw unfortunately so
09:16 - it's not quite attainable it's those
09:18 - services that
09:20 - companies pay 2 000 a month for
09:22 - subscriptions right they have a lot of
09:24 - different
09:25 - features they're really elegant that's
09:28 - also a way to solve a problem
09:30 - right
09:31 - finally we have
09:33 - the consumer model right over here it
09:36 - checks all the boxes i can get from a to
09:38 - b
09:38 - it's safe enough
09:40 - it has enough features for my day-to-day
09:42 - and it's approachable i can say okay i
09:45 - can buy one of these cars
09:47 - and that's how you want to look at your
09:49 - designs as well
09:50 - who's going to be approaching it
09:54 - speaking of which
09:56 - we really want to think about the user's
09:59 - context
10:01 - what context who is the user what are we
10:04 - trying to do and what is the context
10:06 - are they
10:08 - is this for work
10:10 - is this personal
10:11 - is it business is it casual that's
10:13 - something you want to think about
10:15 - are they on their mobile phones
10:18 - are they on their tablets
10:20 - or are they working on a desktop
10:22 - now it's very important to think about
10:25 - that because i have an example over here
10:27 - in the wild you might want to take a
10:29 - look at this
10:30 - i like to download sounds and mess with
10:33 - sounds so i use a program and i'm not
10:35 - calling this company out okay but it's
10:37 - just
10:38 - it works for this presentation i use
10:40 - something called splice and i can
10:42 - download my sounds and i'm like well i
10:44 - have an ipad i'm going to get the splice
10:46 - app for my ipad and
10:50 - a ipad's pretty big
10:52 - i hold it like this i want to be at my
10:53 - desk i want the extra screen real estate
10:55 - that's why i got one of these big things
10:56 - and
10:58 - this is what i get very cumbersome for
11:01 - me to use
11:02 - because it was designed to be used on an
11:04 - iphone so now i have to use my tablet
11:06 - like an iphone
11:09 - that it doesn't really work no so you
11:12 - want to think about context a lot
11:14 - that's very very very important
11:19 - next we will actually want to think
11:20 - about a approach to our content
11:24 - so
11:26 - you're going to be presenting content to
11:27 - the user in some shape or form
11:31 - there are lots of ways to do it i'm just
11:33 - going to show you some examples these
11:35 - are
11:36 - what i've distilled it down to but
11:38 - there's more they're hybrids
11:40 - and there are other applications as well
11:41 - but first we might have email
11:44 - you might make an email message i'm sure
11:46 - you've all gotten those marketing email
11:48 - messages in your inbox the responsive
11:50 - emails they're really well designed
11:52 - you can apply your web design and html
11:55 - skills there
11:58 - you can also go with the webpage
12:00 - we've all seen them this is google way
12:02 - back in the day before they went and did
12:04 - their design overhaul
12:06 - there's a dashboard where you're
12:08 - presenting metrics to lots of different
12:10 - people and they want to see everything
12:12 - on one screen
12:14 - in as concise as possible
12:18 - next we also have an app
12:21 - a full-blown app and these get really
12:23 - complicated but it is a way to present
12:25 - content
12:27 - so we've gone through we've looked at
12:29 - design
12:30 - we know what's going on with
12:33 - design how to start our problem how to
12:35 - solve it
12:36 - now i'm going to give you the basic
12:38 - tools and knowledge so that you know
12:39 - where to go from here because you can't
12:41 - build something without the tools you
12:43 - can't build a house without
12:45 - nails wood
12:47 - and a lot of other things now
12:49 - so here are the tools of the trade we
12:52 - need pen and paper i recommend graph
12:55 - paper and you might be wondering if
12:57 - we're doing digital design
12:59 - why are we doing everything on paper
13:01 - well the biggest reason we're doing
13:03 - things on paper is
13:04 - because that's the fastest way to get
13:07 - your ideas down
13:08 - analog is much faster for so much than
13:11 - digital is
13:12 - i love tech i have a ton of computers at
13:15 - home
13:16 - my wife has to deal with my girlfriend
13:19 - which are computers
13:22 - so
13:23 - i just i love tech
13:25 - and
13:27 - the analog way is just faster than
13:29 - dealing with tech a lot of the time so
13:32 - you want to get comfortable with pen and
13:34 - paper and sketching if you're not
13:36 - comfortable with sketching i do have a
13:37 - book that i recommend and i'll talk
13:39 - about that later
13:40 - you also want
13:42 - some mock-up and prototyping tools and
13:44 - the reason that you need these tools are
13:47 - after you have your sketches down you
13:48 - want to make them presentable to
13:50 - somebody else
13:51 - if you can't present them as an idea if
13:53 - you can't pitch them to somebody if you
13:55 - can't walk them through this is how i'm
13:57 - going to build up your website this is
13:58 - how i'm going to redo your app this is
14:00 - how we're going to run your marketing
14:01 - campaign
14:02 - then you can't communicate so this is a
14:05 - way to start communicating
14:06 - you want a few web browsers you want the
14:09 - default on your computer but you
14:10 - probably also want firefox and chrome
14:13 - because
14:14 - people
14:15 - access websites and web media different
14:18 - ways
14:18 - and a website on one computer might show
14:21 - up slightly different on another so you
14:23 - want to make sure you
14:24 - have a few to test with
14:26 - and finally you want a text editor
14:29 - and you want to find one that you love
14:31 - i like sublime text three i don't
14:34 - recommend it for everybody because
14:35 - there's an upfront cost of like seventy
14:37 - dollars it's really good there are
14:39 - others that are free
14:41 - as well like visual studio code
14:43 - atom those are great ones and they all
14:45 - support
14:47 - the industry very well you can do web
14:49 - development across all of them i
14:51 - recommend ones that are cross-platform
14:53 - you can use them on mac or windows
14:54 - because maybe you have a mac and you're
14:56 - working and you go to a company that
14:58 - only has windows well if it's
15:00 - cross-platform you can still use your
15:03 - tools
15:04 - so try and look for cross-platform
15:06 - solutions when possible
15:09 - now we have our tools to make our
15:11 - wireframes
15:12 - mock-ups and our prototypes like i said
15:15 - start lo-fi
15:17 - because drawing in analog is much faster
15:20 - and easier to change the cost of
15:21 - changing a drawing is
15:23 - a new piece of paper
15:25 - writing things down really quickly
15:27 - wi-fi hi-fi whenever you go a little bit
15:30 - higher it takes a little bit more time
15:31 - to go through that because
15:34 - you have to go through and
15:37 - manipulate your elements
15:39 - change how they are resize things and it
15:42 - just takes a little bit more time and
15:44 - then whenever you're dealing with a full
15:46 - blown prototype and somebody says can we
15:49 - shift this to the left 10 pixels that's
15:52 - when your world is over because changing
15:55 - it at that point in time is really
15:57 - expensive so try and get everything out
15:59 - in the drawing stage communicate lots of
16:02 - sticky notes
16:04 - there are ways to do this and some of
16:05 - the books that i have to actually go
16:07 - through the methodology for how to go
16:10 - through and
16:11 - do your lo-fi drawing up to your
16:13 - prototypes
16:15 - next
16:16 - if you're doing web design you have to
16:19 - know css and how to work with css
16:22 - selectors
16:23 - i had difficulties with this for a
16:25 - little bit but then i found a
16:27 - plugin for a text editor called emmett
16:30 - and what emmett does is it allows you to
16:33 - write html
16:35 - using css selectors
16:37 - and i have an example i'm going to go
16:39 - ahead and pop that up over here i just
16:42 - have some text and let's see if i can
16:44 - see where my cursor is
16:46 - and you can see right over here
16:48 - it says table dot information
16:52 - and the dot would be a class in my table
16:54 - and i have a table row and then table
16:57 - cells over here and i have times three
17:00 - down here
17:01 - and with met if you have it installed
17:04 - and it can be installed in any one of
17:05 - those editors i talked about before
17:07 - you are writing
17:09 - these css selectors and you hit the tab
17:11 - button
17:12 - and then you get
17:13 - html
17:15 - so it saves you in writing html
17:17 - it saves you in missing closed tags and
17:20 - it also teaches you css selectors at the
17:23 - same time because that's the way to use
17:25 - the tool so
17:26 - you're getting
17:28 - three birds with one stone instead of
17:29 - just two or even one which is pretty
17:32 - cool
17:34 - next
17:36 - we're going to go to the next slide
17:41 - design patterns
17:43 - so you might be thinking well design is
17:47 - amazing but i've never done it i don't
17:49 - know how to do it well there are these
17:50 - things called design patterns and it's
17:52 - common ways to address problems there
17:54 - are lots of components so you don't have
17:57 - to start from complete scratch
18:01 - basically going through with these for
18:03 - example this is a carousel that you're
18:05 - seeing up on the screen and they're just
18:06 - ways for you to organize content
18:09 - manage data input
18:11 - work with search boxes
18:13 - autocomplete drop down boxes etc those
18:15 - are all called design patterns and i
18:17 - have a list over here
18:19 - there's more as well and i have links to
18:21 - where you can see more about design
18:23 - patterns but it's just an easier way to
18:25 - approach it so you know oh if i'm going
18:27 - to make that webpage i need
18:29 - a tab navigation i'm going to need a few
18:32 - drop down boxes some text input and a
18:34 - search field and by doing that you
18:37 - simplify the design process because
18:38 - you're not doing everything from scratch
18:40 - from the beginning
18:42 - next
18:43 - you want to understand the basics of
18:45 - responsive design
18:47 - and
18:48 - with that example with splice
18:51 - that wasn't a responsive app
18:53 - it was made for cell phone and then they
18:55 - just stretched it so if i had a tablet
18:58 - that was this big
18:59 - i would have to hold it like this it's
19:01 - very cumbersome it just it doesn't make
19:03 - sense but with responsive design what
19:06 - you're doing is saying
19:08 - people are going to approach content
19:11 - from different devices in different ways
19:14 - i need to make sure that my content
19:16 - adapts to their device and i don't need
19:18 - to force them to adapt to my content
19:21 - this has been around for a while it's a
19:24 - very good approach to design for the web
19:26 - and for apps and software as well
19:30 - jumping into it straight off is
19:32 - difficult
19:33 - so i recommend that you jump into a
19:36 - front-end framework of some sort
19:39 - i recommend foundation i've used it it's
19:41 - really great they've been around for a
19:42 - long time
19:43 - it's very simple easy to read
19:46 - bootstrap is also very good
19:48 - bulma and skeleton are good as well
19:50 - and you might wonder like
19:52 - in the day and age that we have the css
19:54 - grid
19:55 - why would i need
19:57 - a front-end framework
19:59 - well it's a more approachable way to get
20:02 - your design up and running from the
20:03 - beginning
20:04 - and you don't have to fight with it as
20:06 - much and the css grid is really good
20:10 - if you're in a company that's working
20:11 - from scratch on a new system i would
20:13 - recommend using the css grid because the
20:15 - company owns all of that and you can
20:18 - tailor it to your needs however if
20:19 - you're making your own web page or
20:21 - you're working on a web page for
20:22 - somebody else and it's
20:23 - just needs to be up there and you want
20:25 - it to be responsive and you don't want
20:27 - to have to put in all the work of
20:30 - customizing all the different controls
20:33 - i most definitely recommend a front end
20:34 - framework
20:37 - next let's take a look at a workflow
20:40 - so we need to figure out how we're going
20:42 - to work through things to get from start
20:44 - to finish
20:46 - and this is usually how you go through
20:47 - it
20:48 - you do a rough pass
20:51 - you do a prototyping pass
20:53 - and then you do a finishing pass so your
20:56 - rough pass is
20:58 - basically doing all your sketches and
21:00 - these are some sketches i did they're
21:02 - not good they're just i sketched on
21:04 - paper i used the graph paper to help me
21:05 - draw straight lines otherwise i can't
21:07 - draw straight lines
21:09 - so that's why i recommend graph paper
21:11 - lots of notes
21:13 - arrows like this is where i want it to
21:14 - go this is if you click here this is
21:16 - where it goes to
21:17 - that's what you're thinking about
21:19 - whenever you're in the paper prototyping
21:21 - stage that's really what you want to do
21:24 - sketch a lot just keep sketching as soon
21:26 - as you're like i'm done sketching for
21:28 - today that's about when you should stop
21:30 - but keep sketching until you hit that
21:33 - after you've hit that point take a break
21:35 - take a breather go someplace
21:37 - listen to some music
21:39 - play some video games do something else
21:41 - whatever floats your boat come back with
21:43 - a fresh mind
21:44 - and then start
21:45 - transitioning your sketches
21:48 - over to using digital tools so like a
21:51 - mock-up tool balsamic mock-ups is really
21:53 - good
21:54 - it looks very
21:56 - 1990s but that's perfect because you
21:59 - don't want your mock-ups to be too hi-fi
22:02 - there's also adobe xd
22:04 - and i would recommend that for
22:06 - prototyping not as much for mockups
22:08 - because
22:08 - when you're in xd you start talking
22:10 - colors and fonts and everything and it's
22:12 - too early for that you really want to
22:14 - state lo-fi
22:16 - everything rough so that you have the
22:17 - freedom to change things around
22:21 - next we go into prototyping this is
22:23 - where you would jump into adobe xd and
22:26 - what are my colors and what do i do
22:28 - so you'd have a
22:29 - hi-fi
22:31 - a hi-fi sketch
22:33 - like i have over here i did that in
22:35 - balsamiq and i just click a button and
22:37 - it becomes hi-fi
22:39 - and then you might want to start looking
22:41 - at colors what am i going to do with
22:42 - colors
22:43 - you might make a mood board
22:46 - and a mood board can be a collection
22:48 - it's an eclectic collection of lots of
22:50 - things together that says this is the
22:51 - mood we're going for this is kind of
22:53 - what we want our finished product to
22:55 - look like feel like and be
22:58 - and
22:59 - at the beginning starting off and
23:01 - jumping into a mood board mood board can
23:03 - seem very daunting
23:05 - but there are easy ways to get there and
23:07 - i'm going to show you one first you can
23:09 - see that this one has five colors i have
23:12 - five color swatches
23:14 - and
23:15 - there's an easy way to get here
23:18 - we can go ahead and
23:20 - on this screen
23:23 - i have
23:25 - adobe color cc
23:27 - and what it does is it allows you to get
23:31 - colors from a picture or start with your
23:34 - own color palettes so you can go in and
23:37 - if i navigate over there
23:40 - make sure i'm there
23:41 - you can
23:42 - move these colors around
23:44 - and it's going to try and based on a
23:46 - color you choose
23:48 - it gives you complementary colors
23:50 - or other colors that might match
23:52 - now what i like to do
23:54 - is
23:55 - with your mood board
23:57 - you might be looking on the internet for
23:58 - pictures like i had in mind
24:00 - so you get a picture
24:02 - and
24:02 - you tell kohler that you're going to
24:04 - start from an image
24:06 - i have avengers images over here
24:08 - apparently i like the avengers
24:10 - let's go ahead and take a look at what
24:11 - happens if we toss tony stark iron man
24:13 - in here
24:15 - awesome
24:16 - and it goes through and it makes a color
24:18 - palette for us
24:20 - it's that easy
24:21 - and
24:22 - obviously as you go into doing more
24:24 - design they're going to be intricacies
24:26 - that you're going to have to deal with
24:28 - but starting out for just a five-tone
24:30 - color theme you can do something like
24:31 - this i got iron man over here these
24:33 - colors look
24:34 - pretty okay
24:35 - i might need to use white as the text
24:38 - color if i'm going to use black as the
24:39 - background and then the other colors as
24:41 - trim
24:42 - or buttons over there that works
24:44 - sometimes you might toss a picture in
24:46 - and it just doesn't work
24:48 - let's see what else we have i have
24:51 - spiderman from the
24:52 - 10th anniversary let's go ahead and
24:56 - yeah that really doesn't work it's
24:59 - no
25:00 - and it happens but you can go through
25:03 - and there are other ways to navigate
25:05 - around
25:06 - you can
25:08 - i might not be able to see it over here
25:11 - this is back to the wheel
25:13 - and that is back to my image let's try
25:15 - the hulk
25:20 - that's okay
25:22 - you could go ahead and choose styles and
25:24 - that changes it
25:25 - so you can change it like oh that's
25:27 - better i could probably work with that
25:28 - and do something with it
25:30 - so that's a good way to go ahead and
25:32 - start choosing your colors
25:37 - so back to prototyping we also want to
25:39 - talk about fonts just a little bit
25:43 - so you see i have some fonts that i just
25:44 - decided to mess with i'm like okay how
25:46 - can i match these fonts i have a really
25:49 - bold
25:50 - slab style font and then i have a sans
25:54 - sarah style font over here that i tossed
25:56 - in as well
25:59 - and
26:01 - we can work with that there are tools to
26:02 - work with that as well
26:04 - my goal is to get you the tools to start
26:06 - working with them instead of being
26:08 - afraid of them and one way you can do
26:09 - that is
26:11 - we can do a web search
26:14 - and
26:15 - this is a web page
26:17 - i just typed in font pairings
26:20 - 20 perfect font pairing so other people
26:22 - who are really really into typography
26:24 - went through and said if you pair these
26:26 - fonts depending on what you're doing you
26:28 - should be pretty okay
26:30 - and you can just scroll through and see
26:32 - some font pairings and say oh these are
26:34 - some fonts that i want to go through
26:36 - and it's good to know what a sans serif
26:38 - font is and what a serif font is
26:41 - at the beginning and as you go over time
26:43 - you'll get more in depth and
26:45 - understanding what's going on but
26:47 - yeah we'll scroll down
26:48 - and
26:49 - i think over here at number nine is what
26:51 - i wanted to use
26:53 - there's the liberation serif and sans
26:55 - serif and as you can see the serif font
26:58 - has little flares at the ends
27:00 - and the serif the sans-serif font is
27:03 - very flat and straight
27:05 - that's pretty much the difference
27:07 - and they said that you can pair these so
27:09 - we might want to use
27:11 - the serif font as a header and then the
27:14 - sensor for our body
27:17 - and one way you can do that is we're
27:19 - going to go on to
27:21 - google fonts
27:24 - and you can choose some fonts
27:28 - we i typed in lib ahead of time
27:31 - so
27:32 - they don't exactly have the fonts that
27:34 - were there but they have some things
27:35 - that are pretty close these two right
27:36 - over here
27:37 - they are fairly close let's go ahead and
27:40 - see if i can add them
27:43 - so you would add it like this
27:47 - and then it gives you
27:49 - the
27:50 - css and the link
27:52 - for actually tossing that into some
27:54 - place
27:55 - now there's one more tool on top of that
27:58 - that i would want to use
28:01 - after we've had our font selected and i
28:02 - have
28:03 - some other things going on on my screen
28:05 - right now so that i can show you what's
28:07 - going on
28:09 - there is a tool
28:12 - called
28:14 - grid lover and in grid lover you can
28:17 - experiment with fonts so it has the font
28:19 - here
28:21 - and you can use the little buttons up at
28:23 - the top
28:24 - to navigate
28:26 - between the different panels here's the
28:28 - link panel where you'd put your link
28:30 - text
28:31 - let me get my link text so that it will
28:34 - talk to the google
28:36 - font provider and you'll get those two
28:38 - fonts
28:40 - that we looked at over there
28:42 - so i can paste them in
28:46 - and i paste them in here
28:48 - that's awesome and i said that i would
28:51 - use one for the body and one for the
28:52 - header so
28:54 - for the body where you uh for the header
28:56 - we're using the serif font
28:58 - i have that over here
29:00 - and i've copied the code for that and
29:02 - i'm going to try and paste this in here
29:05 - there we go
29:06 - and paste that there
29:08 - we can see it changes
29:10 - so you can start working with fonts that
29:12 - way
29:13 - that's another header and we can just
29:15 - see how it works with our headers that's
29:17 - a little too big we might want to reduce
29:18 - that but just to show you for example so
29:21 - that is an example of what we did with
29:24 - these
29:25 - serif headers and then we can also toss
29:27 - in our
29:28 - sans-serif body as well to see how that
29:31 - changes things
29:32 - and i would encourage you to use this
29:34 - tool and experiment with it so that you
29:36 - can see what's going on with your
29:38 - designs so let's go with the body
29:41 - this is what we have over here and i'm
29:42 - going to change it with the code from
29:44 - google
29:45 - fonts and that's how it changes it so
29:47 - you can experiment this way you don't
29:48 - have to set up a web page you can just
29:49 - go to this webpage toss on font
29:51 - combinations see what you think and see
29:53 - how you like them
29:55 - very very handy
30:00 - awesome next
30:03 - we're going to go to polishing up your
30:05 - work
30:06 - so we've already talked about deciding
30:08 - on some fonts
30:10 - and thinking about font pairings and how
30:11 - to work with the fonts
30:13 - you also want to reduce image sizes
30:15 - you're working with somebody who has
30:17 - a cell phone they're downloading a
30:19 - webpage i'm sure we've all had it how
30:21 - many of you have had a web page that
30:22 - just takes forever to load on your phone
30:25 - everyone okay
30:27 - a lot of times what's happening is they
30:29 - gave you the desktop version of the
30:31 - image
30:32 - and your phone is trying to download all
30:34 - of that it wastes your
30:36 - bandwidth on your phone it takes up your
30:38 - packets or whatever you use per month
30:41 - and it's also slow so you want to find
30:44 - ways to reduce it it's called responsive
30:46 - images and
30:47 - there are lots of ways that you can deal
30:49 - with it i recommend you go and search
30:51 - for using responsive images and
30:52 - responsive designs to get started with
30:54 - that you also want to leverage an icon
30:56 - pack
30:57 - and the reason that you want to go with
30:58 - an icon pack is
31:00 - instead of going through and designing
31:02 - each and every one of these icons right
31:04 - here that takes a long time
31:06 - they're icon designers out there that
31:08 - that's all they do they make icons so
31:10 - that you can use them get one of those
31:13 - toss them in your design you can color
31:15 - them using css it's very handy and it
31:17 - saves you time so once again the whole
31:20 - design thing is you don't have to do
31:21 - everything with design you just need to
31:23 - know how to combobulate
31:25 - if that's a word discombobulates a word
31:28 - the different parts of design so that
31:30 - you can get what you want to work with
31:33 - okay let's go ahead and take a look at
31:34 - some case studies
31:36 - we have all the information that i've
31:38 - given you so far
31:39 - and i'm going to give you some more
31:41 - information
31:42 - whenever it comes to design like where
31:44 - do i put something how should i color it
31:47 - what do i want it to be
31:48 - how would the user perceive it there are
31:50 - lots of ways to find out
31:52 - how to analyze that one way is
31:56 - gestalt principles
31:58 - it's a really big word for principles of
32:01 - good figure or how to make something
32:03 - look good
32:05 - i've put four of them up here i think
32:07 - they're close to
32:08 - 15 thereabouts
32:10 - and sometimes they're called laws
32:13 - otherwise other times they're called
32:14 - principles really they're just good
32:16 - rules of thumb
32:17 - because there's always ways to break
32:19 - them
32:20 - but basically we have the law of
32:21 - proximity
32:23 - that means if things are close together
32:25 - they feel like a group two people are
32:28 - walking down the street and
32:30 - there's a huge gap between them you're
32:32 - like oh there are two people walking
32:34 - down the street
32:36 - there's a guy and a girl walking down
32:37 - the street in their shoulder to shoulder
32:38 - like oh okay maybe they're together or
32:41 - something law of proximity how close
32:43 - things are together
32:45 - the law of similarity
32:47 - things that look the same act the same
32:51 - and this works for buttons
32:53 - links
32:55 - anytime we see a web page we're like
32:57 - links are blue
32:59 - usually and when you hover over them
33:01 - that gives you the little hand icon
33:04 - and we've learned that so anytime we see
33:06 - something similar we're like i can click
33:07 - it clicky thing i can click it there's
33:10 - also figure ground distinction where
33:13 - the figure like me right now is what you
33:16 - want to focus on and the ground is
33:18 - what's behind this is what's behind me
33:21 - if i wanted to blend in so that you guys
33:23 - couldn't see me
33:24 - i would probably wear a suit that looks
33:26 - like this
33:27 - and then i'd stand back here and then
33:29 - you'd see a floating head but you
33:30 - wouldn't see the rest of me and that's
33:32 - how we can kind of talk about figure to
33:34 - ground distinction
33:36 - right you can see me really well because
33:37 - i'm wearing a black shirt against a
33:39 - white background
33:40 - there's also law of common region where
33:43 - things that are share the same border
33:46 - feel like a group so if they're in the
33:48 - same boundary the same border
33:50 - they feel like a group that's law of
33:52 - common region
33:54 - let's go ahead and take a look at these
33:55 - in the wild
33:58 - first one over here this is a
34:01 - an email that i got
34:02 - from century i use sentry for logging
34:05 - what's going on on my web servers it
34:06 - sends me messages about all the people
34:09 - from foreign countries trying to hack
34:11 - into my computer do bad stuff about it
34:13 - that's why there's the failed password
34:14 - invalid user
34:16 - thing over there
34:18 - and it sends it to me and you can see
34:20 - that we can see some of these laws so
34:22 - the law of proximity
34:24 - these info messages are close together
34:26 - they kind of seem like they are together
34:28 - we see the law of common region
34:31 - there's a line dividing this this area
34:33 - is for the logo
34:35 - this area is for the
34:37 - type of alert
34:39 - and down here is for just a few action
34:41 - buttons and because of that
34:42 - horizon line that's what we see
34:45 - we also see the law of similarity the
34:47 - blue things they look clicky so i think
34:49 - i can click on them
34:51 - which is awesome and you can click on
34:52 - those
34:54 - as well
34:55 - also it's a little bit hard to see on
34:58 - the projector but the background for
35:01 - this email is
35:03 - light gray on gray which is
35:06 - back over here and it's a subdued color
35:10 - which
35:11 - doesn't draw attention to itself
35:13 - and because the white is so s
35:16 - steady and stable you're drawn to the
35:18 - white so that's a way to group it
35:20 - there's also a border around the whole
35:22 - message saying this is the content
35:24 - the background is just the background
35:27 - here's another one we have a dashboard
35:30 - and
35:31 - we can see
35:33 - the laws that play over here
35:35 - we have the law of proximity all the
35:36 - metrics are close together
35:39 - the foreground is really bright the
35:41 - background is dark you're not you're not
35:43 - really drawn to the um background it's
35:46 - a bluish
35:48 - slate blue navy blue thereabouts
35:51 - and
35:52 - you're not really drawn to it because
35:53 - everything on the front is really bright
35:55 - it jumps out at you the bright blues
35:57 - you're seeing that the red when the
35:58 - numbers and the metrics
36:00 - cards
36:02 - cards are a design pattern and you're
36:04 - seeing cards over here cards
36:06 - really encompass the law of common
36:08 - region it's a region around
36:11 - what you're looking at that says this
36:12 - data together is all together that's a
36:15 - way to group it i want to group these
36:16 - things so that you see that this is a
36:18 - group this is how it works
36:21 - using cards as well is a really great
36:22 - way to get into responsive design
36:24 - because cards move around they're really
36:25 - easy to move around
36:27 - next let's take a look at a page
36:30 - so this is typekit kind of like google
36:33 - fonts
36:35 - and
36:36 - typekit over here
36:38 - we can see
36:39 - law of proximity they give you lots of
36:42 - generous space
36:43 - between the different elements
36:45 - and then the elements that are together
36:46 - they put them really close so they
36:48 - really exaggerate the extremes over
36:49 - there that's what they're doing that's
36:51 - what they're trying to do to go through
36:52 - that
36:54 - and
36:55 - the law of similarity well we have
36:57 - clicky things once again
36:58 - the green looks clicky
37:00 - the buttons you can click on them
37:02 - anything that's rounded square looks
37:04 - like an action button i can action it i
37:06 - can click on that and do something with
37:08 - that
37:09 - that's really cool
37:10 - and finally we have an app instagram
37:13 - the law of common uh the law of figure
37:15 - ground distinction is really prominent
37:18 - here because the picture jumps out at
37:20 - you and the rest of instagram is kind of
37:23 - not really there
37:25 - that's the point they want you to scroll
37:28 - they want you to see more pictures so
37:29 - the pictures vivid everything else
37:32 - yeah you can pass it over the action
37:35 - buttons are wireframe and once again
37:37 - they probably went with wireframe
37:38 - because they don't want to draw
37:39 - attention to it as much
37:42 - and that's one thing that you can do but
37:44 - they're wireframed but you can tell
37:46 - their action buttons because all of the
37:48 - actiony buttons are very similar
37:52 - so that's it i think
37:55 - i should talk about white space
37:58 - but instead i'm going to talk about
37:59 - japanese bento boxes
38:03 - i love japanese food i was in japan for
38:05 - a long time i was there eight years and
38:07 - you see bento boxes everywhere
38:10 - this is a bento box
38:12 - i love it it has my fish stuff where
38:15 - fish stuff should be it's separated from
38:17 - the sour sweet tasting stuff and my
38:20 - wasabi stuff because i don't want that
38:21 - on my rice
38:23 - and they're all separated we got the
38:24 - sushi stuff up here they're all separate
38:26 - compartments i know where everything
38:27 - goes it goes in this place they're
38:29 - awesome
38:31 - oh we got a super packed bento box over
38:34 - here we got separators in there that's a
38:37 - separator
38:38 - sushi stuff
38:39 - fish stuff they're all separated the
38:42 - juices from the different types of food
38:43 - aren't going to flow into each other so
38:44 - when i eat my shrimp it tastes like
38:46 - shrimp it doesn't taste like pickles i
38:48 - don't like pickles
38:51 - pretty good stuff
38:53 - there's another bento box
38:55 - four squares
38:57 - very geometric and you got your food
38:59 - stuff and your rice stuff and then over
39:02 - here we got stuff in stuff and stuff
39:05 - man you can really put regions around
39:07 - these things and finally high class
39:10 - bento box
39:12 - i got containers for your containers for
39:13 - your containers for your containers
39:15 - you've seen web pages like this they're
39:18 - doing it to help separate things put
39:20 - things in boundaries
39:22 - i guess what i'm saying is if you take a
39:25 - look at design
39:27 - web design well done web design you
39:29 - might see some bento boxes this morning
39:31 - i was fortunate to make a bento box for
39:33 - my wife
39:34 - this is it i took a picture i'm like i'm
39:36 - tossing that on my slide this morning
39:38 - that's it got the rice stuff and the
39:40 - cheesy stuff and the cold stuff to the
39:42 - side and then you pack that up and you
39:44 - got your avengers again
39:46 - there we go awesome
39:48 - so if you go ahead and take a look at
39:49 - design
39:51 - bam that's a bento box
39:53 - i should have changed the colors
39:55 - that's terrible design you could scold
39:57 - me
39:58 - red on black
40:00 - on a projector that is terrible on the
40:02 - computer you can see it over here you
40:04 - can't but yeah you see that that's a
40:06 - bento box we got another bento box over
40:09 - here we got the red and the things and
40:11 - the things
40:12 - and we got ourselves another bento box
40:15 - and yet one more bento box they're all
40:17 - bento boxes
40:19 - good design good spacing good white
40:21 - space
40:22 - bento boxes awesome
40:26 - so now let's go ahead and i'm going to
40:28 - give you some resources and some ideas
40:30 - for you to go ahead and start moving
40:32 - forward
40:34 - first if you have a chance i think you
40:37 - should go through and look through some
40:38 - grid systems
40:40 - grid systems are really good especially
40:42 - if you're going to be working with the
40:43 - css grid directly you need to understand
40:46 - grid systems and how they work if you're
40:48 - working with a front-end framework
40:51 - not so much you can just start going but
40:53 - eventually you're going to
40:54 - travel to grid systems so take a look at
40:56 - that
40:57 - there are lots of different ones
41:00 - you want to browse through a design
41:01 - system
41:03 - if you want to go to sleep at night
41:05 - you're having trouble sleeping actually
41:06 - look through a design system
41:09 - i know i'm not that's not good pr for
41:11 - design systems but they're like 300 page
41:15 - documents of how you should make your
41:16 - application fit the standards of apple
41:19 - or microsoft or google
41:21 - they have
41:22 - tidbits and gems in there
41:24 - go through take a look skim find the
41:27 - gems the rest you can leave it unless
41:29 - you actually have to conform to all of
41:31 - the standards for that platform also
41:34 - take a look at dark themed trends right
41:36 - now
41:37 - we're seeing a lot of dark themes all
41:39 - over the place because people don't want
41:40 - to get their retinas burnt out looking
41:43 - at white screens all the time
41:45 - for today's talk i used a bright screen
41:48 - on my text editor but usually it's
41:50 - really dark
41:51 - you come into where i work it's really
41:53 - dark
41:54 - my co-workers are like you're so dark
41:56 - like i'm a black man i'm dark
41:58 - i got a black shirt on dark i wear black
42:01 - so dark threatened
42:02 - and then we have jennifer dewalt
42:05 - 180 page pages in 180 days project you
42:10 - should check her project out she spent
42:13 - one day making a webpage each day
42:16 - getting progressively more difficult it
42:18 - is awesome
42:19 - and she made lots of mistakes
42:22 - she left them out in the wild in the
42:24 - open for you to see
42:26 - it's a very good attitude to have to say
42:29 - i'm going to try something and even if i
42:30 - fail i don't care if other people see it
42:33 - she got 180 pages and you could see her
42:35 - skill increasing as she went on she
42:37 - started with this is text on a page to
42:40 - this is how you upload an image to my
42:41 - webpage
42:42 - people did bad stuff with the images so
42:44 - be careful
42:46 - uh then it went from that to this is a
42:49 - random text generator to lots of things
42:52 - and she just kept going please check out
42:54 - her project it's on github and you can
42:56 - also see her blog and her webpage
42:59 - finally some books
43:02 - these are some of the books i recommend
43:04 - steve krugs don't make me think
43:06 - is a great way to get into
43:09 - usability
43:11 - ux design
43:13 - user research
43:15 - and just the whole process that i talked
43:17 - about here
43:19 - if you're looking at learning how to
43:21 - sketch i'm not going to say learning how
43:23 - to draw because as soon as you say draw
43:25 - you start thinking
43:26 - amazing art and
43:28 - we don't need to go that far you just
43:30 - need to have have enough to get it done
43:32 - this shows you how to get it done it
43:34 - gives you some exercises and practice
43:36 - that you can do every day to
43:38 - improve your sketching look at stick
43:40 - figures a different way she made some
43:42 - awesome stick figures in it i have these
43:44 - books here by the way so that after the
43:46 - talk you can come see me look through
43:48 - them if it's something you're interested
43:49 - you can go online and get the books
43:52 - next is design for hackers
43:54 - if you're really into programming or
43:56 - like i'm a programmer programmer and i'm
43:58 - not going to do design because i don't
44:00 - understand design it doesn't make sense
44:02 - you can go through read this book have
44:04 - some good information for you
44:06 - it goes into depth on a lot of the
44:07 - things that i've already talked about
44:09 - but in ways
44:10 - that make sense to people who came from
44:13 - a programming perspective
44:15 - and then finally thinking with type
44:17 - this is a dead book if you're like i
44:20 - want to know everything about typography
44:22 - this is where to start
44:24 - if you want to read a book
44:26 - cover to cover and then find good
44:27 - references about how to use typography
44:29 - this is a good book
44:31 - it is really dense though
44:33 - just a word of warning
44:36 - we also have some online resources
44:39 - a lot of the talk came from these
44:41 - resources that you can get at the
44:42 - interaction design foundation
44:45 - the design process they go into depth on
44:47 - that the glossary of human computer
44:49 - interaction
44:50 - that's a glossary of things that you
44:52 - need to know when talking with other
44:55 - industry professionals about how to talk
44:57 - about
44:58 - how users interact with your pages
45:03 - they also have the link to the gestalt
45:04 - principles that i talked about
45:06 - next travesty
45:08 - travesty media
45:10 - and they have a video on emmett how to
45:13 - use emmet as a way to start learning css
45:16 - and how to speed up writing html
45:19 - and finally
45:21 - the zurb foundation grid you can go and
45:23 - check out that video it shows you how to
45:24 - use a front-end framework bootstrap you
45:28 - just do a search for bootstrap you can
45:29 - find bootstrap up there as well
45:31 - and you'd be good to go
45:34 - that's it
45:36 - i'm going to open it up for any
45:37 - questions if anybody has any
45:40 - yes
45:50 - okay so the question was a good place to
45:53 - go to find information about how to
45:55 - design for usability
45:57 - using your product and how to make
45:58 - things usable for users for example
46:01 - people who might have problems seeing
46:03 - with like colorblind
46:05 - green red green
46:07 - issues
46:11 - hearing impairments where you'd be using
46:13 - the aria tags in your html a good place
46:16 - to start would probably be the
46:19 - nelson
46:20 - norman
46:21 - website
46:22 - by don norman he wrote a book called the
46:25 - design of everyday things
46:27 - it is a really good book he talked about
46:29 - his struggles with
46:30 - everything he went to europe and things
46:32 - were backwards and kept on running into
46:34 - doors he tried to open doors that
46:36 - wouldn't work and his group does
46:38 - research on usability
46:40 - he also helps with the interaction
46:42 - design foundation because that's all
46:44 - what they do so i would go to nissan
46:46 - norman first
46:47 - because don norman did a lot of work
46:49 - there and then you can start going
46:51 - out from there
46:55 - good question
46:56 - anyone have anything else
47:00 - and there are a bunch of resources i
47:02 - don't have them here on my computer
47:03 - right now but if afterwards you give me
47:06 - your information i can send them your
47:07 - direction as well
47:09 - because there are checkers that can
47:11 - check to make sure that the contrast on
47:12 - your web pages is enough that you can
47:14 - see them so that you don't run into that
47:16 - mistake that i had on the
47:18 - projector with red on black
47:20 - it's good to make mistakes because you
47:21 - can teach people
47:26 - anything else
47:28 - okay well thank you very much
47:32 - [Applause]
