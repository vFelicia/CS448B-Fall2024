00:41 - you need to learn and you can watch them
00:44 - right here on our Channel for free so
00:46 - let's start by defining what backend
00:48 - development is a backend developer is a
00:50 - type of programmer who focuses on
00:52 - creating the underlying logic and serers
00:54 - side software that powers websites and
00:58 - applications their primary resp
00:59 - responsibilities include serers side
01:01 - logic they write the code that runs on
01:04 - web servers which handles the business
01:06 - logic of an application this includes
01:08 - processing user requests interacting
01:10 - with databases and controlling the flow
01:12 - of data between the server and the front
01:14 - end of the website or application
01:17 - database management backend developers
01:19 - are often responsible for Designing
01:21 - implementing and maintaining databases
01:24 - they manage and manipulate the data
01:26 - that's stored in these databases
01:27 - ensuring its integrity and security API
01:30 - development they often create
01:32 - application programming interfaces or
01:34 - apis which allow different software
01:36 - applications to communicate with each
01:37 - other these apis are crucial for the
01:40 - integration of different systems and for
01:42 - enabling front-end applications to
01:44 - access serers side functions and data
01:46 - server management they may also be
01:48 - involved in configuring and managing the
01:50 - servers where the applications run this
01:52 - can include setting up cloud-based
01:54 - servers managing server resources and
01:57 - securing uptime and performance sec
01:59 - security ensuring the security of the
02:02 - web application is a key part of a
