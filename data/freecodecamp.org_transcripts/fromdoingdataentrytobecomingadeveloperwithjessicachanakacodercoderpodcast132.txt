00:00 - the first one to two years were
00:02 - incredibly stressful because I
00:04 - constantly felt like I was going to fail
00:08 - and they were going to fire me for
00:10 - incompetence so it was a lot of Googling
00:13 - it was a lot of like looking up at deack
00:15 - overflow trying to do as much research
00:18 - on my own before I actually asked one of
00:21 - the other developers because I was also
00:23 - very afraid of annoying the other
00:25 - developers if I bug them too much with
00:27 - questions so it was like
00:30 - I would say it was pretty difficult for
00:32 - me at that time but I was learning so
00:34 - much like I think my brain was just like
00:36 - expanding with the amount of things I
00:38 - would learn
00:50 - [Music]
01:11 - welcome back to the free Cod Camp
01:13 - podcast I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and
01:15 - founder of freecodecamp.org each week
01:18 - we're bringing you Insight from
01:19 - developers Founders and ambitious people
01:22 - getting into Tech this week we're joined
01:24 - by Jessica Chand AKA coder coder she's a
01:29 - soft software engineer who has worked in
01:31 - the field for more than a decade and
01:33 - interestingly she studied Photography in
01:35 - school and she never even took a
01:37 - programming class uh and yet she's had
01:40 - this illustrious career so we're going
01:42 - to learn a lot from her welcome Jessica
01:45 - yeah thanks so much for having me yeah I
01:48 - uh I've been a longtime admirer of your
01:51 - work uh of the caliber of your husband's
01:54 - animation sound design like all the
01:56 - production you put into these amazing uh
01:59 - video courses that you create and just
02:01 - your fun sense of humor and like it's
02:04 - just like if there was like a word to
02:06 - describe Cod or quer I would describe it
02:08 - as
02:09 - like fun I mean that may seem kind of
02:11 - like a like a short word to describe it
02:13 - but it is fun to watch your videos
02:16 - that's awesome yeah thank you that is
02:18 - definitely one one thing we we aim for
02:20 - with the the videos yeah so I want to
02:23 - like go way back as we always do and
02:25 - just start with like kind of how you got
02:27 - into Tech because my understanding is
02:29 - you don't have any formal training en
02:31 - coding and in fact like your career kind
02:35 - of like evaporated early on as the field
02:38 - just fundamentally changed and uh you
02:40 - you found yourself like working kind of
02:42 - like in those kind of temp office type
02:44 - jobs and stuff uh for quite a while like
02:47 - but before we get to that like maybe you
02:49 - can talk a little bit about your early
02:50 - days and your early
02:53 - Ambitions yeah so as you said I didn't
02:56 - you know go to school for anything
02:58 - programming wise but I was always into
03:01 - computers even from a pretty young age
03:04 - um like I remember going to the library
03:06 - and checking out like a book on basic
03:08 - programming and trying to like do that
03:10 - on the computer at home um and then also
03:13 - in I think it was middle school or High
03:15 - School my sister and I ran a BBS this is
03:19 - pre internet days a bullet and board
03:20 - system so that was and that was
03:23 - something that I kind of set up myself
03:25 - um and yeah that was super fun um back
03:30 - in the back in those days yeah how do
03:32 - bbs's work I mean I know because I used
03:34 - to use them but but like what is running
03:38 - it a BBS like uh of course that's like a
03:40 - major plot point in the show Halt and
03:42 - Catch Fire like uh they set up a BBS in
03:45 - the 80s but maybe maybe you could talk
03:47 - about what that was like cuz yeah how
03:51 - did you get special software did you
03:53 - have like a special
03:54 - server um we ran it off of one of the
03:57 - computers that we had at home so we had
03:59 - two computers at home so one of them you
04:01 - would have to run the software to run
04:03 - the BBS and people would actually have
04:05 - to physically call your the phone number
04:08 - attached to the computer in order to
04:11 - connect to the BBS from their computer
04:14 - um with these different protocols and
04:16 - everything was sort of asy art you know
04:20 - very slow slow speeds like 2400 bod
04:23 - modems and all that kind of stuff um but
04:27 - yeah you could log into the BBS you
04:29 - could there were message boards there
04:31 - were games you could play they were
04:33 - actually really fun you could also
04:34 - upload and download files so yeah it was
04:37 - just a way for people to find community
04:40 - and just like you know have fun in their
04:41 - spare time yeah and what kind of
04:45 - software did you have on that because I
04:46 - remember like when I dial into a BBS
04:48 - there would be like places you could
04:49 - like leave messages for other people
04:51 - kind of like a like an altnet uh uset
04:54 - like precursor uh but there were also
04:57 - lots of interactive games where you
04:58 - could only do so much every day so it
05:00 - like encouraged you to come back the
05:01 - next day and like bu buff up the stats
05:04 - of your character and like explore it
05:06 - was like kind of like text based
05:07 - Adventure type stuff yeah for sure um I
05:11 - ran it off of a software called Renegade
05:14 - so you could you didn't have to code it
05:16 - from scratch so you could download these
05:18 - BBS software packages I guess and then
05:21 - install them on your computer and so you
05:24 - didn't have to do any actual programming
05:25 - to really set it up you just had to kind
05:27 - of install it and configure it um so
05:31 - yeah no programming needed what do
05:33 - people use it
05:35 - for I used it to play games they were
05:37 - really fun um there was like legend of
05:40 - the red dragon the sort of D and D
05:42 - themed game where you you know fought
05:44 - monsters and try to get gold um there's
05:48 - also kind of a Star Wars themed game
05:49 - called trade Wars where you would trade
05:52 - different um resources and you could
05:55 - like save up to get like the
05:57 - Enterprise type uh ship and they like
06:01 - fangi and stuff yeah it was it was fun
06:04 - fun times that's pretty cool so it's
06:06 - basically like kind of like a Commerce
06:07 - simulator where you you have like uh
06:10 - yeah that sounds fun and how many people
06:13 - could use the BBS concurrently like did
06:15 - you have multiple phone lines um it was
06:18 - limited to one person per phone line and
06:20 - we only had one phone
06:21 - line
06:23 - so yeah how did how did uh your parents
06:26 - feel about like having that phone line
06:28 - tied up all the time we yeah we're
06:30 - pretty I would I guess privileged
06:32 - because my parents were willing to pay
06:34 - for a second phone line that was
06:36 - dedicated to the
06:38 - BBS um but yeah I limited to one person
06:40 - at a time which is kind of mind-blowing
06:44 - you know considering nowadays everything
06:45 - is like happening at the same time yeah
06:48 - maybe you could talk about like how you
06:49 - get the word out as a kid like did you
06:51 - just tell your friends at school or like
06:53 - how did people discover that there was
06:54 - this phone number they could dial into
06:56 - with their modem and play games and
06:58 - stuff I think there were places you
07:00 - could list your BBS but my sister and I
07:02 - were members of other local bbs's and
07:06 - had made friends and stuff so you just
07:08 - kind of tell your friends about your own
07:10 - BBS and because ours was smaller it was
07:13 - you were less likely to get a busy
07:15 - signal when you tried to call in which I
07:17 - think the friends really liked so it was
07:19 - kind of like a just like a hangout place
07:23 - um for like us and our online friends
07:25 - yeah I mean that's so cool because it's
07:27 - like very local I mean it yeah I don't
07:30 - know if there's like a an equivalent on
07:31 - the internet right now because
07:33 - everything is concurrent like just
07:35 - because I'm looking at somebody's
07:36 - Instagram feed doesn't mean somebody
07:38 - else can't also look at it right or any
07:40 - sort of synchronous like chat type
07:42 - experience like using slack or using uh
07:45 - Discord or something like that like
07:47 - everything you just take for granted
07:48 - that it's like a multi-tenant operation
07:51 - right um yeah so yeah I can imagine all
07:54 - the constraints in terms and and also
07:55 - the fact that it's like dealing with
07:57 - extremely low amounts of data so
07:59 - everything text ask text yeah that's so
08:02 - cool like it was a different world how
08:05 - did you even discover like how did it
08:08 - like pop in your mind because I would
08:09 - use other people's bbs's but it never
08:11 - occurred to me like I should create a
08:12 - BBS on my own like what do you remember
08:15 - like was there like some uh moment of
08:17 - Revelation like I could do
08:19 - this I think looking back I think I've
08:22 - always had this interest in building
08:26 - things
08:27 - so before I became web developer I
08:30 - taught myself HTML and basic CSS in high
08:33 - school like this is back in the geoc C's
08:35 - days and I just would kind of make blogs
08:39 - for myself but it wasn't because I had
08:41 - all these things I wanted to say it's
08:42 - because I just enjoyed setting up the
08:45 - the blog websites and I remember my
08:46 - friend was like sort of making fun of me
08:49 - a little bit because I kept just like
08:50 - having new blogs and I would have to
08:52 - send her like the new link every time um
08:54 - but it didn't really sort of cement in
08:57 - my understanding that like I enjoyed
08:59 - making making you know blogs after blogs
09:01 - cuz I enjoyed building websites um but
09:04 - yeah I think I just always liked making
09:06 - things and Building
09:08 - Things yeah well um maybe you can talk a
09:12 - little bit about like your early days
09:14 - and and you know what your aspirations
09:16 - were around High School
09:19 - age um I think in high school I was
09:22 - probably I was a very goody two shoes
09:25 - and I think I wanted to be a doctor um
09:28 - cuz my dad he's tired now but he was a
09:30 - doctor um so I think that was kind of
09:34 - the the limits of my aspirations for
09:37 - some reason I didn't realize that like
09:39 - you could be a web developer or a
09:41 - programmer back then I'm not sure why
09:44 - but I just I didn't really think about
09:46 - you know what job out of all the jobs in
09:48 - the world can I do I think I just sort
09:50 - of had a very limited sort mind mindset
09:52 - at that point yeah and I think that's
09:55 - that's a common thing uh among like a
09:57 - lot of people that come on the fre
09:59 - cocaine podcast is like they have like
10:01 - this mentality like oh I'll be like a
10:03 - doctor or a lawyer or a dentist or or
10:05 - some kind of other type of engineer like
10:07 - because that's what the people you know
10:10 - that are older than me seem to be doing
10:11 - in these Social Circles and they seem to
10:13 - be doing well they've got like the house
10:15 - and they they've got you know stable
10:17 - income and they they're eventually going
10:18 - to be able to retire and stuff like that
10:20 - so so you kind of look at those people
10:21 - and you're like wow if I just had a lot
10:23 - of money and I could basically just do
10:25 - whatever I want and like have like a
10:27 - really good you know sound system or
10:28 - whatever it was you know we aspired to
10:30 - when we were kids you you kind of like
10:33 - look at the job as just something you do
10:35 - as a means to an end to just have a
10:37 - relaxing enjoyable life and and be able
10:39 - to have a family and stuff like that
10:40 - like that's how a lot of people I think
10:44 - look at uh when they're younger they're
10:46 - just like okay what do I do that like
10:48 - being a doctor you get tons of respect
10:50 - right uh like people call you
10:54 - doctor right and and like if if if
10:57 - somebody like has like a collapses on
10:59 - the sidewalk or something they're like
11:00 - is there a doctor and you run over and
11:01 - everybody parts to make way for you so I
11:04 - can definitely understand why like I
11:05 - would definitely say that's the most
11:07 - common thing that people who come on the
11:08 - free C Camp podcast want to be when they
11:10 - grow up as a doctor uh but for you that
11:13 - that wasn't in the cards and it probably
11:15 - wasn't for academic reasons but like why
11:18 - did you ultimately not decide to
11:21 - pursue yeah um yeah I think the the
11:26 - doctor thing didn't last very long um so
11:29 - College I took I think intro to
11:32 - chemistry and I almost failed it and I
11:34 - think after that class I was like I
11:36 - don't think this is for me because I
11:37 - knew the classes would only get harder
11:38 - and harder with like organic chemistry
11:40 - and like all this kind of stuff so I
11:43 - dropped that and then I didn't know what
11:45 - to major in and I eventually took a
11:48 - drawing class and I loved it and this
11:51 - art is something that I had done you
11:54 - know since high school I took a lot of
11:56 - Art and photography classes in high
11:58 - school and I just you know really
12:00 - enjoyed that so I thought oh maybe I'll
12:04 - try majoring in art so that's kind of
12:06 - how I got into majoring in photography
12:09 - in school that's so interesting like I I
12:12 - just assume because you're like frankly
12:13 - you're like a really smart person like I
12:16 - definitely look at you and say she's
12:17 - probably like way smarter than me um and
12:20 - the reason I think that uh you know like
12:24 - if you look at like the caliber of your
12:26 - work and the way you carry yourself and
12:28 - talk and and stuff like this person is
12:29 - extremely organized and so I just
12:32 - presumed oh it's probably not an
12:33 - academic reason do you ever wonder if
12:35 - like that was like a weer class or some
12:37 - sort of like like that if you could have
12:39 - actually probably like powered through
12:42 - uh doing like Premed and then medical
12:44 - school and stuff like that or do you
12:45 - genuinely think it wasn't you didn't
12:46 - have it in
12:47 - you I think I could have I think the the
12:50 - problem this is I think this is just my
12:53 - personal
12:54 - situation I like didn't have a really
12:57 - big social life in high school I didn't
12:59 - really have that many friends that I
13:00 - would hang out with so the only thing I
13:02 - had to do was study and read books so
13:04 - that's basically all I did when I was
13:06 - younger then I went to college and you
13:08 - know college is like this new experience
13:10 - you meet all these new people so I had a
13:12 - lot of friends and so I in high school I
13:15 - didn't have to really have time
13:17 - management skills where I'm choosing to
13:19 - study over doing something fun but in
13:21 - college I ended up doing a lot of fun
13:24 - things as opposed to studying so I would
13:26 - like routinely hang out with people and
13:28 - then I would have to stay up till like
13:30 - 3:00 a.m. studying and trying to finish
13:32 - my work um or I would just stay up till
13:35 - 3:00 a.m. cuz I was hanging out with
13:36 - people so like yeah I did not have great
13:40 - time management skills like at all um
13:43 - when I was in college which is sad to
13:45 - say but that's kind of what happened so
13:47 - I think that's that's the reason why it
13:49 - didn't really work out but I I don't
13:51 - think I would have enjoyed all the
13:53 - different science classes to be
13:55 - honest yeah yeah so you're into art um
14:00 - so to to resolve that tangent you're
14:01 - into art and uh you're interested uh
14:04 - like like where does this drawing class
14:07 - take you in terms of like what's your
14:08 - progression as a creative thinker and
14:11 - and
14:13 - maker um yeah so I think the drawing
14:16 - class the the
14:18 - professor actually was like asking me
14:21 - she she was a painter who was doing like
14:23 - a temporary thing at my school and she
14:26 - was like I why are you not majoring in
14:29 - art so I think I just took that as a big
14:31 - compliment which you know was and that's
14:33 - kind of how I decided to you know major
14:37 - in that um but in terms of artistic uh
14:42 - skills or whatever I think that I
14:45 - actually didn't learn very much
14:47 - photography at all because my professor
14:49 - was very hands-off so he would just say
14:51 - all right go take pictures and then we
14:52 - would take pictures and develop them and
14:53 - print them and then we would like hang
14:55 - them up and have critiques and that was
14:57 - it he didn't really like teach us very
14:59 - much so I actually taught
15:01 - myself more after college um cuz I lived
15:05 - in Boston for a long time and I was
15:08 - unemployed for about a month after I
15:09 - moved there so all I did was walk around
15:11 - the city and with my little Sony point
15:14 - and shoot camera and I just like shot
15:16 - photos all around the city for you know
15:19 - that became one of my hobbies and I
15:21 - think that kind of practice over and
15:24 - over helped me to really develop better
15:27 - photographic skills
15:29 - so I'm yeah I feel like you can teach
15:33 - yourself a lot just through trying
15:35 - things yeah 100% I I can I can get
15:39 - behind that sentiment because that's how
15:41 - I like kind of root Force learning
15:42 - coding and other things like that and it
15:44 - sounds like so one interesting note
15:46 - about what you're there was actually a
15:48 - study like and I'm always like really
15:52 - load the quote like social science
15:54 - studies because they can't necessarily
15:55 - be uh reproduced the finings can't be
15:58 - reproduced NE early but uh I think there
16:01 - was like they B it was photography and
16:05 - and they they had like some Professor
16:06 - who basically said like told some of the
16:08 - students like I want you to just take
16:10 - one picture but I want it to be a really
16:12 - good one and the other one just go take
16:13 - a ton of pictures and it turned out that
16:15 - the people that just incidentally took a
16:17 - whole lot of pictures like they were
16:19 - practicing and their their photos were
16:21 - better subjectively how how do you judge
16:23 - a better photo but like yeah the the the
16:26 - researchers found that like the the
16:28 - students or the professors like like
16:30 - that I'm sorry I'm totally butchering
16:31 - the findings but the point of the study
16:33 - was that like it you know you can stand
16:36 - all day there and talk about the theory
16:38 - what what you know makes for a good
16:40 - composition of a shot what's like the
16:42 - hierarchy and like all these other
16:43 - different considerations right I know
16:44 - nothing about photography uh
16:46 - but but at the same time like if you
16:49 - just go out and practice the actual
16:50 - skill maybe a lot of this you'll into it
16:52 - and you'll build it up so maybe your
16:53 - professor was kind of like the the
16:55 - equivalent of like those old uh you know
16:57 - um the master from the Kung Fu movies
17:00 - like standing there pass you know you
17:05 - know basically just just giving you like
17:08 - very vinary feedback on your work but it
17:10 - does sound like you some critique right
17:13 - um but but like maybe he had kind of
17:16 - internalized that like to become a good
17:19 - photographer you just got to go out and
17:20 - take a lot of photos right a lot of a
17:22 - lot of shots on goal so to speak um yeah
17:25 - that's cool so you you were living in
17:27 - Boston so this is after college we can
17:29 - we can go to Life After College right
17:33 - like for a photography major um which I
17:39 - mean I I think if you took like all the
17:40 - different college majors and you rank
17:41 - them like you know Premed and like
17:43 - software engineering and things like
17:44 - that like computer science I think is
17:46 - like the highest compensating degree you
17:47 - can study overall like over like the
17:49 - next 20 years like something like that
17:51 - but
17:53 - like if you were to stack rank those
17:56 - like I'm pretty sure photography would
17:58 - be toward the bottom in terms of like
18:01 - remunerative careers I apologize if you
18:03 - can hear like some lawnmowing stuff this
18:05 - is just like that one day of the month
18:07 - can you is that coming through to you at
18:08 - all I cannot hear it so I think you're
18:11 - good yeah well it dodged I don't have to
18:14 - go out and like politely asked the
18:16 - gentleman to like come back later okay
18:20 - so um yeah so I guess my point is like
18:24 - no no shade at all the photography
18:25 - Majors like I uh you know I'm an English
18:27 - major so that's also toward the bottom
18:29 - of the list but like when you arrive at
18:31 - Boston what are you thinking like why
18:33 - did you move to Boston first of all cuz
18:35 - that's like a big expensive city and
18:37 - like you said you were unemployed for a
18:39 - month like did you have a job lined up
18:41 - or what what were your what was your
18:42 - thinking at this point in your life I I
18:45 - went I was like kind of already in the
18:47 - New England area and some of my friends
18:49 - had moved to Boston already so it seemed
18:52 - like the next logical step to just kind
18:54 - of move to the nearest big city um but
18:56 - yeah I looking back I can't I almost
18:59 - can't believe I did this but I just was
19:01 - like okay I'll just move there I'll find
19:02 - a job once I'm there um and the only
19:06 - thought I had was I'm going to try to be
19:07 - an artist because that was the only like
19:11 - I guess job that they really talked
19:14 - about at school they didn't really train
19:16 - us
19:17 - to yeah think about other jobs like you
19:21 - know I don't know going into advertising
19:22 - or other things like that being a
19:24 - commercial photographer like everything
19:26 - was about about the fine art stuff
19:29 - so anyway in Boston I was just looking
19:32 - for jobs related to photography and so I
19:35 - just called up all the Photo Labs in the
19:37 - area and one of them like ended up
19:39 - giving me a job so that's kind of how I
19:41 - fell into I worked in a commercial photo
19:44 - lab and yeah that was a that was a fun
19:48 - experience but I did not make much money
19:49 - at all so when you say like a photo lab
19:52 - like where you going to get your photos
19:53 - developed like with the chemicals and
19:55 - stuff yep yeah so they they serviced
19:59 - commercial um photographers so it was a
20:03 - really large lab the professional
20:05 - photographers would come in with all
20:07 - their roles of film from their shoots
20:08 - and we would develop them we had a film
20:10 - guy who just all he did all day was
20:12 - develop all the film um and my job was
20:15 - to make contact sheets from the strips
20:17 - of film where you can see it's like the
20:20 - size of the negatives but you can see
20:21 - what's on them um before
20:23 - printing um so that was one of my jobs
20:26 - but yeah that was a it was a really fun
20:28 - experience but but definitely not
20:30 - doesn't exist as much anymore today yeah
20:33 - yeah I mean with the EV a digital
20:35 - photography that like kind of like
20:37 - probably made that industry go the way
20:39 - of like buggy whips like there are still
20:42 - some people that sell buggy whips like
20:44 - there there are like multi hundredy old
20:46 - companies that produce these buggy whips
20:48 - and it could be that like 100 years from
20:50 - now there are still Photo Labs but
20:52 - they're going to be probably very Niche
20:55 - yes and yeah it's not like a giant
20:57 - industry anymore right uh like I
20:59 - wouldn't be surprised if that that
21:00 - industry had undergone like a 90% you
21:03 - know reduction over the past 20 years
21:05 - for sure if not more so okay so you're
21:08 - working in this photo lab uh servicing
21:10 - uh professional uh you know
21:12 - photographers probably like wedding
21:13 - photographers the people that do like
21:15 - yearbook I don't know like who who are
21:18 - the commercial what are what are the
21:19 - jobs in photography how did how did the
21:21 - photography industry work at the time um
21:24 - from what I could tell just from the
21:25 - people coming in they were like um
21:27 - commercial portrait photographers they
21:29 - do you know newspaper and magazine
21:31 - photos there were wedding photographers
21:34 - um and there also some just like fine
21:36 - artists who would come in um and they
21:38 - would have us print their their photos
21:41 - for them um so it was it was kind of a
21:43 - range I'm sure there were some like
21:45 - hobbyist photographers who were just
21:47 - kind of doing it for fun too yeah did
21:50 - did you have any ankling like hey I
21:51 - could do what they're doing and like go
21:53 - out and like make kind of like a
21:55 - consultancy out of this or like be a
21:57 - freelance photographer
21:59 - I don't know why well I sort of tried I
22:01 - did sort of second shooting for some
22:04 - wedding photographers and I interned
22:06 - with one of the commercial photographers
22:07 - who came in but for some reason it never
22:10 - really stuck with me in terms of oh this
22:12 - is something I want to
22:13 - do um it just seemed like I think I just
22:17 - didn't know how to even break into the
22:19 - field and I didn't have enough of a
22:22 - maybe desire to be a photographer to do
22:26 - the research to figure out how to do the
22:27 - business side of things things
22:30 - so yeah yeah I mean this is kind of
22:33 - like sorry I didn't mean to interrupt
22:35 - you there's a little bit of legy uh yeah
22:38 - this is like an indictment of higher
22:40 - education that you studied photography
22:43 - for like four years and you still have
22:45 - like no idea how to actually like go out
22:46 - and make money as a photographer and and
22:49 - you're not even sure that you would want
22:51 - to even if you knew how but you know
22:54 - college just kind of put you onto this
22:56 - track and they give you a major
22:58 - important major and then there's so much
23:00 - momentum behind it and it's so hard to
23:02 - switch but I mean it does sound to me
23:04 - kind of
23:05 - like
23:07 - uh if I can like be probably over
23:10 - prescriptive in hand wavy but it sounds
23:11 - like you know uh you said you didn't
23:15 - have a a big interesting social life uh
23:18 - when you were younger you go to college
23:20 - college is where a lot of people if
23:21 - you're fortunate enough to go to college
23:23 - like their social life kind of burgeons
23:24 - and the whole world opens up right it's
23:27 - not just like High School never ends
23:29 - type uh you know clicky things it's like
23:31 - real people kind of like becoming
23:34 - friends and and around common interests
23:36 - and stuff like that and a lot of that
23:37 - kind of like high school nonsense kind
23:39 - of like breaks down to an extent like
23:42 - once you get out of like fraternity
23:43 - sority spheres and stuff uh and I'm not
23:46 - trying to like knock those or anything
23:48 - but like I was never in a fraternity and
23:49 - like I didn't have a lot of respect for
23:51 - like the fraternities and stuff like we
23:53 - we always kind of looked a SCS at them
23:55 - if that's how you pronounce the word
23:57 - like oh you know like that's like we're
23:58 - here to learn you know like like I kind
24:01 - of like elevated myself above like the
24:03 - people doing like you know drinking
24:05 - excessively and stuff like that so um
24:08 - but it sounds like you had kind of like
24:10 - a social Awakening in college and then
24:13 - uh maybe the fact that that that was all
24:16 - happening distracted you from academics
24:18 - to an extent and when the professor was
24:21 - like oh you should consider being an
24:22 - artist or wanting to switch to Art
24:24 - you're like sure it doesn't sound like
24:26 - there was like a ton of Liberation and
24:29 - like long-term planning during those
24:32 - four years would you agree with that
24:33 - sentiment I I don't want to
24:34 - mischaracterize it no I would definitely
24:36 - agree I think I just didn't know what
24:38 - was possible so you don't know what you
24:40 - don't know and I didn't really
24:43 - understand how I needed to think about
24:45 - trying to find a
24:47 - career or you know choosing you know
24:50 - which one I wanted to do um so I think
24:53 - it was yeah a lot of fumbling and just
24:56 - not really knowing what what I wanted in
24:59 - life I think back
25:00 - then but you're in Boston this very
25:03 - expensive city uh very you know
25:05 - prestigious City like that's where like
25:08 - Harvard is MIT there's so many uh like
25:11 - big important companies based out of
25:13 - Boston there's so much research being
25:15 - done there it's it's like a really
25:17 - important and it's one of the oldest
25:18 - cities in the United States so it's got
25:20 - like this very long stored history and
25:23 - um and you're just kind of working at a
25:26 - photo lab and like
25:29 - did you feel like ambition going to and
25:32 - from work every day like at what point
25:34 - did the more ambitious Jessica Chan
25:36 - start to materialize the one that we all
25:38 - know and respect
25:40 - today I think it took a while I think I
25:43 - I really just didn't know what I wanted
25:46 - to do when I was in my 20s so I think it
25:49 - wasn't really until I started working um
25:54 - at this small web dev shop in Boston
25:58 - that I was thinking oh I can like sort
26:00 - of stay here and learn how to program
26:03 - they were doing like sort of backend
26:05 - like database work that's kind of where
26:07 - I started um how did you get how did you
26:09 - get that
26:11 - job um so as you probably saw in my like
26:14 - YouTube video I did a lot of temp office
26:17 - jobs for I would say a few years so this
26:20 - is just you know like it was fine work
26:22 - but um it wasn't something that I
26:25 - necessarily felt passionate about but I
26:28 - was looking for a job at one point cuz
26:30 - my like temp work had ended or whatever
26:33 - and I looked on Craigslist for just
26:36 - random jobs and I was like oh I could
26:38 - probably do data entry because that was
26:39 - one of the things that I'd done at my
26:41 - temp jobs so I found this data entry
26:43 - position in Boston and it ended up being
26:46 - at this small web dev shop and I got the
26:50 - job there started out doing data entry
26:52 - but then they ended up teaching me like
26:54 - SQL database work and doing net um
26:58 - programming and Microsoft Access for
27:01 - those of you who remember um so yeah
27:04 - there was that was kind of like
27:07 - my entrance into like the world of web
27:10 - development even though I had taught
27:11 - myself how to build websites when I was
27:13 - younger it was always just something I
27:15 - did for fun and it just never clicked in
27:17 - my brain that this is something that
27:19 - people can get a job in and also make
27:22 - like really good money so for some
27:25 - reason it just took me falling into that
27:27 - job and
27:28 - realizing like oh I have these like
27:30 - skills that I can develop and then use
27:33 - to apply for you know actual web
27:36 - development jobs cuz the job that I got
27:38 - from Craigslist was like very contract
27:40 - like temporary stuff yeah yeah it's
27:44 - almost like Destiny's way of like you
27:47 - know repeatedly like shoving you in this
27:49 - direction yeah um so so you're starting
27:53 - to learn the skills how do you go about
27:55 - learning this giant Corpus of knowledge
27:57 - it sounds like you already knew a little
27:59 - bit about you know Microsoft access
28:01 - database tool that comes with Microsoft
28:03 - Office like the PowerPoint everybody
28:05 - knows how to use PowerPoint everybody
28:06 - knows how to use Excel and Word but not
28:09 - as many people know how to use access
28:11 - because yeah the learning curve is a
28:13 - little bit steeper um but it sounds like
28:15 - you were you were learning relevant Tech
28:17 - skills just on the job and you were
28:20 - being pushed in this more technical
28:21 - Direction like do you remember a clear
28:24 - point where somebody entrusted you with
28:26 - actually building something do you
28:28 - remember what your first project
28:30 - was I mean I started out and I think
28:32 - this is what I think people realize when
28:35 - you get your first job in programming or
28:37 - web development or whatever is that
28:39 - you're not necessarily going to be
28:40 - tasked with building this entire giant
28:42 - project from scratch most likely you're
28:44 - going to be given tasks to do in
28:47 - existing projects that the company
28:48 - already has had running so that's what I
28:50 - did so I had to work on this website and
28:55 - I had to for example you know add or
28:57 - subtract um drop down menu items so I
29:00 - had to learn how to do that so it's very
29:02 - like task by task based or I had to
29:05 - learn how to um make changes to the
29:08 - websites that they needed with CSS or um
29:12 - just like learning how to run reports
29:14 - and write reports and SQL to get you
29:18 - know data from one of their clients so
29:20 - it was very much like I need to do this
29:22 - thing because my boss told me to if I
29:24 - don't know how to do it I need to figure
29:26 - it out
29:30 - yeah so uh essentially you had the
29:33 - benefit of having somebody tell you what
29:35 - to do and give you these missions and
29:37 - then each mission was like a growth
29:38 - opportunity uh and and how did you
29:41 - figure stuff out like because again you
29:44 - have no formal programming training you
29:46 - are a hobbyist like web designer I guess
29:49 - um and you have very rudimentary skills
29:51 - probably but you do have the benefit of
29:53 - kind of like a sense of Aesthetics you
29:55 - have like an eye from photography and
29:57 - from taking art class and stuff like
29:58 - that uh maybe you could talk about like
30:01 - the like your Ascent as far as like
30:04 - gaining more confidence uh in your
30:07 - abilities as you ran these kind of like
30:09 - fetch Quests for your for your
30:12 - boss yeah I think like looking back I
30:14 - honestly really lucked out with that job
30:17 - um it paid pretty terribly and also like
30:20 - I wasn't paid for eight hours a day I
30:22 - was only paid for like the actual tasks
30:24 - that they could build to their clients
30:26 - so depending on how busy they were it I
30:28 - might only have like 30 minutes or like
30:30 - a couple hours a day but what I did
30:34 - learn was how to learn or how to find
30:36 - solutions to things um because my boss
30:40 - would explain one time how to do
30:43 - something like how to you know run a
30:45 - squl query and how to write it and then
30:48 - I would have to do the same thing for a
30:50 - similar task and he got very grumpy if I
30:54 - had to ask him how if I had to ask him
30:56 - to explain something to me more than
30:58 - once so he actually would give me um and
31:03 - I think there were a couple other people
31:04 - working there at the time we all had
31:06 - notebooks that we had to leave at the
31:08 - office and we had to take notes um so if
31:11 - he would explain something I would write
31:13 - it down how to do it and then if I had
31:16 - to do the same task in the future I
31:17 - could just refer back to my notebook and
31:19 - be like oh this is how to do it and then
31:21 - if you do that five or 10 times
31:23 - eventually you learn how to do it
31:25 - without having to refer to your notes so
31:28 - that process times you know a hundred or
31:31 - however many times I just learned
31:34 - everything kind of Peace
31:36 - Meal which was one way to learn I think
31:39 - it worked out for me um because you
31:41 - learn real skills applicable skills like
31:45 - right away um you know I didn't learn
31:47 - things from a class and then have to
31:49 - figure out how that works in the real
31:51 - world later on so it was it was an
31:54 - interesting way to learn I'm not sure
31:58 - if that way exists as much anymore
32:00 - because this is back before coding boot
32:03 - camps existed so in some ways timing
32:06 - wise I really was fortunate in in terms
32:09 - of being able to find this job and also
32:12 - use my skills to land another Junior Dev
32:15 - job um a couple years later so I think
32:18 - the world has just changed a lot from
32:20 - that um but you know that's how it was
32:24 - for
32:26 - me I mean what you describe doesn't
32:29 - sound unlike what like a blacksmith
32:31 - might do to like an apprentice thousands
32:33 - of years ago right or maybe hundreds of
32:35 - years ago uh where it's like I already
32:38 - showed you how to do this like almost
32:39 - kind of like a cartoon like if you ever
32:41 - seen the old Sam Remy Spider-Man movies
32:43 - The Cigar chomping boss with like the
32:45 - the buzz cut and he's sitting back in
32:47 - his he's like Parker I told you to do
32:49 - this this and this you know kind of like
32:51 - very um I guess uh he has very high
32:54 - standards for you and what you're going
32:56 - to get done right um very much trial by
32:58 - fire yeah and that Trial By Fire Man the
33:02 - the lawnmowing is really intensifying
33:04 - again I apologize uh if anybody hears
33:07 - like you know what sounds like a
33:08 - helicopter
33:09 - landing it's very faint okay good good
33:12 - good good uh thank you for reassuring me
33:14 - that uh as I'm very openly say like at
33:18 - free camp we don't do anything of these
33:20 - podcasts like this is unfiltered like
33:24 - unfolding in real time right uh and for
33:26 - me that's like exciting it's exciting
33:29 - that there are a bunch of men with
33:31 - hoodies and leaf blowers outside my
33:33 - window like playing a part in this
33:35 - recording so uh yeah it sounds like you
33:39 - learned a ton from that opportunity even
33:42 - though it was probably like um it was
33:45 - like a certain window of time when it
33:48 - was like the Wild West in programming
33:49 - and technology and there weren't there
33:52 - wasn't really the expectation maybe that
33:53 - somebody would have formally studied
33:55 - programming and computer science or they
33:57 - if they studied that they probably
33:58 - studied a bunch of Applied Mathematics
34:00 - they didn't study how to build websites
34:02 - and how to do do and a lot of this these
34:05 - Technologies were kind of being invented
34:07 - on the fly during that era um so you
34:10 - don't necessarily have comprehensive
34:12 - textbooks maybe you go to like a a
34:14 - Barnes & Noble or a borders and you get
34:16 - like did you ever get like the big fat
34:18 - books like um on different Technologies
34:21 - like yeah yeah like um I have quite a
34:24 - few that I actually need to donate
34:26 - because I don't read them
34:28 - yeah well um I mean do you remember that
34:31 - era like uh of just going into a big
34:34 - bookstore and just be like wow like so
34:37 - much knowledge all this knowledge is
34:38 - right here yeah I need to buy this book
34:41 - and then there was like a CD ROM in the
34:43 - back oh yeah of course yep in the
34:45 - classic sleeve yeah very cool well so it
34:50 - sounds like you learned a tremendous
34:52 - amount there and I I'm excited to learn
34:53 - a little bit more about what transpar
34:55 - because it sounds like you you were kind
34:56 - of going through the the proverbial uh
34:59 - learning process but you were doing it
35:00 - in a way that most people don't do it
35:02 - because most people uh nowadays in 2024
35:05 - like just use freeo Camp to learn or
35:08 - they use some combination of courses
35:10 - like the courses you've developed uh or
35:13 - or you know video based courses or um
35:16 - they may use some books uh still to
35:19 - learn different Technologies like
35:20 - everybody learns a little bit different
35:22 - but to actually be in a shop with other
35:25 - devs kind of like almost kind of like I
35:27 - think of it as like um I mean I keep
35:30 - coming back to like a newsroom feel cuz
35:32 - it does feel like an editor just sending
35:34 - you out like giving you assignments and
35:36 - I worked in newspapers for a while and
35:38 - that was very much what it was like it
35:39 - was extremely hands off and you just
35:41 - like learned from your peers you learned
35:42 - from reading the New York Times every
35:44 - day and seeing what they were doing like
35:46 - like were you going to like Coca-Cola's
35:49 - website and like looking at their like
35:50 - interaction design and stuff like that
35:51 - and trying to learn from it or were you
35:53 - studying a lot of work that was out in
35:56 - you know in the wild
35:58 - to be honest I didn't because I was so
36:01 - overwhelmed with the work I had to do
36:04 - for my job during the day um and this is
36:07 - this is more like after I left that sort
36:09 - of temp job and was able to work at an
36:10 - advertising agency like that was like
36:13 - drinking from a fire hose in terms of I
36:16 - just had to like change this button on
36:17 - this landing page but like I knew that I
36:19 - had to get it done like in less than a
36:22 - day or a few hours because you know I
36:24 - need to meet my deadline so like it was
36:28 - I would say that the first
36:30 - three years the first one to two years
36:33 - were incredibly stressful because I
36:37 - constantly felt like I was going to fail
36:40 - and they were going to fire me for
36:42 - incompetence so it was a lot of Googling
36:45 - it was a lot of like looking up at stack
36:47 - Overflow trying to do as much research
36:50 - on my own before I actually asked one of
36:53 - the other developers because I was also
36:55 - very afraid of annoying the other
36:57 - Developers is if I bug them too much
36:58 - with questions so it was like I would
37:02 - say it was pretty difficult for me at
37:04 - that time but I was learning so much
37:07 - like I think my brain was just like
37:08 - expanding with the amount of things I
37:10 - would learn because like every day I
37:12 - would have to learn you know five five
37:14 - new things and then you multiply that by
37:17 - all the days in the year and like by the
37:19 - end of the first year I learned like so
37:21 - much just from having to do all these
37:24 - like innumerable little tasks yeah
37:28 - it was so yeah I didn't have free time
37:30 - to um try to build my skills because I
37:33 - was learning so much like on the job
37:35 - yeah interesting so like I mean would
37:37 - you just go home and be like exhausted
37:39 - like collapse in your bed like cuz
37:41 - learning is so hard and it's so tax like
37:44 - I spent a lot of my time learning and
37:46 - and not to make it about me again but
37:48 - like like there are days at the end of
37:52 - the day my brain is so tired I it's like
37:54 - mush because I spent the entire day like
37:56 - studying really hard on different topics
37:58 - and stuff like for me like the greatest
38:00 - feeling in the world the thing that I
38:01 - optimize and I build my life around
38:02 - obviously like rearing my kids and stuff
38:04 - like that and you know making a living
38:06 - and and you know running free camp but
38:08 - like in my free time I spend as much
38:10 - time as possible reading listening the
38:12 - podcast studying uh World languages of
38:14 - course shedding on the Bas woodshedding
38:17 - uh Charlie Parker famously goes to a
38:18 - Woodshed and just gets better by just
38:20 - practicing every day in the Woodshed and
38:22 - like like putting on records and
38:23 - learning from anyway sorry like go music
38:26 - tangent I'm obsessed with
38:28 - but
38:29 - um it sounds like your brain was kind of
38:32 - like expanding and you were probably I
38:34 - imagine again I don't want to talk too
38:35 - much about what was theoretically going
38:38 - on in your parid but I imagine like
38:40 - there were more wrinkles getting like
38:42 - you know formed in there and you were
38:44 - like did did you feel yourself becoming
38:46 - more powerful and more uh capable with
38:49 - every day was there a sense of full
38:52 - momentum I I think the first year was
38:55 - more just like living in complete compl
38:57 - abject fear of losing my job um so I
39:01 - think it it took I would say two years I
39:04 - think by the end of my second year at
39:05 - the agency I was like okay I think I'm
39:08 - like starting to feel less panic and
39:10 - more like I realize I'm still at the
39:12 - early stage of the learning curve but it
39:14 - doesn't feel as difficult and impossible
39:18 - as it did in the first year so it's a
39:21 - long time but like I think the 2-year
39:23 - Mark was really where I was starting to
39:25 - feel a little bit more comfortable with
39:28 - and even if I didn't know an answer
39:30 - right away I knew that I had the tools
39:33 - to look up and figure out the solution
39:35 - and I think that when I hit that point I
39:38 - was like okay I like subjectively like
39:41 - or objectively I can do pretty much
39:43 - anything that someone asks me I just
39:46 - need to have enough time to like do the
39:48 - research and do trial and error so it
39:50 - was like up to that point it was very
39:52 - hard but after that point I knew I was
39:54 - still a beginner but I felt more
39:56 - confident in my own ability
39:58 - to research and gain you know the the
40:00 - knowledge I needed to you know do my job
40:04 - so one of the takeways I'm getting is
40:06 - like as much as you were learning a and
40:09 - gaining competency like it was not a fun
40:12 - experience cuz it it sounds like like uh
40:15 - imposter
40:17 - syndrome the clinical diagnosis that
40:19 - every developer gets when they're
40:21 - learning the code unless they learn the
40:22 - code when they're a little kid and they
40:23 - completely forget you know like all the
40:25 - the trial and error and stuff um um it
40:28 - sounds like that was completely casting
40:31 - a shadow over like all the enjoyment
40:34 - like so this was a rough year of your
40:36 - life it sounds like it was rough yeah
40:38 - and I think personally I also don't like
40:41 - feeling incompetent so I think that also
40:43 - made it even more difficult for me to
40:46 - not just be fearful and stressed the
40:49 - entire time so you know maybe other
40:52 - people if you're more comfortable you
40:54 - know not being not knowing everything
40:57 - then maybe it would be a little easier
40:59 - for you but I I think I just put a lot
41:00 - of pressure on myself and I think that
41:02 - definitely contributed to how hard that
41:05 - first year was um yeah I was I was very
41:09 - grumpy yeah I I mean like I guess that
41:13 - was like my one thing like Saving Grace
41:15 - when I was like trying to learn to code
41:17 - over this very lengthy process like
41:19 - looking like a total amateure on stage
41:22 - at these hackathons presenting you know
41:23 - having my code crash and or or just like
41:26 - there was this one time that I went out
41:27 - to a hackathon and like I couldn't
41:30 - actually get the project to work like
41:32 - the whole team was counting on me and we
41:33 - just showed a slideshow instead of
41:35 - showing a working prototype and that was
41:36 - like probably like the lowest point in
41:38 - my coding Journey just having let down
41:40 - my team uh but the one thing that like I
41:43 - think made it a little bit more bearable
41:45 - is I've always been kind of
41:47 - like I've never like thought I was a
41:49 - particularly smart or interesting or
41:52 - capable person I always kind of looked
41:53 - at myself as kind of like
41:55 - a uh just
41:57 - just not like a serious human being um
42:01 - and you know like Socrates like the the
42:03 - only thing I know is that I know nothing
42:06 - and I I always kind of like like you
42:08 - know Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure
42:10 - like the fact that they're like these
42:11 - happy go-lucky kind of fools uh just
42:14 - stumbling into like these very important
42:16 - matters and stuff like that like I
42:17 - always kind of like looked at myself
42:19 - that way and that cushioned kind of the
42:20 - impostor syndrome I'm like of course I'm
42:22 - an imposter like I'm not that smart of a
42:25 - guy you know so uh it sounds like you
42:29 - were holding yourself to a higher
42:30 - standard than I was and that might have
42:31 - been part of the reason for the misery
42:35 - yeah uh you did power through it right
42:39 - you stayed at this job for like seven
42:41 - years right at the at the agency M
42:43 - that's a long time to be at a first job
42:46 - but it's commendable cuz cuz like you
42:48 - know the saying like a rolling stone
42:50 - gathers no Moss you were gathering tons
42:52 - of moss just chilling there right and
42:54 - you want to get moss you want to get
42:56 - character very Moss right you want to be
42:57 - an organic you know uh because Rock by
43:00 - itself is not organic right maybe some
43:03 - types of rock are like sedimentary I
43:04 - don't know but um you know like you were
43:08 - building out like this character and
43:09 - this this Persona as a developer and and
43:11 - kind of coming into your own can you
43:12 - talk about those other six years at the
43:15 - agency once you'd kind of gotten through
43:17 - the first yeah kind of Hell
43:19 - year yeah so I would say so I think I
43:23 - also got
43:25 - promoted um twice
43:27 - in my time there and obviously like
43:30 - companies are completely relative you
43:32 - know everyone sort of has a different
43:34 - idea of like what senior means and all
43:35 - that stuff but I started out as um an
43:39 - assistant web developer so junior level
43:42 - and then I think after two years I got
43:44 - promoted to just web developer so like
43:46 - in the middle and then I think year four
43:49 - I got promoted to senior web developer
43:52 - um again this doesn't mean I could be a
43:54 - senior at like Google or Facebook or
43:56 - whatever but
43:58 - I think that sort of I was it shows that
44:00 - I was able to progress in my career and
44:02 - the agency felt like I was you know
44:05 - contributing more and more the longer
44:07 - that I was there um so yeah it
44:10 - definitely got easier um over time and I
44:13 - felt more confident and less stressed
44:15 - and I sort of like I had a lot of fun
44:17 - back in my agency days cuz you know we
44:19 - all were it's like working together on
44:22 - these incredibly tight timelines and St
44:26 - staying up late sometimes and stuff like
44:27 - that and I don't know if I would want to
44:29 - do that again and have to stay up till
44:32 - 3:00 a.m. deploying something to
44:34 - production because a client needs it
44:35 - live exactly at that moment in time but
44:38 - it was a fun time and I did feel like um
44:42 - because I was more confident in my
44:45 - skills I was Al also able to take on
44:48 - bigger sort of scopes of work so in the
44:51 - last I would say few years of my time at
44:54 - the agency instead of doing these sort
44:56 - of peac meal tasks like updating this
44:58 - button or you know whatever building
45:00 - this like One landing page I would take
45:02 - on sort of full website builds like from
45:05 - scratch so for example one of our
45:07 - clients was a bank and so I built their
45:11 - website both back and front end um so I
45:14 - built the I set up the CMS we used craft
45:17 - CMS which is a a c CMS and then I also
45:21 - did the front end so I did I worked from
45:23 - the design from the designer and I did
45:25 - all the CSS and all that so that was
45:28 - very satisfying to be able to reach that
45:31 - point where I could actually build a
45:33 - project from start to finish like
45:35 - completely on my own so I I enjoyed that
45:37 - work a
45:38 - lot yeah that's that's sounds like quite
45:42 - an evolution so very beginning you don't
45:45 - know how to do anything you're like
45:46 - struggling to like referencing your
45:48 - notebook over and over that your boss is
45:50 - giving you you're scared to ask
45:52 - questions probably because he's created
45:53 - a Culture of Fear around asking
45:56 - questions
45:57 - but uh yep but by the end you're you're
46:00 - you're like this kind of superhero
46:02 - that's just like sure I can do I can
46:04 - learn you know CP craft new CMS I never
46:07 - heard of uh CMS uh I can do the front
46:10 - end and I I'm like Soup To Nuts uh full
46:14 - stack Dev basically that's that's got to
46:17 - be still have a notebook I do have to
46:18 - say I I still I didn't have a physical
46:21 - notebook as much but it was more like I
46:23 - would keep track of notes like online
46:26 - that's actually how the blogging thing
46:28 - started cuzz I started a blog spot just
46:30 - to write down the notes so I could
46:34 - quickly um refer back to them based on
46:36 - the the tags and stuff so that's kind of
46:39 - how I started the developer blog thing
46:43 - notes for myself man that that is a
46:44 - blast from the past so uh I know right
46:47 - there was this Blogspot and blogger were
46:50 - they were the same right they were the
46:52 - same yeah the domain was blog spot but
46:54 - it was called blogger great
46:57 - branding yeah it's very not confuse
47:00 - anybody right so if you read this book
47:03 - uh it's called the founders at work
47:05 - great classic book that every startup
47:06 - founder has to written by Jessica
47:09 - Livingston uh YC you know board member
47:12 - why combinator board member there's this
47:14 - amazing interview with EV Williams uh
47:17 - where he was running blogger and he had
47:19 - to fire everybody they ran out of money
47:20 - at one point because he was such a bad
47:22 - you know developer like CEO I I no shade
47:26 - to him but he's not the greatest CEO on
47:28 - earth right as we've seen time and time
47:30 - again right so uh then he went on to
47:32 - found Twitter and medium and all these
47:33 - other uh websites but um yeah man like
47:37 - that is a harrowing tale that's by far
47:39 - the best interview in the book is the
47:41 - the tale of kind of ineptitude that led
47:44 - the vlogger almost being destroyed until
47:46 - Google swooped it and saved it the 11th
47:48 - hour but uh that's a that's a cool
47:51 - website so you started blogging on there
47:53 - just as a way to track your own learning
47:55 - like I just take and email them to
47:57 - myself and then I search them in Google
47:59 - right like they're personal but you were
48:01 - actually publicly you were learning in
48:02 - public as Sha Wang likes to say like you
48:04 - were learning in public before it was
48:06 - the thing to do uh you were kind of like
48:08 - one of the early adopters of just yeting
48:12 - your learnings out into the stratosphere
48:15 - yeah I mean I wasn't trying to build an
48:17 - audience or whatever this is kind of
48:19 - before everyone was trying to do that it
48:20 - was really just I wasn't expecting
48:22 - anyone to find my blog and I don't think
48:24 - anyone public ever really discovered it
48:27 - cuz like it was just these random notes
48:30 - on like SQL and c and CSS and stuff yeah
48:33 - but it got the uh kind of like technical
48:35 - writing creative Creator engine going
48:39 - right like the the Jessica Chan the
48:41 - coder coder that we know today is
48:43 - ultimately a consequence of you sharing
48:46 - your learning online right yeah for sure
48:50 - and I think yeah looking back I think
48:53 - that notes blog did help me sort of
48:56 - eventually choose the Cod or coder
49:00 - Direction yeah so you're working at this
49:02 - agency you've been there for six years
49:05 - um at what point did you start like
49:07 - seriously taking or taking seriously the
49:09 - notion that like hey I could create
49:10 - tutorials on YouTube or I could write
49:13 - blog posts that actually help people
49:15 - like actually having an audience in mind
49:17 - rather than just yourself as your future
49:19 - self as the
49:21 - audience yeah um so I would have to say
49:24 - this whole time as I'd mentioned like I
49:27 - just enjoyed setting up blogs just for
49:29 - fun I also had this kind of like maybe
49:32 - entrepreneurial interest even from when
49:35 - I was a young kid like I remember when I
49:38 - was young I made this like vending
49:39 - machine out of a shoe box and I tried to
49:41 - sell it to my siblings and like I would
49:43 - just put like random candy and like
49:45 - peanuts in it and trying to make money
49:47 - off of them so I feel like I always was
49:50 - interested in not necessarily like
49:53 - making a lot of money and getting rich
49:55 - but again kind of creating this entity
49:58 - that worked in terms of operating as a
50:01 - business and letting me be autonomous
50:04 - which is a huge sort of core desire of
50:07 - my of mine like I really like the idea
50:10 - of kind of being independent and
50:12 - not having to be dependent on say a
50:15 - company or whatever um for my livelihood
50:18 - so I
50:19 - think you
50:21 - know when when you're working at a
50:23 - company I think there's good and there's
50:25 - bad and I think I saw both of those um
50:27 - in my time at the agency we had I think
50:29 - maybe one or two layoffs and those are
50:33 - incredibly demoralizing for the people
50:35 - who are laid off obviously but also the
50:37 - people who are left and it kind of
50:39 - really hits home that the company's not
50:41 - there to like help you like the
50:43 - company's there to exist as its own and
50:45 - you are it's kind of being built on the
50:47 - backs of the people working there every
50:50 - day so I think maybe with a little bit
50:53 - of um disillusionment I would say with
50:57 - the you know the whole like getting a
50:59 - corporate job and they'll take care of
51:00 - you and give you benefits y y which was
51:02 - very good um but I think and that may
51:05 - have been how it was back in the day
51:08 - when there was like zero competition
51:10 - like nobody went to college and uh you
51:12 - know if you served in the war that was
51:14 - probably good enough for you to be up to
51:16 - be like an executive and an advertising
51:18 - agency if you seen Mad Men like they
51:20 - always make fun of the college kids cuz
51:21 - they went to war when the college kids
51:23 - just went and like lived these yepy
51:25 - Lifestyles and stuff uh but but like
51:27 - things used to be a lot less competitive
51:28 - people would just drink martinis all day
51:30 - and like it was uh you know I mean like
51:33 - things have gotten so incredibly
51:35 - intensely competitive over the last 30
51:38 - or 40 years and I I don't think cut old
51:40 - folks understand frankly there's like a
51:42 - like a lack of empathy from like you
51:44 - know a lot of older folks I don't want
51:46 - to say all older folks there are
51:47 - definitely you know people from previous
51:50 - you know like people in their 70s and '
51:52 - 80s that do understand how hard young
51:54 - people have it but it has gotten so
51:55 - intensely competitive that uh any kind
51:59 - of like social contract between an
52:02 - employer and an employee that may used
52:04 - to exist when you were like a you know
52:06 - an IBM man or something like that right
52:09 - that is long gone right like there's
52:12 - nobody that can't be fired basically
52:14 - unless you're Mark Zuckerberg and you
52:15 - have like Ironclad control of like the
52:18 - the preferred chairs and you nobody can
52:20 - fire you like he can't get fired right
52:23 - Travis K in theory couldn't have been
52:25 - fired from Uber he he also had like
52:28 - super majority like shares and stuff he
52:31 - ultimately stepped down because there
52:32 - was just so much pressure on him if you
52:33 - watch super pumped on Netflix great show
52:36 - about entrepreneurialism not uh not safe
52:38 - for kids um to check it out it's great
52:42 - show I I've talked about it before and I
52:44 - I do recommend super pumped uh with
52:46 - perhaps one of my favorite actors uh
52:49 - today uh Joseph Gordon Levitz he does a
52:51 - great job representing Travis K the the
52:54 - most mocky valant business figure of our
52:56 - time
52:57 - but what I'm just trying to get to is
52:59 - like like anybody who says like we're a
53:02 - family you know blah like you know like
53:05 - run the other way if your employer
53:07 - doesn't accept that there is you know
53:09 - like you're a mercenary essentially uh
53:12 - and you can really like working at the
53:13 - job but at the same time just know that
53:16 - um you know companies ultimately have to
53:18 - respond to incentives from you know
53:20 - investors and other people like that and
53:22 - like you're just one of many people they
53:24 - don't like laying people off I don't
53:25 - think anybody enjoys let letting people
53:27 - go but as you saw twice just on the
53:30 - front lines your your colleagues getting
53:33 - let go like that that happens and um
53:37 - yeah that was that one of the reasons
53:39 - why you like ultimately wanted to get
53:41 - out of the proverbial Rat Race and like
53:44 - become independent I think eventually
53:46 - but I think
53:48 - I I also had sort of discovered the
53:50 - whole like idea of blogging as like a
53:53 - income Source um I think you know this
53:57 - is back in the I would say maybe 2010s
53:59 - or so this is when blogging was like
54:01 - really I would say at its peak with like
54:03 - you could you could make money off of
54:04 - like affiliate links and all this kind
54:05 - of stuff and so I think I since I loved
54:09 - blogging I was like oh this could be
54:12 - something that I could do and I think I
54:14 - was kind of searching for a way that I
54:16 - could make money on my own without
54:18 - having to be dependent on a company and
54:21 - I'd read this book called um the $100
54:24 - startup by Chris Gilbo
54:27 - um and I remember this is this is how
54:28 - coder coder started so like I was on a
54:30 - flight to Japan to visit my friend and I
54:32 - was reading this startup book on the
54:35 - plane and Chris Gilbo asks you like okay
54:39 - to figure out what business idea you can
54:41 - come up with like what are you
54:43 - passionate about and what can you know
54:46 - you what can you do to help other people
54:50 - and so for me I was like oh I would say
54:52 - I'm passionate about coding I really
54:53 - enjoy building websites and I think it's
54:55 - a skill that I could you know share with
54:58 - other people and help them to basically
55:00 - do what I did because you know coding
55:03 - took me from working these temporary
55:05 - office gigs to having like a very stable
55:09 - like well-paying career and so I felt
55:11 - like that moment of realization of like
55:14 - oh I should do this like I want to do
55:17 - this and so that's kind of how I started
55:19 - like getting more serious about writing
55:22 - coding tutorials on my blog and then I
55:24 - also got into Instagram I found out
55:25 - there was like a whole develop our
55:26 - community on Instagram which was like
55:28 - really cool because um in my job like my
55:31 - co-workers were great but like I only
55:35 - had worked with like male co-workers
55:37 - like there were no other women um like
55:40 - at my job the entire time that I worked
55:42 - there so seeing on Instagram that there
55:44 - were like you
55:46 - know other people doing web development
55:49 - who you know looked more like me was
55:51 - like a really cool sense of community
55:53 - and so I kind of like fell into like
55:56 - those sort of areas in terms of like
55:58 - online you know webd type of stuff um so
56:03 - yeah that's how coder coder
56:06 - started yeah um yeah yeah that that's
56:10 - really cool so I mean you brought up an
56:13 - important point about the fact that like
56:14 - the field was very male-dominated um at
56:16 - the time and uh so just just to finish
56:21 - kind of like the the origin story um and
56:24 - establish our chronology we're going to
56:26 - be drawing from for the rest of the
56:27 - conversation so you you did leave this
56:30 - job at the um at the agency and was that
56:33 - to ultimately go into freelancing
56:36 - yourself um yeah so I left the
56:38 - agency because I was trying
56:41 - to do freelance and sort of build up
56:44 - like the coder coder thing so I did end
56:47 - up freelancing for the agency for a
56:49 - little bit after even after I left um
56:51 - but I think it was just nice
56:53 - to yeah have less of the sort of
56:56 - expectations and everything um but yeah
56:59 - so I did freelance for I would say a
57:02 - long time maybe like three or four years
57:06 - um and then I I did freelancing for like
57:08 - other like another company as well
57:11 - before I quit that a couple years ago so
57:14 - you were able to kind of like taper off
57:16 - having people go out and find clients
57:17 - for you essentially that's what like an
57:19 - agency does it it kind of like puts
57:21 - Under One Roof like both the sales side
57:23 - and the actual like I guess production
57:25 - side
57:27 - uh that's probably an oversimplification
57:28 - I've never worked at an agency uh I have
57:30 - people that swear by working at agencies
57:32 - that love agency life like Cass Marino
57:34 - CSS artist whom you can watch an
57:36 - interview with here on the fre C Camp uh
57:39 - YouTube channel or on the uh that listen
57:40 - you can listen on the free C Camp
57:42 - podcast she's amazing uh but
57:45 - uh I'm really interested in kind of like
57:48 - how you tapered that off and how you
57:49 - went out and got your own clients
57:51 - because that is something that a lot of
57:52 - people listening to this would like to
57:54 - ultimately freelance and have their own
57:57 - kind of
57:59 - consultancy yeah
58:01 - um I mean to be honest I
58:04 - never was like having to find my own
58:06 - clients because my clients were
58:08 - companies if that makes sense so like my
58:10 - first client was obviously my old agency
58:12 - and then um just through knowing
58:15 - co-workers who moved on to other
58:16 - companies like they were hiring
58:18 - Freelancers as well so I was doing
58:21 - freelance jobs for like their new
58:23 - companies and stuff like that um so I
58:25 - never did the the whole like you know
58:26 - local like try to find you know local
58:29 - businesses to to build up your clientele
58:32 - but I do know that's very possible
58:34 - that's such an interesting departure
58:36 - from what a lot of the other people who
58:37 - do fre so essentially you built like
58:40 - this network from working in an agency
58:42 - for so long uh that you already had like
58:45 - kind of all the connective tissue you
58:47 - needed to be able to just continue to
58:49 - Coast on those
58:52 - relationships yeah yeah for sure I think
58:55 - I had a very very yeah I'm very
58:57 - fortunate that I benefited from my my
58:59 - networking um back then and yeah just
59:02 - able to find different freelance gigs um
59:07 - yeah yeah and the entire time you're
59:10 - blogging and as you said in the early
59:12 - 2010s blogging was at its Heyday you
59:14 - could slap AdSense on a blog or
59:16 - potentially get like sponsorships or do
59:18 - other things like that and you could
59:20 - actually make real money blogging now
59:22 - can you make real money blogging well I
59:24 - am going to tell you how much money free
59:26 - Cod camps publication Mi right we do uh
59:30 - millions of page views a month uh on
59:33 - that and we just have like Google
59:34 - AdSense running and I think we make like
59:36 - maybe like 10 or 15K a month from like
59:39 - the ads the show on there it's not a lot
59:41 - of money when you consider like the
59:42 - entire staff millions of and yeah like
59:45 - like we have an editorial team uh we we
59:48 - have a a ton of volunteer contributors
59:51 - who write their excellent tutorials and
59:53 - publish up there I published my entire
59:55 - book if you Google learn the code book
59:57 - it's free it's all on freecodecamp.org
60:00 - newsnews that's our publication um and
60:03 - we published tons of tutorials there
60:04 - every week we probably publish like 20
60:06 - tutorials a week and including a lot of
60:08 - full length books and handbooks we've
60:09 - got more than 100 books through freeo
60:11 - Camp press which is really just us
60:12 - publishing through our CMS but uh yeah
60:15 - like there's no way that I was like an
60:18 - individual author trying to live off
60:20 - AdSense that I'd be able to right we've
60:21 - got like all this momentum from SEO and
60:24 - like just being around and like having
60:26 - reputation and all everything we do free
60:28 - Cod Camp kind of like feeds into like
60:30 - people knowing that free Cod Camp exists
60:31 - I wear the free Cod camp shirt literally
60:33 - everywhere I go you know it's like FR
60:35 - I've got like 10 of these and I just
60:36 - wear them every day um it's my uniform I
60:38 - got to be a billboard for for this
60:40 - charity right uh so so you know 15K I
60:45 - don't imagine you were making even close
60:46 - to 15K off just ad ad Revenue but like
60:49 - maybe you could talk about how you were
60:51 - able to gradually become more of a
60:55 - content creator and less of a uh
60:58 - freelancer yeah so I think it grew I
61:01 - would say pretty slowly so like
61:03 - initially I had the blog and I don't
61:05 - know if I even put ads on the blog
61:07 - initially I think the only way I was
61:09 - making money was Amazon affiliate links
61:13 - um and it was doing like it was doing
61:16 - okay but it wasn't
61:18 - like I mean when you say okay if you
61:20 - wouldn't mind giving like could you
61:22 - could you tell us um if I can remember I
61:25 - would would
61:26 - [Music]
61:28 - say maybe
61:30 - like I would say
61:32 - $200 a month would be pretty good oh wow
61:36 - okay so so that's from Amazon affiliate
61:38 - links like yeah and now if you try to do
61:40 - Amazon affiliate links I think I've
61:42 - heard it's a lot less like they really
61:44 - don't care about the affiliate Market
61:45 - yeah yeah so I think that the the the
61:48 - landscape in terms of online like
61:50 - moneymaking has definitely changed you
61:52 - cannot you cannot live off of
61:54 - ads and affiliate links alone you you
61:57 - need other you need other Diversified
62:00 - channels of income for
62:03 - sure yeah yeah so um what were your what
62:07 - was your like I guess Revenue stack if
62:09 - you will like how were you able to like
62:13 - uh to make it
62:15 - work yeah so I think things changed a
62:17 - lot when I decided to go into YouTube um
62:20 - and not just writing text tutorials but
62:22 - like you know doing these screencasts
62:23 - and other things and so that started
62:26 - probably it was had like like stops and
62:29 - starts so I think the first YouTube
62:31 - video was uploaded in like 2017 and then
62:34 - I didn't upload another video for like a
62:35 - year or two years um but I did
62:39 - eventually start being more consistent
62:41 - about uploading videos and things
62:45 - started taking off in
62:47 - 2020 like I think when the pandemic hit
62:49 - everyone was just like online 24/7 so
62:53 - like back then there were a lot of
62:55 - people watching YouTube videos so that
62:57 - was kind of when my channel started
62:58 - growing a lot and I was able to make
63:02 - money off of
63:03 - AdSense I think maybe since then maybe
63:07 - the max that I would do was like 1,500 a
63:11 - month from just AdSense which was pretty
63:13 - good um and then I also had some
63:16 - affiliate links and that was bringing in
63:17 - about the same per month um but okay so
63:20 - so you're making about $33,000 a month
63:23 - just as a Creator and you're still doing
63:25 - Consulting work at this point or were
63:28 - you I was doing freelancing um and then
63:31 - at some point I was like I think when I
63:33 - hit that three 3K a month Mark I was
63:35 - like all right let's like just try to do
63:38 - coder coder and not do freelance anymore
63:41 - so I stopped doing freelance I would say
63:43 - maybe 20 22 just like just like a couple
63:46 - years
63:47 - ago yeah and to put this in context like
63:50 - for a lot of people listening to this
63:52 - they may be single or uh not like Mar or
63:56 - you know maybe in a situation where they
63:58 - they are not able to get health
63:59 - insurance your your husband uh is an
64:03 - accomplished animator uh if you wouldn't
64:05 - talk if you wouldn't mind talking a
64:06 - little bit about him and like the role
64:08 - he played in you being able to make this
64:09 - transition cuz my wife was absolutely
64:11 - instrumental and me being able to make
64:13 - the trans transition she was working you
64:15 - know in Tech doing accounting and we had
64:17 - health insurance she wasn't making just
64:19 - a ton of money cuz she was she wasn't a
64:21 - developer she was like doing accounting
64:22 - and stuff and which is like half a
64:25 - quarter of 10th of what developers make
64:27 - but uh but that insurance was very
64:29 - helpful and also the fact that we just
64:31 - had like a consistent Baseline like the
64:34 - rent was basically covered just from her
64:36 - income and stuff uh so that gave me the
64:38 - flexibility to take more risks if I were
64:40 - a single person uh and I didn't have
64:43 - like and I also had like a lot of
64:44 - savings and I've famously plowed like
64:47 - $150,000 of my own Savings in a free Cod
64:49 - camp and that was money that like I
64:50 - earned over like 10 years working as a
64:52 - teacher basically like you can imagine
64:54 - what a teacher I basically saved half of
64:57 - everything I I earned and I also like
64:59 - hustled back in the day like you hear
65:01 - about this all the time and I'm not sure
65:02 - if you can even make money on it anymore
65:03 - but I I would like buy tons of old like
65:06 - video games and stuff that like
65:07 - Collectibles things like that on
65:09 - Craigslist go to like you know buy Big
65:12 - Lots of these things and then I break
65:14 - them down and sell them kind of piece
65:15 - them out on eBay and sell them that way
65:17 - and that so that's how I like the the
65:20 - small fortune you know $150,000 that I
65:23 - used to fund develop like the first few
65:25 - years of free Camp before we got our tax
65:27 - income status
65:29 - but the entire time of course we also
65:31 - had my wife's income so it just uh so so
65:34 - I always like to point out like your
65:36 - situation your circumstances are going
65:38 - to be different from mine and Jessica so
65:40 - just factor that in your mileage May VAR
65:43 - and also factor that in when you hear
65:44 - these getrich quick schemer type people
65:47 - or like these like oh like the you know
65:49 - the hustle culture Bros and people like
65:51 - that right like you know there is risk
65:55 - in trying to become a Creator there is
65:57 - risk in trying to become a freelancer
65:58 - there's risk in taking time off to like
66:00 - learn to code in hopes of getting a
66:02 - developer job and uh I think people are
66:04 - remiss when they don't acknowledge that
66:07 - risk but anyway sorry with that sidebar
66:10 - your husband um yeah so my husband
66:13 - actually is also a freelancer so
66:15 - unfortunately we are paying um out of
66:19 - pocket for Private health insurance and
66:21 - it's like very expensive um I think I
66:24 - remember I had a friend who was talking
66:25 - to who lives in Canada and I was talking
66:28 - about how we have to pay for our own
66:29 - health insurance he's like oh like how
66:31 - much is it I was like you know it's like
66:33 - $1,000 a month for like two people and
66:35 - she was like what because like she was
66:37 - and she was like I'm complaining about
66:39 - spending $50 a month on my Canadian
66:41 - health insurance so like that was just
66:43 - like a huge like I think eye opening
66:46 - moment for yeah yeah so it's it's very
66:50 - expensive in America to pay for
66:52 - insurance yourself um but we I think we
66:56 - make it work because we do have savings
67:00 - and we also live in kind of a
67:02 - lower um cost of what's it called cost
67:06 - of living lower cost of living part of
67:08 - the country so that helps too um cuz you
67:13 - know if you want to live in like LA or
67:15 - New York or you know wherever it's like
67:18 - I think there's definitely obviously
67:20 - benefits to that and there's a reason
67:21 - why so many people want to live there
67:23 - but you know I remember reading about um
67:25 - Chris coyer from CSS tricks and finding
67:27 - out that he lives like up in Wisconsin
67:29 - or something and I think that was for me
67:32 - at least the realization of like oh you
67:33 - can like still have a really big online
67:36 - presence and be a part of you know the
67:39 - whole Community but you don't have to
67:41 - live in like these bigname cities so
67:43 - yeah I think that yeah a lot of those
67:46 - those Heavies as I like to call them in
67:48 - the teaching space you know Chris Kyer
67:50 - of course uh great dude whom we hope to
67:53 - have uh on the podcast at some point uh
67:56 - yes West boss Scott stalinsky uh like a
67:59 - lot of the kind of like the I guess the
68:02 - people that preceded me uh like like
68:05 - whom I looked up to and learned from
68:07 - very early on and probably you and like
68:09 - a lot of other people also look up to
68:11 - and learned from them they live out in
68:12 - the middle of
68:14 - nowhere and and
68:16 - like yeah and so you don't have to live
68:20 - in SF it absolutely helps and I did live
68:22 - in SF during the early first few years
68:25 - um free cooking SF San Francisco I moved
68:27 - out there because that's the tech Mecca
68:29 - and for me it wasn't that big a deal
68:30 - because I was already living in like
68:32 - Southern California so I just went up
68:34 - there and slept on my friend's couch uh
68:36 - for a few months and then I eventually
68:38 - was able my wife was able to transfer
68:39 - within her company up there and we were
68:41 - able to make it work inff but we we're
68:43 - living in a a one bedroom shoe box it's
68:46 - like 600 square F feet and we were
68:47 - paying like a ton of money to live there
68:50 - and so you know it's definitely for me
68:52 - it was a phase it was like a stage if
68:54 - you look at like a rocket you know how
68:56 - there's like the booster stage that was
68:57 - the booster stage and now like we're a
68:59 - little higher up you know we don't need
69:01 - as much fuel to like keep keep ascending
69:04 - or something like that I don't know it's
69:05 - a weird analogy but it sounds like you
69:07 - and your husband and and by the way I
69:10 - also get like Obamacare like I pay from
69:12 - the private Market as well and like most
69:14 - people I know do unless they're at like
69:16 - some big company that has like fancy
69:18 - health insurance and if you're getting
69:20 - health insurance you're paying for it
69:21 - some way right like you're probably
69:22 - getting a lower you know uh compensation
69:26 - in some other form because that
69:28 - benefit employees are sophisticated they
69:30 - look at you as the total cost of having
69:32 - this person fill this cubicle seat right
69:35 - um they're they're not unsophisticated
69:37 - and they're not Charities right like
69:39 - free COC is literally a charity but its
69:42 - purpose is not to be charitable to the
69:44 - people that work at free c yeah it's to
69:46 - be to serve a charitable purpose which
69:48 - our our mission our charitable tax exam
69:50 - purpose from the IRS to create free
69:52 - learning resources like this podcast
69:54 - you're watching right now
69:56 - and uh I'll just while I'm ranting about
69:58 - freeo I'll just say you can become one
70:00 - of the 9 million plus 9 million sorry I
70:03 - wish it was 9 million 9,000 plus I think
70:05 - it's like 9,000 and3 we just crossed
70:07 - 9,000 uh recently people who support
70:10 - free C Camp each month with a small
70:13 - donation of like $5 a month or something
70:14 - like that you go to freec camp.org
70:16 - donate you make all this possible the
70:18 - the courses the Interactive Learning
70:20 - platform the text based tutorials the
70:22 - books uh everything so um shout out to
70:25 - all those those kind folks and if you're
70:26 - watching uh thank you um or if you're
70:30 - listening I always listen to the audio
70:31 - version I don't actually watch the video
70:33 - version but like we have a lot of people
70:35 - that watch the video so they get to look
70:37 - at like the cool video I put on in the
70:39 - background so that people don't just
70:40 - have to look at my face for two hours
70:42 - they can look at like a trct mode of
70:43 - some old Japanese arcade game from the
70:45 - 80s okay
70:47 - so back to uh like just day-to-day
70:51 - living as a freelancer so your husband
70:53 - is no stranger at a freelancer
70:55 - life he is doing
70:57 - animation his animation is amazing I
71:00 - don't know if he also does the sound
71:01 - design but like just like the the candy
71:04 - anything yeah yeah and and like so again
71:07 - I'm going to link to uh that one video
71:09 - about your coding Journey uh which what
71:11 - we just talked about at length over the
71:12 - last hour you can like learn all that in
71:14 - six minutes with really cool Pokemon
71:17 - kind of Earthbound looking uh animations
71:20 - and stuff um by the way I was like
71:23 - watching that video I was like uh I
71:25 - hadn't seen it in like four years since
71:27 - you first published it and last night I
71:28 - watched it um and I also I showed it to
71:30 - my kids um back in the day but like I I
71:33 - left this really lengthy comment on on
71:35 - YouTube like anybody who leaves comments
71:37 - on YouTube if you ever feel like man
71:39 - YouTube just like did anybody even see
71:41 - my comment I don't think anybody saw
71:42 - this comment you saw it you like put
71:44 - like the heart thing which you can do if
71:45 - you're the creator of the video but like
71:48 - it had one thumbs up and that was
71:50 - probably you I like spent probably like
71:53 - 5 minutes like you know coming with this
71:55 - really
71:56 - compliment I think Brad traversy who
71:59 - runs uh you know uh traversy media he's
72:01 - jumped in he's like great video and it
72:03 - had like 2,000 upvotes and like so I I
72:07 - genuinely believe that YouTube is like
72:09 - heavily biased on toward people who
72:10 - leave comments within the first few
72:12 - minutes those are the ones that people
72:13 - are going to like and it those are the
72:14 - comments that are going to rise to the
72:16 - top so if anybody ever leaves a video
72:18 - and you feel neglected or if you ever
72:20 - leave a comment on a video and you feel
72:21 - neglected know that I'm right there with
72:23 - you and that I feel robbed by YouTube's
72:25 - comment algorithm I spent so much time
72:27 - coming up like 5 minutes of My Life
72:29 - coming up with that comment and nobody
72:31 - saw it yeah anyway definitely heavily
72:34 - weighted toward the early early stuff
72:37 - yeah so uh so you've got approximately
72:41 - uh $3,000 a month uh in income uh and
72:44 - you're paying a th000 of that just to uh
72:47 - private insurance and stuff like that
72:48 - but like where do you go from there and
72:50 - how do you build out this coder coder
72:52 - brand uh and this kind of like High
72:55 - touch polished like fancy animation like
72:58 - really high energy uh I mean it's almost
73:02 - like you're definitely the highest
73:04 - production Creator in the uh tutorial
73:08 - space in my humble opinion oh unless
73:10 - missing like I don't know anybody that
73:12 - like puts as much thought and
73:14 - deliberation into every minute of a
73:15 - video as you
73:17 - do yeah I mean there's there's
73:20 - definitely a lot of really great
73:21 - creators in the space like fire ship and
73:24 - um there's like some new channel that
73:25 - are pretty pretty good like hyperplex a
73:28 - lot of Animation Stu but yeah thank you
73:30 - you're you're very kind I will pass on
73:32 - the the compliments to my husband
73:36 - um yeah so sorry the question is like
73:39 - how do I yeah like how do things unfold
73:42 - from there like like what what are some
73:44 - of the main things you've learned
73:45 - creating these video
73:47 - tutorials I would actually say that yes
73:50 - I acknowledge I have a very unfair
73:52 - advantage in terms of being married to
73:55 - an incredibly talented animator and
73:57 - editor um but I would actually say that
74:01 - you can't rely you can't just Coast on
74:03 - like the sizzle you do need to have like
74:06 - content so I think I would actually say
74:08 - that one of
74:10 - the main maybe benefits of my videos
74:13 - that I really try to go in depth in the
74:16 - tutorials so like I spend a lot of time
74:18 - when I'm writing scripts for the videos
74:20 - one writing a script because I'm
74:22 - terrible ad living I've gotten better
74:24 - over time
74:25 - but um I like writing everything out and
74:28 - I do a lot of research on like I read
74:30 - like the um Mozilla developer Network a
74:33 - lot I also read the actual like um what
74:35 - is it the the HTML spec from the the W3
74:39 - and that is like bedtime reading it's
74:42 - like incredibly dense and hard to pick
74:46 - out the meaning but you know I do it
74:49 - when I have to so I would say that like
74:51 - I try really hard to do a lot of depth
74:55 - research but also present that in-depth
74:57 - information in a way that is accessible
74:59 - to people who are not you know experts
75:02 - in the field because I think that's
75:04 - really important to be able to talk to
75:07 - people at the level that they're at and
75:09 - sort of guide them through their own
75:11 - Learning Journey so that's I would say
75:14 - that's the most important thing that I
75:16 - try to do in all my videos so research
75:19 - and preparation so by the time you like
75:22 - turn on the camera or turn on the mics
75:24 - you've already spent a great deal of
75:25 - time thinking about the topic that
75:26 - you're going to talk about and uh yeah
75:29 - and and it shows it comes through in
75:31 - your videos that you're like pretty
75:32 - authoritative and and you're pretty
75:34 - definitive um and and also it's just
75:38 - like really compressed like you said
75:39 - Fire Ship is famous for having like
75:40 - these three minute videos that are funny
75:42 - and just like overload of memes and
75:44 - stuff like that um and like like C in
75:48 - three minutes or something like that
75:49 - right like those kinds of videos those
75:50 - are cool those those are fun uh and then
75:53 - you have like the polar opposite where
75:55 - these long winding conversations between
75:58 - two people who have done stuff you know
76:00 - over here on the freeo camp podcast
76:02 - right so um zero production value just
76:06 - just Personality yeah so good content
76:10 - yeah exactly and like again I listen to
76:13 - so many pocket people like I I
76:15 - interviewed
76:16 - Scott uh sininsky not Scott Selinsky uh
76:19 - Scott the other Pro Scott Hanselman yes
76:23 - he like how do you do it like who listen
76:24 - list to this stuff like who has time to
76:26 - listen to but I listen to this stuff all
76:28 - the time I learned so much for like long
76:31 - interviews um and I feel like they they
76:33 - surface a whole lot of you know
76:35 - interesting stuff that wouldn't come out
76:36 - in like a polished like if you were to
76:38 - go on Good Morning America which uh you
76:40 - know is like like you're lucky if they
76:42 - take like three sentences of what you
76:44 - say and put it on there right so for
76:47 - sure I I have so many questions for you
76:50 - we haven't even gotten to them and I'm
76:51 - just going to start firing them off sure
76:53 - right uh so you worked seven years at
76:56 - your first job would you recommend
76:58 - people stay at their first job for seven
77:01 - years I think if it works for you I
77:04 - think if I stayed as long as I did
77:06 - because I felt like I was constantly
77:07 - learning and like I didn't plateau and I
77:09 - felt like it was a
77:11 - reasonably not toxic environment for the
77:14 - most part and so I think it really
77:16 - depends on the situation but I do think
77:18 - that it can be a benefit to start at one
77:20 - company and kind of you know work your
77:22 - way up and get experience there um
77:25 - yeah varies you yeah absolutely you have
77:29 - a really cool like background like area
77:31 - it looks like you got a nice bookshelf
77:32 - you may actually have the same it's not
77:34 - the same bookshelf it's a similar
77:35 - bookshelf I got it on like
77:38 - Wayfair but but like you've got like a
77:41 - cool kind of like setup over there and
77:43 - like I imagine you know you're into like
77:45 - mechanical keyboards and stuff like that
77:47 - uh like just like the Aesthetics of
77:49 - getting work done mhm especially as like
77:52 - an more artist artistic minded person
77:54 - who who is like studyed photography and
77:56 - probably like you know you know Mary
77:58 - condo cell like looks thinks about like
78:00 - all the different little details and
78:01 - stuff right I
78:03 - try so maybe you could talk about your
78:07 - setup and like how you get in your happy
78:09 - place for getting work done oh yeah
78:11 - that's a big question um I'm going to be
78:15 - completely honest here so I've worked
78:18 - remotely for the past seven years um
78:22 - some of it was at the agency where I
78:23 - actually worked remotely and started out
78:25 - working in the physical office but
78:27 - motivation has been a
78:30 - huge like I cannot overestimate how much
78:33 - of a struggle staying motivated has been
78:36 - um working remotely and then also just
78:38 - like working for myself essentially um
78:42 - I'm still like figuring it out but like
78:47 - I I'm very embarrassed
78:50 - about like the thought of what I do with
78:53 - my day um like you've seen those videos
78:56 - where it's like you know day in the life
78:57 - of a programmer and like you see all the
78:59 - things that they do it's like everyone's
79:00 - like waking up at 6:00 a. and stuff it's
79:02 - like I do not wake up at 6:00 a.m. my
79:05 - sleep schedules can very swing
79:09 - widely um and I'm definitely not like
79:13 - sit down the desk for eight hours and
79:15 - like type away so it's like it's been a
79:18 - pretty big struggle if I'm honest and I
79:20 - think you know the whole pandemic was
79:21 - part of that too I think um yeah yeah
79:24 - just made things hard but I'm hopefully
79:29 - getting better at motivating myself but
79:33 - it's yeah it's hard man especially when
79:35 - you're just at home all the time yeah
79:37 - when you have to turn it on when you're
79:39 - like man I got this deadline like or I
79:42 - committed to this goal of mine maybe
79:44 - nobody else uh knows about it but you
79:47 - like want to hold yourself accountable
79:48 - like how do you fire yourself up to to
79:51 - get things done do you have any sort of
79:52 - ritual or some sort of like fallback
79:55 - some sort of song that you put on that
79:56 - like you know the rocky
79:59 - them like something that you do to like
80:02 - to to get on point for me
80:07 - um yeah I'm still figuring that part out
80:11 - but I will say there's this guy on
80:13 - YouTube called struthless he's a tattoo
80:15 - artist but he makes really cool videos
80:18 - on a lot of them are like productivity
80:19 - and motivation and stuff like that and
80:21 - just like artistic stuff and he had this
80:23 - whole video on motivation and he named
80:26 - something called the dark why so it's
80:30 - this idea that when we think about
80:32 - motivation we want to think like oh like
80:34 - I'm you know it's like all good it's all
80:37 - like positive stuff but in reality
80:39 - people are really motivated by either
80:41 - getting away from or proving something
80:43 - wrong or like avoiding these like bad
80:45 - things that we don't want to happen and
80:48 - I think that that is true for me for
80:50 - sure so for example I've been working on
80:53 - this course for like I don't know how
80:54 - how many years now it's been again a big
80:56 - struggle but I think um when I had a
81:02 - early access launch back in November um
81:04 - last year that was my like drop dead
81:07 - deadline where it's like this has to be
81:09 - done before that point otherwise I've
81:12 - already said it publicly what the launch
81:13 - date is I'm going to like hugely
81:15 - embarrass myself and also disappoint
81:17 - myself if I don't make that deadline so
81:20 - once I had that external deadline that
81:22 - really like lit a fire under my butt and
81:27 - got me to just like the finish line so I
81:30 - think I think a lot of it is just
81:32 - figuring out how you operate and what
81:34 - things actually can motivate you um but
81:39 - yeah also not to sound cliche but I
81:41 - think not letting myself scroll on
81:43 - Reddit all the time helped a lot so just
81:46 - kind of like limiting that social media
81:48 - phone time I think helps helps your
81:52 - brain yeah 100% I will second that uh I
81:56 - um I don't spend any time on Reddit uh
81:59 - in fact Reddit timed me out as a mod for
82:01 - my own subreddit oh no R free Coke camp
82:03 - like I in like inactive status it's this
82:06 - badge and I'm the I'm the mod like I
82:08 - created the free C Camp subred right and
82:11 - they won't let me like add Naomi from
82:13 - our team as a as a mom because I'm
82:15 - inactive so I have to post on Reddit and
82:17 - like you see me posting on Reddit just
82:19 - say hey great job like I mean it I am
82:22 - impressed by the project he just
82:23 - submitted but like I'm also trying to
82:27 - get reddit's algorithm to uh to say like
82:30 - okay he's he's active again he can add
82:32 - new me as a mod now so uh but but yeah
82:34 - like that like the amount of time I
82:36 - spent on social media is like
82:37 - vanishingly small and it used to be this
82:39 - huge good part like I've I've definitely
82:41 - mellowed out not spending time there um
82:45 - yeah not that it's not incredibly useful
82:47 - yeah but but yeah you've worked for
82:49 - yourself for a long time like have how
82:51 - do you sort of stay motivated because it
82:53 - feels like you're working on like 20
82:55 - different amazing things at the same
82:57 - time well thank you uh I'm I'm glad it
83:00 - looks good from the outside because
83:02 - every organization from the inside like
83:03 - every person's life I think feels like
83:05 - it's probably a mess because you have
83:06 - access to all the gritty details um but
83:10 - I mean like
83:12 - like one of our guests um Phoebe vong
83:15 - Fidel um she talked about how like
83:17 - having kids was like the biggest
83:19 - productivity Boon in her life cuz
83:21 - suddenly she had to be accountable of
83:23 - the kid and it took up so much of her
83:24 - time that she had to figure out how to
83:26 - like structure the rest of her time so
83:28 - that she could be as productive as she
83:29 - was before she had kids and that's a
83:31 - that's a great interview recommend
83:32 - everybody check it out um but but like
83:35 - you know she learned like you she
83:36 - learned a code at like 36 or something
83:38 - right and uh it it was having that
83:40 - extrinsic pressure of like I've got this
83:42 - kid that's constantly crying and I need
83:44 - to get things done in between dealing
83:45 - with this kid and like I I would say
83:48 - like the first few years of free COC I
83:50 - was just pure ID I don't know what to
83:53 - say but but it's was just like like I
83:55 - really don't like for-profit education I
83:57 - don't like student debt I don't like
83:59 - like it it was kind of like a rage that
84:01 - was driving me and it's a dark why yeah
84:05 - my dark why I like I am so upset that
84:08 - we're in the most prosperous country in
84:10 - the world and that there's suffering
84:11 - that there's homelessness that there are
84:13 - uh people who don't have access to
84:16 - opportunity just because of where they
84:18 - were born if they were born in like
84:20 - Appalachia or you know uh Middle America
84:23 - like where I was where I grew up and
84:25 - there just was an expectation that like
84:26 - you'd be a construction worker when you
84:27 - grew up or something like that right
84:29 - like uh I definitely that was what fired
84:33 - me up initially was just like wanting to
84:35 - destroy the for-profit education complex
84:39 - and make education free like I and I
84:41 - still feel that way but I've mellowed
84:43 - out a lot and a lot of my productivity
84:45 - is not based on emotion it's based on
84:47 - like okay like I've got systems that
84:49 - keep me accountable like I wake up at
84:51 - 7:00 a.m. every day because I've got
84:54 - kids and they're like roosters and they
84:55 - jump out of bed at 7:00 a.m. full energy
84:58 - and you're up when they're up right
85:00 - there's no sleeping through kids jumping
85:02 - on your bed and like uh you know
85:04 - stealing your phone and watching like
85:05 - Zelda videos at full blast and stuff
85:07 - like that um yeah so so like that that
85:11 - is kind of and and then just like all
85:13 - the normal diet exercise like if you
85:15 - live in one place for long enough uh and
85:17 - you you establish some routines you you
85:19 - can kind of Coast on those routines uh
85:21 - like you know like like today I woke up
85:24 - took my kids to school uh I went to the
85:26 - YMCA I exercised I walked home entire
85:29 - time I was thinking about this interview
85:30 - and like preparing and I I did my
85:32 - research I had like three pages of notes
85:34 - I was you know questions I was going to
85:35 - ask it's just a bunch of prep uh and
85:38 - then that prep carries you you know
85:40 - sorry for that little like weird inhale
85:42 - thing um I'm not going to edit it out
85:44 - because I don't edit okay keep
85:47 - um yeah uh I I feel like people need a
85:51 - source of like real human beings on the
85:52 - internet who are not fronting and Max
85:54 - you know who were just being themselves
85:56 - and uh not trying to impress people I'm
85:58 - not trying to impress anybody I'm trying
86:00 - to teach people and you know potentially
86:02 - Enlighten them about the nature of
86:04 - reality it's not these perfect human
86:06 - beings it's not like James Bond not
86:08 - getting killed the first time he goes on
86:10 - a mission because he's a ostentatious
86:12 - bastard you
86:13 - know he be the worst spy the real spies
86:17 - you never even hear about right so
86:20 - anyway
86:22 - true so um
86:24 - I want to draw some more insight out of
86:26 - you because you just have some and and I
86:28 - also want to be mindful of your time uh
86:30 - so uh we have like 13 minutes I'm just
86:32 - going to start firing away all right
86:33 - you're very you're very vocal about uh
86:38 - how how you look things up all the time
86:40 - like this is a huge part of your message
86:42 - to developers it's like developers are
86:44 - not omniscient they don't have like Tic
86:47 - memories where they've just committed
86:48 - the mdn to their brain right you're
86:50 - constantly looking things up and can you
86:52 - talk about that and like how you did you
86:55 - ever did you feel weird about that when
86:56 - you were like aren't developers supposed
86:58 - to be smart and just know this
87:00 - stuff yeah I mean I think I was lucky
87:04 - that I when I was starting out in my
87:06 - career like I had other developers
87:07 - around me and I think it was it seemed
87:09 - pretty accepted that everyone looked up
87:11 - stuff all the time so I think that at
87:14 - least I didn't have any sort of like you
87:16 - know false impressions of what a real
87:19 - real developer does but I noticed that
87:21 - when I started putting out some videos I
87:24 - think early on I did these live coding
87:26 - um live streams actually on my channel
87:29 - and I would try to build a website from
87:30 - a design which is my whole shtick I
87:32 - guess and I would spend a lot of time
87:35 - looking things up on stack Overflow or
87:36 - reading the docs and I used to remember
87:38 - getting all these comments from people
87:40 - being like Oh my gosh like real
87:43 - developers like do lookup stuff and so I
87:45 - think that really like sort of stuck
87:47 - with me that if you're just learning how
87:49 - to code on your own and you don't have
87:51 - any knowledge about the industry like
87:52 - it's very easy to think like oh these
87:54 - people on YouTube or professionals
87:57 - working at companies like they don't
87:58 - have to look anything up like everything
87:59 - is just like living in their brain
88:01 - 247 and it's just like a library up
88:04 - there but that's really not true because
88:06 - there's just so much knowledge there's
88:08 - so many areas in programming and web
88:10 - development and also things are changing
88:11 - all the time especially now nowadays um
88:15 - yeah things just change so quickly so
88:17 - you have to that's just part of the
88:19 - routine so I think it's really important
88:21 - for me to like keep it real and just
88:23 - like show people people like real web
88:25 - developers like look up stuff all the
88:27 - time yeah and it's not going to get any
88:30 - better like like it's always going to be
88:31 - like that because by definition the
88:33 - field is like people operating at the
88:35 - frontier of what the tools are capable
88:37 - of if the tool abstracted something away
88:38 - then you wouldn't need to do that
88:39 - anymore so you're always going to be
88:41 - working with like higher and higher
88:42 - levels of abstraction probably unless
88:44 - you have like really crazy constraints
88:45 - like we need this chip to work on this
88:47 - satellite and it needs to work for 2,000
88:49 - years or something like that right yeah
88:50 - so
88:52 - um Okay so you know those kind of edge
88:55 - cases aside like you're going to be
88:56 - using lots of tools you're going to be
88:58 - using the raw compute power and like all
89:00 - the other stuff that gets better every
89:01 - year what kind of uh when you were
89:03 - developing uh websites and apps as a
89:06 - consultant what were kind of your bread
89:07 - and butter types of elements and things
89:09 - that you just build over and over again
89:11 - H that's a really good question
89:15 - um I think like the whole like card UI
89:19 - where it's like you have different cards
89:20 - with like photos and like things like
89:22 - that and I think
89:24 - just when I was learning it there was no
89:27 - flex box initially so you had to like
89:29 - lay out things with CSS float which was
89:32 - kind of a nightmare um but yeah I think
89:35 - just like getting good at these sort of
89:37 - multi column layouts that stack to one
89:39 - column on mobile like that was I would
89:41 - say 90% of my job um working in
89:44 - advertising and marketing yeah were
89:47 - there any UI kind of dark patterns that
89:50 - you're like I'm I refuse to do
89:52 - this I mean I mean personally I think
89:57 - carousels are just a huge waste of time
90:01 - and they don't work because no one never
90:03 - clicks to the second slide in the
90:05 - carousel but carousels basically exist
90:07 - so that you can tell the marketing
90:09 - higher ups that the content they wanted
90:12 - to put on the homepage is on the
90:13 - homepage it's just on slide seven um so
90:17 - I I consider Carousel is a little bit of
90:19 - a pattern that I would not I don't think
90:22 - anything that's like an anti- pattern
90:23 - but like a dark pattern like something
90:25 - that you think is like manipulative of
90:27 - users or maybe something that where
90:30 - there's like an ethical gray area oh
90:32 - like Adobe unsubscribing yeah or
90:35 - LinkedIn the the the uh master of dark
90:38 - patterns like hey would you like to tell
90:39 - your friends that that oh your friend's
90:42 - not LinkedIn would you like to like
90:43 - import your inbox and every single
90:45 - person you've ever like emailed and like
90:47 - send them an email say hey why aren't
90:48 - you on LinkedIn they did that like five
90:50 - times like they said they do it once and
90:52 - even the way they asked it was really
90:53 - sketchy anyway I don't want to hammer L
90:56 - too much but they they did so many
90:58 - sketch things to uh to build that out
90:59 - initially but but but you said AI uh
91:02 - Adobe like unsubscribe but are there any
91:04 - dark patterns that uh you you've like
91:07 - felt really bad about like implementing
91:08 - just because your boss told you to
91:10 - implement or is there anything that like
91:12 - an ethical line that you'll never cross
91:13 - again yeah I mean I was fortunate that I
91:17 - think I didn't have I was never asked to
91:18 - do something that I felt ethically like
91:20 - questionable about um but yeah I think
91:22 - anything that like leverages is like
91:25 - your real life information or personal
91:28 - information I think you know for social
91:31 - credit or whatever on the app is like
91:33 - something that I think I would never I
91:36 - would never want to do
91:38 - that um yeah anything that that tries to
91:41 - get you to import your entire like
91:43 - contact list from your phone to the and
91:46 - give all your personal data to the app
91:48 - is like I think pretty
91:50 - bad yeah 100% agreed um so in terms of
91:55 - like gradually you're somebody who
91:57 - focuses on expanding their skills all
91:59 - the time in terms of strategies you've
92:03 - used to like learn things like what is
92:06 - something that if if somebody wanted to
92:08 - learn an entire new area like let's say
92:10 - they're a front end developer and they
92:11 - want to learn backend so they can do
92:12 - full stack development like are there
92:13 - any particular strategies or advice that
92:15 - you would give to somebody that wanted
92:17 - to absorb an entire new you know Corpus
92:20 - of knowledge yeah I think if I was
92:23 - trying to to learn something new in
92:25 - programming I think I would definitely
92:27 - go to YouTube first I would go to
92:29 - YouTube and see what videos are kind of
92:31 - the most popular for for example a
92:34 - search term for like you know xyz4
92:37 - beginners um I think I'd also probably I
92:39 - would probably check out Reddit I think
92:40 - Reddit is a good source of like real
92:43 - information from like real people
92:46 - usually especially for like learning I
92:48 - think it's really good um because
92:49 - there's always going to be someone
92:50 - posting like I want to learn this and
92:52 - that like how do I get started and
92:54 - then people who are more ahead of you
92:56 - have like good recommendations I feel
92:58 - like um yeah so I think
93:02 - just I think learning how to just figure
93:06 - learning how to identify what a good
93:08 - resource is versus a not good resource I
93:10 - think is kind of important um yeah are
93:14 - there any like telltale signs uh what is
93:16 - going to be like my biggest concern is
93:18 - not necessarily the quality of the
93:19 - resource but like how much of the
93:21 - resource you're going to get before they
93:22 - slim a pay wall your face and like oh I
93:25 - just spent like half an hour learning
93:26 - this tutorial and suddenly like I can't
93:28 - Advance any further you know like pay
93:31 - walls are really annoying I understand
93:32 - that that you know code academy and
93:34 - websites like that have to keep the
93:35 - lights on uh but uh it's all like
93:39 - sometimes I wonder if they're not
93:40 - sufficiently forthcoming about what the
93:41 - course actually includes for free before
93:44 - you have to start like you know
93:45 - inputting your credit card but sure are
93:48 - there any um just just to re rephrase my
93:51 - questions this is a Meandering thing um
93:53 - are there are there any like telltale
93:55 - signs of like hey this is going to be
93:56 - too superficial like I shouldn't cuz you
93:59 - can watch the same you know C in 3
94:02 - minutes not to pick on because he does
94:04 - it inest Fire Ship does like ingest how
94:07 - C Works in three minutes there's not an
94:08 - expectation you're learn CP in 3 minutes
94:11 - but like you can watch the same like
94:13 - HTML explained for forgetters like 30
94:15 - minute tutorial like you can watch 20 of
94:18 - those and you wouldn't really be any
94:19 - better than if you just watched one or
94:21 - two of them right like uh how do you
94:23 - identify a a good
94:26 - resource um I personally I sort of look
94:29 - at the tone of how the information is
94:31 - conveyed so if someone starts the video
94:34 - like how to learn HTML and they're like
94:36 - what's up like I'm here to show you and
94:38 - it it feels a little bit too like um
94:41 - there's like a certain energy that like
94:43 - sort of makes me naturally distrust the
94:45 - person but so I feel like and this is
94:47 - again just maybe my own personal
94:48 - preferences but if I feel like the
94:50 - person teaching me something seems like
94:52 - they are more like serious or more it
94:56 - seems like they've really put time into
94:58 - explaining things well I think that's a
94:59 - good sign I think also you can look at a
95:01 - channel and this is just for YouTube
95:04 - resources but you know for example Kevin
95:07 - pal all his videos are about CSS they
95:10 - are incredibly in depth and I think
95:12 - people kind of recognize that over time
95:15 - um and they and he explains things
95:17 - really well and so I think that looking
95:21 - at sort of their body of work on their
95:23 - Channel and seeing how you know either
95:26 - shallow or how in-depth they go on the
95:28 - topics I think if you do a little bit of
95:31 - research and just kind
95:33 - of yeah see for yourself like how the
95:36 - teaching kind of sounds so I think yeah
95:39 - whether they're talking authoritatively
95:41 - or it looks like they're reading a
95:42 - script that was probably generated by
95:43 - gbt or something
95:45 - right yeah yeah uh and Kevin Powell the
95:49 - king of CSS he does not like it when I
95:50 - call him that but that is like the the
95:52 - moniker that he has uh he's given by the
95:56 - community yes uh last question what are
96:00 - some biggest what do you think the
96:02 - biggest misconceptions uh people have
96:05 - about learning the code when they're
96:06 - just watching a bunch of YouTube videos
96:08 - like what are some misconceptions that
96:11 - you want to just shoot down real quick
96:13 - to like reassure people no that's that's
96:14 - not how it really
96:17 - is I would say um you don't have to be
96:22 - on The Cutting Edge this might be an
96:24 - unpopular opinion but it is my opinion I
96:26 - don't operate on The Cutting Edge and I
96:28 - don't think you need to excuse me um I
96:32 - think like especially when it comes to
96:34 - content creators in programming like
96:36 - you're trying to make a video that gets
96:38 - views so people will always make videos
96:40 - on like the next you know new hottest
96:43 - technology out there or newest framework
96:45 - or whatever but the reality is a lot of
96:48 - companies are using jQuery or they're
96:51 - using Wordpress or you know they're not
96:54 - using like the newest CSS feature that's
96:56 - not like um supported by like the
97:00 - majority of browsers so I would say
97:02 - don't worry about learning the newest
97:05 - hottest thing right now I would say just
97:08 - stick to the basics especially if you're
97:09 - at the beginning of your Learning
97:10 - Journey and you can always learn newer
97:13 - things like later on CU if you learn the
97:15 - new things now they may or may not be
97:18 - hit the mainstream and then you'll have
97:20 - in some ways maybe wasted some time that
97:22 - you could have spent just kind of
97:24 - focusing on the basics so that's my
97:26 - biggest piece of advice yeah 100% that's
97:30 - a great note to end on Jessica it's been
97:32 - such a blast learning more about you
97:34 - learning from you I've got like 160
97:36 - lines of notes in my uh editor here I've
97:40 - learned a tremendous amount and uh it's
97:42 - just such an amazing blessing to have
97:45 - you in the developer Community creating
97:48 - tutorials focusing on delivering
97:50 - substance for the people right and and
97:53 - uh you know we're all excited about your
97:54 - your big course that you you're working
97:56 - on best of luck continuing progress on
97:58 - that and again I just want to emphasize
98:00 - like over the years you've contributed
98:02 - so many tutorials to the Freo Camp uh
98:06 - text based like publication got some
98:08 - video courses from you like I am always
98:11 - really really hyped up and really jazzed
98:13 - whenever Bo mentions oh yeah I heard
98:14 - from Jessica you know so so like thank
98:17 - you for everything you're doing for the
98:19 - community yeah hopefully I can do more
98:21 - once this course is done with but yeah
98:24 - yeah love the free code Camp
98:25 - Community absolutely well thanks again
98:28 - for just providing like a really cool
98:30 - like I guess model of someone who has
98:32 - gone out and uh blazed their own path
98:35 - and who has transitioned from working in
98:38 - a field that like basically just
98:39 - cratered um I mean you talk about like
98:43 - having to go work as a temp with a
98:44 - college degree it's it's not a position
98:46 - that I did that too I worked uh doing
98:50 - like their temp agencies in Oklahoma
98:52 - City and I did that that whole thing for
98:54 - for a few years and it was miserable uh
98:56 - but but being able to find a way out of
98:57 - that being able to build up a skill set
98:59 - being able to you know do have a choice
99:02 - whether you want to do freelance work or
99:04 - for or continue to work for previous
99:06 - employers or work for your your friends
99:08 - new employers and stuff like that or um
99:11 - just continue to create content on your
99:13 - own like having that level of agency
99:14 - that level of security that that uh
99:17 - being being the master of your own
99:19 - destiny I think it's incredibly
99:20 - inspiring and I love how you don't
99:22 - sugarcoat any of this and you don't seem
99:24 - to take any of this for granted you're
99:25 - out there getting things done and you're
99:27 - working just as hard as you were before
99:29 - so uh it's a huge source of inspiration
99:31 - for me awesome yeah thanks so much for
99:34 - having me on yeah well everybody until
99:37 - next week happy coding
