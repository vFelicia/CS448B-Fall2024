00:00 - My name is Robert Axelsen as I said, you can find me on most of things @robaxelson.
00:05 - I'm a software developer by day by profession. I learned to code mainly via freeCodeCamp
00:13 - The meetup we are at now is for freeCodeCamp.org
00:18 - And I also organized meetups: this meetup here and also Vienna Go, Go Line meet up and Vue Jazz Vienna
00:26 - And I really love being around open-source and
00:30 - developer geek community
00:32 - So I keep doing this because it's ultimately fun
00:35 - If you want to learn more about mine and Daniel's journey
00:39 - Going from learn to code and getting a first developer job
00:42 - You can go to my website and there's a link to our talk there
00:47 - Okay, so let's go straight into it the first obstacle that you might meet and to preface it
00:53 - These obstacles are mainly based on
00:56 - My own experience and talking to people
00:59 - Fellow co-students. This is by no means as of this talk an exhaustive list
01:04 - So, please feel free again in the questions section to ask. We'll leave room for questions after the talk
01:14 - So when you're dealing with time the time might be an issue because
01:18 - I think starting out. It's easy to think that oh, you know
01:21 - I'll put like three weeks into this and I really focus and
01:24 - Maybe I'll learn a lot and then you realize after three months that oh god. There's so much to learn so
01:29 - There's different ways that time can hit you in the face
01:33 - But I think there are some things to keep in mind to not get too overwhelmed or too impatient
01:40 - One thing is to accept that learning takes time. Yes. It doesn't take too long to learn the basics of programming
01:45 - That's one thing that I struggle with on the opposite of time was that I thought it would take
01:50 - both the mind of a genius
01:53 - You know
01:55 - What is it called, prodigy or
01:58 - a really really long time and math skills to learn to program, but I kept
02:04 - having to face that
02:06 - Myth or misconception and I gradually learned that no, it's easier to then I thought to learn the basics
02:13 - but once you have the basics, what you really need to focus on is
02:18 - repetition repetition and getting better and just doing a lot so
02:22 - Things will take time. But to get the basics and get up to speed
02:25 - It doesn't necessarily have to takes a long time, but just manage your expectations and that learning the code
02:31 - It's not something to do on a whim and you need to be ready to commit
02:36 - Maybe, you know several months a half a year a year
02:39 - Depending on what you want to get out of programming if you want to learn to code
02:43 - definitely think longer than two weeks
02:49 - In learning to code you can also get trapped into spending too much time on stuff that
02:55 - you might realize afterwards weren't giving you as much
02:58 - Or weren't as beneficial to you, so you should instead of forcing yourself to
03:06 - Stick with the course you found
03:09 - You should rather try different courses, different books, different learning formats and see what works for you
03:16 - and what some of the
03:19 - Combinations of resources and courses and curriculum and teachers etc. might speed up things for you,
03:25 - so don't be afraid to experiment
03:29 - Again realistic time frame. We already talked about
03:33 - It helps to form helpful habits
03:35 - so instead of sitting down and forcing yourself to learn for two hours
03:38 - if you have habits in place and routines where it's not an issue, it's not a struggle to get started.
03:44 - It makes it easier. It's not easy to form habits
03:46 - It takes commitment in the beginning, but once it's habits, it makes it it's a habit. It's much easier just to get going
03:55 - Doubt is one thing that you can be faced with
03:58 - I think especially when you're thinking about applying for jobs even when you've got your first job or
04:05 - When you've started study. Like I had a wall after like three four months of starting freeCodeCamp
04:08 - I was like god dammit. Can I really do this? There's so much left to learn.
04:15 - I loved eating success stories for breakfast I still do
04:19 - There's tons of success stories on freeCodeCamp, the Medium publication if you just google it online
04:25 - There's so much stuff out there. Just talk to people in the audience today
04:29 - And just remember that everyone started somewhere. So even the most, you know accomplished
04:35 - Developer out there or even the most accomplished speaker / persona and whatever pick your programming language stage
04:46 - Started somewhere some people yes started when they were almost starting to walk and were like four or five year olds
04:52 - But most people started later in life
04:54 - and there's tons of success stories of people starting when they were twenty thirty forty fifty
04:59 - there was recently a great article by Quincy Larson, the founder of freeCodeCamp on just that topic
05:06 - Even for experienced developers. Google is your best friend
05:08 - So if you're doubting how to do this, someone else probably have also asked the same question
05:13 - Can I really do what I was tasked to do right now or what I chose to create. So don't be afraid to Google
05:21 - all the time
05:23 - It only seems the haters, it depends a bit about on your family and your friends
05:27 - I've been blessed to not have so many people
05:30 - Questioning why I was learning to code or
05:33 - Why are you learning to code and stuff like this?
05:36 - but I know some people have that issue and it's not easy to just ignore them if they're important part of your life,
05:43 - but don't give their opinions too much value and
05:49 - yes, you can we have again success stories tons of stories here today of people that have dealt with doubt and still have overcome and
05:57 - managed to learn to code
06:00 - Resources. Mentioning this it ties into some of the other things we've discussed
06:06 - When you are faced with doubt or time constraints
06:10 - Also in the beginning but
06:12 - When you are hitting a wall and feeling like Oh freeCodeCamp
06:16 - is maybe not for me or you're doing another online course or you're reading a book and you're getting stuck
06:21 - Don't be afraid to question the resource that you are using to learn to code.
06:26 - I supplemented freeCodeCamp first with "Eloquent JavaScript", a book
06:30 - and then gradually more with Udemy video courses
06:35 - But just don't be afraid to experiment there's tons of free resources, there's tons of cheap courses
06:43 - So the main focus on how to deal with resources is don't be afraid to test out things and switch it up
06:49 - but on the other flipside
06:52 - Don't get too fragmented. Like there's the shiny object syndrome of course
06:57 - You might try to buy every new fancy course and think that that's going to be the "blue pill"
07:01 - that's gonna get you from A to B in two weeks doesn't work like that, but
07:08 - Find something that works for you, and when you find something stick with it
07:12 - It can also help to have a mentor. It's not always so easy to find.
07:16 - In absence of that, co-students can be in my experience really good to just meet regularly at meetups
07:23 - taking initiative to meet people for coffee and some talking about code, you know
07:28 - give each other feedback and to
07:31 - have this
07:33 - Social sort of pressure to when you meet someone the next time. Oh, I should have completed that JavaScript calculator
07:39 - Let me just do that before I meet them tomorrow
07:41 - And pair programming is worth trying if you haven't. There's a lot of online communities where you can meet people and pair program for a session.
07:49 - You can also meet people in real life
07:51 - Pair programming is sitting together with someone else and coding on the same thing on one screen normally
07:58 - Just to not bore you too much I took in a bonus point here
08:04 - An obstacle when learning to code can be vim. If you don't know what vim is, it's a code editor in the terminal
08:10 - It's been around since the beginning of unix times
08:13 - or not so long, but it's been around for a couple of decades
08:17 - and it's infamous for being hard to
08:21 - Exit out of so if you just open it up and you don't know how to exit out of it
08:25 - You probably will not figure out and you close your terminal
08:29 - But this is more of a joke than a real obstacle if you want to know how to exit vim, this is how you exit vim
08:38 - Just to have that included
08:47 - So you literally just do
08:50 - Escape to have the command section
08:53 - and then you have : q and exclamation mark
08:57 - but you might be normally fine without the exclamation mark
09:00 - It sounds simple but on the other hand, it sounds may be unnecessary when you just gonna exit something
09:07 - so
09:08 - Let's get back on track
09:10 - Distractions is another thing, as with anything in life, especially with the infamous Millennials and all the distractions we have these days
09:19 - it's easy to sit down and
09:21 - You were going to learn to code today and then two hours later
09:24 - You've been checking everything on YouTube and all the latest JavaScript news or whatever
09:31 - It's a bit tricky one because again for me what helps the most is
09:36 - I realized the one thing I haven't put here I'll mention that but its habits again.
09:40 - If you manage to do stuff for the right reasons and also
09:43 - form the habits that you need to have the routine that works for you
09:49 - Like every morning for 20 minutes
09:52 - At lunch or in the evening before you watch your favorite TV series or whatever
09:58 - That you just stick with some routines and follow them.
10:02 - I like really the routine of just sticking with freeCodeCamp and getting the  brownie points if I help people at freeCodeCamp.org
10:10 - Via the chat room you get brownie points when people thank you. I just kind of kept wanting that
10:16 - Statistics of my points to go up that was the motivating force
10:21 - One thing I didn't put up here is that it helps to... no, I got distracted. So I forgot what it was
10:28 - so we'll get back to that
10:30 - Again to the better resources, I think that's the theme of this talk now
10:35 - But if you get distracted it might be because the course is not the best fit for you
10:39 - Maybe you would do better reading a book for an hour than for following
10:45 - something video or maybe
10:47 - Tutorials where you get to do stuff as you go along is better for you and so on and also one thing
10:53 - Actually it is here, but just didn't realize the thing that I forgot is
10:57 - Work on your "why". So if you feel
11:00 - lacking motivation or being distracted too easily. It might be because you're lacking motivation you need to learn to code
11:06 - You might rethink why you're learning to code and if it's really the right thing for you now
11:11 - Maybe it's a better fit in a year to be honest something happened
11:14 - You're like, oh no I need to do this for other reasons, but if you don't either have the passion for programming code
11:20 - These kind of things or you have the right reason to do it, it will be harder
11:24 - It's just a fact so you can still do it. You just need to figure out how to work on that for you
11:30 - I've been blessed that I've been loving computer since I could
11:34 - walk and tap on
11:37 - Keyboards, I just didn't get into programming until recently
11:43 - We'll save the questions for after because we are filming so it's not so easy to take questions during the filming
11:51 - But just keep them if you had some
11:54 - Getting stuck again. We've covered this sort of and we've covered switching up
12:00 - one thing I want to focus on is that if you feel like
12:05 - You were committing to a course or a material and you're like, yeah, but I can't give up
12:10 - I'm so invested in this for whatever reason, it's fine. You can just stop
12:15 - Try something else and it might work you might even return to where you were because you learned something from a different perspective.
12:21 - I had that experience with "Eloquent JavaScript" reading that for several chapters
12:25 - And I got the same things that were explained in freeCodeCamp curriculum in a different way and it was like, "Aha!"
12:31 - Now I felt more equipped to tackle the course afterwards
12:36 - Debugging is a thing where it depends on what you're coding in.
12:41 - It depends a bit on you and how strict you are on debugging with debugging tools in the beginning or not
12:51 - There are different opinions on this. But whichever way you are debugging with your language with your set of tools
13:02 - It helps getting better at
13:04 - Figuring out why your code is not working right now
13:07 - Google, again as we talked about if you're doing front-end the chrome developer tools and getting better at breakpoints and
13:15 - debugging having debugger
13:17 - as a
13:19 - as
13:21 - Variable name or like a method that you hook into your JavaScript and it stops in the browser to give you the
13:27 - To stop in time where you are debugging and those kind of things help
13:32 - If you don't know much about this, and I've had problems coding look into debugging
13:36 - Just google it
13:39 - What helps for me sometimes, and there's been studies done on this, if you are coding and you feel stuck and this could be
13:44 - professionally or learning to code
13:46 - it might be good with the context switch where you just force yourself to be like but I'm in the middle of this
13:51 - I can make this work and then you're an hour later. I can make this work and you're like, okay stop
13:55 - Just take a break 10 to 15 minutes
13:58 - go for a walk, do something entirely different and you might be like
14:01 - but now and then you go back to it or just the fact that you had a break you go back and you look at
14:06 - It with fresh eyes, it very often helps
14:09 - Yeah, Google again
14:12 - Okay, so
14:14 - For one of the last points. I think it's the last
14:17 - obstacle we're going over today is
14:20 - Deflation you might be like Oh
14:23 - Goddamn it. I've I've been trying to learn to code for like one week three months half a year or more and you feel like
14:32 - Yeah, you need some motivation. You're like, maybe it's not for me or whatever
14:38 - In my experience it helps to go to meetups or to socialize with others that also are learning to code.
14:49 - Sometimes it might help to be proactive for me and I also know Daniel
14:53 - It helps to look at motivational talks and documentaries
14:58 - I love these kind of success stories again or seeing like how this you know, seven year old kid
15:04 - that was a programming prodigy
15:06 - got into college early and just conquered the world with his iOS apps and those kind of things
15:11 - and I'm like if he can do that, I can certainly get further in my course material, and stuff like this.
15:19 - Yeah, and ultimately your "why," so if you're if you're kind of stuck ask yourself
15:24 - Why am I doing this and maybe I try to do some self motivation
15:29 - cool
15:31 - Just to make this talk even more exciting. We're hiring at my company. I mentioned this before but we're still hiring
15:37 - a front-end / full stack developer.
15:41 - We're also looking for a back-end
15:42 - The profile for both is a bit a little bit more
15:46 - Experienced because yeah, that's the general gist
15:49 - Have a look or send us an email if you are interested, and if you feel you don't have enough experience
15:54 - Feel free to still approach me or send an email or look at the website. It might still be
16:01 - Worth a look for you
16:05 - Yeah, I worked there
16:08 - I do JavaScript front-end stuff with Vue.js mainly at the moment
16:13 - Cool, I think
16:18 - Yes, I think that was it
16:21 - before we end I want to reinforce and I'll
16:25 - follow this up with putting a
16:28 - repo in the comment sessions because I want this talk to be something that people can contribute to
16:34 - I realized giving this talk that there's a lot of repetitiveness and there's some stuff that I could maybe when I talking about it could
16:40 - want to add myself. If people have stuff they would like to add or
16:45 - Feel they can contribute with help on how to overcome obstacles
16:48 - You're free to help
16:50 - With this talk for the future. Thank you very much
16:54 - [applause]
