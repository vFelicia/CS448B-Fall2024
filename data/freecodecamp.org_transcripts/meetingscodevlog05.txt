00:00 - this week was focused on meetings i've
00:02 - just had a call with the client and i'm
00:04 - super happy
00:08 - [Music]
00:28 - i've also developed a few pens using
00:31 - flexbox and sauce
00:33 - i practice another ui elements using
00:36 - flexbox
00:38 - [Music]
01:31 - i just got disappointed because
01:37 - because great layout
01:38 - and it's not ready for production yet
01:42 - because it's not supported by the
01:43 - browsers
01:44 - uh so
01:48 - well let's keep it for a while
01:50 - maybe i will come back to it somewhere
01:52 - in the future
01:53 - because it's not able to be used without
01:55 - very much hacks yes
02:12 - so
02:50 - traveling here in spain you see
02:53 - how much you lose when you don't change
02:56 - something don't go out sit in one place
02:59 - and
03:00 - do not notice what's all around you
03:03 - the same as in programming when you stay
03:05 - in one language when you don't try
03:07 - another stuff when you don't try another
03:08 - framework
03:10 - you get stacked of it you feel safe but
03:13 - you don't don't get out of your comfort
03:15 - zone if you are frontend you cannot just
03:18 - only close yourself like oh i will do
03:20 - that pages and bootstrap and or
03:24 - in you know i will just only design or i
03:26 - will just only use
03:28 - um
03:29 - angularjs because i hate react
03:32 - it's like
03:34 - specializing in one is great
03:36 - but being aware of what's around you and
03:39 - trying new things
03:41 - is even better
03:43 - variety has its reason you cannot close
03:46 - yourself just only to one thing
03:48 - and stick to it it's the end of your
03:50 - life so the fact that
03:52 - today for example you are learning react
03:54 - doesn't mean that you're programming
03:56 - viago or
03:58 - throughout your life if you stick just
04:00 - into this one framework language and not
04:04 - try anything new by ears
04:08 - it's like getting old a bit because idea
04:12 - is
04:13 - such a fast pace branch that you have to
04:17 - be at least aware of what's going on
04:19 - and especially if you work on projects
04:22 - where later you can design or you're a
04:24 - team member who has an influence on
04:26 - choosing the framework the solution that
04:29 - you know the database whatever player
04:32 - it's like
04:33 - if you are not aware of what's around
04:35 - you and what's better for what
04:38 - then you
04:39 - choose and suggest your clients yeah
04:41 - well go for this you know framework go
04:43 - for this solution and you jump straight
04:46 - to it just only because you know it not
04:48 - just because it's the best one
04:52 - great that holiday season is almost
04:54 - finished because all of the meetup
04:56 - starts
04:58 - living again so this week i'm going to
05:00 - usb tech we are trying also to organize
05:03 - next from the malaga and another coffee
05:06 - end code meeting
05:07 - there are at least three kinds of
05:10 - meetings worth considering while
05:12 - learning to code
05:14 - number one
05:16 - meetups
05:18 - at this page meetup.com you can find
05:20 - local meetups
05:21 - that are being organized in your city
05:24 - or you know close to your city it's
05:26 - thursday today i'm going for the first
05:28 - unofficial uh meeting of yes we tech
05:30 - this season yes we take its focus on
05:32 - diversity and equality in tech
05:36 - shall we begin
05:40 - [Music]
05:44 - let's begin
05:46 - [Music]
05:52 - [Music]
06:03 - number two
06:04 - project meetings i love this book it's
06:06 - reworked by jason fried and th as they
06:09 - say
06:10 - meetings are toxic in this book they
06:13 - also give the quick simple rules how to
06:16 - you know deal with meetings this is the
06:18 - list set a timer when a drinks meeting
06:20 - is over period so you know to schedule
06:23 - amount of time that you really
06:25 - want to devote to the meeting it would
06:26 - be perfect invite as few people as
06:28 - possible
06:30 - and always have a clearer agenda begin
06:32 - with a specific problem
06:34 - meet at the side of the problem instead
06:37 - of a conference room point to real
06:39 - things and suggest real changes
06:41 - end with a solution and make someone
06:44 - responsible for implementing it meetings
06:46 - are like time stealers and when i meet
06:49 - with a client and to talk about the
06:51 - project i try firstly to prepare it and
06:54 - uh to to prepare the ground for it to
06:56 - send him some list of questions firstly
06:58 - and to discuss just only the doubts and
07:01 - you know some unexpected uh things that
07:03 - he hadn't mentioned so far i'm learning
07:06 - it i'm learning also it's how to
07:08 - schedule the meetings uh in order to
07:11 - be more productive with them and in
07:13 - order to get as much as possible from
07:15 - them
07:16 - [Music]
07:19 - i've just had a call with the client and
07:22 - i'm super happy and i want to share with
07:23 - you that why i want to share it is
07:25 - because it teaches another thing about
07:27 - being freelancer and developer the thing
07:30 - is that
07:32 - because of asking properly the questions
07:34 - because of
07:35 - clarifying the details because of making
07:37 - from the general concept something that
07:38 - is tangible
07:40 - we reached the solution that seems to be
07:42 - really really
07:43 - awesome and really interesting to to
07:46 - design connecting learning with
07:49 - working as a freelancer is
07:51 - seems to be a really nice solution
07:53 - because you have extra time for learning
07:55 - but also you know money to survive and
07:58 - uh it it gives you the real
08:02 - the real life experience i would suggest
08:04 - going for smaller projects and for for
08:07 - the tasks that you really
08:08 - feel
08:09 - you know at least comfortable with they
08:12 - should be challenging they should be
08:13 - challenging in order to make you grow in
08:15 - order to make you develop and in order
08:16 - to like their work and you know the
08:18 - projects to make them inspiring also for
08:20 - you this real life experience
08:23 - is like a real training before bigger
08:26 - projects and bigger jobs remember that
08:28 - you don't need permission to start
08:30 - coding to start designing to start
08:32 - freelancing and to start taking projects
08:34 - and to start you know working with
08:36 - clients being self-aware and being
08:38 - reliable you can really
08:40 - start doing it right now
08:43 - and the third type of meetings of topics
08:46 - so meetings with friends and meetings
08:48 - you know connected with your hobbies
08:50 - meetings connected with staying alive in
08:52 - other fields of life
08:54 - there are some myths about people who
08:56 - close themselves and you know in like in
08:58 - cabinet and
09:00 - eat shitty pizza and simply learn coding
09:04 - in order to stay focused but it's not a
09:06 - way for me to do it
09:08 - i need variety in order to stay
09:11 - motivated in order to learn
09:13 - coffee isn't the fuel of my coat
09:16 - variety is it's after 6 p.m and i'm
09:19 - going out to
09:23 - the next meeting this week
09:25 - and in order to
09:27 - use the time on my way
09:30 - i'll be listening
09:33 - to the podcasts
09:40 - i've just finished listening to
09:43 - the podcast to the last
09:45 - late night with travel noise about
09:48 - productivity
09:50 - and about self-awareness it's really
09:52 - worth recommending
09:57 - in order to stay motivated
10:00 - you cannot sit all the time in front of
10:02 - the screen you have to go out
10:08 - [Music]
10:11 - [Applause]
10:12 - [Music]
10:21 - we are trying to find the gift for our
10:22 - friends we are going for the meeting
10:23 - this will be more tonic and we are also
10:25 - presenting foreign
10:34 - thank you
10:41 - [Music]
10:52 - this week i took part in a few meetings

11:16 - next week i will have to put the
11:17 - priority to the new project that i'm
11:19 - starting it's connected with design but
