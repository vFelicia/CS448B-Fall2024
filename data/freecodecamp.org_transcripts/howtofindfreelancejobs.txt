00:08 - hi my name is luke sisliano and i'm a
00:10 - self-employed web developer i've done a
00:12 - few articles and videos for free code
00:14 - camp that relate to working for oneself
00:16 - as a freelancer
00:18 - i've decided to expand on those a little
00:20 - bit in this video and the article that's
00:22 - going along with it by really discussing
00:25 - what it even means to be a freelance
00:27 - developer in the first place and i'm
00:29 - also going to talk about how you can get
00:30 - business
00:32 - the first of those topics i think is
00:33 - really important to address because
00:36 - a lot of people aren't really even clear
00:38 - as to what it means to quote on quote
00:40 - unquote be a freelance developer so
00:42 - we're going to really discuss what that
00:44 - looks like and kind of what a more of an
00:47 - actual definition for it is and then
00:49 - we're like i said we're also going to
00:50 - look into how you can get customers in
00:53 - your business and we're going to look at
00:55 - two routes for that
00:56 - the first one being how you can get
00:58 - customers online through your own
00:59 - website and we're also going to look at
01:02 - how you can get customers uh locally in
01:04 - your city
01:05 - uh the one thing i want to do a little
01:07 - differently in this video
01:09 - is i don't want to throw out a lot of
01:12 - the general advice that you'll hear from
01:14 - a lot of resources as to
01:16 - how to get business there are a lot of
01:18 - ways to get business where you can make
01:20 - a few bucks but the approach i'm going
01:22 - to be taking and suggesting in
01:24 - this video and again the article that's
01:26 - going along with it
01:27 - is really meant for those that kind of
01:29 - want to take their business to the next
01:31 - level in other words they don't want to
01:32 - just make a few bucks they want to be
01:34 - really profitable and they want to do
01:36 - really well for themselves
01:39 - so we'll be discussing those tips as we
01:41 - go along but as i said
01:44 - in order in this video we're going to
01:45 - talk about what is freelancing we're
01:47 - going to talk about
01:49 - a list of items that you need to
01:51 - complete before you even
01:53 - think about reaching out to customers
01:54 - once you've decided to go to
01:57 - the freelance route we're going to talk
01:59 - about how you can get customers online
02:01 - and we're going to talk about where to
02:03 - get customers locally and how to get
02:04 - customers locally in your own city so
02:06 - all that said let's get to it
02:17 - okay so before we talk about how to get
02:19 - customers into your development business
02:22 - i think it's important to first kind of
02:23 - talk about what it even means to be a
02:25 - freelancer in the first place
02:27 - i think this is important because the
02:28 - word freelance has kind of become a
02:30 - buzzword that gets thrown around a lot
02:31 - in today's society right you'll hear
02:33 - people say i'm a freelance developer i'm
02:35 - a freelance writer a freelance writer
02:37 - i'm a freelance journalist i'm a
02:38 - freelance this or that or blah blah blah
02:41 - in other words because it's almost
02:43 - become kind of a buzzword it can tend to
02:45 - mean
02:46 - different things to different people you
02:47 - might have person one and person two and
02:50 - this person says i'm a freelancer and
02:52 - they mean it one way and this person
02:53 - essentially hears something else and
02:55 - they never really are on the same page
02:57 - as to what the
02:58 - person does so i'm gonna lay out a
03:00 - couple of actual definitions of what it
03:02 - means to be a freelance developer to
03:05 - answer that question of what is
03:06 - freelancing
03:07 - in the first place
03:09 - and
03:10 - the really comes down to two definitions
03:12 - the first one being
03:14 - the individual who is truly
03:15 - self-employed the second one being the
03:17 - individual who's doing it as a side
03:19 - hustle um let's look at the first of
03:21 - these two that i just mentioned
03:23 - if you're going to freelance route it
03:25 - can mean that you are truly
03:26 - self-employed and with that you are a
03:29 - one-person operation uh it's your first
03:32 - of all it's your sole job you don't have
03:33 - any other jobs that you work you know
03:34 - you don't have a full-time job and
03:36 - develop software on the side or anything
03:37 - like that you are a developer and you
03:40 - work for yourself and that's it you have
03:42 - no other income outside of your business
03:44 - and you are truly a one-person operation
03:47 - um you know not only do you do all the
03:49 - marketing and uh or i should say donald
03:52 - do you do all the dev work you do all
03:54 - your own marketing you do all your own
03:55 - bookkeeping you do all your own
03:57 - uh you know uh regulatory filings and
04:01 - things of that nature so you are a
04:03 - one-person operation you are the
04:05 - administrative side of things you are
04:07 - the uh business development side of
04:09 - things you are the
04:11 - actual uh dev work side of things you
04:13 - know that is you
04:15 - um
04:16 - going this route can result in
04:19 - much higher income than you tend to
04:21 - receive uh in a job for somebody if you
04:24 - really you know
04:25 - you know if you really decide to get
04:27 - behind your business and keep it get it
04:29 - going
04:31 - in my experience you can really make a
04:32 - lot more working for yourself than you
04:34 - can
04:34 - working for somebody else because you're
04:36 - keeping one hundred percent of what you
04:38 - bail out right instead of somebody else
04:40 - billing out your labor and then taking a
04:42 - percentage of it you're keeping 100
04:43 - percent of your you know what's built
04:45 - for your own labor so you know if you
04:47 - really put your nose to the grindstone
04:48 - you can
04:50 - uh make a lot more money going the
04:52 - self-employed route
04:54 - self-employed slash freelance route than
04:56 - you can working for somebody else
04:59 - the one thing to understand about this
05:00 - though is that going that
05:02 - self-employment route is
05:05 - going to result in a less stable income
05:07 - when you're working a job for somebody
05:08 - you have the security of a paycheck
05:10 - whereas you know when you're working for
05:12 - yourself you might have a big month you
05:13 - might have a bad month you might have a
05:14 - mediocre month your income's going to be
05:17 - all over the place uh you know you have
05:19 - to worry about clients paying you on
05:20 - time you have to worry about getting
05:21 - clients you have to worry about how slow
05:23 - is your business how busy is your
05:24 - business
05:25 - um things of that nature so your income
05:27 - is really going to go
05:28 - up and down in you know like a really
05:31 - big way so you've really got to think
05:33 - about um the fact that if you're going
05:35 - to go the self-employment route that
05:38 - you're going to have less stable income
05:40 - than you would
05:41 - working a job even though you have the
05:43 - potential to in aggregate make more
05:45 - money you know like at the end of every
05:48 - year
05:48 - the other thing
05:50 - excuse me and the other thing about you
05:53 - know going the truly independent route
05:56 - is that you're going to be putting in a
05:59 - lot of hours um because again you've got
06:01 - to do all the dev work you've got to do
06:04 - all the marketing you've got to do all
06:05 - the bookkeeping and you've got to do all
06:07 - of the
06:08 - name 10 other things you know that i
06:11 - haven't listed yet so
06:13 - you know it's easy to work full time as
06:15 - a dev without having to do all that
06:17 - stuff so if you're going to be doing all
06:18 - that stuff as well it means you're going
06:20 - to be working a lot of hours
06:22 - now even though you're working a lot of
06:24 - hours one of the upsides of this is you
06:26 - tend to get a lot of flexibility where
06:28 - you work right
06:30 - you know you can take a vacation and get
06:32 - work done while you're on vacation
06:34 - you can travel and you know like work
06:36 - while you're traveling if you you know
06:38 - uh you know if you kind of want to just
06:40 - become a traveling nomad and code all
06:43 - over the place you can potentially even
06:44 - do that
06:46 - so it really gives a lot of flexibility
06:48 - into how you live your personal
06:50 - lifestyle um
06:52 - the reason
06:54 - uh i keep talking about this in the
06:55 - context of self-employment and you doing
06:57 - everything
06:58 - is that
07:00 - going this uh individual route
07:04 - does not involve you having any
07:05 - employees okay
07:07 - once you start hiring employees you're
07:09 - not a freelancer you're a business owner
07:11 - at that point so
07:13 - you know i really define being a
07:14 - freelancer as a self-employed one-person
07:18 - operation and again once you start
07:20 - hiring employees you're not a freelancer
07:21 - anymore you're a business owner you're
07:22 - responsible for people and
07:24 - you know things of that nature um you
07:27 - know yeah uh you know you have to work
07:30 - more uh because you have to make sure
07:31 - the revenue is coming in to you know pay
07:33 - people um you know like etc etc so
07:38 - that kind of spells out what it is to be
07:41 - kind of that one person self-employed
07:44 - operation
07:45 - and calling yourself a freelancer um
07:48 - you know another option though where
07:50 - people can probably call them fairly
07:52 - call themselves a freelancer is when
07:55 - it's more your side hustle right
07:58 - in other words you have a full-time job
07:59 - somewhere or some kind of full-time
08:01 - business or career somewhere and you're
08:03 - doing development work on the side
08:05 - this could be for example you know like
08:07 - you're
08:08 - working a dev job somewhere and you uh
08:12 - you know start building websites for
08:13 - people on the side just as one example
08:16 - but you keep your full-time job or you
08:18 - know maybe you've got a full-time job
08:19 - that's completely unrelated to software
08:21 - development and uh you know you're
08:23 - finishing up free code camp and you want
08:24 - to just do some work on the site as a
08:26 - part-time project again you keep your
08:28 - full-time job but you're
08:29 - doing you know your dev work you know
08:32 - like on the side uh that would be
08:34 - another definition that i would assign
08:36 - to the word you know like freelance
08:38 - developer
08:41 - so the one thing about this approach
08:43 - is
08:44 - you're
08:45 - you're working two jobs right
08:47 - because you're working your full-time
08:48 - job and you have your business on the
08:50 - side and that means you are working a
08:53 - lot of hours i mean a lot because you
08:55 - have a full-time job
08:57 - and now you've got a business that you
08:58 - know you've got to run a part-time
09:00 - business that you've got to run you know
09:02 - like on the side of that so it means a
09:04 - lot of times you're going to be working
09:06 - on client projects at night you're going
09:07 - to be working you know like on client
09:09 - projects on the weekends it really tends
09:11 - to mean that friday is only two more
09:13 - working days until monday so if you know
09:16 - if you're going to go that route of
09:18 - making it a part-time business while you
09:19 - have a full-time job understand you are
09:20 - going to be working a lot of hours
09:23 - uh
09:24 - upsides and downsides of this approach
09:26 - are that it can result in more stable
09:28 - income for you because you know like as
09:30 - i said a minute ago people who truly
09:32 - work for themselves only uh you know
09:36 - kind of good months and bad months and
09:37 - their income can be all over the place
09:38 - well if you have a job somewhere then
09:41 - that means you have a steady paycheck
09:42 - right so you know you've got the
09:43 - steadiness of the paycheck
09:45 - but you also have a lot less upside
09:47 - potential because again you can make
09:50 - more working for yourself and you're
09:52 - just choosing to devote a lot of time to
09:53 - working for somebody else so the amount
09:55 - of money your business can bring in is
09:57 - going to be limited again because you're
09:58 - just doing this as you know like a side
10:01 - hustle
10:02 - so
10:02 - you know which one's right you know
10:04 - going the whole self-employment route or
10:07 - go in the side hustle route that really
10:09 - depends on you it depends on your you
10:10 - know your personal choices your personal
10:12 - preferences your personal situation and
10:15 - just kind of what it is you want out of
10:16 - life more than anything else so
10:18 - there's nothing right or wrong you know
10:20 - with either of those approaches you just
10:22 - gotta pick um which one's right for you
10:25 - but if you are gonna think of yourself
10:26 - as a quote-unquote freelance developer
10:29 - you my suggestion would be either a say
10:32 - i'm self-employed and i'm going to make
10:35 - this a full-time thing and i am going to
10:37 - work really hard at it i'm really going
10:39 - to try and grow it
10:41 - and the second approach would be hey
10:43 - this is a side hustle and i'm gonna keep
10:46 - my main job and whichever one of those
10:48 - is right for you hey rock on man um
10:51 - so again with all that said that's kind
10:54 - of how i define
10:55 - freelancing in one of those two terms uh
10:59 - you know
11:01 - you know you can pick which one's right
11:03 - for you
11:04 - so
11:05 - with all that said uh in a minute we're
11:07 - going to talk about uh how to get
11:09 - customers online and how to get
11:11 - customers in your own locale but before
11:13 - we do that i think it's really important
11:15 - that we lay out some things you need to
11:16 - get done in your business
11:18 - before you even try to get a customer at
11:21 - all okay in other words before you start
11:22 - proactively marketing yourselves to
11:25 - anyone so let's take a look at that
11:36 - okay before we talk about how you're
11:38 - going to go out and get new customers
11:40 - for your business
11:41 - we need to talk about a few things that
11:42 - you need to nail down inside your
11:44 - business uh before you even start
11:46 - marketing yourself to new people that
11:47 - haven't found you yet and the reason i
11:50 - say you need to nail these things down
11:52 - from the get-go is because it's all
11:54 - about getting your business off on the
11:56 - right foot correct um if you start off
11:59 - on the wrong foot
12:00 - then as you start getting busy it's only
12:02 - going to get harder to go back and
12:04 - correct these things so the time to make
12:07 - sure you've got all your ducks in a row
12:08 - is from the beginning not something you
12:10 - do
12:11 - later on so two things you need to nail
12:13 - down
12:14 - before you even go out and try to market
12:17 - yourself to someone who hasn't heard of
12:19 - you yet is one
12:21 - setting up your company around the idea
12:23 - that you're going to exit or you're
12:25 - going to service your existing customers
12:27 - first and try to get new customers
12:30 - second i'll explain why this is in a
12:32 - minute the second thing you're going to
12:33 - do is get all your branding set up your
12:35 - website review profiles things of that
12:37 - nature and i'm going to give you an
12:38 - action item list for those
12:40 - in just a minute so let's talk about
12:43 - each of these in turn
12:44 - the
12:46 - most important part
12:48 - of how you're going to get customers in
12:50 - the future
12:51 - is to focus on your existing customers
12:54 - first in other words focus on your
12:56 - existing customers first
12:58 - and market second and like i said before
13:01 - you even try to meet anybody else you
13:02 - got to make sure your business is
13:04 - set up around this concept so
13:08 - why do i say it is crucial to set up
13:12 - your business around the idea of
13:13 - focusing on existing customers first and
13:15 - servicing existing customers first
13:17 - um
13:18 - well let me explain this a little
13:20 - indirectly
13:21 - if you talk to not just and not just
13:24 - developers if you talk to just business
13:25 - owners in general and you ask them hey
13:27 - what do you need to do to grow your
13:28 - business the first thing they need
13:30 - they'll almost always universally say is
13:33 - they need to market more they need to
13:34 - advertise more they need to do more
13:36 - things to get people who have never
13:38 - heard of them calling and that usually
13:40 - involves some kind of paid advertising
13:42 - going to networking events and you know
13:44 - and all that kind of stuff
13:46 - um well think of it like this
13:50 - every dollar or every you know every bit
13:52 - of time you put into
13:54 - dealing with advertising every bit of
13:56 - time you put into
13:58 - uh going to networking events
14:01 - that's money and time you're not putting
14:03 - into
14:04 - uh existing
14:05 - customers that you already have working
14:07 - for you that means those existing
14:09 - customers are going to wait a little
14:10 - longer to get the product that you're
14:12 - supposed to be working on for them it
14:14 - means those existing customers aren't
14:15 - having as good an experience as
14:18 - they would otherwise have and then they
14:20 - become less likely to refer somebody to
14:22 - you in the future they become less
14:24 - likely
14:25 - to
14:26 - give you a review
14:29 - be someone who gives you a review i
14:30 - should say
14:32 - this puts you in a position
14:34 - of having to reach a new customer every
14:36 - time you want to get new business so in
14:38 - other words you know if you want to have
14:40 - four new customers your marketing would
14:42 - need to reach
14:43 - four people four separate people who
14:45 - have never heard of you
14:47 - at all
14:49 - think of how resource intensive this is
14:51 - you know to go out and reach four people
14:54 - you've got to do enough advertising to
14:55 - reach four separate people uh if you're
14:58 - doing it through networking events
14:59 - you've got to go to enough networking
15:00 - events to meet you know like four
15:02 - separate potential clients it is
15:04 - incredibly resource intensive
15:06 - to run a business that is entirely
15:08 - reliant on customers who have otherwise
15:11 - never heard of you as opposed to
15:13 - customers who are referred to you by
15:15 - somebody who has already heard of you
15:17 - okay
15:19 - so
15:20 - i've this is something i've gone around
15:22 - around with businesses
15:25 - about for years
15:26 - and a lot of people just to be frank
15:28 - don't get it and they wonder why they
15:31 - struggle
15:32 - um
15:33 - you know
15:34 - if you focus on those existing customers
15:36 - first
15:37 - what you could do instead of that
15:39 - resource intensive approach i just
15:40 - described is
15:42 - you can get one lead and then turn that
15:45 - lead into several new clients and
15:47 - several jobs without putting any more
15:48 - resources into getting leads so
15:52 - i have several personal examples of this
15:54 - i'll just share one with you in 2013
15:58 - i uh i built a website for a lawyer
16:03 - that lawyer was you know i focused on it
16:05 - you know got it out the door
16:07 - that lawyer was really happy with my
16:09 - services
16:11 - uh
16:12 - relatively short amount of time later
16:14 - doesn't matter relatively short amount
16:15 - of time later that lawyer called me had
16:18 - me build a second website for her law
16:20 - firm
16:21 - on a new kind of about a new niche area
16:23 - of law that she was going to be
16:25 - practicing so she was going to have two
16:26 - websites so that one phone call became
16:29 - two jobs because she was happy with my
16:31 - services and became a repeat customer
16:34 - she has since then referred me to more
16:36 - people
16:37 - and one of those people have hired me
16:40 - and and so in addition to
16:43 - that one phone call
16:45 - turning into three different products
16:46 - i've built
16:48 - i am also performing on i also have a
16:50 - performing uh or a contract for
16:52 - performing on ongoing maintenance with
16:54 - the lawyer
16:56 - and i have a contract for performing
16:58 - ongoing maintenance with the person that
17:00 - the lawyer referred to me so one phone
17:02 - call
17:03 - turned into three separate jobs and two
17:06 - ongoing maintenance contracts okay
17:09 - think of that versus
17:12 - you know if you wanna do three projects
17:14 - you gotta go out and get three separate
17:16 - leads it is much much better to service
17:19 - your existing customers first and let
17:22 - those existing customers turn into
17:23 - resources whenever you see a developer
17:26 - who
17:27 - makes twice as much as somebody else so
17:29 - in other words if developer one makes
17:30 - twice as much money as developer two
17:33 - it's not because developer one is
17:34 - getting twice as many phone calls
17:37 - um from people that wouldn't have
17:38 - otherwise heard of them uh they're
17:40 - getting more phone calls but they're
17:42 - also getting a lot of referrals they're
17:43 - getting a lot of repeat business and
17:44 - things of that nature you cannot grow
17:47 - your business
17:48 - at any kind of decent rate
17:50 - without referrals without repeat
17:51 - business you cannot do it and you get
17:54 - those referrals in that repeat business
17:56 - by focusing on your existing customers
17:58 - first
17:59 - so
18:00 - what focusing on your existing customers
18:02 - first means is if there is something
18:05 - that you could be doing
18:07 - for an existing customer
18:10 - do it okay
18:11 - and if you have time left over at the
18:13 - end then that time goes into marketing
18:15 - so let's say for example
18:17 - you've dedicated yourself to saying hey
18:19 - i'm going to work 45 hours a week in my
18:21 - business okay
18:23 - and then your dev work for the week and
18:25 - customer service for the week takes up
18:27 - 30 hours okay and so
18:29 - you've worked 30 hours you have 15 more
18:31 - to work but you don't really have
18:32 - anything else you can be doing for
18:33 - clients right now
18:35 - then you devote that other 15 hours into
18:38 - going out and trying to get new
18:39 - customers but focus on your existing
18:41 - customers first and you will actually
18:44 - find yourself working smarter not harder
18:46 - and your business will grow you know
18:48 - like exponentially as a result of that
18:50 - so thing number one to do
18:53 - when getting ready to start up your
18:55 - freelance business before even trying to
18:57 - get a customer understand that you need
19:00 - to service existing customers first
19:02 - the second thing you need to do
19:05 - before even attempting to go out and get
19:07 - customers is establish your branding
19:10 - okay and by your branding i mean things
19:12 - like your website your portfolio will
19:14 - work and things of that nature
19:16 - the reason why you need to have your
19:18 - branding set up before you even try to
19:19 - get customers it's pretty simple right
19:22 - put yourself in the shoes of someone
19:25 - that you're hoping will hire you like
19:27 - let's say you're talking to
19:29 - you know um a local local auto shop um
19:33 - asking uh you know and you're hoping
19:35 - that you can
19:36 - you know build a website or an app for
19:38 - them or something
19:40 - and you know you don't have a website of
19:42 - your own
19:43 - you don't have a portfolio work to show
19:45 - them
19:46 - you you know don't have
19:48 - any online reviews or anything of that
19:50 - nature
19:51 - what are the chances they're going to
19:52 - take you seriously slim to none right so
19:56 - what you'll wind up doing is spending a
19:57 - lot of time
20:00 - trying to get that first lead even
20:01 - though you know
20:03 - even though you could have gotten that
20:04 - first lead with a lot less effort if you
20:06 - had done like all those things in
20:07 - advance so
20:09 - first part of branding yourself is to
20:12 - get a portfolio website up uh and when i
20:15 - say a portfolio website i mean a website
20:16 - that shows what you do
20:18 - and uh you know some stuff you've built
20:21 - you can build out your own or if you're
20:23 - looking for inspiration a really good
20:24 - resource for uh to go to uh for your
20:27 - website would be html5 up uh we're gonna
20:30 - link to them in the description below uh
20:33 - you know if you use a free template from
20:35 - html5 up just make sure that uh you know
20:38 - you're following their licensing
20:40 - requirements and giving attribution you
20:41 - know like we're required and uh things
20:43 - like that they have paid templates you
20:45 - know like you can use um as well but so
20:48 - getting your website up is number one
20:50 - including a portfolio in that website is
20:52 - really crucial
20:54 - if you have not done a lot of things yet
20:58 - or haven't done a lot of projects yet
21:00 - you can still include a portfolio that
21:03 - targets your market
21:05 - on your website
21:06 - so let's just say for example and again
21:09 - i'm using simple examples
21:11 - let's say
21:12 - your niche is going to be hey i want to
21:14 - build uh you know websites and apps for
21:17 - small local businesses okay
21:20 - so what you can do is
21:22 - put together
21:24 - essentially uh mock-up websites
21:27 - that would fit local businesses so like
21:29 - let's say for example you know you want
21:30 - to go around and introduce yourself to
21:32 - local restaurants well
21:34 - you know
21:35 - put together a restaurant website for
21:37 - you know a mythical restaurant and put
21:39 - it in your portfolio
21:42 - you know put together something for
21:44 - professional services businesses like
21:46 - law firms psychologists things like that
21:48 - and
21:49 - again a fictional mock-up and put that
21:51 - in your portfolio you can put five or
21:53 - six projects
21:55 - in your portfolio that would be examples
21:57 - of the types of local businesses you're
21:58 - going to be
22:00 - going out you know like in targeting so
22:01 - you can have a portfolio saying for
22:04 - example if you walked into a
22:05 - psychologist's office and you had a
22:06 - psychology website on your
22:08 - uh you know on your portfolio you could
22:10 - walk into a psychologist's office and
22:12 - explain here's what your website could
22:13 - look like i have you know a mock-up of
22:15 - this so putting together a portfolio
22:18 - into your website is crucial because
22:20 - again no one's going to take you
22:21 - seriously if you have a website of your
22:23 - own and
22:24 - you don't have a body of work to show
22:27 - and it may sound like duh when i say you
22:29 - have to have a website but you would be
22:31 - surprised at what a lot of other people
22:33 - do
22:35 - the other thing after you've
22:38 - put together your website and your
22:39 - portfolio is you need to set up your
22:41 - online review profiles um so for example
22:44 - go to google my business and set up a
22:46 - profile for your new for your new
22:48 - company uh go to facebook and set up a
22:50 - facebook page for your new company those
22:52 - would be the two big ones that i would
22:54 - suggest and whenever a customer is
22:58 - happy with you make sure you're asking
22:59 - the customer to you know like leave you
23:01 - a review
23:03 - as you get more reviews online more
23:04 - people will be willing to hire you you
23:07 - want to get those review profiles set up
23:09 - you know like like from day one so
23:11 - you're in a position to ask people for
23:13 - reviews um it's kind of hard to call
23:16 - somebody and say hey would you mind
23:17 - leaving me a review online when you
23:18 - don't even have the profiles to send
23:19 - them to yet right so get those set up
23:22 - you know like from day one
23:23 - the last thing you need to do before
23:26 - even attempting to go out and get a new
23:28 - customer is uh get get a business card
23:31 - for yourself and get a business phone
23:33 - number so people aren't just calling
23:34 - your personal cell phone business cards
23:36 - can be gotten pretty cheaply from a
23:38 - service like vistaprint and i mean i
23:41 - would just do kind of a basic option and
23:43 - then in terms of a business phone number
23:46 - you could use a free service like google
23:47 - voice it'll just go straight to your
23:48 - cell phone but then you have a dedicated
23:51 - line you know like for your business
23:52 - phone
23:55 - so those are the things i would really
23:57 - do in terms of setting up your branding
24:00 - so you know just again
24:03 - quick to quickly recap
24:05 - before you even attempt to go out and
24:07 - get a get a customer um meaning someone
24:10 - who hasn't heard of you yet number one
24:12 - understand and structure your business
24:14 - in a way
24:15 - that is focused on i'm gonna service
24:19 - existing customers first
24:21 - number two is establish your branding
24:23 - and branding is things like website
24:26 - portfolio online review profiles
24:29 - business cards and business phone number
24:32 - okay
24:33 - so once you get all those things out of
24:34 - the way you are then in a position to go
24:37 - out and uh
24:39 - start trying to get customers and start
24:41 - establishing a customer base in terms of
24:43 - getting customers online and getting
24:46 - customers locally
24:47 - in your city so with all that said let's
24:51 - you know let's talk about how to
24:53 - get customers online especially since
24:55 - you will have now created your own
24:57 - website as part of your branding
25:08 - okay so let's talk about how you can get
25:09 - customers online as an as a freelance
25:12 - developer
25:13 - now if you go back to the start of this
25:15 - video you remember i said that i was
25:17 - going to be focusing on
25:18 - concepts that are really meant to take
25:20 - your business to like kind of like that
25:22 - next level so
25:24 - in this video i'm not going to talk
25:26 - about places where you can get customers
25:28 - online uh you know essentially through
25:31 - like third-party hiring sites instead
25:33 - what i'm going to talk about is how to
25:35 - build up your web presence in a way that
25:37 - is going it's going to
25:40 - bring you customers on a regular basis
25:43 - building up your web presence in a way
25:45 - that is profitable for your business
25:48 - revolves around a couple of concepts
25:52 - number one is going to be invest in your
25:54 - web presence don't spend on it this is
25:56 - really crucial i'll explain what
25:58 - this is in a minute
26:00 - number two is
26:02 - optimizing your website for
26:05 - a few niche areas in your local market
26:08 - okay and i'll explain why this is in a
26:12 - minute uh
26:13 - but before we get to optimizing your
26:15 - website let's go back to the first one
26:16 - which is investing in your web presence
26:18 - instead of spending on it
26:20 - here is the difference when you invest
26:23 - in something you own it when you spend
26:25 - money on something you're renting it so
26:28 - an example of spending would be
26:30 - you build a website for your business
26:32 - you put your portfolio in it looks
26:34 - really nice and to get customers in your
26:36 - market to see your website you like do
26:39 - paid ads for google paid ads through
26:41 - facebook
26:42 - things like that you're renting ad space
26:44 - from a third party you're spending money
26:47 - on ads because you don't own anything at
26:49 - the end of the day right
26:51 - well you can make money doing that so
26:54 - let's say you spend a thousand bucks on
26:55 - ads this month let's say it brings ten
26:57 - thousand bucks in business into your
26:58 - bank account it's easy to look at that
27:00 - and go score
27:02 - the problem with that is that thousand
27:04 - dollars is gone it's never going to
27:05 - bring you another dime okay it's um you
27:08 - spent a thousand got 10 but that's it
27:10 - and next month if you don't spend money
27:12 - again your revenue goes from 10 000 to
27:14 - zero so you get locked into spending you
27:17 - know
27:18 - essentially spending money on ads on
27:20 - just you know a perpetual basis and it
27:23 - can get
27:24 - really hard to get out of that trap
27:27 - now
27:28 - if you invest in your business you can
27:30 - put some time and resources into
27:32 - something once but then it keeps paying
27:34 - you a dividend forever because you own
27:35 - it so investing is when you own
27:37 - something an example of owning something
27:39 - would be creating a blog post for
27:42 - your website that is meant to reach your
27:44 - target audience in organic search it
27:46 - could mean doing youtube videos that
27:50 - your
27:51 - target audience may see organically like
27:54 - things of that nature and that can have
27:57 - a much better result for your business
28:00 - when you go that ownership route and
28:03 - investment route versus spending and
28:04 - renting okay
28:06 - um
28:07 - so just to give you a personal example
28:10 - uh my previous brand uh was was acquired
28:14 - earlier this year in 2020
28:16 - something i'm quite happy about
28:18 - obviously
28:20 - so over the years i'd written roughly
28:24 - 400 articles
28:26 - on that for that brand
28:27 - um you know again reaching out to like
28:30 - my target market
28:32 - uh
28:33 - and
28:34 - a lot of those articles got a lot of
28:35 - traffic people called me because of them
28:37 - when i wrote an article it was on my
28:39 - blog forever i never had to do anything
28:41 - else with that article right so as
28:44 - opposed to an ad
28:46 - where the ad goes i pay for an ad it
28:48 - goes up but once it gets clicked on it's
28:49 - gone unless i pay again if i put time
28:52 - into writing an article it's there
28:53 - forever and it can keep on giving a
28:55 - return it doesn't have an expiration
28:57 - date on it okay
28:58 - so there was one article the top perform
29:01 - there a lot of my articles performed
29:02 - well
29:03 - but the top performing article on that
29:05 - blog got roughly call it ten thousand
29:07 - clicks um over a seven several year
29:10 - period so you know
29:13 - clicks and organic search without paid
29:14 - ads
29:15 - um
29:16 - if i had been doing paid advertising i
29:19 - probably would have spent
29:21 - somewhere in the area of let's say 10
29:23 - bucks a click okay
29:25 - so to get ten thousand clicks from
29:27 - potential customers would cost me a
29:29 - hundred thousand dollars it's a lot of
29:31 - money right
29:32 - that article that got the ten thousand
29:35 - clicks
29:36 - uh between researching it and writing it
29:38 - took me less than i want to say less
29:40 - than 10 hours to do it
29:43 - so i got the equivalent of a hundred
29:45 - thousand dollars worth of advertising
29:48 - for
29:49 - less than 10 hours of work
29:52 - now obviously that post was a home run
29:53 - they're not all going to be like that
29:54 - but you can see as you keep building up
29:56 - posts on your blog as you keep building
29:58 - up videos think of how that compounds
30:01 - over time so if you invest in things
30:04 - like blog post videos and other content
30:06 - that you're going to own as opposed to
30:09 - renting ad space
30:10 - you can really increase your
30:12 - profitability real fast and more people
30:14 - will find you without you having to
30:16 - spend a lot of time and money to do it
30:19 - my pr my prior brand that was just
30:21 - acquired
30:22 - the
30:23 - i started it in 2013 i sold it in 2020 i
30:28 - spent zero dollars in advertising the
30:31 - entire time you know like i had that
30:33 - brand okay it was all just investment in
30:35 - video it was uh you know mostly in blog
30:38 - writing but also uh you know like some
30:40 - videos i did on youtube interviews i
30:42 - gave you know like and some other things
30:45 - but i did not spend any money marketing
30:47 - that business at all so build up your
30:50 - business and your web presence in a way
30:52 - where you're investing in it and again
30:54 - investment means you own it if you put a
30:56 - blog post on your website you own it no
30:58 - one can take it from you if you put a
30:59 - video up on youtube you own it okay no
31:02 - one can take it from you do that as
31:04 - opposed to spending which means
31:06 - essentially running ad space
31:07 - from third party so rule number one
31:09 - invest in your web presence don't spend
31:11 - on it
31:14 - once you're doing that it comes to well
31:16 - what's my web presence going to look
31:18 - like and you really want to optimize
31:20 - your web presence for
31:22 - a few services in your local market okay
31:26 - so in other words your website may not
31:27 - even really hold out everything you do
31:31 - and it may not just talk about
31:34 - all the geographies you service
31:36 - and that's fine okay
31:38 - the reason i say that's fine is best
31:40 - explained by looking at what other
31:42 - developers do or i should say a lot of
31:44 - developers do which i consider to be
31:46 - quite wrong okay
31:47 - um
31:49 - you'll find a lot of freelance
31:50 - developers that have you know like a
31:52 - general website for themselves it says
31:54 - hey you know i build stuff for the web
31:56 - or i'm a web developer
31:58 - and kind of like a broad term um
32:01 - they'll list a bunch of languages and
32:03 - frameworks that you know they're
32:05 - familiar with um
32:07 - they might say where they're located but
32:08 - they don't really say i service these
32:11 - areas in other words you know they're
32:12 - not targeting a particular geography
32:16 - so
32:17 - you know if you're a consumer of
32:18 - services and you look at their website
32:21 - it's not really
32:23 - clear what niche they serve if any what
32:26 - services
32:27 - they offer
32:28 - it's kind of broad
32:30 - you're not sure if they work with people
32:32 - in your area or not um
32:35 - and
32:36 - so you may be might be less likely to
32:38 - call that person as a consumer the other
32:40 - thing is think of that competition think
32:42 - of the competition if you're a freelance
32:44 - developer and you've got a website
32:46 - that just says you know i can build
32:48 - pretty much anything for anyone anywhere
32:51 - then you are potentially or essentially
32:55 - i should say competing against every
32:57 - other developer out there uh good luck
32:59 - doing well in search results with that
33:01 - uh number one and number two even if you
33:04 - can get your site doing well in search
33:05 - on that on that broad of a level you are
33:08 - really like i said competing with the
33:10 - whole world you know like essentially
33:13 - so it is much better
33:16 - to reach
33:18 - a large number of people
33:21 - advertising some of what you do than it
33:24 - is to reach no people
33:26 - advertising
33:28 - all of what you do right
33:30 - so in other words uh
33:32 - in other words
33:34 - what i would suggest doing is focus your
33:35 - website on your local market
33:38 - and you know really just narrow down and
33:42 - you know make your website really
33:43 - emphasize
33:45 - a few of your services
33:46 - so like for example i live in ohio
33:50 - my website really focuses on
33:52 - you know
33:53 - ohio and all the cities you know like
33:56 - they're in it
33:57 - and it really only discusses a few of
33:59 - the services i can provide to people i
34:01 - can provide things other than those
34:03 - services but i just don't really get
34:04 - into them that much you know like on my
34:06 - website
34:07 - and as a result of that
34:09 - if you for example go to google and
34:11 - google you know do a search for ohio
34:13 - website design my site actually like
34:15 - comes up first in
34:16 - uh the organic results and that is
34:20 - really important because you would be
34:22 - surprised at
34:24 - just how many people
34:26 - uh are looking for a developer that's
34:28 - close to them a lot of my clients and i
34:30 - do mean a lot of my clients
34:32 - you know
34:33 - again that you could call a developer in
34:35 - another state but i'd get a lot of
34:37 - customers that
34:38 - want someone in ohio so
34:41 - you know like they're calling me i mean
34:43 - don't get me wrong i do stuff for people
34:44 - all over the country um you know and i i
34:46 - mean i built stuff for people in
34:48 - literally all over the country on a
34:49 - regular basis but again in terms of what
34:52 - comes in through my website i really
34:54 - focus on
34:55 - like my local market because a lot of
34:58 - people are looking for someone in their
34:59 - local market and it's not as much
35:01 - competition i'm not trying to compete
35:03 - against every single web developer in
35:05 - the country i am competing against the
35:06 - web developers who are specifically
35:08 - holding themselves out
35:10 - to
35:11 - my state um so clearly spell out you
35:14 - know like what geographies you service
35:16 - and the reason i say to clearly limit it
35:18 - to a few services
35:20 - is you want customers who land on your
35:22 - website to clearly understand what it is
35:24 - you do and you don't want them to go
35:26 - sifting through
35:27 - you know let's say you've got like 20
35:29 - i'm making up a ridiculous number to
35:31 - prove the point let's say you've got a
35:32 - list of like 20 things listed on your
35:34 - website that you know you can handle um
35:37 - again they don't want to sift through
35:39 - all that all right so i really just
35:41 - narrow it down to just a few things and
35:43 - focus on your local market
35:46 - that's really what optimizing your
35:48 - website for
35:50 - your local market looks like in terms of
35:53 - geography and content
35:55 - and it's also important to optimize your
35:58 - site in general uh for those kinds of
36:01 - things um
36:03 - uh spoil alert i'll be doing an seo
36:05 - guide for a free code camp in
36:08 - relatively near future but for now we're
36:10 - going to put a link to
36:13 - an seo starter guide from google
36:16 - down in the description to this video
36:19 - so
36:20 - when you're building out your website to
36:22 - get clients online
36:24 - really think of it from the standpoint
36:26 - of
36:27 - a few services you really want to target
36:30 - a specific geography
36:32 - you know like you really want to target
36:34 - make sure the geography is big enough to
36:36 - actually support your business like you
36:37 - know a large city or or even an entire
36:40 - state
36:41 - but again you know narrow down your
36:44 - services narrow down your geography
36:47 - let that be the focus of your website
36:49 - and again it's not everything you do
36:51 - it's not everyone you service but that's
36:53 - fine it's much better to get
36:56 - a lot of traffic
36:58 - for a few things than no traffic for a
37:02 - lot of things okay the former equals you
37:05 - making money the latter like does not
37:08 - so
37:10 - once you've got your website up
37:12 - after that it's all about adding blog
37:14 - posts
37:15 - adding uh you know adding video to
37:17 - youtube things like that do things that
37:20 - you're going to own and that are going
37:21 - to be relevant to your potential
37:23 - customers and that's how you're going to
37:25 - get clients online for your website and
37:27 - the beauty of it is again you do a blog
37:29 - post today you do a video today
37:31 - something like that
37:33 - it keeps paying dividends for years and
37:34 - years and years and years like with the
37:36 - example i gave
37:37 - about my previous brand that was
37:39 - acquired
37:40 - if you just rely on
37:42 - spending money to bring in business like
37:44 - through ads and things of that it gets
37:46 - pretty hard to make some money so
37:48 - invest in your web presence don't spend
37:50 - money on it and optimize for your local
37:53 - market and that is how you get customers
37:55 - online and that's how you get people
37:56 - calling you um on a recurring basis in
37:59 - terms of new business
38:02 - coming in
38:03 - so
38:04 - while what we just talked about is going
38:07 - to bring in a lot of local business
38:08 - optimizing your website for your local
38:10 - market
38:11 - let's talk about some other ways you can
38:13 - get business locally that don't involve
38:15 - your website
38:25 - okay now let's talk about how to get
38:26 - business in your local market
38:29 - as you gathered in our last segment when
38:31 - i talked about optimizing your website i
38:32 - said optimize your website for your
38:34 - local market so
38:36 - that web presence i suggest is actually
38:37 - going to do a lot tapping into your
38:39 - local market for you but with that being
38:41 - said there are ways to go about getting
38:43 - business locally that don't involve your
38:45 - website so let's look at each of those
38:47 - so
38:48 - in terms of getting customers locally
38:51 - offline
38:53 - there are three things i would really
38:55 - suggest
38:56 - number one is
38:58 - to do contract work for other developers
39:01 - this is a situation where other
39:03 - developers maybe have a little too much
39:05 - to do
39:07 - and you know they're looking to
39:08 - outsource some work and you would be
39:10 - surprised because there will be
39:11 - developers who want to outsource to
39:13 - potentially i should say outsourced to
39:15 - you on a regular basis
39:17 - another one would be contacting
39:18 - potential customers directly
39:20 - and
39:22 - this would mean going out and
39:23 - introducing yourself to you know
39:25 - like b2b type things so for example um
39:28 - you know going to like the local
39:29 - restaurant the local bakery the local
39:31 - whatever and
39:32 - offering to build them a website let's
39:34 - say
39:35 - and then a third option would be to
39:37 - go to networking events so
39:40 - let's go ahead and talk about each of
39:41 - these in turn
39:44 - excuse me
39:46 - in terms of doing contract work for
39:48 - other developers
39:50 - you would be surprised at how many dev
39:51 - shops are
39:53 - interested in outsourcing work because
39:55 - they find themselves in a place where
39:57 - they have too much to do for the amount
39:59 - of staff they have but they don't have
40:01 - enough to do to justify hiring somebody
40:03 - else full time
40:04 - and there are it is not uncommon for dev
40:07 - shops to outsource stuff on a regular
40:09 - basis and if you have somebody if you're
40:12 - a developer and you want to outsource
40:13 - and you have somebody that's worked out
40:14 - well for you in the past it's
40:17 - you know likely there's going to keep
40:18 - sending something to that same person so
40:22 - other developers who want to outsource
40:24 - can be a good uh good uh source of local
40:27 - work
40:28 - when you're trying to get these kinds of
40:30 - opportunities
40:32 - it's important that you don't just you
40:33 - know
40:34 - call them up and say hey are you
40:35 - interested in outsourcing and then leave
40:37 - it at that or something like that
40:39 - instead what i would do is
40:42 - actually pick up the phone uh reach out
40:44 - to the dev shop um ask to speak to
40:46 - whoever would it is that would be you
40:48 - know
40:49 - in charge who or whoever's making this
40:51 - kind of a decision
40:52 - before you make that call actually
40:53 - research the company know a little bit
40:55 - about the company
40:56 - then um after the call or when you get
40:59 - them on the phone i should say you know
41:01 - explain who you are explain that you're
41:02 - available for outsourced work tell the
41:04 - decision maker that you would love to
41:05 - send them a copy of your portfolio along
41:09 - with your cv get their email address
41:10 - email them over copy of your portfolio
41:12 - and your cv
41:14 - now
41:15 - and
41:17 - the important thing i should say is
41:18 - going to be don't just leave it at that
41:20 - so in other words what a lot of devs do
41:22 - in this situation is they email them to
41:24 - somebody saying hey i'm available to
41:25 - outsource
41:26 - and then you know they never follow up
41:29 - um
41:30 - you know again this the shop you're
41:32 - contacting really doesn't have they
41:34 - don't know you they don't really have
41:35 - any reason to call you
41:37 - so
41:38 - you know over somebody else so what you
41:39 - want to do is consistently follow up i
41:41 - would suggest following up you know once
41:44 - a month or so
41:45 - for
41:46 - nothing else a good solid year until
41:48 - they tell you no until they you know or
41:51 - until they hire you tell you no or it's
41:53 - been about a year i mean you got to
41:54 - follow up regularly you know like for
41:56 - things like this so
41:58 - don't be shy on following up and again
42:00 - like i said when you reach out um do it
42:03 - in a way where you're intelligent about
42:05 - you're intelligent and informed about
42:06 - what it is they do
42:07 - explain how you can provide value and
42:10 - then just follow up regularly after that
42:11 - and you would be surprised at how much
42:13 - work you could get
42:14 - um from other dev shops
42:17 - a second option is to go out and contact
42:20 - potential customers directly again this
42:22 - is like a b2b thing
42:24 - like this is going to local businesses
42:26 - um offering to build them a website
42:28 - offering to build them an app
42:31 - you know just offering to provide
42:32 - services
42:34 - of some sort
42:35 - it's the same thing when you go into a
42:37 - local business don't just you know go
42:40 - door-to-door and go walking on in and
42:42 - say this is who you are and this is what
42:44 - you do actually make a list of
42:46 - businesses that you want to go out and
42:47 - talk to
42:48 - and then
42:50 - take some time do some research when you
42:51 - go in and talk to a business make sure
42:53 - you actually know something about them
42:55 - make sure you know about what they do
42:56 - maybe know a little bit about their
42:58 - history you know and whatnot and just
43:01 - like with local developers do not be shy
43:03 - about following up until somebody
43:05 - specifically tells you no again you'd be
43:08 - you know surprised at just persistence
43:10 - and face-to-face contact
43:12 - can go a long way
43:15 - so do not be shy about following up
43:18 - the third thing is something i have
43:20 - talked about a lot in my prior free
43:22 - co-cam videos and that is going to
43:25 - networking events um
43:28 - uh bni uh which stands for business
43:30 - networking international
43:31 - is a good source of uh local networking
43:35 - uh
43:36 - uh and you know just other networking
43:38 - events in general so
43:41 - uh
43:42 - that's something i've talked about
43:43 - before
43:44 - um i do think it's always best to go out
43:46 - and try to meet your potential customers
43:48 - face to face which is why i recommend me
43:49 - just going straight into businesses or
43:52 - going to straight to developers but you
43:54 - know if nothing else um networking
43:57 - has been around for hundreds of years
43:59 - for a reason so
44:00 - attending networking groups such as bni
44:02 - can be another great source of uh
44:04 - getting business locally
44:06 - so
44:07 - you know uh that is really it in terms
44:10 - of this guide for what is freelancing
44:12 - and how to get clients online and in
44:15 - your city um i know there are a lot of
44:17 - things i've discussed in other videos i
44:19 - didn't really raise here and again these
44:22 - tips are meant really to
44:24 - uh not just make some money through your
44:26 - freelance business but to take things to
44:29 - the next level uh if you have any
44:31 - questions you know
44:32 - feel free to connect with me through
44:34 - linkedin don't you know don't be shy
44:36 - about contacting me directly i respond
44:38 - to people all the time who you know
44:39 - inquired to me through free code camp so
44:42 - best of luck with everything and i hope
44:44 - this has been helpful
44:54 - you
