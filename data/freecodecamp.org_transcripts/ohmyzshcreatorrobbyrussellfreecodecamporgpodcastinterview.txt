00:00 - [Music]
00:15 - we're here with Robbie Russell founder
00:18 - co-founder of Planet argon Studios and
00:20 - creator of the very popular oh my
00:24 - zsh uh open source repository and Tool
00:29 - yeah thanks thanks for having me joining
00:32 - us from beautiful Portland Oregon uh his
00:35 - adopted home yeah I've been here for
00:40 - 20 what year is it 20 2024 oh my gosh uh
00:44 - it'll be 24 years in uh July I guess
00:46 - that I moved here so yeah more half of
00:49 - my life now yeah and uh originally from
00:53 - California G yeah I grew up in yeah just
00:56 - south of uh like Silicon Valley my dad
00:59 - worked in Silicon Valley and hardware
01:02 - and we lived in a little small suburb
01:04 - town that was kind of on the edge of
01:07 - very Southern there's like I don't
01:09 - remember if it's actually the furthest
01:11 - south town in Santa clar County but yeah
01:15 - it's um it's kind of like at the time is
01:17 - very
01:19 - farmland and you know track houses and
01:22 - stuff like that and so was maybe about
01:24 - an hour and a half or so South of San
01:26 - Francisco and maybe 45 minutes south of
01:28 - San Jose yeah and uh Gilroy that's like
01:32 - garlick town right is that is that the
01:34 - like the world capital of garlic the
01:37 - crop it likes to call itself that um I
01:40 - don't know that it's actually where most
01:41 - of garlic is produced nowadays I think
01:43 - most of it's actually produced in China
01:45 - um but yeah there was a huge uh garlic
01:48 - scene there if you will uh it smelled
01:51 - like garlic people it's either you loved
01:53 - it or ha it if you drove through our
01:54 - town um coincidentally the town just
01:57 - north of us had had a lot of mushrooms
01:59 - that they grew and so their Town smell
02:01 - like poop can I swear on this podcast
02:05 - smell like but they were like
02:07 - slightly wealthier town and so there was
02:08 - this weird competitive thing and like
02:10 - your town smells you guys are poor down
02:12 - in gory they made the the the fossi and
02:14 - bargain yeah our Town's going to smell
02:16 - terrible but we're going to be slightly
02:18 - better off than our neighbors exactly um
02:20 - so yeah I grew up in the garlic Capital
02:22 - world and all I wanted to do as soon as
02:25 - I became a teenager was figure out how
02:26 - to get out of living in gy and move to a
02:29 - some sort of city Urban environment
02:32 - that's what I wanted to be around yeah
02:35 - right on man well uh obviously you found
02:38 - Portland to be like a a good place to be
02:41 - because you've been there for like
02:43 - basically your entire adult life most of
02:45 - it um you've got like a very um I mean
02:49 - you're very very portlandian in like
02:52 - pretty much um your interests and things
02:55 - that you do you're like very outdoorsy
02:57 - from what I understand and um yeah like
03:01 - what what inspired you to go to Portland
03:03 - specifically and uh it was really cool
03:05 - by the way hanging out eating tacos with
03:07 - you it was it was good that we got the
03:08 - chat and um I didn't I didn't know what
03:10 - to expect from the conversation and yeah
03:12 - we had a number of tacos and talked
03:15 - about all facets of life um with you and
03:17 - Abby over there at free Cod Camp um
03:19 - who's become a really good friend
03:20 - coincidentally um thanks to free code
03:22 - Camp uh we can talk about that if you
03:24 - want to but um yeah think about why did
03:27 - I move to Portland well the short story
03:29 - is that I didn't know what I wanted to
03:31 - do with my life my career I didn't have
03:34 - any like real I was painting houses for
03:36 - about three years prior to moving
03:40 - to Portland I I since I was 17 I dropped
03:44 - out of high school halfway through my
03:46 - junior year and then ended up getting a
03:48 - job with like a painting company that my
03:51 - my one of my uncles worked at and learn
03:54 - to sand and touch up and eventually
03:57 - learn how to paint and take care of wood
04:00 - and paint
04:03 - roof the things that are on I forget
04:05 - what they're called flashing flashing
04:07 - and all the the things flashing gutters
04:09 - yeah flashing is like the metal stuff
04:11 - that might be covering like there'll be
04:12 - like you know air vents on top of a
04:14 - house anyways I got to learn how to
04:16 - paint houses for really fancy really
04:18 - fancy houses in uh Santa Clara County um
04:22 - like we occasionally work on you know
04:24 - multi-million dollar houses for people
04:27 - that work in Silicon Valley or maybe
04:29 - they were like they they're like um like
04:32 - one of the players or something from
04:33 - like the the San Jose Sharks a hockey
04:35 - team like their big you know big house
04:38 - they were building up on the hills and
04:39 - so I got to work on those types of
04:40 - projects which were not like kind of get
04:42 - in and get out short projects they were
04:44 - very much like we would be there for
04:46 - like a month two months working on
04:48 - painting and prepping and painting
04:50 - working as their house was being built
04:51 - and making nice cabinets and so we would
04:53 - make paint or cabinets like the big
04:56 - style at the time was making cabinets
04:58 - look like they were basically White
04:59 - plastic even though it was like really
05:01 - fancy wood I don't such a weird how
05:03 - Styles change over time quirky in
05:06 - interior decorating train right so I
05:08 - learned a lot about like the craft and
05:11 - how much work went into prepping before
05:13 - you even pulled the paint out right
05:15 - before the paint dries and then touching
05:16 - up and taking care of that stuff um when
05:20 - I was a teenager after having dropped
05:22 - out of high school and so that's that's
05:23 - what I was doing and I'm like I actually
05:25 - thought I might if you do I think in
05:27 - California I don't know if it's like
05:28 - that all states but
05:30 - before you could start like your own say
05:32 - painting company if I had I I kind of
05:34 - had a little bit of aspiration like oh
05:36 - maybe one day I'll I'll run a painting
05:37 - company like I think I could probably do
05:39 - this and have some people maybe work for
05:41 - me and I'll just work in construction
05:43 - but that also the reality was it would
05:45 - mean that I'd be working construction
05:47 - and I didn't find that you know it's
05:49 - funny that we talk about diversity in
05:51 - Tech over the years and I'm like
05:53 - construction was there was a lot of
05:56 - cultural diversity um where people were
05:59 - from and stuff but it was mostly male
06:01 - dominated and I didn't really like
06:02 - working with just men all the time and
06:05 - so I thought that was you know that that
06:07 - was actually one of the things I thought
06:08 - it was a very toxic environment as a I
06:12 - kind of saw myself as this kind of
06:13 - anarcho uh punk rock kid who was trying
06:17 - to like you know pushing you know like I
06:20 - want my gay friends to be able to get
06:21 - married and like here I'm going to work
06:22 - every day and everybody's talking in
06:23 - very conservative and very
06:24 - male-dominated environment and kind of
06:28 - objectified women and when whenever we'd
06:30 - see women on the like the job sites that
06:33 - was like always like you know there's a
06:35 - lot of cat calling and stuff and I'm
06:36 - like this is not an environment that I
06:38 - feel like I want to spend a lot of time
06:40 - in um so anyways we that's a whole story
06:43 - and of itself so I decided I wasn't
06:45 - going to do that forever and like this
06:46 - is like I didn't want to work around
06:47 - that environment forever so uh I wanted
06:51 - to move to a city and I didn't make very
06:52 - much money painting and I didn't and I
06:55 - was like well I was kind of doing some
06:56 - odd jobs here and there doing some like
06:57 - tech support stuff and so but the price
07:00 - to live in Portland was technically
07:02 - cheaper than it was in Gilroy
07:04 - interesting and it was like it was a
07:05 - city that had vegetarian restaurants
07:07 - like punk rock scene um I can go see
07:10 - music it felt relatively clean um as a
07:14 - city in the sense like you walk around
07:15 - downtown and there' be like you know
07:16 - some gutter Punk kids and I'm like well
07:18 - worst case if I don't find a job here I
07:21 - can just be a gutter Punk kid and get a
07:23 - dog and just kind of hang around and um
07:25 - I'll just I'll figure it out I'm just
07:27 - like maybe kind of glamorized this like
07:30 - DIY lifestyle and Portland has exuded
07:33 - that I I would have loved to moved to
07:35 - Berkeley or Santa San Francisco or Santa
07:38 - Cruz but I couldn't I couldn't afford
07:40 - that those are expensive cities to live
07:42 - in I didn't know it wasn't programming
07:44 - or anything at that point um much to
07:47 - speak of anyways um not thinking that
07:49 - would be a viable thing and the other
07:50 - part of like wanting to move out of
07:52 - California was that I felt like
07:53 - everything was kind of driven towards
07:54 - hey if you should work in the computer
07:57 - industry that like my father worked in
07:59 - Silicon Valley he just retired a couple
08:02 - months ago he worked in hardware and he
08:04 - was always like you need to you should
08:05 - really be interested in software he was
08:07 - always trying to encourage me to get
08:09 - interested in software buy me books on
08:10 - softare I always I always had computers
08:12 - around I had my very my own computer
08:14 - which was always like my dad's the one
08:16 - he basically would grow out of I got the
08:19 - one he get the he get a 386 I got the
08:22 - 286 he got the 486 I got the 386 and so
08:25 - it just be I just learned how to work
08:27 - around with computers a lot as a kids
08:29 - using them to play games and using some
08:32 - of the the software that would come on
08:33 - it making cool
08:35 - little spreadsheets and stuff like that
08:37 - or Ms paint or playing weird games on
08:40 - the you know command line games and
08:41 - stuff like that but uh I just never
08:45 - resonated with me like learning how to
08:47 - programming I just thought it was it it
08:49 - didn't seem like an interesting thing
08:50 - for whatever reason it was like because
08:51 - it was always presented as like hey if
08:53 - you learn if you write out this code
08:56 - into this you know this editor thing um
08:58 - andun run it then you can play the game
09:01 - and I was like okay so I'd be maybe
09:04 - typing what it was doing for I get bored
09:06 - like I've just like you know basically
09:08 - rewriting something from a book yeah
09:10 - under the computer I'm like I'm can I go
09:12 - outside and play with my friends I'm G
09:13 - to go do that you know this is like can
09:15 - I just play the game someone already did
09:17 - it and yeah you're basically doing
09:19 - rework I mean there was definitely a
09:20 - time where there just wasn't enough
09:21 - memory and like it was more practical to
09:24 - distribute printed copies of the code
09:26 - and have people type it in themselves
09:28 - but I'm sure that by the time you were a
09:30 - kid that that time had passed and it was
09:32 - more like a an exercise yeah it was more
09:34 - of the exercise like learning it was
09:36 - never really presented as like well if
09:38 - you get it to run and then we can then
09:41 - change it make different you know modify
09:45 - it to do something a little differently
09:46 - let's change like we never had that
09:49 - conversation so I never that there was
09:51 - never that little aha moment of like o I
09:53 - can do something different with it um
09:55 - and so I wrote a couple blog posts in
09:56 - the past about like how my my dad failed
09:59 - to teach me or get me excited about
10:01 - programming um when I was young and I
10:04 - think it was just like we're that was
10:05 - the ingredient that I think I was
10:06 - missing was like wouldn't it be kind of
10:09 - neat if we can make something to do X Y
10:10 - and Z and then let's figure that out
10:12 - which I think speaks to how I learned
10:15 - about things and why so so very
10:16 - practical kind of appli like you don't
10:20 - seem to me like the person who Geeks out
10:22 - on technology for the sake of Technology
10:24 - itself it's all about what can this
10:25 - technology do for me exactly um
10:30 - the you know I think if he had you know
10:33 - I played I played you know Little League
10:34 - baseball and things like that as a kid
10:36 - and um so what like I remember I was
10:39 - really interested in stats for for our
10:42 - team and so we would track the stats for
10:44 - our game you know for for all of our
10:45 - players couple years I would do this and
10:47 - then I would like and my dad and I would
10:49 - like put some stuff together in like a
10:50 - spreadsheet and then like regenerate
10:52 - this thing and I bring a print out to
10:53 - the team you'd be like here's your stats
10:55 - for the season you know like here's your
10:57 - on based things and your your batting
10:59 - average and pitching details and so we
11:02 - could track some of that stuff over time
11:03 - because uh there wasn't like a web page
11:05 - or anything that kids this you know this
11:06 - is all late 80s early 90s yeah period of
11:10 - time and so if we had had a conversation
11:13 - like wouldn't it be cool like if we
11:14 - could build a little tool that maybe
11:17 - every week you come back from the game
11:18 - and like plug in the new numbers and
11:20 - then it would regenerate the report or
11:22 - something like that probably would have
11:24 - I probably would have that would have
11:25 - resonated I think really well with me
11:27 - but it was that wasn't what we did we we
11:29 - learned I got to learn how to use
11:30 - spreadsheets and stuff like that I think
11:31 - it was like Lotus 123 or something back
11:34 - then but so I still got to learn how to
11:36 - use the tools that you could use and you
11:38 - know like build spreadsheets and stuff
11:40 - like that and coincidentally another
11:41 - thing my dad kind of encouraged was we
11:44 - were always bu building our own
11:46 - computers so we would go buy all the
11:47 - parts and then we put it together and so
11:49 - I learned how to do that with him and I
11:51 - became like this weird thing where he
11:52 - would kind of show off to his friends
11:54 - because they would want to get a
11:55 - computer and maybe they weren't they
11:57 - didn't work in the computer industry
11:59 - um that's I'm just going to say the
12:01 - computer because that's how I refer to
12:03 - it that's how my dad and people referred
12:06 - to it like oh they work in computers
12:07 - that's kind of what we said like now
12:09 - it's like everybody works in now we use
12:10 - like we work in Tech and that's a weird
12:12 - yeah thing to call it as well but the
12:16 - there was this like we' build it and
12:18 - then we like you know maybe a neighbor
12:19 - would get their first computer and then
12:21 - I I would be then sent over for a week
12:23 - or two every couple couple like maybe an
12:25 - hour a couple times a week to teach them
12:27 - how to do stuff on it and so be like
12:28 - here show them how to like open up Word
12:31 - Perfect or how to use the spreadsh thing
12:33 - or how to teach the kids how they can
12:34 - start the games themselves you know and
12:37 - put the floppy thing in here's how to
12:38 - install it but then here's some
12:39 - shortcuts you can add to your DOS prompt
12:42 - to like here's the commands you you you
12:44 - run to like launch you know to play
12:46 - Commander Keen or something and so that
12:50 - became something like I kind of was good
12:52 - at maybe teaching people how to do
12:54 - things like it um and showing them like
12:56 - well if you know if my dad's kid kid
12:59 - could figure this out I could probably
13:00 - figure it out you know like so I was
13:02 - kind of paraded around in that sort of
13:04 - way like some of the so it sounds like
13:07 - the fact that your dad was you know
13:09 - encouraging you and that you had
13:11 - Hardware on hand I mean uh that you did
13:13 - have kind of like
13:15 - uh what many people would call like like
13:19 - uh an ideal kind of
13:22 - like um ground soil for growing as a
13:26 - potential developer in growing up around
13:29 - the tools uh having somebody in your
13:31 - life who was already making a living
13:33 - from these tools and and that kind of
13:35 - seed the seeds of later on when you were
13:39 - you know considering your options uh
13:42 - potentially getting more into computers
13:44 - maybe you could talk a little bit about
13:45 - that that period where you wanted to go
13:48 - into business and pot you you were
13:49 - ambitious you wanted to have uh a
13:52 - company that was potentially going
13:53 - around painting but you you weren't like
13:55 - in love with the kind of construction
13:57 - work culture will what what did you do
14:00 - how did you go about uh ultimately
14:03 - creating a consultancy like what what
14:05 - was the uh process in between those two
14:10 - points there's there's a couple of
14:12 - factors and you know I haven't really
14:14 - spent a lot of time reflecting on this
14:15 - specific point but I feel like in this
14:17 - conversation is kind of highlighting
14:19 - something that
14:20 - I you know earlier I mentioned that I
14:23 - kind of was I I in during that same time
14:27 - that I was painting I was obs obsessed
14:29 - with DIY punk rock culture East Bay East
14:33 - Bay Port um and East Bay um in the Bay
14:36 - Area in California uh it was like a lot
14:38 - of punk bands came out of that area
14:40 - there was like a lot of small record
14:42 - companies that were like it was just
14:44 - like kids that were maybe four to five
14:46 - years older than me had running record
14:49 - labels selling stickers through
14:51 - cataloges and I started one my my very
14:54 - first business was a sticker company and
14:56 - it was like Punk stickers.com and I was
14:58 - like I'm going to oh you had punk
14:59 - stickers.com you had that domain did I
15:01 - did pretty good domain um and then I
15:03 - lost it and I recently just negotiated
15:06 - buying it again but I don't know what
15:07 - I'm going to do with that uh we'll see
15:08 - um but the idea was like I wanted to
15:11 - sell stickers for bands and and make and
15:13 - also political activist stickers and
15:15 - there was someone up in but so I like
15:17 - looked up to these people that had I we
15:19 - go to like anarchus Book Fairs in San in
15:21 - San Francisco and stuff and like people
15:23 - were like all these self-published
15:24 - people that were writing books and Zen
15:26 - and so I had a Zen as well and I was
15:29 - like for like music related stuff and I
15:31 - was like I was just really fascinated
15:34 - with this idea that like there's I was
15:35 - finding a community people that were
15:37 - kind of kind of content creators selling
15:40 - like their Wares but kind of being a
15:42 - little you know just doing your doing it
15:44 - yourself and not wanting to work for
15:46 - someone else it was more like I'm going
15:47 - to go find my own thing and I think that
15:48 - was very much a an ethos of that era
15:51 - with like indie film you know was like
15:54 - people like I think I would like I would
15:55 - have loved to I just wanted to do
15:56 - something interesting and I what you
15:58 - know I thought was interesting and
15:59 - creative that I can kind of build my own
16:02 - destiny and not end up working my
16:04 - biggest fear was ending up in a cubicle
16:06 - in Silicon Valley I'm like that's my
16:08 - intive with computer industry was I'll
16:10 - be working in a cubicle somewhere there
16:12 - will be Windows way down a
16:14 - hallway um far far away and not that you
16:17 - know I I go to my dad's my dad worked in
16:19 - hardware and specifically in hard um
16:21 - hard drive manufacturing yeah and so I
16:24 - would go to the I would go to work with
16:25 - them every once in a while which I
16:27 - enjoyed cuz I would get this meet all
16:28 - these interesting people from all walks
16:29 - of life and people coding and and going
16:33 - in like the the the clean rooms and
16:36 - stuff and seeing stuff how stuff was
16:37 - built but there was but I was like there
16:40 - was something about that lifestyle for
16:42 - whatever reason I don't I don't know if
16:43 - I was like subjected to some maybe it
16:47 - might have just been like punk rock
16:48 - music and being just like rebelling and
16:50 - like I don't want to do what you want me
16:52 - to do dad which was probably to get a
16:53 - safe job in Silicon Valley like my
16:55 - grandfather did my grandfather worked at
16:57 - like he worked in Tech as well like was
17:00 - a traveling consultant and worked at
17:02 - like Atari early on and like so there's
17:04 - like I always had like that was
17:06 - like that was like my legacy of like
17:08 - this is what you're supposed to do and I
17:10 - was like that I want to go do I
17:12 - want to go kind I want to be a musician
17:14 - I'm going to make stickers I going to do
17:16 - my own thing um which I think was even
17:18 - like when I thought about being a
17:20 - painter and having my own company was
17:21 - more like I feel like someone else is
17:23 - making money off of my time why don't I
17:26 - just go do this myself and I don't know
17:28 - that I thought a lot about building a
17:29 - company that would have employees
17:31 - necessar so that was like that
17:33 - definitely cuz I I think I was always
17:35 - skeptical of people in power you know in
17:37 - leadership positions and so I think
17:40 - there was a there was a little bit of
17:42 - that and so uh which I think comes back
17:43 - to the how Planet argon started in the
17:45 - early years of I'm trying to think how
17:48 - to th thread the needle there because
17:49 - I'm kind of going back a little bit
17:51 - there but there's yeah but going to
17:52 - Portland was very much a hey I want to
17:55 - I'm going to go see if I can make it and
17:56 - do something on my own and ended up
17:58 - coincidentally my first job in Portland
18:00 - was a job in a cubicle doing tech
18:04 - support for a couple so you got a taste
18:06 - of like your your greatest fear
18:08 - essentially um just like like
18:10 - circumstance propelled you into a
18:12 - situation where you couldn't deny your
18:14 - destiny as an IT worker as a Dilbert
18:17 - character indeed uh exactly Dilbert
18:20 - character uh I was obsessed with Dilbert
18:22 - back then
18:23 - um
18:25 - but and then that show so during that
18:29 - period of time where I'm doing it
18:31 - support for about 200 people in the
18:33 - company and I started to you know
18:38 - basically a lot of going around help
18:39 - people fix their stuff that was problems
18:41 - on their computer um setting up new
18:43 - machines because we were hiring a bunch
18:44 - of people you know that's doing you know
18:46 - part of the onboarding and and and
18:48 - helping people upgrade their systems but
18:50 - people would come with a lot of similar
18:52 - questions you know things and I was like
18:54 - oh it'd be really easy if I just created
18:56 - like this I had already started making
18:58 - we pages and stuff like that for like my
18:59 - sticker company for my zen and some
19:02 - other like little personal projects and
19:04 - some for for some bands and stuff like
19:06 - that and so I was learning how to build
19:08 - some web pages because I wanted to my
19:10 - first entry into programming kind of
19:12 - like really doing anything like web
19:14 - based was like being able to I wanted
19:16 - people to make a request to order some
19:18 - stickers and so I'm like well how do I
19:19 - build a web page and so I figured out
19:21 - how to like I couldn't I was going to
19:24 - pay someone to build me like a form that
19:26 - could collect data from people and so I
19:28 - I learned how to maybe do something with
19:30 - like I remember if it was Microsoft
19:32 - front page or something eventually I
19:33 - learned how to do it in like with some
19:35 - CGI scripts with pearl so I was like
19:38 - just picking up some books I'm like how
19:39 - do I have like a form saved to like a
19:42 - CSV file or a text file and I can FTP
19:45 - that file down and see if anyone ordered
19:46 - any new stickers um
19:50 - and that that was like my entry into
19:53 - kind of doing a little bit of
19:54 - programming but it was because I wanted
19:56 - to sell stickers so how do I make that
19:59 - happen and so that those types of skills
20:02 - start to slowly start to accumulate so
20:04 - by the time I'm um actually at this job
20:05 - doing text support and I'm helping
20:07 - people I start putting together some web
20:09 - pages like on an internet um because I
20:11 - knew how to like spin up like a Linux
20:13 - server and run what what year was this
20:16 - approximately uh that job I moved to
20:18 - Portland in 2000 so that was like you
20:20 - know fall winter of 200000 um I was
20:24 - starting to do some of that stuff and so
20:27 - so that
20:28 - company you know they they were an event
20:31 - management company and so we did I was
20:33 - helping people do a lot of like CSV or
20:37 - Excel file dding stuff and like so I'm
20:40 - like here's like I could build like a
20:41 - little script to help out with some of
20:42 - these CSV D duping things I started
20:45 - making like tutorials where it' be like
20:46 - a bunch of screenshots so like here's
20:48 - how to set your out of out of office
20:51 - Auto repes so it doesn't create an
20:52 - infinite loop with someone else that
20:54 - also is on vacation that can be uh
20:56 - problematic that used to happen back
20:58 - then on email servers um but so they
21:02 - there was the company started to notice
21:04 - that I was doing this and there was
21:05 - another department of the company that
21:07 - was actually like a web development team
21:09 - for our custo like the company's
21:12 - customers and they're like hey why are
21:15 - you doing all this web stuff like why
21:17 - aren like that should be us that's doing
21:19 - they were kind of like a little bit like
21:20 - why are you so was like territorial a
21:22 - little bit and then and in 2001 they
21:25 - they announced some layoffs and then I
21:27 - did not get laid off but then they
21:29 - called me and do they're like hey if you
21:31 - want to keep your if you want to stay
21:33 - working here we have a role we think you
21:35 - could be a junior web developer for us
21:37 - because you're already doing some of
21:38 - this stuff so would you consider moving
21:40 - over to this other department and I was
21:44 - like oh I get to just do that stuff all
21:45 - the time and not have to go around
21:47 - people's computers and and like and like
21:50 - do I get to keep work and and you can
21:51 - get to keep working on the internet
21:52 - because everybody started to really like
21:53 - it and um that was a whole thing of like
21:56 - I remember them even thinking like it
21:58 - was like a new idea for them and it was
22:00 - only because I just started doing it and
22:01 - I was like ah I'm just going to make
22:02 - this to make my job easier and here's a
22:04 - link you can solve this problem yourself
22:06 - now um so I moved to the the web team
22:09 - and so personally I was like learning
22:12 - how to do some stuff with pearl and PHP
22:14 - but the company they weren't going to
22:16 - touch any open source stuff like that
22:17 - they were all using Microsoft um ASP
22:21 - back then net had I don't think it had
22:23 - just come out I remember going to the
22:24 - net launch though with that team but so
22:27 - they so during the day I was learning
22:29 - how to do stuff with Microsoft SQL
22:31 - server and kind of learning they're
22:34 - basically putting me on these repetitive
22:35 - projects where I was spinning up these
22:37 - like complex registration forms for
22:39 - these events and I would then go home
22:41 - and like well how do I apply what I
22:43 - learned at work today in this other
22:45 - technology stuff that I'm way more
22:46 - excited about which was like open source
22:48 - because it was all that open source
22:51 - World resonated with a DI iy mentality
22:54 - there was a lot of you know free stuff
22:56 - out there I could just download and spin
22:58 - up a website really quickly for some
23:00 - project for a band or for some activist
23:02 - project I was being a part of and so I I
23:06 - was kind of doing this like my
23:07 - Moonlighting thing was I'm doing open
23:10 - source stuff at night having fun with
23:11 - you know trying to learn how to Tinker
23:13 - with things and building my own projects
23:15 - and then uh and building some really
23:17 - really horrible like PHP minus schl
23:19 - things and if anyone really went down
23:20 - the rabbit hole and searched me on
23:22 - Source Forge you could find some
23:24 - probably embarrassing code there that
23:25 - was probably security written and should
23:28 - not be run anywhere but it was running
23:29 - at my company on their internet they
23:31 - would allow me to use the open source
23:33 - stuff for the internet stuff but not on
23:34 - our client work that was too risky um to
23:37 - go into that t but anyway so Planet
23:40 - argon started in 2002 as me saying you
23:44 - know what because I started realizing I
23:46 - was I was building up all the skill set
23:48 - and people started asking me like hey
23:49 - will you work on this project for my
23:51 - business like I have a consulting
23:53 - company where I do this thing and can
23:54 - you build me a website that I and I was
23:56 - like well yeah I can do that but but I'm
23:58 - going to I will only do it if I can
24:00 - build some functionality that you allow
24:02 - you to make changes for yourself like a
24:04 - CMS type tool or something so that you
24:06 - don't have to call me every time you
24:07 - want to like change some copy on your
24:09 - website um because I don't I don't want
24:11 - to do that you know yeah that's like the
24:14 - the first evolution as a freelancer is
24:17 - like you you realize oh no I'm these
24:19 - calls are never going to go away like
24:21 - exact there will always the updates
24:22 - needed made I need to figure out a
24:24 - process essentially of like delegating
24:27 - the change back to the client exactly so
24:30 - that's that's kind of how that the
24:32 - Consulting part started so
24:34 - 2002 is when Planet oron created as this
24:38 - thing and and coincidentally my partner
24:40 - at the time she was a designer and so so
24:44 - she and I uh girlfriend at the time we
24:47 - so we would occasionally work up on work
24:48 - on projects together and so the so the
24:51 - day like I remember sitting there in our
24:53 - apartment we were talking through like
24:55 - hey let's she already had like a design
24:58 - thing so she was doing design work with
24:59 - some clients and that would be like
25:01 - print and web based digital stuff like
25:04 - brochures and things that she would do
25:06 - and I've had this programming skill set
25:08 - and like okay maybe we can collaborate
25:09 - on some projects so I had my business
25:12 - and she had her business um but she was
25:14 - there the day that like Planet Aron
25:15 - started and like touched almost she did
25:17 - the first website designed my first
25:19 - business card she was there when we
25:21 - talked through all the different bit U
25:23 - naming ideas and before we came up with
25:25 - the idea for Planet argon and how that
25:26 - came to be own story but yeah yeah what
25:29 - is the story behind that so so I like uh
25:32 - so for a long time I would make it be
25:34 - kind of a mystery and I would always
25:35 - give this book to my employees I don't
25:37 - know if You' ever heard of the author um
25:40 - Tom Robbins by chance I haven't uh he's
25:44 - pretty well known in the Pacific
25:45 - Northwest he wrote like even cowg girls
25:47 - get the blues and there one of his books
25:50 - called still life with woodpecker and
25:52 - it's about an
25:53 - anarchist um terrorist coincidentally
25:56 - but and like an ex princess who fall in
25:58 - love with each other um and there's this
26:03 - whole he has anyways he the the main
26:06 - character is a redhead and there's the
26:11 - way the the the author is very Kurt vona
26:13 - esque in some ways but he'll have these
26:14 - like chapters where he goes off and
26:15 - these big random rants about or
26:17 - ramblings about things that are
26:19 - completely unrelated to the story but
26:21 - anyway I love this book when I was like
26:23 - you know late teenager and Planet argon
26:26 - there was this like Back stories about
26:28 - where like the pyramids came from was
26:30 - actually there's a theory that like it
26:32 - came from the redbeards which uh like
26:35 - redheads with their technology because
26:37 - they were sent away from this other
26:38 - planet sent to planet Earth because they
26:41 - were obnoxious human beings and so they
26:43 - were redheads were so went not visually
26:47 - seeing this conversation I I have red
26:49 - hair so plan discriminating against your
26:52 - own essentially uh Planet argon is where
26:56 - red heads came from According to this
26:58 - book as like a kind of like quirky
26:59 - little Side Story thing um because they
27:02 - were obnoxious and the people there did
27:04 - not want redheads there and I don't
27:06 - blame them we're we're horrible so
27:08 - anyhow interesting so so it's not Rel
27:11 - like because I think I've heard you ask
27:13 - uh in the past maybe on the your podcast
27:16 - like what's your favorite noble
27:19 - gas you'd think it would be
27:21 - argon and you know we've had I think
27:24 - maybe four or five phone calls or a
27:26 - company people trying to
27:28 - purchase argon and so i' always wonder
27:31 - if that was the business I should have
27:32 - went into but uh really like people
27:36 - people want to buy the actual yeah gas
27:38 - for industrial us maybe Planet argon
27:41 - sales argon uh no we don't but neon's my
27:45 - favorite noble gas like that just some
27:47 - cool stuff but argon I've seen some
27:49 - really cool use of it um there's a like
27:51 - a children's uh science museum museum
27:54 - here in Portland Oregon that they have a
27:56 - bunch of stuff in the show how different
27:58 - gases look and so there's some cool
28:00 - stuff with argon as well and so it can
28:02 - look it can look pretty cool I don't
28:03 - know a lot about all the noble gases
28:05 - admittedly when we had early on in plan
28:07 - Aron when we had when we start we have
28:09 - employees and we were offering hosting
28:10 - services and we had all of our own
28:12 - servers in Iraq all of our servers were
28:14 - named after noble gases and and it was
28:17 - like Xenon and argon and neon and so I
28:20 - have uh there there's yeah you run out
28:23 - pretty quick though you do you do so we
28:25 - had to like kind of like go a little bit
28:26 - outside of that and eventually we're
28:28 - like let's just we're we're running out
28:30 - of noble gases maybe we should stop
28:31 - doing hosting as a business anyways I
28:33 - don't want to have to touch physical
28:34 - Hardware anymore on than yeah yeah and
28:37 - um so let's talk a little bit about like
28:40 - the great middle because I think a lot
28:42 - of people create a consultancy and it's
28:44 - just them and maybe their significant
28:45 - other a few friends and it is fine and
28:49 - it provides a livelihood for the people
28:52 - involved but you've done something
28:54 - different in that you've stuck with it
28:55 - for a long period of time I'm I'm sure
28:57 - you've had lots of opportunities to go
28:59 - work at Big Tech and do stuff like that
29:01 - but but you've kind of stuck to running
29:04 - this consultancy and growing this
29:06 - consultancy um and I'd like to hear
29:08 - about the growth and how you managed to
29:11 - grow it and what what that process was
29:14 - like and maybe some of the pain points I
29:16 - I can definitely interject with the
29:17 - other questions I'm going to step back
29:19 - and just kind of hear what what were
29:20 - those first few years a growth like for
29:22 - you yeah well the first few years there
29:26 - was like no growth uh uh so 2002 is when
29:28 - I started as a you know the Moonlighting
29:31 - type of thing where I worked on some
29:32 - projects here and there um you know it
29:35 - was just enough to have to file taxes
29:37 - you know um but I was I still had a job
29:40 - you know full a day job and then I ended
29:41 - up working actually briefly at a another
29:44 - consultancy that actually got that
29:46 - worked in open source specifically and
29:48 - they're they were known for being
29:50 - experts in post Rescue all and so I was
29:53 - I went there for about a maybe a year
29:54 - and a half or so and it was like and
29:57 - that was was a pretty small company of
29:58 - like less you know there was maybe four
29:59 - or five of us consistently and I was
30:02 - like you know what I think maybe I could
30:04 - do this on my it was like again that
30:06 - like kind of like uh naive kid that's
30:09 - just kind of like you know at the time
30:10 - I'm like 23 thinking I could probably do
30:13 - this I'm doing all the project
30:15 - management I'm doing the coding like
30:17 - working with the clients I'm like I kind
30:18 - of get this I kind of understand and I'm
30:20 - like I want to maybe work with different
30:21 - some different technology tools so I I
30:24 - quit that so I can do Planet earon
30:25 - full-time so that was uh early 2004 is
30:29 - when I officially was I'm out on my own
30:32 - um and to to to make plan argon work or
30:35 - not um the so here's what happens I'm
30:38 - doing that I'm you know trying to find
30:41 - work doing primarily PHP some Pearl a
30:45 - little bit of python work um and I was
30:48 - really excited about I think PHP 5 was
30:50 - coming at the time and it was going to
30:52 - introduce some more o related stuff into
30:54 - the language and I was like this is
30:55 - object fored yeah this is what I was uh
30:58 - kind of I was this is what I want to
31:00 - work with
31:02 - and and then I'm also I have a band I'm
31:04 - playing music at the time um and I was
31:07 - like I had been in a couple bands to
31:09 - this whole time as well it's another
31:10 - thread there but the I late 200 maybe
31:14 - like November 2004 I'm look I'm always
31:16 - looking for jobs on Craigslist because
31:18 - that's where you would find work a lot
31:19 - of time for like these Contracting
31:21 - projects so people would be looking for
31:22 - so i''d be scouring Craigslist in
31:24 - different major cities across the US
31:26 - people looking for like I I have this
31:28 - PHP website I need help you know and
31:30 - then I might get like you know 20 to a
31:32 - couple hundred hours worth of
31:33 - development work out of those contracts
31:34 - so I would just respond that's that's
31:36 - how I would def find work was like
31:37 - things through Craigslist and there
31:39 - might have been some other websites but
31:40 - that just one happens to be a top of
31:42 - mind and then one day in Portland there
31:45 - was an ad for this company that I was
31:48 - very well aware of called cdbaby.com oh
31:52 - yeah and Dereck sers yes so they were
31:56 - looking for a PHP developer here in
31:59 - Portland and I couldn't think of
32:01 - anything more perfectly aligned with
32:03 - like the DIY here's this person who
32:04 - started this business where it was
32:06 - helping independent musicians sell their
32:09 - CDs online because that's how you did it
32:11 - back then we you would literally like
32:13 - you make your CDs and you would send CD
32:16 - Baby a box of CDs and then they they
32:18 - would put you in their store and then
32:20 - they would handle the Fulfillment and
32:21 - the shipping and so they had a huge
32:23 - Warehouse you know maybe like four miles
32:26 - from where I live right now
32:28 - and I was like I knew that a lot of
32:29 - people worked there were musicians that
32:30 - worked in like the full field I'm like
32:32 - that sounds perfect I'll be a programmer
32:34 - I'll get to work with musicians I might
32:37 - make new bandmate friends or this might
32:39 - open up opportunities and maybe maybe
32:42 - open up doors for my music because I
32:44 - wanted to play music that that was
32:46 - really my dream was like I want to be
32:48 - like I want to make make it as a
32:49 - musician and yeah we haven't talked
32:51 - about that but it was like that was one
32:52 - of the creative Outlets that I really
32:54 - started to get into around that era of
32:56 - my life and
32:57 - so I emailed you know responded to this
33:00 - Craig stat and I applied for a job
33:02 - thinking I'll stop doing this Consulting
33:03 - work because I have to con I'm finding
33:05 - work all the time but like if I could
33:06 - work at CD Baby yeah I'll just stop
33:08 - doing this yeah so I didn't start
33:11 - planning thinking like oh it's going to
33:12 - become this thing I'm going to do for
33:15 - the next several decades it was like
33:16 - this is what I can do right now so I can
33:18 - get by pay myself but and maybe
33:21 - something interesting will pop up so I
33:22 - was so I applied you Derek quickly
33:25 - replied to me and he's like hey let's
33:28 - chat I he's like can I come to your
33:29 - house or come can I come to you and
33:31 - we'll have like a little kind of
33:33 - informal interview so we did that he he
33:35 - came over to my house one day like you
33:39 - know in the morning around probably
33:40 - around this time of the day and he had I
33:41 - remember he showed up with a he had
33:44 - stopped at maybe like Whole Foods or
33:45 - something and showed up with like a big
33:47 - little plastic container of pineapple
33:49 - and he was just eating pineapple 9:00 in
33:52 - the morning I a bunch of it and he's he
33:54 - was like I made some tea for him and we
33:56 - chatted for a couple couple hours about
33:57 - programming and kind of him getting to
33:59 - know a bit more about my background as
34:01 - as a software developer he's like oh
34:03 - this is interesting he's like I'm

34:06 - the next week I went out he had me over
34:07 - for another interview went out to their

34:11 - conversations and he essentially
34:13 - verbally offered me the job he's like
34:14 - great because here's the deal Derek at
34:17 - the time was the only developer that had
34:19 - ever worked on any of the code there he
34:20 - was looking for his first programming
34:22 - hire that would basically start to
34:24 - replace pretty important take over for
34:26 - some stuff yeah and to fix the you know
34:30 - invariably you know Hodge fge code base
34:33 - exactly and for this operation that was
34:36 - running really successful he's like I
34:38 - have to focus on other areas of the
34:39 - business now I can't be just head down

35:15 - what he's like so I got stuck in a
35:16 - blizzard um during the holiday break and
35:20 - I had this book called programming Ruby
35:22 - U it's a famous book in the programming
35:24 - world it's like it's a pi it's called
35:25 - the pickaxe because there's a pick like
35:27 - yeah the pi book and he's like I and
35:30 - there's this thing called Ruby on Rails
35:32 - I want to do it all in this I want to
35:34 - rewrite everything in this like I'm so
35:36 - excited about this I love rub like I'm
35:37 - so excited about Ruby I want to redo it
35:39 - he's like but you don't know Ruby yet
35:41 - I'm just learning it I found a guy that
35:42 - lives in San Diego that knows it's
35:44 - already on the court team this guy named
35:46 - Jeremy I'm moving to
35:48 - Portland to help me rewrite everything
35:51 - and so he said if you can pick this up
35:54 - I'll hire you then so
35:57 - so dream shattered take a moment being
36:00 - like okay that's it is what it is it's
36:02 - not the end of the world it's just like
36:04 - okay I get it I had also heard of Ruben
36:06 - ra about a month before i' watched the
36:08 - video there famous like video about like
36:10 - creating a Blog in like 15 minutes or
36:12 - something I was like oh that SS
36:12 - interesting so I was like all right I'm
36:14 - going to start playing with it and start
36:18 - like kind of getting into it I'm like
36:19 - kind of excited about it I'm like well
36:20 - and there's a carrot if I could pick
36:22 - this up and get good at it and
36:24 - understand enough like I'll go work with
36:26 - you know Derek and this guy named Jeremy
36:28 - you know in in northeast Portland at
36:31 - this warehouse and work in Ruby I'm like
36:33 - that great there's a job I I think
36:35 - there's a job here I could pick this up
36:38 - you know so I start diving in more Ruban
36:40 - rails and there's not a lot of
36:41 - documentation because it's new and I
36:43 - have to like figure out how to look
36:45 - under the hood and make make sense of
36:46 - things and so I started like
36:48 - well so that I can remember this I
36:50 - started a Blog I called it Robbie on
36:52 - Rails um and I started blogging very
36:55 - very regularly
36:57 - um and like modifying my own blog tool
36:59 - and I'm working on you like start
37:01 - teaching like showing like how I'm doing
37:03 - things I'm like I had started working on
37:04 - this one project um called my band spot
37:07 - which was like going to be a CMS for
37:09 - bands to manage their own websites
37:10 - because it was something that I had
37:11 - built in PHP for a couple of bands in
37:15 - Portland and I was like oh I'll rewrite
37:17 - this in Ruby and Ruby on Rails and then
37:19 - I can show Derek look I'm I'm I'm
37:21 - learning all this
37:22 - stuff anyhow that kind
37:25 - of Ruan rails that it's like hard to
37:28 - compare it to anything else they seen
37:31 - maybe and like AI has been its own
37:33 - interesting thing in the last years but
37:34 - I feel like with new technologies that
37:36 - come in and just like change the
37:39 - trajectory of like the community like so
37:41 - quickly Ruby on rounds at that time was
37:43 - just like it w it's it's hard to really
37:46 - explain but it
37:49 - was it it it just made our life so much
37:52 - better as a software as software
37:53 - developers
37:55 - that it basic B became this thing
37:57 - because I was blogging about it these
37:58 - startups started contacting me and being
38:00 - like hey will you work on our project
38:01 - for us can you help me build this thing
38:03 - because you apparently know about it
38:05 - because you're talking about it you know
38:06 - on your blog and so my Dynamic of me
38:11 - scouring Craigslist looking for PHP jobs
38:14 - and competing for like you know I'm
38:16 - trying to ask for like $50 $60 an hour
38:18 - and other people like well I pay this
38:20 - one person 15 can you can you meet me at
38:22 - 25 and I'm like yeah how much do I need
38:24 - to work this week um
38:27 - to all of a sudden people asking me hey
38:29 - can you will you work on our project
38:31 - with us I have this new startup idea and
38:33 - so that stuff started picking up more
38:34 - work like that people people were coming
38:37 - to me and I also part of it was like
38:40 - another thing because it wasn't just
38:41 - that I was just blogging Planet argon
38:44 - also because I was I always wanted to
38:46 - work with new versions of technology and
38:50 - and be able to host that easily I felt
38:51 - like a lot of cheap affordable
38:54 - hosting was always going to be like way
38:56 - behind on what version of PHP you could
38:58 - use so I remember when PHP 5 came out I
39:00 - offered shared hosting for PHP
39:03 - 5 people people that wanted so if you're
39:05 - a developer you could do that or you
39:06 - wanted to use the brand the latest
39:07 - version of postresql here's an
39:10 - environment that you could do that with
39:11 - and so you know a month and a half into
39:14 - me really diving into Ruby on Rails I
39:15 - started offering Ruby on Rails hosting
39:17 - to people and so I started getting
39:19 - interesting so it's just a server that
39:20 - was configured to already have a lot of
39:23 - that stuff running so you could like
39:24 - multi-tenant or whatever exactly
39:26 - Multiplex uh a lot of clients on the
39:28 - same machine yeah this was before we had
39:31 - like virtualization being like super
39:33 - common and things like Zen uh xn at the
39:36 - you know came a couple years later
39:38 - basically I just knew how to set up like
39:40 - there was some open source stuff for
39:41 - managing shared hosting with PHP stuff
39:44 - and I figured how to change it so that
39:46 - it could also like spin up a ruby
39:47 - environment for people so people could
39:50 - back then you would just include all of
39:51 - your you know your your gems as part of
39:54 - your repository like your subversion
39:55 - Repository or a c CVS or whatever you're
39:58 - using and so or you would SFTP your
40:01 - files into your this home directory that
40:03 - you had and like I just would everybody
40:06 - would have their own database running
40:08 - and and stuff like that so I just
40:09 - learned how to like I could fit like
40:11 - maybe know 80 to 100 customers per
40:14 - server um and because none of the
40:16 - projects were that big in terms of
40:18 - traffic like they could all kind of
40:19 - coexist and and it worked out okay um
40:22 - and then eventually if you wanted to
40:23 - spend more we would make you know we put
40:25 - you on servers ahe had less customers on
40:27 - it that you were sharing space with and
40:29 - that's that's how that model worked back
40:30 - then but that so I had those two things
40:32 - happening I was blogging and I was with
40:34 - the hosting stuff and then companies
40:36 - started contacting me to be like hey
40:37 - will you work on this project people
40:39 - also asking me hey would you interview
40:41 - for a company you know you mentioned
40:43 - like getting approached by you know
40:44 - opportunity so you know maybe fast
40:46 - forward four five six months um Derek
40:50 - from CD bab is like hey you want to chat
40:52 - again I'm like my my my my my situation
40:56 - had changed you know quite quite a bit I
40:58 - was like oh I'm actually I just got a
41:00 - book deal with O'Reilly um and be weird
41:04 - for him like you go from like some long
41:07 - shot like maybe this kid will actually
41:08 - learn it and to having like an
41:11 - authoritative book uh or blog and and a
41:15 - you know potential book deal with
41:16 - O'Reilly which you know at the time was
41:18 - basically the king makers yeah of the
41:21 - tech press essentially like if anybody
41:24 - was an expert like like having an Ry
41:26 - book meant you were like the definitive
41:29 - expert qualified to write on the topic
41:31 - what was what was going to be your
41:33 - animal you know on what's your animal
41:35 - cover uh did they let you choose by the
41:37 - way no um and and that's a whole another
41:40 - story but book never got finished
41:42 - because the company grew too quick and
41:45 - so that point I turned around the job I
41:48 - said Derek I'm like I'm going to see
41:49 - where this goes um and people were
41:52 - approaching me and maybe there was still
41:53 - kind OFA I didn't really have employees
41:55 - outside of it was me and and my kind of
41:58 - like my
41:59 - co-founder who uh who was starting to
42:02 - get more involved in some of the
42:03 - projects that we're working because
42:03 - there was a lot more design involved it'
42:05 - like start a project so we were she
42:06 - would design stuff and I would build
42:07 - stuff and so we were doing that and
42:10 - we're just being I was being very active
42:12 - in the community there was no Ruby there
42:14 - was no rails conferences or anything
42:16 - that that that was like a year later
42:17 - before those started and so it wasn't
42:20 - like speaking engagements outside of
42:21 - like the local so where was the
42:22 - community I mean it was people reading
42:24 - your blog were people like on IRC yes
42:27 - IRC yep was meeting lot of people
42:29 - through IRC because so people you know
42:32 - Planet argon had we had a IRC channel
42:34 - for for people that were hanging out
42:36 - because they were customers and they
42:37 - would all like help each other we had
42:39 - our forums we had there was the Ruby on
42:41 - Rails Channel um and then there became
42:44 - this kind of like little back channel in
42:46 - the rubyan rails Community um called The
42:49 - Caboose because it's kind of like the
42:50 - back of the train and we were kind of
42:51 - like the this became this like little
42:54 - hodge podge group of people that were
42:56 - were kind of early adopters through rean
42:57 - rails and kind of people that were maybe
42:59 - more
43:00 - [Music]
43:25 - businessyoutube
43:26 - exactly you know he's just you know he's
43:28 - working on you know selling snowboards
43:31 - on on you know on the internet and stuff
43:32 - like that and um so we were all like
43:35 - helping each other in this back Channel
43:36 - like kind of like basically it was just
43:38 - because it was just like a subset
43:39 - because the r on Rails channel would be
43:40 - like hundreds of people and this one
43:41 - made maybe be like 30 to 40 people
43:44 - there's a photo of us somewhere on
43:45 - Flickr like at the first rails comp in
43:48 - Chicago where everybody that was around
43:50 - for that photo like that was like a big
43:52 - group of the people and that was like
43:53 - the first time a lot of us got to meet
43:55 - each other in person um so it was just
43:57 - like that Community was definitely IRC
43:59 - based and blog based um we were all kind
44:02 - of like referencing each other's blogs
44:04 - we used that was back when we would have
44:06 - like a little list of other blogs you
44:09 - recommended people reading you know like
44:10 - I for what what we call that but kind of
44:12 - like a web ring typees thing and um and
44:18 - there was someone that um kind of you
44:21 - know looking back at that early that
44:22 - first one or two years of Ruban rails
44:24 - like someone was there was like a Ruban
44:25 - rails blog site it was kind of like an
44:27 - aggregator that kind of brought all
44:30 - these like blogs you bringing all the
44:31 - RSS feeds into one that was pretty
44:34 - popular it might have been like Planet
44:35 - Ruby and rails or something and at like
44:38 - after like a year there was some
44:39 - Milestone and and then they announced
44:41 - like who was the most prolific blogger
44:44 - in the ruband RS community and like I
44:46 - was like twice as many blog posts as
44:48 - anyone else that year wow and because I
44:50 - was just sharing what I learned as I did
44:51 - it and
44:53 - um and that so a lot of people knew me
44:56 - as Robbie on ra stuff like that so that
44:57 - opened up a lot of doors and then later
45:00 - in that year so this is like fall 2005
45:02 - this is when we grow couple large
45:05 - projects get come my way one of them is
45:07 - by a design company that had a project
45:09 - they were doing a winter Olympics
45:11 - project for this small shoe company
45:14 - that's based in um Oregon called Nike
45:17 - and they were their headquarters here
45:19 - and they were working on a couple
45:21 - projects for nanki one was the Winter
45:23 - Olympics and then there was also going
45:24 - to be a World Cup website and they
45:26 - wanted to build this backend system and
45:28 - they were like excited about using Ruban
45:30 - rails we were like the only people I was
45:33 - like one of the only
45:35 - people on the west coast that was like
45:37 - actively doing much Ruby on rail stuff
45:39 - at the time and I knew these people in
45:41 - their local Ruby user meet meetings that
45:44 - I would go to and I was like hey this
45:46 - project is too big for
45:48 - me can't do you want to come help me do
45:50 - this because most nobody was getting
45:52 - paid to work with not not very many
45:53 - people were getting paid in Portland to
45:56 - work on Ruby on Rails like they were
45:58 - curious about it or even to work on you
45:59 - know just program with Ruby in general
46:02 - but they like to dabble with it it was
46:03 - like they like their hobby thing you
46:05 - know they were getting paid to do like I
46:06 - remember so I ended up kind of
46:08 - recruiting maybe seven or eight people
46:11 - and they were working or like an office
46:13 - attic bought some like folding tables
46:15 - and some chairs from used furniture
46:17 - equip like office furniture um store and
46:21 - all of a sudden it was like eight eight
46:22 - people working in the Attic on these
46:24 - projects and I was like I don't know
46:25 - what happening but I'm like let's just
46:27 - see where this goes in worst case um
46:30 - this doesn't work out for more more than
46:32 - a few months then I just go back to
46:33 - working for myself or I'll just go talk
46:35 - to these companies that keep wanting to
46:36 - maybe hire me so that's when we became
46:40 - an agency was it was it was very quick
46:43 - it was a big project so so you had eight
46:45 - devs yeah like basically like and then
46:49 - did you feel pressure to go out and
46:50 - pound the ground and get business to be
46:52 - able to support those devs well at the
46:55 - time I was turning away
46:57 - work wow so you you could literally put
47:00 - all eight of those devs productively to
47:03 - were were yeah they were they were going
47:05 - to be busy for the next few months
47:06 - because there was a couple projects I
47:07 - mentioned those Nike ones there was this
47:09 - other startup um and I remember I our
47:11 - estimate for that yeah I mean Nike like
47:14 - maybe the biggest Portland company yeah
47:17 - um to get them as a client early on
47:19 - that's that's definitely a feather in
47:20 - your cap well we were subcontracted
47:22 - through a designer to be clear Nike I do
47:25 - not think they would have hired us
47:26 - directly um we were probably way too
47:28 - small they did later we did work with
47:29 - Nike for many many actually still kind
47:31 - of work with them now but um we're
47:33 - almost wind it down with them but we we
47:35 - Nike was one of our was been one of our
47:37 - largest clients over the years so um
47:40 - eventually we were mature enough of a
47:42 - company for them to take seriously but
47:44 - the um but yeah during that period it
47:46 - was like we had enough work for people
47:48 - so they were basically hir them all as
47:50 - contractors um in like maybe October
47:54 - November that year and then and then
47:57 - towards the end of the year we're like
47:58 - all right well let's let's take a real
48:00 - look at like it was a so proprietorship
48:02 - at that point so the business model like
48:05 - the entity so so you had liability yeah
48:08 - so January 1st 2006 we became an LLC and
48:12 - then I offered all those people jobs
48:14 - employment jobs and most of them took a
48:16 - job that meant that they were going to
48:17 - get to work with Ruban rails and that's
48:19 - what they were in Ruby and that was
48:21 - exciting and there was basically just
48:23 - the people that I knew locally that were
48:25 - excited about it I didn't it wasn't I
48:28 - don't
48:29 - remember any any other way of thinking
48:31 - about how to weigh them up if they were
48:33 - going to be good people to work with if
48:34 - they were uh good employees so the
48:37 - interview process was like kind of
48:39 - non-existent because you just already
48:40 - knew them yeah I just met you know I met
48:43 - them a couple times at like the the
48:44 - local Ruby Meetup maybe we we you maybe
48:48 - we got a you know coffee or had lunches
48:51 - together um maybe grab a drink or
48:53 - something and I was like I'm just going
48:55 - to throw these this rag tag group of
48:58 - kids at the I want say kids but we're
49:00 - all like in our you know probably mid
49:02 - 20s at the time I was like let's just I
49:06 - just let's just see what happens and
49:07 - worst thing as I go back to doing we all
49:09 - go back to what we were doing right yeah
49:12 - and the thing that I
49:13 - knew I felt like I had some at least a
49:16 - skill set was because I had already had
49:18 - a couple you know years of doing the
49:20 - Consulting work that I knew how to at
49:21 - least like do a little bit of
49:23 - negotiating I knew how to do think about
49:24 - the sales process and knew that I needed
49:26 - to spend time on marketing and promoting
49:30 - the company and reconnecting with
49:32 - customers after you wrap up a small
49:34 - project like a few months later to see
49:36 - what else is going on so you can get
49:37 - recurring work with you know like I that
49:39 - was so so maintaining that relationship
49:42 - and and having it not be a oneoff but uh
49:44 - you know a an iterated game so to speak
49:48 - exactly and the and meanwhile I felt
49:50 - like a lot of the software Engineers
49:52 - that had been experienced with they just
49:53 - wanted to work on the code and they were
49:54 - really excited about the tech itself and
49:57 - I think back to what you were you know
49:58 - we were talking about earlier in the
49:59 - conversation where I was interested in
50:01 - what it could do for a company so I was
50:03 - like I felt like I was in a much more
50:05 - natural I mean I was super excited about
50:07 - playing with Ruan rails and everything
50:09 - but I was like what can I do with this
50:11 - what kind of web apps can I make for
50:13 - people what kind of business problems
50:15 - can I solve look how much quicker we can
50:16 - build this thing for these people and it
50:19 - was also an overlap at the time with
50:21 - like a lot of like web design and ux
50:25 - improve improvements in maturity I think
50:26 - in the industry where there was like a
50:28 - lot of patterns you can pull from web
50:30 - standards browser you know things that
50:33 - were happening it's just like a web
50:35 - standards being as that was like its own
50:37 - thing the fact that we were even geeking
50:39 - out about like HTML and CSS consistency
50:42 - as a industry was like that overlapped
50:44 - at like at just the right time that it
50:47 - just made I think Ruby on Rails came in
50:49 - and so all new web apps could use these
50:51 - new patterns and so they looked and felt
50:53 - better and for users and so like I feel
50:57 - like it kind of just all got bundled up
50:59 - into that thing like oh rubben Ra's
51:00 - applications feel better because you're
51:03 - using all these new standards and so
51:05 - there was kind of this weird thing where
51:07 - like because you're using these new
51:08 - standards you care about the end users
51:10 - and that's going to make better for your
51:12 - business and and look how much nicer
51:14 - things are yeah versus these clunky web
51:17 - apps that everybody would be throwing
51:18 - together because it' be a bunch of
51:19 - software web
51:21 - developers designing the interfaces
51:23 - quite often and they were just like they
51:25 - weren't great they were just making it
51:27 - you know doing their best and they
51:29 - weren't really thinking about the design
51:30 - side yeah and I think bootstrap came out
51:33 - like shortly afterward and was pretty
51:35 - widely adopted by the r on Rails
51:37 - Community as well and that that kind of
51:40 - standardized and removed a lot of the
51:42 - decisions that you had to make as a
51:45 - developer um yeah and that's like really
51:48 - the strength of rails in my humble
51:50 - opinion is the convention over
51:51 - configuration um just like this works
51:53 - well enough let's not split hairs and so
51:57 - while a lot of people might have been
51:58 - like um you know saying oh rails is not
52:01 - high performance or enough or I needed
52:03 - to do specifically this
52:04 - thing you were just getting down to work
52:07 - building stuff for clients exactly it
52:10 - was just I I you know it was a little
52:13 - bit of a David Goliath battle too back
52:16 - then it was kind of like look this is
52:18 - kind of Underdog thing we're like coming
52:20 - through and we're like no we can build
52:22 - really sophisticated applications with
52:24 - this technology that people were
52:26 - like skeptical to say the least like
52:29 - this isn't mature it's funny because now
52:32 - you know 20 years later or whatever uh
52:35 - it's I feel like we're having similar
52:36 - conversations like oh ruon RS is like
52:38 - this old thing nobody wants to use it
52:40 - anymore it's too mature too mature and
52:43 - like we go back to when I used to have I
52:46 - used to have to have conversations with
52:47 - large companies that like someone at
52:49 - their company had heard of rubben like I
52:51 - really want I'm they were like really
52:53 - proponed like we want to build this web
52:54 - app for this internal thing but I need
52:57 - you to help me convince the CTO that
53:00 - this is a safe decision this is not
53:02 - going to like ruin us somehow or going
53:05 - to plague us with security things or
53:07 - just we're going have to throw so much
53:08 - Hardware to keep this thing running I
53:11 - mean were you doing a lot of like full
53:13 - codebase rewrites like Dereck sers was
53:15 - asking or were you just building new
53:16 - functionality out with rails a lot of it
53:18 - at the time early on was new
53:20 - functionality new web apps um and the I
53:25 - think it probably took about a year and
53:27 - a half two years before we started
53:28 - getting calls from companies to help
53:30 - them come in and repair their existing
53:33 - Ruban rounds applications but there
53:35 - there was a couple projects that were
53:37 - were rewrites or kind of modernizing
53:40 - their existing platform a bit so like
53:43 - maybe there's a part of some web app
53:45 - that they were using like hey we want to
53:46 - put we want to build a new interface for
53:49 - like there was a company that worked in
53:50 - travel and they wanted to build a new
53:51 - interface for travel agents um that
53:54 - could interface with the same database
53:56 - so one of the things that I was kind of
53:59 - you know air quoting known for in the
54:01 - community was being a big post rescue y
54:04 - person but also being understanding that
54:06 - there's a lot of Legacy I came from a
54:08 - world where remember I mentioned earlier
54:10 - my previous job I was working at a
54:12 - company where we specialized in post and
54:14 - I I had a the database to me was like
54:17 - always like this thing that never assume
54:20 - that you're not going to have you're
54:21 - only going to have one application that
54:23 - interfaces with that you may have
54:24 - multiple things that are interacting
54:25 - with it so I always felt like a lot of
54:26 - business rules should be in the database
54:28 - which was like a hard Paradigm for me to
54:30 - wrap my head around when I got kind of
54:32 - adopted Ruby on Rails for yeah because
54:34 - you're doing like migrations in code
54:36 - essentially as opposed to structuring
54:38 - your database in a specific way and then
54:41 - adapting your apps around that existing
54:43 - kind of schema right yeah well
54:46 - technically uh database migrations
54:48 - didn't exist in rubs when I started
54:50 - using RS uh you saw you all of our first
54:53 - scheme is you had to do all your write
54:55 - out your SQL create table statements
54:57 - alra table statements that came in maybe
54:59 - a year two years into rubian rails after
55:02 - I started using it and I think probably
55:05 - help I don't remember if they adopted
55:06 - that from somewhere else but it was
55:07 - definitely like a big game changer but
55:09 - it was more of the you already have a
55:11 - legacy database that has some different
55:13 - application how can we make a ruon rails
55:15 - application work with that same data set
55:17 - and make maybe new reporting tools or
55:19 - some new interfaces on it so I was
55:21 - writing a lot of I wrote a lot of
55:23 - articles in some Library ruby gems that
55:25 - were for like working with Legacy
55:27 - databases so you can put active record
55:30 - and have it connect to some um like
55:32 - Microsoft SQL Server thing or an Oracle
55:34 - database or some old MySQL plus database
55:37 - where the DAT the naming conventions are
55:39 - wildly not what we would consider normal
55:42 - in the Ruban rails Community just like a
55:44 - different way of doing it so so but then
55:46 - you can make it feel more rails likee
55:48 - and so get the benefits of building web
55:50 - apps quickly with rbrand rounds but
55:52 - still getting to leaning on an existing
55:53 - database and having to work around
55:55 - database triggers or store procedures
55:57 - and how do you make that work within the
56:00 - rub rub Ruban rails world and so that
56:03 - was like a part of my I guess my Niche
56:05 - was because I had that skill set and I
56:06 - was like how do I work around and still
56:08 - get to use and leverage ruon rails um so
56:12 - we would get pulled in to help out with
56:13 - companies that were trying
56:15 - to have like a hybrid system there's a
56:17 - lot of companies sneaking rails in on
56:19 - this very small thing and and like their
56:21 - dream would be like and then eventually
56:23 - we'll show that this works like a trojan
56:24 - horse
56:25 - eventually the whole comp going to Mo
56:27 - rails but we have to prove out the
56:29 - concept with this exactly so that there
56:32 - was a lot of like that type of work that
56:33 - came kind of came our way as well and
56:35 - then over the years we ended up
56:37 - realizing that a lot of our typical
56:39 - clients that were startups they would
56:41 - not be our clients you know two years
56:43 - down the road because they didn't figure
56:45 - out how to make their startup work right
56:48 - and so most startups do not uh get
56:51 - product Market fit they don't get
56:52 - traction and they are not able able to
56:55 - raise subsequent rounds um yeah yeah but
56:59 - but obviously Planet argon from a
57:02 - sustainability standpoint is is going
57:04 - strong I mean you're like almost 22
57:07 - years in at this point uh how big is
57:10 - your team now we are I think
57:12 - approximately 14 15 people at the moment
57:16 - um it's funny like every time I get
57:18 - asked that question I don't exactly know
57:20 - I have to look at the slack Channel um
57:22 - it's always like kind of weaving in we
57:24 - do bring on contractors here and there
57:25 - as well we've usually got a couple
57:27 - interns um so that numbers in terms of
57:29 - working directly with with clients and
57:31 - like I guess selling the clients is that
57:33 - something you do a lot of yourself still
57:36 - yeah I do a lot of the business
57:38 - development at the company so I'm
57:40 - usually one of the first for people that
57:42 - companies will talk to and kind of like
57:44 - help make sure it's a good fit for the
57:45 - company we're not like a large enough
57:47 - company to really have in it's
57:49 - interesting people always talk we invest
57:51 - in like we have a marketing person that
57:52 - helps out with our marketing but when it
57:54 - comes to Sal sales uh there's this
57:57 - interesting thing because the type of
57:58 - work that we focus on now is more on
58:01 - helping organizations that have already
58:03 - invested a lot into their rubyan rails
58:05 - infrastructure and platform how to help
58:07 - them modernize that how to help them
58:10 - like do some refactoring projects or we
58:12 - are their primary development team
58:14 - because there's a lot of web web apps
58:16 - out there where a company might have had
58:18 - a small development team internally
58:21 - build or maybe they worked with a small
58:22 - agency or a couple of Freelancers to
58:24 - build some internal tool but it wasn't
58:26 - like a it was never intended to be a
58:27 - thing that they were going to have
58:29 - consistent full-time software Engineers
58:31 - working on they don't and they're not
58:33 - really set up like they're you know it's
58:35 - you know they're a travel company and
58:37 - they're like what we don't know what to
58:39 - we don't know how we would keep like two
58:41 - three software developers busy fulltime
58:44 - right so they have these apps that need
58:45 - support and but they need more
58:47 - reliability than say just working with a
58:49 - freelancer and so we're kind of like in
58:51 - this space of like you maybe for aside
58:54 - from the companies that have their own
58:55 - engineering teams that use us to help
58:57 - them with make some upgrades and
58:58 - modernization type projects or
59:00 - refactoring uh we're kind of in this
59:02 - interesting middle sphere of like where
59:05 - when you outgrow like your Freelancers
59:08 - but you're not really thinking you want
59:10 - to grow into having your own full-time
59:11 - team we end up being so so a lot of our
59:14 - companies were on regular retainer with
59:16 - them where they are basically reserving
59:17 - time with us every month for us to keep
59:20 - an eye on their application to respond
59:21 - to bug fixes error alerts performance
59:24 - issues
59:25 - and they always have a backlog of
59:27 - feature improvements and updates that
59:28 - they're looking to make and so we're
59:30 - we're their team you know and so we so
59:33 - our our developers are working across
59:35 - multiple clients like in a given week so
59:37 - it's a little bit Contex switching but
59:38 - they're all it's all ruby and rounds for
59:39 - the most part and so we're just like so
59:43 - our business model kind of went from
59:45 - working with startups and helping them
59:47 - estimate out their you know their
59:48 - product Market fit and hoping that they
59:51 - figure out how to sell this thing and so
59:53 - that they can get more budget in the
59:55 - future to keep investing to now we're
59:58 - like hey you already invested in this
60:01 - thing you know you need to continue
60:02 - investing in the upkeep of it and keep
60:04 - things updated and um and we're not
60:06 - afraid to roll our hands you know or or
60:08 - roll our sleeves up and get dirty on
60:10 - older applications because a lot of
60:12 - projects come to us and they have not
60:13 - been tended to um in years because
60:16 - they're like well we had a couple people
60:17 - work on it and then that person left and
60:19 - then someone came in and they never
60:21 - upgraded it and now 5 years has passed
60:23 - but we you but 30 people at our company
60:25 - use this application every day we need
60:27 - to know that someone can take care of it
60:29 - so since we've been around forever we've
60:31 - seen all flavors of that over the years
60:33 - and so we can come in be like yeah we
60:34 - can stabilize this and work on a plan to
60:36 - help you upgrade this and interesting so
60:38 - so a big selling point of uh getting
60:42 - Planet argon to work on your uh your
60:44 - code base it sounds like first of all
60:48 - you've been around you're not going
60:49 - anywhere so there's that peace of mind
60:51 - associated with like Hey we're going to
60:53 - get these people up to speed on how our
60:55 - code works and they're going to be able
60:56 - to continue to maintain it uh for a
60:58 - longer period of time and it's not like
61:00 - a freelancer where they're going to um
61:02 - move or um just change careers or
61:05 - something like that like that a lot of
61:07 - that risk is mitigated and at the same
61:09 - time it is a lot less expensive than
61:11 - having your
61:13 - own you know developer staff just
61:16 - maintaining that project and and in in
61:17 - many cases sounds like a lot of these uh
61:19 - particular projects are not such that
61:23 - they would warrant having
61:25 - uh a bigger team no and and I think I
61:28 - think some companies fall into a trap
61:29 - where I've speak with some developers
61:32 - like yeah I'm like the solo
61:34 - developer on this project for this
61:36 - company and I've been working here for a
61:37 - decade and maybe five years ago they had
61:40 - a cooworker another developer they have
61:42 - they have co-workers but there's like
61:44 - but like a peer you know what I mean and
61:46 - like I can't kind of see where you're go
61:47 - is this is the tacit knowledge Time Bomb
61:49 - basically like they walk out the door
61:51 - and like suddenly nobody knows how
61:53 - anything works exactly
61:55 - this this story is like one of the most
61:57 - consistent thing this is where this is
61:59 - another one of the so it's interesting
62:01 - I'm actually helping a company right now
62:03 - and
62:03 - so I'm kind of like in a weird way I get
62:07 - one of our service offering is kind of
62:08 - like it's you know Under the Umbrella we
62:10 - do Consulting right as well and but a
62:12 - little bit of was
62:14 - like um like business I want to say
62:18 - family therapy for teams of like you
62:21 - know I will you know it's it's it's
62:23 - almost guaranteed that always like once
62:24 - every 6 months I'm going to get a com
62:26 - we're going to get a call from some
62:28 - someone that works at a company that
62:30 - maybe has 20 to 50 employees and they
62:33 - have one software engineer that's been
62:34 - there for a really long time and they're
62:36 - like hey we have a situation we've
62:39 - either there's enough work that we tried
62:41 - to bring in additional people and people
62:43 - leave and they cannot work with this
62:45 - person that's been around forever and
62:46 - this is right they come in and they're
62:47 - like great I'm going to come in and be
62:49 - some you know New Blood on the project
62:51 - and a year year and a half later they
62:52 - quit and they're like I can't work with
62:54 - that person um but then they're like but
62:57 - that this person has been so dependable
62:58 - for us over the years and we're really
63:00 - nervous about losing this person but but
63:02 - maybe it's time for them to go you know
63:05 - and they're in this weird situation
63:07 - like can you come and help us assess
63:10 - this like can interesting so almost kind
63:12 - of like U you're you're doing like a uh
63:16 - like a case like a a briefing you're
63:19 - you're going in as the investigator to
63:20 - like try to understand the situation and
63:22 - recommend courses of action
63:25 - yeah or just like can they help them
63:28 - understand can we survive if this person
63:31 - were to leave you know there's always
63:33 - like people talk about like oh what what
63:35 - happens if someone gets hit by a bus you
63:36 - know why we document things and this is
63:39 - why documentation is important and or
63:41 - why we re reate automated tests so that
63:43 - we know that if someone new comes in
63:45 - they know that they're not breaking
63:46 - everything well that sounds great but
63:48 - also when you're a really small team the
63:50 - reality is if no one's reading your
63:52 - documentation and you you're able to
63:53 - keep a lot in your head you start you
63:57 - start making concessions on what things
63:58 - like things that might help a healthy
64:00 - development team work and flourish you
64:03 - like well you deprioritize some stuff
64:05 - and you continue to do that and then
64:07 - people come in and they're like Hey
64:08 - where's the documentation like
64:10 - well you know I've changed this thing
64:12 - six times and no one's ever looked at it
64:13 - so I just I haven't maintained it in
64:15 - Forever you know like the read me file
64:17 - hasn't changed in five years and you're
64:19 - just like okay I get it I can be
64:21 - empathetic to that I understand how that
64:23 - happens when you're working in an
64:24 - environment where you're putting out
64:26 - fires you're being reactive to like hey
64:28 - you're keeping everything running and
64:30 - you're like kind of like thinking about
64:32 - someone spinning a bunch of plates at
64:33 - the same time you know and it could be a
64:36 - lot of work for one person to oversee
64:38 - the whole system but if there's no one
64:40 - to collaborate with consistently whether
64:41 - it's because of you're doing because
64:43 - you're just not great to work with or
64:45 - because you don't trust that other
64:46 - people are worthy of being part of your
64:49 - team whatever this situation is um or
64:52 - there's just not enough budget to
64:53 - warrant mult multiple people to be to
64:55 - work with you uh which ends up being
64:57 - quite a common thing you know this this
64:59 - kind of problem will resurface and so
65:01 - then the companies like what have we
65:02 - invested in or we screwed if this person
65:04 - walks out the door but also maybe they
65:06 - need to leave they need to leave and so
65:09 - for whatever reason I think I can come
65:11 - into those situations and and be fairly
65:14 - neutral I understand how the developer
65:16 - gets there I understand how the comp or
65:18 - the business owner might be really
65:20 - concerned about this and I can like I
65:22 - can talk with these people and kind of
65:23 - Na you're kind of like the Rockstar
65:25 - Whisperer almost a little bit but you
65:28 - know I'm trying to not use the Rockstar
65:30 - thing too much uh they usually just come
65:32 - in in like trash hotels and leave and um
65:35 - but it is it's it's an interesting like
65:37 - come in and maybe I have
65:40 - enough I'm well known enough in some
65:43 - circles that people give me a benefit of
65:45 - the doubt that I'm not coming in and
65:47 - just like telling someone what they want
65:48 - to hear so I mean do do people see you
65:51 - and like panic because like oh no no
65:54 - they they brought him and that must mean
65:55 - I'm like on my way out or no or like are
65:58 - you often able to like repair the
65:59 - situation or or just by introducing a
66:02 - collaboratory like discourse are you
66:05 - able to fix a lot of the uh kind of like
66:08 - documentation not getting updated tests
66:09 - not getting written things like
66:12 - that it's a great question the I've had
66:15 - some successes I've had I'd say the
66:17 - companies have had some failures with
66:19 - trying to correct the situation and
66:21 - where where it works out for everybody
66:23 - it doesn't always end up working out for
66:24 - everybody in some of those situ and I
66:26 - don't I do not believe I have a
66:27 - reputation coming in and like help
66:28 - helping people lose their jobs um I
66:30 - think I'm much more on this side of
66:32 - probably much more on the side of like
66:34 - helping people keep their jobs and maybe
66:36 - making some incremental changes but the
66:37 - people have you know it's like a it's in
66:40 - some ways it's like getting pulled in
66:41 - for like a you know like a
66:44 - physical therapist you go in and like
66:46 - try to get some work done and they show
66:48 - you all things you're like oh great I do
66:49 - these stretches every day this will be
66:51 - good for me and this will this pain will
66:52 - go away you know and I know that if you
66:54 - don't do the work consistently then
66:58 - you're just going to end up at the you
67:00 - know the physical therapist in five
67:01 - years and they're going to like you're
67:02 - like oh yeah I remember I did this
67:03 - before so there is a lot of like people
67:07 - need to want to change some of how their
67:09 - approach their work and stuff like that
67:11 - and so that's that's the thing I'm you
67:12 - know I've been you know coincidentally
67:14 - in the last couple years things that
67:15 - I've been doing is first professional
67:17 - development is taking a lot more
67:19 - curriculum related to improving my
67:21 - coaching skills like okay I'm I'm a
67:24 - coaching these situations how do I
67:26 - better talk with these people get them
67:29 - to think about their and help them solve
67:30 - their own problems rather than me being
67:31 - super prescriptive and like I think you
67:33 - should do it because this is what planet
67:34 - argon does and if you just do this it'll
67:36 - be great for you everybody kind of needs
67:37 - to figure out come to some of those aha
67:38 - moments themselves right um and which I
67:42 - think was also an important thing to
67:43 - learn early on as a consultant
67:45 - especially for designers that if you I
67:48 - always felt we always when we've had
67:49 - designers on our team if they work on
67:52 - working with a client on a design I
67:55 - honestly believe that I've seen way more
67:57 - success if the if the through that
68:00 - collaborative process of a designer
68:01 - working on things that if the designer
68:03 - can help the client feel
68:05 - like show them how their ideas is what
68:08 - manifested the current version of the
68:10 - design versus like a designer going away
68:13 - and coming up back with some magical
68:15 - representation of what they thought they
68:16 - heard the designers that always felt
68:19 - like made it
68:21 - appear that it was actually so much of
68:23 - the client's idea and they just
68:25 - materialized it like that's to me like
68:27 - an effective consultant effective coach
68:30 - is like helping someone see come to this
68:33 - kind of like realization and kind of
68:35 - coaching them that way and and also
68:37 - being aware enough to like that you
68:39 - might not know the best answer and you
68:40 - got to find something that's going to
68:41 - work well for them I'm not saying you're
68:43 - manipulating them but I think it's more
68:44 - of a there's a there's a strategy there
68:46 - I think that can be yield better results
68:49 - collectively so the um so when in these
68:52 - scenarios around coming in and helping
68:54 - helping out things it's a lot of like a
68:56 - strategy that we'll kind of take on um
68:58 - is doing this right now for one company
69:01 - where you know I'm participating sitting
69:02 - in a lot of their meetings and taking
69:04 - notes asking questions asking the dumb
69:06 - questions I always like let me ask a
69:07 - dumb question I said that if you say
69:09 - that like a bunch people disarms people
69:11 - pretty quickly I think um because then
69:13 - you can ask the questions you really
69:14 - want to ask but um and not have to rely
69:17 - on assumptions but like start thinking
69:19 - about like if you if we come in like
69:22 - show them that we're going to use the
69:24 - documentation like hey we want to like
69:25 - one exercise will be we want one of our
69:28 - developers to get your app up and
69:30 - running in their local environment um
69:32 - and like maybe a goal would be how hard
69:35 - is it to bring in someone else to come
69:37 - into your
69:38 - team get acclimated to your system your
69:41 - repo or multiple repos and be able to
69:44 - deploy a small bug fix maybe even just
69:46 - change the footer copyright date or
69:48 - something on your on your web app how
69:50 - painful is it for a company for for
69:52 - someone to come in and do that that
69:54 - because I feel like changing the date in
69:56 - the
69:57 - footer if that takes several days to be
69:59 - able to get to that point like is that
70:02 - unless you're bringing on regular people
70:03 - maybe that maybe not be the biggest
70:04 - concern but if you're a company that's
70:06 - concerned about like hey feels like
70:08 - everything's slowing down I feel like
70:10 - those are like sometimes symptom of that
70:13 - and like you can look at those types of
70:14 - how hard is it to do some really small
70:16 - tasks and people can come in and so I
70:19 - think if you can start removing like
70:21 - addressing those things you start to
70:23 - highlight a bunch of of other pain
70:24 - points that makes it difficult for
70:26 - people to come in because a lot of those
70:27 - companies that are calling us they're
70:28 - not just calling us because they're like
70:30 - hey help us better understand the
70:32 - situation they are truly calling us
70:35 - because they're like hey things have you
70:37 - know like our product backlog seems Log
70:39 - Jam things like our delivery time is
70:41 - taking forever I I'm starting to lose
70:43 - confidence in my team's ability to
70:46 - estimate when we can release something
70:48 - so that means I can't promise our
70:49 - customers that this new feature is going
70:51 - to be out by X because I just don't
70:52 - believe it anymore because it's like
70:54 - we're almost there we're almost there
70:55 - and then like months pass and they're
70:57 - like can you come in and like can we
70:59 - hire your team to come in and help us
71:00 - build these things but they're like they
71:02 - also know they like I don't think it's
71:03 - going to be that easy they know like you
71:05 - can't just throw more people at the
71:07 - problem it's like how do what's going on
71:09 - here what can we do to smooth the
71:11 - process and onboard new people so that
71:14 - other people can contribute to this
71:16 - project and I think if you have a piece
71:17 - of software regardless of the framework
71:19 - you're using if if it's difficult for
71:21 - other people to come in and work on it I
71:24 - honestly think that that's not a a good
71:26 - good sign that you have a great software
71:27 - developer I feel like that means you
71:29 - have a developer that's keeps everything
71:31 - in their head and that's that's not it's
71:34 - not it's not the end of the world
71:36 - especially if they're like in personally
71:38 - invested in their company but if they're
71:39 - an employee and you don't really feel
71:41 - like you can trust someone else to come
71:43 - in and take over for them yeah that's
71:45 - that's a concern to me and I always I
71:48 - remember thinking I remember we had a
71:50 - project manager once who was so
71:52 - organized with how they Pro like their
71:54 - process it was so consistent and how
71:56 - they documented everything they did I
71:58 - was like you're making it so easy for
71:59 - someone else to come in and just take
72:01 - over your job and they're like and
72:03 - that's why you keep me and I was like
72:07 - aha that's great that's a great it's
72:10 - it's very much counter to the intuition
72:12 - that a lot of developers have like by
72:14 - not documenting things like I've got all
72:16 - this proprietary knowledge in my head
72:18 - and uh it's my uh I guess my retirement
72:22 - plan is is like carrying around a whole
72:24 - bunch of details about the code base and
72:27 - uh and not you know writing those down
72:28 - anywhere that's my job security so so
72:31 - you you found it to be the opposite like
72:33 - companies will actually acknowledge like
72:35 - oh because this person is so transparent
72:37 - with everything that's a that's a
72:39 - strength it it should be seen as a
72:42 - strength it should be seen as a strength
72:43 - but is it seen as a strength by a lot of
72:45 - managers or do a lot of managers be like
72:47 - oh well we can replace this this person
72:50 - really easily with like a you know a
72:52 - cheaper developer just out of college
72:53 - because they've documented exactly what
72:55 - they need to do does that kind of
72:57 - transparency hurt your longevity at an
73:00 - organization to some
73:01 - extent that's a that's an interesting
73:04 - one I you know I was speaking with
73:06 - someone
73:08 - recently uh because one of the things we
73:10 - also offer now is recruiting uh as
73:12 - helping companies hire people because I
73:14 - know a lot of people in the industry
73:16 - that may have jobs that they like but
73:18 - would be open to talking to someone and
73:19 - so I'm like I am pretty well connected I
73:21 - can try to connect the dots and maybe I
73:22 - can make a little bit money on that
73:24 - introduction but aside from that um I
73:26 - talk with some people and they're like I
73:28 - got asked what's your opinion on uh how
73:31 - long like a 10 year how long of a 10e
73:33 - developer should have at a company and
73:36 - they had and this was from a like a
73:38 - pretty seasoned software
73:39 - engineer um that's been at a company for
73:42 - maybe like five years as a engineering
73:45 - manager he's like a he manages a team
73:48 - and he he's heard from other people in
73:49 - the company so he's in Engineering
73:50 - Management but he's heard from other
73:52 - parts of the business leadership that
73:55 - there's a curiosity about how long
73:57 - should we keep developers because if
73:59 - we're not cycling in new people and
74:01 - getting new fresh ideas one we might be
74:03 - getting stagnant but two um May maybe
74:07 - there's a competitive thing with
74:08 - salaries you know maybe we can hire
74:09 - people further away or whatever and
74:11 - there's other things there but like so
74:13 - he's like he's like he's like have you
74:14 - heard a lot about that so admittedly I
74:15 - don't feel like I've had a lot of
74:16 - conversations like about that that that
74:18 - was a recent conversation I had and I
74:20 - was like oh that's interesting because
74:21 - I've always think it's be great to have
74:23 - say for a long time but sometimes I do
74:24 - think from like a growth perspective if
74:26 - you depending what people's if you as a
74:29 - software let's just assume most people
74:30 - listen to this or software Engineers is
74:33 - your goal to be at a company for a
74:34 - really long time or is your can build
74:36 - like a longevity and like have uh make a
74:39 - mark for a specific organization that I
74:41 - mean I come from a maybe you know a
74:43 - couple you know a slightly different
74:44 - area where like the idea of working at a
74:47 - company for a long time actually sounded
74:49 - good to me when I was young I'm like oh
74:51 - I don't want to have to switch jobs all
74:52 - the time and like like hopefully I'm not
74:54 - like losing my job or getting laid off
74:56 - on a regular you know every five years
74:58 - like that I think that maybe in some
75:00 - ways me thinking I'm going to do my own
75:01 - thing was a way to avoid that because he
75:04 - would see that play out and still my dad
75:06 - worked at his last job for like 25 years
75:09 - you know yeah what about your
75:11 - grandpa he check he that's a good
75:13 - question I don't I don't know how I
75:16 - think he actually did a lot more job
75:17 - hopping because it was early on when
75:19 - like he was like he at least he moved a
75:22 - lot like the family moved for work a lot
75:25 - and so I don't know if that was like
75:26 - maybe the manager he worked more in like
75:28 - management maybe that was the manage
75:30 - track in the you know the 60s of moving
75:33 - like they go to their Minnesota then
75:36 - they moved to Illinois and then they
75:38 - moved to California yeah I mean I
75:42 - definitely have heard from older folks
75:45 - uh you know my grandpa stayed at the
75:48 - same company basically his entire career
75:50 - as an engineer um you know my dad has
75:53 - run his own practice with like similar
75:56 - partners for right most of his career uh
75:59 - it's it's
76:00 - pretty um common for like people from
76:05 - that they were born in like the the 40s
76:07 - 50s 60s to just stay at a place assuming
76:11 - that they can get a good job and like
76:13 - this definitely holds true in Asia for
76:15 - example in Japan like they have the
76:17 - whole company man notion like you get a
76:20 - job at a company and and ideally you
76:22 - stay and there's like the social
76:23 - contract where they teach you new skills
76:25 - and you keep getting promoted and
76:27 - additional
76:29 - responsibility how do you feel about
76:31 - that like do you think that that is a
76:33 - good fit for most developers that you
76:35 - know or do you think most developers do
76:36 - want to be changing a lot
76:40 - uh I I wonder if it's
76:44 - a I don't you know it's such an
76:46 - interesting thing I think you know for
76:48 - me you know I've been doing working at
76:50 - plan Aram for such a long time now you
76:52 - know like it's funny plus years and I'm
76:53 - like there's a part of me like is this
76:55 - where I retire I don't know the answer
76:56 - to that I don't know like do I still
76:58 - have a business in five years is always
77:00 - running a Consul consultancy is a
77:02 - complex mess of like es and flows and
77:05 - hiring people having to lay people off
77:07 - if there's down ears and stuff like that
77:08 - it's it's just a cycle and then but but
77:11 - at least I get to kind of control the
77:13 - narrative to some degree at least I feel
77:15 - like I'm slightly in control at times
77:17 - most of the time not but you know I
77:18 - think about when people are work for the
77:20 - general software engineering like if
77:22 - you're
77:25 - I'm just wondering if there's a certain
77:26 - element of like do
77:29 - you I I wonder how it's going to impact
77:32 - us when we're for for people that are in
77:36 - the industry and are and are employees
77:38 - somewhere and aren't maybe not in
77:39 - control of
77:41 - it I honestly think that the thing we
77:43 - don't talk about is age as very often as
77:45 - being probably one of the most common
77:47 - biases of you know things that we're
77:50 - discriminating whether we we want to
77:51 - talk we openly mention it or not but I
77:54 - do think I we talk about diversity in
77:56 - Tech but you know rarely do I see a a
77:59 - lot of startups where you'll see some
78:01 - older people in the company you know
78:02 - working there people that are in their
78:03 - 60s you know getting hired and and I've
78:06 - been in part of those conversation like
78:08 - ah that person's like it's hard to teach
78:09 - an old dog new tricks and stuff like
78:11 - that they're not going to like so
78:12 - there's a interesting challenge there I
78:14 - think if people maybe I think some
78:16 - sometimes people will find that
78:17 - themselves having they're kind of stuck
78:20 - in a job or feel like this is this a Ive
78:23 - space now at their their last 10 years
78:25 - of their career because they're maybe
78:27 - nervous about rejection trying to put
78:29 - themselves out there and I don't know
78:30 - how this is going to play out over the
78:32 - next several years you know le as I as
78:34 - as I get to continue to get older um you
78:38 - know there's kind of these weird phases
78:40 - we get through and like sometimes people
78:42 - think that like I'm not up to date on
78:43 - the newest things and like what are
78:44 - these kids in their 20s doing nowadays
78:47 - and but where's that kind of where's
78:49 - that where does that go at some point
78:50 - when people are feeling like they can't
78:52 - get a job somewhere else and so might
78:53 - they stick around just for fear of
78:55 - rejection or or because they've been
78:57 - rejected and like well at least I have a
78:59 - stable thing so I'm just going to sink
79:00 - in here and maybe my opportunities are
79:04 - not going to be drastically there's not
79:05 - going to be a lot of other growth
79:06 - opportunities whether that be salary or
79:08 - promotions but like I can at least stick
79:10 - in this is kind of my area that I can
79:12 - control and there's I'll stick here
79:15 - until I retire um a lot of startups
79:17 - probably aren't they'll talk about
79:19 - retirement plans but do they think long
79:21 - term about like what's a 20 30 year 30
79:24 - year career look like for someone at
79:26 - their company they're still trying to
79:27 - figure out how to make the next few
79:28 - years work let alone think about that
79:30 - far they can talk about we've got great
79:32 - benefits but you know I mean like
79:35 - startups are going to get acquired
79:37 - there's going to be all kinds of
79:38 - creative destruction the notion that you
79:41 - could get a job at a startup and still
79:42 - be working there 30 years from now I
79:44 - think is probably not realistic for not
79:48 - you know in a majority of cases but a
79:50 - lot of that is because developers tend
79:52 - to work at a startups especially over
79:54 - here on you know the West Coast where
79:56 - you got you know you got Seattle with
79:59 - all the startups you got San Francisco
80:01 - and uh you've got uh you know the Bay
80:03 - Area with all the startups I I do think
80:07 - that like if you go to like a more
80:08 - traditional kind of
80:11 - like industry like banking or hotels or
80:15 - you know um hospitals or any like i'
80:19 - I've heard the statistic that like
80:20 - two-thirds of developers work outside of
80:22 - proper Tech
80:23 - and I think in those roles you know it
80:26 - may not be so unrealistic to just work
80:29 - at the same company Long
80:32 - Term but from your experience working
80:34 - like What proportion of the companies
80:36 - you work with are tech companies to
80:38 - Planet
80:39 - orgon how would you define what a tech
80:42 - company is Quincy yeah so I would say a
80:45 - tech company it would be like the
80:47 - product is some sort of like app or
80:50 - software tool like at last is a tech
80:54 - company they have you know this Suite of
80:57 - software tools you know Salesforce is a
80:59 - tech company is you know Ford a tech
81:03 - company I would argue they aren't
81:05 - because they're a car company they may
81:06 - position themselves as a tech company
81:08 - but like that's just a very small aspect
81:10 - of what they really do which is Source
81:12 - parts from around the world and design
81:13 - cars and you know make sure that they
81:16 - meet all these different regulations and
81:17 - stuff right so the tech part as much as
81:20 - they may emphasize that is actually
81:22 - probably a pretty small proportion of
81:24 - the number of people on their team that
81:26 - are doing just that I mean you could
81:27 - argue like Finance is Tech but it's not
81:29 - really Tech in the sense that probably a
81:31 - very small minority of the people who
81:33 - work in finance are software Engineers
81:36 - same thing with like media and other
81:37 - Industries like that so I I I would say
81:39 - very specifically like tech companies
81:42 - like Microsoft is a tech company you
81:44 - know so so I I think I would reach for
81:47 - that Common Sense kind of definition of
81:49 - tech and not um not like a marketer type
81:54 - definition of what constitutes working
81:56 - in Tech no that that I think that's
81:59 - actually a really good way to kind of
82:00 - frame it I I think the thing that I I
82:02 - struggle you know I've talked about this
82:04 - in the past on some other podcasts and
82:06 - stuff like that I've always struggled a
82:08 - little bit with tech because I felt like
82:09 - it was too encompassing I think we kind
82:13 - of overuse it like oh we all work in
82:14 - Tech because we're all software
82:15 - Engineers I'm like well you know you you
82:17 - work in finance right or you're work in
82:19 - healthcare you got to think about
82:20 - Healthcare regulations like you know
82:23 - yes there's some software within that
82:25 - healthcare related company but it's is
82:28 - that it's it's just an interesting I
82:29 - guess you're using Tech to solve some
82:31 - problems I suppose but I feel like I was
82:33 - like is is the is your skill set as a
82:35 - software
82:36 - engineer just that you're really good at
82:38 - knowing how to code um solve problems
82:41 - with software code or that you know how
82:43 - to solve problems in that specific
82:45 - domain you know and you buil up that
82:47 - skill set and so like if someone's
82:48 - working at a Healthcare company and they
82:50 - want to go work at a Banking Company you
82:53 - may may not want to put like you can
82:55 - talk about all the health healthc care
82:57 - stuff certifications you might have and
82:59 - all but you're probably like I
83:01 - understand certifications and compliance
83:03 - type things that would make it I'll have
83:05 - to learn this in the finance industry
83:07 - but I can figure it out but I don't I'm
83:08 - not going to show up day one knowing all
83:10 - of that and but so I think you could you
83:12 - know if anyone listening is like domain
83:14 - expertise from working in a specific
83:16 - field as opposed to like nobody has
83:18 - domain expertise in tech tech is kind of
83:21 - like the uh implementation detail
83:24 - through which the product is created I
83:27 - can I can speak a language uh well
83:30 - there's some people at the company they
83:31 - need to speak this one particular
83:32 - language yes I can do that um may not be
83:35 - like but can you talk about these other
83:37 - Concepts and the this stuff in the
83:38 - domain so I think that's you anyhow so
83:41 - your question was how many like What
83:43 - proportion of your uh clients at Planet
83:46 - orgon are what I would narrowly Define
83:49 - as tech companies in the sense that
83:51 - they're creating software products
83:54 - um it's interesting uh even the
83:56 - companies that
83:57 - I'm we've definitely worked with a lot
83:59 - of tech companies over the years I think
84:01 - right now it's probably in the range of
84:05 - like 15 20% of our clients okay okay so
84:09 - so that that kind of matches with the
84:12 - global like the actual like us industry
84:15 - is Tech is just a small part of that
84:17 - right yeah um so do you think that uh a
84:21 - developer going to work for like one of
84:23 - your you don't have to name a specific
84:25 - client but like what do you think the
84:27 - chances are that a developer going to
84:29 - work for one of those clients would
84:31 - likely be able to work for 20 25 years
84:34 - and you know get the the gold watch and
84:37 - get the retirement and all that stuff I
84:38 - don't know if that stuff really still
84:39 - exists anymore but but basically be able
84:41 - to save up enough money that they could
84:44 - actually retire at some point like and
84:46 - and that they don't have to be careerly
84:49 - jumping from job to job just because it
84:50 - pays like 10% more each time and and
84:53 - that's the strategy of course many
84:54 - developers employ conventional wisdom is
84:57 - if you change jobs every 18 months or so
84:59 - you're going to maximize your income
85:02 - over time by by doing that and that if
85:04 - you stay in your current job you're less
85:06 - likely to be able to get AR raay because
85:08 - you wield less bargaining power because
85:12 - everybody wants to stay their job they
85:13 - don't want to have to go through the
85:14 - gauntlet every 18 months of trying to
85:17 - get a new job right true but like what
85:19 - proportion of those clients do you think
85:22 - that like people could realistically
85:25 - plan to work there
85:28 - indefinitely you
85:30 - know I mean you take like take Nike as
85:33 - an example like that is definitely a
85:34 - place people can can persist for a long
85:37 - time
85:39 - um
85:41 - the it's interesting because I think
85:43 - there's a lot of uh companies are that
85:44 - we're working with where they're a lot
85:45 - more distributed now and I think that
85:47 - sense of identity in organization and
85:50 - the remote world is hard for me to wrap
85:52 - my head around in some ways like we're a
85:53 - remote company now we weren't up until
85:55 - the pandemic and interesting so you let
85:57 - your lease go we let our lease go you
86:00 - know we had but when that happened we
86:02 - had already talked about maybe
86:04 - downsizing and maybe having s hiring
86:06 - people a little bit further away not
86:08 - just focusing on you know because
86:10 - basically we were 90% of our team would
86:12 - always be based in Portland and so I was
86:14 - like who are the best people that we can
86:16 - afford in Portland Oregon you know who
86:18 - do we move out here we would move people
86:20 - um you we move people here maybe two
86:22 - years before the pandemic we'd moved
86:24 - them to Portland you know and so and
86:26 - we'd also have to think who else is
86:28 - opening up shop in Portland
86:30 - airbnbs you know setting up an office
86:32 - and are they potentially now a
86:35 - competitor for our talent you know um
86:38 - because they use Ruby on Rails for some
86:39 - of their stack at the time and so those
86:42 - are the things you used to think about
86:43 - in a location based thing so I'm
86:44 - thinking about like company people
86:45 - sticking around at a company for 25
86:47 - years 30 years and in a remote world
86:52 - I'm just like there's a part of me I
86:54 - like have some trouble wrapping my head
86:55 - around what that looks like and the
86:56 - sense of like longevity and getting that
86:59 - go you know like and there's there's
87:02 - been companies that have been able to do
87:03 - that for you know the last couple
87:05 - decades I'm just not as familiar with
87:07 - them I don't have a lot of reference
87:09 - points I'm just like yeah because
87:10 - there's another part of me it's just
87:11 - like it feels
87:12 - very you know like it seems like
87:15 - everybody that works to plan enjoys it
87:17 - they raid us well we got you know
87:19 - awarded you know one of the best places
87:21 - workplaces you know it's like this
87:23 - online thing last year and I'm just like
87:25 - but but it feels different for me you
87:27 - know just being completely honest I'm
87:28 - like this is a really different thing
87:29 - era for me or I'm trying to get R my
87:31 - head around how do you bond with your
87:32 - team and what is what is what is it what
87:35 - is what is it that you like because we
87:37 - don't have I'm not able to make you
87:39 - waffles on January the first first the
87:41 - first day first business day of the year
87:43 - that was always a tradition like how do
87:44 - we we don't what is it about some
87:47 - waffles in like one of those uh those
87:50 - boxes with the dry iceers something the
87:53 - probably would very good waffles so I
87:55 - think is it's an interesting thing where
87:57 - I'm
87:58 - um to answer that question like I have
88:00 - no clue like and I'm not going to
88:02 - pretend that pretend to know I'm just
88:03 - like will people want to work and sign
88:05 - into someone's whatever in 10 years
88:07 - whatever the equipment of someone's
88:09 - slack is and every day and chat with
88:13 - each other for like at some point you're
88:14 - going to want to chat with other people
88:16 - I don't know so yeah I mean who knows
88:18 - maybe we'll have teleportation or
88:19 - something like like or it'll just be
88:22 - like trivially you know easy to get
88:24 - around the world and we'll we'll figure
88:25 - it out some sort of system that doesn't
88:26 - emit tons of carbon every time we get on
88:28 - a plane who knows uh but uh yeah I I can
88:33 - definitely see like remote work throwing
88:35 - a a wrench in like long-term planning
88:38 - and and like our intuition for team
88:40 - Rapport we're fully Re remote free C
88:44 - Camp and we've got about 30 people
88:45 - around the world working on the open
88:48 - source code base and working on
88:49 - instructional design and uh you know
88:53 - like we we meet for you know one 30 to
88:55 - 45 minute slot each week and the rest of
88:58 - it is just kind of ad hoc meetings and
89:00 - stuff and how do you build rapport well
89:02 - you know we're flying people into Dallas
89:04 - to to hang out for a while What
89:06 - proportion of your team is in Portland
89:08 - though
89:09 - now let's see there's what four so
89:14 - there's four of us here now um two of
89:17 - them we hired after the pandemic started
89:20 - um so only one
89:22 - person because my business partner moved
89:24 - out of moved moved out of the area
89:26 - during the pandemic so um so yeah we
89:30 - have one person that was pre pandemic
89:32 - from Portland that's still with us so
89:34 - we've just had to get used to a cycle of
89:36 - constant change so I think that also
89:37 - speaks to why it's harder for me to wrap
89:39 - my head around plus long term there and
89:41 - like now I'm thinking more of like there
89:42 - are certain types of business entities
89:44 - we can we have had clients that we've
89:46 - been working with for you know 8 to 12
89:47 - Years yet we've been able to show them
89:50 - that we can have Engineers on our team
89:52 - come and go and we can manage the
89:54 - projects keep continuity and persist
89:57 - like some collective knowledge about how
89:59 - to keep these projects running and stuff
90:00 - like that so that's one of our so
90:02 - there's a now A Thing part of me it's
90:04 - like longevity is important with employ
90:06 - I want employees to want to work here as
90:07 - long as they are but also 10year length
90:09 - is less of an emphasis now I think
90:12 - because I'm just like this might be a
90:13 - really good opportunity for someone for
90:14 - a few years you get a lot of experience
90:15 - maybe at some point in their career
90:17 - we're either really good place for
90:19 - someone early on in their career as a
90:20 - junior developer to get exposed to a lot
90:21 - of stuff that could be really valuable
90:22 - to them and we're also a good place for
90:24 - people that are further along in their
90:26 - career and they're maybe they've seen a
90:28 - lot and they're like you know what I
90:29 - want to apply some of the skills to a
90:30 - broad range of problems and I can bring
90:33 - in all this knowledge I have across get
90:35 - to work with lots of different projects
90:36 - Now versus just working at one company
90:38 - so that's kind of
90:41 - our our recruitment strategy in some
90:43 - ways now is like we can hire both ends
90:45 - of that and like the people that are
90:46 - kind of in that middle part of their or
90:49 - early middle like ambitious part of
90:50 - their thing we're not we don't we're not
90:52 - set up to like have lots of promotions
90:53 - we've got like a couple tiers yeah um
90:55 - and that and we can't keep raising our
90:57 - hourly rates at the same rate that your
90:59 - salary range wants to increase go work
91:01 - at that startup that's getting funded
91:02 - and can offer those other things like
91:04 - what I promise you is you're going to
91:05 - get we're only going to ask you to work
91:07 - this much a week we're going to work on
91:08 - different these types of client projects
91:10 - it's going to be a little messy you're
91:11 - going to need to be okay with that but
91:12 - you're going to get a lot of exposure to
91:13 - things and we're not going to call you
91:16 - on the weekends or in the evening to
91:17 - work on things unless there's like a
91:18 - really big fire that we need your help
91:20 - with otherwise we just want consistent
91:22 - stability and we want to do good client
91:24 - work and enjoy the rest of our what the
91:27 - other projects we've got going on in our
91:29 - lives yeah I mean that's a huge selling
91:32 - point for an employer to just be able to
91:33 - say no we really mean it we're really
91:35 - serious about you know the 40-hour work
91:38 - week and not having to be like patched
91:41 - in constantly on slack or whatever right
91:44 - um so yeah cudos you for uh figuring out
91:47 - kind of like a proposition where you can
91:49 - compete with you know companies that
91:52 - have way more money to throw at
91:54 - developers
91:56 - um one of the things that you know
91:58 - strikes me talking about uh longevity in
92:00 - careers is you know maintainability in
92:04 - software and continuity in having that
92:08 - code base that's been a core focus of
92:10 - yours and I'd like to shift gears a
92:13 - little bit and talk about the
92:15 - maintainable podcast excellent podcast
92:17 - which I've enjoyed listening to before I
92:20 - do I just want to point out that earlier
92:22 - I joke that teleportation might be
92:24 - possible in like 15 years I just want to
92:26 - say that I think that's probably the
92:27 - least likely technology that we'll have
92:30 - and I don't even think we'll have
92:31 - teleportation in the 24th century when
92:35 - Star Trek is happening I I think it's
92:36 - it's such a hard problem that I doubt it
92:38 - will actually exist so that was a joke
92:40 - for all the uh physics people that are
92:43 - listening in uh the doctors all the
92:44 - people out there that are like the
92:47 - philosophers um thinking that I I don't
92:49 - want them to walk away thinking that I
92:50 - think teleportation is going to happen
92:52 - anytime soon so um you've done 160
92:56 - episodes of maintainable 160 episodes so
92:59 - you've really you know maintained that
93:02 - podcast and you've optimized for you
93:04 - know longevity in that podcast what's
93:06 - the core focus of the show
93:10 - consistent conversations I think is part
93:12 - of it a consistent formula
93:16 - the the the way I look when I started
93:18 - the project there was a couple things
93:20 - you know you know
93:22 - useful to mention about how I think
93:24 - about approaching new projects like when
93:27 - I started that particular the podcast
93:29 - but how I think about projects in
93:30 - general now um but I knew that I wanted
93:35 - to have conversations with people that I
93:37 - felt like would hopefully still show to
93:41 - be relevant and valuable in then you
93:44 - know 10 to 15 years after the
93:46 - conversation was had and so I wanted to
93:50 - have conversations with people not not
93:52 - about what's
93:53 - new what's exciting what's the newest
93:55 - trends I mean that stuff occasionally
93:58 - you know trickles into the conversations
94:00 - you know like teleportation we don't
94:02 - talk about I don't talk about the future
94:04 - and stuff as much and um mainly because
94:08 - I don't know it is and I'm not g I'm not
94:10 - a good predictor of these things but
94:12 - what I do know is I've seen a lot of
94:14 - consistent problems resurface regardless
94:16 - of the technology platform I also wanted
94:18 - to have conversations with people that
94:20 - are not specifically you know I I'm I'm
94:23 - a Ruby on Rails software engineer was
94:25 - Robbie on Rails think that's my
94:27 - company's core Focus for the most part
94:28 - we also do some react and some other
94:30 - stuff I don't personally do much react
94:32 - maybe written like 20 lines of react
94:33 - code my whole life um it's not the it's
94:35 - not the thing that kind of excited me
94:37 - because again I'm more excited about
94:38 - what can I do than what I can do you
94:39 - know what the the technology itself was
94:41 - and we already had enough client work to
94:43 - keep me busy working with Ruby and rail
94:45 - stuff so the so when I did the
94:48 - maintainable software pack podcast I
94:50 - want to have conversations about what
94:52 - were some good different people's
94:54 - perspectives on what it meant to be a to
94:57 - maintain your software to what it what
95:00 - well-maintained software looks like what
95:01 - it feels like what it's like to work
95:02 - with it on a regular basis what's what
95:04 - is it like to join a project where
95:06 - there's already a lot of existing code
95:08 - because I think a lot of people in the
95:10 - education because it's just the way it
95:12 - ends up working sometimes is that you
95:14 - you get to learn how to build new things
95:16 - what when you you get introduced to
95:17 - programming and again like I we talked
95:19 - earlier at the very beginning of the
95:20 - conversation it was like hey if you
95:21 - write all this code you can play this
95:23 - game but it'd be like what if we could
95:25 - modify it how do we make how do we
95:26 - update it how do we improve upon it how
95:28 - do we make it easier to develop with how
95:30 - do we remove developer friction that
95:32 - stuff is the stuff that I'm most
95:34 - interested about because I felt like
95:35 - Ruby on Rails when I was interested like
95:37 - it removed a lot of friction made a lot
95:38 - of decisions for me and It produced
95:41 - better easier to build things but then
95:43 - it didn't
95:44 - prevent problems from occurring still
95:47 - within teams knowledge getting lost
95:50 - documentation problems
95:52 - um how we think about testing and how we
95:54 - have conversations about technical debt
95:56 - and overdue upgrades and how do we work
95:58 - with people that don't understand what
96:02 - tech de Tech debt is or do we even use
96:05 - the word Tech debt yeah let's just
96:06 - describe Tech that very quickly like two
96:08 - sentence explanation of what that is for
96:10 - anybody listening who doesn't uh
96:12 - understand that concept yet yeah this is
96:15 - a question I ask almost every one of my
96:17 - guests and it's very rarely consistently
96:20 - the same so if even my definition is
96:22 - going to be my version of it so I see
96:25 - Tech Deb
96:26 - is um the things that are that have
96:29 - accumul like kind of we use this
96:32 - metaphor because because it kind of goes
96:34 - back to like you you get debt and you
96:36 - pay it off is kind of like you know in
96:38 - the you know when you're getting a loan
96:39 - for something and we've kind
96:42 - of we've taken that and maybe stretched
96:44 - a little further in our industry some
96:46 - you know I don't think I like to use the
96:49 - word technical debt but I like to talk
96:51 - about it in the sense that it's it's I
96:54 - think the best example of it and it
96:56 - should be six two two sentence I'm not
96:58 - doing a very good job at that uh defin
97:01 - this is why it's I think it's why I love
97:02 - asking the question is it's hard uh to
97:05 - answer clearly because it's I think of
97:08 - it as like the you've made some
97:11 - intentional decisions or maybe
97:12 - even subconsciously decided to forgo
97:16 - something to get something done now but
97:20 - you're probably going to later going to
97:22 - need to later come back and revisit
97:23 - something but maybe something's good
97:25 - enough for now or you've said this is
97:28 - going to get this this code change is
97:30 - going to get out the door but you know
97:32 - we probably in you know down the road a
97:34 - little bit we're going to need to go
97:35 - back and revisit this thing because this
97:36 - is not going to scale for whatever
97:37 - reason and so there's that where's that
97:39 - balance between is it is it a debt or is
97:41 - it just like a concession that you made
97:43 - a tradeoff it's kind of like I think
97:45 - tradeoffs is maybe is a better way to
97:47 - frame them sometimes but I think another
97:50 - way to look at is like you can go to any
97:52 - team you be like what are like ask every
97:53 - developer on a team five things that are
97:56 - causing you friction in the code base or
97:58 - things that you feel like we're we
98:00 - should have changed a while ago
98:02 - everybody can probably sit down with an
98:03 - hour or two and make a good list of five
98:05 - things will they all match I don't know
98:08 - um but that might go into a technical
98:10 - debt backlog and then there's kind of
98:12 - Maintenance work that needs to happen so
98:13 - you're building new features and
98:15 - occasionally you need to go take care of
98:16 - some like
98:17 - overdue behind the scenes updates
98:20 - refactorings
98:21 - upgrades you know migrations is from one
98:25 - search engine tool to some other you
98:27 - know fulltech searching tool what
98:29 - whatever the thing might be because it
98:30 - doesn't it's no longer being supported
98:32 - or it's you know it's going to be a
98:34 - problem down the road so it it's kind of
98:37 - like was not a super clear answer but
98:40 - basically like you're kind of debt
98:41 - financing getting things now yeah and
98:44 - you are going to eventually have to pay
98:46 - the piper so to speak and uh fix those
98:49 - things if you want to have code that
98:51 - continues to work one one thing that I
98:54 - want to make sure everybody listening to
98:56 - this realizes that that I think a lot of
98:58 - people may take for granted
98:59 - non-developers and developers who are
99:01 - just getting into the field it's just
99:03 - how quickly software starts to break
99:05 - down there's a craft an important part
99:08 - for teams to figure out how they're
99:09 - going to
99:12 - regularly it's like when you you build a
99:14 - a a physical building and no one's kind
99:17 - of confused about their needing to be
99:19 - regular upkeep on it right and so I
99:21 - think it's we talk about I want to have
99:22 - this conversation with a lot of with
99:23 - with our industry
99:25 - because there are times where we build
99:28 - things for whether you're you're working
99:30 - on a part of a team or maybe if you work
99:32 - at a company that's founded by probably
99:35 - some people that understand software you
99:36 - understand this but I work with a lot
99:37 - I've worked with a lot of companies over
99:38 - the years where they build something and
99:41 - they're like What's the we need an
99:43 - estimate buil to build this piece of
99:45 - software and so someone built it for
99:47 - them and then they're like great thank
99:50 - you we got we need talk to you later and
99:53 - then they're like hey there's a bug like
99:55 - a month later like what do we do about
99:57 - this there's a performance issue or this
100:00 - weird Edge case so there's like regular
100:01 - okay we need to spend money on we need
100:03 - to invest time developer time into just
100:06 - taking care of those types of requests
100:08 - but they don't always realize that
100:09 - there's all these other little things
100:10 - behind the scenes that they're not
100:12 - requesting or their users aren't
100:13 - requesting but are just like hey look
100:15 - there's new versions of things there's
100:16 - security patches that have come out um
100:19 - Apple has their own chipsets now and the
100:22 - version of Ruby that we were running on
100:25 - is no longer supported or no one's
100:27 - compiled it yet for that and so if we
100:30 - get a new our developers get new laptops
100:32 - all of a sudden we can't spin up the
100:33 - application we need to upgrade Ruby and
100:36 - we need to patch things out in the
100:37 - production servers what have you there's
100:39 - security patches that need to get
100:40 - deployed so all these like little things
100:42 - that need to happen but your team needs
100:43 - to have like a cohesive workflow for
100:46 - regularly taking care of that stuff you
100:48 - can automate some of that stuff now with
100:50 - some tools but you need to take care of
100:52 - that stuff and there's but there's still
100:54 - a lot of things that are just more like
100:56 - code Centric things that like oh we
100:58 - designed it this way because that was
100:59 - the pattern that was kind of invogue at
101:01 - the time two years later we're now we're
101:03 - starting to see that we're having to
101:04 - work put a lot of workarounds because
101:07 - it's not quite we didn't quite use it
101:08 - the way we thought we would maybe we
101:10 - need to revisit this part of the
101:11 - application to simplify it or there's a
101:15 - lot of companies that you know there's a
101:17 - lot of conversations you know 10 years
101:18 - ago about let's all move to microser
101:20 - like you know let's break everything out
101:22 - into lots of microservices because then
101:23 - everything's kind of these bite-sized
101:25 - pieces and it all fit together and it
101:26 - won't matter if the microservice isn't
101:28 - there our team is scaling like crazy
101:30 - we're hiring 50 new Engineers every six
101:32 - months that's what going to keep
101:33 - happening so this will be the best way
101:34 - to keep everything kind of scaling for
101:37 - us and then fast forward 5 10 years and
101:39 - they're like the team's now 20th of the
101:41 - size and responsible for the amount of
101:44 - microservices that a team that was four
101:46 - times as big generated and they're like
101:48 - this is too much for us to keep in our
101:50 - head heads and what how do we manage all
101:52 - this stuff and so that becomes a
101:54 - maintenance problem and just like
101:56 - thinking about as your the decisions
101:58 - you're making at different points in the
102:00 - life cycle of a software project can
102:01 - come back and haunt you and and I want
102:03 - to have those stories and let people
102:05 - know that they're not alone that these
102:07 - are common things and also to remind
102:09 - people that most of software engineering
102:11 - isn't getting to be there day one to
102:14 - spin up the new application and get to
102:15 - build the new features a lot of what
102:17 - being a software engineer is maintenance
102:19 - work making small up bug fixes figuring
102:22 - out the quirky performance problem
102:24 - trying to understand why something was
102:25 - working in a really weird way retesting
102:29 - things and so that's the conversation
102:32 - I'm trying to have with guest on
102:33 - maintainable awesome yeah it's a great
102:35 - podcast and uh one question I had for
102:38 - you is like just off the top of your
102:40 - head for somebody who's totally new to
102:42 - listening to the podcast who's been
102:43 - doing software development for a while
102:45 - wants to be learning more and thinking
102:47 - more about maintainability of their code
102:50 - and of their their company's codebase
102:52 - and everything is there a particular
102:54 - episode that just jumps out at you is
102:55 - like oh this episode like I'm so proud
102:57 - of this
103:00 - episode you know it's a good question
103:03 - thinking about a couple that come to
103:06 - mind you know you know this is this
103:08 - again this is over almost five years of
103:11 - episodes 160 episodes yeah um so for
103:14 - that sort of like early
103:17 - on you know I'm thinking of Sandy Mets
103:20 - oh yeah as is one was one of my favorite
103:24 - conversations on there very famous rails
103:26 - developer yeah and rubius and
103:28 - objectoriented programmer and just like
103:30 - hearing her talk about like oh I'll just
103:32 - be in a in like a ruby object in a class
103:37 - file in a ruby thing and she's like I
103:39 - just start adding more classes to the
103:40 - bottom of the page and I'm just like
103:41 - what are you talking about um it was I
103:45 - learned a lot from that conversation um
103:48 - yeah that's one that quickly comes to
103:50 - mind I'm include that uh link to that in
103:52 - the show notes the video description on
103:55 - YouTube uh everybody check that out I I
103:57 - am also going to
103:59 - include do my shell which is just this
104:04 - fantastic article that you wrote many
104:06 - years ago and and you actually came on
104:08 - the free Cod cam podcast and read it uh
104:12 - Episode
104:13 - 34 uh back in
104:15 - 2018 uh so like instead of trying to
104:18 - drill deep into the story of Zell om my
104:22 - Zell and uh the open source you know
104:25 - boohemoth that you have set into motion
104:27 - uh I'm going to encourage people to to
104:29 - listen to that but one thing I do want
104:31 - to talk to you about is the Synergy uh
104:34 - you have this very popular uh one of the
104:38 - most ubiquitously used certainly on Mac
104:42 - uh tools uh command line tools and you
104:46 - also have this podcast about
104:49 - maintainability you of course have your
104:52 - uh Robbie on Rails blog that you were
104:56 - updating as of you know four or five
104:58 - years ago um and and of course you've
105:01 - got the consultancy planet argon and I
105:04 - wanted to think about like how those
105:06 - have those kind of like Voltron together
105:08 - to create like the ultimate like lean
105:11 - mean like Robbie Russell publicizing
105:14 - machine over the years like like do
105:16 - people come to you and like oh yeah I'm
105:17 - a huge fan of om my Zell or I'm a fan of
105:20 - the podcast like does that resting
105:22 - client work for you
105:24 - all you'd think you know I get this from
105:27 - a lot of people and they they're
105:29 - surprised to find out that it it doesn't
105:33 - really I can't say that like a lot of my
105:37 - clients probably give a or even
105:39 - know what the hell om Zell is
105:41 - occasionally I'll be on a call with a
105:43 - client and they might have some
105:45 - engineers and then they they they might
105:47 - know who I am or know about omz shell um
105:51 - and and so they'll come like oh I was
105:53 - talking with some because it's usually
105:54 - someone in like a different department
105:56 - it's like I'm working with someone like
105:57 - in
105:58 - some logistical part of some company and
106:00 - they're like this like this
106:01 - manufacturing company and they have like
106:03 - a fulfillment center and they're I'm
106:05 - talking with someone there and they're
106:06 - like hey we have this thing built with
106:07 - rubby on RS blah blah blah you people
106:10 - showed up in our Google searches and
106:11 - seem to be reputable um so I feel like
106:15 - we can talk about these things like I
106:16 - also have a podcast or omell is another
106:19 - thing so the thing that I I think it's
106:21 - helped the most though is we do get ref
106:24 - referrals you know we get referred from
106:26 - peers in the industry so that does end
106:28 - up being a way that we've gotten some of
106:30 - our projects over the years um where it
106:32 - might be Freelancers or some other
106:34 - agencies that are deciding to no longer
106:37 - be an agency or they maybe they got
106:38 - acquired or interesting so if an agency
106:41 - is going out of business so to speak
106:42 - then they'll they'll kind of like pass
106:43 - on their clients to you they try to like
106:45 - help them help rehome them it's like a
106:47 - natural thing like you want to if you
106:49 - have a long relationship so sometimes
106:50 - that they have like one or two big
106:52 - clients and they're like well this is
106:54 - something they've been working like we
106:55 - have we had a client that came to us or
106:57 - a company come to us a couple years ago
106:58 - with a large client that they'd work
107:00 - with for like 15 years um a couple
107:02 - different Technologies but they
107:03 - primarily use Rand rails and they're
107:05 - like yeah like the owner of the company
107:07 - had some health issues he's like I'm
107:08 - retiring closing up shop and this isn't
107:11 - like I want I want to put them in good
107:14 - hands and you you seem like you can
107:16 - probably carry them the next 10 years
107:18 - can you be that company can we can we
107:21 - trust that you they'll be in good hands
107:22 - so that stuff that that occasionally
107:24 - happens and so if you're running an
107:26 - agency you think you're getting out of
107:27 - the you know call plan Aron anyways uh
107:30 - but as far as like that the the other
107:32 - part of that the you know it was funny
107:34 - this last year I went to um a conference
107:37 - in where was it it was in Amsterdam
107:40 - called rails world and I was there I was
107:43 - I I I interviewed the rails core team
107:45 - that hosted like a panel discussion like
107:47 - an AMA thing that I I ran and I I I was
107:51 - meeting people there that knew me for
107:54 - omay Z shell and they're like why are
107:55 - you at this
107:57 - conference like why why rail it's
107:59 - interesting so so like you got your om
108:02 - my Zell like super user fans and then
108:05 - you've got your rails blog fans from
108:07 - back in the day and then you've probably
108:09 - got lots of people who you just just
108:11 - know you from your work argon right like
108:14 - so it's almost like they're like three
108:16 - different kinds of Robbie Russell fans
108:19 - yeah only like connect the dots no they
108:22 - don't connect the dots and so I was like
108:24 - at the rails conference I'm passing out
108:26 - omel stickers to people and I love that
108:30 - I mean it's like and like a lot of
108:31 - people like I didn't know you were a
108:33 - ruby developer I didn't know like I'm
108:35 - like I'm like I'm like oh Mya wouldn't
108:37 - have existed if it wasn't for the ru and
108:39 - rails Community like all of the original
108:41 - ideas came from other
108:43 - rubyists and I shared it with my Ruby on
108:45 - Rails community and they shared it and
108:47 - GitHub was written you know was written
108:49 - with Ruby Ms and it was one of the first
108:52 - big siiz project open source projects on
108:54 - GitHub early on and it's all kind of
108:57 - like connected in this weird way but
108:59 - like you know fast forward 10 15 years
109:01 - and actually yeah I think om Zell turns
109:03 - 15 years this September August or
109:06 - something so which is wild to think of
109:09 - that that's had its own lifespan but
109:11 - it's not but it was it came out of like
109:14 - a rubyan Real's developer working with
109:16 - his co-workers and wanting to have some
109:19 - consistent uh shortcuts and little
109:22 - tricks up their sleeves to to improve
109:25 - their their their efficiency and the
109:27 - command line yeah yeah awesome well
109:29 - congratulations on being able to
109:31 - interview the rails score team by the
109:32 - way that's a really cool
109:34 - honor yeah
109:36 - so we're getting toward the end of the
109:39 - podcast we've been talking for a while
109:40 - and we we've covered so much but I just
109:43 - wanted to delve a little bit more into
109:45 - your you know very interesting personal
109:47 - life like I don't have a lot of guests
109:49 - on here who are in a post rock band and
109:53 - you know play guitar and do sets and
109:55 - release albums and and they've been
109:56 - doing that for a long time maybe you
109:58 - could take a moment to just talk about
110:01 - what post rock is uh for the uninitiated
110:05 - and like what your particular band uh
110:08 - how you all approach it and maybe what
110:11 - the name means like a what is aula is it
110:15 - just like like a place or oh um so the
110:18 - band is named The Mighty moua Missoula
110:21 - okay moua I didn't pronounce it
110:23 - correctly it's a place right uh there's
110:25 - a place called Missoula Montana in the
110:28 - United States uh which is named after
110:30 - something else uh as well so so first on
110:33 - the name the the mighty Missoula is a
110:35 - reference to many many many years ago
110:38 - this before most of us were in on in
110:42 - before there were a lot of humans there
110:44 - trying to remember how many years I
110:45 - forget how many years ago it was there
110:47 - were a series of large floods that swept
110:50 - across the Pacific Northwest and helped
110:52 - carve out a lot of like the Columbia
110:54 - Gorge which if anyone doesn't know but
110:56 - the Columbia river goes Cuts between
110:58 - Oregon and Washington and quite a bit of
111:00 - Washington state is is like a massive um
111:03 - River and so there were floods that were
111:07 - basically started because there was this
111:10 - uh glacial Lake in where where is now
111:14 - like modern day like Montana where is
111:16 - this huge glacial Lake and it like I
111:18 - think it bursts through about 12 times
111:20 - and just would flood all the way almost
111:22 - all the way to the Pacific Ocean like
111:24 - that's how massive of a lake it was that
111:25 - it would just sweep across and so
111:28 - drastically impacted the a substantial
111:30 - portion of you know the United States
111:33 - was underwater at this point flooded you
111:36 - have any idea what like geological ERA
111:38 - this was like double check it's the um
111:41 - this was during during the end of the
111:43 - last ice age okay so and so when so the
111:49 - the band it's called The Mighty Missoula
111:51 - and that's a reference to these floods
111:53 - one of the ideas was like the Missoula
111:54 - floods or something like that and we
111:55 - thought that was too obvious so we went
111:57 - with the mighty missula and people could
111:59 - ask us what the name meant and we like
112:00 - well there's these floods it's a GE
112:03 - geology nerd type thing um because and
112:06 - it kind of shaped the Pacific Northwest
112:09 - um landscape quite a bit there's lots of
112:11 - areas you can see where where the
112:14 - flooding impacted there's debris and
112:16 - like huge rocks in the middle of like
112:19 - areas that do look like why is there a
112:20 - huge Boulder that's like 50 feet tall
112:23 - yeah how did I get there um because it
112:26 - was it was a rock and a big flood anyhow
112:29 - um the so the mighty miza is we're a
112:32 - post rock band in like we're basically
112:35 - we're instrumental kind of art rock band
112:38 - and post rock is a genre of music that's
112:41 - you know it's funny now it's like it was
112:43 - trying to be not kind of break some of
112:45 - the rules of standard rock music and try
112:48 - to like let you you can just like drone
112:50 - on about things and not have to follow a
112:52 - lot of super consistent formulas for how
112:54 - you write and produce your music it can
112:56 - be more ethereal
112:58 - atmospheric um I like to think about the
113:01 - music that I listen to when I'm working
113:03 - whether I'm writing code or I'm emailing
113:06 - I don't like to listen to a lot of music
113:07 - with vocals and so a lot of music that
113:10 - resonated to me and like early on in my
113:13 - you know think back it's funny music
113:15 - ends up you know being this like thing
113:17 - that you can connect to certain periods
113:18 - of your life like um I
113:21 - remember listening to like a lot of
113:23 - Boards of Canada and which is not um
113:27 - postrock but you know there was mostly
113:29 - instrumental yeah similar drum stuff
113:31 - qualities in terms of being something
113:34 - you can kind of like listen to in the
113:36 - background and it's yeah you know like
113:38 - the ambient of the 1994 everybody called
113:41 - that ambient back then right and then it
113:43 - would just feel like I guess like Apex
113:45 - Twin s ambient Works to ambient right
113:50 - exactly and so there's so like bands in
113:54 - that realm if you know couple of bands
113:56 - like sear Ro is kind of considered a
113:58 - post rock band um explosions of the sky
114:01 - from you know from down in Texas where
114:03 - you're at um MW Gods Speedy black
114:06 - Emperor you know I was listening to a
114:08 - lot of this stuff in there you know like
114:10 - 2001 2002 um got to see explosions of
114:12 - this guy the very first time they played
114:14 - at some small Club here in Portland
114:15 - Oregon and I was in a goth rock band at
114:17 - the time this was probably yeah maybe
114:20 - 3 and two or so and went to the small
114:23 - club and saw them CU I found their music
114:26 - on Napster or something and went to go
114:28 - see them play and I remember thinking
114:30 - they're a band without vocals how
114:31 - interesting could that be and I went
114:34 - there and I was like this was like one
114:35 - of the most engaging shows I've ever
114:37 - been to I was like just enamored by what
114:39 - was happening how I felt with the music
114:41 - and I was like and I was in a band that
114:43 - didn't really like my singer all that
114:45 - much and the drummer or the bass player
114:46 - and I had talked about like it'd be cool
114:48 - we always like when we're just jamming
114:49 - on stuff before the rest of the band
114:51 - gets there and we start working on our
114:53 - music like like just noodling on things
114:54 - like let's start our own project so I my
114:57 - first post rock band was back then it
114:59 - was called the vacant we did that for a
115:00 - couple years and then Planet argon took
115:02 - off and the Bas player she got pregnant
115:04 - and our lives kind of went a different
115:06 - direction and then so for years I wasn't
115:08 - really playing music but um about I
115:11 - think maybe going back like seven no
115:13 - probably like nine years ago now I think
115:16 - I was like looking at my equipment and
115:17 - occasionally playing with my guitar I
115:19 - was like I need to collaborate with
115:21 - people
115:22 - again and and so I didn't feel like I
115:25 - was progressing personally by just
115:27 - playing like I'm like oh I'll work on my
115:29 - own music and right stuff I play a
115:31 - couple different instrument I can't do
115:32 - drums or anything but I can at least
115:34 - make some interesting ambian type music
115:36 - with guitar and some bass and stuff like
115:38 - that and some synths and such but I was
115:41 - like no I want to work on a project with
115:42 - other people and like let's see what
115:43 - comes out so posted out on
115:46 - Craigslist you know found a drummer
115:48 - found a bass player over appear time
115:50 - start putting together a band we you
115:52 - know we start writing some songs we pick
115:53 - a name we record an EP and then our
115:56 - drummer moves away for for journalism
116:00 - school I have to find a new drummer and
116:02 - then like he has different skill sets
116:04 - can do a lot more recording stuff as
116:05 - well we our skill set drastically
116:07 - improves our WR songwriting evolves
116:10 - write another album then the pandemic
116:12 - happens we're stuck at home we during
116:15 - the pandemic we were we our album
116:18 - release so we printed vinyl we were
116:20 - releasing our album April 2020 we were
116:23 - planning like our you know launch show
116:25 - you know album release made vinyl we
116:28 - were super proud of this thing we're
116:29 - like we're going to put together a tour
116:31 - that
116:32 - summer we're all stuck at home um okay
116:35 - maybe not and so then during that
116:39 - period we IID wanted to work on some
116:41 - more ambient stuff like let's strip away
116:43 - the drums our drummer can do a lot of s
116:46 - and and soundscaping type stuff so like
116:49 - we we all stuck at our home so we
116:50 - decided we would make an ambient album
116:53 - and we would pass files around the cloud
116:55 - it was all cloud-based themed um so we
116:58 - did that as a way to continue writing
117:00 - together and build up some new skills
117:01 - during that period and that way we knew
117:03 - that when we got back together post
117:05 - coming out of you the the next album
117:07 - that we're working which we just
117:08 - finished recording a month ago and we're
117:10 - now in the the final mixing stages right
117:12 - now so that'll be released sometime this
117:14 - summer um so that was pretty exciting
117:16 - and last year we got to go play a
117:18 - festival in the postre f in Indianapolis
117:20 - so we did a tour across the country to
117:22 - that and back and played a lot of shows
117:24 - with anywhere from four people in the
117:27 - audience to you know several dozen you
117:29 - know type of thing to playing at the
117:31 - festival with like hundreds of people
117:32 - there and that was pretty exciting but
117:34 - yeah it was it I'm kind of I kind of
117:36 - look at it as like it's it's a hobby I'm
117:39 - not this isn't going to be my career by
117:40 - any
117:41 - means who knows but it's kind of like a
117:44 - little bit feels like cosplay sometimes
117:46 - um like it's like we're banned we're
117:48 - we're doing this fun stuff but like it's
117:50 - a fun hobby and and it keeps me you know
117:53 - out of the house a couple days a week to
117:54 - go work with other people on and it's
117:56 - not my project it's our project I might
117:58 - have posted the original Craigslist ad
118:00 - and so I think in some ways I'm like the
118:02 - leader a little bit I have that project
118:03 - management skill set but I'm not but
118:05 - it's our band it's like yeah do you ever
118:07 - have to like kind of like suppress your
118:11 - manager I mean you're a CEO so like
118:13 - you're used to like figuring out what
118:14 - needs to be done and like listening to
118:16 - everybody's opinions and then making a
118:18 - decision and people are expecting to go
118:19 - along with it that that doesn't really
118:21 - work in your band though right like is
118:22 - it more democratic or or are you
118:25 - somewhat autocratic it is it's it's a
118:27 - lot more democratic sometimes we'll have
118:29 - conversations like who cares the most
118:31 - about this particular decision there's
118:34 - you know I gu like our our drummer I
118:36 - mentioned has like a lot more he went to
118:38 - school and he has a background in in uh
118:42 - Sound Engineering so like things on that
118:44 - realm we kind of defer to him to help
118:45 - make a lot of decisions and kind of
118:47 - guide us and teach us through it but he
118:48 - also has a really good knack for being a
118:50 - good producer which is you know and and
118:53 - that's and someone that can help unblock
118:56 - us or help like when you're recording
118:58 - something in front of other people and
119:00 - you're trying to figure it out it's like
119:02 - I think I think about music I think
119:03 - everybody has this idea that you write
119:04 - the music and it's all perfect and
119:06 - you're going to play it the same way
119:07 - every single time and it's like that's
119:08 - not what happens I just watched Quincy
119:11 - do the uh intro song like three times um
119:14 - and they all sound a little bit they all
119:15 - sounded great three different times um
119:17 - different ways and that's that's the way
119:18 - it works so like sometimes you're kind
119:21 - of like you don't remember how you did
119:23 - something or it doesn't quite feel the
119:24 - same when you actually go to record it
119:26 - and and like someone has an idea like no
119:28 - do it the way you did it originally and
119:29 - you're like I don't and there's there's
119:31 - a performance aspect as well it's like
119:34 - sometimes I want to play the Baseline
119:35 - just like it was on the record but maybe
119:39 - mechanically like I get tripped up by
119:41 - some sort of like jump or something like
119:42 - that yeah and uh yeah so can't reproduce
119:47 - everything and yeah you don't
119:48 - necessarily want to that's why people
119:49 - are you know still bootlegging grateful
119:52 - Day concerts uh I mean how many concerts
119:54 - have they done and there's probably a
119:56 - recording of pretty much every single
119:58 - recording and fans will listen to all
120:01 - the different versions of like very
120:03 - similar kind of like I guess and jazz is
120:07 - an entire art based around the notion of
120:09 - having like kind of like a motif if you
120:11 - will and then like diving into you know
120:15 - jamming
120:17 - essentially it's true the um
120:20 - it's just that's the thing about so to
120:22 - answer your question yeah I don't feel
120:23 - like I have to put my CEO in hat very
120:25 - often I mean I'm usually the one that's
120:26 - like over looking finances for the band
120:29 - and like dealing with some of like the
120:31 - the paperwork when we're negotiating
120:33 - some stuff for like a a festival or
120:35 - shows or something like that but um but
120:38 - otherwise yeah everything else is very
120:40 - collaborative and and and I kind of like
120:42 - let them drive a lot more of some of the
120:44 - songw writing I might have like some
120:45 - guitar ideas I have and but they're
120:47 - definitely I'm surrounded myself with
120:49 - people that are much better musicians
120:51 - and so I get to kind of grow with them
120:53 - which is a thing that I appreciate about
120:56 - like the types of projects that I do
120:57 - like you mentioned omell the thing about
120:59 - omell it's like I might have planted
121:02 - this flag once upon a time that here's
121:04 - this kind of concept and the structure I
121:07 - have and then and immediately I was like
121:10 - please contribute and now we've had over
121:12 - 2,000 people contribute code to the
121:15 - project and so I'm just like it's it's
121:18 - become what it is because of the people
121:20 - that decided they wanted to participate
121:22 - and they felt like they could and maybe
121:24 - I made it easier for people to
121:26 - contribute in some way or at least made
121:28 - it inviting and that that's helped you
121:30 - know after we finish this I'm going to
121:31 - hop over to an omell maintainer meeting
121:33 - with the two other people that help
121:34 - maintain the project and I've never met
121:37 - them in person yet actually hoping to do
121:39 - that in a few months actually um but
121:42 - it's just like I I just Sur and that's
121:44 - why I don't I didn't like being a
121:46 - consultant an early era Contracting
121:49 - thing you know outside of my you know I
121:52 - mentioned my partner that was a designer
121:53 - we would work collaboratively but I
121:54 - didn't really get to feel like I was up
121:56 - leveling as a developer because I wasn't
121:58 - really working with a lot of other peer
122:00 - developers very often just kind of like
122:01 - figuring things out myself and so I felt
122:03 - like I've excelled the more that I've
122:05 - leaned into working on projects that
122:07 - involved other people to help get the
122:09 - thing done and other skill sets people
122:11 - that were better programmers or deeper
122:12 - programmers in certain things and there
122:14 - was Project managers and there was a
122:15 - designer and there's and the
122:17 - collaborative aspect of working with the
122:18 - client or other people to bounce ideas
122:20 - off of and like to review my code or for
122:23 - me to review someone else's
122:25 - code that's that's the world I like to
122:27 - live in and so like we'll talk to a lot
122:29 - of people that are
122:30 - Freelancers and I'm like I don't
122:32 - understand that that world like how
122:35 - you've decided that that's the thing you
122:36 - want to do I'm like what's wrong with
122:37 - you why don't you trust people U I'm
122:40 - kind of jokingly saying that and and
122:43 - it's like but what what is it that
122:44 - you're like I want to just go do my own
122:46 - thing and maybe and that's like an
122:48 - interesting thing for me to wrap my head
122:50 - around because that doesn't make sense
122:51 - to my brain but I um so even though I
122:55 - thought I wanted to DIY it it was always
122:57 - about like I wanted to do my thing but I
123:00 - didn't think that it was going to become
123:02 - this thing with employees as soon as I
123:04 - had that around me I was like oh how
123:06 - could I do this any other way this is
123:08 - way better yeah well so to some extent
123:12 - your DIY spirit is like a victim of his
123:14 - own
123:15 - success a little bit Yeah Yeah well uh I
123:19 - just have one closing question uh
123:20 - because you know Portland seems to be
123:23 - like a really key aspect of your life
123:25 - you know you chose to move there you've
123:27 - stayed there much longer than I've ever
123:28 - lived in any one city um
123:31 - and if somebody's going to Portland for
123:34 - the first
123:35 - time what is something they hands down
123:37 - should
123:38 - consider taking a day to
123:41 - do if they're
123:44 - able-bodied to leave Portland and go out
123:47 - to the gorge and go on some hikes or a
123:50 - hike somewhere there's a couple great gr
123:52 - hikes feel free to write me I'll give
123:53 - you a list of a couple things depending
123:55 - on your I would say your ability to
123:58 - threshold of how much pain you want to
124:00 - endure or not um so that I mean there
124:02 - really like so much of like the thing I
124:03 - love about Portland is so close like 30
124:06 - minutes away and you can be hiking in
124:08 - some pretty gorgeous areas
124:11 - um reminds me that early on there was a
124:13 - rails conference we we we shuttled a
124:16 - couple buses we rented some bus charter
124:18 - buses and we took a bunch of Ruby on
124:19 - Rails developers hiking one afternoon as
124:23 - a way to like let's go do this and like
124:24 - let's show you outside but if you're in
124:26 - Portland one thing that I would do like
124:29 - inside the city is honestly I think just
124:33 - like you know it's like cliche to like
124:36 - talk about if I like wandering the
124:38 - coffee roasies and getting to check out
124:40 - different coffee shops and stuff like
124:41 - that something I enjoy doing in any City
124:43 - so maybe it's I feel like that was more
124:46 - of a thing more of a Portland thing
124:48 - early in the air and so I still think
124:49 - about that which kind of just got me
124:51 - excited when every time I travel now I'm
124:52 - like I want to go find the coffee
124:53 - roaster STS and try coffee but that was
124:56 - more I feel like that still leans on
124:57 - being kind of slightly more of a
124:59 - Portland origin type of thing so I think
125:02 - checking out some of those old coffee
125:04 - roasteries is a thing and is there a
125:06 - specific
125:07 - Street a specific Street where like a
125:09 - lot of them are collocated or no they
125:13 - they're all kind of around now um like
125:16 - the what ends up happening is like the
125:17 - places that are on the
125:20 - the more popular streets they might turn
125:22 - into chains and
125:24 - then it depends like I don't want people
125:27 - to judge me because I'm like oh Haw ha's
125:29 - ha's still cute um but I'm like actually
125:32 - I don't know if any of the roasteries
125:34 - there are the like actual roasteries
125:37 - over there right now so they're all kind
125:38 - of like scattered a little bit okay but
125:40 - Hawthorne is like a destination that a
125:42 - lot of people might like if you're a
125:44 - total Portland novice and you're just
125:46 - looking for a single word remember
125:49 - Hawthorne it sounds like is uh get hop
125:52 - in the the taxi take me to Uber uh take
125:55 - take me to Hawthorne and stuff on it
125:57 - right exactly that and Andor uh and then
126:00 - hit the pals on Hawthorne but if you
126:01 - have time go downtown and go to the big
126:03 - PALS like that's still our our
126:05 - independent bookstore there is PALS huge
126:08 - so definitely spend hours there awesome
