00:00 - in this course you'll learn the basics
00:01 - of gdau for game development this course
00:05 - is perfect for Unity developers
00:07 - transitioning to gdau but it will also
00:10 - help people who are new to game
00:11 - development in General Omar Zaki teaches
00:14 - this course he is an experienced game
00:17 - developer and has created many popular
00:19 - good old courses you'll learn how to
00:22 - navigate the interface and build a
00:24 - simple Flappy Bird
00:26 - game hi my name is Omar and I assume
00:30 - most of you guys at least close to the
00:32 - update of this video are here because of
00:35 - unity um a lot of you guys are quitting
00:37 - unity and have decided to pick up gdau
00:40 - and so I have made this video lengthy
00:43 - video it's about an hour long to help
00:45 - you transition into gdau this video is
00:49 - not how to become a game developer it
00:53 - does cover some basic topics of game
00:56 - development however this video is mainly
01:00 - focused on introducing you to the gdau
01:03 - engine not GDOT whatever they say it is
01:06 - gdau um so I hope you enjoy and I hope
01:10 - you learn as much as possible from this
01:11 - video this video definitely will not
01:14 - cover most the nodes it is mainly just
01:17 - how to navigate the interface of gdau
01:20 - and how to actually get started on your
01:22 - project hopefully um your transition
01:25 - from Unity to gdau is not too brutal or
01:28 - if you're not even transitioning your
01:30 - just picking up gdau and want to learn
01:32 - game development this is the right place
01:34 - for you this again is a complete
01:36 - beginner video just how to pick up gdau
01:39 - so I hope you guys enjoy this video and
01:42 - I will see you at the end of the video
01:44 - our first step is going to be to get
01:46 - familiar with the gdau engine and
01:49 - actually making sure we have all the
01:50 - assets we need so here we have our
01:53 - Flappy Bird assets and we also have the
01:54 - goo engine uh executable file so here
01:59 - here was my Z file for that I'm going to
02:01 - delete that I'm going to extract this we
02:05 - have our file here I'm going to delete
02:07 - this we're going to launch the gdau
02:09 - executable we're going to create a new
02:12 - project I'm going to browse it and put
02:14 - it in my
02:16 - desktop going to name this fory
02:20 - bird YouTube
02:23 - tutorial here on the left we have three
02:26 - different kind of renderers now for 2D
02:29 - usually I use compatibility for 3D you
02:32 - would most likely want to use forward
02:34 - and mobile is well for mobile for very
02:37 - less Advanced 3D Graphics um as you can
02:39 - see there's a little uh description of
02:41 - what everything does so let's select
02:44 - none for the Version Control because I'm
02:46 - not going to put this on GitHub I'm
02:48 - going to now create folder because we
02:50 - see here it gives me an error and is
02:51 - telling me to create a folder now I can
02:55 - create an
02:56 - edit and here we have our fresh project
02:59 - project now let's take a look at our
03:02 - interface here on the left we see we
03:05 - have the file system this is where all
03:07 - the files that we create with scripts
03:10 - and scenes and anything else will appear
03:13 - this is also where we will be importing
03:16 - our file soon on the top left we see
03:20 - create node now this will change in a
03:22 - bit however this is where the node
03:25 - structure will generally be this is
03:27 - where I edit and change my scene we can
03:31 - also see the import tab is also on the
03:33 - top left and we have a few other uh
03:36 - settings on the top above that now in
03:39 - the middle as we can see a giant screen
03:42 - we see the project tab this is where we
03:47 - see the actual scene and on the top
03:49 - right above that we can actually change
03:51 - it to 2D now on the right hand side we
03:54 - have inspector node and history this is
03:58 - the inspector but it's also Al the
04:00 - property panel usually so when I change
04:02 - a node or an object in my game the
04:06 - properties will be on the right hand
04:08 - side on the bottom we have a bunch of
04:11 - other useful things as such as output
04:14 - debugger audio animation and Shader
04:18 - editor there's going to be a few other
04:20 - things that might pop up depending on
04:22 - what node you're using for example tile
04:25 - map or tile set can add an extra thing
04:28 - which we will be doing in this
04:30 - video output is usually for things like
04:33 - print which we will also be looking at
04:35 - in a bit all right so at this point we
04:38 - want to actually import all our assets
04:41 - so we're going to minimize the screen
04:44 - like this and we're going to find our
04:46 - folder so here is our Flappy Bird folder
04:49 - assets all we have to do it's really
04:51 - easy we just take it and drag it into
04:54 - our screen if we make sure we select
04:58 - this drag it and put it into our folder
05:01 - it's going to say res we just drag and
05:03 - drop it and it should import now we
05:07 - might instantly see a problem now the
05:10 - first problem we
05:11 - see I'm going to drag one of these
05:14 - pictures onto my screen it's going to
05:16 - turn into a Sprite on the top left here
05:20 - we see the icon for the Sprite and if I
05:22 - select it by clicking it on the right we
05:26 - see that it says Sprite 2D now if if I
05:29 - zoom in we can see it's kind of blurred
05:33 - so in order to fix this we have to
05:36 - change the properties of this now what
05:40 - we can do I
05:41 - believe in texture sorry here we go in
05:45 - the texture property we will go to the
05:48 - filter and select nearest now if I zoom
05:53 - in we can see it has become
05:55 - pixelated however I don't want to do
05:58 - this every time I import and or add a
06:01 - Sprite so we're going to set the default
06:04 - now here by default if we actually
06:06 - reselect this and click the loop it'll
06:09 - say inherit now what does inherit mean
06:11 - inherit is going to inherit the default
06:15 - project settings now if we go to the top
06:17 - left and click project settings or
06:20 - project we see project settings if we
06:23 - click that we'll go
06:25 - to down here we can actually just search
06:28 - up fil
06:30 - filter and we should find rendering
06:32 - Textures in the textures we'll find
06:35 - default texture filter at the moment it
06:38 - is set to linear we want nearest we
06:42 - close this we now see if we zoom in it
06:46 - has become pixelated and the filter on
06:48 - the right did not have to
06:50 - change now the advantage of this is if I
06:53 - delete that and add another uh PNG we
06:58 - can see that it is proper ly pixelated
07:00 - and not blurry well the background is
07:02 - blurry but that's just how the
07:03 - background is so I'm going to delete
07:04 - this and now we have imported out our
07:08 - assets and we have set the project
07:12 - setting now let's go back into our
07:14 - project
07:15 - settings and we're going to actually
07:17 - change the window so let's clear the
07:21 - search we'll go to window display on the
07:24 - left and we're going to actually switch
07:26 - this to divided by 3 and then divide
07:29 - this by three and then we're actually
07:31 - going to switch these so this is going
07:32 - to be 384 and this is going to be
07:36 - 216 so let's make sure we have these and
07:40 - on the stretch we're going to go to the
07:42 - mode and keep it as viewport and then
07:45 - aspect we're going to
07:47 - expand and now we'll close this and now
07:51 - we see that our blue window has changed
07:54 - now this is essentially a camera if I
07:57 - were to play nothing's going to happen
07:58 - cuz we don't even have a scene yet but
08:01 - we'll actually do that right now so
08:03 - let's go to create root node we'll
08:05 - create a 2d scene because we want a 2d
08:08 - game we need a 2d node as the paper what
08:13 - that we draw on essentially this is
08:15 - going to be a piece of paper that we
08:16 - actually draw on and add Sprites and
08:19 - nodes and other things to it so let's
08:22 - contrl s to save I'm going to name this
08:25 - file world and we see that it is saved
08:27 - as a TS
08:29 - CN this stands for scene we also see
08:33 - here that it's going to be recognized as
08:35 - other things but we just need it as
08:38 - tscn we'll save this and now on the left
08:41 - we see world.
08:43 - TCN has been saved and if I click it
08:46 - this opens right it's already open but
08:49 - that's okay now if I click play run
08:51 - project or F5 we can select or select
08:55 - current select we'll open this folder
08:58 - and we can select this to open it and
09:01 - now we see our folder or our screen is
09:05 - right here now if we want to change the
09:07 - actual size of that screen that just
09:10 - appeared we can go back to project
09:12 - settings and instead of switching the
09:14 - viewport and width we're actually going
09:17 - to select advanced
09:19 - settings and here on the
09:22 - bottom below the viewport width I'm
09:25 - going to copy this and here under all
09:28 - the way at the bottom we see window
09:29 - width override now this is going to be
09:32 - overriding the actual screen we see this
09:34 - is essentially the pixel size that we
09:37 - see and play with in our screen so make
09:40 - sure we take a look at the top right
09:43 - here we see that this screen is
09:46 - approximately 250 technically it's 216
09:49 - that's what we set it to however if we
09:51 - go to the window width override and
09:54 - multiply it by maybe two and then go to
09:57 - the height width override and then
09:59 - multiply this by two we now have these
10:02 - settings and if I click close this did
10:05 - not change however if I click play our
10:08 - screen is now a lot bigger so that's all
10:10 - the override does if you were making a
10:13 - mobile game for example this would not
10:15 - matter because on a mobile game the
10:18 - screen will automatically resize to the
10:21 - Android screen you have or the iOS
10:24 - screen on Windows this matters more
10:26 - because that is the window that we
10:28 - actually play on
10:29 - now I will let you play around with
10:31 - these values do whatever you like but
10:34 - these are the settings I'm going to work
10:36 - with now one additional thing if you
10:39 - accidentally select a different scene to
10:42 - play automatically here we have run
10:45 - project this will play the project
10:47 - completely from scratch from the very
10:49 - first scene now let's create another
10:52 - scene let's create this scene just for
10:55 - the sake of having it so I'll save this
10:57 - as node 2D if I right click this H here
11:00 - we go now we have this that says set as
11:03 - main scene so now if I play it looks the
11:06 - same but it's now going to be running
11:08 - the node 2D instead of the world and I I
11:12 - can actually confirm this by going to
11:14 - the left when I play I See remote and
11:17 - local local is the local things that I
11:21 - edit the remote is the live version here
11:24 - we have root and it also says node 2D we
11:28 - can confirm this by saying by hovering
11:30 - it and it says instance node 2D it shows
11:33 - us the file path now this is because we
11:36 - have set this to play this on the main
11:40 - now I can stop this by clicking this on
11:42 - the top right or by clicking f8 now I'm
11:45 - going to close the node 2D go back to my
11:48 - world and now I'm also going to rename
11:50 - the node 2D to world all right let's get
11:55 - started in actually creating something
11:58 - so the first thing I'm going going to
11:59 - introduce is something called rigid body
12:02 - 2D now in order to add objects into our
12:07 - game unlike Unity or some other engines
12:11 - you might have used everything is
12:14 - already essentially preset now in order
12:17 - to add that specific object you want we
12:19 - go to the top left under scene and click
12:23 - this plus button or contrl
12:25 - a now we have this window that says
12:29 - create new node and all these nodes are
12:32 - essentially objects here we can see the
12:35 - node 2D and it's actually organized
12:37 - quite
12:38 - nicely most the things that are 2D will
12:41 - be under the node 2D if I click this I
12:45 - can see a bunch of 2D objects now
12:49 - instead of just looking through all this
12:51 - I'm just going to use the search bar I'm
12:53 - going to search up rigid body now if I
12:56 - click the
12:57 - X it doesn't select it so I'm GNA
13:00 - actually find it for the sake of
13:03 - introducing just bodies here we go it's
13:06 - in the Collision object
13:07 - 2D so here in the Collision object 2D we
13:11 - see that we have physics body 2D we have
13:15 - static body character body and rigid
13:17 - body 2D now rigid body is used for
13:22 - things like balls or things that need
13:25 - physic uh physics simulation right so I
13:28 - think the classic example is a ball
13:32 - because a lot of engines like to compare
13:34 - those kind of uh physics and I will just
13:37 - say right off the bat if just in case
13:40 - you are from Unity one of the main
13:42 - differences that at least I'm aware of
13:44 - of the rigid body 2D in good and just
13:48 - not even 2D but just rigid body the 3D
13:51 - as well versus Unity is that the rigid
13:55 - body in uh gdau actually Sim simulates a
14:00 - real ball so when you drop a real ball
14:03 - generally it has momentum and it stops
14:07 - eventually whereas in unity the ball
14:10 - will keep bouncing to the same height
14:12 - whereas in goo it'll eventually stop and
14:16 - get to the ground essentially now we're
14:18 - going to create this by selecting the
14:20 - rigid body 2D and create now here on the
14:24 - left we see rigid body 2D but we also
14:26 - have an air on the right now if I hover
14:29 - this it's going to tell us we just need
14:31 - a collision shape so let's do that let's
14:33 - control a or add a node and we're just
14:36 - going to search up Collision shape now
14:39 - we have a lot of collisions we need a
14:41 - collision shape 2D Collision polygon can
14:43 - also work but Collision shape is a
14:45 - little easier so let's add that now
14:48 - let's zoom in to this point because
14:50 - that's where it is we can see it by
14:52 - either hovering or just selecting it in
14:54 - general it's already selected now if I
14:57 - give it a shape on the right
14:59 - I'm going to select a circle shape
15:00 - because my bird is going to be a circle
15:04 - now we can see there's not really
15:06 - anything here so let's add our player so
15:09 - let's go to the left on our files and
15:12 - add our player so we have three birds we
15:13 - can add from I'm going to add the red
15:15 - one we can see that it's automatically
15:17 - turned into a Sprite now in gdau there
15:20 - are quite a few ways to animate things
15:22 - so this gives quite a bit of flexibility
15:25 - in how we want to do things so we can
15:28 - either go to animation here and type in
15:31 - the H frame 4 if we do that it'll take
15:34 - the frames that we had and turn it into
15:36 - this now there's something called
15:38 - animation player which I'm not going to
15:40 - get into but that will it's actually a
15:42 - very powerful tool in gdo that helps us
15:45 - animate various
15:47 - things so if I wanted to animate from 0
15:50 - 1 to 3 for frame it could do that
15:54 - however I'm going to do an E easier
15:56 - method and I'm going to use something
15:58 - called animated Sprite so I'm going to
16:01 - go to my rigid body select my rigid body
16:03 - I'm going to add a node and search up
16:06 - animated Sprite we see animated Sprite
16:09 - 2D let's
16:11 - create here it's basically telling us we
16:14 - need to create a Sprite frame so on the
16:16 - right let's go to Animation Sprite
16:19 - frames new Sprite frames click this and
16:23 - here we have a new selection on the
16:26 - bottom that says Sprite frames now here
16:28 - it says default but I can double click
16:30 - this and rename it to
16:34 - fly now here it's already automatically
16:37 - looped but here we have no frames so
16:39 - let's add some stuff now you could drag
16:43 - and drop but this adds a frame this is
16:45 - frame zero that's not exactly what we
16:47 - want so let's delete that what we want
16:49 - to do is we want to add these four
16:51 - frames into this as separate frames and
16:54 - luckily enough good can do that if we
16:56 - click this rectangle but button little
16:59 - thing we'll find that this pops up and
17:02 - we can find our Sprite that we want to
17:06 - add I'm going to do the blue one
17:07 - actually and if we zoom in by holding
17:10 - control and zoom
17:11 - in able to zoom in and on the right side
17:15 - used to actually be on the top but they
17:16 - changed it so it's on the right I
17:18 - actually don't like that I like it on
17:19 - the top but that's okay we're going to
17:21 - go to horizontal and select one nope
17:24 - sorry four and then vertical we'll do
17:27 - zero or one so now we can select all
17:30 - these and we can see that the numbers
17:32 - actually correlate to the order so if I
17:35 - did this it would be a different order
17:37 - now we can just unselect it all and then
17:39 - select all and it'll do it like that
17:41 - that's probably a bit easier so select
17:43 - all on the top or select none and then
17:45 - select all so make sure we have select
17:48 - all and we add all four frames and now
17:50 - we see all four frames have been added
17:53 - now I can play test this by just
17:54 - clicking this play
17:55 - button and it automatically loops now
17:58 - what I'm going to do is I'm actually
18:00 - going to automatically play
18:03 - this that way it plays on when I play
18:07 - the game now if I run the
18:10 - project nothing is really going to show
18:12 - up so what I'm going to do is I'm
18:13 - actually going to take my rigid body and
18:15 - I'm going to move all of it by instead
18:17 - of clicking and dragging you can see
18:19 - here I've only moved the Sprite what I
18:22 - can do is either there's a lot of
18:24 - options I can either take these two by
18:27 - holding one of them and then shift and
18:30 - selecting the other or control and then
18:32 - I can lock it and now I can select my
18:35 - rigid body or if I don't want to do that
18:38 - which I usually don't I can just select
18:40 - my rigid body I can click this guy the
18:43 - move mode or W and now I can just move
18:46 - the rigid body from anywhere it's a lot
18:48 - easier to move things around now if I
18:52 - play again nothing that's very
18:55 - interesting let's find out what's happen
18:58 - happening most likely it's just falling
19:01 - before we can even see it
19:03 - so let's go to the remote and see what's
19:06 - happening oh I see what's happening
19:08 - we're not playing the correct thing so
19:10 - let's make sure we select this as the
19:12 - main scene and I'm going to delete the
19:14 - other node that I
19:17 - made there we go there's our birdie and
19:20 - as we saw it automatically Falls it has
19:22 - its own built-in physics and gravity
19:24 - that it just automatically Falls we can
19:27 - find it by going to the by selecting the
19:29 - rigid body 2D and going to the right
19:32 - side with the properties panel we see
19:34 - linear and angular velocity we're going
19:37 - to actually play with both of these in
19:38 - our script in a bit so I'm going to
19:40 - unselect those we don't want to select
19:42 - anything here we see the transform this
19:45 - just shows us the position rotation
19:47 - scale and skew skew is actually new in
19:49 - gdau so if you would like to play around
19:51 - with that you can see what it does it's
19:53 - kind of
19:54 - interesting but I'm going to leave it at
19:57 - zero um um we're not going to really
19:59 - play them around with too much so now
20:02 - what we're going to do is we're going to
20:03 - actually add a script to our bird so
20:06 - let's actually rename this to
20:09 - bird then add a script as you might
20:12 - assumed the script is up here on the
20:15 - right or on the left sorry with the
20:17 - little paper thing that says has a plus
20:19 - button if I click that it'll prompt me
20:21 - to attach a note now there's a few
20:23 - options the language I could change
20:26 - before there used to be um
20:29 - don't remember what it was called but it
20:31 - was like another GD thing um but either
20:33 - way you can also I believe import C into
20:38 - gdo um I don't know how to do that I've
20:40 - never tried it I've never done it but
20:42 - there are videos out there that you can
20:44 - find that will allow you to do that if
20:46 - you prefer C over GD script now I will
20:50 - give a not warning but I guess just a
20:54 - general knowledge thing is that GD
20:56 - script is basically python if you know
20:59 - python or if you have an inkling of what
21:01 - python how python works you'll be fine
21:03 - GD script is very similar to python it's
21:06 - essentially the same but GD script just
21:08 - has its own builtin functions which is
21:11 - very useful which we're going to be
21:12 - taking advantage of now we see here the
21:15 - inherits this will actually see what
21:17 - this does in a minute when I create this
21:19 - but what also matters is the template
21:22 - and the built-in script template is
21:24 - actually new which is cool there's no
21:26 - template real template for the bird or
21:29 - the rigid body however for some other
21:31 - nodes there are some templates but
21:34 - either way we're going to leave this as
21:35 - node default for the built-in script
21:38 - this if I select it essentially I cannot
21:42 - find the script in my files it is a
21:44 - built-in script into this node usually
21:48 - that's not what you want to do
21:51 - because if I create this let's create it
21:54 - here we go if I hit control shift f I
21:58 - can find anything in my file so for
22:00 - example let's say
22:02 - rigid it will now show me on the bottom
22:05 - the find rigid and it'll show me the
22:08 - things that have rigid in it now if I
22:11 - had made it built in so let's actually
22:13 - take this out and delete this script if
22:16 - I do the same thing make it built in and
22:19 - let's go to
22:21 - output and then say rigid nothing shows
22:24 - up because it's builtin it's a buil-in
22:26 - script that we cannot search through our
22:28 - files so let's make sure that we have it
22:30 - not built in and create and here we have
22:34 - on the right left as well we have an
22:36 - unsaved thing this is just the the other
22:39 - built-in script it's a little wanky
22:41 - sometimes but we're just going to use
22:43 - this all right so in our script we want
22:47 - to take a look at the code that we have
22:50 - so far because right now it's not much
22:54 - but what's Happening Here is it's going
22:56 - to extend the rigid body 2D
22:58 - which is basically a class which is
23:00 - rigid body 2D that looks like my headset
23:03 - is low but I'll charge that in a minute
23:05 - here we have two functions the ready
23:07 - function it's called when the node
23:08 - enters the scene and we have the process
23:11 - function which is very useful but we're
23:12 - not going to use that just yet we're
23:15 - going to create a new function called
23:17 - function input event this is a function
23:21 - that checks for any sort of event so if
23:24 - I print the
23:26 - event and I go to output on the bottom
23:29 - left and I play my
23:31 - game and I start moving my mouse or even
23:34 - clicking a button on my keyboard
23:37 - anything this is any sort of event now
23:40 - the question becomes how do I specify
23:43 - this to a certain type of thing well I
23:46 - can say if event is input event Mouse
23:51 - button then we'll print the event now
23:55 - this is what this is going to do is if I
23:57 - restart the game
23:59 - it will only take something if I click
24:02 - even if I move my mouse it won't input
24:04 - that because that's not a mouse button
24:06 - it is a motion so if I actually control
24:09 - and left click on this it will go bring
24:13 - me to the input Mouse button um document
24:17 - and I can even click the online document
24:18 - I won't now there's also the search help
24:21 - and we can kind of look at what this
24:23 - stuff has I'm not going to I'm going I
24:26 - already know so I'm going to teach you
24:29 - so when I look in my game let's restart
24:32 - this if I left click we see that the
24:36 - button index is one and the button mask
24:38 - is one and zero that means I click down
24:41 - so if I click down once and then release
24:44 - the button mask is zero if I right click
24:46 - the button index is two so now we can
24:49 - actually check for which button I'm
24:52 - clicking on my mouse and I can do that
24:54 - by saying if event. button index is
24:58 - equal to one so we're taking the event
25:01 - and looking for a property button index
25:04 - is a property of the event so the event
25:08 - here is the thing that I printed so this
25:11 - is the entire event but I only want the
25:13 - button index and I do that by saying
25:16 - button index similarly we can do event
25:20 - Doods or press or anything else you can
25:24 - even check the position by doing event.
25:27 - position
25:28 - okay so now we want to add linear
25:33 - velocity to our player every time I
25:36 - click now how can I do that well there's
25:39 - something called linear
25:42 - velocity however you'll see in a second
25:45 - so if we want to change the Y maybe
25:48 - let's subtract
25:52 - 150 so in Gau when we add or subtract to
25:57 - the Y y AIS the Y AIS is actually
26:00 - negative in the upwards Direction so if
26:02 - I look very closely on the left we can
26:05 - see that this says 50 here and if I go
26:07 - up a little bit this says 50 so I want
26:10 - my bird to go upwards when I click and I
26:14 - do that by subtracting 150 now let's try
26:18 - this oh that's a little weird that's not
26:20 - exactly what I want so what we're going
26:23 - to do is we actually setting it like
26:27 - this is very strange now every node not
26:33 - every node but most nodes have a a
26:37 - builtin function for these type of
26:39 - things now this one is set do linear
26:44 - well set linear velocity to this
26:47 - velocity now I can't just pass through
26:49 - ay I have to give it a vector 2 so
26:52 - Vector 2 is just an x and y coordinate
26:54 - now the X I don't want it to move in the
26:56 - X Direction because that's right and
26:58 - left I only want it to go upwards of 150
27:02 - now calling self is the same as not
27:04 - calling self so if I do this it's the
27:07 - same as saying self dot I just like to
27:10 - get into the habit of doing self Dot and
27:13 - then the function just so it's a good
27:15 - habit so that way you see what all these
27:17 - things are doing to what right so now we
27:20 - know that we're setting the self to the
27:22 - linear velocity now if I
27:25 - play we can see we have a little bit of
27:27 - jump it's a little better than it used
27:29 - to be now to make this a bit more fun
27:32 - we're going to do the same thing but
27:34 - we're going to say set angular velocity
27:37 - to negative maybe let's change this to
27:39 - negative one and see what that looks
27:41 - like and now you can see our bird is
27:44 - kind of flipping I think I'll keep it
27:47 - tog3 so it's a little
27:49 - quicker now we can see our bird is
27:51 - flipping like that so it looks a little
27:54 - cooler okay we also
27:58 - you also have the option of playing the
28:02 - fly animation only when you click so to
28:05 - do that we can go to our animated Sprite
28:08 - make sure it's selected we have it here
28:09 - on the bottom we're going to turn off
28:11 - the autoplay and we're going to turn off
28:14 - the loop now what we can do is we can
28:17 - take our animated Sprite and drag it
28:20 - into our script and it gives us the path
28:23 - to our script now what does this do this
28:26 - essentially gives us access to the
28:28 - animated
28:29 - Sprite so now what I can do is I can
28:31 - call something from that and I'm going
28:34 - to say play Fly it's going to play this
28:37 - animation for us now we see that there's
28:39 - a bunch of other properties that I could
28:42 - put but I'm just going to leave it as
28:44 - fly this will work fine so now when I
28:46 - play my bird is not doing anything and
28:49 - it's very subtle but now he only plays
28:51 - the fly animation when I
28:53 - click cool all
28:56 - right now we've learned how to animate
28:59 - access animation
29:00 - Sprites we've learned how to change
29:04 - properties now we're going to edit our
29:07 - scene a little bit let's go to our main
29:10 - scene and I want to add something called
29:14 - a parallx background which is up here
29:19 - parallx background we're going to create
29:21 - this and what is this well it's
29:23 - basically a parallx background layer so
29:26 - let's add a another node and we're going
29:28 - to add a parallx layer now let's take a
29:31 - look at how this
29:32 - works if I take my background I'm going
29:37 - to add this
29:38 - one take this background transform it to
29:43 - 1.5 to move it down a little
29:46 - bit and in case you're wondering if you
29:49 - want to turn on or off the GD snap which
29:52 - is useful you can easily do it with
29:55 - shift G or this guy right right here all
29:58 - right so I'm going to move this in the
30:00 - middle and I don't want this to move so
30:02 - I'm going to put it right there Above
30:05 - The Parallax layer now in the layer
30:08 - we're going to add something we're going
30:10 - to add
30:13 - our pipe to see we're just going to add
30:16 - this guy just to test it now you see
30:18 - when I tried adding it it just added it
30:20 - over here in the world we want to move
30:23 - this to be a child of the Parallax layer
30:26 - all right we now have a pretty
30:28 - complicated setup on the left we
30:31 - basically have the parallx layer a child
30:34 - of the world which is fine because we
30:37 - are playing in a 2d world we have the
30:40 - paralic background which is a parent of
30:42 - these two nodes and the parallx layer is
30:45 - what we're going to use to move so let's
30:47 - go to our parallx background and we're
30:49 - going to add a script we're going to
30:50 - have it built
30:52 - in and you don't have to make it built
30:54 - in but that's so it's up to you we're
30:57 - going to edit something in our process
30:59 - function we're going to change the
31:02 - scroll base
31:05 - offsetx and we're going to subtract
31:07 - scroll speed times Delta now what's
31:09 - scroll speed well we have to give we
31:12 - have to give that variable like into
31:15 - existence because it doesn't exist so
31:17 - let's say variable scroll speed is equal
31:20 - to zero now in
31:23 - Gau variables are just called variables
31:26 - now if I want to specify a specific
31:29 - variable to a type here right after I
31:32 - think it's here let's find out together
31:34 - we can say int like this and this will
31:37 - specify that it's an integer now either
31:39 - way it doesn't really matter because gdo
31:41 - is actually smart and will automatically
31:44 - kind of assume what this type is so here
31:46 - when I just say equal to zero it's
31:48 - automatically assuming that it's an
31:50 - integer now this is nice but I'm going
31:53 - to add something called
31:55 - export we're going to to export variable
31:58 - scroll speed now what does this do well
32:01 - if I go back to my 2D scene and I click
32:05 - the parallx background and I look at the
32:07 - properties well now I see it says
32:09 - built-in script and then right below
32:12 - that it says scroll speed and now I can
32:15 - change that to 50 or whatever number
32:17 - you'd like now if I
32:20 - play our background is moving the
32:23 - parallx background is starting to move
32:25 - which is great that's really cool
32:28 - so this is pretty neat one more thing
32:31 - that's usually used in parallx
32:33 - background is called mirroring now if I
32:35 - want the same background to show up I
32:38 - can mirror it by maybe giving it 100
32:42 - usually you want to give it the same
32:43 - number that is this one so
32:47 - 26 zoom out and now if I play it should
32:52 - duplicate so forget the bird we don't
32:54 - need
32:56 - him have that one that's the second one
32:58 - and there we go there's our third one
33:00 - right even though we didn't draw a third
33:02 - one it is now showing up in our game
33:05 - right and it's going to keep mirroring
33:08 - forever so that's very useful but that's
33:11 - not exactly what we need but it was a
33:13 - good thing to see what this is now let's
33:16 - delete this parallx layer and we're
33:18 - going to add something called a tile map
33:22 - now gdau is actually pretty unique in
33:24 - their tile map because it's really it's
33:26 - a really power ful tool than not many
33:28 - other engines have so in our tile map we
33:31 - see tile set on the right side up here
33:35 - it says empty so we're going to click it
33:37 - and give it a new tile
33:39 - set now on the bottom we have tile set
33:42 - and tile map in tile set this is where
33:45 - the editing happens any sort of editing
33:48 - to my tile map is going to happen here
33:52 - any sort of application that I actually
33:55 - put into my game will happen in the tile
33:58 - map hopefully you understood that if not
34:01 - that's okay we're going to learn this
34:02 - with an example so clicking our tile set
34:06 - on the bottom we're going to take
34:09 - the tile style one because this is the
34:13 - ground and we're going to drag this in
34:16 - we're going to click yes and we're going
34:18 - to scroll down a little bit and we're
34:19 - just going to take a look at here
34:23 - now the do 4 I actually just changed
34:26 - this so it's a little
34:27 - I don't know if you want to call it
34:28 - easier or harder but it's really cool so
34:32 - pay close attention we're going to go to
34:34 - the top right we're going to click tile
34:36 - set on here we're going to click this
34:39 - tile set now this these new properties
34:41 - will show up and we see physics layer
34:44 - and a bunch of other things the only one
34:46 - we're going to focus on right now is
34:47 - physics layer we're going to click add
34:50 - element and this has basically allowed
34:52 - us to create a physics layer so now
34:55 - we're going to unel select that and
34:57 - close this we're going to go back to our
34:59 - tile set because remember if we want to
35:01 - edit anything from our tiles we have to
35:04 - do it in the tile
35:05 - set right so now let's go back to paint
35:09 - actually I'm going to give a quick
35:12 - demonstration as to why we need to do
35:14 - this let's go into our tiles into tile
35:19 - map so make sure we're in tile map and
35:21 - we see tiles here we can select a tile
35:25 - and now we can just draw now okay if you
35:27 - have move mode selected it won't allow
35:29 - you to draw you have to have the select
35:33 - mode selected and now we can see the
35:35 - tiles right there so let's draw along
35:38 - the map and let's maybe put this one now
35:43 - we can also paint or use a rectangle
35:45 - like this to make it a little easier or
35:48 - quicker will make this easier for us now
35:51 - if I
35:52 - play what's going to happen well my
35:55 - player just fell right through that's
35:57 - not what we want we want an actual
35:59 - physics layer now in my tile set again
36:02 - we're going to go back to the tile set
36:04 - we're going to go to paint paint
36:07 - properties and we're going to select the
36:09 - physics layer right here we have physics
36:12 - layer now if we did not create that
36:13 - physics layer you will not see this if
36:16 - you did not see this physics layer
36:18 - please go back you missed a step okay so
36:21 - let's click this physics layer and now
36:23 - we have some things here let's drag the
36:26 - up a little bit so we see everything now
36:29 - here it's actually very neat because we
36:31 - can specify the physics um layer for all
36:36 - of these tiles now I'm just going to
36:37 - select all of these because it doesn't
36:39 - actually matter but for future reference
36:41 - you can actually change these points and
36:44 - change the
36:45 - Collision see that very cool so I'm not
36:49 - going to go too much into detail about
36:51 - tile Maps there are I actually have a
36:54 - relatively good video on tile Maps it's
36:56 - about 23 minutes long and you can check
36:58 - it out is I it's in my channel somewhere
37:02 - you can find it um but um there are a
37:06 - lot of tutorials on to Maps so we're
37:08 - going to just do this and let's play
37:10 - Let's see what we have
37:12 - now bam he hit the floor but we can see
37:15 - that there's a little Gap why is that
37:17 - happening I want you to try to take a
37:19 - guess as to why this is happening so
37:21 - pause the video and try to figure out
37:23 - why there's a little Gap there hopefully
37:25 - you've unpaused
37:27 - well if we scroll down into our bird we
37:30 - see that the physics layer of our bird
37:33 - is this big so it it's working how it
37:35 - should so if we select our Collision map
37:39 - shape we can see here if I try to drag
37:41 - this up and down it's not working very
37:43 - well and that's because we have the grid
37:46 - snap turned on so let's turn that off by
37:48 - clicking shift G or just clicking that
37:51 - and let's pin this down to fit our bird
37:55 - properly cool so now when I
37:59 - play it works as it should awesome all
38:05 - right we now want to add a way to detect
38:09 - if we hit the floor or the pipe in the
38:13 - future so right now we have the tile map
38:16 - called tile map we're going to rename
38:18 - this to
38:20 - walls this is going to represent the
38:22 - walls or the the floor in fact actually
38:25 - I'm just going to rename it to floor I
38:26 - don't know why I renamed it to wall but
38:29 - FL is probably more appropriate now in
38:31 - our bird we're going to add a new node
38:34 - called area 2D so if I add a new node
38:39 - add this node called area 2D and now
38:42 - it's part of our bird and then we need
38:44 - to add a collision shape which we can
38:46 - actually find in the recent as well or
38:49 - you can just search it up whichever one
38:51 - you
38:52 - prefer now we see that it needs a shape
38:55 - so let's actually Zoom in here because
38:57 - this is important when we play with area
39:00 - 2DS with Collision shapes with the
39:02 - actual body or rigid body if this area
39:05 - 2D is smaller than this Collision box or
39:08 - the same size I believe it becomes
39:11 - inapplicable and it basically can't
39:13 - detect anything so you have to make sure
39:15 - the area 2D Collision is bigger than the
39:19 - Collision shape of the actual rigid body
39:22 - okay let's zoom out and now in our area
39:26 - 2D we're going to go to the top right we
39:29 - have inspector and then something called
39:31 - node now node is where all our signals
39:34 - will be there's also something called
39:36 - groups but there are a lot of videos
39:38 - about that and you can check that out
39:40 - groups is uh completely separate from
39:43 - not from signals but we don't have to
39:44 - worry about it right now we're going to
39:46 - focus at the signals in general so let's
39:49 - take a look at what sort of signals
39:51 - exist first of all it's important to
39:53 - note that these signals here are all
39:56 - specific to the area 2D these are
39:59 - built-in signals or functions specific
40:02 - for area 2D now there are other signals
40:06 - that are general for other things like
40:09 - node or canvas item or Collision object
40:13 - or object on the bottom and in fact if
40:17 - we go to our bird and select this bird
40:19 - instead we see there's different signals
40:22 - but these are all the same that's
40:24 - because they all inherit the same type
40:27 - of node now let's go back to our area 2D
40:30 - we want to connect a body entered this
40:33 - will basically look for anything with a
40:36 - physical body you can see you can read
40:38 - it and it says tile map in there so
40:41 - we're going to double click this and if
40:43 - it'll actually
40:44 - automatically prompt us to select this
40:47 - the script of the bird now if it prompts
40:50 - you to select something else we make
40:51 - sure that it's prompting us to send the
40:54 - signal to the bird let's connect connect
40:56 - it now we have this signal so what is a
41:00 - signal what what is this thing well when
41:03 - this bird and the area 2D specifically
41:06 - the area 2D hits anything the signal
41:09 - will proc whenever a b body enters
41:12 - whenever a body enters this area this
41:15 - signal will proc and basically get and
41:18 - say hey something happened right and
41:21 - what do we want to do well first let's
41:24 - print the body let's see what it says
41:26 - let's print the body. name because the
41:29 - name is actually a property so here we
41:31 - renamed it to floor it should print
41:34 - floor if we hit the floor so let's play
41:36 - and see what
41:38 - happens ah so it says floor and bird but
41:42 - why does it say bird well that's because
41:44 - the area 2D actually collided with the
41:47 - Collision shape as well so what we're
41:50 - going to do is we're going to add a if
41:53 - statement that says if the body. name is
41:56 - equal to floor then we're going to Q
42:00 - free this is basically going to delete
42:02 - our player our
42:05 - bird oh there he goes he got deleted
42:08 - cool we have a relatively somewhat
42:10 - working game with no pipes and we can
42:13 - stay alive and it works pretty well and
42:16 - if I hit the floor I die all right so
42:19 - let's start adding some pipes because
42:21 - well this isn't fun without any pipes
42:23 - right so let's take a look at how we're
42:26 - going to add this pipe well I want to
42:29 - actually add a new tile
42:32 - map and in this tile map we're going to
42:34 - go to the tile set new tile set click
42:38 - this go to tile set here and we're going
42:41 - to add whichever pipes you want there's
42:43 - this one I'm going to add this one and
42:46 - there's also this one which you can add
42:48 - I suppose I don't know uh actually I'm
42:50 - going to add the bottom one because I
42:53 - think that's the one I used in my
42:54 - reference so I'm going to go back here
42:56 - and delete this by clicking this and now
42:59 - I have the pipe style actually one more
43:02 - time it
43:04 - should now one thing I will say is you
43:07 - will notice the ID changes and this is
43:09 - important for later but at the moment
43:11 - I'm just going to make sure that the ID
43:13 - is
43:14 - zero to stay
43:16 - consistent okay now we see here that the
43:19 - tile set is a little weird it's a bit
43:22 - different now what we want to do instead
43:25 - is we actually want to change
43:28 - the X and Y texture and we can do that
43:32 - by going down here and typing 32 oh no
43:36 - sorry 32 for the X but 16 for the Y and
43:40 - now we can select this entire thing we
43:43 - also want to do the same thing for the
43:46 - tile size up here so we're going to say
43:48 - click
43:49 - 32 now we can select a tile like this
43:53 - now let's go to tile map and add it we
43:56 - can see that we can actually add a
43:58 - tile right so I can do
44:02 - this can delete it by right clicking
44:05 - let's add a long pipe
44:09 - here
44:10 - that and we
44:12 - can do that and now we have a pipe let's
44:16 - also add a physics layer now I want you
44:18 - to try this remember how we added the
44:21 - physics layer and added the Collision so
44:24 - I want you to pause the video and try
44:25 - this and give it a
44:28 - try P an
44:30 - element tile set we're going to go to
44:33 - paint physics layer we're just going to
44:36 - select all of
44:38 - these you can see here that we can even
44:40 - edit it here I'm not going to care too
44:43 - much about the tiny Collision here like
44:46 - you could do this if you'd like if you
44:48 - are very specific about
44:51 - it I guess I just did that but yeah so
44:54 - you can do that and now the is very
44:56 - specific all right so now we have this
45:00 - tile map that doesn't move right because
45:03 - if I play it just stays there now
45:06 - usually you would think that we want the
45:09 - bird to move forward but what we're
45:11 - actually going to do is we're going to
45:13 - rename this to pipes and then we're
45:17 - actually going to attach a script to
45:18 - this we're going to not make it buil in
45:20 - this time let's create it and in our
45:23 - process function we're just going to add
45:25 - something very
45:27 - simple we're going to say
45:29 - positionx minus equal 60 which is
45:32 - basically speed time Delta now let's go
45:35 - back to our 2D script or 2D scene and
45:39 - play now we see that our pipes are
45:43 - moving it looks like our bird is moving
45:45 - towards the pipe but the pipe is moving
45:47 - towards us and I collide with the pipe
45:51 - now what we can do is go back to our
45:53 - bird and add I want you to try this add
45:55 - a check to see if you can destroy the
45:58 - bird when you hit a pipe pause the video
46:02 - give it a try and unpause when you're
46:05 - done or confused all right so all we're
46:08 - going to do is I'm going to duplicate
46:09 - this and type in
46:14 - pipes now when I
46:16 - play and I hit the pipe my bird goes
46:20 - away cool so in our script we actually
46:25 - want to
46:26 - randomize this now how can we randomize
46:29 - this well I have created a relatively
46:34 - complex script that you probably
46:36 - shouldn't do but I've decided that I'm
46:40 - lazy and I don't know I just like doing
46:43 - it this way so let's um take our pipe
46:47 - and we're going to actually Save branch
46:49 - as scene nope wait
46:54 - yes yeah I was right
46:56 - okay we're going to save the branch of
46:57 - scene and now this thing appeared says
46:59 - open an editor but what is that what
47:01 - does that mean well what we can do now
47:04 - is we can actually take this and delete
47:06 - it now don't worry it's not gone we've
47:10 - actually have it over
47:12 - here now in our pipes we can see that we
47:17 - have our pipes but over here it's not
47:19 - here so first of all we want to be able
47:21 - to spawn in these pipes and then we also
47:24 - want to randomize the
47:26 - Gap essentially
47:28 - now let's look at the randomization
47:31 - first because that's a little lengthy
47:34 - you don't have to understand the code
47:35 - too much but basically first of all we
47:38 - have to Let's remove the tile set or the
47:42 - Tom up here let's go to our tiles or
47:46 - pipes now we're going to randomize this
47:49 - in our ready function so first we're
47:52 - going to
47:53 - say set the top pipe and then we're
47:56 - going to create a random variable
47:58 - between 1 and 15 and we do that by
48:00 - saying variable random range top is
48:04 - equal to Randy range 1 to
48:06 - 15 and then we're going to for
48:09 - Loop in range of Randy range top now I'm
48:14 - going to show you another way to for
48:16 - Loop but this is one way and then we're
48:18 - going to do something called set cell
48:21 - this is going to set the cell on our map
48:26 - with a bunch of these numbers now what
48:27 - do these numbers mean well let's take a
48:29 - look so if I say set
48:32 - cell sorry about that we have a bunch of
48:35 - inputs we have layer coordinates Source
48:38 - ID and a bunch of other things now if
48:40 - you want to understand this more in
48:42 - depth again I have a really good video
48:44 - about this on on tile maps that you
48:47 - should definitely check out TI maps are
48:49 - a bit I wouldn't say complicated but a
48:51 - little more advanced and it can get very
48:54 - difficult to wrap your your head around
48:56 - it if this is your first time using it
48:58 - but for the sake of getting this to work
49:01 - we're just going to copy the code over
49:03 - and this will set the bottom two cells
49:06 - and
49:07 - then we're going to set the bottom pipe
49:10 - as well by doing this now in this for
49:13 - Loop we are not saying in range we're
49:15 - just saying in
49:17 - 15 okay we have this
49:20 - code if I
49:23 - play oops I have to play from the pipes
49:26 - I want to check the pipes if this works
49:28 - now how can I do that on the top right
49:30 - there's run current scene this will
49:32 - allow me to run this current scene which
49:34 - is called pipes so if I touch click that
49:37 - we now see this awesome we now have a
49:40 - randomized pipe let's stop and then play
49:42 - again to see if it is
49:43 - randomized it's a little
49:46 - different cool it's very different okay
49:49 - so we see that this works if you would
49:51 - like to try to understand it I would
49:53 - give you kudos for it um however I'm not
49:56 - going to go through the logistics of
49:58 - this again I have a lengthy video about
50:01 - tile maps that explains most of this
50:03 - it's pretty neat and it's uh on
50:05 - isometric tiles as well which is a
50:09 - bonus but it works relatively the same
50:12 - so let's go back to 2D let's go to our
50:15 - pipes we're going to close this for now
50:18 - we're going to go to our parallx
50:20 - background make sure this is selected
50:22 - and we're going to add a new node called
50:26 - timer in this timer what is this timer
50:29 - thing that we just added well it's
50:32 - literally a timer it will just start
50:35 - whenever we want it to in fact there's a
50:37 - property on the right that says auto
50:39 - start I can click on and this will
50:42 - automatically start it when I load this
50:44 - scene now I'm going to explain to you
50:47 - what we want to happen and I want you to
50:48 - give it a try we want to connect a
50:52 - signal from this timer to our parallel
50:55 - background script and then we want to
50:58 - spawn our wall now let's go look at our
51:03 - script and create a function called Funk
51:08 - spawn and I'm going to help you create
51:10 - this
51:11 - function and then I want you to try to
51:14 - spawn them in yourself now in order to
51:17 - spawn something that is from a separate
51:20 - scene I I think it's a little easier
51:22 - than Unity we do something called on
51:25 - ready variable wall or we'll change it
51:28 - to
51:29 - pipe and then we're going to preload it
51:32 - we're going to say preload and then give
51:34 - it the path now what is this path well
51:37 - this is the path of the pipe well I
51:40 - called it wall in my reference but here
51:43 - it's pipe so if I take the pipe that I
51:45 - just created and then I drag it into
51:47 - this preload it will give me the path
51:49 - for it alternatively you can also right
51:51 - click the pipes and there should be copy
51:54 - path control shift C now in our function
51:58 - spawn we're going to do something
52:02 - called variable wall temp and then we're
52:06 - going to create make it equal to the
52:08 - pipe.
52:10 - instantiate and then we're going to say
52:12 - add child because instantiating it
52:15 - doesn't actually add it to our Scene It
52:17 - just creates the object now we're going
52:20 - to add the child into our scene and that
52:23 - is it that is it for the spawn now I can
52:25 - spawn it in the ready function for
52:27 - example let's create let's do this and
52:30 - let's see what we
52:31 - get well there's our first pipe but we
52:34 - want it to keep spawning pipes right so
52:37 - how do we do that well hopefully you
52:39 - figured this out by now but in our node
52:42 - on the top right of our timer we click
52:44 - this and there's a node signal called
52:48 - timeout and you can see here that it's
52:50 - trying to connect it to our bird but we
52:52 - don't want that we want it to connect to
52:54 - our parallx background script so let's
52:56 - connect that to our paralu background
52:58 - script connect it and we're going to
53:01 - call the spawn function when the timer
53:03 - runs
53:04 - out now let's play and see what we
53:08 - get well there we go now we have a bunch
53:11 - of
53:12 - pipes o that's not exactly what I
53:17 - wanted
53:19 - well let's go to our parallx background
53:23 - go to our timer inspect and first of all
53:26 - let's change the weight time now the
53:28 - question is why did the bird not get
53:31 - deleted when I hit it well because let's
53:35 - actually play and I'll show you why we
53:38 - can look to our remote and we go to our
53:41 - world paralex we can see it's we have
53:45 - pipes but then it's adding a bunch of
53:47 - other things that just says tile map so
53:50 - I have 1 2 3 four five whatever well
53:53 - that's not what we want we want to make
53:56 - it equals the pipes so let's go back to
53:59 - our parallx
54:01 - background and we're going to take our
54:03 - wall temp and we can actually take the
54:07 - name which is a property and rename it
54:10 - to something we're going to rename it to
54:13 - pipe now or pipes now this might work
54:18 - let's play and take a look in our remote
54:23 - section doesn't seem to work now why is
54:27 - that the reason why it wasn't working is
54:30 - because in our pipes we were renaming it
54:34 - every time to the same thing but it
54:36 - wouldn't do that because we already had
54:38 - one that existed with the same name so
54:40 - what's an alternative well we're going
54:42 - to use something called in but first of
54:46 - all we're going to create something so
54:48 - in our pipe script we're going to create
54:51 - something called variable wall or uh
54:53 - we'll say yeah we'll say
54:57 - wall now we're going to save this we're
54:59 - going to go to our bird script and in
55:01 - here what we can do is we can say if
55:07 - wall I think it has to be capitalized
55:10 - yeah it has to be the same so let's
55:11 - actually make this lower case and then
55:13 - we'll make this lower case as well we'll
55:15 - say if the wall is in the
55:17 - body then we can Q free now now we can
55:22 - delete this first of all but this is
55:25 - basically checking to see if the
55:27 - property is in that wall that we or the
55:29 - body that we just collided with so let's
55:31 - play and now it should work relatively
55:35 - fine let's test this one more time by
55:37 - going to the second
55:39 - pipe and there we
55:41 - go all
55:43 - right we are almost done we just have a
55:47 - little bit more we're going to create
55:49 - something called a global script now how
55:51 - do we do this well first of all let's
55:53 - create a new script we can we have two
55:55 - options we can either go here right
55:57 - click oh I guess they removed that I
56:00 - think we can go to file and say new
56:01 - script or contrl n or we can go to the
56:04 - res file on the bottom left create new
56:07 - and create new script we're going to
56:09 - create something called game or
56:13 - Global and in this Global we're going to
56:15 - remove all this and say
56:17 - variable
56:19 - point we're going to set it to zero this
56:22 - is the points that our player is going
56:24 - to collect
56:25 - now in our pipes we're going to create
56:28 - an area 2D that is going to ding or give
56:32 - our player a point every time we hit it
56:34 - so let's create this and add a collision
56:37 - shape now how are we going to make this
56:39 - work well it's actually pretty simple we
56:41 - just have to create a long rectangle
56:43 - we're going to move this all the way to
56:45 - the right where the pipe should be and
56:47 - we're going to make it relatively skinny
56:49 - now we're going to go to the area 2D and
56:51 - say if body entered connect this
56:55 - and we'll say if bird inbody body. name
57:01 - because the bird is not a variable but
57:04 - it's the name of our Bird right so now
57:07 - let's go back to our pipe and we're
57:08 - going to say
57:10 - Global do points plus equals 1 however
57:15 - this should error there we go not
57:17 - declared in current scope now how do I
57:20 - make this Global how do I access the
57:21 - script from this script well on the top
57:26 - left we go to our project
57:28 - settings this should open
57:31 - up autoload we go to autoload right here
57:35 - this is where we can autoload or
57:38 - globalize scripts or even scenes so if I
57:41 - click the folder button this guy will
57:44 - pop up and you can see I can actually
57:46 - select the scene too however we're just
57:49 - going to select the global script and
57:51 - open this now it says the path we're
57:54 - going to add it this is the name of the
57:56 - script to access it we're going to close
57:58 - it and this should work should
58:01 - unair sometimes if it doesn't work what
58:03 - we can do is close this and play it
58:05 - again or open it and there we go now in
58:09 - my world we have no way of keeping track
58:12 - of the game points so let's add
58:15 - something let's go to our world and add
58:18 - a
58:20 - label this label is just a label it's
58:23 - basically text so if I go to the
58:24 - inspector and add text I can write a
58:27 - bunch of gibberish but that's not what I
58:29 - want I want to create a script onto this
58:33 - and we're going to say self. text is
58:36 - equal to string because I'll explain it
58:40 - in second global. points because we have
58:44 - to convert this points into a string
58:47 - because this is actually an integer and
58:49 - text is a string we cannot set a string
58:52 - with a integer it has to be a string
58:56 - okay so this should allow us to show how
58:58 - many points we have so let's
59:00 - play and we see on the top left we have
59:03 - the
59:03 - points and every time it pass to the
59:05 - pipe increases the point and if I die it
59:08 - should not increase the point and that's
59:10 - it all right that is pretty much the end
59:13 - of this season series I hope you enjoyed
59:15 - it and I'll see you guys congratulations
59:18 - you have finished this video the mini
59:21 - course if you guys enjoyed this course
59:23 - or little video I made um please
59:26 - subscribe uh share the video with your
59:28 - friends or other Unity developers that
59:31 - have not transitioned yet um what else
59:34 - if you guys liked my content um I'm
59:37 - going to be working on a course coming
59:39 - up soon is going to be a really really
59:42 - big course consisting of not only how to
59:45 - master good D but also game development
59:48 - and getting started in game development
59:50 - um it is not out yet most likely it's
59:53 - going to take me a while to get it out
59:56 - however if you would like to support me
59:57 - on that and my development of that
59:59 - course um I would appreciate it to
60:03 - either support me on patreon or I will
60:05 - have a Kickstarter soon so please
60:07 - subscribe to stay updated on that um
60:10 - also join my Discord which will also be
60:12 - in the link down below again
60:14 - congratulations for finishing this video
60:16 - it was pretty long um hopefully you can
60:19 - continue on with this project and build
60:22 - on it and who knows maybe you can
60:24 - release it probably not because the
60:26 - assets are you know flppy bird but
60:30 - that's okay I hope you enjoyed making
60:33 - your first game in good d
