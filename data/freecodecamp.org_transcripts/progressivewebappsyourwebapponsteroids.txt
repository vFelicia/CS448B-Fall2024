00:03 - so thanks for coming uh my name is
00:05 - maxons and i'm pretty happy to be here
00:07 - in indiana this is the first time for me
00:10 - and for now i i really like the city so
00:13 - it's really cool
00:14 - uh we're gonna talk for
00:16 - i'm gonna talk for for the next hour
00:18 - about
00:19 - the the progressive web apps uh
00:22 - yes
00:25 - all of my slide everything uh this is my
00:27 - slide deck um pu dot f slash torque
00:31 - i'm gonna give some
00:33 - some numbers etc so if you want to check
00:35 - the source uh even if you want to to see
00:37 - back the the slide after go
00:40 - go here
00:41 - after you just need to select uh
00:44 - the correct uh the quest torque which is
00:47 - a progressive way back
00:50 - okay
00:51 - so
00:52 - this is the the starting points of
00:55 - of my torch
00:56 - um months ago
00:59 - i read the i
01:01 - i started to find on the on the
01:04 - on twitter on some blog posts were
01:06 - talking about native apps and according
01:08 - to some people
01:09 - uh they were
01:11 - doomed so
01:14 - i start to to dig into uh into that and
01:18 - i find some interesting
01:20 - studios interesting statistics about it
01:24 - first of all
01:26 - fifty percent of the american user
01:29 - download zero up per month
01:32 - uh
01:33 - then only ten percent download one app
01:36 - amounts and after 110 etc
01:40 - okay i also find that
01:43 - most of the time we spend on our
01:45 - smartphone is on the
01:47 - three
01:48 - on the top three app
01:50 - and also
01:52 - uh less points it's more about revenue
01:55 - uh
01:56 - it's pretty hard if you are doing uh
01:59 - an active application to get revenue
02:01 - from this
02:03 - if you are out of this um
02:05 - this publish also all the google et
02:07 - cetera
02:11 - there is another problem if if your
02:14 - company got an app it's hard to to reach
02:16 - people
02:17 - what i mean is on every step you got for
02:21 - on every step you are losing 20 percent
02:23 - of the user so you have to find an app
02:27 - you lost 20 users then you click on the
02:29 - detail you lost uh 20 user etc etc etc
02:33 - so at the end if if you want to reach
02:36 - 1000 user at the end maybe
02:39 - uh
02:40 - 262 according to this today uh
02:43 - 262 yeah it's it's an average but gonna
02:47 - use the app
02:48 - and on this 262
02:51 - uh
02:52 - the studies say
02:55 - 50 50 75
02:57 - of the user download an app
02:59 - use it once and never come back
03:02 - on the day two we get uh we are more
03:05 - than eighty percent
03:07 - until at three months after or even
03:12 - yeah three months after we got something
03:13 - close to five percent of the user we
03:16 - still use your application
03:19 - the the reason is
03:22 - one of the reason is sometimes we have
03:25 - to to download an app and we don't
03:27 - really want it when i came here in
03:28 - vienna i had to install the an app for
03:31 - um
03:33 - for lutzfenza i think
03:35 - uh i'm just gonna use this app once and
03:38 - look it's
03:40 - yeah it was pretty similar something
03:41 - like 40 megabytes
03:43 - just to show one qr code to the
03:48 - yeah
03:48 - on the airport that's
03:51 - only why i need an app
03:53 - for this after there is some use case
03:55 - it's still relevant
03:59 - about
04:00 - uh about reachability also
04:04 - um
04:05 - because of all of this friction it's
04:07 - hard for you to
04:10 - to get new customers on the
04:13 - on your app
04:14 - and on the other hand
04:17 - a mobile
04:18 - with the web it's
04:20 - pretty more simple to reach new
04:23 - customers
04:29 - but
04:30 - but uh
04:32 - if you got an app you probably you
04:34 - probably know that
04:36 - the user spend more time on the on the
04:38 - native app than a mobile application
04:42 - why
04:44 - the answer is pretty simple
04:48 - you got notification the user got
04:51 - already taken on the
04:53 - on the desktop so
04:56 - yeah there is more engagement
05:01 - so let's summarize we got
05:03 - two things we got the mobile app and the
05:05 - website
05:06 - we with the mobile app we can do a lot
05:09 - of things
05:11 - there is a lot of capability etc but the
05:14 - rich ability is really hard
05:16 - and
05:17 - here my web app
05:20 - i can reach a lot of people but i cannot
05:22 - retain them
05:25 - so
05:26 - some people mostly from from google they
05:30 - they start from from this starting point
05:32 - and say okay how to put uh how to
05:35 - increase
05:36 - the my website
05:38 - and get something with more capabilities
05:42 - so that's
05:46 - that's the main uh
05:48 - yeah the main reason to you to switch to
05:50 - something called the the progressive web
05:52 - apps
05:54 - so we're gonna try to
05:56 - put at the same level uh
05:59 - in term of functionalities
06:01 - an active app on a web app
06:07 - the progressive web apps
06:09 - it's
06:10 - uh
06:11 - it's just a set of
06:13 - of correct rule that your web apps
06:16 - have to
06:17 - have to reach
06:19 - so take care you don't need to update
06:21 - your
06:21 - your linkedin profile right now
06:23 - you probably do some some of them
06:26 - the first one one of the first rule is
06:30 - get links
06:35 - one page you got one link welcome to
06:37 - http protocol something it's pretty
06:39 - basic so i'm not gonna stay longer on
06:41 - this slide
06:43 - um
06:44 - i was talking about http
06:47 - we could add an s you recognize the lock
06:49 - here
06:53 - for years
06:55 - people
06:56 - didn't switch to https because of monet
06:59 - they did not want to buy a certificate
07:02 - i have a good news since
07:04 - 2016 now
07:06 - there is something called let some
07:07 - scripts
07:08 - and now
07:09 - this organization provide a free
07:12 - certificate
07:14 - and
07:15 - no it's not from hipster or bitnix look
07:18 - there is a lot of
07:21 - look dispenser i mean we can trust this
07:28 - okay the third point really basic as
07:32 - well responsive
07:34 - uh if you still don't know what's
07:36 - responsive
07:37 - remember this picture from stephanie
07:39 - walter
07:40 - uh let me and she said
07:47 - yeah content content is like it's like
07:49 - water so don't want to put all the data
07:51 - from this screen to you to your mobile
07:55 - it's do something uh yeah responsive to
07:58 - adapt to
07:59 - to the device
08:02 - now we start to to reach something a bit
08:04 - more interesting because you probably
08:06 - already follow all this
08:07 - this third
08:09 - yeah this three step
08:10 - the first the fourth one is uh getting
08:13 - something more uh app-like
08:17 - so
08:18 - when you are using a progressive web app
08:20 - you should not think about i am on the
08:22 - web i am on the app now it should see it
08:26 - should be the the same experience
08:31 - there is something interesting called
08:33 - the application
08:35 - architecture
08:37 - so given i'm i'm a shop and i want to
08:41 - to show some
08:44 - to show some clothes
08:45 - george.com did that
08:50 - the cash they put
08:52 - this
08:53 - and the
08:55 - the left um
08:56 - sorry the left
08:58 - the left screen so all the architecture
09:00 - etc you keep it uh
09:03 - it's instant instantly loaded and then
09:06 - you do a asynchronous request to the
09:09 - network and you go and you fetch uh the
09:11 - data on when the data are here it's feed
09:14 - the
09:17 - it it fit the screen you got something
09:19 - pretty similar if you are using
09:23 - microsoft teams it's an equivalent to
09:26 - to
09:28 - to slack and there is also this i think
09:30 - in
09:32 - in facebook when you scroll really
09:33 - really fast you just see the
09:35 - architecture
09:38 - here also an interesting study
09:41 - george.com reduced the the page load
09:44 - by 3.8 by using this
09:47 - so it's something very interesting yeah
09:51 - the fifth point
09:53 - the fifth point is uh getting something
09:56 - uh progressive
10:02 - there is a framework i'm using which is
10:03 - called uh
10:04 - with uh i'm using in my company it's
10:06 - called ugs and they say it's a
10:08 - progressive framework it means
10:11 - you can use this
10:13 - uh you can create some small components
10:15 - in this technology in the
10:18 - old-fashioned websites
10:20 - without breaking everything etc
10:23 - so here it's kind of the same
10:26 - there is a lot of diversity of browsers
10:29 - so if you want to add something fancy
10:33 - in your browser it should not impact the
10:35 - the whole browsers
10:39 - because yes unfortunately not every
10:42 - browser are the same this is a screen
10:45 - from
10:46 - firefox firefox
10:48 - 58
10:49 - so as you can see
10:52 - i cannot
10:54 - i cannot do some bluetooth usb nfc etc
10:58 - but
10:59 - if i check it with my chrome here
11:04 - i think i'm gonna get something slightly
11:07 - different
11:18 - yeah
11:20 - i don't see it
11:21 - yeah for instance uh this and the
11:24 - background background sync etc it's not
11:26 - the same in firefox than in
11:30 - in chrome
11:43 - the six points it's getting
11:46 - a fresh
11:47 - application fresh by fresh i mean always
11:50 - up to date
11:53 - there is something here a new world
11:55 - service workers i will come back in this
11:57 - notion
11:58 - just after
12:01 - the idea behind this is uh
12:04 - to get an application always up to date
12:07 - here if you see this is my uh an app
12:10 - from my bank i updated
12:13 - four days ago and they already asked me
12:15 - to um
12:17 - to do an update
12:19 - well sometime it's it's not a big deal
12:22 - but when i need this app
12:26 - i sometimes i just need it right now
12:28 - like
12:30 - this is what i get
12:32 - the other day
12:33 - i came back from from work and i just
12:36 - wanted to
12:37 - to play to my race game and i got this
12:40 - screen say
12:41 - not today
12:43 - well here it's okay it's 48 megabits but
12:46 - sometime it's even more and it's pretty
12:48 - annoying
12:49 - so the idea behind this is to use
12:52 - something called the
12:56 - background sync
12:59 - to use some tasks in background to
13:02 - update your app
13:03 - um
13:07 - if you are using some browsers like uh
13:10 - firefox chrome it's they're working like
13:12 - this
13:14 - you get an update and they just say oh
13:17 - next time you're gonna you're gonna
13:19 - reload the browser we're gonna get uh
13:20 - you're gonna get a new uh
13:23 - you're gonna get a new
13:24 - a new version but
13:26 - that
13:27 - don't block you
13:29 - so this is the id
13:35 - the seventh point is um about
13:38 - installation
13:39 - as i said before um
13:43 - something good with your uh with native
13:45 - apps is you get the icon on the screen
13:48 - so here the id is exactly the same
13:52 - you should be able to get
13:54 - your web
13:56 - your web icon on screen
13:59 - oops
14:01 - this is the progressive web apps i did
14:04 - with this ugs framework and it's based
14:07 - on the
14:08 - github api so i call it github
14:11 - if you see here
14:14 - there is a small house with a plus
14:16 - so it means
14:18 - it's a progressive web apps you can
14:19 - install
14:21 - you can install this app
14:24 - so if i click here i will get something
14:27 - like this do you want to add
14:29 - this application on your screen
14:31 - i click on add tool screen
14:34 - and here i got it like this so this is
14:36 - my phone
14:38 - you got two icons here in the middle one
14:41 - from
14:42 - firefox and the other one from chrome
14:47 - and
14:48 - the difference between uh
14:51 - this and the shortcut because you know
14:53 - sometimes you can just take a shortcut
14:54 - on the website and put it on your
14:57 - on your on your home
15:00 - on your home page but here it's
15:03 - considered by your um
15:07 - by your uh sorry
15:09 - your um your operating system as an
15:11 - application which means i can after find
15:13 - it if
15:14 - i want to find an application in my
15:16 - phone
15:22 - there is also
15:24 - something so this slide are
15:27 - progressive web apps friendly which
15:29 - means i can also install them
15:32 - so i'm on chrome here
15:34 - and if i want to
15:37 - to install my application wait
15:49 - here i just need i clicked add to home
15:51 - screen
15:55 - and it doesn't work
16:02 - oh no my bad i didn't so look uh there
16:05 - is a at this application to your shelf
16:09 - so you click add
16:12 - and cool my browser is
16:15 - gone
16:18 - well demo effects
16:21 - okay
16:24 - let's restart this
16:29 - okay
16:30 - instead
16:32 - i inspect
16:35 - i go under
16:38 - application
16:40 - at home screen
16:42 - add okay add to uh add to your desktop
16:45 - so here this is how it's working ubuntu
16:49 - and after i got something pretty weird
16:51 - here uh so i click
16:54 - i say trust on launch
16:56 - and
16:57 - tada i got my slide and it's look like
17:00 - uh it's look like an app
17:03 - and look i can also here put it on my uh
17:06 - on my dock you got something pretty
17:08 - similar on
17:09 - osx i didn't test on uh
17:11 - on microsite on microsoft
17:21 - the full screen
17:25 - i didn't test it on microsoft so so yeah
17:27 - every uh
17:29 - every browser got a different way of
17:31 - handling this uh this small house the
17:33 - the install button um
17:35 - i think in
17:37 - in opera it's on the left it's also look
17:39 - like uh it's there is also a plus
17:43 - in chrome you must visit the page uh two
17:46 - time to to get this
17:50 - and
17:51 - yeah that's it the
17:53 - oh
17:54 - you you might think okay it's good oh
17:57 - can i get the this plus button on my on
17:59 - my website
18:00 - there is something called um
18:02 - the manifest.json
18:04 - uh it's it's a web app manifest and
18:07 - it's allow your application to be
18:09 - discoverable
18:13 - so the web app the json it's it's a file
18:16 - where you can put
18:18 - some different uh
18:20 - some different information about your uh
18:24 - about your your web app so you get the
18:26 - name a short name the short name is for
18:29 - the it's to put it on the on the screen
18:31 - on the on your home screen
18:33 - then you got a set of icons
18:37 - as far as remember for chrome you need
18:40 - an icon with 500 pixels something like
18:44 - this
18:45 - start url it's the entry point
18:48 - um
18:51 - check out i put a source equal on screen
18:55 - if you if you check the the spec of the
18:58 - of the web app manifest they say you can
19:01 - you can do this for
19:05 - analytics so after if you got some
19:08 - google analytics or something like this
19:09 - you can say okay i got 10 percent of
19:11 - users using this
19:13 - this web apps from the screen
19:18 - also display fullscreen
19:20 - if you check on my web app on my when i
19:23 - when i checked just before the
19:24 - installation you didn't sew the
19:28 - you didn't sew all the the panel from
19:30 - from the browser and
19:32 - mostly the most important here is we
19:35 - don't see the url bar
19:37 - so it's really look like an
19:39 - a real app from
19:41 - from your phone and after you can put
19:42 - some background color on time color
19:45 - i got another example here so i'm still
19:48 - on chrome
19:51 - if you want to to check
19:55 - your web app manifest on chrome you got
19:57 - the the developers tools and you just
20:00 - yeah go on manifest
20:03 - you will see the the name the shot name
20:05 - etc
20:07 - and the add to home screen so
20:09 - if something is wrong google will
20:11 - the tool will tell you and say oh
20:14 - i cannot add it on the screen because of
20:16 - this this so here
20:19 - i put this
20:21 - some colors and i got all of my sets of
20:24 - icons
20:25 - something cool
20:27 - there is a lot of website you just put
20:29 - one icon and degenerates everything
20:31 - including the the manifest.json so it's
20:34 - pretty easy to do
20:39 - also i was talking about uh microsoft i
20:42 - said i don't i don't know oh how did
20:44 - they manage this but i got the good news
20:50 - microsoft want to crawl all the
20:52 - progressive web app from the from the
20:54 - web
20:56 - convert them into something real i don't
20:59 - know what is app x but after what what
21:01 - they want to do is to
21:04 - to put them in the windows store so
21:07 - as a real application
21:10 - i think it's something really cool but
21:12 - look i put the scientist here so it's
21:15 - it's still in draft
21:16 - so we have to wait they say 2018 so i
21:19 - think but it was in
21:22 - september so i think we have to wait
21:24 - something like six months and after
21:26 - maybe we're gonna see some
21:27 - application in the microsoft store
21:30 - so here for
21:32 - to reach new customer it can be pretty
21:35 - good
21:40 - another point to increase the
21:42 - engagements
21:43 - with your customers
21:45 - is then
21:47 - the notification
21:51 - you probably saw it already in some
21:52 - website
21:53 - well sometime it's a bit annoying
21:55 - because when you open a website say okay
21:59 - can i send you a notification so you
22:01 - accept all your decline
22:03 - and it looks like this
22:05 - so i have to turn off
22:07 - on here
22:09 - when i click
22:10 - i got some notification from uh
22:13 - from the um
22:15 - yeah the operating system and here
22:18 - say okay so you got uh you get a
22:20 - notification from the application called
22:22 - pwa
22:23 - this is the website and this is a
22:26 - message
22:42 - and now
22:43 - the
22:46 - about
22:48 - connection um
22:50 - because the 10 point the
22:53 - this point is about
22:55 - making a websites offline because the
22:59 - the best request is no request
23:03 - it was my face when i saw this i say
23:05 - well
23:06 - i have to do a website
23:08 - offline
23:10 - uh
23:11 - yeah let's explain how it's work oh no
23:13 - before why
23:15 - why well we are in good country with
23:17 - really nice internet connection but
23:19 - unfortunately it's not the same
23:21 - everywhere
23:24 - so yeah in australia it's pretty good uh
23:27 - i'm working in ireland it's pretty good
23:28 - too but if you check in
23:31 - uh some country in asia in africa in
23:33 - south america it's not good
23:37 - well even in france
23:39 - it's one of the best but i'm sure when
23:41 - my parents gonna see this talk on
23:42 - youtube they will not see it in hd
23:44 - because they got a pretty pretty bad
23:46 - connection
23:47 - and also something that we have to keep
23:49 - in mind
23:50 - it's
23:52 - 45 percent of the world population
23:55 - it's still on 2g network
24:00 - so we have to think about these people
24:01 - there is still people in africa they
24:04 - download
24:07 - what the name
24:08 - an android app and after they can give
24:10 - them to each other in uh
24:12 - by usb
24:14 - so yeah unfortunately not everybody got
24:16 - a really fast
24:18 - wi-fi
24:21 - so how does it work
24:23 - uh
24:23 - there is something called a service
24:25 - worker this is a web page on the network
24:29 - something really basic if you want to to
24:31 - see the
24:32 - the page you do an http get to
24:36 - to the network
24:39 - and
24:41 - something is coming in the in the
24:43 - browser well it's already here but
24:47 - the the document from the w3c is still
24:50 - in draft but it's already implemented in
24:53 - all the browsers
24:54 - basically you got
24:56 - your web page
24:58 - if you want to to access to the network
25:00 - there is something in the middle called
25:02 - service worker
25:03 - um it's not only a proxy some people
25:06 - resume a service worker as a proxy but
25:08 - it's
25:10 - it can do much more
25:11 - but
25:12 - the interesting part for
25:15 - from this point is what we can do with
25:17 - the service worker so i want to access
25:19 - to the network and the service worker
25:22 - say oh i saw this request
25:24 - maybe i can put it in the cache so then
25:26 - if you want to get it again
25:29 - you just need to call the cache
25:32 - and all of this is browser side
25:37 - when i saw this i say wow it's pretty
25:39 - cool because now i can do a lot of
25:41 - things in my in my application
25:44 - jake archibald wrote something called
25:46 - the offline cookbook and in this offline
25:49 - cookbook he gave us some
25:52 - some pattern from offline strategy
25:55 - this one is catch first
25:58 - you want to load a page
26:00 - so first you add to the to the cache if
26:03 - there is no nothing in the cache then
26:04 - you fall back on the network
26:10 - is another one it's
26:11 - the opposite
26:12 - it's network network first otherwise
26:15 - you're going the cache
26:22 - yeah for instance if i'm a shop and i
26:24 - want to show the product i can use this
26:27 - but maybe for a really sensitive data
26:29 - like the price or the availability maybe
26:32 - i want to to do something like network
26:35 - only so
26:36 - no way you don't put anything in the
26:38 - cache
26:42 - some more interesting
26:44 - the cache then network
26:46 - so look i asked
26:49 - in parallel to the cache
26:51 - and to the network
26:53 - the cache returned me the data
26:55 - and the on the same time
26:57 - i'm going on the
26:59 - on the network and after i can retrieve
27:00 - the data so while i'm navigating on the
27:02 - website the data so first at t0
27:06 - i got the the data from the cache
27:09 - and after why i'm navigating the data
27:11 - are getting up to date
27:14 - something pretty similar it's my
27:15 - favorite it's
27:17 - style while revalidates um you always
27:20 - saw the
27:22 - the assets but from a
27:24 - t minus one uh from
27:27 - the last time you
27:29 - you were on the on the website it can be
27:30 - interesting for assets like javascript
27:32 - files css etc
27:36 - so first page the user so the so when
27:39 - the user go in your website it saw the
27:41 - the result from yesterday
27:43 - or for uh the last time you went to your
27:46 - website and etc
27:49 - but
27:50 - if you got a single page application
27:52 - maybe it doesn't make sense but if you
27:54 - don't have a single page application a
27:55 - website like facebook usually you don't
27:57 - do only one click you just
27:59 - you reload the page several times so on
28:01 - the first page you get the version from
28:03 - yesterday maybe but the page load
28:05 - instantly and on the second page
28:08 - you got the
28:10 - some up-to-date data
28:13 - so i gave you
28:14 - some few strategies for offline there is
28:18 - much more in the in this website uh in
28:20 - this cookbook i recommend you to take a
28:22 - look
28:22 - and yeah you can also follow this guy
28:24 - jake archibald is a pretty good guy from
28:28 - from google
28:30 - now how does it work how does it work
28:33 - all of this or i can do that on my
28:35 - website
28:37 - this is some javascript
28:39 - code
28:40 - basically everything is based on promise
28:42 - but
28:43 - i don't know about you but
28:45 - sometimes it can be a bit annoying to
28:47 - to write
28:48 - very huge text
28:50 - use um
28:52 - huge cut
28:53 - code just to to manage my assets there
28:56 - is something called workbox workbox it's
28:59 - a pretty good tool uh
29:01 - sponsored by google by the way
29:03 - and
29:04 - basically it looks like this so on the
29:06 - first parameter of this function so so i
29:09 - define some routes and i say okay
29:11 - everything which look like a png gif
29:16 - etc on the image
29:18 - i want to apply a cache first strategy
29:22 - i can also put some fancy name like
29:25 - the the name of of the cache gonna be
29:27 - image uh you only store 60 or 60 image
29:32 - and for a duration of 30 days
29:36 - or if you want something way more simple
29:38 - you can do something like this
29:40 - here i want to store all the http calls
29:45 - from
29:46 - the
29:47 - github api
29:48 - and then i want to apply the
29:51 - network first
29:52 - strategy i'm sorry for you there is no
29:55 - uh
29:56 - you have to deal with regex so if you
29:58 - are not
29:59 - if like me you are not a big fan of
30:01 - regex it can be a small issue
30:11 - now let's switch to the 11 points single
30:14 - page application
30:16 - no i'm joking
30:17 - and hopefully there is a lot of people
30:19 - that say you have to be
30:21 - you have to build a single page
30:23 - application to do a progressive web apps
30:25 - it's wrong
30:26 - and it's something pretty cool because
30:28 - building and second page application is
30:30 - hard
30:32 - so
30:33 - no single page application
30:36 - so
30:37 - let's summarize
30:39 - this is my definition of
30:41 - a progressive web app it's just
30:43 - something really cool like this
30:46 - so you got a website on the privacy web
30:48 - app but it's not really professional so
30:51 - let's switch to
30:52 - to another definition from alex russell
30:57 - another guy from google which is working
30:58 - on progressive web apps
31:01 - it's a
31:02 - it said uh a pwa it's nothing else than
31:06 - a website which take the good vitamin
31:08 - what are this good vitamin
31:10 - so let's summarize it's something
31:12 - reliable so https you can get it
31:16 - even if you are offline
31:19 - also
31:20 - it's fast
31:21 - thanks to the service workers
31:24 - and
31:25 - you can
31:26 - get some engage you can better engage
31:28 - the
31:30 - your your customers with uh by
31:33 - installing the application getting some
31:35 - um
31:38 - what's the name
31:40 - notification etc
31:44 - another great tool to help you to build
31:46 - uh
31:47 - the best pwa it's lighthouse
31:51 - lighthouse you get it by default on
31:53 - chrome
31:54 - so
31:55 - i opened
31:58 - the dev tools here and you get
32:01 - a pan called audit
32:03 - and here you can click
32:05 - to perform an edit
32:07 - you select what you want so here let's
32:09 - select everything and
32:13 - um lighthouse will scroll your website
32:16 - check uh about performance how
32:18 - performance it is and 2g network
32:23 - so blah blah blah and after it will it
32:25 - will give you a report so here i'm
32:28 - probably gonna blame me for the
32:32 - for the performance because uh
32:36 - i got a lot of image and i did not fully
32:38 - optimize them
32:39 - and maybe also gonna complain for
32:42 - some stuff because i put some css in the
32:44 - html it's not really nice but
32:47 - it's not the
32:49 - the goal
32:54 - do i need to wait no i don't have time
32:56 - to
32:58 - wait
33:01 - so yeah you can see
33:03 - what it is doing and here i got my
33:05 - results here so i'm 64 compliant with
33:09 - progressive web app
33:10 - so
33:12 - there is problem because my application
33:13 - doesn't register a service worker
33:16 - i don't i probably break something
33:19 - here you can also get some the first
33:22 - meaningful paint this is really
33:24 - interesting even if you don't want to
33:25 - build a pwa
33:27 - you can get some good insight
33:30 - from your websites say okay i have to
33:33 - optimize this this to get a better seo
33:36 - something good with lighthouse you can
33:38 - also put it in cli
33:41 - so by using it cli it's mean you can use
33:44 - it in your
33:46 - in your pipeline ci cd etc
33:51 - another point really important it's
33:53 - speed matter
33:56 - i like this picture this is the team
33:59 - from red bull they are changing four
34:00 - tires
34:02 - in two seconds
34:04 - while the average page load on the 3g
34:07 - network is 19 seconds
34:11 - well 19 seconds
34:13 - it's
34:14 - really slow i don't know why well no we
34:17 - know basically it's because of the
34:19 - analytics
34:20 - non-optimization etc
34:25 - and something you have to keep in mind
34:27 - about
34:28 - speed if
34:31 - half of the pers of the half of the
34:33 - people expect your website to load in
34:35 - less than two seconds and if your
34:37 - website
34:38 - load in more than three seconds
34:41 - yeah three seconds
34:43 - you lost fifty percent
34:46 - uh
34:47 - 50 percent will bounce
34:50 - so
34:51 - it can be something really nice if you
34:52 - want to to sell pwa in your in your
34:54 - company
34:56 - check the bounce rate
35:00 - but
35:00 - unfortunately today um
35:04 - there is things that we still cannot do
35:07 - in your in a progressive web app like i
35:09 - cannot access to nfc to the calendar to
35:12 - my contact list
35:14 - so we have to wait
35:16 - if you remember the the screen from uh
35:18 - the the screen i show you uh about what
35:20 - the web can do
35:22 - uh it's changing it's moving it's moving
35:24 - really fast
35:25 - so
35:27 - uh i discovered yesterday something
35:29 - called the no not yesterday but
35:32 - a few weeks ago something called um web
35:35 - payments api there is a lot of friction
35:37 - today in uh
35:39 - in your application if you want to sell
35:41 - something
35:43 - basically
35:44 - on my phone there is something pretty
35:45 - good is when i want to buy
35:47 - it's already linked to my google
35:49 - accounts it's pretty fast to buy
35:50 - something on uh on a mobile on a mobile
35:54 - app but on the web you have to take your
35:56 - wallet the credit card etc
35:58 - so yeah to avoid this friction they are
36:01 - developing this payment request api
36:05 - and i think i did this in
36:07 - some
36:08 - really few line of javascripts you can
36:11 - get something like this
36:13 - so
36:13 - here i give you a link if you want to
36:15 - buy an iphone for 10 euro
36:18 - it's look like this
36:19 - and
36:20 - i got something from the browser here
36:23 - and
36:24 - i got the detail of of my bills
36:28 - here i can put the
36:31 - my credit card and i just need to click
36:33 - on pay and that's it
36:35 - i don't need it so i will not pay it
36:41 - also
36:42 - unfortunately the user yet
36:45 - are not really used to this
36:48 - to this install button
36:50 - so
36:51 - i don't know maybe in few years people
36:54 - will use this but for now there is still
36:56 - a reflex to go on the on the store so
37:01 - they have to work on it
37:03 - if you check the the first version of
37:05 - the install button and what is it today
37:07 - it changed a lot so they are
37:10 - they're still trying to find the best
37:11 - way to engage user uh through this this
37:14 - button
37:18 - now
37:20 - the last part is about feedbacks
37:24 - some companies move to to prohibit web
37:27 - apps and they give feedback to the
37:28 - community
37:30 - the first one is
37:32 - twitter
37:34 - if you remember the map i saw you i show
37:37 - you in africa for instance there is no
37:39 - uh the network is pretty low um company
37:42 - like twitter
37:44 - want to keep this market and want to
37:46 - better reach these markets so they
37:48 - create something called twitter lit uh
37:51 - it's
37:53 - it's just twitter but uh
37:56 - you
37:57 - in http request you just take what you
38:00 - need to so the there is less less less
38:03 - more uh request
38:05 - i think the the full home page only took
38:07 - one way one megabits one megabyte to
38:09 - load
38:10 - uh it's much more for the other app
38:14 - um
38:16 - and yeah
38:17 - when they did this app after this
38:20 - they take some metrics and it's pretty
38:22 - interesting to see that
38:25 - because the app is better there is
38:27 - better performance on the
38:30 - with the browser etc so the user use
38:33 - more the applications 65 percent it's a
38:35 - lot so and also people people
38:38 - use more apps they tweet more and
38:41 - they come back more often the 20
38:45 - also uh ford did
38:47 - something pretty similar they switched
38:48 - to pwa
38:51 - plus 100 engagements
38:54 - it's pretty good
38:56 - it's
38:57 - well it's awesome
38:59 - the user use more the application and
39:02 - yeah you got the
39:04 - the source it's also on
39:06 - developer.google.com
39:08 - it's a really good resource to switch to
39:10 - to pwa or to get some insight from
39:12 - company that switched to pwa
39:16 - so it's yeah the developer blog from
39:18 - google
39:20 - and also the the last one is uh what
39:23 - pinterest did pinterest
39:26 - for me it's the the most
39:29 - most important study from from them um
39:32 - so they say okay let's go to pwa and
39:35 - they realize that
39:37 - people stay more on the app they consume
39:39 - more they get more money because they
39:42 - are based on
39:44 - they use advertising fortunately
39:46 - unfortunately for us
39:48 - there is more engagements and after they
39:51 - also did something interesting and they
39:52 - compiled the
39:54 - the statistic from the native app
39:57 - and from the
39:58 - the web app
39:59 - and they realized that it's
40:01 - kind of the same so if you remember
40:05 - at the beginning
40:06 - i was showing you this diagram so
40:09 - today
40:10 - we're here it's in the same level it's
40:12 - not in the same level to be fairly
40:14 - honest but
40:16 - it's changing a lot there is a lot of
40:18 - improvement
40:20 - from the browser it's changing fast so
40:22 - maybe yesterday you didn't wanted
40:24 - a native app for some reason but now you
40:26 - can do it because
40:29 - your web apps can access to your
40:31 - positions your localization you can also
40:34 - buy
40:35 - on your mobile etc so keep an eye on
40:38 - keep an eye on this website what web can
40:40 - do today etc because yeah it's moving
40:44 - it's moving really fast
40:46 - thank you
40:48 - [Applause]
40:53 - i think i got time for some questions
41:04 - no uh so your question is is it possible
41:07 - today
41:09 - to be in the
41:11 - in the application store application
41:12 - store you mean uh the android store and
41:14 - the ios one uh for now the answer is no
41:18 - um
41:20 - there is nothing already checked
41:24 - the only thing is plan is from the
41:25 - microsoft store to put pwa
41:28 - [Music]
41:30 - after i think there is a reason
41:32 - there is a reason why they didn't talk
41:35 - about it it's also because um
41:39 - um
41:41 - because you have to follow some rules
41:43 - mostly for the i think the ios
41:46 - for ios they scan or they scroll your
41:49 - your application et cetera and follow
41:52 - for a web app it's a bit harder to
41:54 - to check what's inside and
41:57 - so for me it's
41:59 - it's the reason after maybe it's gonna
42:02 - change i don't know
42:05 - any other questions
42:19 - so if it's the end the question if it's
42:22 - if it's the end of the native app
42:27 - well
42:27 - i don't have my crystal ball
42:34 - some people say native apps are dooms it
42:36 - was the the introduction
42:40 - i truly believe that today the
42:43 - progressive web app on in few few years
42:46 - they're gonna get challenged
42:49 - um
42:50 - does it still relevant today to build uh
42:52 - to build native apps yes for some
42:54 - companies it's
42:56 - they're making all of the the money here
42:59 - uh after i also saw some even some
43:02 - applications they were only on the
43:04 - on native apps and they switched also to
43:06 - web apps like um tinder they switched to
43:09 - pwa there is a nice blog
43:11 - still on google and they're giving some
43:13 - insight
43:16 - so people
43:18 - so people are switching to to this
43:21 - because there is a need
43:26 - i don't know if if it's gonna get
43:29 - replaced
43:32 - from my point of view yes but
43:34 - i'm pretty i'm not really good for
43:35 - prediction so
43:42 - uh
43:46 - yeah i also put if you check on the on
43:48 - the slide i put some uh some tools also
43:51 - there is one called pwa builder
43:55 - they help you to generate your money
43:56 - first there is a web
43:58 - webpagetest.org to measure the
44:00 - performance of your website
44:03 - yeah also oh yeah you were asking if
44:05 - it's still relevant
44:07 - the native apps it was on my backup
44:08 - slide
44:10 - this is the trend from uh from facebook
44:13 - so
44:14 - the world go on mobile so
44:17 - yes it's relevant to still building uh
44:20 - native apps but pwa for me it's also
44:23 - really interesting because the
44:25 - the mobile on the web
44:28 - it's still the same it doesn't decrease
44:33 - so yeah
44:42 - uh
44:44 - because basically native app has access
44:57 - ah okay
44:59 - yeah
45:00 - uh well i think you can so it's well
45:05 - here
45:06 - so your question is uh
45:09 - what's the website about your privacy
45:12 - right so if there's access to
45:15 - uh i think it's there
45:17 - yeah you got it in chrome settings so
45:20 - you can see here
45:22 - for instance uh your web app can access
45:25 - to your geo localization without asking
45:27 - you
45:30 - i was a bit scared when i saw this i say
45:32 - wow uh
45:33 - they can check a lot of things
45:36 - yeah so your gps localization they don't
45:39 - need to to ask you they can access it
45:41 - directly
45:43 - so here the notification by default ilo
45:46 - but you can also block them but
45:48 - the most important things to watch is
45:50 - what you can get by default
45:53 - so yeah here the camera well not here
45:56 - the location it's the default so they
