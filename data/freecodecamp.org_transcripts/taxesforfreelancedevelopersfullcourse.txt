00:00 - luke siciliano has been a freelance
00:02 - developer for many years
00:04 - in this course he will teach you how to
00:06 - manage your taxes as a freelance
00:08 - developer this course will be especially
00:11 - applicable to people living in the
00:13 - united states
00:22 - hi my name is luke cisliano i'm a
00:24 - self-employed web developer i've done a
00:27 - few articles and videos for free code
00:28 - camp on various issues related to how
00:31 - self-employed developers and freelancers
00:33 - can better manage their business can
00:36 - make more money can get customers things
00:38 - of that nature i've decided to expand on
00:40 - those discussions with this video and a
00:42 - written article that's going along with
00:44 - it that written article will be linked
00:45 - to down below
00:47 - and the discussion in this video is
00:49 - going to be one of the topics that might
00:50 - cause self-employed people more
00:52 - frustration than anything else and that
00:54 - is the management of your taxes
00:56 - obviously if you've worked for yourself
00:57 - you know taxes can be frustrating to
01:00 - deal with it can be confusing so the
01:02 - goal of this video is really going to be
01:05 - to clear up quite a few things and
01:06 - hopefully help people keep a little bit
01:08 - more of what they make now before i get
01:11 - into what all is going to be covered in
01:13 - this video the one thing i really want
01:14 - to stress is that i am not holding
01:16 - myself out as a licensed tax
01:18 - professional i am not a licensed tax
01:20 - professional um no one at free code camp
01:23 - is holding themselves out as tax
01:24 - professionals this video should not be
01:26 - taken as professional tax advice this
01:29 - everything i might be saying is just
01:30 - matters of personal opinion and it only
01:32 - relates to how i do things in my
01:34 - business
01:35 - in terms of your own personal situation
01:37 - you really do need to discuss it with a
01:39 - cpa or a tax attorney or someone of that
01:42 - nature you know with that being said i
01:44 - have been working for myself for quite a
01:46 - few years and um fortunately i've been
01:49 - able to get good tax advice along the
01:51 - way so what i'm going to be just doing
01:53 - in this video is sharing a little bit of
01:55 - just personal knowledge personal
01:56 - opinions and things of that nature so
02:00 - again if you've worked for yourself
02:02 - you understand how frustrating it can be
02:04 - dealing with taxes not just filing your
02:06 - returns but things you've got to file
02:08 - file every quarter if not every month
02:10 - managing withholding
02:12 - things of that nature
02:14 - so what we're going to be getting into
02:15 - in this video is a number of topics
02:18 - number one we're going to talk about why
02:21 - taxes matter in other words why you
02:23 - really need to be mindful of what you're
02:26 - paying to various governmental entities
02:28 - and income tax
02:30 - this taxes tend to be something where a
02:31 - lot of people just think well they're my
02:34 - taxes there's nothing i can do about it
02:35 - i pay what i pay whereas the truth of
02:38 - the matter is
02:39 - you can really get ahead financially by
02:42 - being more mindful of your taxes than
02:44 - most people are okay so the first thing
02:46 - we're going to look at is why taxes
02:47 - matter in the first place the second
02:50 - thing we're going to look at is some
02:52 - important concepts to get our get our
02:54 - arms around before we even really dive
02:57 - into how to maximize deductions and
02:59 - things of that nature because
03:01 - understanding how taxes in the u.s work
03:04 - on a basic level is important to
03:06 - understanding how you're going to get
03:07 - the most out of your various deductions
03:09 - and how you're going to get the most out
03:10 - of your opportunities to save some money
03:12 - on what you send to the government
03:14 - the third thing we're going to look at
03:16 - is the fact that how you structure your
03:20 - business is going to impact how much
03:22 - you're paying in taxes at both the
03:24 - federal level the state level the local
03:26 - level et cetera et cetera so how you
03:28 - structure your business is actually
03:29 - going to have a very big impact on your
03:32 - tax bill at the end of the year
03:34 - the fourth thing we're going to look at
03:35 - is maximizing your deductions in other
03:38 - words making sure that you aren't
03:40 - missing deductions and as a result over
03:42 - reporting your income and as a result of
03:44 - that paying more in taxes than you need
03:47 - to at the end of the year you'd be
03:48 - surprised at how many people miss really
03:50 - important deductions um the fifth thing
03:53 - we're going to look at is how you can go
03:55 - about making your payments to the
03:56 - government during the year because when
03:58 - you're an employee and you get a w-2 and
04:00 - you get a paycheck every you know every
04:02 - week or every two weeks you're used to
04:04 - your employer holding out your taxes and
04:05 - managing all that for you well now that
04:07 - you're self-employed you got to do that
04:08 - yourself so
04:10 - it's really important to know how you go
04:11 - about making your payments during the
04:13 - year
04:14 - and the sixth and last thing we're going
04:16 - to look at is something that a lot of
04:18 - people don't stop to think of and that
04:20 - is the fact that where you live
04:22 - in the united states really impacts how
04:24 - much you're paying in taxes so let's
04:27 - take a look at each of these and just
04:30 - remember that this course is really
04:32 - meant to
04:34 - only i shouldn't even say really meant
04:36 - is
04:36 - meant to only deal with taxation in the
04:38 - united states i have no personal
04:40 - experience paying taxes in other
04:42 - countries i have no personal knowledge
04:44 - of or opinions about tax structures in
04:46 - other countries so this deals with the
04:48 - us only okay so with all that said let's
04:52 - get to it and talk about why you should
04:54 - be mindful of your taxes in the first
04:56 - place
05:05 - okay so the first point i want to get
05:06 - into is the importance of being mindful
05:08 - of your taxes in the first place
05:11 - unfortunately quite a few people and
05:13 - most people for that matter see their
05:15 - taxes as something they just have to pay
05:17 - they think there's nothing they can do
05:18 - about it they think there's nothing they
05:19 - can do to control how much they're
05:21 - paying in taxes
05:23 - and most of those same people also
05:25 - aren't aware of just what their taxes
05:28 - mean to their financial standing okay
05:30 - for most people and i do mean the
05:32 - overwhelming majority in the united
05:34 - states
05:35 - if their taxes aren't their largest bill
05:37 - during the year they're probably the
05:39 - second largest bill and for most people
05:40 - they are the largest bill it's just
05:43 - unfortunately people don't think of it
05:45 - in those terms
05:46 - whenever i have this discussion with
05:47 - people one way i always challenge
05:49 - individuals to look at it is to say hey
05:51 - what are your two biggest expenses and
05:53 - people will usually list their housing
05:54 - number one and then for number two you
05:56 - know they might list a variety of bills
05:58 - maybe health care premiums maybe a car
06:01 - payment whatever
06:03 - but then if you say really do you really
06:04 - think those are your two base expenses
06:06 - and they stop to think about it for a
06:07 - minute they realize they're actually
06:08 - paying more in taxes than
06:11 - you know whatever they're paying for
06:12 - that number two bill or usually they
06:14 - might even be paying more in taxes than
06:15 - what they're paying for housing okay so
06:18 - your taxes really are just a really
06:19 - large amount of money that you know
06:22 - you're paying out all the time um during
06:23 - the course of the year and by by me
06:25 - mindful of that you can get that tax
06:28 - bill down
06:29 - which leaves a lot of money in your
06:31 - pocket at the end of the year because
06:33 - it's really important to just be mindful
06:34 - of the fact that
06:36 - it's really hard to get ahead if
06:37 - somebody's just taking a huge chunk
06:39 - right off the top right
06:40 - so
06:42 - really be thinking of how do i get my
06:44 - tax bill down and that's what we're
06:45 - going to be getting into a little bit
06:48 - over the course of this video
06:51 - by being mindful of your taxes
06:54 - i really do think you you will find that
06:56 - you can get ahead financially in this
06:58 - world a lot faster than
07:00 - you would otherwise because again as i
07:02 - said a moment ago it's hard to get ahead
07:04 - when somebody's uh you know taking a
07:07 - chunk off the top
07:09 - but one thing but to be mindful of and i
07:11 - know i'm going to catch a lot of flack
07:13 - and might even get some negative
07:14 - comments over saying this is that a lot
07:17 - of today's discussion about
07:20 - income inequality and a lack of
07:21 - opportunity and things of that nature
07:23 - kind of misses the point when it comes
07:26 - to the us tax
07:28 - code know a lot of people think the tax
07:31 - code is in in the united states is set
07:32 - up to favor wealthy people and things of
07:34 - that nature the u.s tax code is actually
07:37 - not set up to favor individuals it's set
07:39 - up to favor activities okay it is set
07:42 - set up to favor people who run
07:44 - businesses and who invest all right so
07:47 - if you're not running your own business
07:49 - which you know as a freelancer you're
07:50 - running your own business
07:52 - but if you're not running a business
07:53 - which even if it's a solo business and
07:55 - if you're not investing you're going to
07:57 - wind up paying a lot more in taxes so by
08:00 - going the freelance route being mindful
08:02 - of your taxes and investing you can
08:04 - really get that tax bill down and you
08:06 - will just keep a really much larger
08:08 - proportion of
08:10 - what it is you're making and as a result
08:13 - of that you have more money to invest
08:16 - and then that allows you to get ahead
08:19 - financially okay
08:21 - don't fall into the trap of thinking
08:23 - that
08:24 - uh worrying about one's taxes is
08:27 - something that financially comfortable
08:29 - people do okay
08:30 - financially comfortable people
08:32 - don't worry about their taxes because
08:34 - they're financially comfortable one of
08:35 - the big reasons they're financially
08:37 - comfortable is because they worry about
08:39 - their taxes okay so by engaging in
08:42 - activities such as working for yourself
08:44 - and investing which we're going to get
08:45 - into in this video you can really get
08:47 - your tax bill down and get yourself in a
08:49 - better spot all right so be very mindful
08:52 - of your taxes understand it's one of
08:54 - your biggest expenses and understand you
08:55 - have a lot of control over
08:57 - how much you pay like in taxes you just
08:59 - need to be mindful of it and it's
09:01 - something you need to always be thinking
09:03 - about i mean
09:04 - if you're watching this video chances
09:06 - are you think about other expenses you
09:07 - think of how do i get my housing bill
09:09 - down how do i get my gas bill down how
09:11 - do i get any number of bills down start
09:14 - thinking that same way when it comes to
09:16 - what you're paying out in taxes
09:18 - during the course of the year so
09:20 - with all that being said let's look at
09:23 - some important concepts that we need to
09:25 - get our arms around in order to
09:27 - understand
09:28 - how you can get your tax bills down
09:39 - okay so there's a few different concepts
09:40 - we need to look at to like i said
09:43 - earlier get our arms around how the tax
09:45 - system works so we can then understand
09:47 - how to save money on taxes as a
09:49 - self-employed developer or a freelancer
09:51 - of any kind for that matter it doesn't
09:53 - matter if you're freelance writer uh
09:54 - freelance developer
09:56 - uh
09:58 - freelance you name it
09:59 - these all these same tax rules are going
10:01 - to apply so this is relevant to anybody
10:04 - who's self-employed
10:06 - so these concepts we need to get our
10:08 - hands around that a lot of people
10:11 - may struggle with or just simply be
10:12 - unaware of is number one understanding
10:15 - the difference between revenue and
10:17 - income number two
10:19 - understanding how an employee is taxed
10:22 - versus how businesses and business
10:24 - owners specifically are taxed
10:26 - number three we need to look at an
10:28 - explanation of the different kinds of
10:30 - taxes that we have here in the united
10:33 - states we have federal taxes state taxes
10:34 - local taxes and they even those get
10:36 - broken up into various subsets um also
10:40 - we need to understand how graduated tax
10:41 - brackets work and then also we need to
10:44 - understand the differences between
10:46 - taxes paid dur for the year and in taxes
10:49 - paid in during the year which are two
10:51 - different things so
10:54 - like i said these are all concepts that
10:55 - if you ask people about them they may
10:57 - not really be able to explain it very
10:59 - well or they just may not be
11:01 - aware of how they work
11:03 - so let's take a look at each of these in
11:05 - turn okay so
11:07 - in terms of understanding the difference
11:10 - between one's revenue and one's income
11:13 - okay
11:14 - when you work for yourself
11:16 - revenue is what comes in the door so in
11:19 - other words
11:20 - if you're building an app for somebody
11:22 - um if you're a freelance writer and
11:24 - you're writing like an ebook for
11:25 - somebody and they pay you five thousand
11:28 - dollars to do it
11:30 - you have made five thousand dollars in
11:32 - revenue however you have expenses in
11:36 - running your business okay so let's say
11:38 - you have five hundred dollars in
11:39 - expenses a hundred dollars whatever in
11:41 - expenses and running your business that
11:44 - revenue
11:45 - minus those expenses is your profit or
11:48 - otherwise your income so your income is
11:51 - not what you bring in it is what you
11:53 - keep which is uh your revenue minus your
11:56 - expenses so i'm gonna put up a slide and
11:59 - as you can see uh my slides are not
12:01 - exactly a work of art um i also don't in
12:04 - addition to not holding myself out as a
12:06 - tax professional i don't hold myself out
12:08 - um as an artist but under our example
12:11 - here
12:12 - if someone brings in again using
12:15 - uh my example from earlier let's say you
12:17 - bring in five thousand dollars in
12:18 - revenue so in other words someone pays
12:20 - you five thousand dollars to do work
12:22 - uh during for the month let's say and
12:25 - then during the month you spend two
12:27 - hundred dollars
12:28 - in advertising
12:30 - you pay out fifty dollars for uh let's
12:33 - say business insurance let's say you pay
12:35 - out fifty dollars for software
12:36 - subscriptions aws maybe a g suite
12:38 - account things of that sort so in other
12:41 - words after your revenue and then your
12:43 - three hundred dollars of expenses your
12:45 - net income is forty seven hundred
12:47 - dollars
12:48 - so what you made was not five thousand
12:50 - dollars which you made was forty seven
12:52 - hundred dollars okay
12:54 - and i talk to self-employed people all
12:56 - the time that if you ask them what they
12:57 - make
12:58 - they actually tell you their revenue
13:00 - number
13:01 - as their income not their profit which
13:05 - if they're reporting their taxes that
13:06 - way
13:07 - then they are paying way too much in
13:09 - taxes because they're paying taxes on
13:11 - five thousand dollars worth of income
13:12 - worse versus forty seven hundred dollars
13:14 - worth of income and you're only actually
13:17 - required to pay taxes on your income not
13:19 - your revenue so it's really important
13:21 - that you understand the difference
13:22 - between uh revenue
13:24 - and profit slash net income and that
13:27 - you're reporting that
13:29 - correctly okay so remember you pay taxes
13:32 - on your income not your revenue and it's
13:34 - important that
13:36 - you understand uh the difference between
13:38 - the two
13:40 - another thing to really understand is
13:43 - the difference in how you're taxed when
13:45 - you're an employee versus when you're a
13:49 - business owner
13:50 - if you're an employee in the united
13:52 - states that means you get a w-2 at the
13:54 - end of the year you get a paycheck every
13:55 - week every two weeks
13:57 - and you are the most taxed individual in
13:59 - the united states okay because
14:02 - employees in the united states they get
14:04 - taxed on uh they pay federal income tax
14:07 - on all their income they pay social
14:10 - security tax otherwise known as fica and
14:12 - medicare on essentially um all their
14:15 - income
14:17 - and they also pay state and local income
14:18 - tax on if if that's applicable on
14:21 - all of their income so when you're an
14:23 - employee
14:24 - yeah you're getting a paycheck
14:25 - and
14:26 - uh you know your taxes get taken out of
14:29 - it and you're being taxed on a higher
14:30 - percentage of your income than people
14:32 - that work for
14:34 - work for themselves so
14:36 - but if you are
14:38 - getting a paycheck from somebody and
14:39 - getting a w-2 you are
14:42 - an employee okay um
14:45 - now that is being an employee is
14:47 - different than being a
14:49 - self-employed person a freelancer slash
14:52 - business owner because when you're a
14:53 - freelancer you really are just a
14:55 - business owner and even if you're only
14:57 - even if you're the only one
14:59 - in your business
15:00 - so
15:02 - for the purposes of our discussion um in
15:04 - this course we're really going to look
15:06 - at uh three different kinds of business
15:08 - structures that exist in the united
15:11 - states one is a sole proprietorship
15:14 - which a lot of um
15:17 - freelance workers are going to go this
15:18 - route a sole proprietorship is just at
15:20 - its sole meaning you know
15:22 - you haven't gone out and formed an
15:24 - actual company you're just doing it as
15:26 - an individual
15:27 - maybe you got some people working for
15:28 - you but typically not a sole proprietor
15:30 - is usually just
15:32 - themselves um you know and they haven't
15:34 - formed a separate entity they haven't
15:36 - formed a business
15:39 - like they haven't started like a
15:40 - corporation or an llc or something like
15:42 - that so the first kind of business form
15:44 - we're gonna look at is a sole proprietor
15:46 - and again that's just you have not
15:47 - started a separate entity okay the
15:50 - second kind that we're gonna look at is
15:52 - an llc which is a limited liability
15:55 - company
15:56 - as a poll as opposed to a sole
15:59 - proprietorship an llc is an actual
16:01 - separate entity an llc can buy property
16:04 - sell property
16:06 - has its own bank accounts things of that
16:08 - nature so if you form an el if you're
16:10 - working for yourself and you form an llc
16:13 - then uh you have formed an actual legal
16:16 - entity that you're doing business
16:17 - through
16:18 - uh the third kind of
16:20 - business structure i want to look at is
16:22 - what's called an s corporation um i'll
16:26 - spare you why it's called an s
16:27 - corporation but
16:29 - you can actually uh choose to have your
16:31 - llc taxed as if it were an escort s
16:34 - corporation you don't have to
16:37 - form an s corporation you can form an
16:39 - llc and elect to have that treated as an
16:41 - s corporation we'll talk that a little
16:43 - bit later in the video
16:45 - so for tax purposes
16:48 - if you're working for yourself chances
16:50 - are you're either going to be taxed as a
16:52 - sole proprietorship you're going to be
16:54 - taxed as uh through an llc or you're
16:57 - going to be taxed through an s
16:58 - corporation okay those are the three
17:00 - main that you're going to be
17:02 - falling under if you are uh working for
17:06 - yourself
17:07 - so
17:08 - again if you're an employee
17:10 - you get a paycheck
17:12 - your employer manages all your
17:13 - withholdings you're paying taxes on all
17:16 - of that
17:17 - if you are working for yourself you're
17:19 - probably either a sole proprietor an llc
17:22 - or an llc being taxed as an s
17:24 - corporation and you actually
17:27 - get some tax breaks that way by
17:30 - structuring your business okay
17:32 - so
17:33 - understanding in addition to
17:35 - understanding the difference between uh
17:37 - revenue and income you need to
17:39 - understand the difference between being
17:40 - an employee and being a business owner
17:42 - okay
17:43 - um
17:44 - the third thing we really need to
17:46 - understand in terms of core concepts is
17:49 - that there are different levels of
17:50 - taxation in the united states a lot of
17:54 - people talk about
17:55 - their taxes and lump it all into
17:58 - just kind of one bucket again there are
18:01 - different levels of taxation in the
18:03 - united states first the federal
18:05 - government
18:07 - is someone you're going to be paying
18:08 - money to
18:09 - and you're going to pay that in the form
18:11 - of federal income tax federal income tax
18:13 - is what the government uses to run
18:15 - operations things like
18:17 - run government offices fund the military
18:21 - things of that nature so your federal
18:23 - income tax you pay the federal
18:25 - government that funds the government on
18:27 - a day-to-day basis
18:28 - you also you also pay fica which social
18:31 - security and medicare tax to the federal
18:33 - government those specifically go for
18:35 - funding social security payments to
18:37 - people and uh funding the medicare
18:40 - system so those are all taxes you pay
18:43 - just to the federal government federal
18:44 - income tax fica and medicare
18:47 - but then you're also going to be paying
18:50 - state income tax in some states not
18:52 - others okay it depends where you live
18:54 - uh like if you live in uh
18:59 - california for example you're gonna be
19:00 - paying income tax to the state some
19:02 - states don't like nevada don't require
19:04 - the payment of any state income tax and
19:07 - in
19:08 - some states uh if your cell phone there
19:11 - might be a state income tax but if
19:13 - you're self-employed there's no state
19:14 - income tax we'll get into all that in a
19:16 - little while but for right now
19:18 - understand that there are different
19:19 - levels of taxation there's federal
19:20 - taxation which can be broken off in
19:22 - several subsets there's state level
19:25 - taxation
19:27 - and then you might even also pay local
19:28 - taxation so if you live in the wrong
19:30 - place you might be paying federal income
19:32 - tax you might be paying income taxes
19:34 - state you live in and then you might be
19:35 - paying some form of income tax to the
19:37 - city you live in
19:38 - on top of that
19:41 - so the third core concept that we need
19:44 - to understand
19:45 - is that the federal tax system works
19:48 - through what are called graduated
19:50 - brackets all right you might hear people
19:53 - all the time say things like oh i'm in
19:55 - the 22 tax bracket or they'll spit out a
19:58 - number
19:58 - and there tends to be a lot of
20:00 - misunderstanding about what a tax
20:02 - bracket means
20:04 - if you were to tell somebody again i'm
20:06 - just using the numbers to prove a point
20:08 - if you were telling somebody hey i'm in
20:09 - the 22 tax bracket that person might
20:12 - think that means you pay
20:14 - 22 of all of your income to the federal
20:18 - government okay
20:19 - but that is not how uh tax brackets work
20:23 - and for to understand tax brackets i'm
20:26 - going to put up a different slide
20:28 - and again here's another one of my ugly
20:29 - slides
20:30 - the u.s tax brackets are for the federal
20:33 - system are graduated and by that i mean
20:36 - uh
20:37 - up to a certain point you'll pay a
20:40 - certain rate and then after that you'll
20:41 - pay another rate and then after that
20:43 - you'll pay another rate and so on so
20:44 - forth so
20:46 - under my scenario here let's say
20:48 - somebody's making forty thousand five
20:51 - hundred and twenty five dollars for the
20:53 - year in taxable income again their
20:54 - taxable income is forty thousand
20:56 - five hundred and twenty five dollars
20:58 - what you'll see is in the united states
21:00 - this is for 2021
21:02 - again the 2021 tax year
21:05 - you would pay 10 percent
21:07 - of your first 9 950
21:11 - in federal income tax
21:13 - okay any income after nine thousand
21:16 - nine hundred and fifty dollars would get
21:19 - taxed at twelve percent so in other
21:21 - words the twelve percent bracket starts
21:24 - at nine thousand nine hundred and fifty
21:27 - one dollars so that nine thousand nine
21:29 - and 950 first dollar
21:31 - would have 12 cents taken out of it for
21:33 - federal income tax okay so in other
21:35 - words these brackets are graduated so
21:38 - if you're whenever you hear somebody say
21:41 - you know i'm in the 22 tax bracket for
21:43 - exam example that means some of their
21:45 - income they paid ten percent at some of
21:47 - their income they paid at a higher
21:48 - bracket some of their income they paid
21:50 - at a higher bracket
21:51 - and it's not really um
21:54 - it's not accurate to say all their
21:56 - income was taxed at 22 percent
21:58 - what it is is that their highest uh
22:01 - bracket they broke into
22:03 - was 22 percent of somebody saying
22:04 - they're in the 22 bracket
22:07 - this slide is all of the irs tax
22:10 - brackets for 2021. so you can see your
22:14 - first 9 950 of taxable income is taxed
22:17 - at a rate of 10
22:18 - income between taxable income between
22:21 - 99.50 and 45.25
22:24 - is taxed at 12 percent
22:26 - okay
22:27 - um income between 45 25 and 86 375 is
22:32 - taxed at 22
22:34 - and so on and so on and so on so again
22:38 - as you can see if someone were to tell
22:39 - you
22:40 - hey i'm taxed in the 37 bracket
22:44 - all they're saying is that they had inco
22:46 - taxable income of over 523 601 dollars
22:50 - and some of their income was taxed at 37
22:55 - so understand that tax brackets are
22:57 - graduated and you pay a portion of your
23:00 - income at different rates okay
23:02 - um
23:04 - but there tends to be a lot of
23:05 - misunderstanding when it comes to tax
23:07 - brackets and how that works it's really
23:09 - important you understand that graduated
23:11 - structure and that earning a certain
23:12 - amount
23:13 - can push you
23:15 - into a higher bracket and if you keep
23:16 - your income down you stay at a lower
23:18 - bracket okay
23:20 - and keep your income down by capturing
23:21 - deductions which we'll get into
23:23 - shortly
23:24 - um the last core concept that we need to
23:28 - understand is the difference between
23:30 - taxes paid for the year and taxes paid
23:33 - in during the year these are two
23:35 - different things so
23:37 - a lot of people
23:38 - when they get their paycheck from their
23:40 - employer
23:41 - and i'm just making up numbers to prove
23:43 - the point they see that their employer
23:46 - held uh
23:48 - you know 500 out of their paycheck for
23:50 - taxes they think they paid 500 in taxes
23:54 - what they did is they paid in
23:56 - 500
23:58 - in taxes for uh towards their annual tax
24:00 - bill at the end of the year when you
24:03 - complete your 1040 form
24:05 - that 1040 form is going to say
24:07 - here's what you earned
24:09 - here's what your tax obligation is based
24:11 - on what you earned
24:13 - and then it's going to look at what you
24:15 - paid in during the year which are those
24:16 - withholdings if you're a w-2 employee
24:19 - and if you paid in more than your tax
24:22 - obligation you get a refund back for the
24:24 - difference if you paid in less
24:27 - than the tax obligation then you owe the
24:30 - government the difference okay so paying
24:34 - in taxes during the year is not paying
24:36 - your taxes you don't know what you uh
24:39 - pay in taxes until you do your 1040 at
24:41 - the end of the year and again what you
24:43 - what your tax obligation is is then
24:45 - charged against whatever you paid in
24:49 - during the year so understanding the
24:50 - difference between what you're paying in
24:51 - during the year
24:53 - and the fact that your tax obligation is
24:54 - not calculated until the end of the year
24:57 - is a very important concept
25:00 - you know for people to understand all
25:03 - right so
25:04 - uh now that we've been over
25:07 - each of those things
25:08 - uh you'll remember a moment ago we
25:10 - talked about there are different ways
25:12 - you can structure your business as i was
25:14 - saying you can either be a sole
25:15 - proprietor an llc or you can be taxed as
25:17 - an s corporation
25:20 - now
25:21 - while all those structures have benefits
25:24 - uh that exceed being a w2 employee there
25:28 - are different levels of taxation and tax
25:30 - breaks that can apply to
25:32 - those different kinds of businesses
25:34 - so let's take a look at how each of
25:36 - those different kinds of entities are
25:38 - taxed okay and understanding how those
25:41 - entities are taxed can go a long way
25:43 - towards helping you understand how you
25:45 - want to structure your
25:54 - business okay in the last part of our
25:57 - video we talked about the three kinds of
25:59 - business structures you can have
26:00 - generally speaking if you're going to be
26:03 - a freelance developer freelancer of any
26:06 - kind and those business structures are
26:08 - typically going to be either a sole
26:09 - proprietorship
26:11 - forming an llc
26:12 - or forming an llc uh with what's called
26:15 - an s corporation election okay so in
26:18 - this part of the video we're going to
26:20 - look at
26:21 - the tax benefits and consequences of
26:24 - each of those and before we do that
26:26 - though it's important to understand
26:27 - something called the qualified business
26:29 - income deduction so the first thing i'm
26:31 - going to do is explain the qualified
26:33 - business income deduction which is
26:34 - commonly referred to as the qbi and then
26:37 - we're going to look at again the
26:39 - consequences of
26:41 - how
26:42 - of choosing one of those different
26:43 - business structures and see what kind of
26:45 - benefits you get on your taxes for that
26:48 - the first thing to understand in this is
26:50 - the qualified business income deduction
26:53 - the qbi came about as part of the 2017
26:56 - tax cut jobs act
26:58 - in other words the tax cut law that was
26:59 - passed in 2017 created the qbi which is
27:02 - something new to the u.s tax code and
27:05 - what the qbi does is
27:08 - it for self-employed people
27:11 - it makes the first 20
27:13 - of your business profit
27:15 - non-taxable generally speaking there are
27:17 - some exceptions to this but as long as
27:20 - your total income for the year
27:23 - from all sources
27:24 - is less than one hundred and sixty four
27:26 - thousand nine hundred dollars for twenty
27:28 - twenty one
27:29 - you will not pay federal income tax on
27:33 - the first 20
27:35 - of any income that is uh related to your
27:38 - freelance business again generally
27:40 - speaking okay
27:41 - so
27:42 - uh
27:43 - what how does this work in practice so
27:46 - to understand this i'm going to go ahead
27:48 - and put up another one of my ugly slides
27:50 - i am a better web developer than a slide
27:53 - maker but again this is just a really
27:56 - simplified breakdown of
27:58 - the qualified business income deduction
28:00 - for someone in 2021.
28:03 - let's say somebody was a freelance
28:04 - developer and they had no source of
28:06 - income other than their freelance
28:08 - business
28:09 - they earned a hundred thousand dollars
28:11 - in revenue you know we talked about
28:13 - revenue earlier that's the total of what
28:14 - came into the business
28:16 - but then the business had expenses on
28:18 - top of that so let's say you had one
28:19 - expense that was five thousand dollars
28:21 - you had another expense that was five
28:23 - thousand dollars
28:25 - so
28:26 - you have net income of ninety thousand
28:28 - dollars okay
28:30 - but the thing is while somebody who's
28:32 - earning a w-2 is going to be looking at
28:35 - federal income tax on ninety thousand
28:36 - dollars worth of income
28:38 - if you're self-employed and you get to
28:40 - take that qbi deduction
28:43 - you take the first twenty percent off so
28:45 - you only pay federal income tax towards
28:48 - seventy two thousand dollars not towards
28:50 - the ninety thousand dollars in other in
28:52 - other words the simplest way to think of
28:54 - this is that the first twenty percent of
28:56 - business related income for a freelance
28:57 - developer gets skipped out of federal
29:00 - income tax okay which can really go
29:03 - a long ways
29:04 - so
29:05 - the qbi
29:07 - is going to apply to all levels of
29:09 - self-employment whether you're a sole
29:10 - proprietor whether you're running an llc
29:12 - or whether you're being taxed as ns
29:14 - corporation okay
29:17 - so just by running your own business in
29:19 - general you're going to get a big tax
29:21 - break over somebody who is working a w-2
29:24 - job
29:25 - due to the qbi
29:27 - so now that we've talked about how the
29:30 - qbi works let's understand some of the
29:32 - benefits of and detriments i should say
29:35 - along with the benefits of these
29:37 - different business structures
29:39 - if you're a sole proprietor
29:42 - you have taken the easiest route for
29:45 - starting your business okay a sole
29:47 - proprietor is somebody who is doing
29:51 - freelance jobs on the side uh on a
29:53 - continuous basis and getting a 1099 at
29:56 - the end of the year
29:58 - and or somebody who has
30:00 - gotten a general business license and
30:02 - started a trade name but they haven't
30:04 - gone out and actually started a company
30:05 - in other words they just went to the
30:06 - secretary of state's office and got
30:09 - their business license started their
30:10 - trade name
30:11 - and um you know they're running
30:14 - everything that way those that is the
30:17 - easiest way to start up that is the
30:20 - least expensive way to start up that is
30:22 - the way to start up that involves the uh
30:25 - least amount of paperwork okay
30:27 - um so either the 1099 route or the
30:31 - actually getting a business license is
30:34 - what a lot of people are going to do
30:37 - when you do that
30:39 - you get to take the qbi on your profit
30:41 - meaning
30:42 - uh you know your profit and your
30:44 - business is your income minus your
30:46 - expenses and then you're only going to
30:47 - pay taxes on eighty percent of that
30:50 - profit that's federal income tax
30:53 - you will pay self-employment tax which
30:56 - is the equivalent of medicare and
30:57 - medicaid
30:58 - on
30:59 - uh all of your income okay so under the
31:02 - scenario i put up a minute ago if
31:04 - somebody's earning ninety thousand
31:06 - dollars after their expenses they'll pay
31:08 - employment taxes on the whole 90 000 in
31:10 - federal income tax on 72 000 they'll
31:13 - also be subject to state and local
31:15 - income tax depending on where they are
31:18 - so
31:19 - sole proprietorship
31:21 - is going to mean
31:23 - the least amount of hassle and
31:25 - aggravation getting started you're going
31:28 - to save on taxes um because of your qbi
31:32 - and there really aren't going to be any
31:34 - benefits to it after that okay
31:38 - if you form an llc
31:40 - you have formed a separate actual entity
31:43 - an llc is a legal entity um apart from
31:47 - its owner okay it's it's a company it
31:50 - can
31:51 - buy property and sell property in its
31:53 - own name things things of that nature
31:55 - uh it gives you liability protection
31:58 - there are other benefits that come with
32:00 - owning an llc
32:01 - if you do an llc
32:03 - and
32:04 - choose to not have it taxed as an
32:07 - s-corporation
32:09 - then all the money from the llc on your
32:11 - te will flow through to you on your tax
32:13 - return the llc pays no taxes during the
32:15 - year
32:16 - so what will happen here is if the llc
32:19 - has
32:20 - ninety thousand dollars
32:22 - in profit
32:23 - the owner of the llc will then report
32:25 - ninety thousand dollars of income on
32:26 - their personal tax return
32:28 - okay
32:30 - there are benefits to owning an llc
32:32 - outside of taxes those benefits include
32:35 - liability protection uh you know the
32:38 - ability to bring in partners easily
32:41 - things of that sort
32:42 - but for tax purposes
32:44 - owning the llc
32:46 - and being a sole proprietor if you're a
32:48 - freelancer really aren't going to be
32:51 - that different
32:52 - you'll get the qbi deduction which again
32:55 - saves you money over having a w-2 job
32:58 - but you're also going to pay
32:59 - self-employment taxes which are the
33:00 - equivalent of medicare and medicaid
33:04 - so
33:05 - tax consequence wise
33:07 - llc
33:08 - with no s corp election and sole
33:10 - proprietor
33:12 - both better than getting a w2 job
33:14 - and
33:15 - uh
33:17 - you know not not much else other than
33:19 - that qbi benefit keep in mind with the
33:22 - llc
33:23 - you have started an actual company which
33:25 - means there's more paperwork and hoops
33:26 - to jump through to maintain that than
33:28 - just being a sole proprietor
33:31 - the third step on the spectrum we've
33:32 - been talking about would be to form an
33:34 - llc and have it taxed as
33:37 - as if it were an s corporation
33:39 - what happens when you do this is
33:42 - you form an llc the company is an llc
33:46 - but the irs
33:47 - kind of just says for tax purposes only
33:50 - we're going to pretend as if it's an s
33:52 - corporation
33:53 - and what happens when you own an s
33:55 - corporation is you are an employee and
33:58 - the owner of the business simultaneously
34:02 - so
34:02 - as the employee you have to pay yourself
34:05 - a reasonable salary and i gotta stress
34:06 - the reasonable part you can't just pay
34:08 - yourself a dollar you've got to pay
34:10 - what someone doing the work you do would
34:12 - reasonably make so if a reasonable
34:15 - reasonable developer salary sixty
34:16 - thousand dollars
34:18 - you need to pay yourself a salary of 60
34:20 - 000
34:22 - that salary will be taxed like any other
34:25 - paycheck would for a w-2 employee
34:27 - because again you've got to pay that
34:29 - salary through
34:30 - a payroll service or something of the
34:32 - sort so you're going to pay taxes on
34:34 - that just like any employee would
34:37 - the profits however on top of the salary
34:41 - in an s corp is where you really start
34:43 - to see the tax benefits of this because
34:45 - those profits are subject to the qbi
34:48 - meaning that the first 20 of those
34:50 - profits
34:51 - are not subject to any federal income
34:53 - tax
34:55 - those profits are also completely exempt
34:57 - from self-employment taxes meaning you
34:59 - will pay
35:01 - nothing equivalent to social security
35:03 - medicare medicaid on that
35:05 - so
35:06 - no employment taxes
35:08 - and
35:09 - only federal income tax on 80
35:11 - of those profits
35:13 - so if you have your reasonable salary
35:15 - and a lot of profits
35:17 - on top of that
35:19 - this all this profit
35:22 - is really tax advantage because you're
35:24 - paying no social security medicare
35:26 - medicaid on any of that
35:28 - and you're only paying federal income
35:29 - tax on 80 of that
35:33 - the downsides of an s-corporation is
35:35 - again you've got to pay yourself a
35:38 - reasonable salary as an employee meaning
35:40 - you've got go through all the paperwork
35:42 - that goes with having an employee
35:44 - yourself
35:46 - so we pay a service uh intuit full
35:48 - service payroll to manage that for us
35:50 - because we are taxed as an s-corporation
35:53 - um i'm going to link to uh intuit merch
35:56 - full-service payroll i should say into
35:57 - it full service payroll will be linked
35:59 - to
36:00 - below um so in other words there's
36:02 - expense if you're gonna run an s corp
36:04 - there's expense you have to incur mainly
36:05 - the payroll service and there's hoops
36:07 - you have to jump through
36:09 - uh and you know and and regulations you
36:11 - have to deal to deal with in running
36:13 - that
36:14 - so your income
36:16 - needs to be high enough
36:17 - to justify the expense and the
36:20 - aggravation of running the s corp so
36:23 - really if you're going to run a sole
36:24 - proprietorship if you're going to run an
36:27 - llc
36:28 - or if you're going to run an s
36:30 - corporation depends on how much you're
36:32 - trying to grow your business okay if
36:34 - you're just doing the occasional project
36:36 - here and there on the side it might be a
36:38 - thing where a sole proprietorship is
36:41 - best for you
36:42 - if you are engaging a more regular
36:44 - business
36:46 - activity and you really want to grow
36:47 - your business um you know you might need
36:50 - an llc
36:51 - if you know and if you're really for
36:53 - seeing a lot of profits then you know
36:55 - you might want to do an s corporation
36:58 - these are all things to talk about with
37:00 - an accountant just be mindful of the
37:02 - fact that the higher you go up that
37:04 - ladder from sole proprietor to llc to s
37:06 - corp the more potential you have for
37:08 - business flexibility and tax savings
37:10 - okay as you work your way up that
37:14 - uh which one to pick really just depends
37:16 - on
37:17 - your particular situation and those are
37:18 - things you really need to discuss with a
37:22 - tax professional so
37:24 - now that we've talked about all that
37:26 - let's understand what tax deductions are
37:29 - and look at the importance of making
37:30 - sure you're taking all your tax
37:32 - deductions
37:42 - okay now we're going to talk about the
37:44 - importance of tax deductions and making
37:45 - sure that you're maximizing them
37:48 - again there are a lot of deductions
37:49 - available for uh small business owners
37:52 - aka you as a freelancer so in this part
37:56 - of our video we're going to look at a
37:59 - understanding exactly what deductions
38:01 - are and why they're important
38:04 - then we're going to be looking at
38:05 - expenses for your business that can be
38:07 - deducted there are obviously
38:09 - more common ones that people don't miss
38:11 - but you are a lot of ones that do get
38:13 - missed we're going to make sure that
38:14 - you're not missing those and then the
38:16 - other thing is we're going to look at
38:17 - how you can be maximizing
38:19 - your retirement savings as a form of a
38:21 - tax deduction and that can greatly
38:23 - subsidize
38:24 - your retirement investments okay so
38:27 - let's take a look at each of these in
38:29 - turn the first thing to do is to
38:32 - understand the concept of a deduction in
38:35 - general and for this i am going to put
38:38 - our slide back up
38:40 - on revenue versus income that we talked
38:43 - about earlier in this video you'll
38:46 - recall we said that
38:48 - revenue is everything you bring into
38:50 - your business so every in other words
38:52 - this is everything your customer pays
38:54 - you but your net income is what you
38:56 - actually pay taxes on you don't pay
38:58 - taxes on revenue you pay taxes on income
39:01 - so let's just say for example somebody
39:04 - brought in five thousand dollars but
39:06 - then they didn't write off their
39:07 - expenses of advertising insurance and
39:09 - software subscriptions that means
39:11 - they're paying taxes on five thousand
39:13 - dollars even though they only made forty
39:15 - seven hundred dollars so they're paying
39:17 - more taxes than they really should be
39:19 - paying which means they're donating
39:21 - money to the government and that's how i
39:23 - want you to think of it not capturing
39:25 - legitimate deductions is essentially
39:28 - donating money to the government and
39:30 - under our little scenario here
39:32 - advertising insurance and software
39:33 - subscriptions are deducted from revenue
39:37 - that's what a deduction is you are
39:39 - deducting
39:40 - something from your business income you
39:42 - are deducting something from your
39:44 - taxable income to arrive at the number
39:46 - that you're actually going to pay taxes
39:48 - on so a tax deduction
39:50 - lowers the amount of income
39:52 - that you are
39:54 - going to be paying taxes on
39:56 - so what are deductions it for a business
39:59 - owner again
40:00 - there are some that are a lot more
40:03 - obvious there are some that are less
40:04 - obvious okay
40:06 - what you want to do to make sure you're
40:07 - capturing all your deductions is er on
40:10 - the side of making sure or i guess i
40:13 - should say er on the side of thinking
40:15 - it's deductible
40:16 - and then let your accountant figure it
40:18 - out
40:19 - because if you have an expense here
40:22 - doesn't matter what the expense is but
40:23 - you don't tell your accountant about it
40:26 - your accountant has no way of ever
40:27 - deducting it off of your taxes right
40:30 - so what you're better off doing is just
40:31 - making sure
40:33 - you put all your expenses in all your
40:35 - business expenses into your bookkeeping
40:38 - and let your accountant tell you hey
40:40 - this is not tax deductible okay you're
40:42 - better off giving your accountant all
40:44 - the potential deductions and then
40:46 - letting your accountant decide what is
40:48 - and what is a deductible versus you not
40:50 - giving the accountant all the
40:52 - information and then potentially missing
40:53 - a deduction as a result of it and if you
40:55 - miss that deduction again you pay
40:57 - extra in taxes
40:59 - okay so
41:00 - er on the side of assuming things are
41:02 - deductible when you're doing your
41:04 - bookkeeping and putting your expenses in
41:06 - there and let your accountant straighten
41:08 - that out
41:09 - for you this is also
41:12 - on a quick side note why it's so
41:13 - important to be doing your bookkeeping
41:16 - on a regular basis so make sure you're
41:18 - keeping your book straight because if
41:20 - your books aren't straight chances are
41:22 - you are
41:23 - overstating your income and again paying
41:25 - too much in taxes
41:27 - so now that we know what deductions are
41:30 - and we know the importance of getting
41:32 - them submitted to your accountant let's
41:34 - talk about expenses in your business
41:36 - which can be deducted and for this i'm
41:39 - going to look at ones that are commonly
41:40 - deducted in other words most people know
41:42 - to deduct them but then i'm also going
41:44 - to look at ones that are
41:46 - less commonly taken because some people
41:47 - may not understand that they can take
41:49 - the deduction
41:51 - so your common ones are pretty obvious
41:54 - right if you rent uh any kind of office
41:57 - or workspace for your business then
41:59 - you're gonna deduct your office rent if
42:01 - you pay utilities at that office you can
42:04 - deduct that you can deduct services you
42:06 - have to pay for so
42:08 - if um
42:10 - you're paying for aws
42:12 - in your business to host and maintain
42:14 - stuff for your customers um then that is
42:18 - an ex that aws expense is something
42:20 - you're going to
42:22 - uh deduct out of your revenue when
42:24 - you're arriving at your income any
42:27 - services you pay for in your business
42:30 - are going to be tax deductible um aws
42:33 - um if you're paying for office software
42:35 - like google workspace or office 365
42:39 - would be an easy one software
42:41 - subscriptions um
42:43 - uh you know like if you do
42:46 - if you're a freelance web developer and
42:47 - you also do a lot of graphics work uh
42:50 - for your clients um you know like your
42:52 - subscriptions to
42:54 - um a service like adobe you know for
42:56 - adobe photoshop and whatnot is going to
42:58 - be tax deductible so your services
43:01 - various services that you're paying for
43:02 - pretty much always going to be
43:03 - deductible one with things like rent
43:04 - utilities uh liability insurance things
43:07 - like that
43:09 - those are the pretty easy ones and most
43:11 - people know to deduct those and they
43:13 - don't miss those however
43:15 - there are a lot of common deductions
43:18 - that are missed in other words
43:20 - deductions can't that people can be
43:21 - taken
43:22 - taking which will lower their taxable
43:24 - income which will result in them paying
43:26 - less taxes but they just miss the
43:28 - deductions they don't know to take them
43:30 - so
43:30 - let's look at what a few of those are
43:33 - and there's a bunch of them but we're
43:35 - just going to go over a few
43:36 - one of them is mileage and travel um
43:41 - under the
43:43 - tax cut act of 2017 that created the
43:46 - qualified business income deduction or
43:48 - qbi that we talked about earlier the
43:51 - ability of business owners to
43:54 - write off their mileage got reduced
43:56 - quite a bit however one thing you can
43:59 - still do to write off your mileage is if
44:02 - you are being taxed as an s corporation
44:04 - which we are in our business
44:06 - um if you're being taxed as an s
44:08 - corporation it is possible to write off
44:11 - any mileage that's work related and you
44:13 - do this by
44:15 - having the business which you own
44:17 - write a check to the employee which is
44:19 - you
44:21 - for the for the mileage incurred
44:24 - that becomes tax deductible to the
44:26 - business
44:27 - but because it's a reimbursement the
44:28 - employee doesn't get taxed on it so in
44:30 - other words it's deducted on the
44:31 - business side
44:33 - and not taxed on the employee side which
44:35 - means it becomes tax deductible okay and
44:38 - for 2021
44:39 - if you're driving for work you can
44:42 - do that at the rate of 56 cents per mile
44:44 - now driving to and from your office in
44:46 - other words your daily commute is not
44:48 - tax deductible but let's say you got a
44:50 - drive to a customer's office for
44:52 - a meeting you gotta drive to best buy to
44:55 - buy a new computer for work um you know
44:58 - you need to buy drive to another vendor
45:00 - somewhere you uh
45:02 - you know uh you you're driving around
45:05 - with a customer to show a customer
45:07 - potential ideas or something like that
45:09 - though you can write all that mileage
45:11 - off at the rate of 56 cents a mile so
45:14 - that's a really important one to take
45:16 - um
45:17 - if you're using your personal cell phone
45:20 - uh for your freelance business you can
45:22 - write off um a portion of that
45:24 - uh again you can write off the portion
45:27 - that is business related is the thing to
45:29 - understand here so let's say uh 40 of
45:32 - your personal cell phone use is related
45:35 - to your business
45:37 - you can write off 40 of that bill so in
45:40 - other words if your cell phone is cell
45:42 - phone bills 100 bucks a month you pay
45:44 - that personally because it's your
45:45 - personal phone but 40 of it is business
45:49 - related uh every month that's 40 a month
45:52 - you can
45:53 - write off as a business expense or 480 a
45:57 - year which would lower your taxable
45:59 - income by that much so when you're using
46:01 - personal things like your cell phone for
46:04 - partial work purposes make sure the
46:07 - portion of that that's work related is
46:09 - being deducted
46:10 - off your taxes
46:12 - equipment purchases fall into the same
46:15 - category as cell phones
46:17 - uh let's say you buy a new laptop and
46:20 - i'm gonna use some round simple numbers
46:22 - to prove the point let's say you pay two
46:24 - thousand dollars for it
46:26 - let's say
46:27 - 50 of that laptop is used for work of
46:30 - its time is used for work 50 of it is
46:32 - used for
46:33 - uh personal stuff you can write off a
46:36 - thousand dollars of that cost you may
46:38 - have to depreciate it but that's an
46:40 - issue for an account you'll be able to
46:41 - write off half the cost if half of it is
46:45 - used for work purposes so that's
46:47 - something to talk to your accountant
46:49 - about
46:50 - uh
46:51 - travel that is necessary and
46:53 - non-extravagant
46:55 - can be deducted okay
46:57 - so in other words um if you try if your
47:01 - travel if you are traveling
47:03 - like taking a trip it doesn't this can
47:05 - include airfare hotels meals
47:08 - things of that nature and the primary
47:10 - purpose of the trip
47:13 - is for work
47:15 - and it's not extravagant
47:17 - you can deduct the work related expenses
47:20 - with that so in other words
47:22 - let's say for example i live in ohio
47:26 - and let's say i've got a
47:28 - fly to montana to
47:30 - meet with a customer
47:32 - the primary purpose of me going is to
47:34 - meet with the customer it's not i'm not
47:37 - going to montana for a vacation and oh
47:39 - i'll meet with the customer while i'm
47:41 - there the purpose of the trip is to go
47:43 - to montana
47:44 - and
47:45 - meet uh meet with the customer i can
47:47 - deduct the airfare i can deduct the
47:49 - hotel
47:50 - um you know i can deduct my meals things
47:52 - of that nature now if i do things on
47:54 - that trip that are purely like personal
47:56 - entertainment that aspect of it won't be
47:58 - deductible but the necessary part of it
48:00 - for the business trip
48:02 - that can be uh deducted from my taxes
48:05 - now again it has to be non-extravagant
48:07 - so for example flying coach might be
48:10 - deductible
48:11 - flying first class might not you know
48:13 - think things of that sort so those are
48:15 - things to talk to your accountant about
48:17 - but if you are traveling for work and
48:19 - it's a necessary work trip that's
48:21 - something that is uh tax
48:23 - tax deductible so
48:26 - mileage and travel through an s corp
48:29 - deducting uh the business as the
48:32 - business portion of things like your
48:33 - cell phone bill deducting uh
48:36 - the business portion of equipment
48:38 - purchases of things like laptops things
48:40 - of that nature and necessary and
48:42 - non-extravagant travel are just four
48:45 - examples of deductions that people miss
48:47 - all the time make sure you're not
48:49 - missing those uh talk to your accountant
48:51 - about them and see what you can deduct
48:52 - those are ways to get your taxable
48:54 - income down quite a bit if you have
48:55 - those deductions and
48:57 - it always does surprise me the extent to
48:59 - which i see people who miss out on those
49:02 - deductions
49:04 - one of the biggest deductions that most
49:07 - people miss out on is the tax benefits
49:10 - that come from retirement savings
49:12 - and
49:14 - one of the big reasons people miss out
49:15 - on these deductions is because they
49:16 - don't save their retirement for their
49:17 - retirement that's an entirely different
49:19 - rant
49:20 - but the one thing to understand
49:22 - especially if you're a business owner
49:25 - is that there are provisions in the tax
49:27 - code
49:28 - that allow you
49:30 - to
49:31 - save for your retirement
49:33 - you can save a lot on your taxes by
49:35 - saving on your retirement
49:37 - or saving for your retirement
49:39 - which means that those tax benefits
49:42 - help pay for the contributions you make
49:45 - to retirement accounts okay
49:47 - um
49:48 - the first way to do this is through an
49:50 - ira which is an individual retirement
49:52 - account anybody can do that you don't
49:53 - have to be self-employed
49:55 - or the second way to do it is through
49:58 - what's called a simple
49:59 - um i'm going to look at the ira first
50:02 - and then we will take a look at the
50:03 - simple the simple is something you'll do
50:05 - if you own an s corporation or an llc
50:07 - being taxed as an s corporation and
50:09 - you've structured your freelance
50:10 - business that way so
50:12 - let's start by looking at another one of
50:14 - my less than attractive slides
50:18 - if you have an ira which is an
50:20 - individual retirement account
50:23 - and i really recommend a book that i'll
50:25 - talk about here in a second but let's
50:26 - say you have an individual retirement
50:28 - account
50:30 - for
50:31 - 2020 the 2021 tax year
50:34 - you could contribute six thousand
50:36 - dollars to your ira in other words you
50:38 - could put six thousand dollars into
50:41 - your personal uh individual retirement
50:44 - account
50:45 - that six thousand dollars is tax
50:47 - deductible meaning if you made a hundred
50:49 - thousand dollars during the year
50:52 - and then you
50:53 - uh
50:54 - you know uh
50:55 - made six thousand dollars worth of
50:57 - retirement contributions you would only
50:59 - pay taxes on ninety four thousand
51:00 - dollars
51:02 - okay
51:03 - so since your taxable income goes down
51:05 - the amount in taxes you paid goes down
51:08 - so what you see here is that if
51:10 - somebody's in the 22 tax bracket
51:13 - and they made
51:14 - six thousand dollars
51:16 - in ira contributions during 2021
51:20 - they will reduce their annual tax
51:22 - obligations by one thousand three
51:24 - hundred and twenty dollars
51:26 - meaning that when you subtract the tax
51:29 - savings
51:30 - from what they paid into the individual
51:32 - retirement account
51:34 - they wound up with four thousand six
51:36 - hundred and eighty dollars
51:38 - costs
51:39 - for
51:40 - six thousand dollars in
51:42 - uh retirement savings in other words
51:46 - they got six thousand dollars in a
51:48 - retirement account but after you factor
51:51 - in their tax savings it really only cost
51:52 - them four thousand six hundred and
51:54 - eighty dollars
51:55 - okay and if you keep doing that every
51:57 - year and that money keeps growing you
51:59 - really get a huge compounding effect on
52:01 - that and your tax savings are helping
52:04 - fund your retirement okay
52:08 - an even bigger version of this would be
52:10 - if you start what's called a simple
52:13 - and i'm putting up the slide for that
52:14 - now
52:16 - and what a simple is
52:18 - is
52:19 - it's
52:20 - kind of works it's an ira that works
52:22 - similarly to a 401k and you can do this
52:24 - if you're the owner of an s corporation
52:27 - so as we talked about earlier if you own
52:29 - an s corporation
52:31 - you own the company but you're also an
52:33 - employee of the company
52:35 - so what happens with a simple is
52:38 - the individual
52:40 - which is you the employee
52:42 - can contribute for twenty twenty one
52:44 - thirteen thousand dollars into the
52:46 - retirement plan
52:48 - the company which you own
52:50 - can match up to three percent
52:54 - of the dollar for dollar can match up to
52:57 - three percent of the employees savings
52:59 - so you are the employee you're
53:01 - contributing thirteen thousand dollars
53:03 - you own the company
53:05 - which is contributing eighteen hundred
53:06 - dollars
53:08 - the individual
53:10 - where i got eighteen hundred dollars
53:11 - from it like i said you can do three
53:13 - percent of
53:15 - the salary so i'm assuming a sixty
53:18 - thousand dollar salary here which is
53:19 - where i get the eighteen hundred dollars
53:21 - from
53:22 - so someone making paying themselves a
53:24 - salary
53:25 - of sixty thousand dollars before all
53:28 - their profit
53:30 - can contribute thirteen thousand dollars
53:31 - to the retirement plan
53:33 - which they will deduct from their taxes
53:37 - keep in mind they have to pay taxes on
53:39 - the company profits but the company
53:40 - profits are going to be reduced by
53:42 - eighteen hundred dollars
53:44 - so you're saving thirteen thousand
53:46 - dollars on the personal side and
53:47 - eighteen hundred dollars on the business
53:49 - side from your taxes
53:52 - if you're in the twenty two percent tax
53:54 - bracket
53:56 - that's fourteen thousand eight hundred
53:57 - dollars less
53:59 - that you're going to report an income
54:02 - at the 22 tax bracket that means you
54:05 - save
54:06 - three thousand one hundred seventy seven
54:08 - dollars in federal income tax
54:10 - so
54:11 - you contributed fourteen thousand eight
54:13 - hundred dollars to your retirement
54:15 - accounts
54:16 - but it really only cost you eleven
54:18 - thousand six hundred and twenty three
54:20 - dollars
54:21 - again you received retirement savings of
54:24 - fourteen thousand eight hundred dollars
54:27 - and when you factor in the tax savings
54:30 - it only cost you eleven thousand six
54:31 - hundred and twenty three dollars now
54:32 - imagine if you keep doing that year
54:34 - after year after year after year
54:36 - okay and again that is
54:38 - in contributions from the individual
54:40 - side where you are the employee and its
54:42 - contributions from the company side
54:44 - where you are the company owner and this
54:46 - assumes the salary of sixty thousand
54:47 - dollars a year that you're paying
54:48 - yourself before
54:50 - the profit that you would also pay taxes
54:52 - on
54:54 - so
54:55 - a simple if you have an llc that is
54:58 - taxed as an s corp but simple can be
55:01 - a very powerful way to save on taxes and
55:04 - be building wealth for yourself
55:06 - simultaneously okay and being aware of
55:08 - things like this is how you can really
55:10 - improve you know your standing
55:12 - financially
55:14 - so in terms of deductions understand
55:17 - that deductions
55:19 - are subtracted from your revenue or
55:21 - income to arrive at your taxable income
55:25 - okay
55:27 - on the business side of things you get
55:28 - your obvious ones like office rent
55:30 - things of that nature that are going to
55:31 - be deducted before you figure out what
55:33 - your profit slash business income is
55:35 - you have your less obvious ones like
55:38 - reimbursing your mileage through an s
55:39 - core person or business usage of your
55:41 - cell phone so on so forth
55:43 - those can be deducted from the business
55:46 - also if you do it correctly
55:49 - also understand that proper retirement
55:52 - savings can greatly and i do mean
55:53 - greatly
55:55 - save you money on taxes
55:57 - and these are all things what to be
55:59 - deducting uh retirement planning etc
56:02 - that you need to sit down and talk with
56:03 - an accountant for accounting about
56:06 - because you can really get into some
56:07 - complicated topics here but the thing to
56:09 - take from this video is go talk to an
56:10 - accountant and make sure you're
56:12 - capturing all these tax savings because
56:13 - it will really help you get ahead
56:15 - financially okay so deductions are very
56:18 - important and make sure you are getting
56:20 - all the deductions you possibly can and
56:22 - that's how you keep more of what you
56:24 - earn all right so
56:26 - now that we've had that discussion let's
56:28 - talk about how
56:29 - self-employed people will make their tax
56:31 - payments during the year
56:41 - okay let's talk and i do mean briefly
56:43 - about
56:44 - making your tax payments during the year
56:46 - as a freelance developer
56:48 - this is something where a lot of
56:50 - freelance workers and self-employed
56:52 - people get themselves in a lot of
56:53 - trouble because when you're an employee
56:56 - paying your taxes during the year is not
56:58 - something you have to worry about you
56:59 - get a paycheck your employer does your
57:01 - withholding for you and at the end of
57:03 - the year you've been paying into your
57:04 - taxes as the year has gone on right well
57:07 - when you're a self-employed person
57:09 - it's your responsibility to make sure
57:10 - those tax payments get remitted to the
57:13 - irs
57:14 - and if you fail to
57:16 - make them properly you're actually going
57:18 - to get hit penalty at the end of the
57:19 - year and unfortunately i have had the
57:23 - unfortunate pleasure of talking to many
57:25 - self-employed people over the years
57:27 - who didn't understand how to manage
57:29 - their tax payments during the year and
57:31 - now they have a multi-year debt to the
57:33 - irs that they may never get out of i've
57:36 - talked to multiple people in that this
57:37 - kind of sad situation so when you're
57:40 - working for yourself
57:41 - understand that you need to be making
57:43 - your tax payments during the year your
57:44 - employer is not doing it for you okay
57:48 - if you are running in uh if you're a
57:51 - 1099 worker
57:53 - running a sole proprietorship or uh
57:55 - running an llc without the s corp
57:57 - election you need to make quarterly
57:59 - payments um through form 1040es
58:03 - we're going to link to that in the
58:04 - description below and that's form 1040es
58:08 - and there's an instruction sheet
58:10 - attached to it showing how to calculate
58:12 - your quarterly payments um
58:14 - and you can also uh fill out a virtual
58:17 - form of 1040es by uh directly for the
58:20 - irs website we'll include a link to that
58:23 - below as well where you would go to make
58:25 - those
58:25 - what are called estimated tax payments
58:28 - um for a year
58:30 - the calculation of your estimated tax
58:32 - payments can get pretty complicated it's
58:34 - something you need to be talking to an
58:36 - accountant about the thing to understand
58:38 - is that
58:39 - if you don't pay in enough tax during
58:41 - the year at the end of the year you will
58:42 - get hit with a penalty okay that is
58:44 - something you really want to avoid so
58:47 - talk to an accountant if you're
58:48 - self-employed and make sure that you are
58:50 - paying uh an appropriate amount of taxes
58:53 - during the year
58:55 - if you are being taxed as an s
58:56 - corporation in other words you're an llc
58:59 - and you've chosen to be taxed as an s
59:00 - corporation which is what we do in our
59:02 - business
59:04 - as we've said throughout this video you
59:05 - own the business but you're also an
59:07 - employee of the business and you get a
59:08 - paycheck from the company so we have a
59:10 - payroll service that manages that for us
59:12 - in our business
59:14 - and federal taxes and various taxes get
59:17 - held out of that paycheck just like they
59:19 - would uh any other w-2 job
59:23 - the problem with that however is
59:25 - you have to pay yourself a reasonable
59:27 - salary for the s corp but then you have
59:28 - profits on top of that so i get my
59:31 - reasonable salary
59:33 - taxes are only withheld on that salary i
59:36 - s at the end of the year i still have to
59:38 - pay taxes
59:40 - on those profits meaning that i on top
59:43 - of the taxes that get held out of my
59:44 - paycheck i still make quarterly payments
59:46 - to
59:47 - the irs to cover the taxes that are
59:49 - going to be
59:50 - due on business profits
59:52 - so
59:54 - um we do it by making uh estimated
59:56 - payments every quarter some people do
59:59 - this by
60:01 - cover the taxes on their uh profits by
60:03 - having extra money held out of their
60:05 - paychecks either way is acceptable it's
60:07 - just important you talk with an
60:08 - accountant and have a tax plan in place
60:11 - so that you do not get hit with a big
60:14 - tax obligation at the end of the year
60:16 - you know you don't want to find out that
60:17 - you
60:18 - weigh underpaid during the year and not
60:20 - only do you owe the irs a really
60:22 - substantial amount of money in short
60:23 - order but now you've also been hit with
60:25 - a penalty on top of that that is
60:26 - something you want to avoid so discuss
60:29 - how much to be paying
60:30 - with an accountant and understand you do
60:32 - it either through form 1040 es
60:35 - or through the irs website
60:39 - one other thing i'll say on this note
60:41 - it's something to talk to your
60:42 - accountant about is i am not a fan of
60:46 - substantially overpaying taxes during
60:49 - the year um as we talked about earlier
60:52 - in this video there's a difference
60:53 - between what you pay in during the year
60:54 - and what your taxes are
60:56 - you pay in taxes during the year think
60:58 - of that as for example withholdings from
61:00 - a paycheck at the end of the year you
61:02 - fill out your 1040 form and it says what
61:04 - your tax due is
61:05 - what you paid in during the year from
61:07 - withholding or estimated tax payments is
61:10 - offset against your tax obligation if
61:13 - you paid in more than the obligation you
61:15 - get a refund if you paid in less than
61:16 - the obligation
61:18 - you have a balance due
61:20 - what this means is that if you are
61:22 - getting a big tax refund at the end of
61:24 - the year you way overpaid your taxes
61:27 - during the year which means for 12
61:28 - months you've been loaning money to the
61:29 - government interest-free okay in other
61:31 - words you've been giving the government
61:33 - more money than you needed to to pre-pay
61:35 - your taxes for the year
61:36 - they're holding that money at the end of
61:38 - the year they're going to give you back
61:39 - the balance with no interest on it
61:43 - as we've been talking about through this
61:44 - video managing your taxes is one of the
61:46 - important ways of getting ahead
61:48 - financially in this world and the last
61:51 - time i checked loaning p money to people
61:53 - interest free is not a good way to get
61:55 - ahead financially
61:57 - so anytime you come across somebody who
61:59 - gets excited about getting a big tax
62:01 - refund it's important to understand what
62:03 - that person is excited about is that
62:06 - they've loaned money to government
62:07 - interest free all year and now they're
62:08 - just getting the money back i mean to me
62:10 - that's not something to get excited
62:11 - about
62:12 - okay
62:13 - so
62:14 - talk to your accountant
62:16 - again i'm not offering this as personal
62:18 - financial advice but i'm just saying
62:20 - talk to your accountant
62:22 - make sure you're uh
62:24 - at least paying in
62:26 - enough to not get hit with penalty at
62:28 - the end of the year and be mindful of
62:30 - the fact that it may not necessarily be
62:32 - a good idea to
62:33 - loan money to
62:35 - the government interest free and when
62:38 - you talk to your accountant you'll come
62:39 - up with the best vehicle for making sure
62:40 - your taxes get paid during this year
62:42 - whether it's through
62:43 - withholding from
62:45 - your escort paycheck or whether it is
62:48 - from making quarterly payments through
62:49 - form 1040es
62:51 - which again is for estimated payments
62:54 - but the bottom line to take from this is
62:56 - that
62:57 - one of the things about being a
62:58 - freelancer is that you don't have the
63:00 - benefit of your employer just sending in
63:01 - your taxes for your every paycheck now
63:03 - it's something you need to be managing
63:05 - yourself
63:06 - so make sure you do it correctly and
63:08 - that's something to talk to an
63:09 - accountant about and again
63:10 - quarterly payments or paycheck
63:12 - withholding if
63:14 - you are uh an s corp owner okay
63:17 - so
63:18 - let's close out this video by talking
63:20 - about why where you live is so important
63:31 - okay you have made it to the end of this
63:33 - video and i know taxes aren't the most
63:36 - exciting topic in the world to talk
63:37 - about but they are really important to
63:40 - getting ahead financially
63:42 - on that note the whole point of this
63:44 - video has been about getting ahead
63:46 - financially and the importance of taxes
63:49 - in that endeavor okay
63:51 - where you live
63:53 - matters a whole lot for
63:56 - how much you pay in taxes you'll always
63:58 - hear people say they move somewhere else
63:59 - because of a cheaper cost of living like
64:02 - for example i live in ohio because it is
64:04 - way cheaper than living in a place like
64:07 - california but what a lot of people
64:09 - don't
64:09 - fact tend to factor in is
64:12 - what they might be paying in taxes if
64:14 - they live somewhere else before my wife
64:16 - and i moved to ohio we actually looked
64:17 - into moving to san francisco
64:19 - and it wasn't the high rent and
64:21 - everything that caused us to say we're
64:23 - not going to move there it was
64:25 - what i considered to be an outrageous
64:27 - tax structure in california in san
64:28 - francisco that kept us from
64:30 - moving there so
64:33 - in addition to cost of living your tax
64:35 - obligation will be
64:36 - greatly impacted and why is this well
64:39 - like as we talked about earlier in the
64:40 - video
64:42 - there are levels of taxation right you
64:44 - pay federal income tax you pay
64:46 - employment tax like uh social security
64:48 - medicare medicaid but you also pay state
64:49 - income tax and local income tax well
64:52 - those things differ depending on where
64:54 - you are in the united states
64:56 - some places have high state income tax
64:59 - some places have no state income tax and
65:01 - then some places fall in the middle
65:03 - where
65:04 - uh maybe there is a state income tax
65:06 - it's not too high it's not too low and
65:08 - maybe you pay it and
65:10 - maybe you don't and some places have
65:12 - local taxes and some don't
65:14 - so
65:15 - in california for example it's a state
65:17 - that's notorious for having a very high
65:19 - state income tax so if you live in
65:20 - california even after you've paid the
65:23 - federal government all your taxes that
65:25 - you have to pay to them you have to pay
65:26 - a big state income taxes state of
65:28 - california and you're probably going to
65:29 - pay a local income tax to whatever city
65:31 - you live in
65:33 - nevada
65:34 - is on the other end of that spectrum
65:36 - nevada has zero state income tax none if
65:39 - you live in nevada you do not pay state
65:41 - income tax they also don't have local
65:43 - income tax okay so you're not paying
65:46 - those taxes at all in nevada
65:49 - in ohio
65:50 - where i live
65:52 - there is state income tax
65:54 - but for the most part self-employed
65:56 - people don't have to pay it the state
65:57 - credits you back um quite a bit of
66:01 - uh anything you paid in if you're
66:03 - self-employed you have to make quite a
66:04 - bit of money to pay any state income tax
66:06 - if you are self-employed in the state of
66:09 - ohio so
66:11 - that's a so ohio is an example of a
66:13 - place where
66:15 - going the freelance route not only saves
66:17 - you money on your federal income taxes
66:20 - it saves you quite a bit of money on
66:22 - your state income taxes you know as well
66:25 - so
66:26 - when you're figuring out you know
66:29 - how to get ahead financially you know a
66:31 - lot of people do look at hey maybe
66:34 - moving to another place will help them
66:35 - because of lower cost of living you also
66:37 - need to think of tax consequences
66:40 - in there as well so
66:42 - again getting ahead financially if
66:44 - you're thinking of the tax system it's
66:46 - going to help you quite a bit
66:48 - and if you're living in a place that
66:50 - really provides advantages to
66:52 - self-employed people it makes going the
66:54 - freelance route
66:55 - even all that more you know attractive
66:58 - so the one thing i would hope that you
67:00 - really take from this video is that a
67:04 - proper tax planning can really help you
67:07 - get ahead
67:09 - a lot of people fail to consider the
67:11 - fact that their taxes if they're not
67:13 - their biggest expense or their second
67:14 - biggest expense and for most people they
67:17 - are the biggest expense okay you cannot
67:19 - get ahead financially unless you're
67:21 - getting your taxes under control it is
67:22 - just very very hard to do remember
67:25 - people who are well off tend to be well
67:27 - off in part because they
67:29 - think about their taxes
67:32 - i know this video as long as it was
67:34 - really only touched a lot of these
67:36 - topics on like a very
67:38 - surface kind of level it's because taxes
67:40 - can get very complicated so that is why
67:42 - it's really important that you discuss
67:44 - these things with a professional if you
67:46 - are
67:47 - going to freelance route the
67:49 - self-employment route and you are
67:51 - working hard at it and making good money
67:52 - at it
67:53 - it is well worth the cost of a good
67:55 - accountant to make sure you are saving
67:58 - on your taxes so i hope you found this
68:00 - video helpful um if there are any topics
68:02 - you'd like to see discussed in the
68:04 - future please drop them in the comments
