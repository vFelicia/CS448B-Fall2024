00:00 - Hi folks. My name is Alex Sharma.
00:02 - I'm a developer advocate at CircleCI and I am here today to talk to you about Continuous Integration.
00:09 - Which is a software development practice where everyone on the engineering team
00:14 - is continuously integrating these small code changes back into the codebase.
00:19 - After each change that they're making, there's a suite of tests that runs automatically
00:24 - that checks the code for any bugs or errors or anything like that.
00:29 - So what does that look like in practice? I've drawn this beautiful flow chart up here for you.
00:34 - Step one is you make a change.
00:36 - And this is something maybe on Github. You make a future branch, you push it up, submit a pull request.
00:41 - That's the change that I'm talking about here.
00:44 - Push that up, then you run your tests automatically, and that's that's pretty important
00:48 - The tests need to be run in a consistent way so that everyone on your team has full confidence that
00:54 - they're running the tests in the same way.
00:56 - You don't really have a guarantee that your machine is the same as your neighbor's machine.
01:01 - That's really hard to to lock down. So those tests are running automatically somewhere else.
01:07 - If they pass, you're good to go and you can just keep making changes.
01:13 - You go right back around, submit another pull request. Go wild.
01:18 - If the tests fail, you need to make sure. It's your responsibility to fix the code.
01:22 - Fix the code until your tests pass and then you can continue developing.
01:27 - So it's this wonderful cycle. The idea being that you want to catch these bugs as soon as you can.
01:33 - So they're not lingering over a long period of time.
01:37 - So that's what Continuous Integration is and next time, we'll talk about why you would be doing this.
01:42 - We'll dig into that. Thanks!
