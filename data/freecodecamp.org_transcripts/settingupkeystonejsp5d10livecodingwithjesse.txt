00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with jesse this is jesse and today we're
00:12 - going to test out keystone js i've never
00:16 - used keystone
00:18 - so
00:19 - i don't know if it's going to work i
00:21 - don't know how this is going to go
00:24 - this is for our
00:26 - our big project project 5 which would be
00:29 - the main website for the university that
00:31 - i work at
00:33 - we've already
00:35 - pulled some data and put it into
00:38 - a wordpress database so my sequel
00:42 - and that works and we might end up going
00:45 - with that but i thought it would be
00:47 - worth it to test out
00:48 - a javascript based content management
00:51 - system so that we could be full stack
00:53 - javascript
00:54 - uh so that's we're gonna do today
00:58 - i um i can see in the live chat here uh
01:01 - harshit is worried about
01:03 - graphql in it
01:05 - and i was a little bit too so i found
01:09 - uh on github that somebody had already
01:11 - set up
01:13 - next.js which is what we've been using
01:16 - with graphql and keystone all together
01:20 - now i don't know that i would like you
01:22 - know everything about the way they did
01:24 - it but for today i think it's worth it
01:27 - just to
01:28 - use what they've done to get us started
01:31 - just to see if we like it no sense in
01:34 - trying to customize everything
01:36 - early on if you know we're not even sure
01:39 - if we're going to use it
01:40 - if anybody knows of an open source
01:43 - headless
01:45 - javascript cms
01:48 - that we could use
01:50 - i'm still open to that because keystone
01:53 - is not maintained as far as i know
01:56 - uh let me pull over
01:58 - on my screen
02:03 - some
02:06 - some info about uh keystone so i'm gonna
02:09 - switch
02:11 - views here
02:13 - okay
02:16 - so
02:17 - let's check this out
02:20 - um
02:22 - okay so something was changed a month
02:25 - ago
02:33 - so
02:34 - yeah it's not i mean some of these are
02:36 - two years ago
02:38 - yeah
02:39 - the la the latest uh release
02:44 - came out in may of 2016.
02:53 - so
02:55 - you can see there's been some other
02:57 - stuff going on but it's really like
03:02 - i don't i don't know how i feel about
03:04 - using something that that seems to be
03:07 - not
03:08 - actively maintained anymore there's some
03:11 - activity but
03:14 - i'm just not
03:17 - i don't know we'll look at it we'll take
03:19 - a look at it and we'll see
03:21 - um we'll see how it goes
03:24 - so this is what i thought i'd use now
03:26 - obviously this is not a popular
03:28 - repository right we've got eight stars
03:30 - two forks um
03:34 - but what this does do is it uses
03:38 - you know the three things that we're
03:40 - already planning on using
03:42 - uh now
03:43 - to be
03:44 - to be honest i don't care quite as much
03:47 - about them using next because that's all
03:50 - going to be decoupled
03:55 - but
03:56 - it does have this
03:58 - which is what i what i really care about
04:01 - um graphql with keystone
04:04 - so let's try it out
04:07 - um we do need
04:09 - i do need to make sure that i have the
04:11 - latest version of which i don't
04:14 - remember if i do or not
04:16 - so let's
04:18 - try this out
04:27 - i'm pretty sure i have done this
04:29 - recently
04:34 - i'm i'm probably don't have um the
04:37 - latest version though
04:46 - hmm
05:01 - oh cool i should say and i can just
05:03 - homebrew
05:05 - um homebrew is
05:08 - uh like a project
05:10 - um
05:12 - it's like a package manager for your mac
05:16 - all right so let's try this out
05:21 - uh hey i see some stuff in the live chat
05:23 - andre asked if i'm canadian uh no i am
05:26 - not canadian
05:28 - so
05:29 - nothing wrong with being canadian but
05:31 - um i was born in west virginia here in
05:35 - the united states
05:44 - okay
05:49 - what's the uh
05:52 - what's the package for
06:29 - okay i found it
06:31 - um
06:38 - i think i've run a brew update recently
06:40 - but
06:42 - no reason not to run it again
07:07 - seems to be taking a while
07:10 - all right i'll let that go
07:12 - all right cool
07:14 - i went through all right so uh if you're
07:17 - just joining uh we're getting the
07:19 - prerequisites ready to install keystone
07:22 - uh so
07:25 - all right cool i was just installing
07:30 - and it looks like i i did already
07:32 - install this
07:33 - so i just need to upgrade
07:45 - all right so
07:51 - i'll let that go uh now
08:07 - let's clone this i mean it looks like i
08:09 - have everything else i need
08:17 - all right we're going to clone this and
08:18 - again i'm just doing this to get up and
08:20 - running as fast as i possibly can
08:23 - with graphql and keystone
08:32 - basically i just want to see how easy is
08:35 - it to add new post types
08:38 - and
08:39 - to navigate the um the editor and the
08:41 - cms
08:43 - i know there's already a demo online but
08:45 - i can't get in there and
08:47 - you know see the code and change it
08:50 - um
08:51 - like i'd like i want to
08:54 - the question hassam says what is
08:56 - collaboration on github
08:59 - um
09:02 - i
09:03 - is there something on github called
09:05 - collaboration
09:10 - i don't know
09:15 - i'm not sure who some uh does anyone
09:18 - else know
09:20 - um having answered the question what is
09:22 - collaboration on github
09:24 - unless you mean collaboration in general
09:26 - um
09:28 - i'm not sure uh if you could clarify for
09:30 - me um maybe i could give you a better
09:32 - answer
09:35 - all right still not quite done with
09:37 - homebrew
09:39 - installing
10:06 - all right great
10:07 - so we have there now let's
10:10 - do a git clone
10:13 - and
10:14 - i'll add this
10:23 - should i fork this first
10:27 - yeah let me let me fork it first
10:31 - and
10:33 - then i'll have
10:35 - a repo i can make changes and i don't
10:37 - know how long we'll be testing this out
10:39 - it would probably be better
10:41 - um so
10:44 - let's find this and fork it
10:48 - into
10:52 - here
11:03 - well that was fast awesome
11:05 - okay now let's let's clean this one
11:22 - um
11:27 - john b said i should spork it sporkit
11:29 - will let you fork the repo but also
11:31 - spoon it when you're feeling lonely
11:36 - oh what is my pass race uh
11:42 - joby i'm gonna remember that one and use
11:45 - it at some point in the future if you
11:47 - don't mind
11:53 - let's see i need to find my
11:56 - ssh
11:58 - passphrase
12:00 - and
12:00 - lastpass
12:12 - and
12:28 - all right and i think we've done this
12:30 - before but
12:32 - if you get asked for your ssh passphrase
12:34 - and you don't feel like typing it in
12:36 - again if you just do ssh add
12:39 - and hit enter uh it'll ask you for it
12:41 - again and then if you put it in then it
12:43 - it won't ask you again
12:46 - uh at least until
12:49 - until you restart your computer i think
12:51 - if you restart your computer then it'll
12:53 - ask you again but at least for that
12:54 - session you'll be um
12:56 - you'll be fine
12:59 - i'll get harsh it says brew services
13:01 - start mongodb
13:03 - aha do i just need to run it like that
13:06 - like later on when we need to use it or
13:08 - do i need to do that now
13:17 - all right so we have this we have a
13:20 - clone let's go what is that called
13:25 - keystone there we go
13:28 - let's run yarn
13:32 - get all this stuff installed
13:34 - okay harsha says i need to run that
13:36 - command now brew services start mongodb
13:40 - so i'm going to copy that
13:45 - and when this is finished uh we'll run
13:47 - that as well
13:48 - thank you harshit
13:52 - oh cool blake said the ssh ad worked uh
13:56 - so
13:57 - awesome i'm glad glad it worked it is
13:59 - useful to you
14:03 - oh also
14:04 - i have a meeting at three so
14:08 - this is gonna be a short stream
14:10 - i really hope i don't forget about my
14:12 - meeting at three
14:14 - i'm sure that someone
14:17 - one of my bosses will come in and knock
14:19 - on my door if i do forget and they won't
14:21 - be happy
14:23 - um
14:26 - all right
14:28 - i wanted to start the stream earlier but
14:30 - i was updating my computer to the latest
14:34 - um
14:35 - mac
14:36 - version so it is at high sierra and it
14:39 - took way longer than i thought it would
14:42 - take
14:43 - uh so and then when i finally got it
14:45 - restarted things were so slow at first
14:48 - so
14:50 - i did not get the streams scheduled
14:52 - earlier like i wanted to
14:56 - if you anyway
14:59 - some air is coming up
15:01 - i hope this isn't
15:05 - this isn't going to ruin
15:07 - the install
15:15 - let's see
15:17 - huh
15:20 - well that's no good
15:26 - hmm
15:37 - all right harsh it's saying that that
15:39 - fork is old
15:41 - oh man
15:43 - i hope it's not too old
15:54 - okay so harsh it's saying maybe it's
15:56 - trying to install things that don't even
15:58 - exist anymore
16:00 - well that may have just ruined my plan
16:02 - here
16:04 - and
16:05 - all right
16:12 - shoot
16:14 - um
16:15 - all right i this isn't the only keystone
16:18 - graphql repository that i found so let
16:21 - me just find the other ones that i had
16:23 - open
16:26 - and we can check out another one
16:30 - i mean i really don't know which one is
16:32 - better
16:33 - so
16:35 - i just happened to pick this one
16:37 - so i needed something
16:40 - all right
16:41 - oh roger said
16:43 - been running linux for years and never
16:44 - heard of ssh ad thanks oh you're welcome
16:47 - cool well if i can't get anything else
16:50 - to work at least i i was able to share
16:52 - that that little helpful bit uh with you
16:56 - all
16:57 - trying to get
16:59 - so i'm trying to adjust the screen i
17:01 - think i kept going
17:05 - i keep going off screen
17:08 - i can't tell which way all right that's
17:11 - that seems like it'll work
17:14 - all right
17:20 - uh
17:21 - all right
17:22 - let me
17:25 - i can't find the window
17:28 - let's see
17:29 - where is it at where
17:34 - all right maybe i closed it
17:45 - and i i i really wanted to have this
17:48 - ready to go so we could just you know go
17:50 - quickly since i don't have a lot of time
17:52 - but
17:53 - uh it looks like
17:56 - may not happen keystone graphql
18:08 - okay it looks like keystone
18:11 - js uh the organization keystone.js
18:14 - on github
18:15 - actually has graphql helpers there but
18:19 - it looks like everything's two years old
18:23 - not sure how helpful that's going to be
18:33 - hmm
19:03 - all right
19:05 - well let's um
19:14 - all right let's just go with something
19:16 - else
19:17 - oops
19:31 - all right oh there's some things in the
19:33 - live chat let's see what's what's going
19:34 - on here
19:35 - um
19:37 - my
19:38 - freelance project first prototype can
19:40 - you give me any suggestions the
19:42 - freelance project is using next a custom
19:45 - graphql server an apollo client and
19:47 - server-side rendering
19:48 - um
19:50 - yeah a hardship
19:51 - sure i'd i'd be happy to give you uh
19:53 - suggestions on that so just let me know
19:56 - uh
19:56 - where that's at if i mean i'm assuming
19:58 - you have a repo for it uh so just you
20:01 - know send me that link
20:03 - you know on twitter or whatever and i'll
20:05 - try to i probably can't take a look at
20:07 - it today because i'll have a meeting and
20:08 - i have to leave right after that
20:10 - but
20:12 - at some point this week i i can
20:13 - definitely take a look at it
20:20 - all right harsh it's saying let's let's
20:21 - use word wordpress
20:24 - roger says every time someone publishes
20:26 - a php website a kitten dies
20:28 - wouldn't we wouldn't want to kill
20:30 - kittens right
20:34 - just said it is truth yeah
20:36 - um
20:42 - yeah harsh i'm
20:45 - the more i
20:46 - um the more i try to look into these
20:49 - different javascript alternatives to
20:51 - wordpress the more i keep thinking we're
20:53 - just gonna need to go with wordpress
20:55 - like it's just
20:58 - all right listen everybody who's
21:00 - interested in a side project
21:03 - i think there's really
21:06 - a need
21:07 - for
21:08 - a javascript cms
21:12 - that is open source
21:14 - basically the javascript version of
21:17 - wordpress right
21:19 - so if anybody really wants a side
21:21 - project that could potentially be
21:22 - adopted by a lot of people
21:24 - make javascript wordpress
21:30 - certainly don't have the time to do it
21:31 - but i'd be happy to help
21:34 - um
21:36 - so
21:39 - all right
21:40 - i don't think we have time to do it
21:42 - before this project is due
21:44 - but
21:45 - potentially
21:47 - we could work on it longer term and then
21:50 - try to switch over to it at some point
21:52 - with this project
21:55 - all right so enough enough of me talking
21:57 - um
22:02 - let's see
22:04 - okay just let's make this together
22:07 - hey hey uh steven and um
22:11 - jewel it's j-u-l-e i'm assuming that's
22:13 - pronounced jewel if it's not please let
22:16 - me know and i will do my best to
22:18 - pronounce it correctly
22:23 - horses let's make this together using
22:25 - graphql
22:27 - suggest the name portions you just
22:29 - mentioned here in the chat
22:36 - strappy cms i have never
22:40 - heard
22:41 - of strappy cms
22:44 - let them eat cake php and have it too
22:49 - um
22:54 - and check out strappy
23:00 - bla all right blake says go to
23:01 - keystone.com
23:03 - getting started that's where that was
23:05 - actually just where i was about to go
23:06 - the only reason i didn't want to do it
23:07 - before is that they're
23:09 - they're getting started guys as you use
23:11 - a yeoman uh generator
23:14 - which i haven't used yeoman for a long
23:16 - time i don't even know if i have it
23:18 - installed on this machine i'm not
23:20 - opposed to using it just to get things
23:22 - up and running it would probably be
23:23 - pretty fast but
23:25 - um
23:27 - i i don't know uh we could i'm checking
23:30 - out strappy right now
23:32 - on my other screen
23:37 - um
23:51 - all right i'm checking out their github
23:52 - repo
23:54 - they are definitely way more up to date
23:56 - they have things that have been updated
23:59 - just a few hours ago
24:02 - it looks like let's see
24:05 - yeah it's all javascript
24:13 - it has a lot more stars here api cash
24:30 - well you can
24:31 - work with whatever database you want
24:33 - which that's awesome
24:39 - okay
24:40 - i'm i'm definitely gonna look into um
24:44 - strappy more
24:51 - all right we're probably going to do a
24:53 - stream tomorrow on strappy
24:55 - today let's just use this yeoman
24:57 - generator install this thing just to see
24:59 - how it goes right because
25:02 - i named the stream
25:04 - i said in the name of the uh the stream
25:07 - that
25:08 - we're gonna use uh keystone i even put
25:10 - their logo
25:12 - in the thumbnail for the video so let's
25:14 - at least install it and mess around with
25:17 - it
25:17 - uh just a bit
25:20 - after
25:22 - after this whole
25:26 - mess here with getting errors trying to
25:28 - use
25:29 - this i i'm not confident but
25:32 - uh where's my
25:34 - i know i had the getting started
25:37 - here we go
25:40 - or am i here getting started
25:45 - yeoman
25:45 - [Music]
25:48 - yo keystone do i have you i don't think
25:50 - i have yo installed anymore
25:59 - hey i do have yeoman installed awesome
26:02 - get me out of here
26:04 - okay
26:05 - yo
26:07 - keystone
26:22 - and they're not the generator yeoman
26:25 - keys oh i need to install it don't i
26:36 - there was another getting started there
26:38 - we go this one is like the super easy
26:40 - version of the getting started there we
26:42 - go
26:43 - install
26:45 - generator
26:46 - keystone there we go i it's been years
26:49 - since i've used keystone i didn't
26:52 - or since i've used yeoman uh i did not
26:55 - even remember that she had to install
26:57 - the generator first
26:59 - yeoman used to be amazing like back in
27:01 - the day i remember being so excited
27:04 - about it but and then it's just
27:08 - like nobody used it
27:10 - i said
27:12 - no
27:15 - can i just say no
27:17 - whatever
27:18 - um definitely says
27:21 - if i'm gonna use one
27:24 - why not
27:26 - sure
27:27 - let's let's get everything
27:31 - user's good enter an email address
27:39 - temporary password
27:41 - receiving plain text and changes
27:48 - what
27:50 - what is going on
28:02 - i don't know what password i just gave
28:03 - that
28:06 - yes new director chemo configuration
28:09 - sure
28:12 - um
28:22 - i don't want any of this stuff
28:26 - yes
28:29 - that was a lot more questions than i
28:30 - thought
28:34 - all right let me see
28:36 - i'm going to catch up with the live chat
28:37 - while that's installing
28:40 - that's correct
28:53 - now rook said
28:55 - i know nothing about it i remembered the
28:58 - name uh don't kill me if it turns out
29:00 - bad nah so far it looks really good so
29:03 - that's awesome thanks for that
29:05 - oh okay it was already mentioned by shaw
29:09 - at lib high
29:11 - oh i must have just missed it when it
29:13 - was mentioned before
29:16 - so sorry that i missed that
29:20 - and then endurojs.com
29:32 - okay so
29:34 - blake
29:36 - says there's an enduro
29:38 - js.com
29:40 - which
29:42 - has a has a nice full screen video hero
29:46 - section check that out
29:50 - nice
29:54 - all right let's check this out that
29:56 - myself documentation
30:17 - cool
30:19 - actually says themes in it this is like
30:21 - a wow
30:26 - this actually does look like javascript
30:28 - wordpress
30:35 - actually if if we wanted to make a front
30:37 - end too coupled with this i would
30:39 - probably go with this
30:42 - i think um
30:44 - what was the other one strappy
30:48 - strappy looks better just from like the
30:50 - five seconds that i looked at it and a
30:52 - little bit of time i looked at this i'll
30:55 - i'm gonna really check out strappy for
30:57 - this project
30:58 - but if i were to do another project
31:01 - where i wasn't trying to have a headless
31:03 - cms
31:05 - this one looks really nice
31:10 - not bad
31:11 - um
31:18 - okay ours is saying ghost is the most
31:21 - popular cms for javascript
31:30 - i've heard about ghosts before but i've
31:32 - never used it
31:40 - oh okay so ghost is like a uh
31:43 - subscription
31:45 - based
31:46 - service right
31:52 - wow finally
32:12 - wow
32:15 - all right let's check it out
32:20 - okay so uh we act we have a keystone
32:25 - keystone site going
32:28 - all right so this is not the latest
32:31 - version
32:32 - so the uh the beta i think is like the
32:34 - 4.0 beta of keystone was supposed to be
32:37 - built with react
32:40 - uh at least for the admin panel i think
32:43 - and
32:44 - this is not this is not react this is uh
32:47 - jquery and bootstrap
32:50 - so
32:54 - let's check it out i think if we type in
32:59 - keystone
33:00 - that's how we get to the back end
33:02 - yep
33:04 - all right so
33:12 - um
33:19 - i don't know what my password was
33:23 - i was supposed to get an email about it
33:24 - so let's let me check my email here
33:32 - maybe i didn't
33:34 - i thought i was going to but it's
33:36 - possible that i um
33:42 - that i didn't
33:43 - let's see
33:48 - okay cool harshit says you can actually
33:51 - host ghost yourself
33:52 - that's that's cool
33:54 - oh cool john b no the password is admin
33:59 - awesome
34:01 - thanks john b
34:04 - i tried to change the password but it
34:06 - didn't work so
34:07 - i guess it ended up being admin
34:12 - i was just gonna make it one two three
34:14 - four
34:15 - because
34:17 - all right that seems like a good
34:18 - password
34:20 - no one would ever guess that
34:23 - create a new post
34:27 - it's actually really fast i mean it's
34:29 - running locally so it should be fast
34:33 - so i guess it's not a good test
34:56 - yeah i mean this i really wish
34:58 - is this the beta
35:01 - that says it's the beta
35:04 - oh okay
35:06 - you know what this this is the latest
35:08 - version because it the back end is
35:10 - running in react they're still using
35:12 - jquery which is weird
35:14 - but um
35:17 - hey i mean we
35:18 - i wrote a site with jquery and react so
35:20 - i shouldn't didn't say anything actually
35:22 - i built two sites like that
35:24 - um
35:27 - yeah before when i checked that wasn't
35:29 - the admin area so
35:32 - i was mistaken
35:41 - all right well
35:45 - i tell you what here's my take on
35:48 - keystone
35:51 - if if you
35:53 - are looking for something to run a small
35:55 - site that's like probably not for a
35:57 - client and
35:59 - you're you know you're not that worried
36:01 - about it it's not there's not a lot on
36:02 - the line like it's on e-commerce site or
36:04 - something like that
36:05 - i think keystone's
36:07 - pretty cool it's nice especially if like
36:10 - if
36:11 - you want to use it headless i mean i
36:13 - don't know if i would want to use the
36:15 - the full cms uh with
36:18 - with the front end coupled to it
36:21 - uh but
36:23 - i guess you could
36:25 - uh so if you don't mind that it's
36:27 - probably not going to get updated often
36:29 - and i don't know if there's any support
36:32 - with it
36:33 - but
36:35 - the back end seems super easy to use and
36:39 - to customize it it's all javascript so i
36:41 - think this is actually kind of a cool
36:43 - thing if you want to take this almost as
36:45 - a boilerplate customize it on your own
36:47 - there's little chance that an update
36:49 - will come out and mess up what you've
36:51 - done right
36:52 - so so i think that would be cool to just
36:55 - fork it and customize it do what you
36:58 - want with it
36:59 - i mean i assume it's mit license i guess
37:02 - we could check
37:05 - yeah it's mit so you could do you know
37:07 - you do whatever you want with it i mean
37:08 - who knows maybe there are forks out
37:10 - there that that are being updated that
37:12 - are awesome
37:14 - but
37:15 - i don't think it's the right thing for
37:17 - our project
37:18 - i really kind of hoped it was
37:20 - especially since there were already some
37:22 - built-in
37:23 - graphql things out there that people
37:25 - were doing
37:28 - uh but ultimately
37:31 - i would say
37:33 - probably the main reason that i don't
37:36 - think we're going to use it now is just
37:38 - the lack of updates you know as i said
37:43 - you know there were some updates a month
37:45 - ago
37:46 - you know but it's
37:49 - likely not
37:50 - you know it's it's not maintained
37:53 - like i said the first actual release
37:56 - you know the major release was was over
37:59 - a year ago about a year and a half ago
38:02 - and although there are some newer things
38:04 - here in the beta
38:07 - you know even the newest thing was
38:09 - october 23rd and then before that was
38:11 - all the way back in january 25th
38:14 - so
38:16 - that that bothers me a little bit you
38:18 - know this isn't
38:20 - you know this isn't just a side project
38:22 - website this is the main website for the
38:24 - university
38:25 - this is by far the most important
38:27 - project that i've worked on since i've
38:29 - started here so
38:31 - i don't know if if you all disagree on
38:34 - on that assessment of keystone
38:37 - for this project please let me know in
38:39 - the live chat or in the comments or even
38:42 - you know twitter direct message whatever
38:44 - you want
38:47 - so
38:50 - i think it was worth it to check it out
38:52 - so we're a little bit more familiar with
38:54 - it
38:55 - i was kind of impressed at how easy it
38:58 - was to start if you use that yeoman
39:00 - generator i mean that was really really
39:03 - fast
39:04 - and and we have it all up and running
39:07 - you know i mean potentially
39:11 - you know you could throw in some posts
39:12 - here publish this thing and
39:16 - you know you you have a website with
39:18 - that you can have users with admin panel
39:21 - all that
39:23 - you know you have it up and running in
39:25 - you know less than an hour
39:27 - depending on how much content you want
39:29 - to put on it first so i mean that's
39:30 - impressive that's really impressive so
39:33 - this is one of the things like i really
39:34 - wish that this had been maintained more
39:38 - because i think it's
39:41 - you know
39:42 - this this is still pretty cool even
39:44 - though it's it hasn't been updated in a
39:46 - while
39:50 - yeah
39:51 - so i think if
39:53 - if this gets maintained or updated or
39:55 - somebody takes over on a fork
39:57 - this could be really cool
40:00 - but
40:01 - anyway
40:02 - i'm probably not gonna go with this
40:05 - and now it's a great time for me to stop
40:07 - go to the live chat answer some
40:08 - questions uh because i'll have i have a
40:11 - meeting in less than 20 minutes
40:14 - anyway so this stream maybe turned out
40:16 - not exactly what i how i thought it
40:18 - would
40:20 - but
40:21 - we still got to try out keystone
40:26 - uh so if anybody's interested in it
40:29 - at least you know how to
40:31 - at least the easiest way that i've found
40:33 - to install it
40:36 - and that is the recommended way with
40:38 - yeoman all right so let me go to the
40:41 - chat now
40:43 - and
40:45 - i'll answer any questions that you have
40:47 - so you have questions put it in there uh
40:49 - if we end up going too close to my
40:51 - meeting i will have to stop so there's a
40:53 - possibility i might not get to all the
40:54 - questions but i will do my best to
40:56 - answer everything
41:00 - let's see
41:05 - so i'm going to scroll up a bit because
41:06 - i think i did miss some things
41:23 - okay blake asked earlier about what i
41:25 - mean by headless cms
41:28 - and uh horseshoe gave an answer but i i
41:30 - just want to
41:32 - kind of answer on the
41:33 - video in case you're watching later i
41:35 - think that's that's probably a common
41:37 - question i apologize for just using that
41:38 - term without explaining it
41:40 - uh so a content management system like
41:44 - something like wordpress if you're
41:45 - familiar with that
41:48 - normally at least it has been the case
41:51 - with a lot of content management systems
41:53 - that
41:54 - the front end what the users see
41:57 - right the client facing portion of it
42:00 - is
42:01 - tied closely to the cms so for instance
42:04 - in wordpress you install wordpress and
42:07 - it comes with these themes
42:09 - right so you can change the themes right
42:12 - there from the cms and the theme is all
42:14 - the html and css and everything that
42:17 - it users are going to see
42:19 - when you go with a headless cms
42:22 - your website that the users see
42:24 - interacts with the content management
42:26 - system through an api
42:28 - so they're not tied together uh and in
42:32 - our case what will happen is the
42:36 - this the client
42:38 - the stuff that the client sees
42:40 - that site which we're building react
42:42 - will be hosted on an entirely different
42:44 - server than our content management
42:46 - system
42:49 - so there'll be no part of that content
42:51 - management system that controls
42:53 - you know kind of the look of the site so
42:55 - that's what we mean by headless and you
42:57 - can run normal cms's as headless cmss
43:01 - which which is what we've done with
43:03 - wordpress several times now and what we
43:05 - may end up doing again for this project
43:09 - so anyway thanks for asking that blake
43:11 - so if anybody if i ever use some terms
43:13 - that you're not familiar with feel free
43:15 - to ask don't worry if you know you think
43:18 - you might look like a newbie or whatever
43:20 - but
43:22 - it doesn't matter i would rather much
43:24 - rather you ask right off the bat then
43:26 - have to go through the whole stream
43:28 - not understanding what i'm saying
43:30 - and if you don't know what the term is i
43:32 - bet you there's other people watching
43:34 - that also don't know what the term is
43:36 - and there'll be people watching later on
43:38 - the recordings that don't know so
43:40 - uh so please um ask
43:45 - let's see
43:47 - okay cool harshit i um
43:50 - i got the link here to that you put in
43:53 - here which is to your blog
43:57 - so
43:58 - i'm gonna check that out
44:00 - i'll put that in my browser right now
44:02 - i'll check that out when i can later on
44:05 - nice very nice i just glanced at what
44:08 - what popped up immediately and and
44:10 - that's looking really good harsh it
44:16 - okay
44:21 - okay harshit was mentioning using ghost
44:23 - for his blog
44:24 - and uh
44:26 - says ghost uses markdown in the editor
44:29 - that's actually really cool if you're
44:30 - familiar with markdown
44:32 - that would be really cool if you're not
44:33 - familiar with markdown that might it
44:35 - might be a little bit difficult
44:38 - but i found it pretty easy to pick up on
44:40 - i'm no expert at markdown but
44:42 - uh it it's kind of nice
44:48 - all right steven says
44:51 - jesse just a shout out to you running
44:53 - these streams great job really shows how
44:55 - a programmer works makes me feel better
44:57 - about looking stuff up online all the
44:59 - time
45:00 - awesome
45:01 - that's hey that's what i wanted from
45:03 - these streams right i want everybody to
45:05 - see how much i mess up on the job and
45:08 - and how much i have to learn and work
45:09 - through things so i'm glad that uh that
45:12 - that's helping you feel better about
45:14 - that
45:15 - uh but that's
45:17 - i mean that's what we do right we we
45:18 - always are constantly learning uh as we
45:21 - go
45:26 - okay and stefan asked the same question
45:28 - about the headless cms so
45:30 - um so great see i knew there was more
45:33 - than one person that would ask that
45:37 - let's see
45:45 - rook says that back end looks like
45:46 - bootstrap yeah bootstrap uh was used for
45:49 - this
45:50 - for keystone
45:59 - okay
46:04 - man who says my first uh oss suggestion
46:07 - ever being used by jesse keystone yes
46:09 - suggestion yes thank you manu um like i
46:13 - said
46:14 - there are definitely parts of keystone
46:16 - that i'm really impressed with
46:19 - um
46:20 - yeah definitely just i'm just kind of
46:23 - hesitant about that
46:25 - about it not being actively maintained
46:27 - now or at least that's the appearance
46:29 - that i that i have if anybody that works
46:31 - on keystone is watching or ever watches
46:33 - this
46:34 - um
46:35 - please set me straight if i'm wrong
46:37 - about that or if anybody
46:39 - knows anyone ever hears about a fork of
46:42 - keystone that is being actively
46:44 - maintained
46:46 - i'd love to see that as well
46:48 - you know unless i hear about it
46:50 - this week it's probably not going to be
46:52 - what we use for this site
46:54 - because we got to move on but
46:58 - i'd still like to check it out and maybe
47:00 - even use it you know one of our projects
47:02 - later on if i can
47:05 - let's see
47:08 - oh philip says how about apostrophe cms
47:14 - i i'll have to check that out i've heard
47:16 - of that one as well also check that out
47:19 - um i'm getting a lot of suggestions i'll
47:21 - definitely have to do my research
47:22 - tomorrow morning
47:24 - and um and then we'll try out one of
47:26 - these other javascript cms's on the
47:29 - stream tomorrow
47:38 - okay phillip says uh
47:42 - says my friend is using strappy so
47:46 - phillip yeah i'd love to hear how
47:49 - strappy's going so if you happen to talk
47:51 - to your friend at some point soon
47:53 - um you know ask about
47:55 - what they think about strappy
47:58 - uh because i'd love to hear from
47:59 - somebody who's actually using it
48:03 - all right uh homeroom says
48:07 - i have a request will you take the chat
48:09 - screen to your screen when you answer
48:11 - questions in chat i want to see the chat
48:13 - while i watch the video later thank you
48:15 - uh on room that's actually a good idea
48:18 - and i did do that once unfortunately
48:20 - when i did that somebody typed in some
48:23 - things that weren't very nice
48:25 - uh and kind of it ruined it so um
48:30 - i'm not i'm not going to do that i i
48:32 - really wish i could do that but
48:34 - especially since i'm streaming
48:36 - uh while i'm at work for the university
48:38 - i just
48:40 - uh and it's on behalf of free code camp
48:43 - i'd really rather not have something
48:45 - crazy come up in the chat um
48:50 - i mean maybe i could go through later on
48:52 - and like blur it out but anybody that
48:55 - watched it live and watches it you know
48:57 - until i get a chance to go blurred out
48:59 - would see those things
49:00 - so i don't want to get the pre-code camp
49:03 - or my university in trouble with
49:04 - anything so
49:06 - that's why i'm not going to do it uh if
49:09 - if i can think up or if any you can
49:10 - think up some way that we could i don't
49:12 - know protect against that then i'm open
49:15 - to it but until then uh i'll just do my
49:18 - best to kind of read out what's in the
49:20 - chat so anyway that's a really good
49:22 - suggestion i said unfortunately somebody
49:25 - somebody ruined that
49:27 - uh
49:29 - so i just you know i don't want to
49:30 - expose you all and you know everybody
49:32 - else watching to um any type of you know
49:35 - craziness right
49:40 - uh
49:41 - ahadimi says exactly what i was about to
49:44 - ask what key features made you choose
49:46 - keystone
49:48 - um
49:50 - yeah so
49:52 - basically
49:53 - i think i'm not going to choose keystone
49:55 - officially but what led me to it at
49:58 - least to want to try it
50:00 - uh was i saw that there were other
50:02 - people that were using keystone with
50:04 - graphql and we definitely want to use
50:06 - graphql
50:08 - i saw that it was completely javascript
50:10 - based which i really liked that it was
50:12 - all javascript uh that way we can be
50:14 - full stack javascript and not have to
50:17 - worry about
50:19 - you know using learning another language
50:24 - sorry yawning a lot
50:28 - um
50:29 - yeah so those were the main things that
50:31 - attracted me to keystone i mean
50:33 - obviously open source mit license right
50:36 - i mean
50:37 - uh it seemed like it was somewhat
50:39 - you know easy to
50:41 - you know mess around with and change
50:44 - uh so
50:46 - that's what attracted me to it uh in the
50:48 - first place and it's i kept seeing it
50:51 - uh when i would look up
50:53 - like javascript cms
50:56 - it would come up
50:57 - frequently so
51:01 - i thought it was worth a try
51:09 - all right harshad says you can block
51:11 - offensive stuff in the settings i think
51:13 - we're already blocking offensive things
51:16 - um but i mean they're
51:18 - you can't block everything right uh
51:21 - there are a lot of things that
51:24 - won't get caught by those filters so
51:27 - i mean i'm
51:28 - i'm open to rethinking that if enough
51:30 - people think it would be of of a benefit
51:33 - to the stream
51:34 - you know to have the chat
51:36 - up on the on the screen like that
51:39 - um
51:40 - i'll reconsider it let me know and let
51:42 - me know what you all think i'm just
51:44 - gonna have to be like really vigilant
51:47 - about making sure that uh things don't
51:51 - get in
51:52 - you know on the stream
51:54 - um
51:56 - you know i want i want to keep this
51:57 - stream like you know pg rated you know
51:59 - because you know young young people uh
52:02 - you know watch this too you've had you
52:04 - know like
52:05 - young kids and things watch this show
52:07 - before uh so anyway
52:10 - uh
52:12 - i wouldn't
52:13 - i wouldn't want to
52:15 - you know expose them to anything that
52:17 - their parents wouldn't want them to see
52:21 - something
52:25 - all right cool man who says you asked
52:26 - for suggestions in the first video for
52:28 - cms i remember it i'm feeling good about
52:30 - this one of the life's goals
52:31 - accomplished
52:33 - awesome well i'm glad you're happy about
52:36 - it i'm glad i could i could help you
52:37 - accomplish one of your life goals here
52:40 - all right blake has to go see it blake
52:43 - yeah hopefully he'll be back tomorrow
52:45 - and uh all right let's see
52:48 - harshet
52:50 - har i see the ip address you just
52:52 - posted so uh i will check that out
53:03 - okay
53:05 - uh john b says maybe ask free code camp
53:07 - to provide a moderator for the streams
53:09 - or to potentially promote someone who
53:10 - watches these a lot to do moderation
53:14 - yeah okay
53:15 - i i
53:16 - that's actually not a bad idea i've
53:18 - thought about that before i always just
53:20 - thought if we end up getting a lot of
53:22 - people in the live chat that would be
