00:00 - what does the developer do day-to-day
00:01 - well one thing that I had to learn when
00:04 - I first started learning to code and I
00:05 - still have to do today is creating user
00:07 - stories
00:08 - what are user stories well stay tuned to
00:10 - find out now user story is a high-level
00:34 - definition of empowerment for your
00:36 - application that gives just enough
00:37 - information so a developer can give it
00:40 - estimation of how long it's going to
00:42 - take to complete that task simply put a
00:45 - user story describes how customer or
00:47 - user is going to use your application so
00:50 - in my experience an ITP M and K a
00:53 - project manager will go out and
00:55 - interview customer observe their
00:57 - environment and see what types of
00:58 - problems they're facing and then based
01:00 - off that research they create a user
01:02 - story so when I was first learning how
01:04 - to code I had to play every single role
01:07 - there was and developing a project so
01:09 - that included being a project manager I
01:11 - mean I had to create user stories on my
01:14 - own now this helped me learn about agile
01:17 - method methodology and it helped me to
01:20 - understand how important it was to make
01:22 - user stories and organizing a project
01:24 - and visualizing the workflow of a user
01:27 - so I encourage you to make user stories
01:30 - for all the projects that you have now
01:31 - that you're creating on your own before
01:33 - you get a new job or as you're
01:35 - transitioning into agile a team so the
01:38 - syntax is simple it goes as a blank
01:42 - which is a role I want to blink which
01:45 - says what and then so that I can why why
01:51 - do you want to do the what so let's say
01:53 - that we're building an application for
01:55 - dogs to meet other dogs in their city
01:57 - let's call it sniffs and wolves now this
02:00 - is kind of like meetup but for pet
02:01 - owners and dogs so from a user's
02:04 - perspective or customer aka a pet owner
02:07 - I might want
02:09 - for that for my pet to have a profile
02:12 - page and this is a requirement so my
02:15 - user story might go something like as a
02:17 - pet owner that's the role I want my pet
02:22 - to have a profile page that's the what
02:24 - so that other pet owners can see my pet
02:28 - before the initial meetup that's the one
02:31 - or a good one might be that as a pet
02:34 - owner I want my dog to have a profile
02:37 - page so that I can share stories with
02:40 - other pet owners so what do you think
02:43 - about creating a user story so far does
02:45 - it sound easy do you think you can put
02:47 - it into your next project tell me a
02:49 - little bit more about how you're gonna
02:50 - employ this in the comments below now I
02:53 - want to go a little bit deeper into why
02:54 - it's so important to create user stories
02:56 - so if you know who your target audience
02:59 - is you know exactly what you're building
03:01 - this application for this is your
03:03 - opportunity to have a conversation with
03:05 - them to figure out what they like what
03:08 - their problems are and to build that
03:10 - application so that they'll enjoy using
03:12 - it and then it solves their problem now
03:15 - if you don't know who your audience is
03:16 - this is the opportunity to figure it out
03:19 - this is the opportunity to create those
03:22 - audiences and to understand who they are
03:25 - and give your application towards them
03:27 - instead of trying to please everybody
03:28 - because fYI you can't also that last
03:33 - part of your user story that says so
03:35 - that that is something that should be
03:37 - testable you want to have test subjects
03:41 - later on and you want to have some words
03:43 - to push them so say the sole that says
03:46 - so that I can create stories and share
03:49 - stories with other pet owners now when
03:52 - I'm going through that as a developer or
03:55 - as a user who's about to use this
03:57 - application I should be able to see
03:59 - somewhere that I can create those
04:00 - stories and be able to share it with
04:03 - other users it's always good to test
04:05 - your applications so I also want to
04:08 - discuss two terms that you might come in
04:10 - contact with as you're diving more deep
04:12 - into creating user stories of your own
04:14 - and those terms are
04:16 - and personas now epics are kind of like
04:20 - user stories but they're way bigger and
04:23 - you really can't complete them in the
04:26 - two weeks that you're usually allotted
04:28 - to finish a user story so an epic allows
04:32 - you to get an overview of a feature
04:34 - without committing to any details
04:36 - they're really big and they're usually
04:39 - broken down into user stories so say for
04:43 - instance this was a book the epic might
04:46 - be the title of the book
04:48 - it's an overview it gives you an idea of
04:51 - what the book is about and it doesn't
04:53 - really give you too many details
04:54 - whereas a user story would be the
04:57 - chapters or even smaller they might be
04:59 - the sections in those chapters so an
05:02 - example of an epic might be to allow a
05:05 - customer to manage his or her account
05:07 - for their pet now as you can see this
05:10 - epic doesn't say what type of user it is
05:13 - it doesn't even tell you how yeah
05:15 - they're gonna manage the account it's
05:17 - just a broad overview of the feature and
05:19 - it's going to be broken down into
05:21 - various user stories so just know what
05:24 - an epic is so the second term was
05:27 - personas a lot of teams like to create
05:30 - personas instead of roles when they're
05:32 - creating user stories and personas are
05:34 - fictional characters that you create
05:36 - based off what you've learned about the
05:39 - people who are going to be using
05:40 - applications and those personas contain
05:43 - a name a picture a relevant
05:46 - characteristics and attitudes and they
05:49 - have a goal that should be solved by
05:51 - using your product so an example of a
05:53 - persona would be Natalie she's 26 she's
05:57 - an elementary school teacher and she
05:59 - loves to run marathons
06:01 - she loves pit bulls but she knows that
06:03 - they have a bad rep so she would love to
06:06 - help others fall in love with pit bulls
06:08 - by giving them good experiences through
06:10 - her own pit bull pets so that last part
06:14 - about Natalie wanted to help people fall
06:16 - in love with her pets through good
06:17 - experiences that was a goal and that
06:19 - goal should help me create epics which
06:22 - should help you create user stories and
06:23 - that epic should
06:25 - like the fiction out here but your
06:27 - application so now if you look back at
06:29 - all the work we've done for this
06:30 - fictitious there's an application called
06:32 - sniffs and Wolf's you should be able to
06:34 - have a great workflow to get you started
06:35 - on creating this app so let's go through
06:38 - them but persona Nathalie is 26 she is
06:42 - an elementary school teacher and a
06:43 - marathon runner
06:44 - she loves pit bulls but knows they have
06:46 - a bad rep she would love to help others
06:48 - fall in love with pit bulls by having
06:50 - good experiences with her pets the epic
06:54 - to allow the customers to manage his own
06:56 - account for their pet and finally the
06:59 - user story as a pet owner I want to have
07:02 - a profile for my pet so that I can share
07:04 - stories before the get-together or with
07:08 - a persona Nathalie a pet owner wants to
07:11 - have a profile for her pet so that she
07:13 - can share stories with other users and
07:16 - they can fall in love with that pet
07:17 - before the playdate so at this point you
07:20 - should be able to create your own
07:21 - personas epics and user stories for your
07:23 - own application if you enjoy this video
07:25 - give it a thumbs up and don't forget to
07:27 - subscribe below also I'd love to see you
07:30 - on Instagram and Twitter so join me by
07:32 - taking a picture of your user stories
07:34 - and acne or hashtag it coding like a
07:37 - boss see you later
