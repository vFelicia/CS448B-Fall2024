00:00 - in this video I'll be giving examples
00:02 - for subsets and supersets so if you look
00:05 - at this blue line here this represents
00:08 - our Universal Set uh We've defined it to
00:11 - be the integers from 1 to 11 that's 1 2
00:13 - 3 4 all the way up to 11 don't let it
00:16 - concern you that there are elements
00:18 - outside of our universe um that just
00:20 - means that they are I mean that just
00:22 - means they're not in the universe that
00:24 - we have in question right now so it's no
00:26 - different than having stars outside of
00:27 - your Galaxy you're not concerned by that
00:29 - it's just a matter of fact so if you
00:31 - look at this green line uh what what set
00:34 - would that be well it contains elements
00:36 - three beta and gamma so does b b
00:39 - contains three beta and gamma so this
00:41 - would be the set B likewise this set
00:45 - here it contains elements 3 1 and X well
00:49 - a contains 3 1 and X so this is the set
00:52 - a and finally this Set uh contains
00:55 - elements one and three this set contains
00:57 - elements one and three so this is the
00:58 - set C
01:01 - now what can be said about these sets
01:03 - well we have uh we can say that c is a
01:06 - subset of the universe because all
01:07 - elements of c are elements of the
01:10 - universe furthermore we can say that uh
01:13 - the set B is not a subset of the
01:17 - universe because there are elements of B
01:18 - that are not within the universe also we
01:21 - can say that the universe is not a
01:24 - subset a superset of a because there's
01:28 - elements of a that are not within uh or
01:32 - not contained by the
01:33 - universe and finally we can say that the
01:36 - universe is a proper suet of C because
01:40 - the universe contains all elements of C
01:44 - except and there are elements within the
01:46 - universe that are not within the set C
01:49 - so if we wanted to be more specific we
01:50 - could actually say that c is a proper
01:54 - subset of the universe
