00:00 - everything in HTML is a node that
00:03 - includes the document all HTML elements
00:06 - the text in the elements HTML attributes
00:09 - and comments these form a node tree all
00:13 - nodes in the tree can be accessed by
00:16 - JavaScript nodes can be created modified
00:19 - or deleted in a node tree the top node
00:23 - is called the root node so inside the
00:25 - document we have the root element which
00:27 - is HTML and then every node has exactly
00:30 - one parent except the root this element
00:34 - head node and the element body node each
00:37 - have the HTML node as the root node and
00:40 - the head and the body are children of
00:43 - the HTML node a node can have any number
00:46 - of children also siblings are nodes with
00:50 - the same parent so the head element is a
00:53 - sibling of the body element and this a
00:56 - element is a sibling of the H1 element
00:59 - and both these elements El have the body
01:01 - element as their parent element so here
01:04 - we're creating an element
01:06 - document.createelement and we're making
01:09 - it a paragraph a paragraph tag element
01:12 - then we have to add the text to the
01:14 - paragraph so we're going to create a
01:15 - text nodes so we have create text node
01:18 - here and it's going to add this text
01:22 - into that node and then we're going to
01:24 - append them together so we have the
01:26 - paragraph element that we created and
01:28 - then we have append child child and then
01:31 - the node this is the text that we
01:33 - created so the text node we created is a
01:36 - child of the paragraph node now we just
01:39 - have to add the node we created to the
01:42 - document we're going to set parent to
01:45 - equal document. getet element by ID div
01:48 - 1 that's this div one up here in the
01:51 - HTML and we're going to do parent.
01:55 - appendchild perah so we're going to add
01:57 - a new child node to this parent so to
01:59 - this div 1 where we're adding a new
02:01 - child node which is the node that we
02:03 - created up here so let me run that and
02:06 - we'll see it up in the HTML see now we
02:09 - just added up above the world so high at
02:12 - the end here we appended the child okay
02:14 - let's try something new here I'm going
02:17 - to create another paragraph par 2
02:20 - document. create element P that's the
02:22 - same thing we had in this line up here
02:24 - but we're going to add the text
02:26 - differently so one way to create the
02:28 - text is the create text node but you can
02:30 - also set the inner HTML to be the new
02:33 - text so this is also creating a new text
02:37 - node within the paragraph just this line
02:40 - is taking the place of these two lines
02:43 - and it does basically the same thing so
02:45 - now we're going to get another element
02:47 - on the page the child node is document.
02:49 - getet element by ID P1 we now have this
02:53 - node up here from the HTML and we're
02:56 - going to insert before before we did a
02:58 - pin child which always puts the new node
03:02 - at the end but you can also put in new
03:05 - nodes before other nodes so instead of
03:07 - parent. a pin child we have parent.
03:10 - insert before and the first thing we're
03:14 - going to pass in is what we're going to
03:16 - insert and then which is pair two that's
03:20 - this up here that we created and the
03:22 - second thing we're going to pass through
03:24 - is what we want it to be inserted before
03:27 - so we have the P1 up here which is the
03:30 - Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and we want
03:32 - to insert like a diamond in the sky
03:35 - before Twinkle Twinkle Little Star so
03:38 - let's run that and see what happens yep
03:41 - just like what I said it inserts it
03:43 - before Twinkle Twinkle Little Star I'm
03:45 - going to show you two more things in
03:47 - this video replacing a child and
03:49 - removing a child so these first two
03:52 - lines we're just creating another
03:54 - paragraph element we have par of three
03:57 - and it's going to be a paragraph element
03:58 - and we're going to put in the text when
04:00 - the blazing sun is gone and now we're
04:02 - going to get the parent node that's the
04:05 - div the div one replace child and the
04:10 - first thing we're going to pass in is
04:11 - what the the new element is that we're
04:13 - going to be putting in the second thing
04:15 - we're going to be passing in is what we
04:18 - want to be replaced so remember Child is
04:20 - This P1 up here that's the Twinkle
04:23 - Twinkle Little Star but now we want to
04:25 - replace it with this new line this new
04:28 - paragraph so let's try that and it's
04:31 - replaced it doesn't say Twinkle Twinkle
04:33 - Little Star anymore it says when the
04:35 - blazing sun is gone and then the last
04:37 - thing I want to show you is removing a
04:38 - child so we have parent that's the div
04:42 - again remove child and we just pass in
04:45 - what we want to remove we want to remove
04:47 - pair three which is what we just added
04:50 - so if we run that it does not say when
04:54 - the blazing sun is gone anymore we've
04:56 - removed that child thanks for watching
