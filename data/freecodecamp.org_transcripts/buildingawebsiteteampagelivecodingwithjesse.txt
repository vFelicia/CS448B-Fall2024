00:06 - hey everybody is Jessie I'm a front-end
00:09 - developer and this livestream is just
00:12 - about showing people what I do so
00:16 - whatever I happen to be working on at
00:19 - this time of day
00:20 - pretty much every day every weekday you
00:24 - guys will see I want you to see all my
00:28 - mistakes interruptions everything that
00:31 - would happen in a normal day so this is
00:33 - entirely unscripted and hopefully I'll
00:36 - give you just a little glimpse of how at
00:38 - least one front-end developer does his
00:41 - work we are in the middle of a project
00:46 - let me give you a quick recap I have
00:48 - some info in the description for this
00:51 - livestream and I also have some videos
00:55 - I've done before this of one other video
00:57 - on this channel free code camp and then
00:59 - I have some other videos on my channel
01:02 - and the link is in the description so we
01:08 - have a partially finished website that
01:12 - I'm going to take and finish but I'm
01:16 - finishing it kind of in a different
01:18 - format so the partially finished website
01:20 - was built with Drupal we're going to
01:22 - build this first it's just a static HTML
01:25 - site and then eventually we're going to
01:28 - convert that to react components and
01:30 - we're going to render that server-side
01:32 - and all the content is going to be
01:35 - pulled in from WordPress through the
01:38 - WordPress API so the react site will
01:44 - exist on a different server from the
01:46 - WordPress site and all the content will
01:50 - come from there but we'll set all that
01:52 - up and in the weeks to come for now we
01:57 - need to get this site finished and ready
01:59 - to go by Monday and the site actually
02:04 - has to launch probably by the 13th so I
02:08 - want to get it done by Monday so that we
02:10 - have at least a few days for testing and
02:13 - making
02:13 - Changez if you have any other questions
02:17 - about why we're doing this or background
02:19 - for the project just put them in the
02:21 - comments you can put them in the live
02:23 - chat too but if there's a lot of people
02:25 - in the latch at it's hard for me to keep
02:28 - track of it so if I do miss your
02:30 - question a lot of chat just put it in
02:31 - the comments and then I'll get to it
02:33 - later later on and I try to answer
02:36 - everybody that their comments if you're
02:42 - returning thanks for watching yesterday
02:43 - the response was amazing I think we have
02:46 - over 5,000 views on yesterday's video
02:48 - and in 24 hours which is which is crazy
02:52 - I live in a town that has maybe 18,000
02:55 - people at most so to get 5,000 views in
02:57 - a day on one of my videos it's just
02:59 - really great and I had so much positive
03:02 - feedback out of lots of thumbs up only
03:06 - four thumbs down which is great if you
03:12 - do thumbs down the video that's that's
03:14 - fine with me but it would be cool if you
03:16 - comment below and give me some feedback
03:18 - so I can make this stream better I think
03:22 - I mean I'm definitely welcome to
03:24 - feedback I mean if you're mean about it
03:26 - I mean that stinks but I'll I'll be able
03:29 - to handle it
03:30 - alright so enough introduction let's
03:34 - just get to it here's what we've been
03:37 - working on not a whole lot has changed
03:40 - since yesterday at least visibly a lot
03:43 - of the work that I've done has just been
03:44 - on the mobile breakpoints making sure
03:47 - the positioning is okay so PC is as I
03:50 - shrink this down everything still looks
03:52 - pretty good I added a slight border on
03:55 - the bottom here to me that it just
03:58 - looked a little bit better with that
03:59 - border I'm not I'm not entirely sold on
04:02 - it it might change let me know what you
04:04 - think but it I was just used to seeing
04:09 - this read up against the black and not
04:11 - the black straight on the white so it it
04:14 - just seemed nicer to have a little bit
04:16 - of that red there and let me show you
04:21 - this is an interior page and let me show
04:23 - you on the home page we did make some
04:24 - changes
04:27 - so you still have this and this one is
04:30 - actually growing on me I know I said
04:31 - yesterday I might change it but you will
04:33 - see I'm getting used to it and so it
04:36 - might stay and then now once we get
04:38 - smaller everything's still looking
04:40 - pretty good when we get to a certain
04:42 - point when the image and the font would
04:45 - normally squish together we actually
04:47 - just switch right back to that interior
04:49 - header so it'll look the same as the
04:52 - interior pages also if the screen is
04:57 - short it will switch back but just in
05:01 - case somebody has a really big phone and
05:03 - they're in landscape mode it's possible
05:07 - that their screen is would be wide
05:08 - enough to not hit that break point but
05:11 - still short enough so that the text
05:14 - would actually be all up here the
05:16 - tagline text and it would cover up the
05:17 - logo so that's why I did you'd see here
05:21 - in this media query this is how I did
05:24 - that I said it max with inside of media
05:26 - create 600 pixels and then a comma which
05:29 - basically acts like an or if you're
05:31 - writing a media query comma and then I
05:34 - added that max height as well so I just
05:38 - pop those in just on the few elements
05:41 - the header the nav the logo the few
05:44 - elements that needed to change you see
05:47 - where the entire hero section is just
05:49 - completely not even displayed and this
05:51 - will help us too because we won't need
05:52 - to make as many image sizes for all the
05:55 - different screen sizes before I think we
05:57 - had three or four different media
06:00 - queries so we have all these different
06:01 - image sizes now we won't have to mess
06:03 - with that for today's video what I want
06:09 - to work on is this page this team page
06:11 - and as I said this is coming from a site
06:14 - that is partially finished so let me
06:16 - show you what we have to work with in
06:17 - terms of the content that's already
06:19 - there and it's not it's going to be a
06:29 - little bit of a challenge okay so here's
06:30 - the current team page from from the site
06:37 - that's unfinished
06:39 - I haven't
06:40 - eruption so this is this is great from
06:42 - me let me check it real quick sorry
06:48 - Jesse you're active I'm really sorry
06:51 - it's all I got
06:52 - okay okay that's awesome I'm actually
06:58 - glad interruption because that's like a
07:00 - normal normal day you can't always just
07:04 - have all your time to completely focus
07:06 - on the code that was actually the head
07:09 - of the department that I'm building this
07:11 - site for so that was that was cool he's
07:15 - a super nice guy he was really
07:16 - apologetic for interrupting the
07:17 - livestream okay so let's see this team
07:22 - page so right now obviously we've
07:27 - already changed the header you know this
07:29 - this isn't going to be here I think this
07:31 - is just too much stuff at the top
07:32 - without seeing the content I'm not I'm
07:37 - not entirely thrilled about this large
07:38 - block of text I don't like the font it
07:42 - just seems kind of difficult to read
07:44 - maybe it just maybe it just needs to be
07:47 - bigger or maybe not the white on the
07:50 - dark red either way you know we're going
07:53 - to change it we're probably not even
07:54 - going to have this this block of text at
07:57 - all or you know we definitely should cut
07:59 - it down and break it up
08:00 - I'm a big fan of really just minimal
08:04 - text on pages and if you have some
08:07 - interior pages that people expect have a
08:10 - lot of text like a blog post people
08:13 - expect to read that's fine but on a page
08:16 - like this I don't think anybody would
08:18 - expect to click on teams and the first
08:19 - thing they get is a very large paragraph
08:22 - what they're expecting is you know
08:24 - probably this and their BIOS for the
08:27 - people who are on the team this is
08:30 - actually the person that just
08:33 - interrupted the last shame accidentally
08:36 - so I'm Adam he's what a nice is sketchy
08:39 - over me so right now they have this this
08:44 - kind of accordion there's a couple of
08:47 - problems it's not it's not that easy for
08:50 - the people that are in charge of the
08:52 - content they don't have any experience
08:54 - is with code and they're not going to
08:56 - and that's fine but they need a way to
08:59 - edit this easily and right now this
09:01 - entire section here which goes on for a
09:04 - while is all one big kind of WYSIWYG
09:08 - section so in the the admin panel and
09:12 - Drupal you know they literally had to
09:15 - type out all of this and try to position
09:16 - the images and it's hard enough to do
09:20 - that if you know code you know let alone
09:23 - if you're just trying to put this you
09:26 - know put this in with with little
09:27 - background I'm going to check the
09:29 - lighter so I can see if I need any
09:32 - answer anything yeah these will all be
09:37 - available afterwards so somebody just
09:41 - asked if if these will be available yeah
09:43 - they are so the some of my previous ones
09:46 - are available in my youtube channel and
09:48 - that's linked in the description and
09:49 - then yesterday I just started streaming
09:51 - on free code camp so yesterday's is
09:53 - available there so between the two
09:55 - channels you'll be able to get
09:57 - everything and if you have any other
09:58 - questions just let me know in the
09:59 - comments and I'll be happy to answer
10:01 - them I'd like to do some shorter videos
10:03 - that are pre-recorded and just kind of
10:05 - explaining things in more depth and in
10:09 - this format it's like oh you're welcome
10:11 - and this format it's just kind of I
10:14 - don't think it's the best format for
10:16 - teaching I don't want to mislead anybody
10:19 - by forgetting something or leaving it
10:21 - out so I really like to take time to
10:23 - kind of prepare and do a nice video edit
10:25 - everything so if you know this would be
10:28 - more of the teaching videos I'm sure
10:30 - that and I hope that you'll learn
10:32 - something with with the live streams but
10:34 - this is just more kind of a glimpse into
10:36 - my my day okay so the one problem with
10:42 - this is the fact that it's not easy to
10:44 - edit for the people that need to be to
10:47 - update this content the second thing is
10:51 - the the formatting is just not really
10:54 - and this is it's just not you can see
11:01 - it's it's not uniform okay we have all
11:03 - the image sizes or all different sizes
11:05 - some of them are aligned differently
11:08 - there's a lot going on not only that
11:10 - there's there's some just weird issues
11:12 - when you click this you'll wind up in
11:16 - the middle so I think I want to get away
11:17 - from I want to get away from the
11:20 - accordion I'm still thinking about maybe
11:22 - some sort of accordion for mobile just
11:24 - to cut down on the amount of scrolling
11:26 - that somebody would have to do on a
11:27 - phone but there's a lot of little BIOS
11:34 - here in pictures a lot so we need some
11:37 - way to be able to display these that's
11:41 - that's not going to seem really
11:42 - cluttered so here's my idea I was going
11:45 - a little bit of sketching earlier and
11:48 - was actually as to the meeting so if you
11:51 - guys are work for a company or something
11:53 - you have frequent meetings always bring
11:55 - a sketch pad or something because you
11:57 - get ideas and and I got some ideas for
11:59 - this in the middle of meeting and I
12:00 - sketched it out so you're obviously not
12:02 - going to be able to see my sketch I
12:03 - probably should have taken a picture of
12:05 - it first to show you but I'll just
12:07 - explain it what I'm kind of thinking is
12:09 - maybe some horizontal like material type
12:15 - design style cards actually I can't show
12:17 - you an example I'm using the
12:19 - materialized framework it's kind of like
12:22 - you know bootstrap or foundation but
12:24 - with a material design you'll kind of
12:28 - build into it so let me show you how
12:30 - they do their horizontal cars and this
12:34 - is kind of a newer thing when I first
12:35 - started using materialized they didn't
12:37 - have horizontal cards actually had to
12:39 - get a kind of adjust the cards that they
12:43 - did have to make them but then they
12:44 - added horizontal cards and they're
12:46 - awesome so this is the documentation for
12:49 - materialized so this one I'm talking
12:50 - about a horizontal card so we'll have an
12:52 - image here and then a little bit of text
12:56 - and in this case they have a link here
12:58 - I'm thinking for right now
13:03 - maybe the link would actually open up a
13:06 - modal that would have more information
13:09 - because we can't possibly put all that
13:11 - text that's in the bio here and that
13:14 - link I think there's a possibility there
13:17 - could be YouTube videos for a lot of
13:21 - these
13:21 - team members at some point on the road
13:24 - so the modal would also work for that as
13:26 - well you can definitely do a YouTube
13:28 - embed in a modal and and that would work
13:32 - I think that would that would look fun
13:33 - so for now that's the plan we're going
13:36 - to put those all those images and
13:39 - actually I'd like to make the images
13:41 - square if I could I think that's the
13:44 - only way I'm going to be able to get all
13:46 - these images the same size the the
13:48 - chances of actually finding pictures
13:50 - that are all the same or taking pictures
13:52 - for all these people or just it's not
13:53 - going to happen not all of them are even
13:56 - here on campus so we just can't do it
13:59 - but I think if we go square you know
14:03 - every one of these pictures could
14:05 - possibly be edited to be a square and at
14:08 - least show somebody's face so that's
14:11 - what we're going to go with I just hope
14:12 - that they're big enough so that I could
14:14 - get a decent sized square but the
14:17 - horizontal cards as you can see are they
14:19 - aren't really that big they don't have
14:20 - to be that big so that's the plan so
14:22 - we're going to grab some of this code
14:23 - for a horizontal card and let's put it
14:28 - in a page to see how it looks and see
14:31 - how it looks when we put a bunch of them
14:32 - in there just to get a feel for like
14:34 - will this actually work okay somebody
14:41 - asked how long I've been using
14:42 - materialized framework I've actually
14:45 - been using materialized for about two
14:49 - years I think about two years so when I
14:54 - first started using it I wasn't exactly
14:57 - sure if it was production ready or not
14:58 - there were definitely some live sites
15:00 - that were using it I never had any
15:02 - problems any major problems with
15:04 - anything you know breaking there was
15:07 - some like on edge cases mostly having to
15:10 - do with putting like a lot of text as
15:13 - the title in a card or something and
15:15 - having some so weird things happen when
15:17 - it wrapped onto another line but all in
15:24 - all I think it's a good framework the
15:26 - only thing that I don't like about it
15:28 - now that it really it's it's part of a
15:32 - lot of frameworks is that it requires
15:33 - jQuery and so
15:35 - I'm no problem with jQuery I use it on a
15:37 - lot of my sites but I'm starting to get
15:39 - more into react and from everything I've
15:42 - read about reacts you really shouldn't
15:44 - use jQuery with it it's not that it
15:46 - won't work but it's better not to use it
15:50 - I'm not a react expert but it has to do
15:53 - with the way react tracks the Dom it has
15:56 - this virtual Dom and if you change the
16:01 - Dom with jQuery after the fact that it
16:04 - loads it can mess up react to them so
16:07 - that's I don't know any more in detail
16:09 - about it but so at some point I would
16:12 - really love to I don't kind of convert
16:17 - materialized framework to react
16:19 - components and rewrite everything and
16:23 - just vanilla JavaScript I think there
16:26 - are already some people trying to do
16:27 - that so maybe I'll just check out their
16:29 - repo and try to contribute to that so
16:33 - someday someday hopefully I'll get that
16:35 - done but for now I'm just I'm going to
16:38 - keep working with it it just saves so
16:40 - much time now they put in a lot a lot of
16:42 - work into this this framework and it
16:46 - works well
16:50 - so we asked why am i doing so many divs
16:53 - yeah that's just that's just how the
16:55 - framework is with with all these divs so
17:01 - when you're using a framework you can't
17:04 - you're kind of locked into how they have
17:06 - things set up I don't know if I would
17:08 - use that many gives if I was doing it
17:10 - from scratch but I've it's actually not
17:13 - that bad compared to how many divs are
17:15 - used in the like this current site that
17:18 - I'm using kind of as my example to go
17:21 - off of there's a lot of divs in there
17:24 - all right so let's put this in and I'm
17:28 - going to put it I'd like to see what it
17:29 - looks like on both these backgrounds on
17:31 - the white background and on the red
17:34 - background so I'm going to put it in
17:36 - both those places so here's here's our
17:39 - HTML for that page you see from
17:42 - yesterday actually went through and
17:44 - duplicated this and all the pages for
17:46 - the main menu just so you know
17:48 - have them be able to to work on them on
17:52 - okay all right so this section let's pop
17:57 - in let's pop this in here pop one of
18:06 - these in I guess I didn't need this
18:13 - header okay and let's go ahead and put
18:26 - this let's put another one down here
18:33 - whoops I didn't grab the columns too
18:37 - sorry if this is confusing to you you
18:40 - know there's there's kind of a lot this
18:42 - is kind of the grid system the column
18:43 - system for materialised check out I have
18:46 - a link in the description so if you
18:48 - check out their documentation it should
18:49 - make a lot more sense all the source
18:51 - code for this is on github as well for
18:53 - the project that I'm doing so you can
18:56 - follow along I'll try to keep that I'll
18:58 - try to push changes right after I'm done
19:00 - with the video and then that way it'll
19:02 - be all up-to-date for you and if you if
19:07 - you want to you know submit a pull
19:11 - request or something to contribute to
19:12 - the project that would be awesome too
19:14 - I'm definitely up for that alright so
19:17 - let's see what the scale is okay um I
19:21 - mean let me change the columns I wanted
19:25 - to see how this looked like side by side
19:27 - so we have if we change this to m6 this
19:32 - is out of a twelve column layout so if
19:35 - we give it m6 that means on a
19:37 - medium-sized screen it'll take up six of
19:40 - those twelve columns so this should be
19:41 - side by side okay side by side and I
19:47 - once again I forgot to take out this
19:50 - header okay all right so we have these
19:55 - side by side it's not that this this is
20:00 - a little bit of problem though
20:02 - see how this image looks when when we
20:05 - have too much text if we're going to do
20:13 - the horizontal cards like this we got to
20:16 - make sure we've got to make sure there's
20:19 - definitely a limit on how much text can
20:21 - be in here to make sure we don't I don't
20:26 - like that at the bottom that makes it
20:28 - look kind of like it's it's broken
20:31 - so we'll have to watch out for that I'll
20:35 - work on that at some point later today
20:38 - just to check it but if if we can get it
20:42 - to the point where whenever we're not
20:43 - seeing that gap at the bottom I think
20:45 - these will work this will allow us to do
20:47 - two columns instead of one long column
20:49 - for all the team members we can I think
20:55 - we can alternate the white sections and
20:57 - the red sections to differentiate
21:00 - between all those different categories
21:02 - that we saw let me go back to our
21:03 - example so we had that you know four
21:10 - categories here so I think we could do
21:12 - like you know we could definitely do the
21:14 - four categories the only one I'm worried
21:17 - about is the second one I think there's
21:18 - like 37 different people that we need
21:21 - two different BIOS we need to put in
21:23 - that's a lot it's a lot of scrolling
21:27 - okay so here's what we'll do right now
21:30 - I'm going to copy these a little bit I
21:33 - said I want to check out how they look
21:35 - on this background and I just want to
21:38 - get a feel for how did these stack I'm
21:42 - going to chain move the screen in a
21:44 - little bit normally um I wouldn't be
21:51 - doing making so many design decisions as
21:54 - I'm developing this is kind of a special
21:57 - case this project has a super tight
22:00 - timeline and I didn't even know at the
22:02 - beginning the week that I'd be working
22:03 - on it so that's why we're combining
22:06 - those steps it's usually better to kind
22:10 - of have the design more lock down at
22:12 - first before you do this I don't
22:16 - I'm doing it like this but sometimes
22:19 - it's you waste a little bit of time
22:22 - trying things that end up not working
22:23 - and if you would have just maybe planned
22:26 - them out in Photoshop or sketch or
22:28 - whatever the new thing adobe has that's
22:31 - that's like sketch I can't really what
22:32 - is called you plant it on something like
22:34 - that first it could save you might be
22:36 - able save you some time I guess it just
22:38 - depends on whether you're faster with
22:40 - code or faster with Photoshop all right
22:43 - so let's just grab some of these and and
22:46 - copy and paste them just to give us a
22:49 - more realistic look for how this will be
22:51 - when we get a lot of a lot of these in
22:54 - here I'm just going to pop in so that
22:57 - was really quick but what I did is is I
22:59 - copied the whole row so this div is a
23:02 - row div and then inside each row we have
23:05 - two columns if we can I'd love to go on
23:09 - a bigger screen maybe even up to three
23:11 - columns if it'll work so maybe we can
23:14 - test that out maybe not today because we
23:17 - have about seven minutes left maybe I'll
23:19 - try it out later and show you tomorrow
23:21 - if it worked and where's the red section
23:25 - I want to get into under that red
23:28 - section up here there we go and let's
23:32 - pop in a couple of these in there as
23:35 - well it should look about the same in
23:38 - the red section I'm just what I'm really
23:39 - worried about is just that white right
23:42 - up against the red and just just kind of
23:44 - seeing if it works sometimes you just
23:46 - don't know until you get it on the page
23:48 - whoa okay well this is cool
23:53 - somewhere I have it set to have white
23:56 - text inside which makes sense because
23:58 - you want the white text against the red
23:59 - background so that's an easy fix we'll
24:04 - scroll up to the top and materialize
24:08 - there we go to this class called white
24:11 - text that's one of their helper classes
24:14 - they're building the framework that is
24:17 - probably where we're getting that style
24:18 - from so if I take that out there we go
24:21 - we have the text with modders yeah I've
24:26 - had a couple people are asking will this
24:29 - be recorded
24:30 - the video gets automatically uploaded to
24:32 - the channel really kind of minutes after
24:35 - the livestream ends so if you jumped in
24:38 - the middle you know just check out the
24:40 - the recording of it later I mean it it's
24:44 - usually like five minutes or less the
24:46 - seems like the video is posted okay and
24:53 - like I said earlier in case you didn't
24:56 - catch that if you're asking something a
24:58 - live chat and I miss it because it is a
25:00 - little bit hard to keep up with the live
25:01 - chat and do the code just ask it in the
25:04 - comments because I'll read the comments
25:05 - afterwards and I'll try to get back to
25:07 - you as soon as I can okay
25:11 - this doesn't look terrible I really kind
25:15 - of don't like that it's so uniformed all
25:17 - the way down I was a little bit afraid
25:20 - of that I think there needs to be
25:23 - something to break this up so we need
25:27 - some sections my my first idea is this
25:30 - all this big block of text here that we
25:34 - kind of don't want in a big block maybe
25:37 - rework the text and actually my boss is
25:41 - great at this he always handles tech
25:43 - stuff for me which is awesome because I
25:46 - don't want to deal with tech stuff and
25:48 - it usually takes me a long time maybe we
25:52 - can say okay we want like three sections
25:54 - you want this broken out into three
25:56 - sections we can do a much bigger font
25:58 - maybe like a responsive font so it the
26:00 - font size changes with screen size I
26:02 - really like that materialise has that
26:04 - built in as well and then we can have
26:09 - maybe some some different colored
26:10 - sections in between possibly you know we
26:16 - could possibly have all these cards on
26:18 - white sections and then the text on the
26:22 - red sections or we could do maybe some
26:24 - sort of parallax section with with an
26:27 - image that might work to break things up
26:32 - we can actually test that out right now
26:35 - let's here's a good good way to test
26:39 - this will be to let's grab
26:43 - all of this that we just put here all of
26:47 - these rows hopefully I can I can catch
26:51 - the right spot here section yeah this is
26:59 - it hopefully I can grab yeah
27:11 - okay pretty much you have everything I
27:14 - got one extra did that I didn't need so
27:17 - let's just add that back in and for now
27:20 - we'll just let's pop in an H and H tune
27:22 - and just be text and we'll pop in a
27:30 - paragraph tag and just put we should be
27:33 - able to
27:34 - let's give it a class of flow text
27:38 - within materialized this will give us
27:40 - kind of a responsive effect on our font
27:43 - it will change font sizes and I think if
27:46 - there we go I'm using Adam as my cutted
27:49 - editor and I think this is built-in it's
27:51 - possible it's from some plug-in I loaded
27:53 - a long time ago I forgot about but if we
27:56 - can just type in lorem and hit tab and
27:58 - it gives us some lorem ipsum text wow
28:00 - that's a lot okay so that's cool we can
28:04 - see the lorem ipsum and here's what I
28:07 - want to do I'm just going to take this
28:10 - section we'll leave that heading and I
28:13 - want to keep that heading in actually
28:15 - we'll leave that whole row so is the row
28:17 - stuff and we'll pop in all that stuff
28:19 - all those cars that were the read
28:20 - section and now they're going to be in
28:22 - the section on the top and that'll let
28:23 - us see what it looks like when we have a
28:25 - divider okay um that's not terrible it
28:28 - doesn't look too and we took out the
28:31 - white text class so let's put that back
28:34 - in I'm somewhat new to live streaming so
28:40 - if you couldn't already tell and what I
28:44 - found over the last couple of weeks is
28:46 - that you miss little things that you
28:48 - would probably never miss normally when
28:51 - you're trying to talk at the same time
28:53 - as as code so I'm not quite such a noob
28:58 - as I have here today I have one eye when
29:01 - I live steering okay that does break
29:05 - things up a bit I don't know if you guys
29:08 - can see it but it seemed to me yeah it
29:14 - seems to me like it's not quite as it's
29:16 - just monotonous and repetitive okay
29:20 - I'm happy enough with that that I think
29:22 - it's worthwhile to go through and
29:24 - actually
29:25 - you know maybe try out three columns try
29:28 - to try to get this to the image to
29:31 - always look good put in maybe some a few
29:35 - real images from from the ones that
29:37 - we're actually going to use yeah I think
29:40 - that's worth whoa all right so I'm
29:43 - coming to the end of my stream got about
29:45 - a minute left oh thanks I'm getting some
29:50 - real positive feedback there
29:52 - thank you and I'm serious if you have
29:54 - any tips for me you know I'm for my code
29:57 - I always been trying to get better and
29:59 - for my live streams I I'm really new so
30:01 - I know I can get better at this so I
30:03 - really love the positive feedback but I
30:07 - welcome some criticism as well I have
30:11 - one question here that I think I can
30:12 - answer before we run out of time
30:13 - and it's can you make a video how to set
30:16 - up the Adam editor for most efficiency
30:18 - okay I can make a where do you tip I
30:22 - must I don't have a tip button right now
30:24 - maybe I actually purposely did not want
30:27 - to seem like I'm trying to do this for
30:29 - any type of money at all at first uh
30:31 - maybe one day if it starts taking up a
30:34 - lot of my time it might make more sense
30:36 - to ask for tips
30:38 - but right now I'm actually doing this at
30:41 - my regular job my boss is awesome and he
30:43 - realizes how how much value that there
30:46 - isn't something like this so I just
30:49 - wouldn't feel right getting paid on top
30:51 - of my normal wage for doing this but if
30:54 - I start doing more videos I definitely
30:57 - will as for the video about Adam I'm
31:00 - writing it down right now and I'm not
31:04 - sure that I have the best set up I'm
31:06 - there's I'm fact I know there's got to
31:09 - be people that have better more
31:11 - efficient setups than me but I will
31:12 - definitely share the way I have it set
31:14 - up and maybe maybe that will help but
31:16 - maybe you can improve on it should do a
31:20 - mobile-first
31:21 - yeah you're right about the mobile first
31:24 - sorry I'm going over a little bit as
31:25 - trying to answer some more questions
31:26 - here the the comment was most users will
31:30 - be your website through mobile instead
31:32 - of a desktop or laptop
31:34 - this is this is kind of I'm really glad
31:36 - that you said that in this case some of
31:39 - the people that I'm working with for
31:41 - this site we're kind of trying to get a
31:44 - feel for the audience and there's been
31:48 - some talk that the audience isn't going
31:50 - to be a mobile-first audience is going
31:51 - to be an older audience but I agree with
31:53 - you I think the even if it is an older
31:56 - audience we still should do a mobile
31:58 - first so normally that is how I do
32:00 - things in this case I didn't partially
32:06 - because I'm kind of working from an
32:07 - already partially completed site but
32:11 - you're right normally I would do all the
32:13 - Styles focused really small and then
32:16 - kind of go up maybe I'll switch up to
32:18 - that but that's definitely a good tip I
32:21 - highly recommend that if you're starting
32:23 - a project from scratch do everything
32:26 - with the mobile in mind and then then
32:30 - start to expand the screen and say okay
32:33 - what else can we add now and then that
32:35 - way your users won't feel like mobile as
32:37 - an afterthought you know you put most of
32:39 - your thought into the mobile experience
32:40 - and the desktop will feel really clean
32:43 - and not cluttered because you know you
32:46 - all your content is off the most for
32:48 - mobile so anyway I don't want to make
32:51 - this video too long and be intimidating
32:53 - for people to watch it again thanks for
32:56 - all the feedback if you have any more
32:59 - questions leave them in the comments
33:00 - check out I have some links down below
33:04 - for some of the tools that I'm using and
33:06 - places where you can see the code and
33:08 - everything and I'll be back tomorrow at
33:12 - 2 p.m. I'm going to do the stream on
33:15 - free code camp channel again if I do
33:17 - some of those videos like on Adam or
33:19 - some other things some short tutorial
33:21 - videos I'll probably throw those on my
33:23 - my personal channel and so thanks thanks
33:27 - for all the feedback and everything else
33:30 - getting throughout the video I'll see
33:32 - you tomorrow
