00:08 - hey everyone it's Jessie and today is
00:12 - the last day that I will be working on
00:17 - this project so so far for all of my
00:21 - streams for free code camp I've been
00:23 - working on this one project this react
00:27 - site and today's the last day so I'm
00:31 - really excited I'm excited to move on to
00:34 - my next project I'm not actually
00:36 - entirely sure what my next project will
00:39 - be there's a couple of different options
00:41 - my boss is still on his honeymoon I
00:44 - think he gets back today
00:46 - she might be um by now I'm not sure but
00:49 - he'll be in tomorrow and then we'll
00:52 - we'll decide together what my next
00:54 - project will be but there's a good
00:55 - chance it'll be another react another
00:59 - react site so before I get started today
01:05 - I just want to give a birthday shout out
01:08 - to a friend of mine
01:13 - Zach Levin Dorf who's I hope he doesn't
01:16 - mind me giving this shout out like this
01:18 - but I just wanted to mention him on on
01:21 - this stream because if it wasn't for him
01:23 - I probably would not be here doing this
01:25 - stream like I wouldn't be a developer at
01:27 - all so I don't know maybe five years ago
01:33 - or so something like like that I really
01:37 - needed a job and I was about to take a
01:39 - job that I didn't even really want to do
01:41 - but it was just going to be something to
01:43 - pay the bills and he offered me a job
01:49 - doing basically subcontracting work for
01:52 - him and he had like a media marketing
01:55 - company and
01:57 - he I had known him before and I had
02:01 - known his family so he knew that I was a
02:04 - decent guy and so he gave me a chance
02:06 - even though I hadn't built any websites
02:08 - for a really long time
02:11 - and he actually would would tell me like
02:15 - hey I'll pay you for so many hours just
02:17 - go learn how to do this and I'll pay you
02:18 - for it which was really cool because I
02:22 - really you know I had a few kids at the
02:24 - time and I really needed the money and I
02:27 - didn't have a lot of a lot of time to go
02:30 - and learn on my own I needed to be
02:32 - working so that really helped so for a
02:35 - few years I did a lot of work with him
02:37 - and anyway so I'm not sure if he's gonna
02:41 - watch or not I told him I was gonna give
02:42 - him a shout-out so I just wanted to to
02:46 - tell him happy birthday and just let
02:50 - everybody know how important it is he
02:51 - was kind of like a mentor to me at a
02:54 - time when I was just starting out and
02:55 - not really sure what I wanted to do so
02:58 - if you have a chance to do something
03:00 - like that for someone definitely do that
03:09 - it doesn't have to be I guess like an
03:11 - official mentor like you know he he
03:14 - wasn't my mentor officially Wicker we
03:16 - worked together but he taught me a lot
03:19 - about freelancing in general you know
03:21 - how to handle clients and contracts and
03:23 - billing and you know a lot of things
03:25 - like that a lot about WordPress and
03:28 - about search engine optimization and and
03:33 - he was he's a really good designer as
03:36 - well so he taught me a lot about design
03:37 - and yes that was that was cool we had we
03:43 - spent we spent a lot of time we would
03:46 - just stay up all night and work on build
03:48 - websites and those were some of the best
03:52 - learning experiences you know because we
03:55 - would take a break and get something to
03:56 - eat
03:56 - and just and talk for awhile in between
04:01 - coding sessions and that was really
04:03 - important for me when I was just
04:05 - starting out so if you ever have a
04:06 - chance to do that with somebody that's
04:08 - just starting out
04:09 - it'll definitely make a big difference
04:11 - to them it might not might not be that
04:13 - big of a deal to you it might not be
04:15 - that hard for you to do but it can make
04:17 - a big impact on someone so I hope that I
04:21 - can have that same impact on somebody
04:23 - one day and kind of pay it forward but
04:29 - I'm gonna check the live chat yeah
04:31 - actually
04:32 - Patrick is asking what happened to the
04:34 - viewer count yeah this is really weird
04:39 - so usually at the beginning of the
04:42 - streams the analytics there's some lag
04:46 - time or something so it shows like zero
04:47 - viewers for a minute or so but actually
04:50 - this is really this is really odd
04:53 - because it's showing three viewers and
04:55 - it should have already refreshed so
05:00 - anyway yeah Patrick I don't know what
05:02 - happened the last time something like
05:04 - this happened I didn't realize it but I
05:07 - think I was streaming during like
05:08 - Facebook's livestream of of one of their
05:12 - conferences so maybe maybe there's
05:19 - something happening that I'm missing I
05:21 - don't really know but I did let me
05:27 - double check I usually put the link on
05:31 - on Twitter yeah I did at 2:00 p.m.
05:34 - Eastern time I put the link on Twitter I
05:39 - put the right time okay did everything I
05:46 - the the tweet has it hasn't gone out to
05:49 - that many people but yeah I did
05:55 - everything right I mean I did send it
05:56 - out you know less than an hour ago but
06:03 - yeah I don't really know what's what's
06:06 - going on but it's fine with me I still
06:09 - need to do the work anyway so I mean I
06:13 - hope I didn't do anything wrong and
06:14 - people are like I hope people aren't
06:16 - getting blocked out of seeing this but
06:21 - let me I guess really quickly I'm going
06:26 - to go on another browser and try to to
06:29 - watch the stream I should be able to
06:35 - just maybe do an incognito window and
06:42 - let's see
06:53 - all right so I'm gonna go on my other
06:55 - screen I'm going to freak out camp yeah
06:57 - it does say live now free code camp I'm
07:02 - gonna try to click it okay cool I was
07:07 - able to get in and watch so but it does
07:09 - say yeah there's only six people
07:11 - watching that's crazy
07:12 - alright well anyway you know actually
07:17 - the the title that I gave the video was
07:20 - not really enticing I just said it was
07:23 - finishing my react site so maybe people
07:26 - aren't really interested in seeing me
07:29 - finish this usually I'm more a more
07:31 - descriptive title so maybe maybe that's
07:36 - why or maybe there's something else live
07:38 - that's really important I mean did
07:40 - something crazy happen on the news and
07:42 - I'm just not aware of it I don't know
07:45 - anyway I'm gonna go ahead and get
07:47 - started
07:49 - so as the title says I am just trying to
07:53 - finish up the site today so I'm gonna
07:56 - show you here's my Trello board and the
07:59 - link to this is in the description so in
08:00 - case you really do want to check out the
08:03 - board it's it's public also like I did
08:07 - yesterday to start out with if you're
08:09 - interested in seeing my facial
08:11 - expressions as I code and seeing a
08:13 - little bit of what my office looks like
08:15 - you can check me out on on Instagram on
08:19 - my phone I'm live-streaming
08:20 - on Instagram the the view like looking
08:25 - right at my face as I as I code so the
08:31 - link to my Instagram is also in the in
08:34 - the description but as you can see right
08:37 - now I'm working on this JW player so I
08:40 - had changed from a YouTube embed and
08:43 - this was over the weekend I think I
08:45 - changed from a YouTube embed to JW
08:48 - player embed the problem was the normal
08:50 - embed that that's a script tag it loads
08:54 - the first time you load the home page
08:56 - but then after that when you use the
08:59 - client-side routing it doesn't load so
09:03 - there's there's not really anything like
09:05 - I can
09:06 - initialize it and component did mount or
09:08 - anything as far as I know I had thought
09:11 - about maybe trying to do something like
09:13 - that but I found a plugin I'm sorry like
09:21 - a react component for JW player and I
09:25 - set it up I had a little bit of trouble
09:27 - getting the right info but Sebastian is
09:30 - usually in the in the live streams
09:36 - he had mentioned like why don't I just
09:40 - check out the the actual JavaScript file
09:43 - that I was that I was pulling in from
09:47 - the normal embed and if I scroll down to
09:51 - the bottom there was a bunch of info
09:52 - there so using that info and then
09:55 - rereading the documentation on the on
09:58 - the component I was able to get it
10:01 - working the problem is it's not
10:03 - displaying like the full width of the
10:06 - screen like the other one was like I
10:08 - wanted it to so I need to figure out
10:10 - what's going on right now I'm just kind
10:13 - of comparing the CSS for the old layouts
10:17 - doing it in the new way and trying to
10:19 - match it up is exactly is it because I
10:21 - can I thought I had it messed up exactly
10:23 - but it's still not working so I'm gonna
10:25 - give it maybe just one more Pomodoro
10:29 - session and if I can't get it done then
10:32 - I'm gonna go with Plan B which is I'm
10:36 - not gonna use client-side routing for
10:39 - when people go to the home page I really
10:41 - don't want to do that because then I'm
10:43 - losing a lot of the advantages of you
10:46 - know the speed of being able to just do
10:48 - the client-side routing but I don't
10:51 - really have time right now
10:52 - to spend a whole lot of time on this and
10:55 - it it just needs to be done so that's
10:59 - the plan hopefully I can get it working
11:01 - though I really don't want to go with
11:03 - with Plan B and disable that client-side
11:07 - routing and what I mean by that is it's
11:09 - gonna actually refresh the page and so
11:11 - that way the video will play again
11:13 - because it'll have a full page refresh
11:17 - and as you
11:19 - can see I have basically this is it this
11:21 - is all that really needs done and
11:23 - actually everything on this list doesn't
11:25 - absolutely need to be done so some of
11:27 - the things I just really want to get
11:29 - done like we had the geolocation to sort
11:31 - events by distance this was never
11:33 - something that was asked for on the site
11:36 - this was just something that I thought
11:38 - was a really obvious feature that should
11:40 - be on the site so if I can't get to this
11:42 - this art the geolocation already works I
11:44 - just need to have some indication in the
11:47 - user interface that you can do that
11:49 - because right now there's there's no
11:51 - indication at all that you can click on
11:54 - distance and sort by distance so I'm
11:59 - sorry click on location and sort by
12:00 - distance in the same way with the tables
12:04 - you can sort things in the tables by
12:06 - clicking on the table headers but
12:08 - there's no indication that you can do
12:09 - that so right now it's more of like an
12:11 - easter egg on the site so if I need to I
12:15 - can put off some of these probably in a
12:18 - few months I'll be able to come back and
12:20 - work on some of these things again but
12:22 - for now probably have looks like four
12:26 - four and a half Pomodoro sessions
12:29 - according to my estimates that I should
12:32 - be able to get this done so it might
12:34 - take more or less depending on how
12:36 - accurate my estimates are and then
12:38 - that's in addition not including this
12:41 - other Pomodoro session so I'm guessing
12:43 - probably like 6:00 to probably about six
12:46 - sessions that's a 25 minutes a session
12:49 - with some breaks in between that's about
12:52 - three hours since I'll be streaming for
12:55 - a lot of that time I'm gonna say
12:56 - probably four hours of work since I
12:59 - usually have questions and things
13:01 - although if I continue to only have six
13:03 - viewers there probably won't be that
13:06 - many questions so though I could see
13:10 - Alberto is in the stream hey Alberto
13:13 - glad that you could you could join us
13:19 - okay this reminds me when I first
13:21 - started streaming and I would have is
13:23 - actually worse when I first started
13:25 - sometimes I'd be no one watching or just
13:26 - one person watching so maybe I'll get
13:30 - more done since I won't have as much
13:32 - activity in the stream I am a little bit
13:35 - nervous that like some terrible thing
13:37 - happened and everybody's watching the
13:39 - news and I don't know about it but I
13:41 - would think my co-workers would let me
13:45 - know like I'd be getting something my
13:47 - phone would be buzzing and with with
13:50 - news updates I suppose but it is a
13:53 - little weird alright so let's go with
14:00 - this oh I did want to say to my my very
14:03 - first video for free code camp now has
14:06 - over 10,000 views so it's really excited
14:08 - about that I noticed yesterday that it
14:10 - had I hadn't checked the view count in a
14:13 - long time and I noticed that I was I
14:15 - needed less than 50 views to get to
14:17 - 10,000 so I was excited so I kept kept
14:21 - watching it so this morning when I
14:22 - checked it I had I think ten thousand
14:24 - and three views so that was really cool
14:28 - so thanks everyone for for watching and
14:31 - everybody that that viewed it and it has
14:33 - a bunch of thumbs up mostly thumbs up
14:35 - not too many thumbs down so that's
14:38 - really really cool
14:41 - let's let me bring over let me start my
14:47 - my Pomodoro timer so let's pull I'll
14:51 - pull this over here and I guess here's
14:56 - what I'm going to do for right now I'm
14:58 - gonna bring over dev tools for both
15:02 - versions so on on the left hand side
15:06 - this is the new way that I'm embedding
15:09 - using the JW player react component and
15:16 - this is the older way using just this
15:18 - script tag so let me let me know if this
15:23 - font size is too small it looks a bit
15:25 - small but since I'm I don't want to make
15:28 - it too big because I need to be able to
15:30 - see both these things so just let me
15:31 - know I I could probably make it a little
15:33 - bit bigger and it'll still work but
15:36 - really what I want to do is I'm gonna
15:39 - look at this this is the first component
15:43 - that really gets
15:46 - it gets added dynamically alright so
15:50 - that's the one that I want to compare
15:52 - because everything else that's
15:53 - containing it is exactly the same
15:55 - because these are components that I have
15:57 - direct control over so let's look at
16:00 - this top level component I think this is
16:02 - all we'll have to to edit potentially
16:06 - maybe if if I get these exactly the same
16:09 - in terms of their CSS properties and it
16:11 - still doesn't work I'll have to dig down
16:13 - in farther and see that maybe some
16:16 - something down in here you know it looks
16:19 - the same right now actually I may have
16:26 - just figured it out just kind of
16:28 - inadvertently what is this JW aspect
16:37 - JW aspect all right let me check a
16:42 - little bit excited I think I may have
16:44 - just figured this out so let me all
16:47 - right so with height:auto that's what it
16:48 - needs to be let's set this to
16:51 - display:block and we need this padding
16:56 - top
17:04 - we need 50 6.25% oh man
17:11 - that works awesome let me pull this over
17:16 - really quick all right so it worked
17:18 - before I just saw nothing and ice that's
17:23 - really awesome I think I want to I want
17:28 - to see if there are some options for me
17:30 - to take take away this I don't need that
17:32 - in there and let's see what happens ok
17:34 - cool the controls come up great oh man
17:41 - what what good luck the fact I wasn't
17:45 - even gonna dig down in there and check
17:47 - it out but that was it it was the very
17:48 - first thing I looked at ok so I need to
17:53 - probably the best way to do this is just
17:55 - in my in my CSS file I'm just going to
17:59 - add this I'm gonna target this class J
18:03 - to the aspect I just want to make sure
18:04 - really quickly that that same class
18:06 - isn't used I don't see it being used
18:16 - yeah that was good okay so I think if I
18:19 - just started getting this JW aspect
18:20 - class and actually let me just I'm just
18:25 - gonna copy that I'm gonna set it to
18:28 - display:block and then I'm going to add
18:31 - this padding and that should be it that
18:34 - should fix it so I had to comment I hate
18:39 - to use important too often but I I had
18:43 - to override it cuz there's there may be
18:47 - some way for me to change that through
18:49 - the through the react component there
18:53 - probably is some way but at this point
18:56 - you know this is this will work so I'm
19:00 - just gonna go with that and the odds of
19:05 - me actually having to use this component
19:07 - and future projects are really small so
19:10 - I just don't really want to dig that
19:14 - deep into it to learn it later on if I
19:16 - need it then that's fine I'll you know
19:19 - maybe I will dig deeper but for now I
19:22 - don't want to be here all night working
19:26 - on this so let's try it out I'm gonna
19:29 - save that and then I have to do after
19:35 - you hard refresh cuz the hot like reload
19:38 - doesn't work with my stylesheet hey
19:45 - zanna's here hey how's it going
19:53 - did I start early Oh actually you know
19:57 - what I think I did I think I know what I
20:05 - did let me go into my settings really
20:07 - quickly here no I didn't it is right
20:14 - today at 2:00 p.m. I thought that I
20:17 - accidentally set it for 2:00 a.m.
20:19 - instead of 2:00 p.m. but I didn't it it
20:22 - is 2:00 p.m. and I'm pretty sure that I
20:26 - did set it to promote it from one of my
20:31 - channel page for me yeah I did the
20:34 - settings right for a second uh-huh
20:39 - that's odd I did just get a notification
20:41 - on my phone from free code camp because
20:44 - I'm logged in on my personal account on
20:46 - my phone yeah then I didn't get the
20:51 - notification I got was from one of those
20:53 - videos and I did not get a notification
20:57 - about my livestream on my phone that's
21:04 - odd
21:07 - so there's there's actually a decent
21:10 - amount of activity on Twitter of people
21:12 - liking and retweeting the the link that
21:15 - I shared on Twitter for this but hmm oh
21:28 - well I'm not not too worried about it I
21:32 - mean if we get if nobody watches for
21:35 - like a week in a row then maybe I'll
21:37 - worry a little bit but for now I think
21:43 - it's okay
21:54 - okay yeah maybe it's just a weird thing
21:57 - with the notifications I didn't realize
22:00 - that many people relied on the
22:01 - notifications from YouTube so I don't
22:05 - think I can make it notification go out
22:07 - let me check the settings just really
22:10 - quickly broadcast alert yeah all the
22:19 - broadcast alert options are like
22:22 - technical difficulties or delays or
22:24 - something like that so I don't want to
22:27 - send one of those cuz that's not really
22:30 - accurate alright so
22:45 - let's see I'm checking out the live chat
22:49 - quickly Emilia lass is that scrolling
22:55 - effect part of react
22:56 - it is like extra smooth which scrolling
23:00 - effect just the normal scroll or like
23:04 - this this effect if you're talking about
23:09 - this navigation effect this is from it's
23:14 - not part of react this is like a custom
23:22 - it's just a little bit of JavaScript
23:24 - that does that so I think it's in I have
23:30 - Jess yeah this stick the sticky nav
23:37 - function so if you check out the the git
23:39 - repo the link to that's in the
23:42 - description and look in the app j/s file
23:46 - check out the function sticky enough and
23:49 - it's just a modified version of so mark
23:53 - synth did this on code pen and so I just
23:57 - modified it for for this use case and
24:01 - it's it's really short like you can see
24:07 - not very many lines at all and it's a
24:11 - nice effect so but I'm not even sure
24:13 - that you're talking about let's see if
24:20 - Patrick said you that his YouTube
24:22 - notifications have been all screwed up
24:24 - for all the channels for at least a week
24:27 - said the notifications end up being
24:29 - delayed
24:33 - Amelia said got the same notifications
24:36 - so maybe for these some people the
24:38 - notifications are just messed up the
24:45 - scroll okay so Amelia was saying the
24:47 - scroll for this video okay so that was
24:55 - that was what wooden Atia was talking
24:59 - about cool yeah the it's actually a cool
25:02 - effect what happens is there are two
25:06 - knives so this this nav gets cloned so
25:10 - there are actually two completely
25:12 - different elements so the one stays with
25:16 - its normal position and then the other
25:19 - one once you get to a certain point the
25:20 - other one goes with this position would
25:28 - be position fixed so I mean you can
25:30 - check it out there's actually some
25:32 - decent commenting and that's when this
25:37 - is from mark mark self put in the
25:40 - comments and I left them in there so if
25:43 - you've watched me you know I'm not great
25:45 - with commenting I'm gonna try to get
25:47 - better and upcoming projects but it
25:51 - should be pretty pretty easy to work out
25:56 - if you're familiar with jQuery then you
25:59 - should be able to work out what's going
26:00 - on okay
26:03 - so we've added this
26:13 - it wasn't refreshing can anybody guess
26:16 - why it wasn't refreshing it's still my
26:20 - dev server so I tried a little bit to
26:25 - get my dev server to work so I went in
26:28 - and remove like the the files that video
26:33 - all had said to try to remove and that
26:35 - didn't do anything but I didn't go so
26:37 - far as to clone the repo into a
26:39 - different folder just I was just working
26:43 - on other things and that did not work
26:51 - let me see what happened here
26:57 - all right I might have to put some
27:01 - importance in there let's see what
27:06 - happened
27:11 - well yep I just I even need to make this
27:15 - more specific or I'll pray I'll just
27:20 - make it more specific
27:28 - so let's add this in actually that's
27:41 - yeah it's I need to do this okay now go
27:50 - to refresh yeah there we go alright so
27:54 - you can see I refreshed it everything
27:59 - looks good
28:00 - last thing I need to do I mean probably
28:03 - should test it it was it was pretty good
28:07 - last thing I want to do is get rid of
28:10 - this so I'm gonna have to go to the
28:11 - documentation to have up on my other
28:15 - screen so I'll bring it over here and I
28:18 - have it a bit zoomed in I make it a bit
28:24 - smaller so there's a bunch of options so
28:30 - let's see they're probably already an
28:37 - option
28:51 - maybe there's not
28:55 - I figured there would be an option to
28:57 - hide the name of the video maybe run
29:02 - through it again
29:28 - all right yeah so my next idea then is
29:33 - figure out what what part of this
29:40 - controls like what element displays this
29:46 - and then maybe I can just get rid of it
29:49 - with CSS title yes
30:03 - all right so that works so we're just
30:13 - gonna get this JW title and we're gonna
30:16 - set it to display:none I'm gonna do that
30:18 - right in our CSS file so I'm just gonna
30:22 - copy this and get rid of this and I
30:31 - think it was called
30:33 - yeah JW title that was pretty
30:39 - straightforward so I'm going to save
30:41 - that and let's refresh to make sure that
30:45 - it's working all right
30:49 - awesome that works all right so that
30:51 - looks exactly the same as the other one
30:54 - did and if we use our client-side
30:57 - routing it should still work so I've
30:58 - gone to the bout now I'm gonna go back
31:00 - no page refresh and we still have our
31:03 - video awesome and let me check my great
31:09 - so even with me taking a little break to
31:12 - check the live chat that still didn't
31:15 - even take one Pomodoro session so we're
31:20 - ahead of schedule now
31:21 - so that really only took half I can get
31:26 - rid of these great move that's it done
31:33 - all right now let's figure out out of
31:35 - these what what's the most important I'm
31:39 - gonna move these to the bottom this geo
31:41 - locations
31:43 - what else the filters here because you
31:48 - know like I said these were things that
31:49 - I thought would be useful they're not
31:51 - really what what anyone's expecting for
31:57 - the site this can go down here too
32:02 - yeah I think maybe my boss had asked for
32:06 - this a long time ago so this is gonna be
32:10 - easy to put it I'll put this on the
32:11 - bottom I'm not really sure linked to
32:15 - directions yeah I'm not even really sure
32:18 - what I'm supposed to link to I have to
32:21 - go back through my emails and stuff to
32:23 - figure that out so we'll just leave that
32:24 - on the bottom for now too and anything
32:29 - that has like the categories and tags
32:31 - I'm gonna move this down because right
32:35 - now there's definitely not enough enough
32:38 - posts to warrant having categories and
32:41 - tags so if I don't get that in I think
32:45 - it'll be alright because I think even in
32:48 - a few months there's still not really
32:51 - going to be that much on here to warrant
32:53 - this because that you know they have the
32:55 - same staff that's going to be updating
32:57 - this site it's also going to be doing
32:59 - things for the learning management
33:01 - system and that actually did launch on
33:04 - Saturday
33:05 - like it was supposed to I'm assuming I
33:08 - didn't I didn't hear anything to the
33:09 - contrary so that did launch
33:18 - someone else had had joined in the
33:22 - livestream on Instagram so I didn't
33:26 - notice that I want to try to notice when
33:29 - somebody comes in on Instagram just to
33:31 - let them know what's up because
33:33 - otherwise people might not they're just
33:37 - gonna see my face with headphones on and
33:39 - I'm just talking to no one so that might
33:42 - look a little bit weird I'm talking
33:43 - about things they can't see I wish there
33:48 - was a way to like have a message up on
33:50 - the screen on Instagram just so I could
33:52 - let people know like hey I'm doing this
33:54 - live stream on YouTube if you want to
33:57 - see the code but as far as I know
33:58 - there's not a way to do that alright so
34:03 - basically from here down from here down
34:09 - don't have to worry about it
34:12 - all so yeah this is gonna go way at the
34:14 - bottom alright because I think this is
34:17 - another thing that I thought would be
34:19 - useful to have the link in the footer so
34:22 - if it doesn't get down nobody's gonna
34:23 - miss it add image to courses page okay
34:34 - yeah I'll leave that I'm just gonna move
34:38 - it down a bit because all these are go
34:41 - together
34:42 - alright so right now the news page is
34:46 - not there's no link to the news page you
34:48 - would have to type in the URL this would
34:51 - be like khattak addicts column slash
34:52 - news you can get to the news page like
34:54 - that so we're gonna check out the news
34:58 - page right now just to get you an idea
35:01 - of what's what still needs done I'm it
35:06 - looked at it in a little while okay so
35:08 - like is on the list we need to find an
35:11 - image edit the image so that it'll fit
35:14 - in this space I think I need something
35:16 - that's 2,000 pixels wide I can't
35:19 - remember the height off the hook it up
35:20 - so we'll find the image will edit the
35:23 - image we'll put it in here we have
35:26 - already our titles
35:30 - that are getting pulled in and I guess I
35:35 - don't have
35:47 - okay I'll see all right so I had had the
35:50 - idea of making the posts setting it so
35:54 - that you could have a post that only
35:56 - appeared on the home page and didn't
35:58 - show up in the news page and that was
36:00 - because some of these posts only just
36:03 - link somewhere else in the site and they
36:04 - just have a short sentence saying what
36:07 - it does so I didn't think it would even
36:09 - be worth it to have them show up here
36:11 - and then when you click on it it would
36:13 - go you know to a full page like this but
36:18 - then nothing would be displayed or maybe
36:21 - just one sentence now the problem with
36:23 - that is nothing will really show up at
36:31 - all and this was the whole reason we
36:34 - never shared the news page before I'm
36:38 - like I'm a little hesitant to even make
36:39 - this news page live because we still
36:43 - don't have anything here I know there
36:48 - was some content all right we're gonna
36:51 - do the work to get this news page ready
36:54 - but if I can't find some good content to
36:59 - go in here then maybe I'll maybe I'll
37:03 - wait
37:03 - I could always put something in there
37:05 - that would check to see how many posts
37:08 - are available and maybe change this link
37:13 - so that when we do get posts later on
37:15 - it'll automatically change and link to
37:17 - the right page and then that way I don't
37:19 - have to come in and edit it
37:34 - I'm not sure it happened there
37:45 - okay let me
37:56 - I'm going to commit what we did with the
37:58 - with the video use
38:31 - okay all right hey we're up to nine
38:35 - viewers now so we're getting up there
38:42 - it looks like and Tawana is asking it
38:48 - other videos at the beginning the
38:50 - projects and Zanna yes there's a thanks
38:52 - thanks for answering Zanna yeah check
38:55 - out there are also a few videos of the
38:59 - very beginning the project are on my
39:01 - youtube channel in the link to that is
39:03 - it's also in the description for this
39:05 - video on I see Amelia Amelia just
39:10 - answered that as well so once again I
39:16 - forgot to look down and see so thanks
39:19 - Amelia yeah
39:30 - all right so yeah Zanna said it's the
39:34 - feeling when one moves one card to to
39:37 - the done yeah that's a good feeling to
39:39 - move it over to done just look at this
39:42 - doesn't it sleep you get to the end of
39:45 - the project that looks amazing like this
39:48 - is all that's left to do I mean I know I
39:51 - have all this stuff that's like if I had
39:53 - a lot of time I would do this but
39:55 - ignoring this for a minute it's just
39:58 - really cool it feels really good I mean
40:00 - look at all this stuff in the done
40:03 - column just really cool to have all that
40:07 - I mean look that's you know over well
40:10 - over 200 Pomodoro sessions completed
40:13 - really cool that feels great all right
40:16 - well let's just start let's start
40:18 - getting these done so everything that
40:20 - has to do with music it's ticking and
40:22 - yeah are we don't I'm not gonna change
40:24 - that yet and so we have this finished
40:28 - and yeah so we'll do this then we'll
40:33 - move on to this we'll see how much time
40:35 - we have and go from there and let me try
40:44 - to keep accurate estimates of my time so
40:50 - I'm currently closing in on a hundred
40:52 - and fifty hours of development time for
40:55 - this that's a kind of a rough estimate I
40:59 - usually underestimate a bit because that
41:01 - doesn't include any meetings phone calls
41:04 - or emails about this which there were a
41:06 - lot so I think this is gonna end up
41:11 - including all the meetings and
41:13 - everything this is probably going to end
41:14 - up being close to 200 hours of
41:16 - development time for this Patrick asked
41:23 - what Chrome extension I'm using for the
41:25 - Trello thing and I always forget what it
41:29 - is let me look actually is it this one
41:33 - yeah okay so it's scrum for Trello so
41:38 - that's the
41:40 - so that's scrum SCR um Patrick I'm sure
41:45 - you know what scrum is but in case
41:46 - somebody's watching it's not familiar
41:47 - with scrum it SCR um for Trello all
41:55 - right let me get my my timer went off so
41:59 - since there's not a lot going on in the
42:01 - live chat right now although now we're
42:03 - up to eleven viewers so we're getting
42:06 - not nearly as many as we normally have
42:08 - but we're getting there
42:11 - let's see also just a heads up if you
42:15 - see any if if you happen to watch the
42:18 - Instagram thing although no I don't
42:20 - think anyone right now and you see
42:22 - somebody behind me my co-workers were
42:24 - plotting to to get on YouTube or
42:28 - Instagram or something by sneaking in
42:30 - and and looking they're gonna have a
42:32 - hard time though because I did lock my
42:34 - doors so but that was their plot alright
42:38 - so let's start up another Pomodoro
42:41 - session let's grab an image for this I
42:44 - need to find I think I have I don't
42:54 - remember where I have all the images I
42:56 - think they're my Google Drive
43:04 - and actually I did I got an SVG version
43:07 - of the logo as well that if we have time
43:10 - I'm gonna put in there so John Hanson
43:13 - who's often in the live chat converted
43:16 - the the loge of this logo into an SVG
43:20 - right now it's a ping I think so he sent
43:24 - me that and I'm going to while I'm in my
43:30 - Google Drive I'm just gonna download
43:31 - that as well
43:32 - since we might be using it Knox Aven I
43:41 - haven't really even had a chance to
43:42 - check it out yet but I'm a big fan of
43:46 - SVG's whenever I can use them I think it
43:49 - will end up looking that I don't know
43:51 - how it looks on your screen but on my
43:52 - screen this just does not look crisp at
43:54 - all until i if i zoom in like this it
43:57 - looks kind of crisp but it's just it
44:01 - doesn't look great so what did you off
44:06 - to check the file sizes and everything
44:08 - I'm pretty sure the SVG will end up
44:10 - being smaller but we'll we'll check that
44:14 - out in a minute right now I need to find
44:17 - hopefully I can find the so I'll bring
44:23 - it over on this screen when I find it
44:24 - just in case I have a lot of stuff from
44:26 - clients in my drive so I don't want to
44:28 - accidentally show anything from clients
44:30 - that I shouldn't on YouTube
44:37 - that's what my my son always asked if he
44:40 - can like play video games on my
44:42 - computers and stuff when I'm when I'm
44:44 - logged in and I always saw him like you
44:48 - can you can't like you could destroy so
44:50 - many people's websites if you got on my
44:54 - computer so especially I have a lot of
44:57 - things in LastPass so you know he
45:00 - wouldn't necessarily have to know the
45:01 - passwords with LastPass if he could
45:06 - figure out how to fill in everything
45:08 - with like he's only seven so but he got
45:11 - to be careful about that let me see
45:14 - so I think I found the right folder all
45:18 - right I did so let me bring this over
45:21 - and let's check out some of these images
45:25 - all right let me see how can i I'll zoom
45:31 - in a bit so what page this is the news
45:35 - page I'll say right away this image they
45:44 - didn't like this image before the people
45:47 - in charge the catechetical Institute as
45:49 - there's like a header image because I
45:53 - don't know because some of the stuff was
45:56 - out they just didn't like that some
45:57 - things were out of focus on other things
45:58 - weren't out of focus which I don't
46:00 - really know we could do anything about
46:01 - that like obviously you can't have the
46:02 - entire picture in focus if it's you know
46:05 - things are in the background also
46:08 - depending on the screen dimensions some
46:12 - people's you know their heads will get
46:14 - will won't be visible so they didn't
46:16 - like that as well so I think anything
46:18 - with people it's probably out so we just
46:21 - need to look at some of these shots of
46:23 - campus so that limits us to these and
46:29 - some of them have already been used
46:33 - you see also things like this that have
46:36 - an obvious focus they're probably going
46:38 - to be out of the question because once
46:40 - again if part of it gets cut off that
46:42 - they don't like that so like this isn't
46:45 - gonna work
46:46 - say I'm a bit limited
46:55 - actually I wonder about this one I don't
46:58 - think we've used this one
46:59 - let me check quickly see if we've used
47:04 - this one
47:11 - that looks decent I know they really
47:14 - want to use pictures of campus because
47:17 - the people that are going to be using
47:19 - their learning management system will
47:20 - most likely not visit campus so they
47:22 - want to give them a feeling of that this
47:25 - really is attached to a physical campus
47:27 - and not like it online only school
47:30 - that's that's how they explain their
47:33 - desire to have lots of the images of
47:36 - campus Timmy I'm gonna go through
47:39 - quickly and just make sure we're not
47:41 - using how we are using it shoot okay so
47:47 - using that this is different but it
47:51 - really looks the same let me see if we
47:53 - were using this I think we are let's
47:57 - check it out
48:00 - yep we're using that one too maybe not
48:04 - that one but it looks pretty close it's
48:09 - gonna settle think it's the same one no
48:13 - it's not the same one unless there's
48:15 - things getting cut off on the size oh
48:17 - maybe it is the same one yeah okay
48:22 - yeah that is the same one
48:34 - I think we're using this one too let me
48:38 - check the courses events
48:45 - resources to say
49:05 - yep that's it
49:09 - I've already already picked all the ones
49:11 - that'll work
49:12 - let's see this one now I'm using this
49:15 - one alright so that kind of leaves this
49:18 - as being one of the only ones that we
49:21 - haven't used yet I guess I'm really
49:24 - hesitant to use it because in some
49:27 - important parts of the picture are gonna
49:29 - be cut off but I don't really want to
49:35 - spend too much time worrying about this
49:42 - see this one
49:50 - I don't know if I could get a good crop
49:52 - on this so that it would work
50:04 - I guess I might be able to let me
50:08 - alright let's open this in Pixlr and I
50:14 - want to double-check the dimensions that
50:16 - I need
50:37 - oh yeah XANA I am choosing a header
50:40 - sorry I didn't I'm in check over there
50:48 - look Patrick's just got a bunch of
50:51 - YouTube notifications all at once so
50:55 - maybe maybe something was happening
51:06 - Ren's ass how long is this going Ren's a
51:10 - set of five minutes ago so if you're
51:13 - still there ends at least this is
51:16 - probably gonna go till 4:00 maybe later
51:21 - we'll just see how it goes
51:26 - Zanna says she does this in yeah I
51:28 - I actually I do use like for all
51:31 - the the thumbnails for my videos I do
51:35 - those in but it's just it's really
51:38 - convenient for minor things to just open
51:40 - this in the browser and I I don't have
51:42 - to worry about having things downloaded
51:44 - and so this this works for a lot of the
51:47 - stuff that I normally need to do but I
51:51 - do like a light I actually had
51:55 - never used it before and then when I
51:56 - first started streaming for free code
51:58 - camp they they have do their thumbnails
52:03 - in so both sent me both who does
52:07 - the JavaScript video sent me the
52:09 - template file so I had to learn how to
52:12 - use but he was really cool about it
52:14 - he actually he made a tutorial video for
52:16 - me so that I could learn how to edit
52:19 - things in so that was super helpful
52:21 - and it was really nice of him I could
52:24 - even hear like his kids were in the
52:25 - background and stuff so he took time out
52:27 - of his out of this time with his family
52:30 - to do the tutorial so those are really
52:34 - good guy if you get a chance to watch
52:36 - this videos check them out let's see
52:40 - sorry my other screen I'm going through
52:42 - my files trying to find where my there
52:48 - we go
52:50 - where these images are so that I can
52:52 - figure out what I need
52:59 - okay it looks like I need 2,000 by 500
53:07 - yeah
53:09 - all right so 2,000 by 500 what I need so
53:14 - let's adjust the image size
53:19 - okay so we're already at two thousand
53:21 - that's great now we just need to crop
53:25 - 500 out of here foot size okay
53:48 - mmm Wow all right so I guess I'll try to
53:54 - get this this cross this is a cool spot
53:58 - on campus they call it the Rosary circle
54:00 - so they actually have the same number of
54:04 - like bushes around here as there are
54:06 - beads on a rosary so that's kind of cool
54:09 - I had never knew that I had seen this
54:12 - for years and never realized that that's
54:14 - what it was until I started actually
54:18 - started working here but that's what it
54:22 - is that's kind of cool it's easier to
54:27 - tell like from an aerial shot than when
54:29 - you're actually walking around it
54:33 - alright I think that's
54:40 - that'll probably be about what we want
54:44 - all right so let's save this and use
54:55 - title
55:00 - know what an error card
55:03 - come on I don't want to save it's a
55:08 - Google Drive let's try to save it maybe
55:10 - that's why the error occurred that's
55:13 - kind of a really big file I if I have
55:17 - time I need to compress these images
55:21 - there's some other images on the site
55:23 - that I really want to cut down as well
55:43 - all right now let's try this out so
55:47 - where we had news where its title how
55:54 - did I have this
56:17 - I'm not even sure if I'm still using
56:19 - this maybe I am news yeah this was this
56:34 - is kind of a mess I really wanted to be
56:36 - able to just pass this in as a prop but
56:39 - I guess you can't do that if you're
56:41 - using the style JSX so so that's why I
56:48 - have this which seems crazy but it's
56:51 - because I couldn't pass it as a prop and
56:53 - I'm sure if I would have thought about
56:54 - it longer I could have figured out some
56:56 - way to make it work but for now that's
57:02 - that's just how it is let's go back here
57:05 - and see that's really weird why did that
57:11 - happen okay sometimes when I do it just
57:17 - does like a hot reload the styles that
57:21 - are in the dish style JSX tags don't get
57:24 - applied let's go back to our news page
57:33 - yeah
57:37 - so maybe it's not that's not where
57:48 - hmm
57:56 - then I'm not change the right spot let's
58:00 - see
58:03 - all right so yeah this is entitle the
58:06 - title component and C News News title
58:11 - okay oh I know what I didn't put it in
58:17 - the new folder I put it right in the
58:18 - image folder mm-hm
58:26 - still not working
58:46 - let's make sure that this is actually
58:48 - called news
58:56 - maybe I didn't put in news
59:10 - okay yes I've given the ID courses here
59:13 - to Maine so maybe I just didn't do that
59:14 - for news yet
59:25 - there we go all right great okay so we
59:29 - have that section all right as I move
59:33 - that around that's not bad I mean this
59:37 - no one's gonna have a screen like this
59:40 - I'm not worried about it but let's maybe
59:43 - see how it looks on this screen okay
59:47 - that's I can I can live with that
59:50 - so on most screen dimensions you can see
59:54 - you can still see the cross there I
59:56 - think they'll be happy with that awesome
60:04 - so yeah that definitely took longer than
60:08 - I hoped it took a bit longer than the
60:13 - one half but some let's go ahead and
60:17 - commit commit to change
60:35 - my livestream on Instagram stopped so I
60:40 - did it yesterday I think Instagram has a
60:42 - one hour time limit it seems like
60:44 - because I've been streaming for one hour
60:46 - so good to know and yesterday I didn't
60:53 - realize you could do this but you can
60:56 - make your livestream available for 24
60:58 - hours so I did do that so in case
61:00 - anybody does want to see it it's
61:03 - available it will be available for the
61:06 - next 24 hours so I'm trying to find my
61:11 - there it is my console
61:19 - whoa you sir okay that's our new file
61:24 - great
61:54 - all right great so that's done I'm gonna
61:59 - say I'm gonna just round this up and say
62:04 - that this did take one it almost took
62:12 - one
62:16 - or maybe yeah I didn't do a whole lot of
62:21 - looking at the live chat so I could
62:23 - could knock some time off for that but I
62:25 - think that took about one alright let's
62:28 - make news page alright so basically for
62:32 - this one I just want to clean up the
62:34 - page a little bit display what needs to
62:36 - be displayed this is no longer on hold
62:47 - let's see I want to briefly look through
62:56 - some of my I can't find it I had open my
63:05 - oh there we go my messages from my boss
63:10 - just to get through really quickly and
63:13 - see if the information that I needed was
63:22 - there no I don't think it is
63:30 - all right so I guess I could check my
63:34 - email quickly too if you remember I said
63:37 - there there was some extra information
63:38 - that could go here for some new posts so
63:52 - I want to find that but it's it's been a
63:54 - while
64:15 - yeah oh well it's not a big deal
64:19 - you know anyone could enter in that
64:22 - information from WordPress now it'll all
64:24 - get pulled in it's a wordpress so
64:26 - that'll be fun let's see we do need to
64:33 - check these out we need to edit these
64:36 - pages a bit I don't want the title to
64:40 - appear like this because if if you get a
64:43 - long title for a post it looks really
64:46 - weird and it extends out so it's just
64:48 - we're gonna change up how this the
64:51 - single news page works but for now I
64:59 - want to check out why I'm not getting
65:02 - the excerpt to display here and I guess
65:09 - it's not we don't really need it a
65:15 - hundred percent but usually that's
65:17 - something that's kind of expected
65:40 - all right so let's see what we're doing
65:42 - here
65:51 - okay so we're not we're not sending the
65:53 - excerpt in and let's see what it looks
66:00 - like on and WordPress
66:17 - all right so this is all the information
66:18 - I'm getting I'm putting in there in
66:21 - WordPress
66:41 - okay so this explains why we have no
66:44 - content because right now all we have is
66:50 - the excerpt and we have nothing in the
66:55 - actual content we also have no
67:03 - categories yet
67:12 - see
67:25 - which I think of the best thing to do
67:44 - okay let's see I'm gonna do my my short
67:48 - break here and check the live chat
67:53 - that'll give me a minute to think about
67:55 - what I want to do with this I'm gonna
68:04 - record what I did on my other screen
68:07 - here
68:20 - all right so I'm go back to the live
68:23 - chat Wow still only nine viewers
68:29 - yeah it must maybe it didn't alert
68:32 - people
68:52 - haha yeah you get Patrick must have
68:54 - heard the Bell the three o'clock Bell
68:57 - for for prayer time
69:12 - okay Umberto says that he never received
69:14 - an alert either hmm that must have been
69:20 - the problem then for some reason the
69:23 - alert did not go out that this would be
69:26 - this would be live so oh well I'm gonna
69:34 - double-check one more time let's see
69:36 - promotion promote on my channel page
69:47 - hmm
70:00 - yeah yeah all the settings are the same
70:03 - as I normally do
70:31 - mm-hmm okay so Joseph said he didn't get
70:36 - an alert either Umberto said looking at
70:39 - the alert option for this channel it
70:41 - looks like he got reset to off that's
70:43 - odd
70:45 - did get the alert okay so when I did I
70:48 - did do a stream earlier on my own my own
70:51 - channel and Joseph said he did get that
70:56 - alert okay that must be it then not
71:05 - really sure what I can do about that
71:07 - maybe later on I could try to look it up
71:12 - see if that's happened to anyone else
71:15 - before so I'm not if it if it keeps
71:21 - happening then I'll be a little bit more
71:24 - worried about it but I guess it'll be
71:26 - not that worried if it just happens the
71:29 - one time
71:40 - okay let's sum so yes there's not
71:45 - there's not that much going on in the
71:46 - live chat so I don't I'll be right on
71:49 - time usually I always go over my
71:54 - allotted time for checking the live chat
71:57 - at this time I don't think I will
72:13 - okay
72:39 - I think I probably will try to end this
72:43 - stream at like 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time at
72:49 - the latest because my the head of my
72:52 - department did want to kind of just meet
72:56 - and have me give her like a recap of
72:58 - what I did with this site so I want to
73:04 - make sure I finish up the stream before
73:05 - she for she wants to do that so she
73:08 - actually she might be stopping by my
73:10 - office in a little bit for that so just
73:14 - to let you all know probably would be at
73:17 - most two hour stream all right so my
73:23 - thoughts were basically it doesn't even
73:28 - make sense to have these right now be
73:31 - late
73:33 - you know cuz right now you know the the
73:39 - point of these is just to be basically
73:46 - links with with a little bit of text to
73:52 - you know right here so they're not even
73:57 - really meant meant to be like blog post
74:09 - oh I just had an idea
74:15 - all right here's what I'm thinking so
74:18 - right now these link to other places
74:23 - mostly I think within the site some of
74:27 - them to external places so what if when
74:34 - this option was checked
74:46 - if this is check that it's supposed to
74:49 - appear on a home page only then instead
74:59 - of only appearing on the home page it
75:01 - could also appear here but when you
75:02 - click the link it would go to the place
75:04 - would that be too confusing since this
75:07 - is apparently a blog page
75:25 - I don't know maybe I shouldn't so my
75:27 - original thought was that if something
75:30 - was basically not really a blog post it
75:32 - was just meant to link somewhere and
75:34 - then this would be checked and it would
75:35 - only show up on the home page and not
75:36 - back here the problem then is that right
75:39 - now we only have things like that we
75:41 - don't have any legitimate posts
76:01 - yeah I think I'll just go with that so
76:03 - here's what's gonna here's what I'm
76:04 - gonna do
76:05 - I'll check the live chat in a second to
76:07 - see if anyone is kind of has any opinion
76:11 - on this but what I'm gonna do is at
76:15 - least for now I'm just gonna put some
76:18 - test data in here just to see how this
76:21 - looks and if it looked okay I'm gonna
76:24 - just have it so that if it's checked if
76:28 - this box is checked for homepage only it
76:31 - won't show up here and they'll just have
76:36 - to put in you know put in things that'll
76:39 - show up at some point all right so let's
76:46 - go into yeah we'll do it we'll go to the
76:50 - news page and let's see if those content
76:57 - render it let's go so we have this is
77:05 - okay
77:16 - see how do I have this listed excerpt I
77:22 - think I'm going to grab this excerpt and
77:25 - make it what appears here below below
77:31 - this date so there's just a very short
77:34 - description
77:43 - so I need to pull in
78:03 - I think that's probably what it is find
78:07 - out in a second
78:54 - okay
79:02 - all right it's not bad
79:06 - that's pretty good I'm not sure about
79:09 - the dates I don't know what do you think
79:15 - about how the date looks to me at Denise
79:19 - I need to do something with it
79:39 - alright I'm gonna check the live chat
79:41 - quickly see what you all think
80:19 - okay all right so
80:29 - looks like looks like some people are
80:31 - saying if I don't have any content leave
80:33 - these in or potentially I could just put
80:36 - in some message saying there's no
80:37 - content if there's nothing I think I'll
80:40 - end up doing that saying there's no
80:41 - content just because I think that's
80:45 - going to be easier than trying to change
80:47 - with these link - I don't know maybe
80:52 - about the same but I just kind of don't
80:53 - want I don't want to make it so these
80:58 - link to internal pages I want to keep
81:02 - this as like a normal blog would
81:06 - function oops
81:32 - oh cool yeah Patrick just like this
81:37 - Patrick made some fireworks
81:39 - Foofa which a lot really cool I like
81:44 - that that looks really cool I'm gonna
81:48 - show my kids that they will love that I
81:54 - feel like I could spent so much time
81:56 - just watching that I need to like I need
82:02 - to minimize that quickly before I get
82:04 - any more distracted thanks for sharing
82:06 - that Patrick that was cool
82:17 - okay Umberto's says with the date-style
82:20 - thinking maybe like a lower color loaf
82:26 - yeah maybe yeah let's just let's open up
82:31 - dev tools here and just play around a
82:33 - little bit see what how we can give it a
82:35 - look
82:53 - hmm
82:56 - Oh
82:59 - see
83:25 - okay I could do the gold color and see
83:29 - how that looks
83:30 - I think this does need some padding
84:06 - what is going on
84:33 - ha letting me to look at the live shed I
84:37 - know you all caught what I was doing and
84:41 - now I feel like an idiot because I can't
84:48 - tell right from left
85:44 - all right
85:46 - I think that looks a little better
85:56 - you seem like here that this extends
86:00 - beyond you know where the title is so I
86:03 - wanted to line those up
86:07 - all right I'm I'm satisfied with that I
86:12 - think this is one of those things right
86:14 - I could spend a long time like changing
86:17 - one pixel here and there but I don't I
86:22 - don't know that it would be worth it
86:24 - so let's use this
86:34 - this was a spin
86:54 - I think I can actually just say span I
86:58 - don't have any other spans here and for
87:06 - some reason things that I pull in from
87:12 - the API that the styles that are in here
87:16 - don't get applied to that or at least
87:24 - they haven't been making they're
87:26 - supposed to and I'm doing something
87:27 - wrong
87:33 - oops
87:43 - all right let's see if that works yep
87:47 - great
87:50 - all right so that works
87:57 - now let's take a look at this interior
88:00 - page
88:10 - and let me before I commit this I'm
88:12 - gonna look at the live chat just in case
88:14 - I missed something
88:31 - okay Santa's and give something like
88:35 - read more yeah we could have something a
88:40 - little link that says read more made
88:43 - throughout
88:51 - we could have that I am I don't know
88:56 - what do you think do you think I should
88:57 - have that is that necessary throughout
88:59 - the site anytime that there's text in
89:01 - red it's a link so I mean we do have at
89:11 - least a pattern of things in in red
89:14 - being links I don't let me know what you
89:18 - think if if I really should put a read
89:20 - more link you know here that people can
89:25 - click on
90:01 - okay
90:04 - all right so
90:10 - all right so maybe I should put in a
90:13 - read more link all right let's do that
90:15 - let's put a read more link in and so
90:20 - that would be
90:33 - because here we'll put a span and now
90:38 - I'm gonna have to do
90:47 - maybe I'll just I'll leave this a span
90:50 - or I have the same styling as the date
90:56 - let me see
91:13 - because for now I think that'll be okay
91:25 - so I am gonna make this a link but for
91:28 - now I just want to see what it looks
91:29 - like
92:12 - hmm
92:22 - so definitely have to
92:49 - let's see
93:29 - all right see Alex
93:38 - all right that's not bad what do you
93:41 - think
93:53 - whoa saying there are two live streams
93:55 - now for free code camp yeah I've never
93:59 - seen that before either let me check
94:02 - that out
94:43 - okay it looks like from the channel it
94:46 - looks like that though isn't live but he
94:49 - did put a video up
94:58 - yeah an hour ago okay
95:11 - okay so it was just delayed okay cool
95:20 - hey John how's it going glad you could
95:23 - join us and thanks for that SVG I'm
95:28 - gonna try to get that in if I can if I
95:31 - have time today I really appreciate that
95:41 - Blake thanks for watching I'm not sure
95:45 - that I've seen you in the live chat
95:48 - before if I if you have been in the live
95:51 - chat and I just didn't remember I'm
95:52 - sorry about that but otherwise welcome
95:55 - and thanks for joining in okay so it
96:02 - seems like the consensus is that the
96:03 - read more looks good so let's actually
96:05 - make it a link now so we can just grab
96:12 - this
96:20 - let's see
96:34 - all right let's see how that up and I
96:37 - turned it blue it's very very sad
96:56 - area
96:59 - okay so that's cool resources yep so
97:05 - that's working how we wanted to alright
97:07 - great so that looks good now now I can
97:11 - commit
97:46 - okay
97:56 - all right and our Pomodoro session is
98:00 - almost up and let's see single news page
98:12 - that was what we're gonna move on to let
98:15 - me add on let's see alright so I mean
98:28 - we've we have actually completed this
98:33 - according to what this task was but I'm
98:40 - just gonna lump in the changing that
98:44 - single news page as well I don't want
98:46 - them don't want to make another card I
98:48 - have some time left in my estimate so
98:51 - it's possible that I just have assumed I
98:53 - was gonna do that as part of this before
98:55 - I made this so long ago I really can't
98:58 - looks like I added this card to ready
99:02 - for development on May 10 so I do know
99:04 - how long ago I actually made the card
99:08 - let's see a short break alright I think
99:12 - actually so think I'm actually I'm gonna
99:17 - go to the live chat answer some
99:19 - questions and then probably I'm gonna
99:24 - finish up then so I don't really want to
99:26 - start another Pomodoro cycle and another
99:29 - thing because then that'll put me over
99:32 - the the two-hour mark for this video so
99:36 - I do want to leave time to to wrap wrap
99:41 - up what I'm doing and then meet with my
99:46 - department head and give an overview of
99:50 - what all was done and I think I just got
99:54 - a text from my wife a few minutes ago
99:56 - that
99:59 - she has to do something at 4:30 yeah so
100:04 - I've never I'm gonna answer some
100:06 - questions and wrap it up and then call
100:09 - my wife to figure out if if that if the
100:13 - text she just sent me means that I need
100:14 - to be home very soon or what so I'm not
100:19 - sure with them he's but yeah let me
100:22 - check in the live chat here and see if
100:24 - I've missed anything I know there's not
100:25 - a whole lot of people here I'm like
100:30 - somewhat afraid that everybody's going
100:32 - to get a delayed notification for this
100:34 - and right when I'm about to end the
100:37 - stream
100:37 - you know everybody will join in at that
100:39 - point because they will have just gotten
100:40 - the notification so I kind of hope that
100:43 - doesn't happen I'd hate to bail on
100:47 - everybody right away all right so let me
100:53 - let's see what's in the chat here
101:11 - okay Susanna mentioned the read more
101:14 - link could actually make the the text
101:18 - like drop down and it just pushes
101:20 - everything else down but it would no
101:22 - longer up in a new post so I do I like
101:25 - Patrick says he likes that idea as well
101:28 - but so right now what will end up
101:34 - happening is that assuming that the
101:41 - people put inputting data follow what
101:43 - the instructions I'm gonna give them so
101:45 - I'm gonna make them a video to go
101:47 - through all of this you know how to how
101:50 - to update all content in WordPress and
101:52 - how it will look I am gonna say you know
101:55 - make sure if you don't have a lot of
101:57 - content you check the box so that it
101:59 - won't appear on the the news page and
102:06 - that way I will avoid having a page
102:10 - that's just mostly blank but I do want I
102:14 - like the idea of the accordion except I
102:17 - want people to be able to link directly
102:19 - to a blog post so especially like to
102:25 - share it on social media or something
102:26 - and for that it needs to have its own
102:29 - page I mean potentially it could do like
102:32 - some sort of like hash at the end of the
102:34 - URL but but then you know you still
102:37 - wouldn't get the data being pulled into
102:40 - social media properly so I think it
102:43 - should have its own page and just
102:46 - hopefully they take my advice and only
102:50 - make a full page you know post
102:57 - I'm gonna recommend that every like
103:00 - legitimate blog post needs to have at
103:02 - least 300 words that's usually when I
103:07 - use I used to do a lot of search engine
103:09 - optimization like copywriting and so
103:12 - like ghost blogging and things for
103:13 - companies and I always said like every
103:17 - post needs to be at least 300 words I
103:19 - didn't want it to appear to be like
103:20 - shallow content so that's that's what
103:24 - I'm gonna recommend okay I see as Anna
103:33 - says if it's a longer post it could open
103:35 - a new post so it could be either or I
103:38 - yeah I do like that idea I'm probably
103:40 - not gonna do it just because at this
103:41 - point I'm running out of time
103:44 - so I'll probably just keep it as is for
103:46 - now
104:06 - okay so food says awesome work Jessie
104:10 - thanks I appreciate that and thanks for
104:14 - joining in the the live chat thanks for
104:16 - watching
104:19 - Blake s what's the link for the timer
104:23 - it's just tomato timer comm see if I can
104:31 - yeah so tomato timer com tomato - timer
104:35 - comm yeah no problem
104:45 - pooch says what advice would you give to
104:48 - someone who's learning wordpress along
104:50 - with code yeah that's actually kind of
104:55 - how I learned I would say this
105:03 - definitely seems to be like a wordpress
105:05 - way of doing things and that's I mean in
105:08 - terms of they have like these these
105:11 - hooks and everything is done through
105:13 - that so in terms of like how you write
105:15 - PHP I guess just be aware that the
105:18 - WordPress way of doing it isn't you know
105:21 - that's specific to WordPress and that
105:23 - isn't used everywhere so just kind of be
105:25 - aware of that and then I would you know
105:28 - when you can do projects that don't
105:30 - involve WordPress you know try that
105:32 - because there's a lot of things that
105:34 - WordPress does for you that if you're
105:37 - gonna do a project from scratch you know
105:40 - you need to worry about so things like
105:41 - like routing WordPress does that for you
105:45 - but you know normally if you're doing a
105:47 - project just from scratch with just
105:49 - JavaScript you'd have to come up with
105:51 - some sort of routing system like
105:54 - templating so there's just so many
105:56 - built-in things with WordPress that if
105:58 - you only stuck with WordPress you
105:59 - wouldn't even realize what goes into
106:01 - that or how to do that so that would be
106:05 - my advice is I think WordPress is great
106:08 - it lets you build nice-looking really
106:13 - nice-looking sites you know really
106:14 - functional sites without having to worry
106:17 - so much about all
106:18 - other stuff and without really having to
106:20 - know about back-end things but if if you
106:24 - really want to kind of learn how
106:25 - everything works then I would try to do
106:27 - some things not in WordPress and it'll
106:32 - just give you a much better idea of what
106:34 - goes in and you will you'll actually
106:36 - appreciate everything that WordPress
106:37 - does for you so that's that's kind of my
106:42 - my advice and also like learn how to use
106:45 - some of the build tools that you would
106:47 - use normally on a JavaScript project
106:49 - that you wouldn't normally use with
106:51 - WordPress so I'm talking about like you
106:56 - know using let's say like gulp or web
107:00 - pack or something
107:02 - all from the you know learning how to
107:04 - use the command line using git I think
107:07 - those sort of things are they're not
107:09 - used as commonly with WordPress because
107:12 - you don't you can start up a wordpress
107:15 - site without that and you can work on it
107:17 - without it so it's not quite as common
107:20 - but I think those are important things
107:21 - to know so that would be my advice
107:24 - hopefully that helped a bit
107:34 - okay so John actually said it was a very
107:37 - delayed notification you know I'm gonna
107:40 - have to really be more disciplined about
107:43 - scheduling the time for the video
107:45 - earlier in the day usually what I what
107:49 - I've done is like I just put it off
107:52 - until later on and then that gives me a
107:54 - better idea of what I'm actually going
107:55 - to be working on so I can I can write a
107:58 - better description for the video but I
108:00 - think maybe it would be better to maybe
108:05 - my my titles and descriptions aren't
108:07 - quite accurate but if I were to let's
108:10 - say it like you know maybe 9:00 9:00
108:14 - a.m. you know Eastern Time or 10 I would
108:18 - have the video already scheduled and it
108:20 - would already be notifying maybe maybe
108:23 - then there'd be a better chance of the
108:25 - notifications coming maybe when I wait
108:27 - till the last minute it's just you know
108:30 - that's causing the delay I don't really
108:33 - know I mean you would think that you
108:34 - could start the stream you know and then
108:36 - a minute later the notification would go
108:38 - out but maybe that's it so I'm gonna
108:40 - make a better effort to not wait until
108:44 - the last minute get the stream schedule
108:47 - and then because I usually know like as
108:52 - soon as I get into work I have a decent
108:54 - idea of whether or not I'll be able to
108:56 - stream at the proper time you know 2
108:58 - p.m. Eastern so I should be able to
109:00 - schedule and if I have to change it
109:03 - later on that I do change it but maybe
109:07 - that will help
109:15 - okay so Patrick says that he thinks that
109:18 - the 300 word count for search engine
109:20 - optimization is outdated and it's
109:22 - actually longer now okay that's good to
109:24 - know
109:25 - okay Zanna says like 500 words maybe
109:28 - I'll recommend 500 then I think to
109:32 - recommend I'll go ahead and recommend
109:36 - about 500 I was just thinking I don't
109:42 - want to make it too daunting of a task
109:44 - for them but then on second thought I I
109:47 - thought you know throughout this entire
109:49 - process for the site I kept on saying it
109:52 - would be better if we had less text so I
109:55 - kind of think it's not really gonna be a
109:58 - problem for them to hit that 500 word
109:59 - count since they seem to be going over
110:03 - the amount of text that I that I think
110:07 - they should have in most of the other
110:08 - parts of the site so thanks for that
110:11 - I'll go with 500 words I haven't done
110:13 - like real SEO work in so long and that
110:16 - feel it changes so often that I don't
110:19 - really feel confident that I'm up on the
110:21 - latest things I'm sure there's probably
110:23 - some fundamental things that pretty much
110:25 - stay the same and I'd be good with that
110:27 - but I wouldn't I wouldn't say that I'm
110:30 - nearly as knowledgeable about current
110:34 - trends and SEO as I used to be used to
110:37 - be I used to be able to get sites to the
110:39 - you know right to the top of the first
110:42 - page and in small markets
110:45 - you know usually within you know within
110:49 - months I could I could for sure get him
110:51 - up I had like I had like a plan and if
110:56 - you just stuck to the plan you know it
110:59 - seemed like it always worked
111:00 - like I said in small markets not in like
111:03 - high competition places but usually like
111:09 - when that starts happening and you can
111:11 - continually consistently get sites
111:13 - ranked higher with the formula then
111:15 - things change the algorithms changed and
111:18 - I wasn't like spamming bad content my my
111:22 - philosophy and
111:24 - when copywriting was always yes you want
111:27 - to do it so you can get ranked higher
111:29 - but I always wanted to give users
111:31 - something useful to them and meaningful
111:34 - even if my main purpose in writing is
111:37 - just to get you know more to get rank
111:42 - higher and the search engine rankings
111:44 - then I still wanted to provide some
111:47 - benefit so I think that's really what
111:49 - it's about is if you provide something
111:52 - beneficial and substantial consistently
111:55 - then eventually you will rank higher as
111:58 - long as you're doing the fundamental
111:59 - things like you know you have your HTML
112:00 - formatted properly and things like that
112:02 - title tags title tags always found to be
112:06 - really important I assume they're still
112:09 - important
112:17 - all right Gaurav says looks good man
112:19 - thanks thanks I appreciate that
112:29 - yeah then I said I hope they won't ask
112:32 - you to write their content - yeah it
112:34 - definitely won't be I don't write
112:36 - content anymore I'm not really it's I'm
112:39 - not into that so I I do not offer that
112:43 - service to clients anymore yeah so
112:49 - there's a dimension since they expect
112:51 - design tests from you yeah I still I do
112:53 - design and that's out of necessity
112:55 - because there's no one else that can do
112:57 - design but we have we have we actually
112:59 - have writers on staff in my department
113:01 - so since we have writers we have graphic
113:06 - designers but they just stick with print
113:07 - stuff mostly so and we have writers but
113:13 - we don't have a web designer so I end up
113:17 - doing the web design as well
113:28 - yeah John says it's hard to convince
113:30 - people to have good and relevant tax
113:32 - count on websites everyone wants to go
113:34 - for the minimalist white-on-white look
113:36 - yeah I mean I like minimalist in general
113:41 - but I do you you need to have a certain
113:46 - word count I think on on a page but
113:50 - there were some pages where I kept I
113:53 - wanted to keep a large font size so I'm
113:56 - convinced that the one of the keys to
113:59 - having people actually read your content
114:01 - is to have a decent sized font so like
114:05 - I'm not really comfortable going below
114:07 - like 18 pixels for most font sizes
114:11 - because it's just hard to read I mean it
114:16 - really it depends on your screen and how
114:18 - far away you are from your screen
114:19 - different things like that but basically
114:20 - like I'm way less likely to read
114:24 - something if the font is small and I
114:26 - have to like really focus on it and I
114:29 - have I have good vision I've good
114:31 - eyesight you know I'm young so I can
114:34 - imagine people who have difficult you
114:36 - know they don't have good vision or
114:37 - they're older like it's got to be
114:39 - terrible for them to try to read this
114:40 - small font so having said that if you're
114:44 - gonna go with a large font you have to
114:47 - cut down the amount of text otherwise it
114:49 - just seems like an overwhelming amount
114:51 - of text because you have this large font
114:54 - size now so I like to increase font size
114:56 - decrease the amount of text and then
114:58 - it'll be easier for people to read and
115:00 - there'll be less that they have to read
115:02 - so it's more likely that they'll read a
115:04 - higher percentage of the content on
115:07 - every page so I think that's my
115:11 - philosophy on things maybe I may be
115:16 - mistaken but
115:23 - see
115:29 - all right cool yeah so John mentioned
115:35 - the Meta Description tag is ignored by
115:38 - search engine yeah so if you're still
115:41 - using the Meta Description tag on your
115:42 - site just stop it's not used by search
115:47 - engines well I shouldn't say stop here's
115:53 - my feeling that Meta Description tag if
115:55 - you don't use it a search engine will
115:58 - just pull content from your site anyway
116:00 - and it'll probably be relevant and it'll
116:02 - match up with whatever the search term
116:04 - was so you can add it if you really want
116:09 - to specify what the description would be
116:12 - but it's totally not necessary so I
116:17 - guess it just depends on what you want
116:19 - I've gone back and forth on it sometimes
116:21 - depending on whether you know depending
116:24 - on what I want so if you have a certain
116:27 - like marketing message that you really
116:29 - want to appear then I guess you use use
116:31 - it otherwise like don't worry as much
116:34 - about it because the search engine will
116:37 - pull what they want
116:47 - yeah Johnson yeah thanks for clarifying
116:51 - yeah I didn't mean let me clarify that
116:55 - because I don't mean so John is rightly
116:58 - bringing up that it's the the meta or
117:02 - the keywords so like the meta keywords
117:04 - are not crawled like so those won't be
117:07 - called the description will they'll see
117:10 - the description another use of
117:11 - description but it won't count in terms
117:13 - of your your ranking so it's it's not
117:20 - like it's invisible to search engines
117:24 - but it won't like don't keywords stuff
117:27 - your description right because that's
117:29 - not going to do anything for you in
117:31 - terms of search ranking right your
117:33 - description in a way that's going to
117:35 - appeal to your users okay don't don't
117:38 - consider search engines when you're
117:40 - doing your description does that make
117:43 - more sense
117:43 - I probably shouldn't talk about SEO at
117:48 - all anyway since I'm not I'm not really
117:51 - up on it so like I said I haven't done
117:55 - anything with search engine optimization
117:57 - in probably two years so don't don't
118:01 - take what I say as as accurate anymore
118:14 - but I think it's it's been true for a
118:17 - long time so it's true to say don't use
118:20 - meta keywords if you do use the Meta
118:25 - Description write it to your users don't
118:28 - worry about search engines because they
118:30 - won't use that as a ranking factor the
118:35 - title tag is important to have the
118:40 - proper wording in because at least it's
118:44 - been my experience that the title tag is
118:46 - actually very important in terms of what
118:49 - keywords you actually rank for and your
118:52 - header tags alright so I'm not I'm not
119:03 - gonna comment any more on on search
119:05 - engine optimization because I I think
119:08 - saying less is better at this point
119:09 - because I don't want to mess any one
119:11 - site up by giving incorrect advice on on
119:15 - that but I'm thinking I'm gonna I'm
119:20 - gonna wrap up this stream thanks for
119:24 - watching like I said I'm gonna try to
119:28 - schedule the streams earlier so you all
119:30 - can get hopefully get the notifications
119:33 - on time and not late so I apologize for
119:38 - that I hadn't anticipated that that
119:40 - would happen I'm not entirely sure why
119:43 - it happened but just in case it was
119:46 - because of the timing of me starting
119:50 - scheduling the stream I'll try to do it
119:52 - earlier so tomorrow I will be back with
119:57 - an entirely new project I'm not exactly
119:59 - sure what it'll be but it'll be new so
120:03 - thank you so much to everyone who helped
120:05 - out with this project I think it turned
120:07 - out really well and way better with your
120:10 - help than it ever could have been with
120:12 - just me working on it I really
120:14 - appreciate that and yeah I think that's
120:22 - that's it for today's stream see
120:24 - tomorrow and have a great day
