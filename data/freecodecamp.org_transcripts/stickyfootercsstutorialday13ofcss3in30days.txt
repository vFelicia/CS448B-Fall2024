00:00 - hey everyone welcome back to day number
00:01 - 13 of css3 in 30 days today we're going
00:04 - to be building a css sticky footer now
00:07 - what is a sticky footer well a sticky
00:09 - footer is a footer on your web page that
00:11 - sticks to the bottom of your viewport
00:13 - regardless of the content size
00:16 - within the page so for example if you
00:19 - have a
00:20 - page layout and you only have one
00:23 - sentence and then you have your footer
00:25 - let's call it a colored footer
00:27 - it's not going to stay at the bottom of
00:29 - the viewport of your browser
00:32 - that's because it collapses up into the
00:34 - end of the content so your footer is
00:37 - actually a quarter of the way down the
00:39 - page and you got all this white space
00:40 - below it it looks pretty bad now the
00:44 - what
00:47 - now a sticky footer makes that footer
00:49 - actually go to the bottom of the browser
00:51 - viewport even if the content is way up
00:54 - here so let me show you what that looks
00:55 - like over here i have in the number 13
00:59 - sticky footer project files go ahead and
01:01 - download that there's a number of
01:02 - different files in this one it's a
01:04 - little bit different than what we
01:06 - have normally been doing i'll show you
01:08 - what that looks like here so we have
01:10 - index.html
01:12 - final.html student.html and we also have
01:16 - final and sandbox.css
01:19 - now what why do i have that the
01:21 - index.html page is the info page it's
01:23 - just
01:24 - instructions on what you're going to be
01:26 - building and why you're going to be
01:27 - building it and then a couple of buttons
01:29 - that allow you to go to the student
01:30 - version and the final version so
01:33 - the info page is just your instructions
01:35 - and then
01:37 - access to these buttons so if i go to
01:38 - the student version this is the
01:42 - the sandbox the student version with the
01:44 - sticky footer down here that you need to
01:46 - make sticky now this is an example of a
01:48 - non-sticky footer the content of this
01:51 - page here as you can see
01:53 - it is pretty short and the bottom of the
01:56 - viewport is way down here
01:58 - and this footer is there so it's not
02:00 - actually
02:01 - it doesn't actually look like a footer
02:03 - it's just another element below
02:06 - this content now we want to make this
02:08 - footer stick to the bottom of the
02:09 - viewport like the final version right
02:11 - here
02:12 - now if i were to resize this browser
02:14 - window
02:16 - that footer follows along as you can see
02:18 - there
02:19 - follows where i drag and then it stops
02:23 - at this here and then there's a scroll
02:26 - so that is a sticky footer
02:29 - and then the student version you can see
02:31 - is non-sticky
02:33 - so
02:34 - it's actually quite easy to make this it
02:36 - involves very minimal markup and just
02:39 - some css trickery
02:41 - so
02:42 - let's go ahead jump into our our code
02:44 - editor here and let's get started
02:48 - so
02:49 - you don't really need to concern
02:50 - yourself with index.html it doesn't
02:52 - really matter so it is final.html
02:56 - if you want to see the final version
03:00 - you can see here if i scroll down
03:02 - we have a few things that you need to
03:04 - note there's a div here that wraps
03:06 - everything
03:08 - in
03:09 - with the class called page content
03:11 - now below that page content it's not
03:14 - within it is footer and that contains a
03:17 - div as well all of these elements are
03:19 - important
03:21 - now if i go to your
03:23 - student.html it's the same markup we got
03:26 - page content
03:28 - and then outside of that we have a
03:30 - footer with a div inside of it
03:33 - now if we go to our sandbox.css let's
03:36 - get started with our styling of this
03:38 - sticky footer the first thing that you
03:40 - need to always do is start off with the
03:43 - html and body select the two of those
03:45 - we're going to give it a height of 100
03:47 - percent
03:49 - and a margin of zero so we want to clean
03:51 - that up make sure that the html and body
03:53 - have a height of 100 of the viewport and
03:55 - a margin of zero so it doesn't mess with
03:57 - our calculations
03:59 - now we're going to select that page
04:01 - content class
04:04 - that we saw right here
04:08 - and in there we're going to say minimum
04:10 - height or min height rather
04:12 - of 100
04:14 - that forces it to have a minimum height
04:16 - of 100 rather than the height of
04:18 - whatever is contained
04:20 - so minimum height 100 of the viewport
04:23 - or its parent which is html and body
04:25 - now we're going to come back to page
04:27 - content and give it some negative margin
04:29 - but first i want to move forward so that
04:32 - it makes sense why we're giving it
04:33 - negative margin so let's go down to
04:37 - page content
04:39 - after
04:42 - and we're going to say content it's
04:44 - going to be an empty string because you
04:46 - know when you have an after
04:48 - virtual element you need to give it
04:50 - content so that it actually appears
04:53 - and display block
04:57 - now we're going to do
04:58 - is below that we're going to select the
05:00 - footer
05:02 - and page content
05:05 - after
05:06 - now what we're doing here
05:08 - is we're selecting the footer itself
05:10 - and the after element
05:12 - the after virtual element of the page
05:15 - content
05:17 - and all we're doing is giving it a
05:18 - height of let's say
05:19 - 120 pixels
05:21 - now you need a fixed height for the
05:22 - footer it could be any height that you
05:24 - want if it's only 30 pixels or if it's
05:27 - 500 pixels it's up to you but you need
05:29 - to know the height that's the catch with
05:31 - the sticky footer the reason why
05:36 - is
05:37 - if i were to go and view this in the
05:38 - browser
05:41 - you can see now that the footer is
05:42 - actually
05:43 - below
05:45 - the viewport so if i scroll down
05:48 - there's 120 pixel footer below
05:51 - so all i need to do here is
05:54 - in the page content element which is
05:57 - everything within here
06:00 - is
06:01 - bring that footer up the height
06:03 - of
06:04 - its container so the height of the
06:06 - footer is 120 pixels so if we go back to
06:09 - page content
06:11 - and i'm just going to have a comment
06:12 - here that says
06:17 - margin
06:18 - bottom negative 120 pixels save that
06:22 - head over to your browser check out the
06:25 - student version
06:26 - and there's the sticky footer at the
06:28 - bottom
06:30 - i can't scroll up and down it's just
06:31 - there and if i were to bring the
06:33 - viewport smaller
06:35 - it's a perfect sticky footer if i
06:36 - brought it all the way up so it bumps up
06:38 - at the bottom of this content
06:40 - it's going to stop
06:42 - with the margin that is already declared
06:44 - there and i can scroll down
06:46 - so if this content grows
06:49 - this sticky footer stays where it is
06:51 - until it bumps up against it and it will
06:52 - push it further down but it is always
06:55 - stuck to the bottom of the viewport that
06:57 - is it for a sticky footer
07:00 - it's very simple quick overview in the
07:02 - markup we have page content
07:05 - that div and then outside of that div we
07:07 - have a footer
07:09 - and then a div within that footer for
07:10 - any content you have so essentially the
07:12 - markup looks like this you have a div
07:14 - with the class let's call it page
07:16 - content and then you have a footer all
07:19 - you're doing in the css
07:20 - is
07:22 - giving the html and the body a height of
07:24 - 100
07:26 - the page content itself needs to be
07:27 - minimum height of 100 percent and the
07:30 - page content after virtual element needs
07:32 - to be display block
07:34 - the footer and the page content after
07:36 - pseudo element or virtual element is 120
07:39 - pixels in this case it could be any
07:40 - height you want and then the page
07:42 - content needs a negative bottom margin
07:44 - of the same height as the footer
07:47 - and then you can see here
07:49 - that that is all the markup you need
07:51 - and it should work just fine over here
07:53 - in your browser that's it for the sticky
07:56 - footer go ahead and use that in your own
07:57 - websites i use it for my websites when i
08:00 - have a footer a client website or a
08:01 - project website if i have a footer that
08:03 - i need stuck to the bottom i will go
08:05 - ahead and create a sticky footer it
08:07 - takes no time out of your day and it's
08:09 - very quick to implement hopefully this
08:11 - was valuable to you see you tomorrow in
08:14 - day 14.
