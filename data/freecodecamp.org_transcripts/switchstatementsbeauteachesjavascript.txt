00:00 - switch statements the switch statement
00:02 - is a basic control structure used to
00:04 - perform different actions based on
00:06 - different conditions
00:07 - it's in most programming languages and
00:10 - let me give you an example
00:12 - you always start with the word switch
00:14 - and then you're going to put what you're
00:15 - going to check against so i'm going to
00:18 - check against this new date get day and
00:21 - this is going to give you a number for
00:23 - the day of the week
00:24 - and now you're going to check
00:26 - then you're going to put the word case
00:28 - and then you're going to put what the
00:29 - value is case 0 if new date that get day
00:34 - is zero
00:36 - day equals sunday
00:38 - and break and when you break it that
00:40 - means it's going to go it's going to be
00:42 - done with the rest of the code here and
00:44 - just go to the end of this the switch
00:45 - statement
00:46 - case one if new
00:49 - date dot get day equals one then day is
00:52 - going to equal monday break that means
00:53 - it's going to go to the end and so on
00:56 - now if you don't have the word break
00:59 - there it will just go on to the next
01:01 - case
01:03 - but when you do have the word break it's
01:04 - going to go all the way to the end so
01:06 - let me add some more things here first
01:08 - i'm going to say let
01:10 - day
01:11 - to create the the day variable and then
01:14 - at the end i'm going to say console.log
01:20 - day
01:21 - and if i
01:22 - run that
01:25 - you can see friday
01:26 - i'm making this video on a friday let me
01:29 - give you an example of a different k
01:31 - switch statement
01:33 - but this time we're going to create an
01:34 - animal giraffe now the switch statement
01:36 - we're going to pass in the animal so
01:38 - we're passing in this variable which
01:40 - happens to be giraffe and there's going
01:42 - to be a few different cases now here you
01:44 - can see that i have cases right one
01:47 - after the other case cow case giraffe
01:49 - case dog case pig
01:51 - and something to look at is that they
01:53 - don't say break until down here
01:56 - so
01:57 - no matter which of these animals it ends
01:59 - up matching with it just keeps going
02:02 - down until you get to where it says
02:03 - console.log and it's going to
02:05 - console.log this this animal will go on
02:08 - noah's ark and then it's going to break
02:11 - and when it breaks it goes down to the
02:12 - bottom it's no thick switch statement
02:14 - but then if it's k spoon it's going to
02:17 - console that log a spoon is on animal
02:19 - break that means it's going to go to the
02:20 - end case dinosaur or
02:23 - default console.log this and will not be
02:26 - on the arc
02:27 - now default means else so if
02:31 - what's being tested does not match any
02:34 - of the cases it's going to go to default
02:37 - so whether it's dinosaur or whether it's
02:41 - anything else it's going to count with
02:43 - that log this will and will not go on
02:45 - the arc so let's try that i'm going to
02:47 - run that
02:48 - and it's going to say this animal not go
02:50 - on the ark because of the giraffe if we
02:52 - change this to
02:53 - spoon
02:55 - and we run that
02:57 - a spoon is not an animal if we change
03:00 - this to chicken
03:02 - and then we run that
03:04 - this animal will not be on the arc
03:06 - because that's the default and if we had
03:07 - put dinosaur it would also go to the
03:09 - default
03:10 - well that's the switch statement thanks
