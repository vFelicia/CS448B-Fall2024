00:07 - Okay. Cool. Hey, everyone. How's everyone feeling?
00:12 - We got some energy?
00:15 - Alright. Awesome. That--that lunch is digested, and you're ready to learn.
00:20 - Okay, so I am Quincy,
00:22 - and I'm going to talk about how to write technical blog posts
00:26 - that people will actually read.
00:29 - That--that "actually read" part is important.
00:32 - So, you may be wondering: why is this developer talking about writing?
00:37 - Well, I worked as a journalist for about three years after college,
00:40 - and I would say that technical blogging was absolutely critical
00:46 - to people actually realizing that Free Code Camp existed
00:50 - and to our early community growth.
00:52 - We're a small nonprofit.
00:54 - We don't have, like, a lot of resources for advertising or for public relations
00:59 - so we turn to trying to write articles worth reading.
01:04 - So I've been writing very actively on both Medium and on Quora,
01:08 - and I also edit Free Code Camp's Medium publication,
01:13 - which publishes a whole lot of articles on development, design, and data science.
01:21 - So my goal is for all of you to walk out of here
01:25 - with both the confidence and the tools that you need to be able to write technical articles
01:31 - that people will sit down and actually invest the time in reading.
01:34 - So there are really three elements to this.
01:37 - First, you need substance.
01:39 - Second, you need to package that substance for consumption.
01:44 - And third, you need to go out and publicize it.
01:47 - So before we get into that, though,
01:49 - I want to see why people are blogging.
01:52 - I saw a lot of hands go up earlier for people who are blogging.
01:55 - I'm just gonna go up right now.
01:57 - Who is blogging because they want to impress future employers?
02:01 - Okay. Quite a few.
02:04 - All right, who wants to apply recently learned knowledge?
02:08 - One of the best ways to reinforce your own learning is to turn around and teach it to somebody else,
02:13 - And a technical blog post is an excellent way to do that.
02:16 - All right, and who just wants to share their insights with other developers and kind of pay it forward?
02:23 - Quite a few of you.
02:24 - And--
02:25 - Maybe nobody will raise their hand because this is a little immodest,
02:29 - but who is interested in becoming a thought leader in a specific domain?
02:33 - All right, yeah, you want to--
02:35 - So you want to get on the conference circuit.
02:37 - You want to get on podcasts like Code Newbie.
02:39 - And--and you want to raise awareness of your area of expertise. Great?
02:44 - It does not matter, like, regardless of your reason, it does not matter.
02:50 - Really the goal should be to just get people to read your articles.
02:55 - If you've set out to achieve that one single goal, it will help you with all four of those objectives.
03:01 - Let's start with substance.
03:03 - You need to write something that matters.
03:06 - And I will tell you that people quickly--
03:09 - they have all these kind of rules of thumb about blogging, like,
03:12 - Oh, it should be 600 words,
03:14 - and, you know, just quickly get it out there,
03:17 - and--and blog every single day.
03:19 - I don't buy any of that stuff
03:20 - I really think that it's all about substance.
03:22 - When you have something to say, that's when you open your mouth and you say it.
03:26 - And you can really hone in and take that substance and turn it into a whole lot of blog posts.
03:32 - This is a guy named Peter-Paul Koch.
03:34 - He is the author of the popular Quirks Mode blog.
03:38 - And Quirks Mode is really awesome because it's focused just on the quirks
03:43 - between different browsers and different versions of browsers,
03:47 - so he's--he totally geeked out on the difference between how, uh,
03:52 - JavaScript is processed by Internet Explorer 10 and mobile Safari and Opera.
03:58 - And his blog will show you all the different intricacies of those
04:02 - for when you're trying to develop cross-browser applications and those considerations.
04:08 - So what did he do? He did his homework?
04:10 - He learned a whole lot about this one subject, and he went really deep on it,
04:15 - then he turned around and figured out ways that he could write about it in novel ways,
04:21 - and that's what you should do.
04:22 - A lot of people may lament that, "Oh, everything's been written."
04:26 - "It's all been done." "Every flavor of breakfast cereal has been tried."
04:30 - Reality is there are always new ways,
04:33 - new permutations that you can toggle and switch around to make new original spins on old topics.
04:42 - A lot of blog posts are written either from a hello world,
04:46 - absolute beginner perspective,
04:48 - and then a lot of them are written from a "I've been coding for 10 years"
04:53 - There aren't enough articles that are kind of in the middle,
04:57 - for example, so experience level is one dimension in which you can play around.
05:02 - Then there are a lot of opportunities
05:05 - for taking something that's been written in a different language
05:08 - and blogging about how to do it in another language
05:11 - or introducing humor, right?
05:13 - Humor makes your blog post palatable, so use it liberally.
05:16 - And you can even write joke posts that are basically parodying something
05:20 - but teaching at the same time.
05:23 - So here's the quick case study. Want everybody to meet Amber.
05:27 - She is a Seattle-based marine biologist by training.
05:31 - She got her master's degree in marine biology, and she worked at Disney
05:34 - surveying the animals and doing science related to the animals that the Disney had and its parks.
05:41 - And unfortunately, marine biology is a field that a lot of people want to get into.
05:46 - People love animals.
05:47 - It's very competitive.
05:49 - Around the holiday season she found herself with her contract not renewed.
05:53 - To cheer herself up--
05:54 - She was really pumped. She's like, all right. I'm gonna go see the new Star Wars movie
05:58 - Did anybody see the new Star Wars movie?
06:01 - Rogue One.
06:03 - Okay, awesome.
06:04 - So she was really excited because, like, the first time it looked like a Star Wars movie where the protagonist was female.
06:11 - But when she walked out of the theater she had a weird sense
06:16 - that maybe the protagonist wasn't the female character.
06:20 - and sure enough she did the math and she counted up all the words,
06:23 - and she found that the main character actually didn't--
06:27 - didn't speak as many lines as some of the other characters.
06:30 - And she also noticed that there were far fewer female characters in that movie than there were male characters.
06:37 - And she was like, well, this seemed like it was marketed as a movie,
06:40 - you know, to women to try to get more women in the Star Wars
06:43 - So she looked at all the other blockbuster movies, like,
06:47 - the top 10 grossing movies of 2016.
06:50 - She built a bunch of data visualizations.
06:52 - She wrote scripts to dive through
06:54 - and count all the dialogue and assign the gender to the different characters,
06:59 - and she built this beautiful series of data visualizations.
07:03 - And so she had the substance; she just needed to sit down and write about it.
07:07 - And that's what she did.
07:09 - I coached her through it, and we wrote a Medium publication,
07:12 - and her article was huge.
07:15 - It got picked up by Mashable.
07:17 - It got picked up by IGN, a whole lot of international press.
07:20 - And it raised awareness of this issue.
07:22 - So she was able to use her scientific skills from being a marine biologist,
07:27 - kind of port it over to doing data visualization and data science,
07:31 - and as a result, a whole lot of employers
07:34 - and prospective freelancing contracts came her way from this article.
07:40 - So there's just one blog post, right?
07:42 - You only need to write one good blog post if it has good substance.
07:46 - So it's a lot of hard work.
07:48 - Expect to invest a lot of time and energy.
07:50 - Good blog posts don't come easily, not good technical blog posts.
07:55 - The second lesson I want you to all walk away from is that packaging is important--
08:00 - the way you take your substance,
08:03 - the way you package it and present it to the reader
08:06 - is very important.
08:09 - This is the most expensive vodka in the world
08:13 - I'm not a vodka connoisseur or anything,
08:17 - but when I saw these bottles, I was immediately sucked in.
08:19 - I wanted to learn more about it, right?
08:21 - It's packaging.
08:23 - Well, what's the packaging on a blog post?
08:25 - You've got your headline.
08:26 - You've got your lead image
08:28 - You have the formatting of the text and the sub heads and the pull quotes.
08:33 - And then you've got the platform that you publish it in.
08:35 - All of those things are considerations that you should keep in mind when it comes to packaging your technical blog post.
08:43 - I want to talk about headlines specifically because I want to point out that
08:47 - that is all that about 95 percent of people are going to read.
08:52 - They're scrolling through their--their Twitter feed
08:54 - while they're sitting on the toilet or while they're holding the handle on a bus,
08:57 - and they're like, "Do I want to read this? Do I want to read this?"
09:00 - They read your headline,
09:01 - and it's up to your headline to entice them to read the rest of your article.
09:06 - So has anybody heard the old adage
09:09 - by Abe Lincoln about chopping down trees?
09:13 - So...
09:15 - if I had eight hours to write a technical blog post,
09:21 - I'd spend the first six sharpening the headline.
09:25 - It's true. The headline really is--
09:28 - Empires have been built on the backs of headlines.
09:30 - Has anybody heard of BuzzFeed?
09:32 - You know, and there's a science to it.
09:34 - There's a lot. You can--you can read up on.
09:37 - And you can A/B test your headlines.
09:39 - You can show them to your friends and just try to figure out if people will click on them.
09:42 - It's really that important.
09:44 - And then the images.
09:46 - Humans are highly visual creatures.
09:48 - Like, our our visual cortex is one of the biggest parts of our brain.
09:51 - So you've got a cater to that.
09:53 - You've got to show people images.
09:55 - 86% of the top blog posts have images in them,
10:00 - and on average, they'll have at least one image every 350 words.
10:06 - Some of you may be like well, I can't afford to license really good images.
10:10 - Well, there's great news.
10:11 - There are so many generous photographers out there who take their images and turn them to Creative Commons
10:17 - or even Creative Commons 0, which doesn't even require attribution.
10:20 - You can just splash their photo up on there.
10:21 - And this website Pexels.
10:24 - You can search around and find images that are public domain
10:29 - or Creative Commons license on a number of platforms.
10:33 - So in terms of formatting,
10:35 - you need to be sure that you don't get the Picardian wall of text, right?
10:42 - People will bounce if they see English comp 101,
10:47 - eight-sentence paragraphs.
10:49 - Remember Reddit is only an alt tab away.
10:54 - So be sure that you show them...
10:59 - nice short paragraphs, nice short sentences.
11:02 - It's not a matter of sounding like dumbing it down.
11:06 - A lot of people look at it that way.
11:07 - You can express the exact same concepts in much simpler words
11:12 - and you can use short paragraphs and you can use white space.
11:16 - You can use subheads you can use pull-quotes.
11:18 - All those things to break that up.
11:20 - The platform you publish it on makes a big difference.
11:24 - These are some of the most popular ways that people publish their technical blog posts.
11:28 - So I am a big fan of Medium.
11:30 - It's ad-free.
11:31 - It's--it's user-supported.
11:34 - And it allows for easy export of your content.
11:38 - And it has a built-in audience that's quite big.
11:41 - They get, like, 86 million visits a month.
11:43 - And then you can also post on blog--on your own private blog.
11:47 - You can just use a GitHub Pages blog
11:49 - and create--get your own domain and set it up that way, too.
11:51 - There are trade-offs associated with all these.
11:54 - If you happen to have a whole lot of friends on LinkedIn
11:56 - or if you happen to have a whole lot of friends on Facebook,
11:58 - that might be a good place to publish, too.
11:59 - Notice a lot of celebrities have been blogging on--directly on Facebook.
12:04 - So here's another case study. This is Ohans.
12:07 - He is a web developer in Lagos, Nigeria,
12:11 - and he created this amazing guide to Flexbox.
12:15 - The only problem was he just created markdown files and folders and pushed it to GitHub and left.
12:23 - He left it at that.
12:24 - Well, you can go one step further
12:27 - and actually write an article, a proper article,
12:30 - and that's what I convinced him to do.
12:31 - So if you look at this, he has a nice headline that accurately describes--
12:37 - it's not a clickbait headline--
12:39 - what the article is, and then he's got some images.
12:41 - He breaks up the text with tweets,
12:44 - and he's got subheadings.
12:45 - He's got short paragraphs, short sentences.
12:47 - It's easy to read.
12:48 - It's--it's a breezy read
12:49 - even though it's about 10,000 words, right?
12:52 - Like, you're gonna be reading for about an hour,
12:55 - and you're literally going to learn all about Flexbox.
12:58 - And it may seem like, well, who has time to sit down and read an hour-long article about flexbox?
13:04 - People read 500-word blog posts, right?
13:07 - Well, actually, this is one of the most popular technical articles ever published.
13:11 - It's been viewed more than a 100,000 times,
13:14 - and as a result, he got inquiries from book publishers.
13:17 - He even had some course platforms reach out to him
13:20 - who wanted him to create some workshops on Flexbox,
13:23 - So again, he had substance.
13:26 - He knew Flexbox very well.
13:27 - He packaged it properly, and he profited.
13:30 - Lesson number three: Publicize.
13:32 - You may have heard the expression in software development:
13:36 - The last 10% of the work takes 90% of the time.
13:41 - Well, let me tell you: publicizing your work is the last 10%,
13:46 - and it's gonna take 90% of your time.
13:48 - There is no build it and they'll come.
13:50 - You need to go out and tell people that this exists,
13:55 - and you need to actively advocate for people to read your own article.
14:00 - One place you can put it is Hacker News.
14:02 - I like to call it the Hacker News lottery
14:04 - because, honestly, there's like--
14:06 - I could publish, like, the best article I've ever written on Hacker News,
14:09 - and nobody would notice,
14:11 - or some random article that I published might show up at the top one day
14:14 - because somebody submitted it.
14:16 - It's, like, totally random, and I can tell you I see totally random things on Hacker News.
14:22 - You see totally random things at the top of Reddit sometimes.
14:26 - But if you keep submitting, every--every time you submit,
14:30 - that's a lottery ticket, right?
14:32 - And you need to pay to win--
14:34 - or you need to play to win.
14:35 - So you can also target specific Facebook groups.
14:38 - There are a lot of really big Facebook groups.
14:41 - Some of them are local to your city.
14:43 - Maybe your alumni group on Facebook from your university or from your high school.
14:47 - Share it with your friends that way.
14:48 - Groups are a great way to spread it.
14:51 - You can also use LinkedIn.
14:52 - (Laughter)
14:54 - People do use LinkedIn groups.
14:56 - It does send, like, email digests.
14:58 - People might see it.
14:59 - And then I would also say use other people's audiences.
15:04 - So if you publish on a Medium publication,
15:06 - you're immediately, kind of, hijacking the audience of that publication
15:10 - for a moment to get their attention
15:11 - If you publish it in Forbes or TechCrunch
15:14 - or some of these other major publications
15:17 - that actually submit, kind of, op-ed reader posts--
15:21 - And--and you can actually become a writer for Forbes or a writer for TechCrunch
15:24 - and publish right on there,
15:26 - and that way you're borrowing their credibility as well as their audience.
15:31 - So just to summarize...
15:34 - three things to remember:
15:36 - Create technical blog posts that are substantial,
15:40 - package them for consumption,
15:42 - and publicize them like crazy.
15:44 - If you do that, you'll write blog posts that people will actually sit down and read.
15:48 - Thank you very much.
15:50 - (Applause)
15:59 - Great job.
