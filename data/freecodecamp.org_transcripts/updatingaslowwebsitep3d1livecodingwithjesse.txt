00:12 - hey everybody is Jessie today we're
00:15 - gonna start on an entirely new project
00:18 - so we're we may not be finished with the
00:22 - last project we might come back to it
00:24 - but right now there's just not a lot
00:25 - going on with it and the things that
00:27 - remain to be done there are other things
00:32 - that we've done before sometimes
00:34 - multiple times on the stream or they're
00:38 - just not really a big deal so I don't
00:40 - know that they were streaming but today
00:43 - I want to kind of get you familiarized
00:47 - with the site that will be working on
00:50 - probably for for the rest of the month
00:55 - and just kind of let you know some of
00:59 - the background if you're interested I
01:04 - did do some videos where we were trying
01:07 - to fix this site a bit before so this is
01:11 - on my my youtube channel so there's a
01:15 - link in the description but the video
01:18 - that's first ever live coding session it
01:21 - I talked about this website in there I'm
01:25 - pretty sure let's see the quality yeah
01:27 - so the max quality is 720p and I think
01:30 - the font size is too small so it was my
01:33 - first session so I was kind of messing
01:35 - things up a bit
01:37 - but you can still hear me
01:40 - so you can get an idea of what's going
01:42 - on with this but I'm gonna try to
01:43 - summarize everything and what we're
01:46 - trying to accomplish so it's not
01:49 - necessary that you go back and watch
01:51 - that but if you wanted more info I think
01:53 - maybe this video and maybe the next two
01:55 - two or three live streams after are
01:58 - about this site and this is a site that
02:03 - I'm that we're working on it this is a
02:06 - public site so Franciscan edu and it's
02:12 - slow so there's other things wrong with
02:14 - the site but for today we're gonna focus
02:16 - on how slow it is
02:23 - I ran a page speed test earlier and this
02:30 - is what we got 29 out of 100 which is
02:34 - good compared to what it was so when I
02:38 - earlier this year I had some time to
02:41 - work on this site and the score was
02:43 - actually one so I'll have to find a
02:48 - screenshot a pretty shot took a
02:50 - screenshot of it this is the lowest
02:51 - score I've ever seen if I can find that
02:54 - I'll show you all but I'm pretty sure it
02:55 - was it was one and yeah so it's better
03:00 - than it was but there's still a lot so
03:02 - you can see some are easy things like
03:04 - just image reducing image sizes
03:07 - compressing images some are things that
03:11 - are a little bit more difficult and some
03:13 - things we won't be able to change we'll
03:16 - just kind of have to work with it so
03:18 - things like server response time I don't
03:21 - really have access to anything with the
03:23 - server right now this it's a whole
03:25 - different department where I work that
03:27 - handles that so I won't directly be able
03:29 - to change anything I can try to work
03:31 - with the other department though to get
03:34 - some things change so as you can see in
03:37 - this particular test server response
03:39 - time was 1.1 seconds that's not good
03:42 - I've seen it as high as seven seconds
03:44 - with this server and yeah so it doesn't
03:52 - matter how fast we make this site we
03:54 - still have to deal with this server
03:55 - response time so hopefully I can do
03:59 - something about that or at least talk to
04:01 - people who can do something about that
04:03 - also my camera keeps freezing so I will
04:14 - I'll try to fix it I don't know what the
04:17 - problem is but I came in today and it
04:22 - was it wasn't working so there's some
04:24 - command that I can type in to get it to
04:27 - work but it's only working temporarily
04:28 - so let's see all right let me let me go
04:42 - to the live chat quickly just to say hi
04:44 - before we get started
04:46 - hey everybody
04:51 - Oh is there Joseph says there's an apple
04:55 - event going on my streaming doing it
04:58 - during an event I've done this before
05:01 - I should pay more attention to what's
05:05 - going on but if I don't have a lot of
05:07 - people I'm gonna blame it on that but
05:08 - actually it looks like there's a lot of
05:10 - people right now I mean more than more
05:12 - than usual so yeah today we're going to
05:17 - work with some stuff that we are we've
05:20 - never worked with before so in
05:23 - particular this this site was built with
05:27 - a content management system called
05:29 - Ektron and that system is based off of
05:31 - dotnet framework and so there's some
05:33 - c-sharp stuff I don't know how much
05:35 - we're gonna get into c-sharp today but
05:38 - we will get into it at some point so we
05:40 - made we may start looking at it I don't
05:43 - know how much we're actually gonna edit
05:47 - let's see John B said no longer
05:51 - camera-shy
05:51 - yeah I'm trying this out I'm trying the
05:53 - camera thing uh-huh John B says I reach
05:59 - your camera a twenty nine out of 100
06:02 - would can I look and I improve is it the
06:05 - quality or is it my face I'm not all
06:12 - right cool so let's get started
06:15 - I always forget to do this at the
06:17 - beginning but if you're just watching
06:18 - for the first time though this stream is
06:20 - just about me doing my everyday work so
06:23 - it's not necessarily a tutorial although
06:27 - I try to explain things as I
06:28 - along and there are a lot of people in
06:29 - the live chat that are very helpful
06:31 - answering questions but I just want
06:34 - other developers to see what it's like
06:36 - for me to do my job I don't know if I'm
06:39 - an average developer or not I don't
06:41 - really know if my workflow is is the
06:44 - norm but I thought it would be useful if
06:47 - other people especially maybe people who
06:49 - work on their own or who are just kind
06:51 - of starting out could you see what it's
06:53 - like for me see how many mistakes I make
06:56 - and how I've worked through that and so
07:00 - that's so that's what we're doing here
07:02 - so if you do see a lot of mistakes if it
07:05 - seems like it's unscripted that's kind
07:08 - of the point so it's not scripted and I
07:11 - will make mistakes so that said let's
07:16 - get to it I like to organize the streams
07:19 - with Pomodoro timer so I'll do 25
07:22 - minutes of coding or you know whatever
07:25 - kind of whatever we happen to be doing
07:27 - it's not always code like right now
07:29 - we're gonna be going through some of the
07:32 - site speed things but I'm gonna do that
07:35 - for 25 minutes so I'll take a
07:36 - five-minute break and I'll go through
07:37 - the live chat and answer any questions
07:39 - you have and then we'll just repeat
07:41 - today we'll probably do two Pomodoro
07:43 - sessions I'd like to like to keep this
07:48 - dream a little bit short I'm still
07:50 - working on that react nanodegree and I
07:52 - have a project a Redux project due by
07:55 - Friday and it is not done yet so I need
08:00 - to work on it so that's why I don't want
08:03 - to do a really long stream I want to get
08:05 - done and work on it a little bit a
08:07 - little bit more okay so I'm just going
08:13 - to start with some explanation of what
08:17 - the site is what's what's wrong with it
08:19 - what we're gonna try to change hopefully
08:23 - you know by the end of September we'll
08:25 - see how much we can get done all right
08:27 - so this is the site the main site for
08:29 - the university that I work at I'm a
08:31 - front-end developer for Franciscan
08:34 - University this site was built before I
08:39 - started working here I think it it's a
08:42 - three years old in terms of when it was
08:44 - launched it's about three years but in
08:46 - terms of development it's pushing four
08:48 - years I think because the site was built
08:51 - and went underwent a lot of testing and
08:53 - things so it's about four years old and
08:58 - it's definitely in need of some bigger
09:00 - updates than we're gonna handle this
09:02 - month but the completely redesigning
09:06 - everything from the ground up is going
09:08 - to be a project that's going to come
09:10 - hopefully within the next year but not
09:13 - not right now so right now we're just
09:16 - going to try to make the best of what we
09:17 - have all right and what we have as I
09:20 - mentioned earlier is a site built off
09:24 - the Ektron content management system if
09:26 - you've never heard of ektron then I'm
09:28 - not surprised because I never heard of
09:30 - ektron before I started here and it's
09:37 - it's a challenging content management
09:39 - system to work with luckily I don't have
09:41 - to do that much with it there are other
09:43 - people in my department who handle most
09:45 - of the content management with that and
09:48 - I don't usually have to deal deal with
09:51 - it directly but right now we've already
09:57 - showed you the the site speed rating and
10:01 - if you wanted to look at this in more
10:03 - detail you could just run the site speed
10:05 - test yourself on the site but the first
10:09 - thing that we're definitely going to be
10:11 - able to do is we're gonna be able to
10:13 - compress some of these images but even
10:15 - better than that what I think we can do
10:17 - is actually get rid of some images so
10:21 - let's see browser caching I don't know
10:26 - that I can do anything about the caching
10:27 - so things that I can't do anything about
10:29 - I'm gonna hide we can try to eliminate
10:32 - the render blocking JavaScript and CSS
10:34 - I'll show you in a minute what we're
10:39 - kind of what we're dealing with here in
10:42 - terms of how this gets put into you know
10:46 - by Extron you know how things get put
10:48 - together so I don't have complete
10:50 - control over over all the files some of
10:55 - them are
10:55 - created dynamically and just put in here
10:58 - and there but we'll do the best we can
10:59 - you see this there's quite a few files
11:03 - being loaded here can't do anything
11:04 - directly about the server response time
11:07 - and we're gonna try to fix this you know
11:11 - prioritize visible content but that's
11:14 - that's going to need we need to do some
11:16 - work also when it comes to minifying the
11:19 - JavaScript I I can't
11:24 - minify a lot of these directly because I
11:27 - don't know where they're coming in at so
11:30 - that's one of the bad things about
11:32 - Extron is there's not really an exxon
11:35 - community like if this was WordPress I'd
11:38 - probably find 500 articles about how
11:41 - something works probably more with
11:44 - Ektron not so much the company that made
11:48 - Ektron originally got bought out by
11:50 - another company so I'm not even sure it
11:52 - what the support is like with Exxon
11:55 - anymore
11:58 - and then minify HTML probably won't be
12:02 - able to minify the HTML and uh if you're
12:06 - if you're wondering why we can't do
12:07 - certain things it'll be a little bit
12:09 - more clear in a minute although I know
12:11 - some of you are good with c-sharp Sarno
12:14 - Umberto's good with c-sharp so maybe
12:16 - some things that I don't think I can do
12:18 - right now maybe we can do and I just
12:20 - don't don't know how so anyway that's
12:23 - what we're dealing with the biggest
12:26 - images on the page are obviously the
12:28 - images in this slider and they all load
12:30 - so these there's no lazy loading going
12:32 - on here all these images load and
12:38 - they're all pretty big now obviously
12:42 - they need to be a certain size if it's
12:44 - gonna be you know a large slider like
12:47 - this but some images are actually really
12:50 - big and they don't need to be like this
12:52 - image is one of the largest images on
12:54 - the page but it's tiny right so there's
12:57 - little things like that that we can
12:58 - change and that really the the people
13:01 - who are updating this site through the
13:03 - content management system need to be
13:06 - aware of
13:08 - the size of images that they're putting
13:10 - in and making sure that they compress
13:12 - the images so we'll handle that I don't
13:17 - want to do too much compression and
13:19 - things and image resizing on the stream
13:21 - because I don't think that's it's just
13:23 - not really exciting stuff it might be
13:25 - worth it just to go over how I do it but
13:28 - I don't want to go through a ton of
13:29 - images and do you know resizing and
13:33 - things some of the images I think we can
13:35 - get rid of are these I don't think that
13:40 - we need these here and these are these
13:43 - images are pretty big so each one of
13:45 - these sections we could probably take
13:47 - the images out completely we want to
13:50 - make sure I did go through a few months
13:52 - ago and made sure these images were the
13:54 - correct size and compressed but it's
13:56 - possible that you know some new ones
13:58 - have been uploaded so we want to double
14:00 - check that the same way this image
14:02 - changes frequently so we want to double
14:04 - check to make sure that image is is
14:07 - working correctly I know the user
14:12 - interface wise there's a ton of stuff I
14:14 - want to change with this user interface
14:16 - but the first thing that I want to worry
14:19 - about is the the load times because if
14:21 - if the page takes too long to load and
14:24 - someone doesn't even stick around to see
14:26 - it then it doesn't matter how nice it
14:28 - looks it could be the best looking site
14:30 - ever made but if it takes you know 50
14:33 - seconds to load no one's gonna see it
14:38 - all right so let me see if there's ice
14:41 - want to see if there's any questions
14:43 - quickly in the live chat about you know
14:45 - but before we actually start to dig into
14:48 - some of the some of the code so I'm just
14:52 - going to quickly kind of scroll through
14:54 - this and see if there's any questions
14:55 - related to the site
15:07 - okay all right cool it looks like
15:10 - nothing related to this site although
15:11 - John Hanson does say if you do a Google
15:13 - page speed test they'll actually give
15:15 - you the compressed files to download the
15:17 - images yeah that's true I'm glad you
15:20 - mentioned that
15:21 - I'm see where they are at the bottom
15:24 - yeah so you can download we do a page
15:27 - speed test you can download all your
15:30 - compressed resources so I have used some
15:36 - of these before so we may we may get
15:40 - some of these for the images I have I
15:43 - use image magic on the command line and
15:45 - I have I'm able to get better
15:47 - compression than I can get from these
15:50 - also we're gonna need to resize some of
15:52 - them as well but it'll probably be
15:54 - useful to grab some of this JavaScript
15:56 - and CSS at some point you know we could
16:00 - benefit ourselves but if it's already
16:02 - done for us then you know why not use it
16:04 - all right so we're just gonna deal with
16:10 - the home page for now obviously that
16:14 - gets the most visitors and it's also the
16:15 - page that takes the longest by far to
16:18 - load so some of the Interior pages
16:19 - aren't quite as bad for load times so
16:25 - we'll see how it goes if I don't think
16:28 - we'll get this you know to where we
16:31 - really want it in the amount of time
16:33 - that we have but if we if we do we'll
16:34 - move on maybe in work on some interior
16:36 - pages I'm gonna be using sue I want to
16:43 - bring this over so it's closer all right
16:48 - there we go I want to bring I want to
16:53 - show you my Trello board as well so I do
16:58 - have a Trello board that I already made
17:00 - a few months ago just a lot of things
17:03 - that I thought could be done to help
17:05 - with load time so you know we're gonna
17:09 - we're gonna go through some of these we
17:11 - don't have to come up with everything
17:13 - you know on our own right now so you
17:18 - know a basic stuff minify these files
17:20 - but some of the things are
17:21 - actually redoing the UI so that we can
17:25 - get away with not having so many images
17:27 - or we can completely get rid of some
17:29 - pieces of code that for whatever reason
17:32 - are slowing things down a bit this is
17:35 - the file that we're going to be working
17:38 - with mostly as you can see I'm actually
17:44 - using Visual Studio code so I know we
17:51 - always have peeps someone always asks
17:53 - about my code editors so it's Visual
17:55 - Studio code this time and not Adam so I
18:00 - have we're mainly going to be working in
18:03 - this file although you can see there's a
18:05 - lot of different things linked into this
18:07 - file so we're gonna have to dig into
18:08 - some of these other files as well but
18:10 - this is a copy of the the template that
18:18 - is used for the home page so we'll do
18:22 - everything in the copy so we don't mess
18:25 - up the home page and when we get it to a
18:28 - point where it's it's good we like it
18:30 - then we can just copy it over or change
18:34 - the name and use that instead for the
18:38 - home page so just kind of scrolling
18:40 - through quickly up here we're importing
18:43 - so it's actually it's not it's not
18:46 - really that in terms of organization and
18:50 - what's going on there there's some
18:52 - similarities to what we're doing with
18:54 - react right we're importing a lot of
18:56 - other great components I don't know what
18:58 - the terminology is for extra honor for
19:01 - for.net framework stuff but in terms of
19:04 - the terminology that we've been using
19:06 - with react you know we're importing
19:07 - components up here and then down here
19:12 - we're mixing HTML with some of these
19:16 - other try to find it okay with some of
19:22 - these these tags here right so we can
19:27 - put in you know these things that we've
19:30 - imported up there we put them in with
19:32 - these tags and we pass props to them
19:34 - right so it's it's really a lot like
19:37 - react components it just at least
19:40 - superficially I have no idea what's
19:41 - going on behind the scenes and whether
19:43 - it's comparable to react but at least
19:48 - you know so the we can reason about it
19:49 - that's basically what it is and I'm
19:51 - probably gonna still use react
19:53 - terminology because like I said I don't
19:55 - really know what the exon terminology is
19:57 - for this stuff and I don't really care
19:59 - to learn it since we're not gonna be
20:01 - using it for that much longer anyway
20:05 - so let's go into let's go in into the
20:16 - the code is controlling this this
20:21 - carousel here so this is kind of like
20:23 - the hero section carousel I want to get
20:27 - rid of it I want it to be completely
20:29 - gone right this that seems to me like
20:34 - it'll have the biggest immediate impact
20:36 - on load times out of anything else that
20:40 - I could do or at least that I could
20:42 - easily do because these are the largest
20:45 - images I get rid of one oops actually
20:51 - it's not even some weird stuff going on
20:54 - there's they're like three or four
20:55 - images I think four images so four large
20:58 - images on the page can be gone we'll get
21:00 - rid of that and we'll also get rid of
21:02 - these so basically the eighth-largest
21:09 - images on the page we're gonna get rid
21:10 - of I think that's gonna have a huge
21:12 - impact also wouldn't be a bad idea to
21:17 - just do just a baseline to see what our
21:21 - load times are so let's just check out
21:25 - I'm gonna change my network conditions
21:27 - here and throttle it let's go with let's
21:31 - go with a fast 3G and see what it's like
21:33 - on Fast 3G I like to slow it down just
21:37 - so that I get a better idea of what it's
21:40 - like for people with slower connections
21:41 - and also you can kind of see things
21:43 - loading when it's a slower connection
21:47 - so I'm just gonna refresh and we'll see
21:56 - see what we get
22:05 - you see how slow that was right like
22:07 - waiting for the response and the network
22:09 - that was really slow all right so we're
22:19 - still waiting I mean at this point it's
22:21 - the page is usable but not everything is
22:24 - loaded yet so you scroll down it's
22:28 - pretty much everything was loaded we're
22:30 - still waiting on some of these images
22:34 - okay are we done now
22:36 - yeah all right total load time thirty
22:39 - five point seven five seconds so almost
22:42 - 36 seconds total load time right
22:45 - obviously the page was usable you could
22:48 - see content a lot earlier than that but
22:53 - you know you still had this little thing
22:55 - you know go on up here or whatever it
22:59 - does with Chrome a humph
23:01 - for for 36 seconds that's crazy that's I
23:07 - don't know I don't know let you but to
23:09 - me that's just really slow so let's
23:15 - let's just see what took the longest all
23:22 - right let's see what the biggest files
23:24 - were so we have an image okay this is up
23:31 - there and that in the slider but I think
23:35 - that's the main image there and then we
23:37 - have okay this is the one with the
23:41 - president the university this one is
23:46 - that image that's that's here that's
23:49 - really small that should not be this big
23:53 - right where this image is 370 kilobytes
24:00 - it's crazy that first image one point
24:02 - three megabytes that's completely
24:03 - unacceptable
24:04 - okay as we go down it gets better but as
24:09 - as usual your biggest files or images
24:14 - that's I mean unless you have video on
24:16 - your site your biggest files are
24:17 - probably
24:18 - always going to be images you can see we
24:20 - are loading some bigger JavaScript files
24:24 - so jQuery UI
24:26 - completes right I wonder if we really
24:30 - need that or if we need we need
24:32 - everything there I'm interested to see
24:34 - if that's okay at least it's minified
24:39 - that's that's good that's crazy that
24:43 - it's still that big even minified though
24:46 - we'd see these anything that says banner
24:48 - those are those big sections here right
24:53 - so they're kind of towards the top as
24:55 - well we want to get rid of that okay it
25:03 - looks like there's there's no surprises
25:04 - I was kind of looking for something up
25:08 - towards the top that would just be you
25:10 - know really big but it's not not bad I
25:18 - mean I expected it with the images so so
25:23 - that's definitely I think where we need
25:24 - to goodness 24 seconds for that Wow
25:31 - that's where we need to look first
25:32 - that's we're gonna have the biggest
25:33 - impact okay oh I did I just looked over
25:40 - the live chat quickly and
25:47 - I noticed that my camera stops I'm
25:49 - resetting that again if anybody ever has
25:52 - it has had issues with an iMac camera
25:55 - just all of a sudden not working right
25:58 - like the little green light just goes
25:59 - black and bright in the middle of me
26:03 - doing stuff it's right on the main
26:06 - screen
26:07 - - hmm excuse me
26:11 - it's yawning my secondary screen I
26:14 - haven't had any problems with that but
26:16 - the angle is weird so you just see like
26:19 - the side of my face the whole time so
26:23 - anyway I'll probably end up getting a
26:26 - like a USB webcam at some point so it
26:29 - shouldn't be a problem for that much
26:30 - longer but for now it's just a little
26:32 - annoyance but I also saw Nova blow asked
26:35 - why I'm in incognito mode because I I'm
26:41 - an administrator for this site it
26:43 - automatically logs me in and I don't
26:45 - really want to lock myself out on when
26:48 - I'm using Chrome not in incognito mode
26:50 - and other files get loaded and so I
26:55 - don't want to mess with the
26:56 - administrator type you know files that
26:59 - get for the UI for the admins I just
27:03 - want to see what other people see so
27:04 - that's why I'm doing it in incognito
27:06 - mode
27:13 - it also allows me to switch right over
27:15 - it so I usually have the same site open
27:18 - in normally in Chrome with the admin
27:22 - features there so I can switch over and
27:24 - change things really quick without
27:25 - having to log in and log back out every
27:30 - time I look at this site I just see more
27:31 - things that I don't want to fix and
27:35 - change okay
27:46 - so let me show you if we're gonna take
27:51 - this out we need to replace it with
27:53 - something right we can't just completely
27:55 - remove it that would look kind of weird
28:00 - let me show you what I'm thinking of for
28:03 - the replacement yeah sorry
28:08 - yawning again I don't know what's going
28:11 - on I don't think I brought it over yet
28:17 - but still be on my other screen all
28:20 - right so let me show you what I'm
28:28 - thinking so this this obviously when you
28:30 - see it you're gonna know why I'm saying
28:31 - this obviously isn't gonna be what we
28:33 - put in here but just kind of the basic
28:35 - structure is gonna be more what we use
28:37 - so let me try to do as much of side by
28:43 - side as I can so right now you see this
28:45 - is the the header here's our menus not
28:52 - not really a fan of this too much here's
28:57 - what I'd like to to move it to and this
29:02 - should look at least somewhat familiar
29:03 - since this kind of the same style is
29:05 - what we used on our last project but I'd
29:07 - like to switch over to this I think I'll
29:09 - take this logo out and use our new logo
29:11 - that we used on our last project when I
29:15 - did this before I don't think I had the
29:17 - new logo yet so that will change but
29:22 - you'd see I've moved the header I move
29:26 - some stuff around on the header I think
29:28 - it looks looks more clean I've had
29:31 - actually added some of the social media
29:33 - icons so I think it looks a lot nicer I
29:38 - Shrunk the search search bar a bit and
29:43 - added a lot of things in the sidebar so
29:46 - you can see all those menu items are
29:49 - still there but now they've moved over
29:52 - over here okay and we have search over
29:55 - there as well if you're interested in
29:58 - how I did this
29:59 - check out those videos on my channel
30:01 - that I showed you at the beginning
30:02 - because I do go through a lot of how I
30:05 - did this header and how I did this this
30:08 - background so it's it's really simple I
30:10 - mean it's a simple like parallax style
30:12 - background but I'm thinking right now we
30:15 - have four big images and sometimes we
30:17 - have even more images on here just
30:19 - depends on how many are uploaded at any
30:22 - given time so we'll go from that down to
30:25 - one large image so we'll still have a
30:29 - hero section we just won't have all
30:32 - those images so this is just a stock
30:36 - photo obviously we also have and you can
30:43 - see I didn't finish this right we have a
30:44 - spot for you know for some text a
30:47 - call-to-action button right and then
30:52 - below obviously I haven't read I haven't
30:57 - finished this but you can see I've gone
31:02 - with a full-width wow that's weird
31:05 - that's really weird I haven't seen that
31:08 - happen before
31:13 - hmm that's crazy
31:18 - I've honestly never seen that happen
31:23 - oh is that I don't know what I'm I don't
31:30 - know what happened there I guess I
31:32 - turned off that that's server yeah all
31:38 - right
31:43 - oh that's why so I I didn't have any of
31:48 - my NPM modules installed for that
31:51 - project and so my gulp server wasn't
31:55 - running so anyway I'm gonna I'm
31:57 - installing things on my other screen
32:00 - here so but did you get the idea of kind
32:06 - of what I want to do is just kind of
32:09 - redesign this section here so I can get
32:11 - rid of these images I'm also gonna be
32:13 - able to get rid of a lot of these images
32:15 - as well so look we have you know we have
32:18 - more images here and it'll clean things
32:23 - up there and I mean we're gonna get rid
32:26 - of at least a dozen images so definitely
32:33 - gonna be it's gonna be a lot more light
32:38 - wait and see looks like
32:58 - for some reason my my install fails all
33:08 - right then so I'm getting some area that
33:13 - I've never seen before
33:24 - I'll give it another shot see if it
33:26 - works not really a big deal we can still
33:28 - do a lot of this without mmm just own
33:34 - that again shoot okay so my um my timer
33:39 - went up so now is a good time this to
33:41 - break for five minutes I'll go over the
33:43 - live chat and then while I'm doing that
33:47 - let's see
33:58 - yes I'll bring this over to so y'all can
34:00 - see what's going on here all right so
34:07 - check that out I'm in tonight hopefully
34:15 - you won't see the air again but if it
34:16 - comes up you'll see it don't ya so
34:41 - all right so I may just have to that's
34:47 - really weird
34:48 - I just have to check that out later on
34:53 - all right so I'm going to scroll up a
34:55 - bit and I'm gonna go through the live
34:56 - chat answer questions for five minutes
34:58 - and then we'll go back and try to
35:01 - actually get changed some things on this
35:03 - page okay Michael will Avila says give
35:13 - me a shout out so actually just shut up
35:18 - anyway so there's a shout out so thanks
35:21 - for watching thanks for for being
35:23 - involved in the live chat
35:41 - all right Patrick says he sharp for the
35:43 - win not but I hear dotnet core 2 is
35:46 - really fast as opposed to older dotnet
35:48 - tech yeah unfortunately this is older
35:51 - dog net tech so so not to me working
35:54 - with the new cool stuff yet
36:04 - yeah
36:09 - all right I'm just I'm still scrolling
36:11 - through trying to find some questions
36:13 - here in the live chat
36:15 - okay so des es says just starting out
36:20 - and want to get in the IT world is
36:22 - front-end or back-end the best or ideal
36:25 - way to go I think it honestly depends on
36:31 - what you're interested in
36:33 - I don't know I guess I've I've seen or
36:39 - either read about examples of people
36:41 - starting with either front-end or
36:43 - back-end and then sometimes they moved
36:45 - to they switch sometimes they go full
36:49 - stack I don't know it really does depend
36:54 - on what you're more interested in as to
36:55 - where you want to start out you could
36:57 - always switch yeah I guess it would be
37:01 - hard to answer you know in general from
37:06 - what I've seen and this is you know I've
37:09 - not studied this you know but just from
37:12 - like casually observing it does seem
37:14 - like salaries for back-end are slightly
37:17 - higher than for front-end but I don't
37:20 - know if that's just if that's true
37:22 - across the board or you know just the
37:24 - few times I've noticed it so I don't
37:28 - know that could be a factor for you
37:34 - rune grin shoe says learn front end
37:37 - stuff somewhat well then learn back-end
37:39 - then combine and improve join B says
37:46 - depends on if you prefer working with
37:48 - routing and networking or if you prefer
37:49 - working with design and user interfaces
37:52 - front-end is UI back-end is routing a
37:55 - networking Verito says I don't think I'm
37:59 - ever gonna be very good at front-end
38:01 - design just not something I'm very
38:03 - interested in or good at for that matter
38:07 - yeah I'm Berto I would say if you're not
38:12 - interested in it then there's really
38:13 - probably not much reason to try to try
38:16 - to work on it but if you did want to get
38:19 - better at it I think it's one of those
38:20 - things that it's
38:23 - takes time right it takes a long time to
38:28 - just get that I to look at something and
38:30 - say and I'm not saying I have this
38:31 - perfectly but just comparing myself to
38:33 - where I was like let's say five years
38:35 - ago to be able to look at a website and
38:37 - immediately start to pick out places
38:40 - where the design could be improved
38:42 - whether there's just obvious things or
38:45 - to be able to look at a blank page and
38:47 - just start to visualize where everything
38:49 - would go I that just takes a lot of time
38:54 - of being exposed to it I don't know I
38:59 - kind of think that you get all this
39:01 - information in your brain from seeing so
39:03 - many websites and trying to think
39:05 - critically about them and then at some
39:06 - point it's just it just kind of happens
39:09 - naturally all right it's not like it
39:12 - seems like you're just good at it but I
39:14 - don't think it's the case that people
39:16 - are just good I think it's that your
39:17 - brain gradually gets used to picking
39:21 - those things out so anyway that's just
39:23 - my my take on it all right I'm going to
39:31 - go back and do some more coding I said
39:34 - we're gonna do one more Pomodoro session
39:36 - and then then I'll answer the rest of
39:39 - the questions and let's see I will say I
39:46 - do want to give a little elaborate a
39:48 - little bit more on what I was just
39:49 - talking about especially for people who
39:51 - are just starting out I I've seen and
39:59 - maybe you all have seen this recently
40:02 - there's a like a little comic that I've
40:04 - seen online too where somebody's a
40:07 - writer there's two people talking to
40:08 - each other and the one one person is
40:11 - saying you know I how do I get to be a
40:13 - better writer like I'm still no good I
40:15 - think it's writing and maybe it's an
40:17 - artist I don't remember but he's asking
40:19 - someone more experienced and a more
40:21 - experienced person just as like just
40:23 - keep practicing and the person says well
40:25 - what I've been practicing look at all
40:27 - the stuff I've done and it shows a pile
40:29 - of work you know pile of papers and the
40:32 - other person's I think says something
40:34 - like well we'll just just keep going
40:36 - and that you see their pile and it's
40:38 - huge like you know it's it's way bigger
40:41 - than the other pile so I think it's kind
40:43 - of the same thing when it comes to
40:45 - coding it can be applied to that that
40:47 - and and I don't think it's just like a
40:52 - design thing or a front-end thing I
40:53 - think it's any area it just takes a ton
40:57 - of practice before you start to get
40:59 - really good at it and again I'm not
41:03 - claiming that I'm even at that point of
41:05 - being really good at it there's
41:07 - definitely a lot of things that I'm Way
41:08 - better at than I used to be but there's
41:12 - certainly more room for improvement and
41:15 - I always likes like sports metaphors
41:20 - sometimes are easy sometimes easier to
41:23 - think about it in terms of like a
41:25 - physical activity because the results
41:28 - are just so obvious right in front of
41:29 - you but I know they used to tell me when
41:34 - I played American football and in high
41:37 - school the more you practice so I was I
41:41 - was a quarterback and they said the more
41:43 - you throw the more you you get to see
41:45 - what's going on in the field from you
41:47 - that quarterbacks perspective things
41:49 - they'd say it would they would slow down
41:51 - right so initially like when you're
41:53 - trying to find if someone the receiver
41:55 - is open to throw the ball to it just
41:57 - looks crazy and confusing but you just
42:00 - have to do it so many times and
42:02 - eventually your brain you get so used to
42:06 - it it doesn't seem as chaotic it slows
42:09 - down right and so I think it's it's the
42:13 - same way like you look at code and it's
42:14 - not just this jumble of mess you see
42:16 - what's going on you can follow the flow
42:19 - of it you look at a website design it
42:21 - you see what should which should be
42:24 - there so anyway that was meant to be
42:30 - like somewhat encouraging that like if
42:32 - you're not there yet don't feel like
42:34 - there's something wrong with you you
42:35 - just need to keep going although I guess
42:38 - you could take it as daunting as well
42:40 - thinking like wow I'm gonna I'm gonna
42:44 - have to do the ton of work but anyway
42:49 - let's get back to this also I did have
42:55 - an issue all this morning I was working
42:57 - on this bug and I just want to share
42:59 - with you in case somebody runs into a
43:01 - similar situation maybe it'll save you a
43:03 - lot of time so I was sending form data
43:05 - to a Google sheet and then saving it in
43:10 - a spreadsheet and emailing it from there
43:12 - but what I was doing I was taking the
43:14 - form data and serializing it and then
43:17 - sending it well one of the pieces of
43:21 - data was the value of a text area and
43:24 - occasionally we wouldn't get all the
43:27 - data it would cut off in the middle of
43:29 - what someone was trying to send and
43:32 - right obviously that's a problem because
43:34 - we wouldn't get all the information that
43:35 - we needed and I could not figure it out
43:37 - and I was trying to figure out what
43:38 - browsers it was and testing on different
43:41 - browsers and trying to look things up
43:43 - couldn't find any information on text
43:46 - areas getting cut off finally I went
43:50 - back in and looked exactly at where
43:52 - everything was getting cut off and it
43:54 - was getting cut off right at a point
43:55 - where they were using and so they were
43:59 - using an ampersand and when a date is
44:03 - serialized it just dropped everything
44:05 - after that because it assumed everything
44:08 - after that was was like part of the next
44:10 - piece of data so I had actually just
44:14 - went through and before I sent it before
44:17 - I see I realized that I went through and
44:20 - changed all ampersands to two and so a
44:24 - and B and I put it in there so that was
44:28 - the fake so if anybody ever has data
44:30 - being dropped like that and you're from
44:32 - forums
44:33 - maybe it's that check check that out so
44:36 - I don't know why I never thought about
44:37 - that when I was first doing that that
44:40 - form but really glad I found it snakes
44:45 - that I had to spend so much time to find
44:46 - it but it feels good when you find out
44:49 - the solution to to a bug so anyway not
44:54 - related to this project but could be
44:57 - helpful for someone
44:58 - oops
45:00 - all right so I said something's wrong
45:04 - with this I did have this running in
45:08 - basically I had it I had it in a
45:12 - different directory so everything that I
45:15 - had done before was a branch on another
45:17 - git repo and I wanted to make it its own
45:20 - get repo so I moved basically I moved it
45:24 - over a copy and pasted a bunch of stuff
45:26 - I initialized a new git repo and then
45:28 - for whatever reason now it's not it's
45:31 - not working right so I'll have to that's
45:34 - why it did work before and we could see
45:36 - it at first but now I'll have to work on
45:43 - that okay so let's go in now what we
45:50 - need to do we need to find where the
45:53 - data is being pulled in for this header
45:56 - and where it's being pulled in for this
46:00 - as well right because it's not most of
46:06 - the stuff is not directly in that master
46:08 - template it's in one of the components
46:11 - that are being imported so we're gonna
46:14 - have to do a little bit of digging and
46:17 - this file structure is not it's not well
46:20 - organized this this file structure has
46:22 - been worked on by multiple people over
46:24 - years before I even got here and so it's
46:28 - a little bit it's a little bit crazy
46:30 - just as an example we have all these
46:38 - different configs and they're named
46:40 - original config original older config
46:44 - this is actually another copy called web
46:46 - may 7 text and it's it's a text file but
46:49 - it's just a copy of the config right so
46:52 - there's not even a standard like naming
46:55 - convention or anything so it makes it a
46:58 - little bit difficult to find things but
47:01 - at least we'll have we'll have some
47:03 - hints here because we can look at what's
47:04 - being imported here okay so main nav I
47:10 - if I had to guess I'd say main nav was
47:13 - probably
47:14 - that navbar that we're looking for let
47:16 - me know if this the font is too small
47:19 - for you I can make it bigger and let's
47:23 - see
47:35 - hmm
47:39 - we'll probably need we need to actually
47:44 - I'm not gonna bring in so I think we can
47:47 - strike a balance between things that we
47:49 - pull in that that it's data from the
47:53 - from the content management system and
47:55 - things that we can hard code in I'm not
47:57 - opposed to hard coding in this case
47:59 - because we're this is just a kind of a
48:04 - temporary thing to make the site a
48:06 - little bit more bearable until we can
48:08 - redo the site so things that are not
48:11 - likely to change like our social media
48:14 - URLs I have no problem at all hard
48:17 - coding those so could probably safely
48:20 - just get rid of this at some point hard
48:22 - code the social media links and those
48:25 - aren't gonna change but let's try to
48:30 - find this main nav and I do want to
48:32 - scroll down to the point where that nav
48:37 - comes in at to see if I want to see
48:41 - where that that slider is is is coming
48:44 - in it as well so let's scroll down a bit
48:47 - we're still at some strip things so you
48:52 - see there's a lot of different just as
48:53 - we scroll there's a lot of different
48:55 - JavaScript stuff going on things being
48:58 - being imported different places so we
49:03 - can mess around with this and try to
49:04 - move them around for you try to move
49:09 - them around a bit see if we can increase
49:12 - load of times just by maybe pulling in
49:16 - some of this stuff you down at the
49:19 - bottom
49:23 - okay all right
49:47 - okay oh and the utility now this is
49:51 - interesting so it looks like a few of
49:54 - these knobs are kind of put together so
49:57 - we may need to work on all of them okay
50:04 - so that's the top section now this is
50:06 - where
50:15 - okay all right so everything that's
50:17 - that's between the footer and the header
50:19 - is all in a difference a different
50:23 - component
50:35 - okay let's go check out that that Navin
50:44 - so we'll go to user controls main of all
50:49 - right we can look this will probably be
50:53 - faster
51:19 - there we go
51:36 - all right so I mean
51:41 - okay look say we got some jQuery going
51:43 - on at the top for the search for the
51:48 - search box which we should be able to
51:51 - get rid of most of it
52:02 - okay here we go yeah we're in the right
52:04 - spot now we can see the different the
52:10 - different links here
52:26 - actually we could see and this is kind
52:28 - of odd when I first looked at this I was
52:30 - not sure what was going on but here's
52:32 - what what happens so we can see all this
52:38 - HTML and it looks like this stuff is
52:40 - hard-coded but at some point it pulls in
52:46 - the data from the content management
52:52 - system so all this hard-coded stuff up
52:54 - here doesn't really mean anything this
52:56 - is what's important and this is
52:58 - basically our components and then props
53:02 - are getting passed in after data is
53:07 - being pulled from the content management
53:10 - system so this is what we need to worry
53:12 - about and this is what I wanted to see
53:13 - because what we want to do we're going
53:17 - to totally change you know the HTML of
53:20 - that header to make it match what we're
53:22 - doing with our header and our side nav
53:25 - so I want to be able to grab these and
53:29 - input them in and I need to figure out
53:32 - so okay that's you know what are they
53:35 - doing here obviously if this was react
53:38 - right I'd I'd be pulling in data and
53:41 - mapping over it and things like that
53:42 - well I'm not exactly sure how to do that
53:45 - and with this so it seems like we can
53:50 - use this repeater and that will loop
53:55 - through everything
54:05 - so there's definitely some stuff going
54:07 - on that I'm just like I'm not sure about
54:10 - but how do we have nested item templates
54:12 - here what does that even see so there's
54:16 - weird stuff that I'm just not not
54:18 - entirely sure what's going on with that
54:31 - Wow that is a very long string of data
54:35 - there
54:36 - [Music]
54:45 - okay I'd say what I ought to do then is
54:59 - bring in actually I'm gonna look at the
55:01 - live chat quickly to see because I know
55:02 - there's some of you that use that
55:06 - possibly could be more familiar with
55:07 - this just going to check briefly
55:29 - okay I'm there to asked if this was
55:32 - there's a repo I think I think I saw
55:36 - that somewhere now I can't find it again
55:37 - Oh a lot of this stuff isn't a private
55:44 - repo right now I can probably pull some
55:51 - of it at least some of it I think could
55:56 - be in a public repo repo yeah it would
56:01 - just have to be limited yeah I'll have
56:06 - to double check and see what just to
56:09 - make sure like you know cuz there's a
56:11 - config file and stuff in here that has
56:13 - like database passwords and things so
56:16 - I'll have to double check and see what's
56:18 - actually committed to the repo and if I
56:22 - can make it public
56:26 - also someone was talking about errors
56:34 - okay lose john john hanson saying there
56:37 - are 71 errors on that page browsers will
56:40 - have have to perform error correction
56:43 - wait there are 71 airs on tweets on this
56:49 - page 379 airs
57:01 - are we talking about something else
57:23 - okay Tom asked what is a SC X to be
57:29 - honest with you I don't know what it
57:31 - stands for but basically these are these
57:34 - are templates so if you want to think in
57:36 - JavaScript terms and react terms this is
57:39 - kind of like if you had a dot JSX file
57:42 - and I mean that's really a loose
57:43 - comparison right because I'm admittedly
57:46 - I'm not really familiar with this so I'm
57:51 - not I'm just trying to learn as much as
57:55 - I I can as much as I have to to make
57:58 - these changes so it's going to be a lot
58:00 - of trial and error but I imagine this is
58:04 - not this is not that uncommon that you
58:08 - would come into a project that was
58:10 - already existing projects kind of like a
58:13 - legacy thing and I have to work with it
58:16 - and not really have a lot of freedom to
58:19 - change things drastically so that's what
58:23 - you know that's what we're gonna have to
58:24 - do so what I want to do right here I
58:27 - think is copy and paste a bunch of this
58:31 - stuff and then
58:49 - I don't know about this search right now
59:01 - I didn't really want to bring in all
59:02 - this this jQuery but maybe I'll bring
59:09 - I'm not worried about the search right
59:10 - now I can bring that in later but let's
59:15 - let's pull in I have to find that that
59:26 - other template or was it there yeah okay
59:42 - so usually I want to pull in
59:47 - all right i need's need to format this
59:51 - it's easier to read so let's just it
59:54 - format is HTML for now okay
60:10 - okay so this is where we were pulling in
60:13 - Main Ave so let's comment that out for
60:22 - now
60:23 - and then put some of this in here and
60:31 - let's see what it does and I need to
60:33 - figure out
60:45 - I need to figure out what URL this test
60:48 - page is at
60:57 - I don't remember okay cool so we have an
61:03 - answer so ASC X is the file extension
61:07 - for asp.net or asp.net not really sure
61:12 - how you're supposed to pronounce it but
61:13 - I'm going to say ask because that seems
61:15 - like it would be faster
61:33 - says basically a scx makes it files make
61:37 - it easy to use the same code across
61:38 - multiple asp.net web pages cool alright
61:55 - let's
61:59 - I can't remember tents sorry everyone
62:12 - I cannot remember what the URL is for
62:15 - the test version of this because I made
62:19 - it in at the beginning of this year and
62:25 - I haven't been on it for a long time so
62:27 - let's see I'm gonna look it up here so
62:34 - on my other screen I'm in the content
62:36 - management system I don't want to show
62:37 - you this right now because I don't want
62:40 - to show something that shouldn't be on
62:41 - like in terms of May there might be
62:46 - content that's scheduled to be released
62:48 - that shouldn't be public yet I don't
62:53 - really know I don't use this often
62:54 - enough to even know if that's if that's
62:56 - a thing but just in case
63:11 - okay I was close
63:49 - all right cool so I got it so here's
63:53 - here's the page and you all can go to
63:54 - this this is public Franciscan ddu slash
63:58 - home test and we've got an error which
64:05 - is cool I kind of expected we get some
64:07 - air because we just copy and paste at a
64:09 - ton of stuff that to be honest with you
64:12 - I didn't completely understand anyway
64:14 - just you know million Li because of the
64:17 - syntax that I want it used to but let's
64:19 - see we're line 352 line 352 so there's
64:32 - this that's the first line that we
64:34 - actually put put this in so let's get
64:41 - rid of a lot of this stuff oops
64:50 - okay let's get rid of that since that
64:55 - was all I can see now that this looks
64:58 - like it was commented out anyway
65:07 - alright now let's see if we can figure
65:09 - out why that's not working we have
65:29 - I'd say that see
65:36 - and in case you you notice this we are
65:42 - in fact cowboy coding right now so there
65:46 - really is not a test version of this
65:48 - site
65:48 - I can't do anything about that that's
65:52 - just I know that that's that's not good
65:57 - but there's supposed to be a beta
66:01 - version of this site but unfortunately
66:04 - it shares all the same files I'm not
66:08 - really sure I think it has a different
66:12 - database but all the files are the same
66:14 - so if I go to change a file for the test
66:18 - version it also changes things on the
66:20 - live version so for our purposes we're
66:25 - editing the live version of the site and
66:27 - there's not really anything that that I
66:29 - can do about that
66:40 - okay let me check again sis's
66:54 - okay the name Chow has taxonomy does not
66:57 - exist in the current context
66:59 - alright so probably you copy something
67:07 - over whoops
67:10 - hmm I lost some other file let's split
67:14 - this
67:23 - let's check out
67:31 - there we go shrink that give us a little
67:34 - bit more space I don't think I clicked
67:44 - on the wrong thing there we go
67:49 - there actually let me see this as well
67:58 - this each dot aspx page has this dot CS
68:02 - page with it so there might be some
68:08 - things going on here yeah I think there
68:13 - are some definitely some things going on
68:15 - here that that's probably the reason why
68:22 - we're getting the airs so it's just as
68:24 - child excellent yeah there we go
68:31 - so it's not enough that I just copied
68:35 - that over because I didn't bring over
68:39 - any of this stuff and so let's see
69:00 - I think this yep if I just bring this
69:08 - over
69:15 - I wanna see if if that will work I'm
69:21 - thinking there might be some problems
69:22 - with the with the path but it's worth a
69:28 - shot
69:36 - we'll see I don't know if it'll work
69:48 - yeah I can't put two of those in there I
69:50 - may have to leave this as a separate
69:53 - component and then just edit the
69:55 - component
70:19 - yeah so what we probably should do then
70:21 - is make a test version of this nav
70:25 - component and then we probably won't
70:31 - need a test version of the the CS file
70:35 - we can just link that CS a CS file up to
70:38 - our test component and then in our our
70:42 - main test dot master we can pull in that
70:46 - component our test main nav component
70:50 - make all our changes in that otherwise
70:54 - if we try to change the main ave s CX
70:57 - right now it will change on the live
70:59 - site so I don't want to mess with that
71:02 - so let's see let's make a copy of this
71:16 - I mean that one I'm gonna rename that
71:26 - test okay so we get main nav tests and
71:32 - now we should be able to pull this in
71:35 - let's just yeah and as long as we don't
71:48 - change that tag name we won't even have
71:49 - to change it down there so we're pulling
71:51 - in we're importing like I said I don't
71:58 - really know the correct terminology but
72:00 - in terms of like react terminology I
72:02 - guess that were used to we're importing
72:04 - this main nav test component as main nav
72:08 - so we can refer to it as main nav and we
72:14 - can remove yeah yeah so glad I didn't
72:19 - take that out so you see where we're
72:24 - pulling in that main nav right there as
72:26 - the component now let's get rid of all
72:29 - this other stuff that we pulled in that
72:32 - won't work and this I mean I think that
72:36 - was we pulled that in as well
72:42 - oops no we didn't sorry okay
72:53 - there we go so let's save that shouldn't
72:57 - we shouldn't have errors now
73:06 - all right awesome okay cool so we pulled
73:09 - that in it works let's before I stop and
73:13 - answer questions I just want to verify
73:16 - that this in fact does work by changing
73:18 - something preferably something obvious
73:21 - see you can see I had already in the
73:24 - main file I've removed all the stuff
73:26 - that goes this going on down here so
73:29 - that we could build it from scratch so
73:32 - that's why there's nothing there right
73:34 - now all right so let's let's go to that
73:39 - test file and let me I'm gonna get rid
73:45 - of that so I don't accidentally change
73:49 - anything on it and our main nav test and
73:54 - we can
74:02 - let's change something
74:07 - I was hoping there was something
74:09 - hard-coded somewhere in here
74:20 - it's nice I was green background
74:25 - yeah let's just switch it okay so the
74:31 - placeholder right now says search with
74:34 - three dots let's take out the three dots
74:37 - so search you see search with three dots
74:45 - Wow these load times are gonna annoy me
74:50 - all right see now the three dots are
74:51 - gone so that works so we did pull in a
74:54 - copy of that component that's our test
74:57 - component now we can mess with it and do
74:59 - whatever we want to it and we won't have
75:01 - to worry about messing up the live site
75:04 - just to to verify let me bring over the
75:08 - live site you can see this is the
75:10 - version with the admin stuff in but you
75:15 - can see this still has the three dots so
75:18 - now we have two completely different nav
75:21 - components being used all right well
75:28 - didn't get that much done visibly but
75:31 - got a lot done in terms of just
75:33 - understanding how this works
75:35 - so that the next time we can jump in and
75:39 - just really start messing around with
75:42 - the components and pulling things in and
75:47 - you know just kind of reworking this
75:49 - page the thing we'll have to remember is
75:52 - just to make sure that we make copies
75:55 - test versions of everything and just be
75:59 - really careful that we don't edit
76:01 - directly one of the files that's being
76:04 - imported into the main live version I
76:08 - should say they're all live but into the
76:10 - version of the site that most people see
76:13 - okay let me go to the live chat now if
76:19 - you and this portion of the stream I do
76:23 - a question and answer so if you have any
76:26 - questions put them in the live chat if
76:27 - you're not interested in the
76:28 - question-and-answer session thank you so
76:33 - much for watching totally understand if
76:36 - you get other stuff you need to do
76:38 - and I'll probably be back tomorrow
76:42 - actually there's a slight chance that I
76:45 - may take time off work to work on my
76:47 - nano degree project so if I do then
76:50 - maybe I won't be back tomorrow but we'll
76:53 - see hopefully I won't have to all right
76:59 - so I'm gonna scroll back up to the place
77:01 - where I left off at in the live chat and
77:03 - I'm just gonna go down through and try
77:05 - to get to all the questions that I can
77:08 - also let me know what you all think
77:12 - about kind of this streaming this
77:14 - project in particular I don't we talked
77:17 - yesterday briefly about it I don't
77:20 - really have you know I don't have full
77:22 - control over all the projects I need to
77:24 - work on but I could try to maybe work on
77:27 - something else during the stream if you
77:30 - think that this won't be great I I mean
77:33 - it's gonna be there's definitely gonna
77:37 - be some stuff that can be applied to any
77:39 - project like when we get into you know a
77:41 - lot of the CSS and different things I
77:44 - mean that's going to be useful
77:46 - information but things that are very
77:48 - specific to this content management
77:50 - system probably won't be that useful
77:52 - since it's not really a a widely used
77:56 - system so I don't know I'm open to it
78:02 - but at this point I don't really have
78:05 - like I don't have another like from
78:07 - scratch project that we can start from
78:09 - the beginning right now I will have some
78:11 - that I'll be working on later on
78:13 - probably but probably not so like
78:18 - towards the middle of October or
78:21 - something so for now we'll see just let
78:25 - me know what you what you think and I
78:28 - can't guarantee that I can really switch
78:30 - up what I'm doing but I can I can try
78:42 - okay John Hanson says I've always been
78:46 - curious about the render blocking CSS I
78:48 - believe much of it has to do with first
78:50 - paint and above the fold content yeah
78:56 - yeah basically if you can the way I try
79:03 - to handle it sometimes is if I can I
79:06 - pull out all the CSS necessary for that
79:09 - above the fold content and I put it in a
79:14 - style tag at the head all that other CSS
79:18 - I moved to the bottom and I just import
79:21 - it in the bottom and that seems to give
79:25 - me like a really quick initial load at
79:29 - least in terms of what users will see
79:31 - you know immediately they see they both
79:33 - fold stuff the odds of them actually
79:35 - scrolling down to try to see other stuff
79:37 - that may not be loaded yet are really
79:38 - low so that's work for me it doesn't
79:41 - work on every site sometimes you know
79:44 - bigger more complex sites it's hard to
79:47 - like really get in there and look at
79:49 - your CSS by hand and pull it out but on
79:53 - small sites I've had I've had good luck
79:57 - you know doing it that way
80:08 - breanne says hey there hey how's it
80:11 - going pretty sure I remembered to say
80:13 - your name right this time let me know if
80:16 - I didn't know bear says PHP can
80:21 - dynamically resize the picture yeah I
80:25 - could do it but the up one of the other
80:28 - things is I I can't really run I I'm
80:36 - like just really limited in what I can
80:38 - do on this server so I'm not even sure
80:40 - if I could run any PHP and actually in
80:44 - fact the department that has control of
80:48 - this server someone higher up in that
80:52 - department is actually really anti PHP
80:54 - so I probably would not have permission
80:58 - to do any PHP stuff on any of their
81:01 - servers so hmm I'll recognize I don't
81:07 - know if you can hear my phone ringing I
81:09 - do not recognize the number so I'm not
81:11 - gonna answer that just probably somebody
81:13 - trying to sell me something John Hanson
81:23 - says there's just too much on that
81:24 - homepage get the virtual scissors out
81:26 - yeah for sure
81:27 - I yeah it can definitely be cut down
81:43 - how John Hanson says that is slow yes it
81:45 - is it is very slow Patrick I'm not sure
81:53 - how to pronounce the last name but it's
81:55 - a different Patrick than the other
81:57 - person that I usually refer to as
81:58 - Patrick so I'll call I'll say Patrick
82:02 - Kay Patrick Casey says what is the
82:04 - software you're using for diagnosing i'm
82:06 - on mobile can't see the name I think I
82:10 - was just in dev tools yeah we ran she
82:12 - says was dev tool so it was just chrome
82:14 - dev tools at the time
82:23 - oh cool so no beer did mention I had
82:26 - said I got a question earlier about why
82:28 - I was in incognito mode and no beer says
82:31 - it's good for like cash problems
82:34 - sometimes you can get around that by
82:37 - using incognito mode so also a good
82:41 - reason to use it
82:58 - okay so I go says Jessie I've been
83:02 - through almost two weeks in the
83:04 - university computer science I have to
83:06 - say math sucks the dropout rate is
83:08 - incredibly high we learned to code in C
83:11 - on Linux from scratch that's my
83:13 - experience over four so far Wow
83:18 - yeah that sounds that sounds rough I
83:23 - know I'm not a big fan of math math I
83:27 - can do math I got decent grades in all
83:30 - my math classes but I just wasn't happy
83:32 - doing it code in C I haven't really done
83:37 - much with C I've seen some things done
83:40 - with C it seems like seems like things
83:44 - that you take for granted in other
83:45 - programming languages you have to do
83:48 - like manually and C and that seems like
83:51 - it would be very tedious so good swears
84:00 - the best tutorial for learning chrome
84:02 - dev tools I don't know if you check out
84:07 - the chrome the google chrome Developers
84:09 - YouTube channel
84:11 - they actually have some big people who
84:13 - have worked on chrome talked about some
84:16 - of the features so I would start there
84:18 - I'm sure there are some other tutorials
84:19 - that are that are good but that's what I
84:22 - usually watch that when a new feature
84:24 - comes out I just check out what the
84:26 - chrome developers say about it I mean
84:29 - they're usually really good at
84:30 - explaining it since they built it so
84:33 - yeah I would definitely check that out
84:42 - jonbi says in response to I ghost about
84:46 - computer science and math and everything
84:48 - is math is hard but very useful to know
84:50 - as for learning see I will say that that
84:53 - will be very very useful when you get
84:55 - into learning systems programming and
84:57 - operating systems cool yep yeah I would
85:03 - say I mean definitely hang in there
85:07 - programming is programming so even if
85:10 - you learn a lot of the basic stuff on a
85:11 - language that you might not be that
85:13 - interested in or you might not you know
85:15 - see the benefit of it all the concepts
85:18 - will transfer well to any language so
85:20 - you know whatever you end up doing later
85:23 - on it won't be a waste to have learned
85:27 - you know whatever language you're
85:29 - learning in your computer science
85:31 - program and I know a lot of computer
85:33 - science programs that I've had
85:34 - experience with will teach things in
85:37 - languages that are kind of really old
85:39 - languages and at first it seems like why
85:44 - would you teach this but as I said I
85:47 - think it's getting the concepts of
85:50 - programming down problem solving things
85:52 - that's what's what's more important
85:59 - it's like I guess is having trouble with
86:03 - the calculus calculus killed me in
86:05 - college that was it was pretty rough XE
86:12 - I ended up just barely getting a B in
86:14 - that class and the teacher was very
86:16 - lenient with me in that but yeah I was a
86:20 - business major and I was in the class
86:22 - with all math majors and so that didn't
86:25 - help either that they were just they
86:26 - just got everything and we're flying
86:28 - through all the lessons and I was like I
86:30 - haven't taken a math class in five years
86:32 - uh so uh it was kind of rough
86:44 - okay all right so there's some more
86:47 - discussion about some details of
86:49 - calculus which I'm gonna skip through a
86:51 - little bit here
87:09 - and it's
87:20 - alright sunshine - sure okay I
87:25 - rearranged you had some advice for the
87:27 - era I was getting when I was trying to
87:29 - load when I was trying to run yarn and
87:32 - load all my NPM packages so thank you
87:34 - for that I'm gonna I'll try that after
87:37 - the the streams over
87:53 - let me know beer says did you work I
87:57 - mean job or do you work I mean job so
88:00 - I'm not sure if no beer is asking me or
88:03 - somebody else because I did skip through
88:04 - a bit of all that calculus stuff so I'm
88:08 - not sure so anyway no beer let me know
88:16 - I'm not sure if you were asking that who
88:22 - you were referring to in that question
88:30 - okay Antonia said good evening the text
88:33 - is too small
88:34 - oh sorry about that was it the text I'll
88:38 - have to make this text bigger I'm get
88:40 - I'm assuming that you're talking about
88:42 - the text here although I can first
88:45 - definitely think the text on this page
88:47 - was too small which I wasn't really
88:50 - worried about because the content on the
88:52 - pages doesn't really matter to what
88:54 - we're doing but yeah but let me know if
88:57 - anyone else thinks this the text here is
89:00 - too small and I can make it bigger yeah
89:07 - I'll have to met like as you all know
89:09 - who've watched before I don't use visual
89:11 - studio code often so I don't have my
89:15 - it's not really set up the way and in a
89:22 - way that's comfortable to me yet so I
89:23 - have to get used to it
89:28 - Nova glow says can you do a video
89:31 - working with SharePoint designer I don't
89:36 - know I haven't I haven't done anything
89:38 - the SharePoint before I don't foresee
89:42 - anything in the near future that I would
89:44 - need to do on there but I if there is
89:48 - then I'll try to do video on it
90:06 - okay
90:11 - betterto says I want to clone this
90:13 - project and port to port it to MVC spar
90:22 - spar will says hi everyone
90:25 - noob here hey how's it going thanks for
90:28 - watching
90:46 - okay it looks like so Umberto has been
90:48 - having a lot of trouble with the screen
90:50 - being fuzzy I'm assuming that that's
90:53 - your connection is is anybody else
90:56 - getting low quality because the the
90:58 - stream health has been good the whole
91:00 - time and yes I mean I've been outputting
91:06 - the right number of kilobits per second
91:10 - so it should be okay but let me know
91:29 - okay onk it says so are you a freelancer
91:32 - working for the university or do you
91:34 - have a full time a full day time job
91:38 - yeah I work full-time for the University
91:41 - so I am employed full time here as a
91:44 - front-end developer I do some freelance
91:46 - work as well on the side though
92:00 - so my camera froze for a while back
92:03 - there and that tone Tony says best
92:07 - freeze face I've seen for a while it's
92:11 - usually it's like mid sneeze or
92:13 - something yeah I did notice it just
92:15 - froze again I did notice that it wasn't
92:17 - a bad freeze I was like smiling and
92:19 - somewhat looking at the camera so could
92:23 - be bad
92:24 - I gotta get this camera thing fixed
92:26 - because I could definitely see it
92:28 - freezing up and me just looking really
92:31 - silly and not realizing it all right
92:39 - Umberto's says the job I'm waiting back
92:41 - on they're going to offer it to me this
92:44 - week is to convert 14 JSP and Java
92:47 - console apps to dotnet I'm so looking
92:50 - forward to that's pretty cool
92:55 - definitely that let me know how it goes
92:58 - like if if you get the job and and how
93:01 - everything goes with that I don't really
93:03 - have experience don't anything like that
93:04 - but it sounds interesting
93:20 - no BIA says you're telling that your
93:23 - connect to FileZilla or some similar
93:25 - software yes so for this particular
93:33 - project I'm not using FileZilla I
93:35 - actually I have all the files from this
93:40 - server for the website or what's the
93:45 - word
93:46 - I can't remember so basically I'll just
93:49 - I'll show you how it works
93:50 - right I it's mounted right so this
93:55 - server is mounted to my file system so I
93:59 - can just go right in there
94:01 - I even have like let me see if I can
94:05 - find it
94:06 - [Music]
94:09 - yeah so in this case like I'm in the
94:13 - file structure for this and I can just
94:18 - go right in there right for my machine
94:20 - so that's how I'm kind of in the server
94:22 - right now the downside is I can only
94:25 - work on this site when I'm on campus
94:26 - like they have it routed I don't know
94:30 - maybe just to my IP like I I can only
94:33 - access this from this computer so even
94:38 - if I'm elsewhere on campus on a laptop I
94:39 - can't can't do it so I don't like being
94:42 - limited like that but that's kind of the
94:46 - only I seriously was working here for
94:49 - like a year and a half before I was
94:52 - allowed to even have this much access so
94:54 - I'll take it
95:11 - Harshit says should I pick Redux or mob
95:13 - X I'm confused
95:16 - birdarang xu says mob x is slightly
95:19 - easier than redux but redux is more
95:21 - popular yeah I I would agree with that
95:27 - from what I've from what I've seen from
95:30 - using redux and from tutorials on mob X
95:32 - I think mob X is a little bit easier
95:42 - okay Umberto says he just got to the ass
95:46 - pronunciation it says it still
95:49 - pronounced as it as its acronym as far
95:51 - as I can tell
95:52 - ASP but I would just stick to calling it
95:55 - dotnet alright I'll just I'll try to
95:57 - remember that and just call it dotnet
95:59 - from now on all right it's always hard
96:02 - about pronunciation when you work by I
96:05 - mean I basically work alone most of the
96:07 - time so I only read normally about how
96:11 - to pronounce things unless I can find
96:12 - somebody on YouTube that says it so I
96:15 - just kind of the first time you read it
96:18 - you got to decide in your head well how
96:20 - am I gonna pronounce this thing and
96:21 - that's usually what what sticks
96:44 - a Peter S Mac versus windows I'll say
96:49 - this is my answer for the operating
96:52 - system question I develop on a Mac my
96:57 - servers or Linux and I game on a PC or
97:01 - on a Windows computer so that's that's
97:05 - how I feel about about operating systems
97:16 - okay Harshit says any plans for review
97:19 - I'm getting into it nowadays I don't
97:23 - have any plans to review right now I'm
97:26 - interested in it if you want to learn
97:28 - more about view I would check out
97:31 - there's a series that we just did here
97:33 - free code camp not me I mean but Cody
97:37 - does videos and he just did I think it's
97:44 - like a five-part series I think there
97:45 - are five parts there might act there
97:47 - might end up being more than that of
97:49 - building something in view from the very
97:52 - beginning all the way through so I would
97:55 - check that out I haven't watched it yet
97:59 - but it seems like it's getting a lot of
98:02 - views and a lot of thumbs up and stuff
98:04 - so it seems like it's it's been well
98:06 - received so far
98:23 - Harshit says do you use zsh in your
98:26 - terminal no I just have the the Bosch
98:35 - just use Bosch for the terminal I mean
98:40 - like my terminal client is I turned 2
98:43 - but in terms of like my probe profile
98:49 - and everything I think that's what
98:50 - you're asking so let me know if it's not
98:54 - haha John B says oh the great
98:56 - pronunciation words I'm still a fan of
98:58 - the ever looming war of SQL vs sequel I
99:04 - prefer sequel when it comes to that
99:07 - unless or why I prefer sequel but I
99:10 - usually do say sequel but I hear SQL a
99:13 - lot yeah I don't know why we worry so
99:21 - much about pronouncing these acronyms
99:23 - like does it really matter and as long
99:29 - as you know what the other person is
99:31 - talking about I don't I don't know that
99:33 - it matters all right well I've gotten to
99:38 - the bottom of the live chat if I happen
99:40 - to miss your question I apologize you
99:43 - can send me a message on Twitter or
99:46 - comment on the video or something and
99:48 - I'll try to get to your question I
99:52 - should be back tomorrow like I said
99:57 - there's a chance that I may not stream
99:59 - tomorrow and I may be working on my my
100:02 - Redux project so yeah oh I may be
100:09 - working on it it's given me a lot of
100:11 - trouble so far so hopefully hopefully a
100:16 - tomorrow I can stream and say hey I
100:18 - finished my project and I turned it in
100:19 - so the chances of that right now don't
100:22 - seem really good but I can hope right so
100:27 - I'll be back probably tomorrow I'll let
100:30 - you know I'll send out a tweet tomorrow
100:31 - and I'll schedule the stream
100:33 - as early as I can so you get two
100:34 - notifications on YouTube if you're
100:36 - subscribed but until then have a great
100:42 - day and thanks for so much thank you so
100:44 - much for watching and contributing in
100:47 - the live chat and I really appreciate it
