00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse
00:08 - today we're going to continue on with
00:10 - what we were doing last week
00:12 - and that's adding routes and components
00:16 - to our react site
00:18 - and we're going to be creating some more
00:20 - graphql queries
00:23 - so a lot of the same stuff
00:28 - we'll have we'll have a lot of new
00:31 - content uh so i've been working on
00:33 - migrating some content over so i think i
00:35 - have maybe like four
00:37 - new custom post types and a couple of
00:39 - new taxonomies so
00:42 - um i'll try to
00:44 - do front end work on the stream
00:47 - and then do the data migration stuff on
00:50 - my own
00:52 - and that way we'll always have new
00:55 - new content to try to set up on the on
00:57 - the front-end side of things
01:00 - so i hope everyone had a good weekend
01:03 - and
01:04 - hey
01:05 - i see you on the live chat
01:09 - i um
01:11 - i was recently doing some reading about
01:13 - obs which is what i used to stream and
01:16 - i've changed the settings and i managed
01:18 - to get the cpu
01:19 - um
01:22 - usage
01:24 - down i think like by a third
01:28 - so let me know if the video quality
01:31 - seems okay i don't want to drop
01:33 - everything down too much i should still
01:35 - get 1080p
01:37 - and
01:38 - we shouldn't have any issues with
01:40 - stuttering uh and or dropping frames or
01:43 - anything
01:45 - uh so
01:47 - hopefully it all works out right
01:50 - uh but so far
01:52 - it looks like this is this would be the
01:54 - right setting
01:59 - all right so
02:01 - let me
02:03 - let me switch over to show my screen
02:09 - okay
02:10 - let's move this down a bit
02:12 - and increase the size here
02:19 - all right so just a refresher
02:23 - and also if you're new to the stream
02:25 - i break the stream up into 25 minute
02:29 - segments
02:30 - and i'll try to do some coding for 25
02:33 - minutes
02:33 - and then i will take a five minute break
02:36 - go to the live chat answer as many
02:38 - questions as i can in that five minute
02:40 - break
02:41 - and then we'll do some more code
02:44 - and then at the very end
02:46 - i answer all the questions in the live
02:47 - chat so the streams usually aren't
02:50 - longer than two hours
02:52 - sometimes they're
02:53 - only about an hour
02:56 - but if you uh if you do ask a question
02:58 - please be patient and i will get to it
03:00 - eventually if you can't stick around you
03:02 - can always check out the recording all
03:04 - the recordings of these streams are
03:06 - available on the free code camp youtube
03:08 - channel
03:11 - all right cool it looks like uh
03:15 - you all have noticed that the fans
03:17 - aren't running yeah it's really quiet in
03:19 - here now
03:21 - it's amazing it's like
03:24 - i never really noticed how noisy it was
03:25 - until
03:27 - until now i can't hear the fans at all
03:32 - that's pretty wild
03:35 - all right so hopefully the audio is a
03:38 - little better for you all as well
03:42 - and i really i didn't even realize it
03:44 - was that bad
03:48 - okay
03:50 - so today
03:52 - let me
03:58 - all right let me give you i'm trying to
04:00 - figure out where we left off
04:03 - so we left off with department pages it
04:05 - looks like
04:09 - so here's basically kind of what we've
04:11 - been doing uh in case you haven't seen
04:13 - the streams or you missed some
04:15 - we create
04:16 - new pages right so we're using react and
04:20 - in particular we're using next js and
04:23 - next has its own routing system but
04:25 - we're kind of you know adding our own
04:27 - routing on top of that
04:29 - so within this pages folder
04:31 - we'll create a new page
04:33 - and then we'll also create a new query
04:36 - for graphql
04:39 - and we'll create a new route in our
04:41 - server.js file
04:43 - and once we complete that process
04:46 - then there'll be a whole new section
04:48 - of the site that'll be available
04:51 - to pull in content so
04:53 - we've already completed that for several
04:56 - sections so we have a section for
04:58 - faculty members a section for
05:01 - academic majors
05:02 - we also have a section now for academic
05:04 - departments
05:06 - so we're going to continue on today
05:08 - and some of the things that i brought in
05:12 - since then are we have
05:15 - um
05:17 - associates degrees which i don't think
05:19 - i'm finished bringing all the data so we
05:21 - might skip that uh as well as miners
05:26 - and
05:27 - we have institutes and
05:31 - organizations i think it's institutional
05:33 - organizations i just shortened it to
05:35 - institutes for api purposes
05:38 - and then we have some staff members
05:41 - i also brought in
05:43 - a bunch of videos
05:45 - as a custom post type
05:48 - but i can't really do anything with
05:49 - those yet i'm going to need someone to
05:51 - go in manually and sort through those
05:54 - and then assign them to a category so
05:56 - that we can pull them in uh to places
05:59 - where we need them
06:01 - so basically that's just
06:02 - like a youtube embed tag
06:05 - inside a wordpress custom post type
06:10 - all right so let's pull in
06:16 - let's see
06:18 - let's go with miners for now
06:21 - okay that's all that minor agreement
06:25 - yeah
06:26 - let's go with miners so the first thing
06:28 - that i want to do is i want to go to the
06:30 - current website and i want to check what
06:33 - the url is because we need to match that
06:35 - with our route wherever possible we're
06:38 - going to keep urls from the old url to
06:39 - the new one which i probably should
06:42 - mention for those of you who are new
06:45 - we're taking an old website
06:48 - for the university the main university
06:50 - website uh here at franciscan university
06:52 - and we're making a completely new
06:54 - website but we need to migrate the
06:55 - content and we want to keep the urls the
06:57 - same wherever possible alright obviously
07:00 - because i'm sure there's a lot of
07:03 - inbound links and things that will break
07:06 - if we mess up the url structure
07:09 - obviously would not be good for seo as
07:12 - well
07:13 - because i'm sure we'll still show up in
07:15 - a lot of search results
07:17 - for urls that are now broken
07:20 - and then as soon as the search engine
07:22 - realizes that we will drop out of the
07:24 - search results
07:28 - so it's very important that we double
07:30 - check these
07:33 - oops wrong site
07:38 - there we are
07:41 - see how long it takes today to load
07:45 - so from the load times alone it should
07:47 - be obvious why we need to build a new
07:48 - website
07:52 - wow and this website is actually hosted
07:56 - on campus so it's
07:59 - just maybe
08:02 - i don't know less
08:05 - maybe like
08:06 - less than a mile
08:08 - um
08:10 - maybe a kilometer i'm less probably less
08:13 - than where i am right now
08:16 - it's insane that it takes that long to
08:18 - get here
08:19 - uh okay so we need to find our
08:23 - miners
08:24 - undergraduate
08:26 - uh another thing that i'd like to do
08:30 - if possible is kind of
08:33 - you figure out where people are going
08:34 - the most and where people want to go
08:36 - based on analytics
08:37 - and
08:38 - then make those sections very easy to
08:42 - get to
08:43 - so we should have a section for miners
08:45 - there we are
08:47 - so let's check out our minor programs
08:49 - and see hopefully we have some
08:51 - consistency with the urls
08:53 - if not we may have to
08:56 - you know take another
08:59 - oh
09:03 - studies
09:04 - creek
09:09 - closed captioning not available
09:24 - hmm
09:29 - all right this is going to be tough
09:33 - so it's probably hard for you all to see
09:35 - what the urls just were because they're
09:37 - so small
09:40 - um
09:41 - let me all right i see
09:44 - you are asking for ngrok i already
09:46 - started the server i just forgot to
09:48 - paste it so here's the
09:53 - here's the link for the ngrok server
09:58 - you can click that and check out the
10:00 - site as we as we make it
10:03 - worlds asks what is
10:05 - is this what people call migrations
10:08 - um
10:14 - uh
10:15 - migration i mean we're migrating data
10:18 - we're moving the
10:19 - yeah i mean i guess we're migrating
10:22 - we have to migrate the data
10:25 - uh from one database
10:28 - to another so that we can use a
10:29 - different content management system
10:33 - oh goodness okay so let me explain to
10:36 - you what is messed up about these urls
10:38 - right now
10:39 - so here's all our miners
10:43 - like legal studies for instance
10:47 - is just franciscan.edu legal studies
10:50 - but then
10:52 - classical latin is
10:54 - franciscan.edu classics slash classical
10:57 - latin
11:00 - so there's not really consistency this
11:02 - one is kind of the odd one out
11:04 - because it's formatted like this all the
11:06 - other ones are formatted based on the
11:09 - the department
11:11 - um or the the major
11:13 - program this is probably the department
11:17 - oh no but so franciscan studies is just
11:20 - franciscan.edu franciscan studies
11:24 - all right
11:25 - this is going to be more difficult so i
11:28 - guess here's what we'll need to do
11:30 - for the ones that are
11:34 - just straight up like dot edu slash
11:37 - something we're gonna have to create
11:39 - their own routes
11:41 - to keep the url
11:43 - the same
11:45 - but then we're going to need to
11:52 - i don't know we're going to need to
11:54 - figure out an alternate route
11:56 - so we want to keep the old urls but then
11:59 - within the site we want to
12:01 - keep things really logical and clean
12:04 - so i'm going to need your help just
12:06 - thinking through this
12:07 - would it be more logical to make all the
12:10 - miners have let's say franciscan.edu
12:14 - minor
12:15 - slash
12:17 - classical latin or whatever
12:20 - or would it make more sense to have it
12:23 - franciscan.edu
12:26 - classics which would be the department
12:28 - name slash classical latin
12:31 - let me know if that
12:32 - question even makes sense at all to you
12:35 - and then let me know what you think
12:38 - i'm just
12:48 - yeah i'm just kind of wondering
12:53 - so i think we do we we are making the
12:55 - majors let's look at our our router for
12:57 - a second oops
13:00 - where are we at
13:01 - our server.js file here
13:05 - right now what we have going on is
13:09 - yeah so
13:11 - we have like these kind of routes for
13:13 - our majors but then we're also
13:16 - making a route
13:18 - and this will be kind of our new
13:20 - structure that we're going to encourage
13:22 - is major slash
13:24 - and then the id for the major
13:45 - okay so it looks like a few years saying
13:48 - to do department slash program
13:51 - is a better way to do things
13:54 - okay
13:58 - okay let's go let me go back here and
14:04 - and let's see
14:07 - classic streak minor okay the um
14:15 - the slug actually
14:17 - with some of them
14:20 - already says miner in it i think that's
14:22 - not a bad idea to keep it
14:26 - to keep the name of miner in there so
14:30 - just i just want to double check and
14:31 - make sure that these are linking to
14:33 - pages that's just for the miner okay
14:35 - good
14:36 - so film studies minor
14:40 - okay
14:55 - uh stephen says i can't get the ngrok
14:57 - site open
14:59 - is anyone else having trouble with the
15:00 - ngrok site
15:08 - uh let's see
15:10 - jeff said it opened
15:12 - uh on his phone but not on the
15:15 - workstation
15:18 - it could be the firewall
15:22 - all right let me know uh what's going on
15:25 - with that
15:26 - you try to copy and paste the link as
15:28 - well because sometimes um
15:32 - links with uh with youtube are
15:36 - are weird like in the live chat
15:50 - okay
15:51 - all right so
15:52 - i'm going to take one last check at all
15:54 - these suggestions before we actually
15:56 - create the route
15:59 - michael's saying we could do department
16:01 - and then program and then major or minor
16:14 - okay
16:16 - maybe we could
16:23 - yeah maybe we could do that let me
16:27 - let's see
16:28 - access biology department commercial
16:30 - theology classic social classes
16:32 - political science all right yeah so
16:34 - these are already categorized under
16:36 - department i suppose
16:37 - so for now let's go with um slash
16:40 - department slash
16:43 - and then we'll put the name of
16:49 - the the program the name of the miner
16:56 - okay
16:58 - yeah we'll do it like that
17:05 - and that will actually match up with the
17:06 - current way of doing things so that's
17:08 - okay
17:09 - for some of them
17:14 - we'll have to
17:17 - account for the the current url and then
17:20 - also
17:21 - direct things into the new system
17:26 - okay
17:27 - there's also maybe some changes um
17:31 - restructuring like departments and
17:33 - things so
17:35 - i don't think any of those changes will
17:37 - happen before the site launches
17:42 - but
17:43 - i guess it it wouldn't
17:45 - it would be almost
17:46 - a little bit of a waste to i suppose
17:49 - overthink this
17:51 - because it it's likely that it may
17:53 - change at some point this year
17:57 - um
17:58 - i like i don't know anything for sure
18:00 - but i've just heard that's a possibility
18:02 - so
18:04 - we may have a different organization i i
18:06 - would hate i i really wish that
18:09 - i could know for sure how that's going
18:10 - to play out before we made these because
18:14 - it could mess up the organization of all
18:17 - the academic stuff on the site but
18:19 - oh well we'll do what we need to do for
18:21 - now
18:23 - okay so let's go to our code
18:26 - and let's try to set up some routes here
18:29 - so i'm going to grab this for now
18:33 - and
18:34 - let's see department
18:37 - department
18:39 - list
18:49 - okay i see now what i was trying to do
18:51 - and i just never finished that okay
18:54 - um
18:56 - so what we'll need is
19:08 - um
19:14 - actually i'm not sure how i'm gonna do
19:15 - this
19:17 - all right let me let me think through
19:18 - this with y'all
19:19 - um
19:21 - so basically we need a double
19:25 - parameterized route
19:27 - so we would need something like
19:31 - i don't know
19:33 - id1
19:37 - you know so it would basically like the
19:39 - department and then
19:42 - you know the id for the
19:46 - miner
19:47 - um
19:49 - but here's the problem with that we have
19:54 - you know this isn't the only place where
19:56 - we have
19:57 - this type of thing happening
20:09 - all right let me know if if anybody
20:13 - first like if you see the issue too or
20:15 - if i'm just
20:16 - like missing something big here let me
20:19 - think about this for a second
21:05 - all right
21:08 - i think
21:11 - i think we need to go back and just do
21:13 - do it like this
21:20 - and now it makes more sense why i did
21:22 - this with the major because i think
21:24 - that's really our only
21:27 - our only option so
21:34 - yeah there's just not
21:38 - i just don't know of a way to do kind of
21:41 - like a double
21:42 - variable here
21:45 - and to have that work out
21:50 - essentially because we're units we're
21:53 - dealing with a lot of different custom
21:55 - post types
22:01 - so like right now a lot of our pages
22:03 - were directing these two are very very
22:05 - similar but they're not always going to
22:06 - be similar they're going to have
22:07 - different things so it's like
22:12 - what would i direct this to would i have
22:14 - to keep
22:17 - i don't know lists of
22:20 - all the different names of the
22:21 - department so it's if
22:23 - one of these names is the department
22:26 - and then if one of these names is a
22:28 - minor
22:29 - then we send it to
22:31 - the minor route
22:36 - so i
22:38 - i don't know i think this would be it
22:40 - whether or not this is the ideal url i
22:42 - think this is really our only logical
22:44 - option at this point
22:47 - i i don't think it's
22:51 - for one thing it will keep our url
22:53 - shorter
22:55 - um
22:58 - yeah i we're just gonna we're gonna have
23:00 - to really try to make sure that all our
23:02 - urls can fit in in this type of thing
23:04 - where we just have like the descriptor
23:07 - like category
23:08 - and then
23:11 - we have
23:12 - you know with the the variable the
23:14 - parameterized route would be
23:16 - i think we can do that
23:20 - um
23:23 - let's see
23:25 - michael says uh the issue is that
23:27 - whoever initially set up the site didn't
23:28 - make a standard and have everyone stick
23:30 - to it
23:31 - yeah i mean that's that's kind of like
23:33 - what happened
23:34 - uh part of the issue too i think is
23:38 - at i don't know the full history and i
23:41 - didn't work with this site that much but
23:43 - there was some functionality that the
23:45 - site was supposed to have that then
23:47 - didn't have
23:48 - um and then various things
23:51 - just quit working during the time the
23:53 - site was there so
23:55 - some things were done that
23:57 - wasn't really part of the plan but it
23:59 - had to be done just to get pages up
24:02 - and i think that's part of the reason
24:04 - why there's so much
24:05 - weirdness also
24:07 - i i know there's been a lot of different
24:09 - people working on it student workers and
24:10 - things like that so it hasn't been
24:14 - hasn't been one person working on it and
24:16 - i guess
24:18 - there hasn't really been enforcement of
24:20 - a strict standard for things
24:23 - it's possible that reorganization has
24:26 - happened as well like maybe some things
24:28 - are categorized
24:30 - used to be categorized differently
24:33 - i don't know
24:36 - um nick says do you need something like
24:38 - a nested resource like slash department
24:40 - slash department id slash minor such
24:42 - minor id
24:55 - yeah actually
24:57 - would that work
25:00 - all right let me paste this in and see
25:02 - what you all think i think it's gonna
25:04 - end up making really long urls but you
25:07 - all let me know
25:09 - if you think it would be better
25:12 - so
25:13 - what if we had instead of minor id we
25:16 - would have department
25:18 - and then
25:20 - whatever the department name is and then
25:22 - minor and whatever the minor name is
25:25 - that might work
25:27 - i'm i'm not sure we could try it
25:30 - but i'm not even gonna try it if you
25:31 - think that's gonna end up getting
25:32 - ridiculous
25:51 - all right a few of you kind of came in
25:53 - and said hello hey everybody that just
25:55 - came in
25:57 - um
26:00 - all right i'm gonna give everybody just
26:02 - a few seconds to
26:05 - think about that and let me know
26:11 - hmm
26:12 - let me just put it in here for now
26:15 - and comment it out
26:17 - because
26:19 - even if we don't use it right now
26:21 - i do
26:22 - i like that we
26:24 - that that's a possibility if we end up
26:26 - finding a case where we have to do
26:28 - something like that
26:30 - what the heck is this trailing space is
26:32 - not allowed
26:33 - there we are
26:35 - um
26:37 - okay
26:39 - all right in any case what we can do
26:41 - right now
26:43 - is
26:44 - we can make
26:47 - a component
26:49 - and we can make our graphql query
27:04 - michael cruz says can't you override the
27:06 - actual url in the route
27:10 - um i'm not i'm not exactly sure what
27:13 - you're referring to um
27:19 - the the thing is so
27:23 - um
27:27 - i need
27:29 - wait how do i do this
27:42 - wait
27:44 - uh michael
27:47 - oh man um
27:50 - you just reminded me
27:53 - so the issue is i need to be able to
27:56 - grab
27:57 - the url as it currently is and direct it
28:01 - to the right place
28:08 - and if i can't do that
28:12 - then we're just gonna
28:13 - we're gonna have to break the urls and
28:15 - we can't do anything about it so
28:17 - essentially i need to be able to do this
28:21 - where it's like
28:29 - so i need to be able to do this and then
28:31 - i also need to be able to just grab
28:37 - and i mean i could always
28:39 - there's not that many miners so
28:41 - potentially i could just hard code
28:45 - what's in there
28:55 - i'd hate to do that but i
28:57 - i'm gonna end up with so many things
28:59 - hard-coded
29:04 - i just i don't really see any way around
29:05 - it
29:08 - especially when we don't have
29:09 - consistency with with urls
29:14 - tomorrow's film studies
29:31 - so this like i'm gonna have to have like
29:33 - stuff like this
29:41 - uh jeff says try utilizing the web
29:43 - server to
29:45 - do the rewrite for the incoming request
29:52 - i mean i i could
29:55 - well i think we're still going to have
29:56 - the same thing though is i'm going to
29:58 - have to have a ton of of rewrites
30:04 - so i mean whether it's here or whether
30:07 - it's in the web server which will be
30:10 - um
30:13 - well we're going to use nginx as a
30:16 - reverse proxy so
30:19 - either way we're just going to have to
30:20 - have a list
30:31 - all right
30:49 - all right so here's
30:55 - here's what i'm going to do so i will
30:56 - have this
31:02 - minor and then
31:06 - our id and then that is going to send it
31:08 - to the component that's minor but then
31:10 - we'll also have this sort of thing it's
31:12 - going to send that to the component
31:14 - that's minor but then we're going to
31:15 - manually give it the id of
31:21 - film studies
31:23 - well as a string
31:31 - uh jeff says i would
31:33 - put the rewrite rules at the web server
31:36 - side keeps this code cleaner
31:41 - uh harsha says maybe do those using a
31:43 - loop
31:44 - uh to save some time
31:47 - um
31:48 - we could how about
31:52 - all right so here's what i think about
31:53 - that one yes i'm definitely open to
31:56 - cleaning this up somehow loops or
31:58 - whatever
32:00 - to clean things up
32:02 - or potentially like what we probably
32:04 - should do at the very least is just get
32:06 - this stuff out of here and put it in a
32:08 - separate file
32:11 - i'm also open to
32:14 - redoing this in
32:18 - for for like nginx
32:20 - for now though
32:22 - i'm going to do them here just so that i
32:24 - can see what i'm i'm working with
32:26 - and then that way they'll at least be in
32:28 - a place so that later on i won't forget
32:30 - what i was trying to do so as long as we
32:32 - have one example
32:34 - or at least one example for each type of
32:37 - url that's currently being used on the
32:38 - site
32:40 - that should be enough we don't have to
32:41 - type them all out right now
32:43 - uh we just need to
32:45 - have one example make sure it works and
32:47 - then we can move on to the next type
32:50 - uh hey everybody i have a few people
32:52 - saying hi coming in uh den antonio
32:56 - dallet and inna hey how's it going
33:02 - all right so
33:05 - all right let's move forward so i think
33:07 - the
33:08 - suggestions are good and i think we
33:10 - should do them for right now though i'm
33:12 - gonna do it like this and then
33:16 - once we get a better idea of the scale
33:18 - of everything then that should give us
33:19 - um
33:22 - a better idea of like what would be the
33:24 - best way to clean this whole thing up
33:26 - and to do it differently so
33:28 - for now that's what i'm going to do i'm
33:30 - just going to try to comment things and
33:31 - make it obvious what what these things
33:33 - are so that when we come back we can
33:36 - easily see like all the the groups here
33:45 - all right so we have that route in there
33:48 - we need a component
33:55 - new file
33:58 - miner
34:11 - it's really possible that some of these
34:13 - like major and minor really don't need
34:15 - their own post types
34:35 - okay
34:38 - so this is actually
34:41 - i mean this component is done
34:44 - for now
34:48 - assuming that we're getting similar
34:50 - content that we do for majors that's
34:52 - done
34:54 - so if you want to check more of this out
34:56 - about what's going on uh check out the
34:58 - repo the links available in
35:04 - in the description of this video
35:07 - and now we'll go to the queries we're
35:10 - going to make a new file
35:12 - i'm going to say
35:14 - miner.js
35:17 - as a query and we can grab the major
35:21 - query
35:23 - and we're going to do the same thing
35:25 - here
35:26 - whoops
35:27 - did not copy that
35:32 - copy
35:36 - paste there we are
35:38 - and so now
35:40 - let's change this
35:45 - minor and then
35:50 - miners where name id content select okay
35:54 - wonderful
35:55 - all right so now we have our query uh
35:59 - what did i do
36:04 - i don't know what i did there and i
36:06 - messed it up don't save that
36:09 - put it there save that major one needs
36:13 - to be deleted
36:18 - okay
36:19 - let's make sure i didn't mess that one
36:21 - up
36:22 - all right that looks good
36:28 - okay so let me try this
36:35 - um so we should be able to go to
36:42 - minor
36:43 - and then
36:45 - actually i need to see what the slugs
36:46 - are
36:47 - for these
36:48 - um let's see greek minor what's our slug
36:53 - okay
37:00 - oops
37:03 - i don't think i restarted the server and
37:05 - i also don't remember exactly
37:09 - okay we did say minor
37:13 - okay
37:14 - um
37:16 - let's restart this
37:28 - do
37:39 - there we are
37:40 - okay cool so we have greek minor
37:43 - classics department little text here
37:47 - um some of the courses wonderful okay
37:49 - cool
37:50 - so
37:51 - our data is being brought in properly
37:54 - from our content management system which
37:56 - is wordpress we wrote a graphql query
37:58 - that's bringing in the data that we need
38:00 - and then we're displaying it
38:02 - with our react component
38:04 - here on the site
38:06 - okay looks good
38:10 - i mean it looks it looks adequate right
38:12 - it's super plain right now
38:14 - um but in terms of being able to pull
38:16 - the data that's good
38:18 - uh okay
38:22 - okay let me check
38:25 - two things one i never took my timer so
38:28 - i never started my timer so let me just
38:31 - check the time
38:34 - oh yeah i'm definitely due to go back to
38:35 - the live chat here all right so let me
38:37 - go to the live chat right now then the
38:39 - second thing i was gonna say is let me
38:41 - check the live chat so
38:42 - uh i'm gonna go to the live chat
38:44 - let me take i am going to start my timer
38:47 - now
38:48 - and i'm going to put it on five minutes
38:51 - and
38:53 - go through as much as i can on the live
38:55 - chat
39:07 - hey rowan's here burlings has finally
39:09 - joined after so long yeah i haven't seen
39:11 - you around for a while how's everything
39:13 - going
39:27 - uh world's asked is ngrok is the ingroup
39:29 - website the new website you're rerouting
39:32 - to uh the ngrok just uh
39:37 - yeah that's just a way for you to open
39:39 - the site on your machine and see
39:42 - what we're doing as we're doing it i
39:44 - mean you could go navigate wherever you
39:45 - want on the site inspect it in devtools
39:48 - and when i change something then it
39:50 - automatically would change for you as
39:52 - well
40:17 - um
40:19 - i'm scrolling through looking for a
40:20 - question there's a lot of comments about
40:22 - our routing options
40:47 - all right so michael's saying the loops
40:49 - don't scale well make an array and then
40:52 - do index of of the array okay that
40:56 - with harsh says with loops only seven to
40:58 - eight um
41:00 - lines can do the thing
41:03 - um
41:04 - niki's here hey how's it going
41:06 - says hey everyone just got back
41:09 - um from
41:13 - physio in english i think
41:17 - i'm not sure
41:19 - are you trying to say like your your
41:20 - normal like doctor's appointment stuff i
41:22 - think anyway welcome welcome back
41:32 - this person's handle on youtube is
41:33 - display block i like that
41:36 - um
41:37 - it says hello what time do you study to
41:40 - reach this level of coding
41:42 - um
41:44 - i have been
41:47 - i mean i've been doing this
41:49 - for like five years
41:56 - sorry
41:58 - ah
41:59 - oh i just got so drowsy all of a sudden
42:03 - um
42:04 - yeah so i it all
42:07 - it's so hard to estimate really it just
42:09 - depends on your situation like how many
42:11 - hours a day can you study
42:12 - um
42:13 - you know how good are you retaining new
42:15 - information
42:17 - you know what your background is before
42:19 - that
42:20 - there's just so much so
42:23 - it's going to be different for everyone
42:24 - i would say though
42:26 - if you're just getting into coding like
42:28 - don't expect to be able to do everything
42:30 - in a few weeks right don't don't get
42:32 - discouraged that's unrealistic
42:34 - expectations so you know don't think
42:36 - it's going to take you years and years
42:38 - to get you know good enough to to build
42:40 - anything meaningful
42:42 - you know but at the same time
42:46 - um you know be realistic
42:48 - uh so i guess there's like
42:50 - two two different
42:51 - places you don't really want to be at
42:53 - you don't want to be you know thinking
42:55 - that you're going to learn everything
42:56 - really fast and then get disappointed
42:58 - when it doesn't happen and then you also
43:00 - don't want to be
43:02 - thinking that there's no way you'll ever
43:03 - be able to do it right so be realistic
43:06 - with that i mean i i i see both things
43:09 - with like you know people that ask me
43:10 - questions is
43:12 - you know some some people expect like
43:14 - i'm going to be able to do everything
43:15 - right away and then some people are like
43:18 - you know i've only been coding for
43:21 - you know so many months there's no way
43:23 - anybody will ever hire me
43:25 - right i don't think either one is really
43:26 - true
43:29 - uh so just kind of
43:32 - you know be realistic about that but in
43:33 - terms of your specific question i it's
43:36 - it's really nearly impossible to give a
43:38 - timeline for how long it would take to
43:41 - get to a certain point
43:49 - all right harshet's giving some examples
43:51 - of things that i could do
43:55 - to clean up that code for all the routes
43:57 - so thank you for that
44:06 - um
44:08 - no life says hi how are you uh not bad
44:11 - not bad how you doing
44:15 - all right i only have just a few more
44:16 - things in the live chat so even though
44:17 - my timer went off i'm gonna answer a few
44:20 - uh just so i can
44:22 - get everything in here before we start
44:24 - up with coding again
44:27 - um
44:29 - the the lathe says do you have eslint
44:32 - setup and in that case which rule setup
44:34 - do you use
44:36 - um
44:37 - we follow
44:39 - standard js i think we're using
44:42 - that's what we usually use for the
44:44 - project so the standard js rules
44:50 - andrew says how do you get started on
44:51 - big projects like this i'm looking to
44:53 - get into react
44:54 - how do i get started um
44:58 - i don't i we just
45:01 - you start like you start every project
45:02 - and you just keep you break it down into
45:05 - small chunks and then just keep going
45:07 - every day and getting things done
45:09 - um
45:11 - that's that's about it
45:21 - uh stephen says jesse how often do you
45:24 - use loops like for if 4h in your job
45:28 - um
45:29 - we
45:30 - use loops a lot uh sometimes i don't use
45:33 - like a for loop as much and
45:37 - i'll try to use
45:40 - like a dot map or something like that or
45:43 - filter or sort if i can i like using
45:45 - those better
46:01 - uh stephen says i'm spending a lot like
46:03 - a lot on javascript loops and i worry
46:06 - that i won't use it to the level that
46:07 - i'm working with it
46:10 - yeah um
46:13 - hey
46:14 - being able to do loops and having that
46:16 - concept down i mean it it's important
46:19 - uh you will probably use loops or
46:21 - something like a loop
46:23 - frequently
46:34 - uh steven's asking about dot map
46:37 - yeah i i really do think dot map is
46:40 - easier
46:42 - to write it
46:46 - i don't know like for
46:48 - i don't know if dot map is easier to
46:49 - reason about i mean when you can see
46:52 - like a for loop like you can see the
46:55 - how it's gonna increment in things so
46:59 - i don't know it uh it might be easier to
47:02 - see how it's
47:03 - how it's gonna work
47:05 - but once you get familiar with map and
47:09 - um like filter and things like that
47:12 - i do think it's easier
47:21 - all right nikki says
47:22 - those array helpers are all things you
47:24 - can do with a basic for loop they are
47:26 - just written shorter your understanding
47:28 - of the basic for loop will surely help
47:32 - yeah
47:33 - i agree i completely agree i think
47:35 - that's a good answer
47:36 - all right last question then we go back
47:38 - to the code anna says how often do you
47:40 - visit the gym
47:42 - uh i actually have some workout
47:44 - equipment in my basement at home
47:46 - so i just do that i haven't been to like
47:49 - an actual
47:50 - gym and
47:52 - i don't know
47:53 - maybe it's been
47:56 - over a year
47:58 - i think it's yeah it's definitely been
48:00 - over a year
48:02 - um so i have
48:04 - i have an exercise bike i have like a a
48:08 - bench you know bench press some weights
48:10 - some like free weights and things so
48:14 - um i could do like a full body workout
48:17 - um
48:19 - so not quite as
48:21 - as nice as having like all the different
48:24 - options that you have at a gym but it's
48:25 - definitely convenient to be able to just
48:28 - you know roll out of bed and go right
48:30 - into uh
48:31 - right into a workout
48:35 - so for now i i really like that
48:38 - i mean it i can actually get into
48:40 - there's a gym on campus here where i
48:42 - work
48:43 - uh so
48:44 - it's it's pretty nice they have um you
48:47 - know all your standard stuff you'd see
48:49 - in any gym and
48:51 - um
48:52 - it was like rack i used to go and play
48:53 - racquetball before work with a co-worker
48:56 - of mine
48:57 - um but then i heard my wrists so now i'm
48:59 - like i don't really think that's a good
49:01 - idea uh for me to do but
49:04 - um
49:05 - anyway
49:06 - so i don't really go to the gym but i've
49:08 - been working out every morning for the
49:10 - last two weeks so today officially is um
49:14 - is two weeks
49:16 - so
49:17 - i'm really proud of that
49:19 - before that i hadn't worked out for a
49:21 - really long time it was just really
49:23 - sporadic like i work out maybe a few
49:25 - times a month here and there
49:28 - um
49:29 - but anyway
49:32 - let me go back
49:34 - to the code
49:36 - and
49:37 - all right so we've basically proven that
49:38 - the concept here works and it works with
49:41 - our new route
49:42 - let's make sure that we can also make it
49:45 - work with
49:47 - um
49:50 - have so like the old route will still
49:51 - work
49:53 - all right see and it says that that is
49:54 - nice keep training thanks i appreciate
49:57 - that i'm like i'm scared though that if
50:00 - i
50:01 - miss my workout once like it's just
50:03 - gonna throw me off so i'm really
50:06 - like
50:07 - i've been trying to go to bed super
50:08 - early so i know i can wake up and work
50:11 - out
50:12 - i mean i know it's going to happen
50:13 - eventually i i probably i can't keep
50:15 - this up forever but
50:18 - um
50:20 - for right now i at least want to build
50:21 - that habit i want to keep it up for like
50:23 - at least a month
50:25 - and
50:26 - then hopefully it's enough of a habit
50:28 - that i won't you know be easily
50:31 - um
50:34 - you know thrown off
50:36 - all right i'm gonna copy this route and
50:38 - paste it in just to test and make sure
50:40 - that this works and see film studies
50:44 - i have to double check to make sure that
50:46 - that's the right
50:48 - slug so if this doesn't work i'll check
50:50 - that
50:59 - all right yeah it's not the right slug
51:01 - let's
51:02 - let me go back here
51:04 - i have wordpress open on my other screen
51:06 - so i can check the routes
51:09 - film studies
51:10 - there's this slug
51:13 - film studies minor all right
51:16 - so this one is
51:18 - film studies minor
51:27 - and i'll
51:28 - probably need to restart this huh
51:45 - there we are
51:46 - okay yeah so that works so we can use
51:49 - com arts film studies and that should
51:52 - work for us and then we should also be
51:54 - able to do
51:57 - minor slash
52:06 - film studies minor
52:08 - all right great now what we can do
52:11 - [Music]
52:12 - at some point is clean up those slugs in
52:15 - wordpress so that it doesn't say minor
52:17 - on the end if we don't want it
52:19 - uh so we don't actually have to
52:22 - you know have minor here and then minor
52:24 - at the end because that's a little
52:25 - redundant i don't think we need that
52:27 - so that can that's something though that
52:29 - i could have someone else do even if
52:32 - they don't know about coding i could
52:34 - just you know give them some
52:35 - instructions and say go through all of
52:37 - them and do it like this
52:38 - so i'm not going to do it right now
52:43 - let's see
52:48 - all right so let's go into
52:55 - let's see
53:01 - let's check out a
53:03 - let's see
53:06 - another post type
53:10 - okay you know what i i do um i want to
53:12 - do this
53:15 - so let me
53:16 - see programs
53:33 - all right
53:37 - here's what i'm gonna do
53:45 - i'm going to grab this because this is
53:47 - going to be almost exactly what i want
53:49 - to do for
53:50 - these programs
54:07 - okay so whenever this associate degree
54:10 - programs
54:11 - and right now
54:15 - let's check this out and go to
54:22 - associate degree program so our url then
54:25 - is
54:28 - let's see what our url is going to be
54:31 - waiting just waiting okay
54:34 - oh goodness academics ug associate
54:44 - are there really no links for these
54:46 - programs
54:48 - oh they just have them within here but
54:50 - this is a okay
54:57 - all right so these links are also not
55:00 - standard
55:04 - all right and there's not a separate
55:05 - page for this associates degree it just
55:07 - links you to the
55:09 - main accounting
55:11 - page
55:12 - so there may not even be separate pages
55:14 - for
55:15 - associates programs
55:22 - yeah there's no separate pages
55:25 - okay
55:34 - there we are here's a separate page for
55:36 - an associate's program
55:42 - all right
55:45 - so we may
55:47 - we may only have one actual page for
55:50 - associates programs
55:53 - who
55:54 - okay
56:05 - so
56:25 - wow these um
56:28 - these routes are going to be the hardest
56:29 - part of this whole thing i think
56:51 - okay
56:52 - so we'll do
56:56 - for the associate degree programs for
56:59 - now
57:03 - i'm going to i'm just going to leave
57:05 - this as associate
57:10 - and we're gonna have this as associate
57:12 - but we may not even need this
57:16 - if there's really only one page
57:18 - uh i don't know if it's worth it
57:20 - although i may we may think about like
57:22 - okay well shouldn't we have a separate
57:24 - page for each associate program
57:27 - so i'll have to talk i don't handle
57:29 - content
57:30 - um and i don't really want to handle the
57:32 - content
57:34 - so i have to talk to my boss about that
57:36 - and see what he thinks for that that
57:37 - might be something that gets added in so
57:39 - i'm going to leave it in here for now
57:41 - and then up here
57:45 - let's say
57:49 - we're going to say associate here
57:52 - and then
57:54 - i want to take this to
57:57 - the associate page
58:00 - as well
58:02 - and then i want to give it the id of
58:06 - um let's say home remain
58:10 - let's give the idea of maine
58:12 - uh so i i was been thinking about how to
58:14 - do this and
58:17 - one way
58:18 - so we have a situation where
58:20 - we'll have
58:23 - let's say here like departments so
58:26 - the slash department i want to just have
58:28 - a list of all the different department
58:30 - pages so that when you go slash
58:32 - department slash id you can get to those
58:34 - pages so my original thought was okay
58:36 - i'll have it say when it slash
58:38 - department i'll send it to an entirely
58:40 - different component right meaning
58:42 - department list which will work
58:45 - but
58:46 - let's say the components are close
58:48 - enough that we don't really need two
58:49 - components
58:51 - so i thought why not try it like this
58:53 - and just manually pass in the id main
58:56 - and then make sure to say okay if the id
58:58 - is main
59:00 - then do this and then we'll make the
59:02 - slug
59:03 - in wordpress match so we'll make the
59:05 - slug say main being the main page
59:13 - so i'm going to try both different ways
59:16 - just to see maybe if there's some issue
59:18 - that i'm not seeing
59:20 - but
59:21 - this way we'll
59:23 - cut down on the number of components
59:25 - that we need to make
59:28 - and like as long as the components are
59:31 - are going to be very similar
59:33 - then this works if we need minor changes
59:36 - between you know how
59:38 - one of these pages display versus the
59:40 - main page
59:42 - we can work that out within a component
59:44 - if it's major changes then it might make
59:46 - more sense to have two different
59:47 - components
59:49 - but right now let's
59:50 - let's test this out
59:53 - so let's save that i'm going to go into
59:55 - wordpress here and
59:58 - i guess i can do this over here so
60:00 - everyone can see
60:02 - so i've just gone in this associate
60:03 - academic programs uh text which is right
60:07 - now the only piece of data that we have
60:09 - in here
60:10 - and
60:11 - i click so that to make the slug visible
60:14 - and i'm going to make the slug main
60:16 - which should be fine and won't mess up
60:17 - anything in wordpress because it's it's
60:20 - under the associate programs
60:22 - and then main so
60:24 - we don't have a program called main so
60:26 - this should work and not conflict
60:30 - so now that that's main
60:32 - we should be able to get this
60:35 - and we're going to need to make a new
60:39 - a new query
60:45 - i wonder
60:48 - there's probably a way that we can clean
60:50 - this up and not have so many
60:52 - different queries as well
60:55 - but i'm gonna wait
60:57 - and that can be uh some you know kind of
60:59 - an optimization that we do later on
61:01 - if we need to
61:06 - so for right now let's make a new query
61:08 - new file and let's call this
61:11 - associate
61:14 - dot js
61:17 - wonderful let's go to minor oops
61:20 - minor query
61:23 - and associate.js
61:26 - and now let's just change things to
61:28 - associate
61:43 - okay let's save that
61:45 - and let's also make a page
61:54 - so
61:55 - this is just the component
61:57 - and we'll take
61:59 - what we did here with minor
62:02 - and let's put it here so we need to
62:04 - change every instance of the word minor
62:08 - and make it associate
62:14 - and let's make sure we're getting our
62:16 - capitalization
62:18 - correct all right so
62:21 - what will happen is we go to the url the
62:23 - id part of the url will get passed into
62:25 - here
62:26 - and then that will be available to pass
62:30 - on to the query we'll get the data back
62:32 - the data will be stored in props and
62:35 - then the data will be used to render
62:39 - this component
62:42 - if you want a more thorough explanation
62:44 - of how that works you can ask me the
62:46 - live chat or you can go back and
62:48 - re-watch some of the streams that we did
62:50 - earlier on
62:52 - uh towards the beginning of project five
62:55 - and
62:56 - i i do go
62:57 - you know in a lot more depth into you
63:00 - know how this works
63:03 - alright so we need to restart our server
63:07 - because we change some routes in our
63:08 - server.js file
63:15 - and after that starts up we will be able
63:18 - to go to
63:21 - associate
63:26 - oops
63:28 - let's make sure i did that right all
63:30 - right so we do have associate we have
63:33 - this associate query
63:36 - and
63:38 - we have this
63:41 - let's see if i did this right on the
63:42 - server
63:43 - city
63:54 - you know let me see how what i i made
63:56 - this in wordpress so
64:00 - i think it was more than just associate
64:03 - so here's our custom post type in
64:05 - wordpress and i believe i made it
64:07 - associate program
64:09 - there we are associate program
64:15 - so in our query
64:17 - we need to look for
64:21 - associates
64:25 - program
64:29 - i think like this
64:31 - i think that's it
64:34 - i guess we can double check news
64:40 - all right well let's give it a shot
64:44 - no
64:46 - programs
64:51 - hmm
65:02 - all right let's check
65:10 - i don't think i can use a hyphen here
65:18 - no i can't
65:24 - all right let's see
65:34 - did i never restart my timer no i didn't
65:37 - i'm just gonna have to keep an eye on
65:38 - the clock uh so i'm gonna work on this
65:40 - for just another few minutes and then
65:42 - i'll go back to the live chat
65:44 - so it's saying cannot reproperty edges
65:46 - of undefined so if we see in our
65:49 - component here
65:51 - see edges here it's saying there is no
65:53 - data for associate
65:55 - maybe that's because it's supposed to be
65:57 - associates
66:01 - um
66:03 - associate program
66:16 - there we are all right that was the
66:19 - whole point so here's my problem so i
66:21 - had well two problems one i was trying
66:23 - to get data under the name associate and
66:26 - that's not the name that i had saved the
66:27 - data under
66:28 - uh and i was trying to do that in two
66:30 - different places so
66:32 - i just had to change it in both places
66:34 - and now i can get the data here's how
66:36 - it's coming in for us so
66:38 - um
66:40 - i'm not thrilled with how that looks
66:42 - especially like the main headline here
66:45 - is smaller than all the sub headlines
66:51 - but i mean it's in at least we're
66:53 - getting the data and it works
67:01 - and it has oh no
67:04 - it has weird stuff like this so the um
67:06 - this is taking us to maine.aspx
67:13 - admissions main.aspx so
67:17 - i was hoping that most of the links
67:18 - would work
67:20 - but links that have.aspx at the end are
67:23 - obviously not going to work
67:26 - i didn't realize that was a thing
67:28 - happening on this site
67:32 - so definitely have to address that
67:34 - that just might be that'll be a thing
67:36 - that either i can find like one thing to
67:38 - go through all the database and remove
67:40 - that or maybe i can write something
67:43 - that'll remove it as we import things
67:46 - or that'll just be something that
67:49 - as we're testing the site and as we go
67:51 - keep going through every time we find it
67:52 - i'll just have to change it
67:55 - or have someone else change it in
67:56 - wordpress
67:59 - okay
68:01 - so the idea though is that
68:04 - you have each of these and then a page
68:06 - for each of these and when you click the
68:08 - link it would take you to associate
68:09 - slash and then let's say theology and
68:13 - then that would show you the associates
68:14 - in theology page
68:16 - but you're just a slash associate page
68:19 - would have your list of everything and
68:20 - we're gonna do a similar thing for the
68:22 - majors for the miners for departments
68:26 - you know anything that would make sense
68:28 - to have a list of everything first which
68:30 - is gonna be most of the sections we're
68:32 - gonna do it like that
68:38 - looks good i'm going to go back to the
68:39 - live chat now
68:42 - and even though i forgot the timer i
68:44 - think we're basically staying on about
68:45 - the same time frame that we normally do
68:48 - so i'm going back to the live chat right
68:50 - now i'm going to try to answer all the
68:52 - questions that are in there so if you
68:53 - have a question please put it in there
68:55 - now
68:56 - and
68:57 - if you don't want to stick around for
68:58 - the question and answer that's totally
69:00 - fine i'll see you tomorrow
69:02 - if you can stick around though i would
69:04 - appreciate your help in answering the
69:06 - questions
69:08 - uh most of the time you all have great
69:10 - answers uh much better than than what i
69:13 - can come up with
69:17 - okay
69:39 - michael
69:41 - asks can you set up a database with
69:43 - department program degree type
69:49 - um were we at that point were we still
69:51 - talking about routing
69:54 - just to be able to
69:55 - i guess grab those or
69:59 - i mean i guess it's possible
70:10 - michael says you or one of the students
70:12 - is going to have to hard code some stuff
70:14 - you're gonna have to deal with it yeah i
70:15 - mean uh
70:17 - yeah that's just the way it's gonna be
70:19 - i mean eventually who knows maybe after
70:22 - a couple of years all the links will be
70:25 - or at least most of the links will be
70:26 - switched over to a more sane system
70:31 - but
70:33 - i i don't know for right now we just got
70:35 - to cover it and try to
70:37 - get as many links as possible
70:39 - to work
70:53 - michael says you really should only need
70:55 - three queries department program degree
70:58 - type
71:04 - uh then branch out from there
71:07 - hmm
71:09 - yeah i'm wondering
71:18 - i'm thinking about that there there's
71:21 - there may def be a much better way to
71:24 - handle this data
71:29 - it's not going to be ideal i mean
71:31 - unfortunately i
71:33 - in migrating the data
71:38 - it right now the data is not organized
71:43 - in in a way that makes it easy to find
71:46 - stuff
71:47 - um
71:48 - so that makes it kind of difficult when
71:50 - i'm trying to bring it over
71:54 - but then also
71:56 - i'm bringing it over into wordpress i
71:58 - want it to be set up in a way that
72:01 - it's like
72:03 - makes some sense
72:04 - so i'm making everything as custom post
72:06 - types so that whoever's editing it can
72:08 - quickly see like oh okay it's the major
72:11 - custom post type that's where i put
72:12 - stuff for majors
72:14 - so i'm not sure how i could set it up
72:16 - differently to follow that hierarchy
72:20 - the other way potentially could be set
72:22 - up a different
72:24 - server a graphql server that
72:29 - i don't know organize things differently
72:33 - i have to think about that
72:36 - i mean right now i do have
72:38 - a category
72:43 - i say the problem with the way that
72:45 - things work with wordpress is like i
72:47 - can't grab
72:51 - i don't think i can grab multiple custom
72:53 - post types like with one query
73:02 - i'm gonna have to look into that
73:05 - i was reading some issues on it on um
73:09 - on github
73:12 - anyway
73:14 - i agree that this is not ideal this is
73:16 - just kind of
73:18 - we're making it better than it is now
73:21 - but it's not probably like the most
73:23 - ideal way to organize everything
73:45 - uh michael says i might not know much
73:47 - about react wordpress or bjs ninja but i
73:50 - do know about databases i just think
73:51 - that way all right that's cool i don't
73:53 - know a lot about databases so any advice
73:55 - you have for me in that area is is
73:57 - definitely welcome
73:59 - michael says not sure why you are so
74:01 - worried about major slash minor
74:04 - um
74:06 - i mean i'm not
74:08 - it's not major minor in particular it's
74:10 - just kind of in general like
74:13 - the way things are happening with the
74:15 - urls on major and minor are also
74:18 - happening
74:18 - i mean that's just kind of the way
74:20 - things are across the the site so
74:23 - it's not that major minor is so
74:25 - important it's just that the way we're
74:27 - going to have to deal with this
74:28 - everywhere is definitely important and i
74:31 - want to be consistent so that's kind of
74:32 - why i try i'm putting so much thought
74:34 - into it now
74:36 - because whatever i decide we need to use
74:38 - that going forward if i change my mind
74:40 - later then i'll have to go back and redo
74:43 - it
74:46 - which isn't a big deal except that you
74:47 - know we need to get this launched in
74:51 - like a month
74:56 - and february is a short month so
74:59 - we're missing out on a few days
75:02 - okay
75:04 - uh i've gotten to the bottom of the live
75:07 - chat
75:08 - so i think
75:12 - i think underwraps
75:14 - savage banana says you cutie jesse thank
75:17 - you
75:19 - i try i've been uh combing my beard
75:21 - lately so i'm glad you noticed my beauty
75:24 - so
75:29 - um
75:30 - all right so i'm going to get back to
75:35 - bringing more data over
75:38 - and
75:39 - the more data i bring over the better
75:41 - picture i have of what we're dealing
75:42 - with so questions like how we're going
75:44 - to deal with um
75:48 - like moving you know how to deal with
75:50 - urls and organize things so
75:52 - i'll have a better idea of what what
75:54 - we're dealing with
75:57 - um savagement says it's laughing say
75:59 - yeah the death the death side of the
76:01 - beard
76:04 - uh
76:06 - all right i i really enjoy doing these
76:08 - live streams with you all
76:10 - um
76:12 - yeah so i should be back tomorrow
76:15 - probably around the same time i don't
76:17 - think i have anything conflicting on the
76:18 - schedule and
76:22 - we'll be doing some of the same work uh
76:24 - same work tomorrow so it's gonna be a
76:25 - lot of the same for a little while
76:28 - and then depending on how much data we
76:30 - get moved over how much we get done then
76:31 - maybe we can move on making it
76:34 - look nice optimizing things refactoring
76:38 - and
76:39 - testing
76:41 - lots of testing as much as we can
76:45 - all right well
76:46 - i'll be back tomorrow until then have a
76:49 - great day
