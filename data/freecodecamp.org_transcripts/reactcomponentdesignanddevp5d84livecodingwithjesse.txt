00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and I'm motivated
00:10 - today we're gonna get some stuff done so
00:15 - not sure why I'm so motivated because
00:19 - it's Monday but we got a good workout in
00:23 - this morning so maybe that's why I don't
00:24 - know but we're gonna go back to react
00:28 - land today we spent some time with PHP
00:31 - the last few streams and I'm just a
00:34 - little frustrated with it so I want to
00:35 - take a break from that and build a react
00:39 - component doesn't sneeze done so may as
00:43 - well do it give my mind a little break
00:45 - from the PHP maybe I come back to it
00:47 - with a fresh point of view and hopefully
00:50 - figure it out before we get started I
00:53 - just want to let you know about a few
00:56 - other things first I I want to show you
01:02 - all this GoFundMe campaign that I am I
01:10 - started and so Charles is a free code
01:17 - camp editor for a medium publication and
01:21 - he's trying he was named one of the top
01:24 - contributors so he's trying to get to
01:27 - one of these ceremonies slash parties
01:29 - but he needs some help financially so
01:34 - I'm gonna put a link to this in the chat
01:39 - if anybody's interested you know any any
01:42 - amount of money would help but I think
01:45 - it'd be awesome if we could help out
01:47 - Charles in getting there so you know he
01:51 - needs money for the plane tickets for
01:54 - you know getting a hotel for food you
01:57 - know for all that so he'll be coming
02:00 - from Nigeria so anyway check it out if
02:04 - you get a chance you can read more about
02:06 - his story and you know maybe you'll give
02:10 - a donation or at least
02:12 - if you're not really in a good place
02:14 - financially so that's number one number
02:19 - two I just wanted to give a shout out to
02:22 - my patrons I haven't talked about it for
02:24 - a long time but just wanted to remind
02:27 - everybody that I have this I will link
02:29 - to it and I'm not gonna talk about this
02:33 - every stream as I promised before so
02:36 - maybe once a month or something I'll
02:37 - mention it but I did want to give a
02:39 - shout out so thank you so much to Dondre
02:44 - Oliver dawn and Audrey for for being
02:49 - patrons so right now the for patrons and
02:53 - I'm super appreciative of that so thank
02:55 - you so much and yeah so let's get
03:02 - started now and enough enough about this
03:05 - other stuff also if you'll follow me on
03:16 - some social media you might have seen
03:18 - I've been working on a react native
03:19 - project on the side for for balance IO
03:22 - if anybody be interested in seeing
03:24 - anything about that the project's open
03:26 - source so there shouldn't really be a
03:27 - problem with me live-streaming that on
03:30 - my I probably do it on my own channel
03:31 - maybe like on the weekends or at night
03:33 - or something so let me know if you'd be
03:35 - interested in seeing that I really like
03:37 - the project I have a having a lot of fun
03:40 - working with react native it's mostly
03:42 - just UI stuff so somebody else was
03:46 - working back in and somebody else was
03:47 - doing the design so I'm taking sketch
03:49 - files and turning them from just the
03:53 - design files and turning them into
03:55 - actual react native components so just
04:00 - thought I'd throw that out there see if
04:02 - there's any interest and then maybe I'll
04:04 - do some live streams for that as well so
04:08 - let me know in the chat or in the
04:10 - comments below or however else you feel
04:12 - like getting a hold of me okay let me
04:17 - get my screens situated cool I spent
04:21 - less than three minutes on all the other
04:22 - business now we can get to where
04:24 - coding let me say what's up to everybody
04:26 - in the chat oh great we have a almost 60
04:31 - viewers so welcome everyone especially
04:33 - if you're new let me give you a little
04:35 - breakdown we're gonna do 25 minutes of
04:38 - code and then we'll take a little break
04:39 - about five minutes and I'll go back to
04:41 - the live chat answer questions and we'll
04:43 - go back and forth like that and probably
04:48 - at least twice we'll go back and forth
04:49 - like that and then at the end whatever
04:50 - questions are left over I'll go through
04:52 - the chat Oh answer all your questions
04:54 - feel free to add questions at any time
04:56 - or let me know if I'm doing something
04:59 - wrong
04:59 - you know that's don't be shy about that
05:02 - and oh Shubham says hi Jesse today I
05:11 - started my career as a web developer
05:13 - really happy congratulations
05:16 - congratulations I hope you start your
05:20 - career off you know really well and you
05:23 - enjoy it I certainly enjoy what I'm
05:25 - doing okay so let's get to this code I
05:32 - guess first thing we should start with
05:35 - is let me show you the old way we're
05:41 - displaying this data on the old site and
05:43 - then we can come up with design ideas
05:46 - for how we want to display it once we
05:48 - have the idea in our head about a design
05:50 - then we'll start doing the coding so let
05:53 - me start my timer so I can find it
05:56 - yep there we go
06:03 - this Poulos Pomodoro timer over here
06:06 - start it up okay let's see this one
06:13 - might have it there we go all right so
06:16 - this is the data that I want to display
06:20 - with this component that we're building
06:22 - so we'll have a title for the the
06:26 - program in general this is for
06:28 - University and we'll have basically four
06:34 - four tabs I'll probably keep the tab
06:37 - idea because I think that that works for
06:43 - each year right now it's not always like
06:47 - this so there's going to be some
06:48 - variations so for here it's freshman
06:51 - sophomore junior and then they go to a
06:52 - different school to finish out but
06:54 - sometimes this this won't be based on on
06:57 - year so these are going to be variable
07:00 - and I'd love to figure out how we deal
07:07 - with this because right now I don't have
07:09 - an input to make these variables so I'll
07:13 - deal with that on the con on the backend
07:15 - side of things but in terms of the UI it
07:19 - won't really matter for today and then
07:23 - within each tab will have two columns
07:25 - there are two sections and then we'll
07:29 - have courses beneath them now these look
07:31 - like their links but they're actually
07:33 - not I'm not sure why they show up as
07:35 - links here they just link back to the
07:38 - same page so it's a bit misleading on
07:41 - the current site don't I don't really
07:44 - know why they it was built like this so
07:48 - that's what we want now we do have this
07:51 - link to view all course descriptions and
07:54 - this link actually doesn't take you to
07:57 - course descriptions either so it on
08:00 - sometimes it does and sometimes it takes
08:03 - you the current page so currently it's
08:05 - not really the best user experience so
08:08 - that's all the data that we'll have now
08:12 - I'd like to figure out what's a better
08:14 - way that matches our design
08:17 - that that would work Oh Michael asked if
08:20 - we're gonna do an grow up today yeah we
08:23 - could do then go out let me let me grab
08:27 - my terminal and start that up
08:43 - it's been a while since I've done in
08:45 - grok I remember how I did that all right
08:52 - sweet I think I remember it reporter
08:57 - beyond 3000 well we will be on 3,000
09:02 - once I started so let's start this up
09:10 - young starts is that it
09:16 - nope Johann dev I'm working on different
09:22 - projects and sometimes it's yarn dev and
09:25 - sometimes it's yarn start so I I'm
09:29 - getting them confused now okay so if
09:32 - you're not familiar with n drop this is
09:33 - gonna let you all view what's locally
09:37 - running on my machine and you'll be able
09:39 - to see the the changes and the updates
09:41 - as they happen so I just need to get
09:46 - this started here I'll pull this over so
09:48 - y'all can see what I'm doing so here's n
09:55 - grog and there's a free version of this
10:00 - so if you're interested in using this
10:02 - you know check it out just google and
10:05 - rock and gr okay and you should come up
10:08 - so oops and rock a CTEP should be 8080
10:21 - or 3000 I mean 3000 there we go
10:28 - all right so let me give you I can't
10:33 - remember which one's it if both of these
10:36 - worked or not so I'll just paste both
10:39 - links in here the HTTP and the HTTP link
10:46 - so area I see some of you are connecting
10:50 - cool
10:57 - Wow
10:58 - Elon Musk is here in the chat so welcome
11:02 - big fan of your work
11:07 - just joking I'm sure it's not really a
11:09 - lie musk okay let's let's get rid of
11:17 - some of these tabs I don't need and I
11:27 - will yet here all right this is what we
11:32 - want to look at so let me go to I think
11:46 - we have the pharmacy page working so we
11:48 - can see both pages side by side oh wow
11:53 - right now I have nothing so this is the
11:57 - page that that program would go on and I
12:00 - have no information right now so let's
12:03 - try to find a page that actually has
12:05 - information maybe maybe the English page
12:13 - No
12:20 - education well that image is huge may
12:29 - need to do something about that because
12:30 - that's really big right now okay so
12:37 - here's the data that we're getting in
12:39 - now and we just having a big list let's
12:50 - go back here and see alright so we are
12:53 - going with the material design kind of
12:56 - look for everything so usually when you
13:01 - see material design stuff the tabs
13:03 - aren't down the side the tabs are on the
13:05 - top so we may end up one with something
13:09 - on the top and we are using material UI
13:12 - so let's check out material you I and
13:15 - I'm gonna so let's check out the tabs
13:21 - because we may be able to use some of
13:25 - the stuff from the tabs and I'll paste
13:29 - that in the chat as well so y'all can
13:32 - check it out if you want so we may be
13:33 - able to use some of this as kind of the
13:35 - basis for our component and that'll take
13:37 - care of a lot of the you just switching
13:40 - back and forth so we don't really have
13:42 - to think through all that which is cool
13:46 - the one thing I'm concerned about is
13:50 - with all these tabs we're gonna have
13:52 - four tabs if we put four tabs across the
13:57 - top depending on what these labels are
14:04 - that might be too much I mean we could
14:09 - try to cut it down so I mean we don't
14:11 - really need to use a year here we could
14:13 - say freshman sophomore junior we could
14:19 - even switch it up and say year one year
14:21 - two year three year four I mean that's
14:25 - possible so I mean yeah I guess let's
14:28 - just assume that we can cut this down to
14:31 - be maybe like six
14:33 - characters I think that might be doable
14:38 - to do for across let's see how this
14:43 - looks when we shrink the screen all
14:46 - right at some point you just scroll okay
14:49 - I'm alright with that
14:51 - normally I don't like horizontal
14:52 - scrolling but in this case it it would
14:59 - actually fit with what's done with
15:04 - material material design okay so
15:08 - hopefully we can avoid that
15:11 - maybe with adjusting padding and things
15:14 - like that alright but that looks good
15:17 - I'd say that's a good start alright so
15:22 - let's assume for now and we'll build
15:24 - this out and see how it looks and then
15:26 - we may change it but let's assume for
15:27 - now that we're going to use these tabs
15:31 - up top to represent you know these then
15:37 - really this this layout here where we
15:40 - have first semester second semester I I
15:46 - don't think that's that's bad I think
15:48 - that's an okay layout the thing that I
15:52 - worry about is on a mobile mobile screen
15:55 - what's gonna happen so like this is what
15:57 - happens right now right it well two
16:02 - things happen right so actually that's
16:05 - better than I thought I assumed it was
16:08 - going to break the layout and we'd have
16:10 - a horizontal scroll okay I actually I
16:14 - really like how that stacks I really do
16:18 - like how that stacks and I'm not sure if
16:25 - we want to do an accordion here
16:26 - accordion style menu
16:32 - we'll see how it looks so here's the
16:37 - plan and then after I tell you what the
16:40 - plan is here I'll check the chat to see
16:42 - if anybody has any objections or other
16:44 - ideas
16:44 - so we'll do we'll start with the tabs up
16:48 - top for each of the years and then we'll
16:52 - do this look where it's side-by-side on
16:54 - large screens on smaller screens it
16:56 - stacks in here and then depending on how
17:01 - these tabs look on mobile we may switch
17:06 - up to an accordion style on mobile just
17:09 - on mobile only
17:10 - I think the accordion style would not
17:15 - look as good on a desktop so I'd like to
17:22 - stick with with the tabs if we can but
17:25 - we'll see how it looks and to start out
17:30 - with I'm not gonna worry about pulling
17:32 - data from anywhere we're just gonna hard
17:34 - code some of this data probably what
17:36 - I'll do is I'll just make an object an
17:40 - array of objects for all this stuff and
17:43 - we'll pull it in just within our
17:47 - component like I'm not gonna I think
17:50 - that'll be faster than trying to mess
17:51 - with getting this data which right now
17:53 - we actually we can't get this data right
17:56 - now because I don't have I don't have it
17:58 - set up to be able to get repeater fields
18:00 - from WordPress through graph QL so
18:03 - that's that's what we're working on the
18:05 - last couple streams and it's not
18:07 - finished yet we could potentially if if
18:10 - we can't figure out how to do it through
18:11 - a prio we could end up getting that just
18:13 - through the REST API but I'd rather not
18:17 - make to API calls on the page if I don't
18:19 - have to but that's that's kind of a
18:22 - back-up plan that could buy us some time
18:24 - we can still launch the site and it
18:25 - would work and then we could figure it
18:27 - out later
18:28 - all right so let me check the chat
18:33 - before we start definitely want to see
18:36 - what input you all have see so I'm
18:40 - skimming through I'm gonna skip over any
18:42 - questions for now I'm just gonna see if
18:44 - there's anything
18:45 - any advice for what we're doing right
18:48 - now
19:10 - our heart should say why is there 17
19:13 - pixel padding on the body it looks weird
19:15 - see on the homepage we got weird stuff
19:19 - going on on the homepage
19:39 - I'm not sure what I should I'm not sure
19:44 - what you're saying with the homepage
19:49 - John says you can maybe change the prop
19:53 - value of the tab title values based on
19:56 - media queries like oh okay okay yeah so
20:05 - John's saying that if we need to we may
20:07 - be able to change what the titles are
20:09 - for the tabs depending on the screen
20:11 - size so on larger screens we would have
20:13 - longer more descriptive titles on a
20:15 - smaller screen suite or shorter titles
20:16 - all right I'm gonna think about that
20:19 - I'll probably I'm gonna try to get away
20:22 - with just really short titles and then
20:24 - if my boss or someone really insists
20:29 - that we have more descriptive titles
20:30 - then I think that's a good plan William
20:34 - says so this is an ongoing project you
20:36 - have been working on yeah we've been
20:38 - working on it for since like December
20:41 - January something like that so yeah this
20:45 - this is a real project I'm doing for my
20:49 - full-time job here at a university so
20:54 - yes so this is not exactly a tutorial
20:57 - this is what my work is so you're gonna
21:00 - see me make mistakes and we're gonna
21:02 - make decisions here for this project
21:05 - during the stream and and this is a real
21:08 - project all right well let's get to it
21:14 - let's get to the code so first things
21:17 - first let's make this component so we'll
21:20 - go to let's go to this faculty let's go
21:30 - to this faculty j/s page first if you
21:33 - want to see this code you can go to the
21:36 - github repo that's linked in the
21:38 - description of this video and check out
21:40 - the code it's all up to date
21:42 - everything's open source so you can do
21:45 - what you want with it but what I like to
21:48 - do when I design a new component is
21:50 - first I'm just going to build it out
21:52 - within
21:52 - Paige that's going to be in and then
21:56 - once we get it to a point we're happy
21:59 - with it then I can I'll pull it out put
22:01 - it in a different a whole different file
22:05 - it's just kind of nicer to work with in
22:08 - one file at first okay
22:13 - so all right so here's where we have the
22:16 - the content is coming in and we have all
22:20 - the content being pulled in as a big
22:25 - chunk of HTML that's gonna change so
22:29 - we're already starting to break chunks
22:31 - out of here
22:31 - so this chunk now we're breaking out as
22:34 - that section that's that we saw that's
22:37 - that list of of courses so we'll be
22:46 - putting this section below so let's
22:49 - check out what code we need automatics
22:53 - for left and right buttons will
22:56 - automatically be presented on desktop
22:57 - and hit it on mobile
23:15 - I think we can go with these views for
23:23 - larger views we definitely want to use
23:26 - the scrollable tabs so let's grab these
23:32 - we want to get tab and tabs and it looks
23:40 - like they're getting app bar as well but
23:46 - I wonder if we can do this without that
23:50 - let's see if we can do without it and
23:54 - let's see what else we need that should
23:58 - be it and that's all we need right now
24:01 - so we'll grab these and we'll import
24:03 - them so if you're not familiar with
24:06 - react there might be a lot of stuff
24:10 - that's new here feel free to ask
24:12 - questions I'll do my best to explain so
24:18 - what we're doing now is we're importing
24:19 - this these components so they're just
24:23 - JavaScript files we're importing those
24:25 - JavaScript files into this file so that
24:28 - we can use them there so we say what
24:31 - we're going to name it and then we say
24:33 - how to get it right this is the file
24:35 - path so we're from now we're going to
24:37 - refer to all the code in this file as
24:39 - tabs and all the code in this file is
24:42 - tab ok and these are reacted components
24:46 - so we can go down here and we may as
24:50 - well just copy and paste the code that
24:51 - they have save us some time we're going
24:57 - to copy and paste this into here
25:06 - and we're gonna wrap this in a div I
25:11 - know now there is I believe a way to do
25:18 - this without having to wrap things in
25:19 - divs but I can't remember the syntax for
25:21 - it so we're gonna wrap things and divs
25:22 - and while I'm again okay
25:39 - I think it's just indentation stuff yeah
25:43 - here's what we need let's go back here
25:47 - and grab our state where's the state
26:00 - there it is
26:05 - okay so it's gonna use state in react to
26:17 - so we're gonna use state to determine
26:20 - which tab we're on and we may as well
26:25 - copy this as well so this is
26:30 - destructuring and i see how it lets us
26:34 - know i have to type in this state all
26:37 - the time when we want to call something
26:40 - that's in state so right here under
26:49 - render we're gonna put that in and now
26:52 - we shouldn't have this line let me save
26:56 - and see if I still have that line
27:05 - that's we constant state
27:17 - that's weird alright well this should
27:20 - work now so I'm just gonna go with it
27:34 - okay Nikki saying I think this version
27:37 - of neck supports the empty tags as
27:40 - fragments camp posts here YouTube blocks
27:44 - it's just an empty tag just removed if
27:46 - okay
27:48 - the Michael Patterson said it's it's
27:51 - react dot fragment tag I believe okay
27:56 - cool let's try it so down here actually
28:04 - let me see
28:15 - and he got put this in the wrong spot
28:24 - yeah let me pull this out cuz I don't
28:30 - think I think I can just put this here
28:36 - for now anyway
29:00 - yeah we're not actually getting any data
29:06 - yet so I'm not gonna mess with that
29:08 - right now I'll just put it here and then
29:13 - we don't have to worry about it at all
29:23 - okay
29:27 - oh we need the this dot handle change
29:31 - that's important so we're gonna grab
29:36 - this so we need a function to change the
29:40 - state whenever we click on a new tab
29:43 - right so now whenever a tab is clicked
29:46 - on is we're gonna call this set state
29:50 - value right so we're gonna change value
29:55 - to a different number right each of the
29:58 - tabs now are numbered so that's how
30:03 - we're gonna know which content to
30:05 - display okay so we have our tabs and
30:12 - labels and then where's our content here
30:17 - we go oh I see how they did it so they
30:23 - have this tab container up here in a
30:29 - function interesting
30:43 - alright that'll go be what we get into
30:47 - next for now the timer is almost up so
30:51 - let me go back to the chat answer
30:53 - questions for about five minutes and
30:55 - then then we'll come back
30:58 - add in some content and then see what it
31:02 - looks like a short break
31:07 - alright I'm gonna scroll up to the top
31:09 - of the chat now and scroll down through
31:12 - get to as many questions as I can
31:35 - it's
31:46 - okay Michael had had said definitely put
31:49 - year one so we're talking about what's
31:51 - what labels to use our tabs so it says
31:55 - because of people changing majors
31:56 - mid-career okay that that makes sense so
32:00 - to say software you know freshman
32:03 - sophomore junior senior year it might
32:06 - not work for everybody right it
32:07 - technically you could be a sophomore and
32:10 - then change to a different program and
32:12 - you're really going to be your one in
32:14 - that program so I do like that idea
32:26 - Benny says how do the accordions play
32:28 - with mobile devices I would think if
32:30 - there's a lot of info on the tab but we
32:31 - have pain to scroll on a mobile device
32:34 - yeah so there are a couple issues I've
32:38 - noticed with using accordions on mobile
32:40 - devices so that well sometimes it can be
32:45 - a little like janky when you try to open
32:48 - and shut the accordion
32:49 - depending on how you how you do it so
32:52 - the accordion that I've used before with
32:57 - materialised CSS which is not react
33:01 - based it is a little bit janky I don't
33:07 - know that's that's been probably a year
33:11 - or two ago that I've used that so it may
33:13 - be fixed now but it wasn't the animation
33:18 - just was not smooth so I've done
33:21 - accordions and react just really basic
33:26 - accordions with no no real animation and
33:29 - they're fine on mobile but you're right
33:34 - about the scrolling so you open it up
33:37 - have a lot of content you got to keep
33:39 - scrolling scrolling scrolling you do
33:41 - have the option to then you know close
33:43 - that you know but potentially if you
33:45 - open it read the way all the way through
33:47 - then you come into the next one you
33:50 - don't want have to scroll a back up I
33:52 - mean it's possible you could make it so
33:55 - that once you click on that next section
33:57 - of the accordion menu the first one
33:59 - closes so you'd never have more than one
34:00 - open at once so that can help keep the
34:04 - page a little bit shorter
34:06 - yeah but I definitely you know I
34:08 - understand you know the the accordion is
34:12 - not it's not always the best choice for
34:15 - for mobile if you're not sure what we're
34:20 - talking about with the accordion menu
34:23 - this is
34:27 - so when you have these little kind of
34:31 - drop-down things here that's sometimes
34:34 - called an accordion
34:52 - M Verma MV mo coding not sure how that
34:59 - you want that pronounced says please
35:01 - create apps with react native all right
35:03 - cool yeah I'd I mean I don't know if you
35:04 - were here earlier but I mentioned I'm
35:06 - doing a side project with react native
35:08 - and if anyone's interested I may do some
35:11 - streams on my channel for that so the
35:15 - link to my channel is in the description
35:16 - so if anybody wants you go to my channel
35:19 - if you subscribe and turn on
35:21 - notifications you should get notified
35:23 - anytime I I live stream so maybe I'll
35:26 - start streaming that that project that
35:30 - react native project okay Michael says I
35:39 - can't remember the link to get to the
35:40 - department you're working on and rock
35:43 - slash education goes to the old page
35:49 - that's weird do you mean like if you're
35:53 - on end rock and then you type slash
35:55 - education it goes to this page like the
35:58 - the main website did we have to do it a
36:07 - different way I can't remember
36:14 - okay
36:20 - alright it looks like there's discussion
36:22 - about f1 also Formula One racing is that
36:28 - it alright so I'm gonna skip over that
36:30 - you're welcome to discuss that in the
36:32 - chat but I'm not gonna read it up
36:35 - alright cool so I got actually got
36:38 - through everything if I miss your
36:39 - question just put it in there again and
36:41 - I'll see it the next time around let's
36:44 - start up our next 25 minutes timer and
36:47 - now we're gonna get this component
36:50 - working so it should show up below here
36:58 - is where we'll see it I don't think I've
37:00 - saved it yet so we're not seeing it yet
37:04 - [Music]
37:08 - good night son I'd say yeah let's save
37:11 - it and see what we get nothing yeah that
37:19 - is it
37:26 - Oh No I know why I'm looking in the
37:30 - wrong component we're not in faculty
37:33 - we're on we're in major okay let me get
37:42 - the right page up here let's close out
37:46 - some stuff because I have too many
37:49 - things open
38:00 - okay
38:04 - major all right so let's just get rid of
38:11 - this stuff I add it over there and I
38:18 - can't put it pull these out put them
38:25 - here and the query actually not I think
38:29 - about it we do we should put this inside
38:32 - the query component because at some
38:35 - point we hopefully will be getting the
38:37 - data from graph QL
38:38 - if not we can move this but for now
38:41 - let's put it in here and let's try What
38:44 - did he say I could do an empty is this
38:51 - what you are talking about with the
38:52 - shorthand for the react fragments let me
38:59 - know if that's the way to do it or not I
39:02 - guess I can just look it up it's not let
39:05 - me get this copied over and then I'll
39:06 - just look up the syntax because I don't
39:12 - think we've done anything with fragments
39:16 - weight is the global X still in there oh
39:19 - no I can't believe it's still in there I
39:23 - every time I've seen it I tried to take
39:26 - it out but that was just something hard
39:29 - should put in there for testing so keep
39:33 - forgetting to take it out all right so
39:36 - let's grab these two things and then
39:39 - that one and we'll be finished getting
39:43 - everything out of here there we go
39:50 - oh yeah and now I'm just gonna back out
39:56 - all this stuff there we go okay
40:11 - alright let's just check this fragment
40:17 - syntax
40:25 - okay fragments fragments
40:34 - fragment component there we go tackle
40:40 - cool
40:46 - all right so that should work
41:09 - all right let's check Oh property value
41:14 - of null for what 30
41:37 - where I miss
42:21 - it's
42:33 - all right anybody see what the issue is
42:39 - I probably should double-check this to
42:42 - make sure we got everything that we
42:44 - needed
42:53 - all right so pulling these that's good
43:00 - we didn't use this yet we're not using
43:05 - prop types we don't need this root style
43:10 - right yeah we're not using that here
43:22 - let's a button we have the state we have
43:28 - the handle change are we even bringing
43:34 - any props no
43:43 - all right we have everything maybe maybe
43:47 - I don't have the latest version of next
43:50 - so maybe it doesn't support this so
43:53 - let's just throw in a div here just to
43:58 - see if that makes a difference
44:05 - mm obscurities
44:22 - okay so it wasn't that so I guess I'll
44:29 - go back to what we had before
45:11 - oh okay it says John says is it not
45:16 - necessary to import a fragment from
45:18 - reactant using the empty tags I don't
45:21 - know
46:22 - okay
46:54 - all right so we don't need to
46:56 - specifically import fragment as harsh
47:01 - it's pointing out in the chat because it
47:04 - it comes in with react when we a just
47:06 - import reacts up here or we bring it
47:14 - really brought it yeah up here there
47:18 - yeah
47:49 - all right let me paste in the rest of of
47:57 - what we're supposed to have
48:06 - because Siri will just paste in a couple
48:16 - of these
48:17 - maybe it's looking for these I don't
48:20 - know that doesn't really make any sense
48:32 - she Michael says roll back and had one
48:37 - thing at a time yeah actually that's a
48:40 - good idea instead of adding things let's
48:43 - take away things
48:57 - let's get rid of a little bit just so
49:00 - that we have less to deal with let's
49:05 - take the tabs out
49:14 - can I be property value of no is this
49:20 - this state
49:33 - alright let's just take this out
49:57 - all right what am i doing do I have the
50:02 - style in the wrong plate or the state in
50:04 - the wrong place maybe that's it no I
50:12 - don't
50:19 - why isn't it recognizing this state
50:27 - Michael said I may comment them out yeah
50:31 - I guess that would have been easier
50:44 - what the heck
51:01 - so it's just not it's not recognizing
51:07 - that there's a value can't read property
51:11 - value of you know so when I try to go
51:15 - get this state it's saying that state is
51:23 - null
51:43 - all right so the error message
51:49 - there's more close up of the air message
51:53 - so so can tree property value of null so
51:57 - I'm trying to look at the property value
52:00 - of state of this state so for some
52:06 - reason it's saying state is null
52:20 - and I'm wondering why why does it say
52:26 - state is no I may not maybe a copy and
52:33 - paste thing all right Hudson
52:47 - try console logging this state which I'm
52:58 - assuming it's not going to be able to
52:59 - find stable let's see
53:31 - yeah
53:43 - I don't know what happened we just
53:46 - decided to work all right but we've got
53:49 - all kind of weirdness going on here too
53:52 - okay so we now have stayed
54:03 - why do we have this get rid of that and
54:13 - whoa all right so I'm gonna just go with
54:19 - a div here because when I don't do the
54:24 - div and I try to do the fragment it
54:26 - keeps inserting all this stuff so maybe
54:31 - that's just I don't know maybe that's
54:33 - just my editor and the way I have it set
54:35 - up but I'm okay with just using div it
54:41 - shouldn't mess up anything all right so
54:47 - now yeah all right so now we don't have
54:51 - that weirdness going on but here we have
54:53 - our our tabs great we have our tabs took
55:00 - way longer than I thought to just get
55:01 - these tabs working but sometimes that's
55:04 - how it is okay now that we have our tabs
55:08 - we can put some content here that
55:11 - correspond to those tabs so let's just
55:16 - grab a few of these
55:25 - we will paste them down here below the
55:34 - tabs and let's add another tag and this
55:46 - change item to year your for I may
56:02 - change these two numerals we'll just see
56:04 - on the space they take up and I guess I
56:10 - can try to put yeah let's some D
56:17 - structure that value again others copy
56:21 - it
56:29 - okay
56:43 - for now let's just change this see what
56:50 - we have already up here we pulling in
56:53 - anything no all right for now I'm just
56:57 - going to change this to the div and
57:10 - it'll just display this okay
57:27 - there we go so now you see we click on
57:32 - these tabs and we get the data changing
57:38 - here so awesome so that works just like
57:43 - we wanted to actually doesn't take up
57:47 - that much space let's shrink it up a bit
57:54 - Gobbo zoomed in here area yeah so if we
57:58 - get it kind of smaller we will have this
58:02 - scroll here okay I can handle that for
58:12 - now all right so now we need a little
58:17 - bit of structure for this part of it and
58:21 - then we'll also work on we will work on
58:30 - this right we we don't really want it
58:32 - looks like this is getting centered or
58:35 - something we don't really want that so
58:38 - we need to fix that too but first things
58:41 - first let's get the data in there and
58:42 - see how it looks and then we can work on
58:44 - styling it a bit more all right and
58:50 - about three minutes we'll go back to the
58:51 - chat and check out what's going on there
58:55 - so I think we'll go with
59:06 - let's see what we have here in material
59:09 - UI in terms of less to be needless see
59:19 - what the list look like yeah I don't
59:24 - think we really need to go with a list
59:27 - like this
59:37 - so we can probably just go with basic
59:40 - like you oli
59:52 - all right so for now
60:06 - and so I'll just build this out right
60:08 - here so we'll need to
60:35 - this will be nice one
60:50 - we'll just do it like this five classes
60:54 - [Music]
61:00 - what's the is there something for an
61:04 - unordered list that's like a list header
61:06 - I can't remember if there is a tag like
61:13 - that let me know that was probably
61:14 - better to use for accessibility than
61:17 - just creating an Li and putting a style
61:21 - on it to make it bold you know what we
61:31 - should put this in a grid yeah let's
61:41 - check out how we're using grid elsewhere
61:52 - oops that's my timer let's take a short
61:55 - break I'll go over some questions now on
61:57 - the live chat and then we'll finish up
61:59 - just one part of this component with
62:04 - just some some testing data just so we
62:07 - could see what it will look like and
62:09 - then we'll probably finish up the stream
62:10 - after that I'm going to try to find out
62:15 - where I left off and then answer
62:17 - questions from there
62:28 - okay MV ARMA coding says and Verma
62:35 - coding anyway let me know I'm supposed
62:37 - to say that says can you use material UI
62:40 - with react native apps and as far as I
62:43 - know the answer to that is no it looks
62:47 - like we've got some other answers for
62:51 - that as well Harshit says you can shine
62:57 - ativ base also says it's always a good
63:01 - idea to look up an awesome list for the
63:03 - stack you're using on mpg says what best
63:12 - performance between using regular CSS
63:14 - style or inline react CSS style as a way
63:17 - to styling
63:27 - I'm not exactly sure I mean I would
63:30 - guess usually regular CSS is more
63:33 - performant than anything you can do in
63:34 - JavaScript but I'm I don't have any
63:41 - numbers or anything to say like how much
63:43 - more it is that's if I had to guess
63:46 - that's what I would say our should says
63:53 - performance wise inline styles are the
63:55 - best but it doesn't give you any major
63:57 - feature like media queries etc nowadays
64:00 - we style components solution like
64:02 - emotion style components for rendering
64:04 - react styling yeah there's a lot more
64:06 - solutions for that let me reread this
64:08 - cuz Regulus is just over in Lion react
64:13 - CSS though as a reactivated styling okay
64:18 - yeah I could see that the reason I was
64:20 - thinking the inline react style would
64:22 - require more JavaScript is because
64:26 - there's JavaScript happening in the
64:28 - background to apply those Styles in line
64:33 - but I mean like for instance in this app
64:38 - it would be server-side rendered most
64:39 - likely cached and then served as HTML to
64:42 - the user or potentially if we're doing
64:48 - the client-side routing it would still
64:50 - be cached in our our service workers so
64:55 - in that case I guess it's gonna seem
64:58 - like regular inline HTML you know CSS
65:01 - styles to the user so yeah the inline
65:04 - would be faster so anytime you're not
65:09 - importing an extra file that's going to
65:12 - be faster
65:17 - but usually I don't usually have found
65:22 - like there are the difference in that is
65:26 - going to be so small like milliseconds
65:29 - right it's it's not going to be a huge
65:32 - performance increase maybe there are
65:35 - some circumstances where it would be so
65:37 - I guess I just wouldn't I don't worry
65:39 - that much about that because it's not
65:41 - really a big difference
66:03 - Julito says shouldn't state be assigned
66:05 - inside a constructor
66:21 - I'm not sure we can do state like this
66:29 - I remember listen that they're used to
66:36 - at one point you used to have to do
66:38 - state differently but this way to do
66:40 - state actually I think is the preferred
66:43 - way
66:57 - okay Nietzsche said he's using the
66:59 - babble plug-in transform class property
67:01 - so the Declaration of state outside the
67:04 - constructor is valid okay
67:05 - I remember a while a while back and one
67:08 - of the projects we had a big debate
67:10 - about this and looked up whether or not
67:13 - the way we're doing state here is the
67:17 - way we should do it and I can't remember
67:19 - all the details all I remember is that
67:21 - after much debate in research we
67:24 - concluded that this was the way we were
67:26 - gonna do state for these projects it's
67:38 - Sonique Jesus so what fixed it honestly
67:42 - I don't know what fixed it the only
67:43 - thing I did was I did a refresh I opened
67:51 - up to have tools and i refresh the page
67:53 - that's it I don't think I changed
67:56 - anything in here so I'm not really sure
68:01 - what happened but it works now
68:11 - Benny says sorry I wasn't here for the
68:13 - babble stuff oh don't worry about that
68:15 - we've done it
68:16 - honestly we set that up like a year ago
68:18 - for a project and then just kept copying
68:20 - the config over for all our future
68:22 - projects so I don't even I didn't even
68:25 - remember that we were using Babel to get
68:27 - that to work honestly and and I either
68:31 - set it up or I merged the PR that did
68:33 - set it up and somebody else did it so
68:35 - either way I still don't even remember
68:38 - and I should alright okay I didn't get
68:43 - through everything but let's finish up
68:46 - and get something on the screen here for
68:47 - this component that we can look at and
68:49 - then I'll get back to the chat and
68:51 - finish up answering any questions that
68:53 - you have so I figure we'll probably go
68:57 - maybe like a half hour longer on this
68:59 - dream depending on how soon we can get
69:01 - this done and how many questions are in
69:03 - there so if you have any questions get
69:08 - them in there you know somewhat soon
69:10 - before the stream ends all right so
69:15 - where we at here oh I couldn't find
69:24 - where my allies were okay so the grid
69:26 - stuff is where I'm gonna go next I just
69:35 - want to see
69:40 - what the syntax is I forget okay
69:43 - great container spacing and then grid
69:48 - item I and then we need a great item all
70:00 - right so our our grid is it's basically
70:03 - like column classes so if you're
70:08 - thinking CSS grid that's not really
70:10 - what's happening here these are
70:12 - components and material UI well we need
70:14 - to import them
70:25 - okay I just say they say having good set
70:29 - up in your editor for doing react or
70:31 - really any type of coding is save you a
70:33 - lot of time like having an auto
70:35 - highlight things when I forget to import
70:37 - them or it's really helpful otherwise
70:40 - you know before I had this stuff you
70:43 - know I would have forgotten to import
70:45 - that I would have tried to run it I
70:46 - would have got an error best-case
70:48 - scenario I would have remembered
70:49 - immediately I had to imported you know
70:51 - otherwise I probably would have gone
70:53 - through debugging tried to remove stuff
70:55 - only to realize that I forgot to import
70:57 - that so it takes you know it takes a few
71:01 - minutes to set up but it'll definitely
71:03 - save you a lot of time in the long term
71:05 - alright so we've got this grid here this
71:08 - grid item and I'll explain how the grid
71:12 - works in just a second so right now what
71:15 - we're saying is we have these two grid
71:18 - items and we want each one to take up 12
71:26 - columns right in the screen so we the
71:29 - system's based on 12 so this means full
71:32 - width we don't really want them to be
71:33 - full with all the time so let's say we
71:38 - want them to be full width if it's extra
71:40 - small but if the screen is let's say
71:43 - medium and up we want them to be 6 so we
71:52 - wanted to take up half the screen right
72:02 - so let's put six in here I think this
72:05 - will do it we want it to do okay so
72:08 - we're gonna save that we're gonna go
72:10 - over and we should get okay so it's
72:15 - showing us now they're stacked like that
72:18 - obviously it's not how I want to style
72:20 - I'm not worried about that right now
72:23 - what should have happened is once it
72:26 - gets larger it should have went to six
72:29 - so I did something wrong oh you know
72:34 - what it's probably MD and not just em
72:38 - and the there we go so we have our
72:49 - columns that are taking up 50% of the
72:53 - width and then once we get to a smaller
72:56 - screen it goes down like that we
72:59 - actually we could probably keep it in
73:02 - the columns for longer so let's drop
73:06 - this down instead of medium screens
73:08 - let's say small oh I don't know how I
73:16 - accidentally pasted that in there okay
73:18 - so this still works
73:20 - we'll have to see let's see how small we
73:23 - can get down with this okay so as long
73:31 - as we don't really have the course names
73:33 - getting really long I mean they can
73:35 - always wrap down on the next line that
73:37 - would be okay this should work okay and
73:44 - then it would be like that for each one
73:46 - I'm not gonna copy and paste each one of
73:47 - these what's gonna happen though is we
73:53 - would pull in this data and it would
73:59 - we'd iterate over each piece of data so
74:04 - most likely each
74:08 - each tab or I'm sorry yeah each tab so
74:13 - each year would be its own object in an
74:16 - array of objects so we would loop over
74:21 - that and for each loop it would add
74:26 - another tab you sign went through the
74:28 - loop and it would also add another one
74:30 - of these divs here and then within that
74:35 - it would show us that we would have our
74:38 - sections but we'd also loop over and put
74:42 - these allies in for each class right so
74:47 - we wouldn't actually have all this
74:49 - markup you know taking up a ton of space
74:52 - right yeah we just loop through it and
74:55 - keep adding this you know
74:59 - programmatically you would just be added
75:01 - right so that's why I'm not gonna copy
75:03 - and paste all this out if it looks right
75:06 - now and it works on one it'll be it'll
75:09 - look the same on the other ones I was I
75:12 - was thinking of like making that
75:16 - structure that array of objects and
75:20 - testing it out but I don't think I'm
75:22 - gonna do that because we've already have
75:23 - you know coming up on an hour and 15
75:25 - minutes of streaming so I'm not gonna do
75:29 - that right now basically it would be
75:32 - something trying to give an example
75:37 - where we've already done that in this
75:38 - project I can't think of it right now
75:42 - but we would use map right so we would
75:45 - we must do array dot map and then inside
75:50 - that map function that's where we would
75:53 - do all of our all of our assignments
75:56 - here and then each one of these these
75:59 - classes would be another dot map inside
76:01 - of it and so we just have to make sure
76:08 - we structure our data in the right way
76:11 - to be able to do this easily with dot
76:15 - map okay so
76:19 - let's I'm gonna submit this this stuff
76:28 - I'm gonna make a commit push it up to
76:31 - get up so that you all can see all the
76:33 - code that was added and you can mess
76:35 - with it and then that way I won't forget
76:37 - to do it and Michael says didn't we map
76:43 - in faculty list ah yes yes we did
76:45 - awesome let's see that yes I don't want
76:49 - to leave you all hanging here so thank
76:53 - you Michael so here's what okay so we're
76:59 - getting faculty data right so we're
77:02 - grabbing that from graph QL we're
77:04 - getting the faculty data we're doing dot
77:06 - map right here okay so we have this is
77:10 - our return for a react component so we
77:12 - have this stuff that looks like HTML
77:14 - okay this is JSX that's what we call it
77:17 - then if we put our curly brackets here
77:19 - we can jump back into JavaScript land
77:21 - and we can write JavaScript so we're now
77:23 - using this this constant that we've
77:26 - created up here which is just our data
77:29 - that we're pulling in from wordpress and
77:32 - it is an array of objects so we can use
77:37 - map on arrays and then once we have an
77:40 - object we can just use our dot notation
77:45 - for objects right and we can say we want
77:48 - to get faculty so we've we've assigned
77:50 - the name faculty to each object in this
77:52 - array that we're mapping over so we can
77:54 - say faculty dot node so now we've gone
77:57 - and do the dot node object and now we're
78:01 - getting slub we're also getting the
78:07 - title and the content so now this will
78:13 - end up in our page in our HTML with all
78:19 - the content for the zeroeth item in the
78:23 - faculty data array then it will go to
78:29 - the number one which is really the sec
78:31 - item right and it'll get all that data
78:34 - it'll loop through each one and we'll
78:36 - get this on the page for each one but
78:40 - it'll have the unique data of title
78:43 - content and slug so that's we're going
78:48 - to do the same thing it'll see slightly
78:51 - more complicated because we'll have to
78:52 - have nested maps because we have those
78:54 - lists so it'll look a bit longer we'll
78:57 - definitely make it its own component
79:00 - because we don't want to have one
79:02 - component that's really huge with all of
79:04 - that so it'll be its own component but
79:07 - that's what we'll do in here to clean
79:12 - this up and then it will allow us to
79:16 - have all the data will keep our
79:19 - component components really clean the
79:22 - data will get pulled in from WordPress
79:23 - and it's really kind of nice when you
79:27 - can render so much data with so little
79:31 - markup in your components but that's the
79:36 - plan so let me commit this so we're just
79:41 - gonna do a git add and yarn CM so
79:45 - normally you would just do a git commit
79:47 - command after that but we have a special
79:51 - tool set up here that helps us create a
79:54 - nice commit message so that's why it's a
79:55 - little bit different I'm gonna say we're
79:57 - gonna add a new feature and we'll say
80:00 - we've add basic
80:09 - [Music]
80:16 - had basic tab core scheduled to major
80:22 - page okay we don't need a longer
80:27 - description we didn't break anything and
80:30 - that's by default and I don't think we
80:32 - had let's double-check and see if we did
80:35 - have an issue for this I don't think we
80:37 - did but it's always good to reference it
80:52 - usually I have the link to this there we
80:57 - go
81:02 - also if you would like feel free to take
81:05 - on any of these issues and submit a pull
81:08 - request if you need help with that let
81:11 - me know if activation Oh style sample
81:21 - program sections actually this is
81:26 - regarding that so it's not going to
81:28 - close this issue so here's how we're
81:31 - gonna we're gonna say I believe if we
81:35 - put our e and then the issue number it
81:41 - will be referenced in that issue but it
81:43 - won't close the issue so this is number
81:45 - 102 102 if we were to put fix and then
81:54 - the issue number it would automatically
81:56 - close that issue as well which it's
81:59 - we're not totally done yet so I'm not
82:01 - gonna close it yet but now anybody that
82:03 - looks at that issue will be able to see
82:05 - that this commit did something that has
82:09 - to do with that issue
82:17 - so we have a lot of automated tests that
82:21 - it's running through and automatic code
82:23 - formatting so it's gone through all that
82:25 - it's passed everything and now we can do
82:27 - a git push and we're still in
82:30 - development so we still push to the
82:31 - master branch normally that's not the
82:34 - best idea like if your your project is
82:37 - already live usually people set up a
82:39 - development branch but in this case
82:41 - master is okay so now all this code is
82:45 - available on github and let's check out
82:48 - our issue and we can see here it's been
82:54 - added here we've referenced this issue
82:57 - so eighteen seconds ago so this is our
82:59 - commit and now there's a record of it
83:02 - within this issue as well so that's
83:04 - pretty cool
83:10 - all right okay cool so let me go to the
83:14 - live chat at this point I'm just gonna
83:16 - answer questions all the coding stuff is
83:18 - done we may go back to the code if we
83:20 - get a question that that references the
83:22 - code but otherwise it's question time so
83:26 - if you're not interested in interested
83:28 - in question-and-answer you know feel
83:30 - free to leave the the stream now and
83:33 - thank you so much for watching join us
83:36 - again for another stream at some point
83:38 - [Music]
83:39 - otherwise if you're gonna stick around
83:41 - please put your question in the chat now
83:43 - or help answer some questions I
83:45 - definitely do not know everything and I
83:48 - rely on your expertise for a lot oh cool
83:56 - william said the LH tag is the list
84:00 - header awesome I'm gonna put that I'm
84:07 - just gonna make a note right here age
84:16 - I'm gonna put that in there now it's not
84:19 - gonna show up on github but that'll be a
84:22 - reminder to me Thank You William in
84:25 - general if HTML has a solution to
84:28 - something it's better to use it because
84:31 - that's going to be better for screen
84:33 - readers to pick up so instead of as I
84:36 - said before using in Li just putting the
84:38 - class of header on it and then styling
84:40 - that a screen reader won't pick that up
84:42 - as the header right but it would be able
84:46 - to explain that this is the header for
84:48 - this particular list so that's it's
84:51 - definitely much better for accessibility
84:55 - that's not all you need to do for
84:57 - accessibility but it's a great start
85:08 - Harshit says have you checked out the
85:10 - new repo for JavaScript AF that we're
85:12 - constantly maintaining I haven't checked
85:14 - that out in a while I do get updates on
85:16 - the activity that happens so I'll need
85:19 - to check that out and actually are you
85:22 - sure we need to talk about that because
85:23 - I think well I'll have to check it out
85:30 - again but it might be time to do like a
85:33 - real launch if we're ready for it I'm
85:35 - okay with doing kind of like the MVP
85:37 - launcher so a Minimum Viable Product
85:39 - doing that launch and just kind of
85:42 - seeing you know what happens as I know
85:46 - you've been doing a lot of work for it
85:47 - and yeah just be I'm just interested to
85:52 - see what kind of response we get if we
85:53 - officially were to launch it and you
85:55 - know kind of put the word out there
86:16 - to
86:29 - Oh michael says is is LH still supported
86:33 - okay that's interesting I don't know
86:35 - maybe we'll have to check that out
87:03 - trying to find something new these are
87:05 - so old all right let's go past year
87:16 - let's just try em D ends article on the
87:19 - UL to see what can go in there permitted
87:23 - consonant li element
87:33 - hmm maybe not
87:52 - let's check out
88:05 - yeah so there's nothing on LH in in mdn
88:21 - okay so I'm not sure about that
88:33 - okay John Hanson says the proper way to
88:35 - title a list is to wrap a heading tag
88:38 - and the UL tag with a section tag okay
88:50 - let's check this out
89:11 - all right let's let's put that in
89:14 - quickly so we're gonna wrap the entire
89:17 - UL then in the section and the section
89:21 - tag and then within there let's move
89:34 - this up and put it here and change this
89:45 - to like in h3 so John let me know if
89:55 - this is kind of what you're thinking we
89:57 - can actually see if this okay
90:00 - I mean visually that's that's okay I
90:03 - definitely would style this a bit but I
90:05 - mean that works
90:21 - michael said even though i haven't had
90:23 - any motivation to work on my stuff for
90:25 - Udacity slash Google in the last five
90:27 - weeks
90:28 - I still remember little five weeks so
90:31 - you haven't had have you not worked on
90:34 - your stuff for five weeks that's a long
90:40 - time
91:05 - see
91:17 - anyway I think I think we have to try to
91:20 - find a way to motivate Michael to get
91:22 - back to coding so everybody throw your
91:26 - ideas for coding motivation in the chat
91:28 - now or in the comments to the video so
91:34 - yeah you gotta get back into it I do
91:37 - appreciate that you're still watching
91:38 - the stream though that's cool Benny says
91:45 - CSS grade is judging you right now
91:47 - I know but you know what for me it's
91:49 - like I always want to learn CSS grid but
91:52 - it seems like every time I start to get
91:54 - motivated to learn it I do a react
91:55 - native project and then I have to use
91:58 - flexbox again so I I just learned more
92:02 - about flexbox
92:22 - yeah Mel asked what the name of the tool
92:25 - was for better formatting commit
92:27 - messages and Nikki says it's committed
92:30 - so I just wanted to say that out loud in
92:33 - case you can't see the live chat right
92:34 - now that tool is committed in Nietzsche
92:41 - says you can also use commit lint it's
92:43 - it's very similar okay cool I haven't
92:46 - used that but thank you for the
92:48 - recommendation
92:59 - you I developer says what is that live
93:02 - I'd like to take on issues UI developer
93:05 - if you're talking about the github repo
93:07 - that I had up on the screen for this
93:09 - project the link should be in the
93:11 - description of this video
93:28 - oh and I see Benny also mentioned that
93:30 - it's posted in the description thanks
93:32 - many our heart says let's try commit
93:40 - lint this time I feel like should we try
93:44 - it on the next project I'm alright with
93:46 - that
93:55 - eruvin says can someone send somebody be
93:58 - more handsome than Jessie thank you for
94:01 - that I appreciate that it's always good
94:08 - for the ego I did shave yesterday which
94:12 - I hadn't shaved in a while I was getting
94:14 - pretty scruffy so so might be looking
94:21 - less scruffy than normal I guess
94:28 - 8-bit engineer says how long have you
94:30 - been coding with reacts let's see over a
94:39 - year now so maybe like going on a year
94:43 - and a half I think
94:50 - Benny said push the master it looks out
94:53 - a window waiting for nuclear missile to
94:55 - launch I suppose I think when you have
95:03 - like one person working on a project or
95:05 - a very small team you can get away with
95:07 - with things that you'd never want to do
95:09 - on a larger project with a large like
95:13 - especially distributed team so so yes we
95:16 - do the push to master Ahmed says how to
95:25 - get react to work in Visual Studio code
95:30 - yeah as far as like extensions are
95:36 - concerned for Visual Studio code a good
95:38 - way to start out with if you're doing
95:39 - react is to get the react food-truck
95:43 - extension and that will install a lot of
95:47 - react extensions that are very helpful
95:49 - just be careful about performance if you
95:52 - start seeing a lot of lag happen then
95:55 - maybe disable there's one part of react
96:01 - food-truck I think it's still there it
96:04 - was when I first came out automatically
96:07 - told you the size of the packages you're
96:09 - importing so if you turn that off the
96:12 - performance is fine but that's how it's
96:16 - start what's called react food-truck so
96:19 - just you know google that and install
96:22 - that and that'll be good to get you
96:24 - started using react with Visual Studio
96:27 - code criticized how easy is WordPress
96:35 - been to integrate into this project to
96:38 - be honest with you like it we've done
96:40 - similar things with WordPress before so
96:42 - it's not that hard to integrate an end
96:44 - because we're you know we were used to
96:46 - it part of the biggest issue that we're
96:50 - having right now is we we can't get some
96:57 - of the fields we're using the advanced
96:59 - custom fields plug-in to create what
97:01 - they call repeater fields and we can't
97:03 - get that day
97:04 - right now through graph QL we're using a
97:07 - plug-in called WP graph QL so we have
97:10 - not been able to get that data yet we
97:12 - can get other data with advanced custom
97:16 - fields but not that data other than that
97:18 - we've had really no problems that I can
97:20 - remember so I mean it's it's basically
97:26 - you're just getting data from an API you
97:30 - know it so it wouldn't necessarily even
97:31 - matter if it's WordPress or anything
97:33 - else where you can get data from as long
97:36 - as you can get the data and display it
97:39 - you know it's it works and so the only
97:44 - tricky parts on the WordPress end are
97:47 - just making sure that we have the right
97:49 - post types and field setup and making
97:52 - that data available but I try to use a
97:57 - minimal amount of plugins but also
97:59 - minimize the amount of custom PHP work I
98:02 - have to do so it's kind of a balance
98:04 - right now between keeping the plugins
98:07 - you know definitely I like to keep it
98:11 - under 10 plugins if I can and we've done
98:15 - more PHP work than I normally do but we
98:20 - have a lot of custom post types going on
98:35 - all right I should says people will love
98:37 - the news spoiler alert and I will also
98:39 - set up email so that you can get your
98:41 - daily dose of Awesome Devon news and
98:42 - packages that's awesome the arson I'm
98:44 - excited about the news part of it I
98:46 - think that was amazing idea that was
98:48 - your idea right horseshit I want to make
98:50 - sure you get credit for that that's a
98:53 - really really good idea I think so in
98:57 - case y'all don't know we're talking
98:58 - about a while back I happen to purchase
99:01 - the domain JavaScript AF and I asked you
99:06 - all what I should do with it and we've
99:08 - kind of come up with this website that
99:15 - pulls together a lot of really awesome
99:16 - JavaScript repositories from github and
99:19 - a lot of good news and I don't know what
99:23 - all features we have active right now so
99:25 - there's some other features that may be
99:27 - there like a lot voting on things and
99:29 - like you can add your own repos so I'm
99:34 - not sure what features we'll go live
99:36 - with the official launch but I think
99:39 - it'll be a cool site I just kind of like
99:41 - the name I thought it'd be cool to have
99:43 - that name and since I purchased as a
99:45 - thought we may as well do something with
99:46 - it and harsh it and Nicki have done an
99:48 - amazing job of working on that my
99:52 - contribution has mainly been just like
99:54 - paying for hosting um and a little a
99:58 - little bit of guidance on the on the
100:00 - project here and there I don't even know
100:02 - how many pull requests or commits I have
100:07 - but anyway I would love to be more
100:09 - involved with the project but most of my
100:11 - projects now are stuff that I get paid
100:14 - for I haven't really had time for side
100:15 - projects
100:29 - I should said we'll be setting up
100:31 - kubernetes today awesome Albert says how
100:35 - long - you're finished with this project
100:37 - I don't know I really hope soon it the
100:41 - way the project will go there won't
100:43 - really be a finished there'll be a
100:44 - launch date and then I'll probably
100:47 - continue to work on parts of it and make
100:50 - it better so some of it will be
100:53 - optimization for the speed some of it
100:58 - will be making it easier for content
101:02 - creators to upload their content through
101:05 - WordPress so I don't fixing bugs it'll
101:09 - be yeah but I'll probably move on to
101:12 - another project and then we'll come back
101:14 - to this project occasionally when
101:16 - something comes up
101:40 - oh cool John says that this this format
101:44 - is the way to do it so thank you John I
101:46 - appreciate that getting close to the end
101:52 - of the chat here so don't delay if you
101:56 - have a question or comment you'd like to
101:58 - get in there
102:14 - I lost my place sorry sometimes it just
102:17 - autoscrolls down to the bottom and I
102:19 - have to figure out where I was at okay
102:29 - Michael says below the UL tag wait so
102:34 - should should that H tag go below the UL
102:57 - I'd see Nietzsche says I've never
103:02 - browsed the web with a screen reader
103:03 - maybe I should yeah it's been a really
103:06 - long time since I've attempted to browse
103:09 - anything with a screen reader but I
103:10 - think that's a good practice for anyway
103:12 - for those who don't know a screen reader
103:14 - is a tool that allows people with vision
103:18 - impairment who can't see your website
103:21 - that allows them to have the websites
103:24 - read out to them and so if your website
103:28 - is created properly it'll make sense
103:31 - when it's read out but if you do weird
103:34 - things with your your markup it'll
103:37 - confuse the screen reader and then also
103:39 - the person who is being read to so we
103:44 - want to make sure that we do the we have
103:49 - our markup be right be correct so it's
103:52 - not enough to just have it display
103:53 - properly visually on the screen and say
103:56 - all users will never check out the code
103:58 - well that's not necessarily the case the
104:01 - screen reader will read through it and
104:03 - it doesn't matter how you styled it
104:06 - wheel with CSS you know if if you did
104:11 - this whole list and you didn't use you
104:13 - ELLs and how eyes and let's say you just
104:15 - made it all divs and then styled it to
104:17 - look like a list screener is not going
104:19 - to pick up on that being a list so it's
104:22 - just something to keep in mind that it's
104:24 - not it's not really obvious if you've
104:26 - never had to use a screen reader
104:37 - then he says Jessie can I have you as a
104:40 - wingman me to be your wingman short oh
104:46 - okay
104:47 - the the extension 4 vs code that I was
104:50 - talking about that uses up a lot of a
104:54 - lot of RAM or a lot of you know
104:56 - computing power is called import cost so
104:59 - if you do load up react food truck and
105:03 - it still comes with import costs you may
105:06 - want to disable import cost it's really
105:08 - cool but it just eats up I remember
105:11 - the stream kept lagging and we couldn't
105:13 - figure out why for a long time and then
105:15 - finally we figured out that it was in
105:16 - for cost when I used to have it on there
105:20 - so that's why I don't run it anymore
105:29 - Deon says Nikki try it meaning try to
105:34 - use the screen reader it helps to become
105:36 - a better Arya developer Arya its relates
105:39 - to accessibility it's like accessibility
105:41 - standards because you can empathize
105:44 - better with users who use screen readers
105:46 - yeah definitely a hundred percent agree
105:49 - Deon this Vishnu says where can I find
105:59 - the starter kit to follow the session I
106:04 - do we have a starting kid really
106:08 - I'm not sure this project has so many
106:13 - streams I'm not sure where the best
106:16 - place to start would be I mean it would
106:18 - be insane to try to catch up at this
106:22 - point I would say the best thing is just
106:24 - to ask a lot of questions when you watch
106:26 - and we'll try to get you caught up you
106:28 - know as we can and I'm going to try to
106:32 - go through the code as much as you can
106:33 - you can always look back on early
106:37 - commits to try to get an idea of where
106:38 - we've come from the link to the repo is
106:42 - in the description to this video
106:52 - Benny says jessie graff ql or rest or
106:55 - both so I really like graph QL better
106:59 - than rest api's because you get just
107:02 - what you want and nothing else in terms
107:05 - of the data so if I had the option use
107:08 - graph QL I will choose graph QL but rest
107:12 - api's are still awesome so I'm not
107:15 - hating on rest api's I just think that
107:19 - using graph kyo to make one API call get
107:23 - all the data you need and only the data
107:24 - you need is definitely better than
107:27 - having to make multiple API calls to hit
107:30 - different rest endpoints and then at
107:31 - each of those calls you're getting back
107:33 - a bunch of data that you potentially
107:35 - don't need
108:00 - okay so harsh it says we're not even
108:02 - using now right now so you can save
108:05 - money there or you can keep bait alive
108:07 - okay so hard so it's cool if I shut
108:11 - down the now account that would actually
108:16 - be good because that's like 25 bucks a
108:18 - month to keep that alive so I mean I
108:22 - unless there's a really good reason to
108:24 - keep it like that I mean I'd be alright
108:28 - with shuttin it down yeah I mean I don't
108:30 - mind covering the cost for this project
108:32 - until we can get some sort of like ad
108:34 - money or funding or something but I mean
108:39 - 25 bucks is 25 bucks right it's being
108:41 - you better to have it than not
109:01 - yeah okay there was some talk about what
109:03 - we're using for the search we are using
109:05 - REST API for the search because our
109:09 - graph QL set up with the WP graph KO
109:12 - plugin can't do what we what we need it
109:15 - to do so we are using a combination of
109:18 - the WordPress REST API and WP graph QL
109:25 - continuances love that domain name thank
109:28 - you I just I just thought up like I
109:32 - gotta have it right I don't know what
109:34 - made me think about it but when I
109:37 - realized dot AF domain names were a
109:39 - thing I immediately just searched for
109:42 - different domain names I can get in
109:44 - JavaScript was one of the first ones I
109:45 - searched for and I was like oh it's open
109:48 - I'm gonna get it without knowing at all
109:50 - what I was gonna do with it I just
109:51 - thought I just want to have it Ahmed
110:00 - said I've been a finished Bo's
110:02 - fundamental so I'm assuming that's
110:03 - that's Bo Karns JavaScript fundamental
110:06 - video series here on the free code camp
110:08 - YouTube channel says where to go from
110:10 - there hmm kind of depends on what you
110:13 - what you want to do have you done the
110:19 - free code camp curriculum yet because I
110:23 - mean I I think that would be good to go
110:26 - through that in terms of video series I
110:29 - mean depending on what you want to do
110:31 - you can check out some of the other
110:32 - things here on the free code camp
110:34 - channel we've been adding a lot of
110:36 - series for all different topics recently
110:41 - this particular series live coding with
110:44 - Jessie is not really great as a tutorial
110:46 - but it can be it can be good just to see
110:50 - what it's like to encounter issues and
110:53 - work through them and see like how we
110:55 - set up like a real project and go
110:58 - through the whole process of testing and
111:00 - launching it and maintaining things so
111:06 - yeah so I'm adding there's value in it
111:08 - as well but not necessarily as a
111:10 - tutorial
111:17 - snick Monty says you seem to be a bit
111:20 - down is everything fine hope everything
111:21 - as well yeah everything is cool I think
111:24 - if I seem a bit down it's probably just
111:26 - because I'm really hungry
111:28 - right now so I actually feel good other
111:30 - than being really hungry but I actually
111:34 - I'm starting to feel really good I've
111:36 - got on some different medication for my
111:39 - depression so fYI if you're new to the
111:44 - channel I do suffer from depression and
111:47 - some anxiety issues and I've I've done a
111:51 - I do a combination of therapy and
111:55 - exercise and medication to try to help
111:59 - with that and I've recently gotten on
112:00 - some some different medication that so
112:03 - I'm on antidepressants but recently I'm
112:06 - doing a like hormone replacement therapy
112:09 - and a thyroid medication I just started
112:12 - that so not sure if it's actually
112:14 - kicking in yet if it's just placebo
112:16 - effect but I'm starting to feel better
112:18 - doctor I went to said you know
112:20 - potentially if your thyroid levels are
112:22 - low and your testosterone levels are low
112:25 - that could also cause depression and
112:29 - since I've been on the antidepressants
112:31 - for so many years and I'm still
112:34 - struggling with depression he thought
112:36 - it's worth a shot so anyway this is not
112:40 - official medical advice I'm not a doctor
112:42 - I'm just letting you know what's going
112:44 - on in my life and particularly how it
112:46 - affects my coding so I think that along
112:51 - with you know working out and you know
112:54 - getting good sleep is helping right it's
112:58 - helping I'm not like you know laughing
113:01 - 24/7 and happy all the time but it seems
113:04 - like I'm doing well so thanks for asking
113:06 - though
113:23 - okay harsh it says the documentation for
113:25 - the UI library is also looking great
113:27 - have a look
113:28 - oh cool often yeah I definitely got to
113:30 - catch up on all that artists I just
113:32 - there's been so busy since since it's
113:36 - like vacation and that since I got back
113:37 - from vacation it's just between this
113:40 - project and the project for for balance
113:44 - so busy
113:54 - okay so Michael criolla saying yeah the
113:56 - H leaves should go inside the UL all
113:58 - right let's do it and let's save that
114:04 - let's check it out
114:06 - oh okay all right I mean I like that
114:09 - that it's lined up more and this will
114:12 - look a lot better once I take away these
114:14 - right so that'll just in case you're
114:17 - wondering that's just CSS class of Lists
114:23 - list type or list style type something
114:28 - like that and then you just put none I
114:29 - think it's list-style-type:none in your
114:32 - CSS and we'll put that on a ul see if it
114:35 - works and if not we'll put it on the Li
114:37 - and see if it works
114:38 - and that'll get rid of that that bullet
114:42 - point
114:51 - thanks Michael Nino says is their
114:54 - library and react it gives you a
114:55 - customizable carousel probably I don't
114:59 - know for sure
115:03 - material you I might have something I
115:06 - don't remember it they might have
115:09 - something but yeah I haven't really had
115:11 - a need for customizable carousel and
115:13 - react so I don't I don't know for sure
115:27 - Luco mania sevices what do you think
115:29 - about having a portfolio website domain
115:31 - using the new domains such as XYZ I
115:34 - think it's okay for your portfolio I
115:37 - mean it's for any website I think it's
115:40 - good like if you can use your name and
115:42 - keep it short that's fine you can't
115:46 - always get like a top-level dot-com name
115:48 - or something like that so I was really
115:51 - lucky to get it probably because my name
115:53 - is just not that common that I have
115:56 - Jesse Weigel com don't go there it's
115:58 - terrible but one day I'll fix it up but
116:04 - yeah I think it would be better to get
116:08 - the domain name that you want regardless
116:10 - of whether it's about X Y Z or dot IO or
116:13 - do whatever you want it to be then to
116:15 - try to have some weird long name and
116:18 - have it be a.com
116:20 - that's just my opinion speaking of like
116:23 - if I saw somebody's portfolio on a you
116:26 - know on the resume and I saw the link
116:28 - I'm way more likely to go to it if it's
116:30 - just short no matter what the ending is
116:32 - so that's important to me you know on
116:38 - the on the side of like if I was
116:40 - interviewing in for a new developer
116:42 - position or something but I'm not sure
116:45 - there might be some other factors that
116:49 - I'm not seeing
117:00 - world says hard is the honorary
117:02 - boss yet
117:04 - harsh its knowledge of coding is quite
117:09 - amazing so usually when I should
117:11 - recommend something I for sure try it
117:14 - don't always go with it under percent
117:16 - percent of the time but definitely try
117:18 - it and most of the time end up going
117:20 - with it
117:30 - michael says still 44 out watching after
117:32 - 90 minutes must fear record yeah well we
117:34 - have 45 now thank you everyone for
117:37 - sticking around and watching that's
117:39 - awesome
117:40 - usually people can't handle the really
117:42 - long streams we're going up on two hours
117:45 - almost now so all right when I said it
117:47 - to people drop down Deon says way to
117:53 - seize the day with the domain name
117:54 - thanks John says Jesse's videos give you
118:01 - the coding bug to try out new things
118:04 - hear that Michael Creole watch a bunch
118:07 - and you'll be good to go I hike cool
118:15 - Benny says thanks one more sub from here
118:18 - thank you for the subscription I
118:19 - appreciate that I will stalk you for a
118:22 - react native CSS grid really shines when
118:25 - you combine with flexbox one day I will
118:27 - inject it into react native personally
118:29 - sweet that'd be awesome
118:32 - Steven says why depression I had no idea
118:34 - honestly I I don't know why I don't know
118:37 - why I've depression
118:40 - late in my late teenage years it started
118:44 - and I didn't really know what was going
118:46 - on I started having panic attacks and
118:51 - yeah so I've been trying to deal with it
118:53 - ever since I tried to do it without
118:55 - medication for a couple years and you
118:58 - know kind of got worse and so then I
119:01 - tried with the medication with the
119:02 - counseling the best thing for me that
119:04 - helps is stay on a good schedule get
119:07 - exercise medication counseling all like
119:10 - together if I can do all those things
119:13 - consistently together
119:14 - I usually feel good if I start to slack
119:18 - off then I feel bad again so yeah but I
119:25 - like to bring it up because I know some
119:27 - of you also struggle with it and so I
119:31 - think it's helpful it kind of be open
119:33 - about it and I'm in a position where I
119:35 - can be open about it and not face you
119:38 - know any kind of social stigma for it
119:40 - I'm not afraid of being described
119:42 - against at my job for it or anything
119:44 - like that so not everybody's in that
119:47 - position so I figure out you know I may
119:49 - as well take advantage of it why can't
119:51 - you know just share share with everybody
120:00 - Deon says depression is a bummer I need
120:03 - to get some medication myself yeah and I
120:06 - mean I'm not like I said I'm not a
120:07 - doctor so definitely you know check with
120:09 - your doctor and everything you know
120:11 - different people have depression for
120:13 - different reasons and there's different
120:14 - things going on you know so definitely
120:16 - just you know get to a doctor you can
120:19 - trust that can check out and try to try
120:22 - different things just be patient with it
120:24 - because it takes a while to figure out
120:26 - like what medications work and what
120:29 - dosages work well and you know you got
120:31 - to give them time to work so it's it's
120:35 - kind of a long process and sometimes you
120:38 - have to adjust along the way just
120:40 - medication it's just the way you're
120:42 - treating it but it's it's worth it to
120:47 - try you know just if you're struggling
120:50 - with that you know don't give up keep
120:51 - trying even if you can feel good just
120:55 - for a little while it's worth it michael
121:01 - says my wife walked in when you're
121:02 - talking about depression she started
121:03 - pointing at me and told her she needed
121:06 - to see see the stuff before me he says
121:16 - by the way I love that indentation
121:17 - indicator vs code has that highlights at
121:21 - what level you are yeah really useful
121:23 - and since and Jessie you need some
121:25 - bracket pair colorizer in your life if
121:27 - you don't have it already yeah you know
121:31 - what that's been mentioned before I
121:33 - don't think I have it at least not on
121:36 - this computer so I'll have to remember
121:38 - to install that
121:45 - all right michael says the location of
121:48 - the header is more about arias like
121:49 - accessibility than formatting cool I
121:53 - mean I yeah I think it's a nice bonus
121:56 - that the formatting happens to look
121:58 - better in that case to sneak Monty says
122:06 - me to anxiety and a constant feel of
122:10 - worthlessness mainly after a traumatic
122:12 - event that happened two years ago mental
122:14 - issues are crazy hard to think to deal
122:16 - with I never had them before the second
122:19 - year period you know what uh mcmoney if
122:22 - you haven't already I'd recommend
122:25 - researching a little bit about PTSD so
122:28 - post-traumatic stress disorder my wife
122:32 - had the same issues after she had some
122:35 - really crazy health issues with the the
122:37 - birth of our last child so you may be
122:43 - dealing with that especially if there
122:45 - was an event that that triggered all
122:47 - that so look up that and like some of
122:51 - the treatments and things because that
122:53 - might be a good way like if you haven't
122:56 - already like I'm not a doctor or
122:58 - psychologist or anything I just know
122:59 - what my wife went through and so it
123:04 - might be an area you just want to learn
123:06 - more about
123:13 - lugo mania 7 says thank you Jessie you
123:16 - welcome the problem mcmoney says hope
123:23 - from the bottom of my heart that you
123:25 - find peace you have helped me a lot to
123:27 - learn react thank you and and I hope the
123:30 - same thing for you as well
123:36 - Jordan asks what I miss uh huh I guess a
123:39 - lot we've been streaming for over two
123:40 - hours now so you may want to just go
123:43 - back and re-watch I don't know that I
123:46 - could sum everything up right now the
123:51 - whole world's also said it sounds like
123:52 - PTSD yeah
123:55 - Phoenix says finally down to my exams
123:59 - for this semester hooray congratulations
124:01 - I hope you did well well wall root what
124:10 - were you combo come out I'm really sorry
124:13 - I probably just messed up your name
124:14 - please let me know how I should
124:15 - pronounce it but anyway they say what's
124:18 - your take on progressive Web Apps PWA
124:20 - you think that it'll replace native apps
124:23 - I don't know
124:25 - native apps are so entrenched in
124:28 - people's lives right now it will take a
124:31 - while I think it'll take a while so I'm
124:34 - I mean I don't think they'll be around
124:35 - forever but it's gonna take a huge shift
124:37 - like those are less who are developers
124:39 - and understand them I think are way more
124:42 - open to them than the average person
124:44 - who's just like you download an app like
124:46 - that's that's how it is so it's
124:51 - definitely going to take if if let's say
124:54 - Apple and Google on their mobile
124:56 - operating systems really pushed it it
124:59 - could happen but if that doesn't happen
125:01 - I think it's going to be a hard sell
125:03 - because people generally just continue
125:05 - to do what they've always done so unless
125:09 - there's a really good reason for them to
125:11 - start using progressive web apps more
125:13 - they're they're gonna stay with what
125:15 - they have so anyway that's my my kind of
125:19 - opinion on it and I'm take it for what
125:23 - it is I'm no expert right
125:37 - Phoenix says also apparently going
125:40 - through that stressful period of my life
125:41 - imposter syndrome existential crisis
125:44 - feeling like I don't know anything
125:45 - yep all those are my daily thoughts hang
125:48 - in there Phoenix I mean I think I think
125:50 - most of us has been through stuff like
125:52 - that the imposter syndrome gets better
125:57 - at least in my case it gets better
126:03 - really since I started live-streaming my
126:06 - imposter syndrome has gotten better
126:07 - because I've laid everything out there
126:10 - for everyone to see all my code even
126:13 - some like Mia my personal issues things
126:15 - like that and people still watch my show
126:18 - they're still positive about it and so
126:20 - my fear that people will figure out that
126:23 - I have no idea what I'm doing has been
126:27 - proven to be a false a false fear right
126:32 - so that's helped me to get over that so
126:37 - I think the more work you do the more
126:39 - good work you do that you're proud of
126:42 - and that other people like it will help
126:45 - you get over that imposter syndrome
126:54 - Stephen says well Jessie had no idea you
126:59 - ever had it meaning the depression just
127:01 - remember your stream led me to my first
127:03 - front-end programming job so you got
127:06 - that hashtag hype the stream now I'm
127:09 - learning react Thank You Stephen
127:11 - honestly comments like that really do
127:13 - help a lot in this this stream has
127:16 - helped me a lot one of the things with
127:17 - depression is you get depressed like you
127:19 - don't want to see anybody you just want
127:21 - to be by yourself and not do anything
127:24 - and that just makes you more depressed
127:26 - so me wanting to keep streaming for you
127:32 - all has helped me to like I have a
127:37 - community now you know I have you all
127:39 - that I talk to you know very frequently
127:41 - and it forces me out of that state of I
127:46 - don't want to talk to anybody or do
127:47 - anything you know so and it forced to be
127:51 - honestly it forces me to act like I'm
127:53 - not depressed because I don't want to be
127:55 - active pressure on the stream that's you
127:57 - know I don't want to spread my
127:57 - depression right I want to spread
127:59 - happiness so it's literally I like take
128:03 - caffeine and try to pump myself up I
128:07 - listen to upbeat music and I try to act
128:10 - happy even from not and sometimes just
128:13 - that acting helps me to feel happier so
128:17 - I'm always exhausted after I stream
128:19 - which y'all don't see that but like when
128:21 - I saw screaming I just sink back in my
128:23 - chair and just catch my breath right it
128:26 - takes a lot out of me but I think it's
128:31 - it's helpful the stream has helped me in
128:33 - comments like that helped me you all
128:36 - [Music]
128:37 - like I feel like we we on it like we
128:40 - have a relationship right we don't see
128:42 - each other in person but you know we we
128:44 - have this connection now and it's real
128:47 - it's it's important connection so I
128:49 - don't want to get all emotional on y'all
128:52 - in the stream but I just want to let you
128:54 - know that I really appreciate you all
128:55 - and it definitely helps me not just in
128:59 - the coding you know but also with the
129:01 - depression and and everything as well
129:08 - Phoenix says coding helps me get through
129:10 - it you have no idea how helpful you are
129:12 - at this time I feel lucky to have top
129:14 - loader of your life James the right time
129:16 - Phoenix I appreciate you saying that I'm
129:19 - really really happy that I could help
129:25 - Eva says are we talking about coding or
129:28 - psychological problems both we normally
129:31 - just talk about coding but occasionally
129:33 - we do talk about psychological problems
129:36 - so if you're not into that right now
129:39 - that's cool don't worry about it we will
129:41 - talk about coding like 90% of the time
129:44 - we talk about coding so it's mainly
129:48 - coding but if you want to talk about
129:50 - psychological issues we do too as well
129:54 - so yeah because I think other things in
130:00 - life affect coding I mean it's just the
130:03 - way it is on MTG says when or what kind
130:10 - of project to use these library for
130:13 - state management and react like Redux
130:15 - because I see you're not using it in
130:16 - this project I'm on a project right now
130:19 - and sometimes I got confused about using
130:20 - it or not when I find that I'm passing
130:24 - props down multiple levels then I
130:28 - consider using state management if I'm
130:31 - not doing that I don't worry about it in
130:34 - general right so if the project isn't
130:37 - gotten like that big that I need to do
130:40 - that I just go without it because it's
130:41 - it's simpler to not use it I have use
130:44 - Redux before I like Redux it's a little
130:47 - tricky but yeah so that's that's usually
130:51 - how I decide whether I want to use state
130:54 - management library or not
131:02 - Carlos says hello Jesse hi everyone I'm
131:04 - late but I managed to get the live feed
131:06 - hey Carlos how's it going Steven says I
131:11 - do need to tweet you some of my sites
131:13 - I've made with the company so you can
131:14 - see what I'm creating I keep forgetting
131:16 - to do that up to 39 new sites and six
131:18 - months of work oh yeah awesome Steven I
131:20 - definitely want to see those so yeah if
131:23 - you if you get a chance and remember I
131:25 - yeah send me those michael says don't
131:31 - most coders have psychological issues I
131:33 - don't know I don't really know I think a
131:36 - lot of people do
131:38 - so I guess coders would do is do as well
131:40 - I've never seen anything that said
131:43 - coders are more likely to have
131:44 - psychological issues but I don't know
131:46 - mental Health's a big deal right and
131:48 - we're learning more about it than we
131:50 - ever have now so I think it's good to
131:55 - talk to talk more about it you know it
131:58 - it's it's gonna help people maybe you
131:59 - don't realize that they even have issues
132:01 - maybe realize like hey wow now I know
132:05 - what's going on with me and and I know
132:07 - I'm you know I'm not alone in this and
132:09 - there's ways to treat it so I think it's
132:12 - I think it's getting better for people
132:16 - to be able to find help and in different
132:18 - ways to treat these things yeah Mel says
132:22 - you just got a new subscriber I have no
132:24 - idea of your coding skills but you sound
132:26 - honest that's more than enough for me
132:27 - thank you I appreciate it
132:30 - yeah I don't know about my coding skills
132:32 - either I build things and they work my
132:35 - boss is happy so that's all I know
132:38 - whether or not I'm better than anybody
132:40 - else I don't know and it doesn't really
132:43 - matter
132:45 - Carlos says I'm actually a clinical
132:47 - psychologist so coding and psychological
132:49 - issues is 100% good for me even if we
132:51 - talk about anything else it's nice to
132:53 - hear it's nice to hear you Wow Carlos
132:57 - that's awesome that's awesome well maybe
132:59 - we can talk about psychological issues
133:04 - sometime Carlos as long as you don't
133:09 - charge me for it since that way I'm just
133:12 - joking
133:14 - michael says sorry Jesse didn't mean to
133:18 - make this a group session oh don't worry
133:20 - about it
133:20 - harsh it says kind of scary to listen to
133:22 - this about the mental issues I'm sorry I
133:26 - didn't mean to freak anybody out
133:29 - Stephen says I will say I was really
133:32 - scared making a career change didn't
133:33 - trust myself and what I knew it did take
133:36 - me some time to build that confidence
133:38 - Carlos is your thing Aloha yeah yeah I
133:42 - mean it's that's that's how it is
133:45 - sometimes
133:46 - career changes and things are huge like
133:48 - it's huge whoa what were you says is it
133:55 - advisable to have a side project while
133:57 - working full-time I'm doing it right now
133:59 - and I've done it in the past it's just
134:01 - it's a lot of work if I'm gonna do a
134:04 - side project I'm working full-time I
134:06 - need I need to have a really good reason
134:08 - mostly like I need to be getting paid a
134:10 - lot because that's a time a lot of time
134:12 - away from my family and I need to be
134:14 - able to show something for it like hey
134:16 - family like we can buy this thing that
134:19 - you all wanted or go on this vacation or
134:22 - something because I did this so for me
134:26 - that's what it needs to be for some
134:29 - people maybe it's this is my path to a
134:31 - promotion or getting a job or making the
134:33 - career change it kind of depends on your
134:36 - situation but just be aware like when
134:39 - you put in your regular full day of
134:40 - coding trying to do anything after that
134:42 - it's pretty it's tough it's not
134:46 - impossible but it's difficult and you
134:48 - could easily get burnt out Edward said
134:54 - I'm new here what is this broadcasts all
134:55 - about just really quickly this broadcast
134:58 - is about me doing my everyday work as a
135:01 - full full time of front-end developer
135:05 - and so we do the projects we talk about
135:09 - them together and I answer questions and
135:12 - we discuss things so that's kind of what
135:15 - it's about
135:16 - and I mess up a lot and we get we go
135:19 - through it and try to solve the problems
135:21 - together Stephen says teaching K through
135:25 - five to full-time
135:26 - programmer was a big change really scary
135:29 - move but I don't regret it
135:30 - Wow I'd say that is definitely a huge
135:32 - change but I'm glad that you like it you
135:35 - don't regret it all right we're getting
135:40 - we're getting to the bottom of the chat
135:43 - here we just have a few more comments
135:44 - and I think we'll wrap things up we have
135:47 - a hello from Ukraine how long will it
135:48 - take to learn to code as a front-end dev
135:50 - I can't give you time it depends on like
135:53 - how many hours a day you have to
135:55 - dedicate to it what you know already and
136:00 - like how how easy it is for you to pick
136:04 - up new concepts so really not sure but
136:07 - you know as soon as you can convince
136:09 - somebody that they should pay you to
136:12 - build a website for them then then your
136:14 - friend right I mean I don't know there's
136:17 - different definitions but to me like
136:20 - once you learn enough to actually build
136:22 - something of value to somebody and and
136:25 - get paid for it then at that point your
136:28 - developer at least a professional
136:30 - developer in the sense of the word like
136:32 - a professional is someone who gets paid
136:34 - to do what they do
136:38 - Carlos says I have to change from
136:41 - clinical psychology to programming 100%
136:43 - I changed from my country to my wife
136:45 - country so I have to do something else
136:46 - here it's scary that's how life is and
136:48 - learning oh okay yeah for sure that it
136:54 - that you know life is is dealing with
136:57 - change
136:58 - Moli it says hi hey how's it going
137:01 - Edward said I'm from Ukraine - awesome
137:05 - Carlos's programming is a great asset
137:07 - for life work in any place on earth
137:10 - definitely amaura says how long will it
137:13 - take you to get a master with react how
137:16 - do you get how do you master Java
137:19 - scripts as well I don't really know that
137:22 - that answer is going to be different for
137:24 - everybody in terms of how long it takes
137:25 - to master it and when it comes to
137:27 - programming languages that that change
137:29 - right that can get updated like at what
137:33 - point do you really master that can you
137:34 - master it I think the the right thing to
137:37 - way look at is I'm always going to learn
137:40 - more right I'm always gonna strive for
137:43 - mastery knowing that you may never get
137:46 - there because there's always new things
137:47 - to learn nikki says thanks everyone got
137:52 - to go bye
137:52 - and go go Belgium for the World Cup
137:56 - see you later Nikki thanks for watching
137:57 - thanks for hanging in there for so long
137:59 - with two hours and 15 minutes now I got

138:24 - project suggestions for mine stack
138:26 - please let little hit no I don't really
138:30 - I don't know anything I've stopped my
138:31 - head probably because I've been
138:32 - streaming for so long my brain is
138:34 - starting to get emotional
138:44 - Stephen says it has taken me a couple
138:47 - years of JavaScript still not even close
138:49 - yet but I have a four year old so I only
138:52 - do about an hour on each day in two
138:55 - hours each day on the weekend oh cool
138:58 - cool yeah I totally understand how it is
139:00 - to try to do coding stuff with kids so I
139:06 - can definitely sympathize with you their
139:09 - kids are wonderful they're awesome but
139:12 - for some reason my almost 2 year old
139:16 - wants to help me code which means she
139:19 - bangs on the keyboard and says help that
139:21 - helped edit so it's really cute but not
139:24 - easy to code all right I'm at the bottom
139:29 - of the chat now and I definitely need to
139:31 - end so I can eat something and get all
139:34 - my stuff prepared for my 3:00 p.m.
