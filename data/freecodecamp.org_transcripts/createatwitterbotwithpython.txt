00:00 - today we are going to create a twitter
00:02 - bot that will post images of models onto
00:06 - a twitter account for us so this is what
00:08 - we're going to end up with when we're
00:09 - finished here on the left here we see a
00:12 - script that is going to scrape a web
00:14 - page for images and it will save them in
00:17 - a folder for us on the right here we
00:19 - have our have our python bot script
00:22 - which is going to go ahead and post
00:24 - those images to our twitter account at a
00:27 - set time interval okay so i'll run it
00:30 - for you guys so we can see how it works
00:32 - here and then we're going to go and
00:33 - review each line uh each line of the
00:36 - code line by line
00:38 - so here is what we are going to end up
00:41 - with
00:41 - this is the account i've got set up here
00:43 - called the modelbot and we're going to
00:45 - send out our first tweet in just a
00:47 - minute here so let's go ahead and get
00:50 - this and get this script running so here
00:53 - we have i'll show you guys right now i
00:54 - have it set at a time interval of three
00:57 - seconds so every three seconds is going
00:59 - to tweet obviously if we were running
01:00 - this on a separate server we would
01:02 - change that time interval because
01:04 - tweeting every three seconds might be
01:06 - considered a little excessive but
01:08 - let's go ahead and run this here
01:10 - so first off i want to show you guys
01:12 - we'll run this we'll run the script
01:14 - that'll scrape the images first okay
01:16 - so let's go ahead i'm going to show you
01:18 - guys the the desktop here
01:21 - and um just to show you so you can see
01:23 - the folder that we've got
01:25 - so right here we've got our empty folder
01:27 - or not empty folder but we have our two
01:29 - scripts in our folder
01:31 - so let's go ahead here and now run our
01:34 - script that is going to get the pictures
01:36 - for us
01:37 - okay
01:38 - so here we go
01:40 - and so right now it is going to this web
01:43 - page that we that i specified here and
01:45 - it's pulling all the photos from that
01:47 - web page and creating a folder that will
01:49 - pop up in this in this directory here so
01:52 - there you see our folder just got popped
01:54 - up and now when we open it we have all
01:57 - these pictures here from the website
01:58 - that we scraped off the website off the
02:00 - website
02:02 - alright so now that we've got those
02:03 - pictures let's go ahead and run our
02:05 - other script that is going to
02:07 - be the twitter bot for us
02:10 - okay so we've got that and
02:13 - now as we saw before don't currently
02:15 - have any tweets um for this for this
02:18 - twitter bot but now we're going to go
02:20 - ahead and run this guy right here
02:24 - all right
02:25 - and this is going to go ahead and send
02:28 - out tweets for us at a three second
02:29 - interval so let's go ahead and
02:33 - refresh our page here
02:35 - and there we go already got two tweets
02:37 - coming out and
02:39 - refresh again another tweet and there we
02:42 - go
02:43 - so again you can adjust that time
02:44 - interval as you want uh depending on how
02:47 - many tweets you want to send out and or
02:49 - what you're tweeting about
02:51 - okay so let's go back and
02:53 - uh close out that script before we get
02:56 - some serious
02:57 - uh twitter overload here
02:59 - and just one sec
03:04 - okay so there we go that will finish
03:07 - that off so now we're going to review
03:09 - our scripts here and so if you guys want
03:11 - to make this we're going to walk through
03:12 - step by step how you would go about
03:14 - doing that and so we can understand each
03:16 - line of the code here so we'll start
03:19 - with how we scrape the images from the
03:22 - web page so if depending on what kind of
03:24 - twitter bot you want to make we can or
03:26 - you can use different things so in this
03:28 - case i wanted it to send out images but
03:30 - you can also do there are also twitter
03:32 - bots that'll send out any kind of thing
03:34 - so some do like poetry some do
03:37 - memes some do a bunch of different
03:38 - things so whatever you guys want your
03:40 - twitter about to do or be
03:42 - you want to go ahead and get that data
03:44 - that it's going to that is going to be
03:46 - used to send out those tweets
03:48 - so as far as this script goes we'll
03:50 - review this one quickly and then get
03:52 - over to the to the bot itself but we
03:54 - have a url here that we are moving to
03:57 - and this is the url that has the
03:59 - pictures on it
04:00 - so you see we can go to this quickly
04:02 - here and we'll take a look at that
04:07 - all right
04:10 - so here's the website and it is grabbing
04:12 - pictures from this website here
04:15 - based there it is based on our url so
04:17 - it's grabbing these pictures scraping
04:19 - these pictures off the website and
04:20 - creating a folder for us and saving them
04:23 - to that so we go ahead we do that we're
04:25 - using the module uh we're using the
04:26 - request module the beautiful suit module
04:29 - and the os module so in this case
04:32 - request is a module that allows you to
04:33 - make requests to web pages a beautiful
04:36 - soup is a module for us
04:39 - kind of downloading the html that makes
04:41 - up those web pages so we can easily
04:43 - parse through that and find what we want
04:45 - and then os is used to create the folder
04:48 - in the directory that our scripts are in
04:51 - so we've got that url go to that url
04:54 - in our next line here we have the page
04:56 - so this is where we're actually
04:58 - requesting the url so we're requesting a
05:00 - response from the server on that page
05:02 - and then we are creating a our soup
05:05 - which is the html that makes up that
05:08 - website that we requested so once we get
05:10 - that we are using the bs4 uh method find
05:14 - all which is going to find all the
05:16 - images that are on that web page for us
05:18 - and then it is going ahead and we're
05:20 - going to create the directory that we
05:21 - want to store those images in okay so
05:24 - what this is doing is it's saying if the
05:27 - models folder does not exist in the
05:30 - folder that we are currently in then we
05:31 - want to make that folder and then
05:34 - otherwise we want to just change our
05:36 - current directory to that folder that
05:38 - we're in because when your python script
05:40 - saves files or saves uh pictures in this
05:43 - case to the folder it's going to save
05:45 - them unless you specify otherwise to the
05:47 - current working directory or the current
05:49 - folder that you're in
05:51 - so we go ahead and we change uh we
05:53 - change our current directory to the
05:55 - models folder that we created so next up
05:57 - here we have a variable that is going to
05:59 - be used to uh
06:02 - as we add our pictures we want to
06:04 - specify them being slightly different
06:06 - obviously because we don't want to
06:07 - overwrite the same file as we save our
06:09 - pictures so we have our x equals zero
06:11 - and we're going to increment that for
06:12 - each picture in order to save each
06:14 - picture as one two three etc
06:17 - okay so now we have a loop here and what
06:19 - we're doing with this loop is we are
06:21 - saying for each image that is in our uh
06:24 - image tags soup that we have here so
06:27 - this is returning us a nice list of
06:30 - a nice list of image tags and that but
06:33 - we don't have that's just the raw html
06:35 - we don't we want to extract the the
06:37 - source url from each of those um
06:40 - image elements okay so we're going to go
06:42 - ahead here and so for each image for
06:45 - each image in that list or for each
06:47 - image
06:49 - html element that is in that in that
06:51 - list then we want to go ahead here and
06:52 - we want to get the source so we're
06:54 - saying we're declaring a variable called
06:56 - url and we are setting that to be the
06:59 - source of the image so in this case we
07:01 - can reference the source attribute or
07:03 - src attribute of the
07:06 - of the image tags with our bs4 module by
07:10 - specifying the image and then specifying
07:13 - within within square brackets what the
07:16 - attribute that we want to get is
07:19 - so then once we have that url we want to
07:21 - go ahead and we want to navigate
07:22 - directly to that url then we want to go
07:25 - ahead and so if the source status code
07:27 - equals 200 so if we get a response there
07:29 - we want to go ahead and we want to open
07:31 - up a new file and this is the file that
07:34 - that is a jpeg file so you can see here
07:36 - with open
07:37 - model plus string x so we have just the
07:40 - model text plus the current value that
07:43 - our x integer is at so remember we're
07:46 - incrementing that in order to create new
07:48 - uh create new image files
07:50 - and we want to save that with the dot
07:52 - jpeg extension and we want to be able to
07:54 - write to that file so we're going to go
07:56 - ahead and we're going to create that
07:58 - jpeg file and we want to specify that
08:00 - we're going to write to it so then we're
08:02 - going to go ahead and we're going to say
08:04 - um f dot write so what this is is it's
08:06 - opening up this file and it's saying
08:08 - let's represent this file that we opened
08:10 - up as as f so we're going to say f dot
08:13 - right so we want to write to that file
08:15 - and then we want to write the
08:17 - the request that we got the content of
08:19 - the request that we got so that is
08:21 - what's going to capture the image that
08:23 - loads when we navigate to that url
08:26 - after that we want to close the file and
08:28 - then we want to increment x by one so we
08:30 - can move on to our next image file
08:32 - so if at any point during that
08:35 - loop there is some
08:36 - some exception thrown then we just want
08:39 - to continue our loop with the next
08:40 - picture because for some of these images
08:43 - uh they won't always get a proper
08:44 - request or there will be some other
08:46 - small error that occurs when we are
08:48 - navigating to that page that the images
08:51 - is located on so if that is the case
08:53 - then we want to go ahead and we just
08:54 - want to pass over and pass over that
08:56 - image and move to the next one
08:58 - okay so that does it for our our image
09:00 - scraping so now we're going to go ahead
09:02 - here and talk about our model script so
09:05 - this is the uh the script that creates
09:07 - our twitter bot so we're using three
09:10 - libraries in this case we're using the
09:12 - tweepy library which is a python library
09:14 - for accessing twitter via the api so in
09:18 - api is just an application programming
09:21 - interface which is essentially
09:23 - a lot of code that is written to
09:26 - directly access certain data within the
09:29 - uh
09:30 - within twitter and to be able to make
09:31 - certain um to be able to form certain
09:34 - operations such as posting new status
09:36 - updates posting pictures
09:38 - a following
09:40 - and a bunch of other things you can do
09:41 - on twitter so we're going to use the
09:42 - tweepy library in order to make our code
09:44 - more efficient
09:46 - next up here we have the time module
09:48 - which we are using to specify how much
09:50 - time we want to uh rest in between our
09:53 - tweets and then we have the os module in
09:55 - order to move over to our folder that is
09:59 - that contains our our pictures that we
10:01 - scraped off the web
10:03 - so next up here this is an important
10:04 - part for creating this guys so we have
10:07 - the credentials and the way what this is
10:10 - is how you log into your twitter account
10:13 - that your new twitter bot account that
10:14 - you created so if you guys are building
10:16 - this go ahead and create a new account
10:19 - on twitter and then you want to go ahead
10:21 - once you've created that account you
10:23 - want to navigate over to this page here
10:25 - so that's
10:26 - apps.twitter.com backslash app backslash
10:29 - new and just navigate to that page and
10:31 - it's going to bring this up here
10:33 - so what this is is you need to create a
10:36 - or you need to tell twitter that you're
10:37 - creating an application in order to get
10:41 - what are known as the api keys so you
10:43 - can access your account directly to the
10:46 - api interface that twitter provides
10:49 - so in this case you create a name for
10:52 - your bot that you're creating you create
10:54 - a description for your bot and then you
10:56 - can just throw in any old website you
10:58 - want if you want to go ahead and create
10:59 - a website specifically for your bot go
11:02 - ahead and do that and specify that there
11:03 - but otherwise go ahead and throw in
11:05 - whatever website and do make sure that
11:08 - you type in https colon backslash
11:10 - backslash not just www whatever name of
11:14 - the website you are creating is because
11:16 - otherwise it's going to throw you a
11:17 - little error there
11:18 - then you just go ahead and check this
11:20 - off and create your twitter application
11:22 - so once you do that you're going to have
11:23 - access to a couple of these keys here
11:25 - there is a tab that you want to navigate
11:27 - to once you're within that that will
11:29 - generate these keys for you so you can
11:31 - access the twitter api from within your
11:33 - script
11:34 - so that'll give you your consumer key
11:36 - your consumer secret your access token
11:38 - and your access secret so these are just
11:40 - long strings of numbers and letters that
11:42 - are going to be used to access your
11:44 - twitter api so go ahead and create
11:47 - variables to represent those
11:49 - those keys and those secrets and then go
11:52 - ahead and
11:53 - store those strings within those
11:55 - variables
11:56 - so next up here we're going to use
11:58 - a couple different functions from the
12:00 - tweepy library in order to log into our
12:03 - api so the first one is the oauth
12:06 - handler so you see tp here which we said
12:09 - up at the top here we want to import
12:10 - tweepy as tp so when we're referencing
12:13 - the tweepy library from within our code
12:14 - we can reference it just by the by tp
12:17 - instead of having to type out tweepy and
12:19 - so we have tp.o off handler which is how
12:22 - we're going to
12:24 - log into our
12:26 - or our authenticate with the twitter
12:28 - server
12:29 - in order to log into our account so next
12:31 - up here we want to take that
12:33 - off that that value that we are
12:36 - representing with auth and we want to go
12:38 - ahead and set the access token again
12:41 - this is using a function within the
12:42 - tweep library and that specifies two
12:45 - parameters which are the access token
12:46 - and the access secret so you go ahead
12:48 - and you add those in there and then you
12:50 - have then you're ready to log in so your
12:52 - next line here is to create the api
12:55 - variable and then go ahead and log in
12:57 - via the uh tweepy api function so again
13:01 - we specify uh tp.api
13:04 - with auth as our
13:06 - as our single parameter and remember we
13:09 - set the consumer key the consumer secret
13:11 - and the access token the access secret
13:13 - with these two lines above
13:15 - so now we've logged into our twitter api
13:18 - so what we want to do is post these
13:20 - images so in this case we want to go
13:22 - ahead and change the current directory
13:24 - that we are in to the models folder that
13:27 - we saved all our images that we scraped
13:29 - in so in this case here we are using the
13:31 - os dot
13:33 - chdir
13:35 - function which is basically just saying
13:37 - change the current folder that we are
13:38 - operating in to the models folder so in
13:41 - this case your script first starts
13:42 - running when it's first runs it's uh
13:45 - it's the current directory that it runs
13:47 - in is the directory that the scripts
13:48 - themselves are located in so remember we
13:50 - created that folder in that same folder
13:52 - that the scripts are in but now we want
13:54 - to move into that folder that we created
13:56 - that has the pictures so we're going to
13:57 - move into that folder with that line and
13:59 - then next up here we're going to loop
14:01 - over the files that are within that
14:04 - folder in order to post them each at a
14:07 - post each
14:08 - each picture because in this case
14:09 - they're going to be pictures at a set
14:11 - time interval so we go ahead here and we
14:13 - say for we're creating a variable called
14:16 - model image which is going to represent
14:18 - each file as we iterate over the files
14:20 - that are within the uh folder that we
14:23 - created
14:24 - and so we're going to say for each image
14:26 - that is in the or for model image in the
14:30 - in the directory list so we're using the
14:32 - uh the list
14:33 - dir the list dir function that is part
14:36 - of the os module again which will list
14:39 - all the files that are within our folder
14:41 - for us
14:43 - so that allows us to iterate over them
14:45 - and in this case we want to use again
14:46 - the tweepy function which is the update
14:49 - with media function
14:51 - so
14:52 - as far as this goes there are a couple
14:54 - different functions that are there
14:55 - multiple functions you can use for the
14:57 - different things you want to do on
14:58 - twitter with tweepy but in this case we
15:01 - want to use the update with media
15:02 - function in order to paste post a photo
15:04 - this can also be used to post a video or
15:06 - post a gif so we can go ahead and say
15:08 - update with media another function you
15:10 - can use is update status or update
15:12 - underscore status and then you pass a
15:15 - string as your parameter
15:17 - which is going to be just whatever text
15:18 - you want to post say you just wanted to
15:20 - send out a text based tweet you would
15:23 - use update status
15:25 - so after we go ahead and we send out our
15:27 - tweet then we want to go ahead and
15:30 - sleep so that's going to tell our script
15:32 - to basically
15:34 - pause for that amount of time and then
15:36 - continue running
15:38 - so in this case we have our loop that is
15:39 - going to continue to run continue to um
15:42 - move through the folder that contains
15:44 - our images and tweet them out but in
15:46 - between each tweet this is where you
15:47 - specify how much time you want how much
15:50 - time
15:51 - there should be within between each
15:52 - tweet
15:53 - so
15:54 - that's where you specify this value here
15:56 - in seconds so in this case it would be
15:57 - three seconds so that that about does it
16:00 - for how to create the bot and a couple
16:03 - things so moving forward for this uh
16:05 - with you guys if you want to create this
16:07 - go and or if you have created this then
16:10 - the folder that we created to store our
16:12 - images only has about 14 or 15 images i
16:15 - believe i think it's 14 from whatever we
16:17 - scraped so we've got those images but
16:20 - say you wanted to continually um post
16:24 - new content so what you would want to do
16:26 - here is modify the script that scrapes
16:29 - the pictures to continually scrape new
16:32 - pictures or to at a certain time of the
16:34 - day go ahead and request that url again
16:38 - and scrape the new pictures from the web
16:40 - page and add them to that folder so we
16:42 - can continue to iterate over new content
16:45 - and we don't have to continue to say do
16:47 - that by hand we can automate the entire
16:49 - process
16:50 - so that would be how you could move
16:52 - forward with this project and create
16:54 - something that continues to operate
16:57 - hands off
16:58 - so i hope you guys enjoyed this video be
17:00 - sure to give it a thumbs up and
17:02 - subscribe if you guys haven't already
17:04 - any questions or comments definitely
17:05 - leave them below
17:07 - this is a kind of this is a cool project
17:08 - to make and a great project to kind of
17:10 - stretch your python skills it uses a
17:12 - bunch of different libraries and you are
17:15 - using a few different functions to move
17:17 - around your operating system which are
17:19 - interesting to get a look at
17:21 - so yeah i hope you guys enjoy
