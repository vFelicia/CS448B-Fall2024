00:16 - hey everybody sorry for the delay I
00:19 - didn't I need to see that it is started
00:24 - today I have a different camera so it's
00:29 - still a built-in camera but it's on my
00:31 - second day monitors so the angles a
00:33 - little bit different so I'm gonna have
00:35 - to get used to looking over here but
00:37 - it'll probably work out because this is
00:39 - the monitor that I have the code on so
00:41 - I'm normally looking over here anyway so
00:45 - we'll give it a shot and see if this one
00:47 - works better so now you get to see the
00:53 - other side of my office
00:55 - you see there's my whiteboard that I
00:57 - never use and there's my door I can
01:00 - finally see people walking by and today
01:07 - we're gonna work on the footer which is
01:11 - I think I said that yesterday so not too
01:14 - much of a surprise but I want to work on
01:20 - the footer because that's the next part
01:22 - in the in the structure so yesterday we
01:24 - had said we're using materialised
01:26 - framework and that framework you have
01:28 - within your body you have a a header and
01:35 - then as a sibling component a sibling
01:40 - element you have main and then as the
01:43 - final sibling you have footer so we've
01:47 - already done the header we have main
01:51 - there but there's nothing really in it
01:54 - yet at least nothing visible there's
01:56 - some structure so just some add some
01:58 - elements and there's some divs and
02:00 - things and then we have a footer already
02:03 - but it's not it's not implemented the
02:05 - way we want it so I want to get that
02:08 - finished so the footer looks like it's
02:10 - going to look and then we can start like
02:12 - piece by piece adding things and two
02:15 - main all right let me check the live
02:20 - chat just to say hi before we start
02:25 - okay we do have a question about the
02:27 - what is p3 b6 and I'm Barry to answer
02:30 - that but I want to say that just in case
02:31 - there's anybody else wondering about it
02:33 - they can't see the live shot at the end
02:36 - of the titles of the videos I've been
02:37 - putting like for instance today p3 d6
02:41 - that just means project three day six
02:43 - just wanted to make it a little bit
02:45 - shorter so that the title of the video
02:47 - wasn't really long in the description I
02:51 - actually write out the whole thing
02:52 - project three day six so if you see that
02:55 - that's what it means it's just kind of
02:57 - way to keep things organized for
02:58 - everyone let me get this off of the
03:03 - screen this was still for the other
03:05 - project so for project two today I added
03:08 - yesterday I added in analytics with
03:10 - react GA and then today I added in some
03:16 - some click some event tracking to track
03:19 - all of our downloads all the logo
03:21 - downloads and the letterhead downloads
03:23 - so that that'll show up as events in
03:26 - Google Analytics occasionally I need to
03:29 - report the stats on how many people are
03:32 - actually downloading things from that
03:34 - resource center so that the head of my
03:36 - department can go and to people higher
03:40 - up and justify the time spent on on the
03:44 - Resource Center
03:52 - see so let's move I make sure I get my
03:58 - windows I think my windows are still the
04:00 - same as they were to the a so we'll be
04:02 - working in here and you saw our dev
04:07 - tools for that and then here's our
04:11 - here's our cup alright great so let me
04:15 - see I said I was gonna check the live
04:16 - shot and I didn't get very far
04:18 - hey everyone a lot of people saying hi
04:33 - okay so we have a question I'll take
04:36 - this question first and then we'll get
04:38 - started on the code code Chandra says hi
04:43 - Jessie I'm unable to create a footer
04:45 - which will be always placed on the
04:47 - bottom of the page
04:49 - why is it happening so you could let me
04:55 - see there are already some responses so
04:57 - let me see what let's see whatever
05:00 - response getting resized okay it looks
05:08 - like I'm not sure how to pronounce it
05:13 - but it's a okole let me know if that's
05:17 - the wrong pronunciation but okole is
05:20 - gonna send a code snippet so so Shandra
05:24 - let me know if that code snippet doesn't
05:28 - work and maybe I can help
05:31 - or maybe at the end during the question
05:34 - and answer I could try to help a little
05:36 - bit or if you need more help maybe
05:40 - message me on Twitter we're gonna see
05:42 - with the footer today it is always gonna
05:44 - stay on the bottom but I'm gonna use
05:48 - materialized framework and it's gonna do
05:51 - that automatically we could take a look
05:53 - though at the CSS when we do it and then
05:57 - you know maybe you'll get an idea about
05:59 - how they do it and that framework and
06:01 - maybe you can apply that so you know
06:04 - it's is the is the video synced up to my
06:10 - to my face I there's like a slight delay
06:15 - and it's weird and I wonder that is
06:21 - really weird to see that I'm gonna try
06:23 - my best not to look at myself so I'm
06:25 - gonna move this over to the other screen
06:28 - that I don't normally look at because
06:30 - it's freaking me out
06:32 - I'm talking and then afterwards I see my
06:35 - my mouth move Darrow asked if I'm using
06:40 - c-sharp yeah we are using some c-sharp
06:43 - so we'll see what we don't
06:46 - basically we're editing these these
06:48 - templates so we're not really getting in
06:50 - a lot into directly into the c-sharp
06:53 - stuff but occasionally we are gonna edit
06:55 - some some of the c-sharp thing so you
06:58 - can see like you know we have some stuff
07:02 - here that we will be working with but
07:05 - for right now we're gonna go to we're
07:09 - here at the bottom of this main test
07:11 - master let me okay so for some reason
07:25 - Google thought that I was talking to it
07:28 - on my phone I just looked over and I've
07:30 - been having a conversation with the
07:32 - Google assistant inadvertently uh-huh
07:36 - okay so here's our footer section so
07:39 - it's it's not bad we already have it you
07:41 - know as a footer element which is good
07:43 - that's that's what we want for
07:45 - materialized so it's likely that we do
07:50 - have some C where did our main go okay
07:55 - so right now the footer is inside of
07:59 - main so it may be that some of the
08:02 - styles for materialized are getting
08:03 - applied because we have this this footer
08:08 - element but since it's within main I
08:13 - doubt it's it's knowing exactly what
08:15 - it's supposed to do so I'm gonna take
08:16 - this out and I'm gonna take this out as
08:22 - well this comment and then let's put in
08:26 - our footer here and I'm gonna just save
08:32 - that and quickly check before we get
08:36 - started I want to see if that did
08:38 - anything it shouldn't I don't expect it
08:40 - to have any big impact okay great I do
08:45 - want to check to see if any of the
08:48 - materialized styles are already being
08:49 - applied and you know what's if
08:53 - anything's getting overridden let's see
08:57 - so we do have materialized basically
08:59 - the only thing that's supplied now is
09:01 - display:block and then these are some of
09:07 - the custom styles that's making that
09:09 - border
09:17 - okay so far it doesn't look like we have
09:20 - anything anything that is being
09:30 - overridden I think it's your lives the
09:34 - font size the font size may be different
09:41 - trying to find where the original is
09:43 - it's probably up somewhere and I just
09:44 - missed it but it looks it looks pretty
09:49 - good so so far so good hopefully we
09:55 - don't have a lot of conflicts between
09:56 - the styles but not bad we do have some
09:59 - weird stuff going on down here and
10:01 - hopefully this will work itself out as
10:04 - we we take out this content or at least
10:07 - reformat this content with our are
10:12 - calling classes that we're going to use
10:13 - and materialize so I'm not gonna worry
10:17 - about this yet if we reformat everything
10:20 - and we're still having this problem then
10:21 - we'll dig a little bit deeper and try to
10:23 - figure it out okay so right now we have
10:31 - which is actually it's nice that it's
10:33 - commented like this are left call and
10:36 - it'll call them right : but what we need
10:39 - to do is we need to keep these because
10:44 - this the contents being brought in here
10:47 - but we need to remove this article and
10:50 - I'm actually not sure why they chose to
10:52 - use article for that I mean can you all
10:56 - think of any reason why article would be
10:58 - the proper element for for these
11:01 - sections in the footer I don't know that
11:04 - seems it seems a little little odd I
11:09 - just looked at the live chat and john b
11:11 - says without my glasses I don't see
11:14 - sharp so like get it it's because we're
11:18 - doing c-sharp because I thought it was
11:22 - funny
11:26 - okay so let's do that let's get rid of
11:28 - these articles or at least change them
11:30 - oh well I'm yawning already sorry about
11:37 - that
11:44 - okay
11:48 - so I like this is in the section I might
11:52 - actually get rid of the section I don't
11:56 - think we really need a section inside I
11:58 - know that they're doing it they're
12:02 - splitting out that bottom part of the
12:06 - footer but that's not really how I do
12:10 - the the footers with materialised so
12:13 - let's take a look let's take a look at
12:16 - how we're doing the footer here and we
12:20 - can just copy it and bring it over that
12:22 - that'll probably be the easiest way to
12:23 - do it
12:24 - whoa okay I actually don't want I don't
12:34 - want the social media icons in the
12:36 - footer because we have them in the
12:37 - header and that's in that sticky so the
12:42 - user will always have it there we don't
12:44 - need them down there so I'm gonna take
12:45 - that up and that's gonna make things a
12:48 - lot easier
12:49 - well we'll copy it all first and then
12:54 - then we'll take it out
13:01 - all right let's copy that and let's put
13:04 - it below for now and we'll take we don't
13:14 - need we have the copyright for the icons
13:19 - in the top nav already so we don't need
13:23 - that where's our social okay so
13:25 - everything here in our social div will
13:30 - get rid of
13:36 - a-and I was using inline SVG's for that
13:39 - see that's why there's all these these
13:41 - numbers if you haven't used those before
13:43 - I really like them for things like
13:45 - social media icons because you can see
13:46 - that the path for the SVG is not really
13:49 - that long I mean if you there are some
13:52 - SPG's that are like pages long but in
13:56 - this case it's not it's not really a big
13:58 - deal to just pop that in there you don't
14:01 - have to load something else into the
14:03 - page so I like to use them whenever I
14:08 - can
14:08 - alright so you can see now instead of
14:11 - having a section I just have this this
14:15 - class footer copyright container so what
14:19 - we're gonna do for the copyright date I
14:22 - am gonna change it to 2017 but if you
14:25 - remember in our our JavaScript file our
14:29 - custom javascript file that we brought
14:30 - over from our demo site it had a little
14:34 - function in there that kept this up to
14:37 - date so we don't have to worry about
14:39 - bringing that in so I'm gonna leave that
14:40 - there I like this so I'm not gonna worry
14:44 - if we look here about this part I don't
14:49 - think I'm gonna worry about that we
14:52 - might try to bring some of that in but
14:56 - the things that are gonna go down there
14:57 - are not likely to change you know this
15:00 - is is probably never going to change so
15:04 - we do need to worry about you know some
15:07 - of these links but I'm not exactly sure
15:14 - where I want them because these are a
15:16 - lot of links we'll see I haven't decided
15:21 - yet exactly what I want to do with that
15:23 - so for now I'm gonna leave it out to
15:25 - relieve that just as is the universities
15:30 - address and phone number and email it's
15:34 - not likely to change so I'm gonna keep
15:36 - it how I have it because I'm using you
15:39 - know this the schema so I doubt that
15:42 - that's in use right now we can double
15:44 - check it
15:47 - no these are just P tags so I mean it
15:51 - actually they do have it in an address
15:53 - so it's not it's not too bad but we
15:59 - could I guess we could add the slogan if
16:04 - we really want to so for now we're not
16:09 - going to bring in this what is it the
16:13 - left we're not gonna bring that in
16:14 - either but we are gonna bring in these
16:16 - two it's possible that the wording and
16:20 - the links in here would change we are
16:23 - working on a new application so I'm
16:26 - doing the front-end for that in terms of
16:30 - basically just making it look nicer so
16:34 - when that launches we will need to
16:37 - change this link so I'd like this to be
16:39 - changeable from the CMS okay all right
16:46 - so let's pull that in going the wrong
16:50 - way all right I forgot to start my timer
16:53 - again this is two days in a row all
16:55 - right I'm just gonna keep a look let's
16:57 - see what time it is on the floor all
16:59 - right I'm gonna set a 10-minute timer
17:01 - then and I have this let's throw this in
17:06 - here so we can see it when we go to
17:09 - check that okay after the 10 minutes is
17:11 - up then I'll take a five-minute break
17:13 - and I'll answer some questions let's see
17:27 - let's grab this
17:40 - like to see the structure so this is
17:44 - what comes out so we have an H to a P
17:49 - tag and then a class that's about I
17:54 - don't like that I I would really love to
17:57 - find the template for the buttons so
18:00 - that we could just automatically have
18:03 - the materialized style buttons apply we
18:07 - could put in the right classes for now
18:08 - I'm not going to worry about it but I
18:10 - think that would be nice we you know we
18:13 - could always add some classes to our CSS
18:16 - and just use whatever whatever they have
18:21 - here in terms of classes but I think it
18:24 - would be it would be nicer if we could
18:28 - just find this template and then have it
18:30 - apply you know throughout and not not
18:34 - have to you know mess with modifying the
18:38 - classes in materialise okay
18:43 - not really sure I would go with h2s here
18:46 - but we'll just we'll leave it at that
18:48 - for now
18:55 - okay so we're keeping that address
19:05 - see why am i I guess I only had alright
19:12 - I see
19:13 - I had the logo of large size and then
19:16 - the address here okay how are the make
19:21 - sense alright so let's keep
19:33 - maybe we can change this structure a bit
19:52 - let's I get I guess we'll keep this
19:56 - structure for now in terms of just three
20:00 - columns logo and address over here okay
20:09 - so we're gonna change this to and now
20:19 - this logo is not gonna show up
20:21 - immediately I didn't bring this over yet
20:26 - so we're definitely getting an error on
20:31 - this at first or so changes to an M for
20:40 - the column classes and materialise are
20:42 - based on 12 so you can see on small
20:44 - screen so as 12 this means it'll be full
20:47 - width on 12 or on small screens on
20:49 - medium screens and up it will take up
20:52 - four of the twelve columns which means
20:54 - they'll end up being three columns right
20:57 - so 12 divided by 4 is 3 so that's how we
21:00 - handle our columns let's grab this
21:12 - let's try to put this on top of here and
21:17 - just see how how large that becomes and
21:23 - I may have to change this too to match
21:28 - the h2s that are gonna come in I may be
21:33 - able I'm not sure how those h2s are
21:36 - getting in there if there's like a
21:38 - WYSIWYG editor and there's manually been
21:40 - h2s put in there or if it's a template
21:43 - that pulls the title and of that piece
21:48 - of content and puts it in h2 so we may
21:51 - be able to change that and just make
21:53 - them all h5 we'll see all right so now
21:59 - that that's out I'm gonna take this and
22:04 - all within the same row this is not
22:08 - giving me the corresponding div I don't
22:13 - like all right okay so let's put two
22:18 - more columns there and now we can take
22:24 - our content
22:32 - so use this content and put this in here
22:39 - and we'll take a right column content
22:45 - and put it in here in our last call on
22:52 - and I want to completely get rid of
22:55 - everything in this footer actually I
23:04 - want to see
23:12 - I can't want to see what's in there
23:14 - right now so let's let's put this in
23:18 - here it's gonna look really weird at
23:20 - first but I just want to see how it how
23:24 - it comes out I see what we can do with
23:28 - it save that and then let's let's check
23:35 - it out there we go
23:40 - I'm gonna keep an eye on that timer whoa
23:45 - okay
23:47 - so it's looking for this content block
23:49 - this footer Left content block that we
23:52 - got rid of so let's go into that c-sharp
23:55 - file and see if see if it's in there
23:59 - yeah footer left okay
24:04 - let's get rid of that so we'll just
24:06 - comment it out for now and see if that
24:08 - fixes it
24:14 - mmm
24:19 - okay not yet
24:40 - there we go
24:43 - that should be it I don't think it's
24:45 - referenced anywhere else
24:54 - all right
25:02 - whoa-ha-ha very different okay so this
25:06 - is the default color
25:07 - I wonder what size image I'm loading in
25:09 - there that keeps taking quite a while
25:11 - off to double-check on that okay so
25:20 - definitely need some need some work
25:22 - right we don't want the shadows here or
25:26 - this font so definitely don't want this
25:32 - color these buttons don't aren't how we
25:36 - want then let's check out down here down
25:46 - here we didn't have any of the any of
25:50 - these other links that I thought we
25:55 - would get you can see here we're getting
26:03 - all of this but that did not show up
26:08 - let's see
26:19 - interesting okay well that explains why
26:22 - it was getting styled differently before
26:24 - is that it's inside of an Ave okay still
26:35 - not sure why it's not
26:52 - okay so the timer's probably almost you
26:57 - can see things are looking a little bit
26:59 - weird right now
26:59 - we'll just have to fix up the Styles a
27:01 - bit and figure out what where those
27:04 - links were coming in at the ones way at
27:07 - the bottom of the footer and see if we
27:10 - can get them back preferably in a format
27:13 - that's not in a nav I'm gonna take a
27:17 - five minute break to answer questions
27:20 - check out the live chat and then we'll
27:22 - do another Pomodoro session we do at
27:26 - least one more session and then we'll
27:28 - see what time it is
27:29 - if yeah we'll do one more session for
27:34 - sure and we'll just see how it's going I
27:37 - kind of think what we can get this to
27:41 - the point where it looks pretty good
27:42 - with one more
28:04 - okay a spar spar willsez so that's a
28:09 - copy and paste SVG yes yeah for sure
28:16 - yeah you just copy it
28:18 - the SVG's put them right in there in
28:20 - that case for those social media icons I
28:24 - got them from someone's code pen which I
28:28 - did a tribute where I got them that it's
28:32 - not in this file it's in the other file
28:33 - so I have the big they had a big thing
28:36 - in their code pen saying if you use
28:37 - these icons make sure you include this
28:40 - you know in your in your code so I did
28:42 - andreas Larsen and I think thank you
28:48 - that's who did it so anyway they're
28:49 - really nice very small SVG's for other
28:53 - icons for my material icons I just go to
28:55 - the material icon website look up the
28:58 - one I want and then you can get them
29:00 - either as a ping or an SVG or a font
29:04 - icon and I just grabbed the SVG it's a
29:08 - it's a similar thing really small SVG
29:11 - snippet you just put them right in the
29:13 - project
29:22 - all right Blake Thomas says does anybody
29:26 - here know PHP I know a little bit of PHP
29:33 - so I'm not really sure if you have a
29:36 - question about it about something
29:40 - specific in PHP you could let me know
29:42 - I'll do my best but I'm not really
29:45 - confident that I could give you a great
29:46 - answer because I don't use PHP
29:49 - frequently how Rowan says was busy last
29:54 - week looks like things have changed says
29:57 - whoa vs code live cam view asp.net yeah
30:02 - it's very deep if you've been gone for
30:05 - two weeks things have changed so to two
30:07 - weeks ago we were using atom and react
30:11 - and we had no live live video so I know
30:22 - they're gone so we had no live video of
30:24 - my face definitely a little bit
30:27 - different now
30:31 - hopefully the next project is back to
30:33 - react I'd like to get back to react this
30:36 - is cool it's kind of fun to do something
30:37 - different but I don't know that this is
30:40 - really expanding my my skills and in a
30:45 - way that is the most efficient way to
30:49 - get better you know trying to learn some
30:52 - legacy stuff that I don't know yeah the
30:56 - odds of me having to use this even at
30:58 - this job in the future a really small
31:01 - let alone at another job but a lot of
31:07 - the basic stuff like the HTML CSS that's
31:10 - the same everywhere so it's not like I'm
31:12 - not you're practicing my skills at all
31:26 - cool John Hansen says SVG SVG Oh on
31:33 - github is a great node tool that will
31:35 - make an SVG SVG files small enough to
31:39 - paste in line awesome
31:56 - I'm just looking for questions here
32:04 - okay so blank who asked about PHP
32:07 - earlier says I'm trying to set up a
32:10 - wordpress website for a nonprofit but
32:12 - the WP style guide slash template they
32:15 - have has an error I can't figure it out
32:19 - okay okay so it looks like John B's
32:27 - gonna work on that error let us know
32:31 - okay it looks it looks like Blake just
32:39 - pulled it up the website and now it
32:40 - works so it didn't work this morning and
32:42 - not work so that's cool when that
32:44 - happens I mean you always wish you knew
32:46 - what the problem was but if it works and
32:48 - it keeps working then that's that's
32:50 - awesome okay so I got to the bottom of
32:56 - the live chat and the timer just went
32:58 - off so let's start this up again let's
33:03 - see if we can get this footer finished
33:05 - and one more Pomodoro session
33:14 - alright first things first I want to
33:18 - find out where these links are the
33:19 - styling stuff is gonna be no problem the
33:23 - links I'm not really sure what's going
33:26 - on with that so let's tackle that one
33:28 - first so I think I'll bring up so this
33:32 - is our main test master I'm going to
33:34 - bring up the normal main dot master and
33:39 - go down to the footer since we took out
33:47 - a lot of stuff from the footer I want to
33:49 - see how it was initially oh I see now it
33:56 - looks like did we have it looks like we
34:04 - had multiple things here in this this
34:10 - copyright section and I did not grab
34:13 - them I just took them all out so which
34:17 - one did I grab let's see
34:23 - I grabbed this one and I don't think
34:27 - this has anything we need so I'm gonna
34:29 - take that out and instead I'm gonna
34:34 - bring in alright we don't need the
34:37 - social icons this looks like what we
34:40 - need this footer menu so like I said
34:43 - already I don't like that this is a nav
34:47 - we'll see what it looks like I don't
34:49 - think it's gonna look good we may just
34:52 - have to hard code those links in and if
34:57 - they need changed I'll just have to do
34:59 - it I don't think that's really a big
35:01 - deal those links if they're changed at
35:03 - all it's once a year I'm fine with
35:07 - taking five minutes once a year to come
35:09 - in here and change that
35:22 - oh my god
35:25 - all right so let's see hey Kix I expect
35:30 - this to look terrible
35:33 - whoa okay I took out the footer
35:40 - copyright so that's why we're getting
35:44 - that error again let's take this outside
35:48 - accidentally edit it because that's that
35:50 - was the live site so let's take out this
35:54 - footer copyright and I'm just gonna
35:58 - remove it up here
36:07 - yeah we should be good
36:15 - okay All Right see ya we're getting
36:18 - we're getting this in here we're also
36:22 - getting no we're getting that did I
36:29 - leave something in that I should not
36:30 - have maybe I need to put in the the HTML
36:38 - code for copyright
36:47 - so I'm looking that up on looking that
36:55 - up on my other screen it's actually
37:00 - really really nice it came up right in
37:03 - Google search I don't even have to click
37:04 - anything it was just right at the top so
37:09 - let's make sure that that was the
37:11 - problem and that it fixed it yep that
37:16 - fixed it okay cool so we have the
37:18 - correct copyright symbol now we have
37:20 - these I guess we have two options option
37:29 - one is we just add in some really
37:33 - specific styles to make this look how we
37:37 - want it to look option two we hard-code
37:43 - them let's just check out what's going
37:49 - on with the styles quickly in dev tools
37:51 - see how hard it would be
37:53 - I think the fastest thing at this point
37:56 - would be to hard-code them but we'll
38:00 - need our nav let's take out some of the
38:01 - stuff from the nav it's gonna mess up
38:04 - our top nav briefly but
38:33 - okay
38:47 - yeah I guess we could take all that out
39:02 - now I'm just I'm gonna hard coat it
39:06 - they said it's only for links you know
39:09 - directions won't change privacy policy
39:13 - probably won't change contact us won't
39:15 - change the non-discrimination statement
39:17 - I don't the privacy policy and
39:20 - non-discrimination statement are the
39:21 - only things that might change I'm not
39:24 - really sure if these have to change here
39:26 - to here or not so let's see how we want
39:29 - to do this probably I think what I'd
39:37 - like to do is have the copyright on this
39:40 - side and then have the links over here
39:42 - at the bottom then when the screen gets
39:48 - smaller we may we just maybe stack them
39:54 - on small screens yeah yeah we'll stack
40:01 - them
40:07 - yeah it's really think I will do this
40:10 - I'd rather have the links on top let's
40:17 - see here so here so I want to do this
40:19 - we're gonna take this out and we'll add
40:28 - inside this container we're gonna put
40:31 - this inside I'm gonna make a row did
40:40 - first then class and then row so this is
40:45 - this is how you set things up and
40:47 - materialize and I really need to get
40:53 - some plugins here for Visual Studio code
40:59 - how's it look used to Adam just like
41:02 - automatically writing most of my code
41:04 - for me then we need two columns
41:14 - it's going to be s12 m6
41:36 - so two columns
41:46 - let's take this and we'll put that in
41:48 - the first column and then within our
41:53 - second column we're going to need we'll
41:58 - just do a ul that'd be the best way yeah
42:02 - we'll do a ul
42:16 - and we had four lengths only for allies
42:38 - okay so for now I'm just gonna put the
42:43 - names I don't remember what they were
42:46 - contact us privacy policy directions
42:50 - I mean it's moving it
43:18 - okay
43:21 - now let's say that see what it looks
43:24 - like
43:24 - definitely gonna have you know work on
43:26 - this this ul but at least we'll get an
43:30 - idea of what what we have oops
43:34 - I'm gonna do it over to the other screen
43:44 - okay
43:49 - all right so we want want
44:38 - that's our
44:53 - okay I didn't realize this until now so
44:56 - Rho is some you know we get that class
45:00 - with materialized but it looks like the
45:02 - site had already had some styles that
45:05 - were on row here so was giving it a
45:07 - width of 100% and a max width of 960
45:15 - pixels so I do not want that you see
45:18 - that was our problem here so this is
45:21 - closer to what we're gonna want and so
45:27 - you don't really need that let's let's
45:32 - make sure we we override these in our
45:36 - and a new new design so let's just
45:46 - I guess we can set with two Auto and Max
45:52 - with we do max with none is that valid
45:58 - yeah it looks like that works
46:00 - okay so let's find that now and make
46:03 - those changes so Jess
46:17 - and up here for right now we don't I'm
46:22 - not very organized
46:33 - all right see you just want to try to
46:35 - cancel out what was already being done
46:47 - let's refresh
46:54 - oops let's see what we have going on
46:57 - with a row
47:08 - okay great so that's their awesome
47:17 - so now we can we can put our our styles
47:20 - here
47:28 - we already have some footer styles down
47:30 - here so let's just put it put it down
47:35 - here with that
47:58 - what do we have this in footer I guess
48:06 - we don't I want to be really specific so
48:08 - let's go I want to be specific just in
48:18 - case we put we ever put a list up in
48:20 - that top portion of the footer I want it
48:23 - I don't want to have to worry about that
48:25 - list being horizontal instead of
48:27 - vertical which is what you would
48:28 - normally think when you did a list so
48:31 - that's why I want to be specific and
48:32 - make sure this is in footer
48:34 - copyright so what do we have we just put
48:38 - a float on it for now float and I think
48:44 - I had said float left but I think we
48:50 - should float it right
49:03 - okay all right great
49:06 - actually this is in a different order
49:11 - that
49:22 - okay
49:24 - if I float it left we do get it in the
49:27 - right order at least
49:36 - let's see how that looks
49:43 - all right let's see what right looks
49:46 - like again
49:54 - I don't know that I could even sell the
49:56 - difference
50:06 - oh yeah it looks like it really would
50:10 - have only moved slightly over one way to
50:14 - the other so if we had it to the right
50:16 - or to the left so I think it doesn't
50:27 - matter here if it would have been a more
50:28 - significant shift over to the right I
50:31 - would have floated right and then just
50:34 - changed the order so it ended up being
50:36 - in the right order but for now I think
50:38 - left will be fine and that will save us
50:47 - from having to change the order and
50:49 - right we don't really have see that much
50:54 - of a shift you can see here you know it
50:58 - really hasn't shifted too much just a
51:01 - few pick I mean that's maybe 10 pixels
51:03 - of a difference okay we didn't need to
51:07 - add some padding here so let's add
51:11 - padding will add the padding to the left
51:15 - and that'll that'll help at least not
51:20 - shift it even more over than we needed
51:23 - to otherwise I probably would have added
51:27 - it right whoops
51:34 - we go eight pixels and mm-hm
51:47 - let's see how this look we definitely
51:49 - need this to be white there we go
51:55 - now we can see it better all right
52:12 - I'd like that maybe a little bit more
52:13 - space in here but I'm not I think it's
52:20 - fine all right for these links at the
52:22 - footer that most people will never even
52:24 - see I don't think it's I don't think
52:31 - it's expected to have you know a lot of
52:34 - space around here so but looks okay for
52:39 - now I didn't like the fact that you know
52:43 - very early on it goes down like this so
52:46 - what I think I may do and I want to
52:49 - double-check this now
52:57 - what I think I may do is change the
53:01 - column widths so that this has more
53:05 - space so let's do that now and let's
53:17 - make this let's see how wide we can get
53:24 - away with so let's make that a nine
53:25 - we'll make this a three this might be
53:28 - too much but we'll give it a shot
53:40 - yeah yeah I think that's too much as you
53:46 - could see with you know automatically
53:47 - this goes on to two lines all right so
53:50 - let's go for should be fine then we also
53:57 - want to make sure that we we put in the
54:00 - rest of that CSS that we had just put in
54:02 - here so we need a color and then padding
54:09 - left at 10 pixels
54:21 - okay I want to check my timer all right
54:25 - just under four minutes and whoops and I
54:31 - never changed this back this needs to be
54:35 - left
54:42 - oh that actually that that's interesting
54:46 - so since I changed the column classes
54:48 - this actually is a much larger shift so
54:50 - we may have to end up going back to our
54:52 - padding right or our float right but
54:57 - what this does give us is that you know
55:02 - we can come to a much smaller size
55:05 - without having these wrap you know I
55:11 - don't we're not gonna be able to have it
55:13 - so that you know either one rats unless
55:15 - we go you know that's we stack them
55:18 - really early on as you can see the other
55:23 - alternative to is right now these are in
55:25 - a container we could potentially expand
55:30 - this out and give them the full width of
55:32 - the page normally I don't like to do
55:36 - that I think it looks nicer if we keep
55:38 - that in line here but in this case we
55:40 - have a lot to go in here so that's
55:42 - that's also an option
55:53 - you see
55:56 - see what we can do in two minutes here
56:04 - let's at least get
56:12 - let's get this this background the right
56:15 - color at the very least I want to see
56:20 - what div that is applied to okay the
56:26 - page page footer okay so it's on the
56:29 - footer so
56:40 - and put it right here this should work
56:49 - background color you know to 1/4 1/2 a
56:56 - that's the green color
57:03 - okay definitely don't want this text to
57:08 - be black and we want to change these
57:12 - fonts
57:26 - and you know we would normally have the
57:30 - logo here as well so this contact would
57:33 - be down a bit farther and then we'd have
57:35 - the logo and this now that I look at
57:44 - this it might make more sense to flip
57:48 - this around a bit this section looks
57:52 - shorter than this section we'll have to
57:59 - see I guess that's not really important
58:01 - right now you know this could
58:02 - potentially change also I don't think I
58:08 - want this centered like I'd rather have
58:12 - it aligned differently so just some
58:15 - little things for the most part
58:16 - everything's working fine now with this
58:19 - footer we're pulling in this data here
58:21 - from the CMS and this data here as well
58:27 - we've hard-coded this and it just needs
58:31 - a bit of adjustment we do need to make
58:33 - some decisions about how these what we
58:38 - want to do whether or not we want them
58:40 - to wrap onto another line or whether we
58:41 - just want to have them stack you know
58:47 - kind of early on I don't know I don't
58:51 - like to have a really tall copyright
58:54 - area here but in this case in this case
58:59 - we might it might actually look better
59:01 - to just stack them right off the bat you
59:04 - know we got a lot going on here and then
59:06 - then we'd be able to give this a little
59:07 - bit more space yeah maybe I'll do that
59:12 - so I've got some decisions to make on
59:14 - this and maybe we'll make them together
59:17 - tomorrow we'll see how far I get between
59:21 - now and then okay so my timer went off
59:24 - and I think - Thomas yeah I think I'm
59:29 - going to do questions now and
59:34 - and then we'll finish up after questions
59:36 - so if anybody is not interested in
59:40 - sticking around for the questions thank
59:42 - you for watching and please join us
59:45 - again sometime if you can't stick around
59:47 - that would be awesome if you have a
59:49 - question please put it in the live chat
59:51 - now and even if you don't have a
59:53 - question please stick around if you can
59:55 - and hope to answer some of these
59:56 - questions alright so I'm gonna try to
59:59 - scroll up and find where I left off and
60:02 - I'm just gonna keep going down from
60:05 - there and I'll get to I'll get to all
60:10 - the questions today definitely have time
60:12 - for that
60:32 - okay I think I found it here
60:38 - oh okay so John B says if you type in
60:42 - dot row Visual Studio code will
60:45 - automatically make it a div for you by
60:47 - default the s code has Emmet installed
60:50 - by default oh I did not know that that's
60:52 - really cool also can do the same for ID
60:56 - I want to try that out right now and
60:58 - that'll help me remember it better as
61:01 - well but let's let's try it out so and
61:06 - then oh that's so cool
61:14 - John B that's the that's the tip of the
61:20 - day okay so if if you use Visual Studio
61:25 - code try that out I'm trying to think
61:28 - what else you can do with Emmet can't
61:30 - you do stuff like with L eyes oh yes you
61:33 - can
61:33 - oh man let's try this you know that
61:39 - didn't work how do you do the u.s. shoot
61:42 - I thought there was some way that you
61:44 - could just do you could do it like a
61:50 - string but anyway that's really cool
61:52 - and then with the ID - so cool now that
62:03 - now I'm just playing around here let's
62:05 - see if I can do okay let's try this
62:12 - again
62:16 - in the house very nice
62:25 - that's really cool thank you thank you
62:28 - for that that's that's awesome now I'm
62:30 - gonna have to look I haven't done
62:33 - anything with Emmet I remember I did
62:35 - some tutorials with it a long time ago
62:37 - like the years ago and I don't remember
62:41 - much now I'm gonna have to check it out
62:44 - again
62:52 - okay John B says waited that's where
62:54 - HTML files may not work for master well
62:56 - actually so this isn't really an HTML
62:58 - file but I set it to treat it like an
63:02 - HTML file so I think that's why it ends
63:05 - up working
63:15 - okay and he mentioned you have to press
63:17 - tab right so when I was doing that I
63:19 - pressed tab when I was done typing and
63:21 - that's then it then it did that John
63:31 - Hanson said don't bring that footer up
63:32 - on the screen too often the colors are
63:34 - burning my eyes yeah that was pretty bad
63:37 - for her little Wow
63:50 - okay rowan says there's an asp net
63:53 - helper package cool I will have to try
63:58 - that
64:06 - oh is lint I'm not sure I pronounces so
64:11 - this means I don't know I'm really sorry
64:17 - zi z Li and I and the za
64:23 - so sorry I was having trouble
64:25 - pronouncing that but anyway says to use
64:30 - flexbox instead of floats john hanson
64:33 - commented that flexbox won't do much
64:36 - here since there's a column framework
64:38 - set up yeah so the column framework
64:42 - would do what we wanted here pretty much
64:46 - otherwise I probably would try to use
64:48 - flexbox in particular I would it would
64:51 - be cool to use being able to reorder
64:55 - things on different screen sizes would
64:57 - be good because I want right I want the
65:01 - copyright to be on the left in the menu
65:06 - to be on the right but then on a small
65:08 - screen size I want him to flip positions
65:11 - so that the copyright goes on the bottom
65:13 - right in the second place which normally
65:15 - is in the first so you can do that
65:16 - easily with flexbox anyway we'll see I'm
65:22 - undecided exactly how I'm going to do
65:25 - that
65:33 - nobody says thanks for the streaming
65:36 - you're welcome I appreciate you saying
65:40 - that okay Shay says any specific design
65:47 - inspiration for this project beyond the
65:49 - university style guides style guidelines
65:56 - no I don't really have I mean it's gonna
66:01 - be just basically along the style
66:03 - guidelines but uh so I'll talk a little
66:05 - bit about kind of what I'm going for
66:09 - I would like it to be for this middle
66:14 - section to have large full width
66:17 - sections of of content
66:20 - I mean pizza there's gonna be some space
66:23 - on the sides on on really large screens
66:25 - you know obviously but right now you can
66:30 - see it has kind of this split nice
66:35 - there's all these sections and it split
66:37 - up into three columns excuse me I just
66:45 - can't quit yawning sorry to everyone if
66:48 - I'm making you yawn out there I know
66:49 - it's contagious but we have this
66:53 - occasionally it's broken up by things
66:54 - like this but I want to get rid of all
67:00 - that and just have you know sections no
67:04 - no big columns like this so within one
67:07 - section maybe I'll have some columns
67:10 - depending on if the content makes sense
67:13 - to be in columns but I would I would
67:19 - rather have kind of a progression of
67:21 - ideas you know some web pages it's
67:24 - almost like it tells a story about
67:25 - something as you scroll down right now I
67:29 - just don't feel that we're we're telling
67:31 - a story I think that these you know the
67:35 - sections are in here and could be
67:38 - flipped around you know the about could
67:40 - definitely be elsewhere right academics
67:42 - admissions I mean these
67:46 - these don't have to be in this order
67:48 - they could be flipped around I think and
67:50 - still be be fine these could be in any
67:53 - order so I'd like to try to have it in
67:56 - some you know more of an order you know
68:00 - right here it's gonna probably say apply
68:02 - and then we have donate here so if
68:04 - somebody who knows what they want to do
68:05 - already they're gonna be able to do it
68:06 - but otherwise once they scroll we're
68:08 - gonna tell them the story about the
68:10 - University and once they get to the
68:12 - bottom then we can give them another
68:14 - call to action to either apply or donate
68:17 - or learn more but I want it to be less
68:24 - words and more targeted more intentional
68:27 - about what we want users to know right
68:31 - now there's just so much going on here
68:33 - if someone just came here for the first
68:35 - time and knew almost nothing about the
68:37 - University I think it would just be an
68:40 - overload of you know what what's this
68:43 - you know what is it really about on this
68:47 - page it just seems like there's just so
68:50 - much so much information it's hard to
68:53 - pick out what the most important
68:54 - information is so that's kind of my you
68:58 - know beyond just the basic design that's
69:00 - that's my inspiration for just kind of
69:02 - the flow I wonder if this might be I
69:06 - guess somewhat of a good visual example
69:09 - I don't know I think I've shown this
69:15 - before but this is a sight I did last
69:19 - year at some point it has it's it's a
69:22 - little bit different right it's not
69:25 - it hasn't some of the same elements to
69:27 - it but this is a like a building
69:31 - development that the University is doing
69:33 - so that it's gonna have a hotel with
69:35 - restaurants and things so thanks for the
69:37 - students to do things for visitors to
69:38 - the University to be able to stay there
69:40 - you know close to the school but in in
69:47 - this it's there's way less text right a
69:51 - lot less text it's clear for each
69:54 - section what you can do
69:59 - this is kind of what I'm going for
70:02 - something more clean it's not gonna be
70:03 - like this where we just switch back and
70:05 - forth there is actually not really a lot
70:08 - of content when I made this the the
70:10 - hotel wasn't even open yet and there
70:13 - were no restaurants there so there
70:15 - wasn't a lot going on so like we don't
70:18 - even have a tab for dining right now it
70:20 - was built but we didn't have any
70:22 - restaurants yet so I'll add that in we
70:26 - may be actually working on this project
70:27 - at some point to update it the
70:30 - restaurant the first restaurants are
70:32 - supposed to open in October but you know
70:35 - for instance like the hotel page kind of
70:38 - a similar thing you can book right away
70:40 - you know or we can tell you what you
70:44 - want to see so obviously we want to sell
70:47 - the Suites right and it's not it the
70:49 - hotel's run by another company in the
70:51 - university doesn't directly run it but
70:52 - we want to showcase the Suites right off
70:54 - the bat right they're the most expensive
70:56 - thing we want to sell that then we drop
71:00 - down to the rooms and at that point we
71:03 - say hey do you want to you want to book
71:04 - online now right so you give another
71:06 - chance
71:07 - and then we show you know even more
71:09 - stuff so that's kind of the flow that
71:13 - I'm going for just kind of like a a more
71:18 - thought-out approach to if somebody's
71:22 - coming here what do we want to tell them
71:25 - and what order do we want to tell them
71:26 - and then what actions do we want it to
71:29 - be very easy for them to take you know
71:30 - what information should be really easy
71:32 - for them to get to so anyway I know I
71:37 - went on a lot for that but that's kind
71:41 - of my my goal for this site now I don't
71:45 - have full reign over this site you know
71:48 - being the main site for the university
71:49 - obviously there's a lot of people that
71:51 - want to have a say and what goes on here
71:54 - so I'm gonna try my best and inflate as
71:58 - much as I can to try to just strip as
72:00 - much content out of that homepage as I
72:02 - possibly can I don't care if interior
72:05 - pages are loaded with content if
72:06 - somebody clicks to learn more I'll give
72:08 - them pages of content right because
72:11 - they've already
72:11 - the desire they want to learn more so
72:13 - I'll give them what they want to give
72:14 - you know a ton of text content but on
72:17 - the homepage I don't want to flood it
72:19 - with content you know to everything so
72:22 - we'll see how much I can I can do here
72:28 - [Music]
72:29 - we'll see I actually just had a meeting
72:32 - with my boss
72:32 - earlier it was kind of just not really
72:38 - planned but I showed him what was going
72:40 - on so far and he shared with me his
72:42 - vision for the complete redesign when we
72:44 - completely redo the site you know
72:46 - hopefully sometime you know next year or
72:48 - so and it's gonna be very very different
72:52 - so that's going to be cool I guess just
72:56 - to give you a small heads up it's gonna
72:58 - be it's gonna look almost more like a
73:01 - social media platform than a university
73:04 - like website users gonna have a lot of
73:08 - control over what content they see right
73:10 - off the bat which i think is always good
73:13 - it's gonna be a lot of base based on
73:16 - cards and being able to sift through
73:19 - category content having a really good
73:23 - search function so it's going to be very
73:27 - different I'm excited about it it's
73:29 - definitely going to be react the CMS
73:31 - will maybe be WordPress unless I can
73:33 - find something else that I like better
73:36 - and we'll pull it in through the API I'd
73:40 - actually really much rather have a graph
73:42 - QL instead of just a regular REST API
73:45 - but anyway it'll be really different so
73:50 - that's the cool project that be looking
73:52 - forward to and if if Quincy from you
73:56 - know free cook camp wants me to still
73:59 - stream at that point when I'm doing this
74:01 - project then I'll definitely be
74:02 - streaming it otherwise if I get kicked
74:05 - off of this channel which I have no
74:07 - reason to believe that I would but just
74:09 - in case I think I can always stream it
74:11 - on my own channel because that'll be a
74:14 - really cool project alright let me get
74:17 - an X next question
74:24 - anyway that was a cool question
74:26 - Shay thanks thanks for asking that I it
74:36 - was kind of wide open
74:37 - it allowed me to talk a lot but I have
74:42 - thought quite a bit about what I do with
74:44 - this site I had the chance
74:46 - okay cool so alright check this out I'm
74:51 - getting some stuff in the live chat
74:53 - about how to use Emmet and let's see
75:13 - oops
75:17 - dang it I messed it up Wow check that
75:24 - out that's awesome so it's just made a
75:27 - ul with five allies and then nested
75:30 - inside are a tags with the href very
75:34 - cool very cool so I think basically if
75:38 - you if you do this
75:41 - whoops then you can you can nest things
75:45 - so it's this symbol that's the one is
75:48 - that the greater than symbol does it
75:50 - that's really cool wrong it says it's
75:55 - like a baby getting a new to it yeah for
75:57 - sure
75:58 - I'm really excited enough Oh
76:04 - shaeeah says someone made a simple
76:05 - Emmett cheat sheet
76:07 - it's got somebody had to it mate it's
76:09 - got to be out there somewhere
76:13 - and John Hanson said if you use pug it's
76:16 - even easier than those HTML shortcuts
76:21 - yeah I haven't you well I use try think
76:28 - well last time I use I did attempt to
76:30 - use pod but at one point back in the day
76:36 - it might have still been called Jade at
76:39 - that point so if you're familiar with
76:41 - Jade templates plug it plug is Jade they
76:44 - they just had to change their name
76:46 - because some company owns the rights to
76:49 - use the word Jade as their company name
76:52 - so so they had to change the pug
76:59 - okay so these so I'm gonna say Zn 4zo I
77:08 - and IND za since I can't figure out how
77:11 - to pronounce that so zns can you explain
77:15 - the master thing alright so these files
77:24 - that's that r dot master I think now
77:28 - correct me if I'm wrong for you all that
77:31 - they know more about this I think these
77:35 - are like the the asp.net template files
77:42 - so yes let's see but they are this is
77:53 - like the top level so anything that's
77:55 - dot master is like this is the top level
77:57 - so you can see it has you know the HTML
77:59 - tag right so everything else all these
78:02 - other template files these dot aspx
78:04 - templates they all feed into this one
78:09 - right so there are actually several
78:11 - masters but a page can only have one
78:14 - master file so that's this the top level
78:16 - little template that would be like the
78:19 - index dot JSP is or something we get
78:31 - that would be the page write that in
78:35 - your page component so that's that's
78:42 - what master that dot master means in
78:44 - this context I have no idea if that's
78:47 - just specific to this content management
78:49 - system the Ektron CMS or if that's
78:53 - something that is in all asp.net things
78:57 - i don't know enough about it to know
79:00 - whether or not that's the case but
79:02 - that's basically what the dot master
79:05 - means as far as I know
79:13 - Theo says I can't quite understand what
79:16 - you use a CMS system for in which
79:19 - situations is it necessary to take
79:21 - advantage of one is having a database
79:23 - with the REST API not enough or is it a
79:25 - totally different thing okay so when I
79:34 - if I'm developing a small website where
79:39 - I'm going to be the only one editing it
79:41 - I don't bother with a CMS I usually only
79:45 - even bought it with with a database if I
79:47 - don't need one I just edit you know the
79:49 - the HTML directly if someone else needs
79:56 - to edit it I almost always use a CMS of
80:03 - some sort
80:04 - usually WordPress because it's it's
80:06 - pretty user friendly there's a lot of
80:09 - documentation and tutorials out there
80:11 - for people learn how to use it because I
80:17 - can't always be the person that changes
80:20 - things my day would just be filled up
80:22 - with changing things on all the
80:24 - different websites that we have or it's
80:26 - if it's for a client and it's just a
80:28 - contract thing and then I won't really
80:30 - see or talk to them ever again they need
80:32 - to be able to edit it on their own so
80:34 - that's why I like a CMS because it
80:35 - allows them to go in and with the
80:37 - WYSIWYG editor just kind of be able to
80:42 - have some control over the content on
80:44 - their website now if there are
80:51 - situations where website would be bigger
80:52 - and I might still be the person that's
80:57 - going to be doing most of the editing or
80:58 - other people who maybe know a little bit
81:01 - more who don't need the WYSIWYG editor
81:04 - at that point potentially I would want
81:07 - to maybe just do a database with the
81:09 - REST API or graph QL or something and
81:12 - not bother about a full-on
81:15 - CMS maybe just something really
81:17 - lightweight maybe even something and
81:20 - just make you know make myself
81:22 - so that's kind of it just really depends
81:24 - on who is going to be doing the updating
81:27 - of the content and what is their skill
81:29 - level that's how I determine whether or
81:33 - not I need a CMS
81:49 - okay so no beer is giving me some help
81:52 - in pronouncing ice let me try this
81:55 - Zillah ninda nimza some saline ins I
82:01 - feel so silly
82:03 - alright I'll work on it
82:19 - okay John B says on the point of the
82:22 - colors for the footer like the greens
82:24 - and such why not save them into CSS
82:26 - variables instead of constantly
82:28 - remembering the hex values you define
82:30 - the variables in root then define the
82:34 - colors with two dashes so main color you
82:39 - want to call it okay yeah actually I
82:42 - haven't used the the CSS variable is yet
82:47 - what's the support for those can I use
82:52 - them in a in a browser yet so I don't
82:56 - know if I can then I'll learn how to use
82:58 - them normally I use sass and I do say
83:03 - things as sass variables in this case I
83:09 - I have that green hex color memorized so
83:12 - I almost always just type it in because
83:14 - I'm I remember it because I've used it
83:17 - so often with the other colors though it
83:20 - would be helpful to just have them saved
83:22 - in variables so assuming that I can use
83:25 - the CSS variables and it if it has good
83:29 - browser coverage then all you know I'll
83:31 - use them
83:49 - okay cool so che che says this is a
83:52 - follow up when che asked earlier about
83:54 - my plan for the website so here's a
83:55 - follow up to that
83:57 - Shay says I like the website plan is the
84:00 - site more for potential students or
84:02 - maybe alumni rather than current
84:04 - students or are you thinking that they
84:06 - will know to use the menu to navigate to
84:09 - a student page yeah okay so this is the
84:12 - really tricky thing the so I mentioned
84:16 - several times before that I was not
84:18 - working here when the current website
84:21 - was designed and developed but I have
84:25 - heard a lot about the process and one of
84:27 - the things that happen in the process
84:29 - which it makes sense that this would
84:31 - happen is that everybody wanted in on
84:35 - the website so like the people from
84:37 - student life wanted a lot of things on
84:40 - the websites for current students right
84:43 - certainly the people who are in charge
84:45 - of getting donations wanted a lot of
84:48 - stuff on there geared towards donors
84:51 - people in admissions wanted a lot of
84:54 - things on there geared towards potential
84:55 - students and we have other things too
84:57 - like we put on a lot of conferences for
84:59 - adults and for youth certainly
85:02 - conferences one of their stuff on there
85:04 - and we have like pilgrimages that we
85:08 - sponsors so people go like you know like
85:11 - to the holy land or to Rome or something
85:13 - like that
85:13 - you know different places and we help
85:16 - organize those trips they certainly want
85:19 - so everybody wanted something on there
85:21 - that's why the current site has so much
85:24 - on there right every department within
85:28 - you know that the academic side of
85:30 - things every department wanted to be on
85:32 - there so that was really difficult
85:35 - so what since I since I've got here I've
85:38 - frequently brought up you know as often
85:41 - as I can in meetings that we need to
85:44 - focus on like what is our target
85:46 - audience I realize we're gonna have a
85:48 - lot of different people coming to the
85:49 - site but what do we really want to focus
85:51 - on and I think we've narrowed it down to
85:55 - prospective students as our number one
85:58 - focus and then as our number two focus
86:01 - close close behind
86:03 - our donors everything else is is
86:08 - secondary right so we want to still
86:11 - provide information about all the other
86:13 - stuff but that's gonna be secondary so
86:16 - that's going to be the main focus of the
86:18 - site so that's why it's it's somewhat
86:20 - reflected already and I didn't put it in
86:22 - here but I think I mentioned earlier
86:24 - this is going to say apply and this is
86:27 - donate so wait so what happens the main
86:29 - call-to-action apply and then up here we
86:33 - have the donate button and then down
86:36 - farther in the page maybe at the bottom
86:38 - maybe somewhere in the middle we'll
86:40 - probably have another at least one other
86:42 - spot where students can apply or fill
86:46 - out maybe an inquiry form and let us
86:48 - know that they're they're thinking about
86:49 - coming to school here and then you know
86:53 - throughout we can mention other things
86:55 - as it comes in I'm you know we'll
86:57 - certainly probably mentioned some of the
86:59 - awesome academic programs that we have
87:01 - going on or like we have a really cool
87:03 - study abroad program where students go
87:06 - to Austria and they live in like this I
87:09 - don't think I think I have a picture
87:12 - right right here like this isn't a stock
87:14 - photo these are our students in Austria
87:16 - and they live back here in this big
87:19 - building so it's some really old church
87:24 - with like a monastery type of thing in
87:28 - the same way with all these mission
87:30 - trips they take this is actually our
87:31 - student I assume she's in the nursing
87:34 - program she has the stethoscope but
87:36 - there's lots of cool stuff going on that
87:39 - we're definitely gonna want to put in
87:40 - there but we don't need to tell the
87:42 - entire story of what's going on we'll
87:44 - save that for interior pages so I think
87:47 - the goal the main goal is gonna be and
87:50 - this isn't really gonna be fall on me my
87:52 - boss is probably going to have to do a
87:54 - lot of the work of convincing people why
87:56 - we need to build a site this way and
87:59 - then I'll just provide support as much
88:01 - as I can probably in the form of a lot
88:03 - of data that as much data as I can to
88:06 - show that this will result in you know
88:09 - more students and more donations but the
88:15 - main thing is just going to be
88:17 - fencing you know convincing people to be
88:19 - on board with this and to not be too
88:22 - upset about stripping out content
88:24 - because I imagine there's going to be
88:26 - people that will be upset you know for
88:29 - instance you know look at all this
88:30 - content some people are going to be
88:32 - upset if they're no longer mentioned
88:35 - right we have a lot of text here and it
88:37 - mentions a lot of different programs we
88:39 - can't keep all of these in here right so
88:42 - yes whoever's in charge of you know this
88:46 - particular program are they going to be
88:49 - upset I maybe I don't know
88:53 - so anyway if there's going to be a lot
88:55 - of stuff that's not even necessarily as
88:56 - anything to do with web development
88:58 - that's just gonna have to be dealt with
89:01 - so to answer your question I know I went
89:05 - you know above and beyond what your
89:07 - original question was to answer the
89:09 - question potential students are the main
89:12 - audience but we're gonna keep in mind
89:15 - that they're gonna be alumni and and
89:18 - other donors that are going to be coming
89:20 - here and we want to give them something
89:22 - too so we'll definitely want to
89:26 - highlight for the students in for the
89:30 - donors we want to highlight some really
89:32 - awesome stuff that's going on here at
89:35 - the University so that it would appeal
89:38 - to both audiences as much as possible
89:40 - and we already have a site for our
89:45 - donors a separate site that we can send
89:47 - them to as well so we don't need to say
89:50 - everything on this page but maybe just a
89:53 - little bit and be able to send people to
89:56 - the right place
90:00 - let's see and we do already have some
90:02 - like some web sites that are just like
90:05 - one-page websites that have information
90:08 - about a specific program that we send
90:10 - people to from like Facebook ads and
90:12 - things like that they go to that one
90:14 - page thing and it really focuses just on
90:17 - that particular academic program just
90:20 - for students who are really interested
90:22 - in that you know sometimes we'll email
90:24 - students who said they're interested in
90:25 - let's say nursing or let's say
90:28 - counseling because I did a site for the
90:29 - counseling
90:30 - they can go right to that site they have
90:32 - a whole website dedicated just to that
90:34 - program and then if they want more info
90:36 - they can come to this site and get pages
90:38 - and pages of info but we're still gonna
90:41 - be doing things like that as well and
90:42 - that takes some of the pressure off of
90:44 - this main page to not have to cover
90:46 - everything but yet quite a lot of
90:51 - discussion and thought has gone into
90:52 - this already and we're it's been I've
90:59 - been wanting to redesign this since
91:01 - before I even got the job here
91:10 - John Henson says the original homepage
91:13 - has a 90 style bombardment of too much
91:15 - content yeah oh yeah I agree I it is is
91:22 - just way too much
91:23 - I mean I've I've looked at this web page
91:25 - for probably hours working here and I
91:28 - don't think I've ever read everything on
91:30 - here you know like I don't have any data
91:35 - on this would probably be cool to get
91:38 - the data and get a heat map but I would
91:42 - guess that the percentage of people that
91:43 - get to this point and the site is
91:45 - probably in the in the single digits of
91:48 - you know people that actually scroll all
91:51 - the way down there I mean especially can
91:53 - you imagine on a phone how long of a
91:55 - scroll this is you know we'll shrink
91:58 - this up I mean this is quite a scroll
92:03 - and really it's because this text is
92:09 - just so so tiny it makes it a little bit
92:13 - better scroll wise but you can't read
92:14 - that I mean that's that's extremely
92:17 - small I'm sure it's small for you all
92:19 - trying to watch on YouTube but even for
92:21 - me trying to look at it I got to put my
92:23 - face close to the screen to see that so
92:25 - I mean I I kind of feel like there's
92:28 - some shortcuts here in terms of font
92:30 - size that it shouldn't be like this font
92:33 - should be at least double the size which
92:36 - would make this page quite a bit longer
92:38 - so not only do we need to get rid of
92:41 - text but we need to increase the font
92:43 - size for readability like nobody's gonna
92:45 - you know try to read that I have to try
92:47 - to zoom in just to see it alright let me
92:53 - go let me get through some more of these
92:54 - questions
93:00 - oh cool Patrick hey Patrick how's it
93:04 - going
93:05 - I don't think Patrick did you get here
93:09 - later what I don't think I've seen you
93:10 - say anything the whole time but Patrick
93:16 - came through with a Emmett cheat sheet
93:18 - so Doc's Emmett do too EMM i ET EMM ET
93:23 - so Doc's Emmett I owe slash cheat sheet
93:27 - that's cheat - sheet so check that out
93:41 - no beer says can anyone suggest to me
93:44 - how to edit blogger website says please
93:48 - thanks in advance I've never used
93:52 - blogger so I don't know I don't really
93:57 - know how how to edit that if they give
93:59 - you access to be able to edit the HTML
94:01 - and CSS and JavaScript I would assume
94:04 - that would work you know just like any
94:05 - page but I'm not sure I guess it depends
94:09 - on what you wish you have access to
94:14 - okay so Rohan says the next edge release
94:17 - will have full support for CSS variables
94:21 - iOS already has it wow that's
94:25 - interesting I've always had trouble with
94:27 - with iOS with different things not being
94:30 - supported so that's that's really
94:32 - interesting okay I'll have to check
94:35 - check that out more let's see actually
94:38 - try right now can I use see if they have
94:44 - anything
94:48 - all right so CSS variables obviously in
94:51 - our Explorer 11 doesn't have that edge
94:53 - has partial support but it will be nice
94:56 - chromis
94:58 - I had no idea that they were this well
95:00 - supported the last time I last time I
95:04 - even thought about him I was watching a
95:06 - talk about them in I guess the talk was
95:10 - maybe it was a little bit older because
95:12 - the way they were talking about it was
95:15 - like no one supports them yet that's
95:18 - really cool though maybe I have to try
95:20 - it out okay
95:32 - hamed says so I'm like a fool beginner
95:36 - learning Python but I also want to learn
95:38 - the ropes of web development what
95:39 - resource should I go to I would say
95:43 - check out free code camp you know
95:47 - certainly the the YouTube channel but
95:50 - also you know free code camp
95:53 - what is it dot org or we don't word now
95:56 - I think we are I should know I'm sure
96:01 - there's a redirect in place as well but
96:03 - I think it's free code camp org and just
96:07 - try to go through some of the some of
96:09 - the lessons probably if you're learning
96:11 - Python you know a lot of the earliest
96:13 - stuff will be really easy you'll
96:15 - probably fly through it but that's a
96:18 - really good resource it kind of ramps up
96:21 - gradually unless you know some of the
96:23 - basics beyond that Udacity has a lot of
96:29 - free courses for web development most of
96:33 - them are a little bit get an in depth
96:36 - more into web development in particular
96:39 - areas more so than you'd get from free
96:41 - code camp you know unless you went all
96:42 - the way through and did some of the
96:43 - later things in free code camp so if
96:46 - there's a particular area you really
96:48 - want to focus on you could just take
96:49 - that course in Udacity so those those
96:53 - two resources have been very helpful to
96:55 - me and I mean there's a lot of other
96:59 - places for you can do courses code
97:06 - Academy is I've done a lot of things
97:09 - from there as well
97:18 - let's see
97:22 - Jambi says on browser support of CSS
97:24 - variables okay so basically just
97:31 - explaining it basically explaining this
97:36 - so I didn't see that before I brought
97:39 - this up so sorry John b-but I mean I
97:41 - guess this is a decent visual as well so
97:46 - not bad
97:48 - J says that was a good answer Jessie
97:51 - Thanks
97:51 - oh you're welcome I'm glad you thought
97:53 - was a good answer thanks for asking the
97:55 - question and let me gave me an excuse to
97:58 - explain the grand scheme for the site no
98:04 - beer says in response to Hamas question
98:08 - about learning web development it says
98:11 - one for front-end development learn HTML
98:15 - CSS JavaScript to build websites to
98:18 - perfect your skills 3 choose one server
98:20 - based language for example PHP Python
98:24 - Ruby for learned a database language
98:28 - like my sequel or MongoDB yeah I mean
98:31 - that I mean a very broad plan but that's
98:35 - basically I mean that's kind of pretty
98:38 - much how I've been going with that will
98:43 - yeah if you follow that you I mean you
98:45 - could be full stack that's you know if
98:48 - you get through all that Patrick all
98:53 - Patrick's is without the JavaScript
98:55 - happy react side I don't have much to
98:57 - contribute oh I'm sorry sorry faster I
99:01 - don't you know I kind of wondered when I
99:02 - would do this if there would be a shift
99:04 - in the people that wanted to watch so um
99:07 - there were probably people who watch
99:09 - because they're very interested in react
99:11 - or you know at least just JavaScript in
99:13 - general and then when they saw that I
99:16 - was doing dotnet stuff they might be
99:18 - less interested but then there may have
99:21 - been people who are interested in dotnet
99:22 - and c-sharp who started watching that
99:24 - didn't so I've seen I've seen some new
99:26 - faces and I've seen some people that I
99:29 - used to see I haven't
99:30 - is often so that's to be expected and
99:33 - you know it's not bad I think a lot of
99:35 - the stuff we're doing now is more
99:37 - friendly for beginners because we're
99:40 - really just doing a lot of basic HTML
99:42 - and CSS at this point and then we're
99:44 - spending a little bit of time trying to
99:46 - tie everything into these templates so
99:50 - it's not bad because you know with the
99:53 - react stuff sometimes we get in like
99:55 - really in-depth into things and you know
99:57 - a lot of the people say wow this is over
99:59 - my head you know I can't understand it
100:01 - and so I think it's a good it's a good
100:04 - mix so we'll be back to react actually
100:08 - in October so first week of October will
100:12 - be doing react stuff again we're going
100:14 - to go back to project one and we're
100:16 - gonna update it so I'm gonna get a list
100:19 - of requested updates right at the
100:22 - beginning of October we're gonna work on
100:23 - those while we're working on those I
100:26 - think it's definitely going to be a good
100:28 - idea to go in try to update our NPM
100:30 - packages if hopefully we can update and
100:33 - not mess things up
100:35 - same thing like new updates on our
100:37 - server it'd be great to try to refactor
100:41 - things maybe more testing so we're going
100:46 - to be back to it but for the rest of
100:49 - September at least we're probably going
100:51 - to be working on this site and unless
100:56 - something else comes up I mean you never
100:58 - know project one came up out of nowhere
101:00 - and I had to stop working on this this
101:03 - site this University site and then flip
101:07 - right to that project one and I haven't
101:11 - gotten back to it you know really in
101:13 - months so anyway we'll get back to it
101:16 - but Patrick I appreciate all the help
101:18 - that you've given before I mean you've
101:20 - given so much help you deserve a rest I
101:24 - think
101:36 - okay Jambi confirms it is free code camp
101:39 - dot org now i dial a I said I'm assuming
101:45 - that if you took do typing comm it would
101:47 - just redirect that I mean that seems
101:49 - like that would be a basic thing so but
101:53 - I think it's officially dot Ward and not
101:56 - I don't just think I know it is John B
101:59 - said it is so it is let's see okay John
102:06 - Hanson says Google tag manager is a
102:08 - simple interface to see what visitors
102:10 - actually click on scroll past or down
102:12 - how much time or any other interactions
102:14 - you want to check on okay cool I
102:18 - actually haven't used Google tag manager
102:21 - I took a like a course on it and then I
102:23 - never implemented it on anything so
102:26 - maybe I'll start using Google tag
102:28 - manager on some of the newer stuff I
102:31 - have used hot jar before I think it's
102:35 - hot jar and they have heat maps of
102:38 - things so I think that it's I use the
102:42 - free version I forget what their limits
102:44 - are so I'm not even sure if it would be
102:46 - that useful for the amount of traffic
102:48 - their sites get gets I would probably
102:50 - hit the limits from really quickly well
102:56 - Orleans says Firefox as has fonts since
103:00 - 2014 Chrome has since 2016 cool
103:12 - okay Theo says Theo says in response to
103:16 - the CMS answer that I gave to to the
103:19 - question thank you very much for
103:22 - clearing things up for me for some
103:23 - reason I thought that WordPress is just
103:25 - for websites that are made with no
103:26 - coding but just the visual editor oh
103:29 - yeah yeah I'm sorry I didn't really
103:31 - mention that that's like kind of a key a
103:33 - key thing so I guess most people use
103:36 - WordPress for that very reason
103:39 - it's just websites you can get a website
103:41 - up and you don't have to know code what
103:44 - we've been using WordPress for and our
103:47 - projects has been I guess what would
103:51 - some people call a headless CMS so I
103:54 - don't worry about any of the templates
103:56 - that come with WordPress we don't use
103:58 - them at all
103:58 - instead I pull all the data that's
104:02 - entered in through WordPress I pull it
104:05 - all with an API into a react project you
104:10 - can pull it into anything I actually
104:12 - have other sites where I'm pulling it
104:14 - into just a site that uses some jQuery
104:16 - and Ajax to to bring in the data but
104:20 - that's how I've been using WordPress and
104:22 - that's how I generally do use content
104:25 - management systems for projects I'm
104:28 - doing I do have some clients that use
104:32 - just a basic WordPress site which is
104:35 - fine for a lot of clients I don't think
104:39 - they really need a react site I like to
104:42 - do it I think they end up being a lot
104:44 - faster if you do it right but I think
104:51 - WordPress as it normally is used is
104:53 - still very useful for a lot of for a lot
104:56 - of people and it can be a very
104:59 - inexpensive way to get a website up
105:15 - okay and Theo says I've been using
105:17 - firebase for my projects lately and that
105:19 - kind of falls in the middle since it
105:21 - doesn't require any server-side
105:22 - programming cool I keep hearing about
105:24 - firebase I've had people ask me if I use
105:27 - firebase and think I'm gonna have to
105:29 - check out firebase more I did I remember
105:34 - checking it out a while back just kind
105:37 - of looking at you know what it all what
105:39 - it was about
105:39 - and I didn't have time to really
105:41 - practice it using it but I've so many
105:45 - people were talking about it to me
105:47 - lately III definitely need to try it out
105:52 - okay all right cool so I've gotten to
105:54 - the bottom of the live chat so that was
105:57 - a much longer question answer session
106:00 - than normal but that was it was really
106:02 - cool it's worth it got some good
106:03 - questions and hopefully helped helped
106:05 - you out for those either ask questions
106:08 - also got to explain my vision for this
106:12 - website okay I just got another question
106:15 - pop up here Baaraat says Jesse can you
106:19 - give some pointers on pulling data from
106:21 - WordPress yeah so WordPress core now
106:27 - comes with the API built in so you don't
106:30 - need you used to need to get a separate
106:32 - plugin you don't need that anymore so
106:33 - it's really easy when you're using the
106:37 - API I I recommend getting some plugins
106:41 - so check out on the API documentation
106:43 - page they actually have a list of
106:46 - plugins that work with the API run
106:48 - through that list see what things might
106:50 - be useful for you it really makes
106:53 - working with the API a lot easier there
106:56 - are some things that are just they're
107:00 - just inconvenient to work with so try
107:05 - out some of the plugins trying to think
107:09 - what I use now I'm drawing a blank off
107:13 - and you can check out like project one
107:16 - has some videos if you see my project
107:21 - one videos if any of them have that's
107:24 - WordPress in the title even time you may
107:27 - be able to see some of the plug
107:28 - I'm using and how I have it set up but
107:31 - it'll make getting the data easier and
107:38 - getting just the data that you want
107:40 - easier sometimes you may want to get
107:43 - posts from multiple post types and
107:47 - there's not an easy way to do that right
107:49 - off the bat but you can get a plugin
107:51 - that lets you get multiple post types
107:53 - you can pull it all in in one API call
107:56 - and not have to make multiple calls so
107:59 - that's really useful if you only need
108:01 - like one piece of data and you don't
108:04 - want to pull in all this other data that
108:06 - comes by default there's a plug-in
108:07 - that'll let you just filter out exactly
108:10 - what you need so you can make that the
108:12 - data just really small which doesn't
108:15 - really make a difference if you're
108:17 - getting just a few posts but if you're
108:18 - getting a lot of posts you just pull in
108:21 - the data you know just that you need so
108:24 - things like that or be really nice just
108:30 - make using it a lot easier yeah so just
108:35 - from memory there's kind of things that
108:37 - I that have helped me but check out I'm
108:42 - almost positive that I have some videos
108:44 - that have WordPress API in the title so
108:48 - if you can find those hopefully though
108:51 - they'll help you out as well and if you
108:53 - have any like specific questions when
108:54 - you're working with it feel free to ask
108:56 - them in the live chat or send me a
108:58 - message on Twitter or some other social
109:00 - media platform and I'll try to help you
109:03 - out if I can okay now I'm at the end of
109:08 - the live chat here again so I'm gonna
109:12 - finish things up here and I will be back
109:17 - tomorrow what's what is today alright
109:19 - tomorrow is Wednesday yeah I'll be back
109:22 - Wednesday so actually I probably won't
109:24 - get very much done because my wife has a
109:26 - doctor's appointment tomorrow morning I
109:28 - will be home with the kids
109:29 - I'll come in though into work in the
109:31 - afternoon most likely unless for some
109:35 - reason the appointment takes a really
109:37 - long time but I'll let every
109:40 - no probably be scheduling the event a
109:44 - little bit later than normal so I won't
109:45 - be in so you may not get the alert until
109:50 - later on or the tweet until later on but
109:54 - I think I should still be should still
109:57 - be here and as always if for some reason
110:00 - I can't stream I put that out on Twitter
110:02 - just to let you all know but anyway I
110:08 - will be back tomorrow
110:10 - most likely around 2 p.m. and I hope you
110:14 - all have a great day thank you so much
110:16 - for watching for contributing in the
110:17 - live chat I really appreciate it and
110:19 - I'll see everyone tomorrow
