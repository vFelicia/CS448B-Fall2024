00:07 - hey everybody it's
00:09 - Jesse and uh happy Monday hope everybody
00:14 - had a good weekend uh at the end of last
00:17 - week I was working from home my streams
00:19 - were not not the same quality in terms
00:22 - of uh video quality so I could barely
00:27 - keep 720p I am back now
00:31 - in my
00:32 - office and uh so the quality in this
00:34 - stream should be a lot
00:37 - better today uh we're going to work on
00:42 - the masonry layout so at some point I
00:45 - think last week we uh we started working
00:48 - on this and we got to the point where it
00:51 - was working and it seemed like that was
00:55 - it uh I'll just have to do a few more
00:58 - things and and it would
01:01 - work but that's not that's not how it
01:04 - went so um I had some problems so I
01:08 - decided to do a part
01:11 - two to show those problems and hopefully
01:13 - fix them Today's show is going to
01:17 - be a little bit shorter than I have been
01:21 - doing so lately I've been doing really
01:23 - long uh shows because the the things
01:27 - we've been trying to get done have been
01:28 - a little bit more complicated
01:30 - and that's it's taking a while but I
01:32 - have a meeting at 3: uh 300 p.m. eastern
01:35 - time so in less than an hour so this
01:39 - definitely has to be less than an hour
01:42 - so I'll try to cut it off and start uh
01:44 - answering questions at at
01:48 - 2:30 and unless I can get this working
01:51 - sooner than that I don't I don't know
01:53 - maybe uh and then definitely be done you
01:57 - know before 3 so
02:00 - hey everybody we have some people in the
02:02 - live
02:03 - chat uh so how's it
02:08 - going hopefully the uh the lag time will
02:12 - be better too between when I say and do
02:14 - something and when when you all actually
02:17 - see
02:19 - it also have some upgrades um I got that
02:23 - new microphone hooked up on my work
02:25 - machine now so let me know if it doesn't
02:28 - sound good
02:31 - um I'm hoping that this is better sound
02:33 - quality than just the mic that comes
02:35 - with an iMac so if it's not I definitely
02:39 - want to know and and I can return the
02:40 - mic and maybe get a better one or just
02:42 - stick with what I
02:44 - had
02:47 - and oh the other big piece of exciting
02:50 - news that I have is I just upgraded my
02:52 - ram in this iMac so I have double the
02:54 - ram so that's always fun
02:58 - um I I've noticed it is slightly faster
03:01 - so we'll see the real test will be when
03:03 - I have a million tabs open and uh we'll
03:06 - see if it if it still holds
03:09 - up but let me um let me show you the
03:13 - problem that I'm having
03:19 - and where' it go sorry I just had it oh
03:23 - okay so let me show you the issue first
03:26 - I got to go in so we're on a branch so
03:28 - let me do a get
03:31 - checkout so if you're not familiar with
03:33 - Git You can make these branches which
03:35 - are basically like alternate versions of
03:38 - your um of your app or of your site and
03:42 - you can just switch between them so
03:44 - they're like they're like parallel
03:46 - universes in programming uh so if you
03:50 - you can try out some crazy thing on one
03:52 - branch and it doesn't matter if you
03:53 - totally mess it up because you switch
03:54 - back to your master branch and
03:56 - everything is is like it like it should
03:58 - be and you can use that to push um
04:02 - depending on how your deployment is you
04:04 - know that could be the the branch that's
04:06 - stable uh and you actually push out to
04:08 - your server
04:10 - so I'm going to switch to the masonry
04:20 - branch
04:23 - and now we should be able to
04:28 - see I'm going to bring up the site on
04:33 - I'm on my other screen right now
04:35 - bringing it
04:36 - up
04:37 - um what page resources
04:44 - okay so here we go here's the page right
04:48 - and look it looks like masonry is is
04:51 - working this is what we were left with
04:53 - you know last week after we got this
04:56 - going but when I click this tab you can
05:00 - see definitely not working and this is
05:02 - actually even worse than what it
05:04 - normally gives me usually I can at least
05:06 - get like this layout but the Footers
05:09 - back here but uh this time I couldn't
05:12 - even get
05:13 - that let me see yeah okay so here's what
05:16 - I normally get something like
05:18 - this
05:20 - so that's obviously not what we want and
05:25 - also I haven't tested the images yet I'm
05:27 - assuming that'll work it talks about it
05:29 - in documentation
05:31 - for um the react uh component that we
05:35 - use and this is the component in case
05:37 - you you weren't watching uh when we
05:39 - first started this I'm using react
05:41 - masonry component and um this is a react
05:45 - component that that uses the masonry uh
05:48 - Library if you're familiar with masonry
05:50 - or isotope it's used on a lot of sites
05:54 - uh to get you know this kind
05:57 - of kind of effect you know all these are
06:00 - just positioned uh with JavaScript you
06:03 - know and so each one as As you move the
06:06 - page around the position changes so you
06:09 - always have you know kind of nice even
06:11 - spacing between
06:14 - everything
06:16 - so the problem is really I need to
06:19 - refresh the layout somehow uh when the
06:22 - tab is
06:24 - clicked
06:26 - and I think I I ran into this issue on
06:29 - on a site I did before but I wasn't
06:31 - using the react plug uh the react
06:35 - component I was using just
06:37 - masonry um you know just the the
06:40 - JavaScript plugin by itself so I had
06:43 - access to you know to everything that
06:45 - you can do with that so there was a way
06:47 - to just kind of refresh things when you
06:49 - when you press the
06:51 - tab so that's kind of what I need to do
06:54 - at least what I think will fix this
06:56 - problem but I haven't been able to
06:58 - figure out how how to do
07:01 - it uh there's not really at least on on
07:06 - the documentation here I have not
07:10 - seen how to do
07:12 - that I did find something in the
07:20 - issues yeah they have these triggers so
07:23 - like on images loaded on layout complete
07:25 - on remove complete so I don't really
07:27 - need the trigger I will need images
07:29 - loaded at some point
07:33 - but I don't need the uh the
07:39 - trigger what I need is you know that
07:42 - that refresh so does that make
07:48 - sense all right I'm just I'm checking
07:50 - the live chat just for a second so I
07:52 - have uh more people in here now uh
07:54 - talking
07:56 - so oh okay uh Sebastian says there's
07:59 - some weird Statics on oh you know what I
08:01 - have forgot to turn my fan off let me
08:03 - turn the fan off and see if that helps
08:06 - uh it's a little bit warm in here today
08:08 - so hopefully that that helps it was a
08:11 - oscillating fan so I imagine when the
08:13 - fan was blowing right on the mic uh that
08:16 - probably made the
08:25 - noise oh okay saying so it's probably
08:27 - not the fan
08:31 - it was some other s okay let
08:35 - me definitely not the fan so all right
08:38 - so if it's still happening oh someone's
08:41 - saying it was the fan let me I'm going
08:43 - to do a little bit more at least with
08:44 - that
08:48 - mic and just see if it keeps happening
08:51 - uh if not if it's gets really bad let me
08:54 - know and then I'll just uh switch to the
08:57 - uh to the internal mic and
09:00 - um yeah I'm I'm not sure it wasn't a
09:03 - really expensive mic uh so I read some
09:06 - of the reviews uh on Amazon said that it
09:09 - was better than the internal mic so I
09:11 - thought I'd give it a
09:14 - shot and um we'll see maybe uh maybe I
09:18 - need to go with something a little bit
09:20 - more expensive a little better
09:28 - quality
09:32 - okay
09:34 - so what I'm going to do is
09:37 - um I'm going to go to these
09:42 - issues
09:48 - and trying to I should have um I think I
09:52 - still have the issue open on my laptop
09:54 - and I should have checked that
09:58 - out
10:00 - layout
10:02 - complete H that's not it's not exactly
10:05 - what I want to
10:07 - do
10:11 - um can't remember what the issues
10:18 - are I may be able to just look at what
10:22 - tabs are open on my laptop right
10:25 - now
10:27 - and just open it from
10:38 - there there we go so I'm just going to
10:41 - open the um the
10:46 - issues from my tabs all right nice
10:49 - that's a nice feature if you're using
10:51 - Chrome and you're logged in on multiple
10:54 - devices uh you can see what's open on
10:56 - all of them so uh I on my other screen I
10:59 - just opened some some of the issues
11:05 - that that had to do with at least some
11:10 - somewhat had to do
11:13 - with the issue that we're dealing
11:24 - with okay so this is what let me bring
11:27 - this over this is what I found that I
11:30 - think might help
11:33 - so and I couldn't get this to work uh
11:37 - maybe late last week I was working on it
11:41 - and basically you can bind this instance
11:45 - of
11:46 - masonry and then you can you should be
11:50 - able to do something like this you know
11:52 - this masonry on layout complete and you
11:56 - know do
11:57 - something
12:01 - so I couldn't get I couldn't get it to
12:04 - the point where I could bind it and
12:06 - actually access this it kept telling me
12:08 - you know like this you know doesn't
12:11 - exist
12:15 - so let me
12:17 - check let's go to our
12:22 - code and we're on the resources
12:25 - page let me make this a bit bigger for
12:28 - you all
12:32 - and I don't really need this right
12:34 - [Music]
12:37 - now and I don't
12:42 - need I don't need that side pen all
12:45 - right so P that'll give us more
12:48 - space okay so you see we have M these uh
12:52 - components now on just the first two
12:55 - tabs so the the tab that has everything
12:58 - and then the the tab that just has the
12:59 - audio
13:01 - cards uh you know we have masonry here
13:06 - we're going to try to
13:09 - add
13:14 - these we're going to try to add
13:17 - this on one of them just to see if we
13:21 - can get something get something
13:27 - going
13:33 - okay
13:35 - um then we should be able to call
13:37 - something like this
13:41 - so let's just let's just copy this I
13:44 - know this this isn't exactly what we
13:45 - want to do right now but this will be a
13:48 - good first
13:49 - step uh so I'm just going to go up here
13:51 - and put actually I already have
13:53 - component did Mount so I don't need to
13:55 - copy the whole
13:57 - thing
14:03 - okay so there's masonry on layout
14:07 - complete
14:11 - let's all right so I guess we'll do we
14:14 - we will put a layout complete
14:18 - Handler and let's just do something
14:21 - simple
14:22 - like
14:27 - um
14:35 - all
14:38 - right let's save that and
14:42 - hopefully hopefully we'll see that uh I
14:46 - was just wondering about with server
14:47 - side rendering maybe
14:50 - um no it shouldn't worry because well
14:54 - we'll see we'll test
14:56 - it
14:57 - uh
15:00 - there we go back here and I'm going to
15:05 - inspect this so we can see the
15:10 - console and first I want to click just
15:13 - to see if there's any difference now so
15:16 - you see whatever
15:19 - tab that's pretty odd now I'm have I
15:23 - have these things appearing
15:26 - H what did we do here
15:45 - that's really weird I'm going to refresh
15:46 - this because i' I've never had that I
15:49 - don't know why that's
15:57 - happening
16:10 - okay I'm going to check the live chat
16:11 - see if someone did I put
16:15 - okay uh so good uh so Patrick in the
16:18 - live chat mentioned I must have that in
16:23 - the in the
16:25 - jsx where do I have that should
16:32 - be
16:33 - oh you're right I I must have
16:36 - accidentally put that oh I know what I
16:38 - did um I pressed uh the the wrong key
16:43 - when I was trying to close this pain the
16:45 - um command slash like
16:51 - um I guess it be like the back slash I
16:54 - can't ever remember which one's forward
16:55 - slash and which one's back slash but one
16:57 - of them makes a comment and the other
17:00 - one toggles this pain on the side so I
17:04 - pressed the wrong one and didn't realize
17:05 - that I commented that okay so that fixes
17:08 - that uh not really our problem that
17:11 - we're trying to deal with but good catch
17:13 - on that Patrick thank
17:25 - you okay I did have a question about
17:28 - masonry is but it looks like it got
17:30 - answered um in the live chat
17:38 - so uh in case you are just joining um M
17:43 - and you have the same question masonry
17:46 - layout is I mean this this is what it is
17:48 - what it ends up looking like where you
17:50 - you can have uh content of different
17:52 - heights uh you can even have different
17:54 - widths if you wanted to um and then it
17:57 - all Lays out nicely with you see there's
18:00 - always uh the same space between them
18:03 - you know on all sides uh and
18:06 - it you know it keeps that space no
18:08 - matter what uh so you see as we do this
18:11 - our our width and height
18:13 - changes but it still it still works so
18:16 - that's basically a masonry layout so and
18:18 - then there's a JavaScript plugin called
18:21 - masonry that we're also
18:27 - using all right so what I'm not
18:31 - getting
18:34 - is any any
18:37 - logging from what we wanted here so we
18:40 - wanted this console log layout complete
18:43 - Handler this layout complete Handler
18:44 - okay so this should
18:46 - have it should have done
18:49 - something although now I don't remember
18:51 - when we
18:53 - do I just want to test this
18:57 - because I'm not sure with our server
19:00 - side rendering if I should even see this
19:02 - on the on the client
19:05 - side maybe if I
19:11 - um maybe if we do our client side
19:14 - routing and uh then we'll see that I'll
19:17 - give it a try either
19:19 - way so first I'll I'll do a hard refresh
19:22 - and this should give us the
19:25 - um the completely rendered h
19:33 - HML it's assuming
19:36 - my I'm going to just restart this so I
19:39 - still I know I've said this several
19:41 - times but I still haven't figured out
19:43 - what the issue is with why uh my Dev
19:47 - server just
19:49 - keeps like
19:51 - hanging
19:52 - um it's starting to get pretty annoying
19:55 - so I think I'll I'll figure it
19:57 - out okay so I did
20:00 - get let me bring this over here and show
20:03 - you that I did actually
20:07 - get that console log
20:10 - so so we can see that that actually did
20:13 - work so what should have happened is we
20:15 - should have got those three exclamation
20:18 - points that are
20:21 - in that are here layout complete Handler
20:25 - I'm just double-checking that I spelled
20:27 - everything right yeah so this should
20:29 - have worked because our
20:34 - layout our layout should have been
20:39 - complete
20:41 - um I wonder if there's some issue with
20:45 - me using uh two
20:48 - instances of of
20:51 - masonry let's see let me um I'm going to
20:54 - switch it to this one just to check you
20:57 - know maybe
20:59 - see if we have any luck with the with
21:01 - the first one instead of the second
21:03 - one the
21:07 - um the hot module reloading does some
21:09 - weird things sometimes like
21:14 - that okay so I did get it this time so
21:18 - that we so we got these exclamation
21:20 - points this
21:22 - time uh so that's what we
21:25 - wanted I'm going to click click around
21:29 - here see if I can get him
21:36 - again scroll
21:40 - up oops wrong page we're on resources
21:43 - right there we go that's why I didn't
21:45 - get it okay so I did get it again so
21:47 - both when we do
21:50 - um I'm going to do a hard refresh double
21:52 - check that great so the client side
21:57 - routing we still get this so it it Bas
21:59 - so it works for some reason though it
22:03 - did not work when we had it on the
22:05 - second masonry
22:08 - element that's not good
22:10 - news so you need to be able to use this
22:13 - multiple times or else I have to rethink
22:15 - how this is laid
22:18 - out plan B could be if I need to if I
22:23 - can't get this to work with with
22:26 - multiple um instan of this masonry
22:29 - component on the same page then if I
22:31 - need to all of them could be within one
22:34 - masonry component and then we could do
22:37 - some sort of
22:42 - sorting some kind of sorting where I can
22:46 - pick
22:48 - um pick the categories and they all just
22:51 - all the cards are just shown in in head
22:54 - I don't know if masonry can do that
22:58 - right off the bat I'll have to check I
22:59 - know isotope which is a JavaScript
23:02 - plugin built by the same guy that built
23:05 - masonry isotope does do some cool things
23:07 - with sorting so I have to check that out
23:10 - isotope though is not free to use so may
23:13 - have to buy buy a um a license for that
23:18 - uh and then see if it works with this
23:20 - with this
23:22 - component uh I'm going to see
23:26 - thoughts
23:28 - actually uh bro
23:31 - bromo Matic uh says were you calling
23:34 - both of them this masonry actually no I
23:37 - was just using one at a time my next
23:40 - step was going to be okay do we need to
23:43 - call these different things
23:52 - um yeah I I guess that could be the next
23:56 - step let's see if we
24:09 - can yeah let's see if we can do
24:11 - something like that where we just give
24:13 - this a
24:18 - um I'm just going to put a two on the
24:20 - end I probably will not keep that keep
24:23 - that naming but uh for now we'll see if
24:26 - it works
24:55 - all right so let's see what we're going
24:56 - to get wow
24:58 - I don't know I really need to um figure
25:01 - out what is going on with
25:04 - my wow
25:07 - okay all right well I can at least see
25:10 - something I'm still getting this but I'm
25:11 - not getting um that second
25:14 - one and what force Reflow ask
25:22 - JavaScript all right so I haven't really
25:24 - seen this happen
25:26 - before
25:29 - so I'm guessing that whatever I just did
25:33 - here with this is not going to work
25:37 - out yeah I mean it's not like I did
25:39 - anything different all I did was just
25:41 - add this in a second time and then up
25:45 - here yeah I just added this there's
25:47 - nothing in here that I see that really
25:50 - should have caused this so
25:55 - um let me check one do another page just
25:58 - to verify that it's it's something on
26:02 - that page that's doing
26:07 - it actually maybe it's maybe I do need
26:10 - to restart the
26:11 - server
26:15 - um all right we'll try it one more time
26:18 - I don't really have at this point much
26:20 - hope that I can get both of them working
26:23 - so it may have to just think of some
26:24 - something
26:26 - else
26:32 - while I'm okay that should be up
26:36 - now Vlad asked Sublime Tex or adom which
26:40 - program better to use thanks uh I've
26:43 - never use Sublime so I can't really say
26:46 - I do I like Adam it
26:49 - is I've noticed Adam is slower than like
26:54 - Visual Studio
26:55 - code uh so
26:58 - I can't compare it to Sublime you know
27:00 - myself I've heard that sublime's a lot
27:04 - faster I mean I I like
27:08 - Adam I'm open to switching to something
27:10 - else though it's just hard to switch
27:12 - when you have all your packages set up
27:13 - the way you want
27:20 - them Okay it definitely is that page so
27:23 - let's take this out
27:26 - then
27:31 - we
27:51 - at all right
27:54 - since since the way that is given in the
27:58 - documentation to Target a specific
28:00 - component seems like at least at this
28:03 - point it only works if I put it on the
28:05 - first instance of this component then I
28:08 - think I'm this is a dead end that I'm
28:09 - trying to go down here
28:12 - um so we need to switch it and try
28:16 - something else okay so I'm just going
28:23 - to I'm G to kind of mess everything up
28:26 - here
28:40 - yeah so since this first instance is
28:46 - really all I
28:48 - need it'll it'll contain everything
28:51 - there are reasons that I wanted to split
28:53 - it out like this one of them being that
28:55 - um there's a limit
28:58 - by default on how many um how many posts
29:02 - you can get back when you make an API
29:04 - call to Wordpress which is what the uh
29:06 - all this content is where it's coming
29:09 - from so uh I thought it would just be a
29:11 - lot easier
29:13 - if at some point I could make separate
29:16 - calls for each one of these
29:18 - but there are other ways to get around
29:22 - that and I think that's an easier
29:24 - problem than trying to dig into this
29:27 - component and see see what I need to do
29:31 - so
29:34 - let's oops I forgot to take out the
29:37 - stuff at the top
29:40 - and something up here
29:43 - was messing this
29:52 - up so
29:55 - hopefully this will work now
29:58 - great okay so that works um now we have
30:03 - everything here of course these are not
30:06 - going to work anymore so what we need to
30:09 - do then is have some other way of
30:12 - switching these
30:15 - out uh which I think we can we
30:20 - can figure that out in where' I put
30:26 - that
30:28 - okay so let me
30:30 - search I know I saw somebody
30:36 - else pretty sure so somebody
30:40 - else how to filter select item just like
30:43 - example there we go I think that's the
30:44 - one we
30:48 - need it's SL slow all
30:56 - right
31:07 - H okay so it looks like there's not a
31:09 - built-in filter like with with
31:13 - isotope
31:23 - um all right so here's
31:26 - what
31:29 - I think we'll have to do
31:33 - then let me check this one as
31:36 - well was that one
31:51 - isotope
31:56 - Maybe
31:59 - so it looks like they do have a branch
32:00 - that works with
32:11 - isotope all right let me go back I'm
32:13 - going to check the live chat see if
32:15 - anyone has any
32:26 - ideas
32:29 - okay uh bromo mtic says maybe have one
32:32 - masonry component and clicking on the
32:34 - the all audio you know video buttons
32:37 - will change as the filter inside that
32:39 - one that one
32:45 - instance yeah I think that's that's
32:48 - probably what what needs to
32:56 - happen
33:00 - okay
33:17 - so let me look at I I want to see what
33:21 - the uh Json looks like here to see what
33:23 - I
33:25 - can what I can filter by I don't
33:28 - remember what I called everything so
33:30 - we're going to take a look at
33:55 - that
34:01 - okay I'll bring this over so you can see
34:03 - what I'm looking at um here's
34:06 - [Music]
34:07 - our here's the data that we're
34:10 - getting uh we're actually not getting
34:12 - this much I am narrowing it down a bit
34:16 - um you can see we're getting that up
34:19 - here uh so we're making this call here
34:23 - and we're actually just getting the
34:24 - title and then these custom fields that
34:26 - we set up
34:27 - [Music]
34:29 - um so in these custom Fields okay so I
34:33 - do have a field called type so this is
34:36 - what we need to check
34:47 - for okay
34:52 - so
34:55 - let's
35:02 - so I think I do want them all to show up
35:04 - at first so that this is going to stay
35:06 - the same this is going to be the first
35:08 - the first load uh what's going to happen
35:11 - then is when we
35:13 - click so let's add a click where's our
35:25 - tabs
35:31 - oh here there sorry I was looking at the
35:33 - wrong one this is what we want this is
35:35 - has all of them here's our tabs uh so
35:38 - let's
35:38 - see we'll put a
35:43 - click on click that's how it is in react
35:47 - right it's just it's on
35:55 - click
35:58 - I'm I'm checking the uh live chat just
36:02 - quickly Thor says no idea about
36:04 - front-end development especially not
36:06 - with react can't help sorry it's all
36:09 - right
36:13 - um uh Mark ask what is isotope okay so
36:16 - isotope is um just a a JavaScript uh
36:20 - plugin
36:22 - that sorts out you can sort out uh HTML
36:26 - elements um in like a grid so think like
36:30 - um like Pinterest like how it's all laid
36:32 - out in a grid like this uh so like this
36:36 - but isotope lets you like let's say I'd
36:38 - click on these and it would just sort
36:40 - them on the Fly uh so they would all you
36:43 - know come in and come out and Resort and
36:44 - everything uh really easily it can do
36:46 - other stuff too but that's mainly what
36:48 - I've used isotope
36:54 - for yeah actually Sebastian has a good
36:57 - point plan C I can just use masonry
36:59 - client
37:03 - side that's actually
37:06 - not that's not a terrible idea uh that's
37:10 - that might be a good
37:13 - idea I'm going to take a second to just
37:15 - think what would be the fastest way so I
37:18 - the the most to me the best way would be
37:22 - to me to figure out how to do this like
37:24 - the react way right uh with with within
37:26 - that
37:27 - context but a way to do it that would
37:30 - definitely work and it might it might
37:32 - make sense to just get this working
37:34 - right now uh and then work on the other
37:36 - stuff later on would be just to use
37:39 - masonry as on its own without being you
37:43 - know imported you know via this react
37:45 - masonry
37:47 - component
37:49 - um and
37:53 - then then I would have access to
37:56 - everything
38:01 - let's just do that because otherwise I
38:04 - don't think there's any way I'm going to
38:05 - get this to work right now since I well
38:07 - since I've never done it before and I've
38:09 - done the other way before
38:12 - so if I have any chance of getting this
38:14 - working today I doesn't have to be
38:16 - working today but I'd like for it to be
38:18 - working today then I'm going to go with
38:20 - Sebastian's suggestion so here's what
38:23 - we're going to do we're going to go to
38:25 - Masonry
38:28 - there we go we go to the Mason website
38:31 - and I'm going to just pull in everything
38:34 - from the CDN for
38:39 - now
38:44 - and because that'll be the
38:47 - fastest that way I don't have to
38:49 - download anything and we can just try it
38:50 - out and see if it
38:52 - works so I'm going to throw this it I
38:55 - guess it doesn't even really matter
38:56 - where I put this um just put it in
39:00 - here uh let me take out this react
39:04 - masonry
39:05 - component and let's take
39:09 - out where we've used masonry here and
39:12 - let's just make this a
39:21 - div
39:25 - and
39:27 - I don't even need this div actually
39:28 - let's just take it
39:34 - out okay so we don't need that div
39:39 - and
39:41 - column okay so we're going to S on the
39:43 - column um let's
39:48 - grab I think that's it I think that's
39:50 - all we need let's let's remove this I'm
39:52 - just trying to get rid of everything so
39:53 - we don't get any
39:55 - errors
40:03 - don't need that
40:07 - okay um so this is wow what did I
40:22 - do and I need to add
40:25 - these
40:27 - these other things in as well at some
40:29 - point um so we need to add back our
40:33 - categories because we're going to be
40:34 - able to use uh the the tabs like we were
40:37 - hopefully um we can get that to
40:52 - work so let me I'm just going to copy
40:55 - and paste on my other uh monitor I'm
40:58 - just going to copy and paste from the
41:00 - get repo what we have on the master
41:02 - Branch because that'll that's basically
41:04 - what we
41:10 - need I either could do that or I could
41:12 - just hold down you know command Z for
41:15 - like a minute and it would probably get
41:16 - us back to where we wanted but I'd still
41:18 - have to change out the uh masonry
41:25 - components
41:32 - okay Patrick said there was some audio
41:34 - static so it it for sure was not the fan
41:37 - which which is what we thought uh that
41:40 - it wasn't the fan anyway
41:43 - [Music]
41:45 - so I may be returning this
41:51 - microphone because I definitely don't
41:53 - need the
41:55 - static
42:03 - all right the microphone I really wanted
42:05 - was not the one that I got anyway so I
42:08 - don't know if I can justify buying the
42:10 - one that I really
42:11 - wanted but I think it's like a 100 bucks
42:15 - it's not like an insane amount of money
42:20 - but you know it's not really necessary I
42:23 - think everybody could hear me with the
42:24 - built-in mic all right so we
42:29 - have here's everything and oh man that
42:32 - was ugly uh they just copied in really
42:38 - really ugly looking
42:40 - so that's
42:42 - better okay so let's save that
42:46 - and just verify that this is
42:52 - working oh that's what was happening I
42:55 - left that on click and
42:57 - there U sorry I'm scrolling around
42:59 - really fast I hope I'm not making
43:01 - anybody like motion sick that would
43:04 - probably make me motion sick if I were
43:08 - watching I do I need to keep an eye on
43:11 - the time and not forget about that I
43:12 - should have set an alarm but I did
43:16 - not uh okay 242 I can go for maybe about
43:20 - 10 more minutes it doesn't look like
43:22 - there's really
43:23 - any um any questions as I'm kind of
43:27 - scrolling around or at least I did
43:30 - answer a few questions as we were going
43:33 - so
43:34 - uh so we may not even really have a a
43:38 - kind of question
43:40 - answer uh session at the end of this
43:42 - video like we normally do uh because it
43:45 - doesn't look like there's any questions
43:46 - if you do have questions uh throw them
43:47 - in there now uh into the live chat and
43:50 - then that way I know and I'll um I'll
43:52 - try to end early enough so that I could
43:54 - get to them
43:59 - and uh as always if you uh don't get
44:01 - your question in in the live chat if
44:03 - you're watching later or something then
44:06 - you
44:08 - can okay this is it this this looks bad
44:11 - but this is what it should look like uh
44:12 - then you can always put it in the
44:14 - comments on the video or you can uh
44:17 - message me on Twitter and I'll answer
44:19 - you uh whenever I get a chance so I do
44:22 - answer everybody all the comments and
44:24 - everything and any messages anybody
44:26 - sends me I do answer it sometimes it's a
44:28 - few days before I can get to it but uh I
44:31 - definitely try to answer uh every
44:33 - question all right so that's what we
44:35 - want it to look like right
44:37 - now so now since we've imported uh
44:42 - masonry
44:44 - here now
44:47 - let's initialize
44:50 - it I don't really want to initialize it
44:52 - with jQuery even though I could I'd
44:54 - rather just use uh van
44:57 - uh
44:58 - JavaScript cuz I'm
45:03 - not I guess I'm let me grab this element
45:07 - argument if
45:12 - you yeah this is what I
45:16 - need
45:18 - okay so we'll do it in component did
45:22 - Mount
45:24 - um
45:27 - let's call this and then make
45:40 - this actually do I need to
45:43 - say I probably need to do that right let
45:46 - me know if that's uh the case but I
45:49 - think I do need to do that um now we can
45:52 - paste this in
45:54 - here and and I can change
46:01 - these cons just to keep it
46:05 - consistent and the query
46:10 - selector
46:12 - is it's going to be
46:18 - row
46:23 - no yeah it will be
46:27 - it will be row because each one is going
46:28 - to be its own sorry I'm thinking out
46:30 - loud here um normally you would have you
46:33 - know
46:35 - one you know one encompassing element
46:38 - for everything but in this case we're
46:40 - going to have multiple
46:42 - so yeah it would be row actually I
46:44 - should just look to save
46:47 - time I did this on a project where I was
46:51 - using react I'm pretty sure I was
46:53 - doing nearly the same thing I didn't
46:56 - have four tabs I think I just did it
46:58 - with two uh but I should check that
47:01 - before I try to redo what I what I've
47:04 - already
47:06 - done um that would be a waste of
47:12 - time so let me
47:15 - see and I think that one is um a private
47:19 - repo so if you won't be able to see that
47:23 - one if you wanted to follow along
47:26 - yeah it is
47:28 - private but this one that I'm working on
47:30 - now is public so um you can check that
47:34 - out if you want to uh links in the
47:39 - description all
47:44 - right all right so let me bring this
47:46 - over just so you can see you see what
47:49 - I'm seeing let me go over here
47:53 - um this might be a little small sorry
47:55 - about about that but there's a lot of
47:56 - stuff so I think we need it need to be
47:58 - able to see most of this okay so I'm
48:00 - bringing in
48:05 - h here we go so I actually have named I
48:09 - have quite quite a lot of things going
48:10 - on here so we have this
48:16 - container wow this kind of looks like a
48:18 - mess I don't know what I was thinking
48:20 - um
48:22 - probably I think I had a lot of this
48:24 - from an earlier project that I just
48:26 - copied and and uh so this is not all
48:29 - necessary but it was easy okay so I I do
48:33 - have the basic structure is pretty much
48:36 - the
48:37 - same although it looks
48:40 - like I've kind of messed with the the
48:43 - normal layout here and the the container
48:46 - for everything is a column instead of a
48:49 - row so I don't want to do that again
48:51 - what I really want to see though is how
48:54 - I've set up I to uh to work here so you
48:58 - see I do have two of
49:02 - these and it looks
49:05 - like I just kind of have the container
49:07 - inside what would this would be my
49:10 - row
49:11 - um
49:13 - normally yeah I don't know why I have
49:15 - this this stuff nested so deeply
49:19 - but I'm going to go to uh I'm going to
49:22 - have to go into
49:24 - the the J JavaScript because I did not
49:26 - put that in the
49:30 - component let's
49:34 - see all right let
49:37 - me let me see where am I at upload
49:45 - search okay I think this is
49:48 - it I'm going to take this off the screen
49:50 - I just want to double check and make
49:52 - sure there's nothing in this file that
49:53 - should not be public
50:00 - no I don't think there
50:14 - is all right
50:20 - so I might actually be using isotope and
50:24 - not Masonry which is not a huge deal uh
50:27 - cuz they're similar enough but it looks
50:29 - like I am using as the item selector the
50:31 - column and as the container I'm using
50:33 - isope container so I think if I just
50:37 - put you know basically the row here I'll
50:41 - I'll give the row a class and
50:45 - then as the item Ed column that should
50:49 - work yeah so let's do that and then
50:53 - that'll be that'll probably be the last
50:55 - last thing we could do so we can at
50:56 - least just see if this
50:58 - works and I don't know we'll see
51:05 - if okay Andrew ask can we get your uh
51:09 - GitHub user script theme so yeah my
51:13 - theme for GitHub
51:15 - is it's the GitHub dark
51:18 - script uh and I'm using um tamper monkey
51:22 - to run that so I it's not a Custom
51:26 - Custom script that I did so if you look
51:27 - up GitHub dark script I think there's
51:30 - instructions for how to use it in
51:31 - different browsers uh with different
51:33 - plugins so uh check that out uh it's
51:37 - really cool there's also lots of options
51:38 - you can customize it if you want I'm
51:40 - just using the base um you know the
51:44 - default options right now all right so
51:48 - let's
51:50 - do let's give these
51:54 - rows
51:58 - let's
52:02 - go let's make a masonry containers and
52:07 - then I think we should be good within
52:09 - that to say that the just the columns so
52:13 - want this to
52:15 - be masonry container and then this one
52:20 - is going to be the
52:22 - column okay let's see what happens when
52:25 - we do
52:29 - that let's let me try to
52:34 - refresh no I really need to fix just fix
52:38 - this this Dev server and figure out why
52:40 - it's not I've never had this happen on
52:42 - any other sites that I've used next to
52:44 - build this is the first time this has
52:46 - happened so I'm not not really sure
52:48 - what's going
52:50 - on okay oh okay so something's happened
52:54 - this isn't exactly what I want um so I'm
52:57 - going to have to work on it a
53:00 - bit you know I don't want this I
53:03 - obviously want this in four columns but
53:05 - we can
53:06 - see is it not working on
53:17 - there maybe it's just working on the
53:19 - first one all right so it's definitely
53:22 - it looks like
53:24 - it's it's doing something on the first
53:26 - one and we'll verify this by inspecting
53:29 - it and checking out yeah the positioning
53:33 - so we can see like it's being
53:36 - positioned here uh so that's it let's
53:39 - see if it's doing it on any other
53:49 - tabs it might not be I might have
53:53 - to H
53:57 - H yeah
54:01 - so oh yeah definitely need some
54:05 - work but at least we got it to
54:08 - initialize we just need to work on the
54:14 - um just some of the settings that we can
54:17 - use uh so basically I don't know if I'll
54:20 - do a part three to this I might just do
54:22 - it it looks like there's not like a ton
54:23 - of interest in this at least let me know
54:25 - if if I'm wrong here but uh just based
54:28 - on like the number of viewers we're
54:29 - getting it's a little bit lower than
54:31 - normal so I'm wondering I mean maybe
54:32 - it's just Monday and everybody's busy
54:34 - but um maybe there's just not a lot of
54:36 - interest in this topic so maybe there
54:38 - might not be a part three maybe I might
54:40 - just um I'll just get it working and
54:42 - then if you're interested you can check
54:43 - out the the uh repo and uh ask me
54:46 - questions if you want
54:48 - to uh but basically if you were going to
54:50 - do this if you want of the next steps
54:52 - The Next Step would simply be um
54:55 - to so first of all I'll probably need to
54:58 - add another
55:01 - um like a container element or something
55:04 - because these columns are getting messed
55:06 - up I need to keep these column classes
55:08 - or I need to somehow I need to set the
55:11 - columns correctly like like I can't have
55:14 - this column with here um I should never
55:17 - left that in uh so I need to set it so
55:21 - that it respects oh cool there we go so
55:24 - just fix that
55:25 - I guess I needed to respect the columns
55:28 - that we had that looks nice that's
55:30 - actually working
55:31 - so so that's that's fixed great so
55:34 - basically all you need to do now is just
55:36 - put some click uh handlers on each one
55:39 - of those tabs these these tabs here and
55:43 - then each time a click
55:46 - happens yeah see that's not that's not
55:49 - work see each time a click happens it
55:52 - would then um kind of re init refresh uh
55:57 - what's going on with
56:00 - um with masonry all right so we'll have
56:03 - to redo kind of like this thing for each
56:06 - one of these on click so worst case
56:09 - scenario it actually destroys the first
56:12 - instance of it and then reinit on this
56:15 - one and then gets destroyed so I don't
56:18 - know hopefully I can just do like a
56:20 - refresh but that's probably what needs
56:22 - to be done um off to check the docs
56:25 - again it's been a while since I looked
56:27 - at the docs for masonry but that's the
56:29 - process so that's what I'm going to try
56:31 - and uh that's what I'll work on probably
56:32 - tomorrow morning so let me check
56:37 - quickly and see if there's any questions
56:40 - here at the bottom and then I got to go
56:43 - um go to my meeting at 3:00 which is in
56:47 - 4
56:49 - minutes luckily the meeting is just
56:52 - like like 10 ft from my door
57:03 - uh Mark Twain asks have you ever used
57:06 - Google uh metadata in your project is
57:08 - that an improvement for SEO um I'm not
57:12 - sure Google
57:13 - met uh I probably won't be able to
57:16 - explain this I don't have enough time
57:17 - because I need to ask what you mean do
57:19 - you mean just like the normal metadata
57:21 - like title tag and um descript SEO
57:24 - description
57:25 - or like the actual meta tags I don't use
57:28 - like The
57:29 - Meta um like the keywords I don't use
57:33 - those at all I don't think they have any
57:35 - benefit to SEO anymore but title tags
57:38 - definitely uh have a big benefit
57:40 - descriptions don't really uh benefit
57:42 - your ranking but it's good for like
57:44 - actual humans when they read that um
57:48 - let's
57:53 - see
57:57 - yeah uh bromo MX says we should totally
57:59 - do it the react way yeah I definitely do
58:02 - want to do it the react way I'd really
58:03 - love to get it working like that um so
58:06 - probably I can do it like I think I can
58:08 - do it the react way with um with masonry
58:13 - uh I can like import it probably what I
58:16 - should do is like install it with npm
58:18 - and then import it into uh my component
58:22 - uh and then set things up like that so I
58:23 - think I could do it in a more react
58:25 - friendly way than I'm doing it right now
58:28 - but it's not
58:30 - like it's not terrible right now I think
58:32 - it's going to work uh we just
58:38 - don't okay Sebastian says it's kind of
58:41 - pointless to make another live stream
58:42 - just to add that onclick thing so um the
58:46 - git link for this project is in the
58:48 - description for this
58:53 - video
58:56 - romatic says can bring back the masonry
58:59 - component add filter prop to the
59:01 - internal State update filter value after
59:03 - clicking on the tabs and you could use
59:05 - something like string match inside the
59:06 - filter all right I'm definitely going to
59:09 - check that out and take a look at it I
59:11 - got to go to my meeting right now though
59:13 - uh thanks for
59:14 - watching and uh I'll be back tomorrow 2
59:22 - P.M
