00:05 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:07 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today we were
00:10 - going to do some work with jQuery it's
00:13 - been a while since we've done anything
00:14 - with jQuery but I built a single page
00:18 - application 2016 I worked on it for on
00:23 - and off for the majority of 2016 I think
00:27 - I launched it in October September
00:30 - something like that yeah it had to have
00:34 - been October I think I launched it right
00:37 - around when my youngest daughter was
00:40 - born so she was born at the beginning of
00:43 - October hey everyone
00:46 - see a lot of you the live chat so before
00:51 - we do that I have a few things I want to
00:54 - talk about I'm gonna try to keep it
00:55 - quick and then we can talk more about it
00:57 - later on when we do the question and
01:00 - answer session so first thing is
01:02 - something cool I found this in my
01:06 - basement and this is like my first phone
01:11 - the first one I ever had so it's one of
01:15 - these old Nokia phones with like the
01:20 - clear case that I thought was so awesome
01:22 - I mean it I still think it's awesome you
01:25 - see all the insides and the buttons are
01:29 - worn down you can't see the numbers on
01:31 - some of them so anyway I'm gonna add
01:33 - this to my antique collection which you
01:36 - all can't see so up here so this is my
01:40 - antique collection up here I just have a
01:43 - bunch of like floppy disk beta tapes the
01:48 - copy of Windows XP and I you can't see
01:52 - it but I have an old like CRT like
01:56 - television with a VCR and it so so
02:00 - that's going to be added to the
02:02 - collection and I'm gonna see if I can
02:07 - find a cord that will charge that and
02:09 - I'll get back on it
02:10 - maybe I can look at all my old text
02:12 - messages and see what I was saying when
02:16 - I was a teenager maybe I'll play some
02:18 - snake y'all remember snake all right so
02:24 - that was that was something fun now
02:28 - something serious and then I want to
02:30 - talk about a project that I'm working on
02:32 - and see if anyone's interested in being
02:34 - involved so something serious I know
02:37 - I've talked on the stream before about
02:39 - mental health issues with myself having
02:43 - depression so I just want to like fill
02:48 - you in on what I've been doing and I've
02:51 - been in a much better mood recently so
02:53 - as you may or may not know from previous
02:55 - streams I am going to counseling every
02:57 - month I'm on in two different
03:00 - antidepressants so I'm doing you know
03:04 - basically medically what I should be
03:06 - doing but then in addition to that this
03:09 - is now the tenth day in a row that I
03:11 - have got up early before work and
03:14 - exercise
03:15 - so nothing intense I just go on an
03:18 - exercise bike while I play Zelda on my
03:22 - Nintendo switch and I just go for like
03:26 - half hour 45 minutes just as long as I
03:30 - can before the kids wake up and and then
03:33 - afterwards I may do some push-ups or
03:35 - sit-ups if I have time and do a little
03:38 - stretching and I'm not super tired
03:43 - during the day I mean I stay caffeinated
03:45 - right so but I'm not really tired from
03:50 - waking up like this morning I got up at
03:52 - 4:45 a.m. and I feel fine right now so
03:56 - anyway I just want to share that with
03:58 - you all I know it's pretty common
04:01 - knowledge that exercise helps with your
04:03 - mood and with depression but sometimes
04:06 - it just takes a little push to get going
04:08 - so this is kind of my little push to say
04:11 - hey I've been doing enough for 10 days I
04:14 - feel a whole lot better it was really
04:16 - really hard at first to get out of bed
04:19 - but now that I got into a rhythm I'm
04:22 - waking up early before my alarm
04:24 - the key also is getting the bed on time
04:27 - so I've been taking melatonin at night
04:30 - so that I can go to sleep early enough
04:33 - to make that possible I'm still not
04:35 - sleeping like a lot like seven hours or
04:38 - so like give or take a half hour but you
04:44 - know if I can get eight that's awesome
04:46 - too but anyway so that's just decide
04:50 - bring that up I haven't really talked
04:51 - about mental health issues on the stream
04:53 - for a while and I know you know some of
04:56 - you may be dealing with the same things
04:59 - it's pretty common so just just want to
05:02 - talk about if anyone wants to talk more
05:03 - about that either in the chat or
05:05 - privately you know feel free to reach
05:08 - out to me I've been dealing with it for
05:10 - a long time and sometimes it does help
05:13 - to be able to talk to somebody who's
05:14 - going through the same thing alright so
05:18 - last thing before we get started with
05:20 - the code as you all know if you've been
05:25 - watching the last few streams I
05:27 - purchased the domain name JavaScript AF
05:30 - and we have a forum running on there now
05:34 - that Harshit set up which is awesome
05:36 - thank you harsh it right now
05:39 - it was down because we were trying to
05:43 - transfer it from harsh it's digitalocean
05:45 - account to mine and took a snapshot try
05:51 - to transfer it didn't work so he just
05:53 - sent me another snapshot and we're gonna
05:58 - try to get that up and running so okay I
06:01 - see this hard should I see the snapshot
06:03 - now thank you I guess I'll just get that
06:05 - up and running after the stream so we're
06:09 - going to try to get that up so if you're
06:12 - trying to get to the forum don't worry
06:14 - it's we're working on it it should be up
06:17 - soon after the stream but I've had so
06:24 - javascript err so you can see job it's
06:27 - in the live chat right now Jay
06:29 - s-see RP or JV SC rptr so I'm just gonna
06:37 - say JavaScript I reached out to me on
06:41 - Instagram and had an idea for a website
06:48 - where developers can connect with
06:50 - developers and it would be like like a
06:53 - social media platform but you'd login
06:56 - with your github profile and it could
06:58 - you could voluntarily have a pool data
07:01 - from your github and mix that in so I I
07:08 - kind of envisioned it and and JavaScript
07:11 - you can let you know you know more
07:14 - details as well in terms of like the UI
07:18 - and things and what's going on but the
07:24 - way I envisioned it is it's gonna be
07:28 - place pretty much just for developers
07:30 - right you have to at least have a github
07:31 - account to get in so if if you don't
07:35 - remember Facebook when it first started
07:38 - around like 2004 somewhere around there
07:42 - you had to have a university email and
07:45 - at first like you had to have your
07:47 - university signed up to get an email not
07:49 - not every university was even allowed
07:51 - yet so it was like this niche and it was
07:56 - kind of cool you you had this thing in
07:58 - common so trying to go for that vibe of
08:02 - you know this is a place just for a
08:04 - certain niche so it's it's not we're not
08:07 - trying to recreate Facebook here or
08:09 - Twitter or anything like that they all
08:11 - serve their purpose and what we're
08:14 - trying to do here is just have a place
08:16 - more geared toward developers so the
08:18 - features would be developers for
08:20 - developers for instance like all the
08:22 - github info I think it would be cool I
08:25 - had another suggestion for someone on
08:27 - Twitter and I'm really sorry I can't
08:29 - remember who it was right now but
08:31 - another suggestion was to feature really
08:34 - awesome JavaScript projects from the
08:36 - community so I think that's another
08:39 - thing that we could work in so that made
08:42 - when you go there it's not all about
08:43 - it's not just all about your feed like
08:46 - Facebook or Twitter is there's also like
08:49 - some highlights from the community of
08:52 - really cool things going on maybe some
08:54 - sort of like voting mechanism to be able
08:56 - to see what's what's going in there and
08:58 - and I would I kind of want to exclude
09:00 - like the really big projects everybody
09:03 - knows reacts a big deal you know so we
09:06 - wouldn't want to feature that because
09:07 - I'm sure it would be on top all the time
09:09 - right when you go to look at like github
09:12 - like top projects it's always a lot of
09:15 - the same really big ones so I would kind
09:17 - of want to feature like some more
09:19 - unknown things that are really cool like
09:21 - people doing like VR with JavaScript
09:23 - machine learning like no bus cool stuff
09:26 - so anyway we don't need to have all the
09:33 - features ready right away of course
09:35 - right but the basic features that we'd
09:38 - like to have are you know obviously this
09:41 - is going to be built with react because
09:42 - that's that's what we've been into new
09:45 - most often in terms of back-end I'm kind
09:49 - of thinking maybe firebase would be a
09:51 - good fit for authentication and things
09:55 - like that so I don't know let me know
09:58 - what you all think so while you're
10:00 - watching the rest of the stream before
10:02 - we get to the question answer session
10:03 - just think about this think if it's
10:06 - maybe something that you'd like to be
10:08 - involved in in some way or you know what
10:13 - are your ideas in terms of technology
10:15 - was what would work best to have
10:18 - something like this where users sign in
10:20 - with their github obviously they're
10:22 - going to need to be data to stored
10:23 - images stored these things so it if
10:27 - you're familiar with firebase let me
10:29 - know if I'm on the right track here in
10:30 - firebase would be a good fit so
10:39 - I yeah I don't know so this is it's
10:42 - still very open in terms of like
10:44 - architecture like what's what we're
10:47 - gonna already use so I mean something
10:50 - like firebase just comes with so many
10:52 - things built in to help us expand so
10:55 - that's why I'm kind of mentioning that
10:56 - but I haven't worked with it personally
10:58 - I've just kind of watched videos on it
10:59 - all right so anyway right now JavaScript
11:05 - er is working on UI stuff so basically
11:07 - just making kind of an interactive
11:09 - prototype with just straight HTML like
11:13 - CSS stuff well eventually once we get
11:16 - that to where like we like it we can
11:19 - convert it to react components so that's
11:24 - that's where we're going now
11:26 - javascript ER has a repo for the UI up
11:30 - now so I guess we could share info about
11:34 - that I'll maybe I'll get a repo going
11:39 - for like the react version of it and so
11:43 - we could have like one official place we
11:46 - can maybe do some have some issues ready
11:48 - if you want to help with it so I am I'm
11:53 - going to kind of stop the conversation
11:54 - on it now so we can get to the get to
11:58 - the code but then we'll pick up with it
12:01 - and you know so feel free to type
12:04 - whatever you think about this project
12:06 - and please be honest if you think it's a
12:08 - terrible idea let me know if you if you
12:10 - have ideas for features or whatever
12:12 - please let me know and we can discuss it
12:15 - in the question answer session I'm
12:19 - probably not going to talk about it all
12:21 - the time on the stream for two reasons
12:23 - one this is free code camp stream we
12:27 - mainly deal with nonprofits this could
12:29 - eventually end up being a for-profit
12:31 - thing if it's big I could see maybe
12:35 - companies wanting to advertise jobs I
12:37 - wouldn't want it to get crazy like a lot
12:41 - of social media now there's so many
12:42 - sponsored posts and things I don't want
12:43 - it to be like that but you know
12:46 - potentially there could be something
12:47 - like some something at some point so I
12:51 - don't want to bring that into the
12:53 - we can't Channel also I am streaming
12:55 - from work and I'd like to work on my
12:57 - work project so I don't want to spend a
13:00 - lot of my work time doing this so if you
13:04 - have questions please feel free to ask
13:05 - me I'll take a minute or two in the live
13:07 - chat everyday to talk if you have a
13:09 - question otherwise just you know send me
13:12 - a message on any of the social media
13:13 - things or whatever and we can kind of
13:15 - organize this and and get this going
13:18 - okay
13:22 - also javascript is in the live chat now
13:24 - so if you want to keep the conversation
13:25 - going just send a message
13:29 - you know just tag JavaScript or in the
13:31 - live chat okay all right so let me
13:38 - introduce you to this old jQuery project
13:41 - that I that I built so I we we worked a
13:46 - little bit on a react version of this
13:48 - project this is the the bulletin right
13:50 - the university of oulu team that we had
13:53 - worked on and i did some updates to it
13:56 - yesterday i added so we had that email
14:00 - authentication where you could do the
14:01 - password list link sent to your email
14:04 - i've added another way to go into the
14:06 - app and we talked about this yesterday a
14:08 - bit where basically if you're able to
14:11 - log into the university single sign-on
14:13 - system and get to that password
14:15 - protected area and then you click the
14:17 - link from there you can get directly
14:20 - into the bulletin without having to go
14:22 - through the normal login process but the
14:26 - problem now is before we automatically
14:30 - had a user's email because they had to
14:31 - put their email in to login and so I had
14:34 - a form on there that a user could fill
14:36 - out and I didn't have an email field
14:38 - because we just grabbed the email
14:40 - automatically now we need to add an
14:42 - email field in and we need to change up
14:46 - a little bit about how we're sending
14:47 - that data to make sure that the emails
14:51 - are going where they they need to go so
14:54 - let's dig into there let's let's kind of
14:57 - like try to straighten out my spaghetti
14:59 - code jQuery this hopefully will be a
15:03 - good example of why you
15:05 - I really don't want to try to make a
15:06 - single-page app and handle routing and
15:08 - everything with jQuery because it starts
15:11 - out small and then you add new features
15:13 - in all the sudden there's a lot there so
15:18 - let's start out and let's run this so
15:21 - this is running on gulp so haven't used
15:24 - go up in a while I don't know how many
15:28 - of you remember using gulp or still use
15:30 - go I mean if I'm not doing the react
15:32 - projects I'd probably go with gulp or
15:35 - maybe just like NPM scripts or something
15:38 - but so I think it's gulp watch let's see
15:44 - oops let me bring my screen up here
15:48 - there we are
15:53 - yeah so I just did a gulp watch and this
16:00 - brought up our bulletin now I'm gonna
16:03 - have to login so here's the the normal
16:07 - login
16:18 - and this is done with a service called
16:21 - auth0
16:23 - so I'm just using the free plan for
16:26 - auth0
16:26 - the university is not very big so the
16:28 - free plan is sufficient and I'm sending
16:31 - the emails for the authentication
16:32 - through SendGrid
16:33 - so the free plan on Austria and SendGrid
16:36 - are kind of what's behind this current
16:38 - system eventually we'll get rid of this
16:42 - system when we switch over to the react
16:45 - version that heart should set up a
16:48 - password the system without the use of
16:52 - Ozzy row which is awesome so let me
16:57 - check my email now and get the code
17:00 - there we go
17:12 - that's great all right so now I'm in so
17:17 - what's happened is the user information
17:19 - is not saved in local storage in the
17:21 - browser so as long as I don't clear your
17:23 - local storage then this will stay login
17:29 - for a year at least that's the plan some
17:32 - users have been having issues where
17:34 - their local storage is getting cleared
17:36 - and there's no apparent reason why so
17:40 - that was the other day there yesterday
17:44 - or the day before or I think I had
17:46 - someone come in for some troubleshooting
17:49 - and that was exactly the issue they were
17:52 - getting logged out and we could not
17:55 - figure out why all right so let's go to
18:02 - this submit announcement form so this is
18:04 - what we're going to be changing we just
18:06 - need to add one more field and that's
18:08 - for email and we probably could now that
18:17 - I look at it you I was it might make
18:20 - more sense visually to move this file up
18:24 - load up here in this corner so we would
18:29 - have email the file upload and then the
18:32 - announcement full-width down here write
18:35 - the announcement generally tends to be a
18:36 - lot longer it wouldn't make sense that
18:39 - will fool with email except on on small
18:43 - screens all right so that's what we're
18:45 - that's what we're gonna do so let's
18:49 - check the code and let me just duplicate
18:54 - this tab and we're gonna go into visual
18:57 - studio code I don't think I have this
19:00 - open anywhere maybe I did oh well okay
19:06 - so this was our password we don't need
19:12 - this this is where I'm handling the
19:14 - login our app
19:19 - [Music]
19:20 - baliya so all the code is informs AAS
19:26 - now unfortunately this code is in a
19:29 - private repo so you won't be able to to
19:33 - follow along I just saw the live chat
19:35 - Harshit said has to go because something
19:38 - came up
19:39 - thanks so much are for for all your
19:42 - help with the forum earlier and
19:44 - hopefully everything's alright nikki has
19:51 - to go to see it thanks for watching
19:55 - let's I also should mention we had some
20:01 - more pool requests come in and we will
20:03 - go over that and review that probably
20:08 - tomorrow I'd like to get back to our
20:10 - main project that francisc and main
20:13 - website that we've been working on
20:15 - tomorrow and then continue to just work
20:18 - on that project until we launch it in
20:20 - February late February
20:24 - alright so let's check out what we have
20:26 - this controls the modal and we have
20:32 - different models that show up whether
20:33 - the message is successful or not we're
20:37 - also going to need to go to the index
20:39 - page so let me split this this screen so
20:47 - we can have the HTML on one place and I
20:54 - believe it's all the way at the bottom
20:55 - here
21:03 - here we are let me know if that font is
21:10 - too small so we can see we have this
21:15 - this text area for announcement what we
21:20 - want to do is make an input so I'm going
21:26 - to I'm gonna take this and copy it and
21:35 - we're gonna need yeah we're gonna need
21:43 - to rearrange this a bit but first how
21:47 - that indentation is crazy there we are
21:55 - so we're get definitely going to change
21:58 - this we don't want the the edit icon so
22:03 - let's see I'm not sure if there's an
22:07 - icon called email but it's worth a shot
22:10 - and we want to change this we obviously
22:12 - don't need a text area so let's change
22:15 - this to an input and we can give it a
22:17 - type of email we want to change the ID
22:27 - to email and he relies inputs I think
22:34 - that class will be fine and we want to
22:38 - change this to an input and the label
22:45 - now is going to be for email and we're
22:53 - going to change this to email all right
22:58 - so now we're pulling in email are we we
23:00 - have a field for email and let's bring
23:03 - up this file upload whoops and you know
23:06 - what I forgot to put this in its own
23:12 - I mess this up a bit alright let's bring
23:16 - this down here and let's put it in a div
23:20 - we are using materialized CSS so that's
23:25 - where these column classes are coming
23:27 - from class it's so weird to not type
23:33 - class name since we're used to doing
23:35 - react but we can use class and let's
23:40 - call let's make this a column and we
23:43 - want it to be in small screens we want
23:45 - to make it full width so 12 out of 12
23:47 - columns and then on medium screens and
23:49 - up we want it to be half the width so 6
23:54 - out of 12 columns and now we can paste
24:00 - in our new input and then we also want
24:06 - to bring in this file upload input so
24:14 - let's grab make sure it'll grab too much
24:19 - class for every checkbox okay I believe
24:23 - we have everything and we're gonna put
24:30 - this right here underneath and we're
24:35 - gonna also need to change our column
24:38 - classes as well so we had the column
24:44 - that was oops
24:51 - did I put this in the wrong spot I think
24:55 - I did
25:05 - let's move that okay
25:13 - now in the right spot so we just need to
25:16 - add on on medium screen so we want this
25:19 - to take up half the width all right now
25:24 - let's check out how this looks and then
25:26 - we can go back to our our code
25:30 - let's move this around so you don't want
25:34 - to go too far all right let's check this
25:38 - all right okay not not too bad
25:42 - so we have our email and you know what
25:46 - the this is not aligned correctly we
25:53 - have to check on this alignment why
25:54 - we're having an issue here but other
25:58 - than the alignment issue this looks fine
25:59 - I do want to make sure we're setting a
26:02 - good breakpoint here so let's see if at
26:05 - any point it looks too small I think
26:08 - it's fine I mean it's getting a little
26:10 - narrow there but that's that's still
26:14 - reasonable all right all right not bad
26:23 - let's see if we can figure out from the
26:26 - markup with this this issue is beat with
26:32 - the spacing with these icons and an easy
26:38 - fix if we can't figure it out would just
26:40 - be to remove the icons which I'm okay
26:45 - with doing that basically the reason
26:47 - being this is a really low level update
26:49 - that needs to happen so I am I'm not
26:56 - that worried about you whether or not
27:00 - there's an icon there all right
27:05 - so we have this row and everything is
27:12 - wrapped in one row okay call them class
27:19 - the field callers - okay it's a column
27:23 - you know what let's try to put though we
27:26 - do have this oops
27:29 - what did we do you know what I added
27:32 - another column there I did not even
27:35 - realize that I added an extra column
27:43 - alright so if anybody caught that and
27:46 - was really confused that's why I added
27:49 - an extra column where I didn't really
27:51 - need one
27:52 - let's check this up now hopefully that
27:55 - corrected it yep and that corrected it
27:57 - now these are lined up properly I'm not
28:04 - thrilled about how far up this is with
28:07 - the email but I'm willing to live with
28:09 - it right now whoa hahaha I didn't even
28:14 - notice this alright I probably just
28:16 - forgot an ending div here somewhere so
28:18 - let's check out our divs
28:21 - [Music]
28:24 - oops there we are I have too many divs
28:34 - here we are
28:39 - all right that's acceptable I'm honestly
28:44 - this is not the best-looking thing I've
28:46 - ever built but right now this needs to
28:50 - be done like today like this morning it
28:54 - needs to be done so I'm okay with it
28:57 - also the fact that we're going to
28:59 - replace this entire thing with something
29:01 - new
29:01 - sometime within the next six months like
29:05 - I'm alright with with this this is a
29:07 - feature used by I don't know maybe a
29:10 - dozen people on campus so it just
29:14 - doesn't make sense to spend a whole lot
29:15 - of time nitpicking the details of this
29:18 - UI alright so now let's make sure that
29:22 - that email gets in to our forms J s file
29:28 - so let's see how how we're getting this
29:33 - data so we can move this over because we
29:38 - won't really need this just mark up for
29:43 - a little while let me see I'm gonna
29:46 - check my time in about five minutes I'm
29:49 - gonna take a five-minute break and I'm
29:52 - gonna go to the live shot here and
29:54 - answer some questions I don't want to
29:56 - get too far behind with the live chat so
29:58 - if you're asking questions you're
29:59 - wondering why I'm not reading your
30:01 - comments or questions
30:03 - I usually go back and forth between code
30:06 - and questions for a certain amount of
30:08 - time so I do code for about 25 minutes
30:09 - then I go back to the question and then
30:12 - at the end I'll just do a big question
30:15 - answer session and get through
30:16 - everything so if you can just hold on
30:19 - and you'll hang out in a live chat I'll
30:21 - get your question if you can't stick
30:23 - around you can always catch the
30:24 - recording of this later on and I'll
30:27 - answer your question you know whether
30:30 - you're here or not and and then it'll be
30:34 - recorded for you to to check out
30:38 - whenever you have time alright so let's
30:41 - see so a little bit about what's going
30:44 - on here maybe if you're not that
30:45 - familiar with jQuery this looks weird if
30:47 - you are familiar with jQuery this is
30:49 - pretty standard so we're just kidding
30:53 - so we're binding the submit event of our
30:56 - form so this is the idea is the
31:00 - announcement submit form and on click
31:04 - we're going to do something so we've
31:07 - passed in the events we have access to
31:08 - that the first thing we're going to do
31:12 - is check the length of our hidden
31:13 - checkbox so this is our security on the
31:16 - form right so I don't even know if this
31:23 - still works anymore but the idea at one
31:24 - point was like if a bot is trying to
31:27 - fill out your form like a spam bot then
31:30 - they they would check the hidden
31:33 - checkbox because they would see it in
31:35 - the markup but a real person would never
31:36 - see it and check it so so if the hidden
31:40 - checkbox is checked then you don't
31:43 - actually send the data right so that's
31:46 - where we're checking there so first
31:51 - thing we're if there's a request going
31:53 - we abort that request and oh man I'm
31:59 - seeing lots of variables here instead of
32:01 - constants Wow so here's our form
32:07 - container and we're just saving that to
32:09 - a variable so from now on dollar sign
32:12 - form is our form and we don't have to
32:14 - keep writing this selector anymore so
32:18 - we're going to get the inputs from form
32:21 - so we're finding all the possible inputs
32:23 - in that form so we're getting any
32:25 - element that is an input a select a
32:29 - button or a text area and then we're
32:33 - initializing some variables here for
32:35 - name value and iterator and then a
32:38 - checkbox we're grabbing the form
32:44 - elements let's see find on input type
32:48 - checkbox' all right so this is getting
32:53 - inputs but we're excluding some things
32:56 - we're excluding checkboxes we don't want
32:58 - the hidden one we're excluding the file
33:02 - type input and we're also grabbing
33:04 - uploads
33:06 - like remembering this as I go along so
33:09 - and remember it was nearly two years ago
33:14 - that I wrote this so be kind as you look
33:19 - upon my spaghetti code alright so we're
33:23 - going to serialize the data and so
33:30 - here's what we need to change right now
33:32 - we're checking local stores the profile
33:34 - that we have saved after someone logs in
33:36 - for the email we don't want to do that
33:39 - anymore
33:40 - we want to grab the email from that form
33:44 - data all right so let's see what the
33:51 - best way would be to change this we are
34:25 - okay I forgot I'm sending this all to a
34:28 - Google sheet and then from there from
34:35 - the Google sheet the email is being sent
34:38 - okay so I don't actually have any code
34:41 - that handles emails all right sometimes
34:51 - it helps to just look at your code even
34:53 - if you wrote it all right I gotta take a
35:00 - break for just a second because it is
35:03 - super hot in my office I'm gonna take
35:05 - off my sweater and then get back to it
35:07 - actually it's a bin all right it's been
35:10 - five minutes so I'm gonna take on my
35:11 - sweater and then we're going to I'm
35:14 - gonna go to the live chat answer some
35:15 - questions read some comments and then
35:17 - we'll come back and we'll grab that
35:19 - email from our new email input and that
35:26 - should be it
35:27 - there's one other place in the bulletin
35:29 - where there's a typo
35:31 - so maybe we can find that and fix it and
35:34 - then we can push all this to production
35:37 - and hope hopefully it all works all
35:43 - right I'm gonna scroll all the way to
35:44 - the top of the live chat sorry if I seem
35:49 - a little bit distracted for some reason
35:51 - like all these songs that I don't like
35:53 - keep playing on Spotify it's just
35:56 - bothering they think and then I keep
35:59 - switching them maybe I should just
36:02 - switch playlists
36:11 - alright there we are switch playing this
36:13 - should be a lot better all right rook or
36:19 - Nicki says old-school app made in 2016
36:22 - sounds about right front end moves so
36:23 - quickly
36:24 - yeah for sure see it's a lot of you
36:32 - saying hi I'm just I'm just to
36:34 - collectively say hi to everyone there's
36:36 - a lot of people in here
36:41 - they're nice that's crazy so old haven
36:45 - ich if you're still there I didn't see
36:48 - you at the beginning there but thanks
36:50 - for watching AHA John Hanson says hey
36:58 - all what jQuery Hank it's just kidding
37:13 - all right so Mari Marius let me know if
37:19 - I'm not pronouncing that correctly the
37:20 - Marius says up when the Mario says had
37:25 - depression too and help get out of it
37:28 - through exercise also says I'm so glad
37:30 - you're doing better talking about it
37:31 - it's a good move too too much stigma
37:34 - around discussing depression yeah I do
37:37 - want to say too with depression I've
37:40 - fallen into the trap before of thinking
37:43 - like hey I'm cured of depression and
37:44 - like stopping my medication and just
37:46 - stopping doing all these things that
37:48 - helped me and then I would fall back
37:51 - into it and it would take me a long time
37:53 - to get back out of it and you know get
37:55 - back to you know doing the things that
37:58 - helped me out so I'm gonna try my best
38:00 - not to fall into that again I'm gonna
38:02 - continue with my counseling my
38:03 - medication my exercise to be honest with
38:06 - you the counseling the medication or way
38:08 - easier than exercise for me like taking
38:10 - a pill not a big deal
38:11 - I'm going to go talk to somebody for you
38:14 - know an hour a month not really a big
38:16 - deal
38:17 - my counsellor is great I always feel
38:19 - like a million bucks after I leave
38:21 - counselling so the exercise would be the
38:25 - hardest but I just want to let you all
38:27 - know that that for me at least
38:29 - depression has never been a thing that I
38:31 - could just like say wow I'm cured it's
38:33 - gone it always comes back sometimes it
38:38 - takes longer than others but you know if
38:40 - you're in that place you know don't
38:42 - don't feel bad about I think that's just
38:44 - kind of the nature of some types of
38:47 - depression med asks why did you get
38:53 - depressed in the first place I don't
38:56 - really know you know why it was it's not
38:58 - like an event happened really that made
39:01 - me really depressed it's more like well
39:04 - as far as my doctors say it's more like
39:07 - a chemical imbalance like there's you
39:09 - know serotonin and different things in
39:10 - your brain that regulate your mood and
39:13 - my brain is not producing enough of that
39:15 - and certain things can help you get more
39:17 - like exercise or medications so that's
39:23 - that's where I'm at right now just
39:25 - trying to get back to
39:26 - like normal levels of you know whatever
39:29 - chemicals in my brain I'm supposed to
39:31 - have they're all right hey I have some
39:38 - of you are typing in Russian normally I
39:42 - would put that in Google Translate but
39:45 - I'm gonna go ahead because we just we
39:46 - have so many comments now that I'm not
39:49 - gonna do it right now maybe I'll do it
39:51 - later on though
39:53 - so apologies for that
40:17 - alright it looks like a lot of you
40:20 - thought that it was a really good idea
40:22 - to have that this whole website that
40:27 - we're thinking of doing with JavaScript
40:30 - AF kind of the a place for developers to
40:34 - showcase their work and encourage each
40:36 - other
40:45 - Jordan asked for links to tutorial
40:48 - videos Jordan let me know what tutorial
40:52 - videos you're talking about because I'm
40:54 - not 100% sure maybe I missed something
40:56 - in the chat or maybe I missed something
40:59 - I'm not sure what I was talking about
41:01 - there so let me know if you mean any of
41:04 - the doriel videos that I've done on my
41:06 - channel which I don't have that many
41:08 - videos yet but the link should be in the
41:10 - description to this to this video Oh
41:14 - horseshit I know you're not here anymore
41:16 - hardship but hard said might kill the
41:18 - forum thing it's getting useless I'm I
41:22 - don't I wouldn't kill the forum right
41:25 - away I think it's a good thing and I
41:27 - think I would rather not kill it but
41:30 - maybe move it to a sub-domain and I
41:35 - don't know you won't let me know what
41:38 - would you think but I thought the forum
41:40 - was really cool a cool idea alright so
41:49 - it's been about five minutes I'm going
41:51 - to go back to the code and try to finish
41:53 - this up I'll come back to I left off in
41:55 - the live chat after we finish this I'll
42:02 - see Sebastian's in the stream and I
42:04 - haven't seen Sebastian for a long time
42:05 - so hey Sebastian how's it going
42:07 - welcome back I'm really happy to see you
42:13 - alright so let's see and I just realized
42:18 - I haven't been using the Pomodoro timer
42:20 - so let me bring this over this is the
42:21 - one that I think this is the one Harsha
42:23 - built yeah
42:25 - so let's set this timer that way I don't
42:27 - have to keep watching the clock and
42:30 - let's grab let's see if we can grab our
42:33 - e-mail so we're bringing this data in
42:36 - we're grabbing these inputs and we're
42:40 - finding this funny funny
42:46 - I'm not sure what format we have this in
42:51 - so I want to see I'm gonna do a console
43:00 - log and I want to see what these form
43:05 - elements are let's check it out let's
43:14 - put something in here autofill some
43:18 - stuff and submit and inspect it see what
43:25 - we get
43:25 - dev tools popped up on that other screen
43:29 - and it's this one
43:35 - announcement text email says good let's
43:42 - make sure I don't have any more console
43:43 - logs in here it's possible console
43:46 - logging several things what one of 19
43:52 - I seriously have 19 console logs whoa
44:00 - all right let's get rid of a lot of
44:04 - these console logs what was I thinking
44:07 - 19 console logs all right I'm okay with
44:10 - with console logging this stuff for now
44:16 - all right I have some well I have a lot
44:20 - of stuff that's just commented out
44:29 - it's always crazy to go back and look at
44:31 - my old coat and just say what was I
44:33 - thinking
44:37 - all right so let's go
44:56 - I want to make sure I know which
45:00 - console.log this is so this is some es6
45:05 - template literal syntax so I use those
45:07 - back ticks and then everything in here
45:09 - is a string unless I put it in with
45:12 - within brackets starting with the dollar
45:14 - sign and then this is JavaScript so now
45:19 - I'll save that and I'm gonna bring this
45:22 - over here make it bigger so it's
45:24 - actually readable for you all let's
45:27 - clear this out and now I'll put my email
45:34 - back in and submit the air we are
45:37 - sisters look at this object object okay
45:39 - cool so we have an object alright I was
45:41 - hoping that we would have an object
45:44 - wonderful alright let's go over here so
45:49 - what I should be able to do is just grab
45:55 - that value let's get rid of this
46:21 - when we get that email oh I see
46:32 - so we are
46:46 - let's take this out of here so we're
46:52 - just going to define email here so it's
46:54 - still available in the scope that we
46:57 - need it but then within this function
47:01 - where we're serializing then I'm going
47:05 - to go here and say if name equals oops I
47:20 - need parentheses so if name equals email
47:34 - then we're going to set email equal to
47:43 - the value all right so now since we
47:50 - defined email here even though we're
47:53 - inside this this loop here we're gonna
47:58 - give email this value and then now we
48:03 - don't have to change anything else
48:05 - because anywhere that we're using the
48:07 - email variable down here it's just gonna
48:11 - pull this value so could we possibly
48:14 - refactor and make it a little bit nicer
48:20 - probably but as I said a few minutes ago
48:24 - this this particular update does not
48:27 - justify spending any more time than we
48:29 - absolutely have to and we're going to
48:31 - replace all the code sometime within the
48:35 - next a few months or so okay so now
48:39 - let's try it out
48:53 - so I'm submitting it it says it's been
48:56 - since although the result says error
48:59 - email invalid email I should let's clear
49:04 - it and then try it again
49:05 - I I'm not sure if that was from this
49:07 - time or the last time
49:17 - all right so in I'm getting an error and
49:21 - a success well the only way to be sure
49:23 - is to check my email
49:25 - so I do got my email open on my other
49:26 - screen and let's see where I should be
49:30 - getting an email at my gmail account and
49:34 - another email at my work account okay
49:42 - all right so we have an issue so right
49:47 - now it's coming through the message is
49:49 - coming through as test but the email is
49:52 - coming through is undefined so let's see
49:56 - what value were actually getting here
49:59 - now there's two ways that we could
50:01 - troubleshoot this right there's multiple
50:03 - ways so we could go in dev tools and
50:05 - check out the value of this or we could
50:07 - console.log console.log would probably
50:10 - be faster at this point but I would like
50:13 - to show you another way that we could we
50:16 - could get this so I don't usually do it
50:18 - this way but it is it can be really
50:24 - useful so let's check out our sources
50:27 - and Wow so many things well how do I
50:38 - have so many sources you know these are
50:45 - all my there we are
50:50 - alright so let's go to our forms and
50:52 - let's check out email so let's put in
51:03 - break right there so let's redo this and
51:09 - now we're gonna go to submit
51:13 - announcement and we'll put the email in
51:15 - or submit and we have a break point now
51:18 - right so I've added the break point so
51:21 - the code stops right here
51:26 - and I can check it says all right the
51:35 - email name equals no space
51:58 - all right so this looks kind of weird
52:02 - our serialized form elements end up
52:05 - being email equals Jessie why go at
52:13 - gmail.com and undefined equals and
52:18 - announcements that so we're doing
52:21 - something wrong let's figure out what
52:23 - we're doing wrong here where are we
52:30 - getting that undefined from
52:49 - you know what I believe we're adding we
52:55 - do need to do some stuff down here I
52:57 - think yeah we do all right let's go back
53:01 - to the code I was a little bit let's see
53:14 - all right
53:15 - King Darcy's one of C's my mistake
53:20 - hahaha good look good look at that
53:24 - good catch those equals all right thank
53:33 - you for catching that you all are great
53:35 - on that you always catch it before me so
53:38 - yeah I was using a comparison instead of
53:42 - assignment right so I was using the
53:44 - three equal signs instead of one so
53:47 - that's that's good but then I also
53:51 - remembered that with the serialized data
54:14 - why am i serializing the form elements
54:17 - and then making the serialized data am I
54:21 - even using the serialize form elements
54:24 - anymore
54:33 - I want to see what I'm doing with these
54:36 - one two three
54:39 - I'm not even using these all right I'm
54:45 - gonna leave it alone
54:47 - this definitely needs refactored there's
54:49 - stuff I'm not even using and we'll leave
54:52 - it alone but it should it should work
54:56 - all right let's see I think that I
55:01 - pulled this code from another project
55:03 - where I did need this and I just left it
55:08 - in there never took it out
55:22 - let's see
55:29 - all right when you refresh it should
55:35 - have refreshed I don't know what oh let
55:37 - me take this up and let me make sure I
55:41 - saved it there we are
55:45 - now let's give it another try
55:53 - all right yay all right wonderful I've
56:04 - received the confirmation so I received
56:07 - a notification at my work email that
56:10 - someone submitted a bulletin and then I
56:12 - received a notification at my personal
56:15 - email that my submission was received
56:19 - awesome very awesome
56:23 - all right cool okay so it works so the
56:29 - let's let me check my timer whoops all
56:35 - right so I have about ten minutes left
56:36 - at this point I want to very quickly
56:39 - find the typos that I had which a
56:42 - co-worker of mine found it so I'm going
56:45 - to go to my slack messages and look at
56:48 - that again
56:56 - okay great
57:05 - on the bulletin help page okay so it's
57:08 - on the help page which listen help I
57:20 - don't even remember what the help page
57:22 - is is it okay it's a separate it's a
57:28 - totally separate page okay let's see
57:32 - hopefully I actually have it in here but
57:36 - it will be suppose the dist index hmm
57:47 - help all right so have a whole nother
57:50 - folder that's for help
57:51 - let's look at the index and see what we
57:56 - can do
57:57 - all right so it says experience is
58:01 - misspelled expe r IE n c e h PE r IE NC
58:12 - all right cool let's just well that's
58:19 - too much let me make sure I'm not using
58:20 - it anywhere else
58:22 - expe o the end all right so that's not
58:28 - coming up at all good alright so that is
58:31 - ready I do have a dist folder let me see
58:39 - strength Inc how I got this help alright
58:42 - so help is included in the dist so I
58:45 - have this set up that I can just use
58:48 - gulp dist to make this ready but the
58:54 - last time I tried to run this it didn't
58:56 - actually do what it needed to do to all
59:00 - the proper file so I'm gonna go into dis
59:02 - now and make sure that we have changes
59:04 - in the proper file so it should be index
59:06 - and then that forms dot J s and we also
59:10 - need to have index dot HTML within help
59:15 - change as well so we're in the dist
59:17 - folder it looks like help did not change
59:19 - so we're gonna I just I'm just going to
59:23 - manually pull this over for now you can
59:26 - see like all the little places where
59:28 - things just did not get it it's just not
59:33 - good there's just little manual things
59:35 - that need to be done the build steps are
59:38 - just aren't good like compare that to
59:40 - something like using create react app
59:42 - and having all that done for you and and
59:47 - it's consistent it's reliable it's just
59:50 - a huge difference alright not that you
59:54 - couldn't do that in an app like this but
59:57 - it's not like it's not like I had an
60:01 - all-in-one like this is going to do
60:03 - everything I wanted to solution
60:05 - alright so that's there we can close up
60:07 - this help and our index dot HTML and I
60:13 - have great okay so check our status just
60:19 - to double-check at this distance
60:22 - awesome now the next step is let's do a
60:26 - commit let's say an email field to Miss
60:40 - submission form and we're gonna push
60:50 - that up to get up so again I apologize
60:53 - this is a private repo so you can't see
60:58 - the changes and then now I'm going to do
61:00 - fly production so I'm using an NPM
61:08 - module called flight plan which
61:12 - basically goes into your server and
61:16 - copies over your files into the right
61:19 - folder and it's really fast so that's it
61:25 - that should be working I'm going to
61:27 - double check
61:28 - by going to the bullets in the live
61:30 - version and actually let me bring this
61:36 - up on my screen
61:37 - No oh let's see all right so it's not
61:43 - working now but this would be a good
61:45 - test so this is the new login system the
61:49 - new possible way to log in that I'm
61:52 - going to test right now I tested it
61:54 - yesterday but can't hurt to test it
61:56 - again so now I've logged into our the
61:59 - university's single sign-on system that
62:01 - they call access fus I clicked
62:03 - University bulletin we just saw a second
62:05 - ago I was not logged in I click that and
62:08 - now I have access to the bulletin but
62:12 - there is no login info saved for me but
62:15 - if I go to submit announcement no no did
62:19 - not go there
62:23 - maybe there's some cat there we go
62:26 - it was just caching all right cool so
62:28 - now I have the email files let's do a
62:32 - live test of this and submit submission
62:40 - has been sent let's check my email to
62:44 - verify yes I just got verifications on
62:49 - Gmail and on my work account wonderful
62:52 - all right cool so everything worked out
62:56 - today maybe I'm better with jQuery than
62:59 - I am with react usually I break
63:02 - something with react oh wow so hopefully
63:06 - I I was trying to do a couple of things
63:09 - with this stream like other than just my
63:11 - normal like watch me at work you know
63:15 - type of thing and that was show an
63:18 - example of how I used to do things and
63:21 - kind of like hopefully see how far I've
63:24 - come and and really not that much time
63:27 - and also show an example of how things
63:30 - can just get really out of control when
63:33 - you try to like hand code everything and
63:36 - not use something like react or angular
63:38 - or your view to structure your
63:42 - it's possible I met all the user
63:44 - requirements with this it works it's
63:47 - reliable but it's it's kind of hard to
63:51 - maintain there's not really that much of
63:52 - a logic to it until I go back in and
63:55 - just look at what I've done so anyway I
64:00 - hopefully that was like somewhat evident
64:03 - to you all hopefully I don't have to go
64:07 - back in and mess with this very for very
64:10 - much longer and we get that react
64:12 - version going so with the time we have
64:17 - left which is only three minutes so I'm
64:20 - not going to do any more code now I'm
64:21 - going to go back to the live chat and
64:23 - I'm going to answer all your questions
64:25 - read out comments and so anything that
64:29 - you want to talk about put it in the
64:30 - live chat let's scroll up okay
64:36 - Zuber says no fireplace please instead
64:39 - use Postgres alright so Zubair if you're
64:43 - still there let me know why you don't
64:46 - think firebase would be a good fit for
64:48 - this Anne Hale says MongoDB we can
64:56 - definitely look into using for
64:59 - sure
65:00 - oh okay hard mate that's right okay
65:05 - so I don't I don't know if our should
65:06 - still here or not the Harsha did make
65:08 - that chat app with firebase so I'm not
65:10 - sure if he shared that with everyone in
65:12 - the live chat but I I remember logging
65:14 - into that before so that's awesome
65:17 - so since Harshit is already familiar
65:19 - with firebase that might be a good way
65:21 - to go though just to save the time of
65:23 - having to learn something else
65:30 - Anoop says horseshit you're pumped up
65:32 - yeah hard should it always has a lot of
65:34 - enthusiasm I really love that about
65:37 - Harshit and he has the skills to back it
65:39 - up so Nicky says firebase is pretty easy
65:50 - to use but apparently gets expensive
65:52 - when your site gets popular all right I
65:56 - can see that but I wonder is it more
66:00 - expensive if your site at really popular
66:04 - is it more expensive to use firebase or
66:06 - would it be more expensive to try to do
66:08 - the same thing by scaling like manually
66:11 - scaling up servers and handling all that
66:15 - so ideally if our site they'd get
66:18 - popular we would either get some funding
66:20 - from investors or donations or let's say
66:25 - advertising or you know probably like
66:28 - job listing types types of things I
66:30 - think a job listing would be the most
66:32 - useful kind of advertising for
66:34 - developers because developers probably
66:39 - are looking for a job or at least would
66:42 - like to see what's out there if we start
66:45 - if we did would do advertisements for
66:47 - products I mean it could possibly be
66:50 - useful but I could see that becoming a
66:52 - little bit I don't kind of more annoying
66:57 - that's just me I don't let me know what
66:59 - you all think
67:05 - on how us if there was a repo of the
67:08 - project that I was talking about and
67:10 - this is that JavaScript AF project we're
67:12 - talking about the beginning I haven't
67:14 - made a repo yet JavaScript there made a
67:17 - repo that's just gonna be like a static
67:20 - HTML site just to kind of get the layout
67:23 - done which i think is a great idea
67:27 - because it at least for me a lot of
67:31 - times a static HTML site is just so much
67:34 - easier to to do things in to make like
67:38 - UI changes you don't really need to add
67:41 - all that other stuff that comes with
67:43 - building out react you don't need you
67:46 - know at that point once we're you know
67:48 - pretty satisfied with the UI then we can
67:51 - always start making that UI in react
67:55 - kind of like how we did for cat a
67:57 - chemical Institute but we're gonna do a
67:59 - better job of it
68:06 - guitar says M lab is free check it out I
68:09 - think we've worked with M lab in the in
68:11 - the past on houses MongoDB Atlas has a
68:18 - free version cool thank you for all the
68:22 - the suggestions here I really appreciate
68:24 - this ambition says do you code on the
68:29 - weekends sometimes it depends I really I
68:34 - try to save the weekends for hanging out
68:36 - with my family but when I was doing the
68:39 - Udacity react nanodegree I I coded on
68:42 - the weekends when I have a client on the
68:44 - side I code on the weekends so it just
68:49 - depends on what's going on right now my
68:51 - wife is doing she she's doing to like
68:56 - boot camp programs at once so she's
68:58 - gonna Udacity nano degree and she was
69:01 - doing the flat iron boot camp at the
69:03 - same time so the weekends like she
69:06 - needed all the time on the weekend to do
69:08 - that she just graduated from Flatirons
69:10 - boot camp so maybe she won't need as
69:15 - much time we'll see so right now I'm
69:18 - doing
69:19 - little Cody on the weekends but that
69:22 - sometimes I do a lot it just depends
69:34 - Zuber asked if javascript err and hard
69:37 -  username used by the same person
69:38 - oh no no it's dude JavaScript and
69:41 - harshin or two different people
69:57 - michael said just got here and i think i
70:00 - really missed the most important part of
70:01 - the chat all right Michael if you're
70:03 - still there I guess just go back and
70:07 - watch their recording I don't sorry I'm
70:15 - gonna need a drink after fit and I can't
70:20 - get rid of mic off it's not nearly as
70:23 - bad as it was the last week but it's
70:27 - like still there let's see I lost my
70:34 - place here
70:53 - Stephen s if if we're gonna cry when we
70:56 - see this meaning my jQuery mess Alexis's
71:05 - jQuery is still used to s go yeah yeah I
71:08 - know it's definitely still still used
71:12 - Stephen says Jessi's confidence level is
71:14 - scaring me today I'm not sure what you
71:19 - made does it seem like I have a lot of
71:21 - confidence today or not a lot of
71:22 - confidence it feels like I'm the normal
71:27 - amount but I don't know and is that a
71:31 - good thing or a bad thing if I'm more or
71:34 - less confident
71:37 - Zuber says think about parcel jazz okay
71:41 - I haven't heard about parcel jazz
71:45 - Siraj says parcel is the new build tools
71:48 - oh okay
71:50 - and Mayer says partially I'm loving
71:52 - alright wow I'm totally like out of the
71:55 - loop here I didn't know that I don't
71:58 - remember parcel Jess at all I'll
72:00 - definitely have to check that up the
72:05 - JavaScript just says if you want to talk
72:06 - more about the project you can DM me on
72:11 - insta yeah me as well you know there's a
72:14 - variety of ways to get in touch with me
72:16 - so whatever way is most comfortable to
72:18 - you you know just let me know
72:20 - email Twitter LinkedIn Facebook one of
72:25 - the Instagram any of the social media
72:27 - stuff I'm on just you know message me
72:44 - all right Michael Chris has defined
72:46 - spaghetti
72:48 - yes so when I say spaghetti code usually
72:52 - it's just like to me I don't know if
72:56 - there's an official definition right
72:58 - like it's it's just kind of like a term
73:01 - that people use to describe code that's
73:05 - kind of like gotten out of control out
73:07 - of order it's it's not separated out
73:10 - logically so that was that's what tends
73:14 - to happen on some projects that were you
73:17 - either and it doesn't you don't have to
73:20 - use jQuery for to turn out a spaghetti
73:22 - code you could be using vanilla
73:24 - JavaScript you custom make everything
73:27 - like the routing and all that which is
73:30 - great and it could be really clean at
73:32 - first when it's small but then you come
73:34 - back in later on and sometimes you have
73:36 - to add a feature here there it doesn't
73:38 - scale well you end up just adding on
73:41 - pieces of code sometimes you don't
73:43 - remove old pieces because you need it
73:46 - for this one thing and then later on you
73:49 - may not need it anymore but you don't
73:51 - remember that you don't need it so like
73:53 - I went back in and found a variable that
73:56 - I I wasn't using at all so evidently
74:00 - when I was working through that I left
74:03 - it in there for a reason and then forgot
74:05 - to take it out so that's kind of what I
74:09 - mean by spaghetti code it's all jumbled
74:11 - up like spaghetti and it's hard to take
74:13 - it apart right it's hard to just take
74:15 - like one strand of spaghetti and
74:17 - separate at all you know with before you
74:20 - had to stick your fork in and do that
74:21 - it's hard so in the same way it's hard
74:23 - to just separate out parts of your code
74:25 - like you could and react right like in
74:28 - react you have your component if you do
74:30 - it right you know you could remove that
74:32 - component and pop it in another project
74:35 - and with minimal changes or sometimes no
74:38 - changes it can work hopefully that makes
74:40 - sense let me know if it doesn't or let
74:43 - me know if I'm wrong about spaghetti
74:44 - code it means something totally
74:45 - different than I think it means
75:09 - see
75:15 - Gander 7 says I watch from work and
75:18 - couldn't pay attention because of Ward
75:20 - discussion when you were pitching an app
75:21 - idea at the beginning could you recap if
75:23 - you figure out what I'm asking
75:26 - yeah sure Gander 7 I mean the best recap
75:30 - is going to be just to watch the the
75:34 - replay but just a very short recap is
75:36 - it's going to be a website where
75:38 - developers can have a profile on there
75:40 - where it'll just you'll sign in with
75:42 - github it can pull data from about your
75:46 - repos and things and you can share
75:47 - projects you're working on and talk with
75:49 - other developers and it could be a place
75:52 - to you know highlight your work I'm kind
75:54 - of hoping that it would end up being a
75:56 - place where the focus is mainly on
76:01 - projects especially maybe smaller more
76:04 - obscure projects that are really cool
76:05 - the people working on to kind of bring
76:07 - it to the community and you know get
76:10 - some more exposure for that and also a
76:12 - place where I mean let's face it like a
76:15 - lot of the other social media places
76:17 - they're all this other stuff aside from
76:20 - coding right so it would be nice to have
76:23 - a place to go where the focus is mainly
76:25 - just you know coding and developer
76:28 - related stuff and not necessarily you
76:31 - know other stuff that's going on in the
76:32 - world there's it's important to talk
76:34 - about other things but sometimes you
76:37 - don't want all that other distraction
76:39 - around so this will like be purposely
76:43 - focused on one group just developers and
76:49 - only on topics that relate to to
76:52 - developers
77:06 - on Hill says we can open an issue with
77:09 - the subject about this project or
77:12 - JavaScript er you can write the
77:14 - description of the project in the readme
77:16 - of the repo yeah that's actually a great
77:18 - idea thanks for that I know we should
77:20 - definitely just explain everything and
77:23 - have it there for everyone to see
77:25 - old sauce says why is jQuery so bad
77:29 - where is where it's best use and where
77:33 - you don't have to use it all right so
77:36 - yeah I guess I don't want to give the
77:39 - impression that jQuery is terrible to
77:41 - use because I think some people it seems
77:45 - like they believe that but I really
77:47 - don't believe that I think jQuery has
77:49 - its place I will say this if you're
77:52 - working with react you should probably
77:54 - not use jQuery because any Dom
77:56 - manipulation with jQuery is going to
77:59 - circumvent reacts you know the component
78:02 - lifecycle so you're not going to get
78:04 - that you're not going to trigger a
78:05 - rerender with within react you really
78:10 - should do everything like that within
78:11 - state so try to avoid it with react but
78:18 - if you had a project that was not react
78:23 - based than you wanted to add some jQuery
78:26 - stuff it could be a very helpful library
78:28 - can help you do more in less time than
78:30 - if you try to do it all which is vanilla
78:32 - JavaScript jQuery can be very helpful
78:35 - especially for beginners we're just
78:38 - trying to get started and get a feel for
78:40 - doing things I mean yes I think we can
78:43 - all agree that learning to do things the
78:45 - vanilla JavaScript way and the long run
78:47 - is very good for a developer but
78:48 - sometimes newer developers need to have
78:51 - some successes and need to be able to
78:54 - build cool things early on to keep their
78:56 - spirits up and to make it through this
78:59 - you know we all know there's ups and
79:01 - downs you gotta have some thing to look
79:03 - back on to say wow I did that to get you
79:06 - through those Downs
79:07 - I think jQuery you can very very quickly
79:11 - be able to make some cool things also
79:15 - you know people talk a lot about how
79:17 - it's bad that jQuery
79:19 - is this big library you bring in and
79:21 - sometimes you only use a tiny piece of
79:22 - that library well the fact is that most
79:26 - sites on the internet use jQuery so the
79:28 - odds that somebody already has that you
79:31 - know cache somewhere especially if you
79:34 - use a CDN are pretty good so the the
79:38 - cost of that size of you know jQuery is
79:43 - really mitigated by that so all in all I
79:46 - I'm not if you use jQuery I'm not at all
79:49 - trying to say you're bad develop or
79:51 - anything
79:51 - obviously I've used a lot of jQuery on
79:54 - projects I even usually carry on a
79:56 - project within the last year that we
79:58 - completed so I will say this in terms of
80:05 - just don't use it if you don't have to
80:08 - if you only need to use a little bit of
80:10 - jQuery it might be worth it to look up
80:12 - how to do it with another JavaScript
80:16 - yeah so that's my take on it if you
80:19 - disagree please let me know in the live
80:22 - chat or if you agree but have something
80:25 - to add to that please let me know
80:36 - see
80:41 - [Music]
80:43 - started
80:56 - then this is hello from Russia hey how's
80:58 - it going thanks for joining us no my AB
81:05 - said is that visual code on Linux on
81:10 - houses Syed yes I use it on the moon too
81:13 - yes it is available on on Linux yeah
81:19 - Dennis wants to see my plugins for
81:21 - Visual Studio code sure let's view
81:26 - extensions alright here's what I have
81:33 - let me get rid of these it's not gonna
81:37 - let me alright so here's what I have now
81:40 - most of these extensions can be added if
81:43 - you just get the react food-truck
81:46 - extension react food-truck will
81:49 - automatically add a bunch of these in
81:51 - but if you do that I highly recommend
81:54 - that you disable import cost because it
82:00 - uses a lot of resources on your machine
82:02 - and it caused me to drop a lot of frames
82:05 - in my streams
82:06 - Harshit said it either crashed or almost
82:09 - crashed his computer so yeah so just be
82:15 - aware of that if you end up getting
82:17 - react food-truck
82:19 - so all I guess I'll just scroll slowly
82:21 - through this and then if you want if you
82:25 - need to pause on one of them just you
82:27 - know what you can pause the video or go
82:29 - back and watch the recording javascript
82:37 - or says I hate depression I suffer from
82:39 - it as well as anxiety yeah yeah for sure
82:43 - the anxiety occasionally I have trouble
82:46 - with anxiety but I've been it's been
82:48 - good I used to have panic attacks but
82:50 - it's been years since I had a panic
82:52 - attack and I really like I'm a lot
82:56 - better with that John Henson says about
83:02 - jQuery the jQuery is not bad though it
83:04 - does not run natively inside a browser
83:05 - therefore a library needs to be running
83:07 - inside
83:08 - browser in order for it to call the
83:09 - JavaScript so there's data overhead that
83:13 - is that's well said so I definitely
83:17 - agree with that his access I went
83:21 - through a two
83:32 - Oh Peter says Visual Studio code is also
83:36 - available on Debian and Red Hat Patrick
83:45 - says Patrick O'Donnell says hey walking
83:48 - 20 minutes a day is all the exercise you
83:50 - probably need it or wonders good luck
83:52 - cool yeah actually I've heard that my
83:55 - wife was telling me that she read that I
83:57 - don't actually need to exercise for that
83:59 - long to get the the mental benefits so
84:03 - I'm gonna keep that in mind
84:06 - but so I made a room for myself that if
84:10 - I'm exercising on the exercise bike I
84:13 - get to play the Nintendo switch so it's
84:18 - incentive for me to play otherwise my
84:20 - kids always want to play and it's like I
84:22 - just don't get to so I kind of want to
84:27 - keep exercising for 45 minutes because
84:30 - you can't get that much done in 20
84:32 - minutes right but anyway I'll keep that
84:37 - in mind because sometimes if I didn't
84:39 - get my full 45 minutes in I would feel
84:41 - bad about it which is I didn't want to
84:43 - feel about I'm exercising so I can feel
84:44 - better so I'll keep in mind that I
84:47 - really don't need that 45 minutes and
84:49 - that's just extra I think you know that
84:51 - that'll mentally that'll be better for
84:53 - me
84:57 - Dennis said I can translate from Russian
84:59 - if you need oh cool cool thank you
85:03 - Blake says why the dot af you know the
85:07 - UM alright I could say okay Michael
85:11 - criolla explain that all right thanks
85:13 - thanks for Michael yeah I just got the
85:19 - domain name is kind of like a joke cuz I
85:22 - thought it would be like it'd just be
85:25 - cool to have I wasn't sure what I would
85:26 - do with it so that's why I got it I just
85:30 - it like I realized that dot AF names
85:34 - were thing and you could actually get it
85:35 - it's the Afghanistan like code so I
85:40 - immediately just started typing things
85:43 - in to see if they were available
85:44 - and JavaScript was one of the first ones
85:46 - I tagged in it was available so I got it
85:51 - JavaScript er says I'm getting a lot of
85:54 - good feedback from it awesome
85:59 - my AB says yep I found a flat pack for
86:03 - Visual Studio code cool I'm not sure I
86:06 - don't know what flat pack does let me
86:09 - know Sebastian says quick TL TL DR so
86:17 - too long didn't read on the JavaScript
86:19 - thing happens haven't been seeing the
86:21 - stream in a while yeah well hopefully
86:30 - you've you're still on and you've heard
86:32 - me explain it a couple times so let me
86:34 - know if you need some more explanation
86:36 - though but I think we've got over - a
86:37 - couple times down
86:49 - Sebastian says hey I've been working
86:51 - hard I have this week off so I'm
86:53 - catching around awesome well enjoy your
86:55 - week off I'm glad you decided to spend
86:57 - some of it here with us Oh
87:05 - Alexi said the chat has been buggy is
87:08 - anyone else having a problem with the
87:09 - chat
87:10 - it seemed okay for me but I wasn't
87:12 - really in it a lot I was on my other
87:15 - screen
87:25 - Sebastian says get a dot tk1
87:28 - it's free and more popular what's the
87:36 - dot tk1 am i missing the the joke with a
87:41 - dot CK domain
87:55 - Aleksey says da da f domains are
87:57 - expensive where can I get that domain
87:59 - cheap
88:00 - I don't really know it was kind of
88:02 - expensive it's more than I've ever paid
88:05 - for a domains oh it was like an impulse
88:09 - buy I was like oh this I just have to do
88:12 - it so I don't I don't know if you can
88:16 - get a cheaper I didn't find it anywhere
88:18 - cheaper Michael says between yesterday's
88:27 - group chat and now today's look at your
88:30 - spaghetti I'm feeling better about the
88:32 - code block I'm experiencing all right
88:35 - well I'm glad I mean I always say this
88:37 - if I want you all to see when I mess
88:42 - things up because I think it is
88:44 - important to see other developers
88:47 - messing things up trying to work through
88:49 - it especially messing up just simple
88:51 - things like I messed up and put three
88:53 - equal signs instead of one equal sign
88:55 - right like especially for developers who
88:59 - work alone or freelance or something
89:01 - like it's easy to get the idea from
89:05 - social media from other YouTube videos
89:08 - that there's all these developers out
89:10 - there that are awesome and the don't
89:11 - make as many mistakes as you do but
89:15 - that's not the case
89:17 - at least I think it's not the case
89:18 - because I make a lot of mistakes show so
89:21 - I just kind of wanted to share that
89:23 - right because we we don't naturally want
89:25 - to show our mistakes right we want to
89:28 - post a selfie online and we take 50
89:29 - selfies and post the best one right we
89:32 - don't post normally all the worst ones
89:34 - right it's the same way with our code
89:36 - right we don't post our terrible code
89:39 - and we don't post to you know talk about
89:43 - how much how the crazy ridiculous simple
89:46 - mistakes we made so anyway my point is
89:50 - that I'm glad that it was working out
89:52 - that way for you Michael
89:57 - Oh Michael said by the way the : in the
90:01 - days remaining give is making my OCD
90:04 - kicking super hard these remaining I
90:07 - don't know where that div is alright let
90:10 - me get rid of these extensions I kind of
90:15 - want to see this this day let's see I
90:25 - don't even know where I have these
90:27 - remaining on here oh whoa
90:29 - let's see I lost my place
90:38 - sorry sometimes the chat just Scrolls
90:42 - down all the way to the bottom
91:01 - King Dhara aha so King Ghidorah kept
91:05 - pointing out my mistake with the equal
91:06 - signs he said I was going crazy over
91:11 - here I know sorry it took me so long to
91:14 - look over I just I always forget that
91:16 - you all probably see it before I do and
91:19 - I should have just looked at the
91:20 - teachers I didn't realize that I had a
91:22 - mistake for a while though anyways david
91:30 - says Jessie you remember our venerable
91:31 - code opulent and imperial gazing proudly
91:34 - from its stoic perch above the page
91:38 - alright that's a different one today
91:40 - David
91:51 - I'm wondering so David is that a quote
91:53 - from something because I don't I don't
91:56 - really know what it's from anyway let me
92:02 - know
92:15 - all right so javascript is made an issue
92:17 - in the github repo on on javascript or
92:21 - github account where we can all discuss
92:24 - the project
92:42 - max put a like a sleeping emoji so I
92:48 - don't know what I was doing at that time
92:50 - in the stream but it must have been
92:51 - boring
92:52 - sorry max King Doris says the reason I'm
92:58 - not a fan of firebase is because it
93:00 - feels dirty to put all of the back-end
93:01 - data management logic in the client does
93:06 - that matter maybe I'm using it wrong
93:09 - I don't really know King Ghidorah
93:12 - I like I said the only thing I've seen
93:14 - about firebase is from YouTube videos I
93:16 - haven't actually used it yet I'm gonna
93:21 - have to talk to some people that have
93:22 - used it I know hard has enough to
93:24 - talk more with hardship and maybe I'll
93:27 - just try to you know reach out to people
93:29 - to see if someone can fill me in on the
93:33 - pros and cons of using it
93:41 - King Doris's and I know firebase
93:44 - functions are a thing but I haven't
93:45 - heard much about them yeah I haven't
93:47 - heard anything about them either
93:49 - Jordan says go server list with AWS yeah
93:54 - I'm like it I'm open for any suggestions
93:56 - on this right now I just threw out
93:58 - firebase kind of to kind of get things
94:00 - started get the discussion started but
94:03 - the way I look at different technologies
94:05 - is you have your user stories you know
94:08 - what you want to accomplish now find the
94:10 - technology that will accomplish that the
94:13 - best way
94:13 - the quickest way the cheapest way what
94:16 - you know whatever you needed to do find
94:19 - what's going to get that done for you so
94:21 - I'm not tied to any one technology it
94:24 - would be nice to use something that I'm
94:26 - familiar with there'd be less learning
94:30 - involved for me I'm not opposed to
94:31 - learning but I just know like I'm
94:33 - realistic with my time to know if you
94:36 - know I might not it might take a lot
94:38 - longer if I have to learn something new
94:40 - before I can help out on this project
94:46 - Michael Chris has no ads please no ads
94:49 - JavaScript er says yeah no ads trust me
94:53 - that Lexi said ads aren't bad take a
94:56 - look at carbonize yeah I I don't want to
95:01 - put ads on there like I said the only
95:03 - thing they even remotely close to ads
95:05 - that I'd be okay with or job postings
95:07 - because to me like that's that's helpful
95:10 - to developers right when you go on Stack
95:13 - Overflow you see the job postings on the
95:15 - side that never annoys me I'm I think
95:18 - it's I'd like to see like oh yeah what
95:21 - jobs are out there what are they asking
95:22 - for what are the titles even if I'm not
95:24 - looking for a job it's still nice to
95:26 - stay up to date on that so that's what
95:30 - I'm talking about
95:30 - I really would like to stay away from
95:32 - ads if possible I mean but all like
95:37 - realistically at some point if it gets
95:39 - really big in the cost for servers and
95:40 - everything is really high something's
95:43 - gonna have to happen it doesn't have to
95:45 - be ads but something needs to happen so
95:47 - that can be paid for I am NOT
95:49 - independently wealthy
95:50 - so either like Bitcoin has to get to a
95:53 - million dollars
95:54 - or I have to win the lottery or we got
95:57 - to find some other way to this before
95:59 - tea
96:09 - michael says the customers who would
96:11 - come to the site have a ad-blockers
96:13 - install so it would be a waste of time
96:15 - to set them up it could be I don't
96:18 - really mind ads that sometimes it's
96:20 - useful if they give me like targeted ads
96:22 - based on my interests sometimes I see it
96:25 - I'm like oh yeah I did want that thing
96:30 - Alexi says I guess it depends on the
96:32 - person I whitelist pages that I want to
96:35 - support
96:35 - I also whitelist youtubers I'll export
96:38 - oh that's a good idea I never thought
96:40 - about that but I don't run an ad blocker
96:43 - on my regular browser I do have it on
96:46 - one of my browsers but that is a really
96:49 - good idea about whitelist things to
96:51 - support the site's you do work I like
96:53 - that Mikael says hi what are you
96:56 - building in this particular stream I was
97:01 - building I was doing some updates on a
97:03 - jQuery single page application that I
97:06 - had built two years ago and I was just
97:09 - adding in a new field to a form and
97:13 - connecting that up with we were sending
97:17 - it to a Google sheet and then that would
97:20 - be emailed from there
97:32 - Oh Mykel creo sorry Michael so I thought
97:37 - Michael had asked me to define spaghetti
97:38 - codes spaghetti code but he actually
97:41 - said definitely spaghetti sorry I went
97:45 - through that whole explanation Michael
97:48 - also says believe me I know what
97:49 - spaghetti code is I have a pasta master
97:52 - so sorry about that Michael well maybe
97:57 - somebody out there didn't know what it
97:58 - was so hopefully that was useful to
98:00 - someone
98:20 - Michael said Jessie developers need
98:23 - their ups and downs to make the ups feel
98:25 - better me you're preaching to the crowd
98:29 - okay so quote quoting me and then he
98:31 - says me you're preaching to the crowd
98:32 - brother yeah I mean yeah that's just how
98:36 - it is that's I think just the nature of
98:38 - it that you you get sometimes you feel
98:42 - amazing you build something really cool
98:44 - you've solved the problem and then other
98:46 - times it's just like you you question
98:48 - your the decisions you've made in life
98:50 - that brought you to this point so I
98:54 - think as you get more experienced as a
98:57 - developer the lows aren't quite so bad
99:01 - I've and the highs are you're more
99:07 - realistic about the highest right so I
99:09 - don't really get to the point anymore
99:10 - I'm like yes I'm awesome like I know
99:13 - everything and I think that's a good
99:15 - thing because I know enough now to know
99:19 - that I'll never know enough right
99:22 - there's always going to be more to learn
99:24 - but I also know enough to know like all
99:28 - right if I totally mess something up or
99:30 - I can't get it to work like that's okay
99:32 - it happens I just need to you know keep
99:36 - working at it or you know ask for help
99:38 - or do something so but I think it's
99:42 - hardest on newer developers you know
99:44 - they don't have as much time to be able
99:49 - to look back on and say yeah I remember
99:50 - that time when I couldn't get this to
99:53 - work and I remember that time when I did
99:54 - this and that was awesome so I don't
100:00 - know anything to help new developers
100:02 - kind of get past that to kind of keep
100:04 - them humble on when they're really up
100:06 - and to keep their spirits up when
100:09 - they're really low I think is a good
100:11 - thing and that's that's probably one of
100:14 - the most important things I think new
100:16 - developers need because there's a wealth
100:18 - of information to help them but like the
100:21 - emotional aspect of it is not it's not
100:25 - as easy to find help with that
100:26 - especially if you're on your own
100:36 - David says I'm learning JavaScript now
100:38 - and still trying to see if I should
100:39 - continue or go to jQuery I think I'm
100:42 - almost at the end of my JavaScript
100:44 - learning David yeah I mean I you don't
100:52 - need to go to jQuery right if you know
100:54 - JavaScript well you can do everything
100:56 - that jQuery can do and just plain
100:58 - vanilla JavaScript there jQuery can just
101:02 - make it will be shorter for you to write
101:05 - even though like technically you're
101:06 - adding in a lot of extra code because
101:08 - you're you have the whole library in but
101:10 - from your perspective which you actually
101:12 - have to write could be less it could be
101:15 - easier to reason about it so it just
101:18 - depends there's a lot of different
101:22 - things you can get into to learn though
101:23 - with with Java scripts besides jQuery it
101:27 - just kind of depends on what you want to
101:28 - do there's so many I mean you can do
101:30 - back-end stuff in JavaScript with node
101:31 - you can do VR stuff with node now you
101:35 - can do machine learning which I love the
101:39 - script
101:40 - I'm not saying javascript is the best
101:42 - way to use machine learning the people
101:44 - have strong opinions about that but is
101:46 - possible you can even do Internet of
101:48 - Things stuff with JavaScript so there's
101:53 - a lot of different ways you could go
101:57 - also says totally review with you Jesse
102:00 - about jQuery good to practice and learn
102:01 - and after that try react see David David
102:09 - says are there things in JavaScript that
102:12 - I simply won't need as a web developer
102:13 - oh yeah absolutely
102:15 - absolutely there's there's I've been a
102:18 - web developer for I don't even know like
102:21 - let's just say like five years give or
102:23 - take a little bit and there are still
102:26 - parts of JavaScript that I I've probably
102:28 - never even seen it's certainly never
102:30 - used so yeah you definitely don't need
102:33 - everything as a web developer my method
102:36 - of learning has usually been I learned
102:39 - what I need to for a project
102:42 - and I build on that sometimes if I have
102:45 - time which is rare these days you know I
102:48 - could read a book about JavaScript and
102:50 - learn some things that I never knew and
102:51 - don't really need right now
102:52 - but once you start to get busy with with
102:55 - clients or something like it's just
102:57 - really hard to just study JavaScript so
102:59 - if you're in a position of a student
103:00 - that's great and take advantage of that
103:03 - and learn a lot but if you're actually
103:05 - trying to make money and have a family
103:07 - or have responsibilities to take up a
103:09 - lot of your time learn what you have to
103:11 - learn to get the job done and try to do
103:13 - your best to piece it all together on
103:20 - kids please can anyone tell me which is
103:23 - a good place to learn web development
103:24 - other than free code camp code Academy
103:28 - is good Udacity is good I don't really
103:37 - do much on udemy but people say udemy is
103:40 - good West vos has all these courses that
103:43 - everybody talks about says how great
103:45 - they are I haven't done one of the West
103:47 - vos courses but a lot of people that I I
103:50 - know are good developers say that the
103:52 - courses are good so maybe want to check
103:54 - that out
104:27 - David says that Kevin Powell dev tips
104:34 - and Brad if you see also have great
104:38 - videos on YouTube that's yeah I have
104:41 - never watched anything well I've watched
104:43 - it it's but not the other two but I
104:45 - really do like dev tips some of that
104:48 - stuff is a little bit old but I think
104:50 - it's still really useful a lot of the
104:51 - stuff about CSS and just general design
104:53 - principles are really good and the guy
104:59 - who is Travis a Travis's are really like
105:01 - positive uplifting personality I always
105:04 - like that about the dev tip videos Alexi
105:10 - says has someone done freelancing in up
105:13 - work or some other platform I'm in the
105:16 - urge for money I haven't done something
105:20 - like up work but so I can't speak
105:26 - personally from it but if you're gonna
105:28 - do some sort of online platform I
105:30 - definitely do one that makes you take a
105:33 - test to get into and really like make
105:36 - sure that you get paid what you're worth
105:38 - some of them just let anybody in and
105:42 - then you end up getting outbid and if
105:45 - you get a job you have to get underpaid
105:47 - like severely underpaid so that would be
105:50 - my only advice and going with different
105:52 - work things so I'm not familiar with up
105:54 - work in particular so I can't say
105:56 - anything specifically to that but just
105:58 - in general like freelancing platforms
106:00 - that's that would be my advice
106:13 - Alexei says I would do websites for food
106:25 - Stefan says what do you think about view
106:29 - I have not used you I don't have a
106:31 - personal opinion above you based on
106:34 - experience but there are developers that
106:37 - I think are great and that I respect
106:39 - that love you so I have it generally a
106:45 - good opinion about you but I just don't
106:47 - really know enough about it to give you
106:49 - more than that if anybody else has
106:52 - worked with you before please let us
106:54 - know in the latch at when you think
106:56 - about it
107:06 - Oh Michael Caruso is on the site between
107:08 - the counters you have a days remaining
107:12 - display with 1800 on the actual site
107:15 - yeah this is yeah that's not me I don't
107:20 - make that I don't manage any of the
107:22 - content on this site so I can't do
107:25 - anything about this these are like
107:26 - pre-made in Photoshop or something
107:43 - let's see so CMD in code so I'm guessing
107:48 - it's command in code says do you think
107:50 - someone should learn vanilla JavaScript
107:52 - before jQuery or another library or do
107:54 - you think it helps to illustrate some
107:56 - fundamentally important concepts I have
108:01 - some mixed feelings about this so all
108:05 - right here's how I feel if you're having
108:07 - like a free online like learning
108:09 - tutorial for people to learn on their
108:11 - own
108:12 - I think jQuery can be very useful early
108:14 - on even before you get to other
108:16 - JavaScript stuff to build up some of
108:18 - that confidence if you're teaching
108:20 - JavaScript in a like a university I
108:23 - would not go with jQuery first unless
108:27 - the course was like I don't know like
108:30 - web development for non computer science
108:32 - majors who just want to get into
108:34 - something maybe I'd do it then but if
108:36 - you're really trying to learn
108:37 - programming in Shawano javascript in a
108:39 - university I would go vanilla JavaScript
108:43 - otherwise if it's just an online course
108:46 - center of course I would go jQuery and
108:49 - like I said earlier I think the key is
108:52 - you want to help people who are new who
108:55 - are most like that on their own and
108:56 - don't know other developers you want to
108:58 - help them start to get that feeling of
109:00 - I'm really building something cool like
109:02 - to feel the magic of web development
109:05 - right I mean like you understand I'm
109:07 - saying with the magic like things
109:09 - working on the page you click the button
109:11 - and things happen like it when you first
109:13 - do that it feels great like you're
109:16 - creating things and and they're they're
109:19 - cool so going in first what jQuery
109:23 - allows you to do that and then if they
109:26 - really want to stick with it they're
109:28 - gonna eventually get into the vanilla
109:30 - JavaScript like it's they're gonna have
109:31 - to write so that's my take on it I'm
109:35 - definitely open to hearing alternative
109:37 - opinions about that too I mean I'm I'm
109:40 - no expert but that's that's generally
109:43 - how I feel about it I started out I
109:46 - don't know probably with a blend of
109:48 - JavaScript and jQuery I tried my best to
109:51 - to learn both but realistically when I
109:55 - had
109:56 - projects that needed to get done I
109:58 - turned to jQuery most of the time
110:00 - because that was the easiest quickest
110:02 - way for me to get things done it wasn't
110:06 - until I really started getting serious
110:07 - with react that I forced myself to learn
110:09 - how to do more with vanilla JavaScript
110:15 - so anyway hopefully that was a decent
110:17 - answer to your question let me know if
110:19 - it if it wasn't if you have any
110:21 - follow-up questions Patrick O'Donnell
110:30 - says funny thing about spaghetti code I
110:32 - once did an app like that but it ran in
110:35 - production long after I left the company
110:37 - no one can figure out how to replace it
110:40 - that's that's sure that's the other
110:42 - thing I'm always worried like I want to
110:44 - convert everything I'm doing to react
110:47 - and have like very standard things that
110:48 - we do like coding standard like style
110:53 - standards and and all that so that you
110:56 - know if and when I leave someone could
111:00 - come in and very reasonably like take
111:04 - over everything and figure it out but
111:06 - when I have apps like what we just
111:08 - worked on today I'm not confident that
111:10 - that could happen but I hope this is
111:12 - really the last thing that I built that
111:14 - I need to convert over to kind of our
111:16 - newer organized way of doing things
111:19 - and then I will be at that point where
111:21 - everything is at least somewhat
111:24 - standardized with the accept that kind
111:25 - of Kenko institute site I still need to
111:28 - get some jQuery out of that site but
111:31 - other than that like I'm almost to that
111:33 - point and especially with all these
111:35 - videos there's a video a record now of
111:37 - my thinking so someone could come in and
111:41 - if they really wanted to didn't know
111:43 - something they could go right to the
111:45 - video where we did that and find out
111:47 - about it so I don't want to leave people
111:49 - hanging if I do leave here I'm not like
111:53 - I don't have another job offer for
111:55 - anything right now so I'm not saying I'm
111:56 - gonna leave but I just want to make it
111:58 - easier for the next person if it happens
112:13 - let's see
112:17 - hüseyin says hey dude you have got a
112:20 - nose on your face
112:23 - you're right that's that's definitely
112:27 - true I have one it's right in the middle
112:29 - thank you let's see what are your
112:41 - thoughts on react versus you I don't
112:43 - know I answered a question by view
112:45 - earlier so I'm just gonna stick with
112:46 - that I don't know enough about view to
112:48 - really give you a good answer and
112:49 - reactors a few I will say view seems
112:52 - cool but I don't know that much about it
112:54 - and I really do like react I have fun
112:56 - developing in react David said good
113:01 - advice thank you you're welcome I'm glad
113:03 - that that can help you out a little AK
113:10 - acted to mind there's another cool front
113:12 - end channel okay cool so it's a CA de mi
113:16 - ND awesome thank you for for sharing
113:20 - that
113:29 - we're trying to get the Google
113:32 - Translation so our ten-hour Tim said
113:35 - akka divine is another cool friend
113:36 - Channel so sorry I couldn't say right
113:39 - off the bat it was in where they call it
113:42 - Cyrillic characters Russian I guess so
113:48 - anyway I did the Google Translate
113:49 - hopefully that's that's correct for your
113:51 - name let me know if it's not I'd like to
113:53 - pronounce it correctly if possible
113:55 - Hussein says yes I did an up work it
113:58 - works only get hourly paid jobs with
114:01 - verified payers okay thank you thank you
114:05 - for adding that personal experience as
114:08 - always I think one of the best things to
114:11 - to be able to draw from when you you
114:15 - know when you're considering doing
114:17 - something like up work or even getting
114:19 - with a new company being able to talk to
114:21 - people who've been there or are there
114:22 - that's gives you a lot of good insight
114:28 - on how says Jessie can you mention the
114:31 - name of the freelancer page you have
114:33 - worked I think it was freelancer I think
114:36 - it's called freelancer comm I did that
114:39 - there was another one called thumbtack
114:41 - and freelancer.com I probably made like
114:45 - $15 from total I mean it was it was
114:50 - crazy you're doing work for like I don't
114:53 - know
114:53 - like dollar less than ten dollars an
114:55 - hour sometimes it's just it's it wasn't
114:58 - a good experience and you have to do so
115:01 - much work cheaply to build up your
115:03 - portfolio and get a lot of good reviews
115:05 - it's not worth it thumbtack was a little
115:08 - bit different I think I got one client
115:11 - from thumbtack and maybe made like I
115:16 - don't know $150 total after doing some
115:19 - stuff it was really like didn't make
115:22 - much from it
115:30 - michael says i spent 15 years building
115:35 - casinos around the country and that was
115:37 - the biggest thing I built that that's
115:40 - the feeling I want these days from
115:42 - coding wow that's really cool
115:47 - she went everywhere and build casinos or
115:50 - stuff that's that's cool so were you
115:52 - like construction worker architect or
115:54 - something like you don't have to answer
115:56 - if you don't want to I'm just kind of
115:57 - curious
116:06 - Joshua says hello there watch some of
116:09 - your vids like it so much I subbed right
116:12 - now awesome thank you for subscribing
116:18 - david says since back in JavaScript as
116:20 - possible with node and the like can we
116:22 - skip PHP in those I it's definitely
116:25 - possible to skip PHP and other back-end
116:26 - languages you can pretty much do
116:28 - anything that you need to do with just
116:30 - all JavaScript nowadays so I I know a
116:35 - bit of PHP and a tiny bit of c-sharp and
116:38 - a tiny bit of some other languages but I
116:40 - rarely use them and yeah so it just kind
116:44 - of depends on what you want to do if
116:46 - there's a specific technology you'd like
116:48 - to work with it uses different language
116:49 - then you learn it but if you're not
116:52 - really sure you know if there's no
116:55 - specific technology like let's say if
116:57 - you really want to work with WordPress
116:58 - yeah learn PHP if you don't have
117:00 - anything like that I'd say just stick
117:02 - with JavaScript you know you can
117:04 - front-end back-end for the price of
117:06 - learning one language you can't beat
117:08 - that deal Joshua says by the way is it
117:12 - possible for you to make a C tutorial
117:14 - series or an Android app development
117:16 - tutorial you know what we are gonna do
117:19 - some stuff with react native so it won't
117:21 - be in C or Java or Kotlin or anything
117:24 - like that it'll be in JavaScript but you
117:26 - will be able to build Android and iOS
117:30 - apps with it so we already kind of
117:34 - started a repo for that and I haven't
117:36 - done that many videos with it but I hope
117:38 - to after I'm finished with this current
117:40 - project that we're gonna be working on
117:42 - until probably like the end of February
117:44 - and then hopefully we can switch over
117:47 - and do some more with react native which
117:49 - which is what we'll do the Android iOS
117:51 - stuff with let's see
117:58 - heart says I love react to I am good
118:01 - with front-end stuff now I need to get
118:03 - into back-end what frameworks would you
118:04 - suggest for a back-end EV like Express
118:08 - everybody uses Express with node so like
118:14 - I'm willing for these streams we use a
118:17 - lot of react with Express and node and
118:22 - we build a ton of stuff with that
118:40 - michael says a slot technician kept the
118:42 - machines running along with keeping the
118:45 - accounting systems warm
118:46 - ok cool very cool I have an uncle he
118:49 - used to be a dealer that casinos I so
118:54 - I've never really worked it one before
118:55 - to be honest with you I actually have
118:58 - never like gambled in a casino so don't
119:03 - have a lot of like personal experience
119:05 - with it but I do know I know a few
119:07 - people that have worked at them there's
119:09 - a casino somewhat close to where I live
119:14 - javascript says are you talking what I
119:16 - think you're talking about with react
119:18 - native yeah well definitely so I
119:21 - actually have several projects I want to
119:23 - do with react native but this JavaScript
119:26 - on a AF for sure needs to be done with
119:29 - react native right like people are going
119:31 - to expect to have mobile apps with this
119:35 - this network I think that's that's a
119:37 - given now if you're going to do
119:38 - something like this
119:40 - Mobile is just expected so and since
119:43 - we're doing it with react it won't be
119:45 - too much of a stretch to make it work on
119:48 - with react native there's definitely
119:51 - some some differences in the way you do
119:54 - CSS and things like that
119:56 - the differences in the way you do
119:58 - routing but the logic behind it and
120:01 - grabbing data and things for sure it is
120:07 - going to be pretty much the same
120:15 - alright Gander 7s2 leave a thanks for
120:18 - watching and I think thanks for chatting
120:20 - with us so hopefully I'll see you back
120:24 - here and some other streams later on
120:28 - alright so I'm at the bottom the live
120:30 - chat now I have a few more messages
120:31 - coming in but we'll probably be
120:33 - finishing this in a few minutes here and
120:37 - I've gotten a lot of messages so
120:40 - hopefully I didn't miss anything very
120:41 - important for work I think I'm good I'm
120:46 - duck checking now I think I'm good umm
120:52 - so let me finish up these last few few
120:55 - messages here harsh says okay have you
121:00 - ever tried using blue bird to cancel
121:02 - promises if yes can you make a series on
121:05 - that I have not used blue bird so sorry
121:09 - I've never used blue bird I think I read
121:14 - a tutorial on it or something at some
121:16 - point like a blog post but that's that's
121:18 - all my experience so I wouldn't be
121:20 - comfortable doing a tutorial on it but
121:23 - if anybody knows of a good tutorial with
121:25 - glue bird you know please put in the
121:27 - live chat so to at least have some
121:30 - resources that I can I can give you
121:32 - there Vivek says networking is a good
121:36 - field
121:36 - yeah for sure I actually took some of
121:40 - like the Cisco Networking certifications
121:42 - because I was going to get into
121:43 - networking and then a lot of stuff
121:45 - happened I ended up not getting into it
121:46 - but I I agree let's see
122:00 - vivix says this AI is good or networking
122:02 - for to get a job in the future yeah I
122:05 - think AI is gonna just be like crazy in
122:08 - terms of jobs in the future it's really
122:12 - cool I talked to a developer on
122:14 - Instagram yesterday about it and she was
122:17 - saying like she wants to get into
122:19 - machine learning ai stuff and I'm like
122:21 - I'm gonna be jealous of you when you do
122:24 - because that's that's really cool stuff
122:28 - let's see harsh says like CCNA yeah
122:31 - exactly I was doing the CCNA
122:34 - certifications just like cisco certified
122:36 - network associate or something like that
122:40 - yeah so I went through like they let me
122:43 - break it down and I don't know how they
122:45 - do it now but you took two tests so like
122:46 - halfway through the course you take one
122:48 - test halfway through you take another
122:50 - test you have to pass both of them I
122:51 - passed the first test and then by the
122:53 - time I get to the second test I didn't
122:55 - really want to go into network anymore
122:57 - so I did take the test but I I didn't
123:00 - pass it like honestly I didn't really
123:02 - study it all for it so I I wish I did it
123:06 - was kind of a waste all that time and
123:08 - money to do it so I wish I would have
123:14 - just spent a you know a few hours at
123:16 - least studying and I could have passed
123:17 - it but oh well I like what I'm doing now
123:20 - so I guess it worked out
123:27 - let's see all right I'm gonna wrap
123:31 - things up now this was a great live chat
123:33 - it's a lot of stuff and we covered a lot
123:36 - of different things and we finished what
123:40 - we wanted to get finished and in this
123:43 - old-school jQuery app so hopefully I'll
123:47 - never have to work on this again and I
123:53 - have a few more things coming in cool
123:58 - alright so nope no questions okay is
