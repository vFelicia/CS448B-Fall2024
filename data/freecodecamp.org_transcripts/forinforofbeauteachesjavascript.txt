00:00 - four in and four of are ways to loop
00:03 - through objects four n will loop through
00:06 - property names and four of will loop
00:09 - through property values
00:11 - here is the basic usage we have four and
00:15 - you have to put a variable in
00:17 - and then the object name and then down
00:19 - here is what you want to do
00:21 - and for up for the variable name of
00:25 - object
00:26 - and then some
00:28 - statements of what you want to do so
00:30 - that's the basic usage let's look at
00:32 - some actual examples i'm going to create
00:34 - a variable here let person equal
00:38 - f
00:38 - name bow l name cards arms 2 because
00:42 - i do have two arms
00:44 - so i'm going to create this object
00:46 - person and i'm also going to create an
00:47 - array
00:49 - and we're just going to have three
00:50 - numbers in it 357 and then we're going
00:53 - to create a custom property on the array
00:55 - and call it hello
00:57 - so first we're going to use the person
00:59 - object
01:06 - we create this for
01:08 - in loop we're going to have a variable x
01:11 - in person here we're going to loop
01:14 - through the property names
01:16 - so i'm showing that we're going to add
01:20 - something to this text variable we're
01:22 - going to add
01:24 - person and then we're gonna get the
01:26 - property name
01:27 - this is actually just a way to to add
01:30 - the property value to text
01:32 - because when you have an object
01:35 - and you in the brackets you put the
01:37 - property name it's going to get the
01:39 - value of that property and we add it to
01:41 - text
01:42 - and then i'm going to console.log
01:45 - the property name and then we're going
01:48 - to console.log
01:49 - text which is
01:51 - all the property values that we added to
01:54 - up here
01:55 - let's see that
01:57 - okay so you can see we have fname lname
02:00 - and arms that's when we're
02:02 - console.logging x and x is always the
02:05 - property name
02:06 - and then here we're passing in the
02:09 - property value to text and we're going
02:11 - to console.log text
02:14 - okay now the
02:16 - of
02:17 - loop the for of loop will not work on
02:19 - person because person is not iterable
02:23 - the the for in
02:24 - loops through innumerable properties
02:27 - while for of loops through iterable
02:29 - objects such as array map and set
02:32 - so let's just give you an example we
02:34 - have this array here and i'm going to
02:36 - create another loop i'm going to show
02:38 - you four in and for of on this one
02:42 - if you use for in on arrays it will
02:45 - return the name of your user defined
02:47 - properties in addition to the numeric
02:50 - indexes
02:51 - this usually is not what you want when
02:53 - iterating over arrays you usually want
02:55 - to use a traditional for loop so let me
02:57 - show you what i mean
03:01 - so i made the 4 in loop i'm just going
03:03 - to copy that and turn that into a 4 of
03:07 - loop
03:09 - and let's run that
03:12 - when we do the
03:14 - let i
03:15 - in
03:16 - array and we're going to console.log
03:18 - that this is actually going to return
03:20 - the numeric indexes look the array is 3
03:24 - 5 7 but what we're returning is 0
03:27 - 1
03:28 - 2
03:29 - and then foo because 0 is the index of 3
03:34 - 1
03:35 - is the index of 5
03:37 - and 2 is the index of 7 because arrays
03:42 - just count 0 1 2 and so on for the
03:45 - indexes and then we're also going to
03:48 - return any user defined properties
03:51 - and we've set
03:54 - foo foo right here is the user defined
03:56 - property
03:58 - now that's what the in loop is gonna do
04:00 - the of loop is gonna be a little bit
04:03 - more of what you expect it's just gonna
04:05 - go through all the items in the array
04:07 - the items in the array are three
04:10 - five and seven
04:12 - hello is not actually in the array it's
04:15 - just the value of this user defined
04:18 - property so that's four in loops and
04:20 - four of loops thanks for watching my
