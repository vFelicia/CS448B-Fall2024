00:00 - Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping 
tool that is great for designing websites. And  
00:06 - this course joy will show you how to use it. Joy 
is a prolific and excellent tutorial creator. Hey  
00:13 - guys, you're here. This is a big material 
for complete beginners. And today, you and  
00:18 - me together, we're going to make a complete 
responsive web design, both for the desktop  
00:22 - version, and another one for the mobile version. 
So this is the homepage of our desktop version. So  
00:27 - do you see this nav items over here, home teachers 
contact us signing according to this nav items,  
00:35 - we have four pages, okay, let me walk you 
through all the pages and sections. Okay,  
00:39 - so this is the home page, I mean, the landing 
page over here, and then if I scroll down, then  
00:43 - we're going to find this section over here. And 
then this section over here are offered courses.  
00:49 - This is the Education website, okay. And then if 
I scroll down, then you're going to find this over  
00:53 - here. And then lastly, we have this footer over 
here. All right, let me zoom out a little bit.  
00:58 - And this is the teacher section over here, you 
can see that. So this is the teacher section  
01:02 - over here, we're going to make some cards over 
here along with some buttons. And we're going to  
01:05 - also work with svgs. This is the footer over here 
for this page. And then we have this contact us  
01:11 - page over here, you can see that so we're going 
to also work with icons, you see these icons over  
01:15 - here, we're going to work with them, and also 
make some forms over here as well, you can check  
01:20 - out the sign up page over here as well. This 
is the last page, you can download this entire  
01:24 - figma file through the link in the description 
down below. So once you download the figma file,  
01:28 - you're going to find all of these pages over 
here. So this carries the next design. I mean,  
01:32 - this one over here, and this one carries the 
mobile design. Look at that we have the mobile  
01:38 - design over here. Okay, so this is our homepage, 
let me walk you through this. Okay, so this is  
01:43 - the homepage over here. And these are the style 
guides, I'm in the typographic guides that we're  
01:46 - going to follow, okay, what will be the font 
size of the logo, font size of the large text,  
01:52 - font size of the button, text, etc. Every design 
carries the style guide. Okay, let me show you.  
01:59 - The mobile carry the style guide laptop, 
the cabinet design carries the style guide  
02:04 - as well. The laptop design also carries this 
style going over here and the next version,  
02:08 - this one is at the very top, we're going 
to find this style guide over here.  
02:12 - So once you download the finger file, you're going 
to find all of these pages over here you see this,  
02:17 - the next step carries the design for the next 
version. And the mobile page carries the design  
02:22 - for the mobile version. Okay, so I'm going 
to click over here also, you're gonna find  
02:26 - design for the laptop and the tablet version as 
well over here. So this is a web design for the  
02:31 - mobile version. Okay, let me actually zoom in 
a little bit like that, look at that. This is  
02:36 - our homepage over here. And then this is the next 
section, third section, fourth section, and this  
02:41 - is our footer over here. Okay, let me zoom in 
a little bit. There we go. And then we have our  
02:48 - social media icons over here as well. And 
then look at this teacher section over here.  
02:53 - And this is the rest of the design. 
So today, you and me together,  
02:58 - we're going to design the Dexter version. Okay, 
this one, and the mobile version will see this  
03:04 - laptop and tablet. This is your homework. After 
this tutorial, you're going to practice over here,  
03:11 - okay, you're going to make this web design 
for the tablet version. And also you're  
03:15 - going to make the web design for the left version 
as well. Okay, so these two are your homeworks.  
03:21 - This entire video is divided according to these 
chapters over here, there is one over here,  
03:26 - you're going to find the timestamps on the 
description down below. So first of all,  
03:30 - we're going to look at all the tools figma 
carries. So once we have covered all the tools  
03:34 - figma carries, then we're going to start making a 
responsive web design for the next version first,  
03:39 - and then we're going to start making the web 
design for the mobile version. By the way, this  
03:43 - entire video is made for beginners who doesn't 
know anything about figma. So we're going to start  
03:47 - from scratch, I will not use any plugins, 
libraries or design systems just plainly from  
03:52 - scratch, we're going to use all the tools that 
FEMA provided and we're going to make the design  
03:57 - using the tools only. If this video gets at least 
2000 likes then I'm going to make another video at  
04:03 - once level figma tutorial, where I'll be covering 
how to make a web design using the design system  
04:09 - plugins, libraries, prototypes, and also how to 
save time as well. So hit the like button and  
04:15 - also hit the subscribe button so the gear brother

04:28 - And for the laptop version, it is 1024 pixels. 
And for the tablet version, this is 768 pixels.  
04:34 - And for the mobile version, I have picked

07:58 - you're going to come back to your figma dashboard 
over here. So this is our practice project, I have  
08:04 - included a link in the description down below, 
you click that, and you're gonna come over here.  
08:09 - So once you come over here, you're 
gonna click this duplicate option. Okay,  
08:12 - so if you click on this duplicate, then it's 
going to duplicate your project on your profile  
08:17 - like this. First of all, let's inspect what we 
have on our left panel over here, you see this  
08:24 - panel over here. So you see this layers over here, 
this layers represents all of this layers that  
08:30 - we have over here. And this assets over here, 
I'm going to discuss in details about this one,  
08:35 - when I am discussing about the components 
part, this one over here, part number nine.  
08:39 - All right, now I'm gonna come back layers over 
here. And this one represents all my pages. Okay,  
08:45 - so these are all my pages over here, if I click 
this over here, it's going to hide my pages.  
08:50 - If you click it back, it's going to show me all 
the pages that I have. If you want to create a new  
08:54 - page, then you can click this plus sign over here, 
and you can name it whatever you want. Like I'm  
08:58 - going to name page one over here, like this, and 
I'm going to hit enter. If you want to delete a  
09:02 - page, then you can just right click over here and 
delete this like that. Or perhaps if you want to  
09:07 - rename it, then you can click this over here. So 
I'm going to delete this, okay, I don't need it.  
09:11 - So all our designs are arranged into these pages 
over here. First of all, you have the Start button  
09:16 - over here, I mean start page over here, you can 
see this. So you can see this thumbnail over here,  
09:20 - the topics covered page over here, the breakpoints 
over here. And if I come to this dekstop page,  
09:26 - you're going to find the web design for the next 
version. Okay, if I click this laptop over here,  
09:31 - you're going to find the design for this laptop 
version. Okay, similarly for the tablet as well.  
09:36 - This is the design for the tablet version. This 
is the mobile version. This one is the responsive  
09:40 - test. I'm going to discuss about this part when 
I'm discussing the constraints providing this one,  
09:45 - Part Number eight, I have included a small sample 
on this page over here so that they can test how  
09:51 - products work in figma. So I'm going to discuss 
paradise in Part number five. And this page,  
09:58 - the assets page carries all our assets, all 
our illustrations and social media icons,  
10:04 - we're going to make our web design easy, all 
of this assets over here and this section,  
10:08 - the credit section carries all the links from 
where I have downloaded the illustrations. Okay,  
10:13 - so you can see this over here, if you double click 
over here like this, then you can copy this link,  
10:17 - and you can go to that link and see the 
original source of the illustrations. Alright,  
10:22 - then I'm back to the start page over here. And 
now we're here I'm going to create a new frame,  
10:26 - okay, by the way, all our designs are arranged in 
two frames, okay, if I hit F, or if I click this  
10:32 - over here, this frame button, don't worry, I'm 
going to discuss in details, I would all the tools  
10:36 - on this top panel, and on this right panel over 
here, okay, if I select this frame over here,  
10:41 - and if I drag it like this, like that, okay, 
by the way, regarding the basic movements,  
10:46 - you can use your mouse scroll to go top to 
bottom like this, okay, if you hit Shift  
10:50 - and throw your mouse wheel, you can go left to 
right like this. Okay, if you hit Ctrl, and if  
10:56 - you use a mouse scroll, then you can go zoom in 
and zoom out like this, look at that. Alright.  
11:03 - Alright, so I'm back over here on this 
frame over here, all our design in all  
11:07 - our elements are arranged into frames, 
okay, let's say that I have a circle, okay,  
11:12 - I'm going to hit a ball. And I'm going to draw 
a circle over here like this, that, and now I'm  
11:17 - going to create a rectangle, okay, if I hit r on 
my keyboard, then I can draw a rectangle over here  
11:21 - like this. Let's say that I want some text, okay, 
if I hit t on my keyboard, and click over here,  
11:26 - then I can write text, okay, like this. Control 
a, and you increase the font size over here to 50.  
11:34 - Not 50, let's say 200. Okay, like that, look at 
that, we have some text over here as well. And so  
11:40 - look over here, this is our frame, okay. And this 
frame carries all our elements over here, this,  
11:47 - this ellipse over here, you see this ellipse, 
it gets highlighted in blue, you can see this  
11:51 - blue highlighted color, okay? If I highlight 
the rectangle, look at this, I'm selecting the  
11:56 - rectangle, okay, if I select the text over here, 
like this, look, it gets highlighted over here.  
12:03 - And do you see these two buttons over here, if 
I click this, then it's going to hide me the  
12:07 - frame like this, look at that. Okay, now look at 
this, I can move this frame anywhere I want. Okay,  
12:12 - if I do it like this, look at that. But if 
we want to lock the position of this frame,  
12:17 - what you can do is you're gonna click this over 
here, the frame, or you can just click on the name  
12:22 - over here, usually, you see this frame number 52, 
I'm going to click this on the name, and then I'm  
12:28 - going to click this lock button over here, then 
it's going to lock me the position it is, it's not  
12:33 - going to move from its position is going to stay 
fixed over here, including all the assets that is  
12:39 - carried on the frame. Now look, I can't select 
the text, I can't select this shapes over here  
12:44 - as well is going to get locked over here. In order 
to unlock that, I'm going to click this over here  
12:49 - like this unlock. Now I can move it and I can 
select all of these elements over here as well  
12:53 - like that. So I'm going to delete this frame over 
here like this. Alright, now we're going to keep  
12:57 - our content inside our frame as it is, or we can 
also arrange them into groups, we can group them  
13:03 - directly, or we can also use the Auto Layout 
option. So if so if I select all of them over  
13:08 - here, and if I right click over here, and we're 
going to get this option over here, auto layout,  
13:13 - add auto layout, I'm going to discuss in details 
about this tool on part number seven over here.  
13:19 - So if I right click over here, then I'm going to 
get this add Auto Layout option. Along with that  
13:24 - I have this option group selection, if I click on 
that is going to behave is going to behave like  
13:29 - a group. Okay, if I remove my mouse and click 
over here, outside this box, then look at this,  
13:36 - it gets it removes the blue outline. If I click 
over, if I hover over here, look, all the elements  
13:42 - gets highlighted, which means that it acts like 
a group. Okay. So if I want to ungroup this,  
13:48 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to click over 
here and Ctrl Shift g Ctrl, Shift g like this. Now  
13:54 - look, it will behave individually like that, look 
at that, this is behaving individually, there is  
13:59 - one is behaving individually, there is one as 
well. Same thing goes for the oral Layout option.  
14:04 - Okay, now I'm going to fill all of them again and 
I'm going to create a new group over here. Okay,  
14:09 - group selection. Now look, it behaves like a 
group. Okay, let's say that you want to move  
14:13 - Okay, now let's say that you just want 
to select the rectangle and nothing else.  
14:18 - So in this cases, what you have to do is you 
can double click on the rectangle like this,  
14:23 - there is just like just the rectangle over 
here, or what you can do is you can hit Ctrl  
14:28 - on your keyboard control and click one time over 
here, then is to select only the rectangle. If  
14:34 - you want just only the text, you're going to 
select Ctrl on your keyboard and just select  
14:39 - the text over here like this, or what you have 
to do is you're gonna select this whole thing,  
14:43 - and then double click over here like this. Look 
at that, it's going to select your text over here.  
14:49 - Now we're going to discuss in details I want all 
the tools that is listed on the top bar over here,  
14:54 - this one over here, and all the tools that is 
listed on the right side over here. So let's  
14:58 - get started. Alright, The very first thing 
that I want to talk about is a movement,  
15:02 - how will you move back and forth in 
your figma file, okay, so if you hit  
15:07 - shift, and then if you scroll your mouse wheel, 
then you can go left and right like this,  
15:12 - look at that. Okay, so if you release 
this shift and just use your mouse scroll,  
15:18 - then what you can do is you can just scroll top 
to the bottom like this, look at that. Okay,  
15:23 - so in order to go top to bottom, you're going to 
use a mouse scroll like this, okay? Like that.  
15:28 - And if you want to go to left to right, then what 
you're going to do is you're going to hit shift,  
15:32 - and then you're going to scroll your mouse like 
that, okay, that you're going left to right,  
15:36 - if you want to zoom in and zoom out, what you're 
gonna do is you're gonna hit Ctrl, and then you're  
15:41 - gonna use your mouse scroll like this, look at 
that, I'm zooming out. And then I'm zooming in  
15:47 - like that, look at that, okay, and you can 
also use this hand tool over here, okay? If you  
15:53 - hover over here, or perhaps you can also use 
h, t on your keyboard like this. And then you  
15:58 - can pinch your left mouse button, or you can 
just click over here, and you can just move  
16:04 - back and forth like this, look at that. There we 
go. Let's talk about this feature over here. So  
16:10 - if you click over here, you have two options, the 
move option and the scale option. First of all,  
16:15 - let's look at the move option. Okay. So if 
I click this move option, or shortcut V,  
16:21 - okay, you can see all the shortcuts over 
here v for move and scale, it is key, okay,  
16:27 - so I'm going to select that move option over 
here, V, okay, and then I'm gonna come over here,  
16:32 - and then I'm going to select this frame, in order 
to like this frame, you're gonna select this name  
16:36 - over here. And then what you're going to do is 
you're gonna move it like this, look at that,  
16:40 - you can move freely, independently, anywhere you 
want. Okay, you can select any frame you wish,  
16:46 - for instance, let's say that I want to select this 
frame over here, okay? And then I'm gonna move it  
16:51 - anywhere I want like this, because that I can 
move it like that, not just frame, you can move  
16:56 - any element, okay, if you want to move this image, 
then you can also move it like this, look at that,  
17:00 - I have selected this and I'm going to move 
it like that. I can move it anywhere I want,  
17:05 - like that. Okay, Ctrl zet. In order to make 
you understand the scale feature, I mean,  
17:11 - this one even better. First of all, we need 
to look at the frame feature, this one and the  
17:17 - rectangle feature over here. So let's go. Alright, 
now I'm going to come over here and let's discuss  
17:23 - about the frame feature. Okay, so I'm going to 
come over here and then I'm going to select this,  
17:28 - or shortcut, I'm going to hit F, okay, f like 
this, then you're going to get all of this options  
17:33 - over here. Okay, who do you know what these 
are, these are your, these are the screen width  
17:38 - of various devices. Okay, so let's say that I want 
to work with mobile. Okay, so I'm gonna click this  
17:43 - phone over here and look at this, I have an iPhone 
11 Pro max. And then you see this one over here,  
17:48 - this measurement, this is the width and the 
height of the screen. Okay, I can also work  
17:53 - with iPhone eight, iPhone as a Google Pixel 
two, etc. We have a lot of options over here.  
17:59 - But if you don't want the phone, you can also 
go for the tablet, there we go. And if we want  
18:03 - to work with the desktop, boom, there we go. And 
you can also you can even also work with watch,  
18:09 - like Apple watch over here. And then we have 
social media post dimensions over here as  
18:15 - well. But if we want to make something custom, 
what you are going to do is you're going to hit  
18:19 - F like this, and then click over here like this 
and you can drag this little icon over here  
18:25 - anywhere you want and you can just customize the 
width and height according to your needs. Okay,  
18:31 - so now the next thing that I want to talk about is 
this one over here Okay, so what is this this is  
18:35 - a frame Okay, it is going to show me that it is a 
frame but if you want to change it if you want to  
18:40 - change the frame to a custom frame, let's say that 
I want to work with iPhone 11 Pro Max, okay, I'm  
18:46 - going to select this Now look, it's gonna change 
me the width and the height like that, look at  
18:51 - that, but if we want to work with it, say we have 
Surface Pro for okay look at this predefined width  
18:58 - and height Okay, if I select this, then it's gonna 
give me that width and height. If I select this  
19:04 - now look 1368 by 912 pixels, I mean 1368 is the 
width 912 is the height like that, look at that.  
19:14 - And also you can just drag like this according 
to your needs, okay, you can adjust the width  
19:19 - and height, okay? So look at this x and y, 
these are the coordinates I mean, where is your  
19:27 - frame located in your figma file, this x and y 
represents that if you drag it like this with that  
19:34 - your frame is moving to the left, I mean to the 
right, okay, if you want to move it to the left  
19:39 - like this, then you can also do it like that. 
There we go. If you want to move it vertically,  
19:45 - then you can do it with the y axis over here 
like that. And if you don't want that feature,  
19:49 - then you can just drag your frame over here and I 
will click your frame over here and drag anywhere  
19:54 - you want. Like this, look at that. Okay, let's say 
that I want to place it over Here, okay beside my  
20:02 - offered courses, frame over here like that, okay 
that I have kept it over here, and it's gonna  
20:07 - give me automatic calculations over here. I didn't 
have to worry about that. Now let's look at this  
20:12 - feature over here, the width and the height. Okay? 
You can guess it by the name. This is used to set  
20:18 - the width and height of your frame or perhaps your 
rectangles as well, or any shapes you want. Okay?  
20:24 - So I'm going to select this. So I'm going to 
select this like this and look at this features  
20:27 - over here. Okay, I'm going to select this, and I 
can individually set the numbers, let's say that I  
20:32 - want 800 pixels, Okay, I'm gonna write 800 pixels 
over here, there we go. It is 800 pixels over  
20:38 - here. You can also do mathematical calculations 
over here as well. Let's say that I want to add  
20:43 - another 50 pixels, Okay, I'm gonna write 50 over 
here. Now I'm gonna hit enter, look at that. 850  
20:48 - pixels, you can also do minus multiplications, 
etc, according to your needs. Okay, I'm gonna,  
20:54 - let's say I want to minus nine pixels 
from here it is 859 pixels. So minus nine,  
21:00 - enter, there we go. 858 50, which is a square. 
Okay, I changed my mind, I'm going to set it to,  
21:06 - let's say, 350 over here, like this. Look at that. 
Okay, so do you know what mode this is? This is  
21:11 - the portrait mode over here. And let's convert it 
to landscape mode. Okay, I'm gonna click this over  
21:16 - here like this. And do you see this tool buttons 
over here? This is the portrait mode. And this  
21:21 - is the landscape mode. Look at this. I look at my 
first of all, look at my width and height, okay,  
21:26 - the width is 350. Height is 650 is gonna get 
shifted between these two. Okay, let me show  
21:32 - you. Okay, I'm going to select this over here. Now 
look. So after selecting this button over here,  
21:35 - now look very carefully. The value of this two 
jumped, it was 650. Before, and now it's 350.  
21:44 - Okay, it was 315 hours. 650. Now look very 
carefully, I'm going to convert it back to  
21:49 - portrayed Okay, like this, look at that, look at 
that these two values are jumping at the same time  
21:54 - our frame is changing over here, look 
at this. There we go. Like that. If you  
21:59 - want to change the angle of a frame, you can 
just drag over here like this, look at this,  
22:03 - I can change the angle of my frame. Look at 
this, it is rotating. Okay, um, let me actually  
22:07 - zoom in a little bit. Now look at this, it will 
rotate like this. Okay, we have negative values,  
22:12 - we have positive values. So you can just manually 
do it as well like this. I'm going to set to zero  
22:17 - like this. There we go. Boom. Now look at this 
over here. This is the corner radius. Okay? Look  
22:22 - here very carefully. I'm going to zoom in, you see 
this, this is pointy corners, okay? So if I select  
22:28 - this, and if I drag like this on the right side, 
now look. We can set curves on our shapes and  
22:37 - frames, okay? So look at this. Look very 
carefully. Look at this, you see this? Okay,  
22:44 - now, let me talk about this one. Okay, the clip 
content what this is, okay, in order to make you  
22:48 - understand this clip content, first of all, I'm 
going to set some text over here, okay? He or you  
22:54 - can just select this option over here, but don't 
worry, I'm going to explain in details about this  
23:00 - tool and all of these properties. Okay, it is 
coming. Wait a minute, okay. I'm going to click  
23:04 - over here and then click over here like this 
look, and I'm gonna select some text or it's  
23:09 - very big. Okay, so I'm gonna, what I'm going to do 
is I'm gonna select over here, okay. 180 pixels.  
23:14 - I'm going to set it to 60 over here like this. 
Look at that. ADF Okay. Oh, sorry. fidf. Okay,  
23:20 - just some random text. Okay. I just placed some 
random text over here like this. Look at that.  
23:27 - ABC. ABC. makes more sense. Okay, so now look what 
happens. Okay, I'm gonna remove that clip content  
23:35 - from here. Okay. Look, nothing is set over here. 
Okay, now look, what I what happens is when I  
23:41 - resize it like this, look at this. Okay? The text 
is outside, the text is outside. And the frame  
23:49 - is getting resized like this, look at that. 
Okay, you can clearly see the content. Even if we  
23:57 - resize our frame, you can see that you can clearly 
see the content, even if we resize our frame,  
24:03 - even if the frame is smaller than the content. But 
look very carefully. What happens if I enable the  
24:09 - clip content over here like this look like? 
It gets kicked like a scissor. Okay. Now if  
24:14 - I resize it, now you can visibly see all 
the parts of our content over here. Okay,  
24:19 - like that. Look at that. Now, let me explain 
this feature over here. You see this feature?  
24:25 - Resize to Fit. Now look, what 
happens if I click this? Okay,  
24:29 - there we go. It resizes I mean, it removes all 
the gaps and add just to our content. There's  
24:36 - one over here. This is very useful when we're 
making buttons. Let me give an example. Okay,  
24:41 - control Zed. Let's say that I'm going to make a 
button Okay, V UTP. Or like this, and I'm gonna  
24:48 - make it a smaller, let's say 30 pixels, okay? 
And now look, and look, instead of doing this one  
24:55 - like this manually like this, we have 
to do a lot of work over here and then  
24:59 - center it over here. Like this, and then 
it is called a button over here like that,  
25:03 - instead of doing this hard work, what 
you can do is control Zed, Zed, Zed, Zed,  
25:07 - it means I'm in going, I mean, I'm going back, 
okay, by doing control Zed, like this, look at  
25:12 - that. So what you can do is simply, you just click 
on your frame, and then you click this over here.  
25:18 - Resize to Fit, there we go, boom, we made 
ourselves a button. This is just a sample  
25:23 - on how to create a button. But after a couple of 
minutes, I'm going to discuss in details how to  
25:28 - make a button using auto layout. I mean, there's 
one over here with appropriate calculations.  
25:34 - So wait a couple of minutes. So once that's done, 
I can adjust the corners over here like this,  
25:40 - look at that, there we go. Like that, I can adjust 
the corners, and then I can rotate it over here  
25:45 - like this, look at that, okay, on to exact. 
And regarding the corner radius, look at this,  
25:51 - I have this corner, I mean, I have set it to eight 
pixels, which means that it's gonna say eight  
25:56 - pixel over here, eight pixels here, here, here. 
Let's say that I didn't want the corner radius to  
26:02 - be on the right side, I just want it to be on the 
left side, just one single side. So what can we  
26:07 - do in this scenario, I'm going to select this over 
here, and I'm going to click this little icon over  
26:12 - here, okay? And then look at this, this is called 
independent corners, it is set to eight pixels for  
26:18 - all the four corners. Okay, so let's say that I 
didn't want the corner area on the right side,  
26:23 - I just wanted on the left side. So what I'm going 
to do is I'm going to do it like this, okay,  
26:26 - this is the top, this is the top left. Okay, this 
is a top right, I'm going to select this and I'm  
26:32 - going to set it to zero like this, look at that. 
Now look, the corner effect is removed. Okay,  
26:36 - I'm going to select this again. And I'm going to 
select top left, top right, bottom left, bottom  
26:43 - right, this one, okay, I'm gonna select this 00 
actually, sorry, my bad, I chose the wrong corner  
26:49 - over here, what you learn from mistakes, right? 
So I'm going to select this again, and I'm gonna  
26:53 - say to eight pixels over here and zero over here, 
like this, and then enter. Look at that. I have  
26:59 - corners over here on the left side, not on the 
right side. There we go. Now let's discuss about  
27:05 - this feature, get the slice feature. So what 
this is used is, let me actually come to my,  
27:10 - let me actually delete this, okay? I'm going 
to come on to this frame over here, okay,  
27:14 - let's say that I just want not the whole image, I 
just want the head, okay, I just want to download  
27:21 - the head, I just want to work with the head. Okay, 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click this  
27:25 - over here, slice, okay? And then I'm gonna draw a 
rectangle over here on the head section, can you  
27:31 - see this properly? Okay, there we go. Now look, I 
have a little slice over here, you can see this,  
27:36 - okay? Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to 
select this slice over here, either from here,  
27:41 - or I can directly select it here, okay, and then I 
can adjust the width and height as well like this,  
27:46 - look at that. Alright, and I can also move it 
like this, look at that, there we go. And then  
27:51 - I'm going to click it over here. And then can 
you see this Export button over here, I'm gonna  
27:56 - click this export, who is downloading this, okay, 
I'm gonna click this plus sign over here. And you  
28:02 - can set the image quality as well, you can set it 
to PNG, jpg, SVG, I'm gonna do it in SVG. Okay,  
28:08 - I'm gonna select this, and then I'm going to 
export this one, look at this, I have downloaded  
28:12 - a little file over here. So what I'm going to 
do is I'm going to drag it over here like this,  
28:17 - look at this, I just look at this over here, I 
just downloaded I mean, I just sliced the head,  
28:24 - because I just only need to work with the height 
head. Okay, now look, look at this. This is equal  
28:30 - to this one over here, this slice over here, 
I hope you understood the slice properly.  
28:35 - Now, regarding this Export button, you 
can download anything you want. Okay,  
28:39 - let me actually give you a demo. Okay, I'm going 
to delete this home here. And at the same time,  
28:43 - I'm going to remove this slice from here 
as well. And let's say that I want to  
28:47 - download this single frame over here, okay, just 
single frame, or perhaps even just the drying,  
28:52 - we're here I'm in the illustration, I just want 
to download the illustration and nothing else.  
28:56 - Or you can also download multiple files as well 
like tricky by clicking this one and then shift,  
29:01 - then click like this, then click like this as 
well. Now, let's say for keeping this simple,  
29:06 - I'm going to download this image, okay, I'm 
going to click this over here, and then I'm  
29:10 - going to scroll down at the button over here. 
And then look at this, I have the Export button,  
29:15 - I'm gonna click over here and then look at 
this. You can change the size as well you can  
29:21 - download it two times three times or four times 
the actual size, okay? And then we have the PNG,  
29:28 - SVG, jpg, PDF, etc formats, okay, you can download 
anywhere you want, I mean, you can download,  
29:34 - you can download in any format you want and 
then you're gonna hit this export frame button.  
29:39 - And yeah, this feature this preview option 
is given just to let you know that what you  
29:44 - are downloading Okay, you can see this I 
have just selected this frame, I mean, this  
29:48 - illustration over here, let's say that I 
want to see like this text over here, okay,  
29:52 - I'm gonna select this text and I'm going to 
select this export like this. And look at that.  
29:56 - It is giving it is giving me this preview that 
I have just downloaded in there. text over here.  
30:01 - Now let's discuss the shape feature. Okay, so 
I'm going to come over here, you see this shape,  
30:07 - it looks like a square, Okay, I'm gonna select 
this like this, look at this, I have a lot of  
30:11 - options. I have rectangle, line, arrow, ellipse, 
polygon, etc. Let's say that I want a polygon,  
30:17 - sorry, I want an ellipse, okay, I'm 
going to click this, or I can select Oh,  
30:22 - so I'm going to select all like this and look at 
this, I can make a circle over here. But look,  
30:27 - this circle looks distorted. And it's going to be 
very hard for me to make a perfect circle. So in  
30:33 - this case, what I'm going to do is I'm going to 
select, I mean, I'm going to hit shift. Now look,  
30:38 - it instantly became a perfect circle. And now 
while holding Shift, I can just move my mouse  
30:45 - and look, it's gonna give me a perfect circle like 
this. Look at that. Okay, this is a perfect circle  
30:50 - over here, I'm gonna delete this. And I have more 
options like a rectangle, okay? And I'm gonna  
30:56 - select rectangle like this, look at that. Okay, I 
can do it anywhere I want. I can move it anywhere  
31:02 - I want. And I can select the width and height 
accordingly. Okay, look at this. I'm moving  
31:07 - this and I'm resizing this like this. And do you 
see this little dot over here, this dot this dot,  
31:13 - dot dot over here, it is used to set the radius, 
look at this corner radius, you can do it over  
31:19 - here, or you can, you can do it over here directly 
like this. Or what you can do is you can select  
31:24 - this options over here, okay, like this, as I told 
you a little bit earlier, okay, you can do it like  
31:30 - this as well. And yeah, do you remember the scale 
button? I'm do remember this Scale tool over here.  
31:36 - This one, as I told you that I'm going to discuss 
in details after discussing this frame and this  
31:41 - rectangle. Now I'm going to discuss this. Okay, so 
what were the scale button is used, let's say that  
31:47 - you want to scale I mean, you want something, 
let's say that you want to make something bigger.  
31:53 - Okay? So in the case of this circle, do you 
remember this circle this distorted circle, okay,  
32:00 - with this, you cannot make it a perfect circle. 
Let's say that I have selected a shift. Okay,  
32:05 - shift. Now look, it looks like a perfect circle. 
Okay, I have released the chip, then let's say  
32:09 - that you want to make it a little bigger. Okay, 
what you normally do is, you're going to select  
32:13 - this like this, look at this, okay, when you 
try to make it bigger, it is going to get  
32:18 - distorted again. So in this case, what you can do 
is you can just simply select the shift, and it's  
32:24 - going to resize accordingly. Or what you can do 
is you can select this scale function over here,  
32:30 - you can select this over here directly or you can 
just select the K option on your keyboard, okay,  
32:36 - okay. And look at this, I have a different icon on 
my mouse, okay, I'm going to select V, which means  
32:43 - move, okay, look at this icon on my mouse. Okay, 
I'm gonna zoom in a little bit over this. This is  
32:49 - V, this is for the move, this is the default. And 
if I want to resize this K, look at this scale,  
32:55 - and this is move. Okay, I'm gonna give K over 
here like this. Now I'm gonna resize Look,  
32:59 - it's gonna resize proportionately, and 
proportional measurements, okay, now look at this,  
33:04 - okay? 788 by 788. Okay, I'm gonna resize it 
again. Now look at that, it's gonna give me  
33:10 - accurate proportion measurements. So I'm gonna 
remove this circle from here and I'm going to draw  
33:15 - a perfect square, okay, shift, and then, oh, 
sorry, I'm gonna hit R, which means rectangle,  
33:22 - or you can just select it from here as well, 
and shift and then drag like this. Look at this.  
33:26 - This is a perfect square. Okay, now let's talk 
about this feature this field feature Okay,  
33:32 - this is used to color your rectangle, I mean, 
color your shapes like this. To do that,  
33:36 - you can color it anything you wish. You can also 
put input the hex value, you can also change  
33:41 - the opacity over here, you can also use this 
predefined colors. Let's say that I want to use  
33:45 - sky blue over here because that enable also uses 
dropper tool. Okay, if you select this dropper  
33:51 - tool, then you can select anything you wish. Let's 
say that I want my box I'm in my square to be  
33:57 - the color of this. Okay, so I have this eyedropper 
on my hand. And when I select this over here,  
34:02 - like this, now look at my square over here, look, 
this is the same color as this one over here.  
34:10 - Now let's look at more features that we have no 
right panel over here. Okay, this features Okay,  
34:14 - I'm going to select it over here and I'm 
going to change it to the default color. Okay,  
34:18 - wait a minute, e4, e4 info like this. Oh, sorry. 
There we go. It is c four c four, c four. Alright,  
34:26 - so the first thing that I want to discuss is the 
stroke. So what this does is it gives a stroke  
34:32 - around our box. Okay, let me show you Okay, okay, 
I'm gonna select this like this. We're gonna,  
34:36 - it's gonna generate me a little stroke over 
here. Okay, can you see this black colored  
34:40 - outline over here? I'm gonna increase its width 
okay like this look 345678 910 so the stroke is  
34:49 - 10 pixels. Okay, can you see this black color tick 
stroke over here. You can also change the various  
34:55 - properties like the color the size, then should it 
be inside the box. Should it be on the center or  
35:01 - should it be outside the box like that, look at 
that, you can also hide the shadow, I mean, you  
35:05 - can also hide the stroke like this. If you select 
this eye button over here like that, look at that.  
35:10 - You can also click it over here again, and it's 
going to show me the stroke over here. And if  
35:16 - you want to remove this stroke permanently, 
you can also use the minus button over here  
35:20 - like this, look at that, it went away. Okay, 
now we're gonna look at this FX feature. Okay,  
35:25 - for that, I'm gonna just resize this a little 
bit like that. Okay, now, if I select this  
35:30 - effect button, look at this, I have this panel 
over here, okay, I have a lot of options. Like  
35:34 - if I want to make a drop shadow, or if I want 
some layer blur, or perhaps background blur,  
35:41 - we have Inner Shadow as well. For now I'm 
going to show you the drop shadow. Okay,  
35:44 - I'm going to select this over here. And yes, you 
can experiment on your own. And look at this,  
35:49 - I have a little bit of shadow, you see this 
shadow at the back of this rectangle? Let me  
35:54 - actually remove that child. Okay, look at this. 
You see that? Do you see the shadow over there?  
36:00 - Okay, I am hiding the shadow. Now let me bring 
that shadow back. Look at this. So this so  
36:04 - this drop shadow is used to make shadows, draw 
shapes, frames, buttons, cards, etc. Alright,  
36:13 - so now look at this over here. This is called 
the effect setting. Okay, so I'm going to click  
36:16 - over here and then I can adjust the shadow. 
Okay, so this is the x, which means that my  
36:22 - shadow will move left and right like 
this, look at that. Okay, look at this,  
36:26 - look, my shadow is moving left and right, if I 
want to, if I want to move the shadow, top to  
36:32 - the bottom, like this, I'm going to use this wide 
button over here. Okay, like that. Look at that.  
36:36 - And then if I want the shadow to spread, I'm 
going to use the spread over here like that, look,  
36:41 - look, the shadow is getting bigger, okay, and 
smaller as well. And you can also change the  
36:46 - color over here, opacity over here as well. 
And if you want to change the blur, you can  
36:50 - do it like this. There we go. We're increasing the 
blur. So we're going to include this drop shadow  
36:55 - when we are making buttons. Okay, let me actually 
give you a demo. Look at this, our buttons have a  
37:00 - little bit of drop shadow over here, as well as 
this cards, look at these cards. Okay, this has  
37:05 - drop shadow. So when we're making this layout, I 
mean, when we're doing this design, we're going  
37:10 - to utilize this drop shadow. Whatever I have 
discussed so far, this is the design section,  
37:15 - okay, on the right panel. So this is a prototype 
over here. After a couple of minutes, I'm going  
37:20 - to discuss about this for a live Okay, so don't 
worry, and look at this inspect over here. Okay,  
37:24 - so if I go to inspect, then is gonna generate 
me CSS code. Let's say that I want the code of  
37:30 - this one. Okay, this section over here, then I'm 
going to select this over here and look at this.  
37:34 - It is generating the CSS over here like this, look 
at that. If you're a developer, you can save time.  
37:39 - Look at this display, flex flex direction, column 
justify content center, align items, flicks start,  
37:46 - so on and so forth, along with all of this 
look, pixel measurements over here along with  
37:50 - the padding with height, etc. So this inspect tool 
is very handy. Alright, now I'm going to discuss  
37:57 - in details about all of these tools over here. 
These are the alignment tools. Okay? So in order  
38:01 - to discuss about that, I'm going to come over 
here and I'm going to draw a frame, okay, F and  
38:05 - then I'm going to drag it like this, look at that. 
Okay, so now I'm gonna write some text, okay, D,  
38:10 - and then click over here, and then some text over 
here, okay, like that. Okay, let me actually write  
38:15 - ABCD. Okay, ABCD like that on through a capital 
letter A, A, A, B, C, D, there we go. Let's say  
38:25 - that I want this text to be at the very center. 
So what will we do? Okay, so if we come over here,  
38:32 - look at this Align Horizontal center, if I click 
over here, like this, now look, our text is at the  
38:37 - very center, horizontally, okay? If I wanted 
to be at the very center vertically, I mean,  
38:43 - if I wanted to be at the very center over here, 
so what I'm gonna do, what am I gonna click, I'm  
38:47 - gonna click over here, look at this. This is the 
Align Vertical Centers like this, look at that,  
38:53 - it is at the very center, both horizontally and 
vertically. Let's say that I want to move it to  
38:57 - the very left at the very left, okay, what I'm 
going to do is I'm going to click this over here,  
39:02 - like this. This is alignment left. If you want 
alignment, right, you can also do it like this,  
39:08 - this option over here like this. So you can 
experiment with all of these values over here.  
39:13 - And regarding this, I'm going to delete 
this over here like this real quick. And  
39:17 - regarding this panel over here, I'm in this 
tool over here. And regarding this text,  
39:22 - this is the file name, okay, if you 
double click over here, then you can  
39:25 - rename it Okay, so I'm going to keep it figma 
file over here, I'm in figma tutorial over here  
39:29 - like that as it is and if you click over here 
like this, you can download this figma file,  
39:34 - you can also duplicate it, you can rename it 
any goal to delete this as well. So these are  
39:39 - the options that you have. You can also share it 
with their friends that what you created so far,  
39:44 - like you created this frames over here if you 
want to share it with their friends or perhaps  
39:47 - if you want to share it with your clients, then 
you can click the Share option over here and then  
39:51 - you're going to find appropriate details. Okay, 
so I'm gonna remove this night right now and Okay,  
39:56 - now regarding this button over here, this is 
called a present button. So if you click on here,  
40:01 - then you can see your designs life at the 
same time. If you're working with prototype,  
40:05 - then you can also view your I mean, you can also 
test the interactivity of your prototypes live.  
40:11 - Don't worry, I'm going to discuss this product 
after a couple of minutes. Okay? So let's say that  
40:15 - I'm going to click on here, okay, after selecting 
this design over here, okay, I'm gonna click this,  
40:20 - I can feel this over here. Now look at this, this 
is the desktop type program. Okay? And if I come  
40:27 - over here, if I click this arrow over here, then 
it is going to go next like this. Wait a minute,  
40:34 - these are the sections. Look at this. This is my 
design over here. Okay, I can view it over here.  
40:38 - No, no, this is very large. Okay, I want to 
make it small. So what I'm going to do is I'm  
40:42 - going to come to this options, and then I'm gonna, 
I'm gonna select this fit, scaled down to fit,  
40:48 - okay, like this. There we go. Now, now it looks 
much better. Okay, so I'm gonna come over here,  
40:54 - and I'm gonna go next. Or perhaps you can also 
use an arrow right like this, look at that,  
40:58 - he's gonna move to the next frame like this. 
So by this way, you can preview your designs,  
41:04 - what you create so far, okay, you can view 
it like this. Look at that. There we go.  
41:11 - Now we're going to discuss that what the text tool 
in details. So this tool over here, the text tool  
41:17 - is used to add text to all Web Designs. So if you 
notice carefully that every design the desktop,  
41:23 - tablet, laptop, mobile contains this chart over 
here, okay, this is the typography guide chart  
41:29 - shows that what should be the font size of 
the logo, the font size of the nav items,  
41:35 - font size of the large text, font size of 
the small text, the text of the button, etc,  
41:40 - along with the line height over here. So you can 
see that the line height of large should be 90 and  
41:46 - line height of small should be 43. Over here. Same 
goes for the mobile design as well look at this  
41:51 - over here, I have included the mobile typographic 
over here, the logo, this logo is 48 pixels,  
41:57 - then large text 32 button is 24 pixels, so 
on and so forth. It also this chart is also  
42:05 - mentioned for the laptop as well. So look at 
this over here, this is the laptop design over  
42:08 - here. And this one is the typography for the 
laptop design. Okay, so the logo is 60 pixels,  
42:14 - the button should be 30 pixels, so on and so 
forth. So I'm going to come over here, and  
42:20 - over here, I'm going to create either a rectangle 
or a frame, so you can so we can hit our like  
42:26 - this, and it's going to create me a rectangle, 
what I'm going to use a frame over here, okay,  
42:30 - control that. So if if you hit F like this, it's 
going to create a frame like this, look at that.  
42:36 - Okay, I'm going to make the frame a little 
smaller, let's say 1000 by 500. Okay, that will do  
42:44 - for this tutorial like this, look at that. 
Alright, then in order to use the text tool,  
42:49 - you directly click over here like this, and it's 
going to highlight blue over here and you're  
42:53 - going to get a plus sign on your mouse, can you 
see my mouse over here it is in plus sign, okay.  
42:59 - And if you want to do it in a shortcut way, you 
just hit t on your keyboard like this T and it is  
43:05 - going to highlight that text over here on your 
mouse. And if you click anywhere, then you can  
43:10 - get this sign over here you see this then 
you can add text like this, look at that  
43:14 - it is said 210 pixels, but by default, your text 
should be 12 pixels like this, which means that  
43:22 - Wait a minute, it should be on curved pixels 
like this, which means that it's going to be  
43:26 - very small. So what you're going to do, you're 
going to click over here okay. And you see this  
43:32 - option over here this is used to set the font size 
so what is the font size of all dekstop let's say  
43:38 - it is for the logo is 90 pixels, okay? So 
let's say to nine pixels, like this look,  
43:45 - it is set to 12 I'm gonna set 90 over here like 
this, okay, pay that enter and then is the output  
43:51 - mean this result Okay, so this is used to set the 
font size. And this one you see this this is used  
43:57 - to set the font family, it is kinda set to Roboto 
and if I click over here and I can change the font  
44:04 - family as well like this, it should be let's say 
we're going to say to Poppins like this p o p p i  
44:10 - ns Poppins, okay, now look, the font family 
changes. Similarly, I can also write sans serif  
44:15 - over here, sans. Let's go for sensation. Okay, 
I'm going to hit enter like this. Look at that it  
44:22 - changed. And if you click this drop down icon over 
here like this, then you have tons of options of  
44:28 - for fonts. You can pick any font family you 
want, like this, look at that. So I'm going  
44:33 - to say to pop in like this p o p p i ns Poppins 
like that, and I'm going to name over here, a  
44:41 - do.io like this, okay, because we're going to 
deal with this logo after all. Okay, so now the  
44:47 - next thing that I'm going to show you is this one, 
okay? This is the font weight, it is kind of set  
44:51 - to red, it is currently set to regular. You can 
also set extra light over here like this. Look at  
44:56 - that. The font weight changes, okay? You can also 
say To set it to paint like this, look at that it  
45:02 - became thin. You can also say to this extra ball, 
look at that how bold this text is. Okay, I hope  
45:08 - you understood it so far. And you see this over 
here. So this is used to set the line height, look  
45:13 - at that it is written highlighted over there line 
height, okay, so I'm going to insert it to let's  
45:19 - say regular, okay, like this. So um, this logo 
should be regular. And in order text in, I'm in  
45:25 - a retest this line height, you cannot just simply 
test with just a single line, you need multiple  
45:32 - lines, okay, so I'm going to delete it over here 
like this, and I'm going to drag this one, just  
45:37 - text, you see this text over here, I'm going to 
drag it to our test case. So in order to drag it,  
45:41 - so what you're going to do is you're gonna control 
you're going to hit control, okay, and then just  
45:46 - pick this text over here like this. And then I'm 
going to zoom out, and I'm going to click the old,  
45:52 - I'm gonna select the alt text like this old, and 
you see my mouse is getting a little shadow on  
45:59 - its back, like two months together. Okay, so I'm 
gonna select the old text and I'm going to move my  
46:05 - mouse like this, look at that, it is getting 
copied, Okay, I'm gonna come over here and  
46:10 - don't move. Okay, just First of all, just release 
your mouse click like this, okay, and then you're  
46:15 - going to release the Alt key like this look. Now 
we have successfully copied our text on here,  
46:21 - okay? Now look at this. Now, now we're gonna 
come over here, and we're gonna see like this,  
46:26 - like this, and then we're gonna see this, 
okay? Look at here, line height is set to 43.  
46:32 - And if we want to change it, then you're gonna 
click over here, or you can directly you can  
46:37 - directly put the number over here like this, let's 
say I want to say 210 pixels like this, okay? If I  
46:43 - click enter, now, look, it has 112 110 pixels of 
gap over here. Let's say that I want to set it to  
46:52 - 20. Okay, you can directly input it over 
here, like this 20 Look at that, it became  
46:56 - very congested like this. Okay, so if you click 
over here, you see this, I got a small icon, okay,  
47:03 - arrow sign icon like this, I'm going to move my 
mouse like this. Now, look, I can practice with  
47:08 - this real time like this without worrying about, 
I mean, without directly inputting the value over  
47:14 - there. Okay, look at that I'm just playing out, 
I'm just playing around with a mouse so that I  
47:18 - can find that sweet spot, which would be ideal, 
which will be the ideal line height. Okay, so I'm  
47:24 - going to change it to 43. Like that, because it is 
actually given on the style guide over here. Wait  
47:29 - a minute, over here, look at that the small text, 
it should be 30 pixels. And look at this, the line  
47:37 - height should be 43 pixels, okay? I'm going to 
come over here like this. And look at this, the,  
47:44 - the font size is 30 over here, and it is set to 
Poppins and the line height is 43. Over here. Now,  
47:50 - do you see this over here, this is called a ledger 
spacing. So line height works like this, okay,  
47:55 - but the letter spacing, legislating works like 
this is going to put cap between our little  
48:00 - like this, okay, I'm going to show you Okay, I'm 
going to keep it over here like this. And watch  
48:04 - very carefully. Oh, by the way, you can 
also input direct value over here like this,  
48:08 - clearly over here like this, then it's going 
to be 30%. Or perhaps you can also set this,  
48:13 - I mean, you can also use this mouse over here, 
and you're going to get this little arrow sign,  
48:18 - okay? So I'm going to drag like this look at 
that is going to change according to my mouse  
48:23 - movement. Okay, look at that, like this, it's 
working like that. So this is used to set the  
48:28 - ledger spacing, I hope you understood it so 
far. I'm gonna set it to zero over here like  
48:32 - this. Now look at this one. This is called the 
paragraph spacing, okay, in case if you have  
48:38 - multiple paragraphs, then this is going to work. 
Okay. So if I drag like this over here, then you  
48:43 - can see this behavior, it is working like a line 
height, but it should not work like a line height.  
48:48 - Because I have actually used some gap over here 
like this, it may actually show you wait a minute,  
48:53 - I'm going to set it to default controls that 
control set again like that, okay. So what  
48:58 - is happening is I have given some line break over 
here and there so it is behaving like a parallel,  
49:04 - but if I set it to it, or you know, state like 
this, wait a minute, just give me a second,  
49:09 - okay? It is actually the ordinal state. 
Look at this long text over here. Okay. Now,  
49:13 - I'm going to shrink it like this. Look at this. 
Okay, I'm going to shrink it like this. And it's  
49:18 - going to behave like this. Okay, let me actually 
zoom in. There we go. I hope you can see this.  
49:23 - I hope you can see my screen. Okay. I'm going to 
look at this. This is behaving just like a single  
49:28 - paragraph. Okay, now look, now look what happens 
if I use it. Okay. Now, look, it is not working.  
49:33 - The paragraph spacing is not working. This will 
only work when you have multiple paragraphs. Okay,  
49:39 - let me actually show you okay. I'm going to copy 
this one over here like this. Let's say two lines,  
49:43 - okay. Ctrl C, and then I'm going to paste 
it over here like this. Ctrl V, there we go.  
49:47 - So how many parents do we have? We have two 
parents. Now look at this paragraph height.  
49:53 - I mean, paragraph spacing, we said 23 pixels. I'm 
going to drag my mouse like this. Look at that.  
49:59 - I can see range that paragraph spacing but look, 
it's it's it is set to zero but there is some gap  
50:06 - over here that is the gap of your line height. 
Look at that. Okay, you can also right over here,  
50:11 - but if you remove that whitespace from here, 
then look, is it gonna work like that? Now look,  
50:16 - it is set to zero, exact zoo. Okay, I'm 
gonna drag it over here like this. Now look,  
50:21 - it is working perfectly fine. There we go. Let's 
do the next feature. Okay, I'm going to click over  
50:26 - here and look at this. Do you see this? This is 
the text align left text align center text align,  
50:34 - right. Okay, let's experiment. Okay, so I'm going 
to drag it, I'm going to drag the window like  
50:39 - this, okay, over here like this. Look at that. 
Now look, the text is behaving on the left side,  
50:44 - okay, text align left. Now I'm gonna change the 
center. Okay, you see this third line over here,  
50:49 - look at that it is set to left. Now he's gonna 
move to the middle like this, okay, if I click  
50:54 - over here, like this text, align center. Now look, 
it is changing the alignment, the text alignment  
50:59 - is changing to center like this. And I have also 
the option of right over here, look at that,  
51:04 - right text align, right. So if we want to, if we 
want the option of justify, you're going to click  
51:09 - this little icon over here, okay, wait a minute, 
we're gonna click this little icon over here.  
51:13 - And then you're going to find this justify over 
here, which means that is gonna, appropriately,  
51:18 - I may equally distribute the spaces in a way 
that it fills the whole box over here. Okay,  
51:25 - so let me actually make this para into a line like 
this. Now look at that, you see this one, this  
51:30 - line over here, and this line over here, look, 
the text are equally distributed inside the box so  
51:37 - that it looks like text align justified. Alright, 
so I hope you understood this alignment tools over  
51:44 - here. Now look at this tool over here, okay, or 
a width, or a height, and then fixed size. So,  
51:52 - so in order to discuss this tools over here, first 
of all, what you're going to do is you're gonna  
51:56 - reduce the size of your font size, okay? So 
I'm going to set it to let's say, let's say  
52:03 - 2020 pixels like this. Okay, now, let's 
say I want to drag it like this, okay,  
52:08 - I'm going to drag that box like that. Now, look, 
this is behaving like a fixed height, which means  
52:14 - that our pair over here will occupy What is this 
912 pixels of weight into 286 pixels of height. So  
52:27 - it is going to occupy that much amount of space in 
on our web design or perhaps on our on our frame.  
52:34 - Okay, so I can drag it like this. Now, look, it 
is gonna, I mean, those snapping guides. Okay,  
52:39 - you see, this orange Schiller's colored guide 
over here is going to work according to our box,  
52:46 - I mean, the box which carries the text, okay, so 
this is how the fixed height, I mean, fixed size  
52:53 - works, but if you snap it to or a width, which 
means that it's gonna hug the content inside the  
52:58 - box, so that there is no additional spaces, look 
at this, you see this box over here, along with  
53:03 - the blue colored guides, okay, so I'm gonna click 
over here, which is or a width, now look at that,  
53:09 - it is going to work as if it is a single line, 
first of all, and the next thing is, is not  
53:14 - going to keep any additional gaps. Okay, so let's 
say that, I want to break the line, okay, I want  
53:20 - to break the line over here like this. So you can 
also do it, you can also break the line like that,  
53:25 - there we go, it's gonna work like that. And if I, 
let's say, for any instance, this changes to like  
53:31 - this, okay, it's gonna, let's say that it changed 
to this. So what you're gonna do is if you want to  
53:37 - reduce those white spaces, normally, most of 
the people, what they do is they're gonna do it  
53:42 - like this look. They're gonna do it like this. But 
this will not give you exact measurements. I mean,  
53:49 - it is not the ideal scenario. So what you're 
going to use is you're going to use this little  
53:53 - icon over here with auto auto Wait, okay, the 
auto hide, wait a minute, these auto hide works  
53:58 - in a similar manner, okay, it just works with the 
height. Okay, I'm gonna click over here. And if  
54:03 - I select this, then it's gonna automatically 
snap those height and remove those whitespace  
54:08 - from my text like that. Okay, now let's look at 
this tools over here, these three tools over here,  
54:13 - okay, this is align top, align, and the middle 
and align and the bottom. Okay, let's say that  
54:19 - I have this text and I'm going to resize it like 
this. Okay, now look, I have a lot of space inside  
54:24 - my rectangle. And where does my text where's my 
text aligned, it is aligned at the top, very top.  
54:31 - If I want to take it on the middle like this, 
okay, I can use this one over here like this,  
54:35 - look at that, it's gonna come to the middle inside 
this box. And let's say that I want to take my  
54:40 - text at the very center. Okay, what I'm going 
to use is I'm going to use this little icon over  
54:45 - here, Li important. I get like that, look at that. 
It has aligned, it has aligned to the model. So  
54:51 - let's change it back like this at the top and then 
or a week like this. There we go. Now let's look  
54:57 - at this tools over here. Okay, you see these three 
dots. So we're here, if you select this like this,  
55:01 - then you're going to have more tools. Okay, first 
of all, you're going to get this alignment tools  
55:06 - over here, and then the decorations. Okay? So 
if you hover over here, then you're going to get  
55:10 - live preview what each every tool does, like this, 
look at this underline tool is going to underline  
55:16 - my text, okay? If I select this like this, you're 
going to not only see the result over here, live,  
55:20 - look at that, look at this little screen, okay, 
you can also see the result over here, okay,  
55:24 - like that. So I'm going to click it over here 
as well. So if I want to remove the declaration,  
55:29 - then I'm going to select this over here like 
this, none, then you can also strike through  
55:34 - the text like this, you have a lot of options. 
If you want to make two lists, look at this list  
55:38 - option over here, okay, if I click this, then it's 
going to create me a list, okay? unordered list.  
55:43 - And if we want to make it an ordered list, then 
you can click this over here, an ordered list  
55:48 - in 123, so on and so forth. So if we want 
paragraph indentation, you're going to utilize  
55:54 - this feature. Okay, wait a minute, this paragraph 
indentation feature, okay. So if you say it,  
56:00 - let's say 30 pixels like this, okay? Oh, this 
is actually not working. That's because we  
56:05 - have multiple line breaks. So I'm gonna make it 
just a single line, like this. Wait a minute,  
56:12 - just give me a second and then I'm gonna drag this 
inside my frame. Okay. Wait a second like that.  
56:21 - There we go. And it is just working like a single 
paragraph and then oral height like this. I mean,  
56:27 - oral width like this. Okay. Oh, I did in 
the wrong way. My bad. Sorry. Okay, now,  
56:33 - looks good. Now, look, I have some paragraph 
indentation at the very first of the text. Okay,  
56:38 - look at this. We have 30 because we have 30 pixels 
of gap over here. If we want to increase the gap,  
56:44 - let's say 100. Let's go 400. Okay, 100 like this. 
There we go. We have 100 pesos of gap over here.  
56:52 - Let's look at more options that we have. Okay, so 
we have the lowercase over here. Okay, this is the  
56:57 - default, I mean, the way you write it is going to 
be default. Okay. So if we want all the text to  
57:02 - be capital sized, okay, you have this uppercase, 
okay? Now look at this text, okay? lorem ipsum  
57:09 - dolor state, okay, it is in small text, lowercase 
letter, okay, I'm going to change it to uppercase  
57:15 - letter. Okay, I'm going to click over 
here and then I'm going to click this,  
57:18 - okay? It is the preview, it is going to 
give me a preview over here as well. Okay,  
57:22 - so I'm going to click this over here. Now look, 
all the text all later has changed to upper  
57:27 - upper case letters, okay, like this, look 
at that. You can also change it to lowercase  
57:31 - letters, I by clicking this, again, look 
at that all the texts are I mean, all the  
57:36 - letters are lowercase. By the way, if you want to 
change the color of your text, what you have to do  
57:41 - is you're going to select any text, okay, let's 
say that I want to see like this text over here,  
57:44 - okay, so I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm 
going to Ctrl and then click over here like this,  
57:49 - okay? Or what you can do is you can double click 
over here like this, and it is going to get  
57:53 - selected, okay, okay. And then what you're going 
to do is you're gonna scroll down over here,  
57:57 - and you see this fill option over here, you 
can change the color over here by inputting  
58:01 - your hex value over here, or what you can do is 
you can just select this option over here, okay,  
58:07 - you can get this eyedropper over here, which 
means that you can pick any color you want,  
58:11 - like this look, I'm going to select this over 
here like this. Let's say that I want to change  
58:15 - it to this color over here. Okay, so I'm going to 
select this ello the text gets colored according  
58:20 - to this color over here. Similarly, what you 
can do is you can drag this little small dot  
58:27 - over here and you can play any way you want and 
the color changes accordingly. Okay, I'm gonna  
58:32 - move this ball over here, and you're gonna 
see the changes over here. Okay, look at this,  
58:36 - I'm going to change the black letter sound, I want 
to, I want to change it to black, let's say like  
58:41 - this, okay, and let's say I want to change it to 
white. Okay, I'm gonna go over here like this.  
58:45 - By the way, you can also move this over here to 
change the color. Okay, let's say I want to go to  
58:49 - red. Okay, I'm going to come to red over here, and 
this palette over here turns to red, okay, and I  
58:54 - can move it over here as well like this. Okay? 
If you want to change the opacity, then you can  
58:58 - change it over here like this look, I'm gonna 
look I'm gonna drag this slider over here and  
59:03 - look at this effect over here. Okay, it's gonna 
get changed. Okay, look at this. I'm going to drag  
59:07 - it and look, the opacity changes, okay, if 
I turn it to zero, it's gonna be invisible.  
59:13 - Okay, effort. If we go to absolute zero, like 
this, then is going to get invisible. Okay,  
59:18 - so ladies and gentlemen, we're done discussing 
the text tool along with all its properties.  
59:25 - As a beginner, you don't have to understand 
prototypes. So this is a feature that I'm  
59:29 - discussing right now, the paradigm over here, 
this one okay, but for the sake of this tutorial,  
59:34 - and to make you understand how and where the 
product feature is used, I have created a  
59:40 - small section over here on this page, okay, so 
you can see this for right sample, you're gonna  
59:45 - come over here okay. Now you can see two designs 
over here, okay, this is the mobile design. Now,  
59:50 - let me tell you where product is used. prototype 
is used to make interactive web designs. So I have  
59:57 - kept an example over here on this section. Okay. 
Perfect. sample. So now what I'm going to do is  
60:02 - I'm going to click over here, okay? For right like 
this. Now look, I already created some frames over  
60:07 - here, but I'm going to delete it. Okay? So 
I'm going to click it over here like this.  
60:12 - And I'm going to delete, and then I'm going 
to click over here and then delete. Okay,  
60:16 - so I'm starting, I'm starting from 
scratch in order to make, sorry.  
60:20 - So I'm starting from scratch, in order to make 
you understand how the system works. I mean,  
60:24 - the product how prototype works. So first of 
all, let's understand this model over here. Okay,  
60:29 - so this is our nav bar over here. And this is 
the hamburger menu icon over here. Okay, so the  
60:34 - moment we click this menu icon over here, okay, is 
gonna get converted to this cross sign over here,  
60:40 - and then this content over here will get vanished. 
And then it's going to show us our menu items over  
60:47 - here, like home teacher, so on and so forth, etc. 
In order to create a portrait, right, what you're  
60:52 - going to do is you're going to click over here, 
okay, this section for right like that, and you're  
60:56 - going to get this instructions over here. Okay, 
so the first thing that we're going to do is,  
61:02 - I'm going to select this, okay, by double 
clicking over here, like that, look at that,  
61:05 - I have selected this hamburger menu icon. Okay, so 
look at this, do you see this plus sign over here?  
61:12 - It means that the moment we click on here, or the 
moment we tap on here, where do we where will this  
61:20 - lead us to? Okay? It's going to lead us to this 
frame over here. I mean, this design over here,  
61:25 - okay, so I'm gonna click and drag this one like 
this, look at this arrow on my hand. Okay, I'm  
61:30 - going to drag it like this over here. There we go. 
So this is getting linked to this one over here.  
61:35 - All right, and then it's going to give me this 
option over here. So look at this interaction  
61:40 - details that popped up. Okay, so it's telling 
me it's asking me how this interaction should  
61:47 - take place. Okay, should it be on click or on 
drag, all while hovering while pressing, then  
61:54 - we have mouse and we have a lot of options over 
here to pick from what what For this tutorial,  
61:58 - I'm going to keep it very simple, okay? On click, 
which means that the moment we click this one  
62:03 - over here, then it is going to choose this frame 
over here, okay. And then we also need to click  
62:08 - over here, so that we can go back to this main 
content over here. So how do we do this, we're  
62:14 - going to do the same thing. Okay, we're going 
to double click over here on this cross site.  
62:17 - And then you see this little plus over here, let 
me zoom in, you see this little plus over here,  
62:22 - we're going to select that and drag it back to 
this main frame over here like this. Okay, that,  
62:27 - there we go. And there is also going to show 
me this interaction designs, I'm interaction  
62:31 - details. Okay, so what I'm going to do is, I'm 
going to keep it as it is, and then look at this  
62:36 - animation over here. So I'm going to click over 
here. So instead of instead, I'm going to select  
62:40 - dissolve over here like that. So you have a bunch 
of, I mean, a lot of options to choose from,  
62:45 - but I'm going to keep it very simple, just 
dissolve, okay, like that. And I'm going to select  
62:50 - this one as well. And I'm gonna set the animation 
to dissolve as well like that, look at that. Now  
62:54 - look, in order to test this prototype, what 
you have to do is you're going to click this  
62:58 - play button over here, do you see this play 
button over here. And when I click it like this,  
63:02 - now let's experiment, it's going to create a new 
window over here, okay? And there we go. Look  
63:07 - at this, our design is over here. I mean, this is 
our prototype over here, okay? Now, look at this,  
63:13 - look at my mouse over here, wherever, wherever I 
go, it is just a mouse, okay, but wherever, what  
63:20 - whenever I come over here, look at this is gonna 
turn into a pointer, which means that this is  
63:25 - clickable. If I click over here, then it's going 
to give me some animations or interactions. Okay,  
63:30 - now look, I'm gonna test it over here like this. 
Okay, I'm gonna click like this, look at that.  
63:34 - Look at that, we have our navigation menu 
items over here. And we also have this cost  
63:39 - center over here. Okay, I'm going to click 
over here again, like that, we're gonna,  
63:42 - it went back to our frame, main frame 
over here. Let's experiment again. Okay,  
63:47 - click like this. There we go. And then in order 
to go back to that, you see this animation,  
63:53 - this dissolve animation, look at that. It is 
just fading in fading out. I really hope that  
63:58 - you understood the product feature. If you want to 
experiment with the product, you're going to come  
64:02 - to this section over here the prototype sample 
and follow the instructions that I have given you.  
64:09 - Now we're going to discuss that with 
a feature called auto layout. Today,  
64:12 - I'm going to show you two use cases how to use the 
auto layout. First of all, I'm going to show you  
64:16 - how to align your content, this content over here, 
this text this text this button at the same time,  
64:23 - I'm going to show you how to make this button 
over here using the auto layout. So now you're  
64:26 - going to come over here like this, and we're 
going to create a new frame over here, okay,  
64:30 - so you hit F like this on your keyboard, okay, 
and then you're going to drag it like this. Look  
64:34 - at that. We have created ourselves a new frame. 
Okay, let me actually resize it a little bit.  
64:39 - Like this. Look at that. Okay, it looks 
quite good. And then now I'm going to create  
64:44 - a text Okay, so d and then I'm going to 
place it over here like this, okay, I'm  
64:47 - going to write something like this. And then I'm 
gonna set the size to let's say 60 pixels. Okay,  
64:52 - wait a minute. It's gonna work like now 16. There 
we go. And now I'm going to duplicate this. Okay,  
64:58 - let's say that I want to duplicate this 
to James, okay, I'm going to select the  
65:02 - keyboard named alt, okay? And then I'm 
going to drag it like this, look at that,  
65:07 - okay, it's gonna get copied, okay? Alt, and 
then use your mouse like this, look at that out,  
65:12 - and then mouse is gonna duplicate me the same 
thing. Okay, control Zed. Now, where is the oral  
65:18 - layout used? Let's say that this text are over 
here like this, look at that, okay, in this array,  
65:23 - let's say that I want to align them to the very 
left, or exact measurements, how what I mean,  
65:30 - look at this over here, you see this text, one, 
two, and then this button over here, you see,  
65:37 - all of these elements are aligned to this box, 
this blue colored box over here on the very left  
65:43 - on exact accurate measurements. So if we 
want to copy this layout over here like this,  
65:48 - then what we generally have to do is we have 
to individually select this element, okay? And  
65:52 - then we have to take the help of this guy's over 
here, do you see this orange color guide that is  
65:57 - showing me the number of gaps 57 pixels, okay? 
If I come over here, like this, look at this,  
66:03 - the orange color guide is getting highlighted. 
Okay, let me show you again. Okay, look at this,  
66:07 - okay, now look, this is on accurate, left, Align 
Left, okay. And then if I drag it over here,  
66:14 - like this, now look, it's gonna get aligned 
to the left, according to this size over here,  
66:18 - okay. And then let's say that I want to decrease 
the size over here, okay, I'm going to select  
66:22 - this like this, okay, I'm going to do it like 
this, and it got decreased reduced in size.  
66:27 - And let's say that I want to decrease it even 
further. Okay, I'm going to remove these letters  
66:31 - from here like this. Okay, now, let's say that I 
want to change the gap in between this content,  
66:36 - okay, it's gonna be a hassle, okay, you have to 
just individually take your mouse, and then you  
66:41 - have to place it like this. And if you want 
to calculate the space, what you have to do  
66:46 - is you're gonna click any element, let's say that 
I want to click this element, okay, this element,  
66:51 - and then I'm gonna select my Alt key on my 
keyboard like this. And then wherever I place,  
66:57 - my mouse is going to show me that calculation. 
Like look at this, the distance between these  
67:02 - two elements, okay, is 51 pixels, look at this 
orange color guide, it is highlighting 51 pixels.  
67:08 - Similarly, let's say that I want to select this 
and calculate the gap between these two content,  
67:13 - okay, I'm going to select out, and then I'm going 
to put a mouse on this content, look at this  
67:18 - 39 pixels. This is how it works. But it's 
gonna be a long hassle if you do it manually.  
67:24 - So in this case, what you can use is the auto 
layout. Okay, let me actually show you okay.  
67:29 - I'm going to click all of them together, and then 
I'm going to right click like this and look at  
67:33 - this option or add auto layout. Okay, I can do it 
over here like this, or do you see this option?  
67:41 - shortcut keys shift a, you can also press the 
shift n is going to work, okay? Like this,  
67:46 - look at that. Okay, now look, if I. 
So if you notice on the right side,  
67:50 - you see this new section over 
here, this is called oral now,  
67:53 - okay, if you want to remove the oral layout, 
then you're going to select this minus over here,  
67:58 - okay? And then it's going to remove it and convert 
it back to a frame. How do you know when it gets  
68:03 - converted to a frame? Okay, you're gonna actually 
you're gonna show you're gonna see on the right  
68:07 - side, okay, look at this, okay, this hashtag, 
this hashtag means the frame. Now, if you go  
68:12 - back by selecting control Zed like this, look 
at this over here, wait a minute, look at this,  
68:18 - we have two rows like this, I mean, two lines 
like this, this represents the auto layout. Okay,  
68:24 - now let's look at the options that we have. 
Okay, so I'm going to select this like this,  
68:29 - and it's going to highlight me that auto layout, 
okay, look at this, I have 45 pixels of gap in  
68:34 - between each of this content, okay? So if I 
drag my mouse like this limit, the amount of  
68:41 - gap in between this content changes, okay, like 
this, look at that, again, lowest is zero, and  
68:46 - upper limit is anything you wish, okay, like this, 
let's say I want to set it to 25 pixels like this,  
68:51 - look at that. And this one, look at this one, this 
is used to add padding around your continuity,  
68:56 - let me show you Okay, I'm going to select this 
and drag it like this, we're gonna look at this  
69:01 - padding is getting added all around my content 
like this, look at that, if we want to change  
69:05 - again, like this, look, padding is getting applied 
like that. Now let's talk about this feature over  
69:11 - here. padding and alignment. Okay. So if I, let's 
say that I want to increase my size of my content,  
69:17 - okay, like this, look at this. I'm gonna drag 
my blue colored box like this and it is gonna  
69:22 - increase in size. Let's say that I want to place 
a condom at the very center. How do I do this,  
69:27 - in order to do it quickly, easily efficiently, 
we're going to use this tool alignment and  
69:32 - panning, okay, and when I select like this, and 
look at this, I have so many options. I can select  
69:36 - it any I can place it anywhere I want. So our 
criteria is where to set it at the very center.  
69:42 - How do we do it? We're gonna click this over here, 
you see this over here, option. Look at that.  
69:47 - It got centered on our box over here. Okay, 
so let's say that I want to see like this,  
69:51 - I want to place it on this corner over here 
on this corner over here, we can do it.  
69:56 - So you're gonna see like this, like 
this, look at that. It's gonna get  
70:00 - Move to this section over here. And do you see 
this over here? This is the padding. This is used  
70:05 - to add padding. So remember this one, okay, let me 
actually change it to a default. Like that. There  
70:12 - we go. So if you remember, this is going to add 
padding to all four sides. But you don't want this  
70:18 - behavior, you just want to add padding to let's 
say that left and right, okay, in order to do it  
70:23 - manually, you're going to click this over here and 
using this option over here, you can manually add  
70:27 - padding over here. Let's say that I want to add 50 
pixels of padding to the left side. There we go,  
70:34 - boom, it's going to add padding to just to the 
left side. Okay, now let's say that now let's  
70:38 - say that I want to add padding to the top, okay? 
Top How much are let's say the 25 pixels, okay,  
70:43 - so I'm gonna come over here and write 25, like 
this, and hit enter. Now look, I have 25 pixels  
70:49 - of padding and the top 50 pixels of padding on the 
left, if you want to individually set the padding,  
70:54 - this tool is very helpful. Alright, then now let's 
experiment how to make a button using the auto  
71:00 - layout. Okay, so I'm going to delete this from 
here, okay, I'm going to make a button like this,  
71:03 - look at that, you see this button over here, I'm 
going to make it I mean, I'm going to duplicate  
71:07 - it. Okay, so I'm going to come over here, and the 
very first thing that I can do is I'm gonna write  
71:12 - text over here like this, okay, I'm gonna write 
after selecting T. And let me show you the steps,  
71:18 - okay, you're going to hit t on your keyboard, 
or you're going to select this over here, okay?  
71:22 - So t like this, and then and click over here on 
your screen, I mean, on your frame, again, you're  
71:27 - going to right button, bu TT o and like this 
button, okay? So, I'm going to convert this button  
71:34 - text to full capital letters. Okay, so I'm going 
to come over here like this, and I'm gonna select  
71:39 - this option over here. Okay, look at that. Now, 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to directly add,  
71:44 - I'm going to directly add or layout, look at this, 
okay, I'm going to right click over here and add  
71:50 - order lab, or what you can do is you can, you can 
click shift plus a like this look, shift and a,  
71:56 - now look, oral layout is added to our button. 
Okay, in order to see that, what you have to do  
72:00 - is we're going to click this over here, and then 
you see this field over here. I'm going to click  
72:04 - this over here like this, and I'm going to change 
the fill color to black, okay, 0000, like this,  
72:09 - and look at that, it got converted to very dark 
black. Okay, now, I'm going to come over here,  
72:16 - and then I'm going to select Ctrl on 
my keyboard, and then right click,  
72:20 - I'm in left, click over here, and then I'm going 
to select the text, okay, the text is selected, or  
72:25 - what you can do is you can come over here on this 
frame, okay, this frame gets highlighted in blue,  
72:30 - and then look at this frame, I mean, this oral 
layout frame, okay, and inside this frame,  
72:35 - we have the bottom, okay, you're going to click 
this over here, or you can directly control and  
72:40 - then left click over here, then is going to 
select the text, okay, and then you see this  
72:45 - color over here, I'm going to change it to white, 
okay, f f, f f, six times f, like this look,  
72:52 - is gonna bring back my buttons. Okay, now let's 
say that I want to add some padding to the left  
72:57 - and to the right side of one button. So how do I 
do this. And before doing that, what you have to  
73:02 - normally do is we have to select this over here, 
and then you have to select this, which means that  
73:07 - you want the text to be at the very center of 
your bottom. Otherwise, what happens is, if you  
73:11 - want to resize your button, let's say that I want 
to resize Mazzuca that the text is aligned to the  
73:18 - very left it is not moving, okay, if I resize it 
like this, look, it is not moving anywhere. Okay,  
73:23 - controls that control that. Now, if I set it to 
the very center like this, if I resize my model  
73:30 - anywhere, anyhow, wherever I wish, like that, look 
at it, this text will stay at the very center,  
73:36 - we're here like that, look at that, I can move it 
anywhere I want, okay, controls that. Now, let's  
73:42 - say that I want to individually add some padding, 
okay, I'm going to select over here. And then  
73:46 - let's say I want to select padding of 30 pixels 
on the left in the right, okay, 30 over here,  
73:53 - gap, I mean, enter 30 over here, hit enter like 
that, look at that, we have 10 pixels of padding,  
74:00 - your top bottom, and 30 pixels of padding on the 
left and right. Also, I'm going to show you how  
74:05 - you're going to utilize these two buttons over 
here to make responsive layout for your desktop,  
74:10 - tablet, mobile Web Designs more quickly 
and efficiently. So keep watching,  
74:16 - I hope you understood how to align your content 
and make buttons using the auto layout feature.  
74:21 - Now I'm going to show you this feature that is 
left to discuss this feature over here. Okay,  
74:25 - so this is the vertical direction and 
this is the horizontal direction. Okay,  
74:29 - I'm going to remove this real quick. And look at 
this over here. Do you see this layout over here?  
74:35 - Do you see these cards over here? How is this 
stacked? This is stacked on a horizontal line. And  
74:41 - if you see the mobile version, the mobile design 
Look at this. It is stacked vertically like this.  
74:47 - So how do we do this very quickly, easily and 
efficiently. Okay, so I'm going to come to this  
74:51 - Dexter version over here and then I'm going to 
copy this one to the right side. Okay. Or perhaps  
74:56 - let's say I want to copy this over here. Okay. 
Like that. I'm going to extend this like this,  
75:02 - okay? And then I'm going to click one time over 
here, okay? And then out, press the out button  
75:08 - on your keyboard, okay? like this and then drag 
it over here like this, look at that. Okay? So,  
75:13 - auto layout is also enabled on this one. Okay? If 
you see the right panel over here, you see this  
75:19 - orange, you see this auto layout is enabled, 
okay? Do you see this horizontal direction  
75:25 - it is enabled, which means that our cards will 
act like this, okay, it's going to act on the  
75:30 - horizontal line is gonna layout on the horizontal 
line, what you're saying that we want it to be  
75:36 - on the vertical line, which means that we 
want to make it for the mobile version. Okay,  
75:40 - what we're gonna do is, we're going to click 
it over here like this. Okay, boom, we made the  
75:45 - layout of workouts for the mobile version, look 
at that, how quickly I made it. So the mobile has  
75:51 - small screen. Okay, so I have to resize it like 
this. Let's say that, I'm going to come over here,  
75:56 - and then I'm going to hit the K. Or what you 
can do is you can come over here and then  
76:00 - select the scale version over here. Okay, I'm 
going to hit K over here, like this, and then  
76:06 - click this. And then I'm going to resize it like 
this, look at that. It got resized, if you want  
76:11 - to resize even further, according to your screen, 
which is normally small, like this, look at that.  
76:20 - You can, you can adjust the width and height 
accordingly to your needs, okay, like this, using  
76:27 - the scale isn't isn't the scale to now look at 
this side by side comparison how easy and quickly  
76:33 - I made layout from a mobile version from the 
desktop version. This is the desktop version over  
76:38 - here. And this is the mobile version over here, by 
the way to see the content inside this card, this  
76:44 - chemistry, this button over here, this image over 
here, all of them are using the auto layout. And I  
76:50 - have used auto layout to align the content at the 
very center. If I see if I select one card like  
76:57 - this, look at that. Okay, I have selected this 
card over here. So look at this content over here,  
77:02 - okay, if I come to this auto layout, look, all the 
content has 19 pixels of padding, I mean gaps in  
77:08 - between. And then if I select this one over here, 
then you can see that the content is aligned to  
77:13 - the very center like this, look at that, I really 
hope that you understood the auto layout feature.  
77:21 - The next feature that I want to talk about is 
the layout grid. So you can select any frame you  
77:25 - want across all these pages, either the desktop, 
tablet, mobile or anything, we are going to find  
77:31 - this frames, Okay, I'm gonna send the first one 
as an example. Okay. And then you're going to find  
77:35 - this over here, the layout grid. So when is this 
used, if you want to plan your content, I mean,  
77:41 - if you want to make a web design responsive for 
the next top, tablet, mobile, etc, you need to  
77:48 - plan your content, right? So using this, you can 
plan your content. Let me show you a demo. Okay,  
77:53 - so I'm gonna use the i button over here, I'm gonna 
click this, this is used to hide that layout,  
78:00 - okay, like this, look at that, okay, and this 
minus sign is used to delete that layout.  
78:05 - And this plus sign is used to add the layer, I 
mean, the layout grid, okay. So look at this,  
78:11 - what is written over here, five columns are okay, 
so if you count over here, 12345, we have five,  
78:18 - I mean, five grid columns, okay. So if you click 
over here, like this, now, what is this, this  
78:23 - didn't count, okay, you can increase the number of 
columns over here, you can also select the color  
78:29 - and then you can set the opacity over here like 
this as well. So I'm going to click over here  
78:34 - like this. And then look at this, we have this 
option on the columns, we can also change it to  
78:38 - grids like this, and you can see these little dots 
over here like a graph paper, okay? You see this?  
78:44 - thin lines like this, okay? This pattern, okay? 
And so this is the grid. Alright, so if you want  
78:50 - to change it to, let's say, columns, or sorry, 
rows, you can also do it like this. Look at that.  
78:55 - It changed from columns to rows like this. 
Now let's change it back to columns, okay,  
79:01 - like this. I'm going to click over here and then 
columns like this. Now look, how many columns  
79:05 - do we have? 12345, right. So look at this over 
here, we have five columns over here, and over  
79:10 - this margin over here, 50 pixels of margin. So if 
I zoom in over here, so look at this over here,  
79:15 - you see this first column over here, the gap 
between the first column and the start of our  
79:19 - screen over here is 50 pixels. This is the 
gap. I mean, this is the margin over here.  
79:24 - And regarding the gutter, we see we have 30 pixels 
of gutter over here, okay? Now look at this, this  
79:29 - is the gutter, okay? I mean, the space between the 
columns, okay, this is 30 pixels. Now, the best  
79:35 - example that I can give you at the moment is this 
one, wait a minute, this layout over here you see  
79:41 - this one over here offered courses. This has three 
cards, how many cards, three cards, which means  
79:47 - that we can stack them on three columns. Okay, 
let me show you a mess like this. And look at  
79:52 - this over here. Okay, I'm gonna and now I'm going 
to click this button over here to show you how the  
79:58 - layout grid is working. Okay, so look In this, 
how many layers? I mean, how many columns do we  
80:02 - have? We have three columns and three cards. Okay, 
so how many how much gap? Did I put between the?  
80:08 - I mean, how much margin did I put? Okay, so I can 
see it over here like this, okay? Look at this, we  
80:12 - have three columns. So it's gonna be highlighted 
three over here, and the color is this one red.  
80:18 - And this is used to change the transparency. Okay? 
So if I increase the size like this, look at that,  
80:22 - it gets much red. Okay, I'm going to change it to 
10% so that it is visible. I mean, both the layout  
80:30 - grid and content becomes visible, okay. 10% is a 
sweet spot. And we have margin of 77 pixels. Okay.  
80:37 - On the left and the right, and gutter, we have 
turned to pixels. A couple of seconds ago, I told  
80:42 - you that this layout grid is used to plan your 
content when you're making responsive websites,  
80:48 - I mean, Web Designs. Okay, let me show you a 
demo. Okay. This is the best example that I  
80:52 - can give you right now. So I'm going to click 
this over here. And look at this over here,  
80:56 - how many columns do we have? We have three columns 
over here with 77 pixels of margin on the left and  
81:02 - the right and then we have 32 pixels of gutter, 
okay? So this is, you see this gap over here.  
81:08 - Okay, white colored space between the red and our 
start off screen over here. This is 77 pixels of  
81:15 - margin, okay. And this gutter over here, you see 
this white color over here? This is 32 pixels.  
81:21 - This is the gutter. Okay? So this is the desktop 
layout. Okay, how many columns do we have? We have  
81:27 - three columns and three columns are stacking three 
cards. In case of the mobile layout, look at this,  
81:32 - okay, I'm going to click over here, this mobile 
on the page section and look at this, how many  
81:37 - columns Do we have, we have just one single column 
and this single column is stacking how many cards,  
81:43 - three cards because we have less space, less space 
on the mobile version? Okay, so I'm going to click  
81:50 - on this and then I'm going to inspect that layout 
grid. Okay. So I'm going to click over here. Now  
81:55 - look, how many columns do we have? We have just 
one single column. And how many margin Do we  
81:59 - have 20 pixels of margin. Now for zooming, look at 
this, this space over here is 20 pixels of margin.  
82:05 - Okay, and this is the mobile layout. If we 
want to add layout grid on your frame, what  
82:11 - you have to do is you're going to select F, okay, 
on your keyboard like this, and then you're gonna  
82:16 - drag it like this, look at this, we have a frame, 
okay, if you want to add that layout grid, you're  
82:20 - going to select this like this and look at this 
over here, you see this layout grid over here,  
82:23 - you're going to click this over here like this, 
the plus sign, okay, then it's going to add this  
82:28 - pattern over here. If you want to change it, 
then you're going to click this over here. And  
82:31 - then you're going to change it to columns or 
rows over here, according to your needs. Okay.  
82:37 - I hope you understood how to use the layout grid.  
82:41 - Alright, now I'm going to discuss about the 
constraints properly. Okay, in order to discuss  
82:45 - about the constraints provided, you're going to 
come to this section, I mean, this page over here,  
82:49 - responsive test. Okay, so you have noticed 
this before, okay, if you click any element  
82:55 - like this, then you're going to find this 
constraints property over here. I'm going  
82:58 - to discuss about this one. Okay. This is used to 
test whether your design is responsive or not.  
83:05 - So I use the constraints provided along with 
the plugin named breakpoints. Okay, this is a  
83:12 - plug in over here, I have actually included this 
section for you to test. So you're going to come  
83:17 - over here. Okay. So do you see this guy's over 
here? I'm going to zoom in a little bit. Okay.  
83:21 - I'm gonna come over here you see this. These 
are our breakpoints for one four pixel is the  
83:26 - breakpoint for the mobile version. Okay. 767 168 
pixels is the breakpoint for the tablet version.  
83:33 - This is the breakpoint for the laptop version. And 
this one is the Dexter version. Okay, now look,  
83:38 - what happens if I resize it? So I'm going to click 
this over here. Okay. look very carefully. Look at  
83:43 - this, the constraint property is working. When 
I resize the window like this, look at this,  
83:48 - our content is at the very center, we're here. 
Don't worry, we're going to recreate the results.  
83:54 - Okay, just look what happens. So when it comes to 
the tablet breakpoint, now look what happens. Now,  
84:00 - if I now if I cross the tablet break? Well, now 
what happens? Here is the tablet breakpoint. So  
84:05 - I'm going to cause the tablet breakpoint. Okay, 
like this, look at that. Look, our design changed  
84:10 - because the plugin named breakpoints, and if I 
resize it like this, now look what happens. We  
84:15 - have some gaps over here, okay, and the content 
is actually at the very center over here. So if  
84:19 - I resize it even further, now look what happens. 
The font size changes and the content increases in  
84:26 - size. Like that. Look at that. Let me actually 
resize it again. Okay, now look what happens  
84:30 - when that small large is the laptop. This is 
the tablet version. This is the laptop version,  
84:38 - tablet version, mobile version over here, mobile 
tablet, laptop, the constraint properties used  
84:46 - over here. Okay, I'm going to delete this over 
here real quick. Okay, so I'm gonna come over  
84:49 - here. Okay. Wait a minute. Now look at this. 
This is the design for the laptop version. This  
84:57 - is the tablet version over here and this 
one is the most Version over here. Okay,  
85:01 - so I'm gonna just focus on the mobile version over 
here like this, wait a minute, there we go. Okay,  
85:06 - so I'm gonna bring my options over here. And then 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all my  
85:11 - elements together, okay? Like this. And then I'm 
gonna group it together like this Ctrl G. Now,  
85:18 - if we select this one over here, and if 
you notice over here, now you see this,  
85:23 - this blue color is highlighted, and this one over 
here as well. This is the top and this one is the  
85:28 - left, okay, which means that if you resize the 
window like this, wait a minute, like this, then  
85:36 - what will happen is your content will be focused, 
your content will be locked on the left top, like  
85:42 - this, look at that. But let's say that you want 
it to be on the bottom. Right. So how will you  
85:48 - do this? control that Okay, I'm going to select 
this I mean, the entire content section and I'm  
85:54 - gonna select this one. Okay, bottom, right. Now 
look, what happens if I resize the window. Okay,  
85:59 - now, look, what happened is gonna stay focused. I 
mean, he's gonna stay fixed on the bottom, right?  
86:06 - Okay. Okay, now I'm going to select this 
one. And I'm gonna drag it down like this,  
86:10 - look at that. Our content is getting fixed on the 
bottom right. Now, let's say that I want it to be  
86:15 - on the bottom left, what will I do, I'm going to 
do the same thing, okay, I'm going to come to that  
86:19 - constraints property. Wait a minute, there's one, 
okay, then then I'm going to select a bottom left,  
86:25 - okay, I'm going to just click this over here, or 
what I can do, I can just click this overhead and  
86:31 - select the left option like this. Okay, and 
now look what happens, we resize the window,  
86:35 - I'm gonna drag this over here. Now look, 
it's gonna stay focused on the bottom left.  
86:42 - Like that. So in the case of testing my 
responsiveness of my Web Designs, what I do  
86:46 - is I'm gonna select all my content, and then I'm 
gonna center both horizontally and vertically like  
86:52 - this. Okay, now look, what happens if I resize 
the window like this, look at that. Okay, it stays  
86:59 - at the exact center like this. Okay, I 
do it for all my contents, wait a minute,  
87:03 - let me actually resize it. And I'm going to select 
all this content over here like this Ctrl G.  
87:10 - I have grouped them together, I'm 
going to select this and I'm gonna  
87:14 - enable this option. Okay, center center. Same 
thing for the version as well like this, okay,  
87:19 - Ctrl, G, and then center center like 
this. Now, there is a plugin named  
87:24 - breakpoints, okay, I'm going to right click over 
here and then select this plug in, okay, you  
87:27 - didn't have to do anything, just look what I do. 
Okay. And if you want to test it out, I'm going  
87:31 - to include this section over here, you're gonna 
come to this section, and then test it on your own  
87:36 - how the system works, okay, so I'm going to select 
this plugins option over here, and then I want to,  
87:41 - and then I'm going to select this breakpoints, 
like this. And there is going to give me this  
87:45 - little window over here. Okay, I'm going to 
select new adaptive layout like this. And then  
87:51 - I'm going to define a breakpoint over here, 
and I'm going to keep it over here as well.  
87:56 - And let me actually, alright, 
then, I'm going to select this one.  
88:01 - And then I'm going to right over here for one, 
four, which is the mobile display breakpoint,  
88:08 - okay, and then I'm going to right over 
here 768, which is the tablet screen,  
88:12 - and then I'm going to click this plus sign over 
here, okay, and then I'm going to right over here,  
88:15 - 1024 pixels, laughter version, and then plus over 
here, again, we're here 1440 pixels, 1440 pixels,  
88:22 - which is the Dexter version, okay, now look 
at this plus sign over here, I'm gonna click  
88:26 - this and I'm gonna select this mobile layout, like 
this plus sign over here, I'm going to select this  
88:32 - tablet version. Okay, I'm going to select this 
over here, and I'm gonna select this laptop as  
88:36 - well. Okay. Now, this is the result we got so far. 
Okay, now, this content is at the very center. If  
88:43 - I resize it, wait a minute, let's actually select 
this and then guess what happens? Look what  
88:47 - happens. Okay? Oh, I actually need to increase 
the width over here as well like this looking at  
88:54 - I mean height, I need to increase the 
height like this. Now look what happens  
88:57 - if I resize the window like this, we're gonna 
see the mobile version. Okay, this is the tablet  
89:05 - version. And this one is the laptop 
version. The constraints tool. And the  
89:10 - break point to both of them are very handy 
if you want to test out your responsiveness  
89:14 - of a web design. So I'm going to keep it as it is 
so that you can come and practice over here, okay.  
89:22 - Alright, now I'm going to talk about a tool 
called components. Okay? So look at this  
89:25 - over here, this footer over here. This is 
actually a component. Okay, we are gonna,  
89:30 - you and me together, we're going to change this 
social media icons with this one over here.  
89:35 - I'm going to come to this assets over here and 
look at this social media icons over here. Okay,  
89:40 - we're going to replace this. So we're going to 
replace this one with these ones over here. Okay,  
89:45 - but before that, let's actually test what does 
our components do? Okay, so I'm going to come  
89:50 - to the left side over here, and I'm going to 
draw a frame F and then like this, look at that.  
89:55 - Let's say that I'm going to write some dummy text 
over here Okay, like this. A B, C, D, okay? Ctrl  
90:02 - A and I'm going to change the size to let's say 
100 pixels, okay? Like this, look at that. Okay,  
90:06 - I'm going to change the font weight to regular. 
Okay? Now look what happens if I copy this to,  
90:13 - let's say three times, okay? This is the second 
time, this is the third time over here. Okay,  
90:19 - I'm going to zoom in a little bit like 
this. Now look what happens, let's say that  
90:25 - one of many benefits of the components function 
is that it helps you to stop repeating the same  
90:31 - design again, and again, they the day, the day 
and night difference between copying and pasting  
90:36 - the same thing and using the components, okay, 
let's say that I have copied and paste it three  
90:41 - times over here, okay, 123. Let's say that I want 
to remove the C, okay, I don't need the C. Okay,  
90:47 - so what so what I have to do is, I'm going to 
select this over here, and I'm going to remove the  
90:53 - C over here like this, okay? Same thing, I have 
to repeat how many times three times one time,  
90:58 - two time over here like this, okay, and 
three time over here like this, look at that.  
91:03 - But if I use a component that, wait 
a minute, let me actually remove this  
91:08 - from here. And I'm going to write ABCD 
over here, okay? If I right, oh, sorry.  
91:14 - Now, if I'm making a component, how to make a 
component, okay, I'm going to click this button  
91:19 - over here, create component, or what I can do is 
I can right click over here and create component  
91:24 - like this. Now, this is a component over here, you 
can see you can tell it vice, you can tell it by  
91:29 - looking at this icon over here. Or you can also 
you can also tell it by looking at this highlight  
91:34 - over here, a component is highlighted in purple 
color, okay? Now look what happens if I copy from  
91:40 - this component, okay? All and then click over here 
and then drag like this, okay? Now, look at this,  
91:48 - over here, look at my layers over here. This 
is a diamond shape, which means that this is  
91:52 - an instance of the parent component, this is the 
parent, this is an instance. Okay, I'm gonna do  
91:58 - it the same like this. Again, they say I want to 
do it more three times, okay, like this look at.  
92:04 - And let's say that I have to change it, I have to 
remove the C, what will I do, I have to remove it  
92:10 - six times, I have to do the same thing six times. 
But if I use a component like this one, now look  
92:14 - what happens if I remove the C from the parent 
component like this, look at that, I removed the  
92:19 - C, the C is removing all my six designs over here, 
look at that, by just changing this one over here,  
92:25 - and nothing else. Everything is changed. This is 
the main selling point of the components. Okay,  
92:30 - so I'm going to delete this from here. And 
look at this design over here. I will look  
92:34 - at my footer over here. This social media icon is 
it is blue in color, it doesn't go with our team.  
92:40 - If I come to our color palette over here, look at 
this. This is my color palette over here. Okay,  
92:46 - you can check the hex value over here as well 
look at this hex value and this hex value as well.  
92:52 - All right, no, this doesn't go with our color over 
here. This is blue color, light blue color. So I'm  
92:56 - going to change this to black and white. Okay, 
this one over here, this, if we come to this  
93:00 - assets over here, there's one Okay, now what I'm 
going to do is I'm going to click this frame over  
93:04 - here and then hit Alt on my keyboard like this, 
and then I'm going to drag it like this. Okay,  
93:09 - it's going to get copied, and then I'm going 
to right click, and then I'm going to select  
93:12 - this option over here, move page to Dexter. 
Okay, I'm going to come to text over here,  
93:17 - wait a minute, there we go, we have our 
design over here, you actually need to,  
93:21 - you actually need to zoom out a little bit 
so that you can see where the frame is.  
93:26 - Okay, like this, I got my frame over here. 
All right now. Now I'm gonna select this one,  
93:31 - this. Now I'm going to select this tutor 
option over here by double clicking over here,  
93:36 - and then double clicking again, like this. 
Now I can see the exact width and height of my  
93:42 - tutor over here. I went to the icon over here, 
this for 8.81 pixel. So I'm going to copy this  
93:48 - from here like this Ctrl C. And then what I'm 
going to do is I'm going to resize all of my  
93:55 - media icons, okay, like this, I'm gonna select 
this over here, and then I'm going to hit  
93:58 - cake on my keyboard, okay, like this, I 
can resize it like this, look at that.  
94:04 - Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna lock it over 
here, like this is the constraints property.  
94:09 - And then Ctrl V, if I paste it over here, then 
it then this value will automatically get applied  
94:15 - on my height over here as well. Okay, so I'm 
gonna select enter like this. Now look at that.  
94:22 - It gave me accurate calculations. So I'm 
going to drag it over here, wait a minute,  
94:27 - over here like this. By the way, this folder over 
here is the main parent component, okay? Which  
94:32 - means that if we change anything over here, then 
all the children that all the children components,  
94:39 - I mean, all the instances will get changed as 
well look at this, I placed the social media icon,  
94:44 - the Facebook, black and white over here on the 
parent component, and it got applied over here  
94:49 - on the children component. Same thing goes for 
all the children components as well look at  
94:54 - that. We have this Facebook icon over here. Now 
I'm going to delete this one over here. Okay,  
94:58 - the blue colored one. So what I'm going 
to do is I'm going to come over here,  
95:01 - and then I'm going to double click over here. 
And then I'm going to delete like this. So it  
95:06 - got removed. And same thing got removed from all 
the parent and children components as well look at  
95:11 - that, we'll have the social media icons over here. 
Same thing for all the footer instances. Okay,  
95:18 - so I'm going to come back over here, and I'm 
going to resize them also in a similar manner,  
95:22 - I'm going to hit K and then resize it like 
this, look at that. And then I'm going to hit  
95:27 - this constraints property. And then I'm going to 
paste the value that I have copied, okay, Ctrl V,  
95:32 - enter, look at that. So I'm going to select 
it together, and I'm going to drag it on here,  
95:39 - like this. Okay, now, what I'm going to do 
is I'm going to arrange a series like this.  
95:44 - And then I'm going to hit Shift plus a, after 
dragging, after selecting all this, okay,  
95:51 - like this, shift a, and then I can adjust the gap 
over here like this, let's say I want a gap of 10  
95:57 - pixels, okay? I change the mind, I'm gonna select 
it, like this, there we go. I can also change  
96:03 - the stroke as well. Okay, if I select Ctrl on my 
keyboard, and if I select this stroke over here,  
96:10 - like this, then it's gonna select me this, 
look at this, I'm going to change the to.  
96:16 - Okay, and I'm going to do the same thing 
over here, hit Ctrl on your keyboard,  
96:20 - and then hit Ctrl on your keyboard and select this  
96:23 - circle over here. And then change the to from 3.5 
to like this, look at that, it looks beautiful.  
96:30 - Double click over here and then follow the orange 
colored guides, okay? Look, our content is look,  
96:37 - our social media icons are aligned the left 
according to those texts over there. Okay,  
96:42 - now if I inspect all of my, let me actually delete 
this from here. Nine now if I inspect all of my  
96:49 - children instances, look at this, the same thing 
got applied over here, because that is because we  
96:55 - change the parent component. All children's, 
all children instances are bound to change.  
97:01 - Look at that, I really hope that you understood 
how to use this useful tool named components.  
97:09 - Congratulations, guys, we're done discussing 
all the essential tools of figma. Now we're  
97:13 - going to start making our web design for the 
desktop version. Let's get started. But the  
97:18 - first question is, how will we practice? Alright, 
then we're going to practice like this over here,  
97:22 - we're going to draw our frames, okay, like this. 
And then we're going to copy this design on our  
97:26 - practice case over here. As a beginner, this is 
completely fine to copy others works and designs  
97:32 - because this is part of the learning process. So 
I'm going to delete this one here like this. And  
97:36 - then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna move 
this to the right side, okay, and then I'm  
97:40 - going to draw a frame over here, like this, follow 
along with me, I'm gonna hold my shift, and then  
97:45 - I'm gonna select the names like this, okay, I will 
name the frame like this. Alright, and then I'm  
97:52 - going to select the fingers. And then I'm going to 
drag it over here like this. There we go. Now what  
97:55 - I'm going to do some zoom in over here, okay, 
whatever. This is my color palette over here.  
97:59 - I'm going to keep it over here. There we go. And 
then I'm going to make a frame over here. Okay,  
98:04 - so I'm gonna select my F, which is frame to locate 
F. And then I'm gonna select this over here, okay,  
98:11 - dekstop. And then this one dekstop, which has 
a dimension of 440 pixels in width, like this,  
98:19 - look at that. Okay, I'm going to keep it over here 
like this, the first thing that I'm going to do is  
98:22 - I'm going to make grid layouts. Okay? So what I'm 
going to do is I'm going to select this element  
98:26 - over here, okay? And then I'm gonna select this 
little icon over here, okay, so that I can see the  
98:31 - grids over here. And then I'm going to select this 
so that I can better see what is the margin and  
98:36 - what is the gutter over here, okay, you can see 
figure, we can see 50 pixels of margin over here.  
98:42 - But let's say that in certain scenarios, you 
cannot actually see how much is the margin over  
98:47 - here. So what will you do in this case, in this 
case, what you can do is, let me actually show  
98:51 - you a trick over here. So I'm going to come 
over here, okay, you see my text over here.  
98:56 - And this gap over here, I'm going to draw a 
rectangle over here, let me actually show you  
99:00 - Okay, I'm going to hit R. And then I'm going to 
draw a little rectangle over here, and I'm gonna  
99:04 - keep it over here like this, and it's gonna snap 
inside this, let me actually zoom in a little bit,  
99:08 - so that you can better see how this is working. 
All right, so look at this rectangle over here,  
99:12 - and then I'm gonna stretch it to this till this 
side over here, okay, like this, wait a minute,  
99:17 - like this, look at that this rectangle is filling 
that gap over here. Now if I select this over  
99:21 - here, and if I inspect this rectangle, you can 
see that this rectangle is 50 pixels in width,  
99:27 - which means that here is 50 pixels of gap. 
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to  
99:32 - remove this rectangle from here. Alright, then 
I'm going to come to my main design over here,  
99:36 - I'm in the practice case, and then I'm gonna give 
this one over here, auto layout grid, okay, like  
99:42 - this. And then I'm going to change it to columns 
like this, okay? And then I'm going to give here  
99:47 - how many pixels of margin 50 because we found out 
to the rectangle that it is 50 pixels of margin,  
99:53 - okay, like that. And let's actually see what 
we have specified in the grid like this. Okay.  
99:59 - And 30 pixels of gutter, Okay, there we go like 
that 30 pixels over here, if you hold shift and  
100:06 - up, if you hold shift and then press the up arrow 
bottom, then it's gonna change 10 scale at a time  
100:13 - like this look, it is 20 3040 5060 7080 while I'm 
holding the shift, but if you release the shift,  
100:20 - and if you use the arrow sign, I mean up arrow 
sign, then what do we have? This is gonna change  
100:25 - one pixel, one pixel like that is 80 pixels, okay? 
8180 280-384-8586 is gonna take a lot of time,  
100:32 - so I'm going to use the shift, okay, I'm going 
to jump to 36. And then I'm going to write 30.  
100:37 - We're here like this. There we go. Looks quite 
perfect. Now, now we're gonna make this navbar  
100:42 - over here. Okay, in order to inspect this

is set to black, I'm going to select this and f,  
110:39 - f, f, f six times, or three times, you 
can also read it three times f, f, f,  
110:44 - enter, look at that. We have white colored 
text inside our black colored button. So I'm  
110:49 - going to click this over here. And I'm 
going to set some border radius, okay?  
110:54 - I mean corner radius, let's say in pixels, 
okay, let's actually see the original one,  
110:58 - it is actually 18 pixels, okay, and width is this 
one. So I'm going to copy the width from here,  
111:03 - Ctrl C, and the height is 105 pixels, okay. And 
I'm going to paste it over here, look at that,  
111:09 - you cannot actually change it over here. But in 
this cases, what you can do is you can, you're  
111:14 - going to come over here and just drag it over 
here like this a little bit, a little bit, not too  
111:20 - much. And you can see this, it got unlocked, and 
the height is law. In order to unlock the type,  
111:26 - you're going to click over here like this, and 
you're going to drag it like this. Look at that,  
111:29 - the height and width, both of them got unlocked. 
Okay, so I'm going to pay the width over here.  
111:34 - Ctrl V, enter. Okay, don't worry, we're gonna 
change the properties, okay, and the height  
111:39 - should be, wait a minute, it should be I guess, 
70 to 105. Okay, we'll select this, and 105,  
111:46 - enter. Now, we need the text to be at the very 
center, do you remember this property over here,  
111:51 - this little icon, I'm gonna select this, and 
I'm gonna click this over here so that it gets  
111:56 - centered at the very middle, like this, 
look at both horizontally and vertically.  
112:01 - We got our solution over here. Alright, so 
I'm going to click the button over here,  
112:05 - and I'm going to right click, and I'm going to 
replicate another model. How do I do this? All on  
112:09 - your keyboard and drag it like this, look at that. 
And I'm gonna right over here, what? Come on,  
112:14 - tell me sign up. There's one. Okay. Wait a minute 
sign up. Okay, so always, always turn this one on.  
112:25 - So that extra whitespace gets reduced. And the 
bottom stays I'm in the bottom text remains at  
112:32 - the very center. Okay, so I'm going to click 
it over here again, so that this is enabled,  
112:37 - okay, all the width is enabled. So what this does 
is it removes all extra white spaces, so that your  
112:43 - button looks proportional aesthetic. So now look 
at this, even if we have a buttons like this,  
112:50 - what we're going to do is we're going to use our 
layout, okay, so I'm going to select both of them  
112:54 - together and shift plus a like this, look at that. 
Okay, and then I'm going to click this over here,  
112:59 - and then center over here like this, so that it 
always remains at the center. And look at this,  
113:04 - we also need to add some drop shadow to our 
buttons. How do we do this, I'm going to click  
113:08 - it over here like this, and look at FX over here. 
I'm gonna click it over here like this. Okay.  
113:13 - Now let's look at our original document, what is 
the priority of our effect the drop shadow effect,  
113:19 - okay, so I'm going to select this button over 
here like this, wait a minute, like this,  
113:23 - and then I'm going to select this drop shadow 
over here. So they set to 10. On the x, y is 10.  
113:29 - And the blur is four over here. Okay, so I'm going 
to come to this practice over here, and then I'm  
113:34 - gonna select the button, I'm gonna select this 
drop shadow, I'm going to say they will have 10  
113:38 - like this, the blur is four, that's fine. And for 
the wives should be 10, like this, there we go.  
113:43 - Now in order to transfer this blur radius to 
this button over here, instead of doing it again,  
113:48 - instead of repeating the same thing, what you're 
going to do is you're going to click over here,  
113:52 - double click over here, and then look at this, 
I'm going to double click over here, and then  
113:56 - I'm going to right click over here and then copy, 
paste. Okay, I'm going to copy the properties,  
114:01 - and I'm going to double click over here, and 
right click, and then I'm going to paste the  
114:04 - properties over here like this, look at that, 
I have successfully transferred the walk shadow  
114:09 - of the first button to the second button over 
here like that we're gonna, this is how the copy  
114:13 - paste properties works. Okay, so far, so good. Now 
let's look at the gap between the buttons on the  
114:18 - original document. Okay, so I'm gonna come over 
here. Now, instead of looking at the oral layout,  
114:23 - what you can do is you can just select this 
first second button over here, and then hold,  
114:28 - you hit all and wherever you place the mouse is 
going to show that distance between that button  
114:34 - and the element like let's look at that. I'm going 
to keep my mouse on the first button over here.  
114:40 - Let me show this to you again. Okay, so I'm going 
to double click over here and double click again,  
114:45 - or just hit Ctrl on your keyboard and then 
right click, left click sorry, like this. And  
114:53 - you're going to hit Alt on your keyboard, 
okay, and you're going to place your mouse  
114:57 - on the first button over here now, look at this. 
Let me actually zoom in, okay, look at this,  
115:01 - we have 53 pixels of gap between the first and 
the second button. So I'm going to come over here,  
115:07 - as you remember that we have enable oral layout on 
our buttons over here. So I'm going to click this  
115:12 - over here, and then I'm gonna come over here and 
write 53 pixels of gap, okay, five, three, enter,  
115:17 - like that. Now, regarding the gap between our text 
over here, and the text over here, I mean, the  
115:23 - first text and the second text, what you're going 
to do is you're going to do the same thing, okay,  
115:27 - I'm going to come over here like this, I'm going 
to Ctrl click like this, and then I'm going to hit  
115:32 - alt, on my keyboard, Alt, and then I'm gonna put 
my mouse on this second test, we're gonna, we have  
115:38 - 41 pixel, I can see 41 pixels of gap. So I'm going 
to come over here. And instead of doing manually,  
115:44 - just select both of them together like this, and 
shift plus a, and then you click this option.  
115:53 - And then you're going to do it like this. 
Okay, you're gonna keep it in the middle,  
115:56 - middle left, like that. Okay, so how much was the 
gap again? 41. Right? So I'm gonna come over here.  
116:02 - And do you see this option after clicking this 
41, fix it like that. 41, enter, there we go.  
116:07 - Now let's look at the difference, I mean, the 
distance between the buttons and the text,  
116:11 - okay, I'm going to select this button 
over here. And then same process, okay,  
116:15 - all on your keyboard, and then select that text 
over here like this, we've got 41 pixels as well.  
116:22 - So I'm going to come over here. And I'm going to 
select this and a button like this, look at that,  
116:27 - and then shift plus a, now I'm going to write 
41. Over here. And there we go. Look at that,  
116:34 - we have successfully copied the design, from the 
main design to our practice case over here. Now we  
116:42 - actually need to align our content according 
to these gaps and various properties, right,  
116:47 - so I'm going to click on here, okay, this block 
over here, and then I'm gonna click Alt on my  
116:53 - keyboard, same process, right, so I'm gonna keep 
the mouse at the bottom so that I can see the gap  
116:58 - between my screen and the content, we're gonna it 
is 109 pixels over here, you see this 109 pixels.  
117:05 - So I'm gonna come back over here, click this and 
Alt, I'm going to hit Alt on my keyboard, and then  
117:10 - I'm going to put my mouse over here like this, 
look at that this is 200,000 pixels of gap between  
117:16 - this corner I'm in this window, and this content 
over here. Okay, so what was the original one,  
117:23 - it was 109. So what I'm gonna do is I'm
