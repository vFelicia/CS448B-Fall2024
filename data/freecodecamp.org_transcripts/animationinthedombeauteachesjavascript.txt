00:00 - you can animate elements in the dom with
00:03 - css or javascript
00:05 - this video is going to show how to
00:06 - animate dom elements using javascript
00:09 - without any frameworks
00:11 - first i will show you how to create an
00:13 - animation by programming gradual changes
00:15 - in an element style
00:17 - then i will talk about the new
00:19 - element.animate method to make animation
00:22 - possible the animated element must be
00:24 - animated relative to a parent container
00:27 - the parent must use relative positioning
00:29 - while the animated element must use
00:31 - absolute positioning
00:33 - so if you see up here we have the
00:35 - container my container and then we have
00:38 - the child element the my animation
00:40 - that's what the code is going to animate
00:42 - and if you see here
00:44 - we have the container that has the
00:46 - relative positioning and we have the
00:49 - my animation that has the absolute
00:51 - positioning
00:52 - we can use a timer to call gradual
00:54 - changes in an element style and when the
00:57 - timer's interval is small the animation
01:00 - looks continuous so let's look at the
01:02 - code
01:03 - so you can see when this button is
01:04 - clicked it calls the mymove function
01:06 - which is right down here
01:08 - so we're going to get the element by id
01:09 - get my animation and assign it to
01:11 - element and then we're gonna set the
01:13 - position to zero
01:15 - and then we're gonna start this set
01:16 - interval and we're gonna pass in
01:19 - the frame function that we're gonna run
01:21 - and we're gonna run this function every
01:24 - 10 milliseconds
01:26 - and we're going to assign this to id
01:28 - that's so we can stop the interval when
01:30 - we need to
01:31 - so in the frame function
01:34 - if position equals 350 that just means
01:37 - that the square is at the end of the the
01:39 - ba the box here
01:41 - let's put that at the beginning
01:43 - so if the square is at the end of the
01:44 - box we're going to clear in a interval
01:46 - and we pass in the id that's up here
01:49 - that just means we're going to stop
01:50 - running this function we're going to
01:52 - stop running the frame function every 10
01:54 - milliseconds
01:55 - else we're going to move it so we're
01:58 - going to increment the position from
01:59 - zero to one
02:01 - and then we're going to to set
02:03 - the the top
02:05 - and the left style
02:07 - to the position the first will be one
02:09 - pixel two pixels three pixels four
02:11 - pixels five pixels just like that and
02:14 - then it's just going to animate across
02:16 - the screen
02:19 - and you can easily use different style
02:21 - elements instead of using top and left
02:24 - you can use the color you can use size
02:28 - any css element you can animate using
02:30 - this method
02:32 - now i'm going to show you a different
02:33 - way to animate using the element.animate
02:37 - method which is part of the web
02:39 - animations api
02:40 - and this method is actually the
02:42 - animation method with the best
02:44 - performance so let me paste in the code
02:46 - here
02:48 - now this is currently only supported in
02:51 - newer versions of chrome firefox and
02:54 - opera however there is a polyfill that
02:57 - you can use to add support for most
02:59 - other browsers
03:00 - check the description for a link to the
03:02 - polyfill and then you'll be able to use
03:04 - this all the time
03:05 - so this is going to animate the div item
03:08 - so i need to add the dip item to the
03:09 - html
03:11 - okay so here's the div with the id item
03:14 - and in the css i've already added some
03:16 - css uh it's going to start with the
03:19 - background blue position absolute and
03:21 - then the height width and the margin is
03:23 - just going to make it so it centers
03:25 - right in the the square
03:27 - so oh you can see the animation
03:29 - happening right now now let's go over
03:31 - the code that shows how this animation
03:33 - is created
03:35 - so first we get the item the get item by
03:37 - id item so that's that div and then
03:40 - we're going to call item.animate
03:43 - into the animate function we're going to
03:45 - pass two things
03:47 - this first thing we pass in
03:49 - is the keyframes
03:51 - so this is just an object formatted to
03:53 - represent a set of keyframes
03:56 - and then the second thing we're going to
03:58 - pass in is right here which is the
04:00 - options
04:02 - so let's look at the keyframes in the
04:04 - keyframes the it's just going to go from
04:06 - one keyframe to the next so in this
04:09 - first keyframe it's going to
04:12 - set the transform we're going to set the
04:14 - scale to one that's just a hundred
04:15 - percent so we're not actually doing
04:17 - anything for that
04:19 - and then we are going to set the
04:20 - background to red that's how we started
04:23 - and then the opacity to one which is a
04:26 - hundred percent so the first keyframe is
04:29 - basically just how we started
04:31 - now the second keyframe here what's
04:34 - going on to the next line let's pop this
04:35 - over a little bit the second keyframe
04:37 - we're going to do a transform have the
04:39 - scale go to 0.5 so 50
04:42 - size we're going to rotate it 270
04:44 - degrees
04:45 - set the background to blue and the
04:47 - opacity to 0.5 or 50 percent so it's
04:50 - going to
04:51 - animate between this keyframe and this
04:55 - keyframe
04:56 - and now the offset is optional if you
04:59 - don't have offsets it will evenly
05:01 - distribute each
05:03 - keyframe within the duration but if you
05:06 - have offsets then it won't be equally
05:09 - distributed so since i have 0.2 here
05:12 - it's going to go from the first keyframe
05:14 - to the second keyframe and 20 of the
05:17 - time and then it'll take 70 percent of
05:19 - the time to go to offset 1.
05:22 - the offsets on the keyframe have to be
05:25 - in numerical order so you have zero
05:27 - point two and one it always ends with
05:30 - one if we change that to um point five
05:34 - you'll see the animation will be
05:36 - slightly different
05:39 - so it's just the first part of it is
05:40 - going to take
05:42 - um half half the the time instead of
05:44 - just the 20 of the time so you can see
05:47 - the last key frame we put the scale back
05:50 - to one we rotate it to zero degrees
05:53 - and set the background back to red
05:54 - opacity back to red
05:56 - so for the options we have you set the
05:59 - duration in milliseconds so that's two
06:01 - seconds the easing
06:04 - we can change this to something like
06:06 - linear
06:09 - and let's see what that's going to look
06:10 - like
06:12 - so here it's not going to
06:14 - change speed as much between the
06:17 - different keyframes and then the delay
06:20 - is just how long it waits before the
06:23 - animation runs
06:24 - after the page loads and iterations
06:28 - we're going to keep going on forever but
06:29 - you can just make it go like two or
06:31 - three iterations
06:32 - direction it's going to alternate so
06:35 - that's why it keeps changing the
06:37 - direction that's spinning but if we put
06:40 - normal here and we run that
06:45 - now you can see it'll just always keep
06:46 - going the same direction and if you hit
06:49 - if you put reverse here will always go
06:51 - the other direction
06:53 - now all these options are optional and
06:57 - this fill here this fill is going to
07:00 - dictate whether the animation's effects
07:02 - should be reflected by the element prior
07:05 - to playing which would be backwards or
07:08 - it should be retained after the
07:10 - animation is completed playing which is
07:13 - forwards or you could put both and one
07:15 - thing to know about the keyframes up
07:17 - here is that you can animate pretty much
07:20 - any css property so transform background
07:24 - opacity these are all css properties and
07:27 - you can put different ones there to
07:28 - animate different properties
07:31 - so that's animation thanks for watching
07:34 - my name is beau carnes don't forget to

07:39 - good
