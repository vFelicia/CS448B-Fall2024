00:00 - together one
00:02 - life
00:04 - [Music]
00:32 - look at that some
00:33 - compassion to make
00:35 - the thing is that i want to really learn
00:37 - spanish but getting used to having a
00:40 - choice getting used to the remote work
00:42 - to
00:44 - being
00:44 - independent from you know traffic jams
00:48 - plus being most effective during morning
00:51 - hours
00:52 - these two things made me think that okay
00:55 - after some short experiment of going to
00:59 - these classes
01:01 - and having the spanish classes five
01:03 - times a week i can do it more
01:05 - effectively one day from this public
01:08 - course to which i'm going
01:10 - will give me like almost one week all
01:14 - the effective classes uh at home that
01:16 - will show uh i didn't resign from this
01:19 - public course at all so i got a chance
01:22 - to come back there
01:23 - i know what i'm missing i know
01:25 - what methods to use in order to learn i
01:28 - got tons of materials at home and online
01:30 - that i can use
01:32 - the thing is that i have to be
01:36 - i have to be systematic as with learning
01:38 - coding designs spanish is important for
01:41 - me but it's not the priority the
01:43 - priority right now is learning to code
01:45 - everybody has got just
01:48 - one
01:49 - one life
01:50 - and everybody has the same 24 hours so
01:53 - the thing the thing is how you manage
01:55 - the time the thing is how you spend it
01:57 - self-awareness is cool and knowing your
01:59 - flaws knowing your energy close is
02:01 - really important to learn more
02:03 - effectively and if you don't know your
02:06 - priorities and you take the life as it
02:08 - comes
02:12 - you
02:14 - don't use
02:16 - it
02:17 - wisely i prefer being aware i prefer
02:20 - choosing on my own and conducting some
02:22 - experiments not being afraid to
02:25 - change the decision and try something
02:27 - new
02:28 - if it goes
02:29 - with my priorities if it's okay with
02:32 - what i'm going to achieve
02:34 - in life
02:35 - it's tuesday i'm researching how to
02:37 - present the design section
02:39 - and
02:40 - i've discovered that the project that i
02:42 - wanted to show
02:44 - uh already has some problems it seems
02:47 - that the api has been changed this is
02:50 - the minus when designing stuff and
02:53 - implementing the code that's connected
02:55 - with the api that does not belong to you
02:58 - all of a sudden it can change and you
03:01 - gotta change your code
03:03 - it's wednesday i want to show my design
03:06 - skills in the portfolio
03:08 - but i'm not sure how to do it it was the
03:11 - best way which projects to choose how to
03:13 - describe them
03:14 - some of them i cannot show and this is
03:17 - the problem when you have mba and you
03:19 - did something for a class you're proud
03:20 - of but you cannot show it
03:22 - so
03:24 - [Music]
03:26 - so i'm wondering how to do it and what
03:28 - to show so
03:31 - no idea right now maybe it will come
03:33 - with the day the later during the day
03:36 - during the meetings
03:38 - let's see
03:43 - [Music]
04:10 - an hour and a half i got a meeting in
04:12 - the center it would be the meeting with
04:14 - another free called camper but she's
04:16 - from sevilla and she is on her trip to
04:19 - malaga that's why we decided to meet so
04:21 - talk about our code and revise a little
04:23 - bit
04:25 - and
04:26 - the second video that i'm going to have
04:28 - today is with the product designer i
04:30 - hope to show him also a bit on my
04:32 - portfolio and to ask about some advice
04:35 - the main reason that
04:36 - that we are meeting for is to discuss
04:39 - his talk
04:41 - during the front and malaga the meetup
04:43 - is focused on front-end and design and
04:45 - since he has a lot of experience i hope
04:48 - he would share it with the rest of the
04:50 - community
04:52 - [Music]
05:14 - it's wednesday in the evening i just
05:16 - came back from the two meetings that i
05:18 - had the first one was with a free code
05:21 - camper
05:22 - from sevilla we were revising our code
05:24 - and we were discussing our design and
05:28 - learning from ourselves so i
05:29 - i got discovered few things from d3
05:32 - today and
05:34 - javascript it was really awesome meeting
05:36 - really productive one i learned a lot
05:39 - the second meeting i had it was really
05:41 - motivating when it comes to the person
05:43 - and the story and his experience uh he
05:46 - is the designer and with about 20 years
05:50 - of experience and i really enjoyed this
05:52 - meeting because of many aspects and he
05:55 - uh he motivated me a lot to learn design
05:58 - and
05:59 - to try harder and this was really very
06:02 - awesome
06:03 - and
06:05 - meeting the people who are also doers
06:08 - meeting the people who
06:09 - have that interesting story to share and
06:11 - who
06:12 - try hard to develop to
06:15 - to live real life and to to do a lot of
06:18 - stuff not just only to spend their life
06:20 - passively it's really motivating
06:22 - visualizing your goals helps and
06:25 - if you
06:27 - see the people who who were on the same
06:30 - path but few years ago or who are
06:33 - at the same path right now
06:35 - it's um
06:36 - it can be motivating it can be inspiring
06:38 - you can learn a lot and you can
06:41 - take the energy from it
06:43 - for your fight one more take away if
06:46 - you're watching this but you are the
06:47 - person with a lot of experience who can
06:50 - share their story the struggles they had
06:52 - do not hesitate to share it you choose
06:55 - the form it may be the article maybe the
06:57 - video it may be that post it
06:59 - whatever you want sharing is
07:02 - something awesome you don't have to do
07:04 - it nobody will
07:06 - make you do it
07:07 - but it
07:08 - it can help so many people
07:17 - thursday
07:18 - i won't have too much time today to work
07:20 - on the code itself but
07:22 - i decided to
07:24 - work on the
07:26 - materials and the content for the design
07:28 - section and for sure we are iterating
07:30 - over it and changing the projects adding
07:32 - the staff
07:34 - with time so i will use the time that i
07:36 - have today
07:37 - for creating the content there for
07:41 - taking out the best example of recording
07:44 - some movies for
07:46 - deciding how to tell the story and what
07:49 - to focus on
07:50 - it's friday
07:56 - i'm doing cross browser testing and
08:00 - checking also the page on various
08:01 - devices
08:07 - it's saturday in the evening this is how
08:09 - the page looks right now so i introduced
08:12 - smooth scrolling
08:15 - working on portfolio sections
08:18 - i introduced also new mob mockups
08:22 - it's easier to focus on the design right
08:24 - now
08:26 - the page is available at the one who
08:28 - does uh right now
08:30 - i still need to introduce some changes
08:32 - like add the designer in terms of the
08:34 - design cases i'm working on i want to
08:36 - correct a bit
08:38 - the routines here i will also need to
08:42 - run the speed test and optimize the the
08:45 - images and generally the css javascript
08:49 - and things like that and what i did this
08:52 - week was
08:53 - testing
08:54 - for only the page and fixing some bugs
08:57 - this week i also had two
09:00 - mega inspiring meetings and
09:02 - i was revising the code of my previous
09:04 - project
09:05 - doing some small changes learning that
09:08 - basic stuff like the beginnings
09:10 - during this meeting
09:12 - of d3 and
09:14 - how how i should start with it next week
09:16 - i'm going to analyze the state machine
09:18 - and how it works because it seems to be
09:20 - pretty useful and for understanding the
09:22 - state and programming the logic
09:25 - in various apps i will be also working
09:27 - on the next stage of the design project
09:29 - i can show you that but it will take me
09:33 - some time but hopefully i will also
09:34 - learn something new
09:36 - and i will be able to share it with you
09:43 - keep on doing and see you next week
