00:08 - hey everybody its Jesse and I hope
00:13 - everyone had a nice weekend I had a
00:15 - little bit of a long weekend had Monday
00:18 - off so far there's no stream yesterday
00:22 - let's see today I'm gonna try something
00:25 - a little bit different so as you know if
00:30 - you've ever watched this before I only
00:34 - show my screen and so no one ever gets
00:39 - to see my face so I thought today I
00:43 - would have two streams so the first
00:46 - stream is just going to be the normal
00:48 - stream that that you all are used to and
00:51 - then the second stream is going to be
00:54 - the opposite view so you'll get to see
00:57 - my face as I'm doing this stream in that
01:02 - stream is going to be on Instagram so I
01:06 - could have done it like a little box on
01:09 - the side of the screen but for a couple
01:15 - reasons I decided enough to do that the
01:16 - most important reason being I don't
01:18 - really know how to do that and I didn't
01:20 - have time to look it up so right now I'm
01:24 - still rushing to finish as much as I can
01:27 - on this project by I think tomorrow is
01:30 - the last day that I can work on it so I
01:33 - spent a long time over the weekend I
01:35 - think Friday
01:37 - I stayed up pretty late on Friday
01:41 - working on this and did some work on it
01:43 - on Saturday so if you check out the live
01:46 - version of this site at catechetical
01:48 - Scone it's going to be a little bit
01:53 - different it won't look that different
01:55 - to you all since you've been seeing the
01:56 - development version of it but it's been
02:00 - a while since the the production version
02:03 - you know at the actual URL has been
02:06 - updated so so that's all updated and oh
02:10 - I'll fill you in on some of the changes
02:12 - that might
02:13 - then that were different that weren't
02:17 - even on the dev server I did make a few
02:19 - changes like that
02:23 - hey I just checked a lot hey everyone Oh
02:26 - Andrew sorry you can't you can't be with
02:30 - us in the live chat totally understand
02:32 - about work so andrew has to work so
02:34 - can't be in the in the live chat but
02:36 - hopefully you can you can catch the the
02:40 - live streams later in the week so okay
02:46 - all right the analytics were a little
02:48 - bit weird it was showing that I only
02:49 - have three viewers for a few minutes now
02:51 - I'm up to my normal right around 50 is
02:54 - pretty normal especially for the
02:56 - beginning occasionally I'll get more
02:59 - than that not sure why it probably just
03:03 - depends on who retweets the the tweet
03:05 - saying that I'm gonna I'm gonna stream
03:08 - and how many people that goes out to but
03:12 - anyway oh I I was mentioning I'm gonna
03:16 - have the second stream showing my face
03:21 - as I'm coding on Instagram and my
03:24 - Instagram account is its public so
03:26 - anybody can look at it it's just Jesse
03:28 - dot whyville so Jes se period WEEI GTL
03:33 - and I'll type that in the live chat if
03:35 - anybody's interested so I don't really
03:37 - know if anybody is interested but it'll
03:40 - give me a good idea I guess if I should
03:43 - look up and try to figure out how to put
03:45 - my face in a little box on the corner of
03:47 - the screen if nobody really cares then I
03:51 - won't worry about doing it but I had
03:53 - never done the live stream on Instagram
03:55 - before though so I thought this would be
03:57 - a cool way to try that out at the same
04:00 - time that I'm doing this so so anyway I
04:06 - just typed my Instagram name in the live
04:12 - chat there in case anyone's interested
04:16 - and I'm not even sure I'm not exactly
04:19 - sure how the UI and everything works for
04:23 - for Instagram live anyway so alright
04:28 - looks like some you saying don't worry
04:29 - about that don't need to see to see the
04:31 - face better to code that's what I always
04:33 - thought that's why I never bothered with
04:35 - it
04:36 - but then I see like a lot of other
04:38 - people who stream even streaming code
04:41 - also they have their face in there so I
04:43 - didn't know if that was that was the
04:45 - thing to do or what but I always just
04:47 - figured it's better to have the screen
04:48 - space for the code but you never know
04:53 - maybe people people like that so it's
04:55 - available if you want but it's on a
04:58 - separate stream so if you don't want it
05:00 - you don't have to see it okay so let me
05:02 - go through just a few of the the changes
05:06 - that I've made over the weekend and then
05:08 - we're going to get into just continuing
05:11 - to do some refactoring just like we had
05:13 - done on Friday we're just kind of gonna
05:14 - keep going through and clean things up a
05:18 - bit and bring in as much as we can from
05:21 - the WordPress API so that you know
05:26 - everything everything that should be
05:31 - editable will be editable from WordPress
05:34 - I didn't run into a problem just two
05:38 - minutes before I started the stream I'm
05:40 - trying to you know I'm using advanced
05:42 - custom fields in WordPress so let's see
05:50 - I'm gonna show you I'll show you what's
05:52 - happening and then maybe so if you look
05:57 - at this this is the the program info
06:01 - fields now we we created a field I think
06:04 - I did this on the stream last I'm
06:05 - actually created a field for URL and now
06:08 - it's not showing up because when I tried
06:10 - to add a field it came up with an error
06:14 - and then when I went back into this it
06:17 - had totally erased all the field so now
06:19 - I'm afraid to go into any of them to
06:20 - have all the fields erased
06:21 - luckily this section this courses
06:25 - section is not live yet so I know we we
06:31 - had made it so that you could import
06:34 - this would all be imported from
06:35 - wordpress but i didn't want to put this
06:37 - live with all the other stuff because i
06:40 - didn't have all this data ready yet and
06:42 - i hadn't actually tested it at all other
06:45 - than just went through it a bit in the
06:48 - live stream so for right now i'm gonna
06:52 - refresh but it still seems like it's it
06:55 - was working somewhat oh here we go no
06:58 - it's not
06:58 - so if you notice when there's a URL it's
07:02 - supposed to show a link like a little
07:07 - button to learn more so it's not so we
07:10 - basically lost we've lost that data now
07:13 - so I'm afraid to go into any other of
07:16 - these these fields and try to change
07:21 - anything because I don't want to get
07:23 - that error I don't want to have
07:24 - everything erase that would be that'd be
07:27 - pretty bad I do have a backup of the
07:29 - site so I backed up the site and then I
07:32 - upgraded WordPress and I upgraded some
07:34 - plugins that are were unrelated to this
07:38 - so I'm thinking that something with the
07:40 - update has messed up what's going on
07:44 - with this plug-in so I'm gonna try to
07:47 - recreate the area here so you all can
07:49 - see it plus I didn't really have a
07:52 - chance to look at it that well myself
07:54 - since it happened
07:55 - you're right before I had to start the
07:56 - stream so let's just type in URL and
08:01 - that's I'm not gonna type in explanation
08:09 - now cuz it probably won't even work but
08:11 - let's add this see if it works for us
08:14 - okay so here's the air that we're
08:17 - getting so it's saying
08:23 - so it's in the advanced custom fields
08:25 - plugin
08:35 - see
08:40 - so I'm not exactly sure what the problem
08:44 - is and as you like I'm pretty sure I've
08:49 - said this before I'm not really great
08:50 - with PHP so I'd rather not have to dig
08:52 - into this to figure out what the problem
08:56 - is
09:06 - so for now I think I'm just gonna leave
09:09 - that since it's not on affecting the
09:12 - live version of the site right now at
09:16 - least I I sincerely hope it hasn't
09:18 - erased all the data we should probably
09:20 - should check it just to be sure let's
09:26 - see let's bring this up let's try to
09:35 - find some place that would have alright
09:37 - so the resources would definitely have a
09:39 - lot of custom fields ok so the
09:48 - categories are by default WordPress that
09:50 - shouldn't be a big deal but these are
09:55 - okay alright so luckily this it hasn't
10:00 - erased everything so what I'm thinking
10:01 - would happen is if I actually went in
10:03 - and tried to change any of other custom
10:05 - fields in WordPress then it would erase
10:10 - those as well so I'm gonna just gonna
10:11 - leave this alone for now I'm gonna leave
10:13 - this up on the screen I'm just gonna
10:15 - move it over to the side and check that
10:18 - out later on and try to figure that out
10:21 - cuz I expect it's just gonna be a lot of
10:23 - me googling things and I don't know
10:27 - probably just commenting out lines of
10:28 - PHP and so I figure out what the problem
10:31 - is so that's that's not really gonna be
10:34 - great great to watch but if anyone has
10:40 - experience with advanced custom fields
10:42 - with that plug-in and it seen anything
10:45 - like that if you have any suggestions
10:47 - let me know alright hey we got somebody
10:52 - in the in the live stream on Instagram
10:57 - so awesome so thanks thanks for check it
11:03 - out I wondered if anybody would check it
11:04 - out said one person also I realize it
11:06 - may not be it may not be easy to get the
11:11 - Instagram live stream right now
11:13 - depending on you'll where you're at what
11:15 - device you're watching this on obviously
11:17 - if you're watching
11:19 - the the coding stream on your phone
11:22 - you're not going to be able to watch
11:23 - another stream on Instagram Instagram at
11:25 - the same time I'm gonna check the live
11:33 - chat quickly since I haven't checked it
11:37 - okay so Patrick says what some streams
11:40 - with the face even though it gets in the
11:42 - way either way it's fine
11:43 - okay so it seems like the at least from
11:49 - the people who have put in their opinion
11:52 - it seems like that you all do agree that
11:55 - the seeing someone's face just gets in
11:59 - the way of the code anyway so so we'll
12:02 - see maybe I'll do it again maybe I won't
12:08 - so our nod seems to be very upset about
12:14 - the face thing so so don't worry about
12:22 - it or not just don't don't look at my
12:24 - Instagram
12:30 - vasya asks about the deadline for this
12:32 - project yeah the deadline the for-sure
12:35 - deadline this time I know there have
12:36 - been multiple deadlines that have kind
12:38 - of been like pushed back a little bit
12:41 - that's how it goes sometimes you know
12:44 - you you think you have a really hard
12:46 - deadline and ends up not being like that
12:48 - but the real deadline is I think I have
12:51 - today and tomorrow to work on this and
12:54 - then I'm done then I'm gonna start a
12:56 - different project so Wednesday the
12:58 - stream should probably it'll probably
13:00 - end up being whatever the new project is
13:02 - that I'm working on so okay Andrews
13:10 - asking for me to post the the PHP error
13:13 - and this is Andrew Ritter so I know
13:15 - there's another Andrew that frequently
13:17 - is on here but he could be in the stream
13:19 - today so I'm posting everything it's
13:22 - right now in the live chat oops
13:27 - it's too many I'm gonna have to break it
13:29 - up it was too many characters there's a
13:33 - two hundred character limit for posting
13:37 - in the live chat so there we go so the
13:40 - first part fits the second part I think
13:45 - the second part of the air is going to
13:47 - be too long
13:49 - yeah it's too long I'll have to break it
13:51 - up which is gonna make it a lot harder
13:54 - to read but I guess that's how it will
13:58 - have to be for nah Wow okay so I'm gonna
14:05 - grab I'll put it up on the screen just
14:07 - for a second - so I'll just grab I can't
14:17 - I want to grab all this but it's it's
14:19 - over 200 characters so I guess I'm just
14:21 - gonna have to do it maybe three parts
14:22 - then
14:29 - Jools saying you spaceman yeah I could
14:36 - let's just do a paste yeah let me let me
14:48 - get this out I'm not I'm not really that
14:50 - worried about it for the stream so I
14:52 - don't really want to take up all the
14:56 - stream time over this error
14:57 - I mean if worse comes to worst and I
15:02 - can't use this i could just hard code
15:03 - some custom fields i'd rather not do it
15:08 - but because it would just be it would be
15:12 - more work but if i can't get it to work
15:15 - with the with the plugin then i don't
15:18 - really have another option
15:26 - okay all right so I did paste this into
15:36 - Faceman
15:44 - so now I put that link that links in the
15:46 - live chat so if anybody does want to
15:48 - check out that error I really appreciate
15:52 - it if you if you know anything about it
15:54 - but otherwise I'm going to I'm gonna get
16:00 - started so we'll go through
16:07 - let me bring over the my local version
16:12 - and I'll go through just quickly just a
16:16 - very minimal changes from what we had
16:19 - worked on before in the dev site but
16:21 - I'll show you what those are and then
16:22 - we'll get right into we're pretty much
16:25 - done with this page so I think events
16:30 - will probably our next page that we
16:32 - start refactoring and pulling in our
16:34 - data with so I'm going to start my timer
16:37 - and let's go alright so the home page
16:44 - alright as always my dev server needs
16:46 - restarted so obviously I still haven't
16:49 - figured that one out
16:56 - and if you want to check out any of the
16:59 - changes in more depth
17:00 - everything is on github and it is also
17:03 - on the live version of the site the live
17:07 - version of site is actually further
17:08 - ahead right now than the than the dead
17:10 - version then that the IP address for the
17:12 - dead version so the khattak addicts com
17:16 - the production version is where to go to
17:20 - get the latest so anyway all this is
17:21 - still the same the video changed they
17:25 - wanted me to not use a youtube embed
17:26 - because it had the YouTube branding and
17:29 - it was showing ads so that's
17:32 - understandable you don't want ads coming
17:34 - up you know in the middle of your site
17:35 - so I changed to use JW player
17:38 - the only thing about JW player that the
17:41 - only problem I've had and I didn't even
17:42 - notice this until this morning was that
17:45 - if I navigate away from it and go try to
17:50 - go back it doesn't load again so um
17:55 - there's a react plugin for JW player a
18:01 - react component so I'm gonna try to get
18:04 - that to work I just don't have the
18:06 - account information for the account they
18:09 - use JW player with so I'll need to get
18:11 - that to be able to get the plug-in to
18:15 - work so for now it does work on the
18:20 - initial page load and it's fine there's
18:22 - just a different you know different
18:24 - image for the thumbnail that comes up
18:27 - but I think it it's it works and they're
18:31 - happy to people that I'm building this
18:33 - site for happy with it these are all the
18:34 - same everything else the same on this
18:38 - page on the resources page that's
18:42 - probably the the biggest change so I
18:46 - pulled in these used to be on the bottom
18:50 - like below this this section so this now
18:56 - I think this was black the last time we
18:59 - looked at it so I changed it to the red
19:01 - background these are all white now this
19:04 - section is now included in here so it
19:08 - still works
19:10 - the same way it's just the the colors
19:12 - have changed and now it's within this
19:15 - section and then for this I've made two
19:19 - changes one categories only appear here
19:24 - if they actually have resources attached
19:28 - to that category so there were a lot of
19:30 - categories that were put in that had
19:32 - nothing attached to them yet so in the
19:36 - response that we get from the wordpress
19:38 - api it actually lists how many resources
19:43 - are attached to that category so we can
19:46 - just check that and if it's more if it's
19:51 - one or more it shows up here otherwise
19:53 - it doesn't so right now it doesn't seem
19:55 - like there's a lot of categories but
19:58 - there there are and that'll be that's
20:00 - not something that I'm gonna be adding
20:02 - in but hopefully the people in charge of
20:06 - this content will be adding that in also
20:09 - the problem that we had on non Mac
20:13 - browsers I fixed that I just added in a
20:17 - little bit of CSS that made sure that
20:19 - these were always visible so they
20:22 - weren't visible on some in some cases
20:25 - like the the text was the same color as
20:28 - the background just depending on the
20:30 - browser and the operating system the way
20:32 - this displays just it looks different on
20:38 - between I think Firefox definitely I
20:41 - think it what it might have been every
20:43 - browser on Windows for sure looked bad
20:46 - and then Chrome on a boon to so so I'm
20:51 - pretty sure it was nearly every non
20:53 - every browser running on a system that
20:56 - wasn't a Mac was not displaying this
20:58 - correctly you just couldn't see anything
20:59 - so that's fixed now and I think that's
21:04 - it for the the changes so not you know
21:07 - not really a whole lot so now let's move
21:12 - on to the events oh the only other
21:15 - change which is minor I'm not gonna show
21:16 - it is I add in a button actually I did
21:20 - that on the stream on Friday so you
21:21 - already know about that the
21:22 - a change I made to that was I changed
21:24 - the text for the button so they had
21:27 - requested that I changed the text so for
21:33 - this page we just need to we're gonna go
21:36 - in here we're gonna pull in this day
21:38 - that these we may make these their own
21:44 - components so we'll see I'm not sure
21:48 - that that needs to be I did have to edit
21:51 - this a bit as well over the weekend on a
21:54 - small screen these were like huge and
21:59 - took up half so so these headers took up
22:02 - half the screen they're really big and
22:04 - so you could barely see any of this
22:05 - content so I made it just added in some
22:08 - media queries made it smaller maybe so
22:11 - that they would wrap before they weren't
22:12 - wrapping undo another line and then I
22:15 - had to fix the the heights and here to
22:17 - make them line up but I think it looks
22:19 - it's way more readable now than it was
22:26 - all right so let's check out the code
22:30 - for this and I was trying to bring in
22:35 - some data for this state weather
22:38 - displays or not I was going to make this
22:41 - this option to display the content or
22:45 - not I was gonna make that a true or
22:47 - false button within WordPress so that
22:50 - whoever was entering the content could
22:51 - set whether or not the content was
22:53 - displayed by default or whether you had
22:55 - to click to display it and that's when I
22:57 - ran into that error so I'll come back to
23:00 - that hopefully if I can fix that error
23:03 - but for now let's go to or yet courses
23:12 - no events we're gonna do events so let's
23:17 - go to events and it looks like yeah we
23:22 - aren't pulling anything in yet
23:24 - except for those events down the bottom
23:28 - there's nearby events so so we're going
23:32 - to need to pull in that data
23:34 - and let's see we got to decide I've I've
23:42 - pretty much been assured that the only
23:47 - there's always only going to be two
23:49 - things here so the bosko conference
23:52 - which is like the biggest events put on
23:55 - by this this institute and then this
24:00 - speaking the truth and love conference
24:01 - they're always going to be at the top
24:03 - here but I'm not really sure we probably
24:10 - be safe to just make these pages and
24:12 - pull them in and not have to make
24:13 - another custom post type long term I
24:17 - would suspect that maybe they would want
24:20 - to put something else up here and have
24:21 - more than two but since we're running
24:24 - short on time I think I'll just leave it
24:26 - as each one of these is going to be a
24:28 - page so this will end up being event
24:33 - intro event section 1 event section 2
24:35 - and we'll just pull everything in from
24:38 - there it's gonna be we're gonna have to
24:44 - actually I don't know if we can right
24:46 - now because we're gonna need some custom
24:49 - fields to pull in some of these and if
24:53 - our plugins not working we can't pull
24:56 - those in so we can at least pull this
25:00 - and for now and then we're gonna have to
25:01 - hold off on this I may have this may
25:04 - have to wait until after we fix that
25:06 - plug in all right well at least let's
25:11 - pull this in and then that way we'll get
25:13 - some of the some of the code that we
25:16 - need in place that'll make it easier to
25:17 - do this later on so we'll go into
25:22 - where's my WordPress I'm gonna open up
25:26 - WordPress in another another tab since I
25:31 - want to keep that error message up I
25:34 - guess it doesn't matter since I put in
25:37 - pay spin but for now I'll keep that up
25:38 - and let's go in
25:43 - and create these pages oh that's some
25:49 - updates as probably things I am I
25:52 - worried about updating themes we're not
25:54 - really using them anyway so they'll go
26:00 - into pages and make a new page it's
26:05 - gonna be events intro so I think we've
26:11 - been calling them intro and then now
26:12 - let's yeah I'm just gonna copy this and
26:18 - paste it in and that should be yeah
26:28 - that's it that's all we need for this
26:29 - one okay cool so we have our slug events
26:35 - intro and that's what we're gonna want
26:37 - to look for so let's go over to our code
26:43 - and we're just gonna copy some of what
26:46 - we've been doing on our other pages so
26:50 - on the index page let's pull this over
26:55 - here so we can see them both so an index
26:59 - page we can just grab all of this
27:06 - oops I'm already already have that and
27:08 - threw me off because I had to state
27:10 - above it so we don't need to copy that
27:13 - but what we need to do is get
27:24 - okay we are doing some filtering here by
27:28 - date so I think that's okay we can still
27:42 - we can still do that but we need to pull
27:47 - in everything through this multiple post
27:49 - type so let's put that first
28:01 - so we need the multiple post type first
28:03 - and then we need to grab the type
28:12 - let's get rid of this that's what we
28:17 - need nearby event so let's put in our
28:22 - type equals nearby event and then we
28:32 - also need I'm gonna put this at the end
28:37 - just to make it more evident later on
28:41 - that all these filters are really for
28:45 - for this and I do want to see how this
28:48 - how this data gets pulled back so I've
28:50 - had some issues before with using
28:53 - filters when I use this multiple loops
28:57 - this multiple post type end point so I
29:04 - do need type page
29:14 - all right and I think let's just check
29:18 - this out in the browser and see what its
29:21 - gonna look like let's see if it even
29:29 - returns anything okay cool so we are
29:31 - getting a page
29:43 - and
29:48 - okay wow this actually worked a little
29:54 - simple things okay I see so this is this
30:00 - was the problem that I was running into
30:02 - before so when I put any type of filter
30:07 - on that end point it filters everything
30:10 - so right now the pages are being
30:13 - filtered as well as you know all of
30:17 - these which are all the nearby events
30:21 - are I'm sorry not not filtered but in
30:26 - terms of what we get back from WordPress
30:29 - it's filtering out all the things that
30:30 - we don't need so I'm only getting title
30:33 - in advanced custom fields okay so I do
30:36 - need more than that so I'll need the
30:39 - slug and I'll need the content as well
30:43 - so that should be it as long as I get
30:46 - the the slug and the content then that
30:53 - should be fine so let's make sure we add
30:57 - that in
31:11 - okay
31:19 - and I'm not gonna check it again because
31:25 - I'm pretty sure that that will work so
31:28 - now we're getting move this over so
31:33 - don't need anymore so now we should be
31:35 - getting all the data that we need we're
31:37 - still gonna have all the events but in
31:39 - addition we're gonna get all the pages
31:40 - so we can grab the page that we need to
31:45 - fill in this part all right so I will
31:54 - bring this over briefly let's see
32:06 - okay so we're gonna basically do this
32:09 - same thing here so let's just grab this
32:14 - and
32:27 - I'm gonna paste this in now obviously we
32:30 - don't want a blockquote for this section
32:34 - so instead we're gonna do don't want a
32:41 - pee thing no actually I don't I don't
32:43 - even want a paragraph tag in here I want
32:50 - they want to bring in this column
32:58 - and let's pull out all this we don't
33:01 - need this I'm gonna bring in this column
33:10 - hmm
33:11 - I thought I got rid of that I did it's I
33:18 - guess it's just messed up because I
33:22 - don't have a closing div for this so I
33:26 - guess for now I'm just gonna put this in
33:28 - I think it's gonna get taken out though
33:30 - whenever prettier runs whenever we say
33:34 - this it'll probably change that but for
33:37 - now it'll just keep in my mind when I
33:41 - see this it'll be easier to realize
33:43 - where all the dips go we do want to put
33:47 - flow text on here because we want that
33:50 - font size and let's get rid of this we
33:58 - don't need that and those content
34:02 - rendered go study yep that's it that's
34:06 - what we need the only other thing we
34:08 - need to change is this so we're gonna
34:11 - want to get events intro alright and
34:18 - that should give us what we need let's
34:20 - check back here on this page I guess it
34:23 - did not give us who he needed I'm gonna
34:26 - shadow refresh it just in case let me
34:28 - see what's on it so at least these are
34:29 - still showing up and my my dev server
34:34 - needs restarted and as soon as I get
34:41 - this working I'm gonna check the chat
34:42 - again it's been about 20 minutes and so
34:46 - check the chat
34:53 - just a mess something up
35:03 - hmm all right let's see what I messed up
35:05 - here
35:17 - let's go
35:25 - alright let me read this object keys
35:35 - Oh what did I do
35:57 - Oh area that's the problem
36:00 - I had this tag was actually closed and
36:06 - it shouldn't have been closed it should
36:07 - add all this in here now this will work
36:11 - that's why my highlighting was off I
36:13 - thought it was just it wasn't picking up
36:16 - this tag but in fact that I had closed
36:19 - that an opening tag
36:51 - all right okay cool so this is loaded in
36:57 - these are still loading properly awesome
37:05 - now we are gonna need to change a little
37:08 - bit about how we do this now so if you
37:11 - remember I guess a few weeks ago we had
37:14 - put in some things for instance we could
37:18 - move this around and see I should still
37:24 - working let's see maybe maybe we thought
37:28 - ahead about this my fear was that this
37:33 - would filter so these down here would
37:39 - filter through all the the data
37:49 - looks like it might still be I'm just
37:52 - worried that the pages that we're now
37:54 - getting up here will be counted in with
37:59 - the events yeah so we're just getting
38:03 - the data what are we setting - the data
38:06 - the component did now
38:18 - hmm
38:28 - okay so we are getting the data we're
38:32 - filtering it so that any old events
38:35 - aren't displayed but so we may not have
38:42 - to worry about filtering it because it's
38:49 - possible that because the pages don't
38:52 - have the advanced custom field of dates
38:54 - that they're automatically getting
38:56 - filtered out but I don't want to leave
39:00 - it up to that in case that just seems to
39:04 - me like it's not really an explicit
39:06 - filter for those things and I'm a little
39:09 - bit worried about it so let's put in two
39:12 - filters and what I want to filter out is
39:30 - and I'll probably need to get I'll need
39:36 - to bring in type so we will need to get
39:44 - the post type as well so we're pulling
39:47 - them type in now that we're pulling the
39:49 - type in I can access type so I want type
39:52 - and I need it to equal and this is
39:57 - nearby event I think it would just be
40:01 - singular event we'll find out in a
40:04 - second as soon as I save this okay looks
40:11 - good I'm gonna do a refresh just to be
40:12 - sure all right great
40:15 - and to be really really sure we can
40:20 - always inspect and go over to react and
40:23 - we should be able to see our props
40:31 - and let's see so we have our page prop
40:35 - there but then this drops data
40:46 - yeah actually our our props own ups I'm
40:50 - sorry we're not the props are up here
40:53 - and that's fine that this is everything
40:54 - but we want to we want to set our state
40:56 - of data then so the state should be what
41:00 - only has the nearby events so let's see
41:04 - it actually it's not showing me anything
41:07 - about the state which is maybe I'm
41:11 - missing and how do I see the state in
41:14 - the react dev tools I know I've seen it
41:19 - before I'm not sure why it's not showing
41:20 - up now anyway it's it's obviously
41:25 - working because we see this we see this
41:28 - there's no crossover going on so in
41:33 - terms of seeing pages here what we
41:35 - shouldn't alright so that was good
41:39 - timing now it's time to go back to the
41:41 - live chat for at least five minutes
41:44 - we'll see what's going on here all right
41:51 - so I'm gonna go back up here
42:03 - okay hey Sebastian Sebastian said I need
42:06 - to add cursor:pointer to the course
42:11 - title let's see
42:14 - actually I do that I have it on there
42:16 - I'm not working on let me check
42:22 - oops
42:23 - is it courses yeah actually it is
42:29 - working here so I'm not sure is it not
42:33 - working for you if so what what browser
42:36 - and device combination are you using
42:44 - alright hey everyone I see some people
42:46 - saying hi hey
42:55 - I'd have some questions so our play asks
42:58 - did you work with react native I have
43:01 - not worked with it yet I am going to be
43:03 - working with it soon probably by soon I
43:07 - mean sometime within the next few months
43:09 - so I'm taking a react course through
43:13 - Udacity and the last part of the course
43:16 - is deals with react native so hopefully
43:19 - when I do that part of the course I'll
43:22 - share with you how it is and I'm hoping
43:24 - that maybe I can have some sort of
43:26 - project at work that I'll be able to use
43:28 - react native with and then I could
43:30 - stream that so that would be cool maybe
43:36 - maybe I can do some type of video where
43:39 - I go through react native for whatever
43:42 - project that I'm doing for this course
43:44 - I'll have to see I assume it would be
43:48 - okay to stream stuff I'm doing for that
43:50 - course but I mean it's a paid course so
43:52 - I don't know if they want people
43:53 - streaming course material so I might
43:56 - have to double check on that just to
43:58 - make sure it's alright but anyway yeah I
44:00 - haven't worked with it yet but soon
44:03 - soon I will be rollin said just got here
44:07 - what's happening basically we're just
44:12 - going through what we did last week the
44:14 - end of last week just pulling in data
44:16 - from the wordpress api trying to
44:20 - refactor where we can and we had a
44:23 - little bit of an issue or we have an
44:25 - error coming up with one of our
44:26 - WordPress plugins so that's limiting a
44:28 - little bit what we can do but there's
44:30 - still enough to be done that you can
44:33 - definitely fill up the stream with other
44:36 - things
44:44 - okay so Andrew Ritter says sometimes
44:48 - cannot modify header info has to do with
44:50 - white space at the top or bottom of a
44:52 - PHP file okay that's uh that's
44:57 - interesting that's good to know
44:58 - I don't I didn't manually edit a PHP
45:01 - file so but I will check I'll definitely
45:10 - check that out maybe I can manually just
45:13 - look at the files and see if something's
45:15 - going on in there I don't see why I
45:18 - didn't update the advanced custom fields
45:22 - plug-in was not actually updated
45:25 - directly so I don't know that it's that
45:27 - one I did update WordPress so it's
45:31 - possible that something with the newest
45:33 - version of WordPress is interacting with
45:35 - the advanced custom fields plug-in but I
45:37 - don't know I it's I did hold off on
45:39 - updating WordPress for a while an
45:41 - advanced custom fields is a really
45:42 - popular plugin so you would think that
45:44 - any issues would have been sorted out
45:46 - but but anyway it's good to know Andrew
45:49 - thank you
45:50 - hey Zanna how's it going Suzanne has
45:53 - joined us in the live chat says Jessie
45:56 - you never read your Twitter while live
45:58 - have you sent me something on Twitter oh
46:00 - yeah I see it now
46:07 - okay I saw I saw your message so yeah
46:13 - that's true I don't always see what's
46:15 - going on on Twitter on when I'm live so
46:20 - I have my screen my third screen is
46:23 - filled up with the analytics for the
46:26 - chat or for the channel and in the chat
46:29 - window so I don't really have them and
46:33 - my OBS is up there so I don't have much
46:35 - space for for Twitter and actually I
46:37 - usually do see things that are going on
46:39 - on Twitter on my phone but I have the
46:42 - stream in what's Instagram so the
46:51 - Instagram stream is blowing on my phone
46:52 - so I'm not seeing anything which I don't
46:54 - even think anybody is watching me on
46:56 - Instagram so I suppose I could shut it
46:57 - off but hey Jeremy how's it going
47:10 - how Jeremy says always stoked to suggest
47:12 - these vids I'm glad to hear I'm glad you
47:14 - enjoy the videos
47:33 - okay so having some some comments in
47:36 - here about this air I'm gonna bring this
47:37 - air back up in case someone didn't see
47:39 - it from earlier since I'm gonna be
47:40 - referring to it now so I'm having this
47:43 - error or when I try to edit fields in
47:47 - the advanced custom fields plug-in so
47:51 - Sara says the first warning was about
47:55 - for each and its same PHP page so header
48:00 - and for each are the problem Zanna says
48:06 - she's having a piece of cake actually
48:09 - the cake sounds really good right now I
48:11 - had I didn't remember to eat today so I
48:15 - went out and bought sushi for lunch so
48:20 - that was great but it doesn't really
48:21 - satisfy a sweet tooth at all and I tried
48:27 - nicely true I don't normally get like
48:30 - the canned coffee stuff but there is a
48:33 - cold brew canned coffee I don't know
48:36 - about it I'm not sure there's anybody
48:37 - know a good brand of cold brew coffee to
48:41 - buy I like it when I make it myself I
48:44 - haven't really found a store brought
48:46 - brand like a ready-made brand that I
48:49 - like they always have this weird
48:50 - aftertaste
49:01 - okay so John Hanson says html5 video tag
49:04 - with source may be a better choice it's
49:06 - easier to use with JavaScript when you
49:08 - need an alternative to an embedded
49:10 - YouTube video yeah I hadn't thought of
49:12 - that
49:13 - so initially so Friday I think it was
49:18 - Friday afternoon or Friday night when I
49:20 - got the the new embed code saying like
49:24 - hey we don't want YouTube we want we
49:25 - want this so my my first thought was
49:29 - that that I would just download that
49:32 - video and then do an html5 video tag but
49:36 - I thought you know what it's worth a
49:37 - shot just to throw this embed code in
49:39 - and see if it works and I didn't expect
49:40 - expected to work in the same way that
49:43 - the YouTube embed code had worked
49:45 - because it's not even the same you know
49:47 - YouTube is an iframe and this one was
49:49 - actually a script tag so I was really
49:52 - skeptical of it and I'll bring it up
49:55 - here since I'm talking about it so y'all
49:57 - can see what I'm referring to you gotta
50:00 - have it on my index page so this is what
50:07 - what I popped in here in place of the
50:09 - YouTube iframe and it actually worked
50:14 - now unfortunately at the time I did not
50:17 - realize that it didn't work when I was
50:19 - using the client-side routing so I just
50:21 - realized that when I started working
50:24 - today and I was looking up some
50:27 - different ways to to fix that so I may
50:30 - end up going with that since I only have
50:33 - today and tomorrow to work on it if I
50:35 - don't hear back with the account
50:36 - information for JW player then I'm gonna
50:40 - have to go with the html5 thing the only
50:43 - reason I didn't want to do that is
50:44 - because it gives users a few more
50:47 - options when you have like the embedded
50:50 - player so they can pick different
50:52 - qualities of the stream and things like
50:55 - that and if there is any extras like
50:57 - closed captioning then that's available
51:00 - in an embed whereas I don't I have no
51:02 - idea if you if you can do that with
51:04 - html5 I assume there's some way to do it
51:06 - but I don't know how and I don't really
51:08 - have the time to do it so but anyway
51:11 - John that was my first thought as well
51:12 - so thanks for the
51:14 - for the suggestion some of my other
51:17 - sites I have known that route of using
51:20 - the video tag
51:34 - oh okay Sebastian reminded me I'm sorry
51:37 - I I got a lot of good advice from you
51:40 - all last week about how to fix my dev
51:42 - server and then I didn't I did never try
51:45 - it because so last week I had to if you
51:49 - remember I had to leave like immediately
51:51 - after I stopped streaming to go to a
51:54 - meeting with a client so I completely
51:57 - forgot what what you all said when I
52:00 - came in this morning I didn't I hadn't
52:03 - made I didn't even have time to make a
52:04 - note of it anywhere so I'm really sorry
52:07 - I'm over here talking about not being
52:09 - able to fix my dev server when you all
52:10 - already gave me plenty of things to try
52:13 - so I apologize for that I'll try that
52:16 - today I think I'm gonna work late today
52:19 - my wife is gonna have the kids at her
52:21 - parents house so I'm just gonna stay
52:24 - after and work so I'll definitely have
52:25 - time after the stream to work on that it
52:28 - kind of stinks though that I'm finally
52:29 - hopefully gonna fix my dev server and
52:33 - then I'm gonna move on to another
52:35 - project so but I kinda want to fix it
52:38 - now just just to say that I've fixed it
52:43 - and we've got one of my co-workers is
52:46 - joining in on the Instagram live
52:50 - livestream so so that's cool hey Liz
52:58 - how's it going but all right so I see
53:04 - I'm definitely gonna try to no Sebastian
53:06 - gave me some advice I'm pretty sure
53:07 - Patrick that you gave me some advice as
53:09 - well okay Patrick did say I don't need
53:13 - two filters I could just use you know an
53:16 - and one actually I think we had talked
53:20 - about this in an earlier stream and I
53:23 - don't know if you were watching at the
53:25 - time or not Patrick so I had I had
53:27 - proposed you know should I just do an x'
53:30 - or should I do the separate filters and
53:32 - the the consensus was that you don't
53:36 - need to do separate filters but it makes
53:38 - it more readable so that's why I ended
53:41 - up going with separate filters so I'm
53:44 - gonna keep going with that since I've
53:45 - got done
53:46 - throughout the site at this point but it
53:49 - is good to know for everyone if if
53:50 - you're watching if you're you know using
53:52 - filters like this you don't have to do
53:55 - separate filters you can chain together
53:58 - things in your filters this is just more
54:02 - of a style decision
54:18 - okay cool so I am earlier I had
54:22 - mentioned that I wasn't I wasn't seeing
54:25 - the state where's this in Devils so I
54:28 - was just seeing props in that state and
54:30 - several of you in the live chat have
54:33 - told me that because I need to actually
54:35 - click the component that has the state
54:37 - to see the state so that that is my
54:41 - problem and that's why I can't see the
54:42 - state so you see I'm only seeing props
54:46 - here so let me just try it while I have
54:48 - so which component I don't even remember
54:50 - which component I was trying to look at
54:58 - oh here we go okay so if you're using I
55:02 - don't know if this setup here is because
55:06 - of next j/s that it's it's slightly
55:10 - different so this I suppose this could
55:13 - look different in terms of how you're
55:15 - setting up reacting what you're using
55:16 - with it but for me at least the state it
55:20 - seems lives on this under slash class
55:24 - element here so yeah okay this is
55:29 - definitely what we're looking for so
55:30 - right here you can see we only have ten
55:33 - items in our array for data because we
55:35 - filtered everything out whereas we
55:37 - started with 26 items yeah we started
55:41 - with 26 and now we've gotten filtered
55:44 - down to 10 so that's filtering out
55:48 - anything that's not a nearby event in
55:51 - terms of type and also filtering out
55:55 - anything that an event that has already
55:57 - happened so it has a date that's in the
56:00 - past okay awesome thanks for letting me
56:05 - know because I I always that bothered me
56:07 - that a cait sometimes I could see the
56:09 - state and sometimes I couldn't and I
56:11 - could only see props and that's why so
56:15 - that's definitely gonna help me out now
56:32 - okay so Ennis has said something in
56:35 - another language so I'm not sure what
56:38 - that is but thanks for for joining the
56:40 - chat and let's see
56:58 - okay so Sarah says Fred Meijer has good
57:03 - cold brew so yeah I don't know I don't
57:06 - think they have Fred Meijer around here
57:08 - so I'm in Ohio so let's not all have to
57:12 - keep a lookout for it but I'm pretty
57:14 - sure that's not an option around here
57:19 - but I appreciate the suggestion
57:24 - okay so John says there is a way to
57:27 - build my own html5 player with all the
57:30 - stuff that I mentioned before like
57:32 - closed captioning and things and being
57:34 - able to pick the different options for
57:39 - video quality but it does take a lot of
57:41 - times yeah that would be really cool to
57:44 - do I would enjoy doing that at some
57:46 - point because I do everybody loves it
57:49 - when I put like the fullscreen
57:51 - background videos on sites around here I
57:53 - don't know what it is but if I want to
57:56 - impress somebody with a site all I have
57:57 - to do is put a background video in and
57:59 - and it's like they love it so that will
58:04 - probably be a good thing to learn how to
58:05 - do at some point
58:16 - okay I'm getting towards the the end of
58:21 - the live chat looks like there's some
58:22 - discussion about live reloading and hot
58:25 - reloading and webpack and different
58:27 - things which I'm going to skip over for
58:29 - now because it seems like there's a lot
58:31 - of good information being being spread
58:34 - in the live chat so I don't I don't
58:35 - think my contribution to that discussion
58:40 - will really be worth anything
58:48 - wait so alright Jeremy says Fred Meyers
58:51 - is owned by Kroger's really I did not
58:57 - know that gets nothing
59:11 - okay cool Rowland says Google has an
59:14 - open source project that covers front
59:16 - and back-end for video players that's
59:18 - really cool and that's kind of
59:20 - surprising because you think Google
59:21 - would just say like go with go with the
59:24 - YouTube embed but that's that's cool
59:27 - that they have that and rhoann does say
59:33 - by the way Safari and probably Firefox
59:35 - will start to block a lot of place yeah
59:37 - I do I know Safari will block autoplay
59:39 - so I actually kind of just did a little
59:42 - workaround for that but yeah I kind of I
59:48 - don't like doing auto plays anymore I
59:50 - have done them in the past but I've kind
59:52 - of changed my mind on auto place and
59:54 - decided that I think auto plays are
59:57 - somewhat annoying so I right now like
60:05 - I've gone more like what I've done with
60:07 - this site in putting just a button to
60:11 - play I still think there is a place for
60:14 - auto plays to be used like I'm not
60:16 - entirely against them but it can just be
60:21 - annoying like I know for me sometimes
60:25 - the videos just autoplay depending on
60:27 - what the video is I can get motion sick
60:29 - from the videos not not really I'm not
60:35 - really into it I actually got sick I was
60:39 - developing a site before where I had
60:41 - full screen background video that would
60:43 - kept audio autoplay and I kept getting
60:48 - sick and getting headaches like at every
60:51 - single day and I couldn't figure it out
60:53 - and then finally I realized that the
60:56 - reason that I was getting sick was
60:59 - because of all this autoplay video
61:02 - because I had to sign up on multiple
61:04 - screens and I had it on a on a mobile
61:07 - device as well so even in my peripheral
61:10 - vision I was getting all of this
61:12 - autoplay video going and it was just so
61:16 - once I stopped doing that then I didn't
61:18 - get headaches anymore and I didn't feel
61:19 - sick anymore
61:25 - all right so I my stream on Instagram
61:34 - ended so if you wanted to see my face
61:37 - too late not that not like anybody did
61:39 - but I just wanted to tell you all that
61:43 - in case somebody who was joining in and
61:46 - and saw the link and wanted to watch
61:51 - alright so let's go back to this so
61:53 - basically at this point this is all
61:56 - we're gonna do for this page or I'm
61:59 - sorry we weren't on this page we're on
62:00 - the events page this is all we're gonna
62:02 - do for the events page this is the live
62:05 - site where am I so definitely want to
62:08 - pull this stuff in but need to fix that
62:10 - plug-in first and I'm just so hesitant
62:13 - to work on the plug-in because if it if
62:16 - it deletes this the fields for the other
62:19 - stuff then that's that's gonna be a
62:21 - really big deal when it's gonna mess up
62:22 - the live version of the site so I want
62:24 - to be really really careful about how I
62:27 - do that okay so the resources page is
62:30 - going to be pretty easy we just need to
62:31 - pull this in which is going to be
62:36 - basically the same thing that we just
62:38 - did with the events page we're gonna do
62:40 - here so we'll go ahead and do it it may
62:43 - be a bit boring let me start my timer
62:47 - may be a little bit boring since we just
62:50 - done it but especially for anybody who
62:53 - might be new then repetition is always a
62:55 - good thing to try to figure out how it's
62:58 - done
63:04 - all right so let's bring let's good idea
63:09 - we don't need this I'm gonna get rid of
63:11 - a lot of this stuff because don't say I
63:16 - don't think I have anything important
63:17 - there I have a lot of untitled pages so
63:21 - I that has nothing in it all right I
63:27 - don't need this anymore what is this I
63:33 - don't need this anymore and I need that
63:44 - okay this was from one of the earlier
63:46 - live chats I think this is something I
63:48 - brought over I don't need that okay
63:50 - awesome so now I'll actually be able to
63:52 - see what's going on up here and we'll
63:56 - move the events page over so we can just
63:59 - copy it over the code that we just used
64:02 - here and resources okay so and our
64:12 - resources and our initial API call we
64:18 - need to just do the same thing that we
64:20 - had done to the other one who want to
64:24 - grab
64:30 - this novel passe
64:41 - we're going to say and type
64:49 - equals resources the Titleist
65:00 - I'm sorry I think it I think it's
65:02 - singular as a resource how did we do it
65:04 - over here yeah and then where else we're
65:13 - gonna make sure that we get type and we
65:18 - need title we're also going to need
65:23 - content and we're gonna need slug okay
65:29 - and then finally we need another type
65:37 - equal page okay let me double check yep
65:44 - page alright so we have that and then
65:48 - now we're gonna set the state and for
65:55 - this data when we set the state we
65:57 - actually we want this table stated we
66:00 - want to filter this and we're gonna do
66:07 - the same thing we did before we're gonna
66:08 - filter out those type loose
66:19 - we have filter out those pages because
66:21 - we just want the resources in here now
66:24 - in the intro section that's here we can
66:34 - copy and paste and this will be yeah we
66:38 - can pretty much copy and paste this with
66:39 - very minimal editing and since we have
66:48 - the column already in there post that
66:54 - and then all we have to do is say make
66:57 - this the resource resources intro now I
67:02 - don't really have that yet so it's not
67:03 - gonna do anything so we need to go back
67:05 - in WordPress and make a page a new page
67:17 - the resources intro and ascitic
67:22 - shouldn't have saved it first but i can
67:26 - just grab it here and paste it in there
67:32 - let's publish it and now let's try again
68:10 - all right so that worked great and it
68:15 - looks like everything's still working
68:16 - down here
68:20 - awesome okay so that page is done and
68:27 - with the exception of that a little bit
68:33 - on the events page and then those cards
68:36 - on the home page that's everything that
68:39 - we needed to pull in in terms of you
68:43 - know data from the wordpress api that
68:46 - needs to be editable so we still can't
68:51 - make that live yet until I figure out
68:53 - what's going on with this plug-in let me
68:57 - see what else we could do let's check I
69:02 - want to check this and catch us up a bit
69:05 - I definitely spent another definitely
69:11 - another Pomodoro session it was more
69:14 - than one according to the timer but I I
69:17 - don't want to I don't exactly want to
69:19 - count them as equal and when I'm doing
69:21 - the stream since I stopped you know
69:23 - occasionally and answer questions so
69:29 - what we need to do
69:42 - Oh actually I know what I wanted to do
69:46 - something earlier and I had completely
69:48 - forgotten so now it's a great time to
69:51 - show you so I had on fright I think it
69:58 - was either Friday or maybe Saturday
70:00 - morning I can't remember for sure
70:05 - Patrick had submitted a pull request to
70:17 - refactor the expanding section component
70:22 - so the I think it was the last thing we
70:25 - were doing on Friday was refactoring the
70:29 - component are attempting to refactor
70:32 - that and I didn't get it you know
70:36 - finished completely so Patrick went in
70:41 - and let's see of course you all can see
70:46 - this you know for your cell phone on
70:47 - github it's definitely available but I
70:49 - just wanted to give give credit where
70:52 - it's due here so you can see like how
70:55 - much nicer this looks and you can see
71:03 - this is just definitely like a much much
71:08 - more lean component here way easier to
71:13 - read so anyway so thanks Patrick I am I
71:16 - merged that in over the weekend when I
71:19 - was working on that and I really
71:21 - appreciate appreciate that so and as you
71:25 - can see it's being used right now on dev
71:27 - the only reason that it's not on the
71:30 - master branch yet is because I was I'm
71:38 - just having issues with that with that
71:41 - plugin as soon as I get those sorted out
71:43 - then everything is going to be used in
71:46 - the master branch on the production
71:48 - servers
71:50 - okay well I wasn't planning on doing any
71:57 - PHP stuff but at this point I kind of
72:01 - think I should I mean that's logically
72:05 - just the next thing that is blocking me
72:07 - from getting done what needs to be done
72:10 - so if there are no vociferous objections
72:14 - to me doing some PHP I'm going to so I
72:18 - didn't I didn't plan on it but let's
72:24 - just take a look at at what's going on
72:26 - here so I'm gonna move this to my other
72:29 - screen and I'm gonna bring up WordPress
72:35 - I'm just going to go through for now at
72:38 - least I'm gonna see if I can get to that
72:45 - first file right from this admin panel
73:01 - let me make this bigger all right so
73:06 - what we're looking for is controllers
73:11 - core controllers field group
73:27 - looks like not seeing all right not
73:36 - seeing yeah so I can't you can't always
73:37 - see all the all the fields are all the
73:41 - files that you need from here so it
73:43 - doesn't look like I'm gonna be see gonna
73:45 - be able to see it so this might be a
73:53 - problem because I don't think I have
73:54 - access to the files on this server
73:58 - directly
74:08 - but let's look up see if anything is on
74:20 - here there we go there's something in
74:23 - support it's a couple of things
74:36 - as ODS because I wasn't attempting to
74:38 - use the repeater field
74:54 - that one wasn't helpful
75:04 - yeah so this these are all talking about
75:07 - the repeater field which I'm not even
75:08 - using I don't think I can use the
75:11 - repeater field unless I get the paid
75:15 - version yep yeah not it all right I'm
75:22 - gonna check let me check the live chat
75:25 - quickly
75:42 - no evil s what is that Bell so this was
75:46 - right around 3:00 3:00 p.m. there's the
75:49 - Bell so so as you all know I work at a
75:53 - Catholic University so around 3:00 p.m.
75:56 - and my building a lot of people from the
76:00 - building get together and they pray
76:02 - together for like 10 15 minutes at 3
76:05 - o'clock so somebody rings a bell to do
76:07 - the reminder for 3 so I obviously
76:09 - haven't been able to do it in in that
76:11 - because I do my live chats at 2:00 so
76:17 - but they usually do they do a prayer
76:21 - called a Divine Mercy chaplet 3 3 is
76:23 - like 3 PM's the traditional time to do
76:26 - that that prayer so that's what the Bell
76:29 - is for so that's why you always hear
76:31 - about at 3:00 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time
76:39 - all right so I'm just going up quickly
76:42 - just to see if I've missed anyone's
76:43 - questions Patrick says autoplays evil
76:48 - yeah
77:04 - Joseph says hi I'm jr. frontend I don't
77:09 - really understand what you're explaining
77:10 - but I just keep listening to you because
77:13 - your videos giving me more motivation
77:14 - awesome well I'm glad that it's it's
77:17 - helping you out in some way so yeah I'll
77:20 - probably towards the end of the project
77:23 - is probably more difficult to understand
77:26 - what's going on but when I start up a
77:29 - new project and it'll probably be way
77:31 - easier for you to follow along and then
77:35 - you know if you can if you can join in
77:37 - on on you know most of the streams then
77:39 - you'll be able to kind of work through
77:40 - it all and understand everything
78:01 - Sode says by the way which project are
78:04 - you working in sir
78:05 - I guess I'm assuming that that was of
78:10 - trying to see if you were he was having
78:12 - a conversation with somebody else said I
78:13 - this is the same project that we've been
78:20 - working in the katha catechol institute
78:23 - react website so in particular though
78:26 - right now we were trying to figure out
78:28 - an error that we're getting with a
78:30 - wordpress plugin and I was just taking a
78:33 - little break to check catch up on the
78:34 - live chat here since I wasn't really
78:37 - finding much that was useful I guess I
78:42 - should let's just pop in this and see if
78:50 - something comes up your PHP no it's it's
78:57 - still saying repeater PHP and and these
79:01 - alright let me finish with what I was
79:03 - going to do in the in the live chat here
79:17 - Joseph says I wonder if it's possible to
79:20 - see your previous livestream and and
79:23 - Zanna answered so Thank You Zanna and
79:26 - for anybody that can't see the live chat
79:29 - yeah you can watch all the previous
79:30 - streams on free code camps channel if
79:34 - you want to go really far back to like
79:36 - the first day I started working on this
79:38 - site the first few videos are on my
79:40 - channel which is linked in the
79:42 - description if you wanted to start from
79:43 - the beginning okay it looks like there's
79:52 - there is a decent amount of discussion
79:54 - about best practices in regard to
79:56 - streaming videos and like because we're
80:00 - talking about auto-playing videos and
80:01 - things so it looks like there's Google
80:06 - on Google Chrome's github there's a repo
80:09 - called sample media PWA
80:12 - and Rowin says that has a lot of good
80:16 - streaming video best practices so so
80:21 - check that out
80:34 - I just saw I had asked if there was any
80:37 - objections to doing trying to figure out
80:40 - the error in WordPress and I just saw
80:43 - Janet said I object but she was kidding
80:50 - those surfers Patrick cave the
80:54 - definition of vociferous yeah is that
80:57 - was it that's a decent word right
80:58 - vociferous not don't really use it too
81:01 - often but it fit Patrick says he is a
81:07 - vociferous opponent of PHP in general
81:09 - but not in this case so all right good
81:12 - all right Sarah saying three from bottom
81:17 - looks like it might be helpful and I
81:21 - probably changed the page before I saw
81:23 - that so let's see once
81:31 - I might have to hit back
81:40 - so let me go I'm just gonna open up a
81:43 - few more of these and see if any of them
81:55 - work
82:00 - oh this is do you see this this is
82:04 - ridiculous
82:05 - so warning you know the title of this
82:09 - thing just has it there's no explanation
82:12 - and just problem solved that's so
82:15 - helpful and being really sarcastic
82:27 - sorry I didn't upgrade so that's not
82:29 - really
82:38 - mm-hmm I don't think that even has
82:41 - anything to do with it
82:57 - no I don't think that's not the same
82:59 - issue
83:07 - all right let's I want to try want to
83:16 - try something
83:32 - okay
83:36 - all right so it doesn't matter what I do
83:39 - or what let me change the field type I
83:43 - was trying to get an idea for like what
84:04 - this
84:15 - hmm yeah it doesn't matter field group
84:18 - PHP
84:32 - yeah so I can't add anything now I
84:35 - really this had to have had something to
84:38 - do with updating
84:50 - let me figure I need to I really want I
84:52 - want to look up which version of
84:55 - WordPress I'm using right now you see if
85:00 - there's some type of issue
85:12 - before point eight
85:50 - okay
86:21 - let me I'm gonna pull in some in this
86:23 - area no arguments
86:34 - who won't see it as the repeater field
86:37 - this is always what happens
86:57 - see
87:02 - I wonder
87:07 - well at least I'll be able to see what
87:10 - what's in this part of the file was on
87:13 - that line
87:56 - all right so this is the line is
87:58 - throwing the air
88:30 - and Nan says it's one o'clock in the
88:32 - morning here in India and I'm staying
88:33 - awake to see this livestream you're a
88:35 - great inspiration thanks for this man I
88:37 - really appreciate that
88:39 - I think it's amazing that you're staying

88:53 - inspiration to you and yeah that makes
88:59 - me anyway I when I hear stuff like that
89:03 - I do really appreciate it makes me want
89:04 - to keep streaming yeah someone had said
89:09 - earlier lefty said earlier there's
89:15 - always time to pray so yeah that is
89:18 - definitely true yeah so I do miss the
89:22 - prayer at 3 o'clock which a chemist
89:25 - thing I I did kind of like you know
89:28 - getting together with everybody and
89:30 - praying it's kind of nice because
89:31 - sometimes you know you don't always get
89:33 - along with all your co-workers but it's
89:35 - cool to come together you know and pray
89:37 - for each other so kind of helps helps
89:41 - get through all the the tension of
89:44 - normal workdays but but there's
89:51 - definitely other times throughout the
89:53 - day for prayer
90:00 - car I'm sorry I don't
90:02 - Musharaf pronounces cart car needs cook
90:05 - says hello is there a series where you
90:09 - start to hook up your project to
90:10 - WordPress yes so I don't know about a
90:14 - series but there's definitely a video
90:16 - where I hook things up to WordPress and
90:18 - I don't remember offhand what the title
90:21 - of that video would be but I'm pretty
90:23 - sure if you check out this plet the live
90:25 - coding with Jesse clay list on free code
90:27 - camp and just look for the titles that
90:31 - say WordPress then it'll be one of those
90:35 - and I'll show a show a little bit about
90:39 - how I set up WordPress about how I pull
90:41 - in data and things like that I'll
90:45 - probably end up doing some sort of
90:46 - tutorial video on my own channel about
90:48 - that because that would be I want to
90:53 - like do tutorial videos to show how all
90:56 - the sites that I make for for this
90:58 - university work and then that way if
91:01 - someone else if something happens to me
91:03 - and someone else needs to work on the
91:06 - sites then they'll be able to see what's
91:08 - going on from the videos and hopefully
91:11 - it can also help other people who are
91:13 - doing similar projects elsewhere to kind
91:16 - of just see how I did things okay so I
91:23 - think
91:36 - my here it is all right so let me see
91:48 - it was talking about the the post ID
92:02 - this was wait I mean this looks why
92:07 - would the post IDs be be the problem
92:23 - the thing is - I think this file itself
92:26 - has not undergone any changes for like
92:29 - two years I think I think that's what it
92:32 - said
92:45 - I really hate to restore the backup
92:48 - because I I did add things and let me
92:54 - see what where that when the last backup
92:56 - is because I added a lot of data in and
92:58 - I think it was all done after I backed
93:01 - it up
93:21 - I hate to have to add that in add it
93:24 - back in again but I'm not sure you know
93:28 - what I don't really think that I have
93:31 - the access that I need to try to fix
93:34 - this because really what I really want
93:39 - to be able to do is check out I mean I
93:43 - could see this with this file supposed
93:45 - to be doing but I want to be able to see
93:46 - this file and right now I don't have
93:48 - access to that file so I need to I need
93:54 - to talk to the guy that setup the server
93:57 - and that's one of my co-workers set it
94:01 - up I need to talk to him and get access
94:03 - to this and see what's going on
94:21 - all right so
94:26 - yeah for uh probably for this dream I
94:34 - think now I'm just I'm gonna go to the
94:36 - live chat I'm gonna take some questions
94:37 - and then I'll probably wrap this dream
94:39 - up because I want to be able to talk to
94:41 - my my colleague about this this plugin
94:45 - error before he leaves I don't want to
94:49 - make him stay late trying to figure this
94:51 - out so I left the end I know I kind of
94:55 - plan on doing this dream until 4:00 it's
94:57 - 3:30 so it'll probably end around there
95:00 - depending on how many questions I get
95:01 - anyway so I guess it'll be about the
95:03 - same length as normal so I feel this
95:06 - just feels like a weird stream it's been
95:08 - a bit frustrating I guess I it's a
95:11 - little bit different I tried to do some
95:12 - different stuff at the beginning and
95:14 - then ended up ended up with this getting
95:17 - an error two minutes before the stream
95:18 - started so a little bit of a weird
95:21 - stream hopefully somebody got something
95:23 - helpful out of the stream which seemed
95:25 - like a few people said at the very least
95:26 - they got inspiration out of it so I
95:29 - guess that's just how it goes
95:30 - some days you just you just have
95:33 - problems so that we could get some
95:37 - things accomplished and so if anyone has
95:42 - any questions now would be the time to
95:44 - put them in the live chat or you can
95:47 - direct message me on Twitter you can put
95:49 - it in the comments for this video and
95:50 - I'll get to them as soon as I can
95:52 - right now I'm gonna scroll up a bit in
95:54 - the chat i'ma go through and see if I
95:56 - missed anyone's question and don't worry
96:01 - if you're new like don't worry about
96:04 - asking questions that you think might
96:06 - not be a good question or it might be
96:08 - kind of like a noob question to ask
96:10 - don't I it does not bother me you can
96:15 - ask me ask me whatever you want even if
96:19 - you think it's a silly question
96:24 - I'm definitely beginner-friendly in
96:29 - terms of the questions here nobody is
96:31 - going to nobody will ridicule you if you
96:35 - ask a beginner question
96:57 - oh yeah I just went up up to the top of
97:01 - the stream and I saw so Jeremy was in
97:02 - the stream Jeremy I don't know if you're
97:04 - still there but yeah you you just got a
97:06 - new job
97:08 - how is it going did you start yet I
97:11 - can't remember if you started a job yet
97:13 - if so and you're still watching let me
97:15 - know how it goes otherwise maybe I'll
97:16 - catch you tomorrow or sometime later
97:19 - this week in the stream and we can get
97:22 - an update on the new job
97:31 - oh yeah I forget to tell you all so last
97:34 - week on Friday I ended the stream was
97:38 - gonna go right to a meeting with a
97:39 - client so the client never showed up
97:41 - turns out that she had emailed me while
97:46 - I was streaming and I didn't see the
97:48 - email so I had gotten so many emails
97:51 - during the stream they got pushed down
97:52 - in my inboxes normally I'll check at
97:55 - least I'll see him come up on my phone
97:57 - as I'm streaming and I can see if
97:59 - there's something important well I just
98:01 - got too many emails right around the
98:02 - same time and it didn't even show up in
98:05 - my notifications that had already been
98:06 - pushed down so anyway so I had rushed to
98:10 - the place where I was supposed to meet
98:12 - and she didn't come luckily that place
98:15 - had good Wi-Fi
98:17 - well I wouldn't I don't know if it was
98:19 - good Wi-Fi but it was good enough Wi-Fi
98:21 - for me to get a do a little bit so I was
98:23 - able to to at least get a few things
98:26 - done while I was waiting before I saw
98:29 - the email that she wasn't gonna be there
98:31 - so I had a little bit of coffee and did
98:34 - a little work so it wasn't wasn't a
98:41 - complete waste inside wasted time to go
98:43 - but now I still have no idea what's
98:45 - gonna happen with this potential client
98:48 - in this project so I'll keep you all in
98:52 - front informed we might meet this Friday
98:55 - so we'll see we'll see how it goes but
98:58 - it's not really a good sign for a client
99:00 - if they if they bail on the first
99:02 - meetings it's not not really sure that
99:08 - this is a Frederick that I want to work
99:10 - on
99:41 - okay I'm scrolling down I'm getting down
99:44 - towards the bottom of the live chat so
99:46 - it looks like I had kept up pretty well
99:48 - with with the questions and you all do a
99:58 - great job on the live chat of answering
99:59 - everyone's questions - most of the time
100:02 - you answer the question is better than I
100:05 - could before I even see them
100:14 - okay Patrick I just saw your comment
100:17 - when I was I pointed out you know that
100:19 - Patrick kid had done the pool request
100:22 - refactoring that big component so and
100:25 - Patrick says happy to do it it was a fun
100:27 - exercise and refactoring so well I'm
100:29 - glad you had fun doing and I do I very
100:32 - much appreciate the help that was those
100:35 - really awesome and when you all send
100:38 - that pool requests like I always learned
100:40 - so much from them so I always look I go
100:43 - line by line I check out what you which
100:46 - you've done and not that I don't trust
100:48 - you it's more for me because I learned
100:51 - so much just seeing how you do things as
100:56 - opposed to what what I had done and just
100:59 - learning a lot by how you improved it
101:01 - I'm I'm amazed at how much more I
101:03 - learned from looking at your pool
101:06 - requests then I I've learned from just
101:09 - looking at code or you know it's it's
101:11 - it's just a different thing when you see
101:13 - somebody else's take on your code trying
101:17 - to solve the same problem that you had
101:19 - and just making it doing in a better way
101:23 - just it's really really helpful just way
101:27 - more helpful and in educational than I
101:30 - ever thought it would be
101:47 - ooh Tom asks is there any SAS tutorial
101:50 - video from free code can't I don't I
101:57 - don't know offhand I haven't done a
101:59 - video so I know for sure that I haven't
102:01 - done a SAS tutorial video for free code
102:05 - camp I think I have used tonight you
102:11 - says I think I use some sass and some of
102:14 - my earlier videos but it certainly
102:15 - wasn't a tutorial it was just me using
102:17 - it so I don't know I'm sorry I can't
102:23 - I don't remember offhand if there is any
102:25 - videos on free code camp but free the
102:27 - free code camp YouTube channel has a lot
102:29 - of videos so there's certainly playlists
102:32 - that I have not checked out so there may
102:35 - be something in there but I just I don't
102:37 - know so if anybody else has ever seen
102:40 - anything on free code camps channel
102:42 - about sass please let us know in the in
102:48 - the live chat or in the comments of this
102:50 - video or again I know I have seen other
102:54 - tutorial videos for sass elsewhere so
102:58 - there are definitely some good ones
103:00 - which I'm like who uses
103:08 - I can't remember what I've seen really
103:10 - good ones but when you're talking about
103:13 - SATs I assume you mean like the scss
103:16 - version of SAS and not like the original
103:20 - success that is just all like
103:24 - indentation if you want to know about
103:26 - the original SAS that is different it
103:32 - let's say more different from CSS then s
103:37 - CSS so I confused myself with all this
103:42 - then travis has a guy named Travis does
103:49 - a youtube show called dev tips and I
103:52 - know he's done videos on that but he
103:54 - does use kind of like the the older
103:56 - version of sass which doesn't have any
103:59 - like punctuation everything's done with
104:02 - indentation so may not be what you want
104:05 - because I don't think very many people
104:06 - use use that format that much at least I
104:13 - don't see it very often I I have used it
104:15 - for a project the only thing I don't
104:16 - like about it is it's not you can't just
104:19 - copy and paste in regular CSS from
104:22 - somewhere and have it work with s CSS
104:26 - you can and that's that's kind of a big
104:29 - deal especially if you're using a
104:31 - framework for a project because off
104:33 - frequently you know you need to just
104:36 - copy in pieces of stuff so anyway sorry
104:41 - I can't remember any other videos other
104:44 - than that
104:50 - okay Patrick also mentioned def chip dev
104:54 - tips channel okay Patrick prefers the
104:58 - SAS format versus s CSS yeah honestly I
105:06 - wish I wish that you could that there
105:09 - was some way to copy in regular CSS into
105:13 - SAS and then I probably would still use
105:17 - the just the like regular SAS format
105:20 - instead of s CSS because it's so fast to
105:23 - type which is the indentation I really
105:26 - really like that it'd be cool if maybe
105:29 - you there was just some type of tag like
105:32 - and if you put something inside that tag
105:35 - then it could be regular CSS and it
105:38 - would work you know to break the flow of
105:40 - the normal thing I don't know if that
105:42 - would be possible to put in or something
105:43 - but that would be that would be cool
105:47 - that would make it ideal for me and I
105:49 - would I would still use it I think
105:52 - Rohan says he prefers s CSS over SAS but
105:59 - probably is because the muscle memory is
106:01 - trained trained for semicolons yeah
106:04 - that's true Rowan says I thought s CSS
106:12 - and SAS are developed in parallel yeah
106:14 - I'm not really sure that might be read I
106:15 - always just assumed that SAS was the
106:18 - older of the two but I might be mistaken
106:20 - now what I think about I'm not really
106:22 - sure where I learned that from it was
106:25 - probably just an assumption on my part
106:29 - Jay asks hey Jessie which do you prefer
106:32 - react or angular and why so I do prefer
106:36 - react but I will say I don't think I am
106:40 - experienced enough with angular to have
106:42 - a very good opinion about it so I think
106:45 - they're both really good for what they
106:47 - do
106:49 - for me I've had an easier time learning
106:52 - react I tried to learn angular a few
106:56 - years ago probably more than a few at
106:58 - this point maybe
107:00 - like three or four years ago and I
107:03 - didn't have it wasn't that easy for me
107:05 - to learn and I wasn't able to really
107:08 - make anything great with it so but I
107:12 - my experience with JavaScript in general
107:15 - was like really minimal at that point I
107:17 - wasn't that good with it so that
107:18 - probably is why I didn't have a very
107:21 - easy time with it but I think react is I
107:29 - like react because it seems pretty easy
107:32 - to to pick up on you don't need to learn
107:35 - a lot of extra stuff it seems like most
107:38 - of it I know there is some this huge
107:39 - debate on Twitter recently about saying
107:42 - that things are just JavaScript and I
107:47 - don't want to get into that whole debate
107:49 - but like saying that react is a lot of
107:52 - just JavaScript is a lot of it is like
107:55 - normal JavaScript syntax you don't need
107:58 - to learn all this extra stuff when I
108:01 - don't know what angular is like now but
108:05 - angular felt it felt like there was a
108:08 - lot more like the templating syntax that
108:12 - was specific to angular that I needed to
108:14 - learn but like in react JSX works just
108:19 - like normal HTML the tags are all really
108:21 - the same and in terms of like when I
108:25 - want to do more templating stuff like I
108:27 - use template literals which are a part
108:29 - of JavaScript so it seems like when I'm
108:33 - developing with react I use more of
108:36 - things that are already built into
108:38 - JavaScript to get things done when I was
108:41 - working with angular I always had to
108:44 - look up the angular way to do things
108:47 - like even things like iterating over
108:50 - elements or something like that
108:52 - there was like an NG - something that
108:56 - did everything so I liked the fact that
108:59 - react with react I'm not just learning
109:02 - the react way to do things but I'm
109:04 - learning JavaScript ways to do things so
109:07 - that I could use with other projects
109:09 - that I'm not using react on so I kind of
109:12 - like that
109:14 - I like the fact that react works like
109:17 - react can be rendered to other things so
109:20 - you know you can use react native to
109:22 - build mobile apps you can go desktop
109:24 - apps you can even do VR stuff so that's
109:28 - kind of cool I really like all of that
109:32 - so anyway but as I said I don't I
109:36 - haven't used any of the newer versions
109:37 - of angular so I don't think it's really
109:39 - a fair comparison on my part between the
109:42 - two because I don't have any knowledge
109:45 - at all of any of the newer stuff but
109:49 - anyway I hope that answers your question
109:51 - and I know I've talked about this before
109:54 - previously but it looks like Karl asked
110:00 - a similar question hey Jesse after
110:02 - learning Jay s do you recommend react or
110:05 - angular so the similar question not
110:08 - exactly the same the first one was what
110:12 - do I prefer the second one is what do I
110:14 - recommend so yeah and you asked it like
110:17 - in terms of after learning Jaso after
110:19 - learning JavaScript do you prefer react
110:22 - or angular I I actually don't think you
110:25 - need to wait until after you learn
110:27 - JavaScript maybe it seems like that's
110:30 - implied in the question at least implied
110:33 - that you're saying you you're gonna
110:35 - learn jobs here first and then go to a
110:37 - framework I don't think you need to and
110:41 - here's the here's how I feel about
110:43 - learning JavaScript in everything like
110:45 - if you're trying to work and make money
110:47 - like if you need to pay the bills if you
110:49 - have to support your family or something
110:50 - like that like we can't talk about the
110:53 - idea if we want to talk about the ideal
110:55 - situation of what should you learn when
110:57 - and in what order like we can talk about
110:59 - that all day if we want to but there
111:01 - aren't very many people that are in that
111:03 - ideal situation where they get to spend
111:05 - all their time learning and don't have
111:06 - to worry about actually like fulfilling
111:08 - requirements from clients and things
111:10 - like that so my advice would be learn
111:15 - what you have to learn to pay the bills
111:18 - you know and to to make your clients
111:21 - happy
111:23 - and don't worry about saying I want to
111:25 - learn all of JavaScript first I'm not
111:28 - saying that's what you mean by that
111:29 - question but just in general I would say
111:33 - to anybody starting out don't worry so
111:35 - much about saying the guy you know I got
111:37 - to learn vanilla JavaScript I don't want
111:38 - to mix with anything that'll come if you
111:43 - want to pick up right off the bat egg do
111:45 - some basic JavaScript enough so that you
111:47 - can start to understand react and I
111:49 - would recommend react and for reasons
111:52 - mentioned above like I've just had a
111:54 - much easier time doing it and you do
111:57 - learn a lot more in my opinion you learn
111:59 - a lot more of regular JavaScript stuff
112:02 - when you're doing things with react and
112:04 - you have less of you know really and
112:08 - react in terms of react only stuff it's
112:12 - really like the component lifecycle
112:15 - functions and things that's the only
112:17 - like react only way of doing things that
112:20 - I've seen so anyway I would recommend
112:25 - going to react and I would say like
112:27 - don't as soon as you can start to
112:29 - understand react and build things with
112:31 - it then go for it
112:32 - you'll pick up a lot of the JavaScript
112:34 - like for me I picked up so much
112:38 - JavaScript like I had never used filter
112:41 - or map before I used react I had built a
112:45 - ton of stuff I have I've built websites
112:47 - using javascript for years before I ever
112:50 - used react and I never use filter or map
112:54 - so those are like things that I use
112:58 - constantly now that I did not use before
113:03 - I mean that's just one example but my
113:07 - javascript skills have increased while
113:10 - I'm learning react so if I would have
113:12 - waited and said I'm gonna learn all this
113:14 - stuff it probably would have taken me a
113:16 - long time and now at this point I'm
113:18 - getting better with JavaScript but I
113:20 - also now know how to use react so I
113:23 - don't think they have to be separate I
113:25 - think you can you can move into it at
113:28 - the same time and I think just in
113:30 - general you shouldn't worry so much like
113:32 - about the order of learning things like
113:34 - unless you're in the unique situate
113:36 - of saying I don't have to worry about
113:39 - making money I have all the time in the
113:40 - world I can try to do this the perfect
113:43 - way
113:43 - well then maybe maybe you do want to go
113:45 - in order of mastering plain vanilla
113:50 - JavaScript first but I don't I don't
113:53 - really know that there's much merit in
113:55 - that I think that you're fine to just go
114:00 - right into a framework and then and I
114:03 - would recommend react in in that case
114:13 - okay Patrick asks also in in regard to
114:19 - those last two questions definitely in
114:22 - the live chat now or in the comments and
114:24 - the video later on please I invite you
114:28 - know any anyone watching this to join in
114:33 - that discussion as well as I said I
114:34 - don't have a lot of experience with
114:37 - angular so I would appreciate someone
114:39 - who maybe has more experience with both
114:42 - giving their opinion on that Patrick
114:47 - asked what was the name of a newsmen
114:48 - park you took your kids to I went to
114:50 - some near you as a kid but don't
114:51 - remember the names yeah actually it was
114:54 - called Idlewild it's in Ligonier
114:57 - Pennsylvania so it was a there signs up
115:00 - all over Idlewild saying that it was
115:02 - voted the best children's amusement park
115:05 - in the world which I don't know I'm not
115:09 - really sure like how that who votes for
115:12 - that right but anyway it is pretty good
115:15 - X if you're anywhere near Pennsylvania
115:19 - and it's Ligonier is kind of near
115:21 - Pittsburgh Pennsylvania so it's in the
115:23 - like the south western corner of
115:26 - Pennsylvania but if you're anywhere near
115:29 - there and you have kids definitely check
115:32 - it out it's really cool there's a water
115:34 - park and an amusement park so there's a
115:36 - lot of rides the smaller kids can ride
115:38 - to not really like very many big roller
115:42 - coasters or anything so if you're into
115:44 - like really fast scary roller coasters
115:46 - that's not really the place to go
115:48 - but if you have little ones that can't
115:50 - ride those kind of rollercoasters anyway
115:53 - Idlewild it's a place to go if your kids
115:55 - like mr. Rogers or like Daniel Tiger's
115:58 - neighborhood they have a whole like you
116:01 - can take a ride on trolley and they take
116:03 - you into Daniel cider Tigers
116:04 - neighborhood and really cool like my one
116:08 - of my my sons is he's about to turn
116:11 - three next week and he loves Daniel
116:14 - Tigers so that was super fun taking him
116:16 - through the ride on trolley so been
116:20 - anyway really cool my only complaints
116:22 - about the entire place or the the food
116:24 - is so expensive which i think is normal
116:27 - for amusement parks like you get in
116:28 - there and like they charge you like
116:32 - double which you would normally pay for
116:33 - something and it's not even good so the
116:36 - food is expensive and not really that
116:37 - good I didn't I didn't like that also it
116:41 - was weird they had they were playing
116:42 - music at various like parts of the park
116:45 - and the some of the music had profanity
116:49 - in it and it's like this place is
116:51 - marketed as a family-friendly like
116:53 - little kids theme park and I thought
116:56 - that was odd that they would choose to
116:59 - play music like that around around
117:03 - children
117:04 - so other other than those two things I
117:07 - have no complaints I've been there I
117:09 - went there when I was a kid and now I've
117:13 - I've taken my kids there for a few years
117:16 - now so anyway totally not related to
117:19 - coding but it may be useful to youth if
117:23 - you're near Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
117:31 - Alberto says traversée media also has
117:37 - videos web dev videos and I'm assuming
117:42 - that this is in regard to the videos
117:44 - about sass Oh Sara says try level up
117:51 - sucks yeah you're right yes Sara they
117:55 - definitely have videos on that I totally
117:57 - forgot about them
118:07 - I John Hansen says I you sass love it
118:10 - best way to learn it is to use node sass
118:13 - in production with a linter it's the
118:16 - fastest way to learn it yeah that's what
118:23 - I think that's how I had it set up as
118:30 - well yeah I normally do you sass I just
118:32 - didn't never set it up for this project
118:34 - so in future projects I'll most likely
118:37 - be using sass so if you're interested in
118:39 - learning more about sass it will be
118:42 - coming
118:54 - well okay rollin looked it up and said s
118:57 - CSS and sass syntax are being they're
119:00 - developed in parallel so that's cool
119:02 - when they actually have four different
119:03 - styles that's cool I never really okay
119:07 - and so sass is the original syntax and
119:10 - it's still supported and then s CSS is a
119:14 - CSS compatible format and it's the
119:17 - default format for sass three and up so
119:21 - okay cool so I wasn't just making it up
119:25 - it was that that was actually then so I
119:28 - was I was mistaken and the fact that I
119:30 - didn't realize that it was still being
119:32 - developed but it was the original one
119:35 - all right Amelio asked it's a question
119:40 - that could be difficult to answer but
119:41 - how much money does an advanced front
119:43 - end of make an hour all right so I don't
119:47 - yeah this is going to be difficult to
119:50 - answer obviously as as everyone knows it
119:53 - does depend on you know where your
119:55 - location is and things like that and
119:58 - also I don't know that I would consider
120:03 - myself an advanced front-end dev so I
120:05 - can't speak from experience to that but
120:07 - I will say my hourly rate ends up so I
120:16 - make a salad salary so but I have
120:18 - calculated my hourly rate before and I
120:22 - think if you factor in I think if you
120:29 - factor
120:33 - depending on whether or not you factor
120:35 - in my benefits and things like that I
120:37 - think I make between thirty and forty
120:39 - dollars an hour for what I do right now
120:42 - and that's like assuming that I'm not
120:46 - working any extra which currently I am
120:48 - working a lot of overtime that I don't
120:50 - like it's not I don't really make extra
120:53 - money for overtime so yeah so right now
120:58 - it's somewhere between thirty and forty
120:59 - dollars an hour for me
121:04 - freelance I can make more than that so
121:09 - now of course when you're freelancing
121:12 - like there's there's a whole there's all
121:16 - kind of extra overhead that goes into
121:17 - things that makes it not as desirable I
121:21 - guess like you you know you have to
121:22 - handle all your business taxes and
121:26 - client invoicing and contracts and
121:29 - things so there's extra headache that
121:33 - goes with that but I would say like as a
121:39 - freelancer depending on who the client
121:43 - is like if they're nonprofit or not and
121:45 - what kind of work I'm doing it would
121:47 - fluctuate but like right now I would I
121:51 - probably even for a non-profit
121:54 - I wouldn't think about taking any
121:56 - project that would be like below fifty
121:59 - dollars an hour and I don't even know if
122:02 - I would go that low but right now I'm
122:04 - really busy I don't have a lot of time
122:06 - if I had more time I don't know maybe I
122:08 - think about it or if it was a really
122:10 - good cause and they didn't have any
122:11 - money I would maybe think about corn
122:13 - lower but realistically for like a
122:16 - business client like my price range per
122:19 - hour is is around a hundred a hundred
122:23 - dollars an hour if I lived in a like a
122:26 - big city it would be higher than that
122:28 - but the area that I live in has a pretty
122:32 - low cost of living for in terms of like
122:36 - the United States standard of living so
122:39 - I think I can get away with that but if
122:43 - I was in a bigger you know if I was in
122:45 - San Francisco I doubled
122:46 - for sure I don't know if I could make
122:48 - that or not but the cost of living there
122:50 - is so much more expensive I would
122:53 - definitely go more so I don't know if
122:55 - any anyone else has anything that to add
122:57 - into that but that's been my experience
122:58 - personally with you know pricing and
123:02 - things and I know there's like it's hard
123:07 - to find like reliable data I've seen a
123:09 - lot of studies and different things
123:10 - about like what do front-end devs really
123:12 - make but I always just wonder how
123:14 - reliable it is so I'm not sure but
123:18 - anyway Emilio I hope that helped to
123:20 - answer your question a bit I will say
123:22 - this so you did ask about an advanced
123:25 - front-end dev but I think it might be
123:27 - helpful to talk about like it just
123:29 - starting out and say like when I was
123:32 - just starting out I worked for $10 an
123:35 - hour doing like I guess it was kind of
123:41 - front-end dev work it I did like barely
123:45 - any like JavaScript coding and more like
123:47 - some basic like CSS HTML stuff but I
123:51 - started out at dollars an hour so
123:54 - there's definitely quite a range
124:14 - all right cool I just saw Jay said
124:16 - Jessie thanks for your great advice I'll
124:18 - get with react now all right cool
124:21 - yes I mean I'm not like I said I don't
124:24 - think I'm an expert with reacting for
124:26 - sure I'm not an expert with angular but
124:29 - yeah I do
124:31 - I am confident enough to recommend going
124:34 - with react I think you'll be you'll be
124:35 - happy with it there's a lot of jobs for
124:37 - react developers right now so I've had
124:41 - fun using it so far Rowen says you never
124:46 - completely learn anything in a coding
124:48 - world there's always new things changes
124:50 - etc there are features like map and
124:52 - reduce that are es6 plus and that you
124:55 - will be fine without knowing them yeah
124:57 - that's definitely true I hadn't even
124:59 - thought of that but realistically like
125:01 - javascript is a changing language so
125:04 - it's it's not even a reasonable goal to
125:06 - say you would want to learn you know
125:08 - let's learn JavaScript like you don't
125:10 - just learn JavaScript
125:12 - because it's changing and so you could
125:17 - never just learn it and have know it all
125:25 - oh cool so Patrick has been to the same
125:29 - amusement park that I took my kids do so
125:32 - cool it's uh there are parts of it that
125:36 - have not changed at all since I went
125:38 - there when I was a kid and then if
125:41 - they've certainly added a lot on since
125:42 - then but it's kind of cool that there
125:44 - are still parts that look exactly the
125:46 - same
125:50 - Rowan says amusement parks and movie
125:53 - theaters charging ten times the price
125:54 - for stuff not worth the original price
125:57 - that's for sure yeah to me it's like I
126:00 - mean I realized like as a business
126:02 - they're just trying to make a lot of
126:03 - money but I wouldn't I wouldn't be as
126:06 - upset if the food that they charged so
126:09 - much for was really good like I don't
126:12 - mind paying money for things that are of
126:15 - good quality and they're worth the money
126:17 - but if you're charging more and then the
126:21 - food is just bad it's like bet that
126:26 - upsets me like obviously like they
126:28 - you're paying enough that they could get
126:31 - better quality ingredients
126:32 - you know they but they don't jordan asks
126:40 - what about less so if you're not
126:42 - familiar with less or sass for that
126:44 - matter those are CSS preprocessors so
126:48 - basically it's it's a way to let you do
126:50 - things to help you write CSS faster and
126:54 - do things that you normally can't do in
126:57 - CSS like have variables and do different
127:00 - types of you know like things that are
127:03 - closer to which you can do in a
127:05 - programming language but being able to
127:07 - do it with CSS so less is one type of
127:13 - preprocessor sass is another type of
127:16 - free processors so some people you says
127:19 - some people use less I personally have
127:21 - never used less so I can't really
127:23 - comment too much about it it seems like
127:26 - the trend is towards sass so if you are
127:30 - gonna start to learn something now I
127:32 - would say go with sass but you know for
127:36 - instance bootstrap the
127:37 - popular you know library like CSS
127:42 - framework library is they used to use
127:46 - less and with the newest version of
127:48 - bootstrap they're moving to sass so like
127:51 - you know things like that where you know
127:54 - big frameworks are switching from less
127:56 - to sass leading me to believe that sass
127:59 - would be the better way to go but I've
128:01 - even heard people talk about not even
128:04 - using that anymore that CSS as a
128:07 - language is starting to support things
128:09 - so I think sass will still be useful for
128:11 - years enough people use it in projects
128:15 - that it's not going to go anywhere
128:16 - anytime soon
128:17 - at some point yes regular CSS will
128:20 - probably catch up and browsers will
128:22 - catch up and perhaps you won't need the
128:24 - things that sass can do but for now at
128:28 - least I though I still think is pretty
128:30 - useful
128:33 - Sahra asks what would be the best way or
128:36 - resource to start learning react after
128:38 - learning basic JavaScript
128:40 - I guess code Academy has a beginners
128:45 - course on react free code campus react
128:48 - stuff Udacity has a course and reacts
128:51 - that that is paid the the first two are
128:54 - free those would be good ways to start
128:58 - out with and react create react app and
129:04 - the react documentation are a great ways
129:07 - to get started in it if you need certain
129:10 - features like server-side rendering or
129:12 - routing built in you could start with
129:14 - next Jas and it helps you kind of get
129:16 - started without having to learn all the
129:18 - you know web pack and and things which
129:22 - can be kind of confusing at first there
129:26 - are a lot of good videos on react so
129:29 - those are my it's not super specific of
129:33 - a list but I think those are good ways
129:37 - to start out with and there's somebody
129:44 - last week at some point in a live chat
129:47 - somebody posted a link to a great
129:49 - resource on git
129:50 - that had all these different things to
129:52 - learn I believe it was react I can't
129:57 - remember what that link was though it's
130:01 - possible I still have it up on my
130:02 - computer somewhere but I have a lot of
130:03 - tabs and windows open so I hope maybe if
130:08 - I can find it I'll post it in the
130:10 - description for this video I can't
130:12 - promise that I'll be able to find it
130:13 - because that's possible that I closed it
130:15 - out and but I do think I starred that
130:18 - repo I did start it so yeah so maybe
130:26 - I'll try to find it among when I start
130:28 - repos and post it in the chat and if you
130:31 - want to you can send me a message a
130:33 - direct message on Twitter to remind me
130:36 - about that and then I can just send you
130:38 - the link to that resource as well if
130:41 - you'd like
130:53 - my guess what would you give for the
130:56 - hundred dollars per hour I mean what
130:59 - level of a site okay so yeah so the site
131:08 - if it was $100 an hour I mean probably
131:13 - this type of site that I would be doing
131:15 - would be like a react site and that's
131:20 - why it to me at this point $100 an hour
131:23 - that it's not so much of a level of like
131:26 - this is this is what you would get but
131:28 - more of that's what that's what it would
131:32 - take to make it worthwhile for me to
131:35 - take more time because I already have a
131:36 - full time job that's more than full time
131:38 - often you know I'm often working extra
131:41 - and I'm taking a course on the side and
131:44 - I have some some clients on the side
131:46 - that I'd be recurring work for you know
131:48 - and I just I already wish I had more
131:50 - time for my kids and my family and so
131:57 - for me to even consider taking any more
132:01 - time away from my family to do something
132:04 - it would have to be worthwhile in terms
132:06 - of bringing in more money for my family
132:09 - like a reasonable amount of money so
132:13 - that I could in my mind I could say well
132:15 - I'm gonna make at least make their lives
132:17 - a little bit better by bringing in this
132:19 - money and it's it's probably a poor
132:23 - trade-off I don't know if this is the
132:24 - right way to think about it but it's
132:26 - like well if I can't be with them for
132:27 - that hour like I at least want to be
132:29 - able to say like I'm gonna provide some
132:31 - security for them or be able to give
132:33 - them something that you know it's gonna
132:35 - at least make up a bit for that and I
132:39 - got to think like well I need to be able
132:41 - to pay someone to like take care of my
132:43 - let my lawn you know cut the grass or do
132:45 - repairs on my house because I'm gonna be
132:47 - working and I won't have time to do that
132:49 - so it's not so much like I wouldn't
132:53 - explain it like this to a client but for
132:56 - my point of view the price that I said
132:59 - is like what is it going to take to get
133:02 - me to do that
133:03 - from and if a client wants to pay me
133:05 - that much they're gonna recognize like I
133:07 - really want this guy to do my site
133:08 - because he's good or whatever and what
133:14 - is it gonna take for me to get Jesse to
133:16 - do my site now if I was really going
133:20 - after clients which I'm not and I was
133:22 - trying to market myself to clients I
133:24 - would put it in terms like this is the
133:28 - value that the site's going to bring to
133:29 - you like you're gonna get so many more
133:32 - customers you're gonna sell so many
133:34 - units of this product or service and so
133:37 - this site is gonna actually bring you
133:38 - you know let's say this much money like
133:41 - let's just say like this sites gonna
133:43 - bring you in another like 50 thousand
133:45 - dollars a year and you're only gonna pay
133:47 - me ten thousand dollars or something so
133:51 - I'm gonna bring value so if I had to
133:53 - explain it to a client in terms of value
133:55 - I would explain it like that but you
133:59 - know in terms of my own motivation for
134:01 - it it's entirely based on like I just
134:03 - don't have that much time so it needs to
134:06 - be worth my while for me to work on it
134:09 - so it's kind of an odd I don't know it's
134:13 - kind of an odd situation when I was
134:15 - freelancing it was it was a different
134:17 - thing it was like I need to set a price
134:19 - that's fair for me but it's still
134:21 - competitive so that I can actually get
134:24 - clients so there's a whole different
134:26 - ballgame but when when you have enough
134:31 - work I really feel like the only
134:34 - reasonable way to set your price is like
134:37 - what's my time worth to me and the
134:40 - busier you are the more your time is
134:42 - going to be worth so my my rate of what
134:45 - I'm willing to work for change is based
134:47 - on how busy I am
134:53 - but I will say when I get when I get
134:57 - paid well to do a job I I do a good job
135:00 - I'm obviously not just in it for the
135:03 - money like I want to work on projects
135:05 - that are things that I'm interested in
135:07 - and I want to do a really good job on
135:10 - them so I don't really feel bad about
135:14 - charging more because I think people are
135:17 - getting a really good product from the
135:22 - work that I do hopefully that answered
135:30 - your question Mike dono asks can I get a
135:34 - job after completing front-end so I'm
135:36 - assuming that means like the front end
135:38 - certificate from free code camp I've
135:40 - heard of a lot of people I guess I don't
135:43 - know a lot is a relative term but I have
135:45 - I know that there are people who have
135:48 - gotten jobs after completing the front
135:50 - end certificate so obviously it's not a
135:53 - guarantee that you can get a job but if
135:55 - you check out the free code camp forum
135:57 - you'll see stories of people that have
136:00 - done just that and I would recommend
136:02 - that check out their stories see kind of
136:04 - what they did how they went about trying
136:06 - to find a job after they completed the
136:08 - certificate and that'll give you a
136:10 - better idea of if that's you know how
136:14 - close is their experience to your
136:15 - experience you know and give you a
136:17 - better idea what your chances are
136:18 - realistically of getting a job but but
136:21 - it definitely happens people do get jobs
136:23 - after the completing the front end
136:25 - certificate rhoann does says freelance
136:29 - depends on area of expertise location
136:31 - experience connections yeah don't
136:34 - underestimate the connections thing your
136:37 - your freelance the amount of work you
136:39 - can get and how much you can charge is
136:40 - definitely depending on your connections
136:42 - my best clients were just came from
136:45 - connections
136:52 - Emilia says thanks Jessie I've set my
136:54 - projects very low so I would take your
136:57 - advice I mainly do WordPress sites with
137:00 - strong design okay cool yeah hopefully
137:08 - and I mean it's it's it's hard to set
137:10 - your rate based on what other people are
137:12 - doing especially if they're not in the
137:14 - same market and to like geographically
137:16 - years so I guess the best thing that to
137:20 - do would be try to figure out what
137:23 - people in your own area are charging or
137:26 - or in like the area that you're
137:27 - targeting because you you know you can
137:30 - do remote work for people somewhere else
137:31 - like I ended up doing remote work mostly
137:34 - for people in around New York City
137:36 - because I could charge more and they
137:40 - that was a reasonable thing around where
137:42 - I was at people would freak out if they
137:45 - were gonna pay me $100 an hour they just
137:48 - didn't understand the cost of a quality
137:50 - website and the value of it so I just I
137:54 - completely just quit trying to get
137:56 - clients in my own area because it wasn't
138:00 - worth my time you know to try to put in
138:02 - all the effort to get a new client and
138:05 - make a contract and all that stuff and
138:08 - have preliminary meetings when they
138:10 - wanted to spend you know $200 and get a
138:12 - website you'll get an e-commerce website
138:14 - for $200 with you know that's just if
138:18 - they wanted that that's fine but I
138:20 - wasn't gonna be the guy that was going
138:21 - to do that for him
138:45 - okay all right there's some links so
138:52 - hopefully we had some people ask about
138:54 - react and there's been some some links
138:56 - put in there so there's some github
139:01 - repos so once called awesome react
139:03 - another repo is react Redux links so
139:09 - search for those on github and this will
139:12 - have a lot of information for you about
139:14 - resources for learning react
139:22 - alright so Mike says okay that makes
139:24 - sense I would love to go into doing some
139:26 - freelance just do not know where to be
139:29 - in finding clients alongside the two
139:32 - companies I'm already running and I'm
139:34 - terrible pricing yeah it it takes a lot
139:38 - I think it just takes time to get good
139:41 - with trying to estimate prices like just
139:43 - experience and to get the confidence to
139:45 - be able to go in and say like you know
139:47 - this is how much it's gonna cost and it
139:50 - was it was really tough for me at first
139:51 - starting out you know it's for all that
139:54 - stuff and it does it helps a lot now
139:58 - that I
139:58 - I don't like need the money in it really
140:02 - helps helps you be a lot more confident
140:04 - when you're in negotiations with a
140:06 - client like to just say like hey this is
140:10 - this is my price take it or leave it
140:12 - and be confident knowing that you could
140:13 - walk away and you'd be fine you can
140:15 - still pay all your bills but that's I
140:19 - don't know that there's anything you can
140:21 - just do to get good at that right away
140:23 - it's just it just takes time
140:31 - Emilia says I now charge two thousand US
140:34 - dollars approximately for a wordpress
140:36 - site that has some heavy design on it in
140:37 - some functionality that's cool yet and I
140:41 - would say especially with WordPress
140:43 - sites I thereof I have seen freelancers
140:46 - like seeing their websites where they
140:48 - have it set up that that they'll charge
140:50 - a certain amount of money per WordPress
140:52 - site and they have it like very
140:54 - structured to say like the client owes
140:58 - them this amount of money and this
141:00 - content and these materials by a certain
141:02 - date and then they deliver on a certain
141:05 - date and any deviation is not allowed in
141:08 - the contract like it's in the contract
141:10 - and so that they are really and they're
141:12 - booked up and they know exactly what
141:14 - work they're going to be doing for
141:15 - months in advance and if a client wants
141:18 - them to do the work they have to meet
141:20 - the requirements in terms of getting the
141:24 - content and the payments in on time
141:26 - that's really a nice set up and then you
141:29 - know you can do a wordpress site for
141:30 - $2000 if you have it like that the the
141:33 - problem I found sometimes is you do a
141:36 - site and you have a client that drags
141:38 - their feet you know they're they don't
141:40 - get you the right content needed or they
141:43 - don't get back to you with important
141:44 - questions that you know you need the
141:46 - answers to for a really long time so
141:48 - that a site that should have taken you
141:51 - know a small amount of time and all of a
141:52 - sudden drags out it's months and months
141:54 - and months and it messes up your other
141:57 - projects it's hard to so I suppose I
142:02 - wouldn't be as opposed to doing like
142:04 - smaller sites if I had some type of
142:06 - structure set up like that to where I
142:09 - knew I would I would turn over sites
142:12 - quicker I I mean if you're gonna do know
142:17 - it just is just basic math right if
142:19 - you're gonna do smaller sites for less
142:21 - money you need to be able to do a lot of
142:22 - them or you could try to go for really
142:25 - big projects they're gonna be a lot of
142:27 - money and you know take up months and
142:29 - months to do them so either way I like
142:33 - if you need to pay the bills you take
142:34 - whatever you can get and I've been there
142:36 - and
142:37 - but I think Emilio I think that's not
142:39 - bad you know $2,000 for WordPress site
142:42 - as long as you can you know get the
142:44 - site's finished quickly enough you know
142:46 - that's that's good money
142:51 - rohan says a good recruiter will value
142:53 - modern online learning tools like free
142:55 - code camp udemy etc free code campus
142:57 - trusted yeah this was in regard to the
143:00 - question about can I get a job with the
143:02 - free code camp certificate and that's
143:05 - true yeah I think some companies still
143:08 - like don't realize how things are well
143:11 - in terms of like developers in their
143:13 - education and they still require you
143:17 - know traditional degrees and stuff but a
143:19 - lot of newer companies tech companies
143:22 - and things they understand how things
143:23 - really work and that it's much more
143:25 - important that someone can do the work
143:27 - and so you're you're more likely to get
143:31 - a job with a certificate for free code
143:34 - camp at one of those type of companies
143:36 - then maybe like kind of you're more
143:38 - old-school traditional companies
143:41 - so yeah Rohan is entirely correct and
143:45 - saying good good recruiters that know
143:47 - what's going on will realize that a free
143:50 - code camp certificate is a good
143:53 - indication of of what a good developer
143:56 - can do Amelia said I've made mistakes of
144:02 - putting that same price on the same
144:04 - level with PHP apps yeah yeah definitely
144:11 - and that takes time to realize like with
144:13 - different types of things like how much
144:15 - time it will take in different things so
144:17 - you just got to get a feel for that the
144:21 - level of customization that a client
144:23 - wants will definitely make it so much it
144:28 - can take something that's gonna be so
144:29 - easy and make it so difficult that
144:32 - that's happened to me so many times that
144:34 - I haven't taken a time upfront to get an
144:37 - idea of what a client expects and then
144:40 - the project ends up taking longer and
144:43 - I've had to go back to the client
144:44 - sometimes and say like this is outside
144:46 - the scope like we're gonna have to
144:48 - renegotiate you know and sometimes
144:52 - clients are okay with that sometimes
144:54 - they get really upset about that so
144:57 - definitely better to I kind of think
144:59 - it's better to overestimate upfront how
145:01 - long it's gonna take you it's much
145:04 - easier and it's happier on a client if
145:06 - you get to the end of the project and
145:07 - you feel like wow I this this was so
145:10 - easy and it didn't take me very long at
145:12 - all I feel bad taking this much money
145:14 - from a person if you need to to clear
145:17 - your conscience you can always give
145:18 - money back and the client will be really
145:20 - really happy and they'll probably tell
145:21 - everybody how awesome you are but if you
145:24 - underestimate and that halfway through
145:25 - the project you have to say listen I
145:27 - can't do any more work on this unless
145:29 - you pay me more the clients gonna be mad
145:31 - you know that even even if they're a
145:34 - really good client they're still not
145:35 - gonna like the fact that now to them
145:37 - it's over budget and you're less likely
145:40 - to get referrals so it's after years of
145:46 - going through it my advice would be
145:48 - always always overestimate the amount of
145:51 - time and money something's going to take
145:52 - if the clients still okay with that
145:55 - then that's probably great and they're
145:56 - gonna be a good client for you and I
145:59 - have had the situation before where I
146:00 - overestimated a lot and I gave the
146:03 - client money back or I simply said like
146:05 - in the case of if they hadn't billed
146:08 - them yet i billed him for way less than
146:10 - i said i was gonna build him for because
146:13 - and I just explained like this ended up
146:15 - taking being way easier than I expected
146:17 - you know here and and that built up a
146:20 - lot of trust and I ended up get getting
146:22 - paid way more later on for future
146:24 - projects from that client because I was
146:28 - willing to give you know I think I
146:30 - charged them I think I said I was going
146:33 - to charge them $200 and I only charged a
146:35 - month $100 which is a 50% discount
146:38 - that's big but at the end of the day
146:40 - it's tolling a hundred bucks I ended up
146:42 - making well over ten thousand dollars
146:44 - total from that client over the course
146:47 - of you know the time that I worked with
146:49 - them so in the grand scheme of things
146:51 - that hundred bucks wasn't a big deal but
146:53 - it really helped build up trust with
146:55 - that client that they were like willing
146:57 - to trust me with even bigger projects
147:08 - mayor dad asks where can I find the
147:11 - first essence of live coding yeah the
147:14 - very first sessions are on my youtube
147:16 - channel so it's a the link to it is in
147:22 - the description
147:23 - I think it's Jesse or waggle is then the
147:26 - channel name but I can't remember for
147:29 - sure but anyway the first few videos for
147:31 - this project are there so that was
147:35 - before I started I started the project
147:38 - before I started doing videos for free
147:39 - code ken Jeremy says well I've been
147:45 - working and had my volume down and you
147:48 - guys are still going awesome cool
147:51 - alright glad you're back Jeremy did you
147:53 - start your new job yet if so how's it
147:55 - going if not when are you gonna start
148:01 - Rowan says being in traditional learning
148:03 - environment currently so Rowan's right
148:05 - now in a traditional environment and
148:08 - having worked with people on real-world
148:10 - projects the difference is astounding
148:14 - and Santa says I agree rhoann working on
148:17 - real-time projects is the best way to
148:19 - learn yeah I mean I work at a college
148:22 - and I still agree like you learn a lot
148:25 - by actually doing things so that's that
148:29 - is the best way I mean there's
148:31 - definitely value in some degrees more
148:34 - than those of others of course but
148:37 - there's certain situations where you do
148:39 - want a degree but if you want to be like
148:42 - a front-end developer that's a job where
148:45 - I would say you most likely don't need a
148:48 - degree and if if you want the degree
148:52 - then you know maybe you have a good
148:54 - reason but I don't think it's necessary
148:58 - hey my it's here hey how's it going and
149:02 - aim high also has a new job so how is
149:06 - your job going to
149:10 - so I'm gonna wait I'm actually at the
149:13 - end of the live chat now but I've asked
149:15 - some questions of people so I'm gonna
149:16 - wait maybe just a few more seconds to
149:18 - see if I get any responses and then
149:19 - after that I'm just gonna add so I'll
149:22 - kind of give my ending some of my ending
149:25 - remarks right now while I'm waiting on a
149:27 - response but anyway yeah if you haven't
149:31 - gotten a question in and you still want
149:34 - to ask some questions you can put it in
149:36 - the comments for this video or you can
149:38 - direct message me on Twitter or just
149:40 - regular message me on Twitter I'd be
149:43 - happy to answer you know whenever I get
149:46 - a chance and oh I actually got some more
149:51 - stuff in the live chat now so Jeremy
149:55 - said I did start it's going good got
149:57 - some great workers and fun projects
150:00 - awesome I'm really glad to hear that yes
150:04 - so you'll have to keep us updated on the
150:07 - projects never I won't but I won't bug
150:09 - you about it every time but occasionally
150:11 - I will ask you how things are going and
150:14 - yeah that's um I don't know I just get
150:19 - super excited every time I hear that one
150:21 - of you have you know gotten a job and
150:22 - stuff that's that's really cool it's
150:25 - really cool to be able to get paid every
150:28 - day to do something that you really love
150:31 - that's kind of that's a great situation
150:37 - Jeremy said boss asked me to do some
150:40 - public speaking at high schools to get
150:41 - young generations motivated that's
150:44 - awesome that sounds really cool that's a
150:47 - really great idea that's that's cool
150:48 - that your bosses is interested in that
150:50 - so yeah that's awesome hopefully you
150:55 - have some success with that and get some
150:57 - I know it can be hard to speak I used to
151:00 - teach at high school so I know it can be
151:02 - hard to speak to high school kids but
151:06 - the good good luck with that
151:14 - Daniel says I want a front-end job to
151:16 - help me find for my degree I'm not
151:27 - exactly sure what what you're saying
151:29 - Daniel so maybe I'm just reading it
151:32 - wrong or whatever but if you want to
151:34 - rephrase it try to help me understand
151:37 - please please do so Rowland so it's the
151:42 - only good thing that happened to me with
151:44 - uni is making new friends yeah that's
151:46 - true you do get you make friends
151:48 - Joseph said and don't forget the beer
151:50 - yeah this that's true
151:54 - College seems to be the place where a
151:56 - lot of alcohol gets consumed all right
152:03 - EMI who also got the new job says it's
152:05 - been brilliant learn lots of good
152:07 - commands first week branching pool
152:09 - requests you name it my learning has
152:10 - just begun and all AK is awesome
152:14 - alright that's great that sounds cool
152:16 - yeah I get get is super super super
152:19 - helpful if any of you don't know how to
152:21 - use git yet especially from the command
152:23 - line I recommend you know learning that
152:26 - it's just it's really useful and a lot
152:30 - of jobs in the Job Description they like
152:35 - candidates that know how to use git and
152:39 - slack is definitely awesome I enjoy
152:41 - using slack brian says hi Jesse I'm a
152:45 - data scientist and wanted to know what
152:48 - your thoughts on using both R and
152:50 - JavaScript really want to go forward
152:52 - with three code Campbell will it add
152:53 - value I don't really have a lot of
152:56 - experience with R so I don't think I can
152:58 - give you a good answer I will say though
153:01 - in terms of JavaScript it seems like
153:03 - JavaScript is is being used in more and
153:06 - more places so I don't think it's it's
153:10 - ever kind of a waste to learn more about
153:12 - JavaScript because it's so versatile you
153:15 - know because I mean obviously anybody
153:16 - with a web browser like you can write
153:19 - stuff in JavaScript and they can use it
153:20 - so I mean that just puts it everywhere
153:22 - right away but there's also Internet
153:24 - things devices that you can program in
153:28 - JavaScript so and then with with things
153:33 - like react native you know mobile apps
153:35 - can be in JavaScript and VR can be in
153:37 - JavaScript and so I don't think it would
153:40 - be a waste to learn to do JavaScript
153:43 - things although if there was something
153:45 - really specific that you wanted to do
153:47 - that didn't necessarily need JavaScript
153:50 - then maybe you it would be more valuable
153:53 - to spend your time learning other things
153:56 - so it does somewhat depend on what you
153:59 - want to do but there you know there are
154:01 - just a lot of opportunities and jobs
154:03 - that use JavaScript that I mean
154:06 - generally speaking in most situations I
154:10 - don't think it would be a waste to learn
154:13 - JavaScript I think it would add value
154:15 - but like I said I can't say for sure in
154:17 - terms of data science and using our with
154:20 - JavaScript because I don't really have
154:21 - experience or very much knowledge of
154:23 - that so sorry I couldn't give you a
154:25 - better answer on that Brian Jordan says
154:29 - his bootstrap good to use yeah I think
154:31 - bootstrap is pretty good oz Anna say and
154:34 - she's gonna go to sleep all right good
154:37 - night Anna thanks for joining us thanks
154:39 - for all your contributions in the live
154:41 - stream are in the live chat I mean but
154:46 - back to bootstrap yeah Jordan I think
154:48 - bootstrap is a pretty among you know
154:51 - framework CSS frameworks like that
154:52 - bootstrap I think is one of the better
154:54 - ones so I don't use bootstrap currently
154:58 - for any projects I have used it before
155:00 - though and I think it's a good it's a
155:05 - good framework Jessica added that
155:08 - foundation it's also another framework
155:13 - that's good yeah I've Foundation seems
155:16 - to be pretty good as well and I use
155:20 - materialized it's not nearly as
155:23 - well-known as foundation and bootstrap
155:26 - but if you like material design
155:28 - materializes I think it did a decent
155:30 - option
155:35 - let's see one ass says really nice dream
155:40 - Jessie I'm in backend learning front end
155:42 - greetings from Peru hey thanks for
155:44 - joining us thanks for joining us from
155:46 - Peru and that's cool so you're already
155:49 - in back in and now you're learning front
155:50 - end that's really cool I feel like I'm
155:52 - going the opposite way that I'm I'm in
155:54 - front end and I'm learning some back end
155:56 - so welcome you'll definitely be able to
155:59 - contribute in in the chat and help me
156:02 - out with some backend stuff then
156:04 - occasionally I do need to do some
156:06 - backend things so I'm very much a
156:08 - beginner in that area so I welcome any
156:11 - any advice you have for me Roland says
156:15 - don't drink so no beer for me but yeah
156:17 - lots of beer was used in general yeah
156:19 - that's probably a better way to go I
156:21 - think you you probably learn a lot more
156:23 - in school if you weren't drinking then
156:26 - if you were I know some people who drank
156:30 - a lot in school and never and never got
156:33 - a degree but they drink a lot alcohol
156:37 - this is quite expensive thing expensive
156:42 - partying since they didn't end up with a
156:44 - degree anyway but still paid for one
156:47 - dancer daniel said I want a front end
156:50 - job to fund for my degree I don't want a
156:54 - student loan oh okay alright so Daniels
156:57 - saying wants to get the front end job be
156:59 - able to make money to pay for the degree
157:01 - without getting a student loan actually
157:03 - that's that's a pretty good idea
157:06 - so yeah cuz you can definitely do front
157:08 - end work you know freelance stuff remote
157:10 - work and still be able to do you know do
157:13 - school at the same time so yeah that's a
157:15 - great idea I was very lucky that I
157:17 - didn't I didn't have loans a lot of
157:19 - loans that hadn't paid back or anything
157:21 - but I have I have friends and family
157:23 - that just have so much money in student
157:27 - loans there and so much debt it's really
157:29 - hard to get out of the debt from a
157:32 - student loan and sometimes Roland says
157:36 - freelance websites alright so this is in
157:39 - terms of like how would how would you
157:41 - make money freelancing is freelance
157:45 - websites and ask your friends and family
157:46 - just
157:47 - read the word yeah definitely previous
157:49 - websites can be tough to make a lot of
157:51 - money off of it takes a while to build
157:53 - up your reputation on them but then yeah
157:56 - friends and family are really good if
157:59 - you have them to be able to you know
158:02 - just have you know they can just talk to
