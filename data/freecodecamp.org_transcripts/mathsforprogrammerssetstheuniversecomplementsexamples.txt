00:00 - in this video I'll be going over
00:01 - examples of complements so in this video
00:04 - I've defined the universe to be the
00:07 - integers 1 through five and it's denoted
00:10 - graphically by this blue line and if we
00:12 - recall the definition of uh the
00:15 - complements with or with regards to a we
00:18 - have a complement equals the set
00:20 - containing elements X such that X is an
00:23 - element of the universe and X is not an
00:26 - element of a so in that case we can look
00:30 - at uh all the integers 1 through 5 and
00:34 - if it contains any element from a we
00:37 - throw it out so uh in this case if we
00:40 - look at the integer one we know that
00:42 - that's not going to be there because
00:43 - that's an a if we look at uh the integer
00:46 - two that'll be in our set we look at the
00:49 - integer three that won't be in our set
00:51 - because that's also an A and then four
00:54 - and five are uh within the universe and
00:56 - they're not within a next we have B
00:59 - compliment
01:00 - well we know that 1 2 4 and five are
01:04 - within the universe and they're not
01:06 - within uh
01:08 - B and lastly we have C complement two
01:12 - four and five are within the universe
01:15 - and they're not within C because we had
01:17 - to exclude one and three
