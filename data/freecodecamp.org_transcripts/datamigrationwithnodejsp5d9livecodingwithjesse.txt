00:05 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're gonna
00:11 - move some data yesterday we spent some
00:14 - time looking at the database we saw the
00:18 - structure we started to write some
00:20 - JavaScript code with node to be able to
00:24 - pull that data out of the database and
00:26 - we ended up just pulling out a static
00:28 - JSON file and then we were gonna put it
00:32 - into wordpress with the wordpress api
00:34 - well since that time
00:37 - Harshit who's frequently in the live
00:40 - chat and also a frequent contributor
00:43 - Harshit wrote there kind of the rest of
00:48 - what we were planning on writing but he
00:50 - did it a little bit differently so the
00:52 - way harsha did it is we can pull data
00:54 - out directly out so basically we skip
00:57 - the step of exporting it as a JSON file
01:00 - first so we can pull the data directly
01:03 - out of the database using sequel queries
01:06 - right there in our node file we just put
01:09 - the query in as a string we'll check out
01:12 - the code in a minute I just wanted to
01:15 - give harsh that is proper thanks for
01:18 - this
01:19 - so basically pulls it out as a query and
01:22 - then it authenticates with WordPress so
01:26 - you can get data from the WordPress API
01:28 - without logging in but you can't put
01:30 - data in right that makes sense so we
01:34 - authenticate and add the data into
01:36 - WordPress and it's it actually worked so
01:40 - let me pull this over this test so I did
01:45 - access just with one piece of
01:48 - information I didn't want to go through
01:50 - all you know 9,000 plus rows but here we
01:55 - see this is that test WordPress
01:57 - installation that we made yesterday and
01:59 - the first piece of data that we had
02:03 - here's the correct title now here's the
02:06 - issue this is the HTML oh goodness I'm
02:12 - sorry
02:13 - and then change my screen alright now
02:16 - I've changed my screen so this is the
02:18 - correct title in our WordPress
02:20 - installation and then this is HTML and
02:26 - there's actually I don't even think
02:30 - there's content in here it's all just I
02:37 - guess these tags that are specifying
02:40 - what components are supposed to go in
02:42 - here so we're gonna have to look through
02:46 - some of these and see I guess like what
02:51 - where are we supposed to get this
02:52 - content from obviously we don't want to
02:55 - pull this in so we're gonna have to take
02:57 - a closer look at the data now so I've
02:59 - already started to do that and that's
03:00 - why I apologize are starting to scream a
03:03 - few minutes late but I got really into
03:05 - this and I just didn't realize how late
03:08 - it was so let's take a look at some of
03:15 - the data we have and we make it bigger
03:16 - so I can see so one thing that I found
03:20 - and this is what I was going right
03:23 - before it stream started is that the
03:26 - content type of 3 corresponds to I guess
03:33 - news yeah I think these are all news the
03:41 - content type for our current system
03:44 - Extron I think this would be categorized
03:46 - as news so we don't think we need news
03:57 - I guess we'll have to verify yeah all
04:07 - these seem like announcements just some
04:15 - of these now that I look at it
04:19 - potentially wouldn't be news hmm this
04:31 - might end up being a little bit tougher
04:33 - it seems as if there's not really
04:36 - separate post types mmm yeah this is
04:48 - still content type 3 I was I was afraid
04:52 - this would happen so let me explain a
04:58 - little bit about what what was done and
05:01 - this was before I even started working
05:03 - here from what I understand when this
05:10 - was was delivered from the company that
05:12 - built it meaning you know the Ektron
05:17 - content management system and the
05:19 - website there were pieces of it that
05:23 - were supposed to work a certain way and
05:31 - they didn't so what they ended up doing
05:35 - was using some let's say like some
05:39 - content types some post types for a lot
05:42 - of different things that they weren't
05:44 - originally meant for which worked at the
05:47 - time but the problem that we're gonna
05:48 - have to deal with now is that now when
05:54 - we have a content type that maybe this
05:57 - was originally supposed to just be from
05:59 - news or announcements but now it seems
06:03 - like they've used it also for employees
06:08 - like this is a faculty member so
06:11 - potentially this could be a faculty
06:15 - profile so we we need to find some way
06:30 - to figure that out or seize folder IDs
06:36 - 152 maybe the folder IDs would help us
06:44 - alright let's search for that right now
06:47 - we're inside 3 let's search by folder ID
06:53 - what was that 152 is that the one that I
06:56 - have found 152 all right where folder ID
07:08 - equals 150 - all right let's see what we
07:13 - get here
07:14 - whoa why are you making me log in again
07:18 - should I get disconnected
07:24 - well disconnected me pretty quickly
07:27 - all right yes yes yes yes this is much
07:34 - better
07:34 - okay so this is this is better let's cut
07:40 - this doing you notice for now I just I
07:46 - want to look at all this data so
07:47 - eventually we won't cut out the columns
07:50 - that we need but right now I'm looking
07:52 - for identifiers so that could help us
07:54 - group these together otherwise
07:57 - somebody's gonna have to go through it
07:58 - by hand so all of these look like
08:04 - they're faculty profiles these are all
08:09 - professors associate professors so
08:11 - that's good probably won't use the
08:14 - teaser because I want the full content
08:17 - so we don't need that row but the text
08:23 - you could figure out the text might be
08:32 - useful there so we have that content
08:34 - text we're not getting anything for the
08:39 - image we have the template oh yes that's
08:43 - unfortunate because these usually do
08:48 - have images attached so I mean that's
08:51 - not it'd be nice if the images came
08:54 - through as well but it's not the end of
08:56 - the world I don't want to double-check
08:59 - what the content hTML is here let's see
09:04 - what we get so I know this is probably
09:07 - too small for y'all to see I mean it's
09:09 - really really small for me I get my face
09:12 - really close if the HTML structure looks
09:15 - good then that's probably what I'll
09:17 - bring in is this content HTML call them
09:20 - if not then I'll try to bring in just
09:23 - the the text the plain text and we can
09:27 - always wrap it in a tag but this
09:29 - actually looks pretty good when it
09:33 - actually comes with an image tag with
09:35 - the image source in it so that's that's
09:38 - nice yeah that's really nice
09:47 - great and these also have some YouTube
09:50 - embeds attached as well and that's in
09:53 - there
09:53 - wonderful all right cool I think we have
09:55 - our first piece of data right so you
10:03 - know what let me go to live chat I see a
10:05 - lot of activity in here and I haven't
10:06 - looked at it yet so I'm gonna live chat
10:10 - maybe things will change if depending on
10:13 - what's happening in the chat but
10:15 - basically my my first idea here is let's
10:18 - make a custom post type and try a custom
10:22 - post type called faculty and we'll try
10:25 - to pull all these in and we will we'll
10:29 - cut down on the query here only pooling
10:31 - what we really need but we'll try to
10:33 - pull those in put them in WordPress and
10:36 - then see what we get
10:39 - all right so hey everybody everybody
10:41 - saying hi here at the beginning let's
10:46 - see ok cool Brian who works with me here
10:52 - is in the live chat so that's awesome
10:54 - because he actually put in a lot of this
10:58 - content himself or was in charge of
11:00 - directing other people to put the
11:02 - content in so he knows a lot more about
11:04 - this content how its structured some
11:07 - glad he's able to join ok so brian says
11:11 - originally what we are looking at those
11:12 - are those were events looks like some of
11:16 - them were also job postings he said look
11:20 - some of those were expired events which
11:21 - it's kind of what I thought because
11:23 - they're referencing you know things that
11:25 - happen you know two years ago deadlines
11:28 - for things let's see yes harness asking
11:36 - about what Ektron is based on Brian says
11:39 - duh it is it's dotnet so do you I don't
11:43 - know [ __ ] do you remember when we were
11:44 - editing some of those c-sharp templates
11:46 - you know a while back if I don't know if
11:50 - you're in those dreams or not but that's
11:52 - what would we were working with Ektron
11:56 - and the database is
12:00 - sequel server database let's see okay so
12:09 - hard [ __ ] stalking about the rose yeah
12:13 - yeah I will get rid of the rose but I
12:15 - needed them well before the stream
12:18 - started I needed them because I was
12:19 - trying to find that some type of
12:21 - identifier that would give consistent
12:25 - categories and I think that identified a
12:27 - might be folder ID I thought it would be
12:30 - content type but that's not that's not
12:33 - the case but folder ID metric might be a
12:36 - better way for us to go so now that I
12:38 - found that I can get rid of the rest of
12:40 - the columns that I don't need
12:44 - Harshit says remove all of the HTML
12:46 - using a regular expression or something
12:49 - yeah that's what I was thinking we
12:51 - should well potentially some of them the
12:54 - HTML is a mess but other ones like this
12:58 - the HTML is actually structured fairly
13:02 - well so I think we it might not be a bad
13:06 - idea to just keep it as is especially
13:09 - for some of these you know for instance
13:11 - for this one I know the tags are weird
13:15 - but it makes sense the name right and
13:19 - then we have an image and then below
13:21 - there's like a body and thing so that's
13:23 - how we would want to organize that
13:25 - anyway so I wouldn't probably wouldn't
13:29 - make these tags called name they'd just
13:32 - be spans or something but if it'll save
13:38 - us a lot of time I'm okay with bringing
13:40 - things in like this we could always
13:48 - change the names of those tags at some
13:50 - point if we really needed to
13:56 - okay so Brian says these are all
13:58 - philosophy faculty profiles that that
14:01 - makes sense now yeah okay
14:04 - actually that's great that's really
14:07 - great so do you all from one department
14:10 - this is awesome so what we can do then
14:12 - is
14:13 - we can have our faculty custom post type
14:17 - but then within that we'll have
14:19 - categories for the different departments
14:21 - so we can actually input those with the
14:24 - categories for the department which
14:26 - should save a lot of time of you know
14:29 - having to go in and have someone do that
14:31 - manually later on so that's great we'll
14:34 - just have to figure out which folder IDs
14:36 - correspond to which department and that
14:42 - then we'll be able to do it we may even
14:44 - be able to you know make some sort of a
14:47 - Oh in an array you know maybe some key
14:53 - value pairs that we can just check once
14:57 - we import it and then depending on what
15:04 - what ID we get you know would
15:07 - automatically assign that corresponding
15:09 - category
15:10 - I'll think about best way to do that but
15:13 - I this is good good news okay
15:24 - okay Brian saying the images also
15:27 - probably won't be very usable because
15:29 - they're very small yeah maybe it might
15:43 - still not be a bad idea to try at least
15:45 - see what those images are like I'm
15:49 - thinking like if it comes down to it
15:51 - right and we need to launch it we don't
15:53 - have that much time small images are
15:55 - better than no images we can make the UI
15:57 - and in such a way that maybe those small
16:00 - images will look okay and then after we
16:04 - launch we could certainly go back in and
16:06 - you know find higher quality images but
16:09 - the process of going through and finding
16:11 - good images for every faculty member you
16:15 - know it that may not be doable in the
16:18 - amount of time that we have so I I agree
16:22 - that those images will probably want to
16:24 - replace them but let's try to keep them
16:27 - for as long as we can and I do have
16:31 - access to all these files where these
16:33 - images are so I could very easily take
16:35 - all of those images put them into
16:37 - WordPress or wherever we want to host
16:40 - our images and then just go through and
16:42 - in bulk change all those image source
16:46 - URLs so that's what I'm thinking wound
16:49 - up doing right because obviously we're
16:52 - you know we're not gonna leave this
16:54 - server up where these images are now
16:57 - okay
16:58 - I should ask thief's equalised work
17:04 - efficiently with MS sequel yes it did it
17:08 - definitely did I had a little bit of
17:10 - trouble so the only trouble I had and so
17:14 - harsh its harsh it made a repo with all
17:19 - this and I forked it so it's now on the
17:21 - fus mark on github organization so you
17:26 - can check that out this is the newest
17:27 - repo I only had to change a few things
17:31 - so let's show let's get to the code now
17:33 - I am going to exit
17:35 - out of my config because I want
17:39 - everybody to see that but basically what
17:43 - I had to change is we were defining a
17:46 - port and in the config it was set as
17:51 - some other port I just got rid of it
17:54 - because the default port worked so since
17:59 - the default port work that was fine with
18:01 - me and that port would be it's not
18:05 - showing it enough anyway so figure you
18:11 - know what may as well save a line if
18:13 - it's going to give us a default that
18:14 - works we probably don't can take out now
18:29 - I don't remember what variable was there
18:31 - oh yeah I don't remember what variable
18:36 - was in the config I I assumed it was
18:38 - just DB port but anyway we don't need
18:41 - that so that's pretty much it that's all
18:44 - I had to change I'll go it through here
18:46 - there's nothing there's nothing else and
18:52 - I didn't really have to remove that line
18:53 - I could have just manually typed in the
18:55 - port in the config but like I said you
19:00 - know might as well you know take a line
19:02 - out if we can okay
19:12 - Brook says hi everyone bit late just got
19:15 - done eating a lot of fries that sounds
19:17 - good right now actually I could give her
19:20 - some fries
19:32 - okay all right
19:35 - I should shed his uh visual studio could
19:38 - set up yes so if you notice I'm using
19:42 - Visual Studio code partially for some
19:46 - reason that links not working for me I
19:47 - don't understand anyway so I have
19:56 - switched over to visual studio code I'm
19:58 - gonna try to work with this more I have
20:01 - noticed the the speed is better for
20:03 - visual studio code it is I know in the
20:07 - past I've been against the integrated
20:09 - terminal but for at least for the stream
20:12 - it's very nice to have this right here
20:15 - and not have to switch so I like it
20:21 - there's still times when I'll I still
20:25 - have my other terminal windows open on
20:27 - my other screen so and I think I'll
20:29 - continue to use both but this is nice it
20:32 - is pretty nice let me make this a bit
20:35 - bigger goodness
20:38 - alright and I don't need that there we
20:41 - go okay so just very quickly I'm gonna
20:45 - run through this before we start pulling
20:49 - stuff over so if maybe you're not that
20:52 - familiar with node you know maybe you
20:54 - wouldn't be able to just read this and
20:55 - know what's going on we'll go through it
20:58 - so we are using some packages here know
21:00 - to fetch which we talked about yesterday
21:02 - sequel eyes so sequel eyes is pretty
21:10 - obvious I think from the name right that
21:12 - it helps no talk to the sequel database
21:15 - right so you can see that we're this is
21:18 - just connecting to the database but down
21:21 - here we can actually use the sequel
21:25 - syntax which is kind of cool I mean I'm
21:29 - not that familiar with it but it is
21:31 - pretty cool that you can just you know
21:33 - send in you know a sequel query just
21:37 - like you would put it in normally and
21:39 - then we'll get you know we'll get the
21:42 - data back once we get the data back we
21:43 - loop through it
21:45 - right and then so in this for for posts
21:48 - of posts then we could do whatever we
21:52 - want to manipulate that data in here
21:54 - like we talked about yesterday
21:56 - and then now this part well this part is
22:01 - building the data that we're going to
22:03 - send to WordPress and then this is
22:07 - actually sending the data so we're
22:11 - authenticating and sending Harshit also
22:14 - added a counter
22:16 - that'll give us a console log for how
22:21 - many posts have been added so really
22:28 - nice and I wonder if we could have or
22:32 - when I ran this earlier I'm gonna give
22:35 - you an example of let's see before I
22:42 - guess I didn't get a count last time oh
22:53 - all right so that's what's going on
22:55 - let's try to pull in some data now so we
22:58 - need we're gonna pull this in as faculty
23:02 - and we're gonna try to give it a
23:04 - category of philosophy so let's see what
23:13 - we want do we need an ID I don't think
23:18 - we need the ID the language we need the
23:21 - title we need content HTML then we need
23:25 - the status Brian what's the status mean
23:37 - we talked about this yesterday right
23:40 - a is active
23:44 - but I thought we were it was going to be
23:47 - a and I like active inactive but we're
23:49 - getting in oh no we don't need this edit
23:56 - history I don't think I'm gonna mess
24:04 - with bring in they created it's okay so
24:11 - the the o means it's been submitted and
24:14 - it's waiting for approval alright
24:23 - Brian's gonna check on that yeah I don't
24:28 - see any it unless you all think of
24:30 - something I don't really see any reason
24:33 - to keep the created date or the names of
24:40 - the people that put this in now keep in
24:42 - mind we are going to have a copy of all
24:45 - this so if we really needed to look look
24:47 - at this we could go back through I think
24:51 - I'm going to export it in basically all
24:53 - three formats that we can export it and
24:55 - save it and that way we still have
24:57 - access to this data but just in terms of
24:59 - what we ought to bring into WordPress I
25:02 - don't think we need any of this
25:05 - let's see you let's say we don't need
25:07 - that we don't a user ID so we'll need
25:10 - folder ID we don't need a content teaser
25:17 - do we need published so the publish we
25:22 - just have zeros and ones does the zero
25:26 - mean it's not published yet let's go
25:29 - over and see me yeah you know what maybe
25:33 - the zero means it's not it's not
25:37 - published it'd be published at some
25:40 - point or has it been unpublished you
25:43 - know purposely
25:49 - and let's see the other fields here all
25:55 - right so we don't need any of that
25:58 - private I don't even see anything marked
26:01 - as private anyway all right I'm not
26:09 - gonna worry about template ID we have a
26:11 - ton of them are just no
26:20 - okay
26:25 - whoa what's going on here oh there we go
26:31 - it's just that was that was odd actually
26:43 - this is odd as well so these are all the
26:46 - same but then once we get down here the
26:49 - titles are odd and there's no content
26:58 - I'm gonna scroll over and see if there's
27:01 - any content anywhere maybe we can put in
27:03 - a check that says you know if there's no
27:07 - content this is where it kept the teaser
27:11 - field I think maybe we could say if
27:17 - there is no content we're not gonna pull
27:19 - it in either
27:30 - for your CV maybe are these just
27:33 - references to - maybe PDFs Brian wants
27:42 - to see that teaser section let's bring
27:44 - that up if I hover
27:51 - yeah it just a gives basic info phone
27:54 - number email address title yeah but it's
28:07 - only for the for those last two at the
28:09 - bottom and I think we have the more data
28:14 - up here
28:22 - all right well I say for now at least
28:25 - we'll say if there's nothing here for
28:30 - content HTML then we don't put it in
28:33 - WordPress let's see what's in it for row
28:43 - 36 is that's one small chunk of an
28:47 - overall piece of the smart form which
28:49 - creates the faculty page okay so Brown
28:54 - are you saying that the data that we're
28:56 - getting here is not it's not everything
28:59 - we need on the faculty page then tell me
29:03 - this is showing us you know name image a
29:07 - little email link to a CV a video and
29:14 - then there's details so there's some
29:17 - text so these ones up here seem more
29:21 - like a complete you know this is
29:27 - complete you know information on okay
29:30 - good
29:31 - that's everything all right then that
29:32 - seems like it's definitely doable
29:35 - ideally let me think if we could do this
29:39 - differently
29:43 - I'm much
29:48 - all right let me let me just show you
29:50 - what you what I'm thinking and you all
29:52 - let me know whether or not is reasonable
29:54 - so if I were making these post types
29:58 - from scratch in WordPress I wouldn't
30:00 - just have the the content in you know
30:05 - because this went up glowing which shows
30:07 - up in that big content editing area for
30:11 - a wordpress post i wouldn't put all this
30:14 - stuff in there with HTML right i would
30:16 - have different fields custom fields so
30:21 - there'd be a custom field for name title
30:23 - you know all that stuff the image
30:26 - wouldn't just be a link to an image that
30:29 - would be the featured image for that
30:30 - post type so it'd be a different spot
30:32 - where you put it in so if possible with
30:38 - the wordpress api would it be better if
30:42 - we could find a way to separate these
30:45 - out based on the names of the tags where
30:49 - this info is supposed to be and then add
30:52 - them as these these extra fields
31:02 - the only reason I mean I think that's it
31:05 - would be the best way but I'm wondering
31:09 - is that gonna make it just too much to
31:14 - transfer all this data over you know
31:16 - we'd have to go in some of them
31:19 - hopefully we'll have the same you know
31:22 - structure so I'm hoping all faculty have
31:24 - the same structure so we really only
31:26 - have to build it out once to be able to
31:27 - pull that data out and put it in I don't
31:34 - know a little old thing I'm gonna one
31:36 - does it even make sense what I'm saying
31:38 - is it clear
31:40 - number two assuming that it's clear what
31:44 - I'm talking about
31:45 - should we try to do it that way I'm
31:53 - swimming about the time here it's
31:54 - already December so really there's only
31:59 - like two weeks that I'm gonna be working
32:01 - on this in December and then we'll have
32:04 - the whole month of January and then at
32:09 - that point so we're really talking like
32:12 - six more weeks of working on this before
32:15 - we need to have something that's
32:17 - reasonably finished so that people can
32:20 - test
32:32 - you know what I think I I've talked
32:38 - myself into the answer here okay
32:44 - sorry if this is hard to follow I'm
32:46 - thinking out loud so that you all can
32:48 - understand what's going through my head
32:50 - here okay here's the plan
32:53 - we're gonna just pull the data in as
32:55 - these big chunks keep the HTML there
32:58 - we'll get all the data put in we can
33:00 - always go in after the fact and change
33:03 - it right so let's say we pull all the
33:05 - faculty in it wouldn't be ideal but we'd
33:09 - still up we'd have all the data in there
33:10 - and then we can just go in with some CSS
33:13 - later on you know grab these tags as is
33:16 - and then then you can style it however
33:22 - we want right at that point we'd have
33:27 - something that would look good and it
33:29 - would work to launch after that we could
33:32 - have let's say some student workers go
33:35 - in and we would make the real custom
33:39 - post type with the fields necessary or
33:42 - better yet we could just add the fields
33:45 - in to the custom post type that already
33:47 - has all the data have student workers go
33:49 - in separate out that data and then once
33:53 - we have that all separated out we can
33:55 - just go in chunks and go back and change
33:58 - or we could change our components or
34:03 - react components to pick out that data
34:06 - separately did you know what that makes
34:11 - sense so essentially we're doing a good
34:14 - enough solution for launch since it's so
34:16 - quick but we're still leaving it open so
34:20 - that it's entirely possible albeit
34:23 - somewhat time consuming to grow it out
34:26 - and separate it by hand or even we
34:29 - wouldn't have separate by hand but or
34:31 - even try to build out a somewhat
34:33 - automated way of pulling that data in
34:37 - and then we can give it the attention it
34:40 - deserves in small chunks as the year
34:43 - goes on let me look back at the live
34:45 - shots you
34:46 - think about it okay Uncle Pat's is
34:50 - separating out the different data fields
34:52 - this better long-term answer from an
34:54 - architecture standpoint it may not be
34:55 - the quickest solution for your timeline
34:57 - that is also right in line with agile
34:59 - iterations okay cool
35:00 - all right thank you okay all right I
35:06 - think that's a good plan for now if we
35:08 - run into issues in the HTML that we're
35:10 - bringing in is just too crazy to work
35:12 - with we can always you know switch that
35:16 - up that's not you know that's something
35:18 - that'll be easily changeable as we're
35:22 - pulling that data in and we'll try to
35:24 - pull the data in per category so we'll
35:27 - make it smaller chunks that way we don't
35:28 - end up pulling in you know nine thousand
35:30 - rows of data and then realizing after
35:32 - that oh we messed it up all right we'll
35:35 - do it in small chunks check it out make
35:37 - sure it works all right and then we'll
35:39 - move on it'll be a little bit slower
35:40 - than just bringing it all in at once but
35:43 - it could prevent big mistakes okay so
35:50 - let's bring that in now so what we want
35:52 - to grab is how did that go I'm gonna
35:56 - have to keep checking my syntax here
35:58 - because I'm not okay I'm not great with
36:05 - sequel so we want
36:14 - I'm gonna bring in Content ID that way
36:18 - if we ever need to go back and reference
36:21 - the original content it'll be really
36:23 - easy for us to do that with the ID so we
36:26 - don't really need that and WordPress but
36:28 - it could be helpful
36:29 - oh it's an ID there we go
36:37 - are we separating by commas yeah
36:40 - it's a Content ID and we need content
36:46 - title content HTML it should be you know
37:02 - I thought I'd misspelled it since I
37:08 - wasn't getting the autocomplete but
37:10 - looks alright now the content HTML I
37:13 - think there is only one other thing
37:27 - did we want to bring this in or I'm
37:35 - sorry the folder ID I don't think we
37:40 - need to bring the folder ID in right if
37:43 - we're gonna pull these in small chunks
37:47 - then that shouldn't be an issue so this
37:49 - is all that we'll need to bring in we
37:54 - are and then we're gonna pull it in by
37:56 - folder ID so we'll only get these is
37:59 - there a way put a tick between the
38:03 - column names on select it looks a lot
38:05 - cleaner
38:17 - okay her should sing use limit keyword
38:21 - okay limit 500 okay I don't I shouldn't
38:27 - need to use it for this one because
38:28 - there's definitely not we have 36 rows
38:30 - that match this but we should we
38:32 - probably should use it for some of our
38:38 - bigger chunks trying to catch up here on
38:42 - a live chat these between concentrating
38:50 - okay so drum long the saying put put
38:58 - back ticks between these is that how we
39:04 - did it I'm gonna even write that for now
39:07 - like it is for now you write a live look
39:09 - cleaner but just for for time purposes
39:13 - I'm gonna leave it like this oh I know
39:19 - what I wanted to ask is there a way that
39:21 - I could put let's say a keyword like not
39:26 - not and it would be HTML content and
39:35 - then like blank would that work
39:38 - I may as well try it oops consonants
39:44 - HTML equals nothing let's try it now
39:52 - syntax a keyword in odds
40:04 - all right so I guess I don't know how to
40:05 - use not if exists
40:10 - all right great thank you hush it so if
40:15 - Diggs is 22 it's not showing up or and
40:25 - okay I could use end can I use content
40:35 - HTML can I do is not equal to is that a
40:40 - thing in in sequel I'll try it
40:50 - nope incompatible and not equal to
40:57 - operator where column name is not null
41:04 - okay thank you
41:07 - Erland I appreciate that is no
41:14 - [Music]
41:21 - or just not know is that how it is
41:29 - interact syntax
41:43 - I just put is no I need to remove the
41:49 - site content HTML if not select a show
42:22 - all right all right well I got rid of
42:25 - the red line so this is a promising
42:28 - awesome thank you who's that Erland well
42:33 - several of you were trying to tell me
42:35 - what to do here
42:37 - Berlin ended up having the the syntax
42:42 - that I ended up using all right so let's
42:44 - double check and that did not work what
42:48 - did I mess up so we still got these
43:03 - we can always just pull this in and I
43:06 - mean I I know how to check for this in
43:08 - JavaScript but I think it would be
43:11 - better to to not pull them in at all if
43:14 - we know for sure we're not going to need
43:16 - them
43:30 - see
43:37 - it is it's uh
43:47 - our [ __ ] was the last thing that you're
43:50 - you're trying to say there it is not
43:53 - null with she's trying to say the syntax
44:00 - is supposed to be just not null are you
44:02 - saying the syntax is not supposed to be
44:05 - null
44:05 - I'm not I'm not sure I can try like this
44:13 - nope okay
44:24 - it's so not content all right let's try
44:31 - this all right let's do oh well I've
44:41 - been going for quite a long time and I
44:43 - haven't stopped I noticed there were
44:44 - some questions I haven't stopped to
44:46 - answer any questions let me let me take
44:50 - just a 5-minute break here and answer
44:53 - some questions because normally I don't
44:55 - go this long without answering anything
44:59 - so let me try let me answer some
45:00 - questions here well it looks like
45:03 - heart's just trying to find the correct
45:05 - syntax for me I know I saw a question
45:11 - okay so our Pez says how do you motivate
45:14 - motivate yourself to code daily I failed
45:17 - every day I don't know why help me
45:18 - okay arpeggio you're still there because
45:21 - you did ask that you know a few minutes
45:23 - ago so I mean my motivation to code well
45:30 - number one is I get paid to code and if
45:33 - I didn't come in and code I wouldn't
45:34 - have a job so that's a great motivation
45:39 - when I was let's say freelance right the
45:44 - motivation still somewhat had to do with
45:47 - money but to be honest with you I enjoy
45:49 - coding so I enjoy building stuff and I
45:52 - enjoy getting better so I'd say it's a
45:54 - combination and you know leave aside the
45:56 - whole I have to make money to pay bills
45:58 - and take care of my family which I mean
46:01 - that's significant motivator but leaving
46:03 - that aside I would say it's a mixture of
46:07 - I don't know competitiveness wanting to
46:12 - be better at what I do
46:14 - you know personal pride in that and
46:16 - trying to do good things in just fun in
46:19 - enjoyment so yes so there's some times
46:22 - when I just I have fun coding so I want
46:25 - to code because I like building things
46:27 - and there's some times when I force
46:29 - myself to code because or to learn
46:31 - something new and try it out because I
46:33 - want to be good
46:37 - so I'd say that's you know those are the
46:40 - motivating factors for me now on like a
46:44 - really short term scale you can help
46:47 - yourself you know to get motivated there
46:49 - have been times when you know you know I
46:51 - always break up my work with Pomodoro
46:53 - sessions I think that helps with
46:54 - motivations because you have all these
46:55 - really small chunks that don't seem
46:57 - intimidating and then when you finish
46:59 - one it feels like a victory even if it
47:01 - was something small you can actually
47:03 - move it you know to a different column
47:05 - in my case I usually use a Trello board
47:08 - but I've done it before where you know
47:11 - I'll have let's say like a piece of
47:14 - candy or a chocolate bar something you
47:17 - know sitting on my desk and also okay if
47:19 - I get through this Pomodoro session or
47:22 - if I get through this task then I'm
47:24 - going to eat that candy bar right it's
47:26 - kind of silly but if you need a little
47:30 - bit of motivation there it is or I'll
47:32 - say you know after I finish this task
47:34 - then I'm gonna go I'm gonna then all eat
47:37 - lunch or then I'll do something that can
47:40 - be just a like a short-term motivator
47:42 - just to get you through you know
47:44 - something really tough so that would
47:49 - kind of be my my advice if you have a
47:51 - really hard time getting yourself
47:53 - motivated you could look into some other
47:55 - things like you know are you getting
47:57 - enough exercise are you eating right did
47:59 - you get enough sleep if you're doing all
48:02 - those things and it's still there
48:04 - you might want to think about talking to
48:06 - your doctor seeing do you have any
48:08 - health issues there's all kind of stuff
48:11 - that could cause that you know maybe
48:12 - some mild depression thyroid problems I
48:17 - mean there's so many things but first I
48:19 - try you know try to get yourself
48:22 - motivated with some of the things I
48:23 - mentioned first and and then you know
48:26 - try with exercise and diet I'm not a
48:28 - doctor at all so you know don't take my
48:30 - advice is if I was but just for me I've
48:32 - you know that also seems to help
48:35 - so hopefully that some of that was at
48:37 - least useful to you or someone else and
48:41 - then ultimately if you try everything
48:43 - and you're still not motivated it could
48:44 - may be coding is not your thing you know
48:47 - maybe you should try to find something
48:48 - that does excite you
48:50 - to work or maybe just a different area
48:52 - of coding you know think there's so many
48:55 - different things you could go into you
48:58 - in the area of like coding programming
49:00 - you know engineering you know just maybe
49:03 - try out some new things do you find
49:04 - something that you really do get excited
49:07 - about one more question here in our last
49:09 - minute of our break and then we'll go
49:11 - back and get this data transferred over
49:15 - Oh more says hi hey Jesse I've been
49:19 - following you for a while I've noticed
49:21 - that you work on several types of
49:22 - projects run in back and mobile I was
49:24 - wondering what is your role in this
49:25 - company my official title is front-end
49:28 - developer but realistically I'm I'm like
49:32 - the project manager as well for all
49:34 - these projects so my I have full freedom
49:40 - to use whatever tools that I need
49:44 - whatever technologies that I think is
49:46 - best as long as the projects get done so
49:51 - if I meet the project requirements on
49:53 - time no one worries about what I'm using
49:57 - also I mean cost is if I came in and
50:00 - said I want to use this certain type of
50:01 - technology it's gonna cost us $100,000
50:03 - then they care but I usually use
50:06 - open-source you know that doesn't cost
50:08 - anything so now I mean if you are using
50:13 - open-source a lot and relying on it you
50:16 - should really consider giving back and
50:19 - certainly I'm open to that if assuming
50:23 - that my code is up to quality to be able
50:25 - to be merged then I'll definitely do
50:28 - that but you know even if I can't do
50:30 - that I for sure at least try to give
50:32 - credit to those technologies that I use
50:35 - on you know posting about it on Twitter
50:37 - featuring it talking about it on the
50:39 - stream so I don't want to give people
50:42 - the impression that open-source means
50:44 - free with no responsibility right if we
50:47 - want those open-source products to keep
50:48 - going and getting better you know we
50:50 - ought to contribute something you know
50:53 - donate you know financially or with your
50:56 - time and your abilities so anyway
51:02 - so my role is a little bit more than my
51:05 - title you know would would have you
51:08 - believe but basically I I do whatever
51:12 - needs done to get the project done if
51:14 - that means working with databases you
51:17 - know that's it if I need to set up
51:18 - servers if I need to develop stuff
51:20 - backend stuff you know I do that but at
51:24 - least usually what I do is front-end it
51:29 - would be considered front-end although
51:31 - lately I've been into all different
51:33 - kinds of things so that's a good
51:36 - question of all right so let's go back
51:41 - I guess I'll set the Pomodoro clock
51:45 - haven't really been using it that yet
51:48 - this dream but it'll be a reminder I
51:50 - guess so let me check the live chat see
51:54 - what we have in terms of syntax to try
51:56 - to get this where we want okay
52:17 - okay so we just need
52:24 - oops
52:31 - we're not content HTML
52:44 - okay let's run it whoops oh I think I
52:48 - forgot I feed that so not gonna work
52:59 - still need and
53:11 - hi that's is that exactly no I think
53:16 - it's something okay
53:27 - all right now I'm getting a lot in the
53:30 - chat here uh okay it's wrong were not
53:39 - showing the prices and before
53:46 - it's two single quotes okay all right
53:55 - parentheses Michael saying parentheses
53:59 - around the criteria all right Michael
54:03 - where am I gonna put these parentheses I
54:04 - mean I'm I'm sorry I betrayed me like
54:07 - I'm someone who knows nothing about
54:10 - about sequel queries because that's not
54:12 - really that far from the truth okay so
54:22 - in the where you put parentheses around
54:26 - that okay and then put this
54:41 - - think so Michaels saying think of your
54:45 - whereas an if statement in JavaScript
54:47 - with multiple criteria how do you keep
54:49 - them together okay all right that makes
54:52 - so much sense what about what's going on
54:54 - over here why am I getting a line okay
54:59 - no all right all right it's not working
55:08 - what am I doing here knots
55:41 - okay use all right harsh it's in use
55:45 - double quotes
56:12 - Mike what is the data type of the ID
56:15 - column the folder ID probably I don't
56:30 - know maybe it's not a string it worked
56:32 - before let me just remove this quickly
56:36 - to check so oops I didn't put it in to
56:50 - be honest I don't know what the data
56:51 - type is or how to find that I mean it it
56:57 - obviously looks like it's a number but
57:01 - there's not closer on anything so you
57:04 - know I know this is a string so I'm not
57:09 - sure but it is working like like this
57:44 - okay news how saying does not matter
57:47 - what data type it is okay we'll just pop
57:50 - this back in and let's I don't wanna
57:54 - keep working with it
57:59 - concentration oh yeah it's not still
58:05 - give the red stuff invalid column name
58:10 - contents
58:16 - text
58:26 - okay I know
58:36 - and Connie it's not no okay all right
58:53 - hmm
59:01 - okay let's try okay
59:10 - so there may be Erland says there may be
59:13 - some space in there which is detected as
59:15 - content so let's try hard s another idea
59:18 - remove not before consummation okay oops
59:29 - hmm
59:31 - yeah this is still detecting something
59:33 - in here all right usually comes in these
59:43 - miracles all right let's try let's try
59:49 - this this is from Harshit he's saying we
59:52 - could do not so we're gonna do at the
60:00 - end for length equals zero shadows nope
60:09 - I got it says invalid let's make sure I
60:17 - got that right I mean content you know
60:43 - rooks asking if spaces increase length
60:54 - I don't know
61:15 - it's like lengths
61:33 - I
61:42 - greater than one all right let's see if
61:45 - getting some more stuff here okay so we
61:52 - have something else here all right let's
61:56 - try this
62:03 - and I'm gonna paste this in because it
62:05 - was a lot okay so now we're saying I
62:08 - gots to get some weird character there
62:14 - all right so coalesce character length
62:18 - content HTML all right let's see what
62:23 - this does the character character length
62:26 - is not recognized built-in function name
62:44 - all right let me check out that I didn't
62:47 - miss anything I think I've tried
62:48 - everything that's been suggested so far
62:52 - let me know if I haven't all right let's
62:55 - see a Mayan continuity as lengthier
63:00 - selects
63:14 - at length continuity okay
63:50 - all right select content a day like I
63:53 - was lying throughout another call and be
63:56 - a query okay let's see
64:18 - that's not gonna work from now this
64:37 - okay
64:45 - hmm all right let me let me read what
64:49 - else is in here now Javier says Chavez
64:59 - content HTML less than symbol greater
65:02 - than symbol type the actual symbols
65:06 - without spaces I think that's the way
65:08 - you say not equal for Strings you can't
65:13 - type this symbols in chat interesting
65:23 - all right let me try I'm gonna try a
65:25 - hardship put some in I can just copy and
65:27 - paste I'll try that first because
65:29 - obviously it's easy to copy and paste
65:36 - oops
65:43 - nope
65:50 - it's not
66:05 - so and Vincents and and content asean is
66:13 - not no I think we did that one already
66:17 - yeah we tried that so Vincent we tried
66:20 - that one already and for some reason
66:23 - it's it's not recognizing those as as
66:27 - not enough alright Michael I get the the
66:36 - length column ID thing which it did it
66:41 - worked but why why do we want the length
66:43 - of the column ID wouldn't wouldn't be
66:46 - better to get the length of the HD
66:51 - content HTML yes what I was thinking all
66:57 - right
67:02 - actually this will be useful just to see
67:04 - what this returns
67:17 - invalid argument for one of my function
67:38 - yeah this is not working maybe because
67:40 - it's a string and the Content ID was an
67:48 - integer yeah it's an integer just text
67:57 - okay Michael I you keep typing in length
68:03 - but it won't let me it won't let me use
68:05 - length they keep saying use Len
68:21 - no Anna
68:52 - alright let's let me think about this
69:02 - man I wish I had my interns there's a
69:06 - possibility I might get three interns
69:07 - and two of the three are supposed to be
69:09 - good with databases and they probably
69:12 - would remember a lot of this syntax all
69:18 - right let's
69:26 - how about I don't worry about this now
69:32 - all right late the the whipping post and
69:35 - content show less than equal in all
69:39 - right we'll try it we'll try one more
69:43 - and
69:56 - C Mon us and what is it less than equal
70:07 - and less than equal to is that what
70:23 - you mean less than greater than
70:39 - hmm
70:44 - okay I think our problem is that we
70:48 - can't use this kind of stuff on that
70:50 - data type so we need to use things that
70:57 - work on it's calling it @n text which
71:00 - I'm assuming is the sequel equivalent of
71:03 - string all right let's see all right so
71:10 - Umberto has pasted something in there so
71:19 - let's try that
71:26 - whoa all right
71:54 - yeah I was is wrong with this it's not
71:57 - working
72:02 - all right I'm not sure what's wrong with
72:04 - that I'm Berto but I mean it's giving me
72:07 - it's giving me an error all right let's
72:16 - try this day length all right Vincent is
72:22 - saying since its text we have to use
72:25 - data length so let's try that day length
72:32 - is greater than zero
72:43 - okay we didn't get an error but we also
72:46 - didn't have anything return
73:01 - see alright so hard [ __ ] has put in a
73:05 - Stack Overflow link let's check that out
73:27 - all right I guess we could try this it's
73:33 - sorry everybody
73:34 - I've messed up my my sign I didn't see
73:41 - you all type in that either cuz I was
73:43 - looking at that Stack Overflow yes yes
73:47 - all right okay excellent who was that
73:53 - Vincent Vincent all right great job that
73:57 - was though that did it
73:59 - thank you very much let's import this
74:04 - data all right yeah let's bring that in
74:16 - actually let's just bring this in
74:27 - all right so for this here we go and
74:37 - content titles that was publish I wonder
74:43 - if we could give it an ID just shut up
74:48 - [Music]
74:56 - oops post I still have the API Doc's up
75:07 - here I guess I could see those I want to
75:15 - get posting when I post
75:28 - hmm I guess I can't set the ad did
75:50 - all right we'll leave it off for now
75:57 - yeah I'm not really seeing
76:08 - in a category
76:15 - let's just just try to pull this in and
76:20 - see how that's works especially with a
76:22 - category so let's add a category in
76:26 - right now we want it to be faculty yeah
76:40 - okay we'll save that and let's run it
76:46 - no no no I agree
77:08 - the hardship is asking how will you
77:10 - insert folder ID and WordPress how hurts
77:17 - it does not like a sequel server
77:21 - yeah I'm not using it by choice this is
77:26 - just what we have the data on right now
77:28 - so the last time I ran this it didn't
77:32 - actually give me any indication that
77:34 - this worked so let's just check out what
77:41 - we have here in our or posts see if we
77:46 - got it hmm we refresh okay
77:53 - still nothing
78:04 - all right so that didn't work
78:19 - that's interesting so we haven't gotten
78:22 - an error but I'm not seeing the data
78:39 - use
78:45 - all right so let's see
78:51 - nothing good somewhere else go back no
78:56 - you know what I wonder if what's this I
79:06 - think probably what I need is the slug
79:09 - for this and knots I'm maybe it wasn't
79:17 - adding it because it wasn't that
79:19 - category so I'm gonna save this and try
79:21 - it again
79:36 - mmm-hmm nope I wasn't it
79:39 - hard saying console of the data okay
79:42 - let's do that
79:44 - [Music]
79:51 - alright let's go
80:11 - Arsen change the log frequency okay yeah
80:17 - let's just take this up and then just
80:21 - console look
80:36 - okay it's saying that it's inserted but
80:41 - we're seeing it is not inserted let's
80:52 - see what did we add up here let's take
81:01 - this out oh you know what it wasn't that
81:09 - it was because I tried to add this ID in
81:12 - and you can't add an ID and I forgot to
81:16 - take it out so remember we checked the
81:19 - docs realize the Canadian they never
81:21 - never anything about it so that's most
81:24 - likely why try it now there we go
81:33 - that's why interesting the category
81:36 - thing did not work though so we had
81:38 - category faculty let me check the docs
81:43 - and see category oh okay because I
81:50 - messed it up it's supposed to be
81:51 - categories
81:59 - and it's supposed to be an array all
82:02 - right
82:03 - oh well that was kind of a test anyway
82:08 - so ones have to remember that for next
82:10 - time
82:10 - kids categories and needs to be an array
82:13 - I would like to see what it's what the
82:15 - update process is for updating a post
82:22 - okay that's not that's not as good here
82:28 - so when you go to update you actually
82:32 - have to put in the post ID I was hoping
82:38 - that you could just do a post request
82:45 - now that the yeah this makes more sense
82:48 - you have the ID all right good to know I
82:55 - mean I wasn't gonna update right now but
82:56 - it's good to know that if we ever need
83:02 - to that's how we got to do it okay so
83:04 - like I said this is a test so I don't
83:06 - want to leave these in posts but I did
83:08 - want to see ok can we add multiple
83:11 - things and we'll come in and let's check
83:13 - all right cool we have this in here it
83:16 - looks weird now but we can check the
83:18 - HTML and it looks a little bit nicer now
83:21 - when it actually is pulled in HTML
83:24 - that's interesting that's X that's
83:31 - really interesting
83:34 - it did not pull in all the tags or maybe
83:38 - WordPress stripped a lot of them out so
83:43 - if you remember what we should have
83:45 - oops
83:52 - is something more like this
84:01 - alright let's set this with WordPress
84:03 - for a second
84:18 - it strips them automatically I don't
84:20 - know if you saw it was really small but
84:22 - I tried to put a non-standard
84:24 - HTML tag in here and it stripped it out
84:28 - I'm really glad we tested this so I'm
84:33 - gonna have to look up how to turn that
84:36 - functionality off for our editor at
84:41 - least for when we're pulling stuff in
84:42 - that might not be a bad idea to turn it
84:45 - off later on to keep people from putting
84:49 - invalid HTML in here but for now I'd
84:55 - rather keep that structure okay all
85:04 - right so we got a lot of done today I'm
85:07 - pretty amazed that in two days we pretty
85:10 - much figured out how we're gonna do this
85:11 - migration I haven't done it but having
85:15 - migrated everything but we've tested it
85:17 - enough that we know it's gonna work
85:20 - still have a few things to work out like
85:22 - getting it to keep the tags that we send
85:26 - it but other than that not bad is
85:31 - definitely a successful stream today so
85:35 - let me check the live chat quickly to
85:38 - see if there are any questions that I
85:39 - missed I think I was able to catch
85:41 - everything as we were going along and
85:45 - then I think we'll wrap things up
86:09 - okay Harshit saying let's change the
86:12 - tags using regular expression yeah we
86:19 - could do that I'm just I'm worried that
86:22 - you know would it be too much so harsh
86:25 - is saying like try to replace the
86:29 - content with replace name with div well
86:33 - that's good but I wouldn't want to
86:34 - replace it with div it would have to be
86:36 - like div and then class name right
86:42 - because I want to I want to be able to
86:44 - still grab those so would it be worth it
86:47 - knowing that we would have to go through
86:50 - and figure out you know for the faculty
86:54 - it's fine because they're all going to
86:55 - be pretty standard I hope but then for
86:58 - each different post type we'll have to
86:59 - figure out what we want to change the
87:01 - stuff to maybe it would be easier just
87:09 - to figure out how to turn off all right
87:12 - well here's it I'm gonna try to figure
87:14 - out how to make WordPress accept the
87:17 - tags that we send it if that's not
87:19 - possible or if it's really hard to do
87:21 - then we'll try to just change the the
87:24 - tags because the tags at the very least
87:28 - I mean there it makes it obvious what
87:33 - the thing is so I don't dislike that
87:36 - those tags and as far as I know html5
87:40 - it's it's totally definitely okay maro
87:46 - is a feast day catholic holy day of
87:54 - obligation so I'm off tomorrow since I
87:59 - work at Catholic University so I will
88:04 - see you all on Monday and I'll try to
88:10 - work on figuring out what's what's going
88:12 - on with WordPress and we may or may not
88:17 - do more streams on the transferring this
88:19 - data because we pretty much figured
88:23 - how it's gonna work it'll probably be
88:27 - just somewhat time consuming so I'll
88:31 - work on it or I'll find you know someone
88:33 - else to work on it yeah all right so
88:41 - anyway to anybody who's anybody who's
88:44 - Catholic have a happy Feast of the
88:46 - Immaculate Conception tomorrow it's cool
88:50 - if you don't have to work that's awesome
88:52 - if you do have to work that's kind of
88:55 - usual nobody really gets off for that
88:57 - but make it to Mass if you can and I
89:03 - think that's it thank you so much
89:05 - everyone for helping it's really obvious
89:07 - that I needed the help and I very much
89:09 - appreciate it so have a have a great
89:13 - weekend since I won't see y'all tomorrow
89:15 - and I'll be back on Monday
