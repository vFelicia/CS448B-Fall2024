00:04 - hey everybody it's
00:06 - Jesse uh sorry I did not get the Tweet
00:10 - out about this video until uh 3 minutes
00:13 - ago so I don't know if how many people
00:17 - rely on Twitter uh to know when I'm
00:19 - going to go live so maybe it'll be a
00:22 - little bit slower here at the beginning
00:24 - in terms of viewers uh also I didn't
00:27 - even get the uh event scheduled until
00:29 - maybe about an hour ago so uh today's
00:32 - just been I got in late
00:35 - and I
00:37 - had all kind of stuff going on I
00:40 - actually just interviewed a student uh
00:43 - who's interested in
00:45 - working uh with my
00:48 - department uh so that would be awesome
00:50 - if it works out I know uh he has another
00:53 - interview uh with a company near here as
00:56 - well so I wish him luck with that but uh
01:00 - hopefully he decides to work with
01:04 - us so yeah I'm just going to wait I'm
01:07 - not going to get started for maybe a
01:08 - couple minutes we'll just talk for a
01:10 - little bit uh just to wait for some
01:11 - people to come in
01:13 - because I um I alerted this so late
01:17 - there we go okay now now we're at a
01:19 - normal it was showing seven viewers for
01:21 - a while and now it just jumped to 54 so
01:24 - that's closer to our normal amount of
01:28 - viewers um
01:32 - all right uh we got some yeah we got
01:36 - some people looks like some new new
01:39 - faces new names in the live chat um that
01:43 - I haven't I don't remember seeing before
01:45 - so hey
01:46 - everybody oh we got hello from the
01:48 - Ukraine
01:50 - awesome and let's see La tell me if I
01:54 - pronounce this wrong is it Laquita or
01:58 - Lita uh let let me know how if I
02:00 - pronounce that right
02:02 - um uh
02:04 - but on time for a live chat so
02:13 - awesome and um Yousef asked will you do
02:17 - a to-do app with react from scratch okay
02:20 - now we're picking up we're up over 70
02:22 - viewers now so let's um let's get
02:25 - started all right everybody shouting out
02:27 - where they're from we got India
02:28 - Barcelona UK
02:31 - awesome thanks for
02:34 - watching from from
02:37 - Chile from Rome awesome wow we got we
02:41 - got people from all over so and it looks
02:43 - like yeah it looks like we're getting
02:45 - some retweets here so that's picking up
02:48 - picking up fast from Los Angeles
02:54 - Romania uh all right so
02:57 - today I'm really excited about this talk
02:59 - topic and uh this was totally um I
03:02 - hadn't planned on doing this today but I
03:04 - got a pull
03:06 - request um
03:09 - from uh well I actually got two pool
03:12 - requests so let me let me bring these
03:14 - over just to show you because I want to
03:15 - give give credit where it is due so
03:19 - between yesterday's show and Today's
03:21 - Show I got two pool requests this one is
03:24 - from Danny and um you can check that I'm
03:27 - not going to go through all these on the
03:29 - air because you can see in the link in
03:31 - the show description uh you can check
03:34 - these out but had some cool stuff here
03:36 - um kind of preparing for even more so
03:39 - I'm I'm expecting I guess another
03:41 - another Pool request here um but did
03:44 - some kind of some optimization things so
03:48 - not no changes that would really be
03:50 - visible like uh to the user uh but
03:53 - definitely going to make things more
03:55 - readable easier to maintain um in terms
03:58 - of the code the other other pool request
04:01 - uh this is what we're going to be
04:02 - talking about today uh so vet this is
04:05 - his second pool request uh he had a
04:07 - great one um I think it was a few days
04:10 - ago or maybe uh yeah I think it was
04:12 - Friday uh that we talked about yesterday
04:14 - but this one uh so if you were here
04:17 - yesterday for the live chat uh there was
04:20 - some talk about
04:21 - using uh some linters and things to try
04:24 - to get more of a standard um uh style to
04:28 - the coding so uh I I haven't I've been a
04:32 - little bit sloppy in coding this and in
04:36 - general I've been sloppy for for two
04:37 - reasons one the timeline for this was
04:39 - really tight so I just kind of cut
04:42 - Corners uh in in terms of formatting
04:45 - everything
04:46 - properly uh to to get it launched also
04:50 - it's it's always been just me working on
04:52 - projects and that's allowed me to get a
04:53 - little bit lazy because nobody's ever
04:55 - around to call me out on it and um I'm
04:58 - not saying that that's a a good thing
04:59 - that's definitely not a good thing but
05:01 - that's just how it happened uh but now
05:04 - it makes a lot more sense for me to have
05:07 - kind of a standard format for my code
05:11 - because all of you are looking at the
05:13 - code and you're you're helping me we're
05:14 - collaborating on this so great
05:17 - idea so we're going to use I don't know
05:20 - if you can hear that but my stomach is
05:21 - growling so if you hear that I'm sorry
05:24 - sorry but I just um I forgot to eat
05:26 - today so uh I don't know if that happens
05:29 - to you but sometimes you just get you
05:31 - get working and you know before you know
05:33 - it uh you haven't eaten so I have to
05:36 - make sure I eat after this stream um so
05:40 - we're going to use a couple of things
05:42 - and uh you've probably been seeing some
05:43 - of these things uh I know at least I've
05:45 - been seeing them on Twitter a lot
05:47 - mentioned uh prettier and standard
05:51 - JS I'm going to kind of take you through
05:55 - um what I did I I know it looks like I
05:57 - haven't merged these yet but I I did
05:58 - merge them I just haven't pushed it uh
06:01 - back up to uh to
06:02 - GitHub but let me bring over two things
06:06 - I'm going to bring over my command line
06:09 - and I'm also going to bring over or I'm
06:10 - going to show you the code I've Linked
06:13 - In the show notes to standard JS their
06:17 - website and to the website for prettier
06:19 - so you can check that out you know kind
06:21 - of as we're going if you want to learn
06:22 - more about it and first of all let me
06:26 - show
06:28 - you I I do I want to show you the amount
06:30 - of errors that I had once I finally ran
06:33 - this uh so let me go back up so this is
06:37 - kind
06:38 - of I like slowly just narrow down the
06:41 - errors I think this is the first set
06:44 - so at first I had all these errors of
06:48 - just things a lot of them was components
06:51 - that I had imported or into another
06:53 - component and then I never used it so I
06:56 - had I guess at some point thought I was
06:58 - going to use use it and then never
07:00 - removed it I was really surprised at how
07:02 - many of those there were because I I
07:05 - thought that I was usually uh pretty
07:07 - careful about that but evidently I was
07:09 - not uh so those are a bunch of bunch of
07:11 - stuff there also if you remember from
07:14 - our episode whenever we uh we were
07:16 - making jQuery work with react and we had
07:20 - a bunch of
07:22 - functions in a separate file in our in
07:25 - our um what what file was it our app.js
07:28 - file yeah so we had in a separate file
07:32 - we had these functions that were using
07:33 - jQuery but then we were calling them in
07:35 - component did Mount
07:38 - so to um when we're using standard JS
07:42 - which uses uh es lent kind of behind the
07:44 - scenes it was looking at that component
07:47 - and saying you're trying to call this
07:48 - function and it's not defined it really
07:51 - it was defined in our other um our other
07:54 - document and then not only that but it
07:55 - was looking at that document where we
07:58 - actually had to find those functions and
08:00 - saying hey you define this and you never
08:01 - used it so so most of the errors I had
08:05 - were because of that okay so not really
08:07 - a big deal so I'll show you how I fix
08:09 - those errors because I'm I'm guessing
08:11 - that maybe if you're going to try to use
08:13 - this for the first time you might run
08:14 - into some of these errors as well I mean
08:17 - maybe hopefully you're not as as bad as
08:19 - I was with uh with my code and you don't
08:22 - get as many errors but I'll show you how
08:24 - to go over those uh how to fix those
08:26 - errors I'm going to show you my package
08:28 - Json first first so that if you if you
08:31 - want to try this out but you don't
08:32 - really want to like pull down my code uh
08:35 - you can just kind of piece it together
08:36 - so let's move this off before I show you
08:39 - how I I did those and we'll go to my
08:41 - package Json let me know if this is this
08:44 - is too small I'll just I could probably
08:47 - let me make it a little bit bigger right
08:48 - now I don't want to make it too big
08:50 - because I want you to be able to see
08:51 - kind of like the big picture here um of
08:54 - what we what we have now that we didn't
08:57 - have before and I have have some things
08:59 - up here that are new too but they don't
09:01 - really apply to what we're talking about
09:03 - today so basically we have this whole
09:04 - section now that's Dev
09:07 - dependencies
09:08 - and this this is what has been brought
09:12 - in okay and remember this is all from
09:14 - ven's uh pool request almost none of
09:16 - this is stuff that I did the only thing
09:18 - in here that I did on my own was I I
09:20 - imported this uh Babel es lint um
09:24 - package uh and I'll explain why I needed
09:26 - that in a minute um so basically
09:29 - these these four things got this
09:32 - working and then we have some new
09:34 - commands so we have this lint all right
09:37 - we have pre-commit and then we have lint
09:39 - lint staged all right so we have a lot
09:41 - of things going here where basically vet
09:43 - set this up uh which is very very nice
09:45 - of him he set all this up to look
09:48 - through all my folders where I had
09:50 - components and JavaScript
09:54 - files and to go through lint those and
09:58 - then automatically reformat them based
10:02 - on the standard JS um
10:05 - specifications okay so that's what the
10:08 - the linting all right is more like the
10:10 - standard JS the reformatting is from
10:12 - prettier okay and if you check out the
10:14 - docs for those uh you'll
10:19 - see so this is what's added also I I
10:25 - added this part down here and this was
10:27 - basically to deal with some of the
10:28 - errors so I'll talk about that in a
10:31 - second uh when I deal with those
10:36 - errors and that's it and as soon
10:39 - as I'm going to push this code I might
10:42 - as well do it right now let me push this
10:43 - to GitHub right now so you can follow
10:45 - along and everything is um is up to
10:58 - date
11:02 - on my other screen I'm just making this
11:05 - um I
11:06 - figure you um you all know how to run a
11:10 - commit uh but also you see this is new
11:13 - so this is um basically this is
11:16 - happening right when we run a commit
11:19 - before we were just doing a commit
11:21 - now all of this
11:26 - runs before the commit happens so really
11:28 - you can't you can't make a commit now
11:30 - without everything being put in uh a
11:33 - standard format which is awesome and
11:36 - that was that was from vet that's what
11:39 - um his additions here are
11:42 - doing all right
11:46 - so all this is now being pushed to the
11:50 - master branch and it's completed so if
11:52 - you go to the repo on the master Branch
11:54 - you can see all of this you can open up
11:56 - the uh package Json you can see
11:58 - everything I'm talking about and follow
11:59 - along uh so let me talk about some of
12:02 - these
12:04 - errors I'm not going to go over every
12:06 - single error just the ones that I think
12:07 - were kind of
12:09 - like it it was kind of tricky for me to
12:12 - figure out and uh kind of like to share
12:15 - how to get around those
12:18 - so um let's see we
12:24 - had these ones as I said are are really
12:27 - easy I just Define these components and
12:29 - hadn't used them okay so some of
12:32 - these like I said I had been defining
12:35 - these
12:37 - functions and not actually using them
12:41 - well I was defining them in the app.js
12:45 - file but not using them there and then I
12:47 - was using them in components but it was
12:48 - coming up as not defined so here's how I
12:50 - got around that so for some of them like
12:52 - for Fetch and for you know the dollar
12:56 - sign I just added them globally
12:59 - as uh since basically I use fetch in
13:02 - almost all the uh page level
13:05 - components so if you just add this you
13:08 - know this this whole section here okay
13:12 - including the ending things that fix
13:14 - that so basically that just lets es lint
13:18 - know that it's okay uh you can use these
13:22 - they're defined somewhere and it's all
13:24 - right to you so that fixed those errors
13:26 - but then you don't want to do this for
13:28 - for everything let's say you only use
13:30 - something once you don't want to make it
13:31 - a global so at the page
13:34 - level I did something like this so I use
13:37 - in component did Mount I use init tabs
13:40 - okay this is like I said this is defined
13:42 - over here in
13:43 - appjs so what I did here is I just added
13:47 - at the top in the comment Global and
13:50 - then the name of this function okay and
13:54 - that got rid of that error and I did a
13:56 - similar thing in every component I just
13:58 - put the name of the function so that got
13:59 - rid of those errors you know no big deal
14:02 - in reality at some point if I have more
14:05 - time now I know I've I've discussed this
14:07 - already with with all of you that this
14:10 - project needs to wind up so there's some
14:12 - things that I know should be done that
14:14 - may not get done because um they're not
14:17 - essential to the project functioning and
14:19 - I need to move on because I have a lot
14:21 - of other projects that are lining up
14:23 - that I need to uh to start working on
14:26 - so um we'll see maybe if I get some of
14:29 - these student workers that might be a
14:31 - good thing a good project for them to
14:33 - come in and and do some of this but I
14:35 - figure you know there's definitely a
14:37 - better way to do this than to have all
14:39 - this going in a a you know separate file
14:41 - so
14:43 - um that may happen at some
14:47 - point now the next the next error that I
14:50 - do want to talk about that was the
14:54 - trickiest was this
14:57 - one
15:00 - so in resources. JS which is the file
15:03 - we're in now it said there's a parsing
15:05 - error unexpected token equals on line in
15:10 - this case it was line 11 which this is
15:12 - probably different now since I had
15:14 - changed it so the line it is now is at
15:16 - 12 so it was basically throwing an error
15:18 - because we did
15:21 - this so the way that I found uh to get
15:24 - around this is um basically it wasn't it
15:29 - wasn't recognizing that like we're using
15:31 - this class here okay so it had something
15:33 - to do with that all right I'm not
15:35 - claiming that I know technically
15:37 - everything that was going on but
15:38 - basically the problem was that this is a
15:41 - newer syntax and it needed to recognize
15:44 - that as a newer syntax
15:47 - so that's why I
15:50 - installed this Babel es
15:53 - lent okay if you're not familiar with
15:55 - Babel that's a transpiler that lets you
15:57 - use the latest JavaScript syntax and it
16:00 - turns it into older syntax that older
16:03 - browsers can handle okay so I imported
16:07 - this so just yarn add Babel es lint and
16:10 - then I added the flag um hyphen capital
16:14 - D okay or you could do hyphen hyen Dev
16:18 - either way it'll put in your Dev
16:21 - dependencies that added it here and then
16:24 - down here you can add you can say what
16:26 - parser you want ES to use so I added
16:32 - this to the pars so I'm I'm saying es
16:35 - lent but just recognize that it's
16:38 - standard that's doing this but it's
16:40 - using ES lent kind of in the background
16:42 - okay so um we are talking about standard
16:45 - JS all right so that's it that's the
16:48 - only um the only things I really had to
16:50 - do I guess I'll show you the appjs just
16:52 - in case hopefully this won't be an issue
16:54 - with you because you won't have all
16:56 - these functions sitting in a separate
16:58 - fun file like this but all I did was all
17:02 - these functions are the one that I'm
17:03 - using in components and I'm not using on
17:05 - in this particular file so at the top I
17:07 - just did es lent
17:09 - disable and then at some point down here
17:12 - I reenable es
17:15 - lent so I enable it again here okay so
17:20 - the disadvantage is like everything in
17:22 - here is not getting linted properly
17:24 - although I did run lint before I did
17:26 - this so all the other errors that were
17:28 - in here here I
17:29 - fixed so these are all okay uh because I
17:33 - did it
17:34 - beforehand uh
17:37 - so I could you can actually like
17:41 - specifically uh put in like the the one
17:43 - rule that you want to rule out inside
17:46 - here but I couldn't find what it was I
17:48 - tried a couple of different ones and it
17:49 - wasn't working so just for the sake of
17:51 - getting this working before the video I
17:54 - um I just disabled everything within
17:56 - here okay
17:59 - so that's pretty much it that's all it
18:01 - took I mean on my end that's all it took
18:03 - to get this working vet I'm sure had had
18:05 - more work on his end and you can check
18:07 - out his his pool request to see all the
18:10 - work that he did and and everything that
18:12 - changed all the files that changed but
18:13 - at this
18:15 - point let me show you the results I know
18:18 - I've been ignoring the live chat uh for
18:20 - a few minutes I will get to you and I'll
18:22 - answer the questions just a minute but I
18:23 - I wanted to um I wanted to try getting
18:26 - to the point quickly and getting through
18:28 - it uh because
18:32 - usually um what happens
18:35 - is I get a bunch of viewers right off
18:38 - the bat and then we kind of like I kind
18:41 - of mess around a little bit and just
18:42 - kind of talk about some general things
18:44 - before we get started and I usually lose
18:46 - a bunch of people probably because this
18:49 - maybe is their first time viewing and
18:50 - they're thinking like what's this guy
18:52 - doing I thought he was going to talk
18:53 - about whatever I the title of the video
18:57 - is uh so that's why I'm ignoring the uh
19:00 - live chat right now but I'll get to it
19:02 - in a minute I just want to give you an
19:03 - example of how everything is um is now
19:07 - formatted kind of autof
19:10 - formatted and uh let's see let's try to
19:14 - do a side by
19:16 - side so I'm going to bring
19:19 - up this
19:23 - code and you can do you can open this up
19:25 - in GitHub as well on my other screen I'm
19:27 - just opening up this project in
19:30 - GitHub and I'm going to kind of go back
19:32 - in time to a previous commit before I
19:35 - did all
19:40 - this and we're just going to check out
19:43 - since I have the resources page up let's
19:45 - just check the resources
19:47 - page just to see what the difference
19:51 - is so I'm going to go I'm going to put
19:54 - these side by
19:57 - side make this a bit bigger for
20:02 - you and see I haven't I actually haven't
20:06 - compared this yet so hopefully it's the
20:08 - comparison is somewhat obvious so we
20:09 - might have to try another file but
20:13 - um you could see well aside from you
20:16 - know slight slight difference up
20:20 - here we have yeah so so I probably went
20:24 - back too far some of the stuff had been
20:25 - changed so let's get down more into the
20:30 - um into the body of
20:34 - this wonder if this is even going to be
20:36 - a good example no it's not because I
20:38 - went back too far sorry about that let
20:40 - me um go back
20:45 - to a commit that's
20:49 - maybe I want to go let me go somewhere
20:53 - that's maybe right there we go this this
20:57 - should be closer
21:00 - oops click the wrong
21:03 - thing here we
21:06 - go and sorry if you if you're not
21:09 - familiar with Git and GitHub and you're
21:11 - just you know kind of watching this
21:13 - you're probably somewhat confused about
21:16 - how that works so uh sorry about that if
21:18 - you watch some of the uh previous videos
21:21 - I
21:22 - explained uh
21:24 - how more about how how git Works uh
21:29 - um no my um uh my trackpad just ran out
21:34 - of batteries
21:36 - so this is terrible at least
21:40 - I now would be a great time for me to
21:42 - look back at the live
21:45 - chat and see if I can get I do have a
21:50 - mouse here I'm going to turn this mouse
21:53 - on so that I don't have to actually
21:55 - leave and go get batteries somewhere
21:59 - although I could change the batteries
22:00 - out from the mouse and put them in the
22:02 - trackpad but there we go it's just
22:04 - easier to use the mouse all right I
22:06 - haven't used Mouse in so long anybody I
22:09 - think if you use like a Macbook or an
22:11 - iMac with the trackpad you understand
22:14 - what I'm talking about once you get used
22:15 - to it it's just like Mouse using a mouse
22:18 - feels weird all right so I do have the
22:21 - mouse now um let's
22:24 - go I'm actually going to go to that app
22:28 - .js file because I think that has the
22:31 - most potential for improvement uh and
22:34 - probably the out of any of the the
22:36 - things that I've done
22:39 - so that might be the most drastic uh and
22:43 - obvious change
22:45 - so let me
22:52 - um make this a little bigger and so we
22:55 - can see so these are the same files
22:58 - before and after using uh using prettier
23:01 - so we did we did linting with uh
23:03 - standard JS and then prettier does like
23:06 - the auto
23:08 - reformatting uh
23:10 - so let's see so far not not not bad you
23:16 - so I did take this out because uh
23:18 - obviously like this is not really needed
23:20 - if we're doing going to do all our this
23:24 - lenting
23:26 - and
23:30 - I'm actually somewhat surprised at how
23:33 - well formatted this was okay big here's
23:36 - the big thing that that you can you
23:38 - probably already even caught this there
23:40 - are no semicolons at the end of the line
23:43 - here but there are here and we talked
23:45 - about this yesterday is
23:47 - that when when I was learning JavaScript
23:50 - it was always like you have to use a
23:52 - semicolon at the end of the line right I
23:54 - mean I think some of like the tutorials
23:56 - like the in browser tutorials if you
24:00 - don't put the semico and it doesn't work
24:02 - you know you have to go back and fix it
24:04 - so I'm trying to get away from that but
24:07 - obviously I'm I'm still doing it I
24:09 - probably don't even realize I'm doing it
24:11 - sometimes so with standard JS you don't
24:13 - use semicolons okay so all the
24:17 - semicolons are gone and OB and
24:19 - everything still works right it's not
24:21 - nothing's crashed uh
24:25 - so that is an obvious thing here we go
24:30 - this looks different function sticky
24:35 - nav okay so this is a big example of a
24:40 - change right this is really obvious so
24:42 - before we had I actually didn't write
24:44 - this code uh you can see I got this um
24:46 - from someone on codepen and credited and
24:49 - everything so I it's it's legit to use
24:53 - um but everything was written all in one
24:56 - line like that
24:59 - which is pretty hard to read now this is
25:03 - automatically
25:05 - done that it's all moved on to separate
25:08 - lines so yes it takes up more lines
25:11 - certainly but it's so much easier to
25:13 - read like that so that is
25:17 - one really
25:22 - useful kind of change in the uh in the
25:24 - code there the other thing it did was it
25:28 - it made me so it threw an error over
25:31 - this and it made me I was actually had
25:33 - to change
25:34 - this um I had to change this
25:38 - manually it wouldn't let me just use
25:43 - ve and Define all these things I had to
25:46 - use a separate VE for each line so I
25:51 - guess that's good to know that that's
25:53 - that's the default with standard
25:56 - JS so you get the point you can check
25:59 - out you you have access to the repo you
26:01 - can check all this out so I just wanted
26:03 - to show a quick example of how this this
26:06 - works now I will check out the live chat
26:09 - I'm sorry for having ignored you but if
26:11 - you ever watch this you know how I am
26:13 - and once I look at the live chat I tend
26:16 - to just talk a lot and uh to you all and
26:20 - answer questions so uh I wanted to make
26:22 - sure I got through this and wow okay so
26:26 - we pretty much got through most of what
26:28 - I wanted to say in less than half an
26:30 - hour so we'll say
26:32 - this if you are only here to check out
26:35 - prer in standard JS and you don't really
26:37 - care uh for any of the question and
26:39 - answer stuff uh you can uh thanks for
26:42 - watching and uh you don't have to watch
26:45 - anymore because that was the demo uh for
26:48 - all of
26:49 - that but if you do have any questions
26:51 - you want to stick around put them in the
26:53 - live chat I'll go through all the
26:54 - questions in the live chat and I'll I'll
26:56 - provide answers and uh uh a lot of times
26:59 - everybody else in the live chat provides
27:01 - really great answers as well so it's a
27:03 - good resource to you if you can't stick
27:05 - around or you're just nervous about
27:07 - asking a question in the live chat you
27:09 - can direct message me on Twitter or you
27:12 - can put it in the comments uh to this
27:14 - video uh so a link to my Twitter profile
27:17 - is in the description for the video all
27:20 - right so let's get to the chat I'm
27:23 - starting at the top and I'm just working
27:24 - my way
27:26 - down also so let me know I was getting
27:29 - some messages that the stream Health
27:31 - wasn't good so let me know if you you
27:33 - had any problems with this stream that's
27:36 - really odd usually the internet
27:37 - connection that I have um at work is is
27:41 - really really
27:44 - fast okay
27:48 - so everybody everybody if you remember
27:50 - the beginning was kind of shouting out
27:52 - where they are from which is awesome I
27:53 - love to see where you all are from so we
27:55 - had Romania Germany
28:00 - another one from Germany um somebody
28:02 - asked about my editor which uh which is
28:06 - great I don't mind I get asked that
28:08 - almost every video um but I don't really
28:12 - mind uh because you might have just
28:15 - joined in you didn't weren't able to
28:17 - check it out I do have a link in the
28:19 - description to the the tools some of the
28:21 - tools that I use so if you're interested
28:23 - in what I use check out the description
28:25 - I link pretty much everything that I'm
28:28 - using I'm I'm linking in
28:29 - there uh we got somebody else from Los
28:33 - Angeles uh let's
28:38 - see I had said earlier I talked about um
28:42 - I asked if anyone else forgot to eat
28:44 - when they were working uh and Patrick
28:46 - says forget to eat more than I remember
28:48 - to eat Rohan forgets uh sometimes I
28:52 - forget that I've eaten don't even know
28:54 - how that happens so like somewhat the
28:57 - opposite problem
29:03 - um okay so uh surv has a question and
29:07 - this this question was like maybe 20
29:09 - minutes ago so hopefully you're still
29:10 - here if not maybe somebody else had
29:13 - still wants to hear the answer uh ask
29:15 - how is this different from es lent okay
29:18 - so uh vene actually gave an answer uh
29:22 - but I'll read it out in case you're
29:23 - watching this video later on and can't
29:25 - see the live chat and the answer is as I
29:28 - mentioned standard JS uses es lint uh as
29:32 - V says under the hood so kind of in the
29:34 - background it's using ES lent okay so uh
29:38 - but it's using the
29:42 - um the standard all like what is
29:45 - specified in standard JS
29:48 - so you know if you go here and you can
29:52 - read about the JavaScript standard style
29:55 - okay so basically it's it's using ES
29:58 - lint to enforce the JavaScript standard
30:01 - style and you don't have to do any of
30:04 - the formatting like you don't have to
30:06 - configure sorry you don't have to
30:08 - configure es lint at all it does it for
30:11 - you sorry I'm going to take a
30:14 - drink okay
30:18 - um so hopefully that answers uh your
30:20 - question and uh if not uh you know ask
30:24 - for clarification and uh we can talk
30:26 - more about it
30:29 - Andrew says uh hello folks I'll watch
30:32 - the replay on way to home have fun all
30:34 - right thanks for stopping in Andrew uh
30:37 - yeah throw uh you have any questions or
30:39 - anything um later on when you watch it
30:41 - put it in the um comments
30:52 - please all right
30:56 - so Sebastian ask why don't you use a
30:58 - lter for atom so you get the errors as
31:01 - you write them actually to be honest
31:03 - with you I have up on my other screen a
31:06 - couple of atom
31:08 - plugins that were recommended uh from
31:11 - the the page the uh the page for
31:14 - standard JS so I was looking into using
31:18 - plugins for atom to do just that I just
31:21 - didn't have time to get it all working
31:24 - uh before the video so if anyone uses
31:27 - standard JS and uses atom and has a
31:30 - plugin that you want to recommend please
31:32 - let me know and uh cuz i' like I I was
31:36 - trying to read through some plugins to
31:37 - figure out which one was the best to use
31:39 - but I I didn't come to any conclusion
31:52 - yet all right we have someone from Dubai
31:56 - awesome
31:58 - uh noi says nice anyway I'm still
32:00 - learning basic JavaScript in HTML this
32:02 - stream is way above my knowledge we'll
32:04 - come back to it in a few months when I
32:06 - know a little more
32:10 - um so NY yeah not every stream that I do
32:14 - is this high level so some of them are
32:17 - really like basic uh CSS changes or
32:20 - basic JavaScript HTML stuff so um just
32:23 - check out uh if you want like you can
32:26 - follow follow me on Twitter and or
32:29 - subscribe to the free code Camp Channel
32:31 - and then you'll get alerts saying what
32:34 - topic I'm going to be working on each
32:36 - day and maybe there will be a topic
32:38 - that'll be more like at at your level
32:40 - where you're at right now I'm also going
32:42 - to be doing some beginner videos and
32:46 - putting them on my own YouTube channel
32:48 - which is linked in the description so
32:51 - you can check that out as well uh and
32:53 - maybe if you want to subscribe it you
32:56 - don't have to subscribe my channel but
32:57 - you'll get the benefit of being alerted
32:59 - when I do upload those uh I think um
33:03 - since I'll be on vacation next next week
33:05 - I'm going to be at the beach but it's
33:06 - looking like there's going to be some
33:07 - rain so maybe I'll try to get some of
33:10 - those videos done then and so maybe
33:13 - they'll be posted next week uh I think
33:16 - that would be nice since I might not be
33:17 - able to live stream if the internet's
33:18 - down at least May or if the internet's
33:21 - not good enough at least maybe I can
33:22 - upload some of those pre-recorded videos
33:26 - and those are going to be initially
33:28 - aimed at like people who are just
33:36 - beginning all right a high says Noy you
33:39 - will get there I used to be in your
33:40 - shoes eight months ago now I'm
33:42 - interviewing for four companies awesome
33:44 - uh aim high congratulations on that
33:47 - that's that's really uh really awesome
33:50 - to hear um let let me know let us know
33:53 - if you get if you get a job from any of
33:55 - the uh companies
33:57 - I'd love to hear the good news so uh
33:59 - good luck with
34:04 - that uh someone from Orlando sends their
34:06 - greetings hello from Nigeria
34:11 - awesome uh Andrew says if you get in the
34:13 - industry and you're good it escalates
34:16 - quickly so good advice yeah just you
34:19 - know get in there and give it a
34:24 - shot a high says uh it yeah mainly uh
34:30 - free code
34:31 - camp but supplement my learning with you
34:34 - Demi okay
34:35 - so awesome resources obviously free code
34:39 - Camp because if you're here you know
34:41 - about free code camp but Udi also $10
34:43 - courses I have done I did a course from
34:46 - udmi before uh that was like one of
34:49 - those $10 courses and I did like it it
34:51 - was useful I know you if you've heard me
34:53 - before say I don't think I've spent more
34:55 - than like $30 on course coures um
34:58 - learning this
34:59 - stuff but uh udmi was one of the places
35:03 - that I did spend money on and uh I was I
35:06 - was happy with with the
35:08 - course noi says uh learning with
35:14 - Treehouse Treehouse is nice I've looked
35:17 - at treeh house and stuff and um and it
35:20 - looked nice I haven't done that much
35:21 - with it but uh maybe if if anyone
35:24 - watching has some experience with treeh
35:25 - house too and wants to comment about it
35:27 - from what I understand it it seems like
35:29 - it's a pretty good
35:32 - resource um we have someone from
35:35 - Russia
35:39 - awesome so um LOL LOL asks hey Jesse how
35:44 - big is your company how many employees
35:46 - uh we
35:47 - have like 500 employees I think so I
35:51 - work at a
35:53 - university um a university here in the
35:55 - United States and it's a small
35:58 - University so we don't have maybe like
36:02 - 2,000 students so that's that's
36:06 - considered a pretty small um
36:09 - university and we have I think about 500
36:12 - employees and that that includes the
36:15 - professors uh as well so the staff and
36:18 - the faculty combined are about about
36:21 - 500 uh and my particular I I actually
36:24 - work in the marketing department and we
36:26 - we have in my entire department I think
36:29 - it's only about 15 people and my my
36:32 - division within my department there's
36:34 - only three of us uh and only two of us
36:38 - actually do any code so so it's really
36:41 - kind of small I guess that we really
36:43 - only have two people doing code and uh
36:46 - we we almost never even work on the same
36:48 - project because we're just kind of
36:49 - really swamped with projects all the
36:51 - time so I'm usually working by myself as
36:55 - I mentioned earlier I am getting some
36:57 - student workers and maybe I'm trying to
36:59 - set up some internship stuff too maybe
37:01 - for the fall uh so hopefully I'll have
37:04 - some more people working I would really
37:07 - love to have the student workers
37:08 - involved so they can get some good
37:09 - experience uh in using you know GitHub
37:13 - and some more modern build tools and
37:15 - things and get some good experience to
37:17 - put on their portfolio I think that
37:19 - would be
37:20 - awesome so anyway I guess that's you
37:24 - know kind of small small company small
37:26 - University
37:27 - uh we have hello from India
37:33 - awesome noi says what I can stay away
37:37 - from using semicolon and JS yeah who
37:40 - knew right I only recently found that
37:42 - out I guess I'm behind the game though
37:44 - which is I mean that happens if you if
37:47 - you stay off Twitter for a while it's
37:49 - easy to fall
37:50 - behind
37:52 - um aim high says
37:55 - um well it says Noy follow me on on
37:58 - codepen uh just go to codepen and search
38:01 - my username so I don't I don't know if a
38:05 - high meant for me to uh give the
38:09 - username out loud so I'm not so uh I'll
38:13 - just leave it out if you want if you
38:15 - don't mind and you want me to read out
38:16 - your username so people can check out
38:18 - your code pen let me know and I I will
38:20 - do
38:21 - it Rohan prefers the
38:25 - semicolon and LOL LOL also prefers
38:30 - so okay so we have some some debate here
38:34 - about the semicolon I prefer the
38:36 - semicolon simply because I'm familiar
38:38 - with it I'm used to using it but I
38:40 - imagine it will be better if I just get
38:43 - rid of the semicolon that way it's just
38:46 - one less thing I have to worry about one
38:48 - less thing I have to
38:50 - do uh I'm sure it will speed up my my
38:54 - coding ever so slightly but over the
38:56 - long long term that'll probably add up
38:58 - and it'll save me
38:59 - like 10 minutes of time
39:03 - which which would be important I
39:06 - guess
39:09 - um Patrick says I really prefer one ve
39:13 - let or const with commas is there a way
39:15 - to disable that yeah actually so if if
39:18 - you're you're not sure what he's
39:19 - referring to uh we
39:22 - had this comparison
39:25 - here where was it
39:28 - oh okay here so we um when we use
39:34 - prettier or I'm sorry when we use uh
39:37 - standard JS to lint this it said that I
39:41 - had to change this from using this V and
39:44 - just using One V and defining multiple
39:47 - variables to putting each variable being
39:51 - defined with its own V on a separate
39:54 - line there and uh
39:57 - Patrick ask if that can be disabled I'm
39:59 - pretty sure it can there's anything that
40:01 - you can do in es lent in terms of
40:03 - disabling or customizing you can do with
40:05 - standard JS because it's using ES lent
40:09 - uh in the
40:12 - background and if worse comes to worse
40:15 - you could just add in like in a comment
40:17 - tag disable uh es
40:20 - lent if you wanted to and just disable
40:23 - that portion that's that's kind of like
40:26 - would be a pain to have to do that all
40:27 - the time but if you really wanted to
40:29 - that that would
40:31 - work uh Andrew says Jesse have any
40:34 - experience with browser extension so you
40:37 - mean like making a browser extension if
40:39 - if you mean making a browser extension
40:42 - then no I've never actually made my own
40:44 - browser
40:45 - extension uh I have been interested in
40:47 - doing it at times in the past but I just
40:50 - never really like had had the time or
40:52 - like a real need to do
40:55 - it uh but but also at least for my
40:59 - purposes if I wanted to make a browser
41:01 - extension that could do something I it's
41:03 - easier for me to use something like
41:05 - tamper monkey which I do use and then
41:08 - just write the code in tamper monkey and
41:11 - apply
41:12 - it so I kind of get around having to
41:15 - really learn how to make a browser
41:16 - extension and I can still get done what
41:18 - I want to get done
41:20 - so um but otherwise I don't have any
41:23 - direct experience with making uh a
41:25 - browser
41:27 - attention all right we have someone from
41:29 - Palestine
41:33 - welcome
41:37 - and sorry it keeps uh for some reason
41:40 - normally it doesn't do this but today in
41:42 - the live chat I don't know why but I
41:43 - keep getting bounced down to the bottom
41:45 - of the chat so I keep losing my
41:52 - place all right so okay Palestine
41:55 - someone from mov
41:57 - um oh Andrew from malova awesome I have
42:01 - um my my wife has some nieces and
42:03 - nephews and actually one of them is my
42:06 - goddaughter uh who were adopted from
42:08 - mova uh
42:10 - so
42:13 - awesome Nigeria
42:19 - welcome uh daff derp asks are you done
42:22 - uh yeah actually so I know it's it's
42:25 - it's way early right it's I've only been
42:27 - on for 40 minutes so and at the time
42:29 - when you asked that it was I'd only been
42:31 - on for half an hour so yeah basically
42:33 - with for the topic of the the stream I'm
42:37 - done with that so um I know we had
42:40 - talked about doing shorter streams so
42:42 - I'm I'm making an effort to do shorter
42:45 - streams um if you if you missed if
42:48 - you're just coming in and you missed it
42:50 - the replay will be available on free
42:52 - code Camp um just a few minutes after I
42:55 - end the the stream so uh you can watch
42:58 - the
43:02 - replay Andrew says today I made some big
43:05 - rebases and merges had to remove some
43:07 - big files from entire repository history
43:10 - 386 commits wow that's crazy uh
43:13 - yesterday we did a um a stream on doing
43:18 - merges of pool requests and stuff so uh
43:21 - wow that seems
43:23 - like I mean I don't know maybe I don't
43:26 - know what to compare that to but that
43:28 - really seems like a lot of of commits to
43:30 - be working with
43:32 - there um Yong asks where do you deploy
43:36 - the website AWS it's actually digital
43:38 - ocean all right Ro Rohan answered that
43:40 - so yeah digital ocean we do here at the
43:42 - University we have three different hosts
43:44 - right well actually four different hosts
43:46 - the main website which is franciscan.edu
43:49 - is actually hosted here on campus and
43:51 - the IT department runs their own
43:54 - physical servers there okay that that is
43:56 - actually going to change soon and we're
43:58 - going to when we redesign the site which
44:00 - will be like probably the next really
44:02 - major project that I do um I'll do a lot
44:06 - of little projects in between when I
44:08 - start that one but we host that there we
44:11 - host some sites on GoDaddy so we just
44:14 - have like a little shared Hosting
44:16 - account that we just do some really
44:17 - minor stuff with uh but it's easy to
44:20 - it's nice to have because you can do
44:21 - like the oneclick five minute WordPress
44:23 - install and have something going and so
44:26 - um we also host on digital ocean and we
44:29 - have a site on
44:33 - AWS all right we have uh someone from
44:36 - Mexico
44:48 - awesome all right no said thanks Jesse
44:50 - you're
44:54 - welcome all right looks look like
44:56 - somebody was talking about getting
44:57 - discounts on udmi courses and uh mobin
45:01 - 92 says you can go to real. Discount
45:04 - I've never been there so I'm not
45:05 - endorsing the site because I don't I
45:06 - don't know what's on there but uh I
45:08 - guess there's discounts for stuff on
45:11 - there
45:13 - um I'm not sure how to pronounce most of
45:17 - this name but it ends with Isaac and I
45:20 - know how to pronounce Isaac so I'm I'm
45:21 - sorry I just didn't want to mess up your
45:23 - name so I didn't want to attempt it but
45:25 - says which would you advise becoming a
45:27 - full stack developer or front-end
45:29 - developer I
45:33 - um one day I would like to know enough
45:35 - about the backend to be able to say I'm
45:37 - full
45:38 - stack right now I'm only comfortable
45:40 - saying that that I'm front end and my
45:44 - idea was well I'll start with front end
45:47 - and make money with that and then slowly
45:50 - work my way to learn everything learn
45:52 - the back end and be full stack so that
45:54 - was my idea and that's how I wanted to
45:56 - do it I will say if you start from the
45:58 - outset saying I want to be full stack
46:00 - you'll probably get there sooner for me
46:04 - I just had a family you know I need to
46:05 - take care of and I need to pay the bills
46:07 - so it was like okay I'm going to start
46:09 - out because I know I can get money doing
46:12 - frontend work right now uh so I haven't
46:15 - made it to full stack as quickly as I
46:17 - had hoped just because I'm busy you know
46:20 - doing my job as doing front end stuff so
46:23 - it kind of depends on what you want def
46:26 - it's easier to become a front-end
46:27 - developer than a full stack it'll take
46:29 - less time so if you really need to kind
46:31 - of get into it and start making money
46:33 - with It Go Front End first and then
46:34 - learn the rest but if you have the time
46:37 - to just dedicate to learning uh Go full
46:40 - stack and then you'll make more money as
46:41 - a full stack developer uh most likely uh
46:45 - anyway
46:47 - so that's my advice maybe you all in the
46:49 - live chat have some better advice than
46:51 - that or some alternate opinions
46:53 - but uh that's that's kind of my
46:56 - viewpoint on
46:58 - it uh okay there someone from Wales
47:01 - awesome
47:04 - hello Andrew says with time you will be
47:07 - full stack even if you don't want it and
47:10 - uh that's that's kind of true I'm sure
47:12 - Andrew was joking a little bit but that
47:14 - that is actually kind of true if you'll
47:15 - see like if you've watched any of my
47:17 - streams before occasionally I'm doing
47:19 - stuff that's definitely not front-end
47:22 - even though I'm a front-end developer
47:24 - and especially if you're on a small team
47:27 - or
47:27 - freelancing yeah you're going to have to
47:30 - to learn a lot of stuff eventually so um
47:35 - yeah I I mean probably most of us even
47:38 - if we're doing mostly frontend stuff
47:39 - occasionally do have to do backend stuff
47:41 - from time to time so it wouldn't be that
47:43 - much of a jump for us to just do some
47:44 - more learning and and jump in and and be
47:47 - doing full stack not to say that it's
47:49 - easy to be full stack but just to say
47:51 - that that's a natural
47:54 - progression all right have someone from
47:56 - Brazil awesome
47:59 - hello
48:02 - um Andrew says semicolons are noise for
48:05 - me all right so Andrew Andrew is um
48:08 - against semicolons and we have what
48:11 - Rohan and Patrick are on team
48:16 - semicolon Rohan says you could do
48:18 - backend exclusively or networking or
48:21 - full stack it's just what you like yeah
48:23 - I didn't even mention that yeah uh
48:26 - I guess it depends on what you like
48:27 - doing if you don't like doing backend
48:29 - stuff then don't try to be full stack uh
48:32 - if you just like front end stick with
48:33 - that because that's important uh you
48:36 - know you don't want to be stuck doing
48:37 - something that you don't
48:40 - like Rohan says for example I get bored
48:43 - easily with one thing so I would prefer
48:45 - full
48:46 - stack Andrew says or what the company
48:48 - has for you to work yeah that's that's
48:50 - important too you know if you get a job
48:52 - doing one or the other then that's
48:54 - that's what you're G to do
49:00 - Rohan uh said with small to medium
49:02 - companies you are usually you usually
49:04 - are overworked but you do get to try
49:06 - lots of stuff
49:09 - yeah I can understand that bro so that's
49:13 - that's where I'm at right now exactly
49:15 - small company overworked but I do get to
49:18 - do a lot of stuff so I will say this
49:21 - normally my schedule is nice I don't
49:24 - work a lot it's just been crazy for the
49:26 - last month or so so hopefully I can get
49:29 - back to my normal working hours and it
49:32 - won't be so
49:33 - crazy all
49:38 - right Sebastian says I'm Romanian but
49:40 - for the past 8 to9 years have been
49:42 - living in Spain
49:45 - awesome Andrew uh Andrew said he had a
49:49 - year in a company and during that year
49:52 - tried Java schola PHP as a back language
49:56 - and even wrote SQL so definitely a lot
49:59 - of stuff just to do in in one
50:04 - year okay the es lint rule for
50:06 - repetitive ver is one one ve so if
50:11 - you're interested in learning how to get
50:13 - around uh this being able to do this
50:17 - instead of being forced to do this with
50:18 - the es lent the rule is one there so you
50:21 - could disable one there right um or or
50:25 - enable I'm not I forget how that works
50:27 - but basically look up in the docs uh you
50:30 - know do a control fine for one bear
50:32 - that's what you want it's what you want
50:33 - to look
50:38 - for uh Rohan rohan's commenting on the
50:41 - length of the video when I was talking
50:42 - about that that we went from like 2.7
50:45 - hours to 30 minutes big difference so
50:47 - definitely cut it on this video is going
50:49 - to end up being an hour after we get
50:50 - through the Q&A but the actual like I
50:53 - want to say not that I did any coding
50:55 - today today but what would normally be
50:56 - the coding portion was only 25 minutes
50:59 - which may be a
51:01 - record I think in my early streams I I
51:04 - kept it pretty short but that's
51:07 - definitely short compared to what we've
51:08 - been doing uh Joshua asks what UI
51:11 - Library do you like to use with react
51:14 - I've been having trouble with the at bar
51:16 - on material
51:17 - UI uh
51:19 - so for this project I actually use
51:22 - materialize just their regular framework
51:26 - and I've had to adapt things to react at
51:30 - times so uh I don't know that I
51:32 - recommend doing normally I do recommend
51:35 - materialize I really like that framework
51:37 - I've used it a lot and I'm familiar with
51:40 - their all their conventions of like
51:42 - class names and things so it's easy for
51:44 - me to build things rapidly with
51:47 - materialize but I am going to need to
51:50 - switch now that most of what I'm doing
51:52 - is in react I think I'm going to need to
51:54 - switch to something that is is more
51:55 - react specific so I know there is uh
52:00 - someone linked I can't remember maybe it
52:04 - was vet maybe yesterday linked uh
52:07 - to a set of react components that were
52:11 - based on the materialized framework so
52:13 - I'm going to have to check those out I
52:15 - know there's material UI there's
52:16 - material
52:18 - MD or no is it react MD I think I still
52:22 - I must have closed the tab but there was
52:25 - is a uh another material design style
52:28 - react framework that's out there as well
52:30 - and it was MD something
52:33 - um so I don't I don't have a react like
52:38 - component library to recommend to you
52:42 - uh but I mean I have used materialized
52:45 - with react and it's basically worked
52:47 - without without too many issues even
52:50 - though it's not really made for react
52:54 - components
52:58 - Andrew has some good advice uh when for
53:00 - when we were talking about commits and
53:02 - everything uh get commits says when you
53:04 - remove something from the entire
53:06 - repository history every commit changes
53:08 - hashes so you have to be careful and
53:10 - announce to all team members yeah uh
53:14 - definitely keep that in mind when you're
53:16 - trying to decide like what how you're
53:18 - going to merge
53:19 - things and
53:22 - um if you're making changes to your
53:24 - commits
53:27 - how is that going to affect your other
53:29 - team if it's just you then you could
53:31 - pretty much do whatever you want I guess
53:32 - and it won't really matter but if you
53:33 - have a team of people submitting pool
53:36 - requests and all working on the project
53:37 - then uh you you don't want to mess
53:40 - everything up for them so decide on
53:43 - beforehand I guess on how you're going
53:45 - to handle things like that with your
53:47 - team uh V asked did you check now.sh for
53:51 - hosting actually I I went to a
53:53 - conference where they demonstrated how
53:55 - to use now uh to get a site up and
53:57 - running and you can even buy domain
53:59 - names right through the command line it
54:00 - was really awesome and quick so I am
54:03 - familiar with using
54:05 - that uh I think I think I would like to
54:09 - use it at some point I mean obviously
54:11 - not for this project we already have
54:13 - everything set up uh but possibly for
54:16 - some smaller projects I would like to do
54:18 - that um I'm not sure like I mean
54:21 - obviously we're doing some low balancing
54:23 - and we have this running on multiple
54:24 - servers
54:25 - and then there's so there's a lot more
54:27 - going on here but I think there will be
54:31 - some smaller sites that I'll be working
54:33 - on in the near future I think that would
54:36 - be a good candidate for trying that out
54:39 - uh I'll have to look into the pricing as
54:40 - well because obviously I would want to
54:43 - use if I'm doing this officially for my
54:46 - job we're going to be using a you know a
54:48 - custom domain and I think if you use
54:50 - your own domain at that
54:52 - point you have to be using I I don't
54:55 - remember the pricing structure but uh
54:57 - anyway I'll have to check the only thing
54:59 - basically I need to look into is the
55:00 - pricing and to see if it would make
55:01 - sense to do it like that but otherwise
55:03 - I'm very impressed with using now uh for
55:08 - hosting so if you're not familiar with
55:10 - that the same people that do nextjs
55:13 - which is the basically kind of I don't I
55:16 - don't know what the right term for it is
55:17 - but like the scaffolding for that I'm
55:20 - using to build with
55:22 - react that same those same people do now
55:27 - which is a way to very easily deploy
55:30 - straight from the command line uh right
55:32 - to hosting and uh it's it's just it's so
55:35 - simple uh you know definitely check it
55:37 - out I don't want to spend a lot of time
55:39 - describing what I saw at this conference
55:41 - because you could probably just find the
55:43 - video a video of it or check it out for
55:45 - yourself and see but I mean literally as
55:47 - I mentioned you you can do as much as
55:49 - even buy a domain name right from the
55:51 - command line and in a few commands have
55:53 - a completely new website up and running
55:55 - with your own custom domain and an SSL
55:58 - and all that uh it's really really uh
56:01 - kind of slick and uh nice
56:06 - process
56:08 - um noi says uh LOL Jesse I'm following
56:12 - the same footsteps I'm focusing on front
56:14 - end then later on back end but I want to
56:16 - get my foot in with front end yeah I I
56:18 - mean I don't think it's a bad like I
56:20 - said it depends on what you need you
56:22 - what point in life you're and what you
56:23 - need I mean for me it just like I didn't
56:27 - have time to just spend a lot of time
56:29 - studying and and dedicate my time to
56:32 - that I needed to make money like
56:34 - literally I had quit a
56:36 - job and I was looking for work and
56:39 - couldn't find work and I needed to make
56:42 - money and learn something so I caught a
56:44 - break and a friend of mine had a
56:47 - marketing company that needed some
56:49 - website work someone to do website work
56:52 - and you know I was getting some work on
56:54 - the side with them
56:56 - and the only the way for me to get even
56:58 - more work was to learn this stuff
57:00 - so that that was what just what I needed
57:03 - to do um because I I had a family I had
57:06 - to pay bills so if I had to do it again
57:08 - maybe I would have and I I was
57:11 - completely single with not a lot of
57:14 - responsibilities maybe I would have
57:16 - tried to like just dedicate a bunch of
57:18 - time to just learning and be you know be
57:21 - full stack but uh either way I think is
57:24 - is definitely respectable legitimate way
57:26 - of going it just depends on what you
57:29 - need uh Matt says it pays to spend the
57:32 - time to really learn one aspect first
57:35 - okay so awesome yeah something to be
57:37 - said for focusing I guess on on focusing
57:39 - your attention on one thing uh Sebastian
57:42 - asks where should I start looking for
57:44 - work as a front-end Dev uh and we have
57:47 - some answers in the live chat I'll read
57:49 - them out Rohan says oh this isn't an
57:52 - answer to that question uh Andrew says
57:54 - stack over flow so yeah definitely stack
57:56 - Overflow has this whole job uh board
57:59 - that's that's really
58:01 - awesome so let me bring this
58:04 - up just in in case I'm sure most of you
58:07 - are familiar with stack Overflow but if
58:08 - you haven't seen the jobs yet there you
58:11 - see the jobs right here right and they
58:14 - they will show you jobs based on what
58:16 - you searched for on stack Overflow like
58:18 - assuming you have an account and
58:19 - everything and uh and they have your
58:22 - data and uh usually like they awesome
58:25 - jobs like you know check this out
58:26 - front-end developer 90 to 130k that's
58:30 - insane that's that's a lot of money um
58:34 - way more than than I make uh so you know
58:37 - if you check it out you get lots of
58:40 - details about the job right there you
58:42 - know so I would just check it out check
58:45 - out there and then it's as simple as
58:48 - this and you get a lot of other related
58:51 - jobs I've been really impressed with
58:53 - stacker overflow we're actually
58:55 - advertising uh a position here at this
58:58 - University for a web developer on stack
59:00 - Overflow right now uh and I was really
59:03 - the one who pushed for like we need to
59:05 - list on stack Overflow because I was so
59:07 - impressed with how they do things uh and
59:11 - and how they suggest jobs to to people
59:14 - uh I thought that was kind of
59:17 - really really like no other site has has
59:20 - that kind of data and that user base um
59:23 - to be able to do what overflow jobs does
59:25 - so if you're looking to get like a
59:27 - full-time job definitely do that if you
59:29 - want to just find freelance work then
59:32 - networking with people directly I found
59:34 - to be way better than going on one of
59:36 - the freelance job sites the jobs I got
59:39 - from those sites were usually not very
59:41 - high paying and they didn't they didn't
59:44 - amount to much like I didn't get like
59:47 - repeat clients or a lot of good leads
59:48 - from there that was just my experience
59:51 - uh the better clients were were personal
59:54 - connection
59:55 - and I would have a client that they were
59:56 - really impressed with what I did and
59:58 - then they recommended me to other people
60:00 - they knew and then it just kind of grew
60:02 - my like freelance business grew
60:04 - naturally like that so it takes a little
60:06 - while but those clients were were repeat
60:09 - clients and they were great to work with
60:13 - uh so that I had a better experience
60:14 - with
60:19 - that
60:23 - um
60:25 - we had some there was some uh discussion
60:28 - more about whether to go full stack or
60:30 - front end first Rohan prefers networking
60:33 - in backend but hasn't really had a real
60:35 - job yet so uh don't doesn't really know
60:38 - for sure Matt says better to focus in
60:40 - One Direction or uh or the other and
60:44 - that leads to deeper understanding in
60:46 - one spot yeah definitely I mean if if
60:47 - you force yourself to focus you're going
60:49 - to be way better at that one thing than
60:50 - you ever would have if you didn't uh
60:53 - there's a quote from somebody I have no
60:55 - idea who it was but I read a book before
60:57 - and uh they were saying that to be great
61:00 - at something you have to say no to
61:02 - everything else right so you you have to
61:06 - focus on that one thing uh if you want
61:08 - to be as great as you possibly can at
61:10 - that one thing even though you could be
61:13 - great at at lots of different things if
61:14 - you would have choose to do those things
61:17 - uh you have to focus on one if if you
61:19 - want to be really good so I definitely
61:21 - agree with that I mean I'm there are
61:22 - some really talented people that are
61:23 - Greatful developers but even then if
61:26 - they would have focused all their
61:28 - attention I think on on one area they
61:31 - could have been even better at that one
61:33 - area than they already are uh so but I
61:37 - mean you need you need people of all you
61:39 - need some people that don't want to
61:41 - focus and want to have a more broad
61:43 - understanding uh so and
61:46 - there's there are jobs for all different
61:48 - types of people depending on what you
61:50 - want to do if you want to focus or if
61:51 - you want to be have a more general
61:53 - knowledge of more things
61:59 - uh Zachary says it feels like the line
62:01 - between front and back end is so blurred
62:03 - in the JS
62:05 - world I I agree there there's definitely
62:07 - some blurring there I mean because
62:09 - you're running JavaScript on client side
62:11 - and server side uh so it it feels a lot
62:15 - of it does feel the same like when I
62:17 - switch
62:18 - over like you know I'm doing front-end
62:21 - stuff basically but you know I have this
62:24 - this server.js file like have have I now
62:27 - switched to the backend world just with
62:29 - one click here like it's still all the
62:32 - same thing I'm using const I'm I'm using
62:34 - JavaScript like it it is it does feel
62:37 - weird sometimes um you know like where
62:41 - where is that that line
62:45 - but uh but anyway I mean like I said I I
62:47 - think most of what I do is front-end so
62:50 - it's clear in my mind that I'm a
62:51 - front-end developer uh even though I do
62:54 - backend stuff
62:58 - occasionally uh Blazer Tron all right so
63:00 - we're back to the semicolon debate
63:02 - Blazer Tron says learning the basics of
63:04 - JS but I'd rather use semicolons mainly
63:06 - because I've been told that yeah I'm in
63:08 - the same boat that's I I don't I'm I'm
63:11 - probably going to try not to use
63:13 - semicolons as much as possible and
63:15 - certainly now that it's going to
63:16 - automatically take them out for me I'm
63:17 - not going to have them but um yeah I've
63:21 - always been told use semicolon so it is
63:23 - kind of a weird thing although learning
63:24 - to use react was the same way cuz you've
63:26 - always been
63:27 - told don't put your CSS in line and mix
63:31 - it with with your HTML and then we come
63:34 - to react and we have JavaScript HTML and
63:37 - CSS all mixed together right it just
63:40 - seems
63:41 - weird once you get used to it it's
63:44 - actually really nice uh but it's hard at
63:52 - first uh person it seems like the live
63:56 - chat the is like a NeverEnding um chat
64:00 - today so which is great it looks like we
64:02 - have some great discussion going on here
64:04 - so I'm going to keep yeah I I'd say
64:07 - probably we can get through this in
64:08 - about 10 minutes so about 10 minutes I'm
64:10 - going to end uh so I can kind of get
64:13 - move on to uh do some some other work
64:16 - that is probably boring and I don't even
64:18 - don't want to put on a live stream um so
64:22 - if you got a question get it in in about
64:23 - 10 minutes I can't get all the questions
64:25 - then uh please put them in the um uh in
64:29 - the
64:30 - comments or direct message me on Twitter
64:33 - and I will answer them so person asks
64:37 - how long have you been learning I've
64:39 - been learning for the past year and it
64:40 - feels like I'm not progressing
64:42 - anywhere I've been learning this for a
64:44 - long
64:46 - time I first learned how to build
64:49 - websites in 2003 somewhere around there
64:52 - and that was just basic stuff we we just
64:54 - opened up notepad on on a PC and started
64:58 - doing basic HTML and CSS and doing
65:01 - layout with tables and things like that
65:03 - uh
65:05 - so but I I didn't really do that much
65:07 - with it after that so I would
65:10 - say I've only really been like intensely
65:14 - trying to learn JavaScript in particular
65:17 - for like maybe the
65:21 - last four years five years I I don't
65:25 - even want to say five like maybe maybe
65:27 - the last three or four years have I
65:29 - really been focused on getting better at
65:31 - JavaScript before that I was doing
65:33 - websites but I was I wasn't like
65:36 - intentionally saying I want to get
65:38 - really good with JavaScript it was more
65:40 - I was focusing more on CSS at that point
65:44 - so I'd say three years of of more
65:46 - intense Focus uh to get where I'm at
65:49 - right
65:51 - now uh so don't don't be discouraged if
65:55 - it feels like you're not
65:57 - progressing it doesn't always go uh
66:01 - sometimes you learn a lot really fast
66:02 - and you feel awesome and then you work
66:05 - for a long time and it feels like you're
66:06 - not getting anywhere uh and then you'll
66:09 - hit another like spurt like a gross
66:11 - spurt right remember when when we were
66:13 - kids and you
66:15 - just like you'd go to have summer break
66:18 - and you'd come back to school and some
66:19 - people would be like Giants and cuz they
66:22 - hit a gross SP right the same thing
66:23 - happen and coding that's probably a
66:25 - terrible analogy but uh the same thing
66:28 - does happen with coding like all of a
66:30 - sudden you just like it seems like
66:32 - things are just all making sense and you
66:37 - you just get really good and and then
66:39 - you'll hit another Plateau you'll have a
66:41 - point where it doesn't seem like you're
66:43 - progressing but just because it doesn't
66:45 - seem like you're
66:46 - progressing like you you are you're
66:48 - learning things you're retaining things
66:50 - it just needs to fit together uh for for
66:54 - you so uh if this is something you
66:56 - really want to do and you enjoy doing
66:58 - doing then stick with it don't get
67:01 - discouraged uh I'm constantly looking
67:04 - back at things I did even a few months
67:05 - ago and saying wow like I I definitely
67:08 - would do it differently now I've I've
67:09 - learn you know I've gotten better uh so
67:12 - and you you'll get there you'll have a
67:13 - bunch of those
67:16 - moments Patrick is going back to the
67:19 - semicolon thing Patrick does not care
67:21 - about semicolons like in and of
67:23 - themselves but more about consistency so
67:26 - if you're doing Simple JS with no
67:28 - tooling preventing you uh from then use
67:31 - semicolons if so I guess use whatever
67:34 - you're used to using if you don't have
67:36 - tooling to make it consistent for you so
67:39 - that that seems to be Patrick's Point
67:41 - there which is a good
67:43 - point
67:45 - um person clarified uh the question a
67:49 - little bit but I think I I answered that
67:52 - Matt Matt response to person says it
67:55 - starts slow but it can really pick up
67:57 - find some projects doing something you
67:59 - enjoy and it will pick up fast the more
68:02 - you enjoy it the easier it will be for
68:04 - you to spend more time with your head in
68:06 - it good advice Matt uh in person ask any
68:11 - projects you recommend I'd love to work
68:13 - on
68:14 - some
68:17 - so
68:19 - H I don't I don't know what your level
68:22 - is out in terms of project
68:24 - I know there are some websites that just
68:26 - have project ideas I don't remember what
68:29 - the addresses are for those sites now
68:31 - but I'm sure if you kind of search for
68:33 - that concept you'll find some uh you
68:36 - could also try you know some of the like
68:39 - coding tutorials have projects you could
68:41 - work on like free code Camp if you
68:44 - haven't gone through free code Camp
68:46 - stuff there are a lot of projects and
68:49 - you don't have to go through everything
68:50 - to get there first you could just pick
68:51 - one out and try it if you want just to
68:53 - get an idea
68:55 - or you can sometimes I just ask people
68:58 - like friends and family like hey if do
69:00 - you have any good ideas for websites or
69:02 - apps or anything like that and see if
69:05 - there's a good idea uh that they have
69:08 - that you could work on especially if
69:10 - they're not coders then they're
69:12 - obviously never going to do that they're
69:14 - they're never going to use their ideas
69:15 - so there uh they'd probably be really
69:17 - happy if you Tred to make their idea uh
69:20 - really
69:22 - happen
69:26 - uh Noy says Hey Jesse I just installed
69:28 - standard and the bracket brackets
69:31 - extension is that
69:35 - it okay so I I'm all right so I don't
69:40 - use brackets so I'm just assuming that
69:42 - it's similar enough to adom that this
69:44 - would work so you'll need
69:48 - to if you're using the extension then
69:51 - that should give you the warnings
69:54 - right there so yeah that should work you
69:56 - should as long as you're seeing the uh
69:58 - the warnings about syntax in in your
70:02 - editor then you're good to go it may not
70:05 - work exactly like mine's working where
70:07 - it like automatically uh checks
70:09 - everything as soon as I get a do a
70:13 - commit uh so that part you might need to
70:17 - set up differently but if you just want
70:19 - like the linting in editor then you
70:21 - should be good to go
70:24 - somebody who maybe uses brackets might
70:26 - be able if if you're in the live chat
70:29 - now maybe you'll be able to give some
70:30 - better uh more specific
70:40 - advice all right Andrew has good advice
70:42 - uh kind of along the lines with what I
70:44 - was my saying my experience was was
70:46 - check your code from one year ago and if
70:49 - you feel it needs Improvement then then
70:51 - you've grown that's great advice yeah if
70:53 - if you look at code you did from an
70:55 - earlier time and you notice things like
70:58 - oh I I should have done this differently
71:00 - or I can correct that then you know
71:02 - you've learned you know you've improved
71:04 - because obviously when you wrote it you
71:07 - didn't know enough to make it the right
71:10 - way like it should have been so great
71:15 - advice Matt says about two years ago I
71:18 - went on a family vacation to Alaska and
71:20 - to share pictures I set up a website to
71:22 - upload and display photo
71:24 - videos uh think like private Facebook
71:27 - yeah that's a really good idea so that
71:30 - that's a good idea of uh a project to do
71:33 - uh you know if you're interested in
71:36 - something like
71:37 - that thanks for that I I really like
71:39 - that idea I might Matt I might do that
71:43 - that might be a legit idea for me to
71:45 - work on on vacation and not have
71:48 - everybody be mad at me for working on
71:50 - vacation because I'm actually doing
71:52 - something that will contribute to the
71:55 - vacation so that's good I I'm I'm going
71:57 - to share a little personal thing right
71:59 - here uh I hope you don't mind but my
72:02 - wife's I'm going on vacation with all my
72:04 - wife's side of the family so her
72:05 - brothers and their wives and their kids
72:07 - and my mother and father-in-law and some
72:10 - of her aunts and and and her uncles so
72:13 - all her side of the family they're very
72:15 - creative and like musically talented so
72:18 - there's always like these times where
72:21 - like okay we're going to have like a
72:22 - talent night like everybody write a
72:23 - story and we're going to read it out to
72:25 - him or uh we're going to we're going to
72:27 - play songs or music and I have no
72:29 - musical ability at all I really like
72:32 - music I like to listen to music but I I
72:35 - can't make music I'm not a good singer
72:38 - like nothing and uh when I hear like I
72:42 - got an email saying we're going to do
72:44 - like a contest about writing a story on
72:46 - vacation and I get like anxiety over
72:49 - that like I don't really want to write
72:50 - the story and to me I'm like can can I
72:53 - just make a website would that work
72:57 - because that makes me excited but the
72:59 - other stuff makes me have anxiety so the
73:03 - the reason why I shared that was I'm
73:05 - thinking maybe instead of me
73:08 - contributing with some musical thing or
73:10 - a story my contribution could be some
73:13 - very useful website uh that can capture
73:17 - that family vacation and everybody can
73:19 - go to it and remember it so uh so Matt
73:23 - thanks for that idea because I might
73:25 - actually do that we'll see I don't want
73:28 - to work all a vacation I really do want
73:29 - to hang out with my family and and my
73:31 - kids but it would be nice to just code a
73:35 - little
73:36 - bit I don't know I just feel if I go for
73:39 - a long time without coding I feel weird
73:42 - like I miss it I don't does anybody else
73:44 - ever get that feeling uh on the negative
73:47 - side I I think like maybe I'm addicted
73:49 - to coding and this is a problem on the
73:52 - positive side I think hey do I found
73:54 - something that I really love to do uh so
73:57 - it could go one way or another depending
73:59 - on how you want to look at it but but
74:00 - I'm interested to see if anybody else
74:02 - feels like that let let me know I
74:05 - suspect somebody else has to feel like
74:07 - that I can't be I can't be the only one
74:11 - and if I am then maybe I do need to get
74:13 - some professional help need to need to
74:17 - talk to a counselor or
74:19 - something
74:21 - um Matt says in in regard to that site
74:24 - that Facebook like site um uh he worked
74:28 - with PHP HTML CSS and
74:32 - JavaScript and getting ready to rewrite
74:34 - it in D Jango uh so he says in my
74:38 - current role I am uh a DBA leading up
74:40 - ajango project to rewrite our main
74:42 - application
74:46 - awesome all right so Rohan says
74:48 - Improvement if I see code from 7 to 10
74:50 - months ago I feel like killing someone
74:52 - until I realized this was
74:55 - me that's great I I love that that
74:58 - sentiment right
75:00 - so I cringe when I look at old code
75:04 - occasionally I'm pleasantly surprised
75:05 - and I'm like oh this isn't as bad as I
75:07 - thought it would be but sometime usually
75:09 - I'm like I don't even want to look at it
75:12 - I just like all right this site still
75:14 - works like I'm just going to let it go I
75:16 - don't I don't want to revisit
75:19 - this uh pum says that's awesome I
75:22 - haven't had much inspiration
75:23 - and um Andrew I just checked my stuff
75:26 - from a year ago you're right there was
75:27 - definitely improvements thanks all right
75:29 - I'm I'm glad that that we could help um
75:32 - I definitely want this live chat and the
75:35 - community that's starting to develop
75:36 - around it to be a very like positive
75:38 - uplifting Community especially for
75:40 - people who are new uh I think that
75:42 - that's there's a lot of good tutorials
75:45 - and resources for new people uh and I
75:48 - want it to be like that but I think more
75:50 - importantly this could be a place of
75:52 - inspiration and encouragement uh for
75:55 - people that are just starting and for
75:57 - those of us you know that've been doing
75:58 - it for a little longer and maybe just
76:00 - kind of getting a little bit down about
76:02 - things so um that's something that I
76:05 - think you can't get from just reading a
76:07 - tutorial not necess you know you can't
76:08 - necessarily get that uh but in a more
76:11 - like active Living Community like this
76:14 - we can help each other out in that way
76:16 - and um at least for me that's that's if
76:20 - that happens if that's what this ends up
76:22 - being this stream and and all of you
76:25 - that watch and contribute if it ends up
76:27 - being a place that encourages people uh
76:30 - to learn how to code and continue in it
76:33 - uh then I'll be happy and I'll I'll
76:37 - be I'll be happy that I did sacrifice
76:40 - some of the time and the effort to do
76:47 - this uh daf der says what's a good
76:50 - resource for react convention Within in
76:53 - a large project I'm always confused on
76:55 - how much I should put into a single
76:57 - component um I'm sure
77:00 - that you probably get an answer
77:02 - somewhere but in the live chat for this
77:05 - uh dafter but I would say your
77:08 - components should be like as small as
77:10 - possible they should be only like one
77:12 - thing and you you may end up with a ton
77:14 - of components but it's been my
77:16 - understanding that the correct way to do
77:17 - things and react is that like if
77:20 - something can reasonably be broken down
77:22 - into a smaller component then do it uh
77:25 - and then that keeps them it keeps them
77:28 - small it keeps them easy to understand
77:30 - and more modular so that you can reuse
77:33 - them so uh does that make sense let me
77:35 - know if I need to explain that more if
77:37 - that didn't make sense or if if any of
77:39 - you disagree uh with that viewpoint but
77:41 - that's that's my understanding of of
77:43 - ideally how it should work when you're
77:45 - using
77:48 - react um let's see I'm looking we're
77:52 - getting bad
77:54 - yeah we we've hit definitely hit that 10
77:56 - minutes of where I said I wanted to end
77:58 - so I'm just going to look see if there's
78:00 - any like really important questions I
78:01 - want to get to especially from somebody
78:03 - who's new or maybe just learning uh
78:05 - because I definitely want to uh not that
78:07 - I don't appreciate all of you that are
78:08 - more experienced and and are in the live
78:11 - chat a lot but um I know you won't be
78:13 - offended if I don't get your question I
78:15 - don't want to I don't want to offend
78:16 - somebody if this is their first time
78:18 - asking a question and they get ignored
78:21 - so um let's see so Cactus asks what
78:26 - about markup developer what if you don't
78:30 - want to create markups but you have to
78:32 - do this front and Dev oh so like mockups
78:35 - so you're talking about design work
78:37 - right so uh Cactus correct me if I'm
78:39 - wrong but I think you're talking about
78:41 - design work like what if you have to do
78:44 - design work as a front-end Dev but you
78:46 - don't want to um well I would say either
78:50 - if you can talk to your your boss uh uh
78:53 - about it and see if maybe you can get a
78:55 - real designer or contract that out or
78:57 - something then do it otherwise I mean
78:59 - maybe look for another another job I do
79:02 - have to do design work even though I'm a
79:04 - front end
79:06 - developer I don't always like doing the
79:08 - design work especially at the beginning
79:10 - of a project when it's like a blank
79:12 - slate I'm always that's the worst part
79:14 - for me cuz I could I could make it look
79:17 - like anything you know so it's just hard
79:21 - to make a decision
79:23 - uh but I would imagine I mean how many
79:25 - people watching are front-end developers
79:27 - and also have to do design work uh I
79:30 - know I do for sure I imagine that's
79:33 - somewhat common depending on you know
79:35 - how big a company you work for so um but
79:38 - if if you definitely don't want to be
79:40 - doing that then I would recommend you
79:41 - know try to find a different job or try
79:43 - to bring that up you know in your team
79:46 - and and see if something else could be
79:48 - done you know you may have to keep doing
79:50 - it for a while until you can find
79:52 - something better but uh I mean I totally
79:54 - I'm in the same situation so I
79:56 - definitely understand
80:00 - that
80:03 - um let's
80:06 - see I'm just looking for questions right
80:17 - now usually I do read everything out and
80:20 - uh you all know that if you've seen it
80:21 - before so but
80:23 - um since this is going on pretty long
80:26 - that's why I'm skipping a little
80:30 - bit aim high asks uh hi Jesse so all
80:35 - what you are doing is caching on the
80:37 - server side all your routings on the
80:39 - front end um kind of so yeah basically
80:44 - the once the page
80:47 - loads uh so I did I have had the server
80:49 - up here for a while so what happens is
80:54 - nextjs has I'll go here and show you so
80:58 - in get initial props this fetch of the
81:02 - data happens on the server side so the
81:04 - initial page load and everything it all
81:07 - gets rendered server side and just the
81:09 - HTML you know is pushed out for search
81:12 - engine purposes that's that's good but
81:14 - once the page loads and you click on an
81:17 - internal link then you get no page
81:21 - refresh it's it is it's all client side
81:25 - um routing
81:27 - and the um the API calls that would
81:31 - normally be here and run on the server
81:33 - now can run on the client as well but I
81:37 - am doing a lot of caching so potentially
81:40 - those calls don't even get made if they
81:42 - don't need to so you can see like in the
81:46 - server like I'm caching it for an hour
81:50 - um not in when I'm development minute I
81:53 - don't cash it for an hour but so it's
81:54 - caching the rendered HTML where the API
81:57 - call has already been made on the server
81:59 - they've gotten that data rendered all
82:00 - HTML that's
82:02 - cached so you can get like a really
82:06 - quick response from the server because
82:09 - it it only has to go to the node server
82:10 - and to go right back it doesn't actually
82:12 - have to ask uh WordPress for anything
82:14 - because it's already cached that so
82:16 - that's what I'm doing there and then it
82:19 - does switch over so if if you go to the
82:21 - site kattic
82:23 - uh and check
82:25 - out the uh
82:28 - routing oh man it's so weird I switched
82:30 - to my mouse I'm not on my trackpad now
82:32 - it's really weird to uh try to find all
82:34 - my
82:35 - windows uh but basically yeah if you try
82:38 - to route and you'll notice there is no
82:40 - page refresh so it's a combination of
82:42 - server side and and client side uh
82:45 - rendering
82:47 - routing good question
82:49 - though let me know if you have any other
82:52 - question uh put it in the comments or
82:53 - direct message me on Twitter if you if
82:55 - you want to like talk about it in more
82:57 - depth as to like how how and why I did
83:02 - it Rohan says I'm addicted too got to do
83:07 - something aim high I feel you Jesse okay
83:10 - I'm not the only
83:11 - one um Rohan says uh is saying partic in
83:16 - particular to person but every this goes
83:18 - for everybody that's uh that's watching
83:21 - now live or later on if you want us to
83:24 - help outside of here you can drop by in
83:27 - our IRC anytime so we do have an IRC
83:30 - Channel um for this for this stream and
83:35 - it's uh # FCC Jessie so # FCC
83:41 - Jess so you can join that um I'm in

83:52 - uh so but I try to pop in you know a
83:55 - couple times a day and there are other
83:57 - people that are in there too so if you
83:58 - need help with something you know come
84:00 - in there and ask some questions or if
84:02 - you're more advanced and you want to
84:04 - help some people come in there and and
84:05 - provide some of your your
84:12 - experience uh Rohan says apart from
84:15 - those uh
84:19 - Patrick uh Jesse and a few other nobody
84:22 - here is even in the neighborhood of
84:24 - awesome I don't I don't think I should
84:26 - be put on the list of awesome either but
84:28 - uh says we can definitely improve I
84:30 - would say the only thing awesome about
84:32 - me is that for some reason I decided it
84:35 - would be a good idea to show the world
84:36 - how much of a noob I am every day uh
84:40 - when I do coding um I don't I don't know
84:43 - that everybody would be able to do that
84:45 - so that's that maybe is something unique
84:47 - about
84:48 - me but uh really you all help me so much
84:53 - uh with with my improving my skills that
84:56 - um I think I'm getting just as much if
84:58 - not more out of this than you are Andrew
85:01 - says now stop posting Jesse will not
85:03 - finish this endless
85:04 - conversation thanks Andrew uh that is
85:07 - true yeah I
85:10 - um I just can't stand to leave questions
85:12 - unanswered if you all have questions you
85:14 - know maybe maybe you really need that
85:17 - question answered it can make a big
85:19 - difference in your life so I just want
85:20 - to answer it but all right but this will
85:22 - be it
85:24 - um last
85:26 - question Rohan asks what would be your
85:29 - next project if you are allowed to
85:31 - reveal
85:33 - it all right let me think what will the
85:35 - next project
85:37 - be I don't know for sure how the order
85:40 - is going to be so I'll tell you maybe
85:42 - one or two that's
85:44 - possible
85:48 - um there's going to be potentially a
85:51 - site that that doesn't really have a
85:53 - name or Ur or anything yet but could
85:55 - possibly aggregate content from all of
85:58 - our other university sites into one
86:00 - place and pull it all in if I do that
86:03 - site I'm going to use the WordPress API
86:05 - because a lot of our sites are running
86:06 - WordPress and I'm going to pull it all
86:08 - in it's going to be a react site it's
86:09 - going to be set up similar to this but
86:10 - of course better because why why do a
86:14 - say site exactly like you did the last
86:15 - one right you want to improve so it'll
86:17 - be similar to this if I do that it'll be
86:19 - cool because I'll get to start right
86:21 - from scratch and show the whole way
86:23 - which I know you know a lot of people
86:25 - have been asking for that to start from
86:26 - scratch so that's one potential project
86:29 - that it's going to happen like I'm like
86:32 - 90% sure what's going to happen I'm just
86:33 - not sure when um the other project that
86:36 - I was working on before this if you look
86:38 - on my YouTube channel I did a couple of
86:41 - live streams where I was trying
86:44 - to do a redesign of our main website
86:47 - franciscan.edu but I was trying to limit
86:49 - it like within the restrictions of the
86:51 - current current content management
86:53 - system that will get replaced so
86:56 - basically I was trying to make that site
86:57 - look nice and run as fast as possible
86:59 - within the constraints that I have to
87:01 - work in so that was kind of a weird
87:04 - situation but made it interesting
87:06 - because I couldn't use a lot of the
87:08 - tools and the techniques that I would
87:10 - like to use because of those constraints
87:13 - so those two projects are for sure
87:15 - happening there might be some little
87:16 - like onepage sites that'll pop in here
87:18 - and there but that
87:23 - that's about as good of an answer as I
87:25 - can give you right now
87:29 - and shoot Andrew did ask one more
87:32 - question and it's a followup to an
87:33 - earlier question so I'm going to take it
87:35 - because technically I don't think it's
87:37 - really new just a
87:38 - clarification uh Andrew is saying so the
87:41 - server side also fetches data from
87:44 - WordPress or is only HTML gets to the
87:46 - front end and then fetches so this is to
87:49 - clarify before from Aim High's question
87:52 - it actually does fetch the data on the
87:54 - server so if you want to test it out I'm
87:57 - not going to do it right now because
87:58 - then I'll be here for another 10 minutes
88:00 - but go to the
88:02 - website on your first load of the
88:04 - website so don't do don't click any
88:06 - links on the first
88:08 - load uh go to view source so don't use
88:12 - the inspector view the source and it you
88:15 - know it'll come up with a really ugly
88:16 - looking white page with HTML you'll be
88:19 - able to see all the data right there
88:22 - right if it was fetching at client side
88:24 - you wouldn't see all the data You' just
88:26 - see the initial markup that gets loaded
88:28 - all right but it's actually making the
88:31 - API call server side first and then
88:33 - sending it all comp all completed and
88:36 - rendered out the way it should look that
88:39 - way search engines see the complete page
88:43 - otherwise search engines wouldn't see
88:44 - all that data that we're pulling from
88:47 - WordPress so that's the main reason why
88:49 - we do it I I have I haven't tested Ted
88:52 - it this myself but I've heard other
88:53 - people say that you get a slightly
88:56 - faster first page load if you do it that
88:58 - way as well
89:01 - so finally gotten to the end of the uh
89:05 - live chat I did go kind of fast at the
89:07 - end so if I missed your question I
89:09 - sincerely apologize and please ask it in
89:11 - the comments or message me on Twitter
89:13 - and I will answer it as soon as I can
89:17 - thank you uh to everybody for watching
89:19 - we had a lot of action in the live chat
89:21 - a lot of viewers uh I think above
89:24 - average for most of the the stream we
89:28 - had above average amount of viewers so
89:30 - thank you so much uh for everything for
89:33 - all the input you all had I'll be back
