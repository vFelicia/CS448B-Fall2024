00:00 - he is the creator
00:02 - of
00:03 - 100 days of code it's a movement that
00:05 - helps
00:06 - so many people around the world stay
00:08 - motivated and keep moving forward with
00:10 - their coding
00:11 - uh so alex how's everything going with
00:14 - you
00:14 - hi um everything is well with me
00:17 - everything's going going real really
00:19 - well
00:20 - yeah
00:21 - yeah well
00:23 - first of all congratulations on product
00:25 - hunt a couple days ago you were featured
00:28 - on product hunt and you were considered
00:30 - the number one product of the day with i
00:32 - think
00:33 - 700 or so up votes how many uploads do
00:36 - they have yeah now we're at 700 plus
00:39 - yeah it was surprising and it was really
00:41 - random because i haven't considered like
00:43 - 100 days of code is not really a product
00:45 - it's a product in a sense that bullet
00:47 - journal is a product it's more like a
00:49 - system
00:50 - of how you go about doing things it's a
00:52 - system of rules so i was hesitant for
00:54 - the longest time to actually release it
00:57 - on proto hunt um
00:59 - but uh i was actually at the freecad
01:02 - camp toronto with my friend um
01:05 - uh here uh so he just suggested
01:09 - um
01:10 - just a sec
01:12 - um so he he suggested um
01:14 - just to post it for me
01:16 - and um
01:17 - that was really nice of him i think uh
01:20 - but um just a second
01:23 - yeah so um we posted it randomly it was
01:26 - like saturday at 12 so um
01:30 - and for the whole day we got like 11
01:32 - upvotes i was like okay at least we got
01:34 - the name um scheduled you know like uh
01:38 - taken by us it's not somebody who's
01:39 - gonna come up and just you know um
01:42 - kind of
01:43 - get the spot um but when i woke up the
01:46 - next day um we got already more than 100
01:49 - about so i was i was like did i dream
01:52 - this and then i understood in the
01:54 - morning that actually it was it was true
01:56 - i was like wow and for the actual like
01:58 - the whole next day i was um sitting
02:00 - there just you know
02:03 - watching the the uploads just to make
02:05 - sure that we are we keep to be
02:08 - product of the day so yeah the friend
02:10 - who actually helped me with this uh his
02:12 - name is david diaz you might know him um
02:14 - he's the creator of the front-end
02:16 - checklist and now he's done the
02:18 - front-end checklist like performance
02:20 - checklist and i think he has um the
02:22 - design checklist and he's going to
02:24 - release some more uh so he's recently
02:26 - moved to toronto uh to kind of pursue
02:29 - his tech career further um yeah so we
02:33 - kind of met off uh off offline now uh
02:36 - which is nice he is an awesome guy so he
02:38 - suggests like he keeps suggesting me all
02:40 - of this stuff that i didn't know about
02:42 - um and yeah we ended up product like
02:45 - number one product of the day which i
02:47 - was surprised with but i was happy i i
02:50 - think what also helped is that you know
02:51 - when
02:52 - let's say you were developing a product
02:54 - like an app and you have to release it
02:56 - on protocol then you have to create like
02:58 - an article describing it like a video
03:01 - about it all those
03:04 - kind of
03:05 - assets that don't exist that you have to
03:08 - have for the launch but in our case
03:10 - because we've been running for i know
03:12 - two years now um we had all of that we
03:15 - had all the articles we had videos we
03:17 - had like a slack link everything they
03:19 - need so in that sense even instagram we
03:22 - like we're everywhere so it's been
03:25 - pretty easy to like set it up and just
03:27 - forget about it because it was like
03:28 - fully um
03:30 - customized yeah
03:32 - awesome well congratulations again on
03:34 - the success of uh the product launch uh
03:37 - i i guess we call it launch uh did you
03:40 - know that it wasn't even gonna go up
03:41 - there or did it just appear up there um
03:43 - so yeah we talked with david he's like
03:45 - how are you not here and he was the
03:47 - hunter so like he hunted the hundreds of
03:49 - code and i was the creator so we kind of
03:51 - like grouped together and just um
03:54 - he helped me put it there yeah pretty
03:56 - much
03:57 - what was it like for you know for you to
04:00 - be a top product i think free code camp
04:02 - uh was only the second place product
04:05 - when it was
04:06 - launched uh yeah looking back um that
04:09 - was a long time ago and that just
04:10 - totally took us out of left field we're
04:12 - like hey why are we getting all this
04:13 - additional traffic and there's like
04:15 - somebody's like you're on parkcon and
04:17 - we've already been up there for several
04:18 - hours so
04:20 - um
04:20 - but yeah like what was that like just um
04:23 - oh it's exciting um
04:25 - for me i'm still not sure why it
04:28 - happened the way it did because there
04:30 - were a lot of products like released in
04:31 - that day but also i think it's because
04:33 - we kind of like did the opposite of what
04:36 - people are supposed to do like you're
04:37 - supposed to release it during the
04:39 - weekday because every weekday there's
04:41 - like a newsletter that gets out the next
04:43 - day versus
04:45 - on the weekend there's no newsletter
04:47 - like there's no daily newsletter right
04:48 - so people optimize for a lot of things
04:50 - but they end up optimizing for the same
04:52 - things and they release those products
04:54 - on like you know using the best
04:55 - practices or whatever so i think
04:58 - one big part of it was that we released
05:00 - it randomly on a saturday that like not
05:03 - a lot of people would do
05:05 - especially the people who actually like
05:06 - planned their lunch
05:08 - so yeah yeah saturday like i can tell
05:11 - you anecdotally free code camp has about
05:14 - half the traffic it has
05:16 - on a weekday on saturday a lot of people
05:18 - choose to just kick it and take a day
05:20 - off i guess with 100 days of code
05:22 - they're not supposed to take a day off
05:24 - so maybe many of your existing uh people
05:27 - who are
05:27 - uh in the middle of the challenge
05:29 - decided to jump on and leave a
05:31 - remarkable product
05:33 - so did did this uh lead to a surge in
05:36 - new people um i believe it did yeah
05:39 - we've seen like new faces and new people
05:41 - on twitter especially because it's a
05:43 - different audience on product hunt i
05:45 - think um a bit of a different mindset
05:48 - there's some correlation with like
05:49 - people who are learning to code because
05:52 - there's so many different reasons you
05:53 - might be learning to code but prototype
05:55 - is more
05:56 - its focus is on the making of of things
05:58 - so eventually like you either graduate
06:01 - towards that or you find a stable job or
06:04 - you find a job like if you find a job at
06:05 - google for example like um and it's your
06:08 - first job you wouldn't just go on
06:09 - product hunt right away and try to make
06:11 - your own products until you get some
06:12 - experience so there's some kind of
06:14 - discord so that's why i think we got all
06:17 - those makers that aren't for the hunt to
06:19 - kind of take a look uh and
06:22 - discover what hundred days of code is
06:23 - and i've seen because i see the retweets
06:25 - of the hundred days of code bought i
06:27 - i've seen oh like this person joined and
06:29 - then what kind of congratulates them on
06:31 - like joining oh thank you for following
06:33 - me
06:34 - kind of stuff yeah
06:36 - yeah let's talk about the bot because
06:38 - the bot is really a remarkable success
06:41 - as far as twitter bots are concerned uh
06:44 - i understand that it recently crossed a
06:46 - thousand followers
06:49 - is is that correct
06:51 - i think we have 17 000 followers there
06:54 - uh for the twitter bot so it's pretty
06:56 - big uh it's bigger than like my account
06:58 - for example like my personal account i'm
07:00 - like whoa
07:01 - but because it brings more value to
07:03 - people is like
07:04 - 17 000 yeah i had no idea you had 17 000
07:08 - followers that's amazing i i was
07:10 - thinking like for a bot
07:12 - for a bot account that basically is just
07:14 - retweeting successful that's amazing man
07:16 - congratulations
07:18 - i think
07:19 - yeah go ahead sorry oh
07:22 - yeah go ahead
07:23 - oh yeah my thing was is um
07:26 - the popularity of the bot is because of
07:28 - the value it provides because
07:31 - it kind of connects with the community
07:33 - instantly kind of like
07:35 - compared with instagram which um i think
07:38 - three months ago or two months ago they
07:39 - rolled out finally
07:41 - an ability to follow a hashtag which is
07:44 - not doable on twitter so like it is
07:46 - doable in a way that you search for
07:48 - hashtag and then you kind of find out
07:49 - the details what instagram does actually
07:51 - and you can if you are on instagram
07:53 - subscribe to the hundred days of code
07:54 - hashtag because it's just people posting
07:56 - stuff they're working on and it's pretty
07:58 - cool and okay i think twitter bot kind
08:02 - of feels that niche on twitter
08:04 - where it's just impossible to to kind of
08:06 - connect to the community unless you like
08:07 - follow person by person but also how do
08:10 - you find out about the new people and
08:12 - things like this
08:13 - and also it's not a simple bot and thank
08:15 - you thanks uh i mean to amman for
08:17 - creating it
08:19 - uh you can find him at ammon himself um
08:22 - on twitter
08:23 - and what he's done i think he's done it
08:26 - in the very beginning of the creation of
08:28 - the countries of code like concept
08:31 - and without it i don't think we would
08:32 - have such a you know continuous um
08:36 - influx of new people coming in and kind
08:38 - of like the the community sustaining
08:40 - itself um
08:42 - so
08:44 - not just it like retweets people but
08:47 - also um
08:49 - it congratulates them on their success
08:51 - and it kind of like tries to um if
08:53 - they're unmotivated or if they're upset
08:56 - it listens kind of to those um
08:59 - searches i guess for for the hundreds of
09:01 - code hashtags and their sentiments so
09:03 - like if they use the word upset or set
09:04 - or something it will try to cheer them
09:07 - up with like a motivational quote and
09:08 - stuff so um and like always uh
09:12 - thanks for following things like this so
09:14 - it's kind of in a way it's kind of like
09:16 - a super simple
09:18 - um
09:19 - yeah you could say like it's a bot but
09:20 - it's not just a retweeter bots which
09:23 - there there are so many of them and
09:25 - i think even in those retweet bots
09:28 - sometimes there's value like i follow
09:30 - one for golang for example and it's
09:32 - pretty good like i find about the
09:34 - opinions of people who are just tweeting
09:35 - about going something they like found
09:37 - out or some like criticisms of it and
09:39 - it's always different
09:41 - which before i was kind of like looking
09:43 - at those accounts for example like there
09:45 - was one for like angularjs like if you
09:47 - were to do anything like js like
09:48 - angularjs bot would like retweet you uh
09:51 - and it's not like it's not the official
09:52 - one but it's just one of those that i
09:54 - remember i was like why would i ever
09:56 - like um
09:57 - follow it because it's kind of gonna
10:00 - put so many tweets that i don't care
10:01 - about in my in my feed but i think
10:03 - twitter has got
10:04 - really really good at
10:06 - kind of mixing up your um
10:08 - timeline in in a really cool way
10:11 - yeah
10:13 - yeah well the uh the project itself the
10:16 - the 100 days of code bought and we're
10:17 - going to get into 100 days of code for
10:19 - for those of you
10:21 - who are listening who aren't that
10:23 - familiar with the 100 days of code
10:25 - challenge
10:26 - it's a hashtag and there's a website and
10:29 - there's a twitter bot and all these
10:31 - different aspects of it and of course
10:33 - there's a giant community
10:36 - and
10:37 - um i'm just looking at the 100 days of
10:39 - code twitter bot actually right now and
10:42 - i'm gonna drop a link to this in the
10:44 - notes as well um
10:48 - take a look at that
10:49 - um
10:52 - how did the bot come about and whose
10:55 - idea was it and uh
10:58 - who like
10:59 - who took it and rolled with it and
11:01 - expanded it i i mean
11:03 - uh
11:04 - i see that amman mittal
11:06 - was he's been absolutely critical and
11:08 - i've talked to him about it a lot in the
11:10 - past yeah
11:12 - he is amazing um and i think that's um
11:15 - initially he had that idea of starting a
11:18 - bot uh i was kind of having some
11:19 - thoughts but it was like all very vague
11:21 - because i was trying to think of so many
11:23 - different things about the challenge to
11:25 - kind of like formulate it better to make
11:27 - it fit different um
11:29 - use cases uh but
11:32 - definitely emma i think was the one who
11:34 - like he got the idea he created it and
11:36 - it just like was presented to us as that
11:39 - thing like oh it's done already so big
11:41 - big thanks to him and he um also
11:45 - open sourced it and there's a lot of
11:46 - people who have helped improve it uh
11:49 - improve the bot
11:50 - along the way um
11:52 - as well as i think it's been
11:54 - that twitter bot is a part of recordcamp
11:57 - um github so it's kinda like it's a part
11:59 - of recodecamp
12:01 - so if you're interested in um kind of
12:04 - contributing to open source you can look
12:06 - at the code like at the code in this bot
12:08 - and maybe you'll you'll um come up with
12:11 - like a different feature for it and
12:12 - things like this uh yeah so
12:14 - yeah and i think i should mention
12:17 - probably for the people who might just
12:18 - hear about the hundreds of code that
12:20 - it's a challenge in which there are two
12:22 - main rules one rule is
12:24 - you code for one minimum
12:26 - minimum one hour a day for the next
12:28 - hundred days after you commit to it and
12:31 - the second rule is you um encourage at
12:33 - least two people on twitter every day
12:35 - that are also in the hundred days of
12:37 - code challenge you either reply to them
12:39 - or you like their tweet or you just
12:41 - communicate with them somehow and that
12:43 - kind of
12:44 - puts you into the loop of things into
12:46 - the community
12:48 - um
12:49 - but definitely another thing i wanted to
12:51 - mention is that i see a lot of
12:52 - misconceptions about um the holidays of
12:55 - code how it's evolved to be now versus
12:58 - what i wrote in the first article
13:00 - because in the first article i'm like
13:01 - i'm very um very specific because i was
13:04 - working at a job and i i wasn't super
13:07 - happy with the technology i was learning
13:08 - so i had to find a way to consistently
13:10 - somehow learn web technology so
13:14 - a days of code was kind of like an
13:15 - internal response to kind of like i have
13:17 - to make it
13:18 - like a public commitment somehow so we
13:21 - were sitting in a restaurant a famous
13:22 - story like i did it every time but uh
13:25 - yeah i was just sitting and talking like
13:26 - i was complaining to my wife like
13:28 - every day i make that decision and every
13:30 - day i fail like i just watch something
13:32 - instead of doing anything so
13:34 - um
13:35 - i suggested maybe i do it for three
13:37 - months and i publicly commit i tell
13:39 - everybody that i'm gonna do this she's
13:40 - like yeah okay but what about 100 days
13:43 - as opposed to like 90 days it's kind of
13:45 - like doesn't sound really well uh it
13:47 - doesn't sound really good um so after
13:49 - that i was born the 100 days of code and
13:54 - because of those limitations that i had
13:56 - in my personal story i kind of i put all
13:58 - those into the article like oh you can't
14:01 - miss a day you have to do one minimum
14:03 - one hour a day and things like this but
14:05 - since then so many new people kind of
14:08 - came into the
14:09 - community that
14:11 - i find that they read it and they're
14:13 - like oh but on saturdays i cannot do
14:16 - like i cannot do anything like it's my
14:17 - family for example or oh i can only
14:20 - afford like 30 minutes a day can i not
14:23 - do the challenge or oh i skipped two
14:25 - days can i continue or should i like
14:27 - restart it
14:29 - and to all of those people and to all of
14:31 - you listening
14:32 - it's very flexible it's up to you and
14:36 - you can definitely do anything you want
14:37 - with it you don't have to restart it
14:39 - every time you like make a mistake
14:42 - there's of course some ideal scenarios
14:44 - and there's also your personal rules
14:46 - like how you
14:47 - twist the the rules for yourself before
14:50 - you start
14:51 - um but i i suggest that if
14:54 - there's a certain limitation that you
14:56 - know of upfront you
14:59 - kind of write it into the rules of your
15:01 - challenge so let's say you don't do any
15:03 - work on saturday okay that'll be one of
15:05 - your rules but then once you commit to
15:07 - it you don't um
15:09 - you don't also sometimes take san diego
15:12 - for example just like uh for fun but um
15:15 - if it's something like you're traveling
15:17 - or you're sick or something you can
15:18 - always pause the challenge and come back
15:20 - to it and continue you don't have to
15:22 - like oh i had a cold for three days and
15:25 - i like lost my 90-day streak like why
15:28 - what really matters is that you keep
15:29 - coding every day
15:31 - that's the main thing it's like whatever
15:33 - gets you into that consistent um
15:36 - kind of um into that consistency i would
15:39 - say is what you need to do um and i also
15:43 - had another thought
15:45 - um
15:46 - oh yeah we've talked about today um
15:49 - about
15:50 - um
15:51 - certain you you call it the value of
15:53 - death uh but it's
15:56 - for everyone to kind of understand what
15:58 - i'm talking about is
16:00 - so you commit to 100 days and then you
16:02 - know during those hundred days like
16:03 - where is that moment where you kind of
16:06 - like start losing motivation you lose
16:08 - traction like what what can you do to
16:10 - prevent that from happening um and my
16:13 - recommendation i think is if you keep
16:16 - tweeting every day and tweeting your
16:18 - progress every day that'll keep you on
16:20 - track but as
16:21 - as long as soon as you um
16:24 - take a little pause of like three days
16:26 - four days it probably means you're gonna
16:29 - like stop doing it for for forever
16:32 - uh unless you come back to it later
16:35 - and that's the biggest i think because
16:37 - if you're constantly and also yeah being
16:39 - a part of the community so being in
16:42 - conversation with the people who are
16:43 - also doing the challenge like either on
16:45 - our slack which you can find in the
16:47 - hundred days of code dot com website
16:49 - slash connect
16:51 - um you can find all of the resources
16:53 - there um
16:55 - but as long as you keep yourself
16:56 - immersed into that
16:58 - you're going to do really well
17:00 - as soon as you break break off
17:02 - that's where it fails and i don't think
17:04 - there's like any difference between like
17:06 - 30 days or 90 days there's no some like
17:10 - like in certain other things for example
17:12 - if you were to immigrate to another
17:13 - country uh there's some statistics that
17:15 - like after three months
17:17 - that's where like the stress and and the
17:19 - depression hits of actually on
17:22 - all levels understanding or the the huge
17:24 - shift you've made right and it kind of
17:26 - hits you like a
17:28 - uh psycho bricks but yeah interestingly
17:31 - on that that anecdote uh of the the
17:34 - moving to another country you're someone
17:36 - who's lived in a lot of countries uh
17:38 - alex
17:39 - you're
17:40 - originally a russian national
17:42 - yep and you've lived in japan for a
17:45 - while and now you're living in toronto
17:48 - in canada
17:50 - yep
17:51 - would you liken
17:52 - moving to another country to that
17:55 - process of moving into a completely new
17:57 - field a really deep
17:59 - challenging
18:01 - subject domain like learning to code
18:03 - definitely
18:04 - i think there's a lot of similarities
18:06 - you're right
18:08 - and it's kind of like any major change
18:10 - is going to make you really really
18:11 - uncomfortable and what is nice about
18:14 - moving to another country is that you
18:16 - can't really go back like it's not as
18:18 - easy as just stop stopping coding for
18:21 - example and i think stopping gets harder
18:24 - the more you do it for example but still
18:26 - uh let's say i've moved here and i've
18:29 - paid for education or i've like i've
18:32 - lined up some work or whatever the
18:33 - situation might be uh it's really hard
18:35 - to just go back and like be like oh
18:38 - let's let this money kind of like go to
18:39 - to the toilet
18:41 - and things like this and also like the
18:42 - ticket price and everything so it kind
18:44 - of keeps you there uh but i think
18:45 - there's some
18:47 - really like if you can do it at some
18:49 - point in your life i think it's a good
18:52 - uh thing to do um because
18:55 - it kind of teaches you to overcome
18:58 - it's not just a gradual shift it's kind
19:00 - of like a quality shift in your life
19:02 - it's
19:03 - so much different that it's like it's
19:04 - hard to understand unless you try it uh
19:07 - same with coding i think um if you first
19:11 - were to come into the world of coding
19:12 - everything seems very foreign like all
19:15 - the terms are foreign
19:16 - you don't understand pretty much
19:18 - anything everybody seems like there's on
19:20 - such a high level that you will never
19:22 - catch up with them so and i think a lot
19:24 - of people who
19:27 - let's say they were in marketing or
19:28 - something and or they were in any other
19:31 - profession
19:32 - um and they hear about coding they get
19:34 - excited and reads a couple of vlogs and
19:35 - they decide okay i'm gonna learn to code
19:38 - uh what then can happen and that's
19:40 - really um sad is um they would do it for
19:44 - a month or they they would do it for two
19:46 - weeks and be like yeah okay that that's
19:49 - very interesting and then they kind of
19:50 - just like drop off and then like forget
19:52 - about that
19:53 - that's what i think 100 days of code can
19:56 - um fix for you if you are one of the
19:59 - beginners if you want to uh get into
20:01 - coding it kind of like it's a contract
20:03 - that you like sign with yourself to okay
20:06 - for this amount of time at least i'll
20:08 - give it like a fair shot and you don't
20:10 - expect let's say you're starting to
20:13 - learn french or you start to learn i
20:14 - don't know uh korean language
20:17 - you don't expect in a month that you
20:19 - understand everything or even like a
20:21 - little bit beyond the basics
20:23 - but people have that illusion with code
20:25 - sometimes they're like oh
20:27 - like i just don't get this like
20:29 - after two weeks like i've spent a month
20:30 - on this i still don't get it like people
20:32 - are
20:33 - spend like 20 years and they don't get
20:35 - some certain like parts of it right it's
20:38 - all and it's layered uh i i think it was
20:41 - one of your articles or one of your
20:43 - podcasts i was listening to it or maybe
20:45 - a
20:46 - code newbie uh interview and it was
20:50 - eye-opening to me at least at the time
20:52 - it was like a year ago or so um
20:55 - you were talking about how
20:57 - coding is so multi-layered and then
21:00 - it's almost equally um difficult to do
21:03 - something
21:04 - like systems programming like closer to
21:06 - the to the metal as it is to do
21:09 - something that's very abstract that's
21:11 - even though i it seems to beginners and
21:14 - like me it seemed that oh that stuff is
21:16 - like unlearnable i i should be like
21:20 - okay with doing at least this kind of
21:22 - stuff like some javascript but i should
21:24 - never go into that like it's even more
21:26 - difficult but i think it's not more
21:27 - difficult it's just differently
21:29 - difficult it's a different um kind of
21:32 - area it's kind of like if you were to
21:34 - learn um and study astronomy or
21:38 - versus like i don't know something like
21:40 - microscopic it's just different
21:41 - different
21:43 - areas of it
21:44 - so if you're a beginner and that's
21:47 - another um i think misconception people
21:49 - have is that you must learn a certain
21:52 - thing like you must learn web
21:53 - development and that'll be your career
21:55 - if you're not
21:57 - a cs major but no you can get into the
21:59 - field by learning web development
22:01 - because it's the fastest way and there's
22:02 - most resources available but you are
22:05 - allowed to like look around and do other
22:07 - stuff as well
22:08 - yeah and one of the things i tell people
22:11 - who are starting with freecodecamp for
22:13 - example is like this is a good
22:15 - place to start it's a good foundation
22:17 - learning how the web works learning how
22:19 - to build basic
22:21 - web apps that you can share with your
22:22 - friends easily they don't need to
22:23 - install anything they can just go to a
22:25 - url and check it out a good way to get
22:27 - feedback and learn some basics and then
22:30 - if you want you can
22:31 - go learn how to write your own compiler
22:33 - or your own operating system
22:35 - uh or all those classic kind of computer
22:37 - science
22:39 - projects that people would do
22:41 - if they were doing like a
22:43 - doctorate in computer science or
22:44 - something like that there's nothing
22:45 - stopping you
22:47 - but
22:48 - so
22:49 - 100 days of code one of the big
22:51 - objectives is just to
22:53 - to keep people motivated and it serves
22:55 - as a commitment device
22:57 - to prevent them from
23:00 - kind of
23:01 - fizzling out 30 days yeah going over the
23:03 - rails yeah
23:05 - right so it's a way to cash capture them
23:07 - when they're enthusiastic
23:09 - early on and they've got that initial
23:11 - burst of motivation
23:14 - and lock it in for the following 100
23:17 - days
23:19 - so i think yeah yep go ahead so how do
23:22 - you go about
23:24 - getting people to actually commit to
23:26 - this if somebody were
23:27 - listening right now and they wanted to
23:29 - they're they're just starting coding and
23:31 - they're really enthusiastic now but they
23:33 - know that as they have failing tests and
23:36 - error messages and all that enthusiasm
23:39 - a little bit right how can they commit
23:41 - to something like 100 days of code
23:44 - and force themselves
23:46 - to power through the setbacks
23:49 - all right so
23:51 - there's
23:52 - a couple of things first thing i've
23:53 - talked about already so i won't spend
23:55 - too much time on it it's the community
23:57 - it's very important then other ideas i
24:00 - have for for this kind of stuff is
24:02 - first you have to um
24:05 - immerse yourself into
24:07 - not only the successes of other people
24:09 - like if you follow this like coding
24:12 - stars on twitter only you
24:14 - kind of have a skewed perception of what
24:16 - coding is and also
24:18 - i would suggest find and read stories
24:21 - about people who who already learned to
24:23 - code and especially stories of people
24:26 - who have learned to code on their own
24:29 - because you'll see the common themes and
24:31 - you'll see that it's not just you like
24:33 - and you're not down and you're not like
24:36 - stupid and because these are all the
24:38 - fears that people are getting and like
24:40 - oh i've hit this error like i don't know
24:42 - what to do with that
24:44 - but usually with time at least i found
24:46 - this for myself um
24:49 - you even respo like you start responding
24:51 - to error messages differently like okay
24:53 - like this is what it says what can i do
24:55 - with it and you find out what it says
24:57 - usually it's your solution it's not as
24:59 - scary um so if something is failing is
25:02 - not it's like i guess 99 of coding is
25:06 - your tests failing your coding is
25:08 - failing like once it works it's done
25:11 - like there's no
25:12 - like unless it's like a build out of an
25:15 - app or um
25:16 - or a website you're just like building
25:18 - stuff out can like flashing it out
25:20 - uh you get that feeling of
25:23 - i don't know
25:25 - the the momentum but also they're part
25:28 - of like
25:28 - another
25:30 - more important part of coding is that
25:32 - once you've like built the skeleton you
25:33 - have to fill it in with like some meat
25:36 - and some
25:38 - content and this is usually where the
25:40 - problems happen and it's absolutely fine
25:42 - that they do um that's
25:45 - another
25:46 - point and the third kind of what hundred
25:49 - days of code can do for you or other
25:52 - things like this
25:53 - is elimination of decision making in
25:56 - terms of what do i do daily like your
25:59 - habits should
26:00 - never should a habit be a decision like
26:03 - it
26:04 - the beauty of
26:05 - committing to something for the longest
26:07 - like for a long period of time with
26:09 - having a plan is that you commit once
26:11 - you like will
26:14 - spend the day in frustration or maybe a
26:16 - week in frustration and learning about
26:18 - the sites you get excited and you make
26:20 - that commitment once but then it's not
26:23 - like every day you have to wake up and
26:25 - oh should they code today should they
26:27 - not make and this is me and the exercise
26:29 - like that's why i can't really
26:32 - exercise properly because i don't have a
26:34 - plan and i'm like always and i see that
26:36 - in myself right so i see i try to like
26:38 - be self aware of this
26:39 - but that's what fails for me is that for
26:41 - me
26:42 - it's every time i have to make that
26:44 - decision and every time i can
26:45 - rationalize myself out of it but if it's
26:47 - not something you rationalize you just
26:48 - sit down and like put your hands on the
26:50 - keyboard and you just start typing
26:52 - something that's kind of
26:54 - what it is
26:56 - um and
26:57 - i i think we talked about um before the
27:00 - call we talked about the book
27:01 - recommendations so i don't have it with
27:02 - me this i have a lot of books today that
27:05 - i'm going to show but um
27:07 - the
27:08 - ultimate one that i really like i've
27:10 - given to my boss to read uh it's the war
27:12 - of art
27:14 - by stephen pressfield and it's my
27:15 - absolute favorite book because i think
27:16 - there's so many and in it it talks about
27:19 - the struggle of a creative person to
27:22 - create art and in in our case the artist
27:25 - code in
27:26 - the case that's presented in the book he
27:29 - talks about writing but it also applies
27:31 - to everything else
27:32 - and it's it talks about the resistance
27:34 - and how
27:35 - um
27:37 - basically the common themes of um any
27:40 - struggle to produce something new
27:42 - so that's a book i would definitely
27:44 - recommend you read and it will give you
27:46 - a different perspective on like all
27:47 - those struggles that you feel like oh
27:49 - it's bad it's not bad it's just it's
27:51 - hard
27:53 - yeah and i can second that that's one of
27:55 - my favorite books uh it's you know
27:57 - procrastination seems like a pretty
27:59 - innocuous problem it's kind of almost a
28:01 - joke like oh i'm supposed to do my
28:03 - homework i'll just i'll just do it all
28:05 - at the last minute because then i have
28:07 - that time pressure it's all good you
28:09 - know but uh
28:10 - you know that's not particularly
28:12 - healthy but what's
28:14 - what's even worse is when you're
28:16 - depending on your own effort and there's
28:17 - no external pressure to tell you you
28:19 - have to get up and do this you really
28:22 - have to rely on habits
28:24 - and self-discipline and things like that
28:26 - to make sure things happen and
28:28 - you know in your current job there's a
28:31 - very good chance that your boss
28:34 - will be perfectly happy for you to stay
28:36 - focused on your work and what doing what
28:39 - it is you do rather than learning an
28:41 - entire new skill set and probably
28:42 - getting a job somewhere else or changing
28:44 - to a different department the company or
28:46 - something like that so if anything you
28:48 - have
28:49 - you know negative reinforcement to
28:50 - actually sit down and develop this new
28:53 - skill set
28:54 - um what are some of the other books
28:56 - you've got there i'm really curious to
28:58 - see oh yeah oh yeah
29:00 - so um
29:02 - which one should i start with so i'll
29:03 - start with the ones um i haven't like
29:06 - fully read i think i've read like 60 of
29:08 - each of those i'm planning to finish
29:09 - them it's make it stick it's a really
29:11 - good book uh taking like the latest
29:14 - discoveries in neuroscience and applying
29:16 - them to learning and one of those things
29:18 - is like that road memorization doesn't
29:20 - work and like are you watching that's
29:22 - what i'm taking from it is like
29:24 - re-watching tutorials doesn't really
29:26 - work or like relearning the same things
29:28 - over and over i would rather like go and
29:30 - try different resource um and things
29:32 - like this and like rereading especially
29:35 - i was
29:36 - when i was starting to learn to code i
29:38 - would copy everything like on codecademy
29:40 - for example i would copy like the whole
29:41 - things and like save them like my
29:43 - evernote so that i would like read it
29:45 - later but they've never read it and it
29:47 - was like just taking my time um so and
29:49 - mindset is a really really important
29:51 - book if you think that your
29:55 - like brain capacity or like intellectual
29:57 - capacity is limited it's not it's just
29:59 - it's a fluid concept and as you
30:03 - like strive more and you try harder on
30:06 - like working on complex things um your
30:09 - intellect will
30:11 - like
30:12 - go up pretty much uh and it's not uh
30:15 - that some people are smart and some
30:17 - people are stupid and that's what the
30:19 - book kind of changes it like
30:21 - i would definitely recommend that one um
30:24 - all right so now for my favorite ones
30:26 - okay
30:27 - um
30:28 - so willpower is a book i've read
30:32 - maybe
30:33 - five years ago or so and it was like
30:36 - when
30:37 - they said the author said even if it's
30:38 - visible so it's baum baumeister roy
30:42 - baumeister and john tierney
30:45 - um and they talk about willpower being
30:48 - a resource that you can deplete with the
30:50 - more you try to um
30:52 - exert it
30:54 - and there were some really cool
30:55 - anecdotes there about um
30:58 - what's his name
31:00 - uh with the magic i i forget his name oh
31:04 - david blaine exactly yeah
31:07 - like he can be insanely focused like
31:09 - certain weeks and have a meal plan and
31:12 - have a training plan and everything and
31:14 - then after he's done his like his trick
31:16 - or his performance for like next two
31:18 - weeks he's like just chilling at home
31:19 - and like eating chips and doing whatever
31:21 - he wants and i was so surprised by that
31:23 - i was like no i thought he was one of
31:25 - those people that like always always
31:27 - like kind like a machine
31:29 - um
31:30 - but yeah that was an important book but
31:33 - here to my favorite ones
31:35 - um this is i think this book is kind of
31:38 - to blame for the 100 days of code
31:41 - so there's a lot of ideas here so it's
31:43 - called the power of habit
31:44 - by charles duhigg
31:46 - i hope i don't um like i hope i
31:49 - pronounce his name correctly
31:51 - and you see i can make a lot of like
31:52 - notes as i read uh but some of the cool
31:57 - concepts in it um if i
32:02 - uh okay
32:06 - is
32:07 - that
32:08 - certain habits are very hard to break
32:11 - because they're part of a larger
32:14 - there's an illustration here
32:16 - like a larger
32:18 - frame
32:20 - which is the cue the routine and the
32:22 - reward so you can't really like there
32:24 - are neural pathways in your brain that
32:26 - you've trained with so many years of
32:27 - doing the same thing like let's say
32:28 - you're smoking but you're smoking
32:30 - because you have a cue to smoke
32:31 - sometimes you're like oh okay you got
32:33 - stress at work with some project
32:36 - that's your q for triggering of your
32:38 - habit of smoking for example and then
32:40 - once you smoked okay you you go to your
32:42 - time frame that's the reward you got
32:44 - like
32:45 - you got to chill a little bit
32:47 - and what they're saying is that you
32:48 - can't really
32:50 - stop the habit you can only
32:52 - replace it with something else so that
32:55 - cue like trigger will still happen all
32:56 - the time so you can choose something
32:59 - else to be your um stress reliever in
33:02 - this case for example you can be like oh
33:04 - just take a walk instead of
33:06 - smoking a cigarette when i'm stressed or
33:08 - have a cup of tea or something so that's
33:11 - one of them um
33:14 - i i tend to like ruin my books by
33:15 - writing in them um and i've read this a
33:17 - while ago so i can't really oh ai
33:20 - concept of a keystone habit also is
33:22 - amazing it's kind of like they've done a
33:24 - bunch of research and they found out
33:26 - about the people who have changed their
33:27 - life
33:28 - in many many many aspects
33:31 - um there was for all of them almost
33:33 - there was a
33:34 - keystone habit that started all of that
33:37 - so it's one habit that you start with
33:40 - and you do it every day no matter what
33:42 - and you see the effects of the positive
33:45 - effects and it kind of trains your brain
33:47 - to see other things in a similar
33:49 - framework so okay if i modify my
33:51 - behavior i'm actually getting positive
33:53 - results uh and that contradicts the
33:55 - mentality of uh instant beautification
33:58 - where oh it's nice okay it's good now
34:01 - i'm done i don't have to think about it
34:02 - and then the payoff comes with like
34:04 - negative consequences so in this case
34:06 - you kind of train your brain to delay
34:08 - gratification and the more you do it the
34:11 - better you get at everything so having
34:13 - that keystone habit you add more to it
34:16 - and i think the best example i have of
34:18 - that is uh leo babalta i hope i
34:21 - pronounced his name correctly as well uh
34:23 - of zenhabits.net so he was overweight he
34:26 - was smoking he was in debt and by at
34:30 - that time he was living in guam uh in in
34:32 - the us in like 2007 i think and so he
34:35 - started this blog where he would um talk
34:38 - about habits and how he was trying to
34:40 - and he made so many plans of how he
34:41 - would quit smoking and many of them
34:43 - failed but then
34:45 - and he's like now he says i wish i
34:47 - didn't choose the hardest habit to
34:49 - change but i think like it taught him a
34:51 - lot and that was his keystone habit and
34:54 - he started adding stuff and like getting
34:56 - rid of that getting rid of his car he's
34:58 - changed or sorry
35:00 - he's moved to san francisco he started
35:03 - writing books things like this so it's
35:06 - it's pretty nice
35:08 - um
35:10 - that's it for this book there's
35:13 - i have four more which i'm going to talk
35:15 - about
35:18 - this is a really nice book that was
35:20 - recommended to me uh by another person
35:22 - at free code camp so we don't only talk
35:24 - code then we talk about other stuff so
35:27 - slight edge and the author is jeff olsen
35:31 - so the book is really
35:33 - centered around one idea of how by
35:36 - changing something really slightly like
35:38 - one percent
35:39 - uh
35:40 - in whatever you're doing um will amass
35:44 - like critical effects over time
35:46 - and
35:48 - basically each chapter
35:49 - covers different aspects of your life
35:51 - like financial aspect exercise aspect
35:54 - all of this kind of stuff but the main
35:56 - idea is it's a very simple process of
36:00 - identifying one thing you're doing
36:02 - improving it
36:03 - by a minimum amount and then seeing
36:06 - those
36:07 - effects accumulate
36:10 - and it's i i think it's a nice book it's
36:12 - kind of like it's fast to read but it
36:14 - kind of like leaves an impression on you
36:16 - so this is
36:17 - as you can see one of the books that uh
36:19 - have had a big impact on me
36:22 - um and it was recommended by tim ferriss
36:24 - in his book before our work week
36:28 - so there are two books which i
36:30 - always say to people this is why i'm in
36:32 - canada like this is why i've made that
36:34 - change in my life it's a think and grow
36:37 - rich by by napoleon hill and the
36:39 - four-hour work week and they together
36:40 - kind of implanted me an idea like oh i
36:42 - could do business i could do stuff and
36:46 - it's not only limited to whatever i've
36:48 - been exposed to and so i was really
36:52 - confident that i can follow the
36:54 - recommendations of team ferris but in
36:56 - this case i think it was really really
36:58 - um
37:00 - powerful so the name of the book is the
37:03 - name of the house yeah it's the
37:05 - new psycho cybernetics it sounds really
37:08 - really weird but it's it's a nice book
37:11 - it's been written in the 60s i think and
37:13 - it's one of the first books that golfers
37:16 - used and like basketball
37:18 - trainers used to
37:20 - um kind of develop mental exercises for
37:24 - players so that they would play better
37:27 - um
37:28 - and then it's more like
37:30 - if you were to talk about like the power
37:32 - of thought and the power of your
37:33 - intention things like this but it's more
37:36 - of a
37:37 - practical approach to it i think uh in
37:39 - this book where um
37:42 - he kind of teaches you how to
37:45 - mentally imagine something before it
37:47 - happens or before like the results you
37:49 - want to achieve and that way your whole
37:52 - personality
37:53 - changes in response
37:56 - to
38:00 - what you're kind of envisioning so let's
38:02 - say you were a student and that's one of
38:04 - the examples there
38:05 - a student who would do really really bad
38:08 - at math
38:09 - and it's
38:10 - the reason is not he's like he's he's
38:12 - dumb it's just his self-image of he has
38:15 - a self-image of someone being bad at
38:17 - math because it was kind of like
38:20 - suggested to him over time by teachers
38:22 - by
38:23 - family whatever but you can definitely
38:26 - cancel that um
38:28 - influence
38:29 - by making
38:31 - kind of so
38:33 - they also teach you how to do it they
38:35 - teach you how to like form that
38:37 - self-image and i think it's if i'm
38:39 - thinking uh correctly it's the author
38:42 - was
38:43 - um
38:44 - a surgeon and like a pla
38:48 - what would it call like a plastic
38:49 - surgeon
38:51 - cosmetic surgery yeah
38:53 - so um and he was treating people who um
38:57 - were injured during the world war ii and
38:59 - also some other people who were just
39:01 - convinced that they were ugly or
39:03 - something was wrong with them like with
39:04 - their face and he noticed that
39:08 - some people after he's corrected there
39:10 - whatever it was like a nose for example
39:11 - oh i have it like too big of a nose he
39:13 - would correct it and some people would
39:15 - completely ignore that their appearance
39:18 - totally changed and they would still
39:20 - think oh i'm ugly like you made it worse
39:22 - and now i still have the huge nose so
39:24 - they
39:25 - and he started thinking like how could
39:27 - this be and some people would like scars
39:30 - would would be sometimes proud of those
39:32 - scars and they it would not affect their
39:34 - self-image and hence their uh also their
39:38 - behavior and and their being shy of
39:40 - other people sometimes
39:42 - as others that would just get scars
39:44 - during life and some people would get
39:46 - them at war for example and they were
39:47 - proud of them
39:51 - so
39:52 - he noticed that and he kind of went
39:54 - along
39:55 - developing that concept of self-image
39:57 - and definitely that's something that
39:59 - applies to code where you think oh i'm
40:01 - not like good at coding i'm not smart
40:03 - enough or i'm like i'm only good for um
40:07 - what do you call it like arts and and
40:09 - stuff like that and it's totally
40:10 - different like
40:12 - arts is as complex as coding and
40:16 - it's just some people
40:18 - have have been into situations or under
40:21 - influence of others that have been
40:23 - telling them oh like you're not good for
40:25 - this and they kind of accepted that so
40:28 - now they have this like mental block and
40:30 - this i think is this book is a good way
40:32 - to remove that block if you want to kind
40:34 - of go forward
40:36 - and two small books but
40:39 - they're all by the same person and also
40:41 - one of my favorites so i'll show them
40:43 - one by one this is called whatever you
40:45 - think think the opposite
40:47 - by paul arden
40:49 - and this actually influenced
40:53 - me to create do the opposite which is
40:55 - like
40:56 - it's still in development but it's gonna
40:58 - be like an umbrella project for hundred
41:00 - days of code hundreds of x and all the
41:02 - other projects i'm developing um to be a
41:05 - framework of thinking of how you can
41:07 - live your life differently from uh the
41:09 - like the common uh person would uh and
41:15 - this one is called it's not how good you
41:16 - are it's how good you want to be
41:19 - and it's also like you can see how these
41:21 - books are very like creative in the way
41:24 - they're done
41:25 - but it's not the shallow creativeness of
41:27 - like oh let's just make a small book
41:29 - with like a bit of text and just sell it
41:32 - so let's sell it because they are there
41:34 - are some books that look this similar
41:36 - way they're like small and they're like
41:37 - oh
41:39 - very motivational but um this one is
41:42 - actually like it's it's gold um and it
41:44 - teaches you to think differently
41:47 - pretty much and how you can
41:49 - [Music]
41:51 - like like with product hunt
41:53 - if i were to follow all of those best
41:55 - practices we would probably not get the
41:57 - product of the day and like a small
41:59 - example of that
42:01 - and sometimes doing things differently
42:03 - will be much easier and that's also
42:05 - explored i think in the four-hour work
42:07 - week by team ferris where
42:10 - if you are realistic you you'll you'll
42:12 - be on the same level of like play
42:15 - um playing field as a lot of other smart
42:18 - people who are also trying to be like
42:21 - trying to do something but then
42:23 - sometimes you have to create your own
42:25 - separate category of doing things so
42:28 - that you're always number one in it and
42:30 - you continue to and like you're not in
42:31 - no competition with anybody
42:34 - because being in a competition um
42:36 - competition kind of like
42:38 - it forces you to play the the game
42:42 - of like whatever the people are doing
42:44 - and you're kind of counteracting their
42:46 - actions sometimes and
42:48 - and when you're on your own you listen
42:50 - to yourself what do you want like if
42:52 - you're all your friends are learning to
42:54 - code and you just like kind of coming
42:56 - along um probably not the best
42:58 - motivation but if you are
43:00 - excited about coding and your friends
43:02 - are excited about coding as well
43:05 - but you're in this case you're listening
43:06 - to yourself and your own motivations
43:08 - that you're probably going to have a
43:10 - much higher chance of success as well as
43:12 - like learning technology oh everybody is
43:14 - learning reaps for example but you're
43:16 - really interested in i don't know
43:19 - golang or python
43:21 - and stopping yourself from doing that
43:24 - actually hinders you because that way
43:26 - you're like one of the people who are
43:28 - doing the same thing uh which also can
43:30 - be good but um yeah in my
43:32 - in my personal philosophy i think it's
43:34 - always better to listen to yourself in
43:36 - those cases so yeah that's that's it
43:38 - about yeah again like we're going on the
43:40 - rent
43:41 - yeah speaking of success uh talking
43:43 - about uh kind of
43:45 - finding a smaller pond that you can
43:48 - kind of be the big fish in so to speak
43:51 - um rather than just trying to jump
43:53 - straight into the big pond and try to be
43:55 - a big fish there
43:56 - um
43:57 - what are some success stories from
43:59 - within 100 days of code that come to
44:01 - mind
44:02 - uh because you have so many people
44:04 - participating in the challenge
44:06 - you right uh i think
44:08 - at this point more than a thousand
44:10 - people have attempted it um
44:13 - in fact i can check real quick
44:15 - uh if i go to the 100 days of code
44:18 - on uh your i think it's still under uh
44:23 - your own github account right
44:25 - yep loa slash 100 days of code and i can
44:28 - see that there have been 4 500 forks
44:32 - and if we assume that each of those
44:34 - forks is um somebody attempting the
44:37 - challenge because i believe forking it
44:38 - is one of the steps still is it still
44:40 - one of the steps
44:42 - yep
44:42 - so that means it's a good way to yeah
44:45 - keep your journal
44:47 - yeah so 4500 people have attempted this
44:50 - challenge
44:51 - hundreds and hundreds of people maybe
44:52 - thousands of people have have finished
44:55 - at least one rotation i know that now
44:57 - many people do a second rotation a third
45:00 - rotation
45:01 - what's a success story from within the
45:04 - community someone who went through a
45:06 - hundred days of code and had a positive
45:09 - outcome either while they were still in
45:10 - 100 days a country shortly after they
45:12 - finished it so one person i have in mind
45:15 - is um i'm gonna butcher his name but
45:18 - it's sick
45:21 - um
45:22 - and he is by the name of a signature
45:24 - twitter so it's s-y-k-n-a-p-s-e
45:30 - uh he
45:31 - lives in spain
45:33 - um and he had i think he's done
45:36 - hundreds of code twice by now but he's
45:38 - found a job and he's very happy at his
45:40 - job but he was a very um like during his
45:43 - time doing the hundreds of code he was
45:45 - one of the
45:46 - most active people on on the platform
45:49 - um
45:50 - also
45:51 - i think um victoria victoria
45:54 - uh
45:55 - berquist
45:57 - also um
45:58 - then uh we have ryan yost also who who
46:02 - was also working in the full-time job
46:05 - while learning and he's actually helped
46:07 - me with um my other project which kind
46:10 - of attempts to
46:11 - help people change other habits called
46:13 - hundred days of x
46:15 - so he's been helping me with the hundred
46:17 - days of journaling um and it's kind of
46:19 - the same concept but you journal every
46:21 - day so um we've kind of talked a lot
46:24 - with them uh and i also like um to
46:28 - converse with um
46:30 - joe previte or pravitay yeah i'm
46:33 - terrible at names um yeah i think uh i'm
46:36 - not sure actually i talked to him the
46:37 - other day though
46:38 - right i know actually all these people
46:40 - you're mentioning i know them because
46:42 - they they make themselves known they're
46:44 - all over twitter they're all they're
46:46 - doing things you know
46:48 - and
46:49 - these are people who
46:50 - could just as easily be sitting on a
46:52 - couch playing video games right exactly
46:54 - no they're out there
46:56 - not only learning the code but inspiring
46:58 - tons of people that learn to code along
47:00 - oh yeah
47:01 - and i think one of the good ways you can
47:03 - help others learn is just by sharing
47:05 - your journey and sharing your like
47:07 - day-to-day experiences what are you
47:09 - working on what which companies you're
47:10 - applying to not maybe not by name but
47:12 - that you're applying to jobs that you're
47:14 - like just sharing your journey and it
47:16 - always has a response in people because
47:19 - they are
47:20 - interested because they either excited
47:23 - for you and also
47:25 - they want to explore what they can do um
47:27 - let me see if i can find someone else so
47:29 - obviously emman uh mitel uh at ml
47:32 - himself who has been doing the hundreds
47:34 - of code who's also um
47:36 - created the bot for us
47:39 - um
47:39 - then i have a make a hankovic
47:42 - um from germany she's been helping a lot
47:45 - and also i forget to mention that um in
47:47 - what happened in this year is that we've
47:49 - rolled um not rolled out but we've added
47:52 - um
47:53 - different languages on the repo so now
47:57 - we are i think at 12 different languages
48:00 - the repo has been translated to
48:02 - and if you are
48:04 - on the repo you find one of the
48:06 - languages you speak is missing so you
48:08 - can consider adding it and it will be a
48:09 - great contribution to open source uh on
48:12 - github because
48:14 - anybody can then use it um and i was
48:16 - surprised with how many people actually
48:18 - helped us
48:20 - kind of
48:20 - create
48:23 - those translations
48:25 - one of the most surprising things was i
48:27 - was trying to find someone to translate
48:29 - it to japanese
48:31 - because i've been learning a little bit
48:33 - of japanese way back and for me it's
48:36 - like an i don't know in an exciting
48:37 - language and actually a company called
48:40 - pro gate um from japan reached out to me
48:44 - with with the pull request pretty much
48:46 - of everything translated to japanese and
48:48 - i was like yes and they are um pretty
48:51 - much like
48:52 - treehouse where they have courses for
48:54 - every like programming language i think
48:57 - um
48:58 - but it's all in japanese so um if you
49:01 - know japanese you can use that resource
49:03 - they seem to be very
49:04 - a very interesting um
49:07 - um
49:08 - kind of website to learn from also
49:10 - i definitely want to mention uh pi bytes
49:14 - which are
49:15 - a it's like a website where you can
49:17 - learn python in in bytes so pi bytes um
49:21 - i think
49:22 - bob is one of um
49:24 - i'm gonna butcher his last name uh i
49:26 - think belgium was i'm just gonna find it
49:28 - just by my
49:31 - memory doesn't serve me too well
49:33 - um
49:34 - let me find
49:37 - so i found five bytes but uh let me see
49:39 - yeah while you're looking at that so
49:40 - they
49:42 - oh i was just gonna encourage everybody
49:43 - to check out like i included a link
49:46 - um in the description
49:48 - to the live tweets
49:50 - about um 100 days of code using the 100
49:53 - days of code
49:54 - first of all if you take a look at that
49:56 - you'll notice that there are probably i
49:58 - don't know 30 40 50 tweets an hour
50:02 - using this hashtag it's a very
50:04 - very popular
50:05 - hashtag
50:07 - and they're in all kinds of different
50:09 - world languages
50:11 - and people are at all different stages
50:14 - in the journey
50:15 - day 47
50:17 - day 15 day 8
50:19 - day 66 so people are
50:23 - all kind of going through this
50:25 - at different rates and they're they're
50:27 - all at different points in their their
50:28 - journey
50:29 - but
50:30 - they're doing it together and other
50:32 - people are jumping on and replying and
50:34 - encouraging them
50:35 - so
50:36 - it's it's really quite profound the
50:39 - notion of people cycling through
50:40 - this
50:43 - repeatedly
50:45 - motivating forward
50:48 - all right go another
50:49 - another cool way to
50:52 - find out some of the
50:55 - stories of people is if you go to
50:56 - product hunt for hundreds of code some
50:59 - um community members have actually
51:01 - posted their like reviews of the product
51:03 - where they told their stories of how um
51:06 - and just i think it's product hunt slash
51:08 - post slash 100
51:10 - days of code all in like um what is it
51:13 - called um kebab case
51:15 - i think yeah
51:20 - uh these are dashes instead of spaces
51:22 - i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and add
51:24 - that link to the uh
51:26 - to the description real quick
51:28 - so people can read some of those there
51:31 - yeah
51:33 - so um that doesn't affect the the the
51:36 - fact that the stream's going on at the
51:37 - moment
51:38 - um
51:39 - coming back um to pie bites i found uh
51:42 - the creators uh is
51:44 - bob belder boss is one of the creators
51:47 - and i think he's working with julian
51:48 - seclara on this and
51:51 - they've created like a course for
51:53 - hundreds of code um like where you can
51:56 - learn things so as you know highlights
51:58 - of code doesn't have like a certain like
52:00 - curriculum it has a free code camp
52:02 - curriculum as i like but it doesn't have
52:04 - content so people often ask me like what
52:07 - should i do for my 100 days of code like
52:08 - is there a plan i'm like yeah just go to
52:10 - free code camp and that's the plan um
52:12 - but otherwise you're definitely
52:14 - encouraged to use any resources that you
52:16 - can and
52:17 - if you're learning a new technology
52:19 - definitely you can consider it as a part
52:21 - of the challenge that's another question
52:23 - i remember that a lot of people are
52:24 - asking uh but yeah so pi bytes their
52:27 - course i think the first 10
52:30 - pi bytes are free and then if you decide
52:33 - it's like a paid course where you can
52:34 - learn python which is amazing and
52:36 - that'll be like also your
52:38 - countries of code journey
52:40 - um
52:42 - if you're interested in python
52:43 - specifically
52:44 - um
52:45 - so yeah that's one one of the things i
52:47 - wanted to mention for sure
52:50 - um
52:51 - there was something else
52:53 - well how about we talk about uh the
52:56 - slack chat so you've mostly been based
52:58 - on twitter and that's still the main hub
53:01 - for 100 days of code design right
53:03 - you also have a slack
53:05 - uh channel and you have a discord
53:07 - channel right
53:08 - yeah all of those you can find on on the
53:11 - main website the hyundais of code.com
53:14 - connect uh but on slack we now have
53:17 - around 3000 people i think let me even i
53:20 - can check
53:22 - just a sec
53:26 - yeah and how are people interacting on
53:30 - the slack like it do you have regulars
53:33 - or do people jump in when they have a
53:36 - question
53:37 - uh what what are the main things you
53:40 - find people discussing on there so um
53:42 - they're just sometimes people like
53:44 - introduce themselves and uh
53:46 - talk about different things random
53:47 - things like the questions that may have
53:49 - and we have pretty much a channel within
53:51 - our slack we have a channel for
53:53 - everything you might need like if you're
53:54 - stuck on on a code problem there's like
53:56 - ask for help there's ask for feedback
53:59 - where you've completed something there's
54:01 - um let me just check um connect by tech
54:04 - where people can connect by certain
54:05 - technology that you're using um
54:08 - there's get motivated channel where
54:09 - people just like put motivational stuff
54:11 - in and share resources is a good one uh
54:13 - so when you join uh i think it kind of
54:16 - um adds you to all of those channels by
54:18 - default and then you can kind of like
54:20 - pick and choose whichever ones um else
54:22 - you want but i would say it's a good
54:25 - resource where you need a certain
54:26 - question answered as opposed to twitter
54:28 - sometimes it's kind of like uh you've
54:30 - tweeted something somebody responded to
54:32 - it and then it's lost forever in the
54:33 - story timeline um so that's why we
54:36 - needed slack where
54:37 - conversations are more permanent they're
54:39 - not
54:40 - super permanent because it's a free
54:41 - slack we're not paying for it so only
54:43 - the 10 000 messages i think are saved
54:46 - which is okay like i don't intend to
54:48 - like run the biggest archive on on the
54:50 - internet but it doesn't help just just
54:53 - out of curiosity discord we started
54:55 - using that a lot more we still use
54:56 - gitter
54:57 - but like i created a discord
54:59 - specifically for the top
55:02 - contributors
55:04 - right meeting top contributors and one
55:06 - of the appeals of discord other than the
55:08 - fact that it's just a really really well
55:10 - built app it's really fast um
55:14 - is that there's no you know it's not
55:15 - like a free tier where you have messages
55:18 - different so i guess i'm curious like
55:20 - uh
55:22 - what do you think the benefits of slack
55:24 - are versus right right anybody who wants
55:26 - to start up a community which one would
55:28 - you recommend they use at this point
55:30 - um if you were to start a community use
55:32 - discord if you were uh in our case i
55:35 - don't want like the first 3 000 people
55:37 - that have registered on slack to just go
55:39 - off and like download another app
55:41 - because the cost of switching is too
55:43 - high and nobody will will do it i think
55:47 - well on our discord channel what i have
55:49 - to do is to create those
55:50 - like sub channels in a more like in a
55:53 - better way and then we gradually could i
55:55 - think move over there but i don't know
55:58 - like personally i don't know how to make
56:00 - that efficient and how to like avoid
56:02 - duplication of content and how to avoid
56:04 - all of that inertia that's built up uh
56:07 - and for me like if i were to download
56:09 - another app or use it in the browser
56:11 - it's kind of like just another app i
56:12 - have to run where for work i'm running
56:14 - slack so that's kind of that was the
56:16 - logic behind it yeah it's really hard to
56:19 - choose one of those platforms because
56:21 - there's always
56:23 - i really like also
56:24 - spectrum and that was an interesting one
56:27 - that recently came about from i think
56:29 - max toyber the the guy who is behind
56:32 - styled components
56:33 - i hope i got that correctly everything
56:36 - of those connections um
56:38 - that's an interesting one because it's
56:40 - more like kind of like the discuss kind
56:42 - of like the free code camp forum where
56:43 - everybody can
56:45 - everything is a link pretty much you
56:47 - know and that's what missing in slack is
56:50 - that any perfectly answered question is
56:54 - kind of lost forever in this
56:58 - slack world
57:01 - that was definitely a big motivation for
57:03 - us to focus our efforts more on the
57:04 - forum because
57:06 - you answer a question one time and that
57:09 - question shows up in the search results
57:11 - and it's indexed at google
57:13 - and it just reduces the redundancy uh
57:17 - that's it
57:18 - a lot of people
57:19 - want to have a
57:21 - unique answer to their specific question
57:23 - and it feels really good to have
57:24 - somebody giving you exactly
57:27 - what exactly what you're asking as
57:28 - opposed to your question is kind of
57:30 - similar to this
57:32 - which the free cocaine forum if you
57:33 - start to ask questions it'll steer you
57:35 - toward questions that things are similar
57:37 - but
57:38 - um yeah
57:40 - definitely like the the real-time nature
57:42 - of chat there's like a kind of a hype
57:45 - and uh just a lot of buzz
57:48 - around um
57:49 - having an instantaneous response from
57:51 - somebody right um and i think we should
57:54 - kind of we should try to dissuade
57:56 - ourselves from doing that because it
57:58 - builds
57:59 - bad habits
58:00 - of
58:01 - again it's instant gratification like i
58:03 - don't need to
58:06 - and that's why even on twitter or an
58:07 - email
58:08 - don't expect someone to respond to you
58:10 - right away they will respond in their
58:12 - own time where they
58:13 - they've scheduled it and and i think in
58:16 - some ways technology is kind of like
58:17 - ruining us in that sense where like if
58:20 - i'm not getting an answer in like one
58:22 - hour
58:23 - does that person hate me or like do they
58:25 - have something against me like no they
58:26 - just living their life um and same with
58:29 - those instant instant messages and i
58:31 - think
58:33 - if you are if you find yourself i think
58:35 - you're doing it really well but i'm
58:36 - speaking to the audience if you find
58:38 - yourself um
58:41 - being asked or if somebody asks you the
58:43 - same question over and over like let's
58:45 - say you go to a free go cam meetup at
58:46 - yours in your city and somebody keeps
58:49 - asking you the same question
58:51 - it may be a good idea to put that answer
58:54 - into a form of a blog post and have like
58:57 - some sort of like your own domain slash
58:59 - that blog post where you can kind of
59:02 - send people to and if they have more
59:04 - questions you can like ask the specific
59:06 - details or like answer the specific
59:07 - details about their their question but
59:09 - in this sense also what you get is
59:12 - visibility of this answer for everybody
59:14 - on the internet and that can help you
59:16 - and that can help them people who don't
59:19 - have access to you in particular for
59:21 - example
59:22 - um like i saw your article yesterday
59:25 - about them
59:27 - deleting all of the old tweets and i was
59:30 - like this is probably a question that
59:31 - gets asked a lot i'm like this is a good
59:32 - idea to answer that
59:34 - yeah
59:35 - uh
59:36 - so let's briefly talk about the future
59:39 - of 100 days of code what are some
59:41 - aspects of 100 days of code that you're
59:44 - really excited about and what do you
59:46 - have in store for
59:48 - the remainder of 2018
59:51 - um i don't have anything particular in
59:54 - store but i think we could definitely
59:57 - add some um
59:59 - like learning paths for people that are
60:01 - like you know you're just a beginner
60:03 - you're you're doing this or you already
60:05 - um on a different track or you want to
60:07 - learn python for this kind of stuff so
60:09 - for us to have some sort of a way to
60:12 - give them some content like oh this is
60:13 - what you can do um that they don't have
60:15 - to search for that would be a good idea
60:18 - adding more languages would be another
60:20 - um and i have some other ideas as well
60:24 - on kind of like wrapping it all around
60:26 - that do the opposite uh platform where
60:28 - i'm thinking of starting a podcast
60:30 - ideally where one of the topics would be
60:32 - hundred days of code and where we can
60:34 - explore like learning to code uh in more
60:37 - depth um
60:39 - that's kind of like on my
60:40 - list of things that i would like to do i
60:42 - have an idea for you just take this with
60:45 - a grain of salt because
60:46 - um it it would involve work on your part
60:49 - would not work on mine
60:51 - but uh um
60:55 - i it seems human psychology
60:58 - and uh motivation
61:00 - and habit formation and those different
61:03 - aspects of applied psychology
61:06 - you could perhaps consider creating a
61:08 - book club because i know a lot of people
61:10 - who are interested in willpower
61:12 - and how to inculcate healthy habits and
61:14 - things like that and a lot of it is
61:16 - domain
61:17 - independent whether you're trying to
61:19 - learn to code
61:20 - whether you're trying to
61:22 - whether you're trying to write more and
61:24 - and critical things
61:26 - um or meditate more or whatever it is
61:29 - sleep more
61:30 - whatever
61:31 - you need to do to make your life
61:34 - uh better whether that's career based or
61:36 - lifestyle based um
61:39 - it seems like that reading you could
61:41 - build a reading list and then you could
61:43 - have kind of a book club like
61:45 - in october we're gonna be talking about
61:47 - this book and november we're gonna be
61:49 - talking about this book so everybody get
61:50 - this book and read it in advance of that
61:52 - that's kind of like book clubs are as
61:54 - old as books are
61:55 - uh yeah for sure
61:57 - um i haven't been considering it but if
62:00 - i can um
62:02 - send a link somehow somehow here i'll
62:05 - send it to you in this chat that i'm
62:07 - seeing
62:08 - so this is uh my
62:10 - kinda like a little
62:12 - newsletter that i'm sending out um i've
62:15 - only sent it a couple of times for now
62:17 - but this is where i'm gonna be building
62:18 - that i think it's a good idea to kind of
62:20 - tie it with your idea of reading like
62:21 - reading club where i would announce the
62:24 - things we're reading um in in that one
62:28 - great well i'm going to go ahead and
62:29 - share that um as well
62:32 - and thank you everybody wants to sign up
62:33 - with that i just signed up myself
62:36 - um now the pressure
62:39 - yeah actually right
62:42 - i sign up to a ton
62:45 - oh and somebody in the chat just said
62:46 - they love the book club idea
62:48 - i sign up to a ton
62:50 - of email newsletters it's a great way to
62:53 - to i mean the information just comes to
62:55 - you
62:56 - and uh usually if i don't have time i
62:58 - just archive it you know it's not a big
63:00 - deal right
63:01 - yeah i i basically treat my inbox
63:04 - a lot of people ask me how i stay up on
63:06 - all all the different things because i
63:08 - get emails from jason kalinakis at this
63:11 - week in startups
63:13 - he has like inside.com and they have
63:16 - some great newsletters
63:17 - um you know
63:19 - uh bruce schneiner has his cryptogram
63:23 - that comes out every month and that
63:24 - talks about security related stuff
63:27 - it's so convenient to just sign up for
63:29 - these people's uh newsletters and have
63:31 - the great information come directly to
63:33 - you right uh and and of course i have my
63:35 - own email blast that goes out to
63:37 - everybody who uh signs up for free code
63:39 - camp
63:40 - and i'm going to start sending that out
63:42 - again soon we're working on some
63:43 - infrastructure yeah i love that one yeah
63:46 - but yeah i think that that's really like
63:48 - an under
63:49 - utilized
63:51 - uh medium for reaching out to people is
63:53 - just
63:54 - sending emails uh and i would encourage
63:57 - everybody who's watching this if you're
63:59 - interested in building your reputation
64:02 - uh as a developer
64:03 - you know blogging podcasting these are
64:06 - great ways to do it and then you can
64:07 - also publicize your blogs in your
64:09 - podcast by having an email list uh even
64:13 - if there were only like 100 people on
64:14 - that email list
64:16 - and most of them are your relatives and
64:18 - friends who signed up
64:20 - that's great yeah because it's a low
64:22 - friction way for you to quickly kind of
64:24 - share stuff and it's way more rich than
64:26 - twitter if you tweet stuff out people
64:28 - are going to miss it yeah if you're on
64:30 - facebook
64:31 - uh well i for one don't even really use
64:33 - facebook anymore unless i absolutely
64:35 - have to and i think a lot of people
64:36 - exactly by the way they just downgraded
64:38 - all their unit numbers in europe uh a
64:40 - lot of people in europe have stopped
64:42 - using facebook too but um yeah like
64:45 - uh sorry for the little aggression i
64:47 - don't mean to do no no
64:48 - it's really interesting to me
64:50 - yeah i would say um
64:54 - know having a regular mailing list would
64:56 - be
64:56 - uh great for other people and
64:59 - i'm signed up for your email alex and
65:01 - i'm
65:02 - extremely jazzed to see what you send
65:04 - out and if you have a book club
65:06 - i happen to spend a tremendous time a
65:09 - tremendous amount of time running
65:11 - and i listen to books while i run
65:13 - uh i probably listen to 20 or 30 hours
65:16 - of audio content a week like between all
65:18 - the different podcasts and all the
65:19 - audiobooks i listen to
65:21 - so you know i'd be i'd be interested
65:23 - yeah
65:24 - audiobooks have been i think the number
65:27 - one discovery for me this year like i've
65:29 - all since i've started working i've
65:31 - always had trouble of like actually
65:32 - reading books as opposed to my time at
65:35 - like at college where i had so much time
65:37 - uh and audiobooks kind of filled that
65:39 - where you like you have to walk for 500
65:41 - meters you have to hop on a bus and you
65:43 - have to you know walk in a kilometer and
65:46 - then um you
65:48 - ride by train things like this you can
65:50 - always listen to your audiobook so this
65:52 - year has been like insane in terms of
65:54 - like me getting through books and uh
65:56 - fiction as well like i'm i've had the
65:59 - longest time i've had a lot of trouble
66:00 - reading fiction books
66:02 - and i want to like sci-fi i love that
66:04 - i've recently
66:05 - read or like listened to dune and i was
66:08 - like wow now i understand this is
66:11 - amazing um so yeah and also one little
66:14 - tip that i got from buzz boss who's um
66:18 - our canadian super super and popular
66:21 - developer oh yeah one of my heroes yeah
66:23 - he's amazing um
66:25 - he's actually teaching at um like he
66:28 - used to teach at one of the boot camps
66:30 - here
66:31 - but unfortunately now no access we can
66:33 - just
66:34 - you know get his courses but um he is
66:37 - recommended on his podcast syntax fm by
66:40 - the way amazing podcast about web
66:42 - development um
66:44 - if you are going through a course or
66:46 - watching a video try to watch it on 1.5
66:49 - x or 2x speed
66:51 - because you will not lose any content
66:54 - like i'm watching all the udemy courses
66:56 - i'm i'm taking
66:57 - at 2xp and i don't miss anything like i
67:01 - as a non-native english speaker i
67:04 - thought i would i'll be like oh this is
67:05 - too fast for me but no actually and
67:08 - even when i'm watching on normal speed
67:11 - you would assume that i can code and
67:14 - listen at the same time but i can't so
67:15 - there's no really no value for me to
67:18 - like watch it at this moment like slow
67:20 - speed so that's one of the super tricks
67:22 - and you can double the amount of content
67:25 - you like get through and understand and
67:27 - like um digest um
67:30 - with that just little trick that's
67:33 - amazing yeah yeah and i'll just chime in
67:35 - as well i listen to everything on double
67:37 - speed as well and i found it
67:39 - dramatically i mean it cuts the amount
67:40 - of time you have to spend listening in
67:41 - half you have to listen a little harder
67:44 - so it keeps you more engaged
67:47 - and
67:48 - just like you said i never attempt to
67:50 - listen to a podcast or listen to an
67:51 - audiobook while i'm doing something else
67:53 - that uses my brain if i'm trying to code
67:56 - or i'm trying to write an article or
67:57 - something it's a fool's errand
67:59 - to multitask in that way i think
68:02 - you know
68:03 - you can multitask in the sense that you
68:05 - can run and listen to a podcast at the
68:07 - same time but you can't like write and
68:09 - talk at the same time or listen to
68:11 - somebody else and talk at the same time
68:12 - so the human brain just seems to be well
68:15 - disposed to doing kind of unthinking
68:18 - activity and thinking
68:19 - in parallel but yeah two thinking
68:21 - activities at the same time exactly i've
68:24 - recently found out
68:26 - especially by having those
68:28 - is that i can do any work around the
68:30 - house like i can vacuum clean the
68:32 - apartment while listening to an
68:33 - audiobook or sometimes i do the dishes
68:36 - and usually it's like it takes a bit
68:38 - more time than i would want to but if
68:40 - you're listening to an audio book it's
68:41 - kind of like the time you've already won
68:44 - and you kind of like just go ahead with
68:46 - it so it's also been like a great um
68:49 - kind of influx of more time that i can
68:51 - spend on it so yeah definitely yeah and
68:53 - we're in a golden asia podcast
68:56 - i think that this is like the amount of
68:58 - incredible
69:00 - content that comes out in podcast form
69:02 - every week is just
69:04 - too much you mentioned
69:06 - fm is great i listened to that i
69:08 - listened to change log i listen to
69:09 - software engineering daily code newbie
69:12 - learn to code with me podcast
69:14 - uh i don't want to leave anybody else's
69:16 - podcast but you know like indie hackers
69:19 - um and then of course like all the
69:22 - podcasts from prominent technologists
69:25 - and uh you know tech news uh kara
69:28 - swisher rico decode is great um
69:31 - there's no shortage of content you can
69:34 - you can run for like 10 hours a week 20
69:36 - hours a week and and learn so much just
69:39 - with your headphones on
69:40 - new york times washington post like all
69:42 - the major publications have great
69:45 - podcast versions so
69:46 - i apologize for the protracted pitch but
69:50 - if you're not listening to podcasts yet
69:52 - you absolutely should
69:54 - start listening immediately and and you
69:56 - should check out the free code cam
69:57 - podcast for sure
70:00 - we're we're going to definitely continue
70:02 - to ramp up we're publishing one podcast
70:05 - every one day i'd like to start
70:06 - publishing every wednesday as well
70:09 - um so have at least two episodes a week
70:11 - for you all um and it's going to cover a
70:14 - lot like stuff that doesn't require a
70:16 - lot of visual aid so less
70:18 - you know how to debug this you know
70:21 - snippet of javascript and more
70:23 - right um how you know how do i stay
70:25 - motivated while i'm learning
70:27 - or
70:28 - you know how do i
70:29 - convince my boss that this technology
70:31 - decision is better than this one um
70:34 - different situations like this
70:37 - that's interesting i have just one
70:39 - question for you it's kind of like
70:40 - multi-layered question could you tell us
70:42 - more about your running like do you run
70:45 - every day what time of day do you run
70:47 - how like what's the distance and how do
70:49 - you do it why you do it it's really
70:51 - interesting to me yeah i so i am
70:53 - a creature of havoc i've read the
70:55 - charles duhigg book i've read a lot of
70:57 - books about habit formation willpower
71:00 - and uh
71:01 - so every day i wake up with my kids wake
71:04 - me up basically they start crying come
71:06 - and get me out of bed
71:07 - so uh i grab my little infants
71:10 - uh i grab one under each arm walk them
71:13 - downstairs get them breakfast change
71:14 - their diaper or change my son's diet for
71:16 - my daughter's potty train now um and
71:18 - then
71:19 - uh after everybody's ready and everybody
71:21 - eats breakfast i've been skipping
71:23 - breakfast i basically am doing what's
71:24 - called intermittent fasting where i
71:26 - don't eat 16 hours a day and i've been
71:28 - losing about a pound every two weeks as
71:30 - a result of this so nice and doing it
71:32 - like ten or i don't know why it works
71:34 - but it seems to work i eat you know just
71:36 - whatever i'm not really doing anything
71:38 - diet wise but i'm not eating breakfast
71:40 - anymore and i'm not eating snacks after
71:41 - dinner so then i just
71:46 - just uh after i get the
71:49 - uh school and i go directly to the ymca
71:51 - and i just run laps around that for
71:53 - about an hour and then
71:54 - um i come home at work
71:57 - and then uh after my kids go to sleep
72:00 - sometimes i'll go there's a lake nearby
72:01 - and i just run around the lake
72:03 - um so you know anywhere between
72:07 - uh
72:08 - five and
72:09 - ten hours a week spent running
72:11 - wow
72:13 - i'll run about 10k
72:16 - you've probably read this book but if
72:18 - you haven't um
72:20 - you know haruki murakami is um one of
72:22 - the japanese authors so he has a book
72:24 - and he's an avid runner as well has a
72:26 - book called what i'm talking about when
72:28 - i'm talking about running or something
72:29 - like that or what i talk about when i
72:31 - talk about running amazing and i think
72:34 - check that out
72:35 - that's the second time this week that
72:36 - somebody recommended it to me so wow
72:38 - yeah
72:40 - yeah
72:42 - all right well hey uh i'm serious even
72:45 - if you don't create that book club
72:46 - that list of books put that together
72:48 - into an article and i'll include that uh
72:51 - because you know we could just put it on
72:53 - the headline like you know the 100 days
72:56 - of code
72:57 - how the creator of 100 days of code
73:00 - sticks with habits
73:01 - you know his reading list
73:03 - something like that and it sounds like
73:05 - you're discovering new books all the
73:06 - time that that
73:08 - kind of cover these different topics but
73:10 - you know like the zen in the art of
73:12 - motorcycle maintenance for the 2018
73:15 - uh
73:16 - you know
73:17 - people living in that year
73:20 - that kind of list i think would be super
73:22 - helpful
73:23 - and um
73:24 - you know like that kind of category was
73:27 - often called like self-help or something
73:29 - like that but i just want to make it
73:30 - clear like these aren't like
73:32 - motivational business books
73:34 - uh the way that like
73:36 - you know i think
73:37 - those kind of books get kind of a bad
73:40 - rap
73:40 - a lot of these are applied psychology
73:42 - type books um yes some of them could
73:45 - probably be summarized in a couple pages
73:47 - of bullet points
73:48 - but
73:49 - um i think that there's a lot of value
73:51 - in reading them and i've read a lot of
73:52 - them
73:53 - and uh i
73:55 - i definitely think it's worth you know
73:57 - paying 10 15 bucks to to download a book
74:00 - and listen to it or um to to order a
74:03 - used copy for like a dollar or two on
74:06 - ebay um and have it delivered to your
74:08 - door and
74:09 - you know i think that just the process
74:11 - of reading these books and thinking
74:13 - about how they apply to your own life
74:15 - is incredibly valuable so
74:18 - you know even if you dispute like the
74:21 - scientific
74:23 - uh you know veracity
74:25 - uh and the methodology behind how they
74:27 - came to these conclusions just reading
74:29 - it and thinking about it is a helpful
74:31 - practice
74:32 - in my opinion so i i would encourage
74:34 - everybody to to give these a try
74:36 - and be relatively open-minded about it
74:40 - so just one last question for you uh
74:42 - alex
74:44 - yep
74:46 - if people want to know what's going on
74:48 - in the world of alexander callaway
74:50 - the canadian of you know who moved from
74:53 - russia
74:54 - learned a program got a developer job
74:56 - and is now helping
74:58 - so many people thousands of people stay
75:00 - motivated in their
75:02 - efforts to become developers themselves
75:04 - uh if people want to follow you
75:07 - what would be the best way for them to
75:09 - keep tabs on you and
75:11 - your eyes i think um twitter is the best
75:13 - way and now um
75:15 - this little newsletter that i'm gonna
75:18 - because what if like twitter goes down
75:20 - you know
75:21 - uh in a couple of years but it's
75:23 - probably not gonna happen uh so i
75:25 - usually use twitter at callaway and
75:27 - instead of ll it's one one so ka one one
75:30 - away
75:31 - um that's the best way um
75:34 - because yeah i'm also usually not on
75:36 - facebook i use it just to create like
75:38 - either create or monitor events for
75:40 - frequent camp toronto um
75:43 - but otherwise i don't really have a use
75:45 - for it um
75:46 - so yeah definitely twitter is the best
75:48 - way
75:50 - all right well thank you so much for
75:51 - joining us thank you everybody thank you
75:53 - it's a lot of fun yeah
75:55 - yeah it's it's great talking to you
75:56 - again i had a blast hanging out with you
75:58 - in toronto yeah
76:01 - next time i'm in toronto i definitely
76:03 - want to hang out and get another
76:05 - a w um root beer float with you yeah and
76:08 - you won't have to do airbnb you can live
76:10 - with us
76:11 - all right cool yeah
76:13 - yeah and speaking of which uh i see in
76:16 - the background you've got a happy
76:17 - birthday kind of strung across
76:19 - uh yeah tell us a little bit about that
76:22 - so yeah it's been um
76:24 - i guess i should have should have taken
76:26 - it down by now but uh on 8th of june it
76:28 - was my wife's birthday just because it
76:30 - looks nice with the heart like the heart
76:32 - stays there it's kind of like a little
76:33 - uh lamps bulbs um and it's kind of like
76:36 - around has happy birthday so yeah
76:40 - yeah
76:41 - well belated uh happy birthday to your
76:44 - wife anna i'll tell her for sure oh by
76:46 - the way she's learning to code as well
76:49 - she has finally succumbed
76:52 - awesome
76:53 - yeah
76:54 - so
76:54 - we're gonna be like a developer family
76:58 - that's great man well i hope you all
77:00 - have a beautiful weekend together i hope
77:01 - you all get plenty of coding in
77:03 - and you get plenty of exercise and yeah
77:06 - you've inspired me to start writing i'm
77:08 - gonna
77:08 - run soon yeah for sure good book on
77:11 - running that is both motivational and
77:13 - kind of instructive is is called uh i
77:15 - think it's called
77:16 - born to run like the
77:18 - like the song
77:20 - um
77:22 - it talks about um
77:25 - talks about
77:26 - forefoot running where you're running
77:27 - your four feet instead of like most
77:28 - people run on their heels
77:30 - and if you do that it kind of like
77:33 - yeah hurts your knees like a lot more of
77:34 - the impact is absorbed by your knees if
77:36 - you run on kind of the balls of your
77:38 - feet
77:39 - most of it's absorbed by your the
77:41 - tendons in your lower leg so
77:43 - that was one of the big breakthroughs
77:44 - that allowed me
77:46 - at 37 you know i started running
77:48 - probably you know seriously when i was
77:50 - about 30. but already by then my knees
77:53 - were kind of like
77:54 - giving me grief after like a run
77:57 - but ever since i switched to running on
77:58 - my four feet i i've had no problem so a
78:00 - lot of people say oh i can't run you
78:02 - know my knees are bad
78:04 - i would encourage them i'm not saying
78:05 - that like no your legs are fine just go
78:07 - do it uh if you're having serious issues
78:10 - with your with your legs i would
78:11 - definitely go talk to a doctor about it
78:13 - or maybe a kinesthesiologist or
78:15 - something but
78:16 - um i would definitely encourage before
78:19 - you dismiss running as an activity
78:21 - try running on the balls of your feet
78:23 - and it's a little unnatural when you
78:25 - first start and your
78:27 - strides are a lot shorter and you take
78:28 - strides a lot faster i've got like a
78:30 - playlist of like 180 bpm music that i
78:32 - listen to when i run
78:34 - um
78:35 - but
78:37 - it it really does work and i have had
78:40 - basically zero leg pain since i started
78:42 - doing that and i do you know
78:45 - at one point i was doing like 100
78:46 - kilometers a week
78:48 - um so
78:49 - yeah
78:51 - that's a lot
78:53 - all right well hey
78:54 - check out that book thank you for the
78:56 - recommendation yeah yeah have a
78:58 - beautiful weekend and uh hey everybody
79:01 - who's watching thanks for tuning in
79:02 - thank you so much
79:04 - happy coding everyone
79:06 - cheers bye
