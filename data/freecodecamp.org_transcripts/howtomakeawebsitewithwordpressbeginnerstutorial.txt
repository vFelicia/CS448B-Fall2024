00:00 - hi i'm beau with freecodecamp.org
00:03 - by the end of this course you will know
00:05 - how to make all of these different
00:06 - websites and how to customize them
00:09 - we'll be doing this all in wordpress and
00:12 - i'm going to teach you every step you
00:14 - need to know
00:15 - this course is perfect for beginners
00:18 - first i'll show you how to do the
00:19 - initial setup this includes getting a
00:22 - domain name hosting and installing
00:24 - wordpress a domain name is what people
00:27 - type into a web browser to get to your
00:29 - website some examples are youtube.com
00:32 - freecodecamp.org or wordpress.org
00:35 - hosting is where the files or data for
00:38 - your website are stored
00:39 - when someone goes to your website the
00:42 - files that make up your website have to
00:44 - be accessed from another computer
00:46 - somewhere else in the world
00:48 - the company that has the computer with
00:50 - your website files on it is called a
00:52 - hosting provider
00:54 - so what is wordpress
00:56 - wordpress is a content management system
00:59 - it helps you manage your content
01:01 - basically it helps you create a website
01:03 - even if you know nothing about coding
01:06 - you don't need to know html css or
01:08 - javascript you can do everything
01:10 - graphically with wordpress
01:12 - wordpress is by far the most popular way
01:15 - to make a website it is used by forty
01:17 - percent of all websites and best of all
01:20 - wordpress is free to use
01:23 - after we get the wordpress software
01:25 - installed i'll show you how to set up
01:27 - the installation and customize it for
01:29 - your purposes
01:31 - maybe you want to make the website into
01:33 - a blog or an e-commerce site or a
01:35 - website for a local business
01:37 - i'll show you how you can easily
01:39 - customize it for whatever your use case
01:41 - is
01:42 - then i'll show you how to update the
01:43 - design
01:44 - i'll show you how you can make your
01:46 - website have the exact look that you
01:48 - want it to have
01:50 - i'll show you how to get your own images
01:52 - into the page and use the colors that
01:54 - you want
01:55 - right now i'm going to show you how to
01:57 - get your domain and your hosting
02:00 - this is the part that you will have to
02:01 - pay some money for but it is pretty
02:04 - cheap
02:04 - the name usually costs between 10 and 20
02:07 - dollars per year and hosting often costs
02:10 - around five dollars per month but i'll
02:12 - show you how you can save some money on
02:14 - this
02:15 - we'll actually get the domain and
02:16 - hosting at the same place
02:18 - hostinger provided free codecamp a grant
02:20 - to make this course possible and we'll
02:22 - use hostinger to get the domain and
02:24 - hosting
02:25 - they're one of the cheapest hosting
02:27 - providers and they have good service
02:28 - i've actually used them in the past for
02:30 - my personal websites before we got this
02:32 - grant
02:33 - and they make it super simple to set up
02:35 - a wordpress website
02:37 - just so you know everything i teach in
02:38 - this course will work with other hosting
02:40 - providers as well so you don't have to
02:42 - go with hostinger
02:44 - but some things about hostinger is that
02:46 - they offer a free domain ssl and 99
02:49 - uptime guarantee
02:51 - so we'll go to hostinger.com we have a
02:53 - link in the description that's going to
02:54 - give you a better deal than what you
02:55 - would normally get
02:57 - so click go for it we'll go down here
02:59 - and we have we have the single shared
03:01 - hosting and the premium shared hosting
03:03 - now
03:04 - if you're just go if you're just
03:06 - starting out you're a beginner you may
03:07 - just want to go with the single shared
03:08 - hosting the cheapest one the main thing
03:11 - to look at is really really the main
03:13 - thing is that this one comes with a free
03:15 - domain and this one does not come with a
03:17 - free domain but it's just an 8.99 value
03:20 - so if you get
03:21 - this version you can just get the domain
03:23 - separately for 8.99 or possibly a little
03:27 - more depending on what your your uh
03:29 - whether it's me a dot com or a.net or
03:32 - what the the end of the domain is
03:34 - different types of domains cost
03:36 - different amounts but they're generally
03:37 - around 8.99 so you may just want to go
03:40 - with this one that's 99 cents a month
03:43 - and then just pay for the domain
03:44 - separately instead of doing this one
03:46 - that's 219 a month but you can see that
03:49 - this is just the promotional rate
03:50 - anyways it's going to be 4.99 a month
03:52 - when you renew or 2.99 per month when
03:55 - you renew so you just you really want to
03:57 - kind of look at what the real rate is
03:59 - and not just a promotional rate
04:02 - so if we select this one right here
04:04 - and then you're gonna actually have to
04:06 - choose whether you want to go with the
04:08 - one month pay by month or pay by
04:11 - 12 months 24 months or 48 months you can
04:13 - see that the 99 the 99 price is only for
04:16 - 48 months personally i think the 12
04:19 - months is the most reasonable especially
04:21 - when you're just starting out
04:23 - you don't want to commit to 48 months
04:25 - unless you're sure you're gonna want to
04:27 - use this for
04:28 - actually that long so i'll just go to
04:31 - the 12 month plan
04:32 - and then you can just choose how you
04:34 - want to pay for it
04:36 - and then enter all your information
04:38 - now i already have an account so i'm not
04:40 - going to enter all my information right
04:41 - here i'm just going to log into my
04:43 - account where i already have everything
04:45 - set up
04:46 - so once you get signed up and you've
04:49 - paid and you're logged in you'll be
04:50 - taken to this dashboard
04:52 - and
04:53 - if you got the plan that includes a free
04:55 - domain you can claim your free domain or
04:59 - you can just get your domain during the
05:00 - setup process including purchasing one
05:03 - if your plan does not come with a free
05:04 - domain
05:05 - this is what we are going to do so i'll
05:08 - click setup under premium shared hosting
05:11 - okay welcome to hosinger quincy my name
05:14 - is actually beau but quincy larson is
05:17 - also with free codecamp and this account
05:19 - is actually in his name so i'll click
05:21 - start now
05:23 - okay here we get to choose what type of
05:25 - category you're in either you're
05:27 - claiming a free domain because you have
05:28 - the right type of hosting or account to
05:30 - get that you're going to buy a domain
05:32 - because maybe you sign up for the
05:33 - account that doesn't include a free
05:35 - domain but you still need one or you're
05:37 - going to use an existing domain first
05:39 - i'll show you how to claim a domain the
05:41 - process is similar if you're going to
05:43 - buy a domain
05:44 - afterwards i will show you how to use an
05:46 - existing domain
05:48 - so i'm going to try robotoysreview.com
05:53 - okay that's available you may have to
05:55 - try a few times to get a domain name
05:57 - that's available because a lot of domain
05:59 - names already taken
06:02 - but let me hit continue here
06:05 - and then i am going to
06:07 - skip i will start from scratch
06:11 - and i can choose my website location
06:15 - let's do north america
06:17 - because that's where i am at
06:19 - finish setup
06:21 - okay my website is ready now i'm going
06:23 - to go to the control panel i'm going to
06:24 - manage manage the site
06:27 - and if you somehow get out of it and
06:29 - you're at this main site you can always
06:31 - go to hosting
06:33 - and then you can go to
06:36 - manage for your manage your website here
06:39 - before i show you how to manage your
06:41 - domain and setup wordpress let me show
06:43 - you how you can use a domain purchased
06:45 - elsewhere
06:46 - it's easiest to get your domain your
06:48 - hosting from the same company however
06:51 - it's not required you can get your
06:53 - domain from one company and host your
06:55 - website with a different company so let
06:57 - me show you how you would host a website
07:00 - on hostinger if you got your domain from
07:03 - a different company now you can just
07:05 - skip this section if you're just going
07:06 - the easy route you're just getting
07:08 - everything from hostinger but if for
07:10 - some reason you do get a domain from
07:12 - somewhere else i'll show you how you can
07:14 - set it up so host so you're hosting it
07:16 - at hostinger so in this example i got a
07:20 - domain called robotfamilyreviews.com
07:23 - from google domains no matter where you
07:25 - get your domain there's going to be
07:27 - somewhere in the dashboard where you can
07:30 - update the name servers it could be
07:33 - under something called dns it could just
07:35 - be under something called name servers
07:37 - so we're gonna have to update that in
07:40 - order to make sure that we're hosting
07:42 - this name with hostinger so i'm going to
07:45 - go to use custom name servers and it
07:47 - could look a little different depending
07:49 - on what company you bought the name
07:50 - server
07:51 - what company bought the domain name from
07:54 - but it's going to be pretty similar to
07:55 - this so i'm going to put
07:57 - ns1.dnsparking.com
08:03 - this name server this website here is
08:05 - specific to hostinger so
08:08 - this is something owned by hostinger and
08:10 - this it's how you connect your domain to
08:13 - hostinger so i'm actually going to copy
08:15 - this i'll click save
08:17 - and i'm going to oh i have to add
08:19 - another one so i'm going to press plus
08:21 - and then i'm going to do ns2
08:24 - so
08:25 - these are the website
08:26 - ns1.dns-parking.comns2.dnsparking.com
08:31 - so these if i save this
08:33 - now it says it could take effect within
08:36 - the next 48 hours so it could take a but
08:39 - it may be this day and maybe in the next
08:42 - hour or two so it's going to take a
08:44 - little while for it to be connected
08:45 - correctly but now we've done everything
08:47 - from our domain to get this connected to
08:50 - hostinger
08:51 - a little later i'll show you one extra
08:53 - thing you have to do on hosting her to
08:54 - make sure it's connected to this domain
08:57 - okay now we're completely logged into
08:59 - our hosting account it's associated with
09:02 - our website and now we have to install
09:05 - wordpress
09:06 - and just in case you want to use a
09:08 - different domain name let me show you
09:11 - how you would do that now you probably
09:13 - won't want to do that you'll probably
09:14 - want to just use the domain name that
09:16 - you got with hostinger but if you do get
09:18 - another domain name and you want to make
09:20 - sure it works with the files that you're
09:21 - hosting on hostinger i'll show you what
09:23 - you can do you can scroll down here and
09:26 - we'll go to add website and i'm just
09:29 - going to add
09:31 - another website that that i purchased
09:33 - elsewhere so you can actually have a
09:35 - website that's from elsewhere that from
09:38 - a different company go to the hostinger
09:40 - hosting so i'm gonna do robot
09:43 - familyreviews.com
09:49 - and make sure it's spelled right
09:54 - and then we'll do a password
09:57 - [Music]
09:59 - and then add the website
10:02 - so that's one cool thing about
10:03 - hostingers if depending on what plan you
10:05 - have if you have the right plan you can
10:07 - host multiple websites on one account so
10:09 - you only have to pay for hosting one
10:11 - time and then you can host a bunch of
10:12 - websites on there so then this drop down
10:15 - menu would point to which up what's
10:17 - website you're going to update so i'm
10:19 - going to robot family reviews
10:22 - and so since i set the dns settings to
10:25 - hostinger i'm at
10:27 - robotfamilyreviews.com and this is just
10:29 - the default page that hosting or show is
10:31 - before you set that up
10:32 - so let's go back and set up the page so
10:36 - it doesn't matter if you
10:38 - got your domain name right through
10:39 - hostinger or if you got somewhere else
10:42 - and then pointed it at hostinger we are
10:44 - going to set up wordpress right now so
10:47 - in order to set up wordpress i'm going
10:49 - to scroll down here and then i'm going
10:51 - to go to
10:53 - auto installer this is going to let me
10:55 - auto install wordpress
10:58 - on the website
10:59 - okay you're probably not going to see
11:00 - anything right here because you probably
11:02 - don't have wordpress already installed
11:04 - but if you've already
11:05 - installed wordpress on any of your
11:06 - domains will show up here but this is
11:09 - how you installed wordpress for the
11:11 - first time on one of your domains
11:13 - probably just one domain so we have we
11:15 - can click that we want to install we
11:17 - want to select that we want to install
11:19 - wordpress there are also a few other
11:21 - things that we can install like if you
11:23 - were going to have an ecommerce site you
11:25 - may want woocommerce as well but we're
11:28 - just going to install wordpress
11:31 - okay and you'll probably just want to
11:34 - keep the default for all of this but
11:37 - since this account was actually
11:38 - registered to quincy and my name is bo
11:40 - i'm going to update this to bo
11:44 - but again you'll probably just keep the
11:45 - default and everything else we can keep
11:47 - the default i'll put in a password here
11:50 - [Music]
11:52 - and then the website title it's going to
11:54 - be called robot family reviews
11:59 - okay and i'll just click install
12:05 - okay it's finished installing so i'm
12:06 - going to go to my website again and i'm
12:09 - going to refresh
12:11 - and here it is robot family reviews we
12:13 - have our wordpress installed go here you
12:16 - can see the url up here robot family
12:19 - reviews
12:20 - and it says hello world welcome to
12:22 - wordpress i'm going to zoom in a little
12:24 - bit so you can see that better this is
12:26 - just the default page that wordpress
12:29 - creates
12:30 - so we're going to do a lot of
12:32 - customizing to this but we can see that
12:34 - we have it successfully
12:36 - installed okay so let me show you how
12:39 - we're gonna get into our wordpress
12:41 - dashboard to start editing it you we
12:44 - don't even have to go back to the
12:46 - hostinger website right from this
12:48 - website we're gonna go into the url bar
12:50 - and i'm going to put slash wp admin
12:54 - so on most wordpress websites
12:57 - the url slash wp-admin
13:00 - is where you go to administer and be the
13:03 - administrator for the website or to
13:04 - configure the website
13:06 - so let me press enter here
13:09 - and now we have to log in we'll log in
13:11 - with the information we use when we
13:13 - created when we installed wordpress so
13:16 - for my username i'll put bo and the
13:18 - password
13:19 - will be the password i selected before
13:21 - click login
13:24 - we are in
13:26 - our wordpress dashboard so here is where
13:29 - we can start customizing our website
13:33 - we finished setting up the website and
13:34 - hosting we got the domain name we got
13:37 - wordpress on installed on the hosting
13:39 - provider we logged into the dashboard
13:42 - now we're going to start setting up and
13:44 - customizing the wordpress options
13:47 - so what we're going to go do first is go
13:49 - to the plugins here and see what
13:52 - installed plug-ins we have so you can
13:54 - see there are quite a few things already
13:56 - installed and the truth is we're just
13:59 - going to start from scratch a lot of
14:01 - these uh default plugins aren't really
14:04 - that necessary because they may not
14:07 - really specifically apply to what we're
14:08 - going to try to do so i'm going to
14:10 - select all the plugins here i am going
14:13 - to
14:14 - delete all of them
14:17 - and i'm sure i wanted to delete them
14:22 - and some i may have to oh some of them
14:24 - i'm going to deactivate first so i'm
14:26 - going to deactivate and apply
14:30 - and now i will
14:32 - delete all of them
14:34 - don't worry because all these can be
14:35 - reinstalled if you need them we're just
14:36 - going to start from scratch and show
14:38 - everything that we want to install all
14:40 - the plug-ins they're going to work for
14:41 - the page that we're creating here
14:44 - so let's go back to the dashboard
14:48 - and so here's our main dashboard
14:51 - so this dashboard is the back end of the
14:54 - website
14:55 - it's where you control all the options
14:56 - it's where you go to edit your website
14:59 - and you can see whenever you want to see
15:00 - your website
15:02 - let me just show the different tabs up
15:04 - here if i click robot family reviews
15:06 - it's going to go right to the main
15:08 - website where i can click back also if i
15:10 - click here and click visit site it's
15:12 - going to go to the site
15:14 - so first i want to show you before we
15:15 - get into all the customizing i want to
15:17 - show you how you would make sure you
15:18 - have the most updated version of what of
15:21 - wordpress so if you click updates here
15:23 - right on the dashboard
15:25 - we can see that there are nothing
15:27 - there's nothing to update if there's
15:29 - anything to update it would say
15:30 - something like update or there'll be a
15:32 - button around here but we have the
15:34 - latest version so we don't have to do
15:36 - anything as far as updating but
15:38 - something you can keep an eye on over
15:39 - time you you probably want to get the
15:41 - latest version just in case there's any
15:42 - security updates that could be important
15:45 - to keeping your website secure
15:47 - okay now let's look at how we can
15:50 - add a user or change the password of the
15:52 - user
15:53 - so if i go to users here we have
15:55 - currently one user
15:56 - and it's bo and if i was gonna to change
15:59 - the password i'll just click here go to
16:01 - edit
16:03 - and then there's all these things i can
16:05 - change here
16:08 - including setting a new password but i
16:11 - like my password so we're not going to
16:12 - do that
16:13 - this is also where you can add a new
16:16 - user if i click add new you can have
16:18 - multiple users that can log in to the
16:22 - administrator portion of your wordpress
16:24 - page and each user could have different
16:27 - roles so maybe one person can only add
16:30 - new blog posts where another person can
16:33 - actually redesign the whole website
16:36 - depending on what what what abilities
16:39 - you want to give to each user okay next
16:41 - we're going to set up what the urls of
16:43 - our pages and posts will look like
16:46 - so i'll go to settings here
16:49 - and then i'm going to go to where it
16:51 - says permalinks
16:54 - okay so the default is that it's going
16:56 - to
16:58 - have your root url and it's going to be
17:01 - slash index.psp
17:05 - and then we don't want to have all this
17:07 - extra thing so what i'm going to do is
17:09 - just change it to post name so the url
17:12 - is just going to be a url of something
17:15 - on our website it's just going to be our
17:17 - root url
17:18 - and then just sample dash post or this
17:20 - would be just the post name so we i
17:23 - don't i mean if you want you can include
17:25 - the dates in here if you want to include
17:27 - the day and name or the month and name
17:28 - or number but we're just going to have
17:31 - the name of the post after the the root
17:33 - url but it's really up to you how you
17:35 - want to do that so i'll just go to save
17:38 - changes and we're done with that
17:40 - next we'll update the theme the theme is
17:44 - the overall look and feel of a website
17:46 - certain themes will make it easier to
17:48 - update different parts of the website so
17:50 - let me go to appearance and themes
17:54 - so by default there's just these three
17:56 - themes and we're on this one right now
17:58 - but there's hundreds or thousands of
18:01 - wordpress themes you can install and
18:03 - we're gonna do that right now we're

19:27 - looks like with our new theme
19:30 - it still doesn't it still doesn't look
19:32 - very nice because we're still going
19:34 - going to be doing a lot more updating to
19:36 - customizing exactly how we want but this
19:38 - theme is going to make customizing even
19:41 - easier and you can see now you can see
19:43 - this bar at the top
19:45 - this bar is going to appear anytime
19:47 - you're logged in to wordpress and you're
19:50 - on your website and it's going to make
19:52 - it easier to customize individual pages
19:55 - if i just click customize here i could
19:56 - start start editing this page directly
19:59 - we're not going to do that right now but
20:00 - we will do that a little later i'm going
20:02 - to go back to the dashboard so i'm going
20:04 - to click right here
20:05 - and now we're gonna add some plugins
20:07 - that we need so i'm gonna go to plugins
20:10 - so a theme determines the look and feel
20:12 - of your website plugins add new features
20:15 - and functionalities
20:16 - for instance with a plugin you can add a
20:18 - contact form to your website also you
20:20 - could block spam comments implement a
20:22 - shopping cart there's just tons of
20:24 - different things that plugins can help
20:26 - you add to your website depending on
20:28 - what theme there may be some recommended
20:30 - plugins and one of them is ocean extra
20:33 - for this one so let's just begin
20:35 - installing this plug-in and then i'll
20:37 - click install
20:40 - okay now after we get ocean extra
20:42 - installed there's just one more plug-in
20:44 - we're going to install go to add new and
20:46 - this next one is called elementor
20:51 - and you can see this has 5 million
20:53 - active installations it's one of the
20:55 - most popular wordpress
20:58 - plugins and
21:00 - it makes it very easy to design
21:02 - professional looking web pages without
21:04 - coding it gives a drag and drop
21:07 - page builder you can see pixel perfect
21:09 - design mobile responsive editing it
21:11 - makes it just a lot easier especially
21:13 - for beginners to design a website so i'm
21:15 - going to install this one
21:18 - okay let's go to the list of all of our
21:20 - plugins again i'm going to select them
21:21 - all
21:23 - and then i'm going to activate
21:25 - apply
21:27 - so we're going to activate both plugins
21:29 - that we installed so here's this welcome
21:31 - screen
21:32 - we're going to just skip this we don't
21:34 - need to go through this getting started
21:35 - right now
21:38 - and let's go back to the plugins again
21:40 - just to make sure it worked
21:43 - the elementor is activated but we need
21:45 - to make sure ocean extra is also
21:46 - activated
21:49 - you know i think this plugin got
21:51 - installed wrong so that could happen if
21:53 - that happens no it's not a problem we'll
21:55 - just delete this and then we're going to
21:58 - reinstall it
22:00 - so let me just refresh this page
22:04 - and begin installing this program again
22:07 - this plug-in i mean
22:09 - i think the problem is i went off the
22:11 - page while i was installing it before so
22:13 - that could happen to you too not a
22:15 - problem you just delete it and then
22:16 - reinstall it
22:23 - okay it's all installed it could take a
22:25 - little while you just have to kind of
22:27 - wait till it finishes so i'll go to
22:28 - return to dashboard
22:32 - and with
22:33 - oceanwt it has a setup wizard so let's
22:36 - do run the setup wizard
22:39 - and it's going to show you the different
22:40 - things that you can do so to get started
22:43 - so the first thing to do is select the
22:45 - demo template so this is something
22:47 - that's pretty great about oceanwp
22:50 - is that it has all these demos included
22:52 - with it and
22:54 - a lot of them are free now the way they
22:56 - make money is that some of them you do
22:58 - have to pay for but these ones that are
23:00 - included here these are ones are all
23:02 - free that we can see right here so we
23:04 - can choose which demo looks most similar
23:08 - to what we want if you're gonna do an
23:10 - e-commerce you can do store we have
23:12 - personal simple
23:14 - you can even do a preview so i could do
23:17 - a live preview of this
23:19 - and then
23:21 - see and if i like this preview i can
23:23 - import it you can see there's different
23:26 - uh
23:27 - blog tips so we're gonna go to with
23:30 - something more simple here i'm just
23:31 - gonna go back here
23:34 - okay and i kind of like the this lawyer
23:36 - one now you can create you can choose
23:39 - any one you want and all the things i'm
23:42 - about to teach you are going to apply no
23:44 - matter which of these
23:47 - demo templates that you choose and i'm
23:50 - not making a page about a lawyer but i
23:52 - just like some of these things that are
23:54 - in the lawyer page i kind of like how
23:56 - it's set up and like i said we're going
23:58 - to be able to change every single one of
24:00 - the we're going to be able to customize
24:01 - this so you don't have to be making
24:04 - a website about whatever the like the
24:07 - name of this
24:08 - demo is
24:10 - we can choose lawyer even though we're
24:12 - not making a website about a lawyer so
24:14 - i'll just select this one
24:18 - and i'll go to the bottom and install
24:20 - demo
24:22 - and depending on which demo you install
24:25 - there's going to be specific plugins
24:28 - that are necessary just for that demo so
24:31 - let's click install now
24:33 - install now
24:34 - now when it says get this add-on that
24:36 - means we are going to actually have to
24:38 - pay extra for it
24:40 - but the good thing is it's optional
24:43 - we don't need to get this add-on it's
24:45 - just an optional thing that you can get
24:48 - and so we're just not even going to get
24:49 - those add-ons and we're going to see how
24:51 - we can still customize and make the
24:53 - website exactly how we want even without
24:55 - getting those add-ons so i will now
24:58 - click import
25:00 - and here is where we we can customize it
25:03 - right from the screen if we wanted we
25:05 - can upload a new logo we can set the
25:07 - title the tagline and the thing is we
25:10 - can actually change all this stuff later
25:13 - so i'm going to skip this step because i
25:15 - want to show you how we can change all
25:16 - this stuff right from within wordpress
25:18 - so i'm going to skip this step
25:20 - and you know we don't need any of this
25:22 - stuff so i'll just click view the
25:23 - website
25:26 - okay so now i'm going to click visit
25:29 - website
25:30 - and so here is our updated website you
25:34 - can see it's all about being a lawyer
25:35 - now but we can change all of that and we
25:38 - are going to do that so i'm going to
25:41 - close this
25:42 - okay we're back at the dashboard let me
25:44 - dismiss this
25:46 - um we can also if we want to we can
25:48 - activate this
25:50 - but i don't want to so i'm going to skip
25:51 - it and going to this theme panel button
25:54 - here if somehow you messed up when you
25:56 - were installing your demo or it didn't
25:58 - install right or you went off the screen
26:00 - you could go and click on this theme
26:02 - panel and this is where you would
26:03 - install the demo you could run the setup
26:05 - wizard which we already ran we could run
26:07 - that again but we're not going to run
26:09 - that again we already ran it okay we got
26:11 - our theme and our demo installed let's
26:13 - just see what it looks like i can go up
26:15 - here click visit site
26:18 - and so this is our lawyer theme
26:22 - like obviously like i said we're not
26:24 - lawyers but the next step i'm going to
26:26 - show you is how to use this as the base
26:29 - of our website and just go through and
26:31 - start customizing things and how to
26:34 - customize the text how to customize the
26:36 - image how to customize layouts to go
26:39 - along with what our site is actually
26:41 - supposed to be about
26:43 - so i'm going to go back over to the
26:44 - dashboard
26:46 - we decided we're not going to activate
26:48 - the social sharing buttons so let me
26:50 - show you how to remove this message
26:53 - it just got installed with everything
26:54 - else so i can
26:56 - click here and go just to i can just
26:58 - deactivate
26:59 - it's a temporary dfx deactivation
27:01 - because who knows maybe we'll want it in
27:03 - the future
27:04 - okay i'm going to go back over here
27:06 - and that gives gets that out of the way
27:09 - now we're going to install just one more
27:11 - plug-in before we start customizing
27:13 - everything so i'm going to go back to
27:15 - the plug-ins screen again i guess it
27:17 - could have stayed on there
27:19 - and the plugin is going to help us back
27:21 - up our wordpress site
27:23 - it's good to have everything backed up
27:25 - just in case you make a mistake or
27:27 - something goes wrong you want to have a
27:28 - backup of your website so you can use it
27:30 - later and also let's just get rid of
27:32 - this too because this is a paid
27:34 - extension which we don't really need so
27:37 - i'll just get rid of that it's basically
27:38 - just an ad that shows up so
27:41 - i'm going to go to add new and this time
27:44 - we're going to install a plug-in that
27:45 - will help us back up our
27:48 - wordpress installation and this one is
27:50 - going to be called all
27:53 - and
27:54 - so we get all in one wp
27:56 - migration and this is going to allow us
27:58 - to back up our site and you can see it's
28:01 - very popular three three million
28:03 - installations
28:06 - and we're just getting that installed
28:08 - okay that's installed i'm going to
28:10 - activate that
28:12 - okay now let me show you how that this
28:13 - would work you click on all in one wp
28:16 - migration and we can export there's two
28:19 - ways to do the backup one we can export
28:21 - our entire site to store on our computer
28:24 - so if we just do
28:27 - export to file
28:32 - okay now just click download
28:36 - you can close that
28:38 - and then you can always just import it
28:40 - if you want to
28:42 - another way is to go to the backups tab
28:45 - here
28:46 - so
28:47 - the cool thing about this extension is
28:49 - it will also automatically save backups
28:52 - right to your wordpress server so you
28:55 - don't actually even need to download
28:57 - anything it's good to export the site
28:59 - every once in a while so you have a back
29:01 - uh like a master backup
29:03 - but you can also create a backup right
29:06 - onto the wordpress server and it'll just
29:08 - be saved right onto your server and then
29:10 - whenever you want you can either
29:12 - download it or you can restore right
29:14 - from here so that's another way to do
29:15 - backups
29:17 - and now we're going to start customizing
29:19 - the website
29:20 - so we could go right through these links
29:22 - here to customize another way you could
29:24 - customize is going to the theme panel
29:28 - and then at the very bottom there's all
29:30 - these things about uploading your logo
29:32 - adding the favicon choosing your primary
29:34 - color choosing your typography
29:36 - so you could update it through that way
29:38 - but i'm going to show you a different
29:39 - way to update it the way the reason why
29:42 - this other update way to update is good
29:44 - because it works across all themes
29:47 - even if you don't even install a custom
29:49 - theme you can still update your website
29:52 - this way so i'm going to go to
29:55 - the dashboard actually i'm going to go
29:56 - right to the site here and click visit
29:58 - site and once you're on the site you can
30:01 - go to any page in your site
30:04 - and you can just click
30:06 - customize
30:07 - so now we're customizing anything and we
30:09 - can click on any of these
30:11 - sections here to customize different
30:14 - things
30:14 - so first we're going to customize the
30:16 - general look of everything so i'm going
30:18 - to go to site identity
30:20 - and we already know the title is robot
30:22 - family reviews which you could change if
30:24 - you wanted but for the tagline and this
30:27 - could show up in search bars or i mean
30:30 - in search engines so it's good to have
30:32 - something that really relates to your
30:33 - your website here so i'm going to say
30:37 - reviews of robot
30:39 - toys
30:42 - and then i'll go back now i'm going to
30:44 - make a lot of changes and then i'm going
30:45 - to click publish to publish all of them
30:47 - at once
30:48 - so or i can actually just publish it
30:50 - right now and then you can kind of we'll
30:52 - see how it goes the changes as we go
30:54 - so now i'm going to change the logo we
30:58 - got the logo here i'll just click this
31:00 - logo and you can also go
31:03 - a different way to do it you can click
31:05 - header
31:06 - and then we can click logo to update the
31:08 - logo
31:09 - and i'm going to remove this logo
31:12 - we are going to create well you can see
31:14 - removing the logo automatically just
31:15 - puts text here instead of logo so i'm
31:17 - going to create an all new logo to use
31:20 - on this website so there's a cool
31:23 - website you can use to create a logo for
31:26 - free okay i'm at logomaker.com and we're
31:29 - going to create our logo so i'm going to
31:32 - do a search and remember this is all
31:34 - about robots so you can search for
31:36 - anything but i'm going to search for the
31:37 - word robot
31:38 - [Music]
31:40 - and try to see which thing i want to use
31:42 - for my
31:43 - logo
31:45 - uh a lot of these look kind of cool i
31:48 - kind of like the simplicity of this one
31:50 - so i'm going to use this as my logo
31:52 - and then i'm going to put some text here
31:55 - too and it's just going to be called
31:57 - robot
31:58 - reviews
32:02 - and so i will make this a little bigger
32:08 - i can move this around
32:11 - and
32:13 - i had zoomed in a
32:16 - little bit but i will zoom out
32:20 - okay so i'll click this text and this is
32:22 - where you can change the font
32:24 - so let's see which one looks the most
32:27 - like a robot
32:30 - well i kind of like this one i guess
32:32 - it's not like a robot but we're gonna
32:35 - change the colors of everything too i
32:37 - can select both of these and now i can
32:41 - make this color go to any type of color
32:43 - i want
32:44 - i'm going to do this
32:45 - blue color
32:47 - kind of like this
32:49 - and i'm going to make this text a little
32:51 - bigger so it's closer to the size of
32:58 - of this image
32:59 - and then i'll make the image a little
33:00 - smaller
33:05 - okay robot reviews so now i'm going
33:08 - going to click the save button
33:10 - i don't need the high resolution i'm
33:12 - just going to say no thanks download the
33:13 - low resolution and the great thing about
33:15 - this website is it's one of the few
33:18 - websites where you don't have to create
33:19 - an account in order to create a free
33:22 - logo
33:23 - so we got that
33:25 - now i just want one with just this
33:27 - robot thing so i'm going to click the
33:29 - text i'm going to delete the text now
33:31 - i'm going to save that
33:35 - and i'll download the low resolution
33:37 - file
33:39 - okay let's go back to our wordpress site
33:41 - and now i'm going to select the logo
33:44 - okay i'm just going to drag this over
33:46 - from off screen
33:48 - so
33:49 - then
33:50 - i'm going to
33:53 - call it robot reviews
33:56 - logo
33:57 - and i'll put that as the alt text also
34:01 - and then click select
34:04 - and then i'm gonna make sure the whole
34:06 - thing is selected up here
34:08 - and
34:10 - crop image or you can just do skip
34:12 - cropping
34:17 - okay now if i hit publish it should show
34:20 - up on here
34:26 - and then i'm also going to have to
34:28 - refresh the page
34:31 - okay if you add the logo and it doesn't
34:33 - show up correctly
34:35 - it could be because if you're on a
34:37 - retina display
34:38 - it still has the other
34:40 - default logo stored as the retina logo
34:43 - so you may have to go in here you may
34:46 - have to select an image
34:48 - and if you just choose an image and it
34:51 - could get really small but then if you
34:53 - just remove
34:55 - then it will default to the normal logo
34:57 - whether you have the retina display or
34:58 - not so that's something i ran into since
35:01 - i do have a retina display that i'm
35:02 - recording this on you may just have to
35:04 - select any logo and then remove it and
35:06 - then it will just default back to the
35:08 - normal logo okay so we have the logo
35:11 - updated
35:12 - so now let's see how we can update the
35:15 - general colors used on our website you
35:17 - can see how it uses this gold color
35:19 - there's a line right here there's a gold
35:21 - color there's a line right here so let's
35:24 - see how we can update what colors are
35:26 - used on the website i go back here
35:29 - okay i'm gonna go to general options i'm
35:31 - going to general styling
35:33 - and now we can select what our primary
35:36 - and hover colors are and the border
35:38 - color we can update all these different
35:40 - colors so i want to figure out what
35:42 - color this robot reviews
35:45 - logo is so let me go back over to my
35:47 - logo website and i can actually just
35:49 - copy this hex color right here i can see
35:52 - this number right here with letters this
35:54 - is the the color so i'm going to just
35:57 - copy that and i'll go back over to
35:59 - wordpress and now i'm gonna
36:01 - put that as the primary color so i can
36:03 - go around and select any color like this
36:05 - or i can just paste in a hex code
36:09 - and
36:11 - then we're done with that and then for
36:12 - my
36:13 - hover my hover primary color i'm just
36:16 - going to choose something that's a
36:17 - little darker
36:19 - maybe a little purplish here and now i'm
36:21 - going to click publish
36:24 - and then i'll refresh
36:27 - and you can see a few things change
36:30 - colors so we have these down here that
36:32 - change colors this little line but we
36:34 - have to change we have to update the
36:36 - color in a few more places i'll show you
36:38 - that later
36:39 - but now let's add the favicon so we
36:42 - update the logo we updated some colors
36:45 - and we'll be doing more colors later and
36:47 - now let's update the favicon which is
36:49 - what appears in a tab or in the u in the
36:53 - bar in your browser like in the tab
36:55 - right next to the site name that little
36:57 - picture so we're going to go to
37:01 - site identity
37:02 - and then select a site icon so i'm just
37:05 - going to upload a file here
37:08 - and then i'm going to upload this so
37:11 - i'll put favicon
37:14 - and then i'll just select that
37:16 - and it shows a preview of what it's
37:17 - going to look like
37:19 - looks pretty good
37:20 - okay i'll crop the image
37:23 - now there's a bunch more things we can
37:25 - customize you can see there's all these
37:27 - things we can customize and we're gonna
37:29 - come back to a few of these later
37:31 - if you want you can play around yourself
37:33 - and just try changing things you can
37:35 - always go back if you
37:37 - make try something one way you can
37:39 - always go back to the other way you can
37:41 - kind of experiment with what your
37:42 - website you with what you want your
37:44 - website to look like but i'm going to
37:46 - show you another way to be editing the
37:48 - website and that's what we're going to
37:49 - use to edit some of these colors and
37:51 - some other things so we're going to do
37:53 - something to edit the actual content of
37:55 - the website so this is mainly editing
37:58 - what things look like like the logo some
38:01 - colors fonts
38:03 - font size
38:04 - but we're going to edit actually the
38:06 - text and then other things on the
38:08 - website so let me click publish to make
38:09 - sure everything's published here hit x
38:11 - here
38:12 - okay now we're going to go through and
38:13 - find out how to edit each section of
38:15 - this
38:16 - website we are going to find out how to
38:19 - change the words change more colors
38:22 - change the layout add images
38:25 - add links and it's all possibly simpler
38:29 - than you would expect
38:31 - so you'll notice that we no longer have
38:32 - the top bar in here it's because i
38:35 - actually restarted my browser and it got
38:37 - logged out
38:39 - so
38:40 - whenever you don't see the top bar that
38:42 - means you're logged out of wordpress
38:44 - and you need to get logged back in
38:46 - before you can start editing so let's do
38:48 - that again so if you remember you just
38:49 - go to the main url and do wp slash admin
38:53 - and then you go to that page you can log
38:54 - in with the information you you set up
38:57 - when you first installed wordpress
38:59 - [Music]
39:03 - okay now i can go back to the site by
39:06 - going to visit site and then anytime you
39:08 - see this top bar you on each page you
39:11 - can either click edit page or edit with
39:14 - elementor now edit page is the default
39:16 - way of editing it's called gutenberg and
39:19 - it's pretty good but
39:21 - there's elementor just makes it more
39:24 - user friendly there's a lot it's more
39:25 - graphical you can drag things around and
39:27 - it kind of gives you a little more
39:29 - it makes a little some things a little
39:31 - easier to do so we're going to go to
39:33 - edit with elementor
39:35 - okay so here's elementor we have our
39:37 - page on this side but we have this new
39:39 - menu over here which are elements we can
39:41 - add to the page
39:43 - so we can actually bring in elements
39:45 - just like i can click an element like
39:47 - image and i can bring it right here and
39:48 - it will put an image here now it's
39:50 - currently blank or a placeholder image
39:53 - but i'll show you how to actually make
39:55 - into your own image in a second here but
39:58 - you can also click on any of these spots
40:01 - and edit
40:03 - the sections now see i have to actually
40:05 - scroll back and forth that's just
40:07 - because i'm kind of zoomed in here so
40:08 - you can see the elements on the page a
40:10 - little better
40:12 - on your computer
40:13 - it may actually just show up everything
40:15 - at once you may not have to scroll back
40:18 - and forth here
40:19 - so here you can actually just edit the
40:21 - text so i can say
40:25 - read
40:26 - amazing
40:29 - robot reviews
40:32 - okay over here we can change settings
40:34 - like i can center the text i can write a
40:36 - line i can go to style i can change the
40:39 - text color if i wanted see i can make it
40:41 - any color
40:43 - i'm just going to keep it as white but i
40:45 - can even change the blend mode so maybe
40:48 - if i do lighten
40:50 - see how this look what this looks so if
40:52 - i go to overlay you can kind of see it
40:53 - now you can see through it just slightly
40:56 - i can turn on a text shadow
40:59 - if i want so i could
41:06 - so i could make this darker
41:12 - so you can do all sorts of things
41:14 - now this text is not going to let me
41:16 - change the size here because there's
41:19 - some text where where it's
41:22 - like key
41:23 - pieces of content the styling is
41:26 - actually in a different spot but if i go
41:28 - down here i should be able to change the
41:29 - size so
41:31 - if i go
41:33 - over here now this is just
41:35 - basically default text um
41:38 - placeholder text i'm going to keep the
41:40 - placeholder text i'm not going to go
41:41 - through and add updated text for every
41:43 - section but if you're creating your own
41:44 - website obviously every piece of
41:46 - placeholder text you're going to want to
41:48 - update to the content that you actually
41:50 - want
41:51 - but you can change things like if i
41:52 - select that i can make that bold and you
41:54 - can see it changes the bold over here
41:58 - see i can scroll down here and there's
42:00 - more settings i can change
42:02 - so
42:03 - i could change the columns
42:06 - so now there's 10 columns of text but
42:09 - we'll just go to default because we
42:10 - really just want a single column there
42:12 - and so you can just go through and and
42:15 - change all these things so we also have
42:16 - the style here so let's see if we can
42:17 - change the style so we can change the
42:19 - text color the typography
42:22 - if i choose typography i can actually
42:25 - change the size of the text so here
42:28 - i can basically make it as large or
42:30 - small
42:32 - as i want
42:37 - but i'm just going to delete if you just
42:40 - delete the number together it'll just go
42:42 - to to kind of the default size i already
42:44 - was but if you want a different size
42:47 - that's where you would change in here
42:49 - so there's just a bunch of different
42:50 - settings you can change to get the style
42:52 - exactly right for for what you're
42:54 - looking for
42:56 - and there's even some advanced settings
42:58 - so if you change the margin that's going
43:00 - to change the how much space is is above
43:03 - the text or below the text so if i
43:05 - change this if i
43:07 - make it so that values aren't linked
43:08 - together and make this go up you can see
43:10 - how there's it's getting more space on
43:13 - the right of the text i can bring that
43:15 - back to zero
43:17 - and if i do bottom i can put like 70
43:20 - here you can see it's putting more space
43:22 - on the bottom of the text but i'm just
43:24 - going to keep this at zero and there's
43:26 - all these things different things you
43:27 - can change like you can even add motion
43:30 - effects
43:31 - so this would actually add an animation
43:33 - to the text so if i do fade in you can
43:36 - see it gives an example of it fading in
43:38 - or you can make it moving
43:40 - going from the left right there
43:43 - so there's a lot of different cool
43:44 - things you can do
43:46 - to make it just unique and specific to
43:48 - what you're trying to do for your
43:50 - website
43:51 - and so let's say i want to change this
43:53 - here so contact our attorneys
43:56 - so if i click here
43:58 - you can see this is where it's linking
43:59 - to anytime you see this pound sign or
44:02 - this hashtag here that just means it's a
44:04 - placeholder link there it's not actually
44:07 - linking to anything but really we want
44:09 - it so there's two things we can make
44:10 - this link to we could either link this
44:12 - to an email address but we're going to
44:14 - link it to our contact page so our
44:17 - contact page i can actually go here
44:19 - right click
44:20 - and go to copy link address and if i
44:23 - paste this in here we can see it's
44:25 - robotfamilyreviews.comcontact
44:27 - so now when someone clicks here we'll go
44:29 - to the contact page
44:31 - but let's also change what the text
44:33 - looks like so instead of contact our
44:35 - attorneys i'm going to make it contact
44:38 - our
44:40 - reviewers
44:41 - [Music]
44:44 - okay so now when someone clicks that
44:45 - will go to the contact page and now
44:47 - let's see how we can change these
44:49 - different elements you can change some
44:51 - colors on the page by changing the
44:54 - overall styles on the page like i showed
44:56 - you earlier but some elements are
44:58 - colored individually so i can click on
45:00 - here and then go to style
45:02 - and then here i'm going to get the hex
45:06 - value that we are using on the other
45:08 - parts of the page that blue make it here
45:10 - so i'm just going to paste that that hex
45:12 - value in from that we were using before
45:14 - and you can see it's changing to this
45:16 - blue here and you can do that for any
45:19 - element so like i can click on this
45:22 - this icon here
45:24 - and i can go to style and now i'm going
45:26 - to show you an even easier way to do it
45:28 - so yes we can select the color
45:30 - individually but this time we're going
45:32 - to use the global colors so let me show
45:34 - you how we're going to set the global
45:35 - colors i'm going to manage global colors
45:37 - so so we have the colors through
45:40 - elementor and then we have the colors on
45:42 - wordpress so we already set the colors
45:44 - on wordpress now i'm going to set the
45:45 - global colors on elementor and i'm just
45:47 - going to paste in the hex value again
45:50 - so now we have this blue and for now
45:52 - we'll just leave these the same so let's
45:54 - go back here
45:56 - if i go here i'm going to save save the
45:58 - global colors
46:03 - if i click on here then i can set it as
46:05 - the primary color here
46:09 - so i can do it for all these things i
46:10 - don't know why this icon wasn't showing
46:13 - up i knew was there so i just click
46:14 - there and i can set this there again
46:17 - click on this icon which for some reason
46:19 - wasn't showing up
46:21 - and then i can go through each
46:24 - icon here and change it to the color
46:29 - the blue color we're going to use and
46:31 - then so here's another element here this
46:33 - little line right there click there
46:39 - and this time we have to go to this
46:40 - border section because it's actually
46:42 - just a border on one side
46:45 - and i can change that to the primary
46:46 - color
46:49 - okay so
46:51 - let me show you how to add a picture i
46:53 - added this placeholder picture
46:55 - and what you're going to want to do
46:58 - unless you have a lot of your own
47:00 - photography for different products
47:03 - we can go and get some royalty free
47:05 - photos that we can use right on our
47:07 - website
47:08 - there are some few a few extensions some
47:11 - a few wordpress
47:12 - extensions that you can
47:15 - install that will make this simpler to
47:16 - do right from wordpress but you can also
47:19 - just go to the royalty free websites
47:22 - yourself so one popular one is
47:24 - pexels.com
47:26 - so i'm just going to search i'm at
47:28 - pexels.com i'm going to search for a
47:29 - robot
47:32 - okay so look at all these robot pictures
47:34 - all these are royalty free that anybody
47:36 - can use so let's see which one i want to
47:39 - use i kind of like
47:45 - how about this one okay i'm gonna
47:46 - download this but instead of just
47:48 - downloading the
47:50 - original it's a little bigger than what
47:51 - we need so i'm going to go to the the
47:53 - medium size
47:55 - if it's too big it'll just take too long
47:57 - to load so i'm going to click free
47:59 - download
48:01 - and now i'll go back over to elementor
48:04 - we'll go to choose image upload files
48:07 - and then i can just drag it right into
48:09 - here
48:11 - okay all text and just you know alt text
48:14 - is what displays when people are using
48:16 - screen readers so some people may be
48:19 - accessing your website that can't see
48:21 - the image but they can use a screen
48:23 - reader to have it read out what the
48:25 - image is of so it's always important to
48:27 - include alt text so i'll put robot
48:30 - staring
48:32 - at
48:33 - camera
48:35 - or maybe at you
48:36 - okay so insert media
48:39 - and now we have a robot here
48:41 - so now let's see how we can update see
48:44 - we have this background image right here
48:45 - that we have this lady staring here so
48:48 - to update the background image we're
48:50 - going to have to update this whole
48:51 - section so i'm going to click right here
48:55 - and now that click here i have the
48:57 - editing for this box so you can see this
48:59 - blue line now surrounding this whole
49:02 - section
49:03 - and now we can change things about this
49:06 - so what i'm going to go i'm going to go
49:08 - to style now we have this image now i
49:11 - want to change this and use a different
49:13 - image so here's another cool website for
49:15 - finding free royalty free images which
49:18 - is
49:19 - unsplash.com so let me try searching for
49:22 - robots here
49:24 - okay so this now we have a whole new set
49:26 - of images we can deal with now i kind of
49:28 - like this one this is cool for a
49:29 - background image
49:30 - so i'm going to click here go to
49:32 - download i'm going to do download
49:36 - medium
49:37 - okay now i'm going to
49:40 - do choose image i'm going to upload a
49:42 - file and then i'm just going to bring in
49:44 - this image again
49:46 - and since it's just a background image
49:48 - we don't need alt text so insert that
49:49 - media
49:50 - so now we have a new image in the
49:53 - background so that's pretty
49:56 - cool i'm kind of looking at this i
49:59 - notice that there's a lot of space above
50:01 - the text there's a lot of space below
50:03 - the text that's too much space that's
50:05 - easy to switch so i'm still i'm already
50:08 - on the editing for this section because
50:10 - i click this six dot thing here and i'll
50:13 - go to layout
50:14 - so i'm on the layout tab
50:16 - and minimum height so if i make this
50:18 - height go down
50:20 - now there's going to be less space above
50:22 - and below i'm changing what the height
50:24 - of this section is so that kind of that
50:27 - looks
50:28 - a little better to me so we can get to
50:30 - the next section
50:33 - and let's change from this text so
50:35 - instead of practice areas we'll do
50:37 - our focus
50:39 - and then we're going to change these
50:40 - different sections instead of family law
50:42 - i'm going to
50:44 - we'll do stem
50:47 - [Music]
50:53 - programming
51:00 - toys
51:02 - and fun
51:05 - and then we can try to find
51:08 - not fun law then we can try to find an
51:10 - icon that goes along with each one and
51:12 - it makes it easy to change the icon so
51:13 - if i just click on this icon here
51:16 - and i go to content
51:19 - i can go to icon library
51:23 - okay for stem i will use a school icon
51:28 - for programming let's see if we can
51:30 - change this to maybe a computer
51:37 - laptop with a little code icon
51:42 - and then for toys
51:45 - content
51:47 - for toys i'm just going to scroll down
51:49 - and see oh paper airplane i like that
51:51 - for a toy
51:56 - and then for fun we'll just do a grin
51:59 - here
52:02 - okay now you may want to get rid of
52:05 - sections so like this section that
52:07 - doesn't really apply to us so we can
52:09 - actually just press x and get rid of
52:11 - this
52:13 - teams
52:14 - no
52:16 - this is something maybe we want so
52:19 - we could change this to review team
52:26 - and then you could go through and change
52:28 - i'm not going to update all these names
52:29 - but you would can you could update the
52:31 - pictures you can up
52:33 - choose the image to get pictures of
52:35 - different teammates and then we may want
52:36 - to change this text so go to style
52:42 - and then for color
52:43 - primary color and then we just go
52:45 - through each one and change the style to
52:47 - make sure it's all the color that we
52:49 - want
52:50 - basically you just want to go through
52:51 - these menus till you find the thing that
52:54 - find the setting that will change what
52:56 - you want to change
52:57 - and the great thing is pretty much
52:59 - everything can be changed
53:05 - now you can see i don't know why these
53:06 - weren't showing up but these are social
53:08 - media
53:09 - icons so let's say you want to get this
53:13 - the social media links for every person
53:16 - on your team so you go in here and you
53:18 - would just click right on here
53:21 - and then you would put the twitter like
53:23 - https
53:26 - colon slash less
53:28 - twitter.com
53:30 - carns
53:32 - and then you would do that and put the
53:33 - link for each
53:35 - each social media link for each person
53:37 - on your team you can also add new social
53:40 - media links so maybe do add item
53:42 - and
53:43 - you go to the icon library maybe you
53:46 - want to add a github link so we get that
53:48 - icon insert
53:51 - and now we have another link and then
53:53 - you would put the link right here you
53:54 - just type in the link okay so let's keep
53:57 - going down here
54:00 - this one we're just going to delete that
54:01 - section because we don't need that
54:02 - section here is another thing that we
54:04 - could change
54:06 - so like we could change this we could
54:07 - easily change the colors so styles we
54:10 - can do
54:11 - primary color and then now when you
54:14 - hover it still doesn't it doesn't stay
54:16 - blue so you're gonna have to choose
54:18 - colors two times so in the normal mode
54:20 - and the hover mode
54:22 - so that's why you have to look for these
54:25 - settings to make sure you change the
54:27 - color in every place the color needs to
54:28 - be changed so we can go through and do
54:30 - these on these other ones too
54:36 - and again you can go through and update
54:38 - this text you can update this text you
54:40 - can change the text you can
54:42 - update this link
54:43 - again it's
54:45 - so this one you may want to use your
54:47 - contact link again
54:50 - so we can update this to slash contact
54:54 - and then we can update the background
54:55 - image so just like before to upgrade the
54:58 - background image we're going to click
54:59 - here
55:01 - and then we can go to style
55:04 - and then we could choose the image we
55:05 - can
55:06 - update the image to a different image
55:08 - let me show you how you would have your
55:10 - own section like let's say this section
55:12 - is no not not like what we want i can
55:15 - get rid of that section we can get rid
55:17 - of this section but what if i want to
55:19 - add a whole new section in between here
55:23 - so what you want to do if you want to
55:24 - add a section is just click this plus
55:26 - button
55:27 - and now it's going to have an empty
55:30 - thing right here so i'm going to bring
55:32 - over an inner section
55:34 - so this intersection now has two tabs
55:37 - here or two columns i mean
55:40 - so we can add something different each
55:41 - of these columns so if it hit plus here
55:44 - let's say we want to add a video on this
55:46 - side
55:48 - and let's say we want to add
55:55 - an image
55:56 - on this side
55:57 - so let me show you how you would update
55:59 - what it what the video is so let me
56:01 - scroll over here so i have to you have
56:03 - to click this little edit button on the
56:05 - top of the corner at the video
56:07 - and so i can update this video so i'm
56:10 - going to or we can update this link i'm
56:12 - just going to paste in and now we have a
56:14 - different video we have the video we
56:16 - want to be featured here
56:18 - and then you can also do something like
56:20 - start time in time you can change the
56:21 - different source if you want the the
56:23 - video to be
56:24 - from some different location you can
56:26 - change autoplay there's all these
56:28 - different settings you can change here
56:32 - you probably want to turn on uh privacy
56:34 - mode so youtube won't store information
56:36 - about visitors on your website unless
56:37 - they play the video
56:38 - so that's just a
56:41 - nice thing to do for your visitors
56:43 - and then then with images we can change
56:46 - the image just like before so we're
56:48 - going to change the image we click on
56:50 - the image we can go to content
56:52 - and then we can choose the image so we
56:55 - can choose an image that's already on
56:57 - there this time i'm just going to make
56:58 - it simple i'm just going to
57:01 - add an image that we already have so how
57:02 - about this one
57:05 - okay and then we can even change the
57:07 - background of this whole section so if i
57:09 - click
57:11 - here
57:12 - now let's say i instead of white in the
57:14 - background i want a different color so i
57:16 - can go to style
57:17 - and then background overlay or not
57:20 - background overlay i want to go to
57:21 - background
57:23 - and then you can change the different so
57:25 - classic gradient video or slideshow so
57:28 - you can actually have a video playing in
57:30 - the background and you can get that
57:31 - video directly from youtube
57:33 - i'm going to do a gradient this time so
57:36 - the first color we're going to take a
57:39 - blue
57:40 - and then the second color we're going to
57:42 - have like a lighter blue here
57:44 - i guess it's like a black to turquoise
57:47 - and now you can see there's the gradient
57:49 - in the background
57:51 - and i'm going to actually change the you
57:53 - can change the
57:56 - the angle i'm just going to do a 90
57:58 - degree angle
58:00 - and it doesn't really look that good but
58:03 - i'm just trying to show off the
58:04 - different things you can do
58:06 - so let's delete this whole section here
58:09 - and let's say you want your your map you
58:12 - want to have a map of where you're
58:13 - located at so let me show you how you
58:15 - would change
58:16 - where it shows where it shows in the map
58:19 - so i'm going to go to this section
58:22 - and actually you may have to hit this
58:25 - edit button right up here
58:27 - and right now the location is new york
58:30 - well let's try michigan
58:33 - that's the state i live in and
58:36 - we'll zoom out a little bit
58:40 - you could also put a city or you could
58:43 - even put a
58:44 - very specific address if you wanted to
58:48 - but for now we'll just say michigan
58:51 - and let's just keep going down here so
58:53 - this is like an empty section of the
58:55 - page
58:56 - but
58:57 - this only shows up when you're editing
58:59 - when you're on your page it's not going
59:00 - to show here
59:02 - so let's just look at what our page
59:04 - looks like so far so i'm going to click
59:05 - update and then preview changes
59:08 - okay so this is what our page looks like
59:11 - so far it looks a little different and
59:13 - you can go through and see oh there's a
59:14 - few things i uh i didn't change the
59:17 - color of so let's go do that now that's
59:19 - it's you're good to preview every few
59:21 - seconds so you can er every few minutes
59:23 - to see if there's anything you still
59:24 - need to do so i want to change that
59:26 - color so let me just go to edit with
59:28 - elementor
59:32 - i'm going to change this section
59:35 - um sometimes there'll be colors in
59:36 - various places so you kind of have to
59:38 - click around so you find out the exact
59:40 - spot but for this one it was border
59:43 - and you can change the color here scroll
59:46 - down
59:47 - there's one go to border
59:50 - at this point you probably know exactly
59:52 - how to change this
59:53 - this stuff here
59:55 - style
59:59 - and to change the color of the text on
60:01 - these buttons
60:02 - is going to require some custom css
60:05 - it's not too difficult but i'm going to
60:07 - save this to show you for later
60:09 - so we're basically done updating this
60:11 - main page
60:14 - oh lawyer firm how about
60:16 - robot firm
60:18 - and we'll preview changes
60:20 - okay now let me show you how you would
60:22 - update a few different types of sections
60:24 - first i'm going to show you how to
60:26 - delete add and delete sections
60:28 - to this menu here
60:30 - and then how to
60:32 - make some changes to the news or blog
60:34 - section so this news is also similar to
60:37 - a blog so a lot of
60:39 - websites are going to have a new section
60:41 - or a blog section that's kind of a
60:43 - different type of section than the other
60:45 - sections so first let's go through and
60:47 - find out how to add and remove sections
60:49 - so right so first of all let's say you
60:51 - wanted to edit this section if you want
60:53 - to edit just like before you do edit
60:55 - with elementor
60:57 - and then you would use all the same
60:59 - types of editing that we saw before you
61:01 - can edit here
61:02 - you can add a new section you can delete
61:04 - a section or edit the whole section just
61:06 - like this before but really what we want
61:07 - to do is completely remove this section
61:11 - so let me show you how you would do that
61:13 - if there's a whole
61:15 - page in your website that you don't even
61:16 - want how would you remove that
61:19 - so first of all you would see which
61:20 - sections you want to remove well
61:23 - we don't want any of these three
61:24 - sections so i'm going to remove all the
61:27 - three of these sections and then i'm
61:29 - going to show you how to add an all new
61:32 - section so these are the type of things
61:34 - that you may want to do when you're
61:34 - developing your own website you want to
61:36 - know how to remove a page and how to add
61:39 - completely new pages so let me show you
61:41 - that to remove this you're not going to
61:44 - do it from the edit with elementor or
61:45 - the edit page we're going to have to go
61:47 - back to our dashboard
61:49 - just so you know there's two types of
61:52 - basically pages we have normal pages and
61:55 - then we have posts so posts are like our
61:58 - blog posts and you can see these are all
62:00 - some sample posts that they put in there
62:02 - and then we also have pages which is our
62:05 - different pages like we have the blog
62:07 - page
62:08 - we which is i think the news page
62:10 - contacts fact home
62:12 - practice areas so we are going to do a
62:16 - few things first of all
62:18 - we want to we're just going to remove
62:20 - some of these sections we don't need the
62:22 - attorneys page we don't we're going to
62:24 - keep the contacts page we don't need the
62:26 - fact page practice areas and we're just
62:28 - going to delete those three pages
62:31 - so
62:32 - i'm going to bulk actions and move to
62:35 - trash
62:36 - and then apply
62:38 - and click no thanks here
62:42 - okay now let's see what our page looks
62:43 - like now that those have been removed
62:45 - i'm going to visit site
62:46 - and you can see now they're not even
62:49 - showing up in here
62:51 - so
62:52 - let's see how we can now add a new page
62:55 - also i'll show you how you would remove
62:56 - a section from this menu even though you
62:59 - don't want to delete that that page from
63:01 - your website so i'll show you that first
63:03 - and then i'll show you how to add new
63:04 - ones so let's say we want to remove the
63:07 - news section from this menu here i'm
63:09 - going to go back
63:11 - well let me close some of these extra
63:12 - tabs here i'm going to go back to our
63:14 - dashboard
63:17 - and
63:18 - let's change
63:19 - the menu
63:21 - so let me go to appearance and then
63:23 - menus
63:25 - so these are how we're going to change
63:26 - the menus so i want to change the main
63:28 - menu and not the footer menu so i'll
63:29 - select that
63:32 - and so
63:33 - we're going to want to delete well it
63:35 - still has the element the page that we
63:37 - deleted so if you delete the page you
63:38 - also want to delete it off the menu so
63:40 - i'm going to do is click here
63:42 - remove
63:44 - click here
63:45 - remove
63:46 - click here
63:48 - remove
63:49 - and the same way that's how you would
63:51 - remove the news page so i could click
63:52 - here and remove now that didn't remove
63:56 - that page from our website it's just
63:59 - removed it from the menu so if i click
64:02 - save menu
64:04 - and then if i go to the site we don't
64:07 - have the news but if i go to the url and
64:10 - do slash news
64:13 - well i guess that's not what it was
64:14 - called how i think was called blog
64:17 - okay so we can still see it so here is
64:19 - the blog it's still on here even though
64:21 - we removed it from the menu so let's see
64:24 - how to add it back to the menu go back
64:26 - to the dashboard we're gonna go right
64:27 - back to where we were appearance
64:30 - and menus
64:33 - and then
64:34 - i'm going to add an item here so let's
64:36 - do view all
64:38 - i'm gonna
64:39 - select the blog
64:40 - and i'm going to add to the menu now
64:44 - this is going to be different now
64:45 - because it says blog before it said news
64:48 - so let's see how we can call it news
64:49 - instead of calling it blog we're going
64:51 - to call it news so this is going to
64:53 - change what it says right in the menu
64:55 - item but actually we don't want it to be
64:57 - called news or blog we want it to be
64:59 - called reviews because these are going
65:01 - to be our robot reviews so i'm going to
65:03 - save the menu like that and if we go
65:06 - back to the page i'll actually open up
65:08 - into a new tab this time and then we can
65:11 - see home reviews contact us so that's
65:13 - how you add or remove sections from this
65:15 - menu so now i want to show you how you
65:17 - would add an all new page
65:20 - okay so to create a
65:21 - new
65:22 - page we can just click add new and then
65:24 - we have the add new button here too so
65:26 - we're on the page section we're gonna
65:27 - click add new
65:29 - and we're gonna just give this a title
65:31 - for this example we're gonna do
65:33 - programming lessons so people who are
65:37 - really into robots can learn how to
65:39 - program robots
65:41 - how we're going to edit this after we
65:43 - get the title here we're going to go to
65:45 - this template instead of the default
65:46 - template we're going to do uh elementor
65:50 - full width you can kind of experiment
65:52 - with different things
65:53 - but the elementor full width will allow
65:56 - us to have a page without anything
65:59 - without any sidebars or anything and
66:01 - that's we're gonna do for this example
66:03 - so i'm going to click edit with
66:05 - elementor
66:08 - okay now we're editing the page and you
66:11 - can see that it still has our normal
66:14 - header and our normal fitter footer
66:17 - but we just need to add what's going to
66:19 - be in here and you can see it's going to
66:22 - have some breadcrumbs here with the home
66:24 - and the programming lessons
66:26 - and now we can just add sections here so
66:29 - if i click plus then we can just
66:32 - choose how many columns we're going to
66:34 - have
66:35 - and then you can add elements into each
66:37 - one of those columns like you could put
66:39 - pictures in one column text in another
66:41 - buttons in another video in another
66:44 - maybe a map or or maybe two columns of
66:47 - text it's really up to you what you want
66:48 - to add to each column i'm just going to
66:50 - go with the two column layout again here
66:52 - and so you can see uh we can also change
66:56 - the size of the columns so right now we
66:58 - have a small column on this side and
67:00 - then a larger column on the other side
67:03 - and it's always going to have this drag
67:05 - widget here just in case you want to add
67:07 - something to the bottom of the page
67:09 - but when we we actually preview the page
67:11 - when we see what it actually looks like
67:12 - it's not going to have this thing down
67:14 - here so let's add something to the
67:16 - column so i'm going to do is put an
67:17 - image on this side and some text on this
67:19 - side and on this side i'm going to show
67:21 - you how you can have columns inside of a
67:23 - column so here we're going to add an
67:26 - image i'm going to go back to unsplash
67:30 - and put robots
67:33 - and i'm going to grab this one the rock
67:35 - and roll monkey robot so i'm going to
67:37 - download and instead of downloading the
67:38 - largest one i'm going to go to the
67:40 - medium one
67:42 - and then we'll go back over here
67:45 - i'm gonna choose image upload files i'm
67:48 - just going to drag this over
67:51 - and then for the alt text i will put
67:55 - monkey robot kind of i guess not really
67:57 - a monkey it's
67:59 - looks some kind somewhat similar to a
68:00 - monkey
68:02 - but it was called rock and roll monkey
68:04 - so
68:05 - what i'm going to do
68:08 - is now
68:10 - put some text here so first
68:13 - i'm going to put this text editor here
68:16 - and we're going to say
68:19 - if you
68:21 - want programming
68:23 - lessons
68:24 - if you want
68:26 - robot programming lessons
68:28 - [Music]
68:30 - you come
68:32 - to the right spot
68:34 - [Music]
68:35 - here is what we offer
68:38 - and now i'm going to add another section
68:40 - down here so i'm going to
68:44 - go to insert section
68:50 - okay so now we have two columns inside
68:53 - this column
68:54 - so on this i'm going to add a heading
68:57 - and the heading is going to be
69:00 - scratch
69:01 - programming
69:03 - and then
69:04 - over here we'll have a heading
69:07 - which will be
69:09 - python programming
69:13 - and then we can just add more text in
69:15 - here so let's keep going back here to
69:17 - until we can insert a the text editor
69:20 - we're going to enter insert a text
69:21 - editor on both sides here
69:27 - and so here's where we would talk about
69:28 - the scratch program here's when we talk
69:30 - about the python programming and another
69:32 - thing you can cool thing you can do is
69:34 - if i click here
69:35 - i can go to duplicate
69:37 - and now actually i have three columns i
69:40 - just duplicated this column so we can do
69:42 - another type of programming
69:45 - maybe we can do
69:46 - javascript programming
69:51 - and then i can
69:53 - go back over here we're going to add a
69:55 - button
69:57 - the button is going to be right at the
69:59 - bottom here
70:01 - and i'm going to change this instead of
70:02 - click here it's going to say
70:04 - contact us for details
70:08 - so it's basically a call to action
70:11 - and then for that link
70:13 - i'm going to go right to the contact
70:15 - page which we are going to be developing
70:17 - pretty soon here
70:21 - okay now let me publish this
70:24 - i'm going to have a look
70:29 - okay so programming lessons
70:31 - and you can see we have two sections
70:33 - here
70:34 - and then it goes right to our footer
70:36 - down here so using this method you can
70:38 - add as many pages you want to your web
70:40 - page now we also want to make sure it's
70:42 - up here so let's add our programming
70:45 - lessons to our navigation
70:49 - so i'll go
70:50 - to our dashboard
70:52 - and then appearance menus
70:55 - and then we're on our main menu so we're
70:57 - going to add programming lessons add to
70:59 - menu now we can drag this up it's going
71:02 - to be called home
71:04 - programming license reviews contact us
71:06 - and you can also have sub menus by
71:09 - this becomes a sub menu if i pull over
71:12 - but we went all on the root level so
71:15 - i'll save the menu and then let's visit
71:17 - the site
71:19 - okay so here's the home page
71:26 - and obviously we still have to would
71:28 - have to kind of update some of this text
71:30 - i'm not going to go through and update
71:32 - all the text but you can't get the idea
71:34 - of how to update all this text here
71:37 - and if we go to programming lessons
71:41 - so here's that
71:43 - and
71:44 - all looks good
71:45 - now the next two things we're going to
71:47 - do we're going to update this reviews
71:49 - page or the blog page we're going to
71:51 - update the contact page and then after
71:55 - that
71:55 - yeah this isn't working at all after
71:57 - that we're going to update the footer
71:59 - let's go to the reviews page here so
72:01 - first of all some people that make a
72:04 - website they want to only be a blog they
72:06 - may want this blog page with their
72:08 - different posts like this to appear
72:11 - as their home page when someone first
72:13 - goes to their website so let me show you
72:15 - how to do that we'll go to the dashboard
72:18 - okay so how to make the blog as your
72:20 - main page we're going to go to settings
72:22 - and then reading
72:25 - and then we would set the home page as
72:27 - your latest post so let me just show you
72:29 - what that would look like if we set that
72:32 - as your uac post i'll go here go to the
72:34 - page again
72:35 - okay now if we go to our url up here
72:37 - we're at the root url there's no slash
72:40 - or anything after it and you can see
72:42 - it's the blog posts
72:44 - but let's turn that back so we'll go
72:47 - again we'll go to
72:48 - settings
72:50 - reading
72:52 - and then we'll do static page
72:55 - now now we're going to set this again so
72:57 - our main page our homepage is going to
72:59 - be home and our post page is going to be
73:02 - blog and here's how you can actually
73:05 - change a little bit what your blog your
73:07 - your blog page is going to look like so
73:09 - you can check choose how many blogs are
73:12 - going to show up on each page
73:16 - you can show freeze posts in the feed is
73:18 - it going to be the full text or summary
73:21 - uh if you want to discourage search
73:22 - engines from indexing the site
73:24 - usually you're going to want this off
73:25 - because most people want it to appear in
73:27 - search engines but if for some reason
73:28 - you don't you can click that so let's
73:30 - save changes and now let's see how we
73:33 - can update our blog page
73:36 - so the blog page is a special type of
73:39 - page that the way you change the layout
73:41 - it's a little different than the other
73:42 - pages so we're going to go to appearance
73:45 - and then customize
73:50 - then we'll go to blog
73:53 - and then the blog entries
73:55 - so we're going to change what the blog
73:56 - entries page looks like
73:59 - and there actually is a different way to
74:00 - do that if we didn't have this up and
74:02 - let's say we are on our site if we go to
74:06 - reviews and then we can just click
74:08 - customize here
74:10 - and then it should open that up that
74:12 - screen up where we were just at
74:14 - okay and then we'll still have to go to
74:16 - blog
74:17 - blog entries
74:19 - and this is where we can
74:20 - change what this is going to look like
74:22 - so right now we have it with the right
74:24 - sidebar you can't really see it now i'm
74:27 - actually going to change the zoom level
74:29 - on chrome here
74:31 - okay so now you can see the sidebar here
74:37 - and this is where we're going to
74:39 - actually edit you can edit those
74:40 - different sections so right now we're
74:42 - not using elementor at all we're using
74:44 - the default wordpress editor to edit
74:47 - this blog page you can't edit this
74:49 - section with elementor
74:51 - so here is where we can
74:54 - make any edits we want so one thing we
74:56 - can do is go to left sidebar and it just
74:59 - switches the sidebar to the other side
75:01 - but let's keep right right sidebar and
75:04 - then it says this is mobile sidebar
75:07 - order that means if you're on a mobile
75:09 - device there's these buttons down here
75:11 - so you can switch to different types of
75:13 - view this is like a tablet view this is
75:15 - like a mobile view here so
75:18 - if we change this
75:20 - so now it's going to show the sidebar
75:23 - first and then it's going to show the
75:25 - content or we want to show the content
75:28 - first and then the sidebar because on a
75:30 - mobile device you're not going to be
75:31 - able to show both the content and the
75:33 - sidebar at the same time so it's going
75:35 - to put one after the other so that's
75:37 - what this is all about
75:39 - and this would change the size of these
75:41 - headings but it doesn't work for this
75:43 - particular theme that we're using
75:46 - let's go back to desktop view
75:50 - but you can also change the style so
75:53 - large image okay we can also do grid
75:57 - or we can do thumbnail
76:00 - so it's up to you what you want your
76:02 - main page to look like i actually kind
76:04 - of like this i like thumbnail and then
76:06 - you can change where's the image is it
76:07 - going to be right or left
76:11 - you can change the vertical position
76:13 - so you can see there's a lot of
76:14 - different settings you can change on
76:16 - here pagination style so we have the
76:18 - pages down here so we could change it to
76:21 - infinite scroll so just keep
76:24 - uh loading more and more blog posts
76:27 - until you get to the end of content
76:29 - which is i guess we're at the end of
76:30 - content now so let's go back to
76:32 - standard we can also delete anything
76:35 - over here that we don't want so for
76:37 - instance i don't want this calendar i'll
76:38 - just click here
76:41 - and then i can go to remove
76:44 - and then we're not gonna hook up with
76:46 - instagram so i can remove that
76:50 - but if you wanted to you could just go
76:51 - into the settings in there
76:53 - we'll keep the recent comments recent
76:55 - post and
76:57 - actually we have this
76:59 - twice here i don't know if we need all
77:00 - this so let's just make sure we only
77:02 - have everything one time so right now
77:06 - you have somehow got the recent post
77:08 - recent comments recent post reason
77:09 - comments that's a little too many so i
77:12 - can just remove that
77:14 - we can remove this
77:17 - and then if we edit this recent post you
77:19 - can still change things like instead of
77:21 - doing uh three posts let's show the five
77:24 - most recent posts and there's a bunch of
77:26 - other settings you can change to make
77:28 - this look exactly like you want
77:30 - but this looks pretty good
77:33 - so the next thing i want to show you is
77:35 - how someone can
77:36 - how you can load create new blog posts
77:40 - so
77:41 - let's publish this
77:43 - so to make new blog posts there's two
77:45 - ways if you're in this screen right here
77:47 - you can just click new and then suddenly
77:49 - you're creating a new blog post just
77:51 - like that
77:52 - and if you're already over here you can
77:53 - click add new here
77:56 - and i'm going to minimize this because
77:57 - we don't want to be looking at these
77:59 - settings all the time you can go into
78:00 - those settings to customize exactly
78:02 - again what everything looks like
78:04 - but we don't need to be looking at those
78:05 - settings
78:06 - so uh we're going to be reviewing
78:08 - different robots so if let's say we're
78:10 - going to review the cosmo robot
78:17 - this is a great robot
78:21 - and just like before now we we could
78:23 - edit with elementor but personally i
78:25 - think for blog post
78:27 - it's good to i would just recommend
78:29 - using the default editor just to make
78:32 - everything look consistent you want all
78:33 - the blog posts to look
78:35 - very consistent between the different
78:37 - blog posts and using the built-in editor
78:39 - instead of elementor is one way to make
78:41 - things uh look consistent and the
78:43 - built-in editor is great for just doing
78:45 - text or just doing blog posts where
78:47 - elementor is good for like moving around
78:49 - different things on the page so we're
78:50 - gonna use just this built-in editor but
78:52 - just like and with elementor you can
78:54 - still add a bunch of stuff like i can
78:56 - click this plus button here
78:58 - i can add a form i can add an image
78:59 - heading a gallery so i'm going to add a
79:01 - gallery so in a gallery i can actually
79:05 - pick a lot of different images so let's
79:07 - say just we could
79:09 - upload more images but i'm just going to
79:11 - select these to show as an example
79:14 - and i'll do insert gallery so you could
79:17 - potentially like have a bunch of images
79:19 - of cosmo robot and then you would show
79:23 - this in a gallery you can also insert a
79:24 - single image there's a bunch of
79:26 - different things you can insert
79:28 - and you can do browse all so you can
79:30 - actually these are all the different
79:31 - things you can put a quote you can put a
79:33 - table
79:34 - you can put a verse
79:37 - like poetry with special format a quote
79:40 - so there's a bunch of different types of
79:42 - things that you can enter insert right
79:44 - into your post so let's say i'm done i'm
79:47 - going to click publish and publish
79:52 - okay now i'll view the post
79:56 - okay here's my blog post so
79:59 - it says cosmo robot review this is the
80:02 - great robot and then you can see this
80:04 - gallery here and then people can leave a
80:06 - comment here now if i go to um now if i
80:10 - go to reviews it shows up as the first
80:12 - review but i noticed a few things one
80:14 - there's no image like these other ones
80:17 - and
80:18 - it's uncategorized usually you'll have
80:22 - a group that this is under so let's go
80:24 - back to the post i'll go in here and
80:26 - then i can just go to edit post
80:29 - okay i'm going to go to categories and
80:32 - then i'm going to add a new category
80:34 - this category is going to be called
80:35 - review reviews
80:40 - and then add new category and now it's
80:42 - going to be under reviews instead of
80:44 - uncategorized so the default is
80:46 - uncategorized but we may want to be
80:47 - called reviews
80:49 - so
80:50 - now and you basically can add as many
80:51 - categories as you want and you can
80:54 - put each blog post into whatever
80:57 - categories you want you can also use
80:59 - tags but we're going to use the feature
81:02 - featured image okay i'll go to set
81:04 - featured image and make sure you're on
81:06 - upload files and then i'll drag this in
81:08 - here
81:10 - and this actually is a picture of cosmo
81:13 - up a cosmo front because it's the front
81:15 - of them set featured image
81:18 - okay i will update this
81:20 - and then i'm gonna go down here view
81:22 - post
81:26 - okay cosmo robot review and it's under
81:28 - reviews this is a great post
81:31 - and then people can leave replies here
81:33 - and then if i go to reviews
81:36 - we can see
81:38 - that it appears at the top of this list
81:40 - here
81:41 - okay let's go into this review let's say
81:43 - you want to change the format or like
81:45 - what your blog post displays like we can
81:47 - go to customize here
81:50 - i go to blog and then single post
81:54 - and you can adjust things like for
81:56 - instance i can
81:58 - decide whether the feature image is
82:00 - before after the title maybe i want to
82:02 - move the title above the feature image
82:05 - okay so now it says cosmo robot review
82:07 - and then we have an image i kind of
82:10 - liked it how how it was
82:14 - and you can even like let's say you
82:16 - don't want this meta
82:17 - you don't want this information right
82:19 - here i can just take this off
82:22 - okay now we don't need to see like when
82:24 - it was posted
82:26 - and who created it
82:28 - or you may not want to show tags i don't
82:30 - have any tags but at the bottom would
82:32 - show tags if there were tags
82:35 - but one thing we you may want to do is
82:37 - decide
82:38 - which meta information shows up like for
82:40 - instance maybe you don't want to show
82:42 - the categories down here i'm going to
82:43 - take off categories
82:45 - so now we don't need to know it was
82:47 - reviews
82:48 - and maybe you probably maybe you don't
82:50 - want to show how many comments there are
82:53 - okay you just want to show the author
82:55 - and then
82:57 - the date
82:58 - or maybe you don't even want to show the
83:00 - author maybe everything is going to be
83:02 - created by the same person so you don't
83:04 - need to show who the author was for each
83:06 - post remember the author that's how we i
83:09 - showed you how to create different
83:10 - accounts so the author is whatever
83:13 - account made that post
83:15 - okay let's call this good there's a lot
83:17 - more settings you can do if you want but
83:20 - i'm just going to publish this
83:23 - okay now while we're looking at this if
83:25 - you were going to use this as your real
83:28 - page you wouldn't want all these sample
83:31 - articles there's all these sample blog
83:33 - posts and there's all these sample
83:34 - comments just so you can see what it's
83:36 - going to look like you're not going to
83:38 - want those sample
83:39 - articles and comments and blog posts
83:41 - when you actually go live with your
83:43 - website so let's see how to remove those
83:45 - i'll go to the dashboard and i'll go to
83:47 - posts and then i'm just going to select
83:49 - all the posts except i'm going to
83:51 - unselect the one they just created and
83:53 - now bulk actions and move to trash so
83:56 - these are all just the demo posts
84:00 - and then we can do the same thing with
84:01 - the comments let's go to comments
84:03 - and actually the comments just got
84:05 - automatically deleted because they were
84:06 - already associated with those blog posts
84:09 - that we just deleted
84:11 - so we don't even have to delete the
84:12 - comments anymore
84:17 - and now let's go to our site just let's
84:20 - see what it looks like right now if i
84:21 - click on reviews or just one there's no
84:23 - recent comments and there's zero
84:25 - comments on this one
84:26 - so you can go and see what that looks
84:28 - like
84:29 - good and people could leave a comment
84:32 - maybe i'll leave a comment right now
84:34 - this is a great
84:37 - post
84:39 - now you may not want people to be able
84:42 - to leave a post or leave leave a comment
84:44 - so let me show you how you would turn
84:46 - off comments completely on your posts
84:50 - i'm gonna go to customize here
84:52 - then we'll go to blog
84:54 - single post
84:56 - we go down here
84:58 - and then i can just hide comments so now
85:01 - nobody's going to be able to comment
85:03 - nobody's going to be able to
85:05 - see account see comments or leave a
85:07 - comment
85:08 - so now we just don't even have to worry
85:09 - about comments if you're going to do
85:11 - that you're probably going to want to
85:12 - remove this section here recent comments
85:15 - so let's just remove that so we don't
85:17 - show the recent comments let's publish
85:21 - okay and let's just do a preview again
85:24 - so here's reviews it's not going to show
85:26 - recent comments let's see if we can
85:27 - search for something
85:30 - so i searched for a robot and it came up
85:32 - with all the pages have robot not just
85:34 - the blog post but also the other pages
85:36 - so that's pretty nice
85:37 - okay so now we are going to figure out
85:40 - how to update this contact us page
85:44 - i'm just gonna go to edit with elementor
85:47 - and so just like before to update the
85:48 - map i'm gonna click this here i'm gonna
85:51 - type in michigan
85:53 - and then i'm going to zoom out a little
85:55 - bit here
85:58 - looks nice and you can put in an exact
86:00 - address if you want
86:02 - you could also just delete this whole
86:04 - section if you just right click on here
86:06 - i could go to delete down here
86:09 - but we're not going to do that so now
86:12 - what you're going to want to do is just
86:13 - change the colors here so go to style
86:16 - and then
86:17 - primary and then obviously you would
86:19 - change your the address to be your
86:20 - address so we could change this style
86:24 - to primary
86:26 - and then these hours we can change this
86:28 - to primary
86:31 - or you may not want these at all you may
86:33 - want a contact form on this page
86:36 - so we're going to add a contact form
86:38 - right now where people can fill that out
86:41 - and then send an email to you so let me
86:43 - put a plus here
86:45 - and this is wp form just going to drag
86:47 - this in
86:49 - okay it says you can use wp forms to
86:51 - build a contact form surveys payment
86:53 - forms and more with just a few clicks
86:54 - let's create a form
86:56 - you can create it for completely from
86:58 - scratch or start with the template i'm
87:00 - just going to use simple contact form
87:04 - okay
87:05 - name first name last name email
87:08 - commenter message let's say you also
87:10 - want to drop down
87:12 - and the drop down let's say it's going
87:14 - to be
87:15 - subject
87:16 - and then you have a few different
87:18 - choices maybe it can be
87:20 - robot review
87:24 - programming
87:27 - lessons
87:30 - site
87:32 - suggestion
87:35 - or
87:36 - other
87:38 - okay we can decide if it's going to be
87:40 - required or not we'll make this not
87:41 - required
87:43 - that looks pretty good so we have the
87:45 - name field the email the subject and the
87:48 - comment or message and then there's a
87:50 - submit form
87:52 - okay if we go to settings and then we go
87:54 - to confirmations
87:56 - we can
87:57 - put what's going to happen once someone
87:59 - submits the message so thanks for
88:01 - contacting us
88:03 - robots
88:04 - [Music]
88:07 - are amazing
88:14 - then we'll do oops not add new
88:15 - confirmation we're just going to use
88:16 - this one confirmation and then we'll
88:18 - save this
88:20 - i will go out of this
88:22 - we got this form so now the form is
88:25 - right on the page so what's going to
88:27 - happen when you click submit well it's
88:29 - going to send an email to whatever email
88:31 - you have set up
88:33 - in your settings in your wordpress
88:35 - settings so let me show you how you
88:37 - would confirm that let's see how you
88:39 - would confirm your wordpress settings so
88:42 - let me
88:43 - update
88:44 - click update button down here
88:46 - now preview changes we'll just see what
88:48 - the form looks like really quick first
88:51 - so here's the form you can select the
88:53 - subject let's go to our dashboard
88:58 - then what settings general
89:01 - okay so we have the email address bo
89:05 - freecodecamp.org
89:07 - so this email address should get a an
89:10 - email if someone fills out the form
89:12 - let's test that
89:15 - i'm going to go to contact us
89:19 - and i'm going to put
89:22 - name quincy
89:24 - larson
89:26 - quincy
89:28 - at free code camp
89:31 - dot org
89:33 - i'll do site suggestion
89:38 - update your footer
89:41 - and i'll click submit
89:44 - okay thanks for contacting us robots are
89:46 - amazing okay let me go into my email and
89:48 - see if i can find that email
89:50 - and here's the email now it did get
89:53 - marked as potential spam but since i
89:55 - basically had it sent to myself i know
89:57 - it's not a spam so you can say look safe
89:59 - and you can see name email subject and
90:02 - then the command message update your
90:04 - footer oh that's a good idea quincy
90:06 - thanks i should update the footer
90:08 - okay so that worked we can now our
90:10 - contact form works
90:12 - okay let's go back to our page
90:15 - so now that we have the contact form
90:17 - let's go back to edit with elementor
90:20 - first i don't want to deal with people
90:21 - calling me or actually coming to my
90:23 - house or anything
90:24 - so this contact page i just want to have
90:27 - the contact form so i'm going to delete
90:29 - this section so now i'll just have the
90:31 - map and then the contact form and that's
90:35 - pretty good so let's take quincy's
90:37 - suggestion and update the footer now
90:41 - but we're going to also update this
90:42 - little header too i'm going to show you
90:43 - how to update this line up here and then
90:46 - the footer down here okay so let's first
90:48 - preview
90:50 - okay and now to update this header here
90:53 - and then we'll update the footer we're
90:55 - going to go to customize
90:57 - okay so this thing right here is called
90:59 - the top bar and this part right here is
91:00 - called the header and so we can update
91:02 - the top bar or the header let's so let's
91:03 - go to top bar go to general
91:08 - and we could just disable it completely
91:09 - that's maybe one thing we want to do
91:12 - disable the top bar i kind of think that
91:14 - looks good like that we don't really
91:15 - need to show a phone number or these
91:18 - social icons but let's say you do want
91:19 - to
91:20 - show them so let's go to enable top bar
91:22 - and then we can see well do we want to
91:24 - hide it on mobile or hide on tablet or
91:26 - just show on all devices we can change
91:28 - the colors we can change different
91:30 - colors different paddings but let's go
91:32 - back here for the content and right now
91:35 - the content is call us at this phone
91:37 - number
91:38 - but maybe you want some sort of call to
91:40 - action
91:42 - like check
91:44 - out our new programming
91:47 - lessons
91:49 - and then let's say we want to change
91:50 - these social icons at the end
91:53 - you could just disable them completely
91:57 - or we can able them and just enable just
92:00 - have certain ones
92:03 - so you can see there's all these options
92:06 - and if you put a hash mark that's just
92:08 - an empty link if you if you don't have
92:10 - anything it won't show up on here so
92:13 - let's we're not going to have skype
92:15 - we won't have linkedin
92:17 - we won't have instagram let's say we
92:19 - only want twitter and youtube
92:22 - so now it's just twitter and youtube and
92:24 - we can actually just put our twitter
92:26 - page we can put our youtube page right
92:29 - here whatever we type in here like if i
92:31 - say https
92:33 - colon slash slash youtube.com
92:37 - freecodecamp
92:42 - and let's say publish
92:48 - and we'll put that so now if you click
92:51 - here the youtube button so now it opens
92:53 - up the free codecamp youtube channel
92:55 - let's close that
92:57 - okay so now we know how to update this
92:59 - and then i already kind of showed you
93:01 - how to update this
93:03 - header i just showed you where you would
93:04 - click but let me just show you a few of
93:06 - the options you can do for that
93:10 - so click header
93:11 - we can change the height
93:15 - we can
93:17 - change the background color
93:19 - maybe you want it darker but we'll just
93:21 - go back to default
93:22 - wait
93:24 - default
93:25 - and then there's just a bunch of other
93:26 - things you can change here and just
93:28 - making the you can change update your
93:30 - logo
93:31 - the menu
93:33 - the mobile menu because when it's a
93:36 - mobile device is going to look different
93:38 - so i already kind of showed you that
93:41 - but yeah you can click mobile i'll show
93:43 - you what it's going to look like when
93:44 - you're when it's a mobile device
93:47 - and
93:48 - you can click the menu and that's what
93:50 - the menu is going to look like as a
93:51 - mobile device
93:53 - okay let's go back to this okay so we
93:55 - know about editing the top bar the menu
93:58 - now let's go down to the footer here
94:00 - there's a lot of stuff in that footer a
94:02 - lot of stuff we're not actually going to
94:04 - need
94:06 - so there's two sections there's this
94:07 - section which are called the footer
94:09 - widgets
94:11 - and then there's this copier this bottom
94:13 - bar called footer bottom
94:16 - so let's update the footer bottom first
94:19 - it's just going to say
94:20 - copyright and you may not want to say
94:22 - oceanwp theme by nick maybe you just
94:24 - want to take that off
94:26 - maybe we just want copyright
94:29 - 2001.
94:33 - and then these links down here are going
94:35 - to be the footer menu which i'll show
94:37 - you later but we got this footer bottom
94:41 - updated and you may want to update the
94:43 - footer
94:44 - widgets so here we can update the color
94:47 - and everything and some general things
94:49 - but another what thing you can do is
94:51 - just click on this like you may not have
94:54 - a newsletter
94:55 - so this is set up if you do have a
94:57 - newsletter you can actually set up to
94:59 - work with mailchimp now it takes a
95:01 - little bit of a bit more setup
95:03 - and for now it's it's kind of outside
95:05 - what we want to do so i'm going to
95:07 - remove that
95:08 - we already have our social at the top we
95:10 - don't need them at the bottom so let's
95:12 - just remove the social
95:14 - it works the same way as
95:16 - the stuff at the top
95:18 - and now i don't think we need this
95:19 - practice areas too so we just want to
95:20 - have the contact us we just want about
95:23 - us and the contact info so i'm going to
95:25 - remove this again and now we just have
95:27 - these two columns but it kind of looks
95:30 - weird that they're squished so let's
95:32 - make these so they fill up the whole
95:34 - thing so let's go back to the footer
95:36 - actually wait footer footer widgets
95:39 - and i'm gonna do two columns there
95:42 - should only be two columns here
95:45 - okay we have two columns we're not
95:47 - seeing both columns so what we can do
95:49 - actually is go to the widgets section
95:51 - here
96:18 - okay let's go to footer widgets and
96:20 - let's do
96:24 - we have three columns here
96:26 - we just want two columns
96:51 - you
98:01 - so we're gonna go to two columns here
98:04 - and looks like we lost one so to get
98:06 - that back we're gonna go to widgets
98:09 - footer two we'll see footer one is how
98:11 - we would update the about us let me show
98:13 - you that and then we'll add the second
98:14 - one back so this is how you would update
98:17 - the about us you can say
98:19 - we write
98:20 - the best robot reviews
98:24 - and you can update this
98:27 - check out our
98:30 - reviews
98:33 - see this p just means paragraph the
98:34 - beginning of the paragraph to enter the
98:36 - paragraph the beginning of the paragraph
98:37 - to enter the paragraph and now you can
98:39 - see a means anchor tag or it's just a
98:42 - link so first footer so this is a link
98:45 - and then this is the second link
98:48 - the link goes nothing we don't have an
98:49 - about us page so we're going to take
98:51 - this whole
98:53 - section off
98:55 - and then we're just going to have the
98:56 - contact us page and again we're going to
98:58 - go to the same page we keep going to so
99:01 - that would be
99:02 - robotfamilyreviews.com contact
99:06 - so now this button will go to the
99:07 - contact page
99:11 - okay i'll click done
99:14 - and then we'll add the second footer
99:16 - section and i can do add widget now i
99:18 - can there's all these different things
99:20 - you can add as the widget
99:22 - an image gallery
99:24 - a page
99:27 - calendar
99:28 - audio twitter but we're going to add a
99:31 - contact info
99:33 - for the widget
99:36 - and you can see that it has all this
99:38 - information here but it's not showing up
99:41 - if you just change something in here
99:43 - like i could say
99:47 - contact
99:48 - us today
99:50 - then it's going to show up sometimes you
99:52 - just have to change the text to make it
99:54 - show up
99:55 - and then you can update the street the
99:57 - phone so we can actually modify some of
100:00 - this stuff like we don't need so many
100:02 - phone numbers we're just
100:04 - so let's say we only want the mobile
100:05 - phone number so we can just basically if
100:08 - you just delete
100:09 - everything here
100:11 - it will go away and so we don't want
100:13 - facts
100:14 - i don't know if there's too many people
100:16 - that use fax anymore
100:20 - and then we can
100:23 - keep the email address
100:27 - which is going to be bo
100:29 - at free
100:30 - codecamp.org
100:34 - and then we just duplicate that
100:36 - and website well where are people
100:38 - already on the website so we don't need
100:39 - to share that there
100:44 - okay and you could change the address
100:46 - too and then we have these this button
100:49 - here now for skype we don't want that
100:54 - and that's what we want so i'm gonna
100:56 - click publish up here
100:58 - okay and i can close this
101:01 - and we got our website
101:04 - so now i'm just going to show you how
101:05 - you change this menu down here
101:09 - so to do that we have to go
101:11 - into our dashboard
101:13 - then we'll go to appearance
101:15 - and then we'll go to menus
101:19 - and then we go to footer menu
101:22 - select
101:24 - now
101:25 - you so you can change which links
101:28 - you have here so let's say what if i
101:30 - want my programming lessons in here i
101:32 - can add that to the menu here
101:35 - and then if i can actually just delete
101:38 - some of these other things so remove
101:42 - remove
101:45 - remove
101:48 - and if you didn't want to remove it you
101:49 - can just change it you would have to
101:51 - update the url and then what the label
101:53 - is
101:55 - but i'll just save the menu and let's
101:57 - see what it looks like with just that
101:58 - one item so i'm gonna go to the site
102:04 - and you can see it just says programming
102:06 - lessons
102:07 - that looks kind of weird so
102:09 - let's just remove the menu altogether
102:12 - and then i'll show you how to update
102:14 - this this should show like an up arrow
102:16 - if because it navigates to the top of
102:18 - the page
102:19 - but right now it's just a
102:21 - box here but let's remove that menu
102:23 - first so i'm just going to
102:25 - go to the dashboard
102:27 - close these extra tabs
102:29 - and then i'll go to appearance menus
102:33 - and
102:36 - i'm just going to delete the menu
102:40 - and then save that let me go back to the
102:43 - site
102:46 - okay now we don't have the menu and then
102:48 - let's update the copyright notice
102:51 - copyright 2001.
102:54 - i think i typed that in earlier
102:56 - incorrectly so i can go to customize
102:59 - a footer bottom
103:01 - and then that should be
103:03 - copyright 2000
103:08 - 21. now let's change with this button we
103:12 - this i said we get back to this where we
103:14 - change that button so it's blue there
103:17 - so i've already showed you a few places
103:18 - where you can update colors
103:20 - and if you see something on your page in
103:22 - your theme and you cannot figure out how
103:26 - you can change the color of that item
103:29 - it could be in the custom css js tab so
103:33 - if you go here this is a little tricky
103:35 - to update because you are going to need
103:37 - to know a little bit about css but
103:40 - you don't have to know a lot you may be
103:43 - able to figure this out and if you don't
103:44 - want to even bother with it you can
103:46 - always just delete this button and we
103:47 - don't even need a button in the about us
103:49 - page but
103:50 - if you really want to try to figure out
103:52 - how you can change this you can look for
103:55 - some comments so anything like this is a
103:57 - comment
103:58 - and we can see this says button in the
104:00 - footer so we know this is probably
104:02 - something that's going to change any
104:04 - buttons that are in the footer and then
104:06 - remember we know that the anything that
104:08 - looks like this these are colors these
104:09 - are the hex colors that we saw before
104:12 - and you can see oh color and then it has
104:14 - this so what i'm going to do is just
104:17 - paste in that blue color from before we
104:19 - have this hack so i'm just going to
104:20 - paste in that color
104:22 - and then it changes to the right color
104:25 - so we can click publish
104:26 - and that worked
104:28 - so i'm going to go back
104:31 - and the last thing i need to do is
104:33 - update this thing right here this should
104:35 - be an arrow
104:36 - okay so to update this we're going to go
104:38 - to general options then scroll to top
104:42 - and then we're just going to select what
104:43 - we want to look like
104:45 - and so i'm just going to create this two
104:47 - arrows but you can also ch there's a lot
104:49 - of other settings you can change on that
104:52 - and then you can also turn it off if you
104:53 - don't like it you can just turn off the
104:55 - button and actually you think i think
104:57 - i'm just going to go with turning it off
104:58 - completely then i'll go with publish
105:01 - and then this let's test out the site
105:05 - okay
105:07 - obviously there's more things we can
105:08 - update but
105:10 - i think you really know everything for
105:12 - all the things you have to do to update
105:14 - the site
105:15 - okay we've reached the end you should
105:18 - now know how to create your own
105:19 - wordpress website and customize it to
105:22 - meet your needs
