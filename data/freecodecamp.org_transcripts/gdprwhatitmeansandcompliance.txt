00:00 - my name's anna and i'm working for a
00:02 - small company called hiring herb and
00:04 - it's been a topic of conversation for us
00:06 - for a while especially being a very
00:07 - small development team and not
00:09 - necessarily having uh much budget or
00:12 - resources to try and even kind of
00:14 - understand it and then deal with what we
00:15 - needed to do for gdpr
00:18 - so
00:18 - just quickly hiring hub we're building a
00:21 - kind of recruitment marketplace platform
00:23 - which joins kind of uh rated reviews
00:26 - agencies
00:28 - to employers so there's quite a lot of
00:30 - data that's kind of processed within us
00:32 - within our site as well
00:35 - so i joined as cto
00:37 - uh
00:38 - end of last year and um i don't know
00:41 - really what that means yet i guess but
00:43 - i'm a bit of everything from desktop
00:45 - support to product development
00:47 - to
00:48 - wordpress developers my most recent job
00:50 - title
00:51 - and facilities all sorts of different
00:54 - things um and then there's my favorite
00:56 - favorite responsibility which is
00:58 - information security manager as well
01:01 - so i don't know for those of you who
01:03 - remember
01:04 - me from on the beach i've got really bad
01:07 - timing when it comes to compliance
01:08 - issues in this role because i literally
01:11 - got landed this job title as well uh
01:13 - when it was pci dss so all the kind of
01:15 - credit card stuff as well
01:18 - so i just start here and then my boss
01:20 - goes oh i've heard of this thing gdpr do
01:22 - you know what it means i'm like oh no
01:26 - i'll find out
01:27 - and so that's what we've been doing for
01:29 - a while
01:31 - um okay so
01:33 - what does it stand for
01:35 - so it's the general data protection
01:36 - regulation and effectively it's the same
01:39 - as the data protection act of 19 let me
01:42 - just check the date
01:43 - 98
01:46 - and effectively
01:48 - there's a lot of similar kind of
01:49 - principles in there all the underlying
01:51 - principles are the same
01:53 - now does anybody know what the
01:54 - principles are you want to take a guess
01:56 - how many do you reckon there are
01:59 - six
02:01 - oh not bad
02:05 - not bad now this is a this is cue stolen
02:08 - slide because obviously my slides are
02:10 - just text but this one's a bit more
02:11 - wizzy so i stole this
02:13 - but there's seven principles um
02:17 - and
02:17 - six of them existed previously
02:20 - so making sure that you know the data
02:23 - was fair and lawful that you were
02:24 - holding that you had a real purpose for
02:27 - the data that you were holding you know
02:29 - i want a job so you know it's you know
02:31 - it's reasonable that i'm holding you
02:33 - know i'm giving my cv to somebody and
02:34 - they're storing it um that you'd keep
02:37 - the minimum amount of data that you
02:39 - might need for that purpose that you try
02:41 - and keep it up to date when you're
02:42 - processing it that you'd always keep it
02:44 - confidential and secure
02:46 - and that you'd limit the forms that
02:48 - you'd keep it in that would be
02:50 - identifiable but what's different with
02:52 - the seventh principle is they've really
02:54 - added some accountability and liability
02:56 - across the whole
02:58 - spectrum as well
03:00 - which means that um people are really
03:02 - looking to kind of tighten up on
03:04 - everything you know there's potential
03:06 - fines now and reputational damage as
03:08 - well
03:09 - um that comes from that so that's why
03:14 - you know we're getting all these gdpr
03:16 - emails because people are kind of
03:17 - panicking a little about it
03:20 - and trying to understand what do we do
03:22 - what does it what does it mean
03:26 - so what um what does it apply to so it
03:29 - applies to any personal data that can
03:31 - reasonably identify an individual
03:34 - so all of these are you know perfect
03:36 - examples of things that that could
03:37 - include but one thing that i learned is
03:39 - that it's not just personal data from a
03:41 - consumer perspective it's also personal
03:43 - data from
03:45 - a company or work perspective as well
03:47 - so
03:48 - my work email address and that's held by
03:51 - a supplier of us for example would be in
03:53 - scope for this as well
03:57 - okay so what did this mean for a hiring
03:59 - hub
04:00 - or at least for our
04:02 - small small team
04:04 - so we figured out that there's two main
04:07 - areas where we had data and that we had
04:09 - to look after it so we were controllers
04:12 - of our customer data and that was our
04:14 - agency and supplier user data
04:17 - our supplier data and our employee data
04:20 - so that was data that we actually owned
04:22 - and we had consent from people
04:24 - either you know because they worked for
04:26 - us
04:27 - and to use their na number for um for
04:30 - the purposes of payroll for example
04:33 - or through terms of business that agency
04:36 - had given us their details so that we
04:38 - could contact them and phone them for
04:39 - the purposes of the business of engaging
04:41 - in our kind of services
04:43 - um and mainly that kind of around email
04:46 - phone number address national insurance
04:48 - number bank details those things
04:51 - then we had also figured out that we
04:52 - were a processor for some data so we
04:55 - didn't own it so an agency would put
04:57 - forward a cv within our platform
04:59 - they might put forward some details for
05:01 - a telephone interview on our platform
05:03 - but we effectively didn't own that
05:05 - candidate data at all but we had to
05:07 - ensure that the controller of that data
05:11 - had consent in order to process that
05:13 - data on our system
05:15 - as well
05:17 - so
05:18 - that's our small team we've got four of
05:20 - us um sorry for my cheesy grin and as
05:23 - you could tell it was a bit of a last uh
05:25 - it was taken today i don't wear that
05:27 - t-shirt this t-shirt ever every day
05:29 - um so yeah what does it really mean for
05:32 - us like i mentioned before we're really
05:33 - small team a really small budget and
05:35 - like with any kind of startup business
05:37 - you really before you invest in kind of
05:39 - shoring up and maturing certain things
05:41 - you probably need to spend some money
05:42 - making sure that you've got a viable
05:44 - business um and
05:46 - security and gdp haven't been budgeted
05:48 - for in our funding
05:50 - at all so um so what did we do
05:54 - so we educated ourselves um pretty
05:57 - cheaply you know we didn't uh although
06:00 - initially i kind of panicked and we were
06:02 - speaking to a few consultants about what
06:03 - did it mean
06:04 - at you know 1200 pounds a day i thought
06:07 - we can we can find out a little bit more
06:09 - about this we don't think that we need a
06:10 - consultant so i have been to most gdpr
06:13 - events in manchester and some other
06:15 - cities
06:16 - especially if they've got free food and
06:18 - and drink and i'm definitely there
06:20 - um you know i've read blogs and
06:23 - we've kind of beg stole and borrowed um
06:26 - lots of kind of resources and things
06:27 - from people as well and really just kind
06:29 - of giving ourselves a basic
06:30 - understanding of of what we need to do
06:33 - and also trying to understand where our
06:34 - risk points were for the business
06:37 - um
06:38 - this maybe comes back to not stolen but
06:40 - kind of we acquired adida gdpr policy
06:43 - pack and that was actually really
06:44 - helpful i mean it was
06:46 - it's pretty pretty thick but actually it
06:48 - helps us understand
06:51 - kind of a benchmark of where we where we
06:53 - needed to get to
06:54 - with all our data so for example it had
06:56 - a secure coding policy it had a patch
06:59 - management policy it had an encryption
07:01 - policy password policy day retention
07:03 - asset management all sorts of things
07:05 - which gave us a basic understanding of
07:07 - how we should deal or deal with some of
07:09 - these things and what the standards were
07:11 - that we needed to work towards so that
07:13 - meant we could do a gap analysis and go
07:15 - right we're kind of here you know and we
07:17 - need to be here what's all the stuff
07:19 - that we need to do and then we kind of
07:20 - work with the business to kind of
07:22 - prioritize what was important or most
07:24 - important
07:26 - so we then decided we need to find where
07:29 - all that data is we knew we had this
07:30 - customer data candidate data cv phone
07:32 - numbers
07:34 - um but i guess with like any small
07:35 - company that's kind of maturing there
07:38 - were you know things in spreadsheets
07:40 - there were things on people's machines
07:42 - there was various um
07:45 - kind of servers
07:47 - our live service test servers staging
07:49 - local machines with copies of databases
07:51 - on potentially
07:53 - um
07:54 - we had cdn s3 storage we had our backups
07:58 - we had printouts maybe lying about the
08:00 - office
08:01 - um i'm making it sound really bad
08:03 - it sounds like data everywhere but these
08:06 - are the things that we had to start
08:07 - looking just to make sure
08:09 - where is the data and then how can we
08:10 - make it more secure as well
08:12 - um also logging and analytics was one as
08:15 - well just to look to make sure that we
08:17 - weren't um holding any data there too
08:21 - okay so we found we kind of mapped out
08:23 - all the data and for us because we're a
08:25 - small company actually a lot of a lot of
08:28 - those kind of places were locations
08:30 - especially from a technical perspective
08:32 - with from third party suppliers so
08:35 - um you know our car hosting our email
08:38 - service um even our devops kind of
08:40 - operations as third party so we um
08:43 - engaged with them to help understand if
08:45 - they were moving to compliance and what
08:46 - they were doing and actually that was
08:48 - fantastic to help us learnt as well
08:50 - learn as well i was like oh what are you
08:51 - doing oh we know maybe we should do that
08:53 - as well
08:54 - so that's really helped
08:58 - then once we'd found it um
09:00 - we really kind of tried to understand
09:02 - did we really need it was it important
09:04 - is it just because you know we haven't
09:05 - had a
09:06 - showed up retention policy that we've
09:08 - got quite a lot of customer data
09:11 - um so we actually deleted a lot of data
09:13 - that we didn't need um or we anonymised
09:17 - what we what we did need to keep um so
09:20 - that was quite that was almost an
09:22 - opportunity as well because i think from
09:24 - a technical perspective that's made it a
09:26 - lot easier to manage costs less than
09:28 - storage and a lot of other things as
09:29 - well
09:31 - okay
09:34 - so then we looked at the data that we
09:36 - had left and we're like who's got access
09:38 - to it
09:39 - um
09:40 - so this back to kind of passwords was
09:42 - called um you know we invite kind of
09:44 - password uh password policies or
09:47 - stronger password policies again being a
09:49 - small company there'd been this kind of
09:51 - oh you know i'll just borrow that
09:53 - password you know a shared password that
09:55 - was written down printed on the wall
09:57 - although that might be a safer place to
09:59 - keep it remember what we're saying here
10:02 - simple things like making sure that
10:04 - people lock in their screen
10:06 - creating a bit of a starter and lever
10:07 - process
10:08 - even though there's only you know there
10:10 - was only kind of nine people when we
10:12 - started
10:13 - the amount of access that could have
10:14 - been given on an ad hoc basis and then
10:16 - someone would leave and it would be like
10:18 - a few weeks later they've you know they
10:19 - potentially still got a password to a
10:21 - live production system it's like ah you
10:22 - know we need to get process in place to
10:24 - make sure
10:25 - and that we don't do that
10:27 - again
10:30 - so that was access to the data
10:32 - and then anything that's left any of the
10:34 - data that's left looking at making sure
10:36 - that we're securing it as much as
10:37 - possible
10:38 - so that's kind of the point we're at at
10:39 - the minute is looking at improving the
10:41 - encryption of our application data
10:44 - but also you know making sure that disk
10:46 - encryption's on on the laptops for for
10:48 - users if they've got anything downloaded
10:51 - um
10:52 - yep
10:54 - um
10:56 - and generally kind of continuing to
10:59 - create processes
11:01 - um
11:03 - and assurances as we kind of grow the
11:04 - code base as well
11:06 - so looking at um
11:09 - we've got it sorry you know
11:11 - ongoing vulnerability scanning regular
11:13 - pen tests
11:15 - um using for example breakman in the
11:17 - release pipeline to make sure that we're
11:19 - continually just checkpointing where we
11:21 - are
11:22 - trying to document a little bit more so
11:24 - that when people are coming in to kind
11:25 - of understanding how things are working
11:27 - what we're using
11:28 - and looking at implementing kind of
11:30 - privacy by design which is something
11:32 - that gdpr talks about which is really
11:34 - where with any kind of new development
11:36 - you're doing kind of really thinking
11:37 - about that data do you need it where are
11:39 - you going to store it who's going to
11:40 - access it
11:42 - so that you can continually make sure
11:44 - that you kind of keep this up
11:48 - so what's next um
11:51 - so really i think
11:52 - we're going to try and work on how do we
11:54 - automate a lot of this stuff as we move
11:56 - forwards
11:57 - i think because we're a small company a
11:58 - lot of it is around kind of process you
12:00 - know it's kind of process driven we
12:02 - can't afford a kind of all singing or
12:03 - dancing gdepr
12:05 - one kind of push solution and a lot of
12:08 - it is kind of workarounds and best
12:09 - endeavors to make sure that we can
12:11 - follow the processes so hopefully as we
12:13 - move forward we'll be able to automate a
12:15 - lot of that for the business and help
12:16 - them
12:18 - um but just generally um
12:20 - it's never it's never going to be done
12:22 - it's kind of it's not a you get to the i
12:24 - think it's the 25th of may where it
12:26 - officially comes in which is why your
12:28 - emails will be hammered i think even
12:30 - more so for the next week apologies if
12:32 - you get one from us
12:33 - um
12:34 - but it's just it's kind of one of those
12:36 - it's those ongoing processes it's really
12:37 - important to kind of bed in and educate
12:40 - people within your teams to make sure
12:41 - they understand what they need to do
12:43 - so thank you you're all still awake so
12:45 - let's start
12:47 - [Applause]
