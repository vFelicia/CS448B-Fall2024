06:25 - Welcome to a new day! It’s Thursday.
06:28 - We are in Málaga.
06:30 - Today we’re going to talk in Spanish because
06:32 - today I start my new Spanish course.
06:36 - To understand all the people who live here you need to speak Spanish.
06:39 - If you don’t do it, it isn’t easy to live here.
06:43 - When I’m talking with people from Madrid
06:46 - I understand majority from what they are saying.
06:49 - They finish all the words and it’s easier.
