00:08 - everyone welcome to live coding with
00:10 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're gonna
00:13 - make a landing page with react so we'll
00:17 - be using material UI to help us out with
00:19 - that if you don't know that much about
00:23 - react don't worry feel free to ask as
00:25 - many questions as you want and I'll do
00:28 - my best to explain things and answer
00:31 - your questions if you're new to the show
00:34 - this is how it works I set a timer for
00:37 - 25 minutes and we do mostly code for 25
00:40 - minutes and then we take a five-minute
00:42 - break and I check the live chat and I'll
00:47 - answer questions as many as I can in
00:49 - five minutes then we'll do another 25
00:51 - minute code session and then after that
00:53 - I'll spend the rest of the stream
00:55 - answering your questions so if you can
01:00 - put a question in the chat and I'll
01:03 - definitely see that if you can't for
01:05 - whatever reason put a question in the
01:07 - chat right now you could always add it
01:08 - as a comment to this video or you could
01:11 - ask me a question on any social media my
01:15 - DMS are open and I do my best to get
01:18 - back to you as soon as I can all right
01:22 - let's get started I will show you my
01:27 - screen let's get this code a little bit
01:30 - bigger okay that might be an all right
01:35 - size let me know if it's not and let me
01:41 - show you here we go let's start out like
01:43 - this you all will get to see my
01:47 - excellent drawing skills okay here's the
01:51 - basic outline for the page that we're
01:54 - gonna build so we're gonna have a hero
01:57 - section at the top above that will be
01:59 - our hour at bar you know our top
02:03 - navigation menu that we already have
02:06 - we're going to do a hero section that's
02:08 - going to be very similar to the one that
02:09 - we did on the home page and
02:12 - then I'd like to have a section with a
02:17 - little bit of text maybe icons if we
02:21 - have some icons that's gonna highlight
02:22 - some of the programs on campus we're
02:26 - gonna have whoa we're gonna have another
02:30 - section that would highlight different
02:35 - types of programs so these will be on
02:37 - campus
02:38 - online and then steps for how to apply
02:43 - and these will be you know very brief
02:46 - with links to the ways to apply and then
02:50 - we're gonna have another section that
02:53 - potentially could include things about
02:56 - costs or we can include some of the main
03:00 - selling points that seem to be seem to
03:04 - resonate with our potential students so
03:08 - this I worked for University in this
03:10 - page is going to be the admissions
03:12 - landing page so I actually did this
03:14 - sketch after sitting down with the
03:16 - graduate admissions people and seeing
03:20 - what what they thought would work but
03:22 - we're gonna do one for the undergraduate
03:24 - admissions today but we're going to use
03:26 - the same layout so we're gonna use a lot
03:28 - of just sample data and then let the
03:32 - people from admissions you'll give us
03:34 - the content that we need to fill it out
03:36 - later
03:37 - some other things that we may want to
03:39 - include are testimonials and other sales
03:42 - points right so those could potentially
03:44 - go here and might be like a quote from a
03:48 - former student and a picture if we have
03:53 - a picture of them so today we'll
03:55 - probably just use you know whatever
03:58 - whatever images we can find and whatever
04:01 - quotes we can pull the most important
04:04 - thing is getting something on the page
04:06 - the layout something to look at because
04:09 - I have a meeting with the people from
04:11 - admissions coming up I think next week
04:14 - and I need to show them something
04:17 - because they're gonna be the ones that
04:20 - are gonna approve whether or not this
04:23 - site is ready to go live
04:25 - because this is primarily a tool for
04:27 - marketing to prospective students okay I
04:32 - won't make you look at my sketch anymore
04:38 - okay so for those of you who haven't
04:41 - been following the stream this is kind
04:43 - of a view of the homepage so this is
04:46 - going to stay this top navigation our
04:48 - hero section is going to look somewhat
04:50 - similar to this we may end up going with
04:53 - maybe like a smaller version of this the
04:57 - this kind of thing I think is okay for a
04:58 - homepage but for me personally it gets a
05:01 - little annoying if I start seeing this
05:03 - on a lot of interior pages
05:04 - I'd rather get to the content so we may
05:07 - cut down on the height and then we're
05:10 - gonna have some similarities in the
05:13 - sections and we may reuse some of these
05:15 - elements that we've already made and
05:18 - that'll save us some code but we'll
05:21 - probably have to code some some new
05:23 - stuff as well okay all right let me say
05:30 - I got a lot of action in the chat oh
05:32 - yeah a lot of people in here so I
05:34 - imagine there are some new people
05:35 - welcome so hey everyone just I'm not
05:40 - gonna say hi to everybody individually
05:41 - because there's a lot of people in here
05:43 - right now but I just want to say hi and
05:44 - I'll read through your comments in more
05:47 - detail at the end of the stream okay
05:50 - let's get the Palmer two hour timer
05:52 - started and let me start up this end
05:54 - Rock server so that you all can view
05:58 - what I'm working on as I'm working on it
06:02 - and you can inspect it in your browser
06:04 - open up dev tools mess around with it
06:06 - whatever you want
06:08 - so go and click on that link if clicking
06:10 - on the link doesn't work you may want to
06:11 - try copy and pasting it sometimes the
06:13 - live chat links don't work right if you
06:16 - click alright it looks like it's working
06:20 - for these some of you
06:27 - so first things first we need to
06:29 - actually create the page the component
06:31 - page and we need to make a route to it
06:33 - in our server das file and that's pretty
06:36 - much gonna be the only back-end ish type
06:39 - of stuff that we do really minimal all
06:41 - its going to be all front-end stuff
06:42 - today okay so whenever I create a new
06:47 - component I always try to recycle code
06:50 - from a previous component to cut down on
06:52 - the amount of typing that needs to be
06:54 - done so let's take a current page that
06:59 - we're already using and we may as well
07:02 - use the home page because we're gonna
07:05 - use so much of what's already on the
07:08 - home page so our home page should be
07:11 - index yep index so I'm just going to
07:14 - copy and paste everything from index j/s
07:18 - and let's make a new file and we're
07:23 - gonna call this admissions ojs and i
07:31 - paste everything in there and we need to
07:33 - change the name
07:41 - to admissions okay other than that
07:49 - everything should work and now we need
07:51 - to point that that URL path for
07:54 - admissions to the right place so let's
07:57 - go to our server Jas file which I
08:00 - usually have open there it is
08:01 - and let's look up admissions admission
08:09 - [Music]
08:11 - there we go
08:12 - here's admissions and we want to say our
08:21 - default is gonna go to our defaults Nate
08:32 - and now go to slash admissions so if
08:36 - you're not sure what's going on here
08:37 - don't worry about it where this is all
08:40 - we're gonna do right now I guess the
08:43 - only that's important to know is that
08:44 - this just controls what components going
08:47 - to render whenever we go to a certain
08:49 - URL is so what did I do wrong
08:53 - [Music]
08:55 - what's it's elevating
09:01 - that should be fine right
09:07 - oops
09:09 - default is admissions and then what's
09:14 - the next thing this needs to be
09:16 - secondary
09:25 - right
09:32 - okay remember the key words I use let me
09:34 - double-check was standard
09:39 - yeah sorry standard not sure what I was
09:43 - thinking when I named it standard all
09:55 - right there we are so I had to put that
09:57 - in as well so that all the rest of the
10:00 - pages we want to go to the page
10:01 - component to be rendered for now this
10:04 - one is just going to go through the
10:05 - admissions page components and yeah and
10:12 - this should work cool all right so let's
10:18 - let's really test now and see if it does
10:20 - work so we're gonna go to slash
10:22 - admissions oh quick update for those of
10:30 - you that have actually loaded this hey
10:31 - it works awesome
10:32 - it'd have actually loaded this project
10:34 - onto your machine from github and links
10:38 - in the description if you want to check
10:39 - out the code on github it's all over the
10:41 - source do what you want with it but if
10:43 - you have downloaded it please pull in
10:46 - the latest changes I did a lot of work
10:48 - on Friday and like into Friday night and
10:51 - I made some updates for the packages and
10:54 - I had to update the version of node that
10:56 - I was using so you may have depending on
10:59 - what version of node you were currently
11:01 - running it may not work anymore unless
11:04 - you update so just a heads up on that
11:09 - okay so we have our route to the
11:12 - admissions face working which is great
11:16 - last week
11:17 - nothing works simple things broke and it
11:21 - was a mess we're already at doing better
11:23 - this week alright so now let's go into
11:26 - the code and rip out the stuff that we
11:29 - don't need and replace it with with some
11:31 - other things so a lot of connections
11:36 - open on end rock that's awesome shoutout
11:39 - to inconceivable for giving us a free
11:42 - unlimited
11:43 - and for these rico camp live streams
11:45 - with the end rock service okay so we're
11:53 - done with that server ojs file and we're
11:57 - just going to focus now on our
11:59 - admissions file and let's give us give
12:02 - ourselves a ton of space to work with
12:05 - and let me double check I don't know if
12:10 - anybody said anything about the font
12:12 - size so let me know now if the font size
12:16 - is too small increase it I'll try to
12:18 - remember in about a minute to look back
12:20 - at the chat okay so for now so if you're
12:26 - not familiar with react let me just give
12:27 - you a quick intro so a react component
12:29 - is just like a chunk of code and it can
12:35 - include your markup right like your HTML
12:38 - Javascript and CSS all in one but the
12:43 - HTML doesn't it looks kind of like HTML
12:47 - but it has JavaScript blended in we call
12:49 - that JSX
12:50 - and your CSS may not look exactly like
12:55 - normal CSS okay so in this case our CSS
12:58 - is actually a JavaScript object what it
13:01 - should look a bit familiar to you
13:04 - there's just some difference like we
13:06 - have some camel casing going on here and
13:08 - we don't have semicolons at the end of
13:10 - the line all right but other than that
13:13 - these do exactly what you they would
13:16 - normally do in CSS and we also are
13:19 - pulling in code from a lot of other
13:20 - places so all these imports at the top
13:22 - we're pulling in other components and
13:24 - other pieces of code to help us alright
13:28 - so all we're doing is saying we want to
13:30 - import this thing and we're going to
13:31 - call it typography in this case and
13:34 - we're going to get it from here and here
13:36 - is where we put in the path and the
13:37 - filename all right so these are all the
13:41 - styles we're going to keep those as is
13:43 - for now and we'll edit those later on
13:45 - when we need to all right here's how
13:49 - we're going to start out with so we have
13:50 - this hero component and that's for our
13:52 - hero section that we see here
13:55 - so a long time ago we months ago we
14:01 - abstracted out that hero component in
14:05 - into its own little component because we
14:07 - assumed like we're probably going to
14:08 - need to use this again for another page
14:10 - well we finally have to use it again for
14:12 - another page so good thing we did that
14:14 - for now I'm going to keep this image
14:17 - because I don't have another image in
14:19 - mind just want to keep it like this but
14:21 - eventually we'll change it out and we're
14:24 - just going to change out a little bit of
14:26 - the text and we're gonna see about
14:29 - setting the height I don't know if I
14:32 - built that in yet or not so we'll check
14:35 - that component out see if it's built in
14:36 - if not we'll build something into the
14:38 - component to allow us to really easily
14:39 - change the height if you joined a little
14:45 - bit late I'm not ignoring your questions
14:48 - for for good we're gonna reset a timer
14:52 - and so in about 15 minutes I'm gonna get
14:55 - to all the questions so if you can stick
14:58 - around for a bit I will answer it this
15:00 - stream will also be recording recorded
15:03 - and it will be available to watch the
15:04 - replay on this channel with free code
15:07 - camp channel so if you miss something
15:10 - don't worry you can always watch it
15:11 - again so let's change this to
15:20 - we're gonna change it to undergraduate
15:21 - admissions and then below this I'm just
15:28 - gonna leave the the tagline for the
15:31 - University which is academically
15:33 - excellent passionately Catholic so it's
15:35 - a Catholic school run by Franciscans and
15:39 - you know what I want to keep these
15:41 - buttons because these are the main
15:43 - things that admissions would want you to
15:46 - do apply enquire a visit so we can keep
15:48 - those buttons so a lot of that it's nice
15:50 - it can stay the same so we'll save that
15:53 - and then let's go to that hero component
15:58 - so let me close up some of these folders
16:01 - so it's not so cluttered okay so here's
16:08 - our components and where's our hero
16:14 - there we are
16:15 - I mean it's an alphabetical order
16:17 - shouldn't be that hard right all right
16:20 - so here's our hero component and here's
16:22 - where we get our height from this this
16:25 - min height of 80 VH so the VHS viewport
16:30 - height so if you see a t think 80% of
16:33 - the screen height so I do want to drop
16:37 - that down but right now we don't really
16:40 - have a way to drop that down through our
16:44 - props right so these are the things that
16:46 - we pass in so if you see here we passed
16:49 - in all this data into the component
16:51 - these are called props so we want to
16:54 - make a prop that could give us the
16:56 - height so let's see
17:06 - let's just call it min min height so
17:15 - it'll be really clear what it is
17:17 - we'll say min height and for this one I
17:19 - want to pass in let's go 66 tbh we'll
17:31 - see how that looks all right so we're
17:34 - passing it in now but we're not doing
17:36 - anything with it over here so over here
17:39 - I'm gonna say men whoops
17:44 - men Heights okay so we're using object
17:51 - destructuring here so that we don't have
17:53 - to keep typing in and this props over
17:56 - and over again so all of our props are
18:00 - here
18:02 - just nice to have a list of all the
18:04 - props anyway and then down here we're
18:08 - gonna find the spot where we've we're
18:11 - putting this these styles so parallax is
18:16 - the class that we've given it so let's
18:18 - see where we have parallax these are all
18:22 - our buttons here we go parallax so what
18:26 - we'll do we already are overriding a
18:29 - style here for the background image so
18:31 - we're just going to do it again and
18:33 - we're gonna add a style so this is
18:36 - similar to the normal style attribute
18:40 - that you can give an element in HTML
18:41 - right but instead we have these brackets
18:44 - the first set of brackets says hey we're
18:46 - gonna write some JavaScript the second
18:48 - set of brackets since we're in
18:50 - JavaScript now indicates a JavaScript
18:52 - object so again like it was above we
18:56 - have our CSS in the form of a JavaScript
19:00 - object okay and we're gonna do just like
19:04 - we did here we're gonna make use of
19:05 - template literals which is an es6 es2015
19:09 - thing that allow us to mix strings with
19:14 - javascript without having to concatenate
19:17 - a bunch of plus signs so this will do so
19:20 - let's put in min heights and then we'll
19:26 - use actually what we need to know we
19:30 - won't because we we've put it all
19:31 - together so we should be able to just
19:35 - add in let's see if that works
19:44 - I'm a little bit minutes not too fine
19:49 - hmm it's not gonna like me saying me all
19:54 - right so let's see let's say minimum
19:59 - Heights about that in that'll avoid
20:06 - confusion and minimum Heights
20:16 - minimum Heights and then we'll go back
20:19 - here and add in minimum right so now
20:25 - there will be no confusion between the
20:28 - the CSS that says men height and our
20:31 - variable that we passed in as a prop
20:34 - that's it's men minimum height okay
20:37 - let's check it out now hey it worked
20:40 - right so you could see it used to be
20:43 - down here now it's much smaller so I
20:48 - like that for now
20:49 - maybe I'll go a little bit smaller we'll
20:52 - see it definitely depends on the image
20:54 - that we end up using as whether or not
20:57 - that image will even work with these
20:59 - kind of dimensions yeah but you can see
21:02 - when we do that it's definitely a
21:06 - percentage of the of the screen so it
21:12 - changes as we move things around just
21:17 - about ten more minutes and then I'll get
21:18 - to the questions all right awesome
21:24 - so that part of this is for now done
21:28 - right but we need we definitely need to
21:30 - get some input on the image and the text
21:33 - to put here but I believe the buttons
21:36 - and undergraduate admissions will be
21:39 - fine all right so for this next part
21:42 - let's let's go ahead and set it up for
21:46 - testimonials I think testimonials are
21:49 - good let me think about it when you go
21:52 - to Amazon and you look at a product you
21:56 - usually scroll down and see what people
21:58 - say about it at least I know I do right
22:00 - I want to make sure
22:01 - okay this product looks cool I checked
22:03 - the price first and I check to see if
22:06 - it's prime so I get that free shipping
22:07 - right and then the very next thing I
22:09 - check is I scroll down and see you know
22:12 - what did what did people say so I think
22:16 - that would also be useful if a student
22:19 - is potential student is looking at
22:22 - Franciscan University and they say all
22:24 - right well I know all the marketing
22:26 - stuff they're putting out there but what
22:27 - other people say all right
22:29 - of course we're only going to put the
22:31 - good stuff on our website for reviews
22:33 - but you know that's how it goes so let's
22:40 - take let's take these this style of of
22:47 - card and let's reuse this style for our
22:54 - testimony our testimonials so we'll do
22:59 - an image and then quote and we're
23:05 - probably we're not gonna have a link
23:07 - right so depending on the content we get
23:12 - maybe this could end up being an entire
23:14 - page but for now I'm just gonna assume
23:16 - we just have a really small quote and a
23:19 - small image and that's it and we'll try
23:21 - to go three across on a large screen of
23:26 - course they'll stack on mobile also as
23:31 - I'm going through if if any of you have
23:33 - suggestions for for what I'm doing or if
23:37 - you see me doing something wrong let me
23:39 - know alright so let's figure out what
23:44 - this what component this is it looks
23:48 - like
23:53 - profile card great so this is profile
23:58 - card and let's grab let's grab this
24:05 - whole thing because these are there's
24:09 - two profile cards in here already
24:14 - I'm just going to take this out to
24:17 - profile cards in there already and so
24:19 - that'll be good that's what we want and
24:26 - let's make a container so we're going to
24:31 - put it in right here
24:38 - so for our container we're just going to
24:40 - make a div and we're gonna give it a I'm
24:44 - sorry we're gonna do a grid this is
24:47 - something that comes with material UI if
24:49 - you're not familiar with react think of
24:52 - material UI is like like bootstrap is
24:54 - right or materialized CSS is for you
24:59 - know like a normal website look at
25:01 - JavaScript just vanilla JavaScript site
25:04 - so what material UI does is it gives us
25:07 - a set of styles and components that we
25:09 - can use and it keeps the consistent
25:11 - material design feel to the site so
25:15 - we're going to use this grid and we're
25:16 - going to call it we're going to give it
25:18 - the attribute or prop up container
25:23 - alright so we want to container grid
25:26 - wood and close that out as well oops
25:37 - okay let me double check and make sure
25:39 - it's supposed to be container I think it
25:46 - is I don't know why I didn't have a
25:49 - container earlier okay so we made a
25:54 - great container and now we have these
25:56 - grid items inside of here and I want to
25:59 - try to do three items so let's add a
26:02 - third one and notice when we have this
26:05 - grid that I may end up taking this class
26:09 - off we'll have to see what's in there
26:10 - but for our other props we're saying we
26:14 - have extra small small medium and large
26:16 - these are screen sizes so we're telling
26:18 - it how many columns out of twelve to
26:21 - take up on a particular screen size so
26:24 - right now we're taking up the full width
26:28 - twelve columns on an extra small screen
26:31 - and on all other screen sizes we're
26:33 - taking up half the width well that
26:35 - worked when we only had two but now we
26:37 - have three so that's definitely not
26:38 - going to work so let's change this up
26:43 - and let's try four right so four columns
26:52 - will allow us to have three items right
26:56 - side by side so let's see how that looks
27:04 - all right there we go so there's our
27:06 - three cards side by side okay
27:11 - so a few things to note I think we can
27:14 - go a bit smaller with these with these
27:16 - cars and I don't know that I like them
27:19 - being so wide across
27:21 - I would prefer maybe a bit more margin
27:23 - on the sides and I don't like that
27:27 - they're not the same heights so other
27:33 - than that they're showing up properly
27:36 - let's shrink this down all right you see
27:38 - and they didn't stack up when we shrink
27:41 - them down okay so they basically behave
27:47 - the way that they're supposed to okay I
27:53 - do want to check out what kind of CSS
27:56 - we're adding here so let's let's find
27:59 - our class called grid item fix there we
28:05 - are servicing with 100% Patti okay
28:14 - there's nothing there that would really
28:16 - mess up anything that we're doing so I'm
28:21 - gonna leave it like that what I think we
28:24 - we ought to do though is add this
28:27 - content container in all right this will
28:30 - give us that padding on the sides that
28:32 - we want and you see depending on the
28:35 - screen size we'll have like more or less
28:37 - padding so we're not actually adding
28:39 - like padding right like we would do a
28:41 - CSS padding we're just setting the
28:44 - maximum width to a percentage so it it
28:47 - seems like padding right and on a
28:50 - smaller screen we have less on the sides
28:52 - which makes sense because we want to be
28:56 - able to display more content on a small
28:57 - screen but on a large screen you know
29:00 - the content would be huge the images
29:01 - would be way too big which is exactly
29:03 - what we have going on here so let's grab
29:05 - this content container I'm just gonna
29:09 - copy that and then I'm going to come
29:11 - down here to our grid container and
29:13 - we're giving it a give it a class name
29:15 - of we're gonna say classes and I'll
29:24 - paste that in there we are
29:27 - so the styles should all be applied now
29:33 - all right awesome so now you see we have
29:38 - much smaller images yet this works I
29:49 - definitely want to try to find images of
29:52 - students where so like this type of
29:54 - image will work where it's primarily the
29:56 - the student you see the student when we
29:58 - have this one where you know the image
30:01 - is primarily the background right this
30:03 - this hallway it doesn't work quite as
30:06 - much because the images are now a bit
30:08 - smaller so probably want to switch out
30:11 - these images of course we're gonna have
30:12 - different students but for now this will
30:18 - work let's just remove these links
30:20 - though I don't want the links right now
30:24 - and we built these components so that I
30:26 - believe we should be able to remove this
30:28 - prop for link and and once we remove the
30:39 - prop it just won't display that link
30:41 - anymore
30:42 - okay so otherwise if you try to do that
30:45 - you haven't built that in wood you may
30:48 - end up with is an error because it'll be
30:52 - looking for data that's not there and I
30:53 - might throw an error so let's say that
30:57 - and this would be the last thing we
30:58 - check before you are the questions yep
30:59 - there we go no errors alright so got the
31:04 - hero section and that first section
31:07 - pretty much laid out notice I'm not
31:10 - doing any really detailed stuff that'll
31:12 - come on the second pass when we really
31:14 - get into things also before I have final
31:17 - approval it's almost a waste of time to
31:20 - go into the details and try to fix
31:21 - everything you know we could spend hours
31:26 - you know just on this
31:28 - action getting everything perfect and
31:29 - then I'll go into a meeting and find out
31:31 - they don't want that section at all when
31:33 - we throw it out right okay let me do a
31:39 - break I'm gonna scroll all the way up to
31:41 - the top of the chat and just go down so
31:43 - if you ask your question recently I may
31:45 - not get to it this time but I'll get to
31:47 - it at the end of the stream Sherman said
31:53 - before the stream even started is it a
31:55 - static website Vennela react you're
31:56 - gonna use things like Gatsby hopefully
31:58 - vanilla we're using next Jas so it's not
32:01 - exactly vanilla react but next doesn't
32:04 - add in a whole lot of extra stuff so in
32:07 - terms of how we design the components
32:09 - themselves it's it's pretty much vanilla
32:12 - react unless you know if you want to
32:13 - count the tour UI obviously that's not
32:16 - vanilla everyone so what are you saying
32:20 - hi more assess what live stream software
32:23 - I'm using OBS so OBS is free and I
32:28 - believe it's available for Windows Mac
32:31 - and Linux so check it out if anybody has
32:35 - questions about how I do my settings for
32:37 - OBS let me know I can screenshot my
32:39 - settings okay one us when I'm building
32:46 - and I think I kind of covered that so
32:49 - hopefully answer your question one if
32:51 - you still have questions about what I'm
32:52 - building let me know
33:02 - miss Sara says you use Gatsby for
33:06 - project five-day - did you use further
33:08 - Gatsby for project five or use Gatsby
33:11 - just for projects holiday - we ended up
33:13 - not using Gatsby and we went with next
33:16 - Jas it fit the requirements of a project
33:18 - better and I was more familiar with it
33:20 - so we ended up one with next so we
33:22 - didn't use Gatsby for that project but
33:27 - we still have the Gatsby branch
33:29 - available so if you wanted to go back
33:32 - and you use that as a basis for a
33:35 - project feel free it may be a bit
33:37 - outdated now since that was six months
33:40 - ago
33:42 - all right Michael creo says don't put
33:44 - cost on the front page maybe don't but
33:52 - don't put it on the page that can be
33:53 - added with SEO maybe add a link to it
33:57 - yeah you know what one thing is for our
33:59 - graduate program the price is is a
34:02 - really good price so we want to put the
34:05 - cost for that because it's a big selling
34:07 - point our undergrad program is
34:09 - definitely a good price for a private
34:12 - education but it's it's not something
34:16 - that people say wow this is really cheap
34:18 - school so we don't really want to add
34:20 - that as you know advertise that college
34:25 - cost so much money that even if it's a
34:28 - good price it still seems like a lot so
34:30 - we don't really want to put that on
34:31 - there and you're definitely right
34:33 - Michael I'm not trying to hide it from
34:36 - anybody but you don't just want that to
34:38 - stand out on the very first page Steven
34:47 - says amazing art totally makes sense
34:49 - worst handwriting ever yeah for sure I
34:51 - type I type I don't need to write on
34:55 - paper right one says give me the link to
35:01 - get your source code it's in the
35:03 - description so just kind of scroll down
35:06 - and check check the link in the
35:09 - description
35:16 - crystal says what language you coding
35:18 - this with this is JavaScript in
35:20 - particular it's react which is a library
35:24 - that helps us build progressive web apps
35:28 - in JavaScript and you can build other
35:30 - things with it as well
35:39 - see
35:42 - one says cool I'm gonna clone your web
35:44 - with the source code awesome
35:53 - see crystal says what's the name of your
35:57 - editor it is Visual Studio code so I see
36:00 - joby thanks for answering that in the
36:02 - chat what type of font are you using for
36:08 - the website itself we're using Roboto
36:11 - and then for my editor its feet fyra
36:14 - font or fear of font I'm not sure how to
36:16 - pronounce that
36:17 - Fira and that is Michael Michael added
36:22 - in the chat it's Visual Studio code with
36:24 - the seti theme so seti is the theme that
36:28 - I'm using Christopher says good font
36:38 - size alright awesome I'm glad that I'm
36:40 - glad you all can see that oh well
36:46 - Michael so you might want to add that
36:47 - and rock shout out to your YouTube
36:49 - description for the stream that's X
36:50 - that's a really great idea
36:52 - maybe I'll write up something about that
36:55 - okay
36:56 - I'm gonna mark down where I'm leaving
37:00 - off at in the chat cuz my timer just
37:02 - went up and that way I can come right
37:04 - back to it after we do another 25
37:07 - minutes of code okay so if I didn't get
37:11 - to your question now apologies but I
37:13 - definitely will get to it after the next
37:15 - 25-minute coding session let's start
37:19 - this up okay and let me put the link
37:22 - into this Pomodoro clock this was built
37:24 - by Harshit who frequently watches the
37:28 - stream not here today though but it's a
37:31 - nice Pomodoro clock so go ahead and a
37:34 - few a few others of you that watch the
37:36 - stream also it made really awesome
37:38 - Pomodoro clocks so I'll shout out your
37:43 - clocks if you want me to just let me
37:44 - know okay over yet
37:50 - wait a second what's your seven
37:54 - there we are
38:02 - all right let's let's go into the next
38:04 - section then like I said I don't want to
38:06 - be too detailed about this so let's see
38:13 - so we said that our next section was
38:16 - going to be our programs now this would
38:19 - work for our graduate programs because
38:22 - we don't have so much so many programs
38:26 - but for our undergrad programs I don't
38:29 - think that layout would work so let's
38:33 - think of another way we could do this
38:36 - I'm thinking we need to break this out
38:39 - into categories so let's see if we can
38:44 - keep
38:51 - I definitely want to break it out into
38:54 - we can do three categories that would
38:56 - work we can do five categories we can do
38:59 - six categories I think any of those
39:04 - combinations would work just in terms of
39:07 - laying things out on a screen so it
39:08 - would look
39:09 - it would look okay so you know what
39:13 - let's take a look let's take a look at
39:16 - our page that lists all of our our
39:19 - undergraduate programs so it should be
39:28 - ug majors alright so this is just the
39:35 - list that's come maybe that's not it
39:41 - maybe it's oh no it's automatically
39:49 - sending us here now all right I'm not
39:54 - gonna worry about that now because I
39:56 - don't want to get into the the server
39:58 - stuff more but off to fix that after so
40:01 - let's go here
40:08 - academics ug majors alright that'll
40:11 - actually work academics that makes sense
40:17 - okay
40:19 - there we are okay so here's all the
40:24 - majors that we currently have so I'm
40:31 - wondering I don't know how many that is
40:35 - but we definitely could split things up
40:38 - although we could go through like
40:41 - humanities or Sciences I mean that's
40:45 - definitely a a.split we can do social
40:51 - sciences as a as a split all right let's
40:57 - try this split let's try humanities
41:00 - science and social science and then I'll
41:06 - we'll all let admissions figure out what
41:09 - categories to put what in oh Michael
41:13 - Chris at 53 Oh
41:14 - 53 majors okay that's gonna be a lot
41:21 - let's see how it looks
41:30 - I mean you have business business
41:32 - business business
41:47 - yeah I'm gonna I'm just gonna put these
41:51 - categories down as an example of what
41:53 - could be so that we can show it at the
41:55 - meeting all right so let me let's go
42:05 - back to this page we can visualize this
42:07 - so I'm envisioning like let's say five
42:12 - categories so we would have like one two
42:14 - three and then four or five would be in
42:17 - between in these spaces so we'll have
42:20 - bigger gaps here but they'll kind of
42:22 - split the difference and what we'll have
42:24 - is essentially lists
42:32 - I'm not hundred percent sure that this
42:34 - is is gonna work is it that in terms of
42:39 - is it it's gonna look good but I think
42:43 - it's worth a shot I think it'll give the
42:45 - students very quick access to more
42:47 - information about what they want to do
42:49 - and it'll let them know right off the
42:51 - bat you know here's what the majors we
42:54 - have here's what we offer right our
42:56 - products is based off of majors so I
43:00 - think that's a great thing to put out
43:02 - there right away here's what we offer
43:04 - here's all the flavors of college that
43:06 - we offer here right
43:16 - okay so let's just grab this grid that
43:18 - we just made and let's add this in here
43:25 - could we do yeah let's at it here we may
43:36 - we may not well this will work for now I
43:41 - may want to change this up a bit later
43:47 - on but no sense in trying to refactor
43:50 - anything right now
43:50 - did I get everything there we are
43:55 - okay so instead of profile cards let's
44:00 - get rid of these profile cards for now
44:06 - we're gonna create essentially our our
44:10 - own thing and if we really like it we
44:11 - want it to work we'll make it our
44:12 - component but for right now I don't have
44:15 - a component that does what I want it to
44:17 - do already so let's just go with this
44:19 - let's do a actually we just did this
44:23 - somewhere we might be able to copy and
44:25 - paste what page did we just do this on
44:31 - okay y'all that I some of you were there
44:34 - for that stream I know I was asking
44:37 - about how to correctly put a heading on
44:41 - a list in a way that screen readers
44:44 - would understand what page was that what
44:51 - were you working on I can't remember if
44:54 - anybody remembers let me know in the
44:55 - chat and we can copy that for now I'll
44:57 - just make this list cuz I know we need
45:00 - the list you well let's do a few L eyes
45:12 - and I wish I had a mitt in here I'm not
45:15 - sure if I have M it in here hold on
45:17 - aside I forget how to do it anyway
45:35 - the education page is that it the one
45:44 - with the courses yep that's it that is
45:47 - it where is it a sample schedule yes
45:50 - awesome section that's how we did it we
45:54 - did section that's what we want
46:06 - okay so it's good to always have
46:08 - accessibility in mind and by that I mean
46:11 - like mainly screen readers so they'll be
46:14 - able to see it but not just screen
46:16 - readers also like the correct contrast
46:18 - between your fonts and your backgrounds
46:21 - good font sizes so let's add this as
46:25 - we'll just go with h4 it's just like we
46:27 - did before and we can even pull over the
46:30 - styles as well let's see I'm not gonna
46:40 - put anything in these for now let's see
46:45 - so if we have about 50 majors and we're
46:47 - gonna have five of these categories then
46:49 - I need like 10 items in here 2 4 6 8 10
46:56 - okay why is my my indentation is crazy
47:10 - well it'll the indentation will get
47:12 - fixed on save okay so for this grid item
47:21 - yeah this will actually work this this
47:24 - will work as is we just need to copy
47:26 - this over a few times should this get
47:33 - rid of these so let's copy this
47:42 - you know we may as well make let's fill
47:46 - in something so we can actually see it
47:48 - on the page there yeah
48:00 - the three one two three four five so for
48:05 - these ones down here these grids we're
48:09 - going to switch this up and we're gonna
48:12 - leave as four but we want to offset them
48:15 - okay so let's look up how we make do
48:18 - this offset grid so we're gonna check
48:24 - out grid this is material UI I'm gonna
48:27 - put the link in here to where I'm
48:28 - looking this up in the chat that way you
48:30 - can check this out as well so I'm
48:33 - assuming there's an offset because that
48:37 - seems like something people would want
48:39 - right let's okay so we may there's no
48:55 - offset built in we could just add a an
49:06 - empty grid grid tag let's let's check
49:11 - the API and see what we have
49:34 - all right let's try this
49:39 - so I want a grid so this is one two
49:49 - three so in between three and four let's
49:54 - put another grid let's remove everything
49:56 - though I actually don't need this ending
50:03 - so let's remove everything and on
50:05 - extra-small let's say it's zero I don't
50:08 - know that we can actually put zero in
50:10 - there if that's valid but I don't want
50:14 - this to take up any space if you know if
50:17 - we're on a small screen so I may be able
50:23 - to get away with putting one in there
50:27 - we'll see we'll see how it works but if
50:29 - zero works and that's what I want to go
50:31 - with first so we're going to zero but
50:33 - then on a small screen I want to do it
50:36 - like this
50:38 - so we're gonna have our two larger
50:41 - sections that we want to see that are
50:43 - going to be visible and they're gonna be
50:44 - four and four that makes eight right so
50:46 - that gives us a whole nother for that we
50:48 - have to fill up that space so that's why
50:50 - we're gonna make this one two and that's
50:53 - going to be the beginning and then at
50:55 - the end we're gonna add another blank
50:59 - grid grid item that's also gonna take up
51:02 - two columns all right let's see what
51:04 - happens I'm kind of expecting an error
51:07 - but whoa no error all right so good to
51:11 - know you can put zero as a grid item and
51:14 - let's double check and make sure that
51:15 - actually works so this is extra small
51:19 - screen size awesome awesome
51:22 - great okay so that's what we have
51:27 - doesn't look good at all
51:29 - right now but let's bring over our
51:31 - styles that we had already figured out
51:33 - went on another component and that way
51:40 - yeah
51:45 - we'll see what it looks like after so I
51:47 - was just kind of looking at the spacing
51:48 - like maybe we should Center this stuff
51:51 - because it's all over to the side but
51:53 - let's add our Styles first and then see
51:55 - what we can do so on the sample schedule
51:58 - component that we made last week we had
52:03 - this grid item so on the grid itself we
52:10 - had a style of list grid item on our UL
52:13 - we had styles list on our h4 we had list
52:17 - header and then our Li we had list item
52:20 - so we're gonna copy over quite a few
52:22 - Styles here so this grade item list list
52:30 - header and list item list item list was
52:37 - tighter than this good item area
52:39 - alright let's copy all of those and
52:42 - we'll put them up here with the rest of
52:47 - our Styles it looks like we already have
52:51 - a list item list I'll type none
53:05 - let's say let's just call it major major
53:12 - list item we just change that up a bit
53:17 - and then now on these we can add in our
53:27 - class names so let's see we can probably
53:33 - get rid of this grid item fix because
53:36 - that was for a different issue so I
53:39 - doubt we need that anymore and actually
53:45 - you know what let's get rid of these
53:46 - first because we don't need any styles
53:54 - on on these ones
54:00 - all right there we are
54:05 - so we're going to replace grid fix item
54:10 - with list grid item that we just pulled
54:13 - over we can check out what these styles
54:21 - are actually doing you know when we we
54:25 - get them all switched over
54:28 - but for now
54:37 - you
54:41 - for now I think it's better to see it
54:43 - first and then we'll explain explain it
54:46 - after you do class name classes dot list
55:02 - and then there's a ul or H fours we're
55:08 - gonna get
55:14 - really should have done this before I
55:16 - copied them all whoops
55:20 - that would have been smarter
55:29 - last name equals classes whoops that's
55:36 - not an equal sign equals classes dot
55:42 - list header
55:49 - all right and then finally allies that's
55:52 - a lot of allies we can do this we're
55:58 - going to test the limits of multiple
56:00 - cursors and we change that didn't we
56:04 - list item we change it to major list
56:07 - item right
56:23 - all right there we go class name equals
56:29 - classes dot major list item that looked
56:43 - really cool I mean I don't know that
56:46 - just look cool editing all those lines
56:47 - all at once so hopefully I didn't mess
56:50 - it up let's save it and see what it
56:51 - looks like all right not too much
56:55 - different really but we don't have any
57:00 - of those those bullets anymore let's try
57:08 - to Center this at least
57:19 - yeah it's gonna be a little bit
57:20 - difficult let's see
57:35 - well again let's just let's try the easy
57:37 - part first okay about five more minutes
57:45 - less than five minutes I'm gonna go back
57:46 - to the questions okay so let's see
58:03 - see if we can just do a
58:05 - text-align:center yeah we can awesome
58:08 - see we can do a center that's great we
58:14 - can do it on here as well this what I
58:20 - was talking about the easy thing okay we
58:23 - could do it the easy way and just have
58:24 - them all centered you know what for now
58:28 - let's let's go with that okay I I don't
58:31 - normally like to have centered things
58:32 - like this I think it looks kind of weird
58:34 - to have it like different starting
58:35 - points for the lines so the way around
58:38 - that would be if that does look really
58:39 - weird to try to just censor the list
58:45 - inside of of the div but we can already
58:49 - see like kind of an issue right because
58:54 - we're already full width so probably end
58:58 - up using some I don't know what I'd use
59:06 - but I'm not gonna worry about it now
59:08 - this should be enough that once we get
59:11 - some real names of the courses in here
59:14 - it'll be alright but I'm not gonna type
59:18 - out manually all the names of all of
59:21 - these right that's that would be crazy
59:23 - yeah I just did this manually just so we
59:26 - could get a nice look of what we're
59:29 - doing right so at first we're gonna
59:32 - build this out and it is gonna be a lot
59:35 - of markup here but then eventually all
59:38 - this data will be pulled in from our
59:42 - content management system so there
59:45 - really will be nothing but just the bare
59:47 - bones in this component so you wouldn't
59:50 - you want to normally want to leave it
59:52 - like that
59:53 - where you have so much going on you know
59:55 - in one component
60:02 - okay
60:07 - all right and I should only have a few
60:09 - minutes left two minutes all right what
60:12 - do we do for two minutes
60:13 - I know we do for two minutes we commit
60:21 - this stuff so I don't forget so you get
60:23 - status all right we can see what we've
60:26 - done we've edited the hero component we
60:29 - added the functionality to be able to
60:31 - pass in the minimum height as a prop all
60:33 - right we worked on the server just to
60:35 - get the route 1 where we wanted and then
60:37 - we've also added in this new component
60:39 - admission CAS so let's get add and I'm
60:45 - gonna just add in a dot because that
60:47 - puts everything in there
60:48 - wait Nietzsche says github is down whoa
60:52 - github is down
61:02 - it's working for me maybe it's just down
61:10 - regionally let me know is it down
61:15 - how many people have github down right
61:18 - now let me know in the chat I mean I'm
61:20 - gonna try to push either way but
61:28 - okay so it is working for some people
61:30 - well hopefully it'll work for us okay so
61:35 - we're gonna add a little commit message
61:36 - here to be a new feature and say add
61:45 - admissions page component
61:50 - alright this that works
61:56 - all right and my time he was just
61:58 - starting to go off so that means I have
61:59 - about 20 seconds left
62:12 - so we have something set up here that it
62:14 - will automatically format our code and
62:16 - it will run some tests assuming
62:19 - everything passes then we're good to go
62:21 - with this commit so if you do want to
62:25 - work on this on your own computer then
62:28 - just be aware that all this will happen
62:31 - when you try to commit using yarn cm
62:35 - instead of the normal method of
62:37 - committing it looks like everything
62:38 - passed and let's see if we can get this
62:40 - to push to github hey it worked ok so
62:48 - I'm guessing maybe github is down
62:52 - regionally I mean that kind of makes
62:56 - sense it would be odd if github goes
62:57 - down everywhere but I mean not unheard
63:00 - of but okay all right so that's the the
63:07 - timer for y'all didn't hear the time I
63:12 - heard the timer so anyway timers up so
63:15 - now I'm gonna go to the chat and pick up
63:20 - where you left off and answer all the
63:21 - questions that are there it's about 2
63:24 - o'clock p.m. Eastern time so it's my
63:27 - time I have a meeting at 3 p.m. so I can
63:32 - answer questions for about 45 minutes if
63:35 - I have that many questions
63:47 - all right so let's get to it
64:04 - okay so Phoenix asks a little bit about
64:08 - an grok like the how and why of it so
64:12 - and Rock is a service that allows you to
64:15 - run something locally on your machine
64:18 - share a link and then somebody else can
64:22 - see what you're working on as you're
64:25 - working on it so you make changes you
64:27 - save it in your editor it automatically
64:29 - shows up on their screen so you can
64:33 - imagine this would be really useful for
64:37 - like showing a client updates you know
64:41 - potentially if if your pair programming
64:44 - or something like that and you want to
64:49 - see I'm say like pair programming
64:52 - remotely right and you want to be able
64:55 - to see the changes you know immediately
64:57 - I have the other person see the changes
64:59 - immediately and be able to inspect it
65:01 - and dev tools right it works and it
65:03 - works out really well for this live
65:05 - stream so that you all also have access
65:06 - to all the changes immediately without
65:08 - me having to push it to a server
65:10 - somewhere how that works internally I
65:14 - have no idea
65:32 - Jovie says have you done a high fidelity
65:34 - prototype you mean like like a sketch
65:41 - file this interactive type of prototype
65:44 - no we didn't I don't remember if we did
65:49 - some of that earlier on but at this
65:53 - point no I just go right from the little
65:55 - sketch I did and we have enough
65:57 - components that we can kind of go right
65:59 - into this to be honest with you it's
66:04 - faster for me to just throw up some code
66:08 - like this and adjust it a little bit
66:10 - than to do this in sketch or something
66:13 - like sketch so as long as if I was doing
66:17 - some like really different design it
66:20 - probably wouldn't be the case but with
66:21 - with these design elements and material
66:23 - design in general I've worked with it so
66:25 - much that it is faster for me just to
66:29 - code things and with material UI we have
66:33 - so many pre-built things so I didn't I
66:35 - didn't really see the need to do a
66:36 - prototype first
66:43 - all right Divya says hello everyone
66:47 - after getting out 40-plus interviews
66:49 - with node and Express I finally started
66:52 - learning react and also bought Steven
66:57 - critters course on udemy I've read a few
67:01 - media mill articles as well awesome
67:04 - that's really awesome congratulations
67:10 - let's see Christmas's looks really weird
67:14 - on laptop sighs all right I don't
67:17 - remember what part looks weird the whole
67:19 - thing or a specific part of the page let
67:22 - me know Divi s asked if I had a haircut
67:24 - I did I got a haircut laughs last week I
67:27 - told him to go really short so it still
67:29 - looks like it's a fresh haircut thanks
67:32 - for noticing what do you all think
67:33 - haircut
67:35 - good bad let me know in the chat it's
67:44 - super-important which I'll think about
67:45 - my haircut
67:58 - Chris says no the smaller viewport
68:01 - height on the admissions page oh okay so
68:05 - you're saying the hero section with a
68:08 - smaller height looks weird okay yeah I
68:16 - could see how potentially if we had a
68:18 - wider screen that was a little bit short
68:20 - it might look weird I I really think
68:24 - it's what it's going to happen is this
68:25 - going to end up depending on what image
68:27 - we have here and we'll adjust the height
68:28 - to fit the image but we'll see
68:51 - alright it says there's bad there's no
68:53 - subtitles yeah sorry about that I don't
68:55 - know how we would subtitle a live a live
68:58 - stream
68:59 - I mean potentially if we get somebody to
69:01 - add subtitles afterwards at least the
69:03 - recordings can be subtitled but
69:08 - unfortunately I only speak English
69:13 - alright DVS says please suggest some
69:16 - kind of learning approach I should be
69:17 - open to while going forward or three-act
69:19 - yes the best advice I have for learning
69:23 - and this is not just with react but
69:25 - everything is try to do a little bit
69:27 - every day
69:27 - so it's always fresh in your mind if you
69:30 - can avoid it you know don't do like
69:32 - every Saturday I'm gonna do a bunch of
69:34 - stuff and then I'm not gonna do anything
69:36 - else with it all week right you will
69:38 - forget so much you know you'll learn but
69:41 - not nearly as fast as if you broke that
69:43 - down instead of doing like 8 hours on
69:45 - Saturday you did you know about an hour
69:47 - every day
69:50 - so I'd stick to something like that and
69:52 - then just be consistent with it
70:03 - michael says i was wondering whether you
70:05 - could use that card theme on the faculty
70:06 - list page also it would keep the site's
70:09 - theme consistent yeah we might be able
70:15 - to yeah I didn't think about that but
70:19 - you're right we could definitely just
70:20 - use cards for the faculty oh oh yeah
70:26 - I'll consider that I mean we already
70:29 - have that page done so I'd hate to go
70:31 - back and do more since there's so much
70:34 - else to do but I kind of do like that
70:39 - that suggestion Christopher says the
70:46 - spacing between the cards and the banner
70:48 - above them is different the spacing
70:50 - between the cards and the banner should
70:52 - be larger or equal to the spacing
70:54 - between the cards okay cool yeah let me
70:58 - stuff like that like I said we're not
71:00 - gonna worry about details right now but
71:05 - I am interested in stuff like that so
71:07 - especially like if you see issues like
71:10 - that and you have time please make a an
71:15 - issue on github on the github repo and
71:18 - then that way I can go back and check
71:21 - those out
71:31 - Aniki says I don't put much stock in
71:34 - testimonials a website puts their
71:36 - themselves they're gonna cherry pick
71:38 - most of them most of the time it still
71:40 - makes sense to put them there
71:41 - yeah you're right you're right thanks
71:43 - for sure divya says do you like those
71:50 - cards to open as modal's like the design
71:53 - Cora had some time back but they changed
71:56 - it back to normal for you and the answer
71:58 - sometimes I like these using modal's and
72:00 - sometimes not I it just kind of depends
72:03 - on what content the content we're
72:06 - willing to and potentially so if there's
72:12 - not really a lot of content a modal does
72:13 - make sense but if there's enough content
72:15 - for a separate page I like having a
72:17 - separate page with its own URL just for
72:22 - for SEO purposes I like that
72:38 - michael says put the cards in a div then
72:40 - adding a line items stretch to the div
72:45 - should make them all the same height
72:47 - shouldn't it yeah you know what Michael
72:50 - I I know we've handled this issue before
72:52 - so I was kind of thinking of just going
72:55 - back to some of the older code and
72:57 - seeing like how did we fix that but
72:59 - you're right it's gonna be something
73:00 - like that that'll make all these the
73:02 - same what'll end up happening though is
73:04 - you know there'll be some space at the
73:07 - bottom so no matter what it's gonna look
73:09 - a little audit but I'd rather have white
73:11 - space below this and the card come down
73:14 - here then to obviously have the cards be
73:17 - different it's it's slightly less weird
73:20 - to have the same height of the cards
73:23 - with white space at the bottom of the
73:24 - card
73:34 - let's see Krister Braun says 15 to 1
73:37 - student faculty ratio is not centered
73:40 - vertically yeah you right it does look a
73:43 - little bit off huh yeah like that's
73:51 - another thing that's like a perfect
73:53 - issue right because that's an easy fix
73:56 - that either I could clean up one day
73:58 - when I will have a few minutes and I try
74:00 - to get you know just figure out
74:02 - something I can do in five minutes or if
74:04 - somebody else especially somebody who's
74:06 - a beginner wants to contribute to a
74:07 - project they can pick that up and you
74:10 - know submit a pull request for that as
74:11 - well
74:18 - to one I'm not sure how to pronounce
74:20 - that correctly but tu a an with a little
74:25 - symbol over top of the a it says view
74:28 - react or angular which do you like I
74:30 - like reacts I haven't used angular since
74:33 - angular 1 was out and I wasn't that
74:38 - great with it I don't think it was
74:41 - angular's fault I think it was just my
74:43 - inexperience I haven't tried view but
74:46 - I've heard good things so really I can
74:48 - only I only have experience with reacts
74:51 - so but I do really like using react new
74:58 - sources do we need to connect project
75:00 - one two three or should we follow
75:02 - project five yeah all the projects are
75:05 - separate projects so you don't have to
75:08 - go through project one two and three
75:10 - you could go to directly to project five
75:13 - if you like or you could you know you
75:15 - just check out video titles and and see
75:18 - if there's certain topics that you want
75:20 - to learn more about but each project is
75:24 - slightly different in terms of the
75:25 - technology that we've used so maybe you
75:31 - know just want to check out each project
75:33 - to see what we're using and then you
75:35 - know watch the one that you're most
75:37 - interested in
75:40 - noble savage says hi oh hi Jesse love to
75:44 - all hey how's it going thanks for
75:47 - joining us
75:56 - see
76:09 - Krister says add a search function a
76:13 - simple filter are we talking about a
76:18 - search for majors I kind of I want them
76:26 - to be displayed so I mean we already
76:28 - have like a site-wide search but you can
76:31 - actually click to say like I just want
76:33 - to search for majors so that's already
76:35 - there you know and it's already going to
76:38 - be accessible from this page but here is
76:41 - more like look at all the stuff we have
76:44 - so I kind of want users to be able to
76:47 - see it all I'm assuming that that's what
76:49 - you're talking about was the the list of
76:51 - majors
77:00 - Hill says wood is react I'm new here
77:04 - react is a JavaScript library that helps
77:09 - you to build progressive web apps so
77:14 - it's kind of hard to explain if you want
77:17 - to get into more detail you check out
77:18 - the react website you could read a lot
77:21 - about it
77:21 - but you know the short story is it's
77:26 - just another way to make to build
77:28 - websites or apps using javascript so
77:32 - it's just kind of like a certain pattern
77:33 - and way of you know building your app
77:43 - like who says we've been working on the
77:46 - search for months and still haven't got
77:48 - it looking good yeah we're gonna have to
77:50 - go back to the search soon we I finally
77:53 - have part of the reason why we put it on
77:56 - hold is I didn't have the data set up
77:58 - like I needed to for the search to
78:00 - actually be like 100% functional but now
78:04 - I do have the data set up so now it
78:07 - makes more sense to go back in and
78:08 - finish it and try to make it look as
78:11 - good as we can
78:28 - see
78:32 - Julio says you use any react extension
78:35 - to format JSX automatically yeah we have
78:39 - some Auto formatting going on with es
78:41 - lint like on on save with the visual
78:47 - studio code plugins and we also have
78:51 - using what is it husky prettier in ES
78:55 - lint whenever we commit it Auto formats
78:59 - the code so no matter what code kind of
79:01 - code you write if you go to commit it
79:03 - it's going to format it in the style
79:05 - that that we like which is we're using
79:07 - standard standard Jas style which is
79:13 - kind of nice because you can do it
79:15 - however you want in terms of you know
79:17 - tabs spaces semicolons no semicolons it
79:21 - doesn't matter
79:22 - it'll all be put into the same style
79:24 - once it gets committed
79:44 - okay cool Nikki says using the extra
79:48 - small zero like we did here would
79:52 - probably be the same thing as false
79:54 - sincere as a false e value cool I didn't
79:57 - think about it I mean I the way it
79:59 - worked so that's that's cool but yeah
80:05 - you're right
80:17 - michael says since you know they're
80:19 - working delete all but one moderate and
80:21 - then copy and paste that yeah oh you
80:23 - mean all these lists yeah yeah I'll do
80:26 - that I mean I just we didn't have time
80:27 - today during the stream but that's the
80:31 - the next step is basically getting rid
80:35 - of all of these turning one of them into
80:39 - a component so it'll be in its own
80:42 - component and then importing that
80:44 - component and just iterating over the
80:48 - data which will probably pull the data
80:51 - in from a content management system
80:54 - which we happen to be using WordPress
80:56 - and we'll use graph QL or the REST API
81:00 - to pull the data in we'll just map over
81:03 - at all it'll come in in JSON format and
81:05 - then it'll put out onto the page as many
81:11 - of these as we want and we won't have to
81:14 - have it cluttered up with with all this
81:16 - markup it'll basically just be like this
81:19 - you know one line with a couple of props
81:21 - and that way this component will stay
81:24 - you know nice and small easily readable
81:30 - if you want to see like how to do
81:32 - something like that you can check out
81:33 - some of the previous videos I'm pretty
81:35 - sure we just did that exact thing last
81:38 - week
81:45 - and see okay Chris or says the code
81:51 - you're writing is redundant store at
81:52 - least an array of arrays and iterate
81:55 - yeah yeah that's exactly right
81:59 - Chris's use dot map yeah Christopher
82:02 - that's so if you check out our other
82:04 - components that's exactly what we've
82:06 - what we've been doing so I guess a good
82:11 - example is like our drawer menu so the
82:14 - entire side navigation menu is it's here
82:18 - as an array of objects and then you know
82:24 - when it actually you know the actual
82:26 - component is just one component that
82:28 - just gets printed out you know over and
82:30 - over again but when I'm what I'm trying
82:34 - to nail down the design I always like to
82:37 - do it like this first because it just
82:39 - gives me a lot more control it I don't
82:43 - have to worry about all the props are
82:45 - passing in and things like that it's
82:47 - just you know I'm just putting markup on
82:50 - the page and I'm editing it you know
82:52 - it's it's really simple once I have it
82:56 - to the point where it's like okay I like
82:58 - this you know I think I'm definitely
83:00 - gonna go with this then I turn it into a
83:02 - component and then after that we can
83:04 - always edit it a bit but for now it's
83:11 - just kind of testing it out you know my
83:13 - name is like don't make another
83:15 - component if you're not sure if you even
83:16 - need that that on the page yet if you're
83:18 - even going to use it
83:46 - all right ladies singing so Phoenix is
83:48 - saying instead of selecting all the Li
83:50 - tags one by one you could use command
83:52 - control G what so what does that do
83:57 - what's the command controls G do
84:31 - last my place or it autoscroll me down
84:34 - to the bottom
84:44 - okay so officially it seems like github
84:47 - is working now for most of you so maybe
84:50 - it was down briefly amir says we can
84:59 - have some fake data objects for now
85:01 - until we get to CMS ready yeah we could
85:04 - I mean since I already have this data in
85:09 - the CMS I think it'd be okay yeah we
85:12 - could just pull it from the CMS but for
85:16 - now I was really more worried about like
85:18 - what would my idea for aligning these
85:22 - even look right at all would it look
85:24 - terrible so that was kind of more what
85:27 - we were trying to get there but I would
85:29 - actually like to see it with the real
85:31 - the real data so that will probably be
85:37 - after I turn it into its own component
85:39 - the next step would then be to pull in
85:42 - the real data David said how did you
85:48 - fill in those Li simultaneously okay so
85:52 - we used I don't know what the shortcut
85:55 - is on ever for everything but I can
85:57 - select this text and then on a Mac I
86:00 - press command D and it selects the next
86:04 - instance of that particular string you
86:09 - know all the way down so I can keep
86:11 - selecting it so normally you only use it
86:15 - for like two or three things in this
86:18 - case I don't know I thought it was kind
86:20 - of cool to try it out on a bunch of
86:22 - things just to see how it worked and it
86:24 - worked fine there was no lag or anything
86:25 - so and it looked I thought it kind of
86:28 - looked cool to have it all typing out so
86:30 - yeah normally I would probably do a find
86:33 - and replace if it were more but it just
86:37 - so happened it was pretty easy to just
86:40 - go away down with the with command D
86:51 - lenovo says how you doing Jesse it's me
86:54 - Anna I am doing well I always enjoy your
86:57 - stream enough how come your name's
87:02 - Lenovo yoga now on here anyway thanks
87:05 - for watching and I'm glad you're doing
87:09 - well
87:11 - it also says nice nice haircut Thanks
87:31 - see
87:34 - Ahmir says can we get that live link
87:36 - sure the end rock link yeah sorry about
87:41 - that I pasted it in earlier but I'm not
87:43 - sure if those of you who joined later
87:45 - can see it or not so I'll paste that in
87:48 - again and we also have the dev site
87:56 - which is not quite as up-to-date but we
88:03 - have our dev site available too and
88:05 - that's it shouldn't be that slow I'm
88:11 - pretty sure I said it to always have an
88:13 - instance open with next so it shouldn't
88:16 - have to load up a new instance anyway
88:31 - michael says don't adjust the height to
88:33 - fit the image adjust the image to fit
88:35 - the height well what I was thinking
88:38 - Michael is it's possible that I might
88:41 - have to put a certain image in like
88:44 - somebody higher up than me might say you
88:46 - have to use this image and then I'll be
88:47 - stuck with an image so I'll have to make
88:50 - it work so yeah so I may not have the
88:53 - ability to choose what image I want
89:14 - Phoenix says what exactly is firebase
89:17 - and flutter
89:18 - okay so firebase is a Google service I
89:25 - people is it normally used for apps as
89:30 - like like a database for apps I'm not
89:35 - sure what people normally use it for but
89:36 - I'm I think it's normally for apps so
89:39 - it's it's like a database-as-a-service
89:41 - thing flutter so flutter is really new
89:49 - as far as I know and I haven't learned
89:52 - very much about it at all
89:54 - what I'm pretty sure it's a way to make
89:57 - apps and that's that's about all I know
90:01 - so I haven't learned anything about
90:03 - flutter yet other than that and that
90:05 - might night of it might not be the case
90:07 - so don't take my word for it
90:17 - Christopher Brown says no reason to use
90:19 - cards for faculty this in my opinion
90:21 - okay cool yeah like I said I think I
90:26 - probably won't put the cards in now just
90:28 - because we have so much other stuff to
90:31 - work on and the faculty list looks okay
90:32 - right now
90:33 - so for those of you who haven't been
90:37 - following the project this is a very
90:38 - very big site so the strategy right now
90:42 - is to get all the data there make sure
90:44 - it's accessible and seo-friendly
90:48 - and it looks decent and it's fast step 2
90:52 - after we launch is to go into each
90:54 - section meet with the people at the
90:57 - University who would be in charge of
91:00 - each section like you know that's their
91:02 - department or the professors that teach
91:03 - these courses and then figure out how we
91:08 - can best style things and what content
91:11 - we should put on there to make it as
91:13 - good as it can be so we'll kind of
91:15 - slowly go through there and then train
91:17 - those people to edit the content through
91:19 - WordPress so the old website is just so
91:25 - slow and it's not great on mobile that
91:28 - any pretty much anything we do will be a
91:31 - big improvement so if it seems like I'm
91:34 - being a bit sloppy with the details I
91:36 - mean that's that's kind of the point is
91:39 - that we just need this thing to be done
91:41 - and it doesn't need to be perfect
91:42 - because it's you know within the next
91:45 - few months we're gonna be going through
91:46 - some sections and changing them
91:48 - completely
91:54 - alright thirsty pooch says I have got a
91:58 - question
91:59 - when using nodejs on windows and some
92:02 - exercises which include such as gulp
92:07 - when I try to run go up
92:09 - I get module not found why is this
92:11 - should I use yarn get module not found
92:17 - when you try to run go up I guess you'd
92:22 - need to have make sure you have gulp
92:24 - installed you would yeah you shouldn't
92:27 - you should definitely run npm install or
92:31 - yarn first to make sure that it's gulp
92:34 - is installed that would be my guess i'm
92:37 - it's hard to say without you know seeing
92:39 - the project see what's going on but yeah
92:41 - definitely make sure that you act you do
92:45 - have gulp installed like try and your
92:47 - command line running gulp and then
92:49 - putting space - v to see if it'll give
92:54 - you your version of gulp if it doesn't
92:56 - then maybe gulps honest though
93:06 - let's see
93:14 - see
93:17 - I think I'm almost through you checked
93:20 - my time ok still pretty good on time so
93:24 - I may be able to answer a few more
93:25 - questions before my meeting
93:38 - Ahmir says I tried angular react in view
93:41 - and in my experience I found view better
93:44 - you can say it's the best of both worlds
93:46 - alright that's interesting I definitely
93:48 - like to try view at some point it's just
93:50 - you know all my projects now have been
93:53 - react to kind of make sense for me to
93:55 - just try to get better at react because
93:57 - I have a lot of things now that I'm
93:58 - gonna have to maintain you in react but
94:02 - maybe for a side project or something
94:04 - but small something small I could try
94:07 - out you Dex Troyer of world says SAS or
94:13 - styled components I haven't decided on
94:17 - what my favorite way to style react
94:19 - components is honestly I've tried a few
94:23 - different ways and I just I keep trying
94:26 - more ways so within the same project
94:28 - I've done like two or three different
94:30 - ways I'm still trying to decide
95:00 - Ivo says what's p5d 88 that's project 5
95:05 - day 88 so this is the fifth project
95:08 - we've done on this live stream and it is
95:11 - day 88 of the project we really stream
95:15 - 88 so I don't stream every day but we've
95:19 - been working on this project for about
95:20 - six or seven months something like that
95:33 - all right Krista Brown says to make
95:35 - cards same height on profile card set
95:38 - high to 100% okay cool I'm gonna alright
95:46 - I was good about to try but maybe I want
95:48 - to try it right now cuz I need to make
95:49 - sure I get through these questions but
95:51 - thank you for that
95:55 - okay so Phoenix saying that the shortcut
95:59 - he gave earlier was for selecting all
96:03 - instances of that particular those
96:08 - particular characters okay cool I'll
96:12 - have to try that all right Christopher
96:18 - says view is better but it's a little
96:20 - weirder to learn than react okay
96:22 - our sim says jQuery is still the best
96:27 - hey I made a bunch of stuff in jQuery
96:30 - before I learned react so I still have
96:33 - things that I maintain that her jQuery
96:34 - based
96:42 - Krister says you're composed thing is
96:45 - like SAS in JavaScript I like it that
96:47 - way much easier to use Christopher says
96:57 - jQuery isn't relevant anymore I don't
97:00 - know I if you're building new stuff yeah
97:05 - I'm not gonna use jQuery but there are a
97:06 - lot of sites that are out there that use
97:10 - jQuery so I guess it depends on what
97:12 - you're working on like the odds of going
97:14 - into an existing project and having to
97:17 - use some jQuery are pretty good I mean I
97:20 - don't know what the current stats are
97:22 - but I mean it I think it's still the
97:26 - majority of websites on the internet
97:27 - have jQuery on them so yeah I would
97:32 - never pick jQuery if I were making
97:34 - something new but like I said I still
97:37 - have to maintain sites at at jQuery so
97:39 - it's definitely still good to know it
97:41 - because you'll probably see it and and
97:44 - work on it
97:51 - and I mean shoot like before reacts and
97:54 - all that I mean jQuery was where it was
97:55 - at
98:08 - Anoop says have you tried styled
98:10 - components does it work with Internet
98:12 - Explorer the last time I use styled
98:14 - components was for react native so I
98:16 - don't really I never tested it obviously
98:19 - Internet Explorer so I'm not I'm not
98:21 - sure about that does anybody know I
98:25 - don't see why it wouldn't work you know
98:29 - assuming that the content the markup
98:34 - they gets spit out and actually sent to
98:36 - the browser is something that Internet
98:40 - Explorer could use I it definitely could
98:44 - work skip monday says hello from Nigeria
98:48 - hey how's it going thanks for watching a
98:50 - mere says view combined angularjs and
98:54 - react so if you know both I guess it's
98:57 - fine such V if or ng if and mount
99:03 - component did mount so as I said it's
99:05 - best of both worlds Phoenix says I have
99:12 - a tampermonkey script which checks for
99:14 - jQuery on websites a lot of site still
99:16 - has it
99:17 - yeah sure Krister says the problem with
99:21 - jQuery is that it contains a bunch of
99:22 - bloat that you probably won't be using
99:23 - and that slows down a lot of sites like
99:26 - I was applying for a job and I checked
99:28 - their site and it was slow I even did an
99:31 - audit on it jQuery is the main problem
99:32 - oh yeah for sure yeah like I said I'm
99:35 - not gonna pick jQuery now for a new
99:38 - project
99:39 - but it's I wouldn't ignore jQuery in
99:44 - terms of like knowing about it knowing
99:47 - basics about jQuery just because like if
99:50 - you're a freelancer and you work on
99:53 - existing sites for people you're gonna
99:55 - see jQuery right if you're going to go
99:59 - work for a large company that's not like
100:02 - one of the big tech companies you're
100:05 - probably gonna work with jQuery right
100:07 - there there are very few companies that
100:10 - don't have jQuery going on somewhere
100:25 - let's see Anoop says what are your
100:30 - thoughts on the server-side render react
100:32 - oh I almost always use server-side
100:35 - rendering reacts because it's a must for
100:37 - search engine optimization okay so I
100:40 - there's a nice performance benefit on
100:42 - initial load as well but mainly like you
100:45 - need that server-side render rendering
100:49 - for search engines to be able to see
100:51 - your content if you're pulling it from
100:54 - api's so yeah I definitely recommend
100:57 - that and for me you know over the last
101:02 - year - the easiest way to do that has
101:04 - been just to use next jazz because it
101:06 - has it it works automatically you don't
101:09 - have to set it up
101:17 - Ahmir says the fun part is angular uses
101:20 - jQuery even it has internal JQ Lite
101:23 - thing in it when jQuery is not available
101:25 - yeah you're right
101:26 - did they still have that I remember an
101:28 - angular one they did have that that they
101:30 - had their own version of jQuery built-in
101:35 - Aamir says I decided to make my own
101:37 - version of jQuery with es6 that's cool
101:45 - Christopher says I preferred you as much
101:47 - coding as possible in CSS so that the
101:48 - JavaScript doesn't slow down the site oh
101:50 - yeah for sure CSS is definitely more
101:53 - performant than than JavaScript so it's
101:58 - good to know all the ways you can use
102:01 - CSS to do things that frequently do get
102:04 - done with with JavaScript
102:13 - crow says server-side rendering is not
102:17 - better for a landing page and SEO
102:18 - question mark I'm not sure what the
102:22 - question is yes server-side rendering
102:26 - yeah I'm not exactly sure what the
102:28 - question is so just say like with
102:30 - without server-side rendering if you're
102:33 - trying to run a react app and you're
102:35 - pulling your data in from an API these
102:38 - the crawler right your search engine
102:41 - BOTS that's going to go to your site
102:43 - it's not going to stick around long
102:44 - enough to wait for the data to come back
102:46 - from that API call it's gonna look at it
102:49 - and it's gonna see basically no content
102:51 - whatever content you are pulling from
102:53 - the API isn't going to be there so it's
102:56 - not gonna index those things in search
102:58 - so that's why you need to be rendered
103:00 - server side and then will get sent to
103:02 - the client is going to be HTML right
103:06 - HTML CSS whatever you know so that's why
103:11 - you you want that if you have a project
103:16 - where you don't care about the SEO then
103:21 - maybe you don't want to do server-side
103:22 - rendering I've done projects where I
103:24 - didn't need SEO so I didn't but you know
103:29 - for me that's the main reason why I do
103:30 - server-side rendering okay I've gotten
103:38 - to the end of the chat just in time to
103:41 - get some data prepared for my next
103:43 - meeting and let's see all right we have
103:50 - some further discussion in there about s
103:53 - CSS and things like that okay all right
104:00 - I'm an industry now I will probably
104:02 - streaming in tomorrow thank you all so
104:05 - much for watching and for all your help
104:07 - in the in the live chat so get a little
104:12 - bit done today not you know not totally
104:15 - finished with this page but we got a
