00:00 - Hi, and welcome to this course called Excel from 
the beginning. In this course, we're going to  
00:05 - learn how to use Excel using six projects that you 
can use in real life. So my name is shad Sluiter,  
00:11 - and I've been a teacher for computer science 
and computer applications for several years,  
00:16 - what you're about to see are applications 
that I've used in my classroom, and have  
00:20 - been successful with other students in the past. 
So I really appreciate the opportunity that Free  
00:26 - Code Camp has given me to present this to you. 
I have used Free Code Camp in my own classroom,  
00:32 - with success with students from high school to 
the university level. And so we're going to see  
00:38 - part of what I've done in class. And I'm glad to 
contribute back to help you as well. Let's take a  
00:44 - look at some of the projects that we'll build in 
this course. So Excel from the beginning is going  
00:48 - to use six projects, the first one, and it'll be 
the most basic will be to set up a payroll. So  
00:53 - imagine if you were a company and trying to pay 
your employees and keep track of their overtime.  
00:58 - So that's what we'll do in this first project. The 
second is to set up a gradebook. And so we'll be  
01:04 - doing computing on percentages, we'll be finding 
who's in the top of our class and who's not.  
01:08 - Also we'll have a factor decision tree factoring 
program. So we will try to decide what career  
01:14 - would be best based on what we prefer, what the 
pay is and other benefits of a job. And so a  
01:20 - spreadsheet will help us determine how to make 
a decision. Another application we'll create is  
01:24 - a sales database. And so I will give you a bunch 
of data and we will sort that we will determine  
01:29 - who are the best salespeople what their commission 
is, and make some charts, we'll also do what's  
01:34 - called a car inventory project where we'll create 
what's called database actions, we're going to  
01:39 - have a large number of data again, and we can show 
you how to concatenate fields, how to split them,  
01:46 - and how to make reports with this. And then 
lastly, I'm going to reserve this section for  
01:52 - six different problems that we're going to solve. 
So the first five projects are more tutorials to  
01:58 - show you how something is done. And then I'm going 
to give you some challenge assignments at the end,  
02:03 - where I give you a half of a solution. And then 
you use your creativity in what you've learned in  
02:08 - the previous courses to see if you can solve the 
problem. And so both we have a tutorial section,  
02:15 - as well as a practice where you can put things 
into service. Now let's take a look at some of  
02:20 - the things you'll learn throughout here. So some 
of the terms, you'll learn from the very beginning  
02:24 - how to enter data, how to navigate through a 
spreadsheet, and how to save it. Also, I'm going  
02:29 - to show you how to set up formulas because using 
math formulas, simple formulas to solve problems,  
02:35 - such as how to compute overtime, or how to 
compute the percent that a salesperson should  
02:41 - get on commission, or to simply do averages and to 
find the maximums and minimums. So those are basic  
02:47 - formulas will create charts. So you'll have pie 
charts and line charts, and you'll have scatter  
02:52 - charts, Excel is really easy and creating charts, 
you basically have to choose what kind you want.  
02:58 - And it does it for you. Also, we're going to 
do Excel with some more advanced features.  
03:03 - So relative and absolute references is used 
if you have some kind of a factor that you  
03:09 - want to use and other parts of the spreadsheet. 
And so that's another feature that we'll see.  
03:14 - We're going to do imports and exports of 
data. So CSV is a common file you find on  
03:20 - the internet. So maybe your bank statement comes 
to you in the mail, or at least online, I guess.  
03:25 - And it says we produce these items in CSV 
format as if you know what CSV format is.  
03:32 - So I'll show you how to use this. And so you can 
interface with other programs on the internet,  
03:36 - we're using something called v lookup. So v 
lookup is a powerful tool that is like searching  
03:42 - through a menu to find the right item for your 
choice. Also, we're going to use pivot tables,  
03:48 - pivot tables are summary reports. So if you have 
a large amount of data, and you want to condense  
03:54 - it to a very readable decision, this is kind of 
a big data tool. So the last one is to split text  
04:01 - and concatenate text. And so you can modify 
things according to how you want them to be.  
04:08 - So that's some of the features that were ahead 
of us. If this looks interesting to you, then  
04:11 - please let's continue on with the first lesson. 
So here's the first lesson, we're going to work  
04:16 - with something called payroll. And you can see 
that we're going to set up a group of employees,  
04:21 - we're going to give them some fake numbers, 
their hourly wage, and calculate once again,  
04:28 - with fake numbers, how many hours they worked, 
then we're going to take those numbers and use  
04:33 - some simple formulas to fill in these columns 
of data where we can see how much they get paid.  
04:38 - Also, I'll show you shortcuts so that large 
numbers of columns and rows get rather tedious but  
04:46 - there are shortcuts in Excel to make it work fast. 
So let's get started with our first lesson ever  
04:51 - an Excel so this particular lesson on Excel the 
beginning parts of how to use Excel has been seen  
04:58 - over a million times. on my YouTube channel, so 
welcome. If you haven't seen it before, this is a  
05:03 - great way to start using Excel, we're going to use 
Excel to create a spreadsheet for our business.  
05:10 - We're going to launch the program and start 
a blank workbook. Now since this is the first  
05:15 - assignment that we're going to do with Microsoft 
Excel, we need to go through some of the things  
05:19 - that you see in any spreadsheet. First of all, the 
spreadsheet is designed in organized according to  
05:24 - cells. Just like in the game battleship where you 
have columns that are letters and rows that are  
05:29 - numbers, you can identify cells such as this one 
by such as G six. To enter in information into a  
05:37 - cell, you simply click it and start typing. 
And so I'm going to type employee payroll,  
05:46 - press Enter. And you notice that this cell, 
even though it extends into column B, really,  
05:53 - it is only in a one. Now let's use Excel as 
a payroll, we're going to keep track of the  
06:00 - hours that our employees worked this week. And 
we'll keep track of their wages. So first of all,  
06:06 - we need to put some column headings 
in. So I'm going to put in the title,  
06:10 - last name, and then first name. And then I'm 
pressing tab between these keys so that it moves,  
06:18 - the selection moves to the right, hourly 
wage. And then I'm going to put in the date,  
06:24 - let's say January 1, and press enter. Over here, 
I'm going to say that this is the hours worked.  
06:34 - And this is their total pay. So I'll just put 
the word pay. Now you notice you can expand a  
06:40 - column by clicking between the column headers like 
between D and E. Now you can see the whole word.  
06:49 - The next thing you need to do is you need to 
invent some names. So you get to come up with  
06:54 - about 20 names, maybe 15 for your employees. 
I'll type them in now. Now you can see that  
07:00 - I've invented names, last names and first names. 
And now I'm going to give them an hourly wage,  
07:06 - each person makes a route $15 or so. So I'll type 
in some numbers here. You notice when you type in  
07:14 - numbers, they are right justified when you type 
in the person's name in your spreadsheet, that  
07:19 - they are left justified. That's just a convention 
that Microsoft Excel uses so that you can identify  
07:25 - letters versus numbers. Now one of the items that 
you will most commonly use in Excel is formatting.  
07:34 - These are all hourly wages, I'm going to select 
this range with my mouse by clicking and dragging.  
07:41 - The first square is actually highlighted even 
though it's white, the other ones are gray. But  
07:46 - what I want to do is change them into a currency. 
So I'm going to click on the dollar sign up here.  
07:50 - And you notice that they all become dollar signs. 
They all are the hourly wage for each employee.  
07:58 - Now let's invent a number for each of 
the employees for how long they worked.  
08:02 - The average workweek for a full time person is 
about 40 hours. So I'll create wages or sorry,  
08:10 - I'll create the number of hours that 
each person worked in this column.  
08:16 - After giving each employee a number of ours, 
we're going to start working with formulas. Now,  
08:22 - over here on this line, this square in 
e4, I'm going to create a calculated  
08:27 - number a calculated cell. If a person gets 
$15.90 an hour, and they work for 40 hours.  
08:36 - How much do they get paid? Well, fortunately, 
the calculations in Excel are quite easy to do.  
08:42 - on my keyboard, I'm going to press the 
equal sign. And you notice up here in this  
08:48 - area called the formula bar, we have an equal 
sign, as well as the equal sign in the cell.  
08:54 - Now I'm going to click on the cell that has 
the wage in it 1590. When I click there,  
09:01 - the letter C four is entered into the 
formula bar, c four is the wage $15.90.  
09:10 - Now I want to multiply 1590. So I'm going to press 
the shift and the 80, which is the multiply sign.  
09:18 - And then I'm going to click the 40 the dot 
the number of hours that this person worked.  
09:24 - So my formula is equals to c four times the 
number that's in cell D four. When I press enter,  
09:33 - it'll tell me that this person gets $636. If 
you go and change some of these numbers, such as  
09:41 - we added an hour here and I type 41 and press 
enter. That calculation is automatically updated.  
09:49 - When you double click on a cell that has 
a formula, you will see that the colors  
09:54 - correspond to the cells that you clicked. 
So c four is in blue, which is this number  
10:00 - And D four is in red. In a press ENTER 
again. And it shows the numbers again.  
10:08 - Microsoft Excel has a nice feature where you 
can copy and paste formulas. If I right click  
10:15 - on this cell and choose Copy. And then I 
click on the next cell and choose Paste,  
10:22 - it'll automatically calculate the next line. You 
can also highlight a range and choose right click  
10:30 - and paste, it will fill down where all of those 
numbers are, why is this one luckily look like  
10:36 - railroad tracks where a bunch of pound signs, it's 
because the value is actually too large to be held  
10:42 - in this in this cell. So I need to make the column 
a little bit wider. And now it becomes visible.  
10:49 - Another way to fill down if you want to, you can 
go to the corner of a cell with this little green  
10:56 - dot. And if you click exactly on the corner and 
drag your mouse down, it will also fill down the  
11:03 - values in that column. And so now I've quickly 
calculated the pay for every single employee.  
11:10 - One more thing we're going to do with this formula 
is we're going to add a few lines at the bottom.  
11:17 - I want to know who is the maximum, press enter, 
who is the minimum, press Enter? What is the  
11:24 - average pay, and what is the total pay these 
numbers max, min, average and total are just  
11:31 - labels. But over here in this column, I'm going 
to put in a corresponding formula. Microsoft Excel  
11:38 - has hundreds of formulas that are predefined. 
Here's one of them, you type in the equal sign.  
11:45 - And then you type the word MA X, you notice that 
these automatically are drop down menus that show  
11:52 - that this is one of the formulas that Excel 
knows about. After typing Max, I use the open  
11:57 - parentheses, which is the shift key and nine. And 
I'm going to drag my mouse across a range of cells  
12:07 - till they come to the very 
top, release the mouse button  
12:11 - and press Shift and zero to do a close 
parentheses. So what this will do,  
12:16 - it will give me the maximum of all 
of these cells, the maximum person  
12:22 - is getting $45 an hour. And so you can see in this 
line here that Trent man is making 45 an hour. Now  
12:30 - I'd like to know who the minimum is. So I'm going 
to do the same process type equals sign, am I N,  
12:37 - open parentheses and drag my mouse across a 
range. And I will tell it what the minimum is.  
12:45 - After I press Shift and zero, enter, and the 
lowly person in my office is getting $6.90. It  
12:54 - looks like it's Paul Smith. Now what's the average 
employee? Well, I can type in equals and then Av.  
13:02 - And you see there's a bunch of formulas for 
average, I just want this most simple one,  
13:06 - I'm going to choose average. 
I'm going to select the range,  
13:16 - close parentheses, and press enter. 
The average employee makes $16.48.  
13:25 - Okay, let's take this range here of 
three different formulas, highlight it,  
13:32 - right click it with the mouse copy. I want 
to click in the next column over right click  
13:41 - and pastes. And now you see that we have the 
maximum, the minimum and the average for the  
13:49 - number of hours that are being worked. Now you 
notice that these values are listed as dollars,  
13:54 - they're actually not dollars, they're number of 
hours that the persons are working. So I want to  
13:59 - change these formattings back to general numbers. 
Up here in the ribbon, where you will find the  
14:07 - number formatting area, there's a small arrow 
that if you click it will bring up a dialog box  
14:13 - that shows all different types of formatting for 
numbers. I'm going to select general and click OK.  
14:23 - Now, why does this number have so many decimal 
places in it? It's because it's because we are  
14:28 - computing an average. It would be nice if 
we would just round these off to maybe the  
14:34 - 10th the 10th place or the hundreds place. So 
let's go to these zeros here. And we're going to  
14:41 - decrease the decimals that we're rounding to so 
to the nearest 10th is good enough for us. So  
14:48 - now we have the number of hours maximum minimum 
and average for our employees here in column D.  
14:54 - for column E, we could also find the min the 
maximum the minimum and the average as well.  
14:59 - So let's highlight this group, I'm going to select 
this bottom right corner, drag to the right.  
15:07 - And it fills to the right now and shows me that 
these are the maximum dollars that someone made  
15:13 - the minimum dollars and the average. Once more, 
these are dollars figures, these are not hours.  
15:18 - So let's change these to the dollars format. So 
I'm going to click up here on the dollar sign.  
15:26 - And now we have the average the maximum and the 
minimum in the salary for this for this week.  
15:33 - So now we've created the maximum the minimum and 
the average for each of these columns, column C,  
15:38 - D, and E. We haven't done anything yet with a 
total. For the total, let's find out what the  
15:44 - total number of hours worked was. And let's find 
out what the total number of wages that we've paid  
15:48 - is. So for the word sum, we type equals su m, 
and that will give us the total. Let's do shift  
15:56 - and nine. And then I'm going to select a range 
here. I'm going to select all of the hours worked,  
16:04 - close parentheses and Enter. And you'll see 
that there were 695 hours worked in my shop.  
16:10 - Now I'm going to fill this to the right, and shows 
that I made a lot of more paid a lot of money  
16:18 - for my wages this week, I'm going to change 
this to $1 sign format. And it shows now $11,532  
16:28 - The last thing we should do is put our name 
at the top, so maybe c one is a good place,  
16:33 - type in your name, press enter, save the 
spreadsheet, print it. And you're done  
16:38 - with assignment number one for Excel. Welcome 
to assignment number two for Microsoft Excel,  
16:44 - we're going to extend assignment number 
one using the payroll spreadsheet that  
16:48 - we had created earlier. What I'd like to 
do in this assignment is add a new formula  
16:53 - using the if formula, and also adding the 
idea of paying overtime to our employees.  
16:59 - So you notice here in column D that we have 
the number of hours that each employee worked,  
17:04 - the first employee worked 41 hours, we're going to 
give him a bonus for his extra hour of overtime.  
17:10 - So I'm going to start by inserting a column 
here in column E. If I click the column header,  
17:16 - the entire column is selected, I can right click 
on the column header and choose the Insert button.  
17:23 - And it will now give me a new column to work with. 
The first column, column D was the hours worked.  
17:29 - Now I'm going to say this is the overtime hours. 
The overtime hours is a calculated field. So let's  
17:37 - come up with a formula that will tell us how many 
hours extra that this employee worked. At first,  
17:43 - it would seem simple, we would just say equals the 
number of hours the person worked, subtract 40.  
17:49 - And that will tell us how many hours of overtime 
this person has. It works great if you have 41.  
17:55 - But there's some errors. If you have less than 40, 
I'm going to fill the column down. And you will  
18:01 - see that when we come to Paul Smith in row number 
eight, he actually gets a negative one hours,  
18:08 - it's a negative hours that he's worked, that 
doesn't seem to work too well. What we would  
18:12 - rather give is Paul should have zero hours of 
overtime, not a negative number. So let's revise  
18:18 - the formula a little bit. So let's go up to here. 
And this time, I'm going to type in an equal sign  
18:24 - with the word if if is a command that says let's 
take a logical test, and we will a logical test is  
18:32 - either an equal sign greater than or less than, 
and then we'll give it a value depending on if  
18:37 - that test is true or not. And if it's false, we'll 
give it a different number. Watch how this works.  
18:44 - The question is, if his hours worked, 
is greater than 40. And a comma,  
18:52 - the value if it is greater than 40 
should be his hours worked minus 40.  
18:59 - Comma, and if he worked less than 40 hours, 
then let's just give him zero for this column,  
19:05 - which would be zero hours of overtime, I 
close parentheses and press rest press return.  
19:11 - So he still gets one hour of overtime. But 
now when I fill the formula down, you see that  
19:17 - the people that worked less than 40 hours gets 
zero in their form in their formula instead of  
19:23 - negative numbers. And so this is the correct 
formula for calculating overtime pay. Now,  
19:30 - how about the pay? What does that do? Let's go 
back and review this here. If I double click here,  
19:34 - you will see that this formula takes the number 
of hours hourly wage and fills it in column F.  
19:41 - That's great, but now we give them a bonus for 
working overtime. So let's create create a new  
19:46 - column and call it overtime bonus. Now in this 
formula, we're going to calculate a bonus for  
19:53 - the number of overtime hours they worked. So I'm 
going to say equals point five Use the time sign  
20:01 - point five times their hourly wage, so we're going 
to give them half of their hourly wage times the  
20:06 - number of overtime hours they worked. What that 
does is it gives us a formula to give them time  
20:12 - and a half, or one and a half times for each hour 
that they worked overtime, press enter. So since  
20:20 - john Kern earned one hour of overtime, we give him 
his full 41 hours of pay, plus an extra 50% of his  
20:30 - pay for one of those hours. Let's fill this down 
and see what we have. For the rest of the people.  
20:38 - Some of the people have zero. This one got no 
extra time bonus, because he worked 39 hours. Some  
20:46 - of these people worked 40 hours and still got zero 
time. Why? Because the formula is about how many  
20:52 - hours beyond 40 that we're calculating. So they 
got paid their full wage for the first 40 hours.  
21:00 - Now, how about the total pay, let's put 
in a new column, the total pay is simply  
21:07 - equals to their regular 40 hours of pay 
plus their overtime bonus and a return.  
21:15 - And let's use the fill down option. Some of the 
numbers are too big, so we will expand the column  
21:23 - and this is their total pay. Down here at 
the bottom, we calculated maximums minimums,  
21:29 - averages and totals. For all of these 
formulas. Let's move these to the right.  
21:35 - Calculate the totals now and see we can see 
what everybody earned including their overtime.  
21:42 - Welcome to assignment number three with Microsoft 
Excel. What you see on the screen before you is  
21:47 - a final version of the payroll spreadsheet, you 
notice that it's got a lot of cells, don't worry,  
21:54 - most of these are copied and pasted. It's an 
extension of assignment number one and two.  
22:01 - In the gray area here where you see hours 
worked. In the previous assignments, we  
22:06 - only were concerned with one week of pay. And this 
assignment, we're going to add four more weeks of  
22:14 - pay. And we were you will use calculations to find 
out how much they earned their overtime bonus,  
22:21 - and then here in the blue area, their total 
pay. So we'll start from an assignment here  
22:28 - that we did before. And we'll simply extend 
it to look like the one that you just saw.  
22:35 - Well, first of all, what we need to do is add 
some new columns. So starting in column E,  
22:41 - I'm going to right click and choose 
Insert and clicking on the column header.  
22:47 - Let's do this a few times. And will give us some 
space to work with for other weeks in the month.  
23:01 - Now starting here in column E three, I'm going 
to add seven days to this date. Notice the first  
23:08 - date that we chose was January 1, you can either 
type in January 8 for the next week, or we can  
23:14 - use a calculation, let's use a calculation 
I'm going to say this equals this square d3,  
23:22 - plus seven. And now it starts at January 8. Now 
if I use the fill command, I'm going to create  
23:33 - several more columns. And 
they're automatically calculated.  
23:41 - Next, I'm going to invent some more 
hours. These are numbers that should  
23:45 - be approximately 40. They can be a little 
less, they can be a little bit more.  
23:50 - But it doesn't matter really what the numbers 
are just so that we have some data to work with  
23:55 - for each employee. Now we've reached 
the end of our data for the number of  
24:01 - hours for each employee. It looks like I've 
created one extra column here in column II,  
24:06 - so I'm simply going to remove it by choosing 
right click on the column header and delete.  
24:16 - Now let's go to the overtime hours. We're going 
to put a date here for the week, January 1. And  
24:22 - once again, I'm going to insert some columns. You 
can actually insert columns more than one at a  
24:28 - time. If you highlight four column row headers and 
choose Insert, you get four new rows. Once again,  
24:36 - I'd like to add seven to the date that's in 
January 1, this plus seven and fill to the right.  
24:51 - Now let's add some overtime hours. Now I want to 
calculate the hours of overtime for each week.  
24:58 - Well we've already done this in the previous 
assignment with this famous if formula,  
25:02 - if d four is greater than 40, then give us the 
value of d four minus 40. Otherwise give us zero,  
25:10 - I can take this entire block and copy it, 
we're going to right click on it, choose Copy.  
25:19 - And I'm going to right click on 
the next square and choose Paste.  
25:23 - So now it's calculating the overtime 
hours for the week of January 8.  
25:28 - Let's double click on this cell. And you notice 
that we are now calculating the overtime hours  
25:35 - from this blue square the 42 hours from January 
8. So the formula automatically adjusted for the  
25:43 - column letter. This is using cell e4. I'm pressing 
escape now double clicking on this one. And you  
25:52 - notice that this cell was using this cell D for 
as its source for its numbers. So when you copy  
25:59 - and paste, Excel automatically assumes that you 
are relatively addressing columns somewhere else  
26:07 - in the spreadsheet. So if this is one cell to the 
right, then the next one is one cell to the right.  
26:15 - I'm going to copy and paste again. So I'll 
copy this row here. Copy and paste it.  
26:26 - Copy and Paste again. And paste again. So now we 
have overtime hours calculated for every week.  
26:40 - Now when you start to get a lot of cells 
on a spreadsheet, it can get confusing  
26:45 - looking at so many numbers. So Excel allows 
us to paint the cells in certain colors.  
26:52 - These cells here that I'm highlighting now are all 
related to the number of hours that they worked.  
26:58 - Let's give them a color. Let's 
paint them all something gray.  
27:04 - So now you can see that they 
all belong together as a block.  
27:08 - For overtime hours, let's paint them 
a different color. Let's choose,  
27:11 - you can choose whatever color you like. But I'm 
going to choose some kind of a salmon color.  
27:18 - And now we're going on to calculate their pay.  
27:23 - This pay here really is the pay for January 1. So 
the week of January 1 is what they got paid here.  
27:31 - Now I'm going to calculate the pay for every week. 
So let's insert about how many three more columns.  
27:44 - And let's do once again equals 
the previous date plus seven.  
27:52 - And then fill that formula to the right. 
Looks like we need one more column.  
27:59 - I'll fill this one to the right. Now, how do we 
calculate pay, we simply took two numbers from  
28:09 - their hours and the wage hours worked, which was 
41 times their wage, we're going to find something  
28:20 - new here. If we just simply copy and paste these 
formulas, we're going to get the wrong result.  
28:27 - I'll show you what happens in a minute. And a 
copy this formula, paste it for the next week.  
28:35 - Now why in the world is everyone 
making over $1,000 some up to 3300.  
28:41 - What happened? Well, let's double click on 
this cell and find out where it's coming from.  
28:49 - First of all, you notice is very difficult 
to see the other side of the world here,  
28:53 - we can actually zoom out on our spreadsheet.  
28:57 - And we can make it easier to see the 
whole page. So let's zoom out to 50%.  
29:05 - We can see the whole spreadsheet now 
but the numbers are a little small.  
29:10 - Let's choose something else. I'm going 
to select the part that I'm interested in  
29:15 - just the cells. Click on zoom and choose fit 
selection that will fit this highlighted area  
29:23 - on the screen. So now I can see hourly 
wage all the way to the last formula. Okay,  
29:29 - now let's go look in this cell here. What's going 
on in cell number Oh, four. It says take the  
29:38 - cells D four and multiply by E four and give me 
the results D four and e4. Remember great while  
29:45 - we were in the previous week, we were taking the 
hourly wage times the number of hours. Well now  
29:50 - the relative referencing is saying well let's take 
the first two cells and multiply them together.  
29:57 - So we need to make a modification This actually 
should be referencing c four, and pressing escape  
30:06 - on the keyboard. And I'm going to delete all 
of this here, I'm going to right click on these  
30:13 - and choose clear contents. What I need is what's 
called absolute cell referencing. So I'm going to  
30:20 - modify my original formula here. It's telling me 
in this formula, that we should use C four times  
30:28 - d four. And I know that I'm going to copy it to 
the right four times. Well, what I really want  
30:34 - to do is keep referencing the hourly wage, 
because that's how you calculate pay hourly  
30:39 - wage. In C four times the number of hours worked, 
which is going to be D, E, and F and G and H. So  
30:48 - is there a way to tell Excel not to use relative 
referencing instead absolute referencing, that's  
30:55 - what we're going to call it anyway, I'm going to 
go up to this formula bar and modify the letter C,  
31:02 - I'm going to simply type in $1 sign in front of 
it, that doesn't mean a value dollars, it just  
31:07 - means that every time that you think about sales, 
C, or C four, you're going to always use column C.  
31:15 - For the first week, nothing changes, all of 
the numbers should stay exactly the same.  
31:22 - But now when I copy this range of cells, 
and paste it into the next column,  
31:30 - let's take a look at what this reference 
is. I'm going to double click here,  
31:34 - you notice that it is still referencing cell 
C four. But now the other cell is relative  
31:42 - referencing says let's move to the right one 
every time. And so it's now multiplying the  
31:47 - hourly wage times the hours from January 8, or 
the 42. I'm pressing escape on the keyboard.  
31:55 - Now I'm going to highlight this whole range. This 
time, I'm going to instead of copy and paste,  
32:01 - I'm just going to use the fill right option, using 
the little square in the bottom right corner.  
32:07 - It feels right. And all of the wages 
are calculated, let's double click here.  
32:13 - You see it's using their proper range, it's number 
of hours. In this case, it's 30. But it's still  
32:18 - referencing c four. And so now their overtime, 
I'm sorry, their their regular pay work is all  
32:25 - calculated correctly. Well, let's give this range 
a separate color as well. This is our regular pay.  
32:33 - So I'm going to highlight this section here. 
Go back to home and choose a color from the  
32:40 - bucket. Let's see it's time I like green, green 
for pay. Let's move to the right a little bit.  
32:50 - Now we need to calculate 
their overtime for each week,  
32:54 - their overtime pay. Well, we've 
done that for the first week. But  
32:58 - we need to have some more weeks. So let's insert 
four new columns. Choose the insert command.  
33:07 - Let's put in a date for each of these 
columns. This one was January 1,  
33:12 - this one's going to equal the first cell 
plus seven and then fill it to the right.  
33:23 - And so we have all of the weeks for January.  
33:26 - Once more, this is going to be a problem. If we 
don't have absolute cell referencing right now.  
33:34 - The overtime pay is correct for the first week. If 
we fill this to the right, we're going to have a  
33:42 - problem, we're going to have numbers that are way 
too high, like this one. If I double click here,  
33:50 - you see it's referencing overtime hours. But 
way back at the beginning, it is referencing  
33:56 - not the wage that we're expecting. It's 
referencing cell D four, so we're going to  
34:02 - have to change this formula to use absolute 
cell referencing again. So I'm going to  
34:08 - clear these highlight and choose 
clear contents from the menu.  
34:14 - I'm going to double click on this formula. And 
instead of C four, I'm going to reference it  
34:20 - as dollar sign c four. And I'm going to copy 
this formula all the way through the block.  
34:27 - Here's another way to copy and paste through the 
entire block. I'm going to copy just one cell and  
34:33 - then highlight the entire place where I 
want to use this cell and choose Paste  
34:41 - and all of the formulas now show the 
overtime bonus formula for each week.  
34:50 - Okay, the last thing we should probably do is 
give this its own color. So let's use the overtime  
34:55 - pay as a color such as I don't know what Pick 
something red, something blue, how about blue,  
35:03 - blue is looking good. Now for the total, 
what in the world is a total gonna look like?  
35:11 - First of all, I need to zoom out 
a bit. Let's go to zoom to 50%  
35:22 - total wages. Well, the total wages right 
now is calculated using, it looks like  
35:31 - pay plus the overtime bonus looks 
great. Let's put in a date over this,  
35:38 - this is going to be January 1. And once more we 
need to calculate equals this cell plus seven.  
35:48 - And we're going to use a few more weeks of this. 
Now this time, we should be able to get away  
35:57 - with using relative cell referencing five, 
highlight this and I'm feeling to the right.  
36:07 - I'm going to double click on that cell titles 
so that they all adjust to the proper width.  
36:16 - Let's check this one out. If I double click 
on this cell, what's it adding together  
36:20 - looks like it's adding the pay from the first 
note from the second week, times the overtime  
36:26 - bonus for the second week. That's exactly what 
we want it let's see a try another one here,  
36:30 - I'm going to pick this one randomly chose one 
cell, it looks like it's heading the proper  
36:36 - cell. So in this case, we don't want absolute 
cell referencing the usual default settings for  
36:44 - relative referencing work just fine. Let's add one 
more color. And we'll call it a day. Let's go to  
36:53 - a darker gray. One more thing that you might 
want to do is use the formulas across the bottom.  
37:02 - I'm going to actually highlight this section 
here. Fill it all the way to the right.  
37:11 - We calculate the totals the maximums 
the minimums for every week.  
37:23 - One more thing you might want to add here is the 
total pay for all weeks. Let's say January pay.  
37:32 - And I'm going to put in this equals sum, formula 
equals sum, and then add up all four of these.  
37:44 - five of these with a closed parentheses. Let's 
zoom in a little bit so you can see better.  
37:55 - Double click again. So we're adding up 
all five weeks that were paid in January.  
38:01 - And then fill this down for everybody. You can 
see now who is the top pay earner in the company,  
38:12 - I'm going to copy this range, paste it 
over here. The maximum person is this one,  
38:21 - earn $8,000 this month that looks like this line 
right here. Second from the last employee, let's  
38:28 - scroll to the left and see who that is second 
to the last employee. The name is Trent man.  
38:36 - Now when you print, you're going to have a 
difficult time fitting all of this on one page.  
38:41 - Fortunately, Excel gives us a nice way to print 
all things on one sheet. Let's go to the File menu  
38:52 - and choose Print. Now down here, it says no 
scaling, we are actually using five different  
39:01 - sheets of paper to get everything printed. 
It's going to be very wasteful, don't do that.  
39:08 - First of all, we can turn the paper sideways. 
So let's change the orientation to landscape.  
39:13 - That helps a little bit now it's only four pages 
wide. It says scaling here. We can say this,  
39:20 - we can fit all of the columns on one page or 
fit all the sheets in one page. Let's try that.  
39:27 - Okay, it's very small. It seems to work though.  
39:32 - Let's save it and print it as this size. The next 
lesson we're going to do is called grade book.  
39:39 - And you can see that the grade book is not just a 
simple grade book, but we're going to show what's  
39:43 - called conditional formatting. That's what those 
little colored dots are. They're going to show  
39:47 - who are the top students in your class and who 
are the bottom. We're going to do percentiles,  
39:52 - as you can see on the right side. And so several 
things about a grade book and formatting data  
39:57 - that we haven't done before and you'll have a 
very Nice looking chart when you're finished.  
40:02 - What you see on the screen in front 
of you is a grade book for employees,  
40:06 - we're going to give them a series of 
tests for the company, a safety test,  
40:11 - a company philosophy tests, a financial skills 
test and a drug test. And then we will give them  
40:16 - employment based on their testing level. So 
let's assume these are all new employees.  
40:21 - And they are testing after their job interview. 
So this is the completed spreadsheet. Let's start  
40:26 - from scratch and build it one place at a time. 
So I'm going to file and choose New and a blank  
40:34 - workbook. Let's start by giving this a title and 
the first cell, let's call it grade book. And  
40:40 - we're going to keep people's names in here. 
So we'll put last name here and first name.  
40:51 - Now you can see that I've typed in the names 
of the employees that are used from my payroll  
40:55 - spreadsheet, you can just copy and paste these 
names in or if you'd like to re type different  
41:00 - names, you can, but we're going to use up to line 
number 20, for those that are going to be taking  
41:04 - the company test. Now you notice that I put the 
titles of each test in C one, D one, e one and f1.  
41:14 - The first test is called safety test. The next 
one is called the company philosophy test.  
41:19 - The third one is the financial skills test. 
And then finally, the drug test. Notice that  
41:24 - these words all run into each other. Let's do a 
format on these cells to make them fit better.  
41:31 - I'm highlighting all four cells. 
And up here on this button.  
41:35 - It's called orientation. I click it. And 
let's choose rotate text up. And now,  
41:42 - each of these cells is written vertically. 
So it allows us to make the columns narrower.  
41:52 - Now, how much is each test worth? Well, let's 
fit in here and B two, and let's put in here,  
41:59 - points possible. That'll show us what 
the maximum grade is for each of these.  
42:09 - Let's say the first one is worth 10. The next 
test is worth 20 points, the financial test is  
42:14 - worth 100. And the drug tests we're just going to 
have as a pass or fail. So it is worth one point.  
42:20 - Notice that I need to make the column E a 
little bit wider because 100 doesn't fit in  
42:26 - the square very well. Now, all we have to do next 
is starting with john Kern is invent a number, how  
42:33 - many points did john earn and so on? Now, you can 
see that I've entered numbers for every one of my  
42:38 - employees. So the maximum is 10. Nobody has more 
than 10 points do they owe Trent man got an 11.  
42:46 - But then over on this side where it says drug 
test, you notice that everybody has a one or  
42:50 - a zero. So there were two employees that got 
zeros, that means they failed their drug test.  
42:55 - Next, let's calculate the percent that 
they earned for each of these tests.  
43:00 - I want to take the titles and copy them. 
So I'm highlighting all four of these,  
43:05 - right click on one of them and choose 
Copy. And let's put them in the next  
43:09 - area over how about column H. We'll start with 
column H. Now what would be the formula for a test  
43:17 - and the percentages? Well, you would take 
the equals, and we'll take this number 10  
43:24 - and divide it by the points possible divided by 
10 and press enter. This turns out to be a one.  
43:31 - Actually I wanted to say 1%. So I'm going 
back to the ribbon and choosing the Home  
43:36 - tab. And you'll find in here the formatting 
for percentages. Here's a percent sign.  
43:43 - So on the safety test, john Kern earned 100%. Now 
I'd like to copy and paste this formula so that  
43:51 - all the percents are shown for this assignment. 
Let's just fill it down and see what happens.  
43:59 - Now there's a problem. This one says divide 
by zero error. This one says 80%. This  
44:04 - one's is 90 90%. And this one says 100%. It should 
say 90, so it's not working like we thought it  
44:12 - would. Let's double click on this 100% do you see 
what's being divided, it says take C seven and  
44:18 - divided by C five. Really what we want to do is 
take C seven the score that Wendy received and  
44:26 - divided by the points possible. And so 
this error is what's called a relative  
44:31 - referencing error. It's counting back two 
cells and dividing by two cells above it. We  
44:38 - need to use absolute referencing here to get the 
correct results. So I'm going to clear these and  
44:44 - try again going to right click and choose clear 
contents. What I really want is to take equals  
44:51 - the cell here of the points that john earned 
and divided by this number with an adjustment  
45:00 - I want to absolutely choose row number two every 
time. So I'm going to put $1 sign in front of two.  
45:09 - And so now when I fill down, it's going to always 
reference row two for all of these assignments.  
45:16 - And so Indeed, we get the correct answers, 
there is 110% listed here. That is correct,  
45:22 - because Trent earned in 11 points. Now, I should 
be able to just copy and paste these cells,  
45:30 - or use the fill command and calculate 
all of these numbers, immediately.  
45:37 - Notice the drug test is either 100% 
or 0%. And so now even though the  
45:43 - tests are all worth different points, 
we scored each of them with percentages.  
45:51 - Now, it would be nice to tell at a glance which 
of these students are which of these employees is  
45:56 - doing extremely well and which ones are failing. 
Let's highlight a set of test scores. Let's do the  
46:03 - first one here. And I'm going to do conditional 
formatting. Conditional Formatting will color the  
46:08 - cells according to the numbers that are inside. So 
on my ribbon, I look for conditional formatting.  
46:14 - And in this case, I'm choosing icon sets. 
This set here is like a set of traffic lights,  
46:20 - it's got red, yellow, and green, and then a black 
one. Automatically, it puts an icon based on  
46:28 - who's in the top set percentages and who's 
in the bottom. So you can see that the green  
46:34 - lights show up immediately, with the top test 
scores. There's a red light for somebody that's  
46:40 - failing, and then there's a black one for an 
absolute miserable score of five. Let's try  
46:46 - that with the next row. Let's highlight the next 
set. And we'll choose conditional formatting,  
46:52 - and icons and choose the traffic lights again, 
and make the box a little bit wider. So you can  
47:00 - see once again, that Karen is having difficulty 
she received a six on the company philosophy test.  
47:08 - You have to do these all individually, because 
each one of them has its own set of scores.  
47:16 - If you try to format them all at the same 
time, you'll get different results. Choose  
47:22 - the traffic lights, again, for our financial 
skills test, and see who sorts to the top.  
47:29 - This time you notice right away there's 
a black line, or a black.on blessing,  
47:34 - she's not so good at financial skills. And for the 
drug test. The last one, it will format it again.  
47:43 - Under icons and feel free to experiment with 
the others. There's color scales, and there's  
47:47 - data bars, interesting things you can see on 
each of them. We're just using icons for these.  
47:56 - And so now we have little traffic lights, 
showing us quickly who is doing well, you  
48:02 - can see there's four green lights for john, are 
some people that have mixed results in between.  
48:09 - Now let's also make a rule that we want 
to sort out people that receive less than  
48:13 - 50% on any test. So a quick way to find out who 
that is, would be to highlight all of the test  
48:20 - scores and their percentages. Let's go back to 
conditional formatting. Now here's a nice option,  
48:26 - the first one called highlight cell rules. 
Let's choose the one that says less than.  
48:33 - So in this in, we want to find out who is 
receiving less than and let's put in 50%.  
48:39 - So I can put point five in here. And then the 
options here are light red filled with a dark  
48:44 - red text, you can choose different options, but 
we'll just leave it as the first and click OK.  
48:49 - And right away, you can see that at a glance, 
there are some people that have problems,  
48:55 - less than 50%. For Karen, less than 50% on a 
drug test means you failed it you got zero,  
49:03 - less than 50% on financial. And so we have 
a few of these people that are problematic.  
49:10 - Now since I have a concern about who should be 
fired, I'd like to create a another line called  
49:16 - fire employee with a question mark. And then 
we're going to say should we fire them or not?  
49:23 - We're going to use a formula that asks this 
question. Are any of these scores less than 50%?  
49:30 - If so, then we should fire them, 
you should at least pass with 50%.  
49:35 - So the formula we're looking for is called the 
or formula. he typed the equal sign and type or,  
49:41 - or in a parentheses. This means that we're 
going to ask a series of logical questions is  
49:47 - some number less than another one? And if so, 
then we're going to return true. Watch this,  
49:53 - I'm going to say or is this score 
here the safety test. Less than 1.5  
50:02 - and I'll put a comma. And then I'll ask another 
question. Is I for less than 50%? Another comma?  
50:13 - Is this less than point five? And then finally, 
the question is, is, comma is this one,  
50:22 - less than point five. So I 
have four questions in a row,  
50:26 - all of them asked the same thing is this number 
less than point five. And if I press enter,  
50:32 - it says false. None of these scores are less 
than point five. However, when I fill down, you  
50:38 - will see that some of these scores are less than 
point five. Here's a true and a true and a true.  
50:45 - Once more, we can see from this side from this 
line, Who should we fire? Who should we dismiss?  
50:53 - Let's do a conditional formatting on this 
one. Let's go highlight the cells choose  
50:58 - conditional formatting. And this time, 
I'm going to ask the question is equal to  
51:04 - is this question equal to true, I can spell 
true correctly. and press Enter. And so now  
51:13 - all the ones that are true are highlighted 
in red. So we know who we should fire.  
51:21 - Lastly, let's put some numbers 
at the bottom of the chart.  
51:24 - Let's go down to here and use 
our famous for max min, average.  
51:33 - Let's just use three max min and average. So 
in this cell, we ask equals this is going to  
51:41 - be the maximum of the range that's above it. So 
maximum of all of these scores with a parentheses.  
51:51 - And let's do the same for minimum equals min, 
parentheses. And we'll ask about all of these  
51:59 - parentheses, what is the average score 
equals average, and then the cell range.  
52:13 - And then we can use the fill right? option, 
show what the averages is for each of these.  
52:23 - We're going to copy all these and put them 
on the other side, where the percentages are.  
52:36 - Now since these are percentages, it would 
make sense to format them with a percent sign.  
52:45 - Let's create a chart that shows all the graphs 
of each of these scores from the safety test. I'm  
52:53 - going to highlight safety tests. And now let's go 
to insert. And let's choose a chart. Here's called  
53:04 - a column chart, the column chart, we'll just 
click it, and we'll choose clustered columns.  
53:14 - Slide it over to the side. Now we're missing 
some things on it, we need a chart title,  
53:20 - double click where it says title, we 
can change it to call it safety tests.  
53:29 - We also need to know who are the people taking 
the test, we just have numbers at the bottom.  
53:35 - So it'd be nice to change that. After we have 
the graph on the screen, it would be nice to show  
53:39 - the actual names of the people as well as the 
numbers. Or instead of the numbers right here,  
53:45 - we just have employee numbers at the bottom. let's 
right click on the graph, and choose Select Data.  
53:52 - Now when it says here, horizontal axis labels, 
let's change that, edit that. Now it's asking us  
54:00 - what is the label range, it's asking us for 
a range of cells, we can either type it in  
54:05 - or we can just simply go over here and click on 
Kern and drag down to Underhill. You'll notice as  
54:13 - I do that, it's telling me that from sheet one, 
the range a four to a 20 is going to be used.  
54:20 - And click OK. And click OK again. And so now 
you see all the people's names at the bottom.  
54:28 - So we've created a test, graph the safety test.  
54:33 - Let's do another graph. Let's do the company 
philosophy tests. So highlight the scores. Go  
54:40 - up to the Insert button or the insert options. And 
let's choose another chart. Another column chart  
54:50 - and slide it down below this 
one. Let's give it a new title.  
54:57 - Let's call it the company philosophy tests.  
55:04 - Once more, we need to add these labels 
in so that they are in the names instead  
55:09 - of the numbers. So let's choose Select Data 
where it says axis labels, we'll edit that.  
55:18 - And we need to slide over to select the 
people's names. So from under Hill, up to Kern.  
55:27 - And okay. And Okay. Let's close this menu here. 
And you can see the company philosophy test.  
55:38 - One more graph, the financial skills 
test. Let's create that one. Same process,  
55:46 - insert the charts and choose a 
column chart. Give it a name.  
56:04 - And let's give the names at the 
bottom something instead of numbers.  
56:23 - And let's slide this one in 
place below the other two.  
56:40 - Okay, that brings us to the finish of this of 
this gradebook test. Let's save our document and  
56:45 - print it once more when you print. Be careful that 
you don't print on 1000s of pieces of paper that  
56:52 - says we're using six. So maybe I'm exaggerating. 
Let's change a few things. Let's orientate it,  
56:57 - so it's sideways. Let's see if we can fit this to 
one one page. Once you have one page listed here,  
57:14 - you can see all the graphs neatly arranged and 
your data on the left side, you're ready to print.  
57:21 - In this lesson called decision maker, we're going 
to create a scenario where you're supposed to pick  
57:27 - a job. And we're going to weigh different factors 
based on your opinion. So pay the amount of jobs  
57:33 - that are out there in the job market, how much 
you enjoy it, how reliable the job is to you and  
57:39 - various factors. And then based on your opinions, 
Excel will give you an answer on what career you  
57:45 - should choose. Welcome to excel assignment number 
five. This is a decision chart that we're going to  
57:51 - create using Microsoft Excel. Let's assume that 
you're going to choose a career based on several  
57:57 - factors, we're going to consider several jobs here 
on the column A, and several factors that would  
58:03 - lead you to decide to go into that field such 
as your pay in that job, the job market, which  
58:08 - would mean the likelihood that you'll be hired the 
enjoyment factor How well do you like this job,  
58:15 - your talents, how well are you at doing the 
job. And then finally, another factor might  
58:20 - be schooling, how much time is invested to get to 
this career. And so we'll create a chart that will  
58:26 - lead you to a decision that probably is one of 
the most important in your life is which career  
58:31 - Are you going to work at. So let's start from 
scratch, I'm going to choose a new workbook,  
58:36 - a blank one. And let's start by giving it a title. 
Let's call it career decisions. Now down here,  
58:47 - we're going to call this the job column. And you 
invent some jobs that you think you might do.  
58:53 - So I've placed a few jobs here in column A, 
from McDonald's manager to an NFL player.  
58:59 - Now let's have a large variety of types 
of things that you could possibly choose,  
59:03 - you might have different ones. Now let's 
put in the factors that would lead you to  
59:08 - decide on one of these, obviously, 
pay is an important factor.  
59:14 - I've placed other factors into the chart as well. 
Not only pay but job market, the enjoyment your  
59:20 - talents and your schooling that's required. So 
now, under the column pay, let's assume that  
59:27 - a five or some number large is the best that 
you can do in the career and a one is the worst.  
59:34 - So a McDonald's manager that's put him down 
at near the bottom and doctors probably doing  
59:39 - pretty well. Let's give him a for NFL it's as 
soon as the best it's a five engineers probably  
59:45 - pretty good as a three and a truck driver might 
be a three as well. And then for the others job  
59:51 - market. Likely you probably can get a job there. 
A doctor once you get your school you're probably  
59:57 - guaranteed a job. NFL Probably the worst of 
the factors because hardly anyone gets that  
60:03 - gets to that level. Engineers, they've got very 
good job prospects and truck drivers apparently  
60:09 - are doing well as well as well. How well would 
you enjoy doing the job, maybe McDonald's, not  
60:14 - so much, doctor if that's your passion. So make 
up some numbers based on your own preferences.  
60:24 - And so I filled in each of these categories 
based on what I think about each of the each  
60:29 - of the each of the factors. Now, it 
would be simple justice to sum up the  
60:36 - lines here. So I'm just going to put su 
m, and then add up all of these together.  
60:45 - And then we'll fill down to see 
what kind of results we get.  
60:50 - So this is telling me that number 19 is the 
highest, I should choose engineering to be my job.  
60:57 - However, there's more to the decision than just 
adding up all of these factors. This assumes that  
61:03 - every factor is equal, such as the amount of pay 
you get is just as likely to influence you as the  
61:10 - job market. Well, in fact, job market might 
be more important, it's nice to have a high  
61:16 - paying job. But if you can't get it, then 
maybe job factor is a more important decision  
61:20 - than you thought it was. Let's add some new 
columns. In between each of these categories.  
61:28 - We're going to insert a new columns. 
So I'm clicking on the title,  
61:32 - the letters at the top the column headers, 
and right clicking there and choosing insert.  
61:40 - What I want to do next is add what I would 
call an importance factor for each of  
61:44 - these categories. For instance, job market, I 
would put that as the highest of the factors,  
61:50 - if I can't find a job, then there's no sense in 
going into it, employment or enjoyment, I should  
61:55 - probably enjoy it, I'm going to give it as a for 
my talents. So I think I can learn whatever it  
62:00 - is. So I'm going to say that's not as important 
schooling, it's not important, I'm willing to  
62:05 - do as much school is I have to, and then pay 
I'm going to count that as a medium factor.  
62:12 - Now for each of these, let's take a formula to 
multiply the relative importance, so equals the  
62:19 - relative importance of this times the factor 
for each career. Now this is going to require  
62:28 - a absolute reference. So where it says dollar 
sign see for I'm going to put $1 sign in front  
62:35 - of the four, because I'm going to reference 
this number in the blue every single time  
62:40 - after I fill down. So filling down here 
shows now the importance of the NFL 15  
62:49 - is somewhat moderated now, it's got less of 
importance than maybe the job market would have.  
62:58 - So let's copy this section here. 
Let's paste it into the next area  
63:05 - and paste it into the next area. And continue on.  
63:15 - Now let's readjust this when I do the final 
tally, I just want to say equals and I'm going to  
63:23 - add up each of these factors. So I'm 
putting a plus sign between each cell.  
63:37 - And then I will fill down in the last 
row to give it a title and call it total.  
63:46 - So once more 65 shows up as the most important of 
the jobs at least according to my criteria, a 65.  
63:55 - One more final touch might be to color code each  
63:58 - of these areas so that they stand 
out distinctly one from another.  
64:06 - Now looking at the last the totals, let's do 
a conditional formatting on these numbers. So  
64:11 - highlighting the numbers, I'm going to choose 
the top 10% that'll show basically the first  
64:18 - highest ranked item. And so 65% 65 is the highest 
number in the list at shows which one comes out  
64:26 - on top. Engineering, by the way, is what the 
computer decision chart recommends for me.  
64:32 - Let's see what you have prints your work, put 
your name on it. And you have a decision now  
64:39 - of what your career will be. In this lesson 
called sales report, we're going to summarize  
64:44 - a large amount of data we're going to have lots of 
different sales items will calculate who the best  
64:50 - sales people are in our department and 
create this pie chart when we're done.  
64:55 - We're going to use some data from some sales 
figures to do data. work in Microsoft Excel.  
65:02 - What you see on the screen in front of 
you is a report from perhaps the company's  
65:07 - database. on sales for a store, you can see that 
there's a lot of columns and a lot of rules. So  
65:14 - you don't have to type all these things in, I'll 
provide you with the spreadsheets so that you can  
65:18 - just manipulate what's already there. So you can 
see each title is at the top and row number one,  
65:25 - there's a few blanks that we're going to 
use formulas for. And then let's scroll to  
65:29 - the bottom and you will see that has, I think 
it's 172. Lowe's opens a sales transaction. So  
65:38 - all the way to December here, you can see the 
sales of each item in our pool supply store. And a  
65:45 - little bit of data about each one. The store cost 
and column E is how much the item cost wholesale.  
65:52 - Sale Price is what we sold it for. And then we 
need to calculate a few items such as the profit,  
65:57 - the commission, and then we'll do some reports 
on each salesperson to find out who the best  
66:02 - salesperson is in our store. Well, let's do 
some of the formulas here that we will have  
66:09 - to encounter when we work with sales data. 
Over here in column L, I've put some notes  
66:15 - on the formulas that we're going to use and some 
of the techniques that you'll see in this lesson.  
66:19 - text to columns, which we'll use to split these 
names, you can see that there's a first and last  
66:24 - name and column I we want to split them into 
separate columns. The second function is the  
66:29 - if formula. You've seen that before. The next 
function is called the sum if, which means  
66:36 - you can pick certain areas or certain items to 
add together based on a criteria that you choose.  
66:43 - This is a database really more than a spreadsheet. 
And in databases, we do a lot of sorting,  
66:49 - and filtering, a new concept that you'll see 
as a pivot table, which will give you a summary  
66:55 - of like the number of sales that each employee 
makes. And then finally, we'll review charting  
67:00 - by making a pie chart. Let's start by making 
the title up here in row one more readable.  
67:07 - Right now they're all compacted together. So let's 
highlight these. And let's go to text wrapping.  
67:14 - text wrapping allows us to see 
each one of these in its full text.  
67:21 - So now you can see in column B, C, and each that 
there's more text that we didn't see before.  
67:29 - Let's start with the item called text 
to columns, what we would like to do  
67:33 - is to split these columns so that they have first 
name in one column and a last name in the other.  
67:39 - So to do that, we're going to need to insert 
a new column to give it some space. So right  
67:44 - click on column header j, and choose Insert. 
And so now we have a blank column to work with.  
67:51 - Let's go to column I. And we're going to the 
Data tab here, and then choosing text to columns.  
67:59 - What this will do, it will allow the computer 
to parse the data that's in column I,  
68:06 - there's two options if you use fixed width. That 
means the first column might have five characters,  
68:11 - or seven or whatever you want to choose. But in 
our case, we want to split it based on the space  
68:16 - that's between these names. So I'm going to choose 
delimited. When you select delimited, it says what  
68:22 - are your delimiters a delimiter is a divider. 
And so if you select any of these items here,  
68:28 - a tab, a semi colon a comma or space, it will 
automatically divide the words on what you choose  
68:36 - above. So I'm choosing space. And so a space 
character between the words gives us two columns.  
68:45 - Now let's change these headers now since 
they make more sense to say first name,  
68:50 - and then last name for each of the 
salespeople. And so we've added a column. Now,  
68:57 - the next item is to calculate how much profit 
was sold. For each of these items. For instance,  
69:04 - transaction 1001 was a pool cover. The product 
code is something in our inventory that we just  
69:11 - use is based on the maybe the manufacturer's code. 
But how much profit do you make if you sell the  
69:18 - item for $98 and it costs you $58 to buy it from 
your supplier. It's a simple formula to say equals  
69:26 - this square here, which is F to subtract E to 
and press Enter. And you can see that we made  
69:36 - $40.10. Now you might have to format that using 
the key right here under the home button to get  
69:44 - the dollar sign. Now how about commission? How 
much money are we going to give to Charlie Barnes  
69:52 - for selling this pool cover? Well, here's the 
rule above 10% commission for items less than $50  
69:59 - by If he sells an item that sells for more 
than $50, we'll give him 20% of the profits.  
70:06 - So let's go and make a formula using 
the if command equals, if my rule says,  
70:14 - if this sale price, I'll click here is greater 
than $50. Comma, then let's give him more than  
70:25 - more profit than the less. So the 
rule says give him 20% of the sales.  
70:32 - Let's make it 20% of the profits actually. 
So let's take the profit and multiply  
70:39 - shift an EIGHT and a decimal two, so that's 20%. 
But if it's less than or equal to 50, comma,  
70:49 - then let's take the profits and 
multiply by point one, or 10%.  
70:57 - So that's the rule that tells us the commission 
is based on the value of the item that was sold  
71:04 - per center. So the commission for this item is 
20%. It costs more than $50. So we give him 20%  
71:16 - of the profits of the store. So Charlie burns earn 
$8.02, which is 20% of the profit on this item.  
71:26 - Now, let's just highlight these two squares, and 
fill down so I'm going to grab the little corner  
71:32 - and drag down. That's a little bit hard to fill 
down when you have 172 rows. So here's another way  
71:39 - to fill down. I'm going to hold the shift key on 
my keyboard, after selecting the first two rows,  
71:49 - and then slide to the bottom of the spreadsheet. 
Now I'm going to hold the shift key keep holding  
71:54 - the Shift key and click at the last area, you 
notice that the whole zone or this whole region  
72:01 - is selected, I'm sliding back to the top and 
sliding back to the bottom. Now once I have  
72:08 - the region selected, where I want to fill these 
items, I'm going to look for an AI command called  
72:13 - fill down. If I click on home, way over on the 
right, you will see an item called fill. If I  
72:19 - click here, I have down right up and left is 
my options I want to fill down, I click here,  
72:27 - it automatically fills the entire range. So 
sometimes that's quicker than trying to fill  
72:32 - it down using this little item in the corner. 
So I'm going to click to unselect the range.  
72:40 - Now you can see in some items such as this  
72:44 - one gallon of muriatic acid, it costs the company 
or cost the customer $7. The profit for the store  
72:52 - was $3. And Doug Smith earned 10% on that sale, 
so less than $50 item, you get less commission.  
73:02 - scroll back to the top. Now the next item 
that we're going to look at is called sum  
73:09 - if some if allows you to add together a range 
of items based on a condition. Let me show you  
73:17 - something more specific. Let's go to the bottom. 
And you can see that I have a few formulas here,  
73:24 - three different sums, I want to do the sum of 
all items, the sum of all the items that are  
73:29 - valued more than $50. And the sum of items valued 
at $50 or less. So let's go to the cost here.  
73:39 - Column F, which is the profit or that 
that is the cost to the customer.  
73:44 - The easiest formula is just the sum formula. 
So I'm going to type equals sum. Now what's the  
73:51 - range, I'm going to type the range this time since 
the cells are so so many, we're going to type the  
73:57 - letter F and two, and a colon and then the word 
the letter F 172. And you can see on the screen,  
74:06 - that there's a blue rectangle surrounding the 
range, close the item with the parentheses and  
74:12 - press enter. So in this year, the store sales were 
$17,110. Now what my question is, is how many of  
74:22 - those items were valued at $50 or more? What is 
the sum of all those items? The new formula that  
74:28 - we use now is called sum if So type equals sum 
if and that let's take a look at what I can put  
74:35 - in here. It's called a range and a criteria. So 
the range is once again f two colon f 172. That  
74:44 - gives me this the range of all the sales and the 
price to the customer. Now a comma, the criteria,  
74:53 - I'm going to have to put a quotation mark and 
then are greater than 50. Another quotation Mark,  
75:01 - what that will do is it will sum only the 
items that are greater than 50. So press enter,  
75:08 - you can see that $16,088 is the sum of 
all items that are costing more than $50.  
75:15 - Well, let's use the same formula. But this time, 
let's choose any items that are valued at 50 or  
75:21 - less. So that is equals sum if the range will 
be the same f two colon, f 172, and a comma.  
75:32 - Now this time, I'm going to put in 
my rule as less than or equal to 50.  
75:41 - And quotation and a parentheses. So now I can 
see that the vast majority of my sales are for  
75:49 - items that are $50 or more, hopefully, these two 
items, these two cells add up to the entire sum.  
75:59 - Okay, let's scroll back to the top and see what 
other items we have to do. two items that you do  
76:04 - in most database work is with sorting, and 
filtering. So let's go see how that works.  
76:11 - Go to the Data tab. And right here you see sort 
and filter, sorting and filter exactly how you  
76:20 - would think it would work. Let's choose sorting 
first. What do we want to sort by, we can sort by  
76:28 - the first, we can sort by the last name of an 
employee. And click OK. And so now all the items  
76:38 - have been rearranged so that the last name is 
alphabetized. So all the Barnes items come up  
76:44 - first, and then Hernandez starts at row number 
35. So we've sorted by column j, basically,  
76:54 - you can resort again, and this time, choose 
a different item. Let's go back to sorting by  
77:04 - the sale location.  
77:08 - So if you're looking for all the items that 
are alphabetized, according to column K,  
77:12 - you sort by sale location. And so all the Arizona 
sales are first, then the letter C comes next  
77:19 - New Mexico. And then finally, the last items 
that show up on the list are Utah. So sorting,  
77:27 - let's see it one more time, I went to sort back 
to the transaction number, which was the original  
77:32 - way that the spreadsheet was sorted. So the last 
item, and the first item now are back in order.  
77:43 - The next item is filtering. If you want to 
filter some items to show only certain values,  
77:49 - use the Next button filter, what are we going to 
filter. soon as you click that button, all these  
77:55 - titles automatically have a little arrow next to 
them. So what happens if I choose one of them such  
78:02 - as sales location, I can unclick certain items. If 
I only want to show one state such as New Mexico,  
78:11 - I leave a checkmark there and click OK. And so 
now it looks like my spreadsheet is much shorter.  
78:18 - It's only one screen full. All the items have 
this in common they have n m in this column K.  
78:27 - However, don't be fooled, the other items are 
still there, they're just hidden. Look at the  
78:31 - row numbers, we start with to jump to eight 913 
18. So there's lots of rows that are hidden.  
78:39 - Just because we sorted or we filtered by the sales 
location. Let's go back and select all of them.  
78:46 - Click ok. Try filtering by other columns. Let's 
filter by, let's say by the first name. Let's see,  
78:55 - I only want to see Helen. I'm looking at her 
sales. And now I see just Helens results.  
79:04 - Yeah, remember, the other items are still 
there. We just want to hide them temporarily.  
79:08 - So that's filtering, sorting and filtering are 
useful when you're doing analysis on a bunch of  
79:13 - data like you have here. The next item that I 
would like to use is called the pivot tables.  
79:19 - Pivot Table is a way to summarize a large group 
of data. So I'm going to select just the data  
79:24 - that I'm going to work with here. I'm going to 
select from cell A, and highlight all the way  
79:30 - down to the other corner of my spreadsheet. 
So I'm holding my mouse button down, moving  
79:35 - all the way to the bottom to row number 172. It's 
important that I limit my my pivot table to only  
79:42 - this data I don't want to include the summary 
at the bottom, nor do I want to include anything  
79:46 - that's over on the right in column M. So after I 
have selected all items, I go to the Insert tab  
79:56 - and I'm choosing a pivot table. Pivot Table So 
up next says what columns are we going to use,  
80:04 - you can see the selection here is from a one 
to K 172. That's what I've just selected,  
80:11 - it's going to create a new worksheet. Up 
until now we've only used one worksheet,  
80:16 - it's always been called sheet one, as you 
can see at the bottom. But when I click OK,  
80:21 - you will see now I have a new sheet. This one 
says sheet three, yours probably says sheet two.  
80:28 - Now what are we going to put in a pivot table? 
First of all, in a pivot table, you think of what  
80:33 - you're going to add together or make a summary of? 
Well, all I care about now is the sales figures  
80:40 - for each of my salespeople. So I'm going to 
select last name, and the sale price of each item.  
80:47 - You notice that we have a little 
summary here, Barnes sold $6,000.  
80:55 - When I click those, the computer guessed what I 
wanted to do. It says I'm going to use the rows  
81:01 - of the last name and choose the sum of the sales 
item. There are other ways you can add these  
81:08 - together, you can count them, you can average 
them put the maximum. Most often, you use some,  
81:15 - you can experiment with other items, you can 
drag these around and get strange results.  
81:22 - You can do filtering. There's a lot to do with 
pivot tables. But for all our purposes today is  
81:28 - I want to leave this as the sum of the values and 
the row labels as the last name of each employee.  
81:35 - Let's format these as dollars 
figures because that's what they are.  
81:41 - And now you can see that the best salesperson in 
my store is Barnes. Smith comes in a close second,  
81:48 - Hernandez needs some help. To show this visually, 
we can highlight these numbers and create a chart.  
81:56 - Let's go to insert insert. And a pie chart would 
be an appropriate type of sales figure here. So  
82:03 - I like three dimensional pie charts. Let's 
put this next to the other. And you can see  
82:11 - the last name of each salesperson and 
the percentages of the total sales.  
82:19 - You might want to show some data on this graph as 
well. You can right click this and you can choose  
82:27 - Add Data Labels. So you can click here. And it 
will show the actual number of sales that each  
82:33 - employee earned. Adjust the colors and the 
formatting to your style. Now the last thing  
82:40 - we should do is print to worksheets. So let's put 
your name up here. And then print this page. When  
82:47 - you go to print, make sure that it fits on one 
sheet. So I choose Print. And you can see in the  
82:53 - preview that I have two pieces of paper here, it's 
not really necessary to have two. Let's make this  
83:01 - a horizontal landscape. And 
let's condense this to one page.  
83:11 - And click Print. In this lesson called card 
database, we're trying to get some more  
83:17 - advanced features of Excel, you can see that 
we have literally a database of lots of cars,  
83:23 - we're going to find out how many miles they each 
worked. We're going to do some formulas with text.  
83:28 - So we can combine two fields together and split 
them apart. And we're going to do some averages,  
83:34 - and create some charts as well. So let's get 
started with a car database. Welcome to excel  
83:39 - assignment number seven. This is a database of all 
the company cars that you own in your business.  
83:46 - This is a rather extensive spreadsheet. So we're 
going to split the lesson into three parts.  
83:50 - You can see the lesson contents on the screen. 
First of all we're going to use importing to  
83:55 - create a text file into a spreadsheet. The second 
is we'll introduce three new formulas left,  
84:00 - middle and right. We'll use v lookup 
formulas to create value out of a table.  
84:07 - We'll review the if formula. We'll use the 
concatenate formula to put cells together,  
84:12 - we'll work on a pivot table. And lastly, we'll 
import our documents into Microsoft Word.  
84:20 - Your company fleet manager might have a computer 
system that does tracking and he's asking you  
84:26 - to do some analysis now on the cars that are 
in your company. Usually when a person gives  
84:31 - you a database, you have a few options. You can 
modify it in a database programs such as access,  
84:38 - or perhaps what you're more familiar with is 
with Excel. And so we're going to use a database  
84:44 - aspect of how Excel works today. You'll see that 
they have the spreadsheet on the screen shows the  
84:49 - cars that we own in the company with some IDs 
some miles their cars and years and their makes  
84:55 - their numbers the principal driver and so we're 
going to do several steps. With database functions  
85:02 - using Excel. First of all, you won't get a 
spreadsheet. When you ask for inventories, usually  
85:08 - what you get is a text file. And so what I have on 
the desktop here is a spreadsheet in the form of a  
85:14 - text file. If I double click this, it looks ugly, 
you see that it is not in a spreadsheet format,  
85:23 - at least not yet. This is what you get from 
reports from sales data from your Amazon account,  
85:31 - or your insurance company or your bank. These 
formats are called text formats, they don't have  
85:38 - any, they don't have any spreadsheet, graphs, they 
don't have any colors. It's just straight text.  
85:45 - But Excel knows how to work with these very 
well, you notice all these commas here.  
85:50 - These are all separators, they show the different 
columns that will come in the spreadsheet. So  
85:56 - I'll show you how to work with this. Now I'm 
going to close this first and start Excel.  
86:03 - Now instead of starting by working with the 
file itself, we have to import it. So I'm  
86:10 - going to the word file. And I'm going to 
open a document. And I'm going to choose  
86:16 - this text file, I have to go find 
it first. So I click on computer.  
86:21 - And let's browse. And let's navigate to the 
desktop. That's where I have this file saved.  
86:30 - And it doesn't show up. Why not? Well, remember, 
the extension on a txt file is txt. And Excel is  
86:38 - just looking for spreadsheets right now. So I'm 
going to change the filter here to show all files  
86:43 - on the desktop. And then scroll through it again. 
And there it is. There's the car inventory. txt.  
86:51 - Now when I open it, it's going to ask me some 
questions. How do I handle this? What do I do?  
86:58 - Are these like, text files that are equal 
sized cells each? Or are they delimited?  
87:04 - Well, these are all separated by commas, as you 
can see in the preview. And so we're going to  
87:09 - stick with the delimited idea. Choose next. And 
how are they delimited? Is the next question.  
87:16 - Are they separated by tabs, semi colons, commas, 
spaces or something else? Well, these are all  
87:22 - separated by commas. And as soon as I click comma, 
you notice all these columns seem to line up  
87:29 - as they are intended. And so that looks like 
I'm on the right track. I'll click Finish.  
87:35 - And so now I have the start of my spreadsheet. 
Each comma creates a separate column in the  
87:41 - spreadsheet, let's take you through some steps 
here, we're going to have to follow this pretty  
87:45 - closely. There's no room for creativity on this 
assignment, just follow exactly how it's presented  
87:53 - here. First of all, let's change the columns so 
that the column headers so that they can show  
87:59 - the entire title. So we'll use text wrapping, the 
first thing I would like to do is introduce some  
88:03 - new formulas that are able to handle text, you 
can take pieces of a field and create new fields.  
88:10 - For instance, whoever invented this car ID for the 
company was trying to squeeze as much information  
88:17 - into the ID as possible. And so we used 
a code like fd for Ford 06 for the year,  
88:25 - m T, G, four Mustang. And 001 is the car 
number. That's not normally recommended to  
88:32 - try to squeeze data into a field like this, 
but that's what he's doing. So we need to  
88:38 - come up with a few ideas on how to separate 
these fields. Let's go to where it says make.  
88:45 - I want to take the first two 
letters off of each of these  
88:49 - data items. So the first two letters is 
going to be using a formula called left.  
88:56 - And if I chose if I choose that, you notice the 
options are. First of all choose text. Well,  
89:04 - I'm going to choose this as my text. And the 
next after this comma is the number of letters.  
89:11 - Well, in my database, it looks like the first two 
letters are the manufacturers names. So let's use  
89:20 - a close parentheses. And sure enough, you can see 
that it's just slicing off the first two letters  
89:26 - of the database. Well, let's fill 
this down and see what we have here.  
89:33 - All the way to the bottom, how 
many are there looks like 53.  
89:38 - And so you can see we have two letters for each 
of the make. Now what do those mean? Let's Let's  
89:45 - Okay, let's create a new formula. And we're going 
to put in column C. The manufacturers name I'd  
89:51 - like to put in just the word Ford. Or down here 
General Motors t y must stand for Toyota a Jo is  
89:59 - Honda car is Chrysler and ah y is Hyundai. We're 
going to introduce a new function here called  
90:08 - a lookup table. Let's take these items 
here, like CR and h, y and t, y, and h, o,  
90:15 - and GM, and f, d. These are all our manufacturers. 
And let's actually put the real name here.  
90:30 - Okay, you can see that I've created a small 
table that coordinates these abbreviations  
90:34 - with the full name. To make this work, though, 
I have to have these in alphabetical order.  
90:40 - So I'm going to highlight these, just 
these cells, not the whole table,  
90:44 - and sort them. So I look for the data command, 
and sort. It says, What do you want to sort by  
90:52 - I want to sort by the first column, and click 
OK. If you don't put them in alphabetical order,  
90:58 - this next process is not going to work. Now 
that I've got these charts here, I'm going to  
91:03 - look them up. I'm going to look up f d 
in the chart and put in the word Ford,  
91:09 - the computer function to do that is called 
equals v lookup. That means vertical lookup,  
91:16 - it's going to look through a table vertically, 
look up the words f d, or the letters f, d,  
91:23 - and then return the second column, which is Ford. 
So let's type in the whole command here lookup.  
91:31 - And let's follow all these options through First 
of all, the first item it's looking for is the  
91:37 - lookup value. So fd is the lookup value, put a 
comma. And then the next item says table array,  
91:45 - the table is the little set of data at the 
bottom, you're going to scroll down this table,  
91:54 - and then a comma. Then it says column index 
number. That means which column in this table  
92:05 - contains the real word that you're looking for 
not the abbreviation but the real word. So the  
92:11 - second column contains Chrysler, Ford General 
Motors. So I'm going to type a two up here  
92:18 - and a comma, and then actually, this is the 
only option that we need, we can close the  
92:23 - parentheses Now press Enter, and scroll to the top 
notice it says forward. Looks like it's working.  
92:30 - Be careful, there's still one error with 
this. But we'll discover that in a moment.  
92:35 - If I fill this down, you're going to notice 
there's a relative reference error problem.  
92:42 - everything stops working after the third row.  
92:48 - It has this na, which means not available or 
not accessible. And so what's going on? Well,  
92:54 - if I double click on the second item, you'll see 
that this table is looking at rows 57 through 62.  
93:03 - And you notice down here that 
it's been shifted down one,  
93:07 - that should send an alert to your mind to say, 
Oh, the computer is using relative references  
93:13 - instead of absolute references. So if I 
go back to Ford, and double click this,  
93:19 - I'm going to modify this. So I'm going to put in 
$1 sign in front of 56 and $1 sign in front of 61.  
93:27 - So that means that it's always going to use those 
row numbers, every time I look up a value. And  
93:34 - now it looks like it's creating the results I 
want. So let's go all the way to the bottom.  
93:41 - And you see that we've created a new field in 
our database that shows the manufacturer's name.  
93:48 - Now the model is the second item. While the model 
is found here, this is the the letters empty G.  
93:56 - So we can just use the left command like we did 
for the manufacturer. So we're going to use a new  
94:02 - item called mid command. So in this case, we have 
an a Ford Mustang, empty g stands for Mustang.  
94:11 - So let's, let's pull out some letters. Well, to 
pull out the manufacturers make we use the first  
94:18 - two letters and so we use the left command. 
Well, we want to pull something out of the  
94:22 - middle of the text. So this one is called the mid 
command and my D. It says here that it's going to  
94:29 - return the characters from the middle of a text 
string, given a starting position and the length.  
94:35 - So let's put a parentheses. The first item that 
it's looking for is the text. So we'll click here.  
94:44 - And then a comma, the start number where 
does this m start? That's it position 12345.  
94:50 - So it starts at position five and the string and 
then a comma. How many characters do we need?  
94:57 - Well, these all have three characters in each The 
model numbers. Okay, close parentheses and Enter.  
95:05 - And now we see MTG. So let's fill these down 
a ways and you can see that it's pulling out  
95:11 - other items. FCS must stand for Ford Focus, 
and then a gender General Motors si MRSLV.  
95:25 - Let's see what some of these others are. Scrolling 
all the way to the bottom and filling down,  
95:33 - you can see that we have some of these others. Now 
the meaning of all these models can be interpreted  
95:38 - as follows mt G is for Mustang. FSC is for 
focus. CMR is a Camaro SLV is a Silverado,  
95:49 - Toyota Camry and a Toyota Corolla are next. 
And let's see a civic looks like a Honda Civic,  
95:57 - Honda Odyssey. And what's next here, 
a PT Cruiser, Christ's their caravan,  
96:04 - and then the Honda Elantra. So these are 
all different models. So at the bottom here,  
96:09 - we were going to do the exact same process of 
creating a lookup table. So I'm going to copy down  
96:15 - all of these manufacturer model names, 
and then put the real name next to them.  
96:22 - Okay, I'm finished with typing in all of these car 
models and their full name. Remember, a V lookup  
96:30 - table only works if it's alphabetized. So I'm 
going to highlight these squares, choose sort,  
96:37 - and sort by the first column, which is D. 
Click OK. And so now the this line is in  
96:44 - alphabetical order. Once we have that done, 
we can create a lookup value. So I'm going to  
96:51 - use the exact same lookup as my model. I'm 
going to copy this and paste it over here.  
97:01 - It doesn't seem to be working right? 
It says, A lantra is the first item.  
97:07 - What's going on, I'll double click here to 
find out. We're looking for D 56 through e 61.  
97:15 - Now that's almost there. The only problem 
is, this table is longer. So I'm going to  
97:21 - extend this one all the way to the bottom, 
and press enter and go back to the top.  
97:27 - Now it looks like it's finding Mustang correctly. 
Since the other one was created with the  
97:33 - absolute references, we have the dollar signs 
in the in the top, it seems to be working right,  
97:39 - so we'll fill down and we'll have the 
model name for each of these cars.  
97:47 - Almost there. Let's open this a little light 
wider. We have an error down here what's going on.  
97:55 - This one says not accessible or not available. 
What's wrong with this, we have a 00 D,  
98:03 - somebody in their stupidity, typed in a zero 
instead of an O back at the beginning here.  
98:11 - So let's fix that. Up here at the top, 
we have the NA h o and then the year  
98:19 - we have an extra zero in there. So let's delete 
that zero and press Enter. And now it appears that  
98:26 - that typo was fixed. So when you get text from 
another company, sometimes you have to realize  
98:33 - that people didn't enter the data correctly. 
Lastly, let's put in the manufacturer year.  
98:40 - This is going to use the mid command again, we're 
going to pull out the year from this square.  
98:50 - But a comma, it's going to start at position 
three. And we're going to take two text items,  
98:56 - two letters, and we get 06. That one seems 
a little simpler. So we'll scroll that down.  
99:03 - And now we'll pull out just the year, a 
two digit year for each of these cars.  
99:11 - Now we need a formula to calculate the age. How 
old is our car? Well, let's put in an equal sign.  
99:21 - What would you do? Given that I'm creating this 
spreadsheet in the year 2014. I'm just going to  
99:29 - take 14 and subtract the years that come 
before and press Enter. And it says eight.  
99:37 - So a 2006 car is eight years old. seems to 
work. Let's see what happens when I feel down.  
99:47 - Most of the time it works except for here. 
What's this says there's a problem with it.  
99:53 - Now if you look closely at this, this is an 
O six. It's literally an O six. We want 06.  
100:00 - So once more, somebody thought that it was an O 
six, and in the database, they put a o letter O  
100:07 - in here. So let's delete that Oh, and put 
in a zero. And so that fixes that value.  
100:14 - The same happened here. Let's go back to this row 
15. I'm deleting the Oh, and I'm re typing a zero.  
100:24 - Let's continue to fill down and see 
what other errors might show up.  
100:31 - Oops, there's another one another value that 
says it cannot be read. So let's go to here.  
100:39 - Ah, oh, and then a 05. So we've had 
to do some corrections to our data.  
100:49 - Now, this formula is very simple. It's actually 
too simple. This car is negative 84 years old.  
100:58 - Where did that come from? Well, that was called 
the y2k bug where computers just held two digits  
101:05 - for every year, it worked until we switched 
over to the year 2000. So a 98 is actually  
101:13 - 16 years old. And it gives us a negative 84. 
That's because it's taking the formula 14  
101:21 - minus the value in cell B nine f 19. Well, it's 
a correct number according to the computer,  
101:29 - but it doesn't serve our purposes, we want to 
make sure that the number comes out correctly.  
101:34 - So let's readjust our formula. Let's erase 
this one. And I'm going to ask a question,  
101:40 - if if the difference between 14 
minus this gets less than zero,  
101:52 - then I want a formula for all those 90s and 
80s. Cars. Well, I just simply say I'll take 100  
102:02 - minus the year. And that'll get us the distance 
between 98 to 2000, that would be about two.  
102:10 - And then I'm going to add 14 to get to our 
current value. Otherwise, we'll just use  
102:17 - the previous formula, we'll say 14 minus this 
here. And so now we have two different cases,  
102:25 - for those that are less than 2000. And those 
that are greater than 2000. If I press enter,  
102:31 - I still get the same results for the first. And 
let's scroll to the bottom and see what happens.  
102:38 - And so sometimes, a simple calculation needs to 
have a few cases. So yeah, this is correct. Now,  
102:45 - a 1999 car in the year 2014 is 15 years 
old. So the formula seems to work.  
102:54 - Now let's go over to this formula, miles per year.  
102:58 - Well, that should be pretty simple. least at first 
glance, we want to say this equals the total miles  
103:05 - divided by the years driven, which is the age 
of the car. And so that shows 55,000 miles.  
103:15 - Let's fill this down. And let's see if it works. 
Almost all of them work. There's a few errors.  
103:26 - There's an error, it says divide by zero. 
Why in the world are we getting that error?  
103:31 - That's because over here in the age, it says 
this car is zero years old. It was made in  
103:37 - 2014. Is it really zero years old? Well, it's 
less than a year old. But it's not zero. So it's  
103:46 - probably six months old, maybe three months old. 
Let's make a slight adjustment to our formula.  
103:53 - If I double click on this formula, you'll see 
that I'm dividing eight, the age divided by  
104:00 - the miles. Well, the age and some of these 
was zero, we can't really divide by zero.  
104:07 - And this car really is not exactly eight years 
old, it might be eight years and six months,  
104:12 - because a car that is zero years old really 
has a few months already on it. So let's just  
104:17 - round a little bit. Let's add a little bit 
of a of a number. Well, let's see, we want  
104:23 - to add something to G two. So I'm going to have 
to put a parentheses before g two and add point  
104:32 - five let's add let's add a decimal point five. So 
that that year is really a year and six months.  
104:41 - Why parentheses? Well, you should know from 
your order of operations in your algebra class  
104:46 - that you're supposed to add and subtract after 
you divide and multiply. And so we want to make  
104:52 - sure that we add first and then divide. 
So that's why the parentheses are there.  
104:58 - If I press Enter And then fill this formula down,  
105:06 - we should get better results. So the mileage 
calculation is based on the age plus six months.  
105:14 - And we have no divide by zero errors. Let's format 
these two columns, they could probably use some  
105:22 - commas to make them look more like miles, it's 
easier to see when you have 1000s. If you have  
105:28 - a comma in there, let's move, let's keep moving. 
The color of this is black, and white, green, etc.  
105:35 - That's fine. We'll use that in a few minutes. When 
we get to the new car ID. The principal driver  
105:41 - shows the last name of each employee. How many 
warranty miles are there on this car? This is a  
105:48 - 50,000 mile warranty. And this car is just barely 
under the warranty, it still has 10,000 to go.  
105:55 - Well, the question is, is this covered under 
warranty, that's the formula we're going to  
105:59 - do next. And so we'll do an IF calculation. 
If if the miles are less than or equal to  
106:11 - the warranty, and yes, it is covered. And so 
I'm just going to put the letter Y for covered  
106:17 - a comma. So if it's not covered, I'm going to 
write the word not covered. And then a quotation  
106:23 - and a parentheses. So now this says 
yes, it is covered, I get a why.  
106:30 - If I fill down, I will see a different 
value for each of these cars.  
106:35 - And some are covered and some are not covered 
under the warranty. The last item that we're  
106:40 - going to fill in here is called the new car 
ID, your boss gives you this requirement.  
106:47 - He says take the original ID. And I want you 
to squeeze in three more letters in between the  
106:53 - manufacturer and this last three digit number. And 
I want to I want to know what color is the car.  
107:00 - So once more, this is a bad idea to try to squeeze 
as much information into one field. But your boss  
107:06 - said so. So it's the truth. Let's do it. How do 
we how do we how do we combine fields, the formula  
107:14 - you're looking for is called concatenate co n. And 
then you'll see concatenate shows up here. I click  
107:22 - it, double click the format that you're supposed 
to fill in is simply says text one, text two, etc.  
107:31 - So we're going to concatenate a bunch of fields, 
we want to put first of all continue using f d,  
107:38 - comma, and then we want to have the 
manufacturers year comes, as you can see,  
107:43 - that comes second in the list. And then 
we want to continue on with the model.  
107:51 - And then a comma, and now your boss said put 
in the colors. So we want to put in black,  
107:59 - we're going to adjust that because 
he only wants the first three letters  
108:03 - of the word. So we're going to delete this 
two squares, I want to know just the left  
108:12 - three letters of black. So I left left 
three of j two, so j two comma three,  
108:21 - and a close parentheses and a comma. So we've 
just added the left three letters of black.  
108:28 - And now what we need is the last three 
from here. So we use the formula right  
108:38 - click here, comma, three, double close parentheses 
and press enter. So now we have the new car ID.  
108:49 - One more change that we need to make 
is that this shows lowercase letters.  
108:56 - Your boss didn't tell you but he forgot to say 
all IDs in cars have uppercase letters only.  
109:04 - Now there's a nice formula to put 
in there. If I want to isolate these  
109:11 - letters and change them to uppercase, the 
formula they're looking for is called upper.  
109:18 - So I put a parentheses around the part that I 
want to be uppercase and press Enter. And now  
109:26 - the new car ID shows bl a as black. I'm 
filling down and now we have a new car ID.  
109:41 - Okay, so those are a lot of different database 
functions that you can use to manipulate text.  
109:46 - The next item in our checklist of things 
that we're going to see on this assignment  
109:50 - is called a pivot table. a pivot table 
allows you to summarize data. For instance,  
109:57 - your boss might ask of these drivers 
Who has the greatest amount of miles.  
110:04 - There's some formulas you could 
work with. But here is one of them.  
110:08 - It's called a pivot table, I'm going to insert, 
and under the insert command, you see pivot table.  
110:15 - It says, What's my range that I'm going to 
work with, and it automatically selects the  
110:19 - entire spreadsheet. Click ok. a pivot table 
creates a new sheet down here, you notice this  
110:28 - one said car inventory. And this sheet is called 
sheet one, I'm going to select the driver first.  
110:38 - put a checkmark next to him. And then I want to 
know about the miles on the car. So I click on  
110:44 - miles, automatically, the computer assumes that I 
want the sum of the miles and the driver. And so  
110:51 - now we have a chart that shows each driver 
in the number of miles that he created.  
110:57 - Well, you could also put in a chart 
and create a list of all the drivers  
111:05 - and their miles. And so Smith jumps 
out right away from our graph.  
111:10 - Whoever Smith is he's driving a lot. Let's go back 
to our car inventory and see what Smith is up to  
111:18 - Smith, what kind of car does he have, oh, here's 
a Ford Mustang. No wonder he's driving so much,  
111:23 - I would drive a lot to have somebody gave 
me a Mustang. And so Smith shows his miles  
111:29 - as the most of anyone in this series. Another 
type of graph that we haven't worked with yet  
111:34 - is called a scatter chart. A scatter chart 
allows you to put a specific data points  
111:41 - on a graph. So I'm going to select here, the age 
of the car, and the miles, just these two columns,  
111:49 - I'll click on their column headers, and select the 
entire column. I'm going to insert a new chart.  
111:57 - And the chart that I'm looking for here has a 
bunch of points on it. It's called a scatter  
112:00 - chart. And as soon as you select it, you can 
see what it's doing. It's pointing each of these  
112:06 - graphs, each one of these dots on the graph shows 
that the years across the bottom are showing from  
112:14 - zero years up to looks like about 18 is the oldest 
car and then the number of miles each car has.  
112:23 - So it almost looks like a straight line. 
Well, there is something called a trend line  
112:30 - that we're looking for. So I'm clicking on the 
plus sign up here. And I'm selecting trend line.  
112:37 - And now there's a dotted line that goes up 
and down through the middle of these dots,  
112:43 - we could probably make these access titles 
a little bit easier to read. So I'm going  
112:48 - to select those as well. deleting the word access 
title and putting in the word miles, miles driven.  
113:02 - And then down here on this axis, I'm 
changing this to the age of the car,  
113:08 - age of the car, and then in parentheses, 
years. And so let's Park this off to the side.  
113:17 - And slide over. So now we have a chart that shows 
the miles in our inventory. Some of these are  
113:23 - outliers. Some of these are right on the line. 
one more way that we could do some analysis is  
113:33 - we could find out which cars are being driven 
more than others. So let's select column I.  
113:41 - Let's go to conditional formatting. 
Let's try out something called the  
113:46 - color scales. It's pick one of these color 
scales, there's blue and green and red  
113:50 - doesn't matter which one you choose. But when 
you pick one, you will see that some colors are  
113:56 - highlighted in darker and lighter colors, they 
show you the extremes. So like this 35,000  
114:03 - shows up as one of the highest. Let's sort this 
spreadsheet based on the miles driven per year.  
114:12 - The first thing we have to do is select just the 
range where our data is stored. We're going to  
114:17 - ignore these lookup tables at the bottom. So 
I'm highlighting all the way down to row 53.  
114:25 - And then going to the Data tab and choosing sort. 
Let's sort by column. What column is this column I  
114:38 - and let's go from the largest to the smallest and 
click OK. And so you can see that this car here  
114:46 - this particular car has 35,000 miles per year. On 
average. It only has six months and the guy has  
114:54 - already driven at 17,000 miles. We scroll to the 
bottom you'll see that the minimum Drive driven  
115:00 - car is this Ford Mustang here, it's eight 
years old and it has 40,000 miles on it.  
115:06 - The last item I'd like to do is to create a 
report. So let's go back to Microsoft Word.  
115:14 - And we're going to copy and paste a few 
of these items from our spreadsheet,  
115:18 - the title of a report is 
going to have our name on it.  
115:25 - Next, I'm simply going to put the top 
drivers by miles. And then I'm going to  
115:29 - go back to excel. Go back to my sheet, copy 
this graph, so I'm going to right click it,  
115:37 - choose Copy. And you can see you can go back 
to word right click it and choose Paste.  
115:48 - And so these two programs integrate with each 
other. Press Enter a couple of times. And I'm  
115:54 - going to show the next is the scatter chart for 
the car inventory. So it says the scatter chart  
116:03 - for the car inventory miles on each car. Now 
I'm going back to excel. And I'm going to copy  
116:11 - this graph here that has the scatter chart. So 
right click on it, choose Copy, go back to word,  
116:20 - right click, and choose Paste. And so I have two 
charts that came from my graph. let's print these  
116:30 - and call that our final assignment. One more 
thing when you go to save a document that in  
116:36 - Excel that was created using a txt file, you 
can see up here it says car inventory. txt.  
116:43 - When you go to save that, you're 
going to get an error message.  
116:46 - It says you're still in the tab formatted 
text. Do you want to keep using that format,  
116:53 - you should say no, we want to save this 
using a new format. Instead of tab delimited,  
117:00 - or text delimited, we're just going to choose 
Excel workbook. And now all those pretty blue  
117:08 - and all the formula and all the other things 
that were created in the charts, they will  
117:12 - stay with your spreadsheet, a regular tab or text 
delimited file cannot possibly save these items.  
117:22 - Okay, in Microsoft Word. Let's go File and print. 
And we'll call our document done. In this section,  
117:30 - we're going to talk about problem solving. And 
so you can see that Susan in front of us has  
117:34 - a problem. She wants to take a vacation and 
wants to spend as little amount as possible.  
117:40 - And so our options are to go on a 
Caribbean cruise, go to Orlando,  
117:44 - or go to Chicago. Each one of these requires 
flights, car rentals, and hotels admission fees.  
117:50 - And so Excel is a great tool to figure out 
which one of these would be the least expensive.  
117:56 - And so I will give you a partial solution. 
But that by this point in the course though,  
118:01 - you're supposed to be able to solve some of 
these problems on your own. And so it will  
118:06 - stretch your thinking and reinforce the skills 
that you've learned before. So problem solving  
118:11 - is going to start with a simple problem. And then 
gradually, I'll give you several until you get to  
118:16 - the most complex problem. When you reach the end, 
you will be considered a person that can use Excel  
118:23 - to solve real problems in your personal life 
and in your job as well. Hi, in this video,  
118:30 - I'm going to show you how to calculate 
interest on a simple interest payment plan  
118:34 - for four loans with different interest rates and 
then make a graph. So here's the final product  
118:39 - that we're going to arrive at at the end of this 
video. And so you'll see that we have a $10,000  
118:44 - loan with four different interest rates. And then 
we have monthly payments at the right column.  
118:50 - Let's start up a new spreadsheet. And then 
we're going to put in the data labels.  
118:54 - So the first thing I'm going to do is fill out 
the column titles for our loan. So the first  
118:59 - column is principal, the interest rate, the months 
that we have to pay over the total interest paid  
119:05 - the number of dollars that the total loan 
will be and then the monthly payments.  
119:11 - In the first column, let's put in labels here for 
loan A, B, C and D. I'd like to make sure that  
119:17 - these column headers are correct. So let's double 
click on the little line that's between each of  
119:21 - these dividers. And that will separate the column 
to be exactly the right width for the label.  
119:28 - So let's zoom in and let's check out what our 
payments will be. So let's make up a principal  
119:33 - number for our loan. Let's say we're buying a car 
and I'm going to spend $10,000 that I don't have.  
119:39 - So I enter in 10,000. And you can see that the 
numbers don't quite fit now. So let's expand the  
119:45 - column a little bit. And if you don't have dollar 
signs, you can go up to the accounting area and  
119:50 - you can change this to $1 sign if you want. Now 
the interest rate if I put in a number here,  
119:56 - let's say 9% and I use the percent sign 
It will calculate the number correctly.  
120:02 - However, if you don't put in there 9%, you can put 
in 0.09, which is the decimal equivalent of 9%.  
120:09 - And then if you choose the percent 
sign, it will show it correctly.  
120:13 - Now the number of months, let's say I have 
a 12 month loan, and so I put in a 12.  
120:18 - So these three columns here are 
going to be numbers that we enter,  
120:22 - and then the last three columns are going to 
be the formulas that help us solve our problem.  
120:27 - So let's start with the formula interest paid. 
So that's a formula where we type in equals,  
120:32 - we want to take the principal, which is B two, 
and I will multiply by C two, which is the rate.  
120:40 - So you can either type in equals b two, 
and use the star key, which is the shift  
120:45 - eight. And that's for multiply. And then finally, 
type in z two, C two, and press Enter. And that  
120:51 - will tell us that the total amount of interest is 
$900, over the price of the loan. So then the next  
120:58 - column is the number of dollars paid total. So we 
have to pay back our money. Let's go with equals,  
121:04 - and we'll click the 10,000, then we put in a plus 
sign, because we have to add the number of dollars  
121:10 - interests that we're going to pay as well. And 
so that's 900, and press enter. So the total  
121:16 - cost of your car will be $10,900. Now you're 
going to pay this over the life of the loan,  
121:23 - so we're going to take this total amount and 
divide it by 12. So we'll take divide by the  
121:30 - number of months that we just agreed to pay. So 
that's f two, divided by E two, and press enter.  
121:37 - So your monthly payment for this car is $908. Now 
you can adjust this quite easily if you want to  
121:43 - change something. So let's click in here and let's 
say I have a $20,000 loan for my car. And you can  
121:48 - see the payment automatically is recalculated. Now 
you're shopping between different banks, and you  
121:54 - want to see what the competitive rates are. So 
let's take our 20,000. And I'm going to select  
122:00 - and fill down. So let's see I'm selecting this 
whole bracket of looks like 12 different cells,  
122:07 - I'm using the Ctrl key and D on the 
keyboard. And that is for fill down.  
122:13 - Now I want to calculate on different rates. So 
one bank here decided to give me an 8% loan.  
122:19 - Another one is seven and even 6%. So I shopped 
around, and I found four different rates.  
122:25 - Now the number of dollars that I pay is equal 
and the number of months that I pay is equal.  
122:30 - Now let's take the last three columns, and we're 
going to fill down so I'm going to select those  
122:36 - three columns, and drag from the small dots in 
the corner. And this will calculate my interest  
122:45 - based on the 12 month payment. So let's see 
here, the interest rate is better for the 6%.  
122:53 - And then the total monthly payment is slightly 
lower. Now I'd like to visually present this. So  
122:58 - let's select the total monthly payment, and we'll 
make a bar chart out of it. So let's see. Let's go  
123:04 - to the Insert tab here. And I'm going to select a 
chart for bar chart. Let's choose this first one.  
123:12 - Now there's my chart. And let's 
see, I'll zoom out slightly.  
123:17 - Let's put in a chart title. And I'm going to 
call this monthly payments for $10,000. All right  
123:28 - now at the bottom, you can see that I have these 
1234. I would like to compare the interest rates,  
123:34 - that's the only thing that changes in here is 
the 9876. So let's do a right click on the chart  
123:39 - here and choose Select Data. In the column here 
where it says axis labels. I'm going to edit this  
123:46 - and it says please give me a range. So I can 
just simply select from the chart, here's 876789.  
123:54 - And then it puts in the correct columns are c two 
to C five. And that is exactly what I'm looking  
124:00 - for. Click OK. And then it says here, this is what 
I'm going to display now, which is 987 6%. And  
124:06 - click OK. And there you got your chart. My name 
is shed Sluiter, and my youtube channel is called  
124:13 - tech Made Simple. I'm a university professor that 
teaches programming, computer software development  
124:19 - and security, all kinds of technology, including 
what you just saw here with Microsoft Excel.  
124:25 - Welcome to excel problem solvers. This is 
a set of examples of how you can use Excel  
124:31 - in solving real world problems, problems that are 
too complex to solve with a regular calculator, or  
124:38 - to solve in your head. So we're going to look at 
Susan and Tim. Every time we get a new page in  
124:44 - this booklet, we're going to see that they have a 
different task. And so here's what we're going to  
124:49 - do for each page. First of all, we'll listen to 
Tim and Susan and tell us about their problem.  
124:54 - We'll build a spreadsheet with proper formulas. 
Now I'm going to show you a partial solution. For  
125:00 - each of these solutions, we're going to create 
a spreadsheet with a little bit of a design.  
125:05 - But I'm going to assume that you've already done 
some Excel work and so that you can finish this  
125:10 - with a little bit of collaboration with 
your friends and a little bit of thought.  
125:13 - And then finally, every one of these solutions 
will have a graph, it'll be a bar chart that  
125:17 - will show a comparison. So let's see what these 
different problems are. The first problem we're  
125:23 - going to look at is a school shopping list. And 
so Susan has a lot of things to buy. And she has  
125:29 - three different stores to shop that Tim also 
has a shopping list that's slightly different.  
125:35 - The second problem we'll face is, should we buy a 
cat or dog. And so we'll look at all the different  
125:40 - costs associated with buying each of those. The 
next problem that Susan faces that she wants to  
125:46 - take a vacation. And so we're going to give three 
different options either a Caribbean cruise,  
125:52 - Orlando or Chicago, Tim's going to do the same 
vacation, but he has a different number of people.  
125:57 - The next problem is that they're going to purchase 
printers. And so there's three different kinds of  
126:01 - printers to choose from. And the cost of ink 
for each is different. Number five is more  
126:06 - complicated yet, we're going to untangle the cell 
phone bill. Number six is we're going to choose  
126:11 - from three different cars, a very economical 
car and a luxury. In this first Excel problem,  
126:18 - we're going to go on a shopping trip. And 
so we have a shopping list. Susan says,  
126:24 - I'm Susan, would you help me pick one of 
these three stores to buy my school supplies.  
126:29 - Here's my shopping list. And so to the right of 
the shopping list, you can see all the items that  
126:34 - Susan would like to buy. Her choices are Walmart, 
dollar trap, and office repo. Each price is listed  
126:44 - below. And then her number of items that she 
would like to buy are listed on her shopping list.  
126:51 - So for instance, three ballpoint pens. at Walmart, 
it's going to cost two or three times 50 cents,  
126:59 - or $1.50. Now this is a large complicated shopping 
list with many items. So this is a perfect way to  
127:06 - solve a problem using an Excel spreadsheet. Inside 
the Excel spreadsheet that we're going to create,  
127:12 - we need to add a list of all of the items in 
the shopping list, and then a column for each  
127:18 - store. And so pause the video right now and 
type these in just as you see on the screen.  
127:28 - Next, let's go back to the shopping list. 
Each price listed at each store has to be  
127:33 - put into the spreadsheet, and then put 
them into this column under Walmart.  
127:39 - Pause this video until you 
have the numbers typed in.  
127:45 - Now you might say these look like dollars. 
So let's make $1 sign each of them. Open the  
127:51 - currency, add $1 sign. Let's add the prices 
for dollar trap and also for office repo.  
128:00 - So pause the video until you have all 
the prices listed for each of the stores.  
128:07 - Now I'm going to help you a little bit further 
with the problem, but not completely. Let's start  
128:12 - by looking at Susan's shopping list for each item 
for the ballpoint pen. We know how many she needs  
128:19 - such as three. And so I copy down 
the number of items that she needs.  
128:25 - Now, how would you figure out the amount of 
money that she would spend on ballpoint pens.  
128:30 - Let's put that formula right here. ballpoint 
pens, you know that she's going to spend  
128:36 - $1.50 if she shops at Walmart, three times 
50. Here are some hints for the formula.  
128:44 - In this square, which is G three, we're going 
to multiply the quantity times the price.  
128:52 - So enter your formula once you figure that 
out. After you figure out the first formula,  
128:59 - you'll be able to fill down and calculate all 
the rest of the prices as well. At the very end,  
129:06 - let's put in the total. And so you'll know 
what the total cost is for purchasing supplies  
129:11 - at Walmart. Repeat this same process for another 
column, we're going to figure out the price for  
129:17 - the entire shopping list the dollar trap, and then 
we'll figure out the price again. And obviously,  
129:23 - once you finish, you should have three total 
prices listed down here. After you add up all  
129:28 - of these numbers close. The last thing you'll need 
to do is put a chart on the graph. And so copy the  
129:35 - labels from row two down to the bottom. And when 
you find the totals like I've mentioned here,  
129:40 - you can highlight the entire two rows, create 
your chart and it will be labeled correctly.  
129:47 - Now for the other fellow, we're going 
to have to make a another chart so  
129:51 - copy everything you get from Susan and then 
you could probably move it over to column K  
129:57 - or so and paste all of the information 
Just change the shopping list so that  
130:02 - Tim's list will be hidden and shown instead 
of Susan's, then you'll be finished Good luck.  
130:12 - In this video, in Excel problem solvers, we're 
going to look at a problem that Susan and Tim  
130:17 - are facing. They want to purchase a dog or 
a cat. And so let's see what Susan says.  
130:26 - She says, Hi, I'm Susan, would you help 
me choose a pet. I love both cats and  
130:30 - dogs equally. But I would like to spend 
as little money as possible each year.  
130:36 - compare these expenses in a spreadsheet and show 
me your answer and create a graph. First of all,  
130:43 - notice that she's talking about a year. And so 
at the bottom down here, when it says hints,  
130:50 - it says use a spreadsheet to calculate the total 
cost of ownership for owning a pet for one year.  
130:56 - So we'll just assume one year is the length 
of our expenses, pets, adoptions, dogs or 50,  
131:05 - cats or 90. All expenses include all of 
the vaccinations, spaying and neutering.  
131:12 - However, there are more expenses 
than just buying the cat or the dog.  
131:17 - First of all, this is a list of what 
we consider necessary accessories.  
131:21 - The cat has three items, the dog is 
four, so you have to buy this one time.  
131:27 - The second box shows the ongoing 
expenses, a box of cat food, kitty litter,  
131:35 - and the small print says buy two of each of these 
for my pet each month. And so we'll double that  
131:42 - expense. Each month. The dog has some expenses to 
his dog food is more money, and his dog treats her  
131:49 - also an expense. Here's a good pattern for setting 
up the spreadsheet, you can see that I have  
131:55 - two boxes, and I colored these boxes. So that way 
you can distinguish that there's a section called  
132:01 - initial costs. So these are just one time costs. 
And these are monthly costs. Then we have a column  
132:09 - for the dog, and a column for the cat. When we're 
done, we're going to have a total of how much it  
132:16 - costs to keep the dog for the first year. So 
we'll be adding up all the numbers above it.  
132:23 - What are the initial costs, while 
the purchase price for the dog,  
132:28 - we have to buy a collar a taggable leash, 
and then the initial total will be the sum  
132:33 - of everything above it, the cat will have some of 
these expenses. I think the cat will have a zero  
132:39 - here because it doesn't need a leash. For the 
monthly expenses, remember, there's going to be  
132:45 - food litter and treats. So these will be 
subtotal. And then we're going to multiply  
132:51 - by two because we need to have a monthly total, 
each one of those items was bought twice a month.  
133:00 - For the one year costs, we're going to 
have to take 12 times the monthly total,  
133:04 - and then add it to the initial. So think through 
how each of these costs need to be added in  
133:09 - to get an accurate price for a dog 
and an accurate price for a cat.  
133:15 - When we're done, we will highlight these 
two lines, create a chart and see you'll  
133:20 - have a bar chart that shows the cost 
of a dog compared to the cost of a cat.  
133:26 - So there's a good outline for you remember, this 
is just a partial solution that I'm offering you.  
133:32 - You have to come up with the formulas and 
use the numbers to get an accurate result.  
133:36 - Welcome to the next lesson of Excel problem 
solvers. This is number three, where we're going  
133:40 - to take Susan and Tim and ask them what they want 
to buy. We'll evaluate this with a spreadsheet,  
133:47 - and then hopefully come up with a graph. So 
Susan and Tim are both going on vacation,  
133:53 - and they're going to explore either Caribbean 
cruise, Orlando, or Chicago. First of all,  
134:00 - she says I'm Susan, would you help me pick 
one of these three vacations, my husband and I  
134:06 - like all three vacation ideas, but we 
want to spend as little as possible.  
134:10 - We will fly stay five nights and four days. 
Tell me which one of these will cost the least.  
134:18 - And so we're going to build a spreadsheet to 
answer that question, which one of these will  
134:22 - cost the least? Let's look at the details of what 
kind of vacations they are. The Caribbean cruise  
134:28 - is the simplest, it's $555 with almost everything 
included. The only thing that does not include  
134:34 - it says here is airfare. So we have to buy plane 
tickets to get to Miami. Orlando has theme parks.  
134:43 - And so they're going to spend four days 
and look at each theme park. So for her,  
134:48 - it's going to cost twice the price of each ticket. 
They're not going to rent a car. It says in the  
134:54 - small print. They will spend money on a hotel and 
they estimate $50 per person on food. Each day.  
135:02 - Lastly, we have Chicago. Chicago is a city 
of museums. And so they're going to go visit  
135:07 - the natural history, the Museum of Art, the 
Science Museum and the Broadcast history museum.  
135:12 - And so each of these prices is per person. 
In Chicago, they have to rent a car,  
135:17 - their hotel is a little bit more money, and 
they estimate about $50 per day for food.  
135:24 - And this box over here, we show the costs of the 
airlines. So Miami, Orlando, and Chicago are all  
135:31 - different costs, and those are per person. Now 
let's look at how we would build a spreadsheet.  
135:37 - First of all, we have a column for each 
city. So we have Chicago, Orlando, and Miami,  
135:45 - at the bottom of the page, we're 
eventually going to have a total  
135:48 - for all of these cities. So we'll find out the 
answer down here. And then we'll make a graph.  
135:54 - I've divided the costs up into per person 
expenses. So if you have more people in  
135:59 - your family per person expenses will go up. 
And then hotel expenses, assuming that all  
136:04 - people stay in the same room, it will cost 
the same for two people as it will for four.  
136:10 - And so the hotel is more of a fixed 
cost per night rather than per person.  
136:16 - Now for some of these, we won't 
have a number. For instance,  
136:20 - if we look at Chicago, we will have no money for 
Disneyland, so we can just put zero in there.  
136:27 - Also for like the museum, the Science Museum, we 
will not have a science museum cost in Orlando,  
136:33 - some of these costs will be just zero, it 
appears that there's something missing.  
136:38 - I have hotels and tickets, but there is also 
car rentals. So you might want to include  
136:43 - another car rental expense, somewhere down the 
bottom, and then add that into the subtotal.  
136:50 - So calculate all of the subtotals per person 
expenses, hotel expenses, car expenses,  
136:55 - add them together, compare the three cities 
and give Susan her answer with a bar graph.  
137:01 - Once you have finished with Susan, then you 
can use her work to copy and paste a new chart,  
137:06 - a new bar graph, and you'll have Tim's answers 
as well. Remember, he has two children, so his  
137:11 - per person expenses will be higher. Good luck 
and helping Tim and Susan pick their vacation.  
137:18 - Welcome to excel problem solvers. So Susan, and 
Tim, both would like to buy a new printer, Susan  
137:24 - says would you help me pick one of these three 
printers, I plan to print about 15 pages each day,  
137:30 - so that if days per week, I want the total cost 
to be as low as possible, I expect the printer  
137:36 - to last two years, you'll see that the epsilon 
printer is only $29. And so you might think that  
137:41 - is the best price at the beginning. Until you 
look at the supplies, you'll see that ink is $40  
137:48 - a cartridge. And it will add up quite a bit. Tim, 
on the other hand has a different request. He said  
137:55 - I'm Tim would you help me pick one of these three 
printers, I plan to print about 500 pages each  
138:01 - day. And so his printer will probably be different 
than Susan's. Let's look at the fine print.  
138:09 - First of all, you'll notice that each cartridge 
on the epsilon will only print 200 sheets.  
138:16 - While at the other end, the zero printer 
will print 11,000 pages for a cartridge.  
138:22 - And so the initial price on the 
printer, even though it's high,  
138:26 - may end up being less expensive per page. Here's 
a suggestion for how to set up your spreadsheet.  
138:32 - We'll do columns B, C, and D for each of the 
printers, we'll put in a line for their initial  
138:38 - purchase price. And then we'll put the yellow 
section for the cost of their print per page.  
138:44 - And that's important because even though inkjet 
cartridges are less than LaserJet cartridges,  
138:50 - they don't print nearly as many pages. And 
then for each of these people will have to  
138:55 - compute their expected pages per day. So Susan 
is only expecting 15 per day. This is the number  
139:02 - she will actually print per year. And so you'll 
need a formula to calculate that number. Once we  
139:09 - know the pages per year, we can estimate how 
much it will cost per year because we have a  
139:13 - and then the total printing costs will come here 
at the bottom. That total printing cost added to  
139:19 - the initial purchase cost will give you the 
actual cost for the two years of epsilon.  
139:26 - And so your job is to figure out some of the 
formulas that would make these numbers make sense.  
139:33 - Once you're done, you will highlight the final 
result. And you will create a chart that will  
139:37 - show the differences in each of these printers. 
Similar to the other problems. We're going to have  
139:42 - a section for Susan, and then we'll copy the 
information for to the right side and we will  
139:47 - compute Tim's numbers. And so you should 
have two charts when you're done and find  
139:52 - out what the recommendation is for each of these 
people. Welcome to the last in this series of  
139:58 - Excel problem solvers. On this video, Susan and 
Tim are asking us to help them purchase a car.  
140:06 - Susan says, Would you help me pick one of these 
three cars, I want to spend as little as possible,  
140:12 - I want to drive the car until it has 250,000 
miles, when I assume it will be nearly worthless.  
140:20 - I drive about 30,000 miles every year. 
Thankfully, I have enough money to save so I  
140:26 - don't have to borrow money and pay interest 
on a loan that would cost me an extra 40%.  
140:32 - Let's see the three cars that Susan is 
considering. First of all, she has in mind the  
140:37 - Chevy Spark. It's a small engine that gets good 
gas mileage, she has to pay 15 $100 a year in  
140:44 - insurance. The initial cost for taxes is 1400 
50. And every year she spends $210 for a license.  
140:54 - Compare the other cars they have higher numbers 
for each of those. So the Ford Mustang is 31,000.  
141:01 - The gas mileage is much lower, the insurance and 
taxes and license are all higher. Her third choice  
141:08 - is the escalate. Certainly a luxury car with a 
price of 72,000. Low gas mileage, high insurance,  
141:16 - high taxes and high license fees. Just how 
much more will that be than the other cars?  
141:23 - We'll find out when we make the bar graph 
to compare the total cost of ownership for  
141:28 - all of these cars. Tim said he would also like to 
buy one of these three cars, he wants to spend as  
141:33 - little as possible, he's going to drive the 
car until it has 250,000. He drives 30,000  
141:39 - miles a year. So everything so far is the same as 
Susan. However, the difference is he does not have  
141:44 - enough money to purchase the car. And so to make 
things simple, we are just simply going to add 40%  
141:51 - of the price of the car to his spreadsheet. So 
that will include all the interest in bank fees.  
141:58 - Now let's look at the spreadsheet 
to solve this problem.  
142:02 - On the left side, we have Susan and all of the 
calculations that we need to come up with a  
142:07 - price for which one is going to cost the most. 
We'll put the cars in column B, C and D spark  
142:13 - Mustang in escalate. The yellow section at the top 
we'll talk about the initial costs. So this is the  
142:19 - price that she pays the day she buys the car, 
she has to pay the original price plus taxes.  
142:26 - The more complicated question is how much 
does it cost to own this car every year?  
142:31 - And there are three costs that we need to add 
together. We have insurance, license and gas.  
142:37 - How much are we going to pay for gas? That's a 
more complicated question than just looking at the  
142:42 - price at the pump. We have to know several things. 
And so we have a blue calculation area from row 12  
142:49 - to 16. First of all, we need to ask the question, 
how much does she drive? How many miles every  
142:56 - year? What is the miles per gallon or the mpg 
for her car? How much is she paying for gas.  
143:05 - And then we will know how much 
she pays every year for gas.  
143:09 - Add those three together, and we will have total 
annual costs insurance plus license plus the gas.  
143:16 - Now the question is, how much is this car going 
to cost over the entire lifetime of the car? Well,  
143:22 - first of all, we know how long she wants to drive 
she said 250,000 miles after which we will assume  
143:28 - that the car has basically no value left and 
she can give it away to a friend. To find out  
143:33 - how long the car will live. We have to ask how 
many miles does she plan to drive each year?  
143:38 - What is her goal, which is 250,000. And then we 
can use those two numbers to find out the total  
143:45 - lifetime expectancy of the car. Finally, we will 
arrive at the bottom where we get the calculations  
143:51 - for the annual cost of the car times the 
number of years that we expect the car to live.  
143:57 - We add in the initial price of the costs. And we 
have a total lifetime cost of the car it might  
144:03 - surprise you that you'll see the numbers up in 
the range of where you expect to pay for a house  
144:09 - down a little further. We will calculate the final 
answer in row 27 and 28. We will calculate the  
144:17 - average cost of a year. So we know how long the 
car expects to go how many years it expects to go.  
144:25 - We also know how many dollars we have total. 
And so now we can find out what each year will  
144:31 - cost for the spark Mustang and escalate. 
highlight these last three numbers with  
144:36 - their labels create a bar chart and you will 
give Susan some good information on how much  
144:42 - more it will cost to buy luxury cars. On the 
right side of the equation we will have Tim  
144:48 - Tim is going to be calculating almost the 
same values except him doesn't have any  
144:54 - money saved. And so the initial cost of his car 
is going to be 40% higher In what Susan paid,  
145:01 - and so that 40% includes all the interest in 
bank fees. So everything else should be the  
145:06 - same. He's driving the same number of miles and 
he expects to go 250,000 before the end of life.  
145:13 - And so when you're finished with Tim, you'll have 
a similar graph. But you might find his expenses  
145:19 - quite a bit higher than Susan because he doesn't 
have enough money to pay for the car in cash.  
145:33 - Congratulations, you've made it to the end of 
the course if you've survived this long, you  
145:38 - have gone from the beginning to an expert person
