00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30
00:02 - days today is day 11 and all about
00:04 - internet explorer unfortunately so now
00:06 - before we go forward internet explorer
00:08 - has taken a lot of liberty to try and
00:10 - improve their software and they're on
00:12 - like version 15 or something crazy right
00:14 - now i don't really pay attention because
00:15 - i don't really care but hopefully you're
00:17 - watching this at some point in the
00:18 - future where none of this is an issue
00:20 - anymore however there are some people
00:22 - who still use internet explorer 9 and
00:24 - below which is crazy talk but
00:27 - luckily in css 3 and css we can we can
00:31 - kind of make some accommodations and
00:34 - in my case i just like to remove the
00:35 - styles for those browsers all together
00:37 - so i'm going to show you how to do that
00:38 - with something called conditional
00:39 - comments jump over here and check this
00:42 - out you can see here i'm going to show
00:44 - you what a conditional comment looks
00:45 - like and what it does
00:48 - so basic conditional comment looks like
00:50 - this if i e and it's wrapped in
00:52 - basically an html comment and then you
00:54 - can put any html in between including
00:56 - links to css like a different ie style
00:59 - sheet
01:00 - and then you close it off like so
01:02 - you could select different types of
01:04 - browsers internet explorer versions
01:06 - rather six seven eight nine by using the
01:09 - following conditional comments
01:10 - you can use a specific uh conditional
01:13 - comment for
01:14 - uh say a version of internet explorer or
01:17 - lower so if
01:18 - lte stands for less than or equal to ie
01:21 - six seven eight or nine that styles
01:23 - internet explorer six or less seven or
01:25 - less eight or less nine or less or
01:27 - rather those browsers register those
01:29 - comments and then we have uh the
01:32 - opposite of that which is greater than
01:33 - or equal to so you could style greater
01:35 - than or equal to ie six seven eight or
01:37 - nine
01:38 - or i just like to use the
01:40 - uh the catch all if i e so that's
01:43 - internet explorer six through nine
01:46 - and that will be recognized and rendered
01:48 - by those specific browsers
01:50 - so jump over here in our code editor and
01:53 - all we have in day 11 you can go ahead
01:56 - and download that is
01:57 - an index file and an ie.css file gonna
02:00 - run through them show you what's going
02:01 - on and then we can be on our merry way
02:03 - and not think about ie anymore so
02:06 - right here you can see in the head of
02:08 - our html i have a conditional comment
02:11 - that's selecting ie 6 through 9 and i'm
02:13 - just adding
02:14 - an ie style sheet
02:16 - so only internet explorer 6 or 9 will
02:19 - recognize and render that comment and
02:21 - then we'll tie into our css file which
02:24 - looks like this
02:26 - basically i'm just
02:28 - i did an asterisk selector which is a
02:30 - catch-all everything i'm removing the
02:32 - background color and line height
02:33 - resetting that really aggressively
02:35 - removing the course files button and the
02:37 - level two heading uh tab that sits on
02:40 - the side of of the container in the web
02:42 - page that we have here
02:44 - and then i found a complete css reset at
02:47 - this link that's just an aggressive
02:49 - reset just resets everything to just
02:51 - basic black and white text and that's
02:53 - all i want for ie six through nine
02:55 - because i don't wanna have to
02:56 - accommodate those browsers so i just
02:58 - show them my markup which if it's
03:00 - semantic they should be able to read it
03:01 - and get the meaning of the website
03:03 - anyway so
03:05 - let me just go back to our browser or
03:07 - index.html file here and i want to show
03:09 - you one last thing i've done right under
03:10 - the conditional comments i've put
03:13 - conditional comments through from six
03:15 - through nine and basically just some
03:17 - text so if you're this is a test method
03:19 - so if you're viewing it from ie 6 7 8 or
03:22 - 9 you'll see the proper the respective
03:25 - comment for the browser that you are
03:27 - using so why don't we test that i've
03:29 - taken the liberty of uploading this to
03:32 - my website on my domain
03:35 - and uh there's a webpage website called
03:38 - netrenderer.com
03:39 - where you can basically get a screen
03:41 - grab of
03:42 - an ie browser of a live web page so if
03:47 - you go to netrenderer and type in
03:49 - bradhusty.ca dev u e w w
03:53 - uh and choose internet explorer nine
03:55 - because for some reason seven and eight
03:57 - don't work on my website but nine does
03:59 - and if i hit render
04:01 - basically what's going to happen
04:04 - is it's going to take a few seconds and
04:06 - then it's going to give me a rendering
04:08 - screenshot of what internet explorer 9
04:10 - how it sees my website so here you go
04:12 - it's just basic black and white it's got
04:14 - the text you can read it
04:16 - and then if you notice here you're
04:17 - viewing with internet explorer 9. you
04:19 - can't see that in my chrome browser
04:21 - because obviously it's not ie but here
04:23 - it is you're viewing with internet
04:24 - explorer 9 and the styles are completely
04:26 - wiped so that all they can do is read it
04:28 - perfect that's all i really need so i
04:31 - know that was kind of a quick lesson but
04:34 - feel free if you really care to
04:37 - utilize this strategy on your own blogs
04:39 - and websites
04:40 - if you just want to remove the styles
04:42 - altogether you could do simply what i
04:43 - did or if you want to take a little bit
04:44 - more of an accommodating approach you
04:46 - can do that as well play around there
04:48 - are a number of different uh
04:50 - browsing test browser testing tools such
04:52 - as browser stack
04:54 - but that's paid whereas netrender is
04:56 - just a screen grab of what ie sees your
04:59 - website uh how it sees your website
05:02 - so really that's kind of all i didn't
05:04 - want to spend a lot of time on this
05:06 - because it's quite simple conditional
05:08 - comment an ie css file and just remove
05:11 - the styles pretty straightforward
05:13 - uh i hope you're having a great day and
05:16 - tomorrow i'll see you in day 12 which is
05:20 - gonna be fun we're gonna be playing
05:21 - around with some css3 variables
05:24 - [Music]
