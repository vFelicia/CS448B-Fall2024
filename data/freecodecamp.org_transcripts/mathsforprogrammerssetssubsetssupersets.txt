00:00 - In this video, I'll be introducing the concept of subsets and supersets
00:05 - The dots on the board here represent elements of a set.
00:10 - The lines represent the sets themselves.
00:13 - These lines have been labeled B, A and U
00:16 - We can say that B is a subset of A because B contains...because all elements of B are elements of A
00:26 - We can also say that B is a proper subset of A because all elements of B are elements of A
00:34 - and there are elements of A that are not within the set B.
00:40 - We can also say that the set A is a superset of the set B because A contains all of the elements of B.
00:50 - And being even more specific, we can say that A is a proper superset of B because A contains all elements of B
01:00 - and there are elements of A that are not elements of B.
01:03 - What we cannot say is that U is a proper subset of A.
01:09 - Although the circle here is bigger than A, it just takes up more space, it doesn't contain any more elements
01:18 - So all the elements...so U contains all elements of A
01:22 - however, U does not contain any extra elements.
01:26 - So U is a subset of A, and A is actually a subset of U
01:31 - U is a superset of A, and A is also a superset of U
01:34 - So the sets A and U in this case are actually equal.
