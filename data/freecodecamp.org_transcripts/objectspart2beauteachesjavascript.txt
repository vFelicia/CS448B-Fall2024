00:00 - i went over the basics of objects in a
00:02 - previous video now i will talk about
00:04 - other things you can do with objects you
00:06 - can see the list of what we will cover
00:07 - on the screen
00:08 - the first thing is using objects for
00:10 - lookups
00:12 - objects can be thought of as key value
00:14 - storage like a dictionary if you have
00:16 - tabular data you can use an object to
00:18 - look up values in the data here's an
00:20 - example of a simple reverse alphabet
00:22 - lookup so you just create the data you
00:24 - want in
00:25 - in this alpha object so one is z 2 is y
00:28 - 3 is x and then so on i'm not going to
00:31 - put all the letters in there but then
00:33 - you can just do console.log
00:35 - alpha2 so you can find out what letter
00:37 - is the second letter in the reverse
00:39 - alphabet next up is removing object
00:42 - properties
00:44 - so i'm going to create this object here
00:46 - dishes
00:48 - with plates eight cups tens and so on
00:50 - and if you just do delete the name of
00:53 - the object and then the name of the
00:54 - property it's going to delete that that
00:57 - property
00:58 - let me run that and you can see right in
01:01 - here there are no more cups and the y up
01:04 - here from the reverse lookup now testing
01:07 - objects for properties sometimes it is
01:09 - useful to check if the property of a
01:11 - given object exists or not i briefly
01:13 - discussed this in my previous video you
01:15 - just use the has own property method on
01:17 - the object so dishes that has on
01:19 - property plates dishes that has on
01:21 - property cups we're checking if we have
01:23 - the we have the property plates and cups
01:25 - we deleted the property cups so we have
01:28 - true it has plates and false it does not
01:30 - have cups okay now we're going to talk
01:32 - about accessing and modifying nested
01:35 - objects
01:36 - object properties can be nested to any
01:38 - depth and their values can be any type
01:41 - of data supported by javascript
01:42 - including arrays and even other objects
01:46 - so the sub properties of objects can be
01:48 - accessed by chaining together the dot or
01:50 - bracket notation
01:52 - in this object called our stores we have
01:54 - two properties desk and cabinet but each
01:57 - of the properties desk and cabinet
01:59 - contains an object as the value so
02:01 - here's an object that just contains the
02:03 - property drawer
02:04 - here's an object that contains the
02:06 - object top drawer top drawer and bottom
02:09 - drawer and inside the top drawer we have
02:12 - another object so we can access an
02:16 - object within another object by using
02:18 - the dot or bracket notation so right
02:20 - here we have our storage dot cabinet
02:22 - here's the dot notation to access the
02:25 - cabinet and then we're going to use the
02:26 - bracket notification which you always
02:29 - need the bracket notification anytime
02:31 - the property has a space in it
02:34 - so we're going to get to this top drawer
02:36 - and then we're going to use the dot
02:38 - notation again to get inside the folder
02:40 - too and then here we're just looking at
02:43 - inside our storage.depth.drawer
02:46 - which you right here you can also use
02:49 - the bracket and dot notation to assign
02:53 - a new value to a property that's nested
02:55 - inside an object so here we have the
02:57 - cabnet topdrawer.folder2 that's what we
03:00 - have up here but instead of just
03:02 - console.logging it we are going to use
03:04 - the assignment operator the equal sign
03:06 - to set that to cake recipe and then i'm
03:09 - going to log it again
03:12 - first of all in folder 2 we have secrets
03:15 - you can see here
03:16 - and then we're just going to check
03:17 - what's in the drawer which is a stapler
03:19 - which you can see here then we're going
03:21 - to assign folder to the cake recipe and
03:24 - we're going to log folder 2 again and
03:26 - now it's not secrets anymore it's just a
03:28 - cake recipe which anybody can learn and
03:31 - the last thing i'm going to cover in
03:32 - this video is how to generate an array
03:34 - of all object keys and the object keys
03:37 - are just the properties we can generate
03:38 - an array that contains all the keys
03:40 - stored in an object using the
03:42 - object.keys method and passing in an
03:45 - object as argument this will return an
03:47 - array with strings representing each
03:49 - property in the object so
03:51 - we're going to call object.keys you're
03:54 - not going to put the reference to the
03:56 - object you're going to actually put the
03:57 - word
03:59 - keys and then you're going to put what
04:01 - the object is inside
04:03 - these parentheses here and you can see
04:05 - in our storage we just have desk and
04:08 - cabinet because it's only going to give
04:11 - the first level it's not going to go
04:12 - into the object to get the the second
04:15 - the nested object well thanks for
04:17 - watching my name is beau carnes don't
04:19 - forget to subscribe and remember use
04:20 - your code for good
