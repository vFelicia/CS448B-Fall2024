00:00 - [Music]
00:12 - thank you
00:13 - it's a
00:14 - an enormous pleasure for me to be here
00:16 - today and
00:17 - when i rehearsed and went over the
00:19 - target first i was wondering whether i
00:21 - should say something along the lines
00:22 - that i'm not sure whether
00:25 - i'm throwing mark under the bus or he's
00:27 - throwing me under the bus here so we'll
00:29 - see how this turns out
00:32 - i'm jens i'm a web developer and i want
00:34 - to start very simple here and
00:37 - the
00:38 - simplicity here should probably start
00:40 - with that
00:41 - i only want to say that i've been web
00:43 - development for about 20 years now
00:46 - i worked for small companies for
00:49 - medium-sized companies for larger
00:51 - companies and i had the pleasure to work
00:53 - freelance and as a consultant
00:56 - and to work on my own projects and on
00:58 - other people's projects and all of that
01:00 - and researching a bit and
01:02 - publishing and blah blah blah so the
01:05 - only thing i want to say with that is i
01:07 - i feel
01:08 - grateful
01:09 - that i got to
01:11 - get to know our field from a variety of
01:14 - angles and i'm very happy about that and
01:17 - i'm happy about that particularly
01:18 - because i think our field and i like to
01:21 - be liberal with terms sometimes some
01:23 - people might call that quite in precise
01:26 - but i like to call it liberal
01:28 - that i also lump together web
01:30 - development and web design at times
01:32 - so here i want to keep up a development
01:34 - focus but don't mind me sometimes
01:37 - bleeding into web design as well and i
01:40 - think overall
01:41 - and that is is one thing i want to
01:44 - emphasize here now in the next next few
01:46 - minutes is how great of a field we are
01:49 - in and how great the neighboring fields
01:51 - are
01:52 - and i'm also a thing that i was
01:55 - wondering about when preparing this was
01:57 - whether i should really keep this
01:59 - metaphor that i had in my mind and it's
02:01 - one that i stole from
02:03 - someone who is talking to writers and i
02:07 - like to read a lot and i like to pick up
02:09 - books where on any kind of subject and
02:12 - as i publish and as i write a lot i
02:14 - picked up a book about writing and this
02:16 - book was by rachel aaron i believe and
02:19 - it was one of those heavily promoted
02:21 - books on amazon and i read it and i took
02:23 - a few things out of there overall
02:26 - contain some nice advice and then one
02:28 - metaphor stuck in my head because i feel
02:30 - like not only am i terrible person to
02:32 - tell jokes
02:34 - i don't always feel like i can tell good
02:36 - stories
02:37 - and so she used that metaphor of if you
02:40 - want to tell the story you take your
02:42 - characters you put them in the tree
02:45 - and that is supposed to symbolize at
02:47 - least you can pick one tree there and
02:50 - you put it all on fire
02:53 - and then you try to save your characters
02:56 - and i later thought like is this a good
02:58 - way of structuring a presentation and i
03:00 - didn't think about it any further that
03:02 - happens and so i will start with that we
03:06 - will put some things into a tree
03:09 - and
03:10 - there are five things or families of
03:12 - things i want to emphasize in this first
03:14 - part
03:15 - things i find exciting about our field
03:18 - about web development
03:20 - and design
03:21 - and
03:22 - also when starting to prepare
03:25 - i thought like well the first thing to
03:27 - notice is like how
03:29 - it's really easy to get into our field
03:31 - the
03:33 - first thing to come to my mind was that
03:35 - there is low equipment cost for instance
03:37 - anything with a screen would do any
03:38 - computer with the screen would do now
03:40 - that seems a bit very simple so i
03:42 - thought the next good thing would
03:44 - probably be
03:45 - that it's really easy for us to start
03:48 - get into our field
03:50 - and
03:52 - i've made the mistake in earlier years
03:55 - that whenever people approach me about
03:57 - how do i learn web development how do i
03:59 - learn web design i scared them by
04:02 - telling them read the specs
04:04 - go and read the specifications and then
04:06 - people normally left and went elsewhere
04:09 - and it's still something that i try to
04:12 - not give this advice anymore but what i
04:14 - like about this is if you think about
04:16 - other industries and other fields then
04:19 - you notice that oftentimes it's much
04:21 - more obscure
04:23 - and much more expensive to actually get
04:25 - to excellent sources in order to learn a
04:27 - craft and i think we're in a kind of a
04:31 - first i thought like privilege but that
04:33 - would push it probably but we are in a
04:35 - great situation that we do actually sit
04:38 - on heaps of materials of excellent
04:40 - quality for free
04:42 - so specifications and rfcs dry as they
04:45 - may be they're still excellent in order
04:47 - to start getting into our field and then
04:50 - for practicing
04:51 - that of course is also very important
04:53 - for us in order to actually learn our
04:55 - craft
04:57 - and for practicing there are also hosts
04:58 - of interesting options i think
05:01 - and the first one probably being that
05:03 - it's very easy to just work with local
05:05 - tests and local files so we can fire up
05:07 - text editor here in doctype html title
05:10 - foo p bar and as you can tell like i'm
05:12 - alluding to a very simple simple form
05:15 - but valid form of html that you can then
05:17 - save and open your browser and then you
05:19 - see like bar like as we just keyed in
05:22 - the content for a paragraph very simple
05:24 - to this day by the way whenever i want
05:27 - to test something css or something like
05:29 - that i just work with static files local
05:31 - files local test files very simple and
05:33 - quick to do
05:34 - and then another thing then that is i
05:37 - think in a nice
05:40 - peculiarity or characteristic for our
05:41 - field are of course that we can use and
05:43 - work with our own websites and if i can
05:46 - get a quick show of hand who here has
05:48 - their own website
05:49 - [Music]
05:51 - that is a good number and and and i feel
05:54 - like you will all know from your own
05:56 - experience then how this doesn't just
05:58 - start with the practice that you get by
06:00 - running your own website but it starts a
06:02 - thing with a deeper commitment
06:04 - so you own your own side you feel
06:06 - responsible for it you feel committed to
06:08 - it and then starts all that practice
06:10 - that you get and be it that you start
06:12 - and
06:14 - that by the way these days is my
06:15 - recommendation really for people who
06:17 - want to get into our field to actually
06:19 - start with our own website because of
06:20 - the commitment because of the practice
06:22 - we get even when it's just a business
06:24 - card type page even that can be useful
06:28 - the commitment
06:30 - the options that we have to try things
06:32 - to design to code to to work with
06:36 - something that we own and that we
06:37 - identify with to some degree hopefully
06:39 - not too much
06:41 - and then of course like we have other
06:43 - people's websites and i think ironically
06:45 - at first i thought like i make a snarky
06:46 - remark about that how we run other
06:48 - people's websites
06:50 - and sometimes bad things happen there
06:52 - but that would be a bit too much because
06:54 - normally very good things happen with
06:55 - that because yes we do practice and yes
06:58 - we also sometimes we need that as a
07:01 - playground too in order to grow and
07:03 - learn as professionals
07:05 - this is this is useful but it hones our
07:07 - skills and we're mostly in the line of
07:09 - working with other people's sites and so
07:12 - there are like all these practice
07:13 - opportunities which i believe are
07:15 - actually unique about our field
07:18 - the really special thing then about web
07:21 - development and design then i think is
07:22 - the great power it really comes with
07:26 - and also at first i thought about should
07:28 - i go and talk a bit about full stack
07:30 - stuff
07:32 - and i do struggle a bit with that term
07:34 - and i do struggle a bit with that term
07:36 - when i pick up books again i said like i
07:38 - like to pick up random things and there
07:41 - was this book lately a great list of
07:43 - resources about front-end development
07:45 - and the author
07:47 - tried to define full stack development
07:49 - and said like well it's really hard to
07:51 - define
07:52 - but that is of course not a real
07:54 - definition then for something but it
07:56 - felt like to me like yes that is a bit
07:58 - unclear
08:00 - and the worst thing for me was always
08:03 - the
08:03 - implications a term like this may have
08:06 - for quality
08:08 - if quality is a priority for our work
08:10 - because if you have a blurry term and
08:12 - you throw in a host of technologies then
08:15 - does that all imply that person is an
08:17 - expert in all these technologies would
08:19 - be an interesting thing but it's not
08:21 - that important here really because i
08:23 - think we have a much better term a much
08:26 - more interesting term and a much more
08:28 - powerful term that we can inherit
08:30 - ironically
08:32 - from the agency world where it's about
08:34 - full service
08:36 - and i find full service really really
08:38 - really interesting because so full
08:40 - service first and foremost means in the
08:43 - agency run
08:44 - if someone needs a website or an app
08:48 - you develop a concept you design you
08:50 - code you deploy and you launch you
08:53 - monitor you optimize and if you're lucky
08:56 - i like to be a bit cynical about things
08:58 - when you are lucky then it's all it also
09:01 - gets maintained
09:02 - of course in the agency world this is
09:04 - tricky because normally you need
09:06 - maintenance contracts and blah blah blah
09:07 - but maintenance in the agency world to
09:09 - me seems always a bit tricky and
09:11 - difficult but more from a client angle
09:13 - actually than from an agency angle
09:16 - because from the client side you need to
09:17 - think about maintenance going down the
09:19 - road in many cases but back to full
09:21 - service
09:23 - as professionals as people working in
09:25 - our fields
09:27 - we many of us are venture to say work
09:30 - either for agencies at some point in
09:32 - their career or the way with agencies at
09:34 - some point in their career or they run
09:36 - their own websites as we've just seen
09:38 - like many of us here
09:40 - and in these capacities
09:42 - we do touch on this i believe we are all
09:45 - familiar with this to some degree we all
09:48 - write some concept or have some idea
09:50 - about something conceptual at times we
09:53 - do design we develop when we have this
09:56 - development focus of course we do code
09:59 - and we bring stuff online and we monitor
10:01 - and we optimize and we market and
10:02 - everything so i think all of us have a
10:06 - full service kind of
10:08 - profile and yes to varying degrees some
10:11 - of us are well let's assume like
10:13 - developers will normally have their
10:15 - strength there some of us have also
10:17 - certain design background or even
10:19 - stronger there and others will find it
10:21 - easier to say optimize something whether
10:24 - that's for search engines or for
10:26 - conversion or whatnot
10:28 - and then others like yeah have again
10:31 - different profiles for me personally
10:34 - i guess i tend to always overestimate my
10:37 - design capabilities
10:39 - but i'm definitely very sure that i have
10:41 - no marketing talent so there i know
10:44 - where i stand in the full service run a
10:46 - little bit at least
10:47 - the thing again is the power now
10:50 - so when we have an idea about something
10:52 - about an app or inside we are in the
10:54 - situation that for us we we can
10:56 - quite possibly actually execute it
10:59 - quality considerations left aside now
11:02 - or at least we know for the things that
11:04 - we can't do
11:05 - who we can contact who we can work with
11:08 - what we can do and we all probably know
11:10 - people like who approach us and say hey
11:13 - i have this idea
11:14 - about this app or a site
11:17 - and then they talk about the idea and we
11:18 - feel like oh
11:20 - it sounds kind of interesting maybe we
11:21 - want to contribute in some
11:23 - in some way and then we don't have the
11:24 - time or they wouldn't
11:26 - i don't know it's just not financially
11:28 - interesting or anything like that and
11:30 - then months later we meet them again and
11:32 - nothing has happened
11:34 - because they are literally i think
11:37 - we meet people like that they have great
11:38 - ideas but they don't have any idea where
11:41 - to start they don't know what to do they
11:43 - don't even know how to ask well
11:44 - apparently they ask us and we should
11:46 - know and we could probably do something
11:47 - if we have the time and the interest and
11:49 - stuff but the point here is
11:52 - that we are actually in the situation to
11:54 - execute on that and i think this is one
11:56 - of the greatest things about being in
11:58 - our field like what a unique situation
12:01 - and position we're in
12:03 - and then there's complexity and at first
12:05 - that might sound
12:07 - odd right i mean
12:08 - it doesn't exactly sound like something
12:10 - to be excited about
12:12 - but i believe it is because um
12:16 - actually thinking about i used to work
12:17 - as a factory line worker at some point
12:19 - as a summer job
12:20 - and after day one or two i didn't need
12:23 - this belt anymore that other people were
12:25 - using first for the screws and stuff not
12:27 - to say that i was so quick or something
12:29 - like that but the work was so damn
12:30 - boring
12:31 - that i was adding excitement by i don't
12:33 - know like changing the way so i walked
12:35 - around the line and stuff like that in
12:37 - order to work on this and there were
12:38 - people like working on this for 20 years
12:41 - and then most of the students working
12:43 - there were already fed up with this
12:44 - after two hours
12:46 - so
12:47 - it was really interesting to see that
12:49 - and we we are certainly not in the field
12:51 - like that
12:52 - but there is literally so much
12:54 - complexity
12:56 - that i think it challenges us in very
12:59 - interesting and very constructive and
13:01 - very useful ways and i actually believe
13:03 - we should accept these challenges
13:05 - sometimes for me people are a bit fed up
13:07 - like oh my gosh web development last 20
13:09 - years changed so much like
13:13 - all these
13:14 - things
13:15 - and then they don't want to then they
13:16 - don't feel motivated anymore and they
13:18 - regret like that things have changed the
13:20 - way they change but i think we should
13:22 - accept that and we can't even feel
13:23 - excited about it
13:25 - and also as a little story in the early
13:27 - 2000s i was working for a java software
13:29 - company
13:31 - i was the only in in-house web developer
13:34 - i was working on the corporate side and
13:35 - i worked on client side
13:37 - and these were the days
13:39 - really dark days where even netscape 4
13:42 - had to be considered and there was ie5
13:44 - and ie6 and nothing really worked
13:46 - and compatibility issues and support
13:49 - issues and still at days where we had
13:52 - tightened the grip on html because we
13:54 - all wanted to write this strict xhtml
13:57 - and we wanted to use those 100
14:00 - properties that we had in css
14:02 - and now we're approaching 400 or
14:04 - something like that which really like
14:06 - it's not just linear growth like things
14:08 - got really complex with css
14:12 - and i'm really torn on whether i should
14:13 - get started on that or not
14:16 - but complexity so i was bored i was like
14:20 - okay i approached one of the founders
14:22 - i'm like lars
14:24 - i want to become a software developer
14:26 - and that is actually one thing i
14:27 - wouldn't say now
14:30 - and i i wanted to be a software
14:31 - developer and he's like sure we pair you
14:33 - up with our programmers and here are
14:35 - some things you can work on here is a
14:37 - book and i started reading bruce eckel i
14:39 - think thinking on java i don't i'm not
14:41 - even sure how many thinking on books he
14:42 - has written and i started doing that
14:45 - and
14:47 - i was just lucky that i started reading
14:48 - other books
14:50 - i started reading steve cook's don't
14:51 - make me think
14:53 - and nielsen's homepage usability and
14:55 - then stanford university's bj fox book
14:57 - on persuasive technology which is a
14:59 - really interesting book still about
15:01 - human computer interaction
15:03 - i read robert bringer's elements of
15:04 - typographic style
15:06 - and also a lot of books by edward tufte
15:08 - on information design
15:10 - and i can highly recommend tufty really
15:13 - because not just for our field as
15:14 - professionals
15:17 - but in general because we deal with
15:19 - information design in a lot of other
15:21 - places of course in the media and
15:23 - newspapers and there is astonishing
15:25 - degree
15:26 - of
15:27 - problems like with graphs and charts and
15:30 - they sometimes distort the information
15:32 - that we really get and i think tufty
15:34 - gives a nice very pleasant access to
15:37 - this matter so it's quite enjoyable to
15:40 - deal and to actually learn about the
15:42 - subject and all the books that are
15:43 - listed i think like we most of us would
15:45 - have read one of those books if not more
15:48 - or all of them so they're really
15:50 - excellent books and i was just lucky
15:51 - that i ran into all this excellent
15:53 - literature
15:54 - and yes it's not development stuff
15:57 - but i realized
15:58 - wow
16:00 - this isn't boring
16:01 - there is actually so much more to our
16:03 - field and it all relates to
16:06 - my and our work so for me of course back
16:09 - then it was this personal decision like
16:10 - did i want to stay in web development or
16:12 - when do i want to get out of there and i
16:14 - stayed
16:15 - and it was that moment where i realized
16:17 - no this is not boring there's a lot of
16:19 - complexity and this is really
16:20 - challenging this is really interesting
16:22 - this is really cool
16:24 - and and i believe
16:25 - [Music]
16:26 - well the excitement carries me
16:29 - through each day yeah so
16:32 - complexity
16:34 - then now as we progress from how we get
16:36 - into our field to discovering and
16:39 - acquiring powers
16:40 - to getting to appreciate the complexity
16:43 - of our field
16:44 - then we see that we can also give back
16:48 - and i see prime two prime ways of giving
16:51 - back to the community into the field and
16:53 - that is one on the other on the one hand
16:55 - that is open contributed to open source
16:57 - projects
16:59 - and then two doing translation work and
17:01 - if i can get some hands again like who
17:03 - he contributes or has contributed to
17:04 - open source projects
17:07 - and who here contributes with
17:09 - translations
17:12 - this is cool like i suspected that on
17:14 - the translation end we might be a few it
17:16 - might be fewer people
17:18 - i think this is actually the really this
17:20 - is a very interesting piece because we
17:22 - are
17:23 - and we are getting to learn more about
17:25 - accessibility i think today like we are
17:28 - actually making content accessible so
17:30 - we're we're helping that more people can
17:33 - get access to
17:34 - let's hope excellent information so
17:36 - whenever you read an accent article or
17:39 - whenever we read a super boring spec we
17:42 - can go out and translate it and make it
17:43 - available in our mother tongue or
17:45 - whatever we are capable of speaking and
17:48 - that is great and then of course
17:51 - we can
17:54 - so apart from yeah making that
17:56 - accessible we we and helping helping the
17:59 - field this way and helping the projects
18:00 - this way of course like if when we run
18:02 - our website we host the contents there
18:04 - we sometimes get a nice kickback too
18:06 - just as this extra incentive if we then
18:08 - choose or if that's important for us
18:11 - on the other hand for open source
18:13 - contributions
18:14 - they're
18:15 - the only thing that i want to point out
18:17 - probably is that there's no to
18:19 - no change or no contribution that is too
18:22 - small
18:23 - uh i believe it's very important or it
18:25 - does not it's not necessary that we
18:26 - become full-time contributors to a
18:29 - project but that small edits like
18:31 - whether that's fixing typos improving
18:34 - code snippets and so on go a long way
18:36 - actually in contributing and helping
18:38 - other people in other projects and for
18:40 - me personally that means whenever i folk
18:42 - a repository and i go over something
18:45 - and i have routine checks and routine
18:48 - scripts go over my code base and
18:49 - sometimes say they would compress images
18:51 - or something like that i would play that
18:52 - back into the repository
18:54 - and i think these small things are
18:56 - absolutely legitimate and they help
18:58 - so it's not needed that we say become
19:00 - like yeah again like we invest a few
19:02 - hours every week in order to become like
19:05 - really like strong contributors and
19:08 - supporters of an open source project
19:10 - this can be simple things and small
19:11 - things that we can contribute and i
19:13 - think this is pretty awesome about our
19:15 - field that we can actually do this so
19:17 - that we have this option to give back
19:20 - and then as a fifth point that our
19:23 - family of points if you want that like
19:25 - to call out is also that option
19:28 - we share this with other fields of
19:30 - course but it's still a bit different
19:31 - for us the option that we publish our
19:34 - ideas or commentary or research that we
19:38 - can do this again another benefit when
19:40 - we run our own site we can do this there
19:44 - and then we can do this for magazines
19:46 - and we can do this for publishers
19:48 - and we have a great opportunity there or
19:50 - great possibilities there in order to
19:53 - again like learn and grow through
19:56 - teaching in a way and then also to build
19:58 - a reputation this way and i find that's
20:00 - unique and if not for the medium because
20:02 - this is our medium and there are
20:04 - probably more options and easier and
20:06 - simpler options for us to go out there
20:09 - and publish than this for other fields
20:11 - we have several advantages there
20:14 - with these things i want to close this
20:15 - first part
20:17 - and move on to
20:18 - setting everything up on fire
20:20 - and the way i want to do this is
20:22 - actually not analogous like i will not
20:24 - take the points that i made earlier and
20:26 - try to refute them or anything like that
20:28 - what i rather like to say to do is like
20:30 - take some
20:32 - perhaps different aspects
20:33 - one for instance practicing
20:39 - and that is such a big topic actually
20:41 - because practice is really important for
20:43 - us i hope we can agree on this it's
20:45 - important that we touch code as
20:47 - developers need to be able to code
20:49 - and as designers we should also be able
20:51 - to design something
20:53 - now and it's clear to us that when
20:55 - someone
20:57 - registers a domain a dreamhost does a
21:00 - one-click install of wordpress
21:03 - goes to squarespace and generates a logo
21:05 - goes to paletton and generates some
21:07 - colors
21:08 - and then goes back and downloads the
21:10 - theme and changes some colors and
21:13 - updates the logo at that so a developer
21:15 - nor a designer
21:17 - anyone can do that and of course what
21:18 - i'm referring to is an entire line of
21:20 - business that allows people to set up
21:23 - sites like that
21:24 - but we have similar situations in other
21:26 - ways in other aspects of our work
21:29 - because if you want to really push it on
21:31 - the other extreme if that's developers
21:35 - we just go and write our css write some
21:38 - selectors
21:40 - some declarations
21:42 - we test and then well off we go
21:45 - pre-processor linter
21:47 - who cares and i exaggerate of course
21:51 - but if you think about it then what is
21:53 - the difference really so we leave
21:55 - everything
21:56 - that is related to the craft really
21:59 - to tools
22:01 - because anyone here
22:03 - not anyone here anyone outside we could
22:05 - ask like hey
22:07 - this is the basic syntax of a style
22:08 - sheet how about you go and write
22:10 - something
22:12 - and the question sometimes is like is
22:13 - that is there a noticeable difference
22:15 - then they might struggle a bit like
22:17 - finding like the declarations that they
22:19 - need in order to do something and of
22:20 - course it would take some work
22:22 - but what is the difference really if at
22:24 - the end of the day at the end of our
22:25 - work we leave everything else up to the
22:27 - tools
22:29 - by cleaning it up sorting it
22:31 - like optimizing it in whatever fashion
22:34 - and i do not want to say that our way of
22:37 - writing css this way is so so wrong
22:41 - and i will not make suggestions here
22:44 - but it goes beyond that we have other
22:46 - tools that do similar things for us and
22:49 - the trickiest thing is
22:51 - we want that to not just because of
22:53 - convenience
22:54 - but we actually go out there and this is
22:55 - a page of the google book where at least
22:57 - where i picked it up is like whenever
22:59 - you see things being done repeatedly and
23:02 - you can automate them then go and
23:03 - automate
23:05 - like for efficiency and productivity
23:07 - that is really important
23:08 - and that there's a conflict there
23:11 - so if we go and try to automate
23:13 - everything and try to use tools for
23:14 - everything use scripts anywhere
23:17 - then that has an impact on our craft and
23:19 - we need to be
23:20 - aware of this that's probably all i want
23:23 - to say here this is one danger that we
23:26 - need to watch out for
23:27 - and i've at some point
23:31 - pushed out this idea certainly not new
23:33 - certainly not just coming from me this
23:36 - idea that we need to make our lives
23:38 - difficult at times
23:40 - and this is not something that any one
23:42 - of us can tell the other person because
23:44 - we need to be honest enough that we
23:45 - notice and see where we have struggle
23:48 - what we can't do well enough in order to
23:50 - then decide we don't use tools for these
23:52 - things but we understand the technology
23:55 - and we understand how to really do it on
23:57 - ourselves
23:58 - and for me as an example
24:00 - i like to focus one of my
24:02 - the areas that i like to focus on a lot
24:04 - is maintenance and maintainability
24:06 - and i intentionally
24:08 - i'm not a masochist well not
24:11 - sometimes maybe
24:12 - but for some projects i don't use a
24:15 - condom management system nor aesthetic
24:16 - side generator or anything like that i
24:19 - maintain it manually and i have one side
24:21 - i think very small fortunately
24:23 - thankfully 38 languages
24:25 - and i maintain it all by hand and this
24:28 - is painful but it is painful in a good
24:30 - way because when i notice that i up
24:34 - then
24:35 - okay i learned something
24:37 - there's not a script running in the
24:39 - background then compiles it or i have
24:40 - just one piece where i change it now i
24:42 - intentionally made it a bit harder for
24:44 - myself so that i know when i screw
24:46 - something up that i feel the pain
24:48 - so that it's not a tool remedying or
24:51 - like that i never noticed that i screw
24:52 - up in the first place or worse in a team
24:54 - environment that somebody up else cleans
24:56 - up the stuff that i've
24:58 - i've done
25:01 - and this is an example for that so where
25:02 - we
25:03 - intentionally make our lives more
25:05 - difficult where we focus on practice
25:08 - where we focus on actually really
25:10 - understanding and mastering our craft
25:15 - also thing that i've not not even
25:17 - alluded to
25:19 - but you can see that clearly i think in
25:20 - the power camp
25:22 - our industry and our field allow us to
25:24 - work alone
25:26 - you can work freelance and self-employed
25:28 - and you can even as a consultant i think
25:29 - you can spend a lot of time alone
25:32 - and then worse
25:33 - and i i really like i don't want to make
25:35 - this a topic here but i think there are
25:37 - some problems around that worse we
25:39 - romanticize and we glorify this idea of
25:42 - the digital and the global nomad
25:44 - you can just work anywhere just go to
25:46 - the caribbean and handle your client
25:48 - projects we say this is like great this
25:51 - is an ideal this is like the ideal
25:53 - worker these days and i'm exaggerating
25:56 - again just for the emphasis
25:58 - but there are problems to that
25:59 - and i'm not talking about like
26:02 - what this really does with you like
26:04 - whether it's really that favorable and
26:06 - desirable to leave you all your friends
26:07 - and family
26:08 - but the thing is when we work alone on
26:10 - stuff and when we work alone on stuff
26:12 - for an extended period of time there is
26:15 - a chance
26:16 - that we
26:17 - forego any kind of criticism
26:20 - and criticism in the sense of scrutiny
26:22 - not in a sense of negative feedback by
26:24 - all means just scrutiny and we know that
26:26 - pair programming peer reviews code
26:28 - reviews are useful for that reason just
26:30 - so that we
26:31 - have an eye on each other like that we
26:33 - can check like is there something that
26:35 - we can do better or is there something
26:36 - obviously wrong or something like that
26:39 - up to the point where we outright escape
26:41 - reality
26:43 - and that probably sounds good i don't
26:45 - really have a good example for that
26:47 - but i guess you can really push it very
26:48 - far
26:49 - and so it's something that we need to
26:51 - watch out for
26:52 - uh that when we work alone this is an
26:54 - option that we have it comes as a perk
26:57 - of our field
26:59 - and we will see at a later point then
27:01 - too like how it is actually also very
27:03 - tempting to do that but how is something
27:05 - we need to watch out for
27:07 - that we need to guard ourselves against
27:10 - and then
27:11 - the power in general and this guy
27:14 - having no limits
27:16 - and actually there should probably say
27:17 - we obviously have
27:19 - touched on the point of choice where you
27:21 - can work alone in freelance where you
27:23 - can hire with agencies or multinationals
27:25 - or
27:26 - you can try a lot of things in our field
27:28 - up to founding companies and we see
27:30 - great examples for
27:31 - companies in even like in web design and
27:34 - development if i think about jimdo in
27:36 - germany for instance or wix in the us
27:38 - for instance companies that of course
27:39 - like target
27:40 - like
27:42 - people like who want to run websites and
27:43 - we are in that business and so on i find
27:45 - these are interesting examples for
27:48 - companies that are
27:49 - successful
27:50 - i think they actually had their ups and
27:52 - downs
27:53 - but as examples for where we can push a
27:55 - very development and the design-centric
27:59 - idea of our profession
28:00 - and so what happens there is and i don't
28:03 - necessarily see that and observe that
28:05 - that much when it comes to career
28:06 - choices that people are literally
28:08 - waiting for months to decide whether
28:10 - they want to work freelance or whether
28:11 - they want to work for a company but we
28:13 - see this i think in technology and tool
28:15 - choices and then also when work when
28:17 - people when we work on our own projects
28:20 - that we lose focus
28:22 - that it's that with its power that we
28:24 - can't do anything leads to that we
28:26 - actually do anything
28:27 - and that is problematic and with that
28:29 - comes some sense of inertia too that
28:31 - sometimes we get a bit slower because
28:34 - first we need to evaluate this and that
28:35 - and maybe
28:36 - how do we
28:38 - choose and and and things like that so
28:40 - there are effects of this
28:42 - and then in the next aspect
28:44 - the complexity of our field now now we
28:47 - get to some of the drawbacks
28:50 - that it's got really obscure now what's
28:53 - right or wrong and in the technical
28:55 - realm as we know there often is right or
28:57 - wrong
28:58 - sometimes there isn't there are good
29:00 - number of questions and i think we are
29:01 - then venturing more in design and
29:03 - usability and preferences and so on you
29:05 - don't have a right or wrong but for some
29:07 - technical questions you can clearly say
29:09 - something performs or works better than
29:11 - the other
29:12 - but it's gotten really really difficult
29:14 - now to tell when that is the case and i
29:16 - would venture to say that this
29:18 - affects us as experts as professionals
29:20 - just as much as anyone else like whether
29:23 - we're junior or more expert or more
29:25 - senior
29:26 - and i think there are two reasons for
29:28 - that one thing is like something i think
29:30 - we all struggle with in a way and that
29:32 - is probably the simpler reason that it's
29:34 - really hard to tell like who is an
29:35 - expert
29:37 - how do we judge that is that like that
29:39 - person has published something or worked
29:41 - for a company or has written this
29:43 - project or like what is it how do we
29:46 - tell like whether a person like really
29:47 - has a point somewhere and maybe we find
29:50 - out we can't really tell that because we
29:51 - can all make mistakes and of course on
29:54 - the other side of the spectrum
29:56 - there are good points that junior
29:57 - developers and junior members of our
29:59 - field do or do make
30:01 - so we sometimes get feedback from people
30:03 - who aren't really long in our field and
30:04 - they can make excellent remarks and
30:06 - point us to things that we have
30:07 - completely overlooked so the expertise
30:10 - thing is one thing the other thing then
30:12 - and i will try to not make this too
30:14 - academic because i don't think that
30:15 - would help us that much but there is a
30:18 - problem in the way we argue
30:20 - and i will give an example also out of a
30:23 - field or an area dear to me and that's
30:25 - frameworks development
30:27 - and you can perfectly imagine a person a
30:29 - saying
30:30 - hey yes absolutely use a frame always
30:33 - because
30:34 - you can quickly get something out of the
30:37 - ground you can quickly work your project
30:39 - and quickly see whether this is working
30:41 - or not proof of concept and then you get
30:43 - a person like me who says oh my gosh
30:48 - please do not use the framework
30:50 - because sooner or later you want and
30:51 - what you want to tailor
30:53 - a framework an external framework can
30:55 - never know what you intend to do with
30:57 - your site so it comes with too much code
31:00 - if it comes more often than enough it
31:02 - comes with too much code then too little
31:03 - because obviously you pick the stuff
31:05 - that covers your needs but it will
31:06 - always cover more than those
31:08 - so it has
31:10 - bloat in there it's thus it's not
31:12 - efficient as
31:13 - does it has therefore brings performance
31:15 - issues and there are also security
31:17 - problems with that if you're always
31:19 - continuously hooking up to third-party
31:20 - services or servers or something like
31:22 - that or always need to watch for a third
31:24 - party
31:26 - now you have these two
31:28 - persons
31:30 - and they tell you something
31:31 - contradictory one says don't use them
31:34 - yeah that says do use them
31:37 - and of course like we already see what's
31:39 - the problem here because the premises
31:42 - and the goals are different the person
31:44 - like favoring and advocating frameworks
31:47 - and let it be something else too like
31:49 - could be libraries or something like
31:50 - that it's really saying like here speed
31:51 - of execution is important and proof of
31:54 - concept
31:55 - and the other person says like no
31:56 - quality is important and security so
31:59 - premises are different
32:01 - the next thing there is like we need to
32:04 - i guess like this is fairly easy to
32:05 - follow but it is something that we need
32:07 - to keep in mind both as recipients when
32:10 - we follow arguments
32:11 - and then also as the ones bringing them
32:14 - forth when we write
32:16 - we need to be clear
32:17 - that
32:18 - they're
32:20 - that it's important that we make clear
32:21 - the premises of our arguments what are
32:23 - we after and then we can still run into
32:26 - situations where you read five that we
32:28 - get five different expert opinions they
32:31 - are all different and they are all right
32:34 - and then you have other aspects where of
32:35 - course like you have several people you
32:37 - they all give you some answers and
32:39 - they're all wrong and it's just gotten
32:41 - difficult to tell and i think we
32:44 - perhaps just need to acknowledge that
32:46 - it's gotten really hard now and that we
32:48 - stay careful when it comes to judging
32:50 - solutions and judging commentary and
32:52 - judging our views because of exactly the
32:55 - situation so it's important that we keep
32:57 - in mind that we argue properly and i
32:59 - don't think like since this is really
33:01 - something you can dive in academically
33:03 - where it's about like the logical
33:05 - construction of arguments that this is
33:07 - probably not a problem that goes away
33:08 - that soon not in the landscape that
33:09 - we're in right now where we face that
33:11 - ton of complexity the different
33:13 - technologies the different tools the
33:14 - different philosophies the different
33:16 - approaches the different mindsets etc
33:20 - and then the fifth point i want to make
33:21 - here where we put everything on fire is
33:24 - that instant publishing
33:26 - as nice as it is as it is to get a kick
33:29 - out of publishing something on our
33:30 - website the kick we get out of
33:32 - publishing an article for magazine the
33:34 - kick that we get from publishing our
33:36 - first book or the second or whatever
33:39 - that this is also something to guard
33:41 - against because yes we probably get some
33:43 - reviews then at later stages it seeming
33:46 - it must make some sense what we're
33:48 - saying and what we're doing
33:50 - and
33:51 - yeah probably something useful in there
33:54 - but it is
33:55 - a problem too because we get this
33:57 - gratification
33:59 - we get this kick
34:00 - but it is also a danger that it it
34:05 - messes with us in a way that we think
34:07 - like there is something more to our work
34:09 - that we are somewhat special and this i
34:11 - want to use to actually quickly jump to
34:14 - the next points where we try to get
34:16 - ourselves out of this situation and i
34:18 - can already say i don't have five points
34:20 - again
34:21 - only three more
34:23 - and they're also not exact matches to
34:25 - what i've just described
34:28 - we've seen i hope
34:30 - that our field
34:32 - and our neighboring fields are really
34:34 - special
34:37 - and i think they really are
34:40 - but the thing is
34:41 - we're
34:42 - not
34:44 - and it's funny because i do not want to
34:45 - make this a hobby psychologist thing
34:48 - and i don't
34:49 - believe much in this idea that we say oh
34:51 - no we are all special and then we're not
34:53 - again or something like that and then we
34:54 - get into some i don't know where you end
34:56 - up then but this is
34:58 - where this is going when you start
34:59 - arguing this way of course we are
35:02 - valuable and we are people and
35:03 - everything
35:04 - but our field gives us unique
35:08 - opportunities
35:10 - very unique advantages
35:13 - but it's not that this makes like
35:15 - special in the sense that we are also
35:16 - entitled
35:17 - and i think entitlement
35:19 - these days
35:20 - is a really important thing to keep in
35:23 - mind
35:24 - and i need to
35:25 - caution myself now not to again like get
35:28 - on this track of hobby psychology here
35:31 - but there are these indications and
35:33 - these ideas that whenever we look around
35:35 - in society people for actually very
35:38 - for quite opposite reasons actually the
35:40 - people who are doing really really well
35:42 - seem to feel really entitled about
35:44 - everything needs special treatment and
35:46 - then we also have people that would do
35:47 - really really bad poorly
35:49 - and they also feel entitled and they
35:51 - also feel they need special treatment
35:52 - and we have that and i want to stop my
35:54 - commentary on that there because what do
35:56 - i know but the thing is
35:59 - it is something that i think affects us
36:00 - too
36:01 - there are unique options and
36:03 - opportunities in our field unique powers
36:06 - that come with it
36:09 - okay
36:10 - let's just be grateful for this
36:13 - the other thing that i think we can look
36:15 - at more closely is focus
36:17 - and i want to start with a little story
36:19 - there
36:20 - i picked up a book by gary keller last
36:22 - year it's called the one thing i think
36:24 - is also pretty popular and i read this
36:26 - book and i'm like ah okay awesome
36:29 - focus and the idea is really like you
36:31 - pick in your work life and in your
36:33 - personal life etc maybe also for your
36:36 - day you pick your one thing that you
36:37 - want to focus on the basic the essence
36:39 - of the book is pretty simple
36:42 - so what does jen's do
36:44 - i sit down
36:45 - and open up a spreadsheet and as a
36:48 - self-employed person working on my own
36:50 - stuff i'm like i'm listing all the
36:52 - different things that i'm doing i come
36:54 - up with this list of 50 items
36:56 - i say yes okay yeah focus and i was
36:59 - marking through and axing out like these
37:00 - things that weren't important or fun
37:02 - like yeah they're not important ended up
37:04 - with a list of 45 items
37:08 - that is not focus
37:10 - and it took me actually a major personal
37:12 - earthquake earlier this year where
37:14 - things were pretty shitty
37:16 - and i was like i don't really work on
37:18 - stuff right now but for some reason i
37:20 - need to like i need to do some things
37:23 - and i was looking at the different
37:24 - things that i was doing and thinking
37:26 - about them and also like feeling a bit
37:27 - more like where's my heart at because i
37:29 - was trying all sorts of
37:31 - and stuff
37:32 - and projects here and there because when
37:34 - you're self-employed and when you really
37:35 - look into making a living and we again
37:38 - we have these options right we can focus
37:40 - on content size affiliate marketing
37:42 - there are people making thousands of
37:43 - euros with that so why not do these test
37:45 - balloons and as looking at it
37:48 - and end up with two or three things
37:50 - i was like okay yeah that
37:52 - okay but didn't set out to
37:54 - get through a major crisis but at least
37:57 - i'm focused now
37:58 - and i do not wish this to anyone else
38:00 - here
38:01 - that is necessary or and i want to
38:03 - suggest that it's important for us to go
38:05 - through any kind of crisis in order to
38:07 - get there
38:08 - but i do believe and i strongly believe
38:10 - that it is important for us to focus
38:12 - that we are aware of where are our
38:14 - priorities and by the way things get of
38:17 - course as always they depend they get
38:19 - more subtle
38:20 - for instance if you are a junior
38:23 - developer or designer or member of our
38:25 - field
38:26 - it does make sense to try things to cast
38:29 - a wider net
38:30 - try things don't be too focused just
38:34 - look at everything but the ones for
38:36 - us more senior here
38:38 - i think it is important
38:41 - that we focus that we know what is
38:42 - really important what are the projects
38:44 - we need to look at what are the
38:46 - technologies you want to be really good
38:48 - at so what is it that really matters and
38:51 - where is our heart at
38:53 - i think this is really crucial
38:56 - and then lastly this is odd thing too
38:58 - and i will try to explain this just a
39:00 - bit because we've already talked about
39:02 - working alone and stuff like that and
39:03 - then also what
39:05 - the options that we have on our field
39:07 - like do with us
39:09 - and for me
39:14 - try to think whether this is such a
39:15 - useful start but i'll try it this way
39:19 - in my time at google
39:21 - and it's a high performance environment
39:24 - never really struggled there it's not to
39:25 - say that i can do all these things that
39:27 - easily no
39:30 - the reason why i didn't struggle
39:32 - and i only noticed this years later
39:34 - was that i had already carved out a
39:36 - niche i have my specializations and i
39:38 - suspect many of you do too you
39:40 - specialize in something
39:43 - and the interesting thing about
39:45 - specialization is it's actually a very
39:47 - smart way of
39:48 - evading escaping competition
39:51 - because when you're a specialist in
39:53 - something
39:54 - and when you work in an environment
39:55 - where it's the only evidence when you're
39:57 - the only person doing this stuff so it
39:59 - doesn't mean that on the on the whole
40:00 - planet you're the only person doing this
40:02 - no but it suffices if in your company or
40:04 - in your team you're the only person
40:05 - doing something you're a specialist
40:08 - and it's harder to compete against you
40:11 - and what i'm saying trying to say is and
40:13 - i need to start another thread here
40:15 - there's an excellent book by alphycon
40:17 - called no contest
40:18 - and not only does he argue
40:20 - [Music]
40:22 - that we as humans aren't inherently
40:25 - competitive but rather the opposite we
40:27 - are cooperative
40:28 - we get where we are and we got where we
40:31 - are through working together through
40:33 - cooperating and i deem it actually
40:35 - really
40:37 - terrible thing when we keep on telling
40:39 - ourselves these stories that we are all
40:41 - competitive and that we would eat
40:43 - ourselves alive and all that stuff i
40:44 - think this is yes
40:47 - we are cooperative so now when you look
40:49 - at it if we assume that we are
40:51 - cooperative
40:53 - and then another point cohn made we are
40:55 - in an environment full of structural
40:58 - competition as he calls it where in
41:00 - education in the workplace in society
41:03 - you have all these circumstances that
41:06 - force you to compete with your fellow
41:10 - beings
41:11 - humans
41:12 - the english leaves media
41:14 - mentioned
41:17 - that's bad news
41:18 - so i mean we all need to be better and
41:22 - we all get we compared and judged and
41:24 - assessed and so on i think this is
41:26 - terrible and for me it was funny like
41:28 - because i noticed like i'm inviting i'm
41:30 - taking on competition i don't mind
41:31 - competing i don't want to but if someone
41:33 - is pushing me i compete
41:35 - but then i think the strategy is nice if
41:37 - you think about yeah you specialize or
41:39 - you work alone on things and so on
41:40 - because yeah you're competing in a way
41:42 - but you're also not
41:44 - and then as we've seen like some other
41:46 - issues come up because you isolate
41:48 - yourself in a professional level and so
41:49 - on you have different issues then
41:52 - so the point that i try to make here is
41:53 - just let
41:55 - let's not fix the world here i have no
41:57 - idea how what we are supposed to do
41:59 - about structural competition in the
42:00 - workplace no idea this is not my cup of
42:03 - tea really but it is important for us i
42:05 - think to be aware of this and to look at
42:07 - it and figure out like
42:09 - okay well maybe it affects us at least
42:11 - acknowledge that
42:13 - closing then
42:15 - i want to
42:16 - really with the what i wanted with it
42:18 - want to do with the opening remarks
42:21 - and with what i've split in here and
42:23 - there that our field
42:25 - web development design and also the
42:28 - neighboring professions are awesome
42:32 - they're fantabulous like it's really fun
42:35 - there are a lot of lots of great things
42:36 - about our fields like the what we learn
42:40 - there the opportunities that we have
42:42 - like the growth path that we see there
42:44 - the many options i think like are
42:46 - fantabulous so that's all i want to
42:49 - really say now
42:50 - and that's why i'm personally also very
42:52 - excited now to see all the other talks
42:55 - and to be here be on telegram now for
42:56 - today and tomorrow thank you
