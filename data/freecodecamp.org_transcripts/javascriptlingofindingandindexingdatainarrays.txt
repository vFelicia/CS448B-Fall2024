00:00 - in this video we're going to talk about
00:01 - indexing arrays how you access a certain
00:04 - piece of information inside of an array

00:09 - it's an array because of the square

00:15 - want to return wook okay that we would
00:19 - count we would say Okay 1 2 3 4 5 6 you
00:23 - think if you did that names six that
00:25 - would return W but that's actually not
00:27 - how it works it starts at zero so so if
00:30 - we said pet names zero like
00:37 - this that would return Maurice if we try
00:40 - to do pet names
00:42 - one that would return Hermione so it's

00:55 - 5 if we had something like return pet
00:58 - names five that would go look
