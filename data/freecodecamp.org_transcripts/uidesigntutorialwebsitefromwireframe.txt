00:00 - if you're looking to design a website
00:03 - there are a number of steps you need to
00:05 - take today we're going to be taking a
00:06 - look at the second step
00:08 - which is creating the ui for the website
00:10 - design
00:11 - we already did the first step which was
00:13 - creating a wireframe
00:15 - and you can check out the video for that
00:17 - in the description below
00:18 - but here's a quick preview where we
00:20 - built out a home page a features page
00:22 - even a responsive version in this video
00:25 - we're going to be looking at
00:26 - creating the ui for these wireframes i
00:29 - want to design
00:30 - something which looks a little bit
00:31 - better is more professional
00:33 - and it's a closer step towards building
00:36 - out a
00:36 - full website design in this stage we're
00:39 - going to create the prototype ui
00:41 - for this wireframe it's not going to
00:43 - involve any colors or images or content
00:46 - it'll more be a version or a next
00:49 - iteration of that wireframe where we're
00:51 - creating it in a design tool like adobe
00:53 - xd
00:54 - or in this case figma i'm going to take
00:56 - you through the whole process of
00:57 - designing this
00:58 - and if you haven't heard of me before
01:00 - i'm adrian from australia
01:02 - i do videos around design and
01:03 - development and you can check out my
01:05 - channel in the description below
01:07 - but without further ado let's just jump
01:09 - straight into it
01:10 - to create our website design we're going
01:13 - to use a design tool called
01:15 - figma and this is very similar to sketch
01:18 - or adobe xd if you've used those in the
01:21 - past
01:21 - it allows you to create a mock-up of the
01:24 - website design on
01:26 - an artboard which actually exists in
01:28 - your web browser so you can use this on
01:30 - windows or mac or anything in general
01:32 - and you can edit this in real time and
01:34 - even collaborate with other people
01:36 - and if you want to sign up it's also
01:38 - free you don't have to pay
01:40 - anything we're going to sign up here
01:41 - with our google account and we're going
01:43 - to create a new board to start our ui
01:46 - design
01:47 - once you've logged in you want to go up
01:49 - here to
01:50 - drafts and hit the little plus sign and
01:53 - this will create a
01:54 - brand new figma file in this case we're
01:57 - going to give it a name
01:59 - so up here where it says untitled we'll
02:01 - call this
02:02 - maybe free code camp website
02:06 - ui and we can start coding this up but
02:09 - we don't need any code we can just use
02:11 - design to do this
02:13 - let's take a look at the different tools
02:15 - that figma provides for us
02:17 - at the top here we've got the selector
02:19 - tool which will be able to move
02:21 - different shapes and
02:22 - items we also have a scaling tool
02:25 - over here we have a frame and the frame
02:27 - is used to create
02:29 - new frames or canvases to create our
02:31 - designs on
02:32 - over here we've got our shapes so these
02:35 - are things like squares and circles and
02:37 - lines and
02:38 - other objects that we might want to do
02:39 - such as images and finally here we've
02:41 - got our custom shapes
02:43 - text and moving the artboard around
02:46 - finally over here we've got our comment
02:49 - section
02:50 - but we're not gonna really use this this
02:51 - is more if you have a group of people
02:54 - and you need to leave
02:55 - markup and notes for others to review
02:57 - for your design
02:59 - let's start off here by selecting the
03:01 - frame tool
03:02 - and on the far right here we've got a
03:04 - number of options we've got designs here
03:06 - for maybe
03:07 - phones or tablets or even desktop if
03:10 - you're doing a design for maybe
03:11 - something like
03:12 - a piece of paper you can do that too in
03:15 - our example we're just going to grab the
03:17 - desktop size over here to design our
03:19 - canvas
03:20 - i'm going to make a small revision to
03:22 - this however
03:23 - for the width here i'm going to do this
03:24 - to 1980 because this is the normal
03:27 - monitor width that you ex essentially
03:30 - usually use when you're doing a website
03:32 - design and the other thing here is the
03:34 - height
03:35 - i'm gonna also make this one nine eight
03:37 - zero and we might also
03:38 - increase this a little bit as we work
03:40 - through it but this gives us our first
03:42 - frame that we can work on and this will
03:44 - be the home page
03:46 - so over here you can see a desktop desk
03:48 - 1. we're going to rename this and we're
03:50 - going to call this home page
03:52 - and this will be our first canvas we can
03:54 - work on
03:55 - now we've got our design that we did
03:57 - before
03:58 - on the ipad when we did the wireframe
04:01 - and what we want to be able to do
04:02 - is replicate that same design in a
04:04 - better sort of
04:06 - mock-up here for this ui design so i'm
04:08 - going to take you through that but
04:10 - before we get started let's
04:11 - open up and have a look at that
04:12 - wireframe to see what we need to build
04:14 - out
04:15 - what's really cool about figma is that
04:17 - we can literally copy paste content
04:19 - straight in there from our computers
04:21 - we can even drag and drop it so here i
04:23 - have the previous
04:24 - wireframe we did and i'm going to copy
04:27 - paste this
04:28 - just here to the left that we can use as
04:30 - a reference and
04:31 - we can see here we build out a home page
04:33 - a features page a contact page
04:35 - and a mobile version if you haven't seen
04:38 - that video i'll link it in the
04:39 - description below
04:40 - but what we're going to do is we're just
04:42 - going to use the home page here as
04:45 - reference and
04:46 - i've got a separate svg just for that
04:48 - which we're going to copy out here to
04:50 - the right
04:51 - and using this reference we'll start
04:52 - building out a ui against this so that
04:55 - we can create
04:56 - something which is visually just a
04:57 - little bit better and more professional
04:59 - as well
05:00 - that we can show off to our client as
05:02 - the second iteration of our design
05:04 - let's begin by dragging our actual svg
05:08 - here
05:08 - into our page and what i want to be able
05:11 - to do
05:12 - is create out each one of these sections
05:15 - but before we do this
05:16 - normally when you're creating a website
05:18 - then you're using a
05:20 - framework for the layout maybe something
05:22 - like bootstrap with rows and columns
05:25 - so let's create a little bit of a grid
05:28 - layout here
05:28 - there's an option here on the far right
05:30 - called grid layout
05:32 - and i'm just going to select one in here
05:34 - it does a default 10 pixel by 10 pixel
05:36 - grid
05:37 - but we want to customize it to be our
05:39 - own so in this case i'm going to select
05:42 - columns
05:42 - and fold columns i'm going to do 12
05:45 - because that's what
05:46 - normal bootstrap uses of course the
05:49 - width for this is a little bit too much
05:51 - so i'm going to reduce it down
05:53 - and we're going to select a gutter of 15
05:55 - pixels
05:56 - and maybe a width of about 80 or 90 here
06:00 - just to represent our columns of course
06:02 - this can change depending on what you're
06:04 - using but this should just get us
06:06 - started the next thing we'll want to do
06:08 - is
06:09 - create here our section for the slider
06:12 - image and i'm going to select the box
06:14 - tool here at the very top
06:16 - left and we're going to drag and pull
06:19 - down to the bottom right here a nice big
06:21 - box this is a little bit too big right
06:23 - now so i'm going to reduce this down to
06:25 - maybe 800 pixels
06:27 - and we're also going to give it a
06:29 - slightly lighter tint
06:31 - so here in the far right in the fill
06:33 - section we're going to change the c4c
06:36 - for
06:36 - hex color to just eee and that should be
06:40 - a lot more visible now
06:42 - the next thing i want to be able to do
06:44 - is have a look at creating a menu
06:47 - and to do this we select this box tool
06:50 - once more
06:51 - and we're just going to drag it and
06:52 - follow our
06:54 - columns here we might not use all the
06:56 - columns we might just use
06:57 - most of them here and we'll give this
06:59 - maybe a height
07:01 - of about 60 pixels so let's update this
07:04 - here on the far right
07:05 - the next thing we're going to do is
07:07 - select the box tool but drop it down
07:09 - and select a circle and for this circle
07:11 - this will be the logo so i'm just going
07:13 - to
07:13 - pull it in here from the top left and
07:16 - this
07:16 - might just pop in here as two columns in
07:19 - width with one column here having a
07:21 - space between our menu
07:23 - and our logo and it'll be another circle
07:26 - in here
07:27 - so we can see that a lot better let's
07:28 - take out the
07:30 - grids here so we can see these items a
07:32 - little bit
07:33 - clearly here we go and we can see we've
07:36 - got our logo and our menu placeholders
07:38 - there
07:39 - for our logo i'm going to select the
07:42 - text tool here
07:43 - and i'm going to type in logo just
07:45 - anywhere here on the page
07:48 - when we zoom in now to maybe say 75
07:52 - let's just do that here at the top right
07:54 - and have a look we can pull this
07:56 - straight here towards our logo and our
07:59 - circle
08:00 - and we'll make this a little bit bigger
08:01 - i'm going to make it 24 pixels maybe
08:04 - even
08:04 - 48 pixels and i'm just going to put this
08:07 - right on top of the circle i'm going to
08:10 - give it a slightly lighter shade so
08:12 - maybe something like
08:13 - 999 and it'll just go over here we can
08:17 - add it in later
08:19 - the other thing i'm going to do is i'm
08:20 - going to group these two items
08:22 - right now this is just called an ellipse
08:24 - and a logo for text
08:26 - but i'm going to select both of them and
08:28 - hit ctrl g
08:29 - and this will now be a group and for
08:31 - this group i'm going to label it logo
08:32 - just so that we can be able to use this
08:34 - later on
08:35 - if we do we can always expand it out
08:37 - here on the left or
08:38 - double click on it to access the items
08:41 - inside
08:42 - now for the menu i want to be able to do
08:44 - the same thing
08:45 - so what i'm going to do is grab the text
08:48 - item here
08:49 - and i'm going to put in a few different
08:52 - pages
08:52 - since we know which pages we want to use
08:54 - it'll be
08:55 - pretty easy we've got the home page
08:58 - which we've already built
08:59 - we'll have an about us page we'll also
09:02 - have a
09:03 - features page and maybe we'll have
09:06 - a contact us page let's
09:10 - create one more item in here and
09:12 - normally the
09:13 - final item we might have is something
09:15 - like pricing
09:16 - or maybe purchase and this is usually
09:20 - on most websites just so that it takes
09:22 - us to where we need to go
09:24 - now that we have all the menus done
09:27 - all we need to do is space them out
09:29 - equally
09:30 - because right now they sort of don't
09:32 - have the correct amount of spacing
09:34 - there's a few ways we can do this we can
09:36 - pull one of the items from the very
09:38 - left here and we can do one two three
09:41 - four
09:41 - which is 40 pixels from the left then we
09:44 - can apply the same
09:46 - to the boundary so we'll do one two
09:47 - three four here
09:49 - but since this is padding from the left
09:51 - here we'll do another one two three four
09:53 - so that should be about 80 pixels then
09:56 - when we do the next unit over here we
09:58 - should be able to apply the
10:00 - same amount of padding figma actually
10:02 - has some tools here that
10:04 - automatically tell you how much padding
10:06 - is applied
10:07 - so here we had 82 so i'm just gonna
10:09 - reduce that by two pixels for both of
10:12 - these
10:13 - and that should be just about right so
10:15 - if we have a look now it's 80 and 80.
10:18 - let's move this down as well so it's on
10:20 - the same line height
10:22 - and we can then browse over here to the
10:25 - purchase one
10:26 - also put in 80 pixels so here is 80
10:29 - here let's double check that's 80 as
10:32 - well it doesn't seem to be 80
10:34 - let's have a look 79
10:37 - 80 80 and this one over here will be 80
10:41 - as well
10:42 - then we can move this menu in just a
10:45 - little bit
10:46 - so this should be about 80 pixels as
10:48 - well from the far right
10:50 - and finally we want to highlight our
10:52 - active item which is the home page
10:54 - so i'm going to copy over this box and
10:56 - i'm just going to create another one on
10:58 - top here
10:58 - and this one will have a darker shade so
11:00 - maybe something like 666
11:03 - and we're going to invert the color here
11:06 - for the home
11:07 - so that'll be white on dark gray
11:10 - now with that done we have our menu more
11:13 - or less complete
11:14 - we can reduce the height a little bit so
11:16 - instead of 80 we could
11:18 - push it down to maybe 60. let's actually
11:20 - move it down
11:21 - just a tad here we can see that it's
11:24 - fitting in quite nicely there
11:26 - the next thing we can do is have a look
11:28 - at creating our slider here
11:30 - because right now it doesn't look like
11:31 - much of a slider so in order to do that
11:34 - what i'm thinking is maybe
11:36 - create a couple of those arrows here on
11:38 - the left and the right
11:40 - now there's a few different ways we can
11:41 - do this we could go to font awesome for
11:44 - example
11:45 - we go chevron left here and this
11:48 - is a icon here we can use from font
11:50 - awesome we can
11:51 - actually download the svg in here when
11:54 - we do we can
11:55 - literally drag and drop it straight into
11:58 - our design over here
11:59 - right now it's a little bit too big so
12:01 - i'm going to resize it down just a tad
12:03 - maybe down to about say let's see
12:07 - we'll look in the resizing tool here and
12:09 - i think for the width i'm going to do
12:11 - 40 pixels and the height can stay at 64.
12:14 - and that's just about right and we're
12:16 - just going to center this here
12:18 - to our slider we'll also give it about
12:21 - a 40 units there from the left and we'll
12:24 - also
12:25 - reduce its color so here on the right
12:27 - i'm going to give it a 50
12:29 - opacity just so that it's not fully
12:32 - black
12:32 - we could even reduce this down a little
12:34 - bit more maybe at 33
12:36 - and that's just enough to give it a bit
12:38 - of a gray tint but it'll also blend into
12:40 - the background later if we add an image
12:42 - in here
12:43 - we can copy over this same chevron and
12:46 - place one here to the far right
12:48 - i'll give this another 40 pixels and
12:51 - i'll also rotate it so it's pointing to
12:53 - the right side
12:54 - and finally we might add a few little
12:57 - dots here to the bottom of our slider
12:59 - which might be about 22 pixels in width
13:02 - and height
13:03 - and we'll copy them over just so that
13:05 - they can represent the slides themselves
13:08 - and which one is the current active one
13:10 - so let's
13:11 - do that just over here and we can give
13:14 - them about
13:15 - 10 pixels of space in between
13:19 - and with that done i'll also color in
13:22 - the very
13:23 - primary one here with that dark gray
13:25 - tint
13:26 - so that's our slider done for our home
13:28 - page it's also our logo
13:30 - and our menu done and this looks pretty
13:33 - accurate
13:34 - comparing with our slider image the only
13:36 - other thing we could do in here is maybe
13:38 - some hero text
13:39 - so in here i'll just put in hero title
13:42 - and i'm going to give it a slightly
13:43 - larger font size
13:45 - maybe like 72 pixels will be just about
13:48 - right
13:49 - and maybe a heavier weight at maybe bold
13:52 - hero title example can be our primary
13:55 - text here
13:56 - if we open up the
13:59 - the frame here with the columns and make
14:01 - that visible we can make sure it's
14:02 - aligned properly here to the left
14:05 - and i'm going to copy this over and make
14:07 - a smaller
14:08 - one here and this one i'll give it a
14:11 - regular weight
14:12 - and this can be a hero sub
14:16 - title description
14:20 - beautiful we'll also give this a
14:22 - slightly
14:23 - uh slight opacity at maybe 66 percent
14:27 - and we can turn off the grids over here
14:31 - now so we can take a look at that
14:33 - and in terms of a slider this is pretty
14:35 - good i'm pretty happy with this hero
14:37 - banner slider and navigation
14:39 - we can take a look at creating the next
14:41 - section in our design here
14:43 - and the next section if we take a look
14:45 - at it it's actually doing the about us
14:47 - section where we've got an image on the
14:49 - left we've got a title
14:50 - a description and a button and this
14:52 - should be pretty easy to do
14:54 - using our column design so let me pull
14:56 - this in here to the
14:57 - right so we can start working on it so
15:01 - i'm going to copy over this entire
15:03 - section that we had here for our hero
15:06 - and create this one with a slightly
15:09 - lighter tint maybe something like f1 f1
15:12 - f1
15:13 - this way we can see that we do have a
15:16 - height to it
15:17 - but we're going to work within the
15:18 - bounds of that height just so that we
15:20 - don't make
15:21 - anything too large or too small but it's
15:23 - consistent with all the other sections
15:25 - what we want to be able to do
15:27 - is open up our rows here and for our
15:30 - rows i want to be able to see them
15:33 - and i want to work within the bounds of
15:35 - them and by rows i of course mean
15:37 - columns but
15:39 - you get the idea what we're going to do
15:41 - is we're going to create a
15:42 - square here to represent the image and
15:45 - this will span about
15:46 - 4 columns i'm just going to center this
15:49 - inside this section right over here and
15:52 - the next thing i'm going to do is
15:54 - create a description section where i'm
15:56 - copying out the hero description
15:58 - and pasting it just here on the right
16:01 - with maybe a
16:02 - one column gap i'm going to
16:05 - bump this height up a little bit so that
16:08 - it's got less margin between the title
16:10 - and the description and i'm also going
16:12 - to copy out this description
16:14 - create another one here which might be
16:16 - 24 pixels in
16:18 - width or font size anyway and we're
16:21 - gonna expand
16:22 - out this section let's jump in on the
16:24 - lorem ipsum website here
16:26 - and let's copy over our favorite bit of
16:29 - text
16:30 - we're gonna paste it here in the
16:32 - description and anyone who wants to
16:34 - can edit this in the future but it gets
16:37 - our description up and running
16:39 - i don't want so much content so i'll
16:41 - remove some of it
16:42 - but below here if we take a look we are
16:45 - almost
16:45 - getting the design the same here as our
16:48 - wireframe
16:49 - what we need though is a button so i'm
16:51 - going to copy over this image
16:53 - i'm going to pull it here over to the
16:54 - right and i'm going to give it a height
16:57 - of about the same as the menu which was
16:59 - 60.
17:00 - we're going to reduce the width a little
17:02 - bit here and we're going to
17:04 - add some text here to put on top of the
17:06 - button
17:08 - here we go and in this case i'm going to
17:11 - do something like
17:12 - read more this is pretty standard the
17:14 - only other thing i might do here
17:16 - is bump up the text just a little bit to
17:18 - maybe
17:20 - 28 28 does just about right
17:23 - let's resize the text sizing box over
17:27 - here
17:27 - and let's also center this read more
17:30 - section
17:31 - this button here i feel like it'll do a
17:33 - lot better if it's a darker shade
17:35 - so i'm going to make it a 666 with the
17:38 - color for the readme being a white color
17:41 - and that way you can stand out just a
17:43 - little bit more
17:44 - so that way we've got this section done
17:46 - here and it's starting to look pretty
17:47 - good
17:48 - i'm pretty happy with it so far and i
17:51 - don't think we need anything else it
17:53 - gets us started for this introduction
17:55 - section
17:56 - i only think that the title here for the
17:58 - hero is a little bit too large because
18:00 - we've already used this
18:02 - large size on the hero image so what i'm
18:04 - going to do is i'm going to
18:05 - bump this down just one lot of units to
18:08 - maybe
18:08 - 64 pixels or maybe even 48 pixels
18:12 - 48 might be a little bit too low so i'm
18:15 - going to reduce it down to
18:17 - say 60 and this one over here maybe to
18:20 - 36.
18:22 - that way they don't look a little bit
18:23 - too overwhelming they still fit within
18:26 - the confines of this section
18:28 - but they don't overwhelm you similar to
18:30 - how the hero section is
18:31 - meant to be a lot larger now let's
18:35 - take a look at this section without any
18:37 - grids
18:38 - implemented i'm gonna re turn them off
18:41 - over
18:42 - here and i'm also going to take off this
18:45 - gray color for the background of this
18:47 - section and we can see
18:48 - that it's looking pretty good if we
18:52 - take a look at our original version here
18:54 - we can see that we
18:55 - have quite a bit of padding here from
18:57 - the top to the bottom that's almost 200
19:00 - pixels
19:00 - but we can reduce that in the future
19:02 - it's more about keeping this section
19:04 - similar i'm going to copy over this
19:07 - section but
19:08 - before i do we should really have a look
19:11 - at
19:12 - how we're doing the grouping on the left
19:14 - here because right now it's a big
19:16 - mess and we don't know what anything is
19:18 - so what i'm going to do is grab the
19:20 - common items in this section by shift
19:23 - selecting them and i'm going to group
19:25 - them with ctrl g
19:27 - and in here i'm going to do about us
19:30 - section
19:31 - this will be a clear indication of what
19:33 - this section is because right now we're
19:35 - not too sure
19:36 - in here we can give some more labels as
19:38 - well so this might be the
19:40 - image over here for the readme i'm going
19:43 - to group that as well
19:45 - and we'll do this as read me button
19:48 - and then finally we've got one more
19:50 - rectangle here and we'll call this bg
19:53 - in case we do want to add a background
19:54 - later if you're feeling particularly
19:58 - ambitious you can also reorder these
20:00 - things so they make sense
20:02 - logically so for example the title might
20:05 - go first the description second
20:07 - the text and the button last with image
20:09 - here being
20:10 - first being on the left of these columns
20:14 - and that's our section done here the
20:16 - other thing we can do is actually
20:17 - lock it into place so that way we can't
20:20 - select it or move it about anymore
20:22 - this will be a good idea to do as well
20:24 - here for this
20:25 - main hero section so i'm going to grab a
20:28 - lot of these elements here
20:29 - so that we can group them all together
20:32 - that way
20:33 - they can exist as they need to so we'll
20:35 - call this
20:36 - hero section the other thing we have to
20:38 - do is the same here for the menu
20:41 - so i'm going to group these and call
20:42 - this menu and we'll pull this
20:44 - up above our hero section and we could
20:47 - even pull
20:48 - it inside the hero section but normally
20:51 - since we'll be using this
20:52 - menu outside for other pages it might be
20:54 - useful just to have it outside
20:56 - the same goes here for the logo so i'm
20:58 - going to pull that outside as well
21:01 - that covers most of our section here for
21:03 - the hero
21:04 - and for the about us section so let's
21:06 - actually lock these into place so we can
21:08 - begin working on the next section
21:10 - i'm also going to increase the height of
21:13 - the home page here
21:14 - to 250 or 2600 pixels
21:19 - and this will give us room to create the
21:21 - section here for the sponsors
21:24 - so what i'm gonna do is copy our about
21:26 - us section
21:27 - and i'm gonna drag it in here below but
21:30 - i'm gonna make a few changes to it
21:33 - so over here if we have our button for
21:36 - readme
21:37 - i'm going to take that out the one here
21:41 - for the description i'm gonna also
21:42 - remove that
21:44 - we'll only be left with the hero title
21:46 - and subtitle
21:48 - i'm also going to put this up all the
21:50 - way to the top of this section
21:52 - and i'm going to try and center these so
21:55 - that they exist
21:56 - right in the middle of our page if we
21:58 - move it across we should
22:00 - have figma essentially tell us by a red
22:03 - border when it's ready there
22:05 - finally i'm going to enable our columns
22:08 - here again so that we can see them
22:10 - and this image that we have here for our
22:13 - design we're going to shrink this down
22:15 - to be essentially
22:16 - two columns in width and we're going to
22:19 - copy this across so let's actually copy
22:22 - this in here
22:23 - and i'll keep copying this across until
22:25 - it spans
22:26 - all of our row here
22:29 - and these will be our sponsors now you
22:32 - can see that we've
22:33 - fit most of them in here and i think
22:35 - that's pretty good
22:36 - the only other thing i want to do with
22:38 - this section is possibly
22:40 - give it a slight background tin i'm
22:43 - going to grab the same tint we used here
22:45 - for our header
22:46 - but now that we have applied a bit of a
22:47 - tin we are going to have to expand it
22:50 - out just a little bit
22:51 - so that the title section there has the
22:54 - same sort of height
22:56 - as it does in the other section so i
22:58 - think that's about 200 pixels
23:00 - let's move all of these down and that's
23:03 - looking a little bit better there
23:05 - since this isn't a hero title example
23:07 - this is about
23:10 - us i'm going to rename all this rename
23:12 - this to about us example
23:14 - and about a subtitle
23:17 - for this section here i'm going to do
23:19 - this as the sponsors
23:21 - example and the sponsor's
23:24 - description let's center this and
23:28 - since this is a line left in terms of
23:31 - text there's a tool here that
23:32 - gets us to a line at center so i'm going
23:35 - to apply this both
23:36 - to the title and the subtitle and i'm
23:38 - going to move them again into the center
23:40 - so that they're working properly
23:42 - and that should be just about there
23:46 - we also want this to have a little bit
23:48 - less padding
23:50 - from the bottom there so i'm thinking
23:51 - just about 200 pixels
23:57 - and that's just about right but it feels
24:00 - like it's too
24:01 - many pixels i'm gonna maybe make it only
24:04 - a hundred
24:04 - and that's about a hundred there so
24:07 - that's
24:08 - pretty good there for our sponsor
24:09 - section i'm just gonna move the images
24:11 - up
24:12 - just a tiny bit i'm gonna redo how
24:15 - centered this is so that it just does
24:17 - look centered so
24:19 - that's all done and we can move on to
24:23 - our final section which is actually our
24:25 - footer so we're almost done for this
24:27 - design
24:27 - and it's starting to come out pretty
24:29 - good let's
24:30 - remove the columns over here to have a
24:32 - look at the sponsors section
24:35 - and the thing about this is that if we
24:37 - take a look at the about us section
24:39 - it's got about 200 pixels of padding
24:42 - there from the bottom and the top
24:43 - but for this sponsor section it's only
24:46 - about 100 pixels
24:48 - and this is because there's less content
24:50 - so it's got a bit
24:52 - less room to breathe there simply
24:54 - because it's not overwhelming with
24:56 - content the more content you normally
24:57 - put into a design
24:59 - the more padding you want to make sure
25:01 - that you're adding in so that everything
25:03 - stays consistent
25:04 - in here i just want to make sure it's
25:06 - just about 100 pixels so that's looking
25:08 - good
25:10 - now for the footer a footer design it
25:12 - normally has a much darker
25:14 - tint to it so what i'm going to do is
25:16 - i'm going to copy over this
25:17 - home box that we created earlier i'm
25:20 - going to use this as the baseline for
25:22 - our footer
25:22 - over here so let's actually cut and
25:25 - paste this in here below
25:26 - i'm also going to make it a little bit
25:29 - bigger here so i'm going to expand this
25:31 - out just here to the bottom and that
25:34 - should get our footer section ready
25:36 - now if we take a look here in our
25:38 - wireframe we're using a logo
25:41 - a contact form and a site map
25:44 - since we already have a logo here i'm
25:46 - gonna actually copy this across and
25:48 - we're gonna paste it here below
25:50 - we can see that that automatically looks
25:53 - okay
25:54 - the next thing i want to do is this
25:56 - rectangle i'm just going to
25:57 - group it in its own section here and
25:59 - i'll call this footerbg
26:01 - for the time being and the logo i'm just
26:04 - going to move in here
26:05 - and we're going to group this whole
26:06 - thing as footer
26:08 - for this section i want to open up the
26:11 - columns here again so we can see what
26:13 - we're working with
26:15 - and we want to design something around
26:17 - these columns so if we
26:19 - take a look at the actual svg here
26:22 - that we created before and how it's
26:25 - designed we can see
26:26 - that we have the three columns here so
26:29 - the first one will take up four columns
26:33 - the next one will take up another four
26:36 - columns so let's
26:37 - let's do that over here i'm just going
26:39 - to block them out so i can see
26:41 - how much space they're taking up and
26:45 - there we go
26:46 - so those are the columns we'll be using
26:49 - so in here i want to
26:50 - put my first title so i'm just going to
26:53 - apply that possibly let's move the logo
26:56 - here to the left
26:57 - and let's put in these titles so for the
27:00 - title here
27:01 - i might copy over this large text that
27:03 - we use for our sponsors and just
27:05 - drag it in below we'll move it up here
27:07 - into the group
27:08 - but instead of being a black color i'm
27:10 - going to make it a
27:11 - white color just so that we can see it
27:13 - properly so
27:14 - here i'm just going to select white and
27:17 - for the description here i'm going to
27:18 - set that to white as well
27:20 - i'm going to pull this in over to the
27:22 - left so it's aligned left and i'm also
27:24 - going to give it some padding here from
27:26 - the top
27:28 - and this is about 10 pixels worth of
27:31 - padding and i think
27:32 - that sorry 100 pixels worth of padding
27:34 - which i think should be just enough
27:36 - here i'm gonna write in contact us and
27:39 - let's just set this to be a line left
27:41 - and we'll move this back over here to
27:43 - the left
27:45 - and here i can write something like send
27:47 - us a
27:48 - message i'll also align this to the left
27:51 - here and we'll make sure that it just
27:53 - starts off here near the column
27:55 - so that's looking good the next part
27:57 - that i want to do
27:58 - is copying this over and creating a bit
28:01 - of a
28:02 - site map so here i'm just going to type
28:04 - in sitemap
28:06 - and all our pages
28:09 - and finally we've got our logo over here
28:12 - we do also want some
28:13 - contact information below our logo i'm
28:16 - just going to copy over this
28:18 - subtitle text and in here we're going to
28:21 - put in a phone number
28:22 - in this case i'm just going to make one
28:24 - up but that should get
28:26 - us up and running the only other thing
28:29 - that we have in here
28:30 - is actually a little icon there for the
28:33 - phone
28:33 - so i'm going to jump into font awesome
28:35 - to get that
28:37 - over here i'm just going to type in
28:39 - phone on their website
28:41 - and it should pop up with a few icons
28:43 - here i'm just going to grab the very
28:45 - first one to download
28:47 - and i'm going to just drag and drop that
28:49 - in we'll set the color here to be white
28:51 - and i'm just going to resize it down
28:53 - here to
28:54 - about 36 pixels and we'll just align
28:57 - that
28:58 - just to the left of our column here we
29:00 - can pull in the phone number just a bit
29:03 - and that looks good we can then copy
29:06 - this
29:06 - across and we can do another one here
29:08 - and the second one might be the email
29:10 - address
29:11 - so here i'll type in email at
29:13 - address.com
29:14 - and we can fill that in later but we'll
29:17 - probably want an icon for that too
29:19 - so over here let's do envelope and i'm
29:22 - going to
29:23 - probably select the very first one over
29:25 - here as well
29:26 - and i'll just click to download that one
29:29 - i'll see if i can drag and drop that
29:30 - in and that has not appeared at all i'm
29:34 - not sure what happened there
29:35 - but that's okay we'll just delete this
29:37 - phone over here
29:38 - and i'm going to drag it in once more
29:40 - and i'm going to set the height and
29:42 - width here to
29:43 - 36 pixels great we'll also change the
29:47 - color here to be white
29:49 - and i'll just drag that here next to the
29:51 - email so we've got the email and the
29:52 - phone now done
29:54 - let's do the contact us section now
29:57 - for this section we'll have some forms
29:59 - here
30:00 - so as a form input i'm going to actually
30:03 - create a
30:04 - box here and i might give it a white
30:06 - color
30:07 - this will represent the input and i'll
30:09 - just increase the height here to about
30:11 - 60 so it's consistent with the rest of
30:13 - our buttons and stuff
30:14 - and i'll also put a placeholder text in
30:17 - here
30:18 - for this maybe i'll write something like
30:20 - full name and we can make this a little
30:23 - bit smaller
30:23 - maybe 24 pixels and
30:27 - we'll also give it a slight shade
30:30 - so maybe a 50 opacity will apply that
30:34 - there is our first input i'm going to
30:37 - copy that across
30:38 - and create a second one here and for
30:40 - this second one i'll do
30:42 - your email
30:45 - and we'll maybe create one last one here
30:48 - and this last one we can actually give
30:50 - it
30:50 - one more column for the sizing here and
30:53 - a little bit more height maybe 120 in
30:55 - this case
30:56 - and what this can be is our message
30:59 - so let's pass that in here finally we'll
31:02 - need a button
31:03 - people can click on so i'm going to copy
31:06 - over this input one more time
31:08 - and this time we'll drag it here in
31:10 - below
31:11 - and i'm going to reduce this width here
31:13 - to two columns
31:14 - and i'll type this in as maybe submit
31:17 - now we want this button to stand out a
31:19 - little bit we don't want it to be the
31:21 - same as our inputs
31:22 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
31:23 - give it a nice dark
31:25 - color not exactly black but like a dark
31:28 - gray which is a 333 in the hex colors
31:31 - and we'll change the font color here to
31:33 - be white at 100 opacity so that way we
31:36 - can see it standing out there
31:38 - so that's our contact form done that
31:40 - looks pretty good
31:41 - let's fill out our site map over here
31:44 - i'm going to copy the
31:46 - full name text over here and this can be
31:48 - used for our links
31:50 - i'm going to set this to a full white
31:52 - 100 opacity color
31:54 - and in here i'm just going to put in a
31:56 - couple of
31:57 - links this doesn't have to be anything
32:00 - special
32:01 - just copy out the same links that we had
32:03 - on our
32:04 - header here but uh what we can do
32:07 - is maybe we can play around with the
32:09 - sizing just a tad
32:11 - because it does feel like it's a little
32:12 - bit too small but
32:14 - once we do i can see that that's looking
32:16 - much better as we have more pages we
32:18 - could fill this out and we could even
32:20 - embed it
32:21 - indent it if we had sub pages but this
32:23 - is enough for our footer design here
32:26 - the only thing we're missing now is a
32:28 - copyright section
32:29 - so i'm going to actually create this at
32:30 - the very bottom here
32:32 - and i might give it a 100 pixels of
32:34 - height here
32:36 - and we'll give it a darker shade so what
32:39 - i'm thinking here
32:40 - is maybe the 333 color that we use for
32:42 - our submit button
32:44 - and let's copy over maybe our text here
32:48 - for our subtitle and place this above
32:51 - the
32:51 - element and what we want to do is just
32:54 - put in a generic copyright
32:56 - message in here so something like
32:57 - copyright 2020
33:00 - all rights reserved uh
33:04 - company name beautiful we couldn't even
33:07 - put in a copyright icon for that but
33:09 - for now i'm not going to worry too much
33:11 - about it it's also a little bit too big
33:13 - copyrights are usually a lot smaller so
33:15 - i'm going to reduce this to
33:16 - 24 pixels and i'm also going to
33:20 - center the text and center the
33:22 - positioning here so that it's exactly in
33:24 - the middle of our page
33:26 - so that looks much better now with our
33:29 - footer done we're mostly done with our
33:31 - home page and
33:32 - this has actually turned out quite good
33:34 - we can
33:35 - have a look at all the elements here and
33:38 - what we can see
33:39 - is that in terms of the spacing the only
33:42 - issue i have here is maybe
33:44 - this about us section is just a little
33:46 - bit too big
33:47 - i'd like maybe for there to be about 100
33:50 - pixels from the top and the bottom
33:52 - because that 200 is almost
33:53 - too much so what i'm gonna do is
33:56 - actually move this section
33:57 - up a little bit and we'll make sure that
33:59 - it's a hundred pixels from the top
34:01 - one two three four five six seven eight
34:04 - nine ten
34:05 - and this square here i'm going to resize
34:07 - it and just go
34:08 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
34:12 - beautiful and then we can move all the
34:14 - other elements
34:15 - up here so that is looking
34:19 - much better now let's just make sure we
34:20 - grab all of these and move them
34:22 - up so if we have a look now we have
34:25 - consistent spacing between each section
34:27 - we've got our header and footer
34:29 - and we just resize our uh our frame here
34:32 - a little bit just to cut
34:34 - out the bottom bit here now that we're
34:36 - finished with the home page let's
34:39 - take a look at our original wireframe
34:41 - and how it's been applied to our ui over
34:44 - here
34:45 - originally we had our slider image here
34:48 - and we've applied that with our logo and
34:50 - our menu here at the top
34:52 - and that's come across quite well we
34:54 - added some awesome icons here on the
34:56 - left and the right
34:57 - but we've also added in some text here
34:59 - and this is pretty important because a
35:01 - lot of the times when companies
35:03 - do have images they also want to carry
35:06 - across a statement and this will do that
35:09 - in terms of the next section here for
35:11 - about us we've followed the grid
35:13 - structure here
35:14 - of column design and we've made sure
35:16 - that everything is consistent
35:17 - so that later if you want to do a
35:18 - responsive design each one of these
35:20 - columns can break into a row
35:22 - and for the sponsors section we haven't
35:25 - added 12 sponsors in there we've just
35:27 - done six
35:28 - usually sponsor images are pretty big
35:30 - and if you
35:31 - have them really small you won't be able
35:32 - to see them properly this way by just
35:34 - having six right here they fit into that
35:37 - column design a lot more neatly
35:39 - and if we wanted to we could add more
35:40 - but they can also collapse down much
35:42 - easier too
35:44 - and finally we have our footer over here
35:46 - where we've had a contact us form
35:48 - a site map a logo and some contact
35:51 - information
35:52 - there's room here for growth as well if
35:53 - the site expands out further
35:55 - or at least these are the basics of what
35:58 - you would expect in a footer as well as
35:59 - our copy right there at the very bottom
36:02 - in the next video we might take a look
36:04 - at color theory and this is more
36:05 - complicated than some might realize
36:07 - this is figuring out which colors to use
36:10 - for this website
36:11 - maybe we'll have a primary color and a
36:13 - secondary color and we'll have to figure
36:15 - out which ones work together and which
36:16 - ones don't
36:17 - and we might actually work on some
36:19 - images too to see
36:20 - if we can make them work with the colors
36:22 - we pick but i hope you guys
