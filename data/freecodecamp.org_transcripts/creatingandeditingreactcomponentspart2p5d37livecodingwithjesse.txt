00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with Jesse I'm Jesse today we're gonna
00:09 - do some work with react and I must start
00:15 - out the stream by telling you a little
00:19 - bit about my morning so far just because
00:23 - it was out of the ordinary so if you
00:27 - notice I have a tie which I don't
00:29 - normally have so I thought that I had a
00:33 - presentation today and I was going to
00:36 - present this site that we've been
00:37 - working on to all the like the vice
00:40 - presidents and the heads of all the
00:41 - departments of the school and I thought
00:47 - that the meeting was going to be early
00:49 - like it was gonna start at 9:00 a.m. but
00:52 - I didn't know where it was so I thought
00:56 - wow I need to get up early and get in
00:57 - here early so I can get everything ready
00:59 - there were still a few more things that
01:01 - I wanted to do to the site before I
01:04 - presented so I got up at 5:30 a.m. and
01:08 - got on the exercise bike and started
01:12 - making some updates to the site then and
01:14 - my oldest son was actually up with me so
01:17 - I ended up only doing a little bit of
01:20 - work in the morning and then he and I
01:22 - watched YouTube videos and for the rest
01:26 - of my workout but then I got into work
01:28 - at 7:30 a.m. which is which is pretty
01:31 - early for me I never get in before 8:00
01:34 - and I was working and working and it was
01:38 - almost nine o'clock and I'm texting my
01:39 - boss like hey where's this meeting at
01:41 - and he finally texts me back and says oh
01:45 - it's tomorrow
01:47 - oh so the good news is I have more ready
01:59 - than I thought I would before the
02:01 - meeting and I have you know more time
02:03 - now to get things ready so that's cool
02:05 - I'm gonna meet later on today and kind
02:10 - of go over
02:13 - a little bit more about like what
02:17 - basically about what the people that I'm
02:20 - going to present to are looking for so I
02:22 - can make sure I give them the right
02:23 - information but anyway I said is what it
02:30 - is kind of like I wore the outfit I
02:36 - wanted or where to look professional
02:38 - today so I don't know what I'm gonna
02:40 - wear tomorrow
02:42 - but anyway that I guess so I've been
02:53 - doing a few things to the site I'll go
02:56 - over them just really quickly and then
02:58 - I'll check out the live chat as well
03:00 - before we start so I guess the most
03:07 - technically challenging thing that I did
03:10 - and it's still not very challenging but
03:11 - the most technically challenging thing
03:13 - is that we have different logos now
03:16 - depending on screen width so we have
03:22 - this more narrow version of the logo and
03:27 - then it comes out to the full version so
03:31 - I just did that with the built-in hidden
03:36 - components that material UI has so this
03:40 - is in the app bar component if you want
03:42 - to check it out everything in github is
03:44 - up to date so we're all starting at the
03:48 - same point and I'm gonna start up
03:50 - let me start our bank drop - before I
03:52 - forget so y'all can check this out as as
03:54 - I'm going over it and I'll put this in
04:00 - the live chat oops
04:04 - I don't have my screen up sorry anyway
04:07 - let me do this again so when we go like
04:11 - this the logo changes we pop it back out
04:16 - and it goes here so that's that's what
04:18 - it did sorry about that and then I
04:24 - changed this
04:25 - in the background-color I got rid of
04:27 - that purple that we had that was just
04:29 - kind of for demonstration to make sure
04:31 - it was full with and let's see I added
04:35 - in some some more cards with a Lum nigh
04:39 - profile and a faculty profile and so we
04:44 - went out some of those fairs and then I
04:46 - merged in a pull request from Harshit
04:49 - that fixed some of the errors that we
04:52 - were getting in the car I should say it
04:54 - warnings that we were getting and also
04:57 - fixed some issues we were having with
04:59 - client-side routing that I wasn't even
05:01 - aware of that we weren't getting the
05:03 - proper behavior with client-side routing
05:06 - because of the all the custom stuff we
05:09 - were doing with routing so if you want
05:13 - to check that out that's the last pull
05:15 - request that was merged in there was a
05:17 - lot to it so if you can go through I'm
05:22 - not even go through at all and in this
05:24 - dream because it could easily take up
05:25 - you know a half hour just going through
05:28 - it all but I appreciate that and some of
05:32 - the other things that it did do was
05:33 - harsh it fix this little hover so we get
05:37 - the correct color and I'll have to also
05:42 - do the same thing here so I'm just gonna
05:44 - have to look and see what he did and
05:47 - let's see that I fix I think I changed
05:52 - size and positioning of some things up
05:54 - here so a lot of little things nothing
05:57 - huge hearts should also did some work
05:59 - with the the cards to make them look a
06:02 - little nicer I still want to try it
06:08 - looks like right now everything just
06:10 - goes to two columns with some of these I
06:12 - think are too big like obviously these
06:13 - profiles like are getting just huge so
06:19 - might want to see about extending this
06:23 - to three columns at some point instead
06:25 - of just two but it does look a lot
06:30 - better than it did there's not as many
06:32 - gaps okay
06:38 - so today Sood I was working on oh sorry
06:47 - I said I was gonna check out the live
06:48 - chat first let me see what's in the live
06:50 - chat and then we'll be started hey josh
06:56 - says it's first time he got the first
07:00 - comment in its first time here so
07:02 - welcome thanks for coming in is here hey

07:13 - 24 says hello I'm brand new a coating
07:16 - just got to the dedication page product
07:18 - for HTML
07:19 - alright cool welcome if you're just
07:22 - starting out there may be a lot that

07:38 - explain as I'm going on hey a lot of
07:43 - other people saying hello Christopher
07:46 - you are not too late the live coding is
07:48 - about to start
07:55 - Michael says the even gooder news is
07:58 - that you can go to dinner tonight and
07:59 - look like an adult
08:00 - I actually I can't but my son has a
08:04 - karate class so probably not wife will
08:08 - be there because I don't think I'm gonna
08:09 - be home early enough to take him but I
08:12 - guess I will look alright Emerson said
08:18 - at least you're looking good today yeah
08:21 - let's see
08:33 - let's see Christopher brown says YouTube
08:37 - video on page is overrated try using
08:40 - custom video player I'm not sure which
08:46 - which you mean Christopher so let me
08:51 - know Lawson at 3 says shout out to my
09:03 - nephew Robert he's a 12 year old
09:04 - aspiring programmer all right awesome
09:07 - Robert that's really cool you your
09:09 - programming and twelve years old so keep
09:14 - at it and I'm sure you'll be if you're
09:19 - not already programming better than me
09:20 - you probably will be if you keep keep up
09:23 - the learning alright okay so that's
09:26 - everything right now that's in the live
09:28 - chat I'm gonna start my my Pomodoro
09:32 - timer and we're going to do 25 minutes
09:35 - of some coding and be working in react
09:39 - today after the 25 minute timer goes up
09:42 - I'm going to take a little break and go
09:44 - back to the live chat answer any
09:45 - questions that you have
09:49 - let's see also want to invite everyone
09:52 - if you happen to be on Instagram check
09:56 - out you if you want check out my
10:02 - Instagram profile there's a link to it
10:04 - if you go to my youtube channel that's
10:07 - linked in the description I have my
10:09 - links to all my social networks
10:10 - Instagram will be on there
10:12 - I think it's Jesse I go is my name but
10:16 - anyway I put coding stuff on there too
10:18 - and I also announce when I'm going to
10:24 - stream and I do on Twitter as well so if
10:26 - anybody's interested you like to watch a
10:28 - stream or like the kind of stuff that
10:30 - I'm doing that's just kind of another
10:31 - place where I I put some info all right
10:39 - so let's work on this top
10:43 - let me scroll down quickly actually
10:49 - let's let's do that this is what I was
10:51 - going through making sure that we're
10:55 - getting we have these set to the right
11:00 - sizes see cuz I kinda I don't want an
11:04 - image like this to be very small so
11:12 - let's go back here and change that while
11:15 - I I see it and before I forget
11:27 - there we go
11:29 - for now that'll just make it look a
11:31 - little bit nicer
11:39 - and yeah so we're not really it's not
11:45 - like this is the finished version of
11:46 - this or anything but if I do go to show
11:49 - a larger version you know on a larger
11:52 - screen tomorrow then at least there
11:54 - won't be gaps all right so let's look at
12:05 - this section here so what I'd like to do
12:10 - and I'm we have been going kind of
12:14 - mobile-first with everything but I know
12:16 - that in my presentation they're probably
12:19 - gonna want to see the full-screen
12:22 - version even if nobody asks I know my
12:25 - department had at some point is gonna
12:27 - say why don't you show them the full
12:28 - version so I want to get this cleaned up
12:32 - a bit I think that we could do without
12:36 - some of the space here and we could cut
12:38 - down on the space between these just a
12:40 - bit by a few pixels add more space and
12:43 - here lino saw better so there's a lot of
12:45 - alignment things that I think we could
12:47 - do yeah we can we definitely do some
12:51 - better things with that and that'll be
12:56 - the first thing that everyone sees so
12:59 - I'd say that's that's worth spending the
13:02 - limited time on that that we have before
13:04 - tomorrow's presentation well Christopher
13:08 - Brown did clarify about the video since
13:11 - you're using a YouTube video on the
13:12 - website rather than html5 video player
13:15 - which you can create your own style
13:17 - controls for the video player which is
13:20 - better than embedded YouTube video yeah
13:22 - we had thought about doing that I it's
13:25 - still possible we've done that on some
13:27 - other sites i popping a youtube video in
13:32 - here was just the easiest way to get
13:34 - something up on the screen to see how it
13:36 - looks so I'm still open to doing that
13:39 - the only thing I'm not sure about with
13:40 - the videos is and this is what I like
13:42 - about YouTube videos let me know
13:44 - Christopher if if there's something
13:46 - similar we can do as well with using the
13:51 - html5 video
13:53 - is for YouTube it will automatically
13:56 - scale the video resolution based on you
14:00 - know the user and what their connection
14:02 - is capable of can I do that somewhat
14:09 - easily with the html5 video tag and you
14:15 - know what would I need multiple versions
14:17 - of the video and if I go to switch video
14:21 - - I need multiple versions of it every
14:23 - time because these videos are gonna
14:26 - switch out and the the people who are
14:30 - going to be switching them aren't really
14:32 - going to be video people or coders so
14:35 - taking into account all of that is there
14:37 - way we could use the video tag instead
14:40 - of the YouTube embed to accomplish the
14:43 - same thing and still be as user friendly
14:45 - if there is a way and I just don't know
14:47 - about it I'd love to know about it
14:49 - because we could definitely get a nicer
14:51 - UI I don't like having the big red
14:54 - YouTube button right in the middle here
14:55 - it's not really part of our color scheme
15:06 - let's see okay so let's go into your
15:11 - check first of all let me make this
15:15 - bigger this is probably hard for
15:17 - everyone to see I'm gonna try to shrink
15:19 - this as small as I can and still keep
15:23 - you know what we can we could probably
15:26 - make this bigger let's just pop it up
15:29 - fullscreen there we go I kind of like it
15:38 - here like really small and then that way
15:40 - I'll know for sure whether I'm making
15:41 - this too big and it will overlap
15:43 - anything so first things first this logo
15:48 - I think could be a bit bigger but you
15:51 - know what maybe we oughta try to shrink
15:55 - this first before we mess with the logo
15:57 - and then that that way we'll know how
15:58 - much space above and below that we're
16:01 - working with that seems like that maybe
16:06 - that'll be the more sensible way to go
16:10 - about it
16:20 - all right so the first thing I do want
16:22 - to look at it these options because I
16:26 - think I I just put too much too much
16:33 - padding in here where am I even getting
16:36 - the padding at huh
16:47 - that's a
16:51 - hmm
17:08 - maybe the sketch that changed
17:19 - I thought I had this setup differently
17:22 - at some point maybe I was mistaken
17:34 - okay
17:49 - all right see what we have here I
17:52 - definitely think that we can take this
17:55 - padding off of the top so having top
18:03 - zero whoops you know I don't I don't
18:08 - want it off of here so let's get rid of
18:10 - it on here just put it on this outlet
18:15 - there we go so that removes a bit of
18:18 - space in here which is exactly what I
18:21 - wanted and that looks good so let's go
18:25 - over to the code now and find where I
18:28 - need to put this style in line for that
18:31 - to work
18:40 - and you should be in the app bar
18:43 - component
18:48 - oops
19:00 - oh you see this is where I did the the
19:02 - logos we just use this hidden component
19:04 - so the the logo that's just fu s is
19:09 - hidden on medium and up and then the D
19:11 - logo that is the full Franciscan is
19:17 - hidden on small and down just ended up
19:20 - being pretty simple once I remembered
19:23 - that this was an available component
19:27 - alright so here are all our social media
19:31 - icons so down below that will be the
19:35 - menu that we're trying to to change okay
19:43 - our menu item okay
19:58 - call them to bottom let's check out that
20:02 - class call them to bottom display flex
20:07 - okay so that is this display flex center
20:13 - Center and okay great so if we put this
20:16 - padding top zero on to here then we
20:20 - should be fine and since we're just
20:33 - putting a number an integer in here we
20:37 - don't need the quotation marks oh yeah
20:51 - okay so we've gotten rid of that style
20:55 - we just put in dev tools and you could
20:56 - see should we wait a second
21:02 - we may need to
21:05 - let's give it a refresh and just just to
21:08 - verify that that style is not working we
21:12 - need may need to make that an inline
21:14 - style then
21:21 - yep so it looks like our padding-top
21:26 - zero is being overridden by this so we
21:29 - could do we could put important here but
21:33 - I don't want to go too important that
21:36 - should be like the last thing that you
21:38 - try everything else doesn't work so
21:41 - since this is coming in a style tag this
21:44 - style tag evidently is being inserted
21:46 - further down the page than this one
21:48 - that's why it's overriding this one so
21:52 - it's also possible that this one is just
21:55 - more specific so if you see this just
21:57 - selects the class but this selects the
21:59 - class two classes right so the class
22:03 - that's the child of of this class so
22:07 - specificity could be an issue here as
22:09 - well but in any case we can without
22:12 - resorting to important we can definitely
22:14 - make this work if we just make it inline
22:17 - so let's go back to our code we'll take
22:19 - this out so we don't need it there and
22:22 - then we'll go down to our actual
22:26 - component and I know that this component
22:30 - is huge right now like this whole entire
22:32 - thing so eventually this will be
22:35 - refactor and everything will be split
22:37 - out into their own components so I just
22:40 - don't want anybody to think that we
22:42 - would like to leave a component like
22:44 - this because we won't but sometimes
22:48 - before things are finalized it's just
22:51 - easier to work with it in one place I
22:56 - find if I start to refactor too early
22:59 - sometimes I'll end up the leading
23:01 - components that I don't need anymore
23:02 - that I could have saved time and never
23:05 - even made them so on this grid item
23:08 - we're gonna add a style tag or style
23:13 - attribute and we're gonna put in double
23:18 - quote or double brackets which means
23:21 - we're gonna go into JavaScript first
23:23 - right with that first bracket and then
23:25 - the second bracket is since we're
23:27 - already in JavaScript the bracket just
23:28 - means a it's an object alright so we're
23:34 - going to pass it
23:35 - the script object and it will be
23:39 - padding-top we can okay suit and then we
23:44 - can put the zero and let's close that
23:47 - out so now when we save and check out
23:53 - our website we should see that as an
23:55 - inline style and it should override
23:57 - whatever else was there and we can see
24:03 - let's give it a refresh just just to
24:06 - make sure that's not anything left over
24:08 - from what we had there we go so here's
24:16 - our padding top that's showing up in
24:18 - line and that overrides the only thing
24:23 - now they could possibly override this
24:25 - style is if we were to put important and
24:28 - that's okay so since I did it like this
24:31 - that still leaves that possibility open
24:33 - later on if I'm if I really need to have
24:36 - something apply then I still have that
24:39 - option of using important so that's
24:42 - that's why we don't want to go straight
24:43 - to using important if we don't have to
24:46 - because then you you don't leave any
24:49 - option for yourself or other developers
24:51 - if they would like to you know change
24:54 - that then you know they're really
24:58 - limited that they have to go in and
25:00 - potentially change more than they would
25:02 - like to all right but anyway just just a
25:07 - few CSS thoughts from me so that's a
25:12 - little bit smaller okay I like that I
25:14 - think I think that's more reasonable in
25:19 - terms of height it's probably still a
25:21 - little bit taller than I would like but
25:25 - we you know we have two rows here for
25:28 - our content so you know maybe we could
25:31 - shrink this by another few pixels but I
25:34 - wouldn't go more than that at this point
25:37 - because it will get too jumbled so I
25:42 - think I'm gonna leave that for now as is
25:47 - and we can always go back and try to
25:48 - shrink it up more if we need to so since
25:51 - that as is here I do want to if I can
25:57 - quickly decrease the space here I would
26:01 - like to do that but I need to figure out
26:04 - where where we were actually getting
26:08 - that
26:20 - let's see okay I was just checking out
26:23 - my timer see how much time I have so in
26:26 - about eight minutes I'm gonna go back to
26:27 - the live chat and answer questions so if
26:29 - you have a question in there right now
26:30 - just please be patient for a few more
26:32 - minutes and and I will get to your
26:34 - question
26:43 - so I'm trying to figure out where this
26:47 - this gap is coming in if you could see
26:50 - the gap that's right here and then maybe
26:55 - I'm missing something but why
27:09 - and we're not setting the width of this
27:12 - element anywhere nowhere here we don't
27:21 - have any margin we have no padding set
27:26 - for that side I mean we do have text a
27:31 - line
27:51 - Masaki the chat really quickly to see if
27:54 - anyone sees anything that I don't
28:12 - all right I'm just gonna start going
28:15 - through some of these and seeing if
28:17 - anything okay all right so if we get rid
28:29 - of this display:inline-block that
28:31 - definitely that's an effect but it also
28:35 - gives us a lot more space up here as
28:38 - well
28:38 - and I'm pretty sure that we added this
28:43 - in for reason so I'd rather not break
28:46 - something
28:59 - hmm you can shrink things up a bit if we
29:03 - get rid of that line height
29:58 - okay umberto saying is there an outer
30:02 - container for those using something like
30:04 - flex yeah I mean here's our container
30:10 - with Flex which because of the delay
30:16 - that's what I'm probably seeing it
30:18 - before you're seeing it then Qatar
30:24 - Rahman then then Qatar Oman I'm sorry if
30:29 - I'm mispronouncing your name I'm trying
30:30 - to trying to sound it out anyway they
30:34 - say can you check the box model on the
30:36 - Ally yeah let's check computers
30:51 - but we did have something Warbucks
31:22 - yeahit's guess it's not gonna matter
31:26 - either way
31:27 - hey Nikki how's it going
32:32 - this this is probably unrelated but it
32:37 - kind of bothers me that there's no ul
32:39 - for these allies I don't know how that
32:43 - happened but it seems to me that these
32:45 - should all be inside of the UL right so
32:53 - maybe we could keep the grid here but I
32:56 - guess we just we didn't put them inside
32:59 - of UL because we created these hat bar
33:02 - menu item components which I haven't
33:07 - looked at that component for a long time
33:09 - yeah so these are all just allies so we
33:14 - really should be putting this in a ul
33:24 - I'm just kind of wondering you like
33:26 - would it mess up screen readers and
33:30 - things like that if we if we didn't have
33:33 - this
33:43 - and I don't really know the answer to
33:44 - that but we have kind of more proper use
33:51 - of the HTML tags and it's it's not gonna
33:55 - hurt yeah it is all right yeah so that
34:02 - definitely did mess things up let's
34:05 - let's see if we can switch this there we
34:12 - go
34:12 - okay so if we just move the all this
34:15 - flex stuff down one to our ul and then
34:23 - that helps all right
34:30 - so let's let's do that I'm about out of
34:33 - time for this Pomodoro session but I I
34:40 - think we're it in better shape here by
34:44 - adding the UL and so the last thing I'll
34:48 - do before we go - before I go to live
34:51 - chat answer some questions is I'm gonna
34:53 - put this class down on the UL
35:10 - see where that gets us okay
35:26 - yeah that's not bad we can work with
35:29 - that all right let me set my timer then
35:34 - for five minutes and my phone is buzzing
35:38 - a lot I just want to see if there's
35:42 - anything important water's being turned
35:48 - off on campus but not in my building all
35:52 - right okay
36:04 - and my wife is messaging me also I don't
36:08 - think it's an emergency all right I'm
36:24 - gonna scroll up just a little bit and
36:27 - it's not too much in the live chat so I
36:30 - may be able to get through it all we'll
36:31 - see you never know sometimes I talk for
36:34 - five minutes just about one question
36:49 - Oh Harshit says that he can watched live
36:53 - today because tomorrow is a school
36:55 - holiday cool cool that's awesome
36:58 - Harshit is there some other time of day
37:01 - that we could do the livestream that
37:04 - you'd be able to watch or is it just
37:05 - going to be too much for you when
37:07 - schools in session because I'm pretty
37:10 - flexible we could try to do this a
37:11 - different time if you want but I totally
37:15 - understand if that's just too much and
37:17 - you can't do the live streams because of
37:20 - school and I don't want this to detract
37:22 - at all from your studies but let me know
37:26 - if there is something I can do to help
37:28 - it be you know easier for you to watch
37:31 - if you want to today's at school all the
37:36 - day for my kids so they didn't have to
37:37 - go to school today which is why I could
37:39 - come in early so I didn't have to drop
37:41 - them off at school / beli asks what the
37:47 - best programming languages in 2018 I
37:49 - don't know if I could answer that I
37:51 - think it just depends on what you have
37:53 - experience in and what you're trying to
37:55 - do
37:57 - I can I can say I think this is a very
38:05 - reasonable thing to say that JavaScript
38:08 - is probably the most versatile
38:09 - programming language right now because
38:12 - you can do client-side and server-side
38:15 - programming there are ways to program
38:19 - you know robots with JavaScript VR a are
38:24 - native apps you can use electron to make
38:29 - you know desktop apps there's just a lot
38:33 - that you can program with JavaScript so
38:36 - it's JavaScript the best I don't really
38:38 - know it's what I like to use and you can
38:42 - do a lot with it but that's I don't
38:45 - think that's a question that's you can
38:47 - answer easily so hopefully my answer is
38:51 - okay but I mean I know it's not really
38:53 - an answer to the question but that's a
38:55 - good answer that question is beyond me
39:03 - how should ask did you read the notes in
39:05 - the last PR attentively I don't know if
39:09 - I'd say attentively I looked through all
39:12 - the code pretty attentively but maybe I
39:17 - did not read it as attentively as I
39:19 - could I often go back and read through
39:23 - more attentively because I know there's
39:27 - there is more that I need to do so I did
39:30 - read that part that there's a lot of
39:32 - stuff that needs change now I didn't
39:38 - have time though before the video to
39:40 - change those things
39:55 - okay so Christopher Brown if you
39:57 - remember from earlier in the stream we
39:58 - were talking about ways to present
40:01 - videos in a webpage and we're talking
40:06 - about YouTube embeds versus the video
40:09 - tag and so Christopher said you can do
40:12 - different resolutions for different size
40:14 - devices and pixel densities with source
40:16 - set however Christopher is not aware of
40:20 - a way to do this with network speeds
40:24 - okay so I guess I'm gonna stick with the
40:29 - YouTube embeds for now because I really
40:32 - like that we can take into account a
40:36 - user's network speed I don't I want to
40:40 - avoid to things that that are a bad user
40:45 - experience so on the one hand you just
40:48 - put in high quality video and you people
40:53 - without a good network connection you
40:57 - know have a lot of buffering it doesn't
40:58 - play or people have a good network
41:01 - connection and it just crushes their
41:03 - data right so I don't want that but then
41:06 - the other extreme is okay well let's
41:08 - just put in really low quality videos so
41:11 - we respect people's data usage but then
41:15 - everybody gets you know this degraded
41:19 - user experience because they don't can't
41:21 - get the high quality videos so I don't
41:24 - really see it I think it would be
41:26 - difficult to find a way between those
41:31 - two extremes if we go with using source
41:33 - set with the video tag since it's
41:36 - already built in and it works with
41:37 - YouTube embed we do have to live with
41:40 - some limited functionality and we can't
41:42 - customize it completely but but in
41:45 - exchange for that I think we're giving
41:47 - the users a much better user experience
41:49 - we're also giving them the option to
41:51 - like save our video for later so you
41:55 - know if we go down here the video I can
41:58 - share right from here so we have the
41:59 - sharing right there we don't have to do
42:02 - anything extra to get that we can save
42:04 - it for later which i think is a really
42:07 - nice feature
42:09 - and then that will also direct users to
42:13 - our YouTube channel for more content and
42:15 - that all comes built in so there's
42:18 - definitely trade-offs the embed is not
42:21 - for every situation the YouTube embed
42:24 - but if you can get away with it and that
42:27 - your client is okay with having some
42:30 - YouTube logos going on on their page you
42:33 - do get a you know a lot of advanced
42:35 - functionality you know basically for
42:38 - free so that's what we're going to use
42:42 - for now I do appreciate the suggestion
42:45 - though and if we can yeah if there were
42:50 - another way to do it I you know I'd
42:54 - definitely be up for it okay it looks
43:01 - like my timer did go off here but let me
43:07 - look I'm almost to the bottom of the
43:09 - live chat all right so we got we have a
43:15 - vote for the YouTube player San Bay says
43:22 - you look it's a misspelling but I'm
43:25 - assuming it meant to say you look good
43:27 - and if that's what is what you meant to
43:30 - save and thank you I tried to look good
43:32 - I shaved like this little top part of
43:35 - the beard you know and under here I
43:37 - combed my beard like I tried to bet I
43:43 - didn't have my presentation today but I
43:48 - guess I look alright for YouTube
44:04 - okay so I'm going to when I come back
44:07 - I'm gonna start within his question so
44:10 - any questions do you enjoy being a
44:12 - developer and so that's what we'll start
44:14 - with when after we do this next Pomodoro
44:17 - session let me see the time okay yeah
44:22 - we're definitely only gonna do one more
44:23 - session we might not even do a full
44:24 - session so basically since I came into
44:27 - work so early I'm gonna be at the point
44:29 - where I put in all the time I was
44:31 - supposed to put in today really soon but
44:34 - then I also have a meeting later and
44:36 - then so I have two meetings later
44:38 - back-to-back so to avoid me going over
44:43 - my normal time I'm gonna take like a
44:45 - break so after this stream I'm going to
44:48 - work on the coding challenge that I was
44:52 - working on over the weekend so some of
44:54 - you saw on my channel I need a live
44:56 - stream Saturday morning well it was
44:57 - Saturday morning Eastern Time so I'm
45:00 - gonna go back and work on that
45:02 - I may even stream that on my channel if
45:03 - anybody's interested I think I I came
45:09 - close to a solution but I don't it was
45:11 - not the best way to do it so I might
45:14 - just change the whole thing but it needs
45:15 - to be done before Thursday so anyway
45:19 - that's why I'm not gonna do a longer
45:21 - stream today so I'll kind of take a
45:25 - little break work on that and then when
45:27 - it's time for my meetings oh I'll go to
45:30 - those all right so let me get back to
45:36 - we're working on ok I just kind of
45:40 - messed this up so do we have these
45:46 - little yeah we have these little disks
45:50 - here text-decoration we need
45:56 - text-decoration on here as well
46:02 - so I kind of work now I need to put them
46:05 - on the El eyes now it's list I wasn't it
46:15 - yeah I don't know why I sent text
46:18 - decoration list-style-type:none there we
46:26 - go okay so that you oneís
46:28 - list-style-type:none we popped that you
46:33 - owe in let's go up and put it in our
46:35 - class might not be a bad idea to rename
46:39 - this class
46:48 - let's do this
46:53 - menu lists lists outside none and that's
47:06 - gonna get rid of that little that disk
47:08 - or that circle that comes right next to
47:10 - all our list items so I don't know if
47:13 - you could see it on on your screen but
47:15 - it was showing up as white it was hard
47:18 - to see but if it happened to overlap
47:21 - another letter before it then you could
47:23 - see it and now we need to change this to
47:26 - menu this down here I think is this will
47:29 - make this naming will make more sense
47:30 - that'll be easier for me and anybody
47:33 - else working on this to tell what we're
47:36 - talking about then you list let's save
47:43 - that and verify that it did what we want
47:47 - looks like it awesome so I'm gonna
47:55 - refresh yeah
47:57 - all right that looks good now we're
48:00 - gonna do some work in dev tools just to
48:02 - get the spacing looking good so let's
48:09 - put some padding around these a tags
48:14 - that'll give us a larger click area so
48:17 - let's do padding I want to do padding
48:22 - let's say zero so we want top and bottom
48:28 - to be zero but then left and right to be
48:31 - four pixels
48:37 - okay so you got four pixels here and
48:43 - then if we go up to the L eyes and we
48:48 - put padding zero for pixels okay that's
48:58 - too big
49:01 - gives us a gap yeah I think this was the
49:04 - gap that we were working with before oh
49:06 - nice a bonus from what happened is we
49:08 - now this is not lined up vertically in a
49:13 - much better place here with with the
49:15 - rest of what we have so that's nice okay
49:20 - I'm gonna let me know in the live chat
49:24 - what do you think that this is too much
49:29 - space am I losing my mind here or what
49:33 - to me it just seems like too much space
49:44 - if I drop that down to two pixels is
49:48 - that more reasonable I kind of like that
49:58 - okay so it looks like more space is
50:00 - better so it looks like you are okay
50:02 - with that
50:03 - okay I'll flip it back back up so this
50:05 - gives us like sixteen pixels space we
50:14 - have four on there a tags and then four
50:17 - on our allies so that means between
50:19 - these were four four four and four which
50:21 - is 16
50:23 - okay all right I'm okay with that if you
50:28 - all think it looks fine because I'm
50:31 - going to point an hour I've looked at
50:32 - this for way too long like I mean I've
50:35 - been looking at variations of this for
50:37 - literally months now because we've kind
50:40 - of been working on this even before we
50:42 - started working on the rest of the site
50:43 - so I don't think I'm in a place right
50:46 - now or I can look at this you know
50:50 - and in the right way you know definitely
50:53 - no with fresh eyes okay all right cool
50:58 - so let's add these on so we need to add
51:00 - it to the a tag and we need to add to
51:02 - the Li so that means we're going to be
51:03 - in that component we made for each of
51:05 - those items that app bar menu component
51:07 - so we have our list Li and then for a
51:12 - class name and then their ul link what
51:16 - was I thinking when I came up with these
51:17 - class names I mean I guess it makes
51:24 - sense but I'm just not sure why I said
51:26 - ul link would we say padding:0 for and
51:38 - then we're going to do the same thing
51:40 - here the reason that I'm not putting all
51:45 - the padding on one element is because I
51:48 - want well I want two things I want to
51:52 - have a larger click area so if you see
51:57 - that the area you can click actually
51:59 - starts before you even hit the text so I
52:04 - want that larger click area it makes it
52:06 - easier to click but then I also don't
52:09 - want click areas right next to each
52:10 - other so you accidentally click the
52:12 - wrong thing so by using half the padding
52:15 - we want on the LI and the other half on
52:18 - the a we get both so we have a little
52:21 - bit extra so we have four pixels all the
52:24 - way around that extends further than the
52:26 - text to click but then we also have four
52:31 - pixels all the way around here which
52:33 - means we actually get eight pixels right
52:36 - so four for this Ally and four for this
52:38 - Li of space between so you see as I run
52:42 - my mouse over you can see the cursor
52:44 - changes so there's an area where I'm
52:47 - clicking right now and nothing's
52:49 - happening that's that's good that's what
52:51 - we want
52:52 - oops okay that's why I did it like that
52:58 - now I want to see if we can decrease
53:01 - this space because one since I did this
53:04 - I added this ul and you can see this ul
53:07 - comes in with all of this margin at the
53:09 - top and we definitely don't need that
53:12 - and we probably don't need any at the
53:13 - bottom either so let's get rid of any
53:17 - margin for this so we do that with
53:21 - margin zero wonderful all right this is
53:27 - what I was I was wanting in terms of the
53:30 - look for this top app bar you know you
53:36 - can't make it really slim if you're
53:38 - gonna have two rows of content but this
53:42 - is about as slim as we can make it I
53:45 - think and still leave enough space for
53:48 - everything to be readable and clickable
53:53 - all right great let's add that on to
53:56 - that ul then in our code so we need to
53:59 - jump back into our app bar and go to
54:02 - this menu list up at the top here and
54:07 - let's add our margin zero okay and the
54:17 - last thing that I want to do up here I
54:21 - would still like maybe to see this be a
54:23 - little bit more slim as a button but I I
54:27 - don't want to nitpick right now hmm
54:29 - that's interesting okay this is kind of
54:35 - it let's see if it doesn't when the
54:37 - screen is larger okay it doesn't alright
54:42 - so there's going to be an odd situation
54:43 - where if the screen is narrow enough
54:51 - it's gonna drop down like that I don't
54:55 - like that I'm gonna leave it alone for
54:58 - now I'll leave it alone for now in the
55:06 - hopes that maybe we could get this we
55:10 - could change this name or yeah yeah I
55:17 - don't think it's likely to happen but I
55:20 - know not everybody that kind of has a
55:25 - say in this really likes the title being
55:27 - faith in life right here so there's a
55:29 - chance that this might change so I'm not
55:32 - gonna try to fix this if it's gonna
55:33 - change all right so the last thing I
55:38 - want to do up here is make this larger
55:41 - so let's see where we have okay so right
55:45 - now it's just controlled I believe by
55:47 - this max height 3 or M let's see three
55:52 - point one three point five okay
56:03 - yeah so I actually I don't want it to be
56:07 - I don't want to do the height on this
56:12 - this is changing the height I believe
56:15 - for more than one section and let's see
56:23 - what happens if I add an height 100
56:31 - pixels all right that max height is so
56:35 - overriding header image but I could
56:40 - change the max Heights area
56:56 - all right so with it being this large I
57:00 - just want to see if we I see so if we do
57:06 - make it that large then at some point
57:09 - we're gonna squish all these what just
57:13 - happened that's weird
57:23 - okay so let's let's go here and then we
57:28 - can really see at what point I need to
57:31 - stop making that bigger so let's go
57:37 - excite pixels so I definitely don't want
57:44 - it to be on your pixels but I thought
57:48 - I'd just start there Wow 48 this is the
57:56 - largest I can make it
58:04 - all right see how 48 looks we make it
58:06 - bigger uh I think I'm okay with 48 and
58:19 - I'm okay with that for now let me know
58:27 - where did that go
58:43 - I think I lost it when I was moving in
58:46 - and out whoops
58:58 - huh so that was already what we had
59:00 - anyway huh so this is actually what we
59:04 - had exactly so I guess we're keeping
59:09 - that yeah it really only looks small
59:15 - compared to the height we have on this
59:19 - and the amount of white space we have
59:22 - above and below so I don't like that I
59:26 - think I just wanted to have less white
59:28 - space but I mean I I suppose that I
59:37 - could just use a media query so that
59:39 - once we get down here then it starts to
59:44 - get smaller
59:51 - yeah let's try that let's see if we can
59:55 - use choose a media query to change the
59:59 - max height and make it
60:05 - let's try 80 pixels of course if we do
60:11 - that we need to also change this just
60:24 - right now where we're setting this
60:27 - height all right so we need to we need
60:35 - to change two places
60:45 - let's do that now before I forget
60:47 - alright so in our app bar I should have
60:52 - our image our header image and in our
60:57 - header image we can let's grab this
61:01 - media query and just reuse it now this
61:06 - is kind of the a different way to do
61:10 - media queries it's not going to look
61:11 - like what you used to it with regular
61:12 - CSS but since this is a JavaScript
61:15 - object we're going to do things
61:19 - differently and I lost there it is we're
61:22 - gonna put a comma remember this is
61:24 - JavaScript objects we need commas
61:25 - between all the items here but then down
61:28 - here we're gonna say and small and down
61:30 - so in this case we don't want small and
61:33 - down we want large and up so I think
61:45 - that should give us what we want we want
61:47 - large and up and we want that to be max
61:50 - height 80 pixels and let's copy that and
62:02 - set this on the menu button I'm not 100%
62:10 - sure this is the right one but let's try
62:12 - it was set on the menu button and we'll
62:15 - make the what was at the height the
62:18 - height 70
62:25 - okay now we'll save that and see what
62:29 - happens all right so it's it's large
62:35 - right now we have that height 70 okay we
62:39 - have the media query showing up great so
62:44 - right there right where we wanted it it
62:46 - changes awesome awesome right and we're
62:53 - actually on just by me kind of
62:55 - eyeballing that it was only by a pixel
62:57 - or two you can see just very slight
62:59 - movement so I'm not even gonna try to
63:02 - make that precise because who's gonna
63:03 - sit here other than us and go like this
63:06 - to see the difference okay nice that
63:12 - header is looking like it's looking like
63:16 - it should look I still think that this
63:19 - icon here is a little bit off the the
63:23 - vertical alignment is off so wonder how
63:30 - we can correct that if I do
63:34 - [Music]
63:42 - oops there we go
63:50 - wonderful okay so for all these items I
63:53 - had padding-bottom of eight pixels so I
63:56 - just added the same padding-bottom of
63:58 - eight pixels to this and that'll work so
64:01 - let's just do that
64:02 - now in our app bar menu item whoops
64:05 - that's not it so we put it in I think we
64:10 - have it actually in this component so on
64:14 - our SVG icon the class name is search
64:17 - SVG so we'll add it there search SVG or
64:25 - is it at a show kind of sushi clothes
64:32 - search SVG there we go
64:40 - padding-bottom eight pixels save it
64:54 - great alright
65:02 - cool I'm I'm actually I'm pretty happy
65:07 - with that right now this is yeah this is
65:17 - probably the nicest that this app bar
65:19 - has looked so far
65:22 - all right I'm happy enough with this
65:25 - that I'm I would I would present this at
65:29 - my meeting so I think we're I'm gonna
65:31 - stop messing with this now to leave time
65:35 - for other things
65:36 - let me check how much time I have left
65:39 - here all three minutes okay let's just
65:42 - do a git status here see what we've
65:47 - changed get add and we're gonna do a
65:52 - yarn yarn cm okay that's gonna help us
65:58 - walk through this commit message so uh
66:02 - nice let's do a fix and say it's gonna
66:08 - be a just item spacing whoops ad j ust
66:25 - just a boy I was facing okay that's
66:32 - pretty much what we did right yeah okay
66:38 - hopefully we pass all the linting and
66:40 - the tests and everything and then I can
66:43 - push that to get up and everything will
66:46 - be available
66:54 - awesome
67:01 - okay cool I'm gonna go to the live chat
67:04 - now and answer all the rest of the
67:05 - questions so if you have a question
67:07 - please put it in the chat now and I will
67:12 - do my best to get through everything see
67:14 - how I am on time okay good
67:17 - yes so like I said after I end this
67:19 - stream I may take a little break and
67:21 - then I'm gonna work on another
67:22 - JavaScript problem on I'm gonna
67:25 - livestream it on my channel so not on
67:27 - the free code camp channel on my channel
67:28 - if anybody's interested that's going to
67:31 - be its it's not react at least not yet
67:33 - it's just plain vanilla JavaScript I
67:36 - mean it's it's node so it's JavaScript
67:38 - on the server side so I'm just working
67:41 - through a coding puzzle just with
67:45 - regular regular JavaScript so if you're
67:48 - interested come come join me there on my
67:53 - channel about I don't know maybe about
67:55 - 15 minutes after I finish up here okay
68:03 - I'm gonna scroll up I know I said I'd
68:06 - start with his question okay so in ass
68:11 - do you enjoy being a developer I I do
68:14 - enjoy being a developer so there are
68:17 - some parts of being a developer that
68:19 - aren't that great
68:20 - but I don't think it necessarily has to
68:23 - do with being a developer it's just I
68:26 - don't know work situation so trying to
68:32 - think if there's anything developer wise
68:34 - that I don't like hmm I really I like it
68:42 - I like building things I don't even mind
68:45 - that much when they don't work it's kind
68:47 - of to me like like a puzzle
68:49 - I try to figure out where the bug is I I
68:57 - guess the part that I don't enjoy a lot
69:01 - of times is like at the very beginning
69:04 - of a project trying to think about how
69:06 - I'm gonna do the layout more of the
69:10 - design side of things
69:11 - that takes me a long time
69:15 - so it's and that part I'm not really
69:19 - doing a lot of coding I'm just doing a
69:21 - lot of thinking and searching through
69:23 - other websites there's fine inspiration
69:25 - so I don't know that part it's kind of
69:30 - weird for me if it takes a really long
69:32 - time I don't like it but if if I kind of
69:35 - get on a roll with an idea and it starts
69:37 - to work then it's really fun but
69:40 - otherwise I like it the part the part of
69:43 - my job currently that I don't like as
69:45 - much as I'm not a big fan of all the
69:47 - meetings
69:47 - I don't mind meetings if they're like
69:50 - like video chat
69:53 - meetings because then like I'm still at
69:56 - my desk I can still you know like
69:59 - looking's up on my other screen if I
70:01 - need to when you're at a meeting it's
70:06 - it's kind of rude to be working on other
70:08 - things like in person when you're out a
70:11 - meeting but a lot of times I attend
70:12 - meetings and there's a lot of stuff at
70:14 - the meetings that doesn't pertain to me
70:17 - at all so that just kind of like is
70:21 - mind-numbing sometimes also it sometimes
70:28 - it depends on who you're working with
70:29 - you know you get a client that has a lot
70:33 - of really strong opinions that aren't
70:34 - necessarily the best practices that can
70:38 - be tough and that's not that's not
70:41 - really fun to work with a client like
70:43 - that but otherwise I do I do like it
70:53 - okay I had asked hard earlier if
70:55 - there was a time I could stream that
70:57 - would be better and says now it's you
70:59 - know it's 12 hours between between us
71:02 - here so okay well that's too bad hard
71:07 -  I really appreciate you being in so
71:09 - many of the streams and helping out and
71:11 - so I hope you do really well with your
71:17 - studies though and we'll still be
71:20 - working on projects together then cut
71:27 - says a new do stream so welcome thanks
71:31 - for watching how did you get your your
71:33 - work to let you stream also why did you
71:37 - move from tomato timer to pom-pom
71:40 - so all these for the second question
71:42 - first because heart should also already
71:43 - answered in live chat and he said
71:45 - because pom-pom is made by me yes so
71:48 - harsh it made the pom-pom timer and as
71:52 - he says it is a dark theme and I love
71:53 - dark theme stuff so so that's why I
71:57 - switched yeah when I should said hey I
71:58 - made this try it out I tried it out I
72:00 - liked it so so that's why I use that and
72:06 - for getting my work sorry huh
72:15 - forgetting my work to let me stream I
72:18 - just talked to my boss and said this was
72:22 - before I was even streaming for free
72:23 - code cam this was when I was just
72:25 - streaming for on my own channel and I'd
72:27 - get like one or two viewers sometimes
72:29 - out of no viewers how but I just came in
72:32 - one day and said I was thinking about it
72:35 - and had an idea maybe I could stream my
72:37 - work and it might be good for like maybe
72:43 - the computer science students to see it
72:45 - and maybe they might be interested and
72:47 - want to come work on projects with us
72:48 - and it'll help them with their
72:50 - portfolios and it'll help us because
72:52 - we'll have more people working on our
72:53 - stuff and so my boss thought yeah that's
72:56 - a good idea and then shortly thereafter
73:00 - I was invited to stream for free code
73:02 - camp and my boss thought that was a
73:05 - really good idea
73:06 - because it would be a lot of publicity
73:09 - free publicity for the university
73:12 - and also you know we have so many people
73:18 - looking at the sights as we're coding
73:21 - it's just you know you're gonna have a
73:23 - better product like that and so many
73:25 - times you all catch errors before I
73:28 - catch them you make pull requests and
73:32 - you know the projects are a lot better
73:34 - because of you so anyway so my boss
73:37 - realized you know right away that you
73:40 - know this was this is only going to
73:42 - benefit us my project roll with the
73:45 - source anyway so it's not like we're
73:48 - letting out secrets or anything but I am
73:51 - I'm very grateful that that he lets me
73:54 - do this and everybody my department is
73:56 - very supportive of it
74:04 - Christopher Braun says you can still
74:06 - give them the option of selecting
74:07 - different video qualities and then
74:09 - loading the one they select yeah that's
74:12 - true Christopher yeah we could we could
74:15 - have them select the video qualities
74:19 - yeah that's an option let's see
74:28 - see and
74:40 - okay um car says random question which
74:43 - is best for post on spring boot rest
74:49 - fetch or using Axios I prefer using
74:53 - fetch I haven't really had much
74:56 - experience with Axios so I can't do a
74:58 - proper comparison between the two but it
75:01 - just seems to me that you know fetch is
75:03 - already built in like why not just use
75:07 - fetch fetch to me seems really simple
75:12 - maybe Axios has more things available
75:15 - I denied use it and they're good
75:19 - developers so you know maybe there's
75:21 - something to Axios that I don't know
75:23 - about that would make it better but you
75:26 - know in terms of what what I use I I use
75:28 - fetch and I always recommend fetch
75:31 - Christopher Brown says why aren't you
75:34 - using a separate CSS file we are for
75:37 - some components and for other components
75:40 - for not so it's nice for me at least I
75:45 - really like being able to use the have
75:47 - the styles right here so that there's
75:50 - only one file you need for this
75:53 - component so the component is very
75:55 - reusable so I I like that I like to do
76:00 - it like that when I can some places I
76:04 - we're bringing in another CSS file and
76:12 - the way the reason we needed to do that
76:15 - is because we're importing some HTML
76:17 - from that we pulled out of an old
76:21 - database and we can't directly use this
76:29 - you know the CSS that we're putting in
76:32 - this javascript object we can't assign
76:34 - that to places because we don't have
76:36 - access to that like right here so the
76:40 - only way that we could style that the
76:43 - stuff that we're pulling in on the fly
76:45 - is is to use a an external stylesheet so
76:54 - so I guess the answers we are using it
76:56 - just not in every place
76:58 - so basically when we can get away with
77:00 - not using a separate CSS file
77:02 - we don't use one we put it right there
77:04 - in the component in the component form
77:07 - or reusability
77:22 - Christopher Brown says here's a tip find
77:24 - what whitespace feels good then double
77:26 - it I like that I like that I've never
77:30 - heard that but I will have to keep that
77:34 - in my let's see nasrullah says how are
77:39 - you I'm okay okay I was up pretty early
77:44 - had some unexpectedly prepared I
77:48 - prepared for a meeting that unexpectedly
77:50 - wasn't happening today it's happening
77:51 - tomorrow but other than other than that
77:54 - I'm okay how are you doing
78:05 - Christopher Brown says why not just use
78:08 - margin isn't two sets of padding a bit
78:09 - weird yeah I didn't think about that
78:13 - until now and it's kind of weird I could
78:16 - have just used the margin yeah you're
78:22 - right I guess in my mind the way I was
78:25 - thinking about it
78:26 - lead the way I was visualizing it was
78:29 - convincing these two separate components
78:32 - and how much padding they would have so
78:33 - when I went to write what it would be I
78:36 - just immediately wrote it like that but
78:40 - you're right it would have been the same
78:43 - if I would have just put margin and
78:48 - padding on the a the a tag so yeah
78:54 - you're right either way it's the same
78:56 - you get the same effect but in this case
79:03 - we're adding an it's a it's the same
79:06 - amount of lines of code to I suppose but
79:11 - yeah I guess it might be a bit a bit
79:13 - weird to do it like that
79:23 - software death said I would match the
79:26 - logo with the menu and make the social
79:29 - icons smaller on top says react looks
79:32 - neat though I've never used it before
79:34 - new projects ok cool I think thanks for
79:38 - the advice that let me check it out so
79:43 - I'm not exactly sure what you mean
79:46 - matching the logo with a menu but
79:52 - definitely make this social icon smaller
79:56 - we might go smaller I did decrease the
79:59 - size a little bit from what they were
80:01 - originally I might be able to go smaller
80:08 - I'll see I mean maybe they just look my
80:13 - screen makes everything everything looks
80:15 - a little smaller on my screen than it it
80:17 - seems like it looks on what I'm
80:19 - presenting so I'll see how these looks
80:22 - how these look what I'm presenting and
80:24 - maybe I can make them smaller cuz I
80:28 - really don't want to emphasize these too
80:29 - much I'd rather have users click one of
80:32 - these buttons than one of these buttons
80:35 - so I may end up making this smaller but
80:41 - I'm glad you said that because I wasn't
80:43 - sure if if it would be too small
80:52 - Nikki says how about a search bar
80:54 - replaces the links went open that could
81:01 - happen that yeah we could do that oh
81:11 - yeah that's not going to be something
81:13 - that I try to get done like today but
81:18 - that that would actually work and then
81:21 - it wouldn't matter how you know how many
81:24 - items we have in here we still wouldn't
81:26 - have to worry about it because anytime
81:27 - that's open they wouldn't even be
81:29 - visible yeah I like that idea what do
81:36 - y'all think about that just when this is
81:38 - open all this just goes away
81:41 - and this covers everything
81:52 - okay Joey says maybe use faith in life
81:55 - with the with an ampersand instead of an
81:57 - end yeah though that would actually cut
82:00 - it down a little bit often saw that
82:03 - stuff it's not gonna be my call
82:05 - ultimately my boss is lefty enough to
82:08 - make that decision but maybe I'll
82:10 - mention it to my boss and see see what
82:13 - he thinks
82:18 - let's see Jim Jim mugs I'm not sure how
82:25 - to pronounce that
82:26 - Jim is a Jim alex gameplay alright Laney
82:31 - Way says you can make a bar underneath
82:35 - the menu in order to fix that problem a
82:40 - bar
82:51 - I'm not sure are you talking about this
82:55 - problem where these stack on top of each
82:58 - other
83:06 - okay so Nikki saying the same behavior
83:09 - that the search does on firebase Google
83:15 - comm are this check
83:28 - oh wow yeah that gets that takes up all
83:34 - the space
83:35 - interesting
83:43 - okay let me know what you all think
83:46 - about that I kind of like that hmm
83:59 - see what happens when you'd say okay so
84:02 - it hit make suggestions - okay cool
84:33 - mr. Brown says you should try taking a
84:35 - logo and cropping it so that the text
84:37 - can be HTML and CSS it says and look a
84:43 - lot nicer I am I'm pretty limited in
84:48 - what I can do to the logo so I don't
84:52 - know I mean assuming that I could find
84:54 - this exact font which I have no idea
84:57 - what font this is I mean maybe I could I
85:02 - could do it but the way we like the logo
85:08 - is pretty much set I can't change the
85:11 - logo I just I put the logo in there so
85:15 - I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that
85:17 - or not
85:25 - the cursor also says the social media
85:30 - should probably be at the bottom of the
85:31 - page having at the top is a bit odd and
85:33 - removing the clutter would benefit the
85:36 - overall design of the page yeah I could
85:41 - see I could ask my boss about this I
85:44 - don't like I don't even remember why we
85:45 - initially decided to put these up here
85:51 - so yeah that's that's definitely an
85:57 - option so I'll see what my boss says if
86:02 - he wants him up there obviously I'm
86:04 - gonna leave him up there but yeah you're
86:06 - right we don't need them up there we
86:07 - could certainly put them in the footer
86:32 - it's so Jim Alex gameplay says when the
86:37 - onclick event happens on that lens a bar
86:41 - should pop out underneath the menu more
86:45 - stylish and fixes your problem so you
86:48 - wanna click event oh okay so you're
86:54 - saying that the search should pop out
86:56 - underneath instead of scooting
86:59 - everything over okay yeah that's another
87:10 - option I have to think about that
87:25 - all right harsh it's asking if I can
87:27 - check out the messaging page for
87:29 - JavaScript AF I can I'll take a look at
87:34 - that after the after the stream
87:47 - casue Brown says your page is slow
87:51 - because you did the background
87:53 - attachment fix currently this has
87:55 - terrible performance so it'd be better
87:57 - to use separate div with a background
87:59 - and set the position to fixed okay cool
88:05 - yeah actually
88:08 - so whenever if I assume that you're
88:12 - loading this then on with Engram so it
88:18 - is slow on your machine because I
88:23 - haven't noticed that it's slow on any of
88:26 - my machines usually when I've used
88:27 - background position:fixed as long as I
88:29 - only use it on one element I don't see
88:32 - any performance decrease if I use it on
88:35 - a lot of elements on one page then I do
88:37 - see it but I mean this the machine that
88:42 - I'm on right now is probably better than
88:44 - what most users will have so if if you
88:47 - are actually seeing a performance
88:49 - decrease then yeah then maybe I need to
88:53 - do it a different way
89:12 - Nikki said the girl's head gets cropped
89:15 - have dev tools at the bottom okay Nikki
89:17 - so I'm assuming then like your window is
89:19 - pretty short then and
89:28 - yeah with things like that I'm not I'm
89:33 - not super worried about this happening
89:35 - on a screen like this because no one has
89:39 - a screen like this like they'd have to
89:41 - shape their window differently for that
89:42 - to happen so I mean if this happened on
89:47 - a normal screen size I'd be more worried
89:49 - about it off to check yeah you know what
89:55 - it is even covering it up here that's
89:57 - this is miss still isn't a normal screen
90:00 - size but yeah maybe I will need to drop
90:04 - this down a bit I haven't really worried
90:07 - about it because I wasn't sure if I
90:09 - would keep this image or not but we
90:14 - could probably do like background
90:15 - position wide drop it down a little bit
90:18 - and then that would that probably worked
90:22 - for most screen sizes
90:31 - yeah
90:48 - see my colleague Brian just reminded me
90:56 - in the lab chat that there's a 3:00 p.m.
90:58 - meeting today bring your laptop I will
91:01 - be there
91:02 - [Laughter]
91:23 - same basis as a problem with a lamp
91:29 - server as if we know some about it I
91:31 - don't I don't know anything about lamp
91:33 - servers
91:34 - does any if anybody in the live chat
91:36 - does please let let somebody know and
91:42 - maybe maybe you can help them out
91:49 - Nietzsche says use Axios recently it has
91:52 - a lot of nice things built in and it has
91:54 - better support without a polyfill for
91:56 - fetch which create react tab has by
92:01 - default okay all right cool so Niki
92:05 - saying
92:06 - Axios does have some other stuff
92:09 - built-in which I kind of figured that
92:11 - would be the case so I guess it's just
92:14 - you know your personal preference or
92:16 - what you have to do a lot of times I
92:19 - just do basic things with fetch maybe if
92:22 - you're doing something more advanced
92:24 - Axios might be the way to go Harshit
92:28 - says one big drawback I found using
92:31 - fetch is you can't add eventlistener to
92:34 - file upload progress okay that's that's
92:39 - interesting so that actually is kind of
92:43 - a big deal if you need that
92:44 - functionality are says then you have to
92:48 - use xhr and Axios is built with xhr so
92:52 - it can easily do that I'm quite cool
92:55 - Harrison says 34 year old father -
92:58 - trying to transition to web dev
93:00 - currently at Costco do you have any tips
93:03 - my tips would be well I mean first of
93:06 - all times going to be an issue for sure
93:08 - because you're already working you have
93:11 - kids I'm gonna say I'm I'm 32 right now
93:16 - father of four so I understand the times
93:20 - gonna be an issue but I would say
93:23 - whenever you do have time work on
93:26 - projects work on tutorials your best
93:30 - thing that you can do to get a job and
93:32 - web dev is to have a good
93:34 - folio to actually work on projects have
93:37 - them on github have a nice portfolio
93:39 - site because that's going to be the
93:42 - number one thing that employers look for
93:44 - is you know can you do the job and you
93:49 - prove that by your projects that you've
93:51 - done so even if it's a side project do
93:53 - that if you can get somebody to pay you
93:55 - to do work do that too that's a great
93:58 - way to learn I mean I used when I was
94:01 - freelancing I used to take a lot of jobs
94:02 - sometimes jobs that were they didn't
94:05 - even pay that much but it was using
94:07 - something that I wanted to learn more
94:08 - about and so you take it you learn it
94:12 - you know while you're creating something
94:14 - and you make a little money and that
94:16 - makes it kind of easier when you have a
94:17 - family to justify spending that time
94:19 - away from your family you know because
94:21 - you are at least providing for them in
94:23 - some way so and in cases like that I
94:28 - just kind of saw myself as like I'm
94:31 - doing a paid internship right now I'm
94:33 - not making as much as I want to but I'm
94:35 - learning so I would consider myself in
94:38 - that position and mentally it just
94:40 - helped me to to work through that so I
94:44 - and I would say try to do a little bit
94:47 - every day so if you can go for a half
94:52 - hour or an hour of coding a little bit
94:56 - every day is is good you know try to get
94:58 - in like coding podcast when you're in
95:01 - the car or you know if I don't know when
95:04 - you're working out watch like a coding
95:06 - video I used to hold my kids and you
95:09 - know at nighttime they wouldn't sleep
95:10 - and I'd hold them and I'd rock them
95:12 - while I was watching something so you
95:15 - can watch tutorial videos like that yeah
95:19 - so just try to find those little ways
95:21 - but if you do a little every day that's
95:23 - much better than you know just saying
95:25 - like okay every Saturday I'm going to
95:26 - spend you know six hours doing it
95:29 - because you know by the time you get
95:32 - back around in the next Saturday you
95:33 - will have forgot a lot of what you would
95:35 - just learn so hopefully that those tips
95:39 - will help you
95:40 - I'm sure there's there's a lot of there
95:42 - you know good advice out there but
95:44 - that's what comes to mind
95:47 - you're right away and certainly if you
95:52 - can come back to the live chat ask you
95:54 - know ask any questions that you have you
95:57 - know I'd be happy to help and there are
95:58 - a lot of people to watch the chat that
96:00 - are you know more more advanced than me
96:02 - that can give you some great answers hey
96:06 - on LC how's it going
96:14 - Jay Frederic says what about moving the
96:18 - socialite comes to a position fix div on
96:20 - the side I thought about doing that I am
96:23 - I don't I don't really like to do the
96:30 - div on the side the dip on the side
96:33 - annoys me if it ends up blocking some
96:36 - element on the page and sometimes that
96:39 - happens now obviously if we were to do
96:40 - the bit on the side we would do what we
96:42 - could to make sure that that never
96:43 - happens
96:44 - but if I was going to move the social
96:47 - icon somewhere I guess I'd prefer to
96:49 - just move them down to the footer okay
96:59 - so Jay Fredrik says the nav section is a
97:03 - bit too crowded okay yeah maybe it is
97:12 - getting too crowded maybe we should just
97:13 - pull this stuff out I mean we could
97:15 - maybe we could do a whole row right here
97:20 - and just have one single row with this
97:23 - access fus your kind of button here you
97:28 - know in in its place here and just move
97:31 - everything up to be where these social
97:33 - icons were
97:38 - you know we could try like I said I have
97:40 - to talk to my boss before I make a
97:42 - change like that but we would definitely
97:47 - be able to get away with a much thinner
97:50 - header which I like
97:52 - I always like to have the the headers as
97:54 - thin as possible
98:04 - software dev says the menu in search box
98:06 - should be bigger Joey says the font
98:10 - looks a lot like spectral okay so I
98:12 - guess we're talking about this one the
98:17 - Joey says but then you would also have
98:18 - to load that extra font just for the few
98:20 - characters loading the logo might be
98:22 - better for performance you know what I
98:24 - didn't think about that but but you're
98:25 - right yeah I would rather not have to
98:28 - load an extra phone just for just for
98:31 - that little piece God so love 24 says
98:35 - yeah I agree with putting the social
98:37 - media icons at the bottom we'll have the
98:39 - search bar overlap the other tax law is
98:42 - selected okay so move the social media
98:46 - icons and then potentially have the
98:48 - search bar just overlap instead of
98:50 - pushing everything out of the way okay
98:54 - okay so Christopher said it is actually
98:57 - slow on a Samsung Chromebook plus okay
99:09 - okay hard saying is due to end Rock yeah
99:12 - that's actually that is a good thing to
99:14 - keep in mind so we're going to keep in
99:16 - mind that this is development build
99:18 - nothing is menifee nothing no images
99:24 - have even been optimized at all yet so
99:29 - in production the images would all be
99:32 - optimizing compressed we would be
99:36 - running a lot faster because we'd be in
99:39 - production build instead of dev dev mode
99:41 - and instead of running things off of my
99:45 - computer through Angra the servers are
99:47 - going to be running on much more speedy
99:52 - servers and yeah I think it'll I'm still
99:58 - I'm still open and that's definitely
100:00 - something that I'm gonna I'm going to
100:02 - test because I don't want bad
100:06 - performance through that but like I said
100:08 - I've used this on a lot of sites and
100:10 - I've never seen bad performance unless
100:12 - I've used it more than once on a page
100:21 - but I think that's something that we
100:23 - should definitely test before we launch
100:25 - on on old devices on different machines
100:29 - and things and that just see like is
100:32 - this something that we we definitely
100:34 - shouldn't do it Ishta meets says why are
100:44 - you using next yes when you could do
100:46 - server-side rendering using pure react
100:49 - and Express anode yeah well there's two
100:55 - answers that question one next also does
100:57 - come built-in with some other stuff
100:59 - that's nice to have so although we are
101:02 - doing a lot of custom routing with it
101:04 - next router is nice that's not really a
101:06 - big deal we could just use react router
101:08 - if we're using like create react app or
101:10 - something the other answer is I didn't
101:15 - have enough time to learn how to do that
101:16 - I've used necks before I'm familiar with
101:19 - it and I know we could do what we wanted
101:21 - but
101:23 - if if I would have had to have taken the
101:26 - time to learn how to do server-side
101:28 - rendering properly with reacts I I never
101:31 - could have made this as a deadline so
101:33 - the deadline for this was supposed to be
101:35 - the end of this month now it's gotten
101:39 - moved back not because we weren't ready
101:41 - but you know just for other reasons that
101:45 - had nothing to do with the coding so if
101:49 - it's going to get moved back a lot then
101:51 - we certainly would have had time but
101:53 - based on the time frame that I had for
101:55 - this site you know I I had to save time
102:02 - where I could save time and next is a
102:05 - nice a nice way to do that do
102:08 - server-side rendering without really
102:10 - having to to learn a lot about it it
102:14 - just works I would definitely like to
102:19 - know how to do it without having to use
102:21 - necks because sometimes I think next is
102:23 - overkill for some little things that I'm
102:25 - doing that I'd like to be server-side
102:27 - rendered so that's going to be something
102:30 - I'd like to learn how to do at some
102:31 - point but right now there's too much
102:35 - work to be done Michael so since you
102:40 - since you're going to be showing this
102:41 - you might want to delete two of the
102:44 - footer columns three makes it super long
102:47 - on mobile yeah you're right the I have
102:52 - three columns here maybe I should just
102:54 - put in the actual content that will be
102:58 - here that won't be too hard to do so
103:01 - we'll see depending on how much time I
103:03 - have I'll do that I don't I guess I
103:06 - don't really need to scroll the way down
103:08 - but that that's actually a good a good
103:11 - thing to do I mean yeah maybe I'll cut
103:14 - down the text significantly and then
103:17 - that way if I don't have time to put the
103:20 - real content here then it will look
103:23 - nicer so I like that idea Michael
103:30 - our Harrison said thanks yeah I get a
103:33 - again a 4 a.m. get up at 4:00 a.m. to
103:35 - code okay cool so Harrison was the one
103:38 - that was talking about changing you know
103:39 - careers into web dev yes yeah I find
103:44 - myself waking up earlier and earlier
103:45 - just to have a little bit of time like
103:47 - do a workout sometimes I code and so
103:51 - yeah I understand that
104:04 - our shits gonna leave AC arch I know it
104:08 - started to get late there it's a Tuesday
104:09 - already started alright well thanks
104:12 - thanks for coming a lot chatter they
104:14 - appreciate it Christopher said you
104:19 - should try aligning the mission summary
104:20 - div to the left and maybe confine it to
104:23 - the width of the video below it's yeah
104:33 - I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with this
104:35 - yet I kind of want to mess around with
104:42 - font sizes to make this bigger so it's
104:44 - supposed it's supposed to be a break a
104:48 - clear break between this section in this
104:51 - section so I like to keep it full width
104:53 - now keeping it full with having white
104:57 - space here and just cutting it down so
105:00 - that it does only take up half the space
105:02 - I'm definitely open to that that might
105:07 - look good to maybe I'll try that
105:21 - michael says since access FES is for
105:23 - faculty why not have it in the drop-down
105:25 - I thought this landing page was for
105:27 - prospective students it is it is for
105:31 - sure I have no idea why I'm being asked
105:33 - to put this up here to be honest with
105:35 - you I don't think it should be there
105:38 - I think we should have a donate button
105:40 - there because that's going to be the
105:44 - only other call-to-action we really want
105:46 - primarily we want students to apply or
105:50 - do one of these things and then
105:52 - secondarily this site is for donors to
105:55 - see what we're doing here and hopefully
105:57 - donate so I agree I do not think this
106:01 - should be there but that's not my call
106:04 - so maybe I'll bring it up again with my
106:07 - boss and and see why but you're entirely
106:12 - right there's yeah there's always been
106:18 - this weird thing since even before I got
106:20 - here there's been this weird thing where
106:22 - it's different departments have tried to
106:28 - get different content on the site that
106:29 - has nothing to do with prospective
106:31 - students and my boss has tried to keep
106:35 - this site more for prospective students
106:38 - but it's just been kind of like a back
106:41 - and forth you know like sometimes and
106:46 - I'm sure it's like this in other
106:47 - organizations if somebody high enough up
106:50 - with enough Authority says to do this
106:52 - sometimes you just do it you have to do
106:54 - it so sometimes that happened and you
106:58 - end up with just a lot of stuff so I'm
107:01 - really trying to right off the bat make
107:03 - this as clean and minimal as possible
107:05 - knowing that there's going to be a big
107:08 - push for people to want to get their
107:09 - content on the homepage really high up
107:13 - so this is one of those cases where
107:15 - we've already had had that happen yeah
107:21 - so for now this is here
107:34 - Harshit says will you use it-- now with
107:37 - CloudFlare for deployment
107:39 - then deployment will take ten minutes I
107:41 - guess it takes you four hours last time
107:45 - at digitalocean
107:47 - and I remind you to back up WordPress ok
107:50 - I did back at WordPress and I installed
107:52 - I have right now running like that
107:56 - weekly backups so I did get that up and
108:00 - running and yeah I I do want to start to
108:05 - look into different deployment options
108:06 - hard because you're right it did
108:08 - take a while to set up all the droplets
108:11 - before so yeah I'm definitely open to
108:16 - deployment options it basically it just
108:19 - needs to be reliable I don't want there
108:22 - to be any downtime for the users
108:24 - whenever I need to update things and I
108:28 - want it to be able to handle all the
108:29 - users that that were getting set said
108:43 - Chitra sorry if I'm mispronouncing that
108:46 - but just said shift row says highly
108:49 - appreciate what you're doing helped me
108:51 - to learn a lot of new things oh thank
108:53 - you for saying that
108:54 - thanks for watching I'm really glad that
108:56 - you you're able to learn some things
109:03 - okay I should say no downtime and
109:06 - insight you may be using oh yeah you did
109:11 - say now okay yeah I have used now before
109:15 - but it's been a WoW I think the last
109:18 - time I use now to deploy a site was in
109:20 - the summer of 2017 so it's been a long
109:23 - time so I want to read up on it more I'm
109:26 - sure there's a lot more features says
109:29 - you can scale a little balanced single
109:30 - command okay cool
109:32 - all right all right should I'm gonna
109:34 - read them more up on it this week is
109:35 - going to be crazy and I'm just going to
109:36 - be getting ready for my interview on
109:38 - Thursday and all my presentations so I'm
109:40 - probably not going to be able to look up
109:41 - anything I'm just going to be making
109:43 - small changes based on the audience for
109:46 - this site
109:47 - next week I'm hoping depending on all
109:51 - these go I may have even more
109:55 - presentations I'm not the one scheduling
109:58 - these my bosses are scheduling them for
110:00 - me so hopefully I'll be almost done two
110:02 - presentations and I can finally get back
110:04 - to like the normal work that we've been
110:06 - doing and at that point I really would
110:08 - like to look into deployment options and
110:12 - if I can get like a certain like a real
110:16 - date for when this needs to launch
110:18 - that'll also make a difference because
110:20 - then it may or may not be that important
110:23 - to look into deployment nikki says
110:34 - adding a subtle shadow to white text on
110:36 - a bright background makes it more
110:37 - readable it also makes it pop yeah we I
110:44 - do need to work on this text a bit to me
110:48 - I'll try that I usually try to stay away
110:50 - from from the shadows like like font
110:55 - shadows but I just kind of don't like
110:59 - the look of it but I do need to do
111:01 - something to make it readable okay all
111:06 - right should I won't forget to check the
111:08 - Twitter so I got Twitter open right now
111:09 - on my on my other screen so I won't
111:11 - forget to check so Nietzsche says just
111:16 - adding a text shadow and actually put
111:19 - the text shadow in here all right let's
111:22 - try this right now and see what the
111:24 - difference is let's try it out right
111:29 - here in in dev tools
111:48 - I'm not seeing a difference right now
111:50 - but that's probably because whatever is
111:52 - happening is blending into the shadow
111:54 - and actually I do so this text shadow
111:57 - actually matches the shadow I have the
112:01 - overlay I have over top of this image
112:04 - exactly so it's both point two I believe
112:07 - it's both point two so that's why it's
112:10 - not doing anything but if I lighten the
112:14 - background but keep the shadow on the
112:16 - text maybe maybe that would would work
112:20 - better Joey says you can also try adding
112:23 - a slightly more tinted box behind the
112:25 - text and buttons yeah I could do that I
112:27 - just style-wise I just don't like how it
112:30 - looks when I do that but I may have to
112:35 - it it entirely depends on what image we
112:38 - use and what are the colors in that
112:40 - image so that's going to be I'm kind of
112:49 - like shying away from doing too much
112:50 - because I'm not even sure this will be
112:52 - the image no one's seen this except for
112:54 - you all and me no one else at in my
112:57 - department has seen this so I don't know
112:59 - if they're gonna like it or not so I
113:02 - kind of like don't want to try to make
113:04 - this text do anything with this text
113:06 - really until I know for sure what's
113:08 - going to be the image we go with
113:16 - this is now that you have to do a
113:18 - presentation everyone's bringing up site
113:20 - redesign ideas we've been working on
113:22 - this one where we yeah today yet today
113:26 - was the day that like you all were just
113:28 - like hey let's change this let's change
113:29 - this let's change this I did wonder
113:32 - about that I'm kind of thinking like
113:34 - we've had the same thing up here for
113:36 - weeks and weeks and though it said
113:38 - anything and now today all of a sudden
113:40 - it's like yeah let's get rid of all this
113:42 - stuff I don't know but I I'm messing
113:45 - around now but I really appreciate all
113:46 - that stuff like even if you make a
113:48 - suggestion and I don't end up going with
113:50 - it I still appreciate it and it still
113:52 - may change or my design decisions down
113:55 - the road and other sites or other parts
113:58 - of the site so and sometimes it has
114:01 - nothing to do with whether or not your
114:02 - idea was a good idea it's other things
114:05 - it's like I know that if I do that
114:07 - this other person in that I work with is
114:10 - not gonna like it
114:11 - so like there's sometimes decisions for
114:15 - better for worse have to be made like
114:17 - that I can't always just say like what's
114:20 - going to be best for the design for the
114:22 - user or whatever so yeah so please you
114:27 - know keep the suggestions coming
114:30 - that's how sites that get better you
114:33 - know if I do something and it's ugly
114:35 - just telling me it's ugly you know I
114:37 - mean you could choose to be nice about
114:38 - it if you want which would be cool but
114:40 - even if you're not I'm okay with that
114:44 - so yeah and like like I said may or may
114:49 - not include it and that's not a
114:51 - reflection at all on you or your ideas
114:53 - there's just a lot of other factors that
114:55 - need to go into what I work on and when
114:57 - I work on it so anyway so I think we're
115:03 - gonna wrap things up soon there's a few
115:05 - more messages that just came in on live
115:06 - chat so I'm gonna go through those and
115:08 - then I'm gonna take a little break here
115:10 - and we'll see well I may not even have
115:14 - time to do that second stream like I was
115:16 - gonna do cuz it's already almost two
115:18 - will say yeah I don't know if I've time
115:21 - to do it or not you'll get a
115:22 - notification though if you're subscribed
115:24 - to my my channel let's see
115:35 - Nietzsche says here's the threat of
115:36 - awesome UI details oh cool thanks sneaky
115:43 - Biff BAFF says do you use color pattern
115:48 - sites for designing sometimes I look at
115:51 - those sites for sites that I make for
115:54 - the University I I have to stick with
116:00 - our color palette for university so I
116:02 - have very little leeway and deviating
116:05 - from that color palette but for sites
116:07 - that I'm doing on my own or like a lot
116:10 - of times clients businesses already have
116:12 - a certain color palette but if I do have
116:14 - freedom I do try to go on sites and just
116:16 - get ideas for different color palettes
116:20 - and things that's one of the things it
116:21 - takes me forever like to pick colors but

117:38 - learned what I needed to learn to get
117:40 - the job done I have done some like
117:45 - Udacity courses so done free code camp
117:50 - things but yeah but design wise very
117:53 - little design stuff I definitely would
117:56 - would say I'm a developer I have to do
117:58 - design here when when in because there's
118:01 - not really a web designer you know here
118:04 - at the University so I try to use
118:07 - material design and fall back on that as
118:10 - much as possible you know because I know
118:12 - I'm lacking in you know that design
118:15 - knowledge but yeah so no formal design

118:59 - much all of my my learning for becoming
119:03 - a web developer has been on my own
119:05 - almost entirely through free resources

119:35 - stuff trying to think I've tried a lot
119:40 - of other things but those are the main
119:41 - ones that I kind of stuck with and did
119:43 - the most work with those like online
