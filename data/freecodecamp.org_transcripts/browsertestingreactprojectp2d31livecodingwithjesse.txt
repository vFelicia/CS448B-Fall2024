00:07 - hey everybody its Jesse and today we're
00:12 - gonna do something a little bit
00:12 - different so yesterday we worked on just
00:18 - some styling things and I haven't had a
00:20 - chance yet to do anything else
00:22 - with the styles since yesterday
00:25 - afternoon so I don't have any updates
00:27 - when it comes to that what I did do
00:30 - though is I have a server completely up
00:34 - and running and I have a version of the
00:40 - resource center project that we've been
00:41 - working on now live and so what I
00:46 - thought we could do today is I want to
00:49 - go through check it out in a browser
00:53 - first I'm just gonna click around you
00:55 - know in Chrome and see see what happens
00:59 - we'll resize the screen maybe open up a
01:02 - few other browsers and you all will be
01:05 - able to go through the site with you
01:09 - know whatever setup that you have I know
01:11 - I'm on a Mac right now and there's
01:15 - certainly going to be some of you on
01:16 - Windows and I know a few of you are on
01:18 - on Linux systems so in the past we've
01:22 - had you know very different experiences
01:26 - depending on our combination of
01:27 - operating system you know browser or
01:29 - device so I thought it'd be nice to just
01:32 - go through and try to figure out you
01:35 - know if anything just looks really weird
01:37 - or is you know kind of acting
01:39 - differently than it should and see if we
01:41 - can we can fix that you know at the very
01:44 - least you know it'd be nice to just get
01:49 - a list of things that that need to be
01:52 - the need to be fixed so I will say this
01:57 - the forms are not working right now so I
02:01 - already know that so if you try to
02:03 - submit something through the forms
02:04 - they're not working and I've left the
02:07 - error message up here basically what's
02:10 - happening is it's trying
02:15 - it's trying to send the form data to
02:19 - http and then our C Francisquito
02:23 - University and then port 9000 slash
02:27 - uploads so obviously this is a
02:28 - ridiculous URL this is not where you
02:30 - want to send it so I'm gonna work on
02:35 - that the problems in the service dog a.s
02:40 - are yeah the service center
02:44 - I'm sorry service requests today s is
02:49 - the component where the issues had so
02:51 - I've done a few things already to try to
02:54 - correct it obviously it hasn't worked
02:56 - it's a little tricky because I have to
02:58 - make the changes push them to get out
02:59 - pull it down to the server rebuild it
03:01 - and then test it again so it's not the
03:04 - the fastest way to do things so I think
03:07 - I'm just going to think about this for a
03:08 - little bit instead of changing little
03:09 - things and trying again and again and
03:11 - again since the you know the feedback
03:13 - loop is you're not quite as tight as it
03:16 - normally is when we're developing
03:17 - locally okay so let me just let me say
03:28 - hide everyone to check the live chat
03:30 - really quick I do have one question
03:39 - Saran Saran CH says what's this soft on
03:45 - the screen though you mean what what
03:50 - software is on the screen I'm not
03:51 - exactly sure I understand the question
03:53 - this is just chrome dev tools right now
03:56 - and I'm running the dark theme so it's
03:59 - not it looks different than the default
04:03 - so let's go over let me bring over the
04:09 - the actual site you can see there's some
04:13 - things like this page the letterhead
04:15 - page obviously I haven't finished this
04:18 - yet so I need I just need to put in the
04:23 - data for this
04:25 - so not really a big deal I just keep
04:29 - forgetting to do that I do want to show
04:32 - so you can see this this page is exactly
04:34 - you know how we left it off we already
04:37 - spent a bunch of time on this page
04:38 - earlier so I'm not even really gonna
04:40 - test this out there's not much I mean I
04:43 - guess we can we can check this out and
04:46 - see how it looks on a smaller screen and
04:50 - you know that's that's fine that's what
04:54 - it's kind of nice about using some sort
04:56 - of CSS framework especially for a grid
04:59 - system is that it's normally very
05:01 - consistent you you don't you don't see
05:05 - as many bugs like if you try to do your
05:07 - own you know from scratch it's been my
05:10 - experience at least that it um if
05:12 - there's it's way more likely that
05:13 - there's gonna be some bugs if I try to
05:16 - do it completely on my own but if I
05:19 - bring in at least some elements from an
05:21 - existing system that's used by a lot of
05:23 - people and it has been tested it's you
05:27 - know you can reasonably expect that it's
05:29 - gonna act how you how you want it to act
05:31 - I do want to check this out because we
05:33 - haven't we haven't really done much with
05:36 - this since we've set it up I don't even
05:39 - remember the last time I looked at this
05:40 - page so it looks like you know we see we
05:45 - see all the logos that's fine
05:48 - this is working that's great
05:54 - [Music]
05:56 - getting a phone call but that is some
05:59 - type of solicitor some representative
06:04 - from some company keeps trying to get me
06:05 - to have a meeting and they call me every
06:07 - day and send me emails I can't even
06:10 - remember what their company does but for
06:12 - some reason people think I have
06:14 - decision-making abilities and the
06:16 - ability to buy things and I really don't
06:19 - I mean I just I build the websites I can
06:22 - make recommendations to people higher up
06:24 - but oh so let's check that out
06:28 - not not really a browser specific thing
06:31 - but don't want that color there in the
06:37 - drop-down so
06:38 - let's check that out now so I figure on
06:43 - normally if I was going to do testing I
06:45 - would just when I saw something I would
06:46 - just write it down I put it my Trello
06:48 - board and then go back to it but that's
06:50 - gonna be I think somewhat boring to do
06:54 - so what I'm gonna do now is if I see
06:57 - something I figured like let's just
06:59 - we'll dive right in
07:00 - we'll try to figure out what's going on
07:02 - and fix it so we may not get through
07:04 - everything you know in terms of testing
07:06 - but I think it'll make for a much better
07:10 - stream in terms of viewing experience
07:15 - much better than just watching me click
07:17 - around on the site so let's check out
07:21 - let's see this is I'm assuming that we
07:27 - just use the the select input from did
07:35 - we do so selected we do a drop-down
07:37 - let's just check out this this page and
07:40 - see what we use because I'm guessing
07:41 - there's probably some prop we can pass
07:46 - in that will change this color if that's
07:50 - the case then that'll be really easy if
07:55 - that's not the case this may actually be
07:57 - a color right now let me check this out
08:04 - I just said I had an idea we have a
08:12 - custom theme somewhere I don't think I
08:20 - have it up already
08:29 - see there you go it's in the components
08:32 - holder so we have this custom theme and
08:35 - I'm so I'm guessing that that's this
08:36 - pink color here and see we are using it
08:39 - as an accent color so let's get rid of
08:41 - that color and let's put in as the
08:44 - accent color that let's put in that
08:48 - yellow that we've been using elsewhere
08:51 - and as I mentioned yesterday if we're
08:56 - using sass it's better to do variables I
08:59 - haven't really taken the time to set up
09:01 - my color variables and things and import
09:03 - them correctly so this is one of those
09:06 - cases where it's like yes this works but
09:08 - this is definitely not the best way to
09:10 - do it in terms of organization this
09:14 - could be a lot better but for now let's
09:18 - switch out this pink I think that's the
09:22 - only color that really needs you know
09:25 - everything else is somewhat neutral
09:27 - right we have different Gray's black
09:29 - white I'm okay with that
09:31 - but obviously that pink is not it's not
09:33 - in the color palette for to the
09:36 - University so that should work and then
09:41 - now we don't need this pink so we could
09:42 - take that out as well and now let's see
09:47 - what we have here hmm do a hard refresh
09:55 - hmm has it changed
10:05 - maybe it's somewhere else oh I don't
10:14 - know what I was thinking obviously it
10:17 - wouldn't change it we're checking the I
10:19 - was checking on the live version so let
10:23 - me click whoops I didn't put this in in
10:30 - quotes so so this is the local version
10:38 - so we should see the changes reflected
10:40 - immediately here so let's check it out
10:43 - all right great so now we have that
10:45 - color I'm not a hundred percent sure
10:48 - this is the color I want here but at
10:49 - least it's a color that's on the
10:51 - official color palette for the
10:52 - University so it'll be all right it does
10:55 - match you know what we have here so I'm
10:59 - okay with that for right now let's keep
11:04 - going and I do want to check the I want
11:08 - to do the checks on the live version
11:13 - alright let's see yeah those links look
11:16 - good
11:19 - so our logos page is good on our posters
11:22 - page so on this page we had the same
11:25 - issue that we have the home page in that
11:27 - you know we have a few cards here and we
11:31 - have it vertically aligned to be in the
11:34 - center yesterday when we worked on it on
11:37 - the home page you know we we tried it
11:40 - out being not vertically centered and it
11:43 - was you know obviously it looked better
11:45 - so I think we should probably do that
11:49 - here as well there's enough content here
11:53 - and a little bit of color with these
11:54 - links I don't think we need to add that
11:56 - that little kind of bar with the accent
12:00 - color that we did on the home page let
12:01 - me know what you all think though
12:03 - because you know we might want to do
12:08 - that
12:10 - I don't know I don't I guess I could see
12:14 - going both ways we could have
12:16 - consistency by doing it or you know it
12:20 - could be overdoing it if we use it for
12:23 - everything but for now at least I do
12:25 - want to move this up so that instead of
12:30 - being vertically centered it's just at
12:31 - the top all the time so let's do that
12:33 - now
12:35 - pages this posters and I forgot to set
12:40 - my timer oops
12:42 - of it on the other page let's set my
12:44 - timer and that would be a good time to
12:49 - explain what's going on for anybody
12:51 - that's that's new to hey everybody and
12:55 - EMS are you using web Pappa web pack I
12:59 - am using webpack but I'm using create
13:01 - react apps so they took care of all the
13:02 - web pack config so I don't I haven't
13:05 - done anything with the config to
13:07 - customize it but behind the scenes web
13:10 - pack is doing a lot of stuff
13:21 - all right so for anybody that's that's
13:25 - new if you haven't seen any Austrians
13:27 - before this is me doing my everyday work
13:30 - so it's not not really a tutorial
13:33 - although I try to explain things as best
13:35 - I can so some of the work gets done in
13:38 - between streams and I try to catch
13:40 - everybody up on what I've done the way I
13:45 - break up the stream is that I use a
13:47 - Pomodoro timer so it's a 25-minute
13:50 - session of coding or whatever we happen
13:52 - to be working on and then five minutes I
13:54 - go back to the live chat and I answer
13:56 - any questions that anybody's posted in
13:59 - the live chat then we do another
14:00 - 25-minute session I like to do at least
14:02 - two sessions per stream sometimes more
14:05 - today I think I'm gonna keep it a
14:07 - shorter stream because I I'm still just
14:14 - not feeling well I have a sore throat I
14:16 - don't want to lose my voice and I really
14:20 - have a lot of work that I need to get to
14:23 - I want to get that service request form
14:25 - working but I'm also I have that if
14:28 - you've been watching you know that I
14:29 - have that Udacity react nano degree that
14:32 - I'm working on and there's a project due
14:34 - soon I need to double-check but I'm
14:36 - pretty sure I have until September 15th
14:38 - if anybody's in that course and I have
14:40 - the the date wrong let me know although
14:42 - it depends on when you signed up I guess
14:45 - but I need the project the project needs
14:48 - done so I really need to get to work on
14:50 - that as well but in any case we get in
14:54 - to Pomodoro sessions and then at the end
14:56 - whenever I'm done with the coding I
14:59 - answer any questions there in the live
15:01 - chat I almost always get a chance to
15:04 - answer every question occasionally for
15:07 - if there's something like a meeting I
15:09 - have and I really have to cut it short I
15:11 - won't get to them all but I would say
15:13 - you know 99% of the time I get to all
15:15 - the questions so if I don't get to your
15:18 - question right away if you can stick
15:19 - around till the end I will answer it all
15:22 - right so let's start this up we'll go in
15:25 - here to the posters jazz component and
15:28 - you can see all this code on github
15:31 - so there's a link in the description
15:34 - we're on the master branch right now so
15:37 - you've if you want to follow along or
15:39 - see how the how the code works you can
15:41 - go there feel free to clone the project
15:43 - if you want to use it if you just want
15:46 - to mess around with it or use some of it
15:48 - as a base as a basis for your own
15:51 - project or if you'd like to submit a
15:54 - pull request to this project that's
15:56 - that's awesome you know feel free to use
15:58 - any of it I mean obviously you can't use
16:00 - the University logo I don't have
16:04 - permission to let's use that as well but
16:06 - all the code you can certainly use
16:09 - however you want to use it okay posters
16:26 - thanks I think we can get rid of this so
16:28 - we did have a logos posters view and I
16:34 - think we can get rid of this because
16:37 - we're not gonna use that now we set
16:38 - things up differently so let's just
16:40 - delete that while we're in here and we
16:42 - already have enough going on with all
16:43 - our file structure we don't need to keep
16:46 - in things that aren't doing anything
16:48 - right now okay so in our posters this
16:54 - should be a really easy fix
16:56 - let's find our container here we go if
17:05 - we remove this class of the line wrapper
17:09 - right this is the class that's giving us
17:11 - our vertical alignment and we've
17:14 - imported this you know we brought it
17:16 - over from materialized CSS so we're not
17:19 - using the entire framework mainly
17:22 - because it's a lot of it is based on
17:25 - jQuery I don't want to use jQuery with
17:27 - react for various reasons that we've
17:30 - gone over and previous streams if you
17:32 - really want to know the reasons ask me
17:34 - in the live chat and I'll explain it on
17:36 - one of the breaks but there are some
17:40 - really helpful things in materialized
17:43 - that we brought over so the grid system
17:46 - they're responsive font sizes and also
17:49 - this vertical align alignment class that
17:53 - uses flex behind the scenes there so if
17:57 - we take that out that should fix our
17:59 - alignment let's I keep forgetting that
18:03 - we're no I guess I shouldn't have
18:10 - removed that so I deleted that file but
18:13 - I must be using it somewhere let's see
18:14 - where
18:21 - what is going on
18:31 - I need to figure out why let me try
18:37 - restarting the server before I go in and
18:40 - start doing anything else
18:53 - see if we get the same error or not
19:01 - I think we are yep we are okay so it
19:04 - looks like it's a little bit here we go
19:07 - routes that's what I wanted to say I
19:10 - thought it was in routes but better to
19:13 - just kind of wait and see what line is
19:18 - that does it say alright it's not
19:21 - telling me a line but let's check out
19:25 - our he said routes component let me
19:39 - there we go raus and let's remove that
19:43 - [Applause]
19:45 - from logos posters let's get rid of that
19:49 - and see if we have it anywhere else
19:53 - them as posters yeah we don't need that
19:56 - here either okay so that should work now
20:10 - great all right so let's check out that
20:13 - posters page see there you go now we
20:17 - don't have that vertical alignment so I
20:21 - am going to check in the lab check
20:22 - because I asked about the the styles for
20:25 - this I'm gonna see if anyone has any
20:28 - opinions on that also I forgot to
20:30 - mention to anyone watching on Instagram
20:32 - if you want to see the code that I'm
20:36 - working on right now that you can you
20:38 - can kind of see the edge of the screen
20:39 - there a little bit but if you want to be
20:42 - able to get a better view of the code
20:43 - check out the free code camp YouTube
20:47 - channel I'm live right now if you see
20:49 - the recording of this then the recording
20:51 - will be available the title of this
20:53 - stream or this this video is browser
20:59 - testing react projects and I should have
21:03 - I should have put browser testing a
21:06 - react project I guess it doesn't really
21:10 - matter I just it's hard for me to come
21:14 - up with titles sometimes but anyway
21:17 - it'll be browser testing and that's
21:19 - project 2 day 31 of live coding with
21:22 - Jesse so if you're watching on free code
21:27 - camp right now then in the end you want
21:32 - to see see me while I code you can check
21:35 - out the Instagram the links in the
21:36 - description for the video so it looks
21:39 - like John Hanson says consistency of
21:42 - design is always good yeah yeah we
21:47 - definitely could let me see how this
21:48 - looks again
21:54 - here's what I'm I'm kind of torn though
21:58 - because on the home page these are all
22:00 - really links I mean it's not like the on
22:04 - the interior pages these are more
22:05 - informational blocks of text so they do
22:08 - have a different function I mean some of
22:09 - these are lengths but functionally these
22:13 - cards are different so I think we have a
22:15 - reason to treat them differently I'm you
22:21 - know I think it works with these cards
22:23 - they're very small
22:25 - I just am worried that it'll be too much
22:28 - on these larger cards I'm gonna think
22:33 - about it we'll go on and check out some
22:34 - of the other pages I'm gonna think about
22:35 - it if you all have any opinions on
22:37 - whether or not we should put a colored
22:40 - border on the left of these cards let me
22:43 - know in the live chat please but I see
22:49 - video tutorials oh yeah let's not forget
22:51 - this page so this page has tutorial
22:54 - videos yeah I think this is fine there's
23:02 - not really much to do on this page just
23:05 - needs to display the videos one thing I
23:10 - think I do want to do to keep things
23:12 - consistent is have a title on every page
23:16 - right now only some of the pages have
23:18 - the title so I think it would be nice to
23:22 - have the title here for each page or at
23:25 - least something here for each page so
23:30 - let me go back and see I'm okay with not
23:33 - having it here for logos because we have
23:35 - this this menu here so I don't really
23:40 - want to add another thing here
23:48 - yeah so we should put I should put
23:52 - letterhead here as a title at the top
23:57 - yeah let's do that now let me see how I
24:02 - did this in posters okay I just had it
24:07 - had a div that's h2 and Pedro says
24:20 - letterhead
24:29 - so it might be a bit too small to see
24:33 - but over here in our all our folders
24:38 - here all each page is its own component
24:40 - in the views folder so you have them
24:43 - separated out from the rest of the
24:44 - components and there pretty much all of
24:47 - them are named the same name as the
24:50 - title of that page we also have all of
24:54 - our tests that we're running for the
24:57 - pages there with within the views folder
25:00 - as well
25:03 - okay so let's throw in let's try to put
25:08 - that in right here and see what it looks
25:11 - like
25:14 - letterhead I don't think we need this
25:17 - flex here I think that was necessary
25:20 - when we were doing the vertical
25:22 - alignment I don't think it is anymore
25:24 - we'll find out
25:27 - okay so we have letterhead what's
25:30 - different we have a different class
25:33 - going on here flow text okay so let's
25:41 - let's add the flow text class here
25:50 - and this is that responsive font font
25:55 - size class that I was talking about a
25:57 - few minutes ago that we brought in from
25:59 - materialized so all this does is it
26:02 - changes the font size based on screen
26:05 - width so if you add that here we're
26:09 - gonna end up with there we go so end up
26:12 - with a larger header a larger heading
26:16 - and then we also have larger text here I
26:23 - don't know that I like how much space is
26:29 - there let's see yeah we definitely don't
26:35 - have nearly as much space here so let's
26:37 - get rid of some of the space
26:39 - let's see where that's coming from
26:51 - so I guess this Pete yeah I think if we
26:57 - just get rid of the margin that should
27:04 - be good yeah that looks a lot better
27:06 - that's more reasonable
27:08 - we could probably shorten that gap even
27:11 - more but I think that's I think that
27:16 - looks all right so let's do that in this
27:18 - case I like to put a style like this
27:20 - directly on this age tag if I find on
27:26 - some other pages I need to do something
27:28 - similar then I may think about just kind
27:30 - of globally doing this but I'd rather
27:34 - not put a style directly I'd rather not
27:37 - set a global style for an age tag like
27:40 - that because we may use this in other
27:41 - places and so I just don't want to
27:45 - inadvertently mess up Styles elsewhere
27:47 - but in react we can use styles in line
27:53 - let me do it a little bit differently
27:55 - than you normally would in HTML so we
27:59 - have our Styles you know like normal or
28:02 - styles property but then we put these
28:05 - curly brackets the first set of brackets
28:09 - means that we're gonna do some
28:11 - JavaScript inside of here the second set
28:13 - just makes an object right like normally
28:17 - if we're doing JavaScript brackets or an
28:20 - object right and then we can write
28:25 - let's see Louie De Marchi and bottom
28:27 - there so we can do margin-bottom camel
28:30 - cased not hyphenated like we normally do
28:34 - in CSS so you do that camel case just
28:37 - like a normal object we're going to put
28:38 - our colon and then we're gonna put our
28:40 - value I'm gonna put 0 pixels here I
28:44 - think it would work
28:47 - let's just try it out just for a
28:49 - demonstration here since it's just a
28:51 - numerical value if I put the zero it
28:53 - should work even if it's not in in
28:57 - quotation marks maybe it didn't work
29:02 - all right let's try this again so this
29:05 - was good I thought it would work
29:07 - although I'd never tried it so let's try
29:09 - this again let's try it like this
29:18 - hmm did it not work either way I could
29:22 - be that
29:29 - hmm
29:35 - oops I put an S there I'm sure you all
29:41 - caught that sorry about that okay so
29:44 - that worked here now now I'm really
29:46 - curious I do actually want to see if
29:47 - this works with just us here okay and in
29:53 - fact it does work right so normally when
29:58 - you do styles like this you have to put
30:00 - that bat value as a string right you
30:05 - have to put it in in quotes or the back
30:08 - take if you're gonna do a template
30:10 - literal something like that but if the
30:14 - value is just numerical then you can put
30:18 - that in and it works as well okay great
30:22 - so this is looking better as I said I
30:27 - think this is the first page I had up on
30:29 - the screen when we first started
30:31 - checking there's a lot more than he's
30:33 - done on this page and if we get through
30:35 - everything else we may come back to this
30:37 - and just start start changing some
30:40 - things on here but for now I'm gonna
30:44 - move on because what I'm looking for
30:47 - mostly right now is you know kind of
30:51 - really obvious things that need change
30:55 - you know padding things things like that
30:59 - I really actually I really don't like
31:02 - how this card title is up here without
31:06 - any padding but we're not gonna use the
31:08 - card title so I'm not gonna worry about
31:12 - it right now I just have to keep that in
31:13 - mind later on if we if we do end up
31:15 - using a card with this this title here
31:19 - okay let's check out our share story
31:23 - page okay that looks good we don't have
31:29 - a title here so let's put that in I
31:35 - think I'll just call it
31:40 - hmm sorry is yawning yeah let's put in a
31:49 - heading but just says shared story I
31:53 - wanna I can't remember what I call it on
31:54 - the homepage suggest the story yeah
32:04 - maybe I'll put suggestive story since
32:10 - that's how I have it here okay so let's
32:16 - just bring in let's copy what we have
32:19 - here and we'll put that in story so
32:31 - we're in the story j/s component right
32:33 - now and we have more more than usual
32:41 - going on in this component since we have
32:42 - a form here and we have to handle that
32:44 - form data but for this we don't need to
32:51 - change mas it's just a story
33:07 - all right let's check it out whoops and
33:10 - let's move this flow text up to the
33:14 - container div
33:23 - there we go
33:27 - all right and I want to shrink this down
33:29 - just to see how this looks okay
33:38 - no bad I'm kind of I don't really know
33:43 - what I can do about it right now but I
33:46 - mean let's think if this was really
33:48 - somebody's fun they're only gonna see
33:49 - this at first I think I have to scroll
33:51 - down before they get to the forum I can
33:55 - see that as being somewhat annoying
33:56 - especially if someone has already gone
33:58 - through all this you know several times
34:01 - it's not a long scroll I don't know that
34:09 - it would really look right though if I
34:10 - just had the form first and then the
34:12 - explanation under that so I guess it'll
34:18 - have to be like this for now to be
34:21 - honest though very few people access the
34:25 - current version of this right now on
34:26 - their phones and this suggests a story
34:29 - form is rarely used I mean where I would
34:34 - be surprised if it's been used more than
34:36 - a dozen times in the last year so
34:38 - probably shouldn't put too much thought
34:40 - into this right now
34:42 - because it it really won't be seen by
34:46 - that many people and it'll be used by
34:47 - even you know fewer people
34:50 - all right let's share the service
34:52 - request form now we do have some stuff
34:54 - going on here that we need to think
34:57 - about you know fixing I haven't looked
35:01 - at it on a more narrow screen yet okay
35:04 - not bad so you can see right away
35:08 - there's some some things going on with
35:10 - spacing here like are are checkboxes
35:15 - that have icons have a ton of space
35:20 - between them we need to fix that and
35:23 - make it consistent with the rest of the
35:26 - checkboxes I don't love the fact that
35:31 - this goes down onto another line but it
35:33 - actually lines up with this button
35:36 - somewhat so I'm not
35:40 - I'm not really that worried about it hmm
35:48 - this completion date line doesn't go all
35:51 - the way to the end although we certainly
35:54 - don't need that space for a date it
35:57 - would look more consistent if this went
35:59 - full width so maybe it will do that all
36:03 - right so right away we need to work on
36:05 - these check boxes you know possibly we
36:08 - need to make this a bit bigger you know
36:11 - full width and we do have some issues
36:14 - where okay so on the when these are full
36:22 - with this works but look what happens
36:26 - whenever we go up like this all right so
36:34 - you see it messes up a lot of what's
36:38 - going on here so let me let me go back
36:43 - out here right so our project
36:45 - description is here in this side but if
36:48 - I put the wrong value in there the
36:50 - project description actually even flips
36:51 - to the other side now so at first I
36:56 - didn't notice this it was earlier today
36:57 - that I first noticed is that not only do
37:00 - we have more space here but it's
37:01 - actually flipping the order around so we
37:07 - definitely want to figure out what's
37:08 - going on here and fix that so that it
37:14 - doesn't change the order that's probably
37:19 - the checkbox spacing in this are gonna
37:22 - be the number one number one and two
37:25 - priorities on this page let me go back I
37:30 - did ask a few questions about you know
37:33 - your opinions actually I have three
37:36 - minutes yeah I'll just work on this for
37:40 - a little bit and then on the 5-minute
37:41 - break I'll go back and check out what
37:43 - you all thought about the few things
37:45 - that I'd asked
37:51 - let's see let's let's check out this
37:55 - first I'm just I'm really curious about
37:57 - it I want to see what's going on to move
38:01 - this over a bit so we can see okay so
38:09 - here's our our Colin
38:34 - okay so something's going on I guess
38:40 - inside there is no difference to this
38:42 - you know container this column class
38:44 - that should be separating these properly
38:58 - I guess we do have this added
39:16 - see what it what it looks like
39:37 - okay so definitely think the issue is
39:40 - with this div this is the only thing
39:43 - that's really changing I mean other
39:45 - other than the the color of this border
39:48 - underneath let's see
40:32 - okay
40:34 - all right so nothing so far just kind of
40:37 - messing around in in dev tools trying to
40:40 - change the display value and things
40:44 - position I guess may yeah certainly
40:57 - if we change the position to absolute
41:10 - this would work right so
41:18 - I'm CEO this okay that's really tight
41:33 - that's not a way
41:37 - although actually if you made it tight
41:40 - like that I don't mind that
41:43 - okay so potentially if we changed it
41:46 - from position relative to position
41:48 - absolute set the value for bottom to 15
41:52 - actually let's get rid of that and then
41:54 - we can just set this value for the
41:56 - bottom to eight negative eight pixels
42:01 - and I think that works there's a little
42:04 - bit of space here it should work as long
42:10 - as this doesn't bleed over on a second
42:13 - line which would just have to test and
42:15 - see if that would would happen thinking
42:17 - would probably only happen on a smaller
42:19 - screen so we could do this in a media
42:22 - query that way it'll behave normally on
42:29 - a small screen
42:33 - let's try that we'll try would I just
42:36 - done here and we'll try to apply it to
42:37 - everything and just kind of click around
42:40 - and mess with it on different screen
42:42 - sizes and see if it works I'm okay with
42:45 - this right now I know the spacing is a
42:47 - little bit tight but you know hopefully
42:49 - you know people won't even see this that
42:51 - often right they'll type things
42:54 - correctly and in fact I think this looks
42:57 - fine and if I hadn't have first seen it
43:00 - with more spacing in between here I
43:03 - probably wouldn't really think that much
43:05 - about it all right my timer did go off
43:11 - so I'm gonna set my five-minute timer
43:15 - now go back to live chat answer any
43:17 - questions you have and see what what
43:19 - your opinions are on what we've been
43:21 - doing so far
43:32 - all right have some people kind of
43:35 - shouting out where they're from
43:36 - so from South Africa Africa Ukraine
43:41 - Ghana awesome welcome so awesome
43:47 - everyone's watching from all over the
43:48 - place okay who's this no Peter's saying
44:01 - expend a little more to the div element
44:03 - it's more suitable to your screen I'm
44:05 - not sure what I was looking at when you
44:07 - said that if I had to guess I'm thinking
44:11 - maybe you were talking about the
44:13 - homepage cards maybe you make them a
44:16 - little bit bigger anyway no beer let me
44:18 - know would you or when you were thinking
44:22 - because that was about yeah that was a
44:26 - while ago for that comment so I I had
44:29 - scrolled back up to the top of the live
44:31 - chat and I'm working my way down Frank
44:40 - asked how do you move that window from
44:42 - side to side is it a Mac yes it's
44:45 - because I'm on a Mac so I can you know
44:47 - have multiple so I've like multiple
44:51 - desktops right and I can switch between
44:53 - them
44:54 - so for each I'm running three screens
44:56 - right now so you only see one of my
44:57 - screens but for each screen I have
44:59 - multiple desktops and can switch between
45:01 - them so it's really useful especially if
45:05 - you're consistent and then you kind of
45:09 - memorize where everything's at and I can
45:10 - flip between things pretty quickly and
45:15 - it's all just hand gestures so if I use
45:17 - three fingers and I swipe then it it
45:21 - goes and goes between them so it took a
45:25 - little while to get used to but now it's
45:26 - definitely more efficient to do things
45:30 - that way Raina's says congrats on
45:34 - working on your nano degree Thanks
45:37 - yeah hopefully I get the nanodegree to
45:40 - be honest with you this the first
45:42 - project was okay
45:43 - I did I did decent job on it you know I
45:45 - I passed the second project now is
45:50 - having to do with redux and I've never
45:52 - used redux before so that's been a lot
45:55 - more difficult for me the first project
45:58 - was just react react the router stuff
46:01 - that you know we're using on this
46:03 - project so it was a lot easier but I'm
46:07 - struggling a bit with this one so I need
46:09 - to really I'm actually considering
46:11 - taking a day off of work to work on my
46:15 - project hopefully I won't I won't have
46:17 - to do that but I'll be spending a lot of
46:20 - time probably Saturday probably most of
46:23 - the day Saturday this week working on it
46:25 - okay cool so Umberto says in regard to
46:34 - that this you know flipping between the
46:36 - desktops that you can actually do it on
46:38 - Windows 10 I was not aware of that I
46:41 - haven't I have a few computers running
46:44 - Windows 10 at home and but I haven't
46:46 - really done much with them for a long
46:48 - time so I have to try that cool thanks
46:52 - for mentioning that Umberto
47:13 - okay here's a good so CF coder 2 says I
47:18 - would encourage you to include a left
47:20 - edge color bar you can perhaps code
47:23 - color code each category of your site so
47:26 - when we're talking about I'll show you
47:30 - on this this one so I don't mess up I'm
47:33 - doing here dev tools so like putting a
47:36 - color bar here we could have different
47:40 - colors for each each section I don't
47:45 - have to think about that because we do
47:48 - have a few other colors in the color
47:50 - palette that we haven't even used it all
47:51 - yet I'll think about that
48:02 - nobody says nice-looking header Thanks
48:07 - thank you appreciate it and Frank also
48:11 - says pretty hot header thank you
48:19 - cf coder says is there a reason not to
48:21 - use a class on the h2 tag no not I mean
48:28 - we could definitely use a class on the
48:29 - h2 tag to do what we're doing initially
48:32 - I thought well if I'm just gonna do it
48:35 - for this page I'm gonna do the inline
48:37 - Styles and I could always change it to a
48:41 - class if I end up doing it a lot I ended
48:43 - up doing it a few times so might not be
48:45 - a bad idea to just add a class to that
48:51 - to that age tag so yeah maybe we'll add
48:54 - a class on there I'm trying to think of
49:01 - what I would I mean really I could add a
49:03 - class called no bottom margin and then
49:07 - that that's really all we're doing so it
49:11 - could be a utility class I almost hate
49:13 - to add a class just for that because
49:17 - it's it's only saving a few characters
49:21 - from actually doing the inline style so
49:23 - often I think now that I think about it
49:25 - I don't even I don't know if it would be
49:28 - worth it if I added some more to that
49:31 - class it might be worth it but I don't
49:33 - know I know there's a lot of different
49:34 - ideas about how to do CSS how to
49:38 - organize classes and things like that so
49:41 - I don't really want to get into all
49:45 - those differences right now as you can
49:47 - see there's not set sorry to say but
49:51 - there's not that much logic to what's
49:53 - going on with my sass files right now so
49:58 - they've been kind of like an
50:00 - afterthought and just throwing in some
50:02 - Styles here and there where I need them
50:03 - I haven't really taken a good approach
50:05 - to organizing it yet
50:15 - let's see alright my timers up so let me
50:19 - just I'm actually really close to the
50:22 - bottom of the live shot let me just take
50:23 - a few more I did go over a little bit on
50:25 - my first 25 minutes so let me just get
50:29 - to the bottom here this live chat since
50:31 - there's not much left let's see no beer
50:40 - says I'm curious about your shared story
50:42 - page how do you in that in in the input
50:48 - area when input is focused it exactly
50:51 - works like YouTube live chat or Gmail
50:54 - login page how do you do it can you
50:56 - explain okay yeah for sure I'll go over
50:59 - that I'll go over that in a second
51:04 - actually whenever we get back to this
51:06 - because that is kind of a cool a cool
51:08 - way to do it Frank also said can I use
51:14 - some of this logic and logic in my
51:16 - project yeah for sure you use any you
51:19 - know whatever stuff in the in the code
51:21 - or you know whatever you want and if you
51:23 - use it in a project I'd love to see your
51:25 - project so if it's if it's available on
51:28 - github or somewhere let me know like
51:30 - send me either let me know in the live
51:32 - chat or if you don't want everybody to
51:34 - see it you can just send me a direct
51:35 - message on Twitter or something like
51:36 - that but I really do I'd like to see if
51:39 - if you are using some of the stuff from
51:42 - the live streams in your own projects
51:44 - that I think it's really cool to see
51:46 - what you all do you know kind of based
51:50 - on what we've done here and how you
51:51 - improve it and do different things with
51:53 - it that I usually never even thought of
51:55 - doing okay I'm actually I'm gonna go
52:01 - back here now and just explain a little
52:03 - bit this so this kind of no beer I'm
52:09 - assuming that you're talking about just
52:11 - this kind of effect here that when we
52:13 - click it you know we get that that line
52:16 - underneath so this is
52:21 - just it's a material design kind of
52:24 - thing that you'll see commonly so that's
52:25 - why you know you see it on you know
52:27 - Google things basically this is really
52:34 - easy to do and react because it's built
52:36 - into material UI so if you use the
52:38 - material UI components this is going to
52:41 - happen for you automatically it also
52:45 - happens with materialized CSS so if
52:49 - you're not working with react you can
52:51 - still get this effect if you use
52:53 - materialized as your your CSS framework
52:56 - but you can also do something similar
52:59 - with just regular CSS so really you you
53:06 - could do a CSS only version of this too
53:10 - if you wanted but you know all that's
53:12 - happening here is you're changing the
53:14 - position and the size of this of this
53:19 - text here and then you're adding in some
53:23 - color and a size to this border right so
53:28 - just knowing that alone won't give you
53:30 - the exact effect because if you can see
53:32 - it's actually more like a second border
53:37 - expanding here so if you wanted that
53:40 - effect of it expanding you'd have to do
53:42 - a little bit more and actually have an
53:44 - entirely different you know span or div
53:46 - there that was going to grow in size so
53:51 - but you could certainly do that and I
53:55 - think I may have implemented some form
54:00 - of this in CSS and a previous project I
54:02 - can't remember what project it was right
54:04 - now I think though I didn't have the
54:09 - complete effect I think what I did was I
54:11 - just changed you know this border here
54:13 - so it didn't kind of grow out but
54:16 - everything else works the same so anyway
54:21 - hopefully that was explained a little
54:23 - bit of what was going on there but yeah
54:25 - you can easiest way to do it is use the
54:27 - framework either material UI if you're
54:29 - using react or materialized CSS if you
54:32 - use
54:32 - thing else or you can do it on your own
54:35 - just probably the easiest way is just
54:40 - check out how it's done on a Google site
54:42 - just to get your values for your CSS so
54:46 - you know font size and the amount that
54:51 - this moves you know things like that the
54:54 - the width of the bottom border here and
54:58 - the change in width so get those values
55:00 - from some site that's using something
55:03 - like this
55:04 - and then you can work it in you know
55:06 - whatever way you like to do it into your
55:08 - CSS or even use some JavaScript to help
55:10 - you with the effects you know depending
55:13 - on what you're comfortable with and it's
55:16 - not really it's not super hard to do I
55:19 - when I had done this just in some CSS I
55:23 - remember being somewhat surprised that
55:26 - how how easy it was to get you know
55:29 - something really similar to this going
55:31 - okay so let me start my time up again I
55:35 - wanted to get through everything in the
55:36 - live chat but I'm I'm not I'll have to
55:39 - wait till the next break to get get
55:42 - through more of it so I will come back
55:44 - to that same spot in the live chat so
55:52 - right around for me for my timestamp
55:55 - it's 234 p.m. so it's Eastern time okay
56:04 - let's start this up again and let's try
56:08 - to apply what we've done here
56:09 - so basically all we changed for this
56:12 - element is we've set the position to
56:15 - absolute and we've put the bottom value
56:19 - as negative 8 pixels so now let's figure
56:22 - out how to target this it doesn't look
56:25 - like there's hmm so there's no class no
56:31 - ID we can target
56:49 - let's see
57:05 - let me check so we are using form Z
57:08 - react and in particular we are using the
57:13 - material the material UI version of this
57:22 - which I think there's a link to form Z
57:27 - material UI so if there's a way to
57:30 - target that div specifically I'd like to
57:33 - do that otherwise I think we can do it
57:35 - with I think we can do it another way
57:41 - let's see that I pass
58:10 - who
58:14 - and I don't see not really much for
58:21 - documentation for this
58:50 - all right well let's
59:18 - alright let's just try to target this
59:20 - then with some CSS so if we go let's
59:26 - look at what's going on here I think I
59:30 - have this open already that's a test
59:34 - service request test maybe I don't have
59:41 - it open anyone there we go alright so
59:49 - let's check this out
59:57 - these are calm classes
60:06 - let's see if we can add a class name
60:38 - okay cool so we have our class now on
60:41 - this container div and we know
60:56 - the last
61:09 - then we have all righty Serena's house
61:14 - okay let's try this where's our styles
61:22 - are
61:29 - I'm just gonna put it in the home styles
61:30 - because we are using forms on more than
61:33 - one page so let's do this that's what we
61:43 - named it right rooms the input and let's
61:49 - see I think if I do div can I do last
62:00 - that's the will that work
62:05 - let's try I always mess up when I try to
62:10 - do these kind of pseudo selector things
62:13 - but it's worth a shot
62:17 - we're gonna have to use important to
62:23 - override those inline Styles normally
62:27 - would not be using important but not
62:31 - really not really a decent option to do
62:37 - it other than that and would be a bottom
62:43 - negative eight pixels alright so let's
62:47 - see if this works
62:48 - oh ho nice okay so we got some stuff
62:53 - going on here
62:54 - oh do we not put important that's
62:58 - important
63:04 - important so this should work now yeah
63:07 - it works all right let's make sure it
63:10 - actually applied to some other things
63:11 - awesome great
63:15 - let's see project description I think
63:19 - this needs to be
63:28 - to be not having I guess we didn't have
63:30 - any type of validation on these other
63:33 - ones actually this one is numeric right
63:36 - now there we go okay
63:46 - interesting
63:50 - this is this shouldn't have done
63:54 - anything
64:01 - Yeah right I should have done anything
64:04 - okay let's add in that I was just I was
64:10 - just checking it out because it should
64:12 - not have it shouldn't have done anything
64:15 - with the styles but this seemed like
64:17 - this was a lot tighter up to the bottom
64:20 - of here than it normally would have been
64:22 - so for a second I thought that some of
64:26 - our Styles did somehow get applied but
64:28 - we didn't put the class on any of the
64:30 - multiline inputs yet so let's add this
64:35 - class name in to our multi line fields
64:39 - as well and like yes I guess we can add
64:51 - it in here let's see
64:59 - this added in here as well and we don't
65:07 - have to worry about the checkboxes and
65:14 - now let's awesome great ok so we have
65:25 - you know we have these working great
65:29 - great alright so
65:44 - let's see
65:48 - I guess the next thing we're going these
65:51 - checkboxes then I know what you think I
65:56 - mean check the live chat really quickly
65:58 - just to see if anyone has has anything
66:02 - to say like maybe I did something really
66:04 - silly and I didn't realize it
66:19 - okay so it looks like CF code or 2 s is
66:25 - the input dropping location below the
66:27 - label from the form input as you type
66:30 - into the input something you styled or
66:33 - did that come with form Z
66:47 - that is formzee so well yes I mean this
66:57 - this effect here is not actually just
67:00 - forms this is material UI but you know
67:03 - this here is its with form Z I'm pretty
67:10 - sure it is I could double check maybe
67:12 - this does come with material UI in forms
67:14 - he just gives you some extra ways to
67:16 - format this and validate I'm not 100%
67:19 - sure on that but so you might want to
67:23 - check out the material UI documentation
67:25 - on text inputs to see if they have this
67:29 - validation field built-in but this for
67:35 - sure is built in a material UI Rohan
67:45 - good good look so Roman says it is it
67:48 - just me or the underlines gone you're
67:50 - right the underlines are gone what the
67:52 - heck
67:58 - all right so something happened and we
68:01 - don't have underlines let's see what
68:05 - happened
68:17 - water bottle
68:29 - all right let me take let's take this
68:32 - class name off of something here see if
68:37 - that brings him back
68:47 - okay yeah so definitely something we did
68:50 - took this took those boarders off the
68:53 - bottom so let's see what we did
69:03 - it says no that's not what has the
69:06 - border
69:23 - with
69:25 - part of this has the border
69:38 - this is it okay so this is where the
69:41 - borders coming from so let's see what
69:43 - it's the one on these
70:00 - that's what okay I thought about this
70:05 - and I didn't realize I didn't realize
70:09 - that these that this div contained the
70:12 - borders so they're actually a chars
70:15 - right with with borders okay
70:33 - so what we want to do then is
70:50 - let's put it back in here just take this
70:54 - out
70:58 - we should still have borders see
71:17 - I see now
71:38 - okay all right I see now so this won't
71:42 - work
72:02 - yeah if this won't work so what's
72:06 - happening is the div that I was trying
72:09 - to target as the last if they're only
72:13 - appears if there's an error and then
72:16 - it's not even in the Dom if there's not
72:18 - an error so then it switches and this
72:21 - becomes the last day of where the border
72:23 - is so we need to figure out some other
72:26 - way to target this div
72:36 - all right let me see I I haven't I this
72:39 - is gonna be the not a great way to do
72:44 - this but I think it's gonna be how we
72:49 - have to do it so we have to so let's
72:56 - just do EQ 2 for our target here so
73:01 - let's give how's this work I can't
73:09 - remember how you do this and CSS I'll
73:11 - have to look it up oh no is it not CSS
73:18 - there's it
73:26 - I'll EQ is the jQuery way to do it all
73:33 - right we could do
74:06 - let's let's do what was that - I'm
74:11 - Shawna remember if it's zero indexed or
74:13 - not I don't think it is okay all right
74:23 - let's try it try this
74:39 - let's put this in this world
74:52 - how can we do
75:05 - somehow this is
75:15 - Oh ro alright I just looked over the
75:18 - live chat and see you've seen what you
75:22 - type in there everyone it's not gonna
75:35 - work let's see if this works for this
75:41 - okay so it's working for these it's not
75:47 - but for the multi-line inputs it's not
75:49 - working so let's we're gonna have to do
75:58 - something different for the multi-line
75:59 - so I'm guessing that this has
76:21 - okay so this the second div for these
76:26 - inputs has the border
76:43 - I mean it's gonna be a little bit more
76:46 - complicated and I want it to be but I
76:47 - think
76:57 - and we should only need to customize it
76:59 - one more time
77:02 - Farzin multi-line
77:20 - alright let's see see what that does
77:52 - okay that works Wow all right
78:06 - okay
78:15 - all right so that looks like it is
78:17 - working now we have our underlines okay
78:29 - all right so this is what we ended up
78:32 - needing we needed two different classes
78:37 - so that's okay
78:40 - it looks like oops we need to change
78:47 - this is a multi line for our upload the
78:56 - the input that we're putting our file
78:58 - names into is multi-line as well so
79:01 - let's switch that okay great I want to
79:10 - check how much time I have left and this
79:12 - old man
79:13 - two minutes okay I do want to at least
79:19 - check to see what's going on with this
79:24 - why we're getting such a large amount of
79:31 - space between here
79:34 - interesting okay
79:47 - we change this
80:15 - all right so for this I'm wondering if
80:17 - we couldn't do the similar thing
80:18 - changing it to absolute position mmm the
80:22 - only thing I'm I guess I could just
80:30 - position out there yeah I think we could
80:32 - probably do the same thing with absolute
80:34 - position and then avoid having that gap
80:37 - so let's go with
81:17 - oh no it's up wait all right we would
81:20 - need to switch
81:28 - there we go
81:48 - okay so this is going to be probably not
81:51 - going to finish this in the stream but
81:53 - this is I think going to be the solution
81:55 - that will work so we've changed the
81:57 - positioning of the image itself to use
82:00 - absolute instead of relative position
82:02 - and then we just need to adjust the top
82:03 - and the right attributes here to get it
82:07 - positioned over to where it was before
82:09 - but the key is you notice when we first
82:13 - did this and we made a position absolute
82:15 - when we took off that top value it went
82:18 - way up here right so what we had to do
82:22 - is make give the containing give the
82:24 - position of relative then it would be
82:28 - absolute based on that container div so
82:31 - that's kind of CSS has I don't know it
82:34 - seems like some weird things when it
82:36 - comes to positioning and that and
82:39 - correct me if I'm wrong but from what I
82:42 - remember from the last time I dealt with
82:44 - this the absolute you put position
82:49 - absolute on something it's absolute as
82:51 - related to the nearest parent div that
82:56 - it has a position of relative if there's
82:59 - no parent divs that have a position
83:01 - relative then it's just based on
83:03 - basically the entire window right so
83:08 - that's why I shot right up here and
83:10 - that's why it went back down whenever I
83:11 - took this div and I put position
83:12 - relative on it right so if you have
83:17 - something happen like that if you if you
83:18 - can without messing things up at a
83:20 - position relative to the container div
83:22 - then that should make it a lot easier to
83:24 - position things like that so I think
83:27 - this should be this should solve it I
83:29 - definitely want to test it out to make
83:32 - sure but I haven't even tossed any other
83:35 - problems but that should be it and then
83:38 - you know we'll have a much much nicer
83:41 - spacing between that
83:44 - okay so been streaming for I did two I
83:49 - only did two Pomodoro sessions but I
83:53 - think I went over on both of them and I
83:55 - went over talking so on my break so
83:59 - we're actually almost an
84:02 - and a half into the stream at this point
84:04 - so I'm going to go to the live chat now
84:09 - and answer some questions so if you
84:12 - can't stick around for the question and
84:13 - answer session totally understand that
84:15 - the coding portion of this is done so
84:18 - thank you so much for watching if you
84:22 - can't stick around and you have
84:24 - questions please put them in the live
84:26 - chat right now even if you don't have a
84:28 - question it will be nice if you could
84:30 - help answer some of the questions in the
84:32 - live chat I'm certainly not an expert at
84:37 - at everything I may not be an expert at
84:40 - anything but so it definitely helps if
84:43 - more people were in the live chat and
84:45 - helping to contribute to give you know
84:47 - some really good answers to anyone
84:51 - that's in here so don't worry if you're
84:52 - a beginner you know any questions are
84:54 - fine don't don't be afraid nobody's
84:58 - going to laugh at you or say anything
85:01 - mean to you for if you ask a question
85:05 - that they think is basic or something
85:07 - like that I guess if someone is mean to
85:11 - somebody about the questions they ask in
85:13 - here then I'm not gonna be happy about
85:16 - it so let me scroll up to where I was
85:22 - and keep going from from that point
85:34 - okay so Rohan says the last two
85:38 - paragraphs in the submit suggested story
85:42 - forum should actually be shown after
85:45 - someone submits the story so let me
85:47 - check that out again look into each tip
85:55 - in determine my my fila website yeah I
86:01 - guess it would make sense I'm just
86:02 - wondering like would that flow be weird
86:05 - if there's a forum just right in the
86:07 - middle of these paragraphs I guess I
86:09 - could just I just do it and see what it
86:11 - looks like but that I mean I would move
86:16 - the forum up a little bit more well
86:22 - maybe I'll have to check that out at
86:23 - some point and just and see how it looks
86:25 - if it doesn't if it doesn't look weird
86:27 - to have that form right there then I'm
86:30 - okay with that
86:33 - actually I mean if on a different site
86:37 - what I would probably end up doing is is
86:39 - having this in some sort of banner so
86:41 - like a full width like color section
86:44 - here and then put that in the middle and
86:47 - then it would kind of stand out I think
86:49 - and not look but with the way this site
86:53 - is I'm not I'm not sure that it would
86:55 - look right we're not doing anything else
86:58 - like that on the whole site yeah I'll
87:06 - have to think about that anyway thanks
87:11 - for the suggestion I actually haven't I
87:14 - don't even remember the last time I read
87:15 - what what this text actually said it's
87:19 - probably been like a year and a half
87:21 - since I've read this stuff so you
87:25 - probably helped to read it and see if it
87:29 - even makes sense where I'm putting it
87:40 - okay Alexander says Jessie you can
87:42 - resize your page to a certain device in
87:44 - dev tools it's the second top left icon
87:47 - yeah definitely thanks for bringing that
87:49 - up so I I do use that sometimes so talk
87:54 - about this this dev tools icon here
87:57 - which brings this up so you can do like
88:02 - right now it's iPhone 4 I had to use
88:04 - this before I found what I use so this
88:08 - is good I use this but what I started to
88:09 - use that I think I like even better I
88:14 - mean that this is useful and really
88:15 - quick to do but if I have time to do
88:17 - more I like to for since I'm on a Mac
88:21 - for iPhone devices and iPads I actually
88:25 - use the simulator in Ex tools and that
88:29 - gives me a more accurate representation
88:33 - of what it would be like on a real
88:35 - iPhone and then well obviously I have an
88:38 - Android phone so I test on the Android I
88:40 - have a pixel so I can test on there but
88:45 - then also we have a browser stack
88:47 - account that I can go on browser stack
88:50 - and test on on different devices as well
88:53 - so I know browser stack is you know cost
88:56 - money but if you if you can get your
89:00 - employer to pay for it it's really
89:02 - useful or you know if you have if you
89:05 - have your own freelance business or
89:06 - agency or something like I would I I've
89:09 - found it to be very useful and
89:11 - definitely way less expensive than
89:12 - buying all those devices for testing
89:14 - yourself but thank you thanks Alexander
89:17 - that's definitely like such a useful
89:20 - feature in dev tools and Alexander also
89:24 - is a question it says is it better to
89:27 - use inline styles on a component or to
89:29 - write CSS in a different file using
89:31 - classes and all that goodies of
89:33 - pre-processors yeah so I don't I don't
89:42 - necessarily have a rule that I stick to
89:43 - all the time but it would depend on what
89:47 - I want to do in the situation right so
89:49 - if it's just kind of what I was saying
89:52 - before like
89:53 - if I need to make a change on something
89:55 - that I don't think I'll use often or you
89:59 - know anywhere else within the site I
90:02 - just use inline Styles it's fast it's
90:07 - easy for someone to come in and look at
90:08 - that component and know exactly what
90:10 - it's gonna look like because they can
90:12 - see the style right there if I have to
90:14 - put a lot of styles I'd rather do it in
90:17 - a separate sheet right because I don't
90:19 - want all those inline Styles cluttering
90:21 - up that component if I have a style that
90:25 - I want to be repeated in lots of places
90:28 - throughout the site I put it in a
90:30 - separate CSS or sass file if there's
90:33 - something that I'm doing that I want to
90:35 - do that would be beneficial to use the
90:38 - you know preprocessor for like sass like
90:42 - mix-ins or variables or something like
90:44 - that then I'll do it in the sass file if
90:47 - I need to use a hover effect or a media
90:50 - query
90:50 - I'm obviously can't do that inline so
90:54 - I'm going to do that in a CSS file so it
90:56 - kind of you know the answer is it
90:58 - basically coming just depends on your
91:00 - situation but for sure like it's just
91:04 - really fast especially if I'm testing
91:06 - things out I'm like I'm not sure if I
91:07 - really want to keep it like that I'm
91:09 - just testing styles it's usually faster
91:12 - just to do something inline really quick
91:13 - especially if you don't already have a
91:15 - CSS file
91:16 - you know linked up to that component you
91:20 - know a lot of times I just put it in
91:21 - there a third option is to do something
91:23 - like CSS and j/s or there's a there's a
91:27 - lot of different ways right now to put
91:29 - CSS in the component and it's not inline
91:32 - but you can put it either like in the
91:38 - top like as a constant or something and
91:41 - then you bring it in
91:42 - to the component or you can it just
91:47 - depends on what you're using so there
91:50 - there are other ways than just the kind
91:52 - of the two either in line or in a
91:54 - separate file there's kind of a hybrid
91:55 - method of having styles that you can
91:59 - write out like normal styles you do in
92:01 - CSS but they're actually included within
92:03 - your component so in my last project
92:07 - I got into some of that and then in
92:11 - future projects I'll probably try some
92:13 - different methods out as well because
92:14 - I'm really interested in trying the
92:15 - different ones out and seeing what's the
92:17 - best one so my knowledge at least from
92:19 - what I've read in videos I've watched
92:21 - there's not really like one standard
92:23 - that's emerged is the best way to do it
92:26 - there's still a lot of different things
92:28 - being used so which is kind of cool I'm
92:31 - sure at some point once things you know
92:33 - kind of mature with react there'll be
92:35 - something that is kind of accepted that
92:38 - most people use but for now I think it's
92:41 - it's kind of wide open as to what you
92:43 - know to use what's best for your use
92:46 - case for your situation and and just
92:49 - your preferences anyway that was kind of
92:52 - a long answer but hopefully it was
92:53 - helpful
93:08 - okay CF kotor - actually asks a similar
93:11 - thing I noticed CF kotor 2 says I
93:14 - noticed you use a lot of inline styling
93:15 - is there a reason for not using more
93:17 - class definitions to reuse styling so I
93:20 - basically my answer the last question
93:22 - probably answered that because that's
93:24 - that's kind of my my philosophy on
93:26 - inline vs styling versus using classes
93:30 - and things like that so hopefully I
93:32 - answered that if not if I didn't answer
93:34 - that you can you know ask ask me to
93:36 - follow up on that and be more specific I
93:40 - guess
93:58 - okay so no beer actually had a response
94:03 - to Alexander's question about the inline
94:05 - styles versus you know putting in style
94:09 - sheets so no bears opinion is that
94:11 - styling you know directly in the
94:14 - component is is better than having it in
94:21 - line because then your component or your
94:23 - HTML depending on what you're using
94:24 - isn't is more clean right so yeah and
94:29 - I'm definitely so I would agree with
94:32 - that right so I think as I said before
94:35 - I'm not opposed to using inline styles
94:37 - in certain situations as long as it's a
94:39 - you know just one style or maybe two
94:42 - styles right but I don't want to get it
94:44 - cluttered you know I want everything to
94:46 - seem clean within the component as well
94:48 - so I'm not entirely against it but
94:51 - definitely I definitely agree with that
95:08 - okay CF kotor - says your site looks
95:11 - great thank you I appreciate that but
95:13 - also some suggestion you can enhance
95:15 - your site even more by adding a
95:17 - background image semi-transparent or
95:19 - left edge more bold image that shrinks
95:22 - and with as device shrinks yeah I'll
95:26 - think about that
95:28 - I actually I was thinking about that a
95:30 - bit when we were looking at the the
95:32 - homepage so yesterday we had did some
95:36 - stuff to the homepage but I mean right
95:38 - now especially I mean this probably
95:40 - isn't a common trying to find a more
95:44 - common screen with but it's not as bad
95:47 - kind of with a more common with but if
95:49 - you get a large screen there there's
95:51 - just so much space so I kind of thought
95:53 - about doing some sort of background
95:55 - image or something but I'm not 100% sure
95:59 - about it yeah I'm not I'm not sure about
96:04 - it I'm kind of still thinking about it I
96:07 - almost I didn't want to go with that
96:10 - because so I'm recreating in react
96:15 - something that already exists as kind of
96:17 - a jQuery single page application and so
96:22 - I'm trying to mimic the how that looks
96:25 - so that the transition will be as easy
96:27 - as possible for the users so I didn't
96:31 - really want to add too much but I'm
96:34 - definitely going to think about that
96:36 - because I this does just look a little
96:40 - bit you know - I think yeah we think we
96:42 - talked about this yesterday is it just
96:44 - looks stark yes I'll think about that
96:48 - thank you for the suggestion
97:05 - okay at some point Alexander capita said
97:09 - use an ID and then put some question
97:11 - marks oh sorry I didn't get to that
97:12 - earlier I'm not sure was that when we
97:17 - were I think that was when I was trying
97:19 - to to get the get the div like for the
97:28 - service request form for that error
97:33 - message so I mean I wanted to use a
97:36 - class instead of an ID because it was
97:39 - going to be applied to multiple elements
97:40 - right because we were iterating over the
97:42 - data and putting in multiple elements so
97:48 - unless I'm unless I'm mistaken about
97:51 - what the what you were talking about
97:53 - with the ID I think a class would have
97:55 - been more appropriate there but maybe
97:58 - I'm misunderstanding
98:24 - okay cool so CF code or to actually put
98:27 - a a link to a site - that's kind of an
98:34 - example of the image so let's see I'm
98:37 - checking out on my other screen here
98:46 - okay cool I'll bring this over on my
98:48 - screen to C so C F code or two was
98:50 - saying like to put kind of an image like
98:54 - in the background so yes I could see
98:57 - that yeah yeah I think about the one
99:05 - that we use a lot of things like this
99:07 - for our external sites that are more
99:10 - like marketing site usually focus that
99:13 - trying to get students interested in the
99:15 - university I haven't really done a lot
99:19 - with this kind of thing for internal
99:21 - sites because I kind of I just keep them
99:23 - like really like more more focused on
99:27 - you know here's what you need to do so
99:31 - they're not nearly as kind of flashy but
99:34 - okay yeah I'll think about it thanks for
99:37 - the for the example
99:43 - all right click on the shows page to see
99:47 - if cute coder says click on the shows
99:50 - page
100:01 - okay
100:14 - so are you thinking then maybe each
100:17 - section would have you know different
100:19 - things like this different color yeah I
100:26 - really like this I mean I agree normally
100:29 - so here's what I'm kind of what I'm kind
100:33 - of torn between right so like normally I
100:35 - would be more flashy with with my site
100:38 - if he like said if this was an external
100:40 - site if the audience was external but
100:44 - whenever we bring this up so like
100:53 - initially when I was designing this I
100:55 - was having a lot of meetings with people
100:56 - in my department one of the things that
100:58 - they really liked and wanted was the
101:00 - fact that immediately users see all the
101:03 - options and only the options and there's
101:07 - not a lot of scrolling involved
101:10 - basically the idea was this needs to be
101:15 - very user friendly and appeal to a lot
101:19 - of people the university that are older
101:21 - and really don't they don't use
101:27 - computers that much and there's actually
101:30 - a certain percentage of people the
101:33 - university that are very against using
101:35 - computers for a lot of things so the
101:38 - idea was basically like don't clutter
101:42 - don't do anything like just give them
101:45 - and initially we only actually had six
101:47 - options here so we didn't even have as I
101:50 - added these three for this one but the
101:51 - current version of it only has six so
101:55 - it's really like immediately here are
101:57 - the things you can do and that's it so
102:03 - I'm a little bit hesitant to the kind of
102:05 - change that
102:10 - so I agree that it would look nicer if
102:13 - we did something else more flashy but
102:17 - I'm kind of like it's almost like think
102:21 - of this as very like a utilitarian like
102:24 - a dashboard right if you go to like
102:26 - Google Analytics dashboard or something
102:28 - they don't have a lot of images and
102:30 - flashy things like they would have maybe
102:33 - if you go to like the Google store right
102:35 - where they're trying to sell you
102:36 - something Google Analytics like you're
102:39 - going there because you want this data
102:40 - and you want to see your options right
102:44 - so this is kind of what what we're going
102:47 - for here is like there's certain
102:48 - information that people need to go here
102:52 - we don't need to sell them on anything
102:54 - this is more of just a resource so
102:58 - anyway that's just kind of like a
103:00 - background as to what we're going for
103:02 - here and maybe kind of the reasoning for
103:03 - doing this so I am still gonna think
103:07 - about this and how I can incorporate it
103:09 - but I'm I mean at least like you could
103:12 - see kind of my reasoning as to why I'm
103:14 - more hesitant to do it like that
103:25 - the other reason to that I'm a little
103:28 - bit hesitant about images is once you
103:31 - get into that then you have to I have to
103:35 - actually think about what images I want
103:36 - in there and select the images and
103:39 - handle you know handle everything that
103:42 - goes in with images because if I did
103:43 - that I'd certainly want to have multiple
103:45 - image sizes to do you know responsive
103:48 - images and things like that so it does
103:51 - add a little bit more complexity to a
103:55 - project that you know really should be
103:57 - wrapping up and should go live probably
104:02 - next week it's not entirely up to me I
104:05 - need to get feedback from other people
104:06 - but assuming that I would get prompt
104:09 - feedback you know this needs this should
104:11 - go live soon anyway I think it's a good
104:15 - debate I kind of would want to hear what
104:18 - everyone else thinks about that yeah
104:24 - because like I said I haven't really I
104:30 - haven't really tried anything like that
104:32 - for this but yeah I don't know let me
104:37 - know what you all think I can't
104:39 - guarantee that I'll be able to go with
104:41 - you know your suggestions in that area
104:43 - even if I agree with it you know I still
104:46 - kind of have to since that would be a
104:48 - significant change to the look of this I
104:50 - still you know it would have to be
104:53 - approved by people higher up in my
104:55 - department as well but I guess I'm open
104:59 - I'm open to the idea
105:11 - okay Rohan says positioning and CSS is a
105:17 - nightmare
105:17 - yeah sure it's uh yeah sometimes it can
105:24 - definitely be it can be tricky
105:35 - let's see oh cool Alexander says thank
105:39 - you Jesse you're the man you're welcome
105:45 - CF kotor 2 says Jesse what's your
105:47 - contact info I'd like to chat offline
105:49 - later yeah my I have some of my info in
105:54 - the description so like Instagram
105:57 - Twitter if you go to my youtube channel
106:02 - which I think I have links as well in
106:05 - the description if not it's just I think
106:12 - I for sure I have a link in my Twitter a
106:14 - description I also have linked up some
106:16 - of my other social media so if you want
106:18 - to get a hold of me through through
106:20 - whatever social media channel you like
106:22 - best that's cool just you know send me a
106:25 - message
106:32 - Oh John Henson says if you use a
106:34 - background image you would need to
106:36 - prefetch and store it in cash
106:38 - not sure how create react app uses
106:40 - serviceworkers to make that efficient
106:43 - yeah actually I'm not sure either I
106:45 - haven't done a lot with with images and
106:47 - create react app I say did do the first
106:51 - project I did for the nanodegree had
106:53 - images as well maybe I'll have to take a
106:58 - look at that and see how how about was
107:00 - done but that's a good point I hadn't
107:04 - really thought of that
107:20 - uh-huh okay John Hanson says in regard
107:25 - to the images I guess says I get older
107:28 - we usually need simple straightforward
107:32 - mike says I bet I am the best coder in
107:36 - here that's entirely possible Mike I've
107:39 - never really seen your coat or your work
107:40 - but you know that's it's definitely
107:45 - fault I don't think it would take that
107:46 - much to be a better coder than I am so
107:48 - I'm not gonna argue with you there but
107:51 - we do have some really knowledgeable
107:53 - people in here in the chat so definitely
107:57 - have some competition for best coder
108:06 - oh cool all right so CF coder to found
108:10 - the my Twitter and sent me some some
108:14 - tweets they're so awesome well take a
108:16 - look at those and get back to you soon
108:17 - as I can
108:27 - mike is saying I might give even give
108:32 - you some lessons sometimes you just have
108:35 - to go if your passion yeah Mike
108:36 - certainly if you ever have any advice
108:38 - and you want to put it in the live chat
108:40 - it's definitely appreciated okay
108:47 - Rolo I mentioned earlier that CSS
108:50 - positioning can be tricky sometimes and
108:53 - John Hanson says positioning is a charm
108:56 - with CSS grid all browsers will be on
108:59 - board except internet explorer by
109:01 - January 2018
109:03 - that's awesome off to check into that I
109:05 - haven't really done much at all with CSS
109:07 - grid so if it's going to be supported
109:10 - with browsers then that's that's great
109:15 - all right cool Steve asks how much would
109:18 - it cost to have this site developed hmm
109:22 - I don't know I haven't really thought
109:28 - about how much I would charge for for
109:33 - this site I guess I could give you like
109:36 - a ballpark figure I suppose
109:50 - I don't know maybe like if I were going
109:56 - to do something like this for a client
109:59 - also like including like server setup
110:04 - and everything like that
110:05 - SSL like I don't know maybe probably the
110:22 - lowest I would go is I don't know it's
110:28 - tough to say on the spot but maybe like
110:30 - I don't know somewhere between 5,000 and
110:34 - 15,000 I know that's a big range but I
110:37 - have to really think about it more it's
110:42 - hard to say though because this is not
110:44 - really a normal site like so many
110:46 - decisions were already made ahead of
110:48 - time the content was already there so
110:52 - things were already set up like some of
110:56 - the accounts were set up like the
110:57 - SendGrid api stuff so I don't know so I
111:01 - guess this project seems somewhat easier
111:05 - than it would have been if I was
111:06 - starting from scratch and had to make a
111:10 - lot of these decisions that were already
111:11 - made so that's why I have such a big
111:13 - range cuz I'm not I'm not exactly sure
111:15 - what this would be like let's see
111:25 - so anyway I don't know I'd be good to
111:27 - see what you all think that you would
111:30 - charge for something like this or that
111:31 - you would pay for something like this
111:34 - it's always interesting to see like
111:36 - pricing opinions on pricing and also I'm
111:43 - not sure what it's like for different
111:44 - areas of the world so like right now I'm
111:46 - in the United States so in other
111:50 - countries or even other areas in the
111:52 - United States I guess pricing could
111:55 - could be a lot you know different
112:14 - chuna instances don't don't web
112:17 - developers make around $5 an hour when
112:19 - they charge $30 an hour are you are you
112:23 - saying that because projects in the
112:28 - community John I'm so what's what's up
112:35 - with that they comment are you saying
112:37 - that because projects end up always
112:39 - taking longer or what if it's hourly I
112:44 - guess it shouldn't matter right
112:54 - okay all right I've gotten to the bottom
113:03 - of the live chat so wow we've been going
113:08 - for almost two hours now so it's
113:10 - definitely definitely about that time to
113:14 - wrap things up I really appreciate
113:18 - everything oh we had a foreigner okay so
113:21 - DP solution says I think he didn't make
113:25 - preparation he is like a child speak for
113:28 - a while and then silent so I'm assuming
113:31 - this talking about me and you're you are
113:36 - right I I make no preparations for these
113:38 - videos so yeah and in terms of the
113:42 - speaking and in being silent like yeah
113:45 - that most of the time that's because I'm
113:48 - trying to read something what's going on
113:50 - the live chat so anyway yeah that's
113:53 - entirely right yeah these these streams
113:57 - are not I don't prepare for these the
114:02 - the point of these streams are to show
114:05 - what it's like for me as a front-end
114:08 - developer to do my day-to-day work so I
114:10 - purposely want to keep in any mistakes I
114:13 - make I don't want it to be scripted or
114:16 - rehearsed because that wouldn't be an
114:18 - accurate representation of what I do so
114:21 - obviously I don't narrate what I'm doing
114:23 - doing my normal job but I I do want us
114:28 - to be somewhat helpful as well
114:30 - so that's why I try to narrate things
114:32 - but so that's why you know coming in if
114:36 - you know this is definitely not the
114:38 - place for a thorough tutorial and it's
114:41 - certainly not efficient
114:43 - you know since right we're doing this on
114:46 - the fly I make a lot of mistakes I stop
114:47 - for questions I do things so you know
114:49 - definitely a shorter more concise
114:52 - tutorial would be better if you don't
114:55 - have a lot of time but like I said this
114:57 - is not the point of this is not really
114:59 - like tutorial based it's more of I just
115:04 - had the idea that it might be good
115:05 - instead of saying pre rehearse
115:07 - videos which are awesome just to see
115:10 - somebody mess up sometimes and but still
115:15 - work through it and still produce you
115:17 - know produce something so yeah so anyway
115:23 - I try to I don't always remember to
115:26 - explain that when I do the streams but I
115:28 - try to do it you know when I remember
115:31 - because I imagine it could be somewhat
115:33 - confusing for new people watching to see
115:35 - like hey what the heck is this guy doing
115:37 - like he doesn't know what he's doing
115:39 - he's messing up so anyway that was I
115:42 - just kind of thought like I know when I
115:43 - started out at the beginning it was I
115:46 - loved watching the YouTube videos or
115:48 - these people that were amazing but it
115:49 - did somewhat make me feel like wow these
115:52 - people were like way better than me and
115:54 - they were better than me legitimately
115:56 - but it gives kind of a false impression
115:59 - that like I was making way more mistakes
116:03 - than I should when in reality I think at
116:06 - least for me I make mistakes right I I
116:12 - produce websites that work that fulfill
116:16 - you know the requirements of my clients
116:19 - of where I work so I am employed
116:24 - full-time as a front-end developer so I
116:26 - mean I'm I'm getting work done and I'm
116:29 - producing work that I'm proud of but I
116:32 - still make a lot of mistakes and I have
116:34 - to learn as I'm going so I just kind of
116:35 - wanted people to see like that and kind
116:38 - of see how I need to struggle through
116:39 - things and I was kind of hoping it would
116:41 - give new people some hope that like you
116:47 - know that everybody's just kind of
116:51 - struggling and learning as they go so
116:53 - anyway that was that was kind of purpose
116:56 - so hopefully that kind of explains why
116:59 - it does you know it does really seem
117:01 - like this is just kind of me winging it
117:04 - sometimes because that's that's the
117:07 - point
117:10 - [Music]
117:12 - so I didn't get a few more messages
117:14 - while I was while I was talking so let
117:17 - me just read through these
117:19 - make sure there's no questions that I
117:21 - need to answer before I end things
117:37 - okay bill well says thanks for all the
117:40 - effort Jessie oh you're welcome today I
117:43 - have one question should I just watch
117:45 - your videos or would it be useful if I
117:46 - code alongside you two I've never really
117:49 - thought about coding alongside I would
117:52 - say it definitely depends on what you
117:54 - want to get out of the videos and what
117:55 - type of learner you are some people do
117:58 - really well with just watching other
118:00 - people have the ability to do multiple
118:02 - things and still pick things up so if
118:05 - you know like that that hands-on type of
118:07 - thing is better for you then go ahead I
118:08 - know there are some people that do other
118:11 - work and just kind of listen to me in
118:13 - the background and then occasionally
118:14 - like they'll they'll come over and
118:16 - contribute in the live chat so I guess I
118:21 - don't really have that I don't really
118:22 - think there's like one way that's best
118:24 - to watch these these videos you know
118:26 - I've found you know people do it
118:29 - differently some people don't even watch
118:30 - the live streams often and they watch
118:32 - the recording on like two times speed
118:34 - and that's better for them so sorry I
118:38 - can't really give you a definite answer
118:40 - on that just some ideas for how other
118:42 - people have told me that they do it
118:58 - okay Rohan says I personally have the
119:01 - stream going on in the background while
119:03 - I browse through the interwebs projects
119:05 - here - targeted to practice alongside
119:07 - yeah for sure that's that's a good point
119:10 - yeah sometimes it might be difficult to
119:15 - go alongside to code alongside also
119:18 - because I work on this in between
119:20 - streams it might sometimes be hard to
119:22 - catch up I do try to keep the github
119:24 - repo as up-to-date as possible so
119:26 - potentially you could pull in all the
119:28 - changes at the beginning of each show
119:30 - and be right right there so it would be
119:35 - possible I think to code alongside but
119:38 - for me I would probably have trouble
119:41 - doing it personally
119:43 - but you know that that might just be my
119:46 - you know kind of my style of how I
119:49 - learned enable am able to do things but
119:51 - it might work well for you I don't know
120:07 - okay now I'm for real this time to the
120:11 - bottom of the live chat I've read
120:12 - through everything I think I think I've
120:15 - gotten to all the all the questions if I
120:18 - miss your question I'm sorry about that
120:19 - you can ask it again in another live
120:21 - chat or put in the comment to the videos

120:36 - filled up I have meetings in the morning
120:38 - I have a doctor's appointment in the
120:40 - afternoon it's going to be tough to find

120:47 - going to stream tomorrow I'll schedule
120:48 - the stream sometime tomorrow morning
120:50 - I'll post on Twitter when I'm gonna
