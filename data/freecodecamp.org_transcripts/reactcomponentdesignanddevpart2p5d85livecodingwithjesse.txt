00:08 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:10 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're going
00:13 - to finish that component that we started
00:14 - yesterday so if you didn't see yesterday
00:17 - stream don't worry we'll kind of go
00:21 - through what we'll go over a little bit
00:23 - about what we did yesterday but if you
00:26 - want to see it from the beginning you
00:28 - can always watch the recording later on
00:32 - but today we'll we'll finish building
00:37 - out that component a bit make it look
00:39 - nice and then we'll actually make it its
00:43 - own component right now it exists within
00:45 - a much larger component but we want to
00:48 - put it somewhere else and we'll also
00:50 - grab some some data and plug in some
00:54 - real data and see how that how that
00:58 - looks all right so let me get my my view
01:11 - situated here and I'm a paste in this
01:18 - link
01:24 - all right so just pasted a link in a
01:25 - live chat that link will take you to the
01:28 - website and so that you can look at what
01:33 - we're doing you know while you're while
01:36 - we're doing it so it's hosted on my
01:37 - computer and it's using a service called
01:40 - an grub so that you all can click on it
01:42 - as well Oh
01:47 - Aniki says in a live chat just saying hi
01:50 - gonna go watch the football match
01:51 - alright thanks for saying hi Stevens
01:57 - here sis what's up awesome Michaels here
01:59 - great I asked nice alright cool so it
02:04 - looks like yeah we're getting a few more
02:06 - viewers I didn't realize I'd be
02:08 - competing with with one of the football
02:10 - matches so who knows maybe I won't get
02:14 - that many viewers okay Phoenix says was
02:21 - watching the Elector skill dev
02:22 - livestream before oh cool how how was
02:26 - that livestream I didn't get to catch it
02:28 - live yesterday because I was streaming
02:30 - and then today I didn't get to catch it
02:32 - either is it is it finished drought I
02:36 - wanted to start when that finished so
02:38 - yesterday I didn't realize what was
02:40 - happening so we overlapped but I'm gonna
02:42 - try to avoid the overlap for the rest of
02:44 - the week for those of you who don't know
02:47 - what I'm talking about there's another
02:48 - livestream going on this week on the
02:51 - free code camp channel and that
02:53 - livestream is all about creating an
02:56 - Alexa skill so that's actually really
03:00 - cool I've done Alexa skill development
03:02 - before and it's super fun it's something
03:05 - I definitely wanted to want to do again
03:07 - and make new skills so I'm planning on
03:09 - watching that that series probably will
03:13 - get to it live but I'll watch the
03:14 - recordings alright so let me switch up
03:22 - my view there we are okay so the link to
03:29 - all this code is in the description to
03:33 - this video and it's on github so feel
03:37 - free to take a look if you do happen to
03:38 - go to get up and want to check it out
03:40 - check out in the pages folder the
03:44 - component called major J s that's where
03:47 - we'll be at and that code should all be
03:50 - up to date so it should look exactly
03:52 - like I have it on my screen and what
03:57 - we're what we've built so far basically
04:00 - is just this so pretty pretty simple
04:05 - we had some yet some issues yesterday
04:08 - where we're having some errors but
04:10 - finally got it to work and here's how it
04:12 - looks let's go over here and this is the
04:20 - wrong page let me go back and back and
04:25 - back here we go
04:31 - there we go okay so if you go to that
04:36 - link that Ida sent you and then put in
04:38 - slash education then you should see a
04:41 - page like this hopefully and this
04:44 - section down here is what we've created
04:46 - it's a tab section and we want to
04:51 - display classes so right now obviously
04:57 - it functions it doesn't have all the
04:59 - content needed and it doesn't really
05:01 - have very much styling at all so that's
05:04 - what we need to do we need to get it
05:06 - some data do some styling and it extract
05:11 - it into its own component so we don't
05:13 - clutter up that main component too much
05:20 - okay
05:24 - all right so I guess the first thing
05:31 - what should we do first let's let's
05:38 - Express command its own she put in its
05:43 - own spot yeah at this point I think
05:46 - we'll be safe to do that let's take this
05:51 - make it its own component and then we
05:58 - can start work on the styles this is
06:05 - just it's starting to get just a little
06:06 - bit bigger than I that I normally like
06:09 - so this is I think a nice size for a
06:13 - component if you have something really
06:14 - complex going on it's understandable
06:17 - that you'll get bigger than this but
06:18 - it's always easier to at least from my
06:21 - opinion it's easier to work with smaller
06:24 - file sizes and just switch back and
06:27 - forth between them
06:35 - okay all right so I'm gonna go in to my
06:40 - components folder I can find it let's
06:45 - shrink that up there we go
06:47 - all right here's our components folder
06:49 - and I'm gonna add a new file and let's
06:52 - call this sample schedule Dutch is yeah
07:06 - sample schedule j/s and I'm gonna throw
07:09 - this over on this side so we'll have
07:11 - them side by side and I'm I'm gonna
07:14 - start out by copy and pasting everything
07:16 - all right that might seem a little bit
07:18 - weird like we definitely don't need
07:19 - everything but I find it's easier to
07:23 - copy and paste everything and then
07:25 - remove what you don't need then to try
07:27 - to copy and paste piece by piece so what
07:30 - we'll do first is like we can get rid of
07:35 - a surprise yeah let's get rid of this
07:41 - first because we won't need that
07:44 - we'll keep state and with the syntax
07:48 - highlighting that we have sometimes
07:49 - it'll help us to figure out what we need
07:53 - and don't need all right so what can you
07:57 - take out here we can actually we can
08:01 - take out all this query stuff yeah all
08:09 - of that can go so you see it's gonna be
08:15 - way you know cleaner and we can get rid
08:20 - of this return and even that layout
08:22 - right cuz what we'll have is just this
08:25 - this div here that's wrapping everything
08:28 - and we'll keep these and we can get rid
08:35 - of this query
08:39 - and get rid of that and we definitely
08:45 - can get rid of this
08:52 - and in this layout and I believe we can
08:57 - get rid of this as well
09:00 - double check that yep so that that works
09:06 - and let's change the name of this to
09:10 - instead of major we're going to name we
09:13 - need to name this after the component so
09:15 - we'll call this sample schedule sample
09:23 - schedule we don't need a yes I don't
09:25 - know why it's like that
09:26 - alright so sample schedule
09:29 - I'm gonna save just so it'll give me the
09:31 - right indentation and get rid all that
09:33 - red there we go
09:36 - alright great and now like I said with
09:38 - that syntax highlighting it
09:40 - automatically shows us what what we're
09:42 - not using so now that I've taken out the
09:47 - stuff in the bottom it's easy to just
09:50 - remove these things we know now what we
09:54 - don't need right and there we go and I
10:02 - probably could do without all this they
10:07 - do with thongs hmm looks that's it say
10:15 - any expect consistent spacing spacing I
10:19 - don't know that we need this but I'm
10:22 - gonna leave it in there for now I don't
10:26 - think it'll hurt anything and we
10:32 - actually we don't need these styles
10:34 - right now like this root style but I'm
10:40 - just gonna leave it here because we're
10:41 - gonna be adding some styles in alright
10:45 - so now what we're left with is something
10:48 - that is a lot cleaner
10:51 - you know easier to deal with
10:54 - oops we can take this out too forgot to
10:58 - take that out
10:59 - and that since we've taken that out can
11:02 - we take this div no they will still need
11:06 - yeah we need that in closing dev there
11:09 - we go alright now we have nice and clean
11:13 - just what we need if we really wanted to
11:17 - we could probably extract out even more
11:19 - and we'll see what happens as we build
11:21 - this out if it starts to get big you
11:23 - know maybe we'll do it not 100%
11:27 - necessary I don't think at least not yet
11:29 - so now we have our component so for
11:34 - those of you who are new to react I'm
11:36 - gonna go really basic here for those of
11:38 - you who have used it before just you
11:40 - know bear with me and be patient but now
11:44 - that we have taken this out like how do
11:47 - we use it in this this other component
11:49 - which will be our parent component so
11:52 - the first thing that we can do and we
11:55 - will do is we're gonna remove a lot of
12:02 - this so we get rid of that and in its
12:12 - place we can just say sample schedule
12:18 - okay for now we're not gonna pass any
12:22 - props but eventually we will need to
12:25 - pass it some data and we have this
12:28 - little line depending on how you have
12:30 - you added or set up you may or may not
12:31 - get this line but for us we could get
12:34 - this line actually I think I'm gonna
12:38 - remove this link as well or that that
12:41 - little code I commented out so when I go
12:47 - here we can actually remove these
12:52 - because those are now in this component
12:55 - and we can remove these because they're
13:03 - no longer needed but here we're gonna
13:06 - import video we're gonna import that
13:11 - sample sample scheduled component from
13:20 - we're gonna go to components oops
13:28 - sample schedule so now we've imported
13:32 - that so all of that code is available to
13:34 - us and if we go back down that line is
13:39 - gone so now it will pull in all of this
13:42 - so let's save it and see if we've done
13:46 - it right if we've done it right we
13:47 - shouldn't get an error and we should see
13:49 - the same thing that we just saw at the
13:51 - beginning of the stream let's check it
13:54 - out and we get an error I'm gonna
13:58 - refresh just to be sure okay contra
14:01 - property value of no we got this we got
14:08 - this yesterday major ridges yes 24 maybe
14:11 - I left value in I think I did I need to
14:15 - remove it there we go there's one line I
14:18 - forgot to remove that we had moved over
14:20 - here and that line no longer made sense
14:24 - to be there so let's see if that fix the
14:27 - issue
14:29 - Apolo cannot be property apollo
14:33 - undefined and alright let's see maybe I
14:39 - do need to take out
14:46 - hmm
14:56 - I'm guessing it has something to do with
14:58 - what I put in it all right so what I'm
15:00 - gonna do is I'm gonna look at another
15:02 - component that we've made oops that's
15:06 - some data may be making another
15:08 - component I just looked over I'm gonna
15:15 - look over at the chat and see if anybody
15:17 - caught my mistake yet before I try to
15:19 - fix it here Michael asked if I started
15:24 - the timer I do it's about 12 minutes
15:26 - left
15:40 - okay all right so I do see your comments
15:45 - and I'll get to them as soon as the
15:46 - timer goes up I didn't see anything
15:49 - about what's going on here okay so let
16:00 - me check
16:02 - let's check this again see if I can see
16:08 - what's happening
16:36 - hmmm alright what was my oh I know what
16:40 - I was going to do to try to figure out
16:42 - what to do so I'm gonna look at my
16:45 - components and I'm just gonna pick you
16:47 - know any of them really it doesn't
16:48 - matter and we'll see what we're doing
16:50 - here so it looks like yeah we definitely
16:54 - don't need a Paulo do we even need we
16:59 - don't need with roots and so styles do
17:07 - we need with data no probably not
17:11 - then get rid of these and then down here
17:15 - we can get rid of this there we go
17:33 - all right that should should fix it so
17:36 - we were basically importing and trying
17:37 - to do some things here in this component
17:39 - that we didn't really need to great okay
17:43 - now it works we'll scroll down hey we
17:46 - have the component right so here we have
17:48 - your three or four awesome awesome cool
17:56 - so now it's in its own component the
18:00 - nice thing about this too is if we
18:02 - wanted to we could reuse this today
18:07 - which I'm not sure where we'll reuse it
18:10 - right now but it's a large project so we
18:16 - may find a use for this at some point
18:20 - and if that happens all we have to do is
18:23 - just import let's get rid of this just
18:27 - import sample schedule and then pop it
18:30 - in so I I definitely if you're doing
18:35 - react I definitely recommend breaking
18:37 - things out into their own components
18:38 - whenever that makes sense to do it so
18:42 - now that we have this kind of broken
18:44 - down here what we want to do is we want
18:50 - to do next I think it's actually put in
18:52 - some data I think it's better to have
18:54 - real data or the least realistic data
18:58 - that's going to accurately represent
18:59 - kind of the amount and size of the data
19:02 - that you'll have before I go into
19:04 - styling because some things might change
19:07 - if we get a lot of stuff in there
19:09 - positioning a thing it just we're not
19:12 - really sure how it's gonna look until we
19:14 - get the data in there so that's the next
19:15 - step for that I think the easiest thing
19:18 - would be to use the WordPress REST API
19:23 - to just pull in some JSON data and I'll
19:27 - copy and paste that you know right into
19:30 - our component and then use that data
19:32 - okay that's not how we'll actually do it
19:35 - when we make this live but it'll be a
19:38 - really quick way for us to get get
19:41 - something in there and not have to type
19:43 - it out ourselves
19:45 - let's go over here and just close some
19:49 - of these out so we can go W key we
20:02 - should be able to know what is that WP
20:05 - JSON I can't remember what the end point
20:11 - is alright let's look up the end point
20:13 - cuz I just totally can't you know what
20:16 - we have in our code already we'll grab
20:20 - it from our code why is there an for
20:28 - just our search page where we are using
20:30 - the REST API there we go there's our end
20:35 - point so let's grab that and if we put
20:38 - in our end point into a regular browser
20:40 - will be able to see data all right so
20:44 - here's a lot of data way more than we
20:46 - really need but let's see if we can get
20:55 - let's see if it'll be on here already
20:58 - [Music]
21:01 - sample course great see so it this the
21:06 - screen that it gives you but you know
21:08 - automatically shows you all your routes
21:10 - and everything so we're gonna go to
21:12 - sample courses and that I don't narrow
21:17 - it down for us for a sample course and
21:19 - this should give us all of the sample
21:23 - courses
21:28 - all right great so you see we have our
21:32 - data and this is the part of the data
21:34 - that I'm really worried about here so
21:38 - we'll probably grab a little bit more
21:41 - because I'll need the title but then
21:47 - everything else you need to stay in here
21:56 - let's see yeah let's just grab this one
22:02 - grab the whole the whole thing and then
22:07 - once we paste it will get rid of what we
22:08 - don't want
22:09 - so we've we should be able to just go in
22:16 - here we'll make we'll call this course
22:23 - data and then we're gonna make it to
22:30 - make it as close as possible what we're
22:31 - really going to see it's going to be an
22:35 - array of objects
22:45 - why is it expecting oh you know what I
22:54 - accidentally I didn't realize that I was
22:57 - already pasting in this bracket so let's
22:59 - try that again
23:00 - okay great so even though we're only
23:04 - gonna have one object here like we may
23:07 - end up having more than one object so
23:10 - this is what we're gonna deal with so
23:13 - I'm gonna remove a lot of this just to
23:22 - make it easier to it to work with
23:39 - there we go we want that ACF data there
23:47 - we go and there we go you can get rid of
23:56 - all of that what's this do we keep we
24:03 - have one too many brackets here too okay
24:11 - let's close maybe it's just complaining
24:20 - about that unexpected so again okay I
24:24 - think he was just complaining about the
24:25 - trailing commas hopefully that wasn't no
24:33 - still mm-hmm expected late they really
24:40 - expected the comma
24:56 - yeah I mean it looks okay in terms of
24:59 - how many brackets we have
25:23 - all right anybody see that what did I
25:27 - let me take my timer all right two
25:30 - minutes okay
25:32 - it's in about two minutes I'll go back
25:35 - and answer questions in the live chat
25:38 - for now let me make this a bit bigger
25:40 - here on the screen and try to figure out
25:44 - what my error is
25:58 - No so it's possible I messed something
26:03 - up when I was copy or when I was
26:07 - removing content ACF and within there's
26:11 - year this would be a bit better if the
26:17 - indentation was correct so let's see
26:25 - actually where is this okay year it is
26:33 - another array
27:18 - okay that works
27:35 - okay Julio says all shift f2 format
27:38 - thank you it's not working for me
27:49 - oh [ __ ] is it different for a Mac
28:25 - oh okay what do we have now that should
28:29 - match up spring semester there we go
28:39 - command shift P is for okay let's try
28:42 - that command shift P formats
29:03 - I what is this I never I do not know
29:08 - what these symbolize I can never
29:11 - remember what this okay Control Alt be
29:16 - great can't control I'll be I still not
29:26 - formatting it all right then oh well my
29:32 - times up let's do a short break I'll go
29:34 - back to the chat and answer some
29:35 - questions and then maybe I'll realize
29:38 - what I'm doing wrong here
29:51 - all right Albert Marsh says how long do
29:53 - you finish this project sorry if you
29:55 - answered this question before all you
29:57 - had no problem the project's not ever
30:01 - really going to be finished it's just
30:02 - gonna have a launch date and then after
30:04 - that we're gonna make updates to
30:06 - different sections so a lot of what we
30:11 - have on the site now is old fragments of
30:14 - HTML from from the old site it's not
30:19 - really ideal but we don't we don't have
30:24 - time to design and develop new suffer
30:28 - everything right so we want to launch
30:31 - first with the content as is and then
30:35 - develop but I'd like to launch by the
30:40 - end of this month or I don't know like
30:45 - early August so I'm gonna have I'm gonna
30:48 - serve you my wrist on the 20th of July I
30:52 - don't know what my recovery times gonna
30:54 - be like if I could have it launched
30:56 - before then that would be awesome but
30:58 - then if something goes wrong I don't
31:01 - really know how much I could do so I
31:03 - don't know if it makes more sense to
31:04 - launch before or after my surgery so I
31:11 - yeah so I don't really know but I would
31:13 - I would say it's it's going to be
31:15 - launched within the next month it's at
31:18 - some point and then after that we'll
31:20 - probably work on some other projects and
31:22 - this project and just kind of bounce
31:25 - around unless there's some other big
31:27 - thing that I'm gonna get assigned to
31:30 - work on which definitely could happen
31:44 - Phoenix says I'm competing with FIFA
31:47 - World Cup semi-final and the transfer
31:50 - news of Ronaldo from Real Madrid alright
31:54 - well I've no wonder I don't have as many
31:57 - viewers as I had yesterday right that's
31:59 - what I'm gonna blame on the lack of
32:01 - yours I'm gonna blame it on that and not
32:04 - at all on me hey in this year how's it
32:09 - going I feel like I haven't seen you for
32:12 - a long time maybe just because I had the
32:15 - vacation and everything and but I'm glad
32:18 - you're here how you doing oh let me
32:20 - answer your question I'm doing I'm doing
32:22 - it well I actually am feeling really
32:25 - well lately so but anyway how are you
32:28 - doing how you doing oh no Boone savage
32:35 - says hi started back on 100 days of code
32:39 - again last week awesome awesome
32:43 - good job with that keep us updated
32:58 - see
33:06 - Stephen says hi I'm new to frontin can I
33:09 - get started on react yeah it depends on
33:14 - how much JavaScript you know I feel a
33:18 - basic understanding of JavaScript you
33:19 - may be able to get started with some
33:22 - basic react and just kind of learn and
33:25 - build your skills up with JavaScript and
33:27 - react as you go you also want a basic
33:29 - understanding of HTML and CSS so the
33:35 - more you understand about JavaScript
33:37 - HTML and CSS before you get into react
33:39 - the easier it'll be to to learn it not
33:45 - impossible to learn without those things
33:47 - but it's you're just gonna have to learn
33:49 - them all at the same time
33:53 - Albert Maher says you should update
33:55 - visual studio code so you could get the
33:57 - outline feature I thought I was up to
34:02 - day off to check that will services this
34:10 - is in response to the question about
34:12 - getting started with react says if you
34:14 - are really new do the free code camp
34:15 - stuff then go do the 7 day free trial
34:19 - treehouse web design track ok cool
34:24 - yeah that's definitely good advice if
34:25 - you really are starting out yeah
34:27 - definitely check out free code camp I
34:28 - haven't checked out anything on
34:30 - treehouse so but I've heard good things
34:34 - about it so check that out as well
34:36 - treehouse is a paid program so you know
34:39 - you can do the free trial but free code
34:42 - camp if you didn't know from the name is
34:46 - entirely free all right I didn't get
34:53 - through everything but I'm gonna go
34:55 - ahead and put start this timer again
34:57 - I'll come back and any questions that I
34:58 - missed this time around I'll get you
35:00 - next time all right let's get back to
35:04 - this this code see what I'm doing wrong
35:08 - let's just try a deleting stuff and see
35:11 - what we can delete
35:28 - there we go this will simplify things so
35:31 - now we can see that we need a closing
35:36 - bracket
35:38 - oops no we need to close this and to
35:44 - close this right
35:58 - yeah
36:04 - okay not exactly correct do we need
36:17 - I think we need one more bracket here
36:20 - and that's gonna cover us here yep and
36:24 - so then the next thing that we'll need
36:26 - is actually a bracket a curly bracket
36:31 - then love a regular bracket right
36:46 - what happened all right and that's gonna
36:48 - be there
36:50 - can I read prep you know to undefined
36:52 - [Music]
37:06 - what are these areas for oh this is just
37:09 - indentation so I should be fine what was
37:14 - that thing was a ctrl alt ctrl shift B
37:19 - or something like that I'll control B I
37:21 - don't remember for whatever reason it's
37:24 - not Auto formatting for me but it looks
37:29 - like this will work since yes since
37:32 - that's all indentation I'm gonna leave
37:34 - it for now now we have course data so
37:40 - here's where we can do some fun stuff
37:43 - with the course data we can for now
37:53 - we're gonna cheat a little bit just to
37:55 - get some of this data in here so it'll
37:57 - be slightly different when we do it you
38:00 - know for real but we'll need that we
38:06 - have a spot for label no we don't okay
38:11 - so above all these tabs need let's do an
38:18 - h2 and this is going to be we're gonna
38:24 - say course data zero title rendered
38:46 - laughter right this course data oh shoot
38:53 - is it not
39:04 - of course they've
39:11 - there we go of course data zero right
39:15 - because remember that's an array and
39:19 - then we're gonna put its title dot
39:23 - rendered okay so this should display the
39:28 - title and we can I we can test that out
39:37 - right away just to make sure it's
39:39 - working cool here we go here's our title
39:47 - all right cool
39:50 - maybe you don't want it to look exactly
39:52 - like that but for now at least we're
39:53 - getting the data here right so we have
39:57 - that data and for these tab labels for
40:01 - now I'm just gonna leave them as is and
40:06 - what we want to go to now is this a CF
40:11 - year so we'll have this is gonna be a
40:19 - little bit tricky so within within each
40:26 - of these all right here's how we'll do
40:31 - it
40:32 - so let me let me make some some comments
40:39 - here to keep it straight
40:44 - so we forget that lets just code it
40:50 - alright so we're gonna drop it into into
40:53 - JavaScript script land here with these
40:55 - curly brackets so what we put in here is
40:57 - going to be JavaScript so we're gonna
40:58 - take course data zero and we're gonna
41:05 - say dot a CF and then within that dot a
41:11 - CF will have year spring semester
41:18 - forces
41:25 - that's actually kind of weird do I only
41:27 - have two years I must have picked one
41:32 - that only had two years all right not a
41:34 - problem we're only gonna have two years
41:36 - for this one we can always yeah let's
41:42 - just copy and paste this data more
41:46 - because I'd really like to have all four
41:48 - years so let's see there we go so let's
41:59 - just add in another two years there we
42:05 - go okay so we're gonna remove this stuff
42:13 - and in here we'll go dot year right and
42:22 - year is an array of objects so we can
42:26 - say dot map is that year years it is
42:32 - year okay so we'll just say we're gonna
42:36 - say year and we're gonna make an arrow
42:41 - function here and then whatever we have
42:45 - inside of this arrow function is going
42:49 - to be automatically returned so what we
42:52 - want to return automatically then is
42:57 - it's actually this this value equals
43:02 - right so let's copy this for now
43:16 - is it going to let me do that opening
43:18 - curly brackets let's let's put in see if
43:26 - this this helps so we're gonna put in
43:28 - some parens here which will basically
43:34 - keep up with this Otto returning let's
43:38 - see
43:45 - I put my friend in the wrong place so
43:49 - you don't want it there I want it we're
43:55 - here yeah and then one about this one
44:08 - oh man he's uh you're starting to get
44:12 - crazy all right so this should be yeah
44:16 - these two should match up all right I'm
44:19 - not getting the air anymore
44:20 - great
44:33 - who
44:39 - [Music]
45:02 - all right not sure what's going on there
45:11 - don't know why it doesn't like that
45:17 - might not be able to do brackets right
45:22 - after so and I might not I not need to
45:29 - do brackets right after I could do
45:57 - alright let's get rid of this for now
46:16 - to have is so within this arrow function
46:53 - I still need disprin all those
47:04 - formatting is getting me it's just like
47:13 - it's just crazy today to figure out okay
47:21 - so and then that we have and then I
47:25 - should have okay so these are reversed
47:34 - okay but then now
47:55 - I see
48:29 - no trailing spaces not allowed okay
48:33 - it's that work huh are we good all right
48:55 - all right cool okay so this is actually
48:58 - working it looks like it's not working
49:00 - but I'll explain this in a second
49:02 - so it's looping through each it's
49:06 - looping through that data and since we
49:08 - have four objects in the year array we
49:11 - have this four times right now why is it
49:15 - doing all the class stuff because we
49:17 - haven't actually plugged in any of the
49:19 - data yet right but this just shows our
49:22 - loop is working it's looping through the
49:23 - data correctly
49:24 - all right so it's always good to test
49:27 - things like as often as you possibly can
49:30 - because then it's way easier to figure
49:33 - out what went wrong if you know like
49:35 - okay I only changed this one line well
49:38 - if you go through and change 50 lines
49:40 - and then try to figure out where the
49:41 - problem was
49:42 - it's a lot harder to debug right all
49:46 - right so now that we have that let's
49:50 - change this to year and index so what
49:56 - I'd like to have in here is just call it
50:03 - index so it's really obvious so when you
50:06 - use map your second your variable
50:13 - whatever here is going to be your index
50:16 - number so we need the index here because
50:18 - we want to put that value in here okay
50:22 - so that's going to match up to each tab
50:25 - having its value and that's tied in with
50:28 - our state and that's how we know when we
50:30 - click on a tab it changes the state all
50:33 - right and that value determines what
50:35 - content is shown all right so each
50:38 - container corresponds to one item in
50:43 - that that index one item in that array
50:45 - so let's switch this up and call this
50:48 - index okay so that's going to get the
50:52 - index variable now and then down here
50:55 - we'll have this is where it's gonna get
50:59 - tricky we're gonna have some some nested
51:02 - Maps here so within this this container
51:08 - div we have to well within the the grid
51:15 - container actually which can we take out
51:18 - this div I think we can I think we
51:23 - needed this div before but we do not
51:25 - need it and great so we can just go with
51:29 - this grid and the lines are just for
51:32 - indentation
51:33 - let's pick there we go
51:37 - okay so within our great container we
51:42 - have two sections right to grid items
51:48 - and these represent our two columns so
51:54 - for each column this we're gonna have I
51:59 - I think that we're always gonna have
52:04 - these two columns so what we'll do is
52:09 - we'll leave the columns and we'll leave
52:11 - the grid items in here and we'll leave
52:14 - the section and we even you leave the UL
52:17 - and we'll leave the headers so we can
52:22 - then go through and say year and we can
52:33 - go with the index right
52:42 - all right so we want to use the the
52:44 - index value right to go right to that
52:48 - that object in the Year array that we're
52:52 - dealing with what is it is so sweet so
52:53 - good there we go and then within that
52:58 - let's check our data so we get the right
53:01 - place so right now we're in year and
53:03 - let's assume we're on 0 in the index so
53:07 - in this first object now we want to say
53:10 - fall semester courses right in fall
53:14 - semester courses actually you know what
53:19 - we right now don't have data for the
53:21 - titles
53:34 - all right so we can hard code these
53:36 - actually we're gonna hard code them now
53:38 - if we come upon a use case where we need
53:41 - to put something different then maybe we
53:43 - can we can do that but I believe we can
53:45 - hard code this so and I messed up the
53:51 - braces I just saw yeah so that wouldn't
53:54 - have worked as I wrote it anyway but we
53:57 - can put in for fall semester and then
54:06 - let's add let's add this here so we can
54:14 - do spring semester and like I said I
54:21 - think this should work for everywhere
54:23 - where we use this if not we can always
54:25 - go back in here and make these variables
54:28 - and add that in as an option for users
54:31 - to enter into our WordPress you know
54:34 - content management and then we'll grab
54:36 - that with the rest of our data as well
54:38 - but for now it should work now here is
54:41 - where we need another map okay so we
54:45 - want to map through and I should just
54:47 - get rid of all these we're gonna map
54:50 - through these these allies so we're
54:55 - gonna go back into JavaScript land and
54:57 - we're gonna say Year and here's what
55:02 - we're gonna want to use that index and
55:06 - then we're gonna say dot and what was it
55:12 - fall semester courses
55:17 - and dot map and now we'll say course all
55:29 - right of that arrow function and we can
55:33 - just have the Li and put in see the data
55:44 - course
55:53 - why is it like this
55:55 - missing key oh yeah I definitely need a
55:58 - key prop and for the key prop I'm just
56:01 - gonna put it in course because we don't
56:04 - we don't have anything else the courses
56:06 - should be unique they're not they're not
56:13 - gonna be unique
56:15 - they'll be unique according to that
56:20 - particular map right that so you can
56:24 - also you can do a lot of different
56:26 - things for your key but for now this is
56:27 - what I'm going to use for this
56:29 - particular key I guess it wouldn't be a
56:35 - bad idea to just do course and let's go
56:39 - plus index
56:47 - okay we'll do it like that all right
56:52 - great and then we can copy and paste
56:54 - that down here and just change this to
56:58 - your spring assuming I didn't a mess
57:02 - right yep spring semester courses okay
57:06 - let's save that see if I if I did it
57:09 - right and the layers down here so far
57:12 - that's good
57:13 - whoops fall semester courses of
57:16 - undefined all right what's undefined so
57:20 - year index and I forgot to put a CF so
57:26 - no wait no a CF is within the year so it
57:30 - shouldn't work it just should have
57:58 - maybe
58:12 - is that the first time we used our index
58:15 - I thought we use index here at words
58:35 - maybe let me check my timer only have
58:41 - another minute left maybe I have this
58:45 - backwards
58:46 - maybe index should be first I don't
58:49 - think so but don't take a second to try
58:53 - it yeah that was it
58:59 - I think well let me double-check okay
59:27 - well what am I getting nothing gave me
59:30 - no data all right here we go can are you
59:32 - property fall semester courses of
59:34 - undefined let's make let's clear this
59:39 - out and give it a refresh
59:50 - all right this week
59:57 - all right well my time is up let me give
60:00 - it a five-minute break and then we'll go
60:02 - back to it so we'll debug that let me
60:09 - come back and I need to keep an eye ok
60:11 - I'm tying on on time I need to leave in
60:16 - an hour so I'd say an hour is plenty of
60:18 - time for us I'm gonna scroll back up to
60:24 - where I left off in the chat and just
60:26 - keep on going
60:37 - Phoenix's how do I get the difference
60:40 - between my github repo and my local repo
60:43 - I tried get diff master and they
60:45 - returned nothing and then get pulled two
60:49 - changes does it tell you if you if you
60:58 - do get status
60:59 - I don't know cuz I'm not I'm in sync
61:05 - with with this one otherwise I checked I
61:09 - don't remember offhand git status might
61:12 - let you know if you're ahead or behind
61:14 - the master branch but I'm not 100% sure
61:17 - on that Christopher says you should
61:24 - install plugins that automatically
61:25 - import files you need so that you do not
61:27 - have to keep looking stuff up all the
61:29 - time you know what I I have a plug-in
61:35 - like that installed on my laptop I think
61:38 - so cuz I thought I had it installed
61:40 - obviously I don't here so it must be on
61:42 - my laptop so yeah I'll just I need to
61:47 - have that in there it's not a huge deal
61:50 - normally but it definitely does save a
61:51 - little bit of time Stephen says stop
62:00 - yawning get yourself some coffee I had
62:02 - coffee I just I drank the last bit of it
62:05 - but I also have G fuel so maybe I just
62:09 - I'll drink some of that right now
62:24 - Stephen says just Twitter message to you
62:27 - some of the sites that I built check
62:29 - them out let me know what you think if
62:31 - the stream sees it's cool
62:33 - alright cool off to check these up see
62:37 - the messages
62:38 - oh hey also I forgot to mention I was on
62:42 - my first podcast and it was they put it
62:48 - out today so I did the podcast interview
62:52 - last week but if you want to check it
62:55 - out just go to my Twitter I believe my
62:57 - Twitter is linked in the description go
62:59 - to my Twitter I did retweet the the
63:03 - tweet that announced the podcast so
63:06 - check it out if you get a chance let me
63:07 - know what you think it's the this old
63:09 - app podcast
63:18 - alright I'm ringing up some of those
63:20 - websites on my other screen here all
63:27 - right let me go through while those load
63:29 - let me go through the other questions
63:41 - world says why doesn't process and dot
63:46 - note him ever work for me I always have
63:49 - to hard code a port 3000 or something
63:51 - I'm not exactly sure I think I would
63:54 - probably need more information to try to
63:57 - figure out why that that's not working
64:01 - all right innocence I'm doing well I'm
64:04 - happy to see you
64:05 - yeah for sure I'm happy to see you in
64:07 - here to cat D says what happened to your
64:12 - wrist did you get carpal tunnel no it's
64:15 - actually I don't think it's carpal
64:16 - tunnel but so last July so a year ago I
64:25 - was in a swimming pool with my kids and
64:28 - I was throwing them like up over my head
64:30 - as high as I could right
64:32 - they loved it my wife did not love it
64:35 - but I just kept throwing them and
64:38 - throwing them and my arms are getting
64:39 - really tired so I went to throw one of
64:41 - them and my muscles were just way too
64:43 - relaxed and my wrist just bent back
64:46 - right so you know they were like sitting
64:48 - right here my wrist bent back and I just
64:51 - felt its pain and I'm like I'm fine you
64:55 - know so I just kept going right it hurt
64:57 - a little bit but I just kept throwing
64:58 - them and I let it go for a long time and
65:01 - thought it'll get better
65:03 - finally after like months I went to see
65:06 - a doctor got x-rays they couldn't figure
65:09 - out what it was sent me to a physical
65:11 - therapy I did physical therapy for weeks
65:14 - maybe months
65:16 - I don't remember didn't get better they
65:18 - sent me for more I think it was an MRI
65:22 - after that couldn't figure out what
65:24 - happened gave me an injection that made
65:28 - me feel better for about two weeks and
65:30 - then I said all right well I'm just I'm
65:34 - gonna let it go I'm too busy now because
65:36 - the next step was surgery and I say love
65:38 - you know I have too much going on so I
65:41 - let it go for months before I contacted
65:43 - the doctor again it takes forever to get
65:45 - in to see this doctor because the doctor
65:47 - is in Pittsburgh and if I go to
65:51 - Pittsburgh to see the doctor my
65:52 - insurance won't cover it but like once a
65:54 - month the doc
65:55 - comes to where I live Steubenville and
65:57 - if I see him when he comes to
66:00 - Steubenville my insurance covers it so
66:02 - every time I go to make an appointment
66:03 - with the surgeon I have to wait like two
66:07 - months to get in so went back to him and
66:14 - finally said okay let's do the surgery
66:16 - so then to try to schedule the surgery
66:18 - of course took forever so I'd schedule
66:21 - it like I don't know like four months in
66:23 - advance or something crazy so anyway
66:26 - they're gonna go in and just try to
66:29 - figure out what's wrong with my wrist so
66:31 - I think they're gonna cut my wrist open
66:32 - put a little camera in there figure out
66:33 - what's wrong and then I don't know what
66:35 - will happen if it's if it's minor and
66:37 - they can fix it right then they're gonna
66:39 - fix it so I'm I don't know what to
66:42 - expect in terms of recovery time or
66:45 - because they just haven't been able to
66:46 - figure out what's what's actually wrong
66:48 - with it so anyway sorry for the long
66:51 - story of my my wrist hurting but I just
66:58 - I mean I it may be that I can type in
67:00 - everything after it I don't really know
67:03 - just have no idea what what to expect
67:15 - all right cool i actually got through
67:18 - everything i went over a little bit on
67:20 - time here let's reset this timer and
67:22 - we'll do I don't know if we'll need this
67:25 - whole Pomodoro session or not but we'll
67:28 - reset it just in case I can't get this
67:31 - working and I see gifted fingers says
67:35 - hello from Detroit hey how's it going
67:37 - welcome alright so we were okay
67:52 - it wasn't finding the data correct is
67:57 - that the problem
67:58 - yeah no we're not getting errors right
68:03 - we're not even getting errors are we
68:06 - getting errors here I thought we'd get
68:11 - an error message
68:21 - that's weird all right let me check what
68:23 - I have here okay so this part no it's
68:29 - not even working returned all right it
68:38 - did work before I put this in this in it
68:47 - it did work right it displayed things
68:50 - four times
69:13 - I see okay all right let me think about
69:19 - this
69:34 - okay so I don't
70:01 - all right let's let's see if there's
70:04 - anything there at all
70:06 - so inspected just went close to yours
70:25 - alright looks like there's nothing else
70:28 - there at all
70:29 - let's check react
71:14 - I so index
71:25 - sexy a little bit odd
71:34 - hmmm alright so I think the issue is
71:38 - with what we're doing here let's let's
71:44 - just take this out quickly just to
71:46 - verify that that is actually where the
71:49 - the issue is can I read fall semester
71:58 - courses I'm undefined
72:14 - Christopher Brown says you have index
72:16 - and year in the wrong spots okay so we
72:19 - did we did flip this oh that's right
72:22 - okay so I forgot that we flipped that
72:24 - just to test it out and I don't think
72:27 - that was the problem I was like that
72:36 - yeah the same same thing
72:49 - hmm
73:04 - missing key prop yeah I should put a key
73:12 - prop here and we can just call this I
73:24 - really wanted to be
73:47 - oh okay Christopher you you are right
73:54 - I don't think we need to do index so I'm
74:00 - not sure what I was thinking let's see
74:02 - if that makes a difference objects are
74:10 - not Valadez react shallow found objects
74:12 - with keys of course 48
74:33 - oh okay that's an object can just do
74:36 - course it needs to be wait a second
74:39 - Oh course dot course I need to of course
74:45 - dark horse
75:08 - oh yeah okay so we got them now
75:12 - all right yeah good good eye on that
75:15 - Christopher I remember putting that year
75:22 - in there but I can't remember why I did
75:33 - yeah it's at some point I thought you're
75:36 - just gonna I don't know what I was
75:37 - thinking but anyway yeah we don't the
75:42 - whole point of the map is that you don't
75:45 - have to mess with like manually doing
75:48 - the the index on those things anyway all
75:58 - right so let's try what we had again
76:02 - over here which was value so we had this
76:10 - return and then with in the return we
76:14 - were trying to get value you goes index
76:21 - and
76:30 - and then we're trying to return whatever
76:33 - that is
76:37 - okay so spaces inside so we're trying to
76:47 - find out if the value is equal to the
76:51 - index then we're gonna render that now
76:55 - I'm not I don't think this is gonna work
76:58 - but we'll try whoa it worked awesome
77:06 - all right that's really cool what I was
77:09 - afraid would happen is that it would
77:11 - take when it rendered this it would just
77:13 - say the value of index is zero so we'll
77:18 - render here but then the next time
77:20 - through the value of index actually
77:33 - now that I think about it this worked
77:39 - out really well and I don't I don't know
77:44 - why I worked out so well
77:50 - you thought you lose index yeah I don't
77:54 - know anyway it works that's all that
77:58 - matters
78:04 - so it works how I hoped it would or not
78:07 - how I thought it would okay all right
78:14 - what's the key yeah
78:25 - all right so right now we are having an
78:27 - issue with with our keys with the same
78:31 - keys so that's happening because we we
78:35 - do have these duplicate courses so and
78:38 - you know we're not gonna get away from
78:40 - that because we have elective elective
78:43 - elective and I think we'll probably end
78:44 - up having a lot of stuff like this so we
78:48 - need to use something else as the key
78:54 - like what we could use you see in the
79:00 - data you know we're not really getting
79:05 - anything that could help us in terms of
79:08 - each each one of these like a unique ID
79:11 - or anything so we could do cages UUID
79:32 - you I there we go
79:56 - okay so we can use UUID to create a
80:01 - unique ID so let's try that and Wow
80:10 - there are a lot of versions of this
80:12 - anyway
80:15 - let's let's install this so let's go and
80:21 - for yarn add UUID and now we should be
80:29 - able to bring in UUID require
80:49 - I don't know what's up with all these
80:50 - different versions our version one is a
80:57 - time stand
81:00 - my name is phase version four is random
81:11 - he says
81:18 - what happened aversion to the 1 3 4 5
81:34 - all right
81:40 - he says view has UUID built in each
81:42 - component oh that's pretty cool all
81:47 - right
81:57 - that's squares values and
82:08 - would you stir this in to the key
82:20 - see this works
82:37 - cool at work so we have unique IDs our
82:44 - unique keys let's check and react so our
82:50 - key is we've taken the name of the
82:55 - course we could probably get rid of that
82:57 - that's that's a loan key these should be
82:58 - unique so we can see each one of these
83:02 - so I'm looking up here in the corner
83:03 - each one of these is a unique ID so
83:09 - let's do it just to clean things up a
83:11 - little bit let's take out course and now
83:19 - we just have this unique ID cool and
83:24 - that gets rid of all those ugly warnings
83:28 - and in the console cool alright so we
83:36 - have our data the the data that we have
83:38 - here in this format is the exact format
83:41 - that we will get it and if we go with
83:44 - the REST API which is our fallback
83:47 - ideally we're going to try to get this
83:49 - data through graph QL but having trouble
83:52 - working with modifying the PHP of our
83:57 - plugins to make that happen
83:59 - so this is our fallback so we're pretty
84:04 - much all set the only thing that we'd
84:07 - really have to change is we would have
84:11 - to change the course data instead of
84:16 - just going with course state of 0 we
84:19 - would kind of have another layer of map
84:22 - right so we would map over every object
84:26 - in course data essentially we'd wrap
84:28 - this entire thing in another map and so
84:33 - we could have potentially have you know
84:35 - multiple of all of this you know on the
84:39 - same the same page so that would really
84:44 - be the only thing we need to change and
84:47 - so now let's let's
84:50 - get some some styling so I want to just
84:54 - shrink this down to a smaller width so
84:58 - we get an idea how this looks on mobile
85:01 - and the first thing I'm noticing is I I
85:06 - don't really know that I want this to be
85:08 - a in h2 I think that's kind of like
85:15 - overkill what's up here I'm not able I'm
85:24 - not able to move yeah let's let's switch
85:28 - it up and yeah that's looking okay there
85:32 - we go
85:33 - all right so if we actually do go into
85:35 - device simulator here all right it's
85:40 - it's better there we go
85:45 - so it just does move all right so here's
85:51 - what I'm seeing this could probably
85:55 - stand to drop down
86:02 - - an h3 and then we could drop these two
86:06 - H fours and I think that would make
86:11 - sense with the the hierarchy of the of
86:13 - the page so let's do that now let's get
86:19 - rid of that I don't need that
86:27 - alright yes we're gonna make this in h3
86:34 - and then drop these ones to H fours and
86:43 - let's see what that gives us now okay
86:51 - alright that's okay I think that's
86:54 - that's good
87:01 - I think this is way too much space in
87:03 - between these two so let's do that and I
87:07 - also want to get rid of these bullet
87:11 - points so now we're going to actually
87:13 - get into our styles so we can on these
87:22 - allies we can turn it's a style
87:35 - yeah maker Styles up here styles dot
87:48 - list item and now let's go up here and
87:53 - make let's remove this roots and make
87:58 - list item right so this is one way to do
88:04 - styles in react okay so it's gonna be a
88:12 - javascript object and we're gonna put in
88:18 - what is very similar to normal CSS but a
88:22 - little bit different so list style
88:27 - I believe that's that's what this is
88:30 - list outside none let's see if that
88:36 - works great that works so we've gotten
88:42 - rid of this and then we can see let's
88:45 - switch back to the element here and we
88:47 - can now see on our allies oops
88:56 - there we go
89:00 - upon our allies it has lists outside
89:03 - none so it's actually transferred that
89:06 - style to an inline style that's pretty
89:13 - cool and it's the fact that it's an
89:15 - inline style is really cool in terms of
89:18 - like performance when it when all this
89:21 - is rendered server-side and the user
89:24 - gets that first load and that that first
89:26 - load they get is going to be just
89:28 - server-side rendered straight HTML you
89:32 - know it's you're not waiting for a
89:36 - stylesheet to load to get this so I mean
89:39 - it definitely has some advantages that
89:42 - way and it doesn't require you to
89:46 - manually go in and add those inline
89:48 - Styles alright cool so we have that the
89:51 - second thing we want to do is we're
89:53 - going to reduce the the padding just
89:56 - kind of all around right I don't think
89:58 - we need we don't need as much padding
90:01 - here we don't need as much here and we
90:04 - don't need as much here so what is our
90:11 - issue maybe the section oh you know what
90:17 - I forgot to add in section here so we're
90:23 - dealing with different markup for these
90:27 - and it shouldn't be different ok there
90:31 - we go let's see if that made any
90:32 - difference
90:34 - doesn't look like it for style okay so
90:39 - let's make some some changes here in dev
90:44 - tools and then we can transfer them over
90:46 - in our component so there we go so these
90:51 - you elves have quite a bit of of margin
90:59 - or I mean sorry padding where are we
91:04 - getting that padding from
91:13 - there we go yeah we're gonna set that
91:17 - padding to zero and let's see what that
91:22 - looks like
91:23 - whoops yeah let's sit up adding to zero
91:29 - now for are you ELLs so it'll be the
91:39 - first thing we add here
91:41 - so are you ELLs are gonna get style just
91:46 - like the Allies then we'll say style
91:50 - equals Styles dot list and list see
92:02 - we're just adding another item here and
92:13 - so now it should apply to both of these
92:15 - yep there we go and what is giving us
92:21 - this huge amount of padding here on top
92:24 - of it's not section all right so ul does
92:29 - come with some margin that we could
92:31 - probably get rid of who wins that H tag
92:34 - has quite a bit of margin so
92:42 - I wonder what would be better you know
92:48 - what let's try to get rid of the margin
92:49 - on these lists first just because we
92:54 - have it already set up this new margin:0
92:58 - nope we need a comma okay so that
93:04 - brought us closer but I still think this
93:07 - h4 is just way too much padding both
93:15 - above and below I'm sorry margin both
93:17 - above and below so let's see margin
93:29 - let's say from like four pixels is zero
93:38 - that's better I think we might be able
93:41 - to go down
93:53 - okay what
94:02 - okay and then these these days which are
94:06 - grids they also have padding
94:16 - alright but let's let's throw that
94:21 - margin on here so let's say list header
94:28 - is going to be margin for see if we can
94:39 - do it like this for zero
94:49 - it's not working
94:53 - no it didn't work because I didn't put
94:58 - it on there didn't actually give any any
95:03 - style to this age for style Michael I
95:13 - just saw that you mentioned to me about
95:14 - the section tag thing I'm sorry I didn't
95:16 - see that but thanks for for letting me
95:21 - know about it okay so our style is
95:31 - Tedder oops I forgot the equals can
95:36 - always tell when you did something wrong
95:38 - when you get weird highlighting whoops
95:40 - and that's supposed to be Stiles not
95:49 - something just made a noise use
95:52 - messaging me
96:00 - make sure it's not for work I don't
96:04 - think it is so they were good okay
96:11 - whoa okay it worked but that's not
96:16 - exactly what I wanted
96:28 - Oh
96:31 - okay
97:04 - all right maybe we'll decrease on these
97:10 - on these grid items
97:23 - will decrease the bottom padding to zero
97:30 - see how that looks
98:09 - this grid
98:25 - this grid item gonna be that I was patty
98:35 - wasn't it
98:41 - padding-bottom this is easier okay
99:00 - all right it's better I I don't really
99:03 - like the padding here let's quickly
99:06 - check how this is affected okay okay so
99:19 - not not terrible probably just need a
99:25 - little bit more here but I think what
99:28 - I'll do to achieve that is add add to
99:35 - whatever this container is for our tabs
99:38 - and we'll add in margin bottom and let's
99:52 - say a pixels oh no did that move the it
99:59 - moved the underline down okay so that's
100:01 - not what we want what we need then is
100:04 - perhaps the container
100:19 - the grid container is what needs a
100:27 - padding top of 8 pixels there we go
100:31 - that's a lot nicer so let's do that
100:42 - this grid container it's gonna give
100:45 - we're gonna put a padding top of 8 8
100:55 - pixels and there's that good there we go
101:05 - style
101:13 - Styles thoughtless gridded container
101:28 - all right I the only other thing that I
101:33 - think would be good to do is move these
101:39 - tabs over so I'm not sure what's no
101:49 - that's not it it's the the tabs and
101:55 - stuff there we are okay this is what we
101:57 - want
102:10 - yeah what is this oh it's a space for
102:14 - the button that's why
102:21 - the skier rid of this buttons and
102:28 - can I go none I don't know if none is
102:32 - the right thing to put on there we'll
102:34 - see in a second
102:43 - okay that's that's better
102:54 - okay this is acceptable right now I
102:57 - wouldn't say like it's perfect but it's
103:01 - definitely acceptable okay sorry about
103:06 - that I definitely went over my 25-minute
103:08 - timer on that one but it was just so
103:10 - close to getting it to - look I don't I
103:15 - I think presentable at least at some
103:20 - point you amazed my experience there's
103:23 - always something some adjustment you can
103:25 - make at some point you just have to say
103:27 - like okay this is good enough and and
103:31 - just stop because otherwise you like
103:36 - nitpick at these tiny details and if you
103:39 - have the time on the project to do that
103:41 - that's okay but I definitely don't okay
103:51 - great so before I go to the rest of the
103:56 - questions I want to commit this
104:09 - so we'll do it's good we we just worked
104:12 - on this file but we did also change
104:16 - these and we added this one so you'll
104:18 - get ad will do yarn CM and that's our
104:24 - little helper to help us make nice
104:26 - nicely formatted you commit messages so
104:29 - this is a new feature and let's say it
104:32 - is add create sample schedule component
104:53 - and no breaking changes it does effect
104:57 - an open issue and this would be
104:59 - regarding issue number 102 I think
105:02 - that's what we had yesterday we'll go
105:04 - with that and that's it it should run
105:08 - through all the tests do some Auto
105:09 - formatting some testing and then we'll
105:11 - be able to push that up and then all the
105:14 - code will be available and get up if you
105:15 - want to check that out it will be there
105:18 - for you all open source free for you to
105:21 - do whatever you need to with it
105:22 - awesome everything worked and would it
105:25 - get push and that's that the next step
105:29 - notice I didn't close that issue because
105:31 - we still have one more step and that's
105:33 - actually pulling in real data so that
105:36 - you know that was real data at least
105:39 - part of it what we got was real but we
105:41 - need to dynamically pull that in based
105:44 - on the URL so that'll be a little bit
105:50 - more tricky than what we dealt with
105:52 - today but that would be the next step so
105:57 - I may or may not stream that step we'll
106:00 - just we'll see how it goes alright let
106:03 - me get to the chat and answer all your
106:06 - remaining questions
106:11 - oh wow not that many questions that okay
106:18 - that's actually not bad because I do
106:21 - have to leave in maybe 15 minutes or
106:26 - less all right Michael Michael ed the
106:32 - same idea with as me add the bottom
106:35 - margin to the tab header yeah
106:37 - unfortunately it it didn't work and the
106:40 - reason being like this seems like it's a
106:42 - border but it's not actually a bottom
106:44 - border this is an entirely separate
106:46 - element HTML element and that's how we
106:49 - get this effect of it moving
106:51 - right if this was just the border on the
106:54 - bottom it would just immediately move
106:57 - there would be no transition but we're
107:00 - seeing this transition here right and
107:04 - that's because it's it's actually you
107:07 - know an element you're kind of moving
107:09 - through there so if it was just a border
107:13 - margin bottom would have actually worked
107:21 - okay let's see Stephen says two days of
107:27 - to our streams what what don't forget to
107:30 - check out my sites just want to know if
107:31 - I'm progressing well I do have a
107:33 - creative department so I'm strictly web
107:36 - design okay cool yeah well I'm gonna
107:39 - take a look at those maybe right now on
107:41 - the on the stream all right Christopher
107:45 - Brent brown said you should do a
107:46 - material list yeah you know what we
107:49 - checked out yesterday using the list
107:51 - component and material UI and we decided
107:55 - not to because it thought we could just
107:58 - use the simple UL li if there's some
108:05 - reason why using the list component for
108:08 - material you I would make more sense
108:09 - here I'm definitely open to it but for
108:14 - now I just didn't think that I I needed
108:17 - that
108:24 - okay let me check out these sites
108:32 - all right these are cool I'm gonna bring
108:34 - them over onto the screen so we can all
108:36 - check out these sites so this is these
108:37 - are Stephens sites
108:40 - let's just let's make them fullscreen
108:49 - this one okay cool
108:54 - so Wow I really like these alright and
108:58 - these are WordPress awesome so
109:01 - stephenie's are then like WordPress
109:04 - theme theme work very cool
109:24 - cool
109:29 - nice this is nice theme for for
109:31 - Pittsburgh new definitely has those
109:35 - Pittsburgh sports teams colors going on
109:38 - there like that and
109:57 - that's cool I like this map
110:09 - you know I noticed though I'm not sure
110:11 - if it's something up with with my
110:13 - computer or whatever but it does that
110:18 - there's no labels
110:20 - there's no labels to see what the fill
110:23 - in here which I mean I can based on the
110:26 - auto you know complete it does it but
110:29 - and then this text is really small but
110:36 - other than that I really like I like how
110:39 - this looks I love this call-to-action
110:43 - button up here the shadows on that are
110:48 - nice and I love this style button as
110:50 - well very cool cool icons I even like
111:04 - the e these have like a subtle shadow
111:14 - cool once I love these V style button I
111:17 - always call these inverted buttons I
111:19 - don't remember where I got that from but
111:21 - I always I kind of like that
111:32 - very cool that's a nice background I
111:34 - said that's a nice touch
111:40 - really really cool
111:41 - Wow so you did a site for a company in
111:44 - Houston Portland and Pittsburgh all over
111:49 - the place huh that's that's awesome
111:53 - anyway Stephen I'm super impressed with
111:56 - these sites they're beautiful they're
111:59 - really nice so that's great that's
112:08 - really great font size 16
112:17 - the only thing I would say is maybe
112:19 - consider bumping the font size up a bit
112:22 - on maybe to 18 if it fits if it works
112:27 - out I know this I'm on a really big
112:28 - screen right now so this is probably not
112:31 - the same experience that most users
112:34 - would have on a on a standard screen if
112:36 - there even is such a thing but that's
112:39 - really the only thing that I would say
112:41 - is that the font looks a little small
112:42 - like I love this size font I think
112:45 - that's great but these fonts look at
112:47 - just a bit small wow so cool so I'm not
112:54 - gonna go through all the other stuff in
112:56 - the sites but usually you put the most
113:00 - work into the front page anyway but wow

114:03 - effect if I would if I can recommend
114:07 - something with that effect
114:10 - I might just slow it down a little bit I
114:16 - really like it but I think it would be
114:19 - cooler if it was a little bit slower and
114:22 - that may just be like my extreme motion
114:25 - sickness coming into play here that it's
114:26 - just too fast for me but other than that
114:31 - that's cool I love that I'm assuming on
114:38 - mobile that it would be so I don't see

115:11 - mobile click but it's having some issues
115:13 - as well yeah I noticed it's yeah but I
115:16 - mean I think it's overall the look is
115:19 - just really really really good I think
115:23 - that's amazing look for like for those
115:25 - particular businesses and what what that
115:29 - type of business needs to convey to
115:31 - their audience I think it's perfect the
115:33 - sites look really like upscale very
115:37 - clean and I think that that definitely
115:40 - appeals to who it seems like they're
115:43 - their target audience would be oh I
