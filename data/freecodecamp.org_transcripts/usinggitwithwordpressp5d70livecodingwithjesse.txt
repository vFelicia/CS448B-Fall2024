00:08 - hey everybody
00:10 - welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:12 - jesse
00:13 - and i apologize for being a few minutes
00:15 - late i got a phone call
00:17 - right before the stream started i should
00:19 - have never even answered it but it was
00:21 - from a car rental place and
00:24 - i'd rented a car last week to drive down
00:26 - to
00:27 - uh
00:28 - revolution conf and
00:31 - there were some issues with the car
00:33 - rental
00:34 - um in terms of like
00:36 - there was a misunderstanding and i ended
00:38 - up getting charged more than i should
00:39 - have gotten charged so i did really want
00:41 - to answer it and clear that up
00:44 - so anyway
00:47 - good news for me is that everything is
00:49 - going to be cleared up uh and i i
00:52 - definitely apologize for uh
00:55 - um
00:57 - for the lateness of the stream start
01:01 - all right so
01:03 - uh i just want to take
01:06 - let me take a minute here i'm streaming
01:07 - from home so i want to uh make sure the
01:10 - stream's okay so let me know if
01:11 - anything's weird with the stream if
01:12 - there's a delay
01:14 - right now it says the health is good
01:16 - um
01:17 - but
01:18 - i have more things running on my
01:19 - computer than i normally do when i try
01:21 - to stream
01:22 - so
01:24 - so far everything's running good just
01:26 - let me know
01:27 - uh i'm not gonna play spotify on my
01:29 - computer i'm gonna hook it up on my
01:30 - phone so
01:32 - i'm gonna set this up right now
01:35 - and
01:38 - play this
01:41 - okay
01:43 - um
01:48 - yeah
01:49 - and then
01:51 - this is somewhat humorous i i went to
01:53 - start the stream because i was in a
01:54 - hurry because i was late and then i
01:56 - looked in obs and i could see myself and
01:58 - realized that i did not have a shirt on
02:00 - so
02:02 - then i had to grab a shirt really quick
02:04 - before i could start
02:06 - so i had already started the stream done
02:08 - the preview on youtube and you have to
02:10 - hit one more button for it to go live so
02:12 - i almost had hit the the third button
02:15 - um
02:17 - not you can really see much more than
02:19 - this up but still i i didn't want to
02:21 - scandalize anybody
02:25 - all right i'm going to check the live
02:27 - chat real quick before we get started uh
02:29 - and i'm going to start out by explaining
02:31 - what we're doing and why we're doing it
02:32 - and then we'll get right into it
02:34 - uh just a disclaimer i've never done
02:37 - this before so this is going to be one
02:38 - of those streams where we learn together
02:41 - and i'm expecting for it not to work
02:43 - right away
02:45 - uh so we'll just we'll see how it goes
02:48 - uh let's so if you were saying hi
02:51 - um
02:54 - subbender hi edward says who else is
02:57 - excited i'm definitely excited i i hope
03:00 - some of you are excited too
03:02 - um
03:03 - treasure says hi hey how's it going
03:05 - mildred says uh it's looking good i
03:08 - assume you mean the stream is looking
03:09 - good and not necessarily me but if you
03:11 - did mean me thank you
03:13 - either way thanks
03:17 - jeff said thought you were laying on the
03:18 - floor for a second there yeah actually
03:20 - it does kind of look like i'm laying
03:21 - down it's i'm actually in a recliner and
03:23 - then behind me i just put up a
03:27 - tablecloth
03:28 - i hung them from the ceiling
03:30 - so it kind of encloses me a bit and uh
03:33 - that way if my kids run through here
03:36 - then it's not distracting
03:38 - and you never know there's a bathroom
03:40 - like in the corner there so sometimes
03:42 - the little ones will be so excited that
03:44 - they went on the potty they'll run
03:45 - through here
03:46 - uh without any pants on or anything so
03:50 - just wanted to
03:51 - make sure we keep this pg here
03:54 - uh and
03:56 - family friendly
04:02 - all right
04:03 - let's see
04:06 - i'll just read a few more hellos before
04:08 - we get started
04:11 - carlos says hasn't been able to watch
04:13 - previous episodes because i didn't get
04:15 - home until now good to see you live yeah
04:16 - it's good to have you here live carlos
04:19 - uh let's see
04:21 - harsha says hasn't worked with much with
04:23 - now lately
04:25 - well that's we're actually getting ready
04:27 - to work with now uh
04:29 - so we're not gonna get there today but
04:32 - we're gonna do the prep work for our
04:33 - wordpress installation to get to that
04:35 - point
04:37 - let's see
04:46 - kcb says no pants wednesday i do have
04:49 - pants on well i have shorts on so
04:52 - let's uh
04:57 - all right cool
05:01 - all right let's get started uh first
05:03 - thing i'm gonna do is just give you a
05:04 - quick explanation of what we're doing
05:07 - and i'm gonna paste the link in here for
05:09 - you to follow along with some of the
05:11 - documentation as well
05:15 - let me get that link right now i had it
05:17 - up on my other computer
05:33 - okay
05:35 - i got the link now let me paste this for
05:38 - you
05:39 - i'm gonna paste this here in the live
05:40 - chat if it doesn't work when you click
05:42 - it just try copying and pasting it that
05:43 - usually works
05:45 - and
05:46 - this video is kind of dark i'm gonna
05:48 - brighten my screen it's amazing the
05:50 - difference you you get in the video if
05:52 - you i just brighten my laptop screen
05:55 - uh
05:57 - okay so
06:00 - i'm gonna move this
06:02 - over on my other screen and i'm gonna
06:03 - share my screen with you all so we can
06:06 - all check it out together
06:23 - okay
06:24 - so this is what we're looking at and
06:25 - this is the link that i copied in
06:30 - i um
06:34 - what i'd like to do
06:35 - is set up wordpress in a way that
06:39 - i can track it with get
06:41 - and that i can also deploy it using now
06:47 - so if you've used wordpress press before
06:50 - and if you know anything about now you
06:52 - know that that's
06:53 - it's not going to work right off the bat
06:54 - we definitely have to change some things
06:56 - so this is in anticipation of putting in
06:59 - motion the plan that we talked about on
07:01 - monday uh so that we're gonna separate
07:03 - out that mysql database and all the
07:06 - files uh all the media files from
07:09 - wordpress
07:10 - and then all we'll have left are you
07:13 - know the php
07:14 - files the plugins
07:17 - things like that
07:18 - that's what's going to end up being
07:20 - hosted with now
07:22 - so
07:23 - that's what we're going to work on today
07:24 - we're going to take the actual wordpress
07:26 - files that we've been using and we're
07:29 - going to try to get them into this
07:30 - format
07:32 - and put them up on github
07:36 - so let's dig into this a little bit and
07:38 - just see what's going on
07:39 - so that we can all get an idea of what
07:41 - we need to do
07:45 - so you can see uh we're running you know
07:48 - we have our wp config file which i'm
07:50 - sure we'll have to modify but that's
07:52 - standard
07:53 - um
07:55 - we have this docker file so we check
07:58 - docker this will really give us an idea
07:59 - of like what's going what's going to go
08:02 - on inside this docker container
08:05 - um
08:07 - you see we're doing this curl right if
08:09 - you're not familiar with these commands
08:10 - curl was like going out and like
08:11 - downloading stuff
08:13 - in in this case it's downloading these
08:15 - zip files so
08:17 - you know we're getting latest versions
08:18 - of wordpress uh we're getting some
08:21 - plugins uh
08:23 - secure database connection we're getting
08:25 - a sendgrid plug-in
08:26 - uh wordpress does send emails
08:30 - uh for just some of its administrative
08:32 - tasks
08:34 - uh so we're gonna run that through
08:35 - sendgrid
08:37 - and
08:38 - we should be able to just use the free
08:40 - plan on sendgrid because there's
08:42 - there's not going to be very many emails
08:46 - and we already have sendgrid accounts
08:48 - set up so we won't have to send anything
08:50 - new up for that
08:55 - all right it's using
08:58 - huh
09:00 - sorry
09:02 - so you can see
09:03 - when we run docker it's it is going
09:05 - through all the steps
09:09 - to
09:11 - run wordpress to install and run
09:13 - wordpress uh with nginx
09:17 - so
09:19 - this is really cool we haven't used
09:21 - docker on the show so
09:23 - i mean i'm kind of excited about this
09:27 - and so that's that's what's going to be
09:29 - going on inside the container
09:37 - and let me see if there's anything else
09:41 - that we need to
09:45 - oh you know we ought to check out this
09:46 - config file
09:51 - i guess we check out this run file too
09:59 - okay uh and the config i'm assuming this
10:02 - is going to be a little different than a
10:04 - normal wp config
10:09 - all right see we are going to have to
10:10 - put in
10:14 - some info
10:21 - okay
10:22 - i mean it it actually looks pretty much
10:26 - somewhat normal
10:28 - um okay
10:33 - and i forgot to start with pomodoro as
10:35 - ever i'm sorry about that let's start it
10:37 - now
10:40 - and i'm just gonna keep it on my other
10:42 - screen i already have it there
10:44 - um
10:45 - it'll play a sound in my headphones
10:47 - whenever
10:48 - actu
10:49 - no it won't play us on
10:51 - because i have my headphones plugged
10:52 - into my phone but i'll uh
10:55 - it should give me a notification
11:04 - all right let's see
11:05 - harshit says you need environment
11:07 - variables
11:09 - yes yes thank you uh yeah so
11:13 - we're what we're not going to have
11:17 - on our github repo is our environment
11:18 - variables right because
11:22 - um
11:23 - obviously we don't want the world to
11:25 - know all that stuff
11:26 - uh so
11:28 - i will set that
11:30 - if we get to that point where we get far
11:32 - enough that we need to set these things
11:33 - up
11:34 - then i will definitely do that on my
11:36 - other screen
11:37 - and
11:40 - we'll have to keep them
11:42 - you know elsewhere
11:51 - okay
11:52 - all right harsha's talking about the
11:55 - e flag
11:56 - on now let's see what they have set up
11:59 - for now
12:01 - uh there we go
12:06 - so hard i don't i don't know if you
12:08 - were looking at this or not on your
12:09 - machine but this is the
12:14 - now.json
12:21 - so at least we know what we need
12:30 - all right so
12:32 - what we want to do
12:34 - i guess first
12:38 - did i clone this already
12:43 - i can't remember if i fork this yet or
12:45 - not
12:46 - so let me double check and see if i did
12:48 - fork it yet and then we can get started
12:59 - um let's see
13:01 - i i as i believe i'm pronouncing that
13:04 - right i'm not sure though uh as i see
13:06 - your questions after this pomodoro
13:08 - session i'll i'll come through and
13:09 - answer a bunch of the questions so you
13:10 - can just hold on
13:12 - uh for about 20 minutes or so then
13:15 - i'll answer the questions
13:21 - all right so let's check out
13:26 - my profile
13:33 - and
13:39 - if i did clone it i think i would have
13:41 - cloned it to this organization this fds
13:44 - marcon
13:47 - let's see
13:49 - or i'm i keep saying clone i mean fork
13:51 - sorry
13:56 - there we go i did it's here
13:59 - okay so i'm gonna run from off of this
14:01 - now
14:03 - uh this repository that i forked
14:06 - uh you can see for this main repository
14:08 - it's it's not like it's been updated
14:10 - anytime soon so
14:12 - i don't really need to worry about
14:13 - updating my fork
14:19 - so we can get rid of that
14:20 - and
14:23 - let's
14:25 - let's clone this then
14:32 - and
14:34 - this it may take a few minutes since i'm
14:36 - trying to run
14:37 - obs at the same time
14:41 - but that's okay because that would give
14:43 - me a little bit of time to check out the
14:44 - live chat
14:46 - and i have this really small so i'm
14:48 - gonna make these a bit bigger before i
14:50 - do anything else
14:57 - you go one more
14:59 - it looks really huge on my screen let me
15:01 - know if it's good for for you all
15:04 - uh so i'm gonna do oops i want to get
15:06 - out
15:08 - you know what i don't want to do this
15:10 - in
15:12 - in here
15:13 - let's let's pull up a command line
15:18 - so let's go into here
15:21 - for now
15:27 - okay so i'm in my projects folder uh if
15:31 - if you're doing things with the command
15:32 - line pulling down repos i always find it
15:34 - helpful to create a projects folder so i
15:36 - know where everything is at
15:38 - just keep things clean for me
15:41 - so i'm gonna do a git clone and i'm
15:44 - bringing down
15:44 - [Music]
15:45 - that
15:46 - repo wow super fast okay
15:50 - and we can cd into this
15:53 - it's just wordpress
15:54 - and we can see hey here's all our files
15:57 - now
15:58 - i'm going to open this with visual
15:59 - studio code
16:02 - i know i could have opened up a window
16:04 - and code first but
16:06 - i've just gotten into the habit of doing
16:07 - it this way and i always have my eye
16:09 - term open anyway
16:11 - um so
16:13 - i'm not 100 sure that it's faster but
16:16 - it's easier for me since it's a habit
16:18 - now
16:19 - uh remind me later
16:22 - i've been asking him to remind me later
16:24 - for that survey for months
16:27 - maybe one day i'll actually do it i mean
16:29 - i do want to help i just am always in
16:31 - the middle of something
16:33 - okay so you can see
16:35 - uh now we have all those files right
16:40 - everything that we we ought to have
16:46 - so what we can try to do now
16:51 - is
16:52 - set this up
16:55 - and
16:59 - try to get something running
17:02 - locally uh on the machine
17:05 - so
17:09 - um let me
17:12 - i take you know what i think i may have
17:14 - to set up
17:15 - if this sendgrid stuff is not optional
17:19 - which i
17:21 - it doesn't look like it is how about it
17:24 - i'm going to try to run it without
17:25 - setting up something on sendgrid
17:28 - but if you know what sendgrid is it's
17:30 - like uh an email server
17:32 - so
17:34 - we've done things with sendgrid before
17:37 - it won't be too much of an issue but i
17:39 - think we can save some time and try to
17:40 - do it without sendgrid
17:43 - we'll see if we get an error then we'll
17:45 - set it up but you know it's worth saving
17:47 - like 10 or 15 minutes to try to do it
17:50 - um
17:52 - without sendgrid first since this is
17:55 - you know kind of a
17:57 - a trial run this is the first time we're
17:59 - trying this
18:05 - i'm trying to scan the uh the chat as
18:07 - well just to see our i see i see
18:10 - your comments let's do that now then
18:11 - let's make that dot end file
18:20 - no it didn't
18:22 - i didn't hit the dot hard enough
18:26 - there we go
18:27 - dot
18:29 - okay
18:30 - so our dot end file env is
18:34 - uh
18:35 - where we're going to
18:39 - add in all the stuff that we saw here
18:42 - right the host username all that so let
18:45 - me open this side by side so i get them
18:47 - all
18:49 - and
18:53 - i just want
18:54 - to grab these
18:59 - just so that we have them
19:01 - and take
19:04 - let me take out all these quotation
19:06 - marks we don't need
19:08 - them okay
19:11 - and i don't believe
19:12 - we don't need the commas either no what
19:15 - did i just do
19:17 - there we go
19:22 - all right i don't think we need anything
19:24 - i'm just gonna need what like equals
19:29 - and the equals for all that so at this
19:31 - point i am going to pull this off to
19:35 - another screen
19:39 - let me get
19:42 - let me see if i can open this in another
19:51 - i guess it's not going to let me do that
19:56 - um i just see axel s what's with that
19:59 - end this for um i need all these values
20:02 - to get this up and running
20:04 - so i need to put them in an end file
20:07 - and then now is going to grab them and
20:09 - use them
20:11 - so
20:15 - that's what i need
20:20 - hardship thanks he just reminded me to
20:22 - remove the spaces
20:24 - as well i assume you meant this stuff
20:26 - over here so thank you for that
20:29 - and let me make a new window and pull it
20:32 - over to my other screen
20:42 - and now
20:43 - i should be able to drag this over to my
20:46 - new window and close it here
20:53 - all right cool
20:55 - so
20:59 - let me just open up this
21:01 - just have something else in here we're
21:02 - going to close that and i'll do my best
21:04 - to never show that m-file again
21:11 - let's see
21:14 - uh harshit says is the database set up
21:16 - or will you use the same test database
21:18 - for now i'm going to use the same test
21:19 - database so i don't have
21:22 - the things we talked about in terms of
21:24 - on monday in terms of file storage and
21:26 - database i don't have set up yet because
21:28 - it occurred to me
21:30 - that
21:31 - the school that i work for
21:33 - uses microsoft
21:35 - office
21:36 - uh 365.
21:38 - so i thought it might be a good idea to
21:41 - look into
21:42 - like hey could we use azure for free or
21:44 - for a big discount
21:46 - so
21:47 - the it department is looking into that
21:49 - right now
21:51 - i hope i get an answer back soon
21:54 - if it turns out that we get a really
21:56 - good deal then i may go with uh
21:59 - azure for our database management and
22:02 - our file storage
22:03 - if not i think i'll probably end up
22:05 - going with google
22:08 - uh because
22:09 - from from what i've seen so far i think
22:12 - google will end up being
22:14 - uh a bit cheaper
22:17 - so
22:18 - that's the plan right now
22:19 - if i don't hear anything back by the end
22:21 - of the week i'm i think i'm just gonna
22:23 - go with google stuff
22:26 - because i can't really wait
22:32 - all right let's see
22:35 - i'm gonna grab
22:40 - all right i'm gonna look away from the
22:42 - live chat for a while because i need to
22:45 - the screen space to look up
22:48 - some info about uh my wordpress
22:52 - installation
22:54 - okay so let me see
23:01 - i may have to
23:13 - trying to think how i can get this info
23:15 - quickly uh maybe i'll just ssh into the
23:18 - droplet and bring up the current wp
23:20 - config i just need to get the ip for the
23:23 - droplet
23:38 - all right so
23:40 - i'd rather not show you all my
23:43 - my stuff
23:45 - for this process so i'm gonna just
23:46 - describe it as best i can so right now
23:49 - all i'm doing is just logging into
23:51 - digitalocean it's asking me for my
23:53 - two-factor authentication so
23:56 - uh i just need to get on my phone here
24:00 - and get that
24:04 - i use authy for my authentication
24:12 - and i have a lot of stuff in here it
24:14 - takes me a little while to find it
24:22 - i definitely recommend using two-factor
24:24 - authentication whenever it is available
24:29 - uh
24:30 - definitely better than just using a
24:31 - password
24:34 - okay
24:36 - so let me go in here
24:40 - uh i'm in digitalocean i am i'm on
24:42 - several digitalocean teams
24:45 - so i'm switching to the team that we
24:46 - have for
24:48 - um
24:50 - for this university
24:53 - and
25:05 - we have quite a few droplets in here
25:07 - right now
25:26 - i don't remember what the name of this
25:28 - droplet is
25:42 - i think it's this one
25:44 - let me double check before i start
25:46 - trying to get into this droplet
26:03 - all right
26:04 - let's try i'm gonna try to do some stuff
26:09 - here just to show you
26:13 - let's see
26:15 - do a new tab and
26:20 - let's see
26:23 - i think that's it
26:24 - no that's denied all right hold on a
26:26 - second let me bring this to my other
26:28 - screen
26:40 - okay
27:06 - okay
27:18 - all right so evidently
27:22 - uh i don't think i set this one up but
27:24 - evidently i am not set up as a user oh
27:28 - you know what this was we did the like
27:30 - easy one click setup for this
27:33 - and um
27:37 - so
27:38 - i personally don't have an account like
27:40 - i usually set up but the root account
27:43 - is still active
27:45 - uh now it's not you can't pat get a
27:48 - password it's set up through ssh keys uh
27:50 - which is okay but usually we uh don't
27:53 - use the root account uh for time i'm not
27:56 - gonna set up my own account right now
27:57 - let's just do this with root
27:59 - i have to remember how to get to
28:04 - uh
28:12 - this is how we get to it
28:14 - no i can't remember how to get to where
28:18 - we want to go
28:25 - okay
28:27 - if anybody remembers how to navigate
28:33 - uh file structure for
28:35 - apache
28:37 - to get to where wordpress is let me know
28:41 - i cannot remember
28:44 - i'm just not in this file structure
28:46 - often enough
28:52 - all right let's check out what we have
28:54 - here
29:10 - jacob says www
29:14 - yeah that's what i'm looking for the www
29:16 - but i just can't
29:18 - there that's it yeah i couldn't remember
29:20 - what the the top one was
29:23 - or var how do you pronounce that there
29:25 - or far
29:27 - i don't know
29:28 - there we go but thank you jacob
29:32 - all right so we get
29:37 - there we go
29:41 - there's my wp config should be there
29:44 - there we go all right i'm gonna pull
29:45 - this off my screen for a second so i
29:47 - don't reveal
29:48 - all my secrets to the world
29:51 - uh and then that's what i'm gonna use
29:55 - to put stuff in
29:59 - that end file so all i'm just going to
30:01 - run this with nano so i can't show you
30:03 - on the screen but i'm just going to say
30:05 - i'm running the command nano
30:07 - which is a built-in text editor and it's
30:10 - probably the easiest one to use
30:12 - and that's really all i need right now
30:14 - and i'm going to do nano and open the wp
30:18 - config
30:23 - dot php file
30:26 - wonderful
30:28 - so now i'm gonna scroll down a bit
30:32 - to get the values that i need
30:43 - okay now don't show anyone your wp
30:46 - config file
30:55 - so if you're ever going through this
30:59 - you definitely don't
31:01 - don't want to show people
31:23 - okay so i have all the database info in
31:26 - there right now
31:29 - so we'll see
31:31 - if this works
31:32 - hopefully it does
31:39 - and now that i have that in there
31:42 - let's go back here
31:45 - and
31:53 - terminal
31:57 - all right so we have our terminal
31:59 - running
32:00 - down here the bottom which is very nice
32:03 - built-in feature here
32:07 - and
32:11 - i guess
32:15 - let's see how i run this
32:23 - all right so
32:26 - this didn't come with a readme file for
32:28 - what to run this what's what's the
32:30 - command to run this docker file
32:39 - i wonder if i could just run now
32:41 - let's just do that let's run now
32:51 - please enter the values for the
32:53 - following environment variables oh no
32:56 - it wants me to enter values for them
33:01 - why can't it just pull it from this dot
33:04 - m-file
33:13 - okay
33:19 - let me
33:35 - all right i'm gonna stop that here and
33:37 - then
33:39 - what happened to my terminal
33:44 - oh i put it over here all right let me
33:46 - run this in my terminal
33:53 - i can put in this stuff
34:20 - uh okay
34:22 - we need the send grid api key so it
34:25 - wouldn't let me proceed without the api
34:27 - key all right let's set that up and i
34:30 - can show this on the screen all the way
34:32 - up until i actually get the api key so
34:35 - let's go into send grid
34:39 - i didn't really think i'd have to get a
34:41 - send grid for this stream
34:45 - oops you know what i bet my timer yeah
34:47 - my timer's almost up so in about a
34:50 - minute i'm gonna stop and answer some
34:51 - questions so if you have any questions
34:53 - put them in the live chat now
35:03 - i used to log into cengrid all the time
35:05 - and i have not logged in for quite a
35:07 - while
35:28 - all right
35:32 - api keys
35:39 - okay cool
35:41 - um so what i'm going to do is create
35:43 - another api key
35:47 - oops
35:48 - i'm gonna do that after i break so i'm
35:50 - gonna take a short five minute break and
35:52 - i'm gonna go to the chat
35:55 - and
35:56 - answer some questions i'm just go all
35:57 - the way up to the top and just go down
35:59 - in chronological order try to answer as
36:01 - much as i can then when i come back then
36:04 - we're gonna set up
36:05 - uh api keys so that we can
36:09 - hopefully get this wordpress
36:13 - running on now
36:23 - i see a lot more of you were saying
36:24 - hello i'm not going to go through
36:26 - everybody but just hey everyone
36:32 - phoenix says i just wanted to inform you
36:34 - that i might be off the streams for a
36:35 - few days i have my master's exams due
36:37 - next month
36:38 - hey no problem uh good luck with your
36:41 - your exams i hope you do well and after
36:43 - you're all finished come back on and let
36:45 - us know how you did
37:04 - i don't know if you can hear my stomach
37:05 - growling if you can i apologize
37:08 - uh i need to eat
37:22 - okay so i as had that question a while
37:24 - back i i noticed that how can i learn
37:26 - coding i'm a beginner uh
37:29 - looks like
37:30 - uh
37:31 - arnaldo says uh go to free code camp
37:37 - yeah definitely free code camp's a great
37:38 - way to start i mean it does depend on
37:40 - exactly what you want
37:42 - but if you're not sure what you want to
37:44 - do
37:45 - i definitely recommend going to
37:47 - freecodecamp.org and just starting out
37:49 - you know go through some of their stuff
37:51 - definitely at least get to the point
37:53 - where you're starting to learn
37:54 - javascript you know get through the html
37:56 - and css stuff
37:58 - um
37:59 - you know try to stick with it through
38:01 - you know through that to the javascript
38:03 - algorithms and things and maybe try
38:05 - making some of the projects that should
38:07 - give you a good idea of how you like
38:09 - coding and
38:11 - you know
38:13 - i think it's a good way to start out
38:14 - there's a lot of other places you could
38:15 - start out with but
38:18 - i i think that's a pretty solid
38:20 - foundation
38:36 - uh
38:37 - shoe pump says what about react projects
38:40 - yeah we're still working on a react
38:42 - project this is just the uh the piece of
38:45 - the project where we're storing the data
38:48 - and managing the data so
38:50 - we're gonna set this up
38:52 - and then we'll be going back to the
38:53 - react stuff soon i was actually working
38:55 - on that the react stuff all day
38:58 - trying to get more more routes set up
39:00 - and pull in the data correctly
39:16 - nikki says the optional chaining
39:18 - proposal now in stage one possibly
39:21 - coming in javascript will be awesome for
39:23 - the router file on the project
39:25 - that's cool our router's getting huge
39:28 - anything to help out with that would be
39:30 - great
39:53 - says you're a genius jesse thank you i
39:55 - appreciate that i'm not exactly sure i'm
39:58 - a genius but
39:59 - if you say so
40:01 - uh i'm not gonna argue
40:16 - oh nikki s what hotkey i removed the
40:18 - indentation with i just highlighted
40:20 - everything and i pressed uh shift tab
40:24 - so just backwards tabbed everything
40:36 - i've got a questions where can i learn
40:38 - wordpress theme construction
40:40 - um
40:42 - i believe the wordpress documentation
40:44 - actually has a step-by-step process of
40:47 - learning theme construction so i would
40:48 - check that out that's probably going to
40:51 - be where you'll have the most up-to-date
40:53 - and official
40:54 - instructions on how to do it
40:56 - uh so so just check out the wordpress
40:59 - docs on that
41:00 - i haven't attempted to construct a
41:02 - wordpress theme for years
41:04 - so i'm not
41:06 - i know where i'd go if i wanted to
41:09 - to do it and that's the official
41:11 - documentation
41:12 - uh but
41:14 - i'm i'm just not in practice
41:18 - to be able to just go in and start doing
41:20 - it myself
41:56 - nikki says there's a folder called magic
41:59 - is there really a folder called magic in
42:01 - there
42:16 - i did not see that
42:30 - i don't know if i see it again then
42:32 - maybe i'll i'll try all right my timer's
42:35 - out so if i didn't get to your question
42:37 - right now i will get to it uh after the
42:39 - next break so i'm gonna start up this
42:41 - next pomodoro session
42:43 - [Music]
42:54 - excluding billing
42:55 - [Music]
42:56 - yeah that's fine
42:59 - api key name um
43:12 - hopefully this doesn't expose my api key
43:14 - right away
43:16 - it did
43:18 - we cannot show it to you again
43:20 - dang it
43:24 - all right let's try this again off
43:26 - screen
44:14 - all right so i'm gonna save this stuff
44:17 - in my
44:18 - last pass
44:58 - okay
45:04 - all right now
45:05 - [Music]
45:07 - let me see
45:08 - if i can
45:13 - if i can get this running
45:59 - you
46:14 - all right so i'm just making sure i copy
46:16 - all these keys properly
46:50 - hey
47:08 - all right
47:14 - that's weird it did not work
47:33 - i'm scrolling through the chat quickly
47:35 - to see if
47:37 - anyone
47:38 - noticed anything i was doing
47:41 - wrong
48:04 - okay i don't see anything
48:20 - let's
48:37 - okay
48:51 - all right i'm going to try this one more
48:53 - time just in case i
48:56 - you know pasted something in here wrong
49:01 - and if that doesn't work then we'll
49:05 - maybe try to look up
49:08 - and get some help on this
49:50 - okay
50:11 - okay
50:12 - got farther than i did last time
50:34 - all right it's going
50:37 - it's doing a lot of stuff in the
50:40 - terminal
50:44 - no errors so far
50:48 - i guess we'll just see
50:50 - what's gonna happen
50:52 - all right it's downloading and unzipping
50:55 - different things uh wordpress files i
50:58 - can see
51:02 - okay
51:03 - cool
51:24 - all right yeah let me i'll i'll put my
51:26 - terminal back over here
51:28 - if i accidentally show some type of
51:33 - info that i shouldn't then
51:36 - i guess i can always just change it
51:43 - all right so while that's going i'll
51:44 - just i'll check in to see some of what's
51:46 - going on in the chat
51:57 - okay
52:05 - oh andrew uh
52:07 - landed uh his first dev job
52:10 - congratulations that's awesome
52:14 - whoa
52:17 - all right that's cool so
52:21 - maybe that worked
52:30 - uh give me your name password
52:34 - information
52:36 - database
52:44 - okay well
52:48 - it was cool that we got it to run
52:51 - evidently i messed up something with the
52:53 - database
53:02 - let's make sure
53:03 - [Music]
53:09 - i hope i didn't
53:11 - actually mess up the database itself
53:14 - so i'm going to double check here
53:29 - nand says git versus svn i've never used
53:32 - svn so
53:34 - i'm gonna go with get
53:36 - but
53:37 - i'm not
53:38 - i can't really make a good comparison
53:42 - jacob asks if sendgrid is free
53:45 - um yeah so they have a free tier
53:48 - that works for a lot of a lot of things
53:52 - um so definitely check out the free tier
53:56 - and that may be all you need for your
53:58 - whatever project you're working on
54:13 - all right let me try to get in somewhere
54:15 - that
54:16 - will pull from the database
54:22 - i know this will work i've been working
54:23 - on this page for a while okay
54:26 - cool so the database is not broken it's
54:28 - just the way i tried to bring it into
54:30 - that project that's
54:32 - that's broken
54:45 - all right i'm gonna check how much time
54:47 - i have and then we'll see what we can do
54:49 - here
54:52 - okay
55:12 - all right what if we
55:20 - let's check this out
55:47 - let's check this out
55:52 - so we're going to check out google
55:54 - cloud my sequel
56:28 - let's just do this
56:29 - we'll just try to go through quickly
56:32 - and do this
56:38 - all right so i'm gonna pull these
56:40 - instructions over onto my other screen
57:01 - nikki just said
57:03 - thought he was going to google google
57:05 - for a second almost aged like 50 years
57:07 - in an instant
57:12 - all right so let's go to
57:18 - let's create a project
57:23 - and let's call this uh
57:26 - test
57:32 - test my sequel
57:34 - that looks good
57:35 - location
57:36 - organization
57:41 - can i just leave it with none yeah
57:48 - all right cool
57:51 - and
58:06 - need to enable billing this is my own
58:08 - account so i'm just going to do this on
58:10 - my own account just to get it working
58:22 - so should be billing area
58:34 - yep
58:46 - yep there we go
58:48 - okay
58:50 - how do i still have this link to my
58:52 - billing account
58:54 - i don't know i'm not getting charged for
58:55 - anything so i guess it's okay
58:58 - anyway
58:59 - all right so billing is linked up
59:07 - uh now let's
59:10 - enable
59:12 - this api
59:18 - oops
59:21 - api
59:22 - [Music]
59:25 - uh so this is the google cloud platform
59:28 - um admin panel let me make it a bit
59:30 - bigger sorry about that i just realized
59:32 - it was probably really small
59:37 - um
59:42 - oops
59:43 - i thought i clicked on the api
59:50 - i need to
59:51 - enable
59:52 - an api
59:58 - there we go so let's enable
60:07 - and
60:08 - i guess i'm looking for the
60:14 - actually let me search
60:19 - google cloud sql
60:22 - api
60:33 - enable
60:53 - all right cool
60:57 - and
61:01 - let's make sure
61:06 - let me pull this
61:08 - over make sure i enable this for
61:12 - a specific project
61:27 - ah i was
61:28 - dang it
61:30 - i accidentally enabled it for
61:35 - the wrong project let me disable that
61:37 - for this project
61:50 - alright
61:51 - let me get on the right project here
61:57 - there we go
62:01 - now double check to make sure it is
62:04 - enabled
62:08 - all right it is enabled awesome
62:14 - let's go to our cloud sql instances page
62:31 - you know what i'm going to paste the
62:32 - quick start into the live chat as well
62:35 - and then that way
62:42 - um
62:44 - you all can follow along if you'd like i
62:47 - definitely want to go with my sequel
62:52 - and
62:53 - sure let's choose second generation it
62:56 - look better
62:58 - all right choice is permanent for
63:01 - instance id
63:18 - sq
63:22 - instance
63:24 - root password oops
63:28 - generate and not show me
63:30 - no
63:32 - i want everybody to know let me i'm
63:33 - going to generate a different password
63:35 - uh with lastpass
63:52 - there we go
63:55 - and
63:56 - i'm going to paste this
64:10 - location
64:13 - central
64:15 - yeah that's fine
64:21 - let's check out these options probably
64:23 - just leave it all
64:27 - by default
64:34 - we're going to create this instance
64:59 - all right cool so that is doing its
65:02 - thing
65:03 - and the next step
65:07 - is
65:08 - we're going to get access to a console
65:16 - then we'll be able to create the
65:18 - database
65:19 - and actually
65:30 - see if we can migrate our database
65:59 - i'm just gonna
66:01 - while this does its thing i'm gonna
66:03 - search to see if there's a really easy
66:05 - way
66:08 - to migrate
66:16 - and it looks like there is some
66:17 - documentation on how to migrate
66:21 - application database
66:59 - so i'm gonna have to dump the database
67:14 - okay
67:18 - all right nikki says the stream is
67:20 - cutting out
67:23 - oh no maybe
67:28 - maybe i'm trying to do too much
67:36 - it's possible i have too much stuff
67:38 - running
67:44 - oh and my timer is up
67:48 - all right so we gotta wait for this to
67:51 - to be finished anyway
67:53 - so
67:55 - now i guess it's a good time for a break
67:58 - so let me go back to the chat
68:01 - let's see what
68:06 - what kind of questions y'all have
68:28 - okay
68:31 - andrew says uh do companies give you
68:34 - computers to develop on
68:36 - um yeah my my company does uh the laptop
68:39 - i'm using right now is my own but in my
68:41 - office uh at work i have an imac
68:47 - so
68:48 - i think it's pretty common for a company
68:51 - to supply you with a computer
69:01 - nan says uh jesse any words on
69:04 - tensorflow.js
69:06 - i have not worked with tensorflow.js
69:08 - it's it's
69:11 - i would love to work with tensorflow and
69:13 - all the stuff like that i just haven't
69:15 - had a time yet
69:16 - uh so i have some ideas on how i could
69:19 - use it but i i really can't give any
69:22 - comment on it yet because i i haven't
69:25 - had time to use it
69:28 - if anybody else has used it i'd love to
69:30 - hear your opinion on it
69:35 - uh world's asked what is sendgrid used
69:37 - for
69:38 - uh it's
69:39 - it's like an email
69:41 - uh client so you can
69:45 - if you need your app to send emails
69:50 - then instead of like writing the code to
69:52 - send emails yourself you can just use
69:55 - send grids api
69:57 - send the data to sendgrid
70:00 - and then it will handle all the email
70:02 - stuff for you
70:04 - um so we've used it on some previous
70:06 - projects and it's
70:08 - it's pretty um
70:12 - pretty easy to use
70:14 - hey it works cool
70:21 - uh new world says how good should i be
70:24 - at vanello javascript before learning a
70:26 - framework like view
70:30 - um new world says like dom manipulation
70:33 - i mean realistically i i
70:35 - i have not used vue but i think it's
70:38 - somewhat similar to react and you don't
70:40 - do a lot of direct daw manipulation and
70:42 - react so if you is like that don't worry
70:45 - so much about dawn manipulation
70:49 - um
70:51 - and to be honest with you i
70:52 - you know if you know just the very
70:54 - basics of javascript you can jump into a
70:57 - framework uh or library and that should
70:59 - be fine
71:01 - uh you know just make sure you keep
71:03 - learning javascript while you're doing
71:05 - it
71:06 - i
71:07 - sometimes people talk about like
71:09 - mastering job vanello jobs here before
71:11 - they move on but
71:14 - i mean i don't
71:16 - i think
71:17 - that's
71:19 - if you had all the time in the world and
71:21 - all the money in the world and you
71:23 - didn't have to worry about actually
71:24 - producing work
71:26 - for clients or for your
71:28 - you know your employer then yeah maybe
71:31 - you could do it like that but
71:32 - realistically
71:34 - like frameworks and libraries are there
71:37 - so that you don't have to do all the
71:39 - underlying stuff
71:40 - you can just make awesome things
71:44 - and
71:45 - have that layer of abstraction that it
71:47 - makes it easier for you to do
71:49 - not only that but
71:51 - you know if you rely on a framework or a
71:53 - library to do a lot of things for you
71:56 - and a lot of other people use that then
71:58 - it's well tested
72:00 - the bugs are all out if you try to build
72:02 - everything from scratch yourself with
72:04 - vanilla javascript odds are there's
72:06 - going to be a lot of cases where it
72:08 - doesn't work and you were not even going
72:10 - to know about it at first
72:12 - and you may never know about it you know
72:14 - it may affect some users and you never
72:16 - even hear from them
72:18 - so
72:20 - i i think as soon as you know enough to
72:23 - start to understand the basics of a
72:25 - framework it's fine to just jump into
72:27 - that framework you will continue to
72:29 - learn javascript as you use that
72:31 - framework as long as the framework isn't
72:33 - like such an abstraction that you don't
72:36 - use any javascript like react isn't like
72:39 - that i don't think view is like that
72:41 - you'll continue to use a lot of basic
72:44 - javascript stuff
72:46 - as you do that
72:47 - uh you know as you use your your library
72:56 - is is not a fan of the free code camp
73:00 - lessons so it's asking for something
73:02 - else um
73:04 - it says i am 17
73:07 - i read in class 10th tell me
73:10 - um yeah if you if you're not a fan of
73:13 - the free code camp stuff i mean maybe if
73:15 - you prefer like just reading try out the
73:18 - you don't know js series that's
73:20 - available for free online also eloquent
73:24 - javascript is available for free
73:26 - udacity has some nice intro courses that
73:29 - are also free and it's a mix of video
73:32 - and exercises and projects
73:35 - uh so a little bit different from free
73:37 - code camp
73:39 - uh
73:40 - you know i would try those out
73:43 - see how you like those
73:58 - okay
74:05 - all right the timer went up again so
74:07 - let's let's just try one more time to
74:09 - get this running now with our new
74:12 - database and so what we need to do then
74:16 - is
74:17 - pull the stuff from our current database
74:19 - and then
74:22 - import it into
74:27 - our
74:31 - our database
74:35 - let's see
74:44 - let me
74:49 - i can't
74:50 - i can't find my terminal where did it go
74:52 - oh it's over here
74:53 - all right if we're still here
74:57 - let's try this
74:58 - enter password
75:01 - all right let me pull this off
75:03 - to the side while i enter this password
75:05 - it may not even show up in the terminal
75:07 - but
75:08 - rather be safe about this
75:37 - all right let's copy that password and
75:42 - paste it
75:49 - um
76:09 - all right awesome
76:10 - so let me go back over here and let's
76:13 - see
76:14 - um
76:23 - cool we have this backup file now
76:26 - this backup dot uh sql
76:29 - all right so we have a backup of our
76:32 - database
76:35 - and
76:40 - now
76:41 - we need to import the database
77:01 - okay
77:02 - uh let me go in now and i'm gonna log in
77:06 - to that
77:09 - mysql database
77:13 - is it not letting why are you not
77:14 - letting me copy and paste
77:19 - no
77:20 - there we go
77:22 - so let's grab that and
77:27 - let's get in here
77:28 - and go
77:35 - you can connect to the remote
77:42 - uh ssh
77:45 - [Music]
77:46 - i'm assuming i'm rude
78:04 - what's he doing come on
78:15 - hmm
78:34 - okay
78:44 - maybe i skipped a step
78:46 - did i skip the step
78:50 - yep i did
78:54 - i forgot a step
78:56 - all right
79:12 - all right let's find the
79:15 - cloud shell icon there we go
79:20 - okay so this is gonna be yeah just like
79:22 - a terminal
79:33 - there we go
79:47 - alright so let's try to get in here and
80:15 - all right let's see
80:16 - like
80:18 - [Music]
80:23 - [Music]
80:26 - and
80:33 - connection name
80:36 - maybe i need to use that i'm not exactly
80:38 - sure what name i need to use for this so
80:40 - let's try this
80:43 - user
80:44 - [Music]
80:49 - [Music]
80:51 - okay so that's obviously not the right
80:53 - name
80:54 - so let's try a different name
81:04 - uh maybe
81:06 - we can try vip address
81:20 - nope
81:26 - all right let's see test my sequel
81:28 - instance let's try that
81:34 - here maybe
81:36 - no i didn't want it to do it again
81:39 - all right
81:40 - let me go over here well that's going
81:43 - again just to check the chat
81:52 - um
81:54 - oh yeah there's definitely
81:56 - uh
81:57 - someone is asking about if this could be
81:59 - posted later it will definitely yeah
82:01 - don't worry about it if it's 3 a.m you
82:03 - know by all means go to sleep
82:05 - uh this will be available the recording
82:07 - will be available online so uh here on
82:10 - the freecodecamp youtube channel
82:13 - so
82:14 - yeah definitely um
82:19 - definitely do that
82:22 - oh that was cool it actually filled out
82:24 - what i needed
82:26 - whitelisting your ip for incoming
82:28 - connection for five minutes excellent
83:09 - all right enter root password
83:11 - okay
83:17 - yes
83:19 - all right so i am in
83:22 - and
83:26 - back up
83:29 - all right i did that
83:32 - i'm follow along with some instructions
83:34 - here so
83:35 - that's why it sounds like i'm talking
83:36 - myself
84:05 - okay cool so let's do a few things here
84:08 - to set this up so that we can migrate
84:10 - this so we're gonna go
84:16 - we're going to create this database
84:20 - we're going to call it wordpress and
84:22 - we're going to end that with a semicolon
84:26 - okay
84:27 - and then we're going to
84:39 - grant all privileges on wordpress
84:48 - to
84:51 - admin
85:05 - um
85:12 - we can you can use any username you want
85:14 - for that we're just going to do admin
85:16 - buy
85:17 - and we'll go
85:20 - password custom password if you wish
85:26 - all right uh
85:28 - password isn't the best password
85:32 - um but since this is just a test and i'm
85:34 - gonna shut this down right after
85:38 - uh then this is okay
85:42 - all right wonderful now we're going to
85:44 - disconnect
85:55 - hopefully
85:58 - uh let's make sure i did that right
86:11 - i forgot
86:13 - that
86:15 - i have an error dang it
86:18 - yep
86:21 - writing um sql commands in terminal
86:26 - is always rough especially because of
86:28 - the um semicolons at the end so that was
86:31 - my problem now i'm gonna exit
86:34 - okay you can tell i'm not used to
86:38 - sequel terminal commands i've done it
86:39 - before but not often
86:42 - okay now for this next part here's what
86:44 - we're gonna do
86:47 - i'm gonna run my sequel you
86:50 - admin
86:51 - p
86:52 - and then we're going to put the ip
86:54 - address
87:00 - of the database basics
87:08 - his name is
87:20 - oops
87:22 - so
87:23 - i think i skipped a step
87:30 - all right let me go back here and
87:32 - authorize
87:35 - actually i don't think i need this
87:36 - anymore
87:38 - let me close this out for now i can
87:41 - always come back in if i need to i need
87:42 - to authorize um
87:48 - this other database so
87:52 - authorized network we need to add a
87:54 - network
87:55 - and
87:57 - we need to put the ip address of
88:01 - our
88:07 - our test
88:10 - or our wordpress database
88:13 - so the one we want to bring the data in
88:14 - from
88:17 - all right wonderful
88:24 - now
88:27 - in that
88:33 - where's my terminal there we go so now
88:36 - back here
88:39 - just make sure we're still in here great
88:41 - now we're going to do
88:46 - my sequel
88:48 - u
88:49 - admin
88:52 - p
88:54 - h uh we need the ip address of our
89:00 - my sql instance
89:03 - so let's grab that
89:06 - and
89:07 - put that in here so what we're going to
89:09 - do is is
89:11 - pull that data that we made that backup
89:14 - that backup sql here we're going to push
89:15 - that over into our
89:18 - our
89:19 - new google cloud sql database
89:23 - let's get that ip address
89:25 - and
89:26 - we're going to send that over to
89:27 - wordpress
89:28 - right because that's the name of the
89:30 - database that we just created that's
89:32 - pretty much empty oops wrong way
89:35 - and we're going to grab that backup
89:38 - dot
89:40 - sql file
89:41 - and
89:42 - we should need a password and
89:49 - the password for that user was
89:52 - password
89:53 - so i think that should work
89:57 - not sure how long this is going to take
90:00 - so i'll
90:01 - read some from the
90:09 - oh wait a second jeff says did you save
90:12 - that change no what did i not say
90:16 - did i not save with the authorization
90:21 - i hope i didn't save shoot
90:25 - uh is that which what it was
90:29 - yeah
90:31 - save it
90:42 - i'll probably get rejected
90:45 - i might have to just run that command
90:47 - again
90:55 - shoot
90:57 - it's kind of an important step huh
91:04 - did it work
91:07 - done
91:09 - save there we go
91:15 - good catch on that one i totally didn't
91:17 - even see it
91:18 - so
91:20 - i'll probably just as soon as it saves
91:21 - i'll just cancel that command and then
91:24 - re-run it
91:29 - because this is gonna allow uh
91:31 - permission
91:32 - uh for stuff to come from this ip
91:35 - address and make changes here
91:38 - all right so let's
91:39 - stop that ctrl c and run this again
91:48 - hopefully we'll get something this time
91:53 - and
92:11 - it see
92:38 - try to see the logs see what's happening
92:43 - all right so i'm not sure if anything
92:45 - happened or not
92:47 - uh but let's check it out
93:14 - hmm
93:35 - interesting
93:42 - all right
93:54 - all right i just want to try to verify
93:55 - that
93:57 - this did something
94:31 - all right i mean we definitely had a
94:33 - spike in storage
94:36 - right about the time when i ran that
94:38 - command
94:39 - so
94:41 - that's probably a good sign
94:48 - all right
94:49 - uh jeff says run the my sequel uh
94:52 - command line interface on the target see
94:54 - if you got anything there
94:56 - oh yeah that's definitely a great idea
95:15 - let's see
95:18 - i'm just going to do that because it'll
95:19 - just automatically uh put in the command
95:21 - for me that i need
95:28 - alright
96:10 - all right connection is
96:15 - oops let me copy this password
96:36 - all right let's see
96:47 - if it saved any of my previous commands
96:49 - there you go
97:01 - all right what sql command is just going
97:02 - to let me see
97:04 - what's in this wordpress database really
97:06 - quick
97:08 - if anyone knows please put it in the
97:09 - live chat otherwise i'm just gonna
97:14 - uh look it up oh jeff's saying use
97:17 - wordpress okay
97:44 - show tables
97:50 - thank you
97:51 - yes
97:54 - all right cool
97:57 - really cool okay so now
98:03 - let me change
98:25 - all right let me run
98:30 - let's grab this
98:34 - and i'm going to try running now again
98:38 - and i'm going to put in
98:40 - the new info for the new database
98:47 - uh
98:48 - both of you who help me out i very much
98:50 - appreciate the help
98:52 - um
98:56 - that definitely saved me minutes of of
98:58 - looking up this stuff all right cool so
99:03 - i can't remember if it made me
99:13 - i can't remember if it made me put in
99:15 - the um
99:19 - all the password stuff and it actually
99:21 - displayed it so i'm gonna do this off
99:23 - screen
99:30 - all i'm doing off screen is it's just
99:32 - asking me for the database host name
99:34 - password and stuff like that i'm just
99:36 - copying pasting values so
99:39 - yeah and it is actually showing the
99:41 - value so
100:00 - some good
100:15 - all right
100:18 - it's it's running it's building i'll
100:20 - throw this back over here now y'all can
100:22 - see some of this stuff
100:25 - um
100:27 - yeah so i'm gonna go back to live chat
100:29 - answer some questions while this does
100:31 - its thing
100:32 - basically um
100:36 - if
100:40 - i'm going to run this once if it works
100:42 - wonderful if it doesn't work then i'll
100:44 - have to try again later because uh we've
100:47 - been streaming for a long time
100:49 - i need to eat
100:51 - believe it or not streaming actually
100:53 - takes a lot out of you wow that was so
100:56 - fast
101:00 - let's try it out
101:09 - no error between unit password and your
101:12 - wp config.php file
101:15 - it's incorrect or we can't contact the
101:17 - database
101:29 - yeah it should be
101:31 - these should all be pulling in the right
101:33 - stuff
101:41 - hmm
101:48 - all right something's still happening
101:52 - i'm not sure
101:56 - i thought i had the right stuff
102:04 - hmm
102:18 - oh you know what
102:20 - i may have made just a very simple error
102:24 - i'm gonna go i'm gonna run this again
102:26 - since it went so quickly
102:29 - and
102:31 - i'm gonna try again
102:44 - and if this doesn't work then i'm really
102:47 - done this time
103:16 - okay
103:17 - bring this over
103:20 - i imagine there's probably a lot
103:24 - in the live chat that i need to catch up
103:26 - on
103:28 - before we end
103:31 - so let me try to find where i left off
103:33 - at
103:45 - all right let's try this out
103:56 - uh air it again
103:58 - all right
104:00 - so what i'll probably need to do at this
104:02 - point is uh see if anybody else has
104:05 - tried to do this and has had similar
104:08 - problems
104:10 - double check and make sure all my
104:13 - my passwords and stuff are
104:16 - [Music]
104:17 - sure make sure they're all correct
104:21 - and
104:23 - let's try to figure it out but uh at
104:26 - least for me i learned some uh good
104:28 - stuff today uh that i'm happy i did so i
104:30 - learned how to go through the process on
104:32 - google cloud
104:34 - to set up
104:36 - this
104:37 - sql database which
104:39 - was actually
104:40 - really easy
104:44 - i learned how to copy everything over
104:47 - uh which was also pretty easy
104:50 - so
104:52 - i i think it was definitely worthwhile
104:54 - uh we we set up a service in cengrid
105:00 - yeah so
105:02 - i don't know pretty cool i'll definitely
105:04 - have to do the
105:06 - the setup of the server again you know
105:09 - in the google cloud if that's what i end
105:11 - up going with
105:13 - uh because obviously i'm not gonna
105:14 - personally pay for this
105:16 - since it's for my employer
105:19 - um but
105:21 - yeah a little disappointed we didn't get
105:23 - it working completely but uh we we ended
105:26 - up actually setting up
105:28 - more than i expected because i didn't
105:30 - think we'd have to do this whole
105:31 - database thing so
105:34 - anyway i hope you all learned something
105:36 - uh as well
105:39 - and i'm gonna get through these last few
105:41 - questions here and uh then i'm gonna
105:44 - call it a day for this this stream
106:14 - yeah
106:15 - nikki says google recursion do it do it
106:18 - now just for fun all right let's google
106:20 - recursion
106:28 - i love it it says do you mean recursion
106:32 - so
106:33 - i mean if you get it you get it
106:36 - otherwise look up recursion
106:50 - all right so looks like there's it's a
106:51 - the live chat's actually a lot of you
106:53 - all talking to each other and helping
106:54 - each other out which is awesome i love
106:56 - when that happens so thank you
106:59 - good deal yeah
107:00 - what are you doing baby
107:02 - [Music]
