00:00 - hey everyone and welcome back to css3 in
00:03 - 30 days or code 30 things in 30 days
00:05 - with css3 whatever you want to call it
00:07 - uh today we're going to be playing with
00:09 - the
00:10 - css
00:11 - clip path
00:13 - property
00:14 - which allows us to make custom shapes uh
00:19 - from an image so we'll put an html image
00:21 - in our markup and then you can clip a
00:23 - path around a shape to create circles
00:27 - polygons triangles custom shapes it's
00:30 - pretty cool and plus i'm going to show
00:31 - you a neat online free tool that lets
00:34 - you kind of draw your own shape and then
00:36 - copy the css i mean that's cool so head
00:39 - over here into my screen and this is
00:41 - what we're going to be doing here so day
00:43 - three as clipping images the course
00:45 - files as usual in every module there's
00:47 - going to be a dedicated lesson there
00:49 - that's going to allow you to download
00:51 - the course files for each day so today
00:53 - is three clipping images you're gonna
00:54 - get index final and sandbox.css
00:59 - of course the sandbox is where we're
01:00 - going to add our css
01:02 - and final is where you can reference the
01:04 - final css for your own reference and for
01:07 - help and the index is just a markup
01:09 - that's already pre-coded you're always
01:11 - welcome to play around with it and do
01:12 - whatever you want with it but here's
01:13 - what we're gonna do so over here in my
01:15 - browser
01:16 - day three clipping images with shapes
01:18 - we're gonna use css3 to clip the
01:20 - following images with different shapes
01:21 - so i just have different images stock
01:23 - images that i pulled from unsplash that
01:26 - are just four random images
01:29 - at 300 by 300 pixels now here is the
01:31 - final result the first one is a circle
01:35 - second one is a cool chat
01:37 - bubble
01:38 - the third one is an x and number four is
01:40 - a right pointing arrow and the cool
01:42 - thing here is these are actual
01:44 - images that they're kind of masked now
01:46 - they're not necessarily masked because
01:48 - that's a separate thing but clipped
01:50 - images is the property that we're going
01:52 - to be using and so if i just drag on
01:54 - this image it's actually the original
01:55 - square image
01:56 - but it's clipped with this
01:59 - this circle and this one is the chap the
02:02 - chat bubble
02:04 - and this is the x
02:06 - right facing arrow so it's using
02:09 - exclusively css to get this effect we
02:11 - don't have to use photoshop so this is
02:12 - pretty cool and it's actually quite easy
02:15 - to to do and understand so let's head
02:18 - over into our code editor and into
02:22 - sandbox.css
02:23 - now the first thing we want to do is we
02:25 - want to select this first image example
02:28 - number
02:29 - one so that image the class is we have
02:32 - it set up here it's simply clip image
02:35 - one
02:36 - clip image one
02:39 - and all we need to do is use a simple
02:42 - property called clip dash path
02:45 - and then we're going to add the values
02:46 - but i also want to be just a little bit
02:48 - more
02:49 - safe here and do the prefix
02:51 - for webkit
02:53 - so let's start with webkit clip path and
02:55 - then we'll work our way down so we're
02:57 - going to start with just a circle so
02:58 - here's the value that you add circle and
03:01 - then parentheses and in there it's going
03:04 - to accept some values so for a circle
03:07 - this is what we write and then let's
03:08 - play around with it so you can see how
03:10 - it works so fifty percent at fifty
03:12 - percent fifty percent save that now if i
03:15 - go over here to the browser you can see
03:16 - it made the circle where we did it now
03:18 - what happens when we change those values
03:20 - what do these mean so if i were to go
03:22 - like over here in the code editor ten
03:24 - percent
03:26 - at fifty percent fifty percent that
03:28 - image
03:29 - that clip is much smaller
03:32 - so technically the smaller that first
03:34 - value the smaller the size of the clip
03:37 - for the circle what if i were to do 100
03:40 - in the code editor here let's see what
03:42 - happens nothing
03:44 - so perhaps that size is just too large
03:46 - and 50 is the maximum so if i were to do
03:49 - like 60
03:50 - perhaps you wouldn't even see it so that
03:53 - 60 is still being grabbed around the
03:55 - corner so you can you know kind of
03:57 - create this weird effect but 50
04:00 - effectively
04:01 - is going to make it all the way around
04:04 - within the
04:05 - constraints of the square image now you
04:08 - can play around with that to see what
04:09 - different effects you can get now at 50
04:11 - and 50 let's see what happens when i
04:13 - change this first value to 10 and 50.
04:16 - head back to the browser here
04:18 - you can see this is the offset kind of
04:20 - the the offset of where the circle clip
04:23 - is going to be positioned so 10
04:26 - it looks like it's about 10
04:29 - to the left so maybe what if i were to
04:30 - do zero let's just see what that does it
04:33 - goes straight down the center
04:35 - of the
04:36 - circle now if i were to do zero percent
04:38 - on the other value it pushes that up so
04:41 - it's going to the center so this is
04:42 - coming from the center
04:44 - is what i'm gathering from experimenting
04:46 - with this so 0 and 0 is the center axis
04:50 - of the circle
04:53 - and it's positioned at the top left so
04:55 - it's taking the circle
04:56 - here's the circle here we go
05:00 - and it's going from the center and if i
05:02 - were to go zero zero it's going up into
05:04 - the top
05:05 - left
05:06 - for you maybe it's up here of that
05:08 - square so the zero and zero axes of the
05:10 - square
05:12 - is going it's going up here so we're
05:13 - only seeing a quadrant of the circle now
05:16 - if you play around with that some more
05:17 - you can see the different results that
05:19 - you get you can position that circle
05:21 - but 50 and 50 is what gets you that
05:25 - circle clipped perfectly over that image
05:27 - so that is the first one right there
05:30 - now i'm going to add clip path as well
05:33 - to be
05:35 - browser compliant circle fifty percent
05:38 - at fifty percent fifty percent
05:41 - save that now let me show you a cool
05:44 - trick
05:45 - if you head to your browser and go to
05:47 - bennett feely dot com slash clippy
05:51 - he has this really awesome css clip path
05:53 - maker that lets you create clip paths
05:57 - and there's demos and there's examples
05:59 - and you just copy the css down here
06:01 - what's cool about this is one if you
06:02 - just wanted to quickly create a shape
06:04 - without trying to figure it out yourself
06:06 - you could do it here by using the
06:08 - presets like triangles parallelograms
06:11 - rhombus and so on or
06:13 - you can custom polygon and create your
06:16 - own so let me just let's just play
06:17 - around with a couple here and and do
06:19 - that so i'm going to show you up here in
06:21 - our final example number two is this
06:25 - chat message box
06:27 - so let's go down to clip path maker
06:31 - and find that message box because i got
06:33 - it from here so down here message if i
06:36 - click on this
06:37 - it gives me the clip path down here that
06:40 - i could just copy paste onto the next
06:42 - clip path uh
06:44 - image that we have in our in our css and
06:46 - then we'd be done with it but
06:48 - let's just see how it's how it is uh
06:51 - made so you can see here
06:53 - it has all these corners and this is how
06:55 - it's
06:56 - creating the
06:58 - shape
06:59 - of the
07:01 - of the actual message box maybe let's
07:03 - choose a more simple one just so you can
07:04 - get the idea here triangle there's only
07:07 - three values and we can see it down here
07:10 - fifty percent and zero what happens if i
07:12 - drag this first
07:14 - value over to the far left top left zero
07:18 - and zero what's the value it's zero and
07:20 - zero even if i just moved it a little
07:22 - bit
07:23 - one percent and zero so clearly this top
07:26 - one this top value
07:28 - is the x axis
07:31 - so i'm
07:32 - 31 over 63 over 100 over so that's how
07:36 - you position that first item that first
07:39 - point on the clip
07:41 - and then if i were to go down
07:43 - you can see the y-axis changes so that's
07:46 - how that first point works and you can
07:48 - see here point number two
07:51 - was this one
07:53 - if i drag it anywhere you could see zero
07:55 - and zero is top left
07:57 - 150 and 0 is top right oh sorry 100 and
08:00 - 0. i looked at that wrong and anywhere
08:02 - else in the container you can see the
08:05 - values change so the triangle we're
08:07 - going down to the bottom left
08:10 - at 100
08:11 - so zero on the x axis one hundred
08:13 - percent on the y axis and then over here
08:15 - we have one hundred and one hundred
08:17 - because we're at the far bottom right
08:19 - which is one hundred percent
08:21 - down in the
08:23 - uh over in the x-axis one hundred
08:24 - percent down on the y-axis so you get a
08:26 - triangle
08:28 - and so now if i go back to the message
08:30 - i get a number of different values and
08:32 - you can just easily see where they're
08:34 - positioned and how that works
08:36 - so that's pretty cool so let's copy that
08:38 - and see what happens i'm going to copy
08:40 - that css go back to our sandbox
08:44 - and i'm going to select clip dash path
08:47 - dash 2 and just
08:50 - paste
08:50 - those values now save it and let's see
08:53 - what happens oh sorry clip clip image
08:55 - clip image two there we go now go to
08:57 - your browser there we go now you can see
08:59 - here in our first example we use circle
09:01 - and in our second example we used
09:03 - polygon circle has a different set of
09:05 - values so as we played around with just
09:08 - a couple minutes ago and polygon goes
09:10 - based on however many numeric values you
09:12 - have you have x and y separated by comma
09:15 - and the more separated by comma values
09:17 - you have the more points in your your
09:20 - polygon you have and you can create
09:21 - totally custom shapes so let's call that
09:23 - clip image number two and we copied and
09:25 - pasted it there let's go around and play
09:27 - with
09:29 - this next one example number three so
09:32 - this is an x so let's go to
09:35 - clip image don't make that mistake again
09:37 - three
09:38 - and let's start out with our clip path
09:41 - clip dash path
09:43 - and it's a polygon so we're gonna do
09:45 - polygon
09:46 - and this is how i like to do it uh to
09:48 - write them up it's just a little bit
09:49 - easier to read so polygon in the
09:51 - parentheses semicolon and then
09:54 - write your first value i'm going to hit
09:56 - a
09:57 - return and then tab myself in a little
09:58 - bit here just easier to read this so i'm
10:01 - going to start
10:02 - with 20 percent over
10:04 - and
10:05 - 0 on the
10:07 - y axis so a little bit over not down
10:11 - comma
10:13 - return let's go 0 percent
10:16 - and the next value will be 20
10:19 - now if i were to stop there
10:21 - let's see what happens let's see what
10:22 - that looks like it might be kind of
10:24 - weird or you might not even see anything
10:26 - so you don't see anything yet so let's
10:28 - add a little bit more and see what we
10:30 - can come up with the next one is thirty
10:32 - percent and fifty percent now i'm not
10:35 - just pulling these numbers out of my
10:36 - butt here that this was
10:38 - uh practiced and played around with
10:40 - before using the clip path maker and
10:42 - everything like that so so
10:45 - to create something from scratch you'd
10:46 - have to kind of map it out or use the
10:48 - clip path maker but i want to show you
10:50 - how it works in practice so let's add
10:52 - another couple values here and see what
10:54 - we
10:54 - create
10:56 - next we're going to go 0 on the x
10:58 - and 80 on the y now let's stop there and
11:01 - let's see if anything's been created yet
11:03 - so nothing yet
11:06 - uh it's possible that maybe i'm typing
11:08 - something incorrectly
11:10 - okay so the issue here why i don't see
11:12 - it is because uh the clip path property
11:14 - isn't rendering properly in my
11:16 - browser my atom built-in browser so
11:19 - that's why we must be using the webkit
11:21 - clip path prefix
11:24 - at least for me i need to use that so
11:25 - i'm going to be using that to start with
11:27 - so webkit clip path with our values
11:29 - let's see what we've got so far there we
11:31 - go so you can see it's creating value
11:34 - one
11:34 - two three four there we go so cool let's
11:38 - keep going so now the next one's gonna
11:39 - be 20
11:40 - and 100 percent
11:42 - the next one will be 50 on the x
11:45 - 70 on the y
11:47 - 80 on the x as the next set of values
11:51 - and
11:52 - 100
11:53 - on the y
11:55 - save that let's see what we're coming up
11:57 - with see it's taking shape
11:59 - you can see that it's actually starting
12:00 - to take shape so here in the values
12:02 - we've got 20 and 0 0 and 20
12:05 - 30 and 50
12:08 - 0 and 80. 20 and 100
12:12 - 50 and 70
12:14 - 80 and 100 so we just have a few more to
12:17 - create the rest of this shape so let's
12:20 - go back to our code editor
12:22 - uh we got 100
12:24 - and then 80.
12:25 - and then we got 70 and 50
12:29 - 100
12:30 - and 20
12:32 - save it check it out again i just like
12:33 - seeing this progress so you got you can
12:35 - see we just have a little bit more to do
12:37 - we just have to
12:39 - a few more points back to our code
12:40 - editor
12:41 - we got 80
12:43 - and 20
12:44 - and then we have 50 and 30
12:47 - so you can see these kind of start to
12:49 - mirror
12:50 - mirror things a little bit so 20 and 100
12:52 - we have 120
12:54 - 0 and 80 80 oh a little bit different so
12:56 - some of these values are inversed some
12:58 - of them aren't so save that it should be
13:00 - our x let's go back over to
13:02 - example number three no not quite so i
13:04 - did mess something up here so go back to
13:06 - the code editor uh yes right here so
13:08 - it's 80 and zero percent
13:12 - and then 50 and 30. go back over here
13:15 - there we go so i was right initially in
13:18 - my code editor so it's you can see how
13:19 - these are actually mirrored so 50 30 80
13:22 - 00 120
13:24 - we've got zero let me see so 30 50 0 80
13:28 - 28 100 so these are kind of mirrored
13:32 - opposites so that is the webkit clip
13:34 - path copy that paste it below and change
13:37 - the property simply to clip path
13:39 - as the fallback that'll do the trick
13:41 - save that and there's your click path
13:43 - image three now finally the last one we
13:45 - have is the
13:47 - right facing arrow now feel free to try
13:50 - creating it yourself
13:52 - or you can go to the clip path maker and
13:55 - draw your own version or you know if you
13:57 - really wanted to you could just click
13:58 - the right arrow it'll give you the
14:00 - values
14:01 - like this and you can copy and paste it
14:03 - or you can play around with this drag it
14:05 - around you know create a custom shape
14:08 - like so
14:10 - you know i just created this like funky
14:12 - looking arrow
14:14 - something like that something a little
14:16 - bit funky
14:18 - copy that head back over to your sandbox
14:21 - and i'm going to say
14:22 - clip image 4
14:25 - paste that in there save
14:27 - check it out in the final result and we
14:29 - got my cool custom weird looking arrow
14:32 - there now what you can also do is head
14:34 - over to the clip clip path maker and
14:36 - click on custom polygon
14:38 - and then just click to add some points
14:42 - you know i'm just going to go like this
14:45 - and then you can click on the in the
14:46 - check box in the top left here on your
14:48 - first point and drag them around
14:51 - to create a totally custom
14:54 - polygon shape that you can use
14:57 - in your
14:58 - there we go i kind of have like this
14:59 - hourglass sideways stanley cup you know
15:02 - and then there's your values
15:04 - and then feel free to just try coding
15:06 - them out yourself so those are the four
15:08 - examples we got our circle then
15:10 - different sets of polygons heavily using
15:12 - the bennett feely clippy path maker
15:14 - which is really cool thanks benefili
15:16 - check it check his site out follow him
15:18 - on twitter do all the things
15:19 - um
15:20 - because he's made a really great tool
15:22 - that makes our lives easier as web
15:23 - designers and web developers and those
15:25 - are your examples feel free to play
15:27 - around with them make custom shapes and
15:29 - use them in your own projects thanks for
15:31 - watching day three clipping images with
15:34 - shapes in css3 in 30 days cheers
