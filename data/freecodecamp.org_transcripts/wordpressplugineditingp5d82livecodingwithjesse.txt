00:04 - hey everybody
00:05 - welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:07 - jesse
00:08 - and today we're going to do something
00:10 - weird we're going to code in php
00:14 - nothing wrong with php it's just weird
00:16 - because we usually don't code with php
00:19 - uh we roll with javascript around here
00:22 - but um
00:24 - i have to i don't really have another
00:26 - option
00:27 - so let me
00:28 - kind of break down what the problem is
00:30 - and how i think we're going to solve it
00:32 - and if any of you have
00:35 - better ideas please let me know i'm open
00:37 - to trying anything at this point
00:40 - because
00:43 - i need to get some data it's really
00:44 - important and our current setup won't
00:47 - allow for getting the data that
00:50 - uh that we need
00:52 - so
00:54 - here's here's what's happening i've made
00:56 - these custom fields so if you're not
00:58 - familiar with wordpress this might not
01:00 - make sense at first but then hopefully
01:02 - once we get into it it'll make a little
01:04 - bit more sense but
01:05 - uh on the the posts
01:08 - we made all these custom post types
01:10 - right and we have these posts well i've
01:12 - added in some custom fields right by
01:15 - default wordpress has certain fields
01:17 - like a title and content things like
01:19 - that
01:20 - well i needed more than that
01:22 - all right you'll see why when we look at
01:25 - a specific case
01:28 - but i can't access that data through
01:30 - graphql so we're using that wp graphql
01:34 - plugin and it doesn't give us data from
01:36 - those custom fields by default
01:39 - so to complicate a little bit more i've
01:42 - used a plug-in called advanced custom
01:44 - fields pro
01:46 - to get that data
01:48 - or i'm sorry to make those fields
01:52 - so what i need to do is figure out a way
01:56 - in php
01:57 - so most likely in we either add to the
02:00 - php plug-in that we've been using to
02:03 - make all the custom post types or we'll
02:05 - have have a new one i haven't really
02:07 - decided yet
02:09 - um
02:11 - we need to figure out some way to make
02:13 - those
02:15 - the data from those fields
02:17 - available
02:20 - in graphql
02:22 - through that wp graphql plugin
02:25 - so i have some ideas
02:26 - so i went to the git repository
02:31 - and
02:35 - there were some other people that were
02:36 - trying to do the same thing so i have
02:38 - some ideas based on what they posted of
02:40 - their solutions
02:42 - and hopefully from their solutions we'll
02:44 - be able to piece something together
02:46 - that'll work for our use case
02:49 - that's the plan
02:50 - if anybody has any skills with wordpress
02:52 - php
02:54 - um
02:55 - you know wordpress plugins
02:58 - uh then you're most welcome here and uh
03:02 - you know feel free to chime in
03:06 - uh at any point
03:08 - all right so i just got a message from
03:10 - one of my student workers and
03:14 - he does not have the level of access
03:16 - necessary to do what i just asked him to
03:20 - do in wordpress so
03:21 - let me give him access real quick
03:24 - and then we'll get started
03:32 - if you notice my head like kind of
03:34 - blowing i'm listening to like
03:37 - 90s
03:38 - rap music right now on spotify so i just
03:41 - finished uh the second season of luke
03:44 - cage on netflix and so now i'm of course
03:47 - like
03:48 - remembering all this old school rap
03:50 - music because it's all the the
03:52 - soundtrack for that show is
03:54 - all that kind of stuff
03:56 - so
03:59 - apologies to that
04:02 - anybody else a fan of luke cage or the
04:04 - any of the marvel series on netflix
04:09 - i'm i'm a big fan luke h is one of my
04:11 - favorites
04:14 - i'd probably say luke cage and daredevil
04:16 - were my favorites out of all the
04:18 - marvel series
04:21 - okay
04:23 - all right so i gave him access
04:25 - let's see
04:35 - all right so i just made the student
04:37 - worker in admin hopefully
04:40 - hopefully he doesn't mess anything up he
04:43 - seems to catch on pretty quickly though
04:45 - to everything so i think it'll be good
05:01 - all right so i just messaged them and
05:03 - said with great power comes great
05:04 - responsibility
05:08 - so see if anybody gets that reference
05:10 - let me know where it's from
05:13 - all right cool we're up to a decent
05:15 - viewer account now so i think now is a
05:16 - great time for me to get my face off the
05:18 - screen
05:20 - and switch over
05:22 - all right cool so let me check let me
05:24 - show you what's what's going on here
05:26 - so
05:27 - this is uh
05:30 - what is this graph
05:32 - graphical i think that's how we
05:33 - pronounce it graphical uh it's a chrome
05:36 - browser plugin that lets us
05:40 - search through
05:42 - our graphql data
05:44 - so i've just searched for menu so this
05:46 - is the custom post type that i made and
05:49 - that i'm using these custom fields with
05:52 - and you can see
05:54 - here's what's available
05:59 - these are all the fields that are
06:00 - available for me to get data from
06:02 - there's a lot of stuff there
06:04 - actually i'm probably blocking some of
06:05 - it it doesn't matter because the stuff
06:07 - we want is not it's not there
06:09 - right and if you have this this
06:11 - extension you can check out
06:14 - what we have in graphql as well if you'd
06:16 - like
06:19 - but yeah i can't get access to that so
06:22 - we need to change that
06:25 - so let me show you
06:27 - let me log in here and i'm going to show
06:29 - you
06:30 - what this post
06:31 - looks like
06:34 - and
06:36 - menu
06:38 - there we go menus
06:42 - let's see
06:43 - maybe this one all right cool so we have
06:45 - this would be
06:46 - a
06:48 - navigation menu
06:50 - that would kind of show up on the right
06:52 - hand side and just scroll with the user
06:55 - and this navigation menu
06:57 - would include these links and it would
06:59 - appear on all pages that have to do with
07:02 - franciscan
07:03 - press
07:05 - or franciscan university press i think
07:08 - we should just call it franciscan press
07:10 - though because otherwise it gets
07:11 - shortened to fu press
07:13 - and that's not really a good a good name
07:16 - right
07:17 - um
07:19 - let me get all right christopher's
07:21 - asking for the link i'll put that in the
07:25 - in the description yeah that's my fault
07:26 - i should have just put it in anyway
07:29 - uh oops
07:32 - all right the link
07:33 - to the graphql endpoint that i'm working
07:35 - with is now in the live chat
07:39 - so you can check that out if you want
07:41 - and i'm gonna throw in the link to the
07:44 - dead version of the website
07:46 - dev to franciscan dot university
07:52 - so you can check that out as well
07:56 - that should not take that long
07:59 - i thought i set it up to always keep at
08:01 - least one instance running
08:05 - i have to work on that if anybody uses
08:08 - now
08:09 - uh from zeit
08:11 - and you know why this could be taking so
08:14 - long let me know
08:16 - because i'm not it shouldn't take that
08:18 - long
08:19 - um
08:20 - okay
08:23 - so let's just go to a place that should
08:26 - have this menu so let's let's check out
08:29 - um
08:31 - franciscan
08:34 - the press thing let's see
08:36 - maybe franciscan magazine should have
08:41 - i don't even have that route set up yet
08:43 - okay
08:44 - um
08:45 - i still have to set that one up some of
08:47 - the stuff down lower on the menu i guess
08:49 - didn't get set up
08:52 - um
08:53 - households
08:59 - oh there we go
09:01 - that's kind of odd
09:03 - why isn't that working
09:11 - all right cool well good to see that i
09:13 - still have work to do anyway this
09:15 - households page i know should have a
09:17 - menu
09:18 - so
09:20 - we're gonna the menu would just be on
09:23 - this side right where i'm not kind of
09:24 - moving my mouse
09:25 - uh and it would just scroll down with
09:27 - the user so i just wanna just let you
09:29 - know where this menu would be and then
09:30 - on mobile i think the menu will drop to
09:32 - the bottom so we'll actually make two
09:34 - different menus and we'll just switch
09:35 - out visibility based on screen width and
09:38 - we can do that just with some some media
09:40 - queries with css
09:44 - all right
09:45 - and i forgot to set my pomodoro timer
09:47 - let me set that now
09:49 - so i'm going to code for 25 minutes and
09:52 - after that i'm going to go to the live
09:53 - chat and answer your questions so i see
09:55 - some some activity there in the chat
09:57 - so
10:00 - if
10:03 - if you've asked something i'm not
10:04 - ignoring you i'm just going to wait
10:06 - until after this 25 minute period is up
10:12 - all right
10:14 - so we probably won't even need to look
10:16 - at this page anymore we're mainly going
10:18 - to be dealing with this page and with
10:20 - our our php
10:22 - so let's scroll over
10:26 - there we go
10:27 - so here's our
10:29 - our current plugin the fastest way to
10:31 - get started i think would just be to use
10:34 - this same plugin that we've been using
10:36 - for all our custom post types this
10:38 - plugin is available on github
10:40 - if you check out that
10:43 - fus marcon repository that's the same
10:46 - place we have the repository for
10:49 - uh for this this react project you'll
10:52 - see this franciscan franciscan custom
10:54 - post types uh plug-in so you can check
10:57 - that out if you'd like
10:59 - it's open source feel free to change it
11:01 - edit it use it for whatever you need to
11:05 - um
11:06 - but i think we could we could probably
11:08 - just for now put some stuff down here
11:13 - and then
11:15 - probably put it in its own plug-in at
11:17 - some point because this plug-in is
11:18 - getting really really huge
11:24 - all right
11:53 - all right sorry about that my student
11:55 - workers keeps asking me things on slack
11:57 - so
11:58 - i want to respond
12:00 - um
12:02 - all right so next thing i'm going to do
12:03 - is pull over this
12:07 - these
12:11 - i guess examples that are here
12:13 - in this
12:15 - repo and i'm going to paste this in the
12:18 - description so
12:19 - these are attempts that other people
12:21 - have made
12:24 - to get this to work basically to solve
12:25 - the same problem that we're we're having
12:28 - and it seems like at least some of them
12:30 - were successful okay so this one
12:33 - was successful
12:35 - in particular for the repeater field
12:38 - which is the field that we're we're
12:39 - using
12:41 - so i'm i definitely want to try this one
12:43 - first there's a bit
12:46 - there's one that's that's
12:48 - shorter
12:49 - it doesn't quite require as many lines
12:51 - of code
12:52 - that we might be able to utilize later
12:54 - on when we have some more custom fields
12:56 - that aren't as complex as this
13:00 - but for now i really want to try to get
13:01 - this repeater field working because i
13:03 - know if i can get this working i can
13:05 - probably get anything working this is
13:07 - seems to be
13:11 - the most
13:12 - complex
13:14 - example that we could use
13:17 - all right so
13:18 - first things first let's just copy and
13:20 - paste this and start editing it and see
13:22 - if we can get
13:24 - a different response here
13:27 - and with php and wordpress plugins in
13:29 - particular you know pretty much right
13:32 - away if it doesn't work because usually
13:34 - everything crashes
13:36 - so
13:37 - that'll be
13:38 - it'll be obvious if we mess it up
13:41 - and then also
13:43 - if we don't see the right data here
13:46 - then
13:47 - we'll know right away
13:56 - okay
14:00 - all right that always seems like i'm
14:02 - looking away from the camera but my my
14:04 - other monitor is is over here so
14:08 - i don't i was going to move the webcam
14:10 - to show you but i
14:12 - i don't want to move it and then i give
14:13 - everybody motion sickness so i'm going
14:15 - to hold off on that
14:16 - but my other monitors here that's how i
14:18 - keep looking away
14:21 - all right so i'm going to read through
14:23 - this anybody that's better at php than i
14:26 - am which
14:27 - wouldn't be that hard to be better than
14:28 - me at php uh please
14:31 - correct me if i'm reading this wrong but
14:33 - i'm just gonna try to think through this
14:36 - so i can get some idea of what's going
14:38 - on before we jump in and start changing
14:40 - things
14:43 - okay
14:45 - so
14:46 - we're adding an action graphql exhibit
14:49 - fields and
14:50 - a lot of these functions are built into
14:52 - wordpress so
14:55 - we we just kind of have to assume like
14:57 - this is going to work this function does
14:59 - something
15:00 - if we really are confused we can look it
15:02 - up and probably will be able to find it
15:05 - in the wordpress documentation
15:08 - all right so we're going to add an
15:09 - action graph gives you fields function
15:12 - fields okay
15:16 - making an object okay so it looks like
15:18 - in this case
15:24 - session
15:26 - okay so session is the name of a field
15:30 - all right good so
15:31 - let's
15:34 - let's change session right now
15:38 - oh sessions type all right
15:40 - um
15:44 - sessions
15:48 - field
15:52 - yeah let's change every instance of
15:55 - session
15:57 - to link
15:58 - since that's what we're dealing with in
16:00 - this particular case so
16:03 - we'll just get get that uh
16:06 - change right away
16:08 - um
16:21 - why did i have
16:24 - for some reason it's putting two s's
16:26 - there but
16:27 - all right lynx thanks and then i need to
16:29 - capitalize it here
16:32 - and
16:37 - i can't remember if that was supposed to
16:38 - be capitalized or not let's let's
16:39 - capitalize
16:41 - okay
16:50 - oh john you caught that about too many
16:52 - s's there thank you
16:54 - um
16:56 - all right so now let's let's continue so
17:02 - we're creating this new object type
17:04 - we've given it a name of link a
17:06 - description
17:07 - um
17:08 - one link row and then your text domain
17:13 - i i mean this seems like an example
17:15 - example text that
17:18 - but i'm not sure what's supposed to go
17:19 - in there so i'm going to leave it like
17:21 - that for now and hopefully we'll be able
17:23 - to see this
17:24 - displayed somewhere later on and then
17:27 - we'll get an idea of what it should be
17:30 - all right so then we have fields so in
17:32 - this case the fields that are being
17:34 - defined for each row so i'm making a lot
17:37 - of assumptions here but i'm assuming
17:39 - that each one of these
17:44 - is is going to be one row of our of our
17:48 - repeater so each row in our repeater
17:51 - fields is
17:52 - is made up of two fields
17:54 - and in this case
17:56 - they have the uid in the name but in our
17:58 - case it's going to be
18:01 - link
18:02 - well let's say
18:05 - link
18:09 - url
18:11 - and let's call this
18:17 - link name i'm pretty sure that's what i
18:19 - named them
18:21 - and in both cases these are strings
18:28 - so we don't have to change that
18:37 - resolve a custom post type and make sure
18:39 - this is exposed to graphql
18:46 - white map space
18:48 - let me check that
18:50 - example here where did it go
18:55 - i don't know what that white map space
18:57 - is
19:01 - okay in this app i'm reading right here
19:03 - the context of this
19:05 - there we go white map space sessions
19:07 - have some string fields and a field for
19:09 - a map space
19:12 - the white map space custom post type
19:17 - okay
19:22 - in this app you have exhibits
19:25 - okay so the main custom post type is
19:28 - white exhibit custom post type which can
19:30 - have a list of sessions that's the
19:32 - repeater field so in our case
19:35 - white exhibit
19:37 - is menu
19:39 - now i'm not sure
19:42 - i have some fields
19:44 - sessions have some string fields and a
19:46 - field for a map space white map space
19:49 - custom post type so i don't know that we
19:52 - need that white
19:53 - white map space
19:54 - all right i think
19:56 - this would be a field
20:02 - maybe that is connecting us to another
20:05 - post type which we don't really need
20:07 - right now on that one but it's good to
20:08 - know that we can do that so let's get
20:10 - rid of map space
20:18 - okay
20:23 - all right so we've gotten rid of that
20:25 - just it's always nice to get rid of code
20:27 - especially when you don't really
20:28 - understand it anyway
20:30 - one less thing to worry about
20:33 - all right define the field containing
20:35 - your repeater
20:45 - links
20:47 - return a list because repeaters are
20:49 - lists
20:50 - okay
20:52 - type
20:53 - links type description
20:55 - yeah
21:06 - all right um
21:13 - all right this is graphql exhibit fields
21:17 - this is this needs to change right um
21:22 - unless this is just
21:24 - this name could be whatever we want
21:27 - i guess it doesn't matter but let's
21:29 - let's say menu
21:32 - menus fields
21:41 - let's say that
21:43 - the thing that i'm i'm
21:46 - i don't get is
21:51 - these values should in some way be
21:53 - connected to that menu's custom post
21:55 - type
21:58 - and i'm not seeing where that connection
21:59 - is
22:01 - so
22:04 - let me check this again
22:15 - all right i'm going to scroll up and see
22:18 - because there's a similar solution
22:21 - and i said each year on our project
22:23 - that'll return strange
22:34 - get filled
22:45 - using issues gives you so good first
22:48 - meadow did we use get field
23:14 - okay and you see some previous examples
23:16 - with the same problem
23:18 - which
23:19 - the these were
23:21 - i believe failed attempts
23:31 - well it looks like there's a gist here
23:33 - with another solution
23:36 - we'll take one look at this
23:38 - whoa
23:53 - okay so this section looks very similar
24:12 - but this section is definitely different
24:16 - hooray
24:25 - interesting
24:48 - um
25:05 - all right let me see
25:10 - it says to use this get field but i
25:13 - didn't see it in here so let's search
25:15 - for it
25:17 - there we go there it is
25:18 - get field links
25:20 - post
25:22 - okay you know what i'm just going to try
25:23 - this so i can't really see
25:27 - exactly how this is gonna all link up
25:29 - but
25:30 - i'm gonna try it
25:33 - maybe i'm just missing something and it
25:35 - it will work i hope that's the case all
25:37 - right so i just copied that
25:40 - and i'm going to paste it
25:43 - oops
25:46 - too many things open
25:48 - all right
25:49 - so we're going to go down
25:52 - to plugins
25:54 - this is the wordpress admin panel in
25:56 - case you know you're not familiar with
25:58 - that
25:59 - um
26:01 - so i'm gonna go down to plugins
26:04 - if i can find it there we go and then
26:06 - editor
26:07 - you can actually edit the code for
26:09 - plugins right here it is not recommended
26:12 - obviously
26:13 - right i would be way more hesitant to do
26:16 - this to a site that was live but we're
26:17 - still in development mode so
26:19 - the site has not launched yet and i'm
26:21 - okay with this
26:24 - you could definitely crash a live site
26:26 - when doing this
26:28 - and
26:29 - let's update and hopefully we don't get
26:32 - a white screen
26:34 - hey
26:36 - great
26:38 - i'm gonna refresh just to verify yeah no
26:41 - no weird right white screen that's
26:44 - awesome
26:45 - um now let's go back here and
26:48 - i'm just gonna run that
26:49 - and see
26:53 - i'm going to click on menu again and see
26:55 - if we can
27:08 - um
27:22 - all right i'm not getting it there but
27:24 - it potentially it might show up
27:27 - elsewhere
27:29 - so what did we call that
27:33 - link
27:35 - let's see if we can find it here
27:48 - um
28:06 - hmm
28:11 - i don't think that worked
28:14 - but we could try
28:17 - reloading everything
28:42 - hmm
28:50 - let me check my time
28:52 - all right so if you ask some questions
28:53 - in the chat just hang in there for about
28:55 - six more minutes and then i'll answer
28:56 - some questions
29:08 - all right this is alphabetical order so
29:15 - i'm just gonna scroll down
29:18 - nope nothing just link
29:21 - um
29:25 - yeah i'm not worried about that
29:39 - i mean i'm gonna i don't think link is
29:40 - the link we're looking for i'm gonna
29:42 - verify that now
29:43 - yeah that's definitely not the
29:45 - particular link that we are
29:49 - looking for that's the permalink
29:58 - all right let me check this out
30:16 - hmm
30:48 - hmm
30:50 - nope
30:51 - all right so i'm not seeing anything new
30:55 - uh in our
30:58 - our schema so
31:02 - first attempt didn't work
31:04 - not really surprised at that
31:11 - so
31:13 - let's see
31:22 - all right let's think about this
31:24 - uh description for graphql okay so all
31:26 - of this
31:30 - define your fields the description one
31:33 - link row
31:59 - define the field containing your
32:01 - repeater
32:06 - you know what we
32:08 - i'm wondering if this is case sensitive
32:11 - and that makes a difference
32:13 - right because we are
32:18 - i don't know if this would make a
32:19 - difference here then usually when we're
32:21 - talking about the description the name
32:23 - um can be what anything
32:31 - thank you equals give
32:34 - blanks
32:46 - you know what i should double check and
32:47 - see if i've
32:50 - what the slug for the repeater is that i
32:53 - actually uh used
32:58 - all right so let's go in here
33:05 - here's our plug in our custom fields
33:06 - plug-in
33:08 - so we're going to go check out
33:10 - every time you make a new field in this
33:12 - plug-in it's it's given a name but then
33:14 - it's also given a slug so the slug is
33:17 - the more
33:20 - useful thing uh when we're dealing with
33:22 - the code
33:25 - so let's check out links
33:28 - and
33:29 - this field name is links
33:32 - let's make sure that's how we did it yep
33:34 - so we did say links and not link
33:41 - so i think this is fine because
33:44 - are we talking about one link yeah
33:48 - um
33:48 - but here we have links
33:54 - okay
34:01 - hmm
34:06 - all right so that looks okay
34:15 - oliver says set graphql exhibit fields
34:18 - and not graphql menu fields
34:22 - okay oliver yeah so it was exhibit
34:25 - fields before but i thought exhibit i'll
34:28 - try it out
34:32 - um i'll try that out it just seemed like
34:36 - before that um exhibit was specific to
34:40 - the project like exhibit was that custom
34:43 - uh post type
34:44 - so
34:49 - i will try that out this would be the
34:51 - last thing i try before i answer some
34:52 - questions so
34:55 - go back here
34:56 - to this
34:58 - and
35:00 - i just pasted in the new stuff
35:06 - okay
35:08 - and now
35:11 - i'm gonna do a refresh just to make sure
35:14 - nothing's saved there
35:20 - all right
35:38 - nothing
35:47 - hmm
35:50 - okay
35:51 - all right couldn't get it to work yet
35:53 - let's take a five minute break answer
35:55 - some questions hopefully we can think of
35:57 - some other things to try uh for this
36:02 - i will say i assume that this problem
36:04 - was going to take me a while to figure
36:06 - out so like not something that i would
36:08 - get done during today's stream so
36:12 - as long as i'm making some progress
36:15 - which i think we've made some progress
36:16 - so far
36:17 - at least in figuring out what
36:20 - a little bit about what doesn't work
36:24 - so i think we'd be good progress is good
36:27 - okay
36:44 - all right looks like some of you said
36:46 - spider-man i was talking about uh marvel
36:49 - characters and i i mentioned earlier
36:51 - that i just finished watching season two
36:53 - of luke cage and i really liked it uh it
36:56 - looks like some of your spider-man fans
36:59 - i always liked spider-man uh when i was
37:02 - younger that was my favorite
37:05 - spider-man and wolverine were my
37:06 - favorite
37:08 - when i was younger
37:12 - i still like him
37:24 - all right looks like a lot of the stuff
37:25 - in the chat or discussion between some
37:27 - of the people in the chat so i'm
37:28 - skipping through some of it if i happen
37:30 - to miss your question
37:31 - uh because i got lost in the discussion
37:34 - just um ask me again down down below
37:46 - okay christopher thanks
37:48 - um that graphq uh graphical extension
37:51 - that i'm using on chrome is called uh
37:55 - chrome chromie ql c-h-r-o-m-e-i-q-l
38:00 - so that's supposed to be chromical i
38:02 - don't know what it's how you pronounce
38:03 - it but
38:04 - um
38:06 - let's see
38:12 - christopher said ooh php is gross
38:16 - well i guess everybody has their own
38:18 - preferences for the first language i
38:20 - will say this it seems like php does get
38:24 - hated on quite a bit these days
38:31 - christopher says no js all the way oh i
38:33 - mean i much prefer node but sometimes
38:35 - you got to do what you got to do
38:37 - um
38:38 - says i've never been a fan of wordpress
38:40 - either i prefer to implement the thing
38:41 - i'm trying to build either with a
38:43 - library or by writing my own version
38:44 - usually works better because i know how
38:46 - it works
38:47 - yeah for sure um
38:49 - in this case
38:51 - i i was not about to write a whole
38:53 - content management system uh on my own
38:56 - though
38:58 - just didn't have the time or the
38:59 - resources to do it
39:04 - and i mean wordpress is extremely stable
39:06 - and has a huge user base so there's no
39:09 - way i can replicate that
39:18 - clergson says apollo
39:20 - and graph
39:22 - graphic love react native
39:25 - i'm also a huge fan of react native i
39:27 - have a react native project going on on
39:28 - the side with balance.io
39:31 - so that that project is coming along
39:33 - really well i can't wait till we're done
39:34 - and i can actually tell you all like hey
39:36 - check it out in the app store
39:38 - um if any of you are at all interested
39:41 - in cryptocurrency i think that that's
39:43 - going to be a really cool app
39:44 - once we're finished with it
39:50 - all right automated sound kinetics says
39:53 - hi i'm new to this channel i'm 18 and
39:55 - i'm really interested in coding but i'm
39:57 - really confused about choosing a
39:58 - programming language to start with can
40:00 - anyone help me out
40:03 - yeah
40:05 - it definitely depends on what you want
40:06 - to do but if you have no idea what you
40:08 - want to do
40:09 - i recommend starting with javascript as
40:12 - your first programming language and
40:14 - here's here's why
40:18 - javascript knowing javascript will allow
40:20 - you to make
40:22 - the
40:23 - largest variety of things with
40:26 - javascript you can of course do websites
40:29 - web apps but you can also do
40:32 - native apps
40:33 - for both mobile and desktop using
40:36 - electron and react native
40:39 - you can even use javascript to do some
40:41 - machine learning
40:42 - um with like tensorflow.js or brain.js
40:46 - you can do
40:49 - ar vr
40:51 - xor whatever they're calling you know
40:53 - all the the augmented reality and
40:56 - different types of reality there's ways
40:58 - to do with javascript you can do
41:00 - internet of things stuff with javascript
41:02 - i think it's
41:04 - it's the javascript library like johnny
41:07 - five
41:08 - that lets you do
41:09 - like internet of things
41:11 - stuff i forget what exactly it's called
41:14 - but
41:15 - um
41:18 - there there's really to my knowledge no
41:20 - area of programming that you are totally
41:23 - locked out of in javascript but with
41:25 - other programming language you are a bit
41:27 - more limited
41:28 - right so
41:30 - not that it would be impossible to
41:32 - program a lot of other things in another
41:34 - language but it's it's definitely not as
41:36 - easy
41:38 - right javascript just runs in the
41:39 - browser
41:41 - so the barrier entry there is is just so
41:44 - low
41:46 - now if you know you want to go into a
41:48 - specific field
41:49 - like if you really wanted to do machine
41:51 - learning or data science i'd say go with
41:53 - python if you really really wanted to
41:55 - focus on
41:58 - mobile apps for either
42:00 - ios or android then maybe you want to
42:03 - specialize
42:04 - right so
42:06 - if there's a certain company you really
42:07 - want to work for and
42:09 - they specialize in one thing go with
42:12 - that although if you want to do anything
42:14 - that has to do with the internet with
42:16 - with websites
42:17 - you're gonna have to know some
42:18 - javascript at some point
42:20 - unless you i don't know completely back
42:23 - end and work in in some language some
42:26 - other language right but
42:28 - if you're all to touch the front end
42:31 - of any web app
42:33 - you're going to need to know some
42:34 - javascript
42:36 - so
42:37 - i'd say that's a good place to go in
42:39 - terms of
42:41 - giving you the best opportunity
42:43 - to explore and figure out what you like
42:47 - if you want to know what's like really
42:49 - easy to pick up
42:50 - honestly i think python's really easy
42:52 - because there's not a whole lot of weird
42:54 - syntax stuff going on with with
42:56 - different characters it's all based on
42:58 - indentation so python seems to be
43:01 - easy to pick up
43:03 - my eight-year-old is learning python
43:04 - right now so
43:06 - um i think it's way easier for him
43:10 - to use that because it's indentation
43:12 - based instead of trying to look for the
43:14 - weird characters and knowing when to
43:16 - press shift on the keyboard and
43:17 - everything so
43:20 - that's that's my opinion on that so
43:25 - i um i i don't pretend to be an expert
43:30 - but based on my experience and my
43:32 - knowledge of of the field right now
43:35 - that's what i would go with
43:39 - okay
43:41 - all right so i didn't get through all of
43:43 - the chat
43:44 - but i'm gonna restart this pomodoro
43:46 - timer and then hopefully get through the
43:48 - rest of the chat when we're done
43:50 - all right
43:54 - let's see
44:12 - all right so we left off
44:14 - with
44:18 - hmm
44:25 - we left off with a failure right we can
44:27 - need it to work and the last thing we
44:29 - tried was switching back to
44:31 - um exhibits instead of menus now the the
44:36 - thing that
44:40 - the thing that i thought was odd
44:45 - was that
44:46 - we made no reference
44:48 - to
44:49 - the post type
44:52 - where these fields were being stored
44:54 - uh or or that these were attached to
44:56 - right so that menu's post type is where
44:59 - we're
45:00 - we're entering the data
45:07 - so i'm wondering if let's go back to our
45:09 - examples here
45:13 - i'm i'm wondering if
45:16 - in this example here
45:22 - where basically this part
45:26 - matches up
45:28 - with this
45:33 - i'm wondering if all of this
45:37 - has to go with it as well
45:58 - let's see where
46:00 - i'm gonna copy and paste this just so i
46:02 - can use my editor shortcuts to to look
46:05 - through it and get some syntax
46:06 - highlighting on it um but maybe we'll
46:09 - find our answer down here so let's give
46:11 - it a lot of space so we know what's what
46:16 - there we go now it's so much easier just
46:18 - to to read this with the syntax
46:20 - highlighting
46:21 - all right so
46:24 - this is this repeater field
46:32 - so we're putting in a lot more info
46:34 - about the repeater field
46:42 - object type type okay
46:45 - and then when we get down here we see we
46:47 - have a different name here so this is in
46:50 - the stats fields graphql stats
46:54 - fields
46:56 - okay so we're we're naming this
47:02 - i i kind of think that this could change
47:05 - and it doesn't doesn't necessarily
47:07 - matter
47:09 - to get names that description all right
47:12 - so this this section like i eventually
47:15 - figured out is supposed to be like this
47:17 - singular
47:18 - um
47:20 - okay so what
47:22 - we've
47:22 - done
47:24 - what we've done when this section i
47:26 - think will work
47:28 - field stats
47:30 - type
47:32 - description
47:44 - all right and what is that compared to
47:54 - okay
47:59 - links
48:03 - fields
48:09 - all right so let's grab
48:11 - this
48:13 - right and
48:15 - actually i want to see where they where
48:17 - this goes we have this array here do we
48:20 - reference array anywhere down here
48:22 - though
48:32 - do we reference that particular array i
48:35 - don't think so
48:53 - okay
48:55 - um let's grab this
48:57 - and
49:00 - we'll add it up here modify it for what
49:03 - we need
49:05 - so instead of stats
49:09 - we're going to say
49:11 - links
49:25 - all right see links
49:26 - repeater field
49:28 - and here's this thing this key a field
49:32 - and then this
49:33 - i wonder
49:35 - i wonder if we'll need that and where we
49:37 - can get that from like if that value is
49:40 - assigned when we've created that
49:49 - let me you know i have a fan running in
49:51 - the background on low let me know if
49:53 - that noise is if you can hear that noise
49:55 - and if it's annoying um i'll try to
49:59 - turn that off if it's if it's getting
50:00 - too annoying for you all
50:06 - i'm going to double check my messages
50:08 - here make sure there's no work messages
50:15 - there's so many notifications
50:19 - all right i think i'm good
50:28 - okay
50:30 - that's
50:31 - that's the only thing that i'm worried
50:33 - about here is that key
50:36 - of like where are we getting that key
50:37 - from
50:43 - and then the subfields
50:48 - we definitely need to change
51:03 - hmm
51:12 - i'm wondering
51:29 - hmm
51:42 - i'm going to leave it as is what i'm
51:44 - wondering is
51:46 - would would this code actually register
51:51 - new custom fields
52:00 - but it's not it's not applying them
52:01 - anywhere
52:05 - all right let me get rid of this stuff
52:06 - down here though
52:10 - so i definitely don't want this in here
52:20 - and i'm gonna take one more look at this
52:23 - something at the bottom that i was
52:25 - interested in here
52:39 - okay
52:44 - all right so let's let's just throw this
52:46 - in here right now
52:48 - and see what happens i'm
52:51 - well i'm kind of surprised we didn't get
52:52 - an error already but
52:55 - we'll see maybe we'll get one here
53:00 - hey nikki's here hey how's it going
53:04 - yeah there we go the php code changes
53:06 - roll back because in airline 1703.
53:16 - an unexpected
53:20 - that's interesting
53:21 - right because we we got that you know we
53:23 - copied and pasted that right from here
53:25 - so
53:26 - okay
53:34 - well let's take that out i kind of
53:37 - think we'll get another error but
53:39 - yeah unexpected use
53:44 - all right so that code is not going to
53:46 - work
53:53 - all right well let's take some of this
53:54 - out then
54:13 - this
54:23 - all right
54:27 - let's update just get rid of those
54:29 - errors
54:31 - all right great
54:34 - um i don't want to
54:41 - back here
54:46 - let's go
54:50 - there's our menus
54:53 - i'm gonna go into the menus just to make
54:55 - sure we haven't messed anything up
54:58 - um
55:00 - this would be a good
55:02 - a good check to make sure that they're
55:05 - they're right please
55:08 - insurance
55:10 - whoa
55:11 - whoa whoa whoa
55:16 - all right that's definitely not the
55:17 - right url
55:24 - some the old site has some weird stuff
55:25 - like this so in this case i'm not gonna
55:28 - attempt to
55:29 - keep this url
55:34 - okay well it looks like it hasn't messed
55:36 - it up
55:50 - okay
55:54 - nikki
56:05 - all right
56:06 - can
56:07 - anybody hear me and see me at this point
56:12 - i think it's working now
56:15 - so um
56:16 - yeah so there's a huge thunderstorm
56:18 - right now
56:19 - and the power went out so i think i'm
56:21 - gonna end the stream i'm really sorry to
56:23 - end it so abruptly but i think i'm gonna
56:26 - end the stream because the odds of the
56:27 - power going back out are pretty good
56:30 - um so i don't i don't want to keep
56:32 - having um you know this this video once
56:35 - it's you know available again have these
56:37 - huge gaps in it
56:39 - uh so
56:40 - yeah so i'm just gonna end and this now
56:43 - try to keep working on it i'm maybe i'll
56:45 - switch to my laptop uh so that
56:48 - i don't have to deal with the power
56:49 - going out but um anyway thank you all
56:52 - for watching and for your help and
56:54 - advice during this i'm still gonna keep
56:56 - working on this so this is an important
56:59 - thing like this this really needs to get
57:01 - finished before we can launch
57:04 - um
57:06 - probably other than that i'm going to
57:07 - add some more custom post types and
57:09 - custom fields and have my you know my
57:12 - student workers fill that that data in
57:15 - and that'll basically be what i'm up to
