00:00 - a Lambda function is a small and
00:02 - Anonymous function used for performing
00:05 - quick operations it can take in multiple

00:10 - difference between a Lambda function and
00:12 - a regular function this is a regular
00:14 - function that Returns the addition of
00:17 - the arguments so right here we have a
00:19 - and b and it just returns a plus b if we
00:22 - were to do this in a Lambda function we
00:24 - will use the keyword Lambda then after
00:27 - that we will given the argument which is
00:29 - a B then we use a colum and we will
00:33 - specify the expression so we want to add
00:36 - those arguments together which is a plus
00:38 - b now you can run this directly by
00:40 - wrapping this around in a print function
00:43 - or you can store it in a variable like I
00:45 - did here called ad and then you can call
00:47 - this right here now if I run this you
00:50 - can see that we have five
