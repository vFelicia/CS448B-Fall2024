00:02 - hi in this video we are going to talk a
00:04 - little bit more about routers and how
00:06 - they relate to networking
00:08 - routers are the things that connect
00:11 - different small area networks uh i want
00:14 - to give kind of a metaphor for this so
00:16 - i'm a teacher i work at a school let's
00:17 - say i have a package that i need to get
00:19 - to somebody that works in the district
00:21 - offices i don't know where her office is
00:23 - exactly but i know her name
00:25 - i go to my secretary that would be this
00:27 - is me this is my secretary i go to my
00:30 - secretary i say hey i need to get this
00:32 - to so-and-so at the district office can
00:34 - you please help me out here she'll say
00:36 - oh sure i don't know exactly where her
00:37 - office is either but i know how to get
00:39 - there i know the next step so even
00:41 - though i didn't know the next step she
00:42 - does so she goes on and sends it on to
00:44 - the secretary of the district office now
00:46 - that district office secretary has no
00:48 - idea who i am or where i am but she
00:50 - knows the end location
00:52 - what i'm trying to get across here is
00:53 - each router only has to know its own
00:56 - little network only the stops right next
00:59 - to it it doesn't have to know the whole
01:01 - internet just has to know its own
01:02 - connections and it can take information
01:05 - and say all right i don't know exactly
01:07 - where that's going but i'll pass it on
01:08 - to the right direction
01:10 - and that's really all it takes routers
01:12 - can be different sizes different
01:14 - capacities but what they do is just know
01:16 - their own neighborhood take the
01:18 - information and pass it on in the right
01:20 - direction another really powerful thing
01:22 - that we're going to get into a little
01:23 - bit later is
01:24 - they don't have to have the full package
01:26 - of information either if this computer
01:28 - is trying to send information all the
01:30 - way up here it might get split up and go
01:32 - to two different routers and that's okay
01:34 - the computers are still going to know
01:36 - how to put that information back
01:37 - together
01:39 - now the little pieces of information
01:41 - that are sent are called packets packets
01:44 - are actually little pieces of binary
01:47 - code which i'm going to draw up here for
01:48 - you
01:50 - all right so this is an example of what
01:52 - a packet might look like it's just this
01:54 - line that goes up and then down and up
01:56 - and down and it's either up or it's down
01:59 - that is an electrical current so a
02:01 - computer gets that and can translate
02:03 - that into ones and zeros which we all
02:05 - know is binary code the way it does that
02:07 - is it draws lines a certain distance
02:09 - apart basically and if it's a pi it's a
02:11 - one if it's down low it's a zero as we
02:14 - discussed in previous videos this one
02:16 - and zero business can really mean a
02:18 - whole lot more in fact it means
02:20 - everything everything can be translated
02:22 - into ones and zeros so this is
02:24 - really powerful now
02:26 - these little packets are sent across
02:28 - through these routers
02:30 - and sometimes if there's a file that's
02:32 - too large for one packet it can be
02:34 - broken up into frames or smaller little
02:37 - packets these packets don't have to go
02:39 - the same route they go whichever routes
02:40 - available whichever is fastest and since
02:43 - they have the nip address encoded into
02:45 - them
02:46 - all the routers know where to send them
02:48 - when they get to the end destination
02:50 - that computer knows how to put it all
02:52 - together
