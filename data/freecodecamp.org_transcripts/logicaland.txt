00:02 - pause the video now to think on
00:06 - it and here's the

00:21 - true or false but really it returns a
00:25 - truthy or a falsey value in the case of
00:28 - logical and it returns one of two values
00:31 - the first falsy value it evaluates or
00:35 - the last truthy value it evaluates in
00:38 - our example today the first falsy value
00:40 - is null so the statement returns null to
00:43 - be printed to the log was this Behavior
