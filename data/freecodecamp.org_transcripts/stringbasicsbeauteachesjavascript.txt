00:00 - a string or string literal is a series
00:03 - of zero or more characters enclosed in
00:05 - single or double quotes
00:12 - there is the string of my name which is
00:15 - bow
00:16 - if you need a quote character in your
00:17 - string you can escape a quote from
00:20 - considering it as an end of a string
00:22 - quote by placing a backslash in front of
00:25 - the quote
00:26 - so here let me show you that
00:32 - so here i made a string
00:34 - and it's he said hi
00:36 - so if that's going to look like this he
00:39 - said hi
00:40 - when you put a backslash in front of the
00:42 - quote character the program knows that
00:44 - you're not trying to end the string
00:45 - you're just trying to use the quote
00:47 - character in the string
00:49 - string values in javascript may be
00:51 - written with single or double quotes so
00:54 - so long as you start and end with the
00:56 - same type of quote
00:57 - you don't have to escape a quote
00:58 - character as long as it is a different
01:00 - type of quote character than what is
01:02 - surrounding your string
01:03 - so what you could do you can make this
01:05 - sentence one again you can not escape
01:08 - these quote characters
01:10 - and you can put a single quote
01:12 - at the end and at the beginning
01:17 - okay
01:18 - there are also other characters you need
01:20 - to escape which means to put a backslash
01:22 - in front in order to use them as a
01:24 - string
01:25 - so they have backslash single quote
01:27 - that's how you do the single quote
01:28 - here's how you do the double quote
01:30 - whenever you want to backslash in a
01:31 - string you just do two backslashes the
01:34 - first backslash is the escape character
01:36 - you can also put in a new line a
01:38 - carriage return a tab a backspace and a
01:42 - form feed
01:44 - you can concatenate or put two strings
01:46 - together with the plus operator
01:52 - so here it's going to put two strings
01:54 - together it's going to look like this
01:58 - and it's basically just going to be one
01:59 - string that has my name beau carnes and
02:02 - watch out for spaces concatenation does
02:04 - not add spaces between concatenated
02:06 - strings so you have to add them yourself
02:09 - that's why i have the space after the
02:10 - word bow
02:12 - you can also concatenate strings and
02:14 - variables
02:18 - so that would just be my name is beau
02:22 - carnes this is who my name is and it's
02:24 - going to add the full name which is this
02:25 - variable up here another way to
02:27 - concatenate strings is use is using the
02:30 - plus equals operator like this
02:35 - so the plus equals operator means that
02:38 - you are going to start with this
02:40 - variable and then add this to the end of
02:43 - the variable it really means full name
02:46 - equals full name plus is my name
02:50 - so the full name variable is now going
02:53 - to be
02:55 - so that's what the full name variable is
02:57 - going to be now the final thing i want
02:58 - to tell you about strings is that in
03:00 - javascript string values are immutable
03:03 - which means they cannot be altered once
03:05 - created now you can assign a variable to
03:08 - a new string but you can't actually
03:10 - change the original string we have
03:12 - sentence twice
03:13 - you so you can assign sentence to a new
03:15 - string but you can't actually change the
03:18 - original string like arrays you can
03:20 - change an element in the array but you
03:22 - can't change a character in the string
03:24 - after you create it
03:25 - thanks for watching my name is beau
03:27 - carnes don't forget to subscribe and
03:29 - remember use your code for good
