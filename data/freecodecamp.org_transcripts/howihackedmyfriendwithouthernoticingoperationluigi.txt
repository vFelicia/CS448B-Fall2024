00:00 - um
00:01 - alex is going to introduce himself
00:02 - because he can do a much better job at
00:04 - it than i can so alex
00:07 - hi everybody
00:09 - hi hi
00:11 - hello
00:12 - um i will see you all in 150 slides so
00:16 - um can you see everything okay good my
00:17 - name is alex and some people let me do a
00:20 - talk here at pycon and so here i am um i
00:22 - used to do security instead of response
00:23 - atlassian but lately i've been doing uh
00:26 - red teaming which is like
00:28 - sponsored crimes and it's been really
00:30 - fun
00:31 - and today i'm going to talk to you about
00:32 - some things um also i also
00:35 - i've also agreed to like help organize
00:37 - this conference
00:38 - called purplecon and i've agreed to help
00:39 - organize it because i'm young and
00:41 - invincible
00:42 - uh recently no not recently a few years
00:44 - ago now um some uh i wrote about some
00:47 - like
00:48 - crimes that i did and
00:51 - some people some journalists wrote about
00:53 - that blog post and they said oh
00:54 - according to a blog post by a hacker who
00:56 - goes by the name alex
00:58 - and they put it in quotes and so alexis
01:00 - is my alex is my real name also and so
01:03 - so this is my this is my hacker name now
01:05 - um you can call me that i can't stop you
01:08 - i'm about to talk about i'm talking i'm
01:09 - about to talk about hacking my friend
01:11 - like a real friend like an actual friend
01:12 - of mine who's like a real person and not
01:14 - made up and so like in case any of you
01:17 - are having the genius idea that you
01:18 - should hack your friends um don't do
01:20 - that you it's not good it's not a good
01:23 - thing to do
01:25 - the only reason that's okay that i did
01:26 - it is because i explicitly asked them
01:28 - like d is it okay if i try and hack you
01:30 - do you understand what it means like are
01:32 - you sure you want to take the risks and
01:33 - so on and so on and this person said yes
01:35 - anyways this is my friend diana um
01:37 - dana's not her real name that's not a
01:38 - real picture this whole thing is like a
01:40 - lie um but it's what it's not a lie that
01:43 - she really did say it's okay for me to
01:44 - try and hack her and explain what all
01:45 - that is
01:47 - and so some things about her that you're
01:48 - gonna need to know is that she's a
01:49 - comedian that's her job and she's uh
01:52 - sweet and young and her like tech
01:54 - literacy is normal she like all of you
01:56 - people here at pycon probably know more
01:57 - about taking computers than she does she
02:00 - knows the normal amount for someone her
02:01 - age
02:02 - and so i like for some reason she said
02:04 - yes by the way she was like the first
02:05 - person i asked and i was like hey is it
02:07 - okay if i try and hack all your stuff
02:08 - and she was like yeah that was much
02:09 - easier than i thought it would be and so
02:11 - i made some rules about like okay well
02:13 - there's not just going to be no rules
02:14 - maybe so what what what constraints are
02:16 - we going to have and so i have 12 months
02:18 - to do it i can do any term in that 12
02:19 - months
02:20 - i'm not allowed to delete anything so
02:22 - i'll have to add stuff and look at stuff
02:23 - but
02:24 - i was like what if i deleted your emails
02:26 - and she was like oh that that would be
02:27 - bad okay you can't do that
02:29 - um and uh also i'm not allowed to
02:31 - disrupt her daily life so this means
02:32 - like if i were to lock her out of her
02:34 - email account by like changing the
02:36 - password then that would be bad because
02:38 - she needs her email account to like do
02:39 - things or if i was to like
02:41 - i don't know spam post stuff on her
02:42 - facebook wall then like that would be
02:44 - bad because she'd be like distracted by
02:46 - that i need to like not like interrupt
02:48 - her or inconvenience her because she's
02:49 - my real life real friend
02:51 - um also i decided that i'm just going to
02:53 - do this whole thing without getting
02:54 - caught because that's what not getting
02:56 - distracted sounds like anyway and also
02:58 - i'm not allowed to exploit the fact that
03:00 - i know her in real life so i know her
03:01 - like email address and phone number and
03:03 - where she lives and all this stuff i'm
03:05 - gonna not use that information i'm gonna
03:07 - do it as if i was a real hacker
03:09 - okay oh so that's right this talks for
03:11 - operation luigi's or the picture of
03:12 - luigi at the beginning you might be
03:14 - wondering why is this talk called
03:15 - operation
03:16 - luigi in the interest of timeless you
03:18 - can get straight to it the first thing
03:20 - we have to do is find out what her email
03:21 - address is even though we already know
03:22 - we have to find it and so i was like
03:24 - okay well i'm using this advanced
03:26 - hacking software um and i'm going to
03:28 - just uh put her name into it and the
03:29 - word linkedin and linkedin just tells me
03:31 - here's what her email address is because
03:33 - linkedin encourages you hey put your
03:34 - email address on linkedin so people can
03:36 - find you people like me um not really
03:39 - mostly recruiters but also people like
03:40 - me
03:41 - i notice it's a hotmail email address
03:42 - and i'm like oh maybe this is wrong
03:43 - maybe this is old because like no one's
03:46 - using hotmail still are they and so um
03:49 - but so then i went to her twitter
03:51 - i wanted to know whether this was her
03:52 - real email or her main email address i
03:54 - went to her twitter and if you try and
03:56 - reset your password on twitter it will
03:58 - say
03:58 - sure you can reset your password we're
04:00 - going to email a link to and then it
04:01 - will give you most of the email address
04:02 - it'll give you a few letters and the
04:04 - domain
04:05 - and i was like cool this means this is
04:07 - this means the hotmail one is a current
04:08 - email address weird people whether she's
04:11 - still using hotmail just but okay
04:13 - uh also this screenshot is old this
04:15 - doesn't happen anymore twitter doesn't
04:16 - let you do this anymore if you go and
04:18 - reset your password on twitter right now
04:19 - it'll be like sure you can reset your
04:21 - password type in the email address that
04:23 - you use to log into this twitter account
04:24 - tell us the email address and then we'll
04:25 - give you a link presumably to prevent
04:27 - this so good stuff twitter
04:29 - okay so now i have to get a phone number
04:31 - i think by the way i'm not this is my
04:32 - first time like hacking someone anything
04:35 - and so i'm like i don't really know what
04:36 - i'm doing but i've seen other people do
04:38 - it at conferences so i'm like i think i
04:39 - just need to collect everything that can
04:41 - be collected about this person first
04:42 - then somehow it'll somehow hacking will
04:45 - happen
04:45 - and so i'm like okay um here's okay i've
04:48 - got an email address and i'll put the
04:49 - word phone into my advanced hacking
04:51 - software i've actually obscured the name
04:52 - of the hacking software so you can't
04:54 - tell which one it is because it's so
04:55 - powerful
04:56 - um
04:57 - and
04:58 - so
04:59 - i do this and there's like a page and
05:01 - just says like hey do you want to sign
05:02 - up to this club because she's like the
05:03 - head of some sort of club and says
05:05 - contact anna at this email address this
05:06 - phone number because like she just put
05:08 - it on there online because she wanted to
05:09 - be found and so like this is not i'm not
05:11 - saying she's dumb or bad for doing this
05:13 - this is totally normal right you have to
05:14 - have some sort of privacy trade-off if
05:16 - you're going to like advertise yourself
05:18 - which is what you need to do if you're
05:19 - organizing a club or anything so like
05:22 - what can you do about that right if you
05:24 - want to organize a club you got to put
05:24 - some sort of contact information on the
05:26 - internet it works for me and so now i'm
05:28 - like okay what do i do i have the i have
05:30 - the email address and phone number what
05:32 - do i do now uh okay um
05:34 - um maybe i should i went to a lot of
05:36 - conferences and they say you have to
05:37 - email someone a word document with
05:39 - macros in it and then they click the
05:40 - macros and then you have control of the
05:41 - computer and i was like okay well i
05:43 - don't really know how to do that um
05:45 - also
05:46 - does she even have a laptop maybe she
05:47 - just has a phone
05:48 - also like if i got control of the
05:50 - computer then what would i do that would
05:51 - what would i i would probably just try
05:52 - and get her browser cookies and log into
05:54 - cloud stuff anyway so maybe i don't
05:56 - actually want control of the computer
05:56 - maybe i want her like
05:58 - say like email and passwords and stuff
06:00 - and so okay i'm not gonna do this this
06:01 - is too hard maybe i can just maybe i'll
06:03 - try and hack into email first and then i
06:05 - can decide what to do because her email
06:06 - is kind of like
06:08 - you know the the the
06:10 - keys to the kingdom sort of the top of
06:11 - everything if you can hack if you can
06:12 - get into someone's email then you can
06:14 - use the email to reset their twitter and
06:15 - reset their other stuff and get into all
06:17 - their other accounts so i'm going to try
06:18 - and go for that this is what this is
06:19 - what i justified this to myself it was
06:21 - late at night whatever
06:22 - um okay so now i have to get her email
06:24 - password note that i can't get into her
06:25 - email any other way
06:27 - i have to actually know her email
06:28 - password and type it in and log in at
06:30 - the same time as her because if i got
06:31 - into her email any other way by like
06:33 - pretending to be here and resetting it
06:34 - she will get kicked out of it so she has
06:36 - to also still be an email and also not
06:37 - know that i'm also in an email so the
06:39 - only way i can do this is by just
06:40 - getting the password which is what i'm
06:42 - trying to do
06:43 - um there's this great website for
06:44 - getting passwords um
06:46 - called have i been owned owned a lot of
06:48 - controversy on how to pronounce that
06:50 - and uh you left you uh put in an email
06:53 - address and it will tell you which of
06:54 - the like public data breaches they're
06:56 - called that email address appears in so
06:59 - you can put in your email and it will
07:00 - tell you yeah like linkedin got hacked
07:02 - in 2012 and your email was in there so
07:05 - some hacker has your linkedin password
07:06 - and it will tell you that for all the
07:07 - different sites that have been hacked
07:09 - that the all the different ones that
07:10 - this website knows about
07:12 - um clever nowhere does it say that you
07:14 - need to put in your email address so
07:15 - very cleverly i put in her email address
07:18 - and i find that she's at the time of
07:20 - writing
07:21 - um she was only in uh she was in a few
07:23 - the only interesting ones where patreon
07:24 - and tumblr patreon didn't have passwords
07:26 - tumblr was the only one that had
07:28 - passwords in the like data breach thing
07:30 - and so i was like okay cool i know my
07:31 - friend's like password is on the
07:33 - internet now i know it's on this it's in
07:34 - this tumblr thing um this is great so
07:38 - now uh the tumblr password dump is
07:40 - something that i just happen to have
07:42 - lying around and so it looks like this
07:45 - it's a big text file and it's just got
07:47 - the email address and then a column and
07:48 - the password hash and hackers are not
07:50 - very good at documenting their stuff and
07:51 - so they don't really say what kind of
07:53 - password hashes they are just a text
07:54 - file
07:55 - i looked around the internet and people
07:56 - seem to think that they're shy one
07:58 - hashes with a static salt and i'm like
07:59 - cool what does that mean and so
08:02 - let me explain what a static salt is
08:04 - um so imagine you're
08:06 - like i don't know a website let's call
08:07 - them tumblr
08:08 - and you're storing like emails and
08:10 - passwords uh this is one where you could
08:12 - do it you could store the email address
08:14 - of the person and you could also just
08:16 - store their password because then when
08:17 - they log in you know whether they typed
08:18 - in the right password because you have
08:19 - their password but then you go to a
08:21 - security conference and they tell you
08:22 - you're not allowed to do that so okay
08:24 - actually you need to hash the passwords
08:25 - so this way you don't store the password
08:27 - you store this like scrambled up version
08:29 - of it and then you can then you don't
08:30 - have to ch and you don't have to um keep
08:32 - a copy of the user's password but you
08:33 - can still check whether they type the
08:34 - right password in
08:35 - so okay now it's drawing password hashes
08:37 - and you're like am i doing it now and
08:38 - people at security conferences are like
08:40 - no this is not good enough you need to
08:42 - do the salting thing now and so now
08:44 - you need to before you hash before you
08:45 - hash the password you need to add a
08:47 - random string to the end of it just in
08:48 - case somebody has a big list of the hash
08:50 - of every possible like
08:51 - eight character string then they could
08:53 - possibly use that to like reverse what
08:55 - your hash was back into the password so
08:56 - you have to add this salt thing to the
08:58 - end and so you go okay okay and so now
09:00 - you're adding this salt and you add all
09:01 - the end of the password it's like this
09:03 - this is called a static sort and static
09:04 - means it's the same for all the
09:05 - passwords
09:07 - and so now you're adding the same thing
09:09 - to the end of every single password and
09:10 - the point of this is to prevent somebody
09:12 - with a big list of
09:14 - the hash of every single string from
09:16 - using that big list to reverse your
09:17 - password hashes
09:19 - but do you see the problem here the
09:21 - problem is that these two parts these
09:22 - two users have the same password and
09:24 - because we're adding the same thing to
09:26 - the end of the password the same the
09:28 - same static so the thing that's getting
09:30 - hashed is the same for both of these
09:31 - people in fact they're going to have the
09:32 - same password if and only if they have
09:34 - the same password hash and so even when
09:36 - we hash everything you can see these two
09:37 - these two users have the same password
09:39 - hash you don't know what it is you don't
09:40 - know what the password is but you know
09:41 - these two people have the same password
09:43 - because of the static salt thing
09:45 - uh so why am i telling you all about
09:46 - this static sold thing it's because i
09:48 - don't know what the soft is for the
09:50 - tumbler password dump even though it's
09:51 - the salt it's not meant to be a secret
09:52 - thing it's meant to be like public it's
09:53 - meant to be as public as like the
09:55 - usernames
09:56 - but i don't know what it is because it's
09:57 - not included in the text file because
09:58 - hackers are not good at documenting
10:00 - their stuff
10:01 - um so i'm like okay i really want to i
10:03 - really want to get my friends password
10:04 - out of this but i don't know how um so
10:08 - the first thing i did when i had the
10:09 - list was i searched for my friend's
10:10 - email address and i'm like okay if i
10:12 - grab for her email address i'll get all
10:14 - the lines that have her email address in
10:15 - it which is just the one with their
10:16 - password hash in it i'm like cool but i
10:18 - don't know what this don't know what
10:19 - this password hash goes to i don't know
10:21 - what password this password hash is of
10:24 - so here's the sneaky thing i do uh i
10:26 - search for her password hash in the file
10:28 - not her password just her password hash
10:30 - like an absolute madman because uh well
10:33 - what do you think will happen what do
10:34 - you think will happen when i type in her
10:36 - like when i grip for her password it
10:37 - should just be one like it should just
10:39 - be her line right should just have my
10:41 - friend dana's thing there's like 20
10:43 - people who have the the same
10:45 - have the same password hash right and
10:46 - these people it's like a little pathway
10:48 - book club right they can all get along
10:50 - and
10:51 - these these fun these fun little book
10:53 - enthusiasts all have the same password
10:54 - on tumblr and so this tells me a few
10:56 - things um probably it's not a very good
10:58 - password since all these people have
10:59 - thought of the same one but again i'm
11:02 - very smug but i don't know what it is so
11:03 - i need to find out what it is and so
11:05 - here's what i do i get
11:07 - just the email addresses of those people
11:09 - in the password book club i throw away
11:10 - the password hashes don't know what i
11:11 - don't know what to do with the hash just
11:12 - get those email addresses these are all
11:14 - the people who have the same password as
11:15 - diana and then conveniently did you know
11:17 - that linkedin was also hacked in 2012
11:19 - and uh dan dana was not in this list
11:22 - because she didn't have linkedin in 2012
11:23 - but lots of people were and thanks to
11:25 - the hard work and gpu cycles of people
11:27 - in the password cracking community
11:28 - almost all those linkedin passwords are
11:30 - in plain text now they're not just
11:31 - hashes their emails and like you know
11:33 - just passwords you can just look at with
11:34 - your eyes
11:36 - and i was like wow i also just happen to
11:38 - have that lying around and so
11:40 - then i did this thing where i looked up
11:42 - the same people who in the password book
11:44 - club in the tumblr list in the linkedin
11:46 - list
11:47 - and i found
11:48 - most of them not all about 80 of them
11:51 - had the same password as each other on
11:53 - linkedin as well so isn't that really
11:54 - sweet that book club transcends like
11:56 - services
11:57 - um
11:58 - and i thought it was sweet and uh i
12:01 - found that most of them had the password
12:03 - query one and so this is a bit of a
12:04 - there's a bit of like a bit of a jump
12:06 - here but i'm guessing that
12:08 - my friend dana has the same password as
12:10 - all these people on tumblr okay i'm not
12:11 - guessing that's definitely true and then
12:13 - i'm guessing that they'll have the same
12:14 - password on linkedin and then i'm
12:16 - guessing that that password is this most
12:18 - frequent one this quote query one thing
12:19 - i'm guessing that that's diana's
12:20 - password and i'm like okay i've done it
12:22 - let's go uh cordy wants down the
12:24 - password i did it i'm hacking let's go
12:26 - it's time to use this thing i got
12:27 - hotmail type in and it's not the right
12:29 - password like that's not a hotmail
12:30 - password it was that was it wasn't it
12:32 - and i was like well damn why did i do
12:35 - all this work
12:37 - why did i go to all these great lengths
12:38 - okay whatever um
12:40 - so then i go to facebook and so i don't
12:42 - just try it on her hotmail i tried on
12:43 - everything i go to facebook and uh it
12:46 - says oh no that's not your facebook
12:47 - password but it's an old password it was
12:50 - your password about five months ago
12:52 - i'm like oh thanks facebook for taunting
12:54 - me i guess i'm too late um
12:57 - but i mean like okay so this did used to
12:58 - be her password she just happens to have
13:00 - changed it recently and i've somehow
13:02 - stumbled upon a person it has more than
13:03 - one password in their life um so i'm
13:05 - like okay fine i guess it's the hard way
13:07 - um which is what i didn't want to have
13:08 - to do so by the way uh this this is what
13:11 - i had planned this is what i thought
13:12 - this like hacking would be like i was
13:14 - going to be like ah it's so easy to hack
13:16 - someone you just look them up and all
13:17 - these lists you have lying around and
13:18 - it's as easy as that and so the rest of
13:20 - this talk will be about how it's not as
13:21 - easy as that always
13:22 - and so i'm like okay i guess i'm going
13:23 - to try and do this fishing thing i'm
13:24 - going to try and trick her into sending
13:26 - me the password because everyone else is
13:27 - doing it it's more work it's way more
13:29 - it's more work because you have to make
13:30 - something custom but like oh well
13:32 - i don't know is this how you do fishing
13:33 - i don't know it's my first time maybe i
13:34 - should do something like this
13:43 - i don't know you don't know that you
13:44 - don't know that it won't work
13:46 - um so now i'm not going to do that i'm
13:47 - going to do this
13:48 - here's the plan i come up with i'm going
13:49 - to send her a fake email from microsoft
13:50 - because she has hotmail it has to be
13:51 - microsoft and that email is going to
13:53 - take her to a login screen for hotmail
13:54 - but it's a fake login screen that
13:56 - actually sends me a password and then
13:57 - she'll go to the real hotmail login
13:58 - screen and just kind of keep going as if
14:00 - nothing happened this is my plan i don't
14:01 - know don't whatever
14:03 - and so um but to do this i'm going to
14:05 - need to make a hotmail account to send
14:06 - the email from so i go to i go to make a
14:09 - hotmail account which will let me open a
14:11 - world of benefits and i try to make one
14:13 - that looks like microsoft i try to make
14:15 - a microsoft account team and says no you
14:17 - can't do that presumably because the
14:19 - word microsoft is in the email address
14:21 - and they know i'm not microsoft and so i
14:22 - try to make my first name microsoft and
14:24 - my last name account team and they're
14:25 - like no you can't do that
14:28 - and presumably to stop exactly what i'm
14:29 - trying to do and fair enough however
14:32 - these are my round friends and
14:34 - they're these look like two o's don't
14:36 - they looks like i put two o's in this
14:37 - slide like an absolute fool but actually
14:40 - one of them is an o and one of them is a
14:41 - greek letter omicron which looks a lot
14:43 - like an o to you and me doesn't it but
14:45 - to a computer they're completely
14:46 - different like unicode code points
14:48 - and so
14:49 - like if you just spell microsoft like
14:51 - this with these omicrons then like that
14:54 - doesn't say microsoft but like to you
14:56 - and me it looks like it does
14:58 - and so like does this really work i'm
15:00 - sure you're wondering like
15:04 - surely like
15:05 - surely the billions of dollars at
15:07 - microsoft and the most advanced mines
15:09 - aren't going to be full but no does work
15:10 - yeah it does
15:12 - and so i make this i make this microsoft
15:14 - account team thing and i send it this
15:15 - email which says like i copied this from
15:17 - like a real microsoft email that i got i
15:19 - copied all the like styling and most of
15:20 - the text and it says oh you better log
15:23 - into your account in the next 48 hours
15:24 - or we're gonna lock it um oh please do
15:27 - it or it's gonna be real bad this
15:29 - oh boy there's like russians ipad
15:32 - dresses you wouldn't want that i don't
15:33 - know
15:35 - um and so it says like come and log in
15:37 - please
15:38 - um but again this is just an email like
15:40 - that link that that don't lock his
15:42 - account thing at the bottom there has to
15:43 - be a link to something
15:44 - and so i need to make that i need to
15:46 - make a website for that bottom button to
15:47 - link to so okay let's go this is the
15:49 - real what my login screen it was at the
15:51 - time and so i'm gonna uh i need to make
15:54 - a copy of this and so there's another
15:55 - way to make a copy of things there's
15:56 - this hacking tools technique i learned
15:58 - about where stuff
15:59 - have you seen this before step one if
16:01 - you right click on something step two
16:02 - you hit this button
16:04 - and when you hit that inspect element
16:05 - button that's the good stuff
16:09 - i think there are easier ways to copy
16:10 - websites but i always do it this way
16:12 - anyway so here's my copy of the website
16:14 - it looks the same because it is the same
16:16 - um but this time it's on my computer
16:18 - it's on localhost and so now i need to
16:19 - put on the internet somehow um and so
16:22 - i'm like how do i put this i can't link
16:23 - her to localhost how do i put this
16:24 - online and i found this like
16:27 - static hosting company website thing
16:29 - they're not paying me to say this but
16:31 - they have like they let you like host
16:32 - static files on the internet and this is
16:34 - really good because you get a custom
16:35 - subdomain so you can be anything dot
16:36 - aerobatic.io and they give you https for
16:39 - free and it's like two commands or
16:40 - something to do it and no one knows
16:42 - about it so all the good subdomains
16:43 - aren't taken um so like i'm sure it's a
16:45 - good static hosting site but it happens
16:47 - to also be a really good phishing
16:48 - hosting site so um thank you to these
16:50 - people
16:52 - you can use the promo code diana to be
16:53 - immediately reported to the authorities
16:57 - uh this so this is the one i made this
16:58 - is the um the
17:01 - the domain i chose
17:02 - the real hotmail login screen is like
17:04 - the real hotmail login domain is
17:05 - login.live.com
17:07 - and so i could have like made my own
17:09 - domain name and like made it look even
17:10 - more similar but i just don't think
17:11 - diana's going to look at this at the the
17:14 - url very much because she's not like a
17:16 - paranoid security person like us so
17:19 - um but then again for some reason login
17:22 - when you go to like a login screen the
17:23 - url doesn't look like that it looks like
17:25 - this it has a bunch of like stuff at the
17:26 - end and so i just added a bunch of stuff
17:28 - at the end
17:32 - like it
17:33 - it doesn't do anything i actually stole
17:34 - it from the google login screen um
17:36 - but
17:38 - whatever okay it's my first time and so
17:40 - here it is this is my fake login screen
17:42 - on the internet now i know it's the same
17:44 - picture but this time on the internet
17:45 - trust me um and so i also add these
17:47 - bonus features to it um the first one is
17:49 - that after she clicks the the login
17:52 - button the submit button
17:54 - it's going to add an image to the page
17:55 - and the image goes to a website i
17:57 - control forward slash diana and then
17:59 - question mark and then plus whatever
18:00 - password is
18:02 - so the reason i'm doing this is to try
18:03 - and steal whatever just trying to steal
18:04 - a password this is like a terrible awful
18:06 - way to do it that you probably shouldn't
18:07 - do but it's really easy
18:09 - so like i'm going to get a request to my
18:11 - website forward slash diana and then
18:14 - plus some password i don't know what
18:15 - this password is so it's going to be a
18:17 - 404 but then in my logs it's going to be
18:19 - a request for a 404 to diana and then
18:21 - the password so i'm just going to be
18:22 - looking at my logs for this diana thing
18:23 - and when it shows up i'll be like ah
18:24 - that's the password
18:26 - and then i make it so that after she
18:27 - clicks the button it waits one second
18:29 - and then goes to the real hotmail login
18:30 - screen the one second way to simulate
18:32 - australian internet speeds
18:33 - [Laughter]
18:36 - anyway here's the email i send it's like
18:37 - you know look out it's something real
18:39 - bad's gonna happen and you only got 48
18:40 - hours because i'm creating time pressure
18:42 - and i'm doing all the good stuff i've
18:43 - seen random phishing emails do but i
18:45 - kind of just want this to work so come
18:46 - on click click the link and so i send it
18:49 - to her and search your anastasia 48
18:50 - hours and then 24 hours later nothing
18:52 - happens i'm looking at my logs and she's
18:54 - not there
18:54 - so i'm like she hasn't clicked on it yet
18:56 - and so i'm like oh okay uh so i sent the
18:58 - email again saying like same thing but
19:00 - now you only have 48 hours and now you
19:01 - only have 24 hours you better click it
19:03 - and then 48 hours later she also doesn't
19:06 - click on it and i'm like oh okay
19:09 - all right like at this point i'm not
19:11 - actually hacking anyone i'm just
19:12 - emailing my friend
19:14 - i'm like okay that's a shame i guess it
19:16 - wasn't interesting enough email and fair
19:17 - enough the thing i learned from this is
19:19 - that people don't really care about
19:21 - emails from microsoft or about like
19:23 - emails from like like automated emails i
19:24 - care about emails from people which
19:26 - leads me to the next way i try and do
19:28 - this
19:29 - which is like okay she's gonna be like
19:30 - on the internet whatever and she's gonna
19:32 - get an email from a recruiter and the
19:33 - recruiter is gonna
19:35 - link her to another fake to the same
19:36 - fake login page and then you're going to
19:38 - go to a google doc and the login page is
19:40 - going to make a login to see a google
19:41 - doc is that such but this is microsoft
19:43 - this is hotmail hotmail doesn't have
19:44 - google docs is there such thing as
19:45 - microsoft google docs and so i look it
19:47 - up is this is that a thing is that a
19:48 - real thing and there is and it's called
19:50 - cloud sky something something something
19:51 - something something
19:52 - and like
19:54 - and so i'm like great and so i log into
19:56 - this and make oh no i think i make the
19:58 - make the document in something else and
20:00 - then copy and paste it into this
20:02 - um and so now i have a microsoft google
20:03 - doc and you might be wondering what
20:05 - document i made i made a resume like i
20:07 - think like fake but convincing looking
20:08 - resume and then i send her oh no before
20:11 - i do that i have to make the person
20:12 - who's going to send it to her i can't
20:13 - email her for me can't email her from a
20:14 - microsoft account team so i guess it's
20:16 - going to have to be from this fake
20:18 - person
20:19 - and so i go to the google login screen
20:21 - you can put whatever you want in these
20:22 - boxes it's very good and so i make this
20:24 - person called kathleen wheeler who's
20:25 - like a mix of a first name and last name
20:27 - from a real company that i found
20:29 - and then i sent her this which says this
20:31 - is me writing this sometimes i sound
20:32 - like i'm a recruiter i don't really know
20:34 - what could it sound like and i'm saying
20:36 - hey i work at this comedy company which
20:38 - you care about um which i looked up
20:39 - earlier on linkedin and uh somebody has
20:42 - listed you as a reference somebody has
20:43 - told us that you work together like
20:45 - somebody has said that they worked with
20:46 - you
20:47 - uh here's the resume tell us how you
20:49 - know them blah blah blah click here for
20:50 - the resume that link is obviously the
20:51 - one that goes to the fake login screen
20:53 - and then after all this text being like
20:55 - can you fill out this form and tell us
20:56 - these things and blah blah blah that's
20:58 - just to distract from the link and then
20:59 - it says also can uh can you let me a
21:01 - good time to call you is the phone
21:03 - number her phone number which i found
21:04 - earlier okay the reason i put a phone
21:06 - number there so she knows this is like
21:07 - for her it's not like an accident like
21:08 - this person clearly knows who she is
21:11 - and then i made a sweet email signature
21:13 - at the bottom with like a different font
21:14 - and everything i thought it was really
21:15 - good attention to detail or whatever
21:17 - and so i sent this to her and it totally
21:19 - works like she clicks it she taps in a
21:21 - password like the whole thing just works
21:23 - flawlessly and i was like wow that was
21:24 - really easy and then i looked a little
21:26 - bit closer and i'm like wait a minute
21:28 - this password that she sent me that's
21:30 - that's corey one that's i already have
21:31 - that one like that's already that's i
21:34 - already
21:38 - i was like what that's
21:40 - how could that did i do something wrong
21:41 - and then i was like no wait a minute
21:42 - here's what i've learned she does not
21:44 - know how to help me out that's what it
21:45 - is
21:49 - which which which in many ways is the
21:51 - ultimate defense against people
21:55 - so like don't don't don't shame her for
21:57 - this but also because my fake login
21:59 - screen will just say yes no matter what
22:00 - password you type in and actually thinks
22:02 - this is a
22:03 - password
22:05 - yeah
22:06 - and i'm like whoops i hope i can fix
22:07 - that after this is all over anyway
22:10 - so i up instead of giving up i update my
22:12 - login screen so now no matter what you
22:13 - type in it just says wrong password the
22:15 - first three times
22:16 - because my theory is that people who
22:17 - like memorize all their passwords
22:19 - uh they just try one and if it doesn't
22:21 - work let's try the other one and the
22:22 - other one they just unload all their
22:23 - passwords into the form
22:25 - and so um i also change it so if you try
22:27 - a qwerty one the counter doesn't go up
22:28 - so you can't just type 21 three times
22:30 - and so then i send her out then she
22:32 - replies and she's like no i haven't
22:33 - worked with this person which is true
22:34 - because i don't exist uh and then she's
22:36 - like yeah you can call me that's the
22:38 - right phone number and i'm not going to
22:39 - call her because i'm not capitalizing
22:41 - out and then i'm like then i have a
22:43 - reply being like oops that was the wrong
22:45 - resume oh for some reason you better
22:46 - click on this this makes no sense right
22:49 - like like if you think about this like
22:51 - if you stop and think about this oh
22:52 - there's another person who also worked
22:53 - with you around the same time but with
22:55 - different dates today and i sent you
22:56 - their resume instead of the other that
22:57 - doesn't make any sense right like this
22:59 - story doesn't work but it has the same
23:01 - like bait of like somebody says they
23:03 - know you and you have to click to find
23:04 - out who
23:05 - and so i'm like you know pl please just
23:07 - click on it anyway please i know um and
23:10 - she does and this time same thing
23:12 - happens she clicks on it and she like
23:13 - types in a thing she types the same
23:14 - thing three times which is this other
23:16 - password which looks a lot like cody one
23:18 - um oh also none of these are real but
23:19 - they're similar to what they actually
23:20 - were um this one's like shifted along by
23:22 - one on the keyboard i'm like hmm okay
23:24 - what's this password and so i go to
23:26 - hotmail and like using my using the
23:28 - advanced hacking software google chrome
23:29 - type the password into the hotmail login
23:31 - screen and press enter and it totally
23:33 - works i get into email and i'm like it's
23:35 - as easy as that everybody
23:42 - see it's simple
23:44 - okay so i did i got an email password
23:45 - but now what do i do like
23:47 - i try the same password on everything
23:49 - and it doesn't work i'm like great this
23:50 - person has three passwords in their
23:52 - lives
23:53 - and then she replies being like no i
23:54 - haven't worked with this person either
23:55 - why are you doing this what what's
23:57 - happening and i reply just being like
23:59 - don't worry about it don't stress about
24:01 - it you know i'll just handle it
24:03 - please don't email me anymore please
24:05 - just forget about this
24:06 - and she does she doesn't reply so i'm
24:08 - like great
24:09 - meanwhile i log into email and i click
24:11 - on i want to search for more passwords
24:12 - so i can log into more stuff
24:15 - and so i like click on the search bar
24:17 - thing and it shows me her last five
24:18 - searches and i'm like oh but the last
24:20 - five searches aren't anything
24:21 - interesting
24:22 - um but i want to search for like
24:23 - password and other things but if i do it
24:25 - then she'll see there's in her search
24:26 - history right so uh
24:28 - i write down the last five things she
24:30 - searched for and then search for my
24:32 - stuff and then search for those things
24:33 - in reverse so
24:35 - so it looks exactly the same
24:37 - because it only shows the last five
24:39 - microsoft knows what i've done but i i'm
24:41 - doing it anyway um and it totally works
24:43 - but i didn't find any passwords because
24:45 - i don't know i found a lot of passwords
24:47 - i already had but i didn't find any new
24:48 - passwords and i was like fine whatever
24:51 - so this is the end of the talk i guess
24:52 - that's it i mean our email never believe
24:53 - it when it says the end question mark no
24:55 - it's obviously not the end geez um the
24:57 - stock is called operation let's talk is
24:58 - called operation luigi and i'm like
24:59 - already in my friend's email you know
25:01 - it'd be a real shame to just kind of
25:02 - leave it at that you know be real shame
25:04 - to not like do anything with that so
25:06 - here's what operation luigi is here's
25:08 - what we need to do first thing is get
25:09 - into her twitter second thing is to not
25:10 - lock her out of her twitter because she
25:11 - needs to be in there too and also don't
25:13 - let her know that i'm in her stuff don't
25:14 - know they don't have to know that i'm in
25:16 - her twitter um so here's how i do it i
25:18 - go to twitter and i'll be like hey i
25:19 - forgot my password until it lets me
25:21 - reset it and like you know because i'm
25:22 - in her email now and so i can reset the
25:24 - password because it'll send me the email
25:25 - and i can click it and i can do that now
25:27 - and so i changed her twitter password to
25:29 - qwerty1
25:30 - and so
25:34 - that's because this is the password that
25:35 - i think she thinks her password is
25:38 - and there's a little emails and blah
25:39 - blah blah wait for her to log in and
25:40 - because i need her to log in so i know
25:42 - that she's actually type 21 and she's
25:43 - back in her own account and i wait a
25:45 - while and then eventually she actually
25:46 - logs in and i'm like great it works she
25:48 - retweets she reshooted a picture of a
25:49 - dog and i was like yes
25:50 - okay so then i do the exact same thing
25:52 - with linkedin as i did with twitter and
25:54 - i try to change the linkedin password to
25:56 - kodi one as well but it doesn't let me
25:58 - presume because i got the qwerty one
26:00 - from the linkedin password jump so they
26:01 - know it's bad then there's a little box
26:03 - at the bottom which says require all
26:04 - devices to sign in with a new password
26:06 - which is like would you like to sign me
26:07 - out on like would you like to sign out
26:09 - all your other devices and i'm like
26:10 - absolutely not thank you linkedin for
26:12 - giving me this option it's unchecked by
26:14 - default so i can just change your
26:15 - password without even signing her out
26:16 - and so i just do that and then i log in
26:19 - and so okay now what let me explain so
26:21 - this picture of obama is here because i
26:22 - can't show you down as real pictures i
26:24 - have to show you uh because i can't show
26:26 - you how real profile pictures i'm going
26:27 - to show you what i did to her real
26:28 - profile pictures but with pictures of
26:29 - obama i don't know just go with it and
26:32 - so here's what her twitter picture was
26:33 - and i changed it to be like this i don't
26:35 - know if you can tell there's like
26:37 - it's like a low
26:38 - there's like a lightly transparent luigi
26:40 - there and so also she had a linkedin
26:42 - picture and i changed the linkedin
26:43 - picture to have like another luigi on it
26:45 - can you see it and so i just left it
26:47 - there for like i don't know weeks i
26:48 - don't know okay yeah good weeks i just
26:50 - left it there and no one said anything
26:51 - and i said okay i thought she might have
26:52 - noticed then but this is sort of like
26:54 - proof that i got somewhere and so you
26:56 - know nothing happened so i was like okay
26:58 - well was this over this was operational
27:00 - luigi because it's not over the
27:01 - remainder of this talk will be about
27:02 - operation waluigi
27:05 - and you know i came up with this like a
27:07 - long time ago back when this meme was
27:09 - like you know new anyway whatever
27:11 - waluigi let's go so i changed her link i
27:13 - changed her linkedin bio to be the
27:14 - entire wikipedia page for luigi
27:17 - and when i do this linkedin says her
27:19 - profile strength is advanced so thank
27:20 - you linkedin
27:23 - thank you linkedin for being there for
27:24 - me this entire talk
27:26 - anyway i changed her twitter to be this
27:27 - like
27:28 - i i want to make it super obvious so she
27:30 - i wanted to know that i'm there i want i
27:32 - want to be caught now like i'm trying to
27:33 - be caught i'm like hello notice me i'm
27:34 - very loud i tweet this from her account
27:37 - just go for it and she's online at the
27:39 - same time because it's like 7pm
27:41 - and she replies and she says omg to this
27:43 - thing and she says i've been hacked my
27:45 - dudes but then because i'm also logged
27:46 - in at the same time i reply as her
27:48 - saying oh no no
27:57 - it just seemed like the right thing to
27:58 - do at the time
27:59 - anyway then i tweet this then i create
28:00 - this and i keep doing things until she
28:02 - messages me and i treat longings for the
28:03 - days of this sweet lad and keep tweeting
28:05 - things and eventually she messages me
28:06 - and be like oh my gosh my twitter is
28:07 - this you and i'm like yes it's me don't
28:09 - worry nothing bad's happening i'll stop
28:11 - now it's all congratulations i guess you
28:12 - got me um and here's what happened after
28:15 - that um she loves her new waluigi life
28:17 - so much she goes and changes her
28:18 - facebook to be a waluigi themed even
28:20 - though i didn't even touch it
28:22 - um she listens to she's like gets really
28:23 - into luigi culture i'm not going to read
28:25 - this that like she like
28:30 - she like really got into it and she also
28:32 - asked me like wow how do i not get
28:33 - hacked like how do i what did i do wrong
28:34 - i'm like well you didn't do anything
28:35 - wrong
28:36 - but like this is kind of a question that
28:38 - people ask a lot right people ask
28:39 - security people like how do i stay safe
28:41 - what should i be doing online and these
28:42 - are just like regular people who ask
28:44 - this like not security people they're
28:45 - just like normal people they're not
28:47 - weird like us and they say oh how do i
28:49 - stay safe and sometimes the kind of
28:51 - answers they hear from security people
28:52 - are like oh you got to do all these
28:54 - things and live in a submarine and never
28:56 - go anywhere and you get to get all this
28:58 - advanced multi-factor ub keys
29:01 - or whatever
29:02 - and so like there are other things you
29:04 - can say you know
29:05 - so here's what i told her i was like
29:07 - well listen it's up to you right like
29:08 - there are things you can do to stay safe
29:10 - there are things you can do that they
29:11 - eat like there are things you can do to
29:13 - stay safe but they involve investing
29:14 - more time and effort it's up to you how
29:16 - much your investors up to you how much
29:17 - you care about this maybe you don't care
29:18 - and your finder is getting hacked that's
29:19 - okay that's a valid way to live your
29:21 - life
29:22 - um and so i help her set up two factor
29:23 - auth on her email because i'm about to
29:27 - do this blog post and publish a guide on
29:28 - how to hack her so i don't want it to be
29:30 - repeatable
29:31 - and so help her set up two factor
29:32 - authors so now she'll get a code on her
29:33 - phone which will be would have been way
29:34 - harder for me to get past because it's
29:36 - way harder to get past two factors you
29:37 - have to like i don't know fish the
29:39 - two-factor auth code or socially
29:40 - engineered the phone company too hard
29:42 - and so she was very happy that it wasn't
29:43 - that hard she was very happy that she
29:44 - could just do this and it wasn't like
29:46 - much extra effort for her because this
29:48 - is like the
29:49 - lowest effort highest security value
29:51 - thing i think that she could have done
29:53 - um and so she has a little app like this
29:54 - you know you know how to actually she
29:56 - has this little app and she's like yeah
29:57 - now i can just type in these codes
29:58 - um these backup codes are kind of a trap
30:00 - though and i kind of warned about only
30:02 - using the app because see that button
30:03 - that's like uh
30:05 - you know saved a text file or keep these
30:06 - codes somewhere safe no one clicks those
30:08 - buttons everyone's just like yeah
30:09 - whatever clothes like no one keeps these
30:10 - backup codes and so um that's why it's
30:13 - that's one of the reasons that's good
30:14 - type sms as a backup
30:16 - anyway in conclusion i just talked about
30:17 - luigi for like a long time so i hope you
30:19 - liked it and
30:21 - oh the last thing is you might be
30:22 - wondering like where did i get these
30:24 - before i was like oh i had these lying
30:25 - around probably wondering where did i
30:27 - get the like linkedin and tumblr like
30:28 - password hashes where did where do they
30:30 - actually come from
