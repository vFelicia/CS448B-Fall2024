00:00 - in these videos we are going to be
00:01 - talking about the document object model
00:04 - also known as the Dom the Doom you'll
00:06 - see that referred to a lot particularly
00:08 - as you work with jQuery which we'll get
00:10 - into a little bit later the document
00:13 - object model is the browser's internal
00:16 - programmatic representation of the web
00:18 - page what that means is you can
00:21 - manipulate the document object model and
00:23 - change the page without actually going
00:26 - in and changing any of the HTML now you
00:28 - have to use a right Lang anguage like
00:30 - JavaScript or a library of JavaScript
00:32 - like jQuery to access and talk to the
00:35 - Dom but it can be a really powerful tool
00:37 - both as a programmer and as a user of
00:40 - websites technically the Dom is also an
00:43 - API if you're not familiar with apis
00:45 - that's fine but remember this is a type
00:47 - of API apis are really powerful and can
00:50 - do a lot of things if you've already
00:52 - been using JavaScript and particularly
00:53 - jQuery you've already been working with
00:55 - the Dom it's pretty inuitive once you
00:58 - get used to a language like jQuery let's
01:00 - talk about some examples of document
01:02 - object model manipulation these examples
01:05 - are pure JavaScript just pure vanilla
01:07 - JavaScript document. get element by ID
01:10 - and then the ID is something that maybe
01:13 - you've seen before in some of the
01:14 - earlier challenges element get Elements
01:17 - by a tag name is another example and if
01:19 - you want to create something totally new
01:21 - document. create element and then the
01:23 - name of that element you don't have to
01:25 - remember this this is not a lesson on
01:27 - how to manipulate the document object
01:29 - model just that sort of How It's
01:32 - possible you understand the concept and
01:34 - if you already are using some of these
01:36 - examples maybe you can connect those
01:38 - dots a little bit better let's talk
01:40 - about some jQuery
01:43 - examples for this example in jQuery
01:46 - there's the same jQuery notation with
01:48 - the dollar sign and in here it's got the
01:51 - the hashtag for the class um so here
01:54 - it's selecting the box two class and
01:56 - it's appending adding the string this is
02:00 - now in box two so if you've already done
02:02 - the jQuery challenges you might be like
02:04 - oh yeah I recognize that kind of stuff
02:06 - what you've been doing is manipulating
02:08 - the document object model to actually
02:10 - change what's being displayed on the web
02:12 - page without changing the HTML what I
02:15 - want you to take away from this video is
02:17 - that the document object model is
02:19 - technically an API that is inside of
02:21 - your browser it is easy to use so even
02:25 - if you can't wrap your head around the
02:27 - concept of the document object model
02:29 - necessarily
02:30 - don't be intimidated by it and don't be
02:32 - afraid to start using languages like
02:33 - JavaScript and the library like jQuery
02:36 - to start changing the context of a page
02:39 - without changing the actual HTML when
02:42 - you do that using these languages or
02:44 - other languages you are manipulating the
02:46 - document object model
